AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE JULY 1900  Number 14  Selected Official Documents OF THE South African Republic AND Great Britain A documentary perspective of the causes of the war in South Africa EDITED BY HUGH WILLIAMS M A B L S Library of Congress AND FREDERICK CHARLES HICKS Ph B Library of Congress KRAUS REPRINT CO New York 1970Copyright 1900 by the American Academy of Political and Social Science Reprinted with the permission of the original publisher KRAUS REPRINT CO A US Division of KrausThomson Organization Limited Printed in GermanyPREFACE The universal interest in the affairs of the South African Republic is responsible for the idea that a selection of docu ments illustrative of the South African controversy will be appreciated by American readers The documents which are here reprinted are by no means unobtainable but to the general reader they have been hitherto quite inaccessible Only the largest public libraries have the proper sources of information and even with these books at hand the student has been forced to delve in a mass of irrelevant material for the hidden object of his desire The present compilation has been made in the hope of meeting the immediate demands of the public To avoid cumbersomeness many important documents have neces sarily been omitted yet as far as possible the editors have given a complete series of documents The arrangement is partly chronological and we hope altogether logical Com mencing with the London Convention of 1884 which defines the status of the South African Republic in its relations with Great Britain we follow with the revised Constitution of 1889 and its complementary law of June 23 I89o which granted representation in a second Volksraad to burghers of two years standing The latest legislation concerning the right of franchise is given in the enactment of July 1899 This law together with negotiations looking toward further concessions to the Uitlander population forms the subject of our third chapter No agreement having been reached and numerous complications having arisen conspicuously the movements of British troops the Ultimatum of Presi dent Kruger on October 9 precipitated a state of war In presenting this Ultimatum President Kruger knew that the Republic would not have to fight alone but that there would be practically a war of the South African Dutch 34 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY against the English The declaration of the Orange Free State to Great Britain will therefore be of interest as expressing the grounds of sympathy between the South African Republic and the Orange Free State and the latters view of the causa belli Lastly we add the constitution of the Orange Free State that the political status of the two republics may be appreciated by comparison of their consti tutions The documents have been compiled from the Codex van de Locale Wetten der ZuidAfrikaansche Republiek Gran ingen 1894 The Political Laws of the South

Government authorize me to invite President of South African Republic to appoint delegates to discuss with delegates to be appointed by me on behalf of Her Majestys Government whether Uitlander population will be given immediate and substantial representation by fran chise law recently passed by Volksraad together with other measures connected with it such as increase of seats and if not what additions or alterations may be necessary to secure that result In this discussion it should be understood that the delegates of Her Majestys Government would be free to make any suggestions calculated to improve measures in question and secure their attaining the end desired Per sonally I wish to add the expression of my earnest hope that Government of South African Republic may accept this pro posal and that we may proceed to discuss the composition of the proposed Commission method of procedure and place of meeting at once Government of South African Republic will I feel sure agree with me that if proposal of Her Majestys Government is accepted the inquiry should be held as soon as possible ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC F W Reitz to British Agent 19th August Sir With reference to your proposal for a joint enquiry in your dispatches of the 2nd and 3rd August Govern ment of South African Republic have the honour to suggest 454 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the following alternative proposal for consideration of Her Majestys Government which this Government trusts may lead to a final settlement I The Government are willing to recommend to the Volksraad and the people a 5 years retrospective franchise as proposed by His Excellency the High Commissioner on the Ist June 1899 2 The Gov ernment are further willing to recommend to the Volksraad that 8 new seats in the First Volksraad and if necessary also in the Second Volksraad be given to the population of the Witwatersrand thus with the 2 sitting members for the Goldfields giving to the population thereof Io repre sentatives in a Raad of 36 and in future the repre sentation of the Goldfields of this Republic shall not fail below the proportion of onefourth of the total 3 The new burghers shall equally with the old burghers be en titled to vote at the election for State President and Com mandantGeneral 4 This Government will always be prepared to take into consideration such friendly suggestions regarding the details of the Franchise Law as Her Majestys Government through the British Agent may wish to convey to it 5 In putting forward the above proposals Govern ment of South African Republic assumes a That Her Majestys Government will agree that the present interven tion shall not form a precedent for future similar action and that in the future no interference in the internal affairs of the Republic will take place b That Her Majestys Government will not further insist on the assertion of the suzerainty the controversy on the subject being allowed tacitly to drop c That arbitration from which foreign element other than Orange Free State is to be excluded will be conceded as soon as the franchise scheme has become law 6 Immediately on Her Majestys Government ac cepting this proposal for a settlement the Government will ask the Volksraad to adjourn for the purpose of consulting the people about it and the whole scheme might become law say within a few weeks 7 In the meantime the form andSOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC AND GREAT BRITAIN 55 scope of the proposed Tribunal are also to be discussed and provisionally agreed upon while the franchise scheme is being referred to the people so that no time may be lost in putting an end to the present state of affairs The Govern ment trust that Her Majestys Government will clearly un derstand that in the opinion of this Government the exist ing franchise law of this Republic is both fair and liberal to the new population and that the consideration that induces them to go further as they do in the above proposals is their strong desire to get the controversies between the two Governments settled and further to put an end to present strained relations between the two Governments and the incalculable harm and loss it has already occasioned in South Africa and to prevent a racial war from the effects of which South Africa may not recover for many generations per haps never at all and therefore this Government having re regard to all these circumstances would highly appreciate it if Her Majestys Government seeing the necessity of pre venting the present crisis from developing still further and the urgency of an early termination of the present state of affairs would expedite the acceptance or refusal of the settle ment here offered 2zst August Sir In continuation of my dispatch of the 19th instant and with reference to the communication to you of the State Attorney this morning I wish to forward to you the following in explanation thereof with the request that the same may be telegraphed to His Excellency the High Commissioner for South Africa as forming part of the proposals of this Gov ernment embodied in the abovenamed dispatch I The proposals of this Government regarding question of fran chise and representation contained in that dispatch must be regarded as expressly conditional on Her Majestys Gov ernment consenting to the points set forth in paragraph 5 of the dispatch viz a In future not to interfere in internal56 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY affairs of the South African Republic b Not to insist further on its assertion of existence of suzerainty c To agree to arbitration 2 Referring to paragraph6 of the dispatch this Government trusts that it is clear to Her Majestys Government that this Government has not con sulted the Volksraad as to this question and will only do so when an affirmative reply to its proposals has been received from Her Majestys Government NOTE In reply to the above proposals of the South African Republic the Secretary of State for the Colonies declared Great Britain unable to appreciate the objections enter tained by the Government of the South African Republic to a Joint Commission of Inquiry and refused to enter into a consideration of the alternative proposals of the South African Republic As a consequence of this refusal the South African Re public communicated to Great Britain that the proposal for a five years franchise and extension of representation of the Witwatersrand with the conditions attached thereto had lapsed whereby also lapsed the necessity of laying it before the representatives of the people for ratification During the month of September following the negotia tions failed to produce any agreement and matters remained in this unsatisfactory state until on October 9 1899 the ultimatum of President Kruger brought affairs to an actual crisisCHAPTER IV ULTIMATUM OF SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC OCTOBER 9 1899 The Government of the South African Republic feels itself compelled to refer the Government of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland once more to the Con vention of London 1884 concluded between this Republic and the United Kingdom and which in its XIVth Article secures certain specified rights to the white population of this Republic namely that All persons other than natives conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic a will have full liberty with their families to enter travel or reside in any part of the South African Republic b they will be entitled to hire or possess houses manufactories warehouses shops and premises c they may carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents whom they may think fit to employ d they will not be subject in respect of their persons or property or in respect of their commerce or industry to any taxes whether general or local other than those which are or may be im posed upon citizens of the said Republic This Govern ment wishes further to observe that the above are only rights which Her Majestys Government have reserved in the above Convention with regard to the Uitlander population of this Republic and that the violation only of those rights could give that Government a right to diplomatic representations or intervention while moreover the regulation of all other questions affecting the position or the rights of the Uitlander population under the abovementioned Convention is handed over to the Government and the representatives of the people of the South African Republic Amongst the questions the regulation of which falls exclusively within the competence of the Government and of the Volksraad are included those 5758 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of the franchise and representation of the people in this Republic and although thus the exclusive right of this Gov ernment and of the Volksraad for the regulation of that franchise and representation is indisputable yet this Govern ment has found occasion to discuss in a friendly fashion the franchise and the representation of the people with Her Majestys Government without however recognizing any rights thereto on the part of Her Majestys Government This Government has also by the formu lation of the now existing Franchise Law and the Reso lution with regard to representation constantly held these friendly discussions before its eyes On the part of Her Majestys Government however the friendly nature of these discussions has assumed a more and more threatening tone and the minds of the people in this Republic and in the whole of South Africa have been excited and a condition of extreme tension has been created while Her Majestys Government could no longer agree to the legislation re specting franchise and the Resolution respecting representa tion in this Republic and finally by your note of 25th Sep tember I899 broke off all friendly correspondence on the subject and intimated that they must now proceed to formu late their own proposals for a final settlement and this Gov ernment can only see in the above intimation from Her Majestys Government a new violation of the Convention of London 1884 which does not reserve to Her Majestys Gov ernment the right to a unilateral settlement of a question which is exclusively a domestic one for this Government and has already been regulated by it On account of the strained situation and the consequent serious loss in and interruption of trade in general which the correspondence respecting the franchise and representa tion in this Republic carried in its train Her Majestys Gov ernment have recently pressed for an early settlement and finally pressed by your intervention for an answer within fortyeight hours subsequently somewhat modified to yourSOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC AND GREAT BRITAIN 59 note of the 12th September replied to by the note of this Government of the 15th September and your note of the 25th September I899 and thereafter further friendly nego tiations broke off and this Government received the intima tion that the proposal for a final settlement would shortly be made but although this promise was once more repeated no proposal has up to now reached this Government Even while friendly correspondence was still going on an increase of troops on a large scale was introduced by Her Majestys Government and stationed in the neighborhood of the bor ders of this Republic Having regard to occurrences in the history of this Republic which it is unnecessary here to call to mind this Government felt obliged to regard this military force in the neighborhood of its borders as a threat against the independence of the South African Republic since it was aware of no circumstances which could justify the presence of such military force in South Africa and in the neighborhood of its borders In answer to an inquiry with respect thereto addressed to His Excellency the High Commissioner this Government received to its great aston ishment in answer a veiled insinuation that from the side of the Republic van Republikeinsche zyde an attack was being made on Her Majestys Colonies and at the same time a mysterious reference to possibilities whereby it was strengthened in its suspicion that the independence of this Republic was being threatened As a defensive measure it was therefore obliged to send a portion of the burghers of this Republic in order to offer the requisite resistance to sim ilar possibilities Her Majestys unlawful intervention in the internal affairs of this Republic in conflict with the Conven tion of London 1884 caused by the extraordinary strengthening of troops in the neighborhood of the borders of this Republic has thus caused an intolerable condition of things to arise whereto this Government feels itself obliged in the interest not only of this Republic but also of all South Africa to make an end as soon as possible and feels60 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY itself called upon and obliged to press earnestly and with emphasis for an immediate termination of this state of things and to request Her Majestys Government to give it the assurance a That all points of mutual difference shall be regulated by the friendly course of arbitration or by what ever amicable way may be agreed upon by this Government with Her Majestys Government b That the troops on the borders of this Republic shall be instantly withdrawn c That all reinforcements of troops which have arrived in South Africa since the Ist June 1899 shall be removed from South Africa within a reasonable time to be agreed upon with this Government and with a mutual assurance and guarantee on the part of this Government that no attack upon or hostili ties against any portion of the possessions of the British Government shall be made by the Republic during further negotiations within a period of time to be subsequently agreed upon between the Gov ernments and this Government will on compliance therewith be prepared to withdraw the armed burghers of this Republic from the borders d That Her Majestys troops which are now on the high seas shall not be landed in any port of South Africa This Government must press for an immediate and affirmative answer to these four questions and earnestly requests Her Majestys Government to return such an an swer before or upon Wednesday the IIth October 1899 not later than 5 oclock p m and it desires further to add that in the event of unexpectedly no satisfactory answer being received by it within that interval it will with great regret be compelled to regard the action of Her Majestys Govern ment as a formal declaration of war and will not hold itself responsible for the consequences thereof and that in the event of any further movements of troops taking placeSOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC AND GREAT BRITAIN 61 within the abovementioned time in the nearer directions of our borders this Government will be compelled to regard that also as a formal declaration of war REPLY OF GREAT BRITAIN October zo z899 Her Majestys Government have received with great regret the peremptory demands of the Government of the South African Republic conveyed in your telegram of 9th October No 3 You will inform the Government of the South African Republic in reply that the conditions demanded by the Government of the South African Re public are such as Her Majestys Government deem it im possible to discussCHAPTER V DUAL ALLIANCE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC AND THE ORANGE FREE STATE Resolution of Orange Free State September 27 I899 The Volksraad having heard the second paragraph of His Honors opening speech and the official documents and correspondence relating thereto which have been handed in having regard to the strained state of affairs in South Africa which have arisen in consequence of the differences between the Governments of South African Republic and Her Britannic Majesty which constitute a threatening danger for bringing about hostilities the calamitous effect of which would be incalculable for all white inhabitants of South Africa being bound to the South African Republic by the closest bonds of blood and alliance and standing in most friendly relations towards Her Majestys Government fearing that should a war break out a hatred would be generated between the European races in South Africa which still in the far future will impede and restrain the peaceful development of all States and Colonies of South Africa being sensible that serious obligations rest on the Volksraad to do all that is possible to prevent the shedding of blood considering that in the course of negotiations with the British Government which have extended over several months every endeavor has been made by the Government of the South African Republic at a peaceful settlement of the differences which have been brought forward by Uit landers in the South African Republic and which have been adopted as its own cause by the Government of Her Majesty which endeavors unfortunately have only had the result that British troops have been concentrated on the border of the South African Republic and are still con tinually being reinforced 62SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC AND GREAT BRITAIN 63 Resolves to instruct the Government still further to do everything in its power to preserve and establish peace and to contribute by peaceful methods towards the solution of the existing differences always provided that it can be brought about without injury to the honour and indepen dence of this State or of the South African Republic and wishes unmistakably to declare its opinion that there exists no cause for war and that if a war is now begun or occa sioned by Her Majestys Government against South African Republic this would morally be a war against the whole of white population of South Africa and would in its results be calamitous and criminal and further that Orange Free State will honestly and faithfully observe its obligations towards South African Republic arising out of the political alliance between the two Republics whatever may happen CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND ORANGE FREE STATE Sir Alfred Milner to President Steyn October I1 899 In view of resolution of Volksraad of Orange Free State communicated to me in Your Honours telegram of 27th September I have the honour to request that I may be in formed at Your Honours earliest possible convenience whether this action on the part of the South African Re public has Your Honours concurrence and support President of Orange Free State to Sir Alfred Milner October r 1899 I have the honour to acknowledge Your Excellencys tele grams of this evening The highhanded and unjustifiable policy and conduct of Her Majestys Government in interfer ing in and dictating in the purely

by active commencement of hos tilities against that Republic which no friendly and well intentioned efforts on our part could induce Her Majestys Government to abandon constitute such an undoubted and unjust attack on the independence of the South African Re public that no other course is left to this State than honour ably to abide by its Conventional Agreements entered into with that Republic On behalf of this Government there fore I beg to notify that compelled thereto by the action of Her Majestys Government they intend to carry out the instructions of the Volksraad as set forth in the last

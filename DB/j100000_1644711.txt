funds for mathe matical projects quite unlike the case with some of the more spectacular sciences The presumption is prevalent among nonmathe maticians that mathematics is an organized and crystallized body of necessary conclusions drawn some decades or centuries ago from certain intuitional concepts of number and form and that no special provision for equip ment or funds is necessary for carrying on mathematical work On the contrary it is the purpose of this paper to show that mathematics as a live and active subject is in need of funds for its pro mulgation as much as any other science For example the following needs may be men tioned 1 A revolving book fund for the publica tion of mathematical treatises It has not been possible on account of economic conditions for an author to secure the publication of a mathematical treatise by one of the commercial publishing houses for several years past and apparently will not be possible for some time to come It is well known that such treatises of worthy character are awaiting publication but that not even second or subsequent vol umes will be accepted by publishing houses which have already printed the preceding vol umes The only remedy for this most unfor tunate situation is a subsidy fund which may be drawn upon to guarantee the cost of pub lication such guaranty to be returned in whole or in part to the fund whenever the sales may so warrant A lump sum of 25000 could be wisely used at once for this purpose and should be handled through the American Mathematical Society 2 A mathematical dictionary in English There is no mathematical dictionary in any language that is even approximately up to date Students and workers of all kinds in 1 A paper presented to the joint meeting of the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America at Toronto Ontario December 29 1921 mathematics and in fields in any way related to mathematics should have the benefit of the best dictionary in the English language that can be made The Mathematical Association of America has already considered this matter in great detail even to the careful estimating of the scope and size of such a publication and of the cost of its preparation A lump sum of 100000 or of 20000 per year for five years will be needed for the preparation of the manuscript Such a work would be monumental in character and would insure great honor to any donor 3 Publication of a historical journal in English As is well known the only mathe matical journal in the historical field the Bibliotheca Mathematica has been entirely suspended on account of economic conditions Its venerable editor Mr G Enestrom has appealed to friends in this country to assist in continuing this journal as an American pub lication The American Mathematical Monthly has recently made a serious effort to secure funds for combining the Bibliotheca with the Monthly but so far without success A fund of 2000 per year or an endowment of 40000 would be needed in order to appro priately perpetuate the long and honorable record of this journal and to do this would not only render assistance in a most worthy cause but would bring honor to America and to any donor who should make it possible 4 Enlargement of our mathematical re search journals It is a distressing fact that all of our mathematical research journals are in crying need of more space for the publica tion of scores of articles already accepted The American Journal of Mathematics the Annals of Mathematics and the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society should all be brought up to at least five hundred pages per volume and the latter could well be extended to six hundred pages But this could not be done at present and probably not for a long time to come without a subsidy fund of at least 2500 a year or an endowment of 50000 In addi tion to this space the Transactions would need a whole extra volume at a cost of about 4000 in order to catch up with available worthy contributions 146 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 10 1922 5 Expansion of the American Mathemat ical Monthly It has long been the hope of those in charge of the American Mathematical Monthly that it might become possible to pub lish two extra numbers in July and August of each year to be devoted entirely to expos itory and historical articles of an elementary character suited to the needs of students and teachers of mathematics in the normal schools and colleges throughout the country This need is great and the service thus rendered would be of inestimable value The regular volume of the Monthly should also be ex panded by eighty pages in order to handle matter pressing for publication For these purposes an annual subsidy of 2000 would be needed or an endowment of 40000 6 Publication of mathematical mono graphs A subsidy fund has recently been donated to the Mathematical Association of America by Mrs Mary Hegeler Carus as trustee of the Edward C Hegeler Trust Fund for the purpose of publishing a series of math ematical monographs which shall provide in convenient and readable form and at low cost expository presentations of all the great sub jects in pure and applied mathematics This gift is in the form of an annual subsidy of 1200 for five years with the promise of capi talizing this income in perpetuity if the project proves successful Such an endowment would need to be 24000 on a five per cent basis 7 A mathematical abstract journal A journal in the English language of abstracts of mathematical publications has long been needed and became very urgent during and subsequent to the world war when foreign abstract journals were suspended or were hopelessly in arrears Such a journal of the high character and efficiency contemplated by the committee of the National Research Coun cil and the American Mathematical Society could only be produced and maintained with a liberal subsidyat least 15000 annually or with an endowment of 300000 8 A bibliography of bibliographies in mathematics The National Research Council has proposed as one aid to efficiency in scien tific work to publish a bibliography of bibli ographies in each of the various sciences which shall combine in one volume all the bibliographies obtainable in a given science whether published hitherto or not The council will bear the cost of publication and clerical expense but the work involved in preparation of the manuscript will be extensive and should be covered by a lump sum of 5000 9 Prizes and research fellowships Some thing seems to be wrong when a poem or a short story may bring its author adequate financial reward while the author of a mathe matical article of the highest merit on which he may have spent weeks or months not only receives no financial return but actually has to pay cash for a few reprints The only means apparently available to offset this injustice is through prizes and fellowships of liberal value One bequest of 10000 and one or two small funds for prizes none of which are operative as yet constitute the sum total of effort to date in this country An annual fund of 25000 or an endowment of 500000 would be only a fair estimate of the need in this line and such an annual expenditure could be used to the utmost advantage with the greatest degree of justice to the workers in the field of mathematics Fortunately some farsighted and loyal individuals are thinking of these things and are contemplating liberal provi sions in wills toward this end One such will is already definitely known to be made 10 Honorary stipends for executive offi cers Time was in most scientific societies when one or two permanent executive officers worked like slaves for the upbuilding of these organizations with no financial return and sometimes even without adequate clerical assist ance Those days of pioneering should be gone forever In some societies the membership is large enough or includes those with large incomes outside the teaching profession so that the annual dues may be made adequate to cover salaries to their executive officers but those societies whose members are almost en tirely teachers in the universities and small colleges cannot raise their dues beyond certain maximum amounts without shutting out large numbers to whom the organizations are of the utmost value The only other alternatives seem to be either to continue the old pioneer methods or else to secure adequate subsidy funds with which to give these hard worked permanent SCIENCE 147SCIENCE officers respectable honorary stipends In the American Mathematical Society and the Math ematical Association of America there are four such officers to whom honorary stipends of at least 1000 each should be given annually For this purpose an endowment of 80000 is needed In this case again farsighted and loyal individuals are contemplating bequests and one or two such wills with liberal pro visions are known to be already made Also a special gift toward this end has just been promised to the association for the coming year It will be found that the totals of the above ten items as estimated are as follows For lump sums 134000 and for annual subsidies 51700 or if capitalized at five per cent an endowment of 1034000 As stated under 6 the provision for mathematical mono graphs is already made and under 9 and 10 beginnings have been made by bequests provided for in wills or by special cash gifts Also in connection with 2 it should be said that the proposition is under favorable con sideration by a prospective donor A donation of this magnitude would indeed be a monu ment worthy of great honor to the donor and would render a service of untold value to the cause of education The same may be said in varying degrees of all the items enumerated It is believed that when information concerning these needs becomes sufficiently widespread there will be liberal responses in supplying the funds1 1 As this article goes to the printer a donor offers to provide the items of 4000 mentioned in 4 Also a report in SCIENCE for January 13 of grants made by the Heckscher Research Foun dation contains three items amounting to 2600 for mathematics Possibly this latter amount is the one quoted in the same issue of ScIENcE page 52 where grants for research in twelve sciences range from 352000 for biology down to 2600 for mathematics The compiler seems not sur prised that mathematics brings up the rear since he says that it would probably appear to most of us to be the subject farthest removed from practical interests His surprise will doubtless be great when he contemplates a pro posal for a million dollar endowment fund for mathematics In this connection attention may be called to the fact that an important and urgent need of mathematics has already been recognized and met by the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation in financing the work of the National Committee on Mathe matical Requirements a committee working under the auspices of the Mathematical Asso ciation of America This work has extended over a period of three years and the funds supplied will total over 65000 when the exhaustive report of the committee is pub lished in a volume of five or six hundred pages H E SLAUGHT CHICAGO JANUARY 2 1922 SCIENTIFIC EVENTS

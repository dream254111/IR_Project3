j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098657,What Is Such a Promise To Answer for the Debt of Another as Is Required to Be in Writing Signed by Sec 4 of the Statute of Frauds,i245828,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Rep 783 and note And for the importance of the buyers notifying tile seller that the chattel is claimed by a third person and requiring him to defend the action see Burt v Dewey 40 N Y 283 100 Am Dec 482 citing Sweetman v Prince 26 N Y 224 WHAT IS SUCCH A PROMISE TO ANSWER FOR THE DEBT OF ANOTHER  AS IS REQUIRED TO BE IN WRITING SIGNED BY SEC 4 OF THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS See Code Va sec 2840 Several requisites must concur 1 The promise must be made to the creditor A promise to the debtor to pay his debt for him is not within the statute and if on sufficient consideration is binding though made verbally Easlwood v Kenyon 11 Ad  E 438 And the reason why a promise to save another harmless from the consequences of his acts Indemnity Anson on Contracts p 59 does not require to be in writing is that such promise is made to him who is to become liable the quasi debtor and not to him to whom the liability would be incurred the quasi creditor In the latter case writing is required 2 The promise must be to pay a debt as guarantor for which debt another person is primarily liable If A goes into Bs shop and says  Let C have goods and if he does not pay you I will this is a collateral promise or guaranty and unless in writing and signed by A is unenforceable but it is otherwise when A says to B Let C have goods on my account or  Let C have goods and charge me with them Thus in Hendricks v Robinson 56 Miss 694 s c 31 Am Rep 382 the promise of Dulaney to pay Robinson for the goods supplied by him to Hendricks did not require to be in writing as Hendricks was never liable at all the credit being given entirely and solely to Dulaney though the goods were delivered by his order to Hendricks And the subsequent promise by Hendricks to Robin son to pay for the goods did require to be in writing for it was to answer for the debt of another that of Dulaney and besides it was void for lack of consideration the only consideration being moral if indeed there was even a moral obligation on Hendricks to pay under the circumstances 3 The principal liability while it may be prospective must be real i e it must be incurred at some t4me Thus in Mountstephen v Lakeman L R 7 H L 17 a contractor the plaintiff offered to make a sidedrain into the main sewer if the defendant or the town would be responsible The defendant said Go on and do the work and I will see you paid The town hlad never authorized the construction of the sidedrain and it refused to assume the liability It was held that the defendant was liable without writing as principal debtor the words I will see you paid imposing a primary liability on himself But it was said that even if the defendants promise had been collateral e g If the town wont pay you I will still no writing would have been required The town was never re sponsible but only himself So that his promise could not be to answer for the debt of another within the meaning of the Statute of Frauds 4 The liability of the original debtor must continue Thus in Goodman v Chase 1 B  Aid 297 the defendant promised the creditor to pay the debt if the creditor would release the debtor from prison where he was confined for the debt under a writ of Ca Sa now abolished The law was that such release of a debtor operated ipso facto to discharge the debtor from his debt Thus the dis charge of the debtor extinguished his debt and left the defendant alone liable 464 Octas principal and not for the debt of another So defendant was held liable on his promise without writing In addition to the above it has been held in some cases that where the promise to pay the debt of another arises out of some new and original consideratton it is not within the Statute of Frauds See Smith on Contracts 7th ed 112 Hopkins v Richardson 9 Gratt 494 Wright v Smith 81 Va 777 For an examination of this doctrine see Harriman on Contracts p 197 where various distinctions are suggested The doctrine is repudiated in England And see Noyes v Humphries 11 Gratt 636 at p 645 per Allen P EMBLEMENTS IN VIRGINIAWhen the owner of land dies intestate and it descends to the heir a distinction is made between such unsevered vegetable products as are raised annually by cultivation and labor fructus industriales and such as are the natural products of the ground fructLs naturales The former class called emblements are considered personalty and pass to the administrator while the latter class those not emblements are regarded as part of the realty and go with the land to the heir Emblements may be defined as the annual re sults of agricultural labor i e the crops which repay the labor bestowed upon them within the year and they belong to the administrator because the personal estate is expended in their production and should therefore be increased by their value Accordingly crops of corn wheat and other cereals potatoes and other root crops cotton hemp flax etc are emblements and go to the administrator while timber fruittrees fruit grass clover etc are not emblements and pass to the heir 3 Redf Wills 150155 4 Lead Cases Real Prop 517 Tied Real Prop sec 71 note 4 When however land is devised the devisee is entitled at common law to all unsevered vegetable products thereon those which are emblements as well as those which are not the devise of the land importing a gift of all that is affixed to it no distinction being made between timber fruit and grass on the one hand and wheat corn tobacco etc on the other West v Moore 8 East 339 Bradner v Faulkner 34 N Y 347 Dennet v Hopkinson 63 Me 350 18 Am Rep 227 1 Lomax Exors 410 3 Redfield Wills 154 As to the right in Virginia of a devisee to the emblements it was held in Shel ton v Shelton 1 Wash Va 53 that under the statute then in force a devise of land where the testator died after March 1 would not pass to the devisee the crops unsevered at the testators death unless such intent was manifested by the will But see Fleming v Boiling 3 Call 75 82 explaining Shelton v Shelton as a case under the statute and admitting the common law to have been otherwise And see 1 Lom Ex 421 as to the effect of the Code of 1849 ch 139 sec 2 But however the law may have been formerly it is believed that now in Virginia a devise of land will carry the emblements to the devisee unless a contrary intention is expressed in the will For the Code of 1887 sec 2806 declares that in all cases the right to emblements shall be as at common law and by the common law a devise of land to A gave him the emblements And see Bradner v Fawdk ner 34 N Y 347 which is e contra to Shelton I Shelton on the construction of a very similar statute As to the right of tenant for life to emblements see 2 Bl Corn 122 When 18961 465 FOR THE JUNIORS

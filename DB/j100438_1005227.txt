other Bones of the Mastodon By William E Horner M D and Isaac Hays M D Read October 2 1840 THE undersigned a committee appointed by the Society January 3d 1840 to report a descriptian of the collection of Mastodon bones recently presented to the Society by some of its members have the honour to submit the follow ing account According to the statement of Mr D Wood from whom these bones were purchased they were disoovered two years since about seven feet below the surface of the ground in digging a millrace on the estate of Abraham Halm threefourths of a mile east of Bucyrus Crawford County Ohio on the dividing ridge between the Sandusky and Sciota valleys This ridge consisting of table land is one of the highest elevations in Ohio is well cultivated and abounds in neverfailing springs which constitute the sources of the Sandusky and Sciota rivers The waters of the former flow into Lake Erie by a course almost due North and those of the latter into the Ohio by a course nearly due South The soil in which the bones were buried is entirely alluvial The collection contains portions of the skeletons of two animals one larger than the other The bones of the larger of these animals are lighter more worn more decomposed and larger in their specific measurements than the other and are of a different colour All these bones were sold as common to one skeleton but that they appertained to different individuals is sufficiently substantiated from what is alleged and moreover by some of the carpal bones of the right side being in duplicate Whether or not all were really exhumed from the same spot cannot now be ascertained by the committee VIIIK38 DESCRIPTION OF AN ENTIRE HEAD Though both skeletons have been inhumed they do not seem to be fossil ized The first set has a much lighter specific gravity than corresponding re cent bones would have and the second set has about the same specific gravity as the latter or perhaps a somewhat greater but yet with a freshness of sur face and of texture which would seem to indicate that either no very long interval could have elapsed since the death of the animal or that the soil in which they were deposited possessed unusual preservative powers Of the skeleton of the larger animal there are the following pieces A fragment of the pelvis containing the right acetabulum Inferior end of right scapula Inferior end of left scapula a small fragment Upper end of right radius and ulna with olecranon process the latter de tached LunareTrapeziumTrapezoides of right carpus Head of a rib Ten fragments of vertebra c and a number of undetermined fragments much comminuted The long diameter of the glenoid cavity of the scapula measures nine and a half inches The diameter of the acetabulum is seven and a half inches The lunare is three and threeeiglhths of an inch in thickness Upon the preceding data this animal was from a thirteenth to a tenth larger than the Mastodon of the Philadelphia Museum whose scapula has a glenioid cavity of eight and threefourths of an inch in its long diameter and an aceta bulum of six and threefourths of an inch in diameter The bones of the second or smaller animal are in a state of fine preserva tion and consist of A complete head Six anterior cervical vertebrae Six vertebrae of thorax and loins complete and some fragments of same class of bones Sacrum complete and seven succeeding caudal bones The left innominatum complete the riaht ischium and pubes with some fragments of right ilium Thirteen ribs of right side Eighteen ribs of left sideAND VARIOUS OTHER BONES OF THE MASTODON 39 Os humeri of right side Scaphoides lunare cuneiform and unciform of right carpus Os femoris tibia and os calcis of right side Radius and ulna of left side Tibia fibula and patella of left side Os calcis astragalus scaphoides and cuboides of left tarsus Conformation of Head The occipital bone see Plate I fig 1 forms a plane looking backwards and upwards roughened by the insertion of muscles its superior semicircular ridge is extremely scabrous and makes a well defined angle with the top of the head There is no hemispherical protuberance on each side of it as in the Asiatic Elephant see Plate IV fig 2 e on the contrary the plane of the occipital bone is slightly depressed near the centre of each side The insertion of the ligamentum nucha3 is somewhat depressed and very scabrous and makes a triangular area the base of which being the line of the occipital ridge is five inches wide from this it extends downwards eight and a half inches to wards the foramen magnum it is divided symmetrically by a wellmarked vertical ridge The occipital condyles rise immediately from the surface of the bone instead of standing out on a high base as in the Elephant they form onethird of a circle and measure nearly six and threefourths inches in length by two and threefourths in breadth The plane of the occiput and the cuneiform process form in their relation to each other a right angle upon which is placed the condyles The cranium see Plate II fig 1 presents in front a flattened or slightly raised convexity from the occipital ridge to the anterior nares and exhibits there an area of one foot eight inches long by one foot two and a half inches wide between the temporal fossEe The plane of the occiput and the upper front part of the cranium make at their line of junction a well defined angle of ninetyfive degrees see Plate III In an Elephant belonging to the Wistar Museum the corresponding portion is rounded but if designated by supposititious planes the latter would meet at an angle of eightyfive degrees The incisive fossa see Plate IV fig 1 a of upper maxilla is distinguished40 DESCRIPTION OF AN ENTIRE HEAD by great depth and terminates above in a narrow profound pit which pene trates two inches under the anterior nares Besides the ordinary infraorbitary foramen there is a second much smaller one a branch from the former and placed three inches within and above it This second infraorbitary foramen has four superficial sulci two within and two without radiating from it and indicating the direction of nerves and bloodvessels The malar bone is much broader than in the Elephant The conformation of the orbit is like that of the latter animal but it is a section of a more regular circle and is six and a half inches in diameter Two and a half inches poste rior to the spine of bone at the internal margin of the orbiti near its middle there is a small canal which leads to the infraorbitar canal and which in the Elephant is merely a groove The orbit has the same relative position as in the Elephant in which respect Cuvier  has been led into error by the de claration of Mr Pealet that there was no trace of orbit at the anterior part of the arch zygomatic for we find this arch continued into the orbit of the Mastodon just as in the Elephant the greater breadth of the malar bone in the former making the chief difference The zygomatic suture is nearly the same as in the Elephant The meatus auditorius externus see Plate I fig 1 is a compressed oval orifice the distance of which from the anterior margin of the orbit is seventeen and a half inches The temporal fossa is broad deep and nearly uniformly concave with very little of that convexity near its posterior part which exists in the Elephant The pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone said by Cuvier to be larger than in any other quadruped are eight inches in length have a wellmarked fossa and present no inconsiderable resemblance to those in the human subject which is not the case in the Elephant The tuber of the upper maxillary bone is not so full as in the latter The hard palate is destitute of a notch behind which exists in the Elephant being flush it is in its whole length nearly a plane instead of curving down abruptly at its anterior portion as in the Elephant It measures from its pos terior margin to its anterior at a central point between the edges of tlle alveoli of the tusks two feet two inches The temporal bone presents the articular surface for the lower jaw exclu  Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles Vol IL p 301

shape that on the trapezium of the human hand for the thumb except that it is proportionately more oblong as it measures five inches by two and a half its margin is sharp elevated and well defined There is behind the tubercle a depression corresponding with the glenoid cavity of the Elephant but it is narrow deep and rough it appears not to have had a coating of carti lage and from its constricted condition could not have entered into the con tour of the temporomaxillary joint The upper maxilla has a tooth on each side which measures seven and a fourth by four and a half inches These teeth converge behind and were placed four inches in advance of the pterygoid process they are furnished with five denticules which are much worn The left alveolus for tusk in the incisive bone is very complete the right one is slightly mutilated at the margin Their depth is nineteen inches transverse diameter four and threefourths of an inchand vertical diameter five and a half inches The following supplementary measurements may be of some value From end of alveoli of tusks to occipital condyles three feet two inches Prom inferior margin of foramen magnum to vertex one foot five inches Transverse diameter of occiput two feet two inches From vertex to spine of bone between anterior nares one foot nine inches From orbit to orbit one foot nine inches Incisive fossa four inches deep From posterior margin of pterygoid process of sphenoid bone to anterior edge of alveoli for tusks two feet four inches From anterior edge of foramen magnum to posterior nares five inches Depth of temporal fossa from bottom to the crown of the zygomatic arch nine inches From superior margin of temporal fossa to inferior margin of pterygoid pro cess one foot ten inches Diameter of orbit six and a half inches Across alveoli for tusks and immediately below infra orbitary foramen six teen inches Across alveoli for tusks at their inferior end eighteen inches and a half VIHIL42 DESCRIPTION OF AN ENTIRE HEAD Breadth of malar bone just at orbit six inches From posterior margin of tooth to posterior margin of os palati six inches Lorver JawThe conformation of this is similar to that of the jaw belonging to the Baltimore Museum and described by one of the members of the Com mittee Its body is semicylindrical on the external face there is a deep round groove just above the symphysis and which presents a rough foliated margin on each side considerably expanded The chin presents no alveoli for tusks as in the Titracaulodon of Godmant neither are there traces of such alveoli ever having existed The jaw contains one tooth on each side with five denticules each with two points all worn and most so at their outer edge In front of these teeth are re mains of the alveoli of the deciduous teeth preceding them The teeth are parallel the left measures eight inches by four and a halfthe right eight and a quarter by four and threequarters of an inch The length of this jaw is two feet six inches The height of ramus fifteen inches and its breadth ten inches The condyle is nearly transverse in its long diameter with a slight inclination of the latter inwards and backwards it has no groove dividing its articular surface into an inner and outer portion as in the specimen in the Baltimore Museum though there is a faint indication of one The coronoid process rises an inch and a half higher than the condyle the latter measures five and a half inches in its long diameter The angle of the bone is rather well defined and obtuse VERTEBRAE The vertebrw of which there are as stated specimens of eaoh class have a conformation analagous to those of the Elephant The first cervical vertebra see Plate I Fig 2 measures fourteen inches between the tips of the transverse processes and ten inches from the anterior to the posterior margin immediately behind the superior oblique process there is also a perfect canal for conveying the vertebral artery into the foramen mag num occipitis

SeriesAND VARIOUS OTHER BONES OF THE MASTODON 43 The second cervical vertebra see Plate I Fig 3 exhibits in its processus dentatus a broad regular cone elevated one and a half inches and whose sum mit reaches to the level of the internal margin of the superior oblique processes of the first vertebra Its spinous process is more robust than in the Elephant and comes in contact with that of the first by a broad wellmarked surface This vertebra in the specimen before us is anchylosed with the third in almost the whole length of the long bridge between the oblique processes inclusive Its transverse diameter in the body is seven and a half inchesand the antero posterior diameter from the front of the body to the tip of the spinous process measures ten inches The spinous process of the third fourth fifth and sixth vertebrae is very small and short These vertebrme are nearly circular see Plate II Fig 2 and measure nearly six inches in diameter and nearly two and a half inches in thickness in their bodies They shoot up from the anterior root of the trans verse process a conical spine sixteen or eighteen inches in height which sets close against the body of the vertebra above and assists materially in prevent ing its dislocation A vertebra of this description when inverted resembles a table standing on four legs the two front legs being these conical spines and the two hind ones the upper oblique processes There is an arrangement in the Elephant tending to this but by no means so finished as the conical spine is much shorter and does not touch by a considerable space the vertebra above it The first six thoracic vertebrme have very long spinous processes that of the foremost measures twelve inches of the second thirteen and a half and of the third about the same they then diminish in length The lumbar vertebre sacrum and the caudal vertebrae are similar to those of the Elephant The sacro iliac junction is anchylosed PELVIS Its conformation presents the same type as in the Elephant but the measure ments are much more considerable The innominata join also from the top of the pubes to the anterior part of the tuber of isohia by a synchondrosis ar ticulation there is therefore no pubic arch as in the human subject The distance from the anterior superior spinous process to the centre of the sacrum is two feet nine inches From the same process to the posterior ex tremity of the symphysis of ischia ineasures three feet two inches44 DESCRIPTION OF AN ENTIRE HEAD From the superior extremity of the tuberosity of the ischium of one side to the corresponding point of the other one foot six inches Transverse diameter of sacrum at base eleven inches length one foot five and a half inches Anteroposterior diameter of pelvis at superior strait one foot six inches Transverse diameter of same strait one foot nine inches From anterior point of symphysis pubis to posterior of symphysis ischii one foot five inches From anterior superior spinous process of ilium to symphysis pubis two feet four inches From one anterior superior spinous process to the other four feet eight inches and little further back four feet ten inches for the extreme breadth of the pelvis From the middle of crista of ilium to inferior point of tuber of ischium three feet six inches Diameters of thyroid foramen eight and five inches Diameter of acetabulum six and a half inches RIBS The ribs resemble those of the Elephant their length appears to be the same but their size is greater in about the same proportion with the other bones The first rib measures in length nineteen and a half inches and has very dis tinct processes marking the insertion of the scalenus anticus and medius nmus cles and depressions also well marked for the subelavian artery and subcla vian vein The longest rib in the collection measures three feet seven inches along its outer convex edge EXTREMITIES The conformation of the bones of the anterior and posterior extremities is analagous to those of the Elephant but they are shorter thicker and more strongly marked by the muscles The os humeri is two feet five inches longtransverse diameter at condyles eight and a half inches and at upper end eleven inches Circumference just above insertion of deltoid two feet and at middle one foot four and a half inchesAND VARIOUS OTHER BONES OF THE MASTODON 45 Ulna length two feet one and a half inches circumference in middle one foot Radius one foot eleven inches long Lunare two and seveneighths of an inch thick Os femoris two feet eleven inches long circumference in middle one foot four inches diameter of head six and a half inches transverse diameter at condyles eight and a half inches Tibia one foot ten inches in length and eleven inches in circumference at middle Fibula one foot nine inches long SIZE OF THE MASTODON The following admeasurements of the bones of the extremities of the Mas todon and Elephant afford some data for determining the probable size of the former animal

standard of comparison belongs to a young Elephas Indicus and measures nine feet from the tips of the spinous processes of the first two dorsal vertebra to the ground But it has been seen that the ribs of the Mastodon are nearly of the same length as those of the Elephant and that the extremities are about six inches shorter in the forelegs and five inches in the hindlegs the greatest height of the ani mal described would consequently be short of nine feet at the shoulders  Cuvier limited the stature to twelve feet Oss Foss Vol II p 24 A portion of the head and some other bones of a Mastodon in Mr Kochs Museum at St Louis Missouri afford ground to think that the individual was about thirteen feet high See Bullet American Philosophical Society for 1840 paper by W E Homer M D Of the two existing species of Elephants the Elephas Africanus reaches a stature of from VIIIM46 DESCRIPTION OF AN ENTIRE HEAD The cervical vertebre of this Mastodon are from an eighth to a fifth thicker than they are in the Elephant The latter measures eleven feet from the anterior nares to the end of the ischia the Mastodon was probably twelve and a half feet in the same line Measurements and estimates thereon give in the Mastodon supposing the feet to be of the same vertical height as in the Elephant the following results Mastodon Elephant From tips of spinous processes of 1st and 2nd dorsal vertebrae to ground 8 feet 9 inches 9 feet From tip of spinous process of last lumbar ver tebra to ground 7 feet 10 inches 8 feet The Mastodon above described is inferior in the measurements of its several pieces to the one in the Philadelphia Museum the latter however in being articulated at a height of eleven and a half feet has probably transcended its natural limits at least eighteen inches its length also exceeds probably the proper bounds The thorax appears to be unnaturally expanded by the undue length of the costal cartilages the pelvis also by the keeping apart the sym physis of the pubes and ischia instead of joining it has an excess in its di ameter of from eight to ten inches The head is likewise thrown too much forward The probability is that the Mastodon carried his head with the front part almost vertical as the Elephant which would ease much the action of the muscles intended for its support In the collection of Mastodon bones previously in the cabinet of the Society there is a vertebra dentata eight and threefourths of an inch broad by eleven and a half in its anteroposterior diameter and an os calcis ten and a half inches long the animal of which these are the remains was probably from anD eighth to a tenth larger than the subject of this paper Whether the remains of the largest animals of this race have as yet been brought to light must continue for some eight to ten feet and the Elephas Indicus one of from eight to sixteen feet The Elephas Pri niogenus or Fossil Elephant also called Mammoth or Behemoth now extinct and whose re mains are so abundant in Siberia and the borders and islands of the Frozen Sea as to justify the expression that the ground is in places strewed with them appears to have been about or a little beyond the stature of the Indian Elephant Cuviers Oss Foss Ed 1812 p 135 vol IIAND VARIOUS OTHER BONES OF THE MASTODON 47 time a question among scientific men but the Committee are of opinion that ten or ten and a half feet was the greatest natural height of any one whose remains they have examined The committee cannot conclude this report without congratulating the So ciety on the possession of the entire head of this interesting animal The ac quisition is indeed a precious one not only from its being so far unique but as it furnishes mathrials for determining nearly all the doubtful points relative to the characters of the genus and for fixing its relations and position in the animal kingdom c All that is now wanting indeed to complete the history of the osteology of this animal is the discovery of a head with the tusks in situ so as to deter mine positively the direction of the latterwhether their convexity was up wards or downwards NOTE BY DR HAYS Read May 21 1841 SINCE the preceding paper was read to the Society I have seen the  Se cond annual Report on the Geological Survey of the State of Ohio by W W Mather principal Geologist and several assistants in which I find a brief notice of the bones which have just been described and some facts rela tive to their geological position of much interest and which I will therefore subjoin These bones according to Mr Briggs one of the assistants of Mr Mather were found in a bed of freshwatershell marl about four feet thick This marl is composed of argillaceous matter and freshwater shells among which were observed lymnmea planorbis physa and some species of cyclas and is covered by a layer of peat four feet thick These beds were deposited in a depression in a stratum of yellowish clay which forms the surface of the coun try and contains pebbles of primary and secondary rocks Beneath this is a stratum of bluish clay reposing on shale and limestone containing pebbles of primitive rocks and of the subjacent shale and waterworn limestone48 DESCRIPTION OF AN ENTIRE HEAD ETC OF THE MASTODON Wherever examined this clay seems to be destitute of organic remains The shale is part of the formation which extends from the Ohio river to Lake Erie The limestone is generally destitute of fossils The following sketch repre sents the geological structure of a portion of Crawford county and exhibits the position in which the bones were found cS b A limestone B shale C sandstone D blue clay E  t yellow clay a bed of freshwatershell marl in which the 13 bones were found b b Sandusky river crossing twice the  H  i above profile extending from east to west The freshwatershell marl being deposited in the yellowish clay is more recent than the latter and therefore as Mr Briggs observes the Mastodon has become extinct since the deposite of the materials upon the surface of which are our magnificent forests and beautiful prairies Thus confirming the opinion expressed by the committee as to the comparatively very recent period at which this animal became extinct It is proper to state also that a brief notice of these bones with a profile sketch of tlhe head was communicated to Professor Silliman by Mr J W Foster and have been published in the American Journal of Science and the Arts Vol XXXVI p 189Mae st o Join isq l iTha 2 FzstCer7TzaiVe7 Zfia JSecodZCerioowalze tibia Drawn by OscaarALawson On atonc yMSWeaver Iithof

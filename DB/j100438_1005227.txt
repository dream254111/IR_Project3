OTHER BONES OF THE MASTODON BY WILLIAM E HORNER M D AND ISAAC HAYS M D READ OCTOBER 2 1840 THE UNDERSIGNED A COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE SOCIETY JANUARY 3D 1840 TO REPORT A DESCRIPTIAN OF THE COLLECTION OF MASTODON BONES RECENTLY PRESENTED TO THE SOCIETY BY SOME OF ITS MEMBERS HAVE THE HONOUR TO SUBMIT THE FOLLOW ING ACCOUNT ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT OF MR D WOOD FROM WHOM THESE BONES WERE PURCHASED THEY WERE DISOOVERED TWO YEARS SINCE ABOUT SEVEN FEET BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND IN DIGGING A MILLRACE ON THE ESTATE OF ABRAHAM HALM THREEFOURTHS OF A MILE EAST OF BUCYRUS CRAWFORD COUNTY OHIO ON THE DIVIDING RIDGE BETWEEN THE SANDUSKY AND SCIOTA VALLEYS THIS RIDGE CONSISTING OF TABLE LAND IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS IN OHIO IS WELL CULTIVATED AND ABOUNDS IN NEVERFAILING SPRINGS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE SOURCES OF THE SANDUSKY AND SCIOTA RIVERS THE WATERS OF THE FORMER FLOW INTO LAKE ERIE BY A COURSE ALMOST DUE NORTH AND THOSE OF THE LATTER INTO THE OHIO BY A COURSE NEARLY DUE SOUTH THE SOIL IN WHICH THE BONES WERE BURIED IS ENTIRELY ALLUVIAL THE COLLECTION CONTAINS PORTIONS OF THE SKELETONS OF TWO ANIMALS ONE LARGER THAN THE OTHER THE BONES OF THE LARGER OF THESE ANIMALS ARE LIGHTER MORE WORN MORE DECOMPOSED AND LARGER IN THEIR SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS THAN THE OTHER AND ARE OF A DIFFERENT COLOUR ALL THESE BONES WERE SOLD AS COMMON TO ONE SKELETON BUT THAT THEY APPERTAINED TO DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS IS SUFFICIENTLY SUBSTANTIATED FROM WHAT IS ALLEGED AND MOREOVER BY SOME OF THE CARPAL BONES OF THE RIGHT SIDE BEING IN DUPLICATE WHETHER OR NOT ALL WERE REALLY EXHUMED FROM THE SAME SPOT CANNOT NOW BE ASCERTAINED BY THE COMMITTEE VIIIK38 DESCRIPTION OF AN ENTIRE HEAD THOUGH BOTH SKELETONS HAVE BEEN INHUMED THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE FOSSIL IZED THE FIRST SET HAS A MUCH LIGHTER SPECIFIC GRAVITY THAN CORRESPONDING RE CENT BONES WOULD HAVE AND THE SECOND SET HAS ABOUT THE SAME SPECIFIC GRAVITY AS THE LATTER OR PERHAPS A SOMEWHAT GREATER BUT YET WITH A FRESHNESS OF SUR FACE AND OF TEXTURE WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT EITHER NO VERY LONG INTERVAL COULD HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE DEATH OF THE ANIMAL OR THAT THE SOIL IN WHICH THEY WERE DEPOSITED

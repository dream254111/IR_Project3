stockholders of manufacturing corporations were exempted from the liability there imposed on corporations generally Held a corpora tion for the generation of electricity for distribution to the public is a manufacturing corporation within the meaning of the provision Vence dor Inv Co v Highland Canal  Power Co Minn 145 N W 611 The question whether a corporation for the generation of electricity is a manufacturing corporation under the various statutes and consti tutional provisions is one on which the authorities are not in accord Most of the older authorities and a number of the more recent cases hold that such a corporation is not a manufacturing corporation Fred erick Electric Light etc Co v Frederick 84 Md 599 36 Atl 362 WVil liams v Park 72 N H 305 56 Atl 463 In these cases the courts adhere to the earlier and more restricted definition of the word manufacturer holding that to be a manufac turer one must produce a fabric or structure made from materials of some kind In an early case it was said that on reason and principle a corporation for generating electricity should be held a manufacturing corporation but as the statute was meant to apply to those corporations which had in the past been considered as manufacturing corporations the court held that the electric light company could not take advantage of the exemption allowed to manufacturing corporations Commonwealth v Northern Electric Light Co 145 Pa St 105 22 Atl 839 But recently in the same state it has been settled that corporations for generating electricity are manufacturing corporations within the terms of such stat utes Commonwealth v Keystone Electiric etc Co 193 Pa St 245 44 Atl 326 Modern authority favors such a construction of the laws regulating manufacturing corporations as to include within their terms corpora tions for the production of electric currents People v Wemple 129 N Y 543 29 N E 808 Beggs v Edison Electric Co 96 Ala 295 11 So 381642 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Formerly

sun On examining the results at Toronto corresponding effects were found to occur when the upper or south end of the needle was considered and therefore in accordance with the hypothesis The examination of the observations made at Greenwich Washington Lake Athabasca Fort Simpson and St Petersburgh are considered as further adding confirmation By the aid of these observations the author restates his principles more minutely endeavouring to indi cate what difference changes in the inclination declination place of the sun land and sea c will produce Though the sun is the cause of those changes in the atmosphere which affect the lines of force of the earth he is not assumed as the centre of action as regards those lines that is considered to exist somewhere in tle atmosphere It appears to be in the upper re gions and not on the surface of the earth because it increases the dip of places north and south of the tropics which have a certain amount of inclination as at Hobarton and Torcnto both in summer and winter but it diminishes the dip at places which are within the tropics and with little inclination as St Helena By other kinds of observations it appears to be in advance of the sun All the pheno niena indicate that the sun does not act directly on the needles at different places but mediately through its effect on the atmosphere The author then considers the possible cause of numerous irregu lar variations such as those that are shown by the photographic pro cesses of record at Greenwich and Toronto The varying pressure of the atmosphere the occurrence of winds and large currents of air of rain and snow of the passage of those masses of warm and cold air which the meteorologist recognizes in the atmosphere of the aurora borealis he considers may all produce changes in the lines of mag netic force and become more or less sensible in the records of irregular variations The author thinks it very possible that masses of air at different temperatures may be moved by the magnetic force of the earth according to the principles of differential action made manifest in the experiments on warm and cold oxygen in which case material as well as potential magnetic storms may exist He concludes his paper by calling attention to the wonderful constitu tion of oxygen in its magnetical and electrical as well as its chemical relations to the offices it has to perform as part of the atmosphere 4  Experimental Researches in Electricity Atmospheric Mag netism continued Twentyseventh Series By Michael Faraday Esq DCL FRS c Received November 19 1850 In order to obtain an experimental representative of the action of the atmosphere when heated above or cooled below the average temperature the author employed a ring helix of covered copper wire through which an electric current was passed The helix was about one inch and a half in diameter and having the wellknown system of magnetic forces was placed with its magnetic axis parallel to a free needle when its position was such that a needle within the ring would point with the north end downward then the effect in deflecting the surrounding lines of force of the earth was considered1001 as like that of a relatively paramagnetic mass of air and when its position was reversed its action was representative of that of a heated or relatively diamagnetic mass of air Bringing this helix into the vicinity of small magnetic needles suspended either freely or so as to show declination or inclination the planes of action or indif ference as regards the power of deflecting the lines of force and the needle were observed When the needle can move only in one plane there are four quadrants formed in the case of the de clination needle by the intersection of the planes of the magnetic equator and meridian When in these planes there is no deflection at the needle but wlhen in the quadrants there is and in opposite directions in the neighbouring quadrants As the lines of force are held in and by the earth so these experi ments were repeated with a needle in near vicinity to a magnet and the difference of effect is pointed out then the extent to which these results are applicable to those of the earth is considered and their utility in guiding the inquirer The effect of heated air having been considered in the last paper that of cold air is now taken up and after considering its action in causing a contraction or drawing together of the terrestrial lines of magnetic force according to the principles of conduction before enunciated the author considers generally where the regions of cold which travel round the earth every twentyfour hours will be in the northern and southern hemispheres and how they will grow up and diminish in extent and importance as the sun moves north and south during the year After which he applies these considerations and the results of the experiments with the ring helix to the expli cation of the changes of the needle as they are given by observations at St Petersburgh Greenwich Hobarton Toronto Cape of Good Hope St Helena and Singapore In doing this he endeavours to explain the night action the early morning effect the contrary course of the needle for the same hours in different months the dif ference of local time dependent on the distribution of land and water the cumulative effect of preceding months and the con tinual effect especially in the tropical regions of the higher tempe rature of the northern hemisphere above that of the south In all these points the author sees such an agreement between the natural results and those which are suggested by the assumed physical cause of the magnetic variations as to give him a growing confidence in the truth of the views he has put forth November 30 1850 At the Anniversary Meeting The EARL OF ROSSE President in the Chair Mr Edward Solly on the part of the Auditors of the Treasurers Accounts reported that the total receipts during the past year in

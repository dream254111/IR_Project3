J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107811,ON MAGNETIC INFLUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS,I206981,219 XVI ON MAGNETIC INFLUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS BY SAMUEL HUNTER CHRISTIE ESQ M A F R S OF TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE FELLOW OF THE CAMBRIDGE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF THE ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY COMMUNICATED NOVEMBER 1I5 1825 READ JANUARY 1G 1826 1IHE OBJECT OF THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION IS TO SHOW BY A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS THAT THE SOLAR RAYS POSSESS SENSIBLE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES WHICH ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE VIBRATIONS OF A MAGNETISED NEEDLE EXPOSED TO THOSE RAYS INDEPENDENTLY OF THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE HEAT WHICH THEY IMPART I PROPOSE LIKEWISE TO POINT OUT THE CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE INTENSITY OF A MAGNETISED NEEDLE FROM CHANGES OF TEMO PERATURE AS DEDUCIBLE FROM THE TIMES OF ITS VIBRATION I HAVE BEFORE STATED IN MY PAPER ON THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON THE INTENSITY OF MAGNETIC FORCES THAT IN DEDUCING THE TERRESTRIAL MAGNETIC INTENSITY BY MEANS OF THE VIBRATIONS OF A NEEDLE A CORRECTION OUGHT TO BE INTRODUCED WHERE THE OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES I HAD NOT AT THE TIME MADE ANY EXPERIMENTS BY WHICH I COULD ASCERTAIN HOW FAR CHANGES IN THE TEMPERATURE OF A NEEDLE WOULD BE SENSIBLE IN THE TIME OF ITS VIBRATION  AND THE FIRST OBSERVATIONS WHICH I MADE WITH THIS VIEW BEING WITH A LIGHT NEEDLE DID NOT GIVE VERY DECIDED RESULTS THEY HOWEVER LED ME FIRST TO NOTICE THE VERY SINGULAR FACT THAT A MAGNETIC NEEDLE COMES TO REST NORE QUICKLY WHEN VIBRATED EXPOSED TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN THAN WHEN VIBRATED IN THE SHADE220 MR CHRISTIE ON MAGNETZIC IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE EFFECT WHICH CHANGES OF TEMPERA TURE HAVE ON THE TIMES OF VIBRATION OF A NEEDLE IT IS NECES SARY TO KNOW THE TEMPERATURE OF THE NEEDLE ITSELF DURING THE OBSERVATIONS AND I SAW NO BETTER MEANS OF ASCERTAINING THIS EVEN APPROXIMATELY THAN TO VIBRATE IT IN THE SHADE AND THEN EXPOSED TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN AND TO CONSIDER THE TEMPERA TURE OF THE NEEDLE TO BE THAT INDICATED BY A THERMOMETER NEAR TO IT ON MY FIRST DOING THIS I FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH I COULD EASILY MARK THE 5OTH VIBRATION WHEN THE NEEDLE WAS SHADED I COULD NOT DISTINGUISH BEYOND THE 4OTH WHEN IT WAS EXPOSED I AT THE SAME TIME FOUND THAT THE TIME OF VIBRA TION WAS SLIGHTLY DIMINISHED AT THE HIGHER TEMPERATURE INSTEAD OF BEING INCREASED AS I HAD REASON TO EXPECT AS HOWEVER THE NEEDLE WAS NOT VIBRATED IN THE SAME SPOT IN THE TWO CASES THE DIMINUTION IN THE TIME OF VIBRATION AND OF THE ARC WHEN IT WAS EXPOSED MIGHT BE INDEPENDENT OF THE CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE AND OF ANY INFLUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS TO AVOID ANY UNCERTAINTY ARISING FROM DIFFERENCE OF DISTURBING CAUSES IN TWO SITUATIONS I PLACED THE COMPASS OUT OF DOORS WITH A SCREEN COMPOSED INTIRELY OF WOOD SUPPORTED AT THE HEIGHT OF FOUR FEET ABOVE IT AND BY REMOVING WHICH THE RAYS OF THE SUN STRUCK DIRECTLY ON THE NEEDLE A THERMOMETER HAVING THE BULB NEAR TO THE COMPASSBOX INDICATED NEARLY THE TEMPERATURE OF THE NEEDLE WHEN THE SHUTTER WAS UP SO THAT THE NEEDLE VIBRATED IN THE SHADE I COULD VERY DIS TINCTLY NOTE THE I OOTH VIBRATION BUT WHEN IT WAS REMOVED AND THE NEEDLE VIBRATED EXPOSED TO THE SUNS RAYS I COULD NOT SO DISTINCTLY MARK THE 75TH I MADE USE OF A NEEDLE SIX INCHES LONG WEIGHING 4275 GRAINS AND CONTAINED IN A BRASS COMPASSBOX WITH A GLASS COVER THE NEEDLE WAS SUSPENDED BY A FINE HAIR AND COMMENCED VIBRATING SO FROM ZEROINFLUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS 221 NEEDLE EXPOSED FTME F EXTENT OF ARC OF VIBRA TO THE SUN OR THERMOMETER OF VIBRATIONS TION FROM ZERO BEING

436  4 45 FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALTHOUGH THE NEEDLE VIBRATED RATHER MORE RAPIDLY YET IT CAME MORE QUICKLY TO A STATE OF REST WHEN EXPOSED TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN THAN WHEN IN THE SHADE THE LATTER EFFECT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN PRODUCED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE HEAT OF THE RAYS SINCE WHEN THE THERMOMETER HAD RISEN ONLY TO 753 THE TERMINAL ARC HAD DECREASED FROM 5 TO 20 30 THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE BETWEEN NOON AND PH 3OM ON THE 4TH OF JUNE 1824 AND I HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF REPEATING THEM DURING THAT SUMMER AS THE APPARENT INCREASE OF INTENSITY AT AN INCREASED TEMO PERATURE INDICATED BY A SMALL DIMINUTION IN THE TIME OF VIBRA TION EXCITED MY SURPRISE AS MUCH AS THE MORE RAPID DECREASE OF THE ARCS OF VIBRATION WHEN THE NEEDLE WAS EXPOSED TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN I RESOLVED TO MAKE USE OF A BALANCE OF TORSION IN ORDER TO DEDUCE THE CHANGES OF INTENSITY FROM THE DEVIA TION CAUSED BY TORSION AS WELL AS FROM THE TIMES OF VIBRATION AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE LESS AMBIGUITY IN THE RESULTS I EM PLOYED A MUCH MORE POWERFUL NEEDLE ITS WEIGHT BEING 197 GRAINS AND LENGTH 6 INCHES AS BEFORE THIS NEEDLE WAS SUS PENDED BY A WIRE NO 22 229 INCHES LONG AND FREE FROM TORSION WHEN THE NEEDLE POINTED TO ZERO THE OBSERVATIONS MDCCCXVI G G222G MR CHRISTIE ON MAGNETIC CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE WERE MADE BETWEEN I AND 2 OCLOCK AFTER NOON ON THE SOTH OF MAY 1825 AS BEFORE THE

INTENSITY BE ESTIMATED BY THE TIME OF VIBRA TION OR BY THE DEVIATION CAUSED BY TORSION ESTIMATING IT BY THE LATTER WE SHALL HAVE SINCE THE DIRECTIVE FORCE VARIES DIRECTLY AS THE TORSION AND INVERSELY AS THE SINE OF THE DEVIATION DIRECTIVE FORCE AT TEMPERATURE 61 OUI49O 1047186 DIRECTIVE FORCE AT TEMPERATURE 820 340I73 1032624 SO THAT WITH AN INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE OF 21 THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A DECREASE OF INTENSITY OF 14552 THIS WOULD GIVE THE DECREMENT OF INTENSITY 00O67 FOR AN INCREMENT OF 10 IN TEMPERATURE BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURES 610 AND 820 THE INTENSITY AT 610 BEING CONSIDERED 1 FROM THE EXPERIMENTS WITH POWERFUL MAGNETS DETAILED IN MY FORMER PAPER PHIL TRANS 1825 P IT APPEARS THAT CONSIDERING THE INTEN SITY AT 620 AS 1 THE DECREMENT OF INTENSITY CORRESPONDING TOINFLUENCE ZN THE SOLAR RAYS 223 AN INCREMENT OF TEMPERATURE OF 10 BETWEEN 6205 AND 7765 WOULD BE OOO586 FROM WHICH THE FOREGOING RESULT DOES NOT DIFFER GREATLY IF WE ESTIMATE THE CHANGE OF INTENSITY BY THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TIMES OF VIBRATION CALLING THE INTENSITY AT THE TEMPERATURE 60 1 WE SHALL HAVE INTENSITY AT TEMPERATURE 8O 158 3  589 Z  992462 WE HAVE THEREFORE HERE A DECREASE OF INTENSITY 007538

DEDUCED FROM THE DEVIATION DUE TO TOR SION WHICH ARISES IN SOME MEASURE FROM THE ACCELERATION FROM TORSION BEING VERY NEARLY CONSTANT AT DIFFERENT TEMPERA TURES AND THEREFORE TENDING TO DIMINISH THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TIMES OF VIBRATION THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE BETWEEN IIL 3O0O AND 12H 40 M OF THE IOTH OF JUNE 1825 UNDER VERY FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SUN SHINING CLEAR AND STRONG

VIBRATION AT THESE TEMPERATURES BEING THE SAME WHERE BOTH WERE MADE IN THE SUN WE OBTAIN OOO64 AS THE DECREMENT THE INTENSITY AT THE LOWER TEMPERATURE BEING IN EACH CASE CONSIDERED AS 1 THE SMALL DISAGREEMENT IN THE FIRST TWO RESULTS MAY ARISE FROM ERRORS IN DETERMINING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE NEEDLE AT THE TIME OF VIBRATION WHICH FROM THE RAPID CHANGES THAT TOOKINFUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS 225 PLACE COULD NOT BE ASCERTAINED WITH PRECISION AND THE MUCH GREATER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EITHER OF THESE AND THE OTHER TWO MAY POSSIBLY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SAME SOURCE THOUGH I SHALL HAVE OCCASION AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS PAPER TO POINT OUT ANOTHER AND I CONCEIVE THE TRUE CAUSE OF THIS DIFFERENCE HAD MY OBJECT BEEN TO GIVE A CORRECTION FOR DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE TO BE APPLIED GERERALLY TO THE INTENSITIES DE DUCED FROM THE TIMES OF VIBRATION ACLOSER AGREEMENT IN THE RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE BUT ALTHO UGH SUCH IS NOT NY OBJECT I WISH FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS TO POINT OUT THE NECESSITY OF SUCH CORRECTION WHEN WE WOULD DEDUCE THE MAGNETIC INTENSITY FROM THE TIMES OF VIBRATION OF  A NEEDLE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH WHERE THE TEMPERATURES DURING THE OBSERVATIONS ARE NECESSARILY DIFFERENT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH I HAVE DETAILED ARE I THINK QUITE CONCLUSIVE AS ESTABLISHING THE FACT THAT THE RAYS OF THE SUN HAD A TENDENCY TO CHECK THE VIBRATION0S OF THE NEEDLE PARTI CULARLY THOSE IN THE LAST TABLE SINCE HERE ON THE NEEDLE BEING EXPOSED TO THE SUN THE TERMINAL ARC WAS REDUCED FROM NEARLY 1I4 TO 8 AND AGAIN ON EXCLUDING ITS RAYS THAT ARC WAS INCREASED TO NEARLY 1S THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS WOULD TAKE PLACE UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS WHE THER THE INFLUENCE BE EXERTED IN ALL CASES DIRECTLY ON A MAG NETISED NEEDLE AND INDEPENDENTLY OF CHANGES IN ITS TEMPERA TURE AND INTENSITY OR WHETHER IT WAS AN EFFECT PRODUCED ON THE METAL OF THE BOX BY A CHANGE IN ITS TEMPERATURE THAT THE EFFECT IS INDEPENDENT OF CHANGES IN THE TEMPERATURE AND INTENSITY OF THE NEEDLE WILL APPEAR FROM COMPARING ITHE FIRST OBSERVATION IN THE SUN WITH THE FIRST OF THE SECOND SET IN THE SHADE THE TEMPERATURES AND TIMES OF VIBRATION ARE VERY226 MR CHRISTIE ON MAGNETIC NEARLY THE SAME IN THE TWO CASES AND YET IN THE SUN THE TERMINAL ARC IS ONLY 80 WHEREAS IT IS 120 SO IN THE SHADE THAT THE DIMINUTION OF THE ARC DOES NOT ARISE FROM AN INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE IN THE BOX APPEARS FROM THIS THAT ALTHOUGH THE THERMOMETER INDICATED G9O AT THE FIRST OBSERVATION IN THE SUN AND 870 AT THE FIRST IN THE SHADE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BRASS COMPASSBOX WAS HIGHER IN THE LATTER CASE THAN IN THE FORMER SINCE IN BOTH THIS WOULD CHANGE ITS TEMPERATURE MORE SLOWLY THAN THE MERCURY IN THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER TO ASCERTAIN BEYOND DOUBT WHETHER THESE CONCLUSIONS WERE CORRECT I PLACED THE COMPASS IN A ROOM WHERE IT WAS NOT EXPOSED TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN AND WHEN THE NEEDLE HAD AC QUIRED THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM I VIBRATED IT AND NOTED THE TIME OF 40 VIBRATIONS AND THE ARC AT THE 4OTHS I THEN HEATED THE COMPASSBOX OVER A FIRE UNTIL ITS HEAT WAS BARELY SUPPORTABLE TO THE HAND REPLACED AND VIBRATED THE NEEDLE INSTEAD OF FINDING THAT THE INCREASED TEMPERATURE OF THE BOX HAD DIMINISHED THE TERMINAL ARC I FOUND THAT AT THE END OF THE FIRST 40 VIBRATIONS IT WAS CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN WHEN THE BOX HAD BEEN AT A LOWER TEMPERATURE AND THAT AS THE BOX HAD COOLED THE TERMINAL ARCS IN THE SUCCESSIVE 40 VIBRA TIONS DECREASED THE VIBRATIONS ALWAYS COMMENCING FROM GOO AND THIS EFFECT WAS INVARIABLY PRODUCED IN REPEATED TRIALS A THERMOMETER WAS PLACED AT A SMALL DISTANCE FROM THE COM PASS THAT ANY CHANGES IN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR MIGHT BE INDICATED THIS REMAINED NEARLY AT THE SAME POINT THROUGHOUT THE OBSERVATIONSINFLUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS 227

TEMPERATURE AND CON SEQUENT DIMINISHED INTENSITY OF THE NEEDLE HAD ANY TENDENCY TO DIMINISH THAT ARC IT WAS MUCH MORE THAN COUNTERBALANCED BY THE EFFECT PRODUCED ON THE COMPASSBOX THAT SUCH AN EFFECT SHOULD BE PRODUCED ON THE BRASS IS SINGULAR AND CAN I THINK ONLY BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE CAPACITY IN BRASS FOR THE DEVELOPEMENT OF MAGNETISM BY INDUCTION IS DIMINISHED BY AN INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE THE VIBRATIONS OF THE NEEDLE BEING IN ALL CASES CHECKED BY THE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED IN THE BRASS BY THE NEEDLE ITSELF  SINCE MAKING THE FOREGOING OBSERVATIONS I HAVE FOUND THAT A SIMILAR EFFECT ARISING I CONCEIVE FROM THE SAME CAUSE IS PRODUCED ON A COPPER DISC VIBRATING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MAGNET THE NUMBER OF VIBRATIONS REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE228 MR CHRISTIE ON MAGNETIC I NOW PROPOSED OBSERVING THE EFFECT ON THE TERMINAL ARC OF A CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE AND CONSEQUENTLY A CHANGE OF INTEN SITY IN THE NEEDLE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES REMAINING PRECISELY THE SAME FOR THIS PURPOSE I PLUNGED THE ENDS OF THE NEEDLE NEARLY TO ITS CENTRE INTO BOILING WATER AND VIBRATED IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTERWARDS ON MYR FIRST DOING THIS THE PIVOT ON WHICH THE NEEDLE VIBRATED WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED SO THAT BEING OBLIGED TO REMAGNETISE THE NEEDLE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN RESULTS PREVIOUS TO A DIMINUTION OF INTENSITY TO BE COMPARED WITH THOSE AFTER THE NEEDLE HAD BEEN IMMERSED THESE RESULTS COULD NOT BE COMPARED WITH THOSE WHICH I HAD BEFORE OBTAINED I MENTION THIS TO GUARD AGAINST ANY CONCLUSIONS BEING DRAWN FROM A COMPARISON OF THE TIMES OF VIBRATION OR OF THE TERMINAL ARCS IN THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS WITH THOSE OF THE PRECEDING IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INCREASED FRICTION ON THE PIVOT THE ARC OF VIBRATION WAS REDUCED TO 51 ON EACH SIDEOF ZERO AT THE SOTH VIBRATIONITHEREFORE ONLY OBSERVED THAT NUMBER THE VIBRATIONS COMMENCED AS BEFORE GOO FROM ZERO ARC OF VIBRATION TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WAS BY HEATING THE DISC INCREASED FROM BEING LESS THAN 23 TO Z6L TAKING A MEAN OF SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS THE METHOD OF VIBRAT ING METALLIC DISCS BETWEEN THE POLES OF A MAGNET WHICH I HERE MADE USE OF WAS I BELIEVE FIRST EMPLOYED BY MR WILLIAM STURGEON OF WOOLWICH FOR THE PURPOSE OF

A MEAN OF THE ARCS BEFORE IMMERSION AND AFTER IT WHEN THE NEEDLE HAD BEEN REMAGNETISED IT IS RATHER LESS THAN THE MEAN ARC WHEN THE INTENSITY OF THE NEEDLE WAS REDUCED BY AN INCREASED TEMPERATURE ARISING FROM THE IMMER SION SO THAT AN INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE WHICH DIMINISHED THE INTENSITY OF THE NEEDLE FROM X TO 092 PRODUCED NO SEN SIBLE EFFECT ON THE TERMINAL ARC THE DECREASE OF INTENSITY IS HERE MUCH GREATER THAN ANY THAT COULD ARISE FROM AN INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE DERIVED FROM THE DIRECT RAYS OF THE SUN IT IS THEREFORE MANIFEST FROM THESE LAST EXPERIM ENTS INDEPENDENT OF ANY THING WHICH I HAVE BEFORE STATED THAT THE HEAT OF THE SUN BY DIMINISHING THE INTENSITY COULD NOT BE THE CAUSE OF MDCCCXXVI H H250 MR CHRISTIE ON MAGNETIC THE DIMINUTION OF THE TERMINAL ARC THAT THIS DIMINUTION COULD NOT ARISE FROM THE INCREASED TEMPERATURE OF THE COM PASSBOX THE PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS HAVE I TRUST SATISFACTORILY PROVED I THINK I MAY THEREFORE SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT DURING THE VIBRATION OF A MAGNETISED NEEDLE EXPOSED TO THE SOLAR RAYS THESE RAYS HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE NEEDLE INDEPENDENT OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY HEAT WHICH TENDS TO BRING THE NEEDLE TO A STATE OF REST IN THE FIRST OBSERVATIONS WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED IT APPEARS THAT ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT EXPECT THAT WHEN THE NEEDLE VIBRATED IN THE SUN THE INCREASED TEMPERATURE WOULD DIMI NISH THE INTENSITY YET A SLIGHT ACCELERATION TOOK PLACE IN THE TIME OF VIBRATION WHETHER THIS IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE SAME CAUSE OR NOT IT IS PERFECTLY ANALOGOUS TO WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED ON VIBRATING A METALLIC DISC UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MAGNET THE ARC OF VIBRATION WAS MUCH MORE RAPIDLY DIMI NISHED THAN WHEN THE DISC VIBRATED UNINFLUENCED BY THE MAGNET AND THE TIMES OF VIBRATION WERE ALSO DIMINISHED A COPPER DISC 7 INCHES IN DIAMETER HAVING ITS AXIS OF SUSPEN SION PERPENDICULAR TO ITS PLANE AND AT A SMALL DISTANCE FROM ITS CENTRE MADE 86 VIBRATIONS BEFORE THE ARC OF VIBRATION WAS REDUCED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT  BUT ON VIBRATING IT BETWEEN THE POLES OF A HORSESHOE MAGNET IT MADE ONLY 3 VIBRATIONS BEFORE THE ARC WAS REDUCED TO THE SAME EXTENT THE TIMES IN WHICH THE DISC PERFORMED 294 VIBRATIONS AT DIFFERENT TRIALS WERE BETWEEN THE POLES OF FREELY THE MAGNET Z4 VIBRATIONS IN 3515 SECONDS E V 346 SECONDS 24      351 S 347 24351    E3 1 346 24       3518      346 TIME OF I VIBRATION   I4635  1  4427INFLUENCE ZEN THE SOLAR RAYS 231 SO THAT ANOTHER EFFECTOF THE MAGNET WAS TO DIMINISH THE TIME OF VIBRATION OF THE DISC IF THE ACCELERATION IN THE TIME OF VIBRATION OF THE NEEDLE WHEN EXPOSED TO THE SUNS RAYS ARISE FROMN A SIMILAR CAUSE WE OUGHT ALSO TO FIND THAT THE DECRE MNENT OF INTENSITY IN THE NEEDLE CORRESPONDING TO AN INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE AS DEDUCED FROM THE TIMES OF VIBRATION IN THE SUN AND IN THE SHADE IS LESS THAN THE DECREMENT DEDUCED FROM THE TIMES OF VIBRATION AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES WHEN BOTH OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE IN THE SHADE OR BOTH IN THE SUN AND LIKEWISE LESS THAN THAT DEDUCED FROM THE DEVIATION DUE TO TORSION AND THIS FROM THE OBSERVATIONSAPPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DECIDEDLYTHE CASE PROBABLY HOWEVER THE ACCES LERATIONS IN THE TIMES OF VIBRATION ARE ONLY CONSEQUENCES OF THE DIMINUTION OF THE ARCS BOTH IN THE CASE OF THE COPPER DISC AND OF THE NEEDLE VIBRATING IN THE SUN STILL THIS ACCELE RATION WILL ACCOUNT FOR THESE DIFFERENCES IN THE DECREMENTS OF INTENSITY ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD NOT AT PRESENT BE ABLE TO POINT OUT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE RAYS OF THE SUN TEND TO BRING THE NEEDLE TO REST THE DISCOVERY OF A FACT PROVING MAGNETIC INFLU ENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS MUST I THINK ULTIMATELY LEAD TO IMPOR TANT CONCLUSIONS RESPECTING THE PHENOMENA OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM ON THIS ACCOUNT IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE MODE OF OBSERVING SHOULD BE VARIED AND THAT OBSERVATIONS SHOULD BE MADE IN CLIMATES MORE FAVOURABLE FOR THE PURPOSE THAN OUR OWN I REGRET THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF MY ABSENCE FROM HOME I COULD NOT REPEAT THE EXPERIMENTS DURING THE EX TREMELY HOT AND CLEAR WEATHER OF THE PAST SUMMER AS IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE EFFECTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE DECIDED THAN THOSE WHICH I HAVE DETAILED POSSIBLY THE EFFECT MIGHTMR CHRISTNR ON AGNET4 BE GREATLY INCREASED BY PLACING THE NEEDLE SO NEARLY I THE FOCUS OF A LARGE LENS OR REFLECTOR THAT THE RAYS SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED ON THE SPACE IN WHICH THE NEEDLE VIBRATED IN THIS CASE HOWEVER THE INTENSITY OF THE NEEDLE MIGHT BE SO MUCH DIMINISHED BY THE HIGH TEMPERATURE AS TO RENDER DOUBTFUL THE CAUSE OF THE EFFECT OBSERVED THE REPEATED FAILURES OF MORICHRNIS EXPERIMENT OF MAG NETISING A NEEDLE BY THE VIOLET RAY EVEN UNDER THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN THE ABLEST HANDS HAVE LED MANY TO DOUBT WHETHER THE EFFECTS WHICH WERE IN SOME CASES OBSERVED WERE TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE RAY BUT AS THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE DETAILED INDICATE MAG NETIC INFLUENCE IN THE COMPOUND SOLAR RAYS AND ARE BESIDES EASILY REPEATED THEY WILL I THINK TEND CONSIDERABLY TO REMOVE THESE DOUBTS ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY NOVEMBER X5 I8ZS ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS SINCE THE FOREGOING PAPER WAS READ HAVING MADE SOME FURTHER OBSERVATIONS WHICH SHOW MORE DECIDEDLY THAN THE PRECEDING THAT THE EFFECT WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED IS DUE TO MAGNETIC INFLUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS I BEG HERE TO ADD THEM I WAS SATISFIED THAT THE DECREASE IN THE TERMINAL ARC WHEN THE NEEDLE VIBRATED IN THE SUN COULD NOT BE DUE TO THE IN CREASED TEMPERATURE OF THE METALLIC COMPASSBOX IN WHICH THE NEEDLE VIBRATED SINCE IN THE EXPERIMENT WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AND WHICH I HAVE CAREFULLY REPEATED THE EFFECTNFENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS 233 PRODUCED BY HEATING THE BOX WAS TO INCREASE CONSIDERABLY THAT ARC YET I CONSIDERED THAT IT MUST REMOVE ALL DOUBT ON THE SUBJECT IF THE BOX IN WHICH THE NEEDLE VIBRATED WERE OF WOOD OR OTHER NONMETALLIC SUBSTANCE I RESOLVED THEREFORE AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY TO REPEAT MY EXPERIMENTS AND TO MAKE ADDITIONAL ONES WITH AN APPARATUS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF WHICH I HAD SCRUPULOUSLY EXCLUDED METAL THE SUSPENSION OF THE NEEDLE ALONE EXCEPTED THE COMPASSBOX IS OF MAHO GANY THE SIDES BEING OF THICK PASTEBOARD THE GRADUATIONS ARE ON PAPER THROUGH A PERFORATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GLASS COVER A GLASS TUBE IS FIXED AND DOWN THIS THE SUSPEND ING WIRE WHICH IS FIXED ABOVE PASSES INTO THE COMPASS BOX THE NEEDLE CAN BE RELEASED 90 FROM ZERO BY MEANS OF A WOODEN OR GLASS PIN TURNING IN THE SIDE OF THE BOX IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DESIRABLE TO HAVE REPEATED THE EXPERIT MENTS IN A VACUUM AS THE EFFECT WHICH I HAD OBSERVED TO BE PRODUCED BY VIBRATING THE NEEDLE EXPOSED TO THE SUN MIGHT POSSIBLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN THE MEDIUM IN WHICH THE NEEDLE MOVED BUT AS THERE WOULD BE EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN DOING THIS WITHOUT HAVING METAL IN THE VICINITY OF THE NEEDLE I PROPOSED TO VIBRATE NEEDLES OF COPPER AND OF GLASS BY THE FORCE OF TORSION BOTH IN THE SHADE AND EXPOSED TO THE SUN TO OBSERVE THE TERMINAL ARCS UNDER THOSE CIRCUM STANCES AND TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS WITH THOSE OBTAINED WITH A MAGNETISED NEEDLE THE NEEDLES EMPLOYED ARE ALL OF THE SAME FORM THEIR LENGTH 6 INCHES BREADTH IN THE MIDDLE I5 INCHES THEIR SIDES BEING NEARLY CIRCULAR ARCS THE MAGNET ISED NEEDLE WAS SUSPENDED BY A VERY FINE HARD BRASS WIRE NO 35 BETWEEN 300 AND 4 INCH INI DIAMETER AND O INCHES IN LENGTH THE GLASS NEEDLE WAS SUSPENDED BY THE SAME284 MR CHRISTIE ONF MAGNETIC LENGTH OF NO 18 AND THE COPPER NEEDLE BY THE SAME LENGTH OF THIS WIRE DOUBLED IN VIBRATING THESE NEEDLES THEY WERE RELEASED GO9 FROM ZERO AND IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN THAT TIE EXTENT OF THE FIRST VIBRATION WAS THE SAME WHEN THE NEEDLE VIBRATED IN

MINFUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS 235 IN WHATEVER WAY WE MAY ATTEMPT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE TER MINAL ARC OF VIBRATION WHEN A NEEDLE IS SCREENED FROM THE SUN EXCEEDING THAT WHEN IT VIBRATES EXPOSED TO THE RAYS WHICH EXCESS I HAVE CALLED THE TERMINAL EXCESS THE RESULT HERE OBTAINED WITH THE GLASS NEEDLE IS CERTAINLY EXTRAORDINARY AS COMPARED WITH THAT OBTAINED WITH THE MAGNETISED NEEDLE IT SHOWS DECIDEDLY THAT THE SOLAR RAYS EXERT A PECULIAR INFLU ENCE ON A MAGNETISED NEEDLE DURING ITS VIBRATION CONSIDERED SEPARATELY EITHER THAT GLASS IS MAGNETIC WHICH IS SCARCELY PROBABLE SINCE ITS MAGNETISM IS NOT DETECTED BY ROTATING A MAGNET UNDER IT OR THAT THE RAYS PRODUCE AN EFFECT DISTINCT AND INDEPENDENT OF THEIR MAGNETICAL EFFECT THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE CONSECUTIVELY WITHOUT EVEN MOVING THE COMPASSBOX  BUT IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE ESPECI ALLY AT THE PRESENT SEASON OF THE YEAR TO MAKE SUCH A SERIES UNDER PRECISELY THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES OF TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR AND OF SOLAR HEAT BY WHICH ALONE WE CAN IN THIS CASE JUDGE OF THE INTENSITY OF THE ACTION OF THE SUN THE CHANGE WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING THE OBSERVATIONS WAS PROBABLY NOT QUITE SO GREAT AS I HAVE REGISTERED SINCE IN THE FIRST OBSERVA TION WITH THE MAGNETISED NEEDLE THE GLASS HAD BEEN CLOSED OVER THE THERMOMETER FOR SOME TIME BEFORE I REGISTERED ITS HEIGHT AND IN THE FIRST OBSERVATIONS WITH THE OTHER NEEDLES IT HAD BEEN OPEN AND IN THE SHADE FOR THE PRECEDING OBSERVA TIONS UNTIL VERY NEARLY THAT TIME SO THAT 10099 AND 98 WOULD PROBABLY INDICATE MORE CORRECTLY THE COMPARATIVE ELE VATIONS OF THE THERMOMETER IN THE FIRST OBSERVATIONS WITH THE DIFFERENT NEEDLES THAN 0OO96 AND 92 WHICH I HAVE REGIS TERED BUT EVEN TAKING THE LATTER THE SMALL DIFFERENCE 5 WOULD PRODUCE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULTS AND IS MUCH236 MR CHRISTIE ON MAGNETIC MORE THAN COUNTERBALANCED BY THE TIME DURING WHICH THE GLASS AND COPPER NEEDLES VIBRATED BEING GREATER THAN THAT FOR THE MAGNETISED NEEDLE IF THE EFFECTS BE REDUCED PROPOR TIONALLY TO THE TIMES THE TERMINAL EXCESS IN THE SAME TIME WOULD BE FOR THE MAGNETISED NEEDLE 13075 FOR THE COPPER NEEDLE 5024 AND FOR THE GLASS NEEDLE 4071 THE DIMINUTION IN THE TIME OF VIBRATION OF THE MAGNETISED NEEDLE WHEN EXPOSED TO THE SUN MAY AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR SINGULAR SINCE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE TEMPERATURE BEING HIGHER THE INTENSITY OF THE NEEDLE WAS LESS THAN WHEN IT WAS SCREENED THIS DIMINUTION IN THE TIME OF VIBRATION I HAVE NO DOUBT AROSE PRINCIPALLY FROM THE MORE RAPID DIMINU TION OF THE ARCS OF VIBRATION IN THE FORMER CASE THAN IN THE LATTER AND LIKEWISE IN SOME MEASURE FROM THE NEEDLE NOT RE COVERING THE SAME INTENSITY OF MAGNETISM AFTER BEING EXPOSED TO THE HIGH TEMPERATURE OF THE SUNS RAYS WHICH IT PREVIOUSLY POSSESSED THAT THESE CAUSES OPERATED TO A GREAT EXTENT IS CLEARLY SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS WHICH I AFTER WARDS MADE THE SAME NEEDLE BUT BAVING ITS WEIGHT INCREASED TO 252 GRAINS WAS FIRST VIBRATED IN THE SHADE FRONT 0OO AS BEFORE AND THREE DIFFERENT OBSERVATIONS GAVE ME 5N 58S8 M 586 5M 58S6 AS THE TIME OF PERFORMING IOO VIBRATIONS OR 3K5587 AS THE MEAN TIME OF I VIBRATION THE TERMINAL ARC BEING 3 AND THERMOMETER 645 I THEN VIBRATED IT STILL IN THE SHADE FROM GO2 AND FOUND THAT 5O VIBRATIONS WERE PERFORMED IN 9M 48S8 GIVING SS376 AS THE MEAN TIME OF VIBRATION THE TERMINAL ARC BEING 1I AND THERMOMETER 650 SIMILAR OBSERVATIONS BEING IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS MADE WITH THE NEEDLE EXPOSED TO THE SUN GAVE 5M 59G4 45M 59S4 AND 6M OOS AS THE TIME OF PERFORMING ILOO VIBRATIONS ORINFLUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS 237 SS596 AS THE MEAN TIME OF ONE VIBRATION WHEN THE NEEDLE VIBRATED FROM GO THE TERMINAL ARC BEING I G AND THERMO METER LOSES AND VIBRATED FROM 2O0 THE TIME OF PERFORMING SO VIBRATIONS WAS 2 622 OR THE MEAN TIME OF ONE VIBRATION 3445 THE TERMINAL ARC BEING 9 AND THERMOMETER IIO THE INTENSITIES IN THE SHADE AND IN THE SUN ESTIMATED BY THE TIMES OF VIBRATION IN THE LARGE ARCS WOULD BE I AND 995 BUT ESTI MATED BY THE TIMES OF VIBRATION IN THE SMALL ARCS T AND 96O IT APPEARS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS THAT IN DEDUCING THE MAGNETIC INTENSITY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH FROM THE VIBRATIONS OF A NEEDLE IT IS VERY ESSENTIAL TO ATTEND TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE NEEDLE HAVING BEEN EXPOSED OR NOT TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN DURING ITS VIBRATION AS WELL AS TO THE TEMPER ATURE IN WHICH THE VIBRATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE THE VERY SMALL INCREASE IN THE TIMES OF VIBRATION OF THE GLASS AND COPPER NEEDLES WHEN EXPOSED TO THE SUN ABOVE THOSE WHEN SCREENED IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHT EXPAN SION OF THE NEEDLES THEMSELVES AND PERHAPS OF THE SUSPEND ING WIRES BUT THIS IS TOO SMALL AT ALL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE TER MINAL EXCESS WITH THESE NEEDLES I AM AWARE THAT HAD THE COPPER NEEDLE BEEN OF THE SAME WEIGHT AS THE MAGNETISED NEEDLE AND THE TIMES OF VIBRATION OF ALL THE NEEDLES MORE NEARLY THE SAME IN THE SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE GIVEN THE RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE STRICTLY COMPARA TIVE BUT ON THE ONLY DAY DURING WHICH TO THE PRESENT TIME THE SUN HAS CONTINUED UNCLOUDED LONG ENOUGH FOR MAKING A COMPLETE SERIES WITH DIFFERENT NEEDLES I WAS UNPROVIDED WITH ANY LIGHTER COPPER AND SINCE I HAVE FORMED NEEDLES OF MAGNETISED AND UNMAGNETISED SHEETS OF COPPER AND OF GLASS ALL OF THE SAME FORM AND WEIGHT AND ADJUSTED THE SUSPENDING MDCCCXXVI I28 MR CHRISTIE ON MAGNETIC WIRE SO THAT THEY SHALL VIBRATE IN THE SAME TIME I HAVE IN VAIN MADE ALMOST DAILY ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN A COMPLETE SET OF OBSERVATIONS THE OBSERVATIONS HOWEVER WHICH I HAVE GIVEN ARE I THINK QUITE CONCLUSIVE AS TO THE FACT OF THE COMPOUND SOLAR RAYS BEING POSSESSED OF MAGNETIC PROPERTIES AS WE CAN SCARCELY SUPPOSE THAT THE TERMINAL EXCESS IN THE CASE OF THE GLASS NEEDLE IS DUE TO MAGNETISM IN THE GLASS DEDUCTING THIS PORTION FROM THE TERMINAL EXCESS WITH THE OTHER NEEDLES THE RATIO OF THIS EXCESS WITH THE MAGNETISED NEEDLE TO THAT WITH THE COPPER NEEDLE WOULD BE 17 TO I A RESULT NOT VERY IMPROBABLE THOUGH THE SMALL DIFFERENCE IN THIS EXCESS WITH THE COPPER AND GLASS NEEDLES MAY VERY POS SIBLY HAVE ARISEN FROM OTHER CAUSES BUT IF THE EFFECT WITH THE GLASS NEEDLE CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO MAGNETIC INFLUENCE ANY HOW EXERTED WHAT CAUSE ARE WE TO ASSIGN FOR IT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE TERMINAL EXCESS IN THIS CASE MAY HAVE ARISEN FROM CURRENTS OF AIR EXCITED WITHIN THE BOX BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN OR PROBABLY ELECTRICITY IS EXCITED IN THE GLASS NEEDLE ON EXPOSURE TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN AND THE BOX BECOMING ELECTRIC BY INDUCTION A DRAG BETWEEN THE NEEDLE AND THE BOX CAUSES A DIMINUTION IN THE ARC OF VIBRATION THE LATTER SUP POSITION WOULD ACCORD WITH THE RECENT HIGHLY INTERESTING EX PERIMENTS OF MR BABBAGE I AM NOT AWARE THAT SUCH EFFECTS AS THESE HAVE EVER BEFORE BEEN OBSERVED DURING VIBRATION AND THERE CERTAINLY APPEARS GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ASSIGNING ANY CAUSE FOR THEM HOWEVER UNTIL FURTHER OBSERVATIONS MAY HAVE THROWN GREATER LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT WE MUST BE SATIS FIED WITH HAVING ASCERTAINED THE FACTS I HAVE NOT AS YET MADE ANY OBSERVATIONS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT MAY BE THE EFFECTS WHEN A NEEDLE VIBRATES EXPOSED TO THEINFLUENCE IN THE SOLAR RAYS 239 SEPARATED RAYS BUT HAVING AN APPARATUS FOR THE PURPOSE I PROPOSE DOING SO WHEN THE SEASON BECOMES MORE FAVOURABLE FOR SUCH EXPERIMENTS THAN IT IS AT PRESENT ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY ZOTH APRIL I826

J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1101815,CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS,I245987,CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS IN BELLS V GILLESPIE 5 RAND 299 JUDGE COALTER SAID I ONCE HEARD OF A SCOTCHMAN WHO HAVING ACQUIRED A GOOD DEAL OF PROPERTY HAD OCCASION TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT BEFORE DOING SO MADE HIS WILL NOT BEING HEARD OF FOR A LONG TIME PROBATE WAS TAKEN OF THE WILL SUPPOSING HIM TO BE DEAD AFTER SOME FIFTY YEARS A SUIT DEPENDING ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE WILL WAS ARGUED AND ABOUT TO BE DECIDED AN AGED STRANGER ATTENDED THE ARGUMENT AND DECISION AFTER WHICH HE AROSE AND TOLD THE COURT THAT WHATEVER THEY MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY WHEN HE WROTE AND MADE THAT WILL HE INTENDED SO AND SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE COURT HAD DECIDED COULD ALL THE TESTATORS SINCE THE ACT OF 1776 THUS APPEAR BEFORE US WE WOULD HARDLY BELIEVE THIS ASSEMBLED HOST FROM THE DEAD IN HOW MANY INSTANCES THEIR WILLS HAD BEEN VIOLATED THIS WAS ONE OF THE MANY CASES IN OUR COURT BEGINNING WITH THE WELLKNOWN CASE OF CARTER V TYLER 1 CALL 143 IN WHICH THE WELLSETTLED RULE OF REAL PROPERTY WAS SO OFTEN ANNOUNCED THAT A CONTINGENT LIMITATION IN A WILL OR DEED DEPENDING UPON A PERSON DYING WITHOUT HEIRS HEIRS OF THE BODY ISSUE ISSUE OF THE BODY CREATED AN ESTATE TAIL ENLARGED BY THE STATUTE INTO A FEE AND THAT ANY EXECUTORY DEVISE LIMITED AFTER SUCH ESTATE WAS VOID PRIOR TO THE ACT OF 1819 BECAUSE THESE WORDS BEFORE THAT STATUTE WAS PASSED WERE CONSTRUED TO MEAN AN INDEFINITE FAILURE OF ISSUE JUDGE CARR CLAIMED THAT THE ACT OF 1819 PROVIDING THAT IN A WILL OR DEED HEREAFTER MADE A CONTINGENT LIMITATION DEPENDENT UPON THE DYING OF A PERSON WITHOUT HEIRS HEIRS OF THE BODY ISSUE ISSUE OF THE BODY ETC SHALL BE HELD TO TAKE EFFECT WHEN SUCH PERSON SHALL DIE WITHOUT HEIR ISSUE ETC LIVING AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH OR BORN WITHIN TEN MONTHS WAS NOT INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS A CENSURE BUT THAT IT WAS MERELY ACKNOWLEDGING THE EXISTING LAW TO BE AS SETTLED BY THE COURTS MEANING MERELY TO CHANGE IT FOR THE FUTURE BUT WHATEVER THIS LEARNED JUDGE MAY THINK WAS INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PASSAGE OF THIS ACT IT CERTAINLY APPEARS TO BE A DECIDED REBUKE TO THIS PARTICULAR CANON OF CONSTRUCTION THERETOFORE GIVEN BY THE COURTS TO WILLS OF TESTATORS HAD THE LEGISLATURE NOT THOUGHT THAT THIS RULE OF 19091 58715 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER CONSTRUCTION IN MOST INSTANCES TENDED TO DEFEAT THE WILL OF THE TESTATOR WHY WE ASK SHOULD SUCH A STATUTE EVER HAVE BEEN PASSED BECAUSE THE RULE OF CONSTRUCTION STILL REMAINS WITH ALL ITS FORMER FORCE AND EFFECT THAT THE INTENTION OF THE TESTATOR IS THE POLAR STAR BUT IN SPITE OF THIS ATTEMPTED DEFENSE BY THE COURT THE FOLLOW ING SERVES TO SHOW HOW COMPLETELY THEY WERE TIED DOWN TO THIS RULE OF CONSTRUCTION AND THAT THEY FELT THEMSELVES BOUND TO FOLLOW IT SLAVISHLY NO MATTER WHAT THE ACTUAL INTENTION OF THE TESTATOR WAS AND INDEED THIS IS STILL THE RULE OF CONSTRUCTION THE TRUE ENQUIRY BEING NOT WHAT THE TESTATOR MEANT TO EXPRESS BUT WHAT THE WORDS HE HAS USED DO EXPRESS SUPPOSE A TESTATOR SHOULD PREFACE HIS WILL BY STATING THAT HE WAS WITHOUT COUNSEL AND UNACQUAINTED WITH THE TECHNICALITIES OF LAW AND OF COURTS BUT THAT HE KNEW HE COULD NOT CREATE AN ESTATE TAIL AND ALSO THAT A FEE WOULD PASS IF HE DID SO AND HE WOULD BE THEREBY DEFEATED IN CERTAIN PROVISIONS WHICH HE WISHED TO MAKE FOR HIS CHILDREN AND THEIR DESCENDANTS FOR FAMILY PUR POSES AND TO KEEP THE ESTATE IN HIS FAMILY AS LONG AS HE COULD WITHOUT THE VIOLATION OF ANY LAW AND THEREFORE HOPED THAT HIS WILL MIGHT BE FAIRLY CONSTRUED AND SUPPORTED UNLESS IT PLAINLY APPEARS THAT HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO CREATE AN ESTATE WHICH THE LAW DID NOT AUTHORIZE AND A WILL SUCH AS THE PRESENT AND SUCH AS THIS COURT IS IN THE HABIT OF DECIDING ON SO PREFACED WAS SUB MITTED TO US TO DECIDE WHAT MEANING WAS TO BE PUT ON IT COULD ANY OTHER BE PUT ON IT THAN SUCH AS THE ACT OF ASSEMBLY OF 1819 AFORESAID HAS PRESCRIBED BUT IS NOT THIS IN FACT THE APPEAL WHICH EVERY TESATOR SINCE THE ACT OF 1776 WAS GENERALLY KNOWN TO BE IN FORCE MAKES TO THIS COURT THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE FROM THE COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW WE RE GARD AS VERY TIMELY AND WE PUBLISH IT NOT AS A REBUKE TO OUR COURTS BUT SIMPLY TO SHOW THE MODERN TREND OF THE JUDICIAL MIND IN THEIR EFFORT TO ARRIVE AT THE POLAR STAR DOES THE COURT EVER WRITE A WILL FOR THE TESTATOR A RECENT TEXTBOOK ON WILLS SAYS AND THE REMARK HAS A FAMILIAR SOUND IN CONSTRUING A WILL THE COURT HAS NO INTENTION TO MAKE A WILL DEC 588CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS FOR THE TESTATOR OR TO ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE UPON THE WILL WHICH THE TESTATOR ACTUALLY MADE OCCASIONALLY ONE COMES ACROSS AN OPINION WHERE THE LEARNED JUSTICE ASSEVERATES THAT THE COURT CANNOT SUSTAIN AN INTERPRETA TION ASKED FOR BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD BE NOT TO CONSTRUE THE WILL BUT TO WRITE ONEAND THIS THE COURT CANNOT DO LAWYERS ARE AWARE THAT NO SUCH POWER DWELLS IN ANY COURT BUT AFTER ALL IS IT ABSOLUTELY CORRECT TO DECLARE OF COURTS THAT THEY ARE NEVER GUILTY OF DOING THIS VERY THING OUR PURPOSE IN THE PRESENT ARTICLE IS TO SET ON FOOT AN ENQUIRY AS TO WHETHER JUDGES ENGAGED IN THE TASK OF CONSTRUING A TESTA TORS LANGUAGE DO NOT ACTUALLY WORK OUT IN SOME INSTANCES A RESULT WHICH AMOUNTS TO LITTLE ELSE THAN GIVING EFFICACY TO THE COURTS OWN IDEA OF WHAT THE TESTATOR PROBABLY WOULD APPROVE ALTHOUGH AS A MATTER OF FACT SUCH IS NOT HIS WILL WE DO NOT MEAN TO ASK IF A COURT EVEN OF THE HIGHEST REPUTATION DOES NOT AT TIMES FALL INTO ERROR WE ARE SEEKING TO DISCOVER WHETHER IT BE NOT A FACT THAT JUDGES NOT INFREQUENTLY HAVE SUBSTITUTED THEIR OWN CONCEPTION IN PLACE OF THAT WHICH THE TESTATOR MUST HAVE ENTERTAINED SO THAT TO ALL INTENT AND PURPOSE THEY ARE WRITING A WILL FOR HIM WE DO NOT WISH TO INTIMATEWE TAKE LEAVE TO PROTESTTHAT ANY JUDGE EVER AVOWEDLY DOES SO WHAT WE DO OBSERVE IS THAT DURING THE PROCESS OF GETTING AT THE INTENTION OF A TESTATOR THE JUDICIAL EXAMINER IS SEEN AT TIMES TO DRIFT AWAY FROM WHAT THE TESTATOR HAS WRITTEN WIGMORE CALLS ATTENTION TO A REMARK OF DALLAS C J IN POCOCK V LINCOLN2 TO THE EFFECT THAT IF NOT IN A MAJORITY OF WILLS YET CERTAINLY IN A GREAT NUM BER THE CONSTRUCTION IS CONTRARY TO THE PROBABLE INTENT3 IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN THAT WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO STATE IS SET DOWN IN NO SPIRIT OF ANIMADVERSION WE HAVE NO PAR TICULAR COURT AND NO SPECIAL CASE IN MIND WE ARE MERELY IN DULGING IN A LITTLE SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER THE PROFESSION REAL IZES THAT THE COURTS DO AS A MATTER OF FACT NOW AND THEN WRITE A WILL ALTHOUGH THEY TAKE PAINS TO ASSURE US THAT THEY HAVE NEITHER THE POWER NOR THE WISH SO TO DO A CONCISE

REVEAL HAPPENING OF LATE TO BE INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT OF THE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF WILLS WE FELL TO CONTEMPLATING THE ENVIRONMENT UNDER WHICH A COURT OF LAST RESORT COMMONLY PROCEEDS IN ORDER TO SETTLE A DISPUTE ARISING OVER THE MEANING OF WORDS EMPLOYED BY A TESTATOR INASMUCH AS THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH HAS NOT AS YET MADE IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN AN EXPLANATION FROM THE TESTATOR HIMSELF PARTIES OF ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS WHO CONCEIVE THEMSELVES ENTITLED TO SHARE IN THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED ARE STILL COMPELLED TO ASK THE COURT TO TELL THEM WHAT THE SOUND AND DISPOSING MIND WAS THINKING OF WHEN IT PUT ON PAPER THE TERMS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ON A CONTROVERSY THE TESTATOR LET IT BE REMEMBERED ENJOYED IN HIS LIFETIME NO NATURAL RIGHT TO DETERMINE WHAT SHOULD BECOME OF HIS ESTATE AFTER DEATH THE RIGHT TO MAKE A WILL IS CONFERRED BY STATUTE THE RIGHT OF THE HEIRATLAW AND THE NEXTOFKIN TO INHERIT WHERE THERE IS NO WILL IS JUST AS FIRMLY FIXED BY THE LAW WHOEVER WOULD EXERCISE THE PRIVILEGE OF GIVING AWAY HIS PROPERTY BY A LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT MUST CONFORM TO ALL THE CONDITIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SEEN FIT TO IMPOSE THE INSTRUMENT MUST BE IN WRITING DULY SIGNED AND WITNESSED SURELY IT IS NO HARDSHIP FOR HIM WHO DESIRES TO CHANGE THE DEVOLUTION OF HIS PROPERTY UPON HIS DECEASE FROM HIS HEIRS OR NEXTOFKIN TO BE REQUIRED TO SPECIFY IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE WORDS THAT WHICH IT IS HIS WISH SHALL BE DONE WITH IT TO BE PLAIN AND SIMPLE OF SPEECH HOWEVER IS NOT EASY MANY A WELLEDUCATED PERSON IS UNABLE TO SAY WHAT HE MEANS SO READILY AS CAN THE MAN WHO IS NOT EVEN ABLE TO WRITE HIS NAME THE LAW IS LENIENT IN RESPECT TO INFELICITY OF WORDING IS TOLERANT OF AN OB SCURITY OF MEANING WILLS ARE OFTEN DRAWN UP AND EXECUTED IN HASTE MANY WILLS ARE WRITTEN BY PERSONS WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN HOW TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES WITH EITHER CLEARNESS OR PRECISION DEC 590CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS THE LAW THEREFORE SAYS THAT A TESTATORS WISHES IF NOT AIMED AT WHAT IS ILLEGAL IN CHARACTER SHALL BE CARRIED INTO EFFECT WHEREVER THE COURT CAN BE REASONABLY ASSURED OF WHAT THOSE WISHES ARE THE TROUBLESOME QUESTION PRESENTS ITSELF WHAT DID J S MEAN BY EMPLOYING THIS LANGUAGE READY ENOUGH WOULD BE THE AN SWER WERE THE JUDGE AT LIBERTY TO ANNOUNCE THAT J S MEANT WHAT HE THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE DONE HAD HE BEEN J S A FIRST STEP IS TO ASCERTAIN WHO J S WAS AND WHAT POSITION HE OCCUPIED TO WARD THE REST OF MANKIND WHEN HE SIGNED HIS NAME TO HIS LAST WILL AS THE COURT IS LED OFTEN TO REMARK WE ARE TO PUT OUR SELVES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE PLACE OF J S AT THE DATE WHEN HE EXECUTED THE INSTRUMENT IN QUESTION MUCH IS HEARD BY THE LAYMAN ABOUT THE INTENTION OF THE TES TATOR IT IS A PHRASE IN CONSTANT USE NOTHING SOUNDS MORE CHEERING THAN THE WORDS THE TESTATORS INTENTION IS THE POLE STAR AT FIRST BLUSH IT LOOKS SIMPLE ENOUGH ALL ONE HAS TO DO IT APPEARS IS TO SEE WHAT THE TESTATOR INTENDED AND FOLLOW OUT HIS DIRECTIONS UNFORTUNATELY IN THE CASE AT BAR THE TESTATOR OR THE LAWYER WHO PREPARED THE WILL HAD MANAGED TO JUMBLE THINGS TOGETHER IN SUCH CONFUSION THAT IT BECOMES A PUZZLE TO GUESS WHAT IN THE WORLD CAN BE THE TRUE MEANING LET US SUP POSE HOWEVER THAT THE LANGUAGE UNDER REVIEW IS FAIRLY INTELLI GIBLE AND YET NOT CERTAIN MORE OR LESS DOUBT WE PERCEIVE AT TACHES TO SOME PORTIONS OF THE WILL HOW IS THAT DOUBT TO BE DISPELLED  IN ALL CAUSES ALIKE NO MATTER WHAT MAY BE THE NATURE OF THE QUESTION INVOLVED THE JUDGE STRIVES TO DO EXACT JUSTICE TO THE PARTIES WHEN THE RECORD IS MADE UP THERE SHALL NOT BE A SCIN TILLA OF FAVOR SHOWN TO ONE SIDE MORE THAN TO THE OTHER THE JUDGE MAKES AN HONEST EFFORT IN WHICH HE GENERALLY SUCCEEDS TO PASS UPON THE QUESTION IN HIS OWN MIND JUST AS IF IT HAD BEEN PRESENTED IN THE ABSTRACT NEVER HAS A HAPPIER EXPRESSION BEEN GIVEN TO THIS FOUNDATION PRINCIPLE THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE WORDS OF RUFUS CHOATE IN HIS FAMOUS SPEECH UPON THE QUESTION BEFORE THE MASSACHUSETTS CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AS TO THE ELECTION OF JUDGES HE SHALL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE PARTIES EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CASE HE SHALL DO EVERYTHING FOR JUSTICE NOTHING FOR HIM 1909 59115 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER SELF NOTHING FOR HIS FRIENDS NOTHING FOR HIS PATRON NOTHING FOR HIS SOVEREIGN    TO BE HONEST TO BE NO RESPECTER OF PER SONS IS NOT YET ENOUGH HE MUST BE BELIEVED SUCH4 ALL THIS IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF COURSE THAT PERHAPS IT HAS BEEN SUPERFLUOUS TO MENTION IT IN ONE RESPECT A CASE INVOLVING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A WILL DIFFERS FROM OTHER CLASSES OF CASES THE PROCEDURE IS CHIEFLY CON FINED TO AN ENQUIRY INTO FACTS IT SEEKS EXPLANATION OF A SET OF WORDS WHOSE PRECISE COUNTERPART UNDER EXACTLY SIMILAR CONDI TIONS OF TIME PLACE AND PARTIES INTERESTED IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE OF RECURRENCE FROM SUCH EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE COURT THERE IS ABSENT THAT WHOLESOME RESTRAINT WHICH GROWS OUT OF THE CIR CUMSTANCE THAT THE DECISION ABOUT TO BE RENDERED MAY BECOME A PRECEDENT WE TERM THE RESTRAINT WHOLESOME BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY ACTS AS A CAUTION BUT SERVES TO NARROW THE FIELD WHEREIN FOR THE TIME BEING THE COURT MOVES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS DUTY5 THIS RESTRAINT IS TO A LARGE EXTENT IF NOT ENTIRELY RE MOVED WHEN THE COURT SEES THAT WHICHEVER WAY IT SHALL DECIDE THE PENDING CAUSE NO ONE IS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED OTHER THAN THE PARTIES TO THE RECORD THE DUTY THAT THE JUDGES HAVE IN HAND IN CONSTRUING THE MEANING OF A WILL LEADS THEM INTO THE FIELD OF SPECULATION WHATEVER CONCLUSION THEY REACH THEIR FINDING WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE CITED AS AUTHORITY6 AS A RESULT WE FIND IN THIS CLASS OF CASES A FREEDOM OF ACTION WHICH MORE THAN ONCE HAS 4NOT LONG SINCE A DISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE TAKES UP A CASE IN CONFERENCE IT IS NO UNUSUAL THING FOR HIM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN WHO WERE THE COUNSEL THAT HAD ARGUED IT MORE THAN ONCE IT HAS HAPPENED WHERE A POINT OF VERY GREAT INTEREST WAS UP FOR DECISION HE THINKING ONLY OF THE LAW QUESTION INVOLVED HAD LOST ALL MEMORY OF THE NAMES OF THE PARTIES TO THE RECORD THE LATE MR JUSTICE STRONG OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES ONCE SAID IN REPLY TO A QUESTION OF MINE AS TO EXPRESSIONS HE HAD USED IN A LEADING CASE UPON THE SUBJECT OF

AND LEARNED TEXTWRITER WHO HAS PERMITTED HIMSELF TO INDULGE IN A RATHER FREE CRITICISM OF DECISIONS PARTLY NO DOUBT BECAUSE HAVING LONG SAT WITH DISTINCTION UPON THE BENCH HE HAD GATHERED FROM EXPERIENCE A KNOWLEDGE OF HOW EASY IT IS TO FALL INTO ERROR HAS REMARKED OF CASES THAT DEAL WITH THE SUBJECT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE LANGUAGE OF WILLS THAT THEY ARE LIABLE TO BE DETERMINED VERY MUCH UPON THE TASTE OR WHIM OF THE COURT7 THIS STRICTURE IT IS TO BE NOTED WAS PASSED MANY YEARS AGO ANCIENTLY THE COURTS IN TREATING OF THESE CASES IN DULGED THEMSELVES IN A LATITUDE THAT WOULD NOW BE DEEMED EXTRA ORDINARY OUR AUTHOR CONTINUING INFORMS US THAT THERE EXISTS A VERY GENERAL FEELING IN ALL JUDICIAL TRIBUNALS WHETHER IN THIS COUNTRY OR IN ENGLAND THAT THE EARLIER DECISIONS UPON THIS POINT WERE MANY OF THEM UNREASONABLE AND INDEFENSIBLE AND NOT A FEW OF THEM VERGING VERY CLOSELY UPON THE LUDICROUS AND THE ABSURD8 WHERE A TESTATOR UNDERTAKES TO GIVE MONEY TO A PUBLIC CHARITY IT IS APPARENT THAT THERE MAY BE MORE OR LESS DANGER OF INFLUENCES THAT AFFECT THE OCCUPANT OF THE BENCH ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY IN A DIREC TION WHICH DOES CREDIT TO THE HEART WHILE NOT STRICTLY RESPONSIVE TO THE DEMANDS OF A COLD INEXORABLE LOGIC THIS IS THE CLASS OF CASES WE ARE LED TO SUSPECT WHERE COURTS ARE MOST APT IF AT ALL TO WRITE A WILL FOR THE TESTATOR DO COURTS ACTUALLY YIELD TO A TEMPTATION OF THIS DESCRIPTION IN CAUSES WHERE THE UPHOLDING OF A BEQUEST TO CHARITY IS AT STAKE TO PUT THE QUESTION IN ANOTHER FORM DOES THE HEIRATLAW RE CEIVE AT THE HANDS OF THE COURT PRECISELY THE SAME CONSIDERATION AS DOES THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTION WHICH IT WAS THE CHERISHED PUR POSE OF A TESTATOR TO ENDOW THEORETICALLY TO EACH PARTY ARE ACCORDED HIS FULL LEGAL RIGHTS THE SCALES ARE HELD IN PERFECT BALANCE WE ARE PERSUADED AS IS EVERY LAWYER THAT PRACTICALLY ALSO THE TWO PARTIES ARE TREATED PRECISELY ALIKE THAT A COURT EX INDUSTRIA WRITES A NEW WILL FOR A TESTATOR NOBODY BELIEVES THAT A BIAS MORE OR LESS STRONG EXISTS IN FAVOR OF SUSTAINING IF POS SIBLE A PUBLIC CHARITY TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE HEIRATLAW FEW 7II REDFIELD ON WILLS 3RD ED 1876 P 384 SIBID P 385 2 1909 59315 VIRGINIA LAW

ACTLY THE SAME MEASURE OF RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION AS THE MOST DESERVING CHARITY AND YET AS HE LOOKS THROUGH THE REPORTS ONE WILL FIND SUCH OBSERVATIONS AS THE FOLLOWING WHICH COMES FROM A JUDGE WHO IS SPEAKING OF GIFTS TO CHARITABLE USES COURTS HE SAYS GIVE EFFECT TO THEM WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO SO CONSISTENT WITH RULES OF LAW AND TO THAT END THE MOST LIBERAL RULES THE NATURE OF THE CASE WOULD ADMIT OF WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ORDINARY CHANCERY JURISDICTION WILL BE RESORTED TO IF NECESSARY9 HERE THE JUDGE IS ALLUDING TO THE CY PRES DOCTRINE WHICH IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE NOTHING THAT ANSWERS TO THE SIGN MAN UAL OF THE KING IS A BROAD POWER THAT IN SOME STATES IS RECOG NIZED AS RESIDING IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE CONFERRED UPON THE COURTS A POWER TO PREFER A CHARITY TO THE HEIRATLAW SO AS TO JUSTIFY THEM IN LAYING HOLD OF SLIGHT REASONS TO SUSTAIN A GIFT MADE TO CHARITABLE USES SINCE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE PROPERTY OF A DECEASED PER SON IS ONLY GIVEN BY THE STATE THERE CAN BE NO ROOM FOR FINDING FAULT IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE POWER HAS ACTUALLY BEEN BESTOWED UPON THE COURTS BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH GRANT OF POWER ONE IS JUSTIFIED IN A BELIEF THAT THE HEIR IS ENTITLED TO BE REGARDED WITH JUST AS MUCH FAVOR AS ANY CHARITABLE INSTITUTION THE TESTATOR MAY HAVE HAD IN MIND WE WILL NOT BE MISUNDER STOOD WHEN WE SAY THAT IT IS IN HUMAN NATURE TO DEEM THE CHAR ITY MORE DESERVING THAN THE HEIR THE DOCTRINE OF CY PRES FINDS ITS SUPPORT IN THIS FEELING YET IT MUST APPEAR TO SOME MINDS THAT EXAMPLES ARE BY NO MEANS FEW WHERE STRICT JUSTICE WOULD SEEM NOT TO HAVE BEEN EXERCISEDTO SUCH AN EXTREMITY HAS THE DOCTRINE OF CY PRES BEEN PUSHED INDEED THE ENGLISH DOCTRINE OF CY PRES WHEN APPLIED WITH A FREE HAND COMES VERY NEAR ANSWERING

MEANT    BUT SIMPLYWHAT IS THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS15 A LIKE IDEA IS CONVEYED BY LORD ELDON IN LANGUAGE WHICH IS FREQUENTLY QUOTED THE QUESTION IS NOT SO MUCH WHAT WAS THE INTENTION AS WHAT IN THE

THE CON STRUCTION OF WILLS HAS NOT HESITATED TO DECLARE THERE APPEARS TO BE IN THIS MAXIM A FALLACY OF NO SMALL IM PORTANCE FRANCIS VAUGHAN HAWKINS MAKES THIS COMMENT IN A VALUABLE PAPER PREPARED FOR THE JURIDICAL SOCIETY ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION WITH REFERENCE ESPECIALLY TO THE INTERPRETA TION OF WILLS WITH SINGULAR PERSPICACITY THIS ACUTE WRITER HAS POINTED OUT WHAT SEEMS NOW TO HAVE BECOME ACCEPTED AS THE TRUE METHOD OF INTERPRETATION HE MAKES IT PLAIN THAT EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE SHOULD BE FREELY USED WHENEVER NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE INTENTION OF THE TESTATOR ALTHOUGH THE PROCEDURE HE SUPPORTS IS DIRECTLY OP POSITE TO THAT INDICATED BY SIR JAMES WIGRAM THE READER WE THINK WILL BE SATISFIED THAT THE VIEWS OF HAWKINS ARE SOUND IT IS THE SENSE IN WHICH A TESTATOR INTENDED

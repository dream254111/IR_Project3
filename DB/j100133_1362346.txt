female Phainopepla Phainopepla nitens within the city of Marysville California The species is rare in this vicinity even in summer its appearance is quite casual When disovered this individual was feeding upon a cluster of mistletoe berries in a black walnut tree It was not particularly shy and was reluctant to desert such an excellent feeding ground as I found when I attempted to frighten her from the place She refused to leave and after circling widely returned to the tree Examination of the bird in hand showed it to be in appar ent good health and the body was very fat The stomach was distended with the mis tletoe berriesCARL S MULLER Marysville California Three New Records for KansasIn a preliminary examination of a collection of bird skins made personally at Independence southeastern Kansas in 1904 and 1905 three forms have been identified that apparently have not been previously recorded from that State All are Lower Austral forms ranging up from the south along the val ley of the Verdigris River A Flicker male no 584 coll A W taken November 28 1904 is Colaptes auratus auratus as it has a wing measurement of only 1513 millimeters The Northern Flicker occurs also as a winter migrant and is represented by specimens in the collection Two Downy Woodpeckers secured are Dryobates pubescens pubescens These speci mens have the following measurements in millimeters Wing Tail No 683 coll A W male Jan 3 1905 878 535 No 783 coll A W female March 1 1905 885 570 The Chickadees from this region are of more interest Thirteen were secured rang ing in dates from December 5 1904 to April 27 1905 and all are referred to Penthestes carolinensis agilis The northern limit of the Texas Chickadee has been given as Stil well and Fort Reno Oklahoma Ridgway Birds of North and Middle America vol IIi p 406 These Kansas records therefore constitute an important extension in the known range of this formALEX WETMORE Biological Survey Washington D C130 THE CONDOR Vol XVII Red Phalaropes Near Corona CaliforniaTwo male Red Phalaropes Phalaropus fulicarius were shot November 7 1914 on one of the ponds of the Pomona Recreation Club which is situated near the Santa Ana River about eight miles north of Corona Riverside County California The two birds are now numbers 506 and 507 of my col lection It would seem that this is worthy of note since this species usually migrates over the ocean and this locality where they were taken is a considerable distance in landWRIGHT M PIERCE Claremont California Some Extreme Nesting DatesIn comparing Willetts Birds of the Pacific Slope of Southern California with some of my own notes I find the following nesting dates among the latter that appear somewhat unusual Selasphorus alleni Allen Hummingbird Catalina Island March 22 1910 two eggs incubation advanced Sturnella neglecta Western Meadowlark Los Angeles February 15 1909 four eggs fresh Hirundo erythrogastra Barn Swallow Balboa Beach June 13 1908 two eggs fresh Riparia riparia Bank Swallow San Pedro April 26 1908 five eggs incubation advanced Lanius ludovicianus gambeli California Shrike Los Angeles February 8 1908 four eggs freshD I SHEPARDSON LOS Angeles California Yellowbilled LoonA CorrectionIn writing the life history of the littleknown species Gavia adamsi I have been puzzled to know what to do with the supposed Colo rado record of this species I have always suspected that the record was based on erroneous identification as Colorado is so far away from the known range or migration route of this Arctic Loon The specimen upon which the record was based was taken by Mr William G Smith near Loveland Colorado on May 25 1885 A letter from Mr Smith to Major Bendire giving the details of its capture is now in my hands and states that the bird was sold to Mr Manly Hardy of Brewer Maine now deceased Knowing that the Hardy collection was recently purchased for the Rhode Island Audubon Society and is now in the Park Museum in Providence I wrote to my friend Mr Harry S Hathaway of that city for his opinion as to the identity of the specimen He very kindly investigated the matter and sent me his report together with a letter on the subject from Mrs Fanny Hardy Eckstorm which strengthened my doubts and practically convinced me that the record was based on an error For my own personal satisfaction I went to Providence and examined the specimen with Mr Hathaway It is not a Yellowbilled Loon but it is a very curious specimen of a Common Loon Gavia immer and I am not surprised that Mr Hardy and others who have seen it have been puzzled Its entire plumage is decidedly worn and faded to a dull brownish shade It is a young male in the immature plumage of the first year Its bill is certainly yellow the yellowest or lightest colored bill I have ever seen in any young Loon which probably led to its identification as Gavia adamsi but the size and shape of the bill agrees with Gavia immer and not with G adamsi The culmen meas ures about 320 inches and the depth of the bill at the base is about 90 Ridgways Manual gives for adamsi culmen 350 to 365 and depth 100 to 120 and for immer culmen 275 to 350 and depth 90 to 105 inches The bird in question is small even for Gavia immer notwithstanding the fact that it is a male and it has a particularly slen der bill even for that species instead of the large heavy bill with the straight culmen so characteristic of Gavia adamsi It is only fair to Mr Hardy to say that he was in doubt about the bird and that the record never ought to have stood without verification I cannot understand why some one who was competent to identify the bird did not examine the specimen before the record was published which would have prevented the frequent repetition of an error which can never be wholly rectified Such errors are far too common and I hope that this one will be corrected in the next edition of the A O U CheckListA C BENT Taunton MassachusettsMay 1915 FROM FIELD AND STUDY 131 A Remarkable Flight of Sparrow HawksWhile travelling north on the Santa Fe Railway above Albuquerque New Mexico along the Rio Grande River in the late after noon of September 13 1914 an enormous flight of Western Sparrow Hawks Falco spar verius phaloena was passed Thousands sailed by in a continuous stream all working leisurely south often a hundred or more in sight from the car window at one time Indi viduals frequently alighted on convenient trees and telegraph poles and all seemed on the lookout for food The flight seemed to be confined to the vicinity of the river and its adjacent thickets of rank weeds and willows interspersed with stretches of green meadow and alfalfa A very few larger hawks were seen but whether migrating with the Sparrow Hawks or not could not be determined Of these a Prairie Falcon a dark Swainson Hawk and a male Marsh Hawk were identified As no specimens were taken it is probably presuming to state positively that these were the Western variety Why shouldnt they be Eastern or even both Eastern and Western drawn together from a vast expanse of barren territory along the converging tributaries of the Rio Grande River and held in a concentrated flight by the grasshop pers and mice so abundant in this oasis strip Travelling south along the Rio Grande river on the morning of September 15th two days later in the vicinity of Rincon New Mexico some two hundred miles farther south not a trace of this flight was left Or had the birds not yet arrivedJ EUGENE LAW Hollywood California BlackandWhite Warbler at Berkeley CaliforniaMarch 18 1915 a female Black andWhite Warbler Mniotilta varia was noted in a large live oak tree on the lower part of the University of California campus When first seen against a strong light its colors could not be made out but its actions resembled those of a creeper Later it was seen under more favorable conditions The strikingly contrasted black and white strip ing on the upper surface and the unmarked under parts indicative of the female the zigzag hopping movement along the larger limbs and short circling flights were all then clearly noted Compared with other warblers occurring on the campus it seems to spend more of its time on the under surface of large limbs A faint call note was the only sound heard Mr A C Shelton and Mr E P Rankin were present at the time the bird was seen and we all immediately repaired to the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and verified the identification by examining skins of this and other species To my knowl edge this is the fifth record of the species for CaliforniaTRACY I STORER Berkeley California Early Spring Notes from WestCentral CaliforniaThe following are some data picked up this spring 1915 at odd moments during my regular work along railroad lines February 19

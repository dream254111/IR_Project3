j100358,The School Review,1074651,Report on Admission to College on Certificate and by Examination,i244530,N E ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARA TORY SCHOOLS 593 men every day Here is a telegram of forty words to which a reply should be sent in ten Here is a letter of a thousand words which should be answered in fifty Every professional man is examined severely every day of his life He is forced to bring to the examination every idea and all the skill that he has The surgeon is suddenly called upon to perform the operation for appendicitis some men indeed twenty a week and no two alike In each operation every bit of his knowledge of the anatomy of those parts may be brought into play and he works under stress of excitement and responsibility The test is very much the same in kind as the sudden examination of a pupil at school but fiercer So with the lawyer every case in court involves a cram and an examination The trouble with school examinations is that it is difficult to offer children appropriate tests of their power This is the point at which we have failed The next item of business is the report of the committee to confer with the Commission of Colleges in New England on Admission Examinations This report relates to admission to college by certificate and by examination It will be presented by the chairman Mr Ramsay of Fall River MR CHARLES CORNELL RAMSAY Principal of the B M C Durfee High School Fall River Mr President ladies and gentlemenI take pleasure in submitting to you at this time as chairman of your Committee of Conference with the New England College Commission our REPORT ON ADMISSION TO COLLEGE ON CERTIFICATE AND BY EXAMINATION Before your committee was assigned the duty of investigating and report ing on the two methods of admission to college now in use it was doubtless believed that a difference of opinion on the subject existed among school and college teachers and the results of our work which later in this report I have summarized clearly justify such a belief The question is therefore a debatable one Allow me to call your attention at the threshold of the subject to I SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS In the serious consideration of any important question it is desirable indeed it is necessaryto find a fundamental basis upon which the discussionTHE SCHOOL REVIEW may rest and from which it may proceed This is true not only that the structure of argument may have a foundation not only  moreover  because the problem can by such a method be more easily solved but also since in matters fundamental and essentialmen are pretty generally agreed Those who dissent from one another often start from the same premises or assumptions but reach different conclusions because they draw different inferences from the facts In the present instance as in so many others we must seek in the field of ideals the basis we need and here let me remark upon the harmony or the similarity not to say the identity  of the ideals of all persons of the same class Particularly is this true of the ideals of educated men As edu cators our ideals or highest aims are very much alike we differ chiefly in the means by which to attain them The principal ideal of every wise worthy and progressive headmaster is freedom freedom to do or to attempt to do the best things in what he conceives to be the best ways Such a headmaster regards the educa tion of his pupils as his great aim and his chief responsibility but he sees it broadly as a manysided allinclusive process He feels that intellectually education is the growth and development of mental power through selfactivity in a stimulating and soliciting environment He knows that no exercise no effort no performance has genuine or permanent edu cative value that is not accompanied by or founded upon interest Free dom spontaneity interest these are the characteristic or dominant notes in his ideal intellectually for his pupils and his school He desires the price less opportunity to enkindle in the minds of his pupils an insatiable thirst for knowledge a fervent love of learning a permanent and profound attachment to the intellectual life which as Philip Gilbert Hamerton truly says consists not so much in extent of knowledge as in the constant preference of higher thoughts over lower thoughts In contemplation of this aspect of his impor tant work the headmaster remembers the eloquent and forcible words of Plato in which he describes the man of culture and of philosophic character A lover not of a part of wisdom but of the whole who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and is curious to learn and is never satisfied who has magnifi cence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence who is harmoniously constituted of a wellproportioned and gracious mind whose own nature will move spontaneously towards the true being of everything who has a good memory and is quick to learn noble gracious the friend of truth justice courage and temperance Republic pp 475487 Jowetts translation Ethically he regards his work as of supreme importance At every step he feels that he must develop the idea of the right and stimulate the undying love of righteousness in the minds and hearts of his pupils He deeply feels his obligation to develop and strengthen in them a fine sense of honor purity selfrespect and unselfish regard for the rights and feelings of others He would found truth upon the love of truth and establish the intellect upon the 594N E ASSOCIA TION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARA TOR Y SCHOOLS 595 heart and so labor that day by day more and more shall respect to rever ence grow Nor will he neglect the important culture in his pupils of the sense of beauty in nature art and human life and conduct Under his influence and guidance they will grow into a nice appreciation of the excellence and service to man of all the nobler arts of expression and come to hate the tawdry vulgar and commonplace They will be led to see that true beauty is not only the garment but also of the very substance of truth and they will be led to feel moreover that beauty and goodness are so absolutely one that the acme of esthetic taste and attainment is  the beauty of holiness From his acquaintance with the facts and principles of sociology eco nomics and political science the worthy headmaster conceives his just func tions in terms much broader than mere pedagogic performance He recognizes as expressed by Commissioner W T Harris in the report of the Committee of Fifteen that The requirement of the civilization into which the child is born as determining not only what he shall study in school but what habits and customs he shall be taught in the family before the school age arrives as well as that he shall acquire a skilled acquaintance with some one of a definite series of trades professions or vocations in the years that follow school and furthermore that this question of the relation of the pupil to his civilization determines what political duties he shall assume and what religious faith or spiritual aspirations he shall adopt for the conduct of his life He will therefore desire not only the freedom but also the stimulation from all influences affecting his administration so to arrange the program of studies in his school that every pupil shall be prepared to fill the niche in life for which he by nature was designed He would so wisely teach that his pupils aptitudes shall be strongly developed to the end that they shall not only not make shipwreck of their lives but rather shall do their full share of the worlds great work But the worthy headmaster although he is specially charged with the responsibility from which he cannot escape of looking out for the welfare of the secondary schoolis also deeply interested in what precedes and what follows this period He appreciates the solidarity of education he is con cerned about the final product the ultimate success of the whole educational course His aim is the highest service of society and hence he is anxious to place in the hands of the college instructor the best material for the work of the latter He desires to prevent all possible waste in education which after allis but a waste of human life and therefore he wishes to send up to the college and the university men who are thoroughly prepared to profit by the splendid opportunities that will there be offered them Having thus briefly surveyed the field of our ideals and expressed in inadequate terms what is to us trite and familiar it is perhaps scarcely neces sary for me to say thatto test the worth or worthlessness of every part of our present school machinery and of every proposed alteration or addition toTHE SCHOOL REVIEW the same we must first subject it to measurement by our ideal standards Whatever bears such a test that is whatever will help us to approximate the realization of our ideal aimswe regard as good and we think worthy of our approval and adoption Does admission to college on certificate from the secondary school bear this test  Does admission to college by examination by the college authori ties bear this test  Do both or neither bear it  Such are the important questions we are set to consider at this hour In endeavoring to answer these questions the wise headmaster remem bers that he is bringing into conjunction the real and the ideal the inner world of reality and the outer world of practical life At once he recognizes in the latter the imperfection of human nature and the defects of the best laid plansplans whose purpose may be like the tower of Babel to reach even to heaven itself He soon comes upon the realm of expediency wherein he often discovers that even some evils or inadequate or unsatisfactory means are necessary until greater wisdom shall reveal a better way and that of several evils he must choose the least Such may be the truth regarding admission to college both on certificate and by examination Not all headmasters are wise worthy and progressive and even in case of those who are their assistants are not always so or when both are the school authorities or patrons of the school are sometimes selfish and exert a powerful influence to compass undesirable or unworthy ends Parenthetically let me here say that a headmaster may consistently follow the rule to certify for college only those of his pupils who have attained a rank above a certain point in his scale of marks and thus treating all alike seek to do justice to each while trying to send properly prepared candidates to college My own rules are as follows I The candidate must have taken the work prescribed for admission to the college of his choice 2 he must have done in my own school during term time the work for which he seeks my certificate and 3 he must have attained in such work a grade of A or B in a scale of marks A B C D D being failure But such rules however impartially followed do not remedy all the defects of admission to college on certificate At first glance the method of admission on certificate seems to be in harmony with our ideal aims and therefore satisfactory It seems to permit and encourage freedom spontaneity and interest and to give the school its true function that of education rather than of mere instruction the develop ment of mental power moral character and elevated tastes rather than the imparting of fixed quantities of knowledge and under more ideal conditions such would be really the fact But in practice this is often far from the truth Not infrequently certified candidates for college who are not well prepared are admitted and although theoretically all students admitted on certificate are on probation for a period after entrance we hear of few who are dropped from the roll for inadequate preparatory work Human nature 596N E ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORYSCHOOLS 597 being what it is teachers and pupils in general there are exceptions really need a stimulus from external sources to overcome sluggishness and self satisfaction to say nothing of the loss through the certificate system of the enrichment and strengthening of both methods of teaching and courses of study that might result from a wise exarriination system in which a good col lege could exert a more direct and more effective influence on the schools On the relation of the teachers of a school to the question at issue the head master of a wellknown academy wrote me as follows The preparatory schools cannot do without the drastic stimulus of an entrance examination to college Masters are lazysome lazier than others but lazy The colleges may talk until Time grows gray but they the masters will not act with vigor unless they see the grim necessity right before them of working daily six days each week to enable boys to enter college with credit Given the college and anxious parents to apply the spur and most masters will come to time As in Christian ethics we have for a considerable time placed more emphasis on the hedonistic than upon the Stoical element upon the desire to be happy than upon the power to endure hardness so in education we have been laying more stress upon the pleasurable conditions affecting the pupil than upon his training to fight the battles and meet the crises of life This statement marks my transition from the consideration of the certificate system to the consideration of the examination system of admission to college There are those who affirm that it is much easier to impart knowledge and inspire intellectual enthusiasm perhaps they mean to try to do these things  than to test the pupil to determine whether he has received it Although I do not grant this to be true yet I concede that all judgments of others are intrinsically difficult To determine mental power as well as the possession of knowledge is no easy matter Indeed when one considers that justice here is supremely important he must admit the grave responsibility of pass ing judgment on anyone including his pupils Merit ability effort moral worth are sometimes elusive qualities and it must be freely admitted that examinations of any sort do not always discover their presence or absence But with slight modifications hereinafter to be mentioned I can but think the collegeadmission examinations are the best known method of reaching if not a satisfactory conclusion then at least the best working hypothesis regarding the fitness of the candidate for entrance On the question of the action of collegeadmission examinations upon the candidates for college let me quote again from the letter from which I have already read an extract I fail to understand why a boy properly fitted dreads a collegeentrance exami nation unless he belongs to that small class of nervous boys who should be exempt from such a strain On the other hand a boy should learn to welcome the exami nation test just as he welcomes a match game of football after weeks of football practice Previously he has had hundreds of written tests scores in each subject presumably given by clever teachers Why should one more daunt him  In myTHE SCHOOL REVIEW experience boys who belong in college care little for entrance examinations They expect to pass them they do pass them As for the weaklings who cant pass them because of alleged nervousness they do not belong in college They should turn their attention to business or go to work and fit themselves for college The idea that a boy cannot tell what he knows is arrant nonsense In passing it is interesting to compare the apparently conflicting opinions on the subject of two college instructors Professor J M Coulter of the University of Chicago says To compel schools to differentiate early a small and select and expensive class for entrance to the universities is unfair both to the school and to the university and seriously checks the diffusion of higher education To deny the privilege of breathing the university atmosphere to any product of a good secondary school involves such a narrow conception of education that one dislikes to associate it with the university It has always seemed an anomaly that universities are inclined rather to rate themselves upon the basis of their raw material than their finished product A finemeshed screen is set up at the beginning of the university career when it would seem far more logical to set it up at the other end Professor W M Warren of Boston University writes None of us wish the truth to be sealed away from any searcher no matter how humble or how unintelligent but it seems to me better on the whole that there should be places where minds of superior endowment should have a chance to come at the truth and to gain skill in finding it without hindrance from those who are relatively incompetent The conception of a college as a public fountain where an impersonal truth flows for all without respect to present condition of servitude and where each is welcome to partake in the measure of his particular capacity no matter how lim ited appeals to the democratic spirit in us but it overlooks the fact that deep drinking is no easy matter when the spring is roiled with a press of pint cups The college is not the only place where truth can be learned and the intellectual habit acquired for my part I should gladly see it kept for the capable I have said that these two opinions were only apparently conflicting for surely Professor Coulter could not have intended to advocate the admission to college of poorly prepared imperfectly trained or mentally inferior stu dents He was doubtless speaking of the narrow traditional list of entrance subjects which effectually debars able students from some colleges Probably he would approve the sound views of Professor Warren II RESULTS OF LETTERS OF INQUIRY With the approval of the other members of my committee I sent out a list of questions to the headmasters of thirtysix secondary schools selected as typical of the whole class of preparatory schools In this selection care was taken that the answers should come from gentlemen whose wisdom and experience qualified them to express opinions entitled to careful considera tion Sufficient funds for a wider investigation were not placed at our disposal nor did we deem such necessary Another list I sent to the chair men of the committees on admission of seventeen colleges in New England 598N E ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS 599 and the middle states Of the thirtysix schools addressed answers were received from all but of these only twentynine were so framed as to be of use All the colleges addressed responded to at least a part of my questions As instructors in schools and colleges are closer to the individual student than the heads of these institutions I deemed it advisable to send the ques tions to the teachers of a particular school and of a particular college

did not bring out very definite or very useful information for this reason When a college admits on certificate all but the very poorest pupils in the schools from which certificates are accepted will present the certificate There remain to be examined therefore the refuse of those schools and the young men who have presumably been trained at poorer schools consequently at every college which admits on certificate a large majority of the men who excel in scholarship general mental ability moral character and application to their studies have come in on certificate In other words such colleges do not possess sufficient and proper data to make a just comparison between the two methods of admission The chair men of the committees on admission of the best colleges accepting certifi cates have however written me franklythough speaking for themselves but not without support from several of their collegesthat they would give up the certificate system provided other colleges would agree to do the same III CONFERENCE WITH THE NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE COMMISSION The Commission of Colleges in New England on Admission Examina tions courteously gave your committee a hearing at its annual meeting at Boston University April 28 I900 As the proceedings of that meeting are now printed and obtainable from the secretary Professor W C Poland of Brown University I will not detain you to give you a report of it It should be said however that after the commission had listened to our remarks and recommendations they confined their deliberations not to the abolition of the certificate system but to various methods of better administering it It does not appear that the commission as a whole favors examinations as the exclusive method of admission to college IV OBJECTIONS TO THE CERTIFICATE SYSTEM It is doubtless already clear to you that I do not favor the certificate system as at present used and in this opinion I represent the other members of your committee The objections to the system were so admirably stated by Presi dent Eliot in his answer to the letter of inquiry that I quote them I The certificate method diminishes the influence of colleges on secondary schools and particularly it deprives colleges of the means of influencing the programs of study and the methods of teaching in the secondary schools That influence has been in the past a valuable one 2 It deprives the public of the best means of learning the comparative merits or value of different secondary schools 3 It deprives a good secondary school of the best existing means of demonstrat ing that it is good or that it is better than its neighbors 602N E ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARA TORY SCHOOLS 603 4 It subjects the headmasters of some public and private schools to a strain which the colleges or the community has no right to put upon them since the head masters of some schools are almost forced to give certificates to pupils whom they know not to deserve them From this point of view the method seems to me very enfeebling as to both discipline and scholarship To the above I add another 5 The colleges ought not to vest in the headmaster or his assistants the power to determine who shall enter their freshman classes but should retain it in their own hands No grammarschool principal or teachers should be given the power to say who should enter a high school The principal of a high school and his assistants should determine the fitness of all applicants for admission but in such determination they should of course take into consideration the prior school history of each candidate and such a history should be furnished by the principals of the grammar schools Precisely so do I conceive the rela tions of the preparatory schools and the colleges Whether justly or unjustly some of the colleges admitting students on certificate have incurred the criticism of seeking mere numbers of empha sizing quantity more than quality of  worshiping the golden calf In so far as such an idea has gained lodgment in the public mind the cause of the higher education in general and the reputation of those colleges in particular have suffered As every true friend of culture is jealous for the leadership of the colleges in education science literature and the liberal arts such degradation in public esteem is a matter for sincere regret While the examination method may be so loosely used as to lead to the same result certainly it gives the colleges far greater control over their own standards than does the certificate method of admission for although in theory those admitted on certificate are on probation for one term and their school is on probation all the time few candidates are ever remanded or their schools condemned V FINAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Although the analogy may not in all respects hold I think that we may in the consideration of this subjectlearn a lesson from the experience of the professions of law and medicine I have been told by members of state boards of bar and medical examiners that the vastly higher standards of preparation and the far more efficient practice of these professions are due very largely to the increasingly rigid examinations now established by law for all applicants for admission to practice which displaced the old system of certificates from preceptors It must be said however and said with emphasis that the superiority of the examination over the certificate method of admission to college depends upon the wisdom with which it is administered Narrow prescriptions of certain textbooks as at Wellesley College and a certain number of pages of texts as at several colleges areTHE SCHOOL REVIEW pernicious in their influence on the schools Likewise are all admission examinations that test scarcely more than memory in preparation of assigned work Collegeadmission examinations should test powers of thought and demand its accurate expression They should offer optionals and encourage extra or additional liberalizing reading and study thus they will strengthen the school curricula and infuse enthusiasm for learning and desire for culture and the scholarly spirit among pupils When the graduates of other col leges who are here present have written me so strongly in praise of the char acter and influence of the Harvard admission examinations I know that you will permit a Harvard man to say that in his judgment they have in the past twentyfive years greatly advanced the cause of secondary education in the United States This they have done because of the amount of conscientious and intelligent thought that has been put into them and the ability and impartiality with which Harvard has in general administered the system She has greatly increased their influence for good of late by offering exam inations in a wider range of subjects and by the issue of descriptive pam phlets in each department relating to the topics to be studied and the methods of presentation by the teacher I am not however satisfied with the examination as carried out even by Harvard To it I would add a sort of certificate not to take the place of but to be combined with the method of admission by examination to be combined with it not by any fixed rulecertainly no rule of the schools but at the discretion of the college in every individual case Such a certifi cate should be required for every candidate and should state over the head masters signature the pupils work every year in each branch and the mark he obtained at the end of the year with the name of the teacher who gave him the mark It should also state whether or not he is a graduate of the school and should be accompanied by or should contain an account of the candidate himself in relation not to scholarship but to health character and general tendencies Such a certificate should prove highly useful to college authorities in the settlement of doubtful cases at the examination or in deal ing with alleged cases of special nervousness at the examination and it should be serviceable even in the case of those who have successfully passed the entrance examination This certificate should state facts and not opin ions such as the headmasters belief that the candidate is prepared for college for while he may have very intelligent convictions on this point the history of the candidate is quite sufficient for all purposes when united with the admission examinations In the foregoing report I have no doubt presented matter that has often before been threshed out by the older members of this association yet I deem it worth while to have brought it before you if for no other purpose than as a protest against the present system of admission to college on cer tificate 604N E ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARA TORY SCHOOLS 605 DISCUSSION THE PRESIDENT IS it the pleasure of the meeting to consider the report which has now been read to you It relates as the chairman of the committee said to a subject which is certainly debatable The statistics given us in the course of this report show how greatly opinion is on the one hand divided and on the other indeterminate This is a meeting of men and women who have large experience with this question Is it the desire of the meeting to devote some moderate time to a discussion of this report  We are punctual with our business and can afford at the pleasure of the meeting to devote say half an hour to a further discussion of this subject DR WILLIAM F BRADBURY of the Cambridge Latin School Mr PresidentJust one thing simply Many things might be said I can say that I agree most thoroughly with almost everything that has been said There is just one little point that I wish to speak of where it seems to me the certificate system would have failed to do justice It is something that happened this summer I had a class in college algebra There was a young lady in it taking a postgraduate course in the Latin school who did splendid work in college algebra Noth ing could be better than the work she did I had a boy too who did wretched work in it he did not seem to know anything about it Both of them had written very many algebra examination papers in the school The boy had received very often zero on his paper I think the highest was 50 per cent but it was usually 20 or less The young lady had received from go to Ioo every time Before going to the examination I said to the young man You dont want to try this paper at Harvard You will surely fail Just as well give it up now It is of no use for you to try it When the report came from the college the girl had received  C  and the boy B and so an honor Well it astonished me I thought there must be some mistake I wrote to Radcliffe and to Harvard saying there must be some mistake in each of these cases I received word back that the papers had been looked over again in the case of both and the report was correct but both wrote to me that I could see the papers I took occasion to look carefully over the paper of the young man I have not yet seen the paper at Radcliffe but I am going to I went up to the college and the young mans papers were handed to me I copied the paper very7HE SCHOOL REVIEW carefully and carried it home I have it exactly as the boy wrote it I was gratified to find that the paper had been very carefully looked over by the board Almost every question was marked three times A mark had been given and then had been scratched out with a blue pencil another mark a different one given and then scratched out and a third mark which was left showing that either three different persons had looked the questions over or one had looked them over a second and a third time very carefully and changed his mind The sum total too had been added added again and added again and the final mark left I should not have certified that boy in college algebra I felt sure he could not pass but I think the mark on the paper was exactly right Here was an example where a boy had done something on examination and had done nothing before I can account for it quite easily that he had worked up to the last gradually growing up to it I had been over every paper with him very carefully and shown him where his trouble was and at last he went and got an honor and the college marked him right applause PROFESSOR W C POLAND of Brown University Mr President As having a connection with the commission and as a member of the committee appointed by the commission to investigate the question of the best method of administration of the certificate system I feel greatly interested in this discussion There may be some need of clear ing our ideas as to what is the basis of the certificate for admission It is possible that there is not an entire clarity of view as to what is the underlying theory or what ought to be the underlying theory of a certificate presented by a pupil for admission to college on which cer tificate practically the pupil is to be admitted in lieu of an examina tion Really there are two theories that seem to emerge in the consideration of this question It is generally assumed I think that the teacher is the final arbiter as to the fitness of the pupil for admis sion to college in all cases where a certificate is presented but there is room for a question whether that is inevitably the case I think that in all discussions that I have ever heard I have heard a number on the subject and I myself have participated in someit is generally assumed that that is the theory that underlies the certificate In consid ering the administration of the certificate question we ought to answer clearly some such question as this  What is the proper basis of a cer tificate for admission to college  Is it in the theory that the prepara tory teacher is the person best qualified to decide as to the fitness of 606N E ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS 607 a pupil to undertake the work of the freshman year or is it in the theory that an approved teacher or an approved school testifies that the pupil has performed a certain amount of work in each of the several studies required for admission while the college reserves to itself the function of judgment upon this evidence as the fitness of the pupil to undertake the work aforesaid  Or it may be put more briefly in some such form as this What is the proper function of an entrance cer tificate given by a preparatory teacher to a candidate for admission to college  Is it to admit a candidate on the judgment of the prepara tory teacher  Or is it to present testimony as to the work performed by the candidate on which testimony the examining board of the col lege shall judge whether the candidate should be admitted  Of course the certificate meant by this question is the certificate which takes the place of all other examination by college authorities The examination is not then an examination of the candidate but an exam ination of the evidence which the candidate presents It seems to me that a fair question is open here and that the solution of the question of administration will be vastly helped by answering this preliminary question That is all Mr President that I wish to do merely to present this question as a question which has appeared on several occasions I think it has appeared in the report of Mr Ramsay this morning to some degree and it has appeared elsewhere in private discussions of the matter PROFESSOR JOHN K LORD of Dartmouth College Mr President You have very happily said that this is a debatable question and any of us who have given it any consideration have found it so in our own judgment The field of debate is so wide and the opinions are so various that it will certainly be worthless to attempt to make a review of the field in such a brief time as we have It will take indeed a man who could distinguish and divide a hair twixt south and south west side to tell what the statistics which were presented to us this morning meant to the minds of the teachers My own observation and correspondence and experience have led me to feel that there is a very marked disagreement among college teachers and among secondaryschool teachers as to the benefits of one system and the other I therefore wish to offer simply one or two considerations this morning as they have occurred to me in reference to the two systemsTHE SCHOOL REVIEW Of course a certificate system with which I am reasonably familiar has two points of consideration One is its theory and the other is its administration In reference to the theory of the certificate system we have had it compared with the examination system I want to dissent from the theory that the examination for entrance to college is an educational test any further than that any event which calls upon us to test our power in this world is an educational test Nothing that helps to draw us out is other than an educational process But I disagree with the view that the examination at entrance to college set by a body of men that have had nothing to do with a previous course of training is an educational test Last night President Eliot if he will allow me to refer to himin giving some analogies to entrance examinations said that when he received a letter of a thousand words which he was to answer fully and clearly in a letter of fifty words that was an educational test I think the analogy would have been exact or more nearly exact if he had gone on to say that he knew in writ ing his reply that his position as president of Harvard University depended on the judgment of the man who wrote the letter of a thousand words whether his letter of fifty words was a satisfactory answer I venture to think that a lawyer who argues a case at the bar would regard his case somewhat differently and more in the light of a collegeentrance examination if he knew that he was going to be dis barred if he lost his case I think the physician who practices on a patient and performs an operation for appendicitis would feel that his position was more like that of a college student if he was to be debarred from the practice of medicine if his patient died I think the analogies would be fair in that way It seems to me that this examination for entrance to college stands out from all other examinations in the stress it puts upon the test It is not an educational test it is a classification test and the two are just as distinct as two things can possibly be I do not want to follow out this or to say anything further on this subject There is so much to be said that one could keep talking indefinitely But I want to call attention to one fact in reference to the correspondence between the examination and the certificate The certificate system is supposed to be definite and clear in its adminis tration that is to say it brings a student up to college with prepara tion complete and entire The colleges do as a fact make minor exceptions but as a rule a certificate is supposed to enter a man clean into college He goes in because he has done the work required either in amount or quality as the case may be and he enters without 608N E ASSOCIA TION OF COLLEGES AND PREZPARA TOR Y SCHOOLS 609 condition How is it with the examination system  I venture to say that there are more people men and girls conditioned on enter ing college who have a year or more or less in which to make up their work ten times over than come in deficient under the certificate system How is it with a man for instance who comes to college and has two years in which to make up his conditions who has a year in which to make up his conditions who has six months in which to make up his conditions  It does not make any difference what the time is if a man is conditioned on entering college it means that he is not prepared to enter college on the whole If I may put it in a homely phrase the examination opens a backdoor entrance into college it allows men to come in who are not prepared on the face of it the exami nation says they are not prepared and therefore they have to be con ditioned The result is that they come in They may take up entirely different work from that in which they have been conditioned going on with their college work and showing themselves prepared accord ing to the standardsof the college to do college work in the college but they have that long tail of work to bring up behind them I have sometimes thought in this connection Mr President that the certifi cate system does an immense benefit to a great many persons of moderate ability and yet who ought to have college education from the very fact that it allows them to enter college without conditions I think that a condition is a millstone around every persons neck that enters college with it If I had my way there should not anybody come in conditioned I thinkI wont say absolutely but almost I think that in ninetynine cases out of a hundred a condition is a hindrance and not a help If a boy or girl is really competent to do the college work he or she is competent to do it because of what he or she has got then and there not because of what he or she is going to get in the next year or the next six months or whatever the time may be I think therefore that the certificate system oftentimes is an actual benefit in that fact that it does allow people to go into col lege without a condition when perhaps they would be conditioned if they took an examination I throw out these two points merely Mr President There are multitudes of things which doubtless come to us all in the matter but others will wish perhaps to speak THE PRESIDENT The President will point out some of the difficulties which embarrass the way of one who wishes to studyTHE SCHOOL REVIEW this subject In the first place in New England we have no system of really examining the condition of the secondary schools therefore the experiment of certificates is tried under the most disadvantageous possible circumstances When it was first introduced into this country an argument was made in favor of it from the German practice secondary schools in Germany giving an outgoing certificate valid at the university A fatal defect in the argument was that the German secondary schools are supervised by competent government educational authori ties ours by none In New England we have nothing more than an occasional friendly visit to some schools by some col lege officer That is an extremely weak and imperfect method though perhaps better than nothing We are therefore trying the certificate system under the worst possible conditions The public or a student of this subject like myself cannot get the facts which are necessary to an understanding of the working of either the certificate or the examination method At Harvard we publish every year the number of rejections at our examina tions the percentage of rejections the number of rejections in every subject in which we examine and the percentage of rejec tion in every subject in which we examine I know no other institution in this country which does this Yet this publicity is necessary to secure for a student of the subject the results of the experience of large numbers of institutions Without publicity we cannot get evidence of the working of these two systems Again as soon as a New England college puts the certificate system at work freely it ceases to have any useful observation of the examination method and consequently its officers gradually fall into the state of mind of Professor Lord who thinks it a merit of the certificate system that it admits people clear invariably We could easily accomplish that without having either examination or certificate Moreover as Mr Ramsay has already pointed out in a college which really works on the certificate plan none but the refuse students are admitted on examination Of course all comparison in such colleges between the men or women admitted on certificates and those admitted on examination is absolutely useless as has 6IoN A ASSOCIA TION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARA TOR Y SCHOOLS 6 already been pointed out here and as has been pointed out in former discussions There is not the slightest use of asking in a college which really works on the certificate plan which stu dents turn out best the certificated or the examined Of course it is the certificated I mention these things to show the difficulties under which a real student of this subject labors in New England or in the United States at large Moreover the certificate system in New England is not tried under conditions which an advocate of an examination system would think fair Why not  Because the certificate system in New England is tried in presence of the examinations main tained by Harvard Yale and Bowdoin and the certificate sys tem working in the presence of those examinations is I venture to think a totally different thing from what a universal certificate system would prove to be The strict examinations maintained by those colleges in New England which still use the examination methods solely greatly affect the results of the certificate system As I heard President Carter of Williams say years ago We like our certificate system well enough but we dont know what on earth would happen to it if Harvard and Yale should adopt the certificate system I think therefore that a real student of this problem labors in New England or even in the United States under very serious difficulties which not even the excellent report to which we have just listened can remove I hope there are ladies or gentlemen here present who can point out how the field of this inquiry can be better cultivated THE FEDERATION OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS PROFESSOR WILLIAM MACDONALD Bowdoin College I am aware Mr President that it is seldom well to begin ones remarks with an apology or a disclaimer I think I ought to say however that the title assigned to my paper is somewhat more ambitious than the substance of the paper warrants I did meditate a very ambitious paper indeed but it seemed on the whole better to devote the main part of the paper to a particu lar phase of the subject which seemed to me of special interest

j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1011781,The Fourth International Conference of the American States,i242616,THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE AMERICAN STATES1 BY HON HENRY WHITE Chairman of the American Delegation to the Fourth International Confer ence of the American States The promotion of friendship and closer relations with Latin America is not a new subject to me On the contrary it is one the vast importance of which to our interests and to those of the countries in question I have long realized and its importance will be immeasurably increased with the opening of the Panama Canal For years past I have availed myself of every opportunity to cul tivate the friendship of the diplomatic representatives accredited from the other American republics to the country in which I hap pened for the time being to represent the United States and to make them feel that they shared with me the honor of representing America as a whole The result of this was not only the creation of a strong feeling of American solidarity among us all the moral effect of which was beneficial to our respective interests in the particular foreign country to which we were accredited but it also enabled me to realize how earnestly all the best elements in the dif ferent countries of LatinAmerica desire closer relations with the United States and the chief obstacles which exist to the complete realization of that desire It is deeply to be regretted that those vast fields for lucrative investment to the south of usparticularly in the far Southhave unfortunately attracted little or no attention among our own people and it is a source of delight and satisfaction to me which I can but inadequately express to realize that at last we have begun to turn our attention as a nation to this most important subject and that representatives of distinguished commercial bodies from all sections of the country are here in conference assembled to discuss it seriously Well gentlemen greatly as the importance of our relations with countries to the south of us had previously impressed itself Address delivered at the PanAmerican Commercial Conference Washington D C February 17 1911 585The Annals of the American Academy upon me that impression was strengthened a hundred fold by my visit last summer to those two great countries of the far South Argentina and Chile I wish I could give this assembly an adequate idea of the com plete harmony that prevailed and feeling of American solidarity in the deliberations of that great Parliament of America the Pan American Conference at Buenos Ayres which sat for over seven weeks and in which not a single unkind or unfriendly word was uttered from beginning to end of the desire manifested by all other delegates to fall in as far as possible with the views of their col leagues from the United States and of the warm personal friend ship established which as far as I am concerned will be lasting between each and every delegate to the conference You will however shortly have in your hands the report to the Secretary of State of our delegation to the late Buenos Ayres conference and I would suggest that every member of this confer ence read the allusions to our country made in the opening and clos ing speeches of the two Argentine Ministers of Foreign Affairs who successively held office during the sessions of the conference and also the speeches of the President of the conference himself on the days of its opening and of its close I may add that similar sentiments were expressed by the Chilean President and Minister of Foreign Affairs during the official visit which our delegates made as a special embassy to the hundredth anniversary of Chiles independence in speeches which they made on our arrival and departure But perhaps the most interesting feature of the conference and the most important to usnext to the harmony and friendship which characterized its deliberations was the close friendship which sprang up there between the three great powers of the far South Argentina Brazil and Chileknown with ourselves as the A B C of the conference and the way in which they availed them selves of every opportunity to show their friendship separately and collectively for our country Neither of the three ever voted otherwise than as our delegation did We always voted firstby the conferences arrangement not oursand the other three voted in the order mentioned immediately after us and on the whole there was very little voting against those four delegations Whatever may be said or written to the contrary by those 586 8Fourth International Conference of American States whose interest it is to promote discord between the countries of LatinAmerica and ourselves I have no hesitation in asserting that those great powers of the South have no longer any fear of our wishing to obtain territorial extension at their expense or at the expense of any other country or of our aspiring to any other undue advantage over them and they sympathize fully with the efforts our government is making to improve conditions in Central America It is to my mind of the greatest advantage to all America and to this country particularly that there should be at the southern end of our hemisphere three important powers in complete sympathy with each other and with ourselves and anxious to develop trade re lations to the greatest possible extent with us Those great countries are above all things desirous that our merchants should come there and do business with theirs and they cannot understand why we should so long have neglected the opportunities they offer us and should have left them entirely in the hands of other great commercial countries Not only Great Britain which has been investing for more than a century in the Argentine Republic and other American countries has I was credibly informed 2500000000 of dollars invested in the former alone producing an average annual return of at least IO but Ger many Italy France and other countriesthe first particularly are doing likewise A firstclass passenger and freight steamer arrives nearly every day at Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Ayres from one European port or another There are a number of British German Italian and other foreign banks in those and other Latin American cities and what is perhaps most important of all the citizens of the countries named go to LatinAmerica themselves or send fellow citizens in whom they have confidence knowing the language of those countriesand attend in person or through such fellow citizens to their own business And in this connection I venture to appeal to those present here today to urge every youth and young man upon whom they have any influence to learn the Spanish and if possible one or two other languages particularly French and German But how is it with usthe nation of all others whose influence should be felt in those countries Not a single American bank in Buenos Ayres or Santiago the official representatives of our coun try having to cash their drafts on the Treasurer of the United 587 9The Annals of the American Academy States through a British or other bank via some European city One direct passenger steamer a month from New York to Buenos Ayres and intermediate ports on the east coast of South America taking about twentyfive days for the voyage and another requir ing a change of steamers at Rio in about the same time and those two ships under the flag of another country In addition to this scarcely an American is to be found per manently representing American business interests in Buenos Ayres even the sale of the machines of one of the greatest of our agri cultural machine manufacturers being in the hands of an agent not of our own nationality who also sells similar machines from his own country Can that man be blamed if he gives the preference to the machines of the country from which he hails and only sells ours when they are asked for Of course not And I could if time allowed give many similar instances of the way in which we have been positively inviting other great countries to take the lions share of these wonderful opportunities for investment an invitation of which they have certainly not been slow to avail themselves The whole situation is simply incredible to anyone who has not actually been there and seen it for himself I have however de rived much consolation during the past few days from the knowl edge that the head of one of our large business firms has been re cently himself to the Argentine and Chile and has secured a tenyear contract the largest ever made I am told for the supply of his particular commodity in any foreign country and I hope when the particulars of this transaction become known I am not at present allowed to mention names and especially when the voluminous returns which are certain to result from this investment begin to be realized that other fellow citizens of ours will follow this admirable example in constantly increasing numbers Gentlemen I am not a statistician and if I were I should not permit myself to take up your time today with a series of figures to show how much we are losing annually by the policy we have hitherto pursued in respect to commercial intercourse with South America I would merely say that in my opinion there is but one way and one way onlyby which that intercourse can be placed on a proper footing and that is by ships of our own such as the other great commercial countries of the world who now practically 588 IOFourth International Confercnce of American States monopolize the trade with South America have By ships I mean firstclass fast passenger and freight carrying steamers flying our own flag between our ports and those of Central and South America Nothing can be more derogatory to our dignity and to our interests in those countries than the fact that our flag is never seen there on merchant steamers This statement some persons may consider sentimental I can assure you that it is not but eminently practical there being no question as to the fact that we pay an enor mous sum to other nationsI understand upwards of 300000000 annuallyfor the privilege of carrying our oversea commerce In comparison any subsidy that could be imagined would be the merest trifle quite apart from the fact that under present con ditions we are contributing largely toward the increase and main tenance of the merchant marine of other countries which must at least be useless to us and might be hostile in the event of war For this reason I cannot help deeply regretting the fate which seems likely to befall in Congress the bill popularly known as the Gallinger Ship Subsidy Bill providing moderate subsidies for steamers of not less than sixteen knots running between our ports and those of Central and South America It was only passed in the Senate by the Vice Presidents casting vote and will I am told be defeated in the House of Representatives I am wholly unconnected with any business interests and consequently with any shipping interests having devoted the past twentyeight years of my life solely to the diplomatic service of the United States I am neither for nor against subsidies and am in clined on general principles to be against them rather than in their favor But I am for ships merchant ships under the American flag between ports of this country and the rest of America and if we cannot get these ships otherwise than by subsidies then I am for subsidies or for any other measures that will give us means of com munication with our sister republics The size and speed of the steamers which the European com mercial powers are sending to South America are being steadily increased and the Italians have now two or three new ones averag ing eighteen knots an hour With such ships the voyage from New York or other ports of the United States to Buenos Ayres could be performed in less than fourteen days and to Brazil in about eleven 589 IIThe Annals of the American Academy days In order to get the American delegation to the PanAmer ican Conference under our own flag the government had to send us out in an army transport which averaging only eleven knots took twentyone days for the voyage Nations are like individuals they cannot become intimate with each other unless their respective citizens meet from time to time and exchange views in personal intercourse Still less are they likely to trade freely and to have confidence in each other save under those circumstances On the other hand they are not unlikely to drift apart and become suspicious of each other if they never do meet and the only way in which the people of the countries south of us are likely to come to us or ours to go freely to them is on good fast steamships At present the only comfortable way of making the voyage is via Europe Nothing can be more interesting and remarkable than the man ner in which the Germans during the brief period of their existence as a great nation and particularly of late years have realized that it is by merchant ships of their own carrying their goods all over the world in exchange for other goods which they bring home rather than by colonies that their influence can be most advan tageously and profitably exercised throughout the world They are consequently competing most successfully by means of their fine merchant steamers which they do not hesitate to subsidize when ever desirable for the trade of South America with all the other powers now engaged therein And I say this in no spirit of hostil ity but on the contrary with the greatest admiration for the man ner in which that great nation has realized from the first the best way of extending its influence and of increasing its wealth and has allowed no question of expense or any other obstacle to stand in the way of the attainment of those objects which are not only legitimate but of vital importance for every nation Even the Japanese who are not supposed to be a wealthy nation but are a very marvelous and intelligent nation have realized also the im portance of the South and Central American trade and are begin ning to compete for that of the West coast with a line of subsidized merchant steamers and very good steamers they are too running to Salina Cruz in Mexico thence to Callao and from there to Valparaiso returning to Japan by the same route I cannot believe that we are the only nation unable to have 590 12Fourth Intcrnational Conference of American States ships wherewith to compete for our share of that great commerce which is particularly within our own sphere and should be ours any more than I can believe that we are the only great nation of the world which cannot have a sound monetary systema system whereby our periodical financial panics which are the laughing stock of the world and bring ruin to thousands of our citizens would be avoided and whereby if we had such a system as I believe we shall have before long this country would become the financial center of the world I would therefore urge the great commercial bodies of the country whose representatives are here today and those who are not represented also to bring all possible pressure to bear upon members of Congress from their respective districts with a view to turning their attention to the restoration of our merchant marine at least to the seas between our ports and those of Central and South America whether by subsidies or otherwise I care not so long as we have the ships But ships we must have or resign ourselves to becoming a tributary nation in so far as our ocean borne trade is concerned to those who carry it for us I suppose that no one here doubts that foreigners carry our products on terms most advantageous to themselves and not to us and in their own way If however Congress has not seen its way to the restoration of our merchant marine in American waters I am happy to say that that distinguished body took a step last week of farreaching im portance to our commercial interests for which it deserves all possible credit I refer to the bill which was passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives for the purchase of houses for our embassies legations and consulates in foreign countries I have trespassed too long upon the time of this assembly to venture upon a dissertation upon the importance to the further ance of our commerce particularly of that measure but I am happy from the point of view of our relations commercial and otherwise with our sister republics of America to find that the provisions of this Act of Congress are such as practically to compel our government to limit its scope at present to those particular coun tries in which it is of greater importance even than elsewhere that we own without a moments further delay our official buildings I understand but have not yet seen the Act since its passage 591 I3The Annals of the American Academy that no more than I5oooo can be spent under its provisions upon any one building It will be perfectly possible to obtain commodious and suitable buildings within that limit in every South and Central American capital except Buenos Ayres where it will not be pos sible to do so owing to the enormous rise during the last year or two in the price of land in the best sections of that city and to the great expense there of building and of everything else And here I should just like to say a word about the stress which has been laid during discussions on this subject in Congress in the press and elsewhere for many years past upon the alleged impossibility for an ambassador or minister with little or no pri vate means of living in a house costing 150000 200000 or 300000 or whatever the amount may be It never seems to have occurred to those raising that question that the cost of a house depends entirely upon the place in which it is situated In the best residential districts of New York a house costing 5000ooo would be a small one so would such a house be in similar districts of Buenos Ayres London Paris Berlin Vienna Rome or St Petersburg where houses of moderate size cost upwards of 300000 and even 400000 according to the price of the land on which they are built and to other local conditions The main point is to have a house of suitable size for our foreign representative to inhabit so that he shall not be dependent upon the rapacity of local land lords or have to spend the whole of his salary upon his house rent as is the case with our present minister to the Argentine Mr Sher rill who has rendered invaluable service to our commercial and other interests in that country He not only has had to do this but has been turned out of the house in the middle of his term of office because the landlord wanted it for himself and the same thing has frequently happened to our ambassadors in the great capitals of Europe Our present ambassador to Italy has so far been unable to find any residence at all owing to the overcrowded condition of Rome and is living in a hotel which is eminently derogatory to the dignity of the country he represents and constitutes a situation against which other great countries protect themselves by owning their em bassy houses This is a subject upon which I have felt most deeply ever since my early youth when my national pride was humiliated upon going 592 14Fourth International Conference of American States to Paris just after the Civil War and seeing the dignified manner in which the other great Powers house their embassies and legations while all that we could call a legation in those days consisted of a few rooms up three flights of stairs over a corner grocery store I still hardly dare trust myself to speak of it But fortunately it is unnecessary any longer to do so as Congress has at last taken steps to remedy the humiliation Suffice it to say that nations as is the case with individuals are respected by others precisely to the extent to which such nations cause the impression to prevail that they respect them selves Nothing produces an impression of national selfrespect so com pletely in foreign countries or tends so much to the development of a nations commerce with the exception of a powerful navy as dignified provision for the housing of its official representatives in such countries and a merchant marine carrying its wares under its own flag to the uttermost parts of the earth We have had a powerful navy for some time past We shall soon be housing our representatives and the valuable archives under their charge as other great nations do theirs And I would appeal earnestly to every commercial body in this country to see that we get a merchant marine before the opening of the great international waterway at Panama that work of Herculean magnitude which it will soon have been the glory of our country to contribute to the promotion of international commerce and to the immeasurable bene fit of mankind 593 I5

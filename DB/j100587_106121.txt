of an Astro nomical Clock By the Rev Francis Wollaston F R S H A V I N G heard it often lamented that very few registers of the going of clocks have been communicated to the public I take the liberty to lay before the Society such obser vations as I have made to ascertain mine and shall be happy if my amusements can in any way be of the least service to any one Read Dec 19 1771 My clock was made by Holmes The pendulum rod is of deal to which the ball is screwed fast and it is adjusted by a smaller weight underneath The clock beats dead seconds and is fastened to a prin cipal wall independent of the floor The room never has a fire in it The transit telescope with which I made the ob servations has an achromatic object glass of only 14 inches focal length and magnifies about 15 times its transverse axis is but 12 inches long and it is mounted on a vertical axis of 18 being designed for an equal altitude instrument likewise and so used  in560 in some of the following observations It is fastened to a large stone pillar bedded on the wall of the house and is adjusted in the meridian to a mark 700 feet distant I mention these particulars because the observations shew that even so small an instrument is capable of tolerable exactness and it is for that reason I have set down the result of all the transits I have taken for a year past though much fewer would have sufficed for shewing the rate of the clock The observations themselves are not here because I would not trouble the Society with such a detail else they should readily have had them It can be of no service to falsify calculations which might have been withheld and I believe to the best of my abilities these are done accurately I am sure they are delivered faithfully The 1 st and 2d columns require no explanation The third shews how much the clock proved to be  or too fast  or too slow for mean solar time upon each observation when it came to be calculated afterwards The marks or are set down as any one appeared to me to be more or less doubtful at the time of observing The calculations will shew which are really most to be suspected The fourth column shews how much the clock varied per day when compared with the preceeding observation of the same object The small variations in these are owing probably to errors in observing rather than to the clock itself I do not pretend in observing to distinguish nearer than to half a second though the calculations are set down in decimals In561 In the middle of February when the first change was the frost was intense and the pendulum did not for some days throwout so far by about 7 as it generally did which was about 10 37on one side and 10 40 on the other At the change in August I observed no difference It appears by these trials as if the clock gained in warm and lost in cooler weather but this is not clear It began to gain before the weather grew warm Whether this be owing to damp or any other causes longer experience and abler observers may discover VOL LXI 4 C 1770562 Clock Varies from Clock Varies 1770  too fast mean time 1771  too fast prday  too slow per day  too slow        Nov 1  Pegasi Cl  05  Jan 10 Rigel Cl1 437 22

THE REVERNED MR WILLIAM DERHAM TO THE PUBLISHER CONCERNING AN INSECT THAT IS COMMONLY CALLED THE DEATHWATCH UPMINSTER JULY 21 1701 S I R I CONFESS I AM NOT SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH BOOKS WHICH TREAT OF INSECTS TO KNOW WHETHER THE ACCOUNT WHICH I NOW SEND YOU CONCERNING DEATHWATCHES BE A NOVELTY OR NOT THE NAME OF DEATHWATCHES IS COM MON ENOUGH AND THEIR NOISE TERRIBLE TO MANY WHO LOOK UPON IT AS THE SOUND OF THE DREADFUL MESSENGER OF DEATH LITTLE IMAGINING IT TO BE ONLY A SPORTIVE EXERCISE OF A VERY COMMON INSECT OF THESE DEATHWATCHES OR INSECTS WHICH MAKE A NOISE LIKE THE BEATS OF A WATCH I HAVE OBSERVED TWO SORTS ONE OF THEM I FIND A VERY EXACT AND TRUE ACCOUNT OF IN PHILOS TRANS NO 245 THE INSECT THERE DESCRIBED BEING LESS SHY AND MUCH BIGGER THAN THE OTHER I DISCOVERED SOME YEARS AGO THIS YEAR I CAUGHT MANY IN MAY IN MY STUDY TWO OF WHICH A MALE AND FEMALE I KEPT ALIVE IN A LITTLE BOX ABOUT 3 WEEKS AND COULD MAKE ONE OF THEM BEAT WHENEVER I PLEASED BY IMITATING HIS BEATING AT LAST ONE DIED THE OTHER GNAWED HIS WAY OUT THRO THE SIDE OF THE BOX THE REASON WHY I JUDGE THESE TO BE MALE AND FEMALE IS BECAUSE I HAVE OFTEN BY MY TICKING NOISE INVITED THE MALE TO GET UP UPON THE OTHER IN WAY OF COITION THAT WHICH I TOOK TO BE THE MALE WAS SOMEWHAT LESSER THAN THE OTHER AND WAS MOST FREE IN ANSWERING MY BEATS BE FORE HE GOT UPON THE OTHER HE WOULD BEAT VERY EAGERLY AND WHEN HE FOUND THAT HE WAS GOT UP IN VAIN HE WOULD GET OFF AND BEAT AGAIN EAGERLY AND THEN UP AGAIN FROM WHENCE I GUESS THESE PULSATIONS TO BE THE WAY WHEREBY THESE INSECTS WOOE ONE ANOTHER AND FIND OUT AND INVITE EACH OTHER TO COPULATION THIS MR ALLEN HATH TAKEN NO NOTICE OF IN HIS AFORENAMED RELA833 RELATION AND THEREFORE I PRESUME TO ADD IT TO HIS ACCURATE ACCOUNT FROM WHICH I DIFFER ONLY IN WHAT HE SAYS CON CERNING THE PART WITH WHICH THE TICKING NOISE IS MADE WHICH HE SAYS IS THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE FACE WHICH MAY BE CALLED THE UPPERLIP BUT I OBSERVED THE INSECT ALWAYS TO DRAW BACK ITS MOUTH AND BEAT WITH ITS FOREHEAD THE OTHER DEATHWATCH IS AN INSECT IN APPEARANCE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST WHICH I LATELY DISCOVERED ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THIS JULY THE OTHER DEATHWATCH BEAT ETH ONLY ABOUT 7 OR 8 STROKES AT A TIME AND QUICKER BUT THIS WILL BEAT SOME HOURS TOGETHER WITHOUT INTERMISSION AND HIS STROKES ARE MORE LEISURELY AND LIKE THE BEATS OF A WATCH I HAVE SEVERAL YEARS OBSERVED THESE TWO SORTS OF BEATING BUT TOOK IT TO BE MADE BY ONE AND THE SAME ANI MAL THE INSECT WHICH MAKES THIS LONG BEATING IS A SMALL GREYISH INSECT MUCH RESEMBLING A LOUSE WHEN LOOKED ON ONLY WITH THE NAKED EYE FOR WHICH REASON FOR WANT OF ANOTHER NAME I CALL IT PEDICULUS PULSATORIUS IT IS VE RY NIMBLE IN RUNNING TO SEEK ITS SHELTER WHEN DISTURBED IT IS VERY COMMON IN ALL PARTS OF THE HOUSE IN THE SUM MER MONTHS THEY ARE EXTREMELY SHY OR BEATING WHEN DISTURBED BUT WILL BEAT FREELY ENOUGH BEFORE YOU AND ALSO ANSWER YOU WHEN YOU BEAT IF YOU CAN VIEW THEM WITHOUT GIVING THEM DISTURBANCE OR SHAKING THE PLACE WHERE THEY LYE C I CANNOT TELL WHETHER THEY BEAT IN ANY OTHER THING BU I HAVE HEARD THEIR NOISE ONLY IN OR NEAR PAPER CONCERNING THEIR NOISE I AM SOMEWHAT IN DOUBT WHE THER IT BE MADE BY BEATING THEIR HEADS OR RATHER SNOUTS AGAINST THE PAPER OR WHETHER IT BE NOT MADE AFTER SOME SUCH MANNER AS GRASHOPPERS AND CRICKETS MAKE THEIR NOISE I RATHER INCLINE TO THE FORMER OPINION BUT MY REASON OF DOUBTING IS BECAUSE I HAVE OBSERVED THE ANIMALS BODY TO SHAKE OR GIVE A SUDDEN JIRK AT EVERY STROKE BUT I COULD SCARCE PERCEIVE ANY PART OF ITS BODY TO TOUCH THE PAPER TIS POSSIBLE IT MIGHT BEAT THE PAPER AND I NOT PERCEIVE IT BY REASON ITS BODY IS SMALL AND NEAR THE PAPER WHEN INFERREDITINFERRED834 IT BEATETH AND ITS MOTION IN BEATING IS SUDDEN AND SWIFT FOR WHICH REASONS ALSO IT IS HARD TO PERCEIVE THE INSECT TO BEAT WITHOUT A VERY SEVERE EYE AND THEREFORE I MADE USE OF A CONVEXGLASS WHICH BY MAGNIFYING GAVE ME MUCH BETTER OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING THIS TICKING NOISE I JUDGE AS BEFORE A WOOING ACT BY REASON I OBSERVED ANOTHER AFTER MUCH BEATING TO COME AND MAKE OFFERS TO THE BEATING INSECT WHO AFTER SOME OFFERS LEFT OFF HIS BEATING AND GOT UP UPON THE BACK OF THAT OTHER WHEN THEY HAD CONJOYNED HE GOT OFF AGAIN AND THEY CONTINUED SOME HOURS JOYNED TAIL TO TAIL LIKE DOG AND BITCH IN COITION THE FEMALE WHICH I SAW WAS SOMEWHAT BIGGER THAN THE MALE AND LIGHTER IN COLOUR INCLINING TO A YELLOW BUT WHETHER ALL ARE SO I KNOW NOT I HAVE OFTEN HERETOFORE BY THE NOISE PURSUED THE MAKERS OF IT BUT HAVE THOUGHT MY SELF DISAPPOINTED WHEN I FOUND NOTHING BUT SOME OF THESE PEDICULI WHICH I DID NOT PERCEIVE TO BEAT AND WHICH I LITTLE IMAGINED COULD HAVE MADE SO SONOROUS A NOISE AS I HAVE HEARD SOME OF THEM DO EVEN AS LOUD ALMOST AS THE STRONGEST BEATS OF A POCKETWATCH BUT LATELY FINDING A PIECE OF PAPER IN MY STUDY IN WHICH I WAS SURE THE BEATING WAS AND IT BEING LUCKILY LOOSELY FOLDED SO AS TO BE VIEWED THROUGHOUT AND ALSO HAPPENING TO LIE IN A GOOD LIGHT I STRICTLY VIEW ED IT BUT COULD ONLY SEE SOME OF THOSE PEDICULI AND VIEWING THEM WITH A CONVEXGLASS I SOON PERCEIVED SOME OF THEM TO BEAT OR TO MAKE A NOISE WITH A SUDDEN SHAKE OF THEIR BODY AS HATH BEEN DESCRIBED AND I AM NOW SO USED TO AND SKILFUL IN THE MATTER AS TO BE ABLE TO SEE AND SHEW THEIR BEATING ALMOST WHEN I PLEASE BY HAVING A PAPER WITH SOME OF THEM IN IT CONVENIENTLY PLACED AND IMITATING THEIR PULSATIONS WHICH THEY WILL READILY ANSWER WHETHER THIS INSECT CHANGETH ITS SHAPE AND BECOMETH ANY OTHER ANIMAL I KNOW NOT BUT I HAVE SOME CAUSE THO VERY LITTLE TO SUSPECT THAT IT BECOMETH A SORT OF FLY II THE

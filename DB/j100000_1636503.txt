ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING A DANGER ARISING FROM THE POPULAR IZATION OF THE COLLEGE1 I WISH to speak of a danger which threat ens the American college as the result of changes in the work of the college and in its environment whose joint effect may be summed up in the phrase the populariza tion of the college The history of the American college be gins about the close of the first third of the seventeenth century Harvard Col lege having been founded in 1637 The traditional college curriculum which was not radically changed till about the middle of the nineteenth century was largely due to the intellectual conditions of the seven teenth century When Harvard College was founded there was very little to be studied beyond the rudiments of a com mon English education excepting Latin Greek and Hebrew and a little mathe matics At that very time Descartes was shaping the outlines of the method of co ordinates in geometry but the world had still to wait half a century for the inven tion of the calculus A halfcentury was to elapse before Newtons great discovery of gravitation gave unity to the conception of the universe Almost a century and a half was to pass away before the discover ies of Priestley and Lavoisier created the science of chemistry The Systema Na turae of Linnaeus did not appear until Harvard College was already a century old A century and a half was to elapse before geology and paleontology took 1Address given before the Section of Education of the American Association for the Advancement of Science shape under the hands of Hutton and Cuvier It was almost a century and a half before Adam Smiths Wealth of Na tions laid the foundations of the moderml study of economics It was more than halk a century before Lockes Essay on thie Human Understanding opened the dis cussions of the modern period of philoso phy More than two centuries were to elapse before the study of language took on a scientific form in Grimms Ge schichte der deutschen Sprache Two editions had already appeared of the col lected plays of Shakespeare but as yet no one dreamed of English literature as standing on a par with the great classic literatures as an object of study and still less would it have occurred to any English speaking educator to think of the litera ture of any other modern language as a worthy object of study The ancient languages and a little mathematics formed about all the educational material that was accessible in the seventeenth century and it was nothing strange that the curriculum developed in the environment of that age survived for a considerable time after the environment had changed But the old curriculum has now become thoroughly extinct The new branches of learning which have developed in the last three cen turies have come to take a dominant posi tion in the education of youth as in the thought of manhood The wealth of edu cational material at present available is vastly larger than any one can deal with in the brief years of the college course Everywhere the fixed curriculum has given place to the elective system With the recognition that the field of learning is so large that no one can secure even an intro duction to all departments of it in the col lege course the elective system has be come a practical necessity From the vast variety of attractive and useful studies each student is rightly left to select in 372 SCIENCEMARChI 5 1909 large measure according to his own idio syncrasies tastes and professional plans  ith this change in the studies of the ollege course has been associated a change nthe constituency of the college In erlier days the fixed curriculum of the c llege was supposed rightly or wrongly to b adapted to furnish the best substratum fpr the subsequent professional training ot men who were dedicated to the three pursuits known as the learned profes sionsthe ministry the law and medi cine The members of these professions formed a sharply defined intellectual aristocracy Membership in that aristoc racy was in large degree hereditary The members of these professions consti tuted what Dr Holmes has felicitously called the Brahmin caste in the Ameri can society of earlier days For those boys who were not destined for the learned professions and for all girls the training of the common schools in the three Rs was supposed to be allsufficient Today there is no such Brahmin caste The aristocratic constitution of society has changed to one which is intellectually as well as politically democratic The acad emies and high schools teach the rudiments of the new learning to boys and girls who have no aspiration for any specially learned professions but who are to do the common work of men and women in so ciety In the changes which have passed over society new professions have de veloped which rival the old learned pro fessions in their demand for advanced in tellectual training The work of the teacher has been evolved into a distinct profession instead of being merely an inci dental and temporary employment for persons who were ultimately to pass into other walks of life The applications of science in the various useful arts have created a demand for advanced intellec tual training on the part of multitudes of men who are destined not to lives of scho lastic seclusion but to lives whose business is with the concrete realities of the mate rial world There is no sharp distinction between a learned class and an unlearned mass there is rather an indefinite grada tion from the most educated to the least educated members of the community Now that the sciences of nature the mod ern languages and literatures history eco nomics and sociology have assumed a domi nant position in the college course the college attracts to itself a much wider and more varied constituency Not alone the devotees of the ancient learned professions but multitudes of those who are going into the variety of pursuits embraced under the general name of business throng to the college and find there instruction and training which will fit them for larger views of their own calling and for broader service as citizens The college commu nity has become relatively heterogeneous Precisely herein lies the danger to which I have thought it worth while to call your attention In the olden time it was as sumed that every student in college was dedicated to a distinctively intellectual pursuit His life was to be a scholarly life Hence a scholarly aim more or less definitely conceived and more or less con sistently maintained during the college course was expected on the part of all Now a large share of college students are looking to something very different from a life of learned seclusion They are to be in the busy world of affairs they are to develop the material wealth of the com munity The careers for which they are intending to fit themselves will demand in tellectual vigor and in many cases a con siderable degree of special knowledge but they are not careers that would naturally be called scholarly Hence there comes a pressure exerted upon college faculties to tolerate a lower standard in the scholastic SCIENCE 373N S VOL XXIX No 740 work of the college on the ground that a large part of the young men enrolled in the college have no intention of giving themselves to scholarly pursuits and can not be reasonably expected to have a scholarly spirit The trouble is not simply that some men do not study That was always the fact No system ever fulfills its own ideal and in the old days when it was supposed that all students were pre paring to be scholars the supposition was very far from being exactly in accordance with the reality But then the men who did not study knew and confessed that they ought to study Now it is gravely as serted in influential quarters that many students in college ought not to study to any very great extent and ought not to be expected to study that as they are never intending to be scholars there is no need of their being particularly scholarly even during their school life Precisely on this ground then there is a pressure not only on the part of friends of particular stu dents but also on the part of influential alumni and alumni clubs and associations to admit men who are unprepared to toler ate men who are neglecting their work and to graduate men who have accom plished very little in the line of study Especially is such a pressure exerted in behalf of men who are distinguishing themselves as athletes during their school and college life and in behalf of men who are likely to come into possession of con siderable money In urging the claims of such men for peculiarly lenient treatment in college it is seriously maintained that it is a good thing for men who are going into business or any other pursuit not distinctly scholastic in character to go to college with no intention of doing any considerable amount of studying and to be graduated without having done any considerable amount of studying It is urged that if they spend the four years essentially in the avocations of student lifeathletics social events amusements college politicsand in the occasional in tervals of leisure which these exhausting avocations may afford study enough tot pass examinations and to be graduated speciali gratia they will yet absorb from the general atmosphere of the college an influence in the direction of increasing breadth of view and higher ideals in lifa which will be worth the cost in time and money I do not believe that this view finds much support among college facul ties but I do believe that continual pres sure in this direction actually tends to se cure the admission of men with lower standards of preparation and the gradua tion of men with lower standards of schol arly achievement than would otherwise be tolerated The whole position seems to me radically wrong The business of a stu dent is to study and for the individual student to spend the four years in the vocation and to devote the bulk of his continual and systematic neglect of his time and mental energy to the avocations of student activities is essentially de moralizing He leaves college with a weakened sense of responsibility and a conscience which has grown increasingly tolerant of selfindulgence He has suf fered a distinct loss in those elements of strength of character which qualify a man for noble achievement in any department of human life If the evil effect were confined to the individuals directly concerned it would be less serious than it actually is for a class of men who are in college not to study but for other purposes exerts an influence upon the college body in the direction of degradation of scholarship and deterioration of character Especially strong is this evil influence if the men concerned possess athletic ability wealth attractive manners and amiable social 374 SCIENCEMARCH 5 1909 SCIENCE qualities which result in their being recog nized as social leaders Besides the general pressure in the di tection of leniency as regards the stand lrds of admission and graduation the iotion that it is desirable to fill up our olleges with a class of students who have serious ambition to study has created Wa tendency to the more liberal admission oif students on special courses I think there would be substantially unanimous agreement among college faculties in the belief that there ought to be some persons admitted as special students The oppor tunities of instruction which a college af fords can without any detriment to those who are taking regular courses leading to a degree be afforded to certain classes of students whose age financial condition or other circumstances may make it entirely impracticable for them to complete the col lege curriculum Teachers in high schools and similar institutions can often get leave of absence for a year or for a part of a year and improve the time in earnest study in college in a department in which they are teaching and in which they have already attained a proficiency which fits them to take advanced work in college Men and women engaged in various pro fessional or technical pursuits may in like manner gain very much by special courses in the colleges in lines of study connected with their work In such cases though the persons may not have completed any of the prescribed courses of preparation for college they are yet fitted by maturity of age definiteness of purpose and thorough training along some lines of study or intellectual work to take up the studies of some departments with great ad vantage to themselves and with positive benefit rather than loss to the college It is sometimes justifiable to admit as special students those who wish to take a some what general course of study similar to that which would be required for the bachelors degree but whose preliminary schooling has been irregular and who have not covered exactly any prescribed course for admission to college though the aggre gate of training which they have received may be equal in amount or even superior to that which would fit them for admission to college This is the case sometimes with those who have commenced professional or technical studies and subsequently awake to the necessity of gaining more of general education In some cases it is legitimate to admit as special students candidates who are expected eventually to get into a regular course of study and take a degree But to smuggle into college under the name of special students candi dates who have simply made a failure of the preparatory course through lack of ability or through lack of industry is an evasion which can not be practised without demoralization of the college But there are probably very few administrative officers or committees having charge of the admission of students to college to whom the outside pressure for the practise of such evasions has not come to be a familiar experience The principle must be explicitly af firmed and consistently and at times sternly maintained in practise that how ever widely diversified may be the college course under the operation of the elective system and however cordially men and women preparing for careers widely dif ferent from those involved in the tradi tional learned professions may be welcomed to college only those students are welcome who come to studywho feel the genuine vocation of the student and in whose plans for the years of college life the avocations of student life are to be distinctly subor dinate to the great vocation Within limits by no means narrow they may study what they please they may shape their 375N S VOL XXIX No 740 course very largely with reference to the nonscholastic pursuits which await them after leaving college if they do not want to study Greek they may study French or German or Spanish they may study ap plications of science as well as pure science if they do not want to study phi losophy or advanced mathematics they may study the labor problem or banking and currency or commercial geography and commercial law only let it be under stood that whatever they profess to study they

for a society in which students of all branches of paleontology can unite for the promotion of their common interests Such an organization has now been effected as a section of the Geological Society of America under the name of  The Paleon tological Society The preliminary correspondence which was begun by Professor Charles Schuchert of Yale University early last year was inspired by the successful meeting of the American Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists in New Haven This correspondence developed the fact that nearly 60 paleontologists are ready to unite in a general society and of these 34 attended the first meeting for organization in Baltimore on December 30 1908 At this meeting an Executive Committee consisting of Charles Schuchert F B Loomis S W Williston David White H F Osborn and T W Stanton was appointed with full power to act for the society On February 13 1909 the Executive Com mittee met with a special committee of the Geological Society of America in the Ameri can Museum of Natural History New York City and made a satisfactory adjustment of the relations between the two societies The committee also prepared a constitution and bylaws and elected the following board of officers for the Paleontological Society to serve the remainder of this year PresidentJohn M Clarke First VicepresidentJohn C Merriam Second VicepresidentTimothy W Stanton Third VicepresidentDavid White TreasurerWilliam D Matthew SecretaryHlerdman F Cleland EditorCharles R Eastman It is expected that all the paleontologists of North America will be enrolled in the mem bership

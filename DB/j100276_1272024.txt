SOCIrTIESBENEFICIARIESA bylaw of a mutual benefit association limited the beneficiaries to relations and depen dants of the insured though the statute under which the society was organ ized allowed others to be insured as beneficiaries A became a member and took out a benefit certificate in favor of B or such person or persons as the rules and regulations of said association shall determine B was neither a relation nor a dependant of A this fact being well known to the company On the death of A his only surviving brother and sisters brought suit as his nearest relatives to recover the amount of the benefit certificate B likewise sued for the amount and the association having paid the money into court the claimants interpleaded Held two of the judges dissenting that B was entitled to recover Coulson et al v Flynn et al Igo5  N Y 73 N E Rep 507 Though in this case the statute was broader than the bylaws as to classes of beneficiaries allowed still as the bylaws as well as the statute must be read into the contract and the primary object of these associations taken into consideration it would seem that the dissenting opinion is better supported by reason and authority than that of the majority The holding in the pres ent case seems to be in accord with those cases that hold that where the bene ficiary named is outside the class provided for by the constitution of the association no one but the association can raise the question and it may waive its right Morrison v Mutual Life Insurance Co 59 Wis 162 David son v Mutual Benefit Society 39 Minn 303 Johnson v Knights

she was and had lived with him as such up to the time of his death But the better opinion seems to be that where the person designated as beneficiary is not within any of the statutory classes no waiver by the company will be effective and the fund will go to the person or persons of the class first entitled American Legion of Honor v Perry I40 Mass 580 Shea v Mutual Benefit Associa tion i60

STATUTE The statutes of Wisconsin provided that every life insurance company doing business in this state on the principle of mutual insurance or the members of which are entitled to share in the surplus funds thereof may make distri bution of such surplus as they have cumulated annually or once in two three 587MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW four or five years as the directors thereof may from time to time determine In determining the amount of the surplus to be distributed there shall be reserved an amount not less than the aggregate net value of all the out standing policies In an action brought to enjoin the Commissioner of Insurance from cancelling plaintiffs license in the state it was Held that the law was not violated by the issuance of policies providing for the distribu tion of dividends at periods of ten fifteen and twenty years and the relief asked for was granted Equitable Life Insurance Society of the United States v Host 1905  Wis  102 N W Rep 579 The holding turned on the question whether the word may in the statute should be regarded as mandatory or merely permissive The ground taken by the court is that the purpose of the law was the protection of policy holders by safeguarding against insolvency by providing for the cumulation of a sur plus The defendant on the other hand insisted that the statute was manda tory and that under it plaintiff had no right to defer payment of the dividends for a longer period than five years In a recent case in Illinois cited in the opinion where the statute was practically indentical with that of Wisconsin the same conclusion was reached by the court as in the principal case Roth schild v New York Life Insurance Co 97 Ill App 547 and a similar holding in New York is that in the case of Greef v Equitable Life Assurance Society I60 N Y I9 46 L R A 288 While it is well settled that the word may will be construed to mean shall whenever the public or third persons have a claim that the power ought to be exercised yet the rule of interpretation is not uniform but depends upon what in view of the circumstances appears to have been the true intent of the statute SEDGWICK ON STATUTORY CON STRUCTION p 375

CONSTRUCTION 2nd edition Vol II  640 Notwithstanding the Illinois and New York decisions mentioned it seems that the words of the statute might well be construed as mandatory else why is five years the longest term mentioned It is said in one or more of the cases that the provision allowing annual dividends may be regarded as a limitation for the protection of policy holders against declaring them at shorter intervals Why should not the same manner of construction apply to the longest period mentioned regarding it too as a limitation beyond which dividends shall not be deferred

Publication No 12 of the Board of Administration other wise designated as Bulletin No 6 of the Bureau of Juvenile Research It is a survey of a rural Ohio county made by Mina A Sessions Field Worker for the Bureau of Juvenile Research It aims at an accurate estimate of the number of feebleminded in the county and therefore gives the worker and student a notion of the nature of the people with whom welfare workers have to contend Following are the main points of the Survey 1 The county chosen for the Survey is in the hilly section at the south eastern part of the state bordering the Ohio River 2 On February 15 1916 there were 253 persons in the various state insti tutions from the county studied Of this number under state control 16 were known to be feebleminded but less than 8 were inmates of the Insti tution for the FeebleMinded 3 It was estimated that 47 of the Infirmary population was dependent because of feeblemindedness Only 35 was dependent because of infirmity due to old age or illness 4 There was proportionately five times as much feeblemindedness among the dependent children in the Childrens Home as among the public school children of the county 5 Two district schools were found in each of which more than 40 of the children were feebleminded 6 The proportion of males to females among the feebleminded was as 3 to 2 7 The majority of the feebleminded were descended from pioneer stock 8 The percentage of feebleminded at large in the rural districts was double the percentage in the urban districts 9 Nearly half of the feebleminded at large were being partially sup ported by the public 10 Seventyeight feebleminded persons or 135 of the total feeble minded population of the county belonged to one family strain which has been called the Hickory family 11 Four other families contributed 48 feebleminded persons or 83 of the total feebleminded population of the county 12 Approximately 1 of the total population of the county was found to be feebleminded It is believed that this percentage would not apply to the whole state Other surveys should be made of other representative parts of OhioR H G COURTSLAWS To Provide a Department of State

Good intentions will not make effective legislation intended to be remedial unless it is based upon sound economic laws The provisions of The Ideal AntiLoan Shark Statute are constitutional economically sound and remedial to the borrowing public while fair to legitimate moneylenders Neither the licensing and supervision of the state banking department nor the loan rate the amount and conditions of the bond to the state nor other principal provisions should be altered All other sections and subsections of the draft of the act is essential to round out and complete the bill so as to insure protection of the public and establishment of legitimate competition between moneylenders thereby lowering the rate which borrowers are required to pay for small loan accommodations If further instructions or special information is desired by any interested in antiloan shark legislation with a view to legalizing standardizing dignifying and regulating the business under laws fair both to borrowers and lenders they are requested to communicate with the undersigned bureau It is especially devoted to reform antiloan shark legislation Correspondence is invited The Ideal AntiLoan Shark

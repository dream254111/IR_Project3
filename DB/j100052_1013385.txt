J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1013385,THE REDUCTION OF ABSENCES AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY,I242658,THE REDUCTION OF ABSENCES AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY BY JOHN S KEIR INSTRUCTOR IN INDURTRY WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE AND COMMERCE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA IT IS PERHAPS HERESY TO QUARREL WITH AN OLD ADAGE IN LINE HOWEVER WITH A CURRENT BIT OF PHILOSOPHY THAT IT IS AS EXPEDIENT TO BE HANGED FOR A SHEEP AS FOR A LAMB THIS PAPER WILL TAKE ISSUE NOT WITH ONE OLD ADAGE BUT WITH TWO THERE IS A PROVERB THAT TO BE ABSENT MAKES ONE CONSPICUOUS ANOTHER HOLDS THAT THE ABSENT ARE ALWAYS GUILTY WE WISH TO TAKE THE GROUND THAT NEITHER OF THESE IS OF NECESSITY TRUE AS IT IS AN ECONOMIC AXIOM THAT NO PROGRESS CAN BE MADE UNTIL THERE IS A DEFINITION OF TERMS IT IS NECESSARY BEFORE GOING FURTHER TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ABSENT UNDER DISCUSSION ARE THE INDUSTRIAL ABSENT AND BY THE INDUSTRIAL ABSENT ARE MEANTJONES THE MACHINIST WHO DOES NOT COME TO WORK ON MONDAY MORNING AND SMITH WHO LOSES HALF A DAY ON WEDNESDAY BY ABSENCE WE DO NOT MEAN LABOR TURNOVER OR UNEMPLOYMENT ABSENCE IS UNQUESTIONABLY A FACTOR IN LABOR TURNOVER BUT FOR OUR PURPOSE THE TERMS ARE BY NO MEANS SYNONYMS TURNOVER IS THE BROADER TERM IT IS SAID THAT A MANS OR FIRMS POCKETBOOK IS A VITAL ORGAN IT WOULD SEEM THEN THAT ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH THE APPORTION MENT OR OUTLAY OF THE PURSES CONTENTS WOULD BE KNOWN TO ITS OWNER BUT THERE ARE PRACTICALLY NO FIGURES OBTAINABLE ON THE EXACT COST OF INDUSTRIAL ABSENCES MOREOVER AS ONE FIRM ADMITS MOST ESTIMATES IN THIS CONNECTION ARE NOT ESTIMATES AT ALL THEY ARE SIMPLY WILD GUES SES CLOSER ESTIMATES HOWEVER MAY BE MADE IN AN INDIRECT WAY FOR INSTANCE THE L BAMBERGER COMPANY OF NEWARK ESTIMATES THAT THEY HAVE TO EMPLOY 5 PER CENT MORE PEOPLE THAN IS ABSOLUTELY NECES SARY BECAUSE OF THE FACTOR OF ABSENCE THE DENNISON MANUFACTURING COMPANY FIGURES THE AVERAGE WAGE LOSS TO BE FORTYTWO CENTS A WEEK TO EACH FEMALE FACTORY WORKER AND FORTYNINE CENTS A WEEK TO EACH MALE FACTORY WORKER THESE FIGURES BASED ON THE AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE BEING PAID AT THE TIME THE STUDY WAS MADE THE TOTAL WAGE LOSS IS 50000 A YEAR A CONCERN IN DETROIT IS SPENDING 50000 A MONTH 140ABSENCE AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY TO PREVENT ABSENCES AND THE FIRM CONSIDERS THE MONEY IS WELL SPENT AT ONE TIME THE BEACON FALLS RUBBER SHOE COMPANY FOUND THAT THEY COULD RELY ON ONLY 60 PER CENT OF THEIR WORKERS SHOWING UP FOR ANY ONE SHIFT THE CURTIS PUBLISHING COMPANY REPORTS AN AVERAGE OF FORTYTWO CASES OF ABSENCE IN EVERY 1000 EMPLOYE SESSION DURING THE MONTH OF JANUARY 1917 THE CROMPTONKNOWLES LOOM WORKS FINDS AN AVERAGE ABSENTEEISM AMOUNTING TO 8 PER CENT IF THESE FIGURES BE MULTIPLIED BY THE 270000 INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES THE COST AND THE AMOUNT OF ABSENCE LOOMS TREMENDOUS THAT THIS AMOUNT OF INDUSTRIAL ABSENCE IS NOT CONSPICUOUS AND IS NOT PARTICULARLY UNDER THE SUSPICIOUS EYE OF THE PURSE HOLDER IS A CURIOUS FACT ONLY ABOUT ONE OUT OF TWELVE CONCERNS MAKES ANY EFFORT TO CHECK UP OR REMEDY THIS CONDITION IN DISCUSSING THE SECOND HERESY NAMELY THAT THE ABSENT ARE NOT OF NECESSITY GUILTY IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT INVESTIGATION SHALL GO INTO CONSIDERABLY GREATER DETAIL THAN WAS THE CASE WITH THE FIRST IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT CAUSES LIE BACK OF ABSENCES IN THE SECOND PLACE WHAT VARIOUS METHODS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO OVERCOME OR COMBAT ABSENCES IN TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE REASONS BACK OF ABSENCES IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THOSE MENTIONED IN NO WAY CONSTITUTE THE COMPLETE LIST IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT A COMPLETE LIST COULD BE OB TAINED NO MATTER HOW EXHAUSTIVE AN INVESTIGATION MIGHT BE MADE ONLY THOSE CAUSES MOST EVIDENT AND GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WILL BE DISCUSSED A PROLIFIC SOURCE OF ABSENCE IS LATENESSES THIS MAY SEEM A PARADOX YET THE CONNECTION IS A FAIRLY OBVIOUS ONE HERE AGAIN EXACT FIGURES CANNOT BE QUOTED BUT A FEW GENERAL EXAMPLES WILL SUFFICE TO BRING OUT THE POINT A GREAT NUMBER OF MANUFACTURING PLANTS ADOPT A POLICY OF LOCKING THEIR GATES AT A CERTAIN TIME IN THE MORNING OR AFTERNOON AND KEEPING THEM LOCKED UNTIL THAT PARTICULAR WORKPERIOD IS OVER THE CLEVELAND METAL PRODUCTS COMPANY FOR INSTANCE AFTER 715 IN THE MORNING IS CLOSED TO THE EMPLOYE UN TIL NOON THE FORE RIVER SHIP BUILDING COMPANY CLOSES ITS PLANT TO THE STRAGGLER AFTER 745 AM AND 1245 PM THE GENERAL ELEC TRIC COMPANY AT LYNN FOLLOWS THIS SAME IDEA AS DO MANY OF THE LARGE TEXTILE MILLS AT LOWELL THE FIRST CAUSE OF LATENESS IS POOR TRANSPORTATION THIS IS 141THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE OUTSIDE THE CITY AND COME IN FOR THEIR WORK FOR EXAMPLE ONE EMPLOYE OF THE LANSTON MON OTYPE COMPANY IN PHILADELPHIA OWNS A FARM IN NEW JERSEY THE TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES ARE SUCH THAT HE HAS TO GET TO THE FACTORY EITHER A WHOLE HOUR BEFORE THE PLANT IS SCHEDULED TO START OR COME IN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES AFTER IT HAS STARTED HE GENERALLY CHOOSES THE LATTER THE FOREMAN OR EXECUTIVE OF COURSE HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL HIM HE MUST GET THERE ON TIME OR NOT COME AT ALL AND TO DO IT WITHOUT LOOKING UP THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS AND ATTEMPTING SOME ADJUSTMENT FAIR TO BOTH THE MAN AND THE FIRM THIS PARTICULAR MAN HAS BEEN WITH THE COMPANY FIFTEEN YEARS AND TO GIVE UP HIS FARM IN NEW JERSEY WOULD BE A SEVERE FINANCIAL BLOW TO HIM SUCH PROBLEMS ARE VERY FREQUENT UNDER THE PRESENT HAPHAZARD SYSTEM THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE PERSON IN QUESTION TOO OFTEN IS THE DECID ING FACTOR IN MEETING ISSUES OF THIS SORT TRANSPORTATION TIEUPS WITHIN THE CITY OR TOWN ARE TOO COMMON TO NEED ANY FURTHER DISCUS SION ANOTHER OBVIOUS FACTOR IS THE WEATHER ANY SCHOOL TEACHER IS FAMILIAR WITH THE INCREASED TARDINESS ON DARK WINTER MORNINGS IN A CLASS OF SOPHOMORES AT ONE OF OUR LARGE UNIVERSITIES ON A DARK MORNING IN FEBRUARY ELEVEN OUT OF THIRTY WERE FIVE MINUTES LATE THE CURTIS PUBLISHING COMPANY FINDS THE SAME IS TRUE OF ITS WORKING FORCE THE HABIT OF LATENESS IS ANOTHER BIG FACTOR IN OUR CHILDHOOD DAYS WE ALL PROBABLY HEARD OF THE TEN OCLOCK SCHOLAR AND WE FIND HIM IN BUSINESS AS WELL AS IN SCHOOL ONE EXECUTIVE HAS SAID THAT NEARLY 90 PER CENT OF ALL LATENESS IS SIMPLY HABIT POSSIBLY THAT FIGURE IS EXAGGERATED BUT THE HABIT IS ALL TOO PREVALENT AT BEST THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF THE TIME CLOCK SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ITS RELATION TO LATENESS WHEN IS AN EMPLOYE LATE MUST HE BE AT HIS POST OR SIMPLY IN THE FACTORY IS A QUESTION WHICH AN EMPLOYER SHOULD HAVE IN MIND BEFORE HE LOCATES HIS TIME CLOCK SOMETIMES THE CLOCK IS PLACED IN THE DEPARTMENT SOMETIMES AT THE MAIN EN TRANCE FOR EXAMPLE AT JOHN WANAMAKERS PHILADELPHIA STORE A GIRL RINGS UP AT THE TIME CLOCK WHICH IS NEAREST TO HER DEPARTMENT BUT SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AT HER PLACE WHEN THE STORE OPENS A GREAT MANY OF THE CAUSES OF LATENESS ARE IDENTICAL WITH THE CAUSES OF ABSENCE AND MAY BE CONSIDERED UNDER THAT HEADING A MOST IMPORTANT EXCUSE FOR ABSENCE IS SICKNESS THUS THE L BAM 142ABSENCE AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY BERGER COMPANY FIND THAT OUT OF A TOTAL DAILY ABSENCE OF 052 PER CENT 033 PER CENT IS DUE TO SICKNESS THE EDISON ELECTRICAL COM PANY OF BOSTON PLACES IT AT 25 PER CENT OF ALL THEIR ABSENCES WHILE THE HOOD RUBBER COMPANY PLACES IT AS HIGH AS 60 PER CENT OF COURSE SICKNESS IS A TERM WHICH COVERS A MULTITUDE OF SINS SOME OF IT IS NOT VERY SERIOUS AND SOME OF IT IS ENTIRELY ASSUMED ONE FIRM HAS CALLED IT A LACK OF GAMENESS A GIVING IN TO THE SLIGHTEST INDISPOSITIONS IT FORMS THE HANDIEST EXCUSE IF AN EXCUSE IS NEEDED OF ACTUAL HANDICAPPING SICKNESS HOWEVER THERE IS ENOUGH TO WARRANT CONSIDERATION THE TWO MOST PREVALENT DISEASES ARE ALCOHOLISM AND STOMACH TROUBLE IN ALCOHOLISM THE LOCATION OF THE SALOON HAS A DIRECT BEARING ON THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM THERE IS A TOWN IN SOUTHERN CONNECTICUT WHICH HAS FOURTEEN SALOONS WITHIN THREE BLOCKS OF ITS BUSIEST MANUFACTURING PLANTS AND WITHIN EASY REACH OF A GREAT MANY HOMES OF THE MEN WHO WORK IN THE PLANTS A MINING TOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA HAS SALOONS AS NEAR THE SHAFTS OF THE MINE AS THE COMPANY WILL PERMIT STOMACH TROUBLE COVERS A MULTITUDE OF ILLS ACHES AND PAINS WITH SICKNESS IS THE WHOLE GAMUT OF INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS THESE TOO FORM A COMMON CAUSE OF ABSENCE THE UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION FOUND THAT OVER A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS WITH THREE HUNDRED DAYS COUNTED TO THE AVERAGE YEAR AND IN A PLANT EMPLOY ING 6600 MEN THE AMOUNT OF DAYS LOST PER WORKER WAS 62 PER CENT IN THE STEEL WORKS WHERE THE ACCIDENT RATE IS HIGH AND 24 PER CENT PER MAN IN THE YARDS WHERE THE ACCIDENT RATE IS RELATIVELY LOW THE TIME OF YEAR AFFECTS ABSENCES IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT SCHOOL ATTENDANCE IS BEST DURING AUTUMN AND SPRING THAT IN THE NEW YORK SCHOOLS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ABSENCES OCCUR IN JANUARY AND THE NEXT LARGEST NUMBER OCCUR IN JUNE UNFORTUNATELY NO FIGURES HAVE BEEN COLLECTED TO SHOW THE RESULTS OF THIS INFLUENCE ON INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS THE DAY OF THE WEEK UNQUESTIONABLY HAS A PLACE BLUE MONDAY HAS A VERY REAL RING FROM THE MANUFACTURERS VIEWPOINT THE DENNISON MANUFACTURING COMPANY FINDS ITS LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF ABSENCES ON MONDAY THE FORE RIVER SHIP BUILDING COMPANY OVER A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS FINDS A CONSISTENT AVRIAGE OF 10 PER CENT OF ABSENTEEISM ON THIS DAY WITH ODDLY ENOUGH THURSDAY MORNING AS A CLOSE SECOND WITH 7 PER CENT THE CLEVELAND METAL PRODUCTS COMPANY HAS EPITOMIZED ITS SITUATION AS THE MONDAY 143THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY HABIT THE CAUSES OF MONDAYS PROMINENCE ARE LEGION A GREAT MAJORITY OF EXECUTIVES SEEM TO FEEL THAT MUCH OF THE MONDAY AB SENCE IS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY AND COULD BE AVOIDED THE COMMON PRACTICE OF PAYING ON SATURDAY MIGHT BE A FACTOR IN THIS QUESTION FOR WITH HIS PAY IN HIS POCKET AND A DAY AND A HALF OFF THERE IS NOTHING TO KEEP JACK A DULL BOYUNTIL MONDAY MORNING ALMOST ANY PAYDAY WILL BREED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ABSENCE SOME FIRMS HAVE DISCONTINUED THE SATURDAY PAYDAY THE TIME OF DAY ALSO ENTERS IN THE HOOD RUBBER COMPANY REPORTS A 10 PER CENT ABSENTEEISM FROM THE NIGHT SHIFT AS AGAINST 8 PER CENT FROM THE DAY SHIFTS THE DAYS AFTER HOLIDAYS COME IN FOR THEIR QUOTA OF BLAME THE FORE RIVER SHIP BUILDING COMPANY QUOTES AN INCREASE OF 3 PER CENT AFTER A HOLIDAY IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY OUT OF A CLASS OF THIRTYEIGHT ONLY SEVEN REPORTED AT THE FIRST MEETING OF THE CLASS ON THE DAY COLLEGE REOPENED DR ELLSWORTH HUNTINGTON IN A STUDY OF A CUBAN CIGAR FACTORY SAYS THAT THE CUBANS HAVE A GREAT AVERSION TO WORKING ON MONDAY THE DAY AFTER THEIR VERY REAL AND STRENUOUS SUNDAY HOLIDAY ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THE FORCE APPEARS THOSE THAT DO COME ARRIVE LATE AND GET ONLY 80 PER CENT AS MUCH DONE AS ON OTHER DAYS LET US CONSIDER NEXT SOME OF THOSE THINGS WHICH HAVE MORE TO DO WITH THE WORKERS PERSONALLY THE SEX OF THE WORKER MAKES A DIFFERENCE NEARLY EVERY CONCERN WHICH EMPLOYS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE THE ESTERBROOK PEN COMPANY AND THE CAMPBELL SOUP COMPANY FINDS THAT NOT ONLY IS THERE A HIGHER TURNOVER AMONG THE WOMEN THAN AMONG THE MEN BUT ALSO THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF ABSENCE IS GREATER IN THE CASE OF THE WOMEN THE A M COLLINS MANUFACTURING COMPANY CARRIES OUT A PREMIUM SCHEME ONLY IN THE CASE OF ITS WOMEN EMPLOYES BECAUSE IT WAS AMONG THEM THAT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF LATENESS AND ABSENCE EXISTED THE DENNISON MANUFACTURING COMPANY HAS BEEN THE BEST SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON THIS POINT THEY HAVE FOUND IN THE FACTORY DEPARTMENTS AN ABSENTEE RECORD OF 52 PER CENT AMONG THE WOMEN 35 PER CENT AMONG THE MEN IN THE FACTORY CLERICAL DEPART MENTS THE PERCENTAGES WERE JUST ALIKE BUT IN THE CLERICAL SALES DIVISION AGAIN THE WOMEN SHOWED 26 PER CENT AS OPPOSED TO 11 PER CENT FOR THE MEN IN THE OFFICE FORCE THERE WAS THUS NO DIFFERENCE WHILE IN THE FACTORY DEPARTMENT THE DIFFERENCE WAS STRIKING IN T44ABSENCE AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY GENERAL TARDINESS AMONG WOMEN EMPLOYES PROBABLY RESTS UPON TWO MAIN ELEMENTS PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS AND HOME RESPONSIBILITIES MANY GIRLS TRY TO CARRY ON A HOME JOB AND A SHOP JOB AT THE SAME TIME AND IT IS PERHAPS A SAFE ASSUMPTION THAT BOTH JOBS SUFFER THE TYPE OF WAGE PAYMENT IS ANOTHER FACTOR DOES THE PIECE WORKER BECAUSE HE CAN HURRY AND MAKE UP LOST TIME AND BECAUSE HIS TIME IS IN A SENSE HIS OWN TAKE A DAY OFF WITH AN EASIER CONSCIENCE AND UNDER LESS PROVOCATION THAN THE DAY WORKER CERTAINLY IT IS OPEN TO ARGUMENT TOGETHER WITH THIS QUESTION OF WAGES WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER RAISES IN SALARY SOME MEN HAVE SAID INCREASING PAY MEANS DE CREASING ATTENDANCE AND OTHERS HAVE TAKEN THE OPPOSITE VIEW THE FISK RUBBER COMPANY SAYS THAT SOME OF ITS MEN WHO MAKE EIGHT DOLLARS A DAY ARGUE THAT THEY CAN MAKE ENOUGH IN FIVE DAYS THE CLEVELAND METAL PRODUCTS COMPANY ASSUMES THAT PRESENT HIGH WAGES LEAD TO A GREATER USE OF INTOXICANTS AND CONSEQUENTLY TO MORE FREQUENT LAYOFFS ON THE OTHER HAND THESE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE WITNESSED ALL KINDS OF BONUS SYSTEMS PROFITSHARING SCHEMES AND BLANKET RAISERS IT IS BY FAR TOO BIG A PROBLEM TO WARRANT ANY POSITIVE STATEMENTS A RATHER NEBULOUS FACTOR IN ABSENCE IS AN INDEFINITE THING WHICH WE MIGHT LABEL AS THE DISCONTENT OF THE WORKER THIS DISCONTENT MAY ARISE FROM CONDITIONS OUTSIDE THE FACTORY SUCH AS LACK OF RECREATION IN THE LOCALITY OR FROM CONDITIONS WITHIN THE FACTORY SUCH AS DISLIKE OF HIS PARTICULAR JOB OR FRICTION WITH HIS FOREMAN OR WITH THE MEN OF HIS SHIFT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MEASURE OR TO TRACE THE DEFINITE INFLUENCE OF AN ELEMENT OF DISCONTENT BUT IT MUST BE MENTIONED IN PASSING FOR IT UNQUESTIONABLY HAS A DEFINITE EFFECT THE INDUSTRIAL SITUATION AND THE CONDITION OF THE LABOR MARKET PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT R6LE IN LATENESSES AND ABSENCES THE CROMP TONKNOWLES COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY ALL ITS ABSENCES ON THE GROUND OF ABUNDANT WORK IN ADDITION TO THE EASE OF OBTAINING A NEW JOB THE PRESENT HIGH WAGES MAKE THE FINANCIAL LOSS OF AN IDLE DAY OR TWO A MATTER OF NO ACCOUNT THE CLEVELAND METAL PRODUCTS COMPANY FINDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A DECIDED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ABSENCES DURING THE PAST YEAR AND THEY ATTRIBUTE THEM TO THIS CAUSE TARDINESS HAS ALSO INCREASED IN THIS FIRM RUNNING A LITTLE LESS THAN 1 PER CENT OF THEIR ENTIRE FORCE THE JOSEPH AND FEISS COM PANY SHOW AN INCREASE IN ABSENCE OF 25 PER CENT PER DAY IN 1916 145THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AGAINST 15 PER CENT PER DAY IN 1915 A CHANGE WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTE TO THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE LABOR MARKET IN A LARGE SHOE COMPANY IN PHILADELPHIA CONSPICUOUS SIGNS ARE POSTED CALLING AT TENTION TO THE RULES REGARDING ABSENCES AND LATENESS BUT ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES ADMITS THAT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THEY HAVE MADE NO EFFORT TO ENFORCE THEM AS A LAST CAUSE FOR ABSENCE WE PLACE THE WEATHER IT IS PER HAPS BECAUSE THIS REASON IS SO OBVIOUS THAT NO ONE HAS EVER TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO ANALYZE IT CAREFULLY PROBABLY THE BEST WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS CONNECTION IS A STUDY OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IN NEW YORK CITY AND IN DENVER COLORADO MADE BY E J DEXTER THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TENYEAR OLD SCHOOL BOY AND THE THIRTYYEAR OLD MACHINIST AND YET THESE RESULTS MIGHT HAVE SOME COMPARATIVE VALUE IT WAS FOUND THAT ON CLOUDY DAYS ATTEND ANCE WAS NOT SO GOOD AS ON BRIGHT DAYS FIFTEEN PER CENT OF ALL ABSENCES OCCURRED AT A TIME WHEN THE TEMPERATURE WAS LOWEST AND THE NEXT LARGEST GROUP OCCURRED WHEN THE THERMOMETER REGISTERED ABOVE NINETY DEGREES THE NUMBER OF ABSENCES INCREASED WHEN THE HUMIDITY WAS HIGH A THING NOT SO HARD TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGH HUMIDITY ALMOST INVARIABLY CAUSING RAIN ODDLY ENOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF THE BOYS SEEMED TO BE MORE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE WEATHER THAN THAT OF THE GIRLS THERE ARE OTHER CAUSES OF ABSENCE FOR WHICH FIRMS ARE THEMSELVES DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE SUCH THINGS AS A FLUCTUATING WORK SCHEDULE AND SHUTTING DOWN FOR INVENTORY QUITE NATURALLY MAKE FOR AN IN CREASED ABSENTEE RECORD THE WORKMAN PAYS FOR THIS IN TIME LOST BUT ABSENCES OF THIS NATURE BREED LABOR TURNOVER AND FOR LABOR TURNOVER THE COMPANIES PAY POSSIBLY THE ACCOUNTS BALANCE SO FAR WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH CAUSES REMEDIES MUST FOLLOW AND OF THESE THERE ARE TWO KINDS ALLEVIATION AND PREVEN TION EITHER OR BOTH MUST BE SOUGHT AND TESTED TO FIT INDIVIDUAL AND LOCALIZED NEEDS WE HAVE SAID THAT ONE OF THE CAUSES OF ABSENCE IS LATENESS IF THEREFORE WE DO AWAY WITH LATENESS IPSO FACTO WE MAY CUT DOWN ABSENCE THE HABIT OF LATENESS IS DIFFERENT A STUDENT IN A LARGE LECTURE COURSE IN ONE OF OUR UNIVERSITIES CAME TO CLASS FIVE MINUTES LATE ELEVEN TIMES IN SUCCESSION NEARLY ALL LATENESSES OCCUR WITHIN THE FIRST HALF HOUR 95 PER CENT IS THE ESTIMATE OF THE MIDVALE STEEL COMPANY AND THE BULK OF THIS 95 PER CENT IS WITHIN THE FIRST TEN 146ABSENCE AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY MINUTES TO COMBAT THIS CONDITION THIS COMPANY LEVIES A SMALL FINE ON LATENESSES THAT OCCUR WITHIN THE OPENING HALF HOUR THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT MAY BE GIVEN HALF CUTS FOR AN OFFICE FORCE IT IS SAID THAT A TIME CLOCK IS A GREAT INCENTIVE TO DEVELOP THE HABIT OF BEING ON TIMEALTHOUGH A TIME CLOCK IS IRRITATING TO NEARLY ALL OFFICE MEN OFTEN A TIMELY WARNING WILL SERVE TO CHECK THE HABIT AN EXECUTIVE OF A SCIENTIFICALLY MANAGED CONCERN FOUND THAT ONE OF HIS STENOGRAPHERS HAD THE HABIT OF BEING A LITTLE LATE ONE DAY SHE FAILED TO APPEAR AT ALL AND HE ADVERTISED FOR ANOTHER STENOGRAPHER IT SO HAPPENED THAT SHE HAD A LEGITIMATE EXCUSE FOR THIS PARTICULAR ABSENCE BUT WHEN HER LATENESS RECORD WAS SHOWN HER SHE HAD NO EXCUSE TO OFFER SHE ASKED HOWEVER FOR ANOTHER CHANCE AND DUR ING A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS SINCE THAT TIME SHE HAS NOT BEEN LATE ONCE THE HABIT HOWEVER IS NOT ALWAYS SO READILY AND WILLINGLY BROKEN THE QUESTION OF DOCKING FOR LATENESS IS MUCH THE SAME AS THE QUESTION OF GENERAL DOCKING FOR ABSENCE THERE ARE HOWEVER ONE OR TWO SYSTEMS WHICH APPLY MORE PARTICULARLY TO LATENESS ALONE THUS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CLEVELAND METAL PRODUCTS COMPANY FOR ANY FRACTION OF TIME UNDER FIFTEEN MINUTES A MAN IS RECORDED AS AND DOCKED FOR THE FULL FIFTEEN MINUTES THE LEEDS AND NORTHROP COMPANY HAVE A FIVE AND TEN MINUTE PLAN IF A MAN IS LATE FIVE MINUTES HE IS DOCKED HALF AN HOUR TEN MINUTES A FULL HOUR ETC SCHEMES OF THIS SORT MEET WITH VARYING SUCCESS A DEVICE WHICH BRINGS VERY REAL RESULTS IS ONE WHICH MAKES LATENESS DIFFICULT IF A MAN ARRIVES LATE AT THE GATE OF THE FORE RIVER SHIP BUILDING COM PANY AND FEELS THAT HE HAS AN EXCUSE HIS CASE HAS FIRST TO BE REFERRED TO THE CHIEF TIME KEEPER WHO IN TURN REFERS IT TO THE FOREMAN IF THE FOREMAN IS WILLING THE MAN IS ADMITTED IT IS FOUND THAT THE MA JORITY OF MEN WILL MAKE A SPECIAL EFFORT TO BE ON TIME RATHER THAN HAVE TO GO THROUGH SUCH A PROCESS AT STRAWBRIDGE AND CLOTHIERS STORE IN PHILADELPHIA THOSE WHO ARE LATE MUST GO TO A CENTRAL DESK AND SIGN A SLIP WITH THE RESULT THAT LATENESSES ARE ONLY ABOUT 25 PER CENT AS AGAINST A FORMER RECORD OF FROM 5 TO 10 PER CENT THE J B STETSON COMPANY REQUIRES A PASS TO BE OBTAINED BEFORE THE TARDY OPERATIVE IS ALLOWED TO ENTER HIS DEPARTMENT THESE PASSES ARE THEN FILED AND KEPT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE AT THE PLANT OF THE PLIMPTON PRESS THE LATES REPORT TO THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT THEN THEY FILL OUT A LATE TICKET GIVING THE OPERATIVES NAME HIS 147THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY NUMBER AND THE REASON FOR HIS TARDINESS COMBINED WITH THIS IS A SORT OF DOCKING SYSTEM ALSO IF THE EMPLOYE IS EXCUSED HE IS PAID FROM THE TIME HE REPORTS TO HIS WORK PLACE IF HE IS UNEXCUSED FOR ANY TIME BEFORE 830 HE IS GIVEN AN 830 TICKET AND LOSES ALL TIME PREVIOUS TO THAT HOUR THE AVERAGE PER CENT OF LATENESS PER WORK ING DAY IN THIS PLANT IS NOW ONLY 247 PER CENT A VARIETY OF OTHER DEVICES OF A SIMILAR NATURE ARE EMPLOYED ALL WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW NAMELY TO PUT A PREMIUM ON COMING IN ON TIME BY MAKING IT FINANCIALLY OR CONSPICUOUSLY TROUBLESOME TO COME IN LATE DOCKING IS A DEVICE WITH WHICH WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR TO THE PIECE WORKER DOCKING IS PERHAPS NOT SERIOUS FOR IT IS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE UP THE MONEY LOSS BY EXTRA EFFORT THE DAY WORKER DOES NOT HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY THE MIDVALE STEEL COMPANY HAS A VERY DEFINITE SYSTEM OF FINES FOR ALL SORTS OF MINOR OFFENCES AT THE CURTIS PUBLISHING COMPANYS PLANT ANY UNEXCUSED LATENESS IS FINED AT THE RATE OF TIME AND HALF TIME SALARY RATE THE GERMAN AMERICAN BUTTON COMPANY LEVIES A SMALL FINE FOR LATENESS THE PROCEEDS FROM WHICH ARE PLACED IN AN EMPLOYES TRUST FUND FOR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF GENERAL EMPLOYES ACTIVITIES THERE SEEMS TO BE A GROWING FEELING AGAINST FINING SYSTEMS ANY SUCH SYSTEM BECOMES DANGEROUS UNLESS THE EMPLOYES KNOW WHERE THE MONEY FROM SUCH FINES GOES MOREOVER A FINING SYSTEM IS NOT USUALLY ADEQUATE FOR MANY EMPLOYES WILL PAY THE FINE FEELING THAT IN SO DOING ALL RESPONSIBILITY ON THEIR PART CEASES THE CAREFUL RECORDS OF LATENESS AND ABSENCE WHICH ARE KEPT IN ANY UPTODATE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT SERVE AS AN INDIRECT FINING SYSTEM SINCE A MANS RECORD IS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHETHER HE SHALL RECEIVE A RAISE FOR WHICH HE HAS APPLIED THUS IN COMBATING LATENESS AND ABSENCE THE A M COLLINS MANUFACTURING COMPANY FEELS IT IS FUNDAMENTAL THAT THE EMPLOYES SHALL REALIZE THAT THOSE IN CHARGE KNOW HOW OFTEN THEY ARE LATE AND HOW OFTEN THEY STAY OUT ALL DAY TO THIS END THE FIRM PREPARED A CARD WHICH SHOWS THE TOTAL POSSIBLE NUMBER OF HOURS FOR ANY ONE PERSON TO WORK MAKING ALLOW ANCE FOR HOLIDAYS SHUTDOWNS AND THINGS OF A SIMILAR NATURE THE EMPLOYES RECORD IS KEPT ON THIS CARD AND IT SHOWS AT A GLANCE THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ACTUAL HOURS WHICH HE HAS WORKED AND THOSE WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE WORKED THESE CARDS ARE KEPT WITH OTHER IN 148ABSENCE AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY FORMATION AND OFTEN FORM THE BASIS FOR SALARY RAISES OR FOR PROMOTION OR SUPPLY THE GROUNDS ON WHICH EITHER MAY BE REFUSED IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT ONE OF THE MAIN WEAKNESSES OF OUR MUNIC IPAL GOVERNMENTS IS THAT NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE CENTERING RESPON SIBILITY FOR CIVIL EVILS TENDS TO REMOVE THOSE EVILS THIS IS PERHAPS TRUE LIKEWISE OF INDUSTRY IN GENERAL AND OF OUR PROBLEM IN PARTICULAR THE ONE EXCEPTION TO THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE WHERE THE RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN CENTERED ON THE FOREMAN ALONE THAT IS NOT AN ALTOGETHER FAIR STATEMENT EITHER FOR THE PROBLEM OF ABSENCES IS ONLY ONE OF THE MANY THAT A FOREMAN HAS TO SOLVE WE HAVE SEEN HOW KEEPING REC ORDS IS ONE WAY OF CENTERING RESPONSIBILITY AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A CONCENTRATION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR LATENESS AND ABSENCE IN THIS CONNECTION THE CROMPTONKNOWLES COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CON TINUED PRESSURE FROM HIGH AUTHORITY IS THE BEST WAY OF KEEPING AB SENCES DOWN TO A MINIMUM THE ABSENCES ARE REVIEWED BY THE GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT AND BY THE WORKS SUPERINTENDENT WHO IN TURN TAKE THEM UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOREMAN IN THIS WAY THE NUMBER OF ABSENTEES HAS BEEN REDUCED 30 PER CENT WITHIN THE LAST SIX MONTHS THE DENNISON MANUFACTURING COMPANY ON THE OTHER HAND HAS GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF CONCENTRATING THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE FOREMAN ALONE ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT METHODS IS THE POSTING OF COMPARATIVE BULLETINS THE CROMPTONKNOWLES COM PANY COMPILES A MONTHLY REPORT OF ITS ABSENTEES AND IT IS THE DESIRE OF THE FOREMEN TO MAKE A GOOD REPORT THAT STIMULATES THEM TO GIVE THIS PROBLEM ITS DUE ATTENTION IN 1913 THE CURTIS PUBLISHING COMPANY BEGAN POSTING BULLE TINS SHOWING LATENESSES BY DIVISION AND THE STANDING OF EACH DIVI SION IN REFERENCE TO THE OTHERS JUST RECENTLY ABSENCES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THIS BULLETIN FROM 1913 TO 1915 LATENESSES WERE CUT DOWN FROM THIRTEEN PER ONE THOUSAND TO NINE BORROWING THIS IDEA OF STIMULATING RIVALRY BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS STRAWBRIDGE AND CLOTHIER WORKED OUT A SIMILAR SCHEME AT FIRST THE BULLETINS WERE NOT ISSUED BUT WERE SIMPLY SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT HEADS AND THIS SYSTEM ALONE CUT LATENESSES IN HALF THE LANSTON MONOTYPE COM PANY ALSO POSTS A COMPARATIVE BULLETIN WITH THE RESULT THAT THEIR ABSENCE RECORD WHILE NEVER VERY HIGH NOW RUNS LESS THAN 2 PER CENT IN THE BRIDGEPORT PLANT OF THE INTERNATIONAL SILVER COMPANY RIVALRY IS STIMULATED AMONG THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS BY POSTING THE RECORD OF THEIR SERVICE REWARD BY DEPARTMENTS WITHIN EACH DE 149THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PARTMENT ITSELF A BULLETIN IS POSTED SHOWING THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE EARNING SERVICE REWARDS IN THAT DEPARTMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT WHICH MAKES THE BEST RECORD IN A GIVEN WEEK A BANNER IS AWARDED THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BROUGHT RESULTS THE MAN WHO LOSES HIS SERVICE REWARD IS LAUGHED AT BY HIS COMRADES AND CONTINUED ABSENTEEISM THREATENS HIS POPULARITY THE SUCCESS OF ANY SUCH PLAN WILL DEPEND VERY LARGELY ON THE WAY THE BANNER IS PRESENTED THIS CENTERING OF RESPONSIBILITY HAS SO FAR BEEN VERY LARGELY IN THE DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ITS OPERATION STRAWBRIDGE AND CLOTHIER ADOPTED A PLAN OF POSTING THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO WERE LATE MORE THAN TWICE IN THE SAME WEEK WITH THE RESULT THAT THE RATIO WAS STILL FURTHER CUT THE DENNISON MANUFACTURING COMPANY SENT OUT A SERIES OF ABSENCE SLIPS TO EACH DEPARTMENT ON THESE SLIPS ARE ENTERED ALL ABSENCES WHETHER EXCUSED OR UNEXCUSED THE SLIPS ARE SO ARRANGED THAT NO BROKEN TIME CAN APPEAR ON AN EMPLOYES CLOCK CARD WITHOUT AN ABSENCE SLIP EXPLAINING THIS LOSS THE OBJECT WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL LOST TIME WAS REPORTED WITH THIS RECORD TABULATED EACH MONTH INDIVIDUAL CASES ARE TAKEN UP WITH THE EM PLOYMENT DEPARTMENT IF A LOSS IS DUE TO AN OPERATIVES HOME DUTIES SHE IS ASKED TO CORRECT IT OR ELSE TO GIVE UP HER POSITION THIS CEN TERING OF RESPONSIBILITY BY THE POSTING OF BULLETINS IS AN INTERESTING COMMENTARY ON THE POWER OF PUBLICITY THUS FAR THERE HAS BEEN NO QUARREL WITH THE ADAGE THAT THE AB SENT ARE ALWAYS GUILTY IN A SENSE THIS IS CORRECT FOR ALL THESE SYS TEMS ARE BASED ON THE PHILOSOPHY THAT THE ABSENT ARE GUILTYGUILTY IN THE SENSE THAT ABSENCE IS AN INDIVIDUAL MATTER OVER WHICH A CON CERN HAS NO CONTROL HEREIN LIES THE POINT OF DIFFERENCE FOR THERE IS A CONTROL THAT CAN BE AND SHOULD BE EXERCISED BY THE EMPLOYER AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS SAID TO BE WORTH A POUND OF CURE WE HAVE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING THE POUND OF CURE THE OUNCE OF PRE VENTION IS RATHER A NEW DEPARTURE ONE OF THE FIRST PLANS WHICH HAS BEEN PUT INTO PRACTICE HAS BEEN THE REWARDING OF PUNCTUALITY AND REGULARITY BY MEANS OF BONUSES THESE MAY TAKE SEVERAL FORMS SOME ARE PURELY CASH SOME ARE CASH PLUS THE ADDED INCENTIVE OF A VACATION SOME ARE SIMPLY TOKENS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER THE BEACON FALLS RUBBER SHOE COMPANY IN ORDER TO INDUCE THEIR FORCE TO BE PUNCTUAL AND STEADY ADOPTED THE SCHEME OF PAYING A DOLLAR A WEEK BONUS TO ANY EMPLOYE WHO TURNED IN A PERFECT TICKET 150ABSENCE AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY FOR A WEEK THIS HAD THE RESULT OF REDUCING THEIR ABSENTEE RECORD BY NEARLY THIRTY PER CENT THE DETROIT STEEL CASTING COMPANY GIVES A BONUS OF TWENTYFIVE CENTS FOR EACH WORKING DAY DURING THE PAY ROLL PERIOD THUS IF AN EMPLOYE WORKS A THIRTEENDAY PERIOD HE RECEIVES A TOTAL BONUS OF 325 THIS SYSTEM HAS ONLY BEEN IN USE SINCE JULY 1916 AND HAS NOT HAD TIME TO PROVE ITSELF THE COMPANY FEELS THAT IT HAS DONE MUCH TO KEEP THE MEN STEADILY AT THEIR JOBS AT THE BRIDGEPORT PLANT OF THE INTERNATIONAL SILVER COMPANY THEY HAVE INSTITUTED A SERVICE REWARD SCHEME WHEREBY THE COMPANY PAYS 5 PER CENT OF A MANS WEEKLY SALARY IF HE IS NEITHER ABSENT NOR LATE DURING THE WEEK THIS SERVICE REWARD IS PAID FOUR WEEKS AFTER IT IS EARNED PROVIDING OF COURSE THE MAN IS STILL IN THEIR EMPLOY AT THE OUTSET ONLY 69 PER CENT OF THE FORCE QUALIFIED FOR THIS BONUS AT THE PRESENT ABOUT 81 PER CENT QUALIFY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ABSENCE AND LATENESS HAS BEEN CUT FROM 46 PER CENT TO 33 PER CENT IT IS PERHAPS WELL TO BEAR IN MIND IN THIS CONNECTION THAT LABOR CONDITIONS IN BRIDGEPORT HAVE BEEN ABOUT AS ACUTE AS IN ANY CITY IN THE UNION THE BONUSES MENTIONED SO FAR HAVE SIMPLY BEEN CASH PAYMENTS SOME CONCERNS GO EVEN FURTHER THE A M COLLINS MANUFAC TURING COMPANY FOR EXAMPLE DECIDED UPON A PREMIUM OF A WEEKS VACATION WITH FULL PAY TO EVERY WOMAN EMPLOYE WHO DURING THE YEAR HAD NOT LOST MORE THAN TEN FULL DAYS THE SATURDAY HALF DAY IS COUNTED AS A FULL DAY ABSENCE IS EXCUSED IN CASES OF SICKNESS IF A DOCTORS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED THE COMPANY FEELS THAT WHILE ALL THE EMPLOYES SHOULD HAVE A VACATION THE RESULTS ARE MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL WHEN THE EMPLOYE KNOWS THAT THE TIME HE IS LOSING IS NOT COSTING HIM MONEY FORTY PER CENT OF THE EMPLOYES OF THIS CONCERN NOW RECEIVE A VACATION WITH PAY THE LEEDS AND NORTHRUP COM PANY GIVE A BONUS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR EXTRA EACH DAY IE AN HOUR AND A HALF A WEEK TO THOSE EMPLOYES WHO ARE ON TIME EVERY DAY THEY ALSO HAVE A VACATION PLAN BASED ON SERVICE ANY PERSON WHO HAS WORKED WITH THE COMPANY FIVE YEARS IS ENTITLED TO A DAYS HOLIDAY WITH PAY FOR EACH YEAR HE HAS BEEN WITH THE COMPANY THUS A SEVEN YEAR MAN WILL GET A SEVENDAY VACATION WTH PAY ANY TIME HE CHOOSES BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER THE FOREMEN AND OFFICE FORCE ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR VACATIONSAND IN THEIR CASES THESE DAYS ARE EXTRA FOR IN ANY CASE THEY RECEIVE A TWO WEEKS VACATION WITH PAY AT SUCH TIMES AS THEY SEE FIT A DAY AT A TIME THIS OF COURSE GIVES THEM A FEELING THATTHEY ARE ON THEIR OWN TIME AND NOT ASKING ANY 151THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FAVOR OF THE COMPANY OVER 50 PER CENT OF THE PRESENT FORCE HAS BEEN WITH THIS FIRM FIVE YEARS THE CURTIS PUBLISHING COMPANY AS A RECOGNITION OF SATISFAC TORY SERVICE BASED ON UNUSUALLY GOOD ATTENDANCE OR PROMPTNESS GIVES OUT EACH YEAR A SERIES OF TOKENS AS AWARDS THIS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF THE ORIGINAL OF A PAINTING REPRODUCED IN ONE OF ITS PUBLICATIONS OR A SET OF BOOKS IN 1915 850 AWARDS WERE GIVEN OUT ONE HUN DRED AND FIFTYSIX OF THE FORCE WERE NEITHER LATE NOR ABSENT FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTYTHREE EMPLOYES WERE NOT LATE DURING THE YEAR AND 92 HAD A PERFECT ATTENDANCE RECORD TWENTY EMPLOYES OF THIS CONCERN HAVE BEEN NEITHER LATE NOR ABSENT FOR FIVE YEARS THE KERITE CABLE COMPANY GIVES TURKEYS TO MANY OF ITS EMPLOYES EACH CHRISTMAS SEVERAL OTHER CONCERNS WHILE THEY HAVE NO BONUS SYSTEM AT PRESENT ARE CONTEMPLATING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ONE IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE DENNISON MANUFACTURING COMPANY IS CONTEMPLATING TO PAY A BONUS FOR PERFECT ATTENDANCE OVER A PERIOD OF SIX WEEKS THEY EXPECT TO PAY THIS IN A PAY WEEK IN WHICH A HOLIDAY OCCURS WHICH WOULD VIRTUALLY GIVE ALL HOUR WORKERS A CHANCE TO PAY THEM SELVES FOR EACH HOLIDAY SIMPLY BY BEING PRESENT EVERY WORKING DAY FOR THIS PURPOSE THE WORKING YEAR IS DIVIDED INTO EIGHT PERIODS OF ABOUT THIRTYEIGHT DAYS EACH THE HOOD RUBBER COMPANY ALSO IS CONSIDERING GIVING A BONUS AND MANY OTHERS HAVE PLANS IN THE MAKING ANOTHER FACTOR RANGED ON THE PREVENTIVE SIDE IS THAT OF HOME VISITING THIS METHOD SUGGESTS BOTH CURE AND PREVENTION IT MAY BE CARRIED ON AS PART OF THE WORK OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT BUT IS OFTEN DONE BY FIRMS WHICH HAVE NO REGULAR EMPLOYMENT OFFICE THE FIRST WORK OF THIS SORT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE FORD MOTOR COM PANY AND WAS AT FIRST SEVERELY CRITICIZED PARTLY FROM THE FACT AS SOME ONE HAS POINTED OUT THAT THIS CONCERN HAS THE UNFORTUNATE HABIT OF DOING THINGS FIRST BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY EVERY MORNING THE TIME DEPARTMENT TURNS OVER TO THE INVESTIGATING STAFF A LIST OF ABSENTEES OF THE PREVIOUS DAY EACH ABSENTEE IS CAREFULLY LOOKED UP THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT WHERE FORMERLY THE DAILY ABSENCES TOTALLED ABOUT 10 PER CENT THE NUMBER IS NOW LESS THAN ONE HALF OF 1 PER CENT THE CLEVELAND METAL PRODUCTS COMPANY HAS FOUND THIS SYS TEM MOST SATISFACTORY THEY EMPLOY TWO NURSES ONE OF WHOM STAYS IN THE DISPENSARY WHILE THE OTHER VISITS ABSENTEES THESE 152ABSENCE AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY NURSES ARE PROVIDED WITH AUTOMOBILES IN ORDER THAT AS MUCH TERRITORY AS POSSIBLE MAY BE COVERED THE VISITS OF ONE NURSE CUT DOWN AB SENTEES IN THIS CONCERN FROM 5 PER CENT TO 35 PER CENT AND BY EMPLOY ING TWO NURSES THE ABSENTEEISM IN 1915 WAS ONLY 19 PER CENT THE BAMBERGER DEPARTMENT STORE VISITS THE EMPLOYE IN CASES OF SICKNESS HART SCHAFFNER AND MARX FOLLOW OUT THIS SAME IDEA WORKING THROUGH THEIR MEDICAL DEPARTMENT AND HAVE FOUND THAT ONE VISIT FROM THE NURSE IS IN ALMOST ALL CASES SUFFICIENT TO REFORM THE UNNECESSARY DELINQUENT BY NO MEANS ALL OF SUCH PLANS MEET WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS WE QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM A LETTER FROM THE FISK RUBBER COMPANY THE SYSTEM WE HAD IN EFFECT WAS SATISFACTORY ENOUGH BUT THE PRINCIPLE EVI DENTLY WAS WRONG AS THE PERCENTAGE OF ABSENTEES WAS NOT CUT TO ANY EXTENT OUR PLAN OF OPERATION REQUIRED TWO NURSES TWO AUTOMOBILES WITH THE NECESSARY CHAUFFEURS AND THREE CLERKS WITH THE NECESSARY SUPERVISION AFTER A WHILE THE MEN BECAME VERY CLEVER WITH THEIR EXCFSES AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE NEVER WAS SO MUCH BOWEL TROUBLE AND HEADACHES SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN TO MUCH TIME AND MONEY ARE CONSUMED BY THE ENDEAVOR TO VISIT ALL ABSENTEES I THINK THE PROPER WAY TO HANDLE THIS WOULD BE THROUGH A LABOR TRACER ETC THE WORK OF EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENTS MUST NOT BE OVERLOOKED AS AN ELEMENT IN THE OUNCE OF PREVENTION MANY OF THESE TODAY CARRY ON PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS WHICH DETERMINE THE PHYSICAL STATUS OF A MAN BEFORE HE EVER TAKES A JOB AND THEN TO MAINTAIN HIS FITNESS AFTER HE HAS COME TO WORK THE JOSEPH AND FEISS COMPANY MAIN TAIN A PHYSICIAN AN OCULIST AND A DENTIST FOR THESE PURPOSES ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE OPERATION OF AN EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT IS THE FOLLOWING UP OF THE WORK OF A MAN AFTER HE HAS TAKEN A POSITION THUS THE COUPLING OF THE RIGHT MAN TO THE RIGHT JOB RELIEVES A GREAT DEAL OF THAT DISCONTENT WHICH FOSTERS SO MANY INDUSTRIAL ILLS UN FORTUNATELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MEASURE DISCONTENT IN FIGURES BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT A MAN CONTENTED WITH HIS JOB AND SURROUNDINGS IS APT TO WORK MORE STEADILY THAN ONE WHO IS NOT WE HEAR A GREAT DEAL IN THESE DAYS ABOUT SAFETY FIRST THE APPLICATION OF THIS SLOGAN TO INDUSTRY HAS MEANT THE MATERIAL CUTTING DOWN OF ACCIDENTS AND THIS HAS MEANT THE REDUCTION OF ABSENCES FOR INSTANCE IN TWO HUGE STEEL PLANTS OF APPROXIMATELY THE SAME SIZE PLANT A HAS USED METHODS TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS PLANT X HAS USED NONE IN PLANT X IN THE STEEL WORKS THE NUMBER OF DAYS LOST 153THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PER MAN OVER A PERIOD OF THREE HUNDRED WORKING DAYS IS 169 PER CENT IN PLANT A THIS PERCENTAGE IS ONLY 47 PER CENT IN THE YARDS OF PLANT X THE AVERAGE DAILY LOSS IS 42 PER CENT WHILE IN PLANT A IT IS JUST HALF THAT OR 21 PER CENT IN THIS CAMPAIGN OF SAFETY FIRST THE WORKMENS COMPENSATION ACT HAS BEEN THE LARGEST SINGLE FACTOR IN THE REDUCTION OF ACCIDENTS THE PREVENTION OF UNNECESSARY FATIGUE HAS SOME BEARING ON OUR PROBLEM AS IT AVOIDS LATENESS AND PERHAPS ABSENCE DURING THE NEXT WORKING PERIOD THE JOSEPH AND FEISS COMPANY COMBATS FATIGUE BY A CHANGE OF WORK AT GIVEN PERIODS A CERTAIN MACHINE COMPANY SHUTS OFF ITS MACHINERY ABSOLUTELY DURING A STIPULATED PART OF EACH DAY BUT HERE AGAIN WE SIMPLY HAVE OPINIONS AND NO FIGURES THE USE OF ALCOHOL IS AN EVER TROUBLESOME PROBLEM SOME FIRMS REFUSE TO EMPLOY A DRINKING MAN IN PLANTS WHERE THERE IS NIGHT WORK AND NEARBY SALOONS IT OFTEN BECOMES A SERIOUS PROBLEM TO GET THE MEN TO RETURN TO THE SHOP ON TIME WHEN THE WORK RECOM MENCES AFTER THE SHUTDOWN AT MIDNIGHT TO COMBAT THIS CONDITION THE PHILADELPHIA PLANT OF THE BARRETT COMPANY SHUTS DOWN FOR ONLY HALF AN HOUR AT MIDNIGHT THIS TIME BEING SHORTENED AT THE OTHER END IT THEN SERVES COFFEE TO ITS EMPLOYES FREE OF CHARGE THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT OF THE SEVENTY MEN WHO USED TO GO OUT AT THIS TIME NOW ONLY FOUR LEAVE THE PREMISES IT IS POSSIBLE THAT DESIRABLE LUNCH ROOMS WITHIN THE FACTORY WOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT SPECIFIC EFFORTS TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM OF LATENESS AND ABSENCE ARE THINGS OF SUCH RECENT ORIGIN THAT MANY OF THEM SEEM OF MORE THEORETICAL THAN PRACTICAL VALUE IN ATTACKING THE PROBLEM IT IS WELL TO POINT OUT THAT IT IS NOT SUGGESTED THAT THE PERSONAL LIBERTIES OF ANY EMPLOYE SHALL BE INTERFERED WITH IT IS THE AVOIDABLE AND UN NECESSARY ABSENCE AND LATENESS THAT ARE THE OBJECTS OF ATTACK THE DIFFICULTIES OF STUDYING THE GENERAL PROBLEM MAY BE SUMMED UP IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH OF A RECENT LETTER FROM A LARGE SILK MILL IT IS TYPICAL IN REPLY TO YOUR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AS TO LATENESS AND ABSENCE AT THIS PLANT WE MUST STATE THAT WHILE WE ARE AT PRESENT EMPLOYING A TIME KEEPING SYSTEM WHICH ADEQUATELY INFORMS US AS TO THESE FACTORS WE HAVE NOT TO DATE ACCUMULATED SUFFICIENT DATA TO BE OF PRACTICAL VALUE TO YOU IN YOUR PRESENT QUEST IF WE COULD OFFER YOU OUR SEASONED INFORMATION A YEAR FROM DATE WE SHOULD BE GLAD TO BE OF ANY POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE 154ABSENCE AND LATENESS IN INDUSTRY 155 THE NUCLEUS OF THIS AND OF MANY SIMILAR LETTERS LIES IN THE LAST SENTENCE WITH SEASONED DATA COMES ACTION AND FROM THE PRESENT INDICATIONS OF THIS NEWER CONCEPTION OF THE RELATIONS OF EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYE WE TAKE THE LIBERTY TO ASSUME THAT IN THIS ACTION WE SHALL FIND CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR OUR SECOND HERESY THAT THE ABSENT ARE NOT OF NECESSITY GUILTY AND LESSENED EVIDENCE FOR OUR FIRST THAT THE ABSENT ARE NOT OF NECESSITY CONSPICUOUS

J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109560,THE BAKERIAN LECTURE OBSERVATIONS ON THE QUANTITY OF HORIZONTAL REFRACTION WITH A METHOD OF MEASURING THE DIP AT SEA ABSTRACT,I207043,100 CENTRE WHIERE THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY CONDENSED TO PRODUCE THE APPEAR ANCE OF  NUCLEUS THESE WE ARE TOLD ARE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OB JECTS THAT CAN BE SEEN IN THE HEAVENS 7 NEBUL6ETHESE IT IS THOUGHT MAY BE RESOLVED INTO THE THREE LASTMENTIONED SPECIES ONLY REMOVED TO SUCH A DISTANCE THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE SEEN BY MEANS OF THE MOST POWERFUL TELESCOPES 8 STARS WITH BURRS STELLAR NEBULETHESE ARE THOUGHT TO BE CLUSTERS OF STARS AT GREAT DISTANCES THE LIGHT OF WHICH IS GATHERED SO NEARLY INTO ONE POINT AS TO LEAVE BUT JUST ENOUGH OF IT VISIBLE TO PRO DUCE THE APPEARANCE OF BURRS 9 MILKY NEBULOSITIESTHESE PHAENOMENA ARE PROBABLY OF TWO DIFFERENT KINDS ONE OF THEM BEING DECEPTIONS NAMELY SUCH AS ARISE FROM EXTENSIVE REGIONS OF CLOSELY CONNECTED CLUSTERING STARS CONTIGU OUS TO EACH OTHER LIKE THOSE THAT COMPOSE OUR MILKY WAY THE OTHER ON THE CONTRARY BEING REAL AND POSSIBLY AT NO VERY GREAT DISTANCE FROM US THE MILKY NEBULOSITY OF ORION DISCOVERED BY HUYGENS IS GIVEN AS AN INSTANCE OF THIS SINGULAR APPEARANCE 10 NEBULOUS STARSWHETHER THESE BE THE EFFECT OF THE ATMO SPHERES OF CERTAIN STARS REMAINS YET TO BE DETERMINED AND INDEED EVERY THING RESPECTING THE NATURE OF THESE APPEARANCES IS STILL IN VOLVED IN MUCH DOUBT AND OBSCURITY 11 PLANETARY NEBULE AND 12 PLANETARY NEBULAE WITH CENTRES THESE ALSO THOUGH OBJECTS MANIFESTLY DISTINCT FROM THE FORMER ONES ARE AS YET SO IMPERFECTLY KNOWN AS TO BAFFLE ALL REASONING CONCERNING THEIR NATURE AND HABITS AND DR HERSCHEL CONTENTS HIMSELF FOR THE PRESENT WITH MERELY INSERTING THE FEW HE HAS OBSERVED IN HIS CATA LOGUE HERE FOLLOWS THE COPIOUS CATALOGUE OF NEBULAE C WHICH BEING A CONTINUATION OF TWO PRECEDING PAPERS OF THE LIKE NATURE AND ARRANGED IN THE SAME MANNER REQUIRES NO FURTHER EXPLANATION THE BAKERIAN LECTURE OBSERVATIONS ON THE QUANTITY OF HORIZONTAL REFRACTION WITH A METHOD OF MEASURING THE DIP AT SEA BY WIL LIAM HYDE WOLLASTON MD FRS READ NOVEMBER 11 1802 PHIL TRANS 1803 P 1 IN A COMMUNICATION ON THIS SUBJECT PUBLISHED IN THE VOLUME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1800 DR WOLLASTON AC COUNTED FOR VARIOUS SINGULAR PHENOMENA OF HORIZONTAL REFRACTION BY CERTAIN GRADUAL CHANGES IN THE DENSITY OF THE REFRACTING MEDIUM HAV ING SINCE PERUSED WHAT M MONGE HAS PUBLISHED IN THE MEMOIRES SUR LEGYPTE CONCERNING THE APPEARANCE KNOWN TO THE FRENCH BY THE NAME OF MIRAGE WHERE IT IS ASCRIBED TO PERMANENT RAREFIED STRATA OF AIR NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH OUR AUTHOR HAVING RECONSIDERED THE SUBJECT AND FINDING THAT THE FACTS RELATED BY THE FRENCH PHILO SOPHER ACCORD ENTIRELY WITH HIS OWN THEORY DECLARES HERE THAT HE STILL ADHERES TO HIS FORMER OPINION AND ASSIGNS HIS REASONS FOR NOT DE PARTING FROM IT THE CHIEF OF THESE REASONS IS THAT THE DEFINITE REFLECTING SURFACE101 WHICH M MONGE SUPPOSES TO TAKE PLACE BETWEEN TWO STRATA OF AIR OF DIFFERENT DENSITY IS BY NO MEANS CONSISTENT WITH THAT CONTINUED ASCENT OF RAREFIED AIR WHICH HE HIMSELF ADMITS AND THAT THE EXPLA NATION FOUNDED ON THIS HYPOTHESIS WILL NOT APPLY TO OTHER CASES WHICH MAY ALL BE SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR UPON THE SUPPOSITION OF A GRADUAL CHANGE OF DENSITY AND SUCCESSIVE CURVATURE OF THE RAYS OF LIGHT BY REFRACTION THE SUBJECT BEING OF FAR GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN MAY AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR SINCE THE VARIATIONS IN THE DIP OF THE APPARENT HORIZON ON WHICH ALL OBSERVATIONS OF ALTITUDE AT SEA NECESSARILY DEPEND MUST BE INFLUENCED BY THIS VARIABLE REFRACTION OUR AUTHOR HAS BEEN VIGILANT IN AVAILING HIMSELF OF EVERY INCIDENT THAT MIGHT SERVE TO THROW SOME LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT AMONG THESE THE FIRST THAT OCCURRED WAS AN AP PEARANCE HE SAW ON THE RIVER THAMES WHEN BEING SEATED IN A BOAT WITH HIS EYE ABOUT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER HE PER CEIVED THE OARS OF BARGES AT SOME DISTANCE BENDING INWARDS THE POINT OF CURVATURE OR ANGLE TAKING PLACE AT A SMALL HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEN SIBLE HORIZON HE NOW RECOLLECTED THAT THE WARMTH OF THE SUMMER HAVING BEEN VERY CONSIDERABLE THE TEMPERATURE THE WATER HAD ACQUIRED AND STILL RETAINED WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE HAD BECOME COOLER MUST OCCASION A RAREFACTION OF THE STRATUM OF AIR ABOVE ITS SURFACE GREATER THAN THOSE AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS THIS LED HIM TO A SERIES OF FURTHER OBSERVATIONS WHICH HE HAS COL LECTED IN A TABLE FROM WHICH WE LEARN THAT TAKING IN LIKEWISE THE HYGROMETRICAL CHANGES IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE DEPRESSION OF THE HORIZON IS GREATER THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IS ABOVE THAT OF THE AIR BUT THAT THIS DEPRESSION IS MATERIALLY DIMINISHED BY THE INCREASING DRYNESS OF THE AIR THAT THESE REFRACTIONS WHICH IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED OBSERVATIONS WERE BY NO MEANS AT ALL TIMES CONSISTENT MUST BE AFFECTED BY THE VICINITY OF LAND INFLUENCING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WILL BE EASILY ADMITTED AND HENCE THE OBSERVATIONS AT SEA MAY IT IS THOUGHT AF FORD SOME MORE ACCURATE CONCLUSIONS THOUGH THE QUANTITY OF DEPRES SION MAY NOT BE SO GREAT THUS MUCH HOWEVER IS EVIDENT THAT THE ERROR IN NAUTICAL OBSERVATIONS ARISING FROM A SUPPOSITION THAT THE HORIZON IS INVARIABLY ACCORDING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE OBSERVER STANDS GREATLY IN NEED OF CORRECTION HOW TO APPLY THIS CORRECTION IS THE OBJECT OF THE CLOSE OF THIS PAPER THIS CONSISTS IN MEASURING BY A BACK OBSERVATION THE WHOLE VERTICAL ANGLE BETWEEN ANY TWO OPPOSITE POINTS OF THE HORIZON EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER TAKING AN ALTITUDE AND CALCULATING HALF THE EXCESS OF THIS ANGLE ABOVE 180 WHICH WILL OF COURSE BE THE DIP REQUIRED A FEW CAUTIONS ARE LASTLY GIVEN FOR CORRECTING SOME INACCURACIES IN THE INSTRUMENTS ESPECIALLY THE INDEX ERROR IN THE BACK OBSERVATIONS WHICH IT IS OWNED HAD BEEN SOME YEARS SINCE SUGGESTED BY MR LUDLAM

THE UNITED STATES INVOLVED THE QUESTION OF THE TAXABILITY AS INCOME OF A DIVI DEND CONSISTING OF STOCK IN A CORPORATION OTHER THAN THE DECLARING CORPORATION IN EISNER V MACOMBER2 IT WAS HELD FOUR JUDGES DISSENTING THAT WHERE A DIVIDEND WAS ISSUED IN STOCK OF THE DECLAR ING COMPANY SUCH A TRANSACTION WAS NO MORE THAN A BOOK ADJUST MENT IN ESSENCE NOT A DIVIDEND BUT RATHER THE OPPOSITE S THAT THE HOLDINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL STOCKHOLDERS WERE NOT INCREASED THEREBY SINCE BY THE INCREASE IN NUMBER OF SHARES THERE WAS A CONSEQUENT PROPORTIONATE DIMINUTION OF THE VALUE OF EACH AND THAT THE ACCUMU LATED PROFITS OF THE CORPORATION SO FAR FROM BEING DISTRIBUTED TO THE STOCKHOLDERS WERE PERMANENTLY CAPITALIZED AND MADE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF THE BUSINESSA PROCEEDING ENTIRELY FOREIGN TO THE

THAT WHERE A DIVIDEND IS IN STOCK OF THE DECLARING CORPORATION IT IS NOT INCOME AND THEREFORE NOT TAXABLE THE CASE PRESENTLY TO BE DIS CUSSED WAS ONE IN WHICH A DIVIDEND WAS ISSUED IN THE STOCK OF AN OTHER COMPANY BEFORE CONSIDERING THE LATTER LET US SEE THE ATTI TUDE OF THE COURT TOWARD THE TAXATION OF STOCK DIVIDENDS BEFORE AND AFTER THE INCOME TAX ACT OF 1916 TOWNE V EISNER S WAS A CASE WHICH AROSE BEFORE THE ACT OF 1916 AT WHICH TIME THE LAW MADE NO SPECIAL PROVISION FOR THE TAXATION OF STOCK DIVIDENDS THE COURT HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN DECIDING THAT SINCE CONGRESS DID NOT MENTION STOCK DIVIDENDS AS COMING WITHIN THE PUR VIEW OF THE INCOME TAX ACT OF 1913 SUCH DIVIDENDS WERE NOT TAX ABLE ON THE GROUND THAT THEY WERE CAPITAL RATHER THAN INCOME BUT CONGRESS WAS NOT SLOW TO INDICATE ITS DISPOSITION TO TAX DIVI DENDS IN STOCK OF THE DECLARING CORPORATION BEFORE THE ABOVE CASE WAS DECIDED THE ACT OF 1916 WAS PASSED SPECIFICALLY PROVIDING FOR THE TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS AND DEFINING THEM AS ANY DISTRIBUTION MADE OR ORDERED TO BE MADE WHETHER IN CASH OR IN STOCK OF THE CORPORA TION JOINT STOCK COMPANY ASSOCIATION OR INSURANCE COMPANY WHICH STOCK DIVIDEND SHALL BE CONSIDERED INCOME TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS CASH VALUE 6 IN EISNER V MACOMBER 7 THE COURT WAS CALLED UPON TO DE TERMINE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS ACT CONSTRUING IT THE COURT HELD THAT INASMUCH AS CONGRESS DERIVES ITS POWER TO LEGISLATE FROM THE CONSTITUTION ALONE IT CANNOT GO BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE CON STITUTION IN EXERCISING THIS POWER AND THAT NO MERE ASSERTION OF CONGRESS CAN MAKE THAT INCOME WHICH IS NOT SUCH IN FACT IN OTHER WORDS THE ACT OF 1916 WAS DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN SO FAR AS IT CALLED FOR THE TAXATION OF STOCK DIVIDENDS AND THE CLAIMANT WAS EX EMPTED AS IN THE EARLIER CASE8 IN UNITED STATES V

DEBENTURE STOCK OF THE NEW CONCERN TO LIQUI DATE ITS BONDS RETIRE ITS PREFERRED STOCK AND COVER ITS COMMON STOCK WHICH THE STOCKHOLDERS RETAINED IN ADDITION THE NEW JERSEY COR PORATION PAID TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS TWO SHARES OF THE COMMON STOCK OF THE DELAWARE COMPANY FOR EACH SHARE OF THE OLD COMMON STOCK HELD BY THEN THE STOCKHOLDERS AND OFFICERS OF THE TWO CONCERNS WERE IDENTICAL AND THE OLD COMPANY DID NO BUSINESS THEREAFTER IT WAS HELD THAT THE CLAIMANTS STOCK IN THE NEW CORPORATION DISTRIBUTED TO HIM AS A SHAREHOLDER OF THE OLD WAS INCOME AND TAXABLE AS SUCH10 SHAREHOLDER REMAINS THE SAME THE ONLY CHANGE IS IN THE EVIDENCE WHICH REPRESENTS THAT INTEREST THE NEW SHARES AND THE ORIGINAL SHARES TOGETHER REPRESENTING THE SAME PROPORTIONAL INTEREST THAT THE ORIGINAL SHARES REP RESENTED

WHEREIN A CAPITAL INTEREST IN A CORPORATION WAS DISPOSED OF AT A FIGURE GREAER THAN THE VALUE OF SUCH CAPITAL INTER 446THE FACTS OF THIS CASE DIFFERED FROM THOSE OF EISNER V MA COMBER 11 ONLY IN THIS THAT THE DIVIDEND WAS ISSUED IN THE STOCK OF ANOTHER COMPANY RATHER THAN THE EXISTING ONE THEREFORE SINCE THE CLAIMANT WAS TAXED ON HIS LIVIDEND IN THE LATER CASE AND EXEMPTED IN THE EARLIER THE COURT MUST HAVE DISTINGUISHED THE LATER CASE ON THE GROUND OF THE SEPARATENESS OF THE CORPORATION WHICH DECLARED THE DIVIDEND FROM THE CORPORATION IN WHICH THE DIVIDEND WAS PAY ABLE TWO EXCERPTS FROM THE OPINION SHOW THAT THIS WAS THE REAL QUESTION INVOLVED IN SPEAKING OF THE ISSUE OF STOCK IN THE DELA WARE CORPORATION IT WAS SAID 12 BUT WHEN THIS COMMON STOCK WAS DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF THE OLD COMPANY AS A DIVIDEND THEN AT ONCE UNLESS THE TWO COLMPANICS BE REGARDED AS SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL THE INDIVIDUAL STOCKHOLDERS OF THE OLD COMPANY INCLUDING CLAIMANT RECEIVED ASSETS OF EXCHANGEABLE AND ACTUAL VALUE SEV ERED FROM THEIR CAPITAL INTEREST IN THE OLD COMPANY PROCEEDED FROM IT AS THE RESULT OF A DIVISION OF FORMER CORPORATE PROFITS AND DRAWN BY THEM SEVERALLY FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL AND SEPARATE USE AND BENEFIT SUCH A GAIN RESULTING FROM THEIR OWNERSHIP OF STOCK IN THE OLD COMPANY AND PROCEEDING FROM IT CONSTI TUTED INDIVIDUAL INCOME IN THE PROPER SENSE

PREMISE VIZ THE SEPARATENESS OF THE TWO CORPORATIONS WAS WARRANTED IT IS EVIDENT THAT IF THE NEW JERSEY AND DELAWARE COMPANIES WERE DISTINCT THE DIVIDEND RECEIVED BY CLAIMANT WAS A GAIN A PROFIT DERIVED FROM HIS CAPITAL INTEREST IN THE OLD COMPANY NOT IN LIQUIDATION OF THE CAP ITAL BUT IN DISTRIBUTION OF ACCUMULATED PROFITS OF THE COMPANY 14 IT IS EQUALLY OBVIOUS THAT IF THEY WERE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL THE EST ON MARCH 1 1913 THE PROFIT WAS HELD TO BE TAXABLE AS INCOME MER CHANTS LOAN AND TRUST CO V SMIETANKA 255 U S 509 1921 ELDORADO COAL  MINING CO V MAGER 255 U S 522 1921

1918 NOTES 447VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW DISTRIBUTION OF STOCK WAS MERELY AN INCREASE OF CAPITAL HOLDINGS AND IN NO SENSE INCOMES THE PERPLEXING QUESTION IS THE INTERPRETATION OF AND THE RESULT FLOWING FROM THE ACT BY WHICH THE DELAWARE CORPORATION CAME INTO BEING WAS IT IN FACT A DISTINCT COMPANY IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE SEPARATENESS WAS MORE IN FORM THAN IN SUBSTANCE THE NAME OF THE NEW CORPORATION WAS THE E I DU PONT DE NEMOURS  CO WHILE THE OLD COMPANY WAS KNOWN AS THE E I DU PONT DE NEMOURS POWDER CO SO FAR AS APPEARS THE PUR POSES OF THE NEW CONCERN DIFFERED IN NO RESPECT FROM THOSE OF THE OLD THE FACT THAT THE NEW COMPANY HAD AN AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK MUCH LARGER THAN THAT OF THE OLD WOULD SEEM TO BE IMMATERIAL ALTHOUGH URGED BY THE COURT THE COURT MAKES MUCH OF THE FACT THAT THE DELAWARE CORPORATION WAS FORMED UNDER THE LAWS OF A DIFFERENT STATE WHICH NECESSARILY IMPORTS A DIFFERENT MEASURE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC AND PRESUMABLY DIFFERENT RIGHTS BETWEEN THE STOCKHOLDERS AND COMPANY AND BETWEEN STOCKHOLDERS INTER SESE THAN BEFORE 16 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HOWEVER IN ANOTHER CASE 17 DE DECIDED THE SAME DAY WHERE A NEW COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED IN THE SAME STATE AS AN OLD ONE THE IMPORTANCE IN THE INSTANT CASE AT TACHED TO THE DIVERSITY OF STATES OF INCORPORATION WAS PASSED OVER IN SILENCE ON PRINCIPLE THE POINT SEEMS IRRELEVANT IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS AND OFFICERS OF THE TWO COMPANIES WERE IDENTICAL IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE HOW THIS POINT WHICH SEEMS TO US TO BE MATERIAL WAS REGARDED BY THE COURT THE COURT SEEMS TO TREAT THE IDENTITY AS NOTHING MORE THAN A COIN CIDENCE HOLDING THAT WHILE THERE WAS NO PRESENT CHANGE OF OFFICERS OR STOCKHOLDERS A CONTINUATION OF IDENTITY IN THIS RESPECT DEPENDED UPON CONTINUED UNANIMOUS CONSENT OR CONCURRENT ACTION OF A MULTI TUDE OF INDIVIDUAL STOCKHOLDERS ACTUATED BY MOTIVES AND INFLUENCES NECESSARILY TO SOME EXTENT DIVERGENT 18 THE ATTEMPT IS THUS MADE TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE INITIAL IDENTITY OF OFFICERS AND STOCKHOLDERS BY AFFIRMING THAT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE THE POSSIBILITY IF NOT THE CERTAINTY OF A CHANGE IN THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE DELAWARE COR PORATION IS TO BE ADMITTED BUT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE PERSONNEL OF THE DELAWARE CORPORATION AS A CRITERION BY WHICH TO PASS UPON ITS IDENTITY WITH THE NEW JERSEY COMPANY DOES NOT SEEM SOUND IT MIGHT AS WELL BE ARGUED THAT A CORPORATION IS NOT IDENTICAL WITH IT SELF AFTER ONE OF THE ORIGINAL STOCKHOLDERS HAS DISPOSED OF HIS INTER EST TO A THIRD PERSON BUT IT IS FUNDAMENTAL IN THE LAW OF CORPORA TIONS THAT THE IDENTITY OF A CORPORATION IS NOT LISTURBED BY A CHANGE HOWEVER EXTENSIVE IN THE PERSONNEL OF ITS MEMBERS19 ONLY ONE CASE IS CITED AS AUTHORITY FOR THE POSITION TAKEN  SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY V LOWE 247 U S 330

MEMBERSHIP TO THE RIVER THAMES WHICH IS STILL THE SAME RIVER THOUGH THE PARTS WHICH COMPOSE IT ARE CHANGING EVERY INSTANT 1 BL COM 468 PEABODY Z EISNER SUPRA 448NOTES THERE THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY WHICH HAD LARGE HOLD INGS IN THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD COMPANY PAID TO ITS STOCK HOLDERS A DIVIDEND PART OF WHICH CONSISTED OF PREFERRED AND COM MON STOCK OF THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO THIS STOCK WAS PROPERLY HELD INCOME SINCE THE DIVIDEND OF BALTIMORE AND OHIO SHARES WAS NOT A STOCK DIVIDEND BUT A DISTRIBUTION IN SPECIE OF A PORTION OF THE ASSETS OF THE UNION PACIFIC AND IS TO BE GOVERNED FOR ALL PRESENT PURPOSES BY THE SAME RULE APPLICABLE TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF A LIKE VALUE OF MONEY 21 BUT THE UNION PACIFIC AND THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO WERE ADMITTEDLY DISTINCT CORPORATIONS SO THAT THE CITATION OF THIS CASE AS AUTHORITY FOR THE PHELLIS CASE WHEREIN THE IDENTITY OF THE CORPORATIONS IS THE MOOTED QUESTION SEEMS TO BE A VERY FREE USE OF JUDICIAL CONSTRUCTION THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT FOR THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER OF THE DEL AWARE COMPANY WAS THE FACT THAT THE CLAIMANT COULD DISPOSE OF ANY OR ALL OF HIS STOCK THEREIN WITHOUT LOSING HIS CAPITAL INTEREST IN THE NEW JERSEY CONCERN THIS IS NOT TRUE AS POINTED OUT BY THE COURT IF THE DIVIDEND IS ISSUED IN STOCK OF THE DECLARING CORPORATION TO ILLUSTRATE SUPPOSE A STOCKHOLDER HAS 100 OF THE 1000 SHARES OF A CORPORATION WHOSE CAPITAL STOCK IS 100000 THIS IS A ONETENTH INTEREST NOW SUPPOSE THAT THE COMPANY DECLARES A 200 DIVIDEND PAYABLE IN ITS OWN STOCK HE WOULD THEN HAVE 300 SHARES IN A COR PORATION WHOSE CAPITAL STOCK IS 300000STILL A ONETENTH INTEREST IF HOWEVER HE SHOULD SELL HALF OF HIS NEW SHARES HIS INTEREST WOULD BE REDUCED TO ONEFIFTEENTH IN ORDER TO RETAIN HIS ONETENTH IN TEREST HE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO KEEP ALL HIS NEW STOCK NOW CHANGE THE FACTS BY SUPPOSING THAT THE 200 DIVIDEND IS IN THE STOCK OF ANOTHER CORPORATION HE WOULD THEN HAVE A ONETENTH INTEREST IIN EACH COMPANY BUT THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH INTEREST IN THE OLD COM PANY WOULD NOT DEPEND UPON HIS RETAINING THE NEW SHARES IN THE ILLUSTRATIONS JUST GIVEN THE PHELLIS CASE FALLS UNDER THE SEC OND HEAD IT WAS UPON THE FACT THAT THE CLAIMANT COULD SELL ANY OR ALL OF HIS NEW SHARES WITHOUT IMPAIRING HIS CAPITAL INTEREST IN THE NEW JERSEY COMPANY THAT THE COURT DISTINGUISHED THIS CASE FROM THAT OF EISNER V MACOMBER22 THIS IS TRUE IF HIS CAPITAL INTEREST IN THE OLD CORPORATION IS THE ONE THAT SHOULD GOVERN BUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE REAL CORPORATION IN SUBSTANCE AFTER THE REORGANIZATION WAS THE DELAWARE COMPANY AND THAT THE CLAIMANTS REAL CAPITAL IN TEREST WAS THE STOCK IN THIS COMPANY ISSUED TO HIM AND WHY THE NEW JERSEY COMPANY EXISTED MERELY IN NAME THEREAFTER IT DID NO FURTHER BUSINESS ITS STOCK DROPPED FROM 795 TO 100THE DIFFERENCE BEING TAKEN UP BY THE VALUE OF THE TWO SHARES OF DELA WARE STOCKAND SINCE THE OLD COMPANY WAS NO LONGER ACTIVE THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE LITTLE HOPE OF ITS STOCK ADVANCING IF THEN THE CLAIMANTS REAL CAPITAL INTEREST WAS IN THE DELAWARE CORPORATION THE DISTINCTION WOULD NOT BE WELL FOUNDED FOR THE CLAIMANT COULD NO MORE SELL A SINGLE ONE OF HIS 200 NEW SHARES WITHOUT LESSENING HIS ONETENTH INTEREST IN THE NEW COMPANY THAN HE COULD WHERE THE  247 U S 349 350 SUPRA 449VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW DIVIDEND WAS IN STOCK OF THE DECLARING CORPORATION FROM THIS AS PECT OF THE CASE THE TRANSACTION WOULD SEEM TO BE MORE IN THE NA TURE OF A REORGANIZATION OF THE NEW JERSEY CORPORATION THAN OF THE FORMATION OF A NEW AND DISTINCT COMPANY SUCH WAS THE VIEW TAKEN IN THE DISSENTING OPINION23 SO THAT UPON VIEWING THE CASE IN ITS ENTIRETY THE ACTUAL SEPARATE NESS OF THE NEW JERSEY AND DELAWARE CORPORATIONS UPON WHICH THE SOUNDNESS OF THE DECISION RESTS MAY WELL BE QUESTIONED THE BET TER VIEW WOULD SEEM TO BE THAT OF MR THOMAS REED POWELL WHO REGARDS THE APPARENT DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER OF THE NEW COMPANY AS FORMAL ONLY HE SAYS 24 THE LAW KNOWS A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS IN WHICH ONE SUSPECTS THAT COURTS SEEK TO PRESERVE A BALANCE BY LEANING NOW TO ONE SIDE AND NOW TO ANOTHER SO IT MAY WELL BE IN DETERMINING WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN AN ADEQUATE REALIZATION OF INCOME IF THE TAXPAYER IS FAVORED IN RESPECT TO ONE TYPE OF DIVIDEND WHY NOT FAVOR THE GOVERNMENT IN RESPECT TO ANOTHER LET ONE CLOSE DECISION GO IN FAVOR OF THE HOME TEAM AND THE NEXT IN FAVOR OF THE VISITORS S M G DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER BY MUNICIPAL CORPORA TIONSIT IS A WELL SETTLED DOCTRINE OF THE LAW OF MUNICIPAL CORPORA TIONS THAT ANY ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF SUCH A CORPORATION TO DELEGATE ITS POWER TO INDIVIDUALS IS VOID BUT WHEN SUCH A DELEGATION OC CURS AND WHAT CONSTITUTES A DELEGATION IN THE PROHIBITED SENSE IS A QUESTION WITH WHICH THE COURTS HAVE HAD ENDLESS TROUBLE ORDINANCES REGULATING THE ERECTION OF BUILDINGS AT THE REQUEST OR WITH THE CONSENT OF ADJOINING PROPERTY OWNERS PRESENT MANY NICE QUESTIONS BEFORE THE COURTS WITH CONFLICTING RESULTS SOME CASES ARE IN DIRECT CONFLICT WHILE FROM OTHERS SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES MIGHT BE DRAWN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECIDED IN 1912 THAT A MUNICI PAL ORLINANCE PROVIDING THAT THE COMMITTEE ON STREETS SHOULD UPON A WRITTEN REQUEST OF TWOTHIRDS OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS ESTABLISH A BUILDING LINE WITHIN WHICH ALL STRUCTURES MUST BE ERECTED WAS IN VALID AS A DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY2 THIS WAS A CLEAR CASE OF DELE GATION THE COMMITTEE WAS POWERLESS UNTIL THE INDIVIDUAL PROP 23 JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS VIEW CONFORMED TO THAT OF THE COURT OF CLAIMS WHICH SAID WE THINK THE WHOLE TRANSACTION IS TO BE REGARDED AS MERELY A FINANCIAL REORGANIZATION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AND THAT THIS VIEW IS JUSTIFIED BY THE POWER AND DUTY OF THE COURT TO LOOK THROUGH THE FORM OF THE TRANSACTION TO ITS SUBSTANCE 42 SUP CT 63 68 24 35 HARVARD LAW REVIEW

in Brooklyn equipped with these cells has made over eighty miles with one charge a record which has not been equalled although the distance a car can go does not determine the value of the battery used since the very important question of weight should enter and in this case the weight is over five thou sand pounds The Detroit cells have been recently tested at the Johns Hopkins University and a few figures as to their perform ance will be of interest Taking a cell with I5 plates of which the total weight is 80 pounds the following results were obtained charge rate I5 amperes discharge rate 20 ampSres storage capacity about 220 ampere hours efficiency between 75 and 80 per cent This cell after experiments at normal charge and discharge rates had been made was charged at a rate of from 75 to 85 am peres and discharged at over 250 amperes and this was done a number of times At the end of the tests there were no signs of deterioration which considering the rough usage to which the cell had been subjected speaks well for their durability although the length of the experiments was not sufficient to test their length of life under normal conditions THE MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF NICKEL Professor Ewing whose researches on the magnetic properties of iron are so well known has examined the magnetization of nickel under various conditions He finds that nickel behaves very much as iron does when submitted to a magnetizing force The permeability or magnetic conductivity is small at first then increases to a maxi mum then decreases again The maximum value of the induction obtained was 5380 so that nickel is about onequarter as magnetic as iron When a piece of nickel was heated to redness and then allowed to cool slowly in the air its permeability increased On stretching a piece of nickel its permeability decreased rapidly For example a certain specimen of wire had a value of the maxi mum magnetic susceptibility for no load of I5 With a load of 13 pounds this was reduced to 26 while at 26 pounds it was but 95 On submitting specimens to compression the reverse effect was found as the pressure increased the magnetic susceptibility in creased from 56 at no load to 290 at a load of 45 pounds per square millimeter A CHALLENGE TO THE WESTINGHOUSE COMPANY  Mr Harold P Brown has issued a challenge to the Westinghouse Electric Lighting Company to a competitive test of the apparatus of that company against a corresponding continuouscurrent plant Each company is to provide a plant capable of furnishing 65o lights These are to be sent to the Testing Bureau of the Johns Hopkins University where they are to be tested for efficiency The loser is to purchase the winning plant which is to be presented to the university and he is also to pay all of the expenses of the test If the Westinghouse Company desires it they may use one of the Westinghouse engines while Mr Brown will employ for the con tinuouscurrent plant some other make of automatic highspeed engine If the Westinghouse Company does not accept the chal lenge Mr Brown will consider himself at liberty to purchase an alternating plant and have the test made It is to be hoped that the test will be made as systematic knowledge of the performance of alternating apparatus is wanting although the marked success of the system speaks well for its efficiency THE CONDUCTIVITY OF MICA AT HIGH TEMPERATURES W H Schultze in Wiedemanns Annalen describes a number of experiments on the conductivity of mica at high temperatures It is well known that the conductivity of glass increases rapidly with the temperature a fact which in many cases is a serious inconvenience The results of Mr Schultzes experiments are that while mica split parallel to the planes of cleavage shares with glass the prop erty of becoming a better conductor as the temperature rises yet the conductivity reaches a maximum and after that diminishes until at very high temperatures it becomes infinitely small so that comparing glass and mica it is seen that even at high temperatures the latter is the better insulator A J DREXEL the banker is about to found an industrial col lege for women at Wayne Penn at a costyf I500000 VOL XIII No 324 NOTES AND NEWS SOME interesting experiments were made March 22 near Dartford with the Maxim Nordenfelt quickfiring and automatic guns As described in Engineering the first weapon fired was the Maxim automatic gun of 45 caliber and with this 334 rounds were fired in twentyseven seconds A comparative test was then made between ordinary riflepowder and the new Maxim smoke less powder A cartridge containing 85 grains of black powder and others containing 55 grains of the new powder were fired The lastmentioned cartridges gave a slightly greater velocity and at the same time produced extremely little smoke Among the other guns tried was an automatic sixpounder which has a drop ping block like the Sharpes rifle It requires only two men to work it one man firing and the other loading Every thing about the gun is fixed save the gun itself which is placed inside a jacket which latter is also fixed There can be no danger of escape of gas or from a hangfire The gun on being fired recoils about 4 inches and then returns to its original position The cartridge case is not ejected till the gun has travelled some little distance on its return journey The act of putting in the new cartridge pushes forward the ejectors and releases the block which rises and closes the breech If great rapidity is required one man on a saddle with a butt to his shoulder aims and fires while a man on each side puts in the cartridges If only one gunner is left unkilled a single man can work the gun in the following manner having laid the gun and fixed the trigger in a firing position by a bit of wood or string he simply puts in cartridge after cartridge the gun on each occasion going off as the cartridge is pushed forward It can be fired with two men to load sixty times a minute The kaolin and pottery clays of Texas are beginning to at tract considerable attention There have been representatives of several of the different Northern and Western potteries through the State during the last few weeks looking up the ordinary pot tery clays as well as the kaolin of Edwards and adjoining counties The deposits of these materials are abundant and of such quality that they are certain to be brought into market at an early day An English correspondent of the American Field writes that a new gunpowder the invention of Mr Hengst has recently been tested at the Royal Gunpowder Factory Waltham Abbey Eng land and the results point to it as a promising substitute for black powder for military and sporting purposes The new powder is prepared from straw which is pulverized chemically treated and finished in granular form for use It is claimed for this powder that it is smokeless flameless practically nonfouling and non heating and that both the recoil and the report are less than those of black powder with superior penetrative power From the pow erful character of this explosive which weight for weight is I50 per cent stronger than gunpowder and is not explodable by con cussion it is probable that in a compressed form it will be found to be applicable to blastingpurposes  President Patton says that after June I the Princeton College will have added to its permanent

England and the Argentine Republic contracted for a 4300ton ironclad Brazil laid down a cruiser and even Uruguay has contributed to the navies of the world launching a small iron gunboat The minor powers like Greece and Portugal have either contracted for or launched small vessels Turkey has begun the work of building up her navy laying down one ironclad and several smaller vessels  An article published in the Oil City Derrick recently contains some statements regarding the area and character of the illumi nating oilbearing territory which Bradstreets believes should be reassuring to believers in a possible future oilfamine in this country The oil regions as now developed the article states extend from Wellsville NY crossing Pennsylvania at nearly a 45degree line to Dunkard Creek in West Virginia On an air line this covers a distance of 204 miles in length and so far as developed the belt is about io miles in width The yield of the oilfields up to March i I889 was 340I33997 barrels About 150000000 barrels of this came from McKean County alone and this county is still good for 20000 barrels a day The total fu ture production of this belt is beyond prediction It has been noted says the article that oilbearing rock wherever found usu ally yields about the same quantity of oil to a given acre The yield of oil per square mile of territory during the first fifteen years of its existence is about 1000000 barrels It is considered certain however that each of the 204 square miles of territory will not yield this quantity If it did the total production there outlined would be about 2o400000oo barrels  This belt of 204 miles is a chain of pools large and small and until the area of each one is known the total yield would be simply conjecture The figures and estimates given relate only to the region where the illuminating oil of commerce is produced namely New York Pennsylvania and the Macksburg district in Ohio The great Lima field is not taken into account nor Colorado California Kentucky or Tennes see  It has been stated that under the energy of the drill the Ohio field might be made to yield 00ooooo barrels a day This is not improbable since the Bradford field in July i882 produced 105I102 barrels each day of that month The Bradford field had no large wells compared with the geysers of Ohio Lima oil is worth but about oneseventh as much as the Pennsylvania product and can never come into competition with it as an illuminant un less some new process of manufacture is discovered beyond any thing now known Its utility in the worlds economy lies in the direction of fuel and there is not much likelihood that it will ever be diverted from this field Natural gas is the only fuel that can compete with it in cheapness and that is not everywhere obtaina ble Natural gas cannot be transported much above ioo miles and oilfuel may be carried to the ends of the earth As far west A as Omaha it is now furnishing manufacturers a cheaper fuel than coal With the above large supplies of oil both for illuminating purposes and for fuel in sight the writer of the article apparently sees little reason to fear an oilfamine as he states it as among the immediate probabilities  John Ericsson desired that if any biography of him was un dertaken it should be intrusted to his friend Col William C Church editor of the Army and Navy Journal and the executors of the estate accordingly have turned over to Col Church all the papers which could be useful in such a work While it is true that Capt Ericsson destroyed his diary all his documents since i86o were preserved In private letters and other papers has been 299 found abundant material relative to his youth and the influences which shaped his early career Col Church will contribute

Walter Pater Hamilton Aide and Fred eric Harrison APRIL 19 I8893oo SCIENCE Mr Samuel Cabot 70 Kilby Street Boston in a letter to Building states that the cause of the white efflorescence on bricks has been recently investigated by him with the result that there are at least three different substances which cause it Of these carbonate of soda is most common upon new work after the lime stains have been removed This is due to the action of the lime mortar upon the silicate of soda in the bricks Silicate of soda seldom occurs in bricks unless the clay used is a salt clay The only other white efflorescence of importance is chiefly composed of sulphate of magnesia This is due to pyrites in the clay which when burned gives rise to sulphuric acid and the latter unites with the magnesia in the lime mortar The conclusions thus far arrived at are I the efflorescence  is never due to the bricks alone and seldom to the lime alone and 2 to avoid it the bricks should be covered with an oily preservative capable of keeping the salts from exuding Linseedoil cannot fill the requirements as it is injured by the mortar Mr Cabot wishes to investigate the matter still further and will be obliged to any architects who will send him samples of this substance say a quarterounce that may come under their observation  The directors of the Old South studies in history and politics have included in their new general series of Old South Leaflets a leaflet containing Washingtons inaugurals  the address deliv ered in New York April 30 I789 when Washington first took the oath and his address to Congress in I793 This leaflet will be especially interesting at this centennial time the first inaugural address being nowhere else so easily accessible The account of the inauguration from Irvings  Life of Washington  is appended and there are some useful notes These Old South Leaflets fur nishing so many original papers to the people in such attractive form for only five cents are a great means of education in history and politics Washingtons farewell address which as Senator Sherman recently said ought to be spread everywhere broadcast among the people is included in the series and this deserves new attention now at the time of the Washington centennial Lincolns inaugurals are given in another leaflet and it is useful to compare these with those of Washington The leaflets are published by D C Heath  Co Boston New York and Chicago  Some time ago Paulet the director of the Nanking arsenal was commissioned to procure from abroad the requisite machinery for the establishment of a foundery for smelting iron in Kueichow The machinery which weighed 1780 tons reached Shanghai in three separate consignments whence it was forwarded by boat to Nanking Owing to the rapids and shallows in the river between Changt in Hunan and its destination it had to be placed on frames and transhipped piece by piece The first consignment reached its destination early in August of last year and the re mainder followed closely afterwards A number of workmen and artisans accompanied it and arrangements having been made for putting it together and setting it up at once it was expected that the furnaces would be in working order within the year The undertaking being on a very large scale the funds raised by the issue of shares have not yet sufficed to cover the expenditure and the governor has been asked to take steps to meet the urgent demand which exists for more money Kueichow the governor explains is an extremely poor province and its only natural pro duction is iron Accordingly permission was obtained from the Throne for sending officers abroad to procure machinery for estab lishing a smeltingfurnace in the Ching district within the pre fecture of Chenyiian and thus develop the only resource the province possesses The great difficulty of inaugurating such an enterprise says the Indian Engineer is shown by the fact that two years have elapsed before the machinery could be procured from abroad It has now however arrived and been put up and the greatest part of the difficulty is over The quality of the coal and iron obtained in the district is excellent and the seams in the hills are exceedingly rich The only drawback experienced has been the difficulty of raising the money at once by shares which is no doubt due to the fact that the mercantile classes have suffered severely in the past from the insecurity attaching to scrip issued by similar companies and will not be enthusiastic in subscribing to the present undertaking until they see the furnaces actually at work VOL XIII No 324 and the iron turned out The purchase of the machinery the erec tion of the buildings and other expenses have hitherto been de frayed by loans contracted from merchants or by temporary appro priation from the likin revenue to be repaid on the receipt of the money from the shares which it is expected will shortly be forth coming now that there is every prospect of the founderies being brought into full operation  According to the report of the Massachusetts Railroad Com mission there are twelve times as many persons killed and injured at level crossings in that State as in the whole of Germany though there are nearly twice as many of these crossings in the latter country  The Engzneering and Mining yournal is authority for the statement that at Aitken Minn on April 2 at 445 oclock it be came so dark that lights were necessary in businesshouses and the air was filled with snow that is represented to have been as black and dirty as though it had been trampled into the earth Six ounces of snow and onefourth ounce of dirt and sand were found in the bottom of a dish The dirt is very fine something like emery and contains particles that have a metallic lustre This dirty snow fell to the depth of half an inch The atmosphere at the time presented a peculiar greenish tinge There was a little wind blowing at the time from the northwest though there seemed to be a considerable wind higher in the air Solid chunks of ice and sand are reported to have been picked up in various places A series of articles on submarine boats is now appearing in Engineering Among the earlier forms mentioned is one in vented during the American war of independence by David Bush nell of Connecticut for employment against the British ships of war It was like a walnut somewhat flattened and was sunk and raised by letting in and forcing out water One oar served for sculling ahead or astern and another on the screw principle placed above the operator regulated the descent and ascent When on the surface an automatic tube supplied the air necessary for one person for half an hours submersion and another expelled it when foul The manhole was covered with a hinged hatlike covering provided with glazed eyelets and a manometer and com pass were illuminated by phosphorus The torpedo containing I50 pounds of powder clockwork and firing spring was secured on the top of the boat A wooden screw manipulated ingeniously through a tube from the interior was meant to be screwed into the bottom of a hostile ship A line connected this screw with the torpedo whichwhen released floated up by its own buoyancy against the ships bottom The boat was then to beat a rapid retreat and rise again to the surface when at a safe distance The clock work when the time for which it was set had run out unlocked the striker causing the explosion The whole arrangements were well conceived and as Washington said an effort of genius but requiring too many things in combination for much result to be anticipated from them when employed against a watchful enemy The boat manned by Sergeant Lee who had been previously well drilled in its use sallied out against Lord Howes flagship lying off Governors Island near New York and succeeded so far as to get under her without being detected The screw however would not act and the sergeant losing his head and his bearings the attempt signally failed as did two subsequent ones Some time afterwards the vessel conveying the boat up the Hudson River was chased and sunk by a British manofwar and thus closed the brief career of the first divingboat designed and used for ag gressive belligerent purposes The Nationalist a monthly magazine soon to be issued by The Nationalist Club of Boston Mass will have as contributors Col T W Higginson Edward E Hale Rev W D P Bliss Cyrus Field Willard Edward Bellamy Rabbi Solomon Schindler Sylvester Baxter John Ransom Bridge Laurence Gronlund Rev Albert Lawson Gen A F Devereux Henry Willard Austin Mrs Mary Livermore Mrs Maud Howe Elliott Mrs Abby Morton Diaz Miss Frances E Willard Miss A A Chevaillier and many others The declaration of principles of the Nationalist Club readsSCIENCE as follows The principle of the brotherhood of humanity is one of the eternal truths that govern the worlds progress on lines which distinguish human nature from brute nature The principle of competition is simply the application of the brutal law of the sur vival of the strongest and most cunning Therefore so long as competition continues to be the ruling factor in our industrial sys tem the highest development of the individual cannot be reached the loftiest aims of humanity cannot be realized No truth can avail unless practically applied Therefore those who seek the welfare of man must endeavor to suppress the system founded on the brute principle of competition and put in its place another based on the nobler principle of association But in striving to apply this nobler and wiser principle to the complex conditions of modern life we advocate no sudden or illconsidered changes we make no war upon individuals we do not censure those who have accumulated immense fortunes simply by carrying to a logical end the false principle on which business is now based The combi nations trusts and syndicates of which the people at present com plain demonstrate the practicability of our basic principle of asso ciation We merely seek to push this principle a little further and have all industries operated in the interest of all by the nation  the people organized  the organic unity of the whole people The present industrial system proves itself wrong by the immense wrongs it produces it proves itself absurd by the immense waste of energy and material which is admitted to be its concomitant Against this system we raise our protest for the abolition of the slavery it has wrought and would perpetuate we pledge our best efforts Two daring Englishmen Mr E W Everest and Count de Sainville have started from Winnipeg on an adventurous trip They propose to descend the Mackenzie which is nowadays easily accomplished by means of the steamer that was put on the

and Point Barrow It is expected that the expedition will occupy two years  Mr George F Kunz sails on April 20 per steamer La Champagne to represent Messrs Tiffany  Co at the Paris Ex position and also to be acting special agent for the United States Exposition Committee having in charge the government mineralogi cal and metallurgical exhibit At the instance of Mr Jules Simon president of the commis sion of the history of inventions at the great International Exhibi tion at Paris it has been decided that an important part of this branch of the exhibition shall be tableaus showing the characteris tic industries of each of the great epochs of the history of man kind This plan has been taken up vigorously and a number of tableaus have been completed For illustrating the industries of primitive man four groups in full size have been made  the first makers of stone implements the first engravers the first architects and the first founder The first group represents a man and a woman They flake the flints in the same way as the Australians continue to do up to this day the physical and ethnological char acter of whom is moreover so much like that of the earliest inhabi tants of central and western Europe This scene has been modelled according to a sketch by Baines The first engravers are troglo dytes of the reindeer age One of them graves relief figures on a perforated stick of the class generally called chiefs batons The other cuts small sticks which are to become needles The group  Founding of Bronze  shows a founder casting the metal in the mould while another man blows up the fire by means of the double bellows which have been used since the earliest times in eastern Asia All these figures  and this is the most noteworthy part of the work  have been modelled according to skulls and skeletons of the various races those of Canstadt Cro Magnon Furforz etc Dr Hamy undertook the reconstruction of the human races of these ages and it was found that the resulting types are pretty much of the same time as many modern Europeans The collec tion furthermore embraces Egyptian Chaldaean Greek and Gallo Roman figures Egypt is represented by a weaver reproduced 30I from a grave at Thebes As a representative of Chaldtea Gudea has been chosen offering to his god a model of the temple of Tello Four Greeks are shown engaged in making painted vases Ancient France is represented by a factory of clay statuettes The arts and industries of primitive people will be represented by a negro forger and a Samojede engraver those of eastern Asia by a Chinese potter while a manufacturer of paper will represent the industries of ancient America This collection of groups of work ingmen will be supplemented by collections of their manufactures At a recent meeting of the Swedish Anthropological Society Professor G Storm read a paper on his researches relating to the Lapps The speaker held says Nalure that this race had settled in northern Scandinavia as far back as the stone age and had not begun to move southwards until the middle ages These south ward movements had occurred periodically At the end of the fifteenth century the Lapps had reached the sixtyfourth degree of latitude but were now found much farther south The subject was of interest because of the general belief that the Scandinavians had driven the Lapps northwards In common with others Pro fessor Storm was of the opinion that the Lapps belonged to the FinnishUgrian race  The second season of the Marine Biological Laboratory of which Dr C 0 Whitman is director will open soon In the in

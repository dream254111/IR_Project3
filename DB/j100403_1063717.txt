defendant A joint judgment is a bar to a several action and a several judgment to a joint action There is but one right which may be enforced in either of the two ways but not both9 A joint and several con tract however gives rise to two distinct rights of action there being two separate obligations one of the parties jointly and an other of the parties as individuals A stock illustration of this is where one of several partners becomes surety on a partnership note He thereby incurs a joint liability as a member of the part nership and a separate liability by reason of his individual under taking of suretyship10 In such case since there are two distinct rights both may be enforced and it follows as a matter of course that both may be provedone against the partnership estate and the other against the individual estate of the surety While it is true that upon a joint judgment against several persons for a tort execution may be issued against and satisfaction had from any one all or any intermediate number il1 yet this does not give separate rights it is merely a matter of remedy In this respect it is not unlike a judgment obtained on an ordinary contract claim against a partnership which is in its nature always joint12 It is for the dealing with just such claims that the rule of marshalling giving priority to individual creditors over partnership creditors in the distribution of separate assets was established It is believed that the doctrine enunciated by the decision of Re Peck supra is not consistent with the best reasoning and there fore should not establish an exception to the general rule of mar shalling separate assets in such cases but that the opinion in Rey nolds v Newv York Trust Co supra correctly states the law Upon first sight it may seem possible to reconcile these two cases the former involving a tort action for conversion while in the lat ter the tort is waived and action brought in assumpsit on quasi contract It will readily be seen however that this distinction could not affect the conclusion The decision of the point which undoubtedly is the same in both cases rests upon a question of legal rights13 and such rights should not be affected by the nature of the remedy PAROL CONTEMPORANEOUS WAIVER IN INSURANCEPerhaps no branch of law presents more hopeless confusion and conflict  Atlantic  Pacific R v Laird 164 U S

policy making such policy void in its inception by reason of circumstances existing at the time the policy was issued if the existence of such facts was known to the agent at the time or is the insurer by reason of this knowl edge on the part of its agent deemed to have waived this condition or is it estopped from setting up its breach  The majority holding of the state couris is that where an in surance company at the time of the delivery of the policy has knowledge of the breach of a condition the performance of which by the terms of the policy is a condition precedent to the assump tion of any risk it may not set up that breach as a defense to an action on the policy The courts place this holding on the grounds of waiver and estoppel1 and have failed to distinguish clearly be tween the two Though the results of these decisions are very uni form there appears to be no hope of reconciling their varied rea soning or of extracting any uniform ground upon which they are based Some courts have held that the insurance company cannot set up this breach on the theory that the agent on behalf of the company has waived such condition2 others have placed it upon the ground that the knowledge of such facts on the part of the agent is imputed to the company and it is thereby estopped to set up such facts in order to avoid the policy  while others have based their decisions on the ground that to permit the company to receive the premium knowing that the policy does not protect the holder would be a fraud upon him which the courts cannot sanction4 But can this knowledge on the part of the agent be shownl by pa rol evidence so as to show waiver or estoppel Is this not a viola tion of the parol evidence rule In the great majority of cases in which the doctrine of waiver and estoppel has been applied the parol evidence rule was not considered But this question was con sidered in the early case of Dewees v ManhJattan Ins Co5 where it was decided that to admit parol evidence of such knowledge on the part of the agent would be a violation of the parol evidence rule This doctrine has been upheld by the federal courts the leading case in those courts being Northern

of Oklahoma7 Massachusetts 8 and New Jersey 9 also adhere to the federal doctrine Most of the state courts which have faced this question have held that parol evidence is not admitted to contradict or vary the terms of a written instrument but to show that it was procured under such circumstances as to estop the company from relying on its contents not that such testimony may be admitted to contradict or vary the terms of a valid written instrument but to show that the conditions should not be used against the insured on the ground of equitable estoppel1 However as was argued by the court in the Grand View Case the ultimate result of such a rule is to give a different effect to the written terms from that which they intrins ically possess and this result is induced by the admission of oral evidence The extrinsic evidence would fail in its object unless its purpose were to show that the contract written in the policy is not the contract which in reality was made It is a well settled rule that all prior or contemporaneous parol negotiations and agree ments are merged in the written contract and are not to be changed or modified by parol evidence in relation thereto A policy of in surance is a contract in writing such as would bring it under this parol evidence rule Hence the mode of construction adopted by some of the courts by means of which an estoppel can be shown without violating the parol evidence rule seems technically unsound in the light of the argument of the Grand View Case Though technically the federal view seems to be correct the state view is eminently fair and just and better adapted to work substantial justice The parol evidence rule was adopted in order to prevent fraud but in insurance cases of this type the reason for the rule fails It would seem the better policy in allowing parol waivers to frankly admit that in doing so the parol evidence rule is violated and that an exception is established in favor of holders of  183 U S 308 22 Sup Ct 133 46 L Ed 213 The policy contained a provision that it would become void if there were any other insurance on the property unless written in the policy At the time of the is suance of the policy there was in fact other insurance on the property and this fact was known to the insurers agent Held parol evidence to show this knowledge on the part of the agent is inadmissible  Deming

Co v Shader supra It was said in this case by Pound C There is no attempt to show by parol something which is fore closed by the written agreement of the parties The attempt is to show by parol that the company knew of the facts and circumstances which entitled it to enforce the provisions of the policy as to forfeiture or not at its option and that the company itself not any particular agent continued to treat the policy as in force and declined to exercise such option For these reasons we think the former adjudications of this court should be adhered to and in consequence that the testmony ob jected to in the case at bar was admissible 319320 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW insurance policies and there is undoubtedly such a growing tend ency among the courts1 The recent case of Marx v Williamsburgh City Fire Ins Co Mich 158 N W 1052 demonstrates the firmness with which the state court doctrine is established The court without hesitation held that the issuance of the policy by an agent cognizant of such facts as invalidated the instrument in its inception constitutes a waiver of the condition in the policy In strictness the facts point to an estoppel rather than waiver but the significant feature of the opinion is the failure of the court to consider the effect of the paro evidence rule on the testimony introduced by the plaintiff to show the waiver The alacrity with which the court found for the plaintiff would seem to indicate that the exception to this im portant rule is recognized beyond further cavil except in the few jurisdictions where it has been repudiated n

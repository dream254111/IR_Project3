Transactions,i206972,XVII Note respecting the demonstration of the binomial theorem inserted in the last volume of the Philosophical Transactions By Thomas Knight Esq Communicated by Taylor Combe Esq Sec R S Read April 17 1817 I N looking into Mr SPENCES ingenious ct Essay on Loga rithmic Transcendents a work published in 809 but which I have been so unfortunate as never to have seen till within the last fortnight I was not a little surprised to find that a demonstration of the binomial theorem similar to the oneI had the honour to present to the Royal Society had been already given by that writer The same may be said of the first proposition of the preceding Paper on the construction of Logarithms  Having made this acknowledgment I shall perhaps be pardoned for observing that Mr SPENCE is not particularly happy in the manner of developing the kind of functions he treats of in his preface I shalt endeavour to give the solu tion of a class of equations of which he Pref p vii has considered a particular case with this we will begin It is proposed to develope the function which has this pro perty viz  qiy1Yc1X1y  Assume p 1xAAxAxA vtA   and after making the requisite substitutions in the given246 Mr KNIGHTS note respecting the demonstration  equation we see immediately that Ao and that A and A are arbitrary Then to find the law of the coefficients in this and other similar cases where there are any number of independent quantities xi x   x no transpose all the equation to one side and find the coefficient of the first power of x  then the coefficient of the first power of x enX in the former coefficient then again in this last the coefficient of the first power of X n2 and having arrived in this manner at the coefficient of art it will have the form abx cx2   rx 4 and the equation ro will give the law sought for In the present case putting p  x   1  x z r  o  x  I xz we find by equalling to o the coefficient of the first power of y 0A2A 1 sA 1

equation expressing the property of the function that L 1x is a particular value of p ix The same also appears from equation i i which if we putA ntz  A ni i A A X the left hand member vanishes Make

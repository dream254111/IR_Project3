is not so great and the case will be rare where the re quirement of security from the prevailing party will prevent his obtain ing the infant The general disregard of any distinction such as that suggested above16 has resulted in a denial of review of any order in habeas corpus proceedings ELECTION OF REMEDIES BY SELLER IN CONDITIONAL SALE Like other contracts a contract for a conditional sale depends for its interpretation on the reasonable intent of the parties The intent of the parties to such a contract seems most completely analogous to the intent of the parties in a mortgage contractl The buyer as the mortgagor is to have the complete beneficial use of the property includ ing even the right to transfer possession and enjoyment of it by sale or mortgage 2 while the seller as the mortgagee is to retain the legal title merely as security to insure the payment of the purchase price The failure to follow this analogy however has led in most jurisdictions to the doctrine that in case of default by the buyer the seller has the choice of two inconsistent alternative remedies and by certain acts which manifest his intention to rely on one remedy he is considered as waiving his right to the other For example suing for the price is usually held such an election as to vest title in the buyer and to preclude the seller from reclaiming the property3 On the other hand reclaiming theproperty usually precludes him from suing for the price4 The ordinary doctrine of election of remedies is applied But it is submitted that what is con tracted for is not inconsistent alternative remedies but concurrent remedies the very purpose of one of which is to insure the enforcement and satisfaction of the other5 Furthermore to say that by election on the part of the seller title is passed to the buyer seems contrary 6 to the ordinary rules for transfer of title which require mutual assent by the buyer and seller to some specified act of appropriation The only act of appropriation agreed upon in such a contract is the discharge of 15 See Queen v Barnardo supra 214 16 See Yates v People supra 432 But see Cox v Hakes supra 535 1 Chicago Ry Equipment Co v Merchants

mortgagee may sue for the price and also foreclose his mortgage upon the property so the seller in a conditional sale should be allowed to sue for the price and also reclaim the property not as his own but for the purpose of foreclosing it    WILLISTON SALES  571 n 39 See also Judge Sanborns opinion in Manson v Dayton I53 Fed 258 272 6 Bierce Ltd v Hutchins 205 U S 340 346 27 Sup Ct 524 525 462the debt by the buyer Those decisions therefore which do not so readily construe various acts of the seller as a binding election are preferable7 But even where a doctrine of election obtains the result reached in a recent case seems extreme and unwarranted Winton Motor Carriage Co v Broadway Automobile Co II8 Pac 817 Wash The court holds that the mere transfer as security for a loan of the note given for the price in a contract for a conditional sale is such an election by the seller as to pass title immediately to the buyer This decision seems to be contrary to wellsettled principles of law in regard to the assign ment of secured debts as well as to the intent of the parties in the par ticular case The law is well settled that the assignment of a debt carries with it a right to the security8 In like manner the assignment of the sellers claim for the purchase price in a conditional sale whether as a chose in action 9 or in the form of a promissory note 10 carries with it the right to the sellers interest in the property The reasonable intent of the parties in this particular case moreover would seem to be that since the bank as assignee was taking the note as security for a loan it was to have all the security possible connected with the note The true consequence of the transfer of the note therefore it is submitted was the vesting in the assignee of the right to the property as security 1 rather than an abnormal springing of the title to the buyer CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE AS DEFENSE TO ACTIONS BASED ON STATUTES  The general rule is that where a legal duty is imposed by statute an action may be maintained for an injury caused by a breach of such duty by any individual for whose benefit the statute was en acted This right of action exists even if the statute does not provide 7 Suing for the price is not a binding election Forbes Piano Co v Wilson 144 Ala 586 39 So 645 Campbell Printing Press  Mfg Co v Rockaway Pub Co 56 N J L 676 29 Atl 68i Nor is

237 6 S W 565 The fact that the conditions of the sale did not appear on the face of the note is no reason for an exception since the security usually passes with the note even if the assignee did not know of its existence See JONES MORTGAGES 6 ed  8I7 11 It would probably be held in most jurisdictions that the assignee acquired not the legal title but an equitable right to the security and that the assignor held the legal title in trust for the assignee McPherson v Acme Lumber Co 70 Miss 649 12 So 857 1 Ives v Welden II4 Ia 476 87 N W 408 Couch v Steel 3 E  B 402 See COM DIG TIT ACTION UPON

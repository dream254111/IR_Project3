PHAENOMENON AND IN GENERAL,I206866,A RELATION CONCERNING THE LATE EARTHQUAKE NEER OXFORD TOGETHER WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS OF THE SEALED WEATHERGLASS AND THE BARO METERBOTH UPON THAT PHAENOMENONAND IN GENERAL THIS RELATION WAS COMMUNICATED BY THE EXCELLENTLY LEARNED DR WALLIS AS FOLLOWS ON THE 19 OF JANUARY 1665 STYLO ANGLIAE OR JAN 29 1666 STYLO NOVO AT DIVERS PLACES NEER OXFORD WAS OBSERVED A SMALL EARTHQUAKE AS AT BLECHINGTON STANTONST JOHNS BRILC TO WARDS EVENING IN OXFORD IT SELF I DOE NOT HEAR THAT IT WAS OBSERVED TO BE AN EARTHQUAKE YET I REMEMBER ABOUT THAT TIME WHETHER PRECISELY THEN OR NOT I CANNOT SAY I TOOK NOTICE OF SOME KIND OF ODDE SHAKING OR HEAVING I OBSERVED IN MY STUDY BUT DID IMPUTE IT TO THE GOING OF CARTS OR COACHES SUPPOSED TO BE NOT FAR OFF THOUGH YET I DID TAKE NOTICE OF IT AS A LITTLE DIFFERING FROM WHAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND WONDERED THE MORE THAT I DID NOT HEAR ANY BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO REFER IT TO I THOUGHT NO MORE OF IT AND THE LIKE ACCOUNT I HAVE HAD FROM SOME OTHERS IN OXFORD WHO YET DID NOT THINK OF AN EARTH QUAKE IT BEING A RARE THING WITH US HEARING AFTER WARDS OF AN EARTHQUAKE OBSERVED BY OTHERS I LOOKED ON MY NOTES CONCERNING MY THERMOSCOPE AND BAROSCOPETO SEE IF ANY AL TERATION CONSIDERABLE HAD THEN HAPPENED MY THERMOSCOPE CONSISTS OF A ROUND LARGE GLASS CONTAINING ABOUT HALF A PINT OR MORE FROM WHENCE ISSUES A LONG CYLIN DRICAL NECK OF GLASS ABOUT TWO FOOT AND A HALF IN LENGTH AND LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH DIAMETER WHICH NECK WAS HER METICALLY SEALED AT THE TOP TO EXCLUDE COMMUNICATION WITH THE EXTERNAL AIR BUT BEFORE THE SEALING OF IT THE WHOLE GLASS WAS FILLED WITH SPIRIT OF WINE TINGED WITH COCHINEEL TO MAKE IT THE MORE DISCERNABLE TO THE EYESO WARMEDTHAT IT FILLED THE WHOLE CONTENT OF THE GLASS BUT AFTERWARDS AS IT COOLED DID SO SUBSIDE AS TO LEAVE A VOID SPACE IN THE UPPER PART OF THE NECK WHICH INSTRUMENT SO PREPARED DOTH BY THE RISING OR FALLING OF THE TIN GED LIQUOR IN THE NECKCONFEQUENT UPON THE EXPANDING OR CON TRACTING OF THE WHOLE LIQUOR CONTAINED IN IT AND THE BALL BE LOWGIVE A VERY NICE ACCOUNT OF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR AS167 AS TO HEAT OR COLD EVEN SO NICE AS THAT MY BEING OR NOT BEING IN MY STUDY I FIND TO VARY ITS HIGHT SOMETIMES ALMOST A QUARTER OF AN INCH MY BAROSCOPE I CALL ANOTHER INSTRUMENT FOR ESTIMATING THE WEIGHT OR PRESSURE OF THE INCUMBENT AIR CONSISTING OF A LONG GLASSTUBE OF ABOUT 4 FOOT IN LENGTH AND ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH BORE WHICH TUBE HERMETICALLY FEALED AT THE ONE END BEING FILLED WITH QUICKSILVER ACCORDING TO THE TORRICELLIAN EXPERI MENT IS INVERTED SO AS TO HAVE THE OPEN END OF IT IMMERSED IN STAGNANT QUICKSILVER CONTAINED IN A LARGER GLASS UNDER IT EX POSED TO THE PRESSURE OF THE OUTWARD AIR OUT OF WHICH OPEN END AFTER SUCH IMMERSION THE QUICKSILVER IN THE TUBE BEING SUFFERED TO RUN OUT AS MUCH AS IT WILL INTO THE STAGNANT QUICK SILVER IN WHICH THAT MOUTH OR OPEN END IS IMMERSED THERE IS WONT TO REMAIN AS IS COMMONLY KNOWN TO THOSE ACQUAINTED WITH THIS EXPERIMENT A CYLINDER OF QUICKSILVER SUSPENDED IN THE TUBE ABOUT 28 29 OR 30 INCHES HIGH MEASURING FROM THE SURFACE OF THE STAGNANT QUICKSILVER PERPENDICULARLY BUT MORE OR LESS WITHIN SUCH LIMITS ACCORDING AS THE WEIGHT OR PRESSURE OF THE AIR INCUMBENT ON THE EXTERNAL STAGNANT QUICKSILVER EXPOSED TO IT IS GREATER OR LESS LEAVING THE UP PER PART OF THE TUBE VOID BOTH WHICH INSTRUMENTS BEING THE CONTRIVANCE OF THE HONOURABLE ROBERT BOYLE THEY ARE BY HIM MORE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED IN HIS PHYSICOMECHANICAL EXPE RIMENTS TOUCHING THE AIR EXPER 17 AND 18 AND IN HIS THERMOME TRICAL DISCOURSES PREMISED TO HIS HISTORY OF COLD NOW ACCORDING TO BOTH THESE INSTRUMENTS HAVING KEPT A DAILY REGISTER OF OBSERVATIONS FOR MORE THAN A WHOLE YEAR SA VING WHEN I HAVE BEEN FOR SOME SHORT TIME ABSENT FROM HOME I FIND MY NOTES FOR THAT DAY TO BE THESE JANUARY THERMOSCOPE BAROSCOPE 16656 DAY HOUR INCHES INCHES 19 8 MORN 14 116 29 12 HARD FROST CLOSE 4 EVEN 14 38 29 14 HARD FROST CLOUDY 9 EVEN 14 34 29 34 RAIN WIND 20 8 MORN 15 14 28 34 SUNSHINE WIND SO THAT THERE BEING IN THE MORNING JANUARY 19 A HARD FROST WHICH BEGAN THE DAY BEFORE ABOUT 4 OF THE CLOCK IN THE AFTER NOON168 NOONJAN18AND CONTINUEDWITH USTILL ABOUT 5 OF THE CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON OF THAT DAY JAN 19 WITH SOME FIERCENESS AND THE WEATHER JAN 19 BEING IN THE MORNINGCLOSE AND CLOUDY ALL THE DAY WITH LITTLE OF SUNSHINE THE LIQUOR IN THE THERMOSCOPE WAS VERY LITTLE RAISED BY 4 OF THE CLOCK AFTERNOON THAT IS BUT 416 OF AN INCH WHICH HAD THE SUN SHONE WOULD ITS LIKELY HAVE BEEN NEAR AN INCH AND AFTER THAT TIMEOR SOMEWHAT BEFORE HAD THERE BEEN NO CONSIDERABLE CHANGE OF WEATHER IT WOULD UPON THE SUNS SETTING HAVE FALLEN AND PROBABLY SO IT DID TILL A BOUT 5 OF THE CLOCK THOUGH I TOOK NO OBSERVATION IN THE IN TERIM BUT CONTRARY TO WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IT WAS AT 9 OF THE CLOCK AT NIGHT HIGHER BY 38 OF AN INCH THAN IT HAD BEEN AT 4 OCCASIONED BY THE CHANGE OF WEATHER THE FROST SUDDENLY BREAKING WITH US BETWEEN 5 AND 6 OF THE CLOCK A BOUT WHICH TIME ALSO IT BEGAN TO RAIN AND CONTINUED RAINING THAT EVENING AND GOOD PART OF THE NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORN ING I FOUND THE LIQUOR YET HIGHER BY HALF AN INCH VID 1514 IN CHES BY REASON OF THE AIR THAT NIGHT BEING SO MUCH WARMER THAN IT HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE WHEREAS COMMONLY IT IS CON SIDERABLY LOWER IN THE MORNING THAN OVER NIGHT AS TO THE BAROSCOPE FOR THE WEIGHT OR PRESSURE OF THE AIR I FIND THAT FOR THE 11 12 13 14 15 16 AND 17 DAYES THE MER CURY IN THE TUBE WAS BY THE BALLANEING PRESSURE OF THE INCUM BENT AIR ON THE STAGNANT QUICKSILVER EXPOSED TO IT KEPT UP TO THE HEIGHT OF NEAR 30 INCHES ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE EXTERNAL QUICKSILVER THOUGH WITH SOME LITTLE VARIATION AS 30 291516 2928 291316 BUT NEVER SO LOW ALL THAT TIME AS 2934 WHICH IS THE GREAT EST HEIGHT I HAVE KNOW IT AT FOR I DO NOT FIND THAT I HAVE EVER TILL THEN OBSERVED IT TO BE IN MY GLASSES FULL 30 INCHES THOUGH IT HAVE BEEN VERY NEAR IT THE WEATHER HAVING BEEN ALMOST CONTINUALLY FOGGY OR VERY THICK MISTS ALL THAT TIME JANUARY 18 IT CAME DOWN TO 2934 IN THE FORENOON AND AFTERNOON TO 291116 ABOUT THE TIME THE FROST BEGAN AND JAN 19 IT WAS AT 8 IN THE MORNING COME DOWN TO 2912 AT 4 IN THE AFTERNOON TO 2914 BUT AT 9 IN THE EVENINGWHEN THE EARTH QUAKE HAD INTERVENED IT WAS RISEN HALF AN INCH VID TO 29 34 AND BY THE NEXT MORNING FALLEN AGAIN A WHOLE INCH VID TO 28 34 WHICH FALL I ATTRIBUTE AT LEAST IN PART TO THE RAIN THAT FELL IN THE NIGHT THIS BEING WHAT I OBSERVED OUT OF MY REGISTER OF THESE IN STRUMENTS WHICH IF I HAD THEN THOUGHT OF AN EARTHQUAKE I SHOULD169 SHOULD HAVE MORE NICELY WATCHED WHAT I HAVE FURTHER GATHER ED FROM REPORTS IS TO THIS PURPOSE I HEAR IT WAS OBSERVED AT BLECHINGTON ABOVE 5 MILES TO THE NORTH OF OXFORDAND SO ALONG BY BOSTOL HORTON STANTONST JOHNS AND SO TOWARDS WHATELY WHICH IS ABOUT 4 MILES EASTWARD FROM OXFORD NOT AT ALL THESE PLACES AT THE SAME TIME BUT MOVING FOR WARD FROM BLECHINGTON TOWARDS WHATELY FOR IT WAS AT STANTON ABOUT 6 OF THE CLOCK OR LATER AS I UNDERSTAND FROM MR BOYLE WHO WAS THERE AT THAT TIME BUT HAD BEEN AT BLECHINGTON A GOOD WHILE SOONER AND I AM TOLD THAT IT WAS TAKEN NOTICE OF BY DOCTOR HOLDER A MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY WHO WAS THEN AT BLECHINGTON TO BE OBSERVED BY THOSE IN THE FURTHER PART OF THE GARDEN SOME VERY DISCERNABLE TIME BEFORE IT WAS OBSERVED BY THOSE IN THE HOUSE CREEPING FORWARD FROM THE ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER WHAT OTHER PLACES IN THE COUNTRY IT WAS OBSERVED AT I HAVE NOT BEEN INFORMED BUT AT OXFORD WHICH IT SEEMS WAS ABOUT THE SKIRTS OF IT IT WAS SO SMALL AS WOULD HAVE BEEN HARDLY NOTED AT ALLHAD NOT THE NOTICETAKEN OF IT ABROADINFOR MED US OF IT UPON THIS OCCASIONIT WILL NOT BE UNSEASONABLE TO GIVE SOME GENERAL ACCOUNTS OF WHAT I HAVE IN MY THERMOSCOPE AND BARO SCOPE OBSERVED MY THERMOSCOPE BEING FITTED SOMEWHAT AT ADVENTURES I HAVE FOUND AT THE LOWEST TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE THAN 12 INCHES HIGH IN THE FICRCEST TIME OF THE LONG FROST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST YEAR 1665 AND ABOUT 27 INCHES HIGH AT THE HIGHEST IN THE HOTTEST TIME OF THE LAST SUMMER WHICH I MENTIONTHAT IT MAY APPEAR AT WHAT TEMPERATURE IN PROPORTION THE AIR WAS AT THE TIME ABOVEMENTIONED BUT I MUST ADD WITHALL THAT THIS STAND ING SOAS NEVER TO BE EXPOSED TO THE SUNBUT IN A ROOM THAT HAS A WINDOW ONLY TO THE NORTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RAISED MUCH HIGHER THAN 27 INCHES IF IT WERE PUT IN THE HOT SUNSHINE IN SUMMER THISAS IT IS PLACEDGIVING THEREFORE AN ACCOUNT ONELY OF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR IN GENERAL NOT OF THE IMMEDIATE HEAT OF THE SUNSHINE THIS INSTRUMENTTHUS SITUATED WHEN IT IS ABOUT 15 INCHES OR LOWERIS FOR THE MOST PART HARD FROST BUT SELDOM A FROST IF HIGH ER THAN 16 YET THIS I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT THE AIR BY THE THERMOSCOPE HAS APPEARED CONSIDERABLY COLDER AND THE LIQUOR LOWER AT SOMETIMES WHEN THERE IS NO FROST THAN AT SOME OTHER TIMES WHEN THE FROST HATH BEEN CONSIDERABLY HARD IN170 IN MY BAROSCOPE I HAVE NEVER FOUND THE QUICKSILVER HIGHER THAN 30 INCHESNOR LOWER THAN 28 AT LEAST SCARCE DISCERNABLY NOT 116 OF AN INCH HIGHER THAN THAT OR LOWER THAN THIS WHICH I MENTIONNOT ONLY TO SHEW THE LIMITS WITHIN WHICH I HAVE OBSER VED MINE TO KEEP VID FULL 2 INCHES BUT LIKEWISE AS AN ESTIMATE OF THE CLEARNESS OF THE QUICKSILVER FROM AIR FOR THOUGH MY QUICKSILVER WERE WITH GOOD CARE CLEANSED FROM THE AIR YET I FIND THAT WHICH MR BOYLE USETH MUCH BETTER FOR COMPARING HIS WITH MINE AT THE SAME TIMES AND BOTH IN OXFORD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE I FIND HIS QUICKSILVER TO STAND ALWAIES SOMEWHAT HIGH ER THAN MINE SOMETIMES NEER A QUARTER OF AN INCH WHICH I KNOW NOW HOW TO GIVE A MORE PROBABLE ACCOUNT OFF THAN THAT MY QUICKSILVER IS EITHER HEAVIER THAN HIS OR ELSE THAT HIS IS BETTER CLEANSED FROM AIR UNLESS POSSIBLY THE DIFFERENCE OF THE BORE OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TUBE MAY CAUSE THE ALTERATION MINE BEING A TALLER TUBE AND A BIGGER BORE THAN HIS AND UPON LIKE REASON AS HIS STANDS HIGHER THAN MINE SO ANO THER LESS CLEANSED FROM AIR MAY AT THE SAME TIME BE CONSIDERA BLY LOWER AND CONSEQUENTLY UNDER 28 INCHES AT THE LOWEST IN THICK FOGGY WEATHER I FIND MY QUICKSILVER TO RISE WHICH I ADSCRIBE TO THE HEAVINESS OF THE VAPOURS IN THE AIR AND I HAVE NEVER FOUND IT HIGHER THAN IN THE FOGGY WEATHER ABOVE MENTIONED IN SUNSHINY WEATHERIT RISETH ALSO AND COMMONLY THE CLEARER THE MORE WHICH I THINK MAY BE IMPUTED PARTLY TO THE VA PORS RAISED BY THE SUNAND MAKING THE AIR HEAVIER AND PARTLY TO THE HEAT INCREASING THE ELASTICK OR SPRINGY POWER OF THE AIR WHICH LATTER I THE RATHER ADD BECAUSE I HAVE SOMETIMES OB SERVED IN SUNSHINY WEATHER WHEN THERE HAVE COME CLOUDS FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME SUPPOSE AN HOUR OR TWO THE QUICK SILVER HAS FALLEN AND THEN UPON THE SUNS BREAKING OUT AGAIN IT HAS RISEN AS BEFORE IN RAINY WEATHER IT USETH TO FALL OF WHICH THE REASON IS OBVI OUSBECAUSE THE AIR IS LIGHTNED BY SO MUCH AS FALLS IN SNOWY WEATHER LIKE WISEBUT NOT SO MUCH AS IN RAIN AND SOMETIMES I HAVE OBSERVED IT UPON A HOARFROST FALLING IN THE NIGHT FOR WINDY WEATHER I FIND IT GENERALLY TO FALL AND THAT MORE UNIVERSALLY AND MORE DISCERNABLY THAN UPON RAIN WHICH I ATTRIBUTE TO THE WINDS MOVING THE AIR COLLATERALLY AND THEREBY NOT SUFFERING IT TO PRESS SO MUCH DIRECTLY DOWNWARDS THE LIKE OF WHICH171 WHICH WE SEE IN SWIMMING C AND I HAVE NEVER FOUND IT LOWER THAN IN HIGH WINDS I HAVE DIVERS TIMES UPON DISCERNING MY QUICKSILVER TO FALL WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE CAUSE AT HOMELOOKED ABROADS AND FOUND BY THE APPEARANCE OF BROKEN CLOUDS OR OTHERWISE THAT IT HAD RAINED NOT FAR OFF THOUGH NOT WITH US WHEREUPONTHE AIR BEING THEN LIGHTENED OUR HEAVIER AIR WHERE IT RAINED NOT MAY HAVEIN PART DISCHARGED IT SELF ON THAT LIGHTER THE AUTHOR OF THESE OBSER VATIONS INTENDS HEREAFTER MORE PARTICULARLY TO OBSERVE FROM WHAT POINTS THOSE WINDS BLOW THAT MAKE THE QUICKSILVER THUS SUBSIDE

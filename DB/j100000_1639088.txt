of Xrays on fertilizin already referred to provides another instance where the effects are with out direct morphological representation Doubtless others occur These cases must of course be accounted for by any explana tion of the effect of radiation on living organisms The facts as they are at present known in regard to the effects of radioactivity on living matter show that life processes are subject to marked changes under the influ ence of the radiation a slight exposure be ing accelerative in most cases while a more intense treatment is inhibitive or destruc tive As a causal factor in these effects the demonstrable injury to the chromatin of the cells is undoubtedly important but there are also good evidences that the modifiabil ity of enzymes under the action of the rays likewise plays a considerable part either directly or indirectly in the resulting in jury A RICHARDS WOODS IIOLE ARE RECESSIVE CHARACTERS DUE TO LOSS SINCE the presenceabsence theory came into vogue it has become quite customary to re gard recessive characters as due to the absence of something in the germ plasm on which the corresponding dominant character depends The nomenclature of the presenceabsence theory has been adopted by most writers on Mendelian inheritance and it has afforded a useful and convenient method of expressing gametic formulas although as Morgan has shown there are cases in which it leads to in consistent results While it is often recog nized that this nomenclature is a purely sym bolic scheme of indicating how certain char acters behave in inheritance the habitual em ployment of the system in the search for form ulas which will designate by a series of large and small letters the gametic constitution of the organisms one is dealing with has a strong tendency to influence ones views in regard to several important problems of heredity and evolution I can not but think that the opin ions of many students of genetics have been unduly influenced by their formulas Form ulas are excellent servants but bad masters Almost involuntarily a certain interpretation is attached to their symbolism which is apt to have the practical effect of actual belief if it does not succeed in producing it Since the establishment of Mendels law and its successful employment in elucidating many previously enigmatical phenomena of inherit ance heritable variations have commonly come to be considered as due to the addition or subtraction of discrete units of germ plasm the bearers of unit characters Professor Bateson in his Problems of Genetics says in regard to substantive variations that we are beginning to know in what such variations consist These changes must occur either by the addition or loss of factors And further on he makes the following sig nificant statement Recognition of the distinction between dominant and recessive characters has it must be conceded created a very serious obstacle in the way of any rational and concrete theory of evolution While variations of all kinds could be regarded as mani festations of some mysterious instability of organ isms this difficulty did not occur to the minds of evolutionists To most of those who have taken part in genetic analysis it has become a permanent and continual obsession With regard to the origin of recessive variations there is as we have seen no special difficulty They are negative and are due to absences but as soon as it is understood that dominants are caused by an addition we are com pletely at a loss to account for their origin for we can not surmise any source from which they have been derived In his more recent address before the Brit ish Association Bateson not only interprets all recessive characters as due to loss but sug gests that dominant characters may have arisen by the removal of inhibiting factors thereby causing a  release  of the characters which previously lay latent in the germ plasm 300 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 3 1915 and producing the appearance but only the appearance of new variations He says In spite of seeming perversity we have to admit that there is no evolutionary change which in the present state of our knowledge we can positively declare to be not due to loss If we explain not only the actual disappear ance of characters as caused by germinal loss but the appearance of new characters as due to the loss of inhibitors which prevented these characters from manifesting themselves it is theoretically possible to consider the whole process of progressive evolution as accom plished by the sloughing off of inhibiting fac tors Such a doctrine which naturally re minds one of the extravagancies of the theory of emboitement might have proved quite ac ceptable to Leibnitz Haller or Bonnet but unless I misunderstand him Professor Bate son has presented this view more as an illus tration of the bankruptcy of present evolu tionary theory than as a matter of serious conviction of his own I will not discuss this interesting speculation further than to observe that any interpretation of variation which logically leads to such a standpoint naturally incurs a very justifiable suspicion of unsound ness It may be that in the case of any par ticular variation we are unable to positively declare that it is not due to loss but on the other hand we are unable to positively declare that most variations are due to loss I think I am not going too far in stating that a ger minal variation due to loss has not been proved to occur in any single case If it is legitimate to explain the appearance of new characters as due to the removal of inhibitors we may also explain the apparent loss of a character as due to the advent of inhibitors It is surely justifiable to assume that inhibi tors can come into an organism somehow if we are permitted to make such frequent use of their disappearance in accounting for the origin of new variations The plain fact is that we know practically nothing of the changes in the germ plasm which we postu late as the causes of variability It is easy to assume the existence of an inhibitor to bring any particular variation into line with ones general theory but such explanations are purely formal and therefore of little scientific value While few would be inclined to follow Bate son in his rather paradoxical interpretation of dominance the doctrine that recessiveness is due to loss is coming to be quite prevalent among workers in genetics One of the chief reasons for regarding so much of the varia tion that has arisen among domestic animals as caused by the loss of factors is the fact that the crossing of different varieties often pro duces a reversion toward the ancestral type If we regard the ancestor of our races of do mestic mice for instance as possessing a full complement of factors and assume that the different varieties have arisen by the dropping out of one or more factors in this variety and one or more other factors in that variety then when these varieties are crossed the hybrid may possess all the factors of the original an cestor and hence show a reversion to type On the basis of this assumption one can make out gametic formulas for the different vari eties of a species test them by breeding ex periments and thus verify their correctness Gametic fomulas obtained in this way doubt less symbolize a truth in regard to the germi nal constitution of the organisms in question The value of such formulas is no longer a matter of doubt and is quite independent of the various interpretations that can be made concerning the nature of the symbolism just as chemical formule are of value quite irre spective of the various theories of the consti tution of atoms Consider the origin of a black mouse ac cording to the presenceabsence hypothesis We may explain the origin of a black mouse by saying that it is caused by the absence of the agouti or ticking factor that breaks up the color of the hair into bars Gray is there fore black plus an agouti factor But does it follow that because we can interpret the facts in this way and interpret them consistently so far as breeding experiments are concerned the change that has taken place in the germ plasm that produced a black mouse was really a loss Such a change is frequently SCIENCE 301302 SCIENCE assumed to be the result of an actual loss of a little discrete unit of some sort in the germ plasm De Vries has interpreted recessiveness as due to the latency or loss of potency of pan gens but we may also assume that the germi nal basis of the character in question has undergone a change of such a character that without becoming inactive it ceases to func tion in its usual way The agouti factor commonly designated by G may be regarded as dependent on a part of the germ plasm a section of a chromosome possibly which when present causes the barring of color in the hair When a black mouse arises we may suppose that something takes place in G It is not necessarily a change in the direction of either chemical or organic simplicity any more than it is necessarily a loss of substance The fact that the modified condition is recessive to G proves nothing whatsoever in regard to the mature of the transformation that has occurred ain the germ plasm Assuming that G is not actually lost but modified into another kind tof substance g the recessiveness of g may be due to the fact that its activity is manifested in a different way relative slowness of its metabolism or to various other conceivable causes There is I believe no good reason for con sidering the recessiveness of a character as due to the relative simplicity of its germinal basis Many variations of a minus character are recessive but there are numerous excep tions to this rule as is illustrated by the domi nance of the hornless condition in cattle the short tail of Manx cats and the lack of beards in certain kinds of wheat Suppose we have two allelomorphic units assuming for the present that there are such things as germinal units A and A one of which tends to pro duce a relatively simple development of a part and the other a relatively complex development of a particular part of the body The one A calls forth say simple horns the other branched horns A and A presumably differ chemically and the development of the part in question depends not upon A or A alone but upon how these agencies affect other parts of the body during development Will the N S VOL XLII No 1079 simpler substance or organic unit call forth the simpler structure in the adult body In asmuch as the development of any organ in volves activities in which a larger number of elements are concerned it seems not at all im probable that the simpler substance or unit might conspire to produce the more complex organ Now suppose that the forked horn proved to be dominant over the simple horn What conclusions would we be entitled to draw from this fact concerning the germinal basis of these characters Obviously none Whether we interpret a variation as a gain or a loss is in most cases a purely arbitrary matter In sugar corn there is a loss of starch but there is a gain of sugar Does sugar corn therefore represent a plus or a minus varia tion Consider the familiar cases of rose comb and pea comb in poultry Both of these variations are dominant over the primitive condition of single comb Yet both breeds carry the basis for the production of single comb in their germ plasm It is commonly assumed that both conditions represent single comb plus something We may suppose that in a certain chromosome a change has taken place which results in the development of rose comb This change for all that we know may be due to the loss or impairment of a portion of germ plasm or it may be due to a change not properly describable as either a gain or loss We may regard rose and pea comb as more or less pathological deviations based on germinal defect as true progressive varia tions or simply as normal variations neither progressive nor retrogressive So far as com plexity of structure is concerned it may be a matter of dispute whether rose comb pea comb or single comb represents the higher grade of development But it may be asked are not color varieties commonly due to loss and is not this obviously the case with albinism In many varieties there has certainly been a loss of pigment but has there been a dropping out of factors It by no means follows The factors represented by small letters in our color formulas are by no means missing entities They are changed so that they occasion a diminished productionSCIENCE of certain pigments but in other respects they may be as potent as before The albino does not produce pigment but there may be other substances in the place of pigment that would distinguish the albino as a positive variation when judged by other standards The animals whose gametic formulas contain a number of small letters are not necessarily more imper fect or perhaps I should say incomplete than their congeners which carry a large number of dominant characters Of course there may be varieties due to losses of germinal material Considering the complex mechanism of mitosis and the op portunities afforded for the loss of chromatin during this process such variations are not improbable a priori But there is not the slightest warrant in the fact of recessiveness per se for the doctrine that all recessive varia tions are produced by this method The origin of socalled unit characters may depend for the most part not upon germinal loss or gain but simply on transformation Viewed in this simple and natural way the appearance of a new dominant character is not an event to be marvelled at Dominant and recessive charac ters not improbably owe their origin to much the same causes At least we do not know that they do not Concerning the real causes of variations of any kind we know very little more than we did when Darwin commented on our profound ignorance of this subject It is therefore premature to pin our faith to any particular theory of the origin of variation and especially to draw farreaching conclusions re garding evolution on the basis of such an in terpretation We may conceive variability as due to germinal losses or gains for the sake of our formulas and there may be little harm in so doing so long as it is clearly realized that the procedure is a purely arbitrary and schematic method of recording certain facts of inheritance But when we make the serious attempt to apply the conception to what actu ally takes place in the germ plasm we en counter a fruitful source of fallacies S  H OLMES UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 303 ERNST GRIMSEHL ON October 30 1914 Ernst Grimsehl fell near Langemarck in the bitter fighting along the Yser line Only two days before he had received the iron cross Although he was in his fiftyfourth year yet he responded volun tarily and full of enthusiasm to the call to the colors as an  Oberleutnant der Landwehr On October 1 he marched with the 213th regi ment across the Belgian frontier For only a few weeks was he permitted to fight for his country which he so dearly loved He died as so many others at his side without living to see the victory which he so confidently hoped for In his death the German educational sys tem loses a personality which was unique in its character and therefore can not be re placed All his thoughts and efforts were di rected to this ideal of placing physics teaching on a firmer basis and of bringing it nearer and nearer to perfection His friend A Keferstein has in the Unterrichtsfiittern sketched the character of his work with beauty and conviction He says in part His preeminent manual dexterity and his thor ough knowledge of the instrumentmakers art which as a student he had gained in his vacation days from the masters of the art qualified him for the creation of cleancut models of apparatus These he tried out at every point till he had cor rected by his masterly hand their first faults and made them respond to his every wish Of his original inventive skill as an experi menter numerous publications bear witness one must have watched him getting ready for an experimental lecture such as he was wont to give almost every year at the spring meet ing of the Association for the Promotion of Instruction in Mathematics and the Natural Sciences in order to gain the secret of this skill He was tireless and enthusiastic in his efforts to perfect his arrangements often by hours of labor in a strange place and in a 1

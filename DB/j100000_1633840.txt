and sub Arctic America They occur generally in basins of limited area in the older rocks Such basins are rather widely distributed in Alaska Brooks2 has recently reviewed the literature relating to those in Alaska A number of isolated Tertiary basins are known in the islands of the Arctic Archipelago8 and others have been reported in the Northwest Territory east of northern Alaska The age of nearly all of the Tertiary beds which are known in Arctic America has been deter mined from plant remains occurring in them so that we have a very fair knowledge of the plant life of northern America in Tertiary times but a very meager knowledge of the invertebrate freshwater fauna which lived in some of the Tertiary lakes of Arctic America The discovery of such a fauna by the writer during the past summer along the Porcupine River in northeastern Alaska seens therefore worthy of record About one hundred miles above its junction with the Yukon the Porcupine River enters the Yukon Flats an alluvial plain without topographic relief through which the Yukon River flows for 200 miles Before entering the Yukon Flats the Porcupine traverses for about 25 miles a belt of limestones of Paleozoic age having a north and south trend and giv ing rise to low mountains and hills Between this belt of elevated country and a similar but wider zone of topographic relief near the in ternational boundary extends a comparatively flat basin having a width of about 25 miles The north and south extent of this basin which Maddren has called the Coleen Basin5 after the river draining its northern portion is unknown There is good reason to believe however that its north and south extent is much greater than its width The Porcupine traverses this basin in wide sweeping mean ders The migration of the channel of the river along parts of its course through this basin has left in places low banks bordered by recent silts An older set of sedi ments however constitutes the bulk of the floor of the Coleen Basin These older sedi ments are well exposed on the largest meander in this portion of the river known as the Fish Hook bend which shows continuous bluffs for two or three miles 40 to 100 feet high composed mainly of finely laminated shale or clay The dominant color of these beds is light lemon yellow which is varied by patches of yellowish green pink and brownish At the upper end of Fish Hook bend on the west bank of the river the fol lowing section was measured Feet 1 Fine sand soil and muck top  1 5 2 Coarse gravel and sand   10 3 Dark carbonaceous clay and old forest bed 0 2 4

another Anadonta athlios Mayer of the same beds but they are probably not identical The beds are probably Oligocene or upper Eocene like those of Kenai Considerable interest attaches to these fossils in connection with their bearing on the distribution in Tertiary times of the Naiades a group repre sented in the present streams and lakes of lower latitudes in North America by several hundred species Maddern and McConnell7 have reported two basins similar to the Coleen but larger higher up the Porcupine a short distance east of the international boundary One of these has an approximate length of 100 miles and a width of 60 miles No fossils were obtained by Mc Connell from these upper basins but the de scription which he gives of the beds exposed corresponds so closely to the sections observed by the writer that it is highly probable that the age of the beds in the basins on the two sides of the boundary is the same McCon nell8 expressed a similar opinion concerning the equivalence of the beds in question but presented no paleontologic evidence of the age of the beds in either of the basins which he described E M KINDLE U S GEOLOGICAL SURVEY WASHINGTON D C February

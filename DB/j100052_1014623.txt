J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014623,CODE OF ETHICS OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATION ADOPTED IN 1852,I242692,CODE OF ETHICS OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATION CODE OF ETHICS OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATION ADOPTED IN 1852 THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIA TION COMPOSED OF PHARMACEUTISTS AND DRUG GISTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES FEELING A STRONG INTEREST IN THE SUCCESS AND ADVANCE MENT OF THEIR PROFESSION IN ITS PRACTICAL AND SCIENTIFIC RELATIONS AND ALSO IMPRESSED WITH THE BELIEF THAT NO AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL WILL PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THE PUBLIC FROM THE ILL EFFECTS OF AN UNDUE COMPETITION AND THE TEMPTATIONS TO GAIN AT THE EXPENSE OF QUALITY UNLESS THEY ARE UPHELD BY HIGH MORAL OBLIGATIONS IN THE PATH OF DUTY HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO THE FOLLOWING CODE OF ETHICS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT ARTICLE 1AS THE PRACTICE OF PHAR MACY CAN ONLY BECOME UNIFORM BY AN OPEN AND CANDID INTERCOURSE BEING KEPT UP BE TWEEN APOTHECARIES AND DRUGGISTS AMONG THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER BY THE ADOPTION OF THE NATIONAL PHARMACOPOEIA AS A GUIDE IN THE PREPARATION OF OFFICIAL MEDICINES AND BY THE DISCONTINUANCE OF SECRET FORMULAE AND THE PRACTICES ARISING FROM A QUACKISH SPIRIT AND BY AN ENCOURAGEMENT OF THAT ESPRIT DE CORPS WHICH WILL PREVENT A RESORT TO THOSE DISREPUTABLE PRACTICES ARISING OUT OF AN INJURIOUS AND WICKED COMPETITION THEREFORE THE MEMBERS OF THIS ASSOCIATION AGREE TO UPHOLD THE USE OF THE PHARMACO POEIA IN THEIR PRACTICE TO CULTIVATE BROTHERLY FEELING AMONG THE MEMBERS AND TO DIS COUNTENANCE QUACKERY AND DISHONORABLE COMPETITION IN THEIR BUSINESS ART 2AS LABOR SHOULD HAVE ITS JUST REWARD AND AS SKILL KNOWLEDGE AND RE SPONSIBILITY REQUIRED IN THE PRACTICE OF PHARMACY ARE GREAT THE REMUNERATION OF THE PHARMACEUTISTS SERVICES SHOULD BE PRO PORTIONED TO THESE RATHER THAN TO THE MAR KET VALUE OF THE PREPARATIONS VENDED THE RATE OF CHARGES WILL NECESSARILY VARY WITH GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION MUNICIPAL LOCATION AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF A PERMANENT CHARACTER BUT A RESORT TO INTENTIONAL AND UNNECESSARY REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF CHARGES AMONG APOTHECARIES WITH A VIEW TO GAINING AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR BRETHERN IS STRONGLY DISCOUNTENANCED BY THIS ASSOCIATION AS PRO DUCTIVE OF EVIL RESULTS ART 3THE FIRST DUTY OF THE APOTHE CARY AFTER DULY PREPARING HIMSELF FOR HIS PROFESSION BEING TO PROCURE GOOD DRUGS AND PREPARATIONS FOR WITHOUT THESE HIS SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE ARE OF SMALL AVAIL HE FREQUENTLY HAS TO RELY ON THE GOOD FAITH OF THE DRUGGIST FOR THEIR SELECTION THOSE DRUGGISTS WHOSE KNOWLEDGE SKILL AND INTEGRITY ENABLE THEM TO CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS FAITHFULLY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED RATHER THAN THOSE WHO BASE THEIR CLAIMS OF PATRONAGE ON THE CHEAPNESS OF THEIR ARTICLES SOLELY WHEN ACCIDENTALLY OR OTHERWISE A DETERIORATED OR ADULTERATED DRUG OR MEDICINE IS SENT TO THE APOTHECARY HE SHOULD INVARIABLY RETURN IT TO THE DRUG GIST WITH A STATEMENT OF ITS DEFECTS WHAT IS TOO FREQUENTLY CONSIDERED A MERE ERROR OF TRADE ON THE PART OF THE DRUGGIST BECOMES A HIGHLY CULPABLE ACT WHEN COUNTENANCED BY THE APOTHECARY HENCE WHEN REPETITIONS OF968 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SUCH FRAUDS OCCUR THEY SHOULD BE EXPOSED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PROFESSION A CAREFUL BUT FIRM PURSUIT OF THIS COURSE WOULD RENDER WELLDISPOSED DRUGGISTS MORE CAREFUL AND DETER THE FRAUDULENTLY INCLINED FROM A RE SORT TO THEIR DISREPUTABLE PRACTICES ART 4AS THE PRACTICE OF PHARMACY IS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND HAS BEEN FOUND TO FLOURISH IN PROPOR TION AS ITS PRACTITIONERS HAVE CONFINED THEIR ATTENTION TO ITS REQUIREMENTS AND AS THE CONDUCTION OF THE BUSINESS OF BOTH PROFES SIONS BY THE SAME INDIVIDUAL INVOLVES PECUNIARY TEMPTATIONS WHICH ARE OFTEN NOT COMPATIBLE WITH A CONSCIENTIOUS DISCHARGE OF DUTY WE CONSIDER THAT THE MEMBERS OF THIS ASSOCIATION SHOULD DISCOUNTENANCE ALL SUCH PROFESSIONAL AMALGAMATION AND IN CONDUCTING BUSINESS AT THE COUNTER SHOULD AVOID PRESCRIBING FOR DISEASES WHEN PRACTI CABLE REFERRING APPLICANTS FOR MEDICAL ADVICE TO THE PHYSICIAN WE HOLD IT AS UN PROFESSIONAL AND HIGHLY REPREHENSIBLE FOR APOTHECARIES TO ALLOW ANY PERCENTAGE OR COMMISSION TO PHYSICIANS ON THEIR PRESCRIP TIONS AS UNJUST TO THE PUBLIC AND HURTFUL TO THE INDEPENDENCE AND SELFRESPECT OF BOTH PARTIES CONCERNED WE ALSO CONSIDER THAT THE PRACTICE OF SOME PHYSICIANS IN PLACES WHERE GOOD APOTHECARIES ARE NUMEROUS OF OBTAINING MEDICINES AT LOW PRICES FROM THE LATTER AND SELLING THEM TO THEIR PATIENTS IS NOT ONLY UNJUST AND UNPROFESSIONAL BUT DESERVING THE CENSURE OF ALL HIGHMINDED MEDICAL MEN ART 5THE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE EXERT ED ON THE PRACTICE OF PHARMACY BY THE LARGE PROPORTION OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE RESIGNED ITS DUTIES AND EMOLUMENTS TO THE APOTHE CARY ARE REASONS WHY HE SHOULD SEEK THEIR FAVORABLE OPINION AND CULTIVATE THEIR FRIEND SHIP BY EARNEST ENDEAVORS TO FURNISH THEIR PATIENTS WITH PURE AND WELLPREPARED MEDI CINES AS PHYSICIANS ARE LIABLE TO COMMIT ERRORS IN WRITING THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS INVOLV ING SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO HEALTH AND REPU TATION IF PERMITTED TO LEAVE THE SHOP THE APOTHECARY SHOULD ALWAYS WHEN HE DEEMS AN ERROR HAS BEEN MADE CONSULT THE PHYSI CIAN BEFORE PROCEEDING YET IN THE DELAY WHICH MUST NECESSARILY OCCUR IT IS HIS DUTY WHEN POSSIBLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE INTERVIEW WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE REPUTATION OF THE PHYSICIAN ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN APOTHECARIES COMMIT ERRORS INVOLVING ILL CONSEQUENCES THE PHYSICIAN KNOWING THE CONSTANT LIABILITY TO ERROR SHOULD FEEL BOUND TO SCREEN THEM FROM UNDUE CENSURE UNLESS THE RESULT OF A CULPABLE NEGLIGENCE ART 6AS WE OWE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO OUR PREDECESSORS FOR THE RESEARCHES AND OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE SO FAR ADVANCED OUR SCIENTIFIC ART WE HOLD THAT EVERY APOTHE CARY AND DRUGGIST IS BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HIS MITE TOWARD THE SAME FUND BY NOTING THE NEW IDEAS AND PHENOMENA WHICH MAY OCCUR IN THE COURSE OF HIS BUSINESS AND PUBLISHING THEM WHEN OF SUFFICIENT CONSEQUENCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PROFESSION THIS CODE OF ETHICS IS EVIDENTLY IN NEED OF REVISION THE FOLLOWING CODE IS PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL ASSOCIATION IN THE AUTUMN OF 1922

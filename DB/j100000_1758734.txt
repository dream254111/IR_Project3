Professor Jules Marcou The signature is taken from a letter addressed to the writer under date of Aug 13 1883 A HEARING OF BIRDS EARS1 III SECTION of bone is required for further ex amination of the ear parts There being no mastoid affair to be considered as such we may proceed directly to the  petrous part of the temporal the periotic or petrosal bone the otocrane or otic capsule enclosing the essential organ of audition just as the eyeball does that of vision or the ethmoid bone that of olfaction None of this bone is ordinarily recognizable on the outside of the skull though in the embryo that part which is in especial relation with the posterior semicircular canal appears to a slight extent upon the occiput The foundation of the bone is laid very early in cartilage traces of the cochlea and canals being visible in the chick at the fifth day of incubation if not sooner in the primitive car tilaginous basis cranii  the parachordal plate of cartilage on each side of the notochord On longitudinally bisecting the adult skull or otherwise gaining access to the braincavity the whole cerebral surface of the petrosal bone is brought into view as in fig 4 po op ep In a skull of any size as that of an eagle from which my description will be mainly derived there is no difficulty in making out the parts although the periphery of the petrosal is com pletely consolidated with surrounding bones The petrosal or periotic bone consists of three distinct bones which in some animals may remain long or permanently separate or be consolidated with surrounding bones and not with one another To see them it is usually necessary to examine a young skull like that figured These are the prootic po the opis thotic op the epiotic ep In the present case of the adult eagle they are absolutely fused with one another as well as with contiguous bones The consolidated petrosal appears as an irregular protuberance upon the inner wall of the braincavity much as the human pe trous bone protrudes between posterior and middle cerebral fossae It appears to be much more extensive than it really is because the superior semicircular canal too large to be accommodated in the petrosal invades the occipital bone the track of the canal being 1 Concluded from No 38 VOL II No 39 sculptured in basrelief as at asc fig 4 Behind this semicircular trace the deep groove of a venous sinus sc is engraved upon the bone throwing the track of the canal into still stronger relief The top of the petrosal and contiguous occipital surface floors a fossa which lodges the enormous optic lobes corpora bigemina of the brain in the eagle partly di vided from the general cavity for the cerebral hemisphere by a bony tentorium like that which in some mammals separates the cerebellar from the cerebral fossae On the vertical face of the petrosal or on the corresponding occipital sur face is a large smoothlipped orifice leading to a tonguelike excavation which lodges the floccn lus of the cerebellum and would therefore seem to correspond to that slight chink of the human petrous bone near the meatus internus which lodges a process of the dura mater In front between the petrosal and the alisphenoid or in the apposed border of one or the other of these bones is a considerable foramen the exit of the second and third divisions of the trifacial figs 1 and 4 the hole marked 5 Below the petrosal between opisthotic and exoccipital near theforamen magnum is a foramen which may be subdivided into foramina represent ing the human foramen lacerum posterius for transmission of the pneumogastric etc fig 4 the hole marked 8 Thus as always the bony auditory capsule lies between the exits of the third division of the trifacial and the pneumogastric The general space under de scription is continued to the margin of the foramen magnum by the exoccipital bone fig 4 eo Now on the vertical face of the petrosal itself and in the prootic part far behind the foramen marked 5 in fig 4 con siderably above that marked 8 will be seen the large smoothlipped orifice of the meatus auditorius internus marked 7 in the figure Here enter as usual both portio dura and portio mollis of the old seventh pair of cranial nerves At the bottom of the meatus are at least two openings small but separate from each other A bristle passed through the upper anterior one of these traces the course of portio dura the facial nerve through the fallopian aqueduct  nerviduct it would be better called and emerges in the tympanic cavity near the eustachian orifice This ori fice of exit of the facial is virtually a  stylo mastoid  foramen though within the tympanic for the nerve burrows through no more bone in reaching the surface of the skull A bristle passed through the other one of the two forami na at the bottom of the meatus practically traces the course of the portio mollis or auditory nerveSCIENCE and can also be made to come out into the tympanum either through the vestibular or cochlear opening fenestra ovalis or fenestra rotunda In the dry skull either passage is easily made without breaking down and ap parently without meeting any bony obstacle If now the whole periotic mass be cut away from the rest of the skull with a fine saw and then divided in any direction the bony labyrinth and essen tial organ of hearing can be studied It is best to make the   section in some def inite plane with re gard to the axes of the skull  the ver tical longitudinal or   vertical transverse or horizontal as the T disposition and rela  tions of the contained structures are then ii more readily made out Four or five par   allel cuts will make as many thin flat slices  of bone affording eight or ten surfaces  for examination The whole course of the labyrinthine struc tures can be seen in sections which put together in theminds  eye or held in hand a little apart and visibly threaded with bristles    afford the required picture very nicely F 4Ripe chicks skull Io x 3 diameters

direction will apply perfectly to all birds Whatever its inclination backward there is no mistaking d which is much the longest of the three looping high over the rest exceeding the petrosal and

of the canals with reference to the axes of the body nor to the direction of their loops neither is their mutual perpendicularity so nearly exhibited The whole set is tilted over backward to some extent so that the anterior though still superior canal d in figs 5 and 6 loops back beyond either of the others its anterior limb is also straightened out The posterior though still inferior canal f

as it were set within the loop of f its plane the opposite of that of f The bony cavities of e and f intercommunicate where they cross at or near the point of their iSCIENCE greatest convexity farthest away from the vestibule This decussation of e and f like the twining inosculation of f and d is well known It may not be so generally under stood that there is in the eagle I do not know whether or not in birds generally a third extravestibular communication of the bony canals My sections show this perfectly The great loop of d sweeping past the decus sation of e and fis thrown into a cavity com mon to all three Bristles threaded through each of the three canals can all be seen in contact crossing one another through this curious extravestibular chamber I call it the trivia or threeway place It is just where in fig 6 the three membranous canals decussate  midway between the letters ef and c It does not of course follow that the contained membranous canals intercom municate here and it appears from Ibsens figures that they do not The ampullar clilata tions of the ends of the canals are well marked The anatomy of associate soft parts is explained to some extent under fig 7 The endolymph may contain otoliths simi lar to those great concretions called ear stones in fishes The equilibrating function of the labyrinth and its fluid appears to have been determined mainly from experiments upon birds The apparatus may be likened to the glass tubes filled with water and a bubble of air by a combination of which a surveyor for example is enabled to adjust his theodolite true for a bird somehow knows how the liquid stands in these selfregistering levelling tubes and adjusts itself accordingly Observations made upon pigeons show that  when the membranous canals are divided very remark able disturbances of equilibrium ensue which vary in character according to the seat of the lesion When the horizontal canals are di vided rapid movements of the head from side to side in a horizontal plane take place along with oscillation of the eyeballs and the animal tends to spin round on a vertical axis When the posterior or inferior vertical canals are di vided the head is moved rapidly backwards and forwards and the animal tends to exe cute a backward somersault head over heels When the superior vertical canals are divided the head is moved rapidly forwards and back wards and the animal tends to execute a for ward somersault heels over head Combined section of the various canals causes the most bizarre contortions of the head and body Ferrier Funct of the brain

engaging creatures derive pleas ure from their own music Though no two things can well be conceived more different than an anatomical disquisition and a bird song either may be made to subserve the

general circulation of the winds is at times interrupted by local and temporary dis tnrbances of very varied size and strength to which the general name of  storms is given Their most constant features are a more or less pronounced inward spiral whirling of the air near the ground feeding an updraught at the centre and an outflow above  and a progressive motion from place to place along a tolerably welldefined track Clouds and generally rain as well accompany the larger storms It is our object to explain how these disturb ances arise to examine the causes and methods of their peculiar action and to study their dis tribution in time and place With this end in view the small dustwhirlwinds that commonly arise in the hot dry air of deserts will be first considered Next will come the great hurri canes and typhoons of the tropical seas and the less violent rotary storms of our own lati tudes all of which may be grouped together as cyclones The tornadoes and waterspouts showing a peculiar concentration of power over a very limited area will be discussed last The dry whirlwinds in flat desert regions suddenly interrupt the calmness of the air and begin turning catching up dust and sand and carrying them upwards through the spiral vortex to a height of many hundred feet They are therefore not at all like those whirls formed about our streetcorners at the meeting of opposing currents of blustering wind or the eddies of greater strength seen in windy moun tain regions for they arise in a time of quiet and begin their motion without apparent cause Hence we must at the outset inquire into the 1 Based on a series of lectures delivered at the Lowell insti tute Boston in January 1883 NOVEMBER 2 1883

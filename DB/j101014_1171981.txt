devoted more effort to housing reform than any other city in America notwithstanding this its needs today are greater than those of any other American city That is due to the magnitude of the problem for New York has over 00000 separate tenement houses whereas in most American cities the tenement house is the exception rather than the rule The outlook in the city is dis tinctly encouraging The presentday tenement house built under the existing law is the best type of structure in the city of New York In fact it is the only kind of building except theaters which has the safeguards that we have been taught to believe essential for the preservation of life health and morality The onefamily house has not these safeguards nor has the twofamily house The Asch building fire called attention forci bly to the fact that lofts factories and office buildings lack these safeguards The tenement house as built today comes nearest of any building to being properly protected but it is still very inadequate in many particulars From the ideal point of view New Yorks greatest housing need is a thorough revision of the tenementhouse law That is a difficult thing to bring about It would be advantageous if we could materially increase the minimum width of courts not the inner court 24 feet wide but the narrower one only six feet and six inches Similarly it is highly desirable to increase the size of the back yard to allow more light at the rear of the building but it is practically impossible to do it by law Un less we wait until the time is ripe changes in the law are likely to mean not progress but retrogression The legislative game is a dangerous one Read at the meeting of the Academy of Political Science April I8 I912 662HOUSING NEEDS The next need is the regulation of houses other than tene ments A dark inner bedroom in a twofamily house is just as dangerous from the point of view of tuberculosis as one in a three or fourfamily house The twofamily houses which are building in the outskirts of our city are practically unregulated They may have no yards no windows no toilet facilities and no running water rooms may be as small as the builder wishes to make them and absolutely dark of all the safeguards thrown around the tenement dweller none is provided in the two or onefamily house In many of our progressive western cities on the other hand the housing laws apply to the one and two family houses and the same requirement should be made in Greater New York The great field of building operations of residence building is in Queens and in the Bronx This is often forgotten by residents of Manhattan actually more theaters than private residences were built in the borough of Manhattan last year The farsighted student however will look to the future of the outlying boroughs Much can be done in improving the enforcement of the ten ement house law by cooperation with the tenementhouse department which is doing admirable work It is important to find out the facts and get at the view of the public official to see the limitations under which he is working and give him due credit for the good work he has done as well as to hold him responsible for poor work Another housing need is the education of tenants The great mass of tenementhouse dwellers in New York city need to be taught how to live A large part of the housing evils in American cities are due to the people themselves to their ignorance their lack of leisure time and their undue hours of labor These all make it easy to fall into bad habits of living Similarly the landlords and builders ought to be educated That is a much more difficult task than the education of tenants and yet it is not a hopeless one The height of buildings ought to be regulated and especially the erection of high buildings ought to be checked in the outlying districts of the city There are large stretches in Queens and Richmond and the Bronx nothing more than farm land amid which five and sixstory 4 3  663 I89ORG4ANIZA TION FOR SOCIAL WORK tenement houses are going up That should be restricted by law It is serious not only for tenants in the outlying districts but even for the business sections of the city People in gen eral are beginning to realize that unregulated building is not a wise thing for them for their investment or for the community New York is doing little about cityplanning Many of the housing evils in this city have been due to the lot I00 feet deep no matter what its width Yet we are cutting up farm land and acreage today and making it into lots 20 feet by I20 and o00 feet That is happening all over America and it is preparing trouble for future generations It could all be obviated by a wise study of the possibilities of the small lot of shallow depth and sometimes of narrow width As to room overcrowding no city in America has ever done anything Some persons believe that it affects this community more than any other evil but we have no data to warrant any definite conclusion Notwithstanding all these needs New York is strongly to be commended for having done so much She has done more in the last ten years in the cause of housing reform than any other city in the world has done in the same length of time and more than any other American city is doing today 664 I90

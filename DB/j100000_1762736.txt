National prosperity My attention has been called to the comments of Mr C H Leete upon my January article in the Century magazine Mr Leete objects tomaking the year 1865 a basis for the comparison of progress The details of each year were given and he could choose for himself any year in the series from which to date progress Perhaps it may be interesting to submit the enclosed more ample table showing prog ress from 1870 up to the present date In respect to cotton the antewar crops are given as well as the postwar crops The gain subsequent to the war as compared to the twentyone years previous to the war has been much greater than before for the reason that for every cent per pound added to the price of cotton under the slave system 100 was VOL IX No 210 property insured against loss by fire they represent the progress of the million in the means of common welfare rather than of the millionnaire in personal wealth and that they give testimony to the benefi cent law of progress from poverty EDWARD ATKINSON Boston Feb 7 Youthfulness in science Your artice upon  Youthfulness in science Sci ence ix No 209 illustrates a most radical defect in our educational system It does not seem to be the chief purpose to incite the student to weigh evidence and secure accurate knowledge prizing above every thing the ability to form correct judgments in regard to the significance of observed facts It is not even assumed that he can have any other feeling in his studies than a selfish desire for personal renown or advancement respect for or love of truth and knowl edge for their own sake being entirely out of the case Instead of being taught to profit by criticism Per centum of gain in population production wealth and savings 1870 to 1885 and on some items to

slave The planters could not buy labor fast enough to keep up with the demand This principle was completely stated in DeBows review and it was one of the causes which induced the extreme proslavery men of the south to attempt to reopen the slavetrade be fore the war Mr Leete calls attention to the retardation in the gain of population since the war as compared to the previous period from 1850 to 1860 It does not re quire much thought to comprehend the reason of that retardation Mr Leete asks why progress and wealth may not be predicated on the assessed value of real and per sonal property I have endeavored to prove progress in the accumulation of capital without including land People do not insure land against loss by fire only property of other kinds Moreover the census figures of the past upon these points are all rubbish as every expert of the census well knows It strikes me that Mr Leete makes a good example of the common saying about statistics that one can twist the figures if he chooses so as to prove any thing that he desires to prove No one compre hends this better than the man who is accustomed to compile statistics The value of statistics depends wholly upon the motive with which they have been gathered the purpose for which they have been com piled and an exact regard to truth In considering these relative gains it will be ob served that they represent a constant gain in the means of subsistence over population that with the exception of the increase in personal wealth which is indicated by the increase in the amount of 48 85 86 88 he is led to dread it Moreover he finds that his educators instead of admitting frankly that to err is human and that all alike must learn to profit by their mistakes are apparently most concerned in seeking to maintain a reputation for infallibility by contributing nothing whatever to the advancement of knowledge It is not strange that progress is slow where such a spirit prevails M A VEEDEB Lyons NY Feb 5 Germ of hydrophobia I have not observed in your columns a reference to what appears to be an exceedingly important com munication by Professor Fol of Geneva to the Swiss natural history society mith regard to the bacillus of rabies which he claims to have isolated According to the Biologisches centralblatt Dec 51 Professor Fol finds that turpentine even water which has been shaken up with turpentine acts as an effective germicide when added to pure cultures of this bacillus and that it is even more effectual than a one per cent solution of corrosive sublimate He considers consequently that turpentine might be used as a substitute for the actual cautery in the treatment of recent bites especially in places such as the face where the cautery would produce great dis figurement No suggestions are made as to applica tion but if experiments on animals should justify Professor Fols view it would be desirable to give it as wide publicity as possible Univers coll Toronto Feb 3 R RAMSAY WRIGHT I I I I I

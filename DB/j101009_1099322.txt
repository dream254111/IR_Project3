FOLLOWS  THAT A STANDING COMMITTEE IS HEREBY CONSTITUTED UNDER THE NAME OF THE COM MITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO CONSIST OF FIVE MEMBERS ONE TO BE SBLECTED FROM EACH GEOGRAPHICAL SECTION OF THE STATE WHOSE DUTY IT SHALL BE GENERALLY TO REPRESENT THE BAR OF THIS STATE IN FURTHERING THE CAUSE OF FRIENDLY SETTLEMENT OF ALL INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES THIS ACTION WAS TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO A

TRIBUNAL TO WHICH SHOULD BE REFERRED FOR PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT ALL CONTROVERSIES ARIS ING BETWEEN ENGLISHSPEAKING PEOPLE THE BAR ASSOCIATIONS OF MOST OF THE STATES HAVE ADOPTED SIMILAR MEASURES THE

BY THE PROFESSION IN AMERICA IN PROMO TION OF THIS NOBLE OBJECT IN THE CONFERENCEROOM OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AT A BANQUET TENDERED TO MR JUSTICE HARLAN ON OCTOBER 3 1896 BY THE BAR OF THE CITY OF CINCINNATI OHIO IN HONOR OF HIS INITIAL APPEARANCE IN THAT CITY AS THE JUSTICE OF THE SIXTH CIRCUIT UNDER RECENT ALLOTMENT THE LEARNED JUSTICE RESPONDED TO THE TOAST THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ITS WORK IN THE COURSE OF HIS REMARKS JUSTICE HARLAN GAVE THE FOLLOWING INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THE MODE IN WHICH THE WORK OF THE COURT IS DISTRIBUTED AMONGST THE SEVERAL JUDGES AND OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH FINAL CONCLUSIONS ARE REACHED AND OPINIONS MOULDED INTO SHAPE FOR JUDICIAL UTTERANCE A SENSE OF THE CARE AND LABOR THUS BESTOWED TENDS TO ENHANCE OUR RESPECT FOR THAT GREAT COURT AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR FAITH IN THE JUSTNESS AND CORRECTNESS OF ITS DECISIONS  IN MY INTERCOURSE WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE BAR I HAVE FOUND TO MY GREAT SUR PRISE THAT THE IMPRESSION PREVAILS WITH SOME THAT CASES AFTER BEING SUBMITTED ARE DIVIDED AMONG THE JUDGES AND THAT THE COURT BASES ITS JUDGMENT IN EACH ONE WHOLLY UPON THE REPORT MADE BY SOME ONE JUDGE TO WHOM THAT CASE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED FOR EXAMINATION AND REPORT I HAVE MET WITH LAWYERS WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVED THAT THE OPINION WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE CASE WAS DECIDED IN CONFERENCE AND THAT THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE COURT WHO FULLY EXAMINED THE RECORD AND BRIEFS WAS THE ONE WHO PREPARED THE OPINION IT IS MY DUTY TO SAY THAT THE BUSINESS IN OUR COURT IS NOT CONDUCTED IN ANY SUCH MODE EACH JUSTICE IS FURNISHED WITH A PRINTED COPY OF THE RECORD AND WITH A COPY OF EACH BRIEF FILED AND EACH ONE EXAMINES THE RECORD AND BRIEFS AT HIS CHAMBERS BEFORE THE CASE IS TAKEN UP FOR CONSIDERATION THE CASES ARE THOROUGHLY DSSCUSSED IN CONFERENCETHE DISCUSSION IN SOME BEING NECESSARILY MORE EXTENDED THAN IN OTHERS THE DISCUSSION BEING CONCLUDEDAND IT IS NEVER CONCLUDED UNTIL EACH MEMBER OF THE COURT HAS SAID ALL THAT HE DESIRES TO SAYTHE ROLL IS CALLED AND EACH JUSTICE PRESENT AND PARTICIPATING IN THE DECISION VOTES TO AFFIRM REVERSE OR MODIFY AS HIS EXAMINATION AND REFLECTION SUGGESTS THE CHIEF JUSTICE AFTER THE CONFERENCE AND WITHOUT CONSULTING HIS BRETHREN DISTRIBUTES THE CASES SO DECIDED FOR OPINIONS NO JUSTICE KNOWS AT THE TIME HE VOTES IN A PARTICULAR CASE THAT HE WILL BE ASKED TO BECOME THE ORGAN OF THE COURT IN THAT CASE NOR DOES ANY MEMBER OF THE COURT ASK THAT A PARTICULAR CASE BE ASSIGNED TO HIM THE NEXT STEP IS THE PREPARATION OF THE OPINION BY THE JUSTICE TO WHOM IT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED THE OPINION WHEN PREPARED IS PRIVATELY PRINTED AND A COPY PLACED IN THE HANDS OF EACH MEMBER OF THE COURT FOR EXAMINATION AND CRITICISM IT IS EXAMINED BY EACH JUSTICE AND RETURNED TO THE AUTHOR WITH SUCH CRITICISMS AND OBJECTIONS AS ARE DEEMED NECESSARY IF THESE OBJECTIONS ARE OF A SERIOUS KIND AFFECTING THE GENERAL TREND OF THE OPINION THE WRITER CALLS THE ATTENTION OF THE JUSTICES TO THEM THAT THEY MAY BE PASSED UPON THE AUTHOR ADOPTS SUCH SUGGES TIONS OF MERE FORM AS MEET HIS VIEWS IF OBJECTIONS ARE MADE TO WHICH THE WRITERVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DOES NOT AGREE THEY ARE CONSIDERED IN CONFERENCE AND ARE SUSTAINED OR OVERRULED AS THE MAJORITY MAY DETERMINE THE OPINION IS REPRINTED SO AS TO EXPRESS THE FINAL CONCLUSIONS OF THE COURT AND IS THEN FILED THUS YOU WILL OBSERVE NOT ONLY IS THE UTMOST CARE TAKEN TO MAKE THE OPINION EXPRESS THE VIEWS OF THE COURT BUT THAT THE FINAL JUDGMENT RESTS IN EVERY CASE DE CIDED UPON THE EXAMINATION BY EACH MEMBER OF THE COURT OF THE RECORD AND BRIEFS LET ME SAY THAT DURING MY ENTIRE SERVICE IN THE SUPREME COURT I HAVE NOT KNOWN A SINGLE INSTANCE IN WHICH THE COURT HAS DETERMINED A CASE MERELY UPON THE REPORT OF ONE OR MORE JUSTICES AS TO WHAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE RECORD AND AS TO WHAT QUESTIONS WERE PROPERLY PRESENTED BY IT WHEN YOU FIND AN OPINION OF THE COURT ON FILE AND PUBLISHED THE PROFESSION HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE IT AS EXPRESSING THE DELIBERATE VIEWS OF THE COURT BASED UPON A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE RECORDS AND BRIEFS BY EACH JUSTICE PARTICIPATING IN THE JUDGMENT CONSTITUTIONAL LAWRIGHT OF STATE TO CONFER CITIZENSHIP WHATEVER VIEW MAY

PRIVILEGE OF SUFFRAGE THE STATE AS WE HAVE SEEN MAY CONFER IT UPON ALIENS WHO HAVE NO INTEREST WHATEVER IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THEREFORE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

PLAINTIFF WAS A NATIVE OF SAXONY BUT HAD RESIDED IN MINNE SOTA FOR TWENTYEIGHT YEARS AND SINCE EARLY INFANCY HAVING DECLARED HIS INTEN TION TO BECOME A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES HE WAS ENTITLED UNDER THE LAWS OF MINNESOTA TO ALL THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP BUT ALTHOUGH HE HAD ENJOYED THE BENEFITS OF THIS GENEROUS POLICY BY VOTING AT THE LATEST CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION HAVING OCCASION SHORTLY AFTERWARDS TO SUE THE CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS HE FOUND IT TO HIS INTEREST TO DENY HIS CITIZENSHIP AND TO INSTITUTE HIS SUIT IN THE FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE ALLEGATION THAT HE WAS A SUBJECT OF THE KING OF SAXONY THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THE COURT TO DO BUT TO ENTERTAIN JURISDICTION WHICH IT ACCORDINGLY DID ON THE GROUNDS ALREADY STATED IN A VALUABLE NOTE TO THIS CASE IN 6 C C A 37 MR H CAMPBELL BLACK THE EDITOR HAS COLLECTED AND DISCUSSED THE AUTHORITIES ON THIS INTERESTING QUESTION SUMMONING CORPORATIONS BY PUBLICATIONIT IS BELIEVED THAT A GENERAL MISUNDERSTANDING EXISTS AMONGST THE PROFESSION OF THIS STATE AS TO THE METHOD OF SUMMONING CORPORATIONS BY PUBLICATION THIS IMPRESSION IS DERIVED FROM NUMER OUS ORDERS OF PUBLICATION WHICH WE HAVE OBSERVED IN THE NEWSPAPERS WHEREIN THE DRAUGHTSMAN HAS DISREGARDED THE PLAIN DIRECTIONS OF THE STATUTE UNDER WHICH SER VICE BY PUBLICATION IS AUTHORIZED THE ERROR IS DUE TO A FAILURE TO OBSERVE THAT ORDERS OF PUBLICATION AGAINST INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS AND AGAINST CORPORATIONS DE FENDANT ARE GOVERNED BY ESSENTIALLY DISTINCT STATUTES UNDER THE VIRGINIA CODE OF 1873 INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS WERE SUMMONED BY ORDERS OF PUBLICATION UNDER CHAP 166 SEC 10 THAT IS TO SAY UPON PROPER AFFI DAVIT FILED THE CLERK ENTERED AN ORDER REQUIRING THE DEFENDANT TO APPEAR WITHIN A PRESCRIBED TIME AFTER DUE PUBLICATION OF THE ORDER AND DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO PROTECT HIS INTEREST WHERE A CORPORATION WAS TO BE SUMMONED BY PUBLICATION SECTION 7 OF THE SAME CHAPTER PRESCRIBED THAT PUBLICATION OF A COPY OF THE PRO CESS OR NOTICE AS AN ORDER IS PUBLISHED UNDER SECTION 11 OF THIS CHAPTER SHALL TOGETHER BE SUFFICIENT THIS SECTION 11 WAS DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE PUBLICATION OF SUM MONS ISSUING FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS THE PROVISION BEING THAT THE CLERK SHOULD ISSUE THE ORDER ON THE FIRST MONDAY IN A MONTH REQUIRING THE DEFENDANT TO APPEAR 1896 545 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES546 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER NOV ON A CERTAIN DAY DESIGNATED IN THE ORDER SECTION 14 OF THE SAME CHAPTER DIRECTED THAT  EVERY ORDER OF PUBLICATION SHALL STATE BRIEFLY THE OBJECT OF THE SUIT AND RE QUIRE THE DEFENDANTS AGAINST WHOM IT IS ENTERED   TO APPEAR WITHIN ONE MONTH AFTER DUE PUBLICATION AND DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS SO THAT WHILE IT IS NOT ALTOGETHER CLEAR WHAT IS MEANT BY THE PROVISION IN THE 7TH SEC TION WITH REFERENCE TO CORPORATIONS THAT  PUBLICATION OF A COPY OF THE PROCESS OR NOTICE AS AN ORDER IS PUBLISHED UNDER SECTION 11 OF THIS CHAPTER SHALL TOGETHER BE SUFFICIENT  IT IS CLEAR ENOUGH THAT THE PROCESS OR NOTICE WAS ITSELF TO BE PUBLISHED AND NOT THE MERE ORDER ENTERED BY THE CLERK PROBABLY BY THE USE OF THE WORD TOGETHER IT WAS INTENDED THAT BOTH THE PROCESS IN THE SUIT AND THE ORDER DIRECT ING THE PUBLICATION SHOULD BE PUBLISHED TOGETHER AT ANY RATE THE CODE OF 1873 DRAWS A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE METHOD OF SUMMONING INDIVIDUALS BY PUBLICATION AND THAT OF SUMMONING CORPORATIONS WHATEVER ELSE WAS NECESSARY IN SUCH A PROCEEDING AGAINST A CORPORATION CERTAINLY THE PROCESS IN THE SUIT MUST HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BUT AFTER THIS SUMMONS AGAINST THE CORPORATION WAS IN PROPER SHAPE FOR PUBLICATION NO FURTHER DISTINCTION WAS MADE BETWEEN THE CORPORA TION AND THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANT AND EACH BECAME SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER 166 REGULATING ORDERS OF PUBLICATION GENERALLY THAT IS TO SAY THE SUM MONS AGAINST THE CORPORATION WHATEVER ITS FORM MAY HAVE BEEN WAS PUBLISHED AND POSTED PRECISELY AS IF THE DEFENDANT HAD BEEN AN INDIVIDUAL THIS LONGWINDED PREFACE BRINGS US TO THE POINT WHICH WE DESIRED TO MAKE VIZ THAT WHILE SEC 7 OF CHAP 166 PRESCRIBED WHAT THE FORM OF THE PUBLICATION AGAINST CORPORATIONS SHOULD BE AND REQUIRED THE PROCESS IN THE SUIT TO BE PUBLISHED THE METHOD OF GIVING IT REQUISITE PUBLICITY WAS LEFT TO THE GENERAL PROVISIONS OF THAT CHAPTER ON THE SUBJECT AND WAS THE SAME FOR INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS BY THE CODE OF 1887 A RADICAL CHANGE WAS WROUGHT SEC 3225 OF THE LATER CODE REPRESENTING SEC 7 OF CHAP 166 OF THE FORMER CODE MAKES FULL PROVISION NOT ONLY FOR THE FORM OF THE SUMMONS AGAINST CORPORATIONS UPON WHOM PROCESS CANNOT BE SERVED BUT FOR THE METHOD OF PUBLICATION AS WELL AND DOES NOT ADOPT AS DID THE CODE OF 1873 THE GENERAL METHOD AGAINST INDIVIDUALS SEC 3225 OF THE CODE OF 1887 PROVIDES THAT WHERE THERE IS NO AGENT ETC UPON WHOM SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST OR NOTICE TO A CORPORATION CAN BE MADE  PUBLICATION OF A COPY OF THE PROCESS OR NOTICE ONCE A WEEK FOR FOUR SUCCESSIVE WEEKS IN A NEWSPA PER PRINTED IN THIS STATE SHALL BE A SUFFICIENT SERVICE OF SUCH PROCESS OR NOTICE  WHEN THE PUBLICATION IS OF PROCESS IT SHALL BE MADE ON AN ORDER DIRECTING THE SAME IN THE CASE IN WHICH THE PROCESS ISSUES THE ORDER MAY BE ENTERED EITHER IN COURT OR BY THE CLERK IN VACATION IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THIS SECTION PROVIDES IN DETAIL 1 WHAT IS TO BE PUB LISHEDVIZ THE PROCESS IN THE SUIT AND NOTHING ELSE 2 HOW LONG IT IS TO BE PUB LISHEDVIZ FOUR WEEKS 3 WHERE IT IS TO BE PUBLISHEDVIZ IN A NEWSPAPER PRINTED IN THIS STATE 4 BY WHOM THE ORDER TO PUBLISH IS ISSUEDVIZ THE COURT OR CLERK AND 5 THE EFFECTVIZ IT SHALL BE A SUFFCIENT SERVICE OF THE PROCESS THERE IS NO NEED TO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR FORM OR METHODS AS THERE WAS UNDER THE OLD SECTION IN THE CODE OF 1873 FOR WHICH THIS SECTION IS A SUBSTITUTE SEC 7 CHAP 166 NOW IF WE TURN TO SECTION 3230 OF THE CODE OF 1887 AND THE THREE SECTIONS FOL LOWING WE FIND ELABORATE PROVISIONS MADE FOR ENTERING AND PUBLISHING ORDERS OF PUBLICATION GENERALLY THE FORM AND METHODS ARE GIVEN IN DETAIL THESE DIFFER1896 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES 547 RADICALLY FROM THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3225 QUOTED ABOVE THESE DIFFERENCES WILL BE POINTED OUT AT LENGTH PRESENTLY CLEARLY NONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THESE LATER SECTIONS APPLIES TO CORPORATIONS THE ERROR TO WHICH WE REFERRED AS COMMON IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS DISCUSSION IS IN SUPPOSING THAT THESE PROVISIONS OR SOME OF THEM DO APPLY TO CBRPORATIONS BUT IF THEY DO WHAT IS THE NEED OF THE PRO VISIONS OF SECTION 3225 JUST NOTICED IF A PLAINTIFF SUING A FOREIGN CORPORATION SHOULD MAKE THE AFFIDAVIT REQUIRED BY SECTION 3225 SHOULD HAVE PROCESS ISSUED IN THE SUIT SHOULD OBTAIN AN ORDER FROM THE CLERK TO PUBLISH THIS PROCESS IN A PARTICULAR NEWSPAPER ONCE A WEEK FOR FOUR WE1 SHOULD PUBLISH THAT PROCESS AND NOTHING ELSE ACCORDINGLYOMITTING ANY PUBLICATION OF THE ORDER ITSELF OR TNY POST ING FOR THE STATUTE REQUIRES NEITHER OF THESEWOULD NOT THE DEFENDANT CORPORA TION BE DULY SUMMONED THE STATUTE ANSWERS THE QUESTION BY PROVIDING THAT SUCH METHOD SHALL BE SUFFICIENT SO THAT WHEN A PLAINTIFF PROCEEDS AGAINST A CORPORATION AND DISREGARDING THESE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 3225 ADOPTS THE METHODS PRESCRIBED BY SEC 3230 AND THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS WE HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN CONCLUDING THAT SUCH SERVICE IS INVALID FOR ALL PURPOSES CONSTRUING THE TWO SECTIONS 3225 AND 3230 TOGETHER IT IS CLEAR THAT SECTION 3230 APPLIES AS EXCLUSIVELY TO INDIVIDUALS AS SECTION 3225 DOES TO CORPORATIONS OTHERWISE WE CONVICT THE REVISORS OF THE CODE OF 1887 OF THE ABSURDITY OF PRE SCRIBING TWO METHODS OF SUMMONING CORPORATIONS BY PUBLICATION AND BUT ONE IN CASE OF INDIVIDUALS THE LANGUAGE OF SECTION 3230 ITSELF INDICATES ITS OBVIOUS REFERENCE TO INDIVIDUALS ALONE ON AFFIDAVIT SAYS THIS SECTION THAT A DEFEND ANT IS NOT A RESIDENT OF THIS STATE OR THAT DILIGENCE HAS BEEN USED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF TO ASCERTAIN IN WHAT COUNTY OR CORPORATION HE IS WITHOUT EFFECT OR THAT PROCESS DIRECTED TO THE OFFICER OF THE COUNTY OR CORPORATION IN WHICH HE RESIDES OR IS HAS BEEN TWICE DELIVERED TO SUCH OFFICER MORE THAN TEN DAYS BEFORE THE RETURN DAY AND BEEN RETURNED WITHOUT BEING EXECUTED OR THAT THE DEFENDANT IN A SUIT FOR A DIVORCE FROM THE BOND OF MATRIMONY IS UNDER SENTENCE TO CONFINEMENT IN THE PENITENTIARY AN ORDER OF PUBLICATION SHALL BE ENTERED AGAINST SUCH DEFENDANT THE NEXT SECTION 3231 DIRECTS THAT EVERY ORDER OF PUBLICATION SHALL GIVE THE ABBREVIATED STYLE OF THE SUIT STATE BRIEFLY ITS OBJECT AND REQUIRE THE DEFENDANTS AGAINST WHOM IT IS ENTERED    TO APPEAR WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER DUE PUB LICATION THEREOF AND DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS IT SHALL BE PUBLISHED ONCE A WEEK FOR FOUR SUCCESSIVE WEEKS IN SUCH NEWSPAPER AS THE COURT MAY PRESCRIBE OR IF NONE BE PRESCRIBED AS THE CLERK MAY DIRECT AND SHALL BE POSTED BY THE CLERK AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE COURTHOUSE OF THE COUNTY OR CORPORA TION WHEREIN THE COURT IS HELD ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEXT COUNTY OR CORPORATION COURT AFTER IT IS ENTERED CLEARLY NONE OF THESE PROVISIONS IS APPLICABLE TO THE PUBLICATION OF PROCESS AGAINST CORPORATIONS UNDER SEC 3225 PROCESS UNDER SEC 3225 DOES NOT  GIVE THE ABBREVIATED STYLE OF THE SUIT BUT THE NAMES OF THE PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS IN FULL NOR DOES IT STATE BRIEFLY ITS OBJECT BUT SIMPLY WHETHER THE SUIT IS IN DEBT ASSUMPSIT COVENANT ETC OR IN CHANCERY IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE DEFENDANT TO APPEAR WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER DUE PUBLICATION BUT TO ANY RULE DAY WITHIN NINETY DAYS HENCE NONE OF THESE PROVISIONS OF SEC 3230 CAN BE HELD TO BE APPLICABLE TO THE PUBLICATION OF PROCESS AGAINST CORPORATIONS THE FOLLOWING

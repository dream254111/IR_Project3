the opinion of the court was delivered by Judge Riely The opinion was prepared and delivered by Judge Cardwell and the other Judges concurred The error will not be repeated in the official report 93 Va SAMS ON ATTACHMENTWe are indebted to the publishers The J W Ran dolph Company of Richmond for a copy of a new work on Attachments under the Virginia and West Virginia Statutes by Mr Conway Whittle Sams of the Norfolk bar We have examined it carefully enough to be able to recommend it to the profession of the two States as a most laborious and conscientious work and one which must become the leading textbook on this difficult and important sub ject in the States named We shall take occasion to notice the book at length hereafter WE sincerely hope that the recent change of the law regulating admission to the bar will not result in so contracting their number that there will not be lawyers enough to keep our legal machinery going We learn that there has not been a single application for admission filed since July 1 when the new law took effect which may mean that everybody got in under the old law or that the new law has set wouldbe applicants to work to learn some of the rudiments of the law This may indeed be hard upon the applicants but it is money in the pockets of clients and corn and wine and oil to the courts We are trembling to hear from some sonofwind a denunciation of the new law as the crime of 96 THi VIRGINIA LAW REGISTERWe take the following notice of the July No of the REGISTER from The Docket San Antonio Texas edited by Judge J H McLeary The VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER is in its second volume and is certainly a very creditable publication and fills the position of a State law journal perfectly The leading article is a biographical sketch of Judge John W Brockenbrough a name honored and respected not only throughout Virginia but every other State in the1896 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES 541 Union His pupils are numbered by the hundreds and have taken a high stand at the bar in all of the Southern States and many of the North and West The sketch written by Prof Graves recites in modest language the most noticeable achievements of this celebrated jurist and will serve to remind former students of the law department of Washington and Lee University of the preceptor who claims the first place in their respect and affection among whom is the editor of this journal THE COURT OF APPEALS adjourned its session at Staunton oi the 5th of Octo ber to reconvene at Richmond on the 10th of November instead of the 5th as heretofore CASKS The court called through the docket  46 Heard and determined  29 Dismissed     4 Continued records not printed 10 Continued by the parties  2 Removed to Richmond  146 Opinions delivered   18 Ordered to be reported 17 Not to be reported 118 Cases in the hands of the court in which opinions are to be prepared  11 It is supposed that these opinions will be prepared in vacation by the Judges to whom the cases are respectively assigned andbe delivered as soon as the session at Richmond begins The Clerk at Richmond informs us that the cases matured as of the 6th of October are as follows and to be heard in the following order 1 Commonwealths Cases  6 2 M otions   2 3 Privileged Cases  9 4 Regular Argument Docket 131 Total  147 It is probable that a few other cases may be matured and put on the docket be fore the court meets on the 1dth of November Of the five Commonwealths cases two are criminal cases and three civil cases Of the three civil cases it is said that one will be dismissed agreed and the other two await the determination of a case pending in the Supreme Court of the United States So that the regular argument docket will be reached very soon after the court convenes May we not indulge the hope that the entire docket may be called through during the session three consecutive terms lasting about six months If it could be what a blessingl It is however barely possible even with such a working court as we have but the prospect is that the docket will at all events be so far reduced as in the future to enable the court to dispose of all the cases at one sessionVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER A COMPLETE DIGEST OF THE VIRGINIA REPORTS From Jeffersons Reports to 92 Virginia Reports 17301896We have been favored with advance sheets of the Complete Digest qovering the titles AbandonmentAdvancement The authors are Hon R M Brown exJudge Fifteenth Circuit of Virginia and S N Hurst Esq author of Hursts Guide and Manual We congratulate these gentlemen upon the fidelity with which their arduous task is being performed judging by the sheets which are before us They fully bear out the following description of their work given by the learned digesters in a Special Notice to the Bar dated June 1896  The authors have revised their MS making it include 91 Va and the cases to be reported in 92 Va the paging whereof being cited in blank They have also carefully revised their notes which are copious and not only show the present status of the case whether overruled c but also give parallel citations to the Code c and whenever a case depends upon a statute the statute is cited and also the statute as it exists in the present Code and amendments thereto and whenever light is thereby thrown upon the subject intermediate statutes are also cited Thus an attorney has in a nutshell the present law as construed by our court of last resort with statutory modifications It is announced that the Digest will consist of about five not exceeding six volumes  The last volume will be an Index containing a table of all cases de cided by our court of last resort arranged alphabetically in names of both plaintiff and defendant and a complete list of all cases overruled distinguis ed doubted or explained together with a full and complete subjectindex We trust that this important and laborious work may receive from the profession the encouragement and support it deserves C A G INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATIONBy an amendment to the constitution of the Virginia State Bar Association carried by unanimous vote at the July meeting it was provided as follows  That a standing committee is hereby constituted under the name of the Com mittee on International Conference to consist of five members one to be sblected from each geographical section of the State whose duty it shall be generally to represent the Bar of this State in furthering the cause of friendly settlement of all international disputes This action was taken in response to a communication from the New York State Bar Association desiring our cooperation with a committee of that body appointed to devise and recommend a plan for the organization of a permanent international tribunal to which should be referred for peaceful settlement all controversies aris ing between Englishspeaking people The Bar Associations of most of the States have adopted similar measures The purpose is to keep this important matter before the country to create public and legal opinion in its favor and at the proper time to initiate such practical methods for giving it effect as may be deemed wise and expedient The President Hon W W Henry has recently announced this committee as follows From she Valley Capt Thomas D Ranson of Staunton from the Southwest Hon Rufus A Ayers of Big Stone Gap from Piedmont Prof W D Dabney 542 Nov1896 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES 543 of the University of Virginia from Tidewater Hon D Gardner Tyler of Stur geons Point and from the Southside Geo B Finch of Boydton These gentlemen desire through the REGISTER and by the courtesy of kindred Law publications in other States to invite correspondence with similar committees which may lead to concert of action by the profession in America in promo tion of this noble object IN THE CONFERENCEROOM OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES At a banquet tendered to Mr Justice Harlan on October 3 1896 by the bar of the city of Cincinnati Ohio in honor of his initial appearance in that city as the Justice of the Sixth Circuit under recent allotment the learned Justice responded to the toast The Supreme Court of the United States and its Work In the course of his remarks Justice Harlan gave the following interesting account of the mode in which the work of the court is distributed amongst the several judges and of the process by which final conclusions are reached and opinions moulded into shape for judicial utterance A sense of the care and labor thus bestowed tends to enhance our respect for that great court and to strengthen our faith in the justness and correctness of its decisions  In my intercourse with the members of the bar I have found to my great sur prise that the impression prevails with some that cases after being submitted are divided among the judges and that the court bases its judgment in each one wholly upon the report made by some one judge to whom that case has been assigned for examination and report I have met with lawyers who actually believed that the opinion was written before the case was decided in conference and that the only member of the court who fully examined the record and briefs was the one who prepared the opinion It is my duty to say that the business in our court is not conducted in any such mode Each Justice is furnished with a printed copy of the record and with a copy of each brief filed and each one examines the record and briefs at his chambers before the case is taken up for consideration The cases are thoroughly dsscussed in conferencethe discussion in some being necessarily more extended than in others The discussion being concludedand it is never concluded until each member of the court has said all that he desires to saythe roll is called and each Justice present and participating in the decision votes to affirm reverse or modify as his examination and reflection suggests The Chief Justice after the conference and without consulting his brethren distributes the cases so decided for opinions No Justice knows at the time he votes in a particular case that he will be asked to become the organ of the court in that case nor does any member of the court ask that a particular case be assigned to him The next step is the preparation of the opinion by the Justice to whom it has been assigned The opinion when prepared is privately printed and a copy placed in the hands of each member of the court for examination and criticism It is examined by each Justice and returned to the author with such criticisms and objections as are deemed necessary If these objections are of a serious kind affecting the general trend of the opinion the writer calls the attention of the Justices to them that they may be passed upon The author adopts such sugges tions of mere form as meet his views If objections are made to which the writerVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER does not agree they are considered in conference and are sustained or overruled as the majority may determine The opinion is reprinted so as to express the final conclusions of the court and is then filed Thus you will observe not only is the utmost care taken to make the opinion express the views of the court but that the final judgment rests in every case de cided upon the examination by each member of the court of the record and briefs Let me say that during my entire service in the Supreme Court I have not known a single instance in which the court has determined a case merely upon the report of one or more Justices as to what was contained in the record and as to what questions were properly presented by it When you find an opinion of the court on file and published the profession have the right to take it as expressing the deliberate views of the court based upon a careful examination of the records and briefs by each Justice participating in the judgment CONSTITUTIONAL LAWRight of State to confer citizenship Whatever view may once have been entertained on the subject there is no longer any doubt that the provision of the Constitution that Congress shall have power to establish a uni form rule of naturalization throughout the United States Art I sec 8 vests in Congress the exclusive power of admitting foreigners to citizenship in the con stitutional sense of that term A different conclusion was reached in Collet v Collet 2 Dall 294 where the concurrent right of the States was upheld but later decisions have settled the question in favor of the exclusive right of Congress Houston v Moore 5 Wheat 1 49 The License Cases 5 How 504 585 The Passen ger Cases 7 How 283 556 Cooleys Const Law 77 2 Story Const 1104 Indeed as argued by counsel in the Collet case it is difficult to conceive how the rules could be uniform if the States retained concurrent power over the subject There are other provisions of the Constitution however which leave to the States rights but little short of the full powers of naturalization viz  The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several States and the electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legis lature Art I sec II 1 and Each State shall appoint in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal to the whole num ber of senators and representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Con gress Art II sec I 2which electors cast the vote of the State for President and VicePresident as prescribed by the XIIth Amendment That is to say it is exclusively within the province of each State to prescribe the qualifications of those who are entitled to vote in that State for members of Congress and for presi dential electorssave in so far as the right may be affected by the provision of the XVth Amendment that no person shall be deprived of his right to vote by reason of race color or previous condition of servitude The Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage this is reserved exclusively to the States Minor v Happersetf 21 Wall 162 U S v Cruikshank 92 U S 542 One may be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of any State Dred Scott Case 19 How 393 The Slaughter House Cases 16 WVall 36 And so a State may confer full civil rights upon an alien including the right of suffrage but it cannot make him a citizen in the constitutional sense save in pursuance of the 544 Novnaturalization laws prescribed by Congress State v Cboe 17 Wis 674 City of Minneapolis v Reum 12 U S App 446 56 Fed Rep 576 6 C C A 31 As a consequence of these principles there results the singular anomaly that while the stability and operations of the Federal Government deeply concern every citizen he has no voice in the selection of those who are to administer its affairs except as his own State may give him that right And in the exercise of this power over the privilege of suffrage the State as we have seen may confer it upon aliens who have no interest whatever in the Federal Government It is not impossible therefore for the President of the United States and the entire Federal Congress to be elected by voters who are not citizens of the United States or of any State In many of the Western States this right to vote in Federal elections is freely exercised under the State laws by foreigners who have not been naturalized But such persons are neither citizens of the United States nor of the State by which such privileges are conferred See further on this subject 1 Hare Am Const Law 521529 Morse on Citizenship 143 Pomeroy Const Law 208210 The proposition last stated is well illustrated by the case of City of Minneapolis v Reum supra The plaintiff was a native of Saxony but had resided in Minne sota for twentyeight years and since early infancy Having declared his inten tion to become a citizen of the United States he was entitled under the laws of Minnesota to all the rights of citizenship But although he had enjoyed the benefits of this generous policy by voting at the latest congressional election having occasion shortly afterwards to sue the city of Minneapolis he found it to his interest to deny his citizenship and to institute his suit in the Federal court under the allegation that he was a subject of the King of Saxony There was nothing for the court to do but to entertain jurisdiction which it accordingly did on the grounds already stated In a valuable note to this case in 6 C C A 37 Mr H Campbell Black the editor has collected and discussed the authorities on this interesting question SUMMONING CORPORATIONS BY PUBLICATIONIt is believed that a general misunderstanding exists amongst the profession of this State as to the method of summoning corporations by publication This impression is derived from numer ous orders of publication which we have observed in the newspapers wherein the draughtsman has disregarded the plain directions of the statute under which ser vice by publication is authorized The error is due to a failure to observe that orders of publication against individual defendants and against corporations de fendant are governed by essentially distinct statutes Under the Virginia Code of 1873 individual defendants were summoned by orders of publication under Chap 166 sec 10 That is to say upon proper affi davit filed the clerk entered an order requiring the defendant to appear within a prescribed time after due publication of the order and do what was necessary to protect his interest Where a corporation was to be summoned by publication section 7 of the same chapter prescribed that publication of a copy of the pro cess or notice as an order is published under section 11 of this chapter shall together be sufficient This section 11 was devoted exclusively to the publication of sum mons issuing from the Court of Appeals the provision being that the clerk should issue the order on the first Monday in a month requiring the defendant to appear 1896 545 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES546 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Nov on a certain day designated in the order Section 14 of the same chapter directed that  every order of publication shall state briefly the object of the suit and re quire the defendants against whom it is entered   to appear within one month after due publication and do what is necessary to protect their interests So that while it is not altogether clear what is meant by the provision in the 7th sec tion with reference to corporations that  publication of a copy of the process or notice as an order is published under section 11 of this chapter shall together be sufficient  it is clear enough that the process or notice was itself to be published and not the mere order entered by the clerk Probably by the use of the word together it was intended that both the process in the suit and the order direct ing the publication should be published together At any rate the Code of 1873 draws a clear distinction between the method of summoning individuals by publication and that of summoning corporations Whatever else was necessary in such a proceeding against a corporation certainly the process in the suit must have been published But after this summons against the corporation was in proper shape for publication no further distinction was made between the corpora tion and the individual defendant and each became subject to the provisions of Chapter 166 regulating orders of publication generally that is to say the sum mons against the corporation whatever its form may have been was published and posted precisely as if the defendant had been an individual This longwinded preface brings us to the point which we desired to make viz that while sec 7 of Chap 166 prescribed what the form of the publication against corporations should be and required the process in the suit to be published the method of giving it requisite publicity was left to the general provisions of that chapter on the subject and was the same for individuals and corporations By the Code of 1887 a radical change was wrought Sec 3225 of the later Code representing sec 7 of Chap 166 of the former Code makes full provision not only for the form of the summons against corporations upon whom process cannot be served but for the method of publication as well and does not adopt as did the Code of 1873 the general method against individuals Sec 3225 of the Code of 1887 provides that where there is no agent etc upon whom service of process against or notice to a corporation can be made  publication of a copy of the process or notice once a week for four successive weeks in a newspa per printed in this State shall be a sufficient service of such process or notice  When the publication is of process it shall be made on an order directing the same in the case in which the process issues The order may be entered either in court or by the clerk in vacation It is to be observed that this section provides in detail 1 What is to be pub lishedviz the process in the suit and nothing else 2 How long it is to be pub lishedviz four weeks 3 Where it is to be publishedviz in a newspaper printed in this State 4 By whom the order to publish is issuedviz the court or clerk and 5 The effectviz it shall be a suffcient service of the process There is no need to look elsewhere for form or methods as there was under the old section in the Code of 1873 for which this section is a substitute sec 7 Chap 166 Now if we turn to section 3230 of the Code of 1887 and the three sections fol lowing we find elaborate provisions made for entering and publishing orders of publication generally the form and methods are given in detail These differ1896 MISCELLANEOUS NOtES 547 radically from the provisions of section 3225 quoted above These differences will be pointed out at length presently Clearly none of the provisions of these later sections applies to corporations The error to which we referred as common in the beginning of this discussion is in supposing that these provisions or some of them do apply to cbrporations But if they do what is the need of the pro visions of section 3225 just noticed If a plaintiff suing a foreign corporation should make the affidavit required by section 3225 should have process issued in the suit should obtain an order from the clerk to publish this process in a particular newspaper once a week for four we1 should publish that process and nothing else accordinglyomitting any publication of the order itself or tny post ing for the statute requires neither of thesewould not the defendant corpora tion be duly summoned The statute answers the question by providing that such method shall be sufficient So that when a plaintiff proceeds against a corporation and disregarding these provisions of section 3225 adopts the methods prescribed by sec 3230 and the following sections we have no difficulty in concluding that such service is invalid for all purposes Construing the two sections 3225 and 3230 together it is clear that section 3230 applies as exclusively to individuals as section 3225 does to corporations Otherwise we convict the revisors of the Code of 1887 of the absurdity of pre scribing two methods of summoning corporations by publication and but one in case of individuals The language of section 3230 itself indicates its obvious reference to individuals alone On affidavit says this section that a defend ant is not a resident of this State or that diligence has been used by or on behalf of the plaintiff to ascertain in what county or corporation he is without effect or that process directed to the officer of the county or corporation in which he resides or is has been twice delivered to such officer more than ten days before the return day and been returned without being executed or that the defendant in a suit for a divorce from the bond of matrimony is under sentence to confinement in the penitentiary an order of publication shall be entered against such defendant The next section 3231 directs that Every order of publication shall give the abbreviated style of the suit state briefly its object and require the defendants against whom it is entered    to appear within fifteen days after due pub lication thereof and do what is necessary to protect their interests It shall be published once a week for four successive weeks in such newspaper as the court may prescribe or if none be prescribed as the clerk may direct and shall be posted by the clerk at the front door of the courthouse of the county or corpora tion wherein the court is held on the first day of the next county or corporation court after it is entered Clearly none of these provisions is applicable to the publication of process against corporations under sec 3225 Process under sec 3225 does not  give the abbreviated style of the suit but the names of the plaintiffs and defendants in full nor does it state briefly its object but simply whether the suit is in debt assumpsit covenant etc or in chancery it does not require the defendant to appear within fifteen days after due publication but to any rule day within ninety days Hence none of these provisions of sec 3230 can be held to be applicable to the publication of process against corporations The following parallel columns will serve to contrast the difference in method and form in the two casesVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Against Oorporations 1 The process in the suit is alone pub lished 2 This process is in the ordinary form of a summons to commence a suit 3 The defendant is summoned to a cer tain rule day 4 The publication is to be made for four weeks in such newspaper printed in this State as the clerk or court may prescribe 5 No posting is requiredpublication in the newspaper  s sifficient Against Individuals 1 The order of publication is alone pub lished 2 This order must give the abbreviated style of the suit and state briefly its object 3 The defendant is ordered to appear within fifteen days after due publi cation of the order 4 The publication is to be made in such newspaper as the court or clerk may prescribe whether printed or pub lished in this State or not 5 The order must also be posted at the front door of the courthouse The following forms may serve to emphasize the contrast Summons by publication against a corporation The Commonwealth of Virginia To the Sergeant of the City of Lynchburg Greeting We command you that you summon the Central Loan  Trust Com pany of

in this suit and that this order be published and pbsted according to law Teste SAMUEL G WINGFIELD Jones  Smith Clerk p q Where there are both corporate and individual defendants there must of course be separate forms though both might be published together Service by publication being constructive service only the validity of judgments thereon by default is dependent upon strict compliance with the statute authorizing it See Galpin v Page 18 Wall 350 Earle v Mc Veigh 91 US 503 Settlemier v Sullivan 97 U S 444 548 Nov

CONSTRUCTION AND PROPERTIES OF A NEW QUADRA TRIX TO THE HYPERBOLA BY MR PERKS COM MUNICATED BY MR ABR DE MOIVRE F R S THE CIRCLE ELLIPSIS AND HYBERBOLA BEING NOT GEOME TRICALLY QUADRABLE AS INFINITE OTHERS THERE HAVE BEEN TWO WAYS MADE USE OF TO FIND THEIR AREAS 1 BY CONVERGING SERIES WHEREBY APPROACHES ARE MADE NEARER AND NEARER ACCORDING TO THE EXACTNESS DESIRD 2 BY QUADRATICES THAT IS MECHANICAL CURVES WHICH DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF CERTAIN LINES WHOSE SQUARES OR RECTANGLES GIVE THE AREA OF THE FIGURE DESIRD OF THIS SORT IS THE OLD QUADRATRIX OF DINOSTRATUS BY WHICH THE CIRCLE AND ELLIPSE ARE SQUARED AND ANOTHER SORT FOR THE SAME PUR POSE I INSERTED IN THE TRANSACTIONS ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO SINCE THAT HAVING FOUND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CURVE FROM WHENCE BESIDES ITS OWN QUADRATURE AND RECTIFICATION THE QUADRATURE OF THE HYPERBOLA IS DERIVD I THOUGHT THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT MIGHT NOT TO SOME BE UNACCEPTA BLE LET A B C D BE TWO STRAIGHT RULARS JOYNED AT B AND THERE MAKING A RIGHT ANGLE THEIR LENGTH ACCORDING TO THE LARGENESS OF THE FIGURE YOU WILL DESCRIBE E F IS ANO THER RULAR SOMEWHAT LONGER THAN A B NEAR THE ONE END E LET A LITTLE TRUCKLEWHEEL REPRESENTED EDGEWISE BY G H AND MADE OF A THIN PLATE OF BRASS OR IRON BE FASTNED TO THE RULAR BY A PIN I THOROW ITS CENTER SO THAT THE WHEEL MAY TURN ABOUT UPON THE PIN I TIGHT TO THE RULAR WITHOUT JOGGLING 13 X ON2254 ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THIS RULAR THE SIDE FROM THE EYE IN THE SCHEME LET THERE BE PINND OR GLEWED A LITTLE PIECE OF WOOD IN THE FORM OF A QUADRANT THE PART WHICH IS SEEN BEING MARKD K L WHOSE EDGE OR LIMB K L IS AN ARCH OF A CIRCLE OF CENTER I AND RADIUS I H THE SAME WITH THE LITTLE WHEEL THE DESIGN OF THIS PIECE OF WOOD IS THAT IN THE SEVERAL POSITIONS OF THE RULAR E F THE CIRCULAR LIMB K L ALWAYS TOUCHING AND SLIDING BY THE EDGE OF THE RULAR A B THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL MAY BE ALWAYS IN A LINE I M PARALLEL TO THE RULAR A B IN THE RULAR C D MAKE M B  I H OR I K AND AT M FASTEN A LITTLE PIN AND ANOTHER TO THE RULAR E F NEAR THE WHEEL AS AT P TO THESE TWO PINS LET BE FASTNED THE TWO ENDS OF A STRING M R SO THAT ITS WHOLE LENGTH FROM PIN TO PIN  P I BE EQUAL TO THE INTENDED AXIS OF THE CURVE T W THE INSTRUMENT BEING THUS PREPARD LET A STRONG RULAR S O BE FASTNED OR HELD FAST UPON THE PAPER OR PLAIN THAT THE CURVE IS TO BE DRAWN UPON LAY THE RULAR E F FROM M TOWARDS A AND PARALLEL TO A B SO THAT THE STRING LYE ALL STRAIGHT ALONG THE EDGE OF THE RULAR E F FROM M TO P THE POINT S K OF THE QUADRANTAL PIECE OF WOOD RESTING UP ON THE EDGE OF THE RULAR A B THEN WITH A SMALL PIN AT M KEEPING THE STRING CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE RULAR E F AND WITH YOUR OTHER HAND UPON THE END E KEEPING THE WHEEL TIGHT TO THE PAPER OR PLAIN MOVE THE PIN STRING AND RULAR E F FROM M TOWARDS O THE RULAR C D SLIDING ALONG BY THE FASTNED RULAR S O IN A RIGHT LINE THE WHEEL G H WILL BY ITS MOTION DESCRIBE THE DESIRED CURVE T V NOTE2255 NOTE THE SEMIDIAMETER OF THE LITTLE WHEEL MUST BE ABOUT THE SUM OF THE THICKNESSES OF THE TWO RULARS E F AND A B THAT IT MAY TOUCH THE PAPER ALSO IT WILL BE CONVENIENT THAT ITS EDGE BE THIN AND A LITTLE ROUGH THAT IT MAY NOT SLIDE FLATWAYS AND THAT IT MAY LEAVE A VISIBLE IMPRESSION FROM THIS CONSTRUCTION THE FOLLOWING PROPERTIES ARE DEMONSTRABLE I IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE CONSTRUCTION THAT THE SUM OF THE TANGENT AND SUBTANGENT IS EVERY WHERE EQUAL TO THE SAME GIVEN LINE  M R  R I  T W FOR THE STRING FIRST STRAIGHT AT T W AFTERWARDS MAKING AN ANGLE AT R BEING EVERY WHERE THE SAME THE LINE R I OR R P  P I IS ALWAYS THE TANGENT AND THE REMAINDER R M THE SUBTANGENT THE CONTACT OF THE WHEEL WITH THE PLAIN BEING THE POINT OF THE CURVE TO WHICH THEY BE LONG II IT HENCE FOLLOWS THAT ANY AFFIGNABLE PART OF THE CURVE IS RECTIFIABLE OR EQUAL TO ANY ASSIGNABLE STRAIGHT LINE

PROPERTIES OF THIS CURVE AND HAD GIVEN SOME ACCOUNT OF THEM TO MY INGENIOUS FRIEND MR JOHN COLSON HE RETURNED ME A LETTER WITH THE ADDITION OF THE QUADRATURE OF THE CURVES AREA WHICH I HAD NOT THEN ENQUIRED INTO V SUPPOSING STILL THE SAME THINGS I SAY THAT THE SOLID MADE BY THE CONVERSION OF THE AREA F A B H F ABOUT THE LINE H B AS AN AXIS IS EQUAL TO A CYLINDER WHOSE RADIUS IS F H  A AND HEIGHT

MAY THE LOGARITHMICK CURVE BE CONSTRUCTED WHICH IS ALSO A QUADRATRIX TO THE HYPERBOLA IN FIG 1 OMITTING THE STRING M R P LET THE DISTANCE M R BE EQUAL TO THE SUBTAN GENT OF THE INTENDED LOGARITHMICK CURVE WHICH AS TIS KNOWN IS INVARIABLE STICK A PIN AT R IN THE RULAR C D TO WHICH APPLY THE RULAR E F SO THAT THE EDGE OF THE LIT TLE QUADRANK K L RESTING UPON THE RULAR A B THE DISTANCE M I BE EQUAL

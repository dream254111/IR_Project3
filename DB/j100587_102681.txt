Construction and Properties of a new Quadra trix to the Hyperbola By Mr Perks Com municated by Mr Abr de Moivre F R S THe Circle Ellipsis and Hyberbola being not Geome trically Quadrable as infinite others there have been two ways made use of to find their Areas 1 By Converging Series whereby Approaches are made nearer and nearer according to the exactness desird 2 By Quadratices that is Mechanical Curves which determine the Length of certain Lines whose Squares or Rectangles give the Area of the Figure desird Of this sort is the old Quadratrix of Dinostratus by which the Circle and Ellipse are squared and another sort for the same pur pose I inserted in the Transactions about 5 years ago Since that having found the Construction of a Curve from whence besides its own Quadrature and Rectification the Quadrature of the Hyperbola is derivd I thought the following Account might not to some be unaccepta ble Let A B C D be two straight Rulars joyned at B and there making a right Angle Their length according to the largeness of the Figure you will describe E F is ano ther Rular somewhat longer than A B Near the one end E let a little Trucklewheel represented edgewise by g h and made of a thin Plate of Brass or Iron be fastned to the Rular by a Pin i thorow its Center so that the Wheel may turn about upon the Pin i tight to the Rular without joggling 13 X On2254 On the under side of this Rular the side from the Eye in the Scheme let there be pinnd or glewed a little piece of Wood in the form of a Quadrant the part which is seen being markd k l whose edge or limb k l is an arch of a Circle of Center i and Radius i h the same with the little Wheel The design of this piece of Wood is that in the several Positions of the Rular E F the circular Limb k l always touching and sliding by the edge of the Rular A B the Center of the Wheel may be always in a line i m parallel to the Rular A B In the Rular C D make M B  i h or i k and at M fasten a little Pin and another to the Rular E F near the Wheel as at p To these two Pins let be fastned the two ends of a String M R so that its whole length from Pin to Pin  p i be equal to the intended Axis of the Curve T W The Instrument being thus prepard let a strong Rular S O be fastned or held fast upon the Paper or Plain that the Curve is to be drawn upon Lay the Rular E F from M towards A and parallel to A B so that the String lye all straight along the edge of the Rular E F from M to p the point S k of the Quadrantal piece of Wood resting up on the edge of the Rular A B Then with a small Pin at M keeping the String close to the edge of the Rular E F and with your other hand upon the end E keeping the Wheel tight to the Paper or Plain move the Pin String and Rular E F from M towards O the Rular C D sliding along by the fastned Rular S O in a right line the Wheel g h will by its motion describe the desired Curve T V Note2255 Note The Semidiameter of the little Wheel must be about the Sum of the thicknesses of the two Rulars E F and A B that it may touch the Paper Also it will be convenient that its edge be thin and a little rough that it may not slide flatways and that it may leave a visible impression From this Construction the following Properties are demonstrable I It is evident from the Construction that the Sum of the Tangent and Subtangent is every where equal to the same given Line  M R  R i  T W for the String first straight at T W afterwards making an Angle at R being every where the same the Line R i or R p  p i is always the Tangent and the Remainder R M the Subtangent the Contact of the Wheel with the Plain being the point of the Curve to which they be long II It hence follows that any affignable part of the Curve is Rectifiable or equal to any assignable straight Line In Fig 2 Let F A E be a part of the Curve its Vertex F H D d is the Line described by the motion of the Pin R in Fig 1 and may be shewn to the As symptote to the Curve F H a perpendicular to H D Let A be given point in the Curve A D the Tangent and B D the Subtangent to the same point A Let a be another point in the Curve infinitely near to A to which let a d be the Tangent and b d the Subtangent Draw A G a g perpendicular to F H and A B a b perpendicu lar to H D By the Construction A D  D B  a d  d b Let a  be made equal to a D and draw D  then because a d  b d  A D  D B Subtract b D and a D or a  from both Sums Equals from Equals there remains  d  d D  A a  B b or C a A a C 13 X 2 D2256 D d  are like Triangles or differing infinitely little from such therefore C a B b A a  d D d and com pounding B b  A a A a  d  D d D d Alter nating B b  A a  d  D d A a D d But B b  A a   d  D d as is shewn above therefore A a  D d A a is the fluxional Particle of the Curve F A and D d is the fluxional Particle of the Line H D These Fluxions or Augments being equal and their flowing quantities beginning together are themselves therefore equal viz F A  H D Let F G  x G A  H B  y A D  t B D  S So is the Curve F A  H D  y  S that is the Curve from the Vertex to any given point therein is equal to the Sum of its Ordinate and Subtangent to the same point which is its second Property III The next Property and whereupon I call it the Hyperbolic Quadratrix is this In Fig 2 let F A E be a part of the Curve c as before F I K H is a Square upon the line F H  I L is an Equilater Hyperbola whose Vertex is I its Asymptotes H O H R its Ax H I  From a given point L in the Hyperbola below its Vertex I draw L A parallel to the Asymptote R H intersecting the Diagonal I H in M F H in G and touching the Qua dratrix in A I say that the Hyperbolic Area I L M is equal to a Rectangle whose sides are the Ordinate G A and twice F H the Ax to the Quadratrix that is Trilin I L M  2 F H  G A Let F H  a F G  x G A  y because of the Hyperbola G L X G H L S  F   therefore G L  F H qG H and L M  F H qG H   H M G that is L M  a aax a  x  2 a x  xx and consequently the fluxion of the Area I L  In2257 In the Rectangle triangle A D B A B  a  x B D  S A D  t  a  S then is A D q  A B q  B D q or a a 2 a S  SS  a a  2 a x  x x  S S which being reduced gives S  2 a x  xx2 a Let l a be a right line supposed infinitely near and pa rallel to L A and interfecting A B in C Because of like triangles A C a A B D A B B D A C C a that is a  x S  2 a x  x x2 a x y therefore y  2 a x  x x2 a a   a x x Multiply each by 2 a and tis 2 a y 2 a x  x xa  x x The Flowing quantity of  a y is 2 a y and the flowing quantity of 2 a x  x xa  x is theHyperbolic Area I L M as is shewn before These two Areas be ginning together at F and I and having every where equal Fluxionsor Augments are therefore themselves every where equal N The Quadrature of the Trilinear Figure I L M being thus found any other Area bounded with the Curve line I L and any other Right Lines is also given IV Supposing the same things as in the precedent Pro position I say that the Area of the Quadratrix F a b H F is equal to half the square of F g wanting the Cube of F g divided by six F H or F a b H F  x xx  x x x6 a The Fluxion of this Area is the Rectangle C a b B  a  x  y  a  x x 2 a x  x x2 a a  a x x  x x  x x2 a x The flowing quantity of x x is   x And the flowing quan tity2258 tity of  x x2 a  is  x x x6 a as is easily shewn by bring ing back these slowing quantities to their respective Fluxi ous And hence also it follows that the whole Area continued on infinitely towards E is one third of the Square F I K H or 13 a a Eor supposing x  a the Area above becomes a a2  a a6  a a3 While I was considering the other Properties of this Curve and had given some account of them to my Ingenious Friend Mr John Colson he returned me a Letter with the Addition of the Quadrature of the Curves Area which I had not then enquired into V Supposing still the same things I say that the Solid made by the conversion of the Area F a b H F about the Line H b as an Axis is equal to a Cylinder whose Radius is F H  a and height equal to x x2 a  x32 a a  8 x4a3 And the whole Solid made by conversiou of the whole Figure infinitely continued is equal to an eighth part of a Cylinder whose Radius and Height are each equal to F H or a Let PD express the Proportion of the Periforie and Diameter of a Circle Then is PD a b quad the Area of a Circle whose Radius Is a b And because C a  y  x  x x2 axa  the fluxion of the Solid is PD a b q x x  x x2 a x or2259 or PDa  x 2 x x  x x2 a xa  x  PDa x  32xx2 ax x whose flowing quantity is PD a x x  x x x2  x48 a Which Solid being divided by PD a a the Area of a Circle whose Radius is a gives x x 2 a  x x x2 a a  x48 a a for the heightof a Cylinder on the said circular Base and equal to the Solid made by conversion of the Area F a b H F about the Line H b as an Axis When x  a that is when the whole Figure is turnd about its A symptote the height x x2 a  x32 a a  x48 a a become 1 a VI The Curve surface of the Solid generated by the Conversion of the Figure F a b H F about H B is equal to the Curve surface of a Cylinder whose Radius is a and height equal to x x x2 4 a  x x x1 2 a a And the whole Curve Surface of the Solid insinitely continued is equal to one third part of the Curve Surface of a Cylinder whose Radius and Height are equal to F H or a Which may be demon strated after the manner of the precedent Proposition VII The Radius of the Curvature of any Particle of the Quadratrix is t ta  x and this found Geometrically In Fig 3 F A E is the Quadratrix H D the Asymptote A D the Tangent B D the Subtangent to a given point A Make B V  A D Upon V rise the perpendicular V W from A draw A W perpendicular to the Tangent A D till it2260 it meet A W in W So is A W the Radius of the Curva ture at A VIII This Curve may be continued on infinitely above the point F but by a different and more operose way of Construction whose Properties will be these 1 The Difference of its Tangent and Subtangent taking the Subtangent in the Line H S will be always equal to the same given Line F H or a That is as t  s  a below F so t  s  a above F 2 As below F the Curve Line is equal to the Sum of its Ordinate and Subtangent so a bove it is equal to their Difference or  Sy 3 As below F 2 a y  I L M so above 2 a y  I   All which and its other Properties may be demonstrated as the Pre cedent mutatis mutandis IX With a little variation in the precedentConstruction may the Logarithmick Curve be constructed which is also a Quadratrix to the Hyperbola In Fig 1 omitting the String M R P let the distance M R be equal to the Subtan gent of the intended Logarithmick Curve which as tis known is invariable Stick a Pin at R in the Rular C D to which apply the Rular E F so that the edge of the lit tle Quadrank k l resting upon the Rular A B the distance M i be equal to M R Then keeping the Rular E F tight to the Pin R and Rular A B slide the Rular C D along in a straight Line by the Rular or Line S O So will the Wheel g h describe a part of the Logarithmick Curve T V whose Subtangent is every where M R X Fig 2 Let F A E represent the Logarithmick Curve whose Subtangent is equal to F H L I  is an Equilater Hyperbola c as before  III Let F G  x G a  y F H  B D  a G H  L S  a  x A C  x C a  y Then A C C a A B B D that is x y a  x2261 x a a a aax therefore a y  a aax x The Flowing quantity of a y is a y and the Flowing quantity of a aax x is the Hyperbolick Area F I L G for by the nature of the Hyperbola G L  a aax therefore is the Hyperbolick Area F I L G equal to a y a Rectangle whose sides are the Subtangent B D  F H and Ordinate G A as here accounted

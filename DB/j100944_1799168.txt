these occasions to offer any general observations except such as may be connected with the Paers immediately in hand otherwise I should have felt it my duty to exlress my thanks to you at greater length than I shall now do because I am most anxious to preserve intact the ancient practices of this Society I should have felt it my duty to express my warmest thanks to the Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society for placing me in this Chair But I apprehend a more fitting opportunity for so doing will be aflorded me on a future occasion of which I shall most gladly avail myself It will therefore be hardly necessary that I should detain yon a minute frorn listening to the Papers which will he read on that most interesting expedition the exploration of Central Africa by Captains Burton and Speke Their steps during that arduous undertaking have been watched with interest by every person in tllis country attached to geographical science and every Fellow of this Society is aware of the importance of the inquiries which they went out to institute What we shall hear from them will ive us an idea of the difficulties disasters and privations they endured and I think we shall be able to draw from their narratives thouah they will not dwell on it themselves with how much syirit courate English pluck and enterprise they overcame those difficulties Captain Speke who penetrated in a diSerent direction somewhat farther than Captairl Burton who was prevented by illness from following him is decidedly of opinion that he has established the point whence the Nile takes its rise VOL III 2 n348 EXPLORATIONS IN EASTERN AFRICX JUNE 13 1859 You will hear what he has to say on this subject and no doubt there will be some discussion upon it afterwards but I feel quite convinced that whatever diffelersces of opinion may arise on that particular point though I think the ar Juments which Captain Speke adduces are of very great weight and import ance every one who hears the accounts tonight will feel that most valuable and important information has been obtained  information not only important il a geoCraphical point csf view but valuable also as havina no small bearing on commercial and industrial questions I think we should never lose sight of the importance which the labotlrs of this Society possess in respect of the industry manufactures and commerce of this country I will not detain you any lorler from the extremely interesting narrative of Captain Burton who will now proceed to read lliS Paper The Papers read were Explorations zn Eastern Africa By CAPTAINS R F BURTON FRGS and J H SPESE FRGS 1 CAPrAIN BUETON late Commandant of the East African Expedition read out a general account of his proceedings subsequent to the tentative journey to Fuga and Usumbara which appeared in the 28th Vol of the Journal of the SocietJr The Paper contained a description of the personnel of the East African Expedition vvhen leaving the coast for the purpose of exploring the iSea of Ujiji The difficulties of departure and the severe trials of patience on the road were then dwelt upon At length however the travellers reached Unyanyembe the capital of the  Land of the ZIoon and experienced from the kindhearted Arabs the warmest welcome for which however they were not a little indebted to the introductory firman furnished by HH Sayyid Majid Sultan of Zanzibar and the Sawahil Captain Burton then brieflr described the trying and dangerous Inarch during the rainy lnonsoon from Unyanyembe to Ujiji upon the Tanganyika Lake and his exploration in company with Saptain Speke of the northern waters of that sweet sea which saw for the first time the union jack floating over its dark bosom AVant of supplies prevented the travellers penetrating farther into the interior and concluding the Periplus of the Lake they reluctantly bade adieu to Ujiji and on the l9th of June 1358 reentered Unyanyembe After about six weeks during which Captain Speke having tra versed the unexplored length of Usukuma laid down the southern limit of the Nt7anza or Ukerewe Lake which had been heard of from the Arabs of Unyanyenlbe the expedition marched eastward intending to make the coast vaa Kilwa Again however they were doomed to disappointment The African Pagazi or porters could not be persuaded to deviate from their normal line The explorels

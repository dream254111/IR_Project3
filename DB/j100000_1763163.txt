cordial support which they have given to the Hydrographic Office in its efforts to collect and publish early and accurate infor mation by means of which this danger to navigation may be dimin ished The various commercial nations should unite in the effort to keep the seas clear of such obstructions and it is a subject that may well be discussed by the forthcoming International Maritime Conference HEALTH MATTERS TYPHOID STATISTICS  Professor Ruata of Perugia is author ity for the statement that there are annually in Italy nearly 300000 cases of typhoidfever of which number 27000 prove fatal One third of the persons in Italy who reach the age of fortyfive have the fever and in some districts more than three per cent of the population die from this one cause ARSENIC IN FABRICS The Londonz Czemzical News states that Mr A W Stokes has examined a hundred samples of imita tion Indian muslins and cretonnes and found that twentythree per cent contained arsenic in appreciable quantities the highest pro portion 21 grains of white arsenic per square yard The colors in which arsenic was principally present were the terracotta reds and the greenishbrowns Of the wallpapers submitted to Mr Stokes by various manufacturers ten per cent were found to contain arse nic Thirty other articles of household use such as plushes vel vets carpets mats silks etc were examined and in only one sample  a little flax mat of green color  was arsenic found BACTERIA IN THE GLACIERS  Dr Schmelk of Christiania Cenlralbldatfur lBacleriologie has found vast colonies of bacteria in the ice of the Jerstedalsbrae glacier and in the streams fed by it They appear under the form of rods and resemble the Bacillus fluorescens liquefaciens During their period of growth these bacteria emit a fluorescent material They multiply with great rapidity during periods of thaw A NEW DEODORANT Bromine has for a long time been recognized hs being valuable in the treatment of gangrene and foul smelling ulcers but until recently its merits as an effectual and cheap deodorant have not been appreciated according to the New York Medical Journal It was brought into prominence a few months ago by Mr Martin the chemist of the health department of this city who suggested its use upon the earth thrown up in lay ing the electric subways As it is a byproduct obtained in the manufacture of salt and is not used extensively in the arts it is sold at a very reasonable price  about seventy cents per pound It has the property of precipitating the hydrocarbons of illuminat inggas and thus can be used to deodorize the earth exposed in excavations in the vicinity of gasmains More valuable than this is its effect upon decomposingorganic bodies which it renders completely inoffensive This property renders it particularly valu able for use in stables privyvaults urinals cesspools or in any tplace which may contain foulsmelling organic matters It is soluble in about thirtythree parts of water but a solution of this strength is not advisable as there is a constant escape from it of the vapor of bromine which is very irritating to the eyes and airpas sages and which may even attack wood and metals For ordinary purposes it is used in solutions containing one part by weight to about eight hundred of water In this strength it may be used freely without its affecting any thing which it may touch A few gallons used daily will remove all ammoniacal odors from stables or a few quarts will thoroughly deodorize the entire plumbing sys tem of an ordinary house It also might be used with advantage upon ordinary housegarbage which usually becomes offensive so speedily in warm weather There would appear to be scarcely any limit to its usefulness in this branch of sanitary science and it will as soon as its merits are better known undoubtedly be adopted universally as a substitute for the deodorants now in use which usually act by substituting one unpleasant odor for another The only drawback in its use lies in the fact that the undiluted bromine is strongly corrosive and if it touches the skin causes a painful iI9 burn Where it is used in large quantities this can be obviated by opening the bottle or what is simpler breaking it under water As its use becomes more extended it will undoubtedly be put up in pearls or tubes containing only as much as would be needed at one time in the average household TRANSMISSION OF DIPHTHERIADr De la Roche believes that diphtheria can be transmitted from animals to man He has had under his care two women suffering from diphtheria which he thinks he has traced to the contamination of drinkingwater from a cistern by the excrement of pigeons which had been washed down by the rain from the roof on which these birds had perched Ad mitting the possibility of the transmission of diphtheria in this manner the means of combating it are simple In places where springwater and wellwater are not available or where the supply consists of rainwater collected in cisterns it is well to limit pigeon breeding and to construct dovecotes as far away as possible from dwellinghouses As to the construction of cisterns they should be built according to the rules of public hygiene laid down by Gania in his work entitled  Utilite des Citernes MALARIADr Henry B Baker the wellknown sanitarian contributed a paper at the last meeting of the American Medical Association on  Malaria and the Causation of Periodic Fever After an able discussion of the subject he sums up as follows So far as evidence is yet presented it seems to be proved then that i intermittent fever is proportional directly or inversely to the average daily range of atmospheric temperature 2 the con trolling cause of intermittent fever is exposure to insidious changes or changes to which one is unaccustomed in the atmospheric temperature 3 in the mechanism of the causation of intermittent fever the chief factor is the delay in the reaction from exposure to cool air this delay extending to a time when greater heatloss should occur results in the abnormal accumulation of heat in the interior of the body and in disturbed nervous action  the chill and the final reaction is excessive because of the accumulation of heat and sometimes because it occurs at the warmest part of the day 4 the fever is the excessive reaction from the insidious in fluence of the exposure to cool air and it is periodical because of the periodicity of nervous action and because the exposure and the consequent chill are periodical owing to the nightly absence of the warmth from the sun 5 residence in valleys or on low lands through which or upon which cold air flows at night and thus causes insidious changes in the atmospheric temperature favors intermittent fever 6 in our climate those measures such as drainage which enable the soil to retain warmth during the night and thus reduce the daily range of temperature immediately over such soil tend to decrease intermittent fever among residents there on 7 in the cure and prophylaxis of intermittent fever those remedies are useful which lessen torpidity and tend to increase the power of the body to react promptly to insidious changes in at mospheric temperature 8 the slowness of the pulse and other indications of torpidity associated with retention of bile or with certain disturbances of the functions of the liver are well known but so far as known to the writer these conditions have not here tofore been considered as causative of the fever in the manner herein suggested SCIENTIFIC NEWS IN WASHINGTON RockGas and Related Bitumens  A Diagram of the Worlds War Vessels  The Eastern Cherokees Some lHabits of Koreans RockGas and Related Bitumens IN a communication the second on the list presented before the Philosophical Society on Feb 2 Mr W J McGee pointed out that p5arfiassu with the industrial development accompanying the utili zation of rockgas geologic science has made an unparalleled stride within a few months When exploitation for gas began in Ohio in I886 the geologist found himself utterly unable either to guide the efforts of the prospector or to predict the results of his work yet within the ensuing two years the laws governing the accumulation and distribution of gas and oil have been so fully developed that the rockgas problem to day claims a solution as satisfactory as FEBRUARY 15 1889

INTEREST WAS FOUND TO BE IN PLOT YET AS THE PUPIL GREW OLDER THERE WAS LESS INTEREST IN PLOT AND MORE IN CHARACTER THE INTEREST IN MORAL WAS SLIGHT IN THE EIGHTH GRADE BECOMING MARKED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL INTEREST IN STYLE ROSE FROM 8 PER CENT IN THE EIGHTH GRADE TO 20 PER CENT IN THE THIRD YEAR CURRENT FICTION PREFERRED IN THE FIRST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL GAVE PLACE TO CLASSIC FICTION IN THE THIRD YEAR THE ESSAY AND POETRY APPEARED TO EXCITE LITTLE INTEREST EXCEPT WITH A STORY THE INVESTIGATION WHICH PRODUCED THE CHICAGO COURSE OF STUDY IN ENGLISH WHICH SEPARATES

LITERATURETHE ORAL READING OF LITERATURE THE STUDY OF VERSE HE TREATED THE SUBJECT UNDER THE HEADINGS WHO IS TO DO THE READING HOW IS IT TO BE DONE AND HOW TREATED THE FASHION OF THE DAY IS FOR ORAL EXPRESSION LITTLE FAULT IS FOUND WITH METHOD BUT COMPLAINTS ARE HEARD OF INADEQUATE TRAINING IN READING THERE IS TOO MUCH NOTETAKING GREAT LITERATURE CAN BEST BE PRESENTED ORALLY WRITTEN WORDS ARE DEAD SYMBOLS LITERATURE IS AN ART NOT A SCIENCE AND MUST BE TREATED THROUGH THE VOICE THE TEACHER MUST BE ABLE TO INTERPRET THETHE SCHOOL REVIEW PRINTED PAGE PUPILS ALSO MUST READ BUT SHOULD NOT BE ASKED TO READ AT SIGHT THE READING SHOULD BE DONE IN A SIMPLE NATURAL MANNER THIS DOES NOT REFER TO THE LITERATURE OF FACT THAT WHICH WE READ MERELY FOR INFORMATION DRAMATIZATION IS UNNECESSARY LIKELY TO BE A HODGEPODGE AND TAKES TOO MUCH TIME STUDENTS CAN DO THEIR OWN DRAMATIZATION MENTALLY EMOTIONALLY WHY DRAMATIZE THE PROLOGUE TO THE CANTERBURY TALES MATERIAL ON THE STUDY OF VERSE MAY BE FOUND

FACTORS WHICH CONDITION LEARNING AND TEACHING 4 TO FURNISH DATA THAT WILL MAKE POSSIBLE COMPARISON OF SCHOOL WITH SCHOOL OF TEACHER WITH TEACHER SUCH A TEST WOULD BE OF VALUE IN ENABLING TEACHERS TO TREAT THE INDIVIDUAL MORE INTELLIGENTLY IT IS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING IN CONNECTION WITH DETERMINING WHAT A PUPIL SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO AT VARIOUS STAGES OF HIS PROGRESS MISS FISH IN AN ARTICLE ON WHAT PUPILS SHOULD KNOW WHEN THEY ENTER HIGH SCHOOL SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE THE HABIT OF READING INTELLIGENTLY AND OF EXPRESSING THEIR IDEAS IN CLEAR AND GRAM MATICAL SENTENCES LESS TIME SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ELEMENTARY RHETORIC AND MORE TO INTELLIGENT READING AND CLEAR EXPRESSION THE TRAINING OF PUPILS TO THINK SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE COLLEGE ACCORDING TO FRANK AYDELOTTE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT WHAT THEY CAN LEARN THIS VIEW IS NOT ACCEPTED BY DUDLEY MILES HE SAYS PUPILS CAN BE LED INTO A REFLECTIVE ATTITUDE AND CAN BE TAUGHT TO REJECT SNAP JUDGMENTS ANOTHER

SECRETARY A COLEMAN UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO ATTENDANCE 75 THE CONFERENCE OF THE FRENCH SECTION WAS DEVOTED LARGELY TO A CONSIDERA TION OF METHOD THE MOST CONSIDERABLE CONTRIBUTOR WAS MR ARTHUR BOVEE OF THE UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL IN A PAPER ON CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE DIRECT METHOD AND IN A SPECIMEN LESSON IN WHICH HE SHOWED WHAT A HIGHSCHOOL CLASS CAN BE MADE TO DO AFTER TWENTYFOUR WEEKS OF SUCH TRAINING MR BOVEES CHIEF CONTENTION WAS THAT IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE PUPIL UNDERSTAND THE FOREIGN TONGUE DIRECTLY AND HE LAID MUCH STRESS ON THE MEANS BY WHICH THE TEACHER MAY ARRIVE AT THIS CHIEF OF THESE ARE PUTTING THE WORDS AND EVEN THE CONCEPTS INTO ACTION AND THE FREE USE OF CONTRAST AND NEGATION BUILDING UP FROM THE KNOWN TO THE UNKNOWN BUT THE TEACHER NEED NOT STOP HERE TO BEAR THIS OUT MR BOVEE DISTRIBUTED AN OUTLINE OF THE GRAMMATICAL WORK HIS CLASS HAD COVERED BY MEANS OF SYSTEMATIZED EXERCISES THE USE OF THE ARTICLE AND PARTITIVE CONSTRUCTION PRONOUNS AND ADJECTIVES THE

IN HIS BOOK PRESENTS A SERIES OF CAREFULLY DEVISED EXERCISES FOR TRANSLATION AND COMPOSITION IN WHICH VOCABULARY AND GRAMMATICAL PRINCIPLES ARE DRIVEN HOME BY CONSTANT REPETITION AND REWORKING OF THE

FOR DECEMBER I913 MR TRYON OF THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION SUMMARIZED THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE HAS A STRONG SOCIOLOGICAL BIAS AS IS INDICATED IN 474TWENTYSIXTH CONFERENCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS 475 ITS NAME PURPOSE AND IN THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH REPRE SENTATIVE IN A PROFESSIONAL SENSE THE COMMITTEE IS NOT SO GEOGRAPHICALLY AS A CLEAR MAJORITY ARE FROM THE NORTH ATLANTIC STATES IN THE FIVEYEAR COURSE OUTLINED BY THE COMMITTEE THE FIRST YEAR IS TO BE DEVOTED TO COMMUNITY CIVICS AND TO A SURVEY OF VOCATIONS AND THE LAST YEAR TO ECONOMICS AND TO CIVIC THEORY AND PRACTICE OUT OF FIVE UNITS THE COMMITTEE DEVOTES THREE TO HISTORY THIS IS TO BE SOCIALIZED THE AIM BEING THE CULTIVATION OF A SPIRIT OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP TOWARD THIS END IT IS TO BE STUDIED TOPICALLY RATHER THAN CHRONOLOGICALLY AND THE PAST IS TO BE SUBORDINATED TO THE PRESENT THUS THE FIRST UNIT IS TO COVER THE WHOLE OF RECORDED HISTORY TO THE YEAR I700 AD THE SECOND UNIT IS MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORY FROM I700 AD AND THE THIRD AMERICAN HISTORY IN EACH OF THESE LATTER COURSES AGAIN THE EMPHASIS IS ON PRESENTDAY CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS THE REPORT WAS DISCUSSED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE UNIVERSITY BY PROFESSOR MCLAUGHLIN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HE REFERRED TO HIS DIFFIDENCE IN CRITICIZING THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AS HIS EXPERIENCE ON SUCH COMMITTEES HAD GIVEN HIM A KEEN SENSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK AND HAD POSSIBLY FIXED HIS VIEWPOINT HE STATED THAT HE AGREED WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT THE TIME FOR DICTATING FOR THE HIGH SCHOOLS IS PAST THE COURSE SHOULD BE ARRANGED TO DEVELOP BOYS AND GIRLS THE EMPHASIS ON MODERN HISTORY IS INEVITABLE THE TIME RE DUCTION MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO COVER THE WHOLE FIELD OF HISTORY MUST ANCIENT HISTORY BE ELIMINATED WHATEVER PLAN OF EXCISION BE ADOPTED QUALITY AND NOT QUANTITY OF INFORMATION SHOULD BE THE AIM THE INTEREST AND ENTHUSIASM OF THE STUDENT MUST BE AROUSED AND A LOVE OF READING AND THE KNACK OF FINDING THINGS IN BOOKS CULTIVATED ABOVE ALL THE AIM SHOULD BE ALWAYS THE CULTIVATION OF THE ATTITUDE OF HISTORICALMINDEDNESS THE SPEAKER WARNED OF THE DANGER IN CONSTANTLY UNSETTLING THE CURRICULUM THE PRESENT NECESSITY IS NOT IN DETERMINING ORDER OF STUDIES BUT LEARNING HOW TO TEACH AS GREAT DANGER EXISTS IN THE OVEREMPHASIS ON THE STUDY OF PRESENT CONDITIONS THE VALUE OF CULTURE OF WHAT IS PERMANENT IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE PAST CANNOT BE MINI MIZED THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF HISTORY MUST NOT BE SUBORDINATED TO KNOWLEDGE OF PASSING THINGS THE REPORT WAS CONSIDERED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE HIGH SCHOOL BY MR BOBBITT OF THE OAK PARK HIGH SCHOOL FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE WITH SUCH A COURSE HE CRITICIZED THE COMMUNITY CIVICS OF THE FIRST YEAR ON THE GROUND THAT THE SUBJECT WAS COVERED IN THE GRADES HE MADE NO OBJECTION TO THE HISTORY COURSES AS OUTLINED BUT RAISED A WARNING AGAINST DISTORTING HISTORY TO SUIT THE VIEWS OF ANY GROUP THE COURSES LAID DOWN FOR THE FIFTH YEAR WERE CRITICIZED ECONOMICS IS TOO THEORETICAL AND ABSTRACT FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL A SUBSTITUTE MIGHT BE FOUND IN INDUSTRIAL HISTORY THE COURSE IN CIVIC THEORY IS TOO ADVANCED IN ITS NATURE AND THE BOOKS RECOMMENDED ARE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE HIGHSCHOOL PUPIL THE DISCUSSION WAS OPENED BY MR HUTH OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HE LOOKED UPON THE REPORT AS PROCEEDING FROM A DESIRE TO INTRODUCE NEWTHE SCHOOL REVIEW SUBJECTS AND EXPEL OLD SUBJECTSAS ALMOST SOCIALISTIC IN ITS TRE NDAND SPIRIT THE FIRST UNIT OF HISTORY IS FRANKLY IMPOSSIBLE THE KNOWLEDGE THE HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATE HAS OF HISTORY IS ALREADY TOO VAGUE WHAT IS NEEDED IS NOT A CHANGE OF PERSPECTIVE IN HISTORY BUT A MORE THOROUGH STUDY OF THE SIMPLER PERIODS MR HUTH MADE A STRONG PLEA FOR THE RETENTION OF ANCIENT HISTORY ON THE GROUND THAT THE ANCIENT INSTITUTIONS WERE SIMPLER THAN THE MODERN THAT THE CURRENTS OF HISTORY WERE NOT SO COMPLEX THAT WE HAVE ABUNDANCE OF CONCRETE MATERIAL FOR ILLUSTRATION AND THAT THE ANCIENT CULTURE HAS AN IMPERISHABLE VALUE AS A STIMULUS TO THE MIND OF MAN AFTER BRIEF GENERAL DISCUSSION A MOTION WAS PASSED DISAPPROVING THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE HOME ECONOMICS CHAIRMAN DEAN MARION TALBOT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO SECRETARY AGNES

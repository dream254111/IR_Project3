CON FERENCE OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN RELA TIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO NATHANIEL BUTLER University of Chicago In regard to the Twentysixth Educational Conference of the academies and high schools in relations with the University of Chicago it is again as in the case of each of the two Conferences latest held proper to say that in the judgment of those who are in position to receive impressions and form opinions the Confer ence of April 17 and i8 1914 was more successful and significant than any that have preceded it Its main features are I the departmental conferences and 2 the honor examinations of high school students held on Friday afternoon 3 the general session of Friday evening 4 the annual contest in declamation and effective speaking under the direction of the Department of Public Speaking 5 the general session on Saturday forenoon and 6 the conferenceluncheon given to school administrative officers Satur day noon following the morning session To these features should be added the Presidents luncheon in the Reynolds Club to all visiting school officers and pupils Friday noon and the entertain ment at supper of the visiting highschool officers at Lexington Hall of visiting highschool boys at Hutchinson Commons of visiting highschool girls at the lunch room of Emmons Blaine Hall and the social hour from 5oo to 6oo on Friday under the direction of the Undergraduate Council of the University provid ing for the entertainment of visiting highschool boys and girls The general subject of the departmental conferences was Recent Progress and Present Conditions in the Teaching of High School Subjects This subject was discussed in departmental meetings held respectively in different lecture halls on the premises of the University The departments in which these conferences were organized are the following Biology Earth Science English French German Greek and Latin History Home Economics Manual Arts Mathematics Physical Education Physics and 465THE SCHOOL REVIEW Chemistry and Public Speaking Attendance at these conferences was far in excess of that recorded at any of the previous annual Conferences The largest lecture rooms available were in many cases too small to accommodate those wishing to attend The Friday evening session was devoted to the general consider ation of The Higher Education for Women President Mary E Woolley LLD Mount Holyoke College South Hadley Mass discussed The Practical Value of a Liberal Arts Training for Women Miss Abby L Marlatt head of the department of home economics University of Wisconsin Education of the Woman for Larger Responsibility in Home Making The subject of Dean Sarah Louise Arnold of Simmons College Boston was Three Aspects of the Education of Women On Saturday morning the general subject The Definition or Delimitation of the High School was discussed Special regard was had to three phases of this general topic I the present tendency to add to the high school course two years of what is now undertaken in the Junior college 2 the organization of the Junior high school underlying the last three years of the highschool work 3 the tendency to compress into a smaller compass the period at present devoted to elementary and secondary education The subjects were discussed by Dean Babcock of the University of Illinois Principal Jesse B Davis Grand Rapids Mich Principal M H Stuart Manual Training High School Indianapolis Ind and Principal W J Bogan Lane Technical High School Chicago Following are condensed reports of the departmental sessions of Friday afternoon Biology ChairmenH C COWLEs Botany University of Chicago a H H NEWMAN Zoology University of Chicago Secretary H B SHINN Carl Schurz High School Attendance 85 The following topics were discussed i The Instruction of Young People in Respect to Sex T W Galloway James Millikin University Decatur Ill Discussion led by Miss Mary P Blount Cook County Normal School and H B Shinn Carl Schurz High School Papers given at this conference will appear in full in School Science 466TWENTYSIXTH CONFERENCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS 467 2 Recent Advances in the Knowledge of Sex a Experimental Biology of Sex J W MacArthur b Cytology of Sex L W Sharp In speaking on the subject The Instruction of Young People in Respect to Sex Dr T W Galloway stated that sex instruction was too broad to be treated from the physicians standpoint alone that for this reason teachers should give it that they will be specially trained for this work within a few years The subjectmatter should include the family relation and a history of its evolution with its successive phases up to modern times Sex instruc tion both at home and in school should be graded to the childs awakening curiosity and intelligence and should be given in the grammar grades because home instruction is inadequate and the high school too late Dr Galloway closed by urging that all teachers try out some method Discussing the experimental biology of sex Mr J W MacArthur gave certain notable data regarding the Mendelian effects of crossbreeding and the physiological effects of removal of one kind of sex organ and the substitution by implantation of another kind of organ Thus is shown the profound effect of spermary and ovary upon the organism Cytology of sex seems to resolve itself into a numerical condition of chromo somes according to Dr L W Sharp In the cases mentioned male somatic cells contain one less chromosome than female cells The reductive divisions in maturation result in equal ova but unequal sperms Fertilization by a minor sperm results in the minor form of nucleus in cleavage stages and hence the maleness of the embryo In this way is explained parthenogenesis and the determination of sex In the general discussion Dr Mary P Blount spoke of the identity of interest between the home and the school the utilization of laboratory study as a basis for moral instruction and the advisability of demonstrating the mammalian reproductive system The teaching of reproduction as a semi mechanical phenomenon of the function of chromosomes in fertilization and inheritance and of the effects of breeding were central ideas in the zoological presentation to classes as explained by Mr Harold B Shinn Miss Enid Hennessey Dr Yarrows Mr Eisenberger Mr Blount and Principal F L Morse in question or answer brought out the following a Physicians as such are not disqualified b Sex hygiene as recently given in the Chicago high schools was successful c Sex teaching in classes is not perverted by the pupils but is appreciated it stops bad stories d Sex teaching should extend over considerable time and be given in brief talks or lessons Earth Science Chairman MRS JANE PERRY COOK Chicago Normal School Secretary WELLINGTON D JONES University of Chicago Attendance ioo The program of papers and formal discussion was as follows i The SubjectMatter for an Elementary Course in Economic and Com mercial GeographyTHE SCHOOL REVIEW I Paper by Mary J Lanier University of Chicago 2 Discussion led by Maud Butts Hyde Park High School and Jessie Lowe Smith Highland Park High School 2 The Principles Which Should Govern the Choice of Material for Courses in Regional Geography I Paper by Zonia Baber School of Education University of Chicago 2 Discussion led by Meta Mayhardt Evanston High School and Marion Sykes South Chicago High School 3 The Problem of PlaceGeography I Paper by D C Ridgley Illinois State Normal University 2 Discussion led by M E Branom Minier High School and Lewis Walker Mahomet High School 4 Field Work in Geography Its Character and Importance I Paper by Walter S Tower University of Chicago 2 Discussion led by R C Potter J Sterling Morton High School The brief informal discussions centered especially on the problem of PlaceGeography with emphasis on the need of such teaching in all geog raphy courses A motion was passed advising the chairman to appoint a committee to select a list of important placenames which should be mastered by all highschool students of geography The papers by Miss Lanier Mr Ridgley and Mr Tower are to be sent to the Journal of Geography at Madison Wis Miss Baber spoke from the follow ing outline The principles which should govern the choice of material for courses in regional geography I The Needs of Society I Relation to social environment Elimination of prejudices of race class sex politics religion patriotism 2 Relation to physical environment a Forces responsible for landscape forms b Controls responsible for kinds of vegetation c Controls responsible for animal life d Controls responsible for distribution of man II The Needs of Youth I Intellectual needs a Wide scope for imaginationbroad outlook b Clear

ELIZABETH AVERY Wendell Phillips High School Attendance 128 The program planned by Mr Crowe had for its subject a comprehensive review of the publications on literature and on composition Each division of the subject was presented in two papers the first in each case dealing with the material in the course and the second dealing with method especially oral method Mr C L Hooper of the Chicago Normal College presented the subject of Material in the course in literaturethe selection of readings After a brief history of the present College Entrance Requirement lists for class and home reading he reported conclusions drawn from several investi gations which have been made The first one attempted to discover the prefer ences of the pupils Out of a list of 41 books the first ten preferred were fiction A Tale of Two Cities The Last of the Mohicans Ivanhoe and Hamlet standing first Cranford stood far down The last four were The Ancient Mariner Sesame and Lilies Essay on Burns and Emersons Essays Pupils prefer vivid and dramatic presentations with strong ethical import Another investigation made in five cities of New York sought the sources of interest The strongest interest was found to be in plot yet as the pupil grew older there was less interest in plot and more in character The interest in moral was slight in the eighth grade becoming marked in the second and third years of high school Interest in style rose from 8 per cent in the eighth grade to 20 per cent in the third year Current fiction preferred in the first year of high school gave place to classic fiction in the third year The essay and poetry appeared to excite little interest except with a story The investigation which produced the Chicago Course of Study in English which separates the literature and composition resulted in making composition equal in importance to literature in making possible a more accurate grading and more definite standards of promotion and in securing continuity and con centration The new course recommends untechnical method freedom of choice radiation of home reading historical background with text as refer ence oral reports including narration choice of technical literature from any source accessible The individual problem is recognized and provided for Mr Theodore B Hinckley of the University High School presented Method in the course in literaturethe oral reading of literature the study of verse He treated the subject under the headings Who Is to Do the Reading How Is It to Be Done and How Treated The fashion of the day is for oral expression Little fault is found with method but complaints are heard of inadequate training in reading There is too much notetaking Great literature can best be presented orally Written words are dead symbols Literature is an art not a science and must be treated through the voice The teacher must be able to interpret theTHE SCHOOL REVIEW printed page Pupils also must read but should not be asked to read at sight The reading should be done in a simple natural manner This does not refer to the literature of fact that which we read merely for information Dramatization is unnecessary likely to be a hodgepodge and takes too much time Students can do their own dramatization mentally emotionally Why dramatize the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales Material on the study of verse may be found in The Teaching of Poetry by Harry Paul in the English Journal in Verse Making in Our Schools in the Pedagogical Seminary and in Enjoyment of Poetry by Max Eastman Miss Elizabeth Buchanan of the Hyde Park High School presented a paper on Material in the course in compositionsubjects for themes and exercises The paper was read by Miss Jane C Tunnell of the same school Miss Buchanan called attention to certain experiments one of which attempted to determine the variation of one teacher from another in the matter of grading work Another tested the pupils i to secure information that will enable school authorities to formulate in objective terms the ends to be obtained in the teaching of writing and composition 2 to measure efficiency of methods used to secure results 3 to determine the factors which condition learning and teaching 4 to furnish data that will make possible comparison of school with school of teacher with teacher Such a test would be of value in enabling teachers to treat the individual more intelligently It is especially interesting in connection with determining what a pupil should be able to do at various stages of his progress Miss Fish in an article on What Pupils Should Know When They Enter High School said they should have the habit of reading intelligently and of expressing their ideas in clear and gram matical sentences Less time should be given to elementary rhetoric and more to intelligent reading and clear expression The training of pupils to think should be left to the college according to Frank Aydelotte of the University of Indiana In high school they should be taught what they can learn This view is not accepted by Dudley Miles He says pupils can be led into a reflective attitude and can be taught to reject snap judgments Another refutation occurs in the success of the experiment at Grand Rapids discussed under the title Vocational Guidance through English Composition The search for new material to be used in composi tion courses revealed nothing better than the teacher may find any day by seizing upon the life about him The subject of Method in the course in oral composition with a list of articles consulted was presented by Miss Alda M Stephens of the Englewood High School The material gathered was discussed under three subdivisions pleas for oral composition the definition or scope of the term oral compo sition and the methods of instruction employed Oral composition was found to be practical in that it made for clear simple English for distinct enunciation correct pronunciation for ease of body and control of voice Its scope includes according to the various definitions given 470TWENTYSIXTH CONFERENCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS 471 anything oral from the proper recitation to the formal argumentative oration and on to dramatics The method involves the recital of personal experiences with criticism by pupils of the work of other pupils the choice of the best of this group to take part in a debate oral discussion on topics not prepared beforehand oral presentation of passages found in the literature class conversation sustained for a given length of time A test of the value of oral composition was reported by the committee of the Illinois Association Classes were organized in which halftime was to be given to oral composition and half to written with student criticism Other courses omitted the oral themes and student criticism The results of the former were found to be more satisfactory in thought in rhetorical and gram matical structure and at least as good in the mechanical points of form The students themselves showed improvement in thoroughness in lessened arti ficiality in improved conclusions and in general vigor and enthusiasm French Chairman E B BABCOCK University of Chicago Secretary A COLEMAN University of Chicago Attendance 75 The conference of the French section was devoted largely to a considera tion of method The most considerable contributor was Mr Arthur Bovee of the University High School in a paper on certain aspects of the Direct Method and in a specimen lesson in which he showed what a highschool class can be made to do after twentyfour weeks of such training Mr Bovees chief contention was that it is quite possible to have the pupil understand the foreign tongue directly and he laid much stress on the means by which the teacher may arrive at this Chief of these are putting the words and even the concepts into action and the free use of contrast and negation building up from the known to the unknown But the teacher need not stop here to bear this out Mr Bovee distributed an outline of the grammatical work his class had covered by means of systematized exercises the use of the article and partitive construction pronouns and adjectives the gender and number of nouns the conversational tenses of regular and the principal irregular verbs reflexives numerals negation In the lesson that followed the pupils wrote difficult words from the sound and followed with ease the interpretation of a story heard for the first time In the comment that ensued it was pointed out that the pupils were evidently using English in their mental processes even if the vernacular were banished from their ears but Mr Bovee replied that though this was unavoid able they were at least having things presented to them in as French an atmos phere as possible The section did not express any opinion on the Direct Method as such but manifested keen interest in Mr Bovees presentationTHE SCHOOL REVIEW Miss DeLagneau of Lewis Institute presented reviews of Fraser and Squairs Shorter French Course and of Gieses Graded French Method The former had been found satisfactory in a class for teachers The phonetic introduction is more carefully worked out than in the old book and the lessons in phonetic script are helpful in the classroom drill It is to be regretted however that phonetic equivalents are no longer given in the main vocabulary Professor Giese in his book presents a series of carefully devised exercises for translation and composition in which vocabulary and grammatical principles are driven home by constant repetition and reworking of the same material which will also furnish the competent teacher with ample matter for oral practice Defects in the book are the difficulty of the earlier lessons and the flippant tone adopted by the author in his exercises Miss Williams of Joliet Township High School spoke briefly of Davids Chez Nous She had found it the most interesting and most thoroughly French of readers but thought it perhaps too difficult for firstyear work German Chairman CHARLES GOETTSCH University of Chicago Secretary JOHN C WEIGEL University of Chicago Attendance 80 The formal program dealing with the recent progress and present condi tions in the teaching of German divided itself as follows i Report on the Recent Bulletins on the Teaching of German in Secondary Schools Arthur S Merrill Francis W Parker School 2 Review of Articles on First and SecondYear German Gladys M Graham Carl Schurz High School 3 The New Trend in Recent Textbooks Lydia M Schmidt University High School I Mr Merrills paper was an outline of the revised version of a report by the Committee on Modern Languages appointed by the National Educa tion Association in connection with other committees of a similar nature for the purpose of studying the reorganization of secondary education The report in full is to be published later by the Bureau of Education This report goes into specific details as to a aims b method c materials d details of procedure e texts to be used in modernlanguage instruction In this connection Mr Merrill also called attention to the very excellent bibliography of American magazine articles on the teaching of modern languages which is to be found in Professor C H Handschins valuable monograph The Teaching of Modern Languages in the United States published by the US Bureau of Education 9 I3 as Bulletin No 3 2 Two papers representing recent thought in modernlanguage instruc tion were reviewed by Miss Graham The first of these which appeared in the School Review for January I913 and was written by W R Price modern language inspector of the state of New York deals with The Second Year of a 472TWENTYSIXTH CONFERENCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS 473 Modern Language Mr Price believes that the aim of our modernlanguage teaching should be the acquirement of a good reading rather than a speaking knowledge of the language He insists however that oral drill is absolutely necessary toward obtaining a certain Sprachgefiihl of such great importance in reading In the second year of the high school the foreign language should be the language of the classroom Translation should be done outside of class All class work should take the form of questions and answers on the basis of the text here should be the time for drill for explaining the coming lesson Conversation should not be disconnected but should be based upon the text read The second article entitled Beobachtungen auf dem Gebiete des fremd sprachlichen Unterrichts by BaxterCollins in Monatshefte fur deutsche Sprache und Pddagogik for October I909 emphasizes the historical evolution of the teaching of modern languages in the secondary school with reference to the former domination of college instructors writing textbooks for the lower schools The type of textbook best fitted for the secondary and lower schools Mr Collins avers must evolve from the concrete experience of teachers in these schools themselves Moreover says he we attempt too much grammar in the first year The syllabus prepared by last years Conference is in line with such experience As regards the textbooks Miss Schmidts paper on the trend of pedagogy as reflected in recent books brought to light the first traces of realizing the prophecy Mr BaxterCollins made several years ago 3 Miss Schmidt introduced her paper by pointing out the general criticism aimed at modernlanguage teachingthe lack of organization Both the Direct Method and a modified form of the Direct Method have been offered as a remedy for these ills but only recently has the teaching body responded to the newer ideas as presented in these progressive methods Within a period of two years however there have appeared texts which incorporate the ideas of those in sympathy with the supporters of the Direct Method Among these books which have appeared in rather rapid succession in response to the progres sive ideas are the following divisions referring respectively to the three years a Gronow Jung Deutschland Ginn Gohdes and Buschek Sprach und Lesebuch Holt BaxterCollins First Year of German Macmillan b Schrakamp Deutsche Heimat ABC Prokosch Deutsches Lese und Uebungsbuch Holt Holzworth Gruss aus Deutschland Heath CompositionBoe zinger Miindliche und Schriftliche Ucbungen Holt the Charles E Merrill Co edition of Immensee Germelshausen and Kindertrduen c Schrakamp Ernstes und Heitres ABC Spanhoofd Aus Vergangener Zeit ABC From these books Miss Schmidt indicated the direction modernlanguage instruction in the secondary school will take in the immediate future viz an application of a modified Direct Method At the close of the papers there was a general discussion of the syllabus prepared at the last annual Conference and printed in the School Review laterTHE SCHOOL REVIEW It was directed that a committee of five be appointed by the chair to take the matter into further consideration with a view to making a report at next years Conference Greek and Latin Chairman GEORGE H ROCKWOOD Austin High School Secretary MRS ANNE HERSMAN Hyde Park High School Attendance 76 I Report of the Committee on the Minimum Amount of Form and Syntax Work in Connection with HighSchool Latin Miss Frances Sabin Oak Park High School chairman Copies of the outline recommended by the committee were distributed Miss Sabin commented on the work of the committee and the difficulties encountered by the teacher Professor W G Hale University of Chicago had distributed copies of a substitute outline and also of the Report of the Joint Committee on Grammatical Nomenclature He explained his objections to the committees outline Discussion Miss Elizabeth Faulkner principal of the Faulkner School moved that a committee be appointed by the chair to arrange a vocabulary according to meaning and derivation to be used in each highschool year the committee to report at the next Conference Motion carried 2 Report on Recent Publications of Interest to Teachers of Greek and Latin List distributed Mr H F Scott University High School commented on Latin books Professor R J Bonner University of Chicago on Greek books Mr Bonner moved that a committee be appointed by the chair on predigested or simplified texts and alternate texts the committee to report at the next meeting of the Conference Motion carried The chair appointed a committee on committees Mr Johnson of Lane Technical High School chairman Professors Hall Miller and Bonner of the University of Chicago History Chairman MARCUS W JERNEGAN University of Chicago Secretary ARTHUR F BARNARD University of Chicago Attendance Ioo The subject for discussion was the preliminary report of the Committee on Social Studies in the Secondary School This committee is one of the National Education Association subcommittees on the Reorganization of Secondary Education The report is to be found in Bulletin No 41 for I9I3 of the Bureau of Education It is summarized in the History Teachers Magazine for December I913 Mr Tryon of the College of Education summarized the report of the committee The committee has a strong sociological bias as is indicated in 474TWENTYSIXTH CONFERENCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS 475 its name purpose and in the membership of the committee Although repre sentative in a professional sense the committee is not so geographically as a clear majority are from the North Atlantic states In the fiveyear course outlined by the committee the first year is to be devoted to community civics and to a survey of vocations and the last year to economics and to civic theory and practice Out of five units the committee devotes three to history This is to be socialized the aim being the cultivation of a spirit of good citizenship Toward this end it is to be studied topically rather than chronologically and the past is to be subordinated to the present Thus the first unit is to cover the whole of recorded history to the year I700 AD The second unit is modern European history from I700 AD and the third American history In each of these latter courses again the emphasis is on presentday conditions and problems The report was discussed from the standpoint of the university by Professor McLaughlin of the University of Chicago He referred to his diffidence in criticizing the work of the committee as his experience on such committees had given him a keen sense of the difficulty of the task and had possibly fixed his viewpoint He stated that he agreed with the committee that the time for dictating for the high schools is past The course should be arranged to develop boys and girls The emphasis on modern history is inevitable The time re duction makes it very difficult to cover the whole field of history Must ancient history be eliminated Whatever plan of excision be adopted quality and not quantity of information should be the aim The interest and enthusiasm of the student must be aroused and a love of reading and the knack of finding things in books cultivated Above all the aim should be always the cultivation of the attitude of historicalmindedness The speaker warned of the danger in constantly unsettling the curriculum The present necessity is not in determining order of studies but learning how to teach As great danger exists in the overemphasis on the study of present conditions The value of culture of what is permanent in the civilization of the past cannot be mini mized The educational value of history must not be subordinated to knowledge of passing things The report was considered from the standpoint of the high school by Mr Bobbitt of the Oak Park High School From his own experience with such a course he criticized the community civics of the first year on the ground that the subject was covered in the grades He made no objection to the history courses as outlined but raised a warning against distorting history to suit the views of any group The courses laid down for the fifth year were criticized Economics is too theoretical and abstract for the high school A substitute might be found in industrial history The course in civic theory is too advanced in its nature and the books recommended are above the level of the highschool pupil The discussion was opened by Mr Huth of the University of Chicago He looked upon the report as proceeding from a desire to introduce newTHE SCHOOL REVIEW subjects and expel old subjectsas almost socialistic in its tre ndand spirit The first unit of history is frankly impossible The knowledge the highschool graduate has of history is already too vague What is needed is not a change of perspective in history but a more thorough study of the simpler periods Mr Huth made a strong plea for the retention of ancient history on the ground that the ancient institutions were simpler than the modern that the currents of history were not so complex that we have abundance of concrete material for illustration and that the ancient culture has an imperishable value as a stimulus to the mind of man After brief general discussion a motion was passed disapproving the report of the committee Home Economics Chairman DEAN MARION TALBOT University of Chicago Secretary AGNES K HANNA University of Chicago Attendance I 25 Miss Anna Green of the DeKalb High School discussed the general method of values of Food and Sanitation a new highschool text by Mildred Wigley and Mrs Foster This book is not yet in print but was used in manuscript form by Miss Green The particular problem discussed in this book is the introduction of home economics from an experimental standpoint Miss Green explained that one of its greatest values was in being eminently practical as it had been founded on actual class experience Sanitation is taken up from a study of the municipal problem Miss Wheeler of the University of Missouri discussed the subject of nutri tion in the high schools She emphasized the difficulty of the introduction of nutrition in a course because of the congestion of most highschool home economics courses and of the further difficulty of handling in an elementary way this rather advanced subject She advised the introduction of work in nutrition by treating it incidentally in connection with individual foods rather than as a special subject She also suggested that much valuable work could be done by correlating the work in nutrition with other science work in the course Miss Wheeler discussed some of the wellknown textbooks on nutri tion and advised that material be derived from various sources rather than from one particular textbook Miss Feeney of the School of Education presented a summary of recent bulletin material received from the Agricultural Department and State Experi ment Stations She also suggested that this type of printed material be used when textbooks are not available Miss Nesbitt visiting dietitian of the Juvenile Court outlined a study of standard of living which she has been making as the result of investigations of 6oo families This material is to be published by the Journal of Home Economics Miss Church of the Lucy Flower Technical High School presented the work in house decoration and costume design as given in the Lucy Flower 476TWENTYSIXTH CONFERENCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS 477 Technical High School Miss Church gave a list of available magazine articles She advised the approach to house decoration from the practical basis of a concrete house plan and included in her work the general archi tecture and color problems and general design in house furnishings and textiles In costume design Miss Church advocates the value of work in clay modeling as a beginning to give a sense of form Here again Miss Church uses actual work with textures in planning costumes instead of merely paper and pencil representation Miss Nancy Gladish of the Austin High School discussed a recent article in the Journal of Home Economics by Mary E Parker The work of the technical high school is not in most cases strictly vocational The distinction between vocational work and general training such as is usually given in many of the high schools has in most cases not been drawn and Miss Gladish explained how her experience in highschool work brought out this same pointthat the type of work which gives girls training in household art does not meet the problem of the trade Miss Gladishs paper was followed by a discussion on the distinction between trade and general highschool training led by Miss Wells of the Lucy Flower Technical High School Miss Wells presented the trade experi ence of the eight girls who had graduated from the twoyear vocational course at the Lucy Flower High School Miss Breckinridge of the University of Chicago discussed the work of Miss Nesbitt and suggested a further study of the standard of living that had been made in the Stockyards district by Mr Kennedy Miss Breckin ridge made a plea for the introduction of schools for the needle trades in Chicago and cited the experiments being tried at the University Settlement and Hull House Miss Breckinridge outlined the great need of training for the girls of fourteen years of age and suggested the value of defining the minimum training which would fit these girls for effective wage earning To be continued

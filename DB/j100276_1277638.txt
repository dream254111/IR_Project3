j100276,Michigan Law Review,1277638,Objective Law Examinations,i254548,OBJECTIVE LAW EXAMINATIONS IN an article on Objective Law Examinations in the December I92I number of the ILLINOIS LAW REVIEw1 Professor Albert Kocourek gives a somewhat idealistic and to the present writer an unconvincing argument for that kind of law school examina tion where the student is to answer merely YEs No orthis last to a limited number of questionsO unanswered The argument is largely statistical being based on an experiment with fiftythree 53 law students mainly if not entirely of the first year in the course known at Northwestern as Chattels I and with fiftysix 56 college students unacquainted presumably with any but newspaper law and consisting principally if not entirely of psy chology students The fiftythree 53 law students were sub jected to this YEs No or DONT KNOW examination which is the objective or dogmatic examination and also to a casemethod question examination calling for reasoned answers The nonlegal college students were of course tested by the YEs No or DONT KNOW examination only The socalled dogmatic examination was by oral questions and special effort was made to put ques tions that were free from the very common drawback of division of authority 2 the casemethod examination was by written ques tions Professor Kocourek sets out the first question of the written or ratiocinative examination and the first five questions of the oral or dogmatic examination as follows Following is the first one of the list of five written questions A wrongfully cuts down oak trees belonging to B and inter mingles the logs with ash logs of his own B intentionally takes the intermingled logs out of As possession and intermingles them with ash and oak logs of his own C now wrongfully takes the whole lot of logs and manufactures oak chairs and ash chairs i What can A do about it Explain 2 What can B do about it Explain Following are the first five of the list of fifty oral questions 1 6 ILL L REv 304 2Id 309 noteOBJECTIVE LAW EXAMINATIONS I Which is the broader term chattels or personal prop erty  2 Were chattels subject to feudal tenure 3 Do chattels pass to the

except as may be deduced from his class designation as Junior Senior PostGraduate Commerce etc The one Commerce student may have had a little business law but the assumption of Professor Kocourek apparently is as certainly it 5 6 ILL L REv 313 3I4 Student I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 II 12 I3 I4 I5 I6 17 I8 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 517MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW ought to be that these Liberal Arts students were devoid of a knowledge of any law except newspaper law On the basis of the foregoing experiments and on the seemingly unwarranted assumption that they are sufficiently representative of what normally would happen if they were tried generally Pro fessor Kocourek reaches the conclusion that on the whole the dog matic type of examination furnishes a proper basis for grading students in that it will approximate the accuracy of ratiocinative examinations6 although A ratiocinative examination carefully prepared and graded gives a more satisfactory account in individual instances of a pupils attainments than a dogmatic examination7 For the dogmatic examination not to work injustice to individ uals however it seems that it must be adopted in all or practically all of the courses in the law school for Accuracy of result by mechanical methods for individual cases can only be expected where the qualifications of the candidates are unknown in exam inations in a group of subjects where the good fortune of the pupil in one instance will probably be neutralized by his ill fortune in another8 It is not the purpose of the present writer to discuss the statis tical deductions made from the tables but simply to take issue with some of the seeming assumptions made in favor of the dog matic examination One assumption seems to be that the dogmatic examination system can be kept from degenerating into a farce and is based on the supposed success of this experiment in Chattels I The agelong game played between teachers and students where the teacher tries to get the maximum from the student and the lat ter seeks to give the minimum is a condition in law schools as well as other schools How young men preparing for a professional career can spend much misdirected thought in trying to get the highest possible grades with the least possible effort is a mystery but many of them do it and will continue to do so The socalled dogmatic examination system would be sure to break down because of that very fact The writer has been favored by one of the law students experi 6 16 ILL L REv 315 7 Id 314 8Id 315 518OBJECTIVE LAW EXAMINATIONS mented upon in the dogmatic examination in Chattels I with a comment on that examination and on Professor Kocoureks article about such examinations Table No I is so constructed that any student in the class and any teacher acquainted with the grades in that class could pick out Pupil B or Student B at once and the comment mentioned is by Student B Student B who received all As in his law school work and who is entitled to be exempt from any suggestions that his mind is slowmoving received only a grade of 74 in the dogmatic examination Yet a Federal Board College student who presumably knew no law also received 74 in that dog matic examination That fact might have been urged as a reflec tion on teaching at Northwestern for if a nonlegal student passes as successfully a proper kind of law examination as does a law student the natural question is whether the law teacher is not wasting his time at our schooli e whether instruction in North western is not worthless That absurd conclusion is to be avoided only by the recognition to its full extent of the fact that the non legal student attained his good grades through chance and that the same chance may cause the superior law student to get low grades in such an examination The full extent of the gross injustice which may be done to individual law students in this socalled dog matic examination is obscured in Professor Kocoureks article by an apparent assumption that if the individual runs such chances in twenty or thirty examinationssupposedly the normal number in a threeyear period9he will probably get too high grades enough times to neutralize too low grades at other times10 That is not a convincing probability in the case of so few examinations if indeed it be a probability in the case of a larger number But even that is not the worst to be said about the dogmatic examination Much more objectionable is the fact that such an examination system would furnish an incentive to organized minimization of effort for the passing of such examination to the detriment of serious work in the school and to a lowering of the moral tone That is brought out in the memorandum prepared by Student B which is valuable both as a courageous expression of student opinion and as a record of an individual students experience It is inserted here for the 9 i6 ILL L REv 315 note I7 10 Id 316 5r9OBJECTIVE LAW EXAMINATIONS light which it casts on the possibility of a system of dogmatic exam inations in any one course let alone all the courses of the school Student Bs memorandum with his own footnotes is as follows OBJECTIVE LAW EXAMINATIONSVIEWS OF A STUDENT After reading Professor Kocoureks article on Objective Law Examinations it has struck me that a discussion of the same subject from the students pointof view is indispensable to a cor rect understanding of the whole situation I may as well begin by confessing at once who I am and why I am so interested in the question I was one of the class in Chattels upon whom the experi ment of two examinations one dogmatic oral and one ratio cinative written was tried with the results indicated in Table I of Professor Kocoureks article As it happens I have even been able to pick myself out of this table although the students there are only named by letter alphabetically Perhaps indiscreetly the maker of the table included a column of Total Grades at Term By referring to my own report of grades and by finding that my own particular combination of hours curiously enough is only once found in that column I have been able to discover that I am there under the alias of Pupil B or Student B Still another curious hap pening Student B is the subject of some especial comment because he attained second rank in the ratiocinative and only twentieth in the dogmatic examination Very good that was about the propor tion I had expected after taking the examinations But imagine my chagrin upon deducing my own mental characteristics from page 308 There in the first paragraph it is said that there are three intellectual types I those who give the best account of their talents in a written ratiocinative test where there is opportunity for considerable reflection 2 those who do best in an oral test where the mind is stimulated by a facetoface struggle for a mark and 3 those who exhibit substantially the same mental form in either case In a footnote Student B is referred to as the shining exam ple of type I and Student H as that of type 2 The next para graph of the text goes on to say in reference to these two types There is room in a legal career for the slowmoving and accurate 11 16 ILL L REV 304 520MICHIGAN LAW REVIEWi intellect as well as for the quicklyresponsive and sometimes inac curate one This startled me for I was unaccustomed to being called intellectually slowmoving and accurate The whole gen eralization is to my mind just an example of the many fallacies which are likely to result from such grouptests The examiner believed that my comparative failure in the oral examination was due to lack of time As a matter of fact I remember that I answered nearly every question in half the time allowed perhaps too quickly But I found that if I knew the answer I knew it at once while if I did not know it took even less time to toss a mental coin in the air and record the record the result yes or no instead of heads or tails The best pokerplayers they say act on the instant inspiration of Fortune However the purpose of this communication is not simply to air my own grievances As a matter of fact I have no objection except of principle to the results of that course for I received an A in Chattels I have stated my own case so far for two reasons aside from the fact that it may be amusing first because it shows that I am unmistakably partisan and the reader should not err on that score but second because it shows that such partisanship is based wholly upon my experience with the examinations themselves and not upon anything outside In other words I am one of the individuals upon whom the oral examination used alone would work an injustice and as such I have a right to protest In discussing the general question of the advisability of adopting oral examinations I shall not discuss at all in detail either the oral examinations as given12 or the tables as drawn up by Professor Kocourek but shall deal only with his conclusions Reducing them to a few sentences they are in substance as follows Ratiocinative written examinations carefully prepared and graded give a more satisfactory account in individual instances than dogmatic examina tions but if all the courses of a law school are put upon a mechan 12 Much criticism has arisen among the students in regard to specific examinations given as that questions were given that were capable of two answers and that the system of credit was unfair Possibly however those details might be smoothed outwith the grand exception of the most impor tant cause of complaint the tremendous part played by the element of luck This is discussed in the next note 52IOBJECTIVE LAW EXAMINATIONS ical oral basis individual justice is obtained on a sort of insur ance idea because the good fortune of the pupil in one instance will probably be neutralized by his ill fortune in another13 This leaving of ultimate justice to the law of averages is almost too absurd to be ventured except heavily veiled in figures and tables Here it is propounded as the ultimate reason for adopting a new measure in a school of law a school of that common law which from time immemorial has attempted to treat each case upon its own merits Shall judges of the future proceed upon a lawofaverages idea and toss a coin in a tight case because the same litigants are engaged in several other lawsuits and good fortune in one instance will probably be neutralized by ill fortune in another How many of us except insufferable optimists are willing even to trust to the neutrality of fortune However even suppose that such a system would result in approx imate justice as to the individual students general average in all his law school courses Even so I have always supposed that one took individual courses somewhat for their own sake and not sim 13 Professor Kocourek is forced to come to this conclusion by his Table II which by the way is worth close scrutiny since it is almost the reductio in absurdum of his own article This table shows the results of this same oral examination upon a group of 56 nonlaw students They had not taken the course in Chattels presumably they did not even know any law at all yet just by guessing one has attained 74 another 70 6 gained from 60 to 70 and 27 gained from 50 to 60 Only 21 are below 50 Luck was certainly lavish in that round of the roulette wheel for needless to say 50 is the mean of the law of averages in this examination Perhaps these students did have some knowledge with which to answer the questions If that is the way their success is explained I cannot see exactly what I for instance learned from the course in Chattels because the highest nonlaw man got 74 in the oral examination and 74 is exactly the grade attained by Student B myself By that test apparently I learned nothing but I am sure that I did learn something my other examination showed that However in order to justify his teaching at all Professor Kocourek must admit that these nonlaw men were simply lucky He does admit this but he does not dwell upon it half long enough in my opinion The beauty of the oral examination from the point of view of those who know little or nothing about the matter in question is that they always can answer anyway even though they have not understood the question put And in making that answer their chances are 5050 that they are right Let us hope that they do not proceed upon the same theory after they have entered practice of the law 522MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW ply for their bearing upon ones attainment of a degree How is the individual to have any inkling of his qualifications in an indi vidual course if he must consider only the ultimate justice of all his grades in toto But now let us even waive in this discussion the point of indi vidual justice in marking important though it is from the point of view of the student Nevertheless there is one obvious considera tion of policy which Professor Kocourek seems to have forgotten in his discussion and that is that examinations exist for other pur poses than for marking alone This is particularly true in a law school and I can best show it by tracing the inevitable result of a longcontinued use of the oral or indeed any mechanical exam inations The problems given in the oral examination in Chattels were all found in the cases studied in that course Moreover there were only a limited number of problems that could be found in those cases As anyone who has studied under the casesystem knows the actual rules of law covered in a casebook can be covered in a textbook in onefourth the space Moreover the questions upon which there is any conflict of authority or of reason are unavailable for the oral examination as Professor Kocourek him self explains These are very many and often the most interesting points The remaining rules could be collected and codified by a few members of any class any year They could then be produced in any required number by the device of typewritten carbon copies or if expedient by mimeographing depending upon the ingenuity and business ability of the leading spirits of the class I may state that this is no mere dream in all probability it would have been done by us last year if we had not had the written examination to prepare for at the same time After such preparation it was super fluous But just to give more definite reality to my picture let me tell of an experience in another course General Survey i first half As a part of that course there was required a knowledge of some seven hundred legal definitions all contained in long tiresome para graphs in a work known as Robinsons Elementary Law The accepted mode of preparation for an examination which consisted of one hundred words or phrases to be defined had been to read through some ten or twelve times this book of 692 pages A group of students of whom I was one hit upon a laborsaving method 523OBJECTIVE LAW EXAMINATIONS We divided the book among us each one making a list of short snappy definitions of the words or phrases in his section We then put all the lists together made copies and memorized the entire list of seven hundred eac hone of us thus had only to read one seventh of the book We were so successful in that examination that one of us received the highest mark 99X2 six of us together with one outsider outside our grouphow he did it was subject of great speculation to us were the only ones above o9 while the rest of the class averaged as I remember about 60 To their dis may the passing grade was raised because of our efforts to 80 and most of the students required to take the examination over again They looked upon us an mental prodigies but the only real mental prodigy was that one outsider who was above go This year I understand copies of our lists are available for the whole class One does not even need a copy of Robinson but only a good mem ory and a few days of work Now in that examination all that was wanted was a list of defi nitions memorized and we did what was wanted But a list of legal rules for an oral examination is just as easy to memorize without true memory a month later and one can find it often in CORPUS JURIS all made ready to be copied Professor Kocourek may say that that is all that is wanted in his examinations But then I ask why he does not at once teach the law that way Why go through all the class discussion Why use the casesystem at all But I am sure there is no need of questioning his champion ship of the casediscussion system14 I can remember that some of the most stimulating discussions of my first year were in this very course in Chattels and the instructors very method showed beyond doubt his fundamental belief in the value and importance of rea soning and discussion In fact he almost never spent any time upon the extraction or recital of legal rules but rather gave us each hour a few very close hypothetical cases over which to wrangle 14 There is no room here for a discussion of the merits of the case sys tem Let me just ask in this connection what good a lawyer can get from a memorized set of legal rules comparable to the analytical and logical meth ods given him by legal reasoning When is he asked to answer yes or no without having looked up the matter in a book When indeed is he ever asked an answer without a reason given or at least a reason known 524MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW hotly These were just the opposite type from the cases given in the oral examination Professor Kocourek may say that although he does believe in the discussion system in classwork a dogmatic examination is still sat isfactory just for the purpose of grading The answer is that no examination should be just for the purpose of grading It should be likewise an incentiveeven if it is only a whip And there is no incentive to discussion and reasoning and reading of cases compar able to an examination in the reasoning of cases Some students might be interested in a discussiongroup class even if they knew that they had only to memorize a list to pass the course But those students would be interested without any examination at all exam inations exist for the indifferent majority and if they exist at all for them they should be effectual examinationseffectual against such indifference This is one of the primary principles of education STUDENT B In explanation of the reference in the foregoing memorandum to the experience in General Survey I it should be said that the illustration while apt as a warning of what can be done in prepara tion for any dogmatic examination is no reflection on the exam ination in General Survey I One purpose of that course is to make a firstyear law student as familiar with legal terminology as it is possible to get him in the first six weeks in law school The important thing is to require him to define 50 to Ioo legal words or terms out of a list of 700 defined in Robinsons Elementary Law If he can get satisfactory definitions elsewhere or by division of labor with his fellow students well and good He is getting needed legal atmosphere at the first possible moment and the purpose of the first part of the course would seem to be served My experience in teaching the course on Contracts last year was that the purpose was well served But what was done to prepare for that definition test in General Survey I would be sure to defeat the purpose of an examination when put in operation to meet a dogmatic exam ination in Chattels I or in any other law school course In closing this article it remains but to consider the cause of the experiment in dogmatic examinations The drudgery of reading examination books is offered as the reason for this dogmatic oral examination The assumption is that there is undue drudgery in 525OBJECTIVE LAW EXAMINATIONS the reading and grading of examination books I do not of course deny that there is drudgery but except in the case of schools where classes are excessively large that drudgery is not undue There is drudgery in all lines of human endeavor and the average law teacher pursuing the casemethod undergoes much less drudgery and does much more interesting class work than most teachers do At the few law schools having very large classes the drudgery of reading bluebooks is doubtless undue but in a school like North western where classes are kept within reasonable sizelimits while there is drudgery in such work I cannot agree that it is undue in amount But even if it were undue that fact would not justify the use of dogmatic or objective examinations in law schools The ease with which undetectable signals as to proper answers could be arranged between those inclined for a consideration or for friendship to assist in cheating would of itself seem to present an insuperable obstacle to the use of such examinations by bar examiners if not by law schools GEORGE P COSTIGAN JR Northwestern

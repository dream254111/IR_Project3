Letter of the 9th of Octob 1676 here Englishd Concerning little Animals by him observed in Rain Well Sea and Snowwater as also in water wherein Pepper had lain infused IN the year 1675I discoverd living creatures in Rain water which had stood but few days in a new earthen pot glased blew within This invited me to view this water with great at tentionespecially those little animals appearing to me ten thou sand times less than those represented by Mons Swamerdam and by him called Waterfleas or Waterlice which may be per ceived in the water with the naked eye Thefirst sort by me discoverd in the said water I divers times observed to consist of 5 6 7 or 8 clear globuls without being able to discern any film that held them together or con trained them When these animalcula or living Atoms did move they put forth two little hornscontinually moving themselves The place between these two horns was flat though the rest of the body was roundishsharpning a little towards the end where they had a tayl near four times the length of the whole bodyof the thickness by my Microscope of a Spidersweb at the end of which appeard a globul of the bigness of one of those which made up the body which tayl I could not perceive even in ve ry clear water to be movd by them These little creatures if they chanced to light upon the least filament or string or other such particle of which there are many in waterespecially after it hath stood some days they stook intangled thereinextending their body in a long round and striving to disintangle their tayl whereby it came to pass that their whole body lept back towards the globul of the tayl which then rolled together Ser pentlike and after the manner of Copper or Iron wire that having been wound about a stick and unwound again retains those windings and turnings This motion of extension and contraction continued a while and I have seen several hun dreds of these poor little creatures within the space of a grain of gross sand lye fast clusterd together in a few filaments I also discoverd a second sort the figure of which was oval and I imagined their head to stand on the sharp end These were a little bigger than the former The inferior part of their body is flat furnished with divers incredibly thin feet which moved very822 very nimbly and which I was not able to discern till after seve ral Observations The upper part of the body was roundand had within 8 10 or 12 globuls where they were very clear These little Animals did sometimes change their figure into a perfect round especially when they came to lye on any dry place Their body was also very flexible for as soon as they hit against any the smallest fibre or string their body was bent in which bending presently also yerked out again When I put any of them on a dry placeI observdthat changing themselves into a round their body was raised pyramidalwife with an extant point in the middle and having lain thus a little while with a motion of their feet they burst asunder and the globuls were presently diffusd and dissipated so that I could not dis cern theleast thing of any filmin which the globuls had doubtless been inclosedAnd at this time of their bursting asunder I was a ble to discover more globuls than when they were alive But then I observd a third sort of little Animals that were twice as long as broad and to my eye yet eight times smaller than the first Yet for all this I thought I discernd little feet whereby they moved very briskly both in a round and streight line There wasfurther a fourth sort which were so small that I was not able to give them any figure at all These were a thou sand times smaller than the eye of a big Louse For I judge the axis of the eye of such a Louse to be more than ten times as long as the axis of any of the said little creatures These exceeded all the former in celerity I have often observd them to stand still as twere upon a pointand then turn themselves about with that swiftness as we see a Top turn round the circumference they made being no bigger than that of a small grain of Sand and then extending themselves streight forward and by and by ly ing in a bending posture I discoverd also several other sorts of Animals but these were very big respectivelyof which I intend not to speak here only thisthat they were generally made up of such soft parts as the formerthey bursting a sunder as soon as they came to want water ObservII The 26 May it rained hard the rain growing less I caused some of that Rainwater running down from the housetop to be gatherd in a clean Glass after it had been washed two or three823 three times with the water And in this I observd some few very little living creaturesand seeing themI thought they might have been produced in the leadengutters in some waterthat had there remaind before ObservIII On the same day the Rain continuing I took a great Porce laindish and exposed it to the free Air upon a wooden vessel about a foot and a half high that so no earthy parts from the falling of the Rainwater upon that place might be spatterd or dashed into the said dish With the first water that fell into the dish I washed it very clean and then flung the water away and receivd fresh into it but could discerno no living creatures therein only I saw many irregular terrestrial parts in the same The 30of Mayafter I hadever since the 26thobservd every day twice or thrice the same Rainwater I now discoverd some yet very fewexceeding little Animals which were very clear The 31th of MayI perceived in the same water more of those Animalsas also some that were somewhat biggerAnd I imagine that many thousands of these little Creatures do not equal an ordinary grain of Sand in bigness And comparing them with a Cheesemite which may be seen to move with the naked eye I make the proportion of one of these small Watercreatures to a Cheesemite to be like that of a Bee to a Horse Forthe cir cumference of one of these little Animals in water is not so big as the thickness of a hair in a Chesemite Observ IV June 9th having received early in the morning some Rain water in a dishas beforeand poured it into a very clean Wine glass and exposed it about 8 of the clock in the morning to the Airabout the height of the third story of my houseto find whe ther the little Animals would appear the sooner in the water thus standing in the Air Observing the same accordingly the 10th of June I imagind I saw some living creatures therein but because they seemd to be but very few in number nor were plainly discernable I had no mind to trust to this observation The 11th of the same month seeing this water move in the Glass from a stiff gale of wind which had blown for 36 hours without intermission accompanied with a cold that I could very well endure my Wintercloaths I did not thinkI should then perceive any living creatures therein yet viewing it at 5 Q tentively824 tentively I did with admiration observe a thousand of them in one drop of water which were of the smallest sort that I had seen hitherto The 12th of Junethe wind being at westthe Sun shining with interloping cloudsI viewed the same Rain waterand found the forementiond little Animals so plentifully in the water which I took up from the surfacethat one or two thousand in one sin gle drop did not make up their number The 13th of the same month viewing the same water again I found besides the Animals already noted a sort of creatures that were eight times as big as they of almost a round figure And as those very small animalcula did swim gently among one another moving like as Gnats do in the Air so did these big ger ones move far more swiftly tumbling round as twere and then making a sudden downfall The 14th of June I did find these very little creatures in no smaller number The 16th I saw them as before and this wa ter which had been in all16of a pint being now more than half dryed up I flung it away ObservV The 9th of JuneI put of the same Rainwater in a very clean Wineglass in my Counter or Study and viewing the same I perceived no living creatures in it Notethat my Study stands toward the North eastin my Anti chamber and is very close joyned together with Wainscot ha ving no other opening than one hole of an inch and a half broad and 8 inches long towards the street  with 4 windows of which the two lowermost open inwards and by night are closed with two wooden Shutsso that there comes in but little Air from without unless it be that I use a candle in making my Observations in which case I lift up a little Casementthat the steam of the candle may not offend me but yet drawing a Cur tain at that time over almost all the windows The 10th of Juneobserving the mentioned Rainwaterwhich now had stood 24 hours in my study I noted some few very small living creatures in which by reason of their extream mi nuteness I could see no figure and among the rest I discoverd one that was somewhat greater of an oval figure Notethat when I say I have viewd the water I mean that I have viewd only 34or 5 drops of the waterwhich I also flung away The825 The 11th of June looking upon this water afresh I saw the said little creatures again but there were then but very few of them The 12th I saw them as the day before besides I took no tice of one figured likeaMusselshellwith its hollowside down wards  it was of a length equal to the eye of a louse The 13th early I discoverd the extream small creatures in greater number and among them I saw a bigger one as I did be fore In the evening of the same day I saw the same very small insects again in no less number taking notice that the same had a transparent part standing our behind I discoverd also some little animals which were somewhat longer than an oval and these were about six times as big as the extream small creatures Their head which run out somewhat in length they often drew inand then appeard to be almost round I perceived also some that were altogether round and the axis of these was twice as long as that of the smallest creatures These two greater sorts were very flexile so that their body did bend at the touch of the least and finest filament The 14 of June I perceived the oval insects in greater plenty The 16I saw them in yet greater numbers and they were flat beneathand round above and besidesI noted very small crea tures that were three times as long as they were broad And di vers other sorts too long to describe here And in the evening of the same day I discoverd little feet in the small oval crea tures which were many in number as also a much bigger crea ture of the same figure which was likewise furnished with legs And here I gave over my Observations as to this water ObservVI The 17th of this month of June it rained very hard and I catched some of that Rainwater in a new Porcelain dish which had never been used before but found no living creatures at all in it but many terrestrial particlesandamong others such as I thought came from the smoak of Smiths coals and some thin thrids ten times thinner than the thrid of a Silkworm which seemd to be made up of globuls and where they lay thick up on one another they had a green colour The 26th having been eight days out of Town and kept my Study shut up closewhen I was come home and did view the said water I perceived several animalcula that were very smallAnd 5 Q 2 here826 herewith I desisted from making at this time any further Ob servations of Rainwater Mean time this Town of Delft being very rich in waterand we receiving from the River of Maase fresh water which ma keth our water very good I viewed this water divers times and saw extream small creatures in it of different kinds and co lours and even so small that I could very hardly discern their figures But some were much bigger the describing of whose motion and shape would be too tedious This only I must men tion here that the number of them in this water was far less than that of those found in Rainwater for if I saw a matter of 25 of them in one drop of this Town water that was much In the open Court of my house I have a well which is about 15 foot deep before one comes to the water It is encompassed with high wallsso that the Sunthough in Canceryet can hardly shine much upon it This water comes out of the groundwhich is sandywith such a powerthat when I have laboured to empty the well I could not so do it but there remained ever a foots depth of water in it This water is in Summer time so coldthat you cannot possibly endure your hand in it for any reasonable time Not thinking at all to meet with any living creatures in it it being of a good taste and clear looking upon it in Sept of the last year I discoverd in it a great number of living ani mals very small that were exceeding clear and a little bigger than the smallest of all that I ever saw and I think that in a grain weight of this water there was above 500 of those crea tures which were very quiet and without motion In the Winter I perceived none of these little animalsnor have I seen any of them this year before the month of July and then they appeard not very numerous but in the month of August I saw them in great plenty July 27 1676 I went to the Seaside at Schevelingen the wind coming from Sea with a very warm Sunshine and view ing some of the Seawater very attensively I discoverd divers living animals therein I gave to a man that went into the Sea to wash himself a new Glassbottle bought on purpose for that end intreating him that being on the Seahe would first wash it well twice or thrice and then fill it full of the Seawaterwhich desire of mine having been complied with I tyed the bottle close with a clean bladderand coming home and viewing it I saw827 in it a little animal that was blackish looking as if it had been made up of two globuls This creature had a peculiar motion after the manner as when we see a very little flea leaping upon a white paper so that it might very well be called a Waterflea but it was by far not so great as the eye of that little animal which Dr Swammerdam calls the Waterflea I also discovered little creatures therein that were clear of the same size with the former animal which I first observed in this water but of an o val figure whose motion was Serpent like I took further no tice of a third sortwhich were very slow in their motionTheir body was of a Mousecolour clear towards the ovalpoint and before the headand behind the body there stood out a sharp lit le point anglewife This sort was a little bigger But there was yet a fourth sort somewhat longer than oval Yet of all these sorts there were but a few of each so that in a drop of water I could see sometimes but three or four sometimes but one July 31after I had from the 27of this month viewed this wa ter every daybut perceived no little animals in itlooking up on it nowI saw an 100 where before I had seen but one but these were of an other figure and not only lesser but they were also very clear and of an oblong oval figure only with this dif ferencethat me thought their heads ended sharperAnd although they were a thousand times smaller than a small grain of sandyet I discernd that when they lay out of the water in a dry place that they burst in pieces  spred into 3 or 4 very little globuls and into some aqueous matterwithout my being able to discern any other parts in them The 2d and 4th of August I saw many of the aforesaid small a nimals but the 6th and 8th I did not by far perceive so many of them as beforeAnd those few ones I saw the 8thwere so very smalthat even by my Microscope they were hardly discernible Observations of water wherein whole Pepper had layn infused several dayes 1Having several times endeavoured to discover the cause of the pungency of Pepper upon our tongueand that the ratherbe cause it hath been found that though Pepper had lain a whole year in vinegar yet it retained still its pungency I did put a bout 13 of an ounce of whole pepper in water placing it in my Study with this design that the pepper being thereby rendred soft I might be enabled the better to observe what I proposed to828 to my selfThis pepper having lain about 3 weeks in the water to which I had twice added some Snowwater the other water being in great part exhaled I looked upon it the 24of April 1676and discernd in itto my great wonderan incredible num ber of little animalsof divers kinds and among the rest some that were 3 or 4 times as long as broad but their whole thick ness did in my estimation not much exceed that of the hair of a Louse They had a very pretty motionoften tumbling about and sideways and when I let the water run off from them they turned as round as a Top and at first their body changed into an oval and afterwards when the circular motion ceased they returned to their former length The 2d sort of creaturesdiscoverd in this water were of a perfect oval figureand they had no less pleasing or nimble a mo tion than the former and these were in far greater numbers And there was a 3d sortwhich exceeded the two former in number and these had tails also like those I had formerly observd in Rainwater The 4th sort of creatures which moved through the 3 former sorts were incredibly small and so small in my eyethat I judg edthat if 100 of them lay one by anotherthey would not equal the length of a grain of course Sand and according to this esti mate ten hundred thousand of them could not equal the dimen sions of a grain of such course Sand There was discoverd by me a fifth sort which had near the thickness of the former but they were almost twice as long 2 The 26th of April I took 2 12 ounces of Snowwater which was about three years old and which had stood either in my Cellar or Study in a Glassbottle well stoppedIn it I could dis cover no living creatures And having poured some of it into a Porcelain TheacupI put there in half an ounce of whole pep per and so placed it in my Study Observing it daily until the 3d of MayI could never discover any living thing in itand by this time the water was so far evaporated and imbibed by the pepper that some of the peppercorns began to lye dry This water was now very thick ofodd particlesand then I pou red more Snowwater to the pepper until the pepper corns were coverd with water half an inch high Whereupon viewing it again the fourth and fifth of MayI found no living creatures in it but the sixthI did very many and those exceeding small ones829 ones whose body seemd to me twice as long as broad but they moved very slowlyand often roundways The 7th I saw them yet in far greater numbers The 10th I put more Snowwater to the pepper because the former was again so exhaled that the peppercorns began to be dry again The 13th and 14thI saw the little creatures as before but the 18th the water was again so dryed awaythat it made me pour on more of it And the 23th I discoverd besides the asoresaid little animalsanother sort that were perfectly ovaland in figure like Cuckoweggs Me thought the head of them stood on the sharp end Their body did consist within of 10 12or 14 glo bulswhich lay separate from one another When I put these ani malculae in a dry placethey then changed their body into a per fect roundand often burst asunder  the globulstogether with some aqueous particles spred themselves every where about without my being able to discern any other remains These glo bulswhich in the bursting of these creatures did flow asunder here and there were about the bigness of the first very small creatures And though as yet I could not discern any feet in them yet me thoughtthey must needs be furnished with very many se ing that the smallest creatures which I said before to be very plentiful in this water and lay sometimes more than an 1 0 0 of them on one of the oval creatures were by the motion made in the water by the great onesthough to my eye they seemd to lye still driven away by them in the manner as we blow away a feather from our mouthOf the same oval creatures I never could discover any very little ones how attentive soever I was to ob serve them The 24th of May observing this water againI found in it the oval little animals in a much greater abundanceAnd in the even ing of the same day I perceived so great a plenty of the same oval ones that tis not one only thousand which I saw in one drop and of the very small onesse veral thousands in one drop   This Phaenomenon and some of the following ones seeming to be very extraordinary the Au thor hath been desired to acquaint us with his method of observing that other may confirm such obser vations  these The 25th I saw yet more oval creatures And the 26th I found so vast a plenty of those oval creatures that I believe there were more than 6 or 8 0 0 0 in one drop besides the abundance of those very little animals whose number was yet far greater This830 This water I took from the very surface but when I took up any from beneathI found that not so full of them by farObserv ingthat these creatures did augment into vast numbers but not being able to see them increase in bignessI began to think whe ther they might not in a moment as twerebe composed or put together But this speculation I leave to others The 26th of May at night I discernd almost none of the lit tle creatures but saw some with tayls of which I have spoken heretofore to have seen them in Rainwater But there drove in thewater throughout an infinity of little particles like very thin haironly with this difference that some of them were bent The 27th I perceived none at all of the little animals but great number of the bigger The 28th all sorts of those living creatures in this peppery water were grown thinner But the 30th I saw very few living creatures in the water and where I now saw but oneI had some days ago seen a hundredAnd by this time the water was so dryed away that the pepper began to lye bare And then I filld my Theadish with Snowwater again June 1 the living creatures appeard again in so great abun danceas I had ever seen beforebutas to those very small onesI cannot say that I saw themThose I sawI could nowdiscern to be furnisht with very thin legs which was very pleasant to behold The same day I discoverd a few of the very small creatures which were almost 8 times as big as the smallest of allThese had such a swift motion through the others that tis incredible Those bigger animalsthat were about 8 times smaller than the eye of a Louse were in no smaller number 3 May the 26thI took about 13 of an ounce of whole pepper and having pounded it small I put it into a Theacup with 2 12 ounces of Rainwater upon itstirring it about the better to mingle the pepper with it and then suffering the pepper to fall to the bottomAfter it had so stood an hour or twoI took some of the waterbefore spoken ofwherein in the whole pepperlayand wherein were so many several sorts of little animals and ming led it with this waterwherein the pounded pepper had lain an hour or twoand observedthat when there was much of the wa ter of the pounded pepperwith that otherthe said animals soon died but when little they remained alive June 2 in the morningafter I had made divers Observations since the 26th of MayI could not discover any living thing but saw831 saw some creatures which tho they had the figures of little a nimals yet could I perceive no life in them how attentively soever I beheld them The same day at night about 11 a clock I discoverd some few living creatures But the 3d of June 1 observed many more which were very smallbut 2 or 3 times as broad as long This water rose in bubbles like fermenting beer The 4th of June in the morning I saw great abundance of li ving creatures and looking again in the afternoon of the same day I found great plenty of them in one drop of that water which were no less than 8 or 1 0 0 0 0and they looked to my eye through theMicroscopeas common sand doth to the naked eye On the 5thI perceived besides the many very small creatures some few not above 8 or 10 in one drop of an oval figure whereof some appeard to be 7 or 8 times bigger than the rest The 6ththose animals were as beforebut the 8th the oval a nimals were increased in number swiming among the said very small creatures and now they were all very near of one and the same bignessThe 9th the oval creatures appeard yet in greater numbersbut the very small onesin less number and now using a particular method in observingI notedthat the feetwherewith the animals were furnisht did plainly move  that with an in credible swiftnessAnd me thoughtthat now  then I sawthat the globuls of which I said that the greatest part of their body was made up were not perfectly round but that every one of them had a prominent point These creatures were to my eye eight times smaller than the eye of a Louse

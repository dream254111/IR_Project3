J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,106168,ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE TORPEDO BY JOHN HUNTER F R S,I206928,481 XL ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE TOR PEDO BY JOHN HUNTER F R S I W A S DESIRED SOME TIME SINCE BY MR WALSH WHOSE EXPERIMENTS AT LA ROCHELLE HAD DETERMINED THE EFFECT OF THE TORPEDO TO BE ELECTRICAL TO DISSECT AND EXAMINE THE PECULIAR ORGANS BY WHICH THAT ANIMAL PRODUCES SO EXTRAORDINARY AN EFFECT THIS I HAVE DONE IN SEVERAL SUBJECTS FURNISHED TO ME BY THAT GEN TLEMAN READ JULY 1 1773 I AM NOW DESIRED BY HIM TO LAY BEFORE THE SO CIETY THE OBSERVATIONS I HAVE MADE AND FOR THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEM TO PRESENT ON HIS PART A MALE AND FEMALE TORPEDO IN SPIRITS IN THE LATTER OF WHICH THE ELECTRIC ORGANS ARE EXPOSED IN DIFFERENT VIEWS AND SECTIONS LIKEWISE A COPPERPLATE WHICH HE TOOK CARE TO HAVE ENGRAVED EXHIBITING THOSE ORGANS OF THE GENERAL STRUCTURE AND ANATOMY OF THE TOR PEDO I SAY NOTHING SINCE THE ANIMAL DOES NOT DIFFER VERY MATERIALLY EXCEPTING IN ITS ELECTRIC ORGANS AS THEY HAVE BEEN PROPERLY NAMED BY MR WALSH FROM THE REST OF THE RAYS OF WHICH FAMILY IT IS WELL KNOWN TO BE I WILL ONLY PREMISE THAT THE TOR PEDO OF WHICH I TREAT IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG TWELVE BROAD AND IN ITS CENTRAL OR THICKEST PART TWO INCHES THICK WHICH IS NEARLY THE SIZE OF V O L LXIII R R R THE482 THE FEMALE SPECIMEN NOW PRESENTED TO THE SOCIETY AS WELL AS OF THAT FROM WHICH THE PLATE WAS TAKEN BUT WHERE THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE ORGAN ARISING FROM DIFFERENCE IN SIZE NOTICE WILL BE TAKEN OF IT IN THIS ACCOUNT THE ELECTRIC ORGANS OF THE TORPEDO ARE PLACED ON EACH SIDE OF THE CRANIUM AND GILLS REACHING FROM THENCE TO THE SEMICIRCULAR CARTILAGES OF EACH GREAT FIN AND EXTENDING LONGITUDINALLY FROM THE ANTERIOR EXTREMITY OF THE ANIMAL TO THE TRANSVERSE CARTILAGE WHICH DIVIDES THE THORAX FROM THE ABDOMEN AND WITHIN THESE LIMITS THEY OCCUPY THE WHOLE SPACE BE TWEEN THE SKIN OF THE UPPER AND OF THE UNDER SUR FACES THEY ARE THICKEST AT THE EDGES NEAR THE CEN TER OF THE FISH AND BECOME GRADUALLY THINNER TO WARDS THE EXTREMITIES EACH ELECTRIC ORGAN AT ITS INNER LONGITUDINAL EDGE IS UNEQUALLY HOLLOWED BE ING EXACTLY FITTED TO THE IRREGULAR PROJECTIONS OF THE CRANIUM AND GILLS THE OUTER LONGITUDINAL EDGE IS A CONVEX ELLIPTIC CURVE THE ANTERIOR EXTREMITY OF EACH ORGAN MAKES THE SECTION OF A SMALL CIRCLE AND THE POSTERIOR EXTREMITY MAKES NEARLY A RIGHT ANGLE WITH THE INNER EDGE EACH ORGAN IS ATTACHED TO THE SURROUNDING PARTS BY A CLOSE CELLULAR MEMBRANE AND ALSO BY SHORT AND STRONG TENDINOUS FIBRES WHICH PASS DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM ITS OUTER EDGE TO THE SEMICIR CULAR CARTILAGES THEY ARE COVERED ABOVE AND BELOW BY THE COM MON SKIN OF THE ANIMAL UNDER WHICH THERE IS A THIN FASCIA SPREAD OVER THE WHOLE ORGAN THIS IS COM POSED OF FIBRES WHICH RUN LONGITUDINALLY OR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BODY OF THE ANIMAL THESE FIBRES AP PEAR TO BE PERFORATED IN INNUMERABLE PLACES WHICH 4 GIVES483 GIVES THE FASCIA THE APPEARANCE OF BEING FASCICULATED ITS EDGES ALL AROUND ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE SKIN AND AT LAST APPEAR TO BE LOST OR TO DEGENERATE INTO THE COMMON CELLULAR MEMBRANE OF THE SKIN IMMEDIATELY UNDER THIS IS ANOTHER MEMBRANE EXACTLY OF THE SAME KIND THE FIBRES OF WHICH IN SOME MEASURE DECUSSATE THOSE OF THE FORMER PASSING FROM THE MIDDLE LINE OF THE BODY OUT WARDS AND BACKWARDS THE INNER EDGE OF THIS IS LOST WITH THE FIRST DESCRIBED THE ANTERIOR OUTER AND POSTERIOR EDGES ARE PARTLY ATTACHED TO THE SEMI CIRCULAR CARTILAGES AND PARTLY LOST IN THE COMMON CELLULAR MEMBRANE THIS INNER FASCIA APPEARS TO BE CONTINUED INTO THE ELECTRIC ORGAN BY SO MANY PROCESSES AND THERE BY MAKES THE MEMBRANOUS SIDES OR SHEATHS OF THE COLUMNS WHICH ARE PRESENTLY TO BE DESCRIBED AND BETWEEN THESE PROCESSES THE FASCIA COVERS THE END OF EACH COLUMN MAKING THE OUTERMOST OR FIRST PARTITION EACH ORGAN OF THE FISH UNDER CONSIDERATION IS ABOUT FIVE INCHES IN LENGTH AND AT THE ANTERIOR END THREE IN BREADTH THOUGH IT IS BUT LITTLE MORE THAN HALF AS BROAD AT THE POSTERIOR EX TREMITY EACH CONSISTS WHOLLY OF PERPENDICULAR COLUMNS REACHING FROM THE UPPER TO THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE BODY AND VARYING IN THEIR LENGTHS ACCORDING TO THE THICKNESS OF THE PARTS OF THE BODY WHERE THEY ARE PLACED THE LONGEST COLUMN BEING ABOUT AN INCH AND AN HALF THE SHORTEST ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF AN INCH IN LENGTH AND THEIR DIAMETERS ABOUT TWO TENTHS OF AN INCH R R R 2 THE484 THE FIGURES OF THE COLUMNS ARE VERY IRREGULAR VARYING ACCORDING TO SITUATION AND OTHER CIRCUM STANCES THE GREATEST NUMBER OF THEM ARE EITHER IRREGULAR HEXAGONS OR IRREGULAR PENTAGONS BUT FROM THE IRREGULARITY OF SOME OF THEM IT HAPPENS THAT A PRETTY REGULAR QUADRANGULAR COLUMN IS SOME TIMES FORMED THOSE OF THE EXTERIOR ROW ARE EI THER QUADRANGULAR OR HEXAGONAL HAVING ONE SIDE EXTERNAL TWO LATERAL AND EITHER ONE OR TWO INTER NAL IN THE SECOND ROW THEY ARE MOSTLY PEN TAGONS THEIR COATS ARE VERY THIN AND SEEM TRANSPARENT CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER HAVING A KIND OF LOOSE NETWORK OF TENDINOUS FIBRES PASSING TRANS VERSELY AND OBLIQUELY BETWEEN THE COLUMNS AND UNITING THEM MORE FIRMLY TOGETHER THESE ARE MOSTLY OBSERVABLE WHERE THE LARGE TRUNKS OF THE NERVES PASS THE COLUMNS ARE ALSO ATTACHED BY STRONG INELASTIC FIBRES PASSING DIRECTLY FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN DIFFERENT TORPEDOS OF THE SIZE OF THAT NOW OFFERED TO THE SOCIETY AP PEARED TO BE ABOUT 470 IN EACH ORGAN BUT THE NUMBER VARIES ACCORDING TO THE SIZE OF THE FISH  THESE COLUMNS INCREASE NOT ONLY IN SIZE BUT IN NUMBER DURING THE GROWTH OF THE ANIMAL NEW ONES FORMING PERHAPS EVERY YEAR ON THE EXTERIOR EDGES AS THERE THEY ARE MUCH THE SMALLEST THIS PROCESS MAY BE SIMILAR TO THE FORMATION OF NEW TEETH IN THE HUMAN JAW AS IT INCREASES  IN A VERY LARGE TORPEDO THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN ONE ELECTRIC ORGAN WERE 1182 3 EACH485 EACH COLUMN IS DIVIDED BY HORIZONTAL PARTITIONS PLACED OVER EACH OTHER AT VERY SMALL DISTANCES AND FORMING NUMEROUS INTERSTICES WHICH APPEAR TO CON TAIN A FLUID THESE PARTITIONS CONSIST OF A VERY THIN MEMBRANE CONSIDERABLY TRANSPARENT THEIR EDGES APPEAR TO BE ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE WHOLE IS ATTACHED BY A FINE CELLULAR MEMBRANE TO THE INSIDE OF THE COLUMNS THEY ARE NOT TOTALLY DETACHED FROM ONE ANOTHER I HAVE FOUND THEM ADHERING AT DIFFE RENT PLACES BY BLOODVESSELS PASSING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER THE NUMBER OF PARTITIONS CONTAINED IN A COLUMN OF ONE INCH IN LENGTH OF A TORPEDO WHICH HAD BEEN PRESERVED IN PROOF SPIRIT APPEARED UPON A CAREFUL EX AMINATION TO BE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THIS NUMBER IN A GIVEN LENGTH OF COLUMN APPEARS TO BE COMMON TO ALL SIZES IN THE SAME STATE OF HUMIDITY FOR BY DRYING THEY MAY BE GREATLY ALTERED WHENCE IT APPEARS PROBABLE THAT THE INCREASE IN THE LENGTH OF A COLUMN DURING THE GROWTH OF THE ANIMAL DOES NOT ENLARGE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH PARTITION IN PRO PORTION TO THAT GROWTH BUT THAT NEW PARTITIONS ARE FORMED AND ADDED TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE COLUMN FROM THE FASCIA THE PARTITIONS ARE VERY VASCULAR THE ARTERIES ARE BRANCHES FROM THE VEINS OF THE GILLS WHICH CONVEY THE BLOOD THAT HAS RECEIVED THE INFLUENCE OF RESPIRA TION THEY PASS ALONG WITH THE NERVES TO THE ELEC TRIC ORGAN AND ENTER WITH THEM THEN THEY RAMIFY IN EVERY DIRECTION INTO INNUMERABLE SMALL BRANCHES UPON THE SIDES OF THE COLUMNS SENDING IN FROM THE CIRCUMFERENCE ALL AROUND UPON EACH PARTITION SMALL ARTERIES486 ARTERIES WHICH RAMIFY AND ANASTOMOSE UPON IT AND PASSING ALSO FROM ONE PARTITION TO ANOTHER ANASTOMOSE WITH THE VESSELS OF THE ADJACENT PARTITIONS THE VEINS OF THE ELECTRIC ORGAN PASS OUT CLOSE TO THE NERVES AND RUN BETWEEN THE GILLS TO THE AURICLE OF THE HEART THE NERVES INSERTED INTO EACH ELECTRIC ORGAN ARISE BY THREE VERY LARGE TRUNKS FROM THE LATERAL AND PO STERIOR PART OF THE BRAIN THE FIRST OF THESE IN ITS PASSAGE OUTWARDS TURNS ROUND A CARTILAGE OF THE CRA NIUM AND SENDS A FEW BRANCHES TO THE FIRST GILL AND TO THE ANTERIOR PART OF THE HEAD AND THEN PASSES INTO THE ORGAN TOWARDS ITS ANTERIOR EXTREMITY THE SECOND TRUNK ENTERS THE GILLS BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND OPENINGS AND AFTER FURNISHING IT WITH SMALL BRANCHES PASSES INTO THE ORGAN NEAR ITS MIDDLE THE THIRD TRUNK AFTER LEAVING THE SKULL DIVIDES ITSELF INTO TWO BRANCHES WHICH PASS TO THE ELECTRIC ORGAN THROUGH THE GILLS ONE BETWEEN THE SECOND AND THIRD OPENINGS THE OTHER BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH GIVING SMALL BRANCHES TO THE GILL ITSELF THESE NERVES HAVING ENTERED THE ORGANS RAMIFY IN EVERY DIRECTION BETWEEN THE COLUMNS AND SEND IN SMALL BRANCHES UPON EACH PARTITION WHERE THEY ARE LOST THE MAGNITUDE AND THE NUMBER OF THE NERVES BESTOWED ON THESE ORGANS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SIZE MUST ON REFLECTION APPEAR AS EXTRAORDINARY AS THE PHAENOMENA THEY AFFORD NERVES ARE GIVEN TO PARTS EITHER FOR SENSATION OR ACTION NOW IF WE EX CEPT THE MORE IMPORTANT SENSES OF SEEING HEARING SMELLING AND TASTING WHICH DO NOT BELONG TO THE ELECTRIC ORGANS THERE IS NO PART EVEN OF THE MOST PERFECT ANIMAL WHICH IN PROPORTION TO ITS SIZE IS SO487 SO LIBERALLY SUPPLIED WITH NERVES NOR DO THE NERVES SEEM NECESSARY FOR ANY SENSATION WHICH CAN BE SUP POSED TO BELONG TO THE ELECTRIC ORGANS AND WITH RESPECT TO ACTION THERE IS NO PART OF ANY ANIMAL WITH WHICH I AM ACQUAINTED HOWEVER STRONG AND CONSTANT ITS NATURAL ACTIONS MAY BE WHICH HAS SO GREAT A PROPORTION OF NERVES IF IT BE THEN PROBABLE THAT THOSE NERVES ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSES OF SENSATION OR ACTION MAY WE NOT CONCLUDE THAT THEY ARE SUBSERVIENT TO THE FORMATION COLLECTION OR MANAGEMENT OF THE ELECTRIC FLUID ESPECIALLY AS IT APPEARS EVIDENT FROM MR WALSHS EXPERIMENTS THAT THE WILL OF THE ANI MAL DOES ABSOLUTELY CONTROUL THE ELECTRIC POWERS OF ITS BODY WHICH MUST DEPEND ON THE ENERGY OF THE NERVES HOW FAR THIS MAY BE CONNECTED WITH THE POWER OF THE NERVES IN GENERAL OR HOW FAR IT MAY LEAD TO AN EXPLANATION OF THEIR OPERATIONS TIME AND FUTURE DISCOVERIES ALONE CAN FULLY DETERMINE AN488 AN E X P L A N A T I O N OF THE ENGRAVING OF THE T O R P E D

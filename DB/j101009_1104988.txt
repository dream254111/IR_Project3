cents All Communications should be addressed to the PUBLISHERS The dual nature of our government and the complications that arise therefrom present strange questions which only the high est tribunal in the land can answer How far A Curious the general government can bind the States as Complication to their internal affairs by treaties with for eign powers is one question which has never been answered though many attempts have been made to do so Treaties under the Constitution are classed with the supreme laws of the land and one school of lawyers has held that no law of any state can nullify any part of a treaty made by the general government The question is quite acute now in view of the California laws as to aliens holding landthese laws being aimed at the Japanese with whom we have a treaty which seems to permit such holding by people of that nation We do not propose to argue the question one way or another but to express wonder that a question of this character has never reached the Supreme Court of the United States But a more serious question just now presents itself on the Texas border Suppose Governor Colquitt carries out a veiled threat he has made more than once and sends his Texas Rangers across the Mexican border and captures or shoots a few federal or rebel Mexican troopers Is this an act of war on the part of our government The State of Texas is an integral part of the Union but has no power to declare war What can the general government do It can of course disclaim the act of the State and offer redress What sort of redress To deliver the guilty rangers to the Mexican government as murderers in case a few greasers are killed The country would be up in arms against such a suggestion and Texas would rebel against it Of course the general government could offer a monetary redress as it did in the case of the Italians killed in the antiItalian riots in New Orleans But suppose Mexico refused the indemnity and demanded the persons of the slayers as this government would do in a similar case Texas would protect them The strong arm of this government would call out first the marshals of the United States courts then the army and civil war would be the result unless one side or the other surrendered Public sen timent would undoubtedly be on the side of the State and every wellthinking man would revolt at the idea of delivering our cit izens to a semibarbarous crowd to be put to death beyond the peradventure of a doubt even though they had been guilty of a grave breach of international law What remedy can be sug gested to legally prevent such action on the part of a State gov ernment We confess our inability to even guess at an answer Can any one aid to enlighten our ignorance The Supreme Court of the United States one or more of whose members are of the Roman Catholic persuasion are faced with a question which for many centuries Old Foes in New gave rise to innumerable troubles and pro Places and with duced statute after statute But the point New Faces to be decided is to be decided upon a theory of law which the parliaments passing the va rious Statutes of Mortmain never considered i e public pol icy It is true these statutes were passed because then as now the things complained of were against the good of the state but public policy was an unknown term in those days The ques tion is whether the vows of the Roman Catholic Order of St Benedict which pledge a man to poverty and which practically amount to the assignment of his entire estate over to that order are valid or not and whether after the death of a member of that order his next of kin or his Order are entitled to his estate A BenedictineFather Wirthdied at Springfield Minn His property consisting of income from books he had written was claimed by the Benedictine Order by virtue of the vows which he had taken pledging himself to poverty and agreeing that the order should possess all of his property A niece and nephew contended that they were entitled to the estate of the deceased monk because the courts could not enforce such vows as against 1914 949 EDITORIAL19 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER public policy The attorneys for the Order claim that the Order is a vast charitable organization and point to its achievements as showing that it is not against public policy We have not seen the record and do not know whether the monk made a deed of gift to his Order or simply took vows the effect of which was to bind him to turn over all of his earnings to it In the first casecertainly in Virginiasuch an assign ment to such an organization would not be good and we cannot see how any property could pass by a mere vow especially when the vower died intestate But the Roman Catholic members of the Court are faced by their religious views on one sidethese Orders being held to be of great usefulness to the Church and in the salvation of mens souls and such vows being recognized and indeed approved by the Supreme Pontiff whose infallible pronunciamento has pro nounced the vows absolutely binding and therefore not against public policy from the churchs standpoint As good Catholics they are bound to regard these vows as binding on those who take them to the last and fullest extent But what are they to say when on a fair argument from the strictly legal standpoint they appear to be from the mere civil standpoint absolutely void  Is the law of churchwhich to a good Roman Catholic is the law of Godto prevail or their law which under their oaths they are sworn to see carried out to override the law of God It is an awkward dilemma WAe shall await the decision in the case with much interest That the law as construed by courts is very elastic we have never had occasion to doubt but in a recent English decision it does seem to us to have been stretched Telephonic Trespass well nigh to the limit And yet our sympathy is absolutely with the court in its opinion and we hail it with an approval which we fear is en tirely selfish For if we could sue for damages every person who worries us over the telephone if we could amerce in a good round sum the hello girl who rings us up at midnight and brings us down two flights of stairs in the cold winter clad in our trailing 950  Aprilgarments of the night to announce she had given the wrong number our soul would be satisfied In the case of Standard Developments Lim v Collins de cided in February in the Lambeth England County Court Judge Parry held that one who continually rang up another at that others employers office urging him to sign a promissory note was guilty of an electical trespass It is true this was 4obiter as the case went off on another point but commenting upon the case the London Law Journal says To ring the telephone bell at another persons house in order to put pressure on some person employed there is not only a most offensive thing to do but an insufferable trespass for which no doubt substantial damages could be recovered by the owner in a proper suit The wrong of trespass to a mans house or land trcs pass quare clausum fregit may be committed by any form of entry the slightest crossing of the boundary is sufficient as for instance the putting of a hand through a window or the sitting upon a fence That is old law and in a modern case Gregory v Piper 1829 it was laid down that it is not es sential that there should be any crossing of the boundary at all if there is some physical contact with the aggrieved per sons landif a single stone is wrongfully laid by a man against his neighbours wall it is a trespass And what is true of land or houses applies equally to chattels a wrong is committed if there is without lawful justification any di rect physical interference with a chattel inthe possession of another person Physical interference usually consists in some form of physical contact and a trespass to chattels is actionable per se without proof of actual damage So any unauthorized touching or moving of a chattel is actionable at the suit of its possessor even though no harm ensues One who had not examined the books would be surprised to know the number of cases which have been before the courts upon the question of a landlords liability of Landlord for liability for injuries sustained by Defective Stairways persons on staircases of flats or tenement dwellings and the some what hazy condition of the law on the subject The leading case 1914  951 EDITORIAL19 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER in England is Miller v Hancock 2 Q B 177 decided in 1893 in which a landlord was held liable for injuries to a person who had business with the tenant of a flat owned by the landlord the stair way of which was defective and who was hurt by a fall caused by this defect which amounted to a trap This decision was questioned by the very court which decided it in Huggett v Miers 2 K B 278 decided in 1908 and held practically to have been decided upon the special circumstances of the case and the landlord was exonerated in the latter case because the circum stances indicated that the tenants should have lighted the stair case not the landlordlack of light causing the accident Two later casesMellon v Henderson and Kennedy v Shoth Iron Co decided in the Court of Session in Scotland in 1913 held the landlord liable for falls caused by defective staircases because the lefects amounted to a trap But in England two recent cases acquitted the landlord In one caseDobson v Horseley 30 T L R 148 because there was no proof that the landlord had knowledge of the defect and in the otherLucy v Bowdenas yet only reported in the newspapersbecause the injured party did know of the defect and had complained of it The London Law Journal in summing up the numerous decisions seems to think the law is that the landlord is bound to furnish a reasonably safe staircase or other means of approach if such means of approach are under his controlthe usual case in tene ment houses He is liable for all defects of repair unless the danger is apparent to everybody But he is not bound to provide a staircase up or down which no one could possibly fall or by the misuse of which by somebody else a person using it could not be hurt These decisions of course are not in accordance with the Com mon Law which required a covenant on the part of the landlord to make him liable in such cases but the American authorities are all in accord with the English law It is rather curious but no case has ever arisen in Virginia as to the landlords liability for failure to keep that part of the building over which he has control in repair WVe suppose one reason is that the flat or tene ment house is a comparatively new thing in this State of Homes 952  AprilWhen this number reaches our readers the General Assembly of 1914 will have adjourned An inspection of its work up to three days of its adjournment fills the Whats the Remedy patriotic citizen with a feeling of bitter disappointment There were so many valuable laws which should have been enacted which failed and so many of the merest local nature which took up much time passed The Enabling Act consumed a vast deal of valuable time which might have been better employed The Red Light Dis trict Bill which failed of passage consumed much time which might have been used for far more important matters Law Re form amendment of patently defective laws went by the board Twothirdswe might safely say ninetenthsof the laws en acted were as to matters of mere local concern with which the General Assemblys limited time ought not to be consumed Why should not the charters of municipal corporations be amended or changed by the Corporation Commission Why should not counties and cities be allowed to borrow money by a general law passed under  65 of Article IV of the Constitution conferring upon boards of supervisors counties and councils of cities or towns powers of general or special legislation Section 127 of Article VIII amply protects this power from abuse as to cities The counties could be protected by a law of similar character To illustrate the point we are making that much of the legisla tion now taking up the time of the General Assembly might be by some wise law relegated to a different tribunal and taken care of nearer home we give the following list of bills which were passed at one days session and in the passage of which necessarily much time was consumed No 94To amend the act concerning the Bureau of Insurance and insurance guaranty trust indemnity fidelity security and fraternal benefit companies associations societies and orders

intellects to work and try to have some remedy to conserve the time of the Gen eral Assembly now entirely too short and have some of the measures of this character taken care of in some different way even if it required a Constitutional amendment to do it If in addition to this we could only keep the ministerial and other lobbies away from the General Assembly for one session and remember that sumptuary laws are not wise legislation we might cure some of the crying evils which are clogging the wheels of justice and costing the State and the private citizen untold dol lars and causing gross injustice  April 956

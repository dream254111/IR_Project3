by James B Dill Fourth Edition 8vo pp xxxii 580 New York Baker Voorhis  Co 1902 Unlike Judge Noyess work reviewed below showing how far corporate combinations can be or ought to be permitted this shows how far they have gone in the state which has been not inaptly described as the home of the trusts This is the fourth edition the first appeared in 1898 the second in 1899 and the third in 1901 of this most important work by the author of the law under which most of the great industrial combinations of the last five years have been formed It is prepared by one that knows how it is done and is down to date in every particular There seems to be no necessity for commendation for the profession has evidently realized its value and seized it with avidity This edition will be found much more valuable than the sec ond or third This has 540 pages of text the third 352 and the second 324 This contains 375 corporate precedents the third 242 and the second only 190 The later legislation of New Jersey and the decisions of the courts of that state are inserted in their proper places and brought down to dateseveral cases not yet reported are given and the very important one of Berger v U S Steel Corporation by the N J Court of Errors and Appeals filed Octo ber 11 1902 is reported in full on page 198 The text proper of the work consists of the constitutional and statutory provisions of the New Jersey law of 1896 with the amendments since given in their regular order with full annotations from the New Jersey decisions and those of other states where the statutory provisions are the same This part of the work in itself forms a most valuable treatise on corporation law as it exists in the state that has had the most liberal and consistently and competently worked out corporate policy extending over a series of years of any state of the Union This is the only state that seems yet to have consistently and adequately worked out a cor porate policy that compares at all with the care that has been given to the subject in England the New Jersey policy however is much more liberal than the English and whatever one may think of the policy one must com mend the manner in which it has been formulated amended and applied through the hands of experts continually following a definite plan and policy instead of being a mere hotchpotch of inconsistent unconnected provisions often without plan and frequently with as little sense In many ways the most valuable part of this work will be found to be that devoted to Corporation Precedents in which it is remarkably full giving actual demonstrations of the corporate problem as worked out by the most 242

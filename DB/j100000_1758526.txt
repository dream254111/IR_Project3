facts I translate the following history which I am sure will be accepted as true by every geologist who has had sufficient experience in fieldwork to make his judgment of such phenomena trustworthy I At the beginning of the formation of the coalmeasures northeastern Ohio was a land surface underlain by the Waverley shales or beds of gravel now the conglomerate This surface was furrowed by the valleys of streams and pitted by local basins similar to those which mark the present surface II With a slow subsidence which con tinued with interruptions throughout the coal measure epoch the drainage was checked and lakes and marshes were formed in the depres sions of the surface In these basins a fine sediment was deposited the fireclay like the clay now found under some of our peatbeds When overgrown with vegetation the roots of plants penetrating this silt drew out of it iron potash soda etc leaving it nearly pure silicate of alumina and specially refractory whence its uses and name III The marshes and lakes were ultimately filled with peat which rose to a general level near the waterline and was sometimes thirty or forty feet deep in the deepest parts of the basins IV In places waterbasins remained such through a considerable portion of the time occupied in the accumulation of the peat and sluggish streams flowed through the marshes connecting these basins and transporting to them fine sand clay lime iron etc which mingling with the completely macerated vege table tissue formed cannel coal blackband ironore and bituminous shale After a time these basins also were filled with peat growing from the margins just as our lakelets are now filled and converted into peatmarshes V After ages had passed with the physical conditions described a subsidence caused a submergence of the peatmarshes which first resulted in the destruction of the generation of growing plants that covered them These dropped in succession leaves twigs and branches and finally most of the standing trees fell Some however continued longer to maintain an upright position while the fine argillaceous sediment suspended in the water was slowly deposited around them to form the roof shale of which the lower layers are charged with the debris of the plants growing on the marsh the upper layers deposited NCE 91 when these were all buried nearly barren of fossils VI The weight of the superincumbent mass pressed down the bed of peat which consoli dated by that process and undergoing internal chemical changes ultimately became a bed of coal thickest in the deepest part of each basin thinning and rising on each side up to its edge which remains to mark the original level of the surface of the peatmarsh Thus and in no other conceivable way was the resulting coalbed made six feet thick in the bottom of the basin and running out to nothing on the sides thirty or forty feet higher The whole anatomy of the coalseam shows that it was formed where it is found the erect trees and plantbearing shale above the rootpenetrated fireclay below the small amount of ash only the inorganic matter of the plants with many other features it pre sents making the theory that it has been trans ported untenable J S NEWBERRY THE YALE OBSERVATORY HELIOMETER FOR the benefit of the nonastronomical reader whose heliometric ideas are vague the instrument may be defined as a measuringma chine in which the images of two stars or other celestial objects to be measured are super posed in the telescopic field by the following method a telescope objectglass is cut across one of its diameters ar the two halves thus formed can be move in opposite directions along the line of section by the observer while looking threaugh the eyepiece If he were examining the sun for instance with the two halves of the objectglass together then he would have an ordinary telescopic view of the sun but let him separate them and he has the effect produced in the sextant when the two suns images are separated by moving the arm Now if he brings the two images tan gent first on one side and then on the opposite side by passing one over the other the dis tance the objectglass halves are moved can evidently be expressed in arc when the focal length is known and is a measure of the suns angular diameter The advantages of such a method of measurement are only to be fully appreciated from certain considerations in physiological optics from which it seems to be established that the most accurate measure ments by direct vision are to be expected when the measuringscale and the object meas ured are precisely similar in appearance and92 SCIE can be symmetrically placed In the case given the suns limbs are of the same color and form and the two positions are symmet rical with reference to each other In measur ing stars the apparent magnitudes being made approximately equal their images may be made to pass over each other with the greatest nicety and in both these cases the observers eye is steadily directed to a definite point in the tele scopic field In practice this seems to give more precise results than when the observers attention is directed to two points at some dis tance from each other and both bisected by the webs of the ordinary micrometer In the telescope with such a micrometer the most exact measurements are not often extended over a minute of arc And this limit is fixed by the field of view which decreases as the magnifying power increases With the heliom eter however the limit of the distance which can be measured is independent of the mag nifying power and the field of view but is limited by the amount of motion given to the two halves of the objectglass In the Yale heliometer this motion is about two degrees Another advantage is the absence of either the bright webs or the bright field of the ordinary micrometer but this is counterbalanced to some extent by the necessity of making the heliometer objectglass smaller than is usual in equatorials The difficulties and expense of construction of the modern heliometer the fact that it is a special instrument to be devoted to measuring rather than to viewing and the less difficulty of manipulation of meridian instruments and equatorials led to the comparative neglect of the heliometer by Englishspeaking people un til the erection of the Oxford heliometer of 190 mm aperture Lord Lindsays admirable volume Dun Echdit obspubl vol ii describ ing his heliometer of 107 mm aperture pre seiced in a very forcible manner the precision attained in measurements with comparatively small instruments An inspection of the meas urements executed with the instruments at Breslau 76 mm aperture K6nigsberg 158 mm Bonn 162 mm and Strasburg 76 mm shows a precision for distances over 1 minute not equalled by any other measure ments made at the same period by instruments of another class The belief that a heliometer of the largest size and built according to the most recent theories as to material form and symmetrical arrangement of parts would be an important adjunct to the instrumental resources of Amer ican astronomy led to the writers recommend NZCE voL I No 4 ing to the Yale observatory board the acquisi tion of such an instrument The contract with the Messrs Repsold bears the date of June 11 1880 The heliometer was erected in Repsolds shops in January 1882 for inspection and arrived in New York the following May About the beginning of September it was in place in the west tower of the observatory The figure shows it as erected in Repsolds shop at Hamburg and without its tripod foot The objectglass is mounted in the rectangular metal frame A which contains the two sliding pieces holding the objectglass halves which rest on four cylindrical surfaces each 107 x 13 mm and having a radius 125 mm less than the focal length of the objectglass The large rotating disc B contains three sectors of differ ent thicknesses of wire gauze which can be swung over either objectglass half to diminish the apparent brightness of either image This whole head can be rotated in position angle by means of the shallow sheetiron cylinder which has a rack with its appropriate gearing attached to it By this device the motion in position angle is as expeditious as in the common form of position micrometer The position circle is at P The slow motions and clamps for all the circles are brought within easy reach of the eye piece E by a number of ingenious mechanical devices The two small brass oillamps which are carried at the extremities of long arms to avoid their heating effects on the instrument by a careful economy of the light and a beautiful arrangement of lenses and mirrors illuminate the objectglass platinum scales the scale me tallic thermometer and both the position and declination circle indices which are all read by their appropriate microscope micrometers pro jecting from within the cylinder C The tele scope tube is of steel the circle graduations are on silver the column axes and counter poises are of iron and rest upon a massive tripod foot of 085 m radius The distance from the surface of the granite capstone on which the tripod foot rests to the intersection of the polar and declination axis is 29 m The clockwork with its connecting rod is shown at D The more important instrumental constants are as follows aperture 155 mm focal length 2495 mm maximum arc to be measured 2 magnifying power of the eyepieces 90 126 159 245 The scale micrometer has a value of 025 for one division of its head while the hour circle declination circle and position cir cle micrometer divisions have values of 1 10      JiJMWOM1JraH 2UJOIVAaUsao aIVYA aIm I 0 ar r Gt I Y 324ORIV94 S CIE and 10 respectively The aperture of the finder is 62 mm The whole instrument is an exquisite piece of mechanical workmanship and for both design and execution the makers are entitled to the highest praise The construction of the objectglass first of fered to the Clarks but declined by them be cause of the subsequent cutting in two was accomplished by Merz of Munich Its per formance using the Steinheil achromatic eye pieces is an agreeable surprise With either half the images are as sharp as with a good fourinch telescope With the images super posed there is a loss of the best definition and this arises from the practical impossibility of adjusting the two halves of such an object glass so that the images will be absolutely superposed In actual observing the greatest difficulty in the way of exact measurement is found in a want of similarity in the atmos pheric conditions affecting two celestial ob jects which are supposably near enough to be influenced alike Thus the two opposite limbs of the sun except in the very best observing weather do not maintain a steady contact together when heliometrically observed but vi brate alternately lapping over and receding from each other In the observations of the last transit of Venus this peculiarity presented the curious effect of a rapid breaking and form ing of a ligament analogous to the  black drop described by the older observers when the limbs of Venus and the sun were in contact The model on which the whole instrument is constructed is a very great improvement on any previous heliometer so far as lessening the observers fatigue is concerned Every motion is controlled and every scale and cir cle is read by the observer without leaving his seat With the cylindical bearings of the object glass cells the image distortion for measures up to 2 is rendered extremely small by the rapid rotation in position angle and equal rapidity in distance settings the observer is no longer fatigued by manipulation and it can be said that in this instrument the heliometer shows itself to be a measuringmachine of the highest precision LEONARD WALDO NOTE ON THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE TRANSIT OF VENUS 1882 AT THE LICK OBSER VA TORY BY invitation of Capt R S Floyd presi dent of the trustees of the James Lick trust I went to Mount Hamilton to direct the obser vations of the transit of Venus at the Lick NCE VOL I No 4 Observatory The chief instrument of the equipment which the trustees had provided in time for observing the transit was the horizon tal photoheliograph which is essentially simi lar to those employed by the American com mission on the occasion of the transit of 1874 as well as that of 1882 and which are described by Professor Newcomb in the first part of the American observations of the transit of Venus of 1874 The Lick photoheliograph like all the others has an objective five inches in diam eter and its focal length is almost exactly forty feet The heliostat mirror an unsilvered disk of glass is seven inches in diameter and was mounted on a pier adjacent to that which supported the objective A third pier coming up in the interior of the photographic house supported the plateholder and all three piers were laid up of brick their foundation being in the rock of the mountain summit I arrived at the observatory in the evening of Nov 21 The photoheliograph had in the main been mounted and got in readiness before that time by Mr Fraser the superintendent of construction of the observatory It re mained to complete the unfinished portions of the instrument to mount and fully adjust the same to modify some details which had been unsuitably constructed and to make sure of the convenient and effective working of every part Especial attention was given to the accurate determination of the position of the focal plane of the objective and the method adopted being nothing short of a critical examination by many persons independently of several sets of trialplates exposed at vary ing distances from the objective finally indi cated the true setting of the plateholder with much more than the required precision Great care was taken to insure the perfect definition and figure of all the pictures and to prevent the mishap of fogged plates from scattering and extraneous light Much time was consumed in this way in the preparatory work but we had more than sufficient compensation in the superior character of the photographs of Venus in transit All these were taken by the wet process and the photographic operations were in charge of Mr Lovell of Amherst During the important days of the transit period the meteorological conditions on Mount Hamilton were especially favorable At mid night Nov 30 the sky cleared after three and a half days of continuously cloudy weath er From that time until the afternoon of Dec 7 we saw no cloud day nor night which could in the least interfere with any observa tion we had to make Thin cirrus was float

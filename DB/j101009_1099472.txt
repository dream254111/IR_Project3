THAT SUCH EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGE MUST GIVE WAY WHEN IT INTERFERES WITH PUBLIC CONVENIENCE THE FIRST CASE REPORTED BELOW WAS DISPOSED OF IN THE MAYORS COURT OF LYNCH BURGTHE OPINION WHICH WE PRINT BEINIG DELIVERED BY MAYOR SMITH THE SECOND CASE REPORTED WAS DECIDED BY JUDGE GEORGE W MORRIS OF THE COR PORATION COURT OF CHARLOTTESVILLE NO WRITTEN OPINION WAS DELIVERED BUT OUR REPORT OF THE CASE FULLY DISCLOSES THE GROUNDS UPON WLHICH THE DECISION WAS RESTED WVINGO V N1O6FOIK  VESTERN RAILROAD COMPANYOPINION BY MAYOR G W SMITH THIS IS A WARRANT SWORN OUT BY R E WINGO AGAINST THE NORFOLK AIND WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY CHARGING IT WITH VIOLATING SECTION 3 OF AN ACT REGULATING COM MON CARRIERS APPROVED MARCH 3 1892 BY GIVING AN UNDUE PREFERENCE TO THE LYNCH BURG TRANSFER COMPANY BY LEASING IT THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO SOLICIT BAGGAGE AT THE UNIOTN STATION IN THE CITY OF LYNCHBURG THE PROPERTY OF THE NORFOLK  WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY THE STATUTE IN QUESTION HAS BEEN CONSTRUED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS IN THE RECENT CASE OF THE NORFOLK  WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY V THE OLD DOMINION BAGGAGE COMPANY DECIDED ON THE 17TH OF MARCH 1901 6 VA LAW REG 693 THE OBJECT OF WHICH SUIT WAS TO RESTRAIN THE NORFOLK  WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY FROM GIVING THE LYNCHBURG TRANSFER COMPANY THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO ENTER ITS STATION PROPERTY AND SOLICIT BAGGAGE ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS AN UNDUE PREFERENCE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ABOVE STATUTE AND WAS THEREFORE CONDEMNED BY IT THE DE444 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER OCT CISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS WAS IN FAVOR OF THE RAILWAY COMPANY THE COURT HOLDING THAT THE ACT WAS INTENDED TO PREVENT A SUBSTANTIAL INJURY OR INCONVENIENCE TO THE PUBLIC THAT THE MERE FACT THAT ONE BAGGAGE COMPANY WAS ALLOWED TO SOLICIT BAGGAGE ON THE COMPANYS PROPERTY WHILE THE PRIVILEGE WAS DENIED TO ANOTHER DID NOT IN ITSELF CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE ACT BUT THAT IT MUST APPEAR ON THE COM PLAINT OF THOSE WHO USE THE RAILWAY THAT THE ACTION OF THE RAILWAY COMPANY IN GRANTING THIS EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGE WAS SO UNREASONABLE AS TO RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL INCONVENIENCE TO THE PUBLIC IN WHICH EVENT THE CONTRACT WOULD BE SET ASIDE IN DECIDING THE CASE BEFORE ME THEREFORE IT IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT GIVEN TO THE LYCHBURG TRANSFER COMPANY TO SOLICIT BAGGAGE ON THE COMPANYS PROPERTY WORKS A SUBSTANTIAL INCONVENIENCE TO THE PUBLIC IT IS NOT CHARGED IN THE COMPLAINT NOR IS IT CONTENDED THAT ANY PERSON OR FIRM HAS BEEN PREVENTED IN ANY WAY FROM DELIVERING OR RECEIVING BAGGAGE AT THE STATION FOR THE TRAVELING PUBLIC THE SOLE GROUND OF COMPLAINT IS THAT THE NORFOLK  WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANV HAS GIVEN THE LYNCHBURG TRANSFER COMPANY THE EX CLUSIVE RIGHT TO COME ON ITS PROPERTY AND SOLICIT BAGGAGE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE RAILWAY COMPANY BY GIVING THIS EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGE HAS VIOLATED THE STATUTE IN QUESTION IT APPEARED IN THE EVIDENCE THAT THE CONTRACT WITH THE TRANSFER COMPANY WAS MADE ON THE 15TH OF MARCH 1901 AND IS TO CONTINUE FOR ONE YEAR THAT THE TRANS FER COMPANY IS GIVEN THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO ENTER THE STATION PROPERTY OF THE NOR FOLK  WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SOLICITING BAGGAGE FROM INCOMING PASSENGERS THAT IT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO MLEET ALL TRAINS AND DELIVER BAGGAGE AT ANY POINT IN THE CITY OR TO CALL AT ANY POINT IN THE CITY AND RECEIVE BAGGAGE AND DELIVER IT TO ANY TRAIN AT A CHARGE NOT TO EXCEED TWENTYFIVE CENTS FOR TRUNKS AND TEN CENTS FOR VALISES AND IN ADLDITION IT IS REQUIRED TO MEET ALL TRAINS WITH AN ADE QUATE NUMBER OF HACKS AND CARRY PASSENGERS TO ANY POINT IN THE CITY OR TO CALL WITH A HACK AT ANY POINT IN THE CITY AND CARRY A PASSENGER TO ANY TRAIN AT A PRICE NOT TO EXCEED TWENTYFIVE CENTS FOR EACH PASSENGER THE BAGGAGE COMPANY FURTHER AGREED TO PAV THE NORFOLK  WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY A MONEY CONSIDERATION IN RETURN FOR THIS EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGE OF SOLICITING BAGGAGE ON ITS PROPERTY IT FURTHER AP PEARED IN EVIDENCE THAT MR WINGO IS CONDUCTING A TRANSFER BUSINESS UNDER THE STYLE OF THE HILL CITY TRANSFER COMPANY IN COMPETITION WITH THE LYNCHBURG TRANSFER COMPANY AND THAT HE IS COMPELLED TO SOLICIT BAGGAGE AT THE HEAD OF THE STEPS LEADING DP FROM THE DEPOT AND THAT HIS RATES FOR HAULING BAGGAGE DO NOT EX CEED FIFTEEN CENTS IT WAS CONTENDED THAT THE FACT THAT HE COULD NOT COME UPON THE COMPANYS PROPERTY AND SOLICIT BAGGAGE WORKED A SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC INCONVENI ENCE IN THAT IT COMPELLED A PASSENGER IF HE WISHED TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE FIFTEEN CENT RATE TO GO UP THE FLIGHT OF STEPS AT THE STATION TO EMPLOY MR WINGO OR HIS AGENTS CONCEDING FOR THE SAKE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT MR WINGO IS ENTITLED TO MAKE THIS COMPLAINT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME THAT IN THE LIGHT OF THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS THE CONTRACT COMPLAINED OF CAN BE SAID TO WORK A ASUBSTANTIAL INCONVENIIENCE TO THE PUIBLIC IF A PASSENGER WISHES TO SAVE TEN CENTS IN THE HAUL ING OF HIS BAGGAGE HE CAN DO SO BY GOING TO THE LHEAD OF T HE STEPS WHICH IS NEAR BY AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STATION MR WINGO AND EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO THE STATION PROPERTY FOR THE DELIVERY OF OR THE REMOVAL OF BAG GAGE OR FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE EXCEPT THE SOLICITING OF BAGGAGE FROM INCOMING TRAINS IF PASSENGERS DO NOT OBJECT TO PAYING TWENTYFIVE CENTS FOR THE DELIVERY OF1901 MISCELLANY 445 THEIR BAGGAGE THERE ARE AGENTS IMMEDIATELY AT HAND READY TO RECEIVE IT AND IF THEY PREFER TO EMPLOY MR WINGO OR ANYBODY ELSE AT A LOWER RATE THAN TWENTYFIVE CENTS THEY CAN DO SO BY GOING TO THE HEAD OF THE STEPS IN QUESTION FOR THAT PURPOSE MY FEELINGS AND JUDGMENT ARE AGAINST ANY CONTRACT OR COMBINATION WHICH CON STITUTES A MONOPOLY BUT I DO NOT THINK IN VIEW OF THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS I WOULD BE JUSTIFIED IN HOLDING THE CONTRACT IN THIS CASE VOID IT MAY BE SOME INCONVENIENCE IN INDIVIDUAL CASES TO GO TO THE HEAD OF THE STEPS AT THE STA TION TO EMPLOY MR WINGO BUT THIS CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO CONSTITUTE A SUBSTANTIAL INCONVENIENCE TO THE PUBLIC WHICH IS NECESSARY TO THE GRANTING OF THE RELIEF ASKED FOR IF HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE MADE TO APPEAR AT ANY FUTURE TIME THAT THIS CON TRACT IN THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS CARRIED OUT WAS SO UNREASONABLE AS TO RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL INCONVENIENCE TO THE PUBLIC I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO CONDEMN IT COUNSEL FOR MR WINGO RELIED WITH GREAT EARNESTNESS ON THE BRIEF OF THE ATTOR NEYS FOR THE OLD DOMINION TRANSFER COMPANY IN THE COURT OF APPEALS BUT AS THE UNANIMOUS DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS WAS AGAINST THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THAT BRIEF IT CANNOT BE RECEIVED AS AUTHORITY IN THIS COUIRT THE WARRANT MUST

JUDGMENT OF THE POLICE JUSTICE IMPOSING A FINE FOR TRESPASS UPON THE RAILROAD PROPERTY OF THE SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY UNDER AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE THE FACTS DEVELOPED IN THE TRIAL OF THE CASE WERE AS FOLLOWS FOR YEARS PAST THE BAGGAGE DELIVERY AND TRANSFER BUSINESS IN AND ADJACENT TO THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE HAD BEEN IN THE HANDS OF EIGHT OR TEN COLORED MEN WITH WAGONS LICENSED BY THE CITY IN SEPTEMNBER 1900 THE SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT WITH ELDRIDGE TURNER AND W T CLOUD CALLING THEMSELVES THE CHARLOTTESVILLE AND UNIVERSITY TRANSFER COMPANY WHEREBY THEY WERE GIVEN CERTAIN RIGHTS OF SOLICITING ON TRAINS AND IN ORDER TO DO SO OF RIDING BETWEEN STATIONS BUT GIVING THEM NO EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGE OF ENTRANCE TO AND SOLICITING AT STATIONS EARLY IN SEPTEMBER 1901 IT WAS ALLEGED THIS CONTRACT WAS TRANSFERRED TO ONE A C MITCHELL THOUGH NO WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF SUCH TRANSFER OR OF ANY OBLI GATION ASSUMED BY MITCHELL WAS PRODIUCED AT THE TRIAL A DAY OR TWO PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 13 1901 Z L DAMERON A POLICEMAN OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE EMPLOYED AT THE SOUTHERN RAILWAY DEPOT AND IN PART PAID BY THE SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY ACTING UNDER WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY WHICH WERE IN EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL WARNED ALL OF THE NEGRO BAGGAGE MEN THAT THEY WOULD NO LONGER BE PERMITTED TO COME UPON THE PROPERTY OF THE RAILWAY COMPANY EXCEPT WHEN IN THE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF A CLHECK FOR BAGGAGE AND THAT THEN THEY MUST GO DIRECTLY TO THE BAGGAGEROOM AND GET THE BAGGAGE ANID GO AWAY AND THAT IN SOLICITING TRADE THEY MUST COME NO NEARER THAN THE PUBLIC STREET WHICH AS APPEARED IN EVIDENCE WAS FULLY FIFTY FEET FROM THE STATION AND NOT IN THE PATHWAY OF PASSENGERS WHO DEPARTED BY VEHICLE THAT ON AND AFTER THAT DATE ONLY THE CHARLOTTESVILLE AND UNIVERSITY TRANSFER COMPANYS AGENTS WOULD BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE STATION PROPERTY TO SOLICIT BUSINESS THE BAG GAGE MEN DISOBEYED THIS WARNING AND FIVE OF THEM WERE ARRESTED UNDER WRRRANTS446 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER OCT ISSUED BY THE POLICE JUSTICE FOR TRESPASSING UPON THE  RAILROAD PROPERTY OF THE SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY THE WARRANTS WERE ISSUED UNDER A CITY ORDINANCE FOUR CASES WERE DISMISSED BY THE JUSTICE AND IN THE FIFTH THAT OF SHEPHERD A FINE WAS IMPOSED THIS CASE WAS THEN APPEALED IN ADDITION TO THE FACTS STATED ABOVE IT APPEARED AT THE TRIAL THAT THE CHARLOTTES VILLE AND UNIVERSITY TRANSFER COMPANY HAD AND PAID LICENSE ON ONLY ONE WAGON THAT JUST AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND SCHOOLBOYS AND SCHOOL GIRLS WERE COMING IN TO CHARLOTTESVILLE BV THE HUNDRED AND THAT ALL OF THE WAGONS OF ALL OF THE BAGGAGE MEN WERE IN USE UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT IN DELIVERING BAG GAGE THAT THE CONTRACT OF THE CHARLOTTESVILLE AND UNIVERSITY TRANSFER COMPANIY OBLIGATED THEM TO DELIVER BAGGAGE WITLHIN BUT NIOT OUTSIDE OF CITY LIMITS THOUGH AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY DID DELIVER OUTSIDE AND THAT A VERY LARGE PART OF THE BAGGAGE ARRIVING WAS FOR DELIVERY OUTSIDE OF THE CITY THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE BAGGAGE BUSINESS HAD NOT BEEN CONDUCTED THERETOFORE BY THE NEGRO BAGGAGE MEN IN AN ORDERLY AND SATISFACTORY MANNER THE COURT IN RENDERING ITS DECISION STATED THAT IT FELT CONSTRAINED OF COURSE TO FOLLOW THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN THE CASE OF THE NORFOLK  WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY V OLD DOMINION BAGGAGE COMPANY IN CONSTRUINIG THE ACT OF 18912 PROVIDING AGAINST  ANY UNDUE OR UNREASONABLE PREFERENCE OR ADVANTAGE ETC BEING GIVEN BY A COMMON CARRIER THOUGH BUT FOR THAT CASE IT WOULD HAVE CONSTRUED THAT STATUTE DIFFERENTLY AND FOR THE REASON THAT ITS INTENT SEEMS PLAIN IN ITS LANGUAGE WITHOUT READING INTO IT THE DECISIONS OF THE ENGLISH COULRTS BUT WITH THAT DECISION AS THE LAW OF VIRGINIA THE COURT HELD THAT WHEN THE SOUITHERN RAIL WAY COMPANY HAD MADE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR THE PUBLIC CONVENIENCE BY A PROPER CONTRACT PROVIDING FOR A SUFFICIENT NIUMBER OF WVAGONS TO INSURE PROMPT DELIVERY OF BAGGAGE FOR THE TRAVELLING PUBLIC NOT ONLY INSIDE OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE BUT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ADJACENT THERETO AND GAVE REASONABLE NOTICE TO OTHER SOLICITORS FOR BAGGAGE IT COULD THEN AND ONLY THEN LAWFULLY AND LEGALLY EXCLUDE BAGGAGE SOLICITORS OTHER THAN THOSE SELECTED BY IT FROM ITS STATION PROPERTY BUT THAT PENDING THIS ARRANGEMENT IT COULD LAY DOWN ALL PROPER AND REASONABLE RULES FOR THEIR CONDUCT WHILE ON ITS PROPERTY AND MIGHT INCLUDE IN THOSE RULES A REASONABLE LITNE WITHINI WHICH THE SOLICITORS MUST CONFINE THEMSELVES THE COURT FURTHER HELD THAT SAID RAILWAY COMPANY HAD NOT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME UPON THE FACTS PRESENTED MIADE SUCH ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR THE PUBLIC CON VENIENCE AND DISMISSED THE WARRANT AGAINST SHEPHERD AT THE COST OF THE SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY WHICH HAD BEEN MARKED AS PROSECUTOR AND INSTRUCTED THE POLICEMAN NOT TO FURTHER INTERFERE WITH NEGRO BAGAGE MEN UNTIL FURTHER AND ADE QUATE ARRANGEMENTS FOR PUBLIC CONVENIENCE WERE MADE BY THE RAILWAY COMPANY

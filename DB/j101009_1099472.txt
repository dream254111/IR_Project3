death the whole world mourns If a Vir ginia court were called upon to construe this will there would be muclh room for the argument that instead of Mrs McKinleys taking a life estate as tlle testator clearly intended she takes a feesimple charged only with the annuity to the testators mother and to the exclusion of the remaindermen The Virginia courts lhave pushed to the utmost limit what is known in this State as the doc trine of May v Joynes  20 Gratt 692that is that a limitation for life and  what remains  over in fee to another carries a feesimple to the the first takerwhether the estate be real or personal See Farish v lVayrnan 91 Va 430 21 S E 810 1 Va Law Reg 214 and note by Judge Burks collecting the Virginia authorities See also a striking illuistration of the extremity to which the doctrine has been carried in Robertson v Hffardy Va  23 S E 766 In most of the States the courts are more liberal in upholding the intention of the testator and limiting the estate in such case to a life estate in the first taker unless it distinctly appear that such was not the intention of the testator See Giles v Little 104 U S 291 Rubey v Barnett 12 Mo 3 49 Am Dec 112 and note 115119 Compare

WILLIAM MCKINLEY A DISTINGUISHED INDIAN JUDGEThe July number of the Bombay Inidia Law Reporter contains a sketch of the life of the late Mr Justice Rauiade a native East Indian and at his deatlh a member of the Hihll Cotirt of India It says of him that the tributes paid to his memory by the government the puiblic and the press AngloIndian and native fully testify that India lhas lost the greatest man of the present generation A portrait of the deceased jurist accompanies the sketch and represents him as clad in his official robes with white turban and sashes The following extract gives an idea of some of the curious questions arising under Hindu jurisprudence No more important function falls to the lot of an Indian juldge than that of ascertaining and applying the personal law of the various communities which inhabit this country The whole system of modern HinDdu law is thus a super structure raised on old fouindations to which everv judge who has sat on the High Court bench has contributed his mite Mr Justice Ranades contribution to this branch of lndian judiciary law has been both solid in quality and large in quani tity His greatforte was his intimate knowledge of life in the moffussil A judge who administers Hindu law has not merely to consider whether a particular rule can be deduced from old texts and commentaries but also to satisfy himself that it has been accepted as law by the current usage of the people And who could speak with higher authority on this usage than Mr Justice Ranade Thus on the question of adoption by a widow who had not removed her hair or the adop tion by her of her brothers son or of a son older than herself or the right to recognition as regenerate classes of castes that claimed to be so his opinion of what daily practice had made current was almost conclusive One rarely sees a handsorner tribute to a dead judge than the following Measured by almost any standard Mr Ranade was a great man Even a strauger meeting him for the first time could not fail to recoguize that he was in every way far removed from ordinary mortals Though hiis stature the massive ness of his head the resoluteness of his face and the determination of his carriage were a little awe inspiring yet his noble heart was all simplicity itself He him self once said in a speech No man can be called great who has not to the last hour of his life fulfilled the responsibility which greatness implies and it is in his own life that we see a vivid picture of this Such a towering character so glorious a career deserves to be studied for it will always remind the future gen erations that The height bv great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight But they while their companionis slept Were toilinig upwards in the night And tllough death has laid its icy hands on him he has secured his niche in the temple of fame and has built himself a livelong monument442 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct DOUBLE ASSESSMENTS UPON SHAREHOLDERS OF NATIONAL BANKSLoss OF FUNDS BY RECEIVERAn interesting decision in banking law was recently ren dered by District Court Judge Newman in an action before the Circuit Court for the Northern District of Georgia Lease v Barschall 106 Fed Rep 762 It was there held that 1 Under the National Banking Act Rev St sec 5151 requiring that the shlareholders of every national banik shall be held individually responsible equally and ratably and not one for another for all debts of the bank to the extent of the amount of their stock at the par value thereof in addition to the amount in vested in such stock a stockholder cannot be requiired to make good the failure of another stockholder to pay his assessment and where an assessment has been made it must be considered for the purpose of making a second assessment as if the entire assessment had been paid 2 Where stockholders of a national bank have paid an assessment to a re ceiver of the bank the receiver becomes the trustee of the creditors and any loss he may sustain by investments in endeavoring to save the debts of the bank can not be charged to the shareholders and made the subject of an additional assess ment William Lease receiver of the Chattahoochee National Bank sought to recover from Barschall and others stockholders a second assessment of thirtynine per cent  there having been a former assessment of sixtyone per cent Some 14 80217 of the amount sought to be collected was to make good the failure of stockholders to pay the amount of the former assessment The exact language of the National Banking Act Rev St sec 5151 is as follows The shareholders of every national banking association shall be held individ ually responsible equallv and ratably and not one for ainother for all contracts debts and engagements of such association to the extent of the amount of their stock therein at the par value thereof in addition to the amount invested in such shares No shareholder it will seem can be required to make good the failure of another shareholder to pay the amount of his assessment and where an assess ment of 61000 is made it must be considered for the purpose of making another assessment as if the entire 61000 had been paid In United States v KInox 102 U S 422 26 L Ed 216 in the opinion by MIr Justice Swayne the Supreme Court states the rule in reference to the assessment of stockholders as follows In the process to be pursued to fix the amount of the separate liability of each of the shareholders it is necessary to ascertain 1 the whole anount of the par value of all the stock held by all the shareholders 2 the amount of the deficit to be paid after exhausting all the assets of the bank 3 then to apply the rule that each shareholder shall contribute suclh sum as will bear the same proportion to the whole amount of the deficit as his stock bears to the whole amount of the capital stock of the bank at its par value There is a limitation of this liability It cannot in tlle aggregate exceed the entire amount of the par value of all the stock1901 MISCELLANY 443 As to the rights of stockholders in case an attempt is made to assess them in violation of this rule this is stated Although assessments made by the controller under the circumstances of the first assessment in this case and all other assessments successive or otherwise not exceeding the par value of all the stock of the bank are conclusive upon the stockholders yet if he were to attempt to enforce one made clearly and palpably contrary to the views we have expressed it cannot be doubted that a court of equity if its aid were invoked would promptly restrain him by injunction It appears further that the receiver lost a large amount in endeavoring to save debts of the bank by investing in various propertiesa brewery a coal mine and an orange groveand that it is attempted to make this good also by this additional assessment against the stockholders It is clear that after money has been paid by the stockholders into the hands of the receiver of a national bank the receiver becomes the trustee of the creditors and any loss he may sustain however honest his endeavor to benefit the creditors of the bank cannot be charged to the shareholders and made the subject of additional assessment In Scott v Armstrong 146 U S 499 13 Sup Ct 148 36 L Ed 1059 it is said that the receiver of a national bank takes the assets in trust for the creditors Lease v Barsechall 106 Fed Rep 762The American Lawyer EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES BY CARRIERSIn view of the widespread interest in the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals of this State in N  W 1 Co v Old Dominion Baggage Co 6 Va Law Reg 693 permitting railroad com panies under certain conditions to give exclusive privileges to baggagemen at stations we print below the reports of two cases in which effort was made by the excluded baggagemen to bring themselves within the exception suggested by the Court of Appeals namely that such exclusive privilege must give way when it interferes with public convenience The first case reported below was disposed of in the Mayors Court of Lynch burgthe opinion which we print beinig delivered by Mayor Smith The second case reported was decided by Judge George W Morris of the Cor poration court of Charlottesville No written opinion was delivered but our report of the case fully discloses the grounds upon wlhich the decision was rested WVingo v N1o6foik  Vestern Railroad CompanyOpinion by Mayor G W Smith This is a warrant sworn out by R E Wingo against the Norfolk aind Western Railway Company charging it with violating section 3 of an Act regulating com mon carriers approved March 3 1892 by giving an undue preference to the Lynch burg Transfer Company by leasing it the exclusive right to solicit baggage at the Uniotn Station in the city of Lynchburg the property of the Norfolk  Western Railway Company The statute in question has been construed by the Court of Appeals in the recent case of the Norfolk  Western Railway Company v The Old Dominion Baggage Company decided on the 17th of March 1901 6 Va Law Reg 693 the object of which suit was to restrain the Norfolk  Western Railway Company from giving the Lynchburg Transfer Company the exclusive right to enter its station property and solicit baggage on the ground that it was an undue preference within the meaning of the above statute and was therefore condemned by it The de444 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct cision of the Court of Appeals was in favor of the railway company the court holding that the Act was intended to prevent a substantial injury or inconvenience to the public that the mere fact that one baggage company was allowed to solicit baggage on the companys property while the privilege was denied to another did not in itself constitute a violation of the Act but that it must appear on the com plaint of those who use the railway that the action of the railway company in granting this exclusive privilege was so unreasonable as to result in a substantial inconvenience to the public in which event the contract would be set aside In deciding the case before me therefore it is necessary to determine whether the exclusive right given to the Lychburg Transfer Company to solicit baggage on the companys property works a substantial inconvenience to the public It is not charged in the complaint nor is it contended that any person or firm has been prevented in any way from delivering or receiving baggage at the station for the traveling public The sole ground of complaint is that the Norfolk  Western Railway Companv has given the Lynchburg Transfer Company the ex clusive right to come on its property and solicit baggage The question is whether or not the railway company by giving this exclusive privilege has violated the statute in question It appeared in the evidence that the contract with the Transfer Company was made on the 15th of March 1901 and is to continue for one year that the Trans fer Company is given the exclusive right to enter the station property of the Nor folk  Western Railway Company for the purpose of soliciting baggage from incoming passengers that it is also required to mleet all trains and deliver baggage at any point in the city or to call at any point in the city and receive baggage and deliver it to any train at a charge not to exceed twentyfive cents for trunks and ten cents for valises and in adldition it is required to meet all trains with an ade quate number of hacks and carry passengers to any point in the city or to call with a hack at any point in the city and carry a passenger to any train at a price not to exceed twentyfive cents for each passenger the baggage company further agreed to pav the Norfolk  Western Railway Company a money consideration in return for this exclusive privilege of soliciting baggage on its property It further ap peared in evidence that Mr Wingo is conducting a transfer business under the style of the Hill City Transfer Company in competition with the Lynchburg Transfer Company and that he is compelled to solicit baggage at the head of the steps leading dp from the depot and that his rates for hauling baggage do not ex ceed fifteen cents It was contended that the fact that he could not come upon the companys property and solicit baggage worked a substantial public inconveni ence in that it compelled a passenger if he wished to avail himself of the fifteen cent rate to go up the flight of steps at the station to employ Mr Wingo or his agents Conceding for the sake of the argument that Mr Wingo is entitled to make this complaint it does not seem to me that in the light of the decision of the Court of Appeals the contract complained of can be said to work a asubstantial inconveniience to the puiblic If a passenger wishes to save ten cents in the haul ing of his baggage he can do so by going to the lhead of t he steps which is near by and in plain view of the station Mr Wingo and every other member of the public has access to the station property for the delivery of or the removal of bag gage or for any other purpose except the soliciting of baggage from incoming trains If passengers do not object to paying twentyfive cents for the delivery of1901 MISCELLANY 445 their baggage there are agents immediately at hand ready to receive it and if they prefer to employ Mr Wingo or anybody else at a lower rate than twentyfive cents they can do so by going to the head of the steps in question for that purpose My feelings and judgment are against any contract or combination which con stitutes a monopoly but I do not think in view of the decision of the Court of Appeals I would be justified in holding the contract in this case void It may be some inconvenience in individual cases to go to the head of the steps at the sta tion to employ Mr Wingo but this can hardly be said to constitute a substantial inconvenience to the public which is necessary to the granting of the relief asked for If however it should be made to appear at any future time that this con tract in the manner in which it was carried out was so unreasonable as to result in substantial inconvenience to the public I would not hesitate to condemn it Counsel for Mr Wingo relied with great earnestness on the brief of the attor neys for the Old Dominion Transfer Company in the Court of Appeals but as the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals was against the views expressed in that brief it cannot be received as authority in this couirt The warrant must be dismissed City of Charlottesville v William ShepherdReport of decision by Judge George W Morris This case came up in the Corporation court of the city of Charlottesville upon an appeal from the judgment of the police justice imposing a fine for trespass upon the railroad property of the Southern Railway Company under an ordinance of the city of Charlottesville The facts developed in the trial of the case were as follows For years past the baggage delivery and transfer business in and adjacent to the city of Charlottesville had been in the hands of eight or ten colored men with wagons licensed by the city In Septemnber 1900 the Southern Railway Company entered into a contract with Eldridge Turner and W T Cloud calling themselves The Charlottesville and University Transfer Company whereby they were given certain rights of soliciting on trains and in order to do so of riding between stations but giving them no exclusive privilege of entrance to and soliciting at stations Early in September 1901 it was alleged this contract was transferred to one A C Mitchell though no written evidence of such transfer or of any obli gation assumed by Mitchell was prodiuced at the trial A day or two prior to September 13 1901 Z L Dameron a policeman of the city of Charlottesville employed at the Southern Railway depot and in part paid by the Southern Railway Company acting under written instructions from the Southern Railway Company which were in evidence at the trial warned all of the negro baggage men that they would no longer be permitted to come upon the property of the railway company except when in the actual possession of a clheck for baggage and that then they must go directly to the baggageroom and get the baggage anid go away and that in soliciting trade they must come no nearer than the public street which as appeared in evidence was fully fifty feet from the station and not in the pathway of passengers who departed by vehicle That on and after that date only the Charlottesville and University Transfer Companys agents would be given access to the station property to solicit business The bag gage men disobeyed this warning and five of them were arrested under wrrrants446 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct issued by the police justice for trespassing upon the  railroad property of the Southern Railway Company The warrants were issued under a city ordinance Four cases were dismissed by the justice and in the fifth that of Shepherd a fine was imposed This case was then appealed In addition to the facts stated above it appeared at the trial that the Charlottes ville and University Transfer Company had and paid license on only one wagon That just at this season of the year University students and schoolboys and school girls were coming in to Charlottesville bv the hundred and that all of the wagons of all of the baggage men were in use until late at night in delivering bag gage That the contract of the Charlottesville and University Transfer Companiy obligated them to deliver baggage witlhin but niot outside of city limits though as a matter of fact they did deliver outside and that a very large part of the baggage arriving was for delivery outside of the city There was no evidence that the baggage business had not been conducted theretofore by the negro baggage men in an orderly and satisfactory manner The court in rendering its decision stated that it felt constrained of course to follow the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Norfolk  Western Railway Company v Old Dominion Baggage Company in construinig the Act of 18912 providing against  any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage etc being given by a common carrier though but for that case it would have construed that statute differently and for the reason that its intent seems plain in its language without reading into it the decisions of the English coulrts But with that decision as the law of Virginia the court held that when the Souithern Rail way Company had made adequate provision for the public convenience by a proper contract providing for a sufficient niumber of wvagons to insure prompt delivery of baggage for the travelling public not only inside of the city of Charlottesville but in the neighborhood adjacent thereto and gave reasonable notice to other solicitors for baggage it could then and only then lawfully and legally exclude baggage solicitors other than those selected by it from its station property but that pending this arrangement it could lay down all proper and reasonable rules for their conduct while on its property and might include in those rules a reasonable litne withini which the solicitors must confine themselves The court further held that said railway company had not up to the present time upon the facts presented miade such adequate provision for the public con venience and dismissed the warrant against Shepherd at the cost of the Southern Railway Company which had been marked as prosecutor and instructed the policeman not to further interfere with negro bagage men until further and ade quate arrangements for public convenience were made by the railway company

EMINENT MATHEMATICIAN DIVIDETH THIS TREATISE INTO FIVE PARTS OF WHICH THE FIRST CONTAINETH HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PENDULUM WATCH THE6069 THE SECOND TREATS OF THE DESCENT OF HEAVY BODIESAND THEIR MOTION IN A CYCLOID THAT IS IN A LINE WHICH A NAIL FASTND IN THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF A RUNNING WHEEL BY ITS CONTINUED CIR CUMROTATION DESIGNETH IN THE AIR THE THIRD OF THE EVOLATION AND DIMENSION OF CURVE LINES THE FOURTH OF THE CENTER OF VIBRATION THE FIFTHOF THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN OTHER WATCH WHERE IN THE PENDULUM MOVETH CIRCULARLY TOGETHER WITH SOME THE OREMS DE VI CENTRIFUGA WHY THE AUTHOR HATH JOYNED ALL THESE MATTERS TOGETHER IN THIS BOOKWILL APPEAR FROM HIS OWN DISCOURSE PREMISED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SAME IT SEEMS THEN THAT HAVING SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF HIS FIRST TRACT CONCERNING THE WATCHES BY HIM INVENTED FOUND MANY THINGS RELATING TO THE PERFECTION OF THAT WORK HE THOUGHT GOOD TO GRATIFY THE PUBLICK WITH THEM ESPECIALLY SEEING THAT THESE PARTICULARS ARE BY HIM LOOKT UPON AS THE MAINAND AS TWERE THE GROUND OF THIS WHOLE MECHA NISM WHICH BEFORE IT WAS DESTITURE OF FOR A SIMPLE PEN DULUM BEING NO CERTAIN AND EQUAL MEASURE OF TIME IN REGARD THAT LARGER EXCURSIONS ARE OBSERVD TO BE SLOWER THAN THE NAR ROWERHE HATH BY THE AID OF GEOMETRY LIGHTED UPON A WAY OF SUSPENDING THE PENDULUM BY FINDING OUT A CERTAIN CURVE LINE THAT IS APPROPRIATE TO GIVE IT THAT DESIRED EQUALITY WHICH HA VING APPLIED TO WATCHES THEIR MOTION HATH BY THIS MEANS BEEN RENDRED SO CONSTANT AND CERTAIN THAT BY FREQUENT EXPE RIMENTS THEY ARE NOW KNOWN TO BE EXCEEDINGLY USEFUL BOTH IN ASTRONOMY AND NAVIGATION THIS BEING THE CYCLOID ABOVE MENTIONEDOUR AUTHOR MAKETH IT HIS CHIEF BUSINESS IN THIS TREA TISE TO GIVE A VERY ACCURATE DEMONSTRATION THEREOF TO WHICH HE THOUGHT IT REQUISITE TO PREMISE SOME NEW DEMONSTRATIONS TO ESTABLISH AND ADVANCE THE DOCTRINE OF GALILAEI TOUCHING THE DESCENT OF HEAVY BODIES THE TOPFRUIT OF WHICH HE COUNTS TO BE THIS VERY PROPRIETY OF THE CYCLOID BUT THEN THAT THIS CYCLOID MIGHT BE ADAPTED TO THE USE OF PENDULUMS HE THOUGHT HIMSELF OBLIGED TO ENTER UPON A NEW CONSIDERATION OF CURVE LINES VIZ OF THOSE WHICH BY THEIR EVOLUTION GENERATE OTHER CURVES WHENCE RESULTED THE COM L L L L L L 2 PARISON6070 PARISON OF THE LENGTH OF CURVE LINES WITH STREIGHT ONES WHICH ARGUMENT BY REASON OF ITS EXCELLENCY AND NOVELTY HE ACKNOWLEDGES TO HAVE PROSECUTED FURTHER THAN HIS PRESENT DESIGNX REQUIRED WHERE OCCURS THE WAY OF FINDING A STREIGHT LINE EQUAL TO A PARABOLOIDINVENTED BY THAT INTELLIGENT ENGLISH GENTLEMAN WILLIAM NEILE SINCE SNATCHT FROM US BY AN UNTIME LY DEATH TO THE EXCEEDING GREAT REGRETT OF THOSE THAT KNEW HIS WORTH BESIDES FOR THE CLEARER EXPLICATION OF THE NATURE OF THE COMPOUNDED PENDULUM THE USEFULNESS WHEREOF HE SHEWS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE AUTOMATA HE THOUGHT FIT TO SUBJOYN THEREUNTO THE SPECULATION OF THE CENTERS OF AGITATION IN WHICH OCCURR MANY CONSIDERABLE THEOREMS APPERTAINING TO LINEAR PLAIN AND SOLID FIGURES TO ALL WHICH HE PROMISES THE MECHANICAL STRUCTURE OF THE WATCHAND THE APPLICATION OF THE PENDULUM THERETO ENRICH ING THAT PART WITH HIS TABLE OF THE AEQUATION OF DAYES AS AL SO WITH A RELATION OF THE SEVERAL SUCCESSES OF SUCH WATCHES EMPLOYED IN CONSIDERABLE SEAVOYAGES OF WHICH HE SAITH THE BEST OF ALL HATH BEEN WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE EXPEDITION OF THE LATE DUKE OF BEAUFORT INTO CANDIA WHO HAVING TAKEN WITH HIM IN HIS OWN SHIP TWO OF THOSE WATCHES AND APPOINTED A GOOD ASTRONOMER TO TAKE CARE OF THEM THE LONGITUDES OF THE PLACES WHICH THEY EITHER TOUCHED AT IN THAT VOYAGE OR WHICH IN PASSING BY THEY COULD SEEWERE BY MEANS OF THE SAID WATCHES EXACTLY MEASURED SO AS THAT THE VERY SAME DIFFERENCES OF LONGITUDES WERE FOUND BY THE ACCURATEST MAPS ASSIGNED TO THOSE PLACES BUT SINCE THOSE TRYALS OUR AUTHOR AFFIRMS TO HAVE IMPRO VED HIS WATCHES BY USING A PENDULUM OF A TRIANGULAR FIGURE AND BY AN OTHER WAY OF SUSPENDING THEM OF WHICH HE GIVES AN AMPLE DESCRIPTION TO WHICH WE REFER THE READER CON CLUDING THIS ACCOUNT WITH TAKING NOTICE OF HIS UNIVERSAL AND PERPETUAL MEASURE WHICH HE ESTABLLISHETH BY EXACTLY TAKING THE MEASURE OF THE DISTANCE FROM THE POINT OF SUSPENSION TO THE CENTER OF AGITATION OF A SIMPLE PENDULUM VIBRATING A SECOND OF TIME WHICH BEING FOUND TO BE SUCH A LENGTH AS BEING DIVIDED INTO THREE EQUAL PARTS WILL MAKE SUCH A MEASURE AS HE CALLS AN HORARY6071 HORARY FOOT WHIEH HAVING SUCH OR SUCH A PROPORTION TO ALL O THER FEET MAY BE USED TO SETTLE A CONSTANT AND CERTAIN MEASURE EVERY WHERE AND TO RECOVER IT IN ALL AGES FORASMUCH AS TIME WILL BE ALWAYS AND IN ALL PLACES THE SAME AND CONSEQUENTLY SUCH A LENGTH BEING TAKEN AS EXACTLY EQUALS A SECONDOF TIME A JUST UNIVERSAL MEASURE IS OBTAINED II MODERN FORTIFICATION C BY SIR JONAS MOOR MASTER SURVEYER OF HIS MAJESTIES ORDNANCE LONDON 1673 IN 8O THE WORTHY AND INTELLIGENT AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK COM PREHENDS IN A SMALL VOLUME WHATEVER HATH BEEN DESIG NED AND PRACTISED BY THE LATEST AND MOST EXPERIENCED INGI NEERS OF THIS AGE ITALIAN FRENCH DUTCH AND ENGLISH AND THE MANNER OF DEFENDING AND BEFIEGING FORTS AND OTHER PLA CES TOGETHER WITH THE USE OF A JOYNTRULER OR SECTOR FOR THE SPEEDY DESCRIPTION OF ANY FORTIFICATION ALL WHICH HE DOTH BY SUCH EASY RULESAS IF HE HAD CALCULATED THIS HIS TREATISE FOR THE MEANEST CAPACITIES HE DIVIDES THE BOOK INTO 8 CHAPTERS THE FIRST CONTAINS CERTAIN PROPOSITIONS NECESSARY TO BE KNOWN BEFOREHAND BORROWD FROM GEOMETRY AS ALSO HIS WAY OF TAKING THE PLAT OF ANY TOWN OR PLACE TOGETHER WITH HIS GREAT CARE IN RECONCILING THE DIFFERENCES OF MEASURES OF SE VERAL COUNTRIESFOUND IN THE TABLES OF SNELLIUSDOGENGREAVES NICCIOLUSC AND PARTICULARLY IN COMPARING THE ENGLISH FOOT WITH THE FAMOUS MEASURES OF OTHER PLACES MENTIONING WITH AL MOUTONS UNIVERSAL FOOTOR A PENDULUM THAT WILL VIBRATE 132 TIMES IN A MINUTE OF TIME THE SECOND TREATS OF THE MOST MODERN FORTIFICATIONS OF RE GULAR FIGURESWHERE THE AUTHOR DISCOURSING OF COUNT PAGANS WAYWHEREIN THE FLANK STANDS AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH THE LINE OF DEFENCE TAKES NOTICETHAT THIS WAY HATH BEEN NOT ONLY AP PROVED BUT MUCH FACILITATED BY HIS MAJESTY OF GREAT BRITAIN CHARLES II THE THIRD TEACHES THE USES OF THE JOYNTRULERAMONG WHICH THOSE ARE VERY CONSIDERABLE ONES THAT IT CONTAINS NOT ONLY A TABLE SHEWING WHAT WEIGHT OF POWDER IS ALLOWED FOR PROOF OF6072 OF ALL GUNS CAST IN ENGLAND BUT ALSO THE WEIGHTS OF THE SHOT IN IRON FOR THE SEVERAL SIZES OF GUNS TOGETHER WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE POWDER ALLOWD TO EACH SEAGUNNER FOR SERVICE WHERE THE AUTHOR INSERTS A VERY NECESSARY AND USEFUL ADVICE TO THIS PURPOSEVIZ THAT IF THE SEACAPTAINS WOULD SERIOUSLY CONCERN THEMSELVES IN EMPLOYING TRUSTY PERSONS TO SEE THE CARTRIDGES JUSTLY FILLED WITH THE APPOINTED ALLOWANCEAND AT THEIR LEASURE TO TURN THE POWDER OUT OF SOME CARTRIDGES ALREADY FITTEDAND WEIGH ITTO SEE THAT THE GUNNER WRONG NOT THEIR GUNS THEY WOULD FIND THEIR BULLETS FLY FURTHER AND DO MORE EXECUTION ADDING THIS REMARKABLE NOTE THAT THE OFFICERS OF THE ORD NANCE KNOW THAT POWDER PROVED TOWERPROOF IS A FIFTH PART STRONGER THAN ANY DUTCH POWDER THAT HATH BEEN BROUGHT THI THER THE FOURTH TREATS OF RAMPIRES PARAPETS TONAILUS MOTES

HE IS NOW PREPARINGOF ALL THE FORMS OF FORTIFICATIONS AND MODLES OF ALL SORTS OF ENGINS OF WAROF WHAT NATURE SOEVERIN FAIRPRINTSTHAT HAVE BEEN MADE ORINVENTED TO THIS DAY A VERY DESIRABLE WORK THE HASTENING OF WHICH IS VERY MUCH WISHT BY THE CURIOUS III THE ELEMENTS OF THAT MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE CALLD ALGEBRA BY JOHN KERSEY LONDON 1673 AN IN FOL IN N 90 OF THESE TRACTSAN ADVERTISEMENT WAS GIVEN OF A BODY OF ALGEBRA PREPARED FOR THE PRESS BY THAT EMINENT ALGEBRAIST MR JOHN KERSEYCONSISTING OF FOUR BOOKS WE NOW GIVE NOTICE TO THE READER THAT THE TWO FIRST OF THEM ARE SINCE ACTUALLY PRINTED AND NOW EXPOSED TO SALE AS FOR THE ARGU MENT OF THEM SINCE A PRETTY LARGE ACCOUNT WAS THEN RENDRED CONCERNING THEM IN THE SAID TRACT WE SHALL NOW ONLY ACQUAINT THE READER FIRST THAT THE AUTHOR WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE SO FULLY AND PLAINLY HANDLED THE MATTERTHAT AN ORDINARY CAPACITY WITHOUT ANY OTHER TEACHER MAY ATTAIN THIS EXCELLENT KNOWLEDG WHICH EXTENDS ITSELF THROUGH ALL THE PARTS OF THE MATHEMATICKSBEING THE VERY ART OF INVENTION OFINNUMERABLE THEOREMS AND THEIR DEMONSTRATIONS BOTH IN ARITHMETICK AND ALL PARTS OF GEOME TRYWHETHER PLAIN CURVILINEARSOLID OR LOCAL SECONDLY THAT WHEREAS MANY DO WONDERWHY SOME FORRAIGN NATIONS ARE SO FERTILE AND THE ENGLISH SO BARREN OF GOOD MA THEMATICAL BOOKS IN THEIR MOTHER TONGUE THE REASON THEREOF AND OF THE LOSS OF MANY MENS LABORIOUS AND EXCELLENT WRITINGS AND INVENTIONSIS THAT THEBOOKSELLERS BEING DISCOURAGED BY THE SLOW6074 SLOWNESS OF SALE ARE NOT WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE PRINTING OF THEM NOW THAT ALGEBRA MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME FARE WE HAVE THIS TO SAY FROM THE JUDGEMENT OF SOBER AND KNOWING MATHE MATICIANSTHAT THERE IS NOT THE LIKECOLLECTION OF ALGEBRA EXTANT IN LATIN OR ANY OTHER LANGUAGETHAT WE KNOW OF WHENCE THIS BOOK HATH MET WITH THE APPROBATION AND APPLAUSE OF THE MOST LEARND IN THAT SCIENCE AND IF IT FIND A SUTABLE ACCEPTATIONSA TISFACTORY TO OUR STATIONERSIT WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO HAFTEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH PARTOF

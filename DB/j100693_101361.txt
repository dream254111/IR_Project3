eminent Mathematician divideth this Treatise into Five parts of which The First containeth his description of the Pendulum Watch The6069 The Second treats of the descent of Heavy bodiesand their Motion in a Cycloid that is in a Line which a Nail fastnd in the circumference of a running wheel by its continued cir cumrotation designeth in the Air The Third of the Evolation and Dimension of Curve Lines The Fourth of the Center of Vibration The Fifthof the construction of an other Watch where in the Pendulum moveth Circularly together with some The orems de Vi Centrifuga Why the Author hath joyned all these matters together in this Bookwill appear from his own discourse premised in the beginning of the same It seems then that having since the publication of his first Tract concerning the Watches by him invented found many things relating to the perfection of that work he thought good to gratify the publick with them especially seeing that these Particulars are by him lookt upon as the mainand as twere the ground of this whole Mecha nism which before it was destiture of For a simple Pen dulum being no Certain and Equal Measure of time in regard that larger excursions are observd to be slower than the nar rowerhe hath by the aid of Geometry lighted upon a way of suspending the Pendulum by finding out a certain Curve Line that is appropriate to give it that desired Equality which ha ving applied to Watches their Motion hath by this means been rendred so constant and certain that by frequent Expe riments they are now known to be exceedingly useful both in Astronomy and Navigation This being the Cycloid above mentionedour Author maketh it his chief business in this Trea tise to give a very accurate demonstration thereof To which he thought it requisite to premise some new Demonstrations to establish and advance the Doctrine of Galilaei touching the Descent of Heavy bodies the topfruit of which he counts to be this very propriety of the Cycloid But then that this Cycloid might be adapted to the Use of Pendulums he thought himself obliged to enter upon a new consideration of Curve Lines viz of those which by their Evolution generate other Curves Whence resulted the com L l l l l l 2 parison6070 parison of the length of Curve lines with Streight ones which argument by reason of its excellency and novelty he acknowledges to have prosecuted further than his present designx required Where occurs the way of finding a streight line equal to a Paraboloidinvented by that intelligent English Gentleman William Neile since snatcht from us by an untime ly death to the exceeding great regrett of those that knew his worth Besides for the clearer explication of the nature of the Compounded Pendulum the usefulness whereof he shews in the construction of these Automata he thought fit to subjoyn thereunto the speculation of the Centers of Agitation in which occurr many considerable Theorems appertaining to linear plain and solid figures To all which he promises the Mechanical Structure of the Watchand the Application of the Pendulum thereto enrich ing that part with his Table of the AEquation of Dayes as al so with a Relation of the several successes of such Watches employed in considerable seavoyages of which he saith the best of all hath been which was found in the Expedition of the late Duke of Beaufort into Candia who having taken with him in his own ship two of those Watches and appointed a good Astronomer to take care of them The longitudes of the places which they either touched at in that voyage or which in passing by they could seewere by means of the said watches exactly measured so as that the very same differences of longitudes were found by the accuratest Maps assigned to those places But since those Tryals our Author affirms to have impro ved his watches by using a Pendulum of a Triangular figure and by an other way of suspending them of which he gives an ample description to which we refer the Reader con cluding this account with taking notice of his Universal and Perpetual Measure which he establlisheth by exactly taking the measure of the distance from the point of suspension to the center of agitation of a simple Pendulum vibrating a second of Time which being found to be such a length as being divided into three equal parts will make such a measure as he calls an Horary6071 Horary foot whieh having such or such a proportion to all o ther Feet may be used to settle a constant and certain measure every where and to recover it in all ages Forasmuch as Time will be always and in all places the same and consequently such a length being taken as exactly equals a secondof Time a just Universal Measure is obtained II MODERN FORTIFICATION c By Sir Jonas Moor Master surveyer of his Majesties Ordnance London 1673 in 8o THE Worthy and Intelligent Author of this Book com prehends in a small volume whatever hath been desig ned and practised by the Latest and most Experienced Ingi neers of this Age Italian French Dutch and English and the manner of Defending and Befieging FORTS and other PLA CES together with the Use of a JoyntRuler or sector for the speedy description of any Fortification All which he doth by such easy Rulesas if he had calculated this his Treatise for the meanest Capacities He divides the Book into 8 Chapters The first contains certain Propositions necessary to be known beforehand borrowd from Geometry as also his way of taking the Plat of any Town or Place together with his great care in reconciling the differences of Measures of se veral Countriesfound in the Tables of SnelliusDogenGreaves Nicciolusc and particularly in comparing the English Foot with the famous Measures of other Places mentioning with al Moutons Universal Footor a Pendulum that will vibrate 132 times in a minute of Time The Second treats of the most Modern Fortifications of re gular Figureswhere the Author discoursing of Count Pagans waywherein the Flank stands at right Angles with the Line of defence takes noticethat this way hath been not only ap proved but much facilitated by his Majesty of Great Britain CHARLES II The third teaches the Uses of the Joyntruleramong which those are very considerable ones that it contains not only a Table shewing what weight of Powder is allowed for Proof of6072 of all Guns cast in England but also the weights of the Shot in Iron for the several sizes of Guns together with the weight of the Powder allowd to each Seagunner for service Where the Author inserts a very necessary and useful Advice to this purposeviz That if the SeaCaptains would seriously concern themselves in employing trusty persons to see the Cartridges justly filled with the appointed Allowanceand at their leasure to turn the Powder out of some Cartridges already fittedand weigh itto see that the Gunner wrong not their Guns they would find their Bullets fly further and do more execution Adding this remarkable note that the Officers of the Ord nance know that Powder proved Towerproof is a fifth part stronger than any Dutch powder that hath been brought thi ther The fourth treats of Rampires Parapets Tonailus Motes Covertwayes and their several Dimensions and Measures to gether with the whole way of laying down the Prosile as also the Rules how to cast up the Solidity of a Rampire and its Parapet together with the Parapet of the Covert way beyond the Counter scarp and thereby to proportion the Wideness and Depth of the Mote that sufficient Earth may be gotten out of the same Where is annexed the way of building up a Fort and also the Estimate to be made of the Charges that will be required to do the same To which is added a de scription of the works usually made both within and without Forts as also the manner of describing upon Paper by way of Perspective the aforesaid Works The Fifth contains the doctrine of Irregular Fortifications by which it appearsthat tis requisitan Ingineer should make first a Plot of the whole Ground to be fortified with all the wayspassagesold walls if there be any RiversPoolsEnclo sures and all other matter fit to be known in the draught which donehe may then design what works he shall think most agreeing to the place The Sixth teaches the way how to defend a Fort and in order to ithow a Governor ought to be qualified and what strength and number of Men Victuals Ammunition and In struments of war are necessary for its defence The6073 The Seventh treats of the way of Besieging places by bloc king up breaking of Groundopening of trenchesbuilding of Batteries brining on Galleriesand Mining The eighth delivers in English a short Discourse written in French by Monsieur de la Mont of Fortification offensive and defensive printed at Paris 1671 To which is annexed the Ta ble of Angles taken out of Count Pagan So much of this Tract whichwe hopewill in due time be followd by that large and costly piece the Author saith in the Epistle Dedicatory he is now preparingof all the Forms of Fortifications and Modles of all sorts of Engins of warof what nature soeverin fairPrintsthat have been made orinvented to this day A very desirable work the hastening of which is very much wisht by the Curious III The Elements of that Mathematical Science calld Algebra by John Kersey London 1673 an in fol IN N 90 of these Tractsan Advertisement was given of a Body of Algebra prepared for the Press by that eminent Algebraist Mr John Kerseyconsisting of four Books We now give notice to the Reader that the Two first of them are since actually printed and now exposed to sale As for the Argu ment of them since a pretty large account was then rendred concerning them in the said Tract we shall now only acquaint the Reader First that the Author will be found to have so fully and plainly handled the matterthat an ordinary capacity without any other Teacher may attain this excellent knowledg which extends itself through all the parts of the Mathematicksbeing the very Art of Invention ofinnumerable Theorems and their Demonstrations both in Arithmetick and all parts of Geome trywhether Plain Curvilinearsolid or local Secondly that whereas many do wonderwhy some forraign Nations are so fertile and the English so barren of good Ma thematical Books in their Mother tongue the reason thereof and of the loss of many mens laborious and excellent writings and inventionsis that theBooksellers being discouraged by the slow6074 slowness of sale are not willing to undertake the printing of them Now that Algebra may not have the same fare we have this to say from the Judgement of sober and knowing Mathe maticiansthat there is not the likeCollection of Algebra extant in Latin or any other Languagethat we know of whence this Book hath met with the approbation and applause of the most Learnd in that Science And if it find a sutable acceptationsa tisfactory to our stationersit will encourage them to haften the third and fourth Partof which the third is a Diophantus in Speciess with many other excellent Problems of thelike nature and th e fourth consists partly of Geometrical Theorems and Problemsmany whereof are practical in Mensurationpartly but principallyof the AnalaticalCalculation and Geometrical constructions of Problems arising thence demonstrated after wards out of the Elementsaccording to the custom of theAn tientsconcealing the Method of Invention as is asserted by many for the magnifying of their Inventions as if there had been no such thing as Algebra known or used Besidesit will doubtless induce the Learned to communi cate their Notions and Collections of much excellent know ledg that lyeth strangely scatterd in print in the most abstruse parts of Geometry as in the Conical Doctrine Angular Secti ons Solid and Curvilinear Geometryand Local determinati ons about which we shall not further trouble the Reader or ourselvestill we find the success of this which is now extant An addition to the aboverelated Experiments made with the Bloodstaunching liquor SInce the aboverecited Experiments were printed the Publisher received information that with the same liquor there have been made two successful Operations upon two se veral Personsa Woman and aManby applying it to the place from whence a leg of each of them was cut off to prevent a gangreneOf which the particulars not being yet given in we must refer them to another opportunityif they shall be found so considerable as to deserve to be described at large

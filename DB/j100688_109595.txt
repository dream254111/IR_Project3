J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109595,CONCERNING THE STATE IN WHICH THE TRUE SAP OF TREES IS DEPOSITED DURING WINTER,I207043,172 AND REPULSIONS OF FLOATING BODIES THESE ATTRACTIONS ARE FOUND TO VARY ULTIMATELY IN THE INLVERSE RATIO OF THE SQUARES OF THE DISTANCES AND THEY APPEAR TO BE THE SAME AS ARE FOUND TO CAUSE AN APPARENT CO HESION BETWEEN ANY MOISTENED SURFACES NEARLY IN CONTACT THE MAG NITUDE OF THIS COHESION AS MEASURED IN A PARTICULAR CASE BY MORVEAU BEING FOUND TO AGREE WITH THE CALCULATION OF THE EFFECT OF CAPILLARY ACTION THE ATTRACTION OF A DROP OF A FLUID TOWARDS THE LINE OF CONTACT OF TWO PLATES OF GLASS WHICH WAS FOUND BY HAWKESBEE TO VARY NEARLY IN THE INVERSE RATIO OF THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE OF THE PLATES WAS SUPPOSED BY NEWTON TO INDICATE AN IMMEDIATE COHESIVE FORCE VARYING IN THE SIMPLE INVERSE RATIO BUT DR YOUNG HAS SHOWN THAT THE FUN DAMENTAL LAW OF THE EQUABLE TENSION OF THE SURFACE IS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON AND TO REMOVE THE APPARENT IRREGULARITY IN THE LAWS OF COHESIVE FORCES THE EQUABLE TENSION OF THE SURFACE IS SHOWN TO BE A CONSEQUENCE WHICH MAY BE MATHEMATICALLY DEDUCED FROM THE EXISTENCE OF A STABLE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE FORCES OF REPULSION AND OF COHESION WHICH IS A NECESSARY CONDITION OF LIQUIDITY AS THE REPULSIVE FORCE ALWAYS VARIES MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE COHESIVE FORCE THE MUTUAL ATTRACTIONS OF SOLIDS AND FLUIDS ARE THEN CONSIDERED AND DR YOUNG AGREES WITH CLAIRAUT ALTHOUGH UPON DIFFERENT GROUNDS IN AFFIRMING THAT A FLUID WILL BE ELEVATED WHEN IN CONTACT WITH ANY SOLID OF MORE THAN HALF ITS ATTRACTIVE DENSITY THE TENSION OF THE COMMON SURFACES OF A SOLID AND A FLUID OR OF TWO CONTINUOUS FLUIDS IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE DIFFERENCE OF THE ATTRACTIVE DENSITIES AND THIS SUPPOSITION IS CONFIRMED BY SOME OBSERVATIONS WITH WHICH THE PAPER IS CONCLUDED ON THE PHENOMENA OF OILY SUBSTANCES FLOATING ON WATER CONCERNING THE STATE IN WHICH THE TRUE SAP OF TREES IS DEPOSITED DURING WINTER IN A LETTER FROM THOMAS ANDREW KNIGHT ESQ TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART KB PRS READ JANUARY 24 1805 PHIL TRANS 1805 P 88 THIS PAPER MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A CONTINUATION OF MR KNIGHTS FORMER COMMUNICATIONS RESPECTING THE MOTION OF THE SAP IN TREES DU HAMEL AND OTHER SUBSEQUENT NATURALISTS HAVE SHOWN THAT TREES CONTAIN TWO KINDS OF SAP AND THE CHIEF PURPOSE OF MR KNIGHTS PAPER IS TO PROVE THAT ONE OF THEM CALLED BY DU HAMEL SUC PROPRE AND BY MR KNIGHT THE TRUE SAP IS GENERATED IN THE LEAF AND THAT THIS FLUID IN AN INSPISSATED STATE OR SOME CONCRETE SUBSTANCE DEPO SITED BY IT EXISTS DURING THE WINTER IN THE ALBURNUM FROM WHICH SUBSTANCE DISSOLVED IN THE ASCENDING AQUEOUS SAP IS DERIVED THE MATTER WHICH ENTERS INTO THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEW LEAVES IN THE SPRING TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED DEPOSITION MR KNIGHT ATTRIBUTES THE WELLKNOWN SUPERIORITY OF WINTERFELLED WOOD WHICH SUPERIORITY HAS GENERALLY BEEN SUPPOSED OWING MERELY TO THE ABSENCE OF THE SAP AT THAT SEASON DU HAMEL HAS REMARKED THAT TREES PERSPIRE MORE WHEN THE LEAVES173 ARE FULL GROWN AND WHEN THE ANNUAL SHOOTS HAVE CEASED TO ELONGATE THAN AT ANY EARLIER PERIOD THIS ENERGY IN THE POWERS OF VEGETATION MUST CERTAINLY MR KNIGHT THINKS BE EMPLOYED IN SOME VERY IM PORTANT OPERATION HE HAS OBSERVED THAT THE PRODUCE OF HIS MEADOWS HAS BEEN GREATLY INCREASED WHEN THE HERBAGE OF THE PRECEDING YEAR HAD BEEN LEFT TILL THE END OF AUTUMN ON GROUND THAT HAD BEEN MOWED EARLY IN THE SUMMER FROM WHICH HE HAS BEEN LED TO IMAGINE THAT LEAVES ARE EMPLOYED DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE SUMMER IN THE PRE PARATION OF MATTER CALCULATED TO AFFORD FOOD TO THE BUDS AND BLOSSOMS OF THE SUCCEEDING SPRING IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FOREGOING OPINIONS WERE WELL FOUNDED OR NOT MR KNIGHT MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS HAVING MADE INCISIONS IN THE TRUNKS OF SYCAMORE AND BIRCHTREES SOME OF THESE INCISIONS BEING CLOSE TO THE GROUND OTHERS AT THE ELE VATION OF SEVEN FEET HE FOUND THAT THE SAP OBTAINED FROM THE SYCA MORE CLOSE TO THE GROUND WAS OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF 1004 WHILE THAT OBTAINED AT THE HEIGHT OF SEVEN FEET HAD A SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF 1 008 THE SAP OF THE BIRCH WAS SOMEWHAT LIGHTER BUT THE INCREASE OF SPE CIFIC GRAVITY AT DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS WAS COMPARATIVELY THE SAME THE SAP OF BOTH THESE TREES WHEN EXTRACTED NEAR THE GROUND WAS ALMOST VOID OF TASTE BUT WHEN OBTAINED AT A GREATER HEIGHT IT WAS SENSIBLY SWEET IN ONE INSTANCE IT WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE SYCAMORETREE AT THE HEIGHT OF TWELVE FEET IT WAS THEN VERY SWEET AND ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WAS 1012 MR KNIGHT THEN MADE AN EXPERIMENT TO COMPARE THE SAP OBTAINED FROM A RECENT INCISION WITH THAT OBTAINED FROM AN OLD ONE HE FOUND THAT THE SAP FROM AN OLD INCISION WAS REDUCED IN SPECIFIC GRAVITY TO 1002 WHILE THAT FROM THE RECENT INCISION CONTINUED AT 1004 AS BEFORE THESE INCISIONS WERE MADE IN A SYCAMORETREE AND WERE CLOSE TO THE GROUND SOME OBSERVATIONS THEN FOLLOW ON THE VARIATION IN THE SPECIFIC GRA VITY OF THE ALBURNUM AT DIFFERENT SEASONS AFTER TAKING EVERY PRE CAUTION TO AVOID ERROR THE AUTHOR FOUND THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF WINTER FELLED OAK TO BE 0679 AND THAT OF SUMMERFELLED OAK TO BE 0X609 AFTER THEY HAD BOTH BEEN IMMERSED FIVE MINUTES IN WATER THIS DIF FERENCE APPEARING TO MR KNIGHT VERY CONSIDERABLE HE REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT SEVERAL TIMES BUT FOUND NO REASON TO SUSPECT ANY ERROR IN IT AND UPON MEASURING PIECES OF BOTH KINDS OF WOOD WHICH WERE EQUAL IN WEIGHT IT APPEARED THAT THE WINTERFELLED PIECES WERE MUCH LESS THAN THE OTHERS THE MORE RECENTLY FORMED LAYERS OF WINTER FELLED WOOD HAD A SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF 0583 THAT OF THE SUMMERFELLED WOOD WAS ONLY 0 533 IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT THE FORMER WAS 0 588 THE LATTER 0 534 ON POURING BOILING WATER ON EQUAL QUANTITIES OF SUMMER AND OF WINTERFELLED WOOD IT APPEARED THAT THE LATTER COMMUNICATED A MUCH DEEPER COLOUR TO THE WATER THAN THE FORMER IT ALSO RAISED THE SPE CIFIC GRAVITY OF THE WATER TO 1002 THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE OTHER INFUSION WAS OL001 MR KNIGHT THOUGHT HE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE MATTER DE174 POSITED IN THE ALBURNUM SOMETIMES REMAINS UNEMPLOYED DURING SE VERAL SUCCESSIVE YEARS HE THEREFORE CUT OFF IN THE WINTER ALL THE BRANCHES OF A LARGE AND VERY OLD PEARTREE AT A SMALL DISTANCE FROM THE TRUNK AND PARED OFF AT THE SAME TIME ALL THE LIFELESS EXTERNAL BARK NO MARKS OF VEGETATION APPEARED TILL THE BEGINNING OF JULY FOLLOWING WHEN NUMEROUS BUDS AND LEAVES OF LARGE SIZE APPEARED AND IN AUTUMN EVERY PART WAS COVERED WITH VERY VIGOROUS SHOOTS THE NUMBER OF LEAVES APPEARED TO MR KNIGHT TO EXCEED VERY MUCH THE WHOLE OF THOSE THE TREE HAD BORNE IN THE THREE PRECEDING YEARS MR KNIGHT SAYS THAT HE HAS REPEATED WITH SUCCESS THE EXPERI MENTS OF BONNET AND DU HAMEL AND THAT HE IS IN POSSESSION OF MANY OTHER FACTS WHICH LIKE THOSE EXPERIMENTS TEND TO PROVE THAT SEEDLING TREES DEPEND AT FIRST ENTIRELY ON THE NUTRIMENT AFFORDED BY THE CO TYLEDONS AND THAT THEY ARE GREATLY INJURED AND OFTEN KILLED BY BEING PUT TO VEGETATE IN RICH MOULD HE THINKS THERE IS VERY DECISIVE EVI DENCE THAT BULBOUS AND TUBEROUSROOTED PLANTS CONTAIN WITHIN THEM SELVES THE MATTER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY COMPOSES THEIR LEAVES ALSO THAT IT APPEARS EXTREMELY PROBABLE THAT THE BLOSSOMS OF TREES RECEIVE THEIR NUTRIMENT FROM THE ALBURNUM PARTICULARLY AS THE BLOSSOMS OF MANY PLANTS PRECEDE THEIR LEAVES MR KNIGHT ALSO THINKS THE EXISTENCE OF A VEGETABLE CIRCULATION THOUGH DENIED BY MANY EMINENT NATURALISTS MUST BE ADMITTED HE SUPPOSES THAT WHEN A SEED IS PLACED IN A PROPER SITUATION FOR VEGE TATION WATER IS ABSORBED BY THE COTYLEDONS AND A YOUNG RADICLE IS EMITTED THIS INCREASES IN LENGTH BY THE ADDITION OF NEW MATTER TO ITS APEX NOT BY ANY GENERAL DISTENSION OF ITS VESSELS OR FIBRES WHICH NEW MATTER APPEARS FROM THE EXPERIMENTS OF BONNET AND DU HAMEL TO DESCEND FROM THE COTYLEDONS THE FIRST MOTION THEREFORE OF THE FLUIDS IS DOWNWARDS TOWARDS THE POINT OF THE ROOT AND THE VESSELS WHICH CARRY THOSE FLUIDS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND IN THE BARK IN SUPPORT OF THIS OPINION HE MENTIONS SOME OB SERVATIONS HE HAS MADE ON THE PROGRESSIVE CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE RADICLE OF THE HORSECHESTNUT FROM THESE IT APPEARS THAT WHEN THE ROOTS WERE CONSIDERABLY ELONGATED AND NOT TILL THENALBUR NOUS TUBES WERE FORMED AND THAT AS SOON AS THESE TUBES HAD ACQUIRED A SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF FIRMNESS THEY APPEARED TO BEGIN THEIR OFFICE OF CARRYING UP THE AQUEOUS SAP AT WHICH TIME AND NOT SOONER THE LEAVES OF THE PLUMULA EXPANDED WHEN THE LEAF HAS ATTAINED ITS PROPER GROWTH IT SEEMS TO PERFORM PRECISELY THE OFFICE OF THE COTY LEDON BEING FED BY THE ALBURNOUS TUBES AND CENTRAL VESSELS AND THE TRUE SAP IS DISCHARGED FROM THE LEAF AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY FROM THE COTYLEDON INTO THE VESSELS OF THE BARK HERE ONE PART OF IT PRODUCES THE NEW LAYER OF WOOD OR NEW EPIDERMIS WHEN THAT IS TO BE FORMED AND THE REMAINING PART ENTERS THE PORES OF THE WOOD ALREADY FORMED AND MIXES WITH THE ASCENDING AQULEOUS SAP THE AUTHOR THINKS IT PROBABLE THAT THE TRUE SAP UNDERGOES A CON SIDERABLE CHANGE ON ITS MIXTURE WITH THE ASCENDING AQUEOUS SAP AS IN THE SYCAMORE IT WAS FOUND TO BECOME MORE SENSIBLY SWEET IN ITS PROGRESS IN THE ROOT IN THE SPRING ALTHOUGH HE COULD NEVER DETECT175 THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE OF SWEETNESS IN DECOCTIONS OF THE WOOD IN WINTER HE THEREFORE IS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE SACCHARINE MATTER IS GE NERATED BY A PROCESS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE GERMINATION OF SEEDS AND THAT THE SAID PROCESS IS ALWAYS GOING ON DURING THE SPRING AND SUM MER BUT THAT TOWARDS THE CONCLUSION OF THE SUMMER THE TRUE SAP SIMPLY ACCUMULATES IN THE ALBURNUM AND THUS ADDS TO THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF WINTERFELLED WOOD AND INCREASES THE QUANTITY OF ITS EX TRACTIVE MATTER HE SAYS ALSO THAT HE HAS SOME REASONS FOR THINKING THAT THE TRUE SAP DESCENDS THROUGH THE ALBURNUM AS WELL AS THROUGH THE BARK AND THAT HE HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT IF THE BARK BE TAKEN FROM THE TRUNKS OF TREES IN THE SPRING AND SUCH TREES BE SUFFERED TO GROW TILL THE FOLLOWING WINTER THE ALBURNUM ACQUIRES A GREAT DEGREE OF HARDNESS AND DURABILITY MR KNIGHT CONCLUDES BY OBSERVING THAT HE CONCEIVES HIMSELF TO BE IN POSSESSION OF FACTS WHICH PROVE THAT BOTH BUDS AND ROOTS ORI GINATE FROM THE ALBURNOUS SUBSTANCE OF PLANTS AND NOT AS HE BELIEVES IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED FROM THE BARK ON THE ACTION OF PLATINA AND MERCURY UPON EACH OTHER BY RICHARD CHENEVIX ESQ FRS MRIA C READ JANUARY 10 1805 PHIL TRANS 1805 P 104 MR CHENEVIX IN THE MONTH OF MAY 1803 PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY A PAPER WHICH WAS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR THAT YEAR RESPECTING THE NATURE OF A METALLIC SUBSTANCE WHICH HAD BEEN OFFERED TO THE PUBLIC AS A NEW SIMPLE METAL UNDER THE NAME OF PALLADIUM IN THAT PAPER HE NOT ONLY ATTEMPTED TO PROVE THAT THE SAID SUBSTANCE INSTEAD OF BEING A SIMPLE METAL WAS MERELY A COM POUND OF PLATINA AND MERCURY BUT HE ALSO DESCRIBED CERTAIN PROCESSES BY WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENABLED TO PRODUCE IT HE NOW EXPRESSES HIS MORTIFICATION TO LEARN THAT THE PROCESSES HE THERE RECOMMENDED AS THE LEAST LIKELY TO FAIL HAVE BEEN GENERALLY UNSUCCESSFUL AND CON FESSES HE HAS REASON TO BELIEVE  THAT THE NATURE OF PALLADIUM IS CON SIDERED BY MOST CHEMISTS AS UNASCERTAINED AND THAT THE FIXATION OF MERCURY BY PLATINA IS BY MANY REGARDED AS VISIONARY IN FRANCE HE SAYS THE COMPOUND NATURE OF PALLADIUM HAS BEEN MORE GENERALLY CREDITED M GUYTON WHO WAS APPOINTED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE TO MAKE A REPORT UPON MR CHENEVIXS EXPERIMENTS HAVING REPEATED SOME OF THEM AND HAVING BEEN LED BY THE RESULTS TO THE SAME GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AS MR CHENEVIX MESSRS FOURCROY AND VAUQUELIN ALSO MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS UPON THE SUBJECT BUT AS ABOUT THIS TIME A NEW METAL HAD BEEN DIS COVERED IN CRUDE PLATINA BY MONS DESCOTILS THE ABOVEMENTIONED CHEMISTS WERE LED TO SUPPOSE IT PROBABLE THAT THE NEW METAL WAS CONCERNED IN THE PRODUCTION OF PALLADIUM AND FINALLY DECLARED AS THEIR OPINION THAT THE SUBSTANCE CALLED PALLADIUM DOES NOT CONTAIN MERCURY BIUT IS FORMED OF PLATINA AND THE NEW METAL OF M DESCOTILS MR CHENEVIX ADDUCES SEVERAL ARGUMENTS TO SHOW THAT THIS OPINION IS NOT WELL FOUNDED AND IN THE LATTER PART OF HIS PAPER HE SAYS THAT

ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED VOLUMES ON HIS SHELVES WOULD TELL ME THAT THOSE CONTAINED A SMALL PART OF IT THAT THE REST WAS EITHER UNWRITTEN OR MIGHT BE FOUND IN LONDON OR NEW YORK OR THAT IT WAS SHUT UP IN THE BREASTS OF THE JUDGES AT WESTMINSTER HALL IF I SHOULD ASK HIM TO EXAMINE HIS BOOKS AND GIVE ME THE INFORMATION WHICH THE LAW ITSELF OUGHT TO HAVE AFFORDED HE WOULD HINT THAT HE LIVED BY HIS PROFESSION

OTHERWISE WOULD BE CONTRARY TO COMMON SENSE REASON AND TRUTH SEE LAWSON PRES EV P 6  IN THE CASE AT BAR IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT THE ACCUSED IS NOT PLEADING HIS OWN IGNORANCE OF THE LAW AS A DEFENSE NOR THE IGNORANCE OF THE PROSECUTRIX BUT IS ATTEMPTING TO SHIELD HIMSELF FROM PUNISHMENT BY CONTENDING THAT THE PROSECUTRIX SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY HIS FALSE REPRESENTATION BECAUSE UNDER THE LAW SHE WAS BOUND TO KNOW OF ITS FALSITY HE CANNOT AVAIL HIMSELF OF SUCH DEFENCE FOR THE REASON THAT AS BEFORE STATED NO SUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW IS IMPUTED TO HER AN EXCELLENT DISCUSSION OF THIS

TO SUBJECT DEBTS DUE TO NONRESIDENTS WITHOUT PERSONAL SERVICE OR APPEARANCE IF HOWEVER THE SITUS OF A DEBT DUE BY A VIRGINIA CITIZEN TO A CITIZEN OF ANOTHER STATE IS NOT IN VIRGINIA BUT IN SLCHL OTHER

VIEWS OF THIS SUBJECT MAIN TAINED BY THE COURTS OF THE DIFFERENT STATES THE THEORY OF THE VIRGINIA STATUIE IS THAT THE SITUS OF THE DEBT DUE BY A CITIZEN OF VIRGINIA TO A NONRESIDENT IS IN VIRGINIA WHILE FOR EXAMPLE THE ACCEPTED VIEW IN ALABAMA IS THAT THE PROPER SITUS OF A DEBT DUE BY A VIRGINIAN TO AN ALABAMA CITIZEN IS IN ALABAMA HENCE WHERE A CREDITOR OF THE ALABAMA CITIZEN BRINGS HIS ACTION IN VIRGINIA AND AT TACHES THE DEBT DUE BY THE VIRGINIA DEBTOR THE VIRGINIA STATUTE WOULD COMPEL THE DEBTOR HERE TO PAY OVER THE MONEY TO THE ATTACHING CREDITOR NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT IF HE HAS PROPERTY IN ALABAMA OR SHOULD EVER GO WITHIN THE BOUN DARIES OF THAT STATE HE IS LIABLE TO BE COMPELLED TO PAY THE DEBT A SECOND TIME 1898 NOTES OF CASES 401

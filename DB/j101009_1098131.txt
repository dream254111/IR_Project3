j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098131,Situs of Debt for Purpose of Garnishment,i245852,If I should apply to a lawyer for a book that contains it he would smile at my ignorance and pointing to about five hundred volumes on his shelves would tell me that those contained a small part of it that the rest was either unwritten or might be found in London or New York or that it was shut up in the breasts of the judges at Westminster Hall If I should ask him to examine his books and give me the information which the law itself ought to have afforded he would hint that he lived by his profession and that the knowledge he had acquired by hard study for mapy years could not be gratuitously imparted  Certainty in the law has hardly increased since Lord Mansfieds time and Mr Livingstons lawyer would today point to a library of 5000 instead of 500 vol umes We may therefore safely agree with Mr Justice Maule that there is no presumption that every person knows the law and that to rule otherwise would be contrary to common sense reason and truth See Lawson Pres Ev p 6  In the case at bar it will be observed that the accused is not pleading his own ignorance of the law as a defense nor the ignorance of the prosecutrix but is attempting to shield himself from punishment by contending that the prosecutrix should not have been deceived by his false representation because under the law she was bound to know of its falsity He cannot avail himself of such defence for the reason that as before stated no such knowledge of the law is imputed to her An excellent discussion of this subject is found in Keener on QuasiContracts 85 et seq See also a note by Prof Graves in 2 Va Law Reg 62 Webb v Alex andria 33 Gratt 168 Throckmorton v Throckmorton 91 Va 42 50 note to Black v Ward Mich 15 Am Rep 171184 note to Alabama c R Co v Jones Miss 55 Am St Rep 495520 SITUS OF DEBT FOR PURPOSE OF GARNISHMENTIn Louisville c R Co v Nash 23 South 825 the Supreme Court of Alabama in a learned opinion by Brickell C J decides that the courts of one State have no jurisdiction to gar nish a debt due to a nonresident and payable where he resides except in the case of personal service on or voluntary appearance by the nonresident creditor In other words that the situs of the debt is in the State of the creditor Any attempt says Judge Brickell to reconcile the conflicting authorities on the question of the situs of a debt for the purpose of garnishment would be vain but analogy as well as reason and justice to the creditor would seem to fix it at the domicile of the creditor and forbid its seizure or any change in the ownership thereof by the law or procedure of any other State It is now well settled that a debt due by an insolvent to a nonresident is property within the creditors State and that no law or decree of the debtors State discharging his debts can operate to discharge the debt due to the nonresident Brown v Smart 145 U S 454 Denny v Bennett 128 U S 489 Pattee v Paige 163 Mass 352 40 N E 108 Bank v Batcheller 151 Mass 589 24 N E 917 Wilson v Jfatthews 32 Ala 345 It is equally well settled that for the purpose of taxa tion a debt has its situs at the domicile of the creditor State Tax on Foreignheld Bonds 15 Wall 300 Kirtland v Hotchkiss 100 U S 491 In re Bronsons Estate 150 N Y 1 44 N E 707 Potter v Ross 23 N J Law 517 Boyd v City of Selma 96 Ala

debtors in any sense They are obligations of the debtors and only possess value in the hands of the creditorswith them are property and in their hands they may be taxed To call debts property of the debtors is simply to misuse terms All the property there can be in the nature of things in the debts of corporations belongs to the creditors to whom they are payable and fol lows their domicile whatever they may be Their debts can have no locality separate from the parties to whom they are due We are unable to perceive any sound reason for giving to a debt a different situs for the purpose of garnishment and none satisfactory to us has been offered by those decisions which give it a different situs for this purpose only If a debt due to a nonresident cannot be discharged by an insolvency law or decree of the debtors State because of a want of jurisdiction over the creditor and the debt a like reason should forbid its discharge by garnisliment proceedings Those courts which adhere to the contrary view are not themselves in accord as to to the theory upon which they can acquire jurisdiction over such debts In some it is held that for the purpose of garnishment a State has the power to fix the situs of a debt at the domicile of the debtor although the creditor be a non resident Williams v Incgersoll 89 N Y 508 Douglass v Insurance Co 138 N Y 209 33 N E 938 Bragg v Gaynor 85 Wis 468 55 N W 919 As we have seen above the exercise of such power would be a nullity in its effect upon the person of a nonresident or the debt due him Others hold that the situs of a debt is wherever a suit may be maintained to recover it Harvey v Railwoay Co 50 Minn 406 52 N W 905 Manufacturing Co v Lang 127 Mo 242 29 S W 1010 As a general proposition this as we have seen is incorrect and as limited and applied to garnishments only it seems to us merely an arbitrary dis tinction Moreover if its situs is in the State of the debtor only by reason of the fact that a suit to recover it may there be maintained a debt due by a foreign corporation doing business in a State other than that of its creation to a non resident of such State could not be reached by a garnishment sued out in the State in the absence of a statute expressly authorizing it to be sued therein on a cause of action arising without the State for it is well settled as a general rule that no action in personam can be maintained against a foreign corporation unless the contract sued on was made or was to be performed or the injury complained of was suffered in the State in which the action is brought Railroad Co v Carr 76 Ala 388 St Clair v Cox 106 U S 350 And it has been expressly held that a nonresident creditor of a corporation cannot have his property in a debt seized in a State to which the corporation may resort merely for the purpose of doing business through its agents when the claim arose on a contract not to be per formed within the State of suit Reimers v Manufacturing Co 17 C C A 228 70 Fed 573 Douglass v Insurance Co 138 N Y 209 33 N E 938 We prefer to adhere to the principle upon which our former cases were decided that the situs of a debt is at the domicile of the creditor for the purpose of garnish ment as well as for other purposes Railroad Co v Dooley 78 Ala 524 Railroad Co v Chumley 92 Ala 317 9 South 286 Reno Nonres sec 138 et seq Rail road Co v Smith 70 Miss 344 12 South

situs of the debt due from appellant to ap 400 Octpellee we are constrained by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States cited above to hold that the judgment of the Tennessee court operating as it did on its face to condemn and devest appellees property in the debt over which it had not acquired jurisdiction by personal service within the State on ap pellee or by his voluntary appearance was without due process of law and abso lutely void for want of jurisdiction of the res the debt or of the person of its owner To such judgments the Constitution of the United States does not re quire that any faith and credit be given the constitutional provision that full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts records and judi cial proceedings of every other State and the act of Congress providing for the mode of authenticating such acts records and proceedings being now construed as applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subjectmatter and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subjectmatter Pen noyer v Neff supra The question is discussed at length in an article by H Dent Minor of the Memphis Tenn bar in 1 Va Law Reg 241 See also OConner v Walter Neb 40 Am St Rep 487 and note Singer Mlfg Co v Fleming Neb 42 Am St Rep 633 and note National Fire Ins Co v Chambers N J  32 Atl 663 In the recent Virginia case of Virginia Fire  Mnarine Ins Co v N   Carousal Mfg Co 28 S E 888 a debt due by a Virginia corporation to a citizen of North Carolina was attached in Virginia by a creditor of the North Carolina creditor and there seems to have been no personal service of process on or appearance by the latter The question of the situs of the debt and the jurisdiction of the Virginia court to subject it would therefore seem to have been involved though so far as the opinion discloses it was not raised The Virginia statute in the plainest terms confers jurisdiction in such cases Va Code secs 2959 subsec 1 2979 3609 and it is common practice in Virginia to subject debts due to nonresidents without personal service or appearance If however the situs of a debt due by a Virginia citizen to a citizen of another State is not in Virginia but in slchl other State then it is clear that the nonresident creditor is not bound by the judgment in the attachment proceeding and the debtor may be compelled to pay it again If the debtor by satisfying the judgment in the attachment or garnishment proceeding is not protected against a subsequent proceeding by the creditor himself there may be serious question whether under the doctrine of Pennoyer v NeJC 95 U S 714 and the long line of cases following it the Virginia statute is not unconstitutional Certainly the existing state of the law is in a very unsatisfactory condition by reason of the conflicting views of this subject main tained by the courts of the different States The theory of the Virginia statuie is that the situs of the debt due by a citizen of Virginia to a nonresident is in Virginia while for example the accepted view in Alabama is that the proper situs of a debt due by a Virginian to an Alabama citizen is in Alabama Hence where a creditor of the Alabama citizen brings his action in Virginia and at taches the debt due by the Virginia debtor the Virginia statute would compel the debtor here to pay over the money to the attaching creditor notwithstanding the fact that if he has property in Alabama or should ever go within the boun daries of that State he is liable to be compelled to pay the debt a second time 1898 NOTES OF CASES 401

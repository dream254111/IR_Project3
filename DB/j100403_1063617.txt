j100403,Virginia Law Review,1063617,Some Views on the Rule of Stare Decisis,i243784,SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS THE most characteristic feature of the jurisprudence of the English speaking race is the rule of stare decisisor stated in broadest terms that courts follow previous decisions So long and so deeply has this principle been imbedded in the thought and practice of English and American courts and law yers that we of the profession have long since ceased to inquire what was its origin or what is its true significance or to ques tion its wisdom But while we are convinced of the utility of the rule and are ready to defend it against assaults from whatever source it is a favorite topic for animadversion by lay critics and we our selves must concede that in its practical administration it some times produces results well calculated to incur the protest of even its most ardent devotees It may be well therefore briefly to consider some aspects of the rule and its practical administration In selecting this almost threadbare topic for discussion before so notable a body of lawyers as compose this Association I can not hope to add anything to your knowledge of it It has been the daily companion of the oldest of you during the whole of your professional lives and to the youngest recruit a case in point is the readiest weapon of offense or of defense The most helpless category in which the average lawyer can be placed is to find himself in court with no case upon which he may rely as a precedent As trite as the topic is I have selected it for my address for several reasons First because no sane speaker would be expected to exhaust it at a single sitting on a warm day in Julyand hence I may feel at liberty to expand or contract or omit as time or inclination may suggest Secondly because the precise scope of the rule is simetimes misunderstood or over looked by lawyers and even judgesand a refreshing of our minds on the subject may prove helpful And lastly because the Annual address by Dean W M Lile before the Alabama State Bar Association July 1916 95VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW topic easily leads up into bypaths along which we may wander at random without too serious a departure from our announced itinerary It will be observed that the title of my paper is Some Views of the rule purposely chosen to justify its discursive character ORIGIN For present purposes it does not matter how or when the rule originatedwhether in obsequious deference to the judg ments of royalty who originally sat as judgesor from the nat ural disposition of the human mind to follow beaten paths and the line of least resistanceor from the not unreasonable pre sumption that previous decisions are generally rightor from the indisposition of the courts to retry questions it sit finis litium or finally from the yielding to necessity in the interest of cer tainty and stabilitythough doubtless all of these were contrib uting causes Another contributing cause must have been the absence of a written code and the very nature of the common law as existing only in traditional customs Our rule has no existence in the civil law of continental Eu rope Indeed the laws of several of the European states ex pressly declare that previous decisions shall not have the force of law and in none of them so far as I am aware are such former decisions regarded as imperative precedents in future cases I think we may account for this in the existence in these European states of their civil codes in which the laws have been scientifically formulated upon the basis of the Roman law itself a highly developed system long before our ancestors left the forests of Germany or for their diet of raw fish had sub stituted the good roast beef and brown stout of Merrie England Such codes have been potent influences in securing uniformity and certainty in the law and in reducing to a minimum the ex ercise of the judicial discretion in its interpretation But even under that system precedents are regarded as instructive and highly persuasivebut in so far only as they seem sound expo sitions of the law In other words their value depends on their intrinsic merits 96SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS Under the common law system however lacking as it does a scientifically constructed code as a basis or indeed any code in a true sense we are ex necessitate more dependent on the in fluence of previous decisions If we strip these of all mandatory force our unwritten law would be evidenced by no authoritative declaration and every court from the lowest to the highest would be law unto itself The rule of stare decisis is therefore a rule of necessity and a natural evolution from the very nature of our institutions THE SCOPE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RULE It seems proper at this point to consider the scope and signifi cance of the rule In what form should it be expressed What is its true import How imperative is its mandate If one were called upon as I hope I shall never be to give scientific expression to the rule in the form of a statute or of a constitutional enactment the task would be a most uninviting one and the result most likely disappointing Courts and commentators have made little or no effort to ex press it in other than the vaguest and most nebulous form from which its Latin garbstare decisis et non qtieta moveredoes not rescue it Possibly for this vagueness of form we may find good reason in the course of our rambles about the ancient land mark I think that a fairly accurate statement of the rule expressed in general terms and as commonly received by the profession would be this A decision by a court of last resort in a litigated controversy on a question of law necessarily involved in the judgment becomes a precedent within that jurisdiction for sub sequent cases involving substantially similar facts This of course excludes the decisions of courts foreign to the jurisdic tion and decisions of inferior domestic courts Obviously this is an unsatisfying statement since it leaves un touched the real point of difficulty namely What is the signifi cance of the term precedent And how authoritative is the precedent Is it merely strong prina facie evidence of the law or is it as imperative as a legislative enactmentor does it oc cupy some middle ground between these 2 97VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Assuming for the present that a given decision is an impera tive authority for some doctrine of law how is the precise sig nificance of the doctrine thus established to be determined from the opinion and proceedings Failure on the part of counsel and of the court to give careful attention here is a fruitful source of error in judicial decisions Clearly the decision only becomes a precedent for the point or points actually arising on the facts of the particular case and necessary to the disposition of the case To ascertain with nicety and precision the true import of a particular decisionwhat we may term the doctrine of the caserequires a careful study of the facts This doctrine is determined not by what the court said but what the court necessarily decided The court may not by any words that it may use in its opinion alter the doctrine of the case The moment the court departs from the precise principle involved from that moment it speaks extrajudicially and no opinion that it may express is authorita tive If the courts powers be legislativea question to be touched upon laterit may legislate only for the particular case with its accompanying factsor if its role be that of discovery it may discover only so much as is essential to dispose of that case and no more It may deal only with a situation that has actually arisen in the past and not one that may arise in the fu ture All else is dictumin no sense authoritative and deserv ing only such recognition as the reputation of the judge uttering it may warrant In Cohens v Virginia Chief Justice Marshall said It is a maxim not to be disregarded that general expressions in every opinion are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used If they go beyond the case they may be respected but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is pre sented for decision The reason for this maxim is obvious The question actually before the court is investigated and considered in its full extent Other principles which may serve to illustrate it are considered in their relation to the case decided but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated 6 Wheat 264 399 98SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS To separate the doctrine from the dicta as the chart from the wheat requires a delicate legal sense and a painstaking study of every feature of the case The facts and the judgment play a far more important part here than the opinion itself When the facts and the decisions are compounded and tried in the cruci ble of legal analysis the resultant legal rule is the doctrine of the case whether the doctrine itself be sound or unsound By no use of words can the court extend limit or qualify this re sult As the compounding of certain chemicals produces a cer tain product in spite of the incantations of the chemist and as the tuning fork produces a certain note unaltered by the un cultured ear that hears it or the untrained voice that attempts to reproduce it so the judicial disposition of a case on a fixed state of facts produces a doctrine which the court by no words that it may utter in its opinion can altera doctrine to be ascer tained only by scrutinizing the facts through the medium of the decision A certain combination of notes produces a musical chord The silencing of a single note or the introduction of a new note may produce a more pleasing effect but the old har mony is altered The skill to catch this note and to reproduce it faithfully marks the real artist in the law 2 The doctrine of stare decisis therefore means not that the rule which is to be followed in the future is to be found in the lan guage of the court but in the principle necessarily resulting from the decision AUTHORITATIVENESS Assuming that we have accurately ascertained the true import of our previous decision there recurs the question of its authori tativeness Pursuing our inquiry we shall find that previous decisions are of varying degrees of authoritativeness dependent upon the par ticular circumstances under which they were rendered If for instance the decision was by an evenly divided court it has no force whatever as a precedent but is binding only on the parties to that litigation and if there be a dissenting minority the de cision loses something of its value as a precedentthe greater 2 See the authors article on The Uses and Abuses of Secondary Au thority 1 VA LAW REV 604 616 99VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW the dissent the less potent the precedent and its force is still further reduced by a strong dissenting opinion So where the decision was rendered in a case heard ex parte or in a friendly and not hostile litigationor is based on pre viously discredited authority or on unsustained or rIisunder stood textwritersor has been ignored in the jurisdiction of its originor overlooks and unconsciously overrules one or more prior decisions in the same jurisdictionor in the absence of sustaining local precedents runs counter to settled principles as generally accepted in other jurisdictions and not noticed in the opinionall these considerations tend to weaken or destroy the force of the decision And so a ruling that cannot stand the test of sound reason and is obviously violative of fundamental principles is an excrescence upon the body of the law which sooner or later will slough off and give way to sounder princi ples These are but a few of the multitude of elements that en ter into the proper valuation of a case as a precedent The concession that the circumstances surrounding a particu lar decision may destroy or weaken its force necessarily implies that our rule of stare decisis is not absolute like a statute And the multitude of overruled cases in England and in every Amer ican state attest that the rejection of unsatisfactory precedents has been the conceded prerogative and practice of the courts from the earliest days The considerations which shall justify a court of last resort in overruling its own decisions are not fixed and definite but rest largely in the judicial discretion The power is however practically without other limit than that which the judicial con science may fix The court is the final arbiter of its own pow ers from whose judgment there is no appeal Subject to quali fications to be noticed later the legal right and power to declare one precedent or one line of precedents unsound and to sub stitute a new principle more conformable to the judicial notion of justice or sound policy carries with it the right and power to overrule any precedent or line of precedents if in the delib erate opinion of the court a wise policy demands it What then becomes of our rule A legal mandate which the courts may lawfully disregard is a solecism 100SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS We may conclude therefore that the socalled rule of stare de cisis is not a rule at all in the sense of an imperative mandate but a mere judicial custom or convenient maxim which the courts have evolved for their own guidance and which like all other maxims expresses a general truth only or affords a gen eral guide subject to many variants according to the circum stances under which it is sought to be applied PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE DOCTRINE While there has been much inconsistency in the practical ap plication of the doctrine by the courts the profession is fairly well agreed as to its theoretical significance It is generally agreed for instance that inferior courts are imperatively bound by the decisions of the superior authority And yet no one other than disappointed counsel would charge the judge of the inferior court with the breach of his judicial oath or with an impeachable offense be cause of his refusal to follow a decision of the higher court which in good faith he believes to be in violation of sound principles and an obvious judicial blunder Such rejection by the lower court is often the only means of bringing the ques tion anew to the attention of the appellate court and thus af fording opportunity for a correction of the blunder But apart from any obligation to follow previous rulings of the higher court the consciousness on the part of the inferior court that a departure from precedent is likely to be followed by a reversal is in itself a powerful incentive to conformity How far the appellate court theoretically should follow its own precedents is a simpler question than the inquiry how far appellate courts do follow their own previous decisions in actual practicesince here theory and practice clo not always go hand in hand CASES OF STRICT APPLICATION There is no dissent in theory from the proposition that con siderations of justice and of sound policy most strongly plead for uniformity and certainty where local decisions have estab lished a rule of property or of contractor any other rule in reliance upon which the citizen would naturally plan his future 101VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW conduct whether viewed from the civil or criminal sideor where a sudden departure from former adjudications would disturb the social orderand certainly in every case where a similar departure by statutory enactment would run counter to constitutional restrictions In cases such as these it is better that the law should be certain than always in harmony with legal analogies There are unfortunately many instances to be found in the reports where this salutary principle has been disre garded and grave injustice done Whether the overruling of a decision connotes that the re jected principle never was the law or that it was the law until judicially rejectedin other words whether the courts make the law or simply declare itis a question over which a contest has raged among the legal philosophers since Benthams day and a contest into which I shall not here enter at large But whether we assent to the one theory or the other we know that not in the professional mind only but in lay thought as well for practical purposes an established precedent is received as the law forthat jurisdiction whether by judicial enactment or by judicial discovery and no citizen should suffer in his goods or in his person because he has acted upon a rule that has been solemnly adjudged to be the law by the only tribunal established by the state for that purpose If the people in their sovereign capacity have thought the prin ciple so vital as to need the protection of a constitutional pro hibition against legislative enactments impairing vested rights and against ex post facto laws surely the courts the peculiar guardians of justice should not countenance judgments in de fiance of the principle merely because the written prohibition is addressed to the legislature and not to the courts Injustice loses none of its iniquity because perpetrated under the guise of a judicial decision instead of a legislative enactment In such cases even if the established principle violates what the court now considers sound policy one of two alternatives should be followed For sake of uniformity the existing prin ciple should be retained or for sake of a wiser public policy it may be rejected provided this may be done without prejudice to the parties in the instant case by a violation of the principle 102SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS just mentionedthat is rights privileges or immunities arising in the interval between the establishment and the rejection of the discarded principlerights and immunities which would have been saved to the citizen if the alteration had been effected by legislative instead of by judicial actionshall be governed not by the new but by the old rule In these cases the principle of treating the decisions of the courts as actually establishing the law until overruled and regarding the overruling of decisions as tantamount to the repeal of a statute is receiving more and more practical recognition from the courts Such a principle means of course a repudiation of the theory that an overruled precedent never was the law and a recognition of the theory so ably maintained by Austin and Poimeroy and their followers and what must be apparent to every one who observes the practical working of our judicial systemsthat the courts are in fact the artificers and not merely discoverers of the law Professor Pomeroy whose luminous exposition of this sub ject is to my mind the most satisfying that the controversy nas provoked thus sums up his conclusions3 The common law of England is not now never was and never will be a complete system existing partly in actual precepts and partly in an undefined or cloudy state ready to have the curtain rolled back and the law discovered by judicial action it is rather a power continually reproducing itself taking up fresh material and converting it into new regulations new maxinums new applications in short a new code Without distinctly announcing its adherence to this theory your own court in a well known case has been just enough to vindicate the principle4 In that case a mortgage executed by a married womnan valid under the existing state decisions was held to be a still valid and subsisting security in spite of the circum stance that in the interval between the date of the transaction and the date of the hearing of the appeal in the foreclosure suit the court had in other cases announced a different conclusion as to the validity of such mortgages 3 POMEROY MUNICIPAL L  38 286355 Farrior v Ncw England Mortgage Co 92 Ala 176 9 South 532 103VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW And although the United States Supreme Court has uni formly held that the prohibition of the Federal Constitution against impairing the obligation of contracts is confined to such impairment by legislation or constitutional enactment only and that such impairment by a judicial act is not within the purview of the federal interdict this is rather an interpretation of the language of the Constitution than a vindication of the principle which would sanction the impairment of vested rights by judicial action What view that court may take when the question is fairly presented other than as a jurisdictional one seems fore shadowed in several cases in that court5 In a very late case in Mississippi6 the principle is extended to the domain of the criminal law and a later decision approving a statute previously held unconstitutional was declared ex post facto as to an of fense committed while the former decision was in force The principle that precedents shall be applied so as to make their operation prospective only obviously makes difficulty A rigid insistence upon the principle would in many cases render it impossible to establish the new precedent at all since by the very act of overruling the principle would in the instant case be violated So that the consistency of the principle can only be preserved where the former precedent which we may call A is overruled in a case B in which the transaction arose ante rior to the original precedent Aand the old rule is applied to transactions occurring in the interval between A and B and coming up for decision later than B Further such a principleparticularly in connection with the interpretation of constitutional or statutory enactments in which connection it is of most frequent occurrencemay produce the anomaly of the temporary suspension of a valid constitutional or statutory en actment by judicial actionwith the result for example in the criminal law that of two persons indicted for breach of a crim inal statute both equally guilty of the forbidden act one is legally guilty and the other legally innocent Howsoever illog 6 Gelpcke v Dubuque 1 Wall 175

RULE OF STARE DECISIS ical the result appeals to our sense of justice If it may be justified on no other grounds the principle of estoppel against the court itself or against the state for which the court speaks would seem sufficient WHERE THE RULE Is NoT so STRICT Where on the other hand the overturning of a former decision will not disturb vested rights nor interfere with social order where for example instead of avoiding titles and upsetting contracts or otherwise working injustice through its retrospec tive operation the effect is precisely the oppositeif the court be satisfied that the former decision or even a line of decisions is unsound either because of original inherent error or because of changed conditions the doctrine of stare decisis properly interpreted not only does not forbid the overturning of the old principle and the adoption of a new and sounder rule but rather ill my judgment enjoins it as a duty To deny this right and this duty to the courts is to condemn the methods by which the common law of our day in spite of its many inconsistencies has become what we know it to be a splendid system of jurisprudence and wonderfully suited to the genius of our people A striking feature of the common law is its elasticity and its capacity to mould and adjust itself to new needs and new conditions and thus by constant growth without haste but without rest to keep pace with the enlightened public opinion of the people by whom and for whom it has been fash ioned But it can only be thus moulded and adjusted and shaped to wiser purposes by the courtssince statutory enactments constitute no part of it and if we have learned aught by ex perience it is that our American legislatures are either indiffer ent to the inconsistencies and shortcomings of the law or else are incompetent to remedy them A denial of this judicial function of breaking away from an cient traditions would have left the unwritten law of our pres ent day as it was in the dark ages and we should still find ourselves governed by the crude legal conceptions prevailing in the days of trial by battle or the ordeal of fire Our common law of today is not the common law of Lord Cokes day nor of 105VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Blackstones day nor even of our immediate forefathers As expressed by Mr Justice HolmesT our common law is always approaching and never reaching consistency It is forever adopt ing new principles from life at one end and it always retains the old ones from history at the other which have not yet been sloughed off It will be entirely consistent only when it ceases to grow The trouble has been and is in my judgment not that the courts have done violence to the law by too frequent an exer cise of the power to overrule but by failure to follow a con sistent practice they have erred by overruling when they should not and by refusing to overrule when they should And I am not sure that on the whole our jurisprudence has not suffered more by too strict an adherence to precedent than a departure from it Lest I be considered an iconoclast and a preacher of heresy let me make my position a little clearer I attach a peculiar value to the maxim of stare decisis To my mind when properly un derstood it expresses a wise philosophy A judge who lightly disregards it lacks an essential judicial qualification It is the chief cornerstone of our legal structure Without a proper adherence to its spirit and until some great code maker shall give us our law in better form we should be without compass chart or anchor My point is that in their ultraconservatism the courts are disposed unwarrantably to make a fetish of precedents and blindly to worship them as the Chinese their ancestors and far beyond what the spirit of our rule requires or warrants and that as a result the law lingers far in the rear of that enlight ened public opinion which it should in large measure portray And thus the process of adjustment to new conditions and to newer and more enlightened policies is unreasonably retarded The doctrine that the courts themselves contribute to this moulding and expansion of the law instead of relegating the duty to an indifferent and inactive legislature is regarded as heretical by the great majority of the judges and no doctrine ever came under severer judicial condemnation if we have re  HOLMES COMMON L 36 106SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS gard to the language and not to the action of the courts The court that desires to follow its previous rulings whether because it believes them sound or in order to escape the labor of recon sidering them will be found asserting the rule of standing by previous decisions in most imperative and laudatory terms and declaring itself imperatively bound by what has gone before The same court when confronted with an inconvenient prece dent that stands in the way of what it conceives to be a righteous judgnent in a particular case especially if announced by a predecessor no longer on the bench will be equally eloquent in defending the right and duty to overrule And I believe the statement is well within the truth that those judges whose mem ories are held in highest honor by those of succeeding genera tions are those who have shown least disposition to follow pre cedent blindly The doctrine which we may term that of non stare decisis is equally unpalatable to the average practitioner whose chief con cern from the very nature of his occupation is rather to keep himself advised as to what the law is as declared by the courts than to consider what it ought to be or to lend himself to the task of making it better Nobody doubts that the law made or discovered if the term be preferred by the judges is of a far superior quality to that produced by our legislaturescertainly so far as concerns what we may term private law as distinguished from that of a public or political nature Every proposition of law judicially an nounced has the deliberate consideration of judges with trained legal minds and consciences and the court has the advantage of the argument of counsel who with the life liberty or property of the client at stake and urged by their own personal and pro fessional interests are incited to exhaust every possible argu ment that seems to bear on the question at issue Thus every phase of every question is threshed out in its concrete application and thus the court is supplied with material for a correct con clusion This conclusion when announced unlike a legislative act is accompanied by a statement of the reasons that induced it and the opinion is published and submitted to the whole body of the profession for criticism and finally as a special incentive 107VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW industriously to seek legal truth only the judge who delivers the opinion has the consciousness that his opinion will be embalmed in the imperishable literature of the law as a help or hindrance to future students and investigators long after he has passed from the judicial stage Again the entire body of our judgemade or judgediscovered law other than constitutional interpretations is subject to repeal or alteration at the will of the legislature The function there fore which the courts are exercising and have exercised for centuries as lawgivers seems well guarded against judicial tyranny and in actual results has been on the whole wisely and conscientiously administered If your Association should have a committee of its wisest mem bers to examine your local decisions and to report those that in their opinion seem to violate sound policy the list would be sur prisingly small HINDRANCES TO CORRECT DEVELOPMENT Among the more serious hindrances to the orderly levelop ment of legal truth is the unfortunate habit of courts to wander outside of the record and consciously or unconsciously to essay the adjudication of principles not involved in the case under con sideration These extrajudicial excursions into forbidden terri tory have farreaching and deplorable consequences The re porter inserts both doctrine and dicta in his headnotes the digester follows the reporter the textwriter follows the di gester and from the textbook there is an easy step back into the reports again and this time with the error enthroned as legal truth the bar sinister effaced in the course of the circuit To my mind the halfbaked quality of the modern textbook and the growing disposition of the courts of last resort to rely upon these distinctly untrustworthy compilations as if they were primary sources of the law have been fruitful sources of much of the error and inconsistency of our unwritten law The text writer is confessedly dependent on the courts for every principle he announces That the courts should in turn take their cue from the textwriter would seem a startling proposition to one 108SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS not accustomed to this laborsaving expedient There is of course no surer method of perpetuating error8 Another source of error is the human element in the judges who allow themselves to be swayed from principle by the moral aspect which a particular case presents Judges are prone to for get that in the decision of a controversy between two citizens they are laying down a rule for all citizens of the future Where for example the question is political or quasipolitical the spirit of the party or the spectre of a disapproving popular majority is apt to disturb the even scales of justice So in the construc tion of socalled unnatural wills which violate ones natural sense of justice by the exclusion of those who are nearest in blood or in any case where there is a sharp conflict between the 8 It is universally understood there is indeed no necessity for citing authorities to the proposition that the dicta uttered by the judges in pronouncing their opinion is no part of the authoritative law though the habit of looking into them if not abused is not therefore to be deemed evil But they are among the very lowest evidences of the law Viewed as opinion they are not the opinion of the collective judges but simply of the particular judge speaking And travelling as they do on the outside of the record they are mere gratuitous utterances not in discharge of a duty not necessarily within the investigations of the counsel who have argued the case not in similitude to the writings of a textauthor who if he has done his duty has consulted all the cases and extended his investigations through the entire subject but they are the mere uncalled for overflow of the mind of the lawyer who has not the authorities before him who has only given the subject a super ficial investigation and who in every other respect is without the equip ment for correct speaking And the present writer asks permission to state another thing as the result of more than forty years time spent in the uninterrupted reading of judicial decisions and writing the law thereupon namely that the dicta of judges even of the most eminent ones constitute a huge mass of contradictions piled upon contradictions and that an au thor by skillful selection could write any sort of doctrine on any and every subject of the law by simply repeating the words of the selected dicta and all the fools would praise his book for its marvelous accuracy And this is simply what every lawyer who has learned his profession knows And at the same time it is simply what ninetenths of the law yers including those of them who are on the bench constantly over look It is this overlooking of things which we have seen in other con nections brings disaster to the law BISHOP MARRIAGE DIVORCE AND SEPARATION 1797 109VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW legal and moral aspect of the case the ruling is apt to illustrate the proverb that hard cases make bad laws And in seeking for causes for illdigested conclusions we must not overlook the crowded conditions of the dockets nor the superficial briefs of counsel whose function it is to illumine but whose briefs in too many instances darken the counsel of the court nor the evil of oneman opinions which has already been a subject of consideration by your Association nor the false economy of reducing judicial salaries with the result in many parts of the country that judicial appointment is no longer re garded by the Bar as professional promotion The great private corporations are wiser in their generation They have long since learned that a cheap lawyer is an expensive investment The want of some method by which the errors of the courts may be brought sharply to the judicial mind is in itself a potent predisposing cause of the laissezfaire attitude of many of our courts of final appeal In my judgment much good might be accomplished if there were some method by which decisions of the courts unsatisfactory to the profession might be brought tactfully and in a proper spirit to the judicial notice other than by interested counsel or by an occasional criticism in a textbook or law journal which the offending court probably never sees Criticism from disinterested but competent sources is the most effective method of reaching and maintaining a high state of ex cellence in any department of human learning It is thus only that standards are maintained and the arts and sciences per fected Effective criticism from practicing members of the bar is out of the question whether as individuals or as an associa tion Practitioners are naturally unwilling to incur the displeas use of the court by public criticism of its decisions Furthermore the courts and the public would discount such criticism as the mere arguments of disappointed or partisan advocacy Newspaper and other nonprofessional criticisms are obviously ineffective because of the incompetency of the critics A local law journal devoted chiefly to the local law seems the most effective existing method of reaching the difficulty Such a journal should be conducted by an editorial staff of non practitioners of conceded professional ability and discretion 110SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS an almost impossible combination and scarcely to be found if at all elsewhere than in the law schools of the state The ex periment has been tried in my own state with marked success in the case of the Virginia Law Register and I believe that the Illinois Law Journal under the guidance of Dean Wigmore and the Faculty of the Northwestern University is accomplish ing excellent results in the same direction in that state I do not know how satisfactory your current decisions are though every student of American law knows what splendid contributions to legal truth the courts of this state have made in the past But assuming that the profession of your state as in every other state finds itself chafing over unsound decisions which need to be brought to the sympathetic attention of the court surely such an Association as yours which in various di rections has already shown a distinctly progressive spirit and notably so in its efforts in the domain of legal ethics could solve this problem which equally concerns the jurisprudence of every state Possibly concerted action by the judge of the lower courts if it could be securedin the form of a memorial addressed to the higher courtbacked by such a law journal as I have described would be a practical method But such criticism or such a mem orial from practitioners at the bar even if these could be induced to take concerted action would most probably fall in deaf judi cial earssealed as they too often are by the doctrine of stare decisis PRACTICAL RESULTS Notwithstanding the errors and inconsistencieswhich I may possibly have overemphasizedin the practical results our julge made or judgediscovered law on the whole reflects most cred itably on its authors Our unwritten law when viewed in its entirety is admirably adapted to the habits thoughts and cus toms of our people The uncertainty of the law is a favorite catchphrase of the pessimist and of the uninformed but when considered in its proper perspective and in its practical administration the won der is how little of uncertainty it presents Broadly speaking what seems right is right The average citizen obeys the law 111VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW unconsciously With no knowledge whatever of what the law is he conducts his social and business affairs according to the dic tates of his conscience and of common sense and lives out a long life as a lawabiding citizen without once incurring legal penalties or being driven to the protection of his rights in the courtroom And yet every one of the daily and hourly trans actions of his life contained in it the seeds of a lawsuit If the large amount of litigation in the courts seems to con tradict this suggestion the answer is that the courts are but hospitals of the law into which come not the normal but the abnormal And of these controversies a majority spring not from uncertainty in the law but from a dispute about the facts And even where the normal is litigated the moving cause is generally the partisan zeal of counsel whose judgment is warped by the spirit of advocacy To obtain a fair notion of the health of a community we must visit not the hospitals only but the centres of human industry and the homes of the people and our estimate will be untrust worthy unless we exclude from our computation all disabilities not the result of natural causes A litigated case therefore does not necessarily imply uncer tainty in the legal principles involved nor that the law is in a morbid state When we consider the complexity of our social political and economic situationitself a modern growth and still expanding with marvelous rapidity and giving rise to new problems unknown to our forefathers problems for which the courts must find a solutionthe marvel is that the volume of litigation is so small Finally where real uncertainty exists the difficulty is rather in the application of the desired principle Mathematics is supposed to be a certain science yet the domain of applied math emathics abounds in problems that test the skill of the most scientific engineers architects and builders The school boy may on his slate work out a simply result in addition and multiplica tion to which the most expert engineer and builder with all his instruments of precision cannot with perfect accuracy attain in the actual structure In short there is in every department of human learning a 112SOME VIEWS ON THE RULE OF STARE DECISIS necessary element of uncertainty not the result of natural or artificial laws but born of the limitations of human intelligence and human skill Furthermore the uncertainties in the law are far exceeded by those in the other moral sciences In the regions of politics literature art philosophy medicine and even of religion we find their disciples split into unnumerable cults and schools and flying at each others throats The creed of the one is the dam nable heresy of the other But one looks in vain for sects and schisms among the disciples of the law and such divisions as exist in legal thought are so slight as practically to be obscured by the general harmony In the great and happy family of the law there are no Dem ocrats or Republicans no cubist artists no cults of Browning or Wordsworth or Walt Whitman no contending philosophers no allopaths homeopaths or chiropractors and no Methodist or Baptist or Presbyterian divisions Is it not a fair conclusion therefore that in spite of some un certainties and of some inconsistencies and of many difficulties of application our judgemade law based on the spirit but not bound to the letter of our maxim is on the whole a wise uni form comprehensive and understandable body of jurisprudence W M Lile UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 3 113

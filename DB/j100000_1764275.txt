In the first there is a constant flitting of the mind from one idea to another a constant dissipation of the energies in all directions for which the word distraction may be retained and there is the lack of attention to the impressions going on about us due to the fact that the at tention is really absorbed in something else  this is absentmind edness which is thus an extreme  presentmindedness  to a different train of thought and may be termed  abstraction It is with the exaggeration of one or other of these two conditions that morbid states of the attention are allied If we take as a convenient defini tion of normal attention  a temporary predominance of a mental state with a natural or artificial adaptation of the subject then we can distinguish two groups of morbid deviations I an absolute predominance of such a state that becomes fixed and cannot be dislodged from consciousness and 2 a state in which no idea can get an audience and the attention is too weak to hold an im pression steadily in the mind To this may be added a third group in which through congenital defect the power of attention never develops as in idiots and the weakminded There are all degrees of transition from a normal concentration of the attention to the most imperative forms of fixed ideas We have all been haunted by an aria which we cannot stop humming have been anxious about a sick friend so that in spite of ourselves we could think of nothing else This is a mild form of possession by an idea that is more persistent than any other keeps itself in consciousness and by imperceptible steps passes beyond the con trol of the will The profound absorptions of many great men in their work are so much beyond their own control that one cannot but recognize an element of the morbid in them When the object of reflection is a less worthy one and the devotion to it far from coinciding with the intentions of the individual seems to him as an imposed task we speak of an insistent idea zwangsvorstellung of the Germans M Ribot distinguishes three kinds of such accord 1 Abstract of an article by Th Ribot Revue Philoso5khique February 1888 See Science Dec 2 and I6 1887 VOL XI No 267 ing as the purely intellectual the emotional usually a fear as the long list of phobias indicates or the voluntary usually a morbid impulse to an absurd or criminal act kleptomania etc predomi nates The first class is the most important in this connection The insistent idea takes many shapes and in most of these we can trace analogies to our own everyday experiences There is an arithmetical form of it that sets the patient to ask Why are men just so and so high Why have houses this particular height  and so on Again it may be a mania for counting every thing the number of pavements on a street the number of streets in a city The sight of a bag of grain irresistibly led one patient to estimate how many grains there are in the bag how many in the country etc Another must count all the trains leaving the rail roadstation and keep account of their destinations In these cases the patients often recognize the morbid nature of their thoughts they fight against them know that they are wasting time but the ideas fill their minds completely and demand atten tion with a tyrants power A feeling of intense discomfort of an impending evil if they fail to count the trains etc is sometimes associated with the state There is too a metaphysical mania in which the mind busies itself with unanswerable questions as to the constitution of matter the final ends of nature and so on Persons thus affected are usually of more than average culture for the concentration of attention implies mental power Nor are the objects of their thoughts entirely different from ours the main difference is in the time and the control of these states We think of such problems for a while and then pass on to something else to them that is impossible In other respects such patients are often perfectly sound and show great ingenuity in concealing a knowledge of their weakness from their associates In general it can be said that a large proportion of persons thus afflicted are the offspring of neuropathic parents and not infrequently show other and physical symptoms of a degenerate stock But the environ ment edlucation must be called into account to explain others of them  and each case especially as regards the particular form that the idea takes must be studied by itself The state differs from the normal then in degree rather than in kind It is persistent it is intense it allows no relapse to a diffuse condition of the at tention and as a mark of nervous disorder it carries with it a weakness of the will that cannot drive out the unwelcome and offi cious visitor A more intense and acute concentration of the attention is to be found in the trance state or ecstasy This is allied to contempla tion to absorption in intellectual work and brings with it an in sensibility to outward impressions When the state is very pro found such impressions can be intense and yet pass unnoticed Archimedes during the taking of Syracuse remains absorbed in his contemplations Soldiers often do not know they are wounded until the fight is over Here again there is a high degree of men tal power necessary though it is often exhibited by fanatics other wise mentally inert But M Ribot properly distinguishes between the cases in which the object of the contemplation is a sensory one and those in which it is purely ideal and adds that the fanatics usually display the former kind of extreme attention As a type of the more spiritual kind of ecstasy the remarkable confessions of St Theresa a Spanish religionist of the sixteenth century is cited She describes no less than seven stages of ecstasy which are in a rough way capable of a psychological interpretation The first is a state of  vocal prayer  that is the praying in a loud voice draws the attention away from the outside world The second stage is termed  mental prayer The sensory impressions are no longer necessary the mind being held by the ideas that fill it The  prayer of meditation  marks the third stage which is perhaps only a more intense form of the previous state The fourth degree is charac terized by the  prayer of passivity Here the soul no longer pro duces but receives has truth directly impressed upon it without the need of a logical demonstration The fifth stage the  prayer of union marks the beginning of the ecstasy but it is as yet an in stable state and the possession is not profound Finally in the sixth stage the prayer of rapture the body becomes cold speech and respiration are checked the eyes are closed the slightest movements require great effort and in rare cases consciousness is lost The seventh degree of ecstasy is very mystically describedSCIENCE but is only an accentuation of the sixth with perhaps a deeper loss of consciousness Here the mind is reduced to a single point at tention is sharpened to the finest focus and this extreme contem plation seems to be an exception to the dictum of Hobbes that to constantly think the same thing is not to think at all Such extreme ecstasy is a rare phenomenon Plotinus is said to have attained it only four times and Porphyry but once The weakening of the attention is seen in an extreme form in mania which presents a general and permanent exalted excitability of the psychic life The general diffusion of energy is equally ap parent in the prodigality of movements with often an insensibility to fatigue No coordination of the mental energy requiring an effort of the attention is possible The same is seen in hysteria in sleepy conditions in drunkenness in children These semimorbid states well illustrate the motor element in attention The power of directing the delicate movements that accompany attention is lack ing and with this the attention itself is weakened One sees in the effects of intoxication the loss of power over the finer muscles then over the coarser ones both accompanied by an impossibility to at tend to thoughtful ideas and then to mental impressions of the simplest kind In sleep there is to a slight degree a direction of the attention for the sleeper is more easily aroused by one kind of stimulus than by another but in general the power of attention is nearly lost If we pass from the cases in which the power of at tention has been lost by disease to those in which it was never developed we have a difference of degree alone Idiots again are found incapable of directing their finer muscles and in ex treme cases cannot walk and the most successful mode of ap proach to the minds of such defectives has been found to be through the muscles By way of rdsuime we may speak of attention as a prevalent at titude of mind It may be represented by a straight line bifurcat ing at either end In the centre we have the average spontaneous attention as we proceed to the right the attention increases in intensity passing into strong spontaneous attention then into pre occupation revery then into a weak insistent idea Here the line divides passing into the two extremes  a fixed idea on the one side and ecstasy on the other Beginning again with the normal and going to the left we have voluntary attention as an organic mental habit and as this decreases it is of only average power then it becomes weak and finally passes into the extreme loss of attention which may be temporary and acquired on the one hand or permanent and congenital on the other These are simply various types in reality all kinds of intermediate forms abound UNCONSCIOUS CEREBRATION In the Poy5idar Science Monthly for March Mr Francis Speir analyzes the returns to a list of questions quite extensively circulated by him relating to the uncon scious activity of the mind The questions ask for instance of the power of recalling a forgotten word or senseimpression while thinking of something else or perhaps in sleep of the power of going through a more or less simple logical process under similar conditions and of the workingout of original ideas composition of verses solution of a problem new modes of regarding a series of facts and the like especially of feats of this kind performed during sleep The answers unmistakably show that the uncon scious learns many an art from our conscious selves without the teacher knowing it and the relative frequency of really respectable performances going on in sleep is larger than one would a priori expect

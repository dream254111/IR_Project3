political and social equality M Bougl6 finds one influential source of these ideas in the growth of large states By large states he understands not merely states with immense territory but with a great density of population and above all with a great mobility and interchange of commerce and ideas between different parts of the population In the large social group the individual sees a constantly changing mass of humanity a fact which gives rise to the formation of broad universal and even humanitarian ideas Again the lack of familiarity with many of his fellowcitizens comes to inspire a general respect for strangers which is finally extended to all whether they are of the same nation as himself or not Meeting or seeing so many different people must also ne cessarily diminish the respect for privileged persons in the course of time thinks the author This does not necessarily involve the establishment of a democratic government by any means since the idea of equality prevails among the governed only with respect to each other not with reference to their rulers The author traces the growth of ideas of equality from their earliest form viz equality between those of the same blood to the equality of those living in the same territory and finally the legal equality of all irrespective of kin or territory The reasoning would have been much more forcible had the author given a more careful analysis of the influence of commerce and transportation upon equality As a consequence of this fault the work seems to exaggerate the influence of the size of political units upon political ideas When the author comes to explain those large states in which the idea of equality has not made much head way and those small states in which equality does prevail he is obliged to rely upon the density of the population and where this explanation fails he falls back upon mobility of the people and the influence of the city upon politics These latter then are the really important factors of the problem and a more careful study along these lines would add considerable value to the work 1 By C BOUGLk Pp 249 Price 375 fr Paris F Alcan 1899 120NoTEs 121 IN

The author discusses the charac ter of the natives of the colonists the general organization of the administration the system of education and the weaknesses of the Dutch colonial government He summarizes the reforms desired as follows I Less power to be given to the regents 2 Education of the native aristocracy 3 Checks upon the possible tyranny of the aristocracy 4 Greater harmony between the European officials and the natives 5 Better education of the European officials 6 The revival of a system of protectorate and administrative decen tralization EvoLUrIoN MEANS change and that may

French work  Evolution by Atrophy in Biology and Sociology 2 Without discussing the mooted question of the validity of biological analogies in sociology the authors three professors in Brussels working independently in their respective fields believe that there are com mon characters as well as distinctive ones in the comparison of organs and organisms with social institutions and human societies A com parison of these independent studies of atrophied parts in plant and animal organisms and in social life presents strikingly similar con clusions Such a study adds many interesting

other Such work com mends itself to good judgment more than most of the results of socalled biological sociology The chief conclusions are that retrogression is a universal and necessary complement to progress that it follows no definite path and most certainly does not retrace the steps of progressive evolution and that especially in the department of social life its main cause is artificial selection Other causes of retrogression are found in inutility of function insufficiency of nutriment or resource and in biology only lack of space NAPOLEONS WAR MAXIMS 1 is a collection of the most noted mil itary principles which have been credited to Napoleon The maxims are discussed very briefly by the editor who cites numerous illustra tions of their application in actual warfare The work also contains a compilation of Napoleons social and political thoughts which are far below the military maxims in their general value Among the most interesting of the political maxims are the following  There should be no half responsibility of the administration It will only cause peculation and the nonperformance of the laws  Anarchy is the steppingstone to absolute power A state without an aristocracy is a vessel without a rudder a balloon in the air  Commerce unites men and makes them therefore it is fatal to despotic power  Finances founded on good agricultural prospects will never be destroyed  Governments with balanced force are of no value but in times of peace JOHN RUSKIN SOCIAL REFPORMER by J A Hobson is an at tempt to arrange Ruskins social philosophy in a logical and orderly discourse something of which Ruskin himself had no conception whatever The claim is made that Ruskin is primarily and funda mentally in all his work as artcritic and man of letters a political economist and that he has succeeded in placing political economy upon a sounder scientific and ethical foundation than it had hitherto possessed Such is the novel and interesting task that the author sets himself Though an economist of some merit himself and an ardent 1L E HENRY B A M R C P Pp xxiv 187 Price 6 s London Gale  Polden Ltd 1899 2 Pp ix 357 Price 15o Boston  Dana Estes  Co 1898NOTES 123 admirer of Ruskin it is safe to predict that the general verdict will be that Mr Hobson has failed of his purpose largely through no fault of his own but because of the impossibility of his task Those who love to read Ruskin for his brilliancy of style and vigorous rhetoric and for the general inspiration that comes from a most original and suggestive thinker who was too erratic and misinformed to be a sys tem maker will not relish Mr Hobsons dry pages while economists will be more amused than convinced by his attempts to fill out the lacunae in Ruskins economic reasoning The biographical chapter is much less interesting and instructive than an equal portion of Col lingwoods  Life and Work of John Ruskin One might also criti cise in the remaining chapters the failure to interpret Ruskins peculiar personality in terms of his surroundings and of the influence of his time1 THE LAW OF ELECTRIC WIRES IN STRIEETS AND HIGHWAYS contains in chapters III and IV an admirable summary of the Ameri can law governing the regulation by municipalities of electric light motor telegraph and telephone wires The extended discussion and litigation over franchises in recent years having attracted considerable attention the author devotes a special chapter to judicial decisions on the grant of franchises for these important purposes A REVISED EDITION of Judge Landons Constitutional History of the United States  has recently appeared The original edition of this work published more than a decade since has been constantly gain ing in public favor owing partly to the fact that it is the only con stitutional history of the United States in one volume and to its clear and succinct presentation of the leading facts in the development of our complex constitutional system In the new edition the work has been rewritten in part and considerably enlarged The first two chapters of the orjginal edition dealing with the colonial and revolu tionary periods have been expanded into four and two chapters instead of one are devoted to the  Critical Period  of the Confedera tion and Constitutional Convention Although the body of the work dealing with our history under

illustrative footnote or a supple mentary paragraph as is notably the case in connection with the his tory of the events growing out of the recent Spanish war An additional chapter has been added to the admirable treatment of the judicial system contained in the original edition In fact the most valuable feature of the work to the general reader is the excellent presentation of the position and influence of the Federal judiciary in our system This position is set forth in a scholarly and discrimi nating review of the great constitutional decisions of the Supreme Court from the earliest cases down to the most recent with special emphasis on those relating to corporate combinations and territorial expansion In treating the constitutional issues arising from our most recent acquisitions the author reaches the conclusion that the Federal Government may exercise in our new possessions the com bined powers of a general and of a state government but if the people of these islands become subject to the sovereignty of the United States it will not be the unlimited sovereignty as exercised in its foreign relations for the people subject to its sovereignty cannot be foreign to it but they will be subject to its limited sovereignty as the constitution confers it over the people under its jurisdiction The two concluding chapters of the original edition have been recast in the new They contain a philosophic discussion of some of the reasons for the stability and success of our dual system of government and point out some of the dangers of the future and their remedies All of the changes noted enhance the value of an already useful work LA RENOVATION DE IASia1 is an interesting discussion of the more recent phases of the Asiatic question with special reference to the de velopment of Siberia by Russia the progress of Western ideas and reforms in Japan and the questions arising from the reform move ment in China The author is of the opinion that progress must move very slowly in the latter country if it is desired to avoid the de struction of the empire He discusses the weakness of the Pekin government the reform movement under the leadership of Kang YouWei the influence of the Dowager Empress the palace revolu tion of 1898 and the possibilities of an eventual partition of China It is interesting to note that the author classes Germany Russia and France together as hostile to the opendoor policy Great Britain the United States and Japan as partisans of that policy The author con cludes in favor of the preservation of the existing government rather 1

Chinese A NEW EDITION of Plehns Introduction to Public Finance I testifies to the popularity of that work as a college text Except for the addi tion of an important chapter on the  Financial Administration of War Illustrated by the Experience of the United States in the War with Spain the new edition is so like a reprint of the old that refer ence to it as  revised  as well as  enlarged  seems scarcely justified Adams Finance is still spoken of as  announced and the account of the tariff policy of the United States still concludes with a descrip tion of the  recent reforms  of the Wilson act and without any reference to subsequent legislation These minor points however detract but little from the value of the work and the full account of the fihiancial operations connected with our late war in the chapter referred to brings it down to date in all essential respects The chief merits of this as of the earlier edition are its interesting presentations of the facts connected with the financial policies of the United States the United Kingdom Germany and France and its temperate discus sion of principles In using it no teacher will be under the necessity of antagonizing and therefore to some extent discrediting the author as is too frequently the case with textbooks on political economy WORLD POLITICS AS INFILUENCED BY THE ORIENTAL SITUATION2 makes its appearance at a most opportune moment The author con siders the Chinese question to be the centre of interest in international politics he therefore groups all his material around this central point In Part I the growth of the idea of national imperialism is sketched and Machiavellis place as the philosopher of nationalism is discussed An interesting though brief comparison of the ancient and modern systems of world politics the worldembiacing empire and the  inter national equilibrium  is also noteworthy In this first part the author also calls attention to the rapidly increasing importance of modern transportation systems in determining the political solidarity of colonial empires After some discussion of the reasons for the success or failure of the different colonizing powers of Europe Part I concludes with a consideration of the connection between colonization and imperialism and the consequences of the imperial istic policy Briefly stated the author finds the consequences to be the

social doctrines of liberalism the increase of oneman power and an accompanying development of aristocratic ideas in the philosophy of the time In Part II the author attacks the real subject of his work The Opening of China He states as the general conclusion of those familiar with Chinese affairs that  the coal and mineral wealth of China taken in connection with the vast and highly trained frugal and capable population will during the coming century make China the industrial centre of the world and the Pacific the chief theatre of commerce After a more or less detailed study of the  conces sions  and  spheres  acquired by foreign countries in China Part II concludes with a summary of the existing internal conditions and a prophecy as to the impending industrial revolution in China Parts III and IV contain an interesting and suggestive discussion of the influence of the Chinese situation upon the policy of Russia and other European countries Professor Reinsch traces three stages of Russian expansion having for their objective points Constantinople Afghan istan and China the Russian system of expansion furthermore differs from the English in that England merely superimposes her civilization upon the native races while Russia assimilates them bodily The author believes that it will be impossible to impose Western civilization upon the Chinese because of their great powers of resist ance but he thinks that they will gladly adopt practical Western methods unless native hostility is aroused by forcible interference with timehonored customs and traditions Unfortunately since the work was written this possibility has been fully realized and the na tional hatred for foreigners has blazed up in such a way as to prevent the slow peaceful spread of Western ideas which otherwise might have occurred Part V sketches very briefly the position of the United States in the East The author believes that we should refrain from any further territorial acquisitions because of the more profitable opportunity for the development of our resources at home He con cludes with some interesting observations on the increase in the power of the Executive caused by a colonial or imperialistic policy The general style and arrangement of the work are popular and in places a trifle sketchy but the timeliness of the book atones for much that might otherwise be criticized THE RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STATISTICS the first regu lar number of which appears in September of the present year is I Edited by CHARLES GOODLET Published quarterly by G Barbet de Vaux Milionaia 23 St PetersburgNoTES 127 intended to supply much needed information upon the financial administrative and internal economic conditions of Russia for the bene fit of English and American readers Such a publication is assured a hearty welcome from economists and publicists who have felt the lack of reliable data upon Russian conditions Doubtless the Russians themselves have felt the need of a more adequate representation of their interests among the periodical publications of the day than they have hitherto possessed the specimen numbers which have been dis tributed are semiofficial in tone and very creditable in appearance and general composition PROFESSOR BENJAMIN F SHAMBAUGH1 has collected the more important newspaper articles and comments upon the Constitutional Conventions of 1844 and 1846 in Iowa and has attempted to give some description of the proceedings of the conventions from these sources The result is a very interesting compilation which will be of great assistance to those engaged in the study of state constitutions The notes are edited in such a way as to bring out the salient points of the constitution There are appendices containing valuable data relative to the members of the convention giving their native states ages occupations and the number of years of residence in Iowa In the absence of complete records of the conventions proceedings Professor Shambaughs compilation will be very useful WITH THE periodical recurrence of socialistic agitation one is ever reminded of the confusion in the average mind in the use of the terms socialist and anarchist Mr E V Zenker in his  Anarchism A Criticism and History of the Anarchist Theory I has given us the first complete statement in the English language of the theories of the leading anarchists It is a most readable discussion of the social question by one who while opposed to the theories of the anarchists nevertheless makes every effort to state their position fairly and sym pathetically because he is interested above all things in interpreting accurately the thoughts and ambitions of the common people Most of the material relating to Proudhon including copious extracts from his works should interest a wide range of English readers in a writer of great power who was little understood outside his own country The chapter on Stirner is for the most part new ground The Rus sian doctrine and Prince Kropotkin are better known There is 1 Fragments of the Debates of the Iowa Constitutional Conventions of x844 and 7846 Compiled and edited by

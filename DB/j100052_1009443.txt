J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009443,NOTES,I242535,BOOK DEPARTMENT NOTES  LES IDIE 1 EGALITAIRES  IS A DISCUSSION OF THE ORIGIN OF THE IDEA OR IDEAS OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL EQUALITY M BOUGL6 FINDS ONE INFLUENTIAL SOURCE OF THESE IDEAS IN THE GROWTH OF LARGE STATES BY LARGE STATES HE UNDERSTANDS NOT MERELY STATES WITH IMMENSE TERRITORY BUT WITH A GREAT DENSITY OF POPULATION AND ABOVE ALL WITH A GREAT MOBILITY AND INTERCHANGE OF COMMERCE AND IDEAS BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE POPULATION IN THE LARGE SOCIAL GROUP THE INDIVIDUAL SEES A CONSTANTLY CHANGING MASS OF HUMANITY A FACT WHICH GIVES RISE TO THE FORMATION OF BROAD UNIVERSAL AND EVEN HUMANITARIAN IDEAS AGAIN THE LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH MANY OF HIS FELLOWCITIZENS COMES TO INSPIRE A GENERAL RESPECT FOR STRANGERS WHICH IS FINALLY EXTENDED TO ALL WHETHER THEY ARE OF THE SAME NATION AS HIMSELF OR NOT MEETING OR SEEING SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE MUST ALSO NE CESSARILY DIMINISH THE RESPECT FOR PRIVILEGED PERSONS IN THE COURSE OF TIME THINKS THE AUTHOR THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BY ANY MEANS SINCE THE IDEA OF EQUALITY PREVAILS AMONG THE GOVERNED ONLY WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER NOT WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR RULERS THE AUTHOR TRACES THE GROWTH OF IDEAS OF EQUALITY FROM THEIR EARLIEST FORM VIZ EQUALITY BETWEEN THOSE OF THE SAME BLOOD TO THE EQUALITY OF THOSE LIVING IN THE SAME TERRITORY AND FINALLY THE LEGAL EQUALITY OF ALL IRRESPECTIVE OF KIN OR TERRITORY THE REASONING WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE FORCIBLE HAD THE AUTHOR GIVEN A MORE CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF COMMERCE AND TRANSPORTATION UPON EQUALITY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FAULT THE WORK SEEMS TO EXAGGERATE THE INFLUENCE OF THE SIZE OF POLITICAL UNITS UPON POLITICAL IDEAS WHEN THE AUTHOR COMES TO EXPLAIN THOSE LARGE STATES IN WHICH THE IDEA OF EQUALITY HAS NOT MADE MUCH HEAD WAY AND THOSE SMALL STATES IN WHICH EQUALITY DOES PREVAIL HE IS OBLIGED TO RELY UPON THE DENSITY OF THE POPULATION AND WHERE THIS EXPLANATION FAILS HE FALLS BACK UPON MOBILITY OF THE PEOPLE AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE CITY UPON POLITICS THESE LATTER THEN ARE THE REALLY IMPORTANT FACTORS OF THE PROBLEM AND A MORE CAREFUL STUDY ALONG THESE LINES WOULD ADD CONSIDERABLE VALUE TO THE WORK 1 BY C BOUGLK PP 249 PRICE 375 FR PARIS F ALCAN 1899 120NOTES 121 IN

OTHER SUCH WORK COM MENDS ITSELF TO GOOD JUDGMENT MORE THAN MOST OF THE RESULTS OF SOCALLED BIOLOGICAL SOCIOLOGY THE CHIEF CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT RETROGRESSION IS A UNIVERSAL AND NECESSARY COMPLEMENT TO PROGRESS THAT IT FOLLOWS NO DEFINITE PATH AND MOST CERTAINLY DOES NOT RETRACE THE STEPS OF PROGRESSIVE EVOLUTION AND THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL LIFE ITS MAIN CAUSE IS ARTIFICIAL SELECTION OTHER CAUSES OF RETROGRESSION ARE FOUND IN INUTILITY OF FUNCTION INSUFFICIENCY OF NUTRIMENT OR RESOURCE AND IN BIOLOGY ONLY LACK OF SPACE NAPOLEONS WAR MAXIMS 1 IS A COLLECTION OF THE MOST NOTED MIL ITARY PRINCIPLES WHICH HAVE BEEN CREDITED TO NAPOLEON THE MAXIMS ARE DISCUSSED VERY BRIEFLY BY THE EDITOR WHO CITES NUMEROUS ILLUSTRA TIONS OF THEIR APPLICATION IN ACTUAL WARFARE THE WORK ALSO CONTAINS A COMPILATION OF NAPOLEONS SOCIAL AND POLITICAL THOUGHTS WHICH ARE FAR BELOW THE MILITARY MAXIMS IN THEIR GENERAL VALUE AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING OF THE POLITICAL MAXIMS ARE THE FOLLOWING  THERE SHOULD BE NO HALF RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION IT WILL ONLY CAUSE PECULATION AND THE NONPERFORMANCE OF THE LAWS  ANARCHY IS THE STEPPINGSTONE TO ABSOLUTE POWER A STATE WITHOUT AN ARISTOCRACY IS A VESSEL WITHOUT A RUDDER A BALLOON IN THE AIR  COMMERCE UNITES MEN AND MAKES THEM THEREFORE IT IS FATAL TO DESPOTIC POWER  FINANCES FOUNDED ON GOOD AGRICULTURAL PROSPECTS WILL NEVER BE DESTROYED  GOVERNMENTS WITH BALANCED FORCE ARE OF NO VALUE BUT IN TIMES OF PEACE JOHN RUSKIN SOCIAL REFPORMER BY J A HOBSON IS AN AT TEMPT TO ARRANGE RUSKINS SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY IN A LOGICAL AND ORDERLY DISCOURSE SOMETHING OF WHICH RUSKIN HIMSELF HAD NO CONCEPTION WHATEVER THE CLAIM IS MADE THAT RUSKIN IS PRIMARILY AND FUNDA MENTALLY IN ALL HIS WORK AS ARTCRITIC AND MAN OF LETTERS A POLITICAL ECONOMIST AND THAT HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN PLACING POLITICAL ECONOMY UPON A SOUNDER SCIENTIFIC AND ETHICAL FOUNDATION THAN IT HAD HITHERTO POSSESSED SUCH IS THE NOVEL AND INTERESTING TASK THAT THE AUTHOR

123 ADMIRER OF RUSKIN IT IS SAFE TO PREDICT THAT THE GENERAL VERDICT WILL BE THAT MR HOBSON HAS FAILED OF HIS PURPOSE LARGELY THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN BUT BECAUSE OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HIS TASK THOSE WHO LOVE TO READ RUSKIN FOR HIS BRILLIANCY OF STYLE AND VIGOROUS RHETORIC AND FOR THE GENERAL INSPIRATION THAT COMES FROM A MOST ORIGINAL AND SUGGESTIVE THINKER WHO WAS TOO ERRATIC AND MISINFORMED TO BE A SYS TEM MAKER WILL NOT RELISH MR HOBSONS DRY PAGES WHILE ECONOMISTS WILL BE MORE AMUSED THAN CONVINCED BY HIS ATTEMPTS TO FILL OUT THE LACUNAE IN RUSKINS ECONOMIC REASONING THE BIOGRAPHICAL CHAPTER IS MUCH LESS INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE THAN AN EQUAL PORTION OF COL LINGWOODS  LIFE AND WORK OF JOHN RUSKIN ONE MIGHT ALSO CRITI CISE IN THE REMAINING CHAPTERS THE FAILURE TO INTERPRET RUSKINS PECULIAR PERSONALITY IN TERMS OF HIS SURROUNDINGS AND OF THE INFLUENCE OF HIS TIME1 THE LAW OF ELECTRIC WIRES IN STRIEETS AND HIGHWAYS CONTAINS IN CHAPTERS III AND IV AN ADMIRABLE

THE ADMIRABLE TREATMENT OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL EDITION IN FACT THE MOST VALUABLE FEATURE OF THE WORK TO THE GENERAL READER IS THE EXCELLENT PRESENTATION OF THE POSITION AND INFLUENCE OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY IN OUR SYSTEM THIS POSITION IS SET FORTH IN A SCHOLARLY AND DISCRIMI NATING REVIEW OF THE GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT FROM THE EARLIEST CASES DOWN TO THE MOST RECENT WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THOSE RELATING TO CORPORATE COMBINATIONS AND TERRITORIAL EXPANSION IN TREATING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES ARISING FROM OUR MOST RECENT ACQUISITIONS THE AUTHOR REACHES THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY EXERCISE IN OUR NEW POSSESSIONS THE COM BINED POWERS OF A GENERAL AND OF A STATE GOVERNMENT BUT IF THE PEOPLE OF THESE ISLANDS BECOME SUBJECT TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED STATES IT WILL NOT BE THE UNLIMITED SOVEREIGNTY AS EXERCISED IN ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS FOR THE PEOPLE SUBJECT TO ITS SOVEREIGNTY CANNOT BE FOREIGN TO IT BUT THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO ITS LIMITED SOVEREIGNTY AS THE CONSTITUTION CONFERS IT OVER THE PEOPLE UNDER ITS JURISDICTION THE TWO CONCLUDING CHAPTERS OF THE ORIGINAL EDITION HAVE BEEN RECAST IN THE NEW THEY CONTAIN A PHILOSOPHIC DISCUSSION OF SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THE STABILITY AND SUCCESS OF OUR DUAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND POINT OUT SOME OF THE DANGERS OF THE FUTURE AND THEIR REMEDIES ALL OF THE CHANGES NOTED ENHANCE THE VALUE OF AN ALREADY USEFUL WORK LA RENOVATION DE IASIA1 IS AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION OF THE MORE RECENT PHASES OF THE ASIATIC QUESTION WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE DE VELOPMENT OF SIBERIA BY RUSSIA THE PROGRESS OF WESTERN IDEAS AND REFORMS IN JAPAN AND THE QUESTIONS ARISING FROM THE REFORM MOVE MENT IN CHINA THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT PROGRESS MUST MOVE VERY

INFLUENCE OF THE DOWAGER EMPRESS THE PALACE REVOLU TION OF 1898 AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF AN EVENTUAL PARTITION OF CHINA IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE AUTHOR CLASSES GERMANY RUSSIA AND FRANCE

OUR LATE WAR IN THE CHAPTER REFERRED TO BRINGS IT DOWN TO DATE IN ALL ESSENTIAL RESPECTS THE CHIEF MERITS OF THIS AS OF THE EARLIER EDITION ARE ITS INTERESTING PRESENTATIONS OF THE FACTS CONNECTED

WORK THE OPENING OF CHINA HE STATES AS THE GENERAL CONCLUSION OF THOSE FAMILIAR WITH CHINESE AFFAIRS THAT  THE COAL AND MINERAL WEALTH OF CHINA TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE VAST AND HIGHLY TRAINED

CHINA PARTS III AND IV CONTAIN AN INTERESTING AND SUGGESTIVE DISCUSSION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHINESE SITUATION UPON THE POLICY OF RUSSIA AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PROFESSOR REINSCH TRACES THREE STAGES OF RUSSIAN EXPANSION HAVING FOR THEIR OBJECTIVE POINTS CONSTANTINOPLE AFGHAN ISTAN AND CHINA THE RUSSIAN SYSTEM OF EXPANSION FURTHERMORE DIFFERS FROM THE ENGLISH IN THAT ENGLAND MERELY SUPERIMPOSES HER CIVILIZATION UPON THE NATIVE RACES WHILE RUSSIA ASSIMILATES THEM BODILY THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPOSE WESTERN CIVILIZATION UPON THE CHINESE BECAUSE OF THEIR GREAT POWERS OF RESIST ANCE BUT HE THINKS THAT THEY WILL GLADLY ADOPT PRACTICAL WESTERN METHODS UNLESS NATIVE HOSTILITY IS AROUSED BY FORCIBLE INTERFERENCE WITH TIMEHONORED CUSTOMS AND TRADITIONS UNFORTUNATELY SINCE THE WORK WAS WRITTEN THIS POSSIBILITY HAS BEEN FULLY REALIZED AND THE NA TIONAL HATRED FOR FOREIGNERS HAS BLAZED UP IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PREVENT THE SLOW PEACEFUL SPREAD OF WESTERN IDEAS WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED PART V SKETCHES VERY BRIEFLY THE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE EAST THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD REFRAIN FROM ANY FURTHER TERRITORIAL ACQUISITIONS BECAUSE OF THE MORE PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RESOURCES AT HOME HE CON CLUDES WITH SOME INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS ON THE INCREASE IN THE POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE CAUSED BY A COLONIAL OR IMPERIALISTIC POLICY THE GENERAL STYLE AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE WORK ARE POPULAR AND IN PLACES A TRIFLE SKETCHY BUT THE TIMELINESS OF THE BOOK ATONES FOR MUCH THAT MIGHT

Cincinnati Chicago and St Louis Railway Company Indianapolis Ind The inability of many of the railroads of the country or portions of numerous other railroad systems to handle prompntly the freight offered for transportation has increased the importance of devising some method of adding to the efficiency of the enormous freight car equipment now in use upon American railways There is no topic in railway management more discussed than the car shortage or car surplus question This is a comparatively recent problem that has arisen as the result primarily of the enormous increase in traffic during the past seven years and secondarily of the steady development of through shipments or longdistance traffic The development of the country the widely distributed population and industry and the growing unification of the transportation business of the country as a whole are causing the former method of interchanging cars to become antiquated and practically unworkable Prior to 1872 connecting railway companies did not exchange freight cars regularly except in the case of cars that were assigned to freight lines and which were marked and known as line cars The payment for the use of cars that were interchanged was made by junction agents at the rate of two cents per loaded mile run In 1872 this charge was reduced to one cent per mile run loaded or empty settlement being made by the accounting department of the company borrowing the car by a report made to the corresponding department of the company owning the car In August 1876 the payment per mile run was reduced to threequarters of a cent and later a further reduction to threefifths of a cent was made the charge in each case being for the entire distance traveled by the car whether loaded or empty This system of payment upon the basis of mileage proved fairly satisfactory during the prosperous years preceding 1893 Then 260Pooling of Freight Cars 17 when the panic came which was followed by a period of five years of business depression the railroads of the country were troubled with a surplus rather than with a shortage of equipment Many roads were glad to have their equipment used by other companies During the period from 1893 to 1899 there was cdmparatively little increase in the freight car equipment and the consequence was that when business became active just before 1900 every railroad soon began to clamor for cars The situation which began to develop in 89919oo00 has grown steadily more acute year by year until at the present time every railroad company is obliged to confess itself unable to supply the shippers promptly and adequately with a suffi cient number of cars Various efforts have been made to deal with this steadily in creasing difficulty and perplexity As a result of an agitation in 19o0 the railroads of the United States on the Ist of July 1902 changed the basis of settlement for the use of foreign cars from miles run to a per diem basis The payment agreed upon was twenty cents per day the owner of the car having the right to demand its return when the car had been absent from its lines twenty days If the car was not returned within ten days thereafter viz thirty days from the time it left the line of the owning company the per diem charge was advanced from twenty cents to one dollar It was hoped that this change in the payment for the use of foreign cars would solve the question It did indeed prove to be much superior to the mileage basis of payment and experience has shown that time is a better standard than mileage in fixing the charges for the rental of cars A fundamental defect in the per diem penalty plan of charging for the use of foreign cars is becoming evident it has had the effect of pooling cars moving in the direction of roads receiving large volumes of inbound business and of taking equipment away from the lines of roads having a large outbound traffic Thus for in stance road A might deliver Iooo cars to road B in a month while during the same time road B would have only 6oo carloads of freight for delivery to A If under these conditions B had an unusual demand for cars it would retain the 400 cars thus received in excess of those given it and use the same to carry on its business with other companies viz to supply its own equipment needs The method of paying for the use of foreign cars does not insure a 261I8 The Annals of the American Academy prompt return to road A of the equipment sent out by it in excess of the equipment received in the transportation of traffic coming to it from connecting lines Railroad companies that are large orig inators of traffic are easily denuded of equipment and are without the power under the present rules to get their cars back within a reasonable time As the demand for cars has increased as storage facilities have become inadequate with the growth of traffic and as the average number of miles which a carload of freight is moved has grown greatly the per diem of twenty cents has come to be entirely inadequate This fact was so clearly recognized by railroads that on the Ist of January 19o6 the per diem was raised to twentyfive cents per car with a per diem penalty of seventyfive cents additional at the end of thirty days This increase was soon shown to be insuffi cient and the result was that in the autumn of 19o6 a number of railroads agreed among themselves to charge each other tempo rarily a per diem of fifty cents without the penalty feature The roads which did not become parties to this agreement have con tinued to charge the old rates of twentyfive cents per day increasing to one dollar per day to the end of thirty days Even the per diem charge of fifty cents has not met the situa tion There is still a severe car shortage and it will be impossible for the railroads to secure from the car builders a sufficient number of cars during the present calendar year to relieve the situation At the close of January 1907 a number of railroads agreed to enter a freight car pool provided a satisfactory plan for regulating such a pool could be worked out Thus far no practical plan has yet been presented Everybody seems to recognize that the per diem system of payment ought to be changed but the problem of working out a car pooling arrangement that is satisfactory to all parties in interest has thus far proven impossible of solution One thing however is certain the rules that have been recom mended providing for the return of cars as per marks or ownership are impracticable for the reasons that every restriction placed upon the fnovement of a car reduces its availability increases the mileage which it travels without a load and adds to the time and expense required for switching Someplan must be found for controlling the movement of freight cars before traffic officials can hope to discover a practical solution of the problem 262Pooling of Freight Cars 19 In order to deal adequately with the distribution and move ment of cars a system must be established that will be in accordance with the following principles I Equity must be secured alike to owner and user of the car viz to both delivering and receiving lines 2 The payment must reward the efficient use of equipment and adequately penalize its inefficient use 3 The reward should be in proportion to the degree of merit and the penalty should correspond with the degree of the offense 4 The system of control should minimize operating expenses as far as possible and should provide definitely for settlements day by day or week by week between the delivering and receiving lines 5 No unadjusted discrepancies between car owner and user should be permitted 6 The system should insure to each road the full use of its own equipment or of cars providing an equivalent equipment 7 The system should provide for maximum loads and should minimize as far as possible the emptyhaul mileage In the opinion of the writer these principles of car control and distribution can be carried out in practice only by a system of pool ing freight cars in accordance with an equitable arrangement that will prevent the appropriation by any one or more lines of the larger and better cars and that will provide for a daily settlement between delivering and receiving lines This system would minimize the expenses of operation and maximize the efficiency of the equipment As the result of a careful study of the subject and of business experi ence the author recommends the following plan for the organization and management of a freight car pool He believes that it solves every element of the problem and that its adoption by the railroads generally in the United States would enormously increase the effi ciency of their freight equipment SUGGESTED PLAN I An inventory to be taken of every car on each line home and foreign at 12or a m date of beginning of plan 2 A statement of equipment owned at 12or a m date of operation 3 The difference between ownership and actual cars on hand to consti tute a debit or credit as the case may be 4 Each day at 1201 a m a report to be rendered in triplicate by each agent of cars delivered to connecting lines to the agent of such line for the 26320 The Annals of the American Academy twentyfour hours preceding such reports to be checked and verified by both agents or preferably by a joint clerk one copy to be kept by the receiv ing agent two copies to be returned to the delivering agent one for his file and one to be forwarded with notations thereon to the district man ager of the pool The receiving agent to be required to take an impression copy and send the original to his car accountant 5 In case of omissions errors or discrepancy in statements such dis crepancies to be adjusted within twentyfour hours the delivering line in the meantime assuming the expense of car hire until it proves delivery if not adjusted in ninetysix hours then the inspector of the pool to investigate and his report must be accepted by both lines subject to appeal to the dis trict manager In all cases of dispute when finally decided all errors and omissions to be adjusted on current interchange report which report shall show dates initials and car numbers as reported and as should have been reported also difference Dr or Cr 6 In cases where such discrepancies become chronic the pool to place a joint man to locate the responsibility the expense of such joint man to be paid by the road at fault 7 The balance Dr or Cr to be carried forward each day the cars deliv ered the current day added the cars received deducted and balance Dr or Cr shown and certified to Not later than the 5th of each month a sum mary of the past month to be rendered by the agent of the delivering line to the agent of the receiving line showing by date the daily balances which must be certified to at once 8 The Dr balance to be paid for at such flat rates as may be agreed upon or may be based on some sort of a graduated plan about as follows First fifteen days at  25 cents per car per day The sixteenth day at 30     The seventeenth day at 35   The eighteenth day at 4o     The nineteenth day at 45   The twentieth day at 50      The twentyfirst day at 55  The twentysecond day at 6o      The twentythird day at 65     The twentyfourth day at 70      The twentyfifth day at 75    The twentysixth day at 8o      The twentyseventh day at 85     The twentyeighth day at go      The twentyninth day at 95     The thirtieth day at i per car per day and thereafter at 1 per car per day 264Pooling of Freight Cars 21 The holding of any individual car in excess of 6o days to be charged for at agreed rate per car per day in addition to the exchange balance rates as may be agreed on Another plan that suggests itself is in addition to a flat rate for Dr balance each day to have an arbitrary percentage of all revenues received from freight switching car service etc deducted and Cr to poolto be divided pro rata on equitable basis or used to maintain full quota of cars in pool 9 All cars to be repaired on the line where cars are in bad order under rules to be agreed upon by the M C B of lines in the pool Io Cars accepted in bad order to be transferred at expense of deliv ering line ix In cases of cars destroyed such destruction of car to be reported by wire or United States mail from date of such notice the road destroying the car to be entitled to a claim of not to exceed 60 days for rebuilding the car or thirty days to pay for the same if payment is made then the commissioner or manager shall credit such road and debit the car owner 12 In cases of new cars built such cars when traveling under freight charges shall not be counted in exchange account and shall be shown on in terchange report as new cars and credit shown thereon when such cars are delivered to connecting road for service then such road shall be debited with such cars and owners credited Cars returned under M C B route cards to be credited same as goodorder cars 13 When a road cannot receive traffic on account of congestion em bargo or other causes it must protect itself by stopping receipt or loading for such line until interchange is resumed or it may be arranged between such lines to hold such traffic and bill on line requesting cars held Make it a matter of local arrangement and in no way interfere with exchange ac count 14 In the case of cars in switching service the roads in interest to arrange to bill each other for such cars for the actual time such cars are in the service of the carrier line plus one day for switching and one day for the return of car

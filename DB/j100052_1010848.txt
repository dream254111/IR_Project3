J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1010848,THE POOLING OF FREIGHT CARS,I242580,THE POOLING OF FREIGHT CARS BY J R CAVANAGH SUPERINTENDENT CAR SERVICE CLEVELAND CINCINNATI CHICAGO AND ST LOUIS RAILWAY COMPANY INDIANAPOLIS IND THE INABILITY OF MANY OF THE RAILROADS OF THE COUNTRY OR PORTIONS OF NUMEROUS OTHER RAILROAD SYSTEMS TO HANDLE PROMPNTLY THE FREIGHT OFFERED FOR TRANSPORTATION HAS INCREASED THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVISING SOME METHOD OF ADDING TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ENORMOUS FREIGHT CAR EQUIPMENT NOW IN USE UPON AMERICAN RAILWAYS THERE IS NO TOPIC IN RAILWAY MANAGEMENT MORE DISCUSSED THAN THE CAR SHORTAGE OR CAR SURPLUS QUESTION THIS IS A COMPARATIVELY RECENT PROBLEM THAT HAS ARISEN AS THE RESULT PRIMARILY OF THE ENORMOUS INCREASE IN TRAFFIC DURING THE PAST SEVEN YEARS AND SECONDARILY OF THE STEADY DEVELOPMENT OF THROUGH SHIPMENTS OR LONGDISTANCE TRAFFIC THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY THE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED POPULATION AND INDUSTRY AND THE GROWING UNIFICATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS OF THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE ARE CAUSING THE FORMER METHOD OF INTERCHANGING CARS TO BECOME ANTIQUATED AND PRACTICALLY UNWORKABLE PRIOR TO 1872 CONNECTING RAILWAY COMPANIES DID NOT EXCHANGE FREIGHT CARS REGULARLY EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF CARS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO FREIGHT LINES AND WHICH WERE MARKED AND KNOWN AS LINE CARS THE PAYMENT FOR THE USE OF CARS THAT WERE INTERCHANGED WAS MADE BY JUNCTION AGENTS AT THE RATE OF TWO CENTS PER LOADED MILE RUN IN 1872 THIS CHARGE WAS REDUCED TO ONE CENT PER MILE RUN LOADED OR EMPTY SETTLEMENT BEING MADE BY THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT OF THE COMPANY BORROWING THE CAR BY A REPORT MADE TO THE CORRESPONDING DEPARTMENT OF THE COMPANY OWNING THE CAR IN AUGUST 1876 THE PAYMENT PER MILE RUN WAS REDUCED TO THREEQUARTERS OF A CENT AND LATER A FURTHER REDUCTION TO THREEFIFTHS OF A CENT WAS MADE THE CHARGE IN EACH CASE BEING FOR THE ENTIRE DISTANCE TRAVELED BY THE CAR WHETHER LOADED OR EMPTY THIS SYSTEM OF PAYMENT UPON THE BASIS OF MILEAGE PROVED FAIRLY SATISFACTORY DURING THE PROSPEROUS YEARS PRECEDING 1893 THEN 260POOLING OF FREIGHT CARS 17 WHEN THE PANIC CAME WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS OF BUSINESS DEPRESSION THE RAILROADS OF THE COUNTRY WERE TROUBLED WITH A SURPLUS RATHER THAN WITH A SHORTAGE OF EQUIPMENT MANY ROADS WERE GLAD TO HAVE THEIR EQUIPMENT USED BY OTHER COMPANIES DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1893 TO 1899 THERE WAS CDMPARATIVELY LITTLE INCREASE IN THE FREIGHT CAR EQUIPMENT AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT WHEN BUSINESS BECAME ACTIVE JUST BEFORE 1900 EVERY RAILROAD SOON BEGAN TO CLAMOR FOR CARS THE SITUATION WHICH BEGAN TO DEVELOP IN 89919OO00 HAS GROWN STEADILY MORE ACUTE YEAR BY YEAR UNTIL AT THE PRESENT TIME EVERY RAILROAD COMPANY IS OBLIGED TO CONFESS ITSELF UNABLE TO SUPPLY THE SHIPPERS PROMPTLY AND ADEQUATELY WITH A SUFFI CIENT NUMBER OF CARS VARIOUS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO DEAL WITH THIS STEADILY IN CREASING DIFFICULTY AND PERPLEXITY AS A RESULT OF AN AGITATION IN 19O0 THE RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES ON THE IST OF JULY 1902 CHANGED THE BASIS OF SETTLEMENT FOR THE USE OF FOREIGN CARS FROM MILES RUN TO A PER DIEM BASIS THE PAYMENT AGREED UPON WAS TWENTY CENTS PER DAY THE OWNER OF THE CAR HAVING THE RIGHT TO DEMAND ITS RETURN WHEN THE CAR HAD BEEN ABSENT FROM ITS LINES TWENTY DAYS IF THE CAR WAS NOT RETURNED WITHIN TEN DAYS THEREAFTER VIZ THIRTY DAYS FROM THE TIME IT LEFT THE LINE OF THE OWNING COMPANY THE PER DIEM CHARGE WAS ADVANCED FROM TWENTY CENTS TO ONE DOLLAR IT WAS HOPED THAT THIS CHANGE IN THE PAYMENT FOR THE USE OF FOREIGN CARS WOULD SOLVE THE QUESTION IT DID INDEED PROVE TO BE MUCH SUPERIOR TO THE MILEAGE BASIS OF PAYMENT AND EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT TIME IS A BETTER STANDARD THAN MILEAGE IN FIXING THE CHARGES FOR THE RENTAL OF CARS A FUNDAMENTAL DEFECT IN THE PER DIEM PENALTY PLAN OF CHARGING FOR THE USE OF FOREIGN CARS IS BECOMING EVIDENT IT HAS HAD THE EFFECT OF POOLING CARS MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF ROADS RECEIVING LARGE VOLUMES OF INBOUND BUSINESS AND OF TAKING EQUIPMENT AWAY FROM THE LINES OF ROADS HAVING A LARGE OUTBOUND TRAFFIC THUS FOR IN STANCE ROAD A MIGHT DELIVER IOOO CARS TO ROAD B IN A MONTH WHILE DURING THE SAME TIME ROAD B WOULD HAVE ONLY 6OO CARLOADS OF FREIGHT FOR DELIVERY TO A IF UNDER THESE CONDITIONS B HAD AN UNUSUAL DEMAND FOR CARS IT WOULD RETAIN THE 400 CARS THUS RECEIVED IN EXCESS OF THOSE GIVEN IT AND USE THE SAME TO CARRY ON ITS BUSINESS WITH OTHER COMPANIES VIZ TO SUPPLY ITS OWN EQUIPMENT NEEDS THE METHOD OF PAYING FOR THE USE OF FOREIGN CARS DOES NOT INSURE A 261I8 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PROMPT RETURN TO ROAD A OF THE EQUIPMENT SENT OUT BY IT IN EXCESS OF THE EQUIPMENT RECEIVED IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF TRAFFIC COMING TO IT FROM CONNECTING LINES RAILROAD COMPANIES THAT ARE LARGE ORIG INATORS OF TRAFFIC ARE EASILY DENUDED OF EQUIPMENT AND ARE WITHOUT THE POWER UNDER THE PRESENT RULES TO GET THEIR CARS BACK WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME AS THE DEMAND FOR CARS HAS INCREASED AS STORAGE FACILITIES HAVE BECOME INADEQUATE WITH THE GROWTH OF TRAFFIC AND AS THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF MILES WHICH A CARLOAD OF FREIGHT IS MOVED HAS GROWN GREATLY THE PER DIEM OF TWENTY CENTS HAS COME TO BE ENTIRELY INADEQUATE THIS FACT WAS SO CLEARLY RECOGNIZED BY RAILROADS THAT ON THE IST OF JANUARY 19O6 THE PER DIEM WAS RAISED TO TWENTYFIVE CENTS PER CAR WITH A PER DIEM PENALTY OF SEVENTYFIVE CENTS ADDITIONAL AT THE END OF THIRTY DAYS THIS INCREASE WAS SOON SHOWN TO BE INSUFFI CIENT AND THE RESULT WAS THAT IN THE AUTUMN OF 19O6 A NUMBER OF RAILROADS AGREED AMONG THEMSELVES TO CHARGE EACH OTHER TEMPO RARILY A PER DIEM OF FIFTY CENTS WITHOUT THE PENALTY FEATURE THE ROADS WHICH DID NOT BECOME PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HAVE CON TINUED TO CHARGE THE OLD RATES OF TWENTYFIVE CENTS PER DAY INCREASING TO ONE DOLLAR PER DAY TO THE END OF THIRTY DAYS EVEN THE PER DIEM CHARGE OF FIFTY CENTS HAS NOT MET THE SITUA TION THERE IS STILL A SEVERE CAR SHORTAGE AND IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE RAILROADS TO SECURE FROM THE CAR BUILDERS A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CARS DURING THE PRESENT CALENDAR YEAR TO RELIEVE THE SITUATION AT THE CLOSE OF JANUARY 1907 A NUMBER OF RAILROADS AGREED TO ENTER A FREIGHT CAR POOL PROVIDED A SATISFACTORY PLAN FOR REGULATING SUCH A POOL COULD BE WORKED OUT THUS FAR NO PRACTICAL PLAN HAS YET BEEN PRESENTED EVERYBODY SEEMS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PER DIEM SYSTEM OF PAYMENT OUGHT TO BE CHANGED BUT THE PROBLEM OF WORKING OUT A CAR POOLING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO ALL PARTIES IN INTEREST HAS THUS FAR PROVEN IMPOSSIBLE OF SOLUTION ONE THING HOWEVER IS CERTAIN THE RULES THAT HAVE BEEN RECOM MENDED PROVIDING FOR THE RETURN OF CARS AS PER MARKS OR OWNERSHIP ARE IMPRACTICABLE FOR THE REASONS THAT EVERY RESTRICTION PLACED UPON THE FNOVEMENT OF A CAR REDUCES ITS AVAILABILITY INCREASES THE MILEAGE WHICH IT TRAVELS WITHOUT A LOAD AND ADDS TO THE TIME AND EXPENSE REQUIRED FOR SWITCHING SOMEPLAN MUST BE FOUND FOR CONTROLLING THE MOVEMENT OF FREIGHT CARS BEFORE TRAFFIC OFFICIALS CAN HOPE TO DISCOVER A PRACTICAL SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM 262POOLING OF FREIGHT CARS 19 IN ORDER TO DEAL ADEQUATELY WITH THE DISTRIBUTION AND MOVE MENT OF CARS A SYSTEM MUST BE ESTABLISHED THAT WILL BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES I EQUITY MUST BE SECURED ALIKE TO OWNER AND USER OF THE CAR VIZ TO BOTH DELIVERING AND RECEIVING LINES 2 THE PAYMENT MUST REWARD THE EFFICIENT USE OF EQUIPMENT AND ADEQUATELY PENALIZE ITS INEFFICIENT USE 3 THE REWARD SHOULD BE IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF MERIT AND THE PENALTY SHOULD CORRESPOND WITH THE DEGREE OF THE OFFENSE 4 THE SYSTEM OF CONTROL SHOULD MINIMIZE OPERATING EXPENSES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND SHOULD PROVIDE DEFINITELY FOR SETTLEMENTS DAY BY DAY OR WEEK BY WEEK BETWEEN THE DELIVERING AND RECEIVING LINES 5 NO UNADJUSTED DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN CAR OWNER AND USER SHOULD BE PERMITTED 6 THE SYSTEM SHOULD INSURE TO EACH ROAD THE FULL USE OF ITS OWN EQUIPMENT OR OF CARS PROVIDING AN EQUIVALENT EQUIPMENT 7 THE SYSTEM SHOULD PROVIDE FOR MAXIMUM LOADS AND SHOULD MINIMIZE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE EMPTYHAUL MILEAGE IN THE OPINION OF THE WRITER THESE PRINCIPLES OF CAR CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION CAN BE CARRIED OUT IN PRACTICE ONLY BY A SYSTEM OF POOL ING FREIGHT CARS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EQUITABLE ARRANGEMENT THAT WILL PREVENT THE APPROPRIATION BY ANY ONE OR MORE LINES OF THE LARGER AND BETTER CARS AND THAT WILL PROVIDE FOR A DAILY SETTLEMENT BETWEEN DELIVERING AND RECEIVING LINES THIS SYSTEM WOULD MINIMIZE THE EXPENSES OF OPERATION AND MAXIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE EQUIPMENT AS THE RESULT OF A CAREFUL STUDY OF THE SUBJECT AND OF BUSINESS EXPERI ENCE THE AUTHOR RECOMMENDS THE FOLLOWING PLAN FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF A FREIGHT CAR POOL HE BELIEVES THAT IT SOLVES EVERY ELEMENT OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT ITS ADOPTION BY THE RAILROADS GENERALLY IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD ENORMOUSLY INCREASE THE EFFI CIENCY OF THEIR FREIGHT EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED PLAN I

this rather remarkable piece of misinformation RESIDENT ALIENS The expected declaration by Congress that a state of war ex ists between the United States and Germany will automatically alter the status of German subjects residing here No such per son can be accepted as a citizen during the continuance of the war and our courts will be closed to them the plea that they are alien enemies being a sufficient answer to any legal remedy they may ask All commercial partnerships between them and citizens of this country will be dissolved no patents or copy rights can be issued to them no moneys due can be transferred to German subjects resident in Germany and some cases have gone so far as to hold that an action pending in court wherein an alien enemy subject is a plaintiff abates at a declaration of war Iowever interesting this may be as an exhibition of editorial sapience few lawyers having charge of a case for or against a resident alien of enemy nationality will care to take their law from it The question of the status of such persons as litigants is however of considerable present interest and as it is one with which the present generation of lawyers have happily not heretofore had occasion to become familiar a resume of the case law of the subject may be of use to the readers of CASE AND COMMENT While it is true that an enemy can neither institute an action

our courts Spch is the case of an outlaw But in Viola v MacKenzie M  Co 1915  Quebec  24 D L R 208 it is said that the restriction of the right to sue does not result from the incapacity of foreigner but from the fact that the enemy country will profit by executing a judgment in his favor By the policy of the law alien enemies shall not be admitted to actions to recover effects which may be

by which an alien enemy is precluded from enforcing his rights of action during the continuance of war is not abrogated by art 23 h of chap 1  2 of the Annex to the Hague Convention of 1907 by which it is for bidden to declare abolished suspended or inadmissible the right of the subjects of the hostile party to institute legal proceed ings but such provision is in view of its collocation to be read as forbidding any declaration by the military commander of a belligerent force in the occupation of the enemys territory which will prevent the inhabitants of that territory from using their courts of law in order to assert or protect their civil rightsl15 This disability extends to suits in which the nonresident enemy is the real party in interest Thus an action is not maintainable by an agent on behalf of his principal where the principal is an alien enemy 6 nor may he be appointed as a receiver of the assets of his principals business for the purpose of enabling him to collect debts due to his principal17 So an alien enemy cannot bring suit in the name of a trustee not an alien as the public policy which forbids that the property sued for should be car ried out of the country to enrich the enemy would be violated equally in the one case as in the other8 And it has been held that an action for wrongful death cannot be maintained by the administrator of a decedent where the persons for whose benefit the action is given are alien enemies19 Alien enemies are in capable of making a valid demise for the purpose of maintaining 152 Porter v Freudenberg 1915 1 K B 857 5 B R C

enemy the other plaintiff may move to amend his writ by striking out the name of his coplaintiff22 The disability of an alien enemy to sue is so extended as to prevent him from gaining any advantage for himself and his country and therefore he is not only disabled from suing for the purpose of procuring any immediate relief but he is not allowed to obtain testimony by a bill of discovery in equity so as thereby to lay a foundation for obtaining relief elsewhere23 though where sued he may have a discovery for the purpose of copducting his defense just as hie would be allowed process to compel the attendance of his witnesses24 The right to recover a debt being only suspended during and not extinguished by the war an alien enemy may make a claim in a bankruptcy proceeding though dividends thereon will be withheld until the conclusion of peace2 But an alien enemy tesident in the enemy country cannot be heard during the war to complain of the rejection of a claim filed by him

implied from the fact of the process of the court and I express no opinion upon it It may be that in this case the war has so hampered the defendants in the preparation of their case in their

be made and his right to issue execu tion should be suspended until the cessation of the state of hos tilities52 An alien enemy who is respondent to a petition for revoca tion of a patent and against whom the operation of a decree revoking the patent is suspended by an appeal cannot claim that the hearing of the appeal must be suspended during the war52a A defendants privilege of being sued in the county where he resides ceases when he voluntarily becomes an alien enemy53 Although the enemy character of a defendant does not pre clude the maintenance of an action against him it isneverthe less essential to the rendition of a valid judgment that the court acquire jurisdiction Unless he has some agent in the country upon whom process may be served it is generally necessary to resort to service by publication and whether jurisdiction may be acquired in this way is a controverted question Inasmuch as intercourse between citizens of belligerent states is ordinarily unlawful the status of an enemy differs from that of an or dinary nonresident defendant and this has influenced some courts to hold that constructive service upon such an one is ineffectual54 According to other courts however it would seem that the non intercourse rule is to be relaxed pro hac vice since they hold that service by publication is good55 51 Albretcht v Sussmann 1813 2 Ves  B 323 13 Revised Rep 110 52

180 55 In Seymour v Bailey 1872 66 Ill 288 it was held that a pres idential proclamation issued in pursuance of an act of Congress pro 104  JuneALIEN ENEMIES AS LITIGANTS In a Maryland case56 the court in discussing the validity of a judgment rendered against an alien enemy upon service by pub lication said The argument in favor of the appellant stated in its strong est light is this The object of the order of publication made under the law affecting an absent or nonresident defendant is to notify and warn him to appear by a certain day in court and defend his rights that no man can have those rights impaired in any court without an opportunity of so defending them and no court has jurisdiction over them until it has afforded him such opportunity that the notice thus given is equivalent to personal notice by the service of a writ and all proceedings are void unless one notice or the other is given that whilst war exists the notice by order of publication is utterly futile and unlawful all intercourse between the citizens of the respective governments being prohibited that it could not possibly reach the party for whom it was intended because no communication could be had between the place of publication and the place where the party intended to be notified resided at the time and even if by legal possibility such notice could reach him still being an enemy he could not appear and defend the notice therefore in this case was a notice which could not possibly reach the appel lant requiring him to do a thing which he could not possibly per forma notice impossible to be known to do a thing impossible to be doneand such an order of publication must by consequence be utterly futile illegal and void But a brief examination of the provisions purpose and object of the law relating to non resident owners of property here situated who are made de fendants in chancery suits in this state affecting such property will we think afford a sufficient answer to this argument All that the law requires in such cases is that the court shall order notice to be given by publication in one or more newspapers stating the substance and object of the bill and warning the hibiting all commercial intercourse with the enemy does not sus pend the operation of statutes authorizing the prosecution of suits against nonresident defendants upon constructive service by pub lication of notice so as to deprive the courts in such cases of all jurisdiction and to render their proceedings null and void 56 Dorsey v Dorsey 1869 30 Md 522 96 Am Dec 633 105 1917 3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S nonresident to appear on or before a day fixed in its order and show cause why the relief prayed should not be granted such notice to be published as the court may direct but not less than once a week for four successive weeks three months before the day fixed by the order for the appearance of the party and if he does not appear at the time stated the court is then author ized to proceed in the case by passing a decree pro confesso or taking testimony ex parte and then to final decree upon the subjectmatter    Strict compliance with the requisites of the statute is demanded but when this is done and the case has proceeded to final decree the property sold and title acquired thereunder the courts wilF not listen to any evidence that the party has not or could not actually receive the notice or make his appearance It is simply a statutory mode of conferring upon the court power to pass judgment on property the sub jectmatter of suit within its jurisdiction when the owner is beyond the reach of its process The courts in such cases act upon the presumption of notice which they will not allow to be rebutted The whole theory of the law of constructive notice rests upon this foundation In numerous cases an equal im possibility of receiving and complying with the notice exists as in the case of war A party may be sick or imprisoned in a distant land at such place and under such circumstances that within the time limited no notice could by any possibility reach him but this or any other vis major or act of God will not oust the jurisdiction of the court over his property once ob tained by pursuing the requirements of the statute or defeat the title acquired under its final decree thereon If war and residence in enemys territory can be set up to avoid the pro ceedings ahd defeat the title there is no good reason why any other cause creating an equal impossibility of receiving notice should not be allowed to have the same effect This would defeat the very object of the law embarrass judicial proceed ings and render insecure titles derived under judicial sales There is a third group of cases which without going so far as to assert that jurisdiction may be acquired by constructive service over a nonresident enemy hold that a citizen may be proceeded against by publication as an absentee notwithstand 106  JuneALIEN ENEMIES AS LITIGANTS ing he has become an adherent of the enemy57 The same difference of opinion pervades the decisions on the question whether the property of a nonresident alien enemy may be reached by attachment58 Where it is sought to enforce a mortgage deed of trust or other lien for the security of a debt a further difficulty is raised 57 Thus in Dorsey v Thompson 1872 37 Md 25 it was held that an alien enemy may be served by publication where he has become such since the commencement of the war at which time he was a resident citizen In Ludlowv v Ramsey 1871 11 Wall 581 20 L ed 216 it is held that if a party voluntarily leaves his country or his residence for the purpose of engaging in hostilities against the former he cannot com plain of legal proceedings regularly prosecuted against him as an absentee In Peerce v Carskadon 1870 4 W Va 234 6 Am Rep 281 a statute providing that if parties were in sympathy with the Rebel lion and had left their usual places of abode and were out of the reach of civil process for ninety days they were to be regarded as nonresidents was held not to be invalid as violating vested rights or as an ex post facto law 58 In Thomas v Mahone 1872 9 Bush 111 it was held that it does not follow because a person is an alien enemy with whom all unlicensed communication is forbidden that resident creditors may not sue him and subject to the payment of their debts such of his property as may be found within the jurisdiction The land of a nonresident enemy may be sold for the payment of his debts Crutcher v Hord 1868 4 Bush 363 The fact that a debtor is an alien enemy will not preclude from proceeding by attachment against his property Mixer v Sibtey 1869 53 Ill 61 Selden v Preston 11 Bush 191 Jenkins v Hannan 1884 26 Fed 657 A citizen creditor may sue by attachment to obtain satisfaction from a nonresident alien enemy debtor Hepburns Case 1830 3 Bland Ch 95 The property of one who voluntarily becQmes an alien enemy is subject to attachment His being an alien enemy does not make him the less a nonresident debtor Dorsey v Kyle 1869 30 Md 512 96 Am Dec 617 But in Haymond v Camden 1883 22 W Va 180 it was neld that a suit instituted by a creditor during the war to enforce the pay ment of his debt by attachment against the property of a debtor who is in the position of an alien enemy or to enforce a vendors lien is without legal sanction or authority and all proceedings had therein are void 1917  107108 3 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  June by the contention that as payment of a debt during the war is unlawful it is not legally due and therefore that no resort may be had to the security59 Some courts have however declined to give effect to the above contention where the debtor was originally a citizen of the state but has become an adherent of the enemy80 appar ently on the illogical ground that the conduct of such a person deserves to be visited with a penalty These cases which were occasioned by the Civil War and the decisions in which may have been influenced by partisan feeling are open to criticism as disregarding the legal right of all the citizens of a nation to take sides in a civil conflict together with the consequence attaching to the status of belligerents so acquired A distinction between sales by judicial proceedings and a sale under a power contained in a mortgage or deed of trust is made in a United States Supreme Court case61 where it is said The argument is that inasmuch as all commercial intercourse 59 Kanawha Coal Co v Kanawha  O Coal Co 1870 7 Blatchf 391 Fed Cas No 7606 Walker v Beauchler 1876 27 Gratt 511

mortgage is valid where the mortgagor left the state for the purpose of engaging in hostilites The real estate of a nonresident enemy situated in the state may be subject to the payment of a debt contracted before the war began and secured by a mortgage on the property itself executed and re corded while the debtor himself was a resident of the state Dorsey v Dorsey 1869 30 Md 522 96 Am Dec 633 And a bill of equity will not lie to redeem lands sold under a deed of trust on the ground that the maker was when the land was sold a member of the enemys forces and a prisoner of war where it further appeared that he had voluntarily become an alien enemy Black v Gregg 1875 58 Mo 565 In Johns v Slack 1875 2 Hughes 467 Fed Cas No 7363 it was held that lands might be sold to satisfy the vendors claim for unpaid purchase money though the purchaser was absent during war with the other belligerent power and had no notice of the motion for the sale or of the sale itself 61 Washington University v Finch 1873 18 Wall 106 21 L Ed 818 So also in other cases it has been held that the absolute power toALIEN ENEMIES AS LITIGANTS was forbidden between the people of the loyal states and those residing in the insurrectionary district both by virtue of the act of Congress and by the principles applicable to nations in a state of war all processes for the collection of debts were sus pended and that the complainants being forbidden by these principles to pay the debt there could be no valid sale of the land for default of such payment The case before us was not one of sale by judicial proceeding No aid of a court was needed or called for It was purely the case of the execution of a power by a person in whom a trust had been reposed in regard to real estate the land the trustee and the cestui que trust all being as they had always been within a state whose citizens were loyally supporting the nation in its struggle with its enemies    The debt was due and unpaid The obli gation which the trustee had assumed on a condition had be come absolute by the presence of that condition    The power under which the sale was made was irrevocable The creditor had both a legal and a moral right to have the power made for his benefit executed The enforced absence of the complainants if it be conceded that it was enforced does not in our judgment afford a sufficient reason for arresting his agent and the agent of the creditor in performing a duty which both of them imposed upon him before the war began His power over the subject was perfect the right of the holder of the note to have him exercise that power was perfect Its ex ercise required no intercourse commercial or otherwise with the complainants No military transaction would be interfered with by the sale The enemy instead of being strengthened would have been weakened by the process The interest of tne complainants in the land might have been liable to confiscation sell on default conferred upon the trustee in a deed of trust to secure a debt may be exercised notwithstanding the debtor is an alien enemy De Jarnette v De Giverville 1874 56 Mo 440 where how ever it appeared that the time the default was made there was no suspension of intercourse between the state of the plaintiff and that of the defendant Martin v Paxson 1877 66 Mo 260 where it ap peared that the trustor had voluntarily gone within the enemys lines Mitchell v Nodaway County 1883 80 Mo 257 Washington University v Finch 1873 18 Wall 106 21 L Ed 818 Willard v Boggs 1870 56 Ill 163 Bush v Sherman 1875 80 Ill 160 1917  1093 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S by the government yet we are told that this right of the cred itor could not be enforced nor the power of the trustee lawfully exercised No authority in this country or any other is shown to us for this proposition It rests upon inference from the general doctrine of absolute nonintercourse between citizens of states which are in a state of public war with each other but no case has been cited of this kind even in such a war It is said that the power to sell in the deed of trust required a no tice of the sale in a newspaper that this notice was intended to apprise the complainants of the time and place of sale and that inasmuch as it was impossible for such notice to reach the com plainants no sale could be made If this reasoning were sound the grantors in such a deed need only go to a place where the newspaper could never reach them to delay the sale indefinitely or defeat it altogether But the notice is not for the benefit of the grantor in the sense of notice to him It is only for his benefit by giving notoriety and publicity of the time the terms and the place of sale and of the property to be sold that bid ders may be invited competition encouraged and a fair price obtained for theproperty As to the grantor he is presumed to know that he is in default and his property liable to sale at any time and no notice to him is required RIGHT TO HABEAS CORPUS A prisoner of war is not entitled to the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus to examine ifto the propriety of his deten tion62 even though he is the subject of a neutral power and had been forcibly compelled to serve on board the enemys ship where he was taken63 It has even been held that the court will not grant a habeas corpus ad testificandum to bring up a pris oner of war as a witness64 The rule that the court will not entertain an application for habeas corpus from a prisoner of war has been held to apply to a civilian subject of an enemy state who has been interned

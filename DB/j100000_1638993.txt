Professor J McKeen Cattell Garrison onHudson N Y THE FORTHCOMING SITUATION IN AGRICULTURAL WORKII ONE year ago at the first meeting of Section M it was my privilege to speak on some of the tendencies in the great public agricultural movements in the United States particularly on the educational side and to express my conviction that the proc esses set in motion by the LandGrant Act and subsequent enactments are safeguard ing the foundations of our democracy I approached my subject mostly from the point of view of our present publicservice or publicwelfare institutions for agricul ture I said that I should discuss the other or nonpublic phases of the problem one year hence And now after twelve months of unrepentance I come to resume my theme In continuing the discussion I shall be obliged to reaffirm some of the posi tions that I urged a year ago It is now some seven years ago when I wrote in a book that there may be need of a kind of agricultural work that can best be done in an institution independent of direct state support and not at once respon sible to popular will2 That statement or its equivalent had been made many times theretofore in public ways I have never taken the privilege however to enlarge upon it to any degree this opportunity is reserved for today Fortunate it is for us that our educa tional and to a large extent our civic and welfare work for agriculture have been founded on public funds thereby commit ting the state to the necessity of furthering the interests of our basic industry and of 1 Retiring vicepresidential address Section M 2 TThe Training of Farmers page 225 L     LiiaN S VOL XLIII No 1099 making it an active factor in the political establishment Had all this chain of col leges of agriculture and experiment sta tions and the great range of extension work and the giving of expert advice been estab lished on private gifts they would have been philanthropies or at least concessions to a needy industry The state has recog nized the necessity to base itself on the earth and the enterprise is generously supported This then is my starting pointthat these statemaintained institutions which aim to safeguard and to develop the re sources of the earth are essential to per manency in society and also to selfgovern ment Having accepted this basis we may now ask whether there is need for another set or kind of institutions dealing with the rural situation or whether such a set would benefit or hinder the public establishments that are now so well developed Let me say at once that the field of such institutions whether public semipublic or private is now well understood The prophetic writings in this naturefield and this agriculturefield are of our own time and of the time just preceding us The philosophy of the situation in its great human bearings and in its governmental and social results has been clearly pro jected The fundamental statements have been made The main forecasts are mostly recent We are emerging from the genera tion of search for the underlying elements and of the prophecy for future action We enter the generation of hopeful and con structive application At last we begin to see the actual reshaping of country life THE PROBLEM OF OVERADMINISTRATION As our philosophy begins now to shape itself into definite action so do our colleges and experiment stations begin to take on an institutional character With the pas sage of the Extension Act the institutions become real parts in a national system Ad ministration is now the dominant note in them whereas formerly the work and at tainments of individual men gave them their distinction In the nature of the case the administrative forces will increase the elements must be organized it is easier and simpler to make plans of administra tion than to do good research work or su perlative teaching Persons of little train ing in productive work are now engaged in making plans of administration a situa tion that is always dangerous It is of the first importance both to the work itself and to the political democracy we represent that we do not think of agri cultural education and research primarily in terms of organization In this country where we are all sovereigns and all poli ticians it is the easiest thing to slip into political methods not to say political prac tises in education We must be on our guard against the spiritless domination that is likely to arise in educational and inves tigational endeavor when it becomes for mal and be aware of those tendencies that confuse redtape and obstructive duties with administration An enterprise is not commendable merely because it is reg ular and smoothrunning It is a sad case if personality is ever subordinated to regularity A man is always more impor tant than a rule The tendency toward outside centralized administrative control is well seen in move ments now under way in this country to eliminate duplication and conflict between public institutions in a given state by means of one board of control placed over all of them or by one chancellorship administer ing all of them from a common office If it is desirable to conserve the free action and the spirit of a teacher or an officer as a 78 SCIENCEJANUARY 21 1916 means of maintaining the essential forces in a free people without peasantry so is it necessary also to safeguard the independ ence of the institution that holds the teach ers Every institution is entitled to its own life It would be a vast misfortune if all our state educational institutions were made to be uniform in procedure even when they are of the same grade or rank Diversity is the order of nature We are now run wild in this country in the application of socalled efficiency systems to institutions and agencies that in the nature of their purpose ought to be of the spirit rather than of the letter Often these systems do not really represent efficiency but the effort of officers and clerks without either vision or discretion and perhaps supercilious to make all things uniform and more time and money may be lost in this effort than is saved in the purchase of supplies or in the stoppage of the leaks It is a serious case to deprive the responsible officer of an in stitution of the right to exercise his dis cretion It is a gross mistake to suppose that man agement systems usually applicable to a fac tory can be applied to a college or a univer sity or to an experiment station or a re search laboratory and for the very good reason that the products are wholly unlike manufactured goods in the one case hu man souls and scientific truth in the other So also are the methods of procedure un liketimework and a measurable output in the one case study reflection mental recuperation inspiration soulservice in the other The institutions must be al lowed to become what they are intended to be We are face to face with a struggle to keep educational institutions free not so much from political control as from the deadening domination of fiscal offices A wellknown professor in a college of agri culture writes me that his institution has now become so efficient that he loses one third of his time from all productive work and another declares that frequently he spends an entire day in making reports that have no significance except to maintain a scheme of administration and which could be performed just as well by a tendollar clerk All this means that we are in imme diate danger of developing in our institu tions a set of administrative officers con trolling affairs who are separate in spirit from the real work of research and educa tion To this tendency add the present peril of similar despotism from state officers and you have a slowly developing method of strangulation that may well cause alarm If you ask me how we are to avoid these duplications and conflicts between state in stitutions then I reply that the remedy lies in the constitution of the institutions them selves and not in the method of governance You can not bring together by any means of overhead regulation institutions that in themselves are inharmonious You may al lay the hostilities by arbitrary regulation you may prevent duplication but this is not a solution but only an adjustment and the arbitrary regulation of finances and ac counts will inevitably in the end control the educational policies of the institutions and will ultimately deprive them of inde pendent freespirited presidents and lead ers The danger lies in the future rather than in the present The real remedy for such situations rests with the constitution or the legislature or with bodies to which it delegates legislative authority to define the purposes and the spheres of the insti tutions with their charts before them the institutions then undertake each its own voyage There is still another aspect to this un fortunate hostility between state institu tions It is the championship of the insti SCIENCE 79N S VoL XLIII No 1099 tution by alumni in their organizations and elsewhere and which may practically en force the necessity of exterior regulation The alumni loyalty is a fine spirit much to be desired but the first loyalty in the case of publicmaintained institutions is to the state rather than to the college The alumni attitude of the older eastern en dowed colleges has been transferred bodily to state colleges without discrimination and without realization of the fact that state relationships are involved Herein lies one danger of alumni trustees in state institu tions although the alumni ought to make the best of advisers If we could get hold of the alumni bodies on the basis of good state policies rather than on the basis of blind partisanship we should soon be able to solve most of our institutional conflicts at the same time that we retain the needful support of the alumni of each one of them We should then be free to make our institutions parts in a wellunderstood state program and to allow each institution to work out most of its own problems Undoubtedly some small dupli cations or perhaps even infringements would remain but they would be devoid of hostility and have little power for evil whereas the gains to come from free action would far outweigh any lack of conformity to an office or paper plan It ought not to be difficult to make adjustments by means of conference if the underlying situation is properly established How to bring these alumni bodies to their senses is indeed a difficult problem As these persons have been educated at state expense so does the state have a right to ask service in return and if necessary I should go so far as to give the alumni or ganizations legal standing and more or less state control I feel however that the bet ter result can be secured by processes of suasion If a governor of a state or the presidents of the institutions or a few leading spirits in the alumni associations were to make an appeal along these lines the whole situation would probably right itself in the course of a few years It is more important first to appeal to the alumni than to the legislature We are in too great haste to eliminate these difficulties We must remember that these situations are the results of longcontinued conditions the difficulties are chronic and ingrained so will it require time to work them out We are to undo the mischief by gradually re versing or at least revising the process not by a broadside of regulatory legislation All these foregoing statements indicate the drift of the time in the direction of overadministration coupled with more or less hasty legislative enactments to meet special troubles The remedy does not lie wholly and perhaps not even chiefly within the establishments themselves in fact rou tine tends to multiply and to extol itself as desirable on its own account Reforma tion is peculiarly the work of outsiders The course of our legislation in the field of education in agriculture shows a gradual federalizing of it beginning with practi cally entire freedom in the original Land Grant Act In the new SmithLever Act the remedyif a remedy is neededdoes not lie within itself Cooperation is not a remedy it is an adjustment a method of procedure and it works only when all the parties agree If the LandGrant Act had been written and applied on the same prin ciple we could not have had our existing colleges of agriculture ANOTHER KIND OF AGRICULTURAL WORK Well then where is the external influence to be maintained Where is it to arise Primarily in the suggestions of a free peo ple But its continuous practise must come from institutions SCIENCE 80JANUARY 21 1916 There may be need also of a kind of agricul tural work that can best be done in an institution that is independent of direct state support and that is not at once responsible to popular will The fuller statement from which this sentence is a quotation is this The teaching of agriculture of college and uni versity grade ought not to be confined to colleges of agriculture All universities at least on their own account and for their own best development will in time have departments of agriculture if they are real universities as much as they have departments of language or of engineering They can not neglect any fundamental branches of learn ing3 At an earlier date I had written It is strange that private benevolence has not discovered that the founding of schools of agri culture is one of the very best means of serving mankind4 As these statements seem not always to have meant the same to others as I thought they meant to me I shall now enlarge on them and thereby shall I both explain my self and make my application My primary contention at the moment is that the agricultural and rural subjects may be made a means of education used as socalled culture studies and that a knowl edge of them on the part of a large propor tion of the people in their general bearings is essential to training for citizenship They therefore become by right a part of the con tent of a school and of a college course If any institution essays to cover the field f higher education and is free to do so under the terms of its charter or of its state rela tions then agriculture can not be omitted Of course no institution should admit agri culture into its curriculum until it is ready for the subject and can provide the neces sary support any more than it should admit Greek or economics until it is ready for the subject To be ready for agriculture re 3 The Training of Farmers p 225 1909 4 The State and the Farmer p 166 1908 quires much more than equipment and ade quate funds the institution in its govern ing body and in its faculty should come to the subject on the same educational basis as it comes to any other subject prepared to give it opportunity and sympathetic con sideration and to make it in fact a worthy coordinate with other departments The agricultural work of which I here speak is to be a contribution to other courses and departments in a university It might very well be a department in an arts course Unfortunately we think of agriculture in higher institutions of learning only as a very highly developed series of technical courses maintained mostly on a semipro fessional basis This is properly the devel opment in the landgrant colleges of agri culture and in them although the differen tiation has gone very far it will go still farther for we must bring our rural situa tion up to its proper level But in general and liberalarts endowed universities agri culture of another species may well be in troduced comparable with a department of a college rather than with a college entity itself It need not provide a course in agriculture  in the sense of a complete cur riculum by itself and it would not give a degree in agriculture We can not expect all students desiring agriculture as part of a liberal education to matriculate in a col lege of agriculture The content of such teaching of agricul ture would probably run strongly along the lines of the socalled humanitiesalong economics without being the customary economics along civics without being the usual civics along ethics without being speculative ethics and always be founded on good sources of technical information touching the nature and processes of pro duction the values in rural life knowledge of agricultural conditions with frequent visits in rural communities and excursions SCIENCE 81N S VOL XLIII No 1099 for special studies Such an organization for agriculture would not need the exten sive equipment of a college of agriculture and not even a farm It will be observed that I speak of agri culture for endowed universities and col leges that are supposed to cover the field of liberal education Whether agriculture of any kind should be taught in a state univer sity in a commonwealth in which the land grant college is separate is a question of state policy By the act of separating the institutions the state practically sets boundaries to the university as well as to the landgrant college it always remains then as I have already intimated for the state itself clearly to define the pur poses and the functions It is likewise a question of policy internal in this case as to whether even in a university carrying the landgrant work there should also be an arts course in agriculture I am convinced that we greatly need such departments of agriculture as are here sug gested The institutions need it on their own account and we need it for the cause of education and to train our people for selfgovernment There is no such profes sorship of agriculture as this so far as I know in this country The institutions are missing an opportunity My impression is that a firstclass depart ment of agriculture in a firstclass univer sity with a living man at the head of it who has had nakedhand experience on the farm would exercise a kind of influence in the subject and on the country that is now un visioned although much needed I suspect that the judgment of such a department would have unusual weight with the public being perhaps nonprofessional and free of propaganda and of governmental policies I foresee students going from such teaching to the colleges of agriculture for more de tailed and technical work and I think I foresee certain students going to such a de partment for reflective graduate study and for the privilege of acquaintance with a teacher who is not buried in organization The oldtime college professor giving himself personally to his students with few assistants provided a type of leadership and of influence of the highest value he lived the life he was content in his work To this man add something of the activity of the working world but without admini stration of great schemes and without a maze of paralyzing reports returns and projects and you have your perfect teacher This teacher would be in position to maintain poise He need not be afraid of deliberation He would be greatly satisfied to watch the procession go by We need a certain number of these men who are not only good students but who are so detached from plans and managements that they can keep our philosophy straight THE CHECK PLOTS We very well know that we need outside enterprises and influences to correct the tendencies of government Education and research in agriculture are tied up with governmental procedure I would not have you think that I am op posed to governmental supervision I do not even raise the question of the advisa bility or the merits of enactments or pol icies although ready to review the tenden cies in certain practises and I wish dis tinctly to give my voice for the meeting of the laws to their full and in a wholehearted way Regard for law and authority is as much a safeguard of a free people as is the necessity for individual action I am not implying that things are going bad with us or that any of the agricultural enter prise is suffering On the contrary I think that our governmental work in agriculture 82 SCIENCEJANUARY 21 1916 is on the whole particularly good I know many of the men in this line of govern mental oversightt and how capable they are I know that we must have regularized pro cedure and good organization It is said that for the greater nulmber of persons close supervision is necessary to which we all agree and yet it is surprising how quickly these persons respond to leader ship I know on the other hand that it is pos sible for governments or methods suggested by governmental necessities to invade edu cational work where they are not needed I fear that the days of much freedom and spontaneity in the work are more behind us than ahead of us We naturally extend a method or a way of procedure throughout a system as if uniformity were in itself an asset The very expansiveness of the enter prises the extent of funds involved the vast size of the country the numbers of students the alertness of the people for solutions all demand a complex method of administration and tend to immerse a man in the system I do not see how it can be avoided All the more is the necessity therefore for opportunities to those per sons who wish to do a personal work and to express themselvesjust themselvesin the doing it All the more do we need the example of institutions which have policies wholly their own to safeguard any future danger of too much regulation in the gov ernmental side One set would prove a powerful stimulus to the other as well as to exercise a natural control I hope there will never be any need of outside suggestion to restrain persons in the public institu tions who aspire to be governors congress men and the like who may be tempted to use their opportunities to that end and who are thereby out of place in college and science work As the public work becomes more crys tallized and more official as is of course inevitable the colleges of agriculture will begin to lose their boldest men We know that many men in government like to es cape to institutions as to universities will they desire also in time to escape the in stitutions  You must not think that I am here sum moning the bogyman of politics as a discouragement to institutions supported by the state Quite the contrary I have seen something of institutions I fear the entrance of politics as much into the governance of other institutions as of state institutions and perhaps even more so seeing that it is not answerable to public correction We are moving rather rapidly in these days away from starchamber deals and partizan control and upheavals But there remains the more dangerous because the more insidious formalizing of the daily work regulating of hours deadly conform ing of editorial offices employing of too many clerks and intermediaries the grad ual tying of the hands without any inten tion whatever that it shall be so the piling up of paper duties That is to say the old time fear of politics has now been super seded by the actual danger of impersonal interference in details and of machine rou tine I am not so much afraid of poli tics as I am of the deadlevels The old separatism in agriculture is breaking up The human forces are re shaping New crystallizations are taking place before our eyes rapidly Many plans of cooperation and coaction small and large are much recommended Now is the time to be careful that our rural life shall not be machinemade and overorganized THE FIELD FOR PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS The landgrant colleges of agriculture are not to expect to hold exclusively the en tire field of agricultureeducation of the SCIENCE 83N  VoL XLIII No 1099 higher grade nor is it desirable that they should do so They do not necessarily rep resent the last word in this field of public service We must soon begin to think of another range Private philanthropy will find this in viting and useful field Universities of many kinds will enter it as of their own domain The landgrant institutions will not lose their influence and standing on the contrary they ought to begin to pro duce the leaders for the other develop ment and specially must they be prepared to accept the other institutions when those institutions are really ready and worthy and give them encouragement and in par ticular must they not sit as censors These new developments being foreseen and I think inevitable then a modus vivendi must be found in advance The first de sirability as I have suggested is an atti tude of encouragement for all good effort in teaching and research the next essential is a willingness on the part of the land grant institutions to divide the field or at least to share it so far as they can do so and not surrender their legal or necessary rights or curtail their usefulness No one would want these institutions restricted in fact this must not be since they have been set aside to do a great work in a democracy The other institutions those not teaching agriculture on the landgrant basis should recognize that the publicmaintained col leges are now established in their field that this field belongs to them by law that these colleges are doing their work nobly and that the people will resent interference and they must remember the fine disdain in which the colleges of agriculture have been held in times past These other institu tions should not attempt to duplicate the work and equipment of the landgrant col leges they should enter fields of their own The effort to secure state support for such institutions is a perversion it introduces the very element of competition and con flict that it is so necessary to avoid and the institutions also thereby lose their special opportunity Neither will these institu tions if they are wise enter the field to se cure advertisement for any university or any body counting on the rising interest in agriculture the landgrant colleges are fortunately too strong for such a purpose to gain much headway What these fields are for the nonland grant endowed institutions may not be easy to forecast in detail but if the insti tutions desire to find such a field the dan ger of duplication conflict and hostility will thereby be avoided In fact these other institutions can never acquire the place they ought to find and which they have a right to enter by any movement of attack or of imitation The example of the untrammeled spirit which they ought to contribute to governmental enterprises must of course be born in freedom and in great good will Already have we discussed the opportu nity in a liberalarts college or in a univer sity for a department of agriculture We may now consider what an endowed institu tion established separately in the agricul tural field including horticulture forestry and other rural work may undertake There is opportunity and need in abun dance in the trainingschool field but we are not now considering this range In the college and university range it is probably not worth the while to undertake a new effort to make farmers although this particular fallacy seems to be very attrac tive to many men 1 If the hypothetical institution is to engage in research it had better not at tempt to cover the field of agriculture as the colleges of agriculture are obliged to cover it in order to answer the needs of the commonwealth it had better confine it self to a problem or a set of closely related 84 SCIENCEJANUARY 21 1916 problems organizing carefully for the effort equipping to the highest securing the best investigators regardless of the salary cost and allowing them to give them selves unreservedly to the research with out extension work or propaganda This kind of intensive investigation longcon tinued patiently pursued not depending for support on popular will not interfered with by endless extraneous records and reports of progress not obliged to demon strate the necessity for its existence would have a farreaching influence for good 2 If the institution is designed only to enter extension work in agriculture it had better cease before it begins The public forces are already at the command of the national cooperative extension enter prises these enterprises are founded on good investigational work and on the ac cumulation of experience in the regularly established institutions Extension work should never be projected in vacuo 3 If it is in teaching of the higher grade that the new separate institution would ex press itself then it must find its place if at all by sheer commanding excellence It will compete first of all with the landgrant college of its own state if it is of compar able grade and with similar institutions in fortyseven other states not to mention those in the provinces of Canada this will present at once a difficult situation If it is of inferior grade then it must recognize its place and not attempt to give a degree in agriculture or otherwise to bring the educational standards in this new field now being attained with much hard effort into disrepute I can imagine a very worthy private foundation on college and even on university grade making its way continuously and successfully but I should expect it to make best headway if it spe cialized rather than attempted to cover the whole field the expense in staff and equip ment to occupy the entire field would be very heavy and it is doubtful whether the extra expenditure at this epoch would be socially justifiable This particular com plete range or organization of college teach ing seems to be peculiarly the province of the state to support and the state is al ready deeply engaged in the enterprise By combining good agricultural work of a restricted kind with other naturework not eliminating other cultural studies an en dowed institution could make for itself a very useful place 4 Long have I felt that a new kind of institution for agriculture of very high grade will some day arise on private en dowment This will be a coordinating and leadership institution teaching advanced and special students in some subjects en gaging in research but in the main making its contribution as a place for conference for consideration of the large civic and social relations of rural life and as a volun tary meetingplace on common and neutral ground for all the forces that lie in the situation The state colleges of agriculture are coordinate with each other they draw support from the same classes of funds they come to have a comity of equality they are all restricted in their outlook or at least in their practise by their necessary connections We may be sure that there are bounds beyond which they may not go in making opinion on certain lines of great public questions Government can not lead them it can only supervise and regu late them I think I see the necessity for better op portunities than the landgrant or other statemaintained institutions are likely to give the freest men Where shall we place our prophets Separately they may ac complish much but backed by facilities and a broad institution they may accomplish much more One institution founded with SCIENCE 85N S VOL XLIII No 1099 sympathy and on statesmanship could oc cupy a great place if any board of gov ernors were wise enough to avoid the cranks It certainly would avoid all red tape and all routinemen and all perplexing alliances We may well look to govern ment to coordinate the fiscal business and to some extent the projects of the public in stitutions but we can not expect it to bring together the spiritual elements that alone can make a movement or a people great Spiritual forces are always spontaneous I want to see at least one broad founda tion separately placed certainly not in Washington highly endowed that will at tract the best spirits somewhat independ ently of the subjects that they teach to enable these men and women to give of themselves in a composite faculty and to represent the best leadership in statecraft and other subjects as related to agriculture and country life We are so accustomed to the formally regular program of the exist ing college of agriculture that an outline like this may seem to be indefinite and to lack cohesion but it is not so very differ ent from the old idea of a university in fact it might be known as a university founded on the earth on rural life with its students mostly graduates and not very numerous with a good naturebackground and not topheavy with technical equip ment THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER My presentation is of four motives 1 To extend the rural teaching founded on agriculture into general and liberal arts in stitutions to the end that it may be made a means of culture a force for training in citizenship and a broadening influence in the institutions 2 to indicate a way in which private endowments or enterprises of college and university grade may be hope fully made in agriculture 3 to suggest the need of nongovernmental movements which shall introduce into this field the same balance and counterbalance of forces that is essential in other fields for the main tenance of government that arises from the people for not even in a democracy should all education be statemaintained 4 to conserve the independence and the oppor tunities of the boldest prophets Of these motives the last one I consider to be much the most important the neces sity to provide a footing for at least a few men without official attachments of supe rior qualifications and with an outlook cov ering the entire field The historian will discover this present segment of time to have been remarkable for its attainments with the products in agri culture It is an epoch of wonderful horses recordbreaking cows magnificent bulls im peccable fowls an epoch of marvellous fruits of the land and of vast projects of reclamation But the temper of the time begins to run out to the human factors to the worth of the people in all the localities to the little movements here and there that arise like springs in a fertile field We just begin to glimpse something beyond us as yet undefined and presently our thought will begin to run backward to discover who were the men far in the generations behind us who saw something of this field and what they said about it and what have been the rills of influence that have made the present current We shall look forward for lead ers and shall discover that although we have had major prophets not yet have we had a national figure n        I Such questions as these that we have raised and many more of wide reach must be discussed somewhere before representa tive gatherings Shall it be here or else where This company comprises members of the Association and adherents of Section 86 SCIENCEJANUARY 21 1916 M What shall be the field and the func tion of this body Shall it be strictly pro fessional and official  Or shall it represent our democratic spirit and our forecast in troducing the element of public policy and prophecy even into technical discussion bringing together the men and women from all sides and expressing all the work and movements  Our work is well under way The morning hours are passed and the day is well toward noon L H BAILEY UNIVERSITY REGISTRATION STATISTICS THE registration returns for November 1 1915 of thirty of the universities of the country will be found tabulated on a following page These statistics show only the registra tion in the universities considered There is no intention to convey the idea that these uni versities are the thirty largest universities in the country nor that they are necessarily the leading institutions The largest gains in terms of student units including the summer attendance but making due allowance by deduction for the summer session students who returned for instruction in the fall are registered by California 2375 Pennsylvania 900 Minnesota 892 Chicago 837 Columbia 594 and Pittsburgh 594 New York University 514 Ohio State 508 Illinois 486 Missouri 483 Cornell 412 Iowa State 370 Michigan 365 Northwestern 336 Cincinnati 334 West ern Reserve 302 The University of California shows a large gain of 2375 students no other institution shows a gain of more than 1000 as against four last year However sixteen institu tions listed above show gains of more than 300 as against fourteen last year and ten the year before The fourteen institutions last year were Columbia California Pittsburgh Ohio State Wisconsin Harvard New York University Minnesota Pennsylvania Illi nois Nebraska Cornell Cincinnati and Michigan Of these Wisconsin Harvard and Nebraska are not included this year in the group and Chicago Missouri Iowa State Northwestern and Western Reserve are in cluded this year but were not last year Four institutions as against one last year show decreases in grand total attendance They are Tulane Washington University Harvard and Princeton Exclusive of sum mer sessions Western Reserve and Wisconsin show decreases Washington University and Princeton not having summer sessions Omitting the enrollments in the summer session the universities showing the largest gains for 1915 are Pennsylvania 916 Minne sota 739 Pittsburgh 594 Ohio State

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107357,ON AN EBBING AND FLOWING STREAM DISCOVERED BY BORING IN THE HARBOUR OF BRIDLINGTON,I206970,C 54 3 IV ON AN EBBING AND FOWINGSTREAM DISCOVERED BY BORING IN THE HARBOUR OF BRIDLINGTON BY JOHN STORER M D COMMUNI CATED BY THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART K B P R S READ JANUARY 19 1815 THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF CERTAIN PECULIARITIES ATTENDING A SPRING OF FRESH WATER WHICH WAS TAPPED IN BORING WITHIN THE HARBOUR OF BRIDLINGTON QUAY YORKSHIRE IS GIVEN FROM RE PEATED OBSERVATIONS MADE DURING A RESIDENCE OF SOME WEEKS THERE IN THE MONTHS OF JULY AND AUGUST 1814 THE HARBOUR OF BRIDLINGTON QUAY IS DRY AT LOW WATER EXCEPT FOR A RIVULET WHICH TRAVERSES ITS BED AT HIGH WATER IT HAS FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN FEET OF WATER MR RENNIE CIVIL ENGINEER WAS CONSULTED IN THE YEAR 1811 RESPECTING CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS PROJECTED IN THAT HARBOUR AT HIS DESIRE WITH A VIEW TO ASCERTAIN THE DEPTH OF THE STRA TUM OF CLAY IN THE HARBOUR THE BORING WHICH TERMINATED IN FORMING THE WELL TO BE DESCRIBED WAS BEGUN UNDER THE DIREC TION OF MR MILNE COLLECTOR OF THE CUSTOMS FOR THE PORT THE SPOT FIXED UPON IS OPPOSITE TO THE TERMINATION OF A STREET LEAD ING TO THE HARBOUR AND HAS ABOUT SIX FEET OF WATER AT HIGH WATER IN ORDINARY TIDES AFTER THE WORKMEN HAD BORED THROUGH TWENTYEIGHT FEET OF VERY SOLID CLAY AND AFTERWARDS THROUGH FIFTEEN FEET OF A CRETA CEOUS FLINTY GRAVEL OF A VERY CONCRETE TEXTURE THE AUGER WAS PERCEIVED TO STRIKE AGAINST THE SOLID ROCK BUT AS THEY WERE NOTEBBING ANDFLOWING STREAM AT BRIDLINGTON 55 ABLE TO MAKE ANY IMPRESSION UPON IT THE WORK WAS GIVEN UP FOR THAT TIDE WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF WATER FROM THE FIRST IN AN HOUR OR TWO AFTERWARDS THE BORE WAS FOUND FILLED TO THE TOP WITH FRESH WATER OF THE MOST LIMPID APPEARANCE IT SOON FLOWED OVER AND WAS EVEN PROJECTED SOME INCHES ABOVE THE SUMMIT OF THE BORE IN A STREAM EQUAL TO ITS CALIBRE WHEN IT WAS ASCERTAINED THAT THE WATER WAS OF THE PUREST QUALITY AND TASTE PERFECTLY FIT FOR WASHING AND EVERY CULINARY PURPOSE THE BORE WAS PROPERLY SECURED BY AN ELM STOCK TEN FEET LONG AND PERFORATED WITH A THREE INCH AUGER DRIVEN TO ITS FULL LENGTH A COPPER TUBE WELL TINNED ON BOTH SIDES OF A CIRCUMFERENCE TO ADMIT ITS BEING PASSED THROUGH THE BORE OF ELM STOCK AND THIRTYTWO FEET IN LENGTH WAS THEN FORCED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BORE SO AS TO REST ON THE ROCK THE UPPER PART BEING PROPERLY PUDDLED ROUND THE ELM STOCK AND THE WELL THUS COMPLETED THE FOLLOWING SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCES WERE OB SERVED AND HAVE CONTINUED WITH GREAT UNIFORMITY EVER SINCE AS SOON AS THE SURFACE OF THE SEA WATER IN THE HARBOUR DURING THE FLOWING TIDE HAS ARRIVED AT A LEVEL OF FORTYNINE OR FIFTY INCHES LOWER THAN THE TOP OF THE BORE THE WATER BEGINS TO FLOW FROM IT IN A STREAM EQUAL TO ITS CALIBRE THE IMPETUS OF WHICH IS INCREASED AS THE TIDE ADVANCES AND MAY BE OB SERVED TO BE PROPELLED WITH MUCH FORCE AFTER THE BORE IS OVERFLOWED BY THE TIDE THE DISCHARGE CONTINUES FROM FOUR TO FIVE HOURS I E TILL THE TIDE IN RETURNING FALLS TO THE SAME LEVEL WHERE IT BEGAN TO FLOW AT THIS POINT IT CEASES COMPLETELY TILL THE NEXT FLOOD SHALL HAVE REGAINED THE SAME LEVEL WHEN THE SAME PHENOMENA RECUR IN THE SAME SUCCESSION AND WITH OUT ANY VARIATION BUT WHAT ARISES FROM THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF ELEVATION IN THE TIDES THE RULE APPEARS TO BE THAT THEDR STORERS ACCOUNT OF AN COLUMN OF SPRING WATER IN THE BORE IS ALWAYS SUPPORTED AT A HEIGHT OF FORTYNINE OR FIFTY INCHES ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE TIDE AT ANY GIVEN TIME THIS AT LEAST WAS THE RESULT OF EVERY OB SERVATION I MADE DURING SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE WEEKS IN THE MONTHS OF JULY AND AUGUST LAST AND I AM ASSURED BY MR MILNE ON WHOSE INGENUITY AND HABIT OF ACCURATE OBSERVATION I CAN PLACE THE FIRMEST RELIANCE THAT HIS HABITUAL EXPERIENCE FOR THREE YEARS PAST GOES TO CONVINCE HIM THAT THE VARIATIONS FROM THE RULE STATED ABOVE ARE VERY INCONSIDERABLE DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMNAL MONTHS BUT THAT IN WINTER AFTER ANY UNUSUAL FALL OF RAIN HE HAS KNOWN THE COLUMN OF FRESH WATER RAISEL EIGHT FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE TIDE AND THE PERIOD OF ITS DISCHARGE PROPORTIONALLY PROLONGED FOR THE USE OF THE TOWN AND SHIPPING A RESERVOIR OF BRICK WORK CAPABLE OF CONTAINING ONE THOUSAND GALLONS HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITHIN TWO OR THREE YARDS AND UPON SOMEWHAT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE SUMMIT OF THE BORE AND IS MADE TO COMMUNICATE WITH IT BY A TUBE OF THE SAME DIAMETER FITTED WITH A VALVE TO PREVENT ANY REFLUX INTO THE WELL TWO WASTE PIPES ARE PLACED WITHIN A FOOT OF THE TOP OF THE RESERVOIR FOR THE REGULAR DISCHARGE OF THE WATER AND IT HAS ALSO BEEN MADE TO COMMUNICATE WITH A PUMP ADJOINING BY WHICH THE RESER VOIR MAY BE EMPTIED AND AS THE BORE OF THE WELL IS NOW CLOSED AND SECURED AT THE TOP IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE COM MENCEMENT OF THE FLOW OF WATER FROM THE PIPES OF THE RE SERVOIR WILL HAPPEN A FEW MINUTES SOONER OR LATER AT EACH TIDE ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITY OF WATER IT CONTAINED AT THE TIME SUCH HOWEVER IS THE KNOWN REGULARITY OF THE DIS CHARGE FROM THE WASTE PIPES THAT AT THE EXPECTED TIME OF THE TIDE SEVERAL OF THE INHABITANTS ARE ALWAYS ON THE SPOT WITH 56EBBING ANDFLOWING STREAM AT BRIDLINGTON THEIR VESSELS AND ARE RARELY OBLIGED TO WAIT FOR MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES SUCH IS THE STATE OF FACTS AND IT APPEARS TO OPEN A SUBJECT OF CURIOUS INVESTIGATION TO THOSE WHOSE HABITS AND PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE QUALIFY THEM FOR IT THE APPEARANCES SEEM NOT TOADMIT OF ANY SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION WITHOUT SUPPOSING SOME MODE OF SUBTERRANEAN COMMUNICATION BY WHICH THE WATER OF THE SEA AND THAT OF THE SPRING IN QUESTION ARE BROUGHT INTO ACTUAL CONTACT SO AS TO EXERT A RECIPROCAL ACTION THIS SUPPOSITION RECEIVES CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FROM A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH I HAD NO OPPORTMUITY TO OBSERVE BUT WHICH MR MILNE HAS HAD FREQUENT OCCASION TO NOTICE AND WHICH HE DESCRIBES BY REMARKING THAT AFTER STORMY WEATHER WHEN THERE IS A HEAVY SEA ON THAT COAST THE WATER IS DISCHARGED EVEN FROM THE WASTE PIPES OF THE RESERVOIR WITH AN EVIDENT UNDULATION WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE MORE CONSIDERABLE FROM THE ORIGI NAL BORE MR MILNE HAS FRAMED AN HYPOTHESIS TO SATISFY HIS OWN MIND ON THIS CURIOUS SUBJECT HE BELIEVES THE STRATUM OF CLAY FOUND IN THE HARBOUR TO EXTEND OVER THE WHOLE BAY IN FRONT OF IT AS FAR AS THE SMITHWICK SAND WHICH FORMS A BAR ACROSS THE OPENING OF THE BAY IN A DIRECTION FROM FLAMBOROUGH HEAD TOWARDS THE SPURN POINT AND ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM THE QUAY IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION THIS BANK IS SUPPORTED BY A REEF OF ROCK AND THOUGH THERE ARE OPENINGS WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN AND ADMIT VESSELS OF CONSIDERABLE BURDEN AT ALL TIMES OF THE TIDE THERE IS IN GENERAL BUT A SMALL DRAFT OF WATER ON THIS BANK WHEN THE TIDE IS OUT ON THE OUTWARD OR EAST SIDE TOWARDS THE OCEAN THE ROCK IS QUITE PERPENDICULAR AND A GREAT DEPTH OF WATER IS IMMEDIATELY BEHIND IT AS THE COPIOUS SOURCE MDCCCXV I 57DR STORERS ACCOUNT OF AN OF WATER WHICH HAS BEEN TAPPED IN THE HARBOUR LIES AT SUCH A DEPTH AND UNDER A STRATUM OF CLAY THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT IT CAN BE DISCHARGED ANY WHERE IN THE BAY TILL IT ARRIVES AT THE LEDGE OF ROCK WHERE THE CLAY TERMINATES HERE AMONG THE FISSURES OF THE ROCK IT MAY FIND ITS EXIT AND THIS IS THE MORE LIKELY AS IT IS KNOWN THAT THE BED OF THE SEA AT THE BACK OF THE SMITHWICK SAND IS AT SO MUCH A LOWER LEVEL ADMITTING THIS SUPPOSITION TO BE CORRECT OR NEARLY SO IT SEEMS TO FOLLOW THAT THE ISSUE OF A BODY OF FRESH WATER THROUGH A FISSURE IN ROCK FORMING THE BED OF THE SEA WOULD MEET WITH MORE OR LESS RESISTANCE AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE TIDE BECAUSE THE TWO COLUMNS OF FLUID IN MEETING WOULD ACT UPON ONE ANOTHER IN THE RATIO OF THE ALTITUDE OF EACH TAKING INTO THE ACCOUNT THE DIFFERENCE OF THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND THUS IF THERE IS ANY APPROACH TO AN EQUILIBRIUM AN OPERATION WOULD RESULT ANALOGOUS TO THE FLUX AND REFLUX OF THE TIDE NEAR THE MOUTH OF RIVERS THIS HYPOTHESIS IS SPECIOUS AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE FLUX AND REFLUX OF THE WATER FROM THE BORE AS WELL AS FOR THE SINGULAR UNDULATION OF THE DISCHARGE IN A BOISTEROUS STATE OF THE SEA BUT THE GREATER RELATIVE ALTITUDE TO WHICH THE COLUMN OF SPRING WATER IS ELEVATED AFTER MUCH RAIN AND THE CONSEQUENT PRO LONGED DISCHARGE OF IT DURING EACH TIDE SEEMS TO MILITATE AGAINST ITS CORRECTNESS SINCE IN A CASE WHERE BY THE SUPPO SITION A BALANCE IS NEARLY ESTABLISHED AN ADDITIONAL IMPETUS COMMUNICATED TO THE COLUMN OF SPRING WATER OUGHT TO PRO DUCE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT BY ENABLING IT TO OVERCOME THE RE SISTANCE OF THE SAME COLUMN OF SEA WATER DURING A LONGER PERIOD OF EACH TIDE THAN UNDER THE USUAL CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT THIS WHOLE SUBJECT MIGHT BE 58EBBING AND FLOWING STREAM AT BRIDLINGTON ELUCIDATED BY A MORE PERFECT ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PECU LIARITIES OF THE SPRINGS ON THIS PART OF THE COAST PROVINCIALLY TERMED GIPSIES THE WATER IN THIS DISTRICT OF THE EAST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE POSSESSES THAT LIMPIDNESS WHICH IS USUAL IN CRE TACEOUS SOILS BUT FOR MANY MILES OF THE WOLDS BELIND BRID LINGTON VERY LITTLE WATER IS TO BE SEEN THERE ARE FEW RIVULETS AND THESE ARE VERY LOW IN THE SUMMER AND MOST OF THEM QUITE DRY IN AUTUMN THE ACCOUNT TO BE COLLECTED FROM THE INHABITANTS IS THAT IN TWO OR THREE WEEKS AFTER THE COMMENCE MENT OF FROST THE SPRINGS BEGIN TO RUN COPIOUSLY AND IN MANY THE WATER IS PROJECTED WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY AS TO RESEMBLE A JET DEAU IT IS THEN THAT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY IT IS SAID THE GIPSIES ARE UP AND THE RIVULETS OVERFLOW JOHN STORER NOTTINGHAM NOV 5 1814 DRAWN UP FROM NOTES TAKEN AT THE TIME AND ON THE

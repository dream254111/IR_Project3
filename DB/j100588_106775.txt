I POURED THE POWDER INTO THE FLASK THROUGH A FUNNEL WHICH REACHED TO THE LOTTOMS SO THAT NORLE OF IT MIGHT BE LODGED ON THE SIDES IOR9 NOT HAVING ATTENDED TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE BEFORE   I WAS APPREHENSIVE THAT THE EXPERILMENT WAS DELUSIVE AND THAT THE AGITATION OF THE HOT OIL MIGHT HAVE WASHED DOWN SOME FRESH PARTICLES WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BEFORE HEATED THEN SLOWLY POURING IIL A LITTLE OIL I BOILED IT FOR A FEW MINUTESV AND REMOVED IT INTO A DARK PLACE WHEN THE POWDER HAD BECOME BUT FAINTLY LUMINOUS UPON AGITATION THE EXPERIMENT SLLCCEEDED EXACTLY I THEN BOILED AND ATITATED THE OIL FOR SIX OR SEVEN TIMES SUCCESSIVELY9 WITH THE SAME RESULTX EXCEPT THAT THE LIGHT OF THE POWDER GREW SOMETHING FAINTER EACH TIME IF ANY ONE HAS THE CURIOSITY TO REPEAT THIS SINGULAR EXPERIMENT HE MAY ATTEND TO THE FOLLOWING DIRECTIONSUPON EACH REMOVAL FROM THE FRE STOP THE NECK OF THE FLASK WITH A CORK9 HAVING A SMALL HOLE PIERCED THROUGH IT WRAP THE NECK ROUND WITH TOMRAGITATE THE LIQUOR BY QUICKLY RAISING AND LOWERING THE RASK THE SPARKS WHICH LEAVE THE SURFACES OF HARD BODIES DURING ATTRITIOIL MAY BE EXACTLY XMITATED BY LZLLRNING A BIT OF DUSTY PAPER THE PARTICLES OF DUST ARE CARRIED BY THE CUR RCILT OF AIR THROUGH THE BLAZE AND ARE MADE RED HOT IN THEIR PASSAGE

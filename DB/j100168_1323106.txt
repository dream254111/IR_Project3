are estopped from instituting such proceedings Lowenstein v Henry McShane Mfg Co 12 Am B Rep 6oi U S Dist Ct Dist of Md As there is no precedent exactly in point the court reasons from the rather doubtful analogy that onie who assents to an assigniment for the benefit of creditors is estopped from later setting it up as an act of banikruptcy Zn re Romnanow 92 Fed Rep 5io Simons v Sinscheimer 95 Fed Rep 948 The reasoning of these cases proceeds uponl the ground that the creditor having alreadv agreed to one method of distribution of his debtors property cannot afterwards file a petition which would be virtually repudiating his forimier position But the duty of a receiver is not necessarily like that of an assignee to wind up and distribute the debtors estate it is primarily to preserve the property and to carry on the business under the direction of the court Since the receiver may not conduct the enterprise as satisfactorily as anticipated it necessarily follows that a concurrence in his appointment is perfectly consistent with a later desire to have bankruptcy proceedings inistituted It would seem therefore that the petitioner could hardly be disqualified by such concurrence BANKRUPTCY PRIORITY OF CLAIMS  RIGHT OF PARTNERSHIP CREDITORS TO SHARE IN INDIVIDUAL ESTATE A partnership of wlhich a bankrupt had been a member was insolvent and had no solvent members

some such presumption is necessary for the protectioni of the public It is no hardship on the carriers for if they deem it expe dient they can exact from one another receipts fixing the responsibility

The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur rests upon commnon sense and the propriety of presuininig the defendants negligence should depend on1 the facts of the particular case Whether its basis be mere expediency probability or the defendanits peculiar knowledge of the facts the present case seems to warrant its application The rule has apparently made headway against the pre sumption favoring

squarely rejecting this doctrine refuses to apply it to a case where the statement does not expressly declare the alleged initention but merely implies it The soundniess of this decision seems doubtful for once admitting that the initenition is a relevant fact anid that it may be proved by evidence of declarations it is difficult to see why a statement should not be admitted which under the

the estate when he was at all times insolvent Buckel v Smiths Administrator 82 S W Rep IOO0 Ky lThere is no statute in Kentucky affecting debts due the estate by the administrator At common law the appointment of the initestates debtor as administrator suspended action on the debt Ferebee v Doxey 6 Ired N C 448 But later the equitable presumption that what the law requires to be done has been done was invoked even in actions at law to make his own debt assets in the hanids of the administrator Crow v Conant 90 Mich 247 This fiction of payment has been applied to charge the surety on the administration bond with the full amount of the debt even though the debtor was insolvent when he became administrator Leland v Felton r Allen Mass 531 Since this presumption is an equitable one however it should be limited by considerations of fairness The surety of the administrator did guarantee an honest administration but he never contemplated becoming in effect a surety for past obligations and to permit the estate to profit at his expense by the interposition of a legal fiction seems manifestly unjust See McCarty v Frazier 62 Mo 263 EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS  PROCEEDINGS BY OR AGAINST  RIGHI TO APPEAL FROM DECISION IN FAVOR OF LEGATEE  BY an express stipulation in a will any beneficiary contesting it was to forfeit his interest thereby The executrix claimed that the

party aggrieved cannot have this question decided on appeal In re Murphys Estate 78 Pac Rep 960 Cal Whenever obedience to the order of the probate court would subject the executor to liability it is clear that he is an interested party having the right of appeal In re Welch IO6 Cal 427 Cheever v Washtenaw Circuzit Jud4ge 45 Mich 6 But where no persolnal liability exists it is questionable whether the executor alonie may appeal from an order of apportionment among the beneficiaries One group of decisions holds that the ex ecutor is a party in interest and that it is his right and duty to appeal from an order believed to be erroneous Ruch Administrator v Bieiy IIO Ind 444 A majority of the decisions however support the principal case Bryant v Thompsonl I28 N Y 426 Merrick v Kennedy 46 Neb 264 The executor certainly has an ilterest in securing a judicial determination of questions involving distribution of property but such interest should not necessarily extend to the enforcemelnt of his own precon ceived views especially if the expenses of litigation rest upon the estate Othervise the funds intended for one beneficiary would be used in fighting the battles of another It would seem therefore that in a controversy between the legatees the right of appeal should be left with them alone FIXTURES  WHETHER ELECTRIC CARS ARE FIXTURES Under a statute author izing the taxation of real

of the fact that the cars of one company are con stantly being hauled over the lines of others It would appear that the decision in the case of electric railways should be the same An effort has been made however to draw a distinction upon the grounid that owing to the mode of operation by means of a continuious current of electricity passing frorn the wires through the cars and rails back to the generator the cars are but parts of one great machine which is affixed to the realty by means of its rails and power house Bank of Montreal v Kirkpatrick 2 Ont L Rep 113 This reasoning seems fanciful

principal case therefore seems sound Although the statute gives a wife a new right to the profits of property acquired by her before and during coverture this is not conclusive It gives her to be sure full conitrol over what was already her own but the essential nature of an estate by the entirety is that the wife has nlo present interest durinlg coverture and the statute does not purport to

necessary to give a right to distrain Preece v Corrie 5 Bing 24 Consequently in the principal case the defendants lease to the plaintiff operated as an assignment and unless he acquired a reversionary interest through the agreement of the lessor to grant him the subsequent lease he lost his right to distrain But a mere agreement to grant a lease gives no legal interest whatever Phillips v Hartley 3

invitation of the owner on ordinary business are entitled to be protected against the unsafe condition of the premises Indermaur v Damies L R I C P 274 Four courts have held that a fireman who enters property to extiliguish a fire is not entitled to such protection Cf Beehler v Daniels cc Co I8 R I 563 These courts seem to consider that the predominant purpose of such an entry is to prevent the spread of the flames rather than to protect the property of the owner Furthernmore since firemen are often authorized by statute to enter any build ing to extinguish a fire courts are averse to implying an invitation to enter It seems that the function of a fireman is twofold to protect the owners property and to pre venit the spread of the flames The courts might have emphasized the first element anid have held that as his entry was benieficial to the owner he was an invited person But the hardship of compelling landowners always to keep their property in a safe con dition is a strong practical argument in favour of the presenit decision RAILROADS LIABILITY TO TRESPASSERTrRESPASSER ON TRAIN INJURED BY COLLISION The plaintiffs intestate was a brakeman on one of the defelndants two

Great Northern Ry Co 6I Minn 296 Although by the better view employees of a train are under a dtuty to ascertain the presence of trespassers on their tracks conisistently with the performance of their paramount duty to protect property transported courts very commonly deny that a similar duty is owed to adult trespassers on trains Gruaist v Chiicago etc Ry Co IO9 Mich 342 Cf Cincinnati etcA R R Co v Smzith 22 Oh St 227 A railroad does not owe to the latter class the duty of a carrier of passengers but that of a lanld ownier not to ilijure them by active negligence and the hazardous nature of railroad business raises a duty of care to discover trespassers the degree of which varies with398 HARVARD LAW REVIEW the probability of their presence As a question of fact however the presence of trespassers is not so notorious on trains as on tracks and the facts reported in the present case seem to show no neglect of the duty to anticipate the presence of the plaintiffs intestate The same decision would apparently follow also from the fellow servant doctritne Greer v Louisville etc R R Co 94 Ky I69 RECEIVERS  PENDENCY OF NUMEROUS ACTIONS AGAINST CORPORATION AS GROUND FOR APPOINTMENT The plaintiffs bill stated that over one hunldred and eighty people were killed by the negligence of the defenidant company that one hun dred and fifty suits for damages were pending against it and that since the plaintiffs suit was not among the first it was not probable that any assets would be left when their suit was decided They therefore prayed for the appointment of a receiver to preserve the property until the rights of all the creditors should be determined Held that a receiver will not be appointed Slover v Coal Creek Coal Co 82 S W Rep 1131 Tennl The power of equity to appoint a receiver has generally been exercised where the plaintiff has brought suit and there is danger that the defendant will wrongfully dis pose of his property before execution can be levied Vilax v Grand Island etc Co 97 N W Rep 613 Neb The principal case however does not fall within this class The plaintiffs did not ask for a receivership pendente lite but sought to impound the property till all the actions should be determinied Nor does it fall within that class of cases where the purpose is to wind up a corporation since such relief is not asked Finally it is not one of those exceptional instances in which the coturt interferes with the managemenit of a corporation by appointing a receiver when the assets are being wrongfully wasted Cozro v Gray 4 How Pr N Y t66 The bill therefore asked for no recogniized form of relief and the court seems justified in refusing to make an exception in this case Although the result reduces the plaintiffs chances of sharing in the assets the defenidants liability in the tort actionls is too conjectural to warrant virtually holding up its business pending their litigationi RES JUDICATAMATTERS CONCLUDEDMATTERS OF LAW A statute pro vided

Heyman v 7omas 32 Wash Law Rel 792 D C Statuites of setoff in most jutrisdictions are interpreted so as to allow such a setoff as was claimed here The conflict in the decisions seems to come from a difference of initerpretationi rather thani from aniy real distinctioni between the statutes though their wording often varies Inidiana with a statute allowing setoff of claims arisilng  out of debt

finid analogies to examine the decisions relating to negroes and Indians The former class of cases is of little aid being based mainly upon statutes providing that a persoil having onefourth or oneeighth negro blood shall be deemed of that race Other decisions regard the predominiating blood as determining the race Lane v Baker 12 Oh 237 And again in some jurisdictionis the distinction is made between negroes and colored persons of mixed blood Frasher v The State 3 Tex App 263 Decisions relating to Indians furnish a better analogy being free from statutory limitations Here it is

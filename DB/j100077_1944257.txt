on May 15 Mr Walter Long sec retary for the colonies in the Lloyd George administration was care ful to state that the bill was not a government measure It is the fourth reform bill since 1830 and the only bill dealing with the fran chise that can be described as an agreed billa measure to which the leaders of political parties had given their assent before it was sub mitted to parliament The act of 1832 it will be recalled was carried by a Whig administration against persistent opposition from the Con servatives A Conservative administration carried the act of 1867 through parliament but in the house of commons the Liberal opposi tion headed by Gladstone had a large part in moulding the form in which the bill went to the house of lords The Gladstone government of 18801885 carried the act of 1884 but had to make terms with the opposition as to the order in which the franchise and redistribution bills were proceeded with The new bill forced on parliament and the government by electoral exigencies growing out of the war is based on resolutions adopted at a conference presided over by the speaker Right Hon J W Lowther in which representatives of all parties in562 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW the house of commons took part The whole procedure preliminary to the bill was new in British parliamentary history Its only parallel would seem to be the procedure adopted at Ottawa since 1903 when the decennial redistribution bill is before the house of commons There in accordance with a praiseworthy innovation introduced by Sir Wilfrid Laurier when he was premier from 1896 to 1911 the redistribution bill is read a first time and then referred for settlement of boundaries of constituencies to a special committee whose members are nominated by both political parties This said Mr Long when under the ten minute rule he intro duced the bill of May 15 is not a government bill but the result of a conference at which all parties and all sections in this house were represented In its preparation the same rule has been followed inas much as the government committee which is responsible for turning the recommendations of the conference into the form of a bill was com posed of men representing many shades of political opinion It deals added Mr Long who introduced the bill in the absence through illness of Sir George Cave the home secretary with all the recom mendations of the conferencefranhise registration the conduct and cost of elections redistribution and other questions English newspapers to hand up to the day when this note was writ tenJune 5 1917contained reports only of the brief debate at first reading stage on May 15 and summaries of the bill By cable there has been news that at second reading the bill was carried by a large majoritynot more than forty members nearly all of them Conserva tives voting for the motion to reject on the ground that wartime was not an appropriate season for an extensive readjustment of the elec toral system The bill as introduced can well be described as a sweeping measure more radical and more comprehensive than the act of 1867 or 188485 In commenting on the simplification of the electoral code that will result from the bill Mr Long told the house that the bill repealed no fewer than thirtyone statutes dealing with the representative system and partly repealed thirtytwo more also concerned with the repre sentation And the whole law he added is brought into the bill which contains a little more than thirty clauses with schedules There were reports that we were shortening the bill by handing over every thing to be done by ordersincouncil There is no foundation for that statement Everything is within the four corners of the bill either in the clauses or in the schedulesNEWS AND NOTES 563 Only students of the representative system in England can ade quately realize the full meaning of Mr Longs statement that the elec toral code is to be embodied in an act of not more than thirty sections Since Englishmen first went to the polls to vote for members of the house of commons there never was until this bill of 1917 was intro duced even an attempt to embody all the electoral laws in a single act of parliament As regards actual changes in the representative system the most radical and farreaching is the admission of women to the franchise We include the enfranchisment of women says Mr Long on the lines indicated in Mr Speakers conference by a large majority We fix the age at which women shall be qualified to vote at thirty Another radical change is the abolition of the plural voter Heretofore there were men who from their ownership of free holds exercised at a general election as many as fifteen or twenty or even more votes Under the bill it will not be possible for any elec tor to cast more than two votes These votes will be based on occupa tion as distinct from possession which was the only qualification of the great majority of plural voters under the representative system as it had developed from the sixteenth century to the reform act of 1884 85 The great increase in the electorate under the new bill will come from 1 the inclusion of about 6000000 women and 2 the shorten ing of the qualifying period from a year to six months and the sim plification of registration procedure provided for in the bill Another quite noteworthy provision is that all elections shall take place on the same day There are also clauses determining the conditions under which absentees may record their votes EDWARD PORRITT

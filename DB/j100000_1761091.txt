Indians prevailed here namely the knees were drawn up against the breast and the corpse was buried face downward With the skeletons were found three ollas carved from crystallized talc which were used for cooking purposes two large sandstone mortars finely fin ished used for triturating grain and acorns a sand stone bowl about one inch deep and six inches in diameter two conical pipes and several large beads of serpentine several sheets of mica with hole drilled at the side  a broken tortilla stone several balls of paint and thousands of shell and glass beads wampum ornaments etc In a Haliotis shell H splendens I found eight old fashioned flat brass buttons with numerous specimens of wampum manufactured from Olivella biplicata The remains of a metal knife were discovered which with glass beads buttons and a portion of an oldfashioned waterbottle shows that this place was inhabited since the advent of the white man or within the past three hundred and fortythree years Probably the most interesting relic discovered was a metal fishhook It has a shank about four and a half centimetres in length with a point about three and a half centimetres long which from its shape I should judge was of Indian manufacture An Olivella shell was scalloped or notched leaving it somewhat in the shape of a crown The base was perforated and the shank of the hook pushed through it This was doubtless intended as an attraction to the fish The species is Olivella biplicata some of which are very white and at the end of a line would be nearly or quite equal in brilliancy to the pearl oystershell used by the SouthSea Islanders for the same purpose By the kindness of the publisher of Science an engraving of the fishhook is presented It is in a somewhat restored form the original being corroded to some extent by rust San Buenaventura Dec 8 STEPHEN BOWERS New find of fossil diatoms Seeing a reference to diatoms occurring in clay strata in a railroadcutting near Philadelphia in two of the recent issues of Science I wrote to Dr Koenig the discoverer for a sample of the diatom bearing clay I received the clay promptly and am delighted to be able to say that after a fiveminutes preparation I had the pleasure of noting a very rich slide containing at least thirty species of diatoms 35 the forms corresponding chiefly to the recent fresh water forms but characteristically different as relates to the association of the species when com pared with the forms occurring in the subpeat deposits of the eastern United States My reason for making this communication is that the value interest and importance of this new find of diatomaceous material has not been sufficiently emphasized in the two articles in Science and might be overlooked by diatomists and all who are on the constant lookout for new localities of fossil diatoms K M CUNNINGHAM Amoeboid movement of the cellnucleus The study of the cellnucleus has become a subject of such absorbing interest in biology that we feel justified in asking a little of your space to make known what seems to us a promising field for inves tigation During the last year in studying the blood of Necturus after its removal from the body and in the bloodvessels we were struck with the great size and distinctness of the nucleus of the white corpus cles But what seems especially interesting and important is the fact that the nucleus of the white bloodcorpuscles exhibits a very marked amoeboid movement both in the vessels of a curarized animal and on the microscopic slide These movements are as vigorous and easily followed as are those of the cellbody and often both the cellbody and nucleus are undergoing amoeboid movement at the same time the movements of the cellbody and nucleus seeming to be entirely independent of each other From the ease with which the white corpuscles are obtained and observed from the size and activity of the nucleus and its distinctness in the living condi tion it is confidently expected that the study of the white bloodcorpuscle of Necturus will greatly assist in making more definite our knowledge of the nu cleus its socalled membrane and the processes of its division S H and S P GAGE Anat lab Cornell univ Dec 25 English sparrows In Science Dec 18 appeared some remarks on the English sparrows that do not at all agree with our experience here We have many orchards and groves in and around our village Many of us have provided boxes for wrens martins bluebirds etc Robins cardinals crimsonbreasted grossbeaks cat birds etc are innumerable around us A few years ago some of our people accustomed to watch the many kinds of birds that frequent our court house grove asked me about a little bird that had just newly appeared in the grove They said that it was  driving all the other birds away Not content with merely fighting and mastery it drove the others clear out of the town The people had been watch ing them for some days and reported that half a dozen birds had actually made themselves the sole possessors of our melodious grove heretofore so delightfully noisy with the songs of the many native birds I suspected the cause and as soon as I saw the strange little birds pronounced them to be those winged rats the English sparrows For twenty years I had kept several boxes for martins at my own place About thirty pairs were making their homes at my doors Suddenly I missed them but the screech of a pair of English sparrows took JANUARY 8 188636 SCII their place Well we exterminated these sparrows and our birds came back C I Oregon Mo Jan 1 The discussion of the merits of the English sparrow as shown in the contributions to Science indicates a wide difference of opinion Some of the conclusions reached by your contributors are unwarranted by any facts based on a thorough knowledge of the birds habits as known in this country It is very convenient to join in the cry of enemy thief pest and like epithets but that is not a scientific method of reaching conclusions We want a bill of par ticulars more facts and less crusade against these assisted emigrants They are charged with driving out other birds from our city My home and place of observation being within twentyfive miles of New York City I can speak from careful observation that this charge has but little value in this locality Very few birds care to dwell in cities except in the suburbs It is neither congenial to their taste nor adapted to their requirements while the English sparrow is essentially a native of a city finding comfortable shelter and abundant food wherever partially digested grain may be found in stables or along the highways travelled by horses Excepting in the spring and summer months this waste ma terial is the almost exclusive food of this bird Now we will consider the country life of this spar row They are charged with destroying our crops Have the farmers of this country made this com plaint or must we echo the tirade from abroad  As a farmer my observation is that the amount of wheat this bird appropriates during the few days of harvesting is too insignificant for notice I know of no other grain that is molested in the slightest degree That they are large destroyers of insects during the summer months every observer knows The army worm finds in the English sparrow one of its most vigilant enemies As to the garden fruits we find that it molests none and kindly leaves all the cher ries to the robits and catbirds I have many grape vines trained against my buildings with an abun dance of sparrows roosting amid the clusters of grapes and have wondered at the sparrows poor judgment in not tasting a single bunch Such is my observation of this bird social in its habits appar ently of the most happy disposition but at times pugnacious with his relatives which encounters are never fatal in their consequences Certainly it is no concern of ours for they seem to possess in a remarkable degree the spirit of forgiveness and live on the whole in great social harmony We rightly know them as pest when they soil our piazzas and deface our windowcasings J D HICKS Old Westbury NY Equality in ability of the young of the human species We have a pernicious habit in this country of supposing that    all men    are born equal as to their abilities We have a different theory in regard to horses  It would perhaps be a good plan if the young of the human species were divided into two groups at an early age one large and one small one com posed of those of whom nothing more than plain NYCE VOL VII No 153 living is expected and the other composed of the race  horses of those whose ancestors or whose chance endowments give reason to hope that they may give some aid to learning or to culture Any one whose destiny is to do difficult thinking in after life should    dwell long among the geometrical concepts should become thoroughly imbued with the bare and rigid form of reasoning and should have the results as familiar as his mothertongue A criticism of a recent book on geometry in Science supplement of Jan 1 gives occasion to the critic to give the above views of a topic much wider than that of geometry He would differentiate the human species into two groups the racehorses and drayhorses and train them accordingly and the basis of the differentiation would be ancestry or  chance endowments Suppose this had been done in the past what chance is there that Watt Stephenson or Ericsson would have become known as engineers Franklin Faraday or Edison as electricians Napo leon or Grant as soldiers Lincoln or Garfield as statesmen Livingston as an explorer Carlyle as a writer Is it not notorious that most great men have not been descended from distinguished ances tors and that in most cases their chance endow ments have not been discovered either by them selves or by their friends until the age of manhood  The habit in this country of supposing all men born equal as to their abilities has had ample justification in the past and may have in the future Among the poorest families in the farthest west there are many Grants Lincolns or Garfields among callow chandlers clerks there are Franklins among Scot tish farmers there are Carlyles the poorest weavers may produce another Livingston  and some obscure Corsican may be another Napoleon We of the American branch of the AngloSaxon race have all a good ancestry Six generations back each of us had thirtytwo male ancestors at least one of whom must have been distinguished as a king a statesman a general a thinker or possibly as a gentlemanly scoundrel or freebooter and all American babies are born with some chance endowment which if given the proper environment will develop into ability But alas  the chances are that the grow ing child will not be given the proper environment He may have the ancestral traits or the chance endowments which would lead him to be a great soldier an artist an engineer or a farmer and he will be sent to school where all these traits or en dowments will be repressed and his education will tend to make him a storekeeper or a politician or he may not be sent to school at all and ancestral poverty may be the cause of his remaining a coal miner or a farmers hand  all his life and Grays Elegy  may be used as his epitaph Whether the young of the human species will de velop into racehorses or drayhorses is not generally determinable by ancestry or by  chance endowment but rather by environment during youth and early manhood The youth has the ancestry of both dray horse and racehorse combined and the chance en dowments are numerous enough to include some of the qualities of both Better assume that the young are born equal in ability and in their early training be ginning with the kindergarten give them an equal chance to develop into mechanics storekeepers artists farmers or lawyers than to differentiate them into the classes of racehorses and drayhorses at the beginning W K 4

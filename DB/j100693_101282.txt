AND EXACT RELATION OF A SANDFLOUD WHICH HATH LATELY OVERWHELMED A GREAT TRACT OF LAND IN THE COUNTY OF SUFFOLK TOGETHER WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE CHECK IN PART GIVEN TO IT COMMUNICATED IN AN OBLIGING LETTER TO THE PUBLISHER BY THAT WORTHY GENTLEMAN THOMAS WRIGHT ESQUIRE LIVING UPON THE PLACE AND A SUFFERER BY THAT DELUGE SIR I BEG YOUR PARDON THAT I HAVE NOT MADE AN EARLIER RETURN TO THE LETTER BY GIVING YOU THE ACCOUNT YOU REQUIRED OF THOSE PRODIGIOUS SANDS WHICH I HAVE THE UNHAPPINESS TO BE AL MOST BURIED IN AND BY WHICH A CONSIDERABLE PART OF MY SMALL FORTUNE IS QUITE SWALLOWD UP BUT I ASSURE YOU MY SILENCE WAS NOT THE RESULT OF ANY NEGLECT BUT RATHER OF MY RESPECTS TO YOU WHOSE EMPLOYMENTS I KNOW ARE TOO GREAT TO SUFFER YOU OFTEN VA CARE NUGIS THE TRUTH IS I SUSPENDED THE GIVING YOU ANY TROUBLE TILL I WAS PUT INTO SOME CAPACITY OF ANSWERING THE WHOLE LETTER AS WELL CONCERNING THOSE FEW IMPROVEMENTS THIS PART OF THE NA TION HAS MADE IN AGRICULTURE AS THESE WONDERFUL SANDS WHICH AL THOUGH THEY INHABIT WITH AND UPON ME AND HAVE NOT YET EXCEEDED ONE CENTURY SINCE THEY FIRST BROKE PRISON I COULD NOT WITHOUT SOME DIFFICULTY TRACE TO THEIR ORIGINAL BUT I NOW FIND IT TO BE IN A WARREN IN LAKENHEATH A TOWN BELONGING TO THE DEAN AND CHAPTER OF ELY DISTANT NOT ABOVE 5 MILES AND LYING SOUTHWEST AND BY WEST OF THIS PLACE WHERE SOME GREAT SANDHILLS WHEREOF THERE IS STILL A REMAINDER HAVING THE SUPERFICIES OR SWORD OF THE GROUND AS WE CALL IT BROKEN BY THE IMPETUOUS SOUTHWEST WINDS BLEW UPON SOME OF THE ADJACENT GROUNDS WHICH BEING MUCH OF THE SAME NATURE AND HAVING NOTHING BUT A THIN CRUST OF BARREN EARTH TO SECURE ITS GOOD BEHAVIOUR WAS SOON ROT TED AND DISSOLVED BY THE OTHER SAND AND THEREBY EASILY FITTED TO INCREASE THE MASS AND TO BEAR IT COMPANY IN THIS STRANGE PRO GRESS AT THE FIRST ERUPTION THEREOF WHICH DOES NOT MUCH EXCEED THE MEMORIES OF SOME PERSONS STILL LIVING I SUPPOSE THE WHOLE MA GAZIN OF SAND COULD NOT COVER ABOVE 8 OR 10 ACRES OF GROUND WHICH INCREASD INTO A 1000 ACRES BEFORE THE SAND HAD TRAVAILD723 TRAVAILED 4 MILES FROM ITS FIRST ABOAD INDEED IT MET WITH THIS ADVANTAGE THAT TILL IT CAME INTO THIS TOWN ALL THE GROUND IT PAST OVER WAS ALMOST OF AS MUTINOUS A NATURE AS IT SELF AND WANT ED NOTHING BUT SUCH A COMPANION TO SET IT FREE AND TO SOLLICIT IT TO THIS NEW INVASION ALL THE OPPOSITION IT MET WITH IN ITS JOURNY HITHER WAS FROM ONE FARMHOUSE WHICH STOOD WITHIN A MILE AND A HALF FROM ITS FIRST SOURCE THIS THE OWNER AT FIRST EN DEAVOURD TO HAVE SECURD BY FORCE AND BUILDING OF BULWORKS A GAINST THE ASSAULTS THEREOF BUT THIS WINGD ENEMY WAS NOT TO BE SO OPPOSD WHICH AFTER SOME DISPUTE THE OWNER PERCEIVING DID NOT ONLY SLIGHT THE FORMER WORKS BUT ALL HIS FENCES AND WHAT ELSE MIGHT OBSTRUCT THE PASSAGE OF THIS UNWELCOME GUEST AND IN FOUR YEARS EFFECTED THAT BY A COMPLIANCE AND SUBMISSION WHICH COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN DONE UPON OTHER TERMS IN WHICH HE WAS SO SUCCESSFUL AS THAT THERE IS SCARCE ANY FOOTSTEPS LEFT OF THIS MISCHIEVOUS ENEMY TIS BETWEEN 30 AND 40 YEARS SINCE IT FIRST REACHT THE BOUNDS OF THIS TOWN WHERE IT CONTINUED FOR 10 OR 12 YEARS IN THE OUTSKIRTS WITHOUT DOING ANY CONSIDERABLE MISCHIEF TO THE SAME THE REASON OF WHICH I GUESS TO BE THAT ITS CURRENT WAS THEN DOWNHILL WHICH SHELTERD IT FROM THOSE WINDS THAT GAVE IT MO TION BUT THAT VALLEY BEING ONCE PAST IT WENT ABOVE A MILE UPHILL IN TWO MONTHS TIME AND OVERRAN 200 ACRES OF VERY GOOD CORN THE SAME YEAR TIS NOW GOT INTO THE BODY OF THIS LITTLE TOWN WHERE IT HATH BURIED AND DESTROYD DIVERS TENE MENTS AND OTHER HOUSES AND HAS INFORCD US TO PRESERVE THE RE MAINDER AT A GREATER CHARGE THAN THEY ARE WORTH WHICH DOUBT LESS HAD ALSO PERISHT HAD NOT MY AFFECTION TO THIS POOR DWELLING OBLIGD ME TO PRESERVE IT AT A GREATER EXPENCE THAN IT WAS BUILT WHERE AT LAST I HAVE GIVEN IT SOME CHECKTHOUGH FOR 4 OR 5 YEARS OUR ATTAQUES ON BOTH SIDES WERE WITH SO VARIOUS SUCCESS AS THE VICTORY REMAIND VERY AMBIGUOUS FOR IT HAD SO POSSEST ALL OUR AVENUES AS THERE WAS NO PASSAGE TO US BUT OVER TWO WALLS OF 8 OR 9 FOOT HIGH WHICH INCOMPASSD A SMALL GROVE BEFORE MY HOUSE NOW ALMOST BURIED IN THE SAND NAY IT WAS ONCE SO NEAR A CONQUEST AS AT ONE END OF MY HOUSE IT WAS POSSEST OF MY YARD AND HAD BLOWN UP TO THE EVES OF MOST OF MY OUTHOUSES AT THE OTHER END IT HAD BROKE DOWN MY GARDENWALL AND STOPT ALL PAS SAGE THAT WAY BUT724 BUT DURING THESE HARD AND VARIOUS SKIRMESHES I OBSERVED THAT THAT WING OF SAND THAT GAVE ME THE ASSAULT BEGAN TO CONTRACT INTO A MUCH LESS COMPASS FOR BY STOPPING OF IT 4 OR 5 YEARS WHAT I COULD WITH FURREHEDGES SET UPON ONE ANOTHER AS FAST AS THE SAND LEVELLD THEM WHICH I FIND TO BE THE BEST EXPE DIENT TO HINDER ITS PASSAGE AND BY WHICH I HAVE RAISED SAND BANKS NEAR 20 YARDS HIGH I BROUGHT IT INTO THE CIRCUIT OF ABOUT 8 OR 10 ACRES AND THEN IN ONE YEAR BY LAYING SOME HUNDREDS OF LOADS OF MUCK AND GOOD EARTH UPON IT I HAVE AGAIN REDUCED IT TO TERRA FIRMA HAVE CLEARD ALL MY WALLS AND BY THE ASSISTANCE AND KINDNESS OF MY NEIGHBOURS WHO HELPD ME AWAY WITH ABOVE 1500 LOADS IN ONE MONTH CUT A PASSAGE TO MY HOUSE THROUGH THE MAIN BODY THEREOF BUT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN MET WITH A MUCH WORSE FATE WHERE DIVERS DWELLINGS ARE BURIED OR OVERTHROWN AND OUR PASTURES AND MEADOWS WHICH WERE VERY CONSIDERABLE TO SO SMALL A TOWN BOTH FOR QUANTITY AND QUALITY OVERRUN AND DESTROYD AND THE BRANCH OF THE RIVER OUSE UPON WHICH WE BORDER BEING BETTER KNOWN BY THE NAME OF THETFORDOR BRANDONRIVER BETWEEN WHICH TWO TOWNS WE LYE FOR 3 MILES TOGETHER SO FILLD WITH SAND THAT NOW A VESSEL WITH TWO LOAD WEIGHT PASSETH WITH AS MUCH DIFFICULTY AS BEFORE WITH 10 BUT HAD NOT THE STREAM IN TERPOSD TO STOP ITS PASSAGE INTO NORFOLK DOUBTLESS A GOOD PART OF TH T COUNTRY HAD ERE NOW BEEN LEFT A DESOLATE TROPHY OF THIS CONQUERING ENEMY FOR ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION OF ITS IN CREASE IN THESE 5 MILES WHICH WAS FROM 10 ACR TO 15 O OR 20 0 IN 10 MILES MORE OF THE SAME SOIL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SWELLD TO A GREAT VASTNESS AND NOW SIR I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE HISTORY OF OUR SANDS I SHALL OUT OF MY RESPECTS TO YOUR DESIGN WHICH I TRULY VENE RATE AND SHOULD BE GLAD TO BE SUBSERVIENT TO IN THE MEANEST CAPA CITY MAKE THIS POOR ESSAY TOWARDS A DISCOVERY OF A REASON AND CAUSE OF THIS STRANGE ACCIDENT WHERE THE FIRST THING OBSERVA BLE TO ME IS THE QUALITY AND SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THIS TROUBLESOME GUEST FIRST TOOK HIS RISE WHICH LYES EAST NORDEAST OF A PART OF THE GREAT LEVEL OF THE FENNS AND IS THERE BY FULLY EXPOSED TO THE RAGE OF THOSE IMPETUOUS BLASTS WE YEAR LY RECEIVE OUT OF THE OPPOSITE QUARTER WHICH I SUPPOSE ACQUIRE MORE725 MORE THAN AN ORDINARY VIGOR BY THE WINDS PASSING THROUGH SO LONG A TRACT WITHOUT ANY CHECK WHICH WHEN IT HAS GONE SO FAR IN TRIUMPH MAKES ITS FIRST ASSAULTS WITH THE GREATER FURY THE O THER THING THAT CONTRIBUTES TO IT IS THE EXTREAM SANDINESS OF THE SOYL THE LEVITY OF WHICH I BELIEVE GAVE OCCASION TO THAT LAND STORY OF THE ACTIONS THAT USE TO BE BROUGHT IN NORFOLK FOR GROUNDS BLOWN OUT OF THE OWNERS POSSESSION BUT THIS COUNTY OF SUFFOLK IS MORE FRIENDLY IN THAT PARTICULAR I HAVING HITHERTO POSSESSED GREAT QUANTIES OF THIS WANDRING LAND WITHOUT ANY SCRUPLE WHICH I SHOULD YET BE GLAD TO BE RIDD OFF WITHOUT ANY THING FOR THE KEEP ING IF THE OWNERS WOULD BUT DO ME KINDNESS TO FETCH IT AWAY AS TO OUR GEORGICKS THEY ARE SO LITTLE THE CARE AND STUDY OF ANY INGENIOUS PERSONS IN THESE PARTS THAT I AM ASHAMD I MUST BE SO BREEF UPON A SUBJECT SO MUCH EVERY BODIES CONCERN THE GREAT EST MATTERS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE HATH BEEN BY MARLING FOR 50 LOAD OF

BUSHEL AND AN HALF SOWETH AN ACRE AND THE SEED IS NOW BROUGHT TO 12 S THE COMB OR 4 BUSHELS WHICH WAS LATELY AT 40 S THE SAME GENTLEMAN HAD THE LAST YEAR 10 COMBS PER ACRE OF COLESEED UPON A VERY DRY

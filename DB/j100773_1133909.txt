Assembly shall provide for the maintenance and support of a humane and efficient penal system in accordance with modern scientific principles of penology such system to include adequate provision for suspension of sentence the indeterminate sentence and release on probation and parole of convicted offenders as may be determind by law It shall also provide that all persons convicted of crime or delinquency who shall be committed to penal correctional or reformatory institutions shall be em ployed in useful labor and shall receive such treatment and instruction as shall tend to effect their moral reformation and qualify them to become useful citizens of the Commonwealth Section 2 The General Assembly shall create such administrative and supervisory department or departments or such other agencies as may be necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this article If such article is adopted it will pave the way for the establishment of some general system whereby more care and supervision may be given to the efficient management of all our prisons The principles of reformation and employment will be recognized as being inherent in any scheme for the treatment of offenders The commission had already proposed that the fee system should be abolished so far as county officials are concerned hence we did not include the revocation of fees for boarding prisoners in our prop osition Annual Report of the New Jersey State PrisonThe Report of the New Jersey State Prison for 1919 is unique when compared with the usual run of prison literature A large part of the pamphlet is made up of the psychologists report Examination by psychological methods was begun in this prison in February 1919 A total of 839 prisoners had been examined by the army group intelligence test Alpha prior to July 1 1919 This is the group test used for the examination of illiterate army recruits The author shows a graph showing the distribution of 6541 white draft recruits of the summer draft at Camp Dix New Jersey A distribution of letter grade scores of this draft is identical with the distribution of one and a half million recruits in the army as a whole A curve is therefore representative not only of the State of New Jersey but also of the army as a whole The Beta subjects illiterate recruits of this draft are represented on the same graph This makes possible the direct comparison of army mentality with the New Jersey prison mentality The following facts are evident from an inspection of the table and curves 1 Fortyone per cent of the prisoners obtain scores below 15 This indicates a degree of literacy below that of the third school grade and consti tutes failure in this examination A very small number of these failures are due to unwillingness to take the examination seriously but individual exami nation and questioning indicate that this number is very small This percentage of practical illiteracy is 36 per cent greater than in the army recruits with whom the prisoners are compared 2 The average score is 25 points This average score is 15 points below the average of recruits in the army but as will subsequently be shown is much influenced by disproportionate numbers of negroes and foreigners in the prison who tend to obtain very low scores in any mental examination 295 NEW JERSEY STATE PRISON29 TEAMNTOFDFETIE 3 A small percentage of prisoners 7 per cent obtain scores equivalent to those of typical army officers above 105 points as compared with 13 per cent of recruits 4 Comparing the prison scores as a whole with the army scores as a whole disregarding the excessive number of negroes and lowgrade foreigners we observe that the lowest 50 per cent of prisoners equal the lowest 40 per cent of draft recruits while the highest 10 per cent of prisoners do not exceed the highest 25 per cent of draft recruits that is to say the prison population as a whole is somewhat inferior in intelligence to the army population as a whole if we disregard the heavy proportion of negroes and lowgrade foreigners in the prison This army curve includes no negroes while the prison curve in cludes about 25 per cent negroes who tend to score below whites in this exami nation It is altogether impossible in a brief abstract to do justice to this report as a whole Dr Doll makes in the whole report a close analysis of crime condi tions as he found them in the study of the population of the New Jersey prisonR H G Preventive Work in the Los Angeles California Public SchoolsWe have at hand the first annual report of the Division of Psychology in the Los Angeles Public School system This relates to work in ungraded rooms Dr A H Sutherland the psychologist in charge of the work is making a great contribution in that city to what promises to be a successful carrying out of a plan for the prevention of delinquency and other social maladjustments It appears to many of us that the logical place to do this preventive work is the public schools Educational Treatment of DefectivesThis is the subject of an inter esting contribution by Alice M Nash and S D Porteus in the Training School Bulletin for November 1919 It is one of a large number of important publi cations from the Department of Research in the Training School at Vineland New Jersey A summary of the findings of the research follows 1 In a great many cases the special class fails either because it is not fitting the defective for any occupation or because he does not follow in after life the occupation for which he has been trained 2 Children vary just as much in their capacities for manual training as they do in scholastic abilities In the great majority of instances special classes are not paying attention to this fact Teaching a defective some scraps of woodwork or basketry is not helping very much to solve the question of his ultitmate selfsupport 3 There are indirect advantages of special class work with defectives the main one being that the regular grades may do better when the feebleminded are eliminated 4 The purpose of this paper is to put down Vinelands educational experi ence Its plan is to take each subject in turn and to attempt to justify its posi tion in the curriculum either of the special school or special class 5 An important point is the right selection of children for training in the various departments For scholastic training the Binet tests give the best basis of classification For industrial abilities the Porteus tests give the best indica tions 296 TREATMENT OF DEFECTIVES

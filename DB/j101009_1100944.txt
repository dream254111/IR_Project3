Com pany for leave to acquire by condemnation proceedings lands owned by the Great Falls Power Company From an order grant ing the application defendant appeals Reversed William H White for appellant R Walton Moore and D S Mackall for appellee HARRISON J This is an appeal from an order of the State Corporation Commission granting an application made by the Feb 8141906 GREAT FALLS POWER CO V GREAT FALLS C R CO appellee railroad company to be allowed to acquire by condemna tion proceedings certain lands owned by the appellant power company situated in the county of Fairfax The Great Falls Power Company was incorporated by an act of the General Assembly of Virginia approved March 3 1894 as amended by an act approved March 5 1894 Acts 189394 pp 669782 for the purpose of acquiring holding improving and using water power at the Great Falls in the Potomac river and for constructing dams therein canals and other hydraulic and auxiliary steam works and for the selling and leasing of water power and using the same for manufacturing etc generating transmitting selling and leasing electricity electric power and light for railway and canal as well as other purposes The appellant owns on the Virginia side of the Potomac river a tract of land containing between 700 and 800 acres procured at a cost of 500000 for the purposes contemplated by its incorpo ration and has expended a large sum in perfecting elaborate plans for contemplated improvements This tract of land is shown by the appellee to be as wild as the Rocky Mountains The Great Falls  Old Dominion Railroad Company was incor porated by an act of the General Assembly of Virginia approved January 24 1900 as amended by an act approved March 29 1902 Acts 18991900 p 148 Acts 190102 p 457 with power to locate build and operate a railroad commencing at some point on the Potomac river in Alexandria county opposite the District of Columbia and running thence by the most practicable route to a point on the Potomac river in Fairfax county or Lou doun county Va The record shows that this railroad line has been located from the Aqueduct Bridge in Alexandria county opposite the District of Columbia to a point in Fairfax county on the Potomac river at the Great Falls a distance of some 14 miles and that the work of building an electric railway has been begun and prosecuted to the extent of reconstructing the Aqueduct Bridge and making roadbed bridges and culverts in Alexandria county at an outlay of about 300000 Both of these companies the appellant and the appellee are given under their respective charters the power of eminent domain This proceeding was inaugurated under section 52 of the act concerning corporations to obtain from the State Corporation 81511 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Commission a certificate in accordance with the provisions of that section authorizing the appellee to condemn the following three several parcels of land belonging to the appellant located in the county of Fairfax at the Great Falls on the Potomac river namely Parcel No 1 containing 93 acres No 2 containing 768 acres and No 3 containing 94 acres The point sought to be condemned is shown to be very rough and ruggedrocky about as wild a piece of property as there is anywhere in the state of Virginia Section 52 provides as follows No corporation shall take by condemnation proceedings any property belonging to any other corporation possessing the power of eminent domain unless after hearing all parties in interest the State Corporation Commission shall certify that a public necessity or that an essential public con venience shall so require and shall give its permission thereto and in no event shall one corporation take by condemnation pro ceedings any property owned by and essential to the purposes of another corporation possessing the power of eminent domain Va Code 1904 p 576 c 46a  1105e subd 52 It is clear from this statute that before the land of the appellant can be condemned by the appellee two facts must be made to ap pear 1 That a public necessity or that an essential public convenience requires that the land shall be taken and 2 that such land is not essential to the purposes of the appellant Prior to the present law under which this proceeding was taken the land of appellant could not have been condemned by the appellee because it had no legislative permission to take the property of another corporation Alexandria etc R R Co v A W R R Co 75 Va 780 40 Am Rep 743 R F  P R R Co v Johnston 103 Va 456 49 S L 496 The right therefore of one corporation to condemn property already devoted to the public use by another should not be ex tended by construction beyond the explicit requirements of the statute giving that power The evidence tends very stroingly to show that the land sought to be condemned is essential to the appellant for the development of its water power and that if taken the power company would be compelled to change its plans entirely that there is a physical conflict between the use contemplated by the appellee and that Feb 8161906 GREAT FALLS POWER CO V GREAT FALLS C R CO designed by the appellant It is not necessary however in the view we take of the case to pass upon or to consider this question Its legislative grant of power authorized the appellee to estab lish a railroad from some point on the Potomac river in Alex andria county to sorte point on that river in either the county of Fairfax or the county of Loudoun It would meet the require ments of the charter for the terminal of the road to be located at any point on the river within the limits of the counties mentioned The appellee owns land on the river above and adjoining that owned by the appellant Above and adjoining the land of ap pellant it owns a tract of 30 acres which appears to have been bought with a view to the use now sought to be made by condem nation of the land of appellant The property in question how ever covers a commanding view of the Great Falls of the Po tomac river which is shown to be one of the grandest pieces of natural scenery in this country second only in beauty and attract iveness to the Falls of Niagara It clearly appears that this land is sought by appellee as a termi nal point on account of the rare scenic features it affords and be cause of the attractions it would hold out to pleasure seekers from the city of Washington In other respects the location possesses none of the advantages ordinarily accruing to a railroad and but for the beauty of the scene would most likely have been avoided as offering no inducements to such an enterprise It is further clear from the record that the quantity of land sought to be con demned is far beyond any necessity for mere terminal purposes of an electric railway extending a distance of 14 miles from the city of Washington It is manifest from the evidence that the location was selected with no reference to the public use of the road in the matter of freight or the accommodation of the travel ing public along the route but that the real purpose of the con demnation is to establish a park overlooking the Great Falls of the Potomac for the comfort and pleasure of sightseers and curiosity seekers and to thereby add to the revenues of appellee by making the point an attractive place of resort To justify the Corporation Commission in taking the action here complained of it must not only appear that the land sought to be condemned is for public use but it must affirmatively appear 81711 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER that a public necessity or an essential public convenience requires that the land of the appellant shall be taken What is a public use is said to be incapable of exact definition that it is easier to define by negation than by affirmation What ever rule may be formulated on the subject as a result of the ad judged cases it cannot we think include the condemnation here sought as one made for a public use Looking to the charter of the appellee we find that the company was organized for public use in transporting persons and property along its line in other words has undertaken an ordinary railroad enterprise The ground upon which private property may be taken for railroad uses without the consent of the owner is primarily that railroads are highways furnishing means of communication between dif ferent points and promoting traffic and commerce The taking of property for these parposes must always be limited to the lawful necessities of the enterprise The moment the appropriation goes beyond such necessity it ceases to be justified on the principles which underlie the right of eminent domain Cooleys Const Lim pp 779 780 The charter of appellee furnishes no warrant for condemning property for the purpose indicated by the record It is doubtless an attractive point on account of its inspiring scenery for the lo cation of a park and such a terminal would very probably increase the revenues of appellee but to gratify the senses of the pleasure seeker and thereby incidentally to increase revenues is without the domain of a public use for which private property may be taken under the power of eminent domain In a wellconsidered case in New York where the railroad company was given power to condemn private property for public use it applied for the condemnation of a part of the land belong ing to De Veaux College which commands a view of the Whirlpool Rapids Its purpose was to give visitors a view of those rapids It was held that this was not a public use for which private property could be taken the court saying in part The fact that the road of petitioner may enable the portion of the pub lic who visit Niagara Falls more easily or more fully to gratify their curiosity or that the road will be public in the sense that all who desire will be entitled to be carried upon it is not sufficient we think in view of the other necessary limi Feb 8181906 GREAT FALLS POWER CO V GREAT FALLS C R CO tations to make the enterprise a public one so as to justify con demnation proceedings The case does not we think differ in principle from an attempt on the part of a private corporation under color of an act of the Legislature to condemn lands for an inclined railway or for a circular railway or for an observatory to promote the enjoyment or convenience of those who may visit the Falls In re Niagara Falls  W Ry Co 108 N Y 375 15 N E 429 This case is very much in point and the authorities there cited and the reasons given apply with equal force to the case at bar for it is clear from the record that the part of the railroad running through the land of the appellant is not intended for ordinary traffic but only for sightseers We have seen that the use here sought to be made of appellants property is not a public use in the sense that it can be taken under the power of eminent domain The case at bar is however very much stronger than the Niagara Falls Case because granting that the use sought to be made by appellee of the land in question came within the meaning of a public use justifying condemna tion still the land could not be taken for the appellant being a corporation with the power of eminent domain its land could not be condemned by another corporation possessing that power un less the public use sought to be made of it reached the measure of a public necessity or an essential public convenience This is the express mandate of the recent statute under which this pro ceeding is had and without which the application of appellee could not be entertained Scenic advantages were held in the Niagara Falls Case not to reach the measure of a public use justifying condemnation pro ceedings a fortiori must such advantages fail for insufficiency when subjected to the test of the public necessity contemplated by our law Spending a pleasant day in the midst of wild and rugged surroundings on the banks of the Potomac viewing its Great Falls while strolling in a beautiful park would doubtless be both inspiring and invigorating to those who had the time and opportunity to enjoy it That sightseers should be furnished such an opportunity may be desirable but it cannot be said to be a public necessity demanding the displacement of appellant from 81911 VIRGINIA LAW RtGISTER its private ownership by the compulsory proceedings here in voked For these reasons we are of opinion that the State Corporation Commission erred in awarding appellee the certificate complained of and therefore its action must be reversed the order appealed from set aside and the cause remanded to the State Corporation Commission for such further proceedings in the premises as the appellee may be advised to take with a view to condemning land for its uses through the lands of the appellant not in conflict with the views expressed in this opinion NoteThis is a very important opinion and farreaching in its consequences and is remarkable as being the first case in which the Corporation Commission has been reversed One point that came before the court is worthy of notice Sec 1105e 52 Va Code 1904 provides that no corporation shall take by condemnation proceedings property belonging to another corporation possessing the power of eminent domain unless the State Corporation Commission shall cer tify that a public necessity or that an essential public convenience requires that the land shall be taken The court after examining the record of the case before the Corporation Commission overruled the same on the ground among others that the use sought to be made of the appellants property did not reach the measure of a public necessity or an essential public convenience In the recent case of the City of Richmond v County of Henrico et als decided in the Circuit Court of Henrico Dec 18 1905 and re ported in the January number of the Virginia Law Register 11 Va Law Reg 752 a similar question was before the court There it was contended that the act Sec 1014a Va Code 1904 under which the court proceeded was unconstitutional because it delegated legis lative power to the judiciary in leaving to the court to determine the expediency and necessity of the annexation desired In the latter case the statute required that the municipal council should first pass upon the necessity for or the expediency of annexation and set forth the same in the form of an ordinance and then allowed the court to pass upon the findings of the municipal council The defendants de murred to the proceedings on the ground that this was a delegation of legislative power to the judiciary but the court after an examina tion of many authorities concluded that the objection could not be sustained In the principal case the statutory provision is for the Corporation Commission after hearing all parties to certify that a public neces sity or that an essential public convenience requires the condemna tion of the land in question This was a function formerly left to the Legislature but by the opinion of the Supreme Court in the principal case it is seen that the question is one over which that court will exercise a supervisory power in reference to the findings of the Cor poration Commission There seems to have been no objection in the principal case that the Supreme Court in the examination of such a question was exercising power which was in violation of the maxim delegata potestas non potest delegari and it would seem that the two Feb 82019061 GREAT FALLS POWER CO V GRtAT FALLS C R CO 821 questions are identical and that the conclusions of the Circuit Court of Henrico County are sustained by the opinion of the principal case Subsequent to the decision in the principal case there was a petition for rehearing In the petition a copy of which has come into our hands since writing the above the following propositions were con tended for I Under the general law land held by a corporation not in use or essential to the exercise of its franchise can be condemned II The condemning company must be a public use corporation i e a public service corporation The presumption is that any com pany authorized by the legislature to acquire property by condemna tion is of this nature The presumption is conclusive in case of a company whose railroad is to be open to the public and subject to control as a commpn carrier of passengers and freight III The existence of a scenic or health or recreation feature as sociated with other features does not affect the nature of thecom pany so as to make it the less a public use or public service corporation It is imperative that the enterprise should be regarded and treated as a whole It is not permissible to single out particular features IV The statute section 52 of the Act Concerning Corporations in this instance does not apply except to transfer to the State Cor poration Commission the decision of two questions namely a whether the railroad is a public use as to which there can be no doubt and b whether the land sought to be taken is essential to the purposes of the Power Company The question of public neces sity or convenience was in this instance determined by the General Assembly in granting its charter to the Railroad Company prior to the enactment of section 52 and in view Qf section 62 there can be no pretext for the proposition that the General Assembly meant by that enactment to reopen the question and thereby divest a right or privilege already conferred and interfere with or destroy a work of internal improvemeht already begun V If however the State Corporation Commission is charged with the duty of deciding any except the two questions mentioned in the next preceding paragraph it is the question as to whether the land sought to be taken or any part of it is necessary or convenient to the purpose of the Railroad Company This question of necessity or convenience is wholly apart from the question of the public char acter of the condemning corporation and is largely within the discre tion of the condemning corporation VI The question of necessity or convenience is not a new ques tion but is an old question and to be determined according to old and wellestablished principles and standards VII The question of necessity is a question of fact and the ad mission of the Great Falls Power Company as disclosed by its agreement with the Railroad Company and otherwise that the acqui sition of the land is necessary to the execution of the common car riers plans should weigh heavily in its determination The same is true in regard to the propriety of the location as the basis for such plans VIII The land sought to be taken for the most part is not only incapable of any use whatever by the Power Company but it is far822 11 VIRGINIA LAW RtGISTIR Feb beyond the needs if not far beyond the right of the Power Company to hold The crossing by the Railroad Company of the possible canal of the Power Company which is

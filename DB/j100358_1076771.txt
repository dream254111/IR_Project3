to Roland P Falkner 281 Fourth Avenue New York N Y Over fifty students in the Boston high school have been studying Esperanto in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and have now made application at their own school for a room in which to continue their study They have been assigned a room in the English high school on Montgomery Street in connection with the central evening school and are to meet there on Friday evenings Advocates of reestablishing corporal punishment received a setback at the meeting of the New York Board of Education on February 26 Both the boards of aldermen and of superintendents declared against it saying that punishment did not reform but tended to develop hypocrites and sullen animosity The matter was laid on the table till the next meeting Attention to the physical wellbeing of schoolchildren would result in immediate and great economy said Dr Luther Gulick at the convention of the National Education Association in Washington the last week in Feb ruary The problem is fundamental because education must not be obtained at the expense of health it is new in importance because only recently has education come to dominate the great bulk of the childs waking time The crowded condition of the cities the lack of compulsory exercise in walking long distances to school the constant noise and light of the city all these create new and serious problems in the physical welfare of the children It is greatly to be regretted that while drawing is often well taught in primary and grammar schools it is neglected in the high schools just at the 278NOTES AND NEWS time when its practice would be of highest value So says Professor War ren in an article on artappreciation in the New England Magazine Drawing encourages accuracy of observation and should tend to develop appreciation of beauty Professor Warren also suggests that the use of artmuseums should be largely confined to the high schools rather than to the lower grades This use he thinks should be chiefly incident to the study of history and should not be too analytic The teaching of scientific home management for highschool girls is recom mended by Superintendent Van Sickle of Baltimore City in his annual report He adds I do not mean mere cooking and sewing These are taught in the elementary grades I refer to a sort of training of as high an order as that given to boys in the Polytechnic Institute namely a course in the application of scientific principles to daily life At present the girl in her highschool course finds open to her but one vocational department that of stenography and typewriting The Iowa School Law Commission is to be favored with suggestions collected in Midland Schools from over forty superintendents and other officials State aid for high schools of a certain grade is recommended and in connection with this the raising of the minimum standard of requirements in the high school It is a recognized fact says one that our high schools furnish the vast majority of the teachers in the state A special plea is also made for the residents of the country and for the maintenance of high schools which will meet their needs and which are situated in localities which they can reach The New England Journal of Education contains an article on some inter esting developments in music in Chelsea Mass A municipal music com mission created in January has the supervision of this work Frequent concerts are given for the children of all grades in some of which the high school glee club takes a prominent part This glee club is recruited from singers trained in the glee clubs of the grades it in turn sends its best mem bers on to join the Mendelssohn choral club of the city It is not surprising that as the author remaiks the people in our maligned little community are in a receptive condition as to music Only thirteen towns in Massachusetts are without highschool privileges Nothing approaching this has been attained elsewhere In industrial training says President Roosevelt in an address quoted by the New England Journal of Education we have tended to devote our energies to producing highgrade men at the top rather than in the ranks Our engineering schools compare favorably with the best in Europe whereas we have done almost nothing to equip the private soldiers of the industrial armythe mechanic the metalworker the carpenter Manual labor 279THE SCHOOL REVIEW can never take the high place it should take unless it offers scope for the best type of man Progress cannot consist in the abandonment of physical labor but in the development of physical labor so that it shall represent the work of the trained mind in the trained body In accomplishing this the president says that industrial training is one of the most potent factors in national development Over eight million dollars were spent by New York State for secondary education during the past year as shown by Commissioner Drapers annual report The annual cost per capita in the high schools was 8037 an increase of 029 The libraries of secondary schools have been increased by some forty thousand volumes As a teacher of modern languages and of Latin for many years I protest against the assumption that Latin is the best preparation for the study of modern languages says C E Arnoux in American Education Latin bears less analogy to modern tongues than any one of the modern languages bears to the rest Neither in material nor in structure is it of as much use as any modern language It is a formidable handicap in the learn ing of Romance pronunciations and the student has to lose valuable time in unlearning his Latin before he can learn his French Mr Arnoux would give Latin a grudging recognition as preparation for oriental languages and as a subject for the philologist but he would bar it from high schools alto gether Among the problems of education forced upon the English government in India is that of the language in which instruction shall be given The Bishop of Madras holds that the education of young India in English is a heavy burden on the people and accounts for the depressing failure of edu cational hopes But says Indian Education what language is the alterna tive In a classroom in Madras we counted seven vernaculars side by side Moreover if the universities are not to become sectional in the narrowest sense the lower schools must send up to them students capable of following lectures in English Verily America has much to be thankful for in the willingness of its foreign invaders to learn one language Botany and Zoology as taught in secondary schools should be given a biological not a morphological trend says Professor Borzi of the Univer sity of Palermo in a paper translated for the Journal of Education The complications of forms are of no importance in themselves and cannot more over hold the attention and interest of the young student He would con duct the study of plants and animals with reference to three great problems those of nutrition reproduction and protection against adverse influences in the environment The proportion of the population in high schools has nearly doubled in the past fifteen years says the Interstate Schoolman On the other hand 280NOTES AND NEWS there is not a proportionate increase in the number of highschool students preparing for college This indicates the new position of the high school not as formerly a preparation for college but a preparation for life in a much broader sense There is little wonder then in the emphasis increasingly placed on the less academic side of highschool training Industrial training should be given in the regular high schools not in separate schools contends William McAndrew in the Educational Review He bases this conclusion on the snobbishness of the purely academic schools toward the technical schools If you start your industrial school apart from your established institutions you ostracize it you make it like a school for colored children Our New York technical high school for girls the Wash ington Irving is called in derision by the teachers and scholars of the old line high schools the Washing and Ironing High School Teachers who were transferred to it from a purely academic high school were distressed When the question of separating the academic and technical divisions of this school was brought up decision was almost unanimously against it President Eliot said The mixture of technical and academic work will give a better result than either alone And President Hadley of Yale pleaded for the gain to society resulting from the contact of different types of students with each other This affiliation says the author is a valuable corrective against the onesidedness of modern industry Isolated industrial schools run great risk of domination by the employer The diffusion of education in Mexico seems to be a slow process accord ing to Education for February President Diaz has recently been making determined efforts for the enforcement of the compulsoryattendance law Out of a population of over twelve million there are some six hundred thousand enrolled in primary schools There are only thirtysix secondary schools and twenty normal schools However it must be remembered that 80 per cent of the population is either Indian or of mixed race This increases the difficulty of the problem Religious and denominational differences still trouble the English second ary schools Until last August no discrimination was made in government grants between denominational and undenominational schools says a corre spondent of Indian Education The rapid advance made in secondary educa tion in the past five years may be traced largely to the tolerance of this policy But last August new and discriminating regulations were passed Many comments of an unfavorable nature are being called out The Aububon Society is starting an attempt to organize every body of pupils in every kind of public school into a general movement for pro tecting wild birds It is already in touch with thousands of teachers and boys and girls clubs says the Springfield Republican The children areTHE SCHOOL REVIEW urged to build houses and prepare places for this years bird families before the coming of spring In a pamphlet entitled Forestry in the Public Schools issued by the forest service of the United States Department of Agriculture H A Wink enwerder demands that the problems of the American people be set forth in connection with school work If a teacher of history does not interest his pupils in the coming elections and cause them to apply past instruction to the questions which should decide their vote he fails to correlate the school and the world There are few national conditions that have had a greater influence on the economic social and political development of the country than its forests With this fact in mind Mr Winkenwerder asks for atten tion to the problems of forestry and timber supply which now face the American people And as President Roosevelt says The forest problem is in many ways the most vital internal problem in the United States History and geography furnish the avenues of introduction to this question WOOLLEYS HANDBOOK OF COMPOSITION By EDWIN C WOOLLEY University of Wisconsin Professor T E Rankin University of Michigan says Woolleys Handbook of Composition should be in the hands of every highschool student in the land In fact few university students who are practicing composition would fail to profit by frequent reference to it It is just the kind of book every student who has to write ought to have at his command It contains 246 pages is printed on thin paper bound in flexible cover which makes it convenient for the pocket and excellent for quick reference PRICE 80 CENTS D C HEATH  COMPANY PUBLISHERS BOSTON NEW YORK CHICAGO LONDONNOTES AND NEWS From Pittsburgh comes an idea which is worthy of general adoption The director of the high schools Mr Edward Rynearson with his colleagues the heads of departments of the high school has issued a circular of infor mation for the parents of the pupils in the seventh and eighth grades which is admirably adapted to inform parents of the reasons for sending their children to the high school and by its artistic appearance to interest them from the start in the institution Some general facts with regard to the value of highschool education based upon statistics and investigations are fol lowed by specific information concerning the Pittsburgh high school and its various courses The Committee on High Schools has issued a little booklet of 26 pages in a highly artistic form and we should anticipate that many parents who are more or less in doubt as to their childrens work would be at least enough impressed so that they would desire further counsel if they were at all uncertain as to the value of the highschool course TO BE READY APRIL I5 ENGLISH COMPOSITION By CHARLES LANE HANSON Instructor in English in the Mechanic Arts High School Boston A LITTLE book of some two hundred pages not too difficult for pupils just entering the high school It encourages them to make the best use of the equipment they bring from lower schools and in this connection points out the practical value of the essentials of grammar It presents in a simple and attractive way the main principles of composition The models are not the kind that boys and girls passively admire as impossible but are interesting and stimulating Some of them were written by highschool pupils and all of them have stood the test of the classroom FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ADDRESS GINN  COMPANY 230I23II Prairie Avenue CHICAGO ILL 4THE SCHOOL REVIEW The Physics Club of New York at its regular meeting held March 7 I908 unanimously adopted the following resolution Resolved that a uniform course in physics for all schools is both unde sirable and unattainable We therefore recommend I That syllabi should deal with the barest outline of general principles leaving each teacher free to fill up the course according to his best judgment 2 That examinations for college entrance should be confined to the general principles specified in the syllabus and that a teachers certificate should be accepted for other material This might well take the form of a rather full statement of the work done

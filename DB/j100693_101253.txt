INVETERATE PHRENSY BY THE TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD THIS LETTER WAS LATELY SENT BY THE AUTHOR HIMSELF TO THE PUBLISHER AS IT WAS PRINTED AT PARIS IN FRENCH THE SUBSTANCE WHEREOF IS IN ENGLISH AS FOLLOWS IT IS NOW ALMOST A TWELVEMONTH THAT I DECLARED MY SELF PUB LICKLY IN THIS MATTER OF TRANSFUSION AND AFTER I HAD GROUNDED MY CONJECTURES UPON DIVERS REASONS AND A NUMBER OF EXPERI MENTS WHICH I MADE JOYNTLY WITH M EMMEREZ I RESOLVD TO EXPECT IN THE SEQUEL A FURTHER CONFIRMATION BY CAREFULLY OBSER VING ALL THAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE SEVERAL TRIALS I INTENDED TO PRACTICE IN THIS RESOLUTION WE HAVE SINCE LET SLIP NO OCCASION TO IM PROVE THIS OPERATION WHICH HATH BEEN FOLLOWD WITH GOOD SUC CESS AND I COULD HERE ALLEDGE SOME PARTICULAR RELATIONS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH WOULD APPEAR CURIOUS ENOUGH IF I DID NOT618 NOT RATHER CHOOSE TO REFERR THEM TO A COLLECTION WHICH POSSIBLY I MAY SEND YOU WITHIN SOME TIME TO HAVE THE MORE ROOM TO ENLARGE IN THIS LETTER ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A STORY WHEREOF YOU WILL BE VERY GLAD TO LEARN THE EVENT YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS HEARD OF A MADMAN THAT HATH BEEN LATE LY CURED AND RESTORED TO HIS WITS BY THE MEANS OF THE TRANSFU SION SOME SPREAD A RUMOUR THAT HE DIED SOON AFTER THE OPERA TION OTHERS BORE THE PEOPLE IN HAND THAT HE WAS RELAPSED INTO A GREATER MADNESS THAN THAT BEFORE AND IN SHORT IT HATH BEEN SO DIVERSLY DISCOURSED OF UP AND DOWN AND WITH SUCH DIFFERING REFLECTIONS THEREON THAT I THOUGHT MY SELF OBLIGED FOR THE CLEAR ING UP OF WHAT FALSE RUMOURS HAD DARKEND TO GIVE YOU A FAITH FUL AND EXACT ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITION TO WHICH THIS POOR MAN WAS REDUCED BEFORE THE TRANSFUSION OF WHAT PASSED DURING THAT OPERATION AND THE SURPRISING EFFECTS THAT HAVE FOLLOWED UPON IT HITHERTO THE PATIENT IS ABOUT 34 YEARS OF AGE HIS PHRENSY BEGAN FIRST OF ALL TO APPEAR 7 OR 8 YEARS AGO AND AS FAR AS CAN BE JUDG ED IT WAS OCCASIOND BY A DISGRACE HE RECEIVED A LITTLE BEFORE IN SOME AMOURS WHERE HE HOPED TO FIND A VERY CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE THIS FIRST FIT OF EXTRAVAGANCE WAS VERY VIOLENT AND LA LTED 10 MONTHS WITHOUT ANY GOOD INTERVAL BUT RETURNING AFTER WARD BY LITTLE AND LITTLE TO HIS WITS AND HAVING GIVEN ALL THE POS SIBLE MARKS OF A SOUND UNDERSTANDING HE WAS MARRIED TO A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN WHO WAS PERSWADED THAT THIS MADNESS OF HIS WAS THE RELICK OF A SICKNESS HE HAD BEFORE AND THAT THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE HE WOULD EVER RELAPSE INTO IT BUT THIS WAS FAR FROM PROVING SO AS WAS IMAGINED AND EVEN THE VERY FIRST YEAR OF HIS MARRIAGE ENDED NOT WITHOUT HIS RETURNING TO HIS FORMER EX TRAVAGANCIES THUS THEN HE RELAPSED AND WAS SEVERAL TIMES RESTORED THESE 7 OR 8 YEARS LAST PAST BUT WHAT IS HERE CHIEFLY TO BE OBSERVED IS THAT THE FIT NEVER LASTED WITH HIM LESS THAN 8 OR 10 MONTHS WITHOUT ANY RESPIT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE CARE AND MEANS USED TO RELIEVE HIM FOR IT IS ALSO FIT TO TAKE NOTICE THAT A PERSON OF QUALITY HAVING ONCE TAKEN A PURPOSE TO ATTEMPT HIS CURE BY ALL MANNER OF WAYS CAUSED HIM TO BE BLED IN HIS FEET ARMS AND HEAD EVEN 18 TIMES AND MADE HIM BATHE HIMSELF 40 TIMES NOT619 NOT TO MENTION INNUMERABLE APPLICATIONS TO HIS FOREHEAD AND POTIONS BUT INSTEAD OF AMENDMENT THE DISTEMPER SEEMD TO BE PROVOKED BY THOSE REMEDIES AND THIS POOR CREATURE FELL INTO THAT RAGE THAT THERE WAS A NECESSITY TO BIND HIM UP FROM DOING MISCHIEF HIS MADNESS HATH BEEN ALWAYS PERIODICAL AND NE VER ABATED BUT BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND THAT ABATEMENT HATH BE FALLEN HIM RATHER AT SUCH TIMES WHEN NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM THAN WHEN HE WAS TORMENTED WITH MEDICINES THE LAST TIME THAT HE RELAPSED INTO HIS EXTRAVAGANCY WAS ABOUT 4 MONTHS SINCE IN A PLACE 12 LEAGUES DISTANT FROM PARIS AND HIS WIFE HEARING OF IT WENT IMMEDIATELY TO HIM TO RE LIEVE HIM SHE SOON SHUT HIM UP AND WAS EVEN CONSTRAINED TO TYE HIM FOR SOME TIME BECAUSE HE WAS IN SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY RAGE AS TO BEAT HER BUT FOR ALL HER CARE ONE TIME HE GOT LOOSE STARK NAKED AND RAN AWAY STREIGHT FOR PARIS NO BODY KNOWING HOW HE COULD FIND HIS WAY IN THE DARK NIGHT HIS WIFE HAD HIM SEARCHED FOR IN ALL THE NEIGHBOURING VILLAGES WHILST HE RAN HERE IN PARIS UP AND DOWN THE STREETS WITHOUT FINDING ANY PLACE TO RETIRE TO IN REGARD THAT THOSE WHO HAD THE CHARITY OF RE CEIVING HIM INTO THEIR HOUSES THE FIRST DAYS KNEW VERY WELL THE DANGER THEY WERE INOF HAVING THEIR HOUSES BURNT OVER THEIR HEADS HE WAS NOT LESS OUTRAGIOUS IN THIS LAST FIT THAN IN THE FORMER HE HATH SPENT 3 OR 4 MONTHS WITHOUT SLEEP AND HIS GREATEST DI VERTISEMENT DURING THAT TIME WAS TO TEAR THE CLOTHES THAT WERE GIVEN HIM TO RUN NAKED ABROAD AND TO BURN IN THE HOUSES WHERE HE WAS WHATEVER HE COULD MEET WITH HE MOVD TO COMPASSION ALL GOOD PEOPLE THAT SAW HIM AND ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE MARAIS DU TEMPLE WHERE HE WAS KNOWN TO MOST AND WHERE HE HAD BEEN WONT TO BE SEEN BEFORE THIS DISTEMPER AS WELL CLOATHED AND FA SHIONED AS ANY ONE OF HIS CONDITION COULD BE MONSIEUR DE MONTMOR AMONG OTHERS WAS THE PERSON MOST TOUCHED WITH IT AND RESOLVED TO EMPLOY HIS INTEREST TO PROCURE HIM A PLACE IN ONE OF THE HOSPITALS BUT FIRST HE THOUGHT ON THE TRANSFUSION AND BELIEVED THERE WOULD BE NO DANGER IN TRYING IT UPON THIS MAN BEING SO PERSUADED BY MANY EXPERIMENTS WE HAD ALREADY MADE IN HIS PRESENCE HE THEREFORE HAD BEEN TAKEN UP FOR THAT END AND HAVING SENT FOR ME AND M EMMEREZ TO ASK OUR620 OUR OPINION OF THE FITNESS OF TRYING THE TRANSFUSION UPON THIS MAN WE ANSWERD THAT WE COULD INDEED GIVE GOOD ASSURANCE FOR HIS LIFE AND THAT THIS OPERATION WAS IN IT SELF NOT CAPABLE TO CAUSE THE DEATH OF ANY ONE IF DISCREETLY MANAGED BUT AS TO THE CURE OF SUCH AN EXTRAVAGANCE AS THAT APPEARED TO US WE HAD NOT YET EXPERIENCE ENOUGH TO DARE TO PROMISE HIM THAT AND THAT OUR CONJECTURES WENT NO FARTHER THAN TO THINK THAT THE BLOOD OF A CALF BY ITS MILDNESS AND FRESHNESS MIGHT POSSIBLY ALLAY THE HEAT AND EBULLITION OF HIS BLOOD BEING MIXED THEREWITH THE MATTER HAVING BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXAMINED WE RESOLVD TO CARRY THIS MAN INTO A PRIVATE HOUSE AND THERE WE APPOINTED FOR HIS GARDIAN THAT PORTER ON WHOM WE HAD ALREADY PRACTISED THE TRANSFUSION 8 MONTHS AGO BOTH THAT THE THING MIGHT NOT AP PEAR SO NEW TO HIM AS IT MIGHT DO TO OTHERS THAT NEVER HAD SEEN THE EXPERIMENT BEFORE AND THAT HE MIGHT SERVE US THE MORE TO ASSURE OUR PATIENT AND OTHERS WHO SHOULD BE PRESENT AT THE OPERATION THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER IN IT AT ALL DECEMB 19 WE USED WHAT ART WE COULD TO DISPOSE THE FANCY OF OUR PATIENT TO SUFFER THE TRANSFUSION WHICH WE RESOLVD SHOULD BE TRIED UPON HIM THAT NIGHT ABOUT 6 A CLOCK MANY PERSONS OF QUALITY WERE PRESENT TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL PHYSICIANS AND CHIRURGEONS TOO INTELLIGENT TO SUSPECT THEM OF BEING CAPA BLE OF THE LEAST SURPRISE M EMMEREZ OPEND THE CRURAL ARTERY OF A CALF AND DID ALL THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS IN THEIR PRESENCE AND AFTER HE HAD DRAWN FROM THE PATIENT ABOUT 10 OUNCES OF BLOOD OUT OF A VEIN OF THE RIGHT ARM WE COULD GIVE HIM NO MORE AGAIN THAN ABOUT 5 OR 6 OUNCES OF THAT OF THE CALF BY REA SON THAT HIS CONSTRAINED POSTURE AND THE CROWD OF THE SPECTATORS INTERRUPTED VERY MUCH THIS OPERATION MEAN TIME HE FOUND HIMSELF AS HE SAID VERY HOT ALL ALONG HIS ARM AND UNDER THE ARMPITS AND PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS FALLING INTO A SWOON WE PRESENTLY STOPPED THE BLOOD RUNNING IN AND CLOSED UP THE WOUND YET HE SUPPED TWO HOURS AFTER AND NOTWITHSTANDING SOME DULNESS AND SLEEPINESS HE WAS IN NOW AND THEN HE YET PASSED THAT NIGHT WITH SINGING WHISTLING AND OTHER EXTRAVAGANCIES USUAL WITH HIM BUT YET NEXT MORNING WE FOUND HIM SOMEWHAT LESS EXORBITANT BOTH IN HIS ACTIONS AND WORDS AND THAT INDUCED US TO BELIEVE THAT621 THAT BY REITERATING THE TRANSFUSION ONCE OR TWICE WE MIGHT FIND A MORE REMARKABLE CHANGE IN HIM WE THEREFORE PREPARD OUR SELVES TO REPEAT IT UPON HIM THE NEXT WEDNESDAY AT 6 A CLOCK IN THE EVENING AGAIN IN THE PRE SENCE ALSO OF SEVERAL VERY ABLE PHYSICIANSBOURDELOTLALLIERDODARDE BOURGES AND VAILLANT BUT IN REGARD THAT THIS MAN APPEARD VERY THIN AND THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL PROBABLE THAT HIS BLOOD WAS PECCANT IN THE QUANTITY AFTER THREE OR FOUR MONTHS CONTINUAL WATCHING AND AFTER THE HUNGER AND COLD HE HAD SUFFERD IN RUNNING NAKED IN THE STREETS WITHOUT FINDING HARBOUR AT NIGHTSWE TOOK BUT TWO OR THREE OUNCES OF BLOOD FROM HIMAND HAVING PUT HIM INTO A MORE CONVENIENT POSTURE WE MADE THIS SECOND TRANSFUSION INTO HIS LEFT ARM MORE PLENTIFUL THAN THE FIRST FOR CONSIDERING THE BLOOD RE MAINING IN THE CALF AFTER THE OPERATION THE PATIENT MUST HAVE RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE WHOLE POUND AS THIS SECOND TRANSFUSION WAS LARGER SO WERE THE EFFECTS OF IT QUICKER AND MORE CONSIDERABLE AS SOON AS THE BLOOD BEGAN TO ENTER INTO HIS VEINS HE FELT THE LIKE HEAT ALONG HIS ARMAND UNDER HIS ARM PITSWHICH HE HAD FELT BEFORE HIS PULSE ROSE PRESENTLY AND SOON AFTER WE OBSERVD A PLENTIFUL SWEAT OVER ALL HIS FACE HIS PULSE VARIED EXTREAMLY AT THIS INSTANT AND HE COMPLAIND OF GREAT PAINS IN HIS KIDNEYS AND THAT HE WAS NOT WELL IN HIS STOMACH AND THAT HE WAS READY TO CHOAK UNLESS THEY GAVE HIM HIS LIBERTY PRESENTLY THE PIPE WAS TAKEN OUT THAT CONVEYD THE BLOOD INTO HIS VEINS AND WHILST WE WERE CLOSING THE WOUND HE VOMITED STORE OF BACON AND FAT HE HAD EATEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE FOUND HIMSELF URGED TO URINE AND ASKED TO GO TO STOOL HE WAS SOON MADE TO LIE DOWN AND AFTER TWO GOOD HOURS STRAININGS TO VOID DIVERS LIQUORS WHICH DISTURBED HIS STOMACHHE FELL ASLEEP ABOUT 10 A CLOCKAND SLEPT ALL THAT NIGHT WITHOUT AWAKENING TILL NEXT MORNING WAS THURSDAY ABOUT 8 A CLOCK WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SHEWED A SURPRISING CALMNESS AND A GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND IN EXPRESSING ALL THE PAINS AND A GENERAL LASSITUDE HE FELT IN ALL HIS LIMBS HE MADE A GREAT GLASS FULL OF URINE OF A COLOUR AS BLACK AS IF IT HAD BEEN MIXED WITH THE SOOT OF CHIMNEYS HEARING OF SOME OF THE COMPANY THAT WE WERE IN A TIME OF JUBILEE HE ASKED FOR A CONFESSOR TO DISPOSE HIMSELF TO BE MADE PARTICIPANT OF IT AND HE CONFESSED HIMSELF ACCORDING TO M DE VEAU WITH THAT EXACTNESS THAT THE CONFESSOR GAVE HIM THE PUBLICK TESTIMONY OF A SOUND UNDERSTANDING AND EVEN JUDGED HIM CAPABLE TO RECEIVE THE SACRAMENT IF HE CONTINUED IN THAT STATE AND DEVOTION HE REMAINED SLEEPY ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY SPAKE LITTLE AND PRAYED THOSE THAT CAME TO IMPORTUNE HIM WITH INTERROGATORIES TO GIVE HIM REST AND HE WENT ON TO SLEEP WELL ALSO THE WHOLE NIGHT FOLLOWING FRIDAY MOR NING HE FILLED ANOTHER URINAL WITH HIS WATER ALMOST AS BLACK AS THAT OF THE DAY BEFORE HE BLED AT THE NOSE VERY PLENTIFULLY AND THEREFORE WE THOUGHT IT PROPER TO TAKE TWO OR THREE SMALL PORRINGERS OF BLOOD FROM HIM V V V SATURDAY622 SATURDAY MORNING THE LAST DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS HE DESIRED AGAIN TO GO TO CONFESS AND SO TO DISPOSE HIMSELF FOR THE COMMUNION THEN ONE MR BONNET EXAMINED HIM IN HEARING HIM CONFESS AND AFTER HE HAD FOUND HIM TO HAVE ALL THE REASON NECESSARY TO RECEIVE THE SACRAMENT HE PRESENTLY GAVE HIM THE COMMUNION THE SAME DAY HIS URINE CLEARD UP AND AFTER THAT TIME IT RESUMED BY LITTLE AND LITTLE ITS NATURAL COLOUR HIS WIFE MEAN TIMETHAT HAD SOUGHT HIM FROM TOWN TO TOWNCAME TO PARIS AND HAVING FOUND HIM OUT WHEN HE SAW HER HE SOON EXPRESSED MUCH JOY TO SEE HER AND RELATED TO HER WITH GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND THE SEVERAL ACCIDENTS THAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM RUNNING UP AND DOWN STREETS HOW THE WATCH HAD SEIZED ON HIM ONE NIGHT AND HOW CALVES BLOOD HAD BEEN TRANS FUSED INTO HIS VEINS THIS WOMAN CONFIRMED YET MORE TO US THE GOOD EFFECTS OF THE TRANSFU SION BY ASSURING US THAT AT THE SEASON WE WERE NOW IN HER HUSBAND SHOULD BE OUTRAGIOUS AND VERY MAD AGAINST HER SELF AND THAT INSTEAD OF THE KINDNESS HE SHEWD TO HER AT THIS FULL OF THE MOON HE USED TO DO NOTHING BUT SWEAR AND BEAT HER TIS TRUE THAT COMPARING HIS CALM CONDITION WHEREIN HE NOW WASWITH THAT WHEREIN EVERY BODY HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE THE TRANSFUSION NO MAN SCRUPLED TO SAY THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY RECOVERD YET TO SPEAK THE PLAIN TRUTH I WAS NOT SO WELL SATISFIED AS OTHERS SEEMD TO BE AND I COULD NOT PER SWADE MY SELF THAT HE WAS IN SO GOOD A TEMPER AS TO STOP THERE BUT I WAS INCLIND TO BELIEVE BY SOME THINGS I SAW THAT A THIRD TRANSFUSION MIGHT BE REQUISITE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT THE TWO FORMER HAD BEGUN YET IN DELAYING THE EXECUTION OF THESE THOUGHTS FROM DAY TO DAY WE OB SERVED SO GREAT AN AMENDMENT IN HIS CARRIAGE AND HIS MIND SO CLEARD UP BY LITTLE AND LITTLE THAT HIS WIFE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS HAVING ASSURD US THAT HE WAS RESTORED TO THE SAME STATE HE USED TO BE IN BEFORE HIS PHRENZY WE EN TIRELY QUITTED THAT RESOLUTION I HAVE SEEN HIM ALMOST EVERY DAY SINCE HE HATH EXPRESSED TO ME ALL MANNER OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND BEEN ALSO WITH M DE MONTMOR THANKING HIM VERY CIVILLY FOR HIS GOODNESS IN RECOVERING HIM OUT OF THAT MISERABLE CONDITION HE WAS IN BY A REMEDY WHICH HE SHOULD REMEMBER AS LONG AS HE LIVED HE IS AT PRESENT OF A VERY CALM SPIRITPERFORMS ALL HIS FUNCTIONS VERY WELL AND SLEEPS ALL NIGHT LONG WITHOUT INTERRUPTION THOUGH HE FAITH HE HATH NOW AND THEN TROUBLESOM DREAMS HE HATH CARRIED HIMSELF SO DISCREETLY IN SOME VISITS HE MADE THIS WEEK THAT DIVERS PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PERSONS WORTHY OF CREDIT THAT HAVE SEEN HIM CAN RENDER AN AUTHENTICK TESTIMONY TO ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES HERE ADVANCED BY ME WHO SHALL NOT EMPLOY AGAINST CAVILS AND CONTRADICTIONS ANY OTHER ARGUMENTS THAN THE EXPERIMENT IT SELF THE LAST YEAR I PUBLISHED MY CONJECTURES AND MY REASONS OF ALL THOSE THAT HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO COMBATE THEM THERE IS NOT ONE THAT HATH SO MUCH AS TOUCHED THE STATE OF THE QUESTION AND THIS HATH MADE ME SILENT TO THEM ALL I HAVE CONSINED MY SELF TO THE EXPERIMENTS ALONE THIS WHEREOF I NOW FEND623 SEND YOU THE PARTICULARS WILL PERHAPS OPEN THE EYES TO SOME THAT ARE OPI NIONATEDI WOULD NOT RELATE THE STORY BUT VERY PLAINLYWITHOUT EMBARASSING IT BY ANY RATIOCINATIONS NOT BUT THAT THERE WAS GOOD MATTER TO DISCOURSE UPONBOTH DURING THE TIME OF THE TRANSFUSIONAND AFTER IT SOME BELIEVED THAT THE VOMITING CAME FROM THE EATING MUCH BACON HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE OPERATION OTHERS CONSIDERING THE PAIN IN HIS KIDNEYS DURING THE TRANSFUSION AND THE SWELLING OF HIS STOMACHWHICH WAS PRESENTLY FOLLOWD BY EVACUATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW DO BELIEVE THAT THE NEW BLOOD ENTRING IN GREAT QUANTITY CAUSED A PLENITUDE AND A FERMENTATION IN THE GREAT VESSELS WHICH COULD NOT BUT BE FOLLOWD BY ALL THOSE EFFECTS TO WHICH MAY BE ADDED THAT ALMOST ALL THOSE INTO WHOSE VEINS OTHER LIQUORS THAN BLOOD HAVE BEEN INJECTED HAVE FOUND THE SAME ACCIDENTS IT IS ALSO NOT YET AGREED ON WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LASSITUDETHAT OBLI GED THIS MAN TO KEEP HIS BED FOR SOME WHOLE DAYS SOME SAY IT PROCEEDED FROM THE DISORDER CONSEQUENT TO THE ENTRY OF NEW BLOOD INTO HIS VEINS OTHERS HAVE LOOKD UPON IT AS THE EFFECT OF A KIND OF RHUMATISM HE HAD GOT LYING STARK NAKED IN THE STREETS AND HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE BECAME NOT SENSIBLE OF THOSE PAINS BUT AFTER THE RECOVERY OF HIS REASON JUST AS THOSE THAT HAVE A HOT FEAVER DO NEVER COMPLAIN OF WEARINESS BUT AFTER THE ABATC MENT OF THE FIT THERE HATH ALSO BEEN VERY DIFFERING DISCOURSE OF THAT BLACK COLOUR IN HIS URINE SOME DAYS AFTER THE TRANSFUSION SOME ALLEDGING THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY SOME VEINS WHICH HAVING BEEN OPENED FROM TOO GREAT A FULNESS DIS CHARGED THEMSELVES INTO THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER OTHERS BELIEVING THAT IT WAS A BLACK CHOLER DISCHARGING IT SELF BY THE VEINS AND WHICH BEING RE TAIND BEFORE SENT UP VAPOURS TO THE BRAIN CAPABLE TO TROUBLE THE FUNCTIONS THEREOF I SHALL HERE SUSPEND MY JUDGMENT RESOLVED NOT TO DECLARE MY THOUGHTS TILL I HAVE MADE MANY EXPERIMENTS MORE FOR I KNOW VERY WELLTHAT IN 50 WE HAVE MADE UPON BRUTES WE HAVE FOUND IT BUT TWICE THAT THE RECIPIENT ANIMAL PISSED BLOOD AFTER IT AND AS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE I BELIEVE I HAVE INFALLIBLE WAYS OF PREVENTING ALL SUCH DISORDERS AND I HAVE PROPOSED TO MY SELF A MANNER OF PREPARATION AND TREATMENT WHICH THE PATIENT MAY BE MADE TO OBSERVE BOTH BEFORE AND DURING THE OPERATION TO RENDER IT MORE BENEFICIAL FOR TIS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT MEASURES ARE TO BE TAKEN TO DIS POSE THE BODY FOR TRANSFUSION AS WELL AS FOR ALL OTHER OPERATIONS TO BE UN DERTAKEN WITH SUCCESS BUT WE NEED NOT REPENT FOR NOT HAVING OBSERVED THEM IN THIS CASE IT APPEARED MUCH BETTER WHAT THE TRANSFUSION ALL ALONE COULD DO AND NO CAUSE HATH BEEN GIVEN TO PREJUDICED MEN TO IMPUTE THIS CURE TO THE PREPARATION RATHER THAN TO THE OPERATION IT SELF WE HEAR OF MANY OTHER SICK PERSONS WHO POSSIBLY MAY FIND RELIEF FROM THIS EXPERIMENT I SHALL NOT FAIL TO LET YOU KNOW THE SUCCESS OF IT IN GOOD TIME V V V 2 AN

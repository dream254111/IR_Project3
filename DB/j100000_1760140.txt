the money question Mr Bowker is explicit but not as em phatic as we could wish in pointing out the evils attendant upon the continuance of the present silvercoinage policy of the United States Per haps however he did not feel justified in introdu cing too much polemical matter into an expository treatise On p 236 the author touches on a point which we believe to be of great importance because it is an illusion which is very generally cherished that is the mistaking unproductive consumption for productive consumption Nine persons out of ten seem to think that the people in general are benefited when a millionnaire spends large sums of money in flowers laces and so forth arguing that in such ways more money is put in circula tion Mr Bowker says truly that  the wealth thus wasted would more wisely used furnish capital to many more people in creating more wealth But he should have fully illustrated this point using examples similar to those of Mill and Fawcett in treating this same topic A chapter on this head would not have been out of place and then a large supply of marked copies of the book might have been productively consumed by mailing them to our national and state legislators and to a select list of popular orators on economic subjects We like particularly the final chapter in this book entitled  The end of the whole mat ter in which the author makes plain the truths that wealth is not an end in itself and that eco nomics is subordinate to ethics The following passage too is very clear and puts the question as to the limits of state interference on what we conceive to be the proper basis   When the social machinery grinds out injustice abuses men makes the rich richer and the poor poorer the community practically will not accept the ex treme laissez faire theory it will not let ill enough alone but will apply factory acts to right wrongs The evils that society has done society must undo On the other hand the common sense also rejects not only the impossible com munism which would reduce the industrious and the idle to a common level but also the socialism which would put the greater portion of the social work under control of the state instead of leaving it to individuals Between the two lies the ac tual working social system varying among differ ent peoples and at different times but persistently in accord with the underlying economic laws and never for any considerable time in any stable state against them This is controlled always by public opinion the aggregate of individual in telligences in its turn directed by education and 617 by the mastery of leadership And thus the pro motion of economic progress resolves itself into the work of political education  pp 262 263 It is well that Mr Bowker has put in his sub title  for use in business  for it is a peculiar yet true fact that most businessmen though they use the terms  capital  price  value  money  rent profits and so on every hour of their working lives have very confused ideas as to what they mean and imply A plain mans talk on the labor question By SIMON NEW COMB New York Harper 1886 16 Professor Newcombs recently published talks also come under the head of economics for the people though the subject treated is but one of the many touched on by Mr Bowker We should say that the chief fault to be found with this book is that the style is almost too conversational and too familiar for dignity The talks were originally published in the Independent and from their sim plicity and directness attracted much attention Advanced political economists and erudite writers on society and its phases may sneer at Professor Newcombs bluntness and homely illustrations but the ordinary reader will see their force The illustration for example on pp 44 45 would be possibly unpleasant though profitable reading for  walking delegates Chapter xv entitled  An other talk to a knight of labor is excellent and can be safely recommended not only to members of that secret organization but to others who find much to admire and little to criticise in its platform of principles On p 180 and the follow ing pages Professor Newcomb disposes very neat ly of the fallacy that waste creates wealth but whether Mr Powderly will break any fewer gingerale bottles in consequence of his perusal of it remains to be seen CREMONAS PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY PROFESSOR CREMONAS new work on projective geometry makes an attractive appearance in its English dress The characteristically English additions of the translator together with the fact that the author himself has striven to imitate the English models for which he professes great ad miration have had the effect to make the book quite indistinguishable were it not for the title page from a book of purely English origin The volume before us has the common defect of not throwing sufficient illumination upon the great central points of the theory which it constructs and of giving too much space and too large type to unimportant details Another de The elements of projective geometry By LUIGI CREMONA Tr by Charles Leudesdorf Oxford Clarendon pr 1885 8 DECEMBER 24 1886618 SCI fect is that there are hardly any examples left for the student to do by himself Half the advan tage of a course of mathematical study is lost if some facility in doing work of the same kind has not been acquired and facility cannot be ac quired without long hours of practice any more than one learns to play the piano by listening to another persons playing Professor Cremona objects to the rather more common name of modern geometry for the sub ject he is treating that it expresses merely a relative idea and that although the methods may be regarded as modern yet the matter is to a great extent old Neither objection seems to us very forcible The characteristic of the modern geometry is its method and not its matter and the distinction between an ancient and a modern world has not yet ceased to have a real signifi cance In all essential respects the distinguished author has accomplished his selfappointed task in an admirable manner and Englishspeaking students will be very grateful to him for his labors The presentation of the subject is admirably lucid and clear the order is well chosen and there are many simplifications of the more laborious pro cesses of Steiner and Von Staudt It is a good plan to make use of M Ed Dewulfs proof of the proposition that lines joining corresponding points of two projective ranges envelop a conic but it is a mistake to let the proof of the most important proposition in the whole book rest upon one of the few passages which are printed in smaller type The extent to which the subject is devel oped may be gathered from the facts that the sheaf of conics through four points is not reached and that the existence of sixty Pascal lines is only mentioned in a footnote ARROWSMITHS EDITION OF KAEGIS RIG VEDA SANSCRIT scholars and those who are familiar with the value of Professor Kaegis  Der Rigveda die ilteste literatur der Inder will be pleased at any attempt to throw the work into a form that will give it a larger circulation and at the same time increase the interest in Vedic studies by bringing an introduction to them within the reach of general readers As contributing to this end Dr Arrowsmiths translation of the German edi tion will be welcomed since to quote from the preface it places  at the command of English readers interested in the study of the Veda a com prehensive and at the same time condensed manu al of Vedic research The Rigveda the oldest literature ef the Indians By ADOLF KAEGI Authorized translation with additions to the notes by R Arrowsmith PhD Boston Ginn 1886 7NCE VOL VIII No 20O This is the end which the translation has in view and it is from a popular standpoint as ap pealing to English readers that this new piece of work must be judged In preparing the transla tion Dr Arrowsmith has chosen to follow the author throughout and no claim is made to originality of thought or treatment or to the con tribution of any specially new material for the elucidation of the Veda Bearing this in mind it must be said that the translation as a rule is excellently made and it would perhaps be hyper critical to pick out the few passages in which the English is not as finished as it miht be or where we have perhaps too close an imitation of the German idiom or word order In the metrical quotations from the hymns themselves the translator although having the Sanscrit text constantly before him has generally adhered as he says closely to Dr Kaegi s render ings and the design seems to have been to give a readable version in popular form rather than always a strictly scientific translation of the San scrit Such being the case we cannot look to these renderings for any thing original but they carry out well enough the plan proposed The additions to the notes consist chiefly in a number of references to the more recent literature on the subject thus bringing the book up to date  and though hy no means complete nor even pro fessing to be so they will prove very welcome and useful The introduction of the  Frog song on p 81 is a good idea and makes an acceptable ad dition to the book It may be noted in passing that an improvement has been made by inserting at the end of each metrical translation the nu merical reference to the mandala and sitkta from which the various verses are taken instead of re serving such references for the notes This will prove much more convenient in a general reading of the book The form in which the book is presented is at tractive but it is to be regretted that numerous mistakes should have crept in not only in the Greek and Latin quotations and in the translitera tion from the Sanscrit but even in the English portions of the work These we shall hope to see corrected in a future edition in order that they may not mar what is otherwise admirable in form In conclusion we may say that by others beside the student of Sanscrit this book will be found in teresting and instructive  and with the exceptioni of the notes even the general reader will be in terested in its perusal It will also it is hoped render somewhat more general a knowledge of the Veda and at the same time increase the interest now taken in oriental studies A V WILLIAMS JACKSON

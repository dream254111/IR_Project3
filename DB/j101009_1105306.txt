Virginia act Under the rule of the common law either assumption of risk or contributory negligence on the part of an employee was a complete defense to an action to recover damages for injuries received For this reason they have often been referred to and discussed by the courts without making any discrimination be tween them But to give full effect to such a statute as this which permits contributory negligence as a partial defense only and assumption of risk as a complete defense in cases where applicable a distinction must necessarily be recognized DISTINCTION BETWEEN ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE Assumption of risk sometimes shades into negligence as com monly understood there is nevertheless a practical and clear distinction between the two In the absence of statute taking away the defense or such obvious dangers that no rdimarily prudent person would incur them an employee is held to assume the risk of the ordinary dangers of the occupation into which he is about to enter and also those risks and dangers which are known or are so plainly observable that the employee may be presumed to know of them and if he continues in the masters employ without objection he takes upon himself the risk of in jury from such defects Contributory negligence on the other tory negligence shall not bar a recovery but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence at tributable to such employee Provided That no such employee who may be injured or killed shall be held to have been guilty of con tributory negligence in any case where the violation by such tom mon carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees con trlbuted to the injury or death of such employee Section 4 That in any action brought against any common car rier under or by virtue of any of the provisions of this Act to re cover damages for injuries to or the death of any of its employees such employee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment in any case where the violation by such common car rier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee 562  DEc1916  ASSUMED RISK AND CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE hand is the omission of the employee to use those precautions for his own safety which ordinary prudence requires3 In Seaboard Air Line Railway v Horton 223 U S 492 28 L Ed 1062 34 S Ct 635 639 L R A 1915C 1 Ann Cas 1915B 475 the court said The distinction although simple is sometimes overlooked Contributory negligence involves the notion of some fault or breach of duty on the part of the employee and since it is ordinarily his duty to take some precaution for his own safety when engaged in a hazardous occupation contributory negligence is sometimes defined as a failure to use such care for his safety as ordinarily prudent employees in similar cir cumstances would use On the other hand the assumption of risk even though the risk be obvious may be free from any suggestion of fault or negligence on the part of the em ployee The risks may be present notwithstanding the ex ercise of all reasonable care on his part Some employments are necessarily fraught with danger to the workmandan ger that must be and is confronted in the line of his duty Such dangers as are normally and necessarily incident to the occupation are presumably taken into the account in fixing the rate of wages And a workman of mature years is taken to assume risks of this sort whether he is actually aware of them or not But risks of another sort not naturally inci dent to the occupation may arise out of the failure of the employer to exercise due care with respect to providing a safe place of work and suitable and safe appliances for the work These the employee is not treated as assuming until he becomes aware of the defect or disrepair and of the risk arising from it unless defect and risk alike are so obvious that an ordinarily prudent person under the circumstances would have observed and appreciated them These distinc tions have been recognized and applied in numerous decisions of this court    When the employee does know of the defect and appreciates the risk that is attributable to it 3 Distinction between contributory negligence and assumption of riskSchlemmer v Buffalo etc R Co 220 U S 590 55 L Ed 596 31 S Ct 561 Assumption of risk is a doctrine wholly distinguishable from that of contributory negligence which is a breach of a legal duty im posed by law upon the servant however unwilling or protesting he may be while assumption of risk is not a duty but is merely volun tary on the part of the servant Southern R Co v Jacobs 116 Va 189 81 S E 99 5632 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S then if he continues in the employment without objection or without obtaining from the employer or his representa tive an assurance that the defect will be remedied the em ployee assumes the risk even though it arise out of the mas ters breach of duty If however there be a promise of reparation then during such time as may be reasonably re quired for its performance or until the particular time spec ified for its performance the employee relying upon the promise does not assume the risk unless at least the danger be so imminent that no ordinarily prudent man under the cir cumstances would rely upon such promise This case was reversed and remanded for a failure to charge that if the plaintiff with knowledge that the water gauge of a locomotive boiler was not provided with a guard glass and the condition was open and obvious and was fully known to the plain tiff and he continued to use such guage with such knowledge and without objection and that he knew the risk incident thereto then he voluntarily assumed the risk and could not recover but charged that the same facts constituted contributory negligence4 In Southern Ry Co v Jacobs5 it was contended that a fire man of an engine who knew of the custom of depositing cinders between the tracks knew of their existence and who was in jured when attempting to mount an engine with a vessel of water in his hands holding not over a gallon was not guilty of as sumption of risk defeating a recovery but only of contributory negligence But it was held otherwise in view of the fact that the employee had full knowledge of the situation and he could 4 Seaboard Air Line Railway v Horton 233 U S 492 58 L Ed 1062 34 S Ct 635 L R A 1915C 1 Ann Cas 1915B 475 Assumption of risk is not shown where a railroad engineer pro ceeding with his engine on a lead track approached or was traversing a railroad yard noticing some loaded cars on the opposite side visi ble to him but becoming more and more shut off as the train pro ceeded inquired of the fireman who was on the same side as the cars and in full view whether they were clear of the track and was told that they were Again later asking the fireman if they were clear he replied that they were not and jumped from the engine The engineer then shut off the power and stepped to the left side of the engine where he was injured and which caused his death This shows contributory negligence but not assumption of risk Yazoo etc R Co v Wright 235 U S 376 59 L Ed 277 35 S Ct 130 5 241 U S 239 36 S Ct 588 affirming 116 Va 189 81 S E 99 564  DEC1916  ASSUMED RISK AND CONTRIBUTORY NtGLIGENCE not be considered as not having appreciated the danger from the cinder piles because he had forgotten their existence at the time and did not notice them Whether an employee may be charged with assumed risk or contributory negligence by continuing in his employment in re liance upon a promise to repair in the presence of a danger so imminent that no reasonably prudent person would confront it is a question upon which the courts differ In Seaboard etc Railroad v Horton6 the question was not decided because it was held that as the court below had charged that it constituted assumption of risk which was more favorable to defendant than if it had charged that it was contributory negligence therefore if error was one of which it could not complain The Virginia decisions hold that under such circumstances an employee assumes the risk7 In Riverside etc Cotton Mills Co v Carter 113 Va 346 74 S E 183 184 the court said A servant may rely upon the promise of the master to repair defects for a reasonable time but if he remains in the serv ice after the expiration of a reasonable time for remedying the defects he is thereby deemed to have waived his objec tion and assumed the risk The question for the jury to de termine is not so much whether the repairs were made within a reasonable time as it is whether the time which elapsed between the promise to repair and the injury was sufficient to put the plaintiff upon notice that the defendant did not intend to make the repairs thereby shifting again to the plaintiff the risk which the master assumed when he made the promise    So far as advised this precise ques tion has not been directly passed upon by this court In the case however of Wheel Co v Chalkley 98 Va 6268 34 S E 976 978 the court says Where the master promises or gives the servant reasonable ground to infer or believe that the defect will be repaired the servant does not assume the risk of an injury caused thereby within such period of time after the promise or assurance as would be reasonably allowed for its performance The inference from this lan guage is clear that if the servant does remain in the service after the expiration of a reasonable time for the master to 6

the repairs he thereby again assumes the risk which had shifted to the master by reason of his promise OPERATION WHEN STATUTE VIOLATED Before taking up the two subjects as separate defenses it is well to observe the provision that is true to both of them i e that they are not available as a defense in any case where the violation of such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee When a statute is violated contributing to the injury of the employee the effect is to abolish the defense of assumption of risk entirely and the contributory negligence of the employee does not operate to reduce the damages the entire negligence being placed upon the employer But it is not to be understood that the simple violation by the carrier of a statute operates of itself to abolish the defenses As in order to render the master liable the violation must have been proximate cause of the injury so to abolish these defenses the violation must have contributed to the injury8 In Atchison etc R Co v Swearingen 239 U S 339 36 S Ct 121 an employee who was on duty over time while about to do some oiling according to directions fell from the running board of the pilot of his engine and his leg was cut off and though there was evidence of negligence the defendant having pleaded contributory negligence and assumption of risk it was held error for the court to instruct the jury that if they found the defendant was guilty of violating the hours of service act then and in that event you will entirely disregard defend ants pleas of contributory negligence and assumed risk as then the plaintiff can in no way be held to have been guilty of con tributory negligence in going upon the pilot while the engine was moving nor can he in any way be held to have assumed any of the risks ordinarily incident to his work or even open and ap parent to him at the time he was hurt On this point the court said This instruction was excepted to in the presence of the jury but the charge was not modified It was the one instruction 8 Operation when statute violatedAtchison etc R Co v Swearingen 239 U S 339 36 S Ct 121 566  DEc1916  ASSUMED RISK AND CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE specifically directed to the matter of overtime The natural understanding of it by people untrained in the law if not by everybody would be that the unjustified retention of the plaintiff at his work for more than sixteen hours would make the defendant liable whether the retention contributed to the injury or not The statute that excludes the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk in such a case is not the hours of labor act itself but the subsequent Em ployers Liability Act    The latter has that operation only when the breach of the law contributes to the injury    We do not think it possible to read the absolute language of the instruction as implicitly limited to such a case EFFECT OF ASSUMPTION OF RISK Under the federal statute the defense of assumption of risk is left as at common law regardless of any state statutory modifi cation9 But in an application of the Virginia statute it has not such an extended operation due to  162 in the Construction of 1902 abolishing the fellow servant rule which provides that Knowledge by any such railroad employee injured of the de fective or unsafe character or condition of any machinery ways appliances or structures shall be no defense to an action for in jury caused thereby This provision of the Constitution to gether with  3 of the Act of 1916 operates to confine assump tion of risk in practically every case to risks which are ordinarily incident to the employment and to abolish it in the numerous cases where it has been held to embrace negligence of the em ployer in failing to provide a safe place to work or safe ap pliances when the employee with knowledge of the same con tinues in the employment without notice or complaint to the em ployer PROPORTIONATE RECOVERY FOR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE If the employee is guilty of contributory negligence it does not bar his recovery In such a case the statutory direction is that 9 Seaboard etc R Co v Horton 233 U S 492 58 L Ed 1062 34 S Ct 635 L R A 1915C 1 Am Cas 1915B 475 Southern Ry Co v Jacobs 116 Va 189 81 S E 99 affirmed in 241 U S 229 6 S Ct 588 5672 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee The rule as to proportionate damages permits a recovery even though the negligence of the employee is equal to or greater than that of the defendant company10 or if the defendant was in the slightest degree negligent11 In Pennsylvania Co v Cole 131 C C A 244 214 Fed 498 950 the court said Under this act no degree of negligence on the part of the plaintiff however gross or proximate can as matter of law bar recovery for as said in Norfolk etc R Co v Earnest 229 U S 114 57 L Ed 1096 33 S Ct 654 Ann Cas 1914C 172 the direction that the diminution shall be in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee means that Where the casual negligence is partly attributable to him and partly to the carrier he shall not recover full damages but only a proportional amount bearing the same relation to the full amount as the negli gence attributable to the carrier bears to the entire negli gence attributable to both To say that plaintiffs negligence equals the combined negligence of plaintiff and defendant is impossible The United States Supreme Court in Norfolk etc R Co v Earnest12 and Grand Trunk etc R Co v Lindsayl3 has interpreted this to mean that the defendant is liable if it is guilty of any causative negligence no matter how slight in com parison to that of plaintiff and that the total damages 10 Proportionate recovery for contributory negligence Louisville etc R Co v Wene 121 C C A 245 202 Fed 887 Pennsylvania Co v Cole 131 C C A 244

it is said If no defense was pleaded other than contributory negligence in an action based upon the Federal Liability Act the plaintiff would as a matter of law be entitled to recover a nominal judgment 12 229 U S 114 122 57 L Ed 1096 33 S Ct 654 Ann Cas 1914C 172 13 233 U S 42 47 58 L Ed 838 34 S Ct 581 Ann Cas 1914C 168 568  DEc1916  ASSUMED RISK AND CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE should be proportioned between plaintiff and defendant according to their respective fractions of the total negligence14 Thus it will be seen that under these statutes it is not a question of ma jority of negligence but rather one of proportion Any negligence of the defendant working injury to the plaintiff would therefore entail some damage For illustration let us suppose that both parties were equally negligent in the estimation of the jury and that the actual damages of the defendant were properly assessable at 2000 In such a case the verdict should be for the plaintiff in the sum of 1000 for the reason that his negligence is one half of the sum total of all the negligence of both parties15 Possibly this would be more clearly understood and not so con fusing in its application were the doctrine of comparative negli gence by which name it is often called entirely eliminated as it must be because this is not comparative negligence In compara tive negligence there may be a point in which the negligence of the employee exceeds that of the employer and prevents a recov ery but in proportionate negligence this is never so as a part will never equal or exceed the whole and it is this part of the employees negligence that is to reduce the damages in the pro portion that it bears to the whole negligence True the negligence of the parties is compared but not primarily to determine the damages but to determine the proportion in which the negligence of each contributed to the total injury and damage upon the de termination of which the plaintiffs recovery is to be reduced accordingly 14 New York etc R Co v Niebel 131 C C A 248 214 Fed 952 955 15 Chadwick v OregonWashington R etc Co 74 Ore 19 144 Pac 1165 1169 L R A 1915C 823 In Fogarty v Northern Pac R Co 74 Wash 397 133 Pac 609 the court does not seem to have recognized the rule as above laid down when it is said The cases must therefore be rare in which the court would be justified in saying as a matter of law that the con tributory negligence of the employee so far exceeds the negligence of the employer that the jury would not be justified in returning a verdict in any amount Because it never defeats a recovery as long as it is contributory But negligence of the employee when the sole cause of the injury defeats a recovery but such is not contributory negligence as in sucha case the defendant is not negligent 5692 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S The rule of the Statute is to be followed Thus in reversing the lower court for its failure to give effect to the rule as laid down in the statute and permitting the jury to reduce the amount of damages by whatever amount they thought proper without naming any standard to which their action should conform other thian their own conception of what was reasonable in Seaboard Air Line Railway v Tilghman 237 U S 499 59 L Ed 1069 35 S Ct 653 654 the court said It means and can only mean as this court has held that where the casual negligence is attributable partly to the car rier and partly to the injured employee he shall not recover full damages but only a diminished sum bearing the same relation to the full damages that the negligence attributable to the carrier bears to the negligence attributable to both the purpose being to exclude from the recovery a porportional part of the damages corresponding to the employees contri bution to the total negligence CONTRIBUTOXK NEGLIGENCE AS PROXIMATE CAUSE OF INJURY In order to diminish the recovery the contributory negligence of the plaintiff must have been the proximate cause of his injury 16 and as under the doctrine of last clear chance the plaintiff is not barred of a recovery so under this statute he would not suffer any reduction of damages due to his prior negligence17 The commonlaw principle controlling the right to recover that is that in the negligent act of the defendant must be found the proximate cause of the injury is abrogated in cases coming within the statute and liability is made to depend upon the question whether such negligent act contributed in whole or in part to the injury18 That is if the cause of action is established by showing that the injury resulted in whole or in part from the de 16 Contributory negligence as proximate and sole cause of injury Raines v Southern R Co 169 N C 189 85 S E 294 Carter v Kansas etc R Co Tex Civ

omission by whatever name it may be called is the same act or omission and it is only when such act or omission on the part of the plaintiff is the sole causewhen the defendants act is no part of the causationthat the defendant is free from liability under the act19 In Illinois Cent R Co v Skaggs 240 U S 66 36 S Ct 249 250 the court said It may be taken for granted that the statute does not con template a recovery by an employee for the consequences of action exclusively his own that is where his injury does not result in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers agents or employees of the employing carrier or by reason of any defect or insufficiency due to its negligence in its property or equipment    But on the other hand it cannot be said that there can be no recovery simply because the injured employee participated in the act which caused the injury The proper construction to put upon the word contributed as used necessarily includes the proposition that the negligence of plaintiff cannot in fact merely contribute to an injury unless there be negligence on the part of defendant also contributing thereto neither can the negligence of a plaintiff be the

injury so that there is no negligence of the defendant to which it is contributory nor any negligence of the defendant making it liable as it is only liable for negligence21 Instances in which the

is sent out to watch for trains and warn employees of danger the company and its trainmen have a right to presume that he will not only watch for trains but also for his safety and his failure to do this is his own negligence and he cannot recover of the company for an injury which he received by reason of his neglect unless his presence and peril were discovered by those in charge of the train in time to avoid striking him by the exercise of ordinary care23 The negligence of an employee will bar a recovery where he was riding on a hand car and on rounding a curve perceived a train and from fright jumped from the car and was injured since no other employees acted so and the section foreman had time to pick up the employee and remove his hand car before the train actually came showing that there was no real danger24 Where the deceased was a rear brakeman on a freight train which broke in two his neglect to obey the rules of the company and the signal of the engineer to go back for the purpose of flagging approaching trains is held to be the sole cause of his death when he knew a passenger train was close behind which was not negligently operated25 22 Instances where employee

Peters Ala 69 So 611 614 on rehearing it was held that the defendants negligence in having a rotten floor over which the plaintiff was required to roll coal was not the proxi mate cause of an injury to the plaintiff in attempting to lift a coal buggy out of a hole but that in so doing plaintiffs injury was a result of a subsequent independent act of his own the sole proxi mate cause of his injury This case can hardly be sustained as had the floor been in good condition the buggy would not have fallen 5732 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S On the other hand the following cases have been held to constitute contributory negllgence A railroad fireman injured by the neglect of the engineer to obey a signal and his own contributory negligence in disobeying a rule of the company and recognized practice of the road to see that signals were obeyed or ascertain the reason for their disobedience does not constitute the sole cause of his injury which would defeat a recovery but only contributory negligence diminishing the damages26 Plain tiffs failure to obey an order was not the sole proximate cause of his injury in a collision even though so found by the special verdict of a jury as such finding was a conclusion of law and not a finding of fact when they also found that defendant was guilty of negligence in having insufficient air brakes to enable the plaintiff to control the speed of the train27 The negligence of an employee in walking on the tracks in a yard is not the sole cause of his death when the defendant is negligent in fail ing to display a light on the train or to give a signal by bell or whistle28 The negligence of an employee in going between cars to uncouple them when the automatic couplers refused to work when there was presented other ways to perform the work is not the sole cause of a resulting injury but only con tributory negligence not constituting a defense29 Where an employee signaled an engineer to stop the engine when he ob served that the couplers were not in line and the engineer fail ing to do so he attempted to kick the coupler on the engine so as to meet the coupler on the car and in doing so his foot was crushed the kicking was not the sole cause of the injury as it arose from the failure of the engineer to stop on receiving the signal30 The neglect of an employee to flag a rear train is not in a hole the plaintiff would not have had to lift it out and his in jury would not have resulted So if he was guilty of negligence it was at most contributory 26 Instances held to constitute contributory negligencePennsyl vania Co v

duty of the conductor under certain conditions to apply the angle cock and stop the train It was held that where the conductor failed to perform his duty there might be a recovery for the engineers death although his negligence created the condition which caused his death33 And where the deceased was a fireman and ran into an open switch his failure to observe the danger signal caused by the switch being open and to inform the engineer was not the sole proximate cause of injuries received by going into the switch and colliding with another train standing on it34 The question of whether or not the contributory negligence was a proximate cause of the injury is usually one of fact for the jury35 It cannot be said that an employee in using a water 31 Hadley v Union Pac R Co Neb 156 N W 765

W 638 Counsel for appellee contends that Carter was attempting to per form his duties in a manner prohibited by the rules of the company in making a flying switch that he thus chose an unsafe method for dong his work and for that reason he assumed all the risks incident thereto The rules offered in evidence permit the making of a flying switch when necessary The determination of when it becomes necessary must in the nature of things be left largely to the judgment of the em ployees But if it should be said in this instance that incorporating the car into the train by means of a flying switch was not necessary there is still another complete answer to appellees contention The in jury sustained by Carter was not necessarily a result of making a flying switch He was struck by an open door

show that these were not an entirely safe instrumentality because of their liability to clog and at most the proximate cause of the injury is a question for the jury36 But where the negligence of a railroad company consisted of its failure to furnish a proper drawbar which caused the train to break in two and the employees negligence con sisted in his failure to go back and signal an approaching pas senger train it was not error to direct a judgment notwithstand ing a verdict on the theory that the employees negligence was the proximate cause of the injury and not one of concurrent negligence between himself and the railroad company37 INSTRUCTIONS ON DIMINUTION OF DAMAGES It is not required that damages be assessed under separate issues one as to the full amount sustained and the other as to the amount to be deducted therefrom by the answer to the issue of contributory negligence and where the trial judge has correctly charged the jury in this respect under the one issue of damages there is no error38 When instructing the jury as to the effect of contributory negligence the language of the act is not in itself a sufficient instruction 39 but may not be gine in the ordinary way Louisville etc R Co v Pearson 97 Ala 211 12 So 176 The fact that Carter was injured while making a running switch in violation of the ruleswould be no defense unless it be shown that that method of

instruction given is almost in the identical language of the statute and while definition might have further con duced to an appreciation by the jury of the standard estab lished by the statute we think there was no error in the charge given especially as the railroad company made no request for a charge clarifying any obscurity on the subject which it deemed existed It is true the company made a request on the subject which the court declined to give but that request we are of opinion taken as a whole in stead of clarifying any ambiguity deemed to exist in the instruction which the court gave would have served to obscure it But the jury is not to be permitted to reduce the amount of damages for contributory negligence to such a sum as they may think proper41 The rule to be followed was laid down in Norfolk etc R Co v Earnest229 U S 114 57 L Ed 1096 33 S Ct 654 Ann Cas 1914C 172 where it is said The statutory direction that the diminution shall be in pro portion to the amount of

pro portional amount bearing the same relation to the full amount as the negligence attributable to the carrier bears to the entire negligence attributable to both the purpose being to abrogate the commonlaw rule completely exoner ating the carrier from liability in such a case and to sub stitute a new rule confining the exoneration to a proportional part of the damages corresponding to the

It is the duty of the jury first to determine whether or not the defendant was guilty of causal negligence for if that issue is determined against the plaintiff there can be no recovery If the issue of the defendants negligence is determined in favor of the plaintiff then the jury should consider whether or not he too was guilty of negligence directly contributing to the happening of the accident and if they decide that issue against the plaintiff then looking at the combined negligence of the plaintiff and defendant as a whole and using their best judgment based on the evidence before them the next material subject for the jury to consider is in what ratio should this combined negligence be distributed between the parties to the accident in other words how much or what proportion of the whole blame or fault should be attrib utable to each After this problem is solved the jury must determine the anmount of the damages suffered through the combined negligence and deduct therefrom a proportion corresponding with the share of negligence charged against the plaintiff the balance or a proportion corresponding with the slnare of negligence charged against the defendant to be awarded as damages to the plaintiff We do not mean to say that the method just outlined is the only way in which a jury may proceed to reach its conclusions in the trial of causes involving comparative negligence but rather simply to indicate an orderly manner for considering and determining such cases Also an exemplary instruction on the proportion of damages is found in Gekas v OregonWashington R etc Co 75 Ore 243 146 Pac 970 where The court defined negligence and charged the jury that if they found that the plaintiff was negligent himself and that his own conduct contributed to the injury provided they found that the company was also negligent the plain tiff could not recover full damages but that they should be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the plaintiff as follows So that your ver dict when finally agreed upon will be in proportion to the full compensation as the negligence attributable to defend ant bears to the entire negligence attributable to both plain tiff and the defendant that is to say your first inquiry should be Was the defendant guilty of negligence And your second inquiry should be Was the plaintiff guilty of neg ligence And your third inquiry should be In what de 5792 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S gree did these causal negligences contribute to the accident And I instruct you as a matter of law you must determine what proportion plaintiff contributed to causes that caused the accident If you find plaintiffs negligence contributed to the extent of onethird of the entire negligence then the plaintiffs damages would be reduced to onethird If to the extent of onehalf then his damages would be reduced by onehalf and if to the extent of twothirds then his damages would be reduced by twothirds and if his neg ligence was alone the cause of the accident then of course that would wipe out the damages and your verdict would be in favor of the defendant 42a It is improper to instruct the jury that the damages should be reduced in the proportion that the negligence of the plaintiff com pares to the negligence of the defendant Though such an error was held to have been waived by a failure to point out the defect and that it was not covered by a general objection in Norfolk etc R Co v Earnest 229 U S 114 57 L Ed 1096 33 S Ct 654 Ann Cas 1914C 172 the court said But for the use in the second instance of the additional words as compared with the negligence of the defendant there would be no room for criticism Those words were not happily chosen for to have reflected what the statute con templates they should have read as compared with the combined negligence of himself and the defendant43 42a In Waina v Pennsylvania Co Pa 96 Atl 461 it is said to be better not to illustrate an instruction on the proportion of dam ages but it is not erroneous in telling the jury that in proportioning the negligence it does not mean that if the negligence is equal there shall be no recovery but that in such a case the plaintiff could re cover onehalf and if his negligence was more than half or greater the damages would have to be reduced in proportion 43 Diminution by comparison of negligence of each held

ASSUMED RISK AND CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE Prejudice may not always result from an instruction direct ing a comparison of negligence to ascertain the damages result ing44 As to whether or not the defendant was prejudiced by an instruction on the measure of damages which told the jury that in case they found the plaintiff guilty of contributory neg ligence then such damages should be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to him as compared with the negligence if any attributable to the de fendant in Cross v Chicago etc R Co 191 Mo App 202 177 S W 1127 the court said We cannot say the error was not prejudicial since we have no means of knowing the comparisons of negligence made by the jury Whether this above instruction would be more favorable to defendant or not depends upon the relative amount of negligence the jury charged against the parties For instance suppose the full amount of damages was 2000 and the jury thought the negligence to be charged to the plaintiff should be stated at 2 and the defendants at 8 In that case plaintiffs negligence according to the in struction would be onefourth as much as defendants while according to the correct rule it would be onefifth of the whole damage In that event the instruction would be more favorable to defendant than would the correct rule since if any through other employees should be compared and if the other negligence was greater than his a verdict should be rendered for plaintiff the total actual damages being diminished in proportion to the relative negligence of the two parties Since the case was tried the supreme court in Norfolk etc R Co v Earnest 229 U S 114 57 L Ed 1096 33 S Ct 654 Ann Cas 1914C 172 and Grand Trunk etc R Co v Lindsay 233 U S 42 58 L Ed 838 34 S Ct 581 has interpreted the act to mean that the defendant is liable if through other employees it is guilty of any causative negligence no matter how slight in comparison to that of plaintiff and that the total damages should be proportioned between plaintiff and defendant ac cording to the respective fractions of the total negligence In so far as the interpretation of the statute by the trial judge was not in ac cordance with these later decisions the error was not prejudicial to defendant and affords no ground for reversal New York etc R Co v Niebel 131 C C A 248 214 Fed 952 44 Prejudice

damages 2000 would be diminished by onefourth or 500 leaving plaintiffs verdict to be 1500 while under the correct rule the 2000 would be diminished by onefifth or 400 leaving the verdict 1600 But suppose the jury thought the negligence of the plaintiff was 8 and that of the defendant 2 then under the instruction plaintiffs negligence would be threefourths while according to the correct rule it would be fourfifths In such case under the instruction the 2000 would be diminished by 1500 leaving 500 as the verdict while under the correct rule the 2000 would be diminished by 1600 leaving plaintiffs verdict at only 400 So that it all depends on where the jury places the greater negligence as to whether the instruction as given is favorable or un favorable to defendant Hence we cannot say the instruc tion was harmless DAUNIS MCBRIDE

WE MAY JUSTLY INFER ON IDENTITY OF SPECIES IN FISHES FROM THE LIKENESS OF THEIR FINS WE HAVE THEN SOME GROUND TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS FISH I AM GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF AND WHICH HAS NOT HITHERTO BEEN DESCRIBED BY ANY AS I KNOW OF OUGHT TO BE REFERRED TO THE GURNARD KIND NOT BUT THAT IN MANY PARTICULARS AND THOSE VERY REMAR KABLE TOO IT DIFFERD FROM IT HOWEVER NOT FINDING ANY OTHER SPECIES IT AGREED WITH BETTER AND THE FISHMONGER THAT SENT IT TO THE R S NOT KNOWING ANY NAME TWAS CALLD BY WHERE TAKEN WHICH WAS ABOUT HASTINGS IN SUS SEX I SHALL TAKE LIBERTY TO CALL IT THE YELLOW GURNARD AND THAT I HAD SOME COLOUR OF REASON FOR DOING THIS WILL APPEAR WHEN I HAVE COMPARED THIS FISH WITH THE RED GURNARD AND SHEWN WHEREIN THEY AGREED OR DIFFERD AND FIRST OF ALL AS TO THE GENERAL SHAPE OF THEIR BO DIES I FOUND AN AGREEMENT ENOUGH IN BOTH THE HEAD WAS THE BIGGEST PART THE BODY THENCE GRADUALLY STILL LESSENING AND GROWING TAPERER AS IT APPROACHED THE TAIL WHERE TWAS VERY SMALL IN BOTH THE YELLOW GUR NARD MEASURED ELEVEN INCHES IN LENGTH WHEREOF THE TAIL WAS TWO THE  OF THE HEAD WAS FOUR INCHES AND A HALF N N N N N N N N N N 2 THE1750 THE FINS AS TO NUMBER AND SITUATION OR PLACING ON THE BODY WERE EXACTLY THE SAME IN BOTH I SHALL THERE FORE OMIT THEIR DESCRIPTION AND ONLY TAKE NOTICE WHERE IN THEY DIFFERD IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AS IN THE SORE FIN ON THE BACK OF THE YELLOW GURNARD THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE RADIJ OR SPINES WHEREOF THE FIRST WAS SIX INCHES LONG THE NEXT ABOUT TWO THE OTHERS SHORTER IN THE RED GURNARD IN THIS FIN WERE SIX STRONG BONY SPINES SHARPPOINTED WHEREOF THE SECOND FROM THE HEAD BEING THE LONGEST WAS ONLY A LITTLE ABOVE AN INCH AND THE REST NOT MUCH SHORTER NOTE THE RED GURNARD I HAD TO COMPARE WITH WAS BUT SMALL AND SOMETHING LESSER THAN THE YELLOW ONE IN THE HINDER FIN OF THE BACK OF THE YELLOW GURNARD THERE WERE NINE RADIJ IN THE RED GURNARD FOURTEEN IN BOTH THE RADIJ NEAR THE TAIL WERE THE LONGEST THOSE IN THE YELLOW GURNARD BEING TWO INCHES AND A HALF LONG THE MEMBRANE THAT JOYNED THESE RADIJ OF THE BACK PINS AS TO COLOUR DIFFERD VERY MUCH IN THESE FISHES FOR IN BOTH THE BACK FINS OF THE RED GURNARD THIS MEMBRANE WAS ALL OF A WHITE TRANSPARENT COLOUR IN THE FORE FIN OF THE YELLOW GURNARD THE MEMBRANE WAS YELLOWISH WITH BLUE SPOTS AND SOME EDGED WITH BLACK AND THE MEMBRANE OF THE HINDER FIN WAS OF A FAINT BLUISH COLOUR WITH FOUR YELLOW LISTS OR STREAKS ABOUT A LINE BROAD RUN NING THE WHOLE LENGTH AS IN THE FIGURE THE PINNAE BRONCHIALES WHEREOF THERE WERE TWO OF EACH SIDE AND THEIR SITUATION IN BOTH THE SAME THE UP PERMOST BEING INSERTED PERPENDICULAR THE LOWERMOST HORIZONTAL TO THE BODY DIFFERD LIKEWISE IN COLOUR FOR IN THE YELLOW GURNARD THE UPPERMOST FINS WERE WHITE THE LOWERMOST OF A DARK BLACKISH COLOUR WITH SEVERAL BEAUTIFUL LONG SPOTS OF AN AZURE BLUE IN THE RED GURNARD THE UPPERMOST FINS WERE OF A DARK REDDISH COLOUR THE LOWERMOST WHITE BUT HERE BETWEEN THESE TWO FINS I OB1751 OBSERVED THREE NAKED CARTILAGINOUS RADIJ WHICH ARE NOT IN THE YELLOW GURNARD AND ARE WELL EXPRESSED IN SALVIAE  FIGURE OF THE RED GURNARD THE FIN ON THE BELLY WAS PLACD EXACTLY ALIKE IN BOTH THE YELLOW GURNARD HERE HAD NINE RADIJ AND ITS MEM BRANE OF A DARKISH BLUE COLOUR THE RED GURNARD HAD 17 OR 18 RADIJ HERE AND ITS MEMBRANE TRANSPARENT WHITE THE TAIL IN BOTH WAS MUCH THE SAME OVER THE ANUS IN THE YELLOW GURNARD WAS A SLENDER PENDULOUS BODY WHICH WAS NOT OBSERVED IN THE RED GURNARD THE COLOUR OF THE BODY OF THESE TWO FISHES DIFFERING LIKEWISE VERY MUCH AND I KNOW NOT BUT THAT IT MAY BE A PROPERTY IN THIS SPECIES TO VARY IN COLOURS MORE THAN OTHER FISHES DO THE BELLY OF THE RED GURNARD WAS OF A SILVER COLOUR AND SOME PART OF THE SIDES NEAR THE BELLY THE REST AND THE BACK AND THE HEAD WERE OF A REDDISH COLOUR IN THE HEAD THERE WERE WERE SOME SMALL WHITISH SPOTS THE BELLY OF THE YELLOW GURNARD WAS WHITE BUT UNDER THE LOWER JAW WAS BLACK THE SIDES AND BACK WERE YELLOWISH BUT BETWEEN THE BELLY AND SIDES THERE RAN A BLUE STREAK OR LIST ABOUT A LINE AND A HALF BROAD FROM THE HEAD TO THE TAIL AND A LITTLE HIGHER ON THE SIDES THERE WAS A CHAIN OF BLUE SPOTS THE LENGTH OF THE FISH FOR ON THE SIDES OF THE HEAD I OB SERVED THESE BLUE SPOTS ONLY FROM THE EYES TO THE END OF THE ROSTRUM THE SPOTS WERE OF A DEEP YELLOW COLOUR THERE BEING THEREFORE SO MUCH OF BLUE AND YELLOW O VER THE GREATEST PART OF THE BODY OF THIS FISH I HAVE GIVEN IT THE EPITHET OF CAERULEOFLAVESCENS FOR WHERE THE GROUND IS BLUE THE SPOTS ARE YELLOW AND WHERE YELLOW THE SPOTS ARE BLUE THO HITHERTO THERE SEEMS A TOLERABLE AGREEMENT BE TWEEN THESE TWO FISHES YET IN THE REMARKS I SHALL NOW ADD THE DISAGREEMENT WILL APPEAR GREATER FOR THE YELLOW GURNARD WAS WITHOUT SCALES I THEREFORE CALL IT LAEVIS1752 LAEVIS THE RED GURNARD HAD NOT ONLY SCALES ON THE BACK BUT LIKEWISE A RIDGE OF SPINY SCALES ALL ALONG THE SIDES AS ALSO OF EACH SIDE THE BACK FINS WERE PLACED THE LIKE SPINY RIDGES OR SCALES BUT THE BELLY SEEMED AL MOST SMOOTH AND HAD BUT FEW SCALES AND THOSE VERY FINE AND INDEED THOSE ON THE BACK WERE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE IN MOST OTHER FISHES IF MR LEEWENHOEKS OBSER VATION BE TRUE THAT EVEN THE ANGUILLOUS KIND ARE SCALY THEN THE DIFFERENCE WILL NOT BE SO GREAT THE ONE HAVING MEMBRANULOUS SCALES THE OTHER BONY OR IT MAY BE OUR SUBJECT IS AN INTERMEDIATE SPECIES BETWEEN THE GUR NARD KIND AND SOME OTHER AND THIS I AM THE MORE APT TO BELIEVE BECAUSE THO IT HAS GILLS OF EACH SIDE YET IT HAD NOT THOSE APERTURES AT THE SIDES OF THE HEAD THAT THE RED GURNARD HAD AND IS COMMON TO MOST FISHES BUT THE CTEACEOUS KIND BUT LIKE THEM THE YELLOW GURNARD HAD TWO APERTURES OR LARGE FORAMINAS PLACED ON THE HINDER PART OF THE HEAD AN INCH BEYOND THE EYES AT WHICH IT SPOUTS OUT THE WATER BY BLOWING INTO THESE HOLES I EXTENDED THE CAVITIES WHERE THE GILLS LAY AND OBSERVED THAT OVER THESE CAVITIES WERE PLACED A FLAT BONE WHICH BY THE CONTRACTION OF ITS MUSCLES MIGHT SERVE TO FORCE THE WATER OUT AND PERHAPS IS ASSISTED IN THIS ACTION BY ANOTHER LOOSE BONE THAT LYES OVER IT WHOSE EDGES ARE JAGGED OR IN DENTED AS IN THE FIGURE AT WHICH PLACE IN THE RED GURNARD I OBSERVED A STRONG SHARP SPINE THESE FORAMINA IN THE HEAD OF THIS FISH IS A THING SO VERY REMARKABLE THAT IT MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS A CHA RACTERISTICK NOR DO I KNOW AT PRESENT WITH WHAT OTHER FISH TO PARALLEL IT WITH FOR THE CETACEOUS KIND THAT HAVE SPOUTS IN THEIR HEADS HAVE NOT BRONCHIAE BUT LUNGS THE BETTER THEREFORE TO DISTINGUISH THIS FISH I HAVE AD DED THIS PARTICULAR TO ITS NAME AND COULD WISH THAT INSTEAD OF THOSE SILLY NAMES THAT ARE GIVEN TO MOST FISHES OTHERS WERE FOUND OUT THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPRESSIVE AND1753 AND THAT THEIR CLASSES WERE SO ORDERD BY SUCH SPECIFICK DIFFERENCES THAT ONE MIGHT BETTER KNOW WHERE TO RANGE THEM AS IN A GOOD PERFECTION IS NOW DONE IN THE VEGITA BLE KINGDOM THAT IS MORE NUMEROUS BUT TO CONCLUDE I OBSERVED THE EYES IN THE YELLOW GURNARD WERE PLACED MORE ON THE TOP OF THE HEAD AND THE SKIN HERE COVERED ALMOST HALF OF THEM LIKE AN EYE LID WHICH I DID NOT OBSERVE IN THE RED GURNARD WHOSE EYES WERE PLACED MORE AT THE SIDES OF THE HEAD THE HEAD LIKEWISE OF THE RED GURNARD WAS MORE PROTU BERANT IN THE YELLOW FLATTER THE END OF THE ROSTRUM THE TEETH AND TONGUE IN BOTH WERE EXACTLY ALIKE ONLY IN THE PALAT OF THE YELLOW GURNARD I OBSERVED TWO CAR TALIGONOUS BONES WHOSE EDGES WERE BENDED DOWNWARDS FROM THE PALAT AND DID SERVE AS I SUPPOSED FOR THE HOOKING IN AND STAYING THE CARTILAGE OF THE TONGUE WHEN IT MAKES A COMPRESSION FOR THE FORCING OUT THE WATER BY THE FORAMINA OF THE HEAD WHICH CONTRIVANCE I DID NOT FIND IN THE RED GURNARD NOT HAVING THE LIKE OCCASION FOR THEM THIS FISH BEING STALE I HAD NOT OPPORTUNITY OF DISSECT ING IT AND OBSERVING THE VISCERA AND SHALL ONLY FARTHER ADD THAT THE GILLS HAD FOUR OSSEOUS RADIJ OF EACH SIDE BUT OF THESE MORE IF I HAPPEN TO GET ANOTHER OF THIS SORT VII

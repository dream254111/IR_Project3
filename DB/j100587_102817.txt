Surgeon lately sent me from Fort St George 1 MUsculus Madraspat fluviatilis medius intus ar genteus 1 The largest of these I have yet seen exceed not an inch in breadth and not quite 1 12 in length amongst them I have observed a gradual decrease to about 12 the bigness The Shells are indifferent thick of a dark brown on the outside and silver within 2 Unicornu an Fluviatilisminor Madraspat lineis fus cis undatis 2 This Shell runs very taperand has about 10 twirls the uppermost circled with many fine striae stripd with brown curld lines the lower twirls seem cancellated or latticd I have

from Fort St George 11 Folliculena seu Folliculum Phalenae ovale appen dice annulo terminante e Madraspatan 11 This is a wonderful InsectCase or Coffin formd by some sort of Silk or Cobwebspinning Catterpillar but the Moth from whence it comes I cannot yet learn Its pecu liarity which I have not observed in any other is a pe dicle with a Ring at the end of it thro which this oval Case is fastned to the Branches and Twigs of Trees Shrubs c 12 Capricornus Madraspatanus major humero corni busque spinosis This 12861 This Goatcheffer is 2 inches and 12 long and near one broad on each side his Shoulder is a spine his Vaginae or Sheathwings near this part are sprinkled with little eminencies the Horns about 3 inches long composed of 10 thorny geniculae 13 Scarablatta Madraspat Vaginis punctatis 13 This is of the same shape and species and only differs in being pounct like a Thimble with a Beetle which Moffet p 139 hath given a good Figure of and says its described by Pliny acute cluna which it has and that in Latin its calld Blatta faetida this I have observ ed in Cellars and Vaults but do not find it stinks like the Cockroaches or Blatta navalis nor domestica which are of another Genus I have therefore distinguisht these wingless Beetles under this title 14 Scarablatta Madraspat 6 albis maculis insigniter guttatis 14 This is an elegant Beetle and the more rare being of the unwinged kind like the last of which I have not yet observed above 5 or 6 sorts Its Horns are near an inch long composed of 10 or 12 Corallinelike geniculae as are his feelers of 3 his upper forcipes are strong the mid dle short and small below these are his feeders another pair which serve to carry his food to the upper forcipes or cutters This Insect is remarkably distinguisht from all others by 4 orbicular white spots on his Vaginae and 2 oblong ones on his Shoulder 15 Scarapecten Madraspat niger naso clypeato mo nocerato 15 16 Scarapecten Guineensis niger naso serrato 16 17 Cantharis Madraspat ruber pedibus nigris 17 18 Cantharus exoticus ex nigro aurantioque fasciatus 18 These differ in magnitude I therefore take them to be of the oviparous kind 19 Cantharus minor

heartyFriend Mr Samuel Daniel Surgeon brought me some years since from Smyrna with the next and se veral other very Curious Insects 25 25 Mantis Smyrnea gracilis alis strictioribus 26 26 Bombylus Madraspat nigrescens cruribus plumosis 27 27 Papilio Madraspatanus nigrescens maculis sangui neis pallidisque interspersis 28 28 Papilio Orientalis nigrescens duplici serie maculis sanguineis This differs from the last in having all Scarlet spots in both the rows 29 29 Papilio Madraspat nigrescens maculis rubris bifari am dispositis This is very like the aforegoing except that instead of the upper row of spots they are here in a cluster 30 30 Papilio Orientalis caudatus nigrescens maculis al bis semicirculari This is distinguisht from others in hav ing a row of White Spots thro the middle of the lower wing which to make a Semicircle is continued on the edges of the upper 31 31 Papilio Orientalis nigrescens macularum albarum du plici serie marginatus This on the upper side has only 2 rows of greater and lesser specks along the lower edges but on the other fide each upper Wing has 6 specks and lower 4 out of row 32 32 Papilio Orientalis e fusco  albescentestriis macu lisque mixtus These 3 last Mr James Cuninghame and Mr Charles Perry Surgeons brought me formerly from other parts in the East Indiesand I have since received them from Fort St George N B Most of the foregoing

long life dis tinguished for the prominent enterprises with which he had been connected and to which he had given many features they still retain He was noted for his purity of life and profes sionally for his caution accuracy sound judg ment and integrity His engineering training was not obtained in any technical school such as is offered to the youth of the present day and his preparatory education was extremely moderate in amount John Bloomfield Jervis was born at Hunt ington Long Island Dec 14 1795 and was the oldest of seven children His father was a carpenter who in 1798 removed to the neigh borhood of Rome NY and engaged in saw ing lumber The son attended the common school of that date until he was fifteen years old and for the following seven years he worked at the sawmill on the farm and in the woods In 1817 the construction of the Erie canal through that region brought about his employment as axeman on the work and first turned his attention to engineering He was soon promoted to rodman and in two years was made resident engineer of a section of seventeen miles from Canastota to Limestone Creek He gave such satisfaction that in 1821 he was assigned to a similar position near Am sterdam and was retained after the opening of the canal to superintend repairs A condensed statement of the more impor tant of his professional engagements which are described at greater length in the Railroad gazette of Jan 23 will give an idea of how active and responsible a position in life he has occupied In 1825 he became chief engineer of the Delaware and Iudson canal company and remained until 1830 He constructed the inclines of the Carbondale railroad and or dered from England the C Stourbridge lion the first locomotive imported into this country In 1830 he was made chief engineer of the Albany and Schenectady railroad the first rail NCE VOL v No 112 road constructed in the state of New York and later of the Schenectady and Saratoga railroad Here he devised the fourwheeled swivelling or  pony truck used for the lead ing wheels of a locomotive and generally adopted in this country In 1833 he was chief engineer of the Chenango canal ninetyeight miles in length with a hundred locks where he originated the use of artificial reservoirs for the supply of the summit level In 1835 he made surveys and estimates for an enlarge ment of the eastern section of the Erie canal He was made chief engineer of the Croton aqueduct in 1836 a work considered at the time of its completion as a magnificent exam ple of hydraulic engineering and in which the Croton dam High bridge and the 42dstreet reservoir show his professional skill From 1846 to 1848 he was consulting engineer on the Cochituate aqueduct Boston watersupply Waterworks at Port Jervis and at Rome NY were later constructed under his supervision Between 1847 and 1850 he was first chief and then consulting engineer of the HudsonRiver railroad when it was completed from New York to Poughkeepsie a portion covering most of the difficult work of that line After a short trip to Europe he became chief engineer on the construction of what is now the western part of the Lake shore and Michigan southern rail road and was connected with this road until 1858 During 1851 he was made president of the Chicago and Rock Island railway In 1861 he became general superintendent of the Pitts burgh Fort Wayne and Chicago railway in 1864 was made its chief engineer and in 1866 its consulting engineer  a position he held until 1872 In 1868 he was connected with the organization of the Rome ironmill company and was its secretary from 1872 until his death After retiring fiom active work in the field in 1866 he wrote a book on  Railway prop erty and another on  The question of labor and capital In 1868 the American society of civil engineers elected him an honorary member and in 1878 Hamilton college con ferred on him the degree of LLD Mr Wil  pSCIENCE liam P Shinn in the sketch of his life in the Railroad gazette says  His last professional work and that which most fully illustrates the extraordinary character of his professional ability and the esteem in which he was held by his engineering contemporaries was his employment as a consulting engineer on the proposed new Croton aqueduct    That he should be equal to this work at the age of eightysix was sufficiently remarkable but that he should be considered as worthy of being con sulted by men themselves veterans in the pro fession is a still more extraordinary evidence of the exceptional character of the man 1His health and his faculties remained unim paired till near the close of his life and he died of old age in his ninetieth year THE NEW PALACE AT SOUL SucH is the name of that collection of grounds and buildings in S6ul which is at present the abode of the reigning sovereign of Korea Strictly speaking the title is in both parts a misnomer for the place so called is neither new nor is it exactly what in western parlance would be styled a palace and yet to Korean thought it is both Its age is comparative merely as indeed must be that of every thing which does not contain within itself a term of life In this case the comparison is with what is now known in the same antithesis as the Old Palace But there is also a certain abso lute justice in this last name for the Old Palace could not possibly be any older where it is It is coeval with the beginning of the present state of things dating from the found ing of the city of S6ul now hard upon the fivehundredth anniversary The New Palace was laid out some hundred years later and is therefore about four centuries old at the present time In consequence of being later built it occupies a somewhat less honorable position than the older one for even position has its allotted ceremonial in Korea North east west and souththis is the relative rank of the four cardinal points In etiquette the sovereign always faces the south and his subjects look to the north Following the same rule the post of honor generally olu all occasions of ceremony such as dinners or feasts is at the northern end of the room A singular practice this of determining by exte rior terrestrial phenomena the etiquette of en 251 tertainments carried on within four walls which are themselves in no wise subjected to orienta tion and may face any direction indifferently according to the fancy of the owner When the city of Soul was laid out there fore the palace was given the post of honor the northern end of the space enclosed by the citys wall and when the second palace came to be built it was placed as nearly north as was possible consistently with the position of the older one to whose left reckoned as facing the city it lay Exactly what was the origin of this custom of allotting a rank among themselves to the cardinal points it would be interesting to know We may perhaps look to some rude astronomy for an explanation Like the pyra mids it may in its way be the relic of an old study of the stars Certainly early man could hardly fail to be struck by the sight that while all else in the heavens moved the pole alone remained in dignified repose The Ko reans themselves suggest a more earthly origin for the practice Because the south is the bright the warm and therefore the happy region of the earth they say the king sits so that he may always face it When we call to mind the cold winters of those lands whence the fareastern peoples migrated as well as those to which they afterwards came and now inhabit we realize how instinictive this turning in body as in thought toward the south would naturally be The New Palace was originally built as a residence for the crown prince or to speak more accurately the heir apparent for in Ko rea the heir to the throne is chosen by the king during his life and is not necessarily born to the position though it is customary for his majesty to so designate his eldest son This is no doubt a reason for the superiority archi tecturally of the other the older one But the newer possesses a charm of its own first from the uneven character of the ground over which it rambles and secondly from being much less artificially laid out It is also some what the larger of the two in the extent of ground it covers The high wall which sur rounds it encloses about ten thousand acres In this wall are set gates at various points four teen of them in all There is no symmetry in their arrangement nor is there any in the line of wall itself which meanders about in so aim less a fashion as to cause surprise when at last it ends by meeting itself again The gates or archways are quite as various in size and honor as they are unsymmetrical in position  a fact typified by their names which range through MARCH 27 1885

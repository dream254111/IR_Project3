j100168,Harvard Law Review,1325049,The Concurrent Jurisdiction of the Federal and State Courts,i256946,is given under an erroneous belief of ownership9 goes to show that it is wholly independent of the testators intention10 That it rests on the broad principle that he who seeks equity must do equity seems therefore the preferable view1 Two exceptions to the general rule have been recognized by the courts The first is where a will defectively executed as to lands belonging to the testator contains a valid gift to the heir Before the modern statutes this raised the question of an election by the heir between the legacy and the lands rightfully his by descent When the devise of realty was inoperative because of the Statute of Frauds it was uniformly held that the heir need not elect12 for the courts hesitated to accomplish indirectly by compelling an election a result which the Statute prevented the testators accomplish ing directly they therefore refused to look at the will for the purpose of raising an election Like considerations were applicable where the will was ineffectual to dispose of afteracquired land yet in such a case the heir was put to his election13 And in a situation possible at the present time as well as under early statutes namely where the devise was inoperative be cause the lands in question were situated in a foreign jurisdiction a like result was reached14 The second exception was made in the case of the will of an infant Be cause of the testators incapacity such an instrument inoperative under the early law as to land but valid as to a gift of personalty was regarded as insufficient to put the heir to his electionl5 On the ground that there must always be personal competency a leading writer brings within this excep tion the will of a married woman16 But his view finds little supportl7 However it may have been in former times under modem statutes giving married women full power to acquire hold and dispose of property there is no reason not to apply the general rule of election Accordingly where under the English Married Womens Property Act18 a married woman bequeathed to a stranger property belonging to her husband and in the same will left the husband an annuity from her separate estate the husband was compelled to elect In re Harris I909 2 Ch 206 THE CONCURRENT JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS  Congress

without limitation as to the nature of the controversy1 the federal courts sitting within a state construe the constitution and statutes and interpret the common law of that state To guarantee the supremacy of the sovereign state the Judicature Act provides that the laws of the several states shall be regarded as rules of decision in the federal courts2 But as this Act has been held not to include the laws of a state in the sense that precedents established by judicial decisions are laws3 the federal courts are not bound to follow the decisions of the state courts Indeed if they were so bound the purpose of this jurisdiction namely to prevent a possible bias in the state courts against a citizen of another state would be destroyed Nevertheless the inconvenience of having two interpretations of the law in the same territory early led the federal courts to follow the decisions of the local courts4 And this practice might have become universal had not a later federal decision made an exception on grounds of expediency in regard to questions of commercial law5 As a result two opposed and well defined principles have been recognized by the federal courts as controlling their treatment of the decisions of state courts Thus decisions by a state court which interpret the state constitution and statutes6 or constitute any rule of property7 or cover any matter of local regulation8 are accepted as binding In such matters the federal courts will reverse their own decisions after a ruling by the local court 9 the Supreme Court will follow a state decision made after the case has been decided in the circuit court 10 and any undecided question will if possible be left to the state court On the other hand state precedent is not controlling in matters of commercial 12 or general law13 So in a recent case when a state court had interpreted a will differently from the circuit court the decision of the state court was not followed when the case came again before the federal court on a second writ of error Messinger v Anderson I7I Fed 785 C C A Sixth Circ A further exception to the general policy of agreement with the state courts is well established when a contract is made by a foreign citizen under a state statute which has been held constitutional by a decision subsequently overruled the federal courts will follow the earlier view of the state court14 But this seems nothing more than an effective use of the discretion placed in the federal courts to prevent any injustice to foreign citizens5 As a result however of the exercise of discretionary jurisdiction by the i8 U S Stat L 47Q 2 i U S Stat L 92 3 See 22 HARV L REV 6iI 4 Brown v Van Braam 3 Dall 344 5 Swift v Tyson I6 Pet I 6 Fairfield v County of Gallatin Ioo U

140United States courts the idea has been advanced that there is a federal common law6 But any such law would be exercised over the territory of the states and in a given territory there can be but one law in existence at one time That law even though subject to alteration by two distinct sov ereigns as in this country where a federal statute changes the law of every state must nevertheless be the law of the territory or state And it is consequently the state law which the federal courts are interpreting7 That federal decisions are followed in disregard of state court decisions does not argue the existence of a federal common law but is simply an illustration of the essential feature of the common as distinct from the civil law  the authority of precedent MUTUAL EXCLUSIVENESS OF THE BUYERS REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY IN SALES OF PERSONALTY  It is almost universally recog nized that for the sellers breach of warranty the buyer has two remedies an action or counterclaim for damages on the contract and recoupment in a suit for the purchase price2 Rescission is also allowed by a number of States3 although denied by about an equal number 4 and by the English courts5 An interesting question is the consistency of these remedies In a recent case in a jurisdiction where rescission is allowed it was held that even under a code system of pleading a buyer cannot recover consequential damages when the case has been tried on the basis of rescission Houser e Haines Mfg Co v McKay IOI Pac 894 Wash This decision goes on the ground that the remedies by rescission and by suit on the contract are inconsistent and that therefore the doctrine of election allows the pur suit of one only6 The doctrine of election of remedies is based not on strict estoppel but on a distinct principle of public policy which requires that a defendant shall not be subjected to two inconsistent actions when the plaintiff is amply protected by one7 It does not apply however where a prior suit has been brought in ignorance of material facts8 or has been defeated either because brought before accrual of the right of action9 or because incompatible with the facts of the case0 But two actions properly brought of which one relies upon the existence of a contract and the other upon its disaffirmance 16 A federal common law was also supposedly established by certain regulations of interstate commerce See 15 HARV L REV 224 17 For a concurring view of this problem arising under the Australian Constitution see Clarke Australian Constitutional Law p I94 1 Mondel v Steel 8 M  W 858

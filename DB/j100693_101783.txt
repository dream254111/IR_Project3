Diamonds are the Island Borneo and the Continent of India extra  in tra Gangem Pegu is likewise reported to have several but the King not potent his Country being but thinly inhabited contents himself with his Mines of Rubies Saphires Topasses E meralds Gold Silver Brass Tinn and Lead and several other Commodities his Country affords in great plenty rather than to suffer new enquiries to be made lest the discovery of such an additional Treasure should invite some of his Neighbours more potent to invade himBut leaving the description of other places to those that know them better I shall only keep my self to the Coast of Coromandel with which I am acquainted and ha ving visited several of its Mines am able to say something thereof Experimentally The DiamondMines in these parts are generally adjacent to Rockyhills or Mountains whereof begins a great Ledge or Range near Cape Comorin extending in breadth about 50 English miles some conjoyning others scatterd and running thence in length quite through Bengula Inamong and near these Hills in several places are known to be as its believed most of them have Mines many of them are possessed by petty Princes or Rajaes of the Hundues some driven thither for shelter by the Mores who have taken the greatest part of their Country from them others never overcomeas the Rajaes on the Hills in and near Bengala who admit of little or no Commerce with their Neighbours or passage through their Country which being barren in few places affording good waterthe ways craggy and very toylsom especially to an Army the Moors covet not but let them enjoy it peacably yet to prevent danger they forbid digging as the King of Pegu does or dig some few Mines only very privately so that a great part of the Mines are unsearche and concealed But the Kingdoms of Golconda and Visiapore contain902 contain in them scope enough of ground known to have Mines sufficient to furnish all the World plentifully with Diamonds but their Kings permit digging only in some places appointed lest as it is imagined they should become too common and withal for fear of tempting the threatning greatness of Aureng zebe forbidding also those places that afford the largest Stones or else keeping workmen in them for their own private uses So that but a very small quantity in comparison of what might be and those only of ordinary size are found In the Kingdom of Golconda as near as I can gather from the best acquainted are 23 Mines now employed or that have been so lately viz Quolure Codawillicul Malabar Buttephalem Ramiah Gurem Muttampellee Currure Ganjeeconeta Lutta waar Jonagerree Pirai Dugullee Purwillee Anuntapellee Girregeta Maarmood Wazzergerree Munnemurg Langumboot Whootoor Muddemurg and Melwillee or the New Mine Quolure was the first Mine made use of in thi Kingdom The Earth is something yellowish not unlike the colour of our Gra vel dried but whiter in some places where it abounds with smooth pebbles much like some of those that come out of our Gravelpits in England They use to find great quantities in the Vein if it may properly be so called the Diamonds not lying in continued Clusters as some imagine but stequently so very scat teringthat sometimes in the space of 14 of an Acre of ground dig ged between two or three fathoms deep there hath been nothing found especially in the Mines that afford great Stones lying near the superficies of the Earth and about three fathoms deep deeper they could not dig for water it being in a Vale near a River In other places the Earth is mixt with rugged Stones where they seldom mine deeperthough in higher groundbefore the colour of the Earth alters and the Vein ceases which they give a guess at by the small Stones they find in the Earth the principal guide they have in the discovery of the Mines The Diamonds found in these Mines are generally wellshaped many of them pointed and of a good lively white water but it also produces some yellow ones some brown and of other co lours They are of ordinary sizesfrom about fix in a Mangelin  of which they find but few to five or six Mangelins each some of 10 15 20 they find but rarely They have frequently  A Mangelinis four grains in weight saith Linschoten899 frequently a bright and transparent skin inclining to a greenish colourthough the heart of the Stone be purely white but the veins of these Mines are almost worn out The Mines of Codawillikul Malabar and Buttepallem consist of a reddish Earth inclining to an orangecolour with which it stains the clothes of the Labourers that work in it they dig about 4 fathom deep They afford Stones generally of an ex cellent water and crystalline skin smaller sizes than those of Quolure Ramiah Gurem and Muttampellee have a yellowish Earth like Quolure their Stones like those of the two former Mines but mixt with many of a blew water These five Mines being under the same Government with Melwillee where the Governour resides He to draw the Adventurers and Merchants near himthat he may be better informed of the action and ad vantages and know the better how to fleece them the general practice of Governours in these parts has very lately forbid their use and commanded all to repair to his Residence which they must obey or flie into another Government The next Mine in our way is Currure the most famous of them all and most ancient It has been under subjection of the King of Golconda but about 25 years taken with the Country of Kar naticum from the HendueRajaesabout that timeby the Nabob Meer Jumla In it have been found Diamonds of a seize weight which is about 9 ounces Troy or 8112 Pagos weight It is only employed by the King for his own private use The Diamonds that are found in it are very well spred large stones it yields few or none small they have generally a bright skin which in clines to a pale greenish colour but within are purely white The Soyl is reddish as many of the others About sixty or seventy years ago when it was under the Go vernment of the Hundues and several persons permitted to ad venture in digging a Portugeez Gentleman went thither from Goa and having spent in Mining a great sum of mony to the a mounts of 100000 Pagosas tis reportedand converted every thing he brought with him that would fetch any mony even to what wearing clothes he could spare while the Miners were at work for the last days expence he had prepared a cup of Poy son resolving if that night he found nothing to drink his last with the conclusion of his mony but in the Evening the Work men brought him a very fair spread Stone of 20 Pagos weight in910 in commemoration whereof he caused a great Stone to be erected in the place with an Inscription engraven on it in the Hundues or Tellinga Tongue to the following effect which remains to be seen to this day Your Wife and Children sell sell what you have Spare not your Clothes naymake your self a Slave But money get then to C U R R U R E make hast There search the Mines aprize youl find at last After which he immediately returned with his Stone to Goa Not far from Currure are the Mines of Lattawaar and Gan jeeconta which are in the same Soyl as Currureand afford Stones not unlike But Lattawaar hath many representing the great end of a Razorblade thin on one side and thick on the other very white and of an excellent water but the best of the Mine is worn out and Ganjeeconta employed only to the Kings private use Jonagerre Pirai Dugulle Purwillee and Anuntapellee consist also of Red earth are now employed and afford many large Stones part of them of a greenish water but the most absolute Mines are of Wazzergerre and Munnemurg the other rather re presenting Pits than Mines for there they sink through high Rocks till they go so far below their basis that they can go no further for water in some places 40 or 50 fathom deep The superficies of the Rocks consist of hard firm white stone into which they cut a Pit like a Well of about 4 or 5 in some places 6 foot deep before they come to a crust of a Mineral Stone like the Mineral of Iron when they fill the Hole with Wood and keep as hot a fire as they can there for 2 or 3 days till they think it sufficiently heated then they pourin water till they have quencht it which also slakes and mollifies both Stone and Mineral both being cold they dig again take out all the crumbled stuff and dig up what they can besides before they heat it anew the crust seldom is thicker than 3 or 4 foot which ceasing they come to a vein of Earth that usually runs under the Rock 2 or 3 furlongs sometimes much further This they dig all out and search and it their first attempt prove successful they go to work again digging after the same manner as deep as they can till they come to water for the drawing whereof wanting the help of Engins known in Europe they can go no deeperalthough the Vein lie lowerall lumps of the Mineral they break911 break in pieces and frequently find Diamonds enclosed in them To work on these Mines is very expensive but the advantage is commonly answerable yet in respect of the certain disburse that must be before any thing be found they are not so much frequented as others where they may try their fortunes with a smaller stock The Earth they dig out is red Many large Stones are found here the smallest about 6 in a mangelleen They are mixt waters but the greatest part good only of illfavoured shapesmany cragged pieces of stones some as if they had been parts of very great ones others with pieces broken off them yet I never heard of any that found two seeming fellows al though they do those that look as if they had been newly broken In Langumboot they dig as they do at Wazzergerrec and Mun nemurg the Rock is not altogether so solid but the Earth and Stones it produces much alike Wootoor should have been placed next to Currureit lying near it and affording Stones of a like magnitude shapes and waters tis employed only to the Kings use And singularin that its Dia monds are found in black Earth Muddemurg far exceeds all the rest for Diamonds of a de licate shape waterand bright transparent skinproudas it were in discovering their inward beautieswith which no other Mine can compare yet it has also store of Veiny ones but those like wise of so curious shape and waterthat its difficult to discover them from the goodespecially the small ones It produces Stones of divers magnitudes from 10 and 12 in a mangelleen to 6 to 7 magelleens eachand besidessome great ones TheEarth is redbut its seated in the Woodsand the water so badthat to allexcept the people bred thereit presently occasions Feavers  destroys abundanceinsomuch that most of the Adventurers have forsaken it notwithstanding which it hath been more profitable than any of the restthe Vein frequently lying near the superficies of the Earth seldom running deep and is better furnisht than any other yet discoverd The River Kishna of excellent waters is but 9 miles distant but the Miners or Merchants are either poor that they cannotor else over awed by the Governour pretend to be and dare not be at the charges of fetching their water from thence Divers are of the opinion that besides the Water the Town lying in a bottom environd with Hills and  ad joyning the Air may be infected and contribute to its unhealth Fulnes 6 D Mel912 Melwillee or the New Mine so calledbecause it was but lately found out or at least permitted to be made use of in the year 1670 it had then a year employed the Minersbut it was forbid den and lay unoccupied till 1673 when complaint being made at Quolcurthat the Vein was worn out the King again licensed its settlement The Earth they mine in is very red and many of the Stones found there have of it sticking to them as if it had clung there while they were of a soft glutinous substance and had not attained their hardness maintaining its colour on its skin seeming to be roughned with it that it cannot be fetcht out by grinding on a rough Stone with Sand which they make use of to clean them The Stones are generally wellshaped their size from 5 or 6 in a mangelleen to those of 14 or 15 eachand some bigger but greatest quantities of the middle sorts Most of them have a thick dull skin incline to a yellowish water not altogether so strong  lively as of the other Minesvery few of them of a crystal lin water  skin They are reported to be apt to flaw in splitting which occasions these people to esteem them something softer than the product of many of the other Minesseveral that flatter by their seeming whiteness when rough discover their deceitfulness ha ving past the Mill and too often a yellowish tinctureto the dis appointment and loss of them that have cut them but what they want in goodness is in part sopplied by the plenty they find which together with their propertiesmake them the cheaper This being what I have gathered both by experience of several of the places I have seenand the best Informations I could meet withof the Mines in this Kingdom I shall now proceed to those in Visiapore Visiapore is known ocontain Mines enclosing Stones as large and good as those of Golconda but the Kingfor reasons already givenmakes use but of the meanest wherebyas Golconda is fa mcus for the largeness of those it affords Visiapore is noted for the smallest whose Mines though they seldom or never render an Adventurer a fortune or estate at once as sometimes those of Golconda doby a great a Stone or several found togethervet they are more populous and better employed the small Stones lying thicker in the earth so that the generality  gainers and few but they get their expence whereas those of Golconda dig a way a considerable Estate and find nothing others not their charges and where one is a gainer divers lose There913 There are 15 Mines employed in the Kingdom of Visiapore viz Ramulconeta Banugunnapellee Pendekull Moodawarum Cum merwillee PaulkullWorkull LungecpoleurPootloorPunchclingull ShingarrampentTondarpaarGundepelleeDonee and Gazerpellee In Kamulconeta Mines in red Earthabout 15 or 16 foot deep they seldom find a Diamond of a mangelleen weight but small to 20 or 30 in a mangelleen They are generally of an excellent crystalline water have a bright clear skin inclining frequently to a pale greenish colour are well shaped but few of them pointed ones There are also found amongst them several broken pieces of Diamonds by the Country people called Shemboes In BanugunnapelleePendekulland Moodawarum they dig as at Ramulconeta and in the same kind of Earth they also afford Stones much alikebeing neighbouring places Cummerwillee Paulkulland Workull are not far distant pro duce Stones much alike out of the same coloured Earth but very small ones even to a 100 in a mangelleen Lungepoleur Mines are of a yellowish Earth like those of Quoleur its Diamonds are generally well shapedglobularfew pointed of a very good crystalline water and bright skins ma ny of them have a thick dark grassgreen skinsome spotted also with black that they seem all foul yet are not so but within purely white and clean Their sizes are from 2 or 3 mangelleens downwardsbut few very small Poctloor Mines are of reddish Earth but afford Stones much like those of Lungepoleur only smaller under a mangelleen the general sizes are of 12 13 14 16 of a mangelleen PunchelingullShingarrampentand Tondarpaar are also of red Earth their Diamonds not unlike those of Quolcur only rarely or never any large ones are found there Gundepellee hath the same Earth with the former and pro duces Stones of equal magnitude but frequently of a pure cry stalline water wherein they exceed the former Donee and Gazerpellee dig both in red Earth likewise and afford Stones alikethe greatest part whereof are of good shapes and waters They have also many Shemboes and some of bad waters some brown which these people call soft or weak wa terd being esteemed of a soster and weaker body than others by reason they have not so much life when cut and are subject to flaw in splitting and on the Mill their general product is in 6 D 2 Stones914 Stones of middle sizes But Gazerpellee has besides many large ones and is the only Mine noted for such in the Kingdom of Visi apore With which concluding the description of the Mines I shall give some account how the Diamonds are found and how they handle the the Earth to find them which is as followeth The Diamonds are so scattered and dispersed in the Earthand lie so thin that in the most plentiful Mines its rare to find one in digging or till they have prepared the stuff and do search pur posely for them They are also frequently enclosd in Clodsand some of those of Melmillee the New Mine in the Kingdom of Golconda have the Earth so fixt about them that till they grind them on a rough Stone with sand they cannot move it suffici ently to discover they are transparent or were it not for their shapes to know them from other Stones At the first opening of the Mine the unskilful Labourers sometimes to try what they have found lay them on a great Stone and striking on them with another to their costly experience discover they had broken a Diamond One I knew who had an excellent Stone of 8 magel leens served so by ignorant Miners he employed Near the place where they dig they raise a Wall with such rugged Stones as they find at hand whereof all the Mines afford plenty of about 2 foot high and six foot over flooring it well with the same for the laying of which they have no other Mor tar than the Earth tempered with Water To strengthen and make it tight they throw up a bank against the side of it In one where of they leave a small vent about two inches from the bottom by which it empties it self into a little pit made in the earth to receive small Stones if by chance any should run through The vent being stopped they fill the Cistern they have made with water soaking therein as much of the Earth they dig out of the Mines as it can conveniently receive at a time breaking the clods picking out the great stones and stirring it with shovels till the water is all muddy the gravelly stuff falling to the bot tom then they open the vent letting out the foul water and supplying it with clean till all the Earthy substance be wasted away and none but a gravelly remains at the bottom Thus they continue washing till about 10 of the Clock before Noon when they take the gravelly stuff they have washed and spread it on a place made plain and smooth like a Bowlingalley for the purpose near the Cistern which being soon dried by the heat915 heat of the Sun at that time of the day they very curiously look it over that the smallest bit of a stone can hardly escape them They never examine the stuff they have washt but between the hours of ten and three least any cloud by interposing intercept the brisk beams of the Sun which they hold very necessary to assist them in their search the Diamonds not forbearing to re flect them when they touch therein rendring themselves thereby the more conspicuous Some of the expertest Labourers are employed in searching he that sets them at work usually sitting byand overlookingbut its hardly possible especially where many are employed to watch them so narrowly but that they may steal part of what they find as many times some of them doandselling it private ly convert to their own use If they find a large Stone they carry it not presently to their Employer but keep on looking having an eye on him till they observe he takes notice of itwhen with a turn of their hand they give him a glimpse of it but de liver it not till they have done work and then very privately it being the general endeavour to conceal what they find least it should come to the knowledge of the Governour of the place and he require a share which in the Kingdom of Golconda is u sually practiced without respect to any agreement made with them The Miners those that employ them and the Merchants that buy the Stones of them are generally Ethnicks not a Mussle man that ever I heard of followed the employment These La bourers and their Employers are Tellingas commonly Natives of or near the place The Merchants are the Banians of Guzzarat who for some Generations have forsaken their own Country to take up the Trade in which they have had such success that tis now solely engrossd by them who corresponding with their Countrymen in Surrat Goa Golconda Visiapore Agra and Dil lee and other places in India furnish them all with Diamonds The Governours of the Mines are also Idolaters In the King of Golcondas Dominions a Telling a Brammee rents most of them whose agreement with the Adventurer is that all the Stones they find under a  Pagoda weight are to be their own all of that weight and above it to be his for the Kings use But although this Agreement be signed and sealed unto he minds not at all the performance thereof but endeavours  A Pagoda weight is 9 Mangelleens916 endeavours to engross all the profit to himself by tyrannical squeezing both Merchants  Miners whom he not only taxes ve ry high but maintaining Spies among them of their own people on the least inkling that they have been any ways fortunate he immediately makes a demand on them and raises their Tax else on a false pretence they have found a great Stone drubs them till they surrender what they have to redeem their bodies from tor ment Besides the Excise is so high on all sorts of Provisions Beetle and Tobacco which to them is as absolutely necessary as Meat or at least in their esteem that it is thereby raised to dou ble that price they bear without the Government and it is fur nisht only by some Licensd persons if any other should en deavour to bring in the least quantity by stealthhe is fined even for one leaf of Tobacco if it be a person of any repute or worth any thing else severely drubd for it by which course there is hardly a man worth 500 l to be found amongst them most of them dealing by Moneys taken up at Interest of Usurers who reside there purposely to furnish them who with the Gover nour eat up their gains so that one would wonder any of them should stay and not betake themselves to places where they might have better usage as there are several in other Govern ments and some few that have the sense to remove but many their Debtsothers hopes of a great hit detains Both Mer chant and Minor go generally naked only a poor Clout about their middle and a Shash on their heads they dare not wear a Coat left the Governour should say they have thriven much are rich and so inlarge his Demands on them The wisest when they find a great Stoneconceal it till they have an opportunity and then with Wife and Children run all away into the Visiapore Country where they are secure The Government in the Visiapore Country is better their A greement observd Taxes easier and no such Impositions on pro visions the Merchants go handsomly clad amongst whom are several persons of considerable Estates which they are permit ted to enjoy peaceablyby reason whereof their Mines are much more popuious and better employed than those of Golconda It is observablethat notwithstanding the Agreement with the Adventurers of the Mines that all Stones above a certain weight shall be for the Kings use yet in the Metropolis of either King dom as the Cities of Golconda and Visiapore are there is no sei zure917 zure all Stones are free and the late deceased King Abdull Cutopshaw of the former and Edelshaw of the latter would not only give very great prizes for large Stones but richly vest and present the Merchant that sold them with Horses or something else of value thereby encouraging others to bring the like But the present King of Visiapore is a Child and the King of Golcon das delights solely pleased on light Womendancersand Trick shewers that he neither minds Diamonds nor many things more necessary committing the Government of his Kingdom to a Tel linga Braminee which the Mussleman not well resenting does in some measure threaten the stability of his State

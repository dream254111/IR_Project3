j100588,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London,108279,On the Compounds of Tin and Iodine,i207000, 363  XVII On the Compounds of Tin and Iodine By THOMAS H HENRY Esq Communicated by R PHILLIPS Esq FRS Received March 31Read June 19 1845 IN a paper by Sir H DAVY published in the Philosophical Transactions 1814 he describes the compound of tin and iodine procured by heating these bodies together out of the contact of air as of a deep orange colour fusible at a moderate heat and volatile at a higher temperature The compound obtained by GAYLUSSAC by gently heating tin with twice its weight of iodine and more recently by RAMMELSBERG by the same methodx is described by them as a reddishbrown transparent substance yielding a powder of a dirty orangeyellow colour and easily fusible A compound of tin and iodine was procured by BOULLAY by precipitating a solution of protochloride of tin with iodide of potassium in slight excess The combinations procured by these methods have been considered to be identical in compogition although the compound procured both by GAYLussAc and by RAM MELSBERG is stated by them to be decomposed by water while the salt of BOULLAY is described by him as soluble in water without decomposition It will be seen I think fiom the following experiments that the substance procured by heating tin with twice its weight of iodine is a mixture of two salts differing in composition one of which is soluble in water to a slight extent without suffering decomposition while the other is immediately decomposed on bringing it in contact with water the former being the real protiodide described by BOULLAY and the latter a biniodide a salt which has not yet to my knowledge at least been described but which must have been the compound mentioned by Sir H DAVY as it is of a brilliant orange colour and sublimnes at a temperature of 356 FAHR while the protiodide I find may be heated to redness out of the contact of air without subliming l00 grs of tin in a state of minute division were mixed with 220 grs of iodine the mixture placed in a porcelain crucible wellcovered and sufficient heat being applied to fuse the iodine violent action immediately took place accompanied by the evolution of miuch heat and the sublimation of a portion of the iodine when the action had ceased and the crucible had become cool a brown transparent crystalline mass weighing 310 grs was removed from it 10 grs of iodine had been sublimed therefore by the heat evolved during the combination upon breaking this mass however a button of metallic tin weighing 45 grs was found inclosed in it This  Gmelin Handbuch vol iii t Annales de Chimie xxxiv 372MR HENRY ON THE COMPOUNDS OF TIN AND IODINE substance could not be the neutral compound for the 210 grs of iodine would require 98 grs of tin to formn the protiodide instead of only 55 grs The mass was thlerefore heated again in a Florence flask wellcorked with 45 grs of tin in very fine powder to replace the button removed fromt it in order to ascertain whether the neutral compound could be procured by digesting this substance with the metal in a state more favourable to combination The mass readily fused without any further action on the tin but an orangered sublimate was formed condensing on the sides of the flask in brilliant acicular crystals As the mass in the flask dimi nished in quantity it became less fusible until at length it required a degree of heat little short of dull redness to produce that effect and then it ceased to give off vapour The flask was now allowed to cool when cold it was cut and the fused residue removed which was found to weigh 865 grs after the separation of 375 grs of tin still uncombined This substance was of a deep rled colour and crystalline texture affording a powder of a bright red colour similar to that of minium  50 parts of it were treated with strong nitric acid which acted violently upon it expelling iodine and leaving peroxide of tin which weighed after ignition 221 parts  1738 metallic tin 3476 per cent a compound of one equivalent of tin  59 and one of iodine  126 would give 3189 per cent This excess in the quantity of tin arose from the heat employed in sepa rating the two compounds producing a portion of oxide by the decomposition of the protosalt as will be seen further on To ascertain the composition of the sublimate 50 parts of it were decomposed by nitric acid and gave 122 parts of peroxide  9597 metal  1919 per cent 100 parts treated with a solution of pure carbonate of potash in slight excess were decomposed carbonic acid being evolved anld peroxide of tin precipitated the iodide of potassiunl produced was separated by alcohol and after dilution with water was treated with nitrate of silver the precipitate dried and fused weighed 1485 7999 iodine This gives Theory Experiment 2 Iodine 252 81 7999 1 Tin   59 19 1919 311 100 9918 It was therefore a biniodide In the next experiment I took one atom of each substance viz 59 grs of tin and 126 grs of iodine The action was violent as before there were 16 grs of tin un combined and after the sublimation of the biniodide the fused protosalt weighed 66 grs this was exposed to the air as little as possible during the process of subli mation which being performed in a retort less oxide was formed in consequence 50 parts gave 211 peroxide of tin  332 per cent metal In order to ascertain the action of heat upon the protiodide of tin I prepared some by precipitating a warm concentrated solution of recently prepared protochloride of tin by a strong solution of iodide of potassium in slight excess  the salt formed on cooling in beau 364MR HENRY ON THE COMPOUNDS OF TIN AND IODINE tiful acicular crystals which after being washed with a little water lost their lustre by drying at a very gentle heat 50 parts gave 207 parts peroxide 3236 per cent tin  10 grs of this were heated in a small tube tightly corked at first gently and afterwards to complete fusion a little water condensed on the upper part of the tube with a minute portion of binio dide When cold the tube was cut the fused mass removed and found to have lost 15 gr it was slightly oxidized on the surface and perfectly resembled the protiodide procured in the former experiments 253 grs of the same salt were heated to from 380 to 400 in an open porcelain crucible a sublimate was produced which was received in a paper cone so placed on the crucible as not to prevent the access of air when no more vapour was given off the crucible was cooled and weighed the residue was found to weigh 604 grs it was ignited and then weighed 591 grs and was peroxide of tin The sublimate which was in small brilliant orangered crystals was biniodide of tin for 460 grs decomposed with nitric acid and ignited gave 1 115 peroxide  1906 per cent of metal Now supposing that two atoms of protiodide of tin had been decomposed giving rise to one atom of periodide and one atom of peroxide of tin 253 grs of protiodide should have left 513 grs of peroxide which is sufficiently near the quantity obtained to determine the nature of the decomposition BERZELIUS states that the proto fluoride of tin is converted by the action of the atmosphere into SnF2 SnO2 a decomposition exactly analogous to that above described I have not succeeded in obtaining a combination of tin and iodine corresponding to the sesquioxide although BOULLAY conjectured that some yellow crystals which he obtained on adding to a solution of protochloride of tin a solution of iodide of potassium in which an additional halfatom was dissolved were sesquiiodide the crystals I obtained by this method were found to be pure protiodide On adding iodine to a solution of protochloride of tin this salt suffers a remarkable decomposition if its solution be concentrated an iodide of tin is precipitated and a combination of chloride and iodide of the metal in definite proportions remains dis solved in the solution If the iodine be added in excess so that the solution acquires a brown colollr it yields crystals of biniodide on evaporation if on the other hand the protochloride be in excess a portion of the protiodide is precipitated and the re nmainder unites with protochloride of tin in the proportion of one equivalent of each substance and it renmains dissolved in the solution of protochloride but may be sepa rated by evaporation in the form of delicate acicular crystals of a silky lustre and strawyellow colour On adding iodine to an equal weight of protochloride of tin dissolved in a small quantity of water I obtained some minute red crystals which yielded on analysis Per cent Iodine   7930 Tin    1998 9928 365MR HENRY ON THE COMPOUNDS OF TIN AND IODINE it was the biniodide therefore with 380 grs of the protochloride of tin and 150 grs of iodine a precipitate was obtained which was found to yield Per cent Iodine   67878 Tlin   3167 9945 it was therefore protiodide of tin The solution remaining after the precipitation of the protiodide was evaporated at a gentle heat until sufficiently concentrated and allowed to cool some crystals were thus obtained which were freed as much as possible from the motherliquor by pressure in bibulous paper but on attempting to purify them for analysis by redis solving thenl in water they were immediately decomposed giving a scarlet crystal line precipitate of protiodide of tin while chloride of tin remained in solution they were therefore pressed as dry as possible in bibulous paper and afterwards retained in vacuo over sulphuric acid for some hours 10 grs were then treated with a solution of pure carbonate of potash evaporated to dryness redissolved in cold water and separated from the protoxide of tin by fil tration the solution acidulated with nitric acid and the iodine precipitated by nitrate of palladium while hot the precipitate washed dried and ignited left 194gr of metallic palladium 4586 grs iodine The chlorine was afterwards precipitated by nitrate of silver the plecipitate washed dried and fused weighed 522 grs upon dissolving the chloride of silver in ammonia 0 1 gr of metallic palladium was sepa rated which had subsided with the chloride of silver as a subsalt this leaves 512 for the true weight of the chloride of silver 1 263 chlorine 5 grs decomposed with nitric acid in excess evaporated to dryness and ignited gave 268 grs peroxide of tin 2108 of metallic tin This gives in 100 parts Theory Per cent Experiment One atomt chlorine  354 or 1267 1263 One atom iodine 126 or 4510 4586 Two atoms tin  118 or 4223 4216 2794 10000 10065 It is therefore a compound of one atom of protochloride of tin and one atom of prot iodide of tin The excess in the quantity of iodine in the above analysis is pr obably owing to the tendency of the protonitrate of palladium to subside as a basic salt in company with precipitates which is a great objection to its employment in analysis As the protochloride of tin is stated by GMELIN on the authority of BERZELIUS to contain one atom of water of crystallization while the late Dr TURNER in the last edition of his Elements published during his lifet states that it contains three atoms  Handbuch vol iii t Edit v p 550 366MR HENRY ON THE COMPOUNDS OF TIN AND IODINE of water of crystallization and several works of character do not give the composi tion of the crystallized salt at all it became necessary to analyse the salt used in the above experiments it was obtained by digesting strong hydrochloric acid with tin in excess at a moderate heat and when a tolerably concentrated solution was ob tained decanting it and setting it aside to crystallize the strongly acid motherliquor was again digested with the tin and took up a fresh portion it appears impossible to saturate hydrochloric acid with tin at once The salt was in small prismatic crystals and dissolved in water after drying on blottingpaper forming a perfectly clear solu tion and producing a great degree of cold 700 grs dissolved in 3 oz of water re duced the temperature from 58 to 27 FAHR The crystals were coarsely powdered and pressed as dry as possible in bibulous paper 25 grs weire dissolved in water acidulated by sulphuric acid and the tin pre cipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen the protosulphuret washed and dried weighed 1723 grs 162 of these were ignited in a porcelain crucible and the ignition repeated with a little carbonate of ammonia gave 156 grs of peroxide this corresponds to 1659 on the total quantity of sulphuret which is equivalent to 1309 of metal The excess of sulphuretted hydrogen was removed by a little sulphate of copper and the chlorine precipitated by nitrate of silver gave 3094 grs of fused chloride of silver 772 chlorine To determine the water 2358 grains were retained in vacuo over sulphuric acid for twentyfour hours and were found to have lost 387 grains  1641 per cent  we have therefore Experiment Theory Atom

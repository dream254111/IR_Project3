results can be reached whether we call the transaction a condi tional sale or a mortgage Since the retention of title by a conditional vendor is merely to have security for the purchase price the trans action is in its essence a mortgage21 This is evidenced by the fact that the risk of loss of the goods is not on the seller despite his legal title but is on the buyer22 It follows that since a mortgagee is permitted to foreclose and sell the property and then recover any deficiency from the mortgagor a conditional vendor should have a similar right23 The court in the Charavay Case seems to fear that if a conditional vendor retakes the goods he thereby destroys the consideration for the debtors obligation to pay and consequently cannot thereafter maintain an action for the deficiency But this difficulty is avoided if the vendor reclaim the property not as his own but expressly for the purpose of reselling on account of the buyer24 And finally it is only a logical extension of this analogy to permit the conditional vendors title to stand as security not only for the purchase price of those particular goods but also for other debts as well if the parties so stipulate In such a case the bank might be the legal owner of the goods until they were paid for and might thereafter have an equitable lien on them for other debts2 EQUITABLE CONVERSION AS BETWEEN LIFE TENANT AND REMAINDER MANWhere a life estate is followed by one or more remainders the testator is presumed to have intended to afford the remainderman a substantial enjoyment of the property and in the endeavor of the courts to carry out this intention without prejudicing the life tenant perplexing problems often arise In order to effectuate this supposed intention it has been found necessary in many cases to invoke the doctrine of equitable conversion Since the facts indicating the testators intention vary with each case the theory is however often difficult of general application There is obviously no objection to invoking the doctrine where there has been a specific testamentary direction Tmandatory in its nature to convert realty into personalty or vice versal without leaving any discretion in the executor or trustee2 Where the trustee is given discretion as to the time or Williston Sales  330 Tiffany Sales I42I43 Prof Williston 20 Harvard Law Rev 370371 and note Perhaps this may explain

been held that conversion should be had even in the absence of any direction for such metamorphosis if the general testamentary scheme be otherwise unworkable4 It is generally said that the fact that the testator has blended real and personal property in a specific or residuary gift is strong evidence to support an equitable conversion5 In the foregoing cases a conversion as to remaindermen dates from the death of the testator although there may have been a direction that the life tenant should enjoy the property in specie6 If however the vesting of a discretion in the trustee be not accompanied by a positive direction to convert7 and the general testamentary scheme be con sistent with leaving the estate in statu quo or where there is a direc tion for conversion at some specific time in the future8 then the real property will not become personalty immediately at the death of the testator in the contemplation of equity This proposition was urged in the recent case of Lawrence v Littlefield N Y App Div 1915 52 N Y L J March 22 1915 not yet reported in which a share of residuary real and personal property was given in trust to invest and pay the proceeds over to a designated beneficiary with remainders over to her children The trustees were given authority to sell the real estate upon such terms as in their judgment should be deemed proper to pay off liens out of the proceeds and invest the surplus for the plaintiffs benefit in the manner directed Although the real estate in question was unproductive and continually depreciating in value no sale thereof had been made by the trustees other than was necessary to pay off liens which had accrued against the property so that the plaintiff had received no income from the real estate for over four years In a suit brought by her to recover the back income out of other sums of money which had been received by the adminis trator c t a it was held that she was not entitled to recover In a prior proceeding to construe the will it had been decided that the provision for blending in the residuary clause had worked a conversion of the real estate into personalty from the time of the testators death The court in the principal case adopted this view with some reluctance but decided nevertheless that the life tenant was not entitled to If there be a direction to convert a specific sum into personalty and a surplus remain such surplus will be treated as real property See James v Hanks 19o3 202 Ill II4 There will be no conversion should the devise in which conversion is directed be ineffectual as contrary

the trustees This position does not appear inconsistent on its face since the mere change in the name of real property to personalty would not ipso facto entitle the life tenant to income where the land converted was not actually turned into money and the land as such remained unproduc tive9 It remains however to test the decision in light of the rule laid down in Howe v Earl of Dartmouth10 a case which has been consistently followed in the United Statesl It was there held that where a general or residuary bequest of personal property for life with remainders over consisted of wasting or perishable property such property should be promptly converted into money and invested in Consolidated Annuities12 to pay the yearly income over to the life tenant in order to save the bequest of the remainderman in accord ance with the testators intentionl3 In order to further effectuate this intention the courts have logically extended the doctrine to cases in which the property was simply unproductivel It should follow that there is a reciprocal duty to permit the life tenant a reasonable income and it is accordingly held that a gift of unproductive property yielding nothing during the life tenancy such as a reversionary interest should be converted into money and invested for his benefitG If however the testator indicate that conversion shall be delayed or shall never accrue the rule in Howe v Earl of Dartmouth is held inapplicable Such intention is manifested by a direction to convert at some period of time in the future6l or by the vesting of a discretion in the executor or trustee in regard to the time of conversionl7 It would seem that the principal case can be supported only as falling within this class and that an actual conversion into productive per sonalty could be postponed in the discretion of the trustees even though the land was personal property in the contemplation of equity Since See In re Searle L R g9oo 2 Ch 829 I802 7 Ves Jr I37 Covenhoven v Shuler

unknown to the early common law has been growing steadily since the time of its creation by statute1 But the English courts still regard interest as something to be had as a matter of law only by virtue of statute2 or a promise to pay it express or implied from usage of trade8 The rigidity of this rule has been relaxed in cases where a definite sum of money is due at a fixed time by allowing the jury in its discretion to give interest by way of damages4 and by statute this method of compensation has been extended to many actions such as trover trespass de bonis asportatis and actions on insurance policies8 But even in cases of commercial paper if interest be not payable by the terms of the note it can be recovered only as damages in the discretion of the court or jury6 These principles still obtain in several jurisdictions in this country where it is often broadly stated that the recovery of interest depends entirely upon statute7 The prevailing view however is that interest is the natural growth of money and should be given to the plaintiff with the principal to compensate him fully whenever he has sustained pecuniary damage8 Where the demand is liquidated or can be com puted easily from recognized standards there is little difficulty in For examples of the somewhat contradictory phrase abuse of dis cretion see Severns Estate No 2 I905 2I Pa 68 Wilkinson v Duncan supra Because of the inherent difficulty of selling unproductive real estate it will require a clear indication of neglect to impugn this discretion Hites Devisees v Hites Exr I892 93 Ky 257 It is generally held that where the rule in Howe v Earl of Dartmouth is not applicable the life tenant is entitled to the actual return from the property see Yates v Yates supra and if there be no such

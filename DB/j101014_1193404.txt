Department of Correction History N various forms the functions of a department of correction have been exercised since the earliest settlement of Manhattan Island Sutton in his history of The Tombs points out that jails penitentiaries bridewells and houses of correction existed in New York a century and a half before the state and were organized and reorganized in the most ancient charters The first building used for a jail in the city of New York was built in 1642 The first house of correction called a bridewell in 1734 and the penitentiary located first at Bellevue date as far back as 1816 The Tombs so called from its resemblance to an ancient Egyptian tomb was ready for occupancy in 1838 The necessity for separat ting juvenile offenders from hardened criminals was recognized and the House of Refuge was the outcome This was opened in 1825 and in 1851 was transferred to its present site on Randalls Island I have not been able to trace in detail the succession of officials who under various names have controlled the correctional institutions of the city but as far back as 1841 there was a com missioner of the almshouse who had charge of both charitable and correctional institutions Early in 1849 the New York state legislature passed an act establishing a board of governors to have charge of the correctional and charitable institutions of the city They were ten in number and were known as the governors of the almshouse In the same year the workhouse was established by an act of the legislature The report issued by the board of governors of the workhouse appeared in 1850 and covered the activities of the preceding year This board controlled such diverse institutions as the almshouse Bellevue Hospital hospitals on Blackwells Island the city prison children at nurse the colored home the colored orphan asylum the lunatic asylum the peniten tiary the penitentiary hospital Randalls Island and the work house They also had charge of the department of outdoor poor They appointed the heads of each institution but these heads 564CHARITIES AND CORRECTION appointed their own subordinates and were responsible for their good conduct At this time the penitentiary received those committed from the courts for the more serious offenses The workhouse was originally designed to meet the need of compelling to work those ablebodied persons who were seeking refuge as vagrants in the almshouse and the first inmates of the workhouse were received not directly from the courts but by transfer from the almshouse In reading the reports of the board of governors for the early years one might almost be reading from reports written at the present time In discussing both penitentiary and workhouse there is complaint of overcrowding of the institutions of lack of classification of the danger of putting together hardened criminals and first offenders of the greater difficulty in controlling and re forming women of the need of supplying a greater amount of labor and an interesting discussion of the desirability of payment of wages to those employed in productive labor As far back as 1850 the experiment was tried in the workhouse of paying for labor in accordance with a sliding scale ranging from thirtyseven and a half cents to sixty cents per day In 1851 the rate schedule was reduced fifteen cents per diem in order to discourage repeaters Apparently the experiment did not work out satisfactorily It is noted that men who have accumulated through industry a sum of money are apt to go out and squander it and then seek recom mitment in order to replenish their purses After a few years the experiment was apparently given up for in later reports no men tion is made of payment to prisoners I have not been able to find complete files of the annual reports but for the ten years preceding the Civil War there is frequent mention of the fight made by correctional officials against venereal disease particularly among women What amounts to a recom mendation for an indeterminate sentence in the case of those so afflicted is put forward but I cannot find that it was ever acted on The charge is made in this connection that women of the street commit themselves to get cured of a venereal disease and that when cured their companions in guilt apply for writs of habeas corpus In 1851 359 women were discharged in this way For several successive years the abuses of the writ of habeas 565 87 No 388 THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY VOL V corpus are cited in the reports In 1853 Dr Sanger was appointed physician to the hospital on Blackwells Island and it is interesting that his history of prostitution is so far as I know the first history on this subject in the English language Apparently contract labor in both workhouse and penitentiary was in vogue in the later fifties In 1861 the workhouse report mentions the fact that two contracts in the workhouse one for hoop skirts and the other for military caps bring in great revenuesthe total receipts for contracts for the year amounting to 854292 In 1860 the New York state legislature passed an act creating in the city and county of New York the department of charities and correction and abolishing the board of governors of the alms house Four commissioners were appointed for terms of five years The reports of the commissioners during the Civil War are brief The attention of the citizens was naturally directed to the great conflict and interest in matters of crime diminished The great falling off of the number of inmates in all the correct ional institutions is noted but reports state that the number of women committed increased During the latter years of the Civil War men who violated laws were frequently given the option of commitment to penal institutions or enlistment and many of them chose the latter I have the word of a distinguished citizen of New York who at the age of nineteen was an army officer to the effect that the men of this class who lived and served for at least a year became a most efficient fighting force In the reports of 1864 and 1865 quite severe criticism is made of the system of prison discipline The penitentiary is called a school of vice and penitentiary methods are termed unwise and inefficient treatment In 1866 an appeal to the public is made to deal with causes rather than with effects and attention is called to the defective education of the children of the city and the growth of the dependent and delinquent classes In 1870 the local government of New York city was reorganized and the number of commissioners of charities and correction was changed from four to five but in 1875 the number of commissioners had been reduced to three During the period between 1870 and 1896 at which latter date the department of correction was separated from the department 566CHARITIES AND CORRECTION of charities many improvements were made in the various institu tions district prisons were rebuilt and added to the shops were increased in number the overflow from workhouse and peniten tiary was taken care of on Harts Island and later on Rikers Island classification was carried out to the extent of establishing a reformatory school in 1902 for the workhouse boys under twenty one years of age salaries were increased and a greater number of women were employed to look after the women prisoners added cell accommodations were built at the penitentiary But with all these improvements there is still the complaint of overcrowding lack of industrial employment and ineffective results Back in the sixties grandjury investigations reported adversely on the crowded conditions particularly in the city prison On the completion of the new city prison at Center and Franklin streets in 1903 it was supposed that provision was made for some time to come for the group of prisoners quartered here but this belief was illfounded In a very few years the complaint of over crowding begins again With the adoption of the constitution of 1894 contract work which had given occupation and furnished a source of revenue to the city was abolished The state use system was introduced and the labor of prisoners in the city institutions had to be employed in the manufacture of articles which could be utilized in other institutions or in municipal departments or in construction work for the city I can find no printed reports for the department of correction for the period between 1893 and 1902 In 1902 the department of correction was under one commissioner In 1905 the state legislature passed an act providing for the sale of land of Kings County penitentiary and the removal of the inmates to a peniten tiary to be established at Rikers Island under the jurisdiction of the department of correction This plan was never carried out in its entirety An appropriation of 2000000 was made for a penitentiary that was to cost 4000000 when completed Plans for a great congregate building were prepared at a cost of 80000 They were never executed and the appropriation was afterward rescinded The penitentiary prisoners from Kings County were removed to the Blackwells Island penitentiary without a suitable increase in accommodations In 1905 the New York city reforma 567 No 3 8990 THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY VOL V tory was established by an act of the legislature and in 1910 two new buildings for the use of the reformatory inmates were com pleted Buildings belonging to the hospital for the insane once located there completed the plant Provision was made in this manner for 250 inmates More than twice that number are now housed in the reformatory with no increased accommodations In 1912 the Queens County jail came under the jurisdiction of the department of correction Private citizens and private organizations have taken an active but varying interest in the work of the department The American Female Guardian Society began work in the penal institutions of the city between 1840 and 1846 and were responsible for securing from the city officials the appointment of women to look after the women prisoners The prison association organized in 1844 began at this time its supervision of the conditions of the insti tutions The interest and work of the latter organization continue to the present time and for the city institutions other than the city reformatory it performs a service similar to that rendered by the state board of charities to the reformatory and to public and private correctional institutions of the state at large So far as I can gather from the material at my command it would appear that previous to the Civil War the authorities and the people of the city were wide awake and alive to the necessities of changing conditions if prisons were to be anything more than places of punishment The great Civil War withdrew the atten tion of the public from these problems and at its close the growth of the city the beginnings of the problems of immigration and above all the unfortunate part played by party politics in the management of city affairs seem to have halted the proper devel opment of our penal institutions The same topics are touched upon year after year the same complaints made Apparently however the city has never been able to catch up with its correc tional problem still less to solve it Present Organization Today the department of correction exercises supervision over all the penal institutions of the boroughs of Manhattan Kings and Queens The institutions are grouped into three classes 568CHARITIES AND CORRECTION 1 The district prisons of the borough of Manhattan in which prisoners are held subject to arraignment in the magistrates courts and from which they are transferred to the city prison popularly known as The Tombs The district prisons are known as the Harlem Prison the West Fiftythird Street Prison the East Fiftyseventh Street Prison Essex Market Prison and Jefferson Market Prison 2 The three city prisonsManhattan Kings and Queens These prisons are intended to house those prisoners awaiting trial by special sessions indictment by the grand juries or trial by county courts or general sessions Under existing conditions however it is necessary to transfer to these prisons men who are serving sentences 3 The third group comprises the institutions in which prisoners serve sentences These are the penitentiary the workhouse the branches of the two institutions at Rikers Island and at Harts Island the city reformatory located at Harts Island and the New Hampton farm a country branch at present of the city reforma tory The administration of the departmrent is in the hands of a commissioner with one deputy The administrative force numbers only eighteen persons the department of records and statistics seven persons the engineering staff twentyfour the storekeeping staff eighteen The total force of the department is six hundred and eight The appropriation for the maintenance of the depart ment for the year 1915 amounts to 131222051 The most interesting group of institutions is the group in which prisoners serve sentences These institutions are most important to the community as they are to serve either as deterrents to the commission of crime or better where possible for the reformation of the criminal At this time all these institutions are badly overcrowded On January 1 1914 when the present administra tion took charge of the city there were in the penal institutions of the city 4602 prisoners In the latter part of February 1915 we had in our care 7467 prisoners an increase of over fifty per cent During the same period there was practically no increase in the accommodation for the prisoners and an increase of less than four per cent in the number of persons to care for them The 569 91 No 392 THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY VOL V difficulties and dangers of such a situation are obvious In the workhouse at Blackwells Island we have had more than 1800 prisoners As many as 730 women have occupied quarters designed for 150 At the penitentiary the population has passed the 1800 mark and even after the removal of the women to Queens the penitentiary has not been able to accommodate in cells all the men sentenced there even with the relief afforded by transfers to the other institutions of the department This crowded condition has been due not alone to the increase in the actual number of commitments but to the increased length of sentence Under these conditions it has been only by the greatest devotion to duty on the part of wardens keepers matrons and other employes that a very serious condition of affairs has not resulted The employes of the department are entitled to the highest possible credit We are fully aware far more so than any outside critics can possibly be of the shortcomings of the department but in criticizing the public is asked to remember the difficult condi tions under which we have been obliged to do our work for the last yearthe inadequacy of the buildings the lack of proper equip ment to give employment the strain put upon the employes through the great additional work the difficulty of securing funds necessary even to feed and clothe properly Nevertheless the outlook is not hopeless We have we believe mastered the situation sufficiently to be able to outline a plan which if it can be followed through will greatly improve existing conditions It is an accepted principle of modem penology that society is best served by the reform of offenders and that where this is not possible society should be protected by the custodial care of its enemies To secure reform certain fundamentals are necessary proper housing conditions not in luxurious quarters but with plenty of air and sunshine proper sanitation opportunity for classification a chance to develop selfcontrol and initiative on the part of the prisoners and above all opportunity for educational training where it is needed industrial training and occupation and the awakening of the spiritual faculties These cannot of course be given fully under existing conditions In the first place most of the buildings of the department are old and 570CHARITIES AND CORRECTION should be condemned if for nothing else on account of their lack of sanitation In this connection I would say that the department of health has been requested to make and is making a complete survey of the one hundred and ninety buildings belonging to the department As soon as this survey has been completed a report will be made which will enable us to know exactly where we stand and will make it possible for us to lay before the public an authori tative statement as to the needs of our department in this direction The labor problem is probably the one which is most difficult to solve The question is continually asked as to why industries cannot be conducted on a paying basis just as private industries are conducted Why cannot penal institutions be made self supporting More than this why is it not possible to pay a fair wage if not a standard union wage to prisoners who can and do do the work of the industrial departments The reasons are not far to seek First a market In accordance with the constitution of New York state this can be found only in city institutions and city departments We can place absolutely nothing on the open market Other city institutions and other city departments do not want our wares unless they equal in quality goods at the same price which can be bought in the open market The proposition works both ways It has not been possible in the past for the city to afford modem machinery Without modem machinery it has been impossible to produce articles of the first quality It has seemed to be a vicious circle A private manufacturer who instals expensive machinery must use it up to capacity to make it pay He cannot afford to have it lie idle In modem industry machine work is large in proportion to hand labor It must be to be profitable In prisons hand labor has always borne a large propor tion to machine work At the present moment our neighboring state of Pennsylvania is attempting to replace a law which absol utely forbids the use of power machines and which permits only thirtyfive per cent of the prisoners to be used in productive labor by a law in vogue in New York state whereby the labor of all prisoners may be employed under the state use plan Second on the side of labor there are no special reasons short of passing the time why prisoners should work and work well 571 93 No 394 THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY VOL V So far as New York city institutions are concerned no premium is placed upon faithfulness or skill in the shops The man who idles dislikes his work wastes materials is on the same level as the man who does efficient work Human nature is much the same in prison as out of it Perhaps most of us would not do much if there were not some incentive as a reward for application One of the reasons why moder penologists are advocating farm colonies for penal institutions is the greater opportunities for the employment of labor in ways that will be productive To help us solve the problem of prison labor on the side of the labor itself a bill has been introduced at Albany which we hope will become a law This bill provides for the introduction of an indeterminate sentence and parole system for the workhouse and penitentiary If it becomes a law the bill will enable us to reward faithful service if not with money at least with what is as valuable to the prisoner as money and that is time off With this lever we believe we can secure effective work in the shops The passage of the bill will be the first great important step in our plan for the reorganization of our department Plan for Reorganization In planning reorganization the vital points are the necessary changes in the organization and administration of the three institu tions with their branches in which sentences are served The penitentiary and workhouse proper are located on Blackwells Island On this island are three of the great charitable institutions of the citythe city hospital the city home and the metropolitan hospital Our two institutions each lie between two of the chari table institutions Jurisdiction over the island is divided between the department of charities and the department of correction We have practically no grounds surrounding either institution We can give little outdoor work or outdoor exercise to the prisoners practically none to the seven or eight hundred women at the work house We desire to remove both these institutions from Black wells Island giving over the entire island to our sister department which would welcome our departure 1 At this date April 30 the bill has passed has been signed by the mayors of the three firstclass cities and is now waiting the governors signature 572CHARITIES AND CORRECTION We have already begun to prepare for the removal of the work house At Rikers Island we have four hundred acres of ground most of it made by the deposits from the street cleaning department The soil is fertile and we are told is admirably adapted to intensive truck gardening With inmate labor we are building simple wooden dormitories on solid concrete foundations which later on can be used for a more permanent type of buildings These dormitories will accommodate about one hundred fifty men each They have been built entirely by prison labor costing about half what they would have cost had they been built by contract One such building is already completed and another will be com pleted within a week or ten days Before next winter we expect to be able to accommodate on the island one thousand workhouse men In addition to the wooden dormitories we are building a cell house to accommodate the men who do not prove good citizens in a community life It is our intention to employ prisoners during the first years of occupation in preparing the land for farming operations The refuse contains broken bottles tin cans and other matter foreign to farming operations This is to be removed by means of sifting This work will employ a large number of men and when the ground is prepared several hundred can be profitably employed for a good part of the year Industrial occupation will have to be provided for the remainder of the men and for all during the winter months Such plans are already under way but are not yet in shape to be made public Ultimately we hope to provide quarters on Rikers Island for all the men prisoners of the workhouse at a cost of only a small part of the 4000000 which a few years ago it was planned to spend for the penitentiary and for which 80000 was actually spent in architects plans afterward abandoned For the sentenced women of the department of correction we hope to secure a farm colony outside of the city limits Here we will build a cottage type of institution thus making classification possible The purchase of this land is the only land which we shall have to ask the city to buy in order to carry out our plan In this colony we will place the women sentenced both to the workhouse and to the penitentiary In character there is little to choose between them The passage of the HoffMills bill will make it 573 No 31 9596 THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW YORK CITY VOL V possible for us to hold the repeaters for a maximum of two years if desirable and to send them out under the supervision of parole officers The plans for the development of the New York city reformatory for male misdemeanants at New Hampton are well under way A colony of about fifty young men has been there for the past year and these young men have done much toward getting the land under cultivation Last summer the value of the crops more than met the expenses of the experiment An appropriation has been made to erect permanent buildings and the construction engineer has been engaged as well as instructors in the various mechanical industries They are already on the grounds A construction camp is in progress and within the next month we expect to have more than one hundred of the young men at Harts Island trans ferred to the farm for the purpose of beginning the erection of the permanent plant Before the end of our administration we hope to be able to transfer the entire five hundred young men thus leaving Harts Island ready for the next step in the development of the department which will be the building of an industrial penitentiary on Harts Island Harts Island is too small to be used as an agricultural colony as it contains only about eighty acres but there is ample room for a penitentiary of the type we propose It will be necessary to develop our industries and add to their number This will mean a determination of what industries can be found whose products can be used in the city government Already such studies are under way A plan outlining the proposed development with its probable cost has already been presented to the mayor and the board of estimate and apportionment It is our great ambition to proceed so far with this plan during the present administration as to make its carrying out to completion at least a probability The physical development of the department is less important than the spiritual Along with relief from overcrowding with sanitary conditions and opportunity for educational and industrial training must come opportunities for development of character selfrestraint and selfdirection It is our belief that these oppor tunities will come through the development of the personnel of the department We believe that there is a desire for improvement 574CHARITIES AND CORRECTION on the part of the majority of the prison employes It is exhibited in many quiet and unspectacular ways It is not easy nor can it be done quickly but by encouraging all the good material by the replacing of the material incapable of development or undesir ous of it by careful selection of people not only with training but with ideals we believe we are in the way of a steady development of the department toward the essentials of modem penological theory My personal experiences of thirteen years of work at the New York state reformatory for women at Bedford with women who have broken the law have proved to me the value of experi ment with methods of organization discipline and selfgovernment but conditions in a new institution under ones personal supervision are quite different from those in a department controlling varied institutions with centuryold traditions On taking charge of the department on January 1 1914 I realized that many changes were desirable and set about at once to survey the situation to determine a policy and to plan out our course To this plan we are steadfastly adhering We are willing to experiment but we believe in experimenting slowly and without incurring dangers which come from a too great impatience with difficult conditions and too great anxiety for improvement more rapid than is war ranted by the human and physical machinery at our command If new wine is poured too rapidly into old bottles we know the consequences We believe in progress toward the highest ideals attainable but we believe in making it in a sane and sure fashion which is the surest road to permanent success 575 No 3 97

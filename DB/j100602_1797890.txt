the barometer thermometer and other meteorological instruments and of the winds and weather th roughout that exterlsive region of the southern hemisphere which is either in cluled within the boundaries of this colony or readily accessible from it has determined the South African Literary and Philosophical In stitution to request the assistance of its correspondents and of a11 who may have leisure and inclination for observations of the kirld towards the gradual accumulation of a continued and extensive series of Me teorological Journals and towards carrying into effect a concerted plan of contemporaneous observations on stated days from which it is conceised that much advantage will be derived The institution therefore solicits the attention of its correspondeTlts and of the lovers of knowledge generally to this objectand earnestly requests their cooperation inmakings arranging and forwarding to its secretary resident in Cape Town observations of the natllre and so far as prac

object of local interest and are the only data through which taken in conjunction rith the known laws of physics the more gerleral rela tions of meteorology can be successfully investigated It can scarcely be necessary to insist on the practical importance of this science to the agricultutist to the navigator and indeed to every branch of humarl affairs or to dilate on the benefits which must

is necessary to spread OUI obser lrations over the greatest extent of territzry and the greatest lrariety of local and geographical position It is only by accllmlllating data from the most distant quarters and by comparirlg the affections of the atmosphere at the same installt at diCerent points and at the same point at different moments that it is possible to arrive at distinct and useful conclusions Hence arises the necessity of procuring regular series of observations made on a uniforrn system and comparable with themselves and with each others by observers at diSerent statioxls and of multiplyirlg the points of observation as much as possible over tlle interior surface of continentsalong seacoasts in islands and in the open ocean The geographical yosition of this colony renders

by un avoidable circumstances of absence or from other causes blanks occur no attempt to fill them up by general recollection or by the apparent course of the numbers before and after should evel be made 3 The observations should if possible all be made by one person but as this may often be impracticable the principal oLserver should take care to instruct one or more of his family how to do it and should satisfy himself by many trials that they observe alike 4 The entries in the register should he made at the tinae of ob servation and the numbers entered shoud be those actually read off on the respective scales of each instrumenton no aecount applying to thenl previous to entry any sort vf corlection as for instance for 7Jero for temperature capillarity c All these and the like cor rections heing matter of calculation and reasoning from other ob servatinrls ale to be reserved till the final discussion of the series and for separate letermination axld statement 5 If copies be taken of the registers they should be carefullv com pared with the oriSinals by two lersons one reading aloud from the orioillal and the other attending to tlle copy and then exchanging parts a process always advisable wherever great massee of figures are required to be correctly copiefl 6 A copy so verified or the original the latter being preferred shollld be transmitted reglllarly if possible monthly from places NZithin the limits of the colonv to the Secretary of the South African Literary and Philosophical Society at Cape Town which institution on its part will take care that such documents shall not merely be treasured as a dead letter in its archilres but shall le rendered avail alvle towards the improvement of meteorological knowledge to the full extent of their actual scientific value 7 The register of every instrument should be kept in parts of its ovzn scale as read offno reduction of foIeigIl measllres or degrees to British being made but it sllould of course be stated what scale is used in each instrument VOL 5t 2 BInstructionsfor making and reyzsteriny 370 Of the Times of Observation and Repistry Meteorological observations should be made and registered daily at stated and regular hollrs In fixing on these some sacrifice of system must of necessity be made to the convenience and habits of the ob server The best hours in a scientific point of view lvollld be those of sunrise noon sunsets and midnight and these are the hours for which the registers are kept at the Royal Observatory But these are not the hours adapted to general habits and since the midnight observation is likely to be pretty generally neglected elsewhere than in an astronomical observatorye the following hours for a division of the day into three parts are proposed for what may be deemed the morning afternoon and eening observations viz Morning 8 AM Afternoon 2 PM Evening 8 PM If however the habits or engagements of any one should not allow him to coIlform to these hours rather than not observe he may select his own specifying only what they are at the head of every page of his register and adhering steadily to them in practice only observing to make the extreme observations of each day equidistant from the middle one At the same time it will be borne in mind that in what concerns the great meteorological questions on which the most interesting fea ttlres of the subject depend the night is quite as important as the day and has hitherto beeil far too much neglected To any one therefore who may feel disposed to enter nzore zealously into the subject and mill not consider some personal inconvenience ill under gone for the sake of aSording data of a peculiarly valuable description this Committee would most earIlestly recommend the adoption ir preference tc all othersS of the quartenary dvision of the twenty four hours as follored at the Royal Observatory above alluded to And they leave it to the consideration of the Council whether the keeping and transmission of registers on this principle might not adsTantageously be listlnguished by some honorary reward as that of a medal for instance should the funds of the Institution admit of it AVith a view horever to the better cletermining the laws of the diurnal changes taking place in the atmosphere and to the obtaining a knowledge of the correspondence of its movements and affections over great regions of the earths surface or even over the whole glQbe tEle Comxllittee have resolved to recommend that bur days in eYach year should henceforward be especially set apart by meteorolo gists irl every part of the world and devoted to a most sctupulous and acctarate registry of te state of the barometer and thermometer the direction and force of the wind the quantity character and distri bution of clouds and exrery other particular lf weather throughout the lvhole twentyfour hours of those days and the adjoaning six hours of the days preceding and following The days they have  This is necessary by reason of the want of coincidence of the day in different parts of the globe arising from diffierence of longitude In order to obtain a comMeteorological Observations 371 been induced to fix on and recommend for these observations are the 21st of March the 521st of 3une the 21st of September and the 21st of December being those or immediately adjoirling to those ot the equinoxes and solstices in which the solar influence is either sta tionary or in a state of lnost rapid variation But should any one of those 21st days fall on a Sunday then it tvill be understood that the ob servations are to be deferred till the next day the 22d The observa tion at each station should conzmence at six oclock AM of the appointed days arld terminate at six oclock PM of the days follow ing according to the usual reckoning of time at the place During this interval the barometer and thermometer should be read off and registered hourly or at all events at intervals not more than two hours asunder and the precise hourand minute of each reading should be especially noted For obvious reasons however the commencement of every hour should if practicable be chosen and elrery such series of observa tions should be accompanied by a notice of the means used to obtain the time and when practicable by some observation of an astrono mical nature by which the time can be independenty ascertained within a minute or two As there is scarcely any class of oUserva tions by rhich meteorologv can be more extensively and essentialy promoted it is hoped that not only at every station of importance in this colony but over the shole urorld and on board ships in every part of the ocean individuals will be found to eloperate in this in quiry Every communication of sucl1 observations addressed by channels as seeure and as little expensive as possible to the secretary of this institution will be considered as highly valuabe Of Meteorologiccbl Instruments and first of the Barometer and its attached Thermometer The barometer is the most important of all meteorological instru ments Its office is to measure the actual pressure of tlle atmosphere on a given horizontal surface at the time arld place of observation Its fluctuations are observed to have considerable relation to changes in the weather and especially of the wind Hence its use as a weatherglass A barometer should be examined before setting it up for airbub bles in the tubes and for the existence of air above the mereury in the upper part of the tube This is done by gently inclining the instrument either xvay from the horizontal position a little up and dosvn lvhen airbubbles if large will le seen to run to and fro and plete correspondence of observation for twentyfour stlccessive hotlrs over the whole globe it must be taken into account that opposite longitudes differ twelve hours in their reckolling of time By the arrallgement in the text the whole of the astrono micaSday from noon to noon is emlraced in each series and no observer is re quired to watch two nights in succession  For example the first appearances alld last disappearances of the suns upper and lowel border above alld below the sea herizon it at sea or on the coast or on laIl3 the exact length of the shalow of a sertical object of determinate length on an horizontal level at a precise moment of time not too near noon c e B 2Instrtcotionsfor making and tegistering o72 must be evacuated by inverting the instrument and by gentle blows on it with the hand drixring them up into the cistern If this cannot be done the instrument is useless If air exists to an objectionable amount above the quicksilver it will not tap sharp against the upper end of the tube when the barometer is quickly inclined from a vertical po3ition so as to make the mercury rise abol7e its level neally to the top and then gently jerked lengthways and backwards Jf the blow is pudy and dead or is not heard at allthe amount of air must be considerable and may be expelled by inversion In tixing the barometer choose a good light near a window but not exposed to sunshine in a retired apartment little liable to sudden chantes of temperature ol to draughts of wind Adjust the tube to a vertical position by a plumbline and fix it so as never to shift from that position Before reading off give a few taps on the instrllment enough to make the upper end of the column of quicksilver shake visibly as the mercury is apt to adhere to the glass and give erro rleous readings In reading bring the illdex always opposite to one part flhe correct part to choose is the summit of the convexity of the mercury to whih the index should be made a tangent but if this be diEclllt to hit either from the construction of the index or the ant of a proper fall of light the line of junction of the mercury and glass may be taken In that case the tapping should never be omittel Whichever mode of reading is once adopted should be stated and always adhered to A piece of white paper pleLced behind the upper part of the tube will generally enable any one to read off by the corlvexity of the qllicksilver In placing the index rlotice vhether it appears to shift a little up and down as the eye is raised or depressed This is called Parallax and is a source of uncertainty to lJe avoided by placing the eye in reading always on the exact leuel of the top of the mercurial column Barometric observations require corrections of three kinds and to render them available and comparable xvith others it is necessary that their amount should be ascertained and distinctly stated The first is called tlle Zero Correction It includes seseral subordinate corrections arising from different sources such as that originating in a Sulty placing of the scale of inches that due to the capillary de pression of the mercury in the glass tube and the constant part which at a fixed station is nearly the whole of the depression arising from the presence of air or vapour in the upper part of the tube To determine the zero correction the barometer must be compared with a standard instrllment such as that at tlle Royal OlJservatory for instance r tzorne other hich has been compared with it or with some standard of equal authority Such comparison ought never to be omitted before forwarding the barometel to its place of destina tion nor should any opporturtity be neglected of comparing it when fixed in its place lvith a good portable barometer In making such comparisons all that is necessary is to record the readings of both the instruments after at least an hours quiet exposure side by side that they may have the same temperature If compared by two obMetcorologiccll Obseruations 373 selrrers each sllould read off his oxvn barometer in llis usual manner anl each should take a mean of several readirgs then eacll should rerify the others result By this means the zero of one standard may be transIorted over all the world anl that of all others com pared with it ascertained The amount of the zelo correction is often very large as two or threetenths of an inch but its influence on the mean lwesults of recorded observations falls wholly on the determination of the heights of the station of observation above thfe meau level of the sea and affects little if at all any conclusions of a meteorological nature which may be deduced from them Hence if proper care be taken to preserve a barometer once set up immoveable a long and regular series of observations mrith it has a value independent of any know ledge of this element and it is fortunate hat this is the case as the zero correction is one extremely difficult to determine exactly a priori In transporting a compared barometer to its place of destination great care is necessary It shollld alsrays be carried upright or con siderably inclined and ttlverted and over all rough roads should be carried in the hand to break the shocks to which it would otherwise be exposed If strapped horizontally under the roof of a colonial waggon or tied upright against the woodwork with its head resting on the floor there is not a chance of its escaping destruction Strapped obliquely across the shoulder of a horseman however it travels securely and well and srith common cale in this mode of transport its zero runs no risk of change The next correction and the most important of all is that due to the temperature of the mercury in the bazgometer tube at the time of observation To obtain this every barometer requires to have at tached to it or fixed very near it a thermometer called the attached thermometer xvhich must be read and registered at each obser vation of the barometer It is preferable in practice to read off this thermometer first to avoid the error arisirlg from breathing on or standing long near it mhile reading the lzarometer itself The zero of this thermometer should be ascertainel by comparison with a standard at the temperature of about 60 Fahr The third correction applicable to barometric obser7ations arises from change of level of the mercurial surface in the cistern owing to the transfer of a portion of its contents to or from the tube In barometers sith small cisterns and where the loxver level cannot be adjusted at each observation its amount may be large and its effect being always to make the apparent fluctuation less than the real in a fixed jproportion it ought if possible to be ascertained The data lleeessary to be known arefirst the internal and external diameters of the tube seeondly that of the eistern eontaining the meIcurys at the surfaee where the tube plunges into it These particulars as they must be known to the malier ought to be ilquired of him and indeed ought to be engraved conspicuously on some part of the in strument Although all these corrections are necessary for the strict reductionInstructions for making end reyistering 374 of registered observations they ought not to be applied to individual obsetvations previous to registrAr it is sufficient to know them Their effiect is in most cases easily and safely applicable to mean results and to the conclusions therefrom deduced and a world of troublesome and often mistaken calculations may be saved ly so applying them Of the Ewternal Thermonzeter The external thermometer should have a scale on wllich whole degrees are read oS and disTisions large exlough to admit of estimatirlg tenths or at least quarters of degrees by the eye It should be com pared with a standard and the difference stated at one or more tem peratures the wider asunder the better within the range of the climate in which it is to be used In fixing it choose a perfectly shaded but otherwise free exposure and one where no refected sunbeams from mrater buildings rocks or dry soil can reacll it and easily accessible foI reading There fix it firmly and upright In reading it avoid touchirlt breathing on or in any way warming it by near aIproach of the person The quicker the reading is done the better Although read off at stated times notice should be taken of all sudden and remarkable changes of temperature as indicated by the external theImometer svhenever they occur In the neighbourhood of the Cape and in many other parts of the continent hot winds fre quently set in with great suddenness often in the night and singular alternations of hot and cold temperature occur disturbing the regular laws of the dillrnal fluctuation and connected doubtless svith many interesting tneteorological phenomena peculiar to the climate of South Africa Of the Mawinzum and Minimum or Selfregistering Thermometer This should be placed horsontally in some place out of doors shaded from direct radiation atld rain and otherwise freely exposed to air and so fastened as to 3110w of one end being detached from the fastersing and lifted upX so as to let the intlexes within the boxes slide down to the ends of the fluid columns a more convenient mode when the steel irldex is free enough to allow it than the use of a magnet Both the therrnometers should be read off as early as possible every morning and the indeses readjusted But as double maxima fre quently and occasionally double minima occur in consequence of sudden changes of temperature it is recommended occasionally to in spect both of them with a view to ascertain whether the motion of either the mercury or spirit has been reversed in an unllsual manner and such double maxima or minimaj when remarkable should be recorded as i supernumerary vith their dates and leading features The selfIegistering thermometer i5 extremely apt to get out of order bv tlle indexes becoming entangled in the colunln of IHuid In travelling they should not for a moment be carried with the mercllry bulb downwards if this should happen they ale sure to arrive in a state unfit for use To correct them is tedious arld always hazards fractule With great care however it may be done as follows Meteorological Observations 375 1st The spirlt thermometer By many jerks force the index down to the junction of the bulb and tube then by cautiously heating and cooling alternately the bulb the tube or the airvessel at the top as the case may require the disunited parts of the spirit may be distzlled from place to place till the xvhole is collected in one colulnn in union with the spirit in the bulb 2d The mercurial thermometer When the steel index gets im mersed in the mercury it canlzot be moved by a magnet and lets the mercury pass by its side First cool the lulb hy evaporatiorl of ether if necessary till the mercury is either fairly drawn down below the index or a separation takes place in the column leaving the index with mercury abolTe it Endeavour then by tapping warming the tulJe or by the magnet to loosen the index ever so little then apply heat to the bulb and drive up the index with its superabllndant mer CUIy quite into the airvessel This requires many trials and much patience When there hold the instrument bulb downzYards and suspend the index by a magnet at the top allowing any globule of mercury to drop into the origin of the ttlbe below then heat the bulb cautiously over a very small clear flame of an oillamp till the mer cury rises to the very to of the tube and fairly unites Stith the globule there awaiting it Let the bull cool and the mercury will sink in one united column if not heat it again When this is accomplished the index may be set loose by withdrawing the magnet and restored to its proper position in the tube A selfregistering thermometer may be advantageously left pro perly secured for a whole year or parts of a year on elevated sum mits or other remarkable points to ascertain their masima and minima of temperature during absence In such cases take care to defend them from discovery or accident from wild animals birds snakes c In taking it up for reading off observe not to derange the indexes and do not leave it without seeing that the indexes are in contact and the temperature that of the air at the moment Of Thermometers buried in the Earth Thermometers buried at different depths for the purpose of ex amining the monthly changes of temperature of the soil should have their balls and lower part of the scale xvell wrapped up in lvoollen cloth or pounded charcoal and should be placed in strong earthen vessels which may be entirely withdrawn from the ground so as to allow of inspecting and reading off the scale xvithout exposing the balls to any possibility of changing their temperatures while under examination The vessels should be fitted with coters to defend the scale from injuring in burying and digging up A pipe of earthenware composed of separate pieces or one of wood may be sunk ten or fifteen feet below the surface into dry earth and a thermometer defended as above lorered by a chain The pipe beillg then obstructed at estery two feet by some stuffing readily hooked up the thermometer may be easily examined and a576 Instructions for making and registerzng register of its indications kept with very little trouble In like man ner the tealperature of vells may be registeled Of the Temperalure of the Sea The surfacetemperature of the lYater at sea should be registered as a matter of course rith the same regularity and at the same 2ours as the barometer alld thermometer It is more conveniently and witll quite accuracy enouQh for the purpose obtained by taking up a btacketful of the lvater and stirring round the thermometer irl it Wherlever a change to the extent of 2 Fahr appears to have taken place since the last observation a fresh hucketful should be taken up arld the observation repeated It should also be noticed mrhether rain has fallen siflce the last observation A sudlen depression of 3 or 4 indicates the near approach of land In a voyage from Eng land lately made by a mernber ot this Committee the temperature of the surfacewater fell at once 9 Fahr on approaching within a few miles of the entrance of Table Bay The temperature of the sea at considerable depths can hardly be regarded as a subject of ordinary meteorological inquiry and regular registrr though undoubtedly one of much physical interest fos which reason it is not considered necessary to lwell irther on it Of the Hyyrometer Qc In the absence of Oaniells hygrometer or of ether to cool it the degree of dryness of the air may be ascertained by observing the tem peratures marked by two thermometers suspended fieely side by side but not in contact in the shade and completely defended from a11 radiation to or from the sky the one havin its bulb and stem naked the other with the bllll and Jower part of the stem wrapped in linen or cotton and thoroughly wetted with pure spring or rain water The temperatures indicated by both should be noted rhen the wetted thermometer refuses to sink lossrer and the conclusions left for subse quent caloulations rthe naked thermometer may be the  external thermometer iself in which case a coated thermometel may be  kept always suspended near it completely screened as aboure men tioned axld wetted some minlltes prezzious to the regular daily readings If a hair hygrometer be used its points of absolute moisture and dryness should be frequently ascertained as they are apt to chanre The former may be found by keeping it some time in a close covered jur lirled with wet blottingpaper and harling water in it arld noting the point of moisture beyond whirh it reises to go The latter by keeping it in the sarne mallner in a jar perfectly airtight over ftesh burnt quickliine till it reises to indicate a higher degree of dryness The best measure of the momentawy evaporating potser of the air seems to be the depression of the wetted thermometer below the dry one But the ctotaczl euaXqoration from a given surface is quite another thing and a question may wrery reasonably be raised how far any useful approximation to a knowledge of the total evaporation frqm nMeteorological ObserqJations 377 extensisre and diversified surface unequally moistetled and Grariously exposed to the slln defellled by clouds or refreshed by dews can be obtained ber any small or local experiments The raingauge is an instrument of such extremely easy construc tion that any person lYho lives near a tinman can procure one In a climate so arid as that of AfIica hoveer it HlUSt be lememberel that it lvill often need examination and cleansing owinffl to long in tervals of disuse in which insects nd dust may lodge It will often happen too that the slight rabin of one day if left unregistered will be entirely lost by evaporation in the rlext nay that slight and transient showers may never ellter it being evaporated from it as they fall The effect of copious lewn too must be separated from that of rain so that the mere registry of the contents of the gauge is not of itself a sufiicient indication o7hether rain has fallen in the tlight or no Hosever there are usually good reasons for decisiorl on this point from other indications Attention to the amount of dew is very necessarys not only because the meteorological question3 involved are of a high degree of interest generally but because in arid climates the dezvs are of almost as much ilnportance to the maintenance of vegetation as the rain ln stating the quantity of rain daily received in the gauge the height of the receiver aboxte the soil should be mentioned experience al7ing shown that the quantities of rain vhich actually fall on a given area on the ground and at a ery rnoderate height above it often differ materially In some localities and circumstances the raindrops re ceive accession from the air as they descend in others they undergo partial evaporatioIl The former is generally the case in ool moist climates the latter may be expected in this colintry Ofthe Wind The points most important to remark respecting the wind are 1st Its average intensity and general direction during the several portions of the day dearoted to obselvation and registry 2dlv The hours of the day or night xYhen it commences to blow from a calm or subsides into one from a breeze 3dly The hours at which any remarkable changes of its direction take place 4thlv Tile course which it takes in veering and the quarter in which it ultimately settles 5thly The usual course of periodical qrinds or such as remarkably prevail durirlt certain seasons with the law of their diurnal progress both as to direction and intensity at xvhat hours and by what degrees they commence attain their maximum and subside and through what points of the compass they run in so doing 6thly Tlle existence of crossing currents at different heights in the atmosphere as indicated by the coulse of the clouds in difl7erent strata In observing these it is advisable to fix the exre by some im moveable object as some point of a tree or building the sun or the moon otherwise mistakes are apt to arise378 Instructionsfor making and restering 7thly The times of settingin of remarkably hot or cold winds the quarters from which they come and their courses as connected with the progressive changes in their temperature ssthly The connexion of rainy cIoudy or fair weather vith the quarter from which the wind blows or has blown for some tim previous 9thly The usual character of the winds as to moisture or dryness not as deduced from mere opinion or vague estimation but from actual observation of the hygrometric state of the atmosphere duIing their prevalence Among these particulars it will be seen that some areof a nature susceptible of daily observation and registry while othexs call for an exercise of the combining and inductive faculty on the observers part and cannot be made out otherwise than by contlnued attention and habitual notice of phenomena with a view to the insestigation of their laws The general impression left upon the mind as to any of the points of this kind above enumerated by the occurrences of the past month will therefore be more properly stated in the way of summary remarks at the end of the monthly registers than as entries under palticular days Of the State of the Sky In describing the state of the sky as to couds c the observer u ill bear in mind that it i8 only in that region of the sky which is ver tically above him that the true forms and outlines of the clouds are exlihitedX and the area they cover as well as the interlrals between them distinctly seen As they approach the horizon in any direction their extentis foreshortened by perspective their apparent magnitude diminished by distance and theil intervals covered in and hidden by their mutual interposition In estimating therefore the quantity of clouds in the sky regard must be had to this  and our judgmerlt should rather be formed on a view of the tegion extending from the zenith every way halfdown to the horizon than from the aspect of the heavens below that limit It would be better to notice both and state sepa rately the proportions in which each are covered and the quarter of the horizon towards which the chief masses in the lower region lie The general aspect of clouds as classed under the heads cumulusj eirrus stratus c should be noticed and especially the height of their infeIior surfaces or the level of the vclpour ptane should be esti mated In a mountainous region this is easy so long as the vapour plane is below or not far above the summits cf the hills and in such regions the formation and dissipation of cloud in the neighbourhood of the mollntainsummits under the influence of certain winds form a subject of study of a highly curious and interesting nature The formation of clouds at night during calm weather under the influence of a gradually descending temperature is another point worthy of attention It freqllently happens that without any per ceptible wind the sks will suddenly become hazy in some one point and the hase condetlsing and spreading in all directions without a

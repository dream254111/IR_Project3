derogation of its duty to the public as a common carrier St Joseph etc R Co v Ryan 11 Kan 603 Pa cific R Co v Seely 45 Mo 212 It would seem that a contract by a railroad exempting it from liability for loss by fire caused by the neg ligent operation of its engines on the main track would come within this rule as opposed to public policy Thomason v Kansas City etc R Co 122 La 995 48 South 432 But the contrary has been held Mayfield v Southern Ry 85 S C 165 67 S E 132 When a railroad is not acting in its capacity as a common carrier it has the same rights of contract as other corporations or persons and may therefore contract for immunity from liability for the negligence of itself or servants Missouri K  T R Co v Carter 95 Tex 461 68 S W 159 Thus a railroad may contract with an express company that it shall not be liable for injuries to any of the express messengers due to the negligence of the railroad Baltimore  Ohio etc R Co v Voight 176 U S 498 Where a railroad leases a part of its right of way for the erection of buildings thereon an exemption from liability as to them for loss by fire caused by the engines of the railroad is valid Hartford Ins Co v Chicago etc R Co 175 U S 91 And since a railroad in constructing a spur track is doing something that it is not bound to do by virtue of its character as a common carrier it may validly exempt itself from liability for loss by fire caused by operations on the spur track as such a contract does not operate to the preju dice of the public Mann v Pere Marquette R Co 135 Mich 210 97 N W 721 Mayfield v Southern Ry supra And the same rule applies where a railroad under no obligation to continue the maintenance of a side track but agrees to do so is released from liability for loss by fire Porter v N Y N H  R Co 205 Mass 590 91 N E 875 The doctrine of the principal case appears to be sound but such ex emptions should be held void as contrary to public policy if they ex tend to fires caused by engines operating on the main track and in no way connected with the spur track Thomason v Kansas City etc R Co supra COMMON CARRIERSPASSENGERSDUTY TO AWAKEN AT DESTINATION The plaintiff a passenger on the train of the defendant carrier notified the conductor that owing to his physical condition he might possibly fall asleep The conductor promised accordingly to awaken him at his destination but failed to do so As a consequence the plaintiff was carried past his station and suffered inconvenience therefrom Held the defendant is liable Gilkerson v A C L R Co S C 83 S E 592 See NOTES p 379 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWPEONAGELABOR CONTRACTSA statute provided that a person fined upon conviction for a misdemeanor might confess judgment with a surety in the amount of the fine and costs and might agree with the surety in consideration of the latters payment of the 393394 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW confessed judgment to reimburse him by working for him upon terms approved by the court and that upon a breach of the contract of serv ice the convict should be liable to rearrest a new prosecution and a new fine for the breach Held the statute is unconstitutional since its operation results in a condition of peonage forbidden by the Federal Statutes United States v Reynolds 35 Sup Ct 86 See NoTEs p 385 CONTEMPTWHAT CONSTITUTES CONTEMPTThe defendant who was not an officer of the court did acts in furtherance of a conspiracy to bring a baseless suit He did not bring the suit nor do any thing after suit was brought The suit was dismissed before trial Held the de fendant is not guilty of contempt Melton v Commonwealth Ky 170 S W 37 Direct contempt is some objectionable or disturbing act committed in the presence of the court See Ferriman v People 128 Ill App 230 Neely v State 98 Miss 816 54 South 315 33 L R A N S 138 27 Ann Cas 281 Constructive contempt is some act not done in the presence of the court but which tends to obstruct the administration of justice or bring the court into disrepect See In re Dill 32 Kan 668 5 Pac 39 49 Am Rep 505 Ex parte Clark 208 Mo 121 106 S W 990 15 L R A N S 389 The bringing of a fictitious suit is a contempt of court Coxe v Phillips Hardw 237 See Lord v Veazie 8 How 251 Smith v Junction R Co 29 Ind 546 One who carriers on a pretended controversy by counsel is guilty of contempt See Cleve land v Chamberlain 66 U S 419 Publication even before indictment of matter tending to prevent a fair trial in a future criminal prosecu tion has been held to be contempt Rex v Parke L R 2 K B 1903 432 The defendants act in the principal case undoubtedly comes within some of the broad definitions of constructive contempt adduced by the courts But it is the policy of the law not to extend proceed ings for constructive contempt to cases not coming within the estab lished rules See Haskett v State 51 Ind 176 This seems due to the fact that the proceeding is a summary one and that there is no jury trial The case of Rex v Parke supra seems to be the only case hold ing an act done before any judicial proceedings are instituted to be contempt In that case the defendant had published statements to the effect that one then under arrest for an indictable offense was of bad character and had been guilty of criminal acts in the past The publi cation of such matter would seem to be extremely detrimental to a fair trial in a criminal case and for this reason the holding in Rex v Parke supra seems eminently sound but it would appear to rest upon its own peculiar facts and not to be authority for extending its doc trine beyond cases of that class

he will find easy enough especially in poetry when reading aloud in his chamber I do not think that he should practise on these words except when alone and in the most calm way he needs rather to read naturally as it comes to forget that he stammers and by practice of natural reading and speaking aloud when alone to educate the just coordina tion of the nerves etc I found it best to walk to and fro in my chamber while reading aloud JAMAICA INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION 1891 WE again would call attention to the international exhibition which will be held in the Island of Jamaica in January 1891 un der the auspices of the Government of Jamaica The exhibition building shown in the illustration is 511 feet long with a tran sept 174 feet in length The breadth across nave and aisle is 81 feet and the height is 59 feet In view of the very considerable and increasing trade between the United States and the West Indies the committee have ap propriated a large space for American exhibits and consider this an opportunity which those who are interested in introducing American manufactures and extending the export trade of the United States should not fail to take advantage of No charge fICE 27 ment provided so that those who attend may combine relaxa tion with profitable work The following notes on icebergs and fieldice in the North Atlantic have been prepared principally from information ob tained by Ensign Hugh Rodman USN during his recent trip to Halifax and St Johns By January the body of the ice in terfered seriously with transatlantic navigation and its general southern limit was found in latitude 45 north longitude 48Q 30 west By February it had reached latitude 42 30 north longitude 49 30 west and at present it is in latitude 41 30 north from 50 to 56 west This extreme southern position in January is about two months in advance of the average The Dundee whalers that passed last summer in Greenland waters reported on their arrival home in October and November a very open season in the Arctic with more bergs than had been seen in previous years By August and September these bergs had reached the coast of Labrador and were seen in great numbers in their regular southerly drift in the Arctic current This would account for their appearance near the transatlantic routesv in December and January The past winter has been the most severe both as to temperatures and winds that has been ex perienced for years in Labrador and Newfoundland Ice in the Gulf of St Lawrence has rendered navigation in those waters impossible and the outflow to the southward through Cabot Strait has sent large fields of heavy ice in almost a continuous stieam to the southward and westward since January Much of            C l S s iI   N             X I J2II 5   I E AINA    I JAMAICA INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION BUILDING will be made for space in the exhibition buildings nor will duties be levied on any of the exhibits unless sold in the island The geographical position of the island and the salubrity of the cli mate will undoubtedly attract a large number of visitors from the neighboring islands and South and Central America as well as from the United States There is constant and regular commu nication by steani between New York and Jamaica and the island is also connected with the United States by cable In ad dition to the present accommodations for visitors a large hotel has been recently erected and opened near the exhibition grounds under American management The railroad system of the island which has been recently taken over by an American com pany is rapidly being extended The regulations of the commit tee and full information as to the mode of shipment rates of freight and marking of exhibits and all other particulars as to the scope and object of the exhibition will be furnished by the secretary to the committee for the United States Thomas Amor 280 Broadway New York NOTES AND NEWS THE next annual meeting of the American Society of Mi croscopists will be held in Louisville Ky Aug 12 to 15 inclusive There is such activity on the part of the officers of the society and such interest has been shown by many Southern microscopists that a large meeting is quite assured An in teresting programme will be perfected and a pleasant entertain this ice is four or five feet in thickness rough rafted and close ly packed Fieldice especially when rough is more affected by wind than by current while with bergs the reverse is the case From this it is evident that the drift of the bergs could have been foretold some months ago had early reports been received while the drift of fieldice can best be predicted by telegraphic or other reports that come in promptly to a central office where weather charts are at hand to indicate the force and direction of the wind Following the ice made on the Labrador and Newfoundland coasts comes the Arctic fieldice heavier and more dangerous than the former and its arrival is daily anticipated The quan tity of fieldice to the southward of 44 north will probably grow less from this time on though vessels entering the fields should keep a sharp lookout for heavy deepblue lowfloating pieces of ice called growlers that appear as fragments of bergs or the advance pieces of Arctic ice these mingle with the coast fields at this time and are especially dangerous as they are hard to distinguish Through the exertions of the Hydrographic Office cooperation has been effected with the lighthouse service of New foundland from which monthly reports of ice and weather will hereafter be obtained with the sealing fleet which will prob ably first sight Arctic fieldice with a number of whalers who spend each summer in the Arctic and with the Labrador and Newfoundland fishingfleet From these sources and with a hearty cooperation of masters of vessels sighting ice at sea there seems to be no reason why in future the position of the ice cannot be predicted by the Hydrographic Office with still greater accuracy than hitherto  S

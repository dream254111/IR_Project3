381  XVII FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBLULTE WITH A MODE OF DETER MINING THE BRIGHTNESS OF THESE BODIES BY WILLIAM HUGGINS FRS RECEIVED JANUARY 30READ FEBRUARY 15 1866  I INTRODUCTION IN MY FORMER PAPERS  ON THE SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULE  AND  ON THE SPEC TRUM OF THE GREAT NEBULA IN ORION JI I DESCRIBED THE RESULTS OF A PRISMATIC EXAMINA TION OF THE LIGHT OF SOME OF THE OBJECTS I1 THE HEAVENS WHICH HAVE BEEN CLASSED TOGETHER UNDER THE COMMON DENOMINATION OF NEBULE THE PRESENT PAPER CONTAINS THE RESULTS OF THE APPLICATION OF THE SAME METHOD OF RESEARCH WITH THE SAME APPARATUS TO THE LIGHT OF OTHERS OF THE SAME CLASS OF BODIES TO THESE OBSERVATIONS WITH THE PRISM ARE APPENDED THE RESULTS OF AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE INTRINSIC INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT EMITTED BY SOME OF THE NEBULAE WHICH GIVE A SPECTRUM INDICATING GASEITY ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT FAINTNESS OF THE LIGHT OF MOST OF THE OBJ ECTS DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER I HAVE NOT FOUND IT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE MORE THAN THE GENERAL CHARACTERS OF THE SPECTRA WHICH THEY FORM IN THE INSTRUMENT THE PRESENT OBSERVATIONS CONFIRM THE RESULTS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY NAMELY THAT WITH MY INSTRUMENT CLUSTERS AND NEBULAE GIVE EITHER A SPECTRUM WHICH IS APPARENTLY CONTINUOUS OR A SPECTRUM CONSISTING OF ONE TWO OR THREE BRIGHT LINES THE DESCRIPTION  CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM  IN THIS PAPER AND IN MY FORMER PAPERS MUST NOT BE UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN MORE THAN THAT WHEN THE SLIT WAS MADE AS NARROW AS THE FEEBLE LIGHT OF THE OBJECT PERMITTED THE SPECTRUM WAS NOT RESOLVED INTO BRIGHT LINES WHETHER THE CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM WAS IN ANY CASE INTERRUPTED BY DARK LINES IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE SPECTRA OF THE SUN AND FIXED STARS I WAS NOT ABLE TO ASCERTAIN FOR WHEN THE FEEBLE LIGHT OF A NEBULA IS DISPERSED BY THE PRISM INTO A SPECTRUM CONSISTING OF LIGHT OF ALL REFRANGIBILITIES THE SPECTRUM IS EXTREMELY FAINT AND DIFFICULT OF EXAMINA TION BEFORE THE SLIT IS MADE SUFFICIENTLY NARROW FOR THE DETECTION OF DARK OR BRIGHT LINES THE SPECTRUM BECOMES IN THE CASE OF NEARLY ALL THE OBJECTS EXAMINED TOO FAINT TO BE VISIBLE WHEN HOWEVER A NEBULA IS OBSERVED THE LIGHT OF WHICH IS MONOCHROMATIC OR NEARLY SO THE ONE TWO OR THREE BRIGHT LINES IN WHICH THE LIGHT REMAINS CONCENTRATED CAN USUALLY BE SEEN WHEN THE SLIT IS MADE NARROW SOME OF THESE NEBULAE HAVE BEEN EXAMINED WITH A SLIT NOT EXCEEDING 3L OF AN INCH IN WIDTH A CONCLUSION OF SOME IMPORTANCE TO OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF THESE BODIES AND ESPECIALLY OF VALUE IN REFERENCE TO THE THEORETICAL VIEWS WE MAY FORM OF THE RELATION OF THE GASEOUS NEBULAE TO THE OTHER NEBULE AND CLUSTERS PRESENTS ITSELF IN CON  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1864 P 437 T PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY VOL XIV P 39 MDCCCLXVI 3 G382 MR W ILUGGINS ON THE SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULAR NEXION WITH THESE OBSERVATIONS THE INTENSITY OF THE BRIGHTEST LINE OF THE GASEOUS NEBULA IS IN MOST CASES GREATER THAN THE INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT OF THE SAME REFTRANITBILITY OF THOSE NEBULAE AND CLUSTERS WHICH FURNISH A SPECTRUM WHICH IS APPARENTLY CONTINUOUS THE SUPERIOR INTENSITY OF THE LIGHT MAY INDICATE A MORE INTENSE HEAT IT MAY BE THERE FORE THAT OF ALL THE OBJECTS USUALLY CLASSED UNDER THE DENOMINATION OF NEBULH AND CLUSTERS THOSE WHICH GIVE A GASEOUS SPECTRUM ARE AS A CLASS TO BE REGARDED AS THE HOTTESTJUNE 1866 THE CONTINUOUS SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULA AND CLUSTERS ARE IRREGULARLY BRIGHT IN SOME PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM BUT WHEN THE WIDTH OF THE SLIT WAS REDUCED THE BRIGHT PORTIONS DID NOT APPEAR TO BECOME MORE DEFINED AS WOULD BE THE CASE WITH A SPECTRUM CONTAINING BRIGHT LINES  THIS IRREGULARITY OF BRIGHTNESS MAY PERHAPS BE DUE IN SOME CASES TO THE PROBABLE MODE OF FORMATION OF THESE CONTINUOUS SPECTRA IN THE CASE AT LEAST OF THE CLUSTERS WHICH THE TELESCOPE RESOLVES INTO STELLAR POINTS THE SPECTRUM MUST BE COMPOSED OF THE BLENDING TOGETHER OF THE SPECTRA OF THE CONSTITUENT BRIGHT POINTS NOW IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT THESE COMPONENT SPECTRA LIKE THE SPECTRA OF THE STARS DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER IN THE RELATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF THEIR DIFFERENT PARTS TBE POSITIONS IN THE SPECTRUM OF THE BRIGHT LINES OF THE GASEOUS NEBULE DESCRIBED IN MY FORMER PAPER WERE DETERMINED BY A SIMULTANEOUS COMPARISON IN THE INSTRUMENT OF THESE LINES WITH THE BRIGHT LINES OF NITROGEN HYDROGEN AND BARIUM THE BRIGHT LINES OF THE GASEOUS NEBULA REFERRED TO IN THIS PAPER WERE NOT COMPARED DIRECTLY WITH ANY TERRESTRIAL SPECTRA PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT FAINTNESS OF MOST OF THESE OBJECTS AND PARTLY BECAUSE THE FORMER COMPARISONS WERE FOUND TO BE INJURIOUSLY FATIGUING TO THE EYE THE VALUE OF THIS APPLICATION OF SPECTRUM ANALYSIS APPEARS TO ME TO CONSIST CHIEFLY IN THE ASSISTANCE WHICH THIS METHOD OF OBSERVATION MAY AFFORD US IN ASCERTAINING THE TRUE NATURE OF THE NEBULE AND THE RELATION WHICH THEY SUSTAIN TO THE OTHER ORDERS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES I HAVE THEREFORE ADDED TO MY PRISMATIC OBSERVATIONS SUCH OF THE  THE PECULIAR APPEARANCE OF THE CONTINUOUS SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULA AND CLUSTERS HAS SUGGESTED TO ME FROM MY FIRST EXAMINATION OF THEM THAT POSSIBLY THE LUMINOUS POINTS INTO WHICH THE TELESCOPE RESOLVES SOME OF THESE OBJECTS MAY NOT BE OF THE SAME NATURE AS THE TRUE STARS MY OBSERVATIONS OF THE GREAT NEBULA IN ANDRO MEDA AND OF ITS SMALL BUT BRIGHT COMPANION IN AUGUST 1864 WERE RECORDED THUS  THE SPECTRUM APPEARS TO END ABRUPTLY IN THE ORANGE AND THROUGHOUT ITS LENGTH IS NOT UNIFORM BUT IS EVIDENTLY CROSSED EITHER BY LINES OF ABSORPTION OR BY BRIGHT LINES  THE SAME CHARACTERS HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND IN SEVERAL OF THE BRIGHTER NEBULA AND CLUSTERS IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF THE LESS REFRANGIBLE RAYS WHICH ARE WANTING IN THESE SPECTRA BY SUPPOSING THEM TO HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED BY ABSORBENT VAPOURS THE APPARENTLY COMPLETE WANT OF LIGHT IN THIS PART OF THE SPECTRUM AND THE UNEQUAL MOTTLED APPEARANCE OF THE BRIGHTER PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM SUGGEST RATHER THAT THE LIGHT MAY HAVE EMANATED FROM A GASEOUS SOURCE AND THAT THE SPECTRUM CONSISTS OF NUMEROUS BRIGHT LINES THE FAINTNESS OF THESE SPECTRA HAS PREVENTED ME FROM USING A SLIT SUFFICIENTLY NARROW FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THEIR TRUE NATURE SOME QUITE RECENT OBSERVATIONS WHICH ARE NOT YET COMPLETE APPEAR TO SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT THE BRIGHT POINTS OF SOME CLUSTERS MAY POSSESS A PHYSICAL CONSTITUTION WHICH IS NOT ANALOGOUS TO THAT

OPINION WOULD BE OF ASSISTANCE TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NEW INFORMATION FURNISHED BY THE PRISM ALTHOUGH THE DETECTION IN A NEBULA BY THE TELESCOPE OF CLOSELY ASSOCIATED POINTS OF LIGHT CAN NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS A TRUSTWORTHY INDICATION THAT THE OBJECT CONSISTS OF TRUE STARS YET IT IS OF IMPORTANCE TO ASCERTAIN HOW FAR THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE NEBULAE BY THE PRISM

IMPORTANCE TO THE THEORIES OF COSMICAL SCIENCE A FIRST CONSIDERATION OF THESE NEBULAE WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE NOW EVIDENCE FROM OBSERVATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THAT PRIMORDIAL NEBULOUS MATTER REQUIRED BY THE THEORIES OF SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL AND LAPLACE BUT THOUGH IT SHOULD BE FOUND ULTI MATELY THAT IN SOME OF ITS FORMS THE THEORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AERIFORM MATTER INTO SUNS AND PLANETS IS A TRUE REPRESENTATION OF THE MODE OF FORMATION OF THE UNIVERSE STILL IT WOULD SHOW A WANT OF THE STRICT CAUTION WHICH EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE DEMANDS IN THE INTERPRETATION OF OBSERVED FACTS TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENA PRESENTED BY THE GASEOUS NEBULHE IN CONNEXION WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF A THEORY WHICH AT PRESENT IS NOT MORE THAN A SPECULATION IN A PAPER  ON THE SPECTRUM OF THE GREAT NEBULA IN ORIONT I STATED AS THE RESULT OF THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH I HAD THEN MADE THE PROVISIONAL OPINION THAT THE GASEOUS NEBULAE MAY BELONG POSSIBLY TO AN ORDER OF COSMICAL BODIES DISTINCT FROM THAT REPRESENTED BY THE SUN AND FIXED STARS IN THIS CONNEXION IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT MY EXAMINATION OF THE LIGHT OF COMET I 1866  SHOWS THAT A CLOSE RELATION PROBABLY EXISTS BETWEEN NEBULAR AND COMETARY MATTER AS FURTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS A FUTURE DETERMINATION OF THE TRUE RANK AND COSMICAL RELATIONS OF THESE NEBULA I PROCEED TO GIVE THE RESULTS OF SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE INTENSITY OF THEIR LIGHT AND ALSO MEASURES OF SOME OF THE PLANETARY NEBULE  IV ON A MODE OF DETERMINING THE BRIGHTNESS OF SOME OF THE NEBUYLE AS LONG AS THE NEBULK WERE REGARDED AS AGGREGATIONS OF DISCRETE STARS SEPARATELY INVISIBLE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE BY ANY PHOTOMETRIC ESTIMATION OF THE LIGHT FROM THEM WHICH REACHES THE EARTH TO ASCERTAIN THE INTRINSIC BRILLIANCY OF THE SUNS OF WHICH THE NEBULAV WERE SUPPOSED TO CONSIST FOR SINCE THESE STARS HAVE NO SENSIBLE MAGNITUDE EVEN WHEN SEPARATELY VISIBLE THEIR INTRINSIC SPLENDOUR COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED FROM THEIR BRIGHTNESS TO AN OBSERVER ON THE EARTH SO LONG AS THEIR DISTANCE FROM OUR SYSTEM REMAINED UNKNOWN NOW HOWEVER THAT THE APPLICATION OF PRISMATIC ANALYSIS TO THE LIGHT OF THE NEBULAE HAS SHOWN THAT SOME OF THESE OBJECTS CONSIST OF LUMINOUS GAS EXISTING IN MASSES WHICH ARE PROBABLY CONTINUOUS THOUGH INDEED IN SOME CASES THIS AERIFORM MATTER APPEARS TO BE AGGREGATED INTO PORTIONS OF UNEQUAL BRILLIANCY THE INTRINSIC BRIGHTNESS OF THESE NEBULKE MAY BE ESTIMATED FROM THE EARTH THOUGH THEIR DISTANCE FROM US IS UNKNOWN THE NEBULAE ARE NOT POINTS WITHOUT SENSIBLE MAGNITUDE IN THE TELESCOPE BUT PRESENT SUR FACES IN SOME CASES SUBTENDING A CONSIDERABLE ANGLE THE BRILLIANCY OF A LUMINOUS SURFACE WHEN BEYOND THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE DOES NOT VARY WITH ITS DISTANCE FROM THE OBSERVER EXCEPT AS IT MAY BE DIMINISHED BY A POSSIBLE POWER OF EXTINCTION BELONGING TO CELESTIAL SPACE FOR THE DIMINUTION OF BRIGHTNESS OF A LUMINOUS SURFACE AS IT BECOMES  A COSMICAL THEORY WHICH MAY PERHAPS BE DESCRIBED AS THE CONVERSE OF THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS HAS BEEN RECENTLY

ITS ORIGINAL BRIGHTNESS UNALTERED IF THEREFORE THE LIGHT OF THESE NEBULAE BE COMPARED WITH A LUMINOUS BODY ON THE EARTH WE CAN OBTAIN APPROXI MATELY THE INTRINSIC INTENSITY OF THEIR LIGHT IN TERMS EXPRESSING A PROPORTION TO THE TER RESTRIAL LIGHT SELECTED FOR COMPARISON THE VALUES OF THE INTRINSIC BRILLIANCY OF THE NEBULAE OBTAINED IN THIS WAY MUST BE SMALLER THAN THE TRUE AMOUNT BECAUSE THEY ARE MEASURES OF THE LIGHT AFTER IT HAS TRAVERSED AN UNKNOWN EXTENT OF CELESTIAL SPACE AND HAS PASSED THROUGH THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE THE AMOUNT BY WHICH FROM THESE CAUSES THE ESTIMATED BRIGHTNESS OF THE NEBULAE WOULD BE TOO SMALL MUST REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT UNKNOWN SINCE WE HAVE NO DATA BY WHICH THIS LOSS COULD BE EVEN ESTIMATED NOTWITHSTANDING THESE ERRORS OF UNKNOWN AMOUNT WITH WHICH THE RESULTS OF A COM PARISON OF THE NEBULA WITH A TERRESTRIAL SOURCE OF LIGHT MUST STAND AFFECTED AN ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER EVEN APPROXIMATELY THE INTRINSIC BRIGHTNESS OF THE GASEOUS NEBULAE HAS SOME IMPORTANCE IN CONNEXION WITH THE PHYSICAL CONSTITUTION WHICH PRISMATIC ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN THESE OBJECTS TO POSSESS THE COINCIDENCE OF TWO OF THE THREE LINES FORMING THE SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULAE SEVERALLY WITH A LINE OF HYDROGEN AND THE BRIGHTEST LINE OF NITROGEN APPEARS TO INDICATE THAT THEY CONSIST OF AERIFORM MATTER HIGHLY TRANSPARENT BODIES SUCH AS THESE GASES ARE EMIT WHEN HEATED BUT A FEEBLE LIGHT COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH WOULD BE RADIATED AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE BY MORE OPAKE BODIES THE INVISI BILITY OF THESE NEBULAE TO THE NAKED EYE THOUGH SOME OF THEM ARE OF CONSIDERABLE APPARENT SIZE SHOWS THAT THEY POSSESS A VERY FEEBLE DEGREE OF LUMINOSITYT BESIDES THESE CONSIDERATIONS BY MEANS OF SIMILAR PHOTOMETRIC OBSERVATIONS MADE AT CONSIDERABLE INTERVALS OF TIME IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE INTRINSIC BRIGHTNESS OF THE GASEOUS NEBULAE IS UNDERGOING INCREASE OR DIMINUTION OR IS SUBJECT TO A PERIODIC VARIATION  IN 1744 CEIES3AUX WAS LED BY THEORETICAL SPECULATIONS TO ASSUME THAT LIGHT IS GRADUALLY EXTINGUISHED IN ITS PASSAGE THROUGH SPACE BY SOMEWHAT SIMILAR REASONING OLBERS IN 1823 ASSUMED THAT A STAR LOSES THE 1 OF ITS INTENSITY IN TRAVERSING A DISTANCE OF SPACE EQUAL TO

DASTRONOMIE STELLAIRE P 89 A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE REASONING BY WHICH STRJVE OBTAINED THESE VALUES WAS THAT THE STARS ARE DISTANT FROM OUR SYSTEM IN THE INVERSE RATIO OF THEIR APPARENT BRIGHTNESS

HAS BEEN SHOWN NOT TO BE TRUE IN THE CASES IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN CONFRONTED WITH OBSERVATION T IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE INTRINSIC SPLENDOUR OF THEIR SURFACES IF CONTINUOUS MUST BE ALMOST INFINITELY LESS

NEUTRALTINT GLASS THIS INSTRUMENT WHICH IS ADAPTED TO THE EYEEND OF MY ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE CONSISTS ESSENTIALLY FIRST OF A DIAPHRAGM DRILLED WITH SMALL HOLES MOVEABLE WITHIN THE FOCUS OF THE TELESCOPE WHICH DIMINISHES THE APERTURE OF THE TELESCOPE IN PROPORTION AS IT IS ADVANCED TOWARDS THE OBJECTGLASS AND SECONDLY OF TWO GRADUATED WEDGES OF NEUTRALTINT GLASS WHICH SLIDE IN FRONT OF THE CONVEX LENSES WITH WHICH THE FOCAL IMAGE IS VIEWED THE APERTURE IN THE DIAPHRAGM WHICH WAS USED IN THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS HAS A DIAMETER OF O0O6 INCH THE DIAPHRAGM IS MOVED BY A SCREW AND ITS POSITION IS READ OFF UPON A SCALE DIVIDED INTO TENTHS OF AN INCH THE PHOTOMETER WEDGES ARE 4 INCHES IN LENGTH AND DIVIDED INTO FORTY PARTS THE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE IN THE FOLLOWING WAY THE DIAPHRAGM WAS PLACED SO THAT ALL THE PENCILS FROM THE OBJECTGLASS PASSED THROUGH THE SMALL APERTURE WITHOUT DIMINUTION THE NEBULHE WERE VIEWED THROUGH THE WEDGES OF NEUTRALTINT GLASS THESE WERE MADE TO SLIDE BEFORE THE EYE UNTIL THE EXACT PART OF ONE OF THE WEDGES WAS FOUND AT WHICH THE NEBULA WAS EXTINGUISHED ON AUGUST 25 1865 A NIGHT OF MORE THAN USUAL CLEARNESS SEVERAL ESTIMATIONS WERE MADE OF EACH OF THE THREE NEBULHE NO 4628 1 H IV THE ANNULAR NEBULA IN LYRA AND THE DUMBBELL NEBULA IN EACH CASE THE ESTIMATION APPLIES TO THE BRIGHTEST PART OF THE NEBULA THE SOURCE OF LIGHT SELECTED AS A STANDARD

DIAPHRAGM FOR THIS PURPOSE A THICK PLATE WITH PARALLEL SIDES OF NEUTRALTINT GLASS WAS PLACED BEFORE THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE AN EXAMINATION OF THE NEUTRALTINT GLASS WITH A PRISM SHOWED THAT THE ABSORPTIVE POWER OF THE GLASS FOR ALL REFRANGIBILITIES IN THE BRIGHTER PORTIONS OF THE SPECTRUM WAS VERY NEARLY UNIFORM THE AMOUNT OF DIMINUTION OF THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE EFFECTED BY THE PLATE OF NEUTRAL GLASS WAS MEASURED BY A BUNSENS PHOTOMETER WHEN THE LIGHT PASSED THROUGH THE NEUTRAL GLASS THE CANDLE REQUIRED TO BE PLACED AT A DISTANCE OF 6 5 INCHES TO CAUSE THE UNGREASED CENTRAL SPOT OF

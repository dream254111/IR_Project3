381  XVII Further Observations on the Spectra of some of the Neblulte with a Mode of deter mining the Brightness of these Bodies By WILLIAM HUGGINS FRS Received January 30Read February 15 1866  I Introduction IN my former papers  On the Spectra of some of the Nebule  and  On the Spec trum of the Great Nebula in Orion jI I described the results of a prismatic examina tion of the light of some of the objects i1 the heavens which have been classed together under the common denomination of Nebule The present paper contains the results of the application of the same method of research with the same apparatus to the light of others of the same class of bodies To these observations with the prism are appended the results of an attempt to determine the intrinsic intensity of the light emitted by some of the nebulae which give a spectrum indicating gaseity On account of the great faintness of the light of most of the obj ects described in this paper I have not found it possible to determine more than the general characters of the spectra which they form in the instrument The present observations confirm the results which I have already presented to the Royal Society namely that with my instrument clusters and nebulae give either a spectrum which is apparently continuous or a spectrum consisting of one two or three bright lines The description  continuous spectrum  in this paper and in my former papers must not be understood to mean more than that when the slit was made as narrow as the feeble light of the object permitted the spectrum was not resolved into bright lines Whether the continuous spectrum was in any case interrupted by dark lines in a manner similar to the spectra of the sun and fixed stars I was not able to ascertain for when the feeble light of a nebula is dispersed by the prism into a spectrum consisting of light of all refrangibilities the spectrum is extremely faint and difficult of examina tion Before the slit is made sufficiently narrow for the detection of dark or bright lines the spectrum becomes in the case of nearly all the objects examined too faint to be visible When however a nebula is observed the light of which is monochromatic or nearly so the one two or three bright lines in which the light remains concentrated can usually be seen when the slit is made narrow Some of these nebulae have been examined with a slit not exceeding 3L of an inch in width A conclusion of some importance to our interpretation of the phenomena of these bodies and especially of value in reference to the theoretical views we may form of the relation of the gaseous nebulae to the other nebule and clusters presents itself in con  Philosophical Transactions 1864 p 437 t Proceedings of the Royal Society vol xiv p 39 MDCCCLXVI 3 G382 MR W ilUGGINS ON THE SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULAR nexion with these observations The intensity of the brightest line of the gaseous nebula is in most cases greater than the intensity of the light of the same reftranitbility of those nebulae and clusters which furnish a spectrum which is apparently continuous The superior intensity of the light may indicate a more intense heat It may be there fore that of all the objects usually classed under the denomination of nebulh and clusters those which give a gaseous spectrum are as a class to be regarded as the hottestJune 1866 The continuous spectra of some of the nebula and clusters are irregularly bright in some parts of the spectrum but when the width of the slit was reduced the bright portions did not appear to become more defined as would be the case with a spectrum containing bright lines  This irregularity of brightness may perhaps be due in some cases to the probable mode of formation of these continuous spectra In the case at least of the clusters which the telescope resolves into stellar points the spectrum must be composed of the blending together of the spectra of the constituent bright points Now it is not improbable that these component spectra like the spectra of the stars differ from each other in the relative brightness of their different parts Tbe positions in the spectrum of the bright lines of the gaseous nebule described in my former paper were determined by a simultaneous comparison in the instrument of these lines with the bright lines of nitrogen hydrogen and barium The bright lines of the gaseous nebula referred to in this paper were not compared directly with any terrestrial spectra partly because of the great faintness of most of these objects and partly because the former comparisons were found to be injuriously fatiguing to the eye The value of this application of spectrum analysis appears to me to consist chiefly in the assistance which this method of observation may afford us in ascertaining the true nature of the nebule and the relation which they sustain to the other orders of the heavenly bodies I have therefore added to my prismatic observations such of the  The peculiar appearance of the continuous spectra of some of the nebula and clusters has suggested to me from my first examination of them that possibly the luminous points into which the telescope resolves some of these objects may not be of the same nature as the true stars My observations of the great nebula in Andro meda and of its small but bright companion in August 1864 were recorded thus  The spectrum appears to end abruptly in the orange and throughout its length is not uniform but is evidently crossed either by lines of absorption or by bright lines  The same characters have since been found in several of the brighter nebula and clusters It is possible to explain the absence of the less refrangible rays which are wanting in these spectra by supposing them to have been intercepted by absorbent vapours The apparently complete want of light in this part of the spectrum and the unequal mottled appearance of the brighter parts of the spectrum suggest rather that the light may have emanated from a gaseous source and that the spectrum consists of numerous bright lines The faintness of these spectra has prevented me from using a slit sufficiently narrow for the determination of their true nature Some quite recent observations which are not yet complete appear to support the view that the bright points of some clusters may possess a physical constitution which is not analogous to that of the sugn and the brighter of the separate starsJune 1866 Philosophical Transactions 1864 p 442MR W HUGGINS ON THE SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULX 383 results of former telescopic observation as in my opinion would be of assistance to an understanding of the proper significance of the new information furnished by the prism Although the detection in a nebula by the telescope of closely associated points of light can no longer be regarded as a trustworthy indication that the object consists of true stars yet it is of importance to ascertain how far the classification of the nebulae by the prism corresponds with the telescopic indications of their resolvability I have Lord RossEs permission to state that the matter of the Great Nebula in Orion which the prism shows to be gaseous has not been resolved by his telescope In some parts of the nebula he observed a large number of exceedingly minute red stars These red stars however though apparently connected with the irresolvable blue material of the nebula yet seem to be distinct from it The light of these stars is doubtless too feeble to furnish a visible spectrum Lord OxMANTOWN has examined all the observations made at Parsonstown of

1866 I examined this nebula with my refractor of 8 inches aperture Powers of 600 and 920 diameters showed that the nebula is annular It appears to consist of an oval ring of brighter matter surrounded by a broad margin of faint nebu losity The area enclosed by the ring like that of the annular nebula in Lyra is filled with faintly luminous matter The faint nebulosity surrounding the ring appears cir cular or nearly so suggesting that the ring seen obliquely from our system exists within a globular mass of faint nebulous material When the spectroscope was applied in addition to the bright line seen in 1865 the two other bright lines which are present in many nebula were also observed When the slit was made sufficiently narrow for these bright lines to appear defined no trace of a continuous

importance to the theories of cosmical science A first consideration of these nebulae would suggest that we have now evidence from observation of the existence of that primordial nebulous matter required by the theories of Sir WILLIAM HERSCHEL and LAPLACE But though it should be found ulti mately that in some of its forms the theory of the development of aeriform matter into suns and planets is a true representation of the mode of formation of the universe still it would show a want of the strict caution which experimental science demands in the interpretation of observed facts to explain the phenomena presented by the gaseous nebulhe in connexion with the requirements of a theory which at present is not more than a speculation In a paper  On the Spectrum of the Great Nebula in Oriont I stated as the result of the observations which I had then made the provisional opinion that the gaseous nebulae may belong possibly to an order of cosmical bodies distinct from that represented by the sun and fixed stars In this connexion it may be remarked that my examination of the light of Comet I 1866  shows that a close relation probably exists between nebular and cometary matter As further contributions towards a future determination of the true rank and cosmical relations of these nebula I proceed to give the results of some observations on the intensity of their light and also measures of some of the planetary nebule  IV On a Mode of determining the Brightness of some of the Nebuyle As long as the nebulk were regarded as aggregations of discrete stars separately invisible it was not possible by any photometric estimation of the light from them which reaches the earth to ascertain the intrinsic brilliancy of the suns of which the nebulav were supposed to consist For since these stars have no sensible magnitude even when separately visible their intrinsic splendour could not be estimated from their brightness to an observer on the earth so long as their distance from our system remained unknown Now however that the application of prismatic analysis to the light of the nebulae has shown that some of these objects consist of luminous gas existing in masses which are probably continuous though indeed in some cases this aeriform matter appears to be aggregated into portions of unequal brilliancy the intrinsic brightness of these nebulke may be estimated from the earth though their distance from us is unknown The nebulae are not points without sensible magnitude in the telescope but present sur faces in some cases subtending a considerable angle The brilliancy of a luminous surface when beyond the earths atmosphere does not vary with its distance from the observer except as it may be diminished by a possible power of extinction belonging to celestial space For the diminution of brightness of a luminous surface as it becomes  A cosmical theory which may perhaps be described as the converse of the nebular hypothesis has been recently suggested by Professor E W BRAYLEY see Proceedings of the Royal Society vol xiv p 120 t Proceedings of the Royal Society vol xiv p 39  Ibid vol xv p 5MR W HUGGINS ON THE SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULA 393 more distant takes place in the same proportion as the surface decreases in apparent magnitude as long therefore as a distant object remains of sensible size in the tele scope the object retains its original brightness unaltered If therefore the light of these nebulae be compared with a luminous body on the earth we can obtain approxi mately the intrinsic intensity of their light in terms expressing a proportion to the ter restrial light selected for comparison The values of the intrinsic brilliancy of the nebulae obtained in this way must be smaller than the true amount because they are measures of the light after it has traversed an unknown extent of celestial space and has passed through the earths atmosphere The amount by which from these causes the estimated brightness of the nebulae would be too small must remain for the present unknown since we have no data by which this loss could be even estimated Notwithstanding these errors of unknown amount with which the results of a com parison of the nebula with a terrestrial source of light must stand affected an attempt to discover even approximately the intrinsic brightness of the gaseous nebulae has some importance in connexion with the physical constitution which prismatic analysis has shown these objects to possess The coincidence of two of the three lines forming the spectra of some of the nebulae severally with a line of hydrogen and the brightest line of nitrogen appears to indicate that they consist of aeriform matter Highly transparent bodies such as these gases are emit when heated but a feeble light compared with that which would be radiated at the same temperature by more opake bodies The invisi bility of these nebulae to the naked eye though some of them are of considerable apparent size shows that they possess a very feeble degree of luminosityt Besides these considerations by means of similar photometric observations made at considerable intervals of time it would be possible to ascertain whether the intrinsic brightness of the gaseous nebulae is undergoing increase or diminution or is subject to a periodic variation  In 1744 CEiEs3AuX was led by theoretical speculations to assume that light is gradually extinguished in its passage through space By somewhat similar reasoning OLBERS in 1823 assumed that a star loses the 1 of its intensity in traversing a distance of space equal to that which separates Sirius from the suntOber die Durchsiehtigkeit des Weltraums BoDEs Jahrbuch 1826 s 110121 The elder STRUvE from an examination of Sir W HE RSCHELS telescopic gauges of the Milky Way supposed that a star of the sixth magnitude has lost 7 of its original intensity a star of the ninth magnitude  and the smallest star visible in Sir WILLIAM IERSCHELS telescope 180I Etudes dAstronomie Stellaire p 89 A fundamental element of the reasoning by which STRJvE obtained these values was that the stars are distant from our system in the inverse ratio of their apparent brightness Since however the stars to which observation assigns the largest parallax 61 Cygni and a Centauri are less bright than other stars in which no parallax or a much smaller one only has been detected not to refer to what may be regarded as an exceptional case the great inequality in magnitude of some binary stars this assumption that the apparent brightness of stars depends alone upon their distance has been shown not to be true in the cases in which it has been confronted with observation t It is evident that the intrinsic splendour of their surfaces if continuous must be almost infinitely less than that of the sunSir JoHN HERSCHEL Outlines of Astronomy p 646 7th edit394 MR W HUGGINS ON THE SPECTRA OF SOME OF THE NEBULX For the purpose of making these observations I had constructed by Mr G DOLLOND an instrument in which are combined two forms of apparatus contrived by the Rev W R DAWES FRS and described by him under the names of An aperturediminishing eyepiece and A Photometer of Neutraltint Glass This instrument which is adapted to the eyeend of my achromatic telescope consists essentially first of a diaphragm drilled with small holes moveable within the focus of the telescope which diminishes the aperture of the telescope in proportion as it is advanced towards the objectglass and secondly of two graduated wedges of neutraltint glass which slide in front of the convex lenses with which the focal image is viewed The aperture in the diaphragm which was used in the following observations has a diameter of O0O6 inch The diaphragm is moved by a screw and its position is read off upon a scale divided into tenths of an inch The photometer wedges are 4 inches in length and divided into forty parts The observations were made in the following way The diaphragm was placed so that all the pencils from the objectglass passed through the small aperture without diminution The nebulhe were viewed through the wedges of neutraltint glass These were made to slide before the eye until the exact part of one of the wedges was found at which the nebula was extinguished On August 25 1865 a night of more than usual clearness several estimations were made of each of the three nebulhe No 4628 1 H IV the annular nebula in Lyra and the Dumbbell nebula In each case the estimation applies to the brightest part of the nebula The source of light selected as a standard of comparison was a sperm candle of the size known as 4 six to the pound The rate of burning of this candle on three occasions was August 26  35 minutes lost in weight 132 grs 1578 grs per hour 31  38   7 l42grs 160O8grs 5 September 7  41    148grs 1578grs It was found necessary to diminish greatly the light of the candle in order to bring it within the range of comparison afforded by the moveable diaphragm For this purpose a thick plate with parallel sides of neutraltint glass was placed before the flame of the candle An examination of the neutraltint glass with a prism showed that the absorptive power of the glass for all refrangibilities in the brighter portions of the spectrum was very nearly uniform The amount of diminution of the light of the candle effected by the plate of neutral glass was measured by a BUNSENS photometer When the light passed through the neutral glass the candle required to be placed at a distance of 6 5 inches to cause the ungreased central spot of the photo meter to disappear Without the glass the disappearance took place when the candle  Monthly Notices Royal Astronomical Society vol xxv p 229MR W HUGGINS ON THE SPECTRA OF SOMIE OF THE NEBULA 395 was removed to a distance of 12625 inches The disappearance was viewed with a small telescope The numbers adopted are the mean of several observations the close accordance of which showed that the fixed light behind the screen had remained of constant intensity The ratio of the squares of the distances shows that the light of the candle was reduced by the neutraltint glass to the  part of its original intensity The candle placed in a lantern and screened by the neutraltint glass was fixed on the roof of a house at a distance of 440 yards from the observatory It was desirable that the candle should be at some distance in order that its image in the telescope should be formed at nearly the same distance from the objectglass as the images of celestial objects Besides it was convenient that the flame of the candle should appear small when viewed with the convex lens magnifying on the telescope 101 diameters with which the nebule had been observed The image of the flame of the candle in the telescope was viewed through the same parts of the wedges of neutraltint glass at which the nebule bad been observed to become invisible By means of the moveable diaphragms and also independently by means of diaphragms placed before the objectglass the apertures of the objectglass were found at which the flame of the candle became extinguished at the parts of the wedges at which the nebule had been observed to disappear Sept 7 1865 Jan 19 1866 Aperture corresponding to nebula in Lyra   2X09 inches 200 inches Dumbbell nebula 106 inch 1P20 inch Nebula No 4628 1 H IV 4 0 inches

connexion with these values of the intensity of the light of these nebulh that nebula No 4628 gives a spectrum of three bright lines and also a faint continuous spectrum The nebula in Lyra and the Dumbbell nebula give one bright line only  V Measures of some of the Neblulw If great physical changes such as subsidence and condensation of the magnitude necessary for the conversion of the nebulae into suns are taking place in these objects an indication of the advance of these processes might perhaps be obtained by measure ments taken at considerable intervals of such of the nebulk as are suitable for this purpose There are several of the planetary nebulae which give a gaseous spectrum which in telescopes of moderate power have disks sufficiently well defined for micro metric measurement Measures of these nebulao would be comparable with future measures obtained with telescopes of similar power Some months since I invited the Rev W R DAWES FRS to take measures of the diameters of several of these objects Ill health has unfortunately prevented him from measuring more than one nebula No 4234 5 Mr DAWES writes  So bright and yet so imperfectly defined like the heads of some comets The moon was near the horizon yet I found that I could get hold of more of it with high powers than with lower It appeared rather suddenly to fade away at the edges and to have a sort of faint halo round it which however was not distinctly separate from the brighter centre I obtained four sets of measures of the diameter which was parallel to the equator but thought that the form was rather elliptic the equatorial diameter being the greater The four sets were obtained with powers 148 218 292 and 382 that with 148 appearing to be far less certain than the others The illumination of the field necessary to show the wires with power 148 seemed to diminish the visibility of the nebula more than did the increase of power with which the wires were sufficiently seen

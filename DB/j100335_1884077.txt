j100335,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,1884077,The New York Building Trades,i332364,THE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES THE employers and workpeople in New York who have been familiar with the building trades during the past year universally agree that never in their experi ence have they met so tangled a situation A succession of strikes lockouts and criminal prosecutions of walking delegates growing out of trade jurisdiction rival organiza tions union misrule and ending finally in the organization of the employers and a reorganization of the industry with a joint arbitration board make this a significant and in teresting labor dispute of the year 1903 The storm centre of the disturbance was the United Board of Building Trades familiarly known as the  Board of Delegates When this board was created in March 1902 it was confidently expected that the former anarchy of jurisdictional strikes and dual unions would be reme died and the Board was organized under the advice and even the pressure of several influential contractors who had suffered from fights between the unions But the organization while it remedied in part the evils of dis union brought forth the new evil of  graft The first Board of Delegates in the building trades was started in 1884 by the walking delegates of the only four unions that had such officers at that time These dele gates met first in a spirit of fun and sociability and with out authority from their unions The board was extra constitutional It did not realize its possibilities The delegate was merely the business agent of the union se lected to carry its messages but without authority to change or enlarge his instructions But there was one circumstance in the building trades that served to give410 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS this extraconstitutional body unexpected but useful power This was the necessity of prompt action in deal ing with contractors The building industry in New York as well as elsewhere in the United States is con ducted unlike that in England and Europe on a system of subcontracting The mason builder or general con tractor secures the contract from the owner or client and generally puts up the brickwork but he sublets by competitive bidding all of the other work to as many contractors as there are kinds of work This system en ables the contractor to enter the field with little or no cap ital since it is usually arranged that partial payments shall be made by the owner to the general contractor and by him to the subcontractors as the work progresses A subcontractor may have but a few days woTk on a job and if he violates his agreement with the union or any of the rules the union is striving to enforce his work may be finished and his men discharged before the union can hold a meeting and call a strike Consequently in the building trades the unions have given their walking delegates authority to call a strike at the moment when they are satisfied a rule is violated This usually occurs when the delegate finds a nonunion man on the job since a nonunion man is not supposed to observe the rules or wagescale of the union The delegate then reports his action to the union meeting where he is generally sus tained as a matter of course But a strike of a single union on a job may not be ef fective and the delegate must bring the matter home if possible to the general contractor The other unions are working for other contractors and in order to hold the general contractor responsible the entire construc tion must be tied up The unions have provided for this in advance by a clause inserted when they make an agree ment which reads A sympathetic strike shall not beTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 411 a violation of this agreement With this in mind the delegate invites the other delegates whose men are on the job to meet him at the place and endeavors to satisfy them that his grievance is real and cannot be remedied unless they also pull their men Here is the occasion for the Board of Delegates They meet two or three times a week to advise one another of their grievances and to make appointments to meet on the jobs If the Board of Delegates is recognized anywhere in the union consti tution it is informally recognized in this provision for sympathetic strikes It is a significant fact that the only union of the building trades which does not permit the sympathetic strike is that of the bricklayers who are employed by the gen eral contractor while the unions employed by subcon tractors hold that the sympathetic strike is indispensa ble Naturally of course the bricklayers delegate has never been a member of the Board of Delegates To return to the origin of the United Board The sociable board of four delegates inaugurated in 1884 not realizing its possibilities felt its way only by gradual steps to joint action The unions when they acted in sympathy had done so hitherto through the Central Labor Union a representative assembly of all trades in the city meeting once a week But little by little the Board of Delegates took independent action and so prompt and satisfactory were the results that the unions quietly accepted their usurpations and other unions elected delegates who joined the Board In 1890 the Board had become entirely independent and dominant in the building trades But their supremacy did not long continue Internal factions and conflicts arosemainly on personal grounds and in 1894 the board divided For six years two hostile boards were in the field the Board of Delegates and the412 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Building Trades Council In some trades there were two unions claiming the same work one in the Board and the other in the Council In other trades the unions attempted to enlarge their jurisdiction to cover a different trade in the opposing board Each board acted as a unit employ ing the sympathetic strike against the other Employers who hired men from one board could not get men of other trades from the other board Building construction was continually interrupted not on account of lockouts low wages or even employment of nonunion men but on account of fights between the unions The friendly em ployer who hired only union men along with the unfriendly employer was used as a club to hit the opposing union And the friendly employer suffered more than the other No doubt the merging of the two boards in the United Board of Building Trades in March 1902 was welcomed by employers and workmen The board included all the strong unions except the bricklayers Delegates were admitted on credentials signed by the officers of the union and thus the board was officially recognized Its objects were to secure harmony and unity of action and to stop internal warfare It provided for arbitration of disputes between unions and a penalty of suspension for the union failing to obey a decision Some fifteen juris dictional disputes were thus decided during the life of the Board In but one case was a decision defied and this one defiance began the movement that wrecked the Board as will soon appear The United Board adopted simple and effective rules for sympathetic strikes A union might act independently but it forfeited the support of the board When a dele gate brought in his grievance it became the property of the board All of the delegates having men on the job said the rules shall be ordered to investigate the grievance and if deemed necessary shall have powerTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 413 to order a strike provided twothirds of the committee favor said strike Members of the committee were fined three dollars if thirty minutes late at the place appointed If they failed to agree the delegate had an appeal to the board where a majority decided and a final appeal to the president of the board whose decision was binding on him and the delegate refusing to strike in sympathy With the employers unorganized this sympathetic strike was irresistible Soon rumors of graft and holdup began to circulate One firm was said to have paid a delegate 2000 to have a strike  called off Nu merous statements were made of smaller amounts paid over It was declared that some of these payments went in whole or in part to members of the union as compensation for waiting time that is time lost while on strike Like the Germans in the war with France the unions compelled the conquered to pay the cost of the conquest This indemnity policy was praised as a peace measure and indeed such it was in a small way but the defective bookkeeping and accounting of the unions left opportunities for delegates to pocket unknown sums for themselves Probably the most amazing act of the board during its brief career was the holdup of the Association of Interior Decorators and Cabinetmakers and the sell out of the Amalgamated Painters The latter organ ization was a partner in the board at its origin and ob jected to the admission of the local branch of the Inter national Brotherhood of Painters which at that time had but a few hundred members The international organ ization struck against the employers on their work out side New York and thus won from them a contract to employ only Brotherhood men in New York The Amal gamated Painters had the support of the Board of Dele gates and the board called out the other trades where414 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Brotherhood men were employed But the ring in con trol of the board offered to seat the Brotherhood on pay ment of a large sum of money Not being able to get this from the union they demanded it from the employers who contributed 400 each to the fund The board then seated the Brotherhood and remained neutral in the fight between the two unions How extensive was this blackmail on employers or on each other is not publicly known but it seems to have centred in a ring headed by the leading spirit and organ izer of the board Sam Parks business agent of the Struct ural Iron Workers More serious than blackmail was the alleged partnership of Parks and the board with the larg est firm of builders the George A Fuller Company This company operates through the United States on a large scale and it had introduced a system of direct employ ment in place of the contract system of other builders By dispensing with subcontractors by doing all of its construction through its own  departments and thereby more easily keeping on friendly terms with the Board of Delegates it was able to complete a building in much less time than the other buildersan item of money value to its clients It is known that this company paid con siderable sums to delegates for services such as going to other localities to use their good offices In various ways it had the friendship and confidence of the delegates On the other hand mechanics preferred to work for it since its construction was on such a large scale that their employment was steadier and workmen in the building trades always spoke highly of its treatment of the men prompt payment of wages protection of life and limb and readiness to remedy grievances It is certainly true that the Fuller Company suffered little or nothing from strikes during the reign of the United Board while other builders were continually troubledTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 415 These things might have continued longer than they actually did had it not been for two weaknesses of the Boardsecession of the carpenters and accession of the teamdrivers One was a weakness of discipline the other a weakness of expansion They opened the way for em ployers to organize Between the local branch of the old English organiza tion known as the AmalgamatedSociety of Carpenters and Joiners and the American Brotherhood of Carpenters there was a longstanding feud The Amalgamated was a small but sturdy organization of seven hundred members the Brotherhood claimed ten thousand members Both went into the United Board in March 1902 The Brother hood had a contract with the Fuller Company to employ only Brotherhood men It demanded similar agreements with other builders and was extending its control at the expense of its diminutive rival It finally demanded the dissolution of the Amalgamated This the Board rejected The Brotherhood withdrew in July 1902 From that time until April 1903 the Board permitted Brotherhood carpenters although outside the Board to work with other unions and tried to remain neutral But the Brotherhood was aggressive On certain jobs it re fused to work if Amalgamated men were employed The Board stood by the Amalgamated and refused to work on those particular Jobs with the Brotherhood The Brotherhood decided to fight the Board The national officers took the matter up came on the ground with their treasury and without warning on April 7 ten thousand Brotherhood carpenters began an amazingly suicidal strike throughout the city They struck not only in the shops where Amalgamated men were employed but they struck in shops where they had contracts for the exclusive em ployment of their own members The motives and logic of this selfdestruction are explained on the ground that416 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS the Brotherhood throughout the country had grown so rapidly that its officers had lost their heads At any rate all buildings were tied up The Fuller Company by a quick stroke of generalship the day after its Brother hood men quit work secured nearly all of the Amalga mated men in town and was not seriously affected At this point a meeting was called by a committee of the Building Trades Club a semibusiness organization and the Building Trades Employers Association was started But the carpenters strike big as it was was soon eclipsed A small union of buildingmaterial drivers had been ad mitted to the Board of Delegates and the Board saw in that union a hope of controlling the entire building in dustry by the easy means first of shutting off the ma terial of any unfair contractor and next of union izing the lumber and material yards The drivers rep resented that they controlled the bulk of the teamsters in the lumber and material line and the Board indorsed their proposed demand that none but union teamsters be em ployed Here the Board overreached itself and its venture in the line of expansion brought it to an unknown conti nent where the employers were organized The Associa tion of Lumber Dealers and the Association of Brick and Material Handlers are close organizations of fifteen years successful operation controlling all of the yards and act ing together under a joint secretary In the year 1891 they had disastrously defeated a union of teamsters and they had maintained their organization intact from that time as an exchange a credit association a social club as well as an employers association The drivers now began by presenting their demands to one yard at a time and they had gone as far as five yards when suddenly without warning every yard in Manhattan shut its gates The secretary of the two associations notified the board through the daily press that the shutdown would continueTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 417 until the Board revoked its endorsement of the teamsters demand The carpenters strike laid off ten thousand men but the material mens shutdown laid off seventy thousand It continued four weeks and split the Board The board at this time contained thirtyseven unions of which twentytwo belonged to the skilled trades and fifteen to unskilled occupations the teamsters among the latter The Housesmiths led by Sam Parks went with the unskilled unions and took enough other trades to make a majority of one each union having a single vote The skilled trades forthwith seceded formed a new Board of Skilled Mechanics revoked the endorsement of the teamsters and the dealers immediately opened their yards But now it was the turn of the material dealers to be surprised They had deprived the builders of material and now the builders were ready to deprive them of a market Two years before there had been a vigorous effort to organize the builders and contractors Each trade for many years had had its separate organization but it had not been possible at that time to create a central body The conflicting interests were too great the plan of organ ization was crude and more than all the unions them selves were not yet centralized But the material dealers shutdown furnished the opportunity While it continued the builders completed their organization As soon as the shutdown was declared off they declared a lockout A week later they offered to the unions a plan of arbitration Unlike the former plan to organize the employers this association was builded on existing foundations There were in existence thirty associations of employers and contractors in the thirty different trades of the building industry While in the former attempt at organization each contractor joined the central association as an in dividual regardless of the trade association to which he owed allegiance in the present association the existing418 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS trade associations enter as units under a constitution binding each association while its individual mem bers are required to be also members of the general asso ciation The autonomy of the several associations is left untouched except at points of conflict or at points where united action is necessary in dealing with the unions In other words the Building Trades Employers Association is a federal government like the United States in which the individual is a member both of the general association and of his trade association the general association pos sessing such powers as are delegated to it and all other powers being reserved to the original trade associations But these delegated powers are broad for they include the power generally to determine regulate and control the conduct of the members of this association and the employers associations represented on the Board in all matters pertaining to their relation with their employees Any action dealing with prices or restricting competition is especially excluded Every member of a trade asso ciation becomes thereby a member of the general asso ciation There are also individual and associate members but these have no voice in the Board of Gov ernors A members dues are 40 which are paid for him by his trade association But he is personally required to give bond with a surety company ranging from 500 to 2500 to insure compliance with and obedience to the decisions orders prohibitions and regulations of the Board of Governors The amount of the bond is made payable on the mere formal notice of the Board of Gov ernors and is stipulated as liquidated damages and not as a penalty Latterly the association recommended to its members a form of contract containing a lockout clause exempting the contractor from damages where such lock out is ordered by the Building Trades Employers Associa tion The bonding provision of the constitution enforcedTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 419 by the additional clause that a member cannot resign during a temporary suspension of business is counted as the most essential and effective feature of the organi zation Taken with another clause of the constitution it amounts to compulsory membership in the associa tionthe parallel to the unions closed shop This other clause reads To promote and maintain harmony between the different trades it is recommended that the members of the Association shall place all orders for work requiring labor at the building in any trade represented on the Board of Governors with members of this Associ iation Since the Mason Builders Association has taken the lead in the movement this section of the constitution although a recommendation is practically a pledge on the part of the general contractors that they will sublet their work only to members of the association Thus have the employers found it necessary to bind themselves to each other after the manner of the unions with which they are dealing At the same time the practice of making exclusive agree ments within each trade seems in a fair way to be broken up by this larger association of all the employers in the industry The Stone Trade Association has not been admitted since it has an agreement by which members of the stonecutters union work only for members of the Employers Association the union treasury receiving a bonus of 10 per cent on all contracts This has led to a system of cooked bidding on contracts The arrange ment is already crumbling and two or three stone trade employers have broken away and have applied for ad mission to the Building Trades Employers Association as associate members Four associations of employers which have exclusive agreements yet without the ob noxious bonus or bidding features of the stone trade are represented in the Board of Governors These are the420 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS plumbers the steam and hot water fitters the marble and the tile associations The Board of Governors is made up of three representa tives for each trade association At the time of its in auguration twenty associations took part through their executive committees Soon thereafter thirty associa tions were represented on the Board of Governors The unit rule prevails but each delegate counts one vote for every five members Thus the three representatives of the mason builders with 108 members cast as a unit 21 votes out of a total of 160 votes A quorum to order a cessation or resumption of work by any or all of the members of the Association must include threefourths of the associations and the affirmative must cast four fifths of the votes The Board of Governors meets once a month or on twentyfour hours notice The associa tion meets semiannually or on request either of twenty five members or the Board of Governors There were three evils which the new association de termined to drive from the building industry namely sympathetic strikes jurisdictional strikes and the power of the walking delegate to call a strike The Board of Governors drafted a plan of arbitration designed to over come these evils Since the walking delegates were the objects of attack the plan was not submitted to the Board of Delegates but was addressed to the secretaries of the unions and to individual members The unions were requested to meet and act upon it The communication contained the following For the last few years the conditions in our industry have been steadily growing worse until they culminated in the present ces sation of work As you can see from our platform and plan of arbitration we have but one object in view namely to conduct our business relations in a fair honest and American way and we want you to help us No doubt our actions our motives andTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 421 our plans will be attacked by those representatives of labor who are unwilling to be deprived of any powers which have been given to them or have been assumed by them We refuse to believe that the rank and file of labor is acquainted with many of the acts of these representatives and of the conditions which exist in some of the trades but how grievous they were is proven by the present standstill and the fact that within three weeks nearly thirty employers associations of our industry have become a unit as a living protest against oppression and extortion We therefore call upon every conservative and thinking mechanic to attend the meeting of his union and register his vote against the un American methods that have crept into the trade and insist upon the plan of arbitration as suggested Unfortunately the communication to the unions did not contain an invitation to appoint representatives to confer upon amendments to the plan and since the em ployers declined to meet the walking delegates who had hitherto conducted such negotiations nearly all of the members looked on the plan as an ultimatum This in terpretation was afterwards disavowed by the Board of Governors At any rate with unimportant exceptions the unions ignored it and in many cases the secretaries did not even read it at the meetings explaining that it did not bear the union printers label The communica tion was sent only to the unions of skilled mechanics and helpers and not to the unions of laborers A deadlock ensued and continued for three weeks Meantime the New York Civic Federation addressed an invitation to the unions of mechanics and to the Board of Governors proposing a joint conference to discuss the employers plan of arbitration The Board of Governors accepted the invitation and the labor members of the Civic Federation went to the meetings of several unions to urge its acceptance The officers of three or four unions prevented them from getting a hearing but in every case where they were given the privilege of the floor422 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS the union voted to send a committee It was privately arranged with the walking delegates that they would not seek appointment on these committees and in the con ference that followed there was present but one such dele gate who took no part in the discussion and whose pres ence was not obj ected to The conference met with sixty members of the Board of Governors with fifteen unions officially represented and three unions represented unofficially It was called to order by the chairman of the conciliation committee of the Civic Federation rep resenting employers and a report on credentials was made by the secretary of the same committee representing trade unions After brief speeches counselling moderation these intermediaries withdrew and the conference pro ceeded to elect as its chairman the chairman of the Board of Governors and as secretary the president of the Tile Layers Union The conference began at two oclock on July 3 and held in continuous session until three oclock of the morning of July 4 Amendments were adopted and the amended plan was signed by all of the conferees An adjournment was taken until July 9 when three ex planatory clauses were added In this final form it was printed and submitted to all the unions Within three weeks twothirds of the unions signed and returned to work and within four weeks the General Arbitration Board was organized and adopted its rules of procedure With those unions which did not sign negotiations were conducted and in a few cases where these negotiations were unsuccessful scab unions were organized with which the members of the signatory unions worked on buildings without protest The arbitration plan as adopted is given in an appen dix to this article In its framework it is identical with that originally submitted by the employers but certain amendments were added at the conference It providesTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 423 that unions and employers in each trade shall decide all questions affecting alone their particular trade If they cannot decide and cannot agree on an umpire they must select an arbitration board outside the trade from the list of general arbitrators The General Arbitration Board is composed of two arbitrators elected by each employers association and two elected by each union the union ar bitrators not to be walking delegates No strike can be ordered by a union or a walking delegate and no lockout by an employer or an association before the matter in dispute is brought before the General Arbitration Board and settled This includes specifically jurisdictional dis putes and sympathetic strikes as well as appeals on mat ters which cannot be settled by the employers and unions within a trade The following items were added in the conferences with the unions Only members of the unions party to the agreement are to be employed and the em ployers association agrees to enforce this clause on all contractors If the union is unable to provide sufficient workmen any employer may bring the matter before the General Arbitration Board which has power to au thorize him to employ nonmembers Unskilled trades not being parties to the agreement are represented through mechanics of that trade The notable fact which the conferences developed was the willingness of the employers to add the items which the unions requested and the willingness of the unions to accept the framework which the employers proposed In fact the conferences resolved themselves mainly into explanations of misunderstandings So impressive is this fact that to an outsider it might seem that the lock out could have been avoided had the employers in the first place simply asked the unions to send representatives to a conference But it must be remembered that the conference excluded walking delegates who might have424 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS been less conciliatory since it was for the purpose of clip ping their powers that the conference assembled and moreover the walking delegates could doubtless have prevented the unions from electing as representatives any but themselves had not two or three weeks of idleness compelled them to realize the strength of the new organ ization of employers However this may be at the very beginning of the first conference the union representatives proposed that all lockouts and strikes be declared off that work be resumed and that thereupon the plan of arbitration be taken up Several unions stated that the lockout was a violation of existing agreements with their employers and this was peculiarly true of the bricklayers whose arbitration agree ment with the mason builders had not once been violated in eighteen years Now they were locked out through no fault of their own in order to compel them to accept an additional agreement which had not been offered to them in the regular course The bricklayers indeed on this account refused to send representatives to the confer ence Several other unions filed the same grievance and this violation of existing agreements was the argu ment of greatest force played upon by those who were able afterwards to prevent various unions from accept ing the amended plan satisfactory as it was in all essen tial points The conference however proceeded on the request of the chairman who said Let us see what we can do with the document first and then we will find out what our future action is to be For the evil of jurisdictional strikes the most disastrous and perverse of all the unions were as eager to find a remedy as the employers The only objection offered to this feature of the employers plan was the probabil ity that a local arbitrament would decide contrary to the national policy of the two unions concerned and it wasTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 425 argued that the matter should therefore be left to the local unions and referred by them to the national organizations without any trouble to the employers themselves But it was readily answered that the unions neither local nor national had been able to settle their disputes and furthermore the employers of conflicting unions were as much interested as the unions themselves in widening their jurisdiction This clause was left undisturbed It would seem that the most radical amendment made to the employers plan was that requiring the exclusive employment of union men Yet the employers explained that all of the existing agreements were already exclu sive and were to continue in force and that the proposed plan was not a substitute for those agreements but an addition to them intended only to remedy the two evils of sympathetic and jurisdictional strikes The chair man brought out strongly this position of the employers in answering a question whether a union would have a right to strike if a member of the Employers Association should sublet a part of his work to a nonunion contrac tor He replied If any nonunion men are on a building in connection with union men and our employees come to any member of the Employers Assocation and notify them at once we will notify that contrac tor owner or whoever he is that unless he removes those men from that building at once we will order our trades withdrawn Is that plain enough gentlemen The only point is this gentle men that we expect to work together hereafter for each others interests This is distinctly an arrangement between your asso ciation and ours The only thing is that we shall not be willing to interrupt work and have every one do as he likes We will have a regular arrangement for handling those cases and you will get your redress perhaps quite as quickly and with less loss to yourself Since the unions however wished the new agreement to be explicit on this point the matter was taken up and426 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS discussed at great length It developed that while ex isting agreements were exclusive yet a few of them con tained a provision that in busy seasons when the union could not furnish men the employers might take on non union men on probation cards or otherwise who were to be discharged as soon as union men appeared unless the union chose to take them in To care for these ex ceptional cases a union spokesman proposed that the employment of nonunion men in emergencies should be referred to the General Arbitration Board and this was adopted at the second conference It will be seen from the above quoted reply of the chair man and from the arbitration plan that the employers had in mind from the beginning not only the employ ment exclusively of union men but a more effective and less expensive enforcement of that rule than any that the walking delegate with the sympathetic strike could con trive This alone has taken from the delegate the bulk of his duties since under the rules of procedure the sec retary of the Arbitration Board as soon as a complaint is lodged notifies the contractor to remove the nonunion man In order to facilitate this procedure one of the early acts of the Board of Governors after the arbitration plan went into effect was to notify the unions that they should not decline to work with nonunion men on a job until twentyfour hours after filing notice with the Gen eral Secretary The employers reasoned that contractors who employ nonunion men are not members of the asso ciationin fact there has been but one case where a member employed a nonunionistand the plan is not designed to protect nonmembers If the unionist were required to work with the nonunionist then the outside contractors with nonunion labor could underbid the members who employ union labor at higher wages and soon members would drop out of the association beingTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 427 protected just as much outside and getting their labor cheaper Consequently to let the unions within twenty four hours enforce the union clause of the plan is to pro tect themselves in paying union wages There have been three or four strikes under these conditions and they were promptly settled The outside contractors being thus placed at a disadvantage in dealing with the unions forth with apply for membership and in this way the unions themselves are strengthening the Employers Association The clause affecting unskilled labor is one where the employers seem to have departed more than elsewhere from their original program They had included the helpers unions such as those of the tilelayers and steam fitters in their arbitration plan since these were unions of apprentices but they had not included the laborers It will be remembered that the skilled mechanics had seceded from the Board of Delegates They took the position that the majority of the troubles of the board had sprung from the unskilled unions But when the matter came up in conference the mechanics argued that the bricklayer the plasterer and so on were as much dependent as the employers upon their laborers that they could not disregard the claims of the laborers for protec tion in hours and wages and that if the mechanics bound themselves not to strike they should also be in a position to hold their laborers from striking The employers had taken the ground that wages and hours were not involved in the present dispute and when a union representative proposed that the wages paid to unskilled trades should not be reduced nor the hours increased and that the la borers should have representation through the mechanics this was agreed to The first case of arbitration under the perfected plan was that of the plasterers laborers and the Arbitration Board awarded them 325 a day The position of the walking delegate or business agent428 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS under the arbitration plan becomes similar to that in unions outside the building trades namely an executive officer and prosecuting witness of the union His legislative powers are taken away when his power to order a strike on his own judgment is taken away It becomes his business solely to look for violations of agreements The procedure under the rules of the Arbitration Board are undoubtedly slower than the summary procedure of the walking delegate for instead of calling out his men as soon as he sees a violation or as soon as he can assemble his fellowdelegates he must submit the complaint to the secretary of the union and the secretary must sub mit it in writing with seal attached to the secretary of the Arbitration Board known as the General Secretary and the latter must address a copy to the employer com plained of and a copy to the secretary of the association to which the employer belongs Then the union and the Employers Association become the parties to the com plaint and they must select each two arbitrators from the General Board not members of their own organiza tions and these must meet within twentyfour hours after notice is sent by the General Secretary Before this board the business agent appears as a witness Under this procedure decisions at first seemed painfully delayed and there was keen dissatisfaction among the unions But the dissatisfaction was such as is always found where constitutional law and courts supersede military law and trial by battle They are the defects of deliberation Their virtue is in the prevention rather than the cure of wrong The rules have been liberally interpreted so that at present the walking delegate makes the complaint directly to the General Secretary so as to avoid the delay of passing it through the hands of the union secretary It has also been found as predicted by the employers that petty grievances are disappearing The combined weightTHE NEW YORK BUILDING TRADES 429 of the entire Employers Association and all the unions is brought to bear upon an individual employer and a notice direct from the General Secretary usually brings a correction while the employers are careful in avoiding violations Of course the business agents retain all their prerogatives in dealing with contractors not members of the association and for this purpose they have organ ized a new board of delegates known now as the Board of Representatives of the Building Trades of New York and Vicinity This board is not recognized in the arbi tration plan nor by the employers of the association The General Arbitration Board composed of two rep resentatives of each union and each employers associa tion has had an interesting and peculiar development As originally conceived by the employers it was to be not really a board but a panel from which to select the arbitrators on any particular dispute It was to elect an executive committee of employers and employees in equal number and a general secretary and these were to select the special arbitration board whenever the par ties to a complaint failed to do so The powers of the General Board were to end with the election of the execu tive committee But gradually the board has become a joint conciliation body for the building industry en deavoring to settle disputes without resort to arbitration or arranging the terms upon which arbitration is At first when a meeting was called the union represen tatives held a caucus on the evening preceding and in the general meetings the two sides were inclined to line up solid But as matters proceeded and the earlier sus picions wore off the board has inclined to divide more according to individual judgment of the merits of the question and less on class lines It was stated above that several of the unions delayed signing the agreement and that work went on in their430 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS stead with other workmen The fortunes and mis fortunes of some of these unions make a vivid chapter in the history of the New York building industry So prolonged and spectacular was the fight of one of them under a daredevil leader and so widespread were the sensa tional accounts of its doings that to the outside world the entire industry seemed to be tied up These sensa tions undoubtedly made owners timid and retarded new enterprises and this timidity of capital was the card and the only card that this union had to play But many of the other unions and many seceders from this union returned quickly to work The Brotherhood of Carpenters after blunderingly starting the revolution and finding itself already starved when the real tumult began hurried to sign the employers agreement and thus by an unconditional surrender to the employers it won a victory over its rival for the Amal gamated Carpenters by delaying to sign were permanently disbarred A different outcome befell the rival unions in the pain ters trade The Amalgamated Painters signed promptly and hoped to bar their rival the Brotherhood which de layed a month But the Brotherhood had an exclusive contract with the Interior Decorators already referred to and was admitted The Amalgamated then demanded an arbitration on the ground that it was discriminated against by these employers This was the second case before the board The special board decided that the exclusive agreement with the Brotherhood was in force when the joint arbitration plan was signed and under Article 19 was to be respected But the board went further and ordered the Amalgamated Painters to join the Brother hood this being the national organization adding that when this should be done and the rivalry stopped wages should be advanced 50 cents a day to a minimum of 4THE NEW YORK BVUILDING TRADES 431 This latter remarkable decision was challenged by the Amalgamated and the General Board referred it to a judge of the Supreme Court who promptly declared that the board had exceeded its powers in ordering a union party to the agreement to extinguish itself The award of 50 cents of course fell with this decision and the two unions of nearly equal strength continue their rivalry within the board A jurisdictional dispute of ten years standing between the carpenters and the woodworkers was decided by an umpire and is enforced although the same dispute under charge of the two national organizations is as far from settlement as ever The same is true of another dispute which for fifteen years has been venerable with the critics of unions and has caused more inconvenience than any jurisdictional matter in the building line This is the contest between the bricklayers and electrical workers In their case the two employers associations joined with their respective unions as parties to the complaint The question was as to which union should cut the brickwork or fireproofing necessary for the installation of electric conduits The decision is recognized by competent par ties as not merely splitting the difference but a rea sonable division according to the nature and circumstances of the work The contest that centred about the Structural Iron Workers Union or rather a faction of that union was the one of most dramatic interest The leader of the union was its delegate Sam Parks who also organized the Board of Delegates and headed its corrupt clique Parks claimed the credit of having raised the ironworkers from an ill paid disorganized rabble at 250 a day to a powerful union of 4000 men at 4 a day But this credit belongs also to the conditions of the trade for wages elsewhere had risen in similar proportion This fact the union was432 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS beginning to recognize and a faction within the union dissatisfied with his bullying and dishonest methods had been able a year before to elect as president Robert Neidig a man exactly the opposite in every respect to Parks Neidigs faction at the semiannual election January 1903 had been able almost to defeat Parks for walking delegate and indeed he was barely elected at the foot of the list of four delegates two of whom were put in as Neidig men The narrow margin discredited him and the Neidig faction were confident just prior to the July election that they could defeat him But the employers unwittingly came to the help of Parks They furnished testimony to the district attorney on which he was ar rested for extortion He and his faction raised the cry of persecution He appealed to his union to vindicate him by their election boasting that the employers would then drop the prosecution and promising at once to resign His appeal was all the more taking because the particular charge on which he was arrested was a case where he had collected 2000  waiting time  for his men and the men had actually received the money or a part of it and had voted him a diamond ring in admiration of his services As a matter of fact this case was dropped by the district attorney and Parks when he was convicted three months later was sentenced on another charge of taking 250 at a different time and place He secured his vindica tion and was reelected but Neidig and his faction car ried all of the other offices but one Parks did not resign but made the most desperate fight of which his bullying methods were capable He drove Neidig from the chair and Neidigs faction from the hall and essayed even to capture the national convention and displace the national president who had meanwhile expelled his union He succeeded in having his union reinstated and failed by only three votes to put his man in the presidency HisTHE NEWV YORK BUILDING TRADES 433 union depleted its treasury in his defence before the court but he was convicted as were two confederates in other unions About this time the Fuller Company joined the Employers Association and paid a heavy fine The suc cess of the plan of arbitration was evident Thereupon a neutral element in the Iron Workers Union gained control It appointed a new strike committee with power to make a settlement with the Iron League the trade association of employers But the employers mean while had organized the Independent Housesmiths Union of New York with a State charter and had entered into an exclusive agreement with it The foremen with Neidig had held aloof from Parks and his faction though retain ing membership in the union and they undertook to teach the new mnen gathered in the new union This was pos sible because the structural ironworker is not strictly a skilled mechanic He is simply a riveter working in a gang on a skyscraper or a bridge The iron framework is constructed in the shop where the pieces are shaped and the holes are drilled ready for the rivets The re quirements for the trade are not so much mechanical skill as recklessness and daring The men say they do not die but are jerked over the river The strength of the union is the danger of the trade and the rivet that drops on the head of the nonunion man This accounts in part for the success of a man like Parks and makes all the more sur prising the success of a churchgoer like Neidig For three months after Parkss removal negotiations continued National officers of the union the executive committee of the American Federation of Labor committees of cen tral bodies took a hand but without result Work pro ceeded with the new union The employers did not wish to run the risk of another Parks and the new union stood on its agreement But a settlement to be permanent must be in harmony with the national organization of434 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS which the Parks union still held the local charter Fi nally Neidig was induced again to take hold He brought about the dissolution of both unions a reorganization into four locals chartered by the national organization to be governed by a representative district council a committee on membership with himself at the head to ex clude the vicious and criminal element acceptance of the employers plan and an agreement with the Iron League This closed the last breach and in January 1904 rounded out the new form of joint government in the New York Building Trades JOHN R COMMONS NEW YORK March 1904 APPENDIX ARBITRATION

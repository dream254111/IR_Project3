j100168,Harvard Law Review,1324404,Agency Agents Liability to Third Parties Theory of Undisclosed Principal Applied to Torts,i256962,RECENT CASES admits that the question is one of fact but declares that a written protest does not override the evidence of acceptance afforded by the cashing of the draft It seems doubtful therefore whether any evidence would have satisfied the court that the inference of acceptance had been rebutted If that be so the principal case shows a strong tendency to overthrow the rule that the question is the one of fact referred to above For a discussion of the principles involved see I7 HARV L REV 459 469473 ADMIRALTYTORTSDAMAGES RECOVERABLE FROM ONE OF TWO VES SELS AT FAULT In a collision at sea a vessel in tow was injured by the fault of the tug and a third vessel Held that the vessel in tow may recover her whole damage from the third vessel The Devonshire 27 T L R 490 P D This is clearly irreconcilable on principle with the English rule that an innocent cargo can recover only one half of its damage from one of two vessels injuring it The Drumlanrig igio P 249 If the court allows contribution on the facts of the principal case the result will be that where a vessel is injured the English rule as to joint tortfeasors will be the same as the Amer ican See 24 HARV L REV I50 But it seems hardly likely that the English court will allow contribution in a separate suit since it has refused to allow it where both tortfeasors are in court The Avon and Thomas Joliffe I891 P 7 ADVERSE POSSESSION SUBJECT MATTER AND EXTENT APPLICATION OF CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION DOCTRINE TO LARGE TRACTS OF LAND  The defendant having been for more than 25 years in actual possession of I5 to 20 acres of land under color of title to a 320acre tract the plaintiff brought an action of ejectment to recover the entire tract Held that the defendant has acquired title to the 320 acres Marietta Fertilizer Co v Blair 56 So I31 Ala By the American doctrine the occupation of part of a tract of land under color of title to the whole is constructive adverse possession of the entire tract Ellicott v Pearl Io Pet U S 412 The reason for this rule is that it is im practicable for the occupant to clear and cultivate an entire farm at one time See Jackson d Gilliland v Woodruf i Cow N Y 276 287 This reasoning is obviously inapplicable to a case where actual possession of a few acres is made the basis for a claim to a vast expanse of country Chandler v Spear 22 Vt 388 Accordingly several courts have held that the amount of land which can be thus obtained must be limited to a tract which can be used in one body according to the usual manner of business of the country Thompson v Burhans 61 N Y 52 See Murphy v Doyle 37 Minn II3 II6 33 N W 220 222 The difficulty of applying such a rule is perhaps increased as the principal case points out by the largescale methods of modern business but its necessity is clear Archibald v New York Central etc R Co I N Y App Div 25I 37 N Y Supp 336 The weight of authority however is perhaps in accord with the principal case Doed Lenoir v South io Ired N C 237 Hicks v Coleman 25 Cal 122 The question is regulated by statute in several states N Y CODE Civ PROC  370 CAL CODE CIV PROC I906  323 AGENCYAGENTS LIABILITY TO THIRD PARTIESTHEORY OF UNDIS CLOSED PRINCIPAL APPLIED TO TORTS  The defendant concealing the fact that he was merely an agent employed the plaintiff to work on a building The plaintiff did not know till after the injury complained of that the defend ant was an agent There was no evidence that the defendant was personally negligent Held that the defendant is liable as if he were the principal Yar slowitz v Bienenstock I30 N Y Supp 93I Sup Ct The agent of a disclosed principal is not liable for injuries to subagents unless he himself has been negligent Stone v Cartwright 6 T R 411 Brown 183HARVARD LAW REVIEW v Lent 20 Vt 529 But when the employing agent conceals his agency he is liable as if he were principal Malone v Morton 84 Mo 436 Morris  Co v Malone 200 Ill 132 65 N E 704 The principal case apparently suggests that this distinction is explained by the doctrine of undisclosed principal that an agent who contracts as principal is liable on the contract Simon v Motivos 3 Burr I92I Pierce v Johnson 34 Conn 274 The same rule holds where one contracts as agent but fails to name his principal Cobb v Knapp 7I N Y 348 Ye Seng Co v Corbitt 9 Fed 423 The reason usually given is that the agent is a party to the contract and in accord with this reason the agent is allowed to sue Joseph v Knox 3 Camp 320 Short v Spackman 2 B  Ad 962 But the principal may also sue on the contract Cothay v Fennell Io B  C 67I Huntington v Knox 7 Cush Mass 37I As there is a contract with but one person and on true principles of agency that con tract is made with the principal the reasoning of the cases holding the agent on the contract seems unsound Certainly it is inapplicable to the principal case where the liability is not contractual The decision should be placed on the short ground that the defendant having induced the plaintiff to enter the employment by holding himself out as principal is estopped to show that he Ms not the principal AGENCY  SCOPE OF AGENTS AUTHORITY BONA FIDE PURCHASER FROM PURCILHSER WITH NOTICE OF AGENTS FRAUD  An agent in violation of his instructions delivered a deed which had been executed with the name of the grantee blank The deed was recorded with the name of a party for grantee who was chargeable with notice of the agents wrong This grantee con veyed to a purchaser for value and without notice The principal joined all parties in a suit to quiet title Held that he is entitled to a decree provided he makes good the bond fide purchasers loss Guthrie v Field II6 Pac 217 Kan In Kansas parol authority to complete a deed executed with the grantees name blank is sufficient Exchange National Bank v Fleming 63 Kan I39 65 Pac 213 This is so even where a third party with the agents authority writes in the name Cf Commercial Bank v Norton I Hill N Y 50oi The agents incidental power to convey does not depend upon the third partys belief in its existence Edmunds v Bushell L R i Q B 97 Watteau v Fen wick i893 i Q B 346 The third partys knowledge of the agents wrong would make the transaction voidable as to him but would not prevent the passage of tite The bondfide purchasers title therefore should be unassailable Arnetts Committee v Owens 23 Ky L Rep I409 65 S W 15I Somes v Brewer 2 Pick Mass 183 The court relies upon the doctrine that of two innocent parties the loss must fall upon the one whose misplaced confidence enabled the wrongdoer to cause it As applied by the courts in cases like this it does not differ from estoppel Friswold v Haven 25 N Y 595 State v Matthews 44 Kan 596 25 Pac 36 From the nature of a deed it is difficult to find a represen tation to the purchaser from the grantee upon which to base an estoppel Cf Grant v Norway io C B 665 And if there is an estoppel the innocent purchaser should obtain a perfect title Horn v Cole 5I N H 287 Grissler v Powers 81 N Y 57 Contra Campbell v Nichols 33 N J L 8i In un usual cases relief upon the terms of the decree in the principal case might be granted Cf New York O New Haven R Co v Schuyler 34 N Y 30 If the third party completed the deed without authority from the agent title would not pass But the court does not accept this theory of the facts BANKRUPTCY  PROPERTY PASSING TO TRUSTEE  CORPORATE NAME  The trustee in bankruptcy of a corporation

Experiments on the solar and on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat with a comparative View of the Laws to zwhich Light and Heat or rather the Rays wbich occasion them are subject in order to determine whether they are the same or diferent By YWilliam Herschel LL D F R S PART II Read November 6 i8oo IN the first part of this Paper it has been shewn that heat derived immediately from the sun or from candent terrestrial substances is occasioned by rays emanating from them and that such heatmaking rays are subject to the laws of reflection and of refraction The similarity between light and heat in these points is so great that it did not appear necessary to notice some small difference between them relating to the refraction of rays to a certain focus which will be mentioned hereafter But the next three articles of this Paper will require that while we shew the similarity between light and heat we should at  For the First Part of this Paper see page 293 MDcGMc 3 L4I38 Dr IkRSCUELS Experimeizts on the solar and the same time point out some striking and substantial diffe rences which wvill occur in our experiments an the rays which occasion them and on which hereafter we may proceed to argue when the question reserved for the conclusion of this Paper whether light and heat be occasioned by the same or by different rays comes to be discussed ARTICLE ivDfferent Refrangibility of the Rays of Heat We might have included this article in the first part of this Paper as a corollary of the former three since rays that have been separated by the prism and have still remained subject to the laws of reflection1 and refraction as has been shewn could not be otherwise than of different refrangibility but we have something to say on this subject which will be found much more circumstantial and conclusive than what might have been drawn as a consequence from our former experiments However to begin with what has already been shewn we find that two degrees of heat were obtained from that part of the spectrum which contains the violet rays while the full red colour on the opposite side gave no less than seven degrees  and these facts ascertain the different refrangibility of the rays which occasion heat as clearly as that of light is ascertained by the dispersion and variety of the colours For whether the rays which occa sion heat be the same with those which occasion the colours which is a case that our foregoing experiments have not ascer tained the arguments for their different refrangibility rests on the same foundation namely their being dispersed by the prism and that of theirays of light being admitted the different  See ad and 4th experiments pages z58 and 259on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat refrangibility of the rays of heat follows of course So far then a great resemblance again takes place I must now point out a very material difference which is that the rays of heat are of a much more extensive refrangibility than those of light In order to make this appear I shall de lineate a spectrum of light by assuming a line of a certain length and dividing it into seven parts according to the di mensions assigned to the seven colours by Sir ISAAc NEWTON in the fourth figure of the second part of his Optics I shall represent the illuminating power of which each colour is pos sessed by an ordinate drawn to that line And here as the absolute length of the ordinates is arbitrary provided they be proportional to each other I shall assume the length of that which is to express the maximum equal to 3 of the whole line Trheus let GQ  represent the line that contains the arrange ment of the colours from the red to the violet Then erecting on the confines of the yellow and green the line LR  27 of GQ it will represent the power of illumination of the rays in that place For by experiments already delivered we have shewn that the maximum of illumination is in the brightest yellow or palest green rays  From the same experiments WG collect that the illuminations of yellow and green are equal to each other and not much inferior to the maximum this gives us the ordinates K and M Then by the rest of the same ex periments we obtain also the ordinates H I N 0 P with sufficient accuracy for the purpose here intended All these being applied to the middle of the spaces which belong to their respective colours we have the figure GRQG representing what may be called the spectrum of illumination See Plate XX t Se page Z6z 3L 944O  Dr HERSCILPS EXPeriments on the sotar and We are now in the same manner to find a figure to express the heating power of the refracted prismatic rays or what may be called the spectrum of heat In order to determine the length of our base I examined the extent of the invisible rays and found that at a distance of two inches beyond visible red my thermometer in a few minutes acquired 1  degree of heat The extent of the coloured spectrum at that time or the line which answers to GQ in my figure measured z97 inches If two inches had been the whole of the extent of the invisible part it might be stated to be in proportion to the visible one as 2 to q but we are to make some allowance for a small space required beyond the last ordinate that the curve of the heating power drawn through it may reach the base and indeed at 2m inches beyond visible red I could still find A degree of heat It appears therefore sufficiently safe to admit the base of the spec trum of heat AQ to be to that of the spectrum of light GQ as g to 3  or conforming to the NEWTONIAN figure before men tioned the base of which is 33 inches as 573 to 33 Now if we assume for the maximum of heat an ordinate of an equal length with that which was fixed upon for the maximum of light it will give us a method of comparing the two spectra together Accordingly I have drawn the several ordinates B C DI E F G H I KL M N O P of such lengths as from experiments made on purpose it appeared they should be in order to express the heat indicated by the thermometer when placed on the base at the several stations pointed out by the letters A mere inspection of the two figures which have been drawn as lying upon one another will enable us now to see how very differently the prism disperses the heatmaking rays and thoseon the terrestral Rays that occasion Heat 441 which occasion illumination over the areas ASQA and GRQG of our two spectra  These rays neither agree in their mean refrangibility nor in the situation of their maxima At R where we have most light there is but little heat and at S where we have most heat we find no light at all 21st Experiment The Sines of Refraction of the beatmaking Rays are in a constant Ratio to the Sines of Incidence I used a prism with a refracting angle of 6i degrees and placing the thermometer No I half an inch and No i one inch beyond the last visible red colour I kept No 2 by the side of the spectrum as a standard for temperature At j inch AtiL inch Standard No 4 No i No an e 64   64   6 67 a  66   63 2 5 6   67   63 8 69 671  63 Here in eight minutes the thermometer at half an inch from visible colour rose S degrees and at one inch from the same the other thermometer rose j while the temperature as ap pears by No 2 remained without change I now took a prism with an angle of fortyfive degrees and placing the thermometers as before I had as follows 55   55   55 59   57   54i 6i   58   62   58   55 Here we likewise had in o minutes a rise of 7 degrees in the Dr 1hRtLS ExpenentSn t he solar and therfmometer No 4 and df A in No X whie No t reined stationary I tried now all the three angles of a prism of whitish glass they were of 6 62 and 55 degrees and I found invisible rays of heat to accompany all the visible spectra given by these angles I tried a prism of crown glass having an angle of 3o degrees and found invisible heat rays as before I tried a prism of flint glass with so small an angle as 19 degrees and again found invisible heat rays I made a hollow prism by cementing together three slips of glass of an equal length but unequal breadth so as to give me different refracting angles they were of 510620 3o and 660 3o Then filling it with water and receiving the spoctrum when exposed to the sun as usual on the table I placed the thermometer No i at 4 inch behind the visible red colour and No A in the situation of the standard The refracting angle of the prism was 69 3o and in five minutes the thermometer received 1i degrees of heat from the invisible rays On trying the other angles I likewise found invisible heat rays in their usual situation beyond the red colour Now setting aside a minute inquiry into the degrees of heat occasioned by these invisible rays I shall here only consider them as an additional part annexed to the different quantities of heat which are found to go along with the visible spectrum in the same manner as if in the spectrum of light another colour had been added beyond the red Then as from the foregoing experiments it appears that a change of the refracting medium and of the angle by which the refractions were made occasioned no alteration in the relative situation of the additional part AGon the terrestral Rays that occasion Heat 43 with respect to GQ and as the part GQ is already known to follow the law ofrefraction we have mentioned it is equally evident that the additional heat of AG must follow the same law We do not enter into the dispersive power of different mediums with respect to heat since that would lead us farther than the present state of our iniegtigation could authorise us to go the following experiment however will shew that as with light so with heat such dispersive power must be admitted 22d Experiment Correction of the diferent Refrangibility of Heat by contrary Refraction in dfferent Mediums I took three prisms one of crown glass having an angle of 25 degrees another of flint glass with an angle of 24 and a third of crown glass with an angle of ito degrees These being put together as they are placed when experiments of achromatic refractions are to be made I found that they gave a spectrum nearly without colour The composition seemed to be rather a little over adjusted there being a very faint tinge of red on the most refracted side and of violet on the least refracted margin I examined both extremes by two thermometers keeping No 3 as a standard while No 2 was applied for the discovery of invisible rays but I found no heat on either side After this I placed No 2 in the middle of the colourless illu mination and in a little time it rose two degrees while No 3 still remained unaltered at some small distance from the spec trum This quantity was full as much as I could expect con sidering the heat that must have been intercepted by three prisms Thus then it appears that the different refrangibility of heat as well as that of light admits of prismatic correction And wemay add that this experiment also tends to the estab44j1 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and lishment of the contents of the preceding one for the refran gibility of heat rays could not be thus corrected were the sines of refraction not in a constant ratio to those of incidence e3d Experiment in Burningglasses the Focus of the Rays of Heat is diferent from the Focus of the Rays of Light I placed my burning lens with its aperture reduced to three inches in order to lessen the aberration arising from the sphe rical figure in the united rays of the sun and being now apprised of the different refrangibility of the rays of heat and knowing also that the least refrangible of them are the most efficacious I examined the focus of light by throwing hair powder with a puff into the air This pointed out the mean focus of the illuminating rays situated in that part of the pencil which opticians have shewn to be the smallest space into which they can be collected That this may be called the focus of light our experiments which have proved the maximum of illumi nation to be situated between the yellow and green and there fore among the mean refrangible rays of light have fully estabw lished The mean focus being thus pointed out by the reflection of light on the floating particles of powder I held a stick of sealing wax il6 or four beats of my chronometer in the con tracted pencil half an inch nearer to the lens than the focus In this time no impression was made upn the wax I applied it now half an inch farther from the lens than that focus and in 8tenths of a second or two beats of the same chronometer it was considerably scorched Exposing the sealing wax also to the focus of light the effect was equally strong in the same time from which we may safely conclude notwithstanding the little accuracy that can be expected for want of a more properon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 445 apparatus from so coarse an experiment that the focus of heat in this case was certainly farther removed from the lens than the focus of light and probably not less than  of an inch the heat at half an inch beyond the focus of light being still equal to that in the focus ARTICLE v Transmission of heatmaking Rays We enter now on the subject of the transmission of heat through diaphanous bodies Our experiments have hitherto been conducted by the prism the lens and the mirror these mnay indeed be looked upon as our principal tools and as such will stand foremost in all our operations but the scantiness of this stock cannot allow us to bring our work to perfection Nor is it merely the want of tools but rather the natural imperfection of those we have that hinders our rapid progress The prism which we use for separating the combined rays of the sun refracts reflects transmits and scatters them at the same time and the laws by which it acts in every one of these operations ought to be investigated Even the cause of the most obvious of its effects the separation of the colours of light is not well understood for in two prisms of different glass when the angles are such as to give the same mean refraction the dispersive power is known to differ Their transmissions have been still less ascertained and I need not add that the internal and external reflexions and the scattering of rays on every one of the surfaces are all of such a nature as must throw some obscurity on every result of experiments made with prisms A lens partakes of all the inconveniencies of the prism to which its own defects of spherical aberrations must MDCCC446 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on tide solar and be added And a mirror besides its natural incapacity of swpa rating the rays of light from the different sorts of heat scatters them very profusely But if we have been scantily provided with materials to act upon rays it has partly been our own fault every diaphanous body may become a new tool in the hands of a diligent inquirer My apparatus for transmitting the rays of the sun is of the following constructiona In a box 12 inches long and 8 inches broad are fixed two thermometers The sides of the box are 24 inches deep That part of the box where the balls of the thermometers are is covered by a board in which are two holes of A inch diameter one over each of the balls of the therm ometers  and the bottom of the box under the cover is cut away so as to leave these balls freely exposed There is a partition between the two thermometers in that part of the box which is covered to prevent the communication of secondary scatterings of heat Just under the opening of the transmitting holes on the outside of the cover is fixed a slip of wood on which may rest any glass or other object of which the trans mitting capacity is to be ascertained A thin wooden cover is providedt that it may be laid over the transmitting holes occa sionally to exclude the rays of the sun and on the middle of the slip of wood under the holes a pin is to be stuck perpen dicularly that its shadow may point out the situation of the box with respect to the sun The box thus prepared is to be fastened upon two short boards joined together by a pair of hinges A long slip of mahogany is screwed to the lowest of these boards and lies in the hollow part of a long spring fastened against the side of the upper one The pressure of the  Se Plate XXI FigI i See Fig zon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 447 spring must be sufficiently strong to keep the boards at any angle and the slip of mahogany long enough to permit an elevation of about 85 degrees In order to see whether all be properly adjusted expose the apparatus to the sun and lift up the board which carries the box till the directing pin throws the shadow of its head on the place where the point is fastened Then hold a sheet of paper under the box and if the thermometers have been properly placed the shadow of their balls will be in the centre of the rays passing through the transmitting holes to the paper A screen of a considerable size with a parallelogrammic opening should be placed at a good distance to keep the suns rays from every part of the apparatus except that which is under the cover and no more sun should be admitted into the room than what will be completely received on the screen inter posed between the window and the apparatus As one of the thermometers is to indicate a certain quantity of heat coming to it by the direct ray while the other is to shew how much of it is stopped by the glass laid over the trans mitting hole it becomes of the utmost consequence to have two thermometers of equal sensibility  The difficulty of getting  See Plate XXI Fig I t The theory of the sensibility of thermometers as far as it depends on the size of the balls may be considered thus Let D d S s T t be the diameters the points on which the sun acts and the points on which the temperature acts of a large and a small thermometer having spherical balls and let x y be the intensity of the action of the sun to the intensity of the action of the temperature on equal points of the surface of both thermometers Then we have s S d D  and t T 4d  DI The action of the sun therefore will be expressed by ds x Dr x and that of the tem peratu reby4d y 4D y and the united action of both byx4y x d1 x 4y x DI which are to each other as d1 D1 Now the total effect being as the squares of the 3M2448 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and such is much greater than can be imagined a perfect equality in the size and thickness of the balls is however the most essential circumstance When two are procured they should be tried in quick and in slow exposures These terms may be explained by referring to fire heat for here the thermometers may be exposed so as to acquire for instance 3o degrees of heat in a very short time which may then be called a quick exposure or they may be placed so as to make it require a good while to raise them so many degrees on which account the exposure may be called slow It is true that we have it not in our power to render the suns rays more or less efficacious and therefore cannot have a quick or slow exposure at our com mand but a great difference will be found in the heat of a rising or of a meridian sun not to mention a variety of other causes that influence the transmission of heat through the atmosphere Now when thermometers are tried in various exposures they should traverse their scales together with con stant equality otherwise no dependance can be placed on the results drawn from experiments made with them in cases where only a few minutes can be allowed for the action of the cause whose influence we are to investigate The balls must not be blacked for as we have already to encounter the transmitting capacity of the glass of which these balls are made it will not be safe to add to this the transmitting disposition of one or more coats of blacking which can never diameters while x  y remain in their incipient ratio and the contents of the thermo meters being as the cubes the sensible effect produced on the particles of mercury must be as d3 that is inversely as the diameters The small thermo meter therefore will set off with a sensibility greater than that of the large one in the same ratioon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 449 be brought to an equality and are always liable to change especially in very quick exposures Transmission of Solar Heat through colourless Substances 24th Experiment I laid a piece of clear transparent glass with a bluishwhite cast upon one of the holes of the transmitting machine the faces of this glass are parallel and highly polished Then put ting the cover over both holes I placed the machine in the situation where the experiment was to be made and let it remain there a sufficient time that the thermometers might assume a settled temperature For this purpose an assistant thermometer which should always remain in the nearest convenient place to the apparatus will be of use to point out the time when the experiment may be begun for this ought not to be done till the thermometers to be used agree with the standard In order not to lose time after an experiment the apparatus may be taken into a cool room or current of air till the thermometers it contains are rather lower than the standard after which being brought to the required situation they will soon be fit for action All these precautions having been taken I began the experi ment by first writing down the degrees of the thermometers then opening the cover at the time that a clock or watch shew ingseconds came to a full minute I continued to write down the state of the thermometers for not less than five minutes The result was as followso Dr LERSCUELS Experiments on the solar and No F Noio Sun B1uishwhite gOtas Of 67 67 I 68 68r 2 60 7 0 t 69 3 71 3 70 4 74 O8 5 73Q 71647 2 o 75 Here the sun communicated in S minutes 6 degrees of heat to the thermometer No A which was openly exposed to its action while in the same time No i received only 4 degrees by rays transmitted through the bluishwhite glass then as 6 4k2  X  750 This shews plainly that only Ad of the inci dent heat were transmitted and therefore that i of it was intercepted by the glass I shall here as well as in the following experiments point out the difference between heat and light in order as has been mentioned before to lead to an elucidation of our last discuss sion To effect this therefore I have ascertained with all the accuracy the subject will admit of the quantity of light trans mitted through such glasses as I have used but as it would here interrupt the order of our subject I have joined at the end of this Paper a table with a short account of the method that has been used in making it wherein the quantity of light transmitted is set down and to this table I shall now refer To render this comparative view more clear we may sups pose always 1ooo rays of heat to come from the object then 750 being transmitted it follows that the bluishwhite glass used in our experiment stops 25o of them and by the table aton the trestrial Rays that occasion Heat 451 the end of this Paper it stops 86 rays of light the number of them coming from the object also being put equal to 1ooo It should be remarked that when I compare the interception of solar heat with that of the light of a candle it must not be understood that I take terrestrial to be the same as solar light but not having at present an opportunity of providing a similar table for the latter I am obliged to use the former on a suppos sition that the quantity stopped by glasses may not be very different 2tb Experiment I took a piece of flint glass about 2I

the table before referred to we find that this glass stops 34 rays of light Before I proceed it will be necessary to adopt a method of reducing the detail of my experiments into a narrower com452 Dr HERSCHELs Experiments on the solar and pass It will be sufficient to say that they have all been made on the same plan as the two which have been given The observations were always continued for at least five minutes and by examining the ratios of the numbers given by the ther mometers in all that time it may be seen that setting aside little irregularities there is a greater stoppage at first than towards the end but as it would not be safe to take a shorter exposure than five minutes on account of the small quantity of heat transmitted by some glasses I have fixed upon that interval as sufficiently accurate for giving a true comparative view The experiments therefore may now stand abridged as follows 26th Experiment I took a piece of highly polished crown glass of a greenish colour and cutting it into several parts examined the transmit ting power of one of them reserving the other pieces for some other experiments that will be mentioned hereafter Sun Greenish crown glass 01 66z

one of the pieces of crown glass mentioned in the a6th experiment on fine emery laid on a plain brass tool to make the surface of it rough which it is well known will occasion the transmitted light to be scattered in all directions Supposing that it would have the same effect on heat I tried the transmitting capacity of the glass by exposing it with the rough side towards the sun over one of the

follows A box 22 inches long 5 broad and i4 deep has a hole in the centre i1 inch in diameter through which a wax candle thick enough entirely to fill it is to be put at the bot tom the box being properly elevated for the purpose There must be two lateral holes in the bottom 2 inches long and iL broad one on eachside of the candle to supply it with a cur rent of aUr as otherwise it will not give a steady flame whii ch is absolutely necessary At the distance of 1 I3 inch from the candle on each side are two screens 12 inches square with  See Plate XXIII Fig xOn the terrestrial Rays tiat QccasionI HTat a hole in each 4 inch in diameter through which the heat of the candle passes to the two thermometerg which are to be placed in opposite directions one on each side of the table Care must be taken to place them exactly at the same distance from the centre of the flame as otherwjse they will not receive equal quantities of heat The scales and their supports also must be so kept out of the way of heat coming from the candle that they may not scatter it back on the balls but suffer all that is not intercepted by them to pass freely forwards in the box and downwards through openings cut in the bottom B3efore the transmitting hales  between the two wooden screens must be two covers of the same material close to the openings  andl it will be necessary to join these covers at the side by a common handle that they may be removed together without disturbing any part of the apparatus when the experiment is to beginr The glasses are to be put before the therrmometer close to the transmnitting hole by placing them on a small Aviport below while the uppe part is held close to the screen by a light plummet suspnded by a thread which is fastened on one side and passes over the glass to a hook on the other side In making experiments many attentions are necessary such as keeping the candle exactly to a certain height that the brightest part of the flame may be just in the centre of the two transmitting holes that the wick may be always straight and not by bending approach nearer to one thermometer than to the other that the waxcup of the candle be kept clean and never suffered to run over c Before and now and then between the observations also the thermometers must be tried a few degrees that it may be seen a See Fig 2t 0 o464 Dr HERSCHELS experiments on the solar and whether they act equally and the candle during the time they cool down to the temperature must be put out by an extin guisher large enough to rest on the bottom of the box without touching any part of the wax Many other precautions I need not mention as they will soon be discovered by any one who may repeat such experiments 63d Experiment Candle Bluishwhite glass 0 59 59 5 623 6o5 I 6238

inches from each other and no more than 1ths in diametert On the face of the box are drawn two parallel lines also 3ths of an inch distant from each other and inclosing the transmitting holes they serve as a direction whereby to keep any required colour to fall equally on both holes The distance at which the box is to be X See Plate XX1 t See Plate XXII Fig 3on the terrestrial Rays that

rays of the same sort of heat Transmissionof FireHeat throigh various Substances When the same fire is to give an equal heat to two thermo meters at some short distance from each other it becomes highly necessary that there should be a place of considerable dimensions in its centre where it may burn with an eqpal glow and without flame or smoke To obtain this I used a grate Ad inches broad and 8 high having only three bars which Zdivide the fire into three large openings In the centre of the middle one of these when the grate is well filled with large coals or coke e may with proper management keep up the required equality of radiance The apparatus I have used is of the following construction A screen of wood S feet 6 inches high and 3 feet broad lined towards the fire with plates of iron has two holes 3 of an inch in diameter and at the distance of 2j inches from each other one on each side of the middle of the screen and of a height that will answer to the centre of the fire 2 j inches under the centre of the holes is a shelf about 22 inches long and 4 broad on which are placed two thermometers in opposite direc tions fixed on proper stands to bring the balls quite disen gaged from the scales directly 2 inches behind the transmitting  See Plate XXIVon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 477 holes A small thin wooden partition is run up between the thermometers to prevent the heat transmitted through one hole from coming to the thermometer belonging to the other The screen is fixed upon a light frame which fits exactly into the opening of the front of the marble chimneypiece and the ends of the frame are of a length which when the screen is placed before the fire will just bring the transmitting holes to be 6 inches from the front bars of the grate A large wooden cover also plated with iron shuts up the transmitting holes on the side next to the fire but may be drawn up by a string on the outside so as to open them when required Two assistant thermometers are placed on proper stands to bring their balls to the same distance from the screen as those which receive the heat of the fire but removed sideways as far as necessary to put them out of the reach of any rays that pass obliquely through the transmitting holes They are to indicate any change of temperature that may take place during the time of the experiment for notwithstanding the largeness of the screen some heat will find its way round and over it and this acting as a general cause its effect must be allowed for Xl7th Experiment Having tried the apparatus sufficiently to find that the ther mometers exposed to the transmitting holes would generally receive 2o or more degrees of heat without differing more than sometimes  or at most 4 of a degree I now placed the bluish white glass of the 24th experiment upon a support prepared for the purpose so as closely to cover one of the transmitting holes A small spring moveable on its centre is always turned

experiment which consists as we may see by the above register of it in the apparently regular continuance of its power of transmitting heat while its capacity of transmitting light was totally destroyed For when I placed this piece of talc over the hole in the screen it was extremely transparent as this substance is generally known to be and yet when the experiment was over it ape peared of a beautiful white colour and its power of transmitting light was so totally destroyed that even the sun in the meridian could not be perceived through it Now had the power of trans mitting heat through this substance been really uniform during all the five minutes it would have been quitea new phaenome non as all my experiment are attended with ai regular increase 3Q 2480 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and of it but since by calcination the talc lost much of its trans mitting power we may easily account for this unexpected regularity 123d Experiment Fire Very dark red glass

interesting of all the articles we have to investigate Dark heat is with us the most common of all and its passage from one body into another is what it highly concerns us to trace out The slightest change of temperature denotes the motion of invisible heat and if we could be fully informed about the method of its trans mission much light would be thrown on what now still remains a mysterious subject It must be remembered that in the fol lowing experiments I only mean to point out the transmission of such dark heat as I have before proved to consist of rays without inquiring whether there be any other than such existing My apparatus for these experiments is as follows  A box 12 inches long 52 broad and  deep has a partition through out its whole length which divides it into two parts At one end of each division is a hole 3 inch in diameter and each di vision contains a thermometer with its ball exposed to the hole and at one inch distance from the outside of the box Four inches of the box next to the holes are covered the rest is open In the front of it is a narrow slip of wood on which may rest any glass to be tried  and it is held close to the wood at the top by a small spring applied against it Two screws are planted upon the front one on each side which may be  See Plate XXV Fig Ion the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 4g91 drawn out or screwed in by way of accurately adjusting the distance of the thermometer from the line of action In order to procure invisible terrestrial heat I have tried many different ways but a stove is the most commodius of them Iron is a substance that transmits invisible heat very readily while at the same time it will most effectually inter cept every visible ray of the fire by which it is heated provided that be not carried to any great excess I therefore made use of an iron stove having four flat sides and being constructed so as to exclude all appearance of light I had it placed close to a wall that the pipe which conveys away smoke might not scatter heat into the room The thermometer box when experiments are to be made is to be put into an arrangement of twelve bricks placed on a stand with casters t these bricks when the stand is rolled close to the stove which must not be done till an experiment is to begin form an inclosure just fitting round the sides bot tom and covered part of the top of the thermometer box and completely guard it against the heat of the stove The box is then shoved into the brick opening close to the iron side of the stove where the two front screws coming into contact with the iron plate give the thermometers their proper distance which in the following experiments has been such as to bring the most advanced part of the balls to one inch and fourtenths from the hot iron It will be necessary to remark that on calculating the trans missions for the fifth minute I found that it would not be doing justice to the stopping power of the glasses to take so long a time for notwithstanding the use of brickwork and the  See Plate XXV Fig a f See Fig 0492 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and precaution I had taken of having two sets of it that one might be cooling while the other was employed and though neither of them was ever very hot yet I found that so much heat came to the box that when it was taken out of the bricks in order to be cooled the thermometers continued still to rise at an aver rage about two degrees higher than they were I have therefore now taken the third minute as a much safer way to come at the truth 170th Experiment Stove Bluishwhite

of our inquiry which from its novelty would deserve a fuller investigation than we can at present enter into The scattering of heat is a reflection of it on the rough surfaces of bodies it is therefore a principle of general influence since all bodies even the most polished are sufficiently rough to scatter heat in all directions In order there fore to compare the effect of rough surfaces on heat with their effect on light I have made a number of experiments from which the following are selected for the purpose of our intended comparative view The apparatus I have used for scattering solar heat is like that which served for transmissions but here the holes through which the suns rays entert are very exactly il inch in diameter each and are chamferred away on the under side  See Plate XXI Fig I See Plate XXIJ Fig 4498 Vr UERSCHEILS Expiments X tbl solar and that no re Iscattering may take place in the thickness of the covering board the distance of the centre of the holes is 4 inches A little more than an inch below and under the centre of the holes are the balls of the small thermometers A and B well shaded from the direct rays of the sun by small slips of wood of the shape of the ball and of that part of the stem which is exposed Under each thermometer is a small tablet on which the obs jects intended for scattering the suns rays are to be placed The tablets are contrived so as to bring the objects perpendui cularly under the opeenings and undier the centre of the balls of the thermometers at the distance of exactly one inch from them Every thing being thus alike on both sides of the box it is evident from the equality of the holes that an equal num ber of solar rays will fall on each object and will by them be scattered back on the thermometers at equal angles and equal distances The first five experiments that follow were made with an apparatus somewhat different from the one here described and though the result of them may not be so accurate as if they had been made with the present one I must give them as they are since time will not allow of a repetition i95tb Experiment Suns Message card scatterings 64 64 5 693 663 Here an object of a white colour 6 inches long and 6 broad scattered in 5 minutes 413 rays of heat back upon one  See Plate XXII Fig on the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 499 thermometer while the other received a thousand directly from the sun Now in order the better to compare the proportion of light and heat scattered by different objects we shall put these 413 rays equalto 1ooo or which is nearly the same multiply them by 2421 Then since the message card also scatters 100o rays of light as will be found in a table at the end of the transmission table our present object may be made a standard for a comparison with the four following ones 196th Experiment Sun Pinkcoloured paper scattering 64 64 5 70 661 6 2 438 Here a piece of pinkcoloured paper of the same dimensions with the card of the last

heat and 420 of light From these experiments it seems to be evident that in scat tering heat the colour of the object is out of the question  or at least that it is no otherwise concerned than as far as it may influence the texture of the surface of bodies For here we find that palegreen which is brighter or scatters more light than darkgreen yet scatters less heat Even black so generally known to scatter but little light scatters much heat But in order to put this surmise to a fairer trial I made the following experiments with my new machine 200tb Experiment I covered one of the tablets with white paper and the other with black The quantity of sunshine admitted through the two openings of 1 2 inch in diameter each being equal I found the heat scattered on both thermometers to be as

scatters no more than 578 rays of heat but 124371 of light ART vIWhether Light and Heat be occasioned by the same or by diferent Rays Before we enter into a discussion of this question it appears to me that we are authorised by the experiments wvhih have been delivered in this Paper to make certain conclusions that will entirely alter the form of our inquiry Thus from the 18th experiment it appears that  1 degrees of solar heat were given in one minute to a thermometer by rays which had no power of illuminating objects and which could not be rendered visible notwithstanding they were brought together in the focus of a burninig lens The same has also been proved of terrestrial heat in the 9th experiment where in one minute 3 degrees of it were given to a thermometer by rays totally invisible even when condensed by a concave mirror Hence it is establishedon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 507 by incontrovertible facts that there are rays of heat both solar and terrestrial not endowed with a power of rendering objects visible It has also been proved by the whole tenour of our prismatic experiments that this invisible heat is continued from the be ginning of the least refrangible rays towards the most refran gible ones in a series of uninterrupted gradation from a gentle beginning to a certain maximum and that it afterwards declines as uniformly to a vanishing state These phenomena have been ascertained by an instrument which figuratively speaking we may call blind and which therefore could give us no infor mation about light yet by its faithful report the thermometer which is the instrument alluded to can leave no doubt about the existence of the different degrees of heat in the prismatic spectrum This consideration as has been observed must alter the form of our proposed inquiry for the question being thus at least partly decided since it is ascertained that we have rays of heat which give no light it can only become a subject of inquiry whether some of these heatmaking rays may not have a power of rendering objects visible superadded to their now already established power of heating bodies This being the case it is evident that the onus probandi ought to lie with those who are willing to establish such an hypo thesis for it does not appear that nature is in the habit of using one and the same mechanism xvith any two of our senses witness the vibrations of air that make sound the effluvia that occasion smells  the particles that produce taste the resistance or repulsive powuers that affect the touch all these are eva dently suited to their respective organs of sense Are we thenSo8 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and here on the contrary to suppose that the same mechanism should be the cause of such different sensations as the delicate perceptions of vision and the very grossest of all affections which are common to the coarsest parts of our bodies when exposed to heat  But let us see what light may now be obtained from the several articles that have been discussed in this Paper It has been shewn that the effect of heat and of illumination may be represented by the two united spectra which we have given Now when these are compared it appears that those who would have the rays of heat also to do the office of light must be obliged to maintain the following arbitrary and revolting positions namely that a set of rays conveying heat should all at once in a certain part of the spectrum begin to give a small degree of light that this newly acquired power of illu mination should increase while the power of heating is on the decline that when the illuminating principle is come to a maximum it should in its turn also decline very rapidly and vanish at the same time with the power of heating How can effects that are so opposite be ascribed to the same cause  first of all heat without light next to this decreasing heat but increasing light then again decreasing heat and decreasing light What modification can we suppose to be superadded to the heatmaking power that will produce such inconsistent results  We must not omit to mention another difference between light and heat which may be gathered from the same article of the refrangibility of heatmaking rays It is that though light and heat are both refrangible the ratio of the sines of S See pane 439 and Plate XXon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 509 incidence and refraction of the mean rays is not the same in both Heat is evidently less refrangible than light whether we take a mean refrangible ray of each or which I believe to be the better way of proceeding whether we take the maximum of heat and light separately This appears not only from the view we have taken of the two spectra already mentioned but more evidently from the 20d experiment by which we find that heat cannot be collected by a lens to the same focus where light is gathered together Our fifth article in which an account has been given of the proportions of heat and light stopped by glasses and other sub stances will afford us now an ample field for pointing out a striking difference between these two principles From the 24th to the 3oth experiment we have the quantities intercepted by colourless substances as follows TABLE I Bluishwhite glass stops 250 rays of heat and 86 of light White flint glass   91    34   Greenish crown

kind of regularity takes place among the proportions of rays of one sort and of another which are stopped in their passage Heat and light seem to be entirely unconnected The bluishwhite and flint glasses for instance stop nearly three times as much heat as light whereas the MDCCC of U510 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on tbe solar and greenish crown glass stops only about onefourth more of the former than of the latter but as coloured glasses take in a much greater range I will now also give a tabular result of the experiments that have been given relating to them TABLE II Very dark red

intercepts 8oI of light and a dark red glass stops no more than 6o6 rays of heat and yet intercepts nearly all the light scarcely one ray out of hooo being able to make its way through it Before I proceed to a more critical examination of these results it will be necessary to add also a table of the same kind collected from the experiments with liquidson the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat

that we may if possible find a criterion by which to judge whether heat and light can be occasioned512 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and by the same rays or not Now this I think will be obtained if we can make it appear that stopping one sort of rays does not necessarily bring on a stoppage of the other sort for if it can be shewn that heat and light are in this respect independent of each other it will follow that they must be occasioned by diffe rent rays and I shall make all possible objections to the ar guments I mean to draw from these tables in order to shew that no hypothesis will evade the force of our conclusions It has been noticed that bluishwhite and flint glasses stop nearly three times as much heat as light whereas crown glass stops only about onefourth more of the former than of the latter Now in answer to this it may be alleged I that the ingredients of which the former glasses are made dispose them probably to stop the invisible rays of heat and that consequently a great interception of it may take place with out bringing on a necessity of stopping much light and that on the other hand the different texture of crown glass may stop one sort of heat as well as the other so that nearly an equality in this respect may be produced When a hypothesis is made in order to explain any pheenolO menon of nature we ought to examine how it will agree with other facts  and in this case we are already furnished with ex periments which are decidedly against the supposition that has been brought forward For the 148th and i49th experiments shew that the bluishwhite and flint glasses transmit all or nearly all the invisible rays of solar heat whereas crown glass by the i5oth experiment stops a considerable number of them But to assist the objecting argument let it be alleged as has been proved by the 9ath experiment that our bluishwhite glass stops a considerable portion of the heat that goes with theon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 13 red rays then if the 86 rays of light which this glass stops are supposed to be all of that sort the heat which will be stopped in consequence will according to the experiment we have mentioned amount to 86 multiplied by 7 that is 32 rays of heat but since 20have been stopped there will remain 218 to be accounted for In this calculation a manifest concession has been made which ought to be explained When I mention 86 redcoloured or redmaking rays I mean so many of them as will make up 86thousandths of the whole effect of light for the quantity of heat and light transmitted or stopped in all the experiments that have been given has been reduced to what proportion it bears to unity and having afterwards represented the joint effect of every ray of heat and light by iooo each mean ray of heat must be the thousandth part of that effect but a mean ray of light although it be likewise the thousandth part of the whole effect of light will not be so of heat because the whole effect of the latter is partly owing to rays that have been proved to be invisible On this account the 86 mniean rays of red light stopped by our bluishwhite glass cannot even amount to a stoppage of 32 rays of heat which we have allowed As I have made the concession on one hand I must explain an advantage that may be claimed on the other which is that mean rays and promiscuous ones have already in a former Paper been proved to differ considerably and that it remains therefore unknown how many redmaking rays we may sup pose to be stopped in order to make up 86 mean rays of light In answer to this however I must observe that the number of promiscuous rays of light and of heat must always be inversely as their power of occasioning those sensations so that if for514 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and instance a red ray is supposed to be twice as heating as a green one there will only go half the number of them to make up a certain effect of heat and on the other hand if a green ray should have a double power of illuminating there will be no more than half the number of them necessary to occasion a certain effect of light But by my former experiments a red ray though much inferior to a green one is probably fully equal in illumination to a mean ray of all the colours united together Now as red rays have also been proved to be accompanied by the greatest heat and as our bluishwhite glass stops hardly any invisible heat rays we have certainly gone the full length of fair concessions by allowing all the light stopped by this glass to be of that sort and thus it seems to be evident that the heat which lies under the colours if I may use this expres sion may be stopped without stopping the colours themselves It will not be necessary to lay much stress on this single experiment our second table affords us sufficient ground on which to rest more forcible arguments A darkred glass for instance was found to stop 606 rays of heat and 9998 of light This even at the very first view seems to amount to a total separation of the two principles but let us discuss the phaeno menon with precision As only one ray in 5ooo can make its way through this glass it is evident that if the rays of light be also those of heat there can hardly come any heat through it but what must be occasioned by rays that are invisible It will therefore become a question to be examined how many of this sort we can ad mit if we proceed on a supposition that heat consists of light as far as that will go Now this wie find has already been  See page 27o moth experimenton the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat ascertained in a great measure by our 13th i 7th and 18th experiments In the igth one hundred and twenty degrees of heat were given to a thermometer in one minute by the rays which accompany the coloured part ofthe spectrum In the 17th experiment on the contrary we find only 45 degrees of heat communicated to the same thermometer in the same time by the invisible rays of the same spectrum If we would be more scrupulous the i8th experiment limits the heat from rays totally invisible even to 21 degrees but in order to make every possible allowance let the proportion be the most favour able one of 120 to 45 which reduced to mean rays of heat will give 727 of them visible and 273 invisible to make up our thousand To return to the experiment if the total number of rays of heat ascribed to light should accordingly be rated at 727 it is evident from the stoppage of light of this glass that 726 rays of heat at least must also be intercepted and in consequence of the 1i3d experiment which shews that our glass opposes no obstruction to any of the invisible rays we shall require no more But by our present experiment this glass stops only 606 rays of heat so that 120 of them will remain unaccounted for Now the moment we give up the hypothesis that heat is occa sioned by the rays of light the difficulty becomes fully resolved by our looth experiment which shews that full threetenths of the rays that have the refrangibility of the red are actually transmitted In order however to make a second attempt to overcome this difficulty without giving up the hypothesis it may be supposed that perhaps the lens which has been used in the i3th 17th and i8th experiments might stop a greater number of invisible516 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and than visible rays ahd that its report therefore ought not to be depended upon Now although it does not appear from the 148th experiment that such a supposition can have much foun dation yet since those experiments were not made with a view to ascertain the proportion of heat contained in each part of the prismatic spectrum we cannot lay so much stress upon them as the accuracy which is required in this case renders necessary Let it therefore contrary to our looth experiment be admitted in order to explain the phamomenon of the red glass which stops so much light and so little heat that all the heat which it intercepts consists entirely of the rays which are visible and that every one of the invisible rays of heat is transmitted Then will 9998 intercepted rays of light be equal to 6o6 rays of heat and the remaining 94 will be the number of rays we are now to place to the account of the invisible heat which is transmitted Having thus also got rid of this difficulty we are next to examine how other facts collected in the same table will agree with our new concession A violetcoloured glass for instance stops 955 rays of light these at the rate of 9998 or say 1ooo to 606 must occasion a deficiency of 579 rays of heat But by our table this glass stops only 489 of them and there will thus be 9o rays of heat left unaccounted for To enhance the difficulty this glass by our 164th experiment stops also 4 of the supposed 394 invisible rays which will amount to an additional sum of 98 And our 1Mth experiment shews that actually a great number of these rays that otherwise cannot be accounted for come from the store of heat the rays of which are of the refrangibility of red light A darkblue glass stops 801 rays of light these if light andon the terrestrial flays that occasion Heat x7 heat were occasioned by the same rays would produce a stop page of 485 rays of heat but we find that our glass stops no more than 62 so that i rays cannot be accounted for by this hypothesis To this we should add 66 invisible rays that is 39 x i67 which according to our i6oth experiment this glass also intercepts But the 107th experiment if we reject the hypothesis immediately explains the difficulty for here we plainly see that only 71 rays of heat of the refrangibility of red light are stopped whatever may be the stoppage of that light itself A yellow glass stops 81  rays of light these will occasion a stoppage of 496 rays of heat but this glass intercepts only 333 and therefore 163 rays of heat must also remain unac counted for And turning to the 155th experiment we find that 79 rays or j of the 394 allowed to be invisible ones are also to be added to that number If in the results of our second table we have had an excess of heat which the last hypothesis would not account for we shall on the contrary meet with a considerable deficiency when we come to consider those of the third table For instance our tube filled with wellwater including the glasses at the end intercepted 1 1 rays of light These at the rate of 6oG to the thousand would produce only a stoppage of 12S rays of heat but here we find no less than 558 of them intercepted To evade the pressure of these consequences it may be said that as before every invisible ray was supposed to have been transmitted through glasses so they may now be all intercepted by liquids And granting this also to be possible though by no means probable for the great extent of these researches has not allowed sufficient time for many experiments MDCCC 3 XS18 Dr HERSCHELS xperiments on the solar and to be made that have been planned for execution yet even then 128 visible and 394 invisible rays to be intercepted will only make up 2  so that a deficiency of 36 must still remain In seawater the balance will stand thus 288 rays of light give 175 rays of heat these and 394 invisible rays maie up G9S buat the rays actually intercepted were 682 which argues a deficiency of no less than i ij rays But if 1 have for a noment admitted the entire stoppage of theinvisible rays of heat in liquids the same indulgence can not be granted for the empty tube as we know it does neither take place in glasses nor in air Therefoic we must calculate thus this compound of glass and air stops 2o4 rays of light these can amount only to 12 rays of heat but it is found to stop 542 of them so that 418 remain to be accounted for Now we certainly can not suppose more than ioo of them to owe their deficiency to the store of invisible heat so that 318 will still remain unaccounted for  And thus from the second table wAe have given instances where the assumed hypothesis of visible and invisible heat inr certain proportions would require a greater stoppage than our experiments will admit  and now on the contrary it appears that interceptions calculated according to the same hypothesis should be less than the results in the third table give them From which we conclude that every other proportion fixed upon would always be erronreous either in excess or in defect Equal contradictions may be shewn to attend all endeavours to account for the results contained in our fourth table by ad mitting any visible heat at all let the quantity be what it will To lmake the proof of this general let ioooo be the total heat and assume x for that part ofit which we would suppose to beon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat r9 occasioned by visible rays then will looo  x be the remainder which must be ascribed to rays that cannot be seen Now by our table we find that crown glass of which one side has been rubbed on emery stops 854 rays of light These alone if not a particle of invisible heat were stopped would be equal to 854 X visible rays of heat that must be intercepted by the glass When the other side of this glass has also been rubbed on emery it will stop 932 rays of light which will give 932 x for the quantity of heat to be intercepted on the same supposition that all invi sible rays of heat are transmitted But by our fourth table we have the actual stoppage of heat of these glasses which will therefore give us the two following equations 854 X  464 and 932 x  667 Then taking the first from the last and reducing the remaining equation we obtain x  3 for the P07 8 visible part of the total heat But 203 or 2602 being only a 078 part comes out greater than looo which is the whole and this being absurd it follows that visible rays of heat cannot be admitted in any proportion whatsoever This will equally hold grood with any additional stoppage of invisible heat provided it be equal in both glasses and of this equality the 165th and 167th experiments can leave us no room to doubt But it is high time that we should now take into consideration a more direct proof which may be drawn from our prismatic experiments The results of them are here brought into a table as follows 3XXDr LRtscHExLs Experiments on the solar and TABLLE V Stoppage of

both sides rough 471   6oo Coach glass ditto  833   714 Calcined talc    737  889 As a necessary introduction to the decisive experiment I amn going to analyse I must remark that it has been shewn in a former Paper that the prism separates invisible heat from the co loured spectrum by throwing that which is less refrangible than light to one side But it has also been proved that heat of the same variety in refrangibility as the different colours is likewise contained in every part of the coloured spectrum The question which we are discussing at present may therefore at once be reon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 52t duced to thissingle point Is the heat whichhas the refrangibility of the red rays occasioned by the light of these rays For should that be the case as there will then be only one set of rays one fate only can attend them in being either transmitted or stopped according to the power of the glass applied to them We are now to appeal to our prismatic experiment upon the subject which is to decide the question First with regard to light I must anticipate a series of highly interesting observations I have made but which though they certainly claim cannot find room in this Paper These have given me the means of acting sepa rately upon either of the extremes or on the middle of the pris matic spectrum and by them I am assured that red glass does not stop red rays Indeed the appearance of objects seen through such coloured glasses till I can give those observations will be a sufficient proof to every one that they transmit red light in abundance Next with regard to the rays of heat the case is just the reverse for by our preceding table the red glass stops no less than 692 out of a thousand of such rays as are of the refrangibility of red light The incipient stoppage moreover or that in two minutes of which something will be said hereafter amounts even to 75o rays Now if it should be suspected  that on account of the great breadth of prism some invisible heat may be thrown upon the spot where the red colour falls I do not only agree to it but am certain it cannot be otherwise but this again will give addi tional weight to our present argument for by the 153d experi ment as our last table shews it has already been ascertained that all such heat will be transmitted through a red glass so that were it not for some of this admixture the stoppage might be still greater522 Dr HERSCHELS xperime tsQon the iolar and Here then we have a direct and simple proof in the case of the red glass that the rays of light are transmitted while those of heat are stopped and that thus they have nothing in common but a certain equal degree of refrangibility which by the power of the glass must occasion them to be thrown together into the place which is pointed out to us by the visibility of the rays of light The manifest use of the union of these rays arising from their equal refrangibility will be explained at a future opportu unity when I may perhaps lthrow out several hintsthat have already occurred to me where the contents of this Paper may be applied to the useful purposes of life There still remains a general argument that heat and light are occasioned by different rays which ought not to be omitted This on account of the contracted state in which the experi ments have been given cannot appear from my Paper but by an inspection of them at full length it is proved that the stop page of solar heat setting aside little irregularities to which all observations are liable has constantly been greater in the first second or third minute than in the fourth or fifth or more accurately nearer the beginning of the five minutes than about the end of them Now this does not happen in the transmission of light which as far as we know is instantaneous at least a failure in the brightness of an object when first we look at it through a glass amounting to one two or even three minute could not possibly have escaped our observation This seems to suggest to us that the law by which heat is transmitted is different from that which directs the passage of light and in thatcase it must become an irrefragable argument of the diffe rence of the rays which occasion themon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 523 The surmise of a difference in the law of the transmission of heat and of light is considerably supported by an argument drawn from circumstances of a very different nature In the scattered transmissions arising from rough surfaces we find that when crown glass for instance has one of its sides rubbed on emery it will stop 205 rays of heat more than while that surface re mained polished  but the effect of the roughness produced by emery scratches isfar more considerable on the rays of light the additional stoppage of them amounting to no less than 65i A confirmation of the same effect we have in coach glass which having also one side rubbed on emery stops only t7 rays of heat more than it did before while there is an additional stoppage of rays of liglht amounting to no less than 71 7 Now since the interior construction of these glasses before and after having been rubbed on emery remains the same these remark able effects can only be ascribed to the roughness of their sur faces Hence we may conclude that as the same cause when it acts upon the rays of heat and light produces effects so very different it can only be accounted for by admitting the rays themselves to be of a diffirent nature and therefore subject to a different law in being scattered It has already been shewn that the rays of heat are upon an average less refrangible than those of light and now it appears that they are also if I may introduce a convenient term less scatterable We ought now also to take a short review of the phenomena attending the transmissionof terrestrial heat The results of the experiments which have been given are drawn into one view in the following tableS24 Dr

that occasion Heat 25 Let us now examine what information we may draw from the facts which are recorded in this table The first that must occur is that a candle which emits light is also a copious source of invisible heat If this should seem to require a proof I give it as follows That the candle emits heat along with light the thermometer has ascertained and that a considerable share of this at least must be invisible follows from comparingtogether the quantity of light and heat which are stopped by different glasses The bluishwhite one for instance stops 86 rays of light and 625 of heat Hence if only visible rays of heat came from the candle a glass stopping more light as for instance the darkred glass which stops 9998 ought to stop all heat whatsoever but the fact is that it even stops one hundred rays less than the former This instance alone shews plainly that the existence of invi sible terrestrial heat in the flame of a candle is proved while on the contrary heat derived from rays that are visible remains yet to be established by those who would maintain that there are any such But for the sake of argument let us endeavour to explain how visible rays of heat may be reconciled with the contents of our 6th table Now although we must allow it may be said  that there is a certain quantity of candleheat which cannot be seen we are however at liberty to assign any ratio that this may bear to its visible heatrays Let us therefore begin with the bluish white glass and make the most favourable supposition we can in order to explain its phaenomena Visible or invisible it stops 625 rays of heat and also 86 of light Now as in the last column of the table we have likewise the proportional quantity of invisible heat it intercepts which is 700 out of a thousand MDCCC 3 Y526 Dr HEascnEL Experiments o the solar and  we meay surmise that the 914 rays of lights together with the 300 of the invisible rays which are transmitted make up the 375 rays of heat which pass through the glass Hence by algebra we have the number of invisible heatrays 878 and the number  of the visible ones 122 Then to try how this will answer if 1000 rays of light give 122 of heat 86 will give lo and if out of a thousand invisible rays 700 be stopped 878 will give 615 to be intercepted The sum of these will be 6295 which is exactly the number pointed out by our table Now this being a fair solution of one instance let us see how it will agree with some others Before I proceed however I cannot help remarking that the supporters of visible heatrays must feel themselves already considerably confined as our present argument will not allow them more than 122 of such rays out of a thousand Now if the assumption that terrestrial heat is owing to a mixture of visible and invisible rays in the proportion of 122 of the former to 878 of the latter be well founded it ought to explain every other phaenomenon collected in our table The purplecaloured glass stops 993 rays of light which according to our present hypothesis should stop 12i rays of heat it also stops 730 invisible rays which will give 641 rays of intercepted heat therefore this glass should stop 762 rays of heat out of every thousand that come from a candle but from our table we find that it stops no more than 52o so that 242 rays cannot be accounted for The glass with an olive colour burnt into it stops 984 rays of light or 120 of heat and 637 invisible rays or 559 of heat The sum is 679 which that glass should stop but it stops ac tually 792 so that as in the foregoing instance we had a defion the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 527 ciency of 242 rays we now have an excess of 1 1i which plainly shews that no hypothesis of any other proportion between the visible and invisible rays of heat can answer to both ases and that consequently not only the present but every other assump tion of this kind must be given up as erroneous I shall not enlarge on these arguments as I take them to be sufficiently clear to decide the question we have had under con sideration I also forbear going into an examination of what our sixth article which treats of scattered heat might afford in ad dition to the former arguments It may just be remarked that the 211th experiment points out a black object which scatters more heat than a white one  while the case as to light is well known to be the reverse The 2igth experiment also shews that the scattering of heat of gold paper is considerably inferior to that of black velvet whereas a contrary difference of a very great extent is pointed out between these two substances for black velvet scatters only 7 rays of light while the scattering of gold paper amounts to more than 124000 I am well aware that this difference will perhaps admit of a solution on other principles than those which relate merely to the laws of scat tering and confess that many experiments are still wanting to complete this article which cannot now be given but as this Paper is already of an unusual length I ought rather to apolo gize for having given so much than for not giving more 2Y5q8 Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and Table of the transmission of terrestrial scattered Light througig various Substances with a short Account of the Method by which the Results contained in this Table have been obtained The transmissions here delivered are called terrestrial and scattered to distinguish them from others which are direct and solar and in the use I have made of them in the foregoing Paper it has been supposed that lightmaking rays whether direct and solar or scattered and terrestrial are transmitted in the same manner or that the difference if there be any may not be considerable enough to affect my arguments materially Inthis I have only followed the example of an eminent optical writer who does not so much as hint at a possibility that there may be a diffierence Before I describe my apparatus I ought to mention that it is intirely founded on the principles of the author now alluded to and that no other difficulty occurs in the execution of his plan than how to guard properly against the scatterings of the lamp for the light which this will throw on every object must not be permitted to come to the vanes since these scatterings cannot remain equal on both vanes when one of them is moveable In the following construction the greatest difficulties have been removed and a desirable consist ency in the results of the experiments when often repeated hasl now been obtained A board about fourteen feet long and six inches broadt has two slips of deal an inch square fastened upon the two sides these make a groove for two short pieces to slide in backwards and forwards The two sliding pieces  carry each a small  See Traite dOptique page 16 Fig 5 Ouvragepostbume de M BOUGUER t See Plate XXVI Fig i I See Fig 2 and 3on thie terrestrial fays that occasion Heat 9 board or vane one towards the right the other towards the left but so as to meet in the middle and apparently to make but one when placed side by side The vanes are covered with a piece of fair white paper which is to reflect or rather to scatter light in every direction To one end of the board is fixed a circular piece of wood with an opening in it which is afterwards to be shut up by a small moveable piece intended for placing the transmitting objects upon This moveable piece contains two holes at the distance of 11 inch from centre to centre and  inch in diameter each Against the circular wooden screen and close over the opening in it is placed a lantern containing a lampt Its construction is such as to admit a currentof air to feed the flame from below by means of a false bottom and to let it out by a covered roof and the whole of the light by the usual contrivance of dark lanterns is thus kept within so as to leave the room in perfect darkness In the front that is towards the vanes the lantern has a sliding door of tinplate in which there is a parallelogram mic hole covered with a spout five inches long of the same shape Two or three such doors with different spouts and openings will be required to be put in according to the experiments to be made but the first will do for most of them A narrow arm is fastened to the long board which advances about three feet beyond the screen and carries a circular piece of pasteboard that has an adjustable hole in the centre through which the observer is to look when the experments are tQ be made At the farther end of the long board is a pulley over which a string fastened to the back of the slider that carries one of the vanes is made to pass This string returns under the  See Plate XXVI Fig  t See Fig SSjo Dr HERSCHELS Experiments on the solar and bottom of the long board towards the other end where close to the observer another pulley is fixed and after going also over this pulley it returns at the top of the board to the front of the same vane to which the other end of it is fastened at the back By pulling the string either way the observer may bring forward the moveable vane or draw it back at pleasure At the side of the long board is a scale of tens of inches m bered from the place of the flame of the lamp o Io 20o 30 40 and so on to i 60 A pair of compasses being applied from the last ten towards the vane ascertains its distance from the flame to as great an accuracy as may be required When the transmitting power of a glass is to be tried it must be placed over one of the holes of the small moveable piece which then is fastened with a button upon the opening left for it in the circular wooden screen Then looking through the hole of the pasteboard at the two vanes and bringing that which is seen through the glass near enough to give an image equally bright with that which is seen through the open hole the obser vation will be completed Having measured the odd inches by a pair of compasses or immediately by a scale we deduce as usual the transmitting power by taking double the logarithm of the distance of the farthest vane from the lamp froin double the logarithm of the distance of the nearest vane The remain ing logarithm is that of the transmitting power as compared to the light coming directly to the eye from the other vane I have now only to remark that the use of this instrument requires some practice especially when coloured glasses are to be examined it will however be found that the difference of the colour of the two objects when their light isl brought to an equality may be overcome by a little abstraction which isthe trestrial Rays that occasion 1reat required for the purpose for by attending only to brightness it has often happened to me that both objects appeared at last of the same colour which proved to be some mean between the two appearances considered separately Some glasses stop so much light that it will be advisable to take them by the assistance of an intermediate one Thus in stead of comparingthe open vane directly to a red glass I settle first the ratio of the violet one to that vane then taking the ratio of the red to the violet and compounding these two ratios the result will be more accurate The reason for this will be easily comprehended when the construction of the appal ratus is considered For a red glass immediately compared to the open vane would require its object to be brought extremely near the lamp while the other must remain at a very great distance This would occasion a considerable difference in the angles both of incidence and of reflection between the rays falling on one vane and on the other But by dividing the observation into two operations we avoid the errors that might be occasioned by the former arrangement In the following table the first column contains the names of the different substances through which light has been trans mitted The second column shews the transmission of light expressed in decimal fractions or the proportion which it bears to the whole incident light considered as unity An arithmre tical complement to this fraction or what it wants to unity will therefore give us the proportion of light which is stopped by each of the substances contained in the first column and that quantity multiplied by mooo is placed in the third column53e IDr HERSCHELS Experiments on the

been referred to in the preceding paper but as I made these experiments in a certain order I thought it would be acceptable to give the table at full length The first column gives the names of the objects and the second contains the number of rays of light scattered by them when compared to a standard of white paper which is sup posed to scatter one thousand TABLE VIII White paper scatters

be distinguished from white and that on bringing it a little nearer to the light than it should be to make them perfectly equal any of my friends who happened to be present would mistake the black for the white EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES Plate XX represents the spectrum of heat A S Q A and of light GI R Q G If a prism be placed in a window so as to throw the colours of light upon a table and Plate XX be laid under the colours so that they may respectively fall upon the places where their names are inserted then may these co lours be made to fit into their proper spaces by lowering or raising the prism at pleasure When the colours occupy their proper situations the line A Q will express the space over 3 Z 2DKHDr IEISCHELs Experiments on the solfar and which the prism by their different refrangibility scatters the rays of heat and the ordinates to A Q will nearly express the proportional elevations which a set of equichangeable thermo meters would experience when placed in the different situa tions of these ordinates Plate XXI Fig 1 A B is the box which holds the two thermometers No i and NTo a C is the board which contains the transmitting holes the slip of wood for supporting the glasses and the perpendicular pin for adjusting the angle D E are the boards joined together by hinges F is a slip of mahogany screwed to E G is the spring to confine the slip F which will keep the board D up to any angle less than 90 degrees Fig 2 is the cover for shutting the transmitting holes Plate XXII Fig 1 is the screen which may be elevated by the usual contrivance of springs at the back to any required height so as to permit the rays of the sun to pass through the opening in the middle and to fall upon the transmitting holes of the box A B in Plate XXI Fig 2 is a second upper part of the box A B in Plate XXI The first upper part being screwed off this is to be put on in stead of it when experiments with liquids are to be made It contains as before the two transmitting holes the slip of wood and the pin and it has moreover a small bracket fastened un der one of the holes on which the tube containing the liquid to be tried may be laid Fig 3 is a third upper part to the box A B of Plate XXI It contains two small holes for transmitting prismatic rays to the two thermometers A and B which must now be put into the box instead of No 1 and No  The parallel lines a b incloswon the terrestrial Rays that occasion Heat 537 ing the holes will direct any coloured rays to the thermometers and by drawing the red rays down to the lower parallels c or d invisible rays may be brought toenter the transmitting holes Fig 4 is a fourth upper part to the box A B Plate XXI It contains two large holes for admitting the rays of the sun to fall upon the objects on Fig 5 Fig a represents two tablets ab united they may be covered with any objects that are to be examined for instance a with white paper and b with black velvet These tablets by a pro per contrivance are brought under the holes of figure 4 where a button fastens them at the required distance Plate XXIII Fig i A B is the box which holds the thermo meters C D are the screens with the transmitting holes in them opposite the flame of E the candle F is a small weight stretch ing a string across the glass or other object placed upright against the transmitting hole of the screen D It may be carried round the screen C if required and hold a glass against the hole in it Fig 2 is the double cover in putting it on it must be passed over the candle downwards against the twotransmitting holes Plate XXIV represents a large screen with the shelf A B carrying four thermometers No i and No 5 opposite the transmitting holes and the other two as represented When the fire is properly prepared lift the screen by taking hold a little above A and B and set it close to the fire so that C D may touch the bottom of the grate then take hold of the ring E and pull the string far enough out to hang that ring on the hook F this will open the transmission holes when the expe riment is to begin Plate XXV Fig i is the box containing the thermometers538 Dr HRSCHELS dExperiments on the solar and The bricks are piled up as represented in Fig 3 The stove Fig 2 being prepared bring the stand and brickwork Fig 3 close to it and set also the two spare bricks which lie on the stand upon the front of the stove that no heat may pass from the top of it to the brick inclosure then put the box Fig i into the brickwork close up to the stove and begin the expe riment The ashhole should also be covered with a brick Plate XXVI Fig i represents the Photometer The hole at A is for the observer to look through that he may have a fixed station the vanes F and G are moveable By pulling the string at H G will be brought nearer the lamp placed at K and by drawing the same string at I it will be removed towards the vane F which latter may be fixed at any distance most convenient for the experiment Fig 2 and 3 shew the mechanism of the adjustable vane 2 and moveable one 3 There are however hooks on fig 2 which will occasionally receive the strings from the hooks on fig 3 when a motion of the left vane instead of the right is required Fig 4 contains two limiting holes B C over one of which C a glass may be laid This piece is to be buttoned on the rab bet of the screen at D E fig 1

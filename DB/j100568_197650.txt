Government by appropriations amounting to about 32500000 gold during the past five or six years Seven days were devoted to the trip under the scientific guidance of Dr Bose and the com plete section across the isthmus was seen from the Pliocene of the Atlantic slope through the upper Miocene and the middle Cretace ous to the crystalline schists and the associated metamorphosed lime stones of the heart of the sierra between Rincon Antonio and Chivela the granitic and porphyritic rocks of San Geronimo the Archaean gneisses and granites of Tehuantepec and the granitic in trusive rocks of Salina Cruz The excursionists were greatly im pressed with the extent and completeness of the preparations made at both harbours and along the railroad for handling the enormous quantities of freight that are expected as soon as the route is thrown open to traffic on January I I907 The very end of the Congress was saddened by the death from typhoid fever on Sunday October 14 of Dr Franz Stradal of Vienna Austria Dr Stradal was one of the younger members of the Congress being only 27 years old but he was a geologist of promise He contracted the fever on the northern excursion but he did not leave the party and go to the American Hospital in Mexico City until it was too late to save his life PHYSIOGRAPHY OF VIRGINIA BY G T SURFACE MS The surface features are so closely connected with the geological history and this in turn is so important in the determination of economic control that we will discuss the physiographic phase from the viewpoint of geologic grouping and sequence It is our purpose to give the reader a consistent portrayal of the Virginia landmass at logical intervals during its physiographic evolution The conclu sions arrived at are based upon the most accurate information obtain able in the absence of a complete topographic or physiographic sur vey of the State As viewed from the standpoint of origin the land mass divides itself into two major divisions I Appalachian Belt and II Coastal Plain Belt 741Physiography of Virginia APPALACHIAN BELTThe classification recognized under this division is somewhat arbitrary but we believe it is entirely in har mony with the similarity and continuity of geographic control which centred about the original Atlantic landmass until towards the close of the Mesozoic era A Archaean system of the Archaean period B Taconic system of the Middle Silurian period C Appalachian system of the postCarboniferous period D Palisade system of the Jurassic period A The Archaean System This represents the older Appalachian belt or the Appalachian protaxis which extends in a narrow peninsular band from Canada to central Georgia It is continuous through Virginia and the present exposure varies in width from 10 to 40 miles It is probable that the materials of the Taconic and Palisade systems were de posited in valleys and bays which had been carved out of the Arch aean landmass or in synclinal troughs formed therein by elevation and depression This would indicate that the area extended farther eastward at the close of the period The enormous amount of ma terial supplied for the formation of the Appalachian system adds evidence to the same conclusion We can form no estimate of the height of the landmass but all of the conditions lead to the belief that it was thoroughly mountainous in type and probably varied from 5000 to 25000 feet in elevation Even with this estimate we must suppose it to have been a region of elevation during a part of the Paleozoic era to account for the immense sedimentary de posits of the Appalachian system The region suffered reelevation during the elevation of the Appalachian system as shown by the westnorthwest overthrust of the crystalline beds on the lower Si lurian beds and the intense metamorphism to which the rocks have been subjected Since the thrust force which produced the newer Appalachians was from the southwest the effect on the Archaean area must have been to increase the area along the western border and to make the topography more precipitous along the western flank of what might be designated the Piedmont Chain The Arch aean area was of sufficient elevation in postPaleozoic time to effect ually cut off the new Appalachian region from an eastward drain age The region varies in elevation from 300 to 1200 feet increas ing in general as we progress westward The drainage is entirely into the Atlantic and has a uniformly southeast direction The 742Physiography of Virginia Potomac Rappahannock York James and Roanoke Rivers are the most important streams They are transverse in that they flow at angles to the direction of strike of the intricately folded and foliated structure and they are antecedent in that their position was fixed prior to the rejuvenation of the old topography The watersheds between the drainage systems are indistinct which is characteristic of a region which has reached advanced maturity The valleys are usually narrow but productive and the interven ing ridges vary in productivity according to the conditions of pre vious cultivation the nature of the underlying rock and the degree of decomposition The percentage of iron present is greatest along the western border Large beds of iron ore occur in the Archaean series The rocks con sist chiefly of granites gneisses syenites dioritesgabbros and various schists and cover most of the region known as the Piedmont Plateau which extends from the Fall Line whlere the rivers emerge from the harder rocks of the inland on to the Coastal Plain to the slope and crest of the Blue Ridge These crystalline and metamorphosed rocks are believed to represent a part of the original crust of the earth and to have been first elevated by the unequal contraction of the outer cooling crust on the inner molten mass Most of the rocks weather easily by the decomposition of the iron alkalis and phos phates which when entirely removed leave a light sterile micaceous or sandy soil The percentage of these elements left largely de termines the productivity of the residual soils which makes a chem ical study of them very necessary for the intelligent application of fertilizers The present Piedmont topography is that of a dissected plateau upland the seaward remnant of a broad gently rolling surface which once extended westward beyond the Alleghany Front north ward along the Appalachians into New York and New England and southward across the Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee to an un known distance This peneplain condition of the Jurassic period was first described and studied by Professor W M Davis in Penn sylvania and New Jersey and was named by him the Schooley Peneplain Professor Davis describes the Piedmont Plateau in its present dissected stage as illustrative of the peneplain It is a peneplain not monotonously smooth but undulating in graceful swells between gentle depressionsDavis Mr Willis of the United States Geological Survey in his physiographic study of the  Davis W M  The Rivers of Northern New Jersey National Geographic Magazine I890 vol II pp 8zIIo 743Physiography of Virginia Northern Appalachians gave the name of Kittatinny Plain to this older baselevel stage B Taconic System Middle Silurian We will see under the discussion of the Appalachian System that at the beginning of the Paleozoic era there was being formed a great geosyncline along the western border of the Archaan landmass There was another geosyncline being formed at the same time along the eastern border The indications are that there was a chain of these depressions some of which were probably troughs of embayed synclinal valleys within the crystalline area They were closely parallel to the Archmean protaxis and the Appalachian geosyncline and extended from the region which marks the boundary between Canada New England and New York through Pennsylvania Mary land and Virginia and southwestward These deposits thickened in the gradually sinking trough through the Cambrian and Ordo vician periods and at the close of the latter period were elevated into what has been called the Taconic System The upturning re sulted in great flexures and faults and extreme metamorphism The rocks present the same general characteristics as the Cambrian and Ordovician rocks of the Appalachian system with the addition that the shales sandstones and limestones are highly metamorphosed The shales of Buckingham County have been definitely identified as belonging to theTrenton and Hudson epochs and are a part of the Taconic series The beautiful mottled brown and reddish brown marbles of east Tennessee belong to the same series Hawkins and Knox counties It continued a region of elevation and therefore of denudation through the Upper Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Triassic and Jurassic periods for no beds with marine fossils have been found over the area The series has suffered greatly from decomposition and erosion which were facilitated by the crushing and disruption of the beds as caused by the violent crustal movements Great changes must have been wrought in the structure and sur face features of the Taconic area by the forces which raised the Appalachian geosyncline into the towering Appalachian Chain The residual soils from the metamorphosed limestones are the most productive which occur in this belt The shales and slates give rise to soils that are responsive to fertilizers and improved cultivation The streams cut across the strata as in the case of the crystalline series of the Archaean system  Bailey WillisPhysiography of the United States p 189 744Physiography of Virginia 745 C Appalachian System Throughout the long Paleozoic era the material for the construc tion of the Appalachian system was in process of formation at the expense of the surrounding crystalline area These sediments were deposited in a great geosynclinal trough in which the rate of sub sidence was so nearly equal to the rate of deposition that almost the entire thickness was accumulated in shallow water At the close of the era the crustal movements began through which the strata were elevated and compressed into a series of parallel inclined or overturned folds with an elevation of 20000 to 40000 feet In some places the overturned folds pass into overthrust faults One of these in the southern Appalachians of Virginia represents a dis location of 5000 to Ioooo feet by which the Lower Silurian lime stone is brought in juxtaposition with the Lower Carboniferous sand stone This fault so weakened the strata through crushing and dis ruption as to invite maximum erosion and decomposition result ing in the removal of all the strata above the Silurian H B Rogers pointed out that the lines of faults in Virginia are continuous with the flexures in Pennsylvania The faults may therefore be designated as fexure faults The structure of the Appalachians closely re sembles that of the Alps The thrust force however in the case of the Alps was toward the ocean while that of the Appalachians was from the ocean The pressure being greatest from the ocean side gave rise to asymmetrical and inverted folds and the mountain ranges decline into an elevated plateau on the landward side with feebly undulating or horizontal stratification This is exemplified in the West Virginia Highland and the Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee This high mountain region was worn down to an un dulating plain Schooley or Kittatinny peneplain during the Trias sic and Jurassic periods with surviving ridges here and there of more resistant structure Towards the close of the Jurassic period the region was sub jected to a moderate and gradual reelevation attaining a maximum in Virginia of 1400 feet Willis The archlines follow the gen eral strike direction of the Appalachian folds This period of ele vation rejuvenated the streams on the uplifted plain making the valleys deepest where the elevation was greatest and most shallow where the uplift was least A revolution of the drainage system was initiated over a part of the region in the denudation attack along the lines of induced weakness The change was greatest over the Appalachian region proper since most of the dynamical agencies work more effectively on sedimentary rock structure The excavaPhysiography of Virginia tion of the valleys along the belts of weaker structure has resulted in a physiography more nearly approaching the mountain type than existed at the close of the reelevation of the region Most of the remnant ranges and the intervening valleys are the result of cir cumdenudation the height of the ridges and the width of the val leys being the expression of the relative strength of the strata and the amount of subsequent elevation The transverse streams are contemporaneous with the larger longitudinal ones but have only been able to carve out for themselves narrow valleys or precipitous gorges From the standpoint of soil production they have added but little but their economic value cannot be overestimated since they have established natural locations for the great transportation routes across the Alleghany Mountains and present ideal conditions for the most economic utilization of their superior water power The Appalachian anticlinorium has lost its physiographic identity but it is readily revealed in a study of the structure as exposed by the stream dissection and surface denudation That part of the Appalachian System draining into the Atlantic Ocean is known as the Northern Appalachian while the part south of New River draining into the Gulf is the Southern Appalachian The following subdivisions of the system are readily recognized in a topographic study I Blue Ridge 2 Valley and 3 Appalachia i Blue Ridge This stands out as the most prominent physical feature in the State With an elevation of 1460 feet at Harpers Ferry where the Potomac breaks through the Blue Ridge it in creases southwestward being 3993 feet in Bedford County Peaks of Otter and reaches a maximum of 5700 feet in Balsam Moun tain Grayson County Virginia This is a continuous barrier from the Maryland to the North Carolina boundaries excepting four watergaps and occasional windgaps In its higher altitudes the crest line is marked by a hard resistant sandstone of the Lower Cam brian period The southern portion expands into a fanlike plateau which is the watershed for the waters flowing into the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico The counties of Floyd Carrol Grayson Franklin and a part of Montgomery are situated in the plateau portion In North Carolina the plateau topography is inten sified and the elevation increases to a maximum of 7000 feet The eastern flank of the Blue Ridge consists for the most part of highly metamorphosed Archaean rocks which formed the Paleozoic shore of the interior sea and were thrust up by the great forces which gave birth to the Appalachian System Along the crest the 746Physiography of Virginia western flank and the western foothills the Cambrian rocks pre dominate Wellidentified fossiliferous shales of the Lower and Middle Cambrian occur near Natural Bridge and at Balcony Falls James River gorge through the Blue Ridge at Balcony Falls So far as developed for minerals this is the most unproductive region in the State 2 The Valley This is a continuation of the Great Valley of east Tennessee and becomes the Cumberland Valley in Maryland and Pennsylvania the Kittatinny Valley of New Jersey and the Newburg part of the Hudson River Valleyin New York It is the central part of the Greater Appalachian Valley as described by Willis which includes the Blue Ridge the Valley and the Alle ghany Ridges The Valley region is that which lies between the western base of the Blue Ridge and the eastern base of the Alle ghany Front It is 15 to 30 miles in width and 3Io miles in length making an area of about 5000 square miles It consists of the following minor valleys The Shenandoah Io6 miles James River 50 miles Roanoke River 38 miles New River 54 miles and Holston River 52 miles For the purposes of convenience we may recognize three general sections The northern or Shenandoah Val ley section the central embracing that region between the head waters of the Shenandoah and the Holston Rivers which is cut by the transverse valleys of the James Roanoke and New Rivers and the southern section that part drained by the Holston River Viewed topographically it is a broad gently rolling plain with the floor dissected by minor drainage systems The elevation in creases southwestward and westward being 242 feet above tide at the mouth of the Shenandoah and 1687 feet where the Holston River crosses the State line The maximum elevation of Ioo00 feet is reached in Wythe County The Shenandoah Plain was carved out of the Schooley Peneplain during the Tertiary period and the subsequent elevation and denudation have brought it to its present topographic condition The soil of the valley is prevailingly limestone and it is by far the most productive of the natural divisions George Washington realized its great possibilities when he wrote In soil climate and production in my opinion it will be considered if it is not con sidered so already as the Garden of America There is no marked decrease of fertility as we pass from the bottoms to the uplands The bottoms are utilized intensively and extensively for cultivation and the uplands for grazing  Letter to Sir John Sinclair I796 747Physiography of Virginia Settlements were made in the region as early as 1732 Several of the earlier ones were exterminated but the natural conditions were so favourable that each depredation by the Indians inspired the settlers to stronger and more persistent resistance The position of the Valley topographically marks it out as a natural transportation route so we find the Norfolk and Western Railroad traversing it from Bristol which is on the VirginiaTen nessee line to Roanoke from this point the Shenandoah Valley extends to Harpers Ferry on the VirginiaWest VirginiaMary land line 3 Appalachia or Alleghany Ridges This area embraces the region between the Valley and the Alleghany Front which is the eastern border of the Alleghany Plateau and is made of a series of ridges of northeastsouthwest direction alternating with narrow troughlike valleys This general topography is interrupted where intersected by the transverse valleys previously referred to An ex amination of the ridges shows a remarkably accordant topography They are believed to be the remnant of a plain of advanced topo graphic maturity formed during the Mesozoic era which was continuous from Piedmont to the Alleghany Plateau called by Davis the Schooley Peneplain and by Willis the Kittatinny Peneplain The region under discussion has been reduced to its present topo graphic condition since the Jurassic period by denudation and periods of elevation The ridges owe their elevation chiefly to the fact that the Car boniferous conglomerates and sandstones were depressed below the general level of the Kittatinny Perneplain and thus escaped being worn away during the production of that feature Subsequent elevation and denudation have removed the weakened anticlinal rocks and left the synclinal remnants of hard sandstone standing out in relief as protecting caps to the softer strata beneath Like the land of the Valley the Blue Ridge and the Alleghany Front these ridges increase in general elevation southward Many of them exceed 3000 feet Elliots Knob 20 miles west of Staun ton has an elevation of 4473 feet The Appalachia and Valley topography of southwest Virginia has been materially influenced by a series of faults which produced a displacement of 500 to I2000 feet The most important we may designate the Saltville or North Holston fault with a maximum dis placement of Ioooo feet the Walker Mountain fault with a max imum displacement of about ooo000 feet and seemingly continuous with the Great Fault of Northern Virginia and Draper Mountain 748Physiography of Virginia fault which by a maximum displacement of I2500 feet brings up the Lower Silurian in Wythe and Pulaski County as a rugged moun tain in the heart of the Valley Two crossfaults pass from it the Max Meadows in a westward direction and the Pulaski in a north western direction toward the Walker Mountain fault so that in the very heart of the Valley there is a block of Upper Silurian Devonian and Lower Carboniferous with Lower Silurian on two sides Cambrian on the third and Lower Carboniferous on the fourth The soils of the upper slopes are usually sandy and sterile be ing derived from the heavy siliceous sandstones and conglomerates Beneath these strata occur the softer shales some of which the most calcareous form fairly productive soils The residual soils from limestone are always fertile but most of the limestone strata have been removed by denudation Because of the very broken topography common to the region it is best adapted to grazing The narrow valleys are made up of sandy calcareous alluvium with often a strong impregnation of iron and are productive Cultivation is concentrated on the valleys and lowlands More virgin forest survives in this belt than in any other part of the State because of its inaccessibility With the superior water power which abounds throughout the region the manufacture of hardwood products should become an important industry This is the most productive region of the State in mineral re sources The bold southeastwardfacing escarpment of the Alleghany Plateau border constitutes the western border of the Alleghany trough The State line is approximately marked by it except in the southwest corner From Little High Knob 26 miles south of the Potomac in the VirginiaWest Virginia boundary southwestward it declines in elevation New River flowing northwestward enters the plateau in a cafion I500 feet deep All the other streams crossing the Front rise in the plateau and flow southwestward to emerge from deep canons into the minor valleys of the Great Valley This peculiar drainage adjustment was brought about by a southeastward tilting of the northern part of the plateau in the elevation subsequent to the Schooley Peneplain stage while south of the New River divide the tilting was to the southwestt  American Journal of Science i887 p 262  Russell I C Rivers of North America p 205 74750 Physiography of Virginia D Palisade System Jurassic Period At the beginning of the Triassic period it is probable that the Vir ginia land area extended farther east than it does at this time During this period a series of narrow troughs was formed along the Atlantic slope closely parallel to the trend of the Appalachians as if occupy ing orographic valleys in the chain but separated from them by the remnant ridges which were still sufficiently high to effectually cut off the Appalachian drainage from the east The depressions could not have been formed from an oceanic submergence for no marine fossils have been found in the beds neither could they have resulted from stream action alone or the nature of the rock structure would be different The most probable supposition therefore is that the depressions represent the topography of the continental border after the Appalachian upturning The water accumulated in these de pressions in estuaries freshwater lakes streams bogs and swamps and the depositions took place slowly and to great depth The rocks are mostly granitic sandstones sandy shales conglomerates bitu minous coal along with carbonaceous shales The extent of the conglomerate formation and the prevalence of the crossbedded structure give evidence of the presence of strong currents The longest trough seems to have been continuous from the Hud son River south through New Jersey and Maryland and into Vir ginia as far as Cumberland County a distance of 350 miles It is probable that the Richmond area was a separate basin 35 miles in length and that the Pittsylvania area belongs to the Dan River trough of North Carolina Ioo miles in length 40 miles in North Carolina The thickness of the beds in Virginia varies from 2000 to 3000 feet Productive coal beds occur in the Richmond basin south of the Chickahominy River being northwest of the city of Richmond and separated from the northern part of the Richmond Mesozoic area by an interval of crystalline rocks about 3 miles in width This is the only Mesozoic area in Virginia which retains the basin form in its present structural condition The lateral pressure whch caused the elevation of the series was chiefly from the west while that for the Appalachian system was chiefly from the east The elevation took place at the close of the Triassic or in the early Jurassic period Faults are frequent and volcanic action became general as shown by the numerous dykes which cut the series The crustal movements however over most of the region resulted U S G S Bull No 85 892  American Journal of Science 1879Physiography of Virginia in monoclinal uplifts of low angle Flexures are rare and local the largest being that of the Richmond Basin The Jurassic period was one of great denudation when the high ranges of the Appalachians were much wasted away and the newly elevated Triassic beds were deeply eroded The brown sandstone of this series supplies one of our most valuable building stones COASTAL PLAINAt the close of the Jurassic period there was a slight elevation but this was of short duration and gave place to a strong eastward tilting of the land which permitted the western transgression of the Upper Potomac formation The Potomac series was formerly classified as Lower Cretaceous by Davist and others but the very careful stratigraphic work of the Maryland Geological Survey has led to the classification of the lower beds of the series to the Jurassic The Coastal Plain Series begins with the Potomac Groupt which were formed in a narrow band along the Atlantic Coast Detached portions of the beds indicate that they formerly extended farther westward The different members of the Coastal Plain series were formed by alternate periods of elevation and depression It is beyond the province of this discussion to enter into a detailed description of the geological history The series consists of sands clays loams and gravels usually in the unconsolidated state and arranged almost horizontally The Tertiary period was inaugurated by an encroachment of the sea and the Eocene deposits of sands and clays formed in a narrow band through New Jersey Maryland and Virginia From Virginia southward the deposits become much broader The crustal move ments which closed the period were greater from south to north and from east to west giving a southeast tilting This is true for the whole Coastal Plain series as evidenced by the thickness of the beds and the resulting topography One of the salient topographic evi dences is the increase in the southeastward deflection of the streams along the western border of the Coastal Plain along the Fall Line The early Miocene witnessed a slight transgression of the sea as a result of which the Upper Miocene beds were deposited on the Lower Eocene By the close of the period the Atlantic and Gulf shores had attained almost their present outline A broad belt extending from the Piedmont margin to the centre of  Physiography of Maryland Part II p 144 t The Geological Dates of Origin of Certain Topographic

interstream area These consist of clay loam sand and gravel the latter being often ferruginous and cemented into a com pact ironstone The formation has an average thickness of about 50 feet With the close of the Tertiary the Atlantic Coast was raised about oo00 feet in the Virginia portion On passing from Piedmont to the Coastal Plain the stream character changes abruptly from rapids falls and steep gorges to meandering streams over a terracebound lowland The terraces were formed by the floodplain condition ex isting during the Pleistocene period The great number of bays and estuaries are of comparatively recent origin having been formed by the gradual subsidence of the Coastal Plain region by which the rivers were drowned in their lower course through the transgression of the ocean The Susque hanna River formerly entered the ocean east of Cape Henry and the Potomac James York and Rappahannock were its important tribu taries The continued depression converted the lower Susquehanna Valley into the Chesapeake Bay and embayed the mouths of the lower tributaries making them tidal streams Accomac and Northampton Counties became thereby separated from the mainland The effect was to make all of the important streams navigable in the Coastal Plain part of their course and it gave to the State in the formation of Hampton Roads estuary at the mouth of the James River the finest American harbour The elevation increases from sealevel to I50 feet on the western border From the surface configuration the land is commonly desig nated as first and second bottom and the ridge country The first bottom where protected from the tide is very productive It is in this portion that most of the swamp and marsh lands occur all of which are covered with a variety of swamp and marsh grasses which are partially utilized for grazing Wherever this has been reclaimed it is exceedingly productive Dismal Swamp being the most notable example No survey or special study has been made of these wild lands but there is no doubt but that hundreds of square miles could be reclaimed at a cost which would leave a wide margin of profit The second bottom is alluvial as the first and is the most valuable part of Tidewater The subsoil is a dark red or yellow clay with a moderate admixture of sand The surface soils consist of sandy loams which vary in colour and consistency

represents one of the most important economic problems in the State Calcareous marls have proved very beneficial and it is believed by some fertilizer authorities that most of the area can be brought into a state of at least fair productivity Emory and Henry College Emory Virginia DR ROLLIN A HARRIS THEORY OF THE TIDES BY G W LITTLEHALES In a manner characteristic of a master of the facts of observation in relation to the tides and as the author of forms of computation for the analysis and classification of tidal records which constitute the greatest advance in practical tidal work since the introduction of the harmonic analysis Dr Harris has addressed himself to the task of outlining a tidal theory which shall account for the tides as they are actually observed to exist in nature His preliminary studies of the causes of the tides led him to attempt to mark out in the oceans and other bodies of water such areas or systems of areas as are capable of independent oscillation in the same or nearly the same period as the tidal forces have and in which it is possible for the tidal forces to cause the tide to mount up to a considerable ampli tude and then to obtain theoretical results with reference to these areas under the supposition that the tidal forces are distributed over the waters of each system and that the times of elongation of the water particles are thus determined with reference to the tidal body Having compared these theoretical results with the observed values he announced that in most cases the dominant ocean tides have their origin in definite systems whose free periods of oscillation are very nearly those of the tidal forces and that the time of high or low water in each is the time when the virtual work of the tidal forces upon the system becomes zero For the semidiurnal tides the systems pointed out are seven in  Manual of Tides Part IV A Appendix No 7Report for I900 c Coast and Geodetic Sur Part IV B Appendix No 5Report for I904  vey

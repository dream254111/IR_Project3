J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107365,SOME FARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN PREVAILS TO THE WESTWARD OF THE SCILLY ISLANDS,I206970,C 182 2 XI SOME FARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN PREVAILS TO TKE WESTWARD OF THE SCILLY ISLANDS BY JAMES RENNELL ESQ FRS READ APRIL 13 1815 DUMRING THE INTERVAL OF 21 YEARS SINCE THE SOCIETY DID ME THE HONOUR TO RECEIVE MY OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT TO THE WESTWARD OF SCILLY MORE FACTS RELATING TO THAT CURRENT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED AS WELL AS OBSERVATIONS ON ITS EFFECTS IN DIF FERENT PARTS OF ITS COURSE BETWEEN CAPE FINISTERRE AND SCILLY THE WHOLE TENDING TO A CONFIRMATION OF THE GENERAL SYSTEM SET FORTH IN 1793 AND IN ONE INSTANCE AFFORDING PERHAPS A CLEARER PROOF OF THE STRENGTH OF THE STREAM IN RESPECT OF ITS NORTHERLY DIRECTION THAN ANY OF THOSE ADDUCED ON THE FORMER OCCASION IN PURSUING THE DETAIL OF THESE FACTS AND OBSERVATIONS I SHALL BEGIN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF CAPE FINISTERRE AND PRO CEED WITH THE COURSE OF THE CURRENT ALONG THE BAY OF BISCAY AND THENCE ACROSS THE MOUTH OF THE BRITISH CHANNEL TO SCILLY AND THE ENTRANCE OF ST GEORGES CHANNEL THE THREE FIRST FACTS REGARD THE CURRENT FROM THE OPEN SEA SETTING INTO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE BAY OF BISCAY AND ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF SPAIN WHICH CURRENT HAS BEEN SUPPOSED IN THE FORMER PAPER TO BE OCCASIONED BY THE PREVALENT WESTERLY WINDS WHICH FORCE THE WATER NEAR THE SHORE INTO HE BAY AND ALONG THE SOUTHERN COAST OF IT THE WATER SO DISPLACED WOULD BE FOLLOWED OF COURSE BY THE ADJACENT WATER BEHIND ITFARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT C 183 IN THE OPEN SEA AND SO ON SUCCESSIVELY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THIS CAUSE AND NOT THE EFFECT OF THE GULFSTREAM EXTENDED TO THE COASTS OF EUROPE AS SOME HAVE SUPPOSED MUST SURELY BE REFERRED TO AS THE ORIGIN OF THE SCILLY CURRENT I THE FIRST CASE IS THAT OF THE EARL CORNWALLIS EAST INDIA SHIP THE CIRCUMSTANCE OCCURRED ON HER OUTWARD PASSAGE SHE WAS WELL PROVIDED WITH TIME KEEPERS AS MOST OF THE INDIA SHIPS ARE ON THE 1 TH MARCH 1791 BETWEEN THE PARALLELS OF 430 AND 440 AND AT SO 45 OF LONGITUDE WEST OF CAPE FINISTERRE ABOUT 53 LEAGUES THIS SHIP EXPERIENCED AN EASTERLY CURRENT EQUAL TO 26 MARINE MILES HER POSITION BEING DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO THE LINE OF THE SOUTHERN COAST OF THE BAY OF BISCAY IT IS A FAIR CONCLUSION THAT THE CURRENT WAS OCCASIONED BY THE CAUSE ABOVEMNENTIONED OR AS SEAMEN CALL IT THE INDRAUGHT OF THE BAY WHICH IT APPEARS EXTENDS TO AT LEAST 53 LEAGUES FROM THE SHORE AND AS THE RATE IN THIS PLACE EXCEEDS ONE MILE PER HOUR IT MAY BE SUPPOSED THAT THE EFFECT EXTENDS TO A STILL GREATER DISTANCE IT MAY HERE BE REMARKED THAT THE SAME SHIP IN COMING OUT OF THE CHOPS OF THE CHANNEL A FEW DAYS BEFORE WAS SET TWENTY FOUR MILES TO THE WESTWARD 15 TO THE NORTHWARD IN THE COURSE OF THE 24 HOURS THAT IS 28 MILES IN A DIRECTION OF N W BY W THIS MAY BE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME STREAM OF CURRENT IN ITS COURSE FROM THE BAY TOWARDS SCILLY II THE SECOND FACT IS THAT OF THE DRIFT OF A BOTTLE WHICH WAS THROWN OUT OF A DANISH SHIP I BELIEVE SENT ON DIS COVERY SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE FORMER PAPER THE BOTTLE WAS THROWN OUT IN LAT 44 L ON 12 WEST FROM GREENWICH THAT IS ABOUT 48 MILES TO THE N E OF THE CORN184 FARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN WALLISS STATION AT THE TIME THAT SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THE CURRENT ON THE UNTH MARCH IT WAS TAKEN UP BY A CENTINEL ON DUTY NEAR CAPE ORTEGAL AND AS WAS SUPPOSED AT THE MOMENT OF ITS DRIVING INTO THE SURF IJF THIS WAS REALLY THE FACT THE BOTTLE ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF THE LETTER CONTAINED IN IT MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED AT THE RATE OF HALF A MILE PER HOUR IN THE DIRECTION OF ABOUT E B S 2 S THE DISTANCE WAS ABOUT 61 LEAGUES THE REPORT OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS TRANSMITTED BY THE FRENCH CONSUL AT CORUNNA TO THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT PARIS IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT THE DRIFT OF THE BOTTLE WAS MUCH TO THE SOUTH OF EAST WHEREAS THAT OF THE CORNWALLIS WAS EAST THAT IS BOTH POINTED TOWARDS CAPE ORTEGAL OR ITS VICINITY AS IF THE MAIN STREAM OF THE CURRENT WAS CONCEN TRATED THERE WITH RESPECT TO THE VELOCITY OF THE CURRENT IN THE PRESENT CASE ALL OF COURSE DEPENDS ON THE TIME OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE BOTTLE AT THE SHORE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THROWN UP LONG BEFORE IT WAS SEEN AND WASHED OFF AGAIN BY THE TIDE OR SURGE OF THE SEA THE DIRECTION THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT CANNOT BE QUESTIONED III THE THIRD FACT IS VERY SIMPLE AND PERFECTLY CONCLUSIVE OFF CAPE ORTEGAL AT A CONSIDERABLE OFFING ADMIRAL KNIGHT FOUND THE CURRENT AT THE RATE OF ONE MILE PER HOUR SETTING TO THE E S E THAT IS NEARLY ALONGSHORE THE READER WILL IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVE THAT THESE THREE IT IS OBSERVED THAT IN THE MOUTH OF THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR BETWEEN C ST VINCENT AND C CANTIN THE CURRENTS POINT IN ALL DIRECTIONS BETWEEN SE AND NE TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE OF THE STRAIT WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE PIPE OF A FUNNELPREVAILS TO THE WESTWARD OF THE SCILLY ISLANDS FACTS CONVERGE AS IT WERE TO ONE POINT THAT IS IN THE PROOF THAT THE WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC FLOW INTO THE BAY OF BISCAY ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF SPAIN IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE NORTHWESTERLY CURRENT BY SCILLY DID NOT AT LEAST IN MANY CASES BALANCE THE EASTERLY CURRENT ROUND CAPE ORTEGAL AND THE LAND OF FINISTERRE THE LOSS OF HIS MAJESTYS FRIGATE APOLLO WITH MOST OF HER CONVOY MAY SURELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATION OF THIS CURRENT CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS COMMISSIONER WALLIS ASSURED ME THAT AFTER HAVING MADE AS HE SUPPOSED AMPLE ALLOWANCE FOR CLEARING FINISTERRE YET IN THE NIGHT HE HAD A VERY NARROW ESCAPE FROM SHIPWRECK VERY MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE SAME KIND OF DANGER SO THAT THE LAND OF FINISTERRE WERE IT NOT DISCERNIBLE AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE AND ITS OFFING CLEAR OF ROCKS AND SHALLOWS AND MOREOVER SITUATED IN A FINER CLI MATE WOULD PROVE A KIND OF SCILLY TO MARINERS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY PROOFS ON RECORD CON CERNING THE COURSE OF THE CURRENT ROUND THE BAY OF BISCAY I FORMERLY COLLECTED SOME INFORMATION FROM A FRENCH COM MANDER RESPECTING IT HE SAID THAT THE SETTING OF THE CURRENT ALONG THE COAST OF FRANCE TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST WAS A FACT WELL UNDERSTOOD AND EVEN ACTED ON BY MANY IN THE CHOICE OF THE TACK ON WHICH THE CURRENT GAVE THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE WITH DEAD WINDS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AND THAT A VERY STRIKING ONE IN RESPECT  NOR ADMITTING AN EQUAL RATE IN BOTH PLACES COULD IT WELL BE FOR THE CURRENT ENTERS THE BAY OF BISCAY IN AN EAST DIRECTION BUT GOES OFF FROM IT NORTHWEST SO THAT IF A SHIP WAS CARRIED FIFTY MILES TO THE NW FROM USHANT SHE WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE ABOUT THIRTYFIVE WESTING BUT IN THE OTHER CASE SHE WOULD BE CARRIED THE WBOLE FIFTY EASTWARD TOWARDS THE BAY AND CAPE FINISTERRE MDCCCXV B B I85FARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN OF THIS PARTICULAR IS THAT THE SOUNDINGS IN THE BAY OF BISCAY SHOW LITTLE OR NO MUDDY BOTTOM TO THE SOUTHWARD OF THE GARONNE RIVER BUT EVERY WHERE TO THE NORTHWARD THIS SEEMS TO SHOW THAT THE MUD OF THE GARONNE CHARANTE LOIRE C C IS ALL CARRIED TO THE NORTHWARD AND BY WHAT CAUSE BUT A NORTHERLY CURRENT HAD THE MOTION OF THE SEA BEEN VARIABLE THE MUD WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO THE SOUTH AS WELL AS THE NORTH OF THE MOUTH OF THE GARONNE THE ALLUVIAL EM BOUCHURES OF THE RIVERS IN GENERAL HERE AND THE POSITIONS OF THE BANKS FORMED BY THEM IN THE SEA POINT TO THE N OR NW APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF THE SAME SEA CURRENT IV IN CONTINTUATION OF THIS CURRENT ALONG THE BAY OF BISCAY I SHALL NEXT MENTION THAT CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS ADMIRAL JOHN PAYNE ASSURED ME THAT BEING IN HIS MAJESTYS SHIP RUSSELL IN A SEVERE GALE OF WIND AT SW AND WITH THE LEDGE OF ROCKS CALLED THE SAINTES NOT FAR TO LEEWARD HE WAS UNDER APPRE HENSIONS FOR THE SAFETY OF THE SHIP DURING A WHOLE NIGHT BUT TO HIS SURPRISE FOUND HIMSELF CARRIED CLEAR OF THE DANGER BY A CURRENT WHICH SET THE SHIP IN ALL ABOUT SEVENTY MILES TO THE NORTHWEST V THE FLOWING OF THE TIDES ON THE WEST OF SCILLY CANNOT WELL BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ANY OTHER SUPPOSITION THAN THAT THE FLOOD IS PROLONGED BY A SOUTHERLY CURRENT THE FLOOD TIDE IS  FROM A VIEW OF THE CHART OF SOUNDINGS BETWEEN SPAIN AND IRELAND ONE MIGHT BE LED TO SUPPOSE THAT THE DEEP WATER AND STEEP SHORE ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF SPAIN HAD BEEN PARTLY OCCASIONED BY THE WATER DRIVEN IN FROM THE ATLANTIC IN WES TERLY STORMS ALONG THAT COAST AND WHICH HAD GRADUALLY WORN AWAY THE MATTER THERE AND DEPOSITED IT ON THE BANK WHICH EXTENDS FROM BAYONNE TO THE WESTWARD OF IRE LAXD FOR THE BANK SEEMS TO EXPAND AS IT GOES NORTHWARD IN LIKE MANNER AS THE CURRENT AND THE WATER IS SHALLOWER THAN MIGHT BE EXPECTED IN PROPORTION TO THE DEPTHS FARTHER IN I86PREVAILS TO THE WESTWARD OF THE SCILLY ISLANDS KNOWN TO RUN NINE HOURS TO THE NORTHWARD BUT THE EBB IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ONLY THREE HOURS THIS PARTICULAR HAD NOT COME TO MY KNOWLEDGE WHEN THE PAPER OF 1793 WAS WRITTEN VI BUT THE MOST SATISFACTORY PROOF NOT ONLY OF THE EXIST ENCE OF A NORTHERLY CURRENT ATHWART THE MOUTHS OF THE BRITISH AND IRISH CHANNELS BUT ALSO OF ITS VELOCITY AT LEAST DURING CER TAIN INTERVALS IS A STATEMENT IN A BOOK PUBLISHED IN 1733 ENTITLED JOSHUA KELLYS TREATISE OF NAVIGATION IN TWO VOLUMES OCTAVO THIS CASE IS THE MORE SATISFACTORY AS IT HAPPENED IN A DEAD CALM OF FORTYEIGHT HOURS CONTINUANCE SO THAT ALL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF A SEA RECKON ING ALLOWANCES FOR LEEWAY DRIFT C IS PRECLUDED SINCE THE CHANGES OF POSITION THAT TOOK PLACE COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN EFFECTED BY THE MOTION OF THE SEA EITHER IN THE NATURE OF A CURRENT OR OF A TIDE AND THIS LATTER MUST BE PLACED OUT OF THE QUESTION SINCE THE INTERVAL OF TIME INCLUDED NO LESS A SPACE THAN THAT IN WHICH FOURFLUXES AND AS MANY REFLUXES HAVE THEIR PERIODS SO THAT THEY MAY WELL BE SUPPOSED TO BALANCE EACH OTHER IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED SAYS MR KELLYT BY AN EXPERI  ENCED COMMANDER WHO USED THE WEST INDIA VOYAGES FOR MANY YEARS FROM ENGLAND IN HIS RETURN FROM ONE OF  THESE THAT IN ABOUT THE LATITUDE OF 48 30 OPEN WITH OUR BRITISH CHANNEL HAVING A GOOD OBSERVATION OF LATITUDE AT  THE SAME TIME IT PROVING CALM AND SMOOTH WATER INSOMUCH  THAT HE HANDED HIS SAILS AND SOLAY FORTYEIGHT HOURS THE  THIS WAS ORIGINALLY POINTED OUT TO ME BY MR JOHN PURDY THE VERY ABLE HYDROGRAPHER EMPLOYED BY MESSRS LAWRIE AND WHITTLE FLEETSTREET  VOLUME THE FIRST PAGE 434 BB 187188 FARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN FIRST TWENTYFOUR HOURS AT NOON HE OBSERVED THE LATITUDE AGAIN WITH CLEAR WEATHER AND FOUND BY THE SAME THAT HE HAD DROVE TO THE NORTHWARD TWENTY MILES WHICH MADE HIM DISTRUST HIS FORMER OBSERVATION THOUGH HIS MATE AGREED WITH HIM BECAUSE THE SHIP HAD NOT GONE TO HIS KNOWLEDGE ONE MILE AND UPON REVIEW HE FOUND THAT HE WAS NOT MIS TAKEN THE NEXT TWENTYFOUR HOURS BEING STILL CALM HE HAD AGAIN ANOTHER GOOD OBSERVATION AND THEN FOUND HIM SELF ABOUT TWENTYSIX MILES TO THE NORTHWARD OF HIS LAST OBSERVATION WHICH CONFIRMED HIM THAT HE WAS RIGHT THE DAY BEFORE AND THAT THIS MUST BE IMPUTED TO A STRONG NORTHERN INDRAUGHT OR CURRENT THERE FOR WHEN YOU COME  NEAR THE SOUNDINGS AND TILL YOU BRING USHANT SOUTH OF YOU  ON THE ESE COURSE YOU WILL HARDLY HOLDYOUR LATITUDE AND THE GENERAL COURSE IS E NE OR E B N IF BUT A SMALL MATTER TO THE SOUTHWARD OF LATITUDE 49 AND HE SAYS  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY COURSE IF WE HAD NOT MET THIS OPPORTUNITY OF DISCOVERING THIS STRONG INDRAUGHT AND FOR WANT OF OBSERVATION LI E IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN THE LATI TUDEJ MUST HAVE RUN UP ST GEORGES CHANNEL OR THE NORTH CHANNEL AS MANY HAVE AND STILL DO FOR WANT OF THE SAME  INFORMATION3 AFTER HIS LAST OBSERVATION THE WIND SPRANG UP AND  MAKING ALLOWANCE FOR THE SAID INDRAUGHT I E IN HIS FUTURE  COURSE3 THE NEXT DAY HE WAS BROUGHT INTO SOUNDINGS AND THE FOLLOWING DAY HE WAS BROUGHT IN SIGHT OF THE LIZARD BY STEERING TO THE SOUTHWARD OF THE EASTT  THESE ARE COMPASS BEARINGS THE MAGNETIC VARIATION AT THAT TIME BEING ABOUT A POINT AND A HALF WESTERLY THESE WILL BE RESPECTIVELY E I S NE J E AND ENE N N TRUE T MEANING NO DOUBT THE ESE COURSE BY COMPASS AS ABOVE OR TRUE ESPREVAILS TO THE WESTWARD OF THE SCILLY ISLANDS IT WILL NATURALLY OCCUR TO THE READER THAT ALTHOUGH THIS CASE GIVES THE NORTHING ONLY YET THAT IN RESPECT OF THE MAIN QUESTION WHICH IS THE DANGER OF SHIPWRECK ON SCILLY OR OF BEING CARRIED INTO THE BRISTOL CHANNEL IT IS SULFICIENT TO PRO DUCE A CONVICTION OF THE NECESSITY OF ATTENDING CLOSELY TO THE SHIPS COURSE WHEN ON THE POINT OF ENTERING THE BRITISH CHANNEL AFTER OR DURING A COURSE OF STRONG WESTERLY OR SOUTHWEST WINDS BUT IT WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN MORE SATISFACTORY HAD THE DIRECTION OF THE STREAM BEEN KNOWN HAD THAT BEEN NORTHWESTERLY AS I HAVE BEFORE SUPPOSED THE RATE OF VELOCITY MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN A MILE AND A QUARTER PER HOUR OR APPROACHING TO ONE AND A HALF THE NORTH ING BEING TWENTYTHREE AT A MEAN IN THE TWENTYFOUR HOURS WHILST THAT IN THE ATLAS EAST INDIAMAN RECORDED IN A FORMER PAPER WAS ABOUT ONE MILE PER HOUR DURING FOUR DAYS CON SECUTIVELY THE STATEMENT IN MR KELLYS BOOK WHICH IS INDEED ALTO GETHER MORE BRIEF THAN COULD BE WISHED IS ALSO DEFECTIVE THROUGH THE WANT OF THE DISTANCE SAILED FROM THE PLACE OF THE LAST OBSERVATION FOR THE LATITUDE TO THAT FROM WHENCE THEY SAW THE LIZARD POINT THEY HAD THEIR FIRST SOUNDINGS THE DAY AFTER THAT OBSERVATION AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THEY SAW THE LIZARD HIS COURSE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN REGULATED WITH A VIEW OF PRESERVING NEARLY HIS PARALLEL OF 49 16 TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN CARRIED BY THE CURRENT IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT HE SOUNDED TO ANY GREAT DEPTH PERHAPS SEVENTY FATHOMS WHICH IN THAT PARALLEL MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOUT TWENTY LEAGUES SOUTHWEST FROM SCILLY AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT HE CONSI DERED HIMSELF IN SOUNDINGS WHEN THE CALM BEGAN WHICH 189FARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN HOWEVER IT IS PROBABLE HE WAS ALTHOUGH IN DEEP WATER ACCORDINGLY ONE MAY CONCEIVE THAT HIS POSITION AT THE END OF THE CALM MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE MERIDIAN OF CAPE CLEAR OR SOMEWHAT TO THE EASTWARD OF IT IT MUST BE RECOLLECTED THAT IN RUNNING TOWARDS THE CHANNEL AFTER THE CALM HE HAD STILL TO ENCOUNTER THE SAME ADVERSE CURRENT AND THAT POS SIBLY TO WITHIN THIRTY OR FORTY MILES OF HIS SEEING THE LIZARD BUT WHETHER HIS POSITION DURING THE TIME THAT HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE CURRENT BE A DEGREE MORE OR LESS TO THE EASTWARD THE FACT BEARS THE SAME ON THE MAIN QUES TION SINCE A SHIP IN CROSSING THE STREAM WHERESOEVER IT MAY BE SITUATED MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT OF HER RECKONING AND THEREBY PLACED IN DANGER IN THE EVENT OF THICK WEATHER HAP PENING SUBSEQUENTLY AND PREVENTING THEIR SETTING THEMSELVES RIGHT BY AN OBSERVATION OF LATITUDE HIS IDEA OF THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE STREAM IS WORTH REMARK ING AS IT APPROACHES IN A GENERAL VIEW TO THE TRUTH IT WAS THAT IN ABOUT THE PARALLEL OF 49 IT APPROACHED TO THE MERIDIAN OF USHANT AND WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECTION OF THE STREAM AS HE CALLS IT A NORTHERN INDRAUGHT HE CERTAINLY CONCLUDED THAT IT RAN TO THE NORTHWARD INTO THE ST GEORGES OR IRISH CHAN NEL BRUSHING THE WEST SIDE OF USHANT AND THE LANDS END AND THE EFFECT OF THE CURRENT ON HIS SHIP WAS NO DOUBT SUCH AS TO WARRANT THAT BELIEF WITH THOSE WHOSE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT WAS CONFINED TO THE MERE EFFECT OF SETTING THEM TO THE NORTHWARD OF SCILLY AND INTO THE MOUTH OF THE BRISTOL CHANNEL THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT EVEN  PERHAPS THIRTY TO THIRTYFIVE LEAGUES TO THE WEST OF USBANT AND IN ABOUT LOO FATHOMS 19OPREVAILS TO THE WESTWARD OF THE SCILLY ISLANDS TERMINATE IN THE MERE FACTS OF THE EXISTENCE AND FORCE OF THE CURRENT THE COMMANDER OF THE WEST INDIA SHIP IS SAID TO HAVE MADE MANY VOYAGES TO AND FROM THAT QUARTER AND HIS NARRATIVE SHOWS HIM TO HAVE BEEN AN OBSERVANT MAN YET HE WAS IGNORANT OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A CURRENT UNTIL THE CASE OCCURRED WHICH HAS BEEN JUST STATED THIS THEN ALONE MAY SERVE TO SHOW VERY SATISFACTORILY THAT THE CURRENT DOES NOT EXIST IN STRENGTH BUT AT CERTAIN INTERVALS AND THEREFORE OPERATES IN A MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE A TREACHEROUS MANNER HAD IT CONSTANTLY PREVAILED LIKE THAT ROUND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE C IT COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION AND IN CONSEQUENCE FEW OR NO EVILS WOULD HAVE ENSUED BUT THESE EFFECTS BEING ONLY FELT CASUALLY THEY WERE CONSIDERED AS MERE CONTINGENCIES ARISING FROM WIND AND WEATHER AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE SEA AND NOT AS RESULTING FROM A FIXED CAUSE ALWAYS OPERATING ALTHOUGH IN VERY DIFFERENT DEGREES SINCE NO PERSON AT THAT TIME HAD COLLECTED THE DIFFERENT CASES WITH A VIEW TO EXAMINE AND TO COMPARE THEM SOME INDEED RE FERRED IT TO THE INDRAUGHT OF THE BRISTOL CHANNEL WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT IF SUCH A POWER EXISTED AT ALL IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE HOW IT COULD BE SUSPENDED AND WHY IT SHOULD NOT OPERATE AT ALL TIMES OUR NAVIGATORS IN EARLIER TIMES APPEAR TO HAVE ENTERED THE BRITISH CHANNEL ON A MORE SOUTHERLY PARALLEL THAN THEY HAVE DONE IN LATTER TIMES FOR ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IGNORANT OF THE REAL CAUSE OF THE DISTURBANCE IN THEIR COURSE YET MANY OF THEM BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS AN IZDRAUGHT AS THEY CALLED IT INTO THE ST GEORGESS CHANNEL SO THAT ONE EFFECT OF THE CURRENT THAT IS THE NORTHERN SET HAD NOT PASSED UNOBSERVED ALTHOUGH THE CAUSE WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD NOR OF 1GI192 FARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN COURSE COULD IT BE KNOWN WHEN TO EXPECT IT BUT I HAVE ALSO HEARD IT REMARKED BY SEA OFFICERS AS LONG AGO AS I CAN RE MEMBER THAT  IT WAS UNACCOUNTABLE WHAT SHOULD OCCASION THEIR RUNNING DOWN SO MUCH DISTANCE IN COMING IN WITH THE LAND FROM THE WESTWARD I NEVER HEARD HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS ANY SUSPICION OF A CURRENT SETTING TO THE WESTWARD THE IDEA OF A NORTHERN INDRAUGHT INTO ST GEORGES CHANNEL BUT WHICH APPLIES EQUALLY TO THE CURRENT WEST OF SCILLY IS CLEARLY SET FORTH IN A PUBLICATION BY CAPTAIN JOSEPH MEAD IN 1757 BUT WHICH ONLY CAME TO MY KNOWLEDGE VERY LATELY BY THE FAVOUR OF MR PURDY TO WHOM I STAND INDEBTED ALSO FOR THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPORTANT FACT OF THE SET OF FORTYSIX MILES DURING THE CALM IN THE CHOPS OF THE CHANNEL CAPTAIN MEAD FIRST RELATES THE CASE OF THE SHIP HOPE OF LIVERPOOL BOUND FROM THE COAST OF GUINEA TO THAT PORT IN NOVEMBER 1735 PREFACE PAGE III HAVING HAD A GOOD OBSERVATION BY WHICH THEY FOUND THEY HAD THE IRISH CHANNEL OPEN THE WIND CONTINUED TO BLOW STRONG FROM BETWEEN THE SOUTH AND WEST BUT MOSTLY  FROM THE FORMER HAVING NO OTHER OBSERVATION IOF LATI TUDE FOR SIX DAYS IN WHICH TIME THEY CARRIED SAIL CON STANTLY THEY BY RECKONING EXPECTED TO FALL IN WITH CAPE CLEAR BUT IN THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THEY FELL IN WITH THE BLASQUETS THESE ISLANDS AND ROCKS ARE SITUATED IN LAT 5O IO OR ABOUT FORTYEIGHT MILES TO THE NORTH AND ONE DE GREE OF LONGITUDE TO THE WESTWARD OF CAPE CLEAR AGAIN PAGE IO HE SAYS THAT THE BRISTOL MERCHANT SHIPS WHICH FALL IN WITH CAPE CLEAR ON THEIR HOMEWARD PASSAGE CFROM THE WEST INDIES CJ SHAPE THEIR COURSE FROM THENCE WITH A LARGE WIND TO LTE HIGH LAND NEAR PADSTOW WHICH ISPREVAILS TO THE WESTWARD OF THE SCILLY ISLANDS 198 THE LAND THEY CHOOSE TO MAKE TO LEAD THEM TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE BRISTOL CHANNEL THAT IN ESTIMATING THIS COURSE THEY ALLOWED FOUR OR FIVE DEGREES IN THE BEARING TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INDRAUGHT INTO ST GEORGES CHANNEL THIS ANGLE WOULD GIVE ABOUT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN NAUTIC MILES AND IS PROBABLY WHAT THEY FOUND BY EXPERIENCE TO BE THE GENERAL AMOUNT OF THE NORTHERN SET HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT IN LIKE MANNER THE SAFETY OF SHIPS AFTER THEY COME INTO SOUNDINGS TILL THEY REACH SCILLY DEPENDED ON THEIR MAKING NO LESS ALLOWANCE THAN THE BRISTOL MEN DO IN THE OTHER CHANNEL FOR SAYS HE EXPERIENCE INFORMS ME THAT FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF SOUNDINGS IN  LAT 49  ON TO THE LENGTH OF SCILLY INFAIR WEATHER I HAD FOUND THE NORTHERN INDRAUGHT TO BE SIX OR EIGHT MILES IN THE TWENTYFOUR HOURS HERE THEN THE FACT OF THE NORTHERN SET IS A SECOND TIME RECOGNISED THOUGH WITHOUT ANY SUSPICION ANY MORE THAN BEFORE OF THERE BEING A WESTERLY SET ALSO HERE IT MAY BE PROPER TO STATE WHAT APPEARS TO ME TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT FACT ALTHOUGH PERHAPS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE CURRENT IN QUESTION BUT MATERIALLY AFFECTING THE SAFETY OF THE NAVIGATION BETWEEN THE BRITISH CHANNEL AND DUBLIN IT WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE AUTHOR BY CAPTAIN EVANS A GENTLEMAN WHO SUPERINTENDS THE HARBOUR WORKS AT HOLY HEAD AND WHO HAS HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE IN THE NAVIGATIOIN OF THE IRISH SEA  ALTHOUGH THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN AT THAT DAY THE TRUE LATITUDE OF CAPE CLEAR YET IT MAY REASONABLY BE SUPPOSED THAT THEY KNEW THE QUANTITY OF THE DIFFERENCE OF LATITUDE BETWEEN CAPE CLEAR AND THE HIGH LAND OF PADSTOW AS IT WAS SO NECES SARY TO THEIR PURPOSE AND SO EASY TO BE OBTAINED MDCCCXV C CFARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN ALL NAVIGATORS SAYS HE IN THEIR VOYAGE FROM THE LANDS END TO DUBLIN FIND THEMSELVES MORE OR LESS CARRIED TO THE EAST WARD WHILST RUNNING UP ST GEORGES CHANNEL WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF SO MANY VESSELS FINDING THEMSELVES IN CARDIGAN BAY WHERE IN TEMPESTUOUS WEATHER AND WESTERLY WINDS MANY HAVE BEEN LOST AND THIS HE JUSTLY SUPPOSES TO BE OCCASIONED BY A CURRENT SETTING TO THE NORTHEASTWARD IF THE STREAM WHICH OCCASIONS THIS DISTURBANCE IN THE REC KONINGS OF VESSELS HERE BE A PORTION OF THE SCILLY CURRENT IT CANNOT WELL HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN BY THE EASTERN PART OF THAT CURRENT FALLING ON THE IRISH COAST TO THE EAST OF CAPE CLEAR AND BEING THENCE DIVERTED TO THE NORTHEAST ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF IRELAND THIS MAY CERTAINLY HAPPEN AND MAY FORM A PART OF THE CAUSE BUT I CONCLUDE THAT THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE CAUSE IS A CURRENT GENERATED ON THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF IRELAND BY THE PREVALENCY OF SOUTHWEST AND WSW WINDS TO WHICH THE POSITION OF THE COAST BETWEEN CAPE CLEAR AND CARNSORE POINT SEEMS PARTI CULARLY ADAPTED THIS EFFECT FROM WHATSOEVER CAUSE IT MAY ARISE OUGHT TO BE GENERALLY KNOWN AS IT MAY PRODUCE GREAT INCONVENIENCE AND DISTRESS TO THOSE WHO FOR THE FIRST TIME MAKE USE OF THAT NAVIGATION AND ESPECIALLY TO SUCH VESSELS AS ARE EITHER NOT CALCULATED OR NOT IN A STATE TO BEAT OFF A LEESHORE FOR THE RECESSES OF THE CARDIGAN BAY ARE DEEP AND WITHOUT SHELTER IT MAY BE CONCEIVED THAT A CURRENT SO GENERATED ON THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF IRELAND AND POSSIBLY AUGMENTED BY A PORTION OF THE STREAM FROM THE BAY WOULD SHOOT OFF TO THE NORTHEASTWARD POINTING TOWARDS THE BAY OF CARDIGAN AS IT 194PREVAILS TO THE WESTWARD OF THE SCILLY ISLANDS CANIOT TURN SHORT ROUND SO ACUTE A POINT AS THAT FORMED BY THE CAPE OF CARNSORE SUCH BEING THE NATURE OF ALL CURRENTS WHE THER OF WATER OR OF AIR AND VESSELS WILL BE CARRIED TO THE NORTHEASTWARD ACCORDINGLY WHILST THEY CONTINUE IN THE STREAM OF THE CURRENT THE SOUTHERLY CURRENT WHICH PASSES BY DUBLIN ENTERS PROBABLY INTO AND MERGES IN THE STRENFT IN QUESTION AS THE SAME KIND OF CURRENT ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF ENGLAND FALLS INTO THAT WHICH PASSES THE STRAIT OF DOVER AND AFTERWARDS RUNS ALONG THE COASTS OF FLANDERS HOLLAND C THE USE OF BEING WELL INFORMED CONCERNING THESE PARTIAL CURRENTS IN NARROW SEAS IS OBVIOUS SINCE THE WANT OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY IN A MOMENT BE FATAL TO A SHIP AND HER WHOLE CREW THIS CANNOT BE MORE STRONGLY ENFORCED THAN BY CALLING TO MIND THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A FRIGATE WAS LOST WITH HER CREW DURING THE WAR JUST TERMINATED SHE SAILED EITHER FROM THE DOWNS OR THE THAMES TO THE HELDER AND RAN IN THE NIGHT UNDER FULL SAIL ON ONE OF THE SHOALS LYING BEFORE IT HAD THE COMMANDER KNOWN THAT THERE IS A GENERAL SET OR CURRENT FROM THE STRAIT OF DOVER I E AT THE BACK OF THE GOODWIN SAND ALONG THE COAST OF FLANDERS HOLLAND JUTLAND C AND WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE EQUAL TO TWENTYFIVE MILES ON AN ORDINARY PASSAGE TO THE TEXEL HE WOULD NOT HAVE RUN ON DURINGTHE NIGHT OR AT LEAST WITH OUT THE PRECAUTION OF SOUNDING AGAIN THE BRITANNIA INDIA SHIP IN 1809 WAS LOST ON THE BACK OF THE GOODWIN SAND PROBABLY THROUGH IGNORANCE OF THE ACCELERATION OF THE SAME CURRENT DURING A VIOLENT GALE AT WEST OR SOUTHWEST A PILOT WOULD BE RECKONED DEFICIENT WHO DID NOT KNOW THE DIRECTION AND FORCE OF THE SEVERAL STREAMS OF TIDE AT ALL SEASONS WITHIN HIS PROVINCE THERE CC 95SFARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN IS A CURRENT GENERALLY IF NOT CONSTANTLY RUNNING UP THE BRI TISH CHANNEL THAT IS THE EASTERN TIDES ARE THE STRONGEST AND IN STORMY WEATHER FROM THE WEST RUN LONGER THAN THE WESTERN OR EBB TIDES AT THE SAME TIME THE LEVEL OF THE CHANNEL IS RAISED TWO FEET OR MORE ABOVE THAT OF THE NORTH SEA AND CONSEQUENTLY THE FORMER WILL DISCHARGE PLENTIFULLY INTO THE LATTER HERE THEN IS AN ACCELERATION OF THE CURRENT AND WHICI MEN WHO HAVE THE CHARGE OF PILOTING OF SHIPS OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN AND WHO CAN BE IGNORANT OF THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE CHANNEL WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THE PORTS IN THE CHANNEL ARE SOME FEET DEEPER IN STRONG WESTERLY WINDS THAN AT ORDINARY TIMES  ALTHOUGH THE FOLLOWING REMARKS DO NOT APPLY TO THE SCILLY OR THWART CURRENT YET AS RELATING TO CURRENTS THAT AT ALL TIMES AFFECT THE NAVIGATION AROUND THE BRITISH ISLANDS IT IS HOPED THAT THE UTILITY OF INSERTING THEM MAY ATONE FOR THEIR BEING OUT OF PLACE IT IS PROPER TO STATE THAT THE FACTS HERE SET FORTH ARE ASSUMED ON THE GROUND OF DETACHED NOTICES AND NOT FROM A CONNECTED CHAIN OF OBSERVATION INDEED IT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN EX PECTED AND IT IS ALSO PROPER TO BE STATED THAT THE CURRENTS HERE INTENDED ONLY FORM A PORTION OF THE ORDINARY STREAM OF TIDE ALONG THE COAST AND IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DEGREES OF VELOCITY OF THE OPPOSITE STREAMS ON THE SAME COAST THAT CONSTITUTES THE CURRENT IN QUESTION AS INDEED IT CANNOT BE MANIFESTED IN ANY OTHER WAY AN INSTANCE HAS JUST BEEN GIVEN IN THE BRITISH CHANNEL WHERE RIVERS FORM ANY QUANTITY OF ALLUVIAL GROUND AT THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE SEA THERE MOST INFALLIBLY THE DIRECTION OF THE 196PREVAILS TO THE WESTWARD OF THE SCILLY ISLANDS 197 SEA CURRENT WILL BE SHOWN BY THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ALLUVIAL GROUND  OR BY THE SAND OR MUD BANKS CONTIGUOUS TO IT IN THE SEA THE PROCESS IS EXPLAINED IN A NOTE AND THOSE TO WHOM I MAY NOT HAVE RENDERED MYSELF INTELLIGIBLE MAY EASILY SATISFY THEMSELVES BY OBSERVING THE JUNCTION OF ANY TWO STREAMS THAT ARE VERY MUCH DISPROPORTIONED TO EACH OTHER IN POINT OF BULK AND IN WHICH NO ART HAS BEEN EMPLOYED TO COUN TERACT THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS  THE POINT OF JUNCTION OF TWO RIVERS OR OF A RIVER WITH THE SEA PROVIDED THAT THE SEA HAS A PREDOMINANT STREAM OF CURRENT WILL ALWAYS FORM AN ACUTE ANGLE IF THE SOIL THROUGH WHICH THEY RUN HE NOT OF A TEXTURE FIRM ENOUGH TO RESIST THE CORRODING POWER OF THE STREAM BUT COMPOSED OF ALLUVIAL MATTER DEPOSITED BY ONE OR BOTH OF THE WATERS AS IS ORDINARILY THE CASE THIS POINT OF JUNCTION MAY BE EITHERFIRM ALLUVIAL LAND OR A BANK OF SAND OR MUD UNDER WATER AS THE CASE MAY HAPPEN AND FINALLY THE ACUTE ANGLE OF JUNCTION WILL ALWAYS POINT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STREAM OF THE RECIPIENT WATER BE IT A RIVER OR THE SEA THE REASON OF THIS IS THAT TWO STREAMS AT THEIR CONFLUENCE HAVE A NATURAL TEN DENCY TO SLIDE INTO EACH OTHER AS THE EASIEST MODE OF EFFECTING THEIR JUNCTION AND WERE THEY EITHER BY REASON OF THE NATURAL SOLIDITY OF THEIR BANKS OR BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS COMPELLED TO JOIN AT RIGHT ANGLES OR AT A VERY LARGE ANGLE THE MEETING OF THEIR WATERS IN A CASE WHERE THEY LHAD ANY DEGREE OF RAPIDITY WOULD PRODUCE AN AGITATION THAT WOULD PROVE INJURIOUS TO THEIR BANKS AND INCONVENIENT TO THE NAVIGATION FOR THE SAKE OF ILLUSTRATION LET IT BE SUPPOSED THAT A SMALL RIVER IS CONDUCTED ARTI FICIALLY INTO A LARGER ONE OR INTO A SEA WHICH HAS A CURRENT ALONG SHORE THROUGH A CUT MADE THROUGH THE ALLUVIAL SOIL AND THE ANGLE OF JUNCTION TO BE VERY LARGE OR AP PROACHING TO A RIGHT ANGLE AND WITHOUT ANY ARTIFICIAL AID TO KEEP IT IN THAT STATE THE FOLLOWING TRAIN OF CONSEQUENCES WOULD ENSUE IT IS TO BE SUPPOSED OF COURSE THAT THE RECIPIENT RIVER HAD ITS BED PREVIOUSLY ENLARGED TO RECEIVE THE OTHER IN ORDER TO PREVENT FLOODS THE FIRST EFFECT WOULD BE THAT THE HEAD OF THE ADJUNCT RIVER ENTERING WITH AN ALMOST PERPENDICULAR COURSE INTO THAT OF THE RECIPIENT WOULD MEET WITH SO MUCH RE SISTANCE FROM IT THAT IT WOULD BE PARTLY BEATEN BACK AND COMPELLED TO SEEK ITS WAY ALONG THE BANK OF THE RECIPIENT RIVER THIS BEND IN ITS COURSE WOULD IPDUCE SUCH  PRESSURE ON THE BANK AT THE LOWER ANGLE OF JUNCTION AS WOULD SOON WEAR IT AWAY AND AN OBLIQUE COURSE OF APPROACH OF THE WHOLE BODY OF THE ADJUNCT STREAM198 FARTHER OBSERVATIOS ON THE CURRENT THAT OFTEN IN EFFECT THE EMBOUCHURES OF RIVERS SITUATED IN ALLUVIAL GROUND ALWAYS POINT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STREAM OF THE SEA CURRENT THE SAND MUD OR GRAVEL BANKS FORMED BY THE SAME CURRENT LIEIN THE SAME DIRECTION AND WITH THEIR NARROWEST OR SHARPEST POINT DOWNWARDS IN MANY PLACES ALONG THE COAST WATER COURSES ARE FOUND TO TERMINATE IN LONG NARROW LAKES WITH NARROW SANDY TRACTS BETWEEN THEM AND THE SEA THROUGH WHICH THE WATER STILL OOZES THOUGH ALL APPEARS TO BE STAGNANT THESE ALSO HAVE BEEN FORMED BY THE SEA CURRENTS AND POINT THE SAME WAY ORIGINALLY THESE WATERCOURSES OR RIVERS GAINED THE SEA NEAR THE PLACE WHERE THE HEAD OF THE LAKE NOW IS BUT THE SEA CURRENT FORMING SANDY ALLUVION ALONG THAT PART OF THE COAST THE RIVER KEPT ITS COURSE WITHIN IT ALONG THE FORMER SEA SHORE WOULD COMMENCE IN THE MEAN TIME A TRIANGULAR SPACE OF STILL WATER WOULD BE FORMED BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL UPPER ANGLE OF JUNCTION AND THE NEW ONE OCCASIONED BY THE OBLIQUITY OF COURSE AND THIS STILL WATER AS IS ITS NATURE WOULD LET DROP THE MUD AND SAND WHICH IT HAD HELD SUSPENDED WHILST IN MOTION AND THUS BEGIN TO FORM A TRIANGULAR BANK OF THE SAME SHAPE AND EXTENT HERE THEN THE OPERATION IS COMMENCED IN ALL ITS PARTS AND THE TRIANGULAR BANK BY ITS BEING CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE WILL FORCE THE ADJUNCT STREAM TO BORROW STILL MORE AND MORE ON ITS OPPOSITE BANK WHICH WILL GRADUALLY WEAR AWAY UNTIL THE ANGLE OF JUNCTION OF THE TWO WATERS BECOMES SO ACUTE THAT THE ADJUNCT STREAM NO LONGER MEETS WITH ANY RESISTANCE FROM THAT OF THE RECIPIENT BUT MAY BE SAID TO SLIDE INTO CONTACT WITH IT THIS THEN IS THE NATURAL STATE OF THE JUNCTION OF STREAMS BUT AFTER ALL THE POINT OFJUNCTION WILL ALTHOUGH ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY MOVE DOWNWARDS BECAUSE THE TRIANGULAR BANK MUST CONTINUE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONS IF LEFT TO ITSELF MEAN TIME TLHE BODY OF IT RISES BY THE CONTINUAL DEPOSITIONS ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND BE COMES FIRM ALLUVIAL LAND ITS APEX BEING THE POINT OF JUNCTION OF THE TWO WATERS AND ITS DIRECTION OF COURSE THE SAME WITH THAT OF THE STREAM OF THE RECIPIENT WATER WHEN TWO STREAMS THAT ARE NEARLY EQUAL TO EACH OTHER IN RESPECT OF BULK AND OF VELOCITY JOIN EACH OF THEM AS IT WERE ASSERTS

DERANCE OF THE STREAM IS NORTHWARDS  THAT IT TURNS ROUND THE NORTH END OF THE ISLAND OR AT LEAST A PART OF IT DOES AND THENCE SOUTHWARD ALONG THE EASTERN COAST PROBABLY THE WHOLE WAY TO CARNSORE POINT BUT CERTAINLY PAST DUBLIN THE EFFECT OF A SOUTHERLY CURRENT OR PREVAILING SOUTLHERLY TIDE OVER THE NORTHERN IS VISIBLE IN THE PRESENT OUTFALL OF THE LIFFEY AND STILL MORE IN THE TRACES OF THE FORMER ONE PRE VIOUS TO THE ERECTION OF THE LONG WALL BOTH HAVING AN INCLI NATION TO THE SOUTH AND POSSIBLY THE DIRECTION OF THE WALL HAS ITSELF OCCASIONED A PART OF THE PRESENT DIFFICULTY ARISING ON THE MATTER OF THE PILOTAGE AND HERE I BEG LEAVE ONCE MORE TO QUOTE CAPTAIN MEAD WHO SPEAKING FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE SAYS PAGE 1 I ON THE  WESTERN COAST OF IRELAND OFF THE SHELLOCKS QU SKELLIGS  THE NORTHERN INDRAUGHT WAS NOT LESS THAN FOUR LEAGUES IN TWENTYFOUR HOURS EVEN IN MODERATE GALES ALSO OFF THE  WESTERN COAST OF LEWIS ISLAND I FIND IT STRONGER THAN IN  SOUNDINGS THAT IS MORE THAN SIX OR EIGHT MILES IN THE TWENTYFOUR HOURS AND ALSO OFF FOUL ISLAND SHETLAND SOMETHING WEAKER THAN THE LATTER ALONG THE SOUTHEASTERN COAST FROM THE MIZEN HEAD AND  ARTICLES OF VARIOUS KINDS KNOWN TO HAVE COME FROM THE SOUTHWARD AND SOUTH EAST ARE CONTINUALLY CASTING UP IN GALWAY BAYPREVAILS TO THE WESTWARD OF THE SILLY ISLANDS 201 CAPE CLEAR TO CARNSORE POINT THE AUTHOR IS LESS INFORMED IN RESPECT OF NOTICES FROM OTHERS THAN CONCERNING ANY OTHER PART OF THE COAST BUT HAVING VISITED IT REPEATEDLY AND CON SIDERED ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES BELONGING TO IT HE IS FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT THERE IS A NORTHEASTERLY CURRENT AND THAT IT IS THIS STREAM PROLONGED FROM CARNS9RE POINT THAT CARRIES VES SELS TO THE EASTWARD OF THEIR COURSE IN THEIR WAY UP THE IRISH SEA SEE ABOVE PAGE 194 THE SAME KIND OF NORTHERLY STREAM AND OCCASIONED PRO BABLY BY THE SAME CAUSE IS PRODUCED ON THE WESTERN COAST OF SCOTLAND FROM WHENCE IT TURNS ROUND THE NORTH END OF THE ISLAND AND THENCE SOUTHWARD ALONG ITS EASTERN SIDE AS FAR AS HARWICH WHERE IT FALLS INTO THE STRAIT OF DOVER OR CHANNEL CURRENT WHICH COMES UP AT THE BACK OF THE GOODWIN SAND THE CHANNEL CURRENT HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED PAGE 196 AND CAN HARDLY BE QUESTIONED AS TO ITS EXISTENCE WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ALREADY SET FORTH ARE CONSIDERED SUCH AS THE ELEVATION OF THE LEVEL OF THE CHANNEL AT TIMES BY TWO FEET OR MORE THE LONGER CONTINUANCE OF THE EASTERN STREAM OF TIDE THAN THE WESTERN TOGETHER WITH THE STREAM THAT RUNS TO THE NORTH EAST FROM THE STRAIT OF DOVER ALONG THE WHOLE COAST OF FLANDERS HOLLANDAND JUTLAND AND WHICH AFFORDING AS IS SAID A HELP OF TWENTYFIVE MILES ORDINARILY BETWEEN THE THAMES AND THE TEXEL A RUN OF ONLY 16O MILES OR LESS CANNOT BUT BE REFERRED IN PART TO THE CHANNEL OR DOVER CURRENT FOR MORE PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE CURRENT AT THE STRAIT OF DOVER C THE READER IS REFERRED TO VOL XVIITH NEW SERIES OF THE SOCIETYS TRANSACTIONS AT THE MOUTH OF THE BALTIC SEA THE JUTLAND CURRENT IS JOINED BY THE OUTFALL OF THE FORMER WHICH AT ALL TIMES RECEIVES MORE MDCCCXV D DO2 FIFARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT C WATER THAN IT CAN EVAPORATE THE COLLECTIVE STREAM THEN PROCEEDS ALONG THE COAST OF NORWAY CONTINUING ITS NORTHERLY COURSE OFF THE NAZE ITIS KNOWN TO RUN TWO MILES PER HOUR SUCH IS THE GENERAL COURSE OF THE STREAM OF CURRENT AROUND THESE ISLANDS THERE ARE HOWEVER MANY PARTICULAR EXCEPTIONS TO BE MADE AS HAPPENS IN THE CASE OF TIDES WHERE A DEEP RECESS IN THE COAST OFTEN DISTURBS THE UNIFORMITY OF THE GENERAL COURSE OF THE STREAMICHART OF THE FR41ICS OF THE 1IEC TOR ANAD ATLAS EJS T II

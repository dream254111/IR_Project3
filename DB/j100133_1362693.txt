SWARTH TITH MAP AND FIGURES Contribution from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology of the University of California T HE RECENT acquisition by the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology of series of Brown Towhees Pipilo crissalis from sections not previously repre sented in the collection notably from many points in the Sierra Nevada suggested the desirability of an examination of the entire group The revision of the ranges of the three recognized subspecies as here set forth is based mainly upon the collection of the California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology to gether with the Grinnell Morcom and Swarth collections deposited in that institution In addition the writer is indebted for the use of specimens from Oregon loaned by the University of Oregon Museum through the courtesy of Dr John F Bovard and for the privilege of examining the extensive series of these birds in the collection of J and J W Mailliard including many speci niens from critical points not represented in the collection of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology Altogether 383 specimens were used in this study The Brown Towhee is one of several species of birds characterizing the Sono ran zones in California that are so closely restricted in their range as hardly to extend beyond the confines of the state While the Brown Towhee Pipilo cris salis of California is obviously similar to the Cafion Towhee Pipilo fuscus of the southern Rocky Mountain region the two being doubtless but recently de rived from a common ancestry the wide hiatus now existing between their ranges together with the lack of intergradation between them is sufficient justification for their being regarded as distinct species Indeed the point is worth empha sizing that while the range of Pipilo crissalis is comparable to the ranges of cer tain other Pacific Coast species such as Psaltriparus minimus Aphelocoma cali fornica and the west Californian races of Pipilo maculatus all with related forms in the Rocky Mountain region comparable to Pipilo fuscus the Brown Towhee has no representative race in eastern California such as is possessed by each of the other bird species cited It seems remarkable that no towhees of this group should exist on the east slope of the Sierras and in the Upper Sonoran zone of the desert mountains The California Brown Towhee was first made known to science through the description by Vigors of Fringilla crissalis Zool Voy Blossom 1839 p 19 His type specimen is listed in the collection of the British Museum as from Mon terey Sharpe Cat Birds Brit Mus xii 1888 p 754 Birds from the vicinity of Monterey belong to the reddishcolored race of the central coast region of Cali fornia though they do not show the extreme manifestation of the characters of that subspecies and as there is no question of the migration of individuals to cause confusion for the Brown Towhees are nonmigratory the name crissalis applied to a specimen from this region must of course be used for the central coast race The species long regarded as a subspecies of Pipilo fuscus was not further divided until the description by Anthony Auk xii 1895 p 111 of Pipilo fuscus senicala from San Fernando Lower California In 1899 McGregor Bull Coo118 THE CONDOR Vol XX per Orn Club I 1899 p 11 described Pipilo fuscus carolae from Battle Creek near Balls Ferry Shasta County California This subspecies was accepted by the A O U

distinguished the general tone of crissalis being reddish and of carolae gray while senicula is appreciably darker than the other two Senicula is fur ther distinguished by its small size and short stubby bill Color differences be tween the races are somewhat obscured in worn and faded plumage of course but even in such cases they can usually be separated without difficulty This statement naturally does not apply to specimens from intermediate localities in which intergradation between races occurs Pipilo crissalis crissalis Vigors California Brown Towhee Type localityMonterey

Distinguishing charactersThe generally reddish coloration serves to distinguish Pipilo crissalis crissalis from either of the other two related subspecies In measure ments P c crissalis in its typical form is close to P c carolae Where the range of P c senicula is approached there is a diminution in size so that in this sense crissalis may oe said to be intermediate in measurements between carolae and senicula RemarksBrown Towhees from the general vicinity of Monterey the type locality of Fringilla crissalis by no means exhibit the extreme differentiation of the peculiar characteristics of the coast race The bright reddish coloration of this subspecies the outstanding feature of the race is farthest developed in birds from immediately north and south of San Francisco Bay as shown by specimens from Sonoma Marin and Santa Clara counties Between this extreme and that of the slaty hue of the birds from San Diego County there is a nicely graded se ries of steps changes in hue corresponding closely with the geographical position of the specimens examined Changes in measurements take place similarly A series of skins from Paicines and Mulberry San Benito County about at the boundary line I have indicated between the ranges of P c crissalis and P c carolae are intermediate in character between these two races I have referred these birds to the subspecies crissalis which they most nearly resemble but in their indeterminate appearance they are closely similar to other intermediates from San Luis Obispo County between crissalis and senicula Material at hand from Humboldt and Mendocino counties is limited in quan tity and unsatisfactory for subspecific discrimination the specimens being all young birds or else faded and molting adults However they appear to be all referable to P c crissalis though again less reddish colored than San Francisco Bay specimens possibly they all exemplify varying stages of intermediateness toward P c carolae Pipilo crissalis

race Anthony Auk xii 1895 p 110 in a discussion of the brown tow hees remarks on the less rufescent col oration of birds from Butte and Cala veras counties as compared with typi cal crissalis and on the pallor of a spe cimen from the south fork of the Kern River The coloration of the latter bird however should not be considered as indicative of intergradation toward Pipilo fuscus mesoleucus the possibility of which was suggested for individuals from that region grayish colored even in fresh plumage are especially subject to fading from the fierce sunlight to which they are exposed as shown by additional specimens from the same sec tion There are no skins at hand showing intergradation between carolae and seni cula Specimens from the southern extremity of the Sierra Nevada birds geo graphically nearest to the southern California race show as wide divergence from the latter as do those from Oregon The floor of the San Joaquin Valley is niot suited to the needs of the Brown Towhee and the species is absent from most of this region but one specimen at hand taken at a point twentytwo miles south of Los Bafios Merced County at the east base of the Mount Diablo range though showing

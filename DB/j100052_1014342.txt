pleasure and considerable legislation was put in force through the use of these powers during his admin istration New educational agrarian banking mining petroleum and tariff laws have been passed or are in process of legislation and these developments should be closely watched by Ameri cans in order that they may keep in formed as to what legislation may interfere with or expedite the flow of business Protective tariff legislation in particular is of the greatest interest to the American exporter At the present moment labor in Mexico is rather unsettled but it is comparatively cheap and the number of articles that can be manufactured in Mexico in competition with American products is very great The United States can not compete with the native manufactures of such articles as the cheaper grades of textiles The large variety of fruits and vegetables raised in Mexico will permit the establish ment of more important canning indus tries There are now saddle and leather manufactures sugar refineries tobacco factories factories for making soap gold and silver ornaments soft drinks wearing apparel and numerous other things of less importance As these industries increase in output so that the home markets can be conveniently supplied import tariffs will be estab lished to prevent foreign competition Such legislation may inconvenience in dividual exporters but it is difficult to conceive of any legislation or other obstacle that can prevent increase in exports from the United States to Mexico Between 1909 and 1919 the value of exports increased from 49 793323 to 131455101 or 160 per cent in spite of revolutions the world war and other unfavorable factors It is safe to predict that during the next decade the increase will be much larger in spite of declining valuations of declared exports The Present Outlook for United States Trade with Germany By J ANTON DE HAAS PHD Professor of Foreign Trade Graduate School of Business Administration New York University TRADE does not develop naturally between two countries technic ally in a state of war The War Trade Board ruling 814 was amended on July 8 1920 so as to allow all persons in the United States on or after July 8 1920 to trade and communicate with all persons with whom trade and com munication are prohibited by the Trad ing with the Enemy Act but the legal status of contracts between Amer ican and German citizens and the de gree of protection which their property would enjoy are subject to much un certainty Germany from her side has in many ways facilitated American busi ness No forced liquidation of Amer ican firms has taken place during the war and the law of April 21 1920 provides for the reinstatement of for eign patents and announces that the period from August 1 1914 to July 31 1919 will not be counted as part of the legal duration The fact that through our failure to ratify the Treaty of Versailles we forfeited the benefits as sured under 297 with the result that American firms in Germany are now subject to the payment of the Reichs notopfer is embarrassing to those firms but does not seriously interfere 80THE PRESENT OUTLOOK FOR UNITED STATES TRADE with trade An effective channel of trade information has been reestab lished through the American Associa tion of Commerce and Trade of Berlin which recently has opened offices in New York under the name The Amer ican Chamber of Commerce of Berlin and whose official organ Transatlantic Trade is devoted to GermanAmerican trade information Whether a rapid revival of trade can be expected after peace is finally de clared and whether this trade will hold out large benefits to American indus try are questions which can only be tentatively answered after a considera tion of the principal factors involved Germanys unfavorable commodity balance of some 100000000 in 1913 is largely accounted for by the income of the German merchant marine which at that time represented approxi mately 10 per cent of the total world tonnage and by the income of foreign investments The reduction of the merchant marine to 300000 gross tons the loss of the colonies the liquidation of oversea investments the confisca tion of trademarks and patents and the destruction of marketing organiza tions have cut into the means formerly available to Germany for the payment of its imports German imports must in the future to a larger degree than before the war be paid for by exports The higher the payment exacted under the terms of the Peace Treaty and the lower the price at which commodities will be accepted in liquidation of the debts the greater the flood of com modities from Germany must be RAW MATERIAL IMPORTS Territorial losses will compel Ger many to import a larger share of its raw material In order to maintain its iron industry on the same basis as in 1913 assuming that the building of new factories will equalize the loss of 7 the AlsaceLorraine and Silesia plants Germany will now be obliged to im port at least 35000000 tons of ore yearly as compared with 14000000 tons before the war The reduction in population resulting from territorial and war losses would under normal conditions have meant a decrease in the import of foodstuffs The falling off of domestic production resulting from war neglect lack of fertilizer and diminished labor efficiency combined with territorial losses make Germany at present more than ever dependent upon the outside world The amount which Germany must import in raw material and foodstuffs in order to reestablish a normal eco nomic life is still further increased by the total exhaustion of all reserve stocks Economically Germany is living a handtomouth existence and it can not return to a normal economic life until the stocks necessary to give in dustry and commerce stability have been replenished and the machinery of industry and transportation has been restored to its full productive capacity The American business man must therefore realize that the country which has always been represented to him as his most dangerous trade rival is now placed in the position where its former enemies exert themselves to force it to increase its exports of manu factured goods and to restrict its im ports to necessary raw materials Only through a rigid and unrelaxed control of imports and exports can Germany hope to meet the present emergency This necessity of govern ment control though denied by many interests in Germany for reasons not difficult to fathom becomes the more urgent on account of the depreciation of the mark If Germany were to per mit the laissezfaire principle to oper ate as she saw it operate in 1919 she would very soon be depleted of the 81THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY goods which form the only means of payment for the imports she needs so badly In those days it occurred that entire factories were dismantled and the machinery sold abroad because the factory could not operate on account of the lack of raw materials and be cause the machinery brought attrac tive prices in marks At present gov ernment control has become even more necessary because of the discrepancy in purchasing power between the mark held within and outside of Germany Imports of foodstuffs paid for in marks not withdrawn from domestic circula tion the flood of goods through the hole in the West which the govern ment was for a while unable to stem the flight of capital and the dis counting of Germanys obligations un der the Peace Treaty have all been responsible for this Germany now operates under a Zwangswirtschaft industry and com merce are largely placed under control of the government itself or of the strongly organized industrial associa tions operating in harmony with gov ernment purposes THE PLANWIRTSCHAFT Trade with Germany in the near fu ture will be determined largely by the Plan according to which Germany is to rise The Planwirtschaft which gradually forces industry transporta tion banking and commerce into an economic lockstep will operate ac cording to the following principles Imports should be reduced to a mini mum through the most complete utili zation of domestic resources The greatest productive capacity should be obtained through standardization The production of nonessentials should be limited A carefully workedout international price policy should re conquer the lost markets and accumu late the highest possible foreign bal ances to be used for the payment of debts and of purchases of raw mate rialsl The organization of a Planwirt schaft is much facilitiated by the very pronounced tendency on the part of all business enterprises to combine Scar city of raw materials makes vertical combination the natural method to se cure stability in supply and price The loss of branch establishments through loss of territory and forced liquidation drive the crippled organ izations into new alignments Ab sorbing already established concerns is the quickest method to secure larger productive capacity since the building of new plants is at present both time consuming and costly By acquiring larger assets subject to depreciation and especially by acquiring them at least on paper for the prevailing high prices the possibility of much en larged depreciation accounts and other secret reserves is offered as a welcome cloak with which to hide the enormous profits resulting from a rising price level The funds made available through liquidation in enemy coun tries enable the larger plants to absorb the smaller purely domestic concerns who through the depreciation of the mark and the resulting high operat ing costs are in pressing need of ac quiring more working capital The boom in the stock market makes it possible to obtain outside capital cheaply and readily The monthly new offerings on the Berlin stock exchange average more than 1000 000000 marks2 It is indeed open to question whether the general adjustment of the financial life of the concerns to the inflation of 1 See Director Lusenskys address before Deut sche Weltwirtschaftliche Gesellschaft reported in Weltwirtschaft July 1920 p 208 2See Dr Felix Pinner Sozialisierung und Vertrustung Berliner Tageblatt Nov 271920THE PRESENT OUTLOOK FOR UNITED STATES TRADE values will not in the end hamper their competitive position especially since most of the capital increases are ob tained in the form of cumulative pre ferred stock and are frequently used to purchase assets which are certain to slump in value as soon as the shortage of coal and ore has been alleviated For the present however the combina tion movement offers an easy opportu nity for the control of the develop ment of industry The desire to make the domestic re sources supply industry as far as pos sible finds practical expression in many directions It may be expected that the fuel problem will have been effectively solved within the next five years by an increasing use of lignite by technical improvements in engines and by hydroelectric developments which are now under way The econ omies resulting from these measures now taken as a matter of necessity may in the end improve the competitive position of German industry A de termined effort is made to make alu minum take the place of copper in order to do away with the necessity of importing large quantities of ore which would be needed to satisfy the copper hunger of German industry The development of the electrochemi cal industry will cut down materially the need for the importation of ni trates which before the war amounted to approximately 180000000 marks a year The Reichswirtschaftsrat has de clared itself in favor of eliminating all economically unimportant industries but it is not likely that this will be car ried into practical effect with respect to those luxury industries which pro duce also for export The wide margin between raw material costs and the price of the finished article make them 1 See Commerce Reports January 5 1920 and August 4 1920 under present circumstances ideal ex port products Probably the most significant devel opment is the increasing interest shown in the standardization of industry a movement which was initiated by the Verein Deutscher Ingenieure in May 1917 and aims to obtain greater econ omy in production by cutting down the duplicate repair stocks necessitated by individualization The direct effect of this normalization upon the world markets will be conditioned by the worlds willingness to purchase stand ardized articles On the whole costs of production are low in Germany Food coal and iron are maintained at prices below those prevailing in the world markets Wages are in most industries far below those of the other European countries A skilled workman receives approxi mately sixty marks a day or at the present rate of exchange about ninety cents Many industries more espe cially those not dependent upon im ported raw material are therefore in a position to underbid in the world mar kets In the machinery trade in alu minum and enamelware articles and in the specifically German lines such as toys and chemical products the Germans are at present underselling English and American manufacturers by as much as 50 per cent The deflation which has taken place over practically the entire world with varying violence has stimulated rather than hampered German indus try It has made possible the pur chase of raw products at more reason able prices and has offset to a large 1 See Hermann Muthesius Qualitatsarbeid und Luxusbekampfung Berliner Tageblatt Oc tober 31 1920 and

ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY degree the effects of continued inflation at home It has also induced sellers to give more liberal credit terms in order to facilitate the movement of stocks FEAR OF GERMAN DUMPING Isolated notices with respect to Ger man competition which continue to appear in consular reports and trade journals have not failed to arouse a fear for German dumping which is not entirely without foundation As long as the mark is depreciated in terms of gold as long as domestic prices do not fully express this depreciation as long as the currency of Germany is not in some way linked to a gold foundation through convertibility of the present mark or of some newcurrencyto be cre ated in the future Germany will remain a reservoir of potential dumping There are however compensating factors Two significant suggestions appear in a notice in the Board of Trade Jour nal of December 1920 one to the ef fect that practically all the articles about which there is a complaint of dumping in England do not require an export license in Germany the other indicating that the complaints refer not so much to the volume as to the skill with which the goods are placed on the market The law which at pres ent controls German exports dating from December 20 1919 requires an export license for all goods No li censes are issued unless the prices at which the goods are sold correspond closely to the market price in the coun try of destination In the case of countries of less depreciated currencies quotations in that foreign currency are usually prescribed1 The trade associations charged with the administration of this law are at 1 For a complete description of export licenses see W Pahl Die Auszenhandelskontrolle Berlin 1920 Some articles among which clocks toys and textiles are excepted present using greater care than for merly to adjust German export prices to world prices though hampered by a lack of reliable channels of informa tion The desire to create foreign bal ances and not to arouse the animosity of foreign governments which would lead to antidumping legislation such as is contemplated at present in Sweden Denmark Norway Switzer land Finland England Argentine and Japan and against which under the terms of the Peace Treaty Germany has no means of defense will induce them to use the greatest possible care1 There are other factors which also make the danger of wholesale dumping less imminent Inability to guarantee delivery and in some cases to guarantee stability of price coupled with a poor quality of workmanship and not infre quently also of material are not tradebuilding factors German labor may be cheapit is also inefficient The glass industry reports a 30 per cent production with a labor force equal to prewar standards while the German Potash Syndicate estimates the individual productivity of the workman at about 50 per cent2 The failure of German firms to abide by their contracts and the practice of the export offices to quote prices which frequently allow dealers to supply their need more cheaply through some mid dleman in another country than from the German factory direct lead many firms to prefer to buy at high prices elsewhere rather than face the risk of handling German goods3 1 See Dr Julius Wolf Valuta und Finanznot in Deutschland Stuttgart October 1920 2 See Dr W Vershofen Porzellanindustrie und Exportwirtschaft in Weltwirtschaftszeitung June 25 1920 3 See Dr Th Metz Lieferfristen Weltwirt schaftszeitung June 25 1920 also Mr Q J Terpstra Nieuwe Beroering in Onze Metaal In dustrie EconomischStatistische Berichten Jan uary 14 1920 84THE PRESENT OUTLOOK FOR UNITED STATES TRADE The lack of working capital and the increased costs of bank credit make it necessary in practically every case not only to do business on a cash basis but also to make a substantial deposit when placing an order Low prices may not prove a sufficient inducement to over come all these trade difficulties With the exception of certain raw materials and food products no goods can at present be imported into Ger many except on license American goods are now finding their way into Germany but they are almost exclu sively raw products foodstuffs and manufactured articles which may be classed as necessities In so far as im port licenses can be procured there is in Germany at present a good market for luxury articles on account of the shifting of wealth into the hands of those little accustomed to it The very circumstances which make imports difficult make Germany an attractive field for the investing of American capital The domestic mar ket is hungry for goods while low oper ating costs under proper management make Germany a natural distributing center for Europe The National Cash Register Company is now building a factory in Germany while during June 1920 the Amstea Company was organ ized in Berlin by the American Steel Export Company the Automotive Products Corporation and the Eastern European Trading Company Ger manys capital shortage is attracting also capital from Holland England France Sweden and Switzerland This Verfremdung or denationaliza tion of German industry is causing no little concern in Germany From the point of view of American industry the 1 In an article in the Berliner Tageblatt of Octo ber 19 1920 Die Verteuerung des Bankkre dits the author quotes a case in which in conse quence of the method of figuring the turnover tax on accounts current one firm was charged 52 per cent for credit accommodation investing of American capital in Ger many must be looked upon with favor The shift in capital will aid in rapidly and permanently rehabilitating and stabilizing the foreign exchange rate while avoiding the flooding of our mar ket with German goods THE VEREDLUNGSVERKEHR Of no less importance is the develop ment of the Veredlungsverkehr This is a method of international coopera tion by which the German manufac turer is supplied with raw products with the understanding that he shall turn over to the foreign merchant a certain percentage of the manufac tured goods Throughout the process raw materials and finished goods re main the property of the foreign firm until the German manufacturer has liquidated his loan Special facilities are offered by the German govern ment for the development of this method of cooperation It forms the most effective and economic means of translating German labor into pur chasing power in the raw material markets It has moreover from the German point of view the advantage that the manufacturer is no longer tempted to import excessive amounts of raw material using bank credit or pledging his factory as security The foreign merchant moreover bears all risks of changes in the market prices On the other hand the foreign firms profit not only by the cheap costs of production but also in their being able to control the character of the finished goods the place where the goods shall be marketed and the price they shall bring thereby affording greater pro tection to their own domestic industry An additional benefit accrues to both from the use thus made of an already existing sales organization In order to protect the interests of the foreign firm a number of trust organizations have 85THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY been organized which will guarantee that the raw material supplied will be used as provided for in the contract and that the property rights of the for eign firm will be fully protectedl According to the Deutsche Wirtschafts zeitung of May 1 1920 a company was organized in New York with a capi tal of 2000000 for the purpose of supplying raw cotton to German firms and accepting finished goods in pay ment The Lancashire textile firms and those of Holland and Italy have established this method of cooperation with the German factories with vary ing degrees of success The ultimate effect of this method of trading is not different from that of the direct barter established through the Swiss Barter Institute2 and through private organizations like the Central European Trading Company of Lon don which exchanges raw products for their equivalent in finished goods with the firm Schubach Thiemer  Co of Hamburg In principle the difference between the Veredlungsverkehr and the direct barter method lies in the fact that the former is essentially a credit transac tion financed by the owner of the raw material while the latter is as a rule a cash transaction3 The barter method allows the Ger man dealers to procure their raw materials in exchange for essentially German goods and allows them greater freedom in selecting goods for this ex change which possess a large degree of 1 The Deutsche WarenTreuhand A G of Ham burg organized in the spring of 1920 is one of these institutions 2 A detailed description of the Schweizerische genossenschaft fur Warenaustausch can be found in Die Schweizerische Volkswirtschaft im Ueber gangsjahr 1919 Published by the Schweizerische Bankverein of Basel 3 The Geschafte mit Valuta klausel as practised by the Swiss Barter Institute are credit transac tions in which the country of low exchange sup plies the credit value with a low material cost With out being embarrassed by currency dif ficulties they secure all the benefits of the world market price for their fin ished goods The advantages are to some extent offset by the necessity of employing middlemen and by the gov ernment export regulations which have thus far not favored this method of exchange Germany as a buying and selling market for America presents there fore the following picture It is a country of a low standard of living and a depreciated currency and therefore of low costs in many manufacturing lines except in those lines where raw material or capital investment are the determining cost factors Exports and imports are controlled both as to price and volume according to the needs of the country and of German industry which constantly is becoming more centralized and more easily whipped into line On the whole it is a poor place to sell and a good place to buy Many factors contribute to lessen the danger of this situation Everything which contributes to raising the price level in Germany in terms of gold will accrue to the benefit of American in dustry Indiscriminate export credits will depress the mark still further and will aggravate the situation except in so far as these credits are fully covered by reexports of finished goods The investment of American capital in Ger man industry will have a salutory ef fect in hastening the rehabilitation of the mark and in allowing some measure of control in the sale of finished goods Another method of co6peration by which both sides would profit may be found in agreements which would al low American manufacturers to act as distributing agents for German goods This is spoken of in Germany as a high production coefficient 86THE CHINESE CONSORTIUM AND AMERICAN TRADE RELATIONS in the American and foreign markets The Germans would save time and ex pense in being relieved of the necessity of rebuilding their own sales organiza tion while American interests would profit by being able to control to some extent the basis of competition with American industry at home and abroad The Chinese Consortium and American Trade Relations with China and the Far East By THOMAS W LAMONT J P Morgan and Co XAMINATION of American trade relations with the Far East and the problem of their future develop ment along peaceful lines offer to man ufacturers and merchants an interest ing field of large opportunity and to students and statesmen a realm of use ful study We front the Pacific basin with a great coastline and have in it the important outposts of Hawaii the Philippines Guam and our part of the Samoan group Its trade on our West ern coast in Japan in China in the East Indies in Australia and the South Seas is expanding rapidly and each year must add to its volume and to the importance of our political social and cultural relations to the nations which participate in it In time there must be duplicated possibly exceeded all that has been done in the Atlantic basin Therefore there lies before us as a nation no more important problem than the ordering in peace of the part that we are to play in our several re lationships to it in the Western ocean Surveyeven cursoryof our past experience there is both instructive and interesting Some excellent things dis close themselves but the chief conclu sions that came to me from my survey were first that our changing govern ment had failed almost invariably to maintain a consistent or constant pol icy either toward its neighbors or towards its own traders and second that our commercial efforts had been sporadic and not sustained Probably the first inconstancy reacted upon the second and it is likely that the extraor dinary developments at home that followed the discovery of gold in Cali fornia and our Civil War served to make us selfcentered in our business effort This alternate development and contraction is curiously exempli fied by our commercial experience with China where our trade has moved in a series of definitely marked cycles We began there with the romantic and inspiring era of the clipper ships which sailing chiefly from New Eng land ports began in colonial times to trade with China Slow at first in ex pansion our trade finally grew in im portance After that in the middle of the last century came the period of the great American hongs or business houses in China established by mer chants from New England and New York These hongs after years of extraordinary prosperity one by one surrendered the field to British and European traders no doubt because American ships had by that time dis appeared from the sea and without ships competition with the Europeans was impossible There was still another era developed first by the enterprise of our western merchants and the Pacific Mail Steam ship Company supplemented later by the Canadian Pacific Railway the late James J Hill and men like Robert 87

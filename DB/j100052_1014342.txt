PLEASURE AND CONSIDERABLE LEGISLATION WAS PUT IN FORCE THROUGH THE USE OF THESE POWERS DURING HIS ADMIN ISTRATION NEW EDUCATIONAL AGRARIAN BANKING MINING PETROLEUM AND TARIFF LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED OR ARE IN PROCESS OF LEGISLATION AND THESE DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD BE CLOSELY WATCHED BY AMERI CANS IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY KEEP IN FORMED AS TO WHAT LEGISLATION MAY INTERFERE WITH OR EXPEDITE THE FLOW OF BUSINESS PROTECTIVE TARIFF LEGISLATION IN PARTICULAR IS OF THE GREATEST INTEREST TO THE AMERICAN EXPORTER AT THE PRESENT MOMENT LABOR IN MEXICO IS RATHER UNSETTLED BUT IT IS COMPARATIVELY CHEAP AND THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES THAT CAN BE MANUFACTURED IN MEXICO IN COMPETITION WITH AMERICAN PRODUCTS IS VERY GREAT THE UNITED STATES CAN NOT COMPETE WITH THE NATIVE MANUFACTURES OF SUCH ARTICLES AS THE CHEAPER GRADES OF TEXTILES THE LARGE VARIETY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES RAISED IN MEXICO WILL PERMIT THE ESTABLISH MENT OF MORE IMPORTANT CANNING INDUS TRIES THERE ARE NOW SADDLE AND LEATHER MANUFACTURES SUGAR REFINERIES TOBACCO FACTORIES FACTORIES FOR MAKING SOAP GOLD AND SILVER ORNAMENTS SOFT DRINKS WEARING APPAREL AND NUMEROUS OTHER THINGS OF LESS IMPORTANCE AS THESE INDUSTRIES INCREASE IN OUTPUT SO THAT THE HOME MARKETS CAN BE CONVENIENTLY SUPPLIED IMPORT TARIFFS WILL BE ESTAB LISHED TO PREVENT FOREIGN COMPETITION SUCH LEGISLATION MAY INCONVENIENCE IN DIVIDUAL EXPORTERS BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE OF ANY LEGISLATION OR OTHER OBSTACLE THAT CAN PREVENT INCREASE IN EXPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES TO MEXICO BETWEEN 1909 AND 1919 THE VALUE OF EXPORTS INCREASED FROM 49 793323 TO 131455101 OR 160 PER CENT IN SPITE OF REVOLUTIONS THE WORLD WAR AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE FACTORS IT IS SAFE TO PREDICT THAT DURING THE NEXT DECADE THE INCREASE WILL BE MUCH LARGER IN SPITE OF DECLINING VALUATIONS OF DECLARED EXPORTS THE PRESENT OUTLOOK FOR UNITED STATES TRADE WITH GERMANY BY J ANTON DE HAAS PHD PROFESSOR OF FOREIGN TRADE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION NEW YORK UNIVERSITY TRADE DOES NOT DEVELOP NATURALLY BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES TECHNIC ALLY IN A STATE OF WAR THE WAR TRADE BOARD RULING 814 WAS AMENDED ON JULY 8 1920 SO AS TO ALLOW ALL PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES ON OR AFTER JULY 8 1920 TO TRADE AND COMMUNICATE WITH ALL PERSONS WITH WHOM TRADE AND COM MUNICATION ARE PROHIBITED BY THE TRAD ING WITH THE ENEMY ACT BUT THE LEGAL STATUS OF CONTRACTS BETWEEN AMER ICAN AND GERMAN CITIZENS AND THE DE GREE OF PROTECTION WHICH THEIR PROPERTY WOULD ENJOY ARE SUBJECT TO MUCH UN CERTAINTY GERMANY FROM HER SIDE HAS IN MANY WAYS FACILITATED AMERICAN BUSI NESS NO FORCED LIQUIDATION OF AMER ICAN FIRMS HAS TAKEN PLACE DURING THE WAR AND THE LAW OF APRIL 21 1920 PROVIDES FOR THE REINSTATEMENT OF FOR EIGN PATENTS AND ANNOUNCES THAT THE PERIOD FROM AUGUST 1 1914 TO JULY 31 1919 WILL NOT BE COUNTED AS PART OF THE LEGAL DURATION THE FACT THAT THROUGH OUR FAILURE TO RATIFY THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES WE FORFEITED THE BENEFITS AS SURED UNDER 297 WITH THE RESULT THAT AMERICAN FIRMS IN GERMANY ARE NOW SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT OF THE REICHS NOTOPFER IS EMBARRASSING TO THOSE FIRMS BUT DOES NOT SERIOUSLY INTERFERE 80THE PRESENT OUTLOOK FOR UNITED STATES TRADE WITH TRADE AN EFFECTIVE CHANNEL OF TRADE INFORMATION HAS BEEN REESTAB LISHED THROUGH THE AMERICAN ASSOCIA TION OF COMMERCE AND TRADE OF BERLIN WHICH RECENTLY HAS OPENED OFFICES IN NEW YORK UNDER THE NAME THE AMER ICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF BERLIN AND WHOSE OFFICIAL ORGAN TRANSATLANTIC TRADE IS DEVOTED TO GERMANAMERICAN TRADE INFORMATION WHETHER A RAPID REVIVAL OF TRADE CAN BE EXPECTED AFTER PEACE IS FINALLY DE CLARED AND WHETHER THIS TRADE WILL HOLD OUT LARGE BENEFITS TO AMERICAN INDUS TRY ARE QUESTIONS WHICH CAN ONLY BE TENTATIVELY ANSWERED AFTER A CONSIDERA TION OF THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS INVOLVED GERMANYS UNFAVORABLE COMMODITY BALANCE OF SOME 100000000 IN 1913 IS LARGELY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE INCOME OF THE GERMAN MERCHANT MARINE WHICH AT THAT TIME REPRESENTED APPROXI MATELY 10 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL WORLD TONNAGE AND BY THE INCOME OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS THE REDUCTION OF THE MERCHANT MARINE TO 300000 GROSS TONS THE LOSS OF THE COLONIES THE LIQUIDATION OF OVERSEA INVESTMENTS THE CONFISCA TION OF TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF MARKETING ORGANIZA TIONS HAVE CUT INTO THE MEANS FORMERLY AVAILABLE TO GERMANY FOR THE PAYMENT OF ITS IMPORTS GERMAN IMPORTS MUST IN THE FUTURE TO A LARGER DEGREE THAN BEFORE THE WAR BE PAID FOR BY EXPORTS THE HIGHER THE PAYMENT EXACTED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PEACE TREATY AND THE LOWER THE PRICE AT WHICH COMMODITIES WILL BE ACCEPTED IN LIQUIDATION OF THE DEBTS THE GREATER THE FLOOD OF COM MODITIES FROM GERMANY MUST BE RAW MATERIAL IMPORTS TERRITORIAL LOSSES WILL COMPEL GER MANY TO IMPORT A LARGER SHARE OF ITS RAW MATERIAL IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS IRON INDUSTRY ON THE SAME BASIS AS IN 1913 ASSUMING THAT THE BUILDING OF NEW FACTORIES WILL EQUALIZE THE LOSS OF 7 THE ALSACELORRAINE AND SILESIA PLANTS GERMANY WILL NOW BE OBLIGED TO IM PORT AT LEAST 35000000 TONS OF ORE YEARLY AS COMPARED WITH 14000000 TONS BEFORE THE WAR THE REDUCTION IN POPULATION RESULTING FROM TERRITORIAL AND WAR LOSSES WOULD UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS HAVE MEANT A DECREASE IN THE IMPORT OF FOODSTUFFS THE FALLING OFF OF DOMESTIC PRODUCTION RESULTING FROM WAR NEGLECT LACK OF FERTILIZER AND DIMINISHED LABOR EFFICIENCY COMBINED WITH TERRITORIAL LOSSES MAKE GERMANY AT PRESENT MORE THAN EVER DEPENDENT UPON THE OUTSIDE WORLD THE AMOUNT WHICH GERMANY MUST IMPORT IN RAW MATERIAL AND FOODSTUFFS IN ORDER TO REESTABLISH A NORMAL ECO NOMIC LIFE IS STILL FURTHER INCREASED BY THE TOTAL EXHAUSTION OF ALL RESERVE STOCKS ECONOMICALLY GERMANY IS LIVING A HANDTOMOUTH EXISTENCE AND IT CAN NOT RETURN TO A NORMAL ECONOMIC LIFE UNTIL THE STOCKS NECESSARY TO GIVE IN DUSTRY AND COMMERCE STABILITY HAVE BEEN REPLENISHED AND THE MACHINERY OF INDUSTRY AND TRANSPORTATION HAS BEEN RESTORED TO ITS FULL PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY THE AMERICAN BUSINESS MAN MUST THEREFORE REALIZE THAT THE COUNTRY WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN REPRESENTED TO HIM AS HIS MOST DANGEROUS TRADE RIVAL IS NOW PLACED IN THE POSITION WHERE ITS FORMER ENEMIES EXERT THEMSELVES TO FORCE IT TO INCREASE ITS EXPORTS OF MANU FACTURED GOODS AND TO RESTRICT ITS IM PORTS TO NECESSARY RAW MATERIALS ONLY THROUGH A RIGID AND UNRELAXED CONTROL OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS CAN GERMANY HOPE TO MEET THE PRESENT EMERGENCY THIS

BRANCH ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGH LOSS OF TERRITORY AND FORCED LIQUIDATION DRIVE THE CRIPPLED ORGAN IZATIONS INTO NEW ALIGNMENTS AB SORBING ALREADY ESTABLISHED CONCERNS IS THE QUICKEST METHOD TO SECURE LARGER PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY SINCE THE BUILDING OF NEW PLANTS IS AT PRESENT BOTH TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY BY ACQUIRING LARGER ASSETS SUBJECT TO DEPRECIATION AND ESPECIALLY BY ACQUIRING THEM AT LEAST ON PAPER FOR THE PREVAILING HIGH PRICES THE POSSIBILITY OF MUCH EN LARGED DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS AND OTHER SECRET RESERVES IS OFFERED AS A WELCOME CLOAK WITH WHICH TO HIDE THE ENORMOUS PROFITS RESULTING FROM A RISING PRICE LEVEL THE FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH LIQUIDATION IN ENEMY COUN TRIES ENABLE THE LARGER PLANTS TO ABSORB THE SMALLER PURELY DOMESTIC CONCERNS WHO THROUGH THE DEPRECIATION OF THE

INDUSTRY A DE TERMINED EFFORT IS MADE TO MAKE ALU MINUM TAKE THE PLACE OF COPPER IN ORDER TO DO AWAY WITH THE NECESSITY OF IMPORTING LARGE QUANTITIES OF ORE WHICH WOULD BE NEEDED TO SATISFY THE COPPER

COMPENSATING FACTORS TWO SIGNIFICANT SUGGESTIONS APPEAR IN A NOTICE IN THE BOARD OF TRADE JOUR NAL OF DECEMBER 1920 ONE TO THE EF FECT THAT PRACTICALLY ALL THE ARTICLES ABOUT WHICH THERE IS A COMPLAINT OF DUMPING IN ENGLAND DO NOT REQUIRE AN EXPORT LICENSE IN GERMANY THE OTHER INDICATING THAT THE COMPLAINTS REFER NOT SO MUCH TO THE VOLUME AS TO THE SKILL WITH WHICH THE GOODS ARE PLACED ON

THE GERMAN POTASH SYNDICATE ESTIMATES THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORKMAN AT ABOUT 50 PER CENT2 THE FAILURE OF GERMAN FIRMS TO ABIDE BY THEIR CONTRACTS AND THE PRACTICE OF THE EXPORT OFFICES TO

Real Estate Trust Company Philadelphia The solution of the problem of a central bank with power to control the currency of the United States to be at all adequate must depend upon and be controlled by ultimate political principles The same principle that underlies the neverending conflict between the advocates of a strong centralized government and what are called states rights governs this question Taught in the school of experience and adversity the early English and American patriots learned the salutary lesson that the development of peoples as well as their happiness depended more upon libertythat is the power to control and govern themselves rather than to be controlled or governed by anybody elsethan upon any other single thing and they therefore in drafting our Constitution always viewed government as an evil made necessary by the weakness and defects of human nature and never extended it be yond that necessity Under the plan of freedom of selfreliance selfdependence selfgovernment we have become the greatest the happiest the most powerful people of the world but notwithstanding these proofs to justify the work of the Fathers we have more and more concluded that we could have done a great deal better We are rapidly tending in the opposite direction which must inevitably destroy liberty by vesting all discretion in some form of central government rather than in the people as individual independent entities Starting with the theory that government but existed because of the defects of mankind and was but an evil wherever it exceeded the necessity of restraining evil human tendencies we have now reached the higher light wherein we produce schemes of regulat ing everything until liberty is but a name and we govern ourselves by theories entirely independent of the characteristics of the people to whom our systems are to apply It is difficult to find any one nowadays who has not some counsel of perfection and founded 35556 The Annals of the American Academy on it some theory of government that would work perfectly with a perfect race in whom neither selfinterest nor passion existed and that consequently did not need any government at all Among the radical reformers the Nihilists are much more logical than the Socialists because neither system would work with human nature as it is and no system would be required with society so constituted as to make their theories practicable But the strangest development of modern times is that concurrently with the wildest theories against restraint popular opinion is forc ing more and more restraint upon individual freedom of choice that is liberty year by year until business and everything else is being stifled by the almost incomprehensible mass of libertyre straining laws and regulations I suppose today the American peo ple imagine they are a free people but in the sense that they were free in the days of such lesser lights as Washington and Franklin and Jefferson and Hamiltonthat is free to work out their indi vidual independence and salvation unrestrained by any unneces sary lawsthey are veritable slaves Under the leadership of the wonderful statesmen of our age who not confined to either party have a legislative panacea for everything and are mak ing us happy by passing statutes binding us hand and foot on one subject after another all the while increasing public officials and public burdens to enforce them real libertyliberty in the sense that each man must to the greatest possible extent be given free discretion to work out his own salvationis rapidly ceasing to exist But it may be asked what has all this to do with a central bank My answer is everything For this country to be great happy and prosperous it must be really free and freedom just as justice consists in distributing power and opportunity as equally as possible and as much controlled by everybodys individual un trammeled discretion as the nature of things will permit I am as much opposed to undue centralization as I am to Socialism or Nihilism and for an identical reason They are all enemies of liberty and it is only through liberty that mankind can reach the highest forms of development Now what effect will the central bank idea have upon these principles which I have thus I fear crudely stated If it will tend to an equalization of power and opportunity if it will tend 356A Central Bank as a Menace to Liberty 57 to placing as near as may be equal powers and equal restraints upon everybody it is consistent with the spirit of our institutions and the purpose of our civilization and if not being against them it must prove injurious There is not the slighest doubt that the placing of the power in the hands of a single man or a small body of men to issue at his or their uncontrolled will the currency needed for trade would prove at least for awhile an effective measure I doubt whether it would permanently prove so because all history has shown that in the result the placing of too much power any where in its rottingout effect upon peoples has decreased effi ciency There is no more doubt that the creations of dictatorial powers for short periods in such times for instance as those of Cjncinnatus were effective measures than that they were enor mously and even to the point of destruction inefficient as a perma nent system under the Emperors Where a single man can tem porarily wield the effective powers of millions of men developed by freedom he is nearly irresistible but the continuance of that power by destroying the value of the units brings down the totality of strength even to the point of extinction And so if we had a central bank with the power of practi cally fixing the price of every commodity in the United States of aggregating to itself or those who exercised its powers just such proportion of the production of wealth of the Union as they saw fit it would in a little while tend to a selfish use that could be neither effective nor beneficial and like all other forms of inor dinate and unequal power it must become destructive of any repub lican form of government Procuring efficiency not through evo lution and development but tyranny and inequality is a means that all human experience has demonstrated to be fallacious In my own judgment our currency like our other evils is to be remedied by greater freedom and greater distribution of choice and discretion rather than by a greater centralization or unequal distribution of power It is a fair question to ask therefore whether conceding as I do that there is not sufficient elasticity of the currency I can suggest no remedy but would prefer present evils to those resulting from the creation of too centralized a power and the answer to my mind is obvious The true remedy must be found not in placing our dependence upon the discretion 35758 The Annals of the American Academy of any one but of every onethat is again upon liberty rather than upon power and restraint We have a very satisfactory system of regulating the invest ments of saving funds that demonstrates that a line of investment can be easily named in advance by statute that would be a safe basis for currency as well as for investments as at present In my judgment therefore starting with government bonds which should always be given a great advantage in currency issues as that strengthens the credit of the Union a list could be made upon which any bankand again the banking laws should be equally open to allcould issue its notes A system of taxation on such issues should be so regulated as to make inordinate inflation impossible but there should be no limit to the amount of circulation when the tax had reached a point where it must become unprofitable to the banks that take out that circulation for then they would only take it out to save the commercial community and their customers and for no dangerous purposes And this currency so available should be available at the discretion of everyone without the necessity of consulting any government official or any government bank I do not want to be misunderstood The restrictions as to security should be full and ample the taxation large and on an ascending scale The currency should be made absolutely safeas safe as it is nowand the tax collected with such a system if that tax were properly applied would not only be sufficient to guard every holder of a note against loss but would yield large revenues be yond this to the government in relief of general taxation With such a system worked out in detail governmental power would not be increased the danger of depriving the people of any part of their selfdeveloping discretions would not be incurred This as I have said is all very crudely stated by a man who has no opportunity to work out details or polish sentences but it recommends itself to me because my whole study of the constitu tional history of our peoples has convinced me that liberty is the greatest friend of mankind just as inordinate powers are the great est danger We shall go higher and better and further follow ing out in all our troubles a liberty as wide as human defects will permit than hunting around for benevolent despots in any form for I do not believe that even benevolent despots ever do real good because however well they may govern the injury to 358A Central Bank as a Menace to Liberty 59 communities inflicted by taking from them the educational benefits of selfgovernment is incalculable Both religion and science teach us that human advance is but to be gained through the slower methods of development of char acterthe one calling it regeneration the other evolution or survival of the fittest or what you will Even in politics and by politicians these principles are at times heededeven now we are daily told that the policy of the government is to educate the Filipinos to a fitness for selfgovernment by gradually entrust ing them with widening discretions increased liberty as this in creasing liberty fits them for more This is true political science the only waythese men are unquestionably Filipino patriots but what we need is American patriotsmen who will make way for liberty here as well as there who will disregard popularity if need be that they may abide with duty and not piecemeal ex change our birthright of freedom for a mass of legislation and re straint only really effective for evil Many many injurious steps have already been taken toward the inequality and slavery of over government and benumbing restriction But all of them will be but a drop in the bucket compared with the dangers of placing in the hands of the few the entire discretion as to the volume of the peoples money In an ultimate analysis our country is only languishing for liberty and equality and I do not hesitate to predict an instant return of prosperity at the first moment that honest men can make investments and conduct important affairs without the neces sity of having a lawyer at their elbows who indeed in most cases refuses the responsibility of advising what all the accumulating mass of restrictive legislation means We have evils enough in this direction without restraining the peoples right to determine when or to what extent their interests require a further supply of cur rency on a sound basis If we really need all the present restric tive mass of regulative legislation we are like the Filipinos already unfit for freedom and if as I believe we do not by taking away our personal right of choice of initiative we are being educated as rapidly as possible to be like them unfit for selfgovernment If these hasty suggestions should chance to reach the eye of someone with a faculty for leadership and a love of his country and invite him to battle again for freedom to expose the shams 3596o The Annals of the American Academy under which the people are losing their freedom under the pre tense that their enemies are being punished I can promise him the ultimate approval of his countrymen For that in the end and permanently only comes to real patriots those that unite instead of divide those that love instead of hate those that putting aside malice envy and all uncharitableness understand the potency of good will to men while never forgetting that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty 360

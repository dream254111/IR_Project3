Appendix to the Description of the Great Melbourne Telescope ByT R Ro0BINsoNDD FRS c Received FebruarylO 1869 Abstract Since this paper was read the author has made several observations of the quantity of light traiismitted ly objectglasses and determined the index of absoiption in various specimenis of glass The results of some of these are in accordance witlh the opinion expressed in the paper but others present a differenec which is very satisfactory as indicating a sur prising progress in the manufacture of optical glass The observations were made bv means of Ziillners photomiieter The following results were obtainied for the intenisity of the light trans mitted by a variety of objectglasses Description Aperture Focus lintensity in inl a Triple objectglass  2 75 48 0 5497 b

the difference being due to the reflection at the film of cement g is also by Grubb alnd cemenlted the glass is by Chance It is by Fraunhofer On examining this Table the progressive increase in the light of the objectglasses is evident The first two which may be considered good specimnens or the early achromatic have less illuminatingpower than the HIerschelian reflector A great advance was made by Guilnand and those who followed in his steps alncl a still greater one by Chance whose glass is niearly perfect as to colour and transparency The same ilnferelnce follows fromn the authors measure

on ani isosceles prism parallel to its base it emerges parallel to itself after uildergoing total internial reflection at the base  and the length of the path of the light within the glass and the loss by the two reflectionis are easily calculated from the known angle and refractive index The mean index used in the calculation was that of the line E The results are given in the following Table

No 1 was shown to the author in 1830 by Captain Kater as the chef dauvre of the GlassCommittee lhe used it as the small speculumn of his Newtonian Afterwards it came into the possessioni of the late Lord Rosse who made the above measures with Bunsens photometer in 1848 It is English plate greenish Nos 2 3 4 5 were measured by Mr Grubb in 1857 No 5 was a prism of 90 HIe does lnot remenber its history but evidelntly it was of Chances glass No 6 is described by Bouguer as c glace 3 Paris inches thick It was probably that of St Gobain which has probably not varied in compo sition and its A has beeln used in the computation No 7 conlsists of two prisms of 60 which Mr Gassiot with hiiswonted kindness intrusted to the author for some inquiries about the improvemenit of the spectroscope They are by Merz of glass which seems nearly iden tical with Faradays dense glass having a specific gravity of 51 and a meanp u l664 It is very pellucicd but like its prototype has a yellowish tinge probably given by the large proportion of lead As Merz does not polish the base or ends of his prisms the usual method could not be employed but the prisms were put together with tlhe angles opposed anld a drop of oliveoil between and thLe reflections allowed for The great1869 Cn the Formation cid Phenomena of Clouds 317 tabsorption is remarkable and apparently cannot be explaincd by the colour of the glass No 8 is of 600 its u for El1620 It is free from colour and an evident improvement on the earlier ones No 9 a prism of 900 was given to the author by Dr Lloyd for a small mirror in the Newtonian form of the Armagh 15inch reflector its u for E 16188 No 10 of 900 was obtained by the late Lord Rosse to be similarly used in his 3feet Newtoniian its t for E I P5321 No 11 of 60 obtained at Munich in 1837 For these measures the ends were polished flat its Mt for E 1P6405 These three show conisiderable progress and an objectglass nmade of such materials would have a great power of transmission though much behind the following No 12 is of 900 Its glass is from Chance its A for E16216 No 13 is a cylinder 22 inches in diamneter and 43 long which Mr Grubb obtained from Messrs Chance for these measures its u for E  15200 No 14 is a cylinder got at the same time 21 inches in diameter and 44 long its  for E  1 6 126 the ends of both are polished flat and they are of wonderful transparency If as there is good ground for hoping Messrs Chance shall succeed in mannfacturing large disks of the same perfection as these two cylinders the authors comparison of the achromatic alnd the reflector must be considerably modified Assuming n 02 he calculates that the aperture of an achromatic of focal length equal to 18 times the aperture equivalent to a 4feet Newto nian is 35 435 inches This aperture would be diminished if the process of cementing were found applicable to lenses of such magnitude The author concludes with suggestinig that as very slight variatioins in the manufacture of glass seem to miake great chaniges in its absorptive power it would be prudent to examine the value of n in the disks intended for lenses of any importance This could be donie by polishing a couple of facets oln their edges and need lnot involve the sacrifice of maniy minutes

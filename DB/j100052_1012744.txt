j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1012744,County Budgets Economy and Efficiency in Expenditures,i242632,COUNTY BUDGETS ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY IN EXPENDITURES BY JAMES E BOYLE PHD Professor of Economics and Political Science University of North Dakota People seldom improve when they have no model but them selves to copy This simple truth helps explain the bad financial situation existing in many of our three thousand counties Counties have not been able to compare themselves with other counties in their own state or with more distant counties in other states Such a comparison would have led to progress In this article I shall point out some existing defects in county finances and in county accounting and the progress which is being made in curing those defects And in conclusion I shall attempt to formulate the principles which must be found in any ideal system of economy and efficiency in county budgetary matters I PRESENT SITUATION BAD 1 In County Finances In making some inquiries recently concerning county expendi tures for bridges I found that two adjoining counties had bought steel bridges of the same size and style and of the same company and at about the same time One county paid at the rate of twenty one dollars per running foot the other at the rate of fortytwo dollars or exactly twice as much This case is believed to be typical of the lax methods of buying supplies for county purposes The practice of piling up a big floating debt is another evil all too common This is done in spite of the fact that the constitution of the state usually places definite limits to the county tax levy Governor Johnson of Minnesota in his message of January 9 1907 and Governor Dawson of West Virginia in his message of January 8 1907 both pointed out this evil in their states Governors messages and state statutes everywhere show the prevalence of the practice These documents form an echo of the old old story of our county government there is the constitutional debt and tax levy limit the county spends more than this limit warrants are 199THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY issued and stamped unpaid for want of funds the county piles up a big floating debt then the county is either permitted to fund the debt and issue bonds in excess of the bond limit or to effect a com promise and scale down the debta quasi repudiation of part of the debt In the early 70s and 80s Kansas was one of the con spicuous offenders in this debtmaking debtscaling process That this state has not wholly lost appetite for this discreditable practice would seem evident from a recent statute Laws of 1907 ch 137 providing that cities of the first and second classes may compromise and refund outstanding indebtedness Constitutional limitations and legislative control have proved inadequate Central administra tive control is essential to sound financing Counties deposit their cash balances in banks In some cases interest is paid to the county in most cases however judging from replies from the various states no interest reaches the county treasury Among the other common shortcomings of county financial administration are the following 1 Expensive junkets by county boards to inspect county build ings in distant states Expert advice on county improvements is now available in a much better and cheaper form 2 Exercise of unauthorized powers such as the abatement of taxes 3 County charges not strictly construed Often claims are paid which are not authorized by the express provisions of the law Everything from cigars and fountain pens to banquets is found under this charge 4 Inadequate audit or no audit at all In many cases where the law provides for an audit of bills the statute is weak and a per functory audit is the result 5 Additional compensation under various guises Various county officers augment their legal compensation by putting in claims for extra work for extra clerk hire for materials and supplies bought and by various other devices 6 Temporary loans In some cases bonded debts are created for current expenses 7 Fees Fees are often wrongfully kept or applied In some instances the public has no knowledge of the officers compensation since he keeps the fees and makes no accounting 200COUNTY BUDGETS 8 Defective county organization Too many coordinate elective officials with no centralization of financial powers and no administrative headship The county has been our most neglected unit of government Too much politics and too little business has been the situation Inefficient personnel has been the rule Tenure of office is short Merit is not rewarded The county office is a blind alley leading nowhere Hence the lax methods the losses in buying materials and constructing permanent improvements Underlying all these evils is the evil of bad accounting 2 Situation in County Accounting A statistical jungle is the name applied by Mr Chas F Gettemy to the town and city finances of Massachusetts This phrase might well be applied to county accounting in most of the American states Some evidence on this point will make the matter clear For instance we read in the auditors report for New Castle county Delaware for 1912 these typical statements We wish to state that in our opinion there is urgent need for necessary legislation to permit the county to adopt some compre hensive system of bookkeeping a system that would centralize the accounts of the various offices in one place where the condition of the countys affairs could be readily ascertained    As will be seen by the statement of bonded indebtedness 695000 of borrowed money has been invested in highway improvements There are no books to show what the county owns for the expenditure of this sum We cannot find any explanation of the item Unappropriated Funds which appears in the comptrollers statement amounting to 16685484 This same report contains a statement of taxes for various purposes such as for instance Poor Tax    101869T7rlo These fractional cents are carried out punctiliously through several columns of figures This nice regard for petty details and jaunty disregard for big and essential things is one of the most universal defects in county accounting Mobile county Alabama for instance tells us how much the county expended for fresh meat for paupers but not how many 201THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY paupers were fed or what the per capita cost of poor relief is or how much is spent for the construction and how much for the maintenance of good roads or how much for education Dane county Wisconsin issues a 200page pamphlet entitled Proceedings of the Board of Supervisors which contains besides the proceedings the abstract of the assessment of each town town ship in the county a comparative statement for four years of the assessed value of each town village and city in the county detailed statistics of all the principal crops for each town the annual report of the commissioners of the poor and finally good illustrations showing the countys poor farm and buildings While this booklet is in most respects an ideal publication for the countyin fact a model for other counties to copyyet from the standpoint of county finances it has one serious defect It contains no summary of county finances And this is exactly the question of first importance to the county and to the taxpayer into whose hands this booklet comes Dozens of similar pamphlets might be cited notably those from the counties of Los Angeles Denver Kings Washington etc all excellent in most ways yet deficient in their method of reporting county finances Some omit the inventory of county property Some omit statistics of the preceding year so that no comparison of the two years can be made Few attempt to print a county budget The exception to this is Erie county New York which prints the proceedings of the board of supervisors and a complete detailed budget for the current year and the estimated budget for the coming year Few show the debt transactions for the year Very few have solved the problem of classifying receipts and expenditures And very few counties use the same form of reports Enough has been said to indicate the great diversity of methods in keeping and reporting county accounts Uniform county account ing would seem to appeal to every man as the best method Yet I find a difference of opinion here among county treasurers and county auditing officers One county treasurer in Wisconsin writes Every county ought to have the right to dictate its own way of accounting A county clerk in Virginia takes exactly the opposite view Uniform accounting is one test that measures efficiency in county government It is refreshing to note the great progress already made and now being made in securing this improvement in various states of the Union 202COUNTY BUDGETS 203 II PROGRESS MADE It will be impossible within the limits of this article to sum marize all the laws on uniform county accounting in the United States The four most important ones only are given in detail the others are briefly mentioned Ohios law is undoubtedly the best with those of Massachusetts New York and Indiana as close rivals Ohios law has now been in successful operation for ten years During that time the aggregate findings of the state examiners of illegal fees and unauthorized payments from county treasuries amount to over two million dollars of which amount about onehalf has been restored to the public funds The Ohio law was enacted in 1902 95 Ohio p 511 and has since been amended sections 274289 General Code of Ohio strength ening it along certain administrative lines This act creates a Bureau of Inspection and Supervision of Public Offices and makes provision for a uniform system of public accounting auditing and reporting in every public office in the state An efficient corps of field agents known as state examiners employed on a civil service basis make personal examinations in the various taxing districts Uniform accounting is prescribed for all offices of the same grade and accounts of the same class The findings are published The enforcement of the law in case money is due the county is left first to the county prosecuting officer and then if he refuse or neglect to act to the attorneygeneral of the state STATEMENT OF FINDINGS TO NOVEMBER 15 1912 Counties Findings for Illegal Unclaimed Total Year Recovery Payments Moneys Illegal Returns 1903  5026803 1880891 80782 6988476 1074193 1904 5780554

loss from incompetent officials than from dishonest ones The efficient work of the bureau is shown by the table on page 203 Contrary to general impressions the county losses are of far greater importance than those of any other taxing district or than those of all other taxing districts combined The following table shows that at least sixty per cent of the leakages occur in the counties

stated above for the reason that the law does not require a report on such restitutions But here as elsewhere prevention is better than cure and the errors and peculations prevented by this law are beyond our powers of computation New Yorks law 1905 ch 705 requires counties villages and cities to report annually to the state comptroller on a form pre scribed by him He publishes an annual summary The field examiners are on a civil service basis Prior to the passage of this law the county accounts were audited only by a committee in the county These examinations were perfunctory indeed recent examinations prove they were only an expression of good faith in the official whose record was examined The report for 1910 shows that for the ten counties examined the moneys improperly and illegally expended amounted to 11143739 or 5 per cent of the total expenditures One county showed 16 per cent  1COUNTY BUDGETS The comptrollers report goes to each county It contains specific detailed and circumstantial criticisms of county short comings Concerning one county we find this criticism in the 1912 report A committee was obtained by the board of supervisors to investigate the findings of this examination Subsequently there was restored to the treasury of Steuben county in the neighborhood of 20000 7500 of which was restored by the former superintendent of poor The New York report also contains tables of comparative statistics noteworthy for their excellent classification cf receipts and expenditures County receipts are given under these nine heads 1 balance on hand 2 taxes 3 from the state 4 from municipalities 5 fees and receipts from county officers 6 temporary loans 7 sale of bonds 8 trust funds 9 miscella neous County expenditures are grouped under these seventeen headings 1 administrative salaries including the sheriff elections 2 legislative 3 judicial courts judges including constables 4 regulative fish game quarantine 5 educational 6 defensive military 7 penal 8 curative defective 9 charitable poor 10 protective maintenance of county buildings and grounds 11 constructive purchase of lands and buildings 12 good roads construction 13 highways maintenance 14 general temporary loans bonded debt refunds etc 15 trust funds 16 transfers 17 miscellaneous These comparative statistics have one serious defect for purpose of comparison they do not give us the units of comparison except the population of counties Construction of good roads means little unless we know how much road was constructed The cost of poor relief means nothing unless we know how many poor were cared for And so on through the list Actual comparison is impossible In Massachusetts as in the other New England states the county is a very unimportant unit of government Hence any good work done there in county accounting has been largely neglected or ignored by the other states In 1887 Massachusetts created the office of Controller of County Accounts An annual report of about forty pages is published containing tabulations but no comments criti cisms or suggestions Hence it is inferior to the New York report It does show however the county treasurers depositing county 205THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY funds with interest and without interest The county debt is also given But no debt transactions for the year are reported and no inventories And there are no units for comparison given not even population Hence these comparative statistics  have only a small value The very efficient Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics supervis ing town and city finances uses the following classification which may easily be adapted to county reporting Receipts I Revenue I 1 General II Taxes III Etc 2 Commercial IV Special assessment privileges V franchises VI Interest Etc II NonRevenue 1 Offset to Outlays sales of real estate insurance for property destroyed etc 2 Municipal Indebtedness Loans 3 From Sinking Fund 4 Agency Trust and Investment Transactions Payments Maintenance Interest Outlays for any visible increase in assets Municipal Indebtedness To Sinking Fund Agency Trust and Investment Transactions This scheme offers both a good classification and a proper differentiation between maintenance outlay and other expenditures Indiana like Ohio has gone into the science and art of uniform accounting very seriously and very effectively The Indiana law 1909 ch 55 amended March 3 1911 creates a Department of Inspection and Supervision of Public Offices having jurisdiction over every public office in the state The administration of the law was entrusted at the outset to one state examiner two deputies one clerk and fiftytwo field agents working on a civil service basis Uniform accounting is prescribed and installed Comparative statistics are compiled by the state examiner and published annually so that the fruits of this department are available to the public The workings of this law have been similar to those in New 206COUNTY BUDGETS York and Ohio Passing over the findings in townships school districts and cities we find reports like the following from counties And in another instance of shortage a county treasurer at the close of his term claimed the county was indebted to him and the commissioners allowed his claim of 4900 The report of our examination of his official records revealed the fact that he was actually short 5100 at the close of his term and should not have received the amount of his claim the payment of which made him indebted to the county in the sum of 10000 Suit was brought in behalf of the county to recover the funds The 5100 was paid by his bondsmen the remainder lost to the county This discrep ancy was due in great measure to poor methods of accounting There was an admitted shortage of 66000 in another county   In another county the records show the disbursement of 425 for fountain pens during a period of four years The field work of the Indiana bureau is of inestimable value to the state The published report however has the defect common to all other reports namely no standardized units of comparson Attention must now be given to states which have made progress in 1 state examination and supervision of local accounting 2 in uniform accounting or 3 in both Wyoming constitution 1890 provided for a state examiner By statute he now supervises state and local accounting and banks but does not prescribe uniform accounting or publish his findings According to Wyoming authorities The examination of public accounts is technical and embraces the checking of every item whether great or small the subsequent footing of the cash accounts and finally their summation Every account paid is closely examined the nature of the expense ascertained and the legality of the bill inquired into and the amount is finally checked to the stub of the warrant issued and also entered in the proper column of the expense register Whether or not the officer conducted his office in conformity with the statute is also made a subject of inquiry Here we have outlined an ideal plan of audit North Dakota Laws of 1893 ch 95 1907 ch 232 1911 ch 62 provided a state examiner to supervise and inspect financial accounts of all state and county officers and to prescribe and enforce correct methods He has not however prescribed any methods Another state board Board of Control of penal and 207THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY charitable institutions has power to prescribe uniform accounting for these institutions but has not exercised this power Another statute gives the state auditor power to install a uniform system of accounting in state institutions and finally the state tax com missioner is empowered to formulate a uniform accounting system The state does not yet have uniform accounting This state and Wyoming both have good state supervision but no publication of results and no uniform accounting Kansas Laws of 1895 ch 247 1911 has now provided for the gradual installation by the state tax commissioner of a uniform system of accounting for counties townships and school districts Georgia 1902 p 57 amended Code 1910 pp 416 417 418 provided that counties might employ expert accountants and that certain counties might have auditors Iowa 1902 ch 23 1907 ch 24 required the county auditor to make a financial report in pamphlet form and the state auditor under the new law prescribed uniform accounting for county treasurers auditors clerks of district courts and also for cities and towns villages A volume of comparative statistics is published Nevada 1903 chs 78 123 provided for an annual county report to the state comptroller on a prescribed form for supervision of local accounts by a state examiner and for the preparation of an annual county budget Florida 1903 chs 14 71 directed the state auditor to prescribe forms of accounts for counties Tennessee 1903 ch 583 provided for a budget for counties of a certain size New Mexico 1903 ch 54 provided for a traveling auditor to inspect county accounts Arizona 1905 ch 40 provided a public examiner who inspects financial records of each county officer Colorado 1907 ch 204 amended in 1909 established the office of public examiner empowered to prescribe and install uniform accounting in all state and county offices and to publish annually a volume of comparative statistics The weak spot in this law as in all similar laws is the dependence of the state authorities on the county prosecuting officers to institute and carry on the suits which 208COUNTY BUDGETS arise out of examinations The states attorneygeneral ought to have full powers to prosecute these suits Oklahoma 1908 ch 79 provided for a State Examiner to establish uniform accounting for county treasurers and to examine the county offices at the request of the county commissioners or of five per cent of the voters This is a weak statute A letter from an Oklahoma official says It would be much more effectual to have the law provide for and make it the duty of the state examiner to establish uniform records for all county officers and to make the examination of all county officers mandatory Other states have been worthy of note Washington 1909 adopted a law much similar to the Ohio plan It has worked well Minnesota 1909 adopted a scheme of securing a system of uniform accounting by state and county auditors and treasurers prescribed and installed by a public examiner West Virginia 1909 adopted the Ohio law placing the administration of it however in the hands of the State Tax Commission Louisiana 1910 provided for a supervisor of public accounts to audit the accounts of the county auditors public boards and state offices County accounting is not yet fully included in this law California 1911 created a Depart ment of Public Accounting empowered to prescribe and install uniform accounting in every public office in the state The depart ment is conducted on a civil service basis Michigan 1911 passed an optional statute empowering the state auditor to formulate uniform accounting for all public offices keeping accounts The findings are published annually as comparative statistics The law is con sidered useless for counties since it is not mandatoryl A few other states have made beginnings more or less feeble towards an efficient system of uniform county accounting Among these are the following Montana Connecticut Idaho South Dakota Wisconsin Nebraska and New Jersey There seem to be nineteen states that have not yet taken the first step towards uniform accounting This blacklist if my information is correct includes Alabama Arkansas Delaware Illinois Kentucky Maine Maryland Mississippi Missouri New Hampshire North Carolina Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina Texas Utah Vermont Virginia 1 Letter from V B Fellen AuditorGeneral of Michigan October 9 1911 Quoted in First Report North Dakota Tax Commission p 112 209THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY III THE IDEAL SYSTEM The showing above made is hopeful A few years ago no states had uniform county accounting or indeed any state supervision whatsoever of county financial matters Now state supervision is the rule And uniform county accounting is rapidly spreading especially the Ohio plan However no state as yet has worked out an ideal system Perhaps this is not possible considering the defects of human nature But however that may be certain well defined principles have been established and any firstclass system must conform to these principles From the foregoing representations there are three important principles apparent Observance of these three principles will mean economy and efficiency in county expenditures Let us examine them separately 1 Since scientific accounting is the basis of a budget system the first principle is uniform accounting There should be uniform accounting prescribed by state authorities and enforcible through the state legal department There should be publication of findings There should be comparative statistics These statistics should permit of a comparison both as to time and units Comparing this year with last year for instance is wholesome As to units it is absolutely essential that a comparison on this basis be possible Not how much did county A spend for bridges last year for instance but how much per foot did county A pay for 16feetwide steel bridges How much per capita for children in school was expended for education And so on Standard units of comparison should be had for every service rendered by the county The published reports of counties and these reports should be published annually in neat pamphlet or book form should give at the very outset a financial summary showing income expenditure and debt transactions for the year This should be followed by a detailed statement properly classified and differentiated The classification might well follow either the New York or Massachusetts plan given above making changes necessary to meet local needs The differentiation should be observed between payments for main tenance and payments for outlay as is done in Massachusetts likewise between revenue and nonrevenue receipts The debt statement should show the object and character of the obligation amount incurred and amount canceled during the year net increase 210COUNTY BUDGETS or decrease and provisions made for debt payment Costly experi ence has taught that the best debt payment plan is now the serial plan Finally a detailed complete inventory should be given of the countys property showing location cost and present value The people want to know what they get for their money and what becomes of this property Why should not the county issue a neat booklet giving a state ment of county finances and various other matters of interest to voters such as the budget tax rate valuations statistical matter concerning county officers names salaries etc and other matters of local interest The publication of Dane county Wisconsin was mentioned as a model book of this kind excepting as to its accounting system Publications of county reports in official county news papers often shabby in appearance at so much per line of type is a relic of governmental barbarism It should be superseded by a more dignified method The voter in the end will be glad to bear the expense of having his county officials dignify their office by putting into his hands an annual statement as neat in appearance and as comprehensible in matter as that put out by the banks the depart ment store or the seed catalog house in his neighborhood 2 A county budget is a selfevident necessity Since efficiency can be shown only by comparison uniform accounting as before stated must precede scientific budget making And examinations have demonstrated that far greater harm results from unintelligent than from dishonest accounting Having secured the intelligent accounting system how should the county budget be made In Erie county New York a board of supervisors of fiftyfour men formulate the budget In Dane county Wisconsin sixtyfour men constitute the county board in Arkansas and some other southern states there is a county levying court composed of all justices of the peace and the county judge in the northwest there is a small board usually three five or seven men the taxing body for Hartford county Connecticut typical of the New England county is made up of the representatives and senators elected to the general assembly from the towns of the county In spite of the success of the Erie county board due chiefly to efficient accounting methods the tendency of efficient county government is towards the small board elected solely for that office The budget should of course contain itemized statements of receipts and payments for the past year 211THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY and estimates for the coming year And of course these statistics should be classified and arranged for easy comparison A condensed statement of the county budget should then be printed on the individuals tax bill This is done very generally But the county booklet described above should contain the full and complete budget 3 Reorganization of county government There is at present a faulty organization of county government which needs reconstruc tion There are too many elective officers and hence lack of proper coordination The people have thus confused the responsibility of most officers and thereby lost control of them One county for instance now elects a keeper of the county home the keeper of the penitentiary the superintendent of poor the auditor the sheriff the county treasurer the surrogate the county judges the district attorney and fiftyfour members of the county board Some officers are on salaries some on fees Many separate depart ments purchase supplies disregarding the saving that would come through a single purchasing agent Some counties buy under competitive bidding some do not Some counties have a real audit of bills as outlined under Wyoming above some have no real audit The commission plan of city government will inevitably suggest the commission form of county government A reorganization according to this shortballot plan safeguarded with a nonpartisan civil service and coupled with the uniform accounting and the scientific budget described above will give us our muchneeded economy and efficiency in county expenditures 212

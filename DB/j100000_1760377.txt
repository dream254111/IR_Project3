proof of good faith Electric measuring apparatus IN the Americanjourn al of science for March Pro fessor Trowbridge describes a form of differential cosine galvanometer in which the action on a magnet of a strong current moving through the fixed vertical circle of a large tangent galvanometer of one metre radius is balanced by the opposite effect of a weak current from a Daniell cell moving in a reverse direc tion through the coil of a cosine galvanometer the fixed and movable coils having a common centre By moving the coil of the cosine galvanometer about its horizontal axis it is easy to secure a balance and thus to determine the magnitude of the strong current An obvious and simple modification of this apparatus consists in substituting for the cosine gal vanometer an ordinary tangent galvanometer with a coil of small radius having a number of turns of wire in circuit with a battery and rheostat By varying the resistance in the circuit a balance can be reached and the strength of the current found A mirror galvanometer thus arranged and in direct circuit with a battery and very high resistance or in derived circuit with a battery and tangent galvanom eter might sometimes be useful as in studying slow variations in strong currents Another instrument which is likely to prove valuable for measuring strong currents is a new form of differential cosine galva nometer recently devised by Mr R H Pierce while a student at the Massachusetts institute of technol ogy The current is caused to pass in opposite direc tions through two concentric circles of nearly the same radius as in Bracketts differential galvanom eter but the inner of these is capable of moving upon a horizontal axis as in the ordinary cosine gal vanomoter and it is revolved until a convenient de flection is secured A simple formula then gives the strength of the current CHAS R CRoss The magnetic declination in 1728 I notice in your issue of Sept 18 a note over the signature  C A S criticising certain statements in regard to the northern boundary of North Caro lina contained in bulletin No 13 of the U S geolo gical survey A more careful perusal would have shown the writer that the points criticised are con tained in an extract from Geology of North Caro lina by Prof W C Kerr 1875 and that the author of the bulletin is not responsible for them HENRY GANNETT Washington DC Sept 21 Composite portraiture Shortly after the publication of my article on Composite portraiture Science Aug 28 my at tention was called to an article by Mr W E Deken ham in the Photographic news of April 24 1885 wherein is figured an arrangement for combining optically more than two photographs which corre sponds very nearly with what I had in mind when I penned the last sentence of my article I have since thought of other methods of solving the problem but have not had the opportunity of putting them to a practical test I was glad to find in the same jour nal April 17 that Mr Galton had been giving his attention to the same subject He says There is nothing respecting composites that I should more NCE 283 gladly hail than the invention of a simple optical method of combining many images into one so as to judge of the effect of a photographic composite be fore making it I also omitted to refer in my article to an im portant application of the stereoscopic method of combining two images namely in getting the co composite of two other composites as Mr Galton does in his  Inquiries into human faculty  frontis piece and more recently in his composites repre senting the Jewish type JOSEPH JASTROW Philadelphia Sept 18 Lower Silurian fossils at Canaan NY The words these limestones in the report of Pro fessor Halls remarks on my paper at the Ann Arbor meeting of the American association published on p 220 of Science for Sept 11 seem to imply that Pro fessor Hall claimed to have known forty years since of Lower Silurian fossils in the Taconic limestone of Canaan Columbia county NY In a recent letter to me lie states that in the expression he had no intention of implying that he knew at that time of fossils at Canaan that he referred to his knowledge of fossils at Hoosic in a limestone which he regarded as of the same age witli that of Canaan The exist ence of fossils at Hoosic also forty miles north of Canaan is additional evidence with regard to the Lower Silurian age of the rocks of the original Ta conic system of Emmons J D DANA New Haven Sept 22 Aquatic respiration of softshelled turtles In your otherwise excellent abstract of our paper on the aquatic respiration of softshelled turtles Science vol vi p 225 not quite enough information is given in the paragraph containing the table to sufficiently explain it We should be glad to have that paragraph read The following table shows the results of the analyses In the first column is given the total amount of free oxygen taken from the water 10 litres in ten hours by a turtle weighing 1 kilogram The second column contains the quan tity of carbon dioxide that could be formed from this oxygen and the third column contains the actual amount of carbon dioxide added to the water by the turtle the excess of which over the amount that could be formed from the oxygen taken from the water is given in the fourth column 0 CO2 Actual CO2 Excess CO2 July 11   71 mg 97T mg 231 mg 133 mng Aug

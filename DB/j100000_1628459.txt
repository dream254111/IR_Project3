men who have not only the training of the technical school but the attitude of mind to attack new problems men who have not simply a basis of theoretical and practical knowledge to begin research but who have the spirit of research as well This demand for research in engineering and for men capable of undertaking such work has long been recognized and the Institute has for some years looked toward the inauguration of a department of en gineering research The installation this year of the Lowell Electrical Engineering laboratories with the additional facilities which are thus offered makes the present an opportune time to undertake this work A graduate school of research will there fore be established as a distinct depart ment of the Institute immediately after the opening of the next academic year namely on October 7 1903under condi tions which are given in the announcement that will be issued An examination of these conditions will make it clear that the intention of the authorities of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is to provide in the Graduate School of Engineering Research facilities for a small number of advanced students who show capacity for research The administration of the School is vested by the corporation and faculty in a council of members of the faculty in eluding the president as chairman The staff will consist of professors and instructors of the Institute and other per sons actually engaged in engineering en terprises Opportunities for advanced study and research will be provided in the following branches of engineering Civil Engineering Sanitary Engineering 941 Mechanical Engineering Electrical Engineering Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Mining Engineering and Metallurgy Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry In these subjects the degree of Doctor of Engineering Eng Dr will be awarded As heretofore the Institute will offer courses of advanced study and research in pure sciencee g mathematics me chanics physics chemistry biology and geologyleading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy PhD These advanced courses will be open also to students of engineering research SCIENTIFIC BOOKS DR MEYER ON SOME EUROPEAN MUSEUMS PENDING the publication of the final part of his memoir on the museums of the eastern United States Dr A B Meyer has given us the results of his observations on some of the museums and other educational institu tions of Great Britain and eastern Europe These were visited in order to make compari sons between them and similar institutions in America and to gather all possible infor mation regarding museum buildings and in stallation The present paper deals espe cially with the three great problems of light heat and ventilation which confront the archi tect of every large museum although the reader will find information on all points of interest The complaint is made that many desired illustrations were not to be had and it has been suggested that the present demand for the illustrated postal card has much to do with the lack of goodsized photographs of many important buildings In regard to lighting Dr Meyer is em phatically of the opinion that the proper method is by side windows and preferably by windows on both sides of exhibition halls in order to check the reflection from the glass of cases standing in shadow The most cus tomary method of lighting is by overhead skylights in order to gain wall space but while this is well enough for a single floor when one or two galleries are introduced it DIoEMBER 12 1902942 SCIENCE naturally results in poor illumination beneath portions of these and the only way to do away with such dark corners is by side win dows The defects of overhead light are shown in the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art and in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons London although the same system is retained in a recent addition in order to preserve uniformity of architec ture The problems of ventilation and heating are considered in various places and the palm awarded to the Glasgow Museum and the Free Public Museum of Liverpool which Dr Meyer emphatically declares excel all other mu seums in the world in respect to the method of heating and ventilating Curiously enough while these two institutions were under con struction practically at the same time neither was aware that the same system of ventilation had been adopted by the other In these two museums the air is drawn in through a large air shaft six by nine feet filtered warmed and forced into the buildings by large blow ers The windows are permanently closed and the pressure of air within kept at a higher point than that of the outside air so that dust is not sucked in through doors or other unavoidable openings In some other mu seums the windows are kept closed and the air more or less cleansed as it is drawn into the buildings but none of the devices adopted is so efficient as that employed at Glasgow and Liverpool known as Keys improved Plenum method Dr Meyer frequently calls attention to the fact that too often the exterior of a museum is designed without reference to the interior when the proper method to be followed is quite the reverse of this and that the arrange ment of the exhibition halls and offices should be decided first and the exterior adapted to them In regard to these same exteriors the illustrations show a great diversity of style and various attempts to combine architec tural effect with room and light One of the least successful of these architecturally seems to be the new museum at Brussels although this may perhaps be compensated for by the abundance of light in the exhibition halls N S VOL XVI No 415 while the most successful judging by the illustrations is the Liverpool Free Museum This however is probably because there is no view of the new Galleries of Comparative Anatomy and Anthropology at Paris whose architectural features and harmonious methods of installation elicit the warmest praise with the exception of the fern leaf decoration of the balcony rails These are said to be over ornamented to such an extent as to be ob trusive a feature that will perhaps be toned down by age The pure Gothic style so often adopted re sults in gloomy interiors but the author calls attention to the fact that the modified gothic such as is used in the University of Chicago may be successfully employed In connec tion with the subject of architecture some thing might well have been said of museum cases for architects are responsible for many failures in this direction and few of them are competent to plan even a moderately good case Dr Meyer is evidently of the opinion that most museums are too freely open to visitors objects on exhibition being ruined by long exposure to light although the Paris mus seums of natural history go the other extreme and are open for so short a time that it is difficult to properly examine the collections Here he touches upon a difficult problem in administration and one which is particularly so in the United States where the tendency is to extend rather than curtail the hours of exhibition In many ways it seems best to submit to the inevitable and after taking every possible precaution to so admit the light that it may be diffused admit the public as freely as possible The rarer objects might be withheld from exhibition or displayed only on certain days or hours while the more com mon objects could be replaced Few if any museums now place their types of birds or mammals on exhibition and the question of showing large mammals and rare birds is be coming serious in view of the destruction now going on Another point incidentally touched on in this paper is what may be termed the over exhibition of specimens the display of soSCIENCE large a number that the visitor is simply be wildered and but little interested or in structed And this point is well made for there is not the slightest doubt that a limited number of specimens well installed and prop erly labeled is in every way better than the large series so often shown The arrangement of natural history collections on a geograph ical basis is also dwelt on in various places and this has always seemed to the present writer the best method by far The predic tion is here ventured that the successful mu seum of the future will so far as the exhibi tion of biological material is concerned con sist of a central synoptic or index collection supplemented by series displaying the geo graphical and geological distribution of plants and animals and various features in their life histories This by no means precludes the display of systematic series wherever this may be thought desirable but this feature of museums is commonly made far too much of The exhibition series of a museum is for the public and the average visitor does not go to the museum for study and the advanced stu dent does not as a rule seek for information in the material on exhibition although there are notable exceptions to this rule in anthro pological collections In the department of anthropology by the way Dr Meyer does not favor a geographical arrangement but advocates bringing together all objects of a kind in order that their devel opment and variation may be seen Where space and material admit however he con siders that there should also be geographical series to illustrate the customs of different races In respect to installation the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford is awarded the first place among English ethnological museums and the scheme of its arrangement is given in full A detail of installation shown in many of the illustrations is the large number of skele tons on exhibition with no protection what ever from dust or visitors and one can but think that either the attendants are more vigilant abroad than here or the visitors more conscientious Specimens so recklessly dis played in this country would run great chance 943 of being ruined by dust or of being broken by relicseeking visitors no specimen that can possibly be put in a case should be ex posed Some of the shortcomings of museums are however unavoidable while others as Dr Meyer is careful to say in his introductory remarks are to a greater extent the fault of the establishment than of the persons in charge for one individual has little control of the many circumstances on which the his torical development of museums and other institutions depends It is to be hoped that Dr Meyer may soon be able to embody his views regarding museums in the construction of a new museum in Dresden but we trust he will not wait until that time to give us a summary of these views and possibly he may present them in his next paper F A L SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND ARTICLES IN The

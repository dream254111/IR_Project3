J100403,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW,1063288,EQUITY PLEADING EXCEPTION OR DEMURRER TO ANSWER,I243819,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW NOW THE ORIGINAL RULE IN MOST OF THE STATES HAD BEEN THAT SAVE WHERE SPECIAL AND PECULIAR EQUITIES EXISTED THE COLLECTION OF ILLE GAL TAXES COULD NEVER BE ENJOINED4 THE PROMPT AND UNEMBAR RASSED COLLECTION OF THE PUBLIC REVENUE WAS CONSIDERED VITAL TO THE WELFARE OF THE STATE5 THOUGH THIS RULE HAS BEEN VERY GENERALLY MODIFIED THE FEDERAL COURT RULE AND THE RULE IN MOST STATES REQUIRES THE PURSUANCE OF A LEGAL REMEDY WHERE SUCH REMEDY EXISTS AND IS ADEQUATE6 IN 1916 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING ACT BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF VIRGINIA THAT NO SUIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTRAINING THE ASSESSMENT OR COLLECTION OF ANY TAX STATE OR LOCAL SHALL BE MAINTAINED IN ANY COURT IN THIS COMMONWEALTH EXCEPT WHEN THE PARTY HAS NO ADEQUATE REM EDY AT LAW PROVIDED THIS ACT SHALL NOT AFFECT ANY PENDING SUIT 7 THUS WAS VIRGINIA BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH THE MORE GENERAL AND IT IS BELIEVED THE MORE DESIRABLE RULE THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTE IS SIMPLY TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS ACT WAS NOT INCORPO RATED BY THE REVISORS INTO THE CODE OF 1919 NOR HAS IT FOUND A PLACE IN ANY SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION ITS OMISSION BY THE REVISORS EFFECTS ITS REPEAL8 IT WOULD SEEM THEN THAT THE LAW STANDS ONCE MORE AS IT STOOD BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF THIS ACT IN 1916 AND THAT TODAY IN VIRGINIA AN ILLEGAL ASSESSMENT MAY BE ENJOINED REGARDLESS OF THE QUESTION OF EXISTING LEGAL REMEDIES T L P EQUITYPLEADINGEXCEPTION OR DEMURRER TO ANSWER THE REPORTS AND LAW BOOKS IN GENERAL ARE FULL OF STATEMENTS TO THE EFFECT THAT A DEMURRER TO AN ANSWER IN CHANCERY IS A PLEADING UN KNOWN TO THE CHANCERY PRACTICE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN FEW CASES INDEED IN WHICH THE APPELLATE COURTS HAVE CONSIDERED A DEMURRER TO AN ANSWER FATAL THE USUAL COURSE IS TO CONDEMN THAT PARTICULAR FORM OF PROCEDURE TREAT THE DEMURRER AS SETTING THE CASE FOR HEAR ING ON BILL AND ANSWER AND PROCEED ACCORDINGLY IN THE FEDERAL COURTS THE RULE LAID DOWN IN CROUCH V KERRL THAT A DEMURRER DOES NOT LIE TO AN ANSWER THE COURT THERE REFUSING TO CONSIDER THE CASE ON THE MERITS BUT GRANTING THE PLAINTIFF

TENDENCY TO BE GUIDED MORE BY THE MAXIM EQ UITY LOOKS TO THE SUBSTANCE RATHER THAN THE FORM THAN BY THE STRICT PLEADING RULE LAID DOWN IN THE CASE ABOVE2 IN THE STATE COURTS ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION A DEMURRER TO AN ANSWER OR PLEA FOR INSUFFICIENCY AS A MATTER OF LAW IS TREATED AS A MATTER OF FORM AND AS IF IT HAD BEEN AN EXCEPTION3 MORE SPE CIFICALLY THE DEMURRER IS TREATED AS SETTING THE PLEA OR ANSWER FOR ARGUMENT I E ON BILL AND ANSWER THE VIRGINIA COURT HAS FOLLOWED THE RULE THAT OBTAINS IN MOST STATES AND WHICH HAS JUST BEEN INDICATED SUCH WAS THE COURSE PURSUED IN KELLY V HAMBLEN4 IN THIS CASE JUDGE KEITH THEN PRESI DENT OF THE COURT RESERVED THE POINT FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION SINCE IT WAS NOT DIRECTLY IN ISSUE ALTHOUGH THE OPINION CONTAINED THE SEMBLE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT A DEMURRER CAN ONLY BE INTER POSED TO A BILL YET THE COURT PROCEEDED TO CONSIDER AND DID HOLD THAT THAT PART OF THE ANSWER DEMURRED TO WAS SUFFICIENT IN LAW IN TWO FAIRLY RECENT VIRGINIA CASES HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT AN EXCEPTION TO AN ANSWER IS TANTAMOUNT TO A DEMURRER5 THIS IS UN QUESTIONABLY TRUE WHEN THE OBJECTION IS TAKEN TO THE ANSWER BE CAUSE IT IS INSUFFICIENT AS A MATTER OF LAW AND IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE CONTRARY TO THE USUAL PRACTICE OF EQUITY IN LOOKING TO THE SUB STANCE AND NOT TO THE FORM TO DISALLOW THE PLEADING IN SUCH CASES BECAUSE IT WAS CALLED A DEMURRER INSTEAD OF AN EXCEPTION THOUGH A PLEADER MAY MISTAKE THE NAME OF HIS PLEADING YET IF IT BE PROPER IN SUBSTANCE THE COURT WILL DISREGARD THE ERROR AND TREAT THE PLEAD ING AS IF IT WERE RIGHTLY NAMED 6 BUT DESPITE SUCH LENIENT RULES THE FACT REMAINS THAT WE HAVE A PLEADING WHICH IN EVERY ESSENTIAL BUT NAME AMOUNTS TO A DEMUR RER TO THE ANSWER AND PERFORMS THE FUNCTION OF SUCH A DEMURRER YET AT THE SAME TIME IT IS UNIVERSALLY STATED THAT A DEMURRER TO AN ANSWER IN CHANCERY IS A PLEADING UNKNOWN TO CHANCERY PRACTICE NATURALLY THIS HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF SOME DIFFICULTY IT IS SUBMITTED THAT MUCH OF THE CONFUSION ON THE POINT IS DUE TO THE FAILURE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO USES OF AN EXCEPTION FIRST TO OBTAIN A BETTER ANSWER AND SECONDLY TO RAISE AN ISSUE OF LAW I E OBTAIN HEARING ON BILL AND ANSWER IN AN EARLY FEDERAL CASE 7 IT WAS HELD THAT AN EXCEPTION COTLD NOT BE MADE TO AN ANSWER 2 WALKER V JACK 88 FED 576 1898 BARRETT V TWIN CITY POWER CO 111 FED 45 1901 S COPELAND V MCCUE 5 W VA

1881 391VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW WHICH WAS INSUFFICIENT IN LAW AS A BAR TO THE PLAINTIFFS SUIT AGAIN IN AN EARLY IOWA CASE 8 IT WAS STATED THAT THE PROPER COURSE WHERE THE ANSWER IF TRUE IS INSUFFICIENT IS TO SET THE CAUSE FOR HEARING ON BILL AND ANSWER WHICH AS THE CASE ASSERTS IS TANTAMOUNT TO A DE MURRER SETTING THE CAUSE FOR HEARING ON BILL AND ANSWER IS OF COURSE WHAT IS ALWAYS DONE IN SUCH CASES BUT THE TWO CASES JUST MENTIONED SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ACCURATELY AN EXCEPTION TO AN AN SWER FOR INSUFFICIENCY IN LAW IS NOT THE PROPER METHOD OF DOING IT THE OBJECT OF THE EXCEPTION WAS TO SECURE A BETTER ANSWER ITS USE IN SETTING THE CASE FOR HEARING ON BILL AND ANSWER IS UNFORTUNATE AND CONFUSING9 IN SHORT ITS ONLY USE WAS TO RAISE A QUESTION OF FORM OR TO OBTAIN A MORE COMPLETE ANSWER AND NOT TO RAISE A QUES TION OF LAW BUT THE TERM EXCEPTION WAS SOON USED TO RAISE BOTH QUESTIONS AND AS A RESULT THERE ENSUED THE DOGMATIC STATEMENT A DEMURRER TO AN ANSWER IN CHANCERY IS A PLEADING UNKNOWN TO CHAN CERY PRACTICE CONSIDERING THE TWO USES MENTIONED ABOVE THE FORMER RAISES NO QUESTION ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE AND CONSE QUENTLY IN NO WAY RESEMBLES A DEMURRER WHILE THE LATTER GOES RIGHT TO THE MERITS AND RAISES AN ISSUE OF LAW DIRECTLY WHICH AS SOME CASES HAVE STATED IS TANTAMOUNT TO A DEMURRER10 IT IS RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED THAT PRACTICE WOULD BE SIMPLIFIED BY RESTRICTING THE EXCEPTION TO ITS EARLY USE AND FOR ITS LATER USE SUB STITUTE A DEMURRER IN NAME FOR WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DEMURRER IN EFFECT IN THIS STATE EXCEPTIONS FOR INSUFFICIENCY ARE ABOLISHED BY THE NEW CODE AND A MOTION TO STRIKE OUT IS SUBSITUTED THEREFOR11 THIS WOULD SEEM TO ALLOW A VERY FLEXIBLE AND INFORMAL PRACTICE ENTIRELY IN KEEPING WITH THE PURPOSES OF EQUITY BUT EVEN WHERE SUCH A SIMPLE PRACTICE IS POSSIBLE A CASE HAS RECENTLY BEEN DECIDED IN WHICH A DEMURRER WAS FILED TO THE ANSWER12 NO OBJECTION HOWEVER WAS MADE TO IT IN THE LOWER COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS CONSIDERED IT A SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW CODE IN A WORD THE DEMURRER WAS TREATED AS A MOTION TO STRIKE OUT EVIDENTLY A DEMURRER TO AN ANSWER IS TO BE REGARDED IN THE SAME MANNER UNDER THE NEW CODE THAT IT WAS UNDER THE OLD13 BOTH OF WHICH ARE SPLENDID EXAMPLES OF THE MAXIM EQUITY LOOKS TO THE SUBSTANCE RATHER THAN THE FORM B D A BURGE V BURNS SUPRA 21 C J 487 489  569 573 B O BURGE V BURNS

SONS WIFE AND CHILDREN THE PURPOSE BE ING AS DECLARED BY THE TESTATOR TO PROVIDE FOR THE FAMILY DURING THE LIFE OF HIS SON AND HIS WIFE AND THE SURVIVOR OF THEM AND AT THE DEATH OF THE LAST SURVIVOR TO DIVIDE THE TRUST FUND AMONG THEIR DESCENDANTS BY STOCKS IT THUS APPEARS IN PLAIN AND UNMISTAKABLE LANGUAGE THAT THE TRUST FUND IS TO REMAIN UNDIVIDED DURING THE JOINT LIVES OF THE SON AND HIS WIFE AND THE SURVIVOR OF THEM AND DURING THAT PERIOD IT IS TO BE ADMINISTERED FOR THE JOINT USE AND BENEFIT OF THE SON AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR CHILDREN IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED BY THE AUTHORITIES THAT THE

BY JUDGE BUCHANAN IN WARING V WVARING 96 VA 641 32 S E 150 THE WORD CHILDREN HAS A DEFINITE LEGAL SIGNIFICATION AND WHERE NO OTHER WORDS ARE JOINED WITH IT IT HAS IN GENERAL NO OTHER MEANING BUT ISSUE IN THE FIRST DEGREE IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE CONSTRUED TO MEAN LINEAL DESCENDANTS OF A MORE REMOTE DEGREE THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ON THE FACE OF THE WILL TO SHOW THAT IT WAS SO INTENDED FOR NO RULE IS BETTER SETTLED THAN THAT TECHNICAL WORDS ARE PRESUMED TO BE USED TECHNICALLY AND THAT WORDS OF A DEFINITE LEGAL SIGNIFICATION ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS USED IN THEIR DEFINITE LEGAL SENSE UNLESS THE

RATHER STRENGTHENS THE618 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER NOV ORDINARY CONSTRUCTION GIVEN TO THE WORD CHILDREN FOR IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF THE FIFTH CLAUSE THE TESTATOR DECLARES THAT THE SHARE FALL ING TO HIS SON SHALL BE HELD IN TRUST FOR THE JOINT USE AND BENEFIT OF HIS SON AND WIFE AND CHILDREN WHILE IN THE NEXT SUCCEEDING CLAUSE WHEN HE GOES TO DEAL WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TRUST FUND AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS SON AND WIFE HE DIRECTS THAT IT SHALL BE DIVIDED AMONG THEIR DESCENDANTS BY STOCKS THIS CONSTRUCTION IS IN HARMONY WITH THE OPINION IN NEILSON V BRETT SUPRA NOR DO WE THINK THAT THE INFANT SON OF EVERETT DONAGHE DECEASED CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE INCOME OF THE TRUST FUND UNDER THE FIFTH CLAUSE AS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY OF W W DONAGHE JR DECEASED IT IS TRUE THAT THE WORD FAMILY HAS A VARIETY OF MEANINGS AND APPLICATIONS WHICH MAY INCLUDE AN ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD ALL DESCENDED FROM A COMMON STOCK THEIR HUSBANDS AND WIVES PIGG V CLARKE 3 CH D 672 WHEN ONE SPEAKS OF A WIFE AND FAMILY HE MEANS HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN PHILLIPS V FERGUSON 85 VA 509 8 S E 241 1 L R A 837 17 AM ST REP 78 BUT IT WOULD BE A VERY ELASTIC DEFINITION WHICH WOULD EMBRACE THE INFANT SON OF EVERETT DONAGHE WHO REMOVED TO THE STATE OF COLORADO AND WAS MARRIED AND WHERE HIS INFANT CHILD WAS BORN AND HAS SINCE RESIDED WHAT WE HAVE SAID OF COURSE APPLIES ONLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE GRANDCHILD AS THE HEIR AT LAW OF HIS FATHER TO SHARE IN THE TRUST FUND UNTIL THE PERIOD OF DISTRIBUTION ARRIVES AND IS NOT INTENDED TO PREJU DICE WHATEVER INTEREST HE MAY HAVE IN THE CORPUS OF THE ESTATE WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE CIRCUIT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE INFANT SON OF EVERETT DONAGLHE WAS ENTITLED TO ONETHIRD OF THE INCOME ARISING FROM THE TRUST FUND CREATED UNDER THE FIFTH CLAUSE OF THE WILL FOR THE FOREGOING

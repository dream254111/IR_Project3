VIRGIINIA LAW REGISTER Nov 2 WILLsConstructionChildrenWife and Family The word children has in geieral no other meaning but issue of the first degree unless there be something on the face of the

Augusta county pronounced June 6 1903 in a suit in chancery pending in said court in which suit appellants and appellee filed their respective petitions asserting claims to the fund in controversy Reversed The opinion states the case Ker f Kerr for the appellants H J Taylor and R P Bell for the appellee KEITH P delivered the opinion of the court The decree appealed from in this case construes the will of W W iDonagle Sr who died in 1873 leaving considerable estate By the fifth clause of his will he directed that the share falling to my son William W Donaghe shall be held by my executors in trust for the joint use and benefit of my said son and wife and children it being my purpose to provide a home for the family during the life of my said son and his wife and the survivor of them and at the death of the last survivor to divide the trust fund among their descendants by stocks It is my desire that my executors as trustees of this fund shall have the largest discretion as to the investment of the principal from time to time and as to the application of the income or the use of the property having iin view always the preservation of the principal fund in such manner as in their judgment will best promote the comfort respectability and happiness of my said son and his family At the date of the testators death in February 1873 the family of William W Donaghe Jr consisted of himself wife and four infant children all of whom were living with him except his daughter Ellie Of this family as thus composed there now sur vive Lucy J M Donaghe the widow of W W Donaghe Jr and Ellie Anna Gray Donaghe married a Mr Snow removed to Wash ington and died intestate and without issue Everett Donaghe the only son of W W Donaghe Jr removed to1903 BRETT V DONAGHE 617 Colorado married and died some years ago leaving a widow and infant to survive him His widow has since married and his child still survives Mary D Donaghe married one Mahlo from whom she was divorced a vinculo and subsequently married one Edward S Gaunt of the state of New York Mary has since died without issue leav ing a will by which she bequeathed her whole estate including what was due and to become due under the will of W W Donaghe Sr her grandfather to one Kate C Neilson The interest acquired by Kate C Neilson under the will of Mary B Gaunt was ascertained and determined in the case of Neilson v Brett reported in 99 Va 673 40 S E 32 It was seen that by the fifth clause of the will the share falling to W W Donaghe Jr is to be held by the executors in trust for the joint use of his son and his sons wife and children the purpose be ing as declared by the testator to provide for the family during the life of his son and his wife and the survivor of them and at the death of the last survivor to divide the trust fund among their descendants by stocks It thus appears in plain and unmistakable language that the trust fund is to remain undivided during the joint lives of the son and his wife and the survivor of them and during that period it is to be administered for the joint use and benefit of the son and his wife and their children It is well established by the authorities that the word children has in general no other meaning but issue in the first degree unless there be something on the face of the will to manifest a contrary intention on the part of the testator As was said by Judge Buchanan in Waring v WVaring 96 Va 641 32 S E 150 The word children has a definite legal signification and where no other words are joined with it it has in general no other meaning but issue in the first degree In order that it may be construed to mean lineal descendants of a more remote degree there must be something on the face of the will to show that it was so intended for no rule is better settled than that technical words are presumed to be used technically and that words of a definite legal signification are to be understood as used in their definite legal sense unless the contrary appears on the face of the instrument Moon v Siones Exr 19 Gratt 130 Jarman on Wills p 156 There is nothing upon the face of this will which manifests a contrary intent Indeed the context rather strengthens the618 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Nov ordinary construction given to the word children for in the first sentence of the fifth clause the testator declares that the share fall ing to his son shall be held in trust for the joint use and benefit of his son and wife and children while in the next succeeding clause when he goes to deal with the distribution of the trust fund after the death of his son and wife he directs that it shall be divided among their descendants by stocks This construction is in harmony with the opinion in Neilson v Brett supra Nor do we think that the infant son of Everett Donaghe deceased can participate in the income of the trust fund under the fifth clause as a member of the family of W W Donaghe Jr deceased It is true that the word family has a variety of meanings and applications which may include an entire household all descended from a common stock their husbands and wives Pigg v Clarke 3 Ch D 672 When one speaks of a wife and family he means his wife and children Phillips v Ferguson 85 Va 509 8 S E 241 1 L R A 837 17 Am St Rep 78 but it would be a very elastic definition which would embrace the infant son of Everett Donaghe who removed to the state of Colorado and was married and where his infant child was born and has since resided What we have said of course applies only to the right of the grandchild as the heir at law of his father to share in the trust fund until the period of distribution arrives and is not intended to preju dice whatever interest he may have in the corpus of the estate We are of opinion that the Circuit Court erred in holding that the infant son of Everett Donaglhe was entitled to onethird of the income arising from the trust fund created under the fifth clause of the will For the foregoing reasons the decree of the Circuit Court of Augusta county must be reversed Reversed

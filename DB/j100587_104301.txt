BONES OF LIVING ANIMALS OF A RED COLOUR BY M DU HAMEL DU MONCEAU F R S C COMMUNICATED IN A LETTER TO SIR HANS SLOANE BART PR R S TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH BY T S M D F R S IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1737 N S MONSIEUR GEOFFROY COMMUNICATED TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT PARIS THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATION EXTRACTED FROM A LETTER OF SIR HANS SLOANE BART PRE SIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON TO HIM  MR BELCHIER A SURGEON AND MEMBER OF THAT  SOCIETY DINING ONE DAY WITH A CALLICOEPRINTER  REMARKED THAT IN A LEG OF FRESH PORK THE FLESH OF  WHICH WAS WELLTASTED THE BONES WERE RED HE  ASKED THE CAUSE OF SO SINGULAR A THING AND WAS  TOLD THAT THESE CALLICOEPRINTERS MAKE USE OF THE  RUBIA TINCTORUM OR MADDERROOT TO FIX THE CO  LOURS PRINTED ON THE CLOTH SOME OF THESE COLOURS  ARE MADE WITH PREPARATIONS FROM IRON OTHERS WITH  A MIXTURE OF ALUM AND SUGAR OF LEAD THE PARTS  PRINTED WITH THE PREPARATION OF IRON PRODUCE  BLACK AND PURPLE THOSE PRINTED WITH THE MIXTURE  OF ALUM RED OF DIFFERENT DEGREES THESE CAL  LICOES ARE AFTERWARDS BOILED IN A COPPER WITH BRAN  IN ORDER TO CLEAN THEM FROM A DIRTY RED COLOUR  OCCASIONED BY AN INFUSION OF MADDERROOT IN  FINE THAT THIS BRAN SHOULD NOT BE LOST THOUGH  CHARGED391  CHARGED WITH A RED COLOUR IT IS MIXED WITH THE  USUAL FOOD OF THESE HOGS AND THIS IS WHAT PRO  DUCES THIS EFFECT ON THEIR BONES WITHOUT CAUSING  THE LEAST ALTERATION EITHER IN THE FLESH MEMBRANES  CARTILAGES OR ANY OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY MR  BELCHIER WHOSE OBSERVATION HERE RELATED HAS BEEN  COMMUNICATED TO THE PUBLIC IN NO 442 AND 443  OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS DESIRING TO BE  ASSURED WHETHER THE MADDER ALONE OR ALL THE IN  GREDIENTS BLENDED TOGETHER PRODUCED THIS COLOUR  IN THE BONES MADE SOME OTHER EXPERIMENTS  HE MIXED SOME OF THE MADDERROOT WITH THE  FOOD WITH WHICH HE INTENDED TO FEED A COCK  THE COCK DYING WITHIN 16 DAYS AFTER HIS FIRST  FEEDING ON THE MADDER HE DISSECTED HIM AND WAS  SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE ROOT HAD PRODUCED ITS  EFFECT IN SO SMALL A TIME FOR HE FOUND THE BONES  UNIVERSALLY OF A RED COLOUR WHENCE HE CON  CLUDES THAT THE MADDER ALONE CAUSES THIS ALTERA  TION AS HE HAD NOT MIXED EITHER THE IRON ALUM  OR ANY OF THE OTHER INGREDIENTS OF THE DYER WITH  THE COCKS FOOD HE REMARKED THAT THE RED CO  LOUR PENETRATED INTO THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE BONES  AND THAT THE HARDEST BONES TOOK MORE OF THIS CO  LOUR THAN THE SOFTER ONES EXCEPTING THE ENAMELED  PART OF THE TEETH WHICH IN THE HOG RETAINED ITS  WHITENESS MR BELCHIER PROMISES AT THE CLOSE OF HIS OBSER VATION TO TRY FURTHER EXPERIMENTS IN ORDER TO KNOW WITH CERTAINTY WHY THIS CHANGE OF COLOUR TAKES PLACE ONLY IN THE BONES BUT AS HE HAS NOT PUBLISHED ANY THING MORE THAN WHAT I HAVE ABOVE RELATED I THINK MYSELF AT LIBERTY TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC THE392 THE EXPERIMENTS I BEGAN TO MAKE IN THE COUNTRY SOON AFTER THE OBSERVATION CAME TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY ARE A CONFIRMATION OF IT AND DIMINISH NOTHING OF THE MERIT OF THE FIRST DISCOVERY IT IS PROPER TO OBSERVE THAT MIZALDUS IN A WORK PUBLISHED IN 1566 WITH THIS TITLE MEMORABILIUM UTILIUM AC JUCUNDORUM CENTURIAE NOVEM CENT 7 NO HAS THESE WORDS  ERYTHRODANUM VULGO  RUBIA TINCTORUM DICTUM OSSA PECUDUM RUBENTI   SANDYCINO COLORE IMBUIT SI DIES ALIQUOT ILLUD  DEPASTAE SINT OVES ETIAM INTACTA RADICE QUAE RUTILA  EXISTIT C FIRST I TOOK FOUR STRONG PULLETS WHICH I SHUT UP IN COOPS I FED THEM WITH A PASTE MADE OF WHEAT MEAL AND POWDER OF MADDERROOT AND GAVE THEM AN INFUSION OF THE SAME ROOT TO DRINK WHICH I WAS IN HOPES THEY WOULD HAVE NO DISLIKE TO THE FIRST DAYS THEY EAT THEIR PASTE PRETTY WELL BUT I FOUND THAT THE ADDITION OF THE MADDER RENDERED IT MUCH LESS AGREEABLE TO THEM THAN THAT MADE OF THE MEAL ALONE ON WHICH THEY FELL WILL MUCH GREATER EAGERNESS THAN ON THE OTHER WHEN TO TRY THEIR RELISH I NOWAND THEN GAVE THEM SOME OF IT AS TO THE INFUSION OF THE RUBIA TINCTORUM THEY NEVER WOULD DRINK IT AND I WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE THEM PURE WATER WHICH THEY DRANK PLENTIFULLY FOR THIS ROOT MADE THEM THIRSTY IN SHORT AT THE END OF SOME DAYS THEY COULD NOT RELISH THE MIXTURE OF WHICH THEY EAT BUT VERY LITTLE AND WASTED AWAY VISIBLY ON THE 10TH DAY ONE OF THEM DIED AND ANOTHER TWO DAYS AFTER AND BOTH OF THEM HAD THEIR BONES TINGED OF A ROSECOLOUR IN ORDER TO PROLONG THE LIVES OF THE OTHER TWO I DIMINISHED THE DOSE OF THE393 THE MADDER AND FROM TIME TO TIME I GAVE THEM THE PASTE WITHOUT IT THE ROOT HAD ALREADY PRODUCED ITS EFFECT FOR NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEW REGIMEN THEY CONTINUED TO WASTE WHICH OBLIGED ME TO KILL THE THIRD FIVE DAYS AFTER THE DEATH OF THE FIRST TWO THE COLOUR OF ITS BONES WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE TWO WHO DIED FIVE DAYS BEFORE AS TO THE FOURTH PULLET WHICH SEEMED NOT QUITE SO SICK I OTHERS WERE FED WITH THE MEAL AND MADDER MIXEDOTHERS WERE

THE MEAL AND MADDER MIXEOTHERS WERE FED WITH THE MEAL AND MADDER MIXED AND394 AND MADE INTO PELLETS OF A CONVENIENT SIZE GIVEN THEM THREE TIMES A DAY TILL THEIR CROPS WERE FULL I ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE THE YOUNG PIGEONS DRINK OF THE INFUSION OF MADDER WHICH WERE FED WITH THE ROOT AND MEAL BUT I COULD NEVER SUCCEED AND WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE THEM WATER ALONE AS TO THE PULLETS OF THE FIRST EXPERIMENT THE TWO YOUNG PIGEONS FED WITH THE MEAL ALONE WERE LIVELY AND FAT DIGESTED THEIR FOOD AND THROVE AS WELL AS IF FED BY THE OLD ONES BUT ON THE CONTRARY THOSE THAT WERE FED WITH THE PASTE OF MEAL AND MADDER TOOK THIS FOOD ONLY BY FORCE DIGESTED ILL WERE DULL AND VERY THIRSTY AND THOUGH CARE WAS TAKEN TO KEEP THEIR CROP CON STANTLY FULL AS WELL AS THE OTHERS YET THEY GREW LEANER DAILY THEY WERE ALWAYS SHIVERING AND EN DEAVOURING TO GET INTO THE SUN OR NEAR THE FIRE TO WARM THEMSELVES AND THE STRONGEST OF THEM WAS VERY SICK BY THE 10TH DAY I GOT THE TWO KILLED THAT HAD FED ON THE MEAL ALONE AS WELL AS THE OTHERS THAT HAD THE MADDER GIVEN THEM AND I PRESERVED BUT TWO WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO HAVE BETTER BORNE THE EFFECT OF IT THAN THE REST AND HAD THE BONES OF THE WINGS ALREADY TINGED RED ONE OF THE TWO WAS INTENDED TO BE RECOVERD BY A SIMPLE DIET IN ORDER TO SEE IF BY PROLONGING ITS LIFE THE COLOUR WHICH WAS ALREADY VERY VISIBLE IN THE WINGBONES WOULD WEAR OFF BUT IN THREE DAYS TIME IT WAS KILLED ACCIDENTALLY HOWEVER I THOUGHT I PERCEIVED THE COLOUR WEAKER THAN BEFORE THE CHANGE OF DIET AND THE SAME EXPERIMENT REPEATED SOME TIME AFTER CONFIRMED ME IN THE NOTION THAT THE CHANGE OF FOOD MAKES THE COLOUR DISAPPEAR BY DEGREES I CONTINUED TO FEED THE OTHER REMAINING YOUNG395 YOUNG PIGEON WITH MADDER BUT IN SMALL QUANTITIES FOR FEAR OF KILLING IT TOO SOON IT LIVED EIGHT DAYS LONGER WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF THE BONES BEING DEEPER COLOURED THAN THE FIRST THAT WERE KILLED ALL THESE CREATURES THAT HAD BEEN FED WITH THE MIXTURE WERE DISSECTED AND I MADE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS ON THEM NEITHER THE FEATHERS THE HORN OF THE BILL NOR CLAWS HAD CHANGED THEIR COLOUR EVEN WHERE THEY ARE INSERTED INTO THE SKIN THE SKIN OF THE WHOLE BODY HAD PRESERVED ITS NATURAL COLOUR THE BRAIN NERVES MUSCLES TENDONS CARTILAGES EPIPHYSES AND MEMBRANES AFFORDED NOTHING TO THE SIGHT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF THESE PARTS BUT THE LONG BONY TENDONS THAT RUN ALONG THE GREAT BONE WHICH IS IMPROPERLY CALLED THE LEG OF FOWLS WERE RED ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THEIR LENGTH WHICH IS THEIR HARDEST PART ALL THE TRUE BONES EVEN TO THE VERY THINNEST OF THEM WERE AS RED AS CARMINE AND IN SOME PLACES THIS RED WAS SO DEEP THAT THEY APPEARED ALMOST BLACK IN THESE YOUNG BIRDS ALL THE BONES DO NOT TAKE THE RED TINGE ALIKE THE HARDEST ARE GENERALLY MORE COLOURED THAN THOSE THAT ARE TENDERER A DIFFERENCE OF THIS KIND IS PERCEIVABLE EVEN IN THE SAME BONE FOR THE MIDDLE WHICH HAS MORE SOLIDITY THAN THE ENDS IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE REDDEST NOT BUT THERE ARE SOMETIMES FOUND LITTLE PALE SPOTS IN THE PART WHERE THE RED IS DEEPEST AND SOMETIMES SPOTS OF A VERY DEEP RED IN THOSE PARTS WHICH HAVE TAKEN BUT A CARNATION TINGE I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT THE GREAT BONE OF THE FOOT WHICH IS COMMONLY CALLED THE BONE OF THE E E E LEG396 LEG WAS VISIBLY LESS RED THAN THE OTHERS I HAVE FOUND THE LITTLE BONES OF THE LARYNX AND OF THE APOPHYSES TINGED OF A FINE RED THOUGH THESE ARE AS SMALL AS A THREAD IN YOUNG PIGEONS THE RINGS OF THE TRACHEA WHICH ARE INTIRELY CARTILAGINOUS HAD NOT TAKEN THE LEAST TINGE BUT THE RING NEAREST THE DIVISION OF THE TRACHEA WAS RED IN THESE PIGEONS AND EVEN THE FIRST RING OF EACH BRANCH OF THE BIFUR CATION HAD IN SEVERAL TAKEN THE TINCTURE IN THE MID DLE AT LEAST OF ITS OUTSIDE THE OTHER PARTS OF THE THORAX VIZ THE HEART LUNGS MEDIASTINUM PLEURA AND DIAPHRAGM RE MAINED OF THEIR NATURAL COLOUR THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE IN THE LIVER SPLEEN KIDNEYS NOR ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE GIZZARD BUT THE INNER MEMBRANE OF THE CROP AND INTESTINES ESPECIALLY THE LARGE ONES APPEARED RED HAVING WASHED PIECES OF THESE CROPS AND INTESTINES I FOUND THAT THEIR OUTER MEMBRANE CONTINUED WHITE AND THAT THE INNER OR TUNICA VIL LOSA ONLY WAS TINGED BY THE MADDER AT FIRST SIGHT IT APPEARED TO ME AS IF INJECTED BUT UPON EXAMINING IT WITH A GLASS I SAW DISTINCTLY THAT IT WAS NOT A COLOURED LIQUOR THAT WAS CONTAINED IN VESSELS AS IN PARTS INJECTED BUT THAT IT WAS ONLY A SORT OF FAECULA DETAINED IN THE VILLOSE PART OF THESE MEMBRANES IT IS DOUBTLESS THE ADHESION OF THESE TINGING PARTICLES OF THE ROOT TO THE SMALL VILLI OF THE INNER MEMBRANES OF THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION THAT IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THE DISTEMPERS WITH WHICH THESE CREATURES APPEARED TO BE SEIZED WHILE I FED THEM WITH THE MADDER THEIR CROP ESPECIALLY WAS RELAXED AND FLABBY AS IF IT HAD BEEN MACERATED SEVERAL MONTHS IN WATER IT WAS EASILY TORN AND ITS INNER OR VILLOSE MEMBRANE AD397 ADHERED SO LITTLE TO THE OTHERS THAT IT WAS DETACHED FROM THEM IN PIECES IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT THE COLOURED FAECULA DETACHED FROM THE MADDER THAT IS THE PART OF THE ROOT WHICH GIVES THE TINCTURE HAD OBSTRUCTED THE SMALL VESSELS AND GLANDS OF THE STO MACH WHICH MIGHT POSSIBLY OCCASION A SPHACELUS THEREIN HOWEVER THAT BE A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF THIS FAECULA BEING ACCUMULATED THERE RETARDED DI GESTION AND THOSE ANIMALS DIED HECTIC THOUGH WITH A FULL STOMACH THE EYES OF THESE ANIMALS WHILE ALIVE SEEMED AS RED AS THOSE OF SOME PARROTS I THOUGHT AFTER HAVING DISSECTED THEM THAT NO OTHER PART WAS CO LOURED BUT THE CAPSULA OF THE CRYSTALLINE BUT MON SIEUR MORAND TO WHOM I HAD SENT A TURKEY FED WITH THE MADDER OBSERVED THAT THE VITREOUS CAPSULA WAS OF A CRIMSON RED THOUGH NEITHER THE VITREOUS HU MOUR NOR THE CRYSTALLINE WERE DYED THE EYE OF THIS TURKEY BEING LARGER THAN THOSE OF THE PIGEONS THE HAND THAT DISSECTED IT MUCH MORE DEXTEROUS THAN MINE AND THE ANATOMIST MORE KNOWING I WILLINGLY COME INTO HIS OPINION THIS THEN IS THE ONLY SOFT PART THAT IS REALLY TINGED IN THESE ANIMALS FOR I DO NOT LOOK ON THOSE PARTS AS SUCH WHICH APPEAR SO ONLY BY THEIR IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH THOSE PARTS THAT ARE CHARGED WITH THE COLOUR MONSIEUR MORAND HAVING IN THE NOTES HE SENT ME OF HIS OBSERVATIONS CON FIRMED ALL THAT I HAD BEFORE OBSERVED THERE OUGHT TO REMAIN NO DOUBT OF WHAT I HAVE HERE RELATED I COME TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE SKELETONS AND OF ALL THE COLOURED OSSEOUS PARTS OF MY PIGEONS IN ORDER TO COMPARE THEM WITH THE SKELETONS OF THE TWO PIGEONS FED WITH WHEATMEAL ALONE WITHOUT E E E 2 THE398 THE MADDER THE BONES OF THE FIRST WERE AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE OF A VERY LIVELY CARMINERED IN SOME PLACES OF A CRIMSON AND I HAVE SOME OF THEM OF THE COLOUR OF YELLOW OKRE BUT WHENCE THIS DIF FERENCE AROSE I COULD NOT DISCOVER THESE TINGED BONES BEING BROKE WHILE FRESH OR BEFORE DRYING IN THE AIR SEEMED TO ME SOMEWHAT BIGGER AND FULLER OF MARROW BUT ALSO MORE SPONGY OR OF A LOOSER TEXTURE AND EASIER TO BREAK THAN THE WHITE BONES OF THE PIGEONS FED WITH MEAL ONLY THE PARTS OF THESE BONES THAT HAD THE LEAST DEGREE OF HARDNESS BROKE BETWEEN THE FINGERS WHICH REMAINED COLOURED FROM THEM AND THIS TINCTURE DOES NOT COME FROM THE MARROW WHICH CONTINUES IN ITS NATURAL STATE LIKE ALL THE OTHER SOFT PARTS THE SAME PARTS IN THE WHITE BONES WERE NOT TO BE BROKE IN THIS MANNER IF WE RECOLLECT THAT THE PIGEONS FED WITH THE MIXTURE OF MEAL AND MADDER ARE ALWAYS IN A LAN GUISHING CONDITION IN A CONTINUAL DECAY IT WILL BE EASY TO JUDGE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHY THE RED BONES MUST BE NOT SO WELL FORMED NOR SO HARD AS THE WHITE BONES OF THE PIGEONS FED WITH GOOD ALIMENTS BUT WHY ARE THEY BIGGER AND AS IT WERE PUFFED UP IT IS HARD TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE OF THIS BUT THE INTERPOSITION OF THE COLOURING FAECULA OF THE MADDER BETWEEN THE LAMELLAE OF THE BONES THESE HETEROGENEOUS PARTICLES HINDER THE IMMEDIATE CONTACT OF THESE LAMELLAE AND THENCE PROCEEDS THE PRETERNATURAL INCREASE OF THEIR SIZE AND THEIR LITTLE SOLIDITY UPON VIEWING THESE BONES WITH A GOOD GLASS THEIR SMOOTHEST SURFACE APPEARS BORED WITH A VAST NUMBER OF SMALL HOLES IN WHICH THE COLOURING FAECULA IS PERCEIVED AND WITH A MICROSCOPE THAT MAG399 MAGNIFIES STILL MORE THERE APPEARS A SORT OF NETWORK OF FIBRES WHICH DIVIDE AND REUNITE TO FORM THIS NET UNDER THE FIRST ORDER OF THIS NETWORK WHICH AP PEARS WHITE ANOTHER IS SEEN SOMEWHAT RED AND UNDER THIS A THIRD AND A FOURTH STILL DEEPER COLOURED IN FINE THE GROUND UNDER ALL THESE RETICULAR STRATA IS OF A VERY DEEP RED AND THE WHOLE MAY BE JUSTLY ENOUGH COMPARED TO A PIECE OF WOOD STRIPPED OF ITS BARK IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS SORT OF INJECTION MADE BY THE WAY OF DIGESTION MIGHT LEAD AN ABLE ANA TOMIST TO SOME VERY USEFUL DISCOVERIES ON THE NA TURE AND FORMATION OF THE BONES NAY I THINK I HAVE ALREADY FOUND OUT SOMETHING NEW ON THIS HEAD BUT AS I HAVE STILL SOME SCRUPLE REMAINING ON MY OBSERVATIONS I WILL NOT VENTURE TO COMMUNICATE THE CONSEQUENCES DRAWN FROM THEM IN ORDER THAT THE MADDER SHOULD PRODUCE THE ABOVE RELATED EFFECT ON THE BONES ITS TINCTURE MUST HAVE SUCH A DEGREE OF FIXITY ACCORDING TO THE DYERS TERM AS NOT TO BE CHANGED BY THE DISSOLVING ACTION OF THE SALIVA OF THE JUICE OF THE STOMACH OF THE PANCREATIC JUICE OF THE BILE C NOR BY THE PERI STALTIC MOTION OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES AND YET THESE JUICES ACT SO POWERFULLY ON COMMON ALIMENTS THAT AFTER DIGESTION THEY ARE NOT TO BE KNOWN EITHER BY THEIR SMELL TASTE OR COLOUR THIS IS NOT ALL THESE COLOURING PARTICLES MUST BE SMALL ENOUGH TO PASS WITH THE CHYLE INTO THE BLOOD AND CIRCULATE WITH IT THROUGH A GREAT NUMBER OF STRAINERS OR VESSELS WITHOUT BEING SEPARATED AND WITHOUT BEING DEPOSITED EITHER IN THE LIVER SPLEEN OR PANCREAS I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT PORTION OF THE LYMPH OF THE BLOOD WHICH IS FIT FOR NOURISHING THE BONES MIGHT BE400 BE THE TRUE DISSOLVENT OF THE TINCTURE OF THE MADDER AND MIGHT CONVEY IT TO THE PLACE WHITHER IT CARRIES NOURISHMENT TO THE SOLID PARTS OF THE BODY OF THESE ANIMALS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS CONJECTURE WHICH I SHALL RESUME IN THE SEQUEL I THOUGHT THAT THE SKE LETONS OF YOUNG ANIMALS OUGHT TO TAKE A STRONGER AND QUICKER TINCTURE THAN THOSE OF FULLGROWN ANIMALS BECAUSE THE BONES OF YOUNG ANIMALS ARE IN A STATE OF GROWTH WHICH REQUIRES A GREATER QUANTITY OF OSSEOUS JUICE IT IS LIKEWISE TRUE AS ABOVE SAID THAT IT IS THE HARDEST BONES OF YOUNG ANIMALS THAT IMBIBE MOST OF THE COLOUR ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS GAVE RISE TO A DIFFICULTY WHICH WAS TO BE CLEARED UP WHEREFORE IN THE BEGINNING OF LAST OCTOBER I CHOSE TWO TURKEYS OF THE YEAR THE STRONGEST I COULD FIND AND YOUNG PIGEONS IN THEIR FIRST HAIR OR DOWN I COULD WISH TO HAVE MADE THE EXPERIMENT ON ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES BUT IT WAS IMPOS SIBLE TO FIND YOUNG TURKEYS IN THEIR FIRST DOWN AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND BESIDES THESE ANI MALS BEING EXTREMELY TENDER DURING THE FIRST MONTHS THEIR STOMACH WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BEAR THE EFFECT OF THE MADDER AS TO OLD PIGEONS I HAD NO TAME ONES THE WILD ARE DIFFICULT TO BE FED WITH THE PASTE AND IF THEY WERE SUFFERED TO FEED AT DISCRETION THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY MADDERED IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THIS EXPRESSION HOWEVER THE BONES OF MY TWO TURKEYS WERE VERY HARD IN COMPARISON OF THOSE OF THE YOUNG PIGEONS AND THUS I HAD IN THESE ANIMALS THOUGH OF DIFFERENT KINDS ALL THAT WAS OF IMPORTANCE FOR MY EXPE RIMENT MY401 MY YOUNG PIGEONS FED WITH THE PASTE MIXED WITH MADDER DIED THE THIRD DAY YET ALL THAT HAD THE CONSISTENCE OF BONE IN THEIR SKELETONS WAS BECOME AS RED AS SCARLET MR BELCHIER WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE BONES OF HIS COCK TINGED RED IN SIXTEEN DAYS AND HERE ARE BONES SO COLOURED IN THREE DAYS BUT ALL THAT SHOULD IN COURSE OF TIME HAVE TURNED TO BONE IN ONE OF MY YOUNG PIGEONS AND AS YET WAS BUT CARTILAGE AS THE EPIPHYSES THE GREAT APOPHYSIS OF THE STERNUM C HAD NOT TAKEN THE LEAST COLOUR IN THE OTHER THERE WERE SOME SPOTS OF A VERY WEAK RED ON THE CARTILAGE OF THE STERNUM WHICH PROBABLY BEGAN TO OSSIFY OTHER EXPERIMENTS SINCE TRIED HAVE TAUGHT ME WITH GREATER CERTAINTY THAT THE CAR TILAGES IN GENERAL ARE NOT TINGED RED BY THE MADDER BUT WHEN THEY BEGIN TO ACQUIRE THE CONSISTENCE OF BONE IF AS I SUSPECT IT IS THE LYMPHATIC PART OF THE BLOOD THAT IS THE MENSTRUUM OF THE COLOURING PAR TICLES OF THE MADDER IF THIS LYMPH CONTAINS THE NUTRITIOUS JUICE OF THE CARTILAGES AND BONES WHY DOES IT NOT IN CARRYING WITH IT THE COLOURING PARTICLES IT HAS EXTRACTED FROM THE ROOT WHY DOES IT NOT I SAY TINGE THE CARTILAGES AS WELL AS THE BONES IN MY OPINION THIS DIFFICULTY CANNOT BE SOLVED BUT BY THE DIFFERENCE OF THE PORES IN THE CARTILAGES THEY ARE TOO LARGE THE COLOURING MATTER PASSES THROUGH THEM TOO EASILY AND FINDING NO OSSEOUS LAMINAE YET FORMED FOR WANT OF A SURFACE SUFFICIENTLY EXTENDED TO RETAIN IT IT PASSES WITH THE SUPERABUNDANT LYMPH THROUGH THE PORES OF THE CARTILAGES WHEN THESE CARTILAGES BEGIN TO TAKE A PROPER CONSISTENCE WHERE THERE ARE STRATA OF OSSEOUS LAMINAE ALREADY FORMED THE OB STACLE402 STACLE EXISTS THE COLOURING FAECULA IS DETAINED AND DEPOSITED THERE WHEN THE OSSIFYING JUICE IS NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR REPAIRING A DAILY LOSS OF SUB STANCE AS IN ANIMALS ARRIVED AT THEIR FULL GROWTH BESIDES THAT PROBABLY THIS JUICE IS THEN MUCH LESS ABUNDANT AND CONSEQUENTLY IN PROPORTION LESS CHARGED WITH THE COLOURING PARTS OF THE ROOT IT MUST NECESSARILY RESULT THENCE THAT THE BONES OF AN ADULT ANIMAL WILL BE MUCH WEAKER COLOURED AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TWO TURKEYS WHICH THOUGH FED FOR FIFTEEN DAYS WITH THE PASTE OF MEAL AND MADDER HAD THEIR BONES TINGED BUT OF A ROSE COLOUR WHICH APPEARED TO ME SOMEWHAT DEEPER TOWARDS THE ENDS THAN THE MIDDLE WHICH HAVING TOO MUCH CONSISTENCE COULD NOT ADMIT OR RETAIN THE SAME QUANTITY OF THE COLOURING FAECULA AS THE TENDER BONES OF THE YOUNG PIGEONS THEREFORE THE BONES OF ANIMALS THAT ARE STILL GROWING ARE DYED BETTER AND QUICKER THAN THOSE OF FULLGROWN ANIMALS AND IN MY OPINION FOR THE REASONS ALREADY GIVEN MY TWO TURKEYS HAD THE SAME AILMENTS WITH THE PULLETS OF THE FIRST EXPERIMENT THEY FELL INTO A DECAY LIKE THOSE AND I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE THEM KILLED IN FIFTEEN DAYS TIME HERE WE SEE YOUNG PIGEONS WHOSE BONES WERE DYED OF A FINE CARMINERED IN THREE DAYS WHICH IS NEARLY THE TIME THEY MUST HAVE FOR ACQUIRING THIS DEGREE OF TINCTURE BY OTHER EXPERIMENTS ON YOUNG PIGEONS OF THE SAME AGE I HAVE FOUND THAT IN THIRTY SIX HOURS THEIR BONES WERE OF A LIVELY ROSECOLOUR AND IN TWENTYFOUR HOURS THEY WERE AT LEAST OF A FLESH COLOUR THESE403 THESE LAST EXPERIMENTS PROVE WITH WHAT EXPEDITION THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NUTRITIOUS JUICE IS PERFORMED IN ANIMALS OF THIS KIND WHICH ACQUIRE ALL THEIR GROWTH IN A FEW MONTHS AND HOW RAPID THE DISTRI BUTION IS EVEN IN THOSE PARTS WHERE THE BLOODS CIR CULATION MEETS WITH THE GREATEST OBSTACLE AS IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BONES AS ONE OUGHT LIKEWISE TO INFER FROM THESE EXPERI MENTS THAT THERE ARE VEGETABLE MEDICINES WHOSE CHIEF TENDENCY IS TO THE BONES AND WHICH CONSE QUENTLY MIGHT REMEDY MANY OF THEIR DISTEMPERS I LOOKED ON MYSELF OBLIGED TO EMPLOY THE MADDER WITH THIS VIEW BUT NOT HAVING IT IN MY POWER TO RAISE DISEASES OF DIFFERENT KINDS IN THE BONES OF MY ANIMALS I CONSINED MYSELF TO THE EXAMINATION OF WHAT EFFECT IT WOULD HAVE IN A FRACTURE I CHOSE FOUR VERY VIGOROUS YOUNG PIGEONS A THIGHBONE OF EACH OF THEM WAS BROKE THE RE DUCTION WAS IMMEDIATELY PERFORMED AND SECURED BY A PROPER BANDAGE TWO OF THESE PIGEONS WERE FED WITH THE MEAL AND MADDER AND THE OTHER TWO WITH THE MEAL ALONE THESE LAST NOTWITHSTANDING THE PAIN THE FRACTURE MUST HAVE GIVEN THEM HAD ALWAYS A GOOD APPETITE AND IN EIGHT DAYS THEY BEGAN TO WALK WITH THEIR DRESSING WHICH WAS A LITTLE LOOSENED THE OTHERS FELL INTO THE ACCIDENTS ALREADY MENTIONED AND DIED ONE ON THE TENTH THE OTHER ON THE FOUR TEENTH DAY THE TWO PIGEONS THAT HAD RECOVERED WERE KILLED IN ORDER TO COMPARE THE CALLUS THAT OF THE PIGEONS WHICH HAD NOT TAKEN ANY MADDER WAS LITTLE CLOSE AND VERY EVEN THAT OF THOSE FED WITH THIS ROOT WAS LARGE SPONGIOUS AND UNEVEN THERE SHOT OUT OF IT A SORT OF VEGETATION IT F F F BROKE404 BROKE BETWEEN THE FINGERS AND CRUMBLED INTO SMALL GRAINS IT IS TRUE THAT THE STATE OF SUFFERING OF THESE ANIMALS OCCASIONED BY THE HURT AND INCREASED BY A FOOD IMPROPER FOR THEM MIGHT RETARD THE PERFECT REUNION OF THEIR BONES YET I THINK IT CERTAINLY RESULTS FROM THIS EXPERIMENT AND OTHERS WHICH I SUPPRESS BECAUSE THEY PROVE NOTHING MORE THAT THE RUBIA TINCTORUM TAKEN INWARDLY IS RATHER PREJUDI CIAL THAN BENEFICIAL IN THE CASE OF FRACTURES AND IT IS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE TO KNOW WHAT IS TO BE AVOIDED THE RUBIA PROBABLY IS NOT THE ONLY VEGETABLE SUBSTANCE THAT CAN CHANGE THE COLOUR OF THE BONES AND YET I HAVE TRIED THE LOGWOOD THE ANCHUSA AND CURCUMA WITHOUT SUCCESS IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IT MUST BE A SUBSTANCE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE OF ALTERATION AND IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE RUBIA IS OF THAT SORT SEEING THE CLOTHS DYED WITH THIS ROOT BEAR VERY WELL THE ACTION OF THE AIR AND THAT OF BOILING I HAVE PUT THE COLOURED BONES OF MY ANIMALS TO SEVERAL PROOFS FIRST AS MR BELCHIER TO THAT OF BOIL ING WATER AND OF SPIRIT OF WINE WITHOUT THE LEAST CHANGE OF COLOUR IT ALSO RESISTED SOAPSUDS A STRONG LIXIVIUM OF SALT OF TARTAR DISCHARGED A LITTLE OF THE COLOUR AND MADE IT LOOK BRIGHTER VINEGAR MADE IT TAKE A YELLOWISH BROWN AND OBSCURE TINGE IN FINE ALUMWATER DISCHARGED THE COLOUR PRETTY CONSIDERABLY AND THE WATER REMAINED SOMEWHAT VINOUS THUS THESE BONES PERFECTLY WELL RESIST THE SAME BOILINGS AS THE CLOTHS DYED WITH THE SAME ROOT BUT THE AIR ACTS UPON THEM MUCH SOONER THAN ON THESE CLOTHS FOR THE BONES OF THE PULLETS IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT THOSE OF THE TURKEYS IN THE THIRD AND THOSE OF THE YOUNG PIGEONS THAT HAD EAT OF THE MAD405 MADDER BUT THREE DAYS BECAME INTIRELY WHITE IN LESS THAN A YEAR AND THE REDDEST BONES LOST MUCH OF THEIR COLOUR AND I AM OF OPINION THAT THE DEW TO WHICH I HAVE EXPOSED SOME OF THEM FOR A FEW DAYS WILL FINISH THE WHITENING OF THEM AS THERE IS A SORT OF ANALOGY BETWEEN THE NUTRI TION OF ANIMALS AND THAT OF VEGETABLES I HAVE NOT NEGLECTED TRYING IF THE TINCTURE OF THE RUBIA WOULD INTRODUCE ITSELF INTO THE VESSELS OF SOME PLANTS WHICH WOULD PERHAPS CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO LAY OPEN THEIR ORGANIZATION FOR THE FIRST EXPERIMENT IN WHICH INDEED I HAD NO HOPES OF SUCCESS I PLANTED TWO BULBS OF TU BEROSES IN EARTH WITH WHICH I HAD MIXED A GOOD QUANTITY OF MADDER BUT I FOUND NOTHING EITHER IN THE LEAVES STALK OR FLOWERS BUT WHAT WAS IN THE COMMON AND NATURAL STATE AND THIS MUST HAVE BEEN SO FOR SINCE IT IS ONLY THE BONES THAT TAKE THE TINCTURE IN ANIMALS THE TUBEROSE HAVING ALL ITS PARTS SOFT IS IN THE STATE OF AN ANIMAL WITHOUT BONES SUCH AS A LEACH AN EARTHWORM A LAM PREY WHICH WOULD PROBABLY CONTINUE IN THEIR NATURAL STATE WHATEVER QUANTITY OF MADDER WERE GIVEN THEM SUPPOSING IT COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE WHEREFORE I RESOLVED TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT ON A TREE I PLANTED A PARADISE APPLETREE IN A BOX WHICH I HAD FILLED WITH EARTH MIXED WITH A GREAT DEAL OF MADDER AND I COVERED THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE EARTH WITH A LAYER OF MADDER TWO INCHES THICK THIS LAYER WAS RENEWED SEVERAL TIMES FOR NEAR TWO YEARS THAT MY TREE IS UNDER THE EXPERIMENT BUT I HAVE NOT AS YET BEEN ABLE TO EXAMINE IF ITS WOOD IS COLOURED BY THIS ROOT IN CASE THE EXPERIMENT F F F 2 DOES406 DOES NOT SUCCEED AS IT IS VERY LIKELY IT WILL NOT IT WILL SERVE AT LEAST TO EXPOSE THE VANITY AND USELESS NESS OF ALL THOSE RECEIPTS AND PROCESSES OF VEGETATION THAT ARE TO BE FOUND PRINTED IN MIZALDUS PORTA AND OTHER MORE MODERN FOREIGN COMPILERS

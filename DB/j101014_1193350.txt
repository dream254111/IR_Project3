of Politics Princeton University T O understand the events of our times we must see them in true perspective There is one notion that we must discard namely that our existing state constitutions represent constitutional arrangements made by the fathers and having back of them the weight of their authority and influence I think that idea is wrong We have only to consider our polit ical history to find that our state constitutions were simply pro visional arrangements to meet a casual emergency There was no idea that they should be regarded as fixing the type of gov ernment They were a sort of act of settlement to provide some basis for action with the expectation that political expe rience would eventually bring governmental institutions into accord with the needs of the people This thought received strong expression in some early docu uments In the Federalist no 47 Madison remarked I wish not to be regarded as an advocate for the particular organiza tions of the several state governments I am fully aware that among the many excellent principles which they exemplify they carry strong marks of the haste and still stronger of the inexperience under which they are framed And again in the Federalist no 37 he said It may be pronounced with assurance that the people of this country will never be satisfied until some remedy be applied to the vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize the state administrations No I5 of the Federalist is virtually an analysis of the defects and incapacity of state administration and it was just such defects that energized the

of I787 Mercer of Maryland bluntly declared that the real business in hand was to protect the people against those speculating legislatures which are now plundering them throughout the United States Mercers analysis of the situation reported in Madisons Journal for August 14 1787 is remarkable for its prescience He argued that unless the executive is directly connected with the legislature its members will prey upon the people instead of defending the people He said The governments of America will become aristocracies They are so already The public measures are calculated for the benefit of the governors not the people The people are dissatisfied and complain They change their rulers and the public measures are changed but it is only a change of one scheme of emolument to the rulers for another The people gain nothing by it but an addition of instability to their other evils As a remedy Mercer proposed what is now designated as cab inet government He argued that  the executive ought to have a council being members of both Houses The distrust of existing forms of authority was so great at that period that Jefferson then in France felt it as strongly as statesmen at home On December 20 1787 Jefferson wrote to Madison  The instability of our laws is really an immense evil I think it would be well to provide in our constitution that there shall always be a twelvemonth between the engrossing of a bill and the passing of it These citations are typical of two tendencies very marked in our political history Mercers words show that he was looking toward structural order whereas Jefferson looked toward re straint upon details of procedure The latter tendency has so far governed constitutional change in this country Owing to the notion that the way to guard against abuse of power is to multiply checks upon the exercise of power our state con stitutions are schemes of restriction constantly increasing in complexity There has been continual change without im 79 31EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT provement From 1776 to 1909 127 distinct state constitutions have been adopted in this country We have no record from which to get the exact number of amendments but from 1894 to 1904 381 constitutional amendments were proposed of which 217 were adopted The process has had curious results For instance if you examine the constitution of Maryland you will find in the bill of rights a declaration that  for the redress of grievances and for amending and strengthening the laws the legislature ought to be frequently convened But the process of change since has been such that a provision has been in serted prohibiting the legislature from meeting more than once in two years unless specially convoked by the governor Hostility to legislative sessions has become a general char acteristic of our state constitutions There has been a marked movement toward biennial and even quadrennial sessions It is plain that there has been a displacement of the legislature from its normal position as the body representing the people Constitutional provisions exhibit the legislature as being a misrepresentative body against which precautions must be taken When you compare American constitutions with those of other countries you will observe that restrictions upon legislative authority are an American peculiarity European state constitutions assume that the legislative assembly will fulfil its proper functions American constitutions are framed on the assumption that the legislature will misbehave unless sub ject to restraint Another American peculiarity is the expansion of the execu tive negative After every session in New York or Pennsyl vania the governor sits in judgment upon hundreds of enact ments determining which shall be law and which not A similar exaltation of executive prerogative is seen in the action of governors dealing with the appropriation bills In I909 Governor Stuart of Pennsylvania cut 20000000 from the ap propriation bills by his vetoes According to the traditional scheme the governor is the chief executive and it is the function of the representative assembly to control his actions but now instead of depending on the legislatures to control the governors the people depend upon the governors to control the legisla 80 VOL III 32No 2 REORGANIZATION OF STATE GOVERNMENT tures That is a very singular constitutional development without parallel in other countries Another marked feature is the expansion of judicial authority It cannot be understood unless we consider the moral basis as well as the legal basis An abnormal extension of jurisdiction has been forced upon the courts through stress of necessity Consider such a situation as that which existed in Montana after the legislature adjourned in I907 The enactments of the ses sion were so full of mistakes that the official publication made by the secretary of state contained the following notice The within are exact copies of the enrolled laws as the same reached this office and neither this office nor the printer em ployed in the work is responsible for spelling or punctuation One law presumably meant to prevent the sale of diseased meat imposed a severe penalty on the sale of deceased meat Compliance with the law as it stood would have required butchers to supply their customers with live cattle This is an instance of the sort of legislation that compels American judges to do what the judges of no other civilized country have to do namely go behind the language of the act to consider the mo tives and intentions of the legislature the practical result being to substitute judicial discretion for legislative action It is true that the lawmaking power has been virtually transferred from the legislature to the courts but this result is to be im puted to legislative incapacity rather than to judicial arrogance Those who are inclined to attribute to the federal nature of our government the powers over lawmaking exercised by American judges should consider the fact that no such tendency has been developed in Switzerland or Germany Some tendencies ap peared in Germany in that direction and Brinton Coxe in his treatise entitled Y Judicial Power and Unconstitutional Legisla tion collected a number of cases But the courts refrained from courses that American courts have followed not so much because of a difference in the legal situation as because of dif ferences in the moral situation When statutes are known to be a mature and circumspect expression of public opinion judges will hesitate to set up a contrary opinion of their own and in deed the principle has been laid down in the courts of Germany 8i 33VOL II EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT that a constitutional provision is to be understood as a rule for the legislative power to interpret No such attitude of serious opinion could exist in regard to the legislative power in this country as its activities are too crude and irresponsible to com mand respect The abnormal exaltation of judicial authority in America is correlated with an abnormal degradation of legisla tive authority Rectify the legislative situation and the judicial situation will settle itself Efforts to obtain good government by constitutional restraint have about reached their limit and the political philosophy from which they issued is becoming obsolete American con stitutions started at a time when there was a habit of regarding government as a thing distinct and apart from the people so that popular liberty implied limitation of the sphere of govern ment Now government is coming to be regarded simply as an institutional embodiment of the will of the people It is their agency existing for their service so that impairment of its power is an abatement of the sovereignty of the people The people are now demanding a revision of the system of government not to put more checks on the government but to take possession of the government itself Questions of funda mental organization are now engaging consideration This disposition affrights conservative sentiment but while the polit ical mythology usually invoked in opposition to reform does not deserve any respect the anxiety is not baseless It is not true that the system against which radical reformers are in revolt expresses the wisdom of the Fathers but it is true that organic change is a dangerous process History tells us that the mak ing over of constitutions is a process that is apt to draw blood The French Revolution has not lost its importance as a warn ing But by using ones judgment instead of ones imagination to reach conclusions I think it will appear that risks attending the renovation of our state constitutions are closely limited by the essentially municipal nature of state authority No matter what blunders may take place they will result in public loss and inconvenience rather than public disorder It will be a dry revolution and not a wet revolution even at the worst The influences making for a reorganization of state govern 82 34No 2 REORGANIZATION OF STATE GO VERNMEINT ment are now so strong that a change of type is not likely to be deferred for many years The eighteenthcentury doctrine of the separation of powers was at one time as generally applied in city constitutions as it still is in state constitutions It has been overthrown by the introduction of the commission plan of government and the general improvement of municipal government ensuing from the spread of the new model is affecting public opinion as regards state government It would be still more influential were it not that the body in which the commission plan connects the executive and legislative powers is too small for state use But for difficulty on that point attempts might have been made before now to adopt the com mission plan in state government The way in which the com mission plan has directed public attention to the advantages of direct connection between the executive and legislative powers will be fruitful in constitutional results The most significant indication of the tendency of the times is I think the new constitution which the Oregon reformers are endeavoring to introduce by popular initiative In essence it proposes that the governor shall be the general manager of the public business meeting with the representative assembly as with a board of directors He will appoint his cabinet he will have the right to prepare the budget and propose his measures and if his measures are rejected he will have the privilege of submitting them to the direct vote of the people In acquiring these powers he will no longer have the veto power His duty will be to digest and propose measures not to forbid what the legislature may have done His power becomes positive instead of negative Not merely in Oregon but even here in New York the trend of opinion is in the same general direction It hardly seems possible to do anything more to increase the governors power of negative action The next step in order is to give him power of positive action that is to say instead of a power of veto he should have a power of initiative Just such a con stitutional change has already been proposed by Henry L Stimson at one time Republican party candidate for governor of New York and at the present time Secretary of War in 83 35EFFICIENT GO VERNMENT President Tafts cabinet In a speech at Cleveland on Jan 28 19II he said of the governor Give him the same power to select and control his cabinet and the heads of his departments which is possessed by the President of the United States especially with an absolute and unconditional power of removal The same power should be carried through all of the execu tive departments through which is administered the regulative control of our public service corporations and other public utilities Give him the undisputed right not only to suggest but to frame and introduce his own legislative measures giving to such measures a right of pre cedence on the legislative calendar Do away for instance with the spectacle that we have seen too often in New York of measures desired by the governor held up apparently by the action of the clerk of the assembly If the governors power over legislation under such con ditions should prove to be great it could always be checked by the use of an optional popular referendum The shortballot movement makes in the same direction How are you going to shorten the ballot except by treating the governor as a general manager filling subordinate positions by appointment subject to responsibility for results through close connection with the representative assembly It is a familiar business principle that discretion and responsibility go together In acquiring the power to propose and explain his measures directly to the legislature and to bring them to determination it will no longer be necessary for him to use official patronage as a fund with which to bribe the legislature to consider the public business and it will be politically incon venient to make appointments on other grounds than adminis trative efficiency The ideas and influences that I have sketched are yet to receive institutional embodiment but that is simply a question of time If an efficient type of state government appears any where it will spread everywhere Certainly the present situation cannot endure Its evils are not irremediable The forces of progress will find a way out I am sufficiently optimistic to believe that a reorganization of state authority is about to begin that will give the American people that which they have never hadinstitutions of efficient government 84 36

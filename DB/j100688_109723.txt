J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109723,ON THE COMPOSITION OF ZEOLITE ABSTRACT,I207043,396 ON THE COMPOSITION OF ZEOLITE BY JAMES SMITHSON ESQ FRS READ FEBRUARY 7 1811 PHIL TRANS 1811 P 171 ALTHOUGH THE SUBSTANCE CALLED NATROLITE BY MR KLAPROTH HAS LATELY BEEN FOUND UNDER A CRYSTALLINE FORM PERFECTLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF ME SOTYPE M HAIIY HAS NOT THOUGHT HIMSELF WARRANTED FROM THIS CIR CUMSTANCE TO CONSIDER THESE TWO BODIES AS OF THE SAME SPECIES ON ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THEIR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS OF M VAUQUELIN THERE WAS NOT OBSERVED TO BE ANY SODA IN ZEOLITE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A CONSIDERABLE QUAN TITY OF LIME WHICH IS NOT A CONSTITUENT PART OF NATROLITE MR SMITHSON ON THE CONTRARY IS INCLINED TO CONSIDER THEM AS THE SAME SUBSTANCE BY THE AGREEMENT OF THEIR CHEMICAL PROPERTIES AS WELL AS CRYSTALLOGRAPHICAL FORM ALTHOUGH HE HAD MANY YEARS SINCE FOUND THAT THE ZEOLITE OF STAFFA CONTAINED SODA AS HAS SINCE BEEN OB SERVED BY DR HUTTON AND DR KENNEDY HE STILL FELT UNCERTAIN WHETHER THESE WERE OF THE SAME KIND AS THOSE ANALYSED BY M VAUQUELIN BUT HAVING LATELY RECEIVED FROM M HAIIY A CLUSTER OF MESOTYPE IN RECTANGULAR PRISMS TERMINATED BY A QUADRANGULAR PYRAMID MR SMITH SON TOOK THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER THIS SUBSTANCE AND NATROLITE DID OR DID NOT DIFFER IN THEIR COMPOSITION THE METHOD PUR SUED BY THE AUTHOR IN THE ANALYSIS OF ZEOLITE WAS FIRST TO EXPOSE TEN GRAINS OF IT TO A STRONG HEAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING THE LOSS AND HE FOUND IT TO BE 95 GRAIN AN EQUAL QUANTITY WAS THEN DISSOLVED IN MURIATIC ACID AND AFTER THE SOLUTION HAD BEEN EVAPORATED TO DRY NESS THE RESIDUUM WAS EXPOSED TO A RED HEAT WATER WAS THEN POURED UPON IT AND DISSOLVED A PORTION WHICH UPON EVAPORATION WAS FOUND TO BE MURIATE OF SODA WEIGHING 315 GRAINS FROM THE SOLUTION OF THIS SALT NEITHER CARBONATE OF AMMONIA NOR OXALIC ACID OCCASIONED ANY PRECIPITATE BY WHICH IT APPEARED THAT THIS ZEOLITE CONTAINED NO LIME THE RESIDUUM FROM WHICH THE MURIATE OF SODA HAD BEEN EXTRACTED WAS NEXT DIGESTED IN MURIATIC ACID WHICH DISSOLVED A PART BUT LEFT UNDISSOLVED A QUANTITY OF SILICA WHICH AFTER BEING MADE RED HOT WEIGHED 4 9 GRAINS THE MURIATIC SOLUTION WAS THEN EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS AND EXPOSED TO A RED HEAT AND THE RESIDUUM APPEARED TO BE PURE ALUMINA SINCE IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOME MAGNESIA MIGHT ALSO BE MIXED WITH IT IT WAS DISSOLVED IN SULPHURIC ACID AND IGNITED BUT THE RESIDUUM WAS NOT FOUND TO YIELD ANY SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA BY ADDITION OF WATER TO IT THE WHOLE OF THE SULPHURIC ACID HOW EVER HAD NOT BEEN EXPELLED BY HEAT BUT WAS AFTERWARDS SEPARATED BY NITRATE OF BARYTES AND THE ALUMINA WAS ESTIMATED TO AMOUNT TO 2X7 GRAINS THE RESULTS THUS OBTAINED ACCORDED SO NEARLY WITH THE ANALYSIS OF NATROLITE AS GIVEN BY KLAPROTH THAT IT WAS JUDGED UNNECESSARY TO REPEAT HIS EXPERIMENTS ON THAT SUBSTANCE MR SMITHSON IS INDUCED TO PREFER THE NAME OF NATROLITE TO THAT OF MESOTYPE FROM A DESIRE TO PRESERVE UNALTERED THE NAME GIVEN BY BARON CRONSTADT THE ORIGINAL DISCOVERER OF THIS CLASS OF BODIES AND397 THIS INDEED APPEARS BUT A FEEBLE TRIBUTE OF RESPECT TO THE SERVICES WHICH HE HAS RENDERED TO THE SCIENCE OF MINERALOGY SINCE THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF CERTAIN MINERAL SUBSTANCES IN WHICH NOTHING BUT EARTHS HAS BEEN DISCOVERED HAS APPEARED PROBLEMATICAL TO MANY PERSONS AND HAS LED TO THE SUPPOSITION OF THE EXISTENCE OF UNKNOWN ACIDS IN THEIR COMPOSITION MR SMITHSON ENDEAVOURS TO EXPLAIN THIS DIFFICULTY BY SUGGESTING THAT QUARTZ ITSELF MAY BE CON SIDERED AS AN ACID TO WHICH CLASS OF BODIES IT HAS ANALOGOUS QUALI TIES WE SHALL THEN HAVE A NUMEROUS CLASS OF SILICATES BOTH SIMPLE AND COMPOUND AND ZEOLITE WILL BELONG TO THE LATTER AND MAY BE REGARDED AS A HYDRATED SILICATE OF ALUMINA EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE DIFFERENT MODES IN WHICH DEATH IS PRODUCED BY CERTAIN VEGETABLE POISONS BY B C BRODIE ESQ FRS COMMUNICATED BY THE SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING THE KNOWLEDGE OF ANIMAL CHEMISTRY READ FEBRUARY 21 1811 PHIL TRANS 1811P 1781 THE SUBSTANCES SELECTED FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE VEGETABLE POISONS ONLY AND THEY WERE CHOSEN OF THE MOST ACTIVE KIND THAT THE EXACT NATURE OF THEIR EFFECTS MIGHT BE MORE READILY DISCERNED THE PRIN CIPAL OBJECT OF THE EXPERIMENTS IS TO DETERMINE ON WHICH OF THE VITAL ORGANS THE INFLUENCE OF EACH POISON IS EXERTED AND THROUGH WHAT MEDIUM THE ORGAN BECOMES AFFECTED THE FIRST SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS RELATES TO THE EFFECTS OF INTERNAL APPLICATION TO THE TONGUE AND ALI MENTARY CANAL AND THE SECOND TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF APPLICATION TO EXTERNAL WOUNDS WHEN PROOF SPIRIT WAS GIVEN TO A RABBIT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY TO KILL IT THE HEART WAS OBSERVED TO CONTINUE IN ACTION AFTER APPARENT DEATH THE SAME OBSERVATION WAS MADE RESPECTING THE HEART OF A CAT KILLED BY INJECTING THE ROOT OF ACONITE INTO THE RECTUM WHEN THE OIL DISTILLED FROM BITTER ALMONDS WAS EMPLOYED ALTHOUGH NO MORE THAN A SINGLE DROP HAD BEEN GIVEN TO A CAT SHE DIED IN FIVE MINUTES TWO DROPS OF THE SAME OIL INJECTED INTO THE RECTUM OF AN OTHER CAT KILLED IT ALSO IN FIVE MINUTES AND THE HEART IN EACH IN STANCE CONTINUED ACTING AFTER APPARENT DEATH DISTILLED OIL OF TOBACCO EXERTED NEARLY THE SAME ENERGY AS THE DISTILLED OIL OF BITTER ALMONDS AND APPARENTLY IN THE SAME WAY AS THE HEART WAS OBSERVED TO CONTRACT AFTER APPARENT DEATH FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MR BRODIE INFERRED THAT THESE POISONS EXERT THEIR PRIMARY INFLUENCE ON THE BRAIN AND THAT DEATH ENSUES IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE SUSPENSION OF RESPIRATION WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON THE BRAIN WHEN AN INFUSION OF TOBACCO WAS MADE USE OF INSTEAD OF THE EM PYREUMATIC OIL AND INJECTED INTO THE RECTUM THE EFFECTS WERE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE PRECEDING AS THE HEART CONTINUED TO CONTRACT AND WAS UNIFORMLY FOUND IN A STATE OF EXTREME DISTENSION MR BRODIE IS HOWEVER OF OPINION THAT THE HEART WAS NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED BUT THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM FOR WHEN THE SAME

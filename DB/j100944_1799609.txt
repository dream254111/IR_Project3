make my excuses to the Council of the 23ociety for any delay in hearing from me ere this Had I even had the opportunity of transmittinffl papers or news from Tllrkistan it would have been most impolitic to have made the attempt for in the eyes of the natives correspondence is conspiracy  I have been much disappointed in not leing able to effect my oriCinal intentioll of returnina to India from Yarkand via the Pamir and Chitral I found every effort to get away in tllat direction quite useless and no alter ative remained but to retrace my steps to LadalS and essay some other route  I am now alsout startina to explore the Pamir Steppe and the sources of the Oxus by the way of Gilgit and the head of the Chitral Valley and if successful I venture to hope that on return to Encrland I may be enabled to add to the vwolL already done and complete a vely fair map of this part of Central Asia Althourh I can hardly expect the Collncil of the Society to fillly appre ciate the danCers and difficulties which a ilCuropean must have to contend with when entering such countries with the exception of tllose who may know perhaps fIonl personal experieXnce what the Central Asiatics are yet I feel sure they will do me the justice to believe that I have undertaken this exploration with a thoroufrrh likincr for the work in hand7 arid a deter zllination to do my best aIld thouCh it mtlst

the So2srces of the Yarkand River By G lV HAYWARD EgTRACTS I sRRrvED at Leh the capital of Ladak on the 21st of September 1868 having left Murree in the Punjab on the 26th of August From Leh to Yarkand tllere are three routes open to the tra veller to choose The first is the Zamistanee or winter route which froIn Leh crosses the Digur La Pass and ascends the valley of the Shayok Rilrer to near the Karakolam Range lhe second the Tabistanee or sunamer route fiom Leh crosses the Rardong iPass 17574 feet above the sea and the Shayok River at Suttee from whence ascending the Nubra Valley it crosses Karowal Pass and then the diflicult Pass of Sasser 17972 feet above the sea joining the fornler route at Moorghoo The third route froln Leh is vtd Chang Chenmo and the Chang Lang Pass 18839 feet above the sea and crosses the series of high plains lJinU betmreen Chan henrno and the iELuen Iiuen42 JOURNEY FRO LEH TO YAREAND AND ISASHGAPL DECE 13S 1869 Range belomT which it enters the valley of the Karakash River and conducting down that valley joins the TabistAnee route at Shadula The distance from Leh to Yarkand by the Zanlistanee route is a30 miles by the Tabistanee some 480 miles while by the Chang Chenmo route it is 507 miles Shadula loeing distant from Leh by this latter route 316 miles from whence it is 191 miles to Yarkand The great desideratntn to insure an increasing traffic with Central Asia is the opening out of a shorter and easier traderoute leading direct from the Northwest Provinces of India to Yarkand A ood roads avoiding both Rashmir and Ladak nvould offer greater facilities to the Yarkand traders for reaching India direct and have the desired eff8ect of insuring an easier transit as well as doing away with the difficulties both political and geographical which attach to the old Karakoram route The desirability of such an event was so evident that the ascertaining if such a route existed was one of the main objects kept in view by the present expe dition Intending to proceed by the Chang Chenmo route we got of from Leh on the evening of the 29th September and made a short march to Tihsee a z illage situated in the valley of the Indus At 20 miles from Leh the road leaves the Indus Valley and turns to the north up a ravine to the village of Sakti where yaks can be obtained for crossing the Pass into Tanksee The descent on the north side is at first steep and the road con ducts down a ravine to Seeprah a Bhoot encampment in the valley Tanksee 12 miles distant is reached early the next day This village which is 49 miles from Leh is the last plaee in the Maha raja of Kashmirs territory wghere any supplies can be obtained NVith the exception of a few stone huts near Chang Chenmo no habitation is met with nor can any supplies be obtained until leaching Turkistan 400 miles away A delay of two days here nvas therefore unavoidable in order to make the filqal arrangements for the long journey before us Four Bhoots or Ladalz villagers were engaged to accompany me to tbe borders of Turkistan and their yaks laden with grain for the horses Chang Ghenmo is a district lying about 50 miles northeast from Tanksee from which it is reached in three or four clays journey Chang Thangs with Rudok lie more to the eastward The greater part of the Chang Thang district contains saltmines from which the whole of Ladak and part of Tibet are supplied with salt while a large traffic is also carried on with Kashmir The salt is brought down from the mountains on sheep which are extensively usedDEC 13 18693 AND EXPLORATIONr OF THE YAREAND SOURCES 43 throughout Ladak and Tibet for carrying light loads I met a flock of several hundreds coming down the Chang La Pass and laden with salt placed in srnall bags across the back the average weight which one sheep will carry being about 30 lbs The wool of these sheep is considered to be excellent and is in great demand at Leh for transportation to Kashlnir besides which the valuable wool of the shawlgoat aboundint in Chang Thang is the main article of traffic sent to Washmir Leaving Tanksee on the Sth October wf3 proceeded towards Chang Chenmo marching that day to Lukong a place consisting of a few stone huts situated at the end of the Pangong Lake Already thus early we had warnings of the inclemency to be expected from the lateness of the season for a snowstorm came on towards evening during which we wandered from the track and not at once regaining it did not reach Lukong until late at night Between here and Chang Chenmo another high pass the Masimick has to be crossed It is nearl 18500 feet above the sea and is generally covered with snow Crossing the pass we encalnped that niht at Rimdee 2 laics below at an elevation of 17200 feet The cold was sevele the thermometer at 7 AM the next day luarking 3E Fahr iEIavint marched from Pumsul vjre ascended the Kugrang Ailley with the intention of crossing the range at its head and following the stream rising there which is represented on our maps as the Yarkand River doxvn to Aktagh The pass at the head of the valley was fotlnd tc be a very practicable one but no feasible route into the valley of the supposed Yarkand River was discernible XVe therefore returned down the Kugrang Valley losing a horse from cold and inflalumation on the way and camped at Gogra for a few days previous to going on up the Chang Lang Valley on our way to Turkistan More supplies were got up from Tanksee and farewell letters written to England as all commullication between civilisation and the wilds of Central Asia was about to be severed We left Gogra on the 2Sth of October makint a march to some hot springs in the Chang Lang Valley These springs are at az elevation of more than 16000 feet above sealevel and gush out from orifices in the summits of these rocis situated in the bed of the stream which flows tllrough the valley The whole ground is whiteg with incrusted saltpetre while a fantastic pile of earth indi cates the positioll of an old spring now extinct Frorn hot sprinos to the Chang Lang Pass the road is up the bed of the stream which frozen over had to be clossed several times The ascent to the pass lies up a ravine filled with loose stones and4 JOURNEY FRONI LEH TO YRKND AND IVSHGAR Dec 131869 debri8 and is very gradual alld easy to within 500 feet of the summit lhis pass which is at an elevation of 18839 feet above the sea is generally known as the Chang Chenlno one and is said to be the easiest of all the passes leading across the Karakoram and Hindu Eush ranges It is quite practicable for laden horses and camels and would ofler no great impediment to the passage of artillery indeed the ground is so favourable that a little labour expended on the construction of a road up the Chang Chenmo Valley to the pass would render it practicable for twowheeled carts and conveyances Geographically the pass is remarkable as being across the main range of the liarakoram forming the watershed between the Indus and the Tulkistan rivers and constituting the natural boundary of the Maharaja of Kashmirs dominions to the nortll The road from the pass is level and good down the open valley between the low hills to Nischu where we calnped without finding grass or fuel or even water so late in the Jear The cold was intense the thermoIneter at 7 AM marking 11 below zero I found it most difficult to Leep anything liquid without being lost Every thing froze at once ana burst the bottles Tryino to paint in water colours was out of the question WVater brushes and colours all froze together and the enamel on the tin paintboxes cracked om the intense cold The country beyond the pass until the Luigzi lhung Plains are reached consists of low hills and broken ridges of sand and clay formation It is evidently covered witll snow during the winter since the surface of the ground shows signs of the action of runnint water from the nlelting of the snows Some 16 nsiles fiom the pass is the descent to the Lingsi Thung Plains which are nearly 17000 feet above sealevel and extend for 40 to 50 miles from northwest to sotltheast Their breadth is some 25 miles being bounded on the south by the Warakoram chain and on the north by a somewhat irregular and lower range called the Lak Tsung Mountains They are covered with snow during the svinter and in the summer many lakes and pools of water must be brmed by its melting At this time of year llonvever not a drop of water xvas to be found all the pools havin dried up or infiltrated uto the sand The wind blowing across these elevated plains was intensely eold and directly after leaving the low hills the full force of it was felt My selvants complained most hitterly and seemed to be quite incapable of doing anything The weather was generally fine with a clear sky during the months of October and Nonrember but the wind which calue on to blomr daily from noon until sunsetDEC 13 18693 AND EXPLOPtAT10N OF THE YARIvAND CVURCES 49 was most intensely cold The only way to cross these inhospitable regions in any comfort is to bring wood and water from the Chang Lang Valley and this xve failed to do as the Bhoots with the usual obtuseness of Ladak villagers never mentioned the total absence of these requisites until after we had crossed the pass Beyond the Lak Tsung Mountains is a second series of plainse with low ranges running through them extending up to the spurs of the Kuen Luen range Thef are similar to the Lingzi Thung but some 1000 feet Gower Late in the evening of the day we entered thele we arrived at Thaldat orhere is a frozen lake and spring The nvater here was very brackish but the animals drank it eagerly being the first they had had for four days There was no grass howener at Thaldat but the day we left the place some was discovered in a ravine lyint west of it about a lnile away As I had failed to find a pass from the head of the Rutrang Valley into the valley stlpposed to contain the head source of the Yarkand River I determined to attempt a route across the moun tains from Thaldat though from the probable absence of grass and water it xvas a somewhat hazardous undertakinp for our animals so late in the year At some a0 to 60 miles distanec direct norths  knew we should strike the valley of the Karakash River below the Kuen Luen range and the route which I intended to explore might lead us anywhere When I gave orders to strike the camp and prepare to march the Bhoots and my own servants were anything but pleased at going oS to explore a new route I had this morn ing ascended the ridge lying west of Thaldat and obtained a good view of the country around Looking north was seen the lower range of the Kuen Luen with its highest peaks glistening in the morning sunlight while eastward stretched the wide expanse of desert known as the Aksai Chin In many places the appearance of a mirage indicated the position of a former lake the water of which had IlOW evaporated leavint an extensive saline incrusta tion while a large lake was distinctly visible to the southeast 13eJrond this again some high snowy peaks occurred but whether situated in the main chain of the Kuen Luen or in a secondary spur of that range could not be determined with acctlracy The iinpres sion at the time favoured the supposition that the main chain of the Ruen Luen terminates as such somewhat abruptly to the east ward and at about the 82 meridian radiates in loxver spurs running down into the hith tableland of the Akeai Chin or NVhite Desert A high range in which are peaks of upwards of 20000 feet above sealevel bounded the view at the distance of 80 miles to the south46 JOURNEY FRO1AI LEH TO TARISAND AND ISASHGAR DEC 13 18G9 east This range either the continuation of the main Karakoraln chain or a spur froln it was visible stretching from the head of Ghang Chenino and trending with a direction of ENE towards the spurs of the Kuen Luen to the eastward Looking to the west it was evident that a journey of 25 to 30 miles in that direction would strike the headwaters of the supposed Yarkand River if an easy pass could be found across the range forming its east watershed A valley running westward appeared to offer the best route and getting into this we went up to its head and crossinc a low ridge descended into a wide sandy valleAr flanked by irregular detached ridges WAre encamped here for two days in order to give the animals a rest as fortunately there was a little grass and fuel obtainable and I went off alone to explore the country ahead The features of the mountains about here are irre gular and brolren ranges of red clay and sand formation while the valleys and ravines are filled with sand and conglomerate No water was to be seen in any of the valleys or ravines excepting in one or two places where a deeper depression in the valley had accumulated a little water which was now one mass of ice It was gratifying to find a very easy pass across the range beyond which should be the valley of the Yarkand River and all the animals xvere safely got over across the watershed into a branch valley late on the evening of the 4th of Novenlber The pass was found to be 17859 feet above the sea by the tem perature of boiling water and is a mere ascent of a few hundred feet from the valley below with an equally easy descent on the north side It is hardly worthy the name of a pass in the general accep tation of the term still no less is it across a watershed into the head of one of the Turkistan rivers I then discovered that the direct road to cozne from Chang Chenmo to this pass would have been direct from the Chang Larg Pass skirting the Lingzi Thung Plains and that a valletr across from there direct was shorter and easier than the one which we had followed from Thaldat At 10 miles below the Kizil Pass we struck the junction of a large valley coming in froln the southwest in latitude 35 16 25 N and camped here callint the place Kiziljilga This was evidently the upper waters of the Karakash River now nearly frozen over At the time I imagined this stream to be the main branch of the Yark and River which it should have been were our present maps correct but eventually by following this river down to Shadula it proved to be the real Karakash which instead of rising in the Kuen Luen Mountains has its source where the Yarkand River is represented as risillg in the valley lying west of the range borderDc 1o 1869 AND ENlLORATION OF THE YARIVAND SOURCES 47 ing the Lingzi Thung Plains in that direction which range forms its east watershed The nest day we nade a long march down the main valley which runs northwest and is wide and open and the road excel lent Again the wind came on to blow and surveying was certainly accomplished under difficulties When on some high ridge of mcuntain after taking the bearings of the diSerent peaks around it was often difficult enough to write down the obsersations legibly in ones fieldbook Notwithstanding the estreme inclemency of the weather I enjoyed the exploration thoroughly for all this ccountry was totally unexplored and it was interesting in the ex treme since at the tirne I did not know what river it was that we were following and furtherrnore the road was so good and quite practicable for laden horses and calnels that it was probable I was then traversing what in future would becotne the main traderoute between India and Eastern Turkistan Six miles beyond the hot springs the rierer suddenly turns to the northeast and from this bend resembled a frozen lake for 3 miles Kof about llalfamile in width The Journey was here over the ice since the steeper sides of the mountains and the rocky ground rendered a road along the bank snore difficult than one over the zrozen rlver The river diverging at this point to the north east was at first unaccountable since if it were the Yarkand Rier its course from here should have been northwest et it was soon evident that this cotlld not be the Yarkand River but the real Karakash It was now optional to follow the riter along its downward course or attempt a route across tlle Waratagh range into the basin of the Yarkand River to the westward and join the regular road from across the Karakoram Pass at Aktagh The latter course would be desirable as proving the feasibility cof a traderoute in that direction or otherwise while the forlner offered the greater inducement of exploring the course of the Kara kash down to Shadula It seemed certain that a road conducting up the ravine joining the main valley at this bend or one ascending the wide valley noticed just above the hot springs would lead across the range bounding the Karakash here on the north and named the Karatagh and join the Karakoram route near Aktagh which place lay at a distance of 36 to 40 miles in a direct line from this point Judging from the configuration of the country the pass across the Karatagh would probably be found to be a very easy one and assuredly not more dificult than the famed Kara koram Pass which notwithstanding its notoriety is a very easy48 JOURNEY FROM LEH TO YARKAND AND IsASHGAR Dec 131869t one although at the high elevation of 18317 feet above the sea The interest attachiDg to the course of the liarakash however pre vailed and I determined to follow the river downnvards to Shadula Solne 12 miles below Mulgoon the river suddenly turns to the northwest and runs through the valley of Sarikee to Shadula The name Sarikee is applied to the valley of the Warakash from here downwards which is evidently the Sareka of Moorcroft and the Chinese itineraries We were now under the IVuen Luen range solne high peaks in which rose immediately to the northeast and coming in at thisk bend is a valley from the southeast down which the road frorn Thaldat conducts which route we should have folloved had we nof diverged from there I had now proved the river we had beett following to be the real IVarakash and thus to have its rise not in the Kuen Luen range but in the main chain of the Karakoram The walley effecting a junction here from the southeast has hitherto been represented as containing the main branch of the river and the error has apparently arisen froin Mr Johnson not having seen the point of junction of the real stream when he crossed this valley on his way to Khotan in 1865 Mr Johnson it is known went into the valley of the upper Karakash but never so far down the river as to be able to see its upper ccurse for any distance Had he done so any observations for altitudes would have shown that this could not be the same stream as that which passes Aktagh on account of the diSerence in the elevations of the sexeral places Any one not following the river downwards would probably make a siluilar mistake for the configuration of the country as seen from a distance would lead one to suppose that the river continueclJ the genelal direction of its upper course in tlle same line as far as Aktagh From this point the Karakash runs with a general course bearing WNW to Shadula some 75 miles distant and skirting the southern base of the Kuen Luen which rises in a lligh rugged range to the north some of the hibher peaks attaining to an altitude of 21000 and 22000 feet above the sea We reached Shadula on the 20th November and found the fort occupied by a Panjabashi subofficer and some dozen soldiers of the Yarkand ruler As I llad come openly as an Englishman the news that I was on my way to Yarkand had reached there many days before and tne time that had elapsed in following the Earakash River down to Shadula had given the guard ample opportunity of making arrangernents to allow me to proceed or stop me here according to their orders49 tc 13 TSC9 AND ENPLORAT10N OF THE WrARIrAND SOURCES Arrived at Shadula I found that Mr Shar who had travelled rlp fronl Rangra with a large cararran of tea and other goods had reached here by the direct Chang Chenmo route a few days earlIer rThe guard would not allow us to communicate in any way and it vas at once evident that they were immensely suspicious at the aImost simultaneous arrixal of two Englishlnen UnforturlatelAr Ir Shaw and myself had been irk ignorance of each others inten tions and lnovements and were therefore unable to combine our plans and act in concert After some conrersation with the Panja bashi by means of an interpreter I began to perceive how matters stoodl which lnay be thus explained A Moghul at Yarkand who had lately arrived from Ladak had spread thele a report that fifty Englishmen were comLIlg and that he had seen them himself Ccnsequently the greatest amount of suspicion presJailed in Yar leand whence messengers were daily despatched to the King at his calup beyond Rashgar where it was reported he was holding the iEtussians in cheek on the northern frontier of Turkistan Some Punjabi terchants arriving a few days later had gleatly relieved the fears of the suspicious Yarkandies by assuring tham that the report about fifty Englishmen coming was entirely Slse and the Moghul who had caused the alarm was at once imprisoned and would probablJr be execllted Still their distrllst so easily aroused was not to be at once allayed and an extra gllard was immediately despatched to Shadula with strict orders to stop any one there coming from Ladak OI1 my expressing a wish to the Panjabashi to have a letter sent off to the King asking permission to proceed he ordered a mounted sipahi to be in readiness bllt as none of the men could write and of course Enlish was unknown in Turkistan a difficulty pre sented itself This was at length got over and alranged by my vrriting a letter in English to the Wing and giving to my inter preter to take accolepanied by the sipahi A horse was also pro 7ided for lny man who had strict instructions as to what he had to say that I had tlavelled a distance of 8000 lailes occupying siS months and now having arrived on the borders of Turkistan sent forward asking permission to enter his countrfr and have the honour of an interview An answer to nly application could not be expected to arrive vrithin twenty days and during the nest few days I considered what other plans lay open to me to endeavour to carry out should permission to enter Turkistan be refused To return to Ladak across the mountains in December would be sufficiently unpleasant but as the Zojji Ltl Pass into IVashmir would be closed by the snow YOL XIV E50 JOURNEY FROBI LlnH T WrRNAND AND ItASHGAR Dec 13 18G9 there would remain the only alternative of wintering in Ladak and in the spring endeavouring to penetrate to Turkistan and the Pamir Steppe by some other route The idea of passing a winter in Ladak doing nothing was not to be entertained and to be turned back now after having tranrelled 800 sniles from our OWll frontier would be most unpleasant Having discovered the source of the Karakash to be where all our maps make the headwaters of the larger river the Yarkand oneto have theis rise it was lnost desirable to ascertain the real course of the Yarkand River as being the chief river of Eastern Turkistan I was therefore nwost anxious to undertake this expe dition knowing the time could not be better employed while awaiting the return of my messenger fIom Yarkand The difEculty in accomplishing it lay in the close surveiltance of the guard of Turki sipahis which rendered any attempt at getting away on an exploring expedition unlikely to be successful and if the sipahisF suspected my object theJ would be sure to accompany me in which event using surveying instruments openly would be oltt of the question and any exploration further than twv or three dayst journey also impossible There was a chance that I might be able to get away for the day for the purpose of shooting without being accompanied and this seemed to be the only way of shaking ofF the guard The Inen with me at this time besides my own serarants vnrere the Bhoots who had accompanied me from Ladak They were awaiting my interpreters return from Yarkand when if I was allowed to proceed they would be dismissed to their homes or else accompan me back to Ladak should I have to return They regarded the Turki sipahis in no nery friendly light and were therefore not likely to disclose my plans which were carried out successfully Leaving my own serlrants in charge of camp and taking thtee of the Bhoots with a weeks supply of provisions we started from Shadula at the first streak of daylight on the morning of the 26th November without the guard beillg arare of our departure Marching up the valley leading to the Kirghiz Pass beyond which lies the valley of the Yarkand River we encamped that night at Kulshishkun a fainous place for wild yak but this day found without any large game upon it iE rom Shadula the road runs up the right side of the stream and is gradually on the ascent to Kulshishkun which is 13965 feet above sealevel or some 1800 feet higher than Shadula from which it is 15 miles distant To the north of the valley the western Kuen Luen range rises into lofty peaks while to the south it is bounded by

some 2000 yards in width was here found by observation of the teluperature of boiling watel to be 12130 feet above sealevel This was the furthest point down the Yarkand River which was reached There nvas every probability that the guard of Turki sipahis would follow us from Shadula and arriing at the junction of the Kirthiz Pass Gralley before we could return thus cut me off from going up the river to its source consequently I determined to luarch back up the valley during the night Retracing our steps we reached the spot where we had lighted a fire the evening before and as soon as day broke started back again up the valley Crossing to the nortll side I left the men xvith me at the foot of the mountain and conlmenced the aseent of a steep spur of the EZuen Luen It was evident that a station on this range would command an extensilre viear and what appeared to be the most accessible point was fixed upon for the attempt Theg steep slope of the mountain covered with loose shingle and sand was most unfavourable for climbing and very different from the Kashlnir lnountains which although steep afford firm footing on the grass and rocks AYhen the crest of the ridge however was gained the difficulty decreased and though the higher slope was steeper the ascent was more rapidly and easily accom plished After five hours hard climbing I reached the summit of the nsountain in time to fix the latitude of the range by the suns meridian altitude The magnificent view which this station coznmanded was an alnple reward for the toil of the ascent Far away to the south and south west stretched the high peaks and glaciers of the Karakoram and Muztagh Range some of whose loftiest sunlluits attain to the height of from 2S000 to 28000 feet above the sea One peak situated to the east of the Mllztagh Pass reaches the stupendous elevation of 28278 feet above sealevel and is one of the highest mountains in the world Beyond where the river sweeps out west the snowy peaks above the

traverse the rnountains between the crest of the chain and the longitudinal valley of the Yarkand River appear to narrow into ravines towards the head of the rane and are filled with glaciers and the whole surface of the ground to the north of the chain is probably more elevated in its average altitude than the mountain system embracing the southern slopes of the range in the watershed of the

from which the peaks and glaciers could be so well seen stretching far away on every side in their solemn grandeur Descendlng into the ravine beneath I went on down its rocky bed and at four miles

campaigns and extolling the military prowess and bravery of his leader and ruler the Atalik Ghazee Passing along the north wall of the fort the storms of xYar and siege which the illfated Chinese underwent have left their traces in the marks of bullets and cannonballs with which the wall is perforated From here the Kashgar road bears away west passing the village of Karakoom and Bigil to where at 4 miles from the city it crosses the Urpi Canal by a wooden bridge The road is deep in dust and the traveller is covered with it as it is kicked up by the horses VOL XI  P6t JOURiEY FROM LEH rro

yearly take their caravans of gOods across the Pamir Steppe to Badakhshan Tasl Isurgan or 4tone Fort the capital of the Sarikol district lies in a xvsw direction from Yarkand at about 175 miles distance while the total distance to Fyzabad the chief tonn in Badakishan is some 460 miles A journey of frozn seven to eiht days to Task kurgan and of eighteen days to Badakshan is considered very rapid travelling but the caravans of the traders seldom acconlplish the whole distance nnder the period of one month The road traverses a plain country for nearly 70 tniles from Yarkand and then crosses a low range into the Sarikol district alnd ascending the valley of the Charling iliciver crosses the Chichiklik Pass leading across a high spur of the main Pamir range into the Tash kurgan valley From Tashkurgan it crosses the pass at the head of the Sarikol territory and conducts through Pamir Rhurd into the valley of the Osus The road is practicable for laden horses throughout and for camels as far as the foot of the Chichiklik Pass from the Turkistan side and from Badakhshan up to the head of Pamir Khurd from the westward We remained five days in Yanghissar living in a most comfort abie serai which the Atalik has lately had built for his own especial use since he is in the constant habit of visiting Yanghissar from Kashgar This was by far the most picturesque place which was seen in Turkistan the great cause of its attraction being the anagnificent view of the lofty Kizil Yart range of the Pamir which is full in sight lying southwest and west Contrary to the usual supposition7 that the eastern crest of the Pamir slopes down very gradually into the high plateau of Eastern Turkistan or the high plain country of Central Asia the range forming its eastern crest rises into a chain of lofty peaks of 20000 to 21000 feet above sea level the spurs from which run down most abruptly into the high tableland below The range thus presenting a steep face towards the plains of Eastern Turkistan the slope of the vvatershed will be found to be very gentle and sloping to the westward while the waters assuing from the lakesystem of the Pamir must of necessity drain into the basill of the Osus The Kizil Yart range is crossed by high passes leading on to the true Pamir and it is exceedingly unlikely that any of the Pamir lakes drain to the eastward into the ashgar River and its tributaries A high peak in this range known by the name of Taghalma lies at the distance of 63 miles evsw from Yanghissar This Taghalma peak is the most coniEC 13 1869 AND EXPLORATION OF

by observation of the suns lueridian altitude to be in latitude 38 52 3 4 s and by triangu lation and from its distance and bearing from Yarkand the meridian of 76 18 E has been assigned for its longitude The day we reached Kashgar I proceeded to a caravanserai lying between the fort and old city and situated on the right bank of the river and the following morning went to an interview with Xaholned Yakoob Beg the Atalik Ghazee and ruler of Eastern Turkistan Passing through the north gate iato the fort a body of Tungani soldiers armed with long lances were first noticed drawn up on each side of the way while a guard of Turki sipahis in scarlet unifors and high sheepskin caps were grouped around some few pieces of artillery in position near the main entrance It was evident that the Eush Begie had ordered an e2ztra gathering of his followers in some sort of review order with a view to exhiliting a military display Dismounting at the entrance of a large court yard I was conducted by the Yuzbashee across this enclosure to the gate of an inner collrt where a Yusawal bashee dressed insthe costume and chainarmour of the Egyptian Malnelukes came forward to say that if I would sit down for a few aninutes the Atalik would be prepared to see me I accordingly waited until he re turned and ushered me across the second court which with the Xirst was filled with men all dressed in silk and armed Nothing could be more picturesque than the gaudy display showing the outward glitter of Oriental pomp and splendour in the courts where but lately all the horrors of siege and starvation had been endured by the illfated Chinese Their Moslem conquerors had however effaced all traces of the tragedy and if cruel and merci less in their religlous fanaticism to their foes their frank and snanlsr courtesy and warlike bearing contrasting most strikingly with the degenerate and effeminate Chinese win ths goodwill as well as excite the admiration of the stranger Arrayed in every variety of coloured costume with bright arms and studded accoutrements they sat or stood in rows under the verandahs as I passed to my interview with the Eing Having reached the entrance of the innermost court I found it to be quite empty save a piece of ordnance in position with muzzle pointed towards the entrance gate At the farther end of this court sitting under the verandah in front of his apartments was the Atalik Ghazee himself and here as at Yarkand no display or decoration appeared in the plain F 2G8 JOURNLY iS031 LEH T0 RItANTD AND IsASHGAI Dec 1a 1869s and unadorned buildings of his palace As if scorning any costli ness but that of military display everything about him is in keeping with his silnple and soldierlike habits Never so happy as when living the hard life of the soldier in camp or assisting with his own hands to erect forts on his threatened frontier it is not too much to predict that were Asia alone in the hands of its llative rulers he would prove the Zenghis Khan or Tamerlane of his age But with more sagacity and foresight than those conquerors he admits the inevitable contact of the strong European races and bends himself to the overpowering force of circumstances The Yusawal bashee who escorted me retiring I advanced alone bowed and then shaking hands sat down opposite to the Atalik He was dressed very plainly in a furlined silk choga with snow white turban and in the total absence of any ornaments or decora tions presented a striking contrast to the bedecked and bejewelled rajas of Hindustan I was at once favourably impressed by his appearance which did not belie the deeds of a luan who in two years has won a kingdom twice the size of Great Britain He is about fortyfive years of age in stature short and robust with the stronglymarked features peculiar to the IJzbegs of Andijan His broad massive and deeplyseamed forehead together with the keen and acute eye of the Asiatic mark the intelligence and sagacity of tle ruler while the closelyknit brows and firm mouth with its somewhat thick sensuous lips stanlp him as a man of in domitable will xvho has fought with unflinching courage and never sparing his own person has in the hour of success been alike stern and pitiless in his hatred to his foes Although an adept in dissimulation and deceit the prevailing expression of his face was one of concern and anaziety as if oppressed with constant care in maintaining the high position to which he has attained His manner was however most courteous and even jovial at times If report speaks true his bed can hardly be one of roses as it is said that the danger from some secret assassins hand is so great that he never remains for more than one hour in the same apartment during the night The fewpresents which I had broughtt for the Atalik were deli7eredj and a man was summoned to in terpret who remained standing at some short distance on the ground below the verandah The conversation was at first the usual Oriental etiquette and shortly afterwards the Atalik Ghazee expressed a hope that the English would in future visit his country as hitherto they had been prevented from entering Central Asia by the Bokhara tratedy when Colonel Stoddart and Captain Conolly were murdered by the Ameer of Bokhara in 1842 He then proDEa 13 1869 AND EXPLORATION OF THE YAREAND SOURCES 9 ceeded to say that another

provinces of Eastern Turkistan with a wild rabble of unscrupulous followers in 18aT and 1858 executing and murdering the most innocent people for the mere sake of shedding blood The Atalik however never mentioned that he had himsslf involuntarily avenged the murder of Schla gintweit and this he might have averred for he cut Nullee Khans throat two srears ago After a short conversation I took leave and was conducted to the house of the Yusawal bashee in which quarters were assigned to me during my stay in iashgar It is almost needless to say that the same strict sqZrveillaflce was exer cised here as at Yarkand and I was not permitted to go about This was more especally the case when staylng in the larger towns but when on the march and moving fiom place to plate the surveTllance of the escort somewhat relaxed and greater liberty was enjoyed I remained in Kashgar for upwards of a snonth from the Sth March to the 13th Apriland during this tilne took Kobsenations as opportunity offered The resulting position ob tained for the fort was in latitllde 39 19 37 s and by its dis tance and bearint from Yarkand it was found to be in longitude 76 20 E while the elevation of 4165 feet above sealevel was determined from observation of the boilingpoint of water The position of the city of iliashgar lying directly north from the fort across the river was estimated to be in latitude 39 23 9t N and in the same meridian of 76 10 E I left Rashgar on the return journey as the sun rose on the morning of the 13th April It was one of those perfectly clear days so characteristic of the climate of Eastern Turkistan and in the grand display of the mountain masses around oSered an ample compensation for the long detention and delay which had been experienced Lying north immediately beyond the iKashgar River appears a low nadulating ridge of ground from which the transserse slopes rull down very evenly and gently into the level plain beyond the river Beyond this again an irregular rocky range occurs present ing a steep face to the south an opening in which admits the axit of a stream fowing with a southeasterly course to its junction with the Eashgar Eiver A road

view of the bare slopes of the mountains with their snowcrowned summits Although forests are found on the northern slopes in the basin ot the range yet no trees are visible from the south or at any r ate no tilnber of suflicient height to be seen at the distance of Kashgr It is not known with any degree of certainty to what altitude the passes across the range attain but if the mean elevation of 1S800 feet is assigned to them this measurement is in all probability sufliciently accurate for an approximate calculation Looking west and south from this point of observation is seen the whole Kizil Yart Range forming ihe eastern crest of the Pamir surmounted by snomcapped peaks and glaciers It would be mpossible for any scene in nature to surpass the vast grandeur of these mountains as seen

its excellency and perfect practibility for laden horses and calnels Indeed the natural advantages of this line are so great that from Chang Chenmo to Koolunooldee in the valley of the Yarkand River a distance of 240 miles a little labour expended on the construction of a road up the Chang henmo Valley would render it practicable for twowheeled carts and conveyances There are too tlle immense advantages of grass and fuel obtainable all down the upper vallear of the Karakash so that this line not only avoids the difRicult passes of Sasser and Eardong on the Ladak side of the Karakoram as well as the Earakoram Pass but possesses the great desideratum of affording grass and fuel on that portion of the route where it is most essential It is desirable to draw especial attention to this

There are many collateral circumstances which invest Mr Haywards memoir with surpassin interest for now that we halre before us his graphic pictllres of this large portion of Eastern Turkistan we lSnow that these also are the very tracts which recently have been opened out to commercial enter prise by our associates Mr Douglas Forsyth and Mr Shaw who have indeed done good international service in bringing about the lllOSt friendly relations between the powerful rtller of Easterll Turkistan the Ataliah Ghazee and otlr countrymen in British India Nay more I happen to know and I relate the fact with treat satisfaction that our rivals in the e2ztension of geoaraphical knowledEge the Russians who have recently done more than all other people in delineating the true geoaraphical features of Central Asia view this opening out of Eastern Turkistan to our coinmerce with no jealous eye but on the contrary are quite content that we as well as themselves should trade with this new natilre power which has consolidated itself since the Chinese have completely abandoned it Nay more I knosr fiom Mr DouClas Forsyth that the Pussian authorities including even his Imperial Majesty and his minister Prince Gortschakof have assured him in a recent journey to St Petersburg that so long as the Ataligh Ghazee Yakoob KooshbeCi confines his rule to the country lyinC between the Thian Shan and the British territories or Tibet thev will not interfere with this Eastern Turkistan which is now entirely independent of China Thus we may hope that these vast intermediate tracts may prolre to be a prolific source of commerce both to the Rtlssians who have long traded with tllem and to otlrselves and be the means of brinaina about aaain the most friendly relations lvith OU1 old allies But passinC from this important international consideration to which as most of those present know I adverted in several of my anniversary addresses I must say that in a purely geoaraphical sense the researches of Mr Hayward and their results have given me the sincerest gratificaticn inas much as they have to a areat extent sustained the broad views of the late Alexander YOt1 Humboldt In the  Asie Centrale of that illustrious geo grapher his saaacity and learninC brought out in 1843 a general sketchmap of all Central Asia And in it se see that those great salient feattlres by rhich the Kuen Luen Mountains are laid doxTn as a distinct chain separated from the Himalayan and Kalakoram chains oll the south as from the Thian Shan on the north whilst in their testerll prolonCation these chains are traversed by the Bolor of which the high Pamir plateau forms the eastern edge  ln mentioning this happy confirmation of the oriCinal views of my illus trious and lamented friend by the actual researches of Mr Hayxvard I beC to remind the Societv that M Pierre de TchihatcheS is now preparing a nexv edition of the  Central Asia  of the illustrious Prussian geoCrapher in which he will sketch with his wellknown perspicuity all the hiChly important additions which have been made by the Russians in their advance over AVestern Turkistan which whether in their occupation or under their influ ence promises to become a frtlitful source of industry and comnlerce as soon as order is introduced into countries which have for many aaes been a scene of turbulence and warfale Sir E RAWLINSON said Mr Haywards travels aSorded another proof that geoCraphical discovery was not a mere dilettante amusement but rvas inti mately connected with tlle public interest Since the expulsion of the Ehinese from Kashaar and Yarkand commercial intercourse between Turkistan and India had been suspendecl except a small traffic carried on loy Eash mirees This infreqvlency of commtmication and the tendency to exaerate remote danCers had created mysterious rumours in Inclia with reCard to Sussian desins beyond the Himalaya The explorations of Mr Hayxvard74 DISCUSSION ON MR HAYWARDS PAPEI and Mr Shaw llad lestored commercial confidellce and shown that the Russians were still a thousanl miles from Kashmir and had no intention of makint any forward movement All the country from the Punjab frontier to the confines of Eastern Turkistan was dependent upon the Maharajah of lsashmir the allv of the British Government From the outlyin villages beyond Leh to the frontier of Turkistan a distance of about 400 miles there was not a sinale house hut village or other inhabited placethe country was a howlinC desert and it was over this reaion that Mr Hayward had assed The Himalaya branched off into two main ridCes extending north svest and southeast the southern of these ridges was called the Karakoram Range and the northern the Kuen Luen Notwithstanding what had been said about the facility with which a Russian force might cross to India by the Chang Chenmo Pass the fact was that beyond that pass lay the more formidable obstacle of the Kuen Luen chain Until recently it was believed that there avas only one pass over that lofty ranae and that that was impracticable to laden cattle but the great point of Mr Haywards discoveries was that he had fotlnd another pass the Yangi Passwhich was much easier than the Sanju Pass Still owina to the attacks of the Nagayr robbers the easier pass sTas not much used but the establishment of a ort there would open up a really good commercial route Baron Hutnboldt bad always maintained that there were two great chains running throuah this part of Asia and that where they approached each other they were connected by a transverse chain Mr Hayward had fully established the truth of that view and had also shown that the rivers risinC to the west of the tlansverse chain flowed towards the Osus while all those risinr to the east flowed towards the centre of the Chinese empire From 1759 till about sis or seven years aCo the country through which Mr Hayward had passed belonged to China but owinC to the disruption of the Chinese empire the TunCanis rose in rebellion and took possession of Yarliand These llunganis themselves a foreiCn race had since been driven out by the people of Kokan under the Ataligh Ghazee who now held sway The opportunities which the visit of Mr EIayward and Mr Shaw to Yarkand had iven of establishing commercial relations between India and Turkistan had not been overlooked by Lord Mayo who had directed the Governor of the Punjab to enter into arrangements with the Maharajah of Kashmir for surveying the routes and opening them to traffic Mr WYLIE observed that whereas he had formerly felt bound to loolz askance at Mr HaywaIds and Mr Shaws expeditions as involving a certainty lDf great perils out of all proportion to the possible profit he now felt that arrears of credit were due from him towards those enterprising gentlemen lnheir safe return had practically disposed of his mistivings He con ratulated them most cordially on their grand success In reply to a question from hIr GeorCe Campbell Sir H RAWLINSON said that thouCh Mr Hayward had not actually ascended the Yangi Pass he had seen it and conversed with those who had done so with laden mules Dr LEITNER explained the use of several articles of Yarkandi manufacture and the meeting was adjourned to the 10th January 1 870

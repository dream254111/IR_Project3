vertebrate zoology at Cornell University February 7 Alfred C Weed 05 presented the results of his study of the Bra zilian Siluridse or catfishes in the museum They were collected in 1870 by Charles Frederick HIartt the first Cornell professor of geology and paleontology he was a pupil of the elder Agassiz whom he accom panied on the Thayer expedition in 1865 in 1870 he organized the Morgan expedi tion from Cornell University and in 1878 died in Brazil of yellow fever Among the numerous valuable specimens obtained by Hartt and his associates were ninety siluroids Some years ago they were sent for identification to Professor C H Eigenmann of the Indiana University with the privilege of retaining some duplicates and describing the new species There were found two new species described by Kindle in 1894 as Hassar wilderi and Hemiancistrus long4pinnis Of the latter through inadvertence but one ex ample was sent In the Cornell museum in addition to a mounted specimen that had been mounted so as to dispJay the tufts of inter opercular bristles and the tail obliquely trancated the lower lobe produced Mr Weed has found two alcoholic examples one will be sent to Dr Eigenmann and the other to the ruseum of Comparative Zoology at Cam bridge BURT G WILDER THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY NORTHEASTERN SECTION THE fiftyeighth regular meeting of the sec tion was held on Friday evening February 24 in the Lowell building Massachusetts In stitute of Technology with President Norris in the chair About seventyfive members were present 1Mr Charles A Kraus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gave an experimental lecture on The Chemistry of Liquid Am monia Solutions in which he described the solubility of various bodies in liquid ammonia which possesses a high solvent power for many substances especially those containing carbon 513 with many of which it gives brilliant colored solutions Electrolytic dissociation in am monia solutions was discussed and it was shown that ammonia was a much weaker elec trolytic agent than water the ions traveling 28 times faster in it than in the latter solvent The alkali metals sodium and potassium are very soluble in NH and the solutions conduct electricity like a metallic conductor ARTHUR M COMEY Secretary DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE LITERARY PRODUCTION ABOVE FORTY TO THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Your making available by quotation in the last issue of SCIENCE the precise form of Professor Oslers much discussed obsessions concerning the comparative uselessness of men above 40 years of age suggested an inquiry into the period of production in the lives of American men of letters literature being one of the fields of achievement from which Dr Osler believes we could well spare the work done by men above 40 Even in poetry ewhere there might be especial reasons for the view the case is doubt ful Bryant indeed wrote his most noted poems before 40 but wrote others quite as good at 70 Poe and Lanier died at 40 and 39 so their evidence is inconclusive But Longfellow wrote Evangeline at 40 IHia watha at 48 and Miles Standish at 51 Whit tier wrote Snow Bound his best and most characteristic poem at 59 Whitman had done but little before his first considerable volume at 41 Lowell alone of the more noted Amer ican poets produced practically all of his best verse before 40 practically all of his best prose was written afterwards In prose everything goes to disprove an age limit of 40 Except Jeffersons draft of the  Declaration of Independence written at 33 Irvings SketchBook at 36 Thoreaus Walden at 37 Coopers best novels and for the reason given above all of Poes prose almost every notable piece of American prose was written after its author had reached 40 Some came much later Edwardss Freedom of the Will at 51 MARCH 31 1905514 SCIENCE Franklins  Autobiography after 51 and Irvings Alhambra at 49 Hawthorne be gan his series of great romances with The Scarlet Letter at 46 Mrs Stowe wrote Uncle Tom at 41 Mark Twain produced Innocents Abroad before 40 but Tom Sawyer and  Huckleberry Finn consider ably later Lincoln delivered the Gettys burg Address at 54 Webster his Reply to HIayne at 48 Prescott wrote the Conquest of Mexico at 47 Bancrofts History oc cupied him from 34 until 75 Motley wrote the Dutch Republic at 42 Parkman did not begin his series of volumes on France and England in North America until he was 42 The first and the second series of Emer sons Essays appeared at 38 and 41 respect ively Dr Holmes wrote the Autocrat at 49 Ir Hale The Man Without a Country at 46 John Fiske did his best work as Mr Stedman has done his after 40 Mr Howells had scarcely made a beginning of his char acteristic work before 40 Mr James had made a good beginning but the most and the best of his works have come later Indeed if one were to generalize at all from this data concerning works notable in themselves and most characteristic of their authors the conclusion for American litera ture would not be that no work of the first rank had been done by men above 40 but that the period of life conspicuous for superior production was between 40 and 50 and that as BulwerLytton suggested real maturity seldom comes before the age of 35 CLYDE FURST COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PRODUCTION AND TIlE MODERN USE OF CARBONIC ACID To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Referring to SCIENCE for January 27 there appears on page 151 a brief extract of a paper by John C Minor Jr presented to the New York Sec tion of the American Chemical Society on December 9 The title of this paper as given is the Production and Modern Use of Car bonic Acid In the abstract however there is no reference to carbonic acid the paper appears to deal entirely with carbon dioxide N S VOL XXI No 535 and I suppose this is another case of the com mon misuse of this term I would suggest that you make some effort to correct this pre valent error because if we should want to talk about the real carbonic acid there would be no way of conveying the meaning intended unless the chemical symbol be used because as it is CO2 has monopolized for itself two names A BEMENT MONT PELEE ALTHOUGH nothing is commoner than in stances of mistaken etymology it rarely hap pens that a single name admits of so many interpretations as does M ont Pelee sive Mont Pele Having gone through in my own mind all the possibilities of the name from that of the IHawaiian goddess with which I started to that of Pelee bald a good name for a bare summit I have come at last to believe that it is simply the Gallicized form Pelee of the Greek Peleus the son of AEacus and father of AchillesMount Peleus has a likely sound and needs no explanation of its gender The form Pelee for Peleus is found in Littre HARRIS HAWTHORNE WILDER SMITH COLLEGE SPECIAL ARTICLES NATURAL MOUNDS OR  HOGWALLOWS THE paper of Mr A C Veatch reported in SCIENCE No 530 p 310 is of much interest to those acquainted with the natural mounds or hogwallows of California and Oregon Such mounds are especially abundant along the east side of the San Joaquin valley in California where they cover hundreds of square miles and extend from the valley floor where they are most abundant up the slopes of the foothills to an elevation of more than five hundred feet The underlying rocks vary from Pleistocene gravels sands and clays to granites schists and folded paleozoic slates I have never found them however in the sandy river bottoms In height they range from one foot to four feet and in diameter from ten to more than fifty feet They are equally abundant in eastern Oregon and in

Measuremenlit of the Electromotive Force required to pro duce a Spark in Air betweeni parallel metal plates at dif ferent distanices By Professor W THOINISON FRS Received Janiuary 26 1860 The clectrometers used in this investigation were the absolute electroieter anid the portable electrometer described in nmy last communication to the Royal Society and the operations were ex ecuted by the same gentlemeni Mr Smith and Mr Ferguison The conductors between which the sparks passecl were two unvarnislhed plates of a condenser of which one was moved by a mnicrometer screw giving a nmotion of Aj of an itinlc per turn anid having its327 had divided into 40 equal parts of circumfereniee The readinlgs on the screwhead could be readily taken to tenth iparts of a division that is to say to of an iiech oni the distance to be measured The point from whlieh the spark would pass in successive trials being somewhat variable anid ofteui near the edges of the discs a thiln flat piece of metal made very slightlv convex on its upper surface like an extremely flat watch glass was laid on the lower plate It was then found that tile spark always passed betweell the crown of this con vex piece of metal and the flat upper plate The curvature of the former was so small that the phy sic al circumnstances of its ownl elec trification near its crown the opposite electrificationi of the opposed flat surface in the parts near the crown of the convex and the electric pnssure oni or tension in the air between them could not it was supposed differ scensibly from those between two plane conducting surfaces at the same distauce and nmaintained at the sarne difference of potentials The readii6g of tle screwbead corresponding to the position of the moveable disc was always determined electrically by making a sueccssion of sparlks pass and approacLing the moveable disc gria dually by the screw until all appearance of sparks ceased Contact was thus produced witlhout any force of pressuire between the two bodies capable of sensibly distorting their supports With these arranigements several series of experimients were made in which the differenices of potentials producinig sparks across differ ent thicklnesses of air were measured first by the absolute electro meter and afterwards by the portable torsion electrometer The followig Tables exlhibit the results hitherto obtained328 TABLE IDeCenber 13 1859 Measurements by absolute electro meter of maximum electrostatic forces across a stratum of air of differerit thicknesses Area of each plate of absolute

of air is required to prodtuce a spark at short distances than at long When it is considered that the absolute electrification of each of the op posed sturfacest depenids simply on the electromotive force per unit length of the space between them or which is the same thing thel resultant electrostatic force in the air occupying that space it is difficult even to conjecture an explanation Without attempting to explain it we are forced to recognize the fact that a thin stratum of air is stronger than a thick one against the same disruptive tensioni in the air according to Faradays view of its condition as traiis mitting electric force or against the same lifting electric pressure from its boundinig surfaces according to the views of the 180i eent  See  3 below t See  4 belowv329 tury school as represented by Poisson The same conclusion is established by a series of experiments with the previouslvdescribed portable torsioni electrometer substituted for the absolute electro meter

here tabulated stops at the distance 18 thousandths of an inch because it was found that the force in the electrometer corresponding to longer sparks than that was too strong to be measured with certainty by the portable electrometer whether from the elasticity of the platinum wire or from the rigidity of its connexion with the aluminium index being liable to fail when more than 85 or 900 of torsion were applied So far as it goes it agrees remarkably well with the other experiments exhibited in Table I as is showni by the following comparative Table in which along with results of actual

tallic surface balanced by air used in the preceding statement may be perfectly uniderstood I add the followinig explanations and defini tions beloniging to the ordinary elements of the mathematical theory of electricity 1 Measurement of qtantities of electricityThe unit quantity of electricity is such a quantity that if collected in a point it will repel an equal quiantity collected in a point at a unit distanlce with a force equal to unity In British absolute measurements the unit distance is one foot alnd the unit force is that force which acting on a grain of matter during a second of time generates a velocity of onie foot per second The weight of a grain at Glasgow is 322 of these British units of force The weight of a grain in any part of the earths surface niay be estimnated with about as mtuch accuracy as it cau be without a special experiment to determine it for the particular locality by tile following expression  In latitude A average weight of a grain 32 088 x  1  00v 133 x sin2 x Biritish absolute units 2 Electric deisit  This term was introduced by Coulomb to desigonate the quantity of electricity per unit of area in any lart of the surface of a conductor Ile showed how to measure it thouglh not in absollute measure by his proof platne 3 Resdltant electric force at any point in an insulating fluid The resultant force at any point in air or other insulating fluid in the neighbourhood of an electrified body is the force which a unit of electricity concentrated at that point wouild experience if it exercised no influence on the electric distributionis in its neighbourhood 4 Relation bet veen electric cdensity on the suface of a conductor and electric forre at points inz the air close to itAccordilng to a proposition of Couilombs requiriino hbowever correction and first correctly given by Laplace the resultant force at any point in the air close to the surface of a conductor is perpendicular to the surfiace anid equal to 4rp if p denotes the electric denisity of the surface in the nieighbourhood 5 Electric press re fronm the sio face of a concluctor balanced bI 111rA thini mlPetallic shll or liquid filmii as for instfancea soapbubble334 if electrified experiences a real mechanical force in a direction per pendicular to the surface outwards equal in amount per unit of area to 2rp p denoting as before the electric density at the part of the surface considered This force may be called either a repulsion as according to the views of the eighteenth century school or an attrac tioi effected by tension of air between the surface of the conductor and the conducting boundary of the air in which it is ilnsulated as it would probably be considered to be by Faraday but whatever may be the explanation of the modus operandi by which it is produced it is a real mechanical force and may be reckoned as in Col 5 of the preceding Table in grains weight per square inch or per square foot In the case of the soapbubble for instance its effect will be to cause a slight enlargement of the bubble oni electrification witlh either vitreous or resinious electricity and a corresponding collapse on being perfectly discharged In every case we may regard it as constituting a deduction from the amount of airpressure which the body experiences when unelectrified The amount of this deduction being different in differelt parts accordinag to the square of the electric density its resultant action on the whole body distuLrbs its equilibrium and constitutes in fact the resultant electric force experienced by the body 6 Collected formulue of relation between electric density on the suaSface of a conductor electric diminutiot of airpressure po it and resultant force in the air close to the sufiaceLet as before p denote the first of these three elements let p denote the second reckoned in units of force per unit of area anid let R denote the third Then we have R47rp p27rp2 R 7 Electric potentialThe amount of work requiired to move a unit of electricity against electric repulsion from any one position to any other position is equal to the excess of the electric potential of tlhe first positioni above the electric potential oL the second positionl Cor 1 The electric potential at all points close to the suLirface of an electrified metallic body has one value since an electrified point possessing so small a quanitity of electricity as not sensibly to in fluence thle electrificationi of the metallic surfface would if held near tlhe surface in any locality experience a force perpendicular to the surifce in its neihbourhood335 Cor 2 The electric potential throughout the interior of a hollow metallic body electrified in any way by external influence or if in sulated electrified either by influence or by communication of elec tricity to it is constant since there is no electric force in the interior in such circumstances It is easily shown by mathematical investigation that the electric force experienced by an electric point containing an infinitely small quantity of electricity when placed anywhere in the neighbourhood of a hollow electrified metallic shell gradually diminishes to nothing if the electric point be moved gradually from the exterior through a small aperture in the shell into the interior Hence the one value of the potential close to the surface outside mentioned in Cor 1 is equal to the constant value throughout the interior mentioned in Cor 2 8 Interpretation of measurement 6y electroreterEvery kind of electrometer consists of a cage or case colntaining a moveable and a fixed conductor of which one at least is insulated and put in metallic communication by what I shall call the principal electrode passing tlhrough an aperture in the case or cage with the conductor whose electricity is to be tested In every properly constructed electrometer the electric force experienced by the moveable part in a given position cannot be electrically influenced except by changing the difference of potentials between the principal electrode and the uninsulated conductor or conducting system inl the electrometer Even the best of ordinary electrometers hitlherto constructed do not fulfil this con dition as the inner surface of the glass of which the whole or part of the enclosing case is generally made is liable to become electrified and inevitably dloes become so when any very high clectrification is designedly or accidentally introduced even for a very short time the consequence of which is that the moving body will generally not return to its zero position when the principal electrode is perfectly disinsulated Faraday long ago showed how to obviate this radical defect by coating the interior of the glass case with a fine network of tinfoil and it seems strange that even at the present day electro meters for scientific research as for instance for the ilnvestigationi of atmospheric electricity should be constructed with so bad and obvious a defect uncured by so simple and perfect a remedy Wlihen it is desired to leave the interior of the electrometer as much liglht VOL X 336 as possible and to allow it to be clearly seen from any external position with as little enmbarrassment as possible a cage made like a birds cage with an extremely fine wire on a metal frame inside the glass shade used to protect the instrument from currents of air c may be substituted with advantage for the tinfoil network lining of the glass It appears therefore that a properly colnstructed electro meter is an instrument for measuring by means of the motions of a moveable conductor the difference of potentials of two conducting systems insulated from one another of one of which the case or cage of the apparatus forms part It may be remarked in passing that it is sometimes coonvenient in special researches to insulate the case or cage of the apparatuLs and allow it to acquire a potential difering from that of the earth and that then as always the subject of measurement is the di ference of potentials between the prinicipal electrode and the case or cage while in the ordiniary use of the instrument the potential of the latter is the same as that of the earth Hence we miay regard the electrometer merely as an instru ment for measuring differences of potential between two conducting systems miitually insulated aiid the object to be aimed at in per feectinig any kind of electrometer more or less sensitive as it may be accordinig to the subjects of investigation for which it is to be used is that accucate evaluations in a6solute measure of digfferences of potential may be immecdiately derivable from its indications 9 Relation between electrostatic force and variation of electric potential 7 otherwise stated is equivalent to thisThe ave rage component electrostatic force in the straight line of air between two points in the neighbourhood of an electrified body is equal to their difference of pote utials divided by their distance In other words the rate of variation of electric potential per nnit of length in any direction is equal to the component of the electrostatic force in that direction Since the average electrostatic force in the line joining two points at which the values of the potential are equal is nothing the direction of the resuiltant electrostatic force at any point must be perpendicnlar to the equipotential surface passiing through that point or the lines of force which are generally curves cut the series of equipotential surfaces at right auigles The rate of varia tion of potential per unit of length along a line of force is therefore equal to the electrostatic force at any point337 10 Stratum of air between two parallel or nearly parallel plane or cutrved metallic surfaces maintained at diffierentpotentialsLet a denote the distance between the metallic surfaces on each side of the stratum of air at any part and V the difference of potentials It is easily shown that the resultant electrostatic force is sensibly constant through the whole distance from the one surface to the other and being in a direction sensibly perpendicular to each it must  9 V be equal to  Eence  4 the electric density on each of the a opposed surfaces is equal to Y This is Greens theory of the 4vra Leyden phial 11 Absolute ElectrometerAs a particular case of No 10 let the discs be plane and parallel and let the distance between them be small in comparison with their diameters or with the distanice of any part of either from any conductor differing from it in potential The electric density will be uniform over the whole of each of the opposed surfaces and equal to jv being positive on one and nega tive on the other and in all other parts of the surface of each the electrification will be comparatively insensible Hence the force of attraction between them per unit of area  5 and 6 will be 8V as if A denote the area of either of the opposed surfaces the whole force of attraction between them is therefore A V Hence if the observed force be equal to the weight of w grains at Glasgow we have 322 x wA 8wA anid therefore VaV322 x w Addition dated April 12 1860 Experiments on precisely the same plan as those of Table I December 13 have been repeated by the same two experimenters with different distances from 3 to 6 of an inch between the plates of the absolute electrometer and results have been obtained con firming the general character of those shown in the preceding Tables 2 B 2338 The absolute evaluations derived from these later series must be more accurate than those deduced above from the single series of December 13 when the distance between the plates in the absolute electrometer was only 2 of an inch I therefore by permission add the following Table of absolute determinations Electrostatic forces according to I Length of spark i estimated average of determinai in inches tions of February 15 23 28 and S s t 29 and March 2 X 0034

rapid variation with distance of the electro static force preceding a spark at the greater than at the smaller distances It seems most probable that at still greater distances the electrostatic force will be found to be sensibly constant as it was certainly expected to be at all distances The limiting value to which the results shown in the last Table seem to point must be something not much less than 2800 This corresponds to a pressure of 9600 grains weight per square foot We may therefore conclude that the ordinary atmospheric pressure of 14798000 grains per square foot is electrically relieved by the subtraction of 9600 on two very slightly convex metallic surfaces at a distance of Jlth of an inch or more before the air between them is cracked and a spark passes By taking into account the result of my preceding con munication to the Royal Society we may also conclude that a Daniells battery of 5510 elements can produce a spark between two slightly convex metallic surfaces at 1 th of an inch asunder in ordinary atmospheric air

FEBRUARY T T I WHOLE NUMBER 2 FEBR UARY 191 NUMBER I82 ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS AND COLLEGE DOMINATION AS SOURCES OF MOTIVA TION IN HIGHSCHOOL WORK WILLIAM C BAGLEY THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS I MAY CONFESS AT THE OUTSET TO A VERY DECIDED PREJUDICE AGAINST WHAT IS ORDINARILY TERMED COLLEGE DOMINATION THAT PREJUDICE HAS BEEN DERIVED FROM A GOOD MANY YEARS OF EXPERI ENCE IN THE SERVICE OF THE LOWER SCHOOLS I AM NATURALLY JEALOUS OF THE FRUITS OF THAT EXPERIENCE I PAID THE PRICE OF SOME SLEEP LESS NIGHTS AND A GOOD MANY LONGDRAWNOUT BITTER DAYS FOR WHATEVER PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE I MAY POSSESS OF WAYS AND MEANS OF MEETING PUBLICSCHOOL PROBLEMS IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT TODAY ROUSES MY IRE IT IS FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT FACED AND SOLVED SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO MAKE LIGHT EITHER OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT INHERE IN THE ACTUAL CONCRETE PROBLEMS OF THE LOWER SCHOOLS OR THE VALUE OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT COMES FROM FACING AND SOLV ING THESE PROBLEMS I MUST HASTEN TO ADD HOWEVER THAT CONTINUED ASSOCIATION WITH UNIVERSITY MEN LEADS ME MORE AND MORE TO CONCLUDE THAT I WAS ONCE QUITE WRONG IN PLACING ALL OR EVEN A LARGE MAJORITY OF THEM IN THE CLASS OF CRITICS AND FAULTFINDERS I DO NOT SAY THAT THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITIES ARE ENTIRELY DEVOID OF SUCH MEN IN READ AT THE GENERAL CONFERENCE OF THE ACADEMIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS IN RELATIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO NOVEMBER 12 I9GO 73THE SCHOOL REVIEW FACT THE ATTITUDE OF BRAHMANISM IS STILL ALL TOO FREQUENTLY TO BE NOTICED ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNGER MEN AND I THINK THAT IT IS THIS ATTITUDE THAT PUBLICSCHOOL PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO NOTICE WHEN THIS ATTITUDE INFLUENCESAS IT WILL INEVITABLY INFLUENCE THE DISCUSSIONS OF COLLEGEENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS PUBLICSCHOOL MEN ARE LIKELY TO CHARACTERIZE IT AS COLLEGE DOMINATION OF SECONDARYSCHOOL POLICIES THE MORE EXPERIENCED AND INFLUENTIAL COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY MEN HOWEVER RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT MUST ALWAYS ATTACH TO SPECIALIZED ADJUSTMENTS IN ANY FIELD OF HUMAN ACTIVITY I CAN THINK OF NO FAIRER ATTITUDE THAT A UNI VERSITY MAN COULD TAKE TOWARD ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARYSCHOOL PROBLEMS THAN THAT REPRESENTED BY PROFESSOR JOHN M COULTERS ADMIRABLE PAPER READ BEFORE THE RECENT MEETING OF THE NORTH ERN ILLINOIS TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THAT UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE MEN SHOULD LEGISLATE UPON THE MATTER OF COLLEGEENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT COOPERATION OF SECONDARYSCHOOL MEN IS I THINK INDEFENSIBLE THAT SECONDARY SCHOOL MEN SHOULD BE INTRUSTED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COLLEGES IS EQUALLY INDEFENSIBLE WHAT IS NEEDED IS JUST WHAT IS INDICATED IN THE WORD CO OPERATION JUST WHAT IS REPRESENTED BY THIS AND BY OTHER CON FERENCES BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS WE MUST APPROACH THE PROBLEM OF ENTRANCEREQUIREMENTS EACH WITH A FIRM DETERMINATION TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IS VALUABLE IN THE PREJUDICES OF THE OTHER FOR I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PREJUDICES CAN OR SHOULD BE ENTIRELY READ OUT OF OUR DELIBERATIONS PREJUDICES ARE GENERALLY THE RESULTANT ATTITUDES WHICH COME OUT OF THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF IDEALS THE UNIVERSITY MAN IS DOMINATED PRIMARILY BY THE IDEALS OF SCIENCE THE AIM OF HIS LIFE IS TO SEARCH FOR TRUTH AND HE DEIFIES TRUTH FOR ITS OWN SAKE TRUTH IS FOR HIM AN ULTIMATE STANDARD A PURE VALUE NOW THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THIS IDEAL AS I HAVE SUGGESTED GRADUALLY ENGENDERS A PREJU DICEGRADUALLY LEADS HIM TO REACT EMOTIONALLY AND INSTANTANE OUSLY AGAINST ANY PROPOSAL THAT IS IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY INCONSISTENT WITH HIS IDEAL IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS ON THE OTHER HAND THE DOMINANT IDEAL IS COMING VERY RAPIDLY TO BE THE 74ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS AND HIGHSCHOOL WORK IDEAL OF SERVICE THE HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPAL IS MEASURING THE VALUE OF HIS WORK BY THE SERVICE THAT HE RENDERS TO THE COM MUNITY AND THIS IDEAL ALSO ENGENDERS IN TIME A POWERFUL PREJUDICE AN INSTANTANEOUS EMOTIONAL REACTION AGAINST ANYTHING THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE GREATEST SERVICE TO THE GREATEST NUMBER IT IS I THINK IN THE INEVITABLE CONFLICT BETWEEN THESE TWO IDEALS THAT OUR PRESENT IRRITATING PROBLEMS CONCERNING ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS HAVE THEIR ORIGIN NOW WHAT IS NEEDED IS TO MY MIND NOT A SURRENDER OF THESE IDEALS BY EITHER PARTY TO THE CON TROVERSY BOTH TYPES ARE NEEDED AND AS PROFESSOR COULTER SO CLEARLY SHOWED IN THE PAPER TO WHICH I HAVE JUST REFERRED THERE IS NOTHING INCONSISTENT IN THE COOPERATION OF BOTH IDEALS IT IS GOOD FOR THE MAN OF SCIENCE TO HOLD TRUTH AS AN ULTIMATE VALUE FOR IN THE LONG RUN HE WILL RENDER MUCH MORE EFFICIENT SERVICE UNDER THE OPERATION OF THIS IDEAL THAN HE WOULD RENDER SHOULD HE DISCARD IT IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR THE HIGHSCHOOL MAN TO LOOK CAREFULLY INTO THE NEEDS OF HIS COMMUNITY AND TO DETERMINE AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE HOW TO MEET THESE NEEDS IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR RELATION TO THE FULFILLING OF ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS IDEALS I REPEAT MUST VARY WITH THE WORK THAT ONE DOES IN LIFE IF WE ALL HAD PRECISELY THE SAME IDEALS AND PRECISELY THE SAME STANDARDS OF WORTH THIS WOULD BE NOT ONLY A VERY DREARY AND UNINTEREST ING LIFE BUT ALSO A VERY INEFFECTIVE LIFE WHAT IS NEEDED THEN IS NOT A SURRENDER OF IDEALS BY EITHER PARTY TO THE CONTROVERSY IT IS RATHER THE ADJUSTMENT OF IDEALS THE RIGHT KIND OF COLLEGE DOMINATION WILL PROVIDE A USEFUL CHECK UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND THE PROPER DEGREE OF INDEPENDENCE AND INITIATIVE UPON THE PART OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS WILL PROVIDE A USEFUL CHECK UPON THE DEMANDS OF THE COLLEGES WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE BECOME INORDINATE AND UNFAIR THE IDEAL OF THE HIGH SCHOOL IS SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY BUT THIS IDEAL UNCHECKED IS LIKELY TO BECOME SO NARROW AS TO DEFEAT IN SOME MEASURE ITS OWN PURPOSE THE IDEAL OF THE UNIVERSITY IS TRUTH ESTABLISHED BY THE RIGOROUS METHODS OF SCIENCE BUT UN CHECKED THIS IS LIKELY TO PRESCRIBE CONDITIONS WHICH THE ADOLES CENT PUPIL WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO FULFIL THE ESSENTIAL 75THE SCHOOL REVIEW FEATURES OF WHICH COULD BE FULFILLED BY THE SUBJECTMATTER AND METHODS MORE IN HARMONY WITH COMMUNITY NEEDS IT IS WELL FOR EVERY MAN TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC CONCERNING THE WORK THAT HE DOES BUT THIS VERY ENTHUSIASM IMPLIES THE VALUE OF A CHECK AND CONTROL THAT SHALL HOLD THE EXPRESSION OF HIS ENTHUSIASM WITHIN HEALTHFUL LIMITS I AM PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT FOR I AM CONVINCED THAT UNIVERSITY AND HIGHSCHOOL MEN VERY FREQUENTLY MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE OF THIS CONFLICT OF IDEALS I KNOW UNIVERSITY MEN WHO LABOR UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEIR COLLEAGUES IN THE LOWER SCHOOLS ARE DOMINATED BY UNWORTHY MOTIVES WHEN THEY REQUEST THAT CERTAIN SUBJECTS BE GRANTED ENTRANCE CREDITS THEY INSIST THAT THESE HIGHSCHOOL MEN HAVE IN MIND ONLY THE GROWTH OF THEIR SCHOOLS IN NUMBERS AND THE CONSEQUENT GLORY THAT WILL ACCRUE TO THEMSELVES IF THEY BUILD UP A LARGE ENROLMENT THIS INFERENCE IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY IS PURELY GRATUITOUS THE HIGHSCHOOL MAN MAY BE AND IN MOST CASES HE IS I AM CONFIDENT THOROUGHLY SINCERE HE HAS HIS OWN PROBLEM TO MEETA PROBLEM WHICH IS BIGGER AND BROADER THAN MERELY MEETING ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS AND HE MUST STRIVE TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM ON THE OTHER HAND I KNOW HIGHSCHOOL MEN WHO LOOK UPON THEIR UNIVERSITY COLLEAGUES AS PERSONS WHO HOLD IN CONTEMPT THE JUDGMENT OF MEN IN THE LOWER SCHOOLS CON CERNING EDUCATIONAL VALUES AND WHO EITHER CANNOT OR WILL NOT SEE THE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THE COM MUNITY AS PLAYING ANY PART WHATSOEVER IN DETERMINING SUCH VALUES THIS AGAIN IS AN UNJUST ASSUMPTION FOR THE UNIVERSITY MAN IS ALSO SINCERE IN HIS ATTITUDE AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MEN IN THE UNIVERSITIES WHO HAVE AN AIR OF INTOLERANCE TOWARD THE WORKERS IN THE LOWER SCHOOLS WHOM THEY SHOULD IN ALL CON SCIENCE LOOK UPON AS COLLEAGUES AND NOT AS SUBORDINATES THESE MEN ARE NOT AS I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO POINT OUT EITHER NUMEROUS OR INFLUENTIAL I HAVE SPOKEN OF THIS PHASE OF SOCALLED COLLEGE DOMINATION BECAUSE IT IS THE TYPE THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE IN MIND I BELIEVE WHEN THEY USE THE TERM AND WHAT I WISH TO POINT OUT IS SIMPLY THAT IN THIS SENSE OF THE TERM COLLEGE DOMINATION IS IN THE 76ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS AND HIGHSCHOOL WORK MIDDLE WEST LARGELY IMAGINARY THERE IS A SENSE HOWEVER IN WHICH COLLEGE DOMINATION IS FAR FROM IMAGINARY AND SINCE BOTH FORMS HAVE SOME RELATION TO THE MATTER OF MOTIVATION WHICH IT IS MY ESPECIAL PROVINCE TO TOUCH I SHALL REFER BRIEFLY TO THIS LATTER TYPE THE DISASTROUS TYPE OF COLLEGE DOMINATION OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS IS REPRESENTED BY THE LACK OF PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS IN THE TRAINING OF SECONDARYSCHOOL TEACHERS BY PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS I MEAN UNIQUE STANDARDS AND CRITERIA RELATING PRI MARILY TO SECONDARY EDUCATION AS DISTINGUISHED FROM HIGHER EDU CATION IN THIS RESPECT THE PREPARATION OF HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS IS FAR BEHIND THE PREPARATION OF ELEMENTARY TEACHERS FOR THE LATTER IN THEIR NORMALSCHOOL COURSES HAVE THEIR ATTENTION DIRECTED TO THE SPECIFIC AND UNIQUE PROBLEMS OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION AND ARE ADJUSTED TO THE ELEMENTARYSCHOOL SITUATION THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF PRACTICETEACHING WITH ITS CLOSE SUPERVISION AND THE SERIOUS IMPORT WHICH ALWAYS ATTACHES TO IT IN THE NORMALSCHOOL COURSE THE TEACHER GOING INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL HAS IN THE UNI VERSITY BEEN TRAINED IN THE SUBJECTMATTER THAT HE IS EXPECTED TO TEACH BUT HIS PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION IS COMMONLY NIL AND IN ONLY A FEW UNIVERSITIES TODAY IS THIS TRAINING MADE EFFECTIVE THROUGH ACTUAL ADJUSTMENT IN THE PRACTICESCHOOL THE SITUATION IS PRECISELY SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH WOULD CONFRONT ELEMENTARY EDUCATION SHOULD IT RECRUIT ITS TEACHERS EXCLUSIVELY FROM HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AND DEMAND FROM THEM NO SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL TRAINING NOW I BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THE EVILS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED IN THE POPULAR MIND WITH COLLEGE DOMINATION HAVE THEIR ROOT IN THIS CONDITION A FEW DAYS AGO I RECEIVED A LONG AND INTER ESTING LETTER FROM A MAN WHO IS DISSATISFIED WITH THE HIGHSCHOOL CONDITIONS AND WHO IS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT COLLEGE DOMINATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EVILS THAT HE CONDEMNS HE HAD SEEN THIS TOPIC IN OUR PROGRAM AND ACCORDINGLY GAVE ME HIS VIEWS HIS CHIEF POINT OF CRITICISM IS THAT THE WORK OF THE HIGH SCHOOL IS MEASURED BY STANDARDS THAT ARE ADAPTED TO THE MORE MATURE UNIVERSITY STUDENT BUT QUITE UNADAPTED TO THE HIGHSCHOOL ADO LESCENT TO CITE ONE STATEMENT FROM HIS LETTER 77THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE COURSE OF ENGLISH LITERATURE WHICH THE SENIOR PUPILS OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL ARE SUBJECTED TO IS PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL WITH THE COURSE WHICH I HAD IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND WHICH NO COLLEGE STUDENT WAS ALLOWED TO BE ADMITTED TO UNTIL HE WAS A JUNIOR MY CORRESPONDENT MAY BE IN ERROR IN THIS AND IN OTHER CRITI CISMS THAT HE MAKES BUT I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LARGE MEASURE OF JUSTIFICATION IN HIS STRICTURES THEY WOULD NOT OF COURSE HOLD FOR ALL HIGH SCHOOLS BUT THAT THEY HOLD FOR A GREAT MANY IN WHICH THE CLASSROOM TEACHERS ARE FRESH FROM UNIVERSITY COURSES THERE CAN BE LITTLE REASONABLE DOUBT IT IS GENERALLY ADMITTED BY HIGHSCHOOL MEN THAT THE CUSTOMARY COURSES IN SECONDARYSCHOOL SCIENCE FOR EXAMPLE ARE ILLADAPTED TO THE AVERAGE HIGHSCHOOL PUPIL AND LARGELY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BOR ROWED TOO LIBERALLY FROM THE CONTENT AND METHOD OF UNIVERSITY COURSES BOTH SECONDARY SCIENCE AND SECONDARY LITERATURE HAVE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE FUNCTIONS OF THE COGNATE SUBJECTS IN THE UNIVERSITY AND YET THERE IS NOW VERY LITTLE DIFFER ENTIATION AS TO EITHER MATTER OR METHOD NOW I MAINTAIN THAT THIS IS DUE LARGELY TO THE INDIRECT DOMINATION TO WHICH I HAVE REFERREDTO THE LACK AMONG THE HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS THEMSELVES OF DEFINITE AND UNIQUE STANDARDS OF THE TYPE OF CONTENT THE TYPE OF APPROACH AND THE TYPE OF METHOD WHICH BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS AND THIS CONDITION WILL CONTINUE SO LONG AS THE UNIVERSITIES FAIL TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL COURSES SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED IN THE NORMAL SCHOOL FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT IN THE UNIVERSITIES THE NEEDS AND IDEALS OF THE LOWER SCHOOLSTHOSE OF US IN OTHER WORDS WHO ARE CONNECTED WITH THE EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITIES ARE CONSTANTLY FACING THE PROBLEM OF PROVIDING THE CANDIDATES FOR HIGHSCHOOL TEACHING WITH AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENT OF PRO FESSIONAL IDEALS I HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN TOLD BY MY COL LEAGUES AND IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THAT CANDIDATES FOR SECONDARY TEACHERSHIPS COULD MUCH MORE PROFITABLY SPEND ALL THEIR AVAIL ABLE TIME IN MASTERING THE SUBJECTMATTER THAN SPEND A FRACTION OF IT IN PROFESSIONAL STUDY AND YET AN INVESTIGATION THAT I MADE LAST YEAR AMONG THE PRINCIPALS AND SUPERINTENDENTS WHO 78ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS AND HIGHSCHOOL WORK EMPLOY OUR GRADUATES SHOWS THAT IN NO SINGLE INSTANCE DID A GRADUATE FAIL BECAUSE OF LACK OF SUBJECTMATTER AND THAT IN EVERY CASE OF FAILURE WHICH I COULD FIND THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO LACK OF QUALITIES WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY THE PROPER SORT OF PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OR THE INHERENT LACK OF WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN REVEALED BY A COURSE IN PRACTICETEACHING I MAINTAIN THAT WHAT MY CORRESPONDENT ATTRIBUTES TO COLLEGE DOMINATION IS DUE TO COLLEGE DOMINATION IN THE LAST ANALYSIS BUT THAT IT IS NOT DUE TO THE KIND OF DOMINATION WHICH HE HAS IN MIND IT IS THE INDIRECT BUT MUCH MORE INSIDIOUS AND DANGEROUS DOMINATION OF COLEGE METHODS AND COLLEGE STANDARDS CARRIED DOWN INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL BY COLLEGE GRADUATES BECAUSE THESE ARE THE ONLY METHODS AND THE ONLY STANDARDS THAT ARE FRESH ENOUGH IN THEIR MINDS TO BE APPLIED THIS IS A VASTLY DIFFERENT KIND OF DOMINATION FROM THAT WHICH IS MEANT BY MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY USE THE TERM WHO HAVE IN MIND THE UNIVERSITY MAN WITH THE BIG STICK OF ENTRANCEREQUIREMENTS CLUBBING THE HIGH SCHOOLS INTO AN ARBITRARY LINE THE HIGHSCHOOL VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITIES OF THE MIDDLE WEST ARE SO FAR AS I KNOW ESSENTIALLY PUBLIC SCHOOL MEN THOSE WITH WHOM I HAVE TALKED DEPLORE THE CON DITIONS THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED JUST AS THOROUGHLY AS MY CORRE SPONDENT DEPLORES SUCH CONDITIONS THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HIGH SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN DISTINCTIVE IDEALS AND ADHERE TO THEM AND NOW I HAVE ONLY THE BRIEFEST TIME IN WHICH TO DISCUSS THE RELATION BETWEEN COLLEGEENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS AND COLLEGE DENOMINATION ON THE ONE HAND AND THE PROBLEM OF MOTIVATION ON THE OTHER FIRST OF ALL I MUST STATE WHAT I MEAN BY MOTIVATION AND WHAT I THINK TO BE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS CONCEPT IN EDUCATIONAL THEORY IN ESSENCE A MOTIVE IS THE IDEA OF AN END MORE OR LESS REMOTE THAT IS TO BE ATTAINED THROUGH A SERIES OF EFFORTS THERE IS NOTHING MARKEDLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN WHAT WE ARE TODAY CALLING PROPER MOTIVATION AND WHAT THE OLDER WRITERS UPON SCHOOL MAN AGEMENT DISCUSSED UNDER THE HEAD OF INCENTIVES INDEED WHITES CLASSIFICATION OF INCENTIVES AS NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL MIGHT WELL SERVE AS THE TEXT FOR A PRESENTDAY SERMON UPON PROPER 79THE SCHOOL REVIEW MOTIVATION OF SCHOOL WORK WE ARE HOWEVER APPROACHING THE SUBJECT FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE AND IN THE LIGHT OF BROADER PRINCIPLES IT HAS BEEN URGED THAT THE MOTIVES THAT DOMINATE THE PUPIL IN THE MASTERY OF KNOWLEDGE OR IN THE ACQUISITION OF HABIT DE TERMINE THE EFFICIENCY OF THAT KNOWLEDGE OR HABIT IN SERVING AS AN INSTRUMENT IN THE SOLUTION OF LATER PROBLEMS THIS IS THE POSSIBILITY OF CONNECTING KNOWLEDGE OR HABIT WITH THE REAL PROB LEMS OF LATER LIFE WILL BE THE GREATER THE MORE CLOSELY THE INITIAL MASTERY OF KNOWLEDGE OR HABIT HAS BEEN RELATED TO SIMILAR VITAL PROBLEMS IT IS GENERALLY AGREED FOR EXAMPLE THAT A PUPIL WHO LEARNS TO SPELL OR TO COMPOSE OR TO COMPUTE BECAUSE HE APPRE CIATES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SPELLING OR COMPOSITION OR COMPUTA TION IN SOLVING REAL LIFEPROBLEMS WILL FIND A MUCH MORE EX TENDED APPLICATION FOR THESE ARTS THAN ONE WHO HAS MASTERED THEM ARBITRARILY WHILE I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS MUCH TO BE COMMENDED IN THIS ARGUMENT ITS FORCE IS SOMEWHAT WEAKENED BY CERTAIN WELL KNOWN FACTS EXPERIENCE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT SOME FACTS AND SOME HABITS ACQUIRED WITHOUT PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO WHAT WE TERM REAL LIFEPROBLEMS ARE STILL AVAILABLE FOR LATER USE INDEED NATURE ITSELF THROUGH THE INSTINCTS OF CURIOSITY PLAY AND REPE TITION HAS PROVIDED FOR THE ACQUISITION OF USEFUL INFORMATION AND USEFUL HABITS AT A TIME WHEN THE CHILD HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST CONCEPTION OF THEIR TRUE FUNCTION WATCH A LITTLE TWOYEAROLD CATCH A WORD THAT HE HEARS AND REPEAT IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THE MERE DELIGHT THAT THE REPETITION AFFORDS HE IS UNDER GOING A DRILL PROCESS WHICH HAS TO HIS CONSCIOUSNESS NO SIG NIFICANCE ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT IT SATISFIES AN IMMEDIATE AND INSTINCTIVE DESIRE AND YET THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT HE IS MASTERING AND REDUCING TO AUTOMATIC CONTROL ARE VERY OBVIOUSLY OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN LATER SITUATIONS I CONFESS THAT I HAVE FOUND NO LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN HARMONIZING THESE INSTINCTIVE TENDENCIES WITH THAT DOCTRINE OF MOTIVATION WHICH INSISTS THAT HABITS AND KNOWLEDGE GAINED OUTSIDE THE MA TRIX OF REAL LIFEPROBLEMS WILL NOT FUNCTION LATER WITH REFERENCE TO SUCH PROBLEMS NATURE WITH ITS ADAPTIVE INSTINCTS OF PLAY 80ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS AND HIGHSCHOOL WORK CURIOSITY AND IMITATIVE REPETITION SEEMS TO HAVE DECREED OTHER WISE AND TO HAVE EXECUTED THIS DECREE WITH MARKED EFFICIENCY MY OWN SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM MAY NOT APPEAL TO YOU AS CONVINCING BUT I SHALL GIVE IT TO YOU FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH I BELIEVE THAT AS MANY OF THE ESSENTIAL HABITS AS POSSIBLE SHOULD BE FIXED THROUGH THE OPERATION OF THE NATIVE INSTINCTS WITHOUT GOING OUT OF OUR WAY TO SEARCH FOR MORE INVOLVED MOTIVES IT IS MUCH SIMPLER AND I BELIEVE NO LESS EFFECTIVE TO HAVE MANY OF THE SIMPLER NUMBER AND LANGUAGE HABITS MASTERED IN THIS WAY THAN IT IS TO LEAD THE CHILD THROUGH A COMPLICATED PROCESS OF REASONING TO SEE THE UTILITY OF THESE HABITS IN SOLVING WHAT WE CALL REAL PROBLEMS AND SIMILARLY I BELIEVE THAT WHEREVER NATIVE CURIOSITY WILL SERVE TO FIX FACTS OR FORM AN APPROACH TO PRINCIPLES OF EXPLANATION IT IS WISE ECONOMY TO LAY HOLD OF THIS CURIOSITY AND WORK IT FOR ALL THAT IT IS WORTH THERE COMES A TIME HOWEVER WHEN NATIVE INTEREST FLAGS THE MORE COMPLICATED HABITGROUPS CAN SELDOM BE ADEQUATELY MASTERED IN THIS WAY THE DELIGHT IN REPETITION COMES TO AN END BEFORE AUTOMATIC CONTROL HAS BEEN ACQUIRED IT IS THEN THAT THE REAL WORTH OF THE HABIT SHOULD BE UTILIZED IF POSSIBLE TO MOTIVATE ITS MASTERY IT IS THEN THAT THE PUPIL SHOULD BE LED TO SEE THAT UNDERGOING THE DISCIPLINE OF REPETITION RESULTS IN A MASTERY THAT IS UNEQUIVOCALLY OF SERVICE TO HIM IF WE CAN INSURE THIS RECOGNITION OF THE WORTHWHILENESS OF THE DISCIPLINE WE ARE DOING SOMETHING MORE THAN MAKING OUR DRILLPROCESS EFFECTIVE AND ECONOMICAL AS SUCH WE ARE TEACHING THE PUPIL THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL LESSONS GENIUS SAYS GEORGE ELIOT IS LITTLE MORE THAN A GREAT CAPACITY FOR RECEIVING DISCIPLINE AND WE MAY SUPPLEMENT THIS BY SAYING THAT DISCIPLINE IS DOING THINGS THAT WE DO NOT WISH TO DO FOR THE SAKE OF ATTAINING AN END THAT IS WORTH WHILE WE CANNOT MAKE ALL OF OUR PUPILS INTO GENIUSES BUT WE CAN INCREASE OUR PUPILS CAPACITY FOR DISCIPLINE IF THROUGH SHOWING THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE WORTHWHILENESS OF SUSTAINED EFFORT WE CAN GET THEM TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES MORE WILLINGLY TO DISCIPLINARY PROCESSES WE SHALL DO MUCH TOWARD INCREASING THE SUMTOTAL OF HUMAN ACHIEVEMENT 8ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW THE OLDER EDUCATION WAS OFTEN BLIND TO THIS POSSIBILITY IT REQUIRED REPETITION FAR BEYOND THE POINT WHERE REPETITION IS AN INSTINCTIVE DELIGHT BUT IT DID NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THE IM PORTANCE OF CONVINCING THE PUPIL THAT THIS REPETITION REALLY ISSUED IN INCREASED POWER REALLY CONTRIBUTED TO HIS ABILITY TO SOLVE PROB LEMS IT IS BECAUSE THE MODERN DOCTRINE OF MOTIVATION IMPELS THE TEACHER TO SEARCH FOR ENDS OR MOTIVES THE REALIZATION OF WHICH WILL IN THE END JUSTIFY AN ARDUOUS PROCESS OF DISCIPLINE THAT IT APPEALS TO ME INTERPRETED IN THIS WAY IT IS THE VERY OPPOSITE OF THE SUGARCOATING PROCESS AGAINST WHICH ALL OF US HAVE A MOST JUSTIFIABLE PREJUDICE TO LEAD THE CHILD TO THINK THE THINGS IN LIFE THAT ARE MOST WORTH DOING ARE EASY TO DO IS TO TEACH HIM A LIEA LIE WHICH MANY UNFORTUNATE CHILDREN HAVE HAD TO UNLEARN THROUGH THE BITTER EXPERIENCE OF LATER YEARS BUT THE DOCTRINE OF MOTIVATION DOES NOT MEAN SUGARCOATING IT DOES NOT MEAN GIVING THE PUPIL THE IMPRESSION THAT GOOD THINGS COME WITHOUT EFFORT IT RATHER SANCTIONS EFFORT BY BRINGING THE EFFORT INTO AN INTIMATE RELATION WITH THE RESULTS PROPERLY APPLIED IT WILL LEAD THE PUPIL TO LOOK UPON HIS OWN LITTLE ACHIEVEMENTS AS TYPES OF ALL ACHIEVEMENTWILL LEAD HIM TO SEE THAT PEARY CONQUERING THE POLE OR WILBUR WRIGHT CONSTRUCTING THE AEROPLANE OR MORSE STRUGGLING THROUGH LONG YEARS OF POV ERTY AND SUFFERING TO PERFECT THE TELEGRAPH UNDERWENT EXPERIENCES THAT DIFFER ONLY IN DEGREE AND NOT IN KIND FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THE SCHOOL THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SCHOOL AND LIFE SYNONYMOUS IN THE TRUE SENSE FOR THE ESSENTIAL WORTH OF HUMAN LIFE IS STRUGGLE AND SELFSACRIFICE AND THE SUBORDINATION OF IMME DIATE DESIRE TO ULTIMATE PURPOSE THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE VERY FACT THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL PREPARES FOR COLLEGE GIVES TO MANY PUPILS AN INCREASED RESPECT FOR THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL A RESPECT WHICH IN ITSELF ADDS TO THE CONVICTION THAT ITS MASTERY IS WORTH WHILE BUT THIS MOTIVE SHOULD BE PURELY SUPPLE MENTARY AND NOT FUNDAMENTAL THE GREAT DEFECT OF MUCH OF OUR PRESENTDAY TEACHING IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE LOOKED UPON BY THE TEACHERS IN AN ARBITRARY WAY THAT IS THE TEACHING AIMS 82ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS AND HIGHSCHOOL WORK ONLY AT SUCH MASTERY AS SHALL FULFIL FORMAL ENTRANCE REQUIRE MENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY MISSES MANY OF THE RICH VALUES WHICH THESE STUDIES MIGHT REALIZE THE SPUR OF ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE AN ACCESSORY MNOTIVE BOTH TO THE PUPIL AND TO THE TEACHER AND WHEN THE PUPIL REACHES COLLEGE HE SHOULD FIND AS I FEAR HE DOES NOT ALWAYS FIND TODAY THAT THE WORK HE HAS DONE REALLY PREPARES HIM FOR COLLEGE WORKTHAT THERE IS A REAL ARTICULATION SOMETIMES I THINK THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS COME TO BELIEVE THAT MUCH OF THEIR HIGHSCHOOL WORK HAS NOT HELPED THEM TO A MASTERY OF THE COLLEGE SITUATIONTHAT MANY OF THE COURSES WHICH THEY TAKE IN COLLEGE COULD BE COMPLETED WITHOUT THE PRE LIMINARY HIGHSCHOOL TRAINING THE EFFECT OF SUCH A CONCLUSION IS OBVIOUSLY TO DEFEAT THE GROWTH OF THE PREJUDICES IN FAVOR OF WORK AND EFFORT THIS IS A SORT OF GOLDBRICK GAME THAT EDU CATION HAS PLAYED TOO MANY TIMES AND IT SUGGESTS AGAIN THE CRYING NEED FOR A PENETRATING STUDY OF EDUCATIONAL VALUES ESPE CIALLY IN THIS DAY OF THE WIDE EXTENSION IN THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM AND THE GROWING TENDENCY TO ABANDON THE NOTION THAT THE BEST TYPE OF EDUCATION MUST BE ARTICULATED FROM START TO FINISH WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE AND ONE THAT IS LIKELY TO CAUSE EDUCATION NO END OF TROUBLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE I FEEL THAT SO RAMBLING A DISCUSSION AS I HAVE INDULGED IN DEMANDS WHATEVER JUSTIFICATION A SUMMARY MAY FURNISH I AT TEMPTED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO MAKE CLEAR MY CONCEPTION OF THE TERM COLLEGE DOMINATION I MAINTAINED THAT THIS DOMINATION MAY BE OF TWO TYPES FIRST THE EXPLICIT DICTATION OF HIGHSCHOOL POLICIES BY COLLEGE AUTHORITIES AND SECONDLY THE INDIRECT CONTROL OF THE HIGHSCHOOL SITUATION BY THE COLLEGE THROUGH THE TEACHERS WHICH IT FURNISHES I MAINTAINED THAT THE FIRST TYPE OF DOMINA TION IS NOT NOW A SERIOUS MENACE IN THE MIDDLE WEST BECAUSE OF THE DISPOSITION OF COLLEGE AND HIGHSCHOOL MEN TO GET TOGETHER IN CONFERENCES AND WORK OUT THE PROBLEMS EACH RECOGNIZING THE IDEALS OF THE OTHER I MAINTAINED THAT SOME MEASURE OF VALUE ATTACHES TO THE WISE PRESCRIPTION OF COLLEGEENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS IN THAT IT FURNISHES A CHECK OR CONTROL UPON THE LOCAL DEMANDS WHICH MAY BE MADE UPON THE HIGH SCHOOL AND WHICH SHOULD OF COURSE BE THE PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IN CONSTRUCTING THE CURRIC 83THE SCHOOL REVIEW ULUM I MAINTAINED THAT THE SECOND TYPE OF COLLEGE DOMINA TION IS A SERIOUS MENACE TO SECONDARYSCHOOL EDUCATION AND THAT THIS DOMINATION WILL CONTINUE SO LONG AS THE FACTOR OF PROFES SIONAL TRAINING IS NEGLECTED IN THE PREPARATION OF SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS I MAINTAINED THAT MOTIVATION FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF INCREASING THE INSTRUMENTAL VALUE OF HABITS AND KNOWLEDGE IS IMPORTANT BUT THAT IT ALSO HAS ITS LIMITATIONS AND THAT THE FIELD FOR MOTIVATION LIES IN THE MASTERY OF COMPLICATED HABITS AND INVOLVED TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE WHERE THE INSTINCTS OF REPETITION AND CURIOSITY NO LONGER OPERATE EFFECTIVELY I MAIN TAINED THAT PROPER MOTIVATION IN THESE PHASES OF EDUCATION WILL HELP NOT ONLY IN THE SPECIFIC MASTERY OF HABITS AND KNOWLEDGE BUT ALSO IN ENGENDERING IN THE PUPILS EFFECTIVE IDEALS OF EFFORT AND PERSISTENCE BY DEMONSTRATING TO THEM THE ESSENTIAL WORTH OF THESE VIRTUES I MAINTAINED FINALLY THAT ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS MAY PROFITABLY FUNCTION AS MOTIVES BUT THAT THEY SHOULD BE SUBSIDIARY AND NOT PRIMARY MOTIVES AND THAT THE AIM OF BOTH TEACHER AND PUPIL IN THE HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD BE PRIMARILY TO REALIZE THE INTRINSIC VALUES WHICH THE SUBJECTMATTER POSSESSES 84

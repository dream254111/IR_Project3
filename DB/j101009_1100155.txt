CONTENTS should be addressed to the EDITOR at Richmond Va BUSINEss communications to the PUBLISHERS In the death of Edmund Christian Minor Judge of the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond at Norwich Connecticut on the ninth day of September 1903 in the fiftyninth year of his age we have to record the loss of an upright man a Edmund faithful officer a firm friend For many years Christian Minor judge of the County Court of Henrico county he was upon the creation of the Law and Equity Court of Rich moiid in 1894 made its judge In the course of his long judicial service he endeared himself to every member of his bar Courtesy and consideration qualities essential to the ideal judge were in him ever abundant One who had made a losing fight in his court after a hard battle rarely failed to receive a commendatory word His nature was frank and generous his manner upon the bench atten tive and his capacity for the hard work of his court limited only by physical bounds There can be no question that as in the case of Judge James C Lamb of the Chancery Court of Richmond the breakdown which preceded death was the proximate result of heavy judicial labors His intercourse with the members of his bar was always unre strained but he had no favorites The trend of his mind seemed to be in the direction of eliciting the facts by the simplest methods and applying to them the equity of the law and attorney and client whether successful or otherwise always left his court impressed with the fairness of the man his willingness to be convinced and his slrong desire that only justice should be done It was of such a man that Horace wrote Justum et tennacem propositi virum and the words are no less true of him who has left us1903 EDITORIAL 565 At the request of the bar of the City of Richmond Governor Mlontague has appointed John H Ingram Esq of the Richmond Bar as the successor of Judge Minor Judge Ingram has been for a score of years Judge of the Corporation Court of Man ongrHm chester Richmonds sister city but has all that time prac Ingramtised in the courts of Richmond He took high place in the Constitutional Convention of 19012 and now assumes the duties of his new office with a wellearned reputation as a man at torney legislator and judge At the September 1903 terin of the Court of Appeals at Staunton the number of cases on the docket was fiftyone in twentyone of which final judgments were rendered Two were re moved to Richmond and eighteen were continued for Fai t o failure to print the records This large percentageover Print fortythreesuggests the suspicion that the failure to print might have been in some of the cases intentional and for the purpose of vexatious delay The law as it now stands permits a case to remain for three years on the docket of the court at Staun ton and Wytheville at each of which places the court holds but one term annually This cannot occur at Richmond  with its three terms a year We understand that a correction of this abuse will be sought at the ensuing session of the legislature We are always in the field for leading articles from competent writers for publication in these pages They add much to the value of a law journal being read by all who are interested in the sub Leading Articles ject with a degree of attention proportioned to that interest be it general or special We solicit therefore from the members of the profession con tributions to the common stock of law knowledge We might safely leave the question of the structure of such articles to the experience and judgment of the writer but a few words indicative of our ideas of what we desire in them may not be inappropriate In the first place let them be upon practical themes of presernt importance The theory of existence of the REGISTER has ever been that of usefulness to the profession more especially to the practi tioner Under its present plan of publishing all the opinions of the Court of Appeals of Virginia its space for other kinds of matter566 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct is necessarily limited For detailed discussions of the civil or canon law alleged solutions of the trust problem and his torical and philosophical matter generallyall interesting enough under other circumstanceswe have not sufficient space This ap plies also to extended criticisms of the opinions of the courts Their judgments whether right or wrong are the law and petitions for rehearing must be addressed to them If lengthy appeals or pro tests are to be taken to the profession or the public from the refusal to rehear meritorious as at times they may be and unsatisfying as they usually areit must be through a channel other than the REGISTER Such papers naturally invite defences of the opin ion by other lawyers and these in turn rejoinders until the gen eral reader loses sight of what was decided and no result other than confusion is attained It will be noted that we have spoken only of extended discussions of this nature Concise reviews of decisions of interest will always be welcome and will promptly ap pear in our pages The question with us is one of space Again in the preparation of leading articles we desire at least a modicum of originalitythe writers own views It is not a diffi cult thing today with the encyclopvedias and digests supplied to us all upon easy terms by confiding publishers to prepare a paper upon a given subject The cases from the several courts for and against the proposition can be stated at greater or less length and what may be called a skeleton of a good article will be the result But far more valuable will the result be if instead of stopping with the mining of the ore the laborer will go on to refine the mineral and make it to bear the impression of his own personality by a wellcon sidered expression of his opinion of the merits of the general ques tion It is true that this will subject his views to the risk of criti cism but he runs this risk in his practice every day In a word the judge or lawyer who leans too heavily upon the crutch of pre cedent suggests his own lameness and when precedent fails nec essarily halts with it while he who uses it only as he observes the foundation and proper limitations of his theme and then devotes himself to the application of principles to facts begets the forceful ness of style which is always incident to original thought Upon this point we summarize state the law as propounded by court or legislature but add to it just comment of approval or condemna tion with succinct reasons therefor1903 EDITORIAL 567 The history of current jurisprudence would not be complete with out at least a mention of the acquittal at Lexington South Carolina on the 15th inst of exLieutenant Governor James H Tillman The upon an indictment for the murder in February last Till C of N G Gonzales editor of the Columbia State W0rhile the verdict is a source of profound discourage ment to all who wish to see the standard at which human life is held in the South materially elevated it is only fair to state that this miscarriage of justice was the work of the jury and not the court The law could not have been more clearly defined in England or New Jersey in either of which jurisdictions murder is notably held to require more than an apology to the jury Further the courts did their duty by refusing an application for bail made with astounding confidence soon after the homicide The prisoner put himself upon the country with a result which showed that his faith in its precedents and traditions was not misplaced A just inference from the verdict would seem to be that in South Carolina the fact that a man who having previously publicly offended another ap proaches him on the street with his hands in his overcoat pockets the thumbs being at first exposed but later removed to the pockets may be shot down by that other without fear of anything beyond the annoyance and expense of a trial and thd inconvenience and loss of time incident to confinement in jail until acquittal In the Haywood case in North Carolina a large measure of the responsibility for the prisoners acquittal rests if we are correctly informed by the daily press with the trial judge who is declared among other rulings to have rebuked the prosecution for endeavor ing to prove malice and motive Cases like these reduce man slaughter to mans laughter In this number we report two cases from courts of first instance in this state which we consider of sufficient interest to call for pre sentation to the profession the members of which would not other  r wise be advised of them We propose to continue this Decin course from time to time especially in regard to cases oecsi in which the Supreme Court of Appeals has upon appli cation refused an appeal In Baker v Watts reported in this number the court expressly rules that the refusal of an appeal from a decree adjudicating the principles of a chancery cause is an affirm568 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct ance of such decree and puts at rest the questions so adjudicated and they cannot thereafter be reopened We expect to report in a later issue a decision by Judge E W Saunders in the Circuit Court of Campbell county adjudging in proceedings under section 1698 of the Code for the appointment of a committee of an insaneperson the necessity of notice to the insane person himself also the case of Commonwealth v King from the Hustings Court of the City of Richmond upon a conviction of bribery In that case the lower court passed upon important questions such as the competency of a grand juror under the Constitution of 1902Athe propriety of a stenographer in the grand jury room the degree of weight to be given to the testimony of an accomplice who admits perjury before the grand jury finding the indictment and whether a question on direct examination by the attorney for the Commonwealth so framed as to include the essential features of the indictment and capable of being met with the answer Yes or No is or is not a leading question To the judgment upon these and other questions a writ of error was refused and the case for the novelty of its facts in Virginia and the interesting character of its legal questions should be reported In Pennsylvania and other states there are publications devoted entirely to the decisions of inferior courts gen erally upon questions of practice in which poinits of moment are passecl upon which never reach the Supreme Court and yet are most acceptable to bench and bar Of course when these cases are car ried to a higher tribunal which refuses to interfere they possess an added weight and the value of their publication is manifest

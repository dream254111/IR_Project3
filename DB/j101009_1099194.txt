December 6 1897,i245843,STEWART V B  a R CO SurtEEME COURT OF THE UNlTID STATES THOMAS W STEWART Administrator of the estate of John Andrew Casey Plaintiff in Error V THE BALTIMORE  OHIO RAILROAD COMPANY December 6 1897 1 Action for wrongful death is not a purely statutory right Such a wrong ex cept for the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona was actionable at common law In this respect the action differs from a statutory proceeding on a purely statutory delict 2 Where a statute giving an action for wrongful death in the State in which the cause of action arose is not in substance inconsistent with the statutes or public policy of the State in which the right of action is sought to be en forced the action may be maintained in the latter State 3 In Maryland an action for wrongful death is required to be brought in the name of the State and the damages recovered are distributed amongst the wife husband parent and child of the deceased in such shares as the jury shall direct In the District of Columbia the action is required to be brought by the personal representative of the deceased and the damages recovered enure to the benefit of his or her family according to the provisions of the statute of distributions Held The statutes are not so inconsistent as to pre vent an action from being maintained in the District of Columbia for death occurring in Maryland In error to the Couft of Appeals of the District of Columbia sus taining a demurrer to the plaintiffs declaration Reversed Statement by Mr Justice BREWER On October 22 1894 plaintiff in error as plaintiff filed in the Su preme Court of the District of Columbia an amended declaration con taining two counts The first alleged that John Andrew Casey plaintiffs intestate was killed through the negligence of the defendant company in the State of Maryland that said intestate left surviving no parent or child but only his wife Alice Triplett Casey for whose benefit this action was brought The second count set forth in addition to the matters disclosed in the first a statute of the State of Maryland in respect to recovery in such cases A demurrer to this declaration was sustained and judgment entered for defendant This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia and from such judgment of affirmance plaintiff has brought the case here on error 1898 645VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER The statute in force in the District of Columbia 23 Stat 307 pro vides for recovery in case the act causing death is done within the limits of the District of Columbia that the person who or corpora tion which would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages for such death notwithstanding the death of the person injured that the recovery shall not exceed 10000 that the action shall be brought in the name of the personal representative of the deceased and within one year after his death and that the damages recovered shall not be appropriated to the pay ment of the debts of the deceased but enure to the benefit of his or her family and be distributed according to the provisions of the statute of distributions The Maryland statute which is copied in the declara tion Rev Code Maryland 1878 p 724 provides in the first sec tion that whenever the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act negligence c of another the person who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages Sections 2 and 3 are as follows  SEC 2 Every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife husband parent and child of the person whose death shall have been so caused and shall be brought by and in the name of the State of Maryland for the use of the person entitled to damages and in every such action the jury may give such damages as they think proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought and the amount so recovered after deducting the costs npt recovered from the defendant shall be divided amongst the abovementioned parties in such shares as the jury by their verdict shall find and direct Provided That not more than one action shall lie for and in respect of the same subjectmatter of complaint and that every such action shall be commenced within twelve calendar months after the death of the deceased person SEC 3 In every such action the equitable plaintiff on the record shall be re quired together with the declaration to deliver to the defendant or his attorney a full particular of the persons for whom and on whose behalf such action shall be brought and of the nature of the claim in respect of which damages shall be sought to be recovered Mr Justice BREWER delivered the opinion of the court The Court of Appeals was of opinion that the action could not be maintained under the statute of the District of Columbia because that authorizes recovery only in case the injury causing death is done within the limits of the District nor under the Maryland statute be cause of the peculiar form of remedy prescribed therein citing in support of the latter contention Pollard v Bailey 20 Wall 520 A 646 JanSTEWART V B  O R CO statute of Alabama made stockholders of a bank individually liable for its debts and according to the construction given to it by the Su preme Court of the State the remedy provided was a suit in equity whereas in that case a single creditor had sued one of the stockholders in an action at law and in denying the right to maintain such action this court observed page 526 The individual liability of stockholders in a corporation for the payment of its debts is always a creature of statute At common law it does not exist The statute which creates it may also declare the purposes of its creation and provide for the manner of its enforcement    The liability and the remedy were created by the same statute This being so the remedy provided is exclusive of all others A general liability created by statute withouta remedy may be en forced by an appropriate common law action But where the provision for the liability is coupled with a provision for a special remedy that remedy and that alone must be employed To like effect was cited Fourth National Bank v Francklyn 120 U S 747 The Court of Appeals was of opinion that the statute in Maryland not only created a statutory liability but prescribed a particular remedy and that no action could be maintained either in Maryland or elsewhere unless that special remedy was pursued Notwithstanding the ability with which the arguments in support of this conclusion are presented in the opinion of the Court of Appeals we are unable to concur therein A negligent act causing death is in itself a tort and were it not for the rule founded on the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona damages therefor could have been re covered in an action at common law The case differs in this import ant feature from those in which a penalty is imposed for an act in itself not wrongful in which a purely statutory delict is created The pur pose of the several statutes passed in the States in more or less con formity to what is known as Lord Campbells Act is to provide the means for recovering the damages caused by that which is essentially and in its nature a tort Such statutes are not penal but remedial for the benefit of the persons injured by the death An action to recover damages for a tort is not local but transitory and can as a general rule be maintained wherever the wrongdoer can be found Dennick v Railroad Company 103 US 11 It may well be that where a purely statutory right is created the special remedy provided by the statute for the enforcement of that right must be pursued but where the statute simply takes awlay a common law obstacle to a re covery for an admitted tort it would seem not unreasonable to hold 1898 647VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER that an action for that tort can be maintained in any State in which that common law obstacle has been removed At least it has been held by this court in repeated cases that an action for such a tort can be maintained  wheire the statute of the State in which the cause of action arose is not in substance inconsistent with the statutes or public policy of the State in which the right of action is sought to be en forced Texas  Pacific Ry Co v Cox 145 U S 593 605 See also Dennick v Railroad Company 103 U S 11 fHuntington v Attrill 146 U S 657 Northern Pacific R R Co v Babcock 154 U  9S 0 What are the differences between the two statutes  As heretofore noticed the substantial purpose of these various statutes is to do away with the obstacle to a recovery caused by the death of the party in jured Both statutes in the case at bar disclose that purpose By each the death of the party injured ceases to relieve the wrongdoer from liability for damages caused by the death and this is its main purpose and effect The two statutes differ as to the party in whose name the suit is to be brought In Maryland the plaintiff is the State in this District the personal representative of the deceased But neither the State in the one case nor the personal representative in the other has any pecuniary interest in the recovery Each is simply a nominal plaintiff While in the District the nominal plaintiff is the personal representative of the deceased the damages recovered do not become part of the assets of the estate or liable for the debts of the deceased but are distributed among certain of his heirs By neither statute is there any thought of increasing the volume of the deceaseds estate but in each it is the award to certain prescribed heirs of the damages resulting to them from the taking away of their relative For purposes of jurisdiction in the Federal courts regard is had to the real rather than to the nominal party Brown v Strode 5 Cranch 303 lMcNutt v Bland 2 How 9 State of Maryland for use of Markley v Baldwin 112 U S 490 See also Gaither v Farmers  Mechanics Bank of Georgetown 1 Pet 37 42 in which the issue submitted to the jury was as stated one between the bank to the use of Thomas Corcorran plaintiff and Gaither the defendant upon which the court said  This practice is familiar with the Maryland courts and when the action originates in that form the cestui que use is regarded as the real party to the suit It is true those were ac tions on contract and this is an action for a tort but still in such an action it is evident that the real party in interest is not the nominal 648 Janplaintiff but the party for whose benefit the recovery is sought and the courts of either jurisdiction will see that the damages awarded pass to such party Another difference is that by the Maryland statute the jury trying the cause apportion the damages awarded between the parties for whose benefit the action is brought while by the statute of the District the distribution is made according to the ordinary laws of distribution of a decedents estate But by each the important matter is the award of damages and the manner of distribution is a minor con sideration Besides in determining the amount of the recovery the jury must necessarily consider the damages which each beneficiary has sustained by reason of the death By neither statute is a fixed sum to be given as a penalty for the wrong but in each the question is the amount of damages It is true that the beneficiaries of such an ac tion may not in every case be exactly the same under each statute but the principal beneficiaries under each are the near relatives those most likely to be dependent on the party killed and the remote rela tives can seldom if ever be regarded as suffering loss from the death We cannot think that these differences are sufficient to render the statute of Maryland in substance inconsistent with the statute or public policy of the District of Columbia and so within the rule heretofore announced in this court it must be held that the plaintiff was entitled to maintain this action in the courts of the District for the benefit of the persons designated in the statute of Maryland The judgment will be reversed and the case remanded for a trial upon the merits Reversed 1898 649 STEWART V B  O R CO

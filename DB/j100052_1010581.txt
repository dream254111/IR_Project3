j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1010581,Federal Control of Interstate Commerce,i242570,FEDERAL CONTROL OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE BY HARRY EARL MONTGOMERY Buffalo N Y The Republican administration voicing the demand of the American people has determined to give to the federal government power to regulate and control corporations engaged in interstate commerce The various plans presented and the bills introduced at the last session of Congress have been criticised so severely by students of economics that the first lesson in remedial legislation is being learnedthe lesson of what not to do So clearly have the defects of the proposed remedies been shown that a straight and narrow pathway is appearing which will lead unless blocked by political or other influences to the passage of a law which will pre serve the good features and at the same time eliminate the evils now existing in corporations engaged in interstate trade The bidding of the states for the chartering of corporations has created a body of laws which confer great powerspowers our fore fathers never dreamed would be given to any group of individuals to those who are willing to pay a small incorporation tax in exchange for such privileges So little supervision and control are now exer cised by the state governments that corporations are able through the secrecy which surrounds their actions to override the law and to some extent to be creatures subject only to the wishes and desires of the corporate managers The futility of state control has become so apparent that much against their wishes our people are com pelled to turn for protection to the federal government The constitution of the United States by the third clause of Article I Section VIII has reserved to Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and has thereby vested in Congress the power to enact laws which will adequately control and regulate the agencies engaged in interstate trade So well convinced are the authorities at Wash 642Federal Control of Interstate Commerce ington that Congress possesses such power that Commissioner Gar field of the Bureau of Corporations in his first report has said that It may be considered as established that under these consti tutional powers Congress may I Create corporations as a means of regulating interstate commerce 2 Give to such corporations the power to engage in inter state or foreign commerce 3 Prohibit any other corporations or individuals from engag ing in the same 4 As a condition precedent to the grant of such corporate powers lay any restrictions it chooses upon the organizations con duct or management of such corporation 5 Tax interstate commerce at will and the instrumentalities and corporations engaged therein 6 Provide regulations for the carrying on of interstate com merce generally and in such local affairs as are now left to the states in the silence of Congress under the principle established in Cooley vs Port Wardens I2 How 299 and in the carrying out of such powers it may use any or all means which are appropriate which are plainly adapted to that end which are not prohibited but consistent with the letter and spirit of the constitution Congress having the power to act and the administration having determined that such power shall be used to the curbing of cor porate greed and corporate discrimination it becomes the duty of every American to give his best thought to the consideration of the plans suggested in order that the combined wisdom of the American people may be brought to bear on the preparation of a federal incor poration act To such an end the following plan is presented as a contribution to this discussion First The power and authority of the Bureau of Corporations in the Department of Commerce and Labor should be enlarged so as to include the right to grant charters of incorporation to all who seek to engage in interstate or foreign commerce This bureau should not only have this power but all corporations joint stock companies and other forms of organizations now existing or which hereinafter may be chartered by a state government should be prohibited from engaging in interstate and foreign commerce until chartered by this bureau Unless this bureau has the sole right to 643 31The Annals of the American Academy incorporate associations engaged in interstate or foreign commerce the effect of this plan would be defeated Subcompanies would be organized in the different states with or without the intervention of a holding company and would not be subject to the control and regulation of this bureau This bureau should have not only the sole right to incorporate associations engaged in interstate and foreign commerce but it should have absolute charge and complete control of its corporate children Second Every corporation incorporated by this bureau should pay an organization tax of onetenth of one per cent upon the amount of capital stock authorized and a like tax upon any sub sequent issue The average organization tax in the various states is about onetenth of one per cent Experience has shown that this is the rate which incorporators are willing to pay for the privilege of owning a corporate charter and the amount that should be charged for giving such privilege The incorporation tax should be so low as to deter no group of men from carrying on business in a corporate capacity for it is to corporations with their large aggregation of capital that we must look for the development of our country Corporations when backed by large capital expert skill and great business ability have often conferred material benefit on the community at large and almost invariably insured the promotion of prosperity on a durable basis They have furnished the people with many of the commodi ties of civilized existence at much lower prices than formerly not only without decreasing the wages of labor but in many instances increasing them and eventually extending the field for a larger number of employees India rubber goods tobacco leather and a great variety of other commodities are cheaper than at any former period of our countrys existence and wages are higher today than they have ever been except in war times Without cor porations the great railway systems of our country could not have obtained the capital required to cover our land with a network of rails and could not carry freight and passengers at the low rates charged today Without corporations our manuafacturers could not compete with the corporations of England France and Germany in the race 644 32Federal Control of Interstate Commerce for the Asiatic and the South American markets To extend our markets and thereby provide an outlet for our surplus products and thus give constant employment to our workers and toilers is the crying necessity of our economic life and in order to obtain these markets giant corporations must be met and conquered by more powerful and far greater aggregations of capital organized in the form of corporations Third The stockholders and directors of corporations organized under the Corporation Bureau should be personally liable only to the following extent The stockholders should be personally liable a To creditors to an amount equal to the amount unpaid on the stock held by each stockholder b To the laborers servants and employees other than con tractors for services performed by them for such corporation The directors should be personally liable a For declaring dividends from any fund other than from the surplus profits arising from the business of the corporation b For loaning corporation money to any stockholder or con senting to the corporation discounting any note or other evidence of debt c For violating any of the provisions of this act or any law of the United States The liability of stockholders and directors of corporations except for violations of law or breach of trust should be so limited as to deter no one from contributing his money to corporate enter prises The provisions of this plan provide sufficient protection to creditors and to the general public and no additional burdens to those hereinbefore set forth need be placed on corporate stockholders and corporate directors Fourth The real and tangible personal property owned by corporations chartered by this bureau should be locally assessed and taxed in the civic divisions of the states in which the property is located the same as the real and personal property owned by individuals No higher or different rate of taxation and no other or different method of assessment should be applied to such corpo rations than is applied to corporations organized unler the state law or to individual citizens The reason for such local taxation is twofold First the local 645 33The Annals of the American Academy authorities have a better knowledge of the value of property and better facilities for obtaining this knowledge and would therefore make fewer mistakes than a board of examiners appointed from Washington and not residents of the locality where such property is located secondly the cities and counties of the states depend largely for their support upon the taxes levied upon the property of cor porations located within their jurisdiction and to withdraw this revenue would cause confusion and would increase the burdens of the local taxpayers Fifth Every prospectus or advertisement issued or published with a view of obtaining subscriptions for shares or for bonds of a corporation organized or to be organized by this bureau should give full details as to its organization the contracts into which the promoters or organizers have entered the earnings for the two previous years of all underlying corporations the amount of money to be used for preliminary expenses and the amount to be reserved for working capital and all information necessary for safe and in telligent investment For a false statement or the issuing of a prospectus which does not make a full disclosure of the corporate affairs the promoters and their associates the officers and their agents should be legally liable both civilly and criminally This knowledge is at present inaccessible The investor who puts money into a giant corporation must guess as best he can what property he is getting and the guess is often a bad one for him The making public of the abovementioned facts will remove the gravest evils from stockwatering If the investor knows that there is only one dollar of property back of every three dollars of stock and bonds which is the case with so many corporations whose shares are listed at the exchanges today he can buy the securities at a discount sufficient to make his investment safe When appeals are made to the public to subscribe to the capital of undertakings it should be made obligatory on the corporate pro moters organizers and officers to disclose every fact known to them and unknown to the public in order that everything be open and above board and the parties public and promoters alike may deal with equal information in regard to the organization and the conduct of such companies Corporations now in existence and engaged in interstate or foreign trade and desiring to obtain a charter from this bureau r646 34Federal Control of Interstate Commerce should furnish to the commissioner a detailed history of its organiza tion and an itemized list of its assets and liabilities a summary statement of which should be published in such newspapers as may be designated by the commissioner By the possession of this report the bureau will be placed in the position by which it could investi gate intelligently the affairs of the corporation and be able rightly to supervise its future corporate life Sixth Every corporation should annually during the month of January make and file with the corporation department a state ment as of the first day of January verified by the oath of its president or vicepresident and its secretary or treasurer fully set ting forth the following information I The name of the corporation and the place and date of its incorporation 2 The names residence and business or occupation of the officers and directors of the corporation 3 The business in which the corporation is actually en gaged and the states territories districts or insular possessions in which it is engaged in transacting such business specifying a person residing in each such state and territory who shall be designated by such corporation as its legal representative upon whom service of any legal process or notice issuing out of any court or of the cor poration department may be made 4 The cash value of the assets of the corporation and the nature and character of such assets 5 The amount of indebtedness of the corporation and if such indebtedness is secured in what manner 6 A statement in detail of all bonds and mortgages issued by and outstanding against said corporation showing when said bonds were issued when the same become due and the consideration received by the corporation for said bonds in property or money and if in property the nature situation and cash value of such property and in case of mortgages a statement showing the date of such mortgages the date of their maturity the property covered thereby and the cash value thereof 7 The amount of shares of stock or bonds owned or con trolled by said corporation in any other corporation and the propor tion of the entire capital stock which such holding represents both in the reporting corporation and the corporation whose shares it holds 647 35The Annals of the American Academy 8 The amount of assets and liabilities of any corporation i which such reporting corporation holds stock or bonds giving the character of such assets and liabilities and of what such assets and liabilities consist 9 The number of shares of the capital stock of the cor poration which have been actually issued and the amount and value of the consideration actually received into the treasury of the cor poration for such shares where the payment was made in money then the amount in money per share where such payment was made in property a description of such property as to location character and the cash value thereof Io That it is not a party to any contract or agreement for the purpose of or which operates as a restraint of trade or com merce or which results in giving to either corporation a monopoly of trade in any article of common use or utility or which results in any business or commercial advantage over other corporations or persons engaged in like trade business or commerce by virtue of such agreement or contract That it is not a party to any pooling plan agreement or contract with any other corporation for any purpose which when carried into effect would create a monopoly of the trade or business in which such corporation or corporations is engaged or in any degree lessen or destroy competition between corporations or between corporations and natural persons engaged in business trade or commerce of a similar character II That no part of the capital stock of the corporation is owned controlled or voted by any other corporation or by the officers of any other corporation I2 That the corporation does not have or receive any rebate deduction discrimination drawback preference or advantage in rates of transportation or anything incident to such transportation from any common carrierrailroad pipe line water carriers or other transportation companyby which its products are or may be transported which give to it any advantage or profit directly or indirectly as against any other person or corporation who ships or desires to ship products of a similar character over such trans portation lines under like conditions or if any such have been received or given then such corporation shall state when from whom on what account and in what manner it was received mak ing a detailed exposition of the entire transaction 648 36Federal Control of Interstate Commerce I3 If a corporation is a railroad or transportation company or a common carrier of any kind that during the past year it has not granted to any person or persons corporation or company any special rates discriminations advantages or preferences whatsoever neitherhas it received any such That if at any time a corporation organized under the federal government shall fail to file its annual report as herein provided or shall fail to give the information required its officers should jointly and severally be personally liable to the United States in the sum of one thousand dollars per day for every day it transacts business and if any such report shall contain a false statement the officers making such false statement should be subject to a fine or imprisonment or both The object of compelling the making and filing of this annual report is to put on record under oath two of the officers of the cor poration in order that the department may have an additional hold on the responsible heads of the corporation for violation of law The annual examination hereinafter provided will enable the depart ment to verify the correctness of the report and thus ensure the truthfulness of the statements contained therein Seventh The commissioner or head of this bureau through his staff of examiners should examine annually into the affairs of all corporations chartered by his department inspecting their books agreements receipts expenditures vouchers records of meetings of directors and of stockholders and report the condition of their affairs as of the first of January of each year Power should be given to compel the attendance of witnesses to be examined under oath to call experts to testify as to values and to require the pro duction of all books papers contracts agreements and documents relating to any subject under investigation no matter in whose pos session or in what part of the United States or of its lependencies such documents may be The claim that any such testimony or evidence may tend to criminate the person giving such evidence or testimony should be met by a provision that any such evidence or testimony should not be used against such person on the trial of any criminal proceeding But no person so testifying should be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying And if it should be found that a corporation is over capitalized or is violating any antitrust or other law the commis 649 37The Annals of the American Academy sioner of the corporation bureau after giving to the corporation sixty days written notice to comply with the laws should place the evi dence in the hands of the AttorneyGeneral who should immediately commence an action to annul its charter The commissioner should also have the power to compel cor porations to furnish from time to time such statements in regard to the conduct of the corporate business the change of stock inter ests the financial condition of the company and such other data as may in his judgment be necessary to a complete understanding of the business and the condition of the corporation A detailed report of the examination of the property business profits and losses of every corporation chartered by this bureau should be made each year and kept on file in the office of the com missioner A summary statement of the corporate assets and liabil ities the amount of stock issued and the amount paid thereon in cash and otherwise the actual amount of surplus and the nature and mode in which it is used and invested should be published in a government paper designated for that purpose and in one news paper published in the county where the principal place of business of such corporation is located The publication of such facts would in no wise injure the corporation while the publication of a detailed report might paralyze or destroy the business done by corporations It is well known that a corporation just as a partnership or an in dividual in business in some years makes money in some loses money and in others comes out even but in the average comes out ahead If the creditors found at the end of a year that a corpora tion had lost money how long would it be before the credit of that corporation would be lost how long before the banks would refuse to renew or to discount its paper how long before the creditors would place their claims in judgment and force the corporation into a receivership or into bankruptcy Great care should be taken to protect amply the rights of privacy while at the same time care should be exercised to protect the public by giving out such facts as they as creditors stockholders and prospective investors are entitled to know The first concern of the government which grants charters of incorporation ought to be to see that its corporate offsprings are doing a legitimate business and are not violating any of the laws Its second concern ought to be the giving to the public of all such 650 38Federal Control of Interstate Commerce information as should affect the reasonable judgment of a man in determining whether he should or should not invest in a particular concern These obligations on the part of the government are universally recognized but the means to be employed to effect these ends are still a matter of keen discussion Experience has abundantly proved that it is not practicable to allow corporations to issue their own reports without the existence of a board of inspection to verify the truth of the statements con tained therein Such a plan of reporting without such inspection and verification has been tried by the various states and the result has been that the reports if not so meagre as to be of no practical value are of so complex a nature that the majority of persons are incapable of understanding or properly appreciating them As a matter of fact a government board of examiners is abso lutely indispensable for the realization of compulsory publicity With such a board the affairs of each corporation would become known and the purchaser of bonds and of stocks could rely upon the corporation bureau to see that corporations are not over capitalized and that they are doing business honestly and fairly and within the provisions of law In this way the corporation the purchaser of corporate bonds and of stocks and the general public will be protected If the socalled tobacco leather whiskey ice sugar steel and shipbuilding trusts had been subjected to the ordeal of a thorough investigation by expert accountants and their true finan cial condition laid before the public a large number of serious losses would have been prevented from falling upon innocent and worthy people The fact that industrials as well as railroad and transpor tation companies are possessed of double attributes of public and private nature combined opens the way to abuse of official power The favored few in the inner confidence of the managers have advantages in the general market to which they are not justly entitled The investigation of the refunding committee of the Pacific railroads at Washington brought out the evidence from one of the principal witnesses that the books connected with the construc tion of the road had been burned or destroyed as useless trash although they contained the record of transactions involving hun 651 39The Annals of the American Academy dreds of millions of dollars a record which became absolutely necessary to a fair settlement between the government and its debtors There was put in evidence the fact that a certain party in interest had testified before another committee that he was pres ent when 54oooooo of profits were divided equally among four partnershimself and three others None of the books of record containing this valuable information escaped the flames The investigation of various railroad corporations has shown that some of the managements have peculiar methods if not delin quencies in bookkeeping which if they had received rigid investi gation and the guilty parties had been held responsible for their acts many of the great railway corporations would not have been wrecked during the panic of I89395 Such annual inspection by a government board of examiners would prevent a repetition of these evils and would ensure the cor rectness of published reports and prospectuses and would prove a check on the discriminations which have built up and destroyed so many corporations Under the present industrial conditions Mr Garfield in his report says secrecy and dishonesty in promotion overcapitaliza tion unfair discrimination by means of transportation and other rebates unfair and predatory competition secrecy of corporate administration and misleading or dishonest financial statements are generally recognized as the principal evils These evils would in a large measure disappear if the corporate managers knew that the government by an annual inspection would bring to light all their acts The government which gives to a group of citizens a charter of incorporation a special privilege an advantage they did not possess as individuals has the right to know that the privilege is not being used unfairly and illegally If a corporation is legally organized and is conducting a legitimate business no injury will be done it by inspection Eighth A progressive graded tax should be levied on the actual net profits of corporations chartered by this department above 6 per cent Such tax might be graded as follows IIo of the ist per cent above 6 per cent 19 of the 21 per cent above 6 per cent 652 40Federal Control of Interstate Commerce I8 of the 3d per cent above 6 per cent I7 of the 4th per cent above 6 per cent I6 of the 5th per cent above 6 per cent I5 of the 6th per cent above 6 per cent I4 of the 7th per cent above 6 per cent I3 of the 8th per cent above 6 per cent I2 of the 9th per cent above 6 per cent 6IO of the Ioth per cent above 6 per cent 7Io of the IIth per cent above 6 per cent 8IO of the I2th per cent above 6 per cent 9IO of each per cent of profits above I8 per cent Each corporation is rated according to the profits made The corporate charter is valued exclusively by the prosperity of the cor poration A tax upon the profits would be governed by actual results and be equal in its effect upon different corporations and be just in its general operation Whether or not a corporation had a special privilege in the nature of a monopoly given by the patent laws by the tariff by a special franchise or by the control of the market would make no difference in the laying of the tax If a corporation possessed any of these privileges it would be obliged to pay for each in proportion to its value as evidenced by its earning power A corporation should be permitted to earn a reasonable profit on its assets If this permission were taken away all incen tive to carry on business would be killed the affairs of corporations would be wound up and the people would be compelled to face general disaster the like of which the world has never known That the percentage of profits allowed untaxed should be liberal in view of the risk taken by the investor no one would question While four per cent may be the average value of capital we would suggest the allowance untaxed of six per cent of actual net profits on the fair market value of the tangible assets of the corporation as this percentage would be large enough to stimulate business and not so large as to work injustice between corporations chartered by this bureau and corporations chartered by the various states It is reasonable to assume that corporations will make all the profits they dare and if we place a progressive graded tax upon their profits their incentive to overcharge and increase their profits beyond a fair amount will be taken away and their time thought 653 4IThe Annals of the American Academy and energy will be bestowed in bettering the quality of their pro ducts in extending their markets and in holding their place in the business world Franchises special privileges and tariff pro tection will not produce the valuable monopolies they are creating today for upon the adoption of this plan of taxation the monopolies will not be allowed to yield the large profits that are now enjoyed If a corporation has to pay as a tax 9Io of each per cent of profits above I8 per cent it will not risk the losing of its trade for the sake of making so small a percentage of profit and the people will get the benefit of a cheaper price and a better article Ninth In determining the actual net profits earned by a cor poration the board of examiners should annually ascertain the fair market value of the tangible assets of the corporation not taking into consideration the franchises the capital stock or its bonds This value may be obtained by an examination of theofficers of the corporation by inspection of its books and by expert testi mony The board should deduct from the total earnings of the corporation the necessary and reasonable expenses of its manage ment including the actual amounts spent in renewing the plant the cost of materials purchased and used and in order to avoid double taxation the taxes paid on its property to all municipalities Having obtained these amounts the board should by ordinary business methods figure the percentage of profits earned in relation to its cor porate assets Tenth The cost of running the corporation bureau should be met in two ways a By the incorporation tax b By charging the various corporations examined an amount sufficient to pay the salaries and the expenses of the corporate examiners The amount charged would only be about ten dollars a day for the time spent by the examiner in investigating the affairs of a corporation If the bureau was conducted on economical lines a surplus ought to be obtained from the organization tax to go into the general fund while the amount collected as a tax on profits could go to reduce the general expenses of the government Eleventh Finally the question may be asked whether the cor poration bureau or some commission or interstate court should be 654 42Federal Control of Interstate Commerce given power to review and order changes in rates and to investi gate and punish the giving of rebates by railroads The annual simultaneous inspection of railroads and of indus trial corporations proposed in the foregoing plan will discover whether railroads are giving rebates and whether they are dis criminating between shippers in the matter of freight rates The present laws on the statute books provide penalties of sufficient severity for the giving of rebates and for discriminations Their ineffectiveness is due very largely to the inability of the government to obtain the facts upon which a judgment for conviction can be obtained While the examination of the books of the common car riers alone might not secure the evidence required the simultaneous examination of the affairs of transportation companies and of ship ping corporations would undoubtedly bring to light all violations of the antirebate and discriminatory laws No additional legislation appears to be needed if this proposed inspection is adopted The railroads by governmental inspection being freed from the pressure compelling the giving of rebates will for the first time be enabled to compete with each other on equal terms Competi tion will then be free and the railroad giving the best service or charging the lowest freight rates will get the business The graded tax on profits above six per cent will take away the desire to obtain large temporary profits at the risk of losing traffic by competing roads extending their lines to enter into direct competition With profits taxed so heavily and competition being on terms of absolute equality the railroads would be compelled for their own protection to keep their rates reasonable and to give good service to the public If this plan of inspection and taxation did not furnish the relief contemplated the changed conditions resulting therefrom would undoubtedly suggest a remedy possibly not so drastic as the remedies suggested today Our democratic Amer ican government should not be permitted to step in and run the business of individuals by fixing the rates to be charged whether such business be in its nature private quasipublic or public except as a last resort for the protection of the people when all other feasi ble plans have failed to provide the proper checks and needful remedies 43

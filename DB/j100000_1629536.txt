Experiment Station secretary A C TRUE RECENT WORK ON MOLLUSKS THE land shell fauna of the Hawaiian Islands has been discussed by E R Sykes with intercalations on anatomy by Lieuten antColonel GodwinAusten Mr Sykes has worked upon museum material espe cially that collected by Perkins and the rich stores of the British Museum and the Bos ton Society of Natural History He finds the number of species much exaggerated as every one familiar with the group was well aware The fauna is considered to be Polynesian and to show hardly any trace of Asiatic or American influence Oahu is the center of distribution and the most populous in Achatinellidse The list given is a useful one but the monographic study of the Achatinellas from an evolutionary standpoint remains to be written A S Jensen of Copenhagen initiates what promises to be a series of Studier over Nordiske Mollusker by an investiga tion of the forms and distribution of the boreal Myast The paper is illustrated by some excellent

of this kind will have a permanent value M Maurice Cossmann continues his phe nomenal activity in the field of Tertiary mollusks by a paper which is to be followed by others on the  Mollusques ltoc6niques de la Loire Inf6rieure t An interesting series of forms is figured and it is curious to see how many of them recall parallel species from our own Claibornian horizon Mr W J Fox in a recent number 306 p 718 of this Journal refers to a shell named by Osbeck in his Reise nach ost Indien und China 1765 Cunnus chi nensis The objectionable generic name was doubtless derived from Linnaeus who used it in the manuscript of the Mu seum Ludovicae Ulricae for the shell now known as Venus dione It was not pub lished by Linnseus who substituted Venus in the tenth edition of the Systema Na turse and afterward in the Museum Cata logue referred to A very interesting ac count of the gradual evolution of the early Linnsean generic names and of the binomial system itself will be found in a paper by the late Professor Sven Lov6n On the species of Echinoidea described by Linnaeus in the K Svensk vet Akad Handl Bd 13 IV No 5 1887 pp 360 Luckily Os becks application of the name referred to seems

contends that the  stammform of one of the Baikal sponges Lubomirskia baicalensis is an inhabitant of Bering Sea Hoernes has regarded the fauna of the lake as anal ogous to that of the Sarmatic beds of South ern Europe but this analogy is hardly greater than it bears to various other late Tertiary lakebeds including those of our Great Basin In the September number of the Nachrichtsblatt der deutschen Malako zoologischen Gesellschaft Dybowski announces the discovery of a Nudibranch Ancylodoris baicalensis Dyb and the presence of nu merous Trochophora larvea in April in the lake These being strictly marine animals never before reported from fresh water the evidence as to the lakes origin seems con clusive and its character as a  relictensee positively established Mr Henry Hemphill has recently for warded to the National Museum a photo graph of a sixvalved specimen of Ischnochi ton obtained by him at San Diego California Sevenvalved specimens the normal num ber being eight are known to be preserved in the British Museum and the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia and now Mr E R Sykes figures in the Journal of Malacology VII p 164 a threevalved specimen of Ischnochiton contractus Reeve from South Australia The rarity of these abnormal individuals makes the discovery most interesting In another note Mr Sykes records the presence in the fauna of Natal of a species of the genus Cryptoplax previously supposed to be confined to the IndoPacific and Australian provinces Dr George W Taylor of Nanaimo has added a new genus to the fauna of the Pa cific coast in the shape of an undescribed species of Phyllaplysia P Taylori which was found near Nanaimo on floating sea weed The animal is of a clear lemonyel low about an inch in length and with a nearly smooth surface The genus has heretofore been known only from the coasts of France andsthe Adriatic Pelseneer has been pursuing researches on the various mollusks believed to exhibit archaic features He devotes attention chiefly to the Chitonacea the Docoglossa Rhipidoglossa and Solenoconcha His con clusions do not include any remarkable novelties but afford in many cases addi tional confirmation of opinions long held or occasionally expressed by macologists Thus he considers the metamerism of chi tons to be a secondary not primitive con dition recognizes the features of the Doco glossa limpets which are analogous to those of the Amphineura confirms the unlikeness of Scissurella to Pleurotomaria and the asym metry of the epipodial processes in the Trochidse Some interesting new facts are recorded among the Pyramidellidse Odos tomia was found to be hermaphrodite but otherwise related to ordinary Pectini branchs The Scaphopods he considers to have distinct relations with the Rhipido glossate gastropods but one of the charac ters the opening of the genital duct into the right nephridium has already been shown to be fallacious by H Fischer the error be ing due to the torsion in the embryo It is probable that this supposed relation will not be accepted by students of the group In regard to the nephridia of both Doco glossate and Rhipidoglossate limpets Pro fessor Pelseneer is at variance with Er langer but in another contested hypothesis the relation of the Placophora and Aplaco phora in which he differs from Thiele by regarding the groups as related we believe Pelseneer to be right At any rate whether all details be confirmed by future research or not the present paper contains much which will prove welcome to students of the Mollusks MXm Acad Roy des Sci de Belgique LVII 1899 Pp 113 SCIENCE 823N S VOL XII No 309 Professor L Cuenot Arch de Biologie XVI 1899 has published some interesting researches on the excretory organs and their functions in a variety of mollusks In these he shows how different portions of the nephridia excrete different effete ele ments of the fluids of the body and how these functions are distributed The mem oir has been crowned by the Royal Bel gian Academy An unusual condensation of embryonic stages has been observed in two nudi branchs Cenia cocklsi by Pelseneer and in Pelta coronata by Vayssiere These em bryos do not exhibit the usual embryonic velum and shell of other Opisthobranchs but the body at an early stage becomes cov ered with vibratile cilia and rotates in the fluids of the egg Zool Anz XXIII 1900 In the Proceedings of the Malacological So ciety IV No 3 October 1900 Mr M F Woodward gives some important informa tion in regard to the anatomy of three members of the Volutacea the significance of which is however somewhat obscured by the authors want of knowledge of the present state of the nomenclature The paper gives a general account of the mac roscopic anatomy of Neptuneopsis Gilchristi Sowerby a newly described and peculiar form from South Africa and of Voluta  an cilla and  olutilithes abyssicola Adams and Reeve Of the anatomy of the latter nothing was known The Neptuneopsis was described in a South African publication which has not reached this country and is gener ally inaccessible so it is to be regretted that Mr Woodward did not recapitulate the shell characters for the benefit of students The radula also had been abstracted from the specimen before it was received by him so that the chief aids to systematic classifi cation are wanting However it seems pretty certain from the characters of the nervous system that the animal is nearly related to the Volutidae and since it has an operculum probably to the true volutes which Mr Woodward calls Volutolyria a name which is an absolute synonym of Voluta L Lamarck Until more informa tion is received it would be rash to come to more precise conclusions as to its sys tematic place The only data in relation to the anatomy of Volutilithes properly speaking as far as one can judge from the shell the type being Voluta spinosa Lam a fossil spe cies were given by me in the Proc U S Nat Mus XII No 773 p 315 1889 from an examination of V Philippiana Dall from the South American coast To the data there supplied it may be added that the dentition consists of a single longitudi nal row of 50 tricuspid teeth the cusps be ing long thornlike and somewhat decurved It has no operculum and is blind This radula is most like that of Cymba olla L and Volutilithes doubtless belongs to the Scaphel lidee as does Cymbiola or Scaphella ancilla In 1890 I separated the group to which Volutilithes abyssicola belongs as a sub genus Volutocorbis as it obviously could not be classed with the original Volutilithes This course is now fully justified by the anatomical details supplied by Mr Wood ward the most remarkable of which is the radula which has two rows of unicuspid laterals one on each side of the rhachidian tricuspid tooth This radula is unlike any of the Volutacea yet known as Volutomitra which Woodward compares with it has like the others only a single row and Tros chel in his text explains how the deceptive appearance of laterals in one of his figures arises from the crushing of the base under a cover glass The single rhachidian of Volutomitra is well figured by Stimpson Bull U S Nat Mus No 37 pl xxxiv Fig 7 The radula of Volutocorbis is inter mediate between that of Vasum and that of Oliva The group will now take rank as a distinct genus If it remains in the Volu 824 SCIENCESCIENCE tacea it must be placed in the Scaphellidse The chief distinctive characters of this family beside the conditions of the larval shell and the absence of an operculum ap pear from Woodwards researches to be the extreme condensation of the chief gan glia around the gullet the development of a very large cesophageal csecum which led Poiret to suppose Halia had a double oesophagus and two pairs of preneural salivary glands If the family is divided into two subfamilies on the basis of the radula Volutomitrinae with a unicuspid median tooth will include Amoria Voluto mitra and Halia while Scaphellinae with a tricuspid tooth will include the others The typical Voluta and Lyria have wide rhachidian teeth with many cusps an oper culum shelly protoconch and other char acters which separate them entirely from the Scaphellidse According to our present knowledge one of the most important results of Mr Woodwards labors is to show that the old family of Volutidae included many di verse types and that a great deal remains to be done before we can proceed to gener alize with safety on those of which the ne pionic stages and anatomy are unknown WM H DALL RICHTER AND THE PERIODIC SYSTEM A VERY remarkable work appeared at the close of the last century This was Die Anfaxigsgriinde der St6chyometrie by J B Richter the first volume of which appeared in 1792 and the third and last volume in 1794 In this book we have the first definite statement of the law of pro portionality and some have thought that they have found in it also the Atomic Theory though it was not claimed that this theory was definitely stated Richters work attracted attention at the time because of his defense in it of the Read before N C Section Amer Chem Soo Nov 9 1900 825 phlogistic theory and it was vigorously at tacked by the supporters of the New Chem istrywho followed Lavoisier and the French chemists The deeper purport of the book and the new ideas advanced do not seem to have been well understood or to have been largely commented upon Fischer who in 1802 translated into German Berthdllets Statique Chimique was apparently the first to draw general attention to the work of Richter and to its bearing upon the con clusions drawn by Berthollet This latter chemist and Guyton de Morveau acknowl edged that Richter had anticipated them in the inference to be drawn from the per manence of neutrality after the decompo sition of certain neutral salts and the possibility of calculating beforehand the composition of the salts produced The discovery of the law of proportionality was a most important one and Richter must therefore be regarded as a very re markable man In his discovery that the amounts of different metals combining with a given weight of acid combine with a fixed amount of oxygen he went a step further anticipating the work of Gay Lus sac and when he established the fact that such metals as iron and mercury have the power of combining with oxygen in several proportions showing different degrees of oxidation he was several years ahead of Proust and verged upon the discovery of the law of multiple proportions With all his ability to see deeply into the workings of natural phenomena Richter was not a clear and logical thinker Wurtz rightly speaks of him as the profound but perplexed author of the great discovery of proportionality He was confused by his adherence to the illogical phlogistic theories which were becoming each year more un tenable He was further hampered by his determination to give a mathematical foun dation to the science of chemistry and to express all chemical changes by form uls NOVEMBER 30 1900

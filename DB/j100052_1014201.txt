j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1014201,Present Day Prices,i242678,Present Day Prices By HOWARD E FIGG Assistant AttorneyGeneral United States Department of Justice O UR greatest postwar problem is undeniably the high cost of living Its solution presents an even greater problem Before those of us who would attempt a solution is arrayed a complication of conditions appalling in their magnitude It is evident after a careful consideration of all of these conditions that time in this case as in many otherswill be the solvent of our national puzzle Only through gradual adjustment to the economic standards of former days can equilibrium be attained It is a concurrent opinion however that a safe and sane adjustment may be directed through a proper realiza tion of the significance of prevalent conditions Further than this no pre dictions can be forthcoming The outcome rests with the people them selves with their realization of respon sibility and their understanding of the influence of individual action upon the general surface of affairs Our first duty is to understand thoroughly the facts in the case The prices of things that enter into our daily lives are nearly twice as much as they were before the war In England they are three times as much and in Germany and Russia still higher This means that pending adjust ment to new conditions a great hard ship falls upon all of us Those of us who are dependent upon salaries have found to some extent a remedy in an increase of pay This increase on the other hand is immediately reflected in the cost of living We find ourselves therefore getting nowhere by such tac tics except to the point where industrial disaster stares us straight in the face We realize that we cannot indefinitely continue to raise both wages and living cost The time has arrived when we must stop the operation of such a vicious circle The plea now is to ask the patriotic people of America to halt in their desires to better their own conditions selfishly and to consider the interests of everyone to hold the line steady until the economic forces begin to operate production increases and the normal law of supply and demand becomes operative CAUSES FOR THE HIGH COST OF LIVING Getting at the root of the matter it is evident that the chief causes for the high cost of living are decreased production incident to the war in flated currency due to government borrowings and heavy taxes which are passed on by business men to the ultimate consumer SOLUTION OF THE HIGH COST OF LIVING Increased Production versus Decreased Consumption Working with these truths as a basis the solution of the problem then appears to simmer down to a very simple explanationproduce more or consume less The law of supply and demand is now and always will 18PRESENT DAY PRICES 19 be the sole cause and regulator of commercial value If production can not be increased rapidly enough to overtake the unprecedented demand then demand must be curtailed until supply has been given a chance The need for increased production is shown on every hand and in every line of business The Department of Justice has advocated from the very start the necessity for stimulation of produc tion Instead of shirking and slacken ing our efforts how vastly better it is for the country for the world and for our own individual selves to roll up our sleeves and tackle the proposition of restocking the world Recognizing this then our path lies straight before us Awaiting the realization of our aims however the question of control of prices presents itself for consideration and its answer seems a likely alleviation for besetting conditions PRICE CONTROL My own view is and I believe it can be substantiated from five years of food control all over the world that until shipping credits and production become normal there is no effective control of the cost of living that can be set up which is not based on an absolute control of prices and distri bution of the great underlying staple commodities By this I do not mean price fixing of those commodities but price stabil ization through provision for proper storage of surpluses in the flush season through control of exports imports foreign buying and conditions of credits to foreign nations in such man ner as to protect both consumer and farmer The control of the middle man and the elimination of speculation in such circumstances is not insuperable be cause the margins which should be charged by such trade in the steps of distribution can be determined and with a knowledge of the basic price their conduct can be constantly checked in the public markets by a mere price inquiry and advertisement to the public This basic system was of course destroyed when the govern ment took down the export control and dissolved the Food Administration The removal of these safeguards and the vast world speculation in anticipa tion of the removal of the blockade against central Europe has produced a sickening rise in prices and a lot of profiteering This is of two sorts First vicious speculation for rise in price and second the tendency of the whole world to protective buying Our weapon against this state of affairs is the enforcement of the Lever Act by the Department of Justice In the middle of August the depart ment inaugurated a campaign to discover and prosecute violators of the Food Control Act Section 6 of the act provided a penalty for hoard ing and Section 7 authorized the seiz ure and sale of hoarded necessities Eleven hundred and seventysix pros ecutions have been instituted under all sections In all sentences have been imposed in 107 cases The sentences have ranged from five months in jail and 5000 fine to small fines The educational and constructive organization of the Department of Justice which now operates in the direction of controlling prices is the High Cost of Living Division Its20 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY field organization is comprised of state fair price commissioners who have authority to appoint such com mittees in cities towns or counties to determine upon fair prices or fair margins of profit to be allowed on the necessaries of life The fixing of these prices or margins is not arbitrarily done but only after full consideration of business interests and their active co6peration is encour aged by the fair price commissioner at all times Where possible the different business and trade interests in a community are represented on those fair price committees No one element alone will reduce the present high prices but by a full cotiperation of all elements and by constructive policies being determined upon by the different interests and put into effect by the Department of Justice through its duly organized agents there is reason to believe that we may anticipate material reductions on certain of the necessaries of life in reasonable time Our government or any agency of the government cannot singly accom plish the desired results but by a complete cotiperation of the public labor and business interests we may anticipate an early reduction in prices There should be an organization of fair price committees in every city and county backed by the mayors and prosecuting attorneys with the support of the United States attorneys ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES Supplementing these definite activi ties the department is attempting to bring home to individuals a proper understanding of the economic situa tion prevailing in the country Recog nizing the value of concerted action on the part of all the department is endeavoring to set the situation frankly before the people The Price Level The first thing we believe that people need to do to approach such under standing is to adjust themselves to the price level approximately double the prewar basis with no tendency to fall and considering only our prewar debt which would be doubled in com modities and labor if prices fell to pre war level the hardship of prewar creditors must be forgotten UnderPaid and OverPaid Labor Secondly people must cooiperate in establishing a wage scale commen surate with the cost of decent living conditions If there is to be content ment in the nation labor must be neither underpaid nor overpaid In certain industries now wages are much higher than the standard necessary to meet fair living expense and in these industries they will have to come down to a reasonable level Where labor is much overpaid the commodity which it produces will be priced exor bitantly to the buying public Where it is underpaid it will be a source of weakness to the nation Necessity for Increased Production Thirdly people must be educated into the confident knowledge that with a price level insured against falling we may and must increase our rate of production in order to raise our scale of living For even with the equi table division of the joint products of our labor that will naturally come under a condition of full employmentPRESENT DAY PRICES 21 we cannot escape the fact that the sum total of our products is all that can be divided If we produce much we will divide much if we produce little we will divide little and live poorly Stable Average Prices Lastly we must consider very care fully and treat more drastically than ever the conspiracies that seek to control the price of any products or of the labor that enters into its pro duction The absolute assurance of stable average price which is now set up for years to come makes possible the full employment of all our peoples all the time they wish to work and an equitable distribution of the fruits of our efforts can only be assured by full and free competition in every depart ment of activity The exercise of individual initiative must be encouraged and monopoly in every form must be prohibited When and wherever an activity is necessarily monopolistic as in public utilities they must be publicly owned and operated Wise statesmanship will take this view and wise citizenship will sustain it A period of human progress is at hand and the sooner we adjust ourselves to it the better Our recognition of the right of labor to live better than it has ever lived before and our determination to con tinue our economic condition in which the demand for labor will always equal or exceed the supply will emancipate labor the world over and eliminate the wellmeant but illadvised efforts of organized labor physically to fight or coerce its way to justice We should appreciate the efforts of employes as well as employers to organize for the purpose of studying the great questions that concern them for a lack of knowledge is at the bottom of all our trouble But we live as a nation as a nation we will suffer if they are allowed physically to fight or angrily to intrigue for supremacy or to monopolize their products and profiteer at the expense of the country The Great Seal of the United States bears a prophecy that is now to be fulfilled Annuit coeptis nuvus ordo seclorum The things accomplished promise a new order for the ages A new era is at hand in which intelligent and honest investigation and the application of the Golden Rule to human disputes shall take the place of force and intrigue and to this nation the world is looking for the initiative

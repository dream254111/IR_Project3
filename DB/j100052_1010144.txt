GermanyThe Annual Report on German Colonies and Protecto rates which has just appeared indicates a total native population in these districts exclusive of Kiaouchou of about ro700000 with Europeans to the number of about 8ooo From the returns on the economic conditions of the colonies it is apparent that in spite of the extensive construction of railways bridges roads etc which has been planned or is in course of execution the colonies are only in the earliest stage of development With that thoroughness which is char acteristic of the German the Imperial Government has established experimental agricultural stations in every colony The natural pro duce of the country is studied with a view to its thorough commercial development Fruits nuts fibrous plants etc from other parts of the world are also being introduced and special efforts are made to establish and develop rubber coffee and tobacco plantations The German enterprises in Africa are subject to all the peculiar advan tages and disadvantages of the German governmental system The Beamtentum with its selfsacrificing and welldisciplined yet arbi trary and semimilitary characteristics has been established throughout the colonies If conscientious painstaking effort can create a colonial system worth having the Germans are in a fair way to succeed and in the future when the competition of nations shall be turned more directly toward the Continent of Africa Germany will doubtless be found to have laid the foundations of a great colonial empire At the present time however the German colonies are almost devoid of German population Emigration from the Fatherland is flowing in more attractive channels where it seems only to strengthen other nations than Germany The German settlements in AsiaMinor Mexico and South America are rapidly forming the basis of what might well become an important colonial system were it possible for the German political power to be extended over these territories One cannot learn of the painstaking efforts expended in Africa without wishing that a more favorable field might be opened to a people so admirably equipped for colonization PhilippinesThe Division of Insular Affairs of the War Depart ment has recently compiled the most important information dealing with the peoples of the Philippines The material is taken from various sources and is highly interesting The islands seem to have been sub ject to successive waves of immigration from the mainland each wave leaving a different racial stratum according to the origin of the immigrants Over all the islands may be found what is sup 558COLONIES AND COLONIAL GOVERNMENT posed to be the aboriginal race or Negritos They represent a very low type of development The most highly developed of the native races are the Tagals and Visayans both of which have been domes ticated or semicivilized under Spanish influence The Chinese form a very important element in the foreign population Their economic instincts are most acute and they have accordingly amassed immense wealth in a country where the natives live from hand to mouth As a consequence of this prosperity the Chinese have always been unpopular and numerous wholesale massacres of the Chinese are reported A curious element in the native population is the race known as the Moros who are supposed to have descended from the Mussul men of Borneo From that island they brought their religion and customs notably slavery and polygamy They have for centuries controlled the Zulu Islands and large portions of the Island of Min danoa Numerous attempts had been made by the Spanish to subdue the Moros and to convert them to Christianity but without success The number of Europeans in the Philippines is comparatively small The Spaniards have never settled in the islands to any great extent Up to the time of the American occupation there were a few English and Germans The imports into the islands for the eight months ending August I900 were i4580457 as compared with 12270I63 for a similar period in I899 exports for the eight months ending August I9oo I5928o05 as compared with I10391286 for a similar period in I899 Of the imports I340717 came from the United States of the exports I95453I went to the United States England still has the largest trade of any individual country with the Philippines the totals amounting to more than double the figures for the United States both in imports and exports CubaThe Constitutional Convention has avoided any final deci sion in the acceptance or rejection of the Platt Amendment A com mission of five members appointed to confer with the President of the United States in reference to the relations of the two countries has visited Washington and conferred with the Administration as well as the committeemen of both houses of Congress The radical element in the convention is still in control but is beginning to split up into factions The commerce of Cuba still shows a healthy increase in volume Owing to a misunderstanding by certain press correspondents of the information communicated by the Division of Insular Affairs of the War Department the impression is spread abroad that Cuban com merce is declining This is only true of the imports and exports of 559 I63164 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY gold and silver not of merchandise Following is a statement of the figures for merchandise furnished by the division for the first nine months of I899 and I9oo respectively IMPORTS FROM ALL COUNTRIES 1899        46833I22 1900                   4970I998 An increase of six per cent in favor of I900 EXPORTS TO ALL COUNTRIES 1899  38572I46 I900  38020038 The principal item of decrease in the export column occurs in the trade with Spain EXPORTS TO SPAIN For nine months ending September I899   2788078 For nine months ending September I900   770456 The Cuban trade with the United States seems to be slowly increas ing Eliminating the coin shipments the imports from the United States to Cuba have gained 2986II for the first nine months of 1900 over a similar period in I899 The exports from Cuba to the United States have decreased 6835750 This is to be accounted for by the fact that a greater part of tobacco shipped by Europe is sent via New York In the returns of 1899 no distinction was made with reference to the destination of the commodity whereas in the returns of 1900 a large portion of this amount has been set down to European accolnt The CanadianAmerican syndicate recently formed for the purpose of developing the transportation facilities of Cuba has secured nearly all the property and rights necessary for a road running the entire length of the island Owing to the socalled Foraker law which prohibited the granting of franchises in Cuba by the American government it has been necessary for the company to purchase out right several long strips of territory Ship Subsidies for Colonial RoutesSince the first of the year two interesting experiments have been made by England and Ger many respectively in the furtherance of their colonial interests Germany has subsidized an important line of steamships plying between Hamburg and her African possessions The subsidy will enable ships to leave Hamburg every two weeks one vessel passing through the Mediterranean and around Africa the other passing down the west coast of Africa and up through the Red Sea returning by the Mediterranean The steamers are to be built in Germany and German trade is to have preference over that of foreign countries in 56oCOLONIES AND COLONIAL GOVERNMENT I65 making up the cargoes Employees and agents of the company are to be German subjects It is expected that by giving a more frequent service and perhaps lower freights the conditions of trade with the African colonies will be rendered more favorable The new English subsidy is intended to alleviate the depressed eco nomic conditions of the West Indies particularly of Jamaica Owing to the increasing competition of beet sugar with the West Indian cane sugar the British West Indies have been steadily sinking in impor tance Political discontent has also developed and in I899 an acute crisis arose in the Jamaican Legislative Council the elected members refusing to vote the budget on account of the poverty of the country The home authorities understanding that the political troubles are of economic origin have determined to extend the market for Jamaican and West Indian fruits It is thought that the new shipsubsidy will enable West Indian planters to dispose of their products in the English market A contract has therefore been made with a prominent ship ping firm for regular sailings between Bristol and West Indian ports the expense of the subsidy to be borne partly by the imperial and partly by the colonial governments

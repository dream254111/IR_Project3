states of the Union show greater diversity than in their primary election laws These laws in some cases are made applicable to particular cities or counties only in others to the entire state The operation of several of them is dependent upon acceptance by party committees or by the electors in local administrative divisions while the greater number are mandatory Moreover they differ in content no less than in the range of their application In a number of states they simply impose penalties for corrupt practices leaving to the party the development of a nominating system In others these negative provisions are supplemented by posi tive rules to govern the procedure at primary elections Finally four states have removed the primary from the jurisdiction of the party committee and placed it under the authority of a Board of Election Commissioners or some similar body In view of the general tendency toward uniform legislation such diversity in the treatment of the nominating problem may well excite surprise It is evident however from the history of primary legis lation that this lack of uniformity is a result not of diverse tendencies but of the unequal progress which different states have made in a common course of development The more primitive types of legislation which now prevail in a majority of the states correspond to the early stages in the evolution of the more advanced systems This will become apparent as we trace the course of development in Ohio and New Yorkthe states in which the movement has been carried farthestand then take a general survey of existing legislation In Ohio the first primary election law passed in I87I seems to have been designed to strengthen rather than to supersede the authority of the party committee It offered 346TENDZNCIES IN PRIMARY LEGISIATION to political parties but did not require them to accept the privilege of conducting primary elections under a system of rules prescribed and enforceable by law As this act or rather the earlier California act of which it is a literal copy has served as a model for subsequent legislation in several other states an outline of its essential provisions will be of interest I Elections of voluntary political associations may be called by a published notice which shall state I The purpose time manner and conditions 2 The authority by which the call is issued 3 The name of a legal voter to act as supervisor of the election 4 The qualifications of voters which must not be incon sistent with those expressed in the act II The supervisor must take an oath to the effect that he is a legal voter of the district and will faithfully conduct the election and can vass and report the votes cast as required by the authority calling the election He shall cause the qualified electors present to choose two judges and two clerks and administer to each of them the same oath taken by himself III Any qualified elector may challenge a voter on the ground I That he is not entitled to vote under the terms of the call 2 That he is not a citizen of the United States and a quali fied elector of the district 3 That he has received or been promised a bribe 4 That he has previously voted on the same day The supervisor or one of the judges must interrogate the challenged voter under oath If he refuse to answer his vote must be rejected but if he answer the questions satisfactorily and be not successfully contradicted by the sworn testimony of others it must be accepted IV Violation of the act by the  supervisor or judges as also fraud or bribery committed by electors are made misdemeanors V The act is applicable only when the published notice so states  In I886 an amendment t was added enabling party com mittees in Cincinnati to proceed a step further towards the legalization of the nominating system It provided that in  Act of February 24 I87I Vide Table of Laws seq tAct of May 17 I886 347 5758 ANNAIS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY cities of the first grade of the first class primary elections when advertised as required by law should be conducted at public expense in accordance with the election code by the judges and clerks of election belonging to the respec tive political parties Two years later  this provision slightly modified was extended to Cleveland Columbus Toledo and Dayton And again in 1898 came another spe cial act t applicable to Cincinnati which places the prima ries permanently under the authority of the Board of Elections By a quite different process New York has developed a similar system Primary legislation in the Empire State began in I866 X with a short paragraph making bribery or menace a misdemeanor The next act  prescribed penal ties for various kinds of fraud and also a number of positive rules to be observed at primary elections Originally limited in application to the counties in which Brooklyn and Buffalo are situated it was subsequently applied to the entire state 11 In 1887 the primaries in cities of over Ioooo inhabitants were placed under a quite elaborate system of positive rulesT which five years later were extended to cities of 5 ooo And finally in 1898 the duty of conducting primary elections in cities having a popula tion of over 50000 was made a state functionttt In the foregoing sketch we see I That acts originally applicable only to the principal cities are subsequently extended to larger areas and 2 that successive enactments for the same territory show a progressive subjection of the primaries to public authority  Act of April I6 I888 t Act of April 25 1898 This

attention to the most advanced enactments in each the early stages of a similar development may be seen As a rule the first act is characterized by the effort to avoid impairing the authority of the party over its own affairs The provisions are either purely negativepenalties for corrupt prac tices etcas was the case in New York or like the first Ohio law valid only after acceptance by the party authorities Of the states which may be said to have taken but the first step in primary legislation Colorado Connec ticut t Iowa Indiana  Louisiana 11 North Dakota 1 and Texas  have adopted the former course while Arkansas t California t Florida Kansas i1i1 and West Virignia I have taken the latter The legislatures of eighteen states have advanced a step further passing mandatory acts which not only prohibit corrupt practices but prescribe in greater or less detail the procedure to be observed at primary elections Though classed together as embodying the same principle these acts present a striking variety of detail In eight states the provisions are so meagre as to leave the authority of the party committee practically unrestricted In Michigan ttt Minne sota If Oregon  and Washington

procedure while acts in force in Ken tucky  Mississippi t and the cities of Boston t Milwaukee  Richmond 1I and Wilmington1 make provision for nearly all details In a number of these acts we see a tendency to place the primary on a legal equality with the regular election Thus in Kentucky and Washington tt and in the cities of Boston t Richmond Milwaukee lll and Wilming tonT the use of a blanket ballot is required In the city of Richmond the judges and clerks have the same rights powers and privileges and are subject to the same penalties as election officers While in Kentucky ttt Mississippi tt and in the city of Boston  primary elec tions must in all points not otherwise provided for be con ducted according to the election law Still more significant of the trend of

booths are erected and ballot boxes provided at public expense The registering officers are required in Wilmingtont Del to provide special voting books for primary elections and in Kentucky  to register the party affiliation of voters In Boston official primary ballots are printed by the Election Commissioners who are further authorized to preserve the ballots used at the primary and in case of a contest transmit them to the Registrars of Voters for an official count Finally under the Virginia act II applicable to Richmond the primary officers are appointed by the county judge from lists submitted by the candidates and in the city of Wil mingtonl they together with an official known as the Qualifier of Primary Election Officers are paid for their services at public expense The principle of which a partial application appears in the foregoing acts has been logically carried out in Mis souri and Illinois as well as in Ohio and New York by acts transferring practically the entire management of primary elections to public authority This step was first taken in Missouri An act of April 18 I89I applicable to St Louis directs the Recorder of Voters to fix the time for holding primaries divide each ward into primary districts designate polling places pre pare official primary ballots appoint judges and clerks from lists submitted by the candidates provide the necessary election paraphernalia and issue certificates of election to the persons receiving the highest number of votes The expenses are paid from the proceeds of an assessment levied upon all

act its application was extended to Kansas City and in I897 a new but similar law t was enacted for St Louis Aside from the general principle which it embodies the chief points to be noted in the primary legislation of Mis souri are i No rule is provided to distinguish the mem bers of different parties 2 the provisions are in the main general leaving to the Recorder of Voters a wide field of discretion The Illinois law likewise fails to prescribe a test of party membership but in definite provision for matters of detail it marks a long step in advance For the most part the primary is conducted exactly as a regular election A few preliminary matters are left to the discretion of the party authorities Thus the committee is permitted within limits prescribed by the law to name a day for the primary apportion the territory into primary districts locate polling places and also to select from the judges and clerks of the election precincts within the district three judges and two clerks to serve at the primary But having performed these functions its part is done Thereafter the primary is subject to the authority of the Board of Election Com missioners and with the exception of official ballots it is conducted with the same formalities as a general election I1 The act  in force in Cincinnati Ohio shows a still more complete application of the electoral system to the prima ries It establishes a general primary election for all par ties subject to all the provisions of the election law except that separate ballot boxes and separate official ballots are provided for each organization participating To general features similar to those of the Cincinnati act Act of April 19 I893 t Act of March 5 I897 t Act of February zo x898 I Ibid 5  Ibid  8  Act of April 25 I898 Vide note p 58 supra 352TENDENCIES IN PRIMARY LEGISLATION the New York law  adds a party enrollment and a definite test of party membership The system of party enrollment is a modified form of a plan devised in Kentucky t When a voter presents himself for registration the inspectors after recording his name and address as heretofore ask the question Do you desire to enroll for the purpose of par ticipating in the primary elections of any party If he answer in the negative or decline to answer the word No is written in the appropriate column but if the answer be affirmative the word Yes is written in the same place and the further question asked With what political party do you wish to enroll If not challenged the voter is entitled to enrollment in the party he desig nates But if challenged he must make a declaration cov ering three points i That he is in general sympathy with the principles of the party 2 that he intends to support its candidates generally at the ensuing election and 3 that he has not enrolled with or voted at the primary elec tions or conventions of any other party since the first day of last year t In consequence of the last declaration the voter who de sires to change his party affiliation at the regular time of registration in October must have passed a year and nine months without claiming membership in any party At a supplemental enrollment  held in the following May the period of probation is five months shorter only sixteen months having at that time elapsed since the first day of the preceding year The rolls thus made up in October and sup plemented in May are used in even years at a primary held on the first Tuesday in June to elect delegates to the state conventions and annually at the September primaries 1I Under the

primary district consists of two election precincts and therefore includes two polling places At one the inspec tors and clerks belonging to the party which polled the largest vote at the last election conduct a primary for the exclusive benefit of their own organization while at the other a general primary for all remaining parties is con ducted by the minority inspectors and clerks The inspec tors at both polling places have copies of the registration books containing the party enrollment and affiliation with each organization is restricted to persons enrolled with it But the vote of a duly enrolled elector still a resident of the district cannot on any ground be refused One of the most interesting features of this act is the method of voting which insures secrecy without an official ballot The ballots of different parties are distinguishable by color but those intended for the same party are of identical color weight and texture and therefore when folded cannot be distinguished from one another All candidates so desiring deposit their ballots with the election officers When a voter presents himself and is found duly enrolled he is given one ballot from each lot deposited for the use of his party and retires to a booth Returning with all the ballots folded he delivers to an inspector the one he intends to cast and then waiting till it is in the ballot box returns all the others which are placed in another box and after ward burned without examination As no one can tell by observation which of the ballots given the elector was placed in the ballot box secrecy is secured t The other features of the act are for the most part similar to analogous provisions of the election law The foregoing sketch indicates the salient features of the primary legislation in force at the close of I898 Amid all  Act of March 29 I898 Paragraphs 5 6 and 7 t Ibid Paragraph 7 Subdivision i 354TZNDENCIES IN PRIMARY LEGISLATION the variety of detail we see little more than the application of methods in vogue at the regular election Problems which because peculiar to the primary are incapable of solution through forms borrowed from the electoral sys tem have usually been neglected The most conspicuous instance is the qualification for voting at primary elections On this point most acts are very indefinite Several states merely restrict participation to legal electors  others to legal electors possessing such additional qualifications as the party committee may prescribe t while Illinois Maine Michiganll Mis souri St Louis and Ohio Cincinnati 1 add such vague and meaningess provisions as none but members of the party or only persons who have before affiliated with the party shall be permitted to vote What shall be the test of party membership only three or four states seriously attempt to determine Under the Wisconsin act all who supported the party ticket at the last election are eligible to vote at the primary The principal test prescribed by the New York law though different in form is similar in effect The voter declares when applying for party enrollment that he intends to support the ticket generally at next elec tion tt But as the roll then made up is not used at a primary until several months later by which time the next elec tion to which declaration referred has become the last election the condition is really the same as in Wisconsin Under the Montana laws a challenged voter is offered the alternative of swearing that he has been in the past identi fied with the party or that he intends to act with it at the

preclude independent voting on election day A recent California lawt which has been declared invalid by the State Supreme Court t effected an interesting compromise between the claims of the strict par tisan and the independent The act of voting was legally con strued as the declaration of a bonafide present intention to support the party ticket at the ensuing election Such a present intention might of course be honorably changed after the nominations had been made It is not surprising that State legislatures have avoided the problem of defining party membership Simple as it may appear it is hardly capable of a satisfactory solution While for obvious reasons those who do not intend to sup port the candidates of a party should be excluded from its primary it is impossible to enforce such a restriction with out denying the citizen that freedom of choice on election day which our political system contemplates If we require the voter to promise in advance to support the nominees of the party in whose primary he participates we obviously either prevent independent voting or deprive independent voters of all influence over party nominations Similarly when affiliation with the party at the last election is made the test the voter is tempted to support unfit candidates in order to maintain his party standing On the other hand if we would freely permit independent voting we must allow citizens to vote at a primary without assuming any obligation to abide by its action The interests of the pri mary and of the regular election being thus in conflict some compromise must be adopted Just what compromise will prevail it would be idle to predict Primary legislation has not yet attempted to do more than guarantee the honest casting and counting of votes There  Act of April

and corruption may nevertheless totally fail to reflect the sentiment of the majority The method of selecting candidatesa matter of no less importancehas usually been disregarded In some states the previously existing system is legally recog nized but as a rule the whole matter is left to the discretion of the party committee Throughout the southern states the general practice is to nominate by direct popular vote while in the north and west the convention plan prevails If the analogy of the regular election should continue to guide legislatures we may expect to see the direct vote made mandatory But it is highly improbable that such a system would prove a final solution of the nominating problem The direct vote though possibly well adapted to the conditions of some southern states where a relatively small upper class still maintains political leadership leaving to the rank and file of citizens only a yea or nay is radically illsuited to the more democratic conditions of the north especially of the great cities Its adoption would mark the formal abandonment of majority rule A majority election by a heterogeneous body without natural leaders is rarely possible except after deliberation and a number of ballots and even though we concede that the newspapers furnish a medium for ample discussion it will hardly be contended that it would be practicable to hold successive primary elections until one candidate should receive a majority of the votes Some form of indirect nomination appears therefore to be a necessity Is it not possible to devise a system which will insure the election of a truly representa tive convention Upon this problem primary reformers should concentrate their efforts WAITER J BRANSON Philadelphia Pa 67

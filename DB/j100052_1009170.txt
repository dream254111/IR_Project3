STATES OF THE UNION SHOW GREATER DIVERSITY THAN IN THEIR PRIMARY ELECTION LAWS THESE LAWS IN SOME CASES ARE MADE APPLICABLE TO PARTICULAR CITIES OR COUNTIES ONLY IN OTHERS TO THE ENTIRE STATE THE OPERATION OF SEVERAL OF THEM IS DEPENDENT UPON ACCEPTANCE BY PARTY COMMITTEES OR BY THE ELECTORS IN LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS WHILE THE GREATER NUMBER ARE MANDATORY MOREOVER THEY DIFFER IN CONTENT NO LESS THAN IN THE RANGE OF THEIR APPLICATION IN A NUMBER OF STATES THEY SIMPLY IMPOSE PENALTIES FOR CORRUPT PRACTICES LEAVING TO THE PARTY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOMINATING SYSTEM IN OTHERS THESE NEGATIVE PROVISIONS ARE SUPPLEMENTED BY POSI TIVE RULES TO GOVERN THE PROCEDURE AT PRIMARY ELECTIONS FINALLY FOUR STATES HAVE REMOVED THE PRIMARY FROM THE JURISDICTION OF THE PARTY COMMITTEE AND PLACED IT UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF A BOARD OF ELECTION COMMISSIONERS OR SOME SIMILAR BODY IN VIEW OF THE GENERAL TENDENCY TOWARD UNIFORM LEGISLATION SUCH DIVERSITY IN THE TREATMENT OF THE NOMINATING PROBLEM MAY WELL EXCITE SURPRISE IT IS EVIDENT HOWEVER FROM THE HISTORY OF PRIMARY LEGIS LATION THAT THIS LACK OF UNIFORMITY IS A RESULT NOT OF DIVERSE TENDENCIES BUT OF THE UNEQUAL PROGRESS WHICH DIFFERENT STATES HAVE MADE IN A COMMON COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT THE MORE PRIMITIVE TYPES OF LEGISLATION WHICH NOW PREVAIL IN A MAJORITY OF THE STATES CORRESPOND TO THE EARLY STAGES IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE MORE ADVANCED SYSTEMS THIS WILL BECOME APPARENT AS WE TRACE THE COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT IN OHIO AND NEW YORKTHE STATES IN WHICH THE MOVEMENT HAS BEEN CARRIED FARTHESTAND THEN TAKE A GENERAL SURVEY OF EXISTING LEGISLATION IN OHIO THE FIRST PRIMARY ELECTION LAW PASSED IN I87I SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN RATHER THAN TO SUPERSEDE THE AUTHORITY OF THE PARTY COMMITTEE IT OFFERED 346TENDZNCIES IN PRIMARY LEGISIATION TO POLITICAL PARTIES BUT DID NOT REQUIRE THEM TO ACCEPT THE PRIVILEGE OF CONDUCTING PRIMARY ELECTIONS UNDER A SYSTEM OF RULES PRESCRIBED AND ENFORCEABLE BY LAW AS THIS ACT OR RATHER THE EARLIER CALIFORNIA ACT OF WHICH IT IS A LITERAL COPY HAS SERVED AS A MODEL FOR SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION IN SEVERAL OTHER STATES AN OUTLINE OF ITS ESSENTIAL PROVISIONS WILL BE OF INTEREST I ELECTIONS OF VOLUNTARY POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS MAY BE CALLED BY A PUBLISHED NOTICE WHICH SHALL STATE I THE PURPOSE TIME MANNER AND CONDITIONS 2 THE AUTHORITY BY WHICH THE CALL IS ISSUED 3 THE NAME OF A LEGAL VOTER TO ACT AS SUPERVISOR OF THE ELECTION 4 THE QUALIFICATIONS OF VOTERS WHICH MUST NOT BE INCON SISTENT WITH THOSE EXPRESSED IN THE ACT II THE SUPERVISOR MUST TAKE AN OATH TO THE EFFECT THAT HE IS A LEGAL VOTER OF THE DISTRICT AND WILL FAITHFULLY CONDUCT THE ELECTION AND CAN VASS AND REPORT THE VOTES CAST AS REQUIRED BY THE AUTHORITY CALLING THE ELECTION HE SHALL CAUSE THE QUALIFIED ELECTORS PRESENT TO CHOOSE TWO JUDGES AND TWO CLERKS AND ADMINISTER TO EACH OF THEM THE SAME OATH TAKEN BY HIMSELF III ANY QUALIFIED ELECTOR MAY CHALLENGE A VOTER ON THE GROUND I THAT HE IS NOT ENTITLED TO VOTE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CALL 2 THAT HE IS NOT A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES AND A QUALI FIED ELECTOR OF THE DISTRICT 3 THAT HE HAS RECEIVED OR BEEN PROMISED A BRIBE 4 THAT HE HAS PREVIOUSLY VOTED ON THE SAME DAY THE SUPERVISOR OR ONE OF THE JUDGES MUST INTERROGATE THE CHALLENGED VOTER UNDER OATH IF HE REFUSE TO ANSWER HIS VOTE MUST BE REJECTED BUT IF HE ANSWER THE QUESTIONS SATISFACTORILY AND BE NOT SUCCESSFULLY CONTRADICTED BY THE SWORN TESTIMONY OF OTHERS IT MUST BE ACCEPTED IV VIOLATION OF THE ACT BY THE  SUPERVISOR OR JUDGES AS ALSO FRAUD OR BRIBERY COMMITTED BY ELECTORS ARE MADE MISDEMEANORS V THE ACT IS APPLICABLE ONLY WHEN THE PUBLISHED NOTICE SO STATES  IN I886 AN AMENDMENT T WAS ADDED ENABLING PARTY COM MITTEES IN CINCINNATI TO PROCEED A STEP FURTHER

TICIPATING IN THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS OF ANY PARTY IF HE ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE OR DECLINE TO ANSWER THE WORD NO IS WRITTEN IN THE APPROPRIATE COLUMN BUT IF THE ANSWER BE AFFIRMATIVE THE WORD YES IS WRITTEN IN THE SAME PLACE AND THE FURTHER QUESTION ASKED WITH WHAT POLITICAL PARTY DO YOU WISH TO ENROLL IF NOT CHALLENGED THE VOTER IS ENTITLED TO ENROLLMENT IN THE PARTY HE DESIG NATES BUT IF CHALLENGED HE MUST MAKE A DECLARATION COV ERING THREE POINTS I THAT HE IS IN GENERAL SYMPATHY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PARTY 2 THAT HE INTENDS TO SUPPORT ITS CANDIDATES GENERALLY AT THE ENSUING

INSPEC TORS AT BOTH POLLING PLACES HAVE COPIES OF THE REGISTRATION BOOKS CONTAINING THE PARTY ENROLLMENT AND AFFILIATION WITH EACH ORGANIZATION IS RESTRICTED TO PERSONS ENROLLED WITH IT BUT THE VOTE OF A DULY ENROLLED ELECTOR STILL A RESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT CANNOT ON ANY GROUND BE REFUSED ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING FEATURES OF THIS ACT IS THE METHOD OF VOTING WHICH INSURES SECRECY WITHOUT AN OFFICIAL BALLOT THE BALLOTS OF DIFFERENT PARTIES ARE DISTINGUISHABLE BY COLOR BUT THOSE INTENDED FOR THE SAME PARTY ARE OF IDENTICAL COLOR WEIGHT AND TEXTURE AND THEREFORE WHEN FOLDED CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER ALL CANDIDATES SO DESIRING DEPOSIT THEIR BALLOTS WITH THE ELECTION OFFICERS WHEN A VOTER PRESENTS HIMSELF AND IS FOUND DULY ENROLLED HE IS GIVEN ONE BALLOT FROM EACH LOT DEPOSITED FOR THE USE OF HIS PARTY AND RETIRES TO A BOOTH RETURNING WITH ALL THE BALLOTS FOLDED HE DELIVERS TO AN INSPECTOR THE ONE HE INTENDS TO CAST AND THEN WAITING TILL IT IS IN THE BALLOT BOX RETURNS ALL THE OTHERS WHICH ARE PLACED IN ANOTHER BOX AND AFTER WARD BURNED WITHOUT EXAMINATION AS NO ONE CAN TELL BY OBSERVATION WHICH OF THE BALLOTS GIVEN THE ELECTOR WAS PLACED IN THE BALLOT BOX

PRECLUDE INDEPENDENT VOTING ON ELECTION DAY A RECENT CALIFORNIA LAWT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED INVALID BY THE STATE SUPREME COURT T EFFECTED AN INTERESTING COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE CLAIMS OF THE STRICT PAR TISAN AND THE INDEPENDENT THE ACT OF VOTING WAS LEGALLY CON STRUED AS THE DECLARATION OF A BONAFIDE PRESENT INTENTION TO SUPPORT THE PARTY TICKET AT THE ENSUING ELECTION SUCH A PRESENT INTENTION MIGHT OF COURSE BE HONORABLY CHANGED AFTER THE NOMINATIONS HAD BEEN MADE IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE AVOIDED THE PROBLEM OF DEFINING PARTY MEMBERSHIP SIMPLE AS IT MAY APPEAR IT IS HARDLY CAPABLE OF A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION WHILE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THOSE WHO DO NOT INTEND TO SUP PORT THE CANDIDATES OF A PARTY SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM ITS PRIMARY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE SUCH A RESTRICTION WITH OUT DENYING THE CITIZEN THAT FREEDOM OF CHOICE ON ELECTION DAY WHICH OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM CONTEMPLATES IF WE REQUIRE THE VOTER TO PROMISE IN ADVANCE TO SUPPORT THE NOMINEES OF THE PARTY IN WHOSE PRIMARY HE PARTICIPATES WE OBVIOUSLY EITHER PREVENT INDEPENDENT VOTING OR DEPRIVE INDEPENDENT VOTERS OF ALL INFLUENCE OVER PARTY NOMINATIONS SIMILARLY WHEN AFFILIATION WITH THE PARTY AT THE LAST ELECTION IS MADE THE TEST THE VOTER IS TEMPTED TO SUPPORT UNFIT CANDIDATES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN HIS PARTY STANDING ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE WOULD FREELY PERMIT INDEPENDENT VOTING WE MUST ALLOW CITIZENS TO VOTE AT A PRIMARY WITHOUT ASSUMING ANY OBLIGATION TO ABIDE BY ITS ACTION THE INTERESTS OF THE PRI MARY AND OF THE REGULAR ELECTION BEING THUS IN CONFLICT SOME COMPROMISE MUST BE

AND CORRUPTION MAY NEVERTHELESS TOTALLY FAIL TO REFLECT THE SENTIMENT OF THE MAJORITY THE METHOD OF SELECTING CANDIDATESA MATTER OF NO LESS IMPORTANCEHAS USUALLY BEEN DISREGARDED IN SOME STATES THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING SYSTEM IS LEGALLY RECOG NIZED BUT AS A RULE THE WHOLE MATTER IS LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE PARTY COMMITTEE THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN STATES THE GENERAL PRACTICE IS TO NOMINATE BY DIRECT POPULAR VOTE WHILE IN THE NORTH AND WEST THE CONVENTION PLAN PREVAILS IF THE ANALOGY OF THE REGULAR ELECTION SHOULD CONTINUE TO GUIDE LEGISLATURES WE MAY EXPECT TO SEE THE DIRECT VOTE MADE MANDATORY BUT IT IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THAT SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD PROVE A FINAL SOLUTION OF THE NOMINATING PROBLEM THE DIRECT VOTE THOUGH POSSIBLY WELL ADAPTED TO THE CONDITIONS OF SOME SOUTHERN STATES WHERE A RELATIVELY SMALL UPPER CLASS STILL MAINTAINS POLITICAL LEADERSHIP LEAVING TO THE RANK AND FILE OF CITIZENS ONLY A YEA OR NAY IS RADICALLY ILLSUITED TO THE MORE DEMOCRATIC CONDITIONS OF THE NORTH ESPECIALLY OF THE GREAT CITIES ITS ADOPTION WOULD MARK THE FORMAL ABANDONMENT OF MAJORITY RULE A MAJORITY ELECTION BY A HETEROGENEOUS BODY WITHOUT NATURAL LEADERS IS RARELY POSSIBLE EXCEPT AFTER DELIBERATION AND A NUMBER OF BALLOTS AND EVEN THOUGH WE CONCEDE THAT THE NEWSPAPERS FURNISH A MEDIUM FOR AMPLE DISCUSSION IT WILL HARDLY BE CONTENDED THAT IT WOULD BE PRACTICABLE TO HOLD SUCCESSIVE PRIMARY ELECTIONS UNTIL ONE CANDIDATE SHOULD RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES SOME FORM OF INDIRECT NOMINATION APPEARS THEREFORE TO BE A NECESSITY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO DEVISE A SYSTEM WHICH WILL INSURE THE ELECTION OF A TRULY REPRESENTA TIVE CONVENTION UPON THIS PROBLEM PRIMARY REFORMERS SHOULD CONCENTRATE THEIR EFFORTS WAITER J BRANSON PHILADELPHIA PA 67

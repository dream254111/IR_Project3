j100000,Science,1760715,A Kindergarten System of Chemistry,i300371,SCIENCE Assuming as he does that these crania are all preglacial and finding among them both long and short skulls Dr Kollmann arrives inevitably at the conclusion that already in preglacial times the men of America had cranial and facial forms widely dif ferentiated into varieties which have persisted until the present time in spite of lapse of time and change of environment The persistence of type leads him further to question the probability of an alteration of racecharacters from change of environment or the possibility of the development of another more perfect race A KINDERGARTEN SYSTEM OF CHEMISTRY IT appears to be a law that whenever a hypothesis of fundamental importance is intro duced into a science it is utilized for all sorts of purposes for which it was never intended This is certainly true of the valence hypothesis in chemistry The conception that the smallest particles or atoms of the elements differ from each other in regard to the number of other atoms with which they can enter into combina tion is the result of a profound consideration of the facts of chemistry and its significance can be comprehended only by those who have made a deep study of these facts The valence hypoth esis is utterly meaningless to those who do not know considerable about chemical substances and their action upon each other Notwith standing this the mere mechanical considera tions involved in it are so simple and can be so readily illustrated that we find incompetent teachers thrusting them upon the attention of beginners even before any sort of notion has been conveyed in regard to the nature of chemical action or of the distinction between elementary and compound bodies We need only pick up any one of the small textbooks in common use and ten chances to one we shall find an example of the kind of treatment referred to It would be difficult however to find any thing to equal The chemists and students assistant or Kindergarten system of chemis try which has recently been brought to our attention The author or inventor of this sys tem evidently thinks that the essential things in chemistry are not compounds but formulas that if one can manipulate formulas with suffi cient skill he knows chemistry Now in or der to deal with the formulas it is not at all necessary to know any thing about the com pounds represented A very few simple princi ples which a child can thoroughly comprehend The chemists and students assistant or Kindergarten sys iem of chemistry By WILLIAM FARMER New York Author 18841 279 are alone required We are therefore at last in a position to study chemistry without any reference to chemical phenomena The odor of chlorine and of sulphuretted hydrogen the activity of oxygen the conduct of acids to wards bases need no longer be known to the student of chemistry Laboratories for in struction are superfluous All we need is  The chemists assistant This wonderful thing consists of a box containing a number of blocks of different shapes The simplest blocks which represent the simplest atoms have but one angle others have two three four five or six angles and represent respectively the bivalent trivalent quadrivalent etc elements A col lection of such blocks by itself is not a very harmful thing and we can conceive of the blocks being used in connection with a course of instruction in chemistry without leading to an entirely false notion concerning the things represented Their use however would require the greatest care as they would be more likely to do harm than good When we read the authors explanatory words we first recognize the enormity of the system with which he has presented us After stating in general terms how the blocks are to be used he says  For lectures or class illustrations this system will be exceedingly useful for the illustrations on the charts and blackboard will address the eye as well as the mind of the student and conse quently will lead to a quicker conception of the subject lectured upon As this system is identical with that of the kindergarten the young students will be charmed with the various forms which can be made by the elements some of which are ex hibited in the following illustrations We then find some illustrations of chemical reactions which certainly do charm the eye of even the old student The first one represents what takes place when water acts upon calci um oxide Oxygen with its two points joins two singlepointed hydrogen blocks and we have water Calcium twopointed fits close to oxygen also twopointed and we have lime The change to the hydrate or as com mon people call it slaked lime is too abrupt we therefore have an intermediate stage repre sented This is called the  crackedup stage though from the general appearance of the formulas we are inclined to think that it might better be called the  exploded stage Final ly order is restored and we have a peaceful symmetricallooking group which we are glad to be told is  calcic hydrate The idea of including in chemical equations the intermedi ate  crackedup stage is we believe original APRIL 3 1885280 SCI1 with the author It cannot fail to fascinate the youthful student in the kindergarten It has long been maintained that the elements of some of the sciences might be taught with ad vantage in the kindergarten It remained for the inventor of this system to show how readily this may be done The expense is a mere trifle and no preparation on the part of the teacher is required We shall soon find our children making marshgas or  ethene dibro mide or showing how nitrate of potassium and sulphuric acid are converted into nitric acid and hydric potassic sulphate we shall hear them making the fine distinction between plain water and crackedup water and we shall be obliged to confess that the method by which we were taught the elements of chemis try was a very cumbersome one as compared with the simple method of Mr Farmer While fully recognizing the humorous fea tures in the kindcergarten system of chemistry we cannot avoid a feeling of depression when we regard it as evidence of a state of mind which is very prevalent Too many teachers of chemistry like Mr Farmer magnify the importance of formulas and lose sight of the facts which they represent This is the crying evil in chemical instruction at the present time The teacher who knows the theory but doesnt  know the practical side of the sub ject is still abroad in the land FONTAINES OLDEIR MESOZOIC FLORA OF VIRGINIA TinI work is one of the smallest of this series but it is one of merit and importance Although the number of fossil plants from Vir ginia strata here enumerated is not great they are so thoroughly illustrated and so critically discussed that their diagnostic value is fully brought out Professor Fontaine may fairly claim to have demonstrated fiom evidence fur nished by the plants alone that these older mesozoic beds which had not previously been clearly distinguished from the younger ones and had been commonly grouped with the lat ter as the trias of Virginia can scarcely extend so low as the extreme upper trias and conform more closely to the rhaetic of Franconia Bay reuth and Palsj6 or even to the lias of Rajma hal This conclusion of course is derived from Contributions to the knowledge of the older mesozoic flora of Virginia By WILLIAIM AORRIS FONTAINE Washington Government 1883 12  144 p 54 pl Monographs of the U S geological survey vi N IVG  VOL V No 113 an analysis of the species discovered and a study of their affinities with species obtained from strata in other parts of the world whose geological position is fixed with some degree of accuracy This subject is discussed at length The substance of it can be given in a few words The whole number of distinct plants de scribed is fortyfive Eight of these were already known from other localities under es tablished names four more of this class are referred to different genera or species mak ing twelve not confined to Virginia Of the remaining thirtythree which are so confined nine have close affinities with species already described It thus appears that considerably over half of the entire number are peculiar to the locality and have no weight in determin ing its horizon The decision must therefore turn entirely upon the twentyone species which are either themselves found outside of Virginia or are nearly allied to such as are so found The author has made some errors in his table of distribution such as the omission of Schizo neura planicostata which he describes in the text and the failure to assign Ctenophllum Braunianum to its proper horizon rhaetic These corrections made we find that while only one of the species Asterocarpus platy rachis has its nearest affinity with an exclu sively triassic plant and only seven have their nearest affinities with exclusively Jurassic plants there are ten which have either been found in the rhaetic only or are most closely allied to such as have only been so found Thus thirteen species or about fiveeighths may be classed as rhaetic plants and only four or less than onefifth can at best be set down as triassic The seven Jurassic species are mostly from the lias or lower oolite which while not negativing the rhaetic character of the Virginia beds does seem when coupled with the rest of the evidence to negative their triassic character We have not space to go further into details and will merely add that while our analysis of his facts differs slightly from that made by Professor Fontaine the conclusion which flows fIrom it is the same viz that in so far as fos sil plants can be depended upon to correlate the deposits of different parts of the world those of the Richmond coalfields point to the rhaetic of Europe as the age to which they must be referred It is something to have even thus far fixed the geological position of this hitherto unset tled formation but those who are specially interested in the progress which is taking place I r I

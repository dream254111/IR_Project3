J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1005249,ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF THE UPPER MISSOURI,I241971,TRANSACTION1S OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY ARTICLE I ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF THE UPPER MISSOURI BY F V HAYDEN MID READ JULY 19TH 1861 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION IN PRESENTING A REPORT UPON THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE VAST COUNTRY DRAINED BY THE MISSOURI RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES IT IS BUT JUST TO THOSE WHO HAVE PRECEDED ME THAT I SHOULD GIVE A BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE RESULTS OF DIFFERENT TRAVELLERS WHO HAVE PASSED OVER THAT REGION PREMISING HOWVEVER THAT NO DETAILED ACCOUNT HAS HITHERTO BEEN GIVEN OF ITS GEOLOGICAL CHARACTER THE FIRST RELIABLE ACCOUNT OF TLLE UPPER MISSOURI COUNTRY WAS OBTAINED BY THOSE ENTER PRISING TRAVELLERS CAPTAINS LEWIS AND CLARKE AND PUBLISHED IN THEIR EXCELLENT JOURNAL T  BEIN THE SUBSTANCE OF A REPORT MADE TO LIEUT G K WARREN T E U S A BY F V HAYDEN MD SURGEON AND GEOLOGIST OF THE EXPEDITION TO THE UPPER MISSOURI AND YELLOWSTONE UNDER THE COMMAND OF LIEUT WARREN T LEWIS AND CLARKES JOURNAL OF AN EXPEDITION TO THE SOURCES OF THE MISSOURI RIVER PERFORMED DURING THE YEARS 1804 5 AND 6 VOL XII12 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY AND THOUGH THEY APPEAR TO HAVE HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA OF THE GEOLOGICAL AGE OF THE REGION EXAMINIED BY THEM THEY GAVE SO ACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GENERAL PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE BLUFFS COALBEDS C THAT THEIR REPORT HAS PROVED AN EXCELLENT GUIDE TO SUBSEQUENT EX PLORERS THEY OFTENL MENTION BEDS OF  STONE COAL LIGNITE DIFFERENT STRATA OF SANDS SAND STONES CLAYS C YET DO NOT SUGGEST ANY IDEA OF THE AGE OF THESE DEPOSITS A SMALL COLLECTION OF CRETACEOUS FOSSILS OBTAINED BY THESE TRAVELLERS ENABLED DR MORTON TO IDENTIFY THE EXISTENCE OF THE CRETACEOUS FORMATION IN THAT COUNTRY IN 1832 THE PRINCE OF NEUWIED MADE AN EXPEDITION UP THE MISSOURI RIVER AND THE RE SULTS OF HIS TRAVELS WERE EMBODIED IN A MAGNIFICENTLY ILLUSTRATED WORK THE SKETCHES TAKEN FROM NATURE PRESENT A VERY VIVID AND ACCURATE IDEA OF THE COUNTRY HE MENTIONS THE OC CURRENCE IN NUMEROUS LOCALITIES OF SANDS CLAYS AND LIGNITES AND ALSO OBSERVES THAT HE COLLECTED AMMONITES BACULITES AND OTHER CRETACEOUS FOSSILS ALL ALONG THE RIVER FROM THE SOURCES OF THE MISSOURI TO BIG SIOUX THIS STATEMENT LED VON BUCH TO OBSERVE THAT  THIS GREAT RIVER MISSOURI FLOWS UNINTERRUPTEDLY FROM THE FOOT OF THE ROCKY MFOUNTAINS THROUGH STRATA OF CHALK AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE MOUTH OF SIOUX RIVER THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE ACCOUNTS AND COLLECTIONS OF PRINCE NEUWIED AND OF THE REPORT OF THE CELEBRATED ASTRO NOMER NICOLLETT NOTHING VERY DEFINITE WAS ASCERTAINED HOWEVER RESPECTING THE GEOLOGY OF THE COUNTRY BY THIS EXPEDITION EXCEPT TO CONFIRMN THE FACT OF THE EXISTENCE OF A CRETA CEOUS FORMATION ON THE UPPER MISSOURI INDICATIONS OF WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED FROM THE COLLECTIONS OF LEWIS AND CLARLIE HE ALSO OBTAINED A FINE SPECIMEN OF THE REMAINS OF A SAURIAN ANIMAL CHARACTERIZING THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY GOLDFUSS AS MOSASAURUS MAXIMILIANI FRAGMENTS OF WHICH WERE IN THE COLLECTIONS OF LEWIS AND CLARKE THE NEXT IMPORTANT EXPEDITION INTO THAT COUNTRY WAS MADE IN 1839 BY THE DISTINGUISHED GEOGRAPHER NICOLLET HE ASCENDED THE MISSOURI NO FARTHER THAN FORT PIERRE IN LAT 440 23 YET FROM HIS OBSERVATIONS THE FIRST RELIABLE INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED RESPECTING THE EXTENT AND INTEREST OF THE CRETACEOUS ROCKS IN THAT REGION HE SECURED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF CRETACEOUS FOSSILS AT DIFFERENTPOINTS ALONG THE MISSOURI BUT ESPECIALLY AT THE GREAT BEND ALL OF WHICH WERE DESCRIBED BY CONRAD AILD MORTON IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE PHILADELPHIA ACADEMY ALTHOUGH PASSING RAPIDLY TLLROUGH TLLE COUNTRY HE FORMED A TOLERABLY ACCURATE IDEA OF ITS GEOLOGY ANLD GAVE IN HIS RE PORT A VERTICAL SECTION OF THE CRETACEOUS ROCKS WHICH IS CORRECT EXCEPTING THAT HE SEEMS TO HAVE HIAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF NO 2 AND REPRESENTED TWO OF THE SUBDIVISIONS OF NO 3 AS DIS  SYNOPSIS OF THE ORGANIC REMAINS OF THE CRETACEOUS GROUPS OF THE UNITED STATES C BY S G MORTON PHILA DELPHIA 1834 T SILLIMANS JOURNAL SEPTEMBER 1850OF THE UPPER MISSOURI 3 TINCT FORMATIONS NO 1 HE SEEMS TO HAVE REFERRED TO THE CARBONIFEROUS SYSTEM AS HE DID NOT GO ABOVE FORT PIERRE HE SAW NOTHING OF NO 5 THOUGH HE OBTAINED SOME OF ITS CHA RACTERISTIC FOSSILS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO HIM BY MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN FUR COMPANY MR EDWARD HARRIS WLHO ACCOMPANIED MR AUDUBON TO THE MOUTH OF THE YELLOWSTONE IN 1843 WAS INSTRUCTED BY THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES AT PHILADELPHIA TO MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE GEOLOGY OF THAT UNKNLOWN REGION THIS COMMUNICATIONI TO THE ACADEMY ON HIS RETURN WAS VERY INTERESTING AND CONTAINED MANY IMPORTANT FACTS AND FROM HIS NOTES AND COLLECTIONS THE COMMITTEE WERE ABLE TO ARRIVE AT STILL MORE IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS THE COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF PROFESSORS ROGERS MORTON AND JOHNSON RE PORTED THAT THEY FOUND INCONTESTABLE PROOFS OF A FRESHWATER FORMATION IN THAT REGION FROM ONE LOCALITY MR HARRIS OBTAINED A SPECIMEN OF  BROWN FERRUGINOUS ROCK CONTAINING THREE OR FOUR SPECIES OF FRESHWATER UNIVALVE SHELLS OF THE GENERA LIMNEA PLANORHIS C ONE OF THE SPECIES OF PLANORBIS IT IS CONJECTURED MAY BE A FORM EXTINCT BUT THE MUTILATED CONDITION OF THE SPECIMEN PROHIBITS A POSITIVE OPINION THIS BED OF CLAY ALSO CONTAINS LEAVES OF DECIDUOUS TREES BEARING A CLOSE RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE OF THE BEECH AT VARIOUS TIMES SPECIMENS OF MAMMALIAN REMAINS WERE BROUGHT IN BY GENTLEMEN CONNECTED WITH THE AMERICAN FUR COMPANY INDICATING THE EXISTENCE OF AN INTERESTING DEPOSIT ON WHITE RIVER THE FIRST ACCOUNT OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED BY DR H A PROUT OF ST LOUIS IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENICE 1847 IN 1849 DR JOHN EVANS ONE OF THE ASSISTANTS IN THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE CHIPPEWAY LAND DISTRICT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF DR D D OWEN WAS SENT BY THAT GENTLEMAN ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE MAUVAISES TERRES OF WHITE RIVER HE THERE SECURED A FINE COLLECTION OF MAMMALIAN AND CHELONIAN REMAINS WHICH WERE INVESTIGATED BY PROFESSOR LEIDY OF PHILADELPHIA HE ALSO COLLECTED MANY INTERESTING CRETACEOUS FOSSILS WHICH WERE DESCRIBED BY DR OWEN AND PUBLISHED IN HIS FINAL REPORT IN 1852 DR EVANSS OBSERVATIONS EMBRAC ING A SECTION OF THE BAD LANDS TOGETHER WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THEIR PHYSICAL FEATURES WERE ALSO PUBLISHED IN THIS REPORT IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR MR THADDEUS A CULBERTSON VISITED THE UPPER MISSOURI COUNTRY UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION DURING WHICH EXPEDITION HE COLLECTED SOME INTERESTING VERTEBRATE REMAINS FROM THE WHITE RIVER FORMATIONS HE ALSO ASCENDED THE MISSOURI ON THE FUR COMPANYS BOAT TO A POINT ABOVE FORT UNION NOTING THE CHA RACTER OF THE SURFACE OF THE COUNTRY AND THE OCCURRENCE OF LIGNITE BEDS AT VARIOUS LOCALITIES IN THE SPRING OF 1853 DR EVANS AGAIN VISITED THIS COUNTRY INCIDENTALLY WHILE ON HIS WAY TO OREGON TERRITORY IN THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF WHICH HE WAS ENGAGED UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THE GENERAL GOVERNIMENT DURING TLLIS EXPEDITION HE MADE ANOTHER EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF VERTEBRATE REMAINS AND SOME FRESHWATER MOLLUSCA AT THE BAD LANDS OF WHITE4 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY RIVER AS WELL AS SOMIE CRETACEOUS FOSSILS FROM SAGE CREEK THE MAMMALIAN REMAINS OF THIS EXPEDITION WERE ALSO STUDIED BY DR LEIDY AND THE INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS BY DRS EVANS AND SHUMARD AND PUBLISHED IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES AT PHILADELPHIA AND THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF ST LOUIS AT THE SAME TIME 1853 MR F B MEEK AND THE WRITER WERE EMPLOYED BY PROFESSOR JAMNES HALL OF ALBANY NEW YORK TO VISIT THE BAD LANDS OF WHITE RIVER FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING A COLLECTION OF THE TERTIARY AND CRETACEOUS FOSSILS OF THAT REGION MANY IN TERESTING AND IMPORTANT FACTS WERE OBTAINED DURING THE EXPEDITION IN REGARD TO THE GEO LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF TLHE COUNTRY FROM FORT PIERRE TO COUNCIL BLUFFS WHICH FORMED THE BASIS OF A PAPER READ BY PROFESSOR HALL BEFORE THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE AT THE PROVIDENCE MEETINIG IN THE SUMMER OF 1855 THE MAMMALIAN REMAINS COLLECTED DURING THIS TRIP WERE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF DR LEIDY FOR EXAMINATION AND THE NEW SPECIES OF CRETACEOUS FOSSILS WERE INVESTIGATED BY MESSRS HALL AND MAEEK IN AN IN TERESTING MEMOIR PUBLISHED IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENICES AT BOSTON A BRIEF VERTICAL SECTION ACCOMPANIED THIS MEMOIR SHOWING THE ORDER OF THE SUPERPOSITION OF THE DIFFERENT CRETACEOUS BEDS SUBSEQUENT TO ALL THESE EXPEDITIONS THE WRITER AGAIN VISITED NEBRASKA AND SPENT TWO YEARS TRAVERSING VARIOUS PORTIONS OF THAT COUNTRY PART OF WHICH TIME HE WAS AIDED BY COL A J VAUGHAN INDIAN AGENT AND AFTERWARDS BY MR ALEXANDER CULBERTSON AND OTHER GENTLEMEN OF THE ANMERICAN FUR COMPANY DURING THIS EXPEDITION HE EXPLORED THE MIS SOURI TO THE VICINITY OF FORT BENTON AND THE YELLOWSTONE TO THE MOUTH OF BIG HORN RIVER ALSO CONSIDERABLE PORTIONS OF THE BAD LANDS OF WHITE RIVER AND OTHER DISTRICTS NOT IMME DIATELY BORDERING ON THE MISSOURI THE VERTEBRATE REMAINS COLLECTED BY HIM AS MAY BE SEEN BY REFERENCE TO THE VARIOUS PAPERS BY PROF LEIDY IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY EMBRACE A LARGER NUMBER OF SPECIES THAN ALL THOSE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN FROM THAT COUNTRY MANY OF WHICH BELONG TO NEW AND REMARKABLE GENERA LARGE COLLECTIONS OF MOLLUSCA WERE ALSO OBTAINED FROM CRETACEOUS AND TERTIARY FORMA TIONS WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN PUBLISHED BY MR MIEEK AND THE WRITER WITH REMARKS ON THE GEOLOGY OF DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THE COUNTRY IN SEVERAL MEMOIRS READ BEFORE THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES AT PHILADELPHIA THE GEOLOGICAL RESULTS OF THE DIFFERENT EXPEDITIONS ALONG THE MISSOURI AND OTHER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHWEST UNDER THE COMMAND OF LIEUITENANT WARREN ARE EMBODIED IN THE FOLLOWING REPORT IN REGARD TO THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF KANSAS AND THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF NEBRASKA OR THE PLATTE COUNTRY IMPORTANT FACTS WERE SECURED BY THOSE ENTERPRISING EX PLORERS COLS LONG FREMONT AND EMORY AND CAPT STANSBURY THESE HAVE BEEN AL READY PUBLISHED IN THEIR SEVERAL REPORTSOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 5 PART I DESCRIPTIVE GEOLOGY OF THE ROUTES CHAPTER I EXPLORATION OF PLATTE RIVER VALLEY FROM BELLEVUE TO THE MIOUTH OF ELKHORN RIVER LANDED AT BELLEVUE NEBRASKA FIVE MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE PLATTE RIVER FROM THE STEAMER TWILIGHT JUNE 1857 THE SCENERY AT THIS POINT IS PERHAPS THE FINEST ALONG THE MISSOURI THE RIVER BOTTOMS XVHICH ARE QUITE EXTENSIVE POSSESS AN INEXHAUSTIBLE FERTILITY AND SUSTAIN A LUXURIANT VEGETATION WVHILE THE BROAD UPLAND PRAIRIES CLOTHED WITH GRASS AND FLOWERS OF GREAT VARIETY AND BEAUTY MEET THE EYE OF THE TRAVELLER ON EVERY SIDE THE YELLOW SILICIOUS MARL WHICH UNDERLIES THE HIGH PRAIRIES TO A GREAT DEPTH RENDERS THEMN EXCEEDINGLY WELL ADAPTED TO AGRICULTURAL AND GRAZING PURPOSES THE LIMESTONE STRATA WHICH ARE SO MUCH VALUED HERE FOR ECONOMICAL PURPOSES BELONG TO THE AGE OF THE UPPER COAL MEASURES AND CONSTITUTE THE BASIS FORMATION OF THIS REGION A FINE QUARRY MAY BE SEEN NEAR COL P A SARPYS OLD TRADING POST WHICH HAS BEEN DILIGENTLY WROUGHT FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE FOLLOWING SECTION IN DESCENDING ORDER WILL REPRESENT THE DIFFERENT BEDS AS EXPOSED IN THIS VICINITY 1 LIGHT GRAY LIMESTONE WELL CHARGED WITH FOSSILS FUSULINA CYLINDLRICA PRODUCTUS CWONETES AND SEVERAL SPECIES OF CORALS THIS LIMESTONE IS QUITE USEFUL FOR BUILDING PURPOSES AND FORMNS EXCELLENT LIME 2 YELLOWISH DRAB ARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE VERY HARD AND COMPACT USEFUL IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS BUT CON TAINS TOO MUCH CLAY FOR LIME FOSSILS ALLORISMNA TERMINALIS C 6 TO 10 FEET 3 ARGILLACEOUS SHALY LIMESTONE OF A GRAYISH BROWN COLOR FOSSILS SPIR7GERA SUBTILETA FUTSULINA C3YLINDRICA PRODUCTUS SEVERAL SPECIES CHONETES ALLORISNA AND QUITE ABUNDANT CRINOIDAL REMAINS SEEN AT BELLEVUE AT LOW WATER 6 FEET EXPOSED 4 COMPACT BLUE ARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE HAVING MUCH THE CHARACTER OF HYDRAULIC LIMESTONE SOFT AND NMOIST IN PLACE BUT HARDENING ON EXPOSURE CONTAINS TOO MUCH CLAY FOR LIME BUT IS QUITE USEFUL FOR BUILDING PURPOSES FOS SILS SAME AS ABOVE MENTIONED SEEN AT THE MOUTH OF THE PLATTE AND AT ST MARYS IOWA 6 FEET EXPOSED TRIP FROM BLLEVUE TO MOUTH OF ELKHORN RIVERWHILE DELAYING FOR A TIME AT BELLEVUE IN JUNE 1857 I TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A SOMEWVHAT MINUTE EXAMINATION OF THE PLATTE VALLEY AS FAR AS THE MOUTH OF ELKHORN RIVER A DISTANCE OF ABOUT THIRTY MILES HAVING SECURED A HORSE THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF STEPHEN DECATUR ESQ I LEFT BELLEVUE PURSUING A SOUTHERLY COURSE ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL UNDULATING PRAIRIES BORDERING ON THE6 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY MISSOURI TO THE PAPILLION CREEK SAW AT THIS LOCALITY ON MR WATSONS CLAIIN A FINE QUARRY OF GRAY AND YELLOWISH GRAY LIMESTONE SAME AS BED 4 OF THE SECTION ON THE PLATTE RIVER SIX MILES ABOVE ITS MOUTH OBSERVED NUMEROUS LARGE GRANITE BOULDERS SCATTERED OVER THE SURFACE OF THE HIGH HILLS A BED OF SANDSTONE NO 1 LOWER CRETACEOUS MAKES ITS APPEARANCE AT THIS POINT CAPPING THE BLUFFS ITS GENERAL CHARACTER IS A DARK FERRUGINOUS COARSEGRAINED MICACEOUS SANDSTONE BUT SOMETIMES BECOMING A VERY TOUGH COMPACT SILI CIOUS ROCK NEAR THE OLD OTOE VILLAGE EIGHT MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE PLATTE IS A VERY GOOD EXPOSURE EXHIBITING THE SANDSTONE RESTING CONFORMABLY UPON THE CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE WE HAVE HERE TLLE FOLLOWING BEDS IN DESCENDING ORDER FIG 1 1 GRAY COMPACT SILICIOUS ROCK PASSING DOWN INTO A COARSE CONGLOMERATE AN AGGREGATION OF WATERWORN PEBBLES CEMENTED WITH ANGULAR GRAINS OF  6 B QUARTZ THEN A COARSEGRAINED MICACEOUS SANDSTONE 25 FEET 2 YELLOW AND LIGHTGRAY LIMESTONE OF THE COAL NMEASURES CONTAINING NUMER OUS FOSSILS SPIRIFER CAMERATUS SPIRIGERA S6UBTILETA FTSUSINA CYLIN  2    DRICA PRODUCTUS CHONETES AND ABUNDANT CORALS AND CRINOIDAL REMAINS Z EI Z A QUARTZ ROCK 4 CONGLOMERATE C COARSE FRIABLE SANDSTONE 1 CARBONIFER OUS LIMESTONE A SEAM OF CARBONACEOUS SHALE TWELVE TO EIGHTEERN INCHES IN THICKNESS CROPS OUT OCCASION ALLY NEAR THE WATERS EDGE AND IS REGARDED BY THE INHABITANTS AS A SURE INDICATION OF COAL THE GREAT SCARCITY OF TIMBER THROUGHOUT THIS REGION WOULD RENDER SUCH A DISCOVERY OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE BUT I AM INCLINED TO THE OPINION THAT IT IS A GEOLOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY FOR A WORKABLE SEAM OF COAL TO BE FOUND WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE TERRITORY OF NEBRASKA THE LIMESTONES OF SOUTHEASTERN NEBRASKA BELONG TO THE UPPER COAL MEASURES AND FORM THE EXTREME NORTHWESTERN RIM OF THE GREAT COAL BASIN AND INASMUCH AS THE STRATA DIP TOWARD THE NORTHWEST IN ASCENDING THE RIVER AT LEAST ONE FOOT TO THE MILE THERE MUST BE FROM 600 TO 1000 FEET OF CLAYS SHALES AND LIMESTONES OVER THE FIRST SEAM OF COAL TWO FEET IN THICKNESS IN ANY PART OF THE COUNTRY NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE PLATTE A BED OF COAL TO BE REALLY VALUABLE FOR ECONOMICAL PURPOSES SHOULD BE AT LEAST THREE FEET IN THICKNESS AND EVEN THEN IT WOULD NOT PROVE PROFITABLE IF A LARGE AMOUNT OF LABOR WERE REQUIRED IN OPEN ING THE MINE NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE ELKHORN THE SANDSTONIE PRESENTS MUCH THE SAME CLIARACTER AS BEFORE DESCRIBED AT THIS POINT IT REACHES NEARLY TO THE WATERS EDGE SHOWING THAT THE DIP OF THE FORMATIONS IN THIS REGION IS TOWARD THE NORTHWEST HERE FORMATIONL NO 1 IS AT LEAST EIGHTY FEET IN THICKNESS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET OF CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE BEING EX POSED BENEATLH THE LATTER SOON PASSES BENEATH THE WATERLEVEL OF THE RIVER AND THE SAND STONE OCCUPIES THE COUNTRYOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 7 ALTHOUGH ALL THE ROCKS IN THIS REGION ARE COMPOSED OF STRATA FIG 2 HOLDING A HORIZONTAL POSITION OR DIPPINIG AT A VERY SMALL   ANGLE EXAMPLES NOT UNFREQUENTLY OCCUR IN SANDSTONE FORMA Y  TION NO 1 OF WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED  FALSE OR CROSS STRATIFICA TION AS IS SHOWN IN FIG 2 WHICH WAS TAKEN FROM THE BLUFF EXPOSED AT THE MOUTH OF ELKHORN RIVER AND INDICATES THE DIF E FERENT CHANGES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE CURRENTS OF WATER THAT ITT I DEPOSITED THE ARENACEOUS SEDIMENTS STRATA A AND C ARE FORMED J V J II OF THIN HORIZONTAL LAYERS OF SANLDSTONE WHILE THE LAMINA OF STRATUM B SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED UPON AN INCLINED SURFACE IN VERY SHALLOW WATER SIMILAR ILLUSTRATIONS WERE OBSERVED BY THE WRITER IN THE POTSDAM SANDSTONE OF THE BLACK HILLS AND THEY OCCUR FREQUENTLY IN ARENACEOUS ROCKS OF ALL COUNTRIES THE BOTTOMS ALONG THE LOWER PLATTE ARE QUITE BROAD AND EXTREMELY FERTILE POSSESSING A RICH SOIL AND ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO THE WANTS OF THE FARMER FINE CRYSTAL SPRINGS ISSUE FROM THE LIMESTONE BANKS A SUFFICIENCY OF TIMBER SKIRTS THE RIVER OR CLOTHES THE BLUFFS THE CLIMATE IS QUITE DRY AND HEALTHY AND IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE EXTREME COLD OF WINTER THIS REGION WOULD BE ONIE OF THE MOST DESIRABLE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS IN THE WEST THE TIMBER OF THE UPLANDS CONSISTS CHIEFLY OF ASH ELM OAK SOFT MAPLE BOXWOOD C WHILE ALONG THE BOTTOMS THE COTTONWOOD FORMS NINETENTHS OF THE WOODLAND THE LAND WHEN IN A STATE OF NATURE SUPPORTS A MOST LUXURIANT VEGETATION AND WHEN CULTIVATED BY THE FARMER BRINGS FORTH VERY ABUNDANT CROPS THE VALLEY OF THE ELKHORN IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PLATTE AND THE LAND IS AT THIS TIME MOSTLY TAKEN UP BY THE ACTUAL SETTLER THE BLUFFS ARE FORMED OF SANDSTONE NO 1 OFTEN PRESENTING LOFTY VERTICAL WALLS WHICH FROM THE YIELDING NATURE OF THE ROCK ARE OF GREAT SERVICE TO THE INDIAN UPON WHICH TO RECORD HIS HIEROGLYPHICAL ILISTORY ON MY RETURN TO BELLEVUE I PASSED OVER THE UPLANLD PRAIRIE SEVERAL MILES NORTH OF THE PLATTE ALREADY NEARLY EVERY VALUABLE CLAIM WAS OCCUPIED BY THE PERSEVERING PIONEER AND AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH THE PLAIN WAS DOTTED OVER WITH FARMHOUSES GIVING IT MUCH THE APPEARANCE OF AN OLDSETTLED COUNTRY VERY LITTLE TIMBER HOWEVER IS TO BE SEEN EXCEPT THAT WHICH SKIRTS THE SMALL TRIBUTARIES OF THE PLATTE THE SOIL UPON THE SURFACE IS COM POSED OF A RICH VEGETABLE MOULD THE RESULT OF THE ANNUAL DECAY OF A LUXURIANT VEGETATION UNDERLAID BY A YELLOW SILICIOUS MARL AND IS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED FOR THE CULTIVATION OF ALL KINDS OF CEREAL GRAINS AND FOR GRAZING PURPOSES WHEN THE PRAIRIE TURF IS BROKEN UP BY THE PLOUGH AND ALLOWED TO DECAY THE LAND BECOMES LIKE A GARDEN THE SOIL IS SO LOOSE THAT IT IS TILLED WITH GREAT EASE BUT FROM THIS VERY FACT IS LIABLE TO SUFFER EXTENSIVELY FROM THE WASH OF THE HEAVY DRENCHING RAINS OF MAY AND JUNE8 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY CHAPTER II FROM BELLEVUE TO THE BIG SIOUX RIVER AFTER HAVING ARRANGED MY COLLECTIONS FOR TRANSPORTATION TO ST LOUIS I PROCEEDED TO EX PLORE THAT PORTION OF NEBRASKA WHICH BORDERS ON THE MISSOURI FROM BELLEVUE TO THE MOUTH OF BIG SIOUX RIVER PASSING OVER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY SIMILAR TO THAT JUSTDESCRIBED UNDERLAID WITH CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE WE FIND THAT FORT LISA IS THE HIGHEST POINT ON THE RIVER WHERE THESE ROCKS ARE EXPOSED AT TEKAMA THE FERRUGINOUS SANDSTONE ALONE IS SEEN PRESENTING ITS USUAL LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS AND CONTAINING MUCH IRON THIS ENTIRE FORMA TION ABOUNDS WITH IRON ORE OF THE RED HEMATITE VARIETY WHICH IF THE DEFICIENCY OF FUEL IN THE COUNTRY CAN BE SUPPLIED FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE MIGHT BE MADE OF GREAT ECONOMICAL IMPORTANCE FROM THIS SANDSTONE ISSUE SOME EXCELLENT SPRINGS OF WATER THE MOST IM PORTANT ONE IS GOLDEN SPRING AT CENTRAL BLUFFS WHICH YIELDS A LARGE SUPPLY OF PURE COLD WATER AND WILL AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD BECOME A GREAT RESORT FOR SEEKERS AFTER HEALTH AND PLEASURE FROM DE SOTO TO DECATUR A DISTANCE OF FORTY MILES THE RIVER BOTTOM ON THE NEBRASKA SIDE OF THE MISSOURI AVERAGES ABOUT FIVE MILES IN WIDTH FORMING A LEVEL PRAIRIE WITH HERE AND THERE A SMALL GROVE OF COTTONWOOD ON THE IOWA SIDE FROM COUNCIL BLUFFS TO SER GEANTS BLUFFS A DISTANCE OF ONE HUNDRED MILES THE BOTTOM AVERAGES ABOUT TEN MILES IN WIDTH COVERED IN MANY PLACES WITH HEAVY BODIES OF TIMBER CHIEFLY COTTONWOOD WITH A MINGLING TO SOME EXTENT OF ASH ELM BLACK WALNUT C THESE BROAD BOTTOMS POSSESS AN INEXHAUSTIBLE FERTILITY AS IS SHOWN BY THE ANNUAL GROWTH OF VEGETATION WHICH YEAR BY YEAR DECAYING ADDS STILL MORE TO THE RICHNESS OF THE SOIL THE SUBSOIL SEEMS TO BE COMPOSED OF CALCAREOUS AND SILICIOUS MARLS FORMED FROM ERODED MATERIALS OF THE CRETACEOUS AND TERTIARY ROCKS WHICH HAVE BEEN WASHED DOWN BY THE RIVER AND MINGLED TOGETHER UPON ITS BOTTOMS ABOVE FORT LISA THE FIRST CUT BANKS WE OBSERVED WHICH AFFORD A GOOD SECTIOLL OF THE BEDS ARE AT WOODS BLUFFS LNEAR DECATUR SECTION OF THE STRATA IN DESCENDING SERIES 1 YELLOW SILICIOUS MARL A RECENT DEPOSIT 15 FEET 2 YELLOW INDURATED CLAY WITH A REDDISH TINGE ALSO RECENT 6 TO 8 FEET 3 ILEAVYBEDDED SANDSTONE 40 TO 50 FEET 4 YELLOW INDURATED CLAY PASSING DOWN INTO AN INDURATED ASHCOLORED CLAY WITH A REDDISH TINGE 5 FEET 5 ASHCOLORED CLAY WITH A SMALL SEAM OF LIGNITE AT BASE 25 FEET NO FOSSILS WERE OBSERVED AT THIS LOCALITY EXCEPTING QUITE UNCHARACTERISTIC VEGETABLE REMAINS BUT NEAR THE B LACKBIRD MISSION EIGHT MILES ABOVE THE SANDSTONE IS QUITE RICHOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 9 IN IMPRESSIONS OF DICOTYLEDONOUS LEAVES THE FOLLOWING SECTION OF THE BEDS IN DESCENDING ORDER IS EXPOSED AT THIS POINT 1 YELLOW MARL RECENT 10 TO 15 FEET 2 YELLOWISH AND LIGHT GRAY FINE INDURATED GRIT RECENT 10 TO 15 FEET 3 A REDDISH FRIABLE SANDSTONE PASSING DOWN INTO A VERY TOUGH COMNPACT SILICIOUS ROCK OF A GREENISH GRAY COLOR THE WHOLE BED FULLY CHARGED WITH VEGETABLE IMPRESSIONS QUITE WELL PRESERVED 10 TO 20 FEET 4 FORTY FEET SLOPE THE ROCKS THOUGH NOT EXPOSED AT THIS POINT ARE EVIDENTLY FORMED OF MORE FRIABLE SANDSTONE AS IS SHOWN BY THE PERPENDICULAR BLUFFS CUT BY THE RIVER THREE MILES ABOVE ALSO AT WOODS BLUFFS NEAR DECATUR THE MORE COMPACT SILICIOUS ROCK HAS BEEN QUARRIED DURING THE WINTER AND SPRING AND USED IN CONSTRUCTING A FINE THREESTORY BUILDING FOR THE OMAHA MISSION AND IT WAS FOUND TO SERVE AN EXCELLENT PURPOSE THE WHOLE BED AT THIS LOCALITY SEEINS TO BE FILLED WITH IM PRESSIONS OF LEAVES MOSTLY OF DICOTYLEDONOUS TREES SOME OF THEM CLOSELY ALLIED TO OUR RECENT OAKS WILLOWS C WITH MIANY FORMS NOT REPRESENTED AMONG LIVING SPECIES FRAG MENTS OF SILICIFIED WOOD ABOUND WITH GLOBULAR MASSES OF THE SULPHURET OF IRON FIG0 3 THE BLUFFS OF SANDSTONE NEAR THIS LOCALITY OFTEN PRESENT THE APPEARANCE SHOWN BY FIG 3 THE WHOLE SULFACE BEING COVERED WITH PROJECTING SEAMS OF IRON THE MORE YIELDING ARENA CEOUS MATERIAL BEING ERODED GIVING TO THE FACE OF THE BLUFF A VERY RUGGED ASPECT AFTER STOPPING AT BLACKBIRD HILL THREE DAYS ENJOYING THE HOSPITALITY OF DR STURGIS THE GENTLEMANLY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE MISSION I PURSUED MY COURSE ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER TOWARD THE BIG SIOUX ABOUT FORTY MILES DISTANIT THE RED SANDSTONE NO 1 IS THE PRINCIPAL ROCK IN THAT REGION BUT UPON THE SANDSTONE I OFTEN FOUND LAYERS OF RATHER VOL XIL210 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY SOFT YELLOWISH WHITE LIMESTONE FULLY CHARGED WITH INOCERARNUS PROBLEM7ATICUS AND FISH REMAINIS NEAR THE NORTH SIDE OF THE OMAHA RESERVE ANOTHER BOTTOM COMMENCES AVERAGING ABOUT FIVE MILES IN WIDTHGREATEST WIDTH TEN MILESEXTENDING UP THE MISSOURI ABOVE THE VIL LAGE OF ST JOHNS DACOTA CITY IS LOCATED ON THIS BROAD LEVEL BOTTOM AT SIOUX CITY ON THE IOWA SIDE IS A FINE QUARRY IN FORMATION NO 1 WHICH HAS YIELDED MUCH EXCELLENT BUILDINGSTONE AND MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONVERT IT INTO LIME THE SIMPLE APPLICATION OF AN ACID WOULD HAVE SHOWN IT TO BE NEARLY DESTITUTE OF CALCAREOUS MATTER THE WHOLE BED PRESENTS THE VARIATION IN COLOR AND STRUCTURE PECULIAR TO THIS ROCK THE MORE COMPACT STRATUM EXTENDS BELOW THE WATER LEVEL AND WILL AT SOME FLTUIRE DAY FORM A SUPERIOR LANDING FOR STEAMBOATS A FEW FOSSILS HAVE BEEN FOUNLD AT THIS LOCALITY IMPRESSIONS OF LEAVES LIKE THE COMMON WILLOW AND SOME MOLLUSCOUS REMAINS SCATTERED OVER THE HIGH HILLS ARE EXPOSURES OR OUTLIERS OF FORMATION NO 3 THE ROCK OF WHICH IS EX TREMELY CALCAREOUS AND IS EAGERLY SOUGHT AFTER BY THE INHABITANTS AND CONVERTED INTO LIME I SAW A LOAD OF THIS LIME SOLD AT SIOUX CITY FOR THE ENORMOUS PRICE OF ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTYFIVE CENTS PER BUSHEL IN THE VALLEY OF THE BIG SIOUX RIVER ABOUT THREE MILES ABOVE ITS MOUTH A BED OF LIGNITE IS EXPOSED EIGHTEEN INCHES TO TWO FEET IN THICKNESS BUT VERY IMPURE THIS IS THE SAME STRATUM SEEN NEAR THE OMAHA MISSION AT OMADI AND OTHER POINTS ALONG THE RIVER AS WE PASS UP THE VALLEY OF THE BIG SIOUX WE SEE THE DIFFERENT CRETACEOUS BEDS NOS 1 2 3 AND 4 REPRESENTED WITH A FEW OF THEIR PECULIAR FOSSILS NO 1 CONTAINS A PECTANCUIU8 A CYTHEREA A PHOLAS WITH NUMEROUS VEGETABLE REMAINS NOS 2 AND 3 CONTAIN OSTREA CONGESTA INOCERAMUS PROBLEMATICUS AND ABUNDANT FISH REMAINS NO 4 HAS YIELDED NOTLLING CHARACTERISTIC AS YET AT THIS LOCALITY AND IS ONLY THINLY REPRESENTED ON THE SUMMITS OF THE BLUFFS AS WE PASS THE MOUTH OF THE BIG SIOUX LATITUDE 42I0 LONGITUDE 96I THE COUNTRY BEGINS GRADUALLY TO LOSE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ITS FERTILE CHARACTER MANY KINDS OF TREES AS THE SOFT MAPLE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF OAKS ONLE SPECIES OF ELM ULMUS FULRA BUTTERNUT BLACK WALNUT WILD LOCUST C REACH THEIR LIMITS AND MANY OTHERS HAVE ALREADY CEASED TO APPEAR FROM THENCE TO THE MOUNTAINS ILOT MORE THANL FIVE OR SIX SPECIES OF FOREST TREES ARE SEEN AND THESE APPEAR VERY SELDOM EXCEPT ALONIG THE BORDERS OF STREAMS RLETURNING AGAIN TO JOIN THE EXPEDITION AT OMALHA CITY I FOUND THE TRAVELLING VERY DIFFI CULT AND WAS MUCH DELAYED A SEVERE STORM OF RAIN HAD SWOLLENI ALL THE SMALL STREAMS TO AN ENORMOUS EXTENT SO THAT THE BRIDGES WERE ALL SWEPT AWAY TRLIE YIELDING NATURE OF THE ALLUVIAL BANKS OF STREAMS AND THE WANT OF FIRM ROCK FOUNDATIONS RENDER IT DIFFICULT TO ERECT PERMANENT BRIDGES WHICH WILL RESIST THE STRONG POWER OF THE CURRENT OF THE RIVERS WHEN SWOLLEN TO THEIR GREATEST HEIGHT AS THEY FREQUENTLY ARE IN THE MONTHS OF MAY AND JUNE AFTER ANL EXAMINATION OF THAT PORTION OF NEBRASKA ALREADY OCCUPIED BY SETTLERS I CAME TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONSOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 11 1 THAT THE PORTION OF NEBRASKA EAST OF LONGITUDE 980 POSSESSES A VERY FERTILE SOIL A SUFFICIENCY OF TIMBER FOR ALL IMMEDIATE PURPOSES IS WELL WATERED AND IS SURPASSED BY FEW PORTIONS OF THE WEST AS AN AGRICULTURAL AND GRAZING COUNTRY 2 THAT EXCEPT IN THE SOUTHEASTERN OR LIMESTONE REGION THERE ARE VERY FEW GOOD QUARRIES OF STONE FOR BUILDING OR OTHER ECONOMICAL PURPOSES 3 THAT FROM ITS GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE THE EXISTENCE OF WORKABLE BEDS OF COAL IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PORTION OF NEBRASKA IS QUITE PROBLEMATICAL 4 THAT WITH THE EXCEPTIONI OF IRONI IN MODERATE QUANTITIES NO MINERALS WILL BE FOUNID THAT CAN BE RENDERED VALUABLE FOR ECONOMICAL USES CHAPTER III FROM OMAHIA CITY TO FORT LARAMIE JULY 3D THE COUNTRY FROM OMAHA CITY TO ELKHORN RIVER AS I HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED IS MOSTLY UNDERLAID BY LIMESTONES OF THE UPPER COAL MEASURES A GREAT THICKNESS OF YELLOW MARL A MODERN DEPOSIT COVERS THE PLAIN UNIFORMLY CONCEALING THE LIMESTONES EXCEPT IN A FEW LOCALITIES THE PRAIRIE IS AS USUAL UNDULATING ON THE ELKHORN THE FERRUGINOUS SANDSTONE NO 1 LOWER CRETACEOUS OCCUPIES THE COUNTRY FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILES UP THE PLATTE VALLEY IT IS SELDOM SEEN OWING TO A GREAT THICKNESS OF A SUPERFICIAL DEPOSIT COMPOSED OF POST PLIOCENE MARLS IT IS EXPOSED IN THE VALLEY OF THE LOUP FORK NEAR ITS MOUTH AND IS EXCEEDINGLY FRIABLE IN ITS TEXTURE ON THE DISTANT HILLS REMNANTS OF NO 3 ARE SEEN BUT NO 2 SEEMS WANTING AS WE FOLLOW UP THE PLATTE VALLEY FROM THE ELKHORN THE TIMBER GRADUALLY DISAPPEARS IN THE SAME MANNER AS ON THE MISSOURI THE BOTTOM IS BROAD AND FERTILE AND THE UPLAND OWING TO THE YIELDING NATURE OF THE SANDSTONE WHICH UNDERLIES IT BECOMES MORE UNIFORMLY ROLLING TLLAN THE LIMESTONE REGION NEAR THE MISSOURI JULY 20TH INDICATIONIS OF NO 3 WERE SEEN IN THE BED OF BEAVER CREEK NEAR THE WATERS EDGE JULY 21ST NEAR THE OLD PAWNEE VILLAGE I OBSERVED NO 3 CLOSE TO THE WATERS EDGE PRESENTING ITS USUAL LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS WITH A FEW SPECIMENS OF ILNOCERAMUS PROBLENIA TICUS AND OVERLYING IT STRAY MASSES OF A PEBBLY CONGLOMERATE CEMENTED WITH A CALCA REOUS GRIT UNDOUBTEDLY BELONGING TO THE UPPER BEDS OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION AFTER LEAVING BEAVER CREEK I OBSERVED A CHANGE IN THE EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE HILLS MORE12 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY ABRUPTLY UNDULATING AS WELL AS IN THEIR LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS AND AM NOW CONVINCED THAT THEY BELONG TO THE UPPER MEMBERS OF THE TERTIARY PROBABLY POST PLIOCENE BUT YET HOLDING A LOWER POSITION THAN THE YELLOW MARLS OF THE MISSOURI JULY 22D ABOUT TWO MILES ABOVE OUR CAMP LOUP FORK CUTS THROUGH UNDOUBTED TER TIARY BEDS THE FOLLOWINLG SECTION WILL SHOW THE STRATA IN DESCENDING ORDER 1 YELLOWISH BROWN LAMINATED GRIT EFFERVESCING WITH MURIATIC ACID 2 SIMILAR TO THE BED ABOVE BUT OF A DEEPER COLOR AND CONTAINING A GREATER PER CENT OF CLAY WITH NUMEROUS CALCA REOUS CONCRETIONS DISSEMINATED THROUGH IT 75 TO 100 FEET 3 LIGHT BROWN CLAY WITH MANY WHITISH PARTICLES LIKE MAGNESIA 20 FEET 4 GRAY COARSE GRIT FORMING A HEAVYBEDDED SANDSTONE REACHING TO THE WATERS EDGE 30 FEET IN BED 2D I FOUND FRAGMENTS OF THE BONES OF MAMMALS AND TURTLES AND THE WHOLE SERIES MAY BE REFERRED TO THE PLIOCENE PERIOD AT THE MOUTH OF CALAMUS RIVER THE STRATA ARE REPRESENTED AS FOLLOWS 1 YELLOWISH BROWN GRIT 12 FEET 2 LIMESTONE ASSUMING A CONERETIONARY FORIN 2 TO 25 FEET 3 CALCAREOUS CLAY QUITE INDURATED 6 FEET EXPOSED ABOVE THE WATERS EDGE LIEUTENANT WARREN EXPLORED THE CALAMUS FORK FOR ABOUT 30 MILES ABOVE ITS MOUTH AND SAW THE SAME BEDS REPRESENTED IN THE ABOVE SECTION SOMETIMES WITH AN AGGREGATE THICK NESS OF FIFTY FEET AND GATHERED FROM THEM NUMEROUS WATERWORN FRAGMENTS OF BONES AND SHELLS OF TURTLES JULY 25TH SOON AFTER LEAVING CAMP A BED OF ARENACEOUS LIMESTONIE WAS OBSERVED IN SEVERAL LOCALITIES APPARENTLY COUTAINING TRACES OF ORGANIC REMAINS THERE WERE MANY SILICI FIED TUBES RAMIFYINIG THROUGH THE ROCK WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN THE STEMS OF PLANTS ALSO MANY SEEDS LIKE CHERRYSTONES SOMETIMES THE ROCK BECOMES A PARTIAL CONGLOMERATE THE INCO HERENT MATERIAL ABOVE AND BELOW THE MORE COMPACT BED IS A YELLOW MARL JULY 27TH TERTIARY BEDS WERE OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND A FEW BONES AND TEETH WERE COLLECTED JULY 28TH PASSED OVER A COUNTRY VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF YESTERDAY BUT THE HIGH HILLS ARE BECOMING APPARENTLY MORE RUGGED THEY ARE CUT THROUGH BY NIUMEROUS STREAMS FORM ING RAVINES ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FEET IN DEPTH THE SANDHILLS ARE ALSO APPEARING JULY 29TH PASSED THROUGH THE SANDHILLS ALL DAY THEY HAVE NOW BECOINE QUITE CONSPICUOUS RISING TO THE HEIGHT OF FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED FEET AUGUST 1ST MIEASURED THE HEIGHT OF THE SANDHILLS FROM

UNDISTURBED BUT LOOKING UPON THE OP POSITE SIDE WE FIND THAT THE STRATA DIP TOWARDS THE PRAIRIE BELOW AT AN ANGLE OF 200 TO 30 THIS RIDGE IS COMPOSED OF A GREAT THICKNESS OF NO 1 PASSING DOWN INTO VARIEGATED CLAYS AND GRITS ONE HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET IN THICKNESS FROM WHICH I OBTAINED ANM MONITES BELERNNITES AND OTHER FOSSILS OF JURASSIC TYPES IN GREAT ABUNDANCE PURSUING OUR COURSE EASTWARD WE PASSED THROUGH A VALLEY BETWEEN TWO OF THE UPHEAVED RIDGES WHICH SURROUND THE BLACK HILLS IN THIS VALLEY WE OBSERVED A BED OF BLUISH ASHCOLORED LIME STONE E OF VERTICAL SECTIOLN WHICH PRESENTS MANY PECULIARITIES FROM THE DISTURBING INFLU ENCES WHICH HAVE ELEVATED TLLIS PORTION OF THE COUNTRY SOMETIMES IT FORMS OVER LARGE AREAS A SORT OF TESSELLATED PAVEMENT FROM THE PECULIAR FRACTURE OF ITS SURFACE AGAIN IT IS PUFFED OUT AS IT WERE FORMING ROUNDED PROTUBERANCES THIRTY TO SIXTY FEET IN HEIGHT THE EXTERNAL SURFACE YIELDING SO AS TO ADAPT ITSELF TO ANY INEQUALITIES IT THUS HOLDS A GREAT VARIETY OF POSITIONS ALL ALONG THE VALLEYS AND ON THE HILLS ARE LARGE EXPOSURES OF THE BRICKRED GRIT BED D WITH INTERCALATED SEAMS OF GYPSUM VARYING IN THICKNESS FROM ONE INCH TO FOUR OR

COVERED WITH PERPETUAL SNOW ARE THE GIRDLE AND SNLOWY MOUNTAINS QUITE FORMIDABLE OUTLIERS OF THE GREAT ROCKY MOUNTAINI RANGE ON OUR RIGHT ABOUT TLHIRTY MILES FROM THE MISSOURI RIVER WE OBSERVE THE BEARS PAW AND LITTLE ROCKY MOUNTAINS SMALL ISOLATED RANGES FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE THE HIGHEST PEAKS OF WHICH ARE FROM 1500 TO 2000 FEET ABOVE THE SURROUNDING PRAIRIE ALL THESE ISOLATED UPHEAVALS OR OUTLIERS SEEM TO REPRESENT TLHE DYING OULT OF THAT INTENSE SUBTERRANEAN POWER WHICH ELEVATED THE VAST CEN1TRAL CHAIN IF WE RETURN AND ASCEND THE SHYEINNE RIVER THE FIRST INLDICATION OF UPHEAVAL WHICH COMES TO OUR NOTICE IS BEARS PEAK NEAR LONGITUDE 103210 RISING CONELIKE TO THE HEIGHT OF 1500 FEET ABOVE THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY THIS PEAK IS ALSO COMPOSED OF TRACHYTIC AND BASALTIC ROCKS AND SEEMS TO HAVE EXPOSED AROUND ITS BASE THE FOSSILIFEROUS BEDS NO LOWER DOWN THAN THE JURASSIC OR THE UPPER PORTION OF THE PERMIAN WE CAN THUS FORM SOME IDEA OF THE VAST AREA IN THE NORTHWEST OCCUPIED BY ROCKS WITH STRATA HOLDING A NEARLY HORIZONTAL POSITION IF WE PASS UP THE VALLEY OF TLHE PLATTE RIVER FROM ITS NMOUTH NLEAR LAT 410 LONG 960 WE FIND THE STRATA UNDISTURBED UNTIL WE REACH FORT LARAMIE IN LAT 4210 LONIG 1042O ABOUT FIVE MILES NORTH OF THE FORT WE SEE THE EASTERN END OF A SERIES OF RIDGES FORMED OF NUMEROUS CONICAL PEAKS FROM 100 TO 700 FEET IN HEIGHT THE CENTRAL NLUCLEUS COMPOSED OF A COARSE FLESHCOLORED FELDSPATHIC GRANITE SURROUNDED BY A SERIES OF BEDS OF STRATIFIED AZOIC ROCKS TILTED AT ALL ANLGLES THE LOWEST RIDGES OR MORE GENTLE UPHEAVALS ARE

SIDE OF THE PLATTE I OBSERVED THE CARBONIFEROUS BEDS IN BUT TWO LOCALITIES WARM SPRING AND COTTON WOOD CREEK WHERE THEY ARE EXPOSED AT EACH LOCALITY OVER AN AREA OF NOT MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED YARDS SQUARE PROCEEDING NORTHWARD FROM FORT LARAMIE WE MEET WITH FRE QUENT ELEVATIONS REVEALING A NUCLEUS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS WHILE ON THE SIDES AND SUMMITS ARE BEDS OF CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE THE HIGHEST PEAK IN THIS DIRECTION FORMING THE EASTERN LIMIT OF THE LARAMIE GROUP IS RAWHIDE PEAK WHICH IS 800 FEET HIGH AND HAS A SIMILAR GEOLOGICAL ANID MINIERALOGICAL STRULCTURE TO LARAMIE PEAK AND BLACK HILLS NO CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS WERE SEEN IMMEDIATELY IN CONTACT WITH RAWHIDE PEAK CONTINUING OUR COURSE TO WARD THE BLACK HILLS THE INDICATION OF TLLE INTERNLAL FORCES WHICH ELEVATED THE LARAMIE

HORIZONITAL POSITION THE GREATER PORTION HOWEVER IN CLINING AT AN ANGLE OF 200 TO 400 FROM OUR EXAMINATIONS WE THUIS FIND THAT THE IMPORTANT OUTLIERS ON THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS ARE FORMED OF A GRANITE NUCLEUS SURROUNDED BY A SERIES OF AZOIC STR ATA COMPOSED OF ARGILLACEOUS AND TALCOSE SLATES GNEISS SYENITE QUARTZOSE AND CALCAREOUS ROCKS FROM THESE FACTS AND FROM PUBLISHED REPORTS OF NUMEROUS EXPLORERS WE THINK WE ARE WAR RANTED IN THE CONCLUSION THAT THE GREAT CENTRAL ROCKY MOUNITAIN RAINGE POSSESSES A SIMILAR GEOLOGICAL AND MIINERALOGICAL CHARACTER THE INVESTIGATIONS OF SIR JOLHN RICHARDSON AND MR ISBISTER INDICATE A STRIKING SIMILARITY IN THE ROCKS ALL ALONG THE EASTERN SLOPE FROM THE SASKACHEWAN TO THE ARCTIC SEA AND THE RESULTS OF THE OTHER EXPLORERS SHOW A LIKE RESEM BLANCE FAR SOUTH TO MEXICO THE AZOIC STRATA WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AS RESTING UPON GRANITE ON THE EASTERNI SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS APPEAR TO BE SIMILAR IN LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS AND TO HOLD THE SAME GEOLOGICAL POSITION AS THE AZOIC ROCKS SO LARGELY DEVELOPED AROUND LAKE SUPERIOR AND IN CANADA C HAP TER VIII II POTSDAM SANDSTONE LOWER SILURIAN THE EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS

SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES CHAPTER IX III AN IV CARBONIFEROUS AND PERMIAN PERIODS IN A FORMER PAPER I GAVE TO THE PERMIAN ROCKS OF KANSAS THE POSITION OF A DISTINCT SYSTEM IN THE KANSAS AND NEBRASKA SERIES SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATIONS HAVE RENDERED IT SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THE RANK OF AN INDEPENDENT SYSTEM AS DEVELOPED IN KANSAS BUT RATHER SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A CONTINUATION UPWARD OF THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD FOR THIS REASON I HAVE CONCLUDED TO TREAT BOTH SUBJECTS UNDER ONE HEAD IN TLLE FIRST PLACE I WILL GIVE A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE DISCOVERY OF ROCKS IN THE WEST CONTAINING FOSSILS BELONGING TO PERMIAN TYPES AND SUPPOSED TO BE ON A LARALLEL WITH THE PERMIAN BEDS OF EUROPE THE DISCOVERIES OF MR HAWN IN NORTHEASTERN KANSAS WERE ANNOUINCED IN FEBRUARY 1858 IN A PAPER READ BEFORE THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT ST LOUIS IN WHICH A NUMBER OF NEW SPECIES OF FOSSILS WERE DESCRIBED AND OTLHERS CONSIDERED AS IDENTICAL WITH FORMS CHARACTERIZING THE PERMIAN ROCKS OF EUROPE MARCH 2D OF THE SAME YEAR A PAPER ENTITLED  DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW ORGCANIC REMAINS FROM NORTHEASTERN KANISAS INDICATING THE EXISTENCE OF PERMIAN ROCKS IN THAT TERRITORY WAS READ BEFORE THE ALBANY INSTITUTE BY F B MEEK AND THE WRITER IN WHICH WERE DESCRIBED TEN IEWV SPECIES OF FOSSILS MOST OF WHICLH SEEMED TO BELONG TO TRUE PERMIAN TYPES AT A MEETING OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT ST LOUIS MARCH 8TH DR SHUMARD STATED THAT HE HAD BEEN STUDYING A GROUP OF FOSSILS FROM A WHITE LIMESTONE IN THE GUADALUPE MOUNTAINS OF NEW MRLEXICO AND ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY ARE OF PERMIAN AGE ILE SAYS THAT SEVERAL OF THE SPECIES ARE IDENTICAL WITH PERMIAN FORMS FROM ENGLAND AND RUSSIA ALSO WITH SPECIES OBTAINED FROM THE PER MIAN ROCKS IN KANSAS IN A LETTER TO THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT ST LOUIS DATED MARCH 31ST DR NORWOOD ANNOUNCED THE DISCOVERY OF PERMIAN FOSSILS IN ILLINOIS AND AT THE MEETING OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE AT BALTIMORE IN APRIL MR A I1 WORTHEN STATE GEOLOGIST OF ILLINOIS READ A PAPER ON THE PERMIAN ROCKSOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 139 OF THAT STATE AND EXHIBITED A FIUE COLLECTION OF FOSSILS WHICH HE CONSIDERED AS BELONGING TO THAT SYSTEM PROF HALL IN HIS IOWA REPORT THINKS THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF THE OCCUR RENCE OF THE SAME SERIES OF ROCKS IN WESTERN IOWA SO THAT WE ALREADY HAVE INDICATIONS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE SUPPOSED PERMIAN SYSTEM IN KANSAS NEBRASKA NEW MEXICO ILLINOIS AND IOWA AND FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS MAY REVEAL IT IN MISSOUIRI AND OTHER WESTERN STATES DURING THE PAST SUMMER MR F B MEEK AND THE WRITER MADE A GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF THAT PORTION OF KANSAS BORDERING UPON THE KANSAS RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES FOR THE PUR POSE OF ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE THE INITERESTING PROBLEM OF THE

IN NO 5 OF THE SECTION AT LEAVENWORTH LANDING WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THESE BEDS OCCUPY THE SAME GEOLOGICAL HORIZON IT IS VERY DIFFICULT LHOWEVER TO IDENTIFY THE SAME BEDS AT DIFFERENT LOCALITIES AMONGST THESE FORMLIATIONS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT THE FOSSILS FOUND IN THEM USUALLY HAVE A GREAT VERTICAL RANGE AND EXACTLY SIMILAR STRATA ARE OFTEN REPEATED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE SERIES SHOULD IT PROVE TO BE THE CASE THAT THEY DO OCCUPY THE SAME GEOLOGICAL HORIZON IT WOULD SHOW THAT THERE IS HERE A GENTLE EASTWARD DIP FOR THE LOWEST BED OF THIS SECTION ON GRASSLHOPPER CREEK CANNOT BE

IS PRESENTED IN ITS PRESENT FORM MORE WVITH A VIEW OF ILLUSTRATING THE VERTICAL RANGE OF THE ORGYANIC RE MAINS FOUND IN THESE ROCKS THANI AS AN ATTEMPT TO GROUP THE BEDS INTO FORMATIONS THAT MAY BE EXPECTED TO PRESERVE THEIR DISTINCTIVE LITLHOLOGICAL CLHARACTERS THIROUGHLOUT AREAS OF ANY GREAT EXTENLT AS THIS HAS NECESSARILY BEEN DONE FROM A LKNOWLEDGE OF ONLY A PORTION OF THE FOSSILS CHARACTERIZING THESE STRATA IT IS QTUITE PROBABLE WHEN MORE EXTENSIVE COLLECTIONS ARE OBTAINED THAT IT MLAY BE FOUND NECESSARY EVEN ON TLLIS PRINCIPLE TO CLASSIFY AND GROUP THE BEDS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY WE ARE ALSO AWARE THAT SOME OF THESE BEDS PROBABLY IN CREASE OR DIMINIISH GREATLY IN THICKNESS OR MAY EVEN ENTIRELY THIN OUT AT NO VERY GREAT DISTANLCES FROM THE LOCALITIES WHERE WVE SAW THEM AMONG THE MORE PECULIAR FEATURES OF THE SERIES OF ROCKS REPRESENTED BY THIS GENERAL SECTION AND IN PART BY THE PRECEDING LOCAL SECTIONS MAY BE MENTIONED FIRST THE GREATOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 53 NUNMBER OF THIN LAYERS AND BEDS AND SECONDLY TILE FREQUENT REPETITION OF SIMILAR BEDS AT VARIOUIS HORIZONS AGAIN THE ALMOST ENITIRE ABSENCE OF HEAVY MASSIVE STRATA OF LIMESTONE OR OTHER HARD MATERIAL POSSESSING SUFFICIENT DURABILITY TO FORM PERPENDICULAR ESCARPMENTS OF MUCH EXTENT IS WORTHY OF NOTE AS A GENERAL THING THE LIMESTONES VARY FROM ONLY A FEW INCHES IN THICKNLESS TO FROM ONE TO THREE OR FOUR FEET AND RARELY AS IN NOS 14 AND 18 ATTAIN A THICKNESS OF FROM THIRTYEIGHT TO FORTY FEET ALTHOUGH VARIOUS LIGHTCOLORED LAMI NATED CLAYS AND SOFT ARGILLACEOUS SHALY BEDS PREDOMINATE AND ARENACEOUS MATERIAL IS NOT UNFREQUENTLY PRESENT IT IS SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE THAT DARK BITUMINOUS SHALES AND BEDS OF COAL ARE RARELY MET WITH EVEN AMONIG THE OUTCROPS SEEN ALONG THE KANSAS BELOW THE MOUTH OF BLUE RIVER BELOLNGING TO THE UPPER COAL MEASURES AND HOLDING A POSITION BELOW THE BASE OF THE FOREGOING GENERAL SECTION WHILE THROUGH A CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS OF BEDS BELONGING TO HIGHER PORTIONS OF THE COAL MEASURES INCLUDED IN THE LOWER PART OF THIS SECTION AS WELL AS THROUGH THE STRATA CONTAINING PERMIAN FOSSILS ABOVE BEDS OF COAL ANLD DARK CARBONACEOUS SHALES APPEAR TO BE ALMOST IF NOT ENTIRELY WANTING IT WILL BE OBSERVED WE HAVE IN THIS GENERAL SECTION WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO DRAW LINES BETWEEN THE SYSTEMS OR GREAT PRIMARY DIVISIONS PRESENTED IN REGULAR SUCCESSION TLHE VARIOUS BEDS WITH THE FOSSILS FOUND IN EACH FROM THE CRETACEOUS SANDSTONE ON THE SUMMITS OF THE SMOKY HLILLS DOWN THROUGH SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET OF INTERMEDIATE DOUBTFUL STRATA SO AS TO INCLUDE THE BEDS CONTAINING PERMIAN TYPES OF FOSSILS AND A CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS OF ROCKS IN WHICH WE FIND GREAT NUMBERS OF UPPER COAL MEASURE FORMS WE HAVE PREFERRED TO GIVE THE SECTION IN THIS FORM BECAUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE THE UPPER COAL MEASURES OF THIS REGION PASS BY SUCH IMPERCEPTIBLE GRADATIONS INTO THE PERMIAN ABOVE THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WITH OUR PRESENT INFORMATION AT WHAT PARTICULAR HORIZON WE SHOULD DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN THEM WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO DEFINE THE LIMITS BETWEEN THE PERMIAN AND BEDS ABOVE IN WHICH WE FOUND NO FOSSILS BEEGINNING NEAR THE BASE OF THIS SECTION WE FIND WE HAVE IN GREAT NUMBERS THE FOLLOWINGY WELLKNLOWN AND WIDELY DISTRIBUTED COAL MEASURE FOSSILS VIZ FASULINA CYLINDRICA CHO RETES VEUNTETTILITNA PRODUCTUS SPLENLDENS OR A CLOSELY ALLIED SPECIES RETZIA ORMONII RHYNI CLHOELLA UTA SPIRIYERT SABTILITA SLPIRIFER CARNERATUS S PLANOCONREXA AND A EUONMPHALUS SIMILAR TO E 7RUGASTSI OF THE COAL MEASURES WHILE THE FEW NIEW AND UNDETERMINED SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ARE FOR THE MOST PART ALSO DECIDEDLY MORE NEARLY ALLIED TO CARBONI FEROUS THAN PERMIAN FORMS WE SHOULD HERE REMARK HOWEVER THAT WE OCCASIONALLY MET WITH A SPECIES OF MLOLNOTIS ALLIED TO THE PERMIAN SPECIES AL SPELUNCARIA AND SYNIOCLADIA BISERIALIS ALSO REGARDED IN TLHE OLD WORLD AS A PERMIAN GENUS AT HORIZONS FAR BENEATH THE  IN RUSSIA FUSTLIDIA CYLINDRICA IS SAID TO OCCUR ONLY IN THE UPPER PART OF THE LOWER CARBONIFEROUS SERIES BUT THE FOSSIL GENERALLY REFERRED TO THAT SPECIES IN THIS COUNTRY APPEARS TO BE CONFINED TO THE COAL MEASURES WE HAVE SOME DOUBTS IN REGARD TO ITS IDENTITY WITH THE RUSSIAN SPECIES54 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY BASE OF THIS SECTION BETWEEN MANHATTAN AND THE MISSOURI WE EVEN FOUND A SINGLE SPECIMEN OF THIS MIOOTIS AS LOW DOWN AS BED NO 9 OF THE SECTION TAKEN NEAR THE LAUDING AT LEAVENWORTH CITY WHICH IMAUST OCCUPY A POSITIOIN SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE LOWEST BEDS OF THE ABOVE SECTION STILL AS THIS SHELL IS VERY RARE IN THESE LOWER ROCKS AND THE SYNOCLADIA IS A DISTINCT SPECIES FROM THE WELLKNOWN PERMIAN FORM OF THE OLD WORLD WHLILE THEY ARE BOTH AT THESE HORIZONS ASSOCIATED WITH GREAT NUMBERS OF THE COMMON WELL KNOWN COAL MEASURE SPECIES WE CAN ONLY REGARD THEIR PRESENCE IN THESE BEDS AS ESTABLISHING THE EXISTENCE OF THESE GENERA AT AN EARLIER PERIOD IN THIS COUNTRY THAN IN THE OLD WORLD THIS IT SEEMS TO US IS MORE PHILOSOPHICAL THAN IT WOULD BE TO PLACE ALL THIS GREAT THICKNIESS OF STRATA WITH THEIR VAST NUMBERS OF WELLKNOWN COAL MEASURE SPECIES IN THE PERMIAN MERELY BECAUSE WE ALSO FIND WITH THESE OCCASIONALLY A FEW FORMS WHICH WOULD IN THE OLD WORLD BE REGARDED AS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PERMIAN EPOCH TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THEN THAT WE HAVE CARRIED THIS SECTION DOWN FAR ENOUGH TO INCLUDE LNOT ONLY ALL THE BEDS CONTAINING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY PERMIAN FORMS BUT A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE UPPER COAL MEASURES IT WILL BE INTERESTINOG TO NOTICE AS WE ASCEND IN THE SERIES HOW FAR EACH OF THE COAL MEASURE SPECIES MENTIONED IN THE LOWER PART OF THE SECTIONL AS WELL AS OF A FEW OTHERS THAT OCCUR ABOVE AND BELOW RANGE UPWARDS THUS WE SEE THAT IUSULINA CYLINDLRICA VAR VENTRICOSA CLIONETES TERNETTEIUANA AND REIZIA JLLORMIONII WERE NIOT MET WITH ABOVE DIVISION NO 37 WHILE SPIRFER PL7AIOCONVEXA PRODATCTWS SPLENDEAS8 AND RLIYNCAONELLA UTA WERE NOT OBSERVED ABOVE 34 NOR ASIR IFER CARNERATTS ABOVE 32 FUSUTLINA CYLINDRICA OF THE SLENDER VARIETY SO COMMON IN THE COAL MEASURES OF KANSAS AND MISSOURI WAS NOT SEEN ABOVE 22 NOR WAS ANY SPECIES OR VARIETY OF THAT GENUS OBSERVED ABOVE THIS HORIZON APPARENTLY THE SAME SPECIES OF MLONOTIS MENTIONED AT VARIOUS HORIZONS FAR BENEATH WERE OCCASIONALLY MET WITLH IN 30 25 23 AND 20 GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME SPECIES OF SYNOCLALIA RANGING FAR DOWN INTO THE UPPER COAL MEASURES IN DIVISION NO 19 WE AGAIN MET WITH THE OSYNOCLACLIA BISERIALIS AND A 5PIRIGERA ALLIED TO S SULTILITA IF NOT IDENITICAL ALONIG WITH A NEW SPECIES OF CLJONETES WE HAVE CALLED C MUCRONATA WHICH RANGES DOWN INTO THE BEDS NEAR THE BASE OF THE SECTION ALONG WITH THESE WERE ALSO PRODUCTUS 1IVBR WOODII AND ORTHISINA SHUMARDIANA BOTH OF WHICH ARE COMMON INL THE COAL MEASURES FAR BELOW AND A LARGE ORTHIISIHA SIMILAR TO 0 QTUNBWACULUM BUT APPARENTLY MORE FINELY STRIATE ASCENDINIG THROUGH THE INITERMEDIATE BEDS TO NO 12 WE CONTINUE TO MEET WITH NEARLY ALL THE SPECIES MENTIONED IN 19 WITH THC EXCEPTION OF CHONETES NMACRONATA WE ALSO HAVE FIRST IN 18 A LARGE SPECIES OF PRODUCTUS CALLED P ATLHOUNIANUS BY PROFESSOR SWALLOW VERY SIMILAR TO SOME VARIETIES OF P S8E IRETICULATUTS BUT THOUGHT BY PROF S TO PRESENT WELL MARKED INTERNAL DIFFERENCES THERE IS LIKEWISE ADDED IN 16 A LARGE ALLORISMNA AND A SPIRIIGER SIMILAR TO FIT SUBTILILA BUT UCHAMOREKGIBBOUS AND IN 14 DISCINA TENUINEATUSOF THE TJPPER MISSOURI 55 TOGETHER WITH APPARENTLY THE SAME MLONOTIS SO OFTEN MENTIONED BELOW IN 12 WE ALSO HAVE ADDED A SMALL SPIRFER SIMILAR TO S LINEATLUS BUT PERHAPS MORE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE PERMIAN SPECIES MARTINIA CLANNYANT KING THE SUCCEEDING BED ABOVE NO 11 APPEARS ALSO TO CONTAIN A MINGLING OF PERMIAN WITH COAL MEASURE FORMS FOR WE HAVE IN IT THE FOLLOWING PERMIAN TYPES VIZ MVYALINA VERY SIMILAR TO M SQUAMOSA PLEUROPHORUS S8DBCUNEATA BAKOEVELLIA PARVA AND MTIOIOTIS HAVWNI ALONG WITH A FUOMPHALUS NEAR F RUQOSSUS THE SAME GIBBOUS SPIRIGERA SIMILAR TO S SUB TULITA ORTHISINAT UMBRACULMTN AND 0 SLTTMARDIANA ON PASSING INTO THE NEXT DIVISION ABOVE NO 10 WE FIND WE HAVE LOST SIGHT OF ALL THE CHARACTERISTIC CARBONIFEROUS FORMS UNLESS THE SPIRIGERA MENTIONEDD IN SOME OF THE BEDS BELOW BE REGARDED AS ONLY A VARIETY OF S SUBTILITA FROM WHICH HOWEVER WE THINK IT SPECIFICALLY DISTINCT FOR WITH THIS EXCEPTION NEARLY ALL THE FOSSILS SEEN BY US IN THIS DIVI SION ARE SUCH AS WOULD BE REGARDED AS PERMIAN TYPES ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF SPECIES FOUND BY US IN NO 10 IS NOT GREAT INDIVIDUAL SPECIMENS ARE OFTEN NUMEROUS ABOVTE THIS HORIZON WE SAW NO MORE FOSSILS THROUGH A GREAT THICKNESS OF VARIOUS COLORED CLAYS CLAY STONES C UNTIL ASCENDING TO THE CRETACEOUS SANDSTONES CROWNING THE SMOKY HILLS IF WE DO NOT ADMIT THE EXISTENCE IN THIS REGION OF AN INTERMEDIATE GROUP OF ROCKS CON NECTING BY SLIGHT GRADATIONS THE PERMIAN ABOVE WITH THE COAL MEASURES BELOW AND MUST DRAW A LINE SOMEWHERE BELOW WHICH ALL IS TO BE REGARDED AS CARBONIFEROUS AND ALL ABOVE AS PERMIAN WE SHOULD CERTAINLY UPON PALHEONTOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES ALONE CARRY THIS LINE UP AS FAR AS THE TOP OF DIVISION NO 11 THE PASSAGE FROM THE CARBONIFEROUS TO THE STRATA CONTAINING PERMIAN TYPES HOWEVER IS SO GRADUAL HERE THAT IT SEEMS TO US NO ONE UNDER TAKING TO CLASSIFY THESE ROCKS WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLASSIFICATION ADOPTED IN THE OLD WORLD WOULD HAVE SEPARATED THEM INTO DISTINCT SYSTEMS EITHER UPON LITHOLOGICAL OR PALHEONTOLOGICAL GROUNDS ESPECIALLY AS THEY ARE NOT SO FAR AS OUR KNOWLEDGE EXTENDS SEPA RATED BY ANY DISCORDANCE OF STRATIFICATION OR OTHER PHYSICAL BREAK INDEED THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE PERMIAN TYPES OCCURRING IN NO 10 WERE FIRST INTRODUCED IN BEDS BELOW THIS CONTAINING MANY CARBONIFEROUS SPECIES WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT EVEN NO 10 MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED JUST BEFORE THE CLOSE OF A PERIOD OF TRANSITION FROM THE CONDI TIONS OF THE CARBONIFEROUS TO THOSE OF THE PERMIAN EPOCH THE APPARENT ABSENCE OF FOSSILS IN THE BEDS ABOVE NO 10 RENDERS IT IMPOSSIBLE WITH OUR PRESENT INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY THE UPPER LIMITS OF THE SERIES CONTAIN  WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY DR J G NORWOOD FORMER STATE GEOLOGIST OF ILLINOIS THAT THE ROCKS IN THAT STATE REFERRED BY HIM AND OTHERS TO THE SAME EPOCH AS THE KANSAS PERMIAN BEDS REST UNCONFORMABLY UPON THE COAL MEASURES THIS HOWEVER WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IN KANSAS SINCE NO DISTURBANCES OF THE STRATA OCCURRED THERE UNTIL AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE CRETACEOUS ERA WHICH WOULD OF COURSE NOT ONLY CAUSE THE CRETACEOUS AND CARBONIFEROUS BUT ALL INTERMEDIATE BEDS TO DIP AT THE SAME ANGLE56 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY ING PERMIANI FORMS IT IS TRUE THERE IS AT PLACES A KIND OF CONGLOMERATED MASS OCCUIPYING THE HORIZON NO 9 WHICH MIGHT APPEAR TO FORM A NATURAL LINLE OF DIVISIOLN BETWVEEN THE BEDS CONTAINING THE PERMIAN FOSSILS AND THOSE ABOVE IN WHICH WE FOUND NO ORGANIC REMAINS BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE LOCAL AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS A NEW FEATURE PRESENLTED BY THE ZONE OF GYPSUM DEPOSITS ABOVE IT WE FIND BETWEEN THE BEDS AND LAYERS OF GYPSUM AND FAR ABOVE THE HORIZON AT WHICH THEY OCCUR BLUISH GREENISH AND OTHER COLORED CLAYS NOT ONLY SIMILAR TO THOSE BETWEEN THE BEDS AND LAYERS OF LIMESTONE CONTAINING THE PERMIAN FOSSILS IN DIVI SION NO 10 BUT ALSO PRECISELY LIKE THE LAMINATED CLAYS BETWEEN THE BEDS OF LIMESTONE OF THE UPPER CARBONIFEROUS SERIES FAR BELOW AGAINI IN THESE CLAYS OF THE GYPSUM ZONE AS WELL AS THROUGH A CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS OF CLAYS ABOVE IT THERE ARE OCCASIONAL SEARNS OF CLAYSTONE WHICH SOMETIMES PASS INTO SEAMS OF MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE EXACTLY LIKE SOME OF THOSE CONTAINING PERMIAN FOSSILS IN DIVISION NO 10 WE SAW LNO FOSSILS IN THESE SEAMS AMONGST THE GYPSUMBEARING BEDS NOR HIGHER IN THE SERIES BUT IT IS PROBABLE THEY NMAY YET BE FOUND IN SOME OF THE MORE CALCAREOUS PORTIONS ANOTHER FACT APPARENTLY INDICATING SOME KIND OF RELATION BETWEEN THE GYPSUMBEARING BEDS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE HIGHER DEPOSITS ANID THE ROCKS BELOW IS THAT WE OFTEN FIND BOTH IN THE CLAYS BETWEEN THE BEDS OF GYPSUM AND THOSE BETWEEN THE LIMESTONE CONTAILLINGT THE PERMIAN FOSSILS THE SAME PECULIAR APPEARANCE CAUSED BY THE CRACKING OF THE CLAYS AND SUBSEQUENT INFILTRATION OF CALCAREOUS MATTER SEEN IN DIVISION NO 5 AT SOME PLACES THE THIN PLATES OF LIMESTONE FORMED BY THE IMPURE CALCAREOUS MLLATTER FILLING THESE CRACKS MAY BE SEEN RAMIFYING THROUGH SOME RATHER THIN BEDS OF THESE CLAYS IN ALL DIRECTIONS SO AS TO CROSS AND INTERSECT EACH OTHER AT EVERY ANGLE WHERE BEDS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN EX POSED FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIMNE ALONG NEAR THE TOPS OF BLUFFS THE SOFTER CLAYS FILLING THE INTER STICES OFTEN WEATHER OUT SO AS TO HAVE A CURIOUS CELLULAR MASS WITH THE LNUMNEROUS ANGTULAR CAVITIES FROM THESE FACTS WE ARE INCLINED TO SUSPECTTHOUGH WE ARE FULLLY AWARE THAT IT IS A QUESTIONI WHICH CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED UPON EVIDENCE DERIVED FROM ORGANIC REMAINSTHAT NOT ONLY THE GYPSUMBEARING DEPOSITS BUT A LARGE PORTION IF NOT ALL OF DIVISION NO 5 BELONGS TO THE SAME EPOCH AS THE BEDS CONTAINING THE PERMIAN FOSSILS BELOW BETWEEN NO 5 AND THE CRETACEOUS ABOVE THERE IS STILL A RATHER EXTENSIVE SERIES OF BEDS IN WHICH WE FOUND NO ORGANIC REMAINS THESE MAY BE JURASSIC OR TRIASSIC OR BOTH THOUGH AS WE HAVE ELSEWHERE SUGGESTED WE RATHER INCLINE TO THE OPINION THAT THEY MAY PROVE TO BELONG TO THE FORMER AS WE HAVE FULLY DISCUSSED THE QUESTION IN REGARD TO THE CRETACE OUS AGE OF THE HIGLHEST DIVISION OF THE FOREGOING SECTION IN A PAPER READ BEFORE THE ACADEMY IN DECEMBER LAST AND IN AN ARTICLE IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE JANUARY 1859 IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR US TO ADD ANYTHING FURTHER ON THAT SUBJECT HERE AS ALREADY STATED OUR OBOSCRVATIONS ALONG THE KANSAS VALLEY TO WITHIN TWELVE OR FOUROF THE UPPER MISSOURI 57 TEEN MILES OF THE MOUTH OF THE BIG BLUE RIVER WERE TOO ISOLATED TO DETERMINIE IN ALL CASES THE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUTCROPS SEEN AT DIFFERENT PLACES CONSEQUENTLY ALTHOUGH WE SAW AT SEVERAL POINTS ALONG THIS PART OF THE VALLEY INDICATIONS OF A WESTWARD OR NORTHWESTWARD INCLINATION OF THE STRATA WE WERE LEFT IN SOME DOUBT WLHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A GENERAL IN CLINATION OF THE ROCKS IN THAT DIRECTION BETWEEN WABOUNSE AND TLHE MISSOURI ABOVE THIS POINT HOWEVER OUR OBSERVATIONS BEINLG MORE CONNECTED AND THE EXPOSURES MORE CONTINUOUS WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE VERY SATISFACTORILY THAT THERE IS AT LEAST FROM NEAR WABOUNSE A UNIFORM DIP TOWARDS THE WEST OR NORTHWEST SO THAT IN ASCENDING THE KANSAS VALLEY FROM THIS REGION WE ARE CONSTANTLY MEETING WITH MORE AND MORE MODERN ROCKS AS THOSE WE LEAVE BEHIND PASS BENEATH THE LEVEL OF THE KANSAS TO ILLUSTRATE THIS MORE CLEARLY WE WOULD IN THE FIRST PLACE REMARK THAT A BED OF LIGHT GRAYISH YELLOW GRANULAR MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE OCCUPYING A HORIZON ABOUT 115 FEET ABOVE THE KANSAS TWO OR THREE MILES WEST OF ZEANDALE PASSES BENEATH THE LEVEL OF THE KANSAS BEFORE REACHING THE MOUTH OF THE BIG BLUE RIVER A DISTANCE OF NEAR SEVEN MILES WHILE ANOTHER BED NO 26 OF THE FOREGOING SECTION SEEN ON THE VERY SUMMIT OF THE HILLS TWO OR THREE MILES NLORTH OF ZEANDALE AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT 320 FEET ABOVE THE KANSAS WAS OBSERVED OPPOSITE MANHATTAN AT THE MOUTH OF BIG BLUE RIVER ONLY SOME 214 FEET ABOVE THE KANSAS AGAIN BED NO 12 OF THE FOREGOING GENERAL SECTION WHICH WAS SEEN AT A LOCALITY NEARLY OPPOSITE OGDEN AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT 363 FEET ABOVE THE KANSAS IS AT FORT RILEY EIGHT OR NINE MILES FURTHER WEST ELEVATED ONLY SOME 215 FEET ABOVE THE KANSAS ABOVE FORT RILEY THIS BED FORMS A MARKED HORIZON AND CAN BE FOLLOWED BY THE EYE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FOR SEVERAL MILES ALONG THE HILLS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER WE OBSERVED IT GRADUALLY SINKINOG AS WE ASCENDED THE KANSAS VALLEY UNTIL AT A POINT ON CHAPMANS CREEK SOME FIFTEEN MILES A LITTLE SOUTH OF WEST FROM FORT RILEY WE SAW IT NEARLY DOWN ON1 A LEVEL WITH THE KANSAS BEYOND THIS IT WAS NOT AGAIN MET WITH ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE KANSAS BUT WE SAW IT AT SOMEWHAT HIGHER ELEVATIONS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE RIVER A LITTLE WEST OF THIS AS THE DISTANCE BY AN AIRLINE FROM THE LOCALITY NLEARLY OPPOSITE OGDEN WHERE THIS ROCK OCCUPIES A HORIZON AT AN ELEVATION OF 363 FEET ABOVE THE KANSAS TO THE MOUTH OF CHAP MANS CREEK IS ABOUT 23 MILES THE DIP WOULD APPEAR TO BE NOT FAR FROM 1512 FEET TO THE MILE IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOWEVER THAT THE AVERAGE FALL OF THE KANSASAT LEAST BELOW FORT RILEYACCORDING TO THE BAROMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS OF COL FREMONT AND OTHERS IS NEAR ONE AND A HALF FEET TO THE MILE AND THAT IF WE ASSUME THE DISTANCE BY THE WINDINGS OF THE RIVER BETWEEN CHAPMANS CREEK AND OGDEN TO BE ABOUT THIRTY MILES IT WOULD MAKE THE ELEVATION OF THE KANSAS AT THE FORMER LOCALITY SOME FORTYFIVE FEET GREATER THAN AT OGDEN WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE DIP TO A FRACTION LESS THAN 14 FEET TO THE MILE STILL AS THE DIRECTIONI OF THE DIP IN THIS REGION IS TO THE VORTH OF WEST AND THE DIRECTION OF THE VROLI XIR858 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY MOUTH OF CHAPMANS CREEK FROM OGDEN IS CONSIDERABLY SOULI OF WEST IT IS PROBABLE THE INCLINATION OF THE STRATA HERE IS GREATER THAN THE ABOVE FIGURES WOULD INDICATE AND THAT IT MAY NOT BE LESS THAN TWENTY FEET TO THE MILE IN A NORTHWEST DIRECTION FROM THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DIP OF THE STRATA TO THE NORTHWEST AND IN SOME SLIGHT DEGREE TO THE FALL OF THE KANSAS AND SMOKY LILL RIVERS THE WHOLE OF THE FOREGOING GENERAL SECTION BELOW NO 12 PASSES BENEATH THE LEVEL OF THE SMOKY HILL BETWEEN THE MOUTH OF BLUE RIVER AND CHAPMANS CREEK CONSE QUENTLY THE LIMESTONES OF THE SUCCEEDING BEDS ABOVE BEING THINNER AND LESS DURABLE THAN THOSE BELOW AND SEPARATED BY HEAVY BEDS OF CLAY WE FIND AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED THAT THE COUNTRY HERE IN THE REGION OF THE MOUTH OF CHAPMANS CREEK IS MUCH LOWER THAN AT FORT RILEY AND BELOW ON REACHING THE MOUTH OF SOLOMONS FORK WE FOUND THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY CHARACTERIZED BY LONG GENTLE GRASSY SLOPES NLO PART OF IT NEAR THE RIVER BEING APPARENTLY ELEVATED MORE THAN ABOUT 60 OR 70 FEET ABOVE ITS SURFACE A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND THIS WE CAUGHT THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE SMOKY HILLS WHICH WERE SEEN IN A DIRECTION A LITTLE SOUTH OF WVEST FROM US RISING ABOVE THE SURROUNDING LOW COUNTRY LIKE DARK BLUE CLOUDS ABOVE THE HORIZON ON APPROACHING THESE WE FOUND THEM ALWAYS SITUATED SEVERAL MILES BACK FROM THE RIVER AND RISING SOME THREE HUNIDRED AND FIFTY FEET ABOVE IT THE IMMEDIATE BLUFFS OF THE RIVER HERE ARE GENERALLY COMPOSED OF DIVISIONS NO 4 AND 5 OF THE FOREGOING GENERAL SECTION AND THAT PORTION OF THESE HILLS ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SUMMITS OF THE BLUFFS ALONG THE RIVER IS MADE UP OF DIVISION NOS 3 2 1 OF THE SAME SECTION OLN THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE RIVER THESE HILLS HAVE BUT A COMPARATIVELY THIN CAPPING OF THE SANDSTONE NO 1 BUT ON THE NORTH SIDE WE SAW IT SHOWING A THICKENING ON SOME OF THEM OF SIXTY FEET FROM SOME OF THESE HILLS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF SMOKY HILL RIVER BETWEEN IT AND THE GRAND SALINE WE HAD AN EXTENSIVE AND BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY IN THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST MANY SIMILAR HILLS WERE IN SIGHT AND AS THE DIP OF THE STRATA HERE IS IN THAT DIRECTION IT IS PROBABLE SOME OF THEM ARE NOT ONLY CHIEFLY MADE UP OF THE SAND STONE NO 1 BUT SURMOUNTED BY THE OTHER CRETACEOUS BEDS NOS 2 AND 3 OF THE NEBRASKA CRETACEOUS SERIES INDEED MR ENGLEMAN FOUND ALL THESE FORMATIONS OCCUPYING THIS RELATION ON REPUBLICAN RIVER NLOT MORE THAN SEVENTY MILES NORTH OF THIS ALTHOUGH THIS PAPER IS MERELY DESIGNED TO GIVE A BRIEF SKETCLH OF THE LEADING GEOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THOSE PORTIONS OF NORTHEASTERN KANSAS VISITED BY US WE CANNOT CLOSE IT WITLHOUT ALLUDING TO THE TRULY GREAT AGRICULTURAL AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES OF THIS NEW AND INTE RESTING TERRITORY WE MEAN NO DISPARAGEMENT TO OTHER PORTIONS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WHEN WE STATE THAT AFTER HAVING TRAVELLED EXTENSIVELY IN THE GREAT WEST AND AFTER HAVING  SEE REPORT OF SECRETARY OF WAR DEC 5TH 1857 PAGC 497OF THE UPPER MISSOURT 59 SEEN MANY OF ITS MLOST FAVORED SPOTS WE HAVE MET WITH NO COUNTRY COMBINING MORE ATTRAC TIVE FEATURES THAN KANSAS TERRITORY HER GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION GIVES HER A COMPARATIVELY MILD AND GENIAL CLIMATE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF HEAT AND COLD WHILE THE RICH VIRGIN SOIL OF LHER BEAUTIFUL PRAIRIES IS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO THE GROWTH OF ALL THE GREAT STAPLE GRAIN AND ROOT CROPS OF THE WEST IT IS TRUE THAT IN SOME DISTRICTS THERE IS RATHER A DEFICIENCY OF TIMBER BUT AS A GENERAL THING THERE IS ALONG THE STREAMS SUFFICIENT FOR THE IMMEDIATE WANTS OF THE COUNTRY IN ADDITION TO THIS THE WONDERFUL RAPIDITY WITH WHICH FORESTS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE SPRUNG UP ON SIMILAR PRAIRIE LANDS IN MISSOURI AS THE COUNTRY BECAME SETTLED SO AS TO KEEP OUT THE ANNUAL FIRES SHOWS THAT THE PRESENT SCARCITY OF TIMBER SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS PRESELNTING ANY SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE PRAIRIE DISTRICT IN KANSAS BEFORE GOING OUT INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE TERRITORY WE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND THE WHOLE COUNTRY IMMEDIATELY WEST OF FORT RILEY COMNPARATIVELY STERILE ON THE CONTRARY HOWEVER WE WERE AGREEABLY DISAPPOINTED AT MEETING WITH SCARCELY ANY INDICATIONS OF DECREASING FERTILITY AS FAR AS OUR TRAVELS EXTENDED WHICH WAS ABOUT SIXTY MILES WEST OF FORT RILEY HERE WE FOUND THE PRAIRIES CLOTHED WITLH A LUXURIANT GROWTH OF GRASS AND LITERALLY ALIVE WITLH VAST HERDS OF BUFFALO THAT WERE SEEN QUIETLY GRAZING AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH IN EVERY DIRECTION EVEN ON THE HIGH DIVIDE BETWEEN THE SMOKY HILL AND ARKANSAS RIVERS SOUTH OF THIS WE FOUND THE SOIL RICH AND SUPPORTING A DENSE GROWTH OF GRASS AND FROM ALL WE COULD LEARN FROM PERSONS WHO HAVE GONE FURTHER OUT THE SAME KIND OF COUNTRY EXTENDS FOR A LONG DISTANCE BEYOND THIS TOWARDS THE WEST HENCE WE INFER THAT THE BELT OF UN PRODUCTIVE LANDS BETWEEN THE RICH COUNTRY ON THE EAST AND THE EASTERN BASE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS ON THE WEST IS MUCH NARROWER THAN IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED AND EVEN THIS SO CALLED DESERT COUNTRY IS KNOWN TO POSSESS A GOOD SOIL WHICH MAY BE RENDERED FRUITFUL BY ARTIFICIAL IRRIGATION IN REGARD TO THE MINERAL RESOURCES OF KANSAS WE HAVE AT PRESENT ONLY TIME AND SPACE TO SAY A FEW WORDS AS ALREADY STATED COAL IS KNOWN TO EXIST THOUGH ITS EXTENT IS NOT YET FULLY DETERMINED AT SEVERAL LOCALITIES IN THE REGION OF LEAVENWORTH CITY WHILE THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS DISCOVERIES ALREADY MADE WARRANT THE CON CLUSION THAT THIS IMPORTANT AND USEFUL MINERAL ABOUNDS AT MANY LOCALITIES SOUTH OF THERE LIMESTONE SUITABLE FOR BUILDING PURPOSES AND THE PRODUCTION OF QUICKLIME EXISTS THROUGH OUT LARGE AREAS WHILE INEXHAUSTIBLE BEDS OF GYPSUM ARE KNOWN TO OCCUR AT SEVERAL PLACES NOT FAR WEST OF THE MOUTH OF SOLOMONS RIVER NEAR THIS PLACE WE LIKEWISE SAW IN THE LOWER CRETACEOUS ROCKS CROWNING THE SUMMITS OF THE SMOKY HILLS DEPOSITS OF IRON ORE BUT WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE IN THE LIMITED TIME AT OUR COMMAND WHETHER OR NOT IT EXISTS IN LARGE QUANTITIES OF THE DISCOVERIES OF GOLD IN THE MOUNTAINS ON THE WESTERN BORDERS OF KANSAS MUCH HAS60 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY BEEN SAID NOTHING HOWEVER BUT A THOROUGH GEOLOGICAL SURVEY BY AUTHORITY OF THE TERRI TORIAL OR STATE GOVERNIMENT FOR KVANSAS MUST SOON BE A STATE CAN LAY BEFORE THE PUBLIC SUCH FULL ACCURATE AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ON THESE SUBJECTS AS WILL BRINIG FROM THE OLDER STATES THE CAPITAL SKILL AND ENTERPRISE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THE GREAT LNATURAL RESOURCES OF THE COUNITRY LEAVING THE TERRITORY OF KANSAS WE FIND THAT THE SOUTHEASTERN PORTION OF NEBRASKA IS ULNDERLAID BY LIMESTONES OF THE UPPER COAL MEASURES ILAVING ALREADY DESCRIBED THESE ROCKS IN DETAIL AS THEY OCCUR IN NEBRASKA IN A PRECEDING CHAPTER I SHALL SIMPLY ALLUDE TO TLLEM HERE IN A GENERAL WAY THE TOWN OF DE SOTO IS THE HIGHLEST POINT KNIOWN ON THE MLISSOURI

THE RIVER AND ARE SUCCEEDED BY THE SANDSTONE OF CRETACEOUS FORMATION NO 1 BOTH THE FOSSILIFEROUS CONTENTS AND LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS OF THESE LIME STONES SHOWV THAT THEY FORM THE NORTHWESTERN CONTINUATION OF THE SERIES OF ROCKS WHICH SEEM TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO A GYREATER OR LESS EXTENT OVER IOWA IANSAS ILLINOIS INDIANA AMISSOURI OHIO ANLD PORTIONS OF PENNSYLVANIA LEAVIIG IDE SOTO THE CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTOILES DO NOT AOAIN APPEAR ALONG THE MISSOURI RIVER UNTIL WE REACH THE VICINITY OF THE MOUNTAINS WHERE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEY ARE REVEALED IN THE FORM OF OUTCROPPING BELTS AROUNCL THE MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS THOUGH NO EVIDENCE FROM ACTUAL OBSERVATION HAS YET BEEN PUIBLISHED TO THE WORLD SUSTAINING THE INFERENCE ASCENDING THE PLATTE RIVER WE FIND THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY FROM THE ELKHORN TO FORT LARAMIE IS OCCUPIED BY ROCKS OF CRETACEOUS AND TERTIARY AGE AND NOT UNTIL WE REACH THE LARAMIE MOUNLTAINS DO WE AGAIN MEET WITH THE CARBONI FEROUS LIMESTONES WHICH HERE FORM AN OUTCROPPING ZONE EXPOSED BY THE UPHEAVAL OF THE OLDER ROCKS IN THE BLACK HILLS WE AGAIN FIND THEM EXPOSED AROUND THE NUCLEUS OF ELEVA TION WVITH THE SAME FOSSILS AND LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS AS AT THE LARAMIE MOUNTAINS FROM THESE FACTS ANID THE ACCOUNTS OF EXPLORERS IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH THERE IS GOOD REASONI FOR THE INFERENCE THAT THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS ARE PROBABLY COEXTENSIVE WITH THE GREAT CENTRAL RANGE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THIS SUBJECT WILL BE AGAIN ALLUDED TO IN A SUBSEQUENT PORTION OF THIS REPORT THE FOLLOWING CATALOGUE EMBRACES ALL THE CARBONIFEROUS AND PER MIAN FOSSILS OBTAINED

THE SUMMITS OF THLE BLUFFS TEN MILES ABOVE IOWA CREEK AT DORIONIS LHILLS THERE IS A FINE SECTION OF THIS BED ABOUT EIGHTY FEET EXPOSED ABOVE THE WATERS EDGE CONTAINING ITS MOST ABUNDANT VOL XII1074 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY AND CHARACTERISTIC FOSSIL OSTREA CONGESTA FROM THERE IT CONTINUES TO BE THE PREDOMINANT FORMATION UNTIL WE REACH THE FOOT OF THE GREAT BEND WHEN IT PASSES BY A GENTLE DIP BENEATH THE WATERLEVEL OF THE MISSOURI IN MANY PLACES AS OPPOSITE THE MOUTH OF NIOBRARA RIVER IT IS SHOWN IN THE FORM OF A LONG SERIES OF PRECIPITOUS BLUFFS GIVING A PLEASING VARIETY TO THE GENERAL MONOTONY OF THE SCENERY THIS IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THIS FORMATION SEE FIG 10 FIG 10 RJD4 A A TLLE UPPER PORTIOIL OF THIS ROCK IS A YELLOWISH AND GRAY CALCAREOUS MARL VERY SOFT AND YIELDING SO THAT IT IS EASILY CUT UP INTO NUMEROUS RAVIIIES BY THE TEMPORARY STREAMS AND THUS THE BLUFFS ALONG THIS PART OF THE MISSOURI OFTEN PRESENT THE APPEARANCE OF A

SUFFERED DENUDATION PRIOR TO THE DEPOSITION OF NO 4 NOT MORE THAN TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET BEING EXPOSED ABOVE THE WATERLEVEL ABOUT TWENTY MILES ABOVE THIS POILNT A THICK LESS OF SIXTY OR SEVENTY FEET IS SEEN NEAR THE MOUTH OF WHITE RIVER I FOUND IN THIS BED A LARGE MASS OF CALCAREOUS SPAR SIX FEET IN LENGTH AND EIGHTEEN INCHES IN THICKNESS ALSO NODULES OF LIMESTONE FORMED OF CONCENTRIC COATS WHICH IS I THINK THE SAME DESCRIBED BY NICOLLET AS  CYLINDRICAL LIMESTONE RESEMBLING ARRAGONITE ALTHOUGH SO WELL DEVELOPED AND COVERING SO WIDE AN AREA ON THE MISSOURI THE MIDDLE AND UPPER PORTIONS AT LEAST OF THIS ROCK CAN NEVER BE MADE USEFUL FOR BUILDING PURPOSES QUITE SOFT AND FRIABLE IN PLACE WHEN DETACHED IT ABSORBS MOISTURE RAPIDLY AND CRUMBLES IN PIECES BEING A RICH CALCAREOUS MARL IT MAY BE USED AT SOME FUTURE TIME AS A FERTILIZER THE FOSSILS OF THIS FORMATION ALTHOUGH BELONGING TO FEW SPECIES SO FAR AS YET KNOWN ARE NUMEROUS IN INDIVIDUALS A SPECIES OF OYSTER 0 CONGESTA IS FOUND IN GREAT QUANTITIES THROUGHOUT THE BED AND IN LOCALITIES INOCERAMRUS PROBLERNATICUS IS ABUNDANT FISH REMAINS THOUGH CONSISTING MOSTLY OF SCALES AND OBSCURE FRAGMENTS ARE DISSEMINATED THROUGHOUT THE DEPOSIT SEVERAL SPECIES OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED AND DESCRIBED BY DR LEIDY NEAR FIRST CEDAR ISLAND A VERY SINGULAR BED MAKES ITS APPEARANCE SUPERIMPOSED ON NO 3 WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS PROBABLY FORMING AN UPPER MEMBER OF THIS FORMATION IT EXTENDS UP THE MISSOURI ABOUT EIGHTY MILES TO A POINT NEAR THE GREAT BEND LITHOLOGICALLY IT IS A DULL BLACK UNCTUOUS CLAY ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF ANY GRIT AND DOES NOT EFFERVESCE WITH AN ACID IT CONTAINS SOME CARBONACEOUS MATTER GREAT QUANTITIES OF SELENITE IN CRYSTALS IN THIN LAMINAR AND IN THICK RHOMBOIDAL MASSES IN A NUIMBER OF LOCALITIES I LNOTICED FISH REMAINS BUT NO OTHER ORGANIC BODIES IN SEVERAL PLACES THE CARBONACEOUS MATTER OF THIS BED HAS BEEN IGNITED PRODUCING HEAT ENOUGH TO GIVE TO THE SURROUNDING STRATA A BRICKRED COLOR AND THE SLABS OF CLAYS THUS AFFECTED BY THE HEAT GIVE A RINGING SOUND UNDER A BLOW OF THE HAMMER TEN MILES BELOW THE MOUTH OF WHITE RIVER THIS ROCK HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF HEAT FOR SEVERAL YARDS SO THAT THE SURROUNDING STRATA PRESENT AN APPEARANCE SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE BURNING OF THE LIGNITE BEDS ON THE YELLOWSTONE THE SUPERINCUMBENT BEDS HAVE FROM THIS CAUISE FALLEN IN SOME INSTANCES FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FEET BELOW THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION MR NICOLLET IN HIS INTERESTING REPORT ON THIS REGION EXAMINED THESE PHENOMENA WITH GREAT CARE AND I CANNOT DO BETTER TLLAN TO QUOTE HIS EXPLANATION OF THEM  THESE PSEUDOVOLCANIIC PHENOMENA MAY BE COMPARED WITH THOSE DESCRIBED AS OCCURRING IN OTHER PORTIONS OF THE GLOBE UNDER THE NAME OF TERRAINS ARDENS ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NIOT HERE ACCOMPANIED BY THE EMISSION OF FLAMES THEY ARE EVIDENTLY DUE TO THE DECOMPOSITION BY THE PERCOLATION OF ATMOSPHERIC WATERS TO THEM OF BEDS OF PYRITES WHICH REACTING ON THE COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS SUCH AS LIGNITES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES OF A VEGETABLE NATURE IN THEIR VICINITY GIVE RISE TO SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION76 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY WHILE FURTHER REACTIONSVELL UNDERSTOOD BY THE CHEMISTUPON THE LIME CONTAINED IN THE CLAY BED PRODUCE THE MASSES AND CRYSTALS OF SELENITE THAT ARE OBSERVED IN THE LOWER PORTION OF THIS INTERESTING DEPOSIT THIS IS THE THEORY WVHICH WITH SOME LITTLE CONFIDENCE WE HAVE FORMED OF THESE PSEUDOVOLCANOES ABOUT TWO MILES ABOVE THE MIIOUTH OF WHITE RIVER THE BURNT APPEARANIEE IS AGAIN VISIBLE IN THIS BED NEAR THIS LOCALITY THERE IS A SEAM FORMED OF AN ACCUMULATION OF SALINE MATTER A YELLOW SUBSTANCE LIKE SULPHUR SELENITE AND THE HIYDRATED PEROXIDE OF IRON THREE FEET IN THICKNESS THE WHOLE PRESENTING A VARIETY OF COLORS LARGE MASSES HAVE FALLEN DOWN AT THE BASE OF THE BLUFFS FORMATION NO 4 OF GENERAL SECTION THIS FORMATION IS GEOLOGICALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IN THE CRETACEOUS SYSTEM OF THE NORTHWEST NLOT ONLY FROM ITS THICKNESS AND ITS GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION BUT ALSO ON ACCOUNT OF ITS INFLUENCE ON THE AGRICULTURAL CAPACITIES OF THE COUNTRY IT IS ONLLY SECOND IN INTEREST TO THE SUCCEEDING BED IN NUMBER BEAUTY AND VARIETY OF ITS ORGANIC REMAINS COMMENC ING ABOUT TEN MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF JAMES RIVER WHERE IT IS SEEN ONLY IN THIN OUTLIERS CAPPING THE DISTANT HILLS AND BLUFFS IT CONTINUES GRADUALLY ASSLUMING A GREATER THICKNESS AS WE ASCEND THE MISSOURI UNTIL WE REACH THE GREAT BEND WHERE IT MONOPOLIZES THE WHOLE REGION GIVING TO THE COUNTRY UNDERLAID BY IT A MOST GLOOMY AND STERILE ASPECT AT THE GREAT BEND IT ATTAINS A THICKNESS OF TWO HUNDRED FEET AND CONTINUES TO OCCUPY THE COUN TRY BORDERING THE MISSOURI TO THE MOUTH OF GRAND RIVER WHERE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NORTHWESTERLY DIP OF THE STRATA IT PASSES GRADUALLY BENEATH THE WATERLEVEL OF THE RIVER THE GENERAL LITHOLOGRICAL CHARACTER OF THE FORMATION THE BOUNDARIES OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED ABOVE IS A DARK ASHCOLORED CLAY VARYING HOWEVER IN COLOR AND STRUCTURE IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES FROM THE GREAT BEND TO THE MOUTH OF THE SHYENNE RIVER IT SHOWS BTUT LITTLE OF ITS SHALY CLHARACTER ITS GENERAL STRATIFICATION IS HORIZONTAL BUT THE LAYERS ARE BROKEN INTO NUMEROUS IRREGULAR FRAGMENTS NOT UNFREQUENTLY THE LAYERS OF CLAY HIAVE A SEAM OF GRAY SAND BETWEEN TLHEM TIHIS BED CONTAINS GREAT QUANTITIES OF A WHITISH SALINLE SUBSTANLCET A YELLOW MATERIAL LIKE SULPHUR AND AN ABUNDANCE OF FERRUGINOUS MATTER WHICH  SINCE THIS REPORT WAS WRITTEN I THINK I HAVE OBTAINED GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THE BITUNMINOUS BED FORTMIS THE BASE OF NO 4 INSTEAD OF THE TOP OF NO 3 IN SEVERAL PLACES NEAR BIJOUX HILLS THE SURFACE OF THE NIARLY PORTION OF NO 3 EXHIBITS THE APPEARANCE OF EROSION TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT PRIOR TO THE DEPOSITION OF THE BITUNMINOUS CLAYS T THIS WHITE SUBSTANCE IS FOUND DISSEMLINATED TO A GREATER OR LESS EXTENT THROUGHOUT ALL THE CRETACEOUS AND TER TIARY BEDS OF THE NORTHWEST IT EFFLORESCES ON THE SURFACE OF THE HILLS OR BLUFFS GIVING THEM A SNOWWHITE APPEAR ANCE IT IMNPREGNATES THE WATER THAT ISSUES FROML OR FLOWS OVER THESE BEDS RENDERING IT EXCEEDINGLY DISAGREEABLE IN ITS TASTE AND PURGATIVE IN ITS EFFECTS IT SOMETIMNES COVERS

TWO DISTINCT DIVISIONIS OR BASINS EXHIBITING WELLMARKED LITHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES AND CONTAINING ORGANIC REMAINS PECULIAR TO EACH 1ST GREAT LIGNITE TERTIARY BASIN COMMENCING NEAR THE MOUITH OF CANNONBALL RIVER AND EXTENDING ALONG THE MISSOURI NEARLY TO THE MOUTH OF THE MUSSELSHELL A DISTANCE OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILES I HAVE TRACED THIS FORMATION UP THE YELLOWSTONE TO THE MOUTH OF BIG HORN RIVER A DISTANCE OF THREE HUNDRED MILES ITS LIMITS HAVE NOT BEEN ASCER TAINED WITH ACCURACY IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS 2D LES MATTVAISES TERRES OR TERTIARY BASIN OF WHITE RIVER WHICH WITH ITS OUTLIERS IN CLUDING THE SANDHILLS AND PLIOCENE BEDS OCCUPY AN AREA OF FROM FOUR HUNDRED TO FIVE HUN DRED MILES FROM EAST TO WEST AND FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED MILES FROM LNORTH TO SOUTH EXACT LIMITS NOT YET ASCERTAINED LST GREAT LIGNITE TERTIARY BASIN THIS GREAT BASIN OCCUPIES AN IMMENSE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA AND WHEN THOROUGHLY EXPLORED WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE FOUND THE LARGEST FRESHWATER DEPOSIT IN OUR COUNTRY INDEED THE WVIDE EXTENT OF COUNTRY WHICH IT UNDERLIES ITS INFLUENCE ON THE EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY THE CHARACTER AND ABUNDANCE OF ITS ORGANIC REMAINS RENDER IT A MATTER OF THE HIGHEST INTEREST TO DETERMINE ITS EXACT AGE AND ITS TRUE RELATION TO OTHER TERTIARY DEPOSITS IT HAS BEEN KNOWN SINCE THE TIME OF LEWIS AND CLARKE THAT A DEPOSIT CONTAINIING LIGNLITE C EXISTED ON THE UPPER MISSOURI REPORTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO US BY OTHER TRAVELLERS SINCE THAT TIME BUT NO DETAILS OF ITS LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS ILO COLLEC TION OF ITS FOSSILS OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DETERMINE ITS AGE OR EXTENT THE COLLECTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY SECURED BY THE WRITER FROM THIS GREAT DEPOSIT SHOW MOST CONCLUSIVELY THAT IT POSSESSES THE MIXED CHARACTER OF AN ESTUARY AND FRESHWATER FORMATION AND ITS FOSSIL FLORA INDICATCS ITS AGE TO BE PROBABLY OF THE MIOCELLE TERTIARY WE WILL NOW GIVE A FEW OF THE DETAILS OF ITS GEOLOGY TOGETHER WITH SOME VIEWS IN REGARD TO ITS ECONOMICAL VALUE TO THE COUNTRY IN ASCENDING THE MISSOURI RIVER WE MEET WITH OUTLIERS OF THIS DEPOSIT BETWEEN GRAND AND CANNONBALL RIVERS NEAR LAT 460 IN THE FORM OF DENUDED HILLS THESE ARE

FROM FORMATION NO 5 APPROXIMATE SO CLOSELY TO WELLKNOWN TER TIARY FORMS THAT I AM INCLINED TO CONSIDER IT A TRANSITION OR BED OF PASSAGE FROM THE CRETACEOUS TO THE TERTIARY EPOCH AT FORT CLARK WE HAVE A BED OF LIGNITE TWO FEET IN THICKNESS EXPOSED PRESENTING ITS USUAL CHARACTERS 1 FERRUGINOUS SANDSTONE 30 TO 40 FEET NEAR THE BASE OF THE SANDSTONE IS A SEAM EIGHTEEN INCHES IN THICK NESS COMPOSED OF SHELLMARL WITH FINE SPECIMENS OF PALUTDIALA ALELANIA CORBILA C THESE SHELLS ARE94 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY FEET DISTRIBUTED SOMEWHAT SPARINGLY THROUGHOUT THE BED OF SANDSTONE IT ALSO

AS OF A GOOD QUALITY I MEAN THAT IT CONTAINS A SMALL AMOUNT OF EARTHY MATERIAL BUT I HAVE NOT YET SEEN ANY OF IT THAT WOULD BE OF MUCH VALUE FOR ECONOMI CAL PURPOSES SPECIMENS FROM THIS LOCALITY AND FROM FORT BERTHOLD FORTY MILES ABOVE  I AM SATISFIED THAT SOME OF THE BEDS OF LIGNITE ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE YELLOWSTONE CAN BE USED FOR FUEL WHEN THE COUNTRY IS SUFFICIENTLY SETTLED TO INDUCE A DEMAND FOR IT THERE ARE SOME EXCELLENT BEDS OF LIGNITE ON THE NORTHOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 95 PRESENT THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS ON EXAMINATION CONTAIN NO BITUMEN SULBLAMINATED STRUCTURE COMPACT FRAGMENTS HAVE A SOMEWHAT CONCHOIDAL FRACTURE AND A JET SHINING BLACK COLOR ALMOST ALWAYS REVEAL THE VEGETABLE FIBRE IGNITES VERY SLOWLY BURNS WITH A LIGHT YELLOWISH FLAME AND EMITS A SULPHUROUS SMELL THROUGHOUT THE DENUDED PORTIONS OF THIS FORMATION GREAT QUANTITIES OF SILICIFIED WOOD ARE FOUND IN A FINE STATE OF PRESERVATION AND SO CLOSE IS THE RESEMBLANCE THAT IT MAY READILY BE MISTAKEN AT A DISTANCE FOR RECENT WOOD NEAR THE FOOT OF THE GREAT BENID OF THE MIS SOURI ABOVE FORT BERTHOLD I OBSERVED A SILICIFIED STUMP NEAR THE BASE OF THE BLUFF STANDILNG UPRIGHT THREE FEET IN DIAMETER WITH A CAVITY IN THE CENTRE 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND SO PERFECTLY IS THE ORIGINAL FIBRE PRESERVED THAT THE LAYERS OF GROWTH ARE AS DISTINCT AS IN THE STUMP OF A TREE JUST FELLED WITH THE AXE NEAR THE GREAT BEND THE SURFACE OF THE COUNTRY PRESENTS AN EXCEEDINGLY RUGGED APPEAR ANCE AND IS CALLED BY THE INDIANS AND TRADERS  LES MAUVAISES TERRES OR BAD LANDS THE BLUFFS HERE AFFORD FINE EXAMPLES OF THE SPONTANEOUS IGNITION OF THE LIGNITE BEDS BY WHICH THE SUPERINCUMBENT STRATA ARE FUSED OR HEATED TO VARIOUS DEGREES OF COMPACTNLESS SOMETIMES GIVING THE HILLS THE APPEARANCE OF AN ACCUMULATION OF FRAGMENTS OF BURNT BRICKS OFTENTIMES THE CLAYS AND SANDS CONTIGUOUS TO THE LIGNITE BEDS ARE FUSED SO AS TO EXHIBIT EVERY VARIETY OF CHARACTER FROM A NEARLY VITREOUS MASS TO A LIGHT VESICULAR LAVA WITH A SPECIFIC GRAVITY LESS THAN WATER MANY OF THESE LIGHT VESICULAR MASSES FALL DOWN TO THE EDGE OF THE RIVER AND THE CURRENT IN HIGH WATER CARRIES THEM DOWN SCATTERING THEM ON SANDBARS AND BOTTOMS EVEN BELOW ST LOUIS AND THUS THE ORIGIN OF THE OPINION THAT THERE WERE VOLCANIC PRODUCTS SOMEWHERE NEAR THE SOURCES OF THE MISSOURI SECTION OF STRATA AT CROW HILLS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES BELOW FORT UNION

LIGNITE 6 YELLOW AND YELLOWISH GRAY SANDSTONE WITH IRREGULAR SEAMS OF CLAY THIS BED CONTAINS MANY SPECIES OF SHELLS AND DISTINCT IMPRESSIONS OF A SPECIES OF FERN IN A BLACK COMPACT CLAY ROCK EXPOSED   30 ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING PORTIONS OF THE COUNTRY OCCUPIED BY THE LIGNITE DEPOSIT IS IN THE REGION SURROUNDING FORT UNION NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS GEOLOGICAL PECULIARITIES BUT ALSO FROM THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF ITS FOSSILS SCATTERED OVER THE DENUDED HILLS ON BOTH PLATTE 18 INCHES TO 2 FEET IN THICKNESS WHICH HAS BEEN USED WITH SUCCESS AT A MILITARY STATION NEAR IT IT WILL NOT HOWEVER SUPPLY SUFFICIENT HEAT FOR WELDING IRON96 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY SIDES OF THE MISSOURI RIVER ARE GREAT QUANTITIES OF THE SHELLS OF MOLLUSCA IN A FINE STATE OF PRESERVATION LOOKING VERY MUCH LIKE THOSE STREWN UPON THE SHORES OF OUR PRESENT RIVERS OR LAKES SILICIFIED WOOD OCCURS EVERYWHERE IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE IN THE SAME PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION BEFORE MENTIONED A VERTICAL

LEAVES OF THE SAME SPECIES WITH THOSE FOUND IN THE SAME BED TEN MILES BELOW THIS POINT AND HOLDING NEARLY THE SAME POSITION BUT OLLE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE FEATURES OF THIS BED AT THIS LOCALITY IS THE PRESENCE OF MYRIADS OF SPHERICAL CONCRETIONS COVERING AN AREA OF SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THEY VARY IN SIZE FROM HALF AN INCH TO SEVERAL FEET IN DIAMETER AND ARE FORMED OF THIII LAYERS OF SAND STONE

WIND OVER THE PLATEAUS SURROUNDINIG THESE HILLS AND ARE SOMETIMES CARRIED A MILE OR MORE FROM THE ORI GINAL POSITION EVEN AT THE PRESENT TIME I OBSERVED SEVERAL PLACES WHERE THE LIG1NITE BEDS WERE IN A STATE OF COMBUSTION BOTH ON THE MISSOURI AND ON THE YELLOWSTONE AND THE ATMOSPHERE IS FILLED WITH SMOKE ANID THE SULPHUROUS SMELL WHICH ISSUES FROM THESE FIRES IS EXCEEDINGLY OFFENSIVE TO THE

DESCRIBED BY DR RICHARDSON THE JETS OF SMOKE ISSUING IN MANY PLACES FROM THE PERPENDICULAR FACE OF THE CLAYEY CLIFFS PRESENTED A SINGULAR SPECTACLE THE COMBUSTION HAD IN MANY PLACES SCORCHED THE LAYERS OF UNCTUOUS EARTH THAT INTERSTRATIFY THE COAL FORMATION AND TURNED THEIR SURFACE TO A LIVELY RED COLOR IN REGARD TO THE AGE OF THE LIGNITE FORMATIONS DESCRIBED BY MR SIMPSON WE HAVE NO RELIABLE INFORMATION IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEY ARE SYNCHRONOUS WITH THOSE ON THE UPPER MISSOURI BUT SOME PORTION OF THEM MAY BELONG TO THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD WE WILL NOW RETURN TO THE MISSOURI RIVER AND TRACE THE LIGNITE STRATA WESTWARD INTO TLLE INTERIOR TOWARD THE BLACK HILLS ALONG THEIR SOUTHERN BOUNDARIES IN LATITUDE 4612  LONGITUDE 10021 NEAR THE MOUTH OF CAINONBALL RIVER WE HAVE DISTINCT INDICATIONS

MOUNTAINS THE BLACK HILLS AND THE SOURCES OF THE MISSOURI AND YELLOWSTONIE SO ABUN DANT IS THE DRIFT TOWARD THE SOURCES OF THESE RIVERS THAT IT CHANGES THEIR ENTIRE CHARACTER THE WATERS OF THE YELLOWSTONE AT ITS MOUTH ARE TURBID FLOWINIG OVER A BED OF MARLY CLAY LIKE THOSE OF THE MISSOURI FROM FORT UNION TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE MISSISSIPPI BUT ABOUT FIFTY MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE YELLOWSTONE SMOOTH WATERWORN PEBBLES BEGIN TO APPEAR SMALL IN SIZE AND FEW IN NUMBER AT FIRST BUT BECOMING LARGER AND INCREASING III QUANTITY AND WHEN WE REACH A POINT TWO HUNDRED MILES ABOVE ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE MISSOURI THEY COMPLETELY PAVE THE BED OF THE RIVER AND FORM THE GREATER PORTION OF THE MATERIALS WHICH COMPOSE THE RIVER BOTTOMS IN VERY LARGE AREAS TO THE DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET AND MORE FROM THIS FACT THE WATERS OF THE YELLOWSTONE GRADUALLY LOSE THEIR TURBID CHA RACTER AND NIEAR THE MOUNTAINS ARE CLEAR AS CRYSTAL THLE WATERS OF THE MISSOURI ALSO BE COME LESS OPAQUE AFTER PASSING

DIAMETER IT VARIES MUCH IN COLOR HOWEVER DEPELNDING UPON THE AMOULNT OF FERRUGINOUS MATTER CONTAINED IN IT IN THE SOUTHERN AND SOUTLLEASTERN PORTIONS OF KANSAS ANID NEBRASKA THIS DEPOSIT IS QUITE LARGELY DEVELOPED OFTEN COLNCEALING THE OLDER ROCKS OVER LARGE AREAS ACCORDING TO PROF SWALLOW IT IS SEEN THROUGHOUT THAT PORTION OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI BORDERING UPON THE RIVER BUT REACHES ITS HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT FROM THE IOWA LINE TO BOONEVILLE FROM THENCE TO ST LOUIS IT IS VERY THINLY REPRESENTED IT IS ALSO LARGELY DEVELOPED IN THOSE PORTIONS OF KANISAS NEBRASKA AND IOWA WHICH BORDER UPON THE MISSOURI RIVER BUT ATTAILNS ITS GREATEST THICKNESS BETWEENI COUNCIL BLUFFS ALND SIOUX CITY ON THE IOWA SIDE THERE IT IS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FEET IN THICKNESS FORMING A RANGE OF VERY PRECIPITOUS HILLS WHICH ARE SO STEEP THAT VEGETATION IS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY SUPPORTED ON THEIR SIDES AFTER PASSING THE BIG SIOUX THIS DEPOSIT BE GINS GRADUALLY TO THIN OUT UPON THE SUINMITS OF THE HILLS AND AFTER PASSING THE MOUTH OF THE NIOBRARA IT CANNOT BE SAID TO EXERT MUCH INFLUENCE ON THE SURFACE OF THE COUNTRY IT IS OBSERVED HOWEVER IN OUTLIERS EVEN TO THE NMOUNTAINS BOTH ALONG THE MISSOURI AND YELLOW STONE RIVERS IS QUITE CONSPICUOUS NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE JUDITH WITH A THICKNESS OF ONE HUNDRED FEET AND CONTAINING ITS PECULIAR FOSSILS WHEREVER IT OCCURS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE

NIOBRARA RIVERS AND PASSES IMPERCEPTIBLY DOWN INTO THE PLIOCENE GRITS WHICH HAVE REVEALED SO MANY EXTINCT MAMMALIAN REMAINS TLLAT A LARGE PORTION OF THIS FORMATION IS SYNCHRONOUS IN AGE WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS CHAPTER TERMED THE DRIFT DEPOSIT I HAVE NO DOUBT A GREAT THICKNESS OF WATERWORN PEBBLES OFTEN UNDERLIES THE YELLOW MARL AND THE TWO DEPOSITS SEEM OFTEN TO PASS INTO EACH OTHER BY ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE GRADATIONS IN DEED IN MANY PLACES THE DRIFT BEDS VARY VERY GREATLY IN THICKNESS AND AT OTHERS ALTERNATING WITH THE MARL PROVING QUITE CLEARLY THAT THERE IS A DISTINCT GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCE IN THE CHARACTER OF THE DEPOSIT RATHER THAN A DIFFERENCE OF AGE THE FOSSILS PECULIAR TO THE YELLOW MARL DEPOSIT ARE QUITE NUMEROUS IN SPECIES MINGLED WITH THE REMAINS OF MOST OF THE LIVING MAMMALS OF THE PLAINS ARE THOSE OF EXTINCT QUADRU PEDS AS 3ILASTODOUZ ELEP7THANT C WITH LARGE QUANTITIES OF FLUVIATILE AND TERRESTRIAL MOLLUSCS OF THE GENERA HELIX LIMNEA PHYSA PALUDINA PUBPA

MORE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED 3D ERRATIC BLOCK DEPOS8IT I HAVE GIVEN THIS NAME TO A SUPERFICIAL DEPOSIT OF ROCKS OR BOULDERS WHICH FORMS QUITE A CONSPICUOUS FEATURE IN MANY PORTIONS OF THE NORTHWEST IT IS FORMED OF NEARLY OR QUITE UNWVORN ROCKS FROM ALL THE FORMATIONS IN THAT COUNTRY BUT MORE ESPECIALLY FROM THE META MORPHIC AND PALHOZOIC SERIES THAT IT IS MORE RECENT THAN THE TWO DEPOSITS ALREADY ALLUDED TO IS EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT IT OVERLIES THEM BOTH WHEREVER THEY ARE EXPOSED IT SEEMS TO BE VERY SIMILAR IN ITS CHARACTER THOUGH ON A MUCLH SMALLER SCALE TO THAT OF THE  ERRATICS OF NEW ENGLAND BUT THE ROCKY MASSES ARE NOT USUALLY SO LARGE SELDOM EXCEEDING FOUR OR FIVE TONIS IN WEIGHT THESE ROCKS ARE FAR MORE NUMEROUS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE MISSOURI RIVER THINNING OUT AND BECOMING SMALLER IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION UNTIL THEY ENTIRELY DISAPPEAR BUT ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE RIVER IN DAKOTA AND MINNESOTA THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE COUNTRY MAY BE SAID TO BE COVERED TO A GREATER OR LESS EXTENT WVITH THESE ERRATIC BLOCKS THE HILLS THAT BORDER THE RIVER OPPOSITE FORT PIERRE ARE PAVED WITH THEM FOR MILES SO THAT A PERSON COULD STEP FROM BLOCK TO BLOCK SOMETIMES THEY FORM ZONES OR BELTS WTITH A SOUTHEASTERLY AND NORTHWESTERLY RANGE NEAR FORT PIERRE THESE BELTS ARE FROM HALF A MIIILE TO A MILE IN WIDTH ON THE SURFACE OF WHICH ARE SCATTERED VERY THICKLY THESE ANGULAR MASSES WHILE AN INTERVENING BELT OF LAND OCCURS WHOSE SURFACE IS NEARLY DESTITUTEOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 1LL OF ROCKS THIS EXCEEDINGLY CURIOUS FEATURE IN THE COUNTRY WAS OFTEN POINTED OUT TO ME AS A MYSTERY BY THE VOYAGERS AS WE ASCENDED AND DESCENDED THE RIVER THE SAME PHENO MENON OCCURS ON PRATTS CREEK ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES BELOW BIJOUX HILLS THOUGH ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE CONSISTING OF A SERIES OF LOCAL BELTS OF LAND EITHER ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OR WHOLLY COVERED WITH ANGULAR OR SLIGHTLY WORN ROCKS WE HAVE FIRST A BELT 15 OR 20 YARDS WIDE COVERED VERY THICKLY WITH ERRATIC BLOCKS SECOND AN INTERVAL OF 150 YARDS ALMOST FREE FROM ROCKS THIRD A BELT OF ROCKS SIMILAR TO THE FIRST AND SO CONTINUES FOR SEVERAL MILES THESE ALTERNATE BELTS OCCUPY A LARGE AREA IN THIS REGION HAVING A NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST RANGE AND SHOW CONCLUSIVELY THE SOURCE FROM WHENCE THESE ROCKS WERE DERIVED AS WELL AS THE AGENCY WVHICH TRANSPORTED THEM FROMN THEIR PARENT BED BIJOUX HILLS WHICH ARE FROM 500 TO 100 FEET HIGH ABOVE THE BED OF THE MISSOURI ARE COVERED WITH  ERRATICS MANY OF WHICH ARE MASSES OF LIMESTONE CONTAINING FOSSILS AS TRILOBITES CRINOIDS CORALS AND BRACIHIOPODA OF PALEOZOIC TYPES THE ABOVE FACTS SHOW CLEARLY THE GREAT INTEREST WHICH SURROUNDS THIS SUBJECT AND THAT IT IS WELL WORTHY OF A CAREFUL INVESTIGATION 4T7H BOTTOM PAIIRIE THE BROAD FERTILE BOTTOM PRAIRIES OF THE MISSOUIRI ARE INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE DIVISION OF THE SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS AND CONSTITUTE A MOST INTERESTING GEOLOGICAL FEATURE THESE BOTTOM PRAIRIES FORM BY FAR THE MOST FERTILE LANDS OF THE WEST THE VEGETABLE SOIL SOMETIMES EX TENDING DOWNWARDS TO THE DEPTH OFTWENTY OR THIRTY FEET AND COVERED WITH TALL SEDGE GRASS AND FLOWERING PLANTS WITH HERE AND THERE A GROVE OF GIGANTIC COTTONWOOD TREES THESE BOTTOM LANDS ARE QUITE EXTENSIVE ALONG THE MISSOURI FROM THE MOUTH OF THE KANSAS RIVER TO COUNCIL BLUFFS BUT ATTAIN THEIR GREATEST WIDTH BETWEEN COUNCIL BLUFFS AND SIOUX CITY ON THE IOWA SIDE OF THE RIVER THE BOTTOM SEEMS TO BE CONTINUOUS FOR ONE HUNDRED MILES VARYING IN WIDTH FROM FIVE TO THIRTY MILES THE VERMILION PRAIRIE COMMENCES AT THE MOUTH OF THE BIG SIOUX AND EXTENDS WITH VERY LITTLE INTERRUPTION TO DORIONS HILLS A DIS TANCE OF SIXTY MILES AND VARIES IN WIDTH FROM ONE TO EIGHT OR TEN MILES THE MATERIALS WHICH COMPOSE THE BOTTOM PRAIRIES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DERIVED TO A GREAT EXTENT FROM THE CALCAREOUS AND SILICIOUS MNARLS OF THE TERTIARY MINGLED WITH THE CLAYS OF THE CRETACEOUS STRATA OF THE UPPER MISSOURI AND THE SURFACE IS COVERED WITH A THICK VEGETABLE MOULD FROM THE ANNUAL DECAY OF AN ENORMOUS GROWTH OF VEGETATION 5TH ALLUVITUM THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ALLUVIUM AND BOTTOM PRAIRIE IS VERY MARKED ALL ALONOG THE MISSOURI RIVER IT IS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE LATTER AS RESTRICTED IN THE PREVIOUS DIVISION OF THE QUATERNARY DEPOSIT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FORMED BY ANY AGENCIES IN OPERATION AT THE11 2 ON TILE GEOLOGY ANI NATURATL HISTORY PRESENT DAY WHILE THE FORMER IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND EVEN FROM DAY TO DAY THE CHANNEL OF THE MISSOURI IS CONTINUALLY CHANGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE WEARING AWAY AND REMOVING ALLUVIUM BOTTOM PRAIRIE OR ANY OTHER FORMATION WITH WHICH THE CURRENT MNAY COME IN CONTACT THE MATERIALS ARE HELD IN SUSPENSION IN THE WATERS AND ARE CARRIED DOWN THE STREAM TO FORM SANLDBARS ISLANDS C MOST OF THE ISLANDS WHICH SO THICKLY DOT THE BED OF THE MISSOURI AND MUCH OF THE TIMBER PORTIONS ALONG THE SIDE OF THE RIVER ARE FORMED OF ALLUVIUM WHEN THE MAIN CURRENT OF THE WATER CHANGES FROM ONE SIDE OF THE BED TO THE OTHER A SANDBAR IS FORMED IMMEDIATELY A THICK GROVTH OF WVILLOWS SPRILNGS UP WHICH IS SOON SUCCEEDED BY COTTONIWOOD WHICH MAY BECOME A FINE FOREST BEFORE THE CURRENT BRINGS ITS ERODING POWER AGAIN TO BEAR UIPON IT NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE PLATTE THERE IS AN ISLAND CALLED PILOT ISLAND FORMED ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO BY THE WRECK OF A STEAMER ON A SANIDBAR THE LOOSE MATERIALS COMMENCED ACCUMULATING UPON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE BROKEN SHIP AND AT THE PRESENT TIME THE ISLANID COVERS AN AREA OF SEVERAL ACRES WITH A THICK GROWTH OF COTTONWOOD TREES FROM TWELVE TO TWENTY INCHES IN DIAMETER THE MISSOURI AS WELL AS ALL ITS TRIBUTARIES FURNIISH COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF THIS DEPOSIT BUT THE LANLD THUS FORMED IS SO SUBJECT TO REMOVAL THAT IT IS OF COMPARATIVELY LITTLE ECONOMICAL VALUE TO THE SETTLER FARTHER THAN TO FURNISH A MODERATE SUPPLY OF TIMBER THE DISADVANTAGES ARISING FROM THEIR WANT OF PERMANENCE ARE TOO XVELL KNOWN TO BE MENTIONIED IN THIS CONNECTION I HAVE THUS PRESENTED A MERE OUTLINE OF MY NOTES ON THE SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS OF THE NORTHWVEST WITH THE VIEW OF DEVELOPING THE SUBJECT MORE FULLY IN MY FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS SURFACE GEOLOGY HAS NOT YET RECEIVED THAT ATTENTION WHICH ITS IMPORTANCE DEMANDS AND IT SEEMS QULITE OBVIOUS THAT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORCES NOW IN OPERATION VILL BE FOUND TO BE OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE IN EXPLAINING THE GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA OF THE PAST RLIVER TERRACES SO WELL MARKED A FEATURE OF THE VALLEY OF THE MISSOURI AND ITS TRIBUTARIES AS THE RIVER TERRACES SHOULD NOT BE PASSED OVER IN THIS CONNECTION WITHOUIT A BRIEF NIOTICE I WILL NOT AT THIS TIME ATTEMPT TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR EXISTENCE BUT CONTENT MYSELF WITH STATING A FEW OF MY OBSERVATIONS ALL ALONG THE VALLEY OF THE MISSOURI RIVER FROM MOUTH TO SOURCE THESE TERRACES ARE MORE OR LESS CONSPICUOUS AND THEY ARE ALSO SEEN IN THE VALLEY OF EVERY IMPORTANT TRIBU TARY THESE PHENOMENA ARE NOT HOWEVER CONFINED TO THE NORTHWEST ALONE BUT ARE OB SERVED TO A GREATER OR LESS EXTENT ALL OVER THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE CONTINENT AND SUCH IS THEIR SIMILARITY OF CHARACTER THAT IT POINTS TO SOME UNIFORM CAUSE FOR THEIR EXISTENCE IN PROF DANAS GREAT WORK FORMING ONE OF THE REPORTS OF THE EXPLORING EXPEDITIOLL SERIES THE SUBJECT IS TREATED VERY FULLY FROM OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE AUTHOR ALONG THE WESTERNOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 113 SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MIOUNTAINS AND AS THEY ALL INDICATE THESE WESTERN SLOPE TERRACES TO BE LONG TO THE SAME GREAT SYSTEM THE REMARKS THAT WILL APPLY TO ONE PORTION OF THE COUNTRY WILL APPLY TO A GREATER OR LESS EXTENT TO ALL NEAR THE SOURCES OF THE LARGER STREAMS AS THEY FLOW FROM THE STEEP SIDES OF THE MOUN TAINS THESE TERRACES FORM A VERY CONSPICUOUS FEATURE OF THE VALLEYS THERE ARE USUALLY FROM THREE TO FOUR OF THEM FORMING QUITE NARROW BENCHES AND GRADUIALLY INCREASING IN WIDTH BUT DIMINISHING IN HEIGHT AS WE APPROACH THE MISSISSIPPI FOR EXAMPLE IN THE VALLEYS OF THE THREE FORKS OF THE MISSOURI THERE ARE THREE AND FOUR OF THCSE TERRACES ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIVERBED FIRST TERRACE NEAR THE CHANNEL OF THE RIVER THREE FEET ABOVE WATERLEVEL VARYING IN WIDTH FROMN A FEW FEET TO TEN OR TWENTY YARDS SECOID TERRACE TEN TO TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE BED OF THE RIVER FROM TEN TO FIFTY YARDS WIDE THIRL TERRACE THIRTY TO FIFTY FEET HIGH AND FROM TWENTY TO FORTY YARDS WIDE FOURTH TERRACE ONE HIUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET HIGH AND VARYING FROM ONE HUNDRED YARDS TO LHALF A MILE IN WIDTH AS WE DESCEND THE MISSOURI THE FOURTH TERRACE SEEMS TO BE XVANTING AND THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD TERRACES VARY GREATLY IN WIDTLH OFTEN FORMING BROAD LEVEL PLAINS NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE YELLOWSTONE THE FIRST TERRACE IS FROM THREE TO SIX FEET ABOVE THE WVATER AND IS ON A LEVEL WITLH THE ISLANDS AND SANDBANKS MOST OF THE TIMBER GROWS UPON THIS TERRACE THE SECOND TERRACE FORMS WHAT IS CALLED THE BOTTOM AND IS FIORO TEN TO FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT AND FROM A FEW YARDS TO HALF A MILE IN WIDTH AND THE THIRD TERRACE ASCENDS VERY GRADUALLY TO THE FOOT OF THE BLUFFS VARYING FROM ONE MILE TO FIVE MILES IN WIDTH AND TWENTY TO FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT UPON THIS TERRACE FORT UNION IS BUILT AND IT HAS NEVER YET BEEN KNOWN TO BE OVERFLOWED IT IS COVERED WITH A THICK DEPOSIT OF MARL ULNDERLAID WITH SMALL WATERWORLN PEBBLES GENERALLY TO THE DEPTH OF FROM TEN TO TWENTY FEET AND THEN WE COME TO THE TERTIARY BEDS THE FIRST AND SECOND TERRACES ARE IN MOST CASES COMPOSED EN TIRELY OF THE MORE RECENT SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS ALONG THE VALLEY OF THE BI SHYENNE AND NEAR THE BLACK HILLS WE AGAIN SEE THESE TERRACES FORMING VERY BROAD LEVEL BEAUTIFUL PLAINS NEAR THE MOUTH OF PLUM CREEK THE FIRST TERRACE IS A FINE GRASSY BENCH ABOUT FOUR FEET ABOVE THE BED OF THE STREAM AND THE SECOND TERRACE IS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FEET IN HEIGHT AND THE THIRD FORTY TO FIFTY FEET HIGH THIS LAST TERRACE IS COVERED WITH A THLICK DEPOSIT OF PEBBLESTONES SAND AND GRAVEL RESTING UPON CRETACEOUS FORMATION NO 4 WHICH IS THE PREVAILING ROCK OF THIS REGION NEAR FORT RANDALL THE FIRST TERRACE IS COMNPOSED OF FINE SAND CLAY AND PEBBLES SIX TO TEN FEET ABOVE THE RIVER SECOND TERRACE STRATIFIED SAND AND CLAY FROM TEN TO TWENTY FEET HIGH THIRD TERRACE IS COMPOSED MOSTLY OF DARK STRATIFIED IN DURATED CLAY WITH NUMEROUS SEAMS OF PEBBLESTONES IT IS EVIDENTLY DERIVED FROM THE ERODED MATERIALS OF CRETACEOUS FORMATION NO 4 AND AT ONE POINT FORMS A SERIES OF BLUFFS SIXTY FEET IN HEIGHT WORN INTO RAVINES LIKE BLUFFS ON A LARGER SCALE AS WE APPROACH THE SETTLED PORTIONS IN DESCENDING THE MISSOURI WE FIND THAT MOST OF THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES VOL XII15114 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY ARE LOCATED UPON THE THIRD TERRACE WHICH IS FAR ABOVE HIGH WATER MARK NEAR BELLEVUE AND OMAHA CITY WE HAVE VERY FINE EXAMPLES OF TERRACES AND THESE VILLAGES ARE LOCATED UPON THE THIRD IN A FORTHCOMING OFFICIAL REPORT I HOPE TO TREAT THIS SUBJECT IN DETAIL ILLUSTRATING IT WITH NUMEROUS OUTLINE SKETCHES WE REGARD THIS SUBJECT AS ONLE OF GREAT INTEREST AND MOST INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE HISTORY OF THE ELEVATION OF THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE CONTINENT FOR WE CAN HARDLY DOUBT THAT THE TERRACES RESULT FROM THE GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN RANGE CHAPTE R XIII RESUME OF TIIE GEOLOGY OF THE MISSOURI RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES IN THE FOLLOWING CHAPTER I DESIRE TO PRESENT A RESURME OF THE GEOLOGY OF THAT PORTION OF THE NORTHWEST UNDER CONSIDERATION WITH THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OBTAINED SINCE THE PRECEDING REPORT WAS WRITTEN THE FOREGOING CHAPTERS WITH VERY SLIGHT ALTERATIOLNS RE MAIN AS THEY WERE PREPARED OVER TWO YEARS SINCE INIASMUCH AS I HAVE NOT FELT AUTHORIZED TO MAKE ANY IMPORTANT CHANGES ON ACCOUNT OF MY RELATIONS TO A SUBSEQUENT EXPEDITION TO THE NORTHWEST UNDER THE COMMAND OF CAPTAIN WM F REYNOLDS T E A REPORT OF WHICH EXPLORATION IS NOW IN A STATE OF PREPARATION BY PERMISSION OF CAPTAIN REYNOLDS A SUM MARY OF THE PRINCIPAL GEOLOGICAL RESULTS WAS PTUBLISHED WHICH IS NOW BEFORE THE WORLD AND FROM IT AND FROM OTHER SOURCES I HOPE TO MAKE A CONDENSED STATEMENT OF THE LEADING GEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND TO HARMONIZE SOME OF THE CONFLICTING OPINIONS WHICH MAY HAVE BEENL ADVANCED IN REGARD TO THE AGE OF THE DIFFERENT DEPOSITS IN THE WEST OPINIONS DIFFERING WIDELY FROM THOSE WLHICH MR MEEK ALND THE WRITER HAVE ADVANCED DERIVED FROM THE PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS OF THE LATTER AND OUR JOINT INVESTIGATIONS OF EXTENSIVE COLLECTIONS OF ORGANIC REMAINS HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH BY A WRITER WHO NEVER VISITED THE COUNTRY EXPLORED BY ME WHICH MAY HAVE HAD A TENDENCY IN SOME MINDS TO WEAKEN THE FORCE OF OUR STATEMENTS WITHOUT ENTERING INTO ANY DISCUSSIONLS I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT ALL OF MY STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH A CONSCIENLTIOUS REGARD FOR THE TRUTLH AND SUCH CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN DERIVED AS SEEMED LEGITIMATE LEAVING TO THE FUTURE TO CORRECT THAT WHICH IS WRONG AND APPROVE THAT WHICH IS RIGHT I CANNOT FEEL SATISFIED HOW EVER TO HAVE ANY GEOLOGIST AFTER A BRIEF EXPLORATION ANID EVEN WITHOUT ANY PERSONAL KNOW LEDGE OF THE COUNTRY PRONOUNCE MY OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WITH GREAT CARE AND PATIENCE THROUGH THE TOIL OF MANY YEARS AS ENTIRELY AT VARIANCE WITH THE TRUTH WE MAY VERY PROPERLY SEPARATE THE WESTERN PORTION OF OUR CONTINENT INTO TWO DIVISIONS MOUNTAIN AND PRAIRIE AND A COMBINATION OF THE TWO WILL FORM THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN DISTRICTOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 115 THIS DISTRICT MAY BE SAID TO COMMENCE AS SOON AS WE LEAVE THE MISSISSIPPI WESTWARD THE ASCENT BEING GRADUAL BUT CONTINUALLY OLN THE INCREASE UNTIL WE ARRIVE AT THE FOOT OF THE NMOUNTAINS LEAVING ST LOUIS WESTWARD WE GRADUALLY ASCEND PASSILNG OVER A PRAIRIE REGION FOR THE MOST PART FOR THE DISTANCE OF NEARLY 800 MILES WHEN WE HAVE REACHED AN ELEVATION OF 6000 FEET AND COME ABRUPTLY TO THE LOFTY RUGGED MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHICH COM POSE THE UPHEAVED RIDGES TO ILLUSTRATE THIS STATEMENT LET US EXAMINE THE PROFILES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM THE MISSISSIPPI WESTWARD WHICH HAVE BEENL CONSTRUCTED BY THE WAR DE PARTMENT GLANCING AT THE GENERAL MAP OF THE COUNTRY WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI ALSO PUB LISHED BY THE WAR DEPARTMENT WE WILL OBSERVE THAT THE IMMEDIATE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION IS NOT COMPOSED OF MERELY A SINGLE LOFTY UPHEAVED RIDGE EXTENDING ACROSS THE CONTI NENT BUT A VAST SERIES OF RIDGES OR RANGES WHICH TAKEN INDIVIDUALLY DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY DEFINITE TREND BUT WHEN VIEWED IN THE AGGREGATE EXTEND ACROSS THE MAP IN A DIRECTION NEARLY NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST FORMING A ZONE OR BELT 500 TO 1000 MILES IN WIDTH FROM EAST TO WEST FROM LONG 96 WESTWARD TO THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES THE COUNTRY TRAVERSED EXHIBITS THE TRUE TYPICAL PRAIRIE NO TIMBER BEING FOUND TO ANY EXTENT EXCEPT THAT WHICH SKIRTS THE STREAMS FROM THENCE TO THE PACIFIC COAST WE HAVE WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE TRUE MOUNTAIN PORTION WHICH IS COMPOSED OF A VAST NUMBER OF RIDGES OF ELEVATION INTERSPERSED WITH BEAUTIFUL VALLEYS MANY OF WHICH ARE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR FERTILITY SOME OF THE VALLEYS ARE QUITE LARGE AND ARE SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAIN RIDGES AS BY GIGANTIC WALLS IF WE LOOK AT THE BAROMETRICAL PROFILE CONSTRUCTED BY GOV STEVENS FROM ST PAULS MINIIESOTA TO THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS WESTWARD WE FIND THAT THE FORMER LOCALITY IS 828 FEET ABOVE THE SEA NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE YELLOWSTONE 670 MILES TO THE WESTWARD WE FIND THAT THE ELEVATION IS 2010 FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND THAT WE HAVE MADE A GRADUAL ASCENT IN THAT DISTANCE OF 1172 FEET AS WE APPROACH THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES THE ASCENT CONTINUES TO INCREASE AND WHEN WE REACH THE VALLEY OF DEARBORN RIVER 448 MILES FARTHER WEST WE ASCERTAIN THAT THIS LOCALITY IS 4091 FEET ABOVE THE SEA LEVEL AND THAT IN THAT DIS TANCE OF 448 MILES WE HAVE ASCENDED 2081 FEET OR NEARLY 5 FEET TO THE MILE THE VALLEY OF DEARBORN RIVER IS JUST AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND TO THAT POINT THE COUNTRY TRA VERSED BELONGS TO THE TRUE TYPE OF THE WESTERN PRAIRIE AGAIN IF WE EXAMINE THE PROFILE COMMENCING AT COUNCIL BLUFFS ON THE MISSOURI RIVER WE FIND THE ELEVATION AT THAT POINT TO BE 1327 FEET ABOVE TLHE SEA LEVEL THENCE PROCEED ING WESTWARD TO THE SOURCES OF LODGE POLE CREEK AT THE BASE OF THE LARAMIE RANGE OF MOUNTAINS WE HAVE MADE AN ASCENT WHILE THUS PASSING OVER THE PRAIRIE REGION OF NEARLY 5000 FEET WE THUS SEE THAT IN THE DISTANCE OF 550 MILES WE HAVE REACHED AN ELEVATION 3000 FEET HIGHER THAN OUR STARTING POINT BY AN ASCENT OF 5 FEET TO THE MILE AGAIN GLANCING AT THE PROFILE EXTENDING FROM FORT LEAVENWORTH WESTWARD WE OBSERVE THAT AT THE MISSOURI RIVER THE ELEVATION IS 904 FEET ABOVE THE SEA AT THE BASE OF THE LARAMIE116 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY RANGE OF MOUNTAINS 659 MILES WEST THE ELEVATION IS 6716 FEET TO SHOW THE INCREASED RAPIDITY OF ASCENT AS WE APPROACH THE VICINITY OF THE UPHEAVED RIDGES WE SEE THAT THE ELEVATION AT THE FORKS OF THE PLATTE IS 3000 FEET ABOVE THE SEA MAKING AN ASCENLT FROM THE MISSOURI RIVER TO THIS POINT A DISTANCE OF 413 MILES OF 2096 FEET OR ABOUT 5 FEET TO THE MILE FROM THE FORKS OF THE PLATTE TO THE FOOT OF THE LARAMIE MOUNTAINS A DISTANCE OF 413 MILES WE FINID AN INCREASED ELEVATION OF 3716 FEET OR 15 FEET TO THE MILE AFTER REACHING THE BASE OF THE ELEVATED RIDGES THE ASCENT IS MORE OR LESS ABRUIPT SOMETIMES RISING TO THE HEIGHT OF 3000 TO 6000 FEET ABOVE THE OPEN PRAIRIE COUNTRY AROUND WE MIGHT GIVE MANY MORE ILLUSTRATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE JUST STATED EXTENDING THEM OVER TO THE PACIFIC COAST BUT WE RESERVE THEM FOR A FUTURE OCCASION WE HAVE SAID ENOUGH HOW EVER TO INDICATE THE BEAUTIFUL UNITY IN THE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE WESTERN PORTION OF OUR CONTINENT WITH THE ABOVE BRIEF OUTLINIE OF A SUBJECT WHICH I HOPE TO PURSUE MUCH FARTHER AT SOME FUTURE TIME I PROCEED TO CONSIDER THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE MOUN TAINI CHAINS WE MAY AT ONCE MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE TWO TYPES OF MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS NAMELY THOSE ELEVATIONS WHICH HAVE A GRANITE NLUCLEUS AND FORM LONG CONITINU OUS LINES OF FRACTURE WITH FAR LESS IRREGULARITY OF OUTLINE AND THOSE RANLGES WHICH ARE COM POSED OF ERUPTED ROCKS WHICH ARE VERY RUGGED IN THEIR OUTLINE AND IRREGULAR IN THEIR TREND WE WILL IN THE FIRST PLACE EXAMINE THE BLACK HILLS AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE FIRST TYPE WHICH IS THE MOST EASTERN OUTLINE OF THE MAIN MOUNTAIN RANGE VERY LITTLE WAS KNOWN OF THESE MOUNTAINS UNTIL THEY WERE EXPLORED IN THE SUMMER OF 1857 BY AN EXPEDITION PLACED BY THE WAR DEPARTMENT UNDER THE COMMAND OF LIEUT G K WARREN T E U S A TO WHICH EXPEDITION THE WRITER WAS ATTACHED AS GEOLOGIST AND NATURALIST A PRELIMINARY RE PORT OF THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPLORATION WAS PRESENTED TO THE WAR DEPARTMENT UNLDER THE TITLE OF  EXPLORATIONS IN NEBRASKA AND DAKOTA IN THE YEARS 1855 6 AND 7 THE BLACK HILLS LIE BETWEEN THE 43D AND 45TH DEGREES OF LATITUDE AND THE 103D AND 104TH DEGREES OF LONGITUDE AND OCCUPY AN AREA ABOUT 80 MILES IN LENGTH AND FROM 30 TO 50 MILES IN WIDTH ACCORDING TO LIEUT WARREN THE SHAPE OF THE MNASS IS ELLIPTICAL AND THE MAJOR AXIS TRENDS ABOUT 200 WVEST OF NORTH THE BASE OF THESE HILLS IS ABOUT 2500 TO 3000 FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND THE HIGHEST PEAKS 6700 FEET ABOVE THE OCEAN THE WHOLE RANGE IS CLASPED AS IT WERE BY THE NORTH AND SOUTH BRANCHES OF THE BIG SHYENNE RIVER THE MOST IMPORTANT STREAM IN THIS REGION THE NORTH BRANCH PASSES ALONG THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THE RANGE RECEIVING VERY MANY OF ITS TRIBUTARIES AND MOST OF ITS WATERS FROM IT BUT TAKES ITS RISE FAR TO THE WESTWARD OF THE RANGE NEAR THE SOURCES OF POWDER RIVER IN THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE WATERS OF THE YELLOWSTONLE AND THOSE OF THE MISSOURI THE SOUTH FORK ALSO RISES IN THE SAME DIVIDE FLOWING ALONG THE SOUTHERN BASE OF THE RANGE AND ALSO RECEIVES NUMEROUS TRIBUTARIES WHICH HAVE THEIR SOURCES IN IT THESE TWOOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 117 MAIN BRANCHES UNITE ABOUT THIRTY MILES EAST OF THE BLACK HILLS FORMING THE BIG SHYENNE WHICH EMPTIES INTO THE MISSOURI ABOUT SIXTY MILES ABOVE FORT PIERRE THE MOREAU GRAND CANNIONBALL AND OTHER RIVERS FLOWING INTO THE MISSOURI NORTH OF THE SHYENNE AND SOUTH OF THE YELLOWSTONE RISE IN A HIGH TERTIARY DIVIDE NORTH OF THE BLACK HILLS AND ARE FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE SEASON QUITE SHALLOW AND SOMETIMES NEARLY DRY BUT THE LITTLE MISSOURI DERIVES A PORTION OF ITS WATERS FROM THE BLACK HILLS THROUGH A NUMBER OF SMALL BRANCHES WHICH FLOW FROM THE LNORTHWESTERN SLOPE WE THUS SEE THAT THE BLACK HILLS DO NOT GIVE RISE DIRECTLY TO ANY IMPORTANT STREAM IF WE EXCEPT THE LITTLE MISSOURI A FEW BRANCHES OF WHICH FLOW FROM SPRINGS NEAR THE BASE OF THE HILLS BUT AFFORD A COMPARATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY OF WATER FROM THAT SOURCE THE SHY ENNE IS FED FOR THE MOST PART FROM THE NUMEROUS SMALL STREAMS WHICH ISSUE FROM COPIOUS SPRINGS IN THE MORE ELEVATED PORTIONS IT WOULD SEEM THEREFORE THAT THE BLACK HILLS DO NOT HAVE A MARKED INFLUENCE UPON THE DRAINAGE OF THIS REGION I HAVE ALREADY NOTICED THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE BLACK LILLS BUT WILL STATE BRIEFLY ITS PRINCIPAL POINTS THE NUCLEUS OR CENTRAL PORTION IS COMPOSED OF A RED FELDSPATHIC GRANITE WITH A SERIES OF METAMORPHIC SLATES AND SCHISTS SUPERIMPOSED AND THENCE UPON EACH SIDE OF THE AXIS OF ELEVATION THE VARIOUS FOSSILIFEROUS FORMATIONS OF THIS REGION FOLLOW IN THEIR ORDER TO THE SUMMITS OF THE CRETACEOUS THE WHOLE INCLINING AGAINST THE GRANITOID ROCKS AT A GREATER OR LESS ANGLE FROM THE ABOVE FACTS WE DRAW TLLE INFERENCE THAT PRIOR TO THE ELEVATION OF THE BLACK HILLS WHICH MUST HAVE OCCURRED AFTER THE DEPOSITION OF THE CRETACEOUS ROCKS ALL THESE FORMATIONS PRESENTED AN UNBROKEN CONTINUITY OVER THE WHOLE AREA OCCUPIED BY THESE MOUNTAINS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONCLUSION AND WE WILL HEREAFTER SEE ITS APPLICATION TO OTHER RANGES AND ALSO TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN RANGE TAKEN IN THE AGGREGATE PROCEEDING IN A SOUTHWEST DIRECTION FROM THE BLACK HILLS ALONG THE ANTICLINAL WE SEE AMPLE EVIDENCES OF THE CONNECTION OF THESE HILLS WITH THE LARAMIE MOUNTAINS BY THE LARAMIE MOUNTAINS WE DESIGNATE THOSE EASTERN RANGES WHICH EXTEND FROM THE RED BUTTES SOUTHWARD TO THE ARKANSAS THIS RANGE WHEN EXAMINED IN DETAIL IS COMPOSED OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALLER RANGES ALL SO FAR AS I HAVE OBSERVED OF THE TRUE GRANITIC TYPE RHE TREND OF THE WHOLE GROUP IS VERY NEARLY NORTH AND SOUTH NORTHWARD AS FAR AS FORT LARA MIE WHERE THEY MAKE AN ABRUPT FLEXURE AROUND TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST AND GRADUALLY CEASE OR DIE OUT AT THE RED BUTTES FROM THIS POINT WESTWARD AND NORTHWARD THERE IS A SPACE OF FROM TWENTY TO FORTY MILES IN WIDTH DESTITUTE OF MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS THOUGH THE STRATA EXHIBIT EVIDENCE OF DISLOCATION OR CRUST MOVEMENTS GEOLOGICALLY THE LARAMIE RANGE IS ALSO COMPOSED OF A GRANITOID NUCLEUS WITH THE FOSSILI FEROUS FORMATIONS SILURIAN CARBONIFEROUS RED ARENACEOUS BEDS JURASSIC CRETACEOUS AND IN MANY PLACES LIGNITE TERTIARY INCLINING FROM EACH SIDE OF A CENTRAL AXIS AT VARIOUS ANGLES118 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY IT IS FRORN THESE MOUNTAINS THAT THE NUMEROUS BRANCHES OF THE PLATTE HAVE THEIR SOURCES EXTENDING A DISTANCE OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED MILES AGAIN THE DYNAMICAL STRUCTURE OF THIS RANGE WARRANTS THE INFERENCE THAT THESE ROCKS IN A MORE OR LESS HORIZONTAL POSITION WERE CONTINUOUS OVER THE WHOLE AREA AT PRESENT OCCUPIED BY IT SOME TIME DURING THE TERTIARY PERIOD THE MINERALS OF ECONOMICAL VALUE ARE QUITE EXTENSIVE THE GOLD MINES OF PIKES PEAK ARE IN THIS RANGE AND THE EVIDENCE IS QUITE CONCLUSIVE THAT THIS PRECIOUS METAL WILL BE FOUND TO A GREATER OR LESS EXTENT ALL ALONG THE EASTERN SLOPE IRON ORE IS FOUND IN GREAT ABUNDANLCE AND OF THE BEST QUALITY WHILE ALONG THE NORTH PLATTE AND IN THE VICINITY OF PIKES PEAK LIGNITE IS KNOWN TO EXIST IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES AND HAS BEEN USED FOR FUEL THE NMOST IMPORTANT OUTLIER OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS ON THE EASTERN SLOPE IS THE BIG HORN RANGE WHICH THOUGH SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR IN THE SHAPE OF ITS MASS HAS A GENERAL TREND NEARLY NORTHWEST ANLD SOUTHEAST IT OCCUPIES AN AREA ABOUT 180 MILES IN LENGTH AND 50 IN BREADTH NEAR LATITUDE 433O AND LONGITUDE 102 THE LINE OF FRACTURE SEEMS TO HAVE CEASED TOWARD THE SOUTH OR SOUTHEAST AND TO HAVE MADE A GRADUAL FLEXURE AROUND TO THE WEST THE WHOLE RANLGE SOON LOSING ITS GRANITOID CHARACTER AND BECOMING ENTIRELY COMPOSED OF MORE MODERN ERUPTIVE ROCKS THE ERUPTIVE PORTION CONTINUES WESTWARD UNTIL IT JOINS ON TO THE WIND RIVER RANGE NEAR THE SOURCES OF WIND RIVER AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS WE CAN TRACE A SINGLE LOW ANTICLINAL ACROSS THE PRAIRIE CONNECTING THESE MOUNTAINS WITH THE LARAMIE RANGE AT RED BUTTES ON THE NORTH PLATTE WE ALSO KNOW BY THE POSITION OF THE FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA UPHEAVED ALONG THE MOUNTAINS THAT THE GRADUAL FLEX URE OF THE RANGE TO THE WEST JOINS ON TO THE ERUPTIVE PORTION AND THUS FORMS A CONNECTION WITH THE WIND RIVER RANGE THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THESE MOUNTAINS IS ALSO COMPOSED OF GRANITE AND GRANITOID ROCKS WITH THE SAME SERIES OF FOSSILIFEROUS FORMATIONS INCLINING AT VARIOUS ANGLES FROM EACH SIDE OF THE AXIS OF ELEVATION AS ARE SEEN AROUND THE BLACK HILLS AND ALONG THE LARAMIE MOUN TAINS SOME OF THE MORE LOFTY PEAKS ARE FROM 8000 TO 12000 FEET ABOVE THE SEA ANLD ARE CLOTHED WITH PERPETUAL SNOW WE THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE IS QUITE CLEAR THAT UP TO THE TIME OF THE ACCUMULATIOIN OF A LARGE PORTION OF THE LIGNITE TERTIARY BEDS ALL THESE FORMATIONS FROM THE SILURIAN TO THE TRUE LIGNITE STRATA INCLUSIVE WERE IN A HORIZONTAL POSI TION EXTENDING CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE WHOLE AREA OCCUPIED BY THE MOUNTAINLS BUT AS THEY WERE SLOWLY ELEVATED THE CENTRAL PORTIONS WERE REMOVED BY THE EROSIVE ACTION OF ATMO SPHERIC AGENCIES THE ERUPTIVE PORTION WHICH UNITES THE BIG HORN RANGE WITH THE WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS IS EXCEEDINGLY PICTURESQUE PRESENTING THE APPEARANCE OF A CONNECTED SERIES OF BASALTIC CONES AND SO RUGGED AND INACCESSIBLE ARE THEY TLHAT THE PERSEVERING TRAPPERS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PENETRATE THEM IN THEIR HUNTING EXPLORATIONS LIKE THE BLACK HILLS THE BIG HORN RANOGE DOES NOT GIVE RISE TO MANY IMPIORTANT SUBOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 119 HYDROGRAPHICAL BASINS THE LARGEST STREAM IN THIS REGION AND ONE WHICH GIVES NAMLE TO THE MOUNTAINS RISES IN THE WIND RIVER RANGE PASSES THROUGH THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS AND UNITES WITH THE YELLOWSTONE ABOUT SEVENTY MILES TO THE SOUTHWARD BEFORE REACHING THE MOUNTAINS IT TAKES THE NAME OF WIND RIVER AND ASSUMES THE NAME OF BIG HORN AFTER EMERGING FROM THEM THIS RANGE HOWEVER CONSTITUTES QUITE AN IMPORTANT FEEDER TO THE YELLOWSTONE POWDER RIVER WHICH RISES IN THIS RANGE BY NUMEROUS BRANCHES DRAINS A LARGE AREA MOSTLY LIGNITE TERTIARY AND POURS A CONSIDERABLE VOLUME OF WATER INTO THE YELLOW STONE NEAR LON 105I AND LAT 46I TONGUE RIVER IS THE NEXT MOST IMPORTANT STREAM WHICH THOUGH NOT DRAINING SO GREAT AN AREA AS POWDER RIVER EMPTIES INTO THE YELLOWSTONE A MUCH LARGER BULK OF WATER THE MEDICINE BOW AND SWEET WATER MOUNTAINS APPEAR TO BE OF THE SAME CHARACTER FOR THE MOST PART BUT OIL THE EAST SIDE OF THE SWEET WATER RIVER THE EVIDENCE OF IGNEOUS ACTION IS SHOWN ON A LARGE SCALE THE ANCIENT VOLCANIC MATERIAL WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ELEVATED TO A GREAT HEIGHT IN BUT A PARTIALLY FLUID CONDITION AND THEN TO HAVE GRADUALLY COOLED AFFECTING TO A GREATER OR LESS EXTENT THE FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA IN CONTACT NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THE POPO AGIE WITH WIND RIVER WE COME IN FULL VIEW OF THE WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS WHICH FORM THE DIVIDING CREST OF THE CONTINENT THE STREAMS ON THE ONE SIDE FLOWING INTO THE ATLANTIC AND THOSE ON THE OTHER INTO THE PACIFIC THIS RANGE IS ALSO COMPOSED TO A LARGE EXTENT OF RED AND GRAY FELDSPATHIC GRANITE WITH THE FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS INCLININIG HIGH UPON ITS SIDES AFTER PASSING THE SOURCES OF WIND RIVER THE MOUNTAINS APPEAR TO BE COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF ERUPTIVE ROCKS EVEN THE THREE TETONS WHICH RAISE THEIR SUMMITS ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE OCEAN LEVEL ARE FORMED OF VERY COMPACT BASALTIC ROCK THE WASATCH AND GREEN RIVER RANGES WHERE WE OBSERVED THEM HAVE THE SAME IGNEOUS ORIGIN AND THE MOUNTAINS ALL ALONG THE SOUIRCES OF THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE COLUMBIA EXHIBIT THESE ROCKS IN TLLEIR FULL FORCE IN PIERRES HOLE JACKSONS HOLE AND OTHER VALLEYS SURROUNDED BY UPHEAVED RIDGES THESE ANCIENT VOLCANIC ROCKS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN POURED OUT OVER THE COUNTRY AND TO HAVE COOLED IN LAYERS GIVING TO VAST THICK NESSES OF THE ROCKS THE APPEARANCE OF STRATIFIED BEDS THE MOUNTAINS ABOUT THE SOURCES OF THE MISSOURI AND YELLOWSTONE RIVERS ARE OF ERUPTIVE ORIGIN AND IN THE VALLEY OF THE MADISON FORK OF THE MISSOURI ARE VERTICAL WALLS OF THESE ANCIENT VOLCANIC ROCKS ONE THOUSAND TO FIFTEENL HUNDRED FEET IN HEIGHT EXHIBITING THE AP PEARANCE OF REGULARLY STRATIFIED DEPOSITS DIPPING AT A CONSIDERABLE ANGLE AS WE PASS DOWN THE MADISON WE FIND SOME BEDS OF FELDSPATHIC ROCKS AND MICA AND CLAY SLATES BENEATH THE ERUPTIVE LAYERS DIPPING AT THE SAME ANGLE AFTER PASSING THE DIVIDE BELOW THE THREE FORKS OF THE MISSOURI WE SEE A NUMBER OF PARTIALLY DETACHED RANGES WHICH APPEAR TO BE OF THE SAME IGNEOUS CHARACTER IN THE BELT HIGHWOOD MOUNTAINS AND INDEED ALL ALONG THE EASTERN SLOPE IN THIS REGION WE FIND CONTINUAL EVIDENCE OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE FLUID MA120 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY TERIAL IN THE FORM OF SURFACE BEDS OR IN LAYERS THRUST BETWEEN THE FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA THESE IGNIEOUS BEDS THINL OUT RAPIDLY AS WE RECEDE FROM THE POINT OF EFFULSION A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE CENTRES OF PROTRUSION MAY BE SEEN ALONG THE SLOPE OF THE MOUNTAINS WEST OF THE JUDITH RANGE THE ERUPTED MATERIAL SOMETIMES PRESENTS A VERTICAL WALL THREE HUN DRED FEET HIGH THEN SUDDENLY THINS OUT AND DISAPPEARS THE JUDITH BEARS PAW AND LITTLE ROCKY MOUNTAINS SEEM TO BE COMPOSED FOR THE MOST PART OF GRANIITE ANID OTHER ROCKS WITH IGNEOUS PROTRUSIONS HERE AND THERE I HAVE IN A FORMER PAPER EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF OUR MOUNTAIN RANGYES ARE COMPOSED OF FELDSPATHIC GRANITE AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THIS IS TRUE IN REGARD TO THE MORE EASTERN OUTLIERS BUT MORE RECENT OBSERVATIONIS HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT THESE ROCKS WVHICH I HAVE DEFINED BY THE TERM ERUIP TIVE COMPOSE BY FAR THE GREATER PORTIOLN OF THE MOUNTAIN MASSES OF THE WEST WE HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT THE POTSDAM SANDSTONE IN ITS WESTERN EXTEN SION WAS FIRST MADE KNROWN AS OCCURRING IN THE BLACK HILLS IT HERE RESTS UPON THE UP TURNED OR NEARLY VERTICAL EDGES OF THE SCHISTS CLAY SLATES AND GRANITOID ROCKS AND THE INFERENCE WAS DRAWN THAT THE SAME ROCK WOULD BE FOUND FORMING AN OUTCROPPING BELT ALL ALONG THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS SUBSEQUENT EXPLORATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT IT ALSO OCCURS ALONG THE MNARGINS OF THE BIG HORLN RANGE NEAR THE SUMMIT HOLDING THE SAME RELATIVE POSITIOLN AND EXHIBITING THE SAME LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS A FEW THINI LAYERS OF FINE CALCAREOUS SANIDSTONIE WERE OBSERVED FILLED WITH FOSSILS CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS PERIOD AT THE HEAD OF LA BONTE CREEK IN THE LARAMIE RANGE I NOTICED A BED RESTING DISCORDANTLY UPON AZOIC SLATES FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED FEET IN THICKNESS HOLDING THE SAME POSITION ANLD POSSESSING THE SAME LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS WHICH IT REVECALS AT OTHER LOCALITIES I COULD DISCOVER NO FOSSILS IN IT AT THIS POINT BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS BED REPRESENTS THE POTS DAM SANDSTONE THE SAME BED SEEMS TO OCCUR ALL ALONG THE MOUNTAINS FROM LARAMIE PEAK TO CACHE LA POUDRE CREEK UNDERLYING THE WELLKNOWN CARBONIFEROUS STRATA AND RESTING UPON THE DECOMPOSING GRANITOID ROCKS WHICH FORM THE NUCLEUS OF THE FIRST OR LOWER RIDGE THIS ROCK THE POTSDAM IS MORE OR LESS CHANGED BY HEAT FROM BELLEATH BUT I WAS ABLE TO TRACE IT CONTINUOUSLY FROM THE SOURCE OF THE CHUGWATER CREEK TO THE SOURCE OF CACHE LA POUDRE A DISTANCE OF OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES IT WAS ALSO SEEN ALOLNG THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS BUT DID NOT CONTAIN ANY ORGANIC REMAINS THE ABOVE FACTS SHOW VERY CLEARLY THAT IN ITS WESTERN EXTENSION THE PRIMORDIAL ZONE OF BARRANDE IS REPRESENTED ONLY BY A THIN BED OF SANDSTONE NEVER EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET IN THICKNESS AND THAT IS SEEN ONLY IN A VERY NARROW OUTCROPPING BELT NEAR THE MARGINS OF THE MOUNTAIN CRESTS THE STRATIFIED AZOIC ROCKS UPON WHICH IT RESTS DISCORD ANLTLY SO FAR AS MY OBSERVATIONS HAVE EXTENDED NIEVER REACH A VERY GREAT THICKNESS IN THE WEST ON BOTH SIDES OF THE DIVIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS SO FAR AS OUR EXPLORATIONS HAVE EXOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 121 TENDED A SERIES OF CALCAREOUS ARENOCALCAREOUS AND ARENACEOUS BEDS ARE SEEN WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED TO THE CARBONIFEROUS EPOCH THEY VARY IN THICKNESS AT DIFFERENT POINTS WITHOUT SPECIFYING LOCALITIES IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO REMARK THAT ALL ALONG THE MARGINS OF ANY OF THE MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS IN THE FAR WEST THESE ROCKS ARE SEEN IN A MIORE OR LESS IN CLINED POSITION SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT VISIBLE FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AS BETWEEN THE LARAMIE AND PLATTE RIVERS TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES BUT IT IS PLAIN THAT THEY HAVE EITHER BEEN REMOVED BY ERO SION OR CONCEALED BY MORE RECENT DEPOSITS ALONG THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS THERE ARE AL TERNATE LAYERS OF SANDSTONE ARENACEOUS AND MAGNESIAN LIMESTONES MANY OF WHICH SHOW OBLIQUE LAMINAE AND OTHER INDICATIONS THAT THEIR DEPOSITION TOOK PLACE IN SHALLOW AND PER HAPS TURBULENT WATERS THEY ARE HERE DEVELOPED TO A THICKNESS OF ONE THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET AND INCLINE HLIGH UPON THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAINS AT AN ANGLE OF 50 TO 70 THEY CONTAIN FEW FOSSILS BUT THESE INDICATE ROCKS OF THE SAME AGE AS THOSE IN THE BLACK HILLS ALONG THE LARAMIE MOUNTAINS FROM THE RED BUTTES TO PIKES PEAK APPARENTLY THE SAME LIMESTONES ARE SEEN INICLINING AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE ELEVATED RIDGES AT GREATER OR LESS ANGLES AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AXIS SLOPING DOWN TO THE LARAMIE PLAINS THE CORRESPONDING STRATA ARE SEEN THOUGH LEANING AT MUCH SMALLER ANGLES USUALLY FROM 90 TO 150 ALONG THE SWEETWATER AND WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS THESE ROCKS ARE HIGHLY DEVE LOPED AND INCLINE AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE RIDGES OF ELEVATION AS HERETOFORE DESCRIBED THE CORRESPONDING PORTIONS ARE ALSO SEEN ON THE WEST SLOPE OF THE MAIN RANGE AT THE SOURCES OF GREEN AND SNAKE RIVERS BUT NOT AS CONSPICUOUSLY DEVELOPED THE ERUPTIVE ROCKS PRE DOMINATING CROSSING BACK OVER THE DIVIDING CREST NEAR THE SOURCES OF THE MADISON JEF FERSON AND GALLATIN FORKS OF THE MISSOURI WE FIND SIMILAR LIMESTONES LARGELY DEVELOPED AND COVERING A CONSIDERABLE AREA ON THE EASTERN SLOPE NEAR THE JUNCTION OF THE THREE FORKS AND ALONG SMITHS OR KAMAS RIVER WE FIND THEM REACHING A THICKNESS OF EIGHT HUN DRED TO ONE THOUSAND FEET OFTEN PARTIALLY CHANGED BY CONTACT WITH IGNEOUS ROCKS BENEATH THEY WERE ALSO OBSERVED AROUND THE JUDITH MOUNTAINS AND ALSO ABOUT THE BEARS PAW AND LITTLE ROCKY MOUNTAINS NOWHERE IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN RANGE SO FAR AS MY OBSERVATIONIS HAVE EXTENDED DO THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS SEEM TO ABOUND IN ORGANIC REMAINS AND THE FEW USUALLY SEEN ARE GENE RALLY FOUND IN A BAD STATE OF PRESERVATION AND COMPRISE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SPECIES THE PRECISE PERIOD TO WHICH THESE ROCKS BELONG WHICH ARE SO PERSISTENT IN ALL DISTURBED REGIONS IS NOT POSITIVELY KNOWN THE EVIDENCE FROM ORGANIC REMAINS POINTING TO THE AGE OF THE COAL MEASURES AND SOMETIMES TO THAT OF THE LOWER CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD PROBABLY BOTH MEM BERS OF THE SYSTEM OCCUR THERE AT THE FOOT OF THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS NEAR THE HEAD OF POWDER RIVER I OBSERVED AT ONE LOCALITY A SERIES OF BEDS WHICH INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF PERNMIAN ROCKS THESE BEDS VOL XII161 22 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF CHERTY MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE ARE VERY MUCH LIKE THOSE ALREADY DE SCRIBED IN NORTHEASTERN KANSAS AND CONTAIN IN GREAT ABUNDANCE SOME OF THE SAME SPECIES OF FOSSILS AS MYALINA PERATTEVZDTA AND OTHERS I HAVE ALSO SEEN SIMILAR LIMESTONES IN OTHER LOCALITIES BUT NO FOSSILS WERE DETECTED AND THOUGH HAVING A PERMIAN APPEARANCE THEY MAY BELONG TO THE UPPER PORTIOLN OF THE CARBONIFEROUS THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR IN MANY LOCALITIES THAT PRIOR TO THE DEPOSITION OF THE RED MARLS SUCCEEDING THE SUPPOSED PERMIAN A VERY GREAT EROSION OF THE SURFACE OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS TOOK PLACE WE FIND FOR EXAMPLE IN MANY LOCALITIES ONLY A THIN REPRESENTATION OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS AND AGAIN A FULL DEVELOPMENT ONE THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN HULNDRED FEET IN THICKNESS OVERLYING THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS AND EQUALLY PERSISTENT WITH THEM IS A SERIES OF RED ARENACEOUS MARL BEDS OR GYPSUMBEARING MARLS WHICH ARE COEXTENSIVE WITH THE UPHEAVED SEDIMENTARY FORMATIONS ALONG THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THE LARGEST DEVELOPMENT OF THESE BEDS WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED OCCURS ON THE NORTHEASTERN SIDE OF THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS AND ON THE WEST SLOPE OF THE WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS NEAR THE SOURCE OF THE GROS VENTRES FORK OF SNAKE RIVER FROM THE RED BUTTES ON THE NORTH PLATTE TO PIKES PEAK THESE BEDS ARE OFTEN REMOVED BY EROSION OR CONCEALED BY SUPERFICIAL DEPOSITS BUT THEIR APPEARANCE IN NUMEROUS PLACES SHOWS VERY CLEARLY THAT BENEATH THE SURFACE THEY OCCUPY A CONSIDERABLE AREA THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY BORDERING THE MOUNTAIN RANGES POSSIBLY EXTENDING ENTIRELY OVER THE EASTERN SLOPE PASSING OVER INTO THE LARAMIE PLAINS WE FIND THAT THE RED MARLS CONSTITUTE THE SURFACE FORMATION OF THE PLAINI COUNTRY IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN FROM THE INVESTIGATIONS OF MESSRS MEEK AND ENGELMANN THAT THESE BEDS ARE REVEALED ALONG THE WASATCH MOUNTAINS EVEN SOUTH OF LAKE UTAH FURNISHING UNDOUBTED EVIDENCE THAT THEY BELONG TO THE SAME GREAT DEPOSIT THE FACT ALSO THAT ONE THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET OF RED ARENACEOUS BEDS ARE SEENI NEAR THE SOURCES OF GREEN RIVER LEADS TO THE INFERENCE THAT THEY CONTINUE SOUTHWARD FAR DOWN THE GREEN RIVER VALLEY TO THAT PORTION WHICH TAKES THE NAME OF COLORADO AND ARE IN FACT A CONTINUATION OF THE EXTENSIVE RED DEPOSITS DE SCRIBED BY VARIOUS EXPLORERS IN NEW MEXICO THESE RED BEDS ARE ALSO SEEN UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES HIGHLY DEVELOPED ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AT THE SOURCES OF THE MISSOURI THERE SEENIS TO BE A CHANGE IN THE LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS BELOW THE GATE OF THE MOUNTAINS THE PECULIAR RED DEPOSITS DISAPPEARING FOR THE MOST PART AND A SERIES OF IRREGULAR LAYERS OF SILICIOUS LIMESTONE WITH A REDDISH TINGE AND WITH OBLIQUE LAMINAE RIPPLEMARK AND OTHER INDICATIONS OF SHALLOW WATER DEPOSITION IT IS THROUGH THESE LAYERS OF ROCK THAT THE MISSOURI RIVER CUTS ITS WAY FROM THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE MOUTH OF HIGLHWOOD CREEK ABOUT TEN MILES BELOW THE FALLS THEY ARE ALSO DISTINCTLY REVEALED AROUND THE JUDITH MOUNTAINS ALONG THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS THICK LAYERS OF GYPSUM OCCUR BUT THE GYPSUM BEDS ARE BY NO MEANS COEXTENSIVE WITH THE RED DEPOSITS AND INDEED ARE PRESENT IN BULT FEWV LOCALITIES NEAR THE HEAD OF POWDER RIVEROF THE UPPER MISSOURI 123 THE AGGREGATE THICKNESS OF THE GYPSUM STRATA IS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET WHILE NEAR THE SOURCE OF SNAKE RIVER THERE IS A THICKNESS FROM FIFTY TO EIGHTY FEET IT ALSO OCCURS TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS ON LA BONTE CREEK A BRANCH OF THE NORTH PLATTE AT THE TIME OF WRITING THE PRECEDING REPORT NO DIVISION HAD BEEN MADE OF THE RED BEDS SEPARATE FROM THE JURASSIC BECAUSE AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO PROOF THAT THEY WERE DISTINCT NO ORGANIC REMAINS HAVING BEEN OBTAINED FROM THEM WE ONLY KNEW THAT THEY HELD A POSITION BELOW THE WELLESTABLISHED JURASSIC ROCKS AND THAT SO FAR AS HAD BEEN OBSERVED THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL BREAK IN THE SEQUENCE OF TLLE STRATA THESE RED BEDS HOWEVER WHEN COMPARED WITH SIMILAR RED ROCKS IN THE OLD WORLD HAD BEEN OFTEN REFERRED TO THE AGE OF THE TRIASSIC OR NEW RED SANDSTONE THE EXPLORATIONS OF DR NEWBERRY IN NEW MEXICO REVEALED QUITE A NUMBER OF SPECIES OF PLANTS AND THE BONES OF A LARGE SAURIAN ANIMAL WHICH SEEM TO DIRECT HIS MIND TOWARD THE TRIASSIC EPOCH THE PLANTS DISCOVERED BY DR NEW BERRY IN NEW MEXICO WERE REFERRED BY HIM TO THE GENERA ZAMITES PTEROPHYLLUML C AND REGARDED AS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE KEUPER UPPER TRIAS OF EUROPE THOUGH THE EVIDENCE SO FAR OBTAINED POINTS QUITE STRONIGLY TOWARD THE TRIASSIC EPOCH IT IS NOT YET CONSIDERED SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TO WARRANT A POSITIVE OPINION IN REGARD TO THEIR AGE IF THESE RED ARENACEOUS DEPOSITS REALLY REPRESENT A DISTINCT GEOLOGICAL EPOCH IT SEEMS QUITE STRANGE THAT THEY HAVE AS YET YIELDED SO FEW ORGANIC REMAINS THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXAMINED WITH CONSIDERABLE CARE OVER AN AREA IN THE VICINITY OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS EXTENDING FROM LATITUDE 490 FAR SOUTHWARD INTO NEW MEXICO ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS WE HAVE DISCOVERED FOSSILS BENEATH THE RED BEDS WHICH MAY INCLUDE THOSE IN THE JURASSIC THE JURASSIC ROCKS ARE EVERYWHERE REVEALED OVERLYING THE RED DEPOSITS JUST MENTIONED AND POSSESS AN EQUAL GEOGRAPHICAL EXTENSION THEIR FULLEST DEVELOPMENT AND MOST FOSSILIFEROUS CONDITION SEEMS TO BE ALONG THE MARGINS OF THE BLACK HILLS WHERE THEY HAVE FURNISHED THE MOST SATISFACTORY EVIDELNCE OF THEIR AGE ALONG THE NORTHEASTERN SLOPE OF THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS THIS GROUP OF ROCKS PRESENTS ITS USUAL APPEARANCE OF GRAY AND WHITISH CALCAREOUS AND ARENACEOUS LAYERS WITH INDURATED SOMEWHAT VARIEGATED BEDS OF MORE OR LESS LAMINATED MARLS CONTAINING IN GREAT ABUNDANCE BELEINNNITES DENSUS PENTACRINUS ASTERISCUS A NEW SPECIES OF OSTREA PECTEN C AT RED BUTTES WE FIND A FAIR DEVELOPMENT OF THESE BEDS WITH THE SAME FOSSILS BUT AS WE PROCEED SOUTHWARD TOWARD LONGS PEAK THE INTERCALATED LAMINATED MARLS DISAPPEAR AND THE WHOLE FORMATION SEEMS TO BE REDUCED TO A THICKNESS OF FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED FEET WITH VERY FEW FOSSILS ALONG THE SOUTHWEST SIDE OF THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS AND THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF THE WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS WE HAVE A THICKNESS OF JURASSIC ROCKS FROM EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND FEET CONTAINING ORGANIC REMAINS IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE CROSSING THE WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS WE OBSERVED THE STRATA CORRESPONDING TO THOSE UPON THE EASTERN SIDE WITH BELEMNITES DENSUTS OSTREAL C RETURNING TO THE EASTERN SLOPE AT THE SOURCES OF124 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY THE MISSOURI WE SEE OCCASIONAL INDICATIONS OF THEIR EXISTENCE BUT NOT SO CONSPICUOUS AS TO BE READILY IDENTIFIED THE AGE OF THIS GROUP OF ROCKS MAY BE NOW CONSIDERED AS THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED SO GREAT A NUMBER OF FOSSILS WHICH APPEAR TO BE OF UNDOUBTED JURASSIC TYPES HAVE BEEN OBTAINED I HAVE REMARKED THAT THE OLDER FOSSILIFEROUS BEDS DOUBTLESS PASS BENEATH THE MNORE RECENT CRETACEOUS AND TERTIARY DEPOSITS AND OCCUPY A GREATER OR LESS AREA UNDERNEATH THE PRAIRIE COUNTRY EAST OF THE 1 DIVIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS I HAVE MADE THIS INFERENCE FROM THE FACT THAT WHERE ANY ELEVATIONS OCCUR THE COMPLETE SERIES OF FOSSILIFEROUS BEDS ARE EX POSED AROUND THE AXIS OF UPHEAVAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE GEOLOGISTS WHO MAY BE CON STRUCTING GEOLOGICAL MAPS OF THIS PORTION OF THE WEST I WOULD SAY THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THE OLDER FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS FROM THE POTSDAM TO THE JURASSIC INCLUSIVE EXPOSED EXCEPT IN NARROW OUTCROPPING BELTS AROUND THE MARGINS OF THE MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS OCCUPY A BELT FROM ONE TO TWO MILES WIDE AND THE RED ARENACEOUS DE POSITS ARE EXPOSED OVER ABOUT THE SAME AREA WHILE THE JURASSIC FORM A ZONE NEVER MORE THAN ONEFOURTH OF A MILE TO THREE MILES IN WIDTH THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL FACTS IN REGARD TO THE CRETACEOUS ROCKS OF THE UPPER MISSOURI WERE OBTAINED DURING THE LAST EXPEDITIOLL TO THAT REGION I HAVE PREFERRED TO ALLUDE BRIEFLY TO THEM HERE INASMUCH AS THEY WILL APPEAR IN DETAIL IN A FORTHCOMING REPORT THE VARIOUS SUBDIVISIONS OF THE CRETACEOUS GROUP IN THE WEST WERE OBSERVED AT NUMEROUS LOCALITIES THE STRATA IN MANY PLACES OCCUPY LARGE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS HOLDING A HORIZONTAL POSITION IN OTHERS FORMING A BELT OR ZONE OF GREATER OR LESS WIDTH AROUND THE MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS NO 1 IS A WELLMARKED AND DISTINCT DIVISION ALONG THE MISSOURI RIVER FROM DE SOTO TO A POINT ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE BIG SIOUX RIVER IN THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF KAN SAS AND NEBRASKA AND IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST BUT WHEN WE COME INTO THE VICINITY OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGES IN THE NORTHWEST ITS TYPICAL LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS ARE WANTING AND APPARENTLY AN INCREASED DEVELOPMENT OF NO 2 ONLY IS SEEN ALONG TLLE BIG HORN MOUN TAINS NO 2 IS EIGHT HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND FEET IN THICKNESS COMPOSED OF BLACK PLASTIC CLAY WITH SEVERAL LAYERS OF GRAY AND YELLOWISH CALCAREOUS SANDSTONES TEN TO FIFTY FEET IN THICKNESS ALONG THE LARAMIE AND WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS THE SAME CHARACTERS ARE SHOWN AFTER LEAVING THE MISSOURI NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE NIOBRARA RIVER NO 3 IS NEVER SEEN PRE SENTING ITS TYPICAL MARLY CHARACTER IN THE VICINITY OF THE BLACK HILLS WE SAW A SERIES OF BEDS COMPOSED OF ALTERNATE THIN LAYERS OF ARENACEOUS AND ARGILLACEOUS SEDIMENTS WITH OSTREA CONGESTA AND INOCERAINUS PROBLEMATICUS WHICH MAY POSSIBLY REPRESENT NO 3 ALONG THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS AND FROM RED BUTTES TO CACHE LA POUDRE CREEK THE SAME FOSSILS WERE OFTEN FOUND AND SOME OTHER INDICATIONS OF ITS EXISTENCE BUT NO WELLMARKED TYPICAL BEDS  WE MEAN THAT THE DISTINCTIVE LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS OF NO 1 AS SEEN ON THE MISSOURI DO NOT APPEAR ALONG THE MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS IT IS PROBABLE THAT NOS 1 AND 2 ARE MERGED INTO EACH OTHER AND LITHOLOGICALLY FORM ONE DIVISION FARTHER EVIDENCE IS NEEDED BEFORE WE CAN SPEAK POSITIVELY IN REGARD TO THIS POINTOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 125 WERE SEEN IT IS NOW WELL KNOWN THAT 0 CONGESTA AND 1 PROBLEMATICUS RANGE DOWN INTO NO 2 SO THAT NO 3 IN THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST MAY GIVE PLACE TO AN INCREASED DEVELOP MENT OF NO 2 NOS 4 AND 5 ARE LARGELY DEVELOPED EVERYWHERE WHEN NOT CONCEALED BY THE OVERLYING TERTIARY DEPOSITS ESPECIALLY ALONG THE LARAMIE MOUNTAINS AND IN THE VALLEY OF CACHE LA POUDRE IN THE VALLEY OF WIND RIVER ALL THE CRETACEOUS ROCKS DOWN TO NO 2 APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY EROSION PRIOR TO THE DEPOSITION OF THE TERTIARY BEDS AND THE CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS OF NO 2 ARE QUITE ABUNDANT AS WE PASS OVER MOUNTAINS WE HAVE INCLINING AGAINST THE WESTERN SLOPE SIX TO EIGHT HUNDRED FEET OF ALTERNATIONS OF BLACK PLASTIC CLAYS ARENACEOUS MARLS AND BEDS OF SANDSTONES AND LIMESTONE WITH A FEW SEAMS OF CARBONACEOUS MATTER PASSING UP INTO CALCAREOUS AND ARENACEOUS COMPACT ROCKS IN SOME ARENACEOUS LIMESTONES NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE SERIES AND EXTENDING UPWARD QUITE ABUNDANT FOSSILS WERE OBSERVED AMONG THEM A LARGE INOCERARNUS TWO SPECIES OF OSTREA A LARGE PINNA FOUR INCHES IN LENGTH A CARDIUM AND A NUMBER OF UNDETERMINED SPECIES WITH FRAGMENTS OF SILICIFIED WOOD THE GENERAL DIP OF THESE ROCKS IS ABOUT 200 THESE WELLMARKED CRETA CEOUS BEDS PASS UP QUITE IMPERCEPTIBLY INTO AN ENORMOUS THICKNESS OF LIGNITE TERTIARY PASSING OVER THE DIVIDING CREST TO THE HEAD WATERS OF THE MISSOURI WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY INDICATIONS OF CRETACEOUS ROCKS UNTIL WE HAD DESCENDED BELOW THE THREE FORKS WHERE WE FIND TRACES LEFT AFTER EROSION THEY DO NOT REVEAL THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUSLY UNTIL WE ARRIVE WITHIN TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OF FORT BENTON WHERE THE BLACK PLASTIC CLAY BEGINS TO OVER LAP THE JURASSIC ROCKS WITH ITS CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS AND ON REACHING FORT BENTON THE PLASTIC CLAY IS QUITE HOMOGENEOUS AND IS DEVELOPED TO A THICKNESS OF EIGHT HUNDRED FEET AS WE PROCEED TOWARD THE MOUTH OF THE JUDITH RIVER AND NEAR THE JUDITH MOUNTAINS WE FIND QUITE THICK BEDS OF CONCRETIONARY SANDSTONE WHICH FORM THE  STONE WALLS  CITADEL C IT IS FROM THESE BEDS THAT WE HAVE OBTAINED A GROUP OF FOSSILS WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED PROVISIONALLY TO NO 1 BUT WHICH SEEM TO BE SPECIFICALLY DISTINCT FROM ALL OTHERS IN THE WEST IT MAY BE THAT WHEN THIS GROUP OF BEDS NOW REFERRED TO NOS 1 AND 2 COMPRISING A THICKNESS OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND FEET IN THIS REGION ARE MORE CAREFULLY STUDIED THAT SEVERAL SUBDIVISIONS WILL BE MADE HAVING EQUAL IMPORTANCE WITH THE OTHERS DURING THE PAST SEASON OUR ROUTE LED US ALONG THE  DIVIDE BETWEEN THE MISSOURI AND YELLOWSTONE RIVERS SOUTH OF THE JUDITH MOUNTAINS SO THAT WE PASSED OUTSIDE OF ANY GOOD EXPOSURES OF NO 1 AS WELL AS BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE ESTUARY BEDS AT THE MOUTH OF THE JUDITH WE MUST AWAIT A MORE THOROUGH AND DETAILED EXPLORATION OF THIS REGION BEFORE WE CAN STATE WITH ENTIRE CONFIDENCE THE SUCCESSION OF THE BEDS IN DESCLIBING THE TERTIARY DEPOSITS IN THE NORTHWEST I SEPARATED THEM INTO TWO DIVISIONS BUT MORE RECENT INVESTIGATION HAS ADDED MANY NEW FACTS IN REGARD TO THEM AND RENDERED THE FOLLOWING DIVISIONS NECESSARY 1ST ESTUARY DEPOSITS 2D TRUE LIGNITE BEDS 3D WIND RIVER VALLEY DEPOSITS 4TH WHITE RIVER TERTIARY DEPOSITS THE ESTUARY DEPOSITS OF WHICH THE JUDITH BASIN MAY BE REGARDED AS THE TYPE ARE QUITE126 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY REMARKABLE AND OF A MOST INTERESTING CHARACTER OPINIONS OF A SOMEWHAT CONFLICTING NLA TURE HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINED IN REGARD TO THEM OWING TO THE PECULIAR CHARACTER OF THE ORGANIC REMAINS BUT RECENT OBSERVATIONS HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT THEY ARE ALL OF TERTIARY AGE AND THAT THEY ARE QUITE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE FAR WEST THE LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS OF THE JUDITH DEPOSIT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBED AND IT HAS YIELDED MANY IMPORTANT FOSSILS A THIN SERIES OF BEDS IS ALSO FOUND NEAR THE SOURCES OF THE MO REAU GRAND AND CANNONBALL RIVERS AND AT THE MOUTH OF THE BIG HORN RIVER WE HAVE A GROUP OF BEDS EIGHT HUNDRED TO OLLE THOUSAND FEET IN TLHICKNESS WITH FOSSILS OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS THOSE OCCURRING AT THE MOUTH OF THE JUDITH THE COLLECTIONS OBTAINED BY MR H ENGELMANN IN UTAH WHILE ACTING AS GEOLOGIST OF CAPT SIMPSONS EXPEDITION AND SUB SEQULENTLY INVESTIGATED BY MR MEEK HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED THE EXISTENCE OF AN ESTUARY DE POSIT OF TERTIARY AGE IN THE COUNTRY BORDERING UPON GREEN RIVERSCARCELY LESS INTERESTING THAN THAT OF THE JUDITH THESE DEPOSITS PASS UP INTO THE TRUE LIGNITE BEDS WITHOUT ANY PERCEPTIBLE LINE OF SEPARATION GRADUALLY LOSING THEIR ESTUARY CHARACTER AND EVER AFTER CON TAINING ONLY LAND AND FRESHWATER SHELLS THE LIGNITE STRATA ARE CHIEFLY REMARKABLE FOR YIELDING IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE FINELY PRESERVED VEGETABLE REMAINS A FEW FRAGMENTS OF LEAVES OF DICOTYLEDONOUS TREES AND SILICIFIED WOOD WITH VERY IMPURE LIGNITE BEDS ARE FORMED IN SOME OF THE ESTUARY DEPOSITS BUT NO GROUPS TO INDICATE THE GREAT LUXURIANCE OF VEGETATION WHICH MTUST HAVE EXISTED DURING THE ACCUMUILATION OF THE LIGNITE STRATA THE GEOGRAPHICAL EXTENSION OF THE LIGNITE DEPOSITS OF THE WEST IS NOW A MATTER OF THE HIGHEST INTEREST AND FROM WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN I AM CONVINCED THAT THEY WILL YET BE FOUND TO COVER A GREATER OR LESS AREA ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MAIN DIVIDE OF THE ROCKY MOTUN TAINS FROM THE ARCTIC SEA TO THE ISTHMUS OF DARIEN THE ESTUARY AND LIGNITE BEDS SEEM ALSO TO HAVE PARTAKEN EQUALLY WITH THE OLDER FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS OF THE INFLUENCE WHICH ELE VATED THE MOUNTAIN CHAINS ALONG THE LARAMIE MOUNTAINS AND FROM THE RED BUTTES TO THE DIVIDE BETWEEN PLATTE AND WIND RIVERS ALONG THE BIG HORN MOUINTAINS THE STRATA IN CLINE AT VERY HIGH ANGLES 40 TO 80 AND IN SOME INSTANCES ARE VERY NEARLY VERTICAL THE TRUE LIGNITE STRATA SEEM TO CONFORM TO THE OLDER FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS AND TO HAVE BEEN DIS TURBED BY THE SAME INFLUENCES THAT ELEVATED THE MOUNTAIN RANGES IN THE VICINITY THESE TERTIARY BEDS EXTEND OVER ALL THE PLAIN COUNTRY TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE LARAMIE MOUN TAINS FAR TO THE NORTHWARD BEYOND THE LIMITS OF OUR EXPLORATIONS CROSSING THE WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS WE FIND THEM LARGELY DEVELOPED HIGH UPON THE WESTERN SLOPE DIPPING AT A HIGH ANGLE FROM THE WIND RIVER RANLGE ON THE ONE SIDE AND THE WASATCH AND GREEN RIVER MOUNTAINS ON THE OTHER THROUGHOUT THE WIND RIVER VALLEY IS A SERIES OF BEDS OF GREAT THICKNESS WHICH SEEM TO BE INTERMEDIATE IN THEIR CHARACTER BETWEEN THE TRUE LIGNITE BEDS AND THE WHITE RIVER TER TIARY DEPOSITS WE FIRST OBSERVED THEM GENTLY INCLINED NEAR WILLOW SPRINGS ON THE NORTH PLATTE AND THENCE WVESTWARD TOWARD THE SWEETWATER MOUNTAINS AND NEAR THE DIVIDE BEOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 127 TWEEN THE NORTH PLATTE AND WIND RIVER THEY REACH A THICKNESS OF FOUR HUNDRED FEET FROM THIS DIVIDE THROUGHOUT THE WIND RIVER VALLEY THEY OCCUPY THE GREATER PORTION OF THE COUNTRY ANID THOUGH INCLINING IN THE SAME DIRECTION WITH THE OLDER STRATA THE BEDS DO NOT DIP MORE THAN 10 TO 5 THEY DIFFER FROM THE OTHER DEPOSITS IN THE GREAT PREDOMINANCE OF ARENACEOUS SEDIMENTS AND IN THE ABSENCE OF VEGETABLE REMAINS BUT THEY CONTAINI FRAG MENTS OF TURTLES AND NUMEROUS FRESHWATER AND LAND SHELLS OF THE GENERA HELIX PLANORBIS VIVIPARA C THE ENTIRE THICKNESS OF THESE DEPOSITS MAY BE ESTIMATED AT FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND FEET FROM THE FACT THAT THESE DEPOSITS DO NOT CONFORM TO THE TRUE LIGNITE BEDS AND THAT DETACHED PORTIONS ARE SEEN LYING UPON THE SIDES OF THE MOUN TAINS BUT SLIGHTLY INCLINED WHILE THE CORRESPONDING BEDS ARE SHOWN IN THE VALLEY BELOW WE INFER THAT THEY WERE ACCUMULATED LONG BEFORE THE MOUNTAINS WERE RAISED TO TLLEIR PRESENT HEIGHT OR PERHAPS DURING THE GRADUAL PROCESS OF ELEVATION THIS IS ESPECIALLY SHOWN AT THE UPPER END OF THE WIND RIVER VALLEY PASSING OVER THE WIND RIVER MOUN TAINS WE AGAIN SEE THEM HOLDING THE SAME POSITION ON THE WESTERLN SLOPE AND POSSESSING THE SAME LITHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS WHILE THE LIGNITE BEDS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE DIVIDE INCLINE AT A LARGE ANGLE THE MORE RECENT BEDS ALTHOUGH IN SOME PLACES OCCUPYING THE VERY CREST OF THE MOUNTAINS SELDOM INCLINE MORE THAN THREE TO FIVE DEGREES THE MOST INTERESTING ADDITIONAL FACTS WHICH WE HAVE OBTAINED IN REGARD TO THE WHITE RIVER TERTIARY BEDS ARE THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL EXTENSION AND THE EVIDENCE OF THEIR AGE IN RELA TION TO THE LIGNITE TERTIARY DEPOSITS WE CAN NOW SHOW BEYOND A DOUBT THAT THE FORMER MUST HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED LONG SINCE THE LATTER WE HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT THEY EXTEND SOUTHWARD ALONG THE LARAMIE MOUNTAINS TO WILLOW SPRINGS WITHIIN TEN MILES OF CACHE LA POUDRE THAT THEY ALSO EXTEND UP THE NORTH PLATTE TO THE BOX ELDER CREEK AND EVEN BEYOND ARE SMALL OUTLIERS SHOWING THAT MUCH HAS BEEN REMOVED BY EROSION PASSING OVER INTO THE LARAMIE PLAINS WE FIND AT THE SOURCE OF THE BOX ELDER AND EXTENDING OVER TO THE HEAD OF BATESS FORK A LARGE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TERTIARY AND IT ALSO REACHES FAR WESTWARD TO THE MEDICINE BOW MOUNTAINS WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE OBSERVATIONS OF DR HINES THAT IT OC CUPIES A CONSIDERABLE AREA AMONG THE SWEETWATER MOUNTAINS EXTENDING OVER INTO THE GREEN RIVER VALLEY WE HAVE ALONG THE NORTH PLATTE THE OVERLAPPING OF THE WHITE RIVER BEDS UPON THE LIGNITE STRATA THUS AFFORDING THE EVIDENCE OF SUPERPOSITION FOR THEIR RELATIVE AGE THE SAME FACT WAS NOTICED BETWEEN THE NORTH FORK OF THE SHYENNE AND THE HEAD OF CHERRY CREEK WHERE BEDS OF MARL AND LIMESTONE CONTAINING PLANORBIS LIMNEA C THE SAME AS ARE SEEN IN THE BAD LANDS PROPER REPOSE UPON TRUE LIGNITE TERTIARY STRATA AGAIN WHILE THE WHITE RIVER BEDS HOLD FOR THE MOST PART A HORIZONTAL POSITION THOSE OF THE LIGNITE TERTIARY ARE OFTEN MUCH DISTURBED NEAR THE BLACK HILLS THE FORMER SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ELEVATED TO A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT BY THE UPHEAVAL OF THE MOUNTAINS BUT THEY DO NOT IN ANY CASE INCLINE MORE THAN ONE DEGREE WHILE NORTH OF THE BLACK HILLS THE LIG128 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY NITE BEDS DIP FIVE TO TEN DEGREES ALONG THE PLATTE I HAVE SEEN THE FORMER INCLINING FIVE DEGREES ESPECIALLY ON LA BONTE CREEK AND ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES EAST OF THE MOUTH OF TLLAT CREEK OFTEN THE BEDS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN RAISED UP SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION WITHOUT INCLINATIOLU RESTING UPON THE UPTURNED EDGES OF THE LIGNITE BEDS WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED PARTOOK EQUALLY OF THE DISTURBING INFLUENCES WHICH HAVE GIVEN SO GREAT AN INCLINATION TO THE OLDER FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS ALONG THE BIG HORN MOUN TAINS AND THE NORTH PLATTE THE LIGNITE BEDS SOMETIMES INCLINE FROM THE FOOT OF THE MOUN TAILNS EIGHTY DEGREES AND OFTEN THE INFLUENICE OF THE ELEVATORY POWER HAS AFFECTED THEM FAR OUT INTO THE PLAIN COUNTRY IN THE ABOVE ACCOUNTS OF THE TERTIARY DEPOSITS OF THE WEST WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE OLDER MEMBERS ARE CLEARLY SEPARABLE INTO FOUR DIVISIONS EXCLUSIVE OF THE PLIOCENE DEPOSITS OF THE NIOBRARA LET US EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE IN REGARD TO THE AGE OF THESE DEPOSITS IF WE STUDY THE UPPER PORTIONS OF CRETACEOUS FORINATION NO 5 WHEN NOT REMOVED BY THLE ERO SIVE POWER OF WATER TO ANY GREAT EXTENT WE THEN OBSERVE FROM THE TIME WE PASS FROM NO 4 TO NO 5 A GRADUAL CHANGE IN THE SEDIMENTS AND OTHER INDICATIONS OF A SLOW APPROACH TO SHALLOW WATER ARENACEOUS SEDIMENTS BEGIN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF ARGILLACEOUS SO THAT WE HAVE ALTERNATE THIN LAYERS OF SAND AND CLAY THE SAND CONTINUING TO INCREASE UNTIL TILE UPPER PART BECOMES A YELLOW FERRUGINOUS COARSE SANDSTONE WITH MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLES OF RIPPLEMARK AND OBLIQUE LAMINAE AS THE WATERS OF THE CRETACEOUS SEA WERE GRADUALLY RE CEDING TOWARD THE ATLANTIC ON THE ONE SIDE ANLD TOWARD THE PACIFIC ON THE OTHER REMNANTS WERE LEFT IN THE FORM OF LAKES ESTUARIES C WHICH NOW AFFORD US THE LAST INDICATIONS OF MARINE AND BRACKISH WATER DEPOSITS IN THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE WEST IN THESE DEPOSITS WE HAVE FIRST A MINGLING OF BRACKISH AND FRESHWATER FORMS GRADUALLY PASSING UP TO PURE FRESHWATER AND TERRESTRIAL SPECIES WITH NO RETURN TO THE MARINE CONDITION AGAIN IN THE UPPER PART OF THE CRETACEOUS FORMATION NO 5 ON THE MOREAU WVE FIND THE OSTREA SUBTRIGONALIS AND IN THE JUDITH DEPOSITS A FORM OCCURS IN THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE WHICH IS UNDISTINGUISHABLE FROM IT WE HAVE ALSO MENTIONED THE FACT THAT THE FOSSILS OF THE UPPER PART OF NO 5 SEEM TO HAVE EXISTED UPON THE VERGE OF THE TERTIARY PERIOD THAT THEY SOMETIMES PRESENT PECULIAR FORMS MORE CLOSELY ALLIED TO TERTIARY TYPES THAN CRETACEOUS AND WERE IT NOT FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE GENERA BACULITES AMMTNONITES INOCERAMUS C WHICH ARE EVERYWHERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BECOME EXTINCT AT THE CLOSE OF THE CRETACEOUS EPOCH WE WOULD BE IN DOUBT WHETHER TO PRONOUNCE THEM TERTIARY OR CRETACEOUS THESE FACTS WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE A FORE SHADOWING OF THE TERTIARY ERA AND THAT THE TRANSITION FROM OLLE GREAT PERIOD TO THE OTHER WAS GRADUAL AND QUIET THE CHANGE IN THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS BEING ULTIMATELY SUFFICIENT TO DESTROY THE CRETACEOUS FAUNA AND BRING INTO EXISTENCE THAT OF THE TERTIARY AGAIN IN NUMEROUS LOCALITIES WHERE NO 5 IS FULLY DEVELOPED AND A LARGE THICKNESS OF TERTIARY DEOF THE UPPER MISSOURI 129 POSITS IS SUPERIMPOSED SO THAT NEAR SOME OF THE MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS I HAVE FOUND IT DIFFI CULT TO DRAW THE LINE OF SEPARATION NO APPARENT PHYSICAL BREAK OCCURRING IN THE SEDIMENTS WILL NOT THESE STATEMENTS GO FAR TO SHOW THAT THE ESTUARY DEPOSITS USHERED IN THE DAWN OF THE TERTIARY EPOCH AND INDUCE THE BELIEF THAT THEY BELONG TO THE FIRST PART OR EOCENE PERIOD  THIS POINT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE TO ESTABLISH ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEARING UPON THE HISTORY OF THE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR WESTERN CONTINENT THE ESTUARY DEPOSITS SOON LOSE THEIR MARINE AND BRACKISH CHARACTER AND GRADUALLY PASS UP INTO THE TRUE LIGNITE STRATA OF PURELY FRESHWATER ORIGIN THENCE BY A SLIGHT DISCORDANCY INTO THE WIND RIVER VALLEY BEDS WHICH GIVE EVIDENCE OF BEING AN INTERMEDIATE DEPOSIT BE TWEEN THE TRUE LIGNITE AND WHITE RIVER TERTIARY BEDS THEN COME THE WHITE RIVER BONE BEDS WHICH PASS UP INTO THE PLIOCENE OF THE NIOBRARA BY A SLIGHT PHYSICAL BREAK AND THE LATTER ARE LOST IN THE YELLOW MARL OR LOESS DEPOSITS I HAVE ESTIMATED THE ENTIRE THICKNESS OF TERTIARY ROCKS IN THE NORTHWEST AT FROM FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND FEET AND THEIR INTEREST WILL BE APPRECIATED WHEN I VENTURE TO SUGGEST THAT BY THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THEY WILL DOUBT LESS REVEAL STEP BY STEP IN A MOST REMARKABLY CLEAR MANNER THE HISTORY OF THE PHYSICAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THIS CONTINENT I SHALL TREAT THIS SUBJECT MORE FULLY IN A FUTURE PAPER AND WOULD REFER TO THE FORTHCOMING REPORT OF CAPT RAYNOLDS FOR THE DETAILS OF THE FACTS SUSTAINING MY OPINIONS WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE SO FAR AS I KNOW OF LONGCONTINUED DEEPWATER DEPOSITS IN THE WEST UNTIL FAR UP IN THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD IF WE EXAMINE THE POTSDAM SANDSTONE WE SHALL FIND THAT WHERE IT REACHES ITS GREATEST FORCE THE LOWER PORTION IS COMPOSED OF AN AGGREGATION OF QUARTZ PEBBLES CEMENTED WITH SILICIOUS MATTER AND AS WE PASS UPWARD WE FIND IT ARRANGED IN THIN LAYERS QUITE COMPACT WITH FUCOIDAL MARKINGS RIPPLEMARK C EVERYWHERE ARE MOST ABUNDANT EXAMPLES OF OBLIQUE LAMINA OF DEPOSIT AND RIPPLE AND WAVEMARKINGSEVIDENCES OF SHALLOW WATERS DURING THE LONG PERIOD THAT ELAPSED BETWEEN THE DEPOSITION OF THE EARLIEST PART OF THE SILURIAN EPOCH AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CARBONIFEROUS WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT DRY LAND PREVAILED OVER A LARGE PORTION OF THE WEST THE CARBONIFEROUS EPOCH COM MENCES WITH THIN LAYERS OF ARENACEOUS DEPOSITS GRADUALLY PASSING UP INTO HOMOGENEOUS SILICIOUS AND CALCAREOUS BEDS THE LATTER ARE NEVER MORE THAN FROM TWENTY TO FIFTY FEET IN THICKNESS AND THEN THE ARENACEOUS SEDIMENTS BEGIN AGAIN TO PREDOMINATE AND ALL THE PROOFS OF SHALLOW AS WELL AS TURBULENT WATERS ARE SHOWN WE THEN PASS UP THROUGH THE RED ARENACEOUS DEPOSITS AND JURASSIC BEDS AND FIND NO ROCKS THAT INDICATE DEEPWATER DE POSITION CRETACEOUS FORMATION NO 1 COMMENCES IN MANY PLACES WITH A CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS OF AN AGGREGATION OF WATERWORN PEBBLES PASSING UP INTO THIN ALTERNATE LAYERS OF ARENACEOUS AND ARGILLACEOUS SEDIMENTS WITH THICK BEDS OF SANDSTONE WITH RIPPLEMARKINGS AND OBLIQUE LAMINV THEN THESE INDICATIONS GRADUALLY CEASE IN NO 2 AND THROUGH NOS 2 3 VOL XII17130 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY AND 4 THE SEDIMENTS SHOW THAT THEY WERE ACCUMULATED IN COMPARATIVELY DEEP AND QUIET WATERS NO 2 IS A BLACK PLASTIC CLAY NO 3 GRAY MARL AND NO 4 A DARK INDURATED SOME TIMES LAMINATED CLAY WITH MANY CALCAREOUS CONCRETIONS IN NO 5 WE GRADUALLY APPROACH INDICATIONS OF SHALLOW WATER UNTIL DRY LAND APPEARS AS ALREADY STATED IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO MENTION IN DETAIL ALL THE OSCILLATIONS OF SURFACE AND OTHER PHYSICAL CHANGES TO WHICH WE HAVE REASON FOR SUPPOSING THE COUNTRY WAS SUB JECTED DURING ALL THESE PERIODS IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR PRESENT PURPOSE TO SHOW THAT EX CEPT DURING THE MIDDLE CRETACEOUS EPOCH NO LONGCONTINUED PERIODS OF QUIET WATER PREVAILED IN THESE ANCIENT WESTERN SEAS THE EVIDENCE APPEARS TO ME TO POINT TO THE CONICLUSION THAT A MUCH MILDER CLIMATE PRE VAILED THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN PORTIONS OF OUR CONTINENT DURING A GREATER PART OF THE TERTIARY PERIOD THAN THAT WHICH EXISTS IN THE SAME LATITUDES AT THE PRESENT TIME THE ORGANIC REMAINS APPEAR TO INDICATE A SUBTROPICAL CLIMATE OR ONE SIMILAR TO THAT OF OUR GULF STATES NEAR THE CLOSE OF THE CRETACEOUS EPOCH THE WATERS OF THE GREAT CRETACEOUS SEA RECEDED TOWARD THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE ATLANTIC ON THE ONE SIDE AND TOWARD THAT OF THE PACIFIC ON THE OTHER LEAVING LARGE AREAS IN THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE WEST DRY LAND THESE AREAS WERE OF COURSE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE SEA AND COMPARATIVELY BUT SLIGHTLY ELE VATED ABOVE THE OCEAN WATERS IN REGARD TO THE MOLLUSCA WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND QUITE ABUN DANTLY ENTOMBED IN THE LIGNITEBEARING STRATA IT IS AN INTERESTING FACT THAT THE MOST NEARLY ALLIED LIVING REPRESENTATIVES OF MANY OF THESE SPECIES ARE NOW FOUND INHABITING THE STREAMS OF SOUTHERN AFRICA ASIA CHINA AND SIAMI APPARENTLY INDICATING THE EXISTENCE OF A TROPI CAL CLIMATE IN THESE LATITUDES AT AS LATE A PERIOD AS THE TERTIARY EPOCH AGAIN THE LUXURIANCE OF THE FLORA WHICH HAS BEEN SO PERFECTLY PRESERVED IN THE LIGNITE STRATA OF THE WEST POINT TO THE SAME CONCLUSION IT IS TRUE THAT UNTIL RECENTLY NO FORMS HAVE BEEN FOUND WHICH BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO A TROPICAL VEGETATION BUT DURING OUR LAST EXPEDITION WE OBTAINED A SPECIES OF TRUE FAN PALM VERY CLOSELY ALLIED TO SABAL LAMONONIS FIGURED BY DR HEER IN HIS  FLORA TERTIARIA HELVETIW  THE MOST NORTHERN LIMIT OF PALMS IS THAT OF CHAMCEROPS PALMNETTO IN NORTH AMERICA IN LAT 3436 AND OF CLIANCEROPS HUNILIS IN EUROPE NLEAR NICE IN 430440 N LAT THE TRUE PALMS OF OUR PRESENT DAY ARE CONSIDERED AS HAVING THEIR NATIVE LAND WITHIN THE TROPICS THAT THIS OR A SIMILAR CON DITION OF CLIMATE CONITINUED THROUGHOUT THE ACCUMULATION OF THE WIND RIVER VALLEY DEPO SITS MAY BE INFERRED FROM THEIR MOLLUSCAN REMAINS WHICH ARE MORE NEARLY ALLIED TO TROPICAL FORMS AGAIN WE HAVE IN THIS REGION AS BEFORE MENTIONED A VAST AREA OCCUPIED BY THE LIGNITE BEARING STRATA THERE ARE FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY BEDS OF LIGNITE VARYING IN THICKNESS FROM  LINDLEYS VEGETABLE KINGDOM P 136I OF THE UPPER MISSOURI 131 ONE INCH TO SEVEN FEET OVER ALL THIS GREAT DISTRICT THERE ARE AT THE PRESENT TIME NO LARGE FORESTS NO TIMBER EXCEPT THAT WHICH SKIRTS THE STREAMS WE NOW KNOW THATDURING THE TERTIARY PERIOD VAST FORESTS OF TIMBER MUST HAVE COVERED MANY PORTIONS OF THE FAR WEST FROM THE ABUNDANCE AND VARIETY OF THE VEGETABLE REMAINS PRESERVED IN THE ROCKS SILICIFIED TRUNKS OF TREES FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED FEET IN LENGTH AND TWO TO FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER AND STUMPS WHICH INDICATE GIGANTIC FOREST TREES OCCUR ABUNDANTLY OVER HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES ALONG THE MISSOURI AND YELLOWSTONE RIVERS PROF HENRY AND OTHER METEOROLOGISTS HAVE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF WELLAUTHENTICATED FACTS THAT THE ABSENCE OF FOREST TREES ON THE GREAT PRAIRIES OF THE FAR WEST IS DUE TO THE WANT OF MOISTURE WHICH IS WELL KNOWN TO PREVAIL ALL ALONG THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THE PRE VAILING WINDS ARE NOW KNOWN TO COME FROM THE WEST AND AS THE CURRENTS OF AIR LADENED WITH MOISTURE FROM THE PACIFIC ASCEND THE WESTERN SLOPE OF THE MOUNTAINS BECOME CON DENSED AND DEPOSIT THEIR BURDENS FOR THE MOST PART BEFORE REACHING THE EASTERN SLOPE PROF HENRY IN HIS PAPER ON CLIMATOLOGY CONTRIBUTED TO THE PATENT OFFICE REPORT FOR 1856 SAYS  THE RETURN WESTERLY CURRENT SWEEPING OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND CONSE QUENTLY CHARGED WITH MOISTURE WILL IMPINGE ON THE COAST RANGE OF MOUNTAINS OF OREGON AND CALIFORNIA AND IN ASCENDING ITS SLOPES DEPOSIT MOISTURE ON THE WESTERN DECLIVITY GIVING FERTILITY AND A HEALTHFUL CLIMATE TO A NARROW STRIP OF COUNTRY BORDERING ON THE OCEAN AND STERILITY TO THE EASTERN SLOPE ALL THE MOISTURE HOWEVER WILL NOT BE DEPOSITED IN THE PASSAGE OVER THE FIRST RANGE BUT A PORTION WILL BE PRECIPITATED ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE NEXT UNTIL IT REACHES THE EASTERN ELEVATED RIDGE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN SYSTEM WHEN WE THINK IT WILL BE NEARLY IF NOT QUITE EXHAUSTED WE ARE NOW SUPPOSING THAT THE CLIMATIC CONDITIONSWINDS CURRENTS OF AIR C DID NOT DIFFER TO ANY GREAT EXTENT DURING THE TER TIARY EPOCH FROM THOSE WHICH PREVAIL IN THE SAME LATITUDES AT THE PRESENT DAY WE THERE FORE VENTURE THE SUGGESTION THAT UP TO THE TIME OF THE ACCUMULATION OF THE MIDDLE TERTIARY DEPOSITS THE LOFTY BARRIER OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS DID NOT EXIST CAHAPTER XIV MINERALS AND GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS I IGNEOUS AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS 1 GNEISS FERRUGINOUS  12 M NW FT LAR 2

OBTAINED OF THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION IN THE NORTH WEST THOUGH SEVERAL SPECIES WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN IN THAT COUNTRY ARE NOT INCLUDED FROM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT IN THE COLLECTION THE WOLVERINE GDTLO LUSCUS SABINE HAS BEEN KILLED IN THE VICINITY OF FORT BENTON AND IS NOT UNFREQUENTLY SEEN ALONG THE EASTERN BASE OF THE MOUNTAINS THOUGH NONE WERE OBSERVED BY OUR PARTY THE LITTLE

MOUNITAINS A FEW UNIOS ARE FOUND THE RIVERS THAT FLOW FROM THE NORTH JAMES VER MILION AND BIG SIOUX ABOTUND WITH UNIOIDCCE AND OTLHER FRESHWATER SHELLS VAST NUMBERS OF SHELLS ARE FOUNID IN THE ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS THROUGHOUT THE NORTHWEST IN THE BANK OF A LITTLE STREAM ABOUT TWO MILES BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE BIG SIOUX CALLED CLAY CREEK THERE IS A BED OF SHELLS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE BED

BUT THE ALLUVIAL SOIL COMPOSING THE BANKS OF THE LITTLE STREAMS IS FILLED WITH FRESH WATER AND LAND SHELLS FROM WHICH A NEW SPECIES HELIX COOPERI WAS DESCRIBED BY MR BINNEY THE FRESHWATER SHELLS WERE KINDLY EXAMINED BY MR LEA OF PHILADELPHIA AND IN REGARD TO THE ABOVE COLLECTION AND A SERIES OBTAINED BY MR KENNICOTT FROM THE RED RIVER OF THE NORTH MR LEA MADE THE FOLLOWINLG REMARKS BEFORE THE PHILADELPHIA ACADEMY IT IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT EITHER OF THESE COLLECTIONS MADE UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUM STANCES AND AT TIMES OF GREAT PERSONAL DANGER SHOULD BE FULL REPRESENTATIVES OF THIS BRANCH OF THE FAUNA OF THESE COUNTRIES BUT THEY ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THAT ZOOLOGICAL LIFE SO FAR AS REPRESENTED BY MOLLUSCS IS NEARLY IF NOT QUITE THE SAME AS THAT OF THE OHIO RIVER BASIN AS WELL AS THAT OF THE MISSOURI RIVER AND A PART OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI AND RED RIVER OF THE SOUTH THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PART OF THE SPECIES FROM THESE REMOTE DISTRICTS PROVES TO US THE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WE FIND EVERY ONE OF THEM IN THE OHIO RIVER AT CINCINNATI MARIETTA AND PITTSBURG AND THIS IS THE MORE REMARKABLE AS THE WATERS OF THE RED RIVER OF THE NORTH ARE EMBRACED IN A DIFFERENT SYSTEM OF DRAINAGE FLOW ING AS THEY DO INTO HUDSONS BAY AT ABOUT 52 NORTH LATITUDE HERE IS SEEN AN IMMENSE180 ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY AREA OF COUNTRY PRODUCING IN ITS WATERS NEARLY THE SAME

clude a large amount of valuable and original data il regard to a wide area of the Atlantic in the region of the Gulf Streamn and to the eastward of it including the  Sargasso Sea etc In Mr Dalls second paper he states that it appears that the wire uised  was of steel thonLgh this is not stated in the logbook As this is explicitly stated in the prinited report of LienLt Walsh it is possible that iMr Dall has not consulted the latter The following description of the wire and apparatus used is to be found on p 56 It is of interest to notice that this early apparatus was much like the modern improved machines in several respects Our arrangements for these deep soundings were altogether very complete It may be well to add ani account of them We had on board 14300 fathoms of wire weighing 3025 lbs all of the best Eniglish steel of five different sizes Nos 5 7 8 10 and 13 Birmingham gauges Every part was tested to bear at least onethird more than the weight which it was caleLclated to sustain  An extent of 7000 fathoms of this weighing 1800 lbs the remainiing 7300 fathoms composed of the smaller sizes Nos 10 and 13 being stowed away as spare wire carefully measured and inarked with smnall copper labels was linked ilnto one piece and wvound upon aln iron cylinder three feet in length and twenty inches in diameterthe largestsized wire beinig wound first so as to be uppermost in sounding Two swivels were placed near the lead anid one at each thousand fathoms to meet the danger of twisting off by the probable rotary motioin in reel ilig up The cylinder with the wire was fitted to a strong wooclen frame and machinery attached  fly wheel and pinions to give power in reeling up Four men at the cranks could reel up with ease with the whole weight of wire out Iron friction bands which proved of indispensable importance were con nected to reguLlate the rate of the wire in running off the reel One man with his hand upon the lever of one of these friction bands could preserve a uni form safe velocity checking or stoppinlg the wire as required The whole apparatus could be taken apart and stowed away in pieces being so large and mnas sive this was indispensable in so small a vessel as the Taney When wanted for use the frame was put together and secured to the deck by iron clamps anld bolts lnear amidships the reel hoisted up fromn below anid shipped in its place a fairleader was secured to the taffrail being a thick oak plank rigged out five feet over the stern having an iron puilley eighteen iniches diameter fitted in its outer end and two sheet iron fenders 31 feet long of semi circular shape fitted under it to guard the iron wire from getting a short nip in the drifting of the vessel The wire was led aft from the reel over the pulley which traversed freely in the fairleader and passed between these fenders into the water The time occupied in the descent of the 5700 fathoms at the molerate rate it was allowed to go off the reel using the friction bands was exactly 12 hours I found in the subsequent soundings see May 14 that two or three nmen could reel up 1000 fathoms in 21 hours taking time to rub dry and oil it in passing to the reel to guaird against rust In the trial referred to it is stated that a tenpound lead with a Stellwagen cup anlcl a sixpouncd instrument for ilndicating depth were attached to the wire The following account of this first use of the steel wire on Nov 14 1849 extractecd from the publislhed log of the Taney p 69 is of interest at the present time Lieut Walsh in this connection and elsewhere expressed great confidence in the accuracy of this determina tioln of depth though it has been regardcld by others perhaps without sufficient reason as unreliable At 1 h 25 m Pm started the wire machine and at 2 h 55 m PM had reeled off 5700 fathoTns dead up and down without striking bottom when the wire parted at one of the linlks on the reel We had observed some of the links of this large sized wire to catch at times on others upon the reel en dangering a break and in consequence at the timue it parted we were reeling off very slowly and care fully checking it by the friction band which worked admirably A link going off the reel caught in an other under it upon the reel and before it could be extricated it snapped in the middle of the link This was the largestsized wire No 7 The whole time of reeling off the wire went dlown perfectly plumb it served as an anichor to keep the vessel steady and there was at no time a variation of onehalf a degree from the plumb We were highly encouraged ex pecting to str ike bottom every moment and our sor row and disappointment upon the break and loss of the wire great indeed This locality was in N lat 31 59 W long 580 43 east of the Bermudas and not very far from the part of the Atlantic where the greatest depths known lhave subsequently been found But this particular region appar ently has not been reexamined If correct this sounding would be more than 1000 fath oms cleeper than any other that is authentic Lieut Walsh appears to have fully appreci ated the main cause of the several failures with the wire In all our suipsequent work under this head I found the heave of the sea however slight was the great difficultythe lifting of the stern in the pitch ing motion causing such an immense increase of strain upon the wire breaking it uipon almost every occasion onl reaching about 2000 fathoms Probably the use of heavier leads would have inereased the liability of the wire to break from this cause This trouble is reme died in the modern souLndingmachines by the use of vulcanized rubber springs or  ac cumulators which relieve the suddeni strains570 SCIENCE VOL I No 20 upon the wire Therefore there is no good reason to think that any thing would hlave been gained at that time by the use of heavy leads though Mr Dall thinks it strange that they were not tried In some of the trials a twelvepound lead was used and in the last attempt one of eight pounds together with a thermometer with the usual result  a break age of the wire Mr Dalls note implies that 1o successful trials were made with the steel wire but ac cording to the published log p 93 May 14 1850 at least one sounding was made 1050 fathoms no bottom when the wire was suc cessfully recovered A E VERRILL

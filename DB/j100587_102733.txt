J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,102733,A DISCOURSE OF THE VIPER AND SOME OTHER POYSONS WROTE BY SIR THEODORE DE MAYERNE AFTER SOME DISCOURSE HE HAD WITH MR PONTAEUS COMMUNICATED BY THE LATE SIR THEODORE DE VAUX M D AND F R S,I206887,IV A DISCOURSE OF THE VIPER AND SOME OTHER POY SONS WROTE BY SIR THEODORE DE MAYERNE AF TER SOME DISCOURSE HE HAD WITH MR PONTAEUS COMMUNICATED BY THE LATE SIR THEODORE DE VAUX M D AND F R S THE VENOM OF THE VIPER IN ITSELF IS NOT MORTAL TO A ROBUST AND SOUND BODY AND THO VERY UNHAPPY AND MISCHIEVOUS ACCIDENTS ATTEND IT AS A GREAT TUMOUR TENSION AND WEIGHT OF THE PART HUMIDITY AND VARIETY OF COLOURS PHRENSIES CONVULSIONS VOMITINGS YET IN EIGHT OR TEN DAYS AT MOST THESE ACCIDENTS ARE OVER AL THO THE PATIENT MAY BE VERY ILL YET HE RECOVERS AGAIN WHILST THE POYSON HAVING RUN THROUGH DIVERS PARTS OF THE BODY AT LAST IT ALWAYS THROWS ITSELF INTO THE SCRO TUM SWELLING IT EXTREAMLY CAUSES A GREAT HEAT AND QUANTITY OF URINE VERY HOT AND SHARP BY WHICH IT IS DISCHARGED THIS EVACUATION BEING THE ORDINARY AND MOST CERTAIN CRISIS OF THE DISEASE IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THE PERSPIRATION BEING OBSTRUCTED BY THE POYSON A MAN BIT BY A VIPER AND SWELLD UP IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS SHALL WEIGH ALMOST AS MUCH MORE AS HE DID BE FORE A460 A SICKLY PERSON UNDER AN ILL HABIT OF BODY OR FEAR FUL DYES INFALLIBLY IN A SHORT TIME OF THIS VENOME WITHOUT SPEEDY HELP IN THE EXTREME AND NERVOUS PARTS NEAR THE PULSE AND TONGUE THE BITES ARE DANGEROUS AND ACCIDENTS VERY PAINFUL FRESH VIPERS THAT HAVE NOT BIT BUT HAVE THE BLAD DERS OF THE GUMS FULL OF VENOM ARE THE MOST MIS CHIEVOUS MOUNTEBANKS TO IMPOSE UPON THE PEOPLE EITHER MAKE THEIR VIPERS BITE BEFORE THEY BRING THEM OUT OR WITH A NEEDLE SCRATCH THE GUMS AND PRESS OUT THE POYSON THEY MAKE US BELIEVE THAT A BITE ON THE LEFT BREAST NEAR THE HEART IS MORE MORTAL THAN ELSEWHERE BUT THIS IS A CHEAT IT CAUSING ONLY A GREAT SWELLING ON ALL THAT SIDE OF THE BODY ON THE NECK AND FACE WHICH AFTER WARDS FALLS DOWN AS WAS SAID INTO THE SCROTUM AND IS EVACUATED BY URINE FOR THESE GREAT AND PAINFUL SWELLINGS THE REMEDY IS TO DRINK THE DECOCTION OF MARRUBIUM OR THE POWDER TAKEN INWARDLY AND A FOMENTATION WITH A DECOCTION APPLYING THE REST ON THE PLACE ARISTOLOCKIA IS ALSO A STRONG AND POWERFUL ANTIDOTE AGAINST THE VIPER SO THAT IF ONE BE BIT ON THE TONGUE HE NEED ONLY TAKE A SLICE OF THIS ROOT HEAT IT AND APPLY IT AND IT GOES AWAY PONTAEUS A CHYMICAL MOUNTEBANK A NATIVE OF EN GLAND AND AN APOTHECARY BY TRADE FROM WHOM I HAD THE ABOVEMENTIONED OBSERVATIONS WAS ONE DAY ACCIDENTALLY BIT BY A FRESH VIPER ON HIS RIGHT WRIST HE THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM ONE OF THE GREAT EST PAINS HE SUFFERED WAS AN ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE TEN SION OF THE PALM OF HIS HAND HE COMPOSED HIS ANTIODE OF EXTRACT OF JUNIPER BERRIES DRAWN WITH A DECOCTION OF ROOTS OF ROUND ARI461 ARISTOLCCHIA OF SUCCISA MARRUBIUM ALBUM FLOWERS OF BRIMSTONE AND OF WHITE VITRIOL FOR POYSONS NOT CORROSIVE SUCH AS THOSE OF ANIMALS AND VEGETABLES AND EVEN FOR THE PLAGUE ITSELF WHICH HE BELIEVES HE CAN CURE BY THE SAME REMEDY HE MAKES USE OF NO VITRIOL BUT IF THE POYSON BE SUBLIMATE WHICH OF ITSELF EXCITES VOMITING HE ADDS VITRIOL NOT IN A PROPORTION TO VOMIT AS A DRACHM BUT ONLY A SCRUPLE OR HALF A DRACHM THE VOMITING BEING ASSISTED BY THE CORROSIVE POYSON ITSELF TO ENCREASE THE VALUE OF HIS ANTIDOTE WITH THE PEO PLE WHEN THE EXPERIMENT IS MADE ON DOGS TO THAT DOG WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE DYE OF THE BITE OF THE VIPER HE GIVES WITH THE ANTIDOTE A QUARTER OF A NUX VOMICA NOT POWDERED ONLY CUT IN BITS AND THE NEXT DAY THE DOG DYES IF IT WERE POWDERED THE DOG WOULD DYE IN HALF AN HOUR HE SAYS NUX VOMICA IS SO CALLED BY CONTRARIES FOR IT NEVER VOMITS BUT SHUTS UP THE STOMACH AND CON TRACTS THE NERVES BY ITS POYSON TO PRESERVE THE DOGS ALIVE YOU MUST GIVE THEM IN THE ANTIDOTE OR ANY THING ELSE 3 OR 4 GRAINS OF SUBLI MATE WHICH IMMEDIATELY SETS THEM A VOMITING AND SO SAVES THEM ALIVE HE OFFERS TO TAKE ALL SORTS OF POYSONS EVEN CORRO SIVES AFTER AN ORDINARY MEAL AND FOR A TRYAL OF SKILL HE REFUSES THEM NOT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH HE MUCH ESTEEMS MORSUS DIABOLI SUCCISA OR DEVILS BIT AGAINST ALL SORTS OF POYSONS HE LAUGHS AT THE POYSON OF A TOAD WHICH HE SAYS HAS NONE AT ALL NO MORE THAN A FROG AND AFFIRMS HE HAS EAT SEVERAL WITHOUT ANY MISCHIEF HIS SUGAR OR REMEDY FOR WORMS IN CHILDREN IS 15 GRAINS OF MERCURIUS DULCIS WITH FIVE GRAINS OF SCAMONY AND TWO OR THREE TIMES AS MUCH SUGAR MADE UP IN LO ZENGES HE462 HE SAYS THAT THIS DOSE WHICH IN FRANCE PURGES GROWN PERSONS DOES NOTHING IN ENGLAND ON THOSE ABOVE 15 YEARS OLD AND OUGHT TO BE AUGMENTED HIS MERCURIUS DULCIS IS MADE WITHOUT VITRIOL WHICH THO GOOD IS YET CORROSIVE HE TAKES ONLY ASHES WITH THE DECREPITATED SALT THE MANNER OF THE ACTING OF THE VIPERS POYSON IS THUS IN ABOUT 34 OF AN HOUR A SYNCOPE OR SWOONING SEIZES THEM WITH TREMBLING AND CONVULSIONS TINGLING OF THE EARS AND FREQUENTLY DEAFNESS FOR A MOMENT NEXT AS IT WERE A WHITE SAIL COMES AFORE THEIR EYES WHICH SOON VANISHES ON THE PLACE OF THE BITE A SWELLING RISES AT FIRST OF THE BIGNESS OF A PEA WHICH GROWS AS BIG AS A BEAN OR NUT AND ENCREASING ENLARGES ITSELF OVER THE NEIGHBOURING PARTS TO A VERY CONSIDERABLE TUMOUR AND STRETCHING OF THE FLESH WHICH GROWS AEDEMATROUS AND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE FALLS INTO THE SCROTUM AND LEAVES THE PART BLACK BLUE AND YELLOW IT MAKES AS IT WERE BAGS IN THE SKININFERREDINFERRED WHICH FEEL HEAVY WHEN YOU WALK AS IF FILLD WITH QUICKSILVER DO WHAT YOU WILL THE POYSON WILL HAVE ITS COURSE AND IS USUALLY THREE DAYS BEFORE IT COMES TO THE HEIGHTH AND AS LONG ABATING FOR THESE GREAT SWELLINGS AND STRETCHING OF THE PARTS A FOMENTATION AND CATAPLASM IS MADE WITH MARRUBIUM TAPSUS BARBATUS AND AGRIMONY THE GALL OF THE VIPER IS NO WAYS VENEMOUS AND PONTAEUS SAYS HE USUALLY GIVES IT WITHOUT ANY ILL EFFECT OR TROUBLE BUT ITS BITTERNESS ALL THE POYSON IS IN THE LIQUOR IN THE GUMS WHICH IS YELLOW LIKE OYL OF WHICH YOU MAY EASILY DISARM THE VIPER THE VIPER IS THE MOST VENEMOUS OF SERPENTS THE ASP IS BUT A SPECIES OF THE VIPER THE NAPELLUS IS A VERY DANGEROUS POYSON ACTING BY ITS ACRIMONY YOU MUST TAKE A GREAT QUANTITY OF IT IT BURNS THE THROAT EXTREMELY AS DOES ALLUM BUT IT IS CURED BY THE ANTI DOTE CRUDE463 CRUDE ANTIMONY DOES NOTHING IF ATTACKD BY THE ANTIDOTE THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS OF ALL POYSONS IS OPIUM OF WHICH HAVING GIVEN AN EXCESSIVE QUANTITY TO HIS SER VANT AT FIRST HE HAD CONVULSIONS THEN STRANGE VOMIT INGS NOT ABLE TO LET ANY THING GO DOWN INTO HIS STO MACH A SLEEPINESS FOLLOWD ALL WHICH TIME THEY KEPT HIM AWAKE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AT LAST ALL OF A SUDDEN HE GREW WELL AND CALLED FOR VICTUALS SUCCISA OR DEVILS BIT IS EXCELLENT FOR POYSONS ESPECI ALLY THE PLAGUE AND IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT IT IS SO POW ERFUL A SUDORIFIC THAT LAYING THE SICK PERSON WHETHER OF THE PLAGUE OR OTHER MALIGNANT FEVER ON A BED OF THAT HERB MODERATELY HOT HE SHALL SWEAT TILL THEY TAKE HIM OFF AND MUCH MORE IF HE DRINKS OF THE DECOCTION OR JUICE OF THE HERB WHICH IN SUMMER THEY TAKE ALL AND IN WINTER OF THE ROOT ONLY HE SAYS THAT FOR THE DROPSIE AFTER ALL OTHER THINGS ONE OF THE BEST REMEDIES IN THE WORLD IS TO TAKE MOR SUS DIABOLI AND PUT IT OVER THE FIRE IN A DRY KETTLE THAT IT MAY WET IT ONLY WITH ITS OWN JUICE AND OF THIS TO APPLY A QUANTITY TO THE BELLY AND REINS OF THE PATIENT COVERING HIM UP WARM AND SO PROVOKE SWEAT WHICH WILL COME AWAY IN GREAT QUANTITY AND MAY BE MAINTAINED ACCORDING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE PATIENT AND EXIGENCY OF THE CASE C C C C V A

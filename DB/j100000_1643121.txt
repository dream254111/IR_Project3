ACIDBASE EQUILIBRIUM THE importance of the maintenance on the part of the blood and tissue juices of a hy drogen ion concentration within certain nar row limits of variation has been established through the work of J S Haldane and L J Henderson Recent investigations have not only served to emphasize the importance that the organism should maintain a certain acid base equilibrium for its physiological life but have also shown that when the mechanism which regulates this equilibrium is interfered with so that the hydrogen ion concentration of the blood is increased and maintained for an adequate time the organism no longer functionates normally but becomes patholog ical in certain of its reactions It is not the object of this note to enter into a discussion of the factors concerned in main taining a normal acidbase equilibrium nor to discuss those pathological conditions in which a variation from the normal is fre quently observed The object is to call atten tion to the influence of the age of the organ ism in controlling the mechanism by which the acidbase equilibrium is kept within the bounds of normality Some years ago while conducting a series of experiments in which uranium nitrate was employed as the toxic agent to induce an acute nephritis the observation was made that this substance was more toxic for old animals than for young animals This variation in 1 MacNidep W deB On the Difference in the DECEMBER 28 1917N S VOL XLVI No 1200 degree of toxicity was expressed by the older animals becoming both albuminuric and gly cosuric at an earlier period following the use of uranium than was the case with the young animals Furthermore the quantitative out put in the urine of both albumin and glucose was greater in the old animals than in the young animals When the kidneys of these animals were studied histologically there was found to exist more evidence of kidney injury in the organs from old animals than in those from young animals In so far as the kidney was concerned in the reaction uranium was more toxic in an old animal than in a young animal In a later series of experiments2 in which the age of the animals was taken into account animals following an intoxication by uranium gave evidence of developing an acid intoxica tion much earlier than did the younger ani mals The experiments also demonstrated that the acid intoxication in the older animals was of a severer degree than in the young ani mals The evidence for the development of an acid intoxication in these animals of different ages consisted in noting the time of appear ance and quantitative output in the urine of acetone bodies and in determining the rela tive degree of tolerance for an alkali by the two groups of animals The old animals showed an earlier appearance in the urine of acetone bodies a greater quantitative output of these bodies and a greater tolerance for an alkali than did the younger animals In these experiments it was furthermore shown that by the intravenous use of an alkali in a young animal the kidney could be success fully protected against the toxic effect of an anesthetic while in the older animals the diffi culty of furnishing this protection increased with the age of the animal Response of Animals of Different Ages to a Con stant Quantity of Uranium Nitrate Proc Soc Exp Biol and Med Vol XI 159 1914 2 MacNider W deB The Inhibition of the Toxicity of Uranium Nitrate by Sodium Carbon ate and the Protection of the Kidney Acutely Nephropathic from Uranium from the Toxic Ac tion of an Anesthetic by Sodium Carbonate Jour Exp Med Vol XXIII 171 1916 In a recent study3 of the relative toxicity of uranium nitrate in animals of different ages the observation has been made that the old animals not only show a severer grade of acid intoxication as indicated by the appear ance of acetone bodies in the urine than do the younger animals but these old animals also show a more marked increase in the hy drogen ion concentration of the blood which is associated with a more rapid depletion of the alkali reserve of the blood and a greater re duction in the tension of alveolar air carbon dioxide Associated with this change in the acidbase equilibrium of the blood there de velops a kidney injury which is histologically more marked in the old animals than in the young animals In a final series of experiments4 it has been found possible to maintain in some measure the functional capacity of the kidney and the response of this organ to various diuretic sub stances by employing a solution of sodium carbonate to restore the alkali reserve of the blood and maintain an acidbase equilibrium of the blood which approaches in degree the reaction of normality The ease with which the acidbase equilibrium of the blood can be restored and maintained in an animal intoxi cated by uranium and the degree of protection which is furnished the kidney is dependent upon the animals age The acidbase equi librium is more easily restored and can be maintained for a longer time in a young ani mal than in an old animal The protection of the animal against the toxic effect of uranium is more perfect in a young animal than in an old animal From the experiments which have been cited it would appear that there is a definite association between the toxic effect of uranium and its ability to induce an acid intoxication s

erection of the buildings is now in progress A temporary magnetic ob servatory equipped with the Eschenhagen magnetograph is in operation at Baldwin Kansas Sites for the magnetic observatories in Alaska and Hawaiian Islands will also soon be selected and the erection of the necessary buildings will begin within a year At certain specified times simultaneous observations at present simply of declination are made by all the magnetic parties in which important work beginning with September various universities distributed over the entire country will cooper ate Magnetic Observatory at Tacubaya Mexico Senor Moreno sends us the following informa tion  In the beginning of last year having finished our magnetic department we installed the apparatus and began taking observations in March A little later we were obliged to take out the apparatus on account of the excessive humidity which appeared in two of the subter ranean rooms After the rainy season had passed some provisions were made to prevent the recurrence of dampness in the future and we were successful to the extent that the two rooms mentioned are entirely dry On the 5th of February of this year we began anew our ob servations with three direct reading instru ments  JENNER INSTITUTE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE THE annual general meeting of the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine was held at Chelsea on June 29th last under the chairman ship of Lord Lister Among those present were Sir Joseph Fayrer SurgeonGeneral Hooper Professor Greenfield Professor Simpson Dr McCrury Dr Bridgwater Colonel Addison and Mr Shattock The governing body re ported that the transference of Lord Iveaghs gift for the promotion of the objects of the Insti tute had been effected and a governing body which would in future control its affairs had been constituted The Director Dr Allan Macfadyen reported satisfactory progress in  From the British Medical Journal the work of the Institute during the past year The fitting up of the Institute buildings with the exception of the museum was now com pleted Among other additions during the year were a physiological room a room for incubat ing purposes and a coldstorage room Mr Briggs had presented a Hansen apparatus for yeast culture and considerable additions had been made to the library The second volume of the Transactions contained nineteen contributions and included a paper by Professor Ehrlich Three papers had been communi cated to the Royal Society on the influence of the temperature of liquid air and hydrogen upon bacterial life The experiments were con ducted with the kind cooperation of Professor Dewar and a further series was contemplated In conjunction with Dr Morris and Mr Row land a paper has been submitted to the Royal Society on Expressed Yeastcell Plasma Buch ners  Zymase  and the research had discov ered a new method for triturating organisms Systematic investigations were being carried out in the bacteriological department upon en teric fever tuberculosis and the etiology of cancer with the cooperation of Dr Hewlett and Mr Rowland Various investigations had been published during the year by Dr Hewlett and other members of the staff It was pro posed to set on foot a systematic inquiry into the nature and origin of food poisons A num ber of workers had utilized the laboratories for purposes of research during the year Special investigations had been carried out for public authorities during the year on tubercle in milk on glanders and anthrax and other subjects The illustrations for the Transactions had been prepared by Mr J E Barnard in the photo graphic department of the Institute Dr Harden chemist to the Institute was continu ing his investigations on the chemical products of pathogenic and other microorganisms Dr Harris Morris lecturer on Technical Mycology reported that a number of students had made use of the Hansen Laboratory and that re searches on yeasts diastases zymase and other subjects of technical interest had been prose cuted Dr George Dean of the antitoxin de partment had made experiments on the best conditions for obtaining powerful toxins and 153154 SCIENCE antitoxins and the results of other workers had been tested as a result a higher average of antitoxic value had been reached Several races of streptococcus pyogenes had been used in immunizing horses with the view of obtain ing a polyvalent serum Researches dealing with problems of immunity were in progress and papers had been published in the diph theria bacillus and a new pathogenic strepto thrix THE BRITISH NATIONAL PHYSICAL LABORATORY A DEPUTATION of prominent English men of science waited on the financial Secretary of the Treasury Mr Hanbury M P on June 5th with the object of securing a site in the Old Deer Park Richmond for the new National Physical Laboratory Another deputation had an interview with Mr Hanbury a few days before to protest against the proposed buildings as an interference with the amenities of Kew Gar dens and it was to meet their objections that the present deputation waited upon Mr Han bury Amongst those present were Lord Lis ter Lord Rayleigh Lord Kelvin Sir Courtney Boyle Sir John Wolfe Barry Sir M Foster MP Sir E Carbutt Sir N Barnaby Sir Andrew Noble and Professors Riicker Clifton Schuster Fitzgerald and Elliott According to the report in the London Times Lord Lister said the Royal Society was deeply interested in the question of the new National Physical Laboratory and they were supported by all the scientific bodies in the kingdom Lord Rayleigh as Chairman of the National Physical Laboratory said they recommended That the institution should be established by extending the Kew Observatory in the Old Deer Park Richmond and that the scheme should include the improvement of the existing buildings at some distance from the present observatory They had already the Kew Ob servatory which had been doing very valuable work cognate to that proposed to be undertaken by the new institution and that alone sug gested the Deer Park as a natural site Be sides there were very few sites that were likely to be at all suitable because the char acter of the work to be carried out was of the N S VOL XII No 291 kind to be removed from all kinds of mechan ical and electrical disturbances Electrical dis turbance was a new feature but one that might be made from tramways anywhere On that ground no private site could meet the case because there was no security from buildings of other kinds creating mechanical and electrical disturbances This consideration greatly limited their choice of sites for this laboratory That princi ple was recognized by the Greenwich Observa tory being placed in the middle of a park the German institution at Potsdam was in a park and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures stood in the park of Sevres In a public park they had some guarantee that the buildings would be free from electrical and other disturbances Some comment had been made on the provisional arrangement with the woods and forests as to the 15 acres required One of the reasons for that large area being taken was that they wanted one of their build ings to be at a considerable distance from the other It had never been proposed to cover the whole 15 acres with buildings The actual area proposed to be covered with buildings was only a quarter of an acre or the 60th part of the whole area proposed to be taken Sir John WolfeBarry said that he was placed on the committee which recommended this site for the laboratory as the representative of ap plied science numbering 9000 members and the general opinion was that it was extremely important to establish this physical laboratory from the point of view of the trade of this country and the huge commercial interests at stake The committee gave the greatest pos sible attention to the question of site and they came to the conclusion that Kew was very suit able The one thing they had in view was quiet and Kew possessed advantages which could not be given at any other place within a reasonable distance of London It was easily accessible and it was quiet They wanted a good space because they did not want the public to approach too near Mr Hanbury in reply said I hope the deputation are under no misapprehension what ever as to our strong desire that this scheme for a physical laboratory should be carried out

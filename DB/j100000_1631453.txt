investiga tion is now beginning and may be the main subjeet of physiGal researeh during the next generation But here if we aeeept the theorsetiGal result of Professor J J Thomson we meet with the difBGulty that these entities ean not travel with a greater speed than that of light Under these eir GUmstanGes nothing seems left for us in the present state of our knowledge but to turn over to our sueeessors the problem of explaining the phenomena The main point I desire to bringout in this review is the tendeney whiGh it shows towards unifieation in physiGal researeh Heretofore differentiationthe subdivision of workers into a Gontinually inereasing number of groups of speeialistshas been the rule Now we see a Goming together of what at first sight seem the most widely separated spheres of aetivity What two branehes Gould be more widely separated than that of stellar statisties embraGing the whole universe within its seope and the study of these newlydis Govered emanations the produet of our laboratories whiGh seem to show the exist enee of Gorpuseles smaller than the atoms of matter  And yet the phenomena whiGh we have reviewed espeeially the relation of terrestrial magnetism to the solar aetivity and the formation of nebu lous masses around the new stars ean be aeGounted for only by emanations or forms of foree having probably some similarity with the Gorpuseles eleetrons and rays whiGh we are now produeing in our labora tories The nineteenth eentury in pass ing away points with pride to That it has done It has beeome a word to symbolize what is most important in human progress Yet perhaps its greatest glory may prot to be that the last thing it dia was to lay a foundation for the physiGal seienee of the twentieth eentury What shall be diseovered in the new fields is at present as far without our ken as were the modern developments of eleetriGity without the ken of the investigators of one hundred years ago We ean not guarantee any speeial diseovery What lies before us is an il limitable field the existenee of whiGh was seareely suspeeted ten years ago the ex ploration of whiGh may well absorb the aetivities of our physiGal laboratories and of the great mass of our astronomiGal ob servers and investigators for as many gen erations as were required to bring elee triGal seienee to its present state We of the older generation ean not hope to see more than the beginning of this develop ment and ean only tender our best wishes and most hearty Gongratulations to the younger sehool whose funetion it will be to explore the limitless field now before it S NEWCOMB PLANg OF TZE NEW BUILDINGS FOR THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS THE work for whiGh the National 13ureau of Standards was established ineludes re seareh and testing in the domain of phys ieS extending into the field of ehemistry on the one hand and of engineering on the other The union of researeh and testing in one institution is of supreme impor tance the investigations being of Gourse primarily designed to earry the work of standardization and testing to the high est possible efEeieney The Physikaliseh Technisphe ReiGhsanstalt is an illustrious example before all the world of how muGh ean be aeGomplished where researeh and testing are Gombined in one institution and that the union should be intimate is further shown by the faet that more or less researeh is earried on in the seGond or teehniGal division of the ReiGhsanstalt instead of being Gonfined to the first  A paper read before the Philosophical Society of VVashington

meehanieal plant instrument shop and laboratories for the heavier kinds of experiluental work where Gonsiderable power or large eleetrie cur rents are required These two buildings are to be united by a spaGious tunnel through whiGh air duets steam gas and water pipes and eleetrie eireuits are to be earried from the meehanical to the physieal laboratory The meehaniGal laboratory was begun last July and rill Gost about 125000 ineluding the heating and venti lating plant The physiGal building will cost about 200000 exclusive of equipment and ineluding the conneeting tunnel 2 Considerable progress has already been made in proGuring an equipment of apparatus tools and maGhines In addi tion to the fifteen rooms in the U S Coast and Geodetie Survey buildings occupied by the bureau last year a large fourstory residenee at 235 New Jersey Avenue SE has reeently been leased and equipped as a temporary instrument shop and labora tory A small briek building in the rear has been Gonverted into an engine and dynamo room and in the basement of the house a storage battery room and a second dynamo room the latter for a distributing switehboard and experimental alternators have been fitted up A storage battery of 132 eells of 200 ampere hours eapaGity furnishes power for eurrent and lighting and experimental purposes A low volt age battery giving 1000 amperes and two high voltage batteries of 1000 eells eaeh have also been provided During the past year the direetor and two other offieers of the bureau Drs Wolff and Waidner have visited the prineipal government laboratories and instrument makers of Europe The instrument shop is well division whiGh is espeeially the division of researeh At the very outset the director oE the Bureau of Standards realized the advan tages of this intimate assoeiation of re seareh and testing and no attempt was made or will be made to separate them into two divisions The laboratory re quirements are therefore those of a research laboratory plus whatever speeial facilities may be needed for commereial testing In addition to the workers them selves there is then required 1 A suit able plaGe in whiGh to work 2 an equip ment of apparatus tools and machines and 3 faGilities and applianees for pro viding the proper Gonditions for experi mental work To meet these requirements Congress has already authorized the expenditure of 25000 for a site 325000 for buildings and 40000 for equipment Further ap propriations for equipment and personnel will be made as needed The site lies in the northwestern suburbs of Washington about three and one half miles from the Treasury and 1000 feet from Conneetieut Avenue just north of Cleveland Park It is 350 feet above the Potomae and is the highest ground in that vicinity Complete freedom from the jarring of street traffie is assured and magnetie disturbanees due to the only eleetrie railway in that immediate region will be very slight 1 Two buildings have been planned one of whiGh is now under Gonstruction the plans for the other are completed and its Gonstruetion will soon begin The larger of the two whiGh is ealled the physiGal building will provide for that part of the experimental work which ought to be kept free frotn tneehaniGal and magnetic disturbances and to this end wil contain scarcely any machinry  ItsolENaE 131 JANUARY 23 1903 equipped with motordriven machines and hand tools and two mechanicians and a carpenter are now at work The ap paratus and machinery now in use in the temporary quarters is a part of the per manent equipment of the new buildings A considerable sum of money will of course be needed to complete the equip ment 3 The acilities and appliances for carrying on an experiment under the proper conditions are more difficult to secure than the apparatus itself In gen eral laboratory rooms should be well lighted and ventilated and their tem perature should be under control The windows should be double in order that the space near the windows often the most valuable in the laboratory may be warmer in cold weather and cooler in warm weather and freer from drafts of airs than would be the case with single windows It should be possible quickly and con veniently to darken many if not all the rooms The temperature of the laboratory should be automatically controlled by thermostats so tha1t any temperature within certain limits which may be re quired by a particular experiment or in vestigation may be maintained both day and night if necessary for any desired period The humidity of the air should be low so that moisture developed in the room either by respiration or evaporation may be absorbed by the air and carried away instead of depositing on the walls and furniture of the room and ap paratus These last considerations the control of the temperature and humidity of the air are vital Many kinds of work can ordinarily be done only in the winter months because summer temperature and summer humidity can not be controlled This involves not only long delays but perhaps a large amount of extra labor This is perhaps oftenest the case in elec trical work but in many other instances it is equally important Apparatus tools and machines often suffer by rusting in sum mer in spite of the fact that the attendant mea to be careful Hence in a labora tory shere work is to be carried on during the entire year and where a large quantity of valuable apparatus and instruments of precision are in use and where in addi tion valuable apparatus is to be received from outside ifor testing the necessity of controlling the humidity as well as the temperature of the room is evident The temperature of a room may be automatically controlled by means of a thermostat using either steam or hot air for heating Hot air however possesses three important advantages over steam In the first place steam pipes occupy valu able space in a laboratory usually near the windows or along the walls there appa ratus or benches would otherwise be placed If they are of iron their lnagnetization by the earth s field changes with their temperature and since the temperature of the room is regulated automatically by shutting off and readmitting the steam this causes frequent and annoyin changes in the magnetic Seld within the room In the second place heating by air affords the best possible ventilation which is apt to be insufficient in a steamheated building And in the third place heating by air ell ables the temperature to be automatically controlled in the summer as well as in winter if facilities are provided for cool ing the air and at the same time the hu midity may be controlled by partially drying the air The air of an unventilated laboratory soon becomes saturated wth moisture due to respiration and evapora tion and if it be ventilated by allowing hot moist air from without to enter the humidity rises as the temperature falls132 SCIENCE N S Vo XVII No 421 and the air is unable to earry away mois ture generated in the laboratory In heating a building by the double duct system hot air from one duct is mixed with cooler tempered air from a second duct in suth proportions as to hold the temperature of the room constant the proportions of the hot and tempered air being regulated by a pair of dampers the latter being automatically controlled by means of a thermostat Each room of a building therefore has its own sup ply flue regulating datpers arld ther mostat The latter may be set at any de sired temperature within the range of the apparatus If now in hof weather the hotair duct of winter carries air taken from out of doors say at 90 F and the temperedair duct carries artificially cooled air say at 60 a mixture of the two may give a room temperature of 75 when the temperature would otherwise be 80 or 85 And the thermostat will ad just automatically the proportions of cooled and uncooled air so as to hold this temperature constant thus preventing the usual gradual increase of temperature as the day progresses By a readjustment of the thermostat any other constant tem perature can be secured provided it is within the range of the system Not only will this system make possible automatic temperature control in summer a most important end in itself but it will also secure a humidity control lfor by cooling air its moisture is partly re lnoved and by lowering its temperature to the freezing point it is very largely re moved In order to remove as much mois ture as possible it is intended to overcool the air and then partly warm it up again and this may be done economically by means of a heat exchanger z e air on its way to the cooling chamber gives up heat through a thin metal wall to the overcooled air coming from the cooling ehamber a given refrigerating capacity will thus re move the maximum quantity of moistureP so that the pereentage humidity of the air may be no greater at the lower room tem perature than under normal eircum stances it would be at the higher tem perature With this system of heating in winter and cooling in summer with automatie temperature control the year round with e2rcess of moisture simultaneously removed by refrigeration and dust from the fresh air taken out by filters the double windows of the laboratory will be kept tightly closed in summer as in winter and an at nosphere favorable for experimentation may at any time be secured The closeci double windows will also effeetually keep out dust and dirt two of the enemies o the experimentalist With gas compressed air vacuum hot and cold water iee water and distilled water

PHOSPHATES AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID BY THOMAS GRAHAM ESQ MA FRSE PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY IN THE ANDERSONIAN UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW COMMUNICATED BY EDWARD TURNER MD FRS 8C RECEIVED JANUARY 29 READ JUNE 19 1833 I OF THE SUBSALTS INO CLASSES OF SALTS HAVE MORE LIBERALLY REWARDED INVESTIGATION THAN THE ARSE NIATES AND THE PHOSPHATES WITNESS THE DISCOVERY OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PHOS PHATES OF LIME BY BERZELIUS THE OBSERVATION OF THE IDENTITY OF FORM OF THE CORRESPONDING ARSENIATES AND PHOSPHATES BY MITSCHERLICH AND THE DOCTRINE OF ISOMORPHISM TO WHICH THAT OBSERVATION LED THE DISCOVERY BY THE SAME CHEMIST OF TWO BIPHOSPHATES OF SODA AGREEING IN COMPOSITION BUT DIFFERING IN FORM AND LASTLY THE DISCOVERY OF THE PYROPHOSPHATES BY MY FRIEND AND TOWNSMAN MR CLARK MUCH HOWEVER STILL REMAINS TO BE DONE TO COMPLETE THE HISTORY OF THESE INTERESTING SALTS 1 SUBARSENIATE AND SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA THE EXTRAORDINARY DISPOSITION OF ARSENIC AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS TO FORM SUBSES QUISALTSSUCH AS THE BROWN ARSENIATE AND THE YELLOW PHOSPHATE OF SILVER THE COMMON SUBARSENIATES OF LIME LEAD CIS WELL KNOWN CORRESPONDING ALKA LINE SALTS EXIST WHICH MERIT THE CONSIDERATION OF CHEMISTS TO A STRONG SOLUTION OF ARSENIATE OR PHOSPHATE OF SODA ADD A SOLUTION OF CAUSTIC SODA TILL THE LIQUOR FEELS SOAPY BETWEEN THE FINGERS AT LEAST HALF AS MUCH SODA AS ALREADY IN THE SALT MUST BE ADDED BUT AN EXCESS OF ALKALI IS NOT INJURIOUS CONCENTRATE THE LIQUOR TILL A PELLICLE FORMS ON ITS SURFACE AND THEN ALLOW THE SOLUTION TO COOL AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 150 TUFTS OF SLENDER PRIS MATIC CRYSTALS APPEAR IN IT THESE RAPIDLY INCREASE IN QUANTITY AND FINALLY FILL THE VESSEL THE CRYSTALS MUST BE DRAINED AS WELL AS POSSIBLE AND THE MOTHER LIQUOR MAY BE THROWN AWAY AS IT CONTAINS LITTLE ELSE THAN THE EXCESS OF CAUSTIC SODA AND THE SOLUBLE IMPURITIES OF THE SALTS IT IS NECESSARY WITHOUT LOSS OF MDCCCXXXIII 2 LMR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES TIME TO REDISSOLVE THE CRYSTALS IN TWICE THEIR WEIGHT OF HOT WATER TO FILTER THE SOLUTION THROUGH PAPER AND TO RECRYSTALLIZE BOTH SALTS CRYSTALLIZE READILY AS THEIR SOLUTIONS COOL IN THE FORM OF SIXSIDED PRISMS WHICH ARE GENERALLY SLENDER THE PRISM IS OFTEN TERMINATED BY A FLAT SURFACE WHICH APPEARS TO BE A RIGHT SECTION THE ANGLES OF THE CRYSTALS WERE NOT MEASURED BUT TWO OF THEM ARE MUCH MORE OBTUSE TIHANR THE REMAINING FOUR THE SUBARSENIATE MAY BE PROCURED IN CRYSTALS OF LARGER SIZE THAN THE SUBPHOSPHATE BUT OF THE SAME FORM THESE SALTS IN THE CRYSTALLINE FORM ARE NOT ALTERED BY EXPOSURE TO THE AIR BUT IN SOLUTION THEY ABSORB CARBONIC ACID AND WHEN AGAIN CRYSTALLIZED A PORTION OF CARBONATE IS FOUND TO ADHERE PERTI NACIOUSLY TO THE CRYSTALS IT IS EASY HOWEVER TO PRODUCE FINE CRYSTALS BY THE PROCESS DESCRIBED FREE FROM CARBONIC ACID AND APPARENTLY PURE A SOLUTION OF THE SUBARSENIATE IS PRECIPITATED EXACTLY NEUTRAL BY AN EXCESS OF FUSED NITRATE OF SILVER THE BROWN SUBARSENIATE OF SILVER FALLING DOWN WHICH PROVES THE ALKALINE SUBARSENIATE TO BE IN THE SAME STATE OF NEUTRALITY AS THE METALLIC SUBARSENIATE AND CONSEQUENTLY OF A SIMILAR CONSTITUTION THE SUB PHOSPHATE GIVES WITH THE SAME REAGENT THE YELLOW SUBPHOSPHATE OF SILVER AND LEAVES A LIQUID EITHER NEUTRAL OR VERY FAINTLY ALKALINE BY THE MOST SENSIBLE CUD BEAR PAPER THE ALKALINITY HOWEVER MUST BE ACCIDENTAL AS IT DISAPPEARS ON THE ADDITION OF THE SMALLEST QUANTITY OF ACETIC ACID THESE SALTS THEREFORE RANK AS SUBSESQUISALTS CONTAINING ONE PROPORTION AND A HALF OF BASE TO ONE OF ACID THEY ARE INTERESTING AS THE ONLY KNOWN SOLUBLE SALTS OF THAT CONSTITUTION THE SUBPHOSPHATE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CRYSTALLIZED BY DR DALTON AND RECOM MENDED AS A REAGENT BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN TWICE AS MUCH SODA AS THE COMMON PHOSPHATE MITSCHERLICH ALSO INFERS THE EXISTENCE OF A SUBSES QUIPHOSPHATE OF SODA FROM THE QUANTITY OF CARBONIC ACID EXPELLED WHEN PHOS PHATE OF SODA IS CALCINED WITH CARBONATE OF SODA THE SAME SALT APPEARS LIKE WISE TO HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF DR THOMSON AS AN ACCIDENTAL PRODUCT BUT IS DESCRIBED AS A CARBONOPHOSPHATE OF SODA BEING PROBABLY IMPURE IN REGARD TO THE PROPERTIES OF THESE SALTS THEY ARE STRONGLY ALKALINE TO THE TASTE AND ACT UPON CHLORINE AND IODINE LIKE FIREE ALKALIES INDEED THE EXCESS  THREE ATOMS OXYGEN IN THE BASE FOR FIVE ATOMS OXYGEN IN THE ACID T MANCHESTER MEMOIRS NS VOL III P 12  ANNALES DE

RHOMBOIDAL PHOSPHATE OR ARSENIATE AFTERWARDS APPEARS ON CRYSTAL LIZING WHEN THE PURE CRYSTALS ARE THROWN INTO NEUTRAL NITRATE OF AMMONIA THE VOLATILE ALKALI IS DISENGAGED AT 60 FAHR 100 PARTS WATER

ALTHOUGH MORE FUSIBLE THEY ARE LESS SOLUBLE THAN THE CRYSTALS OF SUBARSENIATE IT IS A FACT OF EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST THAT THE ACID OF THIS SUBPHOSPHATE IS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO PYROPHOSPHORIC ACID BY THE ACTION OF HEAT UPON THE SALT LIKE THE ACID OF THE CONMON PHOSPHATE OF SODA INDEED WHEN THE PYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA ITSELF IS CALCINED WITH AN EXCESS OF CARBONATE OF SODA CARBONIC ACID IS EXPELLED AND THE FORMER SALT PASSES ENTIRELY INTO SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA WHICH CRYSTALLIZES IN THE USUAL FORM AND CONTAINS NOT PYROPHOSPHORIC BUT PHOSPHORIC ACID THIS CHANGE TAKES PLACE EQUALLY WELL ALTHOUGH BOTH THE CARBONATE AND PYROPHOS PHATE BE MADE ANHYDROUS BEFORE BEING CALCINED AND WE CAN OBTAIN CONSE QUENTLY AN ANHYDROUS SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA A SOLUTION OF PYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA TO WHICH SUFFICIENT CAUSTIC SODA OR CARBONATE OF SODA HAS BEEN ADDED CANNOT BE EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS WITHOUT BECOMING SUBPHOSPHATE BUT PYRO PHOSPHATE OF SODA MAY BE BOILED WITH CAUSTIC SODA FOR HOURS WITHOUT SENSIBLE ALTERATION PROVIDED THE SOLUTION IS NOT EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS AND IT CRYSTAL LIZES AFTERWARDS IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM EXHIBITING NO DISPOSITION WHATEVER TO FORM A SUBPYROPHOSPHATE I MAY PREMISE THUS EARLY THAT THE PRECEDING FACTS AND MANY OTHERS TO BE AFTERWARDS ENUMERATED APPEAR TO BE MOST EASILY EXPLAINED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PHOSPHORIC ACID IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO PYROPHOSPHORIC IS CHARACTERIZED BY A DISPOSITION TO UNITE WITH THREE ATOMS OF BASETHAT COMMON PHOS PHATE OF SODA FOR INSTANCE IS A PHOSPHATE OF SODA AND OF WATER AND THAT ITS SYMBOL IS N A2 IP NOW FOR THIS BASIC WATER AN ATOM OF ANY OF THE USUAL BASES MAY BE SUBSTITUTED AN ATOM OF SODA FOR INSTANCE AS IN OUR SUBPHOS PHATE OF WHICH THE SYMBOL IS N A3 P AN ATOM OF OXIDE OF SILVER AS IN THE YELLOW SUBPHOSPHATE OF SILVER AND SO IN THE OTHER SUBPHOSPHATES WE HAVE HERE A CLUE ALSO TO THE DISPOSITION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID TO FORM SUCH SUB SESQUISALTS FOR THE COMMON PHOSPHATE OF SODA WHICH WE USE AS A PRECIPITANT 2 L 2 250MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES EXCHANGES ITS BASIC WATER FOR A FIXED BASE HENCE ALTHOUGH A PHOSPHATE OF NEUTRAL COMPOSITION SUCH AS THE COMMON PHOSPHATE OF SODA CANNOT BE MADE ANHYDROUS WITHOUT BECOMING PYROPHOSPHATE THE SUBPHOSPHATES HAVING AN EXCESS OF FIXED BASE MAY BE ANHYDROUS AS WAS OBSERVED BY STROMEYER AND INDEED THEY ARE NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO PYROSALTS THE PYROPHOSPHORIC ACID OF CLARK WHICH EXISTS IN THE PYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA APPEARS TO UNITE WITH ONLY TWO ATOMS OF BASE PHOSPHORIC ACID PRODUCED IN WHITE FLAKES ON BURNING PHOSPHORUS IN AIR OR OXYGEN GAS OR THE ACID HEATED TO REDNESS BY ITSELF CONSTITUTES WE SHALL AFTER WARDS FIND A THIRD MODIFICATION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID THIS THIRD VARIETY IS CHA RACTERIZED BY ALONE COAGULATING ALBUMEN BY PRODUCING PRECIPITATES EVEN WHEN FREE IN MURIATE OF BARYTES LIME C MUCH TIME AND ATTENTION WERE DEVOTED TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE WATER OF COMBINATION OF THE FOREGOING SUBSALTS BOTH SALTS WHEN DRIED BY HEAT ACT UPON GLASS WITH AS MUCH VIOLENCE AS THE CAUSTIC ALKALIES ABSORB CARBONIC ACID WITH AVIDITY AND RETAIN A SMALL BUT NOTABLE QUANTITY OF WATER UNDER THE MOST INTENSE HEAT THE PROBLEM IS THEREFORE ENVIRONED BY DIFFICULTIES 1 EXCELLENT HARD CRYSTALS OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA LOST NOTHING WHEN REDUCED TO POWDER AND EXPOSED TO A DRY ATMOSPHERE DRIED MOST CAUTIOUSLY IN A PLA TINUM FLASK ON A SANDBATH WATER IN EXP 1 4242 GRS

ALONE FOR AN ADOPTER BEING APPLIED TO THE FLASK AND MADE TIGHT BY LUTING THE SALT WAS IN EACH CASE SUBSEQUENTLY HEATED FOR A FEW MINUTES TO FULL REDNESS WITHOUT ANY FURTHER LOSS OF WEIGHT NO SENSIBLE ABSORPTION OF CARBONIC ACID OCCURRED WHEN THE EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED IN THIS MANNER THE SALT WAS NOT FUSED INDEED IT IS NOT FUSED BY A STRONG WHITE HEAT BUT THE CALCINED SALT STILL CONTAINS WATER AS MAY BE SHOWN BY FUSING IT WITH ANY BODY CAPABLE OF COMBINING WITH THE EXCESS OF ALKALI A QUANTITY OF BICHRO 2 56AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID MATE OF POTASH IN A GLASS TUBE MAY EASILY BE KEPT IN A STATE OF FUSION BY THE FLAME OF A LAMP ON THROWING THE CALCINED SUBARSENIATE INTO THAT FUSED AND ANHYDROUS SALT A NOTABLE QUANTITY OF WATER WAS GIVEN OFF WHICH CONDENSED IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TUBE EXP 1 ABOUT 50 GRAINS OF THE FUSED BICHROMATE OF POTASH AS IT FALLS TO PIECES IN THE PROGRESS OF COOLING BUT STILL WARM WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE PLA TINUM FLASK CONTAINING 131 GRAINS OF CALCINED SALT OF EXPERIMENT 2ND ABOVE AND THE WHOLE MAINTAINED IN A STATE OF FUSION FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME AT A LOW RED HEAT BY MEANS OF A SPIRITLAMP THE SALT LOST 016 GRAIN ADDITIONAL AND NO GREEN OXIDE OF CHROMIUM WAS FORMED THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF 062 PER CENT ON THE CRYSTALLIZED SALT AND MAKES THE ENTIRE WATER AMOUNT TO 50131 PER CENT EXP 2 2557 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SUBARSENIATE WERE INTRODUCED WITH A LITTLE WATER INTO A CRUCIBLE CONTAINING ALREADY 20 GRAINS OF PURE ANHYDROUS ARSENIC ACID CALCINED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE BY A SPIRITLAMP HEAT WHICH DOES NOT DECOM POSE IT THE WHOLE WAS CAUTIOUSLY DRIED AND FINALLY FUSED BY A RED HEAT THE LOSS AMOUNTED TO 128 GRAINS OR 5006 PER CENT EXP 3 TO 2511 GRAINS OF BINARSENIATE OF SODA PREVIOUSLY FUSED IN A CRUCIBLE 45 5 GRAINS OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA WERE ADDED WITH WATER SUFFICIENT TO DISSOLVE THE WHOLE CAUTIOUSLY EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS IN A CRUCIBLE PARTIALLY COVERED BY A WATCHGLASS AS USUAL AND FINALLY HEATED TO REDNESS THE SUBARSENIATE LOST 2288 GRAINS OR 5029 PER CENT THIS LAST IS CERTAINLY THE PREFERABLE MODE OF DETERMINING THE PROBLEM THE MEAN OF THE THREE EXPERIMENTS DETAILED GIVES THE ENTIRE WATER IN THE SUBARSENIATE OF SODA 5022 PER CENT WHILE THE PROPORTION EXPELLED BY HEAT ALONE AMOUNTS TO 4975 PER CENT HENCE THE QUANTITY RETAINED AMOUNTS TO 047 PER CENT WHEN THE CALCINED SALT RETAINING THIS SMALL QUANTITY OF WATER IS REDUCED TO AN IMPALPABLE POWDER AND HEATED AFRESH ON THE SANDBATH THE WHOLE WATER IS EXPELLED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A MERE TRACE ALTHOUGH SMALL THE QUANTITY OF WATER RETAINED IN THE CALCINED SALT COULD NOT BE PASSED OVER WITHOUT INVESTIGATION AS IT MAY AFFORD INDICATION OF SOME INTERNAL CHANGE WHICH THE SUBARSENIATE UNDERGOES CALCINED IN THE OPEN FIRE THIS SALT ABSORBS CARBONIC ACID GAS AND AFTERWARDS EFFERVESCES BRISKLY WITH AN 2578MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES ACID THE SALT BECOMES AT THE SAME TIME ANHYDROUS THIS MAY ARISE FROM THE HYDRATE OF SODA BECOMING CARBONATE OF SODA A PORTION OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA DRIED BY THE SPIRITLAMP WAS REDUCED TO POWDER AND CALCINED ANEW WITH A MASS OF CARBONATE OF AMMONIA IN THE SAME CRUCIBLE SO THAT THE MAXIMUM ABSORPTION OF CARBONIC ACID AS IT WAS IMA GINED MIGHT TAKE PLACE THE SALT WAS KEPT UNCOVERED FOR SOME TIME AT A LOW RED HEAT AFTER ALL THE VOLATILE CARBONATE HAD ESCAPED IT WAS FOUND THAT THE QUANTITY OF CARBONIC ACID ABSORBED MIGHT BE DETERMINED MOST EXACTLY BY DISENGAGING THE GAS OVER MERCURY BY MEANS OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF MURIATIC ACID SLIGHTLY DILUTED ELEVEN GRAINS OF CALCINED SALT AFFORDED 049 CUBIC INCH OF CARBONIC ACID GAS AT 600 OF WHICH THE WEIGHT IS 023 GRAIN AND WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO 056 GRAIN OF CARBONATE OF SODA HENCE BY CALCULATION 100 PARTS OF THE CALCINED SALT CONTAIN 2 1 CARBONIC ACID OR 51 CARBONATE OF SODA 21 CARBONIC ACID ARE EQUIVALENT TO 0 9 WATER BUT 50 CALCINED SALT IT WAS PREVIOUSLY SHOWN RETAIN 047 WATER AND THEREFORE 100 CALCINED SALT RETAIN 094 IT WOULD THUS APPEAR THAT THE CARBONIC ACID IS JUST IN QUANTITY SUFFICIENT TO OCCUPY THE PLACE OF THE WATER THE CARBONIC ACID IS NOT EXPELLED BY AN INTENSE WHITE HEAT THE SUPPOSITION IS QUITE INADMISSIBLE THAT OUR SALT CONTAINS THE NOTABLE QUANTITY OF SODA WHICH BECOMES CARBONATE AS A CASUAL IMPURITY AND NOT ESSENTIAL TO ITS COMPOSITION FOR THE SALT EMPLOYED IN ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS WAS IN LARGE CLEAR AND PERFECT CRYSTALS SUCH A SUPPOSITION IS ALSO OPPOSED BY THE ANALYTIC DETERMINATION OF THE SODA THE QUANTITY OF WATER IN THE SALT NAMELY 5022 PER CENT IS NOT EASILY RE CONCILED WITH OUR BEST DATA FOR ATOMIC WEIGHTS ADOPTING THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ARSENIC ACID GIVEN BY BERZELIUS WHICH I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF VERIFYING A SALT OF 24 ATOMIC PROPORTIONS OF WATER CORRESPOND WITH 5082 PER CENT 23    5029 23   4975 OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULT AGREES CLOSELY WITH THE MIDDLE NUMBER AND IS PERHAPS  WE ARE OBLIGED TO ADOPT THE DOUBLE ATOM OF ARSENIC ACID HERE AS  14401 AND CONSIDER THESE SUBSALTS AS CONSISTING OF ONE PROPORTION OF ARSENIC ACID CONTAINING FIVE PROPORTIONS OXYGEN AND THREE PROPORTIONS OF BASE CONTAINING THREE OF OXYGEN 258AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID COMPATIBLE WITH EITHER 23 OR 24 ATOMS OF WATER CHEMISTS WILL PROBABLY AGREE WITH ME THAT THE LAST SUPPOSITION IS THE MOST LIKELY IF SO IT IS CURIOUS THAT THE SUBARSENIATE DIFFERS ONLY FROM THE NEUTRAL ARSENIATE BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF AN ATOM OF SODA FOR AN ATOM OF WATER FOR THE LAST SALT CONTAINS 25 ATOMS OF WATER IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE ANALYTIC DETERMINATION OF THE ACID IN THE ARSE NIATES AND PHOSPHATES IS ATTENDED WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY CHIEFLY FROM UNSTEADINESS IN THE PROPORTIONS OF THE PRECIPITATES 41L87 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SUBARSENIATE OF SODA PRECIPITATED BY AN EXCESS OF PURE ACETATE OF LEAD GAVE A NEUTRAL MOTHERLIQUOR AND A QUANTITY OF SUBAR SENIATE OF LEAD WHICH SUCCESSFULLY WASHED BY DECANTATION WITHOUT THE USE OF A FILTER AND HEATED TO REDNESS WEIGHED 46A41 GRAINS 3517 GRAINS OF THIS SUBARSE NIATE OF LEAD FRESHLY CALCINED WERE DISSOLVED ENTIRELY IN WATER ACIDULATED WITH NITRIC ACID AND PRECIPITATED BY SULPHATE OF SODA GAVE 3586 GRAINS OF SULPHATE OF LEAD WHICH CONTAIN 2638 OXIDE OF LEAD IN SUCH CALCULATIONS THE ATOMIC NUMBERS OF BERZELIUS ARE ADOPTED IN THIS PAPER HIENCE THE PORTION OF SUBARSE NIATE OF LEAD ANALYSED CONTAINS 879 ARSENIC ACID AND THE WHOLE 46A41 GRAINS SUBARSENIATE OF LEAD CONTAIN 11 62 ARSENIC ACID WHICH IS THEREFORE THE QUANTITY OF ARSENIC ACID IN THE PORTION OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA SUBMITTED TO ANALYSIS HENCE CRYSTALLIZED SUBARSENIATE OF SODA CONTAINS 2776 PER CENT ARSENIC ACID THE SODA OF THE SALT WAS DETERMINED IN THE USUAL WAY THE ARSENIC ACID BEING PRECIPITATED BY ACETATE OF LEAD AND RECEIVED ON A FILTER THE EXCESS OF LEAD WAS REMOVED BY CARBONATE OF AMMONIA ADDED TO THE HOT LIQUOR THE SOLUTION OF ACETATE OF SODA RESULTING WAS THEN FILTERED CONCENTRATED AND TRANS FERRED INTO A PLATINUM CRUCIBLE IN WHICH IT WAS EVAPORATED ON THE SANDBATH TO DRYNESS WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION PARTIALLY COVERED BY A WATCHGLASS AND EVENTUALLY DECOMPOSED BY A FULL RED HEAT GRADUALLY APPLIED TO THE CRUCIBLE STILL COVERED BY THE WATCHGLASS AS FROM THE EFFERVESENCE DURING THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE ACETATES SMALL PARTICLES ARE THROWN UP WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THE SOLUTION OF CARBONATE WAS THEN FILTERECL EVAPO RATED TO DRYNESS IN A CRUCIBLE AND RAISED TO A STRONG RED HEAT THE FOLLOWING RESULTS WERE OBTAINED AFTER A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN ACQUIRED EXP 1 3998 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SUBARSENIATE OF SODA YIELDED 15I61 CAR BONATE OF SODA EQUIVALENT TO 914 SODA OR THE SALT CONTAINS 22 87 PER CENT 259MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES SODA NOW 2287 SODA CONTAIN 585 OXYGEN AND 5022 WATER CONTAIN 4574 OXYGEN OR THE OXYGEN IN THE WATER IS 7819 TIMES THAT IN THE BASE BUT AS THERE ARE THREE ATOMS OF OXYGEN IN THE BASE THERE ARE 7819 X 3 OR 23457 ATOMIC PROPORTIONS OF OXYGEN IN THE WATER EXP 2 403 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SUBARSENIATE OF SODA YIELDED 1573 CARBO NATE OF SODA EQUIVALENT TO 921 SODA OR THE SALT CONTAINS 2285 PER CENT SODA EXP 3 2162 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SALT GAVE 841 CARBONATE OF SODA EQUI VALENT TO 493 SODA OR 100 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SALT CONTAIN 228 SODA THESE EXPERIMENTS AGREE VERY CLOSELY AMONG THEMSELVES BUT I AM DOUBTFUL WHETHER THIS METHOD GIVES THE ALKALI WITH PERFECT PRECISION IN THE CASE OF THE ARSENIATES BUT SOMEWHAT IN EXCESS THE GENERAL RESULT OF THE ANALYSES MAY BE STATED AS FOLLOWS SUBARSENIATE OF SODA EXPERIMENT THEORY OF 23 ATOMS WATER ARSENIC ACID   2776    2769 SODA  2285    2255 WATER    5022   4975 10083 100 2 THE CRYSTALS OF SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA SUBMITTED TO ANALYSIS WERE SMALLER THAN THE CRYSTALS OF SUBARSENIATE BUT WELL FORMED AND REMARKABLY PURE CON TAINING NOT A TRACE OF SULPHURIC MURIATIC OR CARBONIC ACID EXP 1 A QUANTITY OF THE SALT HAD BEEN REDUCED TO POWDER AND EXPOSED TO A DRY ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH IT LOST A LITTLE WEIGHT OF THE SALT SO DRIED 2912 GRAINS LOST BY RED HEAT IN A PLATINUM RETORT AS DESCRIBED IN THE CASE OF THE SUBARSENIATE 1607 GRAINS WHICH IS 5519 PER CENT WATER EXP 2 2183 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SALT HEATED IN THE PLATINUM RETORT ON THE SANDBATH LOST 1205 GRAINS OR 552 PER CENT BEING HEATED THEREAFTER TO REDNESS BY THE LAMP THE LOSS APPEARED TO BE ONLY 1201 GRAINS BUT THE CAL CINED SALT HAD ACQUIRED A LITTLE CARBONIC ACID NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRECAUTIONS AND NOW EFFERVESCED WITH ACIDS THESE TWO EXPERIMENTS GIVE THEREFORE THE SAME RESULT THE SALT STILL RETAINED A LITTLE WATER ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AS THE SUBAR SENIATE IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WHEN THE CALCINED SUBPHOSPHATE WAS 260AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID REDUCED TO AN IMPALPABLE POWDER AND HEATED ANEW THE GREATER PORTION OF THE WATER WHICH HAD BEEN RETAINED WAS READILY EXPELLED EXP 3 FUSED WITH RECENTLY IGNITED PROTOXIDE OF LEAD 1936 GRAINS OF CRY STALLIZED SALT LOST 1084 GRAINS OR 5599 PER CENT WHICH IS THE ENTIRE WATER IN THE SALT EXP 4 TO 17 GRAINS OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA RECENTLY FUSED IN A CRUCIBLE 3554 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA WERE ADDED WITH A QUANTITY OF WATER IN WHICH THE SALTS WERE DISSOLVED TOGETHER BY DIGESTION EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS AND CALCINED BY A RED HEAT WITHOUT FUSING THE SALTS SUSTAINED A LOSS OF 1992 GRAINS HENCE 100 CRYSTALLIZED SALT HAVE ABANDONED 5605 WATER CALCINED WITH ACCESS OF CARBONIC ACID THE SUBPHOSPHATE LIKE THE SUBARSE NIATE ABSORBS THAT GAS BECOMING AT THE SAME TIME ANHYDROUS BUT REDIS SOLVED IN WATER AND EVAPORATED IT AFFORDS CRYSTALS OF THE ORIGINAL FORM AND COMPOSITION WHICH RETAIN A TRACE OF CARBONIC ACID A QUANTITY OF THE SUBPHOSPHATE IGNITED IN AN OPEN CRUCIBLE WAS FOUND TO CONSIST OF SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA  100 CARBONIC ACID    23 ANOTHER PORTION CALCINED WITH A MASS OF DRY CARBONATE OF AMMONIA IN THE SAME CRUCIBLE CONSISTED OF SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA  100 CARBONIC ACID    225 A QUANTITY OF SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA DISSOLVED IN A SOLUTION OF CARBONATE OF AMMONIA WAS THEREBY PURPOSELY CONTAMINATED BY A LARGE QUANTITY OF CAR BONIC ACID AND CALCINED THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION WITH ALTERNATE PULVERIZATION IT FINALLY CONSISTED OF SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA  100 CARBONIC ACID     17 OR OF SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA   100 CARBONATE OF SODA   43 IT SEEMED TO FOLLOW FROM THE LAST EXPERIMENT THAT BY PULVERIZING THE SALT MDCCCXXXIII 2 M 261MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES AND RECALCINING IT THE QUANTITY OF CARBONIC ACID MAY BE DIMINISHED AS IN THE CASE OF WATER IN THE HYDRATE OF THE SAME SALT THE CALCINED SALT DID NOT FUSE AT A STRONG WHITE HEAT BUT ACQUIRED A BEAU TIFUL BLUE TINT WHERE IN CONTACT WITH PLATINUM BY THE MEAN OF TWO EXPERIMENTS DETAILED ABOVE 100 CRYSTALLIZED SUBPHOS PHATE OF SODA CONTAIN 5603 WATER TWENTYTHREE ATOMS WOULD BE 5561 PER CENT ONLY AND TWENTYFOUR ATOMS WATER WOULD BE 5666 PER CENT THE SODA OF THE SUBPHOSPHATE WAS DETERMINED DIRECTLY IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE SODA OF THE SUBARSENIATE EXP 1 4123 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SALT GAVE 1727 CARBONATE OF SODA EQUI VALENT TO 1012 SODA HENCE 100 OF CRYSTALLIZED SALT CONTAIN 2454 SODA EXP 2 40 GRAINS OF THE CRYSTALLIZED SALT GAVE 1697 CARBONATE OF SODA EQUIVALENT TO 703 SODA OR 2487 PER CENT SODA IT WAS ALSO ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE THE PHOSPHORIC ACID DIRECTLY BY PRECI PITATING WITH NITRATE OF SILVER WHICH LEAVES A MOTHERLIQUOR EITHER EXACTLY NEU TRAL OR FEEBLY ALKALINE THE RESULT WAS 186 PER CENT PHOSPHORIC ACID WHICH CERTAINLY APPROACHES THE TRUTH BUT THE SUBPHOSPHATE OF SILVER WAS DISCOVERED TO CARRY DOWN WITH IT A PORTION OF NITRATE OF SILVER WHICH COMES AWAY GRA DUALLY BUT WHICH NO CONTINUANCE OF WASHING IS SUFFICIENT ENTIRELY TO REMOVE THE SUBARSENIATE OF SILVER HAS THE SAME PROPERTY THUS TO PRECIPITATE 275 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA 381 GRAINS OF FUSED NITRATE OF SILVER WERE FOUND NECESSARY WHICH IS MORE THAN ONE GRAIN ABOVE THE THEO RETICAL QUANTITY 25 GRAINS OF CRYSTALLIZED SUBARSENIATE OF SODA REQUIRED 3108 GRAINS OF NITRATE OF SILVER FOR COMPLETE PRECIPITATION WHICH IS AN EQUALLY EXCESSIVE PROPORTION OF THE PRECIPITANT FROM THESE PRECIPITATES FUMES OF NITROUS ACID WERE EVOLVED ON THE APPLICATION OF HEAT WHEN NITRATE OF AM MONIA EXACTLY NEUTRAL WAS FIRST MIXED WITH THE SOLUTION OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA A LESS QUANTITY OF NITRATE OF SILVER SUFFICED 3005 GRAINS OF NITRATE OF SIL VER LEFT STILL AN EXCESS OF ARSENIC ACID WHEN ADDED TO 25 GRAINS OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA BUT ON INTRODUCING 006 GRAIN OF NITRATE OF SILVER ADDITIONAL THE LIQUID CONTAINED AN EXCESS OF SILVER BUT THE NITRATE OF AMMONIA RETAINS IN SOLUTION A TRACE OF SUBARSENIATE OF SILVER IT IS CURIOUS THAT THE PURE SUBARSENIATE OF SIL VER PRECIPITATED IN THE WAY LAST MENTIONED WITHDRAWS NOTHING FROM A SOLU  ASSUMING THE DOUBLE ATOM OF PHOSPHORIQ ACID P  8923 262AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACIDS TION OF NITRATE OF SILVER THIS SHOWS THAT THE SUBARSENIATE OF SILVER CARRIES DOWN THE SOLUBLE NITRATE ONLY AT THE MOMENT OF PRECIPITATION AND BY THE AGENCY OF SOME CHEMICAL AFFINITY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ATTRACTION OF ANIMAL CHAR COAL FOR MANY BODIES IN SOLUTION THE ADDITION OF A LITTLE ACETIC ACID TO A SOLUTION OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA OCCA SIONED A NOTABLE DEFICIENCY IN THE AMOUNT OF THE PRECIPITATE BY NITRATE OF SILVER IT MAY BE SAFELY CONCLUDED FROM THE QUANTITY OF SODA WHICH IT CONTAINS THAT THE SALT UNDER EXAMINATION IS A SUBSESQUIPHOSPHATE THE CRYSTALS CONSIST OF SUBSESQUIPHOSPHATE OF SODA  4397 WATER    5603 100 2 SUBPHOSPHATES AND SUBARSENIATE OF POTASH THE CORRESPONDING SALTS OF POTASH WERE FORMED BUT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN OBTAINING THEM IN A STATE OF PURITY WHEN CAUSTIC POTASH IS ADDED IN EXCESS TO PHOSPHORIC ACID THE SOLUTION BE COMES MUDDY ALTHOUGH DILUTE AND A PRECIPITATE PARTLY FLAKY AND PARTLY IN A GRITTY POWDER SHOWS ITSELF THIS PRECIPITATE IN BOTH CONDITIONS IS A DIPHOS PHATE OF POTASH ACCORDING TO DR THOMSON WHO EXAMINED IT  WHEN ARSENIC ACID WAS TREATED IN THE SAME WAY WITH EXCESS OF CAUSTIC POTASH NO INSOLUBLE SALT FELL BUT ON CONCENTRATING THE SOLUTION IT CRYSTALLIZED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN THE FORM OF MINUTE NEEDLES THESE CRYSTALS I COULD NOT FIEE FROM CARBONATE AND EITHER OF THEMSELVES OR RATHER FROM THE PRESENCE OF FREE POTASH THEY WERE DELI QUESCENT IN THE EXTREME THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CONSTITUTE A SUBSALT CORRESPONDING WITH THE SUBSALT OF SODA A CRYSTALLIZED SUBPHOSPHATE OF POTASH HOWEVER MAY BE FORMED BY FUSING TOGETHER PHOSPHORIC ACID AND AN EXCESS OF CARBONATE OF POTASH BICARBONATE WAS EMPLOYED A STRONG SOLUTION CRYSTALLIZES IN SMALL NEEDLES LIKE THE PRE CEDING SUBSALTS THESE CRYSTALS WERE EXCEEDINGLY SOLUBLE AND RETAINED A LITTLE CARBONATE OF POTASH BUT WERE NOT AT ALL DELIQUESCENT THEY PRECIPITATED THE YELLOW SUBPHOSPHATE FROM NITRATE OF SILVER IN EXCESS AND LEFT A NEUTRAL OR SLIGHTLY ALKALINE MOTHERLIQUOR  INORGANIC CHEMISTRY VOL II 2M2 263MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES THE SOLUBLE SUBARSENIATE AND SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA PRESENT A FAVOURABLE OP PORTUNITY OF FORMING THE CORRESPONDING INSOLUBLE EARTHY AND METALLIC SUBSALTS SALTS OF THIS FORMULA IT IS WELL KNOWN GENERALLY PRESENT THEMSELVES EVEN WHEN THE ALKALINE SALTS OF ARSENIC AND PHOSPHORIC ACID WHICH ARE NEUTRAL IN COM POSITION ARE EMPLOYED AS PRECIPITANTS BUT THE CONSEQUENT AND UNAVOIDABLE ACIDITY OF THE MOTHERLIQUOR IS APT TO PREVENT COMPLETE PRECIPITATION THE PHOS PHATES WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS BEING SOLUBLE IN AN EXCESS OF ACID 3 SUBARSENIATE AND SUBPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES TO A SOLUTION OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA CHLORIDE OF BARIUM WAS GRADUALLY ADDED TILL IN SLIGHT EXCESS THE PRECIPITATE FIRST APPEARED GELATINOUS CONSISTING OF LITTLE PELLUCID MASSES BUT ON THE APPLICATION OF HEAT TO THE LIQUOR THE PRECI PITATE IMMEDIATELY BECAME SMALLFLAKY AND HEAVY AND SUBSIDED THE MOTHER LIQUOR PROVED STRONGLY ALKALINE AND THE PRECIPITATE IT WAS FOUND HAD TAKEN DOWN WITH IT A QUANTITY OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA OF WHICH PROTRACTED WASHING DID NOT ENTIRELY DIVEST IT BERZELIUS HAS REMARKED THAT BARYTES IS MOST DIS POSED TO COMBINE WITH PHOSPHORIC ACID IN THE PROPORTION OF A NEUTRAL SALT WHICH IS TRUE ALSO OF ARSENIC ACID AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE ABOVE DERANGEMENT OF PRECIPITATION A LITTLE OF THE NEUTRAL SALT BEING PROBABLY FORMED THE PROCESS WAS REVERSED AND INTO A LARGE QUANTITY OF NEUTRAL SOLUTION OF CHLORIDE OF BARIUM A SOLUTION OF 50 GRAINS OF SUBARSENIATE OF SODA WAS GRADUALLY POURED WITH STIRRING A PULVERULENT HEAVY PRECIPITATE FELL EASILY THE FILTERED MO THERLIQUOR DID NOT FULLY RESTORE THE BLUE COLOUR OF REDDENED LITMUS PAPER IN SOME HOURS BUT ACTED AT ONCE AS AN ALKALI ON CUDBEAR PAPER ALTHOUGH IN A FEEBLE MANNER THE PRECIPITATE HOWEVER WAS EASILY WASHED WHILE STILL WET ON THE FILTER IT HAD ACQUIRED A SENSIBLE TRACE OF CARBONIC ACID AND WHEN HEATED IT DISPLAYED LIKE THE CORRESPONDING ALKALINE SALTS CONSIDERABLE AVIDITY FOR CAR BONIC ACID 2233 GRAINS OF THIS SALT HEATED TO REDNESS

SUBARSENIATE AND SUBPHOSPHATE OF LIME THE SUBARSENIATE OF LIME FORMED BY POURING CHLORIDE OF CALCIUM INTO SUB ARSENIATE OF SODA IS A BULKY GELATINOUS BODY AND CONTINUES SO ALTHOUGH HEATED IT CARRIES

HYDRO GEN BUT THE QUANTITY OF LEAD WHICH THEY CONTAINED WAS TOO SMALL TO BE APPRE CIATED THIS ANALYSIS AFFORDS A STRIKING CONFIRMATION OF THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF ARSENIC ACID DEDUCED BY BERZELIUS FROM HIS ANALYSIS OF ARSENIOUS ACID BY SUL PHUR I PLACE TOGETHER THE RESULTS OF MY ANALYSIS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE SAME SALT CALCULATED BY THAT ACCOMPLISHED ANALYST FROM HIS OWN DATA ANALYSIS THEORY OF BERZELIUS ARSENIC ACID   2567 2561 OXIDE OF LEAD  7433    7439 IN ANOTHER ANALYSIS THE QUANTITY OF LEAD WHICH ESCAPED PRECIPITATION BY THE SULPHATE OF SODA WAS EVEN MORE NOTABLE FROM THE PRESENCE OF TOO MUCH NITRIC ACID THE RESULT WAS 74 18 PER CENT OXIDE OF LEAD THIS SALT I BELIEVE TO BE MOST SUITABLE OF ALL THE ARSENIATES FOR DETERMINING DIRECTLY THE COMBINING PRO PORTION OF ARSENIC ACID II OF THE NEUTRAL PHOSPHATES AND PYROPHOSPHATES IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE PHOSPHATE OF SODA IS A HIGHLY ALKALINE SALT ALTHOUGH GENERALLY VIEWED AS NEUTRAL IN COMPOSITION MITSCHERLICH FOUND THAT A SOLU TION OF THIS SALT REQUIRED THE ADDITION OF HALF AS MUCH ACID AS IT ALREADY POS SESSES TO DEPRIVE IT OF AN ALKALINE REACTION THIS RESULT I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF CONFIRMING IN A GENERAL WAY ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT ASCERTAIN THE EXACT POINT OF SATURATION FROM THE TESTPAPER PROVING DOUBTFUL IN ITS INDICATIONS FOR A CON SIDERABLE DISTANCE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SUPPOSED POINT OF NEUTRALITY ALTHOUGH MR CLARKS EXPERIMENTS AFFORD STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE PHOS PIHATE OF SODA OF THE USUAL FORM CONTAINS TWENTYFIVE ATOMS WATER YET IT WAS THOUGHT PROPER TO SETTLE THE POINT BY A CAREFUL EXPERIMENT PURE CRYSTALS WERE EMPLOYED WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE AND WERE DRY BUT 267MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES POSSESSED BRIGHT SURFACES A PORTION FOR ANALYSIS WAS REDUCED TO POWDER IN A DAMP

3544 GRAINS OF THE SALT LOST 2229 GRAINS OF WATER HENCE THE CRYSTALLIZED SALT CONSISTS OF PHOSPHATE OF SODA   371 WATER   629 100 OUR RESULT GIVES 2522 ATOMS WATER AND THEREFORE CONFIRMS THE PREVIOUS DETER MINATION MR CLARK HAS THE ENTIRE MERIT OF DISCOVERING THE CHANGE WHICH TAKES PLACE UPON PHOSPHATE OF SODA BY THE ACTION OF HEAT AND HIS ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA IS VERY COMPLETE HE LIKEWISE REMARKED THE CON NEXION BETWEEN THE TRANSITION INTO PYROPHOSPHATE AND THE LOSS OF THE LAST ATOM OF WATER OF THE PHOSPHATE OF SODA WHICH ATOM REQUIRES A MUCH HIGHER TEMPE RATURE TO EXPEL IT THAN THE OTHER TWENTYFOUR BUT HE DID NOT ENTERTAIN THE IDEA BROACHED IN THIS PAPER OF THE BASIC FUNCTION OF THAT ATOM OF WATER IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SALT THE PHOSPHATE OF SODA CONTAINS THREE ATOMS BASE NAMELY TWO ATOMS SODA AND ONE ATOM WATER AND WHEN ADDED TO THE EARTHY OR METALLIC SALTS GIVES PRECIPITATES WHICH UNIFORMLY CONTAIN THREE ATOMS BASE NAMELY THREE ATOMS OF THE FOREIGN OXIDE AS IN THE CASE OF THE SUBPHOSPHATE OF SILVER OR ONE ATOUL WATER AND TWO ATOMS OF THE OTHER OXIDE AS IN THE PHOSPHATE OF BARYTES THESE PRECI PITATIONS AFFORD THE STRONGEST PROOF OF THE BASIC FUNCTION OF THAT ATOM OF WATER WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO THE PHOSPHATE OF SODA AS THEY CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE USUAL LAWS OF DOUBLE DECOMPOSITION ON NO OTHER SUPPOSITION THE PYRO PHOSPHATE OF SODA ON THE OTHER HAND CONTAINS ONLY TWO ATOMS SODA AS BASE AND GIVES ACCORDINGLY BIBASIC PRECIPITATES IN HIS TRAIT6 DE CHIMIE DUMAS SPEAKS IN AN INCIDENTAL MANNER OF A THIRD PHOSPHATE OF SODA DIFFERING FROM THE TWO PRECEDING OBTAINED BY KEEPING FOR A LONG TIME A SOLUTION OF THE COMMON PHOSPHATE AT THE BOILING TEMPERATURE BUT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER NO DESCRIPTION NOR ANY OTHER NOTICE OF THIS NEW  EDINBURGH JOURNAL OF SCIENCE VOL VII P 298 268AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID SALT TO INVESTIGATE THE POINT I BOILED FOR SEVERAL HOURS EACH DAY DURING THREE WEEKS AN OUNCE OF PHOSPHATE AND THE SAME QUANTITY OF PYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA IN SEPARATE FLASKS WITH SEVERAL OUNCES OF WATER A CONSIDERABLE HEAVY FLAKY PRECIPITATE SOON APPEARED IN BOTH BUT WAS MOST ABUNDANT IN THE PYROPHOS PHATE THE FLASKS ON REMOVING THE LIQUORS FROM THEM WERE FOUND STRONGLY CORRODED THE SOLUTION OF PYROPHOSPHATE ON BEING FILTERED AND CONCENTRATED YIELDED CRYSTALS OF OUR SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA TO THE LAST DROP IT HAD EVIDENTLY DERIVED ALKALI FROM THE GLASS WHILE A PORTION OF ITS ACID HAD ALSO UNITED WITH THE OXIDE OF LEAD OF THE GLASS AND FORMED A PRECIPITATE INSOLUBLE BOTH IN WATER AND IN ACIDS BUT THE SOLUTION OF THE BOILED PHOSPHATE OF SODA FILTERED CONCEN TRATED AND SET ASIDE IN A COOL PLACE BECAME GRADUALLY FILLED WITH CRYSTALLINE PLATES WHICH WERE THE FINEST FILMS AND HAD A BEAUTIFUL SILKY LUSTRE THE MOTHER LIQUOR BEING POURED OFF YIELDED A SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH CROP OF CRYSTALS OF THE SAME SINGULAR APPEARANCE THE LAST DROPS OF THE LIQUOR WERE STILL ALKALINE BUT I THOUGHT NOT SO STRONGLY SO AS THE PHOSPHATE OF SODA THE CRYSTALLIZATION IN THESE CASES WAS GRADUAL AND NOT HURRIED AND CONFUSED TO LOOK AT THESE SILKY FILMS NOBODY WOULD HAVE GUESSED THEM TO BE PHOSPHATE OF SODA BUT ON EXAMINING THEM MINUTELY COMPLETE RHOMBOIDAL PLATES OF THE COMMON FORM OF PHOSPHATE OF SODA WERE DISTINGUISHED  AND THE WATER OF CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE SALT WAS FOUND TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THAT OF THE RHOMBOIDAL PHOSPHATE IN A DRY ATMOSPHERE TOO A PORTION OF THE SILKY PLATES AND AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF POUNDED CRYSTALS OF THE COMMON PHOSPHATE LOST THEIR WATER PARI PASSU IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT WE HAVE NEARLY OBTAINED THE PHOSPHATE OF SODA OF AN UNUSUAL APPEARANCE I SHALL HAVE OCCASION IN THE SEQUEL OF THE PAPER TO NOTICE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE PHOSPHATE PRESENTS ITSELF OF THIS APPEARANCE ON DISSOLVING AND RECRYSTALLIZING THE SILKY PLATES THE USUAL SOLID RHOMBOIDS PRE SENTED THEMSELVES IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED BY EXPERIMENT THAT NEITHER THE PHOSPHATE NOR PYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA IS ALTERED BY BEING BOILED FOR A WEEK IN WATER CONTAINED IN A SILVER CAPSULE IN WHICH NO DECOMPOSITION CAN TAKE PLACE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THEREFORE THAT THESE SALTS UNDERGO NO CHANGE AT THE BOILING TEMPERATURE UNLESS THEY REACT UPON THE MATERIAL OF THE CONTAINING VESSEL EVEN AT THE USUAL TEMPERATURE A SOLUTION OF THESE ALKALINE SALTS COR RODES A GLASS PHIAL AND BECOMES TURBID IN THE COURSE OF MONTHS MDCCCXXXIII 2 N 269MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES III OF THE SUPERPHOSPHATES 1 OF THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA THIS SALT ADMITS AS I SHALL IMMEDIATELY SHOW OF SO MANY CHANGES IN ITS CONSTITUTION AND PROPERTIES AS TO ENTITLE IT TO BE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES THE FACTS WHICH I HAVE TO COMMUNICATE ON THIS SUBJECT ARE CERTAINLY THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY OF THE PAPER AND WERE DE TERMINED WITH CARE AND CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF NOTICING THE DIMORPHISM OF THIS SALT AND CONFIRMED THE OBSERVATION OF MITSCHERLICH THAT BOTH FORMS OF CRYSTALS POSSESS THE SAME CHEMICAL PROPERTIES AND THE SAME PROPORTION OF WATER OF THE FOUR ATOMS OF WATER WHICH THE CRYSTALS CONTAIN THEY LOSE I FIND TWO ATOMS AT THE TEMPERA TURE OF 212 AND NOT A PARTICLE MORE TILL HEATED UP TO ABOUT 375 1ST THUS 496 GRAINS OF THE CRYSTALS REDUCED TO POWDER WHEN DRIED ON THE WATERBATH FOR SEVERAL DAYS RETAINED ONLY 076 WATER OR CONSISTED OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA   100 WATER   1809 11809 THIS IS AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE ONE HALF OF THE ENTIRE WATER IN THE CRYSTALS WHICH BY THE MEAN OF MITSCHERLICHS EXPERIMENTS CONSIST OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA   100 WATER   3557 13557 2ND 1001 GRAINS OF THE SALT DRIED ON THE WATERBATH RETAINED 153 WATER WHICH IS 1804 WATER TO 100 DRY SALT OR THE SAME RESULT AS IN 1 3RD 50 GRAINS OF THE CRYSTALS LOST 652 GRAINS ON THE WATERBATH THEIR ENTIRE WATER BEING BY THEORY 1277 THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE TWO ATOMS OF WATER RETAINED ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA AND THAT ITS COMPOSITION IS EXPRESSED BY THE FOLLOWING FORMULA NA H2P 270AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID IT CONTAINS THREE ATOMS BASE NAMELY ONE ATOM SODA AND TWO ATOMS WATER UNITED TO A DOUBLE ATOM OF PHOSPHORIC ACID THE SALT CANNOT SUSTAIN THE LOSS OF ANY PORTION OF THIS WATER WITHOUT ASSUMING A NEW TRAIN OF PROPERTIES THERE ARE ACCORDINGLY THREE ATOMS OXYGEN IN THE BASE TWO IN THE WATER AND ONE IN THE BASE AND FIVE IN THE ACID WHEN CRYSTALLIZED THE SALT CONTAINS BESIDES TWO ATOMS WATER OF CRYSTALLIZATION THE CRYSTALS OF BIPHOSPHATE OF POTASH CONTAIN ONLY THE TWO ESSENTIAL ATOMS OF WATER AND THE LUSTRE OF THEIR SURFACES IS NOT AFFECTED BY A WATERBATH HEAT NOR BY ANY DEGREE OF HEAT UNDER 400 FAHR A SOLUTION OF EITHER OF THESE ALKALINE BIPHOSPHATES WHEN ADDED TO NITRATE OF SILVER OCCASIONS A COPIOUS PRECIPITATION OF THE YELLOW SUBPHOSPHATE OF SILVER AND IF AMMONIA BE CAUTIOUSLY ADDED SO AS MERELY TO MAKE UP THE EXCESS OF NITRIC ACID DISENGAGED THE WHOLE PHOSPHORIC ACID FALLS IN THAT STATE IT IS TO BE HERE REMARKED THAT THE THREE ATOMS BASE OF THE ALKALINE BIPHOSPHATE ARE REPLACED IN THIS PRECIPITATION BY THREE ATOMS OF OXIDE OF SILVER 2 SECOND VARIETY OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA OR BIPYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA WHEN A QUANTITY OF THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA PREVIOUSLY DRIED ON THE WATER BATH IS AFTERWARDS GRADUALLY HEATED ON A SOLDERBATH IT BEGINS TO LOSE WATER AT ABOUT 3750 AND BEFORE IT IS RAISED TO 4000 IT HAS LOST EXACTLY HALF THE WATER WHICH IT POSSESSED OR ONE ATOM THE DRIED SALT MAY THEREAFTER BE HEATED UP TO 450 AND MAINTAINED FOR AN HOUR OR MORE AT THAT TEMPERATURE WITHOUT SUS TAINING ANY FURTHER LOSS WHEN RAPIDLY HEATED IN A GLASS TUBE THE SALT UNDER GOES SEMIFUSION AT SOME POINT NEAR 400 AND THE SAME QUANTITY OF WATER COMES OFF IN A STATE OF EBULLITION 1ST THUS 262 GRAINS OF THE SALT DRIED ON THE WATERBATH WHEN HEATED IN A THIN GLASS TUBE LOST AT ONCE 02 GRAIN WATER ON ATTAINING 400 WHICH IS ONE HALF OF THE WATER WHICH IT POSSESSED NAMELY 0396 GRAIN WHILE IT WAS EXPOSED AGAIN FOR FOUR HOURS TO A TEMPERATURE BETWEEN 450 AND 470 WITHOUT LOSING 001 GRAIN ADDITIONAL 2ND IN ONE EXPERIMENT 1845 GRAINS OF THE CRYSTALLIZED BIPHOSPHATE LOST 368 GRAINS BY 400 FAHR ON THE SOLDERBATH THIS IS 2704 OF THE 35 57 PARTS WATER WHICH ARE UNITED TO 100 DRY SALT IN THE CRYSTALS THE SALT HAS LOST 304 ATOMS OF WATER 2 N 2 271MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES 3RD A QUANTITY OF THE SALT PREVIOUSLY DEPRIVED OF ITS TWO ATOMS WATER OF CRYSTALLIZATION WAS KEPT FOR THREE HOURS AT A TEMPERATURE RANGING BETWEEN 400 AND 460 11 19 GRAINS OF THE SALT SO DRIED CONTAINED 09 WATER OR CONSISTED OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA 100 WATER   872 10872 THE WATER RETAINED AMOUNTS TO 0981 ATOM WHICH IS A CLOSE APPROXIMATION TO 1 ATOM 4TH A QUANTITY OF THE SALT WHICH HAD BEEN HEATED TO 4000 WAS DISSOLVED IN WATER EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS AND EXPOSED AGAIN FOR SOME DAYS ON A SOLDERBATH AT A TEMPERATURE NOT EXCEEDING 400 1394 GRAINS OF THE SALT SO DRIED STILL RETAINED 1 06 GRAIN WATER AS WAS FOUND BY FUSING THE SALT AT A RED HEAT OR IT CONSISTED OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA 100 WATER  823 10823 THIS IS LESS THAN ONE ATOMIC PROPORTION WHICH IS 889 PARTS BUT THE TEM PERATURE AT WHICH THE SALT LOSES ITS ENTIRE WATER IS ELEVATED NO GREAT NUMBER OF DEGREES ABOVE THAT IN WHICH IT LOSES THE ATOM UNDER CONSIDERATION AND A PRO TRACTED EXPOSURE TO THE AIR AT 400 OCCASIONS THE PARTIAL DISSIPATION OF THE LAST ATOMIC PROPORTION OF WATER AS IN THIS EXPERIMENT THE HEATED SALT WHICH RETAINS ONE ATOM WATER IS STILL VERY SOLUBLE AND POS SESSES AN ACID REACTION BUT IT IS ALTERED ESSENTIALLY IN PROPERTIES ADDED TO NITRATE OF SILVER IT PRODUCES A SPARING CHALKY WHITE PULVERULENT PRECIPITATE AND A VERY ACID LIQUOR BY THE CAUTIOUS ADDITION OF AMMONIA SO AS MERELY TO TAKE UP THE EXCESS OF NITRIC ACID THE ENTIRE PHOSPHORIC ACID IS PRECIPITATED IN THE SAME STATE THE PRECIPITATE PROVED ON ANALYSIS TO BE THE PYROPHOSPHATE OF SILVER CONTAINING TWO ATOMS OXIDE OF SILVER TO ONE DOUBLE ATOM PHOSPHORIC ACID OF THIS PRECIPITATE HEATED TO REDNESS BUT NOT FUSED 1875 GRAINS DISSOLVED IN NITRIC ACID AND PRECIPITATED BY MURIATIC ACID AFFORDED 1782 GRAINS CHLORIDE OF SILVER EQUIVALENT TO 1441 OXIDE OF SILVER THE COMPOSITION OF THIS PHOSPHATE 272AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID AND OF THE PYROPHOSPHATE OF SILVER WITH WHICH IT APPEARS TO CORRESPOND IS AS FOLLOWS EXPERIMENT THEORY OXIDE OF SILVER   7685    7649 PHOSPHORIC ACID   2315   2351 100 100 ADDED TO ACETATE OF LEAD THIS ALTERED BIPHOSPHATE LIKEWISE THREW DOWN THE PYROPHOSPHATE OF LEAD THE ACID OF THIS LAST SALT WAS SEPARATED BY SULPHU RETTED HYDROGEN AND WHEN AFTERWARDS NEUTRALIZED BY CARBONATE OF SODA IT AFFORDED CRYSTALS OF PYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA NOW THIS VARIETY OF THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA WHICH MAY BE CALLED THE BIPY ROPHOSPHATE CONTAINS ONE ATOM OF BASIC WATER AND ITS FORMULA IS NAHP OR IT CONTAINS TWO ATOMS BASE LIKE THE SALT OF SILVER WHICH IT PRECIPITATES THIS SALT WHEN TREATED WITH CAUSTIC SODA AFFORDS THE NEUTRAL PYROPHOSPHATE IT ALSO OCCASIONS A PRECIPITATE IN MURIATE OF BARYTES IN WHICH RESPECT IT DIFFERS FROM THE PROPER BIPHOSPHATE I FAILED IN ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN THE BIPYROPHOS PHATE OF SODA IN A CRYSTALLINE FORM IT UNIFORMLY DRIED UP INTO THE STATE OF A FRIABLE WHITE CRUST 3 THIRD VARIETY OF THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA WHEN THE SALT LAST DESCRIBED WAS EXPOSED ON THE SOLDERBATH FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT A TEMPERATURE BETWEEN 400 AND 470 IT LOST WEIGHT ONLY 348 PARTS OUT OF THE ENTIRE 3557 WATER WERE RETAINED IN ONE EXPERIMENT AND 281 PARTS WATER IN ANOTHER THE WHOLE WATER WAS EXPELLED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 038 TO 100 DRY SALT IN OTHER EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH THE SALT WAS HEATED ON THE SANDBATH PROBA BLY AT A TEMPERATURE NOT MUCH UNDER 600 THE SALT BECAME IN FACT VERY NEARLY ANHYDROUS NOW ON POURING WATER UPON THE SALT SO DRIED THE GREATER PART OF IT DISSOLVED AT ONCE BUT AN INCONSTANT QUANTITY REMAINED UNDISSOLVED VARYING FROM 657 TO 18 PARTS IN 100 SALT BUT INCREASING WITH THE INTENSITY OF THE HEAT TO WHICH THE SALT HAD BEEN EXPOSED THIS INSOLUBLE MATTER IS A FOURTH VARIETY OF THE BIPHOSPHATE WHICH SHALL IMMEDIATELY BE NOTICED AS THIS INSOLUBLE SALT MAY BE PROVED TO BE OF THE SAME COMPOSITION AS THE BIPHOSPHATE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SOLUBLE PORTION IS UNALTERED IN COMPOSITION 273MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES THE INSOLUBLE PORTION APPEARS A HEAVY DENSE POWDER YET AS A PART OF IT REMAINS IN SUSPENSION IN THE LIQUID FOR A LONG TIME IT IS NECESSARY TO FILTER TO OBTAIN THE SOLUBLE SALT IN A STATE OF PURITY THE PRECEDING TWO VARIETIES OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA HAVE A DISTINCT ACID REAC TION BUT THE SOLUTION OF THIS SALT IS EXACTLY NEUTRAL AS WAS DETERMINED BY VERY CAREFUL EXPERIMENTS THIS PROPERTY IS THE BEST DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER OF THIS VARIETY THAT I CAN MENTION WHEN A SOLUTION OF THE SALT IS CONCENTRATED IT DOES NOT DEPOSIT ANY OF THE INSOLUBLE VARIETY BUT ALLOWS RINGS OF DRY SALT TO FORM ROUND THE MARGIN OF THE FLUID WHICH ARE SOLUBLE I HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN CRYSTALLIZING IT IN THE VACUUM OF AN AIRPUMNP OR BY OTHER MEANS WHICH WERE EMPLOYED THE SALT ALWAYS DRIED UP INTO A FRIABLE WHITE CRUST WHICH ON ONE OCCASION WHEN DRIED AT 212 CONTAINED 11P56 PARTS WATER TO 100 ANHY DROUS SALT THIS SALT OCCASIONS A PRECIPITATE IN MURIATE OF BARYTES LIKE THE PRECEDING WITH NITRATE OF SILVER IT GIVES A CONSIDERABLE WHITE PULVERULENT PRECIPITATE AND THE LIQUID BECOMES STRONGLY ACID 838 GRAINS OF THIS PRECIPI TATE DRIED AND HEATED TO REDNESS WITHOUT FUSING WERE FOUND TO CONSIST OF 6O58 OXIDE OF SILVER AND 1 8 PHOSPHORIC ACID OR 7732 OXIDE OF SILVER AND 2268 PHOSPHORIC ACID  100 WHILE THE NEUTRAL PYROPHOSPHATE OF SILVER CONTAINING TWO ATOMS OXIDE OF SILVER CONSISTS OF 7649 OXIDE OF SILVER AND 2351 PHOSPHORIC ACID THE CORRESPONDENCE IS SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO PROVE THAT OUR SILVER PRECI PITATE IS THE SAME NEUTRAL PHOSPHATE WHICH PRESENTS ITSELF WHEN THE SECOND VARIETY OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA IS PRECIPITATED IN THE SAME MANNER LIKE THAT VARIETY ALSO THIS FORM OF THE BIPHOSPHATE AFFORDED CRYSTALS OF THE PYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA WHEN TREATED WITH CAUSTIC SODA IN REGARD TO THE EXACT CONSTITUTION OF THIS VARIETY I ENTERTAIN CONSIDERABLE DOUBT WE ARE WARRANTED TO PRESUME THAT THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA CAN EXIST IN AN ANHYDROUS CONDITION SOLUBLE IN WATER AND NEUTRAL IN ITS REACTION ON LIT MUS THE FORMULA OF THE SALT MAY BE NAP IT MUST HOWEVER BE ALLOWED THAT NO CONFIRMATION OF THIS VIEW OF THE CONSTITU TION OF THE SALT CAN BE DRAWN FROM THE COMPOSITION OF THE SILVER PRECIPITATE BUT THE PRECIPITATE THAT SHOULD FALL BY THEORY IS THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SILVER NOW NO SUCH SALT EXISTS THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SILVER DESCRIBED BY BERZELIUS CONTAINING THE NEW MODIFICATION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID 274AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID 4 FOURTH OR INSOLUBLE VARIETY OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA WHEN ANY OF THE PRECEDING VARIETIES OF THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA IS HEATED FOR A FEW MINUTES AT A TEMPERATURE APPROACHING BUT NOT AMOUNTING TO LOW RED NESS IT BECOMES ANHYDROUS IF NOT SO BEFORE AND THE WHOLE OF IT BECOMES INSO LUBLE IN WATER WE ARE APT TO OVERHEAT THE SALT IN A CRUCIBLE IF A LAMP BE EMPLOYED I FOUND IT THE MOST CONVENIENT PROCESS TO INTRODUCE A QUANTITY OF THE CRYSTALLIZED BIPHOSPHATE INTO A PLATINUM CRUCIBLE TO PLACE THIS IN SAND CONTAINED IN A HESSIAN CRUCIBLE AND TO PLACE THE WHOLE IN A SITUATION IN AN OPEN FIRE WHERE IT WOULD NOT BE HEATED WITH RAPIDITY THE TIME WAS WATCHED WHEN THE SAND WAS RED HOT TO WITHIN A SMALL SPACE OF THE PLATINUM CRUCIBLE AND THE WHOLE THEN WITHDRAWN FROM THE FIRE THE APPEARANCE OF THE HEATED SALT DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON CIRCUMSTANCES IF THE HEAT BE APPLIED RAPIDLY THE SALT UNDERGOES FUSION ON LOSING ITS TWO ESSENTIAL ATOMS OF WATER AND IS FOUND OF A SLAGGY APPEARANCE AND HARD BUT IF THE HEAT BE APPLIED IN A GRADUAL MANNER THE WATER ESCAPES WITHOUT ANY FUSION THE POWDER MERELY SHRINKS AND AGGREGATES SLIGHTLY TOGETHER IN BOTH STATES THE RESULTING SALT IS THE SAME IT MAY BE REDUCED WITH EASE TO THE MOST IMPALPABLE POWDER AND IN THIS CONDITION IS VERY SLOWLY ACTED UPON BY CONTINUED DIGESTION IN A LARGE QUANTITY OF BOILING WATER WHEN IT DOES DISSOLVE IT APPEARS TO PASS INTO THE PRECEDING VARIETY BUT IT MAY BE INFERRED ANALOGICALLY THAT IF A MORE INTENSE HEAT COULD BE APPLIED TO THE SALT UNDER CONSIDERATION WITHOUT INDUCING ANOTHER CHANGE TO BE DE SCRIBED THE SALT WOULD BE RENDERED PERFECTLY INSOLUBLE THE BIPHOSPHATE OF POTASH AFFORDS THIS ANALOGY THIS LAST SALT CONTAINS ONLY THE TWO ESSENTIAL ATOMS OF WATER WHEN HEATED ABOVE 400 IT BEGINS TO UNDERGO A SEMIFUSION ALTHOUGH THE HEAT HAS BEEN APPLIED IN A GRADUAL IMANNER AND BECOMES PARTIALLY INSOLUBLE WITHOUT EXHIBITING THE CHANGES WHICH PRECEDE THIS IN THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA A STILL HIGHER TEMPE RATURE APPROACHING A RED HEAT RENDERS THE BIPHOSPHATE OF POTASH AS INSOLUBLE AS THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA BUT THE BIPHOSPHATE OF POTASH MAY BE FUSED IN A PLATINUM CRUCIBLE AND HEATED TO WHITENESS WITHOUT UNDERGOING ANY FURTHER CHANGE OF STATE AND AFTER BEING THUS STRONGLY HEATED IT MAY BE REDUCED TO POWDER AND DIGESTED IN BOILING WATER FOR HOURS WITHOUT DISSOLVING TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO AFFORD A SOLUTION CAPABLE OF AFFECTING NITRATE OF SILVER IN A SENSIBLE MANNER IT MAY BE INFERRED THEREFORE THAT IF THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA COULD 275MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES BE SUFFICIENTLY HEATED WATER WOULD BE WHOLLY INCAPABLE OF ACTING UPON IT DILUTE ACIDS HAVE NO ACTION UPON THIS INSOLUBLE VARIETY OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA BUT ALKALIES BY LONG DIGESTION WITHDRAW A PORTION OF THE PHOSPHORIC ACID SO FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE THE ACID APPEARS NOT TO BE IN A MODIFIED OR ALTERED CON DITION 5 FIFTH VARIETY OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA OR METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA WHEN THE PRECEDING INSOLUBLE VARIETY OR THE BIPHOSPHATE IN ANY CONDITION IS HEATED IN A PLATINUM CRUCIBLE TO LOW REDNESS IT UNDERGOES FUSION AND ON COOLING PRESENTS ITSELF AS A TRANSPARENT GLASS WHICH DELIQUESCES IN A DAMP ATMOSPHERE AND IS HIGHLY SOLUBLE IN WATER BUT THE FUSED SALT HAS UNDERGONE A MOST EXTRA ORDINARY AND PERMANENT CHANGE OF PROPERTIES THE SOLUTION HAS A VERY FEEBLE ACID REACTION WHEN COMPARED WITH CRYSTALLIZED BIPHOSPHATE INDEED THE ADDI TION OF 43 ANHYDROUS CARBONATE OF SODA TO ONE HUNDRED FUSED BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA IMPARTED TO THE LATTER A DISTINCT ALKALINE REACTION WHEN THIS SALT IS ADDED TO NITRATE OF SILVER THE PHOSPHORIC ACID IS NEARLY ENTIRELY THROWN DOWN IN GELA TINOUS FLAKES WHICH AGGREGATE TOGETHER AS A SOFT SOLID WHEN HEATED NEAR 2120 AND CORRESPOND IN COMPOSITION WITH THE SODA SALT THIS SILVER PRECIPITATE LOSES ACID WHEN WASHED IT AGREES IN PROPERTIES WITH THE BIPHOSPHATE OF SILVER DESCRIBED BY BERZELIUS WHICH WHEN WASHED APPEARED TO PASS INTO A SESQUI PHOSPHATE HE FORMED IT BY ADDING PHOSPHORIC ACID TO NITRATE OF SILVER BUT THE PHOSPHORIC ACID EMPLOYED BY HIM MUST HAVE BEEN THE GLACIAL ACID RECENTLY DISSOLVED  WHEN THE FUSED BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA IS ADDED TO MURIATE OF BARYTES NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE PHOSPHORIC ACID PRECIPITATES WITH THE BARYTES AS A FLAKY GELA TINOUS PRECIPITATE WHICH CONTAINS ONLY ONE ATOM BARYTES TO THE DOUBLE ATORM PHOSPHORIC ACID LIKE THE SODA SALT BUT ALL THE NEW PROPERTIES OF THIS SALT DEPEND UPON THE ACID HAVING UNDERGONE AN ESSENTIAL CHANGE IN CONSTITUTION THE ACID MAY BE SEPARATED IN THE USUAL WAY NAMELY PRECIPITATING BY ACETATE OF LEAD WASHING THE PHOSPHATE OF LEAD AND DECOMPOSING IT BY A STREAM OF SUL PHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS AFTER EXPOSURE FOR SOME HOURS TO ALLOW THE ESCAPE OF THE SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN THE ACID LIQUID WITHOUT BEING NEUTRALIZED UNIFORMLY PRODUCED AN OPALWHITE FLAKY PRECIPITATE IN MURIATE OF BARYTES WHICH APPEARED  ANNALES DE CHIMIE ET DE PHYSIQUE TOM XLVI P 143 276AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID IMMEDIATELY UNLESS THE LIQUORS WERE VERY DILUTE THIS IS ALSO A CHARACTER I FIND OF PHOSPHORIC ACID RECENTLY IGNITED PER SE THE ACID OF OUR SALT POSSESSES ALSO THE PROPERTY OF COAGULATING ALBUMEN IN FACT THIS ACID APPEARS TO BE THE GLACIAL PHOSPHORIC ACID WHICH HAD BEEN HASTILY ASSUMED BY RECENT WRITERS UPON THIS SUBJECT TO BE THE PYROPHOSPHORIC ACID BUT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT I SHALL TAKE THE LIBERTY TO DESIGNATE PROVISIONALLY THE ACID OF THE FUSED BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA THE METAPHOSPHORIC ACID FROM AN HYPOTHESIS OF ITS CONSTITUTION TO BE IMMEDIATELY EXPLAINED AND THE FUSED SALT ITSELF THE METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA THE METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA IS INSOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL ITS SOLUTION IN WATER IS NOT ALTERED BY TIME AT LEAST NO CHANGE COULD BE PERCEIVED IN A SOLUTION WHICH HAD BEEN KEPT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS WHEN EXPOSED TO A TEMPERATURE NOT EX CEEDING 100 FAHR THE SOLUTION BECOMES VISCID AS IT CONCENTRATES AND FINALLY DRIES INTO A TRANSPARENT BRITTLE PELLICLE LIKE GUM ALL MY ATTEMPTS TO CRY STALLIZE THIS SALT BY SLOW EVAPORATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE OR BY MEANS OF THE AIR PUMP HAVE FAILED IT NEVER PRESENTED THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF CRYSTALLIZATION BUT MANY OF THE INSOLUBLE METAPHOSPHATES FALL DOWN IN THE STATE OF HYDRATES WHICH HAVE THE FLUID FORM WHICH MAY ALSO BE THE FORM THAT THE SODA SALT IS DISPOSED TO ASSUME THE HYDRATED METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA DRIED OVER SULPHURIC ACID IN THE VACUUM OF AN AIRPUMP AT THE ORDINARY TEMPERATURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE WAS FOUND TO CONSIST OF METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA   100 WATER    1086 BY AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH 1164 GRAINS OF THE HYDRATED SALT LOST 114 BY FUSION AT A RED HEAT THIS IS 122 ATOMIC PROPORTION OF WATER WHEN HEATED TO 400 THE HYDRATED SALT APPEARS TO RETAIN 1 ATOM OF WATER AND TO PASS INTO THE BIPYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA 1394 GRAINS DRIED ON THE SOLDER BATH AT 400 FOR SEVERAL DAYS RETAINED 106 WATER OR THE SALT CONSISTED OF BIPHOSPHATE OF SODA  100 WATER  823 10823 THIS IS LESS THAN ONE PROPORTION OF WATER 8089 BUT THE ADDITIONAL LOSS OF WATER MDCCCXXXIII 2 O 277MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES WHICH THE SALT SUSTAINED IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT WAS EXPOSED TO THE HEAT WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF CONVERTING A SMALL PORTION OF IT INTO THE INSOLUBLE AND ANHYDROUS VARIETY THE DRIED SALT WHEN DISSOLVED IN WATER GAVE WITH NITRATE OF SILVER A CHALKY WHITE HEAVY PRECIPITATE WHICH EVI DENTLY WAS NOT THE USUAL METAPHOSPHATE OF SILVER A PORTION OF THE SALT WAS THEREFORE PRECIPITATED BY ACETATE OF LEAD AND THE ACID LIBERATED IN THE USUAL MANNER THE ACID DID NOT DISTURB ALBUMEN NOR PRECIPITATE MURIATE OF BARYTES BUT WHEN NEIUTRALIZED WITH CAUSTIC SODA IT GAVE EXCELLENT CRYSTALS OF THE PYRO PHOSPHATE OF SODA THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THEREFORE THAT THE METAPHOSPHORIC ACID HAS RETURNED TO THE CONDITION OF PYROPHOSPHORIC ACID THE QUESTION ARISES IS THIS TRANSITION THE CONSEQUENCE OF MERELY EXPOSING THE METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA TO A PARTICULAR TEMPERATURE 400 OR DOES THE WATER INTERFERE AND THE TRANSITION ARISE FROM THE AFFINITY OF PHOSPHORIC ACID FOR WATER AS A BASE WITH SODA NOW UPON TRIAL THE ANHYDROUS FUSED METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA AS IT IS FIRST FORMED WAS FOUND TO UNDERGO NO ALTERATION WHEN KEPT FOR SEVERAL DAYS BETWEEN 400 AND 600 THE CHANGE IS THEREFORE PECULIAR TO THE HYDRATED SALT AND EFFECTED BY THE INTERFERENCE OF THE WATER A SOLUTION OF THE METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA MAY BE TREATED WITH CAUSTIC SODA AND EVEN BOILED WITH IT WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF THE ACID AT LEAST THE SALINE SOLUTION STILL PRECIPITATES SILVER WHITE AND THE ACID WHEN SEPARATED COAGULATES ALBUMEN THE SOLUTION MAY EVEN BE EVAPORATED GENTLY TO DRYNESS WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ACID BUT IF DRIED BY A SHARP SANDBATH HEAT AND IF THE ALKALI BE PRESENT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY THE COMMON SUBPHOSPHATE OF SODA IS FORMED THE METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA FORMS A SERIES OF INSOLUBLE METAPHOSPHATES WHEN ADDED TO SOLUTIONS OF THE EARTHY AND METALLIC SALTS METAPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES THE METAPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES HAS ALREADY BEEN ALLUDED TO AS THIS SALT IS SOLUBLE IN AN EXCESS OF THE METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA IT IS BEST PREPARED BY ADDING THAT SALT TO MTURIATE OF BARYTES IN EXCESS THERE IS AN ABUNDANT WHITE FLAKY PRECIPITATE AND THE MOTHERLIQUOR REMAINS ACID THIS PRECIPITATE WASHED AND DRIED AT 600 FAHR FORMED BRITTLE MASSES THESE MASSES HEATED TO REDNESS GIVE OFF WATER AND UNDERGO AN IMPERFECT FUSION 1186 GRAINS OF THE IGNITED SALT 278AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID WERE DISSOLVED WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY BY PURE NITRIC ACID AND THEN PRECI PITATED BY SULPHATE OF SODA THE SULPHATE OF BARYTES AMOUNTED TO 969 GRAINS WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO 636 GRAINS BARYTES THE COMPOSITION OF THIS METAPHOS PHATE AND OF A BIPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES IS AS FOLLOWS METAPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES BIPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES BARYTES   5362   5175 PHOSPHORIC ACID  4638  4825 100 100 OUR SALT IS THEREFORE 187 PER CENT DEFICIENT IN PHOSPHORIC ACID I THOUGHT THAT MURIATE OF BARYTES HAD PERHAPS BEEN CARRIED DOWN BY THE PRECIPITATE BUT ON EXAMINING A PORTION I FOUND IT FREE OF MURIATIC ACID BUT ANOTHER QUANTITY OF THE METAPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES WAS PREPARED WITH THE PRECAUTION OF HAVING A MORE DECIDED EXCESS OF MURIATE OF BARYTES AND THE LIQUORS LESS DILUTE 661 GRAINS OF THE IGNITED SALT YIELDED 524 GRAINS SULPHATE OF BARYTES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO 344 GRAINS BARYTES THIS SPECIMEN THERE FORE CONSISTED OF BARYTES     5204 METAPHOSPHORIC ACID   4796 100 WHICH WILL BE FOUND ON COMPARISON TO CORRESPOND VERY CLOSELY WITH THE BIPHOS PHATE OF BARYTES THE METAPHOSPHATES IN GENERAL PRECIPITATE WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY FRONM VERY DILUTE SOLUTIONS ALTHOUGH WHEN ONCE PRECIPITATED THEY ARE HIGHLY INSO LUBLE THE LAST WASHINGS OF THE METAPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES HOT WATER BEING EMPLOYED CONTAINED NO SENSIBLE TRACE OF BARYTES FOR THEY HAD NO EFFECT UPON A SULPHATE HENCE THE METAPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES IS AN INSOLUBLE SALT THE METAPHOSPLIATE OF BARYTES MAY BE BOILED IN WATER FOR TWO HOURS WITHOUT SENSIBLE CHANGE BUT IT THEN BEGINS TO DISSOLVE AND THE SOLUTION PROCEEDS AT AN ACCELERATED RATE TILL EVENTUALLY THE WHOLE DISAPPEARS THE RESULTING SOLUTION IS STRONGLY ACID AND CERTAINLY CONTAINS BIPHOSPHATE OF BARYTES FOR IT PRECIPI TATES SILVER YELLOW WE HAVE HERE THEREFORE AN INSTANCE OF AN INSOLUBLE META PHOSPHATE PASSING INTO A SOLUBLE PHOSPHATE 2O2 279MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES METAPHOSPHATE OF LIME ON ADDING METAPHOSPHATE OF SODA TO MURIATE OF LIME IN EXCESS A PRECIPITATE APPEARS LIKE WHAT OCCURS ON THROWING INTO WATER A SOLUTION OF AN ESSENTIAL OIL IN ALCOHOL A TRANSPARENT SEMIFLUID BODY OF THE CONSISTENCY OF PITCH COLLECTS AT THE BOTTOM WHICH IS A HYDRATE OF THE METAPHOSPHATE OF LIME IN THE LIQUIDD FORM BUT INSOLUBLE IN WATER THIS SALT APPEARS TO HAVE OCCURRED TO BERZELIUS AND IS DESCRIBED IN HIS PAPER ON THE PHOSPHATES HE FORMED IT BY PRECIPI TATING MURIATE OF LIME BY METAPHOSPHORIC ACID BUT DID NOT OBSERVE THE CIR CUMSTANCES NECESSARY TO INSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE PROCESS IV OF THE MODJFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER OF PHOSPHORIC ACID WHICH EXISTS IN COMMON PHOS PHATE OF SODA AS COMPARED WITH THE OTHER MODIFICATIONS IS A DISPOSITION TO FORM SALTS WHICH CONTAIN THREE ATOMS OF BASE TO THE DOUBLE ATOM OF ACID OF THESE SALTS THE MOST REMARKABLE IS THE YELLOW SUBPHOSPHATE OF SILVER WHICH THE SOLUBLE PHOSPHATES PRECIPITATE WHEN ADDED TO NITRATE OF SILVER THIS ACID DOES NOT AFFECT ALBUMEN AND THE OTHER MODIFICATIONS PASS DIRECTLY INTO THE CONDI TION OF THIS ACID ON KEEPING THEIR AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS FOR SOME DAYS AND MORE RAPIDLY ON BOILING THESE SOLUTIONS OR UPON FUSING THE OTHER MODIFICATIONS OR THEIR SALTS WITH AT LEAST THREE PROPORTIONS OF FIXED BASE PYROPHOSPHORIC ACID OR THE ACID WHICH EXISTS IN THE FUSED PHOSPHATE OF SODA IS REMARKABLY DISPOSED TO FORM SALTS HAVING TWO ATOMS BASE WHICH IS THE CON STITUTION OF THE WHITE PYROPHOSPHATE OF SILVER FORMED ON TESTING THE PYROPHOS PHATE OF SODA WITH A SALT OF SILVER SUCH SALTS OF THE PRECEDING ACID AS CONTAIN NO MORE THAN TWO ATOMS OF FIXED BASE PASS INTO PYROPHOSPHATES WHEN HEATED TO REDNESS THE ACID UNDER CONSIDERATION WHEN FREE DOES NOT DISTURB ALBU MEN NOR PRODUCE A PRECIPITATE IN MURIATE OF BARYTES THE METAPHOSPHORIC ACID IS DISPOSED TO FORM SALTS WHICH CONTAIN ONE ATOM OF BASE TO THE DOUBLE ATOM OF ACID THE OTHER MODIFICATIONS PASS INTO RIETA PHOSPHORIC ACID WHEN HEATED TO REDNESS PER SE OR WHEN

ACID WHEN FREE OCCASIONS PRECIPITATES IN SOLUTIONS OF THE SALTS OF BARYTES AND OF MOST OF THE OTHER EARTHS AND METALLIC OXIDES AND FORMS AN INSOLUBLE COMPOUND WITH ALBUMEN THE GLACIAL OR METAPHOSPHORIC ACID APPEARS TO BE CAPABLE OF DISSOLVING IN GENERAL ONLY ABOUT FOUR FIFTHS OF THE QUANTITY OF CARBONATE OF SODA WHICH IT CAN DECOMPOSE WHEN CONVERTED INTO PHOSPHORIC ACID BUT A LARGE QUANTITY OF THE METAACID PASSES INTO PHOSPHORIC ACID ON UNITING WITH THE ALKALI AND THE SOLUTION DEPOSITS PHOSPHATE OF SODA IN TUFTS COMPOSED OF FINE CRYSTALLINE PLATES OF A SILKY LUSTRE THE SALT PRESENTED ITSELF OF THIS APPEARANCE IT WILL BE REMEMBERED IN THE CASE OF A SOLUTION OF PHOSPHATE OF SODA WHICH HAD BEEN BOILED FOR A LONG TIME IN A GLASS VESSEL THE LIQUID ABOUT THE CRYSTALS IN THE PRESENT CASE STILL CONTAINED METAPHOSPHORIC ACID NOW IT IS A MATTER OF CERTAINTY THAT IF WE TAKE ONE COMBINING PROPORTION OF AINY MODIFICATION OF PHOSPHORIC ACID AND FUSE IT WITH SODA OR ITS CARBONATE WE SHALL FORM A METAPHOSPHATE A PYROPHOSPHATE OR A PHOSPHATE ACCORDING AS WE EMPLOY ONE TWO OR THREE PROPORTIONS OF BASE THE ACID WHEN SEPARATED FROM THE BASE WILL POSSESS AND RETAIN FOR SOME TIME THE CHARACTERS OF ITS PECULIAR MODIFICATION IT WOULD APPEAR THEREFORE THAT THE ACID IS IMPRESSED WITH A DIS POSITION TO FORM DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SALTS BY THE PROPORTION OF BASE TO WHICH IT HAS BEEN UNITED AND THAT IT RETAINS THIS DISPOSITION EVEN WHEN LIBERATED FROMR THE ORIGINAL COMPOUND BUT I SUSPECT THAT THE MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID WHEN IN WHAT WE WOULD CALL A FREE STATE ARE STILL IN COMBINATION WITLH THEIR USUAL PROPORTION OF BASE AND THAT THAT BASE IS WATER THUS THE THREE MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID MAY BE COMPOSED AS FOLLOWS PHOSPHORIC ACID  H3 P PYROPHOSPHORIC ACID  H2  METAPHOSPHORIC ACID    H P OR THEY ARE RESPECTIVELY A TERPHOSPHATE A BIPHOSPHATE AND PHOSPHATE OF WATER NOW WHEN ONE OF THESE COMPOUNDS IS TREATED WITH A STRONG BASE THE WHOLE OR A PART OF THE WATER IS SUPPLANTED BUT THE AMOUNT OF BASE IN COMBINATION WITH THE ACID REMAINS UNALTERED THERE ARE THUS THREE SETS OF PHOSPHATES IN WHICH THE OXYGEN IN THE ACID BEING FIVE THE NG OXYGEN IN THE BASE IS THREE TWO AND ONE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ACIDS AND OF THE SALTS OF SODA WHICH THEY FORM IS EXHI BITED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE 281282 MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES OXYGEN IN SODA WATER ACID

TILL THE WATER IS REDUCED TO THE PROPORTION OF THREE ATOMS AT WHICH STAGE THE ACID ASSUMES A DARK COLOUR AND IS OF THE CONSISTENCE OF TREACLE WHEN COLD BUT MUCH MORE FLUID WHEN HOT IN THIS CONDITION THE ACID GIVES AN UNMIXED YELLOW PRECIPITATE WITH SILVER AND IS ENTIRELY PHOSPHORIC ACID BY EXPOSURE FOR SEVEN DAYS OVER SULPHURIC ACID IN THE VACUUM OF AN AIRPUMP THE WATER WAS REDUCED TO 435 PARTS AND ALMLOST THE WHOLE OF THE ACID HAD CRYSTALLIZED IN THIN PLATES WHICH WERE DELIQUESCENT IN THE EXTREME AND WHICH THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE WERE THE TERHYDRATE BY A PROTRACTED EX POSURE TO 3000 OR 320 THE ACID CONTINUES TO LOSE WATER BUT MUCH MORE SLOWLY AT 460 THE WATER WAS QUICKLY REDUCED TO 344 PARTS OR LITTLE MORE THAN 2 ATOMS IN AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED IN AN OPEN CRUCIBLE AND THE ACID NOW PRECIPITATED SILVER WHITE WITH A TRACE OF YELLOW BUT WHEN NEUTRALIZED BY CARBONATE OF SODA IT AFFORDED CRYSTALLINE PLATES OF PHOSPHATE OF SODA AMONG WHICH NO CRYSTALS OF PYROPHOSPHATE EXISTED BUT IT MAY BE DEEMED POSSI BLE FROM THIS RESULT THAT A HYDRATE OF PHOSPHORIC ACID EXISTS CONTAINING 2 ATOMS WATER TO 1 ATOM ACID WHICH IS 8 ATOMS BASE TO 3 ATOMS ACID THE PRO PORTION OF BASE TO ACID IN THE SALT TERMED BY BERZELIUS THE PHOSPHATE OFAND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID LIME OF BONES IN ANOTHER CASE IN WHICH THE EVAPORATION WAS CONDUCTED MUCH MORE SLOWLY IN A PLATINUM FLASK THE ABOVE COMPOUND WAS CERTAINLY NOT FORINED BUT THE EVAPORATION AT 415 AFTER ADVANCING FOR SEVERAL DAYS SEEMED TO CEASE ENTIRELY WHEN THE WATER WAS REDUCED TO 299 PARTS WHICH IS VERY NEARLY 2 ATOMS OF WATER ACID AT THIS DEGREE OF CONCENTRATION NEUTRALIZED AS USUAL BY AMMONIA GAVE WITH SILVER A CHALKY WHITE PRECIPITATE WITHOUT A SHADE OF YELLOW WHICH SUGGESTS THE IDEA THAT AN ACID HYDRATE OF 2 WATER MAY EXIST HAVING A CORRESPONDING SILVER SALT ACID SO FAR CONCENTRATED WHEN NEUTRALIZED BY CARBONATE OF SODA AFFORDED A MIXTURE OF CRYSTALS OF PHOSPHATE AND PYROPHOSPHATE OF SODA IN WHICH THE LATTER PREDOMINATED FOR THE PRO DUCTION OF METAPHOSPHORIC ACID THE CONCENTRATION OF A MUCH HIGHLER TEMPERA TURE WAS REQUISITE BUT THIS ACID WAS OBSERVED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE PROPORTION OF WATER HAD FALLEN UNDER 2 ATOMS NAMELY WHEN IT AMOUNTED TO 2805 PER CENT IN ONE EXPERIMENT BY THE GREATEST HEAT OF THE SANDBATH WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLY ABOVE THE MELTING POINT OF LEAD THE PROPORTION OF WATER WAS RE DUCED A LITTLE UNDER 2 ATOMS NAMELY TO 2299 PARTS AND THE ACID THEN CON TAINED ABUNDANCE OF METAPHOSPHORIC ACID AS EVINCED BY ITS POWER TO COAGULATE ALBUMEN IN THE GLACIAL PHOSPHORIC ACID DULONG FOUND 100 ACID UNITED WITH 206 WATER AND ROSE 100 ACID WITH ONLY 1042 WATER THE LATTER DETERMINA TION FALLS SHORT OF 1 ATOM WATER AND WOULD INDICATE THAT PHOSPHOLIC ACID MAY BE RENDERED PARTIALLY ANHYDROUS BY HEAT I DO NOT ENTER UPON THE DETAILS OF MY EXPERIMENTS ON THE HYDRATES OF PHOSPHORIC ACID AS THE SUBJECT IS DIFFI CULT AND REQUIRES A MUCH MORE MINUTE INVESTIGATION THAN I HAVE AS YET HAD IT IN MY POWER TO GIVE IT ALTHOUGH OF OPINION THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PHOSPHORIC ACID AND THAT THE MODIFICATIONS ARE ENTIRELY DUE TO THE QUANTITY OF WATER COMBINED WITH THE ACID I HAVE STILL RETAINED THE NAMES WHICH HAVE CONME INTO USE AND EVEN PRO POSED A THIRD MZETAPHOSPHORIC ACID IMPLYING MERELY THAT THE ACID TO WHICH THIS NAME IS APPLIED IS PHOSPHORIC ACID WITH SOMETHING ELSE NAMELY WITH AN ATOM OF WATER AS THE CLASSES OF SALTS WHICH THE ACID HYDRATES FORM ARE QUITE DISTINCT THESE TRIVIAL NAMES ARE PRACTICALLY CONVENIENT AND MAY BE ADOPTED PROVISIONALLY TILL CHEMISTS ARE PREPARED BY AN EXTENDED KNOWLEDGE OF THE SALTS TO INNOVATE UPON THEIR NOMENCLATURE WITH MORE ADVANTAGE THAN CAN BE DONE AT PRESENT 283284 MR GRAHAM ON THE ARSENIATES PHOSPHATES C I MAY BE ALLOWED TO STATE BEFORE CONCLUDING THAT THE BINARSENIATE OF SODA DOES NOT APPEAR TO UNDERGO THE SAME REMARKABLE CHANGES AS THE BIPHOSPHATE AT LEAST AFTER BEING EXPOSED TO HEAT OF VARIOUS DEGREES OF INTENSITY IT CONTINUED TO GIVE THE USUAL BROWN SUBARSENIATE WITH NITRATE OF SILVER BUT ARSENIC ACID EXHIBITS A WEAKER AFFINITY FOR WATER THAN PHOSPHORIC ACID AND IS READILY IIADE ANHYDROUS BY HEAT

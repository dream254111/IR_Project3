j100000,Science,1639057,Which of the Present Members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Have Held the Longest Continuous Membership,i296415,DECEMBER 3 1915 I have tried to bring before you the pos sibilities of causal morphology partly be cause the same attention has never been given to it in this country as to other branches of botany and partly because if morphology be conceived in this broader spirit it need not be said that it has no practical bearing I should not regard it as a serious disability were the study of purely scientific interest only but this is not the case When if ever we penetrate into the secrets of organization so far as to be able to modify the organism at will and genetics has advanced in this direction the practical possibilities become incal culable Probably all of us have reflected on what changes the war may bring to botanical work It is impossible to forecast this but I should like to emphasize what my pre decessor said in his address last year as to pure science being the root from which ap plied science must spring Though results may seem far off we must not slacken but redouble our efforts towards the solution of the fundamental problems of the organism This can be done without any antagonism between pure and applied botany indeed there is every advantage in conducting in vestigations on plants of economic impor tance It would be well if every botanist made himself really familiar with some limited portion of applied botany so as to be able to give useful assistance and advice at need The stimulus to investigation would amply repay the time required Even in continuing to devote ourselves to pure botany we can not afford to waste time and energy in purposeless work It is written in Alice in Wonderland that no wise fish goes anywhere without a por poise and this might hang as a text in every research laboratory A plant is a very mysterious and wonder ful thing and our business as botanists is to try to understand and explain it as a whole and to avoid being bound by any conventional views of the moment We have to think of the plant as at once a physicochemical mechanism and as a living being to avoid either treating it as some thing essentially different from nonliving matter or forcibly explaining it by the physics and chemistry of today It is an advantage of the study of causal morphol ogy that it requires us to keep the line be tween these two crudities a line that may some day lead us to a causal explanation of the developing plant and the beginnings of a single science of botany W H LANG UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER WHICH OF THE PRESENT MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE HAVE HELD THE LONGEST CONTINU OUS MEMBERSHIP THIS is a

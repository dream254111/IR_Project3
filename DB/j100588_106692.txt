J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106692,ON THE METHOD OF CORRESPONDENT VALUES C BY EDWARD WARING M D F R S AND LUCASIAN PROFESSOR OF THE MATHEMATICS AT CAMBRIDGE,I206941,166 XVII ON THE METHOD OF CORRESPONDENT VALUES C BY EDWARD WARING M D F R S AND LUCASIAN PROFESSOR OF THE MA THEMATICS AT CAMBRIDGE READ MAY 28 1789 1 1 IN THE YEAR 1762 I PUBLISHED A METHOD OF FINDING WHEN TWO ROOTS OF A GIVEN EQUATION XN  PXN1  QXN2  RXN3  C  O ARE EQUAL BY FINDING THE COMMON DIVISORS OF THE TWO QUANTITIES AN  PAN1  QAN2  C AND NAN1  N  1PAN2  N  2QAN3  C AND OBSERVED IF THEY ADMITTED ONLY ONE SIMPLE DIVISOR A  A THEN TWO ROOTS WERE ONLY EQUAL IF A QUADRATIC A2  AA B THEN TWO ROOTS OF THE EQUATION BECAME TWICE EQUAL IF A CUBIC A3  AA2  BA  C THEN TWO ROOTS BECAME THRICE EQUAL AND SO ON OR TO EXPRESS IN MORE GENERAL TERMS WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THE SAME PRINCIPLES IF THE COMMON DIVISOR BE A  BR X A  CS X A  DT X C THEN R  1 ROOTS OF THE GIVEN EQUATION WILL BE B S  1 ROOTS WILL BE C T  1 WILL BE D C AND IT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWS FROM THE PRINCIPLES DELIVERED IN THE SECOND EDITION OF THE SAME BOOK PUBLISHED IN 1770 THAT TO FIND WHEN R  1 V  1 T  1 C ROOTS ARE RESPECTIVELY EQUAL REQUIRES R  S  T C EQUATIONS OF CONDITION WHICH ARE DEDU CIBLE FROM THE WELL KNOWN METHOD OF FINDING THE COMMON DIVISORS OF TWO QUANTITIES IN THIS CASE OF AN  PAN1  QAN2  C NAN1  N  1PAN2  N  2QAN3  C OF THE TERMS OF THEIR REMAINDERS C INDR WARING ON THE METHOD C 167 IN THE BOOK ABOVE MENTIONED THE EQUATIONS OF CONDITION ARE GIVEN WHICH DISCOVER WHEN TWO ROOTS ARE EQUAL IN THE EQUATIONS X3  PX2  QX  R  0 X  QX2  RX  S  0 X5  QX8  RX2  SX  T  0 IN THE TWO LATTER EQUATIONS THE SECOND TERM IS WANTING WHICH MAY EASILY BE EXTERMINATED BUT IT MAY AS EASILY BE RESTORED BY SUBSTITUTING FOR Q R S C IN THE EQUATION OF CONDITION FOUND THE QUANTITIES RESULTING FROM THE COMMON TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS TO DESTROY THE SECOND TERM 2 ANOTHER RULE CONTAINED IN THE SAME BOOK IS THE SUBSTITU TION OF THE ROOTS OF THE EQUATION NAN  1  N  1 PAN  2  N  2QAN3  C  0 RESPECTIVELY FOR A IN THE QUANTITY AN  PAN1  QAN2  C AND MULTIPLICATION OF ALL THE QUANTITIES RESULTING INTO EACH OTHER THEIR CONTENT WILL GIVE THE EQUATION OF CONDITION WHEN TWO ROOTS ARE EQUAL MR HUDDE FIRST DISCOVERED THAT IF THE SUCCESSIVE TERMS OF THE GIVEN EQUATION ARE MULTIPLIED INTO AN ARITHMETICAL SERIES THE RESULTING EQUATION WILL CONTAIN ONE OF ANY TWO EQUAL ROOTS AND M OF THE M  1 EQUAL ROOTS IN THE GIVEN EQUATION 3 IF 3 4 5 R ROOTS THE EQUATION ARE EQUAL FIND A COMMON DIVISOR OF 3 4 5 R OF THE SUBSEQUENT QUANTITIES AN  PAN1  QAN2  C NAN1  N  1 PAN2  N  2QAN3  C N N  1 AN2  N  1 N  2PAN3  N  2 N  3QAN4  N  3 N  4RAN5  C N N  1 N  2AN3  N  1 N  2 N  3PAN4  N  2 N  3 N  4QAN5  C N N  1 N  2 N  R  2ANR1  N  1 N  2 N  R  1PANR  C WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE BEST DONE BY DIVIDING ALL THE PRECEDING QUANTITIES BY THE QUANTITY OF THE LEAST DIMENSION OF A AND THE DIVISOR AND ALL THE REMAINDERS BY THAT QUANTITY WHICH HAS THE LEAST DIMENSIONS AMONGST THEM AND SO ON THERE WILL RESULT 2 3 4 R  1 EQUATIONS OF CONDITION AND IN THIS CASE IT IS D D 2 OBSERVED168 DR WARING ON THE OBSERVED IN THE BEFOREMENTIONED BOOK THAT IF THE COMMON DIVISOR BE A  A IT WILL ONCE ONLY ADMIT OF 3 4 5 R EQUAL ROOTS IF IT BE A QUADRATIC THEN IT WILL TWICE ADMIT OF THOSE EQUAL ROOTS AND SO ON 4 IF THE ROOTS OF THE EQUATION OF THE LEAST DIMENSIONS BE SUBSTITUTED FOR A IN THE REMAINING EQUATIONS AND EACH OF THE RESULTING VALUES OF THE SAME EQUATION BE MULTIPLIED INTO EACH OTHER THERE WILL RESULT THE R  1 EQUATIONS OF CONDITION AND THE SAME MAY BE DEDUCED ALSO FROM THE SEVERAL EQUATIONS CON JOINTLY THE EQUATIONS OF CONDITIONS FOUND BY THE FIRST METHOD IF THE DIVISIONS WERE NOT PROPERLY INSTITUTED MAY ADMIT OF MORE RATIONAL DIVISORS THAN NECESSARY OF WHICH SOME ARE THE EQUATIONS OF CONDITIONS REQUIRED 2 1 IN THE YEAR 1776 I PUBLISHED IN THE MEDITATIONES ANA LYTICAE A NEW METHOD OF DIFFERENCES FOR

to take much time in the preliminary presentation of a currency argument because most of us understand pretty well the failings of our present system But because of the different ways of phrasing the trouble and because I want to establish a premise upon which to work I must take a little time to place before you my understanding of the economic cause of the failure of our present banking machinery This is more necessary because I believe that any speaker for the negative does only half his work when he tears down the ideas of the supporter of any question leaving only a mass of antagonistic argument without any suggested reconstruction Under our present system by far the greatest part of our circu lating medium is no longer a government promise to paya handtohand hard money Aboutgo per cent of our business is transacted by a comparatively new money check transfer of bank credit The volume of this new money is very elastic and the clearinghouse reports show how closely it fluctuates in accord with business activity or the money demand Therefore we may justly claim that about go per cent of our circulating money is already almost ideally elastic If we analyze the combined statement of our whole banking system we see at once that two items bear a distinct relation to each other the loans on the asset side and the deposits on the liability side This is the endless chain of our banking machinery Loans made in the whole scheme create deposits and the expan sion or contraction of one is followed by an expansion or con traction of the other Now the important thing to remember in this connection is that when a bank a group of banks or a whole banking system comes before us for its last analysis we find that a demand liability has been created in exchange for a comparatively I A paper read before the Western Economic Association at Chicago November II I9II 4I42 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY longtime asset The depositors have been given a right to demand an immediate cash payment in return for which they as a body have given the banks their paper maturing in thirty sixty or ninety days or even longer maturities Any student of commercial credit in analyzing any statement knows that there must be a reasonable ratio between quick liabilities and quick assets In his world thirty sixty or ninetyday paper is a quick asset if good but who would dare call it quick as compared to the immediate needs of a bank for currency during financial panic  While the vast number of bank depositors are content to use checks in their business operations most of the time there come times of doubt when these same depositors revert to a desire for government money They want the hard cash This unrest is due to an undefined and indefinite doubt as to the ability of the banks to make cash payments as freely as demanded Fortunately this dread is not generally long lived and when they become con vinced that they can really get a hardcash money freely their desire for the same ordinarily abates Now what this system of ours needs is some equalizing mechan ism that will tend to restore the monetary balance between quick assets and quick liabilities in time of stress What we really want is some way of using the comparatively longtime assets of our banking system by some elastic temporary transfer into a hand tohand bearer money of unquestioned value and acceptability The need for some method of accomplishing this is what first prompted the AldrichVreeland Bill and then resulted in the creation of the National Monetary Commission and if this can be brought about we shall need little else to alleviate our monetary cropmoving stringencies or panic conditions due at present to the inability of our banks to supply a handtohand money at times of extraordinary demand Almost all students of finance are agreed that there must be some central source from which this elasticity may be secured The centralbank plan has time and again been advanced as the scientific solution of the difficulty But the people of this country rightly demand that any such plan must first provide clearly three things First this central mechanism must be absolutely beyondTHE ALDRICH PLAN A MONETARY GERRYMANDER 43 the control of selfish financial interests Second every part of the country must receive impartial assistance in time of financial stress Third it must be clearly shown that the mechanism of the plan is so designed that it will develop automatically with the changing economic conditions of the country entirely independent of any prearranged board of control Now with this in mind and I think you will agree with me that this premise is a safe one to stand on I wish to analyze two features of the plan of Mr Aldrich that in my opinion do not measure up to the standard that should be rigidly required of any plan so vastly different from what we now have These particular features are those referring to the fifteen districts and the directors of the Reserve Association In the original plan fifteen districts were mentioned and no provision was made for any change to accommodate the countrys economic growth This has been remedied to a certain extent by arranging to allow the directors to increase the number of districts But no mention is made of where the original fifteen districts will be or how they will be selected We have only one thing to guide us in estimating what these districts may be and that is the logical analysis of the rest of the plan All through this scheme we find that directors of local associations and the district associations and the central associa tion are elected in two ways one senatorial and the other repre sentative This representative plan is so prominent throughout the bill that we must perforce believe that each district must contain about the same amount of bank capital in order to have the banks fairly represented on the central board Senate document No 225 for the Sixtyfirst Congress second session being a set of charts issued by the monetary commission gives on p I 7 the total capital of all banks reporting as of April 28 I909 as I79398432500 I use these figures because it is presumably from these statistics that Senator Aldrich formulated his report If we are correct then in our logic each district must contain at first onefifteenth of the total bank capital which would be II9598955 We may then use iI9500000 as a unit in attempting to ascertain the general disposition of the fifteen districts44 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY In its charts of banking conditions the commission has used six main divisions of the country namely New England eastern states southern states middle western states western states and Pacific states In round figures the total banking capital of this country is divided among these groups about as follows New England  I38400000 Eastern states  58I370000 Southern states297137000 Middle western states  509622000 Western states  II8075000 Pacific states  149279000 Now if we apply to this our district unit of measure II 9500000 we shall ascertain how many districts should logically be in each of the foregoing geographical divisions of the country This would result in the following New Englandi Idistrict Eastern states   5 districts Southern states  3 districts Middle western states 4 districts Western states  i district Pacific states  i district With this as the logical districting in mind I now wish to turn to that part of the plan relating to the directors of the Reserve Association Here we find first six exofticio members who are not directly regulated by the district plan Second in Section I5 we find an additional fifteen directors one from each district on the senatorial basis This would result in the various divisions having directors as follows New England  I Eastern states  5 Southern states  3 Middle western states  4 Western states  I Pacific states  I Total  I5 The third subdivision of this general article Section i6 of the bill calls for twelve additional directors elected by voting representa tives of the various districts each representative casting a numberTHE ALDRICH PLAN A MONETARY GERRYMANDER 45 of votes equal to the number of shares in the National Reserve Association held by the banks in his district As the number of shares held by any bank is in direct proportion to its capital stock a comparison of the stock in the various geographic divisions already mentioned will show their proportionate vote and the percentage of these twelve directors that would be elected from that part of the country We must of course adjust the fractions and the following table represents the percentage of capital in one section to the whole countrys capital and the number of directors that would be elected under this section of the bill from the geo graphic sections of the country Percentage No of of Capital Directors New England  8 I

additional twelve directors elected by the board so far provided for It is fair to presume that in this selection the ordinary laws of nature will work out and that of these twelve to be elected the proportion from the various sections of the country will be about the same as that represented by the members already elected The following table gives the number of directors elected under Sections

various geographic sections of the country under Section I7 now under consideration A combination of these tables will show that the board would be made up of directors in the following proportion from the various geographic divisions of the country New England  3 Eastern states   I3 Southern states   7 Middle western states  IO Western states   3 Pacific states  3 Total  39 Exofficio members  6 Total for board   45 Now the main objection in the minds of the people against any central bank has been due to fear of a control of the direction and policy of that bank by one class of business interest The people are afraid that the speculative interests of the money centers and of New York in particular will be able to dominate any central organization The very elaborate organization plan of Senator Aldrich has been very widely advertised as a sure preventive of this condition The analysis just made indicates if there is any weight to be attached to a logical analysis of his plan that one third of the elected directors must at first come from the eastern states The second monetary center of the country lies in the Middle West and the speculative interests have nearly as complete a control here as they have in New York The eastern and middle western states have a clear majority of the board of directors and we may rest assured that they would use every bit of latitude allowed them to direct the power of this central bankers bank for that is in truth all Senator Aldrichs Central Reserve Association is so as to serve the interests of their invested capital Now it is quite possible indeed the revised suggestions indicate that it is very probable that the districts will not be designated exactly as supposed in the foregoing argument This indication lies in Section i8 which states Not more than three of theTHE ALDRICH PLAN A MONETARY GERRYMANDER 47 directors elected under paragraphs i6 and I7 shall be chosen from one district This refers to the twentyseven directors chosen on the stockrepresentative basis and was not in the original bill It would seem to me to be put in so as to insure the impossibility of the stockrepresentative votes of the monetary centers losing their weight You can see that it is no longer necessary to have the actual districts located in or touching the monetary centers as it is clearly stated that three directors can be elected from one district a thing which by the ambiguity of the first phrasing was tacitly understood to be impossible Now the main plea of the commission has been to keep the consideration of this question on a nonpartisan unpolitical basis To do this when the time for political activity and election comes we must have an absolutely nonpartisan and unpolitical measure for the peoples considerationa measure that neither party need fear and both can support I am afraid that the plan under con sideration will be considered as an attempt to concentrate the whole banking reserve of the country and place it under the direc tion of a comparatively small board of control The movement of public sentiment in this country is at present absolutely set against any centralization of power in any industry and will surely be set against any centralization of financial power After this you have a right to ask me if we can suggest to the people a nonpartisan unpolitical unconcentrated plan I firmly believe we can suggest such a plan and one that we have tried and found workable So far this country has developed its currency scheme by a system of compromises until we have the hodgepodge inelastic money of today But this very condition has helped develop our wonderfully elastic check currency This is our chief medium of exchange and over it we have developed a most perfect system of controlthe local clearinghouse Why do we need to go farther than the panic of I907 to find a way of meeting and preventing stringency and monetary panic Surely there can be no question that the potential power of our clearinghouse system used at that timeused illegally perhaps but used in a thoroughly American mannersolved the question of monetizing our assets for a time long enough to satisfy the public and calm the panic conditions48 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY Now I believe we should not look the gift horse in the face and turn away I believe we have developed a machinery to suit our needs which with a little adapting and organizing can be made an instrument thoroughly well suited to our needs and absolutely beyond any possibility of sectional capitalistic or political control I do not believe it is necessary or advisable to build up some entirely new machine with none of its joints tested even if England France and Germany use a somewhat similar thing I believe our system has developed our own remedy and that it stands ready to our hand waiting adoption Of course it needs some develop ment and adaptation I wish I had time to explain how simply this could be accomplished ALEXANDER WALL MILWAUKEE WIS

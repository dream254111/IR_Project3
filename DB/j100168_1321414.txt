THEY PROVED USEFUL OR DETRIMENTAL TO ITS GROWTH1 I T HE literature of legal fictions2 has one curious peculiarity Vhile upon other legal subjects the opinions are in general as various as the individual writers and are at least in seeming put forward not with conviction upon this topic it would appear there are but two opinions diametrically opposed and each sup ported with the greatest warmth These two opinions are appar ently that fictions are an unmitigated evil a scandal and disgrace and that they are one of the chief glories of the common law I This essay received the prize offered by the Harvard Law School Association to the graduating class of I893 EDITORS 2 The subject of this paper possessing as it does an interest rather curious than practical it has seemed possible and desirable on that account to relieve the reader to some extenit from the usual tyranny of footnotes by collecting at once the general references  Adams on Eject c I Bentham ed Bowring Frag on Govt

little less intemperate than usual when he said Fictions are falsehoods and the judge who invents a fiction ought to be sent to jail Later he adds   Swearing says one of the characters in a French

every part of the system the principle of rottenness In the Examen Legum Angliae or The Laws of England examined by Scripture Antiquity and Reason 1 the author whose name does not appear upon the titlepage says  that all manner of pleadings and proceedings both in law and equity are stuffed with falsehood and lies There is no uncertainty about the views entertained by these two learned writers and there are a great many degrees separating the point of view from which they look and that of the writer of the following extract from an article in the  Monthly Law Maga zine 2 To us    it is always a matter of extreme delight and refreshment to turn to those exquisite fictions which both adorn and sitnplify our law mingling utility with sweetness and tending to the noblest end to which poetry can devote itself namely to benefit mankind and render themn happy It must be admitted that some of the fictions met with in daily practice up to withini very recent times were calculated to awaken astonishment in any mind unhackneyed by perfect familiarity To find that in order to sue in an English court upon a contract actu ally made at sea it was a necessary averment that the contract was made at the Royal Exchange and in an action to try the title to land to find set forth a wholly fictitious lease and entry the lessee being a fictitious personage and a subsequent ouster by a non existent ejectormight well seem to require strong affirmative justification The amusing writ of Quo minus by which the Court of Exchequer gained jurisdiction in certain cases which proceeded upon the allegation that the plaintiff was debtor to the 1 London I656 2 9 Monthly Law Mag 172THE FICTIONS OF THE LA W 251 Crown and unable to account through the defendants default the equally curious Latitat setting forth that the defendant had com mitted a trespass and was in the custody of the marshal of the Queens Bench by which that couirt obtained a certain jurisdiction the losing and finding in the action of trover the proceedings in conveyances by fine and common recovery these and many others might well appear open to more than mere criticism Viewing these fictions in this fragmentary and dislocated form taking them as they stand disconnected from their surroundings from the times and needs which gave them being there is at least a prima facie case it would seem for those who attack them But is such a detailed view allowable Taken separately these various false averments and denials collusive suits presumptionis and relations may appear not merely absurd but positively unjust and wrongful Looked at in their proper relations noting their cause and effect the people among whom and the conditions under which they flourished  the absurdity and injustice may perhaps disappear It will be the object of this article to gather up a few of these old bits of the bony framework of the law to assemble them in their proper relations one to another and for the occasion to attempt what may be called a restoration The law of today is the law of yesterday modified and expanded by the needs of the new day It is to this capacity for nmodifica tion this prompt effort to meet the constantly arising needs of society that Englishspeaking people owe much of their liberty and happiness A community whose legal system is slow to respond to the wants of those for whose government it is instituted must of necessity be cramped and retarded in its development It seems evident that this adaptability and ready response to the wants of the people is one of the greatest excellencies that any system of law can possess What are the means by which the law is modified and expanded that is what are the means by which the law is changed Roughly speaking the means of change are two I Acts of Legislative Power 2 Acts of Judicial Power ai Judicial Decisions 6 Judicial Fictions It will be observed that judicial fictions have been classed as a form of judicial power The classification is the conventional one252 HARVARD LAW REVIEW and though convenient enough it may be observed at the outset that it is tnot exact Judicial fictions are in truth but the hand maidens of the only true judicial power  that of decision For the present lhowever tlhey will be dealt with in the generally accepted fashion as the product of a power distinct from that of decision Under anly form of civilized government the commonl people are the real generators of law Their influence may be slow in assert ing itself the poputlar feeling may take long to crystallize into a definite want but the want once existing presses continually for recognition It may be stifled for a time but sooner or later the demand must be met and satisfied In the satisfaction of these popular needs legal fiction has been a favorite instrument While it cannot be said that it has always been the best possible means to attain the desired end it can with truth be said that it has usually been the best available mealls The apathy of those whose interests were not immediately affected the lack of any union among the people to enforce directly the satisfactioni of their desires the combination and active opposition of those whose interests miglht be unlfavorably affected by any change in the exist ing law together with the fact that those opposed to the will of the people frequently controlled the machinery of direct legisla tion these reasons excused and perhaps justified a resort to indirection The judges who were in many ways close to the people able to understand their wants and in a position to give voice and form to tlhem could and did do it Looking at the matter in a large way therefore it may be said that legal fictions obtain what vitality they have originally from the people for although not directly created by them they are in vented to meet an assumed want and the fact that they flourish is itself an evidence that the want did exist and is in some sort met Mr Best in his books upon Evidence and upon Presumptions defines a fiction as  a rule of law whiclh assumes as true and will not allow to be disproved something which is false but not im possible Other legal writers give definitions not substantially different While this definition may be a good one as a matter of theory as a practical matter it is too narrow to include various devices which are commonly regarded as fictions and which are as fictitious in their character and as truly fictions altlhough of a different kind as those which fall under the definition of Mr Best A definitionTHE FICTIONS OF THE LA W 253 which should be made wide enough to include these various other devices would upon the other hand be as much too wide practically as Mr Bests definition is too narrow for the line has been drawn at no natural point of cleavage but arbitrarily The definition here suggested must be taken with this in mind A legal fiction is a device for attaining a desired legal consequence or avoiding an undesired legal consequence Of these devices there are three principal sorts Ist The use of one or more of the existing laws in a way unfore seen and unintended at the outset 2d The assertion that certain facts do or do not exist contrary to the truth of the matter 3d Fictions of relation Of the first class an obvious example exists in the conveyance by lease and release The Statute of Uses 27 Hen VIII c IO whose object was the destruiction of uses enacted that henceforth a cestui qiie use should be seised of the same estate he had in the use Conveyancers soon took advantage of this enactmenet and proceeded to create equitable estates for a short term in a pro posed grantee which the statute as promptly transferred into an estate in possession Being thus theoretically in possession the cestui was enabled to take a common law release of the reversion of the grantor and the fee was thus transferred without the neces sity of actual entry as was required before the statute Another neat example under the first class is afforded by the Roman law In the Roman law the power of a father over his children was absolute he might kill them or sell them for slaves and such was its permanence that if a son after having been sold by his father was emancipated by his master he fell again into the power of his father which was suspended but not destroyed by the sale In the early times of the Republic there was no way in which a young man could become free but by the deatlh of his father who could not release him by any act he could do It was afterwards enacted by a law of the Twelve Tables that if a son was sold by his father three times and was three times emanci pated by his master he should become free A legal fiction sprang up The natural desire of a father to benefit his son existed and at first the law afforded no means to gratify it At last a law whose object was to check the authority of unnatural parenits is passed and it is immediately by collusive and fictitious sales254 HARVARD LAW REVIEW made the means of effectuating the desire though not within its purview at all1 The second class comprises a very large number of fictions which while possessing little importance as affecting the actual development of the law have from their bald falsity attained to a distinction beyonid their desert While their object was usually to effect some reform in procedure as in the action of ejectment to extend the jurisdiction of the courts to matters not theoretically cognizable as in the writ of Latitat or Quo minus or to provide a place in the old classification for a new right as in the fictitious promise in actions upon the common counts they were seized upon by those who did not understand their significance as afford ing a good point of attack Such fictions have usually the great demerit of contradicting tupon their face the common knowledge of mankind while the ends for which they are invented are not of such an important nature as to make it quite clear in every case that the end justifies the means Upon the other hand it may be said of these devices that saving the discredit which their apparent falsity brings upon the law they are usually harmless and effective instruments The fictitious promise mentioned above is worthy of a few special words It is one in a class to which may be assigned tnost of the fictions of relation As the law develops and the process of refine ment goes on new rights are conferred and new classifications become necessary There is no place in the old law for the new idea Perhaps the plain way to confer the new rights would have been to say that certain acts shouild be followed by certain conse quences enumerating the acts at length and the consequences also There were certain difficulties in such a method and the develop ment of the common law in other ways suggested and made easy the short cut which was actually taken Where upon the lhappen ing of an event a certain legal effect was desired the occurrence of another event from which the consequence wished for would follow was feigned For example to classify a thing as a contract indicates at once certain legal consequences Where upon certain transactions it is desirable that the parties should have to some extent rights and liabilities as upon a contract although there was no mutual intention to contract the end is reached promptly by saying that a contract is presumed and permitting the promise to 1 2 Quar L J 312THE FICTIONS OF THE LAW 255 be stated The law of agency is full of these bits of legal termi nology A curious instance of the application of this principle is to be found in a common statute The common law has defined the meaning of the word perfiiry and to anything coming within the definition certain legal consequences are attached When it became necessary to make those who falsely affirmed punishable instead of creating a new offence and defining its punishment it was found more sure and easy to refer it to the already existing class with its welldeveloped law and so it is generally eniacted that every person falsely making a solemn affirmation shall be deemed to have cornmitted perjury Fictions of relation the third class in the classification at tempted lhave made themselves a part of the law The discussion is not open as to their general utility or whether they have jus tified their being or outlived their usefulness The doctrine of relation has become a part of the legal instinct of every common lawyer It pervades every branch of the law and to destroy it would necessitate the recasting of the entire body Fictions of relation have been divided into four kinds  Ist Where the act of onie person is taken to be the act of another Example The act or possession of the servant equivalent to the act or possession of the master felonious act done by one person in the presence of others aiding and abetting him the act of all 2d Where an act done by or to one thing is taken by relation as done by or to another Example Possession of land transferred by livery of seisin or a mortgage of land created by delivery of the titledeeds 3d Relations of place Example Contract made at sea by a fiction of relation held to be at the Royal Exchange 4th Fictions as to time Example Feoffment with livery of seisin subsequent attorn ment relates back Title of the administrator relates back to the death of the intestate Ratification by a principal of a previous act of his agent makes it good by relation Perhaps the part that the fictitious principle has played in the development of the common law the invaluable assistance ren dered in overcoming its rigidity at certain periods in evading bad 1 Best Evidence 313256 HAARVARD LA W REVIEW laws amending defective ones and rendering it possible to make law when it was necessary cannot be better shown than by a slight sketch of some one branch and for this purpose of concrete illustration some of the different stages in the development of the law of real property have been selected II The original grant by the feudal lords to their retainers after the Conquiest seems to have been for life only and was unalienable without the consent of the lord From a very natural desire upon one side and probably from lack of objection upon the other these estates were soon changed into estates descendible to the linleal heirs male of the first donee From this first breach in the feudal system which came about by mutual consent as it were it is desired to note the sulccessive means by which further conces sions were gradually obtained for the tenant class until the long battle between the nobles upon the one hand and the judges formulating the wants of the people upon the other ended in that complete dominion which every owner of land today exercises as of course The descent of the land to the lineal heirs of the tenant having grown into a recognized right the first step taken by the courts was to extend it to collateral heirs by a presumption that all who could claim collaterally were of the blood of the first donee This assumption of certain facts for true without regard to the real truth of the matter had the effect of legislating the lords rever sionary interest practically out of existence The right of the heirs general of the tenant to the lands after his death having in this manner been acquired the right to alienate in the life of the vassal was next sought and while it was held to be impossible for a feudatory to alienate his feud a distinctionz was soon taken between alienating the tenure itself and alienating the lands By these  presumptions and  distinctions the tenant found himself in possession of the principal of those rights which are today inseparable from ownership of land  the right to transmit it to his heirs lineal and collateral and the right to a certain extent of alienating it in his lifetime The means adopted by the lords to combat the extension by the courts of the rights of the tenants was the invention of the estate afterwards known as a conditional fee This was a grantTHE FICTIONS OF THE LA W 257 not to A and his heirs generally but to A and some particular class of heirs as for example to A and his heirs by hiis wife X The judges pursuing their policy proceeded to construe these gifts in a very liberal manner they had recourse to an ingenious device taken from the nature of a condition It is a maxim of the com nmon law that when a condition is once performed it is entirely gone and the thing to which it is annexed becomes absolute UponI the construction of the grant as a grant upon condition they decided that as soon as issue was born answering the requirement of the grant the estate of the grantee was absolute The construction put by the judges upon these grants made by the lords as gifts upon condition directly contravened the purposes for which they were created and the barons soonI made a more successful attemipt to carry out their policy in a manner which shows clearly their powver over the machinery of direct legislation and the impossibility of attempting through that means to meet the wants of the growing society In I285 the celebrated Statute De Donzisl was passed which provided that upon such a gift the donee should  have no pouver to aliene the land so given but that it shall remain unto the issue of them to whom it was given after their deatlh or shall revert to the giver and his heirs if issue fail This destroyed all power of alienation of lands granted in such a way and cut down the fee to narrow limits The evils of such an enactment are obvious Redress through the parliament of barons was inmpossible It is common history that in every successive parliament from Edward I to Edwvard IV a period of nearly two hundred years bills were introduced to repeal the statute and in variably rejected The courts had recourse to various shifts at first to mitigate the evil effects of the statute and finally to neu tralize its objectionable features The application of the doctrines of warranty and collateral warranty were the first steps taken At common law the war ranty of any ancestor bound the heir to render equally valuLable lands to a grantee of the ancestor even without lands descendinig2 A statute3 nine years before the Statute De Donzis had changed 1 13 Ed I c 1 2 It should be observed that the socalled sales of those days were in most cases merely perpetual leases by the grantor and his heirs to the grantee and his heirs As the renit or services reserved came to the heir the inijustice of holding him bounid with out lanids descending from the warranting ancestor was therefore more apparent than real 8 4 Ed I c 6 I276 34258 HARVARD LAW REVIEW this by providing that where no tenure was created by a gift and consequently no services as incident could be reserved the war ranty did not bind the heir The judges took it that the Statute De Donis had not affected the law of warranty and held therefore that the heir in tail was bound by a warranty of the tenant in tail as far as he took other lands to answer This of course was only a slight relief for this lineal warranty was not effective unless the tenant in tail died seised of all estate in fee The statute men tioned above requiring the descent of assets to bind an heir had reference only to lineal warranties probably because no trouble had been experienced from the warraniting of collateral ancestors The judges therefore assumed that other warranties remained as before that is that the descent of assets was not essential to bind the heir therefore by getting a collateral ancestor whose heir the issue in tail would be to concur in the alienation of the entailed estate the Statute De Donzis was successfully evaded Whether such a rule be regarded as just or not as applied to the barring of estates in fee tail depends upon the point of view from which the matter is regarded2 From that of the barons or of the heir in tail it might be considered hard From every other point of view it seems everything that could be desired The effect of the application of this doctrine of collateral warranty upon the heir in those cases where the relationships rendered it possible was that he was placed in exactly the same position he was in before the statute and is in today The doctrine of collateral warranty is a fine example of the use by the judges of a practically obsolete bit of law for a purpose altogether different from its original one The doctrine itself would doubtless have been spe cifically included in the statute of 4 Edward I if it had been prac tically injurious enough to make it worth while Though grossly unjust it escaped for this reason to serve the judges later as an instrument for effecting a very useful and necessary end After the Statute of Qiia Emptores I290 which gave tenants in fee a general license to aliene the alienee to hold of the origiinal grantor and not of the tenant the only restraint left oni alienation by a tenant in fee was the necessity of the happening of the con dition precedent the birth of the heir In the time of Edward II the judges in a case 3 laid down a rule which removed this last 1 4 Ed 1 c 6 8 Y B i8 Ed II fol 577 2 See Russ v Alpaugh i18 Mass 372THE FICTIONS OF THE LAW 259 vestige of restraint They held that  when the ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate of freehold and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited to his heirs in fee or in tail in such case the heirs are words of limitation and not words of purchase This is the rule now known as the rule in Shelleys Case1 The introduction of uses about I370 by ecclesiastics with the object of avoiding the statutes of mortmain was turned to account by the courts in conferring indirectly the power of alien ation by will lost at the time of the Conquest The courts recog nized the distinction between the legal seisin and the beneficial use as they formerly had between the tenzure and the land A tenant in fee by a conveyance in his lifetime to such uses as he should appoint by his will was given this great additional power To return to the Statute De Donis and its effect upon conditional fees Its immediate effect was to make the land so given inalien able The application of the doctrines of warranty and collateral warranty where the relationships made it possible gave some sliglht relief and here matters rested for almost two centturies The barons in parliament absolutely refused to repeal the statute and but for the boldness of the judicial legislators operating by way of a fiction it is impossible to say how long the system of perpet ual entails created by the statute might have continued or what the final outcome might have been The fiction of the common recovery to which Taltarums Case gave the first judicial sanction and which was in effect a judicial repeal of the principal enactment of the Statute De Donis depends entirely upon a bold application of the doctrine of warranty A common recovery is a judgment obtained in a collusive suit brought against the tenant of the freehold in consequence of a default made by a person vouched to warranty in such suit The fiction consisted in this that the person vouched to warranty was a man of straw usually the crier of the court who suffered judgment to go against him The plaintiff recovered the lands of the defend ant who in turn had a judgment against the man of straw that he render him lands of equal value The demandant recovered an estate in fee simple which could be disposed of as might have been arranged  Such a piece of solemn juggling could not long have held its 1 See I Harg Law Tracts 500260 HARVARD LAW REVIEW ground had it not been supported by its substantial benefit to the community but as it was the progress of events tended only to make that certain which at first was questionable 1 The right to suffer a common recovery was soon considered as the inseparable incidenit of an estate tail and every attempt to restrain this rigTht was held void2 It was by the aid of this fiction that during four hundred years the commnon law succeeded in rendering abortive every attempt that the ingenuity and interest of landowners could suggest to erect a system of perpetual entails until at length the principle embodied in Taltarums Case was fixed by an Act of Parliamient It is more than probable that this long delay in providing for the want by direct legislation was due to the effectiveness of the sub stitute and this is perhaps one of the arguments that may fairly be urged against the use of such a fiction that by supplying the need in one way it removes the pressure which would it may be compel the satisfaction of that need in another and perhaps better way III This slight account of the rise and progress of the right to that absolute dominion over land which is possessed today by every owner slhows that the most important forward steps were achieved by the courts alone and at a time when the object could not have been attained at all had it been necessary to depend upon the leg islative departmenit The process by whiclh the courts legislated the lands into the hands of the people as we have seen had several stages After the right of lineal heirs to succeed their ancestor had been con ceded the first step taken was the presumption by which the inher itance was extended to collateral heirs then the distinction between the tenure itself and the land by which the law forbidding aliena tion without the consent of the lord was evaded following this the curious construction put upon the socalled conditional fees which practically nullified the first attempt of the lords to return to first principles while the doctrine of collateral warran2ty and the ficti tious common recovery neutralized the second attempt The appli cation of the distinction between the legal seisin and the use of land and the allowance of a devise of the latter conferred the last essen tial power needed to give complete control 1 Wms R PR 45 2 Mary Portingtons Case io Rep 36THE FICTIONS OF THE LA W 26I Of these means employed probably only the last in point of time the common recovery would be admitted upon all hands to be a fiction at all Many perhaps would consider a presumption which is an assumption of the truth of a certain matter without regard to the actual fact  as having every element that goes to make up a fiction of a certain kind The ordinary definitions would however exclude all the other steps in the process and yet the finely drawn distinctions the strained constructions and the arbitrary application of inapplicable rules of law when such an application would produce a desired result all this sort of thing seems to be based upon the same principle which underlies the more obvious fictions What is this principle  The definition of a legal fiction already put forward as  a device for attaining a desired legal con sequence or avoiding an undesired legal consequence besides the defect of vagueness peculiar to itself has another which it possesses in common with other definitions This other defect is its failure to note in any way the fact that fictions are not a genus of which the various kinds are species but that the fictions themselves are but a species of a much larger class of legal devices which have been rendered necessary by the unacknowledged character of the power of legislation exercised by the judges which as a necessary consequence entailed a resort to this principle of fiction1 The principle might be exemplified in reasons unconsciously or con sciously false or at the other extreme by the statement of facts knowingly false but the object in either case was the same to harmonize the new decision with the old law It may be said that decisions might and may be giveni without assigning reasons If this were ever done and the last judgment was in effect new law it would be simply the doing openly what 1 Upon this point Sir Henry Maine says in his book on Ancient Law p 3I The process by which this virtual legislation is effected is not so much insensible as un acknowledged With respect to that great portion of our legal system which is enshrined in cases and recorded in law reports we habitually employ a double lan guage    The judge assumes that no question is or can be raised which will call for the application of any principles but old ones    such as have long since been allowed    yet the moment the judgment has been rendered and reported we slide unconsciously or unavoidably into a new language    We now admit that the deci sion has modified the law the rules applicable    have been changed    We do not admit that our tribunals legislate we imply that they have never legislated and yet we maintain that the rules of the English common law with some assistance from the Court of Chancery and from Parliament are coextensive with the complicated interests of modern society262 HARVARD LAW REVIEW has always been done The practice of assigning reasons simply compels the taking of short steps or that the power exercised shall be conscious legislation for no line of argument could pass far out of the straight way without the consciousness of the reasoner To illustrate this suppose a decision to be made which is exactly warranted by the existing law This may be supported by reasons absolutely sound reasons which may be projected in definitely without varying a hairs breadth from the true line of the existing law But suppose the decision however slightly to change the existing law The chatnge may be conscious or un conscious but if there is a change no reasons could be by possi bility assigned for it which would not if pushed far show the deviation What seems to the writer to be the true definition of a legal fiction is this A legal fiction is a device which attempts to conceal the fact that a judicial decision is not in harmony with the existing law The only use and purpose upon the last analysis of any legal fiction is to nominally conceal this fact that the law has undergone a change at the hands of the judges Just where the line of definition should be drawn across this line of devices upon one side of which they should be called fictions is not important Had usage confined the meaning of the word to such of these devices as fall under class 2 in which certain facts are alleged or denied which if true would make the decision based upon them consistenit with the old law it would have been a logical division Having gone beyond this it is difficult to say just where the next stop should be made The application of the Statute of Uses in the conveyance by lease and release or the use made of the Roman law as to the sale of sons by their fathers although unex pected consequences were within the terms of the law The doctrine of Collateral Warranty as used after the Statute De Donis was also but the application of existing law and the latter it would seem is fictitious in the sense that the two former are Both may be described as lnegative fictions for the judges regularly in the exercise of their powers find no difficulty in going contra to the letter of a statute to give effect to its spirit or refusing altogether to apply an inapplicable rule and when they neglect to exercise this power in order to reach some desired result they in effect adopt what is in spirit illegal The power exercised in the case of some distinctions is a conscious furnishing of words to jtustify aTHE FICTIONS OF THE LA W 263 juldicial decree In the case of the distinction as to tenure while it nomninally left the tenancy subsisting it was practically evisce rated As between the original lords and tenants and the courts it was an evasion the avoidance of an obstacle by a figure of speech Considering legal fictions in this broad way the question which forms the subject of this paper is answered at the outset These things it is clear are as much a part of the law as the decisions of the courts or the enactments of the legislative body Without such things the course of legal progress would have been blocked at everv step The result of the matter may be summed up in few wvords Those whose duty it was to administer and expound the existing law having in theory no power to abrogate or alter it have when justice demanded it avoided an undesirable result or reached a desirable one in spite of or without assistance from the existing law and have given many reasons in the process to show that what they did was still in line tuntil presently the new depar ture received the ratification of general assent and became in its turn a rule They have gone farther still and by divers subtle inmaginings distinctions and constructions have moulded the law yet more openly When evidence failed a presumption supplied its place when a technical rule was found inapplicable to special cir cumstances it was held so when the end in view required it the technicality could be regarded as compulsive plaintiffs might by sufferance of the courts state palpable untruths and defendants might not deny them and from that fine line where a decision de parting but little from the established law is made and supported by reasons which aim to show that there is no departure at all through all the various gradations to the coarsest and most pal pable fiction the underlying principle and object is the same  to conceal at least nominally the fact that the new decision is not in accord with the existing law It cannot be doubted that those manifestations of the fictitious principle of a more refined and therefore less obvious character which generally accompany an act of judicial legislation have been of vital service to the law in two ways first by making less noticeable both to the world and to the judges themselves and therefore more easy the legislation that is being accomplished and secondly by serving as a brake upon this indirect lawmaking power for the reasons assigned must not tunder ordinary circum stances be too plainly bad It may be doubted whether the coarser264 HARVARD LAW REVIEW manifestations of the fictitious principle the common fictions have upon a balance of profit and loss shown a margin upon the right side It can reasonably be said that the mere inconveniences generally avoided by their use might wvell have been endured until the legislative branch in its dignified progress provided a remedy The law would thus have been spared some confusion and much niot really merited abuse But even if the use of fictions using that vord in its narrower sense has proved detrimental to the development of the law which does not appear we cannot forget that they are the product and a part of a principle which has been essential to that development If they are regarded as an abuse still we cannot fairly debit them with the evil they have done without regardinig the good which has flowed from that of which they are a necessary consequence for some excess must be re garded as a necessary consequence of any great power It is certain that every one of these coarse fictions had some object and the fact that it continued in use is proof that this object was at least partially attained It is undeniable that certain of them proved of enormous service Whether in any particular in stance the net result of gain was sufficienit to justify the introduc tioni into the law of another anomalous thing might be a question but to the writer at any rate it seems clear that the common law is much indebted to fictions considered as a whole for its rapid development and ability to follow closely the wants of men Apart from the objection upon moral grounds that fictions are falsehoods there have been but two other objections suggested which are entitled to consideration and unless these appear to the reader so conclusive as to quite overbear the various suggestions which have heretofore been put forward it would seem that the result should be a judgment for the fictions The objection most commonly urged against the use of legal fictions is that they usurp the legislative power Admitting that the charge is true one may well ask What of it Had the English people at various periods of their national life and indeed through all periods been obliged to depend entirely upon the form ally authorized source of legislation not England alone but the world at large would have been losers The second objection is well stated by Sir Henry Maine in his chapter upon Legal Fictions He says  1 Anc Law 27THE FICTIONS OF THE LA W 265 It is unworthy of us to effect an admittedly beneficial object by so rude a device as a legal fiction And lhe adds I cannot admit any anomaly to be innocent which makes the law either more difficult to understand or harder to arrange in harmonious order    Legal fictions are tlle greatest of obstacles to symmetrical classification The rule of law remains sticking in the system but it is a mere slhell Should it be classed in its true or in its apparent place   To the writer it appears that both of these objections are in a way to lose what force they originally possessed They are based upon the ordinary narrow view of the object and cause of fictions and apply only therefore to the coarse fiction of the common defi nition The cruder manifestations of the fictitious principle die first They have already almost ceased in competition with the legislature to make good their place The direct way is now the short way and these objections will therefore soon be directed to something which has ceased to exist The real objection it would seem should be to the power of judicial legislation itself The fictitious principle  which includes all manifestations  is inci dent to that Such an objection in the light of history would be of course absurd While the power of judicial legislation exists and is exercised though unacknowledged its exercise must be at least nominally concealed The last vestige of the fictitious principle will die out when the need to resort to it has ceased Wlhen in the fulness of time the law has achieved its full stature when every great prin ciple has been not merely dotted out but firmly outlined when what is apparently conflicting has been harmonized and what is left to do is but a process of arnplification and refining fictions and the fictitious principle itself will cease to be used because they will have ceased to be useful Oliver R Mitchell 35

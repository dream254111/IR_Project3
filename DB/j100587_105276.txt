FRUITS AND OTHER BODIES FOUND IN THE ISLAND OF SHEPEY BY JAMES PARSONS M D F R S TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF MACCLES FIELD PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY MY LORD SEPT 25 1757 BEING EVER DESIROUS TO PROMOTE THE BUSINESS OF THIS LEARNED SOCIETY I COULD NOT LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT PRESENTED OF LAY ING BEFORE YOU AN ACCOUNT AND DRAWINGS SEE TAB XV  XVI OF A MOST CURIOUS PARCEL OF FOSSIL FRUITS AND SOME OTHER BODIES SENT ME FROM SHEPEY ISLAND BY MY INGENIOUS FRIEND MR JACOB OF FAVER SHAM SURGEON AND FELLOW OF THE ANTIQUARY SO CIETY READ DEC 15 1757 I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT FOSSIL SEEDS OR FRUITS ARE RECORDED IN OUR TRANSACTIONS THO MANY OF OTHER KINDS HAVE PLACES IN THEM NOR INDEED THAT THE MEMOIRS OF OTHER ACADEMIES HAVE MADE MENTION OF ANY SUCH FRUITS AND THEREFORE AS THESE ARE CHIEFLY PYRITICAL AND CONSEQUENTLY LIABLE TO FALL TO PIECES I THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO MAKE DRAWINGS OF THEM WHILE IN A SOUND STATE IN ORDER FOR ENGRAVING IF THE SOCIETY SHALL THINK FIT LEFT THEIR BEING SO SUBJECT TO MOULDER AWAY MIGHT PUT IT OUT OF MY POWER TO PRESERVE THEIR FORMS HOW EVER I HAVE GREAT HOPES I SHALL BE ABLE TO PRESERVE THE GREATER PART OF THEM INTIRE TILL THEY ARE SHEWED TO THE SOCIETY IN397 IN DESCRIBING THESE BODIES WE SHALL BE OBLIGED TO MAKE THE BEST CONJECTURES WE CAN OF SOME OF THEM ONLY FOR SEVERAL ARE SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS TO EVERY NATU RALIST AND EASILY KNOWN BY COMPARING THEM TO SUCH RECENT FRUITS AS ARE FREQUENT ENOUGH AMONG US SOME OF THEM ARE ABSOLUTELY EXOTICS AND INDEED THEY ARE ALL RARE AND CURIOUS AND IN MY HUMBLE OPINION WELL WORTH THE NOTICE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY DOCTOR WOODWARDS CATALOGUE  WHICH IS SO AMPLE AND FULL OF ALL KINDS OF FOSSIL BODIES HAS ONLY A VERY FEW FRUITS AND THESE ARE ONLY SOME HAZLE NUTS FOUND IN DIFFERENT PLACES A FEW PINECONES AND LARYXES AND ONE FRUIT WHICH WAS TAKEN FOR AN UNRIPE NUTMEG IN THIS COLLECTION BEFORE US THEY ARE ALL VERY DIFFERENT AND SUCH AS HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN BEFORE IT WILL NOT BE AMISS IN THIS PLACE TO GIVE A SHORT DETAIL OF SUCH BODIES AS ARE CAPABLE OF EITHER BEING PETRIFIED THEMSELVES OR OF LEAVING THEIR IMPRESSIONS IN STONY MATTER BY BEING PETRIFIED IS MEANT BEING IM PREGNATED WITH STONY PYRITICAL OR ANY OTHER METAL LINE OR SPARRY MATTER FOR THERE ARE INUMERABLE SPECI MENS WHEREIN ALL THESE ARE APPARENT TESTACEOUS AND CRUSTACEOUS ANIMALS THE SHELLY MATTER OF THESE IS OF SO COMPACT AND DRY A NATURE THAT THEY WILL ENDURE FOR AGES AND IF IN A SOIL OR BED WHERE MOISTURE HAS ACCESS THEY WILL RECEIVE STONY MATTER INTO THEIR PORES AND BECOME PONDEROUS IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY IMBIBED IF IN A DRY  SINCE MY WRITING THIS DISCOURSE DR MASON INFORMS ME THAT THESE ARE FOUND NO OTHER THAN RECENT NUTS AND LARYXES PLACE398 PLACE THEY WILL REMAIN FAIR AND SHARP SUFFERING VERY LITTLE CHANGE BY ANY LENGTH OF TIME WHILST THE FLESH OF THESE BEING SUBJECT TO PUTRIFACTION IS SOON DESTROY ED AND YET ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAPPEN SOME OF THESE MAY BE REPLACED IN DUE FORM BY STONY PARTICLES I HAVE A GRYPHITES WITH THE FORM OF THE FISH IN ITS PLACE AS IS THE CASE IN SEVERAL OF THE OYSTER KINDS THIS MAY BE OCCASIONED BY THE SHELLS BEING CLOSE OR NEARLY SO AND STONY MATTER GRADUALLY INSINU ATING INTO THEIR CAVITY SO AS TO FILL UP THE WHOLE W O O D THE KINDS OF WOOD FOUND FOSSIL ARE VERY DIFFERENT SOME ARE OF A FIRMER TEXTURE THAN OTHERS AND THIS TOO IS ACCORDING TO THE PLACES WHEREIN THEY ARE DEPOSITED SOME I HAVE SEEN SO HIGHLY IMPREGNATED WITH A FINE STONY AND PYRITICAL MATTER AS TO BEAR A POLISH LIKE A PEBBLE SOME THO QUITE REDUCED TO STONE YET PRE SERVING THE FIBROUS APPEARANCE OF THE ORIGINAL STATE AND SOME WHICH IS FOUND IN BOGGY BOTTOMS BEING NOT AT ALL CHANGED EXCEPT IN COLOR THIS IS CALLED BOG OAK OR BOG DEAL WELL KNOWN TO COUNTRY PEOPLE IN MANY PLACES OF THESE THREE KINGDOMS WHO LIGHT THEMSELVES ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS WITH SLIPS OF THIS WOOD CUT ON PURPOSE INSTEAD OF CANDLES AS IT BURNS WITH A CLEAR AND DURABLE FLAME IT IS REMARKABLE THAT ALTHO OAK OR FIR SHALL LIE AGES IMMERSED IN WATER UNDER GROUND IT SHALL NOT PUTRIFY BUT ACQUIRE SUCH SULPHUREOUS PAR TICLES BY LYING IN STEEP IN THE BOGWATER AS TO QUA LIFY IT FOR THIS USE OTHER WOOD DEPOSITED IN MARLY GROUND IS FOUND INCRUSTED OVER TRUNK AND BRANCHES WITH A WHITE CRUST THE WOOD REMAINING INTIRE WITHIN AT399 AT OTHER TIMES WOOD THUS INCRUSTED SHALL BE ERODED BY THE MATTER WHICH COVERS IT HAVING SOMETHING ACRI MONIOUS IN ITS SUBSTANCE WE MAY ADD TO THESE CLUS TERS OF THE TWIGS OF SHRUBS AND SMALL WOOD WHICH WE FIND FLAKES OF INCRUSTED WITH SPARRY OR CALCARIOUS MATTER IN MANY PLACES PARTS OF WHICH ARE TOTALLY CHANGED INTO THAT MATTER WHILST OTHERS ARE ONLY IN VELOPED WITH IT BONES OF ANIMALS WE SEE BY EVERY DAYS EXPERIENCE THAT THE HUMAN SKELETON MOULDERS TO DUST IN A VERY FEW YEARS WHEN BURIED IN MOULD SO IT DOES EVEN IN VAULTS WHERE THE COFFINS ARE KEPT DRY IN THE FIRST CASE THE MOIS TURE AND SALTS OF THE EARTH DIVIDE AND DISSOLVE THE TEX TURE OF THE BONES IN THE LATTER THOSE OF THE AIR WHICH GRADUALLY INSINUATE THEMSELVES INTO THEM AND AT LENGTH DESTROY THEM HOW LONG A SKELETON WHOSE BONES ARE WELL DRIED AND PREPARED BEING TOTALLY DE PRIVED OF ITS MEDULLARY SUBSTANCE WILL LAST AS WE NOW ORDER THEM FOR ANATOMICAL PURPOSES WE CANNOT SAY BUT IT MAY BE REASONABLY CONJECTURED THAT THEY WILL UNDERGO THE FATE OF THE SOFTER KINDS OF WOOD SUCH AS BEECH WHICH GROWS ROTTEN IN NO GREAT NUMBER OF YEARS BECAUSE THEIR INTERNAL SUBSTANCE IS SPUNGY AND CELLULAR AND THEIR CRUST IS VERY THIN EXCEPT ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE BONES OF THE ARM AND THIGH I MEAN THE HUMERUS AND FAEMUR THE SAME DESTRUCTION WOULD HAPPEN IF BODIES WERE DEPOSITED IN A SANDY SOIL BE CAUSE WATER FINDS ITS WAY EITHER BY DRIPPING DOWNWARDS OR BY SPRINGS UNDERNEATH BUT HUMAN SKELETONS HAVE BEEN FOUND INTIRE WITHIN A ROCK WHERE NEITHER MOIS TURE400 TURE NOR AIR COULD GET AT THEM MR MINORS AN EMI NENT SURGEON AND ANATOMIST OF THE MIDDLESEXHOSPITAL WHEN HE WAS IN THE ARMY AT GIBRALTAR SAW AN INTIRE SKELETON STANDING UPRIGHT IN A DRY ROCK PART OF WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWN UP WITH GUNPOWDER IN CAR RYING ON SOME WORKS IN THE FORTIFICATIONS WHICH LEFT THE SKELETON QUITE EXPOSED INDEED THE BONES OF ELEPHANTS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN SHEPEYISLAND BUT MUCH DESTROYED SEVERAL OF WHICH I HAVE IN MY COL LECTION AN ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HAVE IN THE LAST VO LUME BUT ONE  OF OUR TRANSACTIONS THEIR SIZE AND SUBSTANCE BEING SO CONSIDERABLE AS TO RESIST FOR A LONG TIME THAT DECAY WHICH THOSE OF THE HUMAN COULD NOT WITHSTAND TO THESE WE MAY ADD THE HORNS OF LARGE ANIMALS AS THE ELK AND OTHERS WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND IN BOGS PRESERVED AS THE BOGOAK C MEN TIONED TEETH AND PALATES OF FISHES AND OTHER ANIMALS THESE ARE OF SO HARD AND FIRM A TEXTURE AS TO SUF FER NO GREAT CHANGE WHERESOEVER FOUND FOR WE SEE THAT NO EROSION APPEARS IN THEM THEIR ENAMEL AND ITS POLISH BEING INTIRELY PRESERVED YET SOMETIMES THEIR ROOTS WILL BE FOUND CHANGED ESPECIALLY IN THE YELLOW ONES HAVING NO ENAMEL TO GUARD THEM IN THEIR ROOTS PARTS OF VEGETABLES THE LEAVES OF PLANTS WHOSE FIBRES ARE FIRM AND DRY WILL ENDURE FOR A LONG TIME BUT THOSE OF A SUCCULENT NATURE NEVER CAN AS THEY PUTRIFY VERY SOON WE SEE THE LEAVES OF FERNS OF SEVERAL KINDS POLYPODIUM  VOL XLVIII TRICO401 TRICOMANES AND OTHER CAPILLARY PLANTS WITH NODULES OF STONE FORMED ABOUT THEM FLAGS REEDS RUSHES EQUISETUM AND MANY SUCH OF A FIRM TEXTURE ARE FOUND IN SLATE AND STONE AND EVEN THE IULI OF TREES ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN FOUND FOSSIL AS WELL AS THEIR LEAVES S E E D S AND F R U I T S ALL SEEDS AND THE STONES OF FRUITS HAVING A FIRM TEXTURE ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF BEING STRONGLY IMPREGNA TED WITH STONY AND PYRITICAL MATTER AND I MAKE NO DOUBT BUT THAT THE SMALLER SEEDS IF CAREFULLY LOOKED FOR MIGHT BE FOUND FOSSIL AS WELL AS THESE BEFORE YOU SUCH I MEAN AS HAVE A FIRMNESS IN THE COVER ING BUT BEING SMALL AND MIXT WITH THE DIRT SAND AND THE LIKE PROBABLY IS THE REASON OF THEIR BEING OVER LOOKED FRUITS OF VARIOUS KINDS ARE FOUND PETRIFIED BUT THIS IS ONLY IN THEIR GREEN STATE WHEN THEY ARE HARD ENOUGH TO ENDURE TILL THEY ARE IMPREGNATED WITH STONY OR MINERAL PARTICLES THE RUDIMENTS OF FRUITS WHEN ONCE WELL FORMED AND A LITTLE ADVAN CED ARE FIRM AND ACID AND THE MORE REMOTE THEY ARE FROM MATURITY THE MORE SECURE FROM PUTRIFACTION AND THEIR ACID JUICE IS NO SMALL HELP TO THEIR PRESER VATION FROM GROWING SOON ROTTEN BUT INDEED WHEN THE FRUIT ADVANCES IN GROWTH THE TEXTURE GROWS GRA DUALLY MORE LAX THE ACID JUICES ARE NOW BEGINNING TO BE REPLACED BY SACCHARINE OR OTHERS MORE SOFT THE FIBRES ARE DRIVEN FARTHER ASUNDER AND THEY NOW ARRIVE AT THEIR MOST RIPE STATE AND THE UTMOST MATURITY OF FRUITS IS THE NEXT STEP TO PUTRIFACTION HENCE THEY ARE DE STROYED BEFORE STONY OR OTHER PARTICLES CAN HAVE TIME ENOUGH TO IMPREGNATE THEM AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE CASE WITH THE FLESH OF ANIMALS OF EVERY KIND THE V O L 50 F F F HUSKS402 HUSKS AND HARD CALYCES OF FRUITS AS WELL AS THEIR STONES ARE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE OF PETRIFACTION IF THESE FRUITS WHICH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO LAY BE FORE YOU ARE ANTEDILUVIAN ONE WOULD BE APT TO IMAGINE THEY IN SOME MEASURE POINT OUT WITH DR WOOD WARD THE TIME OF YEAR IN WHICH THE DELUGE BEGAN WHICH HE THINKS WAS IN MAY AND YET THIS VERY OPINION IS LIABLE TO SOME OBJECTIONS BECAUSE ALTHO FRUITS CA PABLE OF BEING PETRIFIED FROM THEIR GREEN STATE MAY BE PRETTY WELL FORMED IN MAY HERE AS WELL AS IN THE SAME LATITUDE ELSEWHERE IN FAVOUR OF THIS OPINION YET THERE ARE THE STONES OF FRUITS FOUND FOSSIL SO PER FECT AS TO MAKE ONE IMAGINE THEY WERE VERY RIPE WHEN DEPOSITED IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY ARE DISCO VERED WHICH WOULD INDUCE ONE TO THINK THE DELUGE HAPPENED NEARER AUTUMN UNLESS WE COULD THINK THEM THE PRODUCTIONS OF MORE SOUTHERN LATITUDES WHERE PER HAPS THEIR FRUITS ARE BROUGHT TO PERFECTION BEFORE OURS ARE WELL FORMED WHAT FOLLOWS IS A CATALOGUE OF THESE FOSSIL FRUITS C BEFORE YOU AND I SHOULD BE GLAD IF ANY OF THE GENTLEMEN WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE OF EXAMINING THEM IN ORDER TO ASSIST IN OUR CONJECTURES ABOUT SUCH OF THEM AS APPEAR DOUBTFUL BUT FIRST BEG LEAVE TO INSERT THE FOLLOWING REMARK I CANNOT OMIT AN OBSERVATION OF DOCTOR MASON WOODWARDIAN PROFESSOR IN THIS PLACE WHICH IS WELL WORTH NOTICE AND INDEED WHICH I NEVER ATTENDED TO IT REGARDS THE IMPRESSIONS OF FISHES UPON SLATE NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS OF SLATE WHICH HAVE SUCH IM PRESSIONS UPON THEM IN SOME

SEEN BUT UPON THE GREY OR BLUE SLATE OR THEIR IMPRESSIONS AND THAT THE SCALES OR SKIN ARE TO BE FOUND ONLY UPON THE BLACK STONE OR SLATE WHICH MAKES HIM CONJECTURE THAT SOMETHING EROSIVE IN THE GREY SLATE DESTROYS EVERY PART BUT THE BONY SYSTEM BUT THAT THE BLACK BEING OF A MORE SOFT AND UNCTUOUS NA TURE PRESERVES THE SCALES AND OFTEN THE VERY SKIN THIS HOWEVER MUST BEREFERRED TO FURTHER OBSERVATION T A B XV FIG 1 3 THESE TWO BODIES SEEM TO BE FIGS PETRIFIED WHEN HARD AND GREEN BEING AS I HAVE JUST OBSERVED THEN CAPABLE OF RECEIVING THE PY RITICAL PARTICLES WITH WHICH THEY ARE MANI FESTLY IMPREGNATED ONE IS MORE PERFECT IN ITS FORM THAN THE OTHER AND THEY ARE NOW SHOOTING THEIR SALTS AND WILL SOON FALL TO PIECES FIG 2 APPEARS TO BE A MYROBALAN DISTINGUISHED FROM THE OTHER SPECIES OF THAT NAME BY ITS ROUND FIGURE AND IS CALLED THE BELLERIC MYROBALAN IT IS NEARLY DESTROYED BY THE PYRITICAL MATTER AND WILL NOT LONG REMAIN WHOLE FIG 4 SEEMS TO BE A SPECIES OF PHASEOLUS ONE

GOURD FIG 9 COFFEEBERRIES FIG 10 11 TWO SPECIES OF BEANS VERY APPARENT FIG 12 UNKNOWN THIS HOWEVER APPEARS TO BE A FRUIT WITH THE CALYX RUNNING UP AND EM BRACING IT IN ITS HARD GREEN STATE BEING SOMEWHAT COMPRESSED ON THE UPPER PART AS IT LAY CONFINED IN THE EARTH FIG 13 AN STAPHILODENDRI SPECIES THE LEARNED AND REVEREND DR HALES GAVE ME SOME YEARS AGO A HANDFUL OF THE RECENT FRUITS ONE OR TWO OF WHICH ARE SENT WITH THIS FOSSIL ONE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION HE HAD THEM FROM BEN GAL AND CALLED THEM IN THE INDIAN NAME NEERMELIS AND SAID THE NATIVES USED THEM TO FINE DOWN LIQUORS FIG 14 A COMPRESSED POD OF THE ARACHIDNA OR UNDERGROUNDPEA THE FULLGROWN PODS ARE MUCH LARGER BUT OF VARIOUS SIZES AS ARE OTHER KINDS THIS HOWEVER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN WHEN DEPOSITED WHERE IT WAS FOUND NOT SO FAR ADVANCED IT HAS THE RETICULATED SURFACE THE APEX ON ONE SIDE AND EVERY OTHER CHARACTER OF THAT FRUIT OR SEEDPOD BUT SOMEWHAT COMPRESSED FIG 15 IS EVIDENTLY AN ACORN WE HAVE OF THIS SPECIES HERE AND IN AMERICA ALSO FIG 16 AN EXOTIC FRUIT LIKE A SMALL MELON BUT UNCERTAIN IT IS SOMEWHAT DEFORMED BY COM PRESSION FIG 17 THIS I TOOK AT FIRST FOR A FRUIT BUT NOW I RATHER BELIEVE IT A FUNGOIDES OF A VERY PRETTY KIND FIG 18PHILOS TRANS VOL L TAB  P  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 B A 16 18 19 20 21 22 23 C  MD DELIN J MYNDE 405 FIG 18 AN ANGURIA I TAKE IT FOR A SEED OF A SPECIES OF

BUT DO NOT KNOW ITS NAME ITS APEX IS INCLINING TO ONE SIDE AND IT APPEARS TO HAVE HAD A STRONG PEDICLE FIG 22 AN LACHRYMA JOBI FIG 23 A CHERRYSTONE T A B XVI FIG 1 AN EUONYMI SPECIES IF THIS BE AN EUONY MUS IT IS NOT SO FAR ADVANCED AS TO FORM THE SEEDS AND IS THEREFORE TO BE CONSIDERED ONLY IN ITS PROGRESS FROM THE FLOWER TOWARDS SEEDING WHICH IS THE CASE IN SEVERAL OF THESE WHOSE CALYCES APPEAR STILL UPON THEM AND HINDER US FROM ABSOLUTELY DETERMINING WHAT THEY ARE FIG 2 A BERRY OF THE SAPINDUS OR SOAPTREE OF AMERICA BEING NOT AT ALL DEFORMED ONLY HAVING A LITTLE LUMP OF PYRITES UPON IT BUT THERE IS ANOTHER QUITE FREE FIG 3 HURAE GERMEN THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE YOUNG SANDBOX OR FRUIT OF THE HURA SO WELL KNOWN FOR ITS BEAUTIFUL FORM TO THE CURIOUS WHO COLLECT SPECIMENS OF NATURAL HISTORY AND SEEMS TO SHEW THE TIME OF THE DELUGE FIG 4 THIS I THINK IS CERTAINLY THE STONE OF AN EASTERN MANGO SUCH AS COMES OVER TO US PICKLED406 PICKLED AND THE STONE BEING OPENED ON ONE SIDE IS GENERALLY STUFFED WITH SPICES FIG 5 EUONYMI  SPECIES THIS IS A LARGE SPECIES OF EUONYMUS PERHAPS OF CLUSIUS FIG 6 THIS BODY SEEMS TO BE A MILLEPED OR WOOD LOUSE IT IS TURNED ROUND THE TWO EXTREMI TIES MEETING WHICH IS THE ATTITUDE ASSUMED BY THESE ANIMALS UPON BEING IN ANYWISE OBSTRUCTED IN THEIR PASSAGE OR HANDLED FIG 7 A SMALL LONG BEAN LIKE OUR HORSEBEAN BUT LONGER THAN ANY WE HAVE IN ENGLAND

MYROBALAN BUT BE LIEVE IT THE MYROBALAN FIG 12 AN PALMAE SPECIES IT SEEMS A SMALL PALMA COCO FIG 13 14 UNKNOWN AS WELL AS FIG 15 FIG 16 UNKNOWN THE REASON OF THE FOUR LAST BE ING NOT TO BE DISTINGUISHED IS THAT THEY SEEM TO BE THE BUDS OF THEIR SEVERAL SPECIES BEFORE THEY WERE PERFECTLY FORMED SO THAT WHILE SOME OF THE ANTEDILUVIAN PRODUCTIONS ARE MA TURE OTHERS APPEAR TO BE PREMATURE AND CONSEQUENTLY ONE WOULD BE INCLINED TO THINK THEM THE INHABITANTS OF PLACES OF DIFFERENT LATITUDES FIG 17 A SPECIES OF FOREIGN WALNUT INJURED AND COMPRESSED FIG 18 A PLUMBSTONE FIG 19 THE CLAW OF

THE FLAT KIND MUCH RESEMBLING THAT SPECIES WHICH RUM PHIUS CALLS ECHINUS SULCATUS PRIMUS FIG 23 ARISTA CUJUSDAM GRAMINIS THIS BODY HAS ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN EAR OF CORN OR SOME SPECIES OF GRASS OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY THIS HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR A SPINE OF AN ECHI NUS BUT AS WE ARE TO CONSIDER ITS NEAREST RESEMBLANCE TO WHATSOEVER BODY WE MUST CONCLUDE IT AS WE HAVE SAID I NEVER SAW ANY SPINE IN THE LEAST LIKE IT BUT AN EAR OF CORN RIPE AND DRY IS AS SUSCEPTIBLE OF BE ING PETRIFIED AS A CRUSTACEOUS ANIMAL IN EVERY RESPECT INDEED THE SPICULAE OF THE EAR EACH ARISING FROM THE GRAIN BEING VERY SLENDER ARE OF COURSE DESTROYED DURING THE PETRIFACTION BUT THE FORM OF THE EAR IS AC TUALLY PRESERVED AS MUCH AS THE NATURE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE THING WILL ALLOW FIG A A MANIFEST

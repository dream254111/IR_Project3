this Society welcomes to the study and the diffusion of geographical science its younger sister of Munich and congratulating her upon a beginning unusually prosperous and energetic begs to send the

results of scientific research if we are watching even now with interest the progress of the fear 3738 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR 1872 less little band who were with us here a few months since on the eve of the departure to grapple amidst the icebergs the prac ticability of the problem of a Northwest Passage it is but natural that we should be deeply interested in such particulars as have been afforded us this evening of the appliances motives and surroundings of the men who contemplated a western pass age to India four centuries ago The address to which we have listened this evening has been delivered by one whose name is not unfamiliar in scientific circles or amongst students and whose labors in his professional sphere have been appreciated by many who have listened to him tonight and who can now bear witness how gracefully he can unite the labors of the pastor with those of the scholar In following him through his inter esting details of the researches and the explorations of Martin Behaim we cannot but appreciate anew our debt of gratitude to the men who performed the thankless task of developing the appliances and conceiving and propaganding the explorations by which others were enabled to execute the voyages which finally culminated in the acquisition of a world and conferred imper ishable glory on their names The application of the astrolabe and the abandoning of the timehonored route of exploration along the African coast for steering a bold course westward in pursuit of Cathay and fabled lands as yet unexplored resulted in the addition of a continent in the greatness and progress of which the Old World while admitting a sister in the family of nations in the present is already looking for a rival in intelligence wealth and progress Whether to Toscanelli to Behaim or to Columbus we are indebted for this bold departure from the beaten path of exploration it has been instructive to hear their relative actions recalled where each is worthy of our gratitude and participated in a course producing so brilliant a result We appreciate the value of the discovery of the mariners compass more fully when we have recalled to us the faults which rendered the astrolabe of so little value when it did not please the stars to shine or the sea to be still and we sympathize with the men who rose superior to the temptations which their surroundings and vocations in life held out to them to devote their entire atten tion to their daily duties and what was then as now popularly considered the greatest achievementthe acquisition of moneyTRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR 1872 but who consecrated a portion of their time and earnings to studies and experiments tending to the increase of the area of the world as then known and the benefit of its inhabitants To these men their posterity in reaping the advantages of their labors is singularly indebted for its gratitude but most of all those who enjoy the privileges of a citizenship and a participation in the wonderful progress of a continent which without their united exertions might still have remained a terra incognita Of these Martin Behaim was a brilliant example on him the title merchant prince often since applied was justly bestowed for beyond the money circles in which he had won it it is recog nized and honored and in leaving the multiplicationtable and advancing to division  he erected a monument more endurihg than the one he had placed on the coast of Africa  destined to stand after his commercial ventures were forgotten and the attendant fruits of his industry in so exemplary a manner During his lifetime he merited to have been rewarded in a man ner in accordance with his studies as a geographer by having his name continued on the map in connection with the strait of which we have heard the discovery so justly attributed to him May we not hope that his mantle may yet fall upon and his spirit be transmigrated into some of our own numerous list of merchant princes and that in this Society they may find a medium of emulating the example of one a former president Mr Grinnell in extending its means and usefulness  In so doing they would materially aid the exertions of the limited number of gentlemen who yearly make up the difference between the Societys limited income from membership and its outlays which including addi tions to its collection are always largely in excess of its receipts In this theywould emulate the claims of Martin Behaim on pos terity as a merchantprince the fruits of whose labor extended beyond the space of life Mr Myers then moved that the thanks of the Society be presented to the Rev Mytton Maury for his grace ful scholarly and instructive paper the reading of which had been listened to with such marked attention by the members of the Society and that he be requested to furnish a copy for publication in our Journal 3940 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR 1872 Mr Robert Dodge seconded the

AS A TEXTBOOK FOR USE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHERE TOO MUCH ATTENTION IS USUALLY PAID TO THE THEME IN LITERATURE AND TOO LITTLE TO THE ART AS THIS BOOK PRESENTS IT THE PURPOSE OF THE BOOK IS TO RECOGNIZE LITERARY WORK AS AN ART TO DEFINE THE MORE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF THIS ART CONNECTEDLY AND TO EXEM PLIFY THEIR APPLICATION IN SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS TO THOSE SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE NOT EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ARTISTIC ELEMENT IN LITERATURE THIS WORK WILL PROVE OF NO LITTLE ASSISTANCE HENRY HOLT  CO WILL PUBLISH SHORTLY AN INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN LITERATURE BY HENRY S PANCOAST THE BOOK IS WRITTEN ON THE SAME PLAN AS HIS STIMULATING INTRODUCTION TO ENGLISH LITERATURE WHICH HAS BEEN SO WELL RECEIVED IN THE LATTER BOOK HE TREATED THE PRINCIPAL AUTHORS AT COMPARATIVE LENGTH AND

THESE GREAT MASTERPIECES OF HUMAN THOUGHT ARE OBVIOUS MR NIGHTINGALES BOOK MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO REAP THESE ADVANTAGES PHYSICAL EXPERIMENTS A MANUAL AND NOTEBOOK BY A P GAGE GINN  COMPANY PUBLISHERS I897 THIS VOLUME IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE PHYSICAL LABORATORY MANUAL AND NOTEBOOK BY THE SAME AUTHOR THE AIM AS STATED IN THE PREFACE IS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CLASSES IN WHICH THBSE PUPILS WHO DO NOT EXPECT TO PURSUE THEIR STUDIES FURTHER THAN THE HIGH SCHOOL GREATLY OUTNUMBER THOSE WHO ARE FITTING FOR COLLEGE IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS PURPOSE THE AUTHOR HAS CUT DOWN THE NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS GIVEN IN THE EARLIER WORK MENTIONED ABOVE FROM OVER TWO HUN DRED TO ABOUT NINETY AND HAS INCLUDED IN THIS LIST NEARLY ALL OF THE EXERCISES REQUIRED FOR ADMISSION TO HARVARD UNIVERSITY HISTORIC HOUSES AND SPOTS IN CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS AND NEARBY TOWNS BY J W FREESE GINN  COMPANY PUBLISHERS IN I44 PAGES IS HERE PRESENTED THE RESULT OF A DOZEN YEARS SEARCH FOR OLD HOUSES AND OTHER MONUMENTS OF LOCAL HISTORY IN THE AUTHORS NEIGHBORHOOD THOUGH THE REGION COVERED IS OF SMALL RADIUS YET ITS IMPORTANCE IN COLONIAL AND REVOLUTIONARY TIMES GIVES TO THIS BOOK A VALUE MORE THAN LOCAL FORTYSIX REPRODUCTIONS OF PHOTOGRAPHS SET FORTH WITH A CLEARNESS THAT NO WORDPICTURING CAN EQUAL GEMS OF COLONIAL ARCHITECTURE LIKE THE LOWELL AND THE CRAIGIE HOUSE AND SCENES OF PATRIOTISM LIKE THOSE COMMEMORATED BY THE STATUE OF THE MINUTE MEN AT CONCORD AND THE OLD BOWLDER AT LEXINGTON THE WAYSIDE INN THE WASHINGTON ELM FANEUIL HALL THE OLD SOUTH CHURCH THE OLD MANSE ARE SOME OF THE BEST KNOWN AMONG THE SUBJECTS OF THESE VIEWS THE PICTORIAL WORK IS OF HIGH ORDER AND ACCOMPANYING THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE BRIEF EXPLANA TIONS DESCRIPTIONS ARE ALSO GIVEN OF MANY HISTORIC SPOTS NOT SHOWN BY PIC TURES AND MANY COMMEMORATIVE TABLETS ARE REPRODUCED DURING THE HOLIDAYS THE COMMISSION ON ENGLISH REQUIREMENTS MET IN PHILADELPHIA TO COMPLETE THE WORK BEGUN IN NEW YORK CITY IN MAY THOUGH THE REPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE IS AWAITED WITH GREAT ANXIETY BY MANY TEACHERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THE COMMITTEE BOUND ITSELF TO SECRECY SO THAT NOTHING CAN BE GIVEN OUT FOR PUBLICATION FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD THE REASON FOR THIS IT SEEMS WAS THAT CERTAIN OF THE DELEGATES FELT THAT THEY WERE BOUND TO 140CURRENT EDUCA TIONAL LITERATURE REPORT TO THE ASSOCIATION THAT SENT THEM BEFORE ANY GENERAL PUBLIC ANNOUNCE MENT OF THE FINDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE COULD BE MADE IF THIS IDEA WERE LOGICALLY CARRIED OUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMMISSION EVER TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING THE VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTED MEET AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR THEIR MEETINGS PRACTICALLY COVERING THE WHOLE YEAR BEFORE ALL THE MEMBERS COULD REPORT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSOCIATIONS A YEAR WOULD PASS BY AND PART OF THE REPORT BECOME INVALID THE DELAY IS IN EVERY RESPECT UNFORTUNATE STARCHAMBER METHODS ARE OUT OF PLACE IN OUR COUNTRY AT THIS TIME EVERYTHING IS TO BE GAINED AND NOTHING LOST BY OPENNESS AND FRANKNESS IN ALL EDUCATIONAL DISCUSSIONS THE ONLY REASONABLE INFERENCES FROM THE COMMITTEES DESIRE FOR SECRECY ARE THAT THEY HAVE DONE SOMETHING OF WHICH THEY ARE ASHAMED OR HAVE DONE NOTHING OF WHICH THEY ARE ASHAMED CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE NUMBER AND ITS APPLICATION PSYCHOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED BY D E PHILLIPS THE PEDAGOGICAL SEMINARY OCTOBER I897 TEACHERS IN GENERAL AND TEACHERS OF ARITHMETIC IN PARTICULAR HAVE AT LEAST ONE TRAIT IN COMMON WITH THOSE WHOM THE NATURESTUDY PEOPLE CALL OUR LITTLE NEIGHBORS IN THE POULTRY CLOSE WHEN ONE FOWL RUNS TO A CERTAIN SPOT AND PECKS AT THE EARTH FORTHWITH THE WHOLE COLONY RUSHES TO THIS NEW KLON DIKE AND ALL BEGIN TO PECK AWAY VIGOROUSLY AFTER A LITTLE EVEN A HENS INTEL LIGENCE IS ACUTE ENOUGH TO SEE THAT THIS SPOT IS JUST AS BARREN AS IS THE REST OF THE ENCLOSURE AND SO ONE BY ONE THE HAREM DISPERSES AND ASSUMES A PERIPA TETIC AIR UNTIL ANOTHER FOWL CRY OF EUREKA IS RAISED THESE CRIES AND RUSHES AND FALSE ALARMS DO MUCH GOOD IN THE POULTRY YARD THEY GIVE ABUNDANT EXERCISE AND THEY MAKE IT CERTAIN THAT THE FIELD IS WELL EXPLORED OCCASIONALLY SOME PHILOSOPHIC FOWL MAY TAKE A PERCH AND SURVEY THE WHOLE FIELD AND DISCOVER SOME SPOT WHICH PROMISES A GENUINE FOOD SUPPLY THEN A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE IS MADE BUT SUCH CASES ARE RARE IN ARITHMETIC METHOD THE HUE AND CRY HAS OFTEN BEEN RAISED AND THE MAD RUSH HAS FOLLOWED AND THE EXCITEMENT HAS BEEN INTENSE UNTIL SOMEONE HAS ASKED IS THIS SPOT ANY LESS BARREN THAN THE REST OF THE FIELD AND THEN ONE BY ONE THE ASSEMBLED CROWD VANISHES AWAY SUCH WAS THE CASE WHEN GRUBE WAS DISCOVERED A MAN WHO HAD ONLY TWO ORIGINAL IDEAS IN HIS SYSTEM BOTH BAD SUCH IS THE CASE EVERY FEW YEARS IN GERMANY WHERE THE SOIL IS FAVORABLE TO THE SPROUTING OF PEDAGOGICAL SCHEMES ONE HAS BUT TO RUN THROUGH THE PAGES OF SOME WORK LIKE UNGERS DIE METHODIK DER PRAKTISCHEN ARITHMETIK IN HISTORISCHER ENTWICKELUNG TO APPRECIATE HOW PERIODIC IS THIS DISCOVERY OF THE PANACEA WE HAVE SIMILAR PERIODS IN AMERICA I4I

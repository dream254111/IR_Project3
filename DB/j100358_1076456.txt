J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076456,THE DISTRIBUTION OF HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATES IN IOWA,I244662,THE DISTRIBUTION OF HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATES IN IOWA H EDWIN MITCHELL STATE MANUALTRAINING NORMAL SCHOOL PITTSBURG KANSAS THE PROBLEM THE QUESTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION INTO OCCUPATIONS OF THE GRAD UATES OF IOWA HIGH SCHOOLS WAS SUGGESTED BY THE INVESTIGATION RECENTLY MADE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK BY MR SHALLIES PAR TICULARLY INVITING FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS THAT PART OF HIS REPORT WHICH SHOWED THESE HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATES WHO ENTERED THE TEACHING PROFESSION IN THAT STATE TO BE RELATIVELY INFERIOR IN SCHOLAR SHIP BASED ON THEIR HIGHSCHOOL RECORDS ANOTHER FEATURE OF THE QUESTION WHICH OFFERED SOME INDUCEMENT FOR THE UNDERTAKING WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING INFORMATION ON THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS TO THE COLLEGES A THIRD PHASE OF THE GENERAL QUESTION AND ONE WIDELY DISCUSSED PARTICULARLY BY BUSINESS MEN IS THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL TO THE BUSINESS WORLD THE COMPLAINT IS HEARD EVERYWHERE THAT PUPILS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH OUR SCHOOLS FAIL TO MAKE GOOD IN THE SIMPLE CLERICAL WORK OF THE OFFICE STORE OR OTHER COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT THIS STUDY SEEMED TO OFFER AT LEAST A PARTIAL ANSWER TO THIS CRITICISM BY FINDING OUT WHETHER THESE COMMERCIAL WORKERS ARE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE ASIDE FROM THESE SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE PROBLEM OF INTEREST TO THOSE IN SPECIAL FIELDS THERE WAS THE GENERAL QUESTION OF INTEREST TO ALL OF THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATE DO THE HIGH SCHOOLS OF IOWA TRAIN YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE WORK OF THE STATE OR DO THEY BY FAILING TO OFFER SUCH TRAINING COMPEL THEM TO GO ELSEWHERE WHERE COMPETITION IS LESS SHARP  METHOD OF INVESTIGATION IN FEBRUARY 1913 I SENT THE FOLLOWING LETTER AND BLANK FORM TO SUPERINTENDENTS IN IOWA TOWNS SUPPORTING ACCREDITED HIGH SCHOOLS BLANK IS SHOWN ON P 84 I GUY WHEELER SHALLIES THE DISTRIBUTION OF HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATES AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL SCHOOL REVIEW FEBRUARY I9I3 82DISTRIBUTION OF HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATES IN IOWA 83 MY DEAR SIR I AM MAKING A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATES AS TO WHAT KIND OF COLLEGE COURSE BUSINESS TRADE OR OTHER OCCUPATION THEY ENTER THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THIS STUDY IS BY THE GRADES OF THE GRADUATES OF SOME RECENT CLASS I HAVE SELECTED THE CLASS OF I908 WILL YOU COOPERATE WITH ME IN THIS BY FILLING OUT THE INCLOSED BLANK WITH THE NAMES OF THE GRAD UATES OF I9O8 THEIR GRADES IN THE STUDIES PURSUED AND THE KIND OF COLLEGE COURSE BUSINESS TRADE OR OTHER OCCUPATION ENTERED SINCE GRADUATION  IN STATES WHERE THIS STUDY HAS BEEN MADE INFORMATION OF SPECIAL INTEREST AND VALUE TO THE TEACHING PROFESSION HAS BEEN DISCLOSED THANKING YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR COOPERATION IN SECURING THIS INFORMA TION FOR THE TEACHING PROFESSION IN IOWA I AM VERY TRULY YOURS ACKLEY IOWA FEBRUARY 12 1913 FROM THE CIRCULAR SENT OUT I RECEIVED THE HIGHSCHOOL RECORDS OF 845 HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATES THESE GRADUATES REPRESENT 48 HIGH SCHOOLS IN AS MANY TOWNS OR CITIES THE CLASSES RANGE IN SIZE FROM 4 TO 83 THE SCHOOLS ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ARE THEREFORE QUITE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE AT LARGE METHODS OF COMPARING STUDENTS FIRST AN AVERAGE WAS FOUND FOR EACH OF THE 845 GRADUATES THESE 845 AVERAGES WERE THEN ARRANGED IN 48 GROUPS THUS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL WHOSE GRADUATES MAKE UP TABLE I 3 MADE AN AVERAGE GRADE OF 80 PER CENT 2 A GRADE OF 81 PER CENT 7 A GRADE OF 82 PER CENT ETC EACH GROUP MAKING UP THE 48 TABLES WAS AGAIN DIVIDED ON A BASIS OF SCHOLARSHIP INTO THREE EQUAL GROUPS OR TERTILES ACCORDINGLY COUNTING FROM THE TOP DOWNWARD

LIBERAL ARTS THUS OUR RESULTS INDICATE FOR THE TEACHING PROFESSION IN IOWA THE REVERSE OF WHAT WAS FOUND IN NEW YORK IOWA TEACHERS ENTER ING THE PROFESSION THROUGH THE HIGH SCHOOLS ARE OF THE BEST IN SCHOLARSHIP WHICH THE HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE TO OFFER THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS TO THE LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES IS SHOWN TO BE CLOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMERCIAL WORKERS OUR RESULTS SEEM TO JUSTIFY THE SCHOOLS IN REPLYING TO THE CRITICISM OF THE COMMERCIAL EMPLOYERS BY SUGGESTING THAT THEY OFFER INDUCEMENTS SUFFICIENT TO DRAW A BETTER CLASS OF STUDENTS INTO THE COMMERCIAL COURSES OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND THUS ATTRACT TO THEIR SERVICES THE BETTER OR AT LEAST AN AVERAGE QUALITY OF THE SCHOOLS PRODUCT WITH REGARD TO THE GENERAL QUESTION OF THE RELATION OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATE OUR RESULTS POINT TO INTER ESTING CONCLUSIONS WE HAVE SEEN THAT THOSE TAKING UP THE WORK OF AGRICULTURETHE BUSINESS OF FIRST IMPORTANCE TO IOWAARE THE LOWEST IN SCHOLASTIC STANDING OF ANY OCCUPATION GROUP THEN THERE ARE BUT 49 WHO ENGAGED IN THIS WORK THESE 49 COMING FROM 48 HIGH SCHOOLS LOCATED IN AS MANY COMMUNITIES THE FACTS SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WHY DID NOT MORE OF THE HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS OF SUPERIOR ABILITY TAKE UP AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS AFTER GRADUATION WHY DID NOT THE GREAT NUMBER OF BOYS WHO WOULD LOGICALLY HAVE GRADUATED FROM THESE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE CLASS OF 1908 AND WHO MUST HAVE BECOME FARMERS FINISH THE HIGHSCHOOL 89THE SCHOOL REVIEW 90 COURSE IN THE 48 COMMUNITIES THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 49 BOYS WHO BECAME FARMERS OR WHO ENGAGED IN FARM WORK TO WHAT EXTENT DID THESE HIGH SCHOOLS SUCCEED IN TRAINING FOR FARM WORK THE ONES WHO DID GRADUATE AND FINALLY WHY HAVE THE HIGH SCHOOLS BEEN SO SLOW TO OFFER THE SORT OF TRAINING WHICH WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED THEIR BETTER STUDENTS WHICH WOULD HAVE HELD THOSE WHO DROPPED OUT AND WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN SOME SPECIFIC TRAIN ING FOR THOSE GRADUATES WHO DID ENTER UPON THIS WORK WHICH IS OF FIRST IMPORTANCE TO THE PROSPERITY AND HAPPINESS OF THE STATE THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST THREE IS IMPLIED IN THE FOURTH AND LAST QUES TION THE HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE FAILED TO MAKE PROVISION FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN AGRICULTURE IN ANSWER TO THE FOURTH QUESTION WE MUST BLAME THE COLLEGES FOR FAILING TO RECOGNIZE VALUE IN SUBJECTS OTHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL ONES THE PEOPLE IN CONTROL FOR DEMAND ING THAT AT ALL HAZARDS THE ROAD TO COLLEGE BE KEPT OPEN AND THE TEACHERS FOR BEING SUCH ARDENT SUPPORTERS OF THE GOTOCOLLEGE IDEA THAT THEY LOST SIGHT OF GREATER THINGS ALL MUST BE BLAMED FOR CATERING TO THE BENEFIT OF THE FAVORED FEW WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROFIT BY THE WORK OF THE HIGH SCHOOL MEANWHILE IGNORING THE NEEDS OF THE MAJORITY AND INDIRECTLY THE GREATER NEEDS OF THE STATE HOWEVER THE SITUATION HAS ITS BRIGHTER SIDE SINCE 1908 IOWA HAS ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF NORMALTRAINING HIGH SCHOOLS DESIGNED TO TRAIN TEACHERS FOR THE RURAL SCHOOLS TRAINING IN AGRICULTURE AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE BEING A PART OF THE REQUIRED COURSE ALSO SINCE THIS STUDY WAS BEGUN THROUGH THE ACTIVITY OF THE IOWA STATE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION A LAW HAS BEEN PASSED WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE DOMESTIC SCIENCE AND MANUAL TRAINING SHALL AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF JULY 1915 BE REQUIRED IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THE STATE ALSO AFTER THE DATE AFORE SAID ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURE AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE SHALL BE INCLUDED AMONG THE SUBJECTS REQUIRED IN THE EXAMINATION FOR A TEACHERS CERTIFICATE OF THOSE APPLICANTS WHO ARE REQUIRED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT TO TEACH AGRICULTURE AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE THESE PROVISIONS BACKED BY STATE AID AND SUPERVISED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT THROUGH A FORCE OF FIVE INSPECTORS ASSISTED BYBETTER PAID AND BETTER QUALIFIED COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS SHOW CLEARLY THAT IOWA IS COMING TO A RECOGNITION OF HER REAL PROBLEMS IN EDUCATION

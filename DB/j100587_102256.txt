ACCORD ING TO THE DIVISION OF ROME AND THE GREEK WRITERS WERE AS ELEGANT AND EXTRAVAGANT IN THEIR COMMENDATIONS OF IT BUT THE USUAL TITLE IN THEIR ORDINARY DISCOURSES AND WRITINGS WHEN THEY HAD

PERSIAN FOR THEY LOOK UPON IT AS A CORRUPTION OF AND DEVIATION FROM THE RULES AND DOCTRINE OF MAHOMET THEIR GREAT FALSE PROPHET AND THEREFORE ABSOLUTELY FORBID IT AS RE PUGNANT TO AND DESTRUCTIVE OF THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE AND SALVATI ON AS THEY SPEAK AND ACCORDINGLY THEY CONDEMN WITH ALL IMA GINABLE FURY THE PROFESSORS OF IT WHO PRETEND TO FOLLOW ALI AS SECTARIES AND APOSTATES AND ENTERTAIN WORSE OPINIONS OF THEM THEN OF CHRISTIANS OR JEWS OR INSIDELS THE PERSIANS ARE NOT BEHIND HAND WITH THEM IN THEIR HATRED AND DISRESPECT DERIDING THEM AS GROSS AND STUPID AND LOOKING UPON THEM AS LITTLE LESS THEN BARBAROUS INTEREST AND ZEAL FOR THEIR SEVERAL TENENTS HEIGHTN ING THEIR DIFFERENCES SO MUCH THAT IN TIME OF WAR THEY DESTROY ONE ANOTHERS MOSCHS I REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DISCOURSE IN CONSTANTINOPLE AMONG THE TURKS CONCERNING AN IMPUDENT HOTHEADED PERSIAN WHO PUBLICKLY IN THE NEW MOSCH BUILT BY THE MOTHER OF THE PRESENT EMPEROUR ASSERTED THAT ALI WAS EQUAL TO MAHOMET BUT IT SEEMS HE VERY LUCKILY MADE HIS ESCAPE OUT OF THEIR HANDS AT WHICH THE PRIESTS AND THE MORE ZEALOUS TURKS WERE VERY MUCH SCANDALIZED THE GREEKS HAVE TWENTY SIX CHURCHES WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE F PAG 144 152

ARMENIANS HAVE NOT IF I REMEMBER ARIGHT ABOVE SEA VEN CHURCHES THEY BEING FEW IN NUMBER IN COMPARISON OF THE GREEKS THE JEWS MAY HAVE IN THE CITY AND PLACES ADJACENT BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY

AGAINST THE SEVERAL HEADLANDS JETTING OUT INTO THE CHANNEL WHICH ADMITS OF SEVERAL TURNINGS AND SO THE WATERS ARE FORCED BACK TO SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OR ELSE BECAUSE WHEN THE SOUTHWIND FRESHENS AND

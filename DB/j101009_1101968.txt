wrong resulting in the death of plaintiffs intestate according to the decision of the Alabama Su preme Court in Louisville  N R Company v Perkins 44 Southern Reporter 602 Protection of Plaintiff from Arrest as a Lunatic in a Proceeding Had by Him in CourtThe case of John Armstrong Chanler v Thomas T Sherman depending in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of the State of New York raises an exceedingly interesting question Mr Chanler was declared a lunatic in the State of New York and consigned to Bloomingdale He came to his home in Virginia and in 1901 the County Court of Albemarle County declared him to be perfectly sane and competent Mr Chan ler had litigation pending in the State of New York in which his personal presence was absolutely essential in order properly to pro tect his interests He prayed for an order in the Circuit Court pro hibiting all parties from interfering molesting detaining or incarcerating him against the courts or persons in the State of New York whilst he was present in the City of New York for the purpose of attending the trial of the issues in the District Court Mr Chanler has filed a very strong brief in the case citing abundant authority to show that he was in the right of his case in asking this prohibition Lack of space in the present number prevents us from going at length into this veryinteresting question but we hope at a subsequent date May 68NOTES OF CASES to be able to give the opinion of the Court of Appeals The District Judge having declined to issue the writ Mr Chanler has appealed and the matter is now pending in the Court of Appeals Jurisdiction of Offense Committed on Federal PropertyIn United States v Battle 154 Federal Reporter 540 Judge Speer of the United States Circuit Court Western District of Georgia Southern Division held that a crime committed on ground acquired by the United States and ceded to it by the state of Georgia for the purpose of a federal building was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Courts He held that the state has authority to cede the ground to the United States and where it does so the only power which can exercise jurisdiction over such territory to punish crimes committed thereon is the United States even though the state has restrained the right to exercise its process on the territory ceded Liability of Applicant for Receiver for a DeficiencyIn the recent unreported case of Atlantic Trust Co v Chaplin Receiver it was held by the supreme court of the United States in an opinion de livered by Mr Justice Harlan that a complainant who has in good faith prosecuted a suit upon a good cause of action and upon whose application the court has properly appointed a receiver and who obtains a decree fully establishing his rights is not personally re sponsible for a deficiency caused by a failure of the property which is the subject of the suit to bring enough to cover the allowances made by the court to the receiver They adopted the language and the reasoning of the supreme court of Oregon in Farmers Loan Co v Railroad Co 31 Oregon 237 and refused to follow the various rul ings to the contrary in the other states The Protection of a Fiduciary in Settlement of Estate by Order of CourtIn the case of Carters Administrator v Skillman etc de cided March 12th 1908 II Va Appeals 3 our Supreme Court has rendered a decision which whilst of first intention is of great im portance and must commend itself to the profession In this case an administrator settled his accounts ex parte which settlement was duly confirmed Subsequently after proper publication and posting and under the usual order of the county court the entire estate was paid over to the only known distributee without refunding bond Nine years afterwards a bill was filed setting up the fact that there were other distributees and the circuit court held that the adminis trator was not protected by the order of the court in making payment to the only known distributee and decreed against him On his appeal the Supreme Court held in an able opinion by Keith P that this order protected him against all parties A very interesting history of the legislation on this subject is given in the opinion and the conclusion is amply justified in the learned opinion of the court 19081 69

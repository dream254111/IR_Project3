Mediterranean to the Dead Sea by Cclptain C W Wilson RE clnd a party of Royal Engineers from the Ordnance Survey By Colonel SIR HENRY JAMES RE FRS THE instructions for levellint from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea having been received after the party had arrived at Jertlsalem it was thought best to level in the first place from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea during the cool months arld to complete the line to the Mediterranean at Jaffa when the party were on their way home But in describint the line levelled we may assume that it was made direct from JafEa to the Dead Sea The line selected was that which runs across the maritime plain direct from Jaffa to Lydda three miles beyond which on the road to Beth Horon the line turns to the right by Jirlzu Birfileeya and 13eit Sira alld from thnllce up the Wady Suleiman to El Jib where it again joins the old Roman road from Lydda by Beth Horon to Jerusalem But at about 1l mile on the north road from the Damascus Gate the line turlls to the eastward over Mount Scopus where it reached the altitude of 2724 feet the height of the top of the large cairn on it This was the highest point crossed betweell the lUediterrallean and the Dead Sea From lMount Scopus the line follows the high ground to the WIount of Olives and from thellce takes the roal don7n to Bethany and following the road by Iihan Hadhur to near Jericho the lille turns to the right within about a mile of the latter place and was carried from thence across the plain bordering the Dead Sea to a point opposite a small island in the sea itself see Plan Throughout the

Mediterranean but from an examination of the driftwood on the shore it was ascertained that at some time of the year probably after the winter freshets the water rises 2i feet higher which would make

early summer the levelof the sea falls at least 6 feet below the level at which it stood on the day the levelling was taken whieh would make the depression 1298 feet and we may conclude that the maximum depression at no time exeeeds lUl0 feet Lieut Symorlds BE in 1841 made the depression 1312 2 feet The soundings in the Iead Sea by Lieut Vignes of the Freneh Navy gaYe a maximum depth of 1 148

depth of 13020 feet or a depression of the boftom five times greater than that of the bottom of the Dead Sea The levelling was exeeuted by two independent observers and from a eomparison of the two

travelled over country of a similar description yet with hills gradually decreasing in height The courltry mras lightly timbered with eucalyptus cork and cotton trees a11 of small liameter Tle hills we passed over might I conceive be male passalle for carts with xery little labour Everyxvhere we passed throufrll grass the country presenting the appearance of a wheattield the grass being generally above the horses bellies and occasionally even above the heads of the riders Frorn the summit of the hghest hill we had a splendil view ot Camden IIarbour with its islands and headlands to our right and rear with Afount Winffl in the distance to our right and front The baobab described by Dr Martin is situated in flat country and indeed after leaving the hills in rear of our camp we travelled over tolerably leve1 country occasionally undulating M ith ironstone gravel having the appearance of beillg waterwashed in heavy floods The ground was in places very soft and must be boggy during the winter season I do not consider that we have had a winter or rather rainy seasoll this year About a mile on our course from the marked baolab we passed over several gullies with quartz scattered among the gravel After leaving this country we as cended some tolerably elevated ground from which we saxv SIount Lookover Port George IV anl Augustus AYater in our rear and Atount KinO to the southwest Mount Lyell lay to the southeast of us and was plainly seen Passing over the level country we saw several kanfflaroos The land was still lightly timbered with eucalyptlls what is ilere named tile corktree cotton tree boxtree and where the grounl was particularly soft cab bagepalms Shortly before our midday halt we commencecl crossing the Hampton Downs which at this particular spot was not so well grassed as the country we had previously passed over but it gradually iTnproved WYe encamped at noon amidst abundance of feed on the bank of a stream which I thought to be a branch or tributary of the Gairdner Rver AVe had previously passed over a larger stleam with somewhat bowy approaches and having on its banks where we crossed a small thicket of palms an euca lyptus with large broad leaves and other shrubs and trees more vividly green and throwing more shade than is gerleraly found in AVestern Australia These streams evidently took their rise in the McDonald range and ultimately joined the Gairdller They were shalloxv but during the rainy season these as well as many dry streambeds which we crossedX nlust colltain a large body of water rlhe stream upon which we camped was running to the southward AVe bivouacked under what is here called the currant hee about 9 or 10 feet highn greyish striated bark with twisted branches The leaf is brightgreenp snlooth on the upper surfaceto the So7lthu d of t11e Glenely gaver 205 5 inches long and 1 to 11 inch broad The fruit has a pleasant acid taste black when ripe It is of the size of a very small currant and like most Australian fruits has more stone than flesh It grows in slnall blllaches the fruit beilln in different stages of maturity greell red arid black The stone or seed is of a flat oval silape The branches appear to be adapted for boat knees being liaht and touth Close by there was another tree altotether unlike what I have seen elsewhere It was a tall routhbalked young tree rhe branches lo not spread but take an 1lpward direction and the leaves spring from the smaller branches in fours They 7ere pointed abollt 22 inches long and 4 inch broad in their widest part or the centre they are of a lightgreen colour The tree was about 10 inches diameter at the butt or thickest part There was also near us the everlasting eucalyptus with its smootEl white steln and branches The grass at this place was principally kangaroogracs More birds were seen on our mray than we have met with at the camp They were prillcipally pigeons of a brown colour but not bronzewinged Startel at 3 oclock by which time the sun was less powerful Our party now consisted of eight with four packhorsesS and we uade a traclS going in single file which will last for some time AVe steered an east course throllgh Hampton DomTns a well watered country creeks running in the direction of the Gairdner bein crossed every half or threequarters of an hour The land was undulating composed of ironstone sand and clay alternately and occasionallyespecially near some of the creeks of alluvial soil Whatever the soil might be there vvas no lack of grass Ill crossing some of the streams the ground was soft almost boggy and at the chosen fordingplace of a branch of the Gairdner Mr McRaes horse was so far bocrged as to oblige him to dis mount To the southward of us there was a prominent hill which the settlers have named Mount Batten and near it mTas the elevated termination of a piece of high tableand looking until we came closer to it like a letached hill They are conspicuous landmarks AVe halted for the niglt on the left bank of the Gairdner a small streanl at this season with bogty approaches where we crossed it The banks were fringed mith palms Our haltingplace was about 10 miles distant from the camp During the lay I saw more grass than I have seen in any part of A0Testern Australia most of it kangaroograss and some a reedlike grass of a coarse nature Some of the grassesS especially those on swampy land were sedgy The day was tolerably cool throughout April 11th Started at 20 minutes to 6 and steered an easterly course for about an hour and then E by s until 9 oclock when we again resumed our easterly route to obtain a pass through the hills All the country passed over was well grassed and the206 SHOLL s Expeditio7lfrom Camden Harbou soil not so stony as that travelled over yesterday On the banks and in the immediate neighbourhood of the streams there was rich alluvial soil About an hour after leaving our haltingplace crossed a stream larger than that near which we camped last night We went over some very soft botgy ground and had to pick our way carefully but these places could be seen and to a great extent avoided Not so with the  dry bogs as they are termed The ground is apparently firmclay with ironstone gravel but is completely undermined The horses plunged con tinually up to their knees and no amoullt of care or circumspection could prevent this The  dry bogs were in patches over sorne four or five miles of country in our course WYe skirted Alount Lyell a twopeaked hill the distance between either peak being being about 1 mile Halted on the banks of a stream at 10 oclocks BIount Lyell bearillo SSE and distant about 2 miles WYe passed through a perfect thicket of reedgrass growing high above our heads but generally the pasture consisted of kangaroograss very thick and very high The horses when camped in the high grass generally wandered to feed of less luxuriant growth Before this country becomes available to its full extent for stock the long grass will have to be burnt or cut down it will never be eaten down It may be trampled doun and allow room for the young grass to spring but in its present state the eed ha3 no attraction for horsestock at a11 events The whole of the lantl was lightly timbered with broadleavecl gumtrees cotton cork and box trees all of slight girth At 9 oclock we rode up a hill to look at the country Mount Lyell was to the south of east and not far of WYe had a good view all round embracing the valleys of the Glerlelg and Prince Regent rivers Our course was thlough AIr lMeRaes rull and the Hampton Downs the greater portion of which are inclllded in this run The Ilampton Downs are all they have been described well watered and good feed The stream upon which we were encamped was running through the Glenelg ALr Sowle staled our position to be lat 15 57 long 124 59 Left this place at 3 P3I and passed through a splendidlygrassed country rhe land improved very much there being less stone and more alluvial As we neared the Glenelg the trees irlereased in girth but they were still scattered There was no undergrcowth of scrub notlling but grass AVe had some difficulty in crossing the numerous satercourses some of them being very boggy If we could have seen our way the impedi ment would not have been heeded but the thick arld high sward of grass concealed everything AVe catuped for the night on a stream a few miles from the Glenelg ilpon a plain of ironstone gravel and quartz but with the usual abundance of feed Mte estimate the distance travelled to he 15 miles Both peaks oftQ the Southtoctrd of the Gleelg River 207 Mount Lyell were bare the reddishbrown rock alone being visible Grass appeared on the slopes and at the base scrne light tirilber During the day we saw some native plumtrees the fruit exactly resembles a small plum larger than a sloe I was told that the fruit was intensely bitter I could only secure one Ilum and content with the account given by others did not taste it April 12th Had a sleepless night the mosquitoes being on the qui rive until daylight We proceeded towards the Glenel steering about due south as indeed we had done from our haltings place at noon yesterday Crossed several streams flowing towards the Glenelg which were more difficult to pass than those farther north the grass being higher and thicker and the streambeds more soft Mr McRae however was a firstrate pioneer and after some trouble we arrived orl the banks of the Glenelg at a spot where it was divided ilatO two branches both united lower down leavinn a small island between the two This we followed for a about half a mile when we came to some rapids and at this spot the stream we struck was united to the main brancll The united streams were about 60 yards wide but in the rainy season the river must be of considerable sizeS as there was abundant evidence of the flow of a larte body of water The soil on the bank is alluvial in the bed of the river sandy and rocky Are crossed at the rapids without wetting our feet the water was not in fact above the horses knees and then proceeded south for about half a milen where I determined to form my permanent depot on the banks of a stream runnint into the Glenelg with abundance of feed plenty of firenood sufficient shade and in fact all that we require for the purpose Oalr small tent was placed facing the southour destined coursewhere at the distance of about a Tnile rise the AYheatley Hills We arrived at this spot at 10 AM The country is generally ravelly with occasional out croppings of rock and here and there patches of alluvial soil There was no difference either in the character or quantity of the grass while the trees alld shrubs were of the same description as those we had passel before except that at the Glenelg we again met with the baobab though not of so large a size as those near our camp On the banks of the river were pape3nbark brees lofty but of no great girth the thickest not being more than 1Q or 12 inches diameter rrhe foliage was similar in shape to that of the eucalypti and possessed the same aromatic flavour There were also some trees of lnoderate height more umbrageous than the generality of Australian trees They had a rough blackish bark the leaves were dark and large the trees bore a fruit not in shape 1lnlike a large whiteheart strawberry of a yellowwhite colollr The settlers called it the mulberrytree antl say the fruit when ripe is not unpleasant Yhat I tasted were acrid Between208 SHOLLs Expedition from Camdez Harbour our depotcamp and the Glenelg we started a kangaroo and on the banks of the river saw a flock of black cockatoos apparently similar to those farther soutll At our own depot the hawks which swarm to such an extent at Government Camp began to collect There were a few sandflies and mosquitoes but not swarming as they did at our bivouac the nitht before Cool day April 13th At a little before 7 AM Mr Cowle and myself accompanied by Afessrs McRae Hindhaughg Hick and the native Billy started on our first exploratory trip in the Ranges WVe followed up the gully on which we were encamped for about an hour and a half our course beillg easterly with a little southing The country was generally rough and occasionally bogUf7 Crossed the streambed more than once the fords being boulders of slippery rock over which the waters dashed At its source we finally lett the stream and vainly attempted to make south but the hills for the most part precipitous salldstone elevations barred our prorress Ve dismounted and walked up one of the hills leaving Billy in charge of the horses The hill was of sandstone with trap or basalt at the base From the surnmit the country looked very rutged especially in our coursesouththe hills being tumbled together without any regard to arrangement wllile tlle valleys were as rockstrewn as the hills On this hill was a solitary pine we had previously seen a few It was not large being from 12 to 15 inches diameter and of moderate height Descending we tried our best to round the hills but were bafRed by the fearful country Followino on every occa3ion esery valley which trended anywhere near our course we were continually driven back by insurmountable barriers of rock The valleys in fact were for the most part ravines or ended in ravines tile hills coming down on either side and allowing but a few feet of level country if it can be called level where masses of rock cxf every conceivable size shape and angle are strewn over the narrow path The poor horses were tumbliil jumping and slidint exTery minute their legs and feet bleeling from the sharp rocks After all this labour towards midday we found oulselves not more than 5 miles from depot with no prospect of getting farther south in this direction Before our noonhalt we tried to make the GlellelU by starting north and east but failing bivouacked ill a small grassflat surrounded by rocks with z streamlet flosTing throuOrh the centre We passel along several of these flatD durin our morrling journey They were generally well grassed and the soil was red loam but they were all of very limitel extent Grass as usual was abundant in the most stony portions and I only saw spinifex among the crevices of the otherwise bare blocks of sandstone Starting at a quarter to 2 PM we pursued a generally norh route sometimes a little to the east or west according to the course ofto tAze Southwclrd of the GneAg River the ravines A7Te were nosJ grtadually descending having durinO 209 the former part of the lay been going uphill sorrletimes imper ceptibly at others 30 and 40 feet in the course of a hundred yaIds ARre passed through masses of saladstone assurnillg fantastic shapes and forms requirint bllt little eSort of the imagination to give them  a local habitation and a naTne One plot of rockscattered grounl bore a marked reselllllance to a ruined churchyard 1he broken headstone the dilapidated monument the shivered pillar and fragments of sepulchral architecture all were there shxle some of the blocks were sharp in outline and perfect as if they had just left the stonecutters yard At halfpast 2 althouh we hal since our noontide halt been travellint dounwards me wele still on very high ground with the River Glenelg some hundred feet below us tlle descent being a perpendicular wall of rocli on the opposite side were hills ot equll height and of eqllal steepness I4ere there were rapids The coursa of the river was nolth and south takint shortlv from the spot where we were stationed a turn to the eastward and afterwards a southeast direction As thele was no chance of descending to the river at this sot re followed a course a little to the castward of north and travellinC down a ravine the most steep the most ruggeci and tlle mott lengthy of any Te had hitherto traveled and which punished the horses very severely we emerged upon the level country south of the Glellelg and struck that river about a quarter of a mile above the rapids wilich we crossed yesterday and about two miles below the spot where its course was frorn south to north At these rapids its lirection was westerly From the rapids we proceeded to the depotcamp which we reached at 5 oclock My corllpanions stated that the country was more rugffled than any they had previously passed over and they had all more or less had sme experience of routh land one of them indeed had travelled throuh the elevated Gipps Land territory If our jourlley was fatiguint it was not otherwise unpleasant The day was fine and cool me had abunlance of water the scenery was not only novel but extremely picturesque anl often matnificent A good bathe in the depot creek soon restored energy and strentth and without beina damped by our nonsuccess uTe discussed the plobable plo ceeding3 of the ulorrow Seeino the impossibility ot perletlating the ranges in the direction we had pllrsued we resolved to take a southTesterly course as fclr as practicable Xpril 14th A fine nlorning but the flies as usual vely troublesome VVe went round the west end of Wheatly RanCe travelling through more rugged country than even vesterday but there was not so much of it We wandered about for sonle little time strivint to penetrate throuth the hills and struck the river pursuing a course a little to the northwarl of east The GlenelC VOL XX9VI P210 SHOLL

gentleman 0sho had been of siglaal service to us throughout the expedition The river where we struck it was 82l yards wide froln bank to bank but the actual stream of water diel not exceed 90 yards or at the filrthest 2o yards On a ledge of rock overllallging the river l7e bivouacked the horses looking at but 310t touching the spinifex A spring of water burst from tile rock and formed a small

limited in extent possess a soil of either sand or irollstone gravel sometimes of both The great peeuliarity here as well as in the land to the north of the Glenelg is the total absenee of under growth bushes between the widely separated thin and short trees there is nothin but grass and creepers Let it be thin or thick good or bad tall or short still it is grass The trees were gene rally of sulall girth the largest mTe have yet seen did not exceed 15 iIlehes diarneter and trees of this size were very rare The baobabtrees of course are exeeptions for they on the other hanal are of enormous cireumferenee but after leaving the tree named in my first days journal we did not see another until we came to the lenelg and then we met with a few There is one or two llear our depot eamp They are an unfailing sign of waternot necessarily surface water but of water at a short distanee from the surface They are mre plentiful near the governnnent camp than I have seen elsewhere Looking through the opening at the back of my tent I see two as I am now writillg of noble girth but not so large as others Between the eamp and the well and along the now dry bed of the watereourse whieh supplied us when we first landed and until lately there were severalj and this make3 nle the more eonfilent that there will be no great diffieulty in obtaining water at the driest season The palrlls are generally indicative of surfaee watel and grow in soft swaInpy land and upon the margins of rivers and streams In travelling along wilenever we saw palms ill our eourse we prepared to flounder through soft or boggfr ground and in nine cases out of tell the grollnd was either the one or the other The sandstones in the ranges have every variety of size form and eolour From blocks weithing hundreds of tons to pieces weighing a few grains in shape eolurnnar tabular pyralnidal in pavement blocks like gitantic walls with every line separating each block as level and as closely cut as if placed there by hurnan agency like ruined castles with towers and battlernents half defined and half defaced massive boullers and pebbles of the size of marbles lyin in every attitude presenting annles in every possible position they seemed like the remains of cities built by giants and scattered abroad in some great convulsion of nature The hues of the rock are varied to a degreedark brown ligllt brown yellowish browD yelow white red of different shades sometimes several colours in the same rock Ataill while many rocks are clothed with grass others are quite bare We have tllus anything

part of the North district a guana ilavint a hood whicll when the creature is in repose lies flat on its shoulders and back but when it rtloves is spread open and when it jumps from tree to tree appears to act like a Willg It is of moderate size the guana not the hood Since my return my son informs me that he has seen one of these animt1ls NVe saw very few guanas dllring ollr journey and I have not met with a snake in all my raTnbles on foot and on horseback  but two have been seen by ur party dllring this journey a small and a large oneand three were killed at tlle Government Camp in

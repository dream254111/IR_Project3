KINSON to Mr R PATTERSON Reld o N Tuefday evening the i7th of Auguff X5 1790 I789 the dwelling houfe of Mr Thomas Leiper at his Mills near Chefter was ftruck by lightning As this is a remarkable cafe the houfe being furnifhed with two good conduaters Mr Leiper requefted uIs to view the fituation of the building and the effes of the lightning which we did three days after the accident The houfe flands at the foot of a pretty fteep afcent on the Weft fide of Crum creek and within a few yards of the mill dam It is a regular fione building 36 feet by 32 two flories high at the Weft end above ground and threeEFrFECTS of LIGHTNING 123 three flories at the Eaft end At each end there are two flacks of chimnies which rife from the roof about half way between the eaves and the ridge The pointed con duators one at each end are faftened to the two moft Southerly chimnies and are brought direatly down the outfide of the wall to the ground which they enter pro bably but a few feet on account of the rock The rods are well made the pieces being fcrewed together and not conneated by hooks The cloud which difcharged the lightning came from the Wefi and the fluid appears to have proceeded down the Weftern conduaor at leafi in part for the poinit is melted down to a confiderable thicknefs The next per ceptible effeat of it is on the South fide of the fame chim ney where it has torn up the fhingles of the roof nearly i8 inches in breadth from the chimney direaly down to a water gutter covered with copper which runs along the roof from Weft to Eaft a foot above the eaves and at the Eafi end is conneated with a copper fpout which comes direCtly down along the wall within four feet of the eartlh where it difcharges the rain water into a cedar tub bound with iron hoops The lightning appears to have paffed quietly along tlle copper the whole length of the gutter and fpout About a hands breadth below the end of the fpout it tore off and Ihivered in pieces an inch board which paffed downi be tween the fpout and the wall and had been lower down than the fpout partly paffing into the tub it made its way through to the outfide and thence into the earth throw ing off many fmall fplinters from different fides of the tub Another part of the lightning appears to have proceed ed along the Weftern rod until it came direCtly oppofite to thle copper gutter from which it is diftant 6 or 7 feet it then ran along the cornifh part of which it threw off in Q2 its124 EFFECTS off LIGHTNING its courfe to the end of the gutter where it united with that part firft mentioned That fome part was difcharged into the earth by this conduaor is evident for the furface of the earth was thrown up at the foot of it Immediately Weffward from the houfe the garden rifes pretty fleep fo that at the diflance of lefs than 20 rods thie furface of the ground is higher than the chimney tops and immediately adjoining is a grove of oaks and other trees of the ufual height It may feem extraordinary that the elelcric fluid was not difcharged through fome of thofe trees which are fo much higher than the houfe and over the tops of which the cloud muft have paffed before it reached the houfe But perhaps on account of the vicinity of the water the houfe with its conduaors including the copper fpout afforded a more ready conveyance The hill Weft of the houfe is one continued rock covered with a few feet or rather inches of earth The rock is probably but a bad conduCtor and the earth on its furface pretty dry for it had not yet rain ed at that time Had the earth been fufficiently moift at the foot of the condu6tor it is likely we fhould not have feen any effeaCs of the lightning This cafe feems to give fome force to an objeCtion made long ago to the ufe of pointed rods That is that they may fometimes invite a difcharge of the eleCric matter which would otherwite have paffed elfewhere and which they are neverthelefs infufficient to convey without injury to the building But it is by no means certain that the houfe would have efcaped had it not been furnifhed with rods for we very often fee the lightning firike low trees and buildings in the nieighbourhood of others much high er and befides had not the copper gutter and fpout fur nifhed fuch an excellent conduCtor the fluid might have paffed quietly through one or both of the rods But by whatever means the difcharge was promoted in that par ticular manner the damage done to the building was trif lingEXPERIMENTS ON EVAPORATION I25 ling and no part of the infide fuffered in the leaff not withftanding that the firoke by the prodigious noife which accompanied it feemed to be very powerful It is remarkable that a perfon was fitting at the time in a door on the ground floor not more than 4 feet from the lower end of the copper fpout who received no injury though he very fenfibly felt the fhock From our obfervations on the above cafe as well as fome others that have occurred we would flrongly recommend to thofe who put up pointed rods that the lower end be funk fufficiently deep to reach moift earth in the dryeft fea fons And we fubmit it to thofe converfant with eleatrical philofophy whether when there are more rods than one to a building it might not conduce much to its fafety to form a good communication between the rods and like wife between themn and a copper water fpout carrying an iron or copper rod from the lower end of the fpout a fufficient depth into the ground Thinking it poffible that the above may afford fome hints for improving the means now pretty generally ia ufe for guarding againft the fatal effeas of thunder ftorms we have thought proper to lay it before the Society and fhall be happy if it receives their approbation

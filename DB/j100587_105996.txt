J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,105996,REMARKS ON THE AURORA BOREALIS BY MR WINN IN A LETTER TO DR FRANKLIN,I206929,128 XVII REMARKS ON THE AURORA BOREALIS BY MR WINN IN A LETTER TO DR FRANKLIN SPITHEAD AUGUST 12 1772 S I R I HAVE OFTEN WISHED THAT SOMEBODY WOULD CAREFULLY COLLATE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF METEOROLOGICAL JOURNALS WITH INTENT TO OBSERVE AND CLASS THE SEVERAL APPEARANCES IN THE ATMOSPHERE BEFORE GREAT CHANGES IN THE WEATHER PARTICULARLY BEFORE GREAT STORMS I AM PERSUADED FROM MY OWN OBSERVATION THAT IN GENERAL SUFFI CIENT INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING TEMPESTS PRECEED THEM A CONSIDERABLE TIME DID WE BUT CAREFULLY NOTE THEM THE PHAENOMENON WHICH I AM GOING TO MENTION IS ONE OF THOSE INDICATIONS WHICH NOT ONLY PORTEND AN APPROACHING TEMPEST BUT ASCERTAIN FROM WHAT QUARTER IT WILL COME A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MAY RENDER IT OF ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO SEAMEN I BELIEVE THE OBSERVATION IS NEW THAT THE AURORA BOREALIS IS CONSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY HARD SOUTHERLY OR SOUTHWEST WINDS ATTENDED WITH HAZY WEATHER AND SMALL RAIN I THINK I AM WARRANTED FROM EXPERIENCE TO SAY CONSTANTLY FOR IN TWENTYTHREE INSTANCES THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE I FIRST MADE THE OBSER REDDE JAN 20 1774129 OBSERVATION IT HAS INVARIABLY OBTAINED HOWEVER I BEG LEAVE TO REQUEST YOU WILL RECOMMEND IT TO THE NOTICE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AS A MATTER WHICH WHEN CONFIRMED BY FURTHER OBSERVATIONS AND GE NERALLY KNOWN MAY BE OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN AT FIRST APPEARS TO SHEW THAT IT MAY GIVE ME LEAVE TO RECITE THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH FIRST OCCA SIONED MY TAKING NOTICE OF IT SAILING DOWN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IN 1769 A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE AUTUMNAL EQUINOX WE HAD A REMARKABLY BRIGHT AND VIVID AURORA THE WHOLE NIGHT IN SHORE THE WIND WAS FLUCTUATING BETWEEN N N W AND N W AND FARTHER OUT W N W DESIROUS OF BENEFITING BY THE LAND WIND AND ALSO OF TAKING ADVAN TAGE OF AN EARLIER EBBTIDE I DISPENSED WITH THE GOOD OLD MARINE ADAGE NEVER TO APPROACH TOO NEAR A WEATHERSHORE LEST IT SHOULD PROVE A LEE SHORE AND BY SHORT TACKS CLUNG CLOSE ALONG THE ENGLISH COAST NEXT DAY THE WIND VEERED TO THE S W AND SOON AFTER TO S S W AND SOMETIMES S WE WERE THEN IN THAT DANGEROUS BAY BETWEEN PORTLAND AND THE START POINT AND CARRIED A PRESSING SAIL WITH HOPES OF REACHING TORBAY BEFORE DARK BUT NIGHT FELL UPON US WITH THICK HAZE AND SMALL RAIN IN SO MUCH THAT WE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THE LAND AT THE DISTANCE OF A SHIPS LENGTH THE GALE WAS NOW INCREASED TO A STORM IN THIS DILEMMA NOTHING REMAINED BUT TO ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP OFF THE SHORE TILL THE WIND SHOULD CHANGE LUCKILY OUR SHIP WAS A STOUT ONE AND WELL RIGGED REFLECTING SOME TIME AFTER ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS STORM AND THE PHAENOMENA THAT PRECEDED IT I DETERMINED TO HAVE PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO VOL LXIV S FUTURE130 FUTURE AURORAE AND THE WEATHER THAT SHOULD SUCCEED THEM AND AS I HAVE OBSERVED ABOVE IN TWENTY THREE INSTANCES HAVE FOUND THEM UNIFORM EXCEPT IN DEGREE THE GALE GENERALLY COMMENCING BE TWEEN TWENTYFOUR AND THIRTY HOURS AFTER THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE AURORA MORE TIME AND OB SERVATION WILL PROBABLY DISCOVER WHETHER THE STRENGTH OF THE SUCCEEDING GALE IS PROPORTIONATE TO THE SPLENDOR AND VIVACITY OF THE AURORA AND THE DISTANCE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM I ONLY SUSPECT THAT THE MORE BRILLIANT AND ACTIVE THE FIRST IS THE SOONER WILL THE LATER OCCUR BE MORE VIOLENT BUT OF SHORTER DURATION THAN WHEN THE LIGHT IS LAN GUID AND DULL PERHAPS TOO THE COLOUR OF THE AURORA MAY BE SOME GUIDE IN FORMING A JUDGEMENT OF THE COMING GALE THAT WHICH PRECEEDED THE STORM I HAVE MENTIONED WAS EXCEEDINGLY SPLENDID THE TEMPEST SUCCEEDED IT IN LESS THAN TWENTYFOUR HOURS WAS VIOLENT BUT OF SHORT ABOUT EIGHT HOURS CONTINUANCE IN JUNE LAST A LITTLE WITHOUT SOUND INGS WE HAD FOR TWO NIGHTS FOLLOWING FAINT IN ACTIVE AURORAE THE CONSEQUENT GALE WAS NOT HARD BUT LASTED NEAR THREE DAYS THE FIRST DAY ATTENDED WITH HAZE AND SMALL RAIN THE SECOND WITH HAZE ONLY AND THE LAST DAY CLEAR THE BENEFIT WHICH THIS OBSERVATION ON THE AU RORA BOREALIS WHEN FURTHER CONFIRMED AND KNOWN MAY BE OF TO SEAMEN IS OBVIOUS IN NAVIGATING NEAR COASTS WHICH TEND EAST AND WEST PARTICULARLY IN THE BRITISH CHANNEL THEY MAY WHEN WARNED BY THE AURORA BOREALIS GET INTO PORT AND EVADE THE IMPENDING STORM OR BY STRETCHING OVER TO THE SOUTHWARD FACILITATE THEIR PASSAGE BY THAT VERY STORM131 STORM WHICH MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED THEM FOR NO WINDS ARE SO DANGEROUS IN THE CHANNEL AS SOUTHERLY AND SOUTHWEST IN A WORD SINCE I HAVE MADE THIS OBSERVATION I HAVE GOT OUT OF THE CHANNEL WHEN OTHER MEN AS ALERT AND IN FASTER SAILING SHIPS BUT UNAPPRIZED OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN DRIVEN BACK BUT WITH DIFFI CULTY HAVE ESCAPED SHIPWRECK PERHAPS THE OBSERVATION THAT SOUTHERLY GALES CONSTANTLY SUCCEED THESE PHAENOMENA MAY HELP TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NATURE OF THE AURORA BOREALIS MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THAT SUBJECT I SHALL SOME TIME BEG LEAVE TO LAY BEFORE YOU I AM WITH GREAT RESPECT S I R YOUR OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT J S W I N N S 2 A FURTHER132 A FURTHER NOTE FROM THE SAME GENTLEMAN IN AUGUST LAST MR WINN SENT DR FRANKLIN SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE AURORA BOREALIS TO WHICH HE WOULD ADD THAT ON SATURDAY EVENING THE 16TH INSTANT AS MR WINN CAME TO TOWN THE AURORA WAS SO BRIGHT THAT HE FOUND A CROUD OF PEOPLE IN THE MINORIES GAZING AT IT WHICH THEY TOOK TO BE THE EFFECT OF A GREAT FIRE ABOUT BISHOPSGATESTREET THE NEXT DAY WE HAD A HARD GALE AT S S W WITH RAIN FRIDAY MORN 22 JAN CONJECTURE ON THE FOREGOING THE AURORAE BOREALES THOUGH VISIBLE ALMOST EVERY NIGHT OF CLEAR WEATHER IN THE MORE NORTHERN REGIONS AND VERY HIGH IN THE ATMOSPHERE CAN SCARCE BE VISIBLE IN ENGLAND BUT WHEN THE ATMO SPHERE IS PRETTY CLEAR OF CLOUDS FOR THE WHOLE SPACE BETWEEN US AND THOSE REGIONS AND THEREFORE ARE SELDOM VISIBLE HERE THIS EXTENSIVE CLEARNESS MAY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY A LONG CONTINUANCE OF NORTHERLY WINDS WHEN THE WINDS HAVE LONG CONTINUED IN ONE QUARTER THE RETURN IS OFTEN VIO LENT ALLOWING THE FACT SO REPEATEDLY OBSERVED BY MR WINN PERHAPS THIS MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE VIOLENCE OF THE SOUTHERLY WINDS THAT SOON FOLLOW THE APPEARANCE OF THE AURORA ON OUR COASTS B F XVIII EX

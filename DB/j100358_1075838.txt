J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075838,THE AFFILIATED SCHOOL IN THEORY AND PRACTICE ITS INFLUENCE ON EXAMINATIONS IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE,I244565,THE AFFILIATED SCHOOL IN THEORY AND PRACTICE ITS INFLUENCE ON EXAMINATIONS IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE1 IT IS BUT NATURAL THAT IN THIS COUNTRY WITH ITS INDEPENDENCE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS A LACK OF UNIFORMITY SHOULD BE OBSERVABLE AS FAR AS THE TRANSITION FROM THE SECONDARY SCHOOL TO THE HIGHER INSTITUTION IS CONCERNED ONLY IN LATE YEARS MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN INAUGURATED THAT AIM AT A CERTAIN UNIFICATION OF FORCES AND GREATER ECONOMY IN THE EXPENDITURE OF EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES OF THE TWO METHODS RELIED ON TO GIVE ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF A PUPILS FITNESS TO DO COLLEGIATE WORK I AM TO DISCUSS THE ONE WHICH WITH A FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS IS IN OPERATION IN THE MAJORITY OF UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES IN THE COUNTRY THE COMMITTEE THAT FORMULATED MY SUBJECT HAS MADE USE OF THE TERM AFFILIATED TO DESIGNATE AN ESPECIALLY INTIMATE CONNEC TION OF THE HIGHER INSTITUTION WITH CERTAIN SECONDARY SCHOOLS THE TERM DOES NOT DENOTE HERE AN ORGANIC OR SEMIORGANIC UNION OF THE LOWER WITH THE HIGHER SCHOOL IN WHICH SENSE IT IS USED SOMETIMES BUT IS CHOSEN TO DESIGNATE A SCHOOL WHICH BY SOME IS CALLED AN APPROVED BY OTHERS A COOPERATING OR ACCRED ITED OR DIPLOMA SCHOOL I MIGHT THEREFORE PUT THE FIRST PART OF MY SUBJECT INTO THE WORDS THE ACCREDITED SCHOOL IN THEORY AND PRACTICE BECAUSE OF THE LIMITS OF TIME IMPOSED I SHALL CONFINE MYSELF TO A BARE STATEMENT OF ESSENTIALS AND EVEN HERE I FEAR I SHALL IN EFFECT SAY ONLY THINGS WITH WHICH YOU ARE FAMILIAR ALREADY BECAUSE THE SAME QUESTION IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER HAS FOR SOME YEARS PAST RECEIVED OCCASIONAL TREATMENT IN OUR EDUCATIONAL JOURNALS AND AT THE MEETINGS OF OUR EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL NOT EXPECT ME TO OPEN UP ANY UNEXPLORED REGIONS WHAT VALUE THERE MAY BE IN MY PAPER READ AT THE FOURTH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF ENGLISH HELD IN BOSTON MASS MARCH I9 I904 349THE SCHOOL REVIEW REMARKS LIES IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE SYSTEM DURING MY CONNECTION WITH THE FACULTY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN THE THEORY OF THE ACCREDITED SCHOOL STATED AS BRIEFLY AS POS SIBLE IS THIS THE SECONDARY SCHOOL PROVES TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE THAT IT IS ABLE TO GIVE ITS PUPILS AN ADEQUATE PREPARATION FOR THE ADVANTAGEOUS PURSUIT OF COLLEGIATE WORK THE JUDGMENT OF THE SCHOOL AS TO THE COMPETENCE OF THE PUPIL TO DO SO IS ACCEPTED AS FINAL THE PUPIL IS IN CONSEQUENCE NOT SUBJECTED TO A TEST BY THE COLLEGE AUTHORITIES LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE FULLY SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS IMPLIED IN THIS THEY LED TO THE ADOPTION OF THIS METHOD OF ADMISSION AND TO THEM IS LARGELY DUE THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH IT HAS SPREAD IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER I THE FIRST CONSIDERATION IN SUPPORT OF THE REASONABLENESS OF THE THEORY IS THE SUPPOSITION THAT AS FAR AS THE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE IS CONCERNED IT HAS SATISFIED ITSELF FIRST BY METHODS ADEQUATE IN ITS JUDGMENT THAT THE COURSE OF STUDY IN THE PREPAR ATORY SCHOOL FULFILS ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTRANCE THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF THE INSTRUCTION MEASURES UP TO THE PROPER STANDARD THAT THE GENERAL INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL TONE OF THE SCHOOL IS GOOD THAT THE UNIVERSITYS CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL ON THE PUPILS ABILITY IS NOT MISPLACED AND THAT THE REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS DEVISED AS SAFEGUARDS ARE EFFECTIVE THINKING THAT A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE SCHOOL AT WORK WILL AFFORD SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF ITS POWER THE UNIVERSITY HAS ADOPTED A METHOD PROMISING NOT ONLY TO PREVENT DETERIORA TION OF SCHOLARSHIPS BUT TO AFFORD BESIDES RELIEF TO ITS OFFICERS IN THE LABOR OF PRELIMINARY EXAMINATIONS ON THE PART OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL THERE IS THE REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT A STRICT BUT SYMPATHETIC SCRUTINY OF ITS WORK REPEATED AND CONSTANT EXAMINATIONS WITH ATTENDANT FRANK DISCUSSIONS CAN REACT BUT FAVORABLY UPON IT AND THAT THIS PROCEDURE WILL AFFORD IT AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT UNDER ABSOLUTELY THE BEST CONDITIONS WHAT IT IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH 2 IN THE SECOND PLACE I MENTION A FACTOR OF VALUE PERHAPS NOT SO MUCH HERE IN THE EAST WHERE THE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES 350THE AFFILIATED SCHOOL IN THEORY AND PRACTICE 351 ARE OF A PRIVATE CHARACTER AS IN THE WEST WITH ITS STATE UNIVERSI TIES AS THE CAPSTONES OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMSVIZ THE DESIRES FOR A CLOSER AFFILIATION BETWEEN THE HIGHER AND THE SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR PURPOSES OF MUTUAL HELPFULNESS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF BOTH FELT THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE INSTITUTIONS THEY WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE NECESSITY OF HAVING THE RELATION BETWEEN THEM AS INTIMATE AS POSSIBLE OF REMOVING ANY WALL OF PARTITION THAT HAD UNNECESSARILY BEEN PUT UP THE UNIVERSITY LOOKED TOWARD THE REALIZATION OF AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF THE STATE AND TOWARD AN INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF THE SAME ON ITS PART THERE WAS THE DESIRE BY HARMONIOUS ACTION WITH THOSE IN CHARGE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS TO BRING ABOUT A MORE PERFECT UNITY OF PLAN AND METHOD IN THE SCHOOLS AND IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THIS OBJECT COULD BE MATERIALLY FURTHERED IF NOT ACCOMPLISHED ENTIRELY BY A CAREFULLY GUARDED MANNER OF ADMITTING PUPILS OF CERTAIN SCHOOLS WITHOUT EXAMINATION BUT THAT THERE WAS ALSO A DESIRE FOR CLOSER ARTICULATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY ON THE PART OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL IS EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM BY THE PIONEER IN THIS MOVEMENT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FOLLOWED PARTLYUPON THE EARNEST SOLICITA TIONS OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BEST HIGH SCHOOLS OF THE STATE THEY SAW THAT UNDER THE CONDITIONS THEN EXISTING THE GAP BETWEEN THE PREPARATORY SCHOOL AND THE UNIVERSITY WAS TOO GREAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT THEY WERE PARTS OF ONE CON NECTED WHOLE THE PUPILS PROMOTION HAD BEEN A NATURAL ONE UNTIL HE CAME TO THE GATES OF THE UNIVERSITY IT WAS FELT TO BE VERY DESIRABLE THAT IF HE WISHED TO CONTINUE HIS STUDIES HE SHOULD BE ENABLED TO ADVANCE AS NATURALLY FROM THE LOWER TO THE HIGHER INSTITUTION AS HE HAD PASSED FROM THE GRAMMAR GRADES TO THE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE SAME SYSTEM 3 A THIRD CONSIDERATION ON WHICH THE THEORY OF THE ACCRED ITED SCHOOL IS BUILT UP IS THIS THAT UNDER THE APPLICATION OF THIS SYSTEM THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PUPILS PREPARATION IS ACTUALLY PLACED WHERE IT BELONGS IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION LIKEWISE REFLECTS TO SOME EXTENT UPON THE INSTITUTION FROM WHICH THE CANDIDATE COMES BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE HIGHER SCHOOL TO BRING HOME THE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SAME7 HE SCHOOL REVIEW MANNER AND WITH THE SAME EFFECT THE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE BY ITS INSPECTION OF THE SCHOOLS WORK AS A WHOLE ASSUMES THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SCHOOL NOT FOR THE SINGLE PUPIL THE ACCEPT ANCE OF THE ACCREDITING RIGHT BY THE SCHOOL IMPLIES A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE ON ITS PART OF THE UNIVERSITYS DEMANDS AND A WILL INGNESS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CANDIDATES PREPARATION THIS IS AS IT SHOULD BE IT MAY IN SOME CASES PROVE AN UNEN VIABLE RESPONSIBILITY BUT A TEACHER WHO HAS AT HEART THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE SCHOOL AND THE PUPIL WILL NOT SHRINK FROM IT AND IT WILL REQUIRE STRONGER ARGUMENTS THAN THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ADVANCED SO FAR TO PROVE THAT THE TEACHING FORCE OF A SCHOOL THROUGH YEARS OF INTIMATE CONTACT WITH THE PUPIL IS NOT BEST QUALIFIED TO GAGE HIS MENTAL AND MORAL ATTAINMENTS AND PRO NOUNCE JUDGMENT UPON HIS QUALIFICATIONS FOR COLLEGIATE WORK 4 ONE MORE CAUSE THAT LED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCREDITING METHOD AND THAT IS A CONSIDERATION IN FAVOR OF THE REASONABLE NESS OF THE THEORY HAS BEEN HINTED AT IN WHAT HAS BEEN SAID SO FAR BOTH PARTIES CONCERNED HAD FOUND THAT THE ENTRANCE EXAMI NATION AS A TEST OF A PUPILS CAPACITY FOR COLLEGE WORK WAS QUITE INADEQUATE IT WOULD SIMPLY BE REHEARSING WHAT IS WELL KNOWN TO YOU IF I WERE TO MARSHAL BEFORE YOU WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ON BOTH SIDES THE CONVINCING FORCE OF CERTAIN ARGUMENTSVIZ THAT THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS ARE MOSTLY TESTS OF KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT ANY EDUCATIONAL VALUE THAT THEY FREQUENTLY FAIL TO ACCOM PLISH THEIR END OF KEEPING OUT PERSONS UNPREPARED AND OF LETTING IN THOSE WHO IN THE OPINION OF EDUCATORS WHO HAVE WATCHED THEIR PROGRESS FOR YEARS ARE WELL FITTED FOR HIGHER WORK THAT IN THE PREPARATION FOR SUCH ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS UNDUE WEIGHT IS ATTACHED TO PREVIOUS EXAMINATION PAPERS TO CROTCHETS AND PET THEORIES OF THE EXAMINERS THAT THEREFORE THE FEARFUL LOOKING TOWARD THEM IS SUBVERSIVE OF GOOD TEACHING NOT ONLY IN SCHOOLS THAT AIM TO BE PREPARATORY SCHOOLS IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE TERM BUT ALSO IN SCHOOLS WHERE NO DIFFERENTIATION SHOULD BE MADE AS TO WHETHER A PUPIL INTENDS TO GO TO COLLEGE OR NOT FURTHER THAT THEY ENCOURAGE MERE MNEMONIC GYMNASTICS WHEREBY THE PUPIL MAY BE ENABLED TO HAVE ATHIS COMMAND THE FACTS CALLED FOR AT THE APPOINTED MOMENT WHILE IT IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE 352THE AFFILIATED SCHOOL IN THEOR Y AND PRACTICE 353 THAT HE SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD CERTAIN TRUTHS IN THEIR DEPEND ENCE ON GENERAL PRINCIPLESI SAY THE FORCE OF ARGUMENTS POINT ING OUT THESE DEFECTS HAS LED OF NECESSITY TO A SEARCH FOR A METHOD THAT IS FREE FROM THEM AND THE WEAKNESSES OF WHICH ARE INSIG NIFICANT COMPARED WITH THE ADVANTAGES IT OFFERS THUS THE ACCREDITED SCHOOL IN THEORY AS BASED NEGATIVELY UPON UNSATISFACTORY EXPERIENCE WITH ANOTHER METHOD AS SUP PORTED POSITIVELY BY CONSIDERATIONS OF HIGH IMPORTANCE AIMS TO FACILITATE THE TRANSITION FROM THE LOWER TO THE HIGHER SCHOOL WITH OUT IN ANY WAY DAMAGING SCHOLARSHIP TO SECURE ECONOMY IN THE INTERACTION OF DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL FACTORS TO GIVE FROM A MORAL POINT OF VIEW TO THOSE WHO ARE ENTITLED TO IT THE BLAME AND THE CREDIT FOR THE STUDENTS FITNESS OR UNFITNESS TO PURSUE COLLEGIATE WORK TO ENABLE THE SECONDARY SCHOOL TO PRESENT ITS FINISHED PRODUCT UNDER CONDITIONS THAT CAN HARDLY BE IMPROVED AND TO IMPRESS AT THE SAME TIME UPON THE SECONDARY SCHOOL THE IDEALS OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THIS IN A MANNER MORE FORCIBLE AND INSIST ENT AND COMPLETE THAN IT CAN POSSIBLY BE DONE BY ANY SET OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATION PAPERS THIS THEORY HAS BEEN IN ACTUAL OPERATION FOR NOT A FEW YEARS IT SHOULD THEREFORE BE ABLE TO VERIFY ITS CLAIMS BY RESULTS IT HAS BEEN APPLIED WITH DIFFERENT MODIFICATIONS BY DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THE EXCELLENT ARTICLE BY MISS SALMON IN THE EDUCATIONAL REVIEW VOL VI PP 223 FF AND PRO FESSOR WHITNEYS COMPREHENSIVE PAPER READ BEFORE THE MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND IN BALTIMORE I902 AND PUBLISHED IN THE SCHOOL REVIEW VOL XI PP 13848 GIVE A LUCID ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS IN USE IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO ENTER UPON ANY DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THEM BUT SINCE MY SUB JECT REQUIRES ME TO SPEAK OF THE AFFILIATED SCHOOL IN PRACTICE ALSO I MUST AT LEAST TOUCH UPON A FEW SALIENT POINTS IN THE ACTUAL WORKING OF THE THEORY I THE SOCALLED CERTIFICATING SYSTEM IN USE IN THE EAST IS WELL KNOWN TO YOU WHETHER THE SCHOOL IS ACCREDITED AS A UNIT OR ONLY IN CERTAIN SUBJECTS IN THE MIDDLE WEST AND THE WEST THE MICHIGAN SYSTEM HAS DEVELOPED CALLED SO BECAUSE ORIGINATED ATTHE SCHOOL REVIEW THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 1872 AND SUCCESSFULLY COPIED BY MOST STATE UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER GREAT SCHOOLS IN THAT TERRITORY ITS DISTINGUISHING FEATURES ARE A THE PERSONAL INSPECTION BY UNIVERSITY OFFICERS OF THE SCHOOLS DESIRING TO BECOME ACCREDITED B THE GRANTING OF CERTIFICATE RIGHTS ONLY FOR A SPECIFIED TIME FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS AFTER WHICH OR AT ANY OTHER TIME WHEN THOUGHT ADVISABLE A REEXAMINATION BECOMES NECESSARY C THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE CANDIDATE FOR ADMISSION PRESENT BESIDES HIS DIPLOMA FROM AN ACCREDITED SCHOOL A SPECIAL CERTIFICATE VOIC ING HIS PRINCIPALS CONVICTION THAT HE IS PROPER UNIVERSITY TIM BER D POSTENTRANCE REPORTS OF THE QUALITY OF HIS WORK IN THE UNIVERSITY SENT DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF HIS RESIDENCE TO THE PRE PARATORY SCHOOL ALL THESE FEATURESTHE LATTER ALSO FOUND IN CON NECTION WITH THE ORDINARY CERTIFICATE SYSTEMARE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO THE WORK OF INSPECTION WAS DONE BY MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY USUALLY FOLLOWING THE APOSTOLIC MANNER OF GOING IN PAIRS ONE TO REPRESENT THE SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS THE OTHER THE LANGUAGES AND HISTORY VARIOUS FAC TORS HOWEVER COMBINED TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENT OF A NEW UNI VERSITY OFFICER NECESSARY CALLED THE UNIVERSITY EXAMINER WHOSE SOLE DUTY IT SHOULD BE TO INSPECT AND REPORT UPON ACCREDITED SCHOOLS THIS FORM OF INSPECTION IS NOW IN VOGUE IN NOT A FEW OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES OF THE NORTHWEST THE MEN SELECTED FOR SUCH A POSITION ARE MOSTLY TAKEN FROM THE RANKS OF SUPERINTEND ENTS AND PRINCIPALS OF WIDE EXPERIENCE AND UNQUESTIONED SUC CESS THEY ARE MEN OF THOROUGH PEDAGOGICAL TRAINING AND SOUND EDUCATIONAL VIEWS PERFECTLY IN SYMPATHY WITH THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND AT THE SAME TIME FULLY CONVERSANT WITH THE IDEALS AND WORKINGS OF THE UNIVERSITIES HOW COMPREHENSIVE THEIR EXAMINATION IS BECOMES EVIDENT FROM A GLANCE AT THE BLANKS FILLED OUT BY THEM CALLING FOR A VARIETY OF INFORMATION THE POPULATION OF THE CITY THE TOTAL ENROLMENT IN THE SCHOOLS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS THEIR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION THE SUBJECTS TAUGHT BY THEM THE CON DUCT OF THEIR CLASSES THEIR EFFICIENCY THE COURSE OF STUDY THE TEXTBOOKS USED LIBRARY FACILITIES LABORATORIES COLLECTIONS THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL ITS INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL TONE THE EDU 354THE AFFILIATED SCHOOL IN THEORY AND PRACTICE 355 CATIONAL SENTIMENT OF THE COMMUNITY THE ATTITUDE OF THE SCHOOL BOARD ETC I HAVE DWELT UPON THIS FEATURE IN THE PRACTICAL WORK ING OF THE THEORY AT LENGTH BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS MOST ESSENTIAL AND PRODUCTIVE OF MUCH GOOD IF REPEATED YEAR AFTER YEAR AS IN CALIFORNIA OR ONLY EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS IT CANNOT HELP BUT ACT AS A SPUR TO FIRSTCLASS TEACHERS AND FIRSTCLASS SCHOOLS TO ESTABLISH A RECORD AND TO MAINTAIN IT AS DR SACHS SAID AT THE MEETINGIN BALTIMORE IT WOULD VASTLY INCREASE THE DIGNITY OF THE SECONDARY TEACHING PROFESSIONA HIGHLY ACCREDITED TEACHER WOULD BECOME A RECOGNIZED FACTOR IN THE COMMUNITY AN ACCRED ITED SCHOOL COULD NOT AFFORD TO DETERIORATEIT WOULD MAINTAIN AT ALL HAZARDS A STAFF OF COMPETENT TEACHERS OR SEEK TO IMPROVE THEM IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THIS FEATURE OF THE ACCREDITED SCHOOL IN PRACTICE COULD BE INTRODUCED IN THIS TERRITORY IS IT NOT BASED ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF ONE CER TAIN HIGHER INSTITUTION FURNISH THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE WORK IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS  IT IS TRUE WE HAVE NO CENTRAL INSTITU TIONS THAT WOULD OCCUPY EXACTLY THE SAME POSITION IN REFERENCE TO ALL SCHOOLS OR ALL PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME QUITE FEASIBLE THAT HERE TOO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS COULD BE ARRIVED AT LOOKING TO A UNIFICATION OF EFFORT EVEN INCLUDING THE FEATURE OF PERSONAL INSPECTION 2 BUT WHAT TANGIBLE RESULTS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY THIS SYS TEM IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION HAVE SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS BEEN REALIZED  HAS THE HOPE OF ESTABLISHING AN EDUCATIONAL SYS TEM THROUGH THIS AFFILIATION BEEN FULFILLED IN THOSE PARTS WHERE THE STATE UNIVERSITY IS THE SUPERVISING AGENT THE ANSWER IS AFFIRMA TIVE AND THERE IS NO INDICATION OF ANY INTENTION TO ABANDON THE METHOD AND TO RETURN TO THE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION NOR ARE MANY VOICES HEARD AMONG TEACHERS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS THAT CALL FOR AN ABOLISHMENT OF THE SYSTEM OF AFFILIATION SOME WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS ON THE GROUND THAT THE PRESSURE OF EXAMINATIONS IS SEVERER ON THE TEACHERS IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS SAYING THAT NOTHING SO HOLDS A TEACHER UP TO HIS GREATEST EFFORT AS THE CER SEE ARTICLE ON THE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA BY L J RICHARDSON IN THE SCHOOL REVIEW VOL X PP 61519THE SCHOOL REVIEW TAINTY THAT HIS WORK IS TO BE JUDGED INEVITABLY AND INEXORABLY BY THE RESULTS OF THE COLLEGEENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS PERSONALLY I BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER METHOD WHERE PROPERLY AND RIGIDLY APPLIED HAS PRODUCED EXACTLY THE RESULTS THAT THE ADVOCATES OF THE THEORY LOOKED FOR AND THE FACT THAT HERE AND THERE AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT HAS BEEN MADE IN THE ADMISSION OF A PUPIL AND THAT SOME SECONDARY SCHOOLS SEEK CERTIFICATE RIGHTS OR SOME COLLEGES GRANT THEM FROM MERCENARY MOTIVES DOES NOT ALTER THE CASE SO FAR AS SECONDARY SCHOOLS ARE CONCERNED THERE HAS BEEN A DECIDED IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR TONE AND A RAISING OF STANDARDS SINCE THE GRANTING OF THE CERTIFICATE RIGHT MEANS FIRST OF ALL A COM PLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HIGHER INSTITUTION THIS LEAVEN HAS SPREAD FROM THE ACCREDITED SCHOOLS TO THOSE LESS ADVANCED STIMULATING THEM TO HIGHER ENDEAVOR SCHOOL BOARDS AND HEADS OFPRIVATE PREPARATORY SCHOOLS HAVE COME TO LOOK UPON THE RIGHT OF CERTIFICATION AS A PRIVILEGE GREATLY TO BE COVETED AND THEY EVINCE USUALLY COMMENDABLE WILLINGNESS TO COMPLY WITH THE WISHES OF THE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WHICH IS PRINCIPALLY THEIR IDEAL IN REGARD TO THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE COURSE OF STUDY INCREASED EQUIPMENT GREATER EFFICIENCY IN THE TEACHING FORCE THE PUPILS THEMSELVES ARE IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT THEIR EDUCATIONAL CAREER DOES NOT NEED TO CLOSE WITH THEIR GRADUATION FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL AND NOT INFREQUENTLY THE INITIAL IMPULSE TO A COLLEGE COURSE COMES FROM THE VISIT OF THE INSPECTING COMMITTEE COUPLED WITH THE PROSPECT OF THE SAVING OF NERVOUS STRAIN THROUGH THE ABSENCE OF AN ENTRANCE EXAMINATION AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE UNI VERSITY IT MAY TRUTHFULLY BE SAID THAT THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM HAS BEEN NO SMALL FACTOR IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS 3 BUT THE QUESTION WHICH AFTER ALL WILL PROVE THE VALUE OF THE METHOD BEST IS THIS DOES IT PROVE ADEQUATE TO TEST THE PUPILS FITNESS FOR COLLEGE WORK IN OTHER WORDS WHAT IS THE STUDENTS POSTENTRANCE RECORD  BESIDES REPORTS OF A GENERAL NATURE THAT COME FROM VARIOUS INSTITUTIONSE G THE CERTIFICATE SYSTEM GIVES US STUDENTS BETTER PREPARED FOR UNIVERSITY WORK  IT GIVES BETTER RESULTS FROM STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE ENTERING ON CERTIFICATE AND THOSE ENTER ING ON EXAMINATION STUDENTS ADMITTED BY CERTIFICATE HAVE 356THE AFFILIATED SCHOOL IN THEORY AND PRACTICE 357 SECURED QUITE AS GOOD AVERAGE STANDING AS THOSE ADMITTED BY EXAMINATION IF THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE IT IS IN FAVOR OF THE FOR MER BESIDES SUCH REPORTS OF A GENERAL NATURE IT APPEARS FROM A TABULATION MADE BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AFTER THE NEW SYSTEM HAD BEEN IN OPERATION FOR NINE YEARS THAT IN THE CASE OF MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND FRESHMEN WHOSE WORK FOR THE FIRST SEMESTER WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE PERCENTAGE OF SCHOLARSHIP OF 470 ADMITTED BY CERTIFICATE WAS 889I THAT OF 574 ADMITTED BY EXAMINATION WAS 8722 CLEARLY PROVING THAT IN RELIABILITY THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM IS NOT BELOW THE EXAMINATION METHOD 4 WHAT NOW IS THE PRACTICAL BEARING OF THIS SYSTEM ON EXAMINATIONS IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE NO TYPE OF THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM CONTEMPLATES THE ABOLISH MENT OF ALL EXAMINATIONS NOT EVEN ITS MOST ARDENT DEFENDERS WOULD ARGUE THAT THESE SHOULD BE DISPENSED WITH ON THE CON TRARY THE STUDENT SHOULD EARLY BE IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT EXAMINATIONS HAVE A DISTINCT EDUCATIONAL VALUE ASIDE FROM BEING TESTS OF HIS ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE REGARDING SOME PARTICULAR SUBJECT AND THE PRACTICE THAT IS OCCASIONALLY INDULGED IN ESPECIALLY TOWARD THE END OF THE PREPARATORY COURSE AND VERY LIKELY MORE IN PRIVATE THAN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF PROMOTING THE PUPIL WITHOUT AN EXAMINATION SHOULD NOT BE COUNTENANCED IT IS AN UNWARRANTED INFERENCE THAT THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM TENDS TO UNDERMINE THE PUPILS SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY HE IS STILL REQUIRED TO PASS EXAMINATIONS TO PROVE THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO PURSUE COLLEGIATE WORK PROPERLY IT IS NOT THE EXAMINATION THAT IS ELIMINATED ONLY THE OUTSIDE EXAMINER THE CONDUCT OF THESE TESTS IS NOW PLACED IN THE HANDS OF PERSONS WHO BECAUSE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM IN THE USUAL SCHOOL PROCESSES WILL BE INTELLIGENT AND DISCRIMINATING JUDGES OF HIS WORK HE WILL BE PLACED UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT TEND LEAST TO DESTROY HIS MENTAL BALANCE AND THAT WILL INSURE HIM AN EQUITABLE TREATMENT JUST AS THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM WILL TEND TO GOOD TEACHING IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL SO IT WILL CONTRIBUTE ITS PART TO MAKING THE CF WHITNEY PROCEEDINGS OF THE SIXTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND PP 25 F THE SAME ADDRESS IN WHICH THIS INFORMATION IS GIVEN WAS PUBLISHED IN THE SCHOOL REVIEW VOL XI PP I3848EDTHE SCHOOL REVIEW EXAMINATIONS OF WHATEVER KIND ESPECIALLY THE FINAL EXAMINATIONS WHAT THEY SHOULD BE MEANS INDISPENSABLE IN THE PROCESS OF EDUCATION TESTS FOR INSTRUCTION AND PROMOTION IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT AN EXAMINATION IS A GOOD TEST OF POWER ACQUIRED BUT THE BEST EXHIBITION OF THIS POWER IS MUCH FACILITATED BY THE APPLI CATION OF THE ACCREDITING METHOD THE COLLEGEENTRANCE EXAMINA TION CANNOT SERIOUSLY LAY CLAIM TO BEING A MEANS OF EDUCATION OR AN ABSOLUTELY SATISFACTORY TEST OF THE PUPILS ACQUIRED POWER WHILE UNDER THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM THE VALUE OF THE EXAMINA TION AS AN EDUCATIONAL FACTOR WILL BE GREATER AND THE TEST ITSELF WILL BE SANER MORE COMPREHENSIVE MORE JUST TO THE PUPIL BETTER CALCULATED TO EXHIBIT THE POWER OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL OF COURSE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE COLLEGEENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS JUST AS LONG AS THERE WILL BE UNACCREDITED SCHOOLS AND PUPILS WITH IRREGULAR PREPARATION WILL THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THESE POSSIBLY NOT AT LEAST ONLY INDIRECTLY THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM WOULD PRODUCE A CLOSER CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COLLEGE AND SECONDARY SCHOOL IT MIGHT BE THAT COLLEGE PROFESSORS THROUGH SUCH INTIMATE CONTACT WOULD BE INFLUENCED AND WOULD APPROACH MORE NEARLY THE IDEAL TEST FOR PUPILS IN PRE PARATORY SCHOOLS IT IS LIKELY THEY WOULD IF THEY WERE ON INSPECT ING COMMITTEES WILL THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON THE EXAMI TIONS IN COLLEGE AFTER THE STUDENT HAS BECOME MATRICULATED NO IF THE PHRASING MEANS ANY CHANGE IN THE METHODS OF EXAM INERS AND THIS SHOULD NOT BE ASKED BUT LET ME PUT THE QUESTION DIFFERENTLY WILL THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM IN ANY WAY AFFECT THE PUPILS POWER TO PASS COLLEGE EXAMINATIONS YES EXAMINA TIONS HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT FACTORS IN HIS INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL DEVELOPMENT SO FAR AND HAVE GIVEN HIM VALUABLE PRELIMINARY DIS CIPLINE THEY HAVE PREPARED HIM FOR SIMILAR TESTS THAT THE COLLEGEENTRANCE EXAMINATION IN GENERAL FULFILS SUCH A PROPAEDEUTIC FUNCTION IS STILL UNPROVED IN CLOSING LET ME SAY A WORD AS TO THE FUTURE OF THE ACCRED ITING SYSTEM THUS FAR IT HAS BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHIN THE OPTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL HIGHER INSTITUTION WHETHER OR NOT A PAR TICULAR SECONDARY SCHOOL SHOULD RECEIVE SUCH RECOGNITION AS IS 358THE AFFILIATED SCROOL IN THEORY AND PRACTICE 359 IMPLIED IN THE ADMISSION OF ITS GRADUATES TO COLLEGE WITHOUT THE ORDEAL OF AN ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BUT THERE ARE INDICATIONS TO SHOW THAT THE FORECAST WAS CORRECT WHICH WAS MADE BY MISS SALMON ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO AS TO THE FEDERATING OF COLLEGES IN THE MATTER OF ACCREDITING SCHOOLS OF CENTRALIZING THE EFFORTS OF THE COLLEGES AND OF SAVING WORRY AND ANNOYANCE TO SECONDARY SCHOOLS OCCASIONED BY REPEATED INSPECTIONS AND HETEROGENEOUS ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS THESE LATTER ARE STILL IN A SOMEWHAT CHAOTIC CONDITION VARYING IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY BUT IF THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM IS TO DO ITS WORK MOST SATISFACTORILY A COM MON BASIS OF REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE ADOPTED THIS SEEMS TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL NEED NOT THAT THE SAME HARD AND FAST DEMANDS BE MADE BY ALL COLLEGES BUT THAT ESSENTIALLY UNIFORM OR AT LEAST EQUIVALENT ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS BE ESTABLISHED THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PRINCIPAL OF A LARGE HIGH SCHOOL IN OHIO WITH WHOM I HAD A CONVERSATION A FEW WEEKS AGO IS INTERESTING IN THIS CONNECTION HE HAD FOUND BY ACTUAL COMPUTATION THAT IF HE WISHED HIS PUPILS TO BE READY TO ENTER ANY ONE OF TWENTYTWO UNIVERSITIES AND GREAT COLLEGES IN THE COUNTRY WHICH THEY MIGHT DESIRE TO ATTEND AT THE END OF THEIR PREPARATORY COURSE WITHOUT BEING SHORT IN ANY SUB JECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS WOULD IMPOSE UPON THEM MORE THAN SIXTEEN SEMESTERS OF WORK THE NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE ENTRANCE CERTIFICATE BOARD HAS COME INTO EXISTENCE RECENTLY THE TIME HAS NOT YET COME TO PRONOUNCE JUDGMENT UPON THE PRACTICAL WORKINGS OF THE SYSTEM WHICH IT HAS ADOPTED THE ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL STATES HAS FORMED A PERMANENT  COMMISSION ON ACCREDITED SCHOOLS WITH A SUBCOMMITTEE ON HIGH SCHOOL INSPECTION FROM THE REPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE SOON TO BE SUPPLEMENTED BY A LIST OF ACCREDITED SCHOOLS IT APPEARS THAT THIS ASSOCIATION LOOKED WELL TO THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH IT WOULD BASE ITS CONCERTED ACTION IN THE ACCREDITING OF SCHOOLS BECAUSE IT EXPRESSED ITS FIRM BELIEF THAT THE BASAL FACTOR IN ANY PLAN LOOKING TOWARD A REASONABLY UNIFORM SYSTEM OF ACCREDITED SCHOOLS IS NECESSARILYTHE COURSEOF STUDY  ITS FIRSTRECOMMENDATIONS LOOKED THEREFORE TO THE SETTING UP OF A STANDARD BY WHICH TO MEASURE THE ELIGIBILITY OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS360 THE SCHOOL REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THIRTEEN FOR A POINT OF DEPARTURE THE COMMISSION DEFINED AND DESCRIBED UNIT COURSES OF STUDY IN THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS OF THE HIGHSCHOOL CURRICULUM THIS REPORT WAS ADOPTED BY THE ASSOCIATION AND THE ADOPTION OF SUCH A BASIS OF FEDERATION WILL PROVE A GREAT STEP FORWARD IN THE SIMPLI FICATION OF THE SYSTEM AND THE EFFICIENCY

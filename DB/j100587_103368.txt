HAVE DOUBTLESS BEEN SURPRIZED AGAIN AFRESH BY THE WONDERFUL LIGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEEN SEVE RAL TIMES OF LATE LIKE THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS SEEN ON MARCH 6 1716 MONDAY THE 26 OF OCTOBER BETWEEN 7 AND 8 IN THE EVENING I SAW SOME SMALL APPEARANCE OF IT VIZ 3 OR 4 LARGE CORUSCATIONS IN FORM OF PYRAMIDS OF REDDISH CO LOUR INCLINING TO YELLOW WHICH ROSE ABOUT 50 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND CONTINUED BUT FEW MINUTES BUT THE NORTH PART OF THE HEMISPHERE WAS VERY BRIGHT AND RED ALL THE EVENING BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER TILL TEN IF NOT LONGER TUESDAY NOVEMB 10 THESE LIGHTS WERE SEEN AGAIN A BOUT 4 IN THE MORNING OF WHICH SOME SAY TO USE THEIR OWN EXPRESSIONS THAT THE ELEMENT OPENED SOMETIME AT ONE PLACE THEN AT OTHER FROM WHENCE CAME GREAT SHINING LIGHTS THAT CONTINUED A WHILE AND THEN WENT A WAY BY DEGREES AND THE HOLES CLOSED UP AGAIN THIS CONTINUED TILL DAY BREAK THE EVENING FOLLOWING COMING FROM TYVERTON ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER EIGHT I SAW THE NORTH PART OF THE HORIZON VERY LIGHT AND REDDISH NOTWITHSTANDING THE MOON BEING ABOUT 10 DAYS OLD WAS THEN IN OR PAST THE MERIDIAN AND SHONE VERY BRIGHT IN A SHORT TIME THE STREAMING LUMINOUS RAYS BEGAN TO APPEAR VERY PLAIN SOME IN ONE SHAPE SOME ANOTHER MANY OF THEM 10 G 2 LIKE1102 LIKE CONES OR PYRAMIDS BUT MOST OF THEM BADLY TER MINATED SOME OF WHICH MOUNTED VERY HIGH ALMOST TO THE ZENITH TO WHICH PLACE OR NEAR THEY ALL OR MOST SEEMED TO POINT SHORTLY AFTER THERE APPEARED A LONG STREAK OF ABOUT 30 DEGREES PARALLEL TO THE HORIZON AND ABOUT 15 OR 20 DISTANT FROM IT AND ABOUT 2 OR 3 BROAD BUT BADLY TERMINATED AND OF A FIERY RED COLOUR WHICH SENT OUT SOME OF THE SAME STREAMING BEAMS TOWARDS THE ZE NITH ABOUT 6 OR 7 MINUTES AFTER THERE APPEARED SOME WHAT SUDDEN A CIRCULAR FIGURE LIKE AN IRIS BUT TWICE AS BROAD OF A PALE COLOUR THE FAST PART WAS TERMINA TED BY THE HORIZON AT FULL EAST IF NOT SOMETHING TO THE SOUTH AND THE WEST END ABOUT NORTH WEST THE UP PER PART OF ITS ARCH BEING 50 OR 60 DEGREES HIGH GREAT NUMBERS OF LUMINOUS RAYS DARTED FROM IT UP WARD AND DOWNWARDS OR ELSE PASSING CROSS IT FROM THE HORIZON AT OBLIQUE ANGLES POINTING TO THE ZENITH ES PECIALLY FROM THE NORTH EAST PART THIS CONTINUED AS NEAR AS I CAN GUESS BY THE DISTANCE I RODE ABOUT 8 OR 9 MINUTES WHEN IT DIVIDED AND DISAPPEARED AFTER AN INTERVAL OF 3 OR 4 MINUTES ANOTHER INFERREDIRISINFERREDLIKE FIGURE APPEARED OF A COLOUR AS IT SEEMED PALER THAN ANY OF THE STREAMING LIGHTS HAD BEEN WHOSE DIAMETER WAS LESS THAN THAT OF THE FORMER AND SHEWED MORE THAN ITS SE MICIRCLE ABOVE THE HORIZON THE UPPER PART OF ITS ARCH APPROACHING NEAR THE ZENITH I COULD NOT OBSERVE ANY RAYS TO PASS FROM OR ACROSS THIS AS FROM THE OTHER THE CENTRE OF THIS LAST WAS MUCH MORE TO THE WEST THAN THAT OF THE FIRST AFTER THE CONTINUANCE OF A MINUTE OR TWO IT BEGAN TO BREAK IN THE UPPER PART OF ITS ARCH AND SHINING PARTICLES BEING SENT OUT FROM BOTH ITS BROKEN ENDS TOWARDS THE ZENITH TO WHICH THEY WERE NEAR BE FORE OR RATHER A LITTLE BEYOND IT TO THE SOUTH OR SOUTH WEST THEY THERE FORMED A SORT OF CORONA CURVING AND BENDING SOMEWHAT LIKE FLAMES REVERBERATED ON THE ARCH OF1103 OF AN OVEN THO THIS EXPRESSETH IT BUT BADLY YET I KNOW NOT HOW TO DESCRIBE IT BETTER IT SEEMED TO ME AND OTHERS TO BE FINELY TINGED WITH VARIOUS COLOURS REDYELLOW AND BLUEISH C AND SENT OUT EVERY WAY FROM IT EXCEPT SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST LONG FLAMECO LOURED RAYS AFTER THIS HAD CONTINUED ABOUT TWO MI NUTES ITS SHINING LIGHT ABATED AND IT LEFT BEHIND IT FOR SOME MINUTES SOMETHING LIKE A WHITISH CLOUD LIKE IN COLOUR TO WHAT THE LIGHT ON THE 19TH OF MARCH LAST LEFT BEHIND IT AFTER THE FIERY PARTICLES WERE EXTINGUISHED BUT THINNER N B ALL THIS WHILE THE MOON SHONE VERY BRIGHT FROM WHICH THIS CORONA WAS NOT VERY FAR DISTANT PER HAPS NOT TWENTY DEGREES TO THE NORTH EAST AFTER THIS THERE CONTINUED TO BE SENT UP MANY FIERY COLOURED OR YELLOWISH STREAMING LIGHTS SOMETIMES MORE SOME TIMES LESS NOW HERE NOW THERE ALL ALONG THE NORTH PART OF THE HEMISPHERE BUT MOSTLY FROM THE NORTH NORTH EAST ALL THIS WHILE SOMETHING LIKE SMALL WHITISH CLOUDS WHICH TO ME SEEMED TO MOVE TOWARDS THE ZE NITH OR TO POINT A LITTLE MORE SOUTHWARD BUT DISAP PEARD AS THEY APPROACHED THE MOON WERE CARRIED VE RY SWIFTLY AND AT VERY SHORT INTERVALS MOSTLY COMING FROM THE EAST AND NORTH EAST BUT MANY ALSO FROM NORTH AND NORTH WEST WE TOOK BUT LITTLE NOTICE OF THIS AT FIRST SUPPOSING IT HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT THE RE FLECTION OF THE OTHER LIGHTS OR THE SHADOWS OF THE CLOUDS WHEREOF THE INFERREDNORTHINFERRED INFERREDPARTSINFERRED WERE PRETTY FULL AS THE STREAMS OF LIGHT PAST BEHIND THEM BUT AT LAST WE OBSERVED THAT WHEN THE LIGHTS AT ANY TIME ABATED THESE KIND OF CLOUDS CONTINUED TO FLY AS SWIFT AND FREQUENT AS EVER THIS I SAW TILL TWELVE OR ONE NEXT MORNING MANY OTHERS SAW IT NEXT MORNING TILL AL MOST BREAK OF DAY WHEN IT APPEARED MUCH MORE RED AND FIERY THAN IT WAS IN THE EVENING THE MOON PERHAPS BEING1104 BEING THEN SET SOME PEOPLE OBSERVED TALL CONES TO ARISE IN

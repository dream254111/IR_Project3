whole the meeting was a most en joyable one and the 75 to 100 Fellows who were in attendance returned to their homes with appreciative and grateful feelings to the geologists of Washington by whom they had been so hospitably entertained J F KEMP 99 AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY THE annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society was held in Hamilton Hall Columbia University on Wednesday afternoon December 301896 The Presi dent Dr George W Hill occupied the chair and there were twentyfour members in attendance Profs T W Edmondson and J L Patterson were elected to mem bership The Secretarys report showed a total membership of 279 being a net gain of 12 for the year Reports were also re ceived from the Librarian and the Treasurer The Bulletin of the Society has appeared regularly through the year being at present in the sixth annual volume The last com plete volume is a substantial octavo of 354 pages The annual election was held at this meeting the following ticket being adopted President Prof Simon Newcomb Vice President Prof R S Woodward Secre tary Prof F N Cole Treasurer Prof Harold Jacoby Librarian Prof Pomeroy Ladue Committee of Publication Prof T S Fiske Prof Alexander Ziwet Prof Frank Morley Members of the Council to serve until December 1899 Prof Alfred Baker Dr George W Hill Dr Emory McClin tock Three papers were presented abstracts of which are given below Prof Morley of Haverford College read a paper on the construction of a single point covariant with five given points Taking the five points 1 2 3 4 5 on a conic U and taking Gundelfingers conic for any four let the intersection of the polars of the fifth point with respect to the two conics be found the 5 points so obtained lie on a line which strikes U at the zeros of a quadratic covariant Salmons S By taking the polar of the five points with re gard to this covariant pair counted thrice we obtain a covariant point readily identi fied as the second of Salmons list For JANUARY 15 1897100 SCIENCE this a geometric construction was given The constructions involve the ruler alone as is proper when a single point is to be found Prof Alexander S Chessin of the Johns Hopkins University gave a brief ac count of his investigations on the motion of a physical pendulum taking into ac count the rotation of the earth about its axis He showed that when the relative velocity of the pendulum is zero as in the famous experiment of Foucault the motion of the axis of the pendulum can be repre sented as composed of two simultaneous motions 1 of the motion on a very flat closed conic surface this surface having a plane of symmetry which would be the plane of oscillations of the pendulum but for the disturbance due to the rotation of the earth and 2 of the rotation of this conic surface about the vertical of the point of suspension The conic surface being very flat it will seem to an observer as if the axis of the pendulum oscillated in the plane of the vertical of the point of suspension while at the same time this apparent plane of oscillations rotated about the vertical In Foucaults experiment the rotation of the apparent plane of oscilla tions took place clockwise Prof Chessin showed that this rotation depended on the construction of the pendulum namely if the pendulum be properly constructed and the amplitude of oscillations be suf ficiently great then the rotation of the apparent plane of oscillations could take place as well clockwise as contra clock wise or even not take place at all This in teresting phenomenon could be observed best at places near the equator because the angular velocity of rotation of the apparent plane of oscillations is composed of two terms one proportional to the sin the other  See American Journal of Mathematics Vol XVII p 86 Johns Hopkins University Circulars Vol XIV No 118 p 64 N S VOL V No 107 to the cos of the latitude of the place of observation The contra clockwise rota tion is due to the presence of the cosine term and is maximum on the equator In concluding Prof Chessin emphatically urged experiments which would verify his calculations Prof E W Brown of Haverford Col lege made a brief statement of the prog ress of his calculation of the solar in equalities in the lunar theory The mo tion of the node was compared with Han sens result and with that given by ob servation An explanation was also given of the slow convergence of the series which represents the principal part of the secular acceleration of the moons mean motion Following a pleasant custom of previous years several of the members dined together after the meeting F N COLE Secretary CURRENT NOTES ON ANTHROPOLOG Y DIVINATORY AND CALENDRICAL DIAGRAMS AT the American folklore meeting Mr Stewart Culin exhibited and explained several divinatory diagrams from Thibet China and Corea and called attention to their close similarity to the socalled cal endarwheels  and the tonalamatl or book of days of ancient Mexico He pointed out that the fundamental conceptions of both are identical and that both developed in to games such as parcheesi in India and patolli in Mexico the Chinese game of pro motion and the European  game of goose These all begin with the numerical con cept of the four expressed in four arms like a cross or four houses or squares which latter by multiplication may be 12 16 64 etc This primary concept ex pressed the original notion of the four quarters i e of the world and by exten sion of the cosmos time as well as space The relation of each individual to the All was the notion which imparted the divina

LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY PHILADELPHIA IN DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT OF LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENTS THE FOL LOWING TOPICS WILL BE BRIEFLY CONSIDERED FIRSTHOW LIFE COMPANIES DIFFER FROM OTHER INVESTORS SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS TRUST COMPANIES OR BANKS SECONDREQUIREMENTS OF THE STATUTES OF THE DIFFERENT STATES THIRDINVESTMENTS REGARDED AS MOST SUITABLE FOR LIFE INSUR ANCE COMPANIES FOURTHMANAGEMENT OF INVESTMENTS BY WHOM PLACED AND THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN FIFTHTHE EXTENT OF LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENTS SIXTHTAXATION OF THE ASSETS HOW LIFE COMPANIES DIFFER FROM OTHER INVESTORS THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR UNLESS ACTING AS TRUSTEE IS UNDER NO RESTRICTION AND IS GOVERNED MERELY BY THE DICTATES OF HIS OWN SWEET WILL FOR OUR PURPOSE THEREFORE WE NEED NOT DISCUSS THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR ASIDE FROM THE DETAIL OF CIRCULATION WITH WHICH EVERY ONE IS MORE OR LESS FAMILIAR A NATIONAL BANK DEVOTES ITS ATTENTION CHIEFLY TO THE RECEPTION OF DEPOSITS FROM BUSINESS FIRMS AND OTHERS AND THE LENDING OF MONEY TO THEM IT IS ALSO A BUYER OF COMMERCIAL PAPER MOREOVER THE BANK WHICH CREDITS YOUR ACCOUNT WITH CASH DEPOSITED AT THREE OCLOCK TODAY MUST IF REQUIRED PREPARE TO MEET YOUR CHECK TOMORROW IT MUST THEREFORE KEEP IN ACTUAL MONEY A SUFFICIENT PROPORTION OF ITS RESOURCES TO SUPPLY THESE DAILY NEEDS FURTHER 256LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENTS MORE AS DEPOSITS ARE DRAWN UPON IN TIMES OF MONETARY PRESSURE A LARGE PART OF ITS ASSETS MUST BE OF THAT KIND WHICH CAN BE QUICKLY CONVERTED INTO CASH SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS GOVERNMENT STATE MUNIC IPAL AND STANDARD RAILROAD BONDS THE TRUST COMPANY ACTS AS TRUSTEE EXECUTOR ADMINISTRATOR GUARDIAN ATTORNEY ETC ITS MUCH ADVERTISED ADVANTAGES OVER AN INDIVIDUAL IN THESE CAPACITIES BEING THAT THE TRUST COMPANY DOES NOT DIE PRESUMABLY HAS NO BAD HABITS AND IS CUSTOMARILY MORE RESPONSI BLE THAN IS THE INDIVIDUAL TRUST COMPANIES ALSO TAKE MONEY ON DEPOSIT THEY DO NOT ISSUE BANK NOTES AND GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE NOT DEALERS IN COM MERCIAL PAPER THEIR LOANS BEING ALMOST ALWAYS PROTECTED BY PLEDGE OF COLLATERAL SECURITY SOME OF THEM FOR INSTANCE THOSE OF MASSA CHUSETTS LIKE THE SAVINGS FUND SOCIETIES ARE RESTRICTED AS TO THE IN VESTMENTS THEY MAY PURCHASE THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN PENNSYLVANIA MANY OF THEIR TRUSTS ARE DISTRIBUTABLE IN KIND OTHERS BECOME PAYABLE AT FIXED DATES IN THE DISTANT FUTURE THUS AFFORDING AMPLE TIME TO PREPARE FOR SETTLEMENT TRUST COMPANIES CONSEQUENTLY BECOME BUY ERS OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES MUNICIPAL AND CORPORATION BONDS BEAR ING A FAIR RATE OF INTEREST AND WHICH WHILE GOOD DO NOT FOR THEIR PURPOSE NEED TO BE INSTANTLY MARKETABLE WITH RESPECT TO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE MOST PROGRESSIVE ONES ISSUE INSURANCE CONTRACTS PROMISING LOANS OR CASH SURRENDER VALUES UPON DEMAND OF THE INSURED TO FORTIFY THEMSELVES AGAINST THIS FEATURE OF THE BUSINESSAGAINST THESE OBLIGATIONS MATURING ON DLEMANDTHE COMPANIES WHICH ISSUE THEM CARRY A SAFE PROPORTION OF THEIR FUND IN COLLATERAL LOANS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE READILY EXCHANGEABLE FOR CASH ASIDE FROM THESE DEMAND OBLIGATIONS THE CHIEF LIFE INSURANCE LIABILITY IS FOR THE PAYMENT OF MATURING ENDOWMENTS AND OF DEATH LOSSES OF THE MATURITY OF AN ENDOWMENT POLICY THE COMPANY HAS FROM TEN TO TWENTY OR MORE YEARS NOTICE DEATH LOSSES ON THE AVERAGE OCCUR SO CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE YEARLY ESTIMATES SO SAFELY WITHIN WHAT ARE TECHNICALLY KNOWN AS THE TABLES OF MOR TALITY THAT LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENTS DO NOT NEED TO BE SO QUICKLY SALABLE FOR CASH AS IS THE CASE WITH THOSE OF MOST FINANCIAL INSTITU TIONS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE NOT CLOSELY RESTRICTED IN THE TERRITORY TO WHICH THEY MUST CONFINE INVESTMENTS THEY MAY PUR CHASE ALMOST ANYTHING WHICH COULD BE LAWFULLY OWNED BY A BANK 257 77THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY A TRUST COMPANY OR A SAVINGS SOCIETY EXCEPT THAT THEY DO NOT BUY COMMERCIAL PAPER LEND UPON PERSONAL CREDIT OR ADVANCE MONEY WITHOUT COLLATERAL SECURITY FOR THIS REASON ONE NEVER FINDS THE NAME OF A LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY UPON A LIST OF UNSECURED CREDITORS THE BANKER MUST KEEP WITHIN EASY REACH A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR EMERGENCIES THROWING OUT THE CASH SURRENDER AND POLICY LOAN ITEMS THE LIFE INSURANCE OFFICIAL ON THE CONTRARY HAS NO EMERGENCIES TO MEET THE DAILY CLAIMS AGAINST HIM ARE SO ACCURATELY FORETOLD THAT HE HAS NO NEED FOR A LARGE CASH BALANCE BUT RATHER MAKES IT HIS DUTY TO KEEP THIS ITEM AT THE LOWEST POINT CONSISTENT WITH CONVENIENCE THUS IDLE AND UNPRODUCTIVE BALANCES BY MOST COMPANIES ARE AVOIDED WE WILL NOW CONSIDER THE SECOND SPECIFI CATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATUTES OF THE DIFFERENT STATES MOST OF THE LARGER COMPANIESTHOSE COMPANIES WHICH HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME AND WHICH HAVE ASSET ACCUMULATIONS OF IMPOR TANCEWERE ESTABLISHED LONG BEFORE LIFE INSURANCE HAD BECOME GEN ERALLY UNDERSTOOD THEIR CHARTERS WERE FRAMED BEFORE KNOWLEDGE WAS ACQUIRED RESPECTING MANY FEATURES OF THE BUSINESS LATER FOUND ESSENTIAL AND WERE IN SOME INSTANCES SO FRAMED AS INCONVENIENTLY TO LIMIT THE COMPANYS SELECTION OF INVESTMENTS IN MANY CASES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND CUMBERSOME THESE OLD CHARTERS HAVE BEEN AMENDED TO CONFORM TO MODERN NEEDS AND THE COMPANIES HAVE THEREBY GAINED LARGER LIBERTY OF INVESTMENT PURCHASE GENERALLY SPEAKING IT MAY BE SAID AS ALREADY INTIMATED THAT THERE IS NO IMPORTANT STATUTORY RESTRICTION UPON THE SUBJECT OF PUR CHASING SECURITIES THE VARIOUS COMPANIES HOWEVER TRANSACT THE BUSINESS OF LIFE INSURANCE IN ALMOST ALL THE STATES AND THE STATES IN TURN HAVE DEPARTMENTS OF INSURANCEFOR THE MOST PART UNDER TRAINED INSURANCE MEN AUTHORIZED TO REVOKE THE LICENSE IN THAT STATE OF ANY COMPANY NOT ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE STRICTEST TEST OF SOLVENCY THERE IS A LARGE DISCRETION VESTED IN EACH STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AS TO WHAT ASSET SHALL AND WHAT SHALL NOT BE ACCEPTED AT ITS FACE THIS UNDEFINED AND TO SOME EXTENT UNCERTAIN STANDARD OF PERSONAL JUDGMENTTHIS VAGUE UNMEASURED DISCRETIONARY POWER OF REJEC TIONPERHAPS MORE THAN ANY STATUTORY REQUIREMENT COULD DO CAUSES 258 78LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENTS THE LIFE INSURANCE MANAGEMENT TO BE EXTREMELY CRITICAL AS TO WHAT FORM OF SECURITY SHALL AND WHAT SHALL NOT APPEAR UPON ITS LIST THERE IS NOW MUCH TALK OF FEDERAL INSTEAD OF STATE SUPERVISION OVER LIFE INSURANCE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISIONS SO FAR HAVE NOT BEEN BROAD ENOUGH TO INCLUDE LIFE INSURANCE WITHIN THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS INTERSTATE COMMERCE UNTIL THIS COURT ASSIGNSA WIDER MEANING TO THAT TERM THE PROPOSED FEDERAL SUPERVISION IS NOT LIKELY TO OCCUR WE NOW COME TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH TOPICS OF OUR INQUIRY NAMELY INVESTMENTS REGARDED AS MOST SUITABLE FOR LIFE INSURANCE COM PANIES AND MANAGEMENT OF INVESTMENTS BY WLHOM PLACED AND THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN THE EXECUTIVE STAFF OF A LARGE LIFE COMPANY IS USUALLY COMPOSED OF MEN WHOSE ENERGY IS NOT EXPENDED UPON THE LESSER DETAILS OF COR PORATE MANAGEMENT IT SEEMS TO BE THEIR AIM HOWEVER TO HAVE EACH DEPARTMENT CONDUCTED BY SOME ONE WHO IS A SPECIALIST IN THAT PARTICULAR LINE THIS SPECIALIST IN TURN MUST HAVE TRAINED AND EFFICIENT MEN UNDER HIM NOT ONLY TO ASSIST BUT TO ACT AS UNDER STUDIES SO TO SPEAKMEN WHO ARE QUALIFIED TO ASSUME ANY RE SPONSIBILITY WHICH MAY DEVOLVE UPON THEM SO THAT THE ABSENCE OR INABILITY OF ANY ONE MAN SHALL NOT STOP THE WHEELS OF BUSINESS THE FINANCIAL MAN FOR INSTANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGENCY THE MATHEMATICAL OR THE MEDICAL DEPART MENT EACH OF WHICH IS CONDUCTED BY SOME ONE WHO HAS PERHAPS DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO THE STUDY OF HIS OWN PARTICULAR SPECIALTY WITH RESPECT TO THE SELECTION AND PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTS IT MAY BE SAID THAT IN ADDITION TO REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES WHICH ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT AND WILL BE TREATED LATER INVESTMENTS REGARDED AS MOST SUITABLE FOR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES APPEAR TO STAND AS TO SAFETY IN ABOUT THE FOLLOWING ORDER NAMELY GOVERNMENT STATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS STANDARD RAILROAD BONDS EQUIPMENT OR CAR TRUST BONDS 259 79THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BONDS OF ELECTRIC RAILWAYS OF DEVELOPED EARNING CAPACITY BONDS UPON PUBLIC UTILITY ENTERPRISES BONDS OF INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS AND STOCKS OF CORPORATIONS REAL ESTATE WILL BE CONSIDERED LATER ON THERE ARE OBJECTIONS TO EACH CLASS AND IT IS THE DUTY OF THE OFFICER WHO BUYS TO BE SO FAMILIAR WITH EACH OBJECTION THAT IT MAY BE GIVEN FULL WEIGHT DURING CONSIDERATION OF A PURCHASE THE FIRST FOUR NAMEDGOVERNMENT AND STATE BONDS AND MUNI CIPAL AND STANDARD RAILROAD BONDS OF HIGHEST GRADEPRODUCE AN INTEREST RETURN SO LOW THAT THE MARGIN IF ANY IS QUITE SMALL OVER THE INTEREST REQUIRED UPON THE COMPANYS RESERVE THIS IS THE OBJECTION TO INVESTMENTS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY YET ALL GOOD COMPANIES BUY THEM IN ORDER TO SUPPLY A LARGE PROPORTION OF WHAT ARE KNOWN AS QUICK ASSETSASSETS WHICH CAN BE CONVERTED INTO CASH WITH LEAST DELAY AND WITH LEAST DANGER OF LOSS THROUGH SERIOUS DEPRECIATION EQUIPMENT OR CAR TRUST BONDSRENT FOR THE USE OF ROLLING STOCK IS NOW CONSIDERED ONE OF THE FIRST CHARGES UPON THE EARNINGS OF A RAILROAD COMPANY EQUIPMENT BONDS THEREFORE ISSUED BY STRONG RAILWAY CORPORATIONS AND SECURED BY TRUST DEED UPON ROLLING STOCK ARE AT PRESENT A FAVORED FORM OF INVESTMENT BUT ARE OPEN TO THE OBJECTION THAT THEY DO NOT FURNISH A SUFFICIENTLY PERMANENT OCCUPA TION FOR THE FUND EQUIPMENT OR CAR TRUST BONDS ARE ISSUED BY THE RAILWAY COMPANIES FOR FROM 70 TO GO PER CENT OF THE EQUIPMENTS COST AND PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL PAYMENTS OF IO PER CENT OR MORE IN REDUCTION OF THE PRINCIPAL DEBT WHICH PAYMENTS WILL RETIRE THE EQUIPMENT BONDS IN FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS AND CLASS THEM AS TEM PORARY INVESTMENTS IT IS MADE THE DUTY OF THE TRUSTEE THROUGH WHICH THESE CAR TRUST BONDS ARE ISSUED TO SEE THAT THE CARS ARE KEPT IN GOOD REPAIR THAT NEW ONES ARE PURCHASED MARKED AND NUMBERED IN PLACE OF THOSE DESTROYED BY FIRE OR ACCIDENT AND THAT AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF FIRE INSUR ANCE IS ALWAYS KEPT IN FORCE THE VITAL POINT TO INSURE THE SAFETY OF AN INVESTMENT IN CAR TRUST BONDS IS THE TRUSTEES RIGID ENFORCE MENT OF THESE CONDITIONS BANKING HOUSES WHICH ARE MOST SUCCESS FUL IN CREATING A MARKET FOR CAR TRUST BONDS ARE OR SHOULD BE THOSE WHICH ARE MOST NOTED FOR THE CARE WHICH THEY REQUIRE TO BE TAKEN BY THE TRUSTEE IN THE CARRYING OUT OF THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTRACT AS IS KNOWN THERE IS NOW PENDING A POLITICAL AGITATION 260 80LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENTS UPON THE SUBJECT OF RAILROAD REBATES IN RETURN FOR THE USE OF PRIVATE FREIGHT CARS OWNED BY LARGE SHIPPERS THIS INCLINES INVESTORS TO DIS APPROVE CAR TRUSTS NOT ISSUED BY THE RAILWAY COMPANIES THEMSELVES BONDS OF ELECTRIC RAILWAYSBONDS UPON NONCOMPETITIVE STREET RAILWAYS LOCATED IN DENSELY POPULATED AND RAPIDLY GROWING CITIES ARE LOOKED UPON WITH FAVOR PROVIDED THE NET EARNINGS ARE SATISFACTORY AND THE RAILWAY COMPANYS FRANCHISE IS NOT DEFECTIVE BONDS UPON SUBURBAN AND INTERURBAN ELECTRIC RAILWAYS ARE RARELY PURCHASED BY THE LIFE COMPANIES UNTIL THE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED A SUFFICIENT LENGTH OF TIME TO DEMONSTRATE AN EARNING CAPACITY AMPLE TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES INTEREST AND A CONSIDERABLE SURPLUS THE OBJECTIONABLE FEATURE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS FORM OF SECURITY BEING THAT THE DEPRECIATION OF THE PLANT OF AN ELECTRIC RAIL WAY IS THOUGHTBY SOME PERSONS WELL INFORMEDTO REPRESENT A SUM OF MONEY ALMOST EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE INTEREST UPON ITS DEBT IF THIS BE TRUE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY COMPANYS BOND SHOULD REST UPON A PROPERTY PRODUCING NET EARNINGS OF APPROXI MATELY DOUBLE THE INTEREST CHARGE BONDS UPON PUBLIC UTILITY ENTERPRISES SUCH AS GAS WATER ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER COMPANIES ARE NOT SPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE TO THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY THEY DEPEND SO MUCH UPON LEGISLATIVE FRANCHISE AND ARE SO OPEN TO ATTACK THROUGH THIS CHANNEL AND THROUGH MISUNDERSTANDINGS WITH MUNICIPALITIES INVOLVED THAT LIFE INSURANCE MANAGERS LOOK UPON THEM WITH FAVOR ONLY AFTER THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION FOR INSTANCE IT MAY BE SAID OF WATER WORKS PLANTS THAT THOUGH WATER IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY AND THE PLANTS FURNISHING IT HAVE THEREFORE BEEN THOUGHT SOUND AS A BASIS FOR INVESTMENT YET WATER PLANTSERECTED AND OPERATED AS PRIVATE ENTERPRISESHAVE BEEN A MOST FRUITFUL SOURCE OF LITIGATION AND OF RESULTING LOSS TO BOND HOLDERS BONDS OF INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS ARE RARELY PURCHASED BY THE MOST CONSERVATIVE COMPANIES THEY ARE SO DEPENDENT UPON THAT PER SONAL FEATURE WHICH STANDS FOR GOOD MANAGEMENT AND SO AFFECTED BY INDUSTRIAL DEPRESSIONS THAT WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS THEY ARE DISAP PROVED STOCKS OF CORPORATIONSTHE ADVERTISING PAGES OF THE CURRENT MAGAZINES REVEAL AN EMPHATIC STATEMENT BY ONE WELLKNOWN COMPANY THAT IT IS NOW THE OWNER OF NO CORPORATION STOCKS OF ANY DESCRIPTION 26I 8ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FROM THIS WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT FOR THE PRESENT STOCKS ARE NOT BEING LARGELY PURCHASED BY THE CONSERVATIVE LIFE INSURANCE COM PANIES THOUGH SOME OF THE COMPANIES HAVE GREATLY PROFITED BY THE RISE IN VALUE OF THEIR STOCKS IN BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES REAL ESTATEREAL ESTATE IS HARDLY CONSIDERED AN INVESTMENT BY THE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY EXCEPT AS INCIDENTAL TO THE PROPERTYS OTHER USES MANY COMPANIES OWN OFFICE BUILDINGS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN ADDITION TO FURNISHING SPACE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS PRODUCE AN ADEQUATE NET INTEREST RETURNMANY OF THEM DO NOTBUT THEY ALL SERVE THE ORIGINAL ADVERTISING PURPOSE OF KEEPING THE COMPANY BEFORE THE PUBLIC EYE REAL ESTATE OTHER THAN THESE OFFICE BUILDINGS THUS VOLUNTARILY ACQUIRED USUALLY CONSISTS OF THOSE PROPERTIES PURCHASED PERFORCE UNDER FORECLOSURE OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES AND REFLECTS GOOD OR BAD MANAGEMENT AS THE CASE MAY BEIN THE COMPANYS MORTGAGE DEPART MENT OWNERSHIP OF A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF FORECLOSED REAL ESTATE BEING CONSIDERED AN EVIDENCE OF GOOD MANAGEMENT FIRST MORTGAGES UPON REAL ESTATE SECURITYTHIS LINE OF SECURITY WHICH AS YET I HAVE SCARCELY MENTIONED IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IT IS THIS PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT BUSINESS WHICH WELL MANAGED WILL PRODUCE THE LARGEST INTEREST RETURN COMMENSURATE WITH SAFETY WHICH PROPERLY CONDUCTED IMPOSES UPON THE INVESTOR THE SMALLEST RATIO OF LOSS BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS REQUIRES FOR SUC CESS THE CLOSEST ATTENTION TO A GREAT MULTITUDE OF DETAILS IN THE PURCHASE OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES THE COMPANY AVOIDS THOSE WHICH REST UPON SPECULATIVE VENTURES OR EVEN UPON GOOD PROP ERTY IF IT BE OF A KIND WHICH DEPENDS TOO MUCH UPON PERSONAL MAN AGEMENT AND IF AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN FAVOR OF SUCH A PROPERTY IT IS GENERALLY BECAUSE THERE IS OFFERED AN UNUSUALLY LARGE MARGIN OF VALUE AS AN OFFSET TO THIS RISK IN LARGE CITIES WHERE REAL ESTATE IS QUICKLY SALABLE AND VALUES ARE WELL ESTABLISHED THE INVESTORS LEND AS HIGH AS 60 TO 8OPER CENT OF THE PROPERTYS VALUE HERE UNDUE COMPETITION AMONG INVESTORS REDUCES RATESMAKES THE INTEREST RETURN TOO LOWAND INCREASES LOSS BY REASON OF A DIMINISHED MARGIN I E IN THE LARGE CITIES WHERE MONEY IS MOST PLENTIFUL AND MOST URGENTLY SEEKING INVESTMENT IT SOMETIMES VERY IMPROPERLY BECOMES A QUESTION AS TO WHICH INVESTOR SHALL LEND UPON A GIVEN PROPERTY AT THE LOWEST RATE THE LARGEST SUM 262 82LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENTS OF MONEY MOST OF THE LIFE COMPANIES WISELY AVOID THIS DANGER OUS FORM OF COMPETITION IT MAY BE HERE REMARKED HOWEVER THAT THE MONEY LENDERS APPEAR TO BE ALMOST THE ONLY CAPITALISTS WHO HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED THE GOOD SENSE TO CONSULT OR COMBINE FOR THE SAKE OF SAFETY AND A SATISFACTORY INTEREST RETURN OUTSIDE OF LARGE CITIES GOVERNED BY THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE THE MORTGAGE WILL REPRESENT FROM 35 TO 60 PER CENT OF THE PROPERTYS SUPPOSED MARKET VALUE THE PERSONAL ELEMENT SHOULD ENTER LARGELY INTO CONSIDERATION OF A MORTGAGE OR ANY OTHER LOAN THE INVESTOR NATURALLY PREFERS TO LEND TO THE SUCCESSFUL MAN BECAUSE THE SUCCESSFUL MAN IS ABLE TO REPAY THE DEBT PERHAPS THIS FEATURE MAY BE BEST EXPRESSED BY GIV ING A FINANCIAL MANS JOCULAR ANSWER TO A FRIEND APPLYING FOR A LOAN UPON COLLATERAL SECURITY HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE THIS MONEY I WILL NOT LEND IT BUT IF YOU CAN THOROUGHLY CON VINCE ME THAT YOU DO NOT NEED IT I WILL LET YOU HAVE IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATIONS AS A RULE CARRY IN REAL ESTATE MORT GAGESFIRST MORTGAGESFROM 20 TO 50 PER CENT OF THEIR ENTIRE ASSETS FEW OF THE IMPORTANT COMPANIES OWN LESS THAN 20 PER CENT AND A FEWWESTERN COMPANIES CHIEFLYCARRY MORE THAN 50 PER CENT THE AGGREGATE REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES ON JANUARY I I904 BEING FIVE HUN IRED AND SEVENTYTHREE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 573262009 ABOUT 27 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL ASSETS THE WELLMANAGED LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATION INVESTING LARGELY IN MORTGAGES KEEPS IN ITS EMPLOY IN ADDITION TO AN OFFICE FORCE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF MEN OF THE HIGHEST ORDER OF ABILITY WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO EXAMINE AND PASS UPON THE MERITS OF PROPERTIES OFFERED AS SECURITY FOR MORTGAGE TO FREQUENTLY INSPECT PROPERTIES COVERED BY MORTGAGES ALREADY OWNED TO REPORT PROMPTLY ANY CHANGE OF VALUES DUE TO A CHANGE OF BUSINESS CENTERS OR TO NEGLECT OF IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS OR TO OTHER CAUSES A COMPETENT OFFICE FORCE IS NEEDED FOR THE PROMPT COLLECTION OF INTEREST TO WATCH CAREFULLY THAT SOUND FIRE INSURANCE IS FURNISHED AND RENEWED BEFORE THE DATE OF EXPIRA TION TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE PROPERTY HAS NOT BEEN SOLD FOR NONPAY MENT OF TAXES BUT ON THE CONTRARY THAT TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS FOR PAVING AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS ARE PROMPTLY PAID ON OR BEFORE THE FINAL DATE FIXED BY STATUTE THIS REQUIRES SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE VARYING TAX LAWS OF MANY DIFFERENT STATES 263 83THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN SHORT WHILE THE TAKING OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES ENTAILS A GREAT DEGREE OF CAUTION A LARGE AMOUNT OF LABOR AND AN OFFICE FORCE OF HIGH EFFICIENCY YET THE VERY FACT THAT THE SMALL INVESTOR CANNOT AFFORD THE EXPENSE OF THESE NUMEROUS PRECAUTIONS MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATION TO COLLECT AN ACCEPTABLE INTEREST RETURN THROUGH HOLDING A LARGE PROPORTION OF ITS ASSETS IN SAFE MORT GAGES UPON REAL ESTATE SECURITY AND AT THE SAME TIME TO AVOID THOSE ANNOYING FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUE WHICH ARE INSEPARABLE FROM INVESTMENTS PLACED IN OTHER CHANNELS THE FACT THAT MORTGAGES ARE NOT QUICK ASSETS IS THE CHIEF REASON FOR NOT CARRYING A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION IN THIS DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY PRECAUTIONS TAKEN IN PURCHASE OF SECURITIES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO BUY FROM LONGESTABLISHED FIRMS OF HIGHEST STANDINGMEN WHO HAVE THE ABILITY THE MEANS AND THE FACILITIES TO ASCERTAIN THE FACTS AND THE CANDOR AND INTEGRITY TO REPORT THEM ASIDE FROM THIS DURING YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION THE STUDIOUS FINANCIAL MAN ENDEAVORS GRADUALLY TO ABSORB A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE AFFAIRS OF BORROWING CORPORATIONS AND ESPECIALLY A FAMILIARITY WITH THE SUREST WAY TO FIND THE FACTS WITH MOST RAILROAD AND CORPORATION BONDS THE COST OR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AS COMPARED WITH ITS BONDED DEBT IS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL POINTS AND ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN HARDLY SECOND TO THIS ARE THE ITEMS OF GROSS EARNINGS AND OF EXPENSES OF MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION AND CONSEQUENT NET EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO INTEREST PAYMENTS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST SUSPICIOUS ITEMS IS AN ABNORMALLY SMALL EXPENSE RATIO WHILE THE CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNT REMAINS STILL OPEN AND DURING THE TIME THAT BONDS ARE BEING OFFERED ON THE MARKET WHAT IS INDUSTRIOUSLY SEARCHED FOR AND RARELY FOUND AT A FAIR PRICE IS A BOND REPRESENTING BUT A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE COST OF A PROPERTY WHICH THOUGH ADMITTING AN AMPLE EXPENSE AC COUNT IS STILL ABLE TO PRODUCE EARNINGS SUFFICIENT TO PAY EXPENSES INTEREST AND A LARGE SURPLUS FOR THE STOCK TIME DOES NOT PERMIT A RECITAL OF ALL THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN TO SEE TO THE LEGALITIES WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS PURCHASED PERHAPS IT MAY SUFFICE TO SAY THAT THERE IS EMPLOYED A FORCE OF TRAINED LAW YERS WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO ASSUME IN EACH CASE THE LABOR AND RESPONSI BILITY OF A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO PROVE EACH MORT 264 84LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENTS GAGE TO BE A FIRST INCUMBRANCE UPON A GOOD AND MARKETABLE TITLE AND EACH BOND A VALID BINDING AND LAWFULLY ISSUED OBLIGATION THIS IS THE CONCLUSION WHICH MUST BE REACHED IN EVERY CASE BEFORE PAYING OUT THE MONEY WE NOW COME TO THE FIFTH SPECIFICATION THE EXTENT OF LIFE INISURANCE INVESTMENTS I AM INDEBTED FOR MY INSURANCE FACTS TO THE COMPENDIUM OF OFFICIAL LIFE INSURANCE REPORTS FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING JANUARY I I904 THIS WAS THE PUBLICATION AT HAND AND LATER DATA WOULD HAVE ONLY CHANGED THE FIGURES WITHOUT ALTERING THEIR RELATIVE IMPOR TANCE TO BRING THESE FIGURES UP TO DATE WOULD ADD ABOUT IO PER CENT TO THE TOTALS I SHALL USE THERE ARE NINETYTWO COMPANIES MENTIONEDOF VARIOUS GRADES SEVENTYNINE OF THEM HAVING ADMITTED ASSETS OF 2055555548 IN SPEAKING I WILL DISREGARD ODD FIGURES AS CONFUSING ADMITTED ASSETS THEN OF TWO BILLIONS ASSETS NOT ADMITTED SEVEN MILLIONS 7 IIO 70I AT THIS POINT IT MAY BE WELL TO SAY THAT THE TWO BILLIONS OF ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN APPROXIMATELY THE FOLLOWING PROPORTIONS PER CENT PER CENT BONDS  40 CASH  4 M ORTGAGES  27 COLLATERAL LOANS  3 REAL ESTATE  8 OTHER INVESTMENTS  3 STOCKS  7 PREMIUM NOTES ETC  7 IOO THIS IS THE DIVISION OF THE TOTAL THE INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES HOLD DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS IT IS STATED THAT AMERICAN FARM PRODUCTS REACHED IN I904 THE HUGE TOTAL OF 4900000000 NEARLY FIVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THESE FARM PRODUCTS ARE THE OUTPUT OF A TERRITORY EXTENDING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFICTHE RESULT OF THE LABOR OF MILLIONS OF MEN THE LIFE INSURANCE ACCUMULATIONS AGGREGATE MORE THAN 40 PER CENT OF THIS VAST TOTAL HERE WE FIND A STRIKING ILLUSTRATION OF THE GREAT NESS OF THIS FUND IN ORDER THAT WE MAY FORM SOME CONCEPTION OF THIS GREAT SUM OF TWO BIFLIONS OF ADMITTED ASSETS LET ME SAY THAT EQUALLY DIVIDED IT WOULD REPRESENT OVER 25 FOR EACH MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN THIS 265 85THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY COUNTRY IT IS NEARLY THREE TIMES THE COMBINED CAPITAL OF THE 5134 NATIONAL BANKS IT IS TWOTHIRDS OF THE TOTAL OF SAVINGS BANK DEPOSITS IT GREATLY EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF OUR NATIONAL DEBT IT IS NEARLY DOUBLE THE VALUE OF THE YEARS PRODUCT OF ALL MINERALS IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS NEARLY 50 PER CENT IN EXCESS OF THE GROSS RECEIPTS OF ALL THE RAILROADS IT IS MORE THAN THE ENTIRE WORLDS PRODUCTION OF GOLD FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS IT WILL SHOW THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMPANIES IF ATTEN TION IS DIRECTED TO THE FACT THAT 99 PER CENT OF THIS GREAT FUND IS CONTROLLED BY THIRTYONE COMPANIES AND I PER CENT ONLY BY THE OTHER SIXTY COMPANIES AS PERMANENCE AND SOLVENCY ARE THE ESSENTIALS OF SUCCESS IN LIFE INSURANCE THIS CONCENTRATION OUGHT NOT TO BE HASTILY CONDEMNED AS ALTOGETHER UNDESIRABLE THE POSSESSION OF 99 PER CENT OF THE INSURANCE WEALTH SHOULD SURELY FURNISH MEANS TO ATTRACT THE HIGHER GRADE OF TALENT TO THE COMPANIES THUS STRONGLY FORTIFIED THE DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR AFFAIRS FURNISHED BY THE LIFE INSURANCE CORPORATIONS AND THE PUBLICITY GIVEN THIS DETAILED INFORMATION ARE GREATER THAN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY AFFORDS THE SUPERVISION OVER THIS INDUSTRY EXERCISED BY THE VARIOUS STATE INSUR ANCE DEPARTMENTS ISAS IT SHOULD BEMORE RIGID THAN THAT EXER CISED OVER ANY FINANCIAL COMMERCIAL OR TRANSPORTATION INTEREST THIS PUBLICITY THIS RIGID SUPERVISION THIS VETO POWER OVER THE ACTION OF THE MANAGEMENT OUGHT TO BE SUFFICIENT PROTECTION TO THE PUBLIC AGAINST ANY NOW EXISTING EVILS OF THIS CONCENTRATION AND YET THE CONTROL OF I235OOOOOO6O PER CENTOF THIS FUND BY FOUR COM PANIES IS PLACING UPON A VERY FEW MEN A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND PRESENTING TO THEM A SERIOUS PROBLEM OF THE FUTURE TO FIRMLY FIX IN MIND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS INSURANCE WEALTH LET ME RECAPITULATE THE TOTAL ON JANUARY I I904 WAS IN ROUND NUMBERS 205500000060 PER CENT HELD BY THE FOUR LARGE COM PANIES 39 PER CENT BY TWENTYSEVEN COMPANIES OF MORE MODERATE SIZE AND ONLY I PER CENT BY THE REMAINING SIXTY SMALL CONCERNS TO ATTEMPT TO EXPRESS SENTIMENT IN TERMS OF MONEY SEEMS QUES TIONABLE TASTE BUT THESE ENORMOUS ASSETS APPEAR TO LOSE THEIR MER CENARY CHARACTER WHEN WE REFLECT THAT THEY ARE GATHERED TOGETHER TO PERPETUATE THE AMERICAN HOME THAT THEY ARE A PRODUCT OF THE THRIFT THE ENERGY THE SELFDENIAL OF THE AMERICAN BREAD WINNER THAT THEY STAND IN TOKEN OF HIS STURDY STERLING CHARACTER WHILE LIV 266 86LIFE INSURANCE INVESTMENTS ING AND BECOME AN ALMOST SACRED TRIBUTE TO HIS MEMORY AFTER HE HAS GONE TAXATION THIS VAST ACCUMULATION HAS BEEN FOUND WONDERFULLY ATTRACTIVE TO THE TAX GATHERER THOSE OF US WHO ARE CONNECTED WITH PURELY MUTUAL COMPANIESCOMPANIES WHICH HAVE NO CAPITAL STOCK AND WHICH ARE NOT ORGANIZED FOR PROFITARE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY THESE MUTUAL COMPANIES SHOULD BE SO LARGELY TAXED THE MUTUAL COMPANY IS COMPOSED OF INDIVIDUALS EACH OF WHOM IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER INTERESTS MAY BE PRESUMED TO PAY HIS FULL SHARE OF NATIONAL STATE MUNICIPAL AND OTHER TAXES I DO NOT SAY THERE IS BUT THERE MAY BE SOME REASONABLE DEFENSE OF A MODERATE TAX UPON THE SMALL SPECULATIVE PORTION OF A TONTINE POLICYS ACCUMULATIONS BUT THERE IS NONE FOR TAXING THE GREAT BULK OF A MUTUAL COMPANYS ASSETS HELD FOR THE PROTECTION OF ITS INSURANCE CONTRACTS UNDER AN INTELLIGENT SYSTEM OF TAXATION THE TAX IS PLACED UPON THE PROFIT YOU DO NOT TAX A LOSS IN THE PURELY MUTUAL COMPANY THERES NO SUCH WORD AS PROFIT THE COMPANY PERFORMS ITS FUNCTION WITH NO SUCH OBJECT INSURANCE IS FURNISHED AT ITS ACTUAL COST THE THEORY WHICH UNDERLIES THE FORMATION OF A PURELY MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY IS THAT IT IS SIMPLY A MEANS FOR THE EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF AN INEVITABLE LOSS LET US SUPPOSE A COMBINATION OF TEN ONE HUNDRED OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MENTHE NUMBER HAS NO SIGNIFICANCE EXCEPT TO PRODUCE AN AVERAGELET US SUPPOSE EACH OF THESE MEN AGREES TO PAY A CERTAIN SUM FOR THE RELIEF OF THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO DIETO RESTORE TO EACH FAMILY THAT OF WHICH IT HAS BEEN DEPRIVED THE INSURABLE VALUE OF ITS DEPARTED HEAD ELABORATE IT COMPLICATE IT WITH VARIED FORMS OF POLICIES SAFEGUARD IT WITH ACTUARIAL TABLES AS YOU WILL AND STILL THE BASIC FACT REMAINS BEYOND DISPUTE THAT EACH MEMBER OF A MUTUAL COMPANY BY PAYMENT OF HIS PRNEMIUM MERELY CONTRIBUTES THAT SUM WHICH REPRESENTS HIS SHARE OF LOSS TAXATION OF THIS IS SO MUCH ADDED TO THE LOSS OR SO MUCH SUBTRACTED FROM THE INSURANCE BENEFIT IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE JUSTICE THE WISDOM OR EVEN THE EXPEDIENCY OF PUTTING A TAX UPON A LOSS AND THUS ADDING TO ITS BURDEN 267 8788 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WHATEVER THE ORIGINAL INTENT THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF THE FOR MATION OF A MUTUAL COMPANY IS TO PREVENT THE FAMILIES OF ITS MEM BERS FROM BECOMING A CHARGE UPON THE PUBLIC EVERY DOLLAR OF TAX UPON A MUTUAL COMPANY THEREFORE ANTAGONIZES PUBLIC WELFARE IN SO FAR AS IT TENDS TOWARD THE DEFEAT OF THIS BENEFICENT RESULT

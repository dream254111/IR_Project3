j100000,Science,1636552,The Boston Meeting of the American Association,i296105,N S VOL XXX No 782 rapidly increasing number of students taking mining engineering work it has been neces sary to add two wings to the School of Mines building and to employ additional assistance Certain laboratories will be set aside for the experimental and research work on gas coal clays building materials cements etc and for this work the laboratories will be among the very best equipped in America This work is unquestionably of very great impor tance to the state The research which has already been car ried on in the AMining Engineering College of the State University relative to lignite coal gas and clays has attracted the attention of many men throughout the country who are interested in these subjects It is intended to build up laboratories and carry on investiga tions which will be a help to the state The work which will be taken up most vig orously during the coming year will be for the purpose of obtaining by investigations and practical tests a cheap and commercially satisfactory method of lignite coal briquetting to show the best methods of burning lignite and to determine the possibility of utilizing lignite for producing gas for light heat and power Considerable attention will be given also to the utilization of the high grade clays of the state for the manufacture of a variety of wares In order to carry on this work on a practical commercial basis considerable machinery of special design will be installed at the substation at Hebron For several months work has been devoted to machinery and methods which seemed to be suited to the manufacture of briquettes from lignite As a result complete briquetting plant has been designed and is now being built The press will have a capac ity of 2 tons of briquettes per hour In ad dition to this a specially constructed gas plant is being made for the purpose of manu facturing gas for light heat and power from lignite coal This will be one of the most perfect types of gas plants and large enough to produce several thousand cubic feet per day Machinery and kilns of commercial working size will be installed later for prac tical testing of the higher grade clays THE ELIZABETH THOMPSON SCIENCE FUND IN January 1910 there will be a meeting of the trustees of the Elizabeth Thompson Sci ence Fund for the award of grants Applica tions in order to be considered at that time should reach the secretary Dr C S Minot Harvard Medical School Boston before Jan uary 15 1910 All applications must be ac companied by full information especially in regard to the following points 1 Precise amount required 2 Exact nature of the investigation pro posed 3 Conditions under which the research is to be prosecuted 4 Manner in which the appropriation asked for is to be expended The trustees are disinclined for the present to make any grant to meet ordinary expenses of living or to purchase instruments such as are found commonly in laboratories De cided preference will be given to applications for small amounts and grants exceeding 300 will be made only under very exceptional cir cumstances Preference will be given to those investigations which can not otherwise be provided for THE BOSTON MEETING OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION THE hotel headquarters for physicists at the Boston meeting of the American Association

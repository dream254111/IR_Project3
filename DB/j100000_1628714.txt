ternational Exposition Paris 1900 the jury having in charge Group III Class 15 Instruments of Precision Moneys and Medals were very much impressed with the German exhibit This exhibit was arranged in a different way from that used by any other nation Germany made a joint ex hibition of mechanicians and opticians and arranged their apparatus in sections em bracing certain classes of instruments and thus departed from the usual custom of arranging the exhibits under various firms This enabled the jury to see at once all in struments of the same kind grouped to gether in one case The German Association printed com plete catalogues describing and illustrating the apparatus exhibited and these cata logues and descriptions were of very great assistance to the jurors in making awards The catalogues printed an introduction which gave in a very condensed form the history of the work done in Germany in improving the manufacture of instruments of precision I enclose an English transla tion of this introduction furnished by the German Association and suggest that it be published in full in SCIENCE inasmuch as it shows by what methods the German mechanicians have been able to produce such splendid results J K REES Member of the Jury Group III Class 15N S VOL XII No 308 For the series here described the American Museum and Mr Jesup the Maecenas of American ethnology deserve hearty praise It is now in order for others of our great museums to wake up and let us hear from them 0 T MAsoN BOOKS RECEIVED Geometrical Optics R A HERMAN Cambridge University Press New York The Macmillan

picture of the late president of the Society the Hon Charles P Daly which forms the frontis piece of this number Judge Daly was the honored president of this the oldest Geograph ical Society in America and the portrait painted by Harper Pennington forms a fitting memorial of the thirtyfive years of active service to the Society The number contains a larger series than usual of what might be called new articles First among these is an article upon the  Ethnol ogy of Madagascar by the Hon W H Hunt of Tamatave dealing largely with the tribal names and the early immigrations showing that there must have been a series of migrations from an Asiatic source The second section of the paper discusses the early maps of the island and then takes up the geography and cartography of Madagasgcar as developed between 1897 and 1899 This new work is due largely to the initiative of General Gallieni This is followed by an article descriptive of the Heaths and Hollows of Holland by Dr W E Griffiths a bright and entertaining tale of this water logged  country and its people  Koreas Geo graphical Significance is discussed by H B Hulbert of Seoul in a scholarly paper showing the relations brought about by this stepping stone from Asia to Japan giving the results produced as a link between two widely separated branches of the Turanian stock and then again when serving as a barrier between active Japan and ambitious Russia Mr Henry Gannett of Washington gives a careful rgsumg of the recent census of Porto Rico This new addition to our domain has a population of 963243 thus showing a very dense population of its 3600 square miles An outline sketch of the geogra phy of British Honduras is given by Hon W L Avery of Belize This is followed by an account of a trip through the silk and tea dis tricts of Kiangnan and Chepiang by E S Fischer The portion of the Bulletin devoted to notes in this number is particularly full and covers the departments of physiography map notices climatology geographical edu cation and the general geographical record Cosmos Mindeleff gives a full account of the use and manufacture of geographical relief maps and M Henri Froideveaux gives a sketch of geography at the Paris Exposition At the end of the number there is a picture of the new home of the Society Manhattan Square on 81st street giving a view of the front of the building and plans of the grounds and library floors The enterprise of the Council in constructing this building as a repository for its fine library and a commodious place for the intercourse of the Fellows of the Society is deserving of the highest praise The Plant World for October opens with Notes for the Beginner in the Study of Mosses by F H Knowlton the first of a series on the lower plants A S Hitchcock describes  Col lecting Sets of Plants for Exchange E J Hill has  An Observation on the WaterShield Brasenia peltata dealing with the dissemina tion of its seed Charles Newton Gould de scribes the  Radiate Structure of the Wild Gourd Curcubita faetidissima and Joseph Crawford has some Notes on Ophioglossum In the supplement devoted to  The Families of Flowering Plants Charles Louis Pollard deals 806 SCIENCENOVEMBER 23 1900 with the orders Verticellatse Piperales Sali cales and Juglandes and their allies THE Journal of the Boston Society of Medical Sciences for October begins with a discussion of The Antitoxin Unit in Diphtheria by Theo bald Smith detailing various experiments made and concludinig that at present we cannot do better than to utilize the standard provided by Ehrlich which is described in the paper John Lovett Morse has an abstract of a paper on The Serum Reaction in Fcetal and Infantile Typhoid and Albert P Matthews describes Artificially produced Mitotic Division in Un fertilized Arbacia Eggs caused by lack of oxygen heat and the action of alcohol chloro form and ether Martin H Fischer has a pre liminary communication on  The Toxic Effects of Formaldehyde and Formalin and William Sydney Thayer has some Observations on the Blood in Typhoid Fever being an analysis of the examinations of the blood in typhoid fever made in the Johns Hopkins Hospital during eleven years SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON THE 327th regular meeting was held on Sat urday evening November 3d Under the head of Notes F A Lucas de scribed a specimen of the buffalofish recently received by the U S National Museum which had no mouth the bones of the jaws having failed to develop The fish must have fed by means of the gill openings and had attained a weight of more than a pound when caught W H Dall called attention to the discovery by Mr T Wayland Vaughan of a fossil coral reef in Decatur Co Georgia This reef which was of Oligocene age resembled the fossil reefs in the Island of Antigua and was noteworthy from the large number of species represented the reefs of the Tertiary beds usually being poor in the number of species of corals Under the title Insects affecting Cotton L 0 Howard following the symposium on cotton which occupied the last meeting of the Society made some observations on the princi pal insect enemies of the plant He presented accounts of Aletia xylina Heliothis armiger Dys dercus suturellus and Anthonomus grandis noting various outbreaks of these pests and describing their habits transformations and the remedies employed Henry James spoke of Recent Progress in Forestry saying that the great obstacles to improvement in the management of forests in America were first from the point of view of a forester the new trees and conditions which have made the application of European methods in this country impossible and second the al most total lack of examples of successful forest management During the last two years however this con dition of things has greatly improved The offer of the Division of Forestry through the Department of Agriculture to examine forest tracts and prepare working plans for their management free of charge has been taken ad vantage of on every side and it has thus been made possible for the division to give object lessons in forest management in many parts of the country and to gain knowledge and ex perience in a most practical way In New York for instance a working plan is now being prepared for a part of the State Forest Pre serve in the Adirondacks On the Pacific coast the day of conservative lumbering is being brought nearer by investigations of the habits of growth and reproduction of some important lumber trees These are making it clear among other things that the Red Fir and the Redwood reproduce more easily and will grow to a merchantable size much sooner than has hitherto been supposed Similar observa tions are being made in other parts of the country and interest in forestry is everywhere spreading rapidly This is partly because peo ple are realizing the importance of ample forest resources and a steady supply of water partly because foresters can more often get down to terms which appeal to practical landowners It means that soon many States will be follow ing the example of Indiana Pennsylvania and one or two others in taking hold in earnest of such important problems as those relating to protection from fire and reform in forest taxa tion Forestry is appearing daily as something practical and desirable to more and more own ers of forest land and voters generally who shape legislation SCIENCE 807

J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1005265,MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL JULIAN AND GREGORIAN,I241970,ARTICLE V MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENIDAR CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL JULIAN AND GREGORIAN BY WILLIAMN MCILVAINE READ AUGUST 15 1845 WHEN MY ATTENTION AT SCHOOL WAS FIRST TURNED TO THE SOLUTION OF CHRONOLOGICAL PROBLEMS I RECEIVED A STRONG IMPRESSION THAT THE DOMINICAL LETTERS FORMED TOO COMPLEX AND CUM BROUS AN APPENDAGE OF THE CALENDAR ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN IN PIKES ARITH METIC AT THAT TIME A STANDARD ELEMENTARY WORK ONE OF THE FIRST SEVEN LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET IN REGULAR ORDER A ALWAYS STANDING AT THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY MUST BE PRE FIXED TO EVERY DAY IN THE COMMON YEAR OF 365 DAYS THE LETTER WHICH IN THIS SERIES HAPPENED TO BE AFFIXED TO THE FIRST SUNDAY IN JANUARY WAS CALLED THE DOMINICAL LETTER OF THAT YEAR AS MARKING ALL ITS SUNDAYS BUT IN LEAP YEARS THE NEXT FOLLOWING LETTER WAS TO SERVE AS THE DOMINICAL LETTER FOR THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE YEAR A B C D E F G WITH 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SUBJOINED CONSTITUTED A TABLE THE NUMBERS BEING AN INDEX TO THE LETTERS BY A RULE WHOSE PRINCIPLE WAS LEFT UNEXPLAINED THE SUM OF THE JULIAN YEAR ITS FOURTH PART AND FOUR WAS TO BE DIVIDED BY SEVEN IF NO REMAINDER OCCURRED G WAS THE DOMINICAL LETTER BUT IF ANY NUMBER REMAINED THAT NUMBER OF LETTERS BEGINNING THE REC KONING WITH F WAS TO BE COUNTED IN A RETROGRADE ORDER FROM G TO REACH THE DOMINICAL LETTER OR ON DEDUCTING THE REMAINDER FROM SEVEN YOU MIGHT OBTAIN THE INDEX OF THE DOMINICAL LETTER COUNTING FORWARDS FROM A THE RULE WAS SHORTER FOR GREGORIAN YEARS BUT IN BOTH STYLES THE SUNDAY LETTER WAS DOUBLE IN EVERY LEAP YEAR AND AFTER THE PROPER LETTER HAD BEEN FOUND IT WAS REQUIRED TO COUNT BACKWARDS AGAIN IN ORDER TO KNOW ON WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK THE FIRST OF JANUARY HAPPENED FINALLY IF THE DAY OF THE WEEK CORRESPONDING WITH A GIVEN DAY OF ANY OTHER MONTH WAS WANTED THE TEDIOUS PROCESS OF ADDING THE DAY OF THE MNONTH TO THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN ALL THE PRECEDING MONTHS AND DIVIDING THE SUM BY SEVEN MUST BE GONE THROUGH AND THE ANSWER DEDUCED FROM ANOTHER REMAINDER104 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW IERPETUAL CALENDAR THE WHOLE SYSTEM SEEMED TO ME  CYCLE AND EPICYCLE ORB IN ORB THE WEEK APPEARING TO REVOLVE ABOUT THE LETTER A AND THE YEAR AROUND THE WEEK I HAD IMAGINED THE STRUCTURE OF THE JULIAN YEAR WHEN ONCE DIVESTED OF THE ABSURDITY OF CALENDS NONES AND IDES ALL COUNTED BACKWARDS AND AFTER HAVING THE WEEK INTRODUCED TO BE ESSENTIALLY SIMPLE AND ALTHOUGH THE DOMINICAL LETTERS FOR AGES CONSECRATED TO CLERICAL USE HAD I KNEW BEEN ADOPTED BY THE ABLEST ASTRONOMERS AND CHRONOLOGISTS OF MODERN TIMNES AND WERE STILL EMPLOYED CONJOINTLY WITH THE GOLDEN NUMBER BY LEARNED JUDGES OF THE KINGS BENCH IN ENGLAND FOR ASCERTAINING THE LEGAL PERIODS OF THE FOUR TERMS OF COURT YET I COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT SOME LESS CIRCUITOUS METHOD WOULD SOONER OR LATER SUPERSEDE AN APPARATUS WHICH HOWEVER TRUE IN ITS RESULTS AND HOWEVER LUCID IN COMPARISON WITH SOME OTHER PARTS OF THE MACHINERY CAUSES MOST PERSONS FROM ITS CORMPLEXITY ALONE TO CONSIDER EVEN THE CIVIL CALENDAR A SUBJECT OF MUCH DIFFICULTY AND THAAT OF THE CHURCH AS AN IMPENETRABLE MYSTERY I HAVE ACCORDINGLY ALWAYS LOOKED WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST AT THE PERPETUAL ALMANACS SO CALLED BUT SERVING ONLY FOR A SINGLE CENTURY WHICH HAVE SINCE FALLEN IN MY WAY WITH A VAGUE HOPE OF BEING ABLE TO DISCOVER IN THEM THE GERM OF SOME SIMPLER MODE OF COMPUTATION ON CONSULTING ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THE SEVENTH EDITION OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITAN NICA I MET ACCIDENTALLY WITH A NEW WELLDIGESTED AND PERSPICUOUS ARTICLE ON THE  CALEN DAR FROM THE PEN OF RRHOMAS GALLOWAY ESQ F R S ONE OF THE VICEPRESIDENTS OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY AND WAS GRATIFIED AT LEARNING FROM IT LHOW MUCH HAD BEELN DONE WITHIN THE PRESENT HALFCENTURY BY THE ANALYTICAL SKILL OF GAUSS AND DELAMBRE TOWARDS DISENCUMBERING THE CALENDAR OF NUMEROUS TABLES AND SUBSTITUTING FOR THEM PLAINER FORMULA I PERCEIVED HOWEVER AND NOT WITHOUT DISAPPOINTMIENT THAT THE DOMINICAL LET TERS WERE STILL RETAINED AMONG THE ELEMENTS OF THE ALGEBRAICAL EQUATIONS AND ON APPLYING THEM ARITHMETICALLY I FOUND MY COMPUTATION EMBARRASSED AT THE OUTSET BY THE QUANTITY 7RN JOINED WITH MANY QUANTITIES DIFFERING IN SIGN CONTAINED IN THE FIRST EQUATION AND AT THE CLOSE BY ANOTHER INCONVENIENT EQUATION P  P  L  1 INVOLVING THE VALUE NOT ONLY OF THE SUNDAY LETTER BUT OF A LETTER BELONGING TO THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE CALENDAR MOON AFTER A CAREFUL REPERUSAL OF MR GALLOWAYS ESSAY I WAS STRUCK WITH THE FACT TO WHICLH I HAD NEVER BEFORE ADVERTED THAT THE FIRST YEAR OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA BEGANR WITH SATURDAY WHICH BEING THE SEVENTH DAY OF THE WEEK AND CORRESPONDING WITH SEVEN THE NUMBER OF THE HEBDOMADAL CYCLE SUGGESTED TO ME THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING THAT NUMBER A CONVENIENT STARTINGPOINT OF AN INDEFINITELY PROLONGED SUCCESSION OF AGES OR CHRONOLOGICAL PERIODS ILL WHICH THE ORDINAL NUMBERS APPROPRIATE TO THE OTHER SIX DAYS OF THE WEEK MIGHT PERFORM IN A DIRECT AND MORE NATURAL AND INTELLIGIBLE MANNER THE SAME FUNCTION THAT THE DOMINICAL LETTERS IN A REVERSED ORDER AND IN CONNEXION WITH THE SOLAR CYCLE HAD HERETOFORE DONE PURSUING AS THE AMUSEMENT OF MANY LEISURE HOURS THIS CASUAL THOUGHT I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN CONSTRUCTING WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE A NTEW INSTRUMENT OF PLAIN MATERIALS BUT RATHER BET TER ADAPTED THAN THE OLD FOR ORDINARY POPULAR USE AND PERHAPS OF A LABOURSAVING CHA RACTER EVEN IN THE LHANDS OF THE LEARNED ALTHOUGH TO THIS LAST CONSIDERATIONI I WISH TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS NOT ATTACHING MUCH IMPORTANICE BUT MERELY AS ASKING THE OPINION OF MATHEMATICIANS IN REGARDL TO THE JLAIL IT AT FIRST BLUSH THEYR SHOULD 10CM IT AT ALL WORTHLY OFMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 105 THEIR SCRUTINY TO THEM A DIFFERENCE OF  METHODS TECHNICALLY SO CALLED BEING FOR THE MOST PART OF LITTLE CQNSEQUENCE MY PROPOSAL TO FREE THE CIVIL CALENDAR FROM ALGEBRAIC FORMULE WLHICH ARE APT TO CONVEY TO THEIR MINDS THE BEST EVIDENCE AND GUIDANCE MAY AT FIRST SOUND STRANGELY BUT THE ATTEMPT WILL POSSIBLY APPEAR TO THEM UPON REFLECTION QUITE CONSONANT WITH THE IMPROVED SPIRIT OF THE PRESENT AGE WHICH BRINGS WHENEVER PRAC TICABLE THINGS OF COMMON CONCERN AND USE TO COMMON COMNPREHENSION IN REGARD TO THE CHURCH CALENDAR INDEED WHICH DELAMBRE DECLARES TO BE  EXCESSIVEMENT COMPLIQUE ET QUI POUR ETRE BIEN COMPRIS EXIGE LATTENTION LA PLUS SOUTENUE I MUST ADMIT IT TO BE DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN ANY SHAPE YET ASSUMED IT IS LIKELY TO BECOME AN INVITING OR FRUITFUL OBJECT OF INQUIRY TO THE GENERALITY OF PERSONS THE NEXT PAGE EXHIBITS AND THE SUCCEEDING ONE EXEMPLIFIES MY PLAN THE CONSTITUENT PARTS OF WHICH ARE EMBODIED IN A SINGLE TABLET OR PERPETUAL CALENDAR HAVING ITS PECU LIARITIES SPECIFIED IN THE TITLE IN ADDITION TO THE TWO GENERAL RULES IT WILL BE SEEN TO CON SIST PRINCIPALLY OF A CENTRAL COLUMN HEADED ERAS WHICH SERVES AS AN INDEX TO TWO SERIES OF CORRECTIONS CALLED IN COMPLIANCE WITH CUSTOMARY FICTIONS AND NOMNENCLATURE THE SOLAR AND LUNISOLAR EQUATIONS THESE ARE COMPRISED IN TWO SIDE COLUMNS OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE CENTRAL ONE AND ACCOMPANYING IT COLUMN A BEING APPROPRIATED TO CIVIL AND COLUMN C TO ECCLESIASTICAL PURPOSES THE JULIAN ERA THOUGH EMPLOYED BY ASTRONOMERS AS A CONVENIENT UNIVERSAL MEASURE OF TIMNE IS HERE LIMITED TO YEARS AFTER CHRIST BUT EMBRACES OF COURSE ALL THOSE YEARS WHICH PRECEDE THE ADOPTION OF THE REFORMED CALENDAR AT VARIOUS EPOCHS BY THE SEVERAL NATIONS OF CHRISTENDOM THAT IS TO SAY THE EQUATIONS 5 AND 0 RESPECTIVELY STANDING AT THE HEAD OF THE SIDE COLUMNS AND  BESIDE THE ERA DENOMINATED JULIAN AFTER CHRIST ARE IN TENDED TO BE USED CONSTANTLY UNTIL SUCH A REFORMATION HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE THE ERA DENOMINATED  GREGORIAN FROM 1582 IS DIVIDED INTO CENTURIAL FIGURES BUT THE EQUATIONS STANDING BESIDE THESE SUBDIVISIONS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE APPLIED TO THE INTERVAL FOR EXAMPLE OF NEARLY 170 YEARS WHICH OCCURRED BETWEEN THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW STYLE AT ROME AND IN GREAT BRITAIN WITHOUT THIS PRELIMLINARY CAUITION THE WORD  ERAS AS EMPLOYED IN THE TABLET MIGHT POSSIBLY MISLEAD SOME READERS THE ASTERISKS ANNEXED TO THE CENTURIAL FIGURES ARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE USE OF THE TABLET BUT ARE RETAINED FOR THE PURPOSE OF BETTER ELUCIDATING ITS STRUCTURE THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THEM ON THE CIVIL SIDE MAKE KNOWN HOWEVER AT ONCE THROUGH THE EYE THOSE CENTESIMAL YEARS WHICH IN NEW STYLE ARE NOT BISSEXTILE AND THEY FURNISH ALSO A READY MEANS OF AS CERTAINING THE WHOLE NUMBER OF DAYS BY WHICH AT ANY PERIOD AFTER 1600 THE TWO STYLES DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER FOR INSTANCE IN YEARS HAVING THE CENTURIAL FIGURES 26 THE DIFFER ENCE

PERFORMED BY IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANY INTERMEDIATE ORDINAL DAY OF THOSE YEARS OR WITH ANY OTHER OLD STYLE YEAR WITHOUT LIMIITATION BUT THUS FAR WE HAVE NOT CONSIDERED THE YEAR AS DIVIDED INTO MONTHS

RULE BE FOUND TO HAPPEN ON MONDAY NOW THE SERIES OF DAYS OF THE WEEK WAS NOT INTERRUPTED NOR INTENDED TO BE BY THE REFORM THE DAYS OF THE MONTH ONLY WERE TO BE DIFFERENTLY NAMED AFTER 10 OF THEM SHOULD BE EXPUNGED THE EPOCLH DAY OR POINT OF TIME CALLED IN THE JULIAN CALENDAR THE 5TH OF OCTOBER MUST CONTINUE TO BE FRIDAY IN THE GREGORIAN AND BE RE FERRED TO AS THE 6TH DAY OF THE WEEK WHATEVER NEW DENOMINATION IT MIGHT RECEIVE AS A DAY OF THE MONTH IN ORDER THEN TO MAKE THE 15TH OF OCTOBER IN THE NEW STYLE CORRE SPOND WITH FRIDAY IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE MUST GO BACK THREE DAYS IN THE CALCULATION OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT FROM THE JULIAN SOLAR OR RATHER HEBDOMADAL EQUATION OF   MUST BE DEDUCTED THE EXCESS OVER A FULL WEEK OF THE 10 DAYS LOST OR AND THAT THENCEFORWARD DURINGR A CERTAIN PERIOD THE GREGORIAN SOLAR CORRECTION OR EQUATION MUST BE WHICH NUMBER STANDS OPPOSITE IN COLUMN A TO THE FIRST CENTURIAL FIGURES NAMELY TO 15 AND 16 THIS EQUATION 2 WOULD FOR EVER PERFORM THE SAME OFFICE IN THE GREGORIAN THAT 5 HAD DONE AND STILL DOES IN THE JULIAN CALENDAR BUT FOR A SECOND STEP TAKEN AT THE REFORNMATION WITH A VIEW TO PREVENT IN FUTURE THAT DEVIATION OF THE NOMINAL CIVIL DAYS FROMN THE DEFI NITE SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHICH HAD ARISEN FROM INTRODUCING TOO MANY LEAP YEARS IT WAS THEN DETERMINED THLAT AFTER 1600 WHICH CONTINUED HISSEXTILE IN BOTHL CALENDARS EVERY SUE112 MEMOIR

ATTACHED WOULD BE THE EQUATION REQUIRED WHICH MAY LIKEWISE BE OBTAINED WITHOUT THE USE OF TABLES BY A SHORT RULE GIVEN HEREAFTER NEAR THE CLOSE OF THE MNEMOIR I PROCEED TO EXPLAIN AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL SIDE OF THE CALENDAR AND THE MEANS I ADOPTED SOON AFTER THE CIVIL SIDE HAD BEEN COMPLETED OF CONNECTING THEM WITH EACH OTHER THUS MAKING TWO OF THE MONTHLY NUMBERS IN TABLE B NAMELY 3 AND 6 STILL REPRESENTING MARCH AND APRIL CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS SHORTENINIG THE CALCULATIONS RESPECTING EASTER AND CAUSING ALSO A SINGLE ADDITIONAL COLUMN C TO SERVE AS A CONVENIENT SUBSTITUTE FOR AN EXTENDED TABLE OF THIRTY LINES OF EPACTS INDEXED WVITH AS MANY ALPLHABETICAL LETTERS GREAT AND SMALL AND CONSISTING OF NINETEEN NUMBERS IN EACL LINE AIDED BY MR GALLOWAYS ARTICLE BEFORE REFERRED TO AND BY ONE OF LORD MACCLESFIELDS PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF 1750 NO 494 PAGE 417 I FOURLD TLLE TASK LESS DIFFICULT THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED THEY DESCRIBE THE INGENIOUS BUT INVOLVED AND INTRICATE MODE OF EXPRESSING IN THE CHURCH CALENDAR SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOLAR AND LTUNAR YEARS BY MEARNS OF EPACTS OR INEREMNENTS THESE EPACTS ARE SO DERIVED FRONM THE GOLDEN NUMBERS THAT IS FROMN THE ORDER IN WHICH THE YEARS STANLD IN THE METONIC CYCLE OF 19 YEARS AS TO INDICATE THE AGE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR OF AN IMAGINARY RNOON WHOSE ARTIFICIAL PHASES THOUGH APPROACHING SELDOM CORRESPOND WITH BUT ARE GENLERALLY A DAY OR TWO IN ADVANCE OF THE MEAN MOVEMENTS OF THE TRUE MOON THEY STATE THAT SUPPOSING THE EPACT OF THE YEAR 1 TO BE 11 THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEENI THE COMMON SOLAR YEAR OF 365 DAYS AND THE LUNAR YEAR OF 354 DAYS THE EPACT OF EACH FOLLOWING YEAR OF THE FIRST CYCLE OF 19 IS OBTAINED BY ADDING 11 TO THAT OF THE FORMER YEAR AND BY REJECTING 30 AS OFTEN AS THE SUIM EXCEEDS 30 BUT THAT AT THE 20TH 39TH 58TH 77TLL C YEARS VIZ AT THE BEGINNINGS OF EACH SUCCEEDING CYCLE 12 IS TO BE ADDED TO THE EPACT OF THE LAST YEAR OF EACH PRECEDING CYCLE AND CONTINUED AUGMENTATIONS OF 11 AND REJECTIONS OF 30 ARE TO TAKE PLACE AS BEFORE HENCE I INFERRED THAT THE GOLDEN NUMBERS AS REMNAIN DERS ON DIVISION BY 19 OF THE YEAR PLUS 1 MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH ANID THEIR PLACE IN CONMPUTATION BE CONVENIENTLY SUPPLIED BY ADDING TO 11 TIMES TLLE YEAR THE 19TH PART OF THE YEAR USED AS A QUOTIENT OR WHOLE NUMBER TAKING CARE ONLY THAT WHEN THE JULIAN YEAR HIAPPENS TO BE A NMULTIPLE OF 19 ONE LESS THAN THE 19TH PARE SHALL BE ADDED THIS EASY FORMULA YIELDED ME WITHOUT A FAILURE THE CONSTANITLY RECURRING 19 EPACTS THAT MARK THE ANCIENT CALENDAR BEGINNING WITH 11 AND ENDING THEIR ROUND WITH 29 AND THE GENERAL RULE AT THE HEAD OF MY TABLET AS THERE MODIFIED IS PRECISELY AN EQUIVALENT FOR IT BUT PROVIDES AT THE SAME TIME A PRACTICAL ADVANTAGE IN THE ARRANGEMIENT OF THE FIGURES THE OMISSION OF FRACTIONS ADVANCES BY 1 IN THE ORDER PRESCRIBED EACH SUCCESSIVE SET OR CYCLE OF EPACTS WHILE THE EXCEPTION STATED GUARDS EFFECTUALLY AGAINST THE INTERCALATION OF 1 TAKING PLACE AT ANY EARLIER DATE THAN THE PROPER CYCLE JUST AS IN THE CIVIL CALENDAR 1 LESS THAN ONE4TH PART OF THE YEAR IS ADDED IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF LEAP YEARS THE REASON VOL X 29114 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR IS THE SAME ALSO FOR OMITTING THE FRACTIONS OCCURRING BETWEEN MULTIPLES OF 19 IN THE CHURCH CALENDAR AS THOSE OCCURRING BETWEEN MULTIPLES OF 4 IN THE CIVIL WITH A VIEW TO DEMONSTRATE WITHOUT A LARGE ARRAY OF FIGURES THE CONSISTENCY OF MLY RULE WITH WELLESTABLISHED TABULAR MODES OF FINDING THE EPACT I REFER TO THE EXTENDED TABLE OF EPACTS IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA ARTICLE  CALENDAR PAGE 12 WHERE IN LINE C BEGINNING WITH 11 WILL BE FOUND ALL THE JULIAN EPACTS UNDER A GOLDEN NUMBER HOW EVER ALWAYS ONE BEHIND OR ONE LESS THAN THAT WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED TO THE YEAR A D 1 WAS IN THE OLD CALENDAR ALWAYS REGARDED AS YEAR 2 OF THE CYCLE OF 19 RRHIS RELATION BETWEEN THE GOLDEN NUMBERS AND THE EPACTS WAS CHANGED AT THE REFORMATION WHEN THE LINE D BEGINNING WITH 1 WAS SELECTED FOR THE GREGORIAN EPACTS BETWEEN THE YEARS 1582 AND 1699 INCLUSIVE AND THE         EPACTS 1 12 23 4 C WERE MADE TO CORRESPOND WITHL THE GOLDEN NUMBERS     1 2 3 4 C THE JULIAN EPACT FOR 1582 FOUND BY MY RULE AND CONFIRMED BY THE ELABORATE CHRONO LOGICAL TABLE CONTAINED IN  THE ART OF VERIFYING DATES A WORK OF GREAT LEARNING AND ACKNOWLEDGED AUTHORITY IS 25 THE SAME THAT IS PRESENTED IN THE LINE C OF THIE EXTENDED TABLE OF EPACTS UNDER THE GOLDEN NUMBER 5 THAT OF THE JULIAN YEAR BEING 6 DE SCENDING TEN PLACES IN THAT COLUMN ON ACCOUNT OF THE TEN DAYS SUPPRESSED AT THE REFORM OR WHAT COMES TO THE SAME THING DEDUCTING FROM THE JULIAN EPACT OF 25 THE NUMBER OF DAYS SUPPRESSED OR    10 WE REACH OR OBTAIN  15 BUT THE ADVANCE OF ONE GOLDEN NUMBER IN THE LINE D IS EQUIVALENT TO THE ADDITION OF 11 AND THUS CAUSES THE GREGORIAN EPACT FOR 1582 TO BE           26 FOR 1583 TO BE 7 FOR 1584 TO BE 18 AND SO ON THAT IS TO SAY MAKES IT ALWAYS GREATER BY 1 THAN THE JULIAN UNTIL 1700 UNLESS THE YEARS BE MULTIPLES OF 19 IN WHICH CASE THE JULIAN EPACT AS THE EXCEPTION PROVIDES WILL BECOME ALWAYS 29 AND THE GREGORIAN WILL BE 1 THE 15 IN THE TRANSITION FROM ONE STYLE TO THE OTHER IS NOT AN EPACT OF THE YEAR IN EITHER BUT A CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE TWO THE GREGORIAN EPACT AT THAT EPOCH IS IN REALITY GREATER BY A UNIT THAN THE JULIAN AND THE JULIAN EQUATION STANDING AT THE HEAD OF COLUMN C IN MY TABLET BEING 0 FOR EVER THE PROPER STARTINGPOINT FOR THE GRE GORIAN EQUATIONS IS 1 WHICH NUMBER ACCORDINGLY STANDS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE CENTURIAL FIGURES 15 AND 16 THE SUCCEEDING LUNISOLAR EQUATIONS 0 29 28 C WERE REACHED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER LORD MACCLESFIELDS DIRECTIONS FOR DETERMINING  IN WHAT YEARS THE EPACTS SHOULD EITHER BE EXTRAORDIINARILY AUGMENTED OR DIMINISHED AND THE GOLDEN NUMBERS SHOULD EITHER BE SET BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS IN THE CALENDAR ACCORDING TO THE DIVISIBILITY OF THE EVEN HUN DREDS BY 3 OR BY 4 SEPARATELY OR BY BOTH 3 AND 4 OR BY NEITHER LED ME TO THE EXPEDIENT SIMILAR TO THE ONE I HAD ALREADY ADOPTED IN REGARD TO THE SECULAR EQUATIONS IN THE CIVIL CALENDAR OF MARKING WITH AN ASTERISK IN STRICT OBEDIENCE TO THE GREGORIAN LAW EVERY CENTURIAL FIGURE AT WHICH IN SUCCESSIVE PERIODS OF 25 CENTURIES BEGINNING AT 1800 4300 6800 C THE EPACT IS TO BE INCREASED BY A UNIT THIS CORRECTION OCCURS AT THE END OF EVERY 300 YEARS 7 TIMES IN SUCCESSION AND THEN ONCE AT THE END OF 400 YEARS MAKING 8 CORRECTIONS IN THE COURSE OF 2500 YEARSMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 115 THE MERE RELATIVE POSITION OF THESE RIGHTHAND ASTERISKS TO THOSE ALREADY PLACED ON THE LEFT SERVES TO ASCERTAIN WITHOUT CALCULATION THE COINCIDENCE OR OTHERWISE OF THE PRESCRIBED SECULAR ADJUSTMENTS AND TO INDICATE AT ONCE BY A PROCESS RATHER MORE DIRECT AND SIMPLE THAN LORD MACCLESFIELDS THE JOINT EFFECT UPON THE CALENDAR MOONS AGE OF THE OMISSION THREE TIMES IN EVERY 400 YEARS OF A 29TH OF FEBRUARY ON THE ONE HAND AND OF THE ADDITION EIGHT TIMES IN EVERY 2500 YEARS OF AN EXTRAEPACT ON THE OTHER FOR IT IS OBVIOUS WITH REFERENCE TO THE NORMAL BISSEXTILE INTERCALATION OF THE JULIAN CALENDAR AND TO ITS RECURRING EPACTS WHICH DEPEND UPON THE GOLDEN NOS AND ARE THROUGH THEM CONNECTED WITH THE GREGORIAN EPACTS BY A DEFINITE LAW BOTH OF ANALOGY AND DEVIATION THAT ON THE LEFT AN ASTERISK MEANS DEDUCT NOTHING A BLANK MEANS DEDUCT ONE DAY AND THAT ON THE RIGHT AN ASTERISK MEANS ADD ONE DAY A BLANK MEANS ADD NOTHING NOW HAVINGR AT THE CENT FIGS 15 AND L6AS AFIXED POINT OF DEPARTURE THEEQUATIONLT IF

WHOLE SERIES OF LUINISOLAR EQUATIONS IN COLUMN C VIZ DESCENDING FROM CENTURY TO CENTURY IN THE CENTRAL COLUMN OF GREGORIAN ERAS KEEP THE EQUATION THE SAMIE AS BEFORE WHEN A SINGLE  OCCURS ON EITHER SIDE DIMINISH THE LAST EQUATION BY 1 WHEN THE ASTERISK APPEARS ON NEITHER SIDE AND INCREASE THE LAST EQUATION BY 1 WHEN THE   APPEAR ON BOTH SIDES BUT LIMITING OF COURSE THIS GENERALLY BUT NOT UNIFORMLY RECEDING SERIES BY THE CYCLE OF 30 OR 0 IN THIS MANNER IS READILY PRODUCED A SUCCESSION OF SUITABLE EPACTS SUSCEPTIBLE OF INDEFINITE EXTENSION AND REQUIRINIG NO SUPPLEMENTARY PRECEPTS SUCH AS LORD MACCLES FIELD CONCEIVED WOULD BECOME NECESSARY AFTER THE YEAR 4199 BEFORE THAT DISTANT AGE ARRIVES THE CIVIL CALENDAR WILL DOUBTLESS UNDERGO THE SLIGHT MODIFICATION GENERALLY RECOMMENDED BV MODERN ASTRONOMERS OF OMITTING A SINGLE BIS SEXTILE INTERCALATION AT EVERY 4000TH YEAR WHICH WOULD MAINTAIN AN ALMOST PERFECT AC CORDANCE BETWEEN THE SEASONS AND THE BEGINNINGS OF THE YEAR FOR A THOUSAND CENTURIES TO COME AND THE ECCLESIASTICAL CALENDAR ALSO WILL MOST PROBABLY RECEIVE COTEMPORANEOUSLY T ALTHOUGH THE EQUATION 1 ON THE RIGHT OF THE CENTURIAL FIGURES 16 RESULTS NECESSARILY FROM THE ARBITRARY APPROPRIATION OF THE EPACT 26 WITH THE GOLDEN NUMBER 6 TO THE FIRST YEAR OF THE REFORMED CALENDAR AND DOES NOT DEPEND UPON BUT IS THE SAME WITH THE PRECEDING EQUATION IT NEVERTHELESS HAPPENS IN CONSEQUENCE OF NO LEAP YEAR BEING SUPPRESSED UNTIL 1700 AND OF NO EPACT BEING ADDED UNTIL 1800 TO OBEY THE GENERAL LAW OF THE ASTERISKS AS EXPRESSED IN THE TEXT116 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR SOME NEW ADJUSTMENT BUT PURSUING WITHOUT REGARD TO FUTURE REFORMS OF EITHER CALENDAR THE PLAN I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED AS FAR AS THE 87TH CENTURIAL FIGURES AND COMPARING AT EVERY STEP THE RESULTS DERIVED FROM MY GENERAL RULE WHEN APPLYING THE SUCCESSIVE EQUA TIONS SO OBTAINED WITH THE EPACTS SET DOWN IN THE EXTENDED TABLES I FOUND THEM TO BE IN EXACT CORRESPONDENCE WITH EACH OTHER LINE BY LINE AND LETTER BY LETTER THROUGHOUT THE CIR CUIT FROM LITTLE A TO CAPITAL P IN FACT THE EQUATIONS IN COLUMN C ARE IDENTICAL WITH THE FIGURES WHICH STAND IN THE FIRST COLUMN OF TABLE II ENCYCLOP BRIT ART CIALENDAR UNDER THE GOLDEN NUMBER 1 AND IMNMEDIATELY BY THE SIDE OF THE 30 LETTERS RUNNING UP THE COLUMN FROM D TO C DELAMBRE PRONOUNCES THE EPACTLETTERS USELESS I TRUST THEREFORE THAT FOR DISCARDING THEM IN COMPANY WITH THE DOMIBICAL FROM MY TABLET I SHALL NOT INCUR THE REPROACH OF BEING HOSTILE TO LETTERS IN GENERAL THE GREGORIAN ANNUAL EPACT BEING THUS ACCESSIBLE WITH VERY LITTLE NMORE TROUBLE THAN THE ORDINARY PROCESS OF FINDING THE GOLDEN NUMBER SINCE THREE OUT OF THE FOUR LINES OF FIGURES TO BE ADDED TOGETHER REQUIRE NO COMPUTATION BUT MERELY TO BE SET DOWN ON PAPER IN THE ORDER STATED IT REMAINS FOR ME TO ELUCIDATE MY MODE OF DEDUCING FROM THE EPACT THE PASCHAL TERM OR THE 14TH DAY OF THE PASCHAL MOON MOST COMMONLY BUT IMPROPERLY CALLED  THE PASCHAL FULLMOON ON WHICH EASTER SUNDAY DEPENDS THE PASCHAL MOON IS THAT WHOSE 14TH DAY COUNTING THE NEW IMOON AS THE FIRST NEVER FALLS EARLIER THAN THE 21ST OF MARCH NOR LATER THAN THE 18TH OF APRIL RECKONING TLLE CALENDAR LUNATIONS OF THOSE MONTHS RESPECTIVELY TO CONTAIN 30 AND 29 DAYS FOR EASTER ACCORDING TO THE USAGE OF THE WESTERN CHURCHES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE SANCTIONED BY THE COUNCIL OF NICE MUST BE CELEBRATED ON A SUNDAY WHICH SUNDAY MUSTFOLLOWV THE 14TH DAY OF THE PASCHAL MOON SO THAT WHENEVER THE PASCHAL 14TH OR TERM FELL ON SUNDAY EASTER COULD NOT ARRIVE UNTIL THE NEXT SUNDAY IF THE TERM FELL ON SATURDAY EASTER CAME ONE DAY AFTER THAT SATURDAY VIZ ON THE NEXT DAY CONSEQUENTLY THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE PAS CHAL RERIM AND EASTER MIGHT BE 7 DAYS BUT COULD NEVER BE LESS TLHAN ONE DAY AND SINCE THE TERM COULD NOT HAPPEN BEFORE THE CALENDARVERNAL EQUINOX WHICH WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE ASTRONONOICAL FACT WAS BY THE CHURCH INVARIABLY FIXED ON THE 21ST OF MARCH EASTER SUNDAY IT IS CLEAR MUST HAVE ITS PLACE BETWEEN THE 22D OF MARCH AND THE 25TH OF APRIL BOTH DAYS INCLUSIVE NOW SUPPOSING THE 14TH DAY OF THE PASCHAL MLOON TO COINCIDE WITH THE CALENDAR EQUINOX THAT MOON MUST HAVE BEEN NEW OR IN ITS FIRST DAY ON THE 8TH OF MARCH FOR 21 LESS 13 IS 8 AND THE PRECEDING MNOON MUST HAVE BEEN 23 DAYS OLD ON THE 1ST OF MARCH JUST A WEEK EARLIER FOR 8 LESS 7 EQUALS 1 THAT IS TO SAY THE MNOON ON THE 1ST DAY OF MARCH NUST HAVE BEEN OF EXACTLY THE SAMIE AGE AS IT WAS ON THE 1ST OF JANUARY THE IN TERVAL BETWEEN THOSE DAYS IN COMMON YEARS BEING TWO LUNATIONS ONE OF 30 THE OTHER OF 29 DAYS OR 59 DAYS IN ALL THE EPACTS BELONGING TO JANUARY AND MARCH ARE OF COURSE IDENTICAL AS THEY ARE SEEN TO BE IN EVERY EPACT ALNMANAC AND IT IS MANIFEST THAT WHEN THE CALENDARMOONS AGE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE YEAR EXCEEDS 23 DAYS IN WHICH CASE THE NEW MOON OF MARCH WOULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE 8TH AND ITS 14TH DAY CONSEQUENTLY BEFORE THE EQUINOX THE PASCHAL NEW MOONT WILL BE IN APRIL AND WLHEN 23 OR LESS WILL HAPPEN IN MARCHMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 117 IF THEN THE PASCHAL TERM OCCURS ON THE 21ST OF MARCH THE ANNUAL EPACT IS 23 IF ON THE 22D  IT IS 22 IF ON THE 23D  IT IS 21 AND SO ON UP    TO THE 31ST  AND DOWN TO THE EPACT 13 THE DAY OF THE MONTH RISING BY ONE AS REGULARLY AS THE EPACT DESCENDS BY ONE SO THAT THEIR SUM IS ALWAYS THE SAME      VIZ 44 AND THE PASCHAL TERM IN MARCH MUST OF COURSE BE THAT NUMBER LESS THE EPACT ADVANCING WITH THE DAY OF THE MONTH TO THE 1ST OF APRIL WE DESCEND TO THE EPACT 12 TO THE 2D 4 TO 11 TO THE 3D 4 TO 10 AND SO ON UP    TO THE 12TH  AND DOWN TO THE EPACT 1 THE SUMN BEING ALWAYS    13 AND THE PASCHAL TERM IN THAT PART OF APRIL WHICH PRECEDES THE 13TH IS 13 LESS THE EPACT ARRIVING IN LIKE MANNER AT THE 13TH OF APRIL WE HAVE THE EPACT 0 OR 30 AT THE 14THL  29 AT THE 15TH  28 AND SO ON UP     TO THE 18TH  AND DOWN TO THE EPACT 25 THE SUMI BEING ALWAYS       43 AND THE PASCHAL TERM FOR THE REST OF APRIL IS 43 OR 30  13 LESS THE EPACT SUBJECT HOWEVER TO TWO EXCEPTIONS IN THE CASE OF THE DOUBLE EPACTS 2526 AND 2524 THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR OF EPACTS SEE TABLE III ENCYCLOP BRIT ART  CALENDAR HAS BEEN SO CONSTRUCTED THAT THE EPACT 25 BELONGS WHENEVER THE GOLDEN NUMBER EXCEEDS 11 TO THE SAME DAY WITH THE EPACT 26 AND IS THEN MARKED WITH AN ACCENT TO DISTINGUISH IT NOW SINCE 43 LESS 26 GIVES THE 17TH DAY OF APRIL AS THE PROPER PASCHAL TERM OR LIMIT 25 IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE SAME RESULT MUST BE SUBTRACTED FROM 42 BY A LIKE CONTRIVANCE THE EPACT 25 NOT ACCENTED BELONGS WLHEN THE GOLDEN NUMBER DOES NOT EXCEED 11 TO THE SAMNE DAY WITH THE EPACT 24 AND SINCE 43 LESS 25 YIELDS THE 18TH OF APRIL AS THE PROPER PASEHAL TERM OR LIMIT 24 IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE SAME RESULT MUST LIKEWISE BE SUBTRACTED FRON    42 IN THIS MANNER BOTH THE EXCEPTIONS ARE READILY PROVIDED FOR WITH A SINGLE DIMINUEND 42 3 THIS ARTIFICE EMPLOYED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TABLE OF GREGORIAN EPACTS BY MAKINIG THE AGE OF THE MOOLN TO DIFFER OCCASIONALLY A DAY MORE FROM THE TRUTH THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE PRESERVES BETWEELN THE OLD AND NEW CALENDARS A CERTAIN CONVENTIONAL RESEMBLANCE WHICH CONSISTS IN THE NONREPETITION OF A GIVEN ANNUAL EPACT WITHIN THE SAME LUNAR CYCLE FOR THE REASON OF THIS ARBITRARY MODE OF WRITING THE EPACTS AND OF VARYING CONSEQUENTLY THE PASCHAL TERM I MUST REFER TO REGULAR TREATISES ON THE SUBJECT REMARKING ONLY THAT THIS DEVICE OF CLAVIUS TO WHICH I HAVE ADJUSTED THE OPERATION OF MY OWN DOES BY NO MEANS PREVENT IN EITHER STYLE EASTER SUNDAY FROM FALLING REPEATEDLY IN THE COURSE OF ANY SINGLE CYCLE OF 19 YEARS TWICE AND SOMETIMES THRICE ON THE SAME DAY OF THE MONTH IN THE LAST LUNAR CYCLE FOR INSTANCE ENDING WITH 1843 THE NEW STYLE EASTER OCCURRED THRICE ON THE 3D DAY OF APRIL AND IN DUPLICATE FOUR TIMES ON OTHER DAYS OF THE MONTH IN THE PRESENT CYCLE ENDING IN 1862 LIKE DUPLICATE EASTERS ON CERTAIN DAYS OF THE MONTH WILL HAPPEN SIX TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THE VERY FIRST CYCLE OF THE REFORM AT ROME SIMILAR COINCIDENCES TOOK PLACE THREE TIMES IN NEW STYLE AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO SEVEN TIMES IN OLD STYLE IF THE JULIAN MODE OF RECKONIING HAD NOT BEEN ABANDONED VOL X30118 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR THE GOLDEN NUMBER BEING THE REMAINDER AFTER DIVISION BY 19 OF THE YEAR PLUS 1 THE EXCESS OF 10 WHERE THE YEAR ITSEF IS TO BE DIVIDED BY 19 AGREEABLY TO MY RULE BECOMES AN EQUIVALENT EXPRESSION FOR THE EXCESS OF 11 IN THE TABLES REFERRED TO IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT THE GREGORIAN EPACTS IN TABLE D OF MY TABLET ARE MERELY ARRANGED IN SETS OR SEQUENCES IN A MORE ORDERLY MANNER BEGINNING AT 1 AND ENDING AT 30 THAN THEY PRESENTED THEMSELVES IN THE COURSE OF THE FOREGOING EXPLANATIONS AND THAT THE SHORT COLUMN OF FOUR NUMBERS FROM WHICH THEY ARE ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL PLACES IN THE SERIES TO BE DEDUCTED NAMELY 13 44 43 AND 42 ASSUMES AT THE SAME TIME GREATER SYMMETRY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE NUMBERS AND THE EPACT CAN NEVER IN APRIL EXCEED 18 BUT WHENEVER THE 14TH DAY OF THE PASCHAL MOON FALLS ON THE 18TH DAY OF THAT MONTH AND HAPPENS AT THE SAME TINME TO BE SUNDAY EASTER SUNDAY MUST BE A WEEK LATER OR THE 25TH OF APRIL IT MUST ALWAYS BE AT LEAST ONE DAY AFTER THE PASCHAL TRERM BUT WHETHER IT IS TO BE CELEBRATED ONE OR SEVEN OR ANY INTERMEDIATE NUMBER OF DAYS AFTER THAT TERM WILL ALWAYS BE CORRECTLY DETERMINED WHEN THE DAY OF THE WEEK ON WHICH THE TERM OCCURS HAS BEEN FOUND BY THE CIVIL CALENDAR IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE NUMBER OF DAYS TO BE COUNTED FORWARDS MUST BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 8 AND THE NUMBER WHICH INDICATES THE DAY OF TLLE WEEK BEFORE THE CLOSE OF TLHE PAST YEAR I HAD PREPARED IN MANUSCRIPT A SPECIMEN OF THE PERPETUAL CALENDAR DESCRIBED IN THE FOREGOING PAGES AND HAD SOLVED BY MEANS OF IT NUMEROUS CHRONOLOGICAL QUESTIONS TRYING UNIFORMLY THE CORRECTNESS OF MY RESULTS BY THE TABLES AND FORINULW OF LORD MACCLESFIELD AND MR GALLOWAY WHEN I LEARNED FROM THE JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE FOR NOVEMBER THAT THE NEXT BRITISLH ALMANAC AND COM PANION WOULD CONTAIN AN ARTICLE FROM THE PEN OF MR AUGUSTUS DE MORGAN OF UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON ON THE SUBJECT OF A CONTROVERSY NOT UNLIKELY TO ARISE RESPECTING THE PROPER DAY OF CELEBRATING EASTER IN 1845 MY RULES GAVE ME AS THE TABLET SHOWS THE 23D OF MARCH BUT BEING NATURALLY DESIROUS OF TESTING THEIR ACCURACY IN THAT AS WELL AS OTHER INSTANCES BY SUCH DISTINGUISHED MATHEMATICAL AUTHORITY I AWAITED THE RECEIPT OF A COPY OF THAT INSTRUCTIVE ANNUAL WHICH A FRIEND HAD ORDERED FROM ENGLAND AND WHICH HE KINDLY PLACED IN MY HANDS IN THE COURSE OF THE WINTER AS IT EMBRACED WHAT I HAD ANTI CIPATED A VERY LEARNED INTERESTING FULL AND SATISFACTORY ESSAY ON THE ECCLESIASTICAL CALENDAR I COULD NOT BUT BE HIGHLY GRATIFIED AT FINDING MY RULES CONFIRMED BY EVERY EXAMPLE THEREIN COMPUTED AND MORE ESPECIALLY BY THE DISCOVERY THAT OWING TO THE MECHANISM OF MY TABLET WHICH SPARED ME THE LABOUR OF SEVERAL ARITHMETICAL STEPS WHICH MR DE MORGAN WHO PROPOSED TO HIMSELF AND HAS ABLY EXECUTED THE MORE DIFFICULT TASK OF PURE CALCULATION ACCORDING TO DELAMBRES ANALYTICAL FORMULE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL TABULATION HAD BEEN COMPELLED UNDER THE ASSIGNED LIMITS OF HIS PROBLEMN TO TAKE I WAS ENABLED TO ATTAIN IN MOUCH LESS TIME BY RULES OCCUPYING LESS SPACE AND REQUIRING LESS MENTAL AND MANUAL EFFORT THE SAME RESULTS WITH THOSE YIELDED BY HIS FIFTEEN 1 SLHORT ARITH MIETICAL DIRECTIONS GIVEN AT PAGES  5 AND 16 IT APPEARED TO ME BESIDES THAT THE RISK OF ERROR WAS CONSIDERABLY LESSENED IN MY PROCESS BY THE OPERATIONS CONSISTING FOR THE MOST PART EITHER OF THE MERE SETTING DOWN OR OF THE ADDITION OF FIGURES THESE FIGURES BEINGMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 119 IN TWO OF THE ITEMS EQUATIONS OBTAINED AT A SINGLE INSPECTION AND IN THREE OTHER ITEMS THE YEAR ITSEF IT IS FOR OTHERS HOWEVER TO DECIDE AND I SHOULD MOST CHEERFULLY SUBMIT THE QUESTION TO THE TWO ABOVENAMED EMINENT LIVING AUTHORITIES ON WHOM I HAVE RELIED WHETHER THE TABLET WHICH I NOW PRESENT TO THE SOCIETY AS A NEW  METHOD PROFESSING ONLY TO COMBINE VERY CONDENSED TABLES WITH PLAIN RULES MAY NOT POSSESS A SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF PRACTICAL UTILITY TO DESERVE PUBLICATION INTENT UPON RENDERING THE TABLET USEFUL IN CALCULATIONS RELATING PRINCIPALLY TO THE NEW STYLE I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF EMBRACING IN IT THE ANCIENT CHURCH CALENDAR NOW GONE INTO DISUSE IN ALMOST EVERY PART OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD EXCEPT THE EMPIRE OF RUSSIA HAD I NOT MNET WITH THE  VERY SIMPLE TABLE GIVEN BY MR DE MORGAN AT PAGE 32 AND WHICH HE SAYS  WILL SUPPLY THE PLACE OF ALL RULES AS SOON AS THE GOLDEN NUMBER AND DOMI NICAL LETTER ARE KNOWN NOW SINCE IT HAS BEEN STEADILY MY AIM TO ELIMINATE BOTH THOSE PORTIONS OF THE SCAFFOLDING OF THE CALENDAR MY WORK SEEMED INCOMPLETE UNLESS I COULD STILL DISPENSE WITH THEM AND COULD DEVISE SOME OTHER MEANS AT LEAST AS EASY IN PRACTICE AS THE TEN RULES PLACED BY MR DE MORGAN ON THE SUBSEQUENT PAGE FOR DETERMINING THE OLD STYLE EASTER I SOUGHT IN VAIN

THE  PERPETUAL LUNAR CALENDAR BOTH CLEARLY EXHIBIT THE SAME CONSTANT CONCURRENCE BETWEEN THE PASCHAL 14TH OF THE MOON AND THE PLACE OF THE YEAR IN THE CYCLE OF 19 WHICH IS MEN TIONED BY MR DE MORGAN AND SHOWN IN HIS TABLE WE HAVE THEREFORE ONLY TO TRANSLATE INTO THEIR CORRESPONDING EPACTS THE SEVERAL GOLDEN NUMBERS IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY THERE STAND AND WE SHALL OBTAIN A SERIES OF 19 JULIAN EPACTS DESCENDING WHILE THE DAYS OF THE MONTH RISE AS WE BEFORE WITNESSED IN THE CASE OF THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR WITH THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE EXPOSITION THAT BLANKS ARE LEFT AT EACH OF THE TEN PLACES BETWEEN THE 21ST OF MARCH AND THE 18TH OF APRIL WHERE THERE IS NO GOLDEN NUMBER AND WHERE THERE CAN BE NO EPACT SINCE THE NUMBERS WANTING TO COMPLETE A REGULAR SERIES VIZ 13 10 8 5 2 30 27 24 21 AND 19 AS WELL AS 16 HAD NO EXISTENCE AS EPACTS IN THE ANCIENT CALENDAR THE EPACT 29 FORMS A CASE BY ITSELF ON ACCOUNT OF THE PECULIAR INTERVAL OF 12 BETWEEN IT AND THE SUCCEEDING EPACT 11 IN THE REFORMED CALENDAR THE INTERVAL OF 12 ALWAYS PRECEDES THE EPACT BELONGING TO EVERY YEAR WHICH IS A MULTIPLE OF 19 BUT IF THE JULIAN XXIX BE TREATED LIKE THE GREGORIAN 0 OR XXX AND BE MADE TO CHANGE PLACES WITH

LENGTH OF CIVIL MONTHS IN ALL LEAP YEARS AS WELL AS THAT OF ARTIFICIAL LUNATIONS IN THE EXISTING CHURCH CALENDAR AND THAT THE 13TH AND 5TH WERE THE DAYS OF THE MONTH ON WHICH THE IDES AND NONES IN EVERY MONTH BUT FOUR OF THE OLD ROMAN CALENDAR BEGAN IT IS OF MORE IMPORTANCE HOWEVER TO STATE THAT HAVING PROCURED IN APRIL LAST THROUGH THE POLITENESS OF PROFESSOR E OTIS KENDALL FROM THE LIBRARY OF THE HIGH SCHOOL OF PHILA DELPHIA THE USE OF DELANMBRES HISTORY OF MODERN ASTRONOMY I HAVE SINCE THEN CALCU LATED ACCORDING TO MY TABLET EVERY EXAMPLE GIVEN IN BOOK I ON THE REFORMATION OF THE CALENDAR INCLUDING THE EXTREME CASES PUT BY DELAMBRE TO ILLUSTRATE HIS PRINCIPLES IN THE CONTROVERSY WITH CICCOLINI ABOUT THE RELATIVE MERITS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE FORMUKE AND THAT I HAVE FOUND MY RESULTS NOT ONLY TO CORRESPOND UNIFORMLY WITH THOSE WHICH ARE THERE COMPUTED BUT TO BE REACHED MUCH MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY ALSO THAN BY THE PROCESSES THERE EMPLOYED I HAVE MOREOVER BEEN PROMPTED BY CURIOSITY AS WELL AS BY CAUTION TO EXTEND MY SECULAR CORRECTIONS AS FAR AS DELAMBRE HAD PURSUED HIS IN THE CONNOISSANCE DES TEMS FOR 1817 AND TO CARRY DOWN ACCORDINGLY WITH THE MECHANISM OF THE ASTERISKS MY EQUATIONS IN COLUMNS A AND C TO THE 500TH CENTURY I COMPARED AS I PROCEEDED A FEW CASES AT VARIOUS EPOCHS AND MANY NEAR THE TERMINATION OF MNY TASK WITH THE ANSWERS CONTAINED IN HIS BEAUTIFUL  TABLE PASCALE AT PAGE 43 BOOK I ASTRON MODERNE WHERE THE GREGORIAN EASTERS ARE OBTAINED BY INSPECTION AFTER THE DOMINICAL LETTER AND EPACT ARE KNOWN AND I HAD THE PLEASURE TO FIND IN EVERY INSTANCE THE RESULTS STILL IDENTICAL WITHOUT DOUBTING FOR A MOMENT OR PRESUMING TO CALL IN QUESTION THE CORRECTNESS OF THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THAT PASCHAL TABLE HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED I FEEL ITNEVERTHELESS INCUMNBENT ON ME TO REMARK THAT FROM THE TEXT OF DELAMBRE AT PAGE 24 IT WOULD APPEAR THAT CLAVIUSS GREAT TABLE WHICH IS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY CONSULTED AS A STANDARD DIFFERS FROM DELAMBRES SMNALL ONE BY INCLTUDING AMNONG THE YEARS IN WHICH EASTER HAPPENS ON THE 22D OF MARCH THE YEAR 3860 ACCORDING TO DELAMBRES FORMULE AND PASCHAL TABLE THE DOMINICAL LETTER BEING G AND THE EPACT 24 IT WILL FALL ON THE 22D OF APRIL ACCORDING TO GAUSSS FORMULA M BEINCG 2 AND N BEING 5 ON THE SAME DAY BY THE TABLES OF LORD MACCLESFIELD AND MR GALLOWAY THE GOLDEN NUMBER BEING 4 AND THE DOMNINICAL LETTER G ON THE SAME DAY AND FINALLY BY MR DE MORGANS RUILES AND BY MY OWN ON THE SAME DAY THAT IS ON THE 22D OF APRIL WITH SUCH A PREPONDERANCE OF CONCURRENT TESTIMONY IN FAVOUR OF THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH I ARRIVE I CANNOT BUT SUPPOSE THAT CLAIUS VOL N31122 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR MUST EITHER BE IN ERROR OR THAT THE MONTH HAS BEEN BY SOME INADVERTENCE MISQUOTED FROM HIS RRABLE BY DELAMRBRE THE DAY OR QUANTI6ME OF THE MNONTH IS THE SAME ACCORDING TO ALL THE MATHEMATICIANS THUS FAR NAMED AND THE MONTH MUST BE APRIL FOR THE 22D OF MARCH CORRESPONDS WITH THURSDAY AND NOT WITH SUNDAY IN THAT YEAR AND THE PASCHAL NEW MOON CANNOT HAPPEN IN MARCH WLHEN THE EPACT EXCEEDS 23 IT SEEMS NO LESS UNACCOUNTABLE THAT SIR HARRIS NICOLAS WHO GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGES SOME ASSISTANCE FROM MR DE MORGAN WHEN PREPARING HIS  CHRONOLOGY OF HISTORY PUBLISHED IN 1833 IN LARDNERS CABINET CYCLOPEDIA SHOULD IMAKE THE EASTER OF 3860 BY THE NUMBER OF DIRECTION IN HIIS TABLE H TO BE THE 15TH OF APRILJUST A WEEK EARLIER THAN MY INSTRUCTORS HAVE COMPUTED IT AND YET NOT AGREEING WITH CLAVIUSS DECISION AS BEFORE REPORTED I SHALL BE GLAD IF THE POINTING OUT OF THIS STRANGE DISCREPANCY SHOULD LEAD TO THE REMOVAL

IN MANY OTHER SCIENTIFIC AND POPULAR WORKS OF REFERENCE A LIKE TABLE CON TAINING NUMBERS OF DIRECTION SO CALLED SAID TO BE  ADAPTED TO THE NEW STYLE IS GIVEN BUT IN TERMS UNSANCTIONED BY THOSE LATER AND ABLER ANALYSTS WHOM I HAVE CONSULTED AND ON WLHOSE PRINCIPLES I HIAVE RELIED CERTAIN IT IS THAT SIR FI NICOLASS TABLES H AND K PAGES 57 AND 58 EDITION II ARE ENTIRELY AT VARIANCE WITH EACH OTHER IN REGARD TO THE EASTER DAY OF EVERY YEAR HAVING THE GOLDEN NUMLBER 14 OR EPACT 24 BETWEEN 1590 AND 1685 BOTH INCLUSIVE AND IT IS EQUALLY TRUE THAT DELAMBRES FORMULE DO NOT AUTHENTI CATE THE EASTERS

OUT OF A CHANGE MADE BY ME WITH A VIEW TO BREVITY BUT WITHOUT DUE CARE IN THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL INANUSCRIPT WHICH DIRECTED THAT EVERY ZERO RESULTING FROM THE DIVISION OF THE SUM BY 30 SHOULD BE CALLED XXX IN NEW STYLE BUT XXIX IN OLDA RESTRICTION EXACTLY EQUIVALENT TO THE ONE LHERE PRESCRIBED AND THAT BY WHICH ALL THE COMPUTATIONS CONNECTED WITH MIY DEVICE WERE REALLY GOVERNEDMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 123 THE FACILITY OF THIS METHOD ARISES PRINCIPALLY FROM THE GREGORIAN SECULAR EQUATIONS IN COLUMNS A AND C BEING MECHANICALLY FORMED AND TABULATED TO OBTAIN THE SAME COR RECTIONS ARITHMETICALLY NO SIMPLER RULES THAN THE FOLLOWING COULD PERHAPS BE DEVISED AND A COMPARISON OF THE TWO PROCESSES WILL THEREFORE EXHIBIT FAIRLY THE ECONOMY OF TIME AND TROUBLE WHICH

DIMINISHED BY C 17 4 C 68 THAT IS TO SAY BY THE QUOTIENT ARISING FROM THE DIVISION OF  FOUR TILMES THE CENTURIAL FIGURES  LESS 68 BY 100 BEFORE BEING DIVIDED BY 3 BUT THEY MUST BE USED IN THE REST OF

THE REQUISITE EXPLANATIONS IN REGARD TO LEAP YEARS WHICH FOR THAT PERIOD ARE SO EXPRESSED BY CHRONOLOGISTS AS NEVER TO BE MULTIPLES OF 4 MIGHT UNDULY EXTEND OR COMPLICATE THE TABLET SINCE ITS

GALLOWAY AND MR DE MORGAN WHO HAVE AT MY REQUEST HAD THE GOODNESS TO CONSULT FOR ME THE FIFTH VOLUME OF CLAVIUSS MATHE MATICAL WORKS AND TO FURNISH ME WITH A FEW PARTICULARS FROIN THE EXPLICATION THERE GIVEN OF THE REFORMED ROMAN CALENDAR THAT MY CONJECTURE RESPECTING THE DISCREPANCY IN A SINGLE CASE BETWEEN MY RESULTS AND THOSE SET DOWN IN THE GREAT TABLE OF CLAVIUS AS WELL AS IN THE TEXT OF DELAMBRE TURNS OUT TO BE CORRECT ON TRACING THE DIFFERENCE TO ITS SOURCE IT APPEARS THAT THE TABLE AND THE TEXT ARE ALIKE ERRONEOUS BUT ACCIDENTALLY SO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH WHICH I HAVE BEEN HONOURED ON THE POINT IN QUESTION IS THIS IN THE TABLE THERE IS AN  OBVIOUS MISPRINT AT THE ANGLE WHERE THE LINE BELONGING TO THE YEAR 3860 MEETS THE COLUMN OF EASTERS IN WHICH COLUMN THE MONTLHS OF MARCH AND APRIL ARE NOT OTHERWISE DISTINGUISHED THAN BY THEIR INITIAL LETTERS M AND A THE EASTER FOR THAT YEAR  STANDS 22 M BUT OUGHT TO BE 22 A FOR IN THE SAME LINE AND IN NEARLY ADJOINING

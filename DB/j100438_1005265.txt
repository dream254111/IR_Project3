a New Perpetual Calenidar Civil and Ecclesiastical Julian and Gregorian By Williamn McIlvaine Read August 15 1845 WHEN my attention at school was first turned to the solution of chronological problems I received a strong impression that the Dominical Letters formed too complex and cum brous an appendage of the calendar According to the directions given in Pikes Arith metic at that time a standard elementary work one of the first seven letters of the alphabet in regular order A always standing at the first day of January must be pre fixed to every day in the common year of 365 days The letter which in this series happened to be affixed to the first Sunday in January was called the Dominical Letter of that year as marking all its Sundays but in leap years the next following letter was to serve as the Dominical Letter for the first two months of the year A B C D E F G with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 subjoined constituted a table the numbers being an index to the letters By a rule whose principle was left unexplained the sum of the Julian year its fourth part and four was to be divided by seven If no remainder occurred G was the Dominical Letter but if any number remained that number of letters beginning the rec koning with F was to be counted in a retrograde order from G to reach the Dominical Letter or on deducting the remainder from seven you might obtain the index of the Dominical Letter counting forwards from A The rule was shorter for Gregorian years but in both styles the Sunday letter was double in every leap year and after the proper letter had been found it was required to count backwards again in order to know on what day of the week the first of January happened Finally if the day of the week corresponding with a given day of any other month was wanted the tedious process of adding the day of the mnonth to the number of days in all the preceding months and dividing the sum by seven must be gone through and the answer deduced from another remainder104 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW IERPETUAL CALENDAR The whole system seemed to me  cycle and epicycle orb in orb the week appearing to revolve about the letter A and the year around the week I had imagined the structure of the Julian year when once divested of the absurdity of calends nones and ides all counted backwards and after having the week introduced to be essentially simple and although the Dominical Letters for ages consecrated to clerical use had I knew been adopted by the ablest astronomers and chronologists of modern timnes and were still employed conjointly with the golden number by learned judges of the Kings Bench in England for ascertaining the legal periods of the four terms of court yet I could not help believing that some less circuitous method would sooner or later supersede an apparatus which however true in its results and however lucid in comparison with some other parts of the machinery causes most persons from its cormplexity alone to consider even the civil calendar a subject of much difficulty and thaat of the Church as an impenetrable mystery I have accordingly always looked with particular interest at the Perpetual Almanacs so called but serving only for a single century which have since fallen in my way with a vague hope of being able to discover in them the germ of some simpler mode of computation On consulting about two years ago the seventh edition of the Encyclopedia Britan nica I met accidentally with a new welldigested and perspicuous article on the  Calen dar from the pen of rrhomas Galloway Esq F R S one of the Vicepresidents of the Royal Astronomical Society and was gratified at learning from it lhow much had beeln done within the present halfcentury by the analytical skill of Gauss and Delambre towards disencumbering the calendar of numerous tables and substituting for them plainer formula I perceived however and not without disappointmient that the Dominical Let ters were still retained among the elements of the algebraical equations and on applying them arithmetically I found my computation embarrassed at the outset by the quantity 7rn joined with many quantities differing in sign contained in the first equation and at the close by another inconvenient equation p  P  L  1 involving the value not only of the Sunday letter but of a letter belonging to the fifteenth day of the calendar moon After a careful reperusal of Mr Galloways essay I was struck with the fact to whiclh I had never before adverted that the first year of the Christian era beganr with Saturday which being the seventh day of the week and corresponding with seven the number of the hebdomadal cycle suggested to me the possibility of making that number a convenient startingpoint of an indefinitely prolonged succession of ages or chronological periods ill which the ordinal numbers appropriate to the other six days of the week might perform in a direct and more natural and intelligible manner the same function that the Dominical Letters in a reversed order and in connexion with the Solar Cycle had heretofore done Pursuing as the amusement of many leisure hours this casual thought I have succeeded in constructing what I believe to be a ntew instrument of plain materials but rather bet ter adapted than the old for ordinary popular use and perhaps of a laboursaving cha racter even in the lhands of the learned although to this last considerationi I wish to be understood as not attaching much importanice but merely as asking the opinion of mathematicians in regardl to the JlaIl it at first blush theyr should 10cm it at all worthly ofMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 105 their scrutiny To them a difference of  methods technically so called being for the most part of little cQnsequence my proposal to free the civil calendar from algebraic formule wlhich are apt to convey to their minds the best evidence and guidance may at first sound strangely but the attempt will possibly appear to them upon reflection quite consonant with the improved spirit of the present age which brings whenever prac ticable things of common concern and use to common comnprehension In regard to the Church calendar indeed which Delambre declares to be  excessivement complique et qui pour etre bien compris exige lattention la plus soutenue I must admit it to be doubtful whether in any shape yet assumed it is likely to become an inviting or fruitful object of inquiry to the generality of persons The next page exhibits and the succeeding one exemplifies my plan the constituent parts of which are embodied in a single Tablet or Perpetual Calendar having its pecu liarities specified in the title In addition to the two general Rules it will be seen to con sist principally of a central column headed Eras which serves as an index to two series of corrections called in compliance with customary fictions and nomnenclature the Solar and Lunisolar Equations These are comprised in two side columns of equal length with the central one and accompanying it column A being appropriated to civil and column C to ecclesiastical purposes The Julian Era though employed by astronomers as a convenient universal measure of timne is here limited to years after Christ but embraces of course all those years which precede the adoption of the reformed calendar at various epochs by the several nations of Christendom That is to say the equations 5 and 0 respectively standing at the head of the side columns and  beside the Era denominated Julian after Christ are in tended to be used constantly until such a reformation has actually taken place The Era denominated  Gregorian from 1582 is divided into centurial figures but the equations standing beside these subdivisions are not meant to be applied to the interval for example of nearly 170 years which occurred between the adoption of the New Style at Rome and in Great Britain Without this prelimlinary cauition the word  Eras as employed in the tablet might possibly mislead some readers The asterisks annexed to the centurial figures are not essential to the use of the Tablet but are retained for the purpose of better elucidating its structure The intervals between them on the civil side make known however at once through the eye those centesimal years which in New Style are not bissextile and they furnish also a ready means of as certaining the whole number of days by which at any period after 1600 the two styles differ from each other For instance in years having the centurial figures 26 the differ ence between Old and New Style amounts to 18 days for 10 the number of days origi nally suppressed together with the 8 centurial figures which are destitute of asterisks viz 17 18 19 21 22 23 25 and 26 make the sum 18 in like manner the difference with our present centurial figures is 12 days for 10  2 17 and 18 being unmarked  12 The two auxiliary tables B and D demand no attention until some

itself will probably be best understood by expanding my original course of reasoning into figures in the following way The Ist day of year 1 of Christ having the Sunday letter B was SATURDAY or the 7th day of the week which number 7 agreeing with that of the weekly cycle never to be interrupted suggests this plan of freeing the calendar from Dominical Letters If referring to the following Table SERIES I to the 1st day of the year 1 we add 5 in order to reach and include the 7th or last day of that cycle the sum 7 divided by 7 gives us the remainder 0 which remainder being always taken as the equivalent of 7 the divisor conformably to arithmetical usage in the case of all other cycles becomes a fit expression for SATURDAY and 0 or a week completed will thus represent perpetually that day of the week in the scale of time The same process with the succeeding ordinal days of the year exhibits a perfectly correct expression for the other six intermediate days of the week as in SERIES

Showing that Year 1 begins and ends 52 entire weeks or 364 days intervening on 0 or SATURDAY A like Table for succeedinig years would show in year 2 its first and last day v   by the Remainder 1 to be SUNDAY in year 3 its first and last day    by the Remainder 2 to be MONDAY Year 4 is a leap year but not until the 29th of February its first day therefore would be shown   by the Remainder 3 to be TUESDAY and its last or 365tlh day     by the Remainder 4 to be WEDNESDAY This result for the end of the year 4 would be the same if instead of calling its last the 366th day   we add to the 365th day of a comimon year the year       4 then by the general rule its fourth part 1 for the first Leap Year of the Era and constant      5 The sum      375 divided by 7 gives Remainder 4 or WEDNES DAY for the 31st of December But this rule as applied to the beginning or 1st day of January of the year 4 would make it also to be Wednesday which is not the true day but Tuesday is as we have seen above Hence the exception stated in regard to the months of January and February in leap years viz to take the preceding as the true day since no intercalation occurs until the 29th of February I proceed to show the efMect of seven such quadrennial intercalations to advance by exactly a week the day of the week after going through the first complete cycle of the Julian EraMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW

of years SATURDAY corresponds in one leap year 12 with the last day of the year only in another leap year 24 with the first day only and in two common years 7 and 18 being the third and second after leap year with both the first and last day but it is in years 1 and 29 alone that all the conditions of the Julian Year become exactly alike Thus after a lapse of 28 entire years of which the  21 common years contain  7665 days or exactly  1095 weeks and the    7 leap years contain   2562 days or exactly  366 weeks making in all  28 years or    0 10227 days or     1461 weeks between the first days of January in the years 1 and 29 both of these years being the first after bissextile SATURDAY returns to be the first and also the last day of the year In the years 30 31 32 c downi to 57 all the days of the week will recur in the same order as in 2 3 4 down to 29 at the beginning and end of years having a common re lation with leap year and so onfor ever VOL xY28110 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR The rule of the Tablet is therefore perfectly consonant with the wellknown law of the Solar Cycle and Dominical Letters in the Julian Calendar and it is evident to the mere arithmetician that the part which the Equation 5 plays in the type or first cycle of that Calendar just exhibited at large in connexion with the initial and final day of the year would be equally well performed by it in conjunction with any intermediate ordinal day of those years or with any other Old Style year without limiitation But thus far we have not considered the year as divided into months and days of the month both of which are embraced as elements of computation in our general rule On carrying out the plan of the foregoing Table and introducing every month it will be seen that the first days of each month are equivalent to the following ordinals of thle commnon year placed in the upper line of SERIES IIFirst Days of the Months Months    Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sep Oct

as the usual tabular index to the Dominical Letters constitute Table B of the Perpetual Calendar They are called Nos for the respective months and on being substituted for the corresponding ordinals of the year standing in the upper line will when the first day of the month comes to be added with them to tlle year and the constant 5 yield the very same remainders and so indicate correctly the day of the week on which each month of the first year of the Christian Era begins 0 the monthly number for January marks the true zero of the civil year or the mid night between the old and the new year and this No added to the day of the monthl equals throughout January the ordinal day of the year The rest of the monthly Nos mark the midnights preceding the first day of each subsequent month expressed in the odd days over full weeks counted from the same zeropoint and this distance together with the days of each month in succession must of course equal the other ordinals throughout the year But since the rejection of entire weeks or division by 7 does not affect the day of the week the sum of the monthly No and the day of the month may be substituted uniformly for those ordinals Thus the 31st of December whose monthly No is 5 added to the year 1 its fourth part 0 and the constant 5  42 which sum divided by 7 gives us 0 or Saturday the same result as when calling it the 365th day in SERIES I Either an additional year or an additional day of the month or an additional 29th of February in every fourth year advances by 1 the day of the week as regularly and per manently through an infinite succession of weekly cycles as we have already found them to do in the computations connected with that series in which 0 the No for Januarv with 1 the day of the month might have been ulsed as equivalent to 1 the day of the year9MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR Ill It is demonstrated therefore that the use of Dominical Letters whether single or dou ble may lie entirely dispensed with in the Julian Calendar The Solar Equation or Con stant 5 standing at the head of column A effects for ever with the aid of Table B by a process almost purely additive the same object in a simpler and easier way and supplies the place not only of the whole apparatus of Regulars and Concurrents heretofore coin bined with the Solar Cycle but also of the memorial lines usually employed for ascertain ina the first day of every month in a manner which was not however readily applicable when the year happened to begin on any other day than Sunday It may not be unwor thy of a passing notice that regarding the solar regulars one and eight as the same each of the twelve monthly numbers of Table B viz 0 3 3 6 1 4 6 2 5 0 3 5 is less by 2 than each of the ancient Solar Regulars 2 5 5 1 3 6 1 4 7 2 5 7 and is less by 1 than the respective numbers    1 4 4 7 2 5 7 3 6 1 4 6 representing the order in the alphabet of the initials AD D G B E G C F A D F of the twelve words composing the doggerel rhyme which we have just referred to namely At Dover Dwell George Brown Esquire Good Christopher Finch And David Friar From the Constant 5 thus perfectly established as a starting point is readily deduced the retreating series of small secular equations whichi follow it in the same column and these will in turn answer equally well for finding the day of the week belonging to any lay of any inonth in any year throughout the Gregoorian Era For the first step in the reformation of the Juliani Calendar in 1582 taken for the purpose of restoring the equi noxes to their former place in the year consisted in the suppression of 10 days in that year by calling the day which was the fifth of October in the Old Style the 15th of October in the New On applying the Rule given in the Tablet the Julian 5th of Octo ber 1582 will be shown by the Remainder 6 to have been Friday but the Julian 15tlh of October being a week and three days farther on would by the same rule be found to happen on Monday Now the series of days of the week was not interrupted nor intended to be by the reform The days of the month only were to be differently named after 10 of them should be expunged The epoclh day or point of time called in the Julian Calendar the 5th of October must continue to be Friday in the Gregorian and be re ferred to as the 6th day of the week whatever new denomination it might receive as a day of the month In order then to make the 15th of October in the New Style corre spond with Friday it is obvious that we must go back three days in the calculation or in other words that from the Julian Solar or rather Hebdomadal Equation of   must be deducted the excess over a full week of the 10 days lost or and that thenceforward duringr a certain period the Gregorian solar correction or equation must be which number stands opposite in Column A to the first centurial figures namely to 15 and 16 This equation 2 would for ever perform the same office in the Gregorian that 5 had done and still does in the Julian Calendar but for a second step taken at the Refornmation With a view to prevent in future that deviation of the nominal civil Days fromn the defi nite Seasons of the year which had arisen from introducing too many leap years it was then determined thlat after 1600 which continued hissextile in bothl Calendars every sue112 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR ceeding hundredth year whose centurial figures were not divisible by 4 without a remain der should cease to be leap years but that every 400th year whose centurial figures were nultiples of 4 slhould continue to be leap years These multiples 16 20 24 c are accordingly all marked on the Civil side of the Caleindar with asterisks but the interme diate centurial figures 17 18 19 and 21 22 23 c on the same side are left unmarked Now whenever an asterisk occurs no change takes place in the solar equation but at each of the three other centurial figures that equation is diminished by a unit on account of the one day lost at each successive nonintercalation of the 29th of February The equation 2 beside 15 continues of course to be 2 at 16 Frorm 16 downwards the equa tions limnited by the weekly cycle of 7 which number is always represenited by 0 in column A fall into sets offoutr each in a receding series each new set of four beginning wvith the samne figure with which the last set ended and 2 followed by 2 reappears at the centurial figures 43 44 c and at 71 72 c thus returning after four titmes seven or twentyeight centuries to

tlhree items viz the given year its fourth part and the secular correction in column A forms a standing number which being once obtained and noted on New Years day iiay serve a conivenient purpose throughout that year This Remainder is universally the complement to 8 of the Dominical number for the year and might be called the Yearly Number Then supposing the Monthly Numbers well fixed in the memory a task which the division of Table B into a thicklined polygon resembling a carpenters square containing twice 3 6 0 and a tlhicklined square containing a 5 leaving an interval composed of

Monthly No and the Day of the Month and rejecting the sevens from their sum Since this sum never exceeds 43 the whole process may be mentally performed without difficulty after a little practice During the present century whose solar equation is 0 the computation is particularly easy for instance Tthe Renmainder or Yearly No for 1845 to be kept in mind is 1845  461  0  3 Wlhat day of the week

exceptions respecting January and February must of course be attended to Those exceptions might instead of referring to the preceding day of the week have been equally well provided for by the following direction viz In January and February of leap Years use the monthly nuvmbers of July and August in each case six months distatntMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 113 The solar equation belonging to any Gregorian century beyond the limits of the Tablet might be found by numbering from 0 to 28 the equations in Column A opposite to the centurial figures Iying between 28 and 56 For since the secular corrections recur in like order at every succeeding period of four times seven centuries that equation to which the Remiainder on dividing the given centurial figures by 28 stood attached would be the Equation required which may likewise be obtained without the use of tables by a short rule given hereafter near the close of the mnemoir I proceed to explain as briefly as possible the construction of the Ecclesiastical side of the Calendar and the means I adopted soon after the civil side had been completed of connecting them with each other thus making two of the monthly numbers in Table B namely 3 and 6 still representing March and April contribute towards shorteninig the calculations respecting Easter and causing also a single additional Column C to serve as a convenient substitute for an extended table of thirty lines of Epacts indexed wvith as many alplhabetical letters great and small and consisting of nineteen numbers in eacl line Aided by Mr Galloways article before referred to and by one of Lord Macclesfields published in the Philosophical Transactions of 1750 No 494 page 417 I fourld tlle task less difficult than I had anticipated They describe the ingenious but involved and intricate mode of expressing in the Church Calendar successive differences between Solar and Ltunar years by mearns of Epacts or Ineremnents These Epacts are so derived fronm the Golden Numbers that is fromn the order in which the years stanld in the Metonic cycle of 19 years as to indicate the age at the beginning of each year of an imaginary rnoon whose artificial phases though approaching seldom correspond with but are genlerally a day or two in advance of the mean movements of the true moon They state that supposing the Epact of the year 1 to be 11 that is the difference betweeni the common Solar year of 365 days and the Lunar year of 354 days the Epact of each following year of the first cycle of 19 is obtained by adding 11 to that of the former year and by rejecting 30 as often as the suim exceeds 30 but that at the 20th 39th 58th 77tll c years viz at the beginnings of each succeeding cycle 12 is to be added to the epact of the last year of each preceding cycle and continued augmentations of 11 and rejections of 30 are to take place as before Hence I inferred that the Golden Numbers as Remnain ders on division by 19 of the year plus 1 might be dispensed with anid their place in conmputation be conveniently supplied by adding to 11 times tlle year the 19th part of the year used as a quotient or whole Number taking care only that when the Julian year hiappens to be a nmultiple of 19 one less than the 19th parE shall be added This easy formula yielded me without a failure the constanitly recurring 19 Epacts that mark the ancient calendar beginning with 11 and ending their round with 29 and the General Rule at the head of my Tablet as there modified is precisely an equivalent for it but provides at the same time a practical advantage in the arrangemient of the figures The omission of fractions advances by 1 in the order prescribed each successive set or cycle of Epacts while the exception stated guards effectually against the intercalation of 1 taking place at any earlier date than the proper cycle just as in the Civil Calendar 1 less than one4th part of the year is added in January and February of leap years The reason vOL X 29114 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR is the same also for omitting the fractions occurring between multiples of 19 in the Church Calendar as those occurring between multiples of 4 in the Civil With a view to demonstrate without a large array of figures the consistency of mly Rule with wellestablished tabular modes of finding the Epact I refer to the extended Table of Epacts in the Encyclopedia Britannica article  Calendar page 12 where in line c beginning with 11 will be found all the Julian Epacts under a Golden Number how ever always one behind or one less than that which was originally assigned to the year A D 1 was in the old Calendar always regarded as year 2 of the cycle of 19 rrhis relation between the Golden Numbers and the Epacts was changed at the reformation when the line D beginning with 1 was selected for the Gregorian Epacts between the years 1582 and 1699 inclusive and the         Epacts 1 12 23 4 c were made to correspond withl the Golden Numbers     1 2 3 4 c The Julian Epact for 1582 found by my Rule and confirmed by the elaborate chrono logical Table contained in  The Art of Verifying Dates a work of great learning and acknowledged authority is 25 the same that is presented in the line c of thie extended Table of Epacts under the Golden Number 5 that of the Julian year being 6 De scending ten places in that column on account of the ten days suppressed at the reform or what comes to the same thing deducting from the Julian Epact of 25 the number of days suppressed or    10 we reach or obtain  15 But the advance of one Golden Number in the line D is equivalent to the addition of 11 and thus causes the Gregorian Epact for 1582 to be           26 for 1583 to be 7 for 1584 to be 18 and so on that is to say makes it always greater by 1 than the Julian until 1700 unless the years be multiples of 19 in which case the Julian Epact as the Exception provides will become always 29 and the Gregorian will be 1 The 15 in the transition from one style to the other is not an Epact of the year in either but a connecting link between the two The Gregorian Epact at that epoch is in reality greater by a unit than the Julian and the Julian Equation standing at the head of Column C in my Tablet being 0 for ever the proper startingpoint for the Gre gorian Equations is 1 which number accordingly stands at the right hand of the centurial figures 15 and 16 The succeeding Lunisolar equations 0 29 28 c were reached in the following manner Lord Macclesfields directions for determining  in what years the Epacts should either be extraordiinarily augmented or diminished and the Golden Numbers should either be set backwards or forwards in the Calendar according to the divisibility of the even hun dreds by 3 or by 4 separately or by both 3 and 4 or by neither led me to the expedient similar to the one I had already adopted in regard to the secular equations in the Civil Calendar of marking with an asterisk in strict obedience to the Gregorian law every centurial figure at which in successive periods of 25 centuries beginning at 1800 4300 6800 c the Epact is to be increased by a unit This correction occurs at the end of every 300 years 7 times in succession and then once at the end of 400 years making 8 corrections in the course of 2500 yearsMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 115 The mere relative position of these righthand asterisks to those already placed on the left serves to ascertain without calculation the coincidence or otherwise of the prescribed secular adjustments and to indicate at once by a process rather more direct and simple than Lord Macclesfields the joint effect upon the Calendar Moons Age of the omission three times in every 400 years of a 29th of February on the one hand and of the addition eight times in every 2500 years of an extraEpact on the other For it is obvious with reference to the normal bissextile intercalation of the Julian Calendar and to its recurring Epacts which depend upon the Golden Nos and are through them connected with the Gregorian Epacts by a definite law both of analogy and deviation that on the left an asterisk means deduct nothing a blank means deduct one day and that on the right an asterisk means add one day a blank means add nothing NOW havingr at the Cent Figs 15 and l6as afixed point of departure theEquationlt if at 17 we deduct 1 and add 0 it falls to 0 or 30 if at 18  1  1 it remains 0 if at 19  1  0 it falls to 29 if at 20  0  0 it remains 29 if at 21  1  1 it remains 29 if at 22  1  0 it falls to 28 if at 23  1  0 it falls to 27 if at 24  0  1 it rises to 28 if at 25  1  0 falls again to 27 if at 26  1  0 it falls to 26 c WHENCE we draw the following general and almost mechanical Rule for obtaining the whole series of Luinisolar Equations in Column C viz Descending from century to century in the central Column of Gregorian Eras Keep the Equation the samie as before when a single  occurs on either side Diminish the last equation by 1 when the asterisk appears on neither side And increase the last equation by 1 when the   appear on both sides but limiting of course this generally but not uniformly receding series by the cycle of 30 or 0 In this manner is readily produced a succession of suitable Epacts susceptible of indefinite extension and requirinig no supplementary precepts such as Lord Maccles field conceived would become necessary after the year 4199 Before that distant age arrives the Civil Calendar will doubtless undergo the slight modification generally recommended bv modern astronomers of omitting a single bis sextile intercalation at every 4000th year which would maintain an almost perfect ac cordance between the seasons and the beginnings of the year for a thousand centuries to come and the Ecclesiastical Calendar also will most probably receive cotemporaneously t Although the Equation 1 on the right of the Centurial figures 16 results necessarily from the arbitrary appropriation of the Epact 26 with the Golden Number 6 to the first year of the Reformed Calendar and does not depend upon but is the same with the preceding Equation it nevertheless happens in consequence of no leap year being suppressed until 1700 and of no Epact being added until 1800 to obey the general law of the asterisks as expressed in the text116 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR some new adjustment But pursuing without regard to future reforms of either Calendar the plan I have just described as far as the 87th centurial figures and comparing at every step the results derived from my General Rule when applying the successive equa tions so obtained with the Epacts set down in the extended Tables I found them to be in exact correspondence with each other line by line and letter by letter throughout the cir cuit from little a to capital P In fact the equations in Column C are identical with the figures which stand in the first column of Table II Encyclop Brit Art Cialendar under the Golden Number 1 and imnmediately by the side of the 30 letters running up the column from D to C Delambre pronounces the Epactletters useless I trust therefore that for discarding them in company with the Domibical from my Tablet I shall not incur the reproach of being hostile to Letters in general The Gregorian Annual Epact being thus accessible with very little nmore trouble than the ordinary process of finding the Golden Number since three out of the four lines of figures to be added together require no computation but merely to be set down on paper in the order stated it remains for me to elucidate my mode of deducing from the Epact the Paschal Term or the 14th day of the Paschal Moon most commonly but improperly called  The Paschal FullMoon on which Easter Sunday depends The Paschal Moon is that whose 14th day counting the new imoon as the first never falls earlier than the 21st of March nor later than the 18th of April reckoning tlle calendar lunations of those months respectively to contain 30 and 29 days for Easter according to the usage of the western churches of the Roman empire sanctioned by the Council of Nice must be celebrated on a Sunday which Sunday mustfollowv the 14th day of the Paschal Moon so that whenever the Paschal 14th or Term fell on Sunday Easter could not arrive until the next Sunday If the Term fell on Saturday Easter came one day after that Saturday viz on the next day consequently the interval between the Pas chal rerim and Easter might be 7 days but could never be less tlhan one day and since the Term could not happen before the CalendarVernal Equinox which whatever might be the astrononoical fact was by the Church invariably fixed on the 21st of March Easter Sunday it is clear must have its place between the 22d of March and the 25th of April both days inclusive Now supposing the 14th day of the Paschal Mloon to coincide with the Calendar Equinox that moon must have been new or in its first day on the 8th of March for 21 less 13 is 8 and the preceding mnoon must have been 23 days old on the 1st of March just a week earlier for 8 less 7 equals 1 That is to say the mnoon on the 1st day of March nust have been of exactly the samie age as it was on the 1st of January the in terval between those days in common years being two lunations one of 30 the other of 29 days or 59 days in all The Epacts belonging to January and March are of course identical as they are seen to be in every Epact Alnmanac and it is manifest that when the CalendarMoons age on the first day of the year exceeds 23 days in which case the new moon of March would happen before the 8th and its 14th day consequently before the Equinox the Paschal New Moont will be in April and wlhen 23 or less will happen in MarchMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 117 If then the Paschal Term occurs on the 21st of March the Annual Epact is 23 if on the 22d  it is 22 if on the 23d  it is 21 and so on up    to the 31st  and down to the Epact 13 the day of the month rising by one as regularly as the Epact descends by one so that their sum is always the same      viz 44 and the Paschal Term in March must of course be that number less the Epact Advancing with the Day of the Month to the 1st of April we descend to the Epact 12 to the 2d 4 to 11 to the 3d 4 to 10 and so on up    to the 12th  and down to the Epact 1 the sumn being always    13 and the Paschal Term in that part of April which precedes the 13th is 13 less the Epact Arriving in like manner at the 13th of April we have the Epact 0 or 30 at the 14thl  29 at the 15th  28 and so on up     to the 18th  and down to the Epact 25 the sumi being always       43 and the Paschal Term for the rest of April is 43 or 30  13 less the Epact subject however to two exceptions in the case of the double Epacts 2526 and 2524 The Gregorian Calendar of Epacts see Table III Encyclop Brit Art  Calendar has been so constructed that the Epact 25 belongs whenever the Golden Number exceeds 11 to the same day with the Epact 26 and is then marked with an accent to distinguish it Now since 43 less 26 gives the 17th day of April as the proper Paschal Term or limit 25 in order to produce the same result must be subtracted from 42 By a like contrivance the Epact 25 not accented belongs wlhen the Golden Number does not exceed 11 to the samne day with the Epact 24 and since 43 less 25 yields the 18th of April as the proper Pasehal Term or Limit 24 in order to produce the same result must likewise be subtracted fron    42 In this manner both the exceptions are readily provided for with a single diminuend 42 3 This artifice employed in the construction of the Table of Gregorian Epacts by makinig the age of the mooln to differ occasionally a day more from the truth than it would otherwise have done preserves betweeln the Old and New Calendars a certain conventional resemblance which consists in the nonrepetition of a given annual epact within the same lunar cycle For the reason of this arbitrary mode of writing the epacts and of varying consequently the Paschal Term I must refer to regular treatises on the subject remarking only that this device of Clavius to which I have adjusted the operation of my own does by no means prevent in either style Easter Sunday from falling repeatedly in the course of any single cycle of 19 years twice and sometimes thrice on the same day of the month In the last lunar cycle for instance ending with 1843 the New Style Easter occurred thrice on the 3d day of April and in duplicate four times on other days of the month In the present cycle ending in 1862 like duplicate Easters on certain days of the month will happen six times In the course of the very first cycle of the reform at Rome similar coincidences took place three times in New Style and would have done so seven times in Old Style if the Julian mode of reckoniing had not been abandoned VOL x30118 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR The Golden Number being the remainder after division by 19 of the year plus 1 the excess of 10 where the year itsef is to be divided by 19 agreeably to my rule becomes an equivalent expression for the excess of 11 in the tables referred to It will be perceived that the Gregorian Epacts in Table D of my Tablet are merely arranged in sets or sequences in a more orderly manner beginning at 1 and ending at 30 than they presented themselves in the course of the foregoing explanations and that the short column of four numbers from which they are according to their several places in the series to be deducted namely 13 44 43 and 42 assumes at the same time greater symmetry The difference between those numbers and the Epact can never in April exceed 18 but whenever the 14th day of the Paschal Moon falls on the 18th day of that month and happens at the same tinme to be Sunday Easter Sunday must be a week later or the 25th of April It must always be at least one day after the Paschal Trerm but whether it is to be celebrated one or seven or any intermediate number of days after that term will always be correctly determined when the day of the week on which the term occurs has been found by the Civil Calendar It is obvious that the number of days to be counted forwards must be the difference between 8 and the number which indicates the day of tlle week Before the close of tlhe past year I had prepared in manuscript a specimen of the Perpetual Calendar described in the foregoing pages and had solved by means of it numerous chronological questions trying uniformly the correctness of my results by the tables and forinulw of Lord Macclesfield and Mr Galloway when I learned from the Journal of the Franklin Institute for November that the next Britislh Almanac and Com panion would contain an Article from the pen of Mr Augustus De Morgan of University College London on the subject of a controversy not unlikely to arise respecting the proper day of celebrating Easter in 1845 My rules gave me as the Tablet shows the 23d of March but being naturally desirous of testing their accuracy in that as well as other instances by such distinguished mathematical authority I awaited the receipt of a copy of that instructive Annual which a friend had ordered from England and which he kindly placed in my hands in the course of the winter As it embraced what I had anti cipated a very learned interesting full and satisfactory Essay on the Ecclesiastical Calendar I could not but be highly gratified at finding my rules confirmed by every example therein computed and more especially by the discovery that owing to the mechanism of my Tablet which spared me the labour of several arithmetical steps which Mr De Morgan who proposed to himself and has ably executed the more difficult task of pure calculation according to Delambres analytical formule and independent of all tabulation had been compelled under the assigned limits of his problemn to take I was enabled to attain in mouch less time by rules occupying less space and requiring less mental and manual effort the same results with those yielded by his fifteen 1 slhort arith mietical directions given at pages  5 and 16 It appeared to me besides that the risk of error was considerably lessened in my process by the operations consisting for the most part either of the mere setting down or of the addition of figures these figures beingMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 119 in two of the items equations obtained at a single inspection and in three other items the year itsef It is for others however to decide and I should most cheerfully submit the question to the two abovenamed eminent living authorities on whom I have relied whether the Tablet which I now present to the Society as a new  method professing only to combine very condensed tables with plain rules may not possess a sufficient degree of practical utility to deserve publication Intent upon rendering the Tablet useful in calculations relating principally to the New Style I should not have thought of embracing in it the ancient Church Calendar now gone into disuse in almost every part of the Christian world except the empire of Russia had I not mnet with the  very simple Table given by Mr De Morgan at page 32 and which he says  will supply the place of all rules as soon as the Golden Number and Domi nical Letter are known Now since it has been steadily my aim to eliminate both those portions of the scaffolding of the Calendar my work seemed incomplete unless I could still dispense with them and could devise some other means at least as easy in practice as the ten rules placed by Mr De Morgan on the subsequent page for determining the Old Style Easter I sought in vain for a copy of Clavius in the public libraries of the United States but was fortunate enough to find in the Library of this Society  The Art of Verifying Dates LArt de verifier les dates troisibme edition par un religieux Benedictin de la congregation de St Maur Tome premier a Paris 1783 whose very extensive Tables assisted greatly the accomplishment of my object The  Chronological Table and the  Perpetual Lunar Calendar both clearly exhibit the same constant concurrence between the Paschal 14th of the Moon and the place of the year in the cycle of 19 which is men tioned by Mr De Morgan and shown in his Table We have therefore only to translate into their corresponding Epacts the several Golden Numbers in the order in which they there stand and we shall obtain a series of 19 Julian Epacts descending while the days of the month rise as we before witnessed in the case of the Gregorian Calendar with this difference in the exposition that blanks are left at each of the ten places between the 21st of March and the 18th of April where there is no golden number and where there can be no Epact since the numbers wanting to complete a regular series viz 13 10 8 5 2 30 27 24 21 and 19 as well as 16 had no existence as Epacts in the Ancient Calendar The Epact 29 forms a case by itself on account of the peculiar interval of 12 between it and the succeeding Epact 11 In the Reformed Calendar the interval of 12 always precedes the Epact belonging to every year which is a multiple of 19 But if the Julian XXIX be treated like the Gregorian 0 or XXX and be made to change places with 30 it ceases to appear anomalous Compare the following columns with those at page 117 of this memoir The leading Epact there was 23 and is here 15  There is one I have since learned in the Library of

length of Civil months in all Leap Years as well as that of artificial Lunations in the existing Church Calendar and that the 13th and 5th were the days of the month on which the Ides and Nones in every month but four of the old Roman Calendar began It is of more importance however to state that having procured in April last through the politeness of Professor E Otis Kendall from the Library of the High School of Phila delphia the use of Delanmbres History of Modern Astronomy I have since then calcu lated according to my Tablet every example given in Book I on the reformation of the Calendar including the extreme cases put by Delambre to illustrate his principles in the controversy with Ciccolini about the relative merits of their respective formuke and that I have found my results not only to correspond uniformly with those which are there computed but to be reached much more expeditiously also than by the processes there employed I have moreover been prompted by curiosity as well as by caution to extend my secular corrections as far as Delambre had pursued his in the Connoissance des Tems for 1817 and to carry down accordingly with the mechanism of the asterisks my equations in Columns A and C to the 500th century I compared as I proceeded a few cases at various epochs and many near the termination of mny task with the answers contained in his beautiful  Table Pascale at page 43 Book I Astron Moderne where the Gregorian Easters are obtained by inspection after the Dominical Letter and Epact are known and I had the pleasure to find in every instance the results still identical Without doubting for a moment or presuming to call in question the correctness of the principles on which that Paschal Table has been constructed I feel itnevertheless incumnbent on me to remark that from the text of Delambre at page 24 it would appear that Claviuss Great Table which is almost universally consulted as a standard differs from Delambres smnall one by incltuding amnong the years in which Easter happens on the 22d of March the year 3860 According to Delambres formule and Paschal Table the Dominical Letter being G and the Epact 24 it will fall on the 22d of April according to Gausss formula M beincg 2 and N being 5 on the same day by the tables of Lord Macclesfield and Mr Galloway the Golden Number being 4 and the Domninical Letter G on the same day and finally by Mr De Morgans Ruiles and by my own on the same day that is on the 22d of April With such a preponderance of concurrent testimony in favour of the conclusion at which I arrive I cannot but suppose that Claius VOL N31122 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR must either be in error or that the month has been by some inadvertence misquoted from his rrable by Delamrbre The day or quanti6me of the mnonth is the same according to all the mathematicians thus far named and the month must be April for the 22d of March corresponds with Thursday and not with Sunday in that year and the Paschal New Moon cannot happen in March wlhen the Epact exceeds 23 It seems no less unaccountable that Sir Harris Nicolas who gratefully acknowledges some assistance from Mr De Morgan when preparing his  Chronology of History published in 1833 in Lardners Cabinet Cyclopedia should imake the Easter of 3860 by the NUMBER OF DIRECTION in hiis Table H to be the 15th of Apriljust a week earlier than my instructors have computed it and yet not agreeing with Claviuss decision as before reported I shall be glad if the pointing out of this strange discrepancy should lead to the removal of a radical error existing somewhere and as I believe in Vinces ComIplete System of Astronomy vol 1 page 581 in Fergusons Astronomy and in Reess Cyclopedia Article  Cycle in all of whiclh as well as

in regard to the Easter day of every year having the Golden Numlber 14 or Epact 24 between 1590 and 1685 both inclusive and it is equally true that Delambres formule do not authenti cate the Easters of any year having the Golden Number 4 or Epact 24 from 3803 to 3898 both inclusive as calculated by Sir H Nicolass Table H In these last cases the deviation varies from one to two weeks in the former it amounts always to four weeks The learned Benedictine of St Maur who between the first and third edition of  The Art of Verifying Dates discovered the means of reducing his i Perpetual Solar

the sum of the two Quotients increased if needful by 7 deduct the Remnainder The Difference rejecting the sevens if any will be the Equation wantedA But since the final rejection of the sevens is provided for by the Rule of the Tablet the Difference itself will answer every purpose of that Equation Rules for finding the New Style Lunisolar Equation of Column C until A D 1899 inclusive Divide the Centurial figures by botlh 3 and 4 and to the two Quotients add 8 From the Sum deduct the Centurial figures the Difference will be the Equation wanted From A D 1899 to A D 4199 both inclusive Divide the Centurial figures by both 3 and 4 and to the two Quotients add 8 From the Centurial figures deduct the Sum Then take the Difference from the next higher multiple of 30 which during this period is always 30 and the Second Difference will be the Equation wanted At and after A D 4200for ever The rule is the same as the last with this Exception only viz that the Centurial figures must be diminished by C 17 4 C 68 that is to say by the Quotient arising from the division of  four tilmes the Centurial figures  less 68 by 100 before being divided by 3 but they must be used in the rest of the work exactly in the manner there directed The following results of the Rule and Tablet will be found in perfect accordance with those derived from Delambres formule and Paschal Table in determining Easter for A D 50000 The Solar Equation of Column A  3 and Lunisolar Equation of Column C  3 The Dominical Letters are B and A and the Epact is 4 The 14th day of the Paschal Moon will fall on Sunday the 9th of April and Easter of course on the following Sunday viz the 16th of April A collateral proof of the correctness of these secular equations is derived from the fact lately observed by me that the same mechanical expedient of the asterisks furnishes instantly all the Gregorian Corrections M and N of Gausss formula beginning with 22 and 2 but in advancing series the reverse of mine as given by M Le Chevalier de Gresy in Vol XXIV page 77 of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Turin124 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR SUPPLEMENT TO MR McILVAINES MEMOIR Read December 18th 1846 WHEN constructing the  New Perpetual Calendar which I had the honour of present ing to the Society last year I purposely avoided furnishing any rule for the Era before Christ lest the requisite explanations in regard to leap years which for that period are so expressed by chronologists as never to be multiples of 4 might unduly extend or complicate the Tablet Since its publication however in the Quarterly Bulletin where it appears in a reduced form with the Examples conveniently separated from the Rules I have been led to believe that without exceeding the limits of a single page in the next volume of the Transactions at large the ist of the annexed Supplemental Rules might readily be subjoined to it and thus render the plan applicable to all Time The Rule is a mere corollary from the general principles of the Tablet for after AD 1 the numbers of the two series 1 29 57 c and 1 20 39 c see pages 109 and 118 never again coincide until A D 533 1065 1597 c each of which years like A D 1 is the first after leap year begins and ends on Sat and has the same Epact 11 Reversing the order of timne the chronol year 1 B C or astron year 0 is the 28th of the Solar and 19th of the Lunar cycle next preceding A D 1 It is a leap year begins on Th ends on F has the Epact 29 and corresponds with A D 532 The chronol year 2 BC or the astron year 1 is the 27th of the Solar and 18th of the Lunar Cycle next preceding A D 1 It is the third after leap year begins and ends on W has the Epact 18 and corresponds witlh A D 531 and so backwards without limit throuigh all the combinations of Old Style cycles concurring at regular intervals of 532 entire years I have added a convenient Rule the 2d for years of the Julian Period a 3d Rule witl formula to serve as proofs also a simple method Rule 4th of solving converse problems wlhich though more curious perhaps than useful I beg leave to append to the memoir I was recently mnuch gratified by learning from Mr Galloway and Mr De Morgan who have at my request had the goodness to consult for me the fifth volume of Claviuss mathe matical works and to furnish me with a few particulars froin the explication there given of the Reformed Roman Calendar that my conjecture respecting the discrepancy in a single case between my results and those set down in the great Table of Clavius as well as in the text of Delambre turns out to be correct On tracing the difference to its source it appears that the Table and the text are alike erroneous but accidentally so The substance of the communications with which I have been honoured on the point in question is this In the Table there is an  obvious misprint at the angle where the line belonging to the year 3860 meets the column of Easters in which column the montlhs of March and April are not otherwise distinguished than by their initial letters M and A The Easter for that year  stands 22 M but ought to be 22 A for in the same line and in nearly adjoining columns on the left the Paschal full moon is made to fall I18d 18 A the Paschal 14th is made  18 A and all the moveable feasts accord with those of an Easter that occurs on the 22d day of April Moreover in the column inmmediately on the right stands  Pentecost 10 June which is absurd when Easter is any where in March and renders the fact more strange that Delambre should have  missed seeing the errorMEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR 125 SUPPLEMENTAL RULES EXTENDING AND FACILITATING THE USE OF THE FOREGOING TABLET 1st A Rule for Julian Years before Christ back to the remotest

days It so happens therefore that in both these cases the Julian and Gregorian Easters will be celebrated on the very same day The year 2698 is the last according to Mr De Morgan in which such a coincidence will occur See note at the foot of page 19 in his Essay on the Ecclesiastical Calendar See also page 105 of this Memoir The Rule for the Gregorian Epact it will be perceived becomes universally the following To 11 times the Cyclic No add the Equation in Colunmn C and reject 30sfrom theSum The Rule for the Feria or day of the week though not attended with an equal eco nomy of Figures suggests the practical convenience of marking for remembrance in any current century those years which terminate cycles of 28 such as 1820 1848 and 1876 in the present century in which case the Cyclic No for aniy intermediate year may be promptly known and the day of the week be thence deduced by an easy mental process For instance the Cyclic No for 1847 is 27 or 27 years beyond 1820 and the other figures to be added to it are so few and small that ordinary questions may be solved by the Ruile without putting pen to paper more especially in the present century whose secular equations are on both sides of the Tablet null until 1900 A similar expedient might be adopted with the years 1805 1824 1843 1862 1881 each ending cycles of 19 and the Epacts for intermediate years be mentally computed with like facility Thus the Cyclic No for 1847 is 4 or four years beyond 1843 and the Epact is 14 or 4 times 11 lessened by 30 Without departing however from the original form of the Tablet the work may be somewhat abbreviated by noting those years only which close at once centuries and cycles such as 14001800 c on one side and 1900 3800 c on the other and by using in computation the years beyond those epochs respectively Thus 447 448 c yield the same feriw as A D 1847 1848 c and in the coming century 1 2 3 c will yield the same Epacts as A D 1901 1902 c 4th A Rulefor the Solution by theforegoing Tablet of Converse Questions viz To find on what day of the Alonth a given Day of the Week first falls in any Alonth in any year Omit the day of the Month in the fifth line and divide the Sum of the four dther lines by 7 Subtract the Remainder from the numerical Day of the Week increased if needful by 7 The Difference will be the ANSWER But in January and February of Leap Year take theRemainder from the succeedingdayofthe Week increasedifneedfulin like manner EXAMPLES What Day of the Mlonth was thefirst Monday in Dec 1846 the day of the meeting of Congress The Remainder by the

in Feb 1844 being a Leap Year The Remainder bv the above Rule will be 5 5 taken from 6 Friday leaves for the answer 1 or thefirst day of that Montlh I See De Morgans Essay page 16 Example 2d NOTEAny reference in Leap Years either to preceding or succeeding Days of the Week in January and February may be avoided by substituting the Monthly No of July for January and that of August for February each No being half a year distant from that which it takes the place of In the last example for instance had the August No 2 been used instead of the February No 3 the Remainder wouild have been 4 which taken from Thursday or 5 would have given the same result128 MEMOIR EXPLANATORY OF A NEW PERPETUAL CALENDAR APPENDIX TO MR McILVAINES MEMOIR Read July 16th 1847 I beg the Societys acceptance of the accompanying Cards containing a new plan of a Perpetual Civil Calendar c in which still dispensing with Dominical Letters and substituting for them Yearly Numbers always their complement to 8 if we read 0 as equal to 7 the same results may be obtained by mere inspection as those requiring com putation according to the scheme heretofore presented by me The equivalence of the two methods will be readily recogniised by the following comparison of them which is unliversally applicable The Yearly Number by the former plan would be the Remainder on division by 7 of the Sum of the Year its fourtlh part omitting fractions and the secular Equation in Column A whiich Remainder for the New Style year 1847 after Christ is 5 the same as the Yearly Nunmber here standing in Table C at the intersection of the line of A with the column of B rhe same line be it observed answers for a whole century Now for the names of the months of Table E in this plan substitute the Monthly Numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 of Table B in the former and the two processes become virtually identical thus The 18th of June 1847 found by the former would be5  4  18 27r 6 orFriday By the present counting 5 onwards from 18 in Table C we reach a column containing 23 then descending the column to Table E we find in the line of June the Day of the Week to be Friday corresponding with the Remnainder 6 If in the blank space between the Examples and Table E and in line witlh the respective months their seven monthly num bers were so arranged as to form a short column it would perhaps be more clearly seen how and why the relative position of the several Tables of page 129 effects the same object as the Rule on the Civil side of the Perpetual Calendar at page 106 I have given no examples of New Style years either before the Christian Era or between it and the year 1582 because that mode of reckoning though well calculated to reveal and to measure approximately the chief defect of the Julian Calendar is not cus tomary in chroniology and being somewhat speculative might perplex rather than assist an inquirer but in Old Style years before Christ and in New Style years until the Gre gorian reckoning shall be modified the wide range of these five Tables may be very satis factorily shown by two of the examples which have been already worked in a different nmanner namely the 1st of January in the astronomical year 6857 B C at page 125 and the 16th of April A D50000 at page 123 Both their centurial figures lie beyond the limits of Table A but 68 yielding on division by 7 the Remainder 5 belongs to the same line with 5 os BC and 500 yielding on division by 4 the Remainder 0 belongs to the same line with 16 NS AC Trhe Yearly Number in the first case using agree ably to the 2d Exception 43 instead of 57 in Table B is 1 and the answer is Monday The Yearly Number in the second case is 0 and the answer is Sunday This device is accordingly verified by the formule of Delambre to the samne

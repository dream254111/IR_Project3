OF CARLISLE TO DR EDMUND HALLEY L L D SAVILIAN PROFESSOR OF GEOMETRY IN OXFORD AND FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF SOME ANTIQUITIES LATELY SOUND AT CORBRIDGE IN NOR THUMBERLAND S I R S O M E YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN TOWN YOU WERE PLEASED TO DESIRE ME WHEN MY OCCASIONS MIGHT CARRY ME INTO THAT COUNTRY TO GIVE YOU A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE TRUTH OF A RELATION WHICH WAS SENT UP TO THE ATHENIAN SOCIETY OF THE ENTIRE SKELETON OF A PRO DIGIOUS MONSTER OF HUMANE FORM ABOVE 22 FOOT IN LENGTH WHICH WAS DISCOVERD UPON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER TYNE NOT FAR FROM CORBRIDGE IN NORTHUMBERLAND THE RELATION WAS VERY PARTICULAR AND IF IT HAD BEEN TRUE SEEMD TO GO FARTHER TOWARDS A PROOF OF SUCH STU PENDOUS FIGURES IN ANCIENT TIMES THAN ANY OTHER ARGUMENT THAT I HAVE MET WITH UPON THAT SUB JECT LAST SUMMER MY AFFAIRS OBLIGED ME TO STAY THREE OR FOUR DAYS AT CORBRIDGE DURING MY BEING THERE I MADE THE BEST OBSERVATIONS I COULD TO GIVE BOTH MY SELF AND OTHERS SATISFACTION IN AN ACCOUNT OF A MATTER OF FACT WHICH HAD AMUSED THE NATION SO MUCH AS THAT HAD DONE THAT292 THAT I MAY BE MORE EXACT AND SATISFACTORY IN WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER I SHALL GIVE YOU AN ACCOUNT I OF THE PLACE ITSELF AND OF THE ANTIQUITIES THAT ARE THERE II OF THE BONES AND TEETH WHICH ARE DISCOVERED THERE AND SAID TO BE OF SO PRODIGIOUS A BIGNESS III I SHALL OFFER MY THOUGHTS OF THE MATTER WITH SUBMISSION TO YOUR AND OTHER BETTER JUDGMENTS I THE PLACE WHERE THE BONES WERE FOUND IS NOT COR BRIDGE BUT COLCHESTER A MILE WEST OF IT UPON THE N BANKS OF THE RIVER TYNE FORMERLY A ROMAN COLONY BUT AT PRESENT A FIELD OF CORN NOTHING OF ANTIQUITY REMAINING BUT SOME WALLS AND RUBBISH WHICH SHEW IT TO HAVE BEEN A VERY LARGE FORTRESS STONES WHICH HAVE BEEN DUG UP WITH FIGURES AND INSCRIPTIONS UPON THEM HAVE BEEN ALL REMOVD TO CORBRIDGE WHICH HAS RISE OUT OF ITS RUINS THERE I SAW ALTARS INSCRIBD ONE IMP M AVRELIO ANOTHER LEG II AVG COH IIII BUT THAT WHICH IS MOST REMARKABLE IS THAT WHICH STANDS IN A CORNER OF THE CHURCHYARD DE DICATED TO HERCULES IN OLD CAPITAL GREEK CHARACTERS THE LIKE TO WHICH IS NOT TO BE MET WITH I THINK IN ANY OTHER PART OF THIS ISLAND THE CHARACTERS ARE IN DIFFERENT PLAIN AND AS I COULD READ THEM THUS  H P A K  E 1   T  P  W     O  W P    A P  I E P    I E HERCULI TYRIO DIVINA DONA ARCHISACERDOTALIA VEL PER SUMMUM SACERDOTEM OFFERENDA THE ALTAR SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN293 BEEN ERECTED BY SOME OF THE ASIATICK PHAENICIAN AUXILIA RIES WHO MIGHT BE IN GARRISON HERE NEAR THE FRONTIER UNDER URBICUS LOLLIUS IN THE TIME OF M AUR ANTONINUS ABOUT A D 140 THE ALTAR IS VERY LARGE HOLLOW AT THE TOP AS USUAL FOR INCENSE ON THE SIDES ARE IN GRAVD A BULLS HEAD WITH GARLANDS AND SACRIFICING INSTRUMENTS II THE TEETH AND BONES WHICH WERE DISCOVERD BY THE RIVER TYNES BREAKING IN UPON THE BANK WERE FOUND NEAR THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE OLD FORT AND NEITHER HIGHER UP NOR LOWER DOWN THAN THE RUINES OF IT SEEM TO REACH I EXAMIND THE PERSON WHO MADE THE FIRST DISCOVERY AND HAD MONEY FOR PRESENTING SOME OF THE  FROM SOME GENTLEMEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHO IN ALL PROBABILITY GAVE IN THE ACCOUNT AND THEIR QUERIES UPON IT TO THE GENTLEMEN OF THE ATHENIAN SO CIETY AND I WAS AS EXACT AS POSSIBLE IN THE REMARKS WHICH I MADE MY SELF UPON THE SPOT UPON THE WHOLE IT APPEARD TO ME THAT THERE NEVER WAS AN ENTIRE SKE LETON FOUND IN THAT PLACE THE TEETH AND BONES LYE IN THE BANK IN STRATAS SOMETIMES AT ONE SOMETIMES AT TWO YARDS DEPTH FOR ABOVE 200 YARDS IN LENGTH IN SOME PLACES THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A SORT OF PAVEMENT OR FOUNDATION OF STONE WHICH RUNS ALONG WITH THE BONES STRATUM SUPER STRATUM SOMETIMES ABOVE SOMETIMES BELOW THEM THE BONES ARE OF DIFFERENT SIZES THE TEETH WHICH ARE MOST PERFECT AND ENTIRE ARE VERY LARGE SOME THREE OR FOUR INCHES IN COMPASS RIBS SHANKBONES C MANY OF THEM NOT EXCEEDING THE ORDINARY DIMENSIONS OF THOSE OF SHEEP AND OXEN I COULD MEET WITH NO REMAINS OF HORNS THOSE BEING MORE EASILY CORRUPTED THAN THE BONES WHICH ARE OF A HARDER SUBSTANCE THE TEETH LOOK AS IF THEY WERE HU MANE BUT I CANNOT  THEM TO BE SO AND THEY LYE SOMETIMES AT SO GREAT A DISTANCE FROM THE RIBS AND SHANKBONES THAT SHOULD ANY ONE COMPUTE AS I SUP X X POSE294 POSE THE QUERISTS MIGHT DO THE LENGTH OF THE MONSTER FROM ONE TO THE OTHER THEY MIGHT CALCULATE HIS LON GITUDE TO 200 OR 300 YARDS AS REASONABLY AS TO 22 FOOT THE TEETH AND BONES ARE IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT WITH THE HELP OF A LABOURER OR TWO YOU MIGHT IN A FEW HOURS GATHER A BUSHEL OF THEM III FROM THE ACCOUNT I HAVE GIVEN IT MAY NOT BE UNREASONABLE TO INFER THAT THE ALTAR HERE DEDICATED TO THE TYRIAN HERCULES WAS VERY FAMOUS AND MUCH FRE QUENTED THAT OXEN AND SUCH LIKE CREATURES AS BISONS AND BONASSUS WITH WHICH THE COUNTRY HEREABOUTS DID ANCIENTLY ABOUND THE ENTIRE HEAD AND HORNS OF ONE BEING LATELY DUG UP IN A MARSHY GROUND RESEMBLING EXACTLY THOSE CREATURES AS THEY ARE DESCRIBD BY GESNER AND OTHERS WERE SACRIFICED THEREON AND THAT THEIR BONES BEING ALL THROWN TOGETHER AND ACCORDING TO THE SUPERSTITION OF THOSE TIMES LAID UNDER THE FOUN DATION AND PAVEMENT OF THE FORT ARE THE VERY SAME BONES TEETH SKULLS RIBS C WHICH BY THE RIVERS WASHING AWAY THE BANK ARE NOW DISCOVERD AND BROUGHT TO LIGHT AND IF I MIGHT BE ALLOWD TO GUESS A LITTLE FARTHER I MIGHT THINK IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT AS ERKE LENS IN GELDERLAND IS HERCULIS CASTRA AND  IN CORNWALL WAS HERCULIS PROMONTORIUM SO UPON THE RE CESS OF THE ROMANS THE  WHO SUCCEEDED THEM MIGHT CALL THIS NOTED STATION HERCULCEASTER AND BY COR RUPTION COLCEASTER OR COLCHESTER IS MODERN NAME AND WHAT MAY SOMEWHAT CONFIRM THE CONJECTURE THE ADJA CENT TOWN OF CORBRIDGE WHICH AS I SAID HAS RISEN OUT OF ITS RUINS IS CALLED IN THE CHARTER OF H I WHEREBY THAT KING GAVE IT TO THE SECULAR CANONS OF CARLISLE BE FORE THE ERECTION EITHER OF THE PRIORY OR BISHOPRICK COLBRUGE AND COLBURGH THE SAME AS COLCEASTER THE BRIDGE FROM WHENCE IT MAY SEEM TO TAKE ITS DENOMI NATION BEING OF A MUCH LATER ERECTION THAT OXEN USED295 USED TO BE SACRIFICED TO HERCULES THERE NEEDS NO OTHER EVIDENCE THAN THE ALTAR ITSELF WHEREON AN OXS HEAD WITH SACRIFICING INSTRUMENTS ARE DELINEATED YOU WILL RECEIVE BY THE OXFORD CARRIER A GREAT MANY TEETH AND BONES WHEREBY YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE A MUCH BET TER JUDGMENT WHETHER THEY ARE HUMANE OR NO THAN I CAN ONLY I WOULD OBSERVE THIS THAT IF IT DO NOT APPEAR THAT THEY AGREE PERFECTLY WITH THE TEETH AND BONES OF OXEN IT WILL NOT FOLLOW THAT THEREFORE THEY MUST BE HUMANE AND THAT THERE WERE MEN OF  OUS STATURE WHO MADE USE OF THEM SEEING AS I SAID THERE WERE IN THESE PARTS OTHER CREATURES OF VERY GREAT SIZE TO WHOM THEY MIGHT BELONG AND OF WHOSE TEETH AND BONES WE HAVE NOW VERY FEW SPECIMENS TO COM PARE THEM WITH THUS WITH SOME TROUBLE BOTH TO YOU AND MY SELF I HAVE PERFORMD MY PROMISE AND SHEWN WHAT I SHALL BE READY TO DO UPON ALL OCCASIONS THAT I AM WITH GREAT ESTEEM YOUR VERY AFFECTIONATE FRIEND CARLISLE FEBR 17 171011 AND HUMBLE SERVANT H U G H T O D D X X 2 IV AN

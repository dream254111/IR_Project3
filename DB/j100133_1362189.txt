collecting in the little republic of Salvador on the west coast of Central America it was my fortune to make a more than casual acquaintance with the Derby Flycatcher Pitangus sulphuratus derbianus Though extensive notes were taken on the birds themselves there are many points in regard to incuba tion care of the young etc which in the pursuit of other equally interesting species and frequent change of collecting ground were passed over Aside from the superabundant and everpresent Black Vulture Catharista atrata or Sope which name by the way is occasionally given to the priests because of the merely external resemblance no bird is better known by the na tive population or more quickly noticed by even the most disinterested visitor than the strikingly colored and noisy Chio not so much because of the abun dance of the latter birds but because with the exception of a few Nicaraguan Boattailed Grackles Megaquiscalus nicaraguensis subsp or stray Giraud Flycatchers Myiozetetes texensis texensis they are practically the only small bird to be found inside the larger towns Though noted in greater or lesser num bers in every locality visited from the top of Volcan de San Salvador to the man grove swamps along the coast the center of their abundance is the highly culti vated district surrounding the two largest cities San Salvador and Santa Ana which are situated at about two thousand feet above sea level Toward the two extremes of altitude sea level and 7000 feet the birds become scarcer decidedly so in the mountains and to a much less degree at the coast At Acajutla the port of entry they were quite common The intermediate zone is as has been men tioned above under intense cultivation but at the same time is crisscrossed and cut by innumerable steepbanked gullies varying in depth from a few feet to over a hundred most of the larger ones containing water and all of course hung with a tangle of tropical growth Some of the narrower of these gullies are complete ly arched by trees growing on the rims These ravines together with the tiny fincas or farms placed on the ridges sometimes half a mile wide between make from a Derby standpoint an ideal breeding locality as proven by the pres ence of numerous nesting pairs At a lower elevation where the more open coun try is given over to cattle pastures they are also very common but d not seem to nest as a general thing so close to the ranch houses as in densely populated sec tions These birds were found in considerable numbers too around Lakes Ilo pango and Chanmico At the time of my arrival Derby Flycatchers were already paired off but it was not until the first week in March that nestbuilding in the vicinity of San Salvador at least had commenced The first nest which came under observation was about half completed on the 15th and was collected with four fresh eggs on the 28th In this instance then nearly a month must have been required to build the nest and lay the full complement of eggs Perhaps this time is unusually long but as all that were subsequently found were already occupied at the time of discovery there was no means of determining this point A wide variety of nesting sites is chosen Near San Salvador where cocoanut palms are abundant these are generally selected the nest resting on one or two of the lower fronds at their juncture with the main stem Ordinarily a rather short palm is used an average height being say twenty feet The lowest was a scant six the highest a good fifty In the lower country a small mesquite12 THE CONDOR Vol XVI like tree grows commonly close to water and is used by several other birds in common with the Derbys among them the Hooded Cactus Wren Heleodytes capistratus capistrattus the Sclater and Lichtenstein Orioles Icterus sclateri and Icterus gularis gularis Giraud Flycatcher and Gray Becard Platypsarts aglaiae latirostris These trees almost without exception were swarming with fire ants which lived in the greatly enlarged and swollen thorns and whose sting is very sharp and irritating They seemed to cause the birds no inconvenience even though the tearing apart of a nest would sometimes show the insects present in considerable numbers Wasps nests were encountered all too frequently for comfort and the above mentioned species sometimes built near them un doubtedly for the added protection One Derbys nest was built over and par tially supported by a wasps nest as big as a football That of a Hooded Cactus Wren was also observed in a like situation It may be noted here that the country Derbys seem to be much more peaceably inclined than are their city kin often nesting in close association with one or more pairs of other species In one case four nests were found in one small tree a Derbys a Giraud Flycatchers a Les sons and a Lichtensteins Oriole Three other nests may be recorded as being in rather unusual locations one in a dead tree sticking out of a mud flat about two hundred yards from shore at Lake Ilopango another in a tangle of vines hanging over a bank and the third thirty feet up in a great creeperhung tree and almost hidden in a cluster of purple orchids Remarkable similarity in construction material and shape of nests was noticeable The body including the roof made up of fine dead grass stems with the addition of much soft stuff such as feathers plant down and small rags when available was rather loosely put together The cup or more properly saucer in this case consisted of slightly coarser grass stems well packed and smoothed down and placed well toward the back of the nest entrance on the side and pointing slightly downward thus making a more effective watershed Measurements outside eighteen inches long by ten wide by eight high inside nest cavity seven inches long by five wide by five high the saucer taking up the whole floor These measurements were taken from the first nest collected and may be a little larger than the average By the time the young are ready to leave the formerly purseshaped nest has been flattened out and blackened by the tropical rains and sun and the young birds have so enlarged the entrance that the entire cavity can be plainly seen Fresh eggs were found from March 28 to the first of June so two broods at least are raised each year In every instance a new nest was built for the reception of the second set whether the birds succeeded in raising a first brood or not but in neither case was material ever taken from the first nest to be used in the second Number of eggs ran from four usually three occasionally to two once In the city of San Salvador are a great many birds which are without doubt nonbreeders as only two nests were found in the city proper even though they are mostly in pairs These individuals having nothing better to do contrive to keep things lively by scrapping not only with each other but with anything that happens to attract their attention such as a stray housecat or a wandering hawk A favorite lookout is a tall flag pole or similar point of vantage and this is taken possession of to the exclusion of all other birds most especially of their own kind in fact the advent of another pair onto their preserve is the signal for a battle royal which generally ends as it shouldin favor of the home team From dawn till an hour or so after sunrise and in the cool of the late afternoonJan 1914 NOTES ON THE DERBY FLYCATCHER 13 and early evening they are most active and noisy Their call notes can then be heard in every quarter of the city and the birds themselves are most in evidence snatching flies over heaps of refuse in the gutters hawking about the plazas or kingbirding an unlucky Black Vulture Activity though is by no means con fined to these periods Birds may be found at almost any hour of the day On two occasions one probably the same individual was seen about an arclight long after dark It may have been attracted by the light but in my own mind there is no doubt that the insects which buzzed around the globe in swarms were the real reason for the birds presence as it appeared in no way confused and kept well outside the most brilliant circle of illumination Owing to this fact and also because the light was quite high up I could not actually see the bird catch anything though its frequent short and erratic flights would indicate that this was the object Its perch seemed to be directly above the shade The first time was on March 29 and the second April I When I returned from the coast the last of July the bird was nowhere to be seen though I went twice to look for it W B Judson has noticed the Black Phoebe doing the same thing see CONDOR III 1901 page 186 and it would not be surprising to find with a little more observation that this trait has become common among others of the larger Tyrannidxe More than once too the evening concierto was broken into by an outburst of Chio yells provoked probably by some hunting Barn Owl Aluco sp  several of which used the nearby cathedral tower as a day light retreat As is the case with many other common and wellknown varieties the native name of Chio is derived from the Derbys call note which may best be written cheoh or cheeo generally given rather slowly but under stress of excitement or anger losing entirely its deliberate quality and becoming shrill and hurried At such times too and particularly at the nest where the parents become almost frantic these notes are interspersed and plentifully larded with extremely Kingbirdlike expletives One other species may at first sight be mistaken for derbianus namely the Mexican Boatbilled Flycatcher Megarynchus pitangua mexicanus being almost identical in size and markings and with a very similar call note How ever the absence of the light rufous wing and tail markings so conspicuous in the Derby with shorter tail and heavier bill which last is distinguishable at quite a distance serve to differentiate the two This resemblance is of course merely superficial and except for the points mentioned and a Tyrannine dis position they have nothing in common As would be expected no local distinc tion is made between them both being known as Chio and even the Giraud Flycatcher is universally referred to as Chia or the female Too few specimens were prepared to allow of any definite conclusions regarding food habits except that insects form the entire bill of fare Stomachs examined contained small beetles wasps and small grasshoppers of relative abundance in the order named as well as a great assortment of flying insects which I was not expert enough to identify However the diet must vary a good deal with the locality as well as with the season

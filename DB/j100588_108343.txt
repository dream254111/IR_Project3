Automatic Registration of Magnetometers and other Meteorological Instruments by Photography By CHARLES BROOKE MB FRCSE Sup plement Communicated by G B AIRY Esq FRS Astronomer Royal Received November 23Read November 26 1846 DURING the period of the sunmmer recess the system of automatic meteorological registration by photography has been rendered complete by the adaptation of the barometer and thermometer to the apparatus previously described It having been found a matter of much difficulty to obtain a photographic baseline from the lamp already described as being placed near the magnet the idea naturally arose that the baseline might be simultaneously described by a second lamp placed on the opposite side of the cylinder as represented in fig 1 Plate V A pencil of light proceeding firom this lamp through a horizontal slit in the chimnney is received by a cylindrical lens placed as before horizontally and the focal line of light thus formed is allowed to pass through a corresponding slit in the covering of the cylinder A small section only of this focal line is transmitted through a vertical slit in a piece of thin sheet brass attached to the stand on which the cylinders rest and placed very near the surface of the outer cylinder A line thus described may be seen in Plate VIII fig 4 and Plate IX figs 6 7 8 and the same light has been by the following means rendered available for the registration of the barometer A siphon barometer has been con structed with a column of mercury a little more than one inch in diameter Plate VI figs 1 and 2 As the weight of an entire column of this size would be inconvenient and as it would be difficult to obtain a tube more than three feet long of so large a bore both ends of which were of the same internal area two adjacent short pieces of a very nearly cylindrical tube have been united to the extremities of a tube of small bore and form the ends of the instrument which contain the surfaces of the mercury A wooden cap about two inches high is fitted to the open end of the tube at each end of which are fixed three small friction rollers placed radially vertical and equidistant from each other IThe stem of a glass float having a bulb about half an inch in dianleter lresting on the surface of the mercury passes up vertically between these fric tion rollers by which the free vertical movement of the float is much facilitated At the upper end of the stem is a cap containing a small grooved roller The barometer tube is attached to a board by two clamps so as to be capable of being raised or lowered at pleasure and the bend at the lowest part rests on a piece of wood which is likewise capable of a vertical adjustment Another piece of wood about half an inch thick two inches wide and five or six long is made to slide horizontally between70 MR BROOKE ON THE AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION OF MAGNETOMETERS two slips fixed to the surface of the board at such a height that the top of the float may be opposite the middle point between them To this sliding piece a pulley about three inches in diameter laving a fixed axis about 3 inches long is attached by a suitable support to this pulley two slender wooden arms are attached one thirty inches the other five inches long and fixed at right angles to each other A piece of wire with an adjustible balancing weight is fixed in the pulley in such a position that the axis of the pulley may be the centre of gravity of its appendages The long arm passes through a slit in the stand of the apparatus and catrries a black paper screen with a vertical slit in front of the horizontal aperture in the cover above described see Plate V fig 2 and is so placed that the point at which the slits cross each other is exactly thirty inches from the axis of the pulley The short arm rests on the roller at the end of the float and is marked at the distances of 3 375 and 5 inches from the axis of the pulley The mark which rests on the float may be changed at pleasure by sliding horizontally the piece to which the pulley is attached and accordingly as the marks are respectively placed in the above position it is evi dent that the movement of the point of light transmitted through the slit in the move able screen will be five four or three times the variation in the height of the columnn of mercury and thus by the same lamp the baseline and the barometric curve are traced out Of this fig 4 Plate VIII and fig 7 Plate IX are given as examples In these it may be remarked that both the lines are so sharply iefined that by ap plying a scale divided into 1foths of an inch the position of both may be read to half a division which is equivalent to 0 001 inch of mercury if the first scale be adopted which has been the case in these instances A small weight suspended by a string passing round a groove in thle pulley keeps the short arm in contact with the float by a constant pressure There being an annulus of mercury rather more than onefourth of an inch wide between the tube and the float the effect of capillarity is so mnuch reduced as to exert scarcely any influence on the variations of the column the weight of which is sufficient to over come the small amount of friction that exists in the various parts without sensibly influencing its variation and consequently the barometric curve is frequently con tinuous and not interrupted by jerks In one of the registers not introduced for want of space the passage of an aerial wave is recorded equivalent to less than o oth of an inch of mlercury the duration of which was about 41 minutes The lamp being placed at a distance of about nine inches from the paper the direction of the small pencil by which the curve is traced varies considerably hence an error is introduced in the register equal to the distance of the slit from the paper multiplied by the cotangent of the angle at which the ray is inclined to it this how ever may be either allowed for or obviated by rendering all the rays of the pencil parallel to the same vertical plane by means of a cylindrical lens placed at its focal distance from the lamp  The pulley and slide have since been made of brassMay 1847AND OTHER METEOROILOGICAL INSTRUMENTS BY PHOTOGRAPHY A continuous registration of the variations of the thermometer has been obtained by intercepting the focal line of light formed on the paper as above described by the stem of a thermometer having a wide flat bore A sufficient quantity of light passes through the empty portion of the bore to darken the paper but is entirely excluded from the portion occupied by the mercury The register therefore consists of a light and a dark space separated by a welldefined boundary line the distance of which from the baseline will furnish the required indication This particular application of the apparatus prefers no claim to novelty as a very similar means of registering the variations of the thermometer has already been published and is here introduced merlely as forming a necessary part of a complete system of automatic meteorological registration As a thermometer with a large bore and a scale sufficiently open to give the indi cations of change with the requisite degree of minuteness must of necessity contain a large quantity of mercury which if contained in a globular bulb would not be sufficiently sensitive the instrument which has been used has a long narrow tubular bulb see Plahte VI fig 11 by lengthening which any required amplitude of scale may be obtained without any diminution of sensibility As small differences of temperature have a much greater influence at low tempera tures in determining the hygrometric conditions of the atmosphere from a compa lrison of the therimomneter and psychrometer than they have at higher temperatures and as the range of variation is so much less during winter than in summer it is proposed that a thermorneter and psychrometer having scales of about five degrees to one inch should be used in winter while those for summer use should have a scale of about ten degrees to one inch It having been found practically impossible to depend on the uniformity of a wide flat bore in a glass tube a more than usually correct method of graduating these instruments would be desirable This object would be attained by fixing to the stem a scale of 1ths of an inch which by a suitable vernier might be read with any re quired degree of minuteness A separate comparison of the readings of this scale with two or more good standard thermometers should now be made each being irn mersed with the instrument to be graduated in a vessel of warm water which is allowed to cool very slowly A mean of the results thus obtained would probably afford a very nearly correct graduation which would for the reasons above stated be of most importance at low temperatures If the riegister is required to furnish only differtential results a great length of stemn may be obviated and the safety of the instrument secured if casually exposed to a temperature above its range by a safety bulb at the upper end of the stem as repre sented in the diagram By retaining a certain quantity of mercury in this bulb the mean temperature corresponding to the time of year may be always made to occupy nearly the same place anda change of thermometers thus rendered unnecessary  See Engineers Magazine Nov 1845 7172 MR BROOKE ON THE AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION OF MAGNETOMETERS The six meteorological instruments of which a continuous registration is proposed to be obtained by the means above described are the declination magnet the hori zontal and vertical force magnetometers the barometer the thermometer and the psychrometer and by the arrangements above described two of these may be regis tered on the opposite sides of each of three cylinders the declination and horizontal force magnetometers on a cylinder placed horizontally as represented in the Plate In this case the describing a baseline would be most readily effected by a third lamp The hoirizontal force magnetometer and the barometer on a vertical cylinder the long arm of the barometer index being placed horizontally and the thermometer and psychrometer on a second vertical cylinder which mnust necessarily be placed in the open air This arrangement will not however be attended with any difficulty if the lamps are inclosed in a case similar to a magic lanthorn the chimney of which is protected from the influence of descending currents either by a revolving cap with a spiral lamina attached to it or by FARADAYS ingenious expedient of interrupting the continuity of the chimney at two or more points by parallel conical surfaces The apparatus for carrying the vertical cylinders is represented in Plate VI figs 4 to 8 Figs 9 and 10 Plate VI are views of a carrier for the bifilar nmagnetometer The stem to which the mirror is attached has a stirrup to hold the bar at the lower and a torsion circle at the upper end To the indexplate which moves with stiff friction on the torsion circle is attached a right and lefthanded screw carlrying two pulleys under which the suspension skein passes These may be adjusted by the screw to give the requisite degree of sensibility to the magnet A more accurate adjustment of the angle of torsion may if requisite be obtained by a tangent screw attached to the index and gearing with the circumference of the torsion circle Keppel Street November 23rd 1846 PostscriptIn the endeavour to avoid prolixity the author may perhaps have omitted some details which would have facilitated the construction of the apparatus On some few points on which circumstances have appeared to render further infor mation necessary that has been embodied in the description of the Plates he will however be at all times ready to further the objects of science by communicating any required details to those who may be disposed to make a practical application of them The author takes this

combination of two planocylindrical glass lenses as used in obtaining the register fig 8 Plate IX is here re presented Fig 2 A sketch of the barometer side of the apparatus with lamp c The cylin drical water lens as originally used is represented in this figure Fig 3 A sketch of the lamp in its stand to which the fine slit is attached Fig 4 A section of the burner the wooden socket through which it passes the chimney and the diaphragm onehalf the real size The top of the burner should stand from 022 to 025 inch below the aperture in the diaphragm and the wick should rise from 004 to 005 inch above the top of the burner The illuminating power and steady burning of the lamp without smoking entirely depend on the correct adjustment of these distances if the cam phine is not oxidized by too long keeping Fig 5 A sketch of the diaphragm full size showing a notch or depression of a portion of the edge intervening between the flame and the slit for the pur pose of allowing the passage of rays from all the most luminous portion of the flame some part of which is below the level of the edge of the diaphragm Fig 6 A plan and elevation of the diaphragm full size to show the size and posi tion of the aperture Fig 7 An elevation of the adjustible slit As this is in contact with the chimney its support necessarily becomes very hot and in order to diminish the transmission of heat to the lamp a space of about 01 inch is left between the support and the ring of metal described as surrounding the burner the wings represented in this figure intercept the light that passes through the space here mentioned Fig 8 The friction wheels which support the axis of the horizontal cylinders PLATE VI Fig 1 A side view of the cylinders and timepiece showing their connexion and an elevation of the barometer showing the several parts described If the registers of the balanced magnetometer and barometer are combined as pro posed the relative positions of the index its slit and the cylinders

MAGNETOMETERS extremity of the hourhand that engages with the carrier on the axis of the cylinder Fig 4 A sketch of the apparatus for carrying a vertical cylinder with the requisite arrangement of lenses for combining the registers of the balanced mag netometer and barometer or of the thermometer and psychrometer Fig 5 A vertical cylinder with its outer cylinder A hole in the centre of the cap fits over a pin in the centre of the plate on which it rests and is carried round Fig 6 The horizontal plate on which the cylinder rests The under surface of this plate rests on the edges of three equidistant vertical friction wheels or rollers attached to the frame beneath it A vertical pin fixed to the centre of the under surface of the plate passes down between the edges of three equi distant horizontal rollers which are attached to the under surface of the frame and on this pin the carrier is fixed Fig 7 A frame supported on three legs to which the friction rollers above described are attached By this arrangement the motion is so easy that the effect of the drag on the rate of the timepiece is scarcely sensible Fig 8 The timepiece the rim of which is let into the surface of the stand In doing this great care should be taken that the axis of motion of the hourhand is continuous with the axis of the cylinders and of the plate on which they rest In registering the balanced magnetometer as in the declinometer the cylinder makes two revolutions in 24h and two 12h lines are traced on the paper but for the thermometers the cylinder and consequently the hourhand makes only half a revolution in 24h and each of the two ther mometers is registered on onehalf the paper during that time The cylin der is about 19 inches in circumference which suits the length of a sheet of folio post writingpaper Fig 9 An elevation of the bifilar carrier Fig 10 A side view of the same The centres of gravity of the carrier the mirror and the magnet are very nearly in the same vertical line Fig 11 An elevation of the thermometer tube PLATE VII Figs 1 2 Show the increased sensibility of the paper by the addition of a very small quantity of the iodide of potassium to the first solution Fig 3 Shows the effect produced upon the line by the want of horizontal adjust ment of the plane of incidence and reflexion compared with Fig 4 in which this adjustment has been carefully

magnet when the registration is most important Fig 10 The greatest magnetic shock that has been observed during the year It occurred on April Id 5h 201 Figs 11 12 14 Examples of shocks of these No 12 is the least impulsive It may be remarked that in these and in all other recorded shocks the first im pulse has been to the west and has been followed shortly after by a second to the east Fig 13 Tremor continuing for more than an hour This occurred on April 25d between 20h and 22h and from the habitual quietude of the streets at such a time cannot probably be attributed to local causes Fig 15 A register of July 12d 3h to 8h showing an unusually frequent repetition of small oscillations These oscillations which have been frequently noticed differ considerably from the shocks the magnet appears to be disturbed from a state of rest by gradually increasing oscillations which after having attained a maximum subside in nearly an equal time the period of these disturbances is from two or three to ten or fifteen minutes Fig 16 The effect of a maximum local disturbancea quadrille party in the adjoin ing house The unsteady movement of the magnet is wellcontrasted with the preceding disturbances Fig 17 A disturbance which occurred on April 15d 8h to 9h This differs more essentially from the Greenwich observations than any that has been com pared in the curve laid down by points from the observations made at the Royal Observatory two sharp cusps correspond in time to mere undula tions in the register May it not be inferred that in this instance the disturbing cause was sensibly nearer to Greenwich than to Keppel Street  Fig 18 The register of August 1d 2h to 11 h during which period the great hailstolrm occurred Fig 19 A register obtained at the Royal Observatory without a damper The oscillations of the magnet gradually diminished and after 6 401m it returned to a state of rest Fig 20 The register of April 6d I1 to 13h one of the great disturbances of the year 1846 A very close agreement may be observed between the register and the Greenwich extraordinary observations made between 81 and 1 0o In all the figures of this Plate except fig 5 the scale is that of 20 to 1 inch  All the dates except that of fig 8 Plate IX refer to the year 1846 L2 7576 MR BROOKE ON THE AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION OF MAGNETOMETERS PLATE VIII Fig 1 Register of April 15d 4h to 12h

28d 10h to 29d 10h on the scale of 10 to 1 inch These registers show a general agreement with the Greenwich observations but it appears that the excursions of the regis tered magnet have been generally less than those of the Greenwich magnet No 3 shows a constant succession of small disturbances Fig 4 A register of the thermometer and barometer combined the two instruments being placed on opposite sides of the cylinder The baseline drawn by the barometer lamp may be distinguished through the paler tint produced by the light passing through the empty portion of the thermometer tube PLATE IX Fig 1 Register of August 20d showing an unusual absence of disturbance this is not however a solitary instance Fig 2 Register of September 5d Oh to 11h 30m the greatest magnetic storm of the year 1846 It may be remarked that the excursions of the registered magnet though agreeing in direction were considerably greater in extent than those of the Greenwich magnet The contrary took place in figs 2 3 Plate III This and the preceding are on the scale of 20 to 1 inch Fig 3 Portion of a register on another piece of the same sheet of paper as the pre ceding but on the scale of 10 to 1 inch to

succeeding register of September 6d Oh to I1h on part of the same sheet as 4 Scale 10 to 1 inch The line is equally welldefined but fainter Fig 6 Register of a termday September 23d 10h to 22 with a photographic base line on which the Greenwich observations were laid down at the Royal Observatory This register well illustrates a fact that has been frequently noticed namely the gradual subsidence of slow excursions into small and brief disturbances The scale is 15 to 1 inch Fig 7 Another of the great disturbances of 1846 November 17d Oh to 121h with baseline and register of barometric variations magnified five times The nearly horizontal portion of the line between 6h 20 and 301 indicates the most rapid movement of the magnet that has been recorded by photo graphy No point of it could have been illuminated more than 16s TheAND OTHER METEOROLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS BY PHOTOGRAPHY 77 scale is 15 to 1 inch This register exhibits a very remarkable accordance with the extraordinary observations made at the Royal Observatory during the latter part of the disturbance Two sharp cusps at 8h 2m 30s and at 811 25m may be specially noticed The advantage of automatic registration is here manifest the magnet having been during several previous bihoral observations very steady as may be seen from the first part of the line there was no previous indication of the disturbance which commenced shortly after 6h and the attention of the assistant on duty was directed to the magnets only by his casually observing that the balanced magnetometer had undergone a very remarkable deflection The sudden breaks in the barometer line are due to a small amount of friction that has since been obviated Pig 8 A register of the declinometer from May 1847 Id 231 34m to 3d Oh 4m made in Keppel Street by the apparatus constructed for the Royal Observatory There is no perceptible difference in intensity between the commencement and termination of the line Several shocks may be remarked the W de clination having been as usual increased by the disturbing cause which appears to have commenced and terminated abruptly In some instances the duration of very transient disturbances may be reasonably conjectured fromn the tint of the marks on the paper those for instance at a b have not probably exceeded 20s The absence of vibrations as in the shocks repre sented in Plate VII is probably owing to the inertia of the mercury damper and offers an additional argument in favour of its use The baseline is drawn by a lamp on the opposite side of the cylinder and shows two of the 10s marks previously described The narrowness and sharpness of the base line will materially assist in diminishing the probable error of reading the position of the register by a scale

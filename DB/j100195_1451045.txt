this field of Hebrew studies but very much remains yet to be accomplished The edition of the Yemenite Service Book Jerusalem I89481 a masterly description of which by Prof Bacher appeared in the JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW for April go90 may at first sight seem to make further work unnecessary but the problem is in reality far removed as yet from its ultimate solution The printed text gives us only a redaction of the Yemenite Liturgy made by Yahya b Joseph ibn Salih in the latter half of the eighteenth century together with the same authors Commentary on it In order therefore to obtain informa tion on the earlier and more original form of these Services we must turn our attention to the MS sources at our disposal Another shortcoming of the printed text consists in the fact of its representing only one definite form of the Yemenite Liturgy namely that of Sana and its neighbour hood but the MSS show that there existedand probably still existsa considerable diversity of liturgical use in different Yemenite localities Sana2 it is true must be regarded as the most important centre of Jewish life in Yemen but a thoroughgoing study of the Services now under consideration ought to include some notices of liturgical forms different from those of Sana 1 It should be noted however that a new edition partly based on fresh materials is now in the press at Jerusalem The first part appeared in 1903 2 On Sana as a city and centre of South Arabian life in general see Yacuts Geographisches Worterbuch ed Wiistenfeld III pp 4206GLEANINGS FROM THE YEMENITE LITURGY 69I The most important contributions to the study of the Yemenite ritual in its MS forms are of course those of Dr Neubauer Bodl Catalogue nos 1145 and 2498 and Monatsschrift for I87I pp 3206 and Prof Stein schneider Berlin Catalogue I nos 89 9I 103 and Anhang pp 11730 II end of Vorwort In addition to the other literature on the subject given by Prof Bacher at the beginning of his article in the JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW already referred to must now be mentioned Dr Pinkas Heinrichs Fragment eines Gebetbuches aus Yemen Wien 19021 The largest collection 2 so far known of Yemenite liturgical MSS is however found at the British Museum and after havingso far as my ability goesmade a complete study of the materials there pre served I may be allowed to place before the readers of this REVIEW a series of notes short texts and alphabetical lists 3 of Piyyfitim calculated to amplify our knowledge of the subject and to throw light on various matters connected with the theme Descriptions of the MSS have just appeared in the second volume of the Museum Catalogue of the Hebrew and Samaritan MSS and I should wish the materials now offered to be regarded as supplementary to the information necessarily limited given in that work A It will be useful first of all to classify the Museum MSS belonging to this section the more so as such a classifica tion may at the same time serve as an opportunity for noting down some special features of the Services under consideration 1 See also Dr S Poznanskis description of the Vienna edition of the Yemenite Liturgy in J Q R XVII I8992 2 Mr E N Adlers considerable collection of the same services no doubt also deserves careful study 3 It almost goes without saying that no liturgical studies can be systematically carried out before an alphabetical arrangement has been effected of all the Piyyiutim which are in the Catalogues necessarily given in the order in which they occur in the MSS Z Z692 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW I Of the fourteen MSS1 belonging to the Yemenite rite Or 2227 must be regarded as forming a class by itself In substance it indeed belongs to the same category as the MSS to be noted under II but it shows a systematic arrangement of its own After the portions for week days and rnta nwI ninwn nran c it has a long section extending from fol 33 b to fol 96 a which in this complete form is peculiar to itself It may be described as a general guide to the Services of the Yemenite Synagogues It begins with a chapter relating to the times of prayer fi5K nwpiK SDE   This is followed by a i on certain conditions which render a person unfit for prayer hilymK wytlD l it Then follows a long chapter dealing with the entire order of prayers rinlm nqtK inwt  X including prayers for weekdays both public and private prayers for the Sabbathday wmn wsl nzn fastdays Wn t1 KN c Next comes a L on persons who say their prayers without proper preparation l In In n41 t4 I and after chapters on Biblical lections throughout the year and benedictions and minor offices including nqan Marriage Service c the section concludes with the Passovernight Service noin 45 nvwn nID followed by inyn nvD 5r4n Nryv  nrim nn4y and Ihtnnn Nnly This MS is the finest in the Museum collection and as it is apart from Or 1470 which contains the Haftar6th only also the oldest having been written in Sana in 1540 AD it will be granted that it for more reasons than one deserves the place of honour in this interesting section of liturgical MSS It will be seen later on that the two short texts on the Calendar and on Repentance included in this paper have been taken from this MS II To the next and longest group belong Or 2418 2389 2390 2417 2673 1480 I479 All these contain like Or 2227 the order of Services for the whole year although several of them have their own special characteristics 1 An account of Or 4113 included in the number of MSS here given will be found in the Catalogue II p 395GLEANINGS FROM

Not less remarkable is the fact that instead of the rnmy appearing in the MSS in its proper place in the Services for IIm nW it is given separately in quite a different part of each respective MS This circumstance might be taken to justify the opinion that the Yemenites originally used no nmrny at all for 13 D1 but that this portion of the Service was introduced at some later period through outside influence from one direction or another As the Yemenite Services are commonly grouped with the Spanish branch one would have expected nl nnr to have been adopted in preference to any other nflmi A composition of Ibn Ezras was however as the work of a Spanish poet found suitable enough to compete with n ins and in earlier timesas it seemsto retain its position sole and un disputed Among the invariable features belonging to this group of MSS including Or 2227 are I a section on the Calen dar entitled nwan D ni InUN nDnr or nis n2Dn mW  2 a series of formulae entitled nnDwni Iounm nnznn nmri Instead however of enumerating the other common features of this group the readers attention may now be drawn to some special characteristics of one or other of the MSS belonging to the same class a Or 2389 is distinguished by a very long series of ninwnm nl vw containing no fewer than 186 numbers This list accordingly shows more effectively than any of694 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the other lists of Hymns and Praises  in the group the very considerable extent to which Spanish Piyyutim of the best period have been utilized by the Yemenites although native compositions with Hebrew and Arabic used alter nately are also well represented b The chief peculiarity of Or 2390 consists in an entirely new form of the sixth pia viz rnnn pip of rn3 As the text of this pa is given in full

Yemenite Liturgy This influence shows itself more especially in the form of nmW nSIp TD several hymns of the Kabbalistic school just named being embodied in the Service These are also the only two MSS of the group which have the 41r nr5 also embodied in the printed edition III Or 6354 and 6355 must mainly on account of their contents not covering the Services for the whole year be classed by

Massorah Magna and Parva and the Targum provided with the superlinear punctuation in alternate verses It should be noted that the Haftarth here given differ in a good many points from both the Sephardi and the Ashkenazi use VI Or 4I 12 is a roll of the sixteenth century containing the wellknown texts of tr n3 w I NrY ni a nnmon II nfn npP VII Entirely different from all the MSS already named is Or 4114 containing the Diwan known as that of Joseph Shabbezi stw Similar MSS have been described by David v Giinzburg in Steinschneiders Festschrift and Prof Bacher in Berliners Festschrift Or 4I 14 is however more extensive than these and with the permission of the editors I may perhaps be able to give in a future number of this REVIEW alphabetical lists of the pieces contained in the MS together with the acrostics or any other evidence of authorship B AN INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER ON THE CALENDAR This short text taken from Or 2227 but embodied in a more or less modified form in MSS of group II isas will be seen at a glancesimilar in nature to the earlier portions of such works as 67ry lo the nppn Ito of Abraham b David and similar compositions It might on account of its Arabic form be placed by the side of the earlier portion of the Tnjnis 3 n published by Dr Neubauer in Anecdota Oxoniensia Semitic Series vol I part IV The Yemenites in fact showed much discrimination in beginning their calendar computations with an introductory chapter on chronology The practical value of the Jewish calendar lies of course in the means it provides for finding the dates of fasts and feasts and for determining the cycle of Biblical lections throughout the year and as these696 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW sacred observances hang together with events narrated in Biblical history it is clear that chronology must form an integral part of the system As for the contents of the text here given it will suffice to note down a summary of its chief chronological data The student will of course compare these with the other chronological works at his disposal In the present place only a note or two of comparison will be given at the foot of the page The chief data are as follows I The time that elapsed between the creation of Adam and the exodus was 2448 1 years but Adam was created one year after the creation of the world 2 and it therefore follows that the exodus took place 2449 years after the creation 2 A period of 480 years passed between the exodus and the building of the first Temple 3 The first Temple lasted 4Io years 4 The pln or lying waste of the Temple continued for seventy years 5 The second Temple lasted 420 years 6 Ezra3 died in the fortyfirst year of the second Temple this being at the same time the beginning of the rule of Alexander the Great when the custom of dating documents DTTDS finr ln began among the Jews This text is also valuable from another point of view It begins with the statement that the year in which this part of the calendar was composed or first embodied in the IlMS oDn was A M 5089 A D 1329 This date there fore takes us back into comparative antiquity and it is 1 It may here be noted that the Karaite computation as given in the Brit Mus MS Or 2536 places the exodus at 2446 or 2444 after the creation 2 This difference in date between the creation of the world and that of Adam is a refinement peculiar so far as the Museum MSS go to Or 2227 3 The Yemenite tradition therefore knows nothing of a son of Ezra during whose religious administration the arrival of the Greeks took place see eg mii Dvl no Amsterdam 1711 fol  aGLEANINGS FROM THE YEMENITE LITURGY 697 not impossible that the Yemenite Liturgy in essentially the form in which we have it now was redacted at about that time A Liturgy in a simpler form containing all the essential elements of the o1TD of course existed in Yemen many centuries before but it may well be that early in the fourteenth century a new departure was made in the direction of transforming the irVD into a kind of ltrnn and of combining it with a calendar definite liturgical directions and formulae for marriagecontracts letters of divorcements and various business contracts If this be so this introductory chapter on the calendar will have to be regarded as a document of very great importance for the history of the Yemenite Liturgy But another point is yet to follow At the end of the Arabic text another date is given There a period of 5z68 is stated to have passed from the creation to the time of writing A M 5268 A D I508 It is clear therefore that the introductory chapter prefixed to the calendar computations in Or 2227 passed through a fresh redaction in I508 the MS itself belonging to 1540 that is only thirtytwo years later This circum stance would seem to make it more certain still that AD 1329 was a fresh startingpoint for the Yemenite Liturgy for a redactor of 1508 would hardly have left the earlier date at the beginning of the chapter if that date had not been regarded as an integral part of the document in its original form The text itself may now follow Or 2227 fol T88 b six lines from bottom 1nlyK uDn 1r1nnY ip5l yJKi Nb  nnfc S vy 6nSmyS tfnn t

SELi4OTH This 5a is taken from Or 2227 but is found in several other MSS of group II It will suffice to indicate the main features of the chapter A point is made at the outset of the importance of faith in the efficacy of repentance If so the argument runs the sinner does not believe in the possibility of his restoration to Divine favour he would continue in his bad courses seeing that there is no help for him at all But if he knows that he can by means of repentance return to his former state of moral healthfulness he may make an effort to reform his 1 MS nlDrno704 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW life Touching on the old problem why Providence has ordered things in this way and none other Ni INl D1 the answer to this and similar questions is that so it was willed and that so Divine wisdom decreed it Nizl Nw m3 nnrn nrnpM Mans conduct is declared to be in mans power The justice of God in distributing rewards and punishments is thus vindicated1 Nothing escapes the Divine eye not even the weight of the smallest insect n pipnno2 It was for the purpose of guiding man into ways of repentance that the Day of Atonement as well as the feast of mwn rwi and the intervening days of penitence were instituted The object of blowing the trumpet is to rouse up men from their sluggishness and faulty lives and call them to a new and better life Regarding the collec tions of nlnrso that follow the Im the writer says that the learned poets have composed many pieces bearing on repentance but only some of these have been brought together in this place the entire number of pieces being too great to be included in the collection He then gives some forms of confession suggested by certain Biblical passages At the end the duty of reconciliation to men with whom one may be at variance is insisted on If the person wronged has died pardon should be asked at the grave in the presence of ten other men It would be interesting to ascertain the time when this piece was composed The suggestion is made here that its date is either about 1329 or 1508 see under B but further investigation is necessary Or 2227 fol 103 b p31 X3 NKpK9RI bSKfiKlI wop tr inmS tw bS31 S a ID 15i wpn1mr

of praise ought to be spoken The style is clear concise active enliv ened by apt illustrations  breezy  may perhaps be the word The thought is practical and clearheaded as Professor Hart always is and the essays themselves have been brought down to date It is a promising sign of the times that the college professor is busying himself with education and its problems  not simply propounding theories and giving advice but taking a vigorous hand in the solution of practical ques tions as Professor Hart is doing in Cambridge And this is what gives especial weight to words from Professor Hart even if they show a tendency to spread over a somewhat wide field as beginnings in any field of science or art always do We venture to predict that while one who begins to read to day will scarcely stop until the end these essays will have a deeper interest in future days in view of what Professor Hart will say and do in the cause of education in time to come V B Jacobs fligh School Providenec R I NOTES The appearance of a new literary journal backed by a wellknown firm of publishers is an event We have received the first three numbers of The Book man Dodd Mead  Co N Y I50 and they certainly justify a lively in terest in the future issues The second number contains no less than four contributions from members of the faculty of Columbia College If this in dicates that the magazine is to be in some large degree representative of Columbias literary scholarship no one will think the less of it for that Cer tainly the new venture deserves success A new edition of The Philosophy of leaching by Arnold Tompkins Ginn  Co omits the chapter on school management of the former edition the author expressing the hope of giving that phase of pedagogic work adequate treatment in a separate volume Mr Tompkins takes high ground at once in his introduction I feel moved he says to show how helptul in prac tice daily and hourly are the universal principles which philosophy an nounces The work is richly suggestive but it is by no means milk for pedagogical babes The authors ideas seem to us sound if sometimes a lit tle tinged with transcendentalism As instruments of popular education public libraries certainly rank nex to public schools and both are indispensable More than a techinal in terest for librarians only thus attaches to the attractive little volume on Pub 304Notes 305 lic Libraries in America by the accomplished librarian of Amherst College Mr W I Fletcher in the Columbian Knowledge Series For a very large number of people who have the care of small libraries especially school libraries this work with its simple practical account of the care of books and their proper marshalling on shelves will prove of indispensable utility The larger number who have a private library small or great will also read these pages with lively interest The more one with any love for books and interest in their habits reads Mr Fletchers pages the more reluctant one grows to lay down the book without finishing it Not only does the book describe the library and give ample directions for its management but it also con tains a collection of statistical information that is unique Several good illustrations add to the attractiveness of the volume that of the interior of the library of the University of Leyden in I6o0 being especially good Many teachers who have opportunity to read with their classes a consider able amount of Chaucer will welcome Prof Skeats edition of The House of Fame That it is scholarly and critical a work for the accurate student goes without saying The notes and vocabulary are good though not volu minous he introduction compresses into six pages a large amount of in formation in regard to authorship date foreign influences metre imitations authorities etc The two pages on the defects of the Fairfax manuscript mode of correcting false readings and possible additions to the noteswill be more appreciated by the scholarly teacher than by the ordinary student Ihere is no grammatical introduction but this is not likely to be missed since The House of Fame will seldom or never be the first work of Chaucer taken up for study One is tempted to wish that editions of Chaucer might sometimes give us helps to purely literary study as well as helps linguistic and historical The first meeting of the Academic Principals of New Hampshire will be held at Tilton on May i6th 17th and i8th An admirable programme has been arranged and a notable gathering is certain The permanent organi zation of the secondary teachers of New Hampshire is another step in the right direction Principal Elmer E French of McGraw Institute has taken the initiative in the movement The programme for the General Sessions of the National Educational Association which is to meet at Denver July 9I2 has been made public and leaves no possible doubt that the meeting will be one of great interest and value The programme restricts each of the three morning sessions to the discussion of a single subject and opportunity is to be permitted for gen eral discussion under the five minute rule The three topics that have been selected to be presented and discussed on this occasion are i The Coordination of Studies in Elementary Education 2 The Duty and Opportunity of the Schools in Promoting Patriotism and Good Citizenship 3 The Instruction and Improvement of Teachers now at Work in the SchoolsThe School Revieze These topics are all practical and of interest to teachers of all grades and in all sections of the country The educators who have been secured to discuss these topics will represent the best talent of the country and would indeed be a credit to any country None of the separate department programmes are more interesting perhaps none as interesting as that of the Department of Secondary Education which was published in full in the April number of the SCHOOL REVIEW The programmes contain no sensational features but indicate a convention where much hard work will be done and much good of the most practical character accomplished In order to avoid conflict in dates with the 5oth Meeting of the New York State Teachers Association the Regents have changed the date of the Convocation of 1895 to Thursday Friday and Saturday June 2729 In this connection it is interesting to note that the Regents at their last meeting passed the following resolution That in the opinion of the Regents of the University the best interests of higher education in New York demand that each institution in the University send at least one delegate to the annual Convocation and that the necessary expenses should be paid by the institu tion and not personally by the delegates A First Book in Political Economy for the use of schools and high schools by Robert Ellis Thompson S T D President of the Central High School Philadelphia Will be published in August by Ginn  Co The author is a wellknown economist with a gift for the popular presentation of abstract questions Professor R S Tarr of Cornell University author of Economic Geology of the United States will publish the coming summer through Macmillan  Co a textbook on Physical Geography intended especially for secondary schools The work is planned to meet fully the recommendations in the Report of the Committee of Ten on Physiography The authors experience and skill as a writer lead to the hope that the work will meet exactly the wantsof the many schools that have been anxiously awaiting the appearance of a suitable text book in order to introduce this subject into their curriculums The official report of the recent Classical Conference at Ann Arbor will occupy the greater part of the June issue of the SCHOOL REVIEW Nothing more important or timely could be presented Some of the features of the report are mentioned on the inside front cover of this issue The first instalment of the Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc having shown the environment in which the heroines childish years were passed the second in the May Harpers will carry forward the marvellous story to the beginning of Joans efforts to take to the Dauphin the message she had received from heaven  It is appointed that I shall drive the English out of France and set the crown upon your head The twentyeighth annual meeting of the Massachusetts Association of Classical and High School Teachers was held in Newtonville in the Gymna 306Notes sium of the Newton High School on Friday and Saturday April Igth and 2oth The following interesting programme was presented What is a High School  Frank A Hill Secretary Massachusetts Board of Education Cambridge What is a High School for Edward J Goodwin High School Newton The Essentials of College Preparation

published by Maynard Merrill  Co is admirably adapted to the needs of quite young pupils It is an altogether chaiming story telling how an active little school boy sent into the country to recuperate after an illness won upon the affections of an austere old bachelor until little by little he com pletely transformed the ways of his household The method of publishing the Report of the Committee of Fifteen and especially the copyrighting of the report has been recently made the subject of no little criticism in educational periodicals The animus of many of these criticisms was evident An editorial in the April Educational Review states fully and frankly all there is in the matter and as is usual in such cases telling the truth is all that is necessary The wisdom of the course adopted by the officers of the Association is a matter on which opinions may and will differ but their motives no one can honestly question The adoption of some settled policy in the matter of the publications of the N E A is highly desirable and is soon to be effected will have been effected possibly by the time this reaches our readers The following plans are under consideration i To give the privilege of issuing the report in its final form to that pub lisher or educational journal who makes the highest bid for the privilege 2 To fix a royalty on payment of which to the National Educational Association any publisher or educational journal may issue the report in pamphlet or book form 3 To let anyone who chooses publish the report in pamphlet or book form exacting no royalty whatever The latter plan would we think be most favorably received by the teach ers of the country but it is doubtful whether it would result in as thorough a dissemination of the report as some other Among the many attractive and handsome Easter numbers so popular among readers of magazines and papers The Youths Companion excels in appropriateness to the season and in the exceptional quality of its reading mat ter The Story of a Statue by the Marquis of Lorne prepared for The Com panion in collaboration with the Princess Louise is an article of rare inter 307308 zhe School Review est  Dorothys Easter and A Corner in Eggs are two typical Easter stories well worth twice reading The Romance of a Shoal an adven ture story by W Clark Russell would be hard to duplicate Bartletts Concordance to Shakespeare which has been in preparation over twenty years has been recently published by Messrs Macmillan  Co The work contains some 400000 entries and is far more comprehensive and complete than any other volume of the same nature The subject of  Fear will be taken up by Prof James Sully in the next of his Studies of Childhood to appear in the May Popiular Science Monthly His investigations show that while some children are afraid of heavy rum bling sounds like peals of thunder others are pleased by them but are greatly disturbed by much smaller sharp sounds Opposite effects are pro duced in small children by the first sight of the sea A study of coeducation in America as exemplified in a college of the Middle West by Madame Blanc the wellknown writer for the Revue des Deux Mondes will appear with numerous illustrations in McClures Maga zine for May It is an encouraging sign of the times that an Oxford scholar should write a book about an American university especially a good book and a kindly one Harvat d College by an Oxonian by George Birkbeck Hill Honorary Fellow of Pembroke College Oxford Macmillan  Co 225 is such a book It was written after a reasonably long stay in Cambridge and is full of a just appreciation of the noble institution with which it deals All phases of the college history and life receive full and sympathetic treat ment The illustrations headed by an excellent frontispiece of President Eliot add much to the interest of the pages The April number of Germania completes its sixth volume and is accom panied with a complete index of its contents We cannot too highly com mend this magazine for every student and teacher of the German language The perusal of its index will convince everyone of its high value Brown Universityin connection with the School Committee of Providence has established a system which will be of special value to the students of Brown University who are preparing to teach at the close of their academic course The arrangement proposed is very similar to that which has been successfully tried in the German gymnasiums for several years It gives the student who intends making teaching a profession the opportunity for a thorough practical training under the advice of old and experienced teachers Next year there will probably be four students chosen to fill the positions of student teachers from the members of this years graduating class who shall have taken pedagogy during the coming spring term They will not of course have taken the full years course that will be provided in the future but as all will be required to take a series of postgraduate studies in peda gogy during the yea that they teach the deficiency may be nearly if not wholly made up after graduation By the opening of the second year all will be running smoothlyINotes rhe requirement for teaching and studying at the same time will not be too severe on the candidates for they will be on duty only about three hours instead of the regular five hours per day with a reduction to half pay They will be expected to teach two hours per day to do clerical and disciplinary work one hour per day and to put in one hour a week also in observation in other rooms of the school For these services they will receive 400 per annum in case of men and 300 in case of women The regular salary at which a teacher begins in the High School is 8oo so that the city as well as the college is a gainer by this plan The rules of the High School make it necessary that all teachers appointed shall have college diplomas and no deviation from this rule will be allowed At the close of their year of training they will also receive a second diploma signed by the Superintendent of Schools and Professor of Pedagogy and may receive the degree of A M from the University if the necessary work has been done The student teachers work in the High School will be under the direction of the teacher of that branch of which they maka a specialty At college they will be compelled to take the seminary course in pedagogy and confer ence in pedagogy with any other postgraduate courses desired The sys tem thus becomes practically a fellowship in this branch of learning in which the majority of the colleges of this country are at present deficient and the Providence High School and Brown University will share the honor of first introducing this system into the United States  Topics for the Study of Greek Mythology by Anna Gooding Dodge is a little pamphlet of I9 pages published by Lee and Shepard It is intended as a reference help for the use of teachers and contains tabulated lists of all the principal Greek Myths followed by references to English Literature The latter are very abundant and probably there are few teachers of English literature who would not find them helpful The work is based on Bulfinchs popular Age of Fables To the list of reference books on the general subjects Frazers Golden Bough  might have been added A recent valuable addition to the Atheneum Press Series of Messrs Ginn  Co is a volume of Selections from the Essays of Francis Jeffrey The editor Mr Lewis E Gates of Harvard has prefixed to the selections an introduction of 45 pages in which he has given an appreciative account of Jeffrey and a history of the origin of the English Reviews It is admirably written and will serve well to introduce the students to an important period in the literary history of this country The selections are well chosen not only as illustrations of Jeffreys work but also because they discuss some of the most important literary work of the early part of the century and the notes evince wide reading and add much to the value of a book which is well adapted not only to college students but to the more advanced classes in our secondary schools 309

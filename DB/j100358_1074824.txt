THE ESSAYS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO DATE IT IS A PROMISING SIGN OF THE TIMES THAT THE COLLEGE PROFESSOR IS BUSYING HIMSELF WITH EDUCATION AND ITS PROBLEMS  NOT SIMPLY PROPOUNDING THEORIES AND GIVING ADVICE BUT TAKING A VIGOROUS HAND IN THE SOLUTION OF PRACTICAL QUES TIONS AS PROFESSOR HART IS DOING IN CAMBRIDGE AND THIS IS WHAT GIVES ESPECIAL WEIGHT TO WORDS FROM PROFESSOR HART EVEN IF THEY SHOW A TENDENCY TO SPREAD OVER A SOMEWHAT WIDE FIELD AS BEGINNINGS IN ANY FIELD OF SCIENCE OR ART ALWAYS DO WE VENTURE TO PREDICT THAT WHILE ONE WHO BEGINS TO READ TO DAY WILL SCARCELY STOP UNTIL

INTERESTING PERHAPS NONE AS INTERESTING AS THAT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SECONDARY EDUCATION WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN FULL IN THE APRIL NUMBER OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE PROGRAMMES CONTAIN NO SENSATIONAL FEATURES BUT INDICATE A CONVENTION WHERE MUCH HARD WORK WILL BE DONE AND MUCH GOOD OF THE MOST PRACTICAL CHARACTER ACCOMPLISHED IN ORDER TO AVOID CONFLICT IN DATES WITH THE 5OTH MEETING OF THE NEW YORK STATE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THE REGENTS HAVE CHANGED THE DATE OF THE CONVOCATION OF 1895 TO THURSDAY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY JUNE 2729 IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE REGENTS AT THEIR LAST MEETING PASSED THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION THAT IN THE OPINION OF THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY THE BEST INTERESTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN NEW YORK DEMAND THAT EACH INSTITUTION IN THE

WHATEVER THE LATTER PLAN WOULD WE THINK BE MOST FAVORABLY RECEIVED BY THE TEACH ERS OF THE COUNTRY BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER IT WOULD RESULT IN AS THOROUGH A DISSEMINATION OF THE REPORT AS SOME OTHER

UNIVERSITYIN CONNECTION WITH THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE OF PROVIDENCE HAS ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM WHICH WILL BE OF SPECIAL VALUE TO THE STUDENTS OF BROWN UNIVERSITY WHO ARE PREPARING TO TEACH AT THE CLOSE OF THEIR ACADEMIC COURSE THE ARRANGEMENT PROPOSED IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY TRIED IN THE GERMAN GYMNASIUMS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IT GIVES THE STUDENT WHO INTENDS MAKING TEACHING A PROFESSION THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A THOROUGH PRACTICAL TRAINING UNDER THE ADVICE OF OLD AND EXPERIENCED TEACHERS NEXT YEAR THERE WILL PROBABLY BE FOUR STUDENTS CHOSEN TO FILL THE POSITIONS OF STUDENT TEACHERS FROM THE MEMBERS OF THIS YEARS GRADUATING CLASS WHO SHALL HAVE TAKEN PEDAGOGY DURING THE COMING SPRING TERM THEY WILL NOT OF COURSE HAVE TAKEN THE FULL YEARS COURSE THAT WILL BE PROVIDED IN

OPENING OF THE SECOND YEAR ALL WILL BE RUNNING SMOOTHLYINOTES RHE REQUIREMENT FOR TEACHING AND STUDYING AT THE SAME TIME WILL NOT BE TOO SEVERE ON THE CANDIDATES FOR THEY WILL BE ON DUTY ONLY ABOUT THREE HOURS INSTEAD OF THE REGULAR FIVE HOURS PER DAY WITH A REDUCTION TO HALF PAY THEY WILL BE EXPECTED TO TEACH TWO HOURS PER DAY TO DO CLERICAL AND DISCIPLINARY WORK ONE HOUR PER DAY AND TO PUT IN ONE HOUR A WEEK ALSO IN OBSERVATION IN OTHER ROOMS OF THE SCHOOL FOR THESE SERVICES THEY WILL RECEIVE 400 PER ANNUM IN CASE OF MEN AND 300 IN CASE OF WOMEN THE REGULAR SALARY AT WHICH A TEACHER BEGINS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL IS 8OO SO THAT THE CITY AS WELL AS THE COLLEGE IS A GAINER BY THIS PLAN THE RULES OF THE HIGH SCHOOL MAKE IT NECESSARY THAT ALL TEACHERS APPOINTED SHALL HAVE COLLEGE DIPLOMAS AND NO DEVIATION FROM THIS RULE WILL BE ALLOWED AT THE CLOSE OF THEIR YEAR OF TRAINING THEY WILL ALSO RECEIVE A SECOND DIPLOMA SIGNED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND PROFESSOR OF PEDAGOGY AND MAY

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012450,RELIGIONS REPLY TO ECONOMICS,I242626,NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS RELIGIONS REPLY TO ECONOMICS THE CAPITALISTIC SYSTEM OF INDUSTRY IS UNDER FIRE THE ATTACK IS BEING PRESSED ON MANY SIDES BUT MAINLY FROM TWO CONSPICUOUS POINTS OF VANTAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE CAPITALISM IS BEING ASSAILED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF EFFICIENCY ITS PRODUCTION OF WEALTH IS WASTEFUL BOTH OF NATURAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND ITS DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRODUCT ON THE BASIS OF SERVICE RENDERED FALLS SHORT OF JUSTICE THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPETITION HAS BROKEN DOWN INSTEAD OF A DELICATELY BALANCED SYSTEM WORKING AUTOMATICALLY AND WITHOUT FRICTION AND DISORDER THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD HOLDS TOGETHER ONLY BECAUSE OF THE NECESSARY INTRUSION OF SUCH ARTIFICIAL ELEMENTS AS ORGANIZED CAPITAL ORGANIZED LABOR POLITICAL REGULATION AND SOCIAL OWNERSHIP IN THE SECOND PLACE CAPITALISM IS BEING ATTACKED FROM THE SIDE OF MORALS AND RELIGION THE SYSTEM OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP AND WAGELABOR IS NOT ONLY INEFFICIENT BUT INHUMANE AND MATERIALISTIC ITS CRUELTY IS SEEN IN SUCH COMMONPLACE ACCOM PANIMENTS OF ITS ACTIVITY AS CHILDLABOR SWEATSHOPS TENEMENTS AND SLUMS UN SANITARY FACTORIES UNGUARDED MACHINERY INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND DISEASES TWELVE HOUR DAYS AND SEVENDAY WEEKS OF LABOR CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED OR BETTERED WITHIN RECENT YEARS MAINLY BY THE INTERFERENCE AND COMMAND OF THE PEOPLE ACTING THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITIES OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT NOR NEED I ENLARGE UPON THE MATERIALISM FOSTERED BY OUR MODEM INDUSTRIAL LIFE IF ONE WERE TO TRY TO INVENT A SYSTEM SAYS PROF RAUSCHENBUSCH IN HIS CHRISTIANITY AND THE SOCIAL CRISIS WHICH SHOULD FOSTER COVETOUSNESS TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE ONE COULD NOT IMPROVE UPON OUR PRESENT ORDER OF THINGS CAPITALISM STANDS INDICTED BEFORE THE BAR OF RELIGION BECAUSE IT IS AT BOTTOM SELFISH AND SELFISHNESS IS THE ESSENCE OF SIN AT A TIME WHEN CAPITALISM IS THUS CONDEMNED FROM THE SIDES BOTH OF EFFICIENCY AND OF MORALS IT IS NOT SURPRISING PERHAPS THAT THERE ARE FEW TODAY SO MEAN AS TO DO THE SYSTEM REVERENCE NOW AND THEN HOWEVER A VALIANT VOICE IS LIFTED AND SUCH A VOICE DO WE HAVE IN PROF CARVERS ABLE AND EFFECTIVE LITTLE BOOK ENTITLED THE RELIGION WORTH HAVING ESSAYING TO ANSWER THE SPECIFIC QUESTION IS RELIGION OF ANY USE AND THUS TO ENTER THE RELIGIOUS FIELD FOR THE FIRST TIME THE AUTHOR SOON FINDS HIMSELF BACK UPON HIS OLD FAMILIAR ECONOMIC STAMPING GROUND AND HIS BOOK THEREFORE BECOMES NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN A CHALLENGE TO THE TWOFOLD CRITICISM OF CAPITALISM WHICH I HAVE OUTLINED ABOVE LIFE TO PROF CARVER IS FUNDAMENTALLY A STRUGGLE FIRST A STRUGGLE AMONG SOCIAL GROUPS AND SECONDLY A STRUGGLE AMONG THE INDIVIDUALS IN EACH GROUP MODIFIED CONTROLLED AND DIRECTED SO AS TO PROMOTE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE GROUP IN ITS INTERGROUP STRUG GLE THE OBJECT OF THIS STRUGGLE IS THE CONTROL OVER THE FORCES OF NATURE AND THROUGH THIS CONTROL OF COURSE DOMINION OVER THE REST OF MANKIND AS MANKIND HAS    DOMINION OVER THE REST OF THE ANIMAL CREATION THIS OBJECT WILL BE CARVER T N THE RELIGICN WORTH HAVING PP VII 140 PRICE100 NEW YORK MACMILLAN COMPANY 1911 313THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ATTAINED BY THAT GROUP WHICH SO REGULATES THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ITS INDIVIDUALS AS TO SECURE THE LARGEST MEASURE OF SUCCESS TO THOSE WHO STRENGTHEN THE GROUP MOST AND TO BRING POVERTY FAILURE OR PUNISHMENT TO THOSE WHO STRENGTHEN IT LEAST THOSE STRENGTHEN THE GROUP MOST WHO HAVE THE LARGEST FUND OF PRODUCTIVE ENERGY AND THE LARGEST MEASURE OF PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY THESE MEN CAN BE BEST DISCOVERED BY THE OPEN STRUGGLE WITHIN THE GROUP OF ECONOMIC COMPETITION JUST AS THE BEST RUNNERS CAN BE DISCOVERED BY A RACE CAPITALISM IN OTHER WORDS IS NOT ONLY A NICE TEST OF THE INDIVIDUALS BUT IT IS AT THE SAME TIME A CERTAIN MEANS OF GETTING THE ECONOMIC RESOURCES OF THE NATION INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CAN HANDLE THEM MOST PRODUCTIVELY AND OF BRINGING FAILURE AND POVERTY TO THOSE UNFORTUNATE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT WORTH THEIR KEEP IT IS THE PARABLE OF THE TALENTS ALL OVER AGAIN TO HIM THAT HATH SHALL BE GIVEN AND FROM HIM THAT HATH NOT SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY EVEN THAT WHICH HE HATH HERE IS PROF CARVERS ANSWER TO THE CHARGE THAT CAPITALISM IS INEFFICIENT IT IS OBVIOUSLY A REASSERTION IN THE BALDEST TERMS OF THE OLD ECONOMIC INDIVIDUALISM OF THE MANCHESTER SCHOOL THE GENIUS HAS NEVER ARISEN HE SAYS WHO COULD EVEN SUGGEST A WAY OF DISTRIBUTING THE WEALTH OR THE PLACES OF RESPONSIBILITY IN A NATION WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER AS A TEST IT WOULD BE INTEREST ING TO PAUSE HERE AND QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF SUCH A RESTATEMENT AS THIS OF THE OLD POLITICAL ECONOMY WE SHOULD LIKE TO ASK IF THE EXISTING INEQUALITIES OF WEALTH AND OF THE OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF THE RESOURCES OF NATIONS ARE COMMENSURATE IN ANY SENSE WITH THE PRODUCTIVE ENERGY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE INDIVIDUALS CON CERNED WE SHOULD LIKE TO INQUIRE IF ARTIFICIAL MONOPOLIES SPECIAL PRIVILEGES AND INDUSTRIAL DESPOTISMS ARE NOT THE INEVITABLE ACCOMPANIMENTS OF SUCH A STRUGGLE AND IF THE ATTEMPT TO ELIMINATE THESE EXTRANEOUS FACTORS IN THE SITUATION BY SOCIAL CONTROL IS NOT ITSELF THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE END OF THAT ECONOMIC COMPETITION WHICH THE PROFESSOR LAUDS SO HIGHLY WE SHOULD LIKE TO DEBATE THE PROBLEM OF THAT POVERTY FOR WHICH AS DR DEVINE PUTS IT IN HIS MISERY AND ITS CAUSES THE INDIVIDUAL WHO SUFFERS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE BUT WHICH IS NOT BEYOND THE CONTROL OF SOCIETY WE SHOULD LIKE TO ASK IF THE FIGURES OF THE ARMY WHICH PROF CARVER USES WITH SUCH APPROVAL ARE NOT THE PERFECT PICTURE OF THE SOCIALIZED AS CONTRASTED WITH THE INDIVIDUALISTIC GROUP WHEREIN ALL COMPETITION BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS COMPOSING THE GROUP FOR PURELY INDIVIDUAL ENDS IS ELIMINATED IN FAVOR OF A RIGOROUS COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISE FOR THE SOCIAL ENDS WE SHOULD LIKE TO QUESTION THE PROFESSORS CYNICAL DISTRUST OF DEMOCRACY HIS UTTER LACK OF SYMPATHY WITH THE ASPIRATIONS OF LABOR HIS CONTEMPTUOUS CONSIGNMENT OF THE POOR TO THE RUBBISH HEAP AS THOSE WHO HAVE NOT MET THE ECONOMIC TEST OF PERFORMANCE AND ARE THEREFORE NOT WORTH THEIR KEEP ESPECIALLY SHOULD WE LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO COMPARE THIS STATEMENT OF THE OLD PHILOSOPHY OF INDIVIDUALISM WITH THE NEW PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIALIZATION AS FORECASTED IF NOT ACTUALLY SET FORTH AND JUSTI FIED BY PROF TAUSSIGS REMARKABLE PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY BUT FOR ALL THIS WE HAVE NO SPACE WE MUST BE CONTENT WITH POINTING OUT THAT PROF CARVER HAS ANSWERED THE CHARGE THAT CAPITALISM IS INEFFICIENT BY REAFFIRMING THE OLD PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMIC COMPETITION AND IS FAR FROM CONVINCING IN HIS STATE MENT OF MORE IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO US IS THE AUTHORS ANSWER TO THE SECOND CHARGE THAT CAPITALISM IS IMMORAL AND IRRELIGIOUSUNCHRISTIAN WE MIGHT ADDWHICH 314RELIGIONS REPLY TO ECONOMICS CONSTITUTES THE REAL BURDEN OF HIS MESSAGE PROF CARVER MEETS THIS INDICTMENT BY REDEFINING RELIGION IN TERMS OF HIS POLITICAL ECONOMY THAT IS THE BEST RELI GION HE SAYS WHICH 1 ACTS MOST POWERFULLY AS A SPUR TO ENERGY AND 2 DIRECTS THAT ENERGY MOST PRODUCTIVELY THE RELIGION WORTH HAVING HE SAYS IN ANOTHER PLACE IS THE RELIGION WHICH WILL ENABLE ITS ADHERENTS TO BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY AND PEOPLE THE EARTH AND SUBDUE IT AND HAVE DOMINION OVER IT THE RELIGION WORTH HAVING IS THE RELIGION WHICH ENABLES THE PEOPLE AND NATIONS WHICH ADOPT IT TO SURVIVE IN COMPETITION WITH PEOPLES AND NATIONS POSSESSING ANY OTHER GIFT OF RELIGION THE RELIGION IS NOT WORTH HAVING WHICH BRINGS FAILURE IN THIS PHYSICAL AND PRACTICAL SENSE WHICH WOULD UNFIT FOR THE STRUGGLE FOR DOMINION THE PEOPLES AND NATIONS WHICH ADOPT IT AND CAUSE THEM TO SUCCUMB TO THE SUPERIOR SURVIVING POWER OF OTHER PEOPLES THE GOSPEL OF RELIGION IN OTHER WORDS IS THE WORK BENCH GOSPEL WHICH FOSTERS PRODUCTIVE ENERGY AND THE GREAT SIN AGAINST WHICH SUCH A GOSPEL MUST BE DIRECTED IS THAT OF THE PIGTROUGH WHICH TEMPTS MEN TO ENJOY RATHER THAN TO PRODUCE THE TRUE CHURCH IS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE PRO DUCTIVE LIFE AND THAT THIS CHURCH WILL BE SEPARATED FROM THE MASSES IS A NORMAL AND ECONOMIC RESULT SINCE PEOPLE WITH SUCH A RELIGION COULD SCARCELY HELP PROSPERING OUT OF PROPORTION TO PEOPLES WHO WASTE THEIR ENERGIES IN SIN AND DISSIPATION THIS ASPECT OF THE SEPARATION OF THE CHURCH FROM THE MASSES SAYS PROF CARVER IS DISPLEASING TO THOSE WHO ARE BEATEN AND THEIR NATURAL RESOURCE IS TALK MUCKRAKING AND PALAVER THAT THIS STATEMENT IS ONE OF AMAZING INTEREST AND VALUE GOES WITHOUT SAYING HERE WE HAVE A PERFECTLY FRANK AND UNBLUSHING ATTEMPT TO DEFINE THE RELIGION OF CAPITALISM NOT IN THE STRANGE TERMS OF A THEOLOGY BUT IN ITS OWN FAMILIAR TERMS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY AND THAT THIS DEFINITION SOUNDS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE THE PROMISE OF SATAN WHEN HE REVEALED TO CHRIST THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD AND ALL THE GLORY OF THEM IS NOT PERHAPS SURPRISING HERE IT SEEMS TO ME WE HAVE A MORE IM PRESSIVE PROOF OF THE ESSENTIALLY IRRELIGIOUS CHARACTER OF THE COMPETITIVE SYSTEM OF INDUSTRY AND ITS UTTER INCOMPATIBILITY WITH THE RELIGION OF JESUS THAN CAN BE FOUND IN ANY OF THE WRITINGS OF THOSE WHO ARE OUTANDOUT OPPONENTS OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS HERE IS A RELIGION WHICH SEES NOTHING MORE IN THE INDIVIDUAL THAN A WORKER WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS TO PRODUCE AND THEN USE THE SURPLUS OF HIS PRODUCTION FOR FURTHER PRODUCTIVE ACHIEVEMENT FOR A FURTHER CONQUEST OF THE FORCES OF NATURE AND AN EXTENSION OF DOMINION OVER THE WORLD HERE IS A RELIGION WHICH DEFINES SUCCESS IN HUMAN LIVING AS A PRODUCTION OF A SURPLUS OF MATERIAL THINGS OVER AND ABOVE WHAT IS NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN LIFE AND A FAILURE IN HUMAN LIVING AS THE PRODUCTION OF MERELY ENOUGH FOR PERSONAL SUSTENANCE OR LESS PROF CARVERS RELIGION IN SHORT KNOWS NOTHING IN THE TEACHING OF JESUS BUT THE PARABLE OF THE TALENTS AND FINDS IN THIS THE SUMMATION OF THE CHRISTIAN GOSPEL IT IS A RELIGION WHICH FOSTERS THE PREJUDICE OF RANK THE PRIDE OF CLASS AND ALL THE STUPID PRETENSIONS OF POLITICAL AND INDUSTRIAL ARISTOCRACYA RELIGION OF THE STRONG THE UNSCRUPULOUS THE PROUD BUT THAT IT IS A RELIGION WORTH HAVING OR IN THE LAST ANALYSIS ANY RELIGION AT ALL I WOULD STEADFASTLY DENY RELIGION HAS TO DO ULTIMATELY WITH SPIRITUAL AND NOT MATERIAL THINGS OR RATHER IT HAS TO DO WITH MATERIAL THINGS ONLY AS THEY AFFECT THE SPIRITUAL REALITIES OF LIFE WHICH IS OF COURSE VERY NEARLY RELIGION IS INTERESTED NOT IN A MANS MATERIAL SUCCESS BUT IN HIS SPIRITUAL INTEGRITY RELIGION CAN BE QUITE CONTENT IF A MAN FAILS TO GAIN ANY 315316 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PART OF THE WORLD IF ONLY HE SAVES HIS OWN SOUL RELIGION DOES NOT STOP WITH THE PARABLE OF THE TALENTS BUT PASSES ON TO OTHER AND HIGHER TRUTHS WHICH SPRINKLE THE GOSPEL PAGES FROM MATTHEW 1 TO JOHN 23 RELIGION BELIEVES THAT THE WORK BENCH PHILOSOPHY IS SOUND AND GOOD SO FAR AS IT GOES BUT IT BELIEVES THAT ABOVE AND BEYOND THIS IS THE FAMILY OR HOME PHILOSOPHY WHICH REPRESENTS MEN NOT SO MUCH AS TOILERS COMPETING AT THE WORKBENCH AS BROTHERS IN A HOME LIVING IN THE IDEAL OF FROM EACH ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS NEED RELIGION LET ME EMPHASIZE AGAIN MUST BE AS PRACTICAL AS PROF CARVER WOULD HAVE IT IT MUST CONCERN ITSELF VERY IMMEDIATELY WITH THE WORLD IN 11 ITS INDUS TRIAL AND POLITICAL PHASES BUT THI3 IT MUST DO NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CAPTURING AND CONTROLLING THE WORLD AS IT IS BUT RATHER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REMAKING IT REFORMING IT REFASHIONING IT AFTER THE HEARTS DESIRE THAT THE BODIES OF MEN MAY NOT BE BRUISED AND THE SOULS OF MEN DESTROYED WHAT TRUE RELIGION WANTS IS NOT DOMINION FOR THE SAKE OF FURTHER CONQUEST BUT DOMINION ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF SOULEMANCIPATION MEN MUST BE FREE TO REALIZE THE DIVINE POSSIBILITIES OF THEIR BEINGS THEY MUST BE FREE TO GROW AND ASPIRE AND LOVE JOHN

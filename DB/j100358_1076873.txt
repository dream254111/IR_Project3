NUMBER 7 THE ENGLISH PARISH AND EDUCATION AT THE BEGINNING OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION CARL RUSSELL FISK University of Wisconsin Many of the Englishmen who came to America in the first half of the seventeenth century were personally familiar with the rural economy of the manor Some had been members of the old city companies some of the newly rising stock companies and a few had taken part in borough or county government All of them had belonged to some parish and while there was a very great diversity in the form of parish government to belong to a parish meant nearly everywhere to take part in its activities The Complete Parish Officer as late as 1772 described the vestry as the assembly of the whole parish Of course the whole parish did not include every inhabitant in the modern sense but it was broad enough to bring in most of those who played any prominent part in setting up the institutions of the New World2 In I772 this description was in general only technically true and the vestry actually consisted in most cases of a few gentlemen The notes upon which this study is based were for the most part gathered in England during I903 In addition to the material printed and manuscript in the British Museum many manuscript parish records of the eastern counties were exam ined The results were so incomplete for the purpose intended that nothing was done with them This article is offered not as in any way exhaustive but merely as sug gestive and illustrative 2 The Complete Parish Officer London I772 I6th ed p I74 433THE SCHOOL REVIEW who filled their own vacancies There is however abundant evidence that at the time of the migration it represented a living fact Thus the Record Book of Parish Proceedings of St Margarets Lothbury opens in I57I Ordinances mad by the hole consent of the parishiners In 1583 the churchwardens accounts of Lindfield contain the item The whole pishe hathe consented and the chefest in the name of the rest whose names are under written to make a Landscott for a repacions of the Churche2 In 1599 at HoughtonleSpring it was agreed by the gentlemen and the XXIIIj of this parish3 The business for which the whole parish was called upon to act was sometimes the raising of a rate as at Lindfield4 or at KirtonLindsay in Lincoln where in I557 yt was agreed by hole bodye of the paryshe to give for every plough i peck of peas and for every plough i bundell of barlye to be sowne to the common use of the towns Such rateraising however seems to have been only occasional and the chief business of the parish meeting was the election of officers The most important of these were the two wardens The London custom at this time was for the parish to choose one one year and one the next6 While the consent of the rector or vicar was apparently necessary and differences of method existed it seems that at this period such election at parish meeting was general As in the case of some New England town offices refusal to serve sometimes was the occasion of a fine7 Other officers x The Vestry Minute Books of Saint Margaret Lothbury edited by Edwin Fresh field London I887 I 2 Sussex Archeological Society Collections XIX 40 3

THE AMERICAN COLONIES were also properly chosen by the parish as the Sidesmen The most important elections however at the time the first American colonists were growing up were not of officers but of a committee In Morebath as early as I527 the four or the five or the nine were chosen to govern the parish in all causes concerning the wealth of the church2 As the Complete Parish Officer says In large populous parishes a custom has obtained of yearly chusing a certain number of the chiefest and most reputable men to represent the rest3 This number was often twentyfour4 sometimes twelve5 sometimes six5 These committees or select vestries with their general representative functions resembling so exactly those of the select men of the New England town were destined to absorb the powers of the whole parish and to exclude the remainder of the parish ioners from all participation in affairs In fact parish organization was after I615 the subject of much discussion In 1637 a ques tionnaire of ten pages concerning the powers of parishes was sent out to the Justices of the Peace6 In I636 the parish of St Peters at Ipswich paid ten shillings to counsel to be advised  whether a parrish paying tyethes in kinde coulde be compelled to make a rate or not7 The central authorities seem to have favored the transition to the less popular system In I619 a document said to be by order

more are to form a select vestry as this meeting has become noisy and illconducted This direction however apparently was not followed2 and in general during this period open parish meetings freely electing assistants or select vestries seem to have been the rule3 As the parish organization had important resemblances to that of the New England town so did its functions Not that they were by any means as extensive In England the clergyman the head of the parish came by the dispensation if not of heaven at least except where the feofee system had brought emancipation4 by that of outside forces supposed to be its representatives His support was derived from tithes that seemed of geologic perma nence The parish did not possess as did the New England town resources of unused land It was nearly always totally apart as the New England town was not for many years from the agri cultural system It was not generally responsible for roads and bridges It inherited in most cases the plant of its main business religion in the church parsonage and attendant necessities Yet enough remained to excite a reasonable concern among those charged with its affairs The day of providing elaborate vestments and jeweled chalices5 had passed away long before but that of Morris plays on the expense side6 and of the sale of church bread and ale on that of income7 vanished within the memory of the

EDUCATION IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES the parish had a vicar instead of a rector it was responsible for delapidations and entries for repairs are numerous It had a responsibility of declining importance

the woman who served him and of whom the vestry was suspicious7 1 Hall St Alphage p 31 1609 Shropshire Archeological and Natural History Society Transactions II 117 Rev J C Cox and W H St J HopeThe

these objects was derived from many sources from the rent of property from such business enterprises as have been mentioned as bread and alemaking and agricultural undertakings from fees and from fines It was becoming more customary however though it had long been a practice to raise sums by a rate or tax levy Thus in 1585 St Christopher Le Stocks raised a rate for a suit for the soldier2 in 160I2 the warden of St Martins Leicester receaved of the leavie that was made the XXViith day of July to paye Certain debts that the pish was in ViiiiL xs v jd3 In 1654 the same parish agreed that the lands of the inhabitants be taxed for setting the poor on work for the relief of the impotent and for putting forth apprentices4 This latter tax must not be confused with the regular poor rate which after I60o was imposed under national direction and did not pass through the hands of the parish organ ization we are considering This law of I60o establishing in each parish a separate organ ization to take over a work so constant and so important as that of the relief of the poor did much to preserve the importance of the parish as an administrative unit but it was also doubtless one of the causes for the gradual atrophy of the popular elements in the older organization It will be noticed that the activities of the regular parish authorities while numerous were becoming less important and of less popular interest than they had been Few of its business enterprises survived far into the seventeenth century and with the rise of Puritanism the church was becoming less and less a social center for the amusements of its people and was tending to become more absorbed in its purely ecclesiastical duties and occasional charities Enough memory of older activi ties remained to make a similar organization reinforced as it was Archeologia XXXV 413 churchwardens accounts of Minchinhampton Gloucester Historical MSS Commission Great Britain 3d Report pp 33132 Shropshire Arch and Nat

New Englanders who added to its duties those of the less popular manorial organization and under favoring geographical conditions some of the functions of the more aristocratically governed counties In England however the popular system of parish government seemed doomed alike by pressure from above and by lack of vital interest to hold the attention of the people In this situation there remained one factor that might possibly have infused it with new lifethe control of education The period of the rise of Protestantism was at least syn chronous with an increasing interest in the education of the common people Considering the close connection between Scotch Protes tant thought and that of the founders of New England it is not too far afield to observe the educational movements in that country In 1560 the first book of discipline of the Reformed Church dis cussed the necessitie of Schools every kirk should have one schoolmaster able to teach grammar and the Latin tongue if the town be of any reputation if it be upland the reader or minis ter must take care of the children and youth of the parish to instruct them in the first rudiments and the education of the poor was to be provided for In i6i6 the Privy Council issued a decree that was ratified by Parliament in 1633 that the bishops with the assent of the freeholders might impose a local Cury for education On December 17 and i8 1638 four years before the famous Massachusetts law the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland resolved Anent the planting of Schools in Land ward the want thereof doth greatly prejudge the growth of the Gospel and procure the decay of Religion the Assembly giveth direction to the several Presbyteries for the setling of Schools in every landward parochin and providing of men able for the charge of teaching of the youth publick reading and precenting of the Psalme and catachising of the common people and that means be provided for their entertainment in the most convenient manner that may be had according to the abilitie of the Parochin2 Lord John Russell Letter on the Parochial Schools of Scotland London I854 2The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland The Principal Acts Edinburgh 1639 439THE SCHOOL REVIEW This ideal was not recognized by the Scotch Parliament until i6961 but it was a notable declaration of intention A Project of the Plantation of Ulster of I606 in the Carew MSS includes provision for a college at Dublin2 and some sepa rate suggestions without date in the same hand run to plant husbandry and every man that keeps 20 cows to keep a plough land to plant artificers and markets to plant schoolmasters in every parish for the first elements in every country or borough for further learning of the sciences and an ordinance for every noble and gentleman to put their children to learning3 James I wrote St John February 26 I620 that a competent portion of land for the maintenance of free schools in every county of Ulster was to be provided before natives and undertakers4 In England there was interest in education In I542 Bonner bishop of London enjoined every of you that be parsons vicars curates and also chantry priests and stipendiaries to  teach and bring up in learning the best ye can all such children of your parishioners as shall come to you or at the least teach them to read English In 1563 all schoolmasters and public and private teachers of children were required to take the oath of allegiance All schoolmasters were expected to have licenses from their bishops In 1597 parliamentary supervision was suggested in a bill for establishing of good Orders in Grammar Schools but it was rejected5 Nor did the leaders of centralization under Charles I overlook the subject Strafford wrote on March II 1633 that there are not many men which deserve better or worse of the State than the Schoolmasters and that severity was needed to I Rev W W Hetherington History of the Church of Scotland Edinburgh 1842 p 304 see

send to London for trial Christopher Sands who taught an English school in Londonderry as he is a Jew and denies Christ3 In 1657 Laud reported to the king At Biddenden I have suspended Richard Warren ye School Master for refusing the Oath  Besides this precise man will read of nothing but Divinity to his Schollars noe not soe much as ye Grammar rules unless Mars Bacchus Apollo  maybe blotted out4 Licenses and oaths however have never proved sufficient of themselves for the efficient control of a countrywide institution and the bishops were too busy with other matters to follow up the schools The pur pose of both license and oath moreover was almost wholly to secure religious orthodoxy and not to provide for education or to regulate its general content or method The various rulers did something by the establishment of schools but these were occa sional and scattered benefits and belong rather to the category of private benefactions than of governmental provisions In fact neither Parliament nor the Crown devised any systematic organ ization for the general support or supervision of education The task was left to the care of individuals and of local governing bodies How much private benefaction did toward a solution of the problem may be seen in the successive reports of the commis sioners whose appointment was provided for by Lord Broughams bill of I816 to inquire concerning charities in England for the education of the Poor These reports continuing for twenty years and running to over thirty volumes5 are a constant illustra tion of the wonderful diversity of schemes which English individual ity can devise when left to run wild but they are equally impressive for revealing the multitude of the endowments founded in the I Thomas Earl of Strafford Letters

seventeenth centuries and the wide area that they covered Particularly noticeable is the liberality of the great city companies of London the Mercers the Grocers the Girdlers the Brewers the Clothworkers the Skinners the Gold smiths the Merchant Tailors all of which appear as founders of schools This stream of private munificence did not however serve of itself to meet the need It was unequally distributed geograph ically and it tended to multiply secondary grammar or Latin schools rather than those for the elements Local responsibility still remained and in many cases was stimulated by the gifts In nearly every instance the parish was the unit to which its gift applied or if more than one parish was to be benefited it was in a fixed proportion In some instances moreover the endowment was the result of collective local effort that kind of extralegal cooperation which had developed the local sense of responsibility in the case of the poor law and so paved the way for the compulsory rating of i60o and which has of recent years resulted in the grafting of so many new branches of expenditure upon the public purse More important the administration of the gifts was often thrown upon the authorities of the parish In 1560 the corpora tion of the grammar school of Sevenoaks in Kent consisted of the Warden and Four assistants2 In 1616 the Skinners provided twenty pounds for a schoolmaster at Hackney in Middle sex to be appointed by the vicar churchwardens and twelve substantial householders3 In 1532 a free school was given for Horsham in Sussex to be managed by the executors vicar churchwardens and four of the most honest men in the parish indifferently chosen by the inhabitants4 In 1612 the Commis I For instance at Godmanchester in 156I the

on Charitable Uses assigned certain funds for the benefit of the poor and poor children of Hanwell Middlesex  at the discretion of the feofees and parish officers In I637 the Grocers provided twelve pence a week each for poor children of Acton Middlesex to learn English which was to be managed by the minister and churchwardens In the case of elementary schools private initiative from eco nomic motives was more important than that from charity alone Though most schools were free this freedom meant merely that they were open without distinction to all who complied with their conditions In practically all schools high and low fees were charged In many of those which were endowed to be sure free instruction and sometimes maintenance was provided for a fixed number of poor children but from the greater proportion of pupils payment was exacted These fees were sufficient in most of the more important parishes to induce schoolmasters to set up elementary schools and in the smaller ones to console the vicar for undertaking the task Sometimes a curate or a clerk or the vicars reader served as schoolmaster In such cases however as in the case of the endowed institution the parish authorities very often became involved Here and there the school was a source of profit to the parish The school was nearly always held in some parish building and occasionally paid rent as at Ashburton where in 1573 the minister paid Xs iiid for the occupation of the church house  for the keeping of scule there3 At Hempstead from I599 to I6I7 the Schollmaster or scoolmayst and usher paid towards the Towllinge of the Schollers Bell4 This was however exceptional and the parish generally furnished the schoolroom free and often at some expense to itself In many cases the school was held

Leicester7 was possibly for Sunday use only as the schoolmaster was expected to bring them to the parish service8 The convenience of a separate schoolhouse was however appreciated and by one means or another the parishes were grad ually equipping themselves with them Between I500 and 1521 the churchwardens of Wigloft in Lincoln spent money for the improvement and repair of the schoolhouse although

1598 a benefactor at Hingham in Somerset gave a sum for the encouragement of a schoolmaster to instruct the poor children of the parish and the parish pro vided the house In 1609 a similar arrangement was made at Lancton Yorkshire2 At Uxbridge in Middlesex a bequest of twenty marks in I570 on condition that the town erect within the year a schoolhouse and provide additional endowment failed to produce action on the part of the town3 The schoolhouse did not solve all problems In 1640 the Commissioners of Charitable Uses found that no schoolmaster would undertake the teaching of poor children at Haskingfield in Cambridgeshire unless some certain allowance might be assured him4 and this was a condition that often existed A second prob lem was that of poor children whose parents were not able to breed them up to school by means of poverty of whom we find record in almost every parish Where private charity failed to provide for these emergencies the joint responsibility was begin ning here and there to be felt St Michael Cornhill in 1569 paid Robert Morcocke who taught chylderyne for his hole yeres wages xi s and to the Clarke yt teacheth chyldren x s5 In 156i at Cratfield the

Bartholemews Exchange solved the difficulty in another way by paying the pettye schulemaster of Christs Hospital for the instruction of poor children At St Mary Woolworth in I6I6 five shillings were paid to the scole mistress2 In 1629 the Bishop of Bristol granted permission for building the shops at the West end of the church of the Holy Trinity Dorchester for the use of the poor for the training up of Children in the Eng lish tongue3 In 1636 such expenses ran to over twenty pounds4 In I636 the churchwardens and the twentyfour at Cartmel ordered that Christopher Barrow come to teach

SCHOOL REVIEW In the absence of national control it is apparent that there was no such thing as a system of educational support in England at the time of the American migration Secondary schools were sustained in larger measure by endowment than by any other means Elementary schools were primarily dependent upon the scholars fees This individual effort was supplemented however by the various local authorities the borough the towns some times separate from sometimes identical with the parish2 the lord of the manor3 the overseers of the poor4 the justices5 and the authorities officers or inhabitants of the parish as well as by private corporations such as the great London companies This complication of support was balanced by a similar complication in control It was the parish however which was most fre quently and closely connected with elementary education If the fees were not sufficient to encourage a schoolmaster to settle the vicar the curate the clerk or some other officer was on the spot mainly supported by his other occupation to fill the gap in return for a sum which if not sufficient to live upon was not unwelcome as an addition to his income Doubtless many vicars received the parish poor children without fee The school was nearly always in a parish building and the responsibility for providing a meeting place for it was generally recognized as a parish duty Probably the statesmen of England were correct in judging that the sense of community responsibility for the education of the poor See 3I Ed Rept 1837 Town of Wisbeck Edward VI also 2d Ed Rept 1835 15

of so many poor boys as the justices and churchwardens with the overseers of the poor shall agree for with the schoolmaster 9 Ed Rept 1823 i6o6 448ENGLISH EDUCATION IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES was not as highly developed as that for their support and that pub lic opinion would not uphold such a plan for national compulsion as that involved in the poor law of I60o In part this was due to the fact that the needs of the situation as far as the more powerful elements in the population were concerned seemed fairly well met In most parishes the scholars bell summoned the children of all who could pay to the daily lesson in a large number of them it summoned also all children whom their parents judged could be spared from home whose tuition was provided for by reason of old endowments or by special charity or by parochial care It is apart from the purpose of the article to point out the con nection of such plans as that for the reservation of lands in Ulster with the similar early and continued practice in the United States or of the corporate generosity of the London merchants with that of the early colonizing companies More significant and more important are the signs of a dawning consciousness of community responsibility It is evident that though public opinion was not ready under English conditions to assume the burden of granting universal opportunity by a national system of compulsory support much less that of making the acceptance of this opportunity itself compulsory nevertheless the feeling was developing that in the absence of other means the local unit was responsible for providing the opportunity by its own initiative and that the unit upon which this responsibility logically rested was that of which the control was most responsive to the popular will the parish Nor was there any objection to this on the ground of confusing secular and religious functions The idea of free education in cases of necessity was in the air but not that of separation of church and state4 It did not therefore seem strange to the inhabitants of the more vigorous daughter of the parish the New England town that in a country where private endowments could not be counted upon and where public land endowments brought in little or no return the town should be required to see to it that a schoolhouse be pro vided a schoolmaster encouraged to engage in the work and the children of the poor be educated at town expense 4 Note also the importance of the cathedral and other choir schools see Docu ments Illustrating Early Education in Worcester 685 to 1700 edited by A F

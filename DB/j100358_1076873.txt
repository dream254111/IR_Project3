NUMBER 7 THE ENGLISH PARISH AND EDUCATION AT THE BEGINNING OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION CARL RUSSELL FISK UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MANY OF THE ENGLISHMEN WHO CAME TO AMERICA IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WERE PERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE RURAL ECONOMY OF THE MANOR SOME HAD BEEN MEMBERS OF THE OLD CITY COMPANIES SOME OF THE NEWLY RISING STOCK COMPANIES AND A FEW HAD TAKEN PART IN BOROUGH OR COUNTY GOVERNMENT ALL OF THEM HAD BELONGED TO SOME PARISH AND WHILE THERE WAS A VERY GREAT DIVERSITY IN THE FORM OF PARISH GOVERNMENT TO BELONG TO A PARISH MEANT NEARLY EVERYWHERE TO TAKE PART IN ITS ACTIVITIES THE COMPLETE PARISH OFFICER AS LATE AS 1772 DESCRIBED THE VESTRY AS THE ASSEMBLY OF THE WHOLE PARISH OF COURSE THE WHOLE PARISH DID NOT INCLUDE EVERY INHABITANT IN THE MODERN SENSE BUT IT WAS BROAD ENOUGH TO BRING IN MOST OF THOSE WHO PLAYED ANY PROMINENT PART IN SETTING UP THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE NEW WORLD2 IN I772 THIS DESCRIPTION WAS IN GENERAL ONLY TECHNICALLY TRUE AND THE VESTRY ACTUALLY CONSISTED IN MOST CASES OF A FEW GENTLEMEN THE NOTES UPON WHICH THIS STUDY IS BASED WERE FOR THE MOST PART GATHERED IN ENGLAND DURING I903 IN ADDITION TO THE MATERIAL PRINTED AND MANUSCRIPT IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM MANY MANUSCRIPT PARISH RECORDS OF THE EASTERN COUNTIES WERE EXAM INED THE RESULTS WERE SO INCOMPLETE FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED THAT NOTHING WAS DONE WITH THEM THIS

LANDS OF THE INHABITANTS BE TAXED FOR SETTING THE POOR ON WORK FOR THE RELIEF OF THE IMPOTENT AND FOR PUTTING FORTH APPRENTICES4 THIS LATTER TAX MUST NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE REGULAR POOR RATE WHICH AFTER I60O WAS IMPOSED UNDER NATIONAL DIRECTION AND DID NOT PASS THROUGH THE HANDS OF THE PARISH ORGAN IZATION WE ARE CONSIDERING THIS LAW OF I60O ESTABLISHING IN EACH PARISH A SEPARATE ORGAN IZATION TO TAKE OVER A WORK SO CONSTANT AND SO IMPORTANT AS THAT OF THE RELIEF OF THE POOR DID MUCH TO PRESERVE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PARISH AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT BUT IT WAS ALSO DOUBTLESS ONE OF THE CAUSES FOR THE GRADUAL ATROPHY OF THE POPULAR ELEMENTS IN THE OLDER ORGANIZATION IT WILL BE NOTICED THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE REGULAR PARISH AUTHORITIES WHILE NUMEROUS WERE BECOMING LESS IMPORTANT AND OF LESS POPULAR INTEREST THAN THEY HAD BEEN FEW OF ITS BUSINESS ENTERPRISES SURVIVED FAR INTO THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND WITH THE RISE OF PURITANISM THE CHURCH WAS BECOMING LESS AND LESS A SOCIAL CENTER FOR THE AMUSEMENTS OF ITS PEOPLE AND WAS TENDING TO BECOME MORE ABSORBED IN ITS PURELY ECCLESIASTICAL DUTIES AND OCCASIONAL CHARITIES ENOUGH MEMORY OF OLDER ACTIVI TIES REMAINED TO MAKE A

SCHOOL REVIEW IN THE ABSENCE OF NATIONAL CONTROL IT IS APPARENT THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A SYSTEM OF EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT IN ENGLAND AT THE TIME OF THE AMERICAN MIGRATION SECONDARY SCHOOLS WERE SUSTAINED IN LARGER MEASURE BY ENDOWMENT THAN BY ANY OTHER MEANS ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WERE PRIMARILY DEPENDENT UPON THE SCHOLARS FEES THIS INDIVIDUAL EFFORT WAS SUPPLEMENTED HOWEVER BY THE VARIOUS LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE BOROUGH THE TOWNS SOME TIMES SEPARATE FROM SOMETIMES IDENTICAL WITH THE PARISH2 THE LORD OF THE MANOR3 THE OVERSEERS OF THE POOR4 THE JUSTICES5 AND THE AUTHORITIES OFFICERS OR INHABITANTS OF THE PARISH AS WELL AS BY PRIVATE CORPORATIONS SUCH AS THE GREAT LONDON COMPANIES THIS COMPLICATION OF SUPPORT WAS BALANCED BY A SIMILAR COMPLICATION IN CONTROL IT WAS THE PARISH HOWEVER WHICH WAS MOST FRE QUENTLY AND CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IF THE FEES WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENCOURAGE A SCHOOLMASTER TO SETTLE THE VICAR THE CURATE THE CLERK OR SOME OTHER OFFICER WAS ON THE SPOT MAINLY SUPPORTED BY HIS OTHER OCCUPATION TO FILL THE GAP IN RETURN FOR A SUM WHICH IF NOT SUFFICIENT TO LIVE UPON WAS NOT UNWELCOME AS AN ADDITION TO HIS INCOME DOUBTLESS MANY VICARS RECEIVED THE PARISH POOR CHILDREN WITHOUT FEE THE SCHOOL WAS NEARLY ALWAYS IN A PARISH BUILDING AND THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING A MEETING PLACE FOR IT WAS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS A PARISH DUTY

OF SO MANY POOR BOYS AS THE JUSTICES AND CHURCHWARDENS WITH THE OVERSEERS OF THE POOR SHALL AGREE FOR WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER 9 ED REPT 1823 I6O6 448ENGLISH EDUCATION IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES WAS NOT AS HIGHLY DEVELOPED AS THAT FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND THAT PUB LIC OPINION WOULD NOT UPHOLD SUCH A PLAN FOR NATIONAL COMPULSION AS THAT INVOLVED IN THE POOR LAW OF I60O IN PART THIS WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE NEEDS OF THE SITUATION AS FAR AS THE MORE POWERFUL ELEMENTS IN THE POPULATION WERE CONCERNED SEEMED FAIRLY WELL MET IN MOST PARISHES THE SCHOLARS BELL SUMMONED THE CHILDREN OF ALL WHO COULD PAY TO THE DAILY LESSON IN A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM IT SUMMONED ALSO ALL CHILDREN WHOM THEIR PARENTS JUDGED COULD BE SPARED FROM HOME WHOSE TUITION WAS PROVIDED FOR BY REASON OF OLD ENDOWMENTS OR BY SPECIAL CHARITY OR BY PAROCHIAL CARE IT IS APART FROM THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE TO POINT OUT THE CON NECTION OF SUCH PLANS AS THAT FOR THE RESERVATION OF LANDS IN ULSTER WITH THE SIMILAR EARLY AND CONTINUED PRACTICE IN THE UNITED STATES OR OF THE CORPORATE GENEROSITY OF THE LONDON MERCHANTS WITH THAT OF THE EARLY COLONIZING COMPANIES MORE SIGNIFICANT AND MORE IMPORTANT ARE THE SIGNS OF A DAWNING CONSCIOUSNESS OF COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITY IT IS EVIDENT THAT THOUGH PUBLIC OPINION WAS NOT READY UNDER ENGLISH CONDITIONS TO ASSUME THE BURDEN OF GRANTING UNIVERSAL OPPORTUNITY BY A NATIONAL SYSTEM OF COMPULSORY SUPPORT MUCH LESS THAT OF MAKING THE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY ITSELF COMPULSORY NEVERTHELESS THE FEELING WAS DEVELOPING THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF OTHER MEANS THE LOCAL UNIT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY BY ITS OWN INITIATIVE AND THAT THE UNIT UPON WHICH THIS RESPONSIBILITY LOGICALLY RESTED WAS THAT OF WHICH THE CONTROL WAS MOST RESPONSIVE TO THE POPULAR WILL THE PARISH NOR WAS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO THIS ON THE GROUND OF CONFUSING SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS FUNCTIONS THE IDEA OF FREE EDUCATION IN CASES OF NECESSITY WAS IN THE AIR BUT NOT THAT OF SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE4 IT DID NOT THEREFORE SEEM STRANGE TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE MORE VIGOROUS DAUGHTER OF THE PARISH THE NEW ENGLAND TOWN THAT IN A COUNTRY WHERE PRIVATE ENDOWMENTS COULD NOT BE COUNTED UPON AND WHERE PUBLIC LAND ENDOWMENTS BROUGHT IN LITTLE OR NO RETURN THE TOWN SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEE TO IT THAT A SCHOOLHOUSE BE PRO VIDED A SCHOOLMASTER ENCOURAGED TO ENGAGE IN THE WORK AND THE

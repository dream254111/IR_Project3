that he was sent to buy a cow for a butcher whose agent he claimed to be They agreed on a price of twentyeight dollars and the defendant led the prosecutors cow away Later instead of paying the money the defendant presented to the prosecutor a judgment against him for fifty dollars which had been assigned to the defendant Held that the defendant cannot be convicted of obtaining property by false pretenses State v Williams 69 S E 474 W Va To convict for obtaining money or goods by false pretenses a specific intent to defraud must be proved People v Baker 96 N Y 340 So if the defendant bond fide believed that he had a right to obtain the money or goods from the prosecutor the intent to defraud was absent Rex v Williams 7 C  P 354 See The Queen v Hamilton I Cox C C 244 247 A misunderstanding of the Williams case has led to the frequent statement of a broad rule that one who by a false pretense procures another to pay a debt already due does notcom mit this statutory crime because no injury is done See 2 BISHOP CRIMINAL LAW 8 ed  466 2 WHARTON CRIMINAL LAW 8 ed  II97 This may be true where the debtor intends to pay the debt and knows that he is doing so People v Thomas

example the debtor has been defrauded People v Smith 5 Parker Cr Rep N Y 490 Contra State v Hurst II W Va 54 The existence of a debt due the prisoner however may be evidence coupled with other

statute declaring that married women may sue for the recovery security or protection of their prop erty and for torts committed against them as fully and freely as if they were unmarried Held three judges dissenting that the plaintiff cannot recover Thompson v Thompson 218 U S 6II Several courts have reached a like result under similar statutes Freethy v Freethy 42 Barb N Y 641 Peters v Peters

acquire title against him by adverse possession Union Oil Co v Stewart IIo Pac 313 Cal McPherson v McPherson 75 Neb 830 The difficulty is often stated to be more than procedural and to involve the unity of person resulting from marriage Phillips v Barnet I Q B D 436 But this objection has been largely abrogated by statute South wick v Southwick 49 N Y 5Io Burkett v Burkett 78 Cal 3Io Another frequent ground of the decisions is public policy that the sanctity of the home would be undermined and the breach kept open by allowing an action 403HARVARD LAW REVIEW Longendyke v Longendyke 44 Barb N Y 366 The obvious answer is that the breach might never have occurred had an action been imminent In the face of the words of the statute the decision seems a severe application of the rule that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed INSURANCE  NATURE AND INCIDENTS OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS  WHEN RIGHT OF ACTION FOR REVOCATION ACCRUES The defendant company wrongfully cancelled a policy of insurance on the life of A After As death three years later suit was brought on the policy Held that the action lies Baumann v Metropolitan Life Ins Co 128 N W 864 Wis The confusion in the decisions on the effect of repudiation by the insurer upon the insureds right of action on the policy is illustrated by several cases following a companys attempted reduction in the face of its outstanding policies Massachusetts which denies the theory of anticipatory breach of contract held that no action lay until after the death of the insured Porter v American Legion of Honor I83 Mass 326 Newhall v American Legion of Honor I8I Mass II New York unmindful of the anticipatory breach doctrine there followed also denied legal relief during the life of the insured Langan v American Legion of Honor 174 N Y 266 An earlier case permitting immediate recovery was overlooked Fischer v Hope Mutual Life Ins Co 69 N Y I6I New Jersey however held this to be an anticipatory breach and allowed recovery at once ONeill v American Legion of Honor 70 N J L 4I0 An immediate action founded on an actual and not on an anticipatory breach should be given The peculiar nature of life insurance contracts necessitates cooperation on the part of the insurer a contract by the company to accept premiums is implied in fact in every case Hence repudiation and refusal of premiums is a present breach giving rise to an action for damages for the loss of the whole contract and starting the running of the Statute of Limitations WILLISTONS WALDS POLLOCK CONTRACTS 362364 INTERSTATE COMMERCE  CONTROL BY CONGRESS  LIABILITY OF INITIAL CARRIER  The Carmack Amendment provides that in interstate shipments the initial carrier shall issue a bill of lading for the goods and be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss damage or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier railroad or transportation company to which such property may be delivered or over whose line or lines such property may pass notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary and gives the initial carrier an action of indemnity against the one on whose line the loss occurs An interstate shipment was made by the terms of which the receiving rail road the defendant was to be liable only for loss upon its own rails The goods were lost by a connecting carrier The shipper sued the initial carrier Held that the act is constitutional and the plaintiff may recover Atlantic Coast Line R Co v Riverside Mills U S Sup Ct Jan 3 I9II The difficulty of placing the responsibility for the loss and the frequent necessity of suing in a distant jurisdiction put the shipper at a disadvantage and often drive him to accept unfavorable settlements A remedy is here sought under the Commerce clause Gibbons v Ogden 9 Wheat U S i I96 See 20 HARv L REV 481 The facts of the principal case do not raise and the court refrains from considering the difficult question presented by a situation where this statute would seemingly force the first railroad to accept as a potential debtor any connecting line the shipper may designate without regard to the inclination of the first or the solvency of the connecting carrier As a matter of statutory construction it is at least arguable that this should have been considered See The Employers Liability Cases 207 U S 463 50I INTERSTATE COMMERCE  CONTROL BY

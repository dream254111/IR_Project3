INCLOSED LETTER CONTAINS SOME ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVA TIONS WHICH SEEM TO MERIT THE ATTENTION OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY I WISH THEREFORE YOU WOULD LAY IT BEFORE THEM AND AT THE SAME TIME SIGNIFY THAT I HAVE SEEN ALL THE EXPERIMENTS CAREFULLY MADE AND THAT THE SEVERAL FACTS THEREIN CONTAINED ARE FAITHFULLY RELATED I AM READ MAR 22 1759 S I R YOUR MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT B WILSON QUEENSTREET LONDON 22 MARCH 1759 A LETTER FROM EDWARD DELAVAL M A AND FELLOW OF PEMBROKEHALL CAMBRIDGE TO MR BENJAMIN WILSON F R S CONTAINING SOME ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVA TIONS S I R I SEND YOU A FEW ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS AND DESIRE YOUR OPI NION HOW WELL THEY ESTABLISH A CONVERTIBILITY I BE LIEVE HITHERTO UNNOTICED IN MANY SUBSTANCES FROM CONDUCTORS INTO NONCONDUCTORS OF THE ELECTRIC FLUID M 2 I HAVE READ MAR 22 175984 I HAVE FILLED SEVERAL SMALL GLASS TUBES WITH THE DRY POWDERS OF CALCINED METALS VIZ CERUSS LEAD ASHES MINIUM CALX OF ANTIMONY C INTO EACH END OF EVERY TUBE I PUT A PIECE OF IRON WIRE WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH THE CALX AND FASTENED THEM WITH WAX SO THAT THE ELECTRIC FLUID NOT BEING ABLE TO ESCAPE BY MEANS OF THE GLASS MUST EITHER PASS THRO THE CALX OR NOT AT ALL UPON HANGING ONE OF THE WIRES BENT FOR THE PURPOSE TO THE ELECTRIFIED BAR AND HOLDING THE OTHER IN MY HAND I OBSERVED THAT NO ELECTRIC MATTER DID PASS THE CALX THE SNAPS ISSUING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE BAR OR FROM THAT WIRE WHICH WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE BAR  ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE SOLIDS ALSO WHEN REDUCED TO ASHES AND INTERPOSED IN THE SAME MANNER BETWEEN TWO PIECES OF WIRE DO I FIND AS EFFECTUALLY INTER CEPT THE ELECTRIC STREAM AS THE METALLIC CALCES FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS YOU SEE THAT ANIMAL VE GETABLE AND METALLIC BODIES THO SUCH KNOWN CON DUCTORS OF THE ELECTRIC FLUID WHILE IN THEIR INTIRE STATE ARE EASILY CHANGED INTO RESISTERS OR NONCON DUCTORS OF IT I WAS LED TO ATTEMPT THIS CHANGE FROM ITS HAVING BEEN OBSERVED THAT DRY MOULD WOULD NOT CONDUCT THE ELECTRIC FLUID AND FROM THENCE I SUSPECTED THAT ONE CLASS OF THE NONCONDUCTORS MUST OWE ITS PROPERTY TO AN ELECTRICAL VIRTUE THAT WOULD BE FOUND TO RESIDE IN THE CALX OR EARTH OF THE CHYMISTS AFTER IT IS DI VESTED OF THE UNCTUOUS INFLAMMABLE MATTER WHICH  SINCE I WROTE THIS LETTER I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT PART OF THIS FIRST EXPERIMENT RELATING TO METALLIC CALCES HAS BEEN MADE BEFORE BY DR WATSON SEE THE NOTE PHIL TRANS VOL XLV P 107 CONSTI85 CONSTITUTES ANOTHER OF THE CHYMICAL PRINCIPLES CALLED SULPHUR IN LIKE MANNER AS THIS SULPHUR IS CON STANTLY FOUND HIGHLY ELECTRICAL IN ALL BODIES WHERE IT ABOUNDS IN A SOLID FORM VIZ RESINS WAX C THESE EXPERIMENTS APPEAR TO VERIFY MY SUPPOSI TION FOR ALL THE ABOVEMENTIONED SUBSTANCES WHICH WERE THUS CHANGED INTO NONCONDUCTORS CONSIST EITHER WHOLLY OR IN A GREAT MEASURE OF EARTH FREED FROM THE UNCTUOUS INFLAMMABLE PARTICLES THE METALS NOT BEING CALCINEABLE WITHOUT A DEGREE OF HEAT THAT MUST DISSIPATE ALL THEIR SULPHUR AS IS EVIDENT FROM THEIR NOT BEING REDUCIBLE AGAIN INTO THEIR METALLIC FORM WITHOUT THE ADMIXTURE OF SOME UNCTUOUS MATTER AND THE SAME DISSIPATION OF THEIR SULPHUR MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES BEFORE THEY BECOME WHITE ASHES I  NOT AT PRESENT ATTEMPT AN ACCOUNT WHY BODIES CONSISTING OF EITHER OF THESE SUBSTANCES SEPA RATELY ARE ELECTRIC THO IT APPEARS TO ME DEDUCIBLE FROM SOME DOCTRINES OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON BUT ONLY PROPOSE A THOUGHT CONCERNING THE REASON WHY THESE TWO PRINCIPLES CALX AND SULPHUR WHICH ARE KNOWN TO UNITE IN THE COMPOSITION OF ALMOST ALL BODIES SHOULD NOTWITHSTANDING THEY ARE ELECTRIC WHEN SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER BE YET FOUND NON ELECTRIC WHEN UNITED IN ONE BODY IT MUST BE REMEMBRED THAT THERE IS A REMARKABLE AND WELLKNOWN OPPOSITION IN THE ELECTRICAL EFFECTS OF THESE TWO CLASSES THE EARTHY ONE AS GLASS AND STONES ELECTRIFYING PLUS AND THE SULPHUREOUS ONE MINUS DOES IT NOT SEEM THEN A THING TO BE EXPECTED IN A BODY COMPOUNDED OF BOTH THAT THE OPPOSITE POWERS OF THESE INGREDIENTS SHOULD COUNTERBALLANCE AND86 AND DESTROY THE EFFECTS OF EACH OTHER AND THE BODY IN WHICH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ONES EQUALLY PRE VAIL BECOME NEUTRAL OR NONELECTRIC I HAVE NOT SCRUPLED TO RANK THOSE KNOWN POSITIVE ELECTRICS GLASS AND TRANSPARENT STONES UNDER THAT CLASS OF BODIES WHICH CONSISTS OF CALX OR EARTH BECAUSE ALL VITRIFICATIONS MUST PROCEED FROM PREVIOUS CALCINA TIONS AND ALL CALCES MAY BE VITRIFIED IN THE FOCUS OF LARGE BURNINGGLASSES THE TRANSPARENT STONES ALSO CONSIST OF LITTLE MORE THAN PURE EARTH FREE OF THE LEAST MIXTURE OF OIL IF WE MAY JUDGE OF OTHERS BY THE CHYMICAL RESOLUTION OF CRYSTAL THERE IS ANOTHER PROCESS NATURAL AND WITHOUT FIRE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO DESTROY THE SULPHUREOUS SUBSTANCE OF METALS VIZ WHEN THEY ARE CORRODED AND MOULDER IN THE OPEN AIR ACCORDINGLY WITH THE SAME APPARATUS IN WHICH I TRIED THE CALCINATIONS BY FIRE I EXAMINED THE COMMON RUST OF IRON AND FLAKE WHITE WHICH IS THE RUST OF LEAD AND FIND THEM EQUALLY CONVERTED INTO NONCONDUCTORS IN THE OPEN AIR THAT THIS CHANGE IN METALS PARTICULARLY IS NOT OWING TO OR PROMOTED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF MERE PULVERIZATION IS EVIDENT NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE ABOVE MENTIONED CALCES ARE EQUALLY STRONG ELECTRICS WHEN FORMED INTO HARD MASSES WITH A THIN PASTE OF FLOUR AND WATER AND AFTERWARDS DRIED BUT MOST CLEARLY BECAUSE THE FINEST FILINGS OR POWDERS OF METALS CON DUCT AS READILY AS THE INTIRE SUBSTANCES DO I HAVE GLASS TUBES ARMED AS ABOVE AND FILLED WITH THE PRE PARATIONS CALLED POWDER OF TIN C WHICH CONDUCT AS WELL AS A WIRE WHEN IT IS NOT DISCONTINUED BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS CHANGE WILL NOT SUCCEED 9 IN87 IN METALLIC SUBSTANCES UPON MERE PULVERIZATION YET IT SEEMS TO FOLLOW IN MOST OTHER HARD BODIES HAVING DRIED A PIECE OF PORTLAND STONE I FOUND IT CONDUCTED PERFECTLY WELL BUT UPON POWDERING AND SEALING IT UP IN ONE OF THE TUBES WITH THE WIRE ENDS AS ABOVE IT BECAME A PERFECT RESISTER OR NON CONDUCTOR LIKE THE METALLIC CALCES I HAVE TRIED THE SAME EXPERIMENT ON A VARIETY OF OTHER BODIES PARTICULARLY GUM ARABIC AND ALLUM AND HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE IT WILL SUCCEED IN ALL BODIES THAT CAN BE PULVERIZED IN THE MORTAR THESE LAST EXPERIMENTS SEEM TO CONFIRM SIR ISAAC NEWTONS DOCTRINE OF A MEDIUM SURROUNDING ALL BO DIES WHICH YOU HAVE APPLIED TO THE SOLUTION OF ELECTRIC PHAENOMENA AND ARE VERY ANALOGOUS TO THE EXPERI MENTS YOU MADE WITH A CHAIN IN ORDER TO SHEW THAT THE RESISTANCE TO THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRIC FLUID MAY BE INCREASED BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SURFACES ANOTHER VERY EXTRAORDINARY MEANS OF MAKING THIS CHANGE IN BODIES WHICH ABOUND IN CALX OR EARTH IS BY FIRE NOT BY THE INTENSE ONE THAT CALCINES BUT BY A MODERATE HEAT THEIR MOST PERFECT RESISTANCE OR NONCONDUCTING PROPERTY BEING WHEN THEIR HEAT IS JUST TOLERABLE TO OUR HANDS I HAVE SOME OF THE SAME PORTLAND STONE WROUGHT INTO PLATES NEARLY AS THIN AS WINDOWGLASS WHICH I HEAT TO A PROPER DEGREE AND THEN COAT ON BOTH SIDES WITH METAL IN ORDER TO MAKE THE LEYDEN EXPERI MENT WHEN THE STONE IS HOT ENOUGH TO SINGE PAPER IT CONDUCTS AS PERFECTLY AS WHEN COLD BUT ON COOLING A LITTLE IT BEGINS NOT TO CONDUCT AND AFFORDS SMALL SHOCKS WHICH GRADUALLY INCREASE IN STRENGTH FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES AT WHICH TIME IT IS ABOUT ITS MOST PER FECT88 FECT STATE AND REMAINS SO NEAR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTER THAT TIME THE SHOCKS GRADUALLY DECREASE AS THE STONE GROWS COOLER TILL AT LAST THEY QUITE CEASE AND IT RETURNS TO ITS CONDUCTING STATE AGAIN BUT THIS STATE APPEARS BEFORE THE STONE IS QUITE COLD EXPERIMENTS OF THIS KIND SUCCEED IN ALL BODIES ABOUNDING IN CALX OR EARTH AS STONES DRIED CLAY WOOD WHEN ROTTEN OR BURNT IN THE FIRE TILL THE SURFACE BECOMES BLACK AMONG OTHER SUBSTANCES I TRIED A COMMON TOBACCO PIPE PART OF WHICH NEAR THE MIDDLE I HEATED TO A PROPER DEGREE AND THEN APPLIED ONE END OF IT TO THE ELECTRIFIED BAR WHILE THE OTHER WAS HELD IN THE HAND AND I OBSERVED THAT THE ELECTRIC FLUID PASSED NO FARTHER ALONG THE PIPE THAN TO THE HEATED PART TO THESE CHANGES BROUGHT ABOUT WITH SUDDEN VIO LENCE I MUST ADD THE UNIVERSAL CHANGE GOING ON IN ALL ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE SOLIDS AS THEY ARE GROWING DRY NOT ONLY THEIR ASHES RESIST THE PASSAGE OF THE ELECTRIC FLUID BUT THEY OF THEMSELVES ARRIVE AT THIS STATE WHILE YET HARD AND INTIRE AND THAT MUCH SOONER THAN ONE WOULD IMAGINE FOR I HAVE BONES AND HARD WOOD THAT PERFECTLY RESIST THE PASSAGE THO YET CA PABLE OF YIELDING A BRIGHT FLAME BUT SCARCE A VISIBLE SMOKE SO THAT BESIDES AN EVAPORATION OF THEIR MOISTURE BUT A PARTIAL PROGRESS CAN HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR SULPHUR I SUBMIT TO YOUR JUDGMENT HOW MUCH THIS CON VERTIBILITY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A FARTHER KNOWLEGE OF THE LAWS OF ELECTRICITY I AM SIR YOUR MOST HUMBLE SERVANT EDWARD DELAVAL OLD PALACEYARD MARCH 15 1759 XIV AN

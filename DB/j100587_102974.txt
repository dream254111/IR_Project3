CLAPTON IN NORTHAMPTONSHIRE OCTOBER 15 1704 A BOUT 5 OR 6 YEARS SINCE I REMOVED DIVERS ELMS MORE THAN SIX INCHES DIAMETER WHICH FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE YEARS ALL THRIVED VERY WELL BUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO THERE HAPPENING A VERY DRY TIME IN JULY OR AUGUST I OBSERVED ONE OF THOSE ELMS WHICH STOOD VERY SHALLOW AND ON PRETTY HIGH GROUND LOOKED VERY SICK THE LEAVES TURNED YELLOW AND BEGAN TO FALL OFF WHICH MADE ME WITH A KNIFE EXAMINE THE BARK I FOUND THE INSIDE THEREOF NOT SO GREEN BUT OF A MORE REDDISH COLOUR THAN THE OTHERS AND BETWEEN IT AND THE TREE NOT SO MOIST AND THE BARK STICKING VERY CLOSE TO THE WOOD BUT WHAT WAS MOST REMARKABLE I DISCERNED A GREAT MANY LITTLE BLACK FLYES OF THE BEETLE KIND VIZ HAVING A HARD CASE UNDER WHICH THEIR THIN LONG WINGS WERE CON TRACTED AND THEREWITH COVERED BETWEEN THE INFERREDBARKINFERRED AND THE TREE AND LOOKING MORE CAREFULLY I OBSERVED INFERREDTHESEINFERRED FLYES HAD MADE THEIR WAY THITHER BY PIERCING THE BARK IN INNUMERABLE PLACES EASILY DISCERNABLE ON THE OUTSIDE AND WAS ABOUT THE BIGNESS OF A LARGE PIN HOLE OR RATHER SUCH AS A LARGE PINS HEAD WOULD GO INTO SOME I FOUND H H H H H H H H H H H JUST1860 JUST ENTRING WHO HAD NOT GOT QUITE THROUGH THE BARK OTHERS HAD MADE SOME PROGRESS BETWEEN THE TREE AND THE BARK WHICH APPEARED AS A CHANNEL I DESPAIRED OF RECOVERING THE TREE HOWEVER MY SERVANTS BEING WA TERING OTHERS I CAUSED THEM TO BESTOW ABOUT TWO HOG SHEADS ON THIS TREE WITH STIRRING THE EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS AND LAYING SOME HALF ROTTEN LITTER THEREON TO DEFEND IT FROM THE SCORCHING RAYS OF THE SUN UPON THIS THE TREE IN SOME MANNER RECOVERED ITS VERDURE AGAIN THAT YEAR AND THE NEXT YEAR MADE VERY GOOD SHOOTS AND SO CONTINUED UNTIL THIS YEAR BUT THIS BEING A VERY DRY SUMMER I DISCERND DIVERS OF MY TREES IN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST TO LOOK SICK AND PARTICULARLY THE TREE FORMERLY MENTIONED I MADE THE SAME TRYAL ON THEM ALL AND FOUND THE BARK STICKING CLOSE TO THE TREE WITH BUT LITTLE MOISTURE BETWEEN AND VAST NUMBERS OF THOSE LITTLE FLYES WHO HAD PIERCED THE BARK IN MULTITUDES OF PLACES I ORDERED THE EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS TO BE LOOSENED AS FORMERLY AND ABOUT TWO HOG SHEADS OF WATER TO BE POURED ON EACH AND VIEWING THEM THE NEXT MORNING I FOUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE TREE ALMOST COVERED WITH BEES AND WALPS AND GREAT BLACK FLYES SUCH AS THEY USUALLY CALL FLESHFLYES WHO WERE ALL BUSIE IN SUCKING THE JUICE OR SAP WHICH PLENTIFULLY RUN OUT AT EVERY HOLE THAT THE LITTLE FLYES FORMERLY MENTI ONED HAD MADE IN THE BARK AND WHICH WAS VERY GLU TINOUS AND SWEET AS HONEY I AGAIN EXAMINED THE BARK AND FOUND IT VERY MOIST BETWEEN IT AND THE WOOD AND ALL THOSE LITTLE FLYES EITHER GONE OR DROWND IN THEIR NEW HABITATION BY THE SUDDEN RISE OF THE SAP THIS TREE RECOVERED UPON EXAMINATION OF SEVERAL TREES WHICH LOOKED SICKER THAN THE REST I FOUND ALMOST ALL GREENNESS HAD LEFT THE BARK AND THERE REMAINED NO MOISTURE BETWEEN IT AND THE WOOD BUT THE BARK STUCK SO CLOSE TO THE WOOD IT WAS HARDLY TO BE PARTED AND THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TREE1861 TREE THE BARK WAS PIERCED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED LITTLE FLYES WHO FROM THE HOLE AT WHICH THEY ENTRED HAD MADE EACH OF THEM A STRAIT PERPENDICULAR CHANNEL FROM THEIR ENTRANCE UPWARDS ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG OR SOMETHING MORE VERY LITTLE IF AT ALL BIGGER THAN JUST TO MOVE THEMSELVES STRAIT FORWARDS IN FOR I OBSERVED THEY ALL OF THEM IF DISTURBED CAME OUT BACKWARDS ALL ALONG ON EACH SIDE THIS CHANNEL AS CLOSE THE ONE TO THE OTHER AS THEY WELL COULD SO AS YET TO BE DISTINCT THERE WERE SMALL CHANNELS RUNNING HORIZONTALLY FROM IT IN EVERY ONE OF WHICH AT THE EXTREMITY THEREOF THERE WAS A MAGGOT IN SIZE JUST THE BIGNESS OF THE SMALL CHANNEL VERY LIVELY WHITISH AND ALMOST TRANSPARENT THESE TREES THO WELL WATERED RECEIVED NO BENEFIT THEREBY BUT DYED IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT IN THOSE TREES WHOSE LEAVES LOOKED GREEN AND HEALTHFUL THERE WAS NONE OF THESE FLYES TO BE FOUND THE REASON OF WHICH I PRESUME TO BE THAT WHILST THERE WAS A SUFFICIENT MOISTURE IN THE EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS TO SUPPLY THE TREE WITH A DUE QUANTITY OF SAP SO THIN AND DILUTED THAT IT WAS PROPER AND CAPABLE OF BEING CONVEYED INTO THE SMALLEST TWIGS AND LEAFVESSELS THE LEAVES KEPT THEIR VERDURE AND THE TREE FLOURISHED BUT WHEN BY REASON OF THE DRY SEASON THAT SUPPLY FAILED AND THE SUN PERPETUALLY EXHALING THE THINNEST AND MORE WATRY PARTS THEREOF THROUGH THE BARK THE SAP ALREADY IN THE TREE BECAME INSUFFICIENT IN QUANTITY AS WELL AS IM PROPER BY REASON OF ITS THICKNESS TO SUPPLY OR ENTER INTO ALL THOSE SMALL VESSELS THE LEAVES LOST THEIR GREENNESS AND FELL OFF AND THE SAP BECAME THICK AND VERY SWEET WHICH I HAVE FOUND IT IS NOT WHEN IT IS DULY DILUTED AND THE TREE IN GOOD HEALTH THIS INVITED THOSE FLYES TO MAKE THEIR WAY TO IT AS A PROPER NURSERY TO BRING UP THEIR YOUNG ONES WHICH I TAKE THOSE LITTLE MAGGOTS TO BE I PRESUME ALSO THAT THE EGGS WERE FIRST LAID IN THE H H H H H H H H H H H 2 GREAT1862 GREAT CHANNEL AND IT MAY BE REGULARLY PLACED AT THEIR DUE DISTANCES IN THE SIDES THEREOF AND AFTER BEING HATCH ED MADE THOSE SMALL CHANNELS THEMSELVES SINCE THOSE SMALL CHANNELS ARE NO WAY CAPABLE OF RECEIVING THE OLD FLY AND THAT THE MAGGOT IS ALWAYS FOUND AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LITTLE CHANNEL AND THE REST OF THE LITTLE CHAN NEL IS PERFECTLY FILLED WITH VERY SMALL PARTICLES WHICH WHEN DRY BECAME FINE DUST AND I CONCEIVE TO BE EITHER THE EXCREMENTS OF THE WORM OR PARTS OF THE BARK GROUND SMALL BY THE TEETH OF THE WORM TO MAKE ITS WAY FORWARDS AND REJECTED AS NOT PROPER ALIMENT OR BOTH ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER I FOUND THOSE LITTLE WHITE MAGGOTS AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR CHANNELS WHICH THEY EXACTLY FILLED WERE GROWN MUCH BIGGER AND HAD MADE THEIR PROGRESS FROM THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE FIRST INFERREDHATCHINFERRED ED WHICH WAS CLOSE TO OR UPON THE VERY WOOD OF THE TREE ALMOST TO THE VERY OUTSIDE OF THE BARK OF THE ELM WHICH IS USUALLY PRETTY THICK AND IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE PERPENDICULAR CHANNELS BEFORE MENTIONED I FOUND THE MOTHER FLY LYING DEAD FOR THE MOST PART TOWARDS THE EN TRANCE OF THE SAID CHANNEL THESE OBSERVATIONS PUT ME UPON VIEWING THE WOOD WHICH LAY IN MY YARD FOR TIMBER OR FEWEL AND IN ALL THE ELM WHICH WAS FELIED LAST SPRING I FOUND THE BARK THEREOF AS MUCH PIERCED THE SAME MOTHER CHANNEL WHICH FOR DISTINCTION SAKE I BEG LEAVE STILL THO IMPROPERLY TO CALL PERPENDICULAR FOR THESE TREES LAY ON THE GROUND AND THE SAME LITTLE NOW AS IMPROPERLY CALLED HORIZONTAL CHANNEL PROCEEDING FROM THE MOTHER CHANNELS FULL OF MAGGOTS WHICH MAGGOTS HAD ALSO MADE THEIR WAY ALMOST TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE BARK OBSERVING SOME ELM WHICH HAD LAIN MUCH LONGER IN THE YARD AND TAKING OFF THE BARK I FOUND THE SAME TRACKS BOTH OF MOTHER FLY AND MAGGOTS AND THAT AT THE EXTRE MITIES OF ALMOST ALL THE HORIZONTAL CHANNELS MADE BY THE MAG1863 INFERREDMAGGOTSINFERRED WHERE THEY INFERREDHADINFERRED SUBSISTED LONG ENOUGH TO COME TO ANY PERFECTION THE BARK WAS PIERCED QUITE THROUGH BY A NOLE JUST  OF THE CHANNEL AND NOTHING LEFT INFERREDREMAININGINFERRED BUT A SORT OF A WHITISH PRETTY TOUGH SKIN EXACTLY INFERREDTHESEINFERRED OUR AND SIZE OF THE MAGGOT AT THE MOUTH OR THE HOLE AND THE REST OF THE FORSAKEN CHANNEL PERFECTLY FILLED INFERREDWITHINFERRED WHAT I FORMERLY PERSUMD TO CALL THE EXCREMENT OF THE MAGGOT THEN I EXAMINED THE ASHWOOD WHICH HAD LAIN SOME TIME IN THE YARD AND AT FIRST SIGHT IT BEING YOUNG AND ITS BARK PRETTY SMOOTH I PERCEIVED IT FULL OF SMALL HOLES AND ON SEPARATING IT FROM THE TREE I FOUND JUST THE SAME SORT OF WORK AS IN THE ELM AND BY THE SAME SORT OF FLY HAVING FOUND SEVERAL OF THE MOTHER FLYES DEAD IN THEIR CHANNELS AND THE SAME EMPTY SKINS AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE OTHER CHANNELS ONLY WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT WHERE AS IN THE ELM ALL THE MOTHER CHANNELS WERE PERPENDICU LAR AND THE MAGGOT CHANNELS HORIZONTAL HERE IN THE ASH IT WAS JUST CONTRARY ALL THE MOTHER CHANNELS WERE HORI INFERREDZONTALINFERRED AND THE MAGGOT CHANNELS PERPENDICULAR THIS I AT FIRST THOUGHT MIGHT BE ACCIDENTAL AND PECULIAR TO THAT PIECE OF WOOD BUT ON EXAMINATION OF ABOVE 100 PIECES OF WOOD OF DIFFERENT TREES AND FELLED AT DIFFERENT TIMES I FOUND IT EXACTLY TO HOLD TRUE IN THEM ALL I OBSERVED SEVERAL OAK AND MAPLE TREES WHICH HAD BEEN FELLED SOME IN WINTER AND SOME IN SUMMER AND THE BARK REMAINING THEREON BUT COULD FIND NO SUCH THING IN EITHER OF THEM EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURES IN TAB 2

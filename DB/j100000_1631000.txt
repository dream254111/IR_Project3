indeed a serious question I doubt if the charge for medical services in the country can be much larger than 100 per head and it is thus seen that the 115000 physicians of this country must be content to divide among them a paltry income of less than 90000000 at the present time Finally the physician of the future will find his greatest service in prolonging hu man life I am not here to claim that human life is so valuable that it needs always to be prolonged This may not be so from the general economic condition of affairs but personally I think we are all more or less interested in longevity It can not be denied that there is a distinct economical gain inputting a man out of the world after he has passed his prime and before be becomes a burden upon his friends or the community The asylum and the poorhouse are not to be regarded as shining lights of advanced political econ omy but there is something in life besides mere political economy and the prolonga tion of existence is regarded as one of the chief functions both of the medical pro fession and of public charities On the other hand it must be considered that there is a distinct economical loss in cutting off from existence a man before he has run the full course of his career To train a man for usefulness requires now fully a quarter of a century and it seems only fair that he should have at least twice that time for the manifestation of his ac tivities If therefore he be cut off at thirtyfive forty or fortyfive the com munity is robbed of service to which it is entitled If old age could be secured without much of the burden now attending it there would be the gradual ripening and mellowing of NCE 849 all the functions of the body and mind If in short the human organism could be so constructed and cared for that it would continue its functional activity like the wonderful one hoss shay until the time of its final dissolution such a consumma tion is devoutly to be wished The medical profession of the future will find its best exponent in the service of senectitude An old age without illness or dementation a ripening without decay a completion of the functional activity without the breaking down of any organ are steps toward which the medical pro fession of the future may well direct its energies Death should not be regarded as a mis fortune but as an end as a termination of a journey which has been filled with delight as a rest for weariness which comes with the natural order of labor as an euthanasia and not a dreadful disaster H W WILEY U S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTRAL BRANCH OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ZOOLOGISTS THE third annual meeting of the Central Branch of the American Society of Zool ogists and the sixth annual meeting of the society since its original establishment was held at the University of Chicago March 31 and April 1 1905 The following having received the votes of the executive committees of both branches were elected to membership in the central branch James Francis Abbott Bennet M Allen Lawrence Edmunds Griffin Lynds Jones C E McClung George Wagner L M Walton Samuel L Williston Charles Zeleny The bill on vivisection before the Illinois State Legislature was discussed and it was VOTED That this society concur in the following resolution and instruct the secreN S VOL XXI No 544 tary to communicate this action to the Central Branch of the American Society of Naturalists Resolution It having come to the atten tion of the Central Branch of the American Society of Naturalists that a bill has been introduced into the Illinois State Legisla ture which would restrict the freedom of scientific investigation in Illinois Be it Resolved That the members of this society protest against such legislation as is contemplated in Senate Bill No 271 because it is inimical to the interests of science and would seriously obstruct the advance of knowledge concerning the na ture and cure of disease in man The officers elected for the ensuing year and those holding over are as follows PresidentFrank R Lillie VicePresidentWilliam A Locy SecretaryTreasurerC E McClung Additional Members of the Executive Committee C H Eigenmann for three years Herbert Osborn for two years Thomas G Lee for one year The following are titles and abstracts of papers presented at the meeting The Origin of the SexCords and Rete Cords of Chrysemys BENNET M ALLEN University of Wisconsin In an early stage of development em bryo of 7 mm total length each of the more ventral Malpighian corpuscles of the mesonephros is still attached to the peri toneum by a neck of cells which sometimes possesses a lumen and constitutes a perito neal funnel There are usually four some times three such Malpighian corpuscles in each somite A peritoneal ingrowth arises either directly from the base of each peri toneal funnel or just mediad of it These ingrowths are termed funnel sexcords Other sexcords arise from the peritoneum between the funnel sexcords and the mes entery These anastomose with the funnel sexcords which in turn unite with evagina tions from their corresponding Malpighian corpuscles after the latter have broken away from the peritoneum The bridges thus formed between the funnel sexcords and Malpighian corpuscles constitute the retecords which are thus formed from the distal portions of the funnel sexcords plus evaginations from the Malpighian corpus cles The foregoing applies to the sex gland along its entire length The distal ends of all the funnel sex cords and of many of the other sexcords contribute to the formation of the adrenal bodies The anterior portion of the sexgland of the turtle is homodynamous with the rete region of the genital ridge of the mammals pig and rabbit Further Notes on the Chromosome Com plex of Orthopteran Spermatocytes C E MCCLUNG University of Kansas A careful study of a large number of species indicates that the members of a family possess a common number of chromosomes In each species there is found a characteristic series of chromosome forms and these are in many cases pecul iarly associated In some cases the group ing is characteristic of the genus and within the genus the species are marked by variations in size of chromosomes and other parts of the cell Heterotypical mitoses occur in spermatogonia first spermatocytes and second spermatocytes and in each case witness a longitudinal division of the chromatin thread In the spermatocytes all the chromosomes do not divide in the same manner These irregularities of asso ciation and division are largely due to the action of the accessory chromosome which in some cases unite with the one tetrad forming a trivalent element and in others with two tetrads producing a pentivalent mutiple chromosome From these observa 850 SCIENCESCIENCE tions it is concluded that generic and specific characters are the result of differ ences in size and associations of chromo somes and not to variations in numbers It is also thought that continuous variation may be due to slight differences in size of the chromosomes of the germ cells while discontinuous variation would be due to alterations in the relations of chromosomes to each other Regeneration in Nudibranchs C M CHILD University of Chicago Several species of aeolids abundant in the Pacific Grove region were used for experi ment It was found that removal of a portion of the body posterior to the middle was fol lowed by rapid regeneration The larger the portion removed the more rapid the regeneration The ganglionic mass is situated posterior to the second pair of tentacles removal of the whole head anterior to the ganglia was followed by rapid and complete regenera tion When the ganglia were removed no regeneration beyond healing of the wbund occurred though the animals often lived for two weeks Regeneration of posterior portions of the body was less rapid in specimens from which the head anterior to the ganglia had been removed than in specimens with unin jured head The specimens from which the head region had been removed had lost their principal sense organs but still re tained the central nervous system intact They were much less active than specimens with normal heads and the posterior parts were consequently subjected in much less degree to the conditions accompanying functional activity of this region hence in all probability the less rapid regeneration After the new head regenerated posterior regeneration in these pieces was fully as rapid as in those with uninjured heads Removal of other portions of the body such as the lateral regions of the foot etc had no effect upon the rapidity of posterior regeneration If the animals are not fed a marked re duction in size often 50 per cent occurs in the course of two or three weeks The Relation of the Degree of Injury to the Rate of Regeneration CHARLES ZELENY Indiana University Two series of the crayfish Cambarus propinquus differing only in the degree of injury which they had sustained were com pared with regard to the rate of regenera tion of the right chela and the rate of moulting In one series AA2 the right chela was removed at its breaking joint In the other series BB2 both chelae were removed at their breaking joints and the last two pairs of walking legs were like wise removed Series AA2 comprised 36 individuals and series BB 41 individuals A comparison of the two series was made 95 days 130 days and 153 days after the operation In each case the data how very definitely that the series with the greater injury molts soonter than the one with the lesser injury and also regenerates each of its two chelae more rapidly than the latter regenerates its one removed chela Experimental Evidence Concerning the Production and the Preservation of Ac quired

S VOL XXI No 544 A definite procedure is followed in the setting and care of protozoan cultures with a medium of hay infusion The seed here used came from previous laboratory cul tures or from field collections The physio logical conditions are determined at almost daily intervals by physical and chemical methods Evidence so obtained points to fermentative action as the beginning of metabolism in the culture The curve for acidity is of much physiological signifi cance An approximate method of estima tion is used to compare the relative abun dance of the different organisms and the results are represented by curves Rela tive curves have been approximately deter mined for bacteria Colpidium Paramce cium Amoeba some Hypotricha Arcella some Rotifera and Stentor All efforts to change welldefined curves to decidedly different relative positions in the history of the culture have failed The maxima of the curves can not be interchanged by reseeding Since reseeding was not prac tised except for experiment the cysts or spores of all the organisms found must have been continually present Mutual antag onism of the different forms is not a prob able explanation The serial succession of the organisms and the parallel physico chemical changes in the environment point to specific adjustment as a probable hy pothesis The determination of some of the specific adjustments of Paramcecium and Stentor supports this hypothesis An Analysis of Physiological Conditions in a Protozoan Culture AMOS W PFTERS Zoological Laboratory University of Illinois The influence of the physiological states of protozoa in producing variations from a supposed standard is seen in the results of experiments upon both the directional and the metabolic reactions of this group To obviate this important difficulty the writer proposes to standardize the given conditions of any culture Standardiza tion of the conditions if successful uses the peculiarities of the physiological states for a more accurate interpretation of the re sults of experiment instead of leaving these states as objectionable factors in an experi mental procedure The methods to be used must conform to at least two conditions First they must not require more than a small amount of culture liquid 5 to 10 cc for a test in order that serial observations can be made upon the same culture Second they must be sufficiently accurate and sensitive to yield results that show the successive small differences which occur in the history of a single culture The special methods here applied are mostly volumetric and comprise the determination of 1 Quali tative chemical content 2 free acidity or alkalinity 3 dissolved oxygen 4 bi carbonates 5 alkali earths 6 electrical conductivity 7 oxygen consumed 8 sulphated nitrogen 9 ammoniacal nitro gen 10 individual saltsnitrites ni trates chlorides potassium calcium etc For both convenience and accuracy a sys tem of standardizing all the necessary volumetric solutions in terms of one orig inal standard acid has been devised By these methods one series of data has been taken from various media promiscuously selected for comparison and another series comes from the history of single cultures In both series the biological aspect of the media was known Comparison of the physicochemical and the biological data in dicates that variations in the former are an approximate expression for correspond ing changes in the physiological states of the organisms The methods here selected are therefore serviceable for the physio logical estimation of the protozoan environ ment 853 SCIENCESCIENCE The Evolution of Color Characters R M STRONG University of Chicago Color characters are purely relative means of distinguishing various individuals or groups of animals and their significance varies according to the experience and knowledge of the observer In birds color characters are all connected by series of transitional stages which appear perfectly continuous even after careful analysis and the most highly developed characters may be found in incipient stages not ordinarily observable A study of the colors of birds has led the writer to believe strongly in an orthogenetic theory of evolution of color characters by continuous variation in birds Some Observations on the Litoral Fauna of Pacific Grove Cal C M CHILD Uni versity of Chicago The Entomological Ecology of the Indian corn Plant S A FORBES University of Illinois This paper consists of material in pure ecology selected from the mass of matter accumulated in the course of several years study of the corn insects from the economic point of view It deals with adaptive rela tions of the corn insects to their food plant and to one another classifies adaptations of insects to their food as structural physio logical psychological local biographical and numerical giving illustrations of each class discusses the adjustment by natural selection of the life histories of insects de pendent upon the same plant analyzes ex amples of competition among such in sects refers to the agency of natural selec tion in transforming competitions from the simultaneous to the serial order and theorizes the whole subject by reference to the general principle of a community of interest between a phytophagous insect and its food plants The Fauna of Mayfields Cave ARTHUR M BANTA Indiana University Mayfields Cave is a small cave neat Bloomington Ind which presents typical cave conditions having a nearly constant temperature and conditions of light shad ing from twilight to absolute darkness Eightyseven species of animals were taken in this cave as against 68 heretofore known from all of the Indiana caves Of the 87 species but 21 are permanent residents and only 8 are found in caves exclusively Species including diptera lepidoptera 2 species arachnida and the bats hibernate in the cave in considerable numbers Each cave inhabitant sustains a certain definite relation to the light some living only in ab solute darkness others in dim twilight etc Aside from conditions of light and temper ature the distribution of cave animals is influenced by moisture the presence of organic matter whichserves as food and the presence of meansof concealment Some of the highly modified and truly cavern icolous forms are occasionally found out side of caves in springs about wells in drains and in similar situations Change of seasons has little influence upon cave life Species which are only temporary residents and some of the less highly specialized of the permanent residents are young and local cave forms while the highly specialized cave inhabitants such as the blind fish blind crayfish and the blind carabids are old and widely distributed cave forms The nearest relatives of cave forms are nocturnal or are dark or shade loving species while the food and habits of cave species are exactly similar to the food and habits of their near relatives

GUYER University of Cincinnati These hybrids five in number were pro duced by crossing a black Langshang cock with a common guinea hen When young the hybrids resembled more young guineas although the shanks were feathered as were those of the father Traces of these feath ers still nearly three years later per sist The hybrids are much larger than guineas and have louder and even more discordant voices They are extremely wild The head shows no trace of either the comb of the chicken or the helmet of the guinea but is covered with feathers clear to the beak Neither are wattles nor earlobes present The beak in color and shape resembles more that of the guinea A trace of the guineas white face is discernible in the hybrid in the immedi ate region of the eyes The neck is very long and snakelike The feathers are more or less intermediate in structure be tween those of the parent forms The tail is erect and never droops like that of the guinea The large quill feathers of tail and wing not infrequently possess vanes which are black on one side of the rachis and more like the hybrid general plumage on the other The first one to three primaries are white in all of the hybrids Guineas frequently show similar white primaries The color of the head and neck is mainly black although in two of the forms there is a decided sprinkling of white feathers in this region The general ground color of body wing and tail plum age is dark gray in three of the hybrids but in the remaining two it verges more toward a chestnut color In all the feath ers are crossed by narrow lighter colored Vshaped bars which gives the plumage on the whole a decidedly barred appearance The conspicuous white dot of the guineas plumage seems to be entirely lost There is however a secondary inconspicuous barring in many of the features of the guinea which possibly may be the source of the bars of the hybrid The forms have not proved fertile and the chief interest in them will center in the chromosomal structures of the germ cells At present there is no means of telling their sex Notes on Crossbred Chickens MICHAEL F GUYER University of Cincinnati Barred or white Plymouth Rocks and brown Leghorns were used in crossing There is much question regarding the ex act ancestry of Plymouth Rocks but un doubtedly the American Dominique and the black Java are the main sources with probably also a considerable admixture of Brahma blood The brown Leghorn of to day appears to be the descendant of an old breed of fowls introduced from Italy in 1834 The offspring 400 in number of brown Leghorn Jc X Plymouth Rock  were every one black except for an occasional feather ofreddish hue in some of the cocks While in plumage they thus seem to revert to the ancestral black Java this is not so true of shape and weight which varies in all degrees between that of the two parent types The white ear lobes of the Leghorn always persist Some of the progeny in deed resemble black Minorcas very closely Most of them have the dark slatecolored shanks that commonly accompany black fowls although about 30 per cent are yellow shanked The comb is the most variable structure exhibiting 3 or 4 to 7 serrations Not infrequently double combs two single ones side by side ap pear in the cocks Various crosses among the members of this generation and between them and the parent stocks were made but 854 SCIENCESCIENCE the limits of an abstract will not permit record of these results On the whole no characters observed appeared to follow the laws of Mendel with any accuracy For example black X black have invariably produced black offspring so far with the white ear lobes persisting A black 5 X barred plymouth  among others pro duced one male offspring which rather closely resembles a dark Brahma cock Pure white Plymouth Rocks which al ways produced white offspring when bred together never produced white offspring when crossed either way with brown Leg horns nor did any of the mongrel off spring when interbred The majority of the offspring were barred the remainder being nondescripts or occasionally black Interbreeding this generation resulted in the production of several fowls which were of a pure barred Plymouth Rock type ex cept for the persistent white ear lobes of Leghorn origin Observations on some Peculiar Habits of the Molecrickets W 3J BAUMGARTNER Kansas University The female of our northern molecricket Gryllotalpa borealis hasquite a loud and distinct chirp This seems to be used as a means of recognition in their dark burrows This observation is contradictory to the conclusion of all writers who say only male orthoptera chirp or stridulate The fe male of the Porto Rican species Scopter iscus didactylus has the same kind of a stridulating organ much smaller and weaker than that of the male on its elytra and so I conclude it also chirps Du Fours gland of excretory secre tion which later investigators have con nected with the copulatory organs is by my observations and experiments shown to be an effective protective device A strongly foetid and very sticky secretion is ejected with considerable force from the siphon 855 like genitoanal opening This must repel or retard the most ardent pursuer and so protect the soft abdomen from the rear In the act of copulation these insects assume the relative positions suited to their tunnellike homes They turn posterior end to posterior end and ventral side to ventral side the male lying on his back The sperm is transferred in a spermato phore Scopteriscus has a similar pro tective gland but its copulation was not observed The chirping of the female the protective anal secretion and the unusual position of male and female in copulation which dis tinguish the molecrickets from the rest of the orthoptera are very evidently adapta tions to life in underground tunnels The presence of the spermatophore accounts for the annexed glands in the male Gryllotalpa The Reflex Theory of Orientation as Ap plied to the Phototaxis of Ranalia S J HOLMES University of Michigan A Note on the Position of the Temporary Pharynx in the Planarian Embryo W C CURTIS University of Missouri Mattiesen in his extensive account of the embryology of the European Planaria torva which has been recently published in the Zeitschrift fir Wissenschaftliche Zoologie 04 suggests that my descrip tion of the orientation of the adult and embryonic pharyngeal structures in P maculata must have been due to the exam ination of a single abnormal specimen or to distortion caused by poor fixation My ob servation has been confirmed by Bardeen 02 and in another American form P simplicissima Stevens 04 believes the same orientation to exist although in this case the early disappearance of the primi tive or embryonic pharynx makes the mat ter difficult to establish Mattiesen finds that in P torva the adult pharynx appears JUNE 2 1905N S VOL XXI No 544 just behind the degenerating embryonic pharynx which is therefore located on the future ventral part of the body as the spherical embryo becomes flattened This confirms Ijimas 84 description of the orientation in Dendrocolum lacteum In B maculata the point at which the degen erating embryonic pharynx is last seen is on the dorsoposterior surface The Arrangement of the Mesenteries in the Cerianthidce J PLAYFAIR McMURRICH University of Michigan In 1892 Faurot observed that the mesen teries of Cerianthus membranaceus were arranged in groups of four each quartet consisting of a longer and a shorter fertile mesentery alternating with a longer and a shorter sterile one and his observation was subsequently confirmed by van Beneden for C Lloydii Both authors regarded the quartets as beginning with the fourth mesentery on each side of the midsiphon oglyphic line The study of the develop ment of the cerianthid mesenteries has shown however that the first four mesen teries on either side of the midsiphon oglyphic line constitute a group distinct from the others and are comparable to the eight protocnemes of the other groups of Anthozoa Among the Siboga actinians is a species from Amboina probably C elon gatus Kwietn In this form there is on either side of the midsiphonoglyphic line the usual short sterile directive mesentery then follow two additional sterile mesen teries and then a long fertile mesentery which extends almost to the aboral pole of the body This last is apparently the so called continuous iesentery and the inter est of it lies in the fact that it is the fourth mesentery and not the second as in all other species that have been examined This departure which occurs in all the in dividuals of the species examined corrobo rates the view based on the developmental history that the four mesenteries on either side of the midsiphonoglyphic line consti tute a group apart from the rest and that the quartets should be regarded as begin ning with the fifth mesenteries An Improved Form of Reconstruction Ap paratus THOMAS G LEE Laboratory of Histology and Embryology University of Minnesota Doctor Lee presented a very satisfactory form of reconstruction apparatus which he had designed and which is an improvement over the models now in use It consists of a castiron bed plate 8 cm 31 inches thick at sides and 4 cm 2 inches thick in the middle The top measures 23 x 30 cm 9 x 12 inches and has been accurately planed and polished giving an area of 690 sq cm 108 sq in The side pieces by which the thickness of the wax plate is de termined are moved up an inclined plane which is rigidly fastened to the bed plate in a manner similar to the movement of the object holder in a Thoma microtome All parts of the top of each side piece are thus always in the same plane The side piece is moved up and down by a large and accurately made screw at the rear of the apparatus After adjust ment the side pieces can be firmly fixed in place by two set screws by means of a small wrench A metal scale is placed on each side piece so that any thickness of wax plate can be made from 1 mm up to 1 cm at  mm intervals Thus plates of  1 1 2 2 mm etc can be made Pro jecting from the bed block are two metal strips with a depression to hold the roller when not in use This whole apparatus weighs about 67 pounds and is quite rigid The roller is of polished steel 30 cm 12 inches long by 6 cm 21 inches diameter with a steel rod projecting at each end and covered by a movable wooden handle This 856 SCIENCESCIENCE roller weighs 17 pounds but works very easily indeed The heating apparatus consists of a metal frame supporting a copper jacket which has a concavity on its upper surface just a little larger in diameter than that of the roller This protects the surface of the roller from contact with either the metal or flame This concavity could easily be changed into a hot water bath for the roller if so desired The lamp is a horizontal Bunsen burner tube with numerous small openings The roller does not require to be heated between each pair of plates and thus when not in use it is readily rolled up into the support in front of the bed plate This whole apparatus is very solid com pact accurate and easy to adjust Some Abnormalities of Growth Produced by Parasites on Alcyonaria C C NUT TING State University of Iowa In their Report on the Alcyonaria of the Challenger Expedition Wright and Studer described a new genus Calypter inus giving as a generic character a certain tunnellike structure formed by excessively enlarged spicules the tunnel being along one side of the stem or branch Later Studer in reporting on the Alcyonaria se cured by the Prince of Monacos yacht de clares that this peculiar structure is due to the presence of an annelid and is patho logical in fact A similar structure was found by the writer in a species of Tenella secured by the Albatross from Hawaiian waters The tunnellike structures with the annelids inside were shown by means of lantern slides In a new species of Dasygorgia from the same collection the writer found certain very greatly enlarged polyps which at first looked like a form of dimorphism hitherto unknown Upon dissection however these monstrous polyps were found to contain without exception minute crustaceans 857 either embryos or some form of degraded parasite These were also shown by means of lantern slides from photographs made by the author It appears that we have here a condition of affairs in an animal organism which bears a close analogy to the production of galls in vegetable tissues The Origin of the Subclavian Artery in the Chick WM A LocY Northwestern Uni versity Based on the work of Mr Sabin The subclavian artery in birds lies ven tral to the vagus nerve and vena cava in mammals it occupies a dorsal position with reference to those structures On this ac count the subclavian arteries do not appear to be homologous as to origin in these two classes of vertebrates Hochstetter was the first in 1890 to clear the question by show ing that the definitive subclavian in birds is of secondary origin Prior to its appear ance there is a vessel arising from the dorsal aorta opposite the 15th mesodermic somite which supplies blood to the wing bud from the third to the sixth day of development On the sixth day the sec ondary subclavian arises from the ventral end of the third aortic arch This new vessel passes backward and joins with the primary subclavian artery coming from the dorsal aorta and from the sixth to the close of the seventh day of development the wing bud receives blood from the two sources The primary subclavian then dis appears and the secondary subclavian re mains as the permanent one Mr C G Sabin a graduate student in Northwestern University has traced with great care the embryonic history of the subclavians in the bird and has illustrated the same His results agree closely with those of Hochstetter except that he finds the primary subclavian in earlier stages than Hochstetter and observes that in the early condition the subclavian arises inde JUNE 2 1905858 SCIENCE pendently of the segmental arteries with which however they join later The illus trations which Mr Sabin gives of the actual condition of the developing subelavian ar teries were very much to be desired since Hochstetters paper was illustrated only by a few simple diagrams The results are now published in the Anatomischer An zeiger Vol 26 Nos 11 and 12 with 29 illustrations The following demonstrations were made before the society 1 William A Locy Northwestern Uni versity Dissections

j100000,Science,1645608,The Biographical Directory of American Men of Science,i296685,THE BIOGRAPHICAL DIRECTORY OF AMERICAN MEN OF SCIENCE THE third edition of the Biographical Directory is now in type it will be published as soon as the printers can complete their part of the work The editor ventures to ask for the return of all proofs and also for informa tion in case proof has not been received A second copy of the proof by letter post and with return letter postage has been sent to those who did not return the first copy within a reasonable time If it is not known that a scientific man can be reached at the address given or even that he is living it will in most cases be undesirable to include the biograph ical sketch It is gratifying that the number of those engaged in scientific work in America has in creased from about 4000 in 1905 to about 10000 at the present time This circum stance however has greatly enhanced the labor and the cost involved in the preparation of the work and it is not possible to write individual letters of enquiry in all cases where this might be desirable The editor conse quently makes public this request for the return of the corrected proofs of all biograph ical sketches J MCKEEN CATTELL GARRISONONHUDSON N Y QUOTATIONS

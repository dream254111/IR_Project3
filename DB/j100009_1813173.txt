American colonies New Haven Yale Univ Press 1919 3 This careful study of the aristocratic feudal features of our co lonial land system illustrates anew the truth that here in America as elsewhere free institutions are the result of gradual evolution The book shows that instead of land being free in this country from the first as is often loosely asserted the fact is that nowhere in the British colonies outside of Massachusetts Rhode Island and Con necticut was there an acre of land that was not held of a lord802 Reviews and New Books December either the king or one or more proprietors even in the Puritan colonies feudal obligations had a place in certain individual cases and in the relations to the crown and quitrents were demanded down to the eve of the Revolution Professor Charles M Andrews in a brief introduction to the volumne suggests that the prospect of revenues from quitrents explains the zeal of various British nobles for a century and a half to acquire landed estates in the American wilderness These dues had a deterrent effect on land speculation and in some instances particularly in Maryland on settlement Professor Bond also throws fresh light on the origins of the Revo lution by showing that irritation over the quitrents was another one of the causes of discontent that led to the revolt These feudal charges represented an outside control that was blocking progress In Professor Andrews words the quitrent in the domain of real property like the royal prerogative in the field of government and the navigation acts in the field of commerce was an obstacle to com plete colonial independence Had the crown succeeded in obtain ing an independent income from quitrents imperial control would have been so strengthened as to have made a revolt difficult if not impossible p 445 Opposition to the quitrents was not due to the amount of the payment except where large arrears had accumulated p 455 it was because of hostility to the principle of such a charge or dis content over the measures of enforcement The difficulty of secur ing an acceptable medium of exchange during the colonial period is well brought out in the account of controversies over payment A well organized bibliography at the end contains a list of manu scripts and other unprinted material bearing on the subject with the places where they may be found AMELIA C FORD BURTON T E Modern

in the United States makes up this volume There is presented a com prehensive survey of the political social and economic problems of the readjustment period The several problems are discussed under the following heads I Ideals of Democracy II Institutions of Democracy III AfterWar Social Problems IV AfterWar Labor Problems V AfterWar Transportation Problems VI AfterWar Political Problems Under the appropriate divisions are treated such subjects as democracy and private property child welfare so1919 Economic History and Geography 803 cial insurance industrial relations unemployment transportation and commerce public health and political readjustment More than a score of authorities have contributed to the discussion Readjustments occasioned by the war are sketched in many of the articles In this respect the authors have duplicated informa tion already presented in other works on reconstruction but there is ample justification in the intimate relation that exists between war conditions and the problems of reconstruction Moreover the major part of the volume is devoted to reconstruction The whole discus sion is prefaced with a suggestive historical survey of political so cial and economic developments in the United States The book is open to criticism at some points In discussing the suggestion for a general distribution of wealth among the masses the contributor states If such a plan offered any hope in solving this problem it wiould have been adopted centuries ago and The division of wealth or rise in salaries will not make us richer or happier p 257 The assumption here seems to be that any scheme of social reform that has not already been tried offers no relief The author fails to recognize that first in early organiza tions of human society such a general distribution of wealth existed and second that the dynamic forces of social evolution often in troduce changes hitherto unknown If the division of wealth or rise in salaries will not make humanity richer or happier it is difficult to understand the psychology that underlies present social unrest or to comprehend the necessity of thrift which the author declares to be the lever of social progress The space devoted to the discussion of afterwar labor problems seems to be too brief Long before hostilities ceased it was generally conceded that the labor probleill would constitute the most serious question of the reconstruction period and subsequent developments have substantiated this opinion GORDON S WATKINS ESAREY L A history of Indiana Vol I From its exploration to 1850 Vol

Labor and reconstruction in Europe New York Dutton 1919 Pp xv 216 250 It is the purpose of this volume to outline the labor situation in Europe with a view to promoting in this country a clearer concep tion of the struggle for justice equality of opportunity and social responsibility that is going on in the Old World No definite policy and no scheme of reform is advocated and in the interest of pre serving the original point of view the author quotes directly and at length from primary sources The labor problem is recognized as the most serious one that will command the attention of the new generation Fully one half of the volume is devoted to a presentation of the reconstruction programs that have been advanced by different in terest groups in England especially those found in the reports of such bodies as the Whitley Committee the Garton Foundation the Minister of Labor and the British Labor Party Generous treat ment is accorded also the reform rrieasures proposed by workmens organizations and other interests in Germany Two of the four chapters deal exclusively with the structure and functions of re construction commissions and the general problems of the post bellum period The major thought here is that the reconstruction problem is fundamentally one of making good the wastes occasioned by the war To this end production must be increased and con sumption curtailed The volume is for the most part a compilation and reprint of for eign programs for reconstruction and is in no sense an original an alysis of the contemporary labor situation in Europe Persons who have read these reports in the official organs of foreign governments or in the publications of the United States Department of Labor and the Department of Commerce will find little additional informa tion in this book For those who have not had access to these documents this work will prove of value GORDON S WATKINS GILBERT C G and POGUE J E The energy resources of the United

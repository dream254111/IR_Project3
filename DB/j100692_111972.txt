j100692,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London,111972,On Internal and External Division in the Calculus of Symbols Abstract,i207053,II On Internal and External Division in the Calculus of Symbols By WILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE Esq MA FRS Received January 8 1862 Abstract Continiuing my researches in the calculus of symbols I have been led to investigate the most general case of division viz that wherein a function of any degree n in X is divided 1 internally 2 ex ternallvy by another function of any otber degree m in r The investigations here subjoined give 1 the various terms of the quo tient together with their laws of derivation both by actual division and otherwise 2 the final remainder and thence the conditions that the divisor may be a factor internal or external as the case may be of the dividend An example has been added in each case by way of illustrating the processes A remarkable reciprocal relation subsisting between the functions D of the coefficients 0 of the dividend and the corresponding functions T of the coefficients 4 of the divisor is exhibited at the end of the paper558 I have confined myself throughout to that branch of the calculus wherein the functions treated of are arranged according to powers of r that wherein they are arranged according to powers of P has been already more fully discussed by Mr Russell

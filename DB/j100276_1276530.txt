by adherence to an artificial form of action which often operates to prevent the enforcement of a morally just demand BANKRUPTCYPAYMtNT TO BANK or PREEXISTING DEBT NOT A PREfER ENcEThe bankrupt had borrowed 200000 from defendant bank giving notes therefor when the notes were due a loan was effected elsewhere for 300000 which amount was deposited in the defendant bank to the credit of the bankrupt A check to the order of the defendant bank for the amount of the debt with interest was then drawn against this deposit Bankruptcy ensuing within four months the trustee sues to recover the amount so paid on the ground that the payment operated as a preference Held that such payment did not amount to a preference and the bank was permitted to retain the moneyWalsh v First Nat Bank of Maysville 6th C C A I913 29 Am B R 18 In the absence of collusion and fraud a bank oif deposit has always been permitted to setoff debts owing it and due from a bankrupt against any deposits it may have of the bankrupt In N Y County Bank v Massey 192 U S 138 such a right was declared to exist the court saying relative to the nature of a bank deposit It is not a transfer of property as a payment mortgage gift or security It is true it creates a debtbut it does not enlarge the scope of the statute defining preferences so as to prevent setoff recog nized within the terms of  68a In that case the debts of the bankrupt were due and the entire deposit was set off against the claim of the creditor The same situation existed in Irish v Citizens Trust Co I63 Fed 880 in which deposits were allowed to be set off against matured claims of a creditor bank but not allowed in case of claims unmatured In Lowell v International Trust Co I58 Fed 78I deposits were allowed to be set off against demand loans payable to the creditor bank In re Geo M Hill  Co I30 Fed 315 allowed setoff of so much of the claims of the creditor bank as equaled the amount of the bankrupts deposit but would not allow it against notes given by the bankrupt to third parties and negotiated to the bank In re Little IIo Fed 62I which preceded Bank v Massey supra announced the same rule as was later sustained in that case The principal case does not announce any new doctrine but it does present in a slightly varying manner the circum stances under which may arise the always interesting question of a bank receiving what is in effect a preference though declared by the courts not to be In the principal case the setoff completely extinguished the claim of the creditor bank leaving it nothing to prove in the bankruptcy proceedings while the other reported cases involve situations in which the amount of the creditors claim has exceeded the bankrupts deposit The principle is the same in each instance however and the decision not only follows the rule of the adjudicated cases but is in conformity with the law BILLS AND NoTEsDELIVERYCONDITIONSDefendant delivered his non negotiable promissory note to

IaI The cases are in conflict upon this point The following authorities hold that a note may be delivered to the party in whose favor it is drawn upon a condition so that until performance of the

said Such a contract cannot become a binding obligation until it has been delivered Its delivery may be absolute or conditional If the latter then it does not become a binding obligation until the condition upon which its delivery depends has been ful filled To the contrary are the following cases Neely v Lewis Io Ill 31 Roche v Roanoke Seminary 56 Ind 198 Massman v Holscher 49 Mo 87 In Madison etc Plank Road Co v Stevens Io Ind I the court said that parol evidence cannot be given to vary the legal effect of such delivery or the terms of the instrument delivered The authorities are uniform in hold ing that a bill or note as well as a deed may be delivered as an escrow to a third party I DANIEL NEG INST 5 Ed 68 BILLS AND NOTESNO INTEREST ON NOTI PAYABLE ONE DAY AFTER DATE WITHOUT INTERESTIn an action on a promissory note made payable one day after date    without interest the plaintiff contended that interest should begin to run from the date of maturity Held the note will begin to bear interest only from the time payment is demanded or suit is brought thereon Pierpoint v Pierpoint W Va I912 76 S E 848 The courts conclusion is opposed to the well established principle that where there is a contract to pay money on a day certain whether such con tract be express or implied and the money is not paid when due interest is recoverable on the amount in default from the day when it should have been paid Cheek v Waldrumn 25 Ala I52 Gould v Oneonta 7I N Y 298 Foote v Blanchard 6 Allen 22I The court lays considerable stress on the fact that the note matured one day after date and concludes therefrom that the parties could not reasonably have had in mind the interest for one day But such conclusion rests neither upon authority nor sound reasoning on the contrary there is respectable authority opposed thereto In the following cases it was held that interest should begin to run from the day of maturity even though the note was payable only one day after date Powell v Guy 20 N C 70 Carter v King II Rich IS C 125 See also Foster v Harris IO Pa St 457 In the principal case ithe court said that a note payable one day after date is for all practical purposes a note payable on demand Con sequently it applies the rule applicable to demand notes that interest runs only from the time when a demand is made Gould v Emerson I6o Mass 438 Sanborn v U S 135 U S 271 But there are many practical distinc tions between paper payable on demand and paper payable one day after date Paper payable on demand is due forthwith and suit may be brought 400

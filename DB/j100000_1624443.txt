WASHINGTON THE regular meeting was held on April 14th The first paper of the evening was read by Dr Hillebrand and was entitled The Volu metric Estimation of Vanadium in the Presence of small Amounts of Chromium with especial Reference to the Analysis of Rocks and Ores When chromium has been estimated colorimet rically as detailed in a previous paper the vanadium can in many instances be estimated without separation from the chromium by the wellknown method of titration with KMnO4 With considerable chromium present the error is increased by the difficulty of getting sharp end reaction due to the color of the chromic salt and to the oxidizability of Cr203 in hot solutions but the author shows how to ascertain and apply a proper correction within certain limits The method is especially applicable to rocks iron ores clays coals etc in which chromium is seldom an important constituent quantita tivelySCIENCE Tables of numerous test trials on prepared solutions containing from one to 875 mg Cr2O3 and from one to 47 mg V205 showed errors with two exceptions of much less than i mg and establish the method as trustworthy in competent hands A further table showed the applicability of the method to ores and rocks to which known amounts of Cr203 and V205 had been added These were fused together with sodium carbon ate and nitrate the silica and alumina were re moved from the alkaline extract phosphorus chromium and vanadium were thrown down by Hg2NO2 the mixed precipitate was ignited the residue refused with a little sodium carbon ate and in the resulting aqueous extract both chromium and vanadium were estimated the results being equally as good as those obtained with simple solutions The author suggested that the reaction of H2 02 on Cr203 and V205 in the presence of ether might be utilized to remove the greater part of the chromium prior to titration of the vanadium since the oxidation product 6f chromic acid dis solves in the ether while that of vanadic acid does not also that the brown color produced in vanadic solutions by H202 might be made the basis of an exact colorimetric method for the estimation of vanadium The next paper was presented by Dr de Schweinitz and Mr Marion Dorset and was entitled  The Mineral Constituents of the Tubercle Bacilli The authors in continuation of their work upon the study of the tubercle bacilli made a careful analysis of the ash and found a very large percentage of phosphates calcium magnesium potassium and sodium They pointed out the apparent close connection between the high content of fat and phosphates in the body of the germ and the method of treating tuberculous patients with codliver oil and phosphates The work is being continued now in the direction of a careful study of the albuminoids of the germ Mr Fireman presented a paper on Some Observations on the Centric Benzene Formula and the Aromatic Character The centric formula is ascribed to the unreduced ring while to the partially reduced ring a structure with the double bonds in the ordinary sense is at 783 tributed The transformation of the unreduced into the reduced ring and vice versa as well as the transformation of the ring with the centric structure into the ring with the double bonds and vice versa must be recognized as a char acteristic feature of benzene and its derivatives the aromatic compounds If this is so then the centric formula is inapplicable to a ring of either 5 7 or any odd number of carbon atoms reduction of such rings being impossible since the valencies could not be satisfied in case of reduction Hence the rings of 5 and 7 carbon atoms nearest to benzene in the number of members of the nucleus can not be expected to be endowed with an aromatic character On the other hand assuming as we must that the tension in the benzene ring due to the closing of the latter is small then a ring of 4 or 8 car bon atoms would similarly have too much tension which would be incompatible with such a degree of stability as we find in aromatic compounds It follows therefore that from the standpoint of the centric formula and of ring tension only the benzene ring can be expected to be a carrier of the aromatic character which is in entire agreement with the facts The last paper of the evening was presented by Dr Stokes and was entitled The Meta phosphimic Acids The paper outlined an at tempt to explain some of the properties of the metaphosphimic acids by means of von Baeyers tension theory These acids have the general formula PNO2H22 and may be regarded as ring compounds Regarding the rings as poly gons the acids actually studied are as follows the angle between adjacent sides of the poly gon and its difference from 135 the angle in volving the least tension being given Angle be

preceding member and represents a maximum stability with a presumable minimum of tension P5N500oHo is less stable than P4N4O8H8 but more stable than P3N30SH6 while JUxE 3 1898N S VOL VII No 179 the tension in the ring of P7N704H4 is too great to permit of its existence and it spontaneously takes up water forming P7N705H6 A further confirmation is found in the fact that the higher members on decomposition in part close again to form the stable ringacid P4N408H8 indica ting a disposition to form rings containing P4N4 An attempt to test this theory further will be made by endeavoring to prepare diphosphoni trilic chlorid P2N2C14 The corresponding metaphosphimic acid P2N204H4 should have the angle 90 differing from the angle of least tension 135 by 45 Such an acid should be much less stable than even P7N704H14 and should pass at once into P2N20H6 WILLIAM H KRUG Secretary ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADEL PHIA MAY 17 MR C S BOYER illustrated the structure and geographical distribution of diatoms by a large series of lantern views preparatory to describ ing the following new species Rhabdonema Wool manianum Biddulphia semicircularis Asburyana B argus B interrupta B keeleyi B Shulzei and B verrucosa The paper with figures will be published in the Proceedings of the Academy MR T C PALMER described and illustrated some of the phenomena of conjugation in Clos terium The essential steps are essentially as in Spirogyra in that in both cases the process is at first a putting out of tubes which meet and fuse But just as Closterium differs from Spiro gyra in its method of celldivision so it presents peculiarities in manner of formation of the zygospore The two lobes of the desmid seem to possess a certain degree of individuality at least at the period of conjugation These lobes owing to the peculiar method of growth of the plant generally differ at the time of conjuga tion in age and therefore in size and in the thickness color and markings of the cellwalls The contrast between two ends or lobes of a given cell is often very great and in C acero sum as a rule each desmid first separates into two entirely distinct and independent semicells each of which is beautifully rounded off at its blunt end by a new growth of cellwall The young semicell of each desmid then conjugates with the old semicell of the other and two perfectly distinct zygospores are thus formed These zygospores and the empty semicell cases are held together by a nearly or quite invisible jelly The individuality of the semicell a tendency toward which has been remarked upon heretofore by Mr Archer in the case of C lineatum here becomes practically complete In one instance C acerosum formed three zygospores instead of two One of these was the usual size made up of the commingled con tents of an old and new semicell The other two were about half the size and consisted each of the unmixed contents of another semicell Of a similar nature is the recently observed discharge without conjugation of the contents of a whole cell in C lineatum The protoplasm containing small round or ovoid bodies like those in the ordinary zygospore issued from the ruptured union of the semicell cases It assumed a spherical form Its development could not be followed further The development of the zygospores of Clos terium is not thoroughly well understood but the phenomena are probably similar to those of the germination of Cosmarium In addition however to this process another method of reproduction is suspected in Closterium of which the discharge of the cellcontents without con jugation may be one of the stages Many of the phases of reproduction in the desmids may be observed to advantage by plac ing zygospores in lifeslides and following the changes that ensue In such slides large numbers of very minute Closterium frequently appear and these grow perceptibly from day to day but it is not certain or even probable that these arise from the ordinary zygospore The following papers were presented for pub lication in the Proceedings Descriptions of five new Phyllostome Bats by Gerrit S Miller Jr Chitons collected by Dr Harold Heath at Pacific Grove

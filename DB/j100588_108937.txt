ESQ FR S RECEIVED OCTOBER 24READ DECEMBER 7 1865 M HERMITE IN A PAPER 1 SUR LA THEORIE DE LA TRANSFORMATION DES FONCTIONS ABELIENNES COMPTES RENDUS T XL 1855 PP 249 C ESTABLISHES INCIDENTALLY THE PROPERTIES OF THE MATRIX FOR THE AUTOMORPHIC LINEAR TRANSFORMATION OF THE BIPARTITE QUADRIC FUNCTION XW YZZYWX OR TRANSFORMATION OF THIS FUNCTION INTO ONE OF THE LIKE FORM XWYZZYWX THESE PROPERTIES ARE AS WILL BE SHOWN DEDUCIBLE FROM A GENERAL FORMULA IN MY  MEMOIR ON THE AUTOMORPHIC LINEAR TRANSFORMATION OF A BIPAR TITE QUADRIC FUNCTION PHIL TRANS VOL EXLVIII 1858 PP 3946 BUT THE PARTICULAR CASE IN QUESTION IS AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING ONE THE THEORY WHEREOF IS WORTHY OF AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION FOR CONVENIENCE THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES IS TAKEN TO BE FOUR BUT IT WILL BE AT ONCE SEEN THAT AS WELL THE DEMONSTRATIONS AS THE RESULTS ARE IN FACT APPLICABLE TO ANY EVEN NUMBER WHATEVER OF VARIABLES ARTICLE NOS 1  2NOTATION AND REMARKS 1 I USE THROUGHOUT THE NOTATION AND FORMULE CONTAINED IN MY I MEMOIR ON THE THEORY OF MATRICES PHIL TRANS VOL CXLVIII 1858 PP 1737 AND IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED MEMOIR ON THE AUTOMORPHIC TRANSFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPOSITION OF MATRICES THE RULE OF COMPOSITION IS AS FOLLOWS VIZ ANY LINE OF THE COMPOUND MATRIX IS OBTAINED BY COMBINING THE CORRESPONDING LINE OF THE FIRST OR FURTHER COMPONENT MATRIX WITH THE SEVERAL COLUMNS OF THE SECOND OR NEARER COMPONENT MATRIX IT ISVERY CONVENIENT TO INDICATE THIS BY THE ALGORITHM A B C LG  Y A C  11 A B6 C J  3A  I A BT C ALL BL AT IT YALL  VL EU   WHICH EXHIBITS VERY CLEARLY THE TERMS WHICH ARE TO BE COMBINED TOGETHER THUS IN THE UPPER LEFTHAND CORNER WE HAVE A 6 CA A A AND SO FOR THE OTHER PLACES IN THE COMPOUND MATRIX 2 IT IS NOT IN THE MEMOIR ON MATRICES EXPLICITLY REMARKED BUT IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT SUMS OF MATRICES ALL THE MATRICES BEING OF THE SAME ORDER MAY BE MULTIPLIED TOGETHER BY THE ORDINARY RULE THUS ABCDACADBCBD THIS REMARLK WILL BE USEFUL IN THE SEQUEL MDCCCLXIE26 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE THEORY OF MATRICES ARTICLE NOS 3 TO 13FIRST INVESTIGATION 3 WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THE FORMULAE FOR THE AUTOMORPHIC LINEAR TRANSFORMATION OF THE FUNCTION XWYZZYWX THAT IS OF THE

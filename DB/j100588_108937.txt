Esq FR S Received October 24Read December 7 1865 M HERMITE in a paper 1 Sur la theorie de la transformation des fonctions Abeliennes Comptes Rendus t xl 1855 pp 249 c establishes incidentally the properties of the matrix for the automorphic linear transformation of the bipartite quadric function Xw yzzywx or transformation of this function into one of the like form XWYZZYWX These properties are as will be shown deducible from a general formula in my  Memoir on the Automorphic Linear Transformation of a Bipar tite Quadric Function Phil Trans vol exlviii 1858 pp 3946 but the particular case in question is an extremely interesting one the theory whereof is worthy of an independent investigation For convenience the number of variables is taken to be four but it will be at once seen that as well the demonstrations as the results are in fact applicable to any even number whatever of variables Article Nos 1  2Notation and Remarks 1 I use throughout the notation and formule contained in my I Memoir on the Theory of Matrices Phil Trans vol cxlviii 1858 pp 1737 and in the abovementioned memoir on the Automorphic Transformation With respect to the composition of matrices the rule of composition is as follows viz any line of the compound matrix is obtained by combining the corresponding line of the first or further component matrix with the several columns of the second or nearer component matrix it isvery convenient to indicate this by the algorithm a b c lg  y a c  11 a b6 c j  3a  I a bt c all bl at it yall  Vl eu   which exhibits very clearly the terms which are to be combined together thus in the upper lefthand corner we have a 6 ca a a and so for the other places in the compound matrix 2 It is not in the Memoir on Matrices explicitly remarked but it is easy to see that sums of matrices all the matrices being of the same order may be multiplied together by the ordinary rule thus ABCDACADBCBD this remarlk will be useful in the sequel MDcccLxIE26 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE THEORY OF MATRICES Article Nos 3 to 13First Investigation 3 We have to consider the formulae for the automorphic linear transformation of the function xwyzzywx that is of the function 1  1   1    2Qx y Z xwq y z w viz if the variables are transformed by the formula X Z orIKX  Y3 Z W I x Z  j1Yt V  ZWI then the matrix LI is such that we have identically PIXx Y Z qu4 Ly Z qvf  KXI YJ Z W3X Y1ZW the expression for LI is given in my memoir above referred to viz observing that the matrix 2 is skew symmetrical then No 13 we have where T is an arbitrary symmetrical matrix 4 I propose to compare with the matrix II the inverse matrix HI Recollecting that in the theory of matrices ABCD1DC1B1A we have Ill Q21P0yXQ0 y l0 and it is to be shown that II and II1 are composed of terms which except as to their signs are the same in each so that either of these matrices is derivable from the other by a peculiar form of transposition It is to be borne in mind throughout that T is symmetrical Q skew symmetrical 5 I write for greater convenience  l 21QT 2T 22 and I compare in the first instance the matrices T 9T2 and T2XT 2 6 Any matrix whatever and therefore the matrix T  Q1 may be exhibited as the sum of a symmetrical matrix and a skew symmetrical matrix that is we may write T2 T2 where T is symmetrical 2 is skew symmetrical We have thenPROFESSOR CAYLEY ON THE THEORY OF

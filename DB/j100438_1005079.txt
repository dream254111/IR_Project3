BODIE3 IN GENERAL ENLARGE THLCIR DIMEN JIONS OR EXPAND ON BEING HEATED AND CONTRA IN COOLING FROM FOMIE EXPERIMENTS HERETOFORE MADE WOOD HAS BEEN TLHOUGHT TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE AND THIS OPINION HAS FO FAR PREVAILED THAT MANY CURIOUS PER FONS HAVE APPLIED WOODEN PENDULUM RODS TO THEIR TIME PIECES TO PREVENT THE VARIATION IN THEIR RATE OF GOING ARIFING FROM THE EXPANFIOTN AND CONTRADTINGY OF A METAL ROD FROM MY OWN OBFERVATIONS HOWEVER A SN WELL AS THOFE OF FOME OF MY FRIENDS THE WOODEN PENDULUM ROD DOES NOT APPEAR TO ANFWVER THE EXPEDATIONS FORMNED ON IT I HAD IN MY POFFEFFION FOR FEVERAL YEARS AN EXCELLENT TIME PIECE MADE FOR THIS FOCIETY BY AN INGENIOUS WORKIRNAN AND WORTHY MEMBER OF THE FOCIETY THE REFULT OF MY CONFTANT ATTENTION TO THIS CLOCK WAS THAT THOUGH ITS RE GULAR VARIATIONS WITH HEAT AND COLD WVERE PROBABLY MUCH LEFS THAN THOFE OF METAL PENDULUMS IT NEVERTHELEFS ALWAYS WENT FAFTER IN WINTER THAN IN FUMMER AND WAS LIABLE TO VERY FUDDEN AND CONFIDERABLE VARIATIONS ARIFING NO DOUBT FROM THE COMBINED EFFECDS OF HEAT AND COLD MOIF TURE AND DRYNEFS THIS DETERMINED ME TO MAKE FOME CAREFUL EXPERIMENTS WITH A PYROMETER CAPABLE OF RECEIVING A PIECE OF WOOD OF THE LENGTH OF A FECOND PENDTULUM SEVERAL YEARS AGO I MADE FOME EXPERIMENTS OF THIS KIND PERFEDLY CORREFPONDING WITH THOFE I HAVE LATELY MADE AND WHICH I NOW COMMUNICATE TO THE FOCICTY E I TOOK30 EXPANSION OF WOOD BY IIEAT I TOOK A FTRAIGHT GRAINED PIECE OF WHITE HICCORY GREEN FOR I COULD NOT PROCURE ANY FEAFONED ITS LENGTH 39 INCHES AND ABOUT 3 OF AN INCH FQTTARE THIS I PLACED IN MNY PYROMETER AND KEPT IT FULLY EXTENDED BY A WEIGHT FAFLENED TO A FIRING GOING OVER A PULLEY TO THE PYRO METER I APPLIED THE TUBE AND GLAFFES OF A GOOD COMPOUND MICROFCOPE AND A MICROMETER THE VALUE OF THE FNMALLER DIVIFILONS WHEREOF I FOUND TO BE NEARLY 00053 PARTS OF AN INCH EACH THE ROD OF WOOD BEING PLACED IN THE PYROMETER I POURED FAND ALL AROUND IT HEATED TO ABOUT 250 OF FAHREN HEIT WHICH DEGREE OF HEAT I FOUND THE WOOD WOULD BEAR WITHOUT ICORCHING ON POURITNG IN THE HOT FAND THE ROD EXPANDED VERY MURCH BUT FOON BEGAN TO CONTRAD EVEN BEFORE THE FAND WAS FENFIBLY COOLED WHICH I FUIPPOFE AROFE FROM THE HOT FAND EXTRADING THE MOIFLURE OF THE WOOD IT CONTINUED TO CONTRAD AS THE WHOLE GREW COOL FO THAT WHEN THE ROD HAD ACQUIRED ITS FIRFT TEMPERATURE IT WAS NEAR 30 OF THE ABOVE DIVIFIONS FHORTER THAN AT FIRFI I REPEATED THE OPERATION A FECOND AND THIRD TIME AND HAD THEN REAFON TO CONCLUDE THAT THE WOOD WAS NEARLY AS DRY AS IT WOULD BECOME BY LYING LONG IN A DRY AIR I NOW LET IT COOL TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ATMOFPHERE WHICH WAS 750 AND HEATING THE FAND TO ZOO ONLY I POURED IT AROUND THE ROD IN A FEW MINUTES IT EXPANDED I 6 DIVI FIONS IN HALF AN HOUR THE FAND HAD COOLED TO I25 AND TLLE ROD HAD CONTRADED I I DIVIFIONS IN AN HOUR MORE THE FAND WAS 8O AND THE ROD HORTENED FULL 4 DIVIFIONS MORE BEING NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS LENGTH WHEN THE FAND WAS FIRFT APPLIED ON THE WHOLE I CONCLUDE THAT VERY DRY WOOD EXPANDS WITH LHEAT PRETTY REGULARLY THOUGH CERTAINLY IN A MUCH LEFS DEGREE THAN ANY OF THE METALS OR EVENI GLAFS DAVID RITTENHOUSE TO THE PHILOJFOPHICAL SOCIETY P SEXPANSIO0N OF WOOD TY HEAT 3 MAY I TH 1796 P S THE ROD ABOVE MENTIONED HAVING BECN KEPT IN A DRY PLACE FOR TWELVE MIIONTHS I AGAIN TRIED IT WITH THE PYROMNETER HAVING FIXED NEAR ONE END OF IT A FMAILL GRA DUATEDL FCALE OF IVORY 360 DIVIFIONS WHEREOF WERE EQULAL TO ONE INCH RHIS FCALE WAS VIEWED WITH THE MICROF COPE FURNIFHED WITH A CROIFS HAIR AND I THIOUGHIT THIS METHOD PREFERABLE TO THE FCREW MICROMETER LIFED BEFORE THE ROD WAS PLACED IN THE PYROMETER WHEN THE TEM PERATURE OF THE AIR WAS ABOUT 60O ON POURING FANDI AROUND IT HEATED A LITTLE HIGHER THAN BOILING WATER PER HAPS IT IMMEDIATELY EXPANDED 2 A DIVIFION BUT IN LEFS THAN A MINLUTE IT BEGAN TO CONTRA AND CONTINUED TO DO FO FOR AN HOUR WHEN I DREW OFF THE FAND IT WAS NOW FULL TO DIVIFIONS FLORTER THAN AT FIRF FO THAT IT HAD IINM BIBED A GREAT DEAL OF RNOIFLURE FROM THE AIR WHICH IT AGAINL PARTED WITH TO THE HEATED IAND THREE HOURS AFTERWARDS WHEN THE ROD WAS COOL I AGAIN POURED THE FAND ON IT HEATED AS BEFORE IT NOW CONTINUED TO EXPAND FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES RWHEN ITS LENGTH WAS ENCREAFED 3 DIVI FIONS IT THEN BEGAN TO CONTRAA AND BECAME FULL 3 DIVI FIONS FHIORTER THAN WHEN THE FAND WAS POURED ON IT I CAUFED THE FAND TO RNTN OFF ORNCE MORE AND LET THE ROD COOL TZHEN HEATING THE FAND 25SO BY A THERMOMETER I POURED IT ON THE ROD AND IN A FEW MNINUTES IT EXPANDED 34 DIVIFIONS IT THEN BEGAN TO CONTRAA ILOWLY AND IN 15 MINUITES IT BECAME 4 OF A DIVFION FLHORTER THAN AT FIRIT ON THE WHIOLE L CONCLUDED THAT THE EXPANFION OF WOOD IN ITS LENGTH WILL BE IRRREGULAR5 CORREFPONDING PARTLY TO THE WARMTH AND PARTLY TO THE MOIFTURE OF THE ATMOLPHERE D RITTENHOUSE E 2 A LETTER

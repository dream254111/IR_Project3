or Tones in the antient Graecian Music by Sir Francis Haskins Eyles Stiles Bart F R S NOtwithstanding the valuable edi tions of the antient musical and harmonic writers given by Meibomius and Wallis and the great pains those two learned editors have bestowed on the correcting the tables and throwing light on the difficult passages of those works there are some of the doctrines delivered in them that seem still to require a more perfect ex planation Those that respect the tones or modes in particular seem to have been ill understood and as it was on these that the effects of the antient music were supposed principally to depend I have thought that the subject might well merit a re examination Read Decem ber 1759 and January c 1760 Concerning these modes we find two distinct and seemingly contradictory doctrines delivered by the antients and this it is which has perplexed the sub ject696 ject for some not aware of the distinction have charged the antients with contradictions and others who perceived the two doctrines not being able to reconcile them have either adopted one and rejected the other or given up the subject as hopeless but as they were both admitted by the antients they must both have been true in some sense What therefore I have principally in view in these sheets is to shew that the difference between the doctrines arose only from the different way of considering one and the same object and that therefore there was such an agreement betwixt them as that under certain re strictions they may be embraced under one common interpretation For distinction sake I shall call one of these doc trines the harmonic and the other the musical doc trine the reason of which will sufficiently appear when I come to treat of the distinction between the science of harmonic and that of melopaeia or musical composition According to the harmonic doctrine the number of the modes had been augmented to fifteen but as Ptolemey who appears to have favoured the musical reduces them to seven and as it is on the principles of that writer that I propose to shew an agreement between the doctrines it will be necessary for me in treating of the harmonic modes to distinguish the seven he admits from the eight he has excluded This being premised I shall be understood in making the distribution of what I have to offer upon this subject which I propose to treat under the fol lowing six heads First697 First To explain the harmonic doctrine as far as concerns the seven modes admitted by Pto lemey Secondly To explain the musical doctrine of the same modes and shew its agreement with the harmonic Thirdly To explain the eight harmonic modes re jected by Ptolemey and give at large his reasons for excluding them Fourthly To point out something of the origin of the two doctrines Fifthly To shew how far the preceding explana tions may be supported by arguments or war ranted by the testimony of antient writers Lastly To consider how this subject has been un derstood by Meibomius Wallis and some few others that have wrote since and in what respect their explanations differ from my own I now proceed to the first head viz First To explain the harmonic doctrine as far as concerns the seven modes admitted by Pto lemey The harmonic doctrine of the tones we find ex presly delivered in the harmonic treatises which probably is the reason why among the moderns the later writers at least have for the most part deter mined themselves in its favour how justly it is in titled to the preference I shall have sufficient occasion to examine The treatises on harmonic that are come down to us are mostly Aristoxenian which school seems to have treated the science if not better at least698 least more methodically than any other of which we can now form a judgment and hence we find their divisions often adopted by antient writers who might not perhaps be ready to admit all their principles In considering the physical properties of sound and the ratios of intervals the Aristoxenians appear to have been less exact than the Pythagoreans the doc trines of the former being more adapted to the gross and familiar notions of the practical musician than to the accurate speculations of the philosopher But however exceptionable their treatises may have been in this respect they are the more valuable to us on this very account as they give more light into the an tient practice of music which is what is chiefly de sired the philosophic principles of the science being better understood By this school harmonic was di vided into these seven parts 1 of sounds 2 of in tervals 3 of genera 4 of systems 5 of tones 6 of mutations 7 of melopaeia The propriety of their adding this last division I shall have occasion to consider Of these divisions it was the fifth which contained the doctrine in question but to complete it the sixth must also be taken in for amongst other mutations that of the tones was there treated of and was indeed the most considerable object of that division This doctrine taught that the dif ference between one tone and another lay in the ten sion or pitch of the system The system by which I mean the greater perfect one exclusive of the less of which I shall have little occasion to speak con sisted of fifteen sounds extending to a disdiapason or double octave How these sounds were denominated and at what intervals they succeeded each other in the699 the diatonic genus to which I shall confine this ex planation is so well known that I need say no more concerning the structure of the system than that it answered to that of our natural scale beginning with Are and ending with Alamire This system was held immutable as to the relation of its parts one to another that is the order of sounds and intervals by which it proceeded was in the same genus to be always the same but the tension or pitch of the whole was variable a different one being assigned for each mode The explanation therefore usually given of the system by comparing it as I have done to a double octave from A in our natural scale is not to be understood as fixing its pitch but as shew ing its succession only which might as well be done by a double octave from B taking C  and F  into the scale or from any other note taking in the flats and sharps necessary to make the tones and semitones follow in the same order The relation of the parts to each other in the system being immutable the fixing the pitch of any one sound in it for any mode was sufficient to deter mine that of all the rest For this purpose the sound mese was commonly used which by its situation was well adapted to it being the middle sound of the system If therefore we settle the position of the mese for each mode we shall do all that is re quisite for the clearing up and establishing the har monic doctrine which considered the modes as dif fering only in the pitch of the system The modes admitted by the Aristoxenians were thirteen in number to which two more were added by later harmonicians and to the mese of each of V O L LI 4 X these700 these fifteen a distinct pitch was assigned but as Ptolemey has rejected eight of them I shall as I have proposed first separately consider the positions of the mese for the seven modes he admits Concerning the relative pitch of the respective meses for these seven modes I find no disagreement amongst the harmonic writers There are not want ing indeed who charge the antients with giving in respect thereto contradictory accounts Amongst others the learned Dr Gregory asserts that Aristides Quintilianus inverts the order of the modes 1 but what led the doctor into this mistake was his not distinguishing the double doctrine Aristides in the passage cited is not speaking of the pitch of the system for the seven modes in question but of the seven species of diapason as they lay in the system which was indeed in the inverted order of the meses of the seven modes as will appear when we come to consider the other doctrine This then is no contradiction in the Greek writer nor if it were would it be chargeable singly on him since if the doctor had but cast his eye on his own Euclid 2 he would have met with the very same doctrine he found in Aristides But his remark is indeed en tirely without foundation and I make no scruple to assert that the antients agree in their accounts of the relative pitch of the meses for these seven modes 1 Atque Aristides Quintilianus pag 18 editionis Meibo mianae tonum Hypodorium acutiorem facit quam Dorium et Hypophrygium quam Phrygium et Hypolydium quam Lydium Vide Praefat ad Opera Euclid 2 Pag 540 vers 6 et seq seu pag 15 vers 15 edit Meibom for701 for though many of the harmonic writers treat of the thirteen or fifteen modes all together without distin guishing the seven in question yet they have given them in such order and at such distances that the seven stand at the same intervals from each other as are assigned for them by those who have treated of them separately so that all the accounts agree in this particular The direction we may conveniently take from Bacchius 3 where it is clearly and concisely delivered and where it appears that the Mixolydian was the most acute the Lydian graver by a semi tone the Phrygian graver than the Lydian by a tone the Dorian graver than the Phrygian by a tone the Hypolydian graver than the Dorian by a semitone the Hypophrygian graver than the Hypo lydian by a tone and the Hypodorian graver than the Hypophrygian by a tone Now as the Guido nian scale in use amongst the moderns when stripped of Guidos additions answers to the system of the antients in its natural situation which was in the Dorian mode and our Alamire consequently an swers to the pitch of the Dorian mese we have a plain direction for finding the absolute pitch of the meses for all the seven in our modern notes and they will be found to stand thus Mixolydian mese in d Hypolydian in   g  Lydian in    c  Hypophrygian in  f  Phrygian in   b Hypodorian in   e Dorian in    a But to understand this doctrine as it is delivered by the antients it will be necessary also to examine how 3 Pag 12 edit Meibom 4 X 2 the702 the meses of the seven modes were stationed upon the lyre and in order to this we must consider the structure of that instrument The lyre after its last en largement consisted of fifteen strings which took in the compass of a disdiapason or double octave These strings were called by the same names as the fifteen sounds of the system and when tuned for the Dorian mode corresponded exactly with them Indeed there can be no doubt but that the theory of the system had been originally drawn from the practice of the lyre in this mode which was the favourite one of the Greeks as the lyre was also their favourite in strument In this mode then the mese of the system was placed in the mese of the lyre but in every one of the rest it was applied to a different string and every sound of the system transposed accordingly Hence arose the distinction between a sound in power and a sound in position for when the system was transposed from the Dorian to any other mode sup pose for instance to the Phrygian the mese of the lyre though still mese in position acquired in this case the power of the lichanos meson and the pa ramese of the lyre though still paramese in position acquired the power of the mese In these transpo sitions one or more of the strings always required new tunings to preserve the relations of the system but notwithstanding this alteration of their pitch they retained their old names when spoken of in respect to their positions only for the name implied not any particular pitch of the string but only its place upon the lyre in the numerical order reckoning the proslambanomenos for the first I thought703 I thought this remark the more necessary as I suspect it was the not attending to this circumstance that led Dr Wallis to assign c and g natural for the places of the mese in the Lydian and Hypolydian modes instead of c  and g  where I have placed them 4 But to return We are now to give the places of the mese for these seven modes upon the lyre which are thus settled by Ptolemey 5 String Mixolydian Paranetediezeugmenon 11 Lydian Tritediezeugmenon  10 Phrygian Paramese     9 Dorian Mese in Mese      8 Hypolydian Lichanos meson   7 Hypophrygian Parhypate meson   6 Hypodorian Hypate meson    5 The positions assigned for the meses of these seven modes by the harmonic doctrine being thus settled both in our modern scale and upon the lyre I come now Secondly To explain the musical doctrine of the same modes and shew its agreement with the harmonic The musical doctrine taught that the difference between one mode and another consisted in the man ner of dividing an octave or as the antients express it in the different species of diapason The ele mentary principles of these species we find delivered 4 See his edition of Ptolemey p 137 5 Ibidem in704 in the harmonic writers but as in the Aristoxenian treatises they are not found under the fifth division of tones nor under the sixth of mutations where it was natural to expect them but under the fourth of systems and it not being there expresly affirmed that the species had a relation to the tones though from their denominations and other circumstances it might well be inferred this has created a difficulty in admitting their connection with the subject The obviating of this objection I shall reserve for my fifth head where I shall take occasion particularly to justify this doctrine and the use I shall have made of it and I shall therefore proceed to explain it as I find it in the harmonic writers To understand how this doctrine of the species of diapason came to be treated under the head of systems it will be necessary to consider the definition given of the term system by the Aristoxenians and their subdivision of this branch of harmonic With this school whatever consisted of more than one interval was a system So comprehensive a de finition could not but make this branch a very large one and so we accordingly find it It was subdivided in the manner following systems were there con sidered as differing in respect first to magnitude secondly to genus thirdly to the being consonant or dissonant fourthly to the being rational or irra tional fifthly to the being sequent or transgressive sixthly to the being conjunct or disjunct seventhly to the being mutable or immutable Now of these seven differences it was under the third that the doc trine of the species of diapason came to be treated the consonant systems being there enumerated and explained705 explained By a consonant system was understood a system whose extreme or comprehending sounds were consonant of these there were six within the compass of the immutable system viz the diatessa ron diapente diapason diapason and diatessaron diapason and diapente and disdiapason These con sonant systems were considered as admitting each of a variety in the order of the intervals of which it was composed A system of a determined magnitude composed of the same intervals and of the same number of them might if the component intervals were not equal differ in respect to their order or succession These variations of each system they called  its species or  its figure for these terms were synonymous 6 The species of diatessaron were three those of the diapente four and those of the diapason seven being the sum of the species of the other two consonances of which the diapason itself was composed and here the doctrine of the species stopped for in the three larger consonant systems they seem not to have considered the species of the whole magnitude but only those of the three smaller systems of which they were composed and which are called by Ptolemey the first consonances 7 As the species of diatessaron and diapente do not immediately concern this doctrine the explaining them will be unnecessary and I shall therefore pro ceed to those of the diapason 6    Aristox p 74 v 9 7     lib ii c 3 Concerning 3706 Concerning these I find no disagreement amongst the writers of antiquity they all agree that they were seven in number and had the denominations of Mixolydian Lydian Phrygian Dorian Hypo lydian Hypophrygian and Hypodorian circum stances which leave no doubt of their connection with the modes The succession of intervals or manner of dividing the diapason for each species has been variously explained by the antient writers but the result of these explanations is the same except ing the generic differences It will be sufficient here to give what respects the diatonic genus only as the question concerning the tones does not turn upon the distinction of the genera In the diatonic genus the diapason consisting of five tonic and two semitonic intervals the Ari stoxenians fixed the succession for each species by the position of the two semitones shewing at the same time between which of the sounds of the immutable system the species in question was comprehended for this system consisting of fifteen sounds contained eight octaves two of which viz that from proslambanomenos to mese and that from mese again to netehyperboleon were divided after the same manner and therefore con stituted the same species but the six others were all differently divided so that the system con tained within itself the seven species of diapason and thence obtained the denomination of perfect the lesser perfect system which reached only to a diapason and diatessaron being improperly so called for want of this qualification as Ptolemey has707 has shewn 8 According to this method of ex plaining the species of diapason they stand as fol lows From hypate hypaton to para mese Species 1 Mixolydian Semitones first interval in the grave fourth in the acute From parhypate hypaton to trite diezeugmenon 2 Lydian Semitones third interval in the grave first in the acute From lichanos meson to paranete diezeugmenon 3 Phrygian Semitones second interval in the grave second in the acute From hypate meson to nete die zeugmenon 4 Dorian Semitones first interval in the grave third in the acute From parhypate meson to trite hy perbolaeon 5 Hypolydian Semitones fourth interval in the grave first in the acute From lichanos meson to paranete hyperbolaeon 6 Hypophrygian Semitones third interval in the grave second in the acute 8     Ptol Harm p 106 v 3 V O L LI 4 Y 7 Hypo708 From mese to nete hyperbolaeon or prosl to mese Species 7 Hypodorian Semitones second interval in the grave third in the acute It must be here observed that these species as they stand in the system are with respect to acute ness and gravity in the inverted order of the seven modes as settled by the harmonic doctrine which will account for the mistake which Dr Gregory as was shewn above and others have fallen into in imagining the antients did not agree in their accounts of the modes since it is plain these writers did not observe that in the one case the modes were spoken of with respect to the position of the system itself and in the other with respect to the position of the seven species within the system These species may also be more readily shewn by examples out of the Guidonian scale where keeping the natural notes they will stand thus Mixolydian B to b Lydian C to c Phrygian D to d Dorian from E to e Hypolydian F to f Hypophrygian G to g Hypodorian e to a a or A to a But as well this as the former way of shewing them we are to understand only as exemplifications of the succession of the intervals and not as an assign ment of the pitch for each which was to depend on that of the system out of which they are exemplified and709 and it may not be amiss therefore in order to pre vent any limited conception of these species to state generally the order of the intervals of which each is composed which will be as follows proceeding in each from grave to acute Mixolydian Semitone tone tone semitone tone tone tone Lydian Tone tone semitone tone tone tone semitone Phrygian Tone semitone tone tone tone semitone tone Dorian Semitone tone tone tone semitone tone tone Hypolydian Tone tone tone semitone tone tone semitone Hypophrygian Tone tone semitone tone tone semitone tone Hypodorian Tone semitone tone tone semitone tone tone Besides the manner abovementioned of explaining the species of diapason the antients have given us another the result of which is the same and that is by the position of the diazeuctic tone or interval from mese to paramese In the Mixolydian species the diazeuctic tone was the first interval reckoning from acute to grave in the Lydian it was the se cond in the Phrygian the third in the Dorian the fourth in the Hypolydian the fifth in the Hypophrygian the sixth and in the Hypodorian the last Now either of these methods fixes the succession of intervals peculiar to each species but as the examples are taken from a system whose pitch was variable we are still to seek at what absolute pitch the several species were taken in the modes to which we suppose them to have been respectively subser vient and it is perhaps the seeming difficulty of settling this that has induced so many to reject this doctrine entirely and fall in with the harmonic writers who considered the modes as differing only 4 Y 2 in710 in the pitch of the system but by taking in the assistance of the harmonic doctrine we shall not only gain the true pitch for each species in the musical but be led to see the agreement between the two doctrines which I have already said was my prin cipal view in these sheets and which having gone through the explanation of each doctrine separately as far as concerns the seven modes we are now ripe for considering for the eight modes whose expla nation I have deferred have no concern in this agree ment being rejected by Ptolemey as will appear for this very reason in substance that they would stand the trial of the harmonic doctrine only whereas the rest had the support of both Let us then con sider how the two doctrines as I have explained them may be made to agree By the harmonic doctrine we are told the pitch of the system for each mode and by the musical in what part of the system to take the species of dia pason now by combining these two directions we gain the following plain canon for finding any mode required C A N O N First pitch the system for the mode as directed by the harmonic doctrine then select from it the diapason directed by the musical and we have the characteristic species of the mode in its true pitch To make this more plainly appear and also to avoid the length of particular explanations I have annexed a diagram of the seven species which will shew at what pitch of the Guidonian scale each sound ofD I A G R A M I Of the Species of Diapason in the Seven Modes admitted Mixolydian Lydian Phrygian Dorian Hypolydian e Paramese e Trite diez e

of the diapason is brought out by the canon for each of the seven modes As in the construction of this diagram the directions of the canon have been strictly pursued so it will appear that the result of it is in all respects conformable to the principles of both doctrines Thus in the Dorian for instance it will be seen that the mese is placed in Alamire and that the rest of the sounds exhibited in that diapason are placed at the proper distances for preserving the order of the system as required by the harmonic doctrine It will be also seen that the diapason se lected lies between hypate meson and nete diezeug menon that the semitones are the first interval in the grave and third in the acute and that the dia zeuctic tone is in the fourth interval reckoning from the acute all which circumstances were also required by the musical doctrine for this mode and in the rest of the modes all the circumstances required by each doctrine will in like manner be found to ob tain so that no objection can well be raised to the principles on which the diagram has been framed by the favourers of either doctrine separately and the very coincidence of the two doctrines therein might furnish a probable argument in justification of the manner in which I have combined them in the canon But as I propose to consider this under the fifth head where the proofs will be collected I shall leave this argument for the present and proceed to explain Thirdly The eight harmonic modes rejected by Ptolemey and give at large his reasons for ex cluding them Six712 Six of these modes with the seven Ptolemey al lowed made up the thirteen allowed by the Aristo xenians the other two seem to have been added afterwards more with a view to regularity in the names and positions of the modes than to any par ticular use as will appear in the course of the ex planation For the settling these eight modes I shall have no occasion to go farther than the fixing the position of the mese for each according to the harmonic doctrine the result of applying the musi cal doctrine to them will sufficiently appear when I come to explain the reasons which Ptolemey has assigned for rejecting tem The old Dorian Phrygian and Lydian modes having as we have seen their meses respectively in a b c  at the distance of a tone from each other these tonic spaces were afterwards divided to make room for the Ionian mese in b flat and the AEolian in c natural To these five modes whose meses suc ceeded each other at the interval of a semitone and which came in time to be called the middle modes five others were made to correspond that lay re spectively graver by a fourth and took their deno minations from them but compounded with the preposition hypo to distinguish them Of these we have already shewn the Hypodorian mese to have been in e the Hypophrygian in f  and the Hypo lydian in g  Now the two tonic spaces between e f  and g  being likewise divisible the Hypo ionian mese was inserted in f natural and the Hypo aeolian in g natural at a fourth respectively from the Ionian and AEolian To these ten modes it was con ceived that five more might properly be ranged towards713 towards the acute at the distances of a fourth re spectively from the five first mentioned and taking their denominations from them also but compounded with the preposition hyper which would complete them to fifteen divided into five grave five middle and five acute But the Aristoxenians limiting the positions of the mese to the compass of an octave had established only three out of these last five viz the old Mixolydian whose mese we have shewn to be in d at a fourth from the Dorian and which was therefore afterwards called Hyperdorian the Hyperionian whose mese was in e flat at a fourth from the Ionian and the Hypermixolydian for so it had been originally named the preposition being taken in a different sense the mese of which was in e at a fourth from the Phrygian and which was there fore afterwards called the Hyperphrygian To make these acute modes therefore five in number as well as the grave and middle ones two new modes were added viz the Hyperaeolian whose mese was in f and the Hyperlydian whose mese was in f  at a fourth respectively from the AEolian and Lydian The modes being thus augmented to fifteen upon the single principle of the harmonic doctrine their meses will be found to stand all together in the fol lowing order Hyperlydian       in f  Hyperaeolian        f Acute Hyperphrygian or Hypermixolydian  e Hyperionian        e b Hyperdorian or Mixolydian    d Middle 3714 Lydian

Having now shewn how these fifteen modes were situated according to the harmonic doctrine I come to the objections raised by Ptolemey against the eight last explained For the right understanding of which it will be necessary to give an account of all that he has delivered on the subject of the modes a task of some difficulty for though his reasoning appears to me most clear and methodical it is rather too prolix to be given exactly in his own words as this with the necessary explanations of those passages of which the sense is less obvious would carry me to too great a length I must therefore endeavour to abridge his doctrines though at the hazard of leaving out some of the substantial parts and thereby doing injustice to his argument It will be expedient to premise something con cerning his apparent intention and method of reason ing in this part of his work which will serve as a key to his argument and this seems the more necessary as he has been thought by some 9 to 9 So obscurely has the best of all the antient writers Ptolemey delivered himself on this article the tones that deserved to have been most clearly handled Malcolms Treatise on Music p 539 have715 have written very obscurely upon the subject His chief view was to reduce the fifteen modes admitted upon the principle of the harmonic doctrine to those seven which had the support also of the musical but this reformation was to be attempted with great precaution on account of the obstinate prejudices it was likely to meet with from the harmonicians of his own time And we shall therefore find him first artfully treating the modes upon the foot of the har monic doctrine only and arguing ad homines for the reduction of the modes even upon their own prin ciples but before he drops the subject his true reasons will appear and indeed it will easily be seen that he had them constantly in view from the first though he does not argue openly upon them This will account for that mixture of the two doc trines which is found in his writings and will with the assistance of a few explanations render intel ligible what he has delivered upon the subject The tones he considers after the harmonic doc trine as mutations by whole constitutions which he tells us are therefore properly called tones as they are differences in respect to tension These differences he admits to be infinite in possibility but argues that in efficacy and in respect to sense they are finite and liable to certain limitations These limitations he derives from the theory of the consonances by which means he lays a foundation for his future argument for reducing the modes to the number of species of the consonance diapason The limitations of the tones which he proposes to regulate by those of the con sonances are as he tells us threefold viz V O L LI 4 Z 1 As716 1 As to the distance or ratio as he expresses it of the extreme tones for the Pythagoreans whose method he adopts with some improvements of his own measured intervals by the ratios of the com prehending sounds 2 As to the number of tones to be admitted be tween these extremes And 3 As to the intervals at which they were to stand in succession which he calls their excesses Thus in the diatessaron consonance which he in stances these three circumstances are observable first That the ratio of the extreme sounds is sesqui tertian secondly That the component intervals or ratios are three and thirdly That such and such are the differences of those ratios meaning the inter vals in succession But here he observes that in the consonances these limitations have each their distinct cause whereas in the tones the first being determined the other two necessarily followed as being dependent on the same conditions This re mark will hardly be intelligible without some ex planation The interval or ratio of the extreme sounds in each consonance though differently treated by the Aristoxenian and Pythagorean schools were yet determined both by the one and the other upon principles which concerned not their inter mediate division their intermediate division again was settled by a doctrine that required in the com position of intervals either that every fourth sound should complete the diatessaron or every fifth the diapente without one or other of which cir cumstances the composition was held inconcin nous717 nous 10 and hence the diatessaron could not be di vided into more than three ratios nor the diapente into more than four and again the excesses of the ratios or intervals in succession were assigned by the doc trine of the genera so that in the consonances each of the three limitations had a separate cause but in applying the same limitations to the tones there was a connection between them so that the determining the first determined the rest Thus for instance if the interval diatessaron or sequitertian ratio should be assigned for the limitation of the extreme tones the other limitations could only be such as were assigned for that consonance that is the component ratios must be three and the excesses of those ratios such as were established for the diatessaron by the doctrine of the genera But the not knowing the necessity of this consequence he tells us had occa sioned a great disagreement amongst the harmonicians in determining these points some making the inter val of the extreme tones less than a diapason others equal to it and others again exceeding it the later harmonicians in particular being fond of adding something to what had been admitted by those who went before them To bring these various opinions to some determination he proposes the restitution of similitude in the hermosmenon or harmonised melos as the chief circumstance by which to regulate the 10      Aristox p 54 edit Meibom 2 Z 2 first718 first limitation and this he says is effected by the diapason for at that distance there was always a return of similar harmony so that the tone that was a diapason distant from that first taken was a repeti tion of it and the tone still farther distant as for in stance at a diapason and diatessaron the same with the tone distant a diatessaron only and so of the rest For a proof of this he appeals to the practice of music where it was well known that in such mu tations as were at the interval of a diapason no one of the strings required new tuning though in all other mutations some alterations were necessary And hence he concludes that those who make the distance of the extreme tones less than the diapason do not restitute the hermosmenon there being still other tones beyond the limit they assign unlike to those before taken and that those who exceed the diapa son admit redundancies by repeating some of the harmonies before taken and further insists that even they who proceeded no farther than the diapason were yet to blame inasmuch as they took in the tone that was a diapason distant from the first since in so doing they admitted one redundancy and thereby gave a handle to those whom they charged with passing the proper limits for the modes to accuse them in turn with being really the authors of this licence since if one useless tone be admitted the same privilege may be fairly claimed for a greater number This last argument seems levelled at the Aristoxenians who admitted no more than thirteen modes because they would not exceed the diapason but whose Hyperphrygian was according to this argument a repetition of the Hypodorian The author719 author supports this argument still farther by an appeal to the circumstance of the species of diapason the sounds of which were eight but the number of the species seven only answering not to the number of terms in the division but to that of the component ratios for that the diapason taken from the gravest sound towards the grave yielded the same species with the first diapason taken from the acutest sound towards the same parts was out of dispute it hold ing true universally that whatever takes its beginning in the same manner from either of the extremes of the diapason produces the same power And here he leaves the first limitation without expresly assigning the interval for the extreme tones for the title of the chapter which seems to fix it to a diapason ought to be understood only in this sense that it should not exceed it which agrees with the reasoning in the chapter itself As to the conclusion which depended on the two other limitations if I may venture to draw it for him it will stand thus that into what number soever of terms the diapason be divided the distance for the extreme tones should be the interval between the first term and the last but one The first limitation being thus far considered he proceeds to determine the next upon which de pended the number of the tones and here he again opposes the Aristoxenians rejecting by his theory of this limitation sive of their thirteen modes besides the Hyperphrygian which stood condemned by the former one and leaving only seven according to the number of the species of diapason which he pro poses as the properest rule by which to govern this limitation and assigns for this the following reasons The720 The number of the species of diapason was equal to that of the species of the two first consonances taken together and the species of these last were taken ac cording to the condition of the ratios in each the number of which the very nature of them would not permit to be either increased or diminished Now the tones contained within the diapason following the nature of the consonances and being indeed esta blished on their account viz that the whole systems might have consonant differences he argues that those who were either for admitting more than seven which was the number both of the species and of the ratios in the diapason or for making all the excesses of the tones equal were not to be assented to since they could not assign any satisfactory reason either for the equality of the increments in general which in the harmonic genus was particularly inconvenient or for fixing either on the tone hemitone or diesis in particular for the common excess from the sup position of one or other of which they determined the number of tones according to the number of such intervals contained within the diapason For what was there to determine such a preference when the consonance meaning the diapason was as they themselves allowed susceptible not only of all these excesses but of many others in the orders both of the genera and of the distances Nor could they say that such a magnitude divides the diapason exactly and such another not exactly or one perhaps into an even number of parts and another into an uneven for though the diapason was divided into six by the tone into twelve by the hemitone into eighteen by the third of the tone and into twentyfour by the quarter721 quarter yet in all these divisions there was a vari ation from the exact truth even perceptible to the ear All this reasoning is again manifestly levelled at the Aristoxenians who falsely esteeming the dia pason to consist exactly of six tones or twelve hemi tones had admitted thirteen modes at the distance of a semitone from each other and here we see the author still combats them fairly on the principles of the harmonic doctrine But to go on with his ar guments having thus fixed the number of the modes to seven only he proceeds to consider the third li mitation It will be asked says he what are to be the excesses chosen for these seven modes since the diapason cannot be divided into seven equal parts and if unequal intervals be admitted there is still room for variety in the choice In answer to this he proposes that the intervals in question shall be taken by means of the first consonances diatessa ron and diapente and their differences or excesses whatsoever they may be for he argues that the mutations by consonant intervals ought to be first established and next to these the mutations by concinnous intervals Those who admitted eight tones he tells us had found their positions after the following manner The Dorian Phrygian and Lydian the three most antient being first set at the distance of a tone from each other they made the next mutation consonant at a diatessaron from the Dorian towards the acute and at a limma from the Lydian calling it Mixolydian because it lay not at the distance of a tone from the Lydian but only at the distance of a limma or difference between ditonus and diatessaron then this new mode having the722 the Dorian graver than it by a diatessaron that the rest of the four might be attended with the like cir cumstance they established the Hypolydian Hypo phrygian and Hypodorian a diatessaron graver re spectively than the Lydian Phrygian and Dorian and lastly they placed the Hypermixolydian at a diapason from the Hypodorian towards the acute giving it that denomination from its position above the Mixolydian misusing as he tells us the prepo sition hypo to signify the grave and hyper to express the acute But though the result of this method is the same with that of his own excepting as to the Hypermixolydian which he excludes for the reason assigned in treating of the first limitation yet he ob jects to it because the concinnous intervals are first assumed which ought to be taken by the conso nances and gives his own which is by the con tinual addition of the consonance diatessaron but however within the compass of the diapason Wherefore when such addition would exceed it he directs taking the diapente in its stead the contrary way whereby the division will be kept within the limits assigned This method and its result will perhaps be better understood and will also be more succinctly couched in our modern expressions in which I shall therefore give it applying to it the cor responding characters of the Guidonian scale Having first taken the Mixolydian tone which was the acutest of the seven suppose in D fall a fourth to A for the Dorian another fourth to E for the Hypodorian then to avoid passing the bounds of the diapason rise a fifth to B for the Phrygian fall a fourth again to f for the Hypo phrygian 3723 phrygian rise a fifth to c  for the Lydian and fall a fourth to G for the Hypolydian By this method the positions of the seven modes come out exactly as I fixed them from Bacchius in explaining the harmonic doctrine and we see that for settling them Ptolemey has really recourse to no other theory of the modes than that admitted by those he contends with though he makes the species of the consonances and those of the diapason more particu larly the governing rule for fixing their positions as the only means by which the two doctrines could be made to coincide But it remained after thus settling the seven modes to shew more fully the consequence of following the method of the Aristoxenians and others who divided the tonic spaces found by his method and placed the modes in a semitonic succes sion by which their number had been raised to thir teen even within the compass of the diapason and in doing this we shall find he ventures to assign the true reason for his reduction which was grounded on the musical doctrine This argument which is contained in the eleventh chapter of his second book being very remarkable and seeming strongly to sup port the combination of the two doctrines in the dia gram I have given of the seven modes I shall give a translation of the whole chapter left I should be thought to strain his arguments in favour of the mu sical doctrine which has been thought by many to have little or no relation to the modes and which if we except what this author has delivered seems indeed upon a slight examination and comparison of the evidence to have the weaker support V O L LI 5 A Now724 Now these being the tones we have established it is plain that a certain sound of the diapason is ap propriated to the mese in power of each by reason of their being equal in number to the species For a diapason being selected out of the middle parts of the perfect system that is the parts from hypate meson in position to nete diezeugmenon because the voice is most pleased to be exercised about the middle me lodies seldom running to the extremes because of the difficulty and constraint in immoderate intentions and remissions the mese in power of the Mixo lydian will be fitted to the place of paranete diezeug menon that the tone may in this diapason make the first species that of the Lydian to the place of trite diezeugmenon according to the second species that of the Phrygian to the place of paramese ac cording to the third species that of the Dorian to the place of the mese making the fourth and middle spaces of the diapason that of the Hypolydian to the place of lichanos meson according to the fifth species that of the Hypophrygian to the place of parhypate meson according to the sixth species that of the Hypodorian to the place of hypate meson ac cording to the seventh species that so it may be pos sible in the alterations required for the tones to keep some of the sounds of the system unmoved for pre serving the magnitude of the voice meaning the pitch of the diapason it being impossible for the same powers in different tones to fall upon the places of the same sounds But should we admit more tones than these as they do who augment their excesses by hemitones the meses of two tones must of ne cessity be applied to the place of one sound so that in725 in interchanging the tunings of those two tones the whole system in each must be removed not pre serving any one of the preceding tensions in common by which to regulate the proper pitch of the voice For the mese in power of the Hypodorian for in stance being fixed to hypate meson by position and that of the Hypophrygian to parhypate meson the tone taken between these two and called by them the graver Hypophrygian to distinguish it from the other acuter one must have its mese either in hypate as the Hypodorian or in parhypate as the acuter Hypophrygian which being the case when we in terchange the tuning of two such tones which use one common sound this sound is indeed altered a hemitone in pitch by intention or remission but having the same power in each of the tones viz that of the mese all the rest of the sounds are in tended or remitted in like manner for the sake of preserving the ratios to the mese the same with those taken before the mutation according to the genus common to both tones so that this tone is not to be held different in species from the former but the Hypodorian again or the same Hypophrygian only somewhat acuter or graver in its pitch That these seven tones therefore are sufficient and such as the ratios require be it thus far declared 11 With 11        5 A 2 726 With this chapter he ends his doctrine of the modes and of their reduction and we see he here makes the musical doctrine of the species the basis of his theory as far as concerns the rejecting the eight redundant modes though out of caution and to obviate objections he had established the seven upon the harmonic doctrine of the pitch of the    H    H   H  H   H   H   H                          To   Ptol lib ii c 11 system727 system That the force of his arguments in this chapter and the result of admitting the eight modes may be more plainly seen I have annexed a second diagram of the species as they lay in the spurious modes by which it will appear to which species in the genuine ones they severally answered and the objection raised against each of them by Ptolemey will become intelligible There is however an objection to which this second diagram seems liable It may be asked if the Hypoionian mode instanced by Ptolemey could give either Hypodorian or Hypophrygian harmony according as either the eighth or the ninth string was employed for its mese and if the rest of the spurious modes were liable to a like alternative what was it determined me in my choice of the two species in the construction of the diagram To which I an swer that the antients have decided for me as to five of them for we find 12 that the Hypoionian was called the graver Hypophrygian the Hypoaeolian the graver Hypolydian the Ionian the graver Phry gian the AEolian the graver Lydian and the Hy perionian the acuter Mixolydian And this by the way furnishes us with an unanswerable argument of the antiquity of the doctrine enforced by Ptolemey that the number of the modes ought not to exceed that of the species of the diapason for these appella tions which were given to the modes long enough before Ptolemey flourished can be accounted for on no other principle but the supposing the species of 12 Vide Euclid Introduct Harm p 19 v 29  seq Arist Quint p 23 v 7  seq diapason728 diapason to have been considered as the essential cha racters of the modes and that these five modes therefore though they had a difference in pitch were thought to be the same as to their effects with those after which they were thus named As to the other three the Hyperphrygian Hyperaeolian and Hyperlydian their meses being respectively at the distance of an octave from the Hypodorian Hypo ionian and Hypophrygian it was necessary to give them the same species with those three modes for a transposition of an octave was always understood to give a return of the same harmony as has been al ready shewn This second diagram and that of the seven ge nuine modes may be thought sufficient to render the subject intelligible however as the fifteen modes are parted in the two diagrams and confined also to the compass of a diapason for shewing the species I have added a table shewing the tuning of the fifteen strings of the lyre for all the modes The letters of Guidos scale placed within the squares shew in their horizontal orders the tunings of all the strings for each mode the two broader lines include the species of diapason and the meses are distinguished by capital letters by which means the cases where the same string is employed for the meses of two modes appear at the first view and the reasoning upon which Ptolemey rejects the eight modes is illustrated so as to need no farther explana tion Having now gone through with what I proposed to explain under the three first heads I come

something of the origin of the two doctrines The harmonic doctrine was as I have shewn ex presly taught in harmonic and therefore to account for its reception it will be necessary to consider the scope of that science The musical doctrine I have also shewn to have been explained in harmonic as far as concerned the elementary principles of the species of diapason but the application of those principles to the doctrine of the modes was not taught therein being reserved for melopaeia a science that looked higher than har monic and considered the use of the elements when in the hands of the poet or musician It is to this science therefore that we must look for the origin of the musical doctrine But before I consider the scope of either of these sciences it will be necessary to shew my reasons for separating them since they were blended by the Aristoxenians as has been shewn above For this purpose we must have recourse to the division of music the mother science which as treated by the antients comprehended all that the moderns now understand by music and poetry Its first general division according to Aristides Quintilianus 13 was into theoretic and practic The theoretic was sub divided into natural and artificial the latter of which was again subdivided into harmonic rhythmic and metric 13 De Musica p 7 See also Meibomius on the passage who has embraced the division of Aristides in the following table M U S I C AE730 metric which three sciences more particularly con tained the poets elements as teaching the grounds of tune time and verse But nothing less than a com petent knowlege of every branch of the mother science could carry with it the respected title of   the musician To harmonic rhythmic and metric in the theoretic respectively answered melopaeia rhythmopaeia and poetic in the practic In this authors division therefore we see that har monic and melopaeia are distinguished even by the first general division Of the propriety of this even the Aristoxenians seem to have been sensible since in order to justify their blending them they have defined harmonic as a science both theoretic and practic 14 And Aristoxenus himself in the frag ments we have under the false title of his three books of harmonic elements seems to assign such bounds to harmonic as might well be understood to exclude Physica Arithmeticam alia est pars quae dividitur in Physicam generi cognominem Theoretica cujus rursus Harmonicam partes duae Artificialis quae dividitur in Rhythmicam Metricam M U S I C AE Melopaeia Usualis Rhythmopaeia alia cujus partes Practica Poesis cujus item partes duae  Enarrativa cujus partes  Hypocritica 14   Euclid Introd Harmon initio melopaeia731 melopaeia 15 We have Plutarch also on our side who in a passage of his dialogue on music which I shall have occasion to cite amongst other proofs enumerates only the first six parts of harmoniac leaving melopaeia out of his division For this Mei bomius blames him 16 but too hastily for had the learned critic considered the whole passage he must have seen that the omission was not through ignorance but design the author being there ex presly arguing for the confining of harmonic within its proper bounds However whether the Aristo xenians were right or wrong in including melopaeia in harmonic my argument seems not materially af fected by it for they gave it only as a last division to be taught after all the rest had been inculcated and they agreed in defining it to be the use of the harmonic elements according to the propriety of each subject 17 which is distinction enough for the use I propose to make of it Having thus far justified my dividing these sci ences I shall now consider the scope of each which 15        Aristox p 1 init 16 Plutarchus dialogo de Musica sex tantum priores turbato etiam ordine recenset cum tamen crebram  mentionem injiciat adeoque non una ratione excusari illud potest Not in Gaudientium p 30 17   Euclid  Harmon p 2 v 5  p 22 v 18 V O L LI 5 B will732 will lead us to the origin of the doctrines they con tained The object of melopaeia was propriety in the use of the harmonic elements as appears from the de finition just cited In what this propriety consisted it is difficult to know as no collection of the rules of this science is come down to us it is not to be learnt from the harmonic writers who treat very slightly of this branch and those of them who are the fullest upon it as Aristides Quintilianus and Manuel Briennius wrote in later times when the fashion of music was changed and a new kind of melopaeia prevailed with the rules of which the earlier mu sicians could hardly have been acquainted as on the other hand many of the earlier rules must have been forgot or in a great measure disused There is more light to be procured from the dialogue of Plutarch and some others who speak occasionally of the practice of music I do not propose to collect any thing here upon this subject as indeed there does not seem to be sufficient materials left us for a thorough explanation of it which would require no less than a complete history of the science of its music and its improvements it is sufficient for my purpose to say that in the earlier times when the best music is supposed to have prevailed the genera modes rhythmi metres c were not employed indiscriminately nor even left to the discretion of the musician but were under particular restrictions which confined them to the arguments to which they were held respectively the best adapted and that it was from the mixture of these ingredients that arose the ethic character of the composition Hence the several nomi733 nomi took their rise of which there is in the dia logue of Plutarch an ample account As what I am now advancing cannot but be well known I need look no farther for the proof of it than to a passage of Platos third book of laws where he com plains of a licence beginning even in his time to the prejudice of the science Speaking of times past Our music says he was then divided according to certain species and figures thereof Prayers to the gods were one species of song to which they gave the name of hymns opposed to this was an other species which in particular might be called threni another paeones and another the birth of Dionysius which I hold to be the dithyrambus there were also citharaedic nomi so called as being still another song These and some others being prescribed it was not allowable to use one species of melos for another  But afterwards in process of time the poets first introduced an unlearned licence being poetic by nature but unskilled in the rules of the science trampling upon its laws over attentive to please mixing the threni with the hymns and the paeones with the dithyrambi imitating the music of the flute upon the cithara and confounding all things with all c 18 This 18         5 B 2 734 This passage with what has been said being suf ficient to give a general idea of the scope of melo paeia I shall pass to that of harmonic We have already seen that the theoretic division of music was by the author whose distribution I have followed subdivided into natural and artificial and that harmonic came under the latter The an tients indeed seem not all to have treated the sci ence under such narrow limits the physical proper ties of sound the ratios of intervals c appearing to have been considered therein by the Pythagorean and other schools as well as the structure of the systems in use But not to stop at this objection which is not very material thus far must be allowed that harmonic as to the greatest part of its scope was an artificial science its most considerable object being to explain and teach the denominations positions powers c of the sounds of the system and all other inventions in use for facilitating the study of music or bringing it to greater perfection Now in this short view of the science which is sufficient for our purpose we may already begin to account for the difference between its doctrines and those of me lopaeia artificial sciences being but too prone to ad mit doctrines for convenience that are repugnant to the truth This was indeed the case with harmonic as the two doctrines of the tones sufficiently testify the origin of which I shall now consider      Plat de Legibus lib iii The735 The musical doctrine I look upon as the most antient and that which exhibited the modes in their proper character for which reason it could not avoid making a part and probably the most essential one of the doctrines of melopaeia The precise time when it first came into use I pretend not in the midst of uncertainties to be able to determine but we may perhaps be near the truth if we refer its origin to the age of Pythagoras if the eighth string of the lyre was really as we are told the addition of that philosopher The story of his discovering at a forge the ratios of hypate mese paramese and nete is well known These ratios which gave rise to the harmonic proportion and the numbers of which were so vainly applied afterwards by philosophers to all the parts of the universe were drawn from the Dorian species of diapason which we cannot suppose to have been well understood till its form existed upon the instrument What doctrine of the modes prevailed before the addition of the eighth string we can only guess at for it was a question even with Aristotle 19 how the heptachord lyre had been ad justed and Nichomachus speaks of that instrument so 19      Aristot Probl sect 19 qu 7        Probl sect 19 qu 48 confusedly 4736 confusedly as to have given room for a supposition 20 that it had received two forms the seven strings answering in the oldest from to our notes e f g a b b c d and in the new one to e f g a b d e However this may have been neither the musical nor the harmonic doctrines could be then in use exactly as they were taught in after times and the probability seems to be that the modes were in those days characterized by the species of the lesser con sonances diatessaron and diapente but the theory of the Dorian species of diapason we may be sure took place about the time when the lyre was brought to that compass and the other species though they might have existed before in the melody of parti cular instruments as for instance the barbarous Phrygian upon its flute could hardly have been taken into the Greek theories of the science till the extensioon of their own favourite instrument had brought the diapason under consideration so that the origin of the musical doctrine of the modes is with great probability to be referred to this im provement of the lyre I come now to the harmonic doctrine for the origin of which we must look to the invention of the system The greater perfect system upon whose pitch the modes depended by the harmonic doctrine consisted as I have already shewn of fifteen sounds answerable to those of the lyre and it is reasonable 20 Ut ex his difficultatibus nos expediamus duas non opi niones sed aetates statuere debemus quibus aliter obtinuerint in tervalla in septem chordis Meibomius in Nichomachum p 52 See also Nichomachus p 9 v 14  seq  p 17 v 24  seq to737 to think that the structure of it was not settled till the instrument had been again extended to the com pass of a disdiapason by the additions of the tetra chords hyperbolaeon and hypaton and of the sound proslambanomenos for this change the age of Ale xander the Great may perhaps be a probable aera for in the musical problems of Aristotle I observe no mention of the new tetrachords though many of the questions concern the strings of the lyre and yet there is no doubt of their being in use in the time of Aristoxenus his disciple Should I be near the truth in this the musical doctrine will then appear to have been earlier than the harmonic by the whole period from Pythagoras to Alexander But without being sollicitous about the precise time when the har monic doctrine was introduced I shall with more certainty endeavour to point out what must have given occasion to it The study of the music of the antients though they seem not to have much used composition in parts must yet have been very perplexing from the variety only of the tones and genera and some help might well be thought necessary even in the time of the octachord lyre But when seven new strings were given to the instrument and these placed not all at one end but three at the acute and four at the grave the eight old strings upon which the cha racteristic species of melody for each mode had been always exhibited became confounded by these additions and possessing now the center of the lyre it was difficult to distinguish them and to preserve for each mode its proper character as before This dif ficulty must also have been increased by the change introduced738 introduced in the practice of the science for both the players and composers having now a greater la titude would not fail to take advantage of the en largement and though the skilful among them might in their excursions upon the new strings pre serve a due attention to the proper characters of the several modes yet the melody peculiar to each could not be so easily comprehended when carried beyond its usual limits An artificial help therefore to the learner was now become indispensably necessary and with this view I make no doubt but that the system was invented It was indeed admirably well contrived for the purpose for its succession being the same with that of the lyre in its Dorian tuning with which the Greeks must have been the best acquainted as being the proper mode of their favourite instrument it was the most easy to be learnt and retained and the knowlege of this succession was all now required for by imagining only the system removed to some other pitch and tuning all the strings in the same relations to a new mese the melody of the old eight strings was thereby changed and a new species of diapason gained thereon without the trouble of studying the the musical doctrine which was now left to the mu sician or melopaeius who was answerable for the choice of the successions he selected for his various subjects whilst the harmonician followed him through the intricacies of his compositions by the easier me thod of the transposition of the system And this I apprehend to have been the origin both of the system itself and of the harmonic doctrine of the tones But now as it often happens what was de signed for the improvement of the science became in739 in time the ruin of it for after the reception of the disdiapason system the elementary treatises as we see by what is left to us of them became filled with this new doctrine of the parts and relations of the system of its transpositions of the positions of the mese of sounds in power and sound by position and many other doctrines flowing from the same source till in time the system itself came to be considered as the true type of a mode and a number of new modes were introduced that were grounded on no other principle than this which I scruple not to call a false doctrine of them though the antients admitted it for convenience as I have shewn and thereby almost lost their impressions of the new one Having thus pointed out the origin of these two doctrines as far as was possible from a general view of them and without entering into a critical exami nation of the many passages of the antients that might help us to greater certainty I shall now pro ceed Fifthly To shew how far the preceding explana tions may be supported by arguments or war ranted by the testimony of antient writers Here I must repeat that the harmonic doctrine of the tones as I have explained it is found expresly delivered under its proper head in almost every writer on the subject and that the doctrine of the species of diapason is found also in the harmonic treatises though not under the head of tones nor ex presly applied to them Now this being the case I shall have no occasion to waste time in bringing V O L LI 5 C particular740 particular proofs to support the explanations I have given of these two doctrines separately What imme diately lies upon me is to prove that the doctrine of the species of diapason had a connection with the modes and to justify the manner in which I have combined the two doctrines in the canon and in the diagrams framed from it With this view therefore I shall direct my arguments to the proving of the five following points 1 That the doctrine of the species of diapason was a doctrine of the modes 2 That this doctrine was not distinct from nor independent of the harmonic but so connected with it that a mutation according to the one produced the alteration required by the other 3 That the species of diapason as taken practi cally on the lyre lay all at the same pitch 4 That this pitch was the diapason between the strings hypate meson and nete diezeugmenon as they stand in the diagram 5 I shall endeavour to shew that it was the musi cal doctrine and not the harmonic that exhibited the true character of the modes as considered in re spect to their effects To begin with the first point That the doctrine of the species of diapason was a doctrine of the modes might perhaps be inferred from some of the definitions given of a mode but as these defini tions are mostly intermixed with if not drawn solely from the harmonic doctrine and hence have given room for disputes I shall rest this point upon three arguments in which the definitions are not con cerned First741 First Because the species are denominated after seven of the modes which could hardly have arisen from any other cause than their connection with them 2dly Because the whole reasoning of Ptolemey in the sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth and ele venth chapters of his second book tends to reduce the modes to the number of the species of the dia pason which as far as his opinion goes is an ex press confirmation that the musical doctrine was a doctrine of the modes 3dly Because Ptolemey is not single in this opi nion as some may have thought but is supported in it by the Aristoxenian writers who though they admitted thirteen modes upon the false principle of the harmonic doctrine did in fact reduce them to eight on the very principle of Ptolemey calling the Hyperionian mode which gave the same species with the Mixolydian the acuter Mixolydian and calling also the AEolian the graver Lydian the Ionian the graver Phrygian the Hypoaeolian the graver Hypo lydian and the Hypoionian the graver Hypophry gian the former of all which modes gave re spectively the same species with the latter So that to make their doctrine answer to that of Ptolemey there wanted but the reduction of one mode more which was their Hyperphrygian And it is not to be conceived but that they saw this mode also to be a re petition of the Hypodorian but as this repetition was at the distance of an octave and the other five were repeated at the difference only of a semitone in pitch they could not have called this the acuter Hypodorian without using the same expression in too great a lati 5 C 2 tude742 tude of sense And this might be the reason why they omitted taking notice of that circumstance attending this mode though we might perhaps with safety to the argument go a step farther and suppose that the Aristoxenians might think a difference of an octave in pitch worthy of a distinct denomination though they would not allow it to that of a semi tone And this is the more probable as we find they did not absolutely reject these modes as Ptolemey did but admitted them upon the principles of the harmonic doctrine though by their denominating five of them from the genuine modes it is plain they acknowleged them to be superfluous in respect to the musical I cannot say more to this point without defrauding the subsequent ones and I shall therefore leave it with this remark that whatever is proved of the subsequent points and especially of the fifth must hold true of this a fortiori so that it may really be said to have the support of the whole testimony 2 To the second point the first diagram speaks very strongly for had the two doctrines no relation to each other no such coincidence as is there found could have been expected in the result of their com bination and this proof from the coincidence of the doctrines in the diagram becomes much stronger if we attend to these two circumstances First That in the canon upon which the diagram has been con structed there is no strain of either doctrine but a plain and natural combination of them as they are stated separately by the antient writers And secondly That the species of diapason as brought out by this combination all fall upon the strings of the old octachord743 octachord lyre where it was natural to expect them for when the lyre had but eight strings the species could be taken no where else and it cannot be thought but that after the extension of the instru ment they were taken at the same pitch as before unless we should suppose that the new strings brought with them an immediate change both of the theory and practice of the science which is most improbable We see our modern harpsichords have more keys given to them than those of the last cen tury and yet neither the positions of the cliffs nor any other circumstances attending our theories of the science have been altered by them But that this point may not rest wholly on the circumstances of the diagram I shall produce four passages that plainly shew the relation between the two doctrines The first from Aristoxenus Now as some of those systems which we employ in music are simple and others mutable we must treat of mutation and first of this what mutation is and how it is accomplished now I say there happens as it were a pathos in the melody afterwards how many mutations there are in all and according to what intervals 21 In this passage the author is speaking of the sixth division of harmonic which was mutation and more particularly of mutation with respect to tone which in this division was always treated upon the 21           corrige                  Aristox p 38 v 7 principle 3744 principle of the harmonic doctrine and is so here but he tells us there was a pathos in the melody which can only relate to the musical doctrine and therefore shews their connection In the next pass age from Aristides Quintilianus it is more plainly hinted at  For if a certain type of the voice follows each system it is manifest that the species of the melos will be altered with the harmonics 22 But the two following passages from Ptolemey will put the matter out of dispute  For we are not to imagine this constitution of the mutation according to the tone established for sake of graver or acuter voices since the intension or again the remission of whole instruments suffices for such a difference no alteration being produced in respect of the melos the whole being executed by performers of graver or acuter voices but with this view that the same melos begun by the same voice now from acuter places and now from graver may produce a certain change of ethos because that in the permutations of the tones the extremities of the voice do not answer to both the extremities of the melos but in one the extremity of the voice always falls short of that of the melos and in the other the extremity of the melos of that of the voice so as that the same melos which at first meaning in the Dorian an swered to the compass of the voice now falling short 22                     Aristid Quintil p 24 v ult of745 of it and now again exceeding it may give to the ear the impression of another mode 23  For of the mutations in respect to tone so called there are two principal differences the one by which we run through the whole melos in an acuter tension or again in a graver preserving always the succession of the species The other by which there is an al teration not of the whole melos in its tension but only of a part thereof from the succession it set out with Wherefore this last might be called rather a mutation of the melos than of the tone for ac cording to the former the melos is not altered but the tone tension of the whole whereas according to the latter the melos varies from its proper order and the tension varies not as tension but as on ac count of the melos Hence the former does not strike the sense with an idea of that alteration ac cording to power by which the ethos is changed but only of an alteration in respect to the being acuter or graver whereas the latter causes the sense to drop from the usual and expected melos the succession being preserved some time and then making a tran 23                            Ptol Harm lib ii c 7 sition746 sition to another species whether according to genus or tension 24 3 The third point will receive much support from these two considerations first That diapasons va riously divided and variously bounded also seem to form a more complicated theory than can well be supposed to have prevailed in early times when music had not yet lost its natural simplicity and secondly That the compass of the instrument in its octachord state would not admit of any variation in respect to the bounding sounds But there is testimony to this point also I shall cite one pretty remarkable passage from Aristides Quintilianus which will be sufficient as the proof of the next point necessarily carries this along with it Aristides who in his explanations of the harmonic doctrines follows the method of the Aristoxenians coming under the head of systems to treat of the species of diapason after explaining their situation in the immutable system and assigning their denominations immediately subjoins  Hence it is plain that if we make our first sign the same though denominated in different cases from 24                                Ptol Harm lib ii cap 6 a different747 a different power of sound the quality of the har mony will become manifest from the succession of the sounds in order 25 In this passage it is to be observed that the term  a sign signifies a musical character such as the antients used to write over the words of a song to express the air or tune and that each of these characters represented not a sound of the system sub ject to transposition but like the notes of our gamut a sound of a certain pitch or at least liable to very small variations only from the generic differences The term therefore is properly used here by Aristi des in opposition to  a sound of the system whose pitch depended on the mode in which it was employed As to the expression quality of the har mony it evidently respects the species of diapason so that the author plainly means to tell us that if we begin a diapason always with the same note the succession of its sounds that is the manner in which it is divided will determine the species and so far he speaks to our purpose But this point will re ceive farther proof from what we shall say upon the next 4 The fourth point being the natural result of the combination of the two doctrines carries a sort of conviction with it and the stronger as not only the seven modes but the whole fifteen assist the proof as will appear on examining the table I have given of them for there the sounds lying between the 25                     Arist Quint p 18 v 7 V O L LI 5 D strings748 strings hypate meson and nete diezeugmenon fall out so as to give the proper species for every mode which circumstance will not attend any other boun daries common or varying without altering the po sitions of the mese and thereby disturbing the har monic doctrine But we have from Ptolemey suf ficient testimony to this point In the eleventh chap ter of his second book of which I have given a trans lation above we see that the diapason in question is chosen by him to exhibit the divisions that belong to the several species Tis true he seems to in sinuate that any other diapason might have been chosen were it not for the difficulty the voice finds in running to the extremes and in this as a theorist he is right for musical relations and proportions considered as objects of mere speculation may be conceived at any pitch but in the case before us it was the practice of the instrument that governed the theory The pitch of the lyre had been made to answer to the double octave of the human voice the pitch of the system in the Dorian mode answered to that of the lyre and in every other mode the difference in pitch from that of the Dorian was de termined Now under such limitations that took their rise from practical music it is evident that no other diapason but that instanced by Ptolemey could have served his purpose But that the boundary of the species is rightly ad justed in the diagram there is yet another strong testi mony from the tables of Ptolemey annexed to the fifteenth chapter of book second To make this proof evident it will be necessary to give some account of this part of his work In749 In the twelfth chapter of book second he begins to treat of the sections of the harmonic canon for proving by experiment the truth of the ratios he had delivered for the genera and proposes to exhibit these sections for each genus in all the seven tones Then after shewing the defects of the monochord canon in use and chapter thirteenth the insufficiency of the improvements made thereon by Didymus he proposes and explains his own method of applying the canon to eight strings tuned in unison But be fore he proceeds to give the sections upon all the tones he thinks it necessary to shew by experiment the advantage of his own numbers above those of preceding harmonicians for which purpose the ex position of them in one tone that is in the immu table system was sufficient Accordingly in chapter fourteenth the greatest part of which has been lost and is supplied from conjecture by Wallis and in the tables annexed he gives the sections of the Dorian species of diapason where the diazeuctic tone lying in the middle left a complete tetrachord on each side for the exposition of the generic numbers and compares his own ratios with those of Archytas Eratosthenes Aristoxenus and Didymus Then in the fifteenth chapter he proceeds as he proposed to give the sections according to his own ratios for the genera most in use in all the seven tones these sec tions he has included in two sets of tables each set containing seven viz one for each mode and each table being again subdivided into five for the generic differences Now of these two sets of tables the first justifies the diagram for here he has given his numbers upon the eight strings from nete diezeug 5 D 2 menon750 menon to hypate meson so that the diagram and the tables agree in every respect except the generic differences which I had no occasion to consider In the second set indeed the numbers are applied to the diapason from mese to proslambanomenos and there being no explanation in this chapter of the distinct use of this second set nor any reason assigned for giving it but the convenience of having the op tion to begin the tuning from nete or mese 26 this may seem to furnish an objection to the proof pro posed to be gained from these tables but if we look forward to the second chapter of his third book we shall there see his meaning which I shall proceed to explain Having in the sixteenth chapter shewn how the numbers given in the two sets of tables are to be applied to an octachord canon he proposes in the first chapter of the third book to shew how the di visions for the fifteen sounds of the whole disdiapason system might if required be found according to the same ratios he had already assigned for the extent of a diapason Now for the doing this two inconveniences were to be obviated First If the in strument on which this experiment was to be tried was to receive an addition of seven strings to com plete the disdiapason and these additional strings were all to be in unison with the eight before applied it would happen that in shifting the moveable ma gas or bridge to the sections required those strings which were to exhibit the acute sections of the tetra 26            Ptol Harm p 174 v ult chord751 chord hyperbolaeon would have so little space left between the magas and the extremity of the string that it would be difficult for them to yield a distinct sound And secondly The canon must be crowded with these additional divisions which would also have its inconvenience To remedy this he proposes several methods the first of which is to fit the in strument with fifteen strings of which the eight that were to receive the divisions from mese to nete hyper bolaeon should be in unison at the pitch of mese and the other seven in unison at the pitch of pros lambanomenos Now as the succession from the string proslambanomenos to the string mese though it varied with the modes was yet in the same mode always the same with that from mese to nete hyper bolaeon the difference of a diapason in pitch excepted it is plain that under this adjustment a canon di vided for the one diapason would serve equally for the other the difference in pitch being established before in the open strings By this method there fore the divisions for the acuter diapason would be as large as those for the graver and the canon needed not to be crowded with a greater number of divisions than had been used for the single diapason by reason of its double application The other methods which he proposed I need not go through the explanation of farther than to remark that for those as well as for this a fresh set of numbers was necessary those con trived for the succession of the diapason from hypate meson to nete diezeugmenon being noways appli cable to a succession which began from proslamba nomenos or mese And this it seems was his reason for giving the second set of tables in his fifteenth chapter752 chapter as appears from his own words in the se cond chapter of the third book In general for such uses as comprehend a diapa son only it behoves us to employ out of the numbers exhibited those which contain the section from nete diezeugmenon that the melos may be taken in the middle tensions but for such as comprehend the dis diapason those exhibited from nete hyperbolaeon or mese that the tuning may be adjusted at both extre mities alike 27 Here we see he fully explains his former mean ing and in recommending his first set of tables for the uses of a diapason gives the same reason for the choice of that diapason in particular as he assigns for it in the eleventh chapter of the second book viz that the melos may possess the middle of the instrument But it must be observed that when the whole disdiapason has been adjusted by the second set of tables the tunings of the eight strings from nete diezeugmenon to hypate meson will come out for every mode and genus the very same as if they had been tuned by the first set so that no inference can possibly be drawn from thence either that the author has varied as to his own meaning or that the diagram which I have given does not correspond with it 27                Ptol Harm p 228 v 15 5 I753 5 I come now to the fifth point which has been the subject of much dispute and which might well afford an endless controversy whilst the union of the two doctrines was not understood for whatever rea sons from probability or testimony might be urged in favour of the musical the harmonic doctrine ap pearing to be still better supported and seeming to contradict the other was sure to suspend the deci sion at least if not gain one in its own favour But the agreement between the two doctrines being shewn and their views distinguished the testimony borne to the harmonic doctrine will no longer be in the way of the musical and we may safely allow whatever appears favourable to the latter its full weight I shall therefore offer in support of this point the six following arguments First No one accustomed to hear and judge of the effects of music can conceive that a mere alteration in pitch of the same melody though in the hands of the most artful master can have so powerful an effect to change the mode or style of composition as an alteration of the melodious succession or if this should be asserted it might be disproved by an ap peal to the works of all the composers of eminence among the moderns who having in all the variety of their modulations but one change that truly an swers to the musical doctrine of the modes viz the change of the succession of the same key from the major third to the minor have all reserved this change for their pathetic passages I shall give but one in stance of it from our countryman Purcell who in his Mad Bess has so happily introduced this change upon the words  Cold and hungry am I  grown754  grown that if the performer does justice to the composition the hearer can scarce help fancying him self affected with the very sensations with which the starts of frenzy are there pictured 2dly If I have been right in assigning a greater antiquity to the musical doctrine than to the har monic the effects of the modes must in earlier times at least be referred to the former And this carries with it an argument for later times also for the old principle of the modes could not be suddenly changed And though it may be urged from the in troduction of the eight spurious modes that the har monic doctrine came in time to be considered as a principle independent of the other this will only prove a corruption of the better doctrine which may safely be admitted though that the musical doctrine was ever quite disused unless in very late times in deed I much doubt as some traces of it are found in almost all the writers come down to us 3dly Ptolemeys rejecting the eight modes that wanted the support of the musical doctrine is an other proof For if the harmonic doctrine had been the more essential of the two those modes ought to have been preserved Nor does the admission of six of them by the Aristoxenians in earlier times weaken the force of this argument for though the rejecting them is conclusive against the harmonic doctrine as far as any weight is allowed to the opinion of the re jecter the argument from their admission will not conclude in its favour till it be proved that in the use the species of diapason afforded by these modes was not attended to but only the order from the pros lambanomenos in power of each as the favourers of the755 the harmonic doctrine seem to suppose and this proof it would not be easy to obtain since each of these modes had its species belonging to it and was only exceptionable because it repeated the melody of one or other of the seven 4thly The denominations given by the Aristo xenians to five of the spurious modes after the ge nuine ones whose species they afforded furnish an other strong proof for this could scarce have hap pened if the pitch of the system had been the prin cipal distinction 5thly We find in Plutarch Pliny and other authors the invention of particular modes ascribed to particular musicians which may be accounted for on the supposition that the modes were so many different species of diapason since it requires great art and skill to introduce agreeably melodies to which the ear has not been accustomed but the taking the same melody at a different pitch is a va riety for which the inventor would hardly have had his name so carefully delivered to posterity But 6thly there are passages that strongly con firm the preceding arguments Aristoxenus speaks of modes of the melopaei 28 by which I under stand him to mean the species of diapason in contra distinction to the modes of the harmonicians for I suspect the modes of melopaeia mentioned by Ari stides Quintilianus 29 and divided by him into three kinds viz nomic which was netoides di thyrambic which was mesoides and tragic which 28 Pag 40 v 21 29 Pag 29 v ult V O L LI 5 E was756 was hypatodies and which are also mentioned by other writers of a low age 30 these modes I say I suspect to be founded on distinctions not in use so early The use of the species of diapason in melo paeia is confirmed also by Bacchius who imme diately after explaining them expresses himself thus  So many therefore in the art of music are the species of the consonances by which every melopaeia is formed 31 And also by Aristides Quintilianus who concludes his doctrine of the species with these words  And thus much suffices concerning systems which the antients also styled the ethic princi ples 32 For by systems we are here to understand systems in the general sense as defined and treated by the Aristoxenians whom Aristides follows in this part of his work and more particularly the three consonant systems whose species he had just been describing The passage I have already cited from Plato serves also strongly to support this point for the terms species and figure are there used in the strict technic sense and not merely to express variety as appears from his speaking in the same passage afterwards of the species of melos the sense of which cannot be mistaken and that he is speaking of music in 30 Martianus Capella p 189 v 21 Manuel Bryennius in Oper  p 503 v 14 31                 Bacch Sen Introd Art Music p 19 v 18 32              Aristid Quintil p 18 v 12 respect757 respect to its effects is manifest from the whole passage so that though the modes are not directly mentioned they are necessarily to be implied But Ptolemey is still more express for in the passage cited above from book second chapter seventh he directly affirms that the ethos or character of the mode depended on the musical doctrine and not on the harmonic and is still more explicit to the same purpose in the passage cited also from the sixth chapter of the same book These two passages are so clear that there is no evading their testimony but by supposing the author to be singular in his opinion which there is indeed room to think was his case with respect to many of the musicians his contemporaries for the pains he has taken to clear up and distinguish the two doctrines is a sufficient proof that mistakes had prevailed concerning them but that what he has advanced is not repugnant to the doctrines held in earlier antiquity has I think been amply shewn I shall now close these proofs with three remarkable passages from Plutarchs dialogue on music which will all become intelligible from the explanation given of this subject at the same time that they will serve to confirm it The first respects the invention of the Mixolydian mode which we shall see he treats as a species of diapason telling us between what sounds of the system it lay and in what part of the diapason the diazeuctic tone was situated in both which circumstances the passage agrees with the preceding explanation and with the first diagram  Lysis informs us that Lamprocles the Athenian seeing that it the Mixolydian harmony had not the 5 E 2 disjunction758 disjunction diazeuctic tone where almost every one imagined meaning in the middle of the diapason for so it was in the Dorian which was most familiar to the Greeks but at the acute made the figure of it such as that from paramese to hypate meson 33 The next passage informs us of a very remarkable circumstance viz that after the addition made to the lyre of the tetrachord hypaton no use was made of those strings in the Dorian mode though they were employed in the rest Speaking of the earlier times and arguing that the antients had omitted many things rather from choice than ignorance  It is manifest says he that in respect to the tetrachord hypaton it was not through ignorance that they abstained in their Dorian compositions from this tetrachord for they employed it in the rest of the tones as plainly knowing it but for the sake of preserving the ethos they left it out in the Dorian tone as respecting the beauty thereof 34 From this passage it is evident that the Dorian melody which in its proper character according to the musical doctrine was terminated by hypate meson was in such esteem with the Greeks from a long habit of hearing their best pieces com posed in that succession and within that compass 33               Plutarch Dial de Musica 34                  Ibidem that759 that the additional strings could not be ventured upon in that mode though in the rest they were admitted The last passage is that which I have mentioned above to have been censured by Meibomius we shall see here that the author is expresly arguing for confining harmonic within its proper sphere and not suffering it to encroach on melopaeia by engaging with the rules of  in the use of the ele ments so that it both justifies and explains the di stinction I have made above between the two sci ences and turns the censure of Meibomius upon himself who seems indeed without excuse unless we suppose him to mean only that Plutarch in giving the Aristoxenian division ought not to have sunk any part of it which remark would have been just if Plutarch had given the division as such but he does not name the school though he adopts their distribution of the science as far as the six di visions he approved so that no inconsistence can be charged upon him The latter part of this passage also confirms the distinction I have made between the two doctrines and their use in the two sciences so that it assists most of the preceding arguments and proofs and here I shall therefore rest this point which will scarce be thought to need farther sup port For it is evident that the immediate objects of harmonic are genera viz those of the hermosme non intervals systems sounds tones and systematic mutations and farther than this it cannot go so that we ought not to expect it should determine how far the poet in his music has properly assumed the Hypo760 Hypodorian tone for instance for the outset or the Mixolydian and Dorian for the conclusion or the Hypophrygian and Phrygian for the middle since the harmonic treatise does not extend so far but has need of many others For of the force of propriety it cannot judge since neither the chromatic nor the enharmonic genus will ever contain a perfect force of propriety such as to discover the ethos of the com position that being the business of the artist And again it is plain that the voice pitch of the system is to be distinguished from the melopaeia wrought in the system the consideration whereof does not be long to the harmonic treatise 35 Having now finished my head of proofs I come Lastly To consider how far this subject has been understood by Meibomius Wallis and some few others that have wrote since and in what respect their explanations differ from my own In respect to the opinion of Meibomius Malcolm tells us that that writer in his notes on Aristides Quintilianus affirms the differences of the modes 35                             Plutarch Dial de Musica 5 upon761 upon which all the different effects depended to have been only in the tension or acuteness and gravity of the whole system 36 And indeed in the note on page 13 verse 4 of that author 37 which I pre sume Malcolm had under his eye Meibomius clearly decides for the harmonic doctrine as he does also in his note on page 2 verse 1 of Euclids Harmonic Introduction 38 But in this last note he had just before told us that tone was by the antients also called harmonia and species of diapason 39 And in the conclusion of his note on page 1 verse 10 of the same author he delivers himself more fully to the same purpose  The antients says he having considered several species of diapason in the bisdiapason called these also harmonics Whence we read Dorian Phrygian har mony in the best writers The same were again called tones and tropes or modes 40 IN 36 Malcolms Treatise on Music p 540 37 Hic autem locus oppido notandus est contra recentiorum de tonorum effectibus opiniones illorum enim varietates so la

of diapason or tone 41 which is the sense I have put upon it We see therefore that though he hastily ascribes to the harmonic doctrine alone the effects which I have supposed to arise only from the musical yet he clearly admits both the doctrines to be warranted from antiquity and I am glad to have so far the support of this learned critics opinion but of the connection between the two doctrines as I have explained it I see no trace in his notes nor is it to be imagined but that if he had seen it he would have enlarged upon it In respect to Dr Wallis though he had the ad vantage of the notes of Meibomius who had cleared up so many difficulties and had also taken under his own management the text of Ptolemey the author of all others the most likely to have given him a thorough insight into this subject yet we find him not only defective in his explanations of it but con trary to his usual accuracy even in misleading his readers by false doctrines With respect to the mu sical doctrine if we may judge by his silence he ap pears to have seen less of it than Meibomius for in the appendix to his edition of Ptolemey wherein he gia harmonia apud optimos autores legimus Deinde eaedem toni et tropi seu modi sunt adpellati Meibom in Euclid Introduct Harm p 42 41 Id est quae sit species octachordi seu quis tonus nam duo bus modis usurpatur vox  uno pro genere enarmonio al tero pro tono seu tropo seu modo quae significatio est huic loco propria Meibom in Arist Quint p 230 under763 undertakes to explain the harmonic elements after treating of the species of diapason he gives not the least hint that they had any relation to the modes except by giving their denominations and in doing this he expresses himself 42 as if he thought these denomi nations rather assigned for some separate reason than on account of their connection with the modes though as he was going immediately to the doctrine of the tones this was the place where he might have been expected to have taken notice of the connection between the two doctrines if he had observed it In treating of the modes indeed though he explains them on the foot of the harmonic doctrine only 43 he assigns some of his authors reasons for reducing them to seven 44 And his note also on the be ginning 42 Atque hae quidem diapason species septem sua singulae sortiebantur nomina prima dicta est Mixolydia secunda Lydia tertia

if it had struck him as an antient and genuine theory of the modes But it is plain to me that however he may have penetrated the sense of these particular passages he did not grasp their consequences This the mistakes he has fallen into sufficiently shew which I shall now proceed to point out and which a thorough comprehension of the subject could not but have prevented In speaking of the mese of the Hypophrygian mode he explains it by c instead of f  47 a mistake which I think must be imputed to his haste In the table of the modes which he has given from Meibomius 48 he has placed the letters in use with the moderns against the Hypodorian as well as the Dorian making A answer to the proslam banomenos of the former as well as the latter by which it is to be presumed he means them to express the absolute pitch of the sounds in the Dorian and in the Hypodorian to denote only the general rela tions of the system but this should have been far ther explained 47 Not ad Ptol p 154 lin 41 48 P 155 5 F 2 But766 But his greatest mistake and which I know not how to reconcile to his usual cation is in the me thod he gives for finding the places of the meses for the seven modes Not only is this method erroneous but he gives it expresly as the method of Ptolemey 49 though no such direction is to be found in his work As I have already given Ptolemeys method in our modern terms for the sake of brevity from his tenth chapter where it is delivered I shall here give that of Wallis in the same terms that the dif ference between the two may more easily be seen  First pitch the Dorian which is the middle tone suppose in A rise a fourth to D for the Mixolydian fall a fifth to G for the Hypolydian rise a fourth to C for the Lydian Then begin from the Dorian again and fall a fourth to E for the Hypodorian rise a fifth to B for the Phrygian and fall a fourth to F  for the Hypophrygian 50 By this method we see the meses of the Lydian and Hypolydian are brought out at c and f natural whereas by Ptolemeys they come out at c  and f  where I have placed them This mistake I apprehend the doctor was led into by the eleventh chapter of Ptolemeys second book where the meses of the Lydian and Hypo lydian are settled in trite diezeugmenon and lichanos meson which strings in their natural situation in the Dorian mode were tuned to c and g natural 49 Hanc autem methodum adhibet Ptolemaeus in tonis suis septem designandis c  primum omnium facit c secundo tonum sumit c App ad Ptol p 313  314 50 Ibid p 313 lin ult usque ad p 315 lin 20 but767 but in this chapter the author means only to fix the numerical string allotted for each mese without regard to its pitch which was to be regulated by the distances assigned for the tones in the tenth chapter And by these distances and all other con curring circumstances it is manifest that the two strings in question were in these modes to be made a semitone more acute than their natural situation as I have already observed in explaining the har monic doctrine How therefore the doctor could so far wander from the true theory which lay before him in the text of his authors tenth chapter as to substitute a different method and deliver it with great prolixity of explanation as the method of his author is what I know not how to account for much less reconcile to his accustomed care and fide lity What is still more extraordinary is that after finishing the directions and explanations of his own method he in the very next paragraph cites the very tenth chapter of Ptolemey where the method is given 51 in order to infer with his author that the Mixolydian tone was distant from the Lydian a hemitone the Lydian from the Phrygian a tone c though this inference which is true only from Ptolemeys method directly contradicts all he had been delivering Could he overlook the falseness of this inference whilst he was taking so much pains 51 His positis inde colligitur ut cap 10 toni Mixolydii a Lydio distantiam limma seu crassius loquendo hemitonium hujus a Phrygio tonum hujus a Dorio tonum Dorii ab Hypo lydio limma Hypolydii ab Hypophrygio tonum hujusque ab Hypodorio itidem tonum App p 315 lin 21 with768 with the subject But not to insist farther on the slips of a writer to whom the learned world stands so highly indebted I shall take leave of him with this remark only that whatever he may have seen of the truth of these doctrines himself his explanations have not succeeded in making the subject clear to succeeding writers those I have seen having either adopted the harmonic doctrine only or been so con founded between the two as to give a right account of neither This has in particular been the case with Malcolm who in his Treatise on Music ex plains that of the antients and has taken some pains to reconcile the two doctrines of the modes The greatest part of what this writer delivers is not only false in respect to the order positions and indeed almost every other circumstance attending the modes but at the same time scarce intelligible or if any meaning can be put upon it it is too foreign to the truth of either of the doctrines to be worth con sidering I shall content myself with citing a passage from him where his reasoning is the clearest and where we may see that after all the pains he has taken to reconcile the two doctrines he owns himself unable to make any sure decision upon the subject  He Ptolemey says in the beginning of that chapter cap 7 lib ii the mutations which are made by whole systems which we properly call tones because these differences consist in tension are infinite with respect to possibility as sounds are but actually and with respect to sense they are finite All this seems plainly to put the difference of the tones only in the acuteness or gravity of the whole else how do their differences consist in tension which signifies769 signifies a certain tenor or degree of tune and how can they be called infinite if they depend on the constitution of the octave Yet elsewhere he argues that they are no other than the species of octaves and as such makes their number seven and accordingly in all his schemes sets down their different modula tions But in chapter sixth he seems more plainly to take in both these differences for he says there are two principal differences with respect to the change of the tone one whereby the whole song is sung higher or lower the other wherein there is a change of the melody to another species than it was begun in but this he thinks is rather a change of the song or melos than of the tone as if again he would have us think this depended only on the acuteness and gravity of the whole So obscurely has the best of all the antient writers delivered him self on this article that deserved to have been most clearly handled But that I may have done with it I shall only say it must be taken in one or other of the senses mentioned if not in both for another I think cannot be found 52 Notwithstanding the confusion in this authors ex planations and his leaving the question thus unde cided it is his account of the modes that seems chiefly to have been adopted by compilers since And hence we find nothing better in the Cyclopaedia of Chambers or the Musical Dictionary of Grassi neau than a repetition of these doubts and perplexi ties Amongst the French writers Brossard in his Dictionaire de Musique throws no light upon this sub 52 Malcolms Treatise on Music p 538 lin ult 6 ject770 ject his account of the modes respecting chiefly those of much later times which were distinguished into plagal and authentic and with which the present question has very little concern Nor have I met with any thing satisfactory from their academicians though some of them appear to have taken great pains with the subject The writer amongst these who seems the most conversant with the music of the an antients is Monsieur Burette who in the Memoirs of literature has furnished many pieces on the va rious branches of the science Amongst others there is a dissertation of his on the melopaeia of the antient music which the learned academician should rather have intituled a dissertation on harmonic for it con tains an explanation of the elements of that science This author seems little apprized of the musical doc trine nor has he given a right account even of the harmonic one having followed Wallis in his mistake in respect to the method by which Ptolemey fixed the positions of his seven modes 53 and even drawn the same contradictory conclusion 54 53 Quainsi on devoit renfermer dans lespace dune octave

relied on the doctors ap pendix for this part at least of his explanations In his notes on the dialogue of Plutarch printed also in the same memoirs the not understanding the musical doctrine has led him into a very false explanation of the passage cited above concerning the invention of the Mixolydian mode He sets out 55 with ex cluding the only supposition that could lead him to the sense of his author by denying that the octa chord system could have any thing to do with this invention and then flies 56 to two other supposi tions viz that either the hendecachord or disdia pason was here meant both which are equally wide of the truth The public is much indebted to this writer for the laborious collections he has made in these notes concerning the antient musicians but his harmonic explanations are not always to be re lied on 55 Lamprocle nest point ici donne comme lauteur de lhar monie Mixolydienne il en est regarde seulement comme le re formateur Mais en quoi pouvoit consister

subject and with whose opinion I shall conclude these sheets is the anonymous author of a letter to Mr Avison concerning the music of the antients published with the essay of the latter on mufical ex pression in 1753 This author who professes but a slender knowlege of the theory either of modern or antient music has in a few pages discovered him self to be possessed of more than his modesty will permit him to lay claim to In the matter of the tones however such is the fatality that seems to have constantly attended this doctrine he does not appear to have succeeded better than the writers that have gone before him He blames Sanadon and Cerceau for affirming in their observations on Ho race carm 5 9 that the Dorian mode answered exactly to our Amila with a minor third and the Phrygian to our Amila with a major third Now that these French critics though right inasmuch as they seem to consider the modes as different species of diapason are nevertheless mistaken in their ap plication of them does indeed appear from my first diagram where it may be immediately seen that what they assert of the Dorian and Phrygian modes is true only of the Hypodorian and Lydian and had the anonymous writer gone no farther in his censure of them I should readily have joined with him but he rejects the musical doctrine entirely and admits only of the harmonic  Surely says he 57 speak ing of what these critics advance this is a musical error and a dream from the ivory gate Two modes 57 Page 6 with773 with the same tonic note the one neither acuter nor graver than the other make no part of the old system of modes And agreeably to this opinion he had before 58 described the seven modes as reducible to one mode taken higher or lower which he says may be be called the mode of A and must have had a minor third as c natural is a minor third to Amila Whether this be a just account of the nature of the modes I must now submit having said already what has occurred to me in support of the contrary opinion To conclude if what has been said should be thought to establish any certainty concerning this matter I should hope it might tend to revive an in quiry into the music of the antients which seems to have suffered an interruption from the difficulty of arriving at a right understanding of this material branch of it Such an inquiry may perhaps be judged well worth pursuing not only from the ad vantages which modern music might derive from it but also for the sake of improving the art of poetry and of better understanding and tasting the noble re mains we have of the antient poets the greatest beauties of whose works especially the lyric and dramatic are probably lost to us for want of seeing their connection with this science 58 Page 5 5 G 2 LXIX An

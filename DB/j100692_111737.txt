the Thermal Effects of Electric Currents in Unequally Heated Conductors ITheoretical considerations communicated in December 1851 to the Royal Society of Edinburgh founded on observations which had been made regarding the law of therinoelectric force in an un equally heated circuit of two metals led me to the conclusioln that ani electric current must exercise a convective effect on heat in a homogeneous metallic conductor of which different parts are kept at different temperatures A special application of the reasoning to the case of a coinpound circuit of copper and iron was made and it is repeated here because of the illustration it affords of the mecha inical principles on which the general reasoning is founded50 Becquerel discovered that if one junction of copper and iron in a circuit of the two metals be kept at an ordinary atmospheric tem perature while the other is raised gradually to a red or white heat a current first sets from copper to iron through the hot junction in creasing ini strength only as long as the temperature is below about 3000 Cent and becoming feebler with farther elevations of tempera ture until it ceases and a current actually sets in the contrary direc tion when a high red heat is attained Mlany experimenters have professed themselves unable to verify this extraordinary discovery but the description which M Becquerel gives of his experiments leaves no room for the doubts which some have thrown upon his conclusion and establishes the thermoelectric inversion between iron and copper not as a singular case extraordinary and unex pected as it appeared but as a phenomenon to be looked for be tween any two metals when tried through a suflicient range of tem perature especially any two which lie near one another in the thermoelectric series for ordinary temperatures M Regnault has verified M Becquerels conclusioni so far in findinLg that the strength of the current in a circuit of copper and iron wire did not increase sensibly for elevatiolns of temperature above 240 Cent and began to dimninish when the temperature considerably exceeded this limit but the actual inversion observed by M Becquerel is required to show that the diminution of strength in the current is due to a real falling off in the electromotive force and not to the increased resist ance known to be produced by an elevation of temperature From Becquerels discovery it follows that for temperatures be low a certain limit which for paricular specimnelis of copper and iron wire I have ascertained by a mode of experimenting described below to be 280 Cent copper is on the negative side of iron in the thermoelectric series and on the positive side for higher tempera tures and at the limiting temperature copper and iron are therno electrically neutral to one another It follows according to the general mechanical theory of thermoelectric currents referred to above that electricity passing firom copper to iron causes the absorp tion or the evolution of heat according as the tenmperature of the metals is below or above the neutral point but neither evolution xor absorption of heat if the temperature be precisely that of neu trality a conclusion wlhich I have already partially verified by51 experiment Hence if in a circuit of copper and iron one junction be kept about 2800 that is at the neutral temperature and the other at any lower temperature a thermoelectric current will set from copper to ironi through the hot and from iron to copper through the cold junction causing the evolution of heat at the latter and the raising of weights too if it be employed to work an electromag netic engine but not causing the absorption of any heat at the hot junction Hence there must be an absorption of heat at some part or arts of the circuit consisting solely of one metal or of the other to an amount equivalent to the heat evolved at the cold junction to gether with the thermal value of any mechanical effects produced in other parts of the circuit The locality of this absorption can only be where the temperatures of the single metals are nonuiniform since the thermal effect of a current in any homogeneous uniformly heated conductor is always an evolution of heat Hence there must be on the whole an absorption of heat caused by the current in passing from cold to hot in copper and from hot to cold in iron When a current is forced through the circuit against the thermo electric force the same reasoning establishes an evolution of heat to an amount equivalent to the sum of the heat that would be then taken in at the cold junction and the value in heat of the energy spent by the agency chemical or of any other kind by which the electromnotive force is applied The aggregate reversible thermal effect thus demonstrated to exist in the unequally heated portions of the two mnetals mnight be produced in one of the metals alone or as appears more natural to suppose it may be the sum or difference of effects experienced by the two Adopting as a matter of form the latter supposition without excluding the former possibility we may assert that either there is absorption of heat by the current passing from hot to cold in the copper and evolutioin to a less extent in the iron of the same circuit or there is absorption of heat produced by the current from hot to cold in the iron and evolution of heat to a less amount in the copper or there must be absorption of heat in each miietal with the reverse effect in each case when the current is reversed The reversible effect in a single metal of nonuniform temxlperature may be called a convectioni of heat anid to avoid cir cumlocution I shall express it that the vitreous electricity carries heat with it or that the specific heat of vitreous electricity is positivewheni this convection is in the nominal  direction of the current and I shall apply the same expressions to  resinous electricity  when the convection is against the nominal direction of the current It is established then that one or other of the following three hypo theses must be true Vitreous electricity carries heat with it in an urnequally heated conductor whether of copper or iron but more in copper than in iron Or Resinous electricity carries heat witih it irn an unequally heated conductor whether of copper or iron but more in iron than in copper Or Vitreous electricity carries heat with it in an unequally heated conductor of copper and Resinous electricity carries heat with it in an unequally heated colnductor of iron Immediately after communicating this theory to the Royal Society of Edinburgh I commenced trying to ascertain by experiment which of the three hypotheses is the truth as Theory with only thermo electric data could not decide between them I had a slight bias in favour of the first rather than the second in consequence of the positiveness which after Franklin we habitually attribute to the vitreous electricity and a very strong feeling of the improbability of the third With the able and persevering exertions of my assistant Mr McFarlane applied to the construction of various forms of ap paratus and to assist me in conducting experiments the research has been carried on with little intermission for more than two years Mr Robert Davidson Mr Charles A Smnith and other friends have also given much valuable assistance during the greater part of this time in the different experimental investigationls of which results are now laid before the Royal Society Only nu gatory results were obtained unltil recently from multiplied and varied experiments both on copper and iron conductors but the theoretical anticipation was of such a nature that no want of expe rimerntal evidence could influence my cotnvictioii of its truth About four months ago by means of a lnew form of apparatus I aseertained that resinous electricity carries heat with it in an uneqjually heated iron conductor A similar equally sensitive arranigemlent slhowed no re sult for copper The second hypothesis mnight then have been ex pected to hold but to ascertain the truth with certainty I have53 continued ever since getting an experiment on copper nearly every week with more and more sensitive arrangements and at last in two experiments I have made out with certainty that vitreous elec tricity carries heat with it in an unequally heated copper conductor The third hypothesis is thus established a most unexpected con clusion I am willing to confess I intend to continue the research and I hope not only to ascer tain the nature of the thermal effects in other metals but to deter mine its amount in absolute measure in the most important cases and to find how it varies if at all with the temperature that is to determine the character positive or negative and the value of the specific heat varying or not with the temperature of the unit of current electricity in various metals  IL On thte Law of Thermoelectric Force in an unequally heated circuit of two Metals A general relation between the specific heats of electricity in two different metals and the law of thermoelectric force in a circuit composed of them according to the temperatures of their junctions was established in the communication to the Royal Society of Edin burgh referred to above and was expressed by an equation which may now be simplified by the thermometric assumption J t PIJ p denoting Carnots function J Joules equivalent and t the tempe rature measured from an absolute zero about 2731o Cent below the freezingpoint since this assumption defines a system of thermometry in absolute measure which the experimental researches recently made by Mr Joule and myself establish as not differing sensibly from the scale of the airthermometer between ordinary limits The equa tion when so modified takes the following form F J SSTS1T dt where a denotes the excess of the specific heat of electricity in the metal through which the current goes from cold to hot above the specific heat of the same electricity in the other metal at the tem  See Proceedings RSE Dec 1851 or Philosophical Magazmine 185254 perature t F the thermoelectric force in the circuit when the two junctions are kept at the temperatures S and T respectively of which the former is the higher and OS the amount of heat absorbed per unit of electricity crossing the hot junction The following relation similarly simplified in form was also established 0 dO t dt These relations show how important it is towards the special ob ject of determining the specific heats of electricity in metals to in vestigate the law of electromotive force in various cases and to de termine the thermal effect of electricity in passing from one metal to another at various temperatures Both of these objects of researcl are therefore included in the general investigation of the subject The only progress I have as yet made in the lastmentioned branch of the inquiry has been to demonstrate experimentally that there is a cooling or heating effect produced by a current between copper and iron at an ordinary atmospheric temperature according as it passes from copper to iron or from iron to copper in verifica tion of a theoretical conclusion mentioned above but I intenid shortly to extend the yerification of theory to a demonstration that reverse effects take place between those metals at a temperlature above their neutral point of about 2800 Cent and I hope also to be able to make determiinations in absolute measure of the amount of the Peltier effect for a given strenigth of current between various pairs of metals With reference to laws of electromotive force in various cases I have commenced by determining the order of several specimens of mletals in the thermoelectric series and lhave ascertained some very curious facts regarding varieties in this series which exist at different temperatures In this I have only followed Becquerels remarkable discovery from whichI had been led to the reasoning and experimnental investigation regarding copper and iron described above My way of experimenting has been to raise the temperature first of one junction as far as the circumstances admit keeping the other cold and then to raise the temperature of the other gradually and watch the indications of a galvanometer during the whole process When an inversion of the current is noticed the changing temperature is00 brought back till the galvanometer shows no current and then by a process quite analogous to that followed by Mr Joule and Dr Lyon Playfair in ascertaining the temperature at which water is of maximum density the temperatures of the two junctions are ap proximated the galvanometer always being kept as near zero as possible When the difference between any two temperatures on each side of the neutral point which give no current is not very great their arithmetical mean will be the neutral temperature A regular deviation of the mean temperature from the true neutral tempera ture is to be looked for with wide ranges and a determination of it would show the law according to which the difference of the spe cific heat of electricity in the two metals varies with the tempera tures but I have not even as yet ascertained with certainty the ex istence of such a deviation in any particular case The following is a summary of the principal results I have already obtained in this department of the subject The metals tried beingthree platinum wires P1 the thickest P2 the thinnest and P3 one of intermediate thickiness brass wires B a lead wire L slips of sheet lead L copper wires C and iron wire I I find that the specimens experimented on stand thermoelectrically at different temperatures in the order shown in the following Table and explained in the heading by reference to bismuth and antimony or to the terms  negative  and  positive as often used Temp Bismuth Antimony Cent  Negative  Positive 20 P3 c P2  P1I 0 P3 1 P2 C P I 37 P3 b LP2 C P1  I 64 P3  P2 b 1 CP I 130 P 3 P BP1 L  C  I 140 P3 P2 PlBLC I 280 P 3 P2  P CI 300 P 3 P2 P b I CIt must be added by way of explanation that the bracket en closing the symbols of any two of the metallic specimens indicates that they are neutral to one another at the correspondirng temperature and the arrowhead below one of them shows the direction inD which it is changing its place with reference to the other in the series as the temperature is raised When there is any doubt as to a posi tion as shown in the Table the symbol of the metal is a small letter instead of a capital The rapidity with which copper changes its place among some of the other metals the platinums and iron is very remarkable Brass also changes its place in the same direction possibly no less rapidly than copper and lead changes its place also in the same direction but certainlv less rapidly thani brass which afteri passing the thick platinum wire PI at 130 Cent passes the lead at 1400 the lead itself having probably passed the thick platinum at some tempera ture a little below 1300 The conclusion as regards specific heats of electricity in the dif ferent metals from the equation expressing thermoelectric force given above is that the specific heat of vitreous electricity is greater in each metal passing aniother from left to right in the series as the temperature rises than in the metal it passes thus in particular The specific heat of vitreous electricity is greater in copper than in plcatinum or in iron greater in brass than in platinum or in lead and greater in lead than in platinum It is probable enough from the results regarding iron and copper mentioned above that the specific heat of vitreous electricity is positive in brass very small positive or else negative in platinum perhaps of about the same value as in iron It will not be difficult to test these speculations either by direct experiment on the convective effects of electric currents in the different metals or by comparative measurements of thermoelectric forces for various temperatures in circuits of the metals and I trust to be able to do so before long  III On Thermoelectricity in crystalline metals and in metals in a state of mechanical strain Having recently been occupied with an extension of the mechani  I have since found that it does pass the thick platinum at the temperatur e 11S May 16 18547 cal theory to the phenomena of thermoelectricity in crystalline metals I have been led to experimental investigation on this branch of the subject The difficulty of obtaining actual metallic crystals of considerable dimensions made it desirable to imitate crystalline structure in various ways The analogies of the crystalline optical properties which have been observed in transparent solids in a state of strain and of the crystalline structure as regards magnetic induc tion which Dr Tyndalls remarkable experiments show to be pro duced not only in bismuth but in wax thick paste of flour and  the pith of fresh rolls by pressure made it almost certain that pres sure or tension on a mass of metal would give it the thermoelectric properties of a crystal The only case which I have as yet had time to try verifies this anticipation I have found that copper wire stretehed by a weight bears to similar copper wire unstretched ex actly the thermoelectric relation which Svanberg discovered in a bar cut equatorially from a crystal of bismuth or antimony compared with a bar cut axially from a crystal of the same metal Thus I found that If part of a circuit of copper wire be stretched by a considerable force and the remainder left in its natural condition or stretched by a less force and if either extremity of the stretched part be heated a current sets from the stretched to the unstretched part through the hot junction and if the wire be stretched and unstretched on the two sides of the heated part alternately the current is reversed as far as I have been able yet to test instantaneously with each change the tension I intend to make similar experiments on other metallic wires also to try the effect of transverse as well as of longitudinal tension on slips of sheet metal with their ends at different temperatures when pilaced longitudinally in an electric circuit and the effects of oblique tension on slips of metal similarly placed in a circuit but kept with their ends at the same temperature and their lateral edges unequally heated I have no doubt of being able so to verify every thermo electric characteristic of crystalline structure in metals in a state of strain Glasgow College March 30 1854 PS April 19 1854I have today found by experiment that iron VOL VII G58 wire when stretched by a considerable force bears a thermoelectric relation to unstretched iron wire the opposite of that which I had previously discovered in the case of copper wire and I have ascer tained that when the wire is alternately stretched and unstretched on the two sides of a heated part the current is reversed along with the change of tension always passing from the unstretched to the stretched part through the hot locality I hope before the end of the present Session to have a complete account of all the experiments of which the results are stated above ready to communicate to the Royal Society

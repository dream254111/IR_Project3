HOLD NOR WAS IT HELD IN THAT EASE THAT THE FILING OF SUCH A BILL OF EXCEPTION A WHOLLY UNNECESSARY ACT AND A PRACTICE WHICH SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED BECAUSE IT UNNECESSARILY INCUMBERS THE RECORD AND ADDS TO THE COST OF COPYING AND PRINTING IT WOULD PREVENT THIS COURT FROM REVIEWING THE RULING OF THE COURT UPON THE DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE THE ERRORS ASSIGNED ARE 1 THAT THE EVIDENCE CONSIDERED AS ON A DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE DOES NOT SHOW THAT THE PLAINTIFFS INJURIES WERE THE RESULT OF THE DEFENDANTS NEGLIGENCE AND 2 EVEN IF THEY WERE THE PLAINTIFF WAS GUILTY OF CONTRIBULTORY NEGLIGENCE IT

OF THE WAY OF THE YARD ENGINE THAT AS HE TURNED AROUND AND ATTEMPTED TO JUMP ACROSS THE TRACK ONTO THE STATION PLATFORM THE YARD ENGINE STRUCK HIM THAT HE WAS WORKING UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE FORE MAN OF INSPECTORS THAT IN INSPECTING TRAINS HE STOOD ABOUT THE SECOND RAIL FROM THE DEPOT PORCH WHICH WAS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS HE COULD GET AND LOOK UNDER THE PASSENGER COACHES AND BE OUT OF DAN GER FROM RODS OR OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN AND HANGING DOWN OR OUT FROM THE PASSING TRAIN AND THAT THIS WAS THE PROPER PLACE TO STAND AS HE UNDERSTOOD FROM HIS INSTRUCTIONS TWO OF THE PLAINTIFFS

DANGER FROM TRAINS PASSING ON THAT TRACK ONE OF THESE WITNESSES TESTIFIED THAT HE WAS STANDING ON THE STATION OR DEPOT PLATFORM THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT THAT WHEN HE FIRST SAW THE PLAINTIFF HE WAS STANDING ON THE TRACK WITH HIS WRENCH AND HAMMER IN ONE HAND AND HIS TORCH IN THE OTHER INSPECTING THE CARS AND WHEN THE ENGINE AND ABOUT FOUR COACHES HAD PASSED HIM SOME ONE HALLOOED AT HIM AND AS HE

THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TRAIN FROM WHERE HE WAS INJURED THAT THERE WAS NO NECESSITY IN INSPECTING THE TRAIN FOR HIM TO GO UPON THE TRACK OR INTO A PLACE OF DANGER THAT HIS FIRST DUTY WAS TO LOOK OUT FOR HIS OWN SAFETY AS SWITCH ENGINES MAY BE EXPECTED AT ANY TIME ON THE YARD THAT THE PLAINTIFF STEPPED UPON THE TRACK 10 OR 15 FEET AHEAD OF THE YARD ENGINE RUNNING AT THE RATE OF 8 OR 10 MILES AN

defendant brings error Affirmed R L Parrish  Son for plaintiff in error F W King for defendant in error BUCHANAN J George A Pierce the plaintiff in the court below was employed by the Chesapeake  Ohio Railway Company as a car inspector at Clifton Forge and while so engaged was run upon and injured by a switch engine Upon the first trial there was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff634 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Nov which the court set aside upon motion of the defendant company At the next trial the defendant company demurred to the evidence which was the same as on the former trial The court a different judge presiding overruled the demurrer and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the damages found by the jury in their conditional verdict and to that judgment this writ of error was awarded IJpon the threshold of the case it is suggested by the plaintiff that the defendant company has made the demurrer to evidence a part of the record by a bill of exceptions and that this eannot be done under the decision of the court in the ease of C  0 ly Co v Sparrows Admr 98 Va 630 37 S E 302 That case did decide that no bill of exceptions to the ruling of the court on a demurrer to evidence was necessary to enable this court to review such ruling because a demurrer to evidence like a demurrer to a pleading filed in the cause is a part of the record But it was not intended to hold nor was it held in that ease that the filing of such a bill of exception a wholly unnecessary act and a practice which should not be permitted because it unnecessarily incumbers the record and adds to the cost of copying and printing it would prevent this court from reviewing the ruling of the court upon the demurrer to the evidence The errors assigned are 1 that the evidence considered as on a demurrer to evidence does not show that the plaintiffs injuries were the result of the defendants negligence and 2 even if they were the plaintiff was guilty of contribuLtory negligence It appears that the plaintiff was one of two employes of the de fendant company whose duty was to inspect all passenger trains stopping at Clifton Forge where there is a passenger station and a platform attached about 600 feet long a number of switches and two main tracks The platform is made of plank two or three inches thick laid between and on either side of the rails on the inain tracks and extending from the station across both Westbound trains pass over the track nearest the station and easthound trains pass over the other The distance between the tracks is 13 feet fromni the center of one to the center of the other and between Pull mlan coaches on passing trains about 3 feet It was the duty of the inspectors to be on opposite sides of the trains as they came into the station and in such position that they could from sight and1904 C  0 RY CO V PIERCE 635 sound ascertain whether any part ot the cars was loose and drag ging or whether any of the wheels were flattened and after the cars came in to go closer to the cars and inspect them One of the rules of the defendant company was that a train must not pass between a station building and a passenger train en gaged in taking on or letting off passengers until signaled ahead On the night of the accident just before midnight as an east bound passenger train about 300 feet long was approaching the station the plaintiff and the other inspector who were standing near the baggage room after the arrival of the train had been an nounced started together in the direction from which the train was coming to perform their duties The plaintiff whose mental fac ulties were impaired by the injuries complained of does not give a very intelligible account of the accident His evidence tends to prove that as the passenger train came in he looked in both direc tions for engines on the westbound track and seeing none he stepped upon or across that track and was engaged in his work of inspection when some one hallooed to him to get out of the way of the yard engine that as he turned around and attempted to jump across the track onto the station platform the yard engine struck him that he was working under the instructions of the fore man of inspectors that in inspecting trains he stood about the second rail from the depot porch which was about as close as he could get and look under the passenger coaches and be out of dan ger from rods or other things that might be broken and hanging down or out from the passing train and that this was the proper place to stand as he understood from his instructions Two of the plaintiffs witnesses testified that the uisual place for ear inspectors to stand when inspecting eastbound trains was on or near the inner rail of the westbound track and that when in that position they were in danger from trains passing on that track One of these witnesses testified that he was standing on the station or depot platform the night of the accident that when he first saw the plaintiff he was standing on the track with his wrench and hammer in one hand and his torch in the other inspecting the cars and when the engine and about four coaches had passed him some one hallooed at him and as he faced the depot the yard engine came by striking and dragging him to the upper end of the platform636 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Nov that the yard engine was running backward at the rate as he thought of from 12 to 15 miles an hour Another of his witnesses testified that the engine was running at least 15 miles an hour The expressman had his trucks on the westbound track at the east end of the platform between the point where the plaintiff was injured and the point from which the engine came which had to be removed before the engine could pass The switch engine and the passenger engine met about miJway of the station platform the latter running about 4 miles an hour making considerable noise and the former according to the plaintiffs evidence from 1V2 to 15 miles tn hour There was evidence that it was usual for pas sengers employes and other persons to collect and stand upon the platform across the westbound track when passenger trains were arriving stopping or standing at the station and that it was not usual to run yard engines over the westbound track when there was a passenger train on the other track and that when it was done some one went ahead of the engine to get people out of the way that the yard engine ran about 75 or 100 yards after the plaintiff was seen on the track inspecting the cars that the engi neer could have seen him if he had looked and that the engine could have been stopped in about two lengths with the emergency brakes running as it was The evidence of the defendant company tended to prove that the plaintiffs position for inspection was on the opposite side of the train from where he was injured that there was no necessity in inspecting the train for him to go upon the track or into a place of danger that his first duty was to look out for his own safety as switch engines may be expected at any time on the yard that the plaintiff stepped upon the track 10 or 15 feet ahead of the yard engine running at the rate of 8 or 10 miles an hour that it was not running in violation olf any rule of the company that its bell was ringing from the time it started until the accident occurred and that a lookout ahead was kept Upon all the evidence in the case the jury might have believed that the defendant company was running its yard engine at the time of the accident if not in violation of its rule at least in vio lation of the usual manner in which it ran it and gave warning of its approach on that track when a passenger train was on the other1904 HAWPE V BUXGARDNER 637 track that the plaintiff was at the usual and proper place for in specting cars having no reason to expect that a yard engine would be running on the track at that time and that his danger could have been seen and the accident avoided if the employes on the engine had been performing their duty and could have found in favor of the plaintiff upon the questions of negligence and contrib utory negligence And since the jury might have found for the plaintiff on these questions the court upon the defendants demur rer to evidence must so find Bass Admr v Norfolk Ry Co 100 Va 1 40 S E 100 We are therefore of opinion that the circuit court did not err in overruling the demurrer to the evidence and that its judgment must be affirmed Affirmed NOTEIn Southern Railway v Cooper 98 Va 299 302 it is said  Under our practice the only mode of taking away from the jury the determination of the weight to be given to evidence is by demurring to it The rule applicable to a demurrer to evidence is The demurrant admits the truth of his adversarys evidence and all just inferences which the jury could have properly drawn therefrom and waives all of his own evidence in conflict therewith and all inferences from his own evidence although not in con flict therewith which do not necessarily result therefrom Watts v Southern Bell Telephone o 100 Va 4547 University of Virginia v Snyder 100 Va 567 577 Johnson v C  0 Ry CO 91 Va 171 and authorities cited G

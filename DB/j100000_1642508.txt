papers were presented by invitation Radiation and Atomic Structure Presidential address before the American Physical Society R A Millikan The Atom and Chemical Valence G N Lewis Molecular Resonance and Atomic Structure Robert W Wood The Evolution of the Elements as Related to the Structure of the Nuclei of Atoms Wm D Har kins The Relation of Magnetism to the Structure of the Atom Wm J Humphreys The Relations of Magnetism to Molecular Struc ture Albert P Wills The Structure of Solids and Liquids and the Nature of Interatomic Forces Irving Langmuir Electromerism A Case of Chemical Isomerism Resulting from a Difference in Distribution of Valence Atoms Lauder W Jones The following responded to invitations to dis cuss the papers Wm Duane A C Crehore and K G Falk Mr Falk read the discussion of J M Nelson The discussion was then thrown open and participated in by W F G Swann A G Webster M I Pupin and others Many physicists attended the addresses Tuesday evening of the retiring president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Di rector W W Campbell of the Lick Observatory on The Nebulhe and the special program of Section D Friday evening on  The Interrelation ship of Engineering and Pure Science This ses sion was held at the Engineering Societies Build ing and was followed by a reception to visiting members of the A A A S At a short business session the result of the mail ballot for the election of officers was an nounced R A Millikan H A Bumstead A D Cole and J S Ames was reelected president vice president secretary and treasurer respectively H A Wilson and G 0 Squier are the new members of the council F Bedell is reelected managing editor and 0 M Stewart N E Dorsey and Wm Duane are elected on the editorial board of the Physical Review The reports of the treasurer and the man aging editor were presented and on motion ac cepted These will be printed and mailed to all members It was announced that the next meet ing of the society would probably be in connection with the Midwinter Convention of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers at New York February 1416 The subscription dinner on Thursday evening was attended by about eighty and was much enjoyed The exhibit of new apparatus and results in the Commons Building was open from 4 to 6 PM daily and on Friday afternoon the instruction and research laboratories for physics in Fayerweather Hall were on exhibition with members of the teach ing staff in attendance For these courtesies and many others the society is indebted to Director Geo B Pegram who also had charge of the phys ics portion of the apparatus exhibit The attendance at this meeting was recordma king about 325 at the joint sessions on Wednes day and about 200 at most of the ordinary ses sions The number of new members elected at the meeting was forty which also probably estab lishes a new record A D COLE Secretary

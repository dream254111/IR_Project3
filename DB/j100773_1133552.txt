j100773,Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology,1133552,Some Principles of Parole Laws for Girls,i247497,SOME PRINCIPLES OF PAROLE LAWS FOR GIRLS EDITH N BURLEIGH2 Unless parole is considered in its relation to a state program for the correction of delinquency no true estimate of its value can be made Penology should deal with correctional systems and should recog nize the various phases of treatment as parts of one whole preserving the relations of one part to another and the interdependence of the parts The following paper attempts to indicate the place of parole in the care of the delinquent girl and some of its principles We are considering girls who have been committed to the insti tution by the court because of having broken certain laws or statutes We are not talking about dependent or neglected children who in cer tain states are being put into industrial schools We are also assuming that the institution has been established as a training school on the cottage plan which means a certain free life as contrasted with the stricter discipline which goes with the high walls of reformatory institutions It is because the girl could not adjust herself was a misfit in the community that she was sent to the institution Parole is the process of reeducationthe specific kind of community service through which the girl is reabsorbed into free community life The difference between parole and probation is that parole is deal ing with a girl who has been removed entirely from the community and subject to all the influences of institution life while probation undertakes readjustment without this experience No girl of average mentality could pass unchanged through a period of enforced retire ment in an institution because so many new forces have been brought to bear upon her It is the purpose of this paper then to discuss by what methods parole can best accomplish its end establishment of the girl in free community life as a helpful force Its conclusions are based on experience with girls only and may differ materially from the principles applicable to the parole of boys and of adults Reabsorption into the community is governed in each instance by widely differing considerations Read at the National Conference of Social Work Kansas City Mav 1918 2Superintendent Girls Parole Department Trustees of Massachusetts Training Schools Boston396 EDITH N BURLEIGH The normal boy for illstance has anl economic value and an inter est in his own economic efficiency Such interest is secondary in im portance with the girlat least in her own mind Earning her living presents itself to her in a form which offers none of the inducements of a career and is but a necessary tiding over of the time until she shall marry and have a home of her owna frankly avowed ambition with a majority of these girls This difference in mental attitude must have a great bearing in determining methods of parole and methods should be appliedprinciples The fact that parole should be a part of any correctional system will undoubtedly be accepted It is conceded by some of the most progressive institution super fntendents that parole is of importance equal to that of the institu tion Their reason for this rather radical stand is that the institution because of its restricted and practically homogeneous group cannot hope to complete the girls training since it can offer no practical ap plication of the knowledge gained in her industrial training nor test the sincerity of her change of heart and the strength of her good resolutions when the girl is called upon to face the temptations of normal community life The institution then is only the first step along the road to the complete rehabilitation of the girl As the unrestricted return of the girl to the community is mani festly too dangerous both for society and for the girl a second step must be provided for in the state program which shall include con tinued training and supervision The return of the girl to the com munity under these conditions is imiade possible by a system of parole There are several theories as to the best system Most institutiolns have a parole officer perhaps several officers belonging to the staff where possible living in the institution and usually having some duties in the institution itself These parole officers are under the direction of the superintendent of the institution This systenm has leen upheld on the ground that the girl was best known to and therefore best handled by a person living with her in the institution A theory more recently advocated is that parole and probation should be coordinlated and that when the girl is paroled from the in stitution she should b1e retturned to the jurisdiction of the court which conilllitte lier as otherwise tlle knowledge of her gained through the investigation for the court would not be availablePAROLE FOR GIRLS 397 The real test for any theory of parole is how effectively it can accomplish its objectthe complete restoration of the girl A parole system established as an independent outside depart ment under the same board of trustees would seem to be the most effective means of solving the problem While under certain conditions parole might be well done under the direction of the superintendent of the institution separation from it insures a more complete identification of the girl with the com munity from the start It marks for her the second step in her progress towards freedom The possibilities of parole are so great that the work needs most careful organization and the undivided attention of its officers They should not be hampered or distracted by the problems of the institu tion since their work demands a constant study of the resources in the community which can be utilized for the development of the girl on parole This study can be made best by people who are themselves a part of the community Parole should offer the girl a chance to put behind her all the signs of her delinquencycourt probation institutionthe strongest argu ment against the coordination of probation and parole This need imply no disloyalty to the institution which has done so much for her but hitches up the girl more completely to the community from the beginning of her parole She must not fly back to the institution as a refuge from the difficulties or the temptations she meets She must learn how to fight them in the open with the resources which are available to her there This encouragement of independence of the institution does not preclude the return of girls to it when necessary for thie protection of the girl and of the community In certain instances the girls need the discipline of the institution sometimes they need medical treatment or further training to make them capable of earning their living It is fundamentally bad for the girl to make the reformatory in stitution a home center It should be a background for future attain ment instead With every desire to give the girl a sense that she has a home tying her to the institution unwittingly helps to prevent her from making new and more normal ties in the community I believe this would hold true also of any plan which held the girls together in a group anywhere outside the institution such as a home from which the girls went out to work in factories or stores Any such group even though in a lesser degree continues the abnormal segregation of PAROLE FOR GIRLS 397398 EDITH N I3URLELGH the institution and lessens the chances of the complete readjustment of the girl in society The continuance of associations formed in the institution with girls of lower standards than those acceptable to the community tends to lessen in the girls eyes the seriousness of the offense she had com mitted It is only after she comes out on parole that she can make her first application of the principles of right living taught her in the school It is then she realizes that if she does things other people condemni she cannot hope to win their respect or to nmaintain her own selfrespect The stimulating mental effect upon the girl of marking her for ward progress by this separation of institution and parole is evident because it offers her a new allegiance a new loyalty new influences a chance to begin all over again with new people and under entirely new conditions where old failures need not be recalled As in most instances her own home does not offer the best oppor tunities for her development it is usually necessary to secure for the girl a home in a family very carefully selected to fit her special needs a home which will give her in an unusual degree oversight protection and opportunities for further training In every instance the girls temperament and capacities must be considered It would be disastrous to place a slowmoving slowthinking girl with a quick redhaired woman the discouragements of both would be too great or again to give a chronic runaway a place with unrestricted chance to slip away from the womans notice This leads us to the conclusion that certain working principles certain methods are essential to successful parole These working prin ciples interlock but can be differentiated The first of these is individual treatment based on knowledge of the individual Each girl is an individual problem and her mental attitude as well as her capacities must be considered The school has been teaching her the fundamentals of good con duct truthfulness honesty clean thinking as well as giving her indus trial training supplementing her school education and laying the foun dation of habits of selfcontrol cleanliness order and industry The girls attitude towards her parole depends upon how much holdhow much formative powerthe institution has acquired over her She may be determined to begin over again her success depend ing only on her strenth of will or she may look upon parole as an opportunity to have her own way to be free or she may dread it as 398 EDITH N BURLEIGHPAROLE FOR GIRLS 399 she has grown dependent on the institution A more or less childish attitude seems to be a frequent result of group treatment It is the responsibility of any parole system to comprehend and meet any of these attitudes No treatment of the individual can be intelligent which is not based on a thorough knowledge of that individual her heredity her environment her companions her reactions to school her recreation her health her characteristics and disposition and her delinquencies prior to her commitment A thorough investigation of the girls back ground should be made as soon as possible after commitment in order that the institution can do its work intelligently and prepare the girl for parole The information thus gained is also of great value when the girl comes out on parole A person is her potentialities not what she is but what she may be plus her experiences The girl who has had institution treat ment is different from a girl who has never had it and different from what she would have been if she had never had it because it is an added layer of experience So it is necessary to add to what has been learned about the girl prior to her commitment her reactions to the institution These may be learned from reports from the various people who have come in contact with her in the school They should cover as many sides as possible While it may be easier for the girl to know her visitor before she comes out on parole there are real advantages in making a fresh start It adds to the adventure Such appeals to the imagination of the girl are real helps in arresting her attention and catching her interest at the beginning This individual treatment can only be secured by ozversight over every girlthe second working principle It is through constant oversight that the girls development is noted and her best interests insured This oversight is secured by means of visitors each visitor responsible for a certain number of girls who look to her for sympathy and guidance This oversight means also the protection of the girlthe third working principle Protection includes both the girl and the communityprotection of the girl from temptation by placing her in an environment which will stimulate her good impulses at the same time that it attracts and interests her Oversight over the girl may protect her from exploita tion through overwork or neglect of her health or happiness The protection of the girl from her bad impulses protects both the girl and the community400 EDiTH N BURLEIGH The fourth working principle education or reeducation is one of the most important To make oversight and protection possible the girls when they first come from the institution need to be placed at housework There are several reasons for thisthe chief reasons are because it is only at housework that they can be constantly supervised and protected and because having come from bad or weak homes they need to learn the essentials of a good happy wellordered home as most of them will become homemakers themselves There is a third reason for this placing of girls in families a good employer who is willing to interest herself in the further training and welfare of the girl is a powerful means of regeneration If the girl learns to love and respect the woman she lives with and works with she learns lessons in right living the value of which cannot be overestimated It may take several trials before a girl is fitted into the home best suited to influence her but the final result is worth the most patient searching Return to her own home may be educative if it is made under the right circumstances Either the home should offer special constructive influences or the girl should have developed sufficient character to grow through the responsibility of raising the standards of her home Ideally constructive study of the family of the girl should be made while the girl is in the care of the state How can new forces be set to work to build up a new family life and thus bring about a safe reuniting of girl and family The girls church connections may be a great influence in her re habilitation While many of the girls have not developed any real religious feeling they get in the habit of forming their social contacts through the church Some girls are honestly and deeply religious A true spiritual awakening is always possible and is always most hope ful Recreation means to most of the girls before they come to the school the commercialized recreation of the movies and the dance halls They know nothing of the wholesome pleasures of purely social inter course The goodwill aroused in the giveandtake of happy family sharing of good times the generous impulses awakened and the quick ened intellectual response resulting from social contacts of the right sort contribute largely to the growth of the girls character It is usually possible to gratify a girls ambition for lessons in music in school branches or in various other things in which she is interested either through private lessons or through the public schools where under wise oversight a girl who has failed utterly before com 400 EDITH N BURLEIGHPAROLE FOR GIRLS mitment because of bad influences may be reabsorbed into the school population and become a normal happy unit of it The establishment of the habit of thrift is another source of edu cation and is most important for the welfare of the girl and of the state It is only through thrifty habits that the girl can be selfsup porting when she has to stand upon her own feet after she passes out of the care of the state The girl must be taught frugality which is the basis of prosperityrespect both for the uses and the values of things If you can show the girl that frugalitv has associated with it the joy of achievement she will find real pleasure and pride in making over her dresses and retrimming her hats The attractiveness of planning is a wedge between the girl and the temptation of pretty clothes which can otherwise be hers only through illicit means As far as possible the girl should be selfsupporting from the start Selfsupport and selfrespect are closely allied A girl who feels that whatever the state does for her is no more than her due that having been com mitted to the school against her will the state should support her must be taught to realize that this is not the attitude of selfrespecting people Her growing independence may well give her a new vision of her rela tions to others The fifth working principle is closely linked to all the others and is the care of the girls health A parole system has no greater re sponsibility than this Many of these girls are physically in poor condition if they are not diseased at the time of their commitment They make surprising gains because of the regular life and the medical care of the institu tion but the neglect some of them have previously experienced the natural delicacy of others as well as the normal possibilities of illness make the solution of medical problems a very important part of the work of parole The most difficult of these is that of the girls suffer ing from venereal disease In spite of apparent cure after long treat ment in the institution the possibility of later developments in such cases make extra care in placing and constant watchfulness a neces sity The precaution of putting these girls immediately under skilled medical supervision as soon as they are paroled protects the com munity and insures the continued good health of the girl Among the working principles of parole never to be lost sight of is the long look ahead Good parole work implies much more than watchful care on the part of the officer What is the girl going to be and to do after she passes out of the care of the state From the beginning this should be borne in mind Nothing should be done with 4010 N the girl which does not look to her future What does she need most to hold her steadily to her purpose of being a good citizen after she has formed that purpose  She must have the constant and sympathetic encouragement of her visitor She must be given hope and the incen tive of a gratified ambition if she has one within the bounds of good sense and earning her living The plan for her future must be her plan or she will abandon it when she is free Even if you make a much wiser plan for her unless you can win her honest acceptance of your plan it must be given up for hers I he best you can do then is to give her a chance to test her own out before she passes out of your care One of the lessons parole officers have to remember is that the girl has to learn from her own experience sometimes from her own mistakes to make her choice wisely The learning of this lesson is worth the risk of many failures This long look ahead is much complicated by the variety and diffi culty of the problems presented by the girls No thoughtful prog nosis of the girls future can be made without careful observation of her mental development Not so long ago most girls who behaved badly who yielded to every impulse or who were swayed this way or that by their emotions were called feeblemnidedthat happy dumping ground of the social worker The psychiatrists and psycholo gists in their increasing comprehension of these problems though they have not yet determined upon treatment have taught us the value of careful diagnosis and in some instances are able to advise methods of care We at least have learned that sometimes apparently wilful conduct the girl herself is unable to control that intellect is not always the factor which gives most trouble in the mental makeup of the indi vidual A girl with average intellectual capacity may have no emo tional control or may be the victim of her own impulses The most hopeful feature is that this greater comprehension this combination of the experience of medical and social specialists may eventually be able to prove to legislative bodies that there are certain individuals who are not feebleminded nor insane but who are equally dangerous to the public welfare and who must be placed in custodial care In the present overcrowded conditions of the institutions for the feeble minded and the lack of institutions for the care of these even more difficult girls which include the defective delinquent and the more dangerous of the psychopathic personalities the future of these girls can be easily predicted but not prevented Then there are the girls who present problems of character and disposition the highstrung girls with bad tempers many of whom can 402 EDITH N BURLEIGHPAROLE FOR GiRLS 443 learn selfcontrol the suggestible girls swung either way by the people last with them the girls with babies the girls who steal the girl who is unchaste the girl with a grouch who believes the world will only give her what she demands And we must never forget that any one of them may be all of them What is the test of successful parole The girl herself We cannot measure success in exact terms nor can we analyze the rela tive importance of the elements which compose itthe unexpected re sponses the sudden awakening of unsuspected powers the new loyal ties the development of the child into the woman Nobody can stand ardize the parts of a human character nor assemble them but by the grace of God they grow while we stand by opportunists in character building ready to encourage or to restrain to sympathize with the joys and the sorrows and most earnestly endeavoring to understand If the community would recognize its own handiwork and its own job parole would not only be a larger part of its plan for the correction of delinquency but would be an accepted field of study for preventive measuresmeasures which could be taken with little children before they become delinquents For the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a bet ter hope PAROLE FOR GIRLS 403

ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY A Program for Redistributing Sources of Revenue as between Cities States and National Government By JAMES E BOYLE PHD Professor of Rural Economy Cornell University N this reconstruction period follow ing the World War there are certain to be important changes in our financial systems It is earnestly to be hoped that whatever the changes may be they will represent movement towards rather than away from a theoretically ideal system But in any event the best we can expect is a com promise between the desirable and the attainable The future historian of our present tax system and its changes will probably be able to reduce his out line to three main heads as follows 1 Right Principles abstract jus tice 2 The Expedient administrative standpoint 3 Compromise of the First and Second program of taxation 1 THE IDEAL SYSTEM It is quite generally agreed that jus tice requires that the true basis of taxa tion should be the ability to pay In carrying out this ideal scheme literally no income should be exempt from taxation This carries with it of course the further consideration that there should be no taxexempt secu rities To carry this important princi ple into practice would involve an amendment to the fundamental law of our land The foregoing considerations are based on abstract justice The ideal system from the administrative stand point is the most simple system In short to carry out to its logical con clusion the ideal system here we are forced to come to the three forms of taxes namely land income and inher itance Tax administrators tell us that a little almost trivial device may mean the difference between failure and suc cess of a tax so vital is the administra tive contact problem Hence in any scheme of taxation we ought to aim at making our tax business conform to our orderly and wellestablished business methods This means in our ideal system that a person should have presented to him one tax bill each year covering all his taxes for all pur poses for all jurisdictionsfederal state and local One check should settle this bill if the person so desired or suitable terms of payment twice or three times a year might be allowed since this is not so important The important thing is for the taxpayer to know definitely what the amount of his tax payment is to be and to know in detail for what purposes it is to be used The contrast between the methods of paying the tax bill in some of our old eastern states and some of our newer states is so striking as to be worth illus trating A tax officer from New York State was recently investigating fiscal matters in a middle western state In his home state it was his custom to receive many separate tax bills during the year for various jurisdictions and for different purposes He found the middle western taxpayer receiving one itemized bill covering state county city and school taxes with the definite amount specified for each jurisdiction Onehalf of this bill was due January 1 to March 1 that is any time during two months One check would settle half the bill or the whole bill or the second half of the bill could be paid byREDISTRIBUTING SOURCES OF REVENUE 273 July 1 The time will ultimately come when the taxpayer will receive one tax bill for a definite amount cover ing his federal state and city taxes One tax bill and one check will pay it This is an orderly business method 2 THE EXPEDIENT The first test any tax must meet is this one Can it be administered and will it be administered with a maxi mum of result and a minimum of effort This concrete problem of ad ministration takes precedence of the problem of a proper source of revenue now that the Federal Government is committedand doubtless perma nently committedto taxing incomes inheritances and corporations There no longer remain any sacred fields of taxation for the states We may look forward with some confidence to the time when every state will also be taxing incomes and inheritances cor porations of course they already attempt to tax Anticipating for the moment our discussion of the sources of revenue let us consider two ex pedients now palpably and indispu tably necessary in administering fed eral and state taxes cobperation and decentralization Coiperation The program of seg regation and separation in federal and state tax administration is no longer workable It is a violation of common sense that the two jurisdic tions should go on working with disre gard for the others needs or methods If the same property is to be taxed by the two jurisdictions the nation and the state then one valuation of that property is enough Of course the common sense of the administrators in charge of the federal income tax and the state income tax in such states as Wisconsin and New York for instance has already led to a considerable degree of voluntary coIperation As one fed eral administrator remarked referring to income and inheritance taxes The fact or set of facts which in the last two or three months I think has been borne home to me most keenly at Washington is the increasing degree in which the tasks of the Federal Governmentthe federal officialand those of the state official are alike common identical Continuing this thought the same official said in substance that it is ex pensive and extravagant for the Federal Government to be conducting a big administrative tax machine and for the state and local governments also to be doing it one walking in the tracks of the other and not very closely scruti nizing the tracks of the other There should be some sort of co6peration Decentralization The Treasury De partment at Washington is too far removed from the taxpayer to admin ister successfully the income tax and the inheritance tax The remedy for this defect is to decentralize this ad ministrative work to such an extent that there would be in effect a joint administration of these two taxes with the state governments interested Coiperation and decentralization should be carried to the limit dictated by efficiency and that limit is appar ently joint administration of these common taxes joint collection of the taxes and a division of the proceeds Such a program would cure two very outrageous evils in our present sys tem namely the shifting of residence evil to avoid certain taxes and the double taxation evil It is putting it mildly to speak of double taxation under our present system since certain property not only may be but fre quently is legally taxed four times in one year 3 THE COMPROMISE The brief suggestions above on the administrative problems emphasize 19274 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY purposely the importance of a tax system that will work out fairly well in practice I want to insert here in the way of an obiter dictum my hearty disapproval of any painless system of taxationof any plucking of the goose with the least squawk Tax payers will never take a proper interest in economy and efficiency in public expenditures until they feel the cost of such extravagance Never will they take more than a languid interest in our customary governmental waste and extravagance till they feel some drain on their own pocketbooks Assuming that the federal tax burden for this year will be approximately 6000000000 and for next year 4000000000 we have a per capita federal tax of substantially 60 this year and 40 next year This sum makes the federal tax burden heavier to the average taxpayer than his combined city and state tax It is appropriate therefore to consider first the sources of federal revenue SOURCES OF FEDERAL REVENUE 1 Income tax The income tax should come first as a source of federal revenue It should apply to all in comes of 1000 and over It should be a graduated tax The present in come tax rates should be readjusted in the higher brackets For administra tive reasons fifty per cent seems to be a high enough limit on the larger incomes instead of the present rate of seventy per cent or over States with an income tax should have the power of adding on their tax to the federal income tax In this manner one reporting and one collec tion a joint affair between state and federal government would serve the purpose There should be distributed back to the state its own share of the tax 2 Corporation tax excess profits tax The corporation tax is a going concern and should be kept as a federal tax but as in the case of the income tax certain readjustments are desirable The excess profits tax while it has a beguiling name is a thoroughly dis credited tax from the administrative standpoint and should be permanently discontinued To compensate in part for the loss of revenue thereby occa sioned an increase should be made in the corporation tax A flat rate of fifteen per cent seems to be the proper size for the corporation tax By applying the income tax at a low rate to incomes as low as 1000 an in crease in the yield from this tax would further compensate for the loss of the excess profits tax The corporation tax is used in one form or another by all the states Federal and state taxes on corporations should be jointly administered The state should keep the larger share of this tax 3 Inheritance tax Only a few years ago the National Tax Associa tion made a gallant fight to have the Federal Government keep its hands off the inheritance tax but failed Now most tax students are fully reconciled to having the Federal Government em ploy this form of taxation Indeed many are converted to the view that this tax is peculiarly wellsuited to federal administration owing to the ease with which residence can be shifted But like the two foregoing taxes this is also a proper source of revenue for the state Here again as in the case of the income tax it seems to be a good place for the state to add on its tax to the federal tax and have its own share distributed back to it Our high tax authorities are agreed that most of the inheritance tax should be kept by the state 4 Consumption tax sales tax Our sales tax as now in force is aREDISTRIBUTING SOURCES OF REVENUE 275 monstrosity from every standpoint and should be abandoned in toto Its rates varying from three per cent to one hundred per cent are a hint as to its administrative complexities A consumption tax is always wrong in theory but seems to be necessary as one of those compromises which constitute any working system of tax ation Consumption taxes should be looked on as supplementing the income tax Those persons having incomes of under 1000 under the scheme above would pay no federal tax at all if they were not reached by some form of indirect tax A very short list of articles should come under the consumption tax It is common to lay down the general principle here of no tax on necessaries heavy taxes on luxuries No one can satisfactorily define luxuries however It is also con sidered proper to tax harmful con sumption  or  wasteful consumption It seems obvious that at least two commodities lend themselves to the consumption tax namely beverages and tobacco It seems highly desir able as well as expedient to increase very materially the taxes on tobacco The tremendous and rapid increase in the use of this weed particularly by the young men in the form of cigarettes by young men who would otherwise escape all federal taxes and the con comitant and rapid rise in our annual fire loss from fires attributable to cigarette and cigar stubs mark out this commodity as a fit subject for much heavier taxes 5 Customs The protective tariff is destined to play a smaller and smaller part in our budget We are beginning to realize that if we will sell abroad we must buy A tariff for revenue would have to be placed on some item of general consumption such as coffee and this sort of tariff for political reasons is not likely to be enacted Customs duties should from the stand point of national welfare form but a small fraction of our income which is the case now The present five or six per cent of the total federal revenue coming from this source might well be reduced to even lower terms These five taxes thenincome in heritance corporation consumption and customsshould furnish the fed eral revenue The first three should also furnish the states a large share of their revenues STATE AND CITY REVENUE As just stated above the state should secure jointly with the Federal Government revenue from three sourcesincomes inheritances cor porations Complete separation of state and local sources of revenue is one of those tax shibboleths which is now in the discard There should be some separation but not complete separation Hence the state revenues collected from the three sources named above should in part be distributed back to the local subdivisions In most cases except to rural school dis tricts revenues should be distributed back on the basis so far as practicable of the amount collected or earned in that district Land Tax The big source of rev enue left untapped by the Federal Government is of course the land tax In theory the unearned increment of land is a fit subject for taxation Possibly this theory has some validity for city land but for farm land it is difficult to see the justice of it or the feasibility of applying it The pioneer who has seen the largest increment in the value of his land feels that the years of privations and hardships have earned him this increment The ex emption from taxation of all improve ments on land and all forms of per sonal property is a desirable goal276 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY towards which to travel Ample rev enues can be secured from the land taxes plus the three forms of taxes named first above It is not necessary or desirable to enter into a discussion of those various forms of fees and licenses which are now in use in the average American city The aim of this article is to state in broad outline what seems sound in principle and workable in practice The chief emphasis has been thrown on two thingsthe fed eral tax system and coperation be tween the federal and state govern ments

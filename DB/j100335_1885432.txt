runs consistently through these two volumes and gives unity to the authors whole system of thought is that government compulsion is better than voluntary agreement among individuals as a means of getting things done Germany is used more frequently than any other country as an illustration of the effectiveness of government compulsion and England is the horrible example of the sys tem of voluntary agreement In spite of the odium in which the author holds the morals and the ambitions of the House of Hohenzollern he attributes the undoubted economic and military strength of the German empire to its system of government compulsion The government as a conscious entity has known what it wanted and has gone deliberately about the work of getting it It has not scrupled to use its power of compulsion whenever it could add a cubit to its stature by so doing England and other liberalistic countries on the other hand have relied upon voluntary agreements among individuals as a means of getting their work done In many cases this has left important things undone or improp erly done to the disadvantage of the national interests In the volume entitled Trade Fallacies the author shows Chapter I how Germany has begun with the psychological problem and has deliberately through governmental action cultivated or created a psychology not only among her own people but throughout the world favorable to herself whereas liberal governments have relied wholly on spontaneous good 1 Trade Fallacies By Arthur Kitson London P S King and Son 1917 pp 286 A Fraudulent Standard By Arthur Kitson London P S King and Son 1917 pp 233 393394 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS will Seeing that practically all the world except the Turks and the Bulgarians have taken sides against Germany a critic might question how successful Germany was in her governmentowned psychology factory But when one con siders how slow the world was to take up arms against un doubted atrocities not simply in Armenia but in Belgium and wherever the TurkoTeutonic power held sway one begins to see how effective the psychological preparation of the German machine had been Even the expansion of German trade and commerce the author thinks was in part due to the conscious and organized efforts of the German government to create favorable psychological conditions in other countries The English government loaned no such aid to her exporters but left them to earn for themselves whatever good will they secured In Chapter 2 on  The Financial Factor the author has an opportunity to develop his favorite monetary theory He points out how Germany by using her power of compulsion to force on a docile people a system of paper currency has been able to finance her war more cheaply than the liberal govern ments have been able to do The latter relying upon volun tary agreement rather than government compulsion have had to keep a supply of gold in order to make people willing voluntarily to accept whatever paper they have used On page 22 he states  Aside from the settlement of Foreign Exchange balances and payments for foreign propaganda work  where by the way her power of compulsion cannot yet displace voluntary agreement  gold is of comparatively little importance to Germany at the present time If the Central Powers were to lose every ounce of gold and silver they have amassed it would have little or no effect upon the war so long as their foreign trade is cut off In a closed selfsupporting empire which the Teutonic Powers and their Allies may be said  within certain limits  to comprise its entire business can be as easily as satisfactorily and far more economically carried on by a State Bank paper currency system than with a gold and silver currency He goes on the assumption however that there shall be government comREVIEWS 395 pulsion on the one hand and willing obedience on the other So long as a paper money is made legal tender throughout the Empire for all debts public and private so long as the government itself honors it and keeps the amounts issued within certain bounds there is no reason why such a system should not enable the enemy to develop his resources as the United States developed hers so successfully for the whole of the greenback period Most American economists would probably say that the United States developed its resources during that period in spite of the greenbacks Undoubtedly the experience of Germany has been a revela tion in many ways as to what can be accomplished by govern ment compulsion The old style advocates of hard money were in the habit of saying that the government could not create  fiat money  and make it circulate Germany has shown that it can The advocate of hard money can still say truly that it requires a greater exercise of government authority than most liberal governments are in the habit of exercising or than most democratic peoples are in the habit of submitting to The second of the two volumes before us is a more elaborate and detailed attack upon the gold standard and the system of relying upon voluntary agreement in monetary affairs Gov ernment compulsion may do many things if the government will enforce its decrees and if a democratic people will submit to this enforcement Beyond the elaboration of this general idea the volume contains nothing either in the way of argu ment or illustration which was not repeated ad nauseam during our greenback controversy of the 70s and 80s In the first of the two volumes before us the author con trasts the consular service of England with that of Germany also the banking systems the trade methods the attitude of the state toward industry and the general methods of waging trade war He argues under all these heads that the German system is better for the German than the English system is for the English The English banker for example is just as will ing to finance a foreigner as an Englishman even when they are competing for foreign trade Not only will German banks396 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS favor German enterprise but the government itself shows marked discrimination both at home and abroad in favor of German competitors Even German courts p 182183 have not regarded a foreigner as having many rights when they conflicted with the interests of German citizens T N CARVER HARVARD UNIVERSITY

constitutionalfinesforfeitures Section 1220 of the Code imposing a forfeiture of not less than 100 on express companies and others for excessive charges onehalf of which is given to the informer is not in conflict with Sec 7 of Art VIII of the Constitution of the State The fines mentioned in the Constitution are the fines imposed by law as a punishment for crime and do not include forfeitures recoverable in a civil action But even if such forfeitures are embraced within the Constitutional provision the Legislature has power to give onehalf to the informer as expense of recovery The fine dedicated to the literary fund is the States part of the recovery 2 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWLegislative discretionmaximum finesexcessive verdicts The imposition and regulation of fines is within the discretion of the Legislature and its discretion will not be questioned by the courts except where the minimum penalty is so excessive as to shock the sense of mankind Section 1220 of the Code is not in conflict with sec 11 Art I of the Constitution forbidding ex cessive fines and the fact that no maximum fine is fixed by the section does not render the act unconstitutional Excessive verdicts are under the control of the courts 3 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWOperation of amendment VIIIof Constitution of the U S Art VIII of Amendments to the Constitution of the United States has refer ence solely to the

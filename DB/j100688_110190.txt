the apparatus for regulating the more delicate movements of the telescope In order to protect it from the weather which was found to injure its action and derange its adjustments the author erected an obser vatory to contain it consisting of a light piece of carpentry 16 feet in diameter with a revolving conical roof rising 9 feet above the walls containing about 360 square feet of surface and weighing about 10 cwt It is moveable by a simple apparatus made to re volve and open to any required azimuth by the application of a force of about 10 or 12 pounds His first object in the preliminary experiments was to ascertain the best position of the lenses for diminishing as much as possible the secondary spectrum For this purpose he reverts to the formulie given in a preceding paper whence he deduces equations applicable to this object The mode of constructing different parts of the tele scope is then particularly described especially that of the fluid lenses and of effecting the proper centering and other adjustments He then describes its power when applied to several double stars By its means n Persei marked as a treble star in Souths and Herschels catalogue is seen distinctly sextuple four of the smaller of these stars together with a larger one form a miniature representation of Jupiter and his satellites Of the planets he has only had opportu nities of trying the telescope on Venus Saturn and Mars all of which appear with remarkable brightness and distinctness The moon is also remarkably beautiful every minute distinction of figure and shade being brought into viewThe paper concludes with a detailed description of the various parts of the telescope and stand illustrated by a drawing On the Dip of the Magnetic Needle in London in August 1828 By Captain Edward Sabine of the Royal Artillery Sec RS Read January 8 1829 Phil Trans 1829 p 47 This paper commences by noticing that the Philosophical Transac tions contain the record of observations on the dip of the needle in London from the early part of the last century to the present time That these observations all concur in showing a progressive decrease of the dip during the whole period in question but that they are in sufficient in number and frequency and the earlier ones particularly in the required accuracy to enable us to determine whether tho an nual decrease has been uniform or otherwise The author having taken much pains to obtain a correct determi nation of the dip in the Regents Park in August 1821 published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1822 repeated his observations in August 1828 at the expiration of seven years from the former determination an interval which he considered sufficient to throw light on the rate at which the dip is at present diminishing In con sequence of the increase of buildings in the Regents Park he was induced to change the place of observatiQo to the Horticultural So358 cietys garden at Chiswick the distance apart is about five miles but the direction is as nearly as possible that of the line of equal dip The apparatus modes of observing and needles employed are fully described The needles were four in number one of the or dinary construction a second fitted with Professor Meyers appa ratus for avoiding the errors arising from the noncoincidence of the centres of gravity and motion a third having a cross of wires at tached to the axis on the wellknown plan of Dr Mitchell and a fourth devised by Mr Dollond the middle of which is a cube per forated at right angles so that the axis may be inserted in eight dif ferent ways In addition to his own apparatus and needles the author obtained from the Colonial Department the use of a smaller apparatus with a needle on Professor Meyers plan the same which was used by Cap tain Franklin on his last land expedition The observations with this apparatus were made by Mr David Douglas of the Horticul tural Society The results were as follows With the ordinary needle  690 46 1 With Meyers needle  69 47 4 With a needle having an adjusted axis  69 38 3 With Mr Dollonds needle  69 51 7 With the smaller apparatus  69 51 4 Dip in London in August 1828  69 47 0 From the observations of 1821 and 1828 the author finds a de crease in the dip in London of 17 5 in seven years or an annual decrease of 2 5 The average annual decrease for the century preceding 1821 ap pears from the most authentic observations to have exceeded 3 On examining the series of observations made on the dip in Paris since 1798 by MM Humboldt Gay Lussac and Arago the author finds a corresponding indication of a recent diminution in the yearly decrease of the dip it appearing by those observations that the average yearly decrease in the first half of the period between 1798 and 1828 exceeded 475 and in the second half fell short of 3 He concludes by remarking that a repetition of the observations in London at the expiration of another seven years and a continuation of those at Paris will probably afford a decisive indication on this point and notices in case the annual change shall prove to be di minishing in this part of the world the importance of determining the precise period at which the dip shall become stationary and the minimumu to which it shall then have arrived

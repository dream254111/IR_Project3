recent survey of the names applied to the genera of fishes shows the necessity of a number of changes from the names adopted by Jordan and Evermann Fishes of North and Middle America 1898 Among those which most concern students of American Ichthyology are the following Anchoviella Fowler replaces Stolephorus Lace pede as the name of the great body of tropical ancho vies The type of Stolephorus as first restricted was not an anchovy but a round herring of Japan Bagre Cuvier by tautonomy replaces Felichthys and Ailurichthys for the Gaff topsail catfish Bagre felis L Bodianus Bloch by tautonomy replaces Harpe Lacepede while Cephalopholis Bloch  Schneider replaces Bodianus and Enneacentrus Chelon Rose replaces Chdenomugil Corvina Cuvier stands for the group called Pseudosciaena Cheilotrema and Callaus may be genera distinct from Corvina Clupanodon Lacepede should be restricted to the Asiatic genus called Konosirus The true sar dines S pilchardus of Europe and S ccerulea of California belong to the genus Sardina Antapa Those sardines with unstriated opercle S aurita and S anchoviapseudohispanica comprise the genus Sardinella called Sardinia by Poey The Scaled SarCOPEIA dines maculosa macro phthalma etc constitute the genus Harengula well separated from Sardina and Sardinella by their firm flesh and adherent scales The type of Etheostoma should be E blenni oides The name should replace Diplesion while the genus called Etheostoma by Jordan and Evermann should stand as Poecilichthys Some of the sub genera in this group should stand as distinct genera The genus called Centrarchus should stand as Eucentrarchus Gill and the family of Sunfishes and Black Bass as Micropteridae The name Gerres Cuvier should replace Xystce ma while the genus called Gerres by Jordan and Evermann becomes Diapterus The family stands as Eucinostomidae as there is an earlier family Ger ridae among insects Histrio Fischer replaces Pterophryne Leucichthys Dybowski replaces Argyrosomus preoccupied for the Lake Herrings and Ciscoes Several new species of these have been described by Jordan and Evermann from the Great Lakes The Trout Perch of the Lakes should stand as Percopsis omiscomaycus WValbaum instead of Per copsis guttatus The Lake Sturgeon as Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque instead of A4cipenser rubicun dus Le Sueur as Mr Hubbs has noted The Ameri can eel is A4nguilla rostrata Le Sueur Sept 1817 instead of A chrisypa Rafinesque Dec 1817 The date of rostrata is incorrectly given by Jordan  Evermann Membras Bonaparte replaces Kirtlandia Micrometrus Gibbons replaces Abeona Phycis Rose replaces Emphycus and Urophycis Polynemus L replaces Polydactylus The generic name Catulus is preoccupied in in sects The genus of sharks so named becomes Scylliorhinus Siphostoma Rafinesque becomes again Syngna thus and Lucius Rafinesque reverts to Esox while 86COPEIA Esox Rafinesque becomes again Belone Cuvier Glossamia pandionis becomes Xystramia pandionis There are no species of Leucos in America the species socalled being referable to Myloleucus Cope and Hesperoleucus Snyder There are according to Prof Cockerell no true species of Leuciscus in America or Japan The American species so called stand for the present as Richardsonius Gerard though some of the included sections Clinostomus Phoxinus Hemitremia Siboma may prove to be of generic value Cheilonemus Baird replaces Leu cosomus preoccupied Cremnobates Giinther re places Auchenopterus preoccupied Cynicoglossus Bonaparte replaces Microstomus preoccupied Eu dulus Fowler replaces Dules Evermannellus Fow ler replaces Odontostomus Haloporphyrus Giinther replaces Lepidion Notoscopelus Giinther replaces Macrostoma Quassilabia Jordan and Brayton re places Lagochilus Scaphirhynchops Gill replaces Scaphirhynchus Stenesthes Jordan replaces Steno tomus preoccupied The Scup becomes thus Sten esthes chrysops Xiphister Jordan and Gilbert re places Xiphidion Carcharhinus con mersoni Blainville should probably stand instead of C lamia Isurus tigris Atwood replaces Isurus dekayi Isurus oxyrhyn chus European species not yet known from our coast Latmna nasius Bonnaterre has priority over Lamna cornubica Gmelin Mustelus Valmont 1764 or of Linck 1790 must stand for the smooth Dog Sharks which may for the present pending investigation be left in one genus Mustelus Valmont is equivalent to Cynias Gill Mustelus Linck to Pleuracromylon The species are Mustelus asterias Valmiont or Cynias canis Mitchill and Mustelus or Pleuracromylon mustelus L The name Raja diaphanes Mitchill replaces Raja ocellata preoccupied Raja scabrata Garman replaces Raja radiata not found in America and 87COPEIA Raja stabuliforis Garman replaces Raja laevis re garded as preoccupied Raja granulata Gill is a valid species The name Mobula replaces Aodon unidentifi able The group of suckers called Hypentelium con stitutes a valid genus The species of this group called Catostomus rhothoecus by Dr Thoburn seems to constitute a new genus which we may name Tho burnia Jordan and Snyder in honor of Wilbur Tho burn professor of bionomics in Stanford University a young man whose life came to an untimely end and who is remembered by his students not only as a gifted naturalist but as a powerful moral influence in the lives of all associated with him Thoburnia is distinguishable from Hypentelium by the very small head the skull not concave between the eyes Xyrauchen texanus Abbott replaces X cypho Among the Hexagrammoslike fishes several distinct families must be recognized each with but a genus or two These are Anoplopomatidae Erilepi dae Hexagrammidae Ophiodontidae Zaniolepidae and Oxylebiidae Erilepis zonifer grows to a large size upwards of a hundred pounds in Japan and in Alaska where it is occasionally taken The black bars disappear with age The Fat Priest of Japan Ebisus sagamius Jordan and Snyder is the adult of this species of which the young was called Erilepis zonifer Zaniolepis frenatus Eigenmann is generi cally different from Zaniolepis latipinnis having the head much larger and more strongly armed the su praorbital cirrus large and the second dorsal spine not specially elevated shorter than the second and shorter than head This species may be made the type of a new genus Xantocles Zaniolepis from xanion a wool card or comb and lepis scale should have been spelled with an initial X Under the ruling of the International Commis sion of Zoological Nomenclature the generic names 88COPEIA of Gronow 1763 with polynomial species have been accepted This ruling would also apparently validate the generic names revived from Klein in the dictionary called the Gesellschaft Schauplatz 1775 1781 Certain names of Valmont de Bomare 1768 may be eligible and certain subgeneric names in Ara bic of Forskal 1775 If these should be adopted Amia Gronow would replace Apogon Amiatus Ra finesque would replace Amia L 1766 Brama Klein would replace Abramis and Lepodus Rafin esque Brama Schneider for the Sea Bream Callyo don Gronow would replace Scarus Cestracion Klein replaces Sphyrna Galeus Valmont or Cynocephalus Klein replaces Prionace Cyclogaster Gronow re places Liparis Enchelyopus Gronow Zoarces Hepatus Gronow replaces Teuthis L Dasybatus Klein replaces Dasyatis Rhina Klein supersedes Squatina Rhombus Klein replaces Bothus while Peprilus Cuvier replaces Rhombus Lacepede for the genus of Harvestfishes Poronotus and Palometa are probably both distinct from Rhombus The Thresher Shark Alopias vulpinus Bonna terre A vulpes Gmelin was named Vulpecula ma rina by Valmont in 1768 Garman adopts this name but it may not be officially considered eligible It is possible that these generic names may not be finally accepted and it will be safe not to use any of them not validated by acceptance of later authors until their eligibility is finally determined The au thors concerned are mainlv Gronow Klein Valmont de Bomare and Patrick Browne DAVID STARR JORDAN Stanford University Cal HUNTING LIZARDS WITH A BEAN SHOOTER The writer has before him a shipment of rep tiles from the West including a really choice lot of 89

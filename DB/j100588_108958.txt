J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108958,ON UNIFORM ROTATION,I207021,E 657  XXIII ON UNIFORM ROTATION BY C W SIEMENS FRS HFERM INST CUE RECEIVED MLARCH 10READ APRIL 12 1866 AMONGST THE MEANS AT OUR DISPOSAL FOR OBTAINING UNIFORM ROTATION THERE IS NONE FOR WHICH THE SAME DEGREE OF ACCURACY CAN BE CLAIMED AS THAT WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE VIBRATING PENDULUM OR THE OSCILLATING SPRINGWHEEL OF THE COMMON WATCH YET THERE ARE MANY PURPOSES BOTH IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS FOR WHICH SMALLER SUBDIVISIONS OF TIME THAN THE PERIOD OF ONE OSCILLATION ARE MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE AND WHICH CAN ONLY BE MEASURED BY UNIFORM ROTATION GONICAL PENDULUMTHE APPARATUS BY WHICH CONTINUOUS ROTATION OF THE GREATEST REGU LARITY HAS HITHERTO BEEN OBTAINED IS THE CONICAL PENDULUM WHICH WAS FIRST APPLIED BY JAMES WATT TO REGULATE THE SPEED OF HIS ENGINES AND WHICH HAS SINCE RECEIVED FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN THE INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS THE CHRONOMETRIC GOVERNOR ON EXAMINING INTO THE PRINCIPLE INVOLVED IN THE CONICAL PENDULUM IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE TIME T OF ITS ROTATION IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS LENGTH 1 AND ON THE ANGLE E WHICH IT MAKES WITH ITS VERTICAL AXIS OF ROTATION WHICH DEPENDENCE IS EXPRESSED BY THE FORMULA COS  THE COEFFICIENT P BEING A FUNCTION DUE TO GRAVITATION THE VALUE OF T BEING DEPENDENT UPON O6 IT FOLLOWS THAT UNIFORM ROTATION OF A CONICAL PENDULUM CANNOT BE OBTAINED EXCEPT ON CONDITION THAT THE ANGLE OF ITS ROTATION REMAINS CONSTANT WATTS GOVERNORIN THE CASE OF WATTS CENTRIFUGAL GOVERNOR THE ANGLE OF ROTATION OF THE PENDULUM VARIES WITH EVERY CHANGE IN THE RELATIVE CONDITION OF POWER AND LOAD ON THE ENGINE AND THE CHANGE OF ANGLE IS INDEED TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF TO CLOSE OR OPEN THE STEAMSUPPLYT VALVE IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE STEAM OR THROTTLE VALVE THE ANGLE OF ROTATION HAS TO BE INCREASED WHICH NECESSITATES A CORRESPONDING INCREASE OF THE ENGINES VELOCITY ON THE OTHER HAND AN INCREASE OF THE VALVEORIFICE CANNOT BE EFFECTED WITHOUT A REDUCTION OF THE SPEED OFT THE ENGINE TAKING PLACE CONSIDERING THIS DEPENDENCE OF THE ACTION OF THE INSTRUMENT UPON PERMANENT CHANGE OF SPEED OF THE ENGINE THE NAME OF GOVERNOR SEEMS INAPPROPRIATE THE INSTRUMENT BEING IN FACT ONLY A MODERATOR OF THE AMOUNT OF FLUCTUATION TO WHICH THE ENGINE WOULD BE SUBJECTED WITHOUT ITS AGENCY THE AMOUNT OF THESE FLUCTUATIONS DEPENDS IN A GREAT MEASURE UPON THE MECHANICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE INSTRUMENT WHICH IS GENERALLY SPEAKING VERY OBJECTIONABLE INASMUCH AS THE PENDULOUS ARMS ARE MOSTLY SUSPENDED AT POINTS BESIDE THE COMMON AXIS OF ROTATION GIVING RISE TO AN INCREASED VARIATION OF TIRME FOR A GIVEN CHANGE OF ANGLE THE REASON BEING THAT THE TRUE PENDULOUS LENGTH HAS TO BE MEASURED FROM THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF THE PENDULUMS OR RODS WITH THE AXIS OF 4X 2658 MR C W SIEMENS ON UNIFORTI ROTATION ROTATION WHICH POINT DESCENDS AS THE ANGLE INCREASES CAUSING THE PENDULOUS LENGTH TO DIMINISH AT BOTH EXTREMITIES A BETTER RESULT WOULD BE OBTAINED IF EACH PENDULOUS ROD WERE SUSPENDED FROM THE POINT PAST THE AXIS OF ROTATION AS SHOWN BY DOTTED LINES IN FIG 1 CAUSING THE TWO RODS TO CROSS IN THE LINE OF THE AXIS AT A POINT WHICH WOULD RISE WITH INCREASE OF ANGLE AND RENDER THE TRUE PENDULOUS LENGTH APPROXIMATELY UNIFORM BETWEEN CERTAIN LIMITS THE GOVERNOR OF WATT IS HOWEVER SUBJECT TO ANOTHER DEFECT WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT OF AN EASY RECTIFICATION AND WHICH CONSISTS IN ITS WANT OF POWER TO OPERATE ON THE STEAMVALVE AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE POWER AND LOAD ON THE ENGINE IS DISTURBED IT WILL BE SEEN THAT WHILE THE ENGINE PROCEEDS UNIFORMLY GRAVITATION AND CENTRIFUGAL FORCE MUST BE IN EQUILIBRIUM FIG 1 I I    AS REGARDS THE GOVERNORBALLS BUT AT THE MOMENT WHEN FOR INSTANCE A PORTION OF THE LOAD ON THE ENGINE IS REMOVED STEAMPOWER WILL BE SET AT LIBERTY FOR ACCELERATING THE FLYWHEEL THIS ACCELERATION PROCEEDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WELLKNOWN GRAVITATION LAWS UNTIL THE INCREASE OF CENTRIFUGAL FORCE IMPARTED TO THE GOVERNORBALLS SUFFICES TO OVERCOME THE FRICTION OF THE VALVE AND ITS MECHANICAL CONNEXIONS WHICH ARE NOT INCON SIDERABLE IN THE MEAN TIME THE SPEED OF THE ENGINE WILL HAVE BEEN INCREASED TO AN EXTENT CONSIDERABLY BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE VALVE IN ITS NEW ADJUSTMENT THE ACTION OF THE GOVERNOR WHEN IT DOES TAKE PLACE WILL THEREFORE BE EXCESSIVE AND A SERIES OF FLUCTUATIONS IN THE SPEED OF THE ENGINE MUST FOLLOW BEFORE THE PROPER READJUSTMENT OF ITS VALVE CAN BE EFFECTED CHRONOMETRIC GOVERNORIMPRESSED WITH THESE IMPERFECTIONS IN WATTS CENTRIFUGAL GOVERNOR I PROPOSED TWENTYTHREE YEARS AGO IN CONNEXION WITH MY BROTHER WERNER SIEMENS A GOVERNOR BASED ALSO ON THE CONICAL PENDULUM WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS TO BE INDEPENDENT IN ITS ACTION OF CHANGE IN ITS ANGULAR ROTATION AND MOREOVER WAS TO BE PROVIDED ALWAYS WITH A STORE OF POWER READY TO OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE OF THE VALVE AT THE FIRST MOMENT WHEN THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE POWER AND LOAD OF THE ENGINE WAS DISTURBED THIS INSTRUMENT THE CHRONOMETRIC GOVERNOR HAS BEEN APPLIED WITH SUC CESS IN MANY CASES WHERE ENGINES WERE REQUIRED TO WORK WITH GREAT REGULARITY UNDER VARYING CONDITIONS OF LOAD IT HAS ALSO RECEIVED AN INTERESTING APPLICATION BY THE ASTRO NOMER ROYAL FOR REGULATING ASTRONOMICAL AND CHRONOGRAPHICAL INSTRUMENTS PROVING THE HIGH DEGREE OF PRECISION OF WHICH IT IS CAPABLE THE LEADING IDEA INVOLVED IN THIS GOVERNOR CONSISTED IN PROVIDING A CONICAL PENDULUM IN UNIFORM ROTATION AND IN ESTABLISHING A DIFERENTIAL MOTION BETWEEN IT AND THE WHEEL DRIVEN BY THE ENGINE WHICH DIFFERENTIAL MOTION WAS MADE TO ACT UPON THE SOURCE OF POWER OF THE LATTER IF THIS IDEA COULD BE CARRIED OUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ENGINE OR MACHINE TO BE GOVERNED MUST SUIT ITS MOTION CLOSELY TO THAT OF THE INDEPENDENT ROTATING PENDULUM BECAUSE THE LEAST RETARDATION ON ITS PART MUST IMMEDIATELY RESULT IN AN ENLARGEMENT OF THE VALVEORIFICE IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT AN INCREASE OF AVAILABLE POWERMR 0C W SIEMENS ON UNIFORM ROTATION 669 IS ALWAYS OBTAINABLE AND THE LEAST MOTION IN ADVANCE OF THE PENDULUM MUST AUTOMA TICALLY REDUCE THE SOURCE OF POWER THIS ACTION WOULD BE EFFECTED INSTANTLY NOTWITHW STANDING A CONSIDERABLE RESISTANCE IN THE VALVE BECAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM IN ROTATION REPRESENTS IN THIS CASE A STORE OF POWER INASMUCH AS ITS ANGULAR VELOCITY WOULD HAVE TO BE SUDDENLY CHECKED OR INCREASED AS THE CASE MAY BE UNLESS THE VALVE OBEYED THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF A DIFFERENTIAL MOTION IN ORDER TO REALIZE THESE CONDITIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE CONICAL PENDULUM IN QUESTION AT A UNIFORM ANGLE OF ROTATION NOTWITHSTANDING THE CHANGES OF DRIVING OR SUSTAININGPOWER WHICH MUST NECES SARILY ARISE THROUGH ITS ACTION UPON THE REGULATING VALVE OF THEE ENGIE AND THIS COULD ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PROVIDING THE MEANS OF DESTROYING OR ABSORBING ANY EXCESS OF DRIVINGPOWER BEYOND WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO OVERCOME THE FRICTION OF THE INSTRUMENT AND WHICH MUST TEND OTHERWISE TO INCREASE ITS ANGLE OF ROTATION ON THE OTHER HAND A SURPLUS OF DRIVINGPOWER HAD TO BE PROVIDED TO PREVENT AN OCCASIONAL COLLAPSE OF THE PENDULUM IN OPENING THE VALVE THESUSTAINING OR DRIVINGPOWER OF THE PENDULUM WAS OBTAINED IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL MOTION A WEIGHT BEING ATTACHED TO A HORIZONTAL LEVER UPON THE THROTTLEVALVE SPINDLE WHICH IN EXERTING A PRESSURE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL WHEEL AGAINST THE TWO PRINCIPAL WHEELS CAUSED AN IMPULSE TO BE GIVEN TO THE ONE CONNECTED WITH THE PEN DULUM WHEREAS THE THIRD WHEEL WAS DRIVEN BY THE ENGINE MI THE DIRECTION PROPER TO RAISE THE WEIGHT CONTINUALLY THE EXCESS OF DRIVINGPOWER IMPARTED TO THE PENDULUM WAS DESTROYED BY CALLING INTO ACTION A FRICTION BETWEEN TWO SOLID SUBSTANCES AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE ANGLE OF ROTATION HAD REACHED ITS INTENDED MAXIMUM OR A LIQUID RESISTANCE WAS INTRODUCED SUCH AS A FAN ROTATING WITH THE PENDULUM BEING DIPPED INTO A BATH OF MERCURY OR OTHER LIQUID AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE EXTENSION OF THE PENDULUM WAS ATTAINED SEE FIG 2 THE GOVERNORS CONSTRUCTED ON THIS PRINCIPLE ARE REMARK ABLE FOR THEIR INSTANTANEOUS ACTION UPON THE SUPPLYVALVE OF THE ENGINE WHEN A SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE BALANCE BETWEEN LOAD AND POWER TAKES PLACE AND THEY POSSESS ALSO TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THE POWER OF MAINTAINING THE REGULATED MACHINE AT THE SAME SPEED WHEN THE LOAD REACHES ITS MAXIMUM AS WHEN IT IS AT ITS MINIMUM IN THE HANDS OF THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL THE UNIFORMITY OF MOTION OBTAINED BY THE USE OF THIS GOVERNOR APPROACHES INDEED THAT OF AN ORDINARY CHRONOMETER YET IT IS NOT FREE FROM OBJECTIONS RESULTING FROM THE DELICATE ADJUSTMENT AND FREQUENT ATTENTION REQUISITE TO MAINTAIN IT IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION IN ITS APPLICATION TO THE REGULATING OF PHYSICAL RI 2 I H J 660 MR C W SIEMENS ON UNIFORM ROTATION APPARATUS IT HAS MOREOVER BEEN FOUND THAT THE CONICAL PENDULUM IS APT TO FALL INTO ELLIP TICAL ROTATION WHEREBY THE SUBDIVISIONS OF TIME BELOW THE HALF SECOND BECOME INACCURATE FOUCAULTS GOVERNORMONSIEUR FOUCAULT OF PARIS HAS TREATED THE SAME QUESTION IN A DIFFERENT MANNER SUBSTITUTING FOR THE FRICTION BETWEEN SOLIDS OR OF SOLIDS AGAINST FLUIDS WHICH WE EMPLOYED TO FIX THE ANGLE OF ROTATION OF THE CONICAL PENDULUM THE VARYING RESISTANCE OF AN AIRPROPELLER ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT OF AREA FOR THE ESCAPE OF AIR WHICH AREA HE REGULATES BYMEANS OF THE ANGULAR ELEVATION OF HIS CONICAL PENDULUM THE CONICAL PENDULUM HE EMPLOYS IS MOUNTED IN THE MANNER OF A WATTS GOVERNOR OF THE BEST CONSTRUCTION WHICH RENDERS HIS APPARATUS PORTABLE AND THEREFORE CONVENIENT FOR GENERAL PURPOSES WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND IT APPEARS TO DEPEND FOR ITS CORRECT ACTION UPON THE PERFECT CONDITION OF MANY MECHANICAL DETAILS SOME MONTHS SINCE AN IDEA SUGGESTED ITSELF TO ME WHICH WHILE IT FURNISHES THE ELE MENTS OF A VERY GENERAL AND COMPLETE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM UNDER CONSIDERATION APPEARS TO POSSESS ALSO A SEPARATE SCIENTIFIC INTEREST WHICH CHIEFLY INDUCES ME TO BRING THE SUBJECT BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY LIQUID IN ROTATIONIF AN OPEN CYLINDRICAL GLASS VESSEL OR TUMBLER CONTAINING SOME LIQUID BE MADE TO ROTATE UPON ITS VERTICAL AXIS THE LIQUID WILL BE OBSERVED TO RISE FROM THE CENTRE TOWARDS THE SIDES TO A HEIGHT DEPENDING ON THE ANGULAR VELOCITY AND THE DIAMETER OF THE VESSEL AS SOON AS THE VELOCITY HAS REACHED A CERTAIN LIMIT THE LIQUID WILL COMMENCE TO OVERFLOW THE UPPER EDGE OF THE VESSEL BEING THROWN FROM IT IN THE FORM OF A FLUID SHEET IN A TANGENTIAL DIRECTION IF THE VELOCITY REMAIN CONSTANT FROM THIS MOMENT THE OVERFLOW OF THE LIQUID WILL BE OBSERVED TO CEASE ALTHOUGH THE LIQUID REMAINING IN THE VESSEL WILL CONTINUE TO TOUCH THE EXTREME EDGE OR BRIM SUPPOSING THAT THE VELOCITY OF THE VESSEL BE NOW DIMINISHED THE LIQUID WILL BE OBSERVED TO SINK BUT WILL RISE AGAIN IMMEDIATELY TO ITS FORMER POSITIONWWHEN THE ROTATION RETURNS TO ITS PREVIOUS LIMIT OF ANGULAR VELOCITY THIS VELOCITY IS THE RESULT OF THE BALANCE OF TWO FORCES ACTING ON THE LIQUID PARTICLES NAMELY GRAVITY AND CENTRIFUGAL FORCE IT IS A WELLKNOWN FACT THAT THE CURVILINEAR SURFACE PRODUCED BY A LIQUID IN ROTATION IS THAT OF A PARABOLOID THE PARAMETER OF WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY W2 AND THE CURVE ITSELF THEREFORE BY THE FORMULA 2 2G             I X SIGNIFYING VERTICAL DISTANCE FROM THE APEX Y THE CORRESPONDING HORIZONTAL DISTANCE FROMN THE AXIS OF ROTATION W THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF ROTATION AND G ACCELERATION BY GRAVITY IN ONE SECOND IN THIS FORMULA THERE IS NO FACTOR DENOTING THE DENSITY OF THE LIQUID WHICH PROVES TILAT THE POINT TO WHICH THE LIQUID IS RAISED BY A GIVEN ANGULAR VELOCITY IS INDEPENDENT OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE LIQUID EMPLOYED BY SUBSTITUTING FOR Y THE RADIUS R OF THE ROTATING CUP AT THE BRIM AND FOR X THE HEIGHTMR C W SIEMENS ON UNIFORM ROTATION 661 H OF THE BRIM ABOVE THE LOWEST LEVEL OF THE LIQUID WE MAY WRITE THE FOREGOING GENERAL FORMULAE AS FOLLOWS EW II AND W III  7 TWO CONVENIENT FORMULAE FOR DETERMINING THE HEIGHT TO WHICH LIQUID WILL RISE WHEN THE DIAMETER OF THE ROTATING VESSEL AND ITS ANGULAR VELOCITY ARE GIVEN OR FOR DETERMINING THE ANGULAR VELOCITY DUE TO A GIVEN HEIGHT AND DIAMETER IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT THE VALUES OF G R AND H MUST BE EXPRESSED IN THE SAME UNIT OF LENGTH IF IT IS DESIRED TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONS PER SECOND N INSTEAD OF THE ANGULAR VELOCITY W WE MAY PUT 2W AND IN PUTTING THIS VALUE FOR W 2TRN INTO THE LAST FORMULA WE HAVE 42GHIV 2RVR THESE FORMULAE ARE APPLICABLE TO VESSELS OF EVERY POSSIBLE EXTERNAL FORM ROTATING UPON THEIR VERTICAL AXIS AND TO EVERY POSSIBLE LIQUID BUT THEY ARE BASED UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE LIQUID IS RAISED BY ROTATION TO THE UPPER EDGE OR BRIM OF THE VESSEL A CON DITION WHICH IT MAY APPEAR AT FIRST SIGHT DIFFICULT TO REALIZEFOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES IF THE PRODUCTION OF UNIFORM ROTATION BE THE OBJECT IN VIEW IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE LIQUID IN THE ROTATING VESSEL SHOULD ALWAYS BE AT THE POINT OF OVERFLOW ALTHOUGH THE DRIVINGPOWER MIGHT VARY CONSIDERABLY AND THAT ALL SURPLUS DRIVINGPOWER SHOULD BE ABSORBED BY OTHER WORK THAN THAT OF ACCELERATING THE ROTATING VESSEL ALSO THAT THE STOCK OF LIQUID WITHIN THE VESSEL SHOULD NEVER DIMINISH I HOPE TO PROVE BY THE FOLLOWING DEMONSTRATION THAT THESE VARIOUS CONDITIONS CAN BE FULFILLED BY SUITABLE MECHANICAL ARRANGEMENTS RESULTING IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT INSTRUMENT WHICH IS IS REPRESENTED ON PLATE XXIX AND WHICH HAS SURVIVED THE ORDEAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PROOF LIQUD GYROMETERTHE ROTATING VESSEL CONSISTS IN THIS CASE OF A CUP C PLATE XXIX FIG 1 OPEN BOTH AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM BUT WIDEST AT THE TOP THE SIDES BEING MADE TO CLOSE IN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM IN A PARABOLIC CURVE ANALOGOUS TO THAT FORMED BY THE LIQUID IN ROTATION THIS CUP CONTAINS UPON ITS INNER SURFACE THREE OR FOUR RADIAL RIBS WHICH UNITE IN A CENTRAL BOSS BY WHICH THE CUP IS SUPPORTED UPON THE SPINDLE S THIS SUPPORT IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE ONE BUT THE SPINDLE IS ARMED WITH A SCREWTHREAD OF RAPIDLY ASCENDING PATH INTO WHICH THE SCREWTHREADS UPON THE INNER SURFACE OF THE BOSS ARE MADE TO FIT A FIXED CONNEXION BETWEEN THE DRIVINGSPINDLE AND THE CUP C IS ESTABLISHED BY MEANS OF A SPIRAL SPRING E ONE END OF WHICH IS FASTENED TO THE PROJECTING END OF THE SPINDLE S AND THE OTHER TO THE CUP BEFORE THIS SPRING IS FIXED IT IS DRAWN OUT LONGL662 MR C W SIEMENS ON UNIFORMIROTATION TUDINALLY TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO BALANCE THE WEIGHT OF THE CUP WHICH LATTER MAY THEREFORE BE SAID TO FLOAT UPON THE SCREWTHREADS WITHOUT EXERCISING ANY PRESSURE UPON THE SAME THE UPPER SUPPORT OF THE SPINDLE S IS A BOSS PROJECTING FROM THE BOTTOM OF A CYLIN DRICAL VESSEL B OF GLASS SIDES AND GLASSDOMED TOP WHICH COMPLETELY ENCLOSES THE CUP C WHILE IT RENDERS ITS ACTION VISIBLE THIS OUTER VESSEL IS FILLED WITH LIQUID TO SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO SUBMERGE THE LOWER EDGE OF THE CUP ROTATION OF THE LIQUID IN THE OUTER VESSEL IS PREVENTED BY RADIAL RIBS UPON ITS BOTTOM SURFACE AND UPON THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE ROTATING CUP C TWO CONCENTRIC PROJECTIONS ARE PROVIDED ONE AT THE UPPER EDGE AND THE SECOND NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE OUTER LIQUID FOR THE PURPOSE OF THROWING OFF SOME LIQUID WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE APT TO ADHERE TO THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE CUP INDEFIANCE OF CENTRIFUGAL FORCE AND INTERFERE SLIGHTLY WITH ITS PROPER ACTION ROTATION BEING IMPARTEDTO THE SHAFT S AND THE CUP C BY CLOCKWORK OR FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE THE LIQUID AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP WILL BE ACTED UPONBY CENTRIFUGAL FORCE AND RISE UPON ITS INNER SIDES WHILE ADDITIONAL LIQUID WILL ENTER FROM WITHOUT AND MAINTAIN THE APEX OF THE LIQUID CURVE NEARLY ON A LEVEL WITH THE SURROUNDING LAKE AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE LIQUID IN ROTATION TOUCHES THE UPPER EDGE OF THE CUP THE SPEED SHOULD BE SUCH AS IS DETERMINED BY THE FORMULA 2RR IN WHICH H MAY BE TAKEN FOR THE HEIGHT OF THE BRIM OF THE CUP ABOVE THE LAKE SURFACE BUT CONSIDERING THAT THE POWER NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE CUP AT ITS VELOCITY AFTER THE LIQUID HAS BEEN RAISED TO ITS UPPER EDGE IS EXCEEDINGLY SMALL BECAUSE NO FRESH MATERIAL HAS TO BE PUT INTO MOTION IT WOULD BE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PREVENT FURTHER ACCELE RATION IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIQUID WILL NOT FALL BELOW THE BRIM OF THE ROTATING CUP AN EXCESS OF DRIVINGPOWER MUST BE APPLIED AND THAT EXCESS MUST BE DISPOSED OF OTHERWISE THAN IN PRODUCING FURTHER ACCELERATION OF THE CUP THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF A CONTINUAL OVERFLOW OF A THIN SHEET OF LIQUID WHICH IS PROJECTED AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE OUTER VESSEL AND FALLS BACK INTO THE LAKE AT THE BOTTOM WHENCE A SIMILAR QUANTITY OF LIQUID PENETRATES INTO THE CUP TO BE ALSO RAISED BY ITS ROTATION AND PROJECTED OVER ITS EDGE THE POWER ABSORBED IN RAISING AND PROJECTING THE LIQUID MUST BE STRICTLY PROPORTIONATE TO THE QUANTITY OF LIQUID SO ACTED ON IN A GIVEN TIME OR TO THE THICKNESS OF OVERFLOW PROVIDED THE CONDITION OF UNIFORM VELOCITY BE REALIZED BUT THE VELOCITY OF THE CUP DEPENDS UPON THE HEIGHT TO WHICH THE LIQUID HAS TO BE RAISED AND MUST THEREFORE BE INCREASED IN ORDER TO RAISE THE LIQUID COLUMN ABOVE THE BRIM OF THE CUP THE NECESSARY INCREASE OF VELOCITY TO PRODUCE SUCH AN OVERFLOW IS NOT GREAT CONSIDERING THAT THE HEIGHT OF THE LIQUID COLUMN INCREASES IN THE SQUARE RATIO OF THE VELOCITY AND MAY BE NEGLECTED IN ALL CASES WHEREONLY APPROXIMATE RESULTS ARE REQUIRED OR WHERE VARIATIONS IN THE DRIVINGPOWER ARE COMPARATIVELY SMALL BUT NO HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY COULD HAVE BEEN CLAIMED FOR THIS INSTRUMENT UNLESS THE FOLLOWING COMPENSATING ACTION HAD SUGGESTED ITSELFMR W SIEMES ON UNIFORM ROTATION 663 AUOMATIC DIP OF CUPWE HAVE ASSUMED HITHERTO A RIGID CONEXION BETWEEN THE CUP AND ITS DRIVINGSPINDLE AND UNLESS THE CUP DOES OVERFLOW WE ARE INDEED JUSTIFIED IN THIS ASSUMPTION THE SPRING E BEING TOO RIGID TO YIELD TO THE RESISTANCE OF THE CUP IN MOTION WHEN NO WORK IS PERFORMED WITH AN INCREASE OF POWER THERESISTANCE OF THE CUP ALSO INCREASES AND AN OVERFLOW OF LIQUID PROPORTIONATE TO THE POWER IS PRODUCED THE CONNECTING SPRING EB MUST YIELD AT THE SAME TIME PROPORTIONATELY TO THE TORSIONAL RESISTANCE THUS CREATED AND IN THE SAME RATIO THE CUP WILL DESCEND UPON THE HELICAL SURFACE WHICH SERVESFOR ITS GUIDE WHILE THEREFORE ON THE ONE HAND THE H OF OUR FORMULA INCREASES WITH THE OVERFLOW IT IS DIMINISHED IN THE SAME RATIO BY THE DESCENT OF THE CUP BOTH DEPENDING DIRECTLY UPON THE DRIVINGPOWER WHEN THE STIFFNESS AND LENGTH OF THE SPRING ARE SO ADJUSTED THAT THE ONE ACTION EQUALS THE OTHER FOR ANY GIVEN INCREASE OF POWER IT MUST EQUAL IT ALSO FOR OTHER AMOUNTS OF INCREASE WITHIN REASONABLE LIMITS AND STRICTLY UNIFORM ROTATION MUST BE THE RESULT THE REASONABLE LIMITS TO THIS AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT ARE IMPOSED BY THE RESTRICTED ORIFICE THROUGH WHICH THE LIQUID HAS TO PENETRATE INTO THE CUP AND ALSO BY THE RANGE OF ACTION OF THE SPRING FOR WHICH THE LAW OF MARIOTTE IS APPLICABLE EXPERIMENTS TO BE HEREAFTER DESCRIBED HAVE SHOWN THAT THE DRIVINGPOWER MAY BE VARIED BETWEEN WIDE LIMITS WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY SENSIBLE VARIATION OF SPEED THE FINAL ADJUSTMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT TO THE NORMAL VELOCITY REQUIRED IS MOREOVER EASILY EFFECTED BY RAISING OR LOWERING THE CUP WHILE IT IS RUNNING FOR WHICH PURPOSE THE LOWER END OF THE UPRIGHT SPINDLE S IS SUPPORTED IN THE AXIS OF AN ADJUSTING SCREW E AS WILL BE SEEN BY INSPECTION OF PLATE XXIX FIG 1 BANGE OF POWER INCREASEDTHE RANGE OF POWER THROUGH WHICH UNIFORM ROTATION CAN BE OBTAINED MAY BE FURTHER INCREASED BY AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH IS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIX FIGS 2 AND 6 AND WHICH CONSISTS IN ARRESTING THE LIQUID PROJECTED OVER THE EDGE OF THE CUP BY A BELT OF FIXED VANES M WHENCE IT DROPS THROUGH THE ZONE OF ROTATING RADIAL VANES L WHICH AGAIN IMPART TANGENTIAL MOTION TO IT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE SUPERFLUOUS DRIVINGPOWER OF THE CUP OF WHICH THEY FORM PART IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO ADD THAT THESE FIXED AND ROTATING VANES ONLY INCREASE THE RANGE OF POWER OF THE INSTRUMENT WITHOUT IN ANY QWAY AFFECTING ITS RATE OF ROTATION AND THAT A SECOND SET OF FIXED AND ROTATING VANES MIGHT BE ADDED WITH THE SAME EFFECT AS THE FIRST ALTHOUGH THE ROTATING CUP REPRE SENTED INF PLATE XXIX FIGS 2 AND 6 IS NOT PROVIDED WITH THE AUTOMATIC DIP IT IS EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT THE FIXED AND MOVEABLE VANES DO NOT PRECLUDE THAT ARRANGEMENT WHICH IS ONLY DISPENSED WITH IN SUCH CASES WHERE GREAT UNIFORMITY OF MOTION IS NOT REQUIRED AN INTERESTING APPLICATION OF SUCH A LIQUID GYROMETER AS THIS INSTRUMENT MAY APPROPRIATELY BE CALLED WOULD BE THAT OF OBTAINING SYNCHRONOUS MOTION AT DIFFERENT PLACES CONNECTED BY A TELEGRAPHIC WIRE FOR PHILOSOPHICAL OR TELEGRAPHIC PURPOSES BUT IN ORDER TO TEST ITS FITNESS FOR SUCH PURPOSES I HAVE CONSTRUCTED A CLOCK OF WHICH IT CON STITUTES THE REGULATING PRINCIPLE THEMOVING POWER BEING OBTAINED BYELECTROMAGNETISM CLOCK REGULATED BY LIQUID IN ROTATIONTHIS CLOCK IS REPRESENTED BY PLATE XXX FIGS 7  8 AND CONSISTS  OF THREE PRINCIPAL PARTS MDCCCLXVI 4 X664 MR C W SIEMENS ON UNIFORM ROTATION 1 THE PEDESTAL CONTAININGW A BATTERY OF TWO MARIE DAVYS ELEMENTS SUITABLY ARRANGED 2 THE BODY OF THE CLOCK WITH SIDES FORMED OF PLATE GLASS CONTAINING AN ELECTROMAGNET BY WHICH ROTATORY MOTION IS IMPARTED TO AN IRON BAR OR KEEPER FIXED UPON THE VERTICAL MAIN AXIS WHICH PASSES INTO 3 THE REGULATING CHAMBER CONSISTING OF A CLOSE CYLINDRICAL GLASS VESSEL WITH DOMED GLASS TOP CONTAINING THE ROTATING CUP AND A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF PARAFFIN OIL WHICHFLUID IS PARTICULARLY APPLICABLE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS PERFECT FLUIDITY AND NONAFFINITY FOR THE MATE RIALS COMPOSING THE REGULATOR THE REGULATING CUP IS IN THIS INSTANCE FORMED OF VULCANITE AND IS SUSPENDED FROM THE TOP OF THE VERTICAL AXIS BY MEANS OF A SPIRAL SPRING WHICH BEING FIXED AT BOTH ENDS NOT ONLY SUPPORTS THE WEIGHT OF THE CUP BUT ACTS ALSO AS A TORSIONAL SPRING ENABLING THE CUP TO DESCEND UPON ITS HELICAL CENTRAL GUIDE WHENEVER AN INCREASE OF DRIVINGPOWER CALLS INTO EXISTENCE ITS EQUIVALENT OF TORSIONAL RESISTANCE THE RINGS OF STATIONARY AND ROTATING VANES ARE DISPENSED WITH IN THIS INSTANCE BECAUSE NO GREAT VARIATIONS IN THE DRIVINGPOWER ARE CONTEMPLATED THE ELECTROMAGNET ACTS BY ATTRACTION OF THE ARMATURE DURING A SMALL PORTION OF ITS ROTATION AND ONE CONTACT ONLY IS REQUIRED WHICH IS SO ARRANGED THAT NO DESTRUCTION OF THE METALLIC SURFACES CAN ARISE THROUGH THE DISCHARGE OF EXTRACURRENT SPARKS WHICH LATTER ARE RECEIVED BY AN ELASTIC POINT OF PLATINUM SLIGHTLY IN ADVANCE OF THE PROPER CONTACT SURFACE AND MOVED BY THE SAME EXCENTRIC BY THIS SIMPLE ARRANGEMENT THE USUAL DIFFICULTY ATTENDING DRY CONTACTS IS AVOIDED AND A CONTINUED ACTION OF THE INSTRUMENT ENSURED A TRAIN OF REDUCING WHEELS COMMUNICATES THE MOTION OF THE CUPSPINDLE TO HANDS UPON THE FACE OF THE CLOCK WHICH RECORD HOURS AND MINUTES IN THE USUAL MANNER THE DIAMETER OF THE ROTATING CUP BEING 0040

INSTRUMENT WITH UNCERTAINTY WHEN IT WAS RECOLLECTED THAT NO ALLOWANCE HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE APERTURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP LEAVING A PORTION OF THE ROTATING LIQUID WITHOUT AN EXTERNAL SUPPORT CORRECTION FOR LOWER ORIFICE OF CMPF WE ASSUME FOR INSTANCE THAT THE SIDES OF THE CUP WERE CYLINDRICAL AND MERELY DESCENDED BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID WITHOUT CLOSING IN AT THE BOTTOM WE SHOULD FIND THAT BY ROTATION OF THIS CYLINDER SUPPOSING THE INNER SURFACE TO BE ROUGH OR ARMED WITH RADIAL PROJECTIONS THE LIQUID WOULD RISE ON THE CIR CUMFERENCE ABOVE THE EXTERNAL LEVEL OF SURFACE BUT WOULD ALSO FORM A DEPRESSION OR VORTEX IN THE CENTRE OF ROTATION THE SURFACE OF THE ROTATING LIQUID WOULD BE THAT PROMR C IW SIEMENS ON UNIFORM ROTATION 665 DUCED BY THE ROTATION OF A VERTICAL PARABOLA AS REPRESENTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING DIAGRAM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE HYDROSTATIC EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE ROTATING COLUMN AND THE EXTERNAL LIQUID IT IS NECESSARY THAT ITS MEAN HEIGHT OF COLUMN SHOULD REMAIN THE SAME OR THAT THE PLANE OF EXTERNAL LIQUID LEVEL SHOULD DIVIDE THE SOLID FIGURE COMPRISED BETWEEN THE CYLINDER AND THE CURVE OF ROTATION INTO EQUAL PARTS IN ORDER TO REALIZE THESE CONDITIONS EXPERI MENTALLY IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE LOWER PORTION OF THE ROTATING CYLINDER WITH AN EASY FITTING AND BALANCED PISTON WITHOUT WHICH CIRCULAR CURRENTS WOULD BE PRODUCED WITHIN THE ROTATING LIQUID DE SCENDING BY FORCE OF GRAVITY AT THE SIDES AND RISING AGAIN IN THE CENTRE AND MAR THE RESULT THE BODY COMPRISED BETWEEN A PARABOLOID OF THE HEIGHT AH AND A CYLINDER IS HOWEVER DIVIDED EQUALLY BY A HORIZONTAL PLANE CUTTING IT AT THE DISTANCE OF  FROM THE EDGE OR AT H 293H FIG 3 0  IR F A I III I11I   XJIL  XI IL 1 FROM THE APEX THE FORM OF THE CURVE DEPENDS UPON THE ANGULAR VELOCITY ALONE AND WOULD REMAIN THE SAME IF THE UPPER DIAMETER OF THE TUBE WERE TO BE INCREASED ONLY THE CURVE WOULD IN THAT CASE HAVE TO BE CONTINUED UNTIL IT MET THE SIDES AS SHOWN BY DOTTED LINES AND TO THE EXTENT OF THESE PROLONGATIONS THE LIQUID WOULD BE RAISED HIGHER ABOVE THE EXTERNAL LEVEL WITHOUT PRODUCING A CORRESPONDING DEPRESSION IN THE CENTRE OF ROTATION IT FOLLOWS THAT THE APERTURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ROTATING CUP CAUSES A VORTEX OR DEPRESSION OF THE APEX OF THE CURVE OF ROTATION BELOW THE EXTERNAL LIQUID TO THE EXTENT OF 293 PART OF THE HEIGHT DUE TO ITS OWN DIAMETER AND TO

REVOLUTIONS PER SECOND 40VR OR 1 REVOLUTION PER SECOND LESS THAN THE ACTUAL SPEED THIS REMAINING EXCESS OF THE ACTUAL OVER THE CALCULATED VELOCITY OF THE CUP IS RATHER MORE THAN WHAT MAY BE FAIRLY ATTRIBUTED TO ERROR OF MEASUREMENTS AND APPEARS TO BE DUE TO ADHESION OF A FILM OF LIQUID WHICH MAY BE ESTIMATED AT NEARLY 25 MILLIMETRE THICKNESS TO THE INNER SIDES AND EDGE OF THE CUP WHEREBY ITS EFFECTUAL DIMENSIONS ARE PROPORTIONATELY REDUCED FOR A UNI FORM SPEED THIS ERROR MUST BE A CONSTANT QUANTITY WHICH CANNOT AFFECT THE WORKING OF THE INSTRUMENT INJURIOUSLY SO LONG AS THE OTHER CONDITIONS ARE SUCH AS TO PRODUCE UNIFORM ROTATION THE DISCREPANCY IS DIMINISHED BY INCREASING THE DIMENSIONS OF THE CUP AND ITS AMOUNT IS SUCH THAT THE COMPENSATION IS EFFECTED UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES BY ONE OR TWO TURNS OF THE REGULATING SCREW SUPPORTING THE VERTICAL SPINDLE WHEN THE REGULATION OF THE CUP IS ONCE EFFECTED IT CONTINUES TO ROTATE AT A REMARKABLY UNIFORM RATE CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE AFFECTS THE DENSITY OF THE LIQUID CONSIDERABLY BUT DOES NOT INFLUENCE THE RATE OF THE CUP OTHERWISE THAN INASMUCH AS IT AFFECTS THE LEVEL IN THE CUPCHAMBER RISING WITH INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE PROPORTIONATELY TO THE DEPTH OF LIQUID IT CONTAINS WHICH CHANGE IS INCONSIDERABLE THE LINEAL DIMENSIONS OF THE CUP AND THE LENGTH OF THE SUSPENDING SPRING WILL ALSO INCREASE ALL TENDING TO LOWER THE RATE WITH INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE LENGTH OF THE UPRIGHT CUPSPINDLE INCREASES WITH INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE AND BY REGULATING THE LENGTH AND COMPOSITION OF THAT SPINDLE PROPERLY ENTIRE COMPENSATION FOR CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE IS EFFECTED THE CUPCHAMBER BEING ENTIRELY CLOSED AGAINST THE ATMOSPHERE NO FAULT CAN ARISE THROUGH EVAPORATION OR DISPERSION OF THE LIQUID WITHIN MODERATE PERIODS OF TIME IN THE CASE OF THE CLOCK UNDER CONSIDERATION NO COMPENSATION FOR CHANGE OF TEMPERA TURE WAS PROVIDED NOR IS THE CUP ENTIRELY BALANCED BY THE SPRING YET ITS RATE IS AS UNIFORM AS THAT OF THE COMMON CLOCK WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN COMPARED BUT IN ORDER TO TEST THE REGULATINGPOWER OF THE INSTRUMENT THE DRIVINGPOWER WAS VARIED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF ARTIFICIAL

WEAK PRODUCING A DECREASE OFWSPEED WITH INCREASE QF POWER A MORE CAREFUL ADJUSTMENT OF THE SPRING WOULD IMPROVE THESE RESULTS WHICH SUFFICE HOWEVER TO PROVE THE CAPABILITIES OF THE INSTRUMENT IT APPEARS AT FIRST SIGHT AS THOUGH THE FRICTION OF THE CUP UPON THE THREADS OF THE SCREW MUST INTERFERE WITH ITS AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT BUT THIS IS PRACTICALLY NOT THE CASE OWING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SMALL FLUCTUATIONS IN THE RESISTANCE CONTINUALLY OCCUR CAUSING TORSIONAL OSCILLATIONS OF THE CUP THE MEAN OF WHICH MUST BE ITS TRUE POSITION NOTWITHSTANDING FRICTION WHICH FRICTION MOREOVER IS REDUCED TO A MINIMUM OWING TO THE SUSPENSION OF THE WEIGHT BY THE SPRING ANOTHER INTERESTING QUALITY OF THE GYROMETRIC CUP IS ITS COMPARATIVE INDIFFERENCE TO A VERTICAL POSITION IT MAY INDEED BE TIPPED VERY CONSIDERABLY WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE UNIFORM OVERFLOW ALL ROUND AND THE TIME OF ITS ROTATIONS IS DIMINISHED ONLY IN THE RATIO OF THE SQUARE ROOTS OF THE VERTICAL MEAN HEIGHTS OR IT IS N NRV1H VH COSF OR FOR A TIPPING ANGLE F330 D N1 10007 SHOWING THAT NO PARTICULAR CARE IS REQUISITE TO PLACE THE INSTRUMENT UPON A HORIZONTAL FOUNDATION GYROMETRIC GOVERNORTHE MOST USEFUL PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THIS INSTRUMENTIS THAT OF REGULATING THE POWER AND VELOCITY OF STEAMENGINES A CUP OF VERY LARGE DIMEN SIONS PROVIDED WITH SEVERAL BELTS OF CHECKVANES AND WITH THE AUTOMATIC DIP ARRANGEMENT MIGHT BE CONCEIVED WHICH BEING CONNECTED BY GEARING WITH THE MAIN SHAFT OF AN ENGINE WOULD LIMIT ITS VELOCITY BY ABSORBING DIRECTLY ALL ITS SURPLUS POWER  THIS SUR PLUS POWER WOULD APPEAR IN THE CUPCHAMBER INTHE FORM OF MOLECULAR MOTION OR HEATS668 MR C W SIEMENS ON UNIFORM IOTATION AND WOULD HAVE TO BE GOT RID OF BY THE APPLICATION OF COOLING AGENTS IF THE NATURAL DIS PERSION OF HEAT BY RADIATION WOULD NO LONGER SUFFICE TO KEEP DOWN THE TEMPERATURE THIS WOULD HOWEVER BE A WASTEFUL PROCEEDING AND IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO OPERATE NOT UPON THE POWER PRODUCED BUT RATHER UPON THE SOURCE OF POWER BY RENDERING IT ALWAYS EQUAL TO THE ACCIDENTAL RESISTANCE OR LOAD IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN UNIFORM VELOCITY THE ARRANGEMENT ADAPTED FOR THIS PURPOSE IS REPRESENTED BY PLATE XXIX FIGS 2 3 4 5  6 S IS THE MAIN

THE ROCKINGFRAME I IS CONNECTED BY A ROD R TO A BELLCRANK LEVER 0 WHICH IS FASTENED UPON THE SPINDLE OF THE STEAMREGULATING OR THROTTLEVALVE V BUT THE HORIZONTAL ARM OF THE LEVER 0 CARRIES A WEIGHT P WHICH BEING ACTED UPON BY GRAVITY TENDS TO OPEN THE VALVE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO FORCE THE ROCKINGFRAME I WITH ITS PLANETWHEELS G AND G ROUND THE VERTICAL AXIS THIS PRESSURE IS RESISTED ON THE ONE HAND BY THE TEETH OF THE PINION F WHICH CAN ONLY YIELD IN THE RATIO IMPOSED BY THE ROTATING CUP C AND ON THE OTHER HAND BY THE TEETH OF THE INVERTED WHEEL E WHICH LATTER BEING DRIVEN ROUND BY THE ENGINE IN THE DIRECTION CONTRARY TO THE EFFORT PRODUCED BY THE WEIGHT P CAUSES THE LATTER TO BE CONTINUALLY RAISED IF THE ENGINE SHOULD SUCCEED IN RAISING THE WEIGHT P SAY 100 MILLIMS WHILE THE REGULATING CUP YIELDS ALSO TO THE EXTENT OF 100 MILLIMS THEN THE LEVER 0 AND WITH IT THE REGULATING VALVE V WILL RETAIN THEIR RELATIVE POSITION BUT IF THE ENGINE SHOULD RAISE IT SAY 95 OR 105 MILLIMS WHILE THE CUP YIELDS 100 MILLIMS THEN THE VALVE WILL BE EITHER OPENED OR CLOSED BY 5 MILLIMS AND THE ENGINE WILL BE URGED OR CHECKED AS THE CASE MAY BE TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO MAKE ITS REVO LUTIONS COINCIDE AGAIN ABSOLUTELYFWITH THOSE OF THE REGULATING CUP THE DRIVINGPOWER OF THE CUP IS LIMITED BY THE WEIGHT P AND MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A CONSTANT REGULATED QUANTITY ALTHOUGH IT IS DERIVED INDIRECTLY FROM THE ENGINE BUT WHEN EVER THE VALVE HAS TO BE OPENED OR CLOSED A RESISTANCE ARISES WHICH GOES EITHER IN DIMI NUTION OF OR IN ADDITION TO THE WEIGHT P AND THE POWER OF THE CUP MUST BE SUCH THAT ITS SPEED REMAINS SUFFICIENTLY UNIFORM UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THESE OCCASIONAL VARIATIONS BY MEANS OF THE AUTOMATIC DIP ARRANGEMENT IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN PER FECT UNIFORMITY NOTWITHSTANDING THESE IRREGULARITIES IN THE DRIVINGPOWER BUT IN THE CASE OF STEAMENGINE GOVERNORS THIS ARRANGEMENT IS DISPENSED WITH FOR THE SAKE OF A MORE IMMEDIATE ACTION UPON THE VALVE AT THE MOMENT WHEN A DIFFERENTIAL VELOCITY ARISES SUPPOSING THAT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF OCCASIONAL VARIATION OF SPEED IS TO BE 1 PER CENT AND THAT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE CUP ARE AS FOLLOWS DIAMETER AT UPPER RIM 200 MILLIMS DIAMETER OF RIM ABOVE THE LIQUID 200 MILLIMS DIAMETER OF ORIFICE AT BOTTOM OF CUP       90 MILLIMS WE FIND THE AVAIKABLE POWER OF THE INSTRUMENT IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER 0 W SIEMENS ON UNIFORM ROTATION 66 THE NORMAL SPEED OF A CUP OF THESE DIMENSIONS IS ACCORDING TO OUR FORMULA V19600 X 2001 5 N  31OO93X 3 31 REVOLUTIONS PER SECOND 2007R THE HEIGHT TO WHICH THE LIQUID IS RAISED BY ROTATION INCREASES IN THE SQUARE RATIO OF THE SPEED OF ROTATION THE INCREASE OF HEIGHT DUE TO 1 PER CENT INCREASE OF SPEED WOULD THEREFORE RESULT FROM THE FOLLOWING PROPORTION LOOV LOLVVHVH OR THE HEIGHT DUE TO THE INCREASED SPEED H204 MILLIMS THAT IS TO SAY THE LIQUID WOULD BE RAISED 4 MILLIMS ABOVE THE BRIM OF THE CUP WHICH BEING AN UNBALANCED COLUMN WILL PRODUCE AN UPWARD FLOW OF THE LIQUID IN THE CUP AS EXPRESSED BY THE WELLKNOWN FORMULA VV2GH OR H BEING IN THIS CASE 4 MILLIMS WE HAVE V 280 METRE FLOW PER SECOND WHICH IF MULTIPLIED BY THE LEAST SECTIONAL AREA AT THE ENTRANCE INTO THE

LIQUID A VELOCITY OF 6212 5 METRESPER SECOND THESE ACCELERATIONS REPRESENT A POWER WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FORMULA VC2 H2G IS EQUAL TO THE SAME LIQUID BEING LIFTED FOR V2 1 METRES  TO 225 METRE HEIGHT AND FOR V205   TO 320 METRE HEIGHT IN THE CUP IT WAS LIFTED TO 200 METRE HEIGHT MAKING A TOTAL LIFT  TO 745 METRE HEIGHT IF THE LIQUID EMPLOYED IS WATER THE 1 6 LITRE REPRESENTS 16 KILOGRAM AND THE RESIST ANCE PRODUCED BY 1 PER CENT INCREASE OF VELOCITY IS 16 X A745 12 KILOGRAMMETRES PER SECOND670 MR 0 WO SIEMENS 0N UNIFORMI ROTATION WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FORCING A VALVE ROD OR LEVER THROUGH ONE DECIMETRE SPACE IN TEN SECONDS AGAINST A RESISTANCE OF 120 KILOGRAMS THIS FORCE EXCEEDS BY FAR WHAT IS USUALLY REQUIRED OF A GOVERNOR AND FITS THE NEW INSTRUMENT FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OBJECTS WHICH HITHERTO COULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS REGULATING THE POWER OF ENGINES BY THE LINK MOTION OR OTHER VARIABLE EXPANSION GEAR WHEREBY A CONSIDERABLE SAVING OF FUEL MAY BE EFFECTED OR MOVING THE GATE OF A WATERWHEEL THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF THIS GOVERNOR IS HOWEVER THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH A READJUSTMENT BETWEEN POWER AND LOAD OF AN ENGINE IS EFFECTED EXPERIMENT HASPROVED THAT TWOTHIRDS OF THE TOTAL LOAD UPON AN ENGINE MAY BE SUDDENLY THROWN OFF WITHOUT PRO DUACNG ANY VISIBLE CHANGE IN ITS ROTATION IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE VARIATION OF 1 PER CENT WHICH WAS ASSUMED IN CALCULATING THE POWER OF THE INSTRUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE SHORT PERIOD OF TEN SECONDS DURING WHICH THE READJUSTMENT OF THE VALVE IS EFFECTED AFTER WHICH THE CUP AND WITH IT THE ENGINE RETURNS TO ITS NORMAL RATE OF ROTATION BUT AN INCREASE OR DECREASE OF SPEED OF 1 PER CENT DURING TEN SECONDS IS SO SMALL A TOTAL AMOUNT THAT IT IS NOT PERCEPTIBLE TO THE EYE AND MAY BE REGARDED AS NONEXISTING FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES A UNIFORM VELOCITY OF ENGINES SUCH AS IS SECURED BY THIS INSTRUMENT IS OF CONSIDER ABLE PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE IN SPINNING GRINDING CORN AND OTHER MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY PREVENTS BREAKAGES AND IRREGULARITIES IN THE QUALITY OF THE WORK PRO DUCED BUT IT ENABLES MANUFACTURERS TO ATTAIN TO THE MAXIMUM SPEED AT WHICH THEIR WORK CAN BE PRODUCED IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE ROTATING CUP IS NOT SENSITIVE TO TIPPING A CIRCUMSTANCE RENDERING THE GYROMETRIC GOVERNOR ALSO APPLICABLE TO MARINE ENGINES WHICH ARE MUCH IN NEED OF A MEANS FOR MAINTAINING A UNIFORM SPEED PARTICULARLY WHERE THE SCREW PROPELLER IS USED WHICH IN BEING RAISED BY WAVES ABOVE THE WATER ALLOWS THE ENGINE TO FLY OFF AT A DANGEROUS SPEED THE GYROMETRIC CUP APPEARS THEREFORE TO BE EQUALLY

parts of which seem to have been so delicately adjusted to each other that the awful strain to which the whole is now subjected is distributed among the several members in exact pro portion to their ability to bear Other na tions are learning this lesson in the hard school of experience and they are paying tuition in blood and treasure Fortunately for us it may be learned by observation as well as by experiment T C MENDENHALL November 9 1915 HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE OHIO ACAD EMY OF SCIENCE TWENTYFIVE years ago the first decisive steps were taken looking toward the organi zation of an Ohio Academy of Science At the annual meeting of the Biological Club of the State University held November 3 1891 the retiring president made a short address in which he said substantially There is need of one institution in Ohio to the organization of which our club should di rect its combined energy and influence This is a state academy of science If local clubs and societies of science are beneficial the reasons that make them so apply with greater force to a state organization Who can estimate the inspiration the stimulus to research and investigation that such an in stitution would provoke In a great agri cultural state like Ohio a deep abiding and constantly growing interest will ever be taken in the sciences of geology botany and chemistry for these constitute the very foundation the body and bones of any ra tional basis of practical knowledge regard ing soils and the various crops that grow thereon But our State Academy would not be confined to the sciences that relate so directly to soils and crops All branches of biology as well as physics chemistry mathematics anthropology meteorology economics sociology etc everything that contributes to the sum total of scientific knowledge should find a place The initial steps toward the founding of such an acad emy should be taken by this club and tonight This can be done by the appoint ment of a committee which should ener getically push the matter by preparing a program for a meeting and issuing a call to all interested to assist in the organization In pursuance with this declaration the club appointed a committee consisting of D S Kellicott W A Kellerman and the speaker to take such measures as in their judgment were deemed best to carry into effect the wishes of the Biological Club The committee soon secured the promise of hearty cooperation from many of the most prominent scientists in Ohio and issued a call for a meeting to be held in Columbus December 31 1891 The meeting took place at the date named and appointed a committee on organiza tion consisting of W A Kellerman of the Ohio State University E W Claypole of Buchtel College and Henry Snyder of Miami University While the committee just named were preparing a constitution and bylaws papers were read by Dr A M Bleilie E E Bogue J M Bradford H E Chapin H J Detmers W A Kellerman D S Kellicott H A Weber W C Warner and A A Wright After the adoption of a brief but compre hensive constitution and a few simple by laws the organization was completed by the election of the following officers to serve the 890 SCIENCESCIENCE first year President E W Claypole Buchtel College Akron Vicepresidents A A Wright Oberlin and Ellen E Smith Lake Erie Seminary Painesville Secre tary William R Lazenby Ohio State Uni versity Columbus and A D Selby Treasurer Columbus Ohio Elected as members of the Executive Committee were E T Nelson Ohio Wesleyan Delaware and A D Cole then of Denison University Granville It should be noted that of the seven elected officers only two the secretary and treasurer were residents of Columbus and connected with the state university I mention this to show that from the very outset the academy has been a statewide institution and in no way restricted or limited to any one section of the state At tention is also called to the fact that the charter members of the academy fiftynine in number included mathematicians chem ists physicists in generous proportions It was also quite representative of the educational institutions of the state that were interested in science Besides the state university which naturally had the largest number the following universities and colleges were represented Buchtel Cincinnati Denison Miami Mount Union Oberlin Ohio Ohio Wesleyan Otterbein Starling Medical Western Reserve and Wilmington Lake Erie Seminary and the State Experiment Station as well as the high schools of Alliance Cincinnati Cleve land Columbus Chillicothe Dayton De fiance Geneva Kent Portsmouth San dusky and Tiffin were likewise represented At the first meeting the secretary was in structed to secure articles of incorporation and to publish the constitution and bylaws together with a list of the officers and members In accordance with the above instruc tions a certificate of incorporation was duly filed with the Secretary of State on March 12 1892 This certificate bore the following names as incorporators of the Ohio State Academy of Science W A Kellerman P M Webster A D Selby W C Werner E E Bogue and W R Lazenby Of these incorporators Professors Kellerman and Bogue have passed away The academy held its first field meeting in Summit County on June 3 and 4 1892 the headquarters being at what was then Buchtel College in the city of Akron The program for the fieldday included an excursion by steamer to Long Lake and the day was spent in and about the attrac tive Lake District of Summit County The botanists observed the rich and varied plant societies of the swamps and the geol ogists were interested in the great moraines to which in part at least the swamps ponds and lakes owe their origin In the evening a reception was held in the gymnasium of Buchtel College at which the visitors were welcomed by the mayor of Akron the president of the college Dr 0 Cone and the president of the Akron Scientific Club The next day at an early hour the mem bers and visitors set out for Cuyahoga Falls where they were cordially welcomed They were conducted some three miles through the postglacial gorge of the Cuyahoga River This excursion was equally interesting and profitable The geologists and botan ists and entomologists improved the oppor tunity and added to their stores of scien tific facts After the passing of a quarter of a cen tury I can look back upon this as one of the redletter days of my life What was called on the program the first annual meeting although in reality the second was held in Columbus December 29 and 30 1892 At this meeting twentyfive papers were read The papers were for the most part on some phase of botany geology DECEMBER 24 1915 891N S VOL XLII No 1095 and entomology Perhaps the most signif icant action at this meeting was a brief re port of the Committee on Publications which announced that it had selected the Journal of the Cincinnati Society of Nat ural History and the technical series of Bulletins of the Ohio Experiment Station as the official organs of the academy until better arrangements can be made At the close of this second annual meet ing although in reality the end of the first year of the existence of the academy the total membership was as follows Annual m6mbers 116of which number 59 were charter members and one life member Mr Emerson McMillin who at this early day became a generous patron Having dwelt in some detail upon the founding and early history of the academy I shall treat its subsequent career and ac complishments more briefly Statistics are usually wearisome but in the interests of history they can not be wholly avoided What may be termed the annual mem bership of the academy has increased from 59 charter members in 1891 to 234 mem bers in 1915 About one fifth of the mem bership reside outside of Ohio and are found in 15 different states besides the Dis trict of Columbia Hawaii and Canada The Ohio residents are found in more than 50 counties of the state To illustrate the regularity of growth in numbers the fifth year the membership was 157 tenth 173 fifteenth 179 twentieth 196 twentyfifth 234 As to attendance one can not speak con fidently for no records have been kept On the average I should say that one third of the resident membership have attended the annual meetings As to place fourteen of the twentyfive annual meetings have been held in Columbus two in Granville two in Cincinnati two in Cleveland one each in Oxford Delaware Akron and Oberlin Summer meetings have been held in well selected places in the following counties Summit Hocking Licking Erie Butler Knox Montgomery Franklin Ottawa and Wayne Several of these were joint meet ings with other organizations For in stance in Butler County with the Indiana Academy of Science in Franklin County with the American Association for the Ad vancement of Science the summer meeting of 1899 at PutinBay with the Ohio Teachers Association and in Sandusky County with the same organization These delightful meetings were held each year for the first ten years in the life of the acad emy For some reason unknown to me they then ceased Would it not be well to renew them As summer schools are now held at many points in Ohio it might be ad visable to arrange a meeting of a day or two with the scientific departments of some one of these schools The papers presented during the twenty five years number 1124 or an average of 45 for each meeting The range in number is from 10 read at the first meeting to 64 read at the fifteenth At the twentyfourth meeting the number was 61 and at the twentyfifth it was 58 Cloud and sunshine joy and grief are common contrasts in our life We experi enced these contrasts at the eighth annual meeting The first serious break in the ranks of our membership had then occurred Two of our ablest members were missing We grieved that Dr Kellicott had been stricken by death and that Dr Claypole had left Ohio to spend the remainder of his days in the more genial climate of Cali fornia At the same time we rejoiced that one who had already proven himself a friend should modestly announce that he had given the academy 250 to be expended in ways best suited to promote scientific research with the further statement that such a sum 892 SCIENCESCIENCE might be given annually provided the use made of the money was satisfactory and it proved convenient for the donor to spare it We may assume that these conditions have been fulfilled for from that day to this or for eighteen successive years this gener ous gift has been received It has come to us quietly promptly and without solici tation during all this time It has been administered in the same quiet way and not one penny has been used for anything except to aid in research or the publication of its results The influence of this gift has been as gentle and persuasive as the spring sun shine or summer shower Nearly a score of special papers have been prepared and pub lished by the academy through its aid As many more have been published elsewhere All honor to this scholarly efficient large hearted highspirited man I trust he be lieves that the reward of a good deed is to have done it if not I dont know how he is to be paid We are here today in a spirit of con gratulation We congratulate our academy upon what it has accomplished We con gratulate Emerson McMillin on what he has done for the academy We congratulate the universities col leges and high schools of Ohio that so large a number of their instructional force are active workers in our academy Our an nual meetings have confirmed and strength ened a spirit of good will between the edu cational institutions of the state They have cultivated the amenities and devel oped a feeling of brotherhood among our members Our academy since its inception has stood for good scholarship good fellow ship and good citizenship The essentials of a great landscape are unity and variety These are likewise the great attributes of an association for the promotion of science Unity in the spirit and ideals of the work to be accomplished and variety infinite vari ety in the means by which these ideals may be developed We come together on the basis of commanding interests and diverse experiences This devotion to the varied phases of science detracts nothing from the pursuit of the older humanities but adds materially to the effectiveness of any study that puts the student in closer touch with his environmentin closer touch with na tureand natures law This spirit was in Orton and Kellicott and Claypole who were among the founders of the academy What a fine influence these men exerted What fine lives they led It was a happy blending of the strenuous the simple and the abundant life Strenuous because in addition to the en forced and exacting labors of a teacher were added the selfimposed tasks of the investi gator simple because they lived close to nature and her laws were the rule and guide of their daily conduct They had neither time nor means for luxury And most of all their lives were abundant abundant in opportunity abundant in accomplishment abundant in honors abundant in friend ship Demanding little they received much They are of those who losing their lives save them We are together to celebrate an epoch not alone in the promotion of science but in the attainment of the ideals of education ideals for which the academy will stand in the future as in the past WILLIAM R LAZENBY OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY THE NAVAL CONSULTING BOARD OF THE UNITED STATES1 THE socalled fivemillion laboratory proposed by the Naval

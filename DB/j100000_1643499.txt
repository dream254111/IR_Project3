July 10 at the age of eightynine years Dr Jacobi was born of Jewish parents in the village of Hartum Westphalia on May 6 1830 His people were not welltoAdo his edu cation was accomplished through privation and struggle but he early acquired a knowledge of Latin and after the usual courses of instruc tion in the village school and the Gymnasium at Minden he went to the University of Greifswald in 1847 at the age of seventeen to matriculate as a istudent of Oriental languages Becoming interested in medicine he turned to anatomy and physiology Following the peri patetic plan of the German student he pro ceeded to Gottingen where he came under Frerichs and Woehler winding up his course at Bonn where he graduated in 1851 with a Latin dissertation Cogitationes de vita rerum naturalium which has considerable philo sophic depth In the meantime the Revolu tion of 1848 had broken out and run its course and in this brief drive for liberty Jacobi with Ferdinand Freiligrath Karl Marx Carl Schurz and others had been a leading spirit When he went to Berlin to take his state examina tion he was apprehended by the Prussian au thorities imprisoned for a year and a half in a German fortress at Cologne convicted of lese majeste and again held in detention for six months at Minden In 1853 through the friendship of his jailer he managed to escape took ship at Hamburg and after some vicissi tudes in England and New England settled down to practise at 20 Howard Street New York Here beginning with such modest fees as 25 and 50 cents for office and house visits five to ten dollars for obstetric cases he soon managed to make a living In the first year of his practise he made 97325 During the next year 1854 he invented a laryngoscope of his own which was unfortunately not ever pat ented or made public before the appearance of Manuel Garcias instrument 1855 By 1857 Jacobi was lecturing on pediatrics in the Col lege of Physicians and Surgeons of New York This was the starting point of clinical and scientific pediatrics in this country In this branch of medicine Jacobi had only one other American colleague in nosense a rival or competitor the devoted and unworldly J Lewis Smith whose famous treatise of 1869 passed through eight editions In 1860 Jacobi was called to the first special chair of diseases of children in the New York Medical College in 1861 Smith became clinical professor of pediatrics in the Bellevue Hospital College In 1865 Jacobi took the clinical chair of his subject in the medical department of the Uni versity of New York In 1870 he became clin ical professor of pediatrics in the College of Physicians and Surgeons 187099 Officially he taught pediatrics in New York for nearly half a century actually all his working life In 1862 Jacobi established a pediatric clinic in the New York Medical College Building in East 13th Street which ran for two years In this way bedside teaching in pediatrics ante dated bedside teaching in internal medicine in the United States Meanwhile Jacobi had been an active and brilliant contributor to medical literature In 1859 he published a volume of  Contributions to Midwifery and Diseases of Women and Children with Emil Noeggerath1 who was to be Jacobis coadjutor in founding the Amer ican Journal of Obstetrics 1862  During 18591903 Jacobi wrote much on diphtheria and published successive treatises on diseases of the larynx 1859 dentition and its derange ments 1862 infant diet 1872 diphtheria 1876 intestinal diseases of infancy and child hood 1887 diseases of the thymus gland 1889 and therapeutics of infancy and child I Author of the now wellestablished theory of the latency of gonorrhcea in unsuspected carriers 1872 which has been of great moment in the sci ence of causation of pelvic disease in women 102 SCIENCEAUGUST 1 1919 SCIENCE hood 18961903 The tendency of these books is mainly practical to spread the pedia tric doctrine as applied science The treatise on infantile therapeutics is in reality a trea tise on pediatrics summarizing the authors views and revealing his wide knowledge of the literature To the medical periodicals Jacobi contributed many papers including his more original observations of infantile disease His most enduring contributions to his science are perhaps the three monographs in the Gerhardt  Handbuch  on infant hygiene 1876 diph theria 1877 and dysentery 1877 These the products of a man approaching fifty have all the force and fire of youth To the history of pediatrics Jacobi contrilbuted the most im portant American papers notably his St Louis address 1904 two authoritative histories of American pediatrics 1902 1913 a history of cerebrospinal meningitis in America 1905 and a history of pediatrics in New York City 1917 In sixtysix years of active practise he wrote an enormous number of miscellanaeous papers of the most varied kind most of which have been gathere in eight volumes  Col lectanea Jacobi 1909 These include some of the wisest and wittiest discourses in med ical literature As a pendant to the festal volume presented to him on his seventieth birthday 1900 it had been proposed to com memorate his ninetieth birthday with another memorial volume containing a complete bib liography of his writings to be followed by a selection of his best utterances such as Camac has culled from the writings of Osler No more fitting tribute to Jacobis memory could now be made In 1873 Dr Jacobi married Miss Mary C Putnam who was one of the first lady gradu ates in medicine 1870 and became herself a famous physician Dr Jacobi was of short slight but elastic frame his whole person dominated by the large splendid head leonine magisterial with its crown of hair the living embodiment of some great highpriest of knowledge of old The earlier portraits betoken extraordinary vigor of mind and body and even in his de clining years his cheerful tenacitypf life was with him to the last There came the inevit able lines in the face which years and cu rious thought and suffering give but the expression of the wonderful eyes subtle hu morous pathetic the eyes of the physician who is also philosopher did not change He was largeminded bighearted intensely hu man his conversation flavored with delight ful banter the tricksy humors of dainty Ariel or frolic Puck With women and young peo ple in particular his captivating charm of manner was unfailing If it be true that the old are natural enemies of the young he was one of the delightful exceptions With his broad background of culture his knowledge and achievement he had ever a delicate ironic trait of genuine modesty with which any reference to his own performance was inevitably tinctured the modesty of those who in the words of the Italian poet con tinually compare themselves not with other men but with their own ideal of perfection In a private letter he mourns my constant routine work in daily practise for sixty years that kept me in solitude away from the good and great men ever away from music and literature and away from those who called me friend His fidelity to duty was that of Brownings Corregidor Yet he was a mem ber frequently president of many medical societies and a constant participant in their meetings It is characteristic of the man that he once gravely rebuked me for disinclination to attend such meetings although my excuse as a nonpractitioner was perfectly valid Characteristic also was his vein of thought spontaneous as a flight of birds with its omni present humor a trait which made for perfect poise and sanity His quaint remarks at an alumni dinner about the poultry in Lohengrin recall the wellknown witticism of Lady Duckle in Evelyn Innes At the age of eighty seven he wrote When old ladies believe in the efficacy of hot chamomile tea no matter whether they mean Ro man or vulgar flowers in fever and in belly ache you hope that not many of that class of old ladies are left I have survived them 103N S VOL L No 1283 As sometimes happens with those who have come to us bringing gifts in their hands Jacobi was in helpful unlifting citizenship an inspiring example He once said to me very simply  I am a Hebrew by race but not clannish not a sectarian His adaptation to environment was as in Oslers case that of a colonial or continental American In actual ity he belonged to the nobler antebellum gen eration which produced the  Lees Lincolns Shermans and Grants The fact was written in his face He had nothing either of the vieux bonze or of the smart metallic business man ner of the arriviste His civic courage was of the highest order Not even the offer of Henochs chair in Berlin could induce him to give up the ideals of his fiery youth or to desert the country of his adoption a sign that real character does not change Genio y figura hasta la muerte One was frequently im pressed with his facial likeness to the novelist Turgenieff who in a less personal and forth right way was also a protagonist of civil and personal liberty and in whom there was the same elusive irony and spontaneity of thought One recalls the immortal words pronounced by Renan in the Gare du Nord over the bier of the great Russian once defined as the best that human nature is capable of   I fat d une race par sa manibre de sentir et de peindre il appartenait a I humanite tout entiTre par

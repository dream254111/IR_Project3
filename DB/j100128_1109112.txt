j100128,Columbia Law Review,1109112,The Destruction of Municipal Corporations Where Contract Obligations Are Threatened,i246239,COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW seem to be an entirely unjustifiable limitation on the rule declared in the statute and logically repugnant to that rule but on the principle of interpreting statutes under the guidance of the common law the court would seem properly to require an explicit declaration from the legislature before abandoning the exception THE DFSTRUCTION OF MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS WHERE CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS ARE THREATENEDThe courts seem very cautious in conceding that the obligations of contracts can be impaired by legis lative action yet since the case of M1eriwefher v Garrelt i88c o02 U S 472 it appears to be settled that the legislature has this power when it is incidental to the abolition of a municipal corporation Be ing but a part of the machinery employed in carrying on the affairs of the State Laramie Co v Albany Co 1873 112 Mass 200 a muni cipal corporation is necessarily under the sole control of the legisla ture and it would be a usurpation of legislative functions for the courts to attempt to supervise that control Only the Constituticn can fix the limits of legislative activity The power of taxation has frequently been held to be a governmental function and within the control of the legislature It is held that this power can be controlled by contract so as to be within the protection of the constitution Von Hofnman v Civy of Quincy 1866 4 Wall 535 but it seems to be recognized that this is an anomalous line of decisions and the broad proposition that the State cannot surrender control of its inherent powers of government has been frequently affirmed Cooleys Const Lim 7th ed 395 It would seem therefore that unless a contract with a muni cipal corporation can be brought within the decisions on the power of taxation its obligations cannot be protected by the Constitution from the free exercise of legislative discretion and that if no relief for creditors is provided by the legislature the courts can give none This seems to have been the reasoning and the decision in Mfer riwelher v Garrett and it seems necessarily to involve a power in the legislature to impair the obligation of a contract though as in a recent case Ex parte Folsom 1904 13I Fed 496 the courts have frequently suggested that there can be no such power A distinc tion however has been drawn between the total annihilation of a municipal corporation and a mere change in its form and powers Where it has been merged with another corporation its debts follow and the merged corporation is responsible for them Mlobile v Wat son I886 II6 U S 289 So also if the old corporation continues to exist the legislature cannot relieve it of its debts or prevent their enforcement if there are officers and machinery enough to act Wolff v New Orleans i880 103 U S 358 and this was found to be the result in the principal case though the cfficers authorized to act were primarily officers of another corporation But if as in the lMer riwether case the corporation has been so completely absorbed back into the State as to leave no machinery or powers on which the court may attack its decree it would seem that creditors can hold the private property of the corporation and that beyond this they are helpless The feudal idea of a vested right in the exercise of the powers of government has not found favor in our courts 596

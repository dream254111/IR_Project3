STONE ROSCOE T HOLT SIDNEY ST F THAXTER THOMAS HUN WILLIAM D TURNER JOHN H WATSON JR CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE FEDERAL EMPLOYERS LIABILITY ACT  In pursuance of the recent policy of exploiting the long unexercised power  to regulate commerce    among the several states 1 Congress last year passed the Federal Employers Liability Act providing that every common carrier engaged in trade or comiimerce    between the several states    shall be liable to any of its employees or in case of his death to his personal representative    for all damages which may result from the negligence of any of its officers agents or employees   2 Almost simultaneously this statute has been held unconstitutional by two federal circuit courts Brooks v Southern Pac Co 148 Fed Rep 986 Circ Ct W D Ky Howard v Illinois Cent R R Co 148 Fed Rep 997 Circ Ct WV D Tenn WV D Each court rested its decision primarily on the ground that the Act is not a regulation of interstate commerce within the constitutional powers of Congress though each gave the alternative rea son that even if the Act does so regulate interstate commerce it also by its terms regulates purely intrastate commerce and constitutes one insep arable whole The latter objection is merely verbal and easily avoidable The former objection raises a question fundamentally important and em barrassingly difficult The answer to it seems indicated by practically no authority even approximately in point for the former disinclination of Congress to exercise its interstate commerce powers has allowed few adju dications on their scope The Safety Appliance Act3 the constitutionality of which seems to have been acquiesced in but not directly adjudged by the United States Supreme Court4 is a regulation as to cars actually moving interstate traffic to secure the safety of employees and travellers on inter state journeys  a very different sort of act from the one now in question 1 U S Const Art T  8 cl 3 See also cl I8 2 34

the same judge who decided the first of the present cases Moreover decisions as to the validity of state statutes regulating incidents of interstate commerce in the absence of congressional action6 and as to the power of Congress over foreign commerce7 have little value in determining the precise limits of Congress interstate commerce power These limits therefore can be discovered only by ascertaining from gen eral considerations what is interstate commerce and what constitutes a regulation of it Interstate commerce said Judge Field comprehends intercourse for the purposes of trade in any and all its forms including the transportation purchase sale and exchange of commodities    between citizens of different states 8 Now the trafficking of a common carrier in the labor of its employees is certainly not interstate commerce9 Consequently if the present enactment be a regulation of commerce it is so because it indirectly regulates the transportation or transit of persons or property betwveen the states9 Undoubtedly Congress may indirectly regulate interstate com merce by regulating its instrumentalities0 On the other hand the power does not apply to all the incidents to whiclh the commerce might give rise and to all contracts which might be made in the course of its transaction nor to its instrumentalities except as affecting thle interstate commerce itself 12 for then that power wouli be made to  embrace the entire sphere of mercantile activity in any way connected with trade between the states 1 Betwixt these two clear extremes there lies a shadowy region of doubt  The precise limit of the power of Congress    cannot be determined by the application of technical or definite rules The question can often be solved only by considering the true spirit and purpose of the Constitu tion and the practical results of the legislation in question 13 It is accord ingly important to bear in mind the fact that the interstate commerce power was granted to secure an interstate commerce unobstructed by invidious dis tinctions arising from local interests and subject only to uniform regulations14 Judged by these considerations the act in question seems wanting It dces not directly regulate interstate commerce it does not reguilate an instru mentality in a particular bearing substantially on interstate commerce it subserves no object sought through the interstate commiierce clause How can it fairly be said to render interstate transportation or transit safer or better On the contrary the whole scope and spirit of the law makes it transparent that the enactment actually results and was designed to result 5 See RECENT CASES P 499 6 See Peirce v Van Iusen 78 Fed Rep 693 698 7 See Prentice Fed Power over Carriers and Corp 48 221 8 See Welton v

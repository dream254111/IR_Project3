THE SHIRTWAIST MAKERS OF NEW YORK HELEN MAROT Womens Trade Union League New York City HE usual object of monographs on strikes which appear in economic journals is to state impartially both sides of the controversy so that students and a public more or less remote from labor struggles may estimate their merits Such monographs are presentations of welldefined facts which are reducible at times to mathematical certainties They recog nize that passionate human feeling has swayed action on both sides and the endeavor is to lift labor disputes from the heat of emotion to intellectual consideration These monographs may give correct estimates of strikes in industries thoroughly organ ized both as to capital and labor Strikes in such industries are often the result of bad business management or a slip in judg ment on one side or the other But the great number of strikes occur in industries imperfectly organized the passion or emo tion which swings the battle is as important a factor as is either an extortionate demand for wages or a flagrant exploitation of wage earners It is well that the public shall estimate this strike and that but to do so it must also understand the motive forces The present article does not attempt to estimate either the moral or the economic factors in the recent shirtwaistmakers strike of New York but to lay before the reader some of those motive forces which may be counted upon in strikes composed of like elements especially in strikes of women in unorganized trades The shirtwaistmakers general strike as it is called fol lowed an eleven years attempt to organize the trade The union had been unable during this time to affect to any appre ciable extent the conditions of work In its efforts during I9089 to maintain the union in the various shops and to pre II9THE ECONOMIC POSITION OF WOMEN vent the discharge of members who were active union workers it lost heavily The effort resolved itself in I909 into the estab lishment of the right to organize The strike in the Triangle Waist Company turned on this issue The story of the events leading up to the Triangle strike as told by a leading member of the firm practically agrees with the story told by the strikers The company had undertaken to organize its employes into a club with benefits attached The good faith of the company as well as the workingout of the benefit was questioned by the workers The scheme failed and the workers joined the waistmakers union One day without warning a few weeks later one hundred and fifty of the em ployes were dropped the explanation being given by the em ployers that there was no work The following day the com pany advertised for workers In telling the story later they said that they had received an unexpected order but admitted their refusal to reemploy the workers discharged the day pre vious The union then declared a strike or acknowledged a lockout and picketing began The strike or lockout occurred out of the busy season with a large supply at hand of workers unorganized and unemployed Practical trade unionists believed that the manufacturers felt cer tain of success on account of their ability to draw to an unlim ited extent from an unorganized labor market and to employ a guard sufficiently strong to prevent the strikers from reaching the workers with their appeals to join them But the ninety girls and sixty men strikers were not practical they were Russian Jews who saw in the lockout an attempt at oppression In their resist ance which was instinctive they did not count their chances of winning they felt that they had been wronged and they re belled This quick resentment is characteristic of the Russian Jewish factory worker The men strikers were intimidated and lost heart but the women carried on the picketing suffering arrest and abuse from the police and the guards employed by the manufacturers At the end of the third week they appealed to the womens trade union league to protect them if they could against false arrest The league is organized to promote trade unions among 120A WOMANS STRIKE women and its membership is composed of people of leisure as well as of workers A brief inspection by the league of the action of the pickets the police the strike breakers and the workers in the factory showed that the pickets had been intimi dated that the attitude of the police was aggressive and that the guards employed by the firm were insolent The league acted as complainant at police headquarters and crossexamined the arrested strikers it served as witness for the strikers in the magistrates court and became convinced of official prejudice in the police department against the strikers and a strong par tisan attitude in favor of the manufacturers The activity and interest of women some of whom were plainly women of leisure was curiously disconcerting to the manufacturers and every effort was used to divert them At last a young woman promi nent in public affairs in New York and a member of the league was arrested while acting as volunteer picket Here at last was copy for the press During the five weeks of the strike previous to the publicity the forty thousand waist makers employed in the several hun dred shops in New York were with a few exceptions here and there unconscious of the struggle of their fellow workers in the Triangle There was no means of communication among them as the labor press reached comparatively few In the weeks before the general strike was called the forty thousand shirtwaist makers were forty thousand separate individuals So far were they from being conscious of their similarity that they might have been as many individual workers employed in ways as widely separated as people of different trades or as members of different social groups The arrests of sympathizers aroused sufficient public interest for the press to continue the story for ten days including in the reports the treatment of the strikers This furnished the union its opportunity It knew the temper of the workers and pushed the story still further through shop propaganda After three weeks of newspaper publicity and shop propaganda the reports came back to the union that the workers were aroused It was alarming tothe friends of the union to see the confidence of the union officers before issuing the call to strike Trade unionists I21THE ECONOMIC POSITION OF WOMEN reminded the officers that the history of general strikes in un organized trades was the history of failure They invariably answered with a smile of assurance  Wait and see The call was issued Monday night November 22nd at a great mass meeting in Cooper Union addressed by the president of the American Federation of Labor I did not go to bed Monday night said the secretary of the union  our Execu tive Board was in session from midnight until six a m I left the meeting and went out to Broadway near Bleecker street I shall never again see such a sight Out of every shirtwaist factory in answer to the call the workers poured and the halls which had been engaged for them were quickly filled In some of these halls the girls were buoyant confident in others there were girls who were frightened at what they had done When the latter were asked why they had come out in sym pathy they said  How could you help it when a girl in your shop gets up and says Come girls come all the shirtwaist makers are going out  As nearly as can be estimated thirty thousand workers an swered the call or seventyfive per cent of the trade Of these six thousand were Russian men two thousand Italian women possibly one thousand American women and about twenty or twentyone thousand Russian Jewish girls The Italians throughout the strike were a constantly appearing and disap pearing factor but the part played by the American girls was clearly defined The American girls who struck came out in sympathy for the foreigners who struck for a principle but the former were not in sympathy with the principle they did not want a union they imagined that the conditions in the factories where the Russian and Italian girls worked were worse than their own They are in the habit of thinking that the employers treat for eign girls with less consideration and they are sorry for them In striking they were selfconscious philanthropists They were honestly disinterested and as genuinely sympathetic as were the women of leisure who later took an active part in helping the strike They acknowledged no interests in common with the others but if necessary they were prepared to sacrifice a week 122A WOMANS STRIKE or two of work Unfortunately the sacrifice required of them was greater than they had counted on The  foreigners re garded them as just fellow workers and insisted on their join ing the union in spite of their constant protestation We have no grievance we only struck in sympathy But the Russians failed to be grateful took for granted a common cause and demanded that all shirtwaist makers regardless of race or creed continue the strike until they were recognized by the em ployers as a part of the union This difference in attitude and understanding was a heavy strain on the generosity of the American girls It is believed however that the latter would have been equal to what their fellow workers expected if their meetings had been left to the guidance of American men and women who understood their prejudices But the Russian men trusted no one entirely to impart the enthusiasm necessary for the cause It was the daily almost hourly tutelage which the Russian men insisted on the American girls accepting rather than the prolongation of the strike beyond the time they had expected that sent the American girls back as  scabs There were several signs that the two or three weeks experience as strikers was having its effect on them and that with proper care this difficult group of workers might have been organized For instance  scab  had become an opprobrious term to them during their short strike period and on returning to work they accepted the epithet from their fellow workers with great reluctance and even protestation Their sense of superiority also had received a severe shock they could never again be quite so confident that they did not in the nature of things be long to the labor group If the shirtwaist trade in New York had been dominated by any other nationality than the Russian it is possible that other methods of organizing the trade would have been adopted rather than the general strike The Russian workers who fill New York factories are ever ready to rebel against suggestion of oppression and are of all people the most responsive to an idea to which is attached an ideal The union officers understood this and it was because they understood the Russian element in the trade that they answered  Wait and see when their friends 123THE ECONOMIC POSITION OF WOMEN urged caution before calling a general strike in an unorganized trade They knew their people and others did not The feature of the strike which was as noteworthy as the re sponse of thirty thousand unorganized workers was the un yielding and uncompromising temper of the strikers This was due not to the influence of nationality but to the dominant sex The same temper displayed in the shirtwaist strike is found in other strikes of women until we have now a tradeunion truism that  women make the best strikers Womens economic posi tion furnishes two reasons for their being the best strikers one is their less permanent attitude toward their trade and the other their lighter financial burdens While these economic factors help to make women good strikers the genius for sacri fice and the ability to sustain over prolonged periods response to emotional appeals are also important causes Working women have been less ready than men to make the initial sacrifice that tradeunion membership calls for but when they reach the point of striking they give themselves as fully and as instinctively to the cause as they give themselves in their per sonal relationships It is important therefore in following the action of the shirtwaist makers to remember that eighty per cent were women and women without tradeunion experience When the shirtwaist strikers were gathered in separate groups according to their factories in almost every available hall on the East Side the great majority of them received their first instruction in the principles of unionism and learned the necessity of organization in their own trade The quick re sponse of women to the new doctrine gave to the meetings a spirit of revival Like new converts they accepted the new doctrine in its entirety and insisted to the last on the  closed shop But it was not only the enthusiasm of new converts which made them refuse to accept anything short of the closed shop In embracing the idea of solidarity they realized their own weakness as individual bargainers  How long the one week or twoweeksold union girls said do you think we could keep what the employer says he will give us without the union Just as soon as the busy season is over it would be the same as before 124A WOMANS STRIKE Instructions were given to each separate group of strikers to make out a wage scale if they thought they should be paid an increase or to make out other specific demands before con ferring with their employers on terms of settlement The uniform contract drawn up by the union beside requiring a union shop required also the abolition of the subcontract system payment of wages once a week a fiftytwohour week limitation of overtime in any one day to two hours and to not later than 9 p m also payment for all material and implements by employers Important as were the specific demands they were lightly regarded in comparison with the issue of a union shop Nothing can illustrate this better than the strikers treatment of the arbitration proposal which was the outcome of a confer ence between their representatives and the employers In December word came to the union secretary that the manu facturers would probably consider arbitration if the union was ready to submit its differences to a board The officers made reply in the affirmative and communicated their action at once to the strikers Many of the strikers had no idea what arbitra tion meant but as it became clear to them they asked some of them menacingly  Do you mean to arbitrate the recogni tion of the union  It took courage to answer these inexperi enced unionists and uncompromising girls that arbitration would include the question of the union as well as other mat ters The proposition was met with a storm of opposition When the strikers at last discovered that all their representatives counseled arbitration with great reluctance they gave way but at no time was the body of strikers in favor of it A few days later when the arbitrators who represented them reported that the manufacturers on their side refused to arbitrate the question of the union they resumed their strike with an apparent feeling of security and relief Again later they showed the same un compromising attitude when their representatives in the confer ence reported back that the manufacturers would concede im portant points in regard to wage and factory conditions but would not recognize the union The recommendations of the conference were rejected without reservation by the whole body 125THE ECONOMIC POSITION OF WOMEN The strikers at this time lost some of their sympathizers An uncompromising attitude is good tradeunion tactics up to a certain point but the shirtwaist makers were violating all tra ditions Their refusal to accept anything short of the closed shop indicated to many a state of mind which was as irrespon sible as it was reckless Their position may have been reckless but it was not irresponsible Their sometime sympathizers did not realize the endurance of the women or the force of their enthusiasm but insisted on the twenty to thirty thousand raw recruits becoming sophisticated unionists in thirteen short weeks It was after the new year that the endurance of the girls was put to the test During the thirteen weeks benefits were paid out averaging less than 2 for each striker Many of them refused to accept benefits so that the married men could be paid more The complaints of hardships came almost without exception from the men Occasionally it was discovered that a girl was having one meal a day and even at times none at all In spite of being underfed and often thinly clad the girls took upon themselves the duty of picketing believing that the men would be more severely handled Picketing is a physical and nervous strain under the best conditions but it is the spirit of martyrdom that sends young girls of their own volition often insufficiently clad and fed to patrol the streets in mid winter with the temperature low and with snow on the ground some days freezing and some days melting After two or three hours of such exposure often ill from cold they returned to headquarters which were held for the majority in rooms dark and unheated to await further orders It takes uncommon courage to endure such physical expos ure but these striking girls underwent as well the nervous strain of imminent arrest the harsh treatment of the police insults threats and even actual assaults from the rough men who stood around the factory doors During the thirteen weeks over six hundred girls were arrested thirteen were sentenced to five days in the workhouse and several were detained a week or ten days in the Tombs The pickets with strangely few exceptions during the first 126A WOMANS STRIKE few weeks showed remarkable selfcontrol They had been cautioned from the first hour of the strike to insist on their legal rights as pickets but to give no excuse for arrest Like all other instructions they accepted this literally They desired to be good soldiers and every nerve was strained to obey orders But for many the provocations were too great and retaliation began after the fifth week It occurred around the factories where the strikers were losing where peace methods were failing and where the passivity of the pickets was taunted as cowardice But curiously enough during this time the arrests in proportion to the number still on strike were fewer than dur ing the earlier period and the sentences in the courts were lighter The change in the treatment of pickets came with the change in the city administration Apparently peaceful picket ing during the first two months of the strike had been treated as an unlawful act The difficulty throughout the strike of inducing the strikers to accept compromise measures increased as the weeks wore on However seventeen contracts were signed in these latter weeks which did not give the union a voice in determining conditions of work of all workers in the factory During the ten weeks previous contracts were signed which covered all the workers in three hundred and twelve factories Before the strike every shop was open and in most of them there was not a union worker In thirteen short weeks three hundred and twelve shops had been converted into  closed or full union contract shops But the significance of the strike is not in the actual gain to the shirtwaist makers of three hundred union shops for there was great weakness in the ranks of the opposition Trade union gains moreover are measured by what an organization can hold rather than by what it can immediately gain The shirtwaist makers strike was characteristic of all strikes in which women play an active part It was marked by complete selfsurrender to a cause emotional endurance fearlessness and entire willingness to face danger and suffering The strike at times seemed to be an expression of the womans movement rather than the labor movement This phase was emphasized I27THE ECONOMIC POSITION OF WOMEN by the wide expression of sympathy which it drew from women outside the ranks of labor It was fortunate for strike purposes but otherwise unfortunate that the press in publishing accounts of the strike treated the active public expression of interest of a large body of women sympathizers with sensational snobbery It was a matter of wide public comment that women of wealth should contribute sums of money to the strike that they should admit factory girls to exclusive club rooms and should hold mass meetings in their behalf If as was charged any of the women who entered the strike did so from sensational or personal motives they were disarmed when they came into contact with the strikers Their earnestness of purpose their complete abandon to their cause their simple acceptance of outside interest and sympathy as though their cause were the cause of all was a bid for kinship that broke down all barriers Women who came to act as witnesses of the arrests around the factories ended by picketing side by side with the strikers These volunteer pick ets accepted moreover whatever rough treatment was offered and when arrested asked for no favors that were not given the strikers themselves The strike brought about adjustments in values as well as in relationships Before the strike was over federations of profes sional women and women of leisure were endorsing organization for working women and individually these women were acknowl edging the truth of such observations as that made by one of the strikers on her return from a visit to a private school where she had been invited to tell about the strike Her story of the strike led to questions in regard to trade unions On her re turn her comment was  Oh they are lovely girls they are so kindbut I didnt believe any girls could be so ignorant The strike was an awakening for working women in many in dustries and it did more to give the women of the professions and the women of leisure a new point of view and a realization of the necessity for organization among working women than any other single event in the history of the labor movement in this country 128

j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1009471,Sociological Notes,i242525,SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES Private Initiative in Furnishing Public Bath FacilitiesMr Macdonald the wellknown London Fabian would have us believe that every matter for the public good should be undertaken by the municipal government and not by private enterprise He holds that by just so much as private effort is used to promote the kind of work which he considers should be the function of the municipality by just that much is the tone of the city government lowered For every matter which is removed from the hands of the body politic means that its importance is lessened and that a lower class of citizens will be engaged in the direction of public affairs While this is doubtless true to a certain extent it would yet seem that many lessons may be taught the city fathers by private effort Taking public baths as an illustration we have seen in Boston what an enlightened city government can do in the matter of public baths In Philadelphia the municipality has been doing good work of a certain sort but has not covered the whole field The example which I shall discuss shows what may be accomplished by those who are dissatisfied with the existing conditions and who believe that a practical objectlesson will do more than an attempt by mere argument to force the city councils to accept their ideas In years gone by Philadelphia made provision through private enterprise for giving the welltodo opportunities for bathing but the poor were not thought of I have a certificate of Hlaskos Institute for Physical Education issued nearly forty years ago which states that Mr has paid the sum of fifteen dollars which entitles him to the use of the swimming bath for the first two seasons or to instructions in gymnastics for six months or to four months instruc tion in dancing or to two tickets for the junior soirees next season This shows that in those days skill in the swimming pool was linked with other accomplishments of gentle breeding and that the bath house was a luxury of the rich But it is the masses who are most concerned in the bathing problem How great that problem is will become evident when we consider that while Philadelphia is known as a city of homes and while many of these homes have bathing facilities as many indeed as any other city in this  Contributed by Mr

can boast yet in the older and more closely populated parts where the people live on crowded streets in single rooms and in tene ments certainly not one family in twenty has access to a bath To meet this need very little has been done The most important effort is that of the city authorities It was not until 1885 however that the first municipal bath house was established on the Delaware river front Today the floating river baths have disappeared and in their place we find eight bath houses which have been erected from time to time in different parts of the city These baths are simply pools averaging il size about 40 by 60 feet They are open only during the summeron five days for men and two for women As a rule they are not located in the most densely populated portion of our city and as most of their patrons are the younger men and women who simply desire to get amusement from swimming they do not reach a very large classperhaps the class most in need of them They are however doing an enormous amount of good It is said that more than three million baths were taken in them last summer but they touch only one corner of the bathing problem Again several charitable organizations have made attempts in the past to meet this need but they have been only partly successful Their efforts more often consisted simply in having one or two tubs a few shower baths or a small pool in connection with their other work and in some cases the sanitary conditions have been so bad that the establishments could not be considered unmixed blessings in the poorer districts one also finds private bathing establishments where tubs Rnssian Turkish and shower baths may be obtained but they are usually in small and poorly kept quarters tlle charges are highso high that the bath is made a luxuryand the poorest class is absolutely cut off from patronizing them During the past year or two some of the summer playgrounds have had shower baths in connection with them and the cooling effect of these baths has added wonderfully to their popularity with the children These efforts in various directions have simply been making the field ripe for a concentrated and welldirected attempt to meet the existing need and the organization of an association for the purpose of supplying the want of bathing facilities in the older and more densely crowded portion of Philadelphia is the culmination of these various efforts The organization of the Public Baths Association of Philadelphia in I895 was the result of the earnest conviction of a young woman that something must be done to relieve the need of which she had had such practical knowledge in her work among her less fortunate fellows 281 I39140 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY As the outcome of her untiring effort the collection of money was commenced and a site was secured on one of the worst streets in the socalled slum district of our city After baths in other cities had been visited and the construction of bath houses at home and abroad had been carefully studied plans were prepared for a building which should be a model in every respect That buildinc has now been finished and for ten months has been open to the public It stands on the corner of two narrow streets in the middle of one of our city blocks and can be approached from three main thoroughfares On the first floor is the mens department where are twentysix showers and one tub which are reached after passing through a com fortable waiting room There is a separate entrance and hallway from which stairs go down to the public wash house in the basement and up to the womens waiting room and baths on the second floor Here are fourteen showers and three tubs The superintendents quarters are also on this floor and above them in a loft are the tanks which supply the building with water and which have a capacity of 6000 gallons For five centsthe cost of a glass of beerthe bather secures the use of a dressing room and shower bath with hot and cold water a clean towel and a fresh cake of soap and from the expressions of opinion continually heard the patrons evidently feel that the nickel they pay is well spent and that they have received something more than its usual value In the basement is a public wash house where for five cents an hour women may bring their washing using the stationary tubs and drying closets the ironing boards and irons In this room is the laundry machinery used to wash the bath house towels The remainder of the basement is occupied by the lighting heating and ventilating plant The ground building and equipment have cost 30000 The running expenses of the establishment will amount to 3600 a year The fees from bathers during its first year should equal more than half this sum and from the present outlook the business should eventually become almost if not quite selfsupporting The building was opened to the public in April last and at once became popular Its patrons are of every sort froni the welltodo shopkeeper to the shoeless tramp White and colored Jew and Gen tile meet here on equal terms and are one and all treated with civility and kindness They pay for what they get and so are regarded in the light of patrons and in no way as the recipients of charity The baths have steadily if slowly grown in popularity While the building has a capacity of more than nine hundred baths a day and the largest number on any one day so far has been but 541 yet the 282SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES end of the first six months saw the 20000 mark reached and passed This result has been accomplished by wide advertising by kind and considerate treatment of every patron and by showing how much comfort can be secured at the cost of a nickel Many thousand cards have been distributed from house to house on the streets and in stores while the cooperation of numerous barbers grocers saloonkeepers and charitable organizations has resulted in many more being put in the way of possible bathers At first the tubs especially in the womens department were much preferred to the shower baths and as their number was limited and our advertisements stated that they were reserved for the use of the older women only it soon became a most difficult problem to know where to draw the age line as all the women young and old claimed that they were elderly and so should be allowed to use the tubs It was not until our superintendent suggested that the price of the tubs should be made ten cents instead of five that a satisfactory solution was reached This has proved the strongest and most convincing argument possible and today while we have a good tub trade the shower baths are rapidly increasing in popularity and when a woman has once tried them she almost invariably says that she will never use the tub again It is surprising at times to find in what large numbers our Hebrew citizens patronize the baths and to see how strict many of them are in observing the provisions of the Mosaic law in this respect On September 14 only eighteen persons bathed but two days later the eve of the Hebrew New Year more than four hundred Israelites pre sented themselves to take their New Years bath though the day was raw and cold and many of them clearly did not come from a mere sense of pleasure Friday and Saturday are the busiest days On the former the Hebrew is most in evidence while on the latter the Gentile is greatly in the majority The wash house has been an entirely new departure for this country although one quite common on the other side of the water It is however slowly increasing in popularity and more than six hun dred persons have used it during the past ten months Its pa trons vary from the men who come on Sundays to wash their only set of underclothing to the small shopkeepers who send their servants to do the family washing and ironing From the start careful records have been kept of the doings in every department and many interesting and some curious facts showing the relation which the weather the temperature the day of the week and other factors bear to the patronage of the baths are 283 I4i142 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY found in the superintendents record book The business of the asso ciation is also conducted on modern lines Its books were opened by an expert accountant and are so complete that every detail of the business can be followed with ease and accuracy Music and Public EducationPeoples Singing Classes in Bos ton The movement to establish Peoples Singing Classes in Boston grew from a desire to provide an opportunity for all who wished to learn to read music at sight and to practice chorus singing The remarkable success of a similar scheme in New York under the lead ership of Mr Frank Damrosch made it reasonable to suppose that if a concerted effort were made by the people of Boston the success would be equally great This hope was justified by the fact that owing to the enthusiasm of the people and their desire to learn to sing four halls were opened during the first season 1898 in different parts of the city and the successful work of the members was demon strated by a concert given in Music Hall The support for this movement comes from the people themselves All the teachers give their services The only expenses are for the use of the halls for music printing and stationery To cover these expenses each person pays a fee of ten cents for each lesson The classes are thus entirely selfsupporting and this fact in itself insures the success which comes to every undertaking that is of the people by the people and for the people The age requirement is eighteen years or over for men sixteen years or over for women This is the only requirement The value to be derived from such study of music as the work in these classes affords is great The privilege of participating in the rendering of the most beautiful music in the world is made open to all No previous knowledge of music and no especially good voice is necessary Whoever is willing to try can learn to take part in chorus singing One may not be able to sing alone but the enthusiasm of finding ones self in the midst of a large chorus is such that one cannot help singing with the rest To take part in the work of these singing classes supplies inspiration not only for the short hour on Sunday afternoon but also for the toil of all the days of the week All inquiries should be addressed to the Executive Committee of the Peoples Singing Classes Box 2880 Boston Post Office A remarkable growth of interest in the movement is evinced by the greatly increased attendance at the Peoples Singing Classes The appreciation shown has astonished Mr and Mrs H L Higginson Miss Dexter Mr Pickering and Mr Edmund Billings who have had Contributed by Mr Charles W Birtwell Boston 284SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES the matter in hand Even Walter Damrosch the father of the idea has expressed surprise at the hearty interest manifested in Boston at the opening of only the second season The three classes of last year had a membership of about three hundred and fifty Five classes have been organized this year whose average total attendance is over eight hundred and fifty The rudiments of music are taught the beginners in the classes at the North End Industrial School North Bennet street the Peoples Institute II7I Tremont street and in Dahlgren Memorial Hall in South Boston Mr Gibb Miss Hoar and Miss Malloy teach these classes which meet at three oclock every Sunday afternoon The class which is recruited from the three elementary classes meets in Union Hall 48 Boylston street at the same hour every week It has two hundred members S W Coles advanced class which meets in Bumstead Hall has already five hundred members It is practicing at present on Rossinis Stabat Mater No new members will be received into this class but members of the next lower class will be promoted to it Increase of CrimeIn a recent publication of the Massachusetts Prison Association a strong plea is made for the proposed legislation looking forward to complete state control of penal institutions that is of the placing of the county prisons as well as a number of reform atory institutions under the control of a state board One of the main reasons urged for this change is that it will secure a classification of all the prisoners of the state An interesting statement is made concern ing the magnitude of crime in the State of Massachusetts and some of the probable results to be expected from a proper classification of the various inmates of county prisons On these two points we quote the following statements  Magnitude of Massachusetts Crime Questions How serious a matter the growth and size of the crime question is is shown by the official figures In 1883 the number of arrests in Massachusetts was 63803 thenumber of commitments was 24I25 and the average prison population for the year was 3893 In 1898 the corresponding figures are 99336 arrests 29796 commitments and the average prison population for the year 7654 The cost of police courts and prisons in I89S was over 2ooo00ooo These figures are startling and demand the most careful inquiry as to how this increasing volume of crime may be stopped It can be done in two ways first by preventive measures such treatment of the causes of crime as shall reduce the number of persons who commit offences the first time and second through a classified prison system by so training those who have committed one 285 I43144 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY offence that they will abandon their criminal courses and become law abiding citizens The large opportunity for the application of this second means of reducing crime in this Commonwealth is shown by the fact that substantially onehalf of all the persons committed to the county prisons have served previous sentences in the same institu tions The recognition of this opportunity in recent years has led to a change in the methods of dealing with criminals especially with beginners in crime so that emphasis is now put upon their reforma tion with view to preventing the commission of a second offence A successful application of these methods will greatly reduce the volume and the cost of crime  Reasons for Classifying Prisonersi As to Length of Sen tences In 1898 there were I6252 commitments for nonpayment of fines and costs 8203 on sentences of less than six months 1929 on sentences from six to twelve months 516 for from one to two years 135 for fronm two to three years and 79 for more than three years It may fairly be supposed that the length of a prisoners sentence indi cates the heinousness of his offence It is the estimate placed by the court upon his act His offence may or may not indicate his real char acter he may be better or worse than his deed But when thousands of cases are considered it will be found that those who have long sen tences are worse than those who have short ones A system which puts together those who have a sentence of a few weeks and those who are committed for several years must work injury to the former  The large number of commitments for the nonpayment of fines and costs makes the existing system especially objectionable More than I6ooo were committed for this cause in 1898 Their offences were triflingso trifling that the courts did not think a direct sentence to imprisonment was warranted But inability to pay the fine resulted in imprisonment Some of them remained but a few days Nearly 5000 of them paid their fines and were released within a short time after their commitment If any one of the I6ooo had had a very few dollars of ready cash he would have escaped imprisonment altogether but lacking this they were all sent to county prisons which contained every grade of criminals  2 As to Offences 1718 were committed for offences against the person such as manslaughter robbery assault etc There were 2675 commitments for offences againt property including burglary arson embezzlement larceny receiving stolen goods fraud malicious mis chief etc These 4393 commitments for offences against the person and against property constituted about 16 per cent of all the commit ments The remaining 84 per cent were for offences against public 286SOCIOLOGICAL NOTrS 145 order and decency drunkenness the principal offence disturbing the peace being idle and disorderly neglect of family vagrancy etc 3 As to Criminal Character First offences do not proveestablished criminal purposes A subsequent offence tends to do so and failure to refrain from crime after repeated punishments is properly accepted as proof of a deliberate purpose to do evil or of a weakness of character which makes it impossible to resist temptation In either case the habitual offender is a dangerous companion within or without the prison for the person who is not established in criminal habits or pur poses More than onehalf of all who are committed to county pris ons have been in the same institutions before and those committed for the first time are compelled to associate with many habitual offend ers of a distinctly criminal type 4 As to Ages In 1898 there were 1212 commitments to the county prisons of persons less than 21 years of age more than 9000 of persons between 21 and 30 nearly 9000 between 31 and 40 more than 5000 between 4r and 50 and nearly 2800 above 50 More than 2500 about onefourth of those below 31 years of age were com mitted for offences against the person and against property The remaining threefourths within those ages were for offences against public order and decency English Law for Reform of DrunkardsA new English law passed at the last session of parliament authorizing an extension of certain radical measures for the treatment of habitual drunk ards went into effect on the first of January I899 In I888 an act was passed by the English parliament which authorized the Secretary of State for the Home Department to grant licenses to physicians of repu tation to establish retreats for inebriates and power was given local magistrates to commit to these retreats for a period of one year such persons who declared their willingness to submit to treatment This act has worked well The retreats have been carefully inspected by the home office but ten years experience shows that the term of one year is too short to effect a complete change or reformation and also that although these retreats have increased in number private enterprise is not wholly adequate to cope with the problem Under the act of I888 leaving the establishment of such retreats to private enterprise practically only persons of means could secure the advan tages of treatment The new act therefore authorized county and borough councils to establish and maintain retreats to which persons whose circumstances do not permit their being maintained in a private retreat may be sent and power is given to judges to commit convicted persons to retreats instead of to penal servitude and additional powers 287ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY are given to the local police magistrates Persons may be detained for a period of three years and in cases of persons of means being so committed the cost of maintaining the inmate can be recovered Local magistrates may commit for periods not exceeding three years in cases where habitual drunkards have come before them more than three times in a single year In connection with this action of the British parliament it is interest ing also to note a paragraph on the same subject in Mayor Quincys last annual address to the city council of Boston where a commission of inquiry has been established to report on this question The follow ing paragraph contains some interesting facts that would doubtless hold good for other cities than Boston  It seems to me that the problem of so adjusting the penalties for drunkenness that on the one hand this form of misdemeanor will receive sufficient punishment to restrict as far as practicable over indulgence in intoxicating liquor without on the other hand impos ing too large a direct financial burden upon the communitythrough the cost of maintaining an unnecessary number of drunkards in con finement at the public expense and inflicting a still larger loss upon those dependent upon them for supportis worthy of closer study and more practical investigation than it has received From a social standpoint this is one of the most serious questions with which the city has to deal on account of the very large number of persons who are directly or indirectly affected It has appeared to me that the number of persons confined in our huses of correction for drunken ness was excessive and that some way should be found to reduce the expense and loss to the community without increasing the amount of intemperance During the year ending January 31 1895 there were 847 committals to the house of correction at Deer Island on account of drunkenness amounting to about 75 per cent of the total committals and on the basis of a pro rata division of the expenses of the institution the direct cost to the county for the confinement of drunkards for that year amounted to over rIiooo at this one institution In addition it is estimated that about 3000 persons are committed to our county jail yearly for this offence besides a consid erable number sent to the house of correction at South Boston In the last three years the committals to Deer Island for drunkenness have increased about 30 per cent Past experience has shown the intimate relation between changes in the laws affecting the punish ment for this offence and the drunkard population of Deer Island and I believe it to be highly desirable that this important question should be carefully inquired into from the standpoint of the financial social and moral interests of this great municipal community with a 288 146SOCIOLOGICAL NOTES 147 view to the recommendation of remedial measures it such are found practicable With this object in view I have recently appointed a commission of inquiry consisting of seven men and women specially qualified to investigate this question carefully and without prejudice I trust that the report which they will make within the next few months will throw some light upon this important problem and will lead to amendments to the present laws if these are found desirable

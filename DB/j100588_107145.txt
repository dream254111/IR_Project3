OBSERVATIONS ON LAC BY CHARLES HATCHETT ESQ F R S READ APRIL 12 1804 TH N PERIOD IS UNCERTAIN WHEN THE SUBSTANCE CALLED LAC SO CURIOUS IN ITS ORIGIN AND SO USEFUL TOMANY ARTS WAS FIRST INTRO DUCED INTO EUROPE AND ALTHOUGH IT PROBABLY WAS KNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS YET THE INACCURACY OF THEIR DESCRIPTIONS PRECLUDES THIS FROM BEING STATED AS A POSITIVE FACT THE NATIVES OF INDIA HAVE LONG EMPLOYED IT FOR VARIOUS PUR POSES EXCLUSIVE OF THOSE WHICH CAUSE IT TO BE IN REQUEST WITH EUROPEANS BUT MANY OF THE INDIAN PROCESSES ARE UNDOUBTEDLY AS YET UNKNOWN TO US ONE OF THESE OF A VERY USEFUL NATURE WAS SOME TIME SINCE OBLIGINGLY COMMUNICATED TO ME BY CHARLES WILKINS  ESQ F R S AND HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF THIS INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF LAC MR WILKINS INFORMED ME THAT THE HINDUS DISSOLVE SHELL LAC IN WATER BY THE MERE ADDITION OF A LITTLE BORAX AND THE SOLUTION MDCCCIV C CI92 MR HATCHETT5 ANALYTICAL EXPERIMENTS BEING THEN MIXED WITH IVORYBLACK OR LAMPBLACK IS EMPLOYED BY THEM AS AN INK WHICH WHEN DRY IS NOT EASILY ACTED UPON BY DAMNP OR WATER UPON TRIAL I FOUND THE FACT TO BE EXACTLY AS MR WILKINS HAD STATED AND THEREFORE MADE OTHER EXPERIMENTS BUT THE RESULTS OF THESE I SHALL AT PRESENT OMIT AS THEY WILL OCCUR WITH MORE PROPRIETY AND PERSPICUITY IN THE LATTER PART OF THIS PAPER IN RESPECT TO THE NATURAL HISTORY OF LAC WE ARE MUCH IN DEBTED TO MR KERR MR SAUNDERS AND DR ROXBURGH FROM WHOSE VALUABLE COMMUNICATIONS TO THIS SOCIETY WE LEARN MANY CURIOUS PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE FORMATION OF THIS SUB STANCE WHICH FROM THEIR ACCOUNTS AND FROM INSPECTION EVI DENTLY APPEARS TO BE THE NIDUS OR COMB OF THE INSECT CALLED COCCUS OR CHERMES LACCA DEPOSITED ON BRANCHES OF CERTAIN SPECIES OF MIMOSA AND OTHER PLANTS LAC IS DISTINGUISHED INTO FOUR KINDS OF WHICH HOWEVER ONLY THREE ARE COMMONLY KNOWN IN COMMERCE VIZ STICK LAC SEED LAC AND SHELL LAC THE DIFFERENCE OF THESE WITH THAT OF THE FOURTH CALLED LUMP LAC IS AS FOLLOWS I STICK LAC IS THE SUBSTANCE OR COMB IN ITS NATURAL STATE INCRUSTING SMALL BRANCHES OR TWIGS  SEED LAC IS SAID TO BE ONLY THE ABOVE WHICH HAS BEEN SE PARATED FROM THE TWIGS AND REDUCED INTO SMALL FRAGMENTS BUT I SUSPECT IT TO HAVE UNDERGONE

CONSIDERABLY DEPRIVED OF THE COLOURING MATTER S LUMP LAC IS FORMED FROM SEED LAC LIQUEFIED BY FIRE AND FORMED INTO CAKES AND 4 SHELL LAC ACCORDING TO MR KERR AND MR SAUNDERS IS PREPARED FROM THE CELLS LIQUEFIED STRAINED AND FORMED INTO THIN TRANSPARENT LAMINAE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER C SEPARATE THE CELLS FROMH THE BRANCHES BREAK THEM INTO SMALL C PIECES THROW THEM INTO A TUB OF WATER FOR ONE DAY WASH  OFFTHE RED WATER DRY THE CELLS AND WITH THEM FILL A CYLINDRI C CAL TUBE OF COTTON CLOTH TWO FEET LONG AND ONE OR TWO INCHES C IN DIAMETER TIE BOTH ENDS AND TURN THE BAG ABOVE A CHARCOAL FIRE AS THE LAC LIQUEFIES TWIST THE BAG AND WHEN A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY HAS TRANSUDED THE PORES OF THE CLOTH LAY IT UPON A SMOOTH JUNK OF THE PLANTAIN TREE AND WITH A STRIP OF THE PLAN C TAIN LEAF DRAW IT INTO A THIN LAMELLA TAKE IT OFF WHILE FLEXIBLE CC FOR IN A MINUTE IT WVILL BE HARD AND BRITTLE THE DEGREE OF PRESSURE ON THE PLANTAIN TREE REGULATES AC CORDING TO MR SAUNDERS THE THICKNESS OF THE SHELL AND THE QUALITY OF THE BAG DETERMINES ITS FINENESS AND TRANSPARENCY ASSAM FURNISHES THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF THE WHOLE OF THE LAC NOW IN USE MR KERR SPEAKING OF STICK LAC OBSERVES THAT THE BEST LAC IS OF A DEEP RED COLOUR FOR IF IT IS PALE AND PIERCED AT THE TOP  MR WI L K INS INFORMS ME THAT THE CRUDE LAC AS IT IS TAKEN FROM THE BRANCHES AND TWIGS OF THE TREES IS USUALLY DEPRIVED OF ITS COLOURING MATTER BY BOILING HAVING BEEN PREVIOUSLY REDLUCED BY POUNDING INTO SMALL FRAGMENTS IN BENGAL THE SILK DYERS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO THUS PRODUCE WHAT WE CALL THE SEED LAC WHICH THEY DO FOR THE SAKE OF THE COLOUR T PHIL TRANS 1781 P 378 1 PHIL TRANS 1789 P I09 CC 2194 MR HATCHETTS ANALYTICAL EXPERIMENTS THE VALUE IS DIMINISHED BECAUSE THE INSECTS HAVE LEFT THEIR CELLS AND CONSEQUENTLY THESE CAN BE OF NO USE AS A DYE OR COLOUR BUT PROBABLY MAY BE BETTER FOR VARNISHES THE SEED LAC WHICH I HAVE EXAMINED CONTAINED BUT LITTLE OF THE COLOURING MATTER AND APPEARED AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED TO HAVE UNDERGONE SOME PROCESS OF PURIFICATION BUT OF ALL THE VARIETIES SHELL LAC CONTAINS THE LEAST OF THE TINGING SUBSTANCE AS MAY WELL BE EXPECTED WHEN THE MODE OF PREPARING IT IS CONSIDERED IT IS REMARKABLE THAT ALTHOUGH LAC HAS BEEN KNOWN AND IM PORTED INTO EUROPE DURING SO LONG A TIME THAT THE DATE CANNOT NOW BE ASCERTAINED YET IT HAS BUT LITTLE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF CHEMISTS THE FIRST CHEMIST OF EMINENCE WHO MENTIONS IT AND THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS SUBJECTED IT TO ANY THING LIKE A REGULAR EXAMINATION IS THE YOUNGER GEOFFROY WHOSE PAPER IS PUBLISHED IN THE MEM DE IACAD DE PARIS FOR THE YEAR I714 IN THIS PAPER MR GEOMFOY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY INDUCED TO EXAMINE IT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS TINGING SUBSTANCE BUT HE NEVERTHELESS HAS NOT NEGLECTED THE SUBSTANCE WHICH CONSTITUTES THE CELLS THIS HE CONSIDERS TO BE A SORT OF WAX VERY DISTINCT FROM THE NATURE OF GUM OR RESIN BUT IT IS TO HE OBSERVED THAT HE FORMED THIS OPINION NOT SO MUCH UPON THE RESULTS OF CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS AS UPON THE CELLULAR CONSTRUCTION OBSERVED IN THE STICK LAC WHICH AS HE JUSTLY REMARKS DEMONSTRATES IT TO BE FORMED BY INSECTS AFTER THE MANNER THAT THE HONEYCOMB IS FORMED BY BEES AND THAT IT IS NOT

THE NATIVES LITINBITSICI THIS SUBSTANCE HE SAYS IS SCARCELY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM BEESWAX WHICH IT MUCH RESEMBLES IN COLOUR AND ODOUR AND THAT IT IS PRODUCED BY A GRAYISH INSECT MUCH LARGER THAN THE CHERMES LACCA IT IS EVI DENT HOWEVER FROM GEOFFROYS DESCRIPTION THAT THIS SUBSTANCE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE COMMON LAC AND THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT BUT THAT IT IS THE SAME AS THAT WHICH WAS A FEW YEARS AGO EXAMINED BY DR PEARSON UNDER THE NAME OF WHITE LAC A SUBSTANCE RESEMBLING THE PELA OF THE CHINESET GEOFFROY AS I HAVE STATED CONSIDERED LAC AS A SORT OF WAX AND SINCE HIS TIME IT HAS

IT A KIND OF WAX  BUT GREN  AND FOURCROY JJ REGARD IT AS A TRUE RESIN MR KERR OBSERVES THAT AS A RED SUBSTANCE IS OBTAINED BY INCISION FROM THE PLASO TREE VERY ANALOGOUS TO LAC IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE

WATER IS POURED ON STICK LAC WHICH HAS BEEN SEPA RATED FROM THE VEGETABLE BRANCHES AND REDUCED TO A COARSE POWDER IT IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TO BE TINGED WITH RED AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HEAT A DEEP COLOURED CRIMSON SOLUTION IS FORMED REPEATED OPERATIONS OF THIS KIND REDUCE STICK LAC TO A YELLOWISH BROWN SUBSTANCE AND THE WATER NO LONGER RECEIVES ANY COLOUR THE PORTION THUS SEPARATED FROM STICK LAC HAS UPON AN AVERAGE AMOUNTED IN MY EXPERIMENTS TO ABOUT IO PER CENT BUT THIS IS NOT TO BE REGARDED AS THE TOTAL QUANTITY FOR A PART IS OB0 STINATELY RETAINED BY THE RESIN AND OTHER INGREDIENTS SO THAT IT CANNOT BE COMPLETELY SEPARATED AND MOREOVER VERY CONSI DERABLE VARIATIONS MUST BE EXPECTED IN DIFFERENT SAMPLES FINE SEED LAC DID NOT AFFORD MORE THAN 21J OR 3 PER CENT OF THE COLOURING SUBSTANCE AND SHELL LAC WHEN TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER I E MERELY WITH WATER DID NOT YIELD MORE THAN 2J PER CENT S ALCOHOL DISSOLVES A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF EACH OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LAC AND WHEN HEAT IS NOT EMPLOYED THE DIS SOLVED PART IS RESIN COMBINED WITH SOME OF THE COLOURING MATTER BUT IF THE LAC IS DIGESTED WITH HEATED ALCOHOL THEN THE SOLUTION IS MORE OR LESS TURBID IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME OF THE OTHER IN GREDIENTS BECOMING MIXED AND SUSPENDED SO THAT IT IS AFTERWARDS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IT IN A STATE OF PURITY AND TRANS PARENCY EITHER BY REPOSE OR BY FILTRATION THE RESIN MAY BE OBTAINED BY IMMEDIATELY SUBJECTING THEAND OBSERVATIONS ON LAC 97 SOLUTION TO EVAPORATION OR DISTILLATION OR BY PREVIOUSLY POURING IT INTO WATER WITH WHICH A SMALL QUANTITY OF MURIATIC OR ACETIC ACID HAS BEEN MIXED FOR THUS WHEN THE WHOLE IS HEATED A CURDY PRECIPITATE OF RESIN IS FORMED AND MAY BE SEPARATED BY A FILTER AFTER WHICH THE LIQUOR MAY BE EVAPORATED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANY RESIN OR OTHER SUBSTANCE WHICH MAY REMAIN IN SOLU TION AFTER THE FIRST OPERATION   LO 1WTHU THE SOLUTION FORMED BY DIGESTING STICK LAC IN ALCOHOL WITHOUT HEAT IS OF A DARK BROWNISHRED COLOUR AND THE INSOLUBLE PART SUBSIDES IN THE STATE OF A DARK COLOURED MAGMA THIS RETAINS THE GREATER PART OF THE COLOURING MATTER WHICH AS I HAVE AL READY OBSERVED IS MOST EASILY SOLUBLE IN WATER THE PROPORTION OF RESIN THUS DISSOLVED WHEN STICK LAC IS TREATED WITH ALCOHOL HAS IN MY EXPERIMENTS AMOUNTED TO 67 OR 68 PER CENT BUT THIS MUST DEPEND ON THE QUALITY OF THE SAMPLES THE SEED LAC WHICH I EXAMINED WAS VERY PURE AND YIELDED TO ALCOHOL ABOUT 88 PER CENT OF RESIN IT CONTAINED BUT LITTLE OF THE COLOURING MATTER AND THE OTHER SUBSTANCES SUBSIDED AND FORMED A CLOUD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS VESSEL SHELL LAC IN SMALL FRAGMENTS BY SIMPLE DIGESTION WITH ALCOHOL AFFORDED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE NEARLY 81 PER CENT PART OF THE RESIN HOWEVER STILL REMAINED MIXED WITH THE RESIDUUM AND COULD NOT BE SEPARATED BUT BY SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONS THIS PART AMOUNTED TO ABOUT 1O SO THAT THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF RESIN IN THE SHELL LAC WHICH I EMPLOYED MAY BE ESTIMATED AT 91 PER CENT WHEN THE SHELL LAC WAS ONLY REDUCED INTO SNMALL FRAGMENTS THESE AFTER THE SEPARATION OF THE FIRST PORTION OF RESIN RE TAINED THEIR FIGURE BUT WERE BECOME MORE BULKY VERY ELASTIC198 MR HATOHETT ANALYTICAL EXPERIENTS AND NEARLY WHITE I AT FIRST THEREFORE SUSPECTED THAT SOME CAOUTCHOUC WAS PRESENT IN LAC BUT FINDING THAT BOILING WATER DESTROYED THIS ELASTICITY I WAS INDUCED TO MAKE  SUBSEQUENT EXI PERIMENTS BY WHICH I DISCOVERED THAT THE ELASTICITY OF THIS RESIDUUM WAS PRINCIPALLY OWING TO A SUBSTANCE WHICH APPEARED TO POSSESS THE PRPERTIESOF VEGETABLE GLUTEN THIS HOWEVER I SHALL MORE FULLY NOTICE IN ANOTHER PART OF THE PAPER  THE RESIN OBTAINED FROM THE VARIETIES OF LAC IS BROWNISHW YELT LOW AND IS NOT SO BRITTLE AS THE GENERALITY OF OTHER RESINOUS SUBSTANCES G SULPHURIC ETHER DOES NOT SEEM TO ACT SO POWERFULLY UPON THE VARIETIES OF LAC AS ALCOHOL FOR AS A GREAT PART OF THE RESIN IS PROTECTED BY THE COLOURING MATTER AND BY THE OTHER INGREDIENTS WHICH ARE INSOLUBLE IN ETHER IT NATURALLY FOLLOWS THAT LESS OF IT CAN BE SEPARATED BY THIS LIQUID THAN BY ALCOHOL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LAC WHICH HAVE BEEN DIGESTED IN ETHER ARE CONSIDERABLY SOFTENED ALTHOUGH IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY LITTLE AL TERATION IS PRODUCED ETHER THEREFORE IS NOT THE BEST MENSTTUUM FOR LAC BUT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IT MAY BE OCCASIONALLY EMPLOYED WITH ADVANTAGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANALYSIS 4 CONCENTRATED SULPHURIC ACID ACTS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ON THE COLOURING MATTER OF LAC BUT AFTER A SHORT DIGESTION IN A SANDBATH THE WHOLE IS CONVERTED INTO A REDDISHBROXVN THICK LIQUOR WHICH SOON BECOMES BLACK AND THE CHIEF PART OF THE LAC IS SEPARATED IN AN INSOLUBLE STATE RESEMBLING COAL DURING THE SOLUTION OF LAC IN SULPHURIC ACID A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF SULPHUREOUS ACID GAS IS EVOLVED JS WHEN LAC IS DIGESTED WITH NITRIC AACID NITROUS GAS IS AT FIRST PRODUCED THE LAC SWELLS MUCH AND IS CONVERTED INTOAND OBSERVATIONS O LA I9O A DEEP YELLOW OPAQUE BRITTLE SUBSTANCE WHICH BY A SUFFICIENCY OF NITRIC ACID AND CONTINUATION OF THE DIGESTION DURING ABOUT 48 HOURS IS DISSOLVED THE SOLUTION HOWEVER IS TURBID AND WHEN POURED INTO A LARGE QUANTITY OF DISTILLED WATER DEPOSITS SOME YELLOWISH FLOCCULI WHICH BEING COLLECTED ARE FOUND TO BE A SORT OF WAX THE FILTRATED LIQUOR IS OF A BRIGHT GOLDEN YELLOW AND WHEN SATURATED BY AMMONIA CHANGES TO ORANGE COLOUR BUT DOES NOT YIELD ANY PRECIPITATE NOR ANY TRACES OF OXALIC OR MALIC ACID THIS YELLOW NITRIC SOLUTION IS CONVERTED BY EVAPORATION INTO A DEEP YELLOW SUBSTANCE WHICH BURNS LIKE RESIN BUT IS SOLUBLE IN BOILING WATER THE ALKALIS AND LIME BEING ADDED TO THIS AQUEOUS SOLUTION DO NOT PRODUCE ANY PRECIPITATE BUT THE YELLOW COLOUR IS VERY CONSIDERABLY DEEPENED AND BY EVAPORATION AN ORANGECOLOURED SUBSTANCE IS OBTAINED WHICH IS STILL EASILY SOLUBLE IN WATER AND CONSISTS OF THE DEEP YELLOW SUBSTANCE ABOVEMENTIONED COM BINED WITH THE ALKALI OR LIME 6 MURIATIC ACID DISSOLVES THE COLOURING MATTER AND GLUTEN OF LAC BUT ITS ACTION ON THESE IS FEEBLE UNLESS THE RESIN HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY SEPARATED 7 ACETOUS ACID IN ITS EFFECTS MUCH RESEMBLES MURIATIC ACID 8 STICK LAC SEED LAC AND SHELL LAC ARE PARTIALLY DISSOLVED BY ACETIC ACID AND IF THIS BE HEATED A CONSIDERABLE PORTION IS TAKEN UP THE DISSOLVED PART CONSISTS OF THE COLOURING EXTRACT OF RESIN AND OF GLUTEN THE WAX BEING THE ONLY INGREDIENT WHICH IS IN SOLUBLE IN THIS MENSTRUUM BUT A PORTION OF THE FORMER SUBSTANCES MDCCCIV D D0OO MR LJATCHETRS ANALYTICAL EXPERINZENTS BEING ENVELOPED BY THE WAX ARE PROTECTED FROM THE ACTION OF THE ACETIC ACID RRHE ACETIC SOLUTION OF LAC BECOMES TURBID WHEN COLD AND DEPOSITS PART OF THE RESIN  A PORTION HOWEVER REMAINS IN SOLU TION AND MAY BE PRECIPITATED BY WATER AFTER WHICH THE LIQUOR RETAINS SOME GLUTEN AND COLOURING EXTRACT WHICH MAY BE PRE CIPITATED BY SATURATING THE ACID WITH AN ALKALI AND BY SUBSEQUENT BOILING FOR THE REASONS ABOVE STATED IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO EFFECT A COMPLETE SOLUTION OF LAC BY MEANS OF ACETIC ACID BUT THIS MAY NEVERTHELESS BE ADVANTAGEOUSLY EMPLOYED IN ANALYTICAL OPERA TIONS WHEN ALTERNATELY USED WITH ALCOHOL 9 A SATURATED SOLUTION OF BORACIC ACID IN WATER DISSOLVES THE COLOURING EXTRACT BUT AS THE EFFECT DOES NOT SURPASS THAT OF WATER ALONE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT LAC IS LITTLE IF AT ALL ACTED UPON BY BORACIC ACID LO IT HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED THAT SUBBORATE OF SODA OR BORAX HAS A POWERFUL EFFECT ON LAC SO AS TO RENDER IT SOLUBLE IN WATER AND AS THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS PROVE THAT BORACIC ACID ALONE SCARCELY ACTS UPON LAC THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE EXCESS OF SODA PRESENT IN BORAX IS THE ACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND THIS CONCLUSION WILL BE CONFIRMED BY THE RESULTS OF SUBSE QUENT EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH THE ALKALIS IN ORDER TO RENDER LAC ESPECIALLY SHELL LAC SOLUBLE IN WATER ABOUT J OF BORAX IS NECESSARY AND THIS MAY BE PREVIOUSLY DIS SOLVED IN THE WATER OR MAY BE MIXED AND ADDED TOGETHE WITH THE LAC THE BEST PROPORTION OF WATER TO THAT OF LAC IS I8 OR 20 TO I SO THAT 20 GRS OF BORAX AND FOUR OUNCES OF WATER ARE UPONAND OBSERVATIONS ON LAC 20 AN AVERAGE REQUISITE TO DISSOLVE IOO GRS OF SHELL LAC BUT MORE WATER MAY BE OCCASIONALLY ADDED TO SUPPLY THE LOSS CAUSED BY EVAPORATION DURING THE DIGESTION WHICH SHOULD BE MADE NEARLY IN A BOILING HEAT THIS SOLUTION OF SHELL LAC IS TURBID AND OF A REDDISHBROWN COLOUR WHEN CONSIDERABLY DILUTED WITH WATER AND AGITATED A WEAK LATHER IS FORMED IT IS DECOMPOSED BY ACIDS AND THE LAC IS PRECIPITATED IN YELLOW FLOCCULI WHICH DO NOT APPARENTLY DIFFER FROM THE LAC ORIGINALLY EMPLOYED THE GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOLUTION SHOW THAT IT IS A SA PONACEOUS COMPOUND WHICH BEING USED AS A VARNISH OR VEHICLE FOR COLOURS BECOMES WHEN DRY DIFFICULTLY SOLUBLE IN WATER ALTHOUGH THIS WAS THE LIQUID EMPLOYED TO FORM THE SOLUTION A WHITE THICK SCUUM OR CREAM COLLECTS ON THE SURFACE OF THIS LIQUID AFTER IT HAS BEEN SUFFERED TO REMAIN TRANQUIL FOR SOME TIME AND IS FOUND TO BE PRODUCED BY A SORT OF WAX WHICH I SHALL MORE PARTICULARLY NOTICE WHEN THE ANALYSES OF THE VARIETIES OF LAC ARE DESCRIBED BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE THIS WAX APPEARED IN SONIE DEGREE TO BE CONVERTED INTO AN ALMOST INSOLUBLE SOAP BY THE ALKALI OF THE BORAX AND MAY BE REGARDED AS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE TURBIDNESS OF THE SOLUTION II  THE LIXIVIA OF PURE SODA AND OF CARBONATE OF SODA COME PLETELY DISSOLVE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LAC AND THESE SOLUTIONS EXACTLY RESEMBLE THOSE FORMED BY MECANS OF BORAX EXCEPTING THAT THEY ARE DEEPER COLOURED RATHER LESS THAN J OF CARBONATE OF SODA IS REQUIRED TO DISSOLVE SHELL LAC AND THIS SOLUTION WHEN DRIED IS SOONER AFFECTED BY DAMP OR WATER THAN THE SOLUTION PREPARED BY BORAX I2 LIXIVIUM OF PURE OR CAUSTIC POTASH SPEEDILY DISSOLVES TE DD 2M R IHATCHETT S ANALYTICAL EXPERITZENTS VARIETIES OF LAC AND FORMS SAPONACEOUS SOLUTIONS SIMILAR TO THAT IN WHICH BORAX WAS EMPLOYED EXCLUSIVE OF THE COLOUR WHICH IS DEEPER AND MORE APPROACHING TO PURPLE LIXIVIURN OF CARBONATE OF POTASH EXTRACTS A GREAT PART OF THE COLOURING MATTER BUT DOES NOT FORM SO COMPLETE A SOLUTION OF THE ENTIRE SUBSTANCE OF LAC AS WHEN PURE POTASH IS EMPLOYED THE ABOVE ALKALINE SOLUTIONS BY REPOSE AFFORD THE WAXEN SOAP WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED AND ACIDS BEING ADDED TO THESE SO LUTIONS AND TO THAT FORMED BY BORAX PRECIPITATE THE LAC IN A FLOCCULENT STATE AND OF A YELLOW OR BUFF COLOUR WHICH PRECI PITATE WHEN MELTED BECOMES SIMILAR TO THE LAC ORIGINALLY EMN PLOYED IF

FLOCCULENT PRECIPITATE IS OBTAINED WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE ANALOGOUS TO PRECIPITATED VEGETABLE GLUTEN COMBINED WITH SOME OF THE COLOURING EXTRACT 13 PURE AMMONIA AND CARBONATE OF AMMONIA READILY ACT

COMPLETELY SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL ETHER ACETIC ACID NITRIC ACID AND THE LIXIVIA OF POTASH AND SODA WATER PRECIPITATES IT FROMN ALCOHOL ETHER ACETIC ACID AND PARTIALLY FROM NITRIC ACID AND IT POSSESSES THE OTHER GENERAL CHARACTERS OF A TRUE RESIN PROPERTIES OF THE GLUTEN OF LAC IT HAS BEEN ALREADY OBSERVED THAT WHEN SMALL PIECES OF SHELL LAC HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY DIGESTED IN COLD ALCOHOL THEY BECOME WHITE BULKY AND ELASTIC BY DRYING THESE PIECES BECOME BROWNISH AND BRITTLE THE ELASTICITY IS ALSO DESTROYED BY BOILING WATER EXACTLY AS WHEN THE GLUTEN OF WV HEAT IS THUS TREATED IF THE PIECES OF SHELL LAC AFTER THE DIGESTION IN ALCOHOL BE DIGESTED WITH DILUTED MURIATIC ACID OR WITH ACETIC ACID THE GREATER PART OF THE GLUTEN IS DISSOLVED AND MAY BE PRECIPITATED IN A WHITE FLAKY STATE BY ALKALIS BUT IF THESE LAST BE ADDED TO EXCESS AND HEAT BE APPLIED THEN THE GLUTINOUS SUBSTANCE IS RE DISSOLVED AND MAY BE PRECIPITATED BY ACIDS IF THE PIECES OF SHELL LAC AFTER DIGESTION IN ALCOHOL BE TREATED WITH ALKALINE LIXIVIA THEN THE WHOLE IS DISSOLVED AND FORMS A TURBID SOLUTION BUT WHEN ACIDS ARE EMPLOYED THE CHIEF PART OF THE GLUTEN IS ALONE ACTED UPON AND A CONSIDERABLE RESIDUUM IS LEFT CONSISTING OF THE WVAX SOME OF THE RESIN AND A PORTION OF GLUTEN WHICH HAS BEEN PROTECTED FROM THE ACTION OF THE ACID BY THE TWO FORMER SUBSTANCES THE ABOVE PROPERTIES INDICATE A GREAT RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THIS SUBSTANCE AND THE GLUTEN OF WHEAT I THEREFORE HAVE CALLED IT GLUTEN BUT AT A FUTURE TIME I INTEND TO SUBJECT IT TO A MORE ACCURATE EXAMINATION212 MR HATCHETTS ANALYTICAL EXPERIMENTS PROPERTIES OF THE WAX OF LAC IF SHELL LAC BE LONG AND REPEATEDLY DIGESTED IN BOILING NITRIC ACID THE WHOLE IS DISSOLVED EXCEPTING THE WAX WHICH FLOATS ON THESURFACE OF THE LIQUOR LIKE OIL AND WHEN COLD MAY BE COLB LECTED OR IT MAY BE MORE EASILY OBTAINED IN A PURE STATE BY DIGESTING THE RESIDUUM LEFT BY ALCOHOL IN BOILING NITRIC ACID THE WAX THUS OBTAINED WHEN PURE IS PALE YELLOWISH WHITE AND UNLIKE BEES WAX IS DEVOID OF TENACITY AND IS EXTREMELY BRITTLE IT MELTS AT A MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURE THAN THAT OF BOILING WATER BURNS WITH A BRIGHT FLAME AND EMITS AN ODOUR SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING THAT OF SPERMACETI WATER DOES NOT ACT UPON IT NEITHER DOES COLD ALCOHOL BUT THIS LAST WLHEN BOILED PARTIALLY DISSOLVES IT AND UPON COOLING DEPOSITS THE GREATER PART A SMALL PORTION HOWEVER REMAINS IN SOLUTION AND MAY BE PRECIPITATED BY WATER SULPHUIRIC ETHER WHEN HEATED ALSO DISSOLVES IT BUT UPON COOLING NEARLY THE WHOLE IS DEPOSITED LIXIVIUIM OF POTASH WHEN BOILED WITH THE WAX FORMS A MILKY SOLUTION BUT THE CHIEF PART OF THE WAX FLOATS ON THE SURFACE IN THE STATE OF WHITE FLOCCULI AND APPEARS TO BE CONVERTED INTO A SOAP OF DIFFICULT SOLUBILITY IT IS NO LONGER INFLAMMABLE AND WITH WATER FORMS A TURBID SOLUTION FROM WHICH AS WELL AS FROM THE SOLUTION IN POTASH THE WAX MAY BE PRECIPITATED BY ACIDS AMMONIA WHEN HEATED ALSO DISSOLVES A SMALL PORTION OF THE WVAX AND FORMS A SOLUTION VERY SIMILAR TO THE FORMGER NITRIC AND MURIATIC ACIDS DO NOT SEEM TO ACT UPON THE WAX THE EFFECTS OF SULPHURIC ACID HAVE NOT BEEN EXAMINEDAND OBSERVATIONS ON LAC WHEN THE PROPERTIES OF THIS SUBSTANCE ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF BEESWAX A DIFERENCE WILL BE PERCEIVED AND ON THE CONTRARY THE MOST STRIKING ANALOGY IS EVIDENT BETWEEN THE WAX OF LAC AND THE MYRTLE WAX WHICH IS OBTAINED FROM THE MYRICA CERIFERA AN ACCOUNT OF THE LATTER SUBSTANCE HAS BEEN PUBLISHED BY DR BOSTOCK OF LIVERPOOL IN NICHOLSONS JOURNAL WITH COMPARA TIVE EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ON BEESWAX SPERMACETI ADIPOCIRE AND THE CRYSTALLINE MATTER OF BILIARY CALCULI THE PROPERTIES OF THE MYRTLE WAX AS DESCRIBED IN DR BOSTOCKS VALUABLE PAPER SO PERFECTLY COINCIDE WITH THOSE WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED IN THE WAX OF LAC THAT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER THEM AS ALMOST THE SAME SUBSTANCE INDEED I THINK THEY MAY BE REGARDED AS ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL IF SOME ALLOWANCE BE MADE FOR THE SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY THE DIFFERENT MODE OF THEIR FORMATION FROM THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSES WE FIND THAT THE VARIETIES OF LAC CONSIST OF THE FOUR SUBSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED NAMELY EXTRACTIVE COLOURING MATTER RESIRNS GLUTEN AND A PECULIAR KIND OF WAX RESIN IS THE PREDOMINANT SUBSTANCE  BUT THIS AS WELL AS THE OTHER INGREDIEENTS IS LIABLE IN A CERTAIN DEGREE TO VARIATION IN RESPECT TO QUANTITY ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSES WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED ONE HUNDRED PARTS OF EACH VARIETY OF LAC YIELDED AS FOLLOWS  NICHOLSONS JOURNAL FOR MARCH 1803 P 129AD4 MR HATCHETTS ANALYTICAL EXPERIMENTS STICK LAC RESIN  68 COLOURING EXTRACT A

THE PROPORTIONS OF THE SUBSTANCES WHICH COMPOSE THE VARIETIES OF LAC MUST HOWEVER BE SUBJECT TO VERY CONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS AND WE OUGHT THEREFORE ONLY TO CONSIDER THESE ANALYSES IN A GENERAL POINT OF VIEW HENCE WE SHOULD STATE THAT LAC CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF RESIN MIXED WITH CERTAIN PROPORTIONS OF A PECULIAR KIND OF WAX OF GLUTEN AND OF COLOURING EXTRACT THE RELATIVE QUANTITY OF THE TWO LATTER INGREDIENTS VERY CON SIDERABLY AFFECT THE CHARACTERS OF THE LACS FOR INSTANCE WE MAYAND OBSERVATIONS ON LAC 215 OBSERVE THAT THE GLUTINOUS SUBSTANCE WHEN PRESENT IN SHELL LAC IN A MORE THAN USUAL PROPORTION PROBABLY PRODUCES THE DEFECT OBSERVED IN SOME KINDS OF SEALING WAX WHICH WHEN HEATED AND BURNED BECOME BLACKENED BY PARTICLES OF COAL FOR THE GLUTEN AFFORDS MUCH OF THIS SUBSTANCE AND DOES NOT MELT LIKE THE RESIN AND WAX FROM WHAT HAS BEEN STATED THEREFORE LAC MAYBE DENOMINATED A CERORESIN MIXED WITH GLUTEN AND COLOURING EXTRACT  III GENERAL REMARKS FROM THE WHOLE OF THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN RELATED IT APPEARSTHAT ALTHOUGH LAC IS INDISPUTABLY THE PRODUCTION OF IN SECTS YET IT POSSESSES FEW OF THE CHARACTERS OF ANIMAL SUBSTANCES AND THAT THE GREATER PART OF ITS AGGREGATE PROPERTIES AS WELL AS OF ITS COMPONENT INGREDIENTS ARE SUCH AS MORE IMMEDIATELY APPERTAIN TO VEGETABLE BODIES LAC OR GUM LACAS IT IS POPULARLY BUT IMPROPERLY CALLED IS CERTAINLY A VERY USEFUL SUBSTANCE AND THE NATIVES OF INDIA FURNISH FULL PROOFS OF THIS BY THE MANY PURPOSES TO WHICH THEY APPLY IT ACCORDING TO MR KERR IT ISI MADE BY THEM INTO RINGS BEADS AND OTHER FEMALE ORNAMENTS WHEN FORMED INTO SEALINGWAX IT IS EMPLOYED AS A JAPAN AND IS LIKEWISE MANUFACTURED INTO DIFFERENT COLOURED VARNISHES THE COLOURING PART IS FORMED INTO LAKES FOR PAINTERS A SORT OF SPANISH WOOL FOR THE LADIES IS ALSO PREPARED WITH IT AND AS A DYING MATERIAL IT IS IN VERY GENERAL USE THE RESINOUS PART IS EVEN EMPLOYED TO FORM GRINDSTONES BY MDCCCIV F F216 MR IATCHETTS DNALYTICAL EXPENRMENTS MELTING IT AND MIXING WITH IT ABOUT THREE PARTS OF SAND FOR MAKING POLISHING GRINDSTONES THE SAND IS SIFTED THROUGH FINE MUSLIN BUT THOSE WHICH ARE EMPLOYED BY THE LAPIDARIES ARE FIRMED WITH POWDER OF CORUNDUM CALLED BY THEM CORUNE BUT IN ADDITION TO ALL THE ABOVE USES TO WHICH IT IS APPLIED IN INDIA AS WEFL AS TO THOSE WHICH CAUSE IT TO BE IN REQUEST IN LUROPE MR WILKINSS HINDU INK OCCUPIES A CONSPICUOUS PLACE NOT MERELY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS USE AS AN INK BUT BECAUSE IT TEACHES US TO PREPARE AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF LAC WHICH PROBABLY WILL BZO FOUND OF VERY EXTENSIVE UTILITYK THIS SOLUTION OF LAC IN WATER MAY BE ADVANTAGEOUSLY EM PLOYED AS A SORT OF VARNISH WHICH IS EQUAL IN DURABILITY AND OTHER QUALITIES TO THOSE PREPARED WITH ALCOHOL WHILST BY THE SAVING OF THIS LIQUID IT IS INFINITELY CHEAPER I DO NOT MEAN HOWEVER TO ASSERT THAT IT WILL ANSWER EQUALLY WELL IN ALL CASES BUT ONLY THAT IT MAY BE EMPLOYED IN MANY IT WILL BE FOUND LIKEWISE OF GREAT USE AS A VEHICLE FOR COLOURS FOR WHEN DRY IT IS NOT EASILY AFFECTED BY DAMP OR EVEN BY WATER WITH A SOLUTION OF THIS KIND I HAVE MIXED VARIOUS COLOURS SUCH AS VERMILLION FINE LAKE INDIGO PRUSSIAN BLUE SAP GREEN AND GAMBOGE AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT ALTHOUGH THE TWO LAST ARE OF A GUMMY NATURE AND THE OTHERS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY MIXED WITH GUM BEING CAKES OF THE PATENT WATERCOLOURS YET WHEN DRIED UPON PAPER THEY COULD NOT BE REMOVED WITH A MOISTENED SPONGE UNTIL THE SURFACE OF THE PAPER ITSELF WAS RUBBED OFF IN MANY ARTS AND MANUFACTURES THEREFORE THE SOLUTIONS OF  PHIL TRANS 1781 P 380AND OBSERVATIONS ON LAC E 17 LAC MAY BE FOUND OF MUCH UTILITY FOR LIKE MUCILAGE THEY MNAY BE DILUTED WITH WATER AND YET WHEN DRY ARE LITTLE IF AT ALL AFFECTED BY IT WE FIND FROM THE EXPERIMENTS ON LAC THAT THIS SUBSTANCE IS SOLUBLE IN THE ALKALIS AND IN SOME OF THE ACIDS BUT THIS FACT CONSIDERING THAT RESIN IS THE PRINCIPAL INGREDIENT OF LAC IS IN OPPOSITION TO THE GENERALLY RECEIVED OPINION OF CHEMISTS NAMELY THAT ACIDS AND ALKALIS DO NOT ACT UPON RESINOUS BODIES SOME EXPERIMENTS HOWEVER WHICH I HAVE MADE ON VARIOUS RESINS GUMRESINS AND BALSAMS FULLY ESTABLISH THAT THESE SUBSTANCES ARE POWERFULLY ACTED UPON BY THE ALKALIS AND BY SOME OF THE ACIDS SO AS TO BE COMPLETELY DISSOLVED AND RENDERED SOLUBLE IN WATER IT WILL BE A VERY WIDE AND CURIOUS FIELD OF INQUIRY TO DISCOVER WHAT CHANGES ARE THUS PRODUCED IN THESE BODIES ESPECIALLY BY NITRIC ACID EACH SUBSTANCE MUST FORM THE SUBJECT OF A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION AND THERE CANNOT BE A DOUBT BUT THAT MUCH WILL BE LEARNED RESPECTING THEIR NATURE AND PROPERTIES WHICH HITHERTO HAVE BEEN SO LITTLE EXAMINED BY CHEMISTS THE ALKALINE SOLUTIONS OF RESIN MAY BE FOUND USEFUL IN SOME OF THE ARTS FOR MANY COLOURS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH ARE METALLIC  THE ALKALINE SOLUTIONS OF LAC ARE EVIDENTLY OF A SAPONLCCOUS NATURE AND LIKE OTHER SOAPS MAY BE DECOMPOSED BY ACIDS THE ENTIRE SUBSTANCE OF LAC IS NOT HOWEVER COMPLETELY DISSOLVED AS APPEARS FROM THE TURBIDNESS OF THE LIQUORS THREE OF THE FOUR INGREDIENTS NAMELY THE RESIN THE GLUTEN AND THE COLOURIIAG EXTRACT APPEAR TO BE IN PERFECT SOLUTION WHILST THE WAX IS ONLY PARTIALLY COMBINED WITH THE ALKALI AND FORMS THAT IMPERFECTLY SOLUBLE SAPONACEOUS COMPOUND WHICH HAS BEEN FORMERLY MEN TIONED AND WHICH REMAINS SUSPENDED AND DISTURBS THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE SOLUTION FROM VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES IT DOES NOT SEEM IMPROBABLE THAT THE LONG SOUGHT FOR BUT HITHERTO UNDISCOVERED VEHICLE EMPLOYED BY THE CELEBRATED PAINTERS OF THE VENETIAN SCHOOL MAY HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF RESINOUS SOLUTION PREPARED BY MEANS OF BORAX OR BY THE ALKALIS FF2MR HATCHETTS ANALYTICAL E ISMENTS C WHEN DISSOLVED IN ACIDS MAY BE PRECIPITATED COMBINED WITH RESIN BY ADDING THE FORMER TO THE ALKALINE SOLUTIONS OF THE LATTER I HAVE MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS OF THIS KIND WITH SUCCESS AND PERHAPS THESE PROCESSES MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO DYERS AND MANUS FACTURERS OF COLOURS IT IS PROBABLE ALSO THAT MEDICINE MAY DERIVE ADVANTAGES FROM SOME OF THIS EXTENSIVE SERIES OF ALKALINE AND ACID SOLUTIONS OF THE RESINOUS SUBSTANCES

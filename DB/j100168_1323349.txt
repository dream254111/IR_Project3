formally been entered against the bankrupt in bastardy proceedings brougrit in the name of the State adjudging him to pay a monthly sum to the mother for the maintenance of the child fieldi that such a judgmnent debt is not released by the discharge in bankruptcy Re Bakeir 96 Fed Rep 954 Dist Ct Kaln The Bankruptcy Act of 1898  63 a provides more explicitly than former bank ruptcy acts that  all debts of the bankrupt which are a fixed liability as evidenced by a judgment shall be discharged The j udgmenit debt in the principal case is within the letter of this provision but not within the intendment It is well established in bankruptcy law that however genieral the words of the statute a judgment for a penalty etntered in criminal proceedinigs is not discharged Re Sutherlanid Deady 4T6 Spauldin v New York 4 IOW 2I To hold otherwise would allow the bank ruptcy courts to remit penalties for crimes In the principal case the proceedings were quasicriminial but the same principles should apply It could nlever have been contemplated that the bankruptcy courts should discharge the putative father of the continiuing obligation imposed by a judgment in such proceedings Re Cotton Fed Cas No 3269 And the court in the principal case is accurate in giving a limited construction to the provision in question BANKRUPTCYPREFERENCESADVANCES UPON BOTH PAST AND PRESENT CONSIDERATION  A creditor of an insolvent banker had 1300 on deposit with him He then advanced r90o more and received in return collateral securities to the amount of 7000 for both amounts Held that as to 1300 the transaction is a preference and voidable but as to I9oo the transfer is for a present fair consideration and valid Re Cobb 96 Fed Rep 82I Dist Ct N C The Bankruptcy Act of I898  6o a provides that all preferences shall be void able But a transfer founided upon a present and adequate consideration is not con sidered a preference Tiffany v Lucas I5 Wall 421 Clark v Iselin 21 Wall 360 The truly difficult question and one on which there is a remarkable conflict of authority arises where the security given is for both past and present advances Many cases hold that the transaction being voidable in part must be voidable as to the whole Denny v Dania 56 Mass I60 Tuttle v Truax I Nat Bank Reg 6oi  Scannon v Hobson Fed Cas No 12434 But other cases hold that the transaction is separable Ex parte Ames I Lowell 561 Re Stowe 6 Nat Bank Reg 429 Crampton v Tar bell Fed Cas No 3349 The former cases however fail to recognize the distinction between a fraudulent coniveyance and a preference Now fraud is not essential to the conception of a preferenice Accordingly there is no reason why the transfer should not be separated into its voidable and valid parts as was done in the latter cases and the decision in the principal case is to be commended BILLS AND NOTES  ALTERATION  PRESUMPTION OF FRAUD  The payee sued to recover the consideration of a note which had been materially altered while in his possession feld that there is a presumption which the plaintiff has not rebutted that the alteration is fraudulent and hence the action will not lie Maguire v Eichmeier 8o N W Rep 395 Iowa It is well settled that a fraudulent alteration of a note by the payee extinguishes both the note and the liability for which it was given Smith v Mace 44 N H 553 Wheelock v Freemnan 30 Mass I65 But there is authority for the doctrine that unless the alteration is shown to have been made with fraudulent intent the payee may recover the original cotnsideration Vogle v Ripper 34 Ill IOO The prevailing rule however is stated by the principal case Wtzrder Co v Willyard 46 Minn 531 2 Dan Neg Ins 4th ed  I412 It is certainly fair to call upon the party who made the alterations for all necessary explanationis but it is unnecessary and misleading to put the rule in the form of a presumption If a note is given on account of a debt the right of action on the debt is suspended Kearslake v Morgan 5 T R 513 And it seems clear that if the creditor wishes to take advantage of the original liability it is for him to show that the security has become unavailable without his fault It is simply a quiestion of the burden of proof BILLS AND NOTES  NOTES OF UNREGISTERED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS  A note was executed in Teninessee in favor of and as part of a transaction with an Ohio corporation which had not complied with the statutes regulating the terms on which foreign corporations may do business in Tennessee Held that the note is unenforce able in the hanlds of a purchaser for value without notice First Nat Bank of Mar sillon v Coughron 52 S W Rep II12 Tenn Ch App As the statutes in question do not expressly make such notes void the better view is that they are enforceable by holders for value without notice Williams v Cheney 69 Mass 215 The principal case rests on a dictum in an earlier Tennessee case410 HARVARD LAW REVIEW Snoddly v Ameican ANt Bank 88 Tenn 573 that notes given in consideration of a contract against morals public policv and public statutes are void in any hands citing 2 Am and Eng Enc Law ist ed 368 and notes The reference supports the posi tion taken but an examination of the cases cited discloses that they are all either based on statutes making the notes void or are cases between the original parties to the transaction The later edition of the Encyclopedia states the correct view 4 Am and Eng Enc Law 2d ed 192 The principal case illustrates the danger of relying on dicta and statemenits in the digests without a careful examination of the cases CARRIERS  CONTRACT LIMITING LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE  Held that a carrier canniot by contract limit his liability for injuries caused by his negligence to a value set by the shipper Cincinnati etc R R Cos Receiver v Graves 52 S W Rep 961 Ky Contracts purporting to limit to an agreed valuation the liability of the carrier for losses occurring through his negligence appear to fall into three classes First where the carrier prints in his bill of ladinig a limit to the liability assumed Such stipulations are generally held to be against public policy and void Bleack v Goodrich Transfiorta tion Co 55 Wis 319 Second where the liability is limited to a certain sum unless a higher value is stated by the shipper Here the authorities are in conflict but the weight perhaps is that the carrier cannot limit his liability by the mere inaction of the shipper Southern Exxp Co v Seide 67 Miss 6o9 Third where as in the principal case the shipper sets a value which is written into the bill of lading Here clearly there is no reason in public policy against the contract as the shipper is not at a dis advantage in his dealinig with the carrier The agreement is virtually one for liquida tion of damages and should be enforced hlarvey v Terre Haute etc R R 74 Mo 538 CONSTrTUTIONAL LAW  RESTRICTTON OF HEIGHT OF BUILDINGS  Held that a statute setting a limitation upon the height of buildings

restitution of the purchasemonev and compensation for improvements Ellis v Ellis D Dev Eq 341 Ridley v AcNairy 2 Humph 174 Box v Staiford 21 Miss 93 That such a rtule will often fail to do justice

has made a full disclosure of all the facts he knows concerning the subject matter Ex patte Lacey 6 Ves 625 Wardell v Union Pacifc  R 103 U S 651 But the court in the principal case held that the plaintiff could not succeed because the lanid had been worked and it was therefore impossible to restore the parties to their origilnal position The principle invoked however is not ani absolute bar

theRECENT CASES 4II parties are not restored to their original position Erlanger v New Sombrero Phzos phate Co L R 3 App Cas 1278 Hence the opinion of a dissenting judge in the prin cilpal case seems preferable Practical justice would be done if the defenldants were put in the same position as if they had worked the land themselves The plaintiff should theni begiven a decree for the purchase price of the land less the profits the company made in working it CORPORATIONS  STOCKHOLDERS RIGHT TO INSPECT CORPORATE RECORDS The relator a stockholder applied for a writ of manzdanzus to compel the defendant corporation to allow her to inspect its records alleging that she was desirous of learning the condition of the company and the manner in which it had been managed Held that a maizdamus is properly granted State v Pacjftc Brewing etc Co 58 Pac Rep 584 Wash The Euiglish courts in the absence of statutory provisions conifine the right of a stockholder to inspect corporate records to cases in which there is a dispute pelndilng betweeni himself and the corporation or other stockholders or where the purpose of the inspection is to ascertaini whether he can raise a particular case in his favor Rex v Merchant Tailors Co 2 B  Ad II5 The objection to a more general right is that frequent examinations might interfere with the successful conduct of the busi ness of the company The English

full value of the goods he has gained no advantage for himself but must hold the enitire sum for the benefit of the bailor flays v Riddle I Sarldf 248 2 Sedg Dam 7th ed 394 The view in the principal

authority Crawford v Southern Ry Co 34 S E Rep 8o S C The court got rid of the objection of hearsay on the ground that the admissions of an agent within the scope of his authority are the admissions of the principal and so not hearsay The correctness of this proposition cannot be doubted Fairlie v Has tings IO Ves 123 United States v Golding 12 Wheat 460 But the assertion that the admission in

containied a provision that the same should be incontestable after the lapse of a year In an action on the policy at the expiration of a year held that the holder cannot recover Anctil v ManufacturersL Le Ins Co I899 App Cas 604 Public policy and expediency require that the assured should have an insurable interest in the thing insured Goddart v Garrett 2 Vern 269 Hence the insurer cannot waive a defence founded on the lack of such an interest on the part of the policy holder Agricultural Ins Co v AMontague 38 Mich 548 Moreover it has been held that a provision of incontestability amounts to a waiver in advance of all defences that the company can waive Massachusetts Benefit etc Co v Robinson 104 Ga 256 and it seems fair to say that it should leave open all others On these grounds the principal case deserves to be supported It has been held however that the only effect of a clause of incontestability like that in the principal case is to establish a short period of limitation for setting up all kinds of defences and that one who has not an insur able interest may recover after the period expires Wright v Mutual etc Assn of America II8 N V 237 But obviously such a view leads to the sanction of wager policies and allows the general principles of public policy and expediency to be defeated by the private arrangement of the parties PARTNERSHIP

that mere alienation of the husbands affections does not constitute a cause of action for the wife but there must be also a loss of the consortium Neville v Gile 54 N E Rep 841 Mass Houhton v Rice 54 N E Rep 843 Mass These decisions apparently require aii actual separation of the husband from the home before the wifes cause of action accrues Since the passage of statutes allowilng married women to sue alone there seems to be no reason why the wifes rights against third parties for initerference with the marriage relations should not be equally extelnsive with those of the husband This view is taken by the great weight of authority Foot v Cazrd 58 Conn I Bennett v Bennett I 16 N Y 586 It has been held in several jurisdictions that a husband may mainttain an actioni for the mere alienation of his wifes affections without her separation from the home Herrmance v James 47 Barb 120 Rinehirt v Bills 82 Mo 534 The justice of these decisions can hardly be doubted for the personal injury to the husband or wife and the violation of the security of the family relations may be just as great when the discordant element remains as when he or she abandons the home The principal cases appear then to be against the better policy and opposed to the trend of niodern authorities See I Bish Mar Div and Separ  1361 PROCEDUREEFFECT OF JUDGMENT AGAINST GARNISHEE The plaintiff ob tained judgmenit against the defendant and also against a garnishee in the same action The defendant having paid into court the differenice between the judgment against the garnishee and that against himself held that he is entitled to have the judgment againist himself discharged as satisfied Bowen v Port Huron Co 8o N W Rep 345 Iowa The proposition by which it is sought tosupport this questionable result is in effect that the judgment against a garnishee is equivalent to a levy on the defendants prop erty Even admitting this to be true it does not justify the decision reached for while a levy on property sufficient to satisfy the debt may operate to suspend further remedies while it is in force it is nowhere held that it extinguishes the judgment First Nat Bank of Hastings v Rogers 13 Minn 407 2 Freem Judg 4th ed  475 To approach the question from another standpoint clearly it was never intended that garnishment statutes should force the party who takes advantage of them to accept the liability of some third person as a substitute for that of his debtor The judgment against a garnishee is in the nature of collateral security for the satisfaction of the principals obligation It is subordinate and incidental to the judgment against the defendant and it is difficult to find any principle by which it could become a ground for discharging his liability Roberthon v Norroy i Dyer 83 I Freem Judg

land supported extends only to the land in its unimproved state But admitting that the land in its natural state would have fallen there is a conflict of autliority as to whether the damages should include incidental injury to structures thereon In England and one or two of the states the rule of the principal case is followed Brown v Robins 4 H  N i86 Stearns Exec v City of Richmond 88 Va 992

25 N J Law 356 Richardson v Ver mont Central R R Co 25 Vt 465 The doctrine established in the latter cases is preferable although as a matter of legal principle no decided advantage can be claimed for

is not an absolute right Although the court confines its decision to the exact facts of the case the logical outcome of abandoning the doctrinie of absolute ownership in percolating waters would seem to lead to the result reached in Bassett v Salisbury Mf  Co 43 N H 569 that the right to use such waters should be restricted to reasonable limits This comes nearer to practical justice than any other

parties the property was released Held that the sureties are discharged Atnip v Tennzessee Mfg Co 52 S W Rep I093 Tenn Ch App In Tennessee a levy on personal property vests the title in the officer making it and if the property seized is sufficient to satisfy the demand the levy is in law a satisfaction of the judgment Evans v Bazrzes 2 Swan 292 Pigg v Sparrow 3 Hayw Tenn i4 The application of this anomalous doctrine seems to have been abandoned in cases where the property levied on has been released and in such cases it is held that the levy does not amount to a satisfaction Telford v Cox 15 Lea 298 But as to whether the surety is bound in the latter case the Tennessee decisions differ To the effect that he is discharged is Sypert v Frazier I Tenn Cas 557 The court however reached the opposite result in Fry v Manlove I Baxt 256 If the levy where there is a subse quent release is no satisfaction of the principal debtors obligation it is difficult to see why it should discharge the surety The latter clearly has no legal defence against the creditor and there seems to be no ground for raising an equitable defence in his favor Therefore with cases on either side the decision of

the remedy employed but on principle a valid objection to it cannot be raised Clearly the defendant in thus deliberately depriving the plaintiff of his lien upon the land has done a wrongful act for which he should answer in damages However permissible in theory this form of action will not always prove valuable in practice for the plaintiff has lost his security only and not his debt and if the

authority as a mere agent and does not become a debtor till the paper is paid Scott v Ocean Bank 23 N Y 289 Phanix Bank v Risley I I f U S 125 It does not seem that the additional fact in the principal case where the depositor was allowed to draw against the check before collection should alter the relation of the parties Such a permission is extended as a courtesv and the transaction really amounts to a loan by the bank on the security of the check The authorities however are about equally divided In agreement with this line of reasoning is Balbach v Frelinglz uysen i5 Fed Rep 675 Cir Ct N J Contra Hoffnman v Pirst Vational Bank 46 N J Law 604 The view in the principal case results in makinig the defendant a guarantor not only of the safety of the check while in his possession or that of his agents but also of its collectibility Such an extreme liability should hardly in reason be imposed as a result of the nature of the transaction Gaden v New Fouzndland Savintgs Bank I899

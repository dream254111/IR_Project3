expend ing energy velocities relative to the earth may of course be ignored There is as I now see a great advantage in making the simpler investigation first for as Dr Kimball has clearly shown as soon as we recognize the fact that the birds motion relative to the medium depends only on their relative velocity it becomes clear that gain of elevation and consequently the whole phenomenon of soaring is impossible in a uniform horizontal wind It follows that there was an error in my theory of soaring Mr Gilbert thinks it due in part to my assuming it to be possible for a bird to glide in a wind moving faster than itself with its head to leeward but I see no reason why birds should not accomplish this fact and am satisfied that I have often seen them do it He also holds that my bird in passing from a negative velocity relative to the air to a positive velocity relative to the air must pass through the phase of no velocity relative to the air in which he is practically helpless But I was dealing with the birds component velocity in the line of the winds motion and he might always have a velocity relative to the air though its component in that line might be zero The error which I made was in assuming that under the conditions of flight to which I subjected my bird the turn to leeward was possible From the way in which I made him fly it is clear that the resultant force exerted on him at every point of his supposed path must be upward and to leeward That being the case the turn to leeward could not be accomplished and consequently the path he was supposed to describe was an impossible path I feel that I must apologize to those of your readers who may have followed me in what may fitly be called  a wildgoose chase J G MACGREGOR Dalhousie College Halifax NS March 8  Shall We Teach Geology  IN Professor Winchells remarks on my review of his recent work there are only two points that call for reply First as to the study of history which according to him trains no faculty but verbal memory He now says that his  criticisms on history con template it as a study urged upon children in the early stages of education and that in the colleges it is pursued in a better way But even if imperfectly taught history trains far more important faculties than verbal memory It exercises the intellect generally quite as much as geology does and it also calls into play the moral judgment and the sympathies which geology does not To Pro fessor Winchell the old red sandstone may be a more important topic of study than the Roman Empire and the plesiosaurus a more interesting object of contemplation than Washington or Columbus but to the mass of men this is not so As to the time that Professor Winchell would have spent on geology I may have misapprehended his meaning and if so I am glad to be cor rected I havent his book by me at present but if I remember rightly he says that the study ought to be taken up in the primary schools and continued through the various grades which I under stood to mean that the subject should be studied more or less every year He now says that he only wants it taken up several times at intervals and not pursued continuously which is more moderate I do not see however how even so much study of geology is pos sible because not to speak of languages and literature there are many sciences of greater importance than geology which ought therefore to be studied first Such are arithmetic and geometry geography physics human physiology psychology ethics civil polity and history and I do not see how even all of these can be taught in the public schools If these views are correct geology can be nothing but an optional study in the high schools and col leges while in the lower schools it can have no proper place THE REVIEWER Curves of Literary Style IN the interesting researches on this subject by Professor Men denhall described in your journal in I887 words were classified according to the number of letters in them and curves made ac VOL XIII No 320 cordingly As he pointed out there are many ways in which the principle of his method may be applied and I have lately thought some instructive results might be obtained from examining sen tences with regard to length as measured by the number of words Length of sentences is a matter in which pronounced styles differ greatly Doubtless this is associated with psychological peculiari ties which it might be instructive to inquire into The mental machine so to speak which for example turns out the long par enthetical sentences of Gladstone must be very different in design from that which yields the simple and direct utterances of John Bright I have made an examination of 300 sentences in each of the fol lowing works Carlyles  French Revolution De Quinceys  Confessions and Johnsons Rambler The number of words in each sentence was counted and the sentences grouped accord ingly Then the sentences with words up to 10 were added to gether those with words from 10 to 20 from 20 to 30 and so on The accompanying curves were then obtained from these data Let it be clearly understood what they mean The plain line curve for Carlyle means that in the 300 sentences of the pas sage selected there were 62 containing words varying in number up to 10 while oo00 had from 10 to 20 and so on The result is roughly as we might expect short sentences form the bulk of the Carlyle passage his maximum being in the class 10 to 20 and sentences of more than 50 words are comparatively few There are none beyond Ioo De Quincey and Johnson on the other PO

abundance of longer sentences De Quinceys most numerous class is that of 20 to 30 words Johnsons 30 to 40 But the curve of the former does not die down till after IIO to 120 words really there was one inordinate sentence of 170 not shown in the diagram while Johnsons is further protracted to 130 to 140 I do not affirm the constancy of these curves they only apply to the specified passages of 300 sentences These few lines are merely by way of suggestion and should any reader have the time and patience to pursue the inquiry further he might I think find his labors not without some useful results It might be useful to see in what degree these curves approximate to constancy or come short of it One would like to know better than we do at present how far the method in any of its forms is reliable or helpful in settling disputed questions of authorship or in tracing anonymous literature to its source I would suggest an examination of the words used by speakers or writers as likely to be instructive A B M London March 7 WindVelocity and WindPressure FROM time to time there have appeared discussions of these questions so important to the practical engineer It seems prob able that the first of these as far as relates to the relation between windmovement and the travel of the cups of Robinsons anemom eter is soon to be definitely settled by indubitable experiments  r  ISCIENCE Professor Robinson first considered that the cups moved with one third the windvelocity but this has been repeatedly called in question In later times the more common method of investiga tion has been by whirling the anemometer on arms from I I to 35 feet in length It would seem as though arms of II feet could hardly give satisfactory results In discussions of this relation the utmost confusion has arisen by wrongly considering the socalled anemometer factor and by making the same an entirely different quantity and one from which it was supposed a  friction constant had been separated The statement that anemometers used in this country give 20 per cent too great Windmovement has been based on this misconception Let x  anemometer factor w  windmovement and v  travel of the cups we have w X  I V Let a  friction constant and b  another constant we have w  a  bv 2 Substituting the value of v in i we have bw x   3 w  a In experiments at St Petersburg it was found that an anemometer with 672inch arms and 4inch cups the same as used in this country had b  247 and a  about 2 miles per hour Assum ing w at various velocities 5 Io 15 20 and 25 we obtain from 3 for x 41I2 309 285 274 and 268 respectively We see that even these earlier investigations show our anemom eter with factor 3 almost exactly correct for velocities from 10 to 15 miles per hour while at less velocities it gives too little wind and only about I2 per cent too much at 25 miles The wind records of this country had been so often called in question the chief signalofficer finally made provision for an in vestigation of the question The results in full will shortly be published For our present purpose it will suffice to give the ap proximate results with our own anemometer described above with w at 5 10 15 20 and 25 we obtain for x 330 3II 305 298 and 289 respectively These are very satisfactory and show that except for high or low winds the records are entirely correct It is rather singular that investigations have recently been made in England with a whirling arm of 29 feet almost the same as that used in this country 28 feet Unfortunately these experiments were made in the open air and with a natural wind often 4 miles per hour These currents vitiated all the results for velocities less than 30 miles per hour in some cases the error amounted to 35 per cent The helicoidal anemometer which was tested had a vane attached to keep it in the wind It is of the same nature as the  airmeter long since discarded for wind measurement and only used for straightline currents in mines or elsewhere For tunately in these experiments there was one day when it was nearly calm and the results for that day do not differ from others made in a closed court For velocities less than 25 miles per hour these results are entirely unreliable and misleading in the present state of our knowledge of the problem An extended discussion of this question will be found in the American Meteorological Jour nal for March While much time has been expended on the above problem yet much more has been spent in determining the relation between the velocity and pressure of the wind This problem is by far the more difficult to solve and to practical engineers the more impor tant of the two One thing is very gratifying and that is that the investigations and practice so far have been almost entirely on the safe side and the wonder is that buildings have blown down at all at least if engineers have ever allowed the commonly ac cepted figures to enter their computations It is probable that in most cases engineers have assured themselves of a factor of safety far beyond any thing that any experiments have indicated How is it that if as some claim the usual deductions have indi cated three times too great pressure of the wind any building has ever blown down  If we examine the matter however we shall find that most of the theoretical discussions when separated from wellconducted investigations will lead and have led far astray One 227 of the most astonishing misapplications has been of Hagens ex periments made with plates from 2 to 6 inches square at velocities from I to 4 miles per hour to the side of a house 400 inches square and with velocities of 60 or 70 miles per hour But this is not all Even Hagens experiments are repudiated by those very persons who make this application for the reason that they give an increas ing pressure as the plate grows larger so that with a house 400 inches square the pressure according to Hagens formula would be seven times as great per square foot as on a plate 4 inches square Certainly it would be very unscientific to discard the ap plication of a formula where it does not seem satisfactory and then apply the computation at another portion of the formula to that  portion where we have discarded the same formula The best experiments with low velocities show no increase in pressure per square foot for plates from 4 to 24 inches square and when plates have been exposed to the free wind or at very high velocities the result has shown p  005 sw2 in whichj  pressure s  surface in square feet and w  velocity of wind in miles per hour The recent English experiments were with a plate 6 inches square and even if they were not vitiated by untoward causes it would be utterly impossible to reason from them to what the pressure would be on a surface four thousand times as great H A HAZEN Washington March I8 Queries 44 EQUILIBRIUM In the account of his travels in the Colo nies the Marquis de Chastellux relates that while at Albany Jan I 1782 he was surprised at the noise and racket with which the new year was ushered in young folks servants and even negroes going from tavern to tavern singing and asking for drink New Years morning he took leave of Gen Clinton and adds I met nothing but drunken people jn the streets but what astonished me most was to see them not only walk but run ujpon the ice without falling or making a false

his narrative as well as being the most interesting pfirivate view of our country at that critical period is also the most trustworthy asserting that in some way a drunken person or one not having to the fullest degree what we may call selfcontrol has a decided advantage over his sup posed clearerheaded brother who has refrained from the  flowing bowl Is this actually the case or is the advantage more appar ent than real  Most of us have at some time noticed the truly wonderful balancings of a drunken person when in proximity to a curb or flight of stairs and have commented thereon that a person conscious of the position could not imitate these contortions with out danger to life and limb Does extreme mental alertness then act as a detriment while a blunted sensibility is an advantage to the person so conditioned  If so the question becomes an impor tant one and not confined to conditions of selfimposed disability We may need to know definitely at certain critical periods whether in order to accomplish a given object it is better that we should be partially blindfolded than that we should see and know all A M Indianapolis Ind March I3 Answers 42 LOOKING TO THE LEFT In answer

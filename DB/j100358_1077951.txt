educational accessory is a relatively recent affair The first chemical laboratoryprobably the first laboratory open to studentswas that of Liebig at Giessen estab lished shortly after 1824 Harvard University opened its first laboratory for students in 1846 The laboratory appeared as an adjunct of the high school less than a halfcentury since and even yet it is by no means in universal use The advantages that have been claimed for the laboratory method in science instruction are many i It affords opportunity for firsthand contact with materials and processes and thus leaves concepts in the mind of the pupil that are much more accurate and clearcut than can be attained by information won from descriptions and pictures What a revelation for instance are active living cells like amoebae to the student who has formed his preconception of such objects from his reading only 2 It imparts information in a very effective way so that the pupil retains the knowledge much better than when he acquires it by other methods of instruction 3 It gives opportunity for a very complete type of reflective thinking in solving problems The student may collect his own facts devise his own hypotheses test them out and form his own judgment Drill in this sort of thing tends to develop good habits of scientific thinking and ideals of its practicability and applicability to all situations together with selfreliance in the formulation of opinions Good types of the solution of a problem by reflective thinking are familiar in such things as Pasteurs successful attempt to avert the menace of the silkwork disease or the modern physi cists revelations concerning the nature of radium 646SUPERVISED STUDY AND THE SCIENCE LABORATORY 647 4 It is a psychologically correct method taking advantage of the pupils instinctive curiosity and his inherent activity to arouse native interests and hold attention by manual and sensory effort so as to carry over into sustained acquired interest and a will to grasp the more fundamental concepts and principles 5 It may develop a very desirable type of skill This is a relatively unimportant factor in the highschool scientific studies The medical school illustrates it in the skill it imparts to the em bryo physician in the dissectingroom the engineering school in the skill it gives in the analytical laboratories The highschool shop is a type of laboratory that does give a serviceable skill to the highschool pupil These and other things have been stressed as the chief ends to be achieved in laboratory work possibly these are the most important It is needless to inquire which one is the most essential all are worth while all may be achieved Teachers of science have not been slow to see that the adoption of the laboratory method does not of necessity insure good teaching Indeed the multiplication of apparatus and the consequent added responsibility of its successful care and administration often make the laboratory a handicap to a fairly successful instructor To relieve the teacher of the added burden and to enable him to supervise the work of large laboratory sections resort has been had to various devices notably the laboratory assistant and the laboratory guide Certain considerations will make apparent the dangers accruing from these substitutes for the personal guidance of the teacher Laboratory work is essentially supervised study It is interest ing to note that as supervised study is introduced as a feature of other subjects in the high schools the periods are quite invariably lengthened often doubled so as to allow the teacher time to give that individual attention so essential to the success of the method Moreover there appear almost certainly directions and outlines for study quite comparable to those of the scientific laboratory which have so often formalized and deadened the laboratory work that in many cases a return to the lecturedemonstration method would be a vast improvement648 THE SCHOOL REVIEW As long as it is conceived that the chief function of the laboratory is to bring the student in contact with concrete material then a laboratory assistant with sufficient intelligence to set things out and put them away in an orderly fashion and printed directions for the manipulation of the apparatus are adequate If information is the end sought the laboratory guide may be sufficient to state the facts and principles and the assistant with its aid may direct the process of their verification It is to be noted that the laboratory method of acquiring information is very wasteful of time It is justifiable only when the concepts in volved are new and need clarifying by contact with the materials or occasionally when an important principle may be simply demon strated by the students experimentation Most information if the student really has need for it is most economically acquired either from books or from lectures But when we conceive of the laboratory as a place where real problems are discovered and solved in order that the pupil may be habituated to proper methods of reflective thinking where ideals may be established so that the scientific attitude of mind will carry over into lifes problems outside the laboratory then it is evident that nothing must come between the nascent mind of the pupil and the contagious and enthusiastic ability of the teacher This aim of science instruction is one of the most fundamental in democracyto habituate pupils to reason to correct conclusions on the basis of observed fact rather than to hold opinions based on whims fancy myths and prejudice The best feature of the laboratory is therefore the opportunity it affords for the intimate give and take between pupil and teacher when the teacher can supervise the steps in the students thinking see that they are logical criticize errors stimulate enthusiasm and the student can ask for assistance at the points where he finds himself flounder ing This is so essential in secondaryschool work at least that the wise teacher prizes highly his chances for this sort of supervised study and even in the advanced work of college or university where the information aim is much more important the wide awake student finds fault if he is turned over to the inexperience of the laboratory assistantSUPERVISED STUDY AND THE SCIENCE LABORATORY 649 Drill in productive thinking can be accomplished only when the work is presented in problem form A problem is the only justifi cation for contact with materials and absorption of knowledge When the pupil can be started on a problem that seems real to him he is positively chemotropic for relevant facts and has a keen appe tite for all knowledge that has a bearing on its solution Observa tion for observations sake is inane and worthless an accumulation of fact is a rubbish heap unless assimilated to nourish some growing idea Briefly then efficient laboratory work deals with commonplace materials that have direct economic and social values and inherent interest for the pupil It directs observation toward the accumula tion of the facts in order that some problems vital to the pupil and therefore socially worth while may be solved It aims to habituate the pupil to solve problems under wise supervision by reflective thinking on a basis of observed fact to establish an ideal of the scientific method of attack on problems and to carry the method over into related questions that concern the boy and girl It tries to equip the immature mind with the problemseeing problem solving attitude of mind as a permanent tool of inquiry Laboratory work must needs begin with simple problems well within the pupils comprehension and with his problems not some propounded to him The organization of science instruction must be from the point of view of the pupil not from that of a specialist The scientist has been slow to recognize that there is a possible science of the pedagogy of science possible I say for it is still largely a field for investigation although substantial beginnings have been made Laboratory work must be so organized as to increase in diffi culty as the pupil increases in mental power We need some scale of hardness to test out the difficulty of topics in all our highschool sciences and to give us some really scientific data on the subject to replace our a priori conception of what the pupil ought to find easy In fact the records of failures in final examinations and of failures in collegeentrance examinations would seem to indicate that we have no notion even a hazy one regarding the scientific problems that are within the grasp of the average highschool pupil650 THE SCHOOL REVIEW But there is another element to be considered in estimating the difficulty of a course besides the inherent difficulty of the pre scribed subjectmatterthat of the manner of presentation In laboratory work this is as a rule hopelessly monotonous and often it entirely ignores the essence of the whole thing the problem type of organization The experiment is set out for the student with no statement of the problem to be solved often with directions so formulated that the results are implied hence giving no opportu nity for the student to gain in problemsolving power An experi ment is not an experiment unless it aims at the settlement of a dubious point Most socalled experiments are demonstrations The laboratory guide is prone to become a receipt book and the teaching based upon it has been dubbed the cookbook style It scarcely deserves the appellation for it even lacks the satisfaction of an edible product This does not imply that all of the subject matter must be presented in problem form Much may be given as textbook work to be learned much by lecture and demonstra tion much drawn from the previous experience of the pupil now merely to be reorganized for present purposes But some of the work should be in problem form for the avowed purpose of giving drill in problem solution Such problems should be real problems and the solution should not be written across the face The average textbook or laboratory guide presents its prob lems in a stereotyped way that decreases rather than increases the pupils selfreliance The formula is monotonously the same from start to finish Statement of problem Apparatus supplied Directions for proceeding Results obtained Conclusions to be drawn It would be a marked improvement gradually to cut out the props helping the pupil generously at first to take the successive steps all of which are difficult and then gradually teach him to go it alone until he is given some problems to solve unaided and finally is called on to make a survey of material in order to find defineSUPERVISED STUDY AND THE SCIENCE LABORATORY 651 and solve his own problems This is no chimerical fancy it is actually being done in some of the best highschool teaching SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY I

colleges of the United States August 28 1918 the general plans under which the Students Army Training Corps will operate this year were outlined Among the most important statements were the fol lowing 1 All young men who were planning to go to school this fall should carry out their plans and do so Each should go to the college of his choice matriculate and enter as a regular student He will of course also register with his local board on the registration day set by the President As soon as possible after registration day probably on or about October first opportunity will be given for all the regularlyenrolled students to be inducted into the iStudents Army Training Corps at the schools where they are in attendance Thus the Corps will be organized by voluntary induction under the Selective Service Act instead of by en listment as previously contemplated The student by voluntary induction becomes a soldier in the United States Army uniformed sub ject to military discipline and with the pay of a private They will simultaneously be placed on full active duty and contracts will be made as soon as possible with the colleges for the housing sub sistence and instruction of the student soldiers 2 Officers uniforms rifles and such other equip ment as may be available will be furnished by the War Department as previously announced 3 The studentsoldiers will be given military instruction under officers of the Army and will be kept under observation and test to determine their qualification as officercandidates and technical ex perts such as engineers chemists and doctors After a certain period the men will be selected according to their performance and assigned to military duty in one of the following ways a He may be transferred to a central officers training camp b He may be transferred to a noncommis sioned officers training school c He may be assigned to the school where he is enrolled for further intensive work in a specified line for a limited specified time d He may be assigned to the vocational train ing section of the corps for technician training of military value e He may be transferred to a cantonment for duty with troops as a private 4 Similar sorting and reassignment of the men will be made at periodical intervals as the re quirements of the service demand It can not be now definitely stated how long a particular student will remain at college This will depend on the re quirements of the mobilization and the age group to which he belongs In order to keep the unit at adequate strength men will be admitted from sec ondary schools or transferred from Depot Brigades as the need may require 5 No units of the Students Army Training Corps will for the present be established at sec ondary schools but it is hoped to provide at an early date for the extension of military instruction in such schools The secondary schools are urged to intensify their instruction so that young men seventeen and eighteen years old may be qualified to enter college as promptly as possible 6 There will be both a collegiate section and vocational section of the Students Army Train ing Corps Young men of draft age of grammar school education will be given opportunity to enter the vocational section of the corps At present about 27500 men are called for this section each month Application for voluntary induction into the vocational section should be made to the local board and an effort will be made to accommodate as many as possible of those who volunteer for this training Men in the vocational section will be rated and tested by the standard Army methods and those who are found to possess the requisite qualifica tions may be assigned to further training in the collegiate section 7 In view of the comparatively short time dur ing which most of the studentsoldiers will remain in college and the exacting military duties await ing them academic instruction must necessarily be modified along lines of direct military value The War Department will prescribe or suggest such modifications The schedule of purely military in struction will not preclude effective academic work It will vary to some extent in accordance with the type of academic instruction e g will be less in a medical school than in a college of liberal arts 8 The primary purpose of the Students Army Training Corps is to utilize the executive and teach ing personnel and the physical equipment of the colleges to assist in the training of our new armies This imposes great responsibilities on the colleges and at the same time creates an exceptional oppor tunity for service The colleges are asked to de vote the whole energy and educational power of the institution to the phases and lines of training de 288 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 20 1918 sired by the government The problem is a new one and calls for inventiveness and adaptability as well as that spirit of cooperation which the colleges have already so abundantly shown

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107603,ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS OF CHLORINE AND CARBON AND ON A NEW COMPOUND OF IODINE CARBON AND HYDROGEN,I206976, 47 VI ON TWO NEW COMPONDS F CHLORINE AND CARBO AND ON A NEW COMPOUND OF IODNE CARBON AND HYDROGEN BY MR FARADAY CHEMICAL SSISTANT IN THE ROYAL INSTITUTION COMMUNICATED BY WT BRANDE ESQ SEC R  AND PROF CHEM R I READ DECEMBER A1 T18O ONE OF THE FIRST CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDUCED SIR H DAVY TO DOUBT THE COMPOUND NATURE OF WHAT WAS FORMERLY CALLED OXYMURIATIC ACID GAS WAS THE WANT OF ACTION OF HEATED CHAR COAL UPON IT AND CONSIDERABLE USE OF THE SAME AGENT AND OF THE PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY IT IN DIFFERENT CRCUMSTANCES WITH CHLORINE WAS AFTERWARDS MADE IN ESTABLISHING THE SIMPLE NATURE OF THAT BODY THE TRUE NATURE OF CHLORINE BEING ASCERTAINED IT BECAME OF IMPORTANCE TO FORM ALL THE POSSIBLE COMPOUNDS OF IT WITH OTHER ELEMENTARY SUBSTANCES AND TO EXAMINE THEM IN THE NEW VIEW HAD OF THEIR NATURE THIS INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN PURSUED WITH SUCH SUCCESS AT DIFFERENT TIMES THAT VERY FEW ELEMENTS REMAIN UNCOMBINED WITH IT BUT WITH RESPECT TO CARBON THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH FIRST TENDED TO CORRECT THE ERRONEOUS OPINIONS WHICH AFTER SCHEELES TIME AND BEFORE THE YEAR 181O HAD GONE ABROAD RESPECTING ITS NATURE PROVED AN OBSTACLE TO THE FORMATION OF ITS COMPOUNDS AND UP TO THE PRESENT TIME THE CHLORIDES OF CARBON HAVE ESCAPED THE RE SEARCHES OF CHEMISTS THAT THE DIFFICULTY MET WITH IN FORMING A COMPOUND OF CHLORINE AND CARBON WAS PROBABLY NOT OWING TO ANY WANT ORMR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS WEAKNESS OF AFFINITY BETWEEN THE TWO BODIES WAS POINTED OUT BY SIR H DAVY  WHO REASONING ON THE TRIPLE COMPOUND OF CHLORINE CARBON AND HYDROGEN CONCLUDED THAT THE ATTRAC TION OF THE TWO BODIES FOR EACH OTHER WAS BY NO MEANS FEEBLE AND THE DISCOVERY OF PHOSGENE GAS BY DR DAVY IN WHICH CHLORINE AND CARBON ARE COMBINED WITH OXYGEN WAS ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE STRONGLY IN FAVOUR OF THIS OPINION I WAS INDUCED LAST SUMMER TO TAKE UP THIS SUBJECT AND HAVE BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO DISCOVER TWO CHLORIDES OF CARBON AND A COMPOUND OF IODINE CARBON AND HYDROGEN ANALOGOUS IN ITS NATURE TO THE TRIPLE COMPOUND OF CHLORINE CARBON AND HYDROGEN SOMETIMES CALLED CHLORIC ETHER I SHALL ENDEAVOUR IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES TO DESCRIBE THESE SUBSTANCES AND GIVE THE EXPERIMENTAL PROOFS OF THEIR NATURE IF CHLORINE AND OLEFIANT GAS BE MIXED TOGETHER IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT CONDENSATION TAKES PLACE AND A COLOURLESS LIMPID VOLATILE FLUID IS PRODUCED CONTAINING CHLORINE CARBON AND HYDROGEN IF THE VOLUMES OF THE TWO GASES ARE EQUAL THE CONDENSATION IS PERFECT IF THE OLEFIANT GAS IS IN EXCESS THAT EXCESS IS LEFT UNCHANGED BUT IF THE CHLORINE IS IN EXCESS THE FLUID BECOMES OF A YELLOW TINT AND ACID FUMES ARE PRODUCED THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ALONE PROVES THAT CHLORINE CAN TAKE HYDRO GEN FROM THE FLUID AND ON EXAMINATION I FOUND IT WAS WITH OUT THE LIBERATION OF ANY CARBON OR CHLORINE THAT THE ACTION THUS BEGAN MIGHT BE CARRIED TO ITS UTMOST EXTENT SOME OF THE PURE FLUID CHLORIC ETHER WAS PUT INTO A RETORT WITH CHLORINE AND EXPOSED TO SUNSHINE AT THE FIRST IN STANT OF CONTACT BETWEEN THE CHLORINE AND THE FLUID THE LATTER BECAME YELLOW BUT WHEN IN THE SUNS RAYS A FEW MOMENTS SUFFICED TO DESTROY THE COLOUR BOTH OF THE FLUID AND THE CHLORINE 48OF CHORINE AND CARBON IC HEAT BEING AT THE SAME TIME EVOLVED ON OPENING THE RETORT THERE WAS NO ABSORPTION BUT IT WAS FOUND FULL OF MURIATIC ACID GAS THIS WAS EXPELLED ID MORE CHLORINE INTRODUCED AND THE WHOLE AGAIN EXPOSED TO SUN LIGHT THE COLOUR AGAIN DISAPPEARED AND A FEW MOIST CRYSTALS WERE FORMED ROUND THE EDGE OF THE FLUID CHLORINE BEING A THIRD TIME INTRODUCED AND TREATED AS BEFORE IT STILL REMOVED MORE HYDROGEN AND NOW A SUBLIMATE OF CRYSTALS LINED THE RETORT PROCEEDING IN THIS WAY UNTIL THE CHLORINE EXERTED NO FARTHER ACTION THE FLUID ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED AND THE RESULTS WERE THE DRY CRYSTALLINE SUBSTANCE AND MURIATIC ACID GAS A PORTION OF OLEFIANT GAS WAS THEN MIXED IN A RETORT WITH EIGHT OR NINE TIMES ITS BULK OF CHLORINE AND EXPOSED TO SUN LIGHT AT FIRST THE FLUID FORMED BUT THIS INSTANTLY DISAP PEARED THE RETORT BECAME LINED WITH CRYSTALS AND THE COLOUR OF THE CHLORINE VERY MUCH DIMINISHED ON EXAMINING THESE CRYSTALS I FOUND THEY WERE THE COM POUND I WAS IN SEARCH OF BUT BEFORE I GIVE THE PROOFS OF THEIR NATURE I WILL DESCRIBE THE PROCESS BY WHICH THIS CHLORIDE OF CARBON CAN BE OBTAINED PURE PERCHLORIDE OF CARBON A GLASS VESSEL WAS MADE IN THE FORM OF AN ALEMBIC HEAD BUT WITHOUT THE BEAK  THE NECK WAS CONSIDERABLY CONTRACTED AND HAD A BRASS CAP WITH A STOPCOCK CEMENTED ON AT THE TOP WAS A SMALL APERTURE INTO WHICH A GROUND STOPPER FITTED AIR TIGHT THE CAPACITY OF THE VESSEL WAS ABOUT 2O CUBIC INCHES BEING EXHAUSTED BY THE AIRPUMP IT WAS NEARLY FILLED WITH CHLORINE AND BEING THEN PLACED OVER OLEFIANT GAS AND AS MUCH AS COULD ENTER HAVING PASSED IN THE STOPCOCKS MDGCCXXI H 49MR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS WERE SHUT AND THE WHOLE LEFT FOR A SHORT TIME WHEN THE FLUID COMPOUND OF CHLORINE AND OLEFIANT GAS HAD FORMED AND CONDENSED ON THE SIDES OF THE VESSEL IT WAS AGAINR PLACED OVER OLEFIANT GAS AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE CONDENSATION OF A LARGE PORTION OF THE GASES ACONSIDERABLE QUANTITY MORE ENTERED THIS WAS LEFT AS BEFORE TO COMBINE WITH PART OF THE REMAINING CHLORINE TO CONDENSE AND TO FORM A PARTIAL VACUUM WHICH WAS AGAIN FILLED WITH OLEFIANT GAS AND THE PROCESS REPEATED UNTIL ALL THE CHLORINE HAD UNITED TO FORM THE FLUID AND THE VESSEL REMAINED FULL OF OLEFIANT GAS CHLORINE WAS THEN AD MITTED IN REPEATED PORTIONS AS BEFORE CONSEQUENTLY MORE OF THE FLUID FORMED AND ULTIMATELY A LARGE PORTION WAS OBTAINED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL AND AN ATMOSPHERE OF CHLORINE ABOVE IT IT WAS NOW EXPOSED TO SUN LIGHT THE CHLORINE IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED AND THE VESSEL BECAME FILLED WITH MURIATIC ACID GAS HAVING ASCERTAINED THAT WATER DID NOT INTERFERE WITH THE ACTION OF THE SUBSTANCES A SMALL PORTION WAS ADMITTED INTO THE VESSEL WHICH ABSORBED THE MURIATIC ACID GAS AND THEN ANOTHER ATMOSPHERE OF CHLORINE WAS INTRODUCED AGAIN EXPOSED TO THE LIGHT THIS WAS PARTLY COMBINED WITH THE CARBON AND PARTLY CONVERTED INTO MURIATIC ACID GAS WHICH BEING AS BEFORE ABSORBED BY THE WATER LEFT SPACE FOR MORE CHLORINE REPEATING THIS ACTION THE FLUID GRADUALLY BECAME THICK AND OPAQUE FROM THE FORMATION OF CRYSTALS IN IT WHICH AT LAST ADHERED TO THE SIDES OF THE GLASS AS IT WAS TURNED ROUND AND ULTIMATELY THE VESSEL ONLY CONTAINED CHLO RINE WITH THE ACCUMULATED GASEOUS IMPURITIES OF THE SUCCESSIVE PORTIONS A STRONG SOLUTION OF MURIATIC ACID COLOURED BLUE FROM THE SOLUTION OF A LITTLE BRASS AND THE SOLID SUBSTANCE I HAVE FREQUENTLY CARRIED THE PROCESS THUS FAR IN RETORTS 50OF CHLORINE AND CARBON C 5S AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT ANY CONVENIENTLY FORMED GLASS VESSEL WILL ANSWER THE PURPOSE THE ADMISSION OF WATER DURING THE PROCESS PREVENTS THE NECESSITY OF REPEATED EXHAUSTION BY THE AIRPUMP WHICH CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT INJURY TO THE LATTER BUT TO HAVE THE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS PART OF THE PROCESS THE GASES SHOULD BE AS PURE AS POSSIBLE THAT NO ATMOSPHERE FOREIGN TO THE EXPERIMENT MAY COLLECT IN THE VESSEL IN ORDER TO CLEANSE THE SUBSTANCE THE REMAINING CHLORINE AND MURIATIC ACID WERE BLOWN OUT OF THE VESSEL BY A PAIR OF BELLOWS INTRODUCED AT THE STOPPERED APERTURE AND THE VESSEL AFTERWARDS FILLED WITH WATER TO WASH AWAY THE MURIATIC ACID AND OTHER SOLUBLE MATTERS CONSIDERABLE CARE IS THEN REQUISITE IN THE FARTHER PURIFICATION OF THE CHLORIDE IT RETAINS WATER MURIATIC ACID AND A SUBSTANCE WHICH I FIND TO BE A TRIPLE COMPOUND OF CHLORINE CARBON AND HYDROGEN FORMED FROM THE CEMENT OF THE CAP AND 1AS ALL THESE CONTAIN HYDROGEN A SMALL QUANTITY OF ANY ONE REMAINING WITH THE CHLORIDE WOULD IN ANALYSIS GIVE ERRONEOUS RESULTS VARIOUS METHODS OF PURI FICATION MAY BE DEVISED FOUNDED ON THE PROPERTIES OF THE SUB STANCE BUT I HAVE FOUND THE FOLLOWING THE MOST CONVENIENT THE SUBSTANCE IS TO BE WASHED FROM OFF THE GLASS AND POURED WITH THE WATER INTO A JAR A LITTLE ALCOHOL WILL REMOVE THE LAST PORTIONS WHICH ADHERE TO THE GLASS AND THIS WHEN POURED INTO THE WATER WILL PRECIPITATE THE CHLORIDE AND THE WHOLE WILL FALL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL THEN HAVING DECANTED THE WATER THE CHLORIDE IS TO BE COLLECTED ON A FILTER AND DRIED AS MUCH AS MAY BE BY PRESSURE BETWEEN FOLDS OF BIBULOUS PAPER IT SHOULD NEXT BE INTRODUCED INTO A GLASS TUBE AND SUBLIMED BY A SPIRIT LAMP THE PURE SUBSTANCE WITH WATER ILL RISE AT FIRST BUT THE LAST PORTIONS WILL BE PARTIALLY DECOMMR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS POSED MURIATIC ACID WILL BE LIBERATD AND CHARCOAL LEFT THE SUBLIMED PORTION IS THEN TO BE DISSOLVED IN ALCOHOL AND POURED INTO A WEAK SOLUTION OF POTASH BY WHICH THE SUBSTANCE IS THROWN DOWN AND THE MURIATIC ACID NEUTRALIZED AND SEPA RATED THEN WASH AWAY THE POTASH AND MURIATE BY REPEATED AFFUSION OF WATER UNTIL THE SUBSTANCE REMAINS PURE COLLECT IT ON A FILTER AND DRY IT FIRST BETWEEN FOLDS OF PAPER AND AFTERWARDS BY SULPHURIC ACID IN THE EXHAUSTED RECEIVER OF THE AIRPUMP IT WILL NOW APPEAR AS A WHITE PULVERULENT SUBSTANCE AND IF PERFECTLY PURE WILL NOT WHEN A LITTLE OF IT IS SUBLIMED IN A TUBE LEAVE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF CARBON OR LIBERATE ANY MU RIATIC ACID A SMALL PORTION OF IT DISSOLVED IN ETHER SHOULD GIVE NO PRECIPITATE WITH NITRATE OF SILVER IF IT BE NOT QUITE PURE IT MUST BE RESUBLIMED WASHED AND DRIED UNTIL IT IS PURE THIS SUBSTANCE DOES NOT REQUIRE THE DIRECT RAYS OF THE SUN FOR ITS FORMATION SEVERAL TUBES WERE FILLED WITH A MIXTURE OF ONE PART OF OLEFIANT GAS WITH FIVE OR SIX PARTS OF CHLORINE AND PLACED OVER WATER IN THE LIGHT OF A DULL DAY IN TWO OR THREE HOURS THERE WAS VERY CONSIDERABLE ABSORPTION AND CRYSTALS OF THE SUBSTANCE WERE DEPOSITED ON THE INSIDE OF THE TUBES I HAVE ALSO OFTEN OBSERVED THE FORMATION OF THE CRYSTALS IN RETORTS IN COMMON DAY LIGHT A RETORT BEING EXHAUSTED HAD I CUBIC INCHES OF OLEFIANT GAS INTRODUCED AND 475 CUBIC INCHES OF CHLORINE AS SOON AS THE CONDENSATION OCCASIONED BY THE FORMATION OF THE FLUID HAD TAKEN PLACE 215 CUBIC INCHES MORE OF CHLORINE WERE PASSED IN ANRD THE RETORT ET T ASIDE IN A DARK PLACE FOR TWO DAYS AT THE END OF THAT TIME MURIATIC ACID GAS AND THE SOLIDOF CHLORINE AND CARBON C 3 CHLORIDE HAD FORMED BUT THE GREATER PART OF THE FLUID IE MAINED UNCHANGED HENCE IT WILL FORM EVEN IN THE DARK BY LENGTH OF TIME I TRIED TO PRODUCE THE CHLORIDE BY EXPOSURE OF THE TWO GAES IN TUBES OVER WATER TO STRONG LAMP LIGLLT FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT COULD NOT SUCCEED THE PERCHLORIDE OF CARBON WHEN PURE IS IMMEDIATELY AFTER FUSION OR SUBLIMATION A TRANSPARENT COLOURLESS SUB STANCE IT HAS SCARCELY ANY TASTE ITS ODOUR IS AROMATIC AND APPROACHING TO THAT OF CAMPHOR ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS DS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE 2 ITS REFRACTIVE POWER IS HIGH BEING ABOVE THAT OF FLINT GLASS 15767 IT IS VERY FRIABLE EASILY BIREAKING DOWN UNDER PRESSURE AND WHEN SCRATCHED HAS MUCH OF THE FEEL AND APPEARANCE OF WHITE SUGAR IT DOES NOT CONDUCT ELECTRICITY THE CRYSTALS OBTAINED BY SUBLIMTATION AND FROM SOLUTIONS OF THE SUBSTANCE IN ALCOHOL AND ETHER ARE DENDIRITICAL PRISMATI OR IN PLATES THE VARIETIES OF FORM WHICH ARE VERY INTERESTING ARE EASILY ASCERTAINED AND RESULT FROM A PRIMITIVE OCTOEDRORI IT VOLATILIZES SLOWLY AT COMMON TEMPERATURES AND PASSES IN THE MANNER OF CAMPHOR TOWARDS THE LIGHT IF WARMED IT RISES MORE RAPIDLY AND THEN FORMS FINE CRYSTALS WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS FARTHER RAISED IT FUSES AT 320 F AND BOILS AT 60 UNDER ATMNBOSPHERIC PRESSURE WHEN CONDENSED AGAIN FROM THESE RAPID SUBLIMATIONS IT CONCRETES IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TUBE OR VESSEL CONTAINING IT IN SO TRANSPARENT AND COLOURLESS A STATE THAT IT IS DIFFICULT EXCEPT FROM ITS HIGH REFRACTIVE POWER TO PERCEIVE WHERE IT IS LODGED AS THE CRUST IT FORMS BECOMES THICKER IT SPLITS AND CRACKS LIKE SUBLIMED CAMPHOR AND IN A FEW MNINUTES AFTER IT IS COLD IS WHITE AND544 MR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS NEARLY OPAQUE IF THE HEAT BE RAISED STILL HIGHER AS WHEN THE SUBSTANCE IS PASSED THROUGH A RED HOT TUBE IT IS DECOM POSED CHLORINE IS EVOLVED AND ANOTHER CHLORIDE OF CARBON WHICH CONDENSES INTO A FLUID IS OBTAINED THIS SHALL BE DESCRIBED PRESENTLY IT IS NOT READILY COMBUSTIBLE WHEN HELD IN THE FLAME OF A SPIRIT LAMP IT BURNS WITH A RED FLAME EMITTING MUCH SMOKE AND ACID FUMES BUT WHEN REMOVED FROM THE LAMP COM BUSTION CEASES IN THE COMBUSTION THAT DOES TAKE PLACE IN THE LAMP THE HYDROGEN OF THE ALCOHOL BY COMBINING WITH THE CHLORINE OF THE COMPOUND PERFORMS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE SUBSTANCE IS HEATED RED IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF PURE OXYGEN IT SOMETIMES BURNS WITH A BRIL LIANT LIGHT IT IS NOT SOLUBLE IN WATER AT COMMON TEMPERATURES OR ONLY IN VERY SMALL QUANTITY WHEN A DROP OR TWO OF THE ALCOHOLIC SOLUTION IS POURED INTO A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER IT RENDERS IT TURBID FROM THE DEPOSITION OF THE SUBSTANCE IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT HOT WATER DISSOLVES MORE OF IT THAN COLD WATER IT DISSOLVES IN ALCOHOL WITH FACILITY AND IN MUCH GREATER QUANTITY WITH HEAT THAN WITHOUT A SATURATED HOT SOLUTION CRYSTALLIZES AS IT COOLS AND THE COLD SOLUTION ALSO GIVES CRYS TALS BY SPONTANEOUS EVAPORATION WHEN POURED INTO WATER THE CHLORIDE IS PRECIPITATED AND FALLS TO THE BOTTOM IN FLAKES IF BURNT THE FLAME OF THE ALCOHOL IS BRIGHTENED BY THE PRE SENCE OF THE SUBSTANCE AND FUMES OF MURIATIC ACID ARE LIBE RATED SOLUTION OF NITRATE OF SILVER DOES NOT PRODUCE ANY TUR BIDNESS IN IT UNLESS IT BE IN SUCH QUANTITY THAT THE WATER THROWS DOWN THE SUBSTANCE BUT NO CHLORIDE OF SILVER IS FORMED IT IS MUCH MORE SOLUBLE IN ETHER THAN IN ALCOHOL AND MOREOF CHLORINE AND CARBON C 5 SO IN HOT THAN IN COLD ETHER THE HOT SOLUTION DEPOSITS CRYSTALS AS IT COOLS AND THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF A COLD SOLUTION WHEN EVAPORATED ON A GLASS PLATE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL THIS SOLUTION IS NOT PRECIPITATED BY WATER UNLESS THE ETHER HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN DRIED AND THEN WATER OCCASIONS A TURBIDNESS NITRATE OF SILVER DOES NOT PRECIPITATE IT WHEN BURNED MURIATIC ACID FUMES ARE LIBERATED BUT THE GREATER PART OF THE CHLORIDE REMAINS IN THE CAPSULE IT IS SOLUBLE IN THE VOLATILE OILS AND ON EVAPORATION IS AGAIN OBTAINED IN CRYSTALS IT IS ALSO READILY SOLUBLE IN FIXED OILS THE SOLUTIONS WHEN HEATED LIBERATE MURIATIC ACID GAS AND THE OIL BECOMES OF A DARK COLOUR AS IF CHARRED SOLUTIONS OF THE ACIDS AND ALKALIES DO NOT ACT WITH ANLY ENERGY ON THE SUBSTANCE WHEN BOILED WITH SOLUTIONS OF PURE POTASH AND SODA IT RISES AND CONDENSES IN THE UPPER PART OF THE VESSEL AND THOUGH IT BE BROUGHT DOWN TO THE ALKALI MANY TIMES AND REBOILED STILL THE ALKALI WHEN EX AMINED IS NOT FOUND TO CONTAIN ANY CHLORINE NOR IS ANY CHANGE PRODUCED AMMONIA IN SOLUTION IS ALSO WITHOUT ACTION UPON IT THESE SOLUTIONS DO NOT APPEAR TO DISSOLVE MORE OF IT THAN PURE WATER MURIATIC ACID IN SOLUTION DOES NOT ACT AT ALL UPON IT STRONG NITRIC ACID BOILED UPON IT DISSOLVES A PORTION BUT DOES NOT DECOMPOSE IT AS IT COOLS PART OF THE CHLORIDE IS DEPOSITED UNALTERED AND THE CONCENTRATED ACID WHEN DILUTED LETS MORE FALL DOWN THE DILUTED PORTION BEING FILTERED AND TESTED WITH NITRATE OF SILVER GIVES NO PRECIPITATE IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE EITHER SOLUBLE IN OR ACTED UPON BY CONCENTRATED SUL PHURIC ACID IT SINKS SLOWLY IN THE ACID AND WHEN HEATED5S6 2MR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS IS CONVERTED INTO VAPOUR WHICH RISING THROUGH THE ACID CONDENSES IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TUBE IT IS NOT ACTED UPON BY OXYGEN AT TEMPERATURES UNDER A RED HEAT A MIXTURE OF OXYGEN AND THE VAPOUR OF THE SUBSTANCE WOULD NOT INFLAME BY A STRONG ELECTRIC SPARK THOUGH THE TEMPERATURE WAS RAISED BY A SPIRITLAMP TO ABOUT 400 WHEN OXYGEN MIXED WITH THE VAPOUR OF THE SUBSTANCE IS PASSED THROUGH A REDHOT TUBE THERE IS DECOMPOSITION AND MIXTURES OF CHLORINE CARBONIC OXIDE CARBONIC ACID ARD POSGENE GASES ARE PRODUCED A PORTION OF THE CHLORIDE WAS HEATED WITH PER OXIDE OF MERCURY IN A GLASS TUBE OVER MERCURY AS SOON AS THE OXIDE HAD GIVEN OFF OXYGEN AND THE HEAT HAD RISEN SO HIGH AS TO SOFTEN THE GLASS CONSIDERABLY THE VAPOUR SUDDENLY DETONATED WITH THE OXYGEN WITH BRIGHT INFLAMMATION THE SUBSTANCES REMAINING WERE OXYGEN CARBONIC ACID AND CALO MEL AND I BELIEVE THERE WAS NO DECOMPOSITION OR ACTION UNTIL SO MUCH MERCURY HAD RISEN IN VAPOUR AS TO AID THE OXYGEN BY A KIND OF DOUBLE AFFINITY IN DECOMPOSING THE CHLORIDE OF CARBON CHLORINE PRODUCES NO CHANGE ON THE SUBSTANCE EITHER BY EXPOSURE TO LIGHT OR HEAT WHEN IODINE IS HEATED WITH IT AT LOW TEMPERATURES THE TWO SUBSTANCES MELT AND UNITE AND THERE IS NO FARTHER ACTION WHEN HEATED MORE STRONGLY IN VAPOUR THE IODINE SEPARATES CHLORINE REDUCING THE PERCHLORIDE TO THE FLUID PROTOCHLORIDE OF CARBON AND CHLORIODINE IS PRODUCED THIS DISSOLVES AND IF NO EXCESS OF IODINE BE PRESENT THE WHOLE REMAINS FLUID AT COMMON TEMPERATURES WHEN WATER IS ADDED IT GENERALLY LIBERATES A LITTLE IODINE AND ON HEATING THE SOLUTION SO AS TOOF CHLORINE AND CARBON C DRIVE OFF ALL FREE IODINE AND TESTING BY NITRATE OF SILVER CHLO RIDE AND IODIDE OF SILVER ARE OBTAINED HYDROGEN AND THE VAPOUR OF THE SUBSTANCE WOULD NOT IN FLAME AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 4O00 F BY STRONG ELECTRICAL SPARKS BUT WHEN THE MIXTURE WAS SENT THROUGH A RED HOT TUBE THE CHLORIDE WAS DECOMPOSED AND MURIATIC ACID GAS AND CHARCOAL PRODUCED THE VAPOUR OF THE PERCHLORIDE OF CARBON READILY DETONATES BG THE ELECTRIC SPARK WITH A MIXTURE OF OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN GASES BUT THE GASEOUS RESULTS ARE VERY MIXED AND UNCER TAIN FROM THE NEAR EQUIPOISE OF AFFINITIES THAT EXIST AMONG THE ELEMENTS SULPHUR READILY UNITES TO IT WHEN MELTED WITH IT AND THE MIXTURE CRYSTALLIZES ON COOLING INTO A YELLOWISH MASS WHEN HEATED MORE STRONGLY THE SUBSTANCE RISES UNCHANGED AND LEAVES THE SULPHUR UNALTERED BUT WHEN THE MIXED VAPOURS ARE RAISED TO A STILL HIGHER TEMPERATURE CHLORIDE OF SULPHUR AND PROTOCHLORIDE OF CARBON ARE FORMED SOMETIMES THERE ARE APPEARANCES AS IF A CARBURET OF SULPHUR WERE FORMED BUT OF THIS I HAVE NOT SATISFIED MYSELF PHOSPHORUS AT LOW TEMPERATURES MELTS AND UNITES WITH THE SUBSTANCE WITHOUT ANY DECOMPOSITION IF HEATED IN THE VAPOUR OF THE SUBSTANCE BUT NOT TOO HIGHLY IT TAKES AWAY CHLORINE AND FORMS THE PROTOCHLORIDES OF PHOSPHORUS AND CARBON IF HEATED MORE HIGHLY IT FREQUENTLY INFLAMES IN THE VAPOUR WITH A BRILLIANT COMBUSTION AND ABUNDANCE OF CHAR COAL IS DEPOSITED SOMETIMES I HAVE HAD THE CHARCOAL LEFT IN FILMS STRETCHING ACROSS THE TUBES AND OCCUPYING THE SPACE WHERE THE FLAME PASSED THE APPEARANCE IS THEN VERY BEAUTIFUL MDCCCXXI I S7MR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS WHEN PHOSPHORUS IS HEATED WITH THE VAPOUR OF THE SUB STANCE OVER MERCURY SO AS NOT TO INFLAME IN IT THERE IS GENE RALLY A SMALL PORTION OF MURIATIC ACID GAS FORMED IF GREAT CARE BE TAKEN THIS IS IN VERY MINUTE QUANTITY  AND ITS VARIABLE PROPORTION SUFFICIENTLY SHOWS THAT THE HYDROGEN WHICH FORMS IT DOES NOT COME FROM THE SUBSTANCE I AM INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS DERIVED FROM MOISTURE ADHERING TO THE PHOSPHORUS THE ACTION OF IODINE ON PHOSPHORUS SHOWS THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRY THE LATTER SUBSTANCE PERFECTLY A STICK OF PHOSPHORUS PUT INTO THE ALCOHOLIC OR ETHERIAL SOLUTION OF THE PERCHLORIDE DID NOT EXERT ANY ACTION UPON IT CHARCOAL HEATED IN THE VAPOUR OF THE SUBSTANCE APPEARS TO HAVE NO ACTION UPON IT MOST OF THE METALS DECOMPOSE IT AT HIGH TEMPERATURES POTASSIUM BURNS BRILLIANTLY IN THE VAPOUR DEPOSITING CHARCOAL AND FORMING CHLORIDE OF POTASSIUM IRON ZINC TIN COPPER AND MERCURY ACT ON IT AT A RED HEAT FORMING CHLORIDES OF THOSE METALS AND DEPOSITING CHARCOAL AND WHEN THE EXPERIMENTS ARE MADE WITH PURE SUBSTANCES AND VERY CAREFULLY NO OTHER RESULTS ARE OBTAINED SOME OF THE SUBSTANCE WAS PASSED OVER IRON TURNINGS HEATED IN A GLASS TUBE AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SUBLIMATION OF THE CHLORIDE THROUGH THE HOT IRON THE COMMON AIR OF THE VESSELS WAS EXPELLED AND RECEIVED IN DIFFERENT TUBES BUT BEFORE ONETHIRD OF THE SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN PASSED ALL LIBERATION OF GAS CEASED AND THE REMAINDER WAS DECOMPOSED BY THE IRON WITHOUT THE PRODUCTION OF ANY GASEOUS MATTERS THE DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF AIR THAT WERE THROWN OUT BEING EXAMINED THE FIRST PROVED TO BE COMMON AIR AND THE LAST CARBONIC OXIDE THIS HAD RESULTED PROBABLY FROM THE ACTION OF THE CHLORINE ON THE LEAD OF THE GLASS TUBE 58OF CHLORINE AND CARBON C AN EVIDENT ACTION HAD TAKEN PLACE AND THE OXYGEN EVOLVED MEETING WITLL THE LIBERATED CARBON WOULD PRODUCE THE CAR BONIC OXIDE THIS EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES WITH THE SAME RESULTS WHEN THE PERCHLORIDE OF CARBON IS HEATED WITH METALLIC OXIDES DIFFERENT RESULTS ARE PRODUCED ACCORDING TO THE PROPOR TIONS OF OXYGEN IN THE OXIDES THE PEROXIDES AS OF MERCURY COPPER LEAD AND TIN PRODUCE CHLORIDES OF THOSE METALS AND CARBONIC ACID AND THE PROTOXIDES AS THOSE OF ZINC LEAD C PRODUCE ALSO CHLORIDES BUT THE GASEOUS PRODUCTS ARE MIXTURES OF CARBONIC ACID AND CARBONIC OXIDE I HAVE FRE QUENTLY PERCEIVED THE SMELL OF PHOSGENE GAS ON PASSING THE CHLORIDE OVER OXIDE OF ZINC  AND AS THE SUBSTANCE EASILY LIBE RATES CHLORINE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES IT WILL BE READILY SEEN HOW A SMALL PORTION OF THAT GAS MAY BE FORMED IT ALSO HAPPENS SOMETIMES THAT THE PROTOXIDES BECOME BLACKENED FROM THE DEPOSITION OF CHARCOAL WHEN THE VAPOUR OF THE CHLORIDE IS PASSED OVER LIME BARYTA OR STRONTIA HEATED RED HOT A VERY VIVID COMBUSTION IS PRODUCED THE OXYGEN AND THE CHLORINE CHANGE PLACES AND BOTH THE METALS AND THE CARBON ARE BURNT CHLORIDES ARE PRODUCED CARBONIC ACID IS FORMED AND ABSORBED BY TLHE UNDE COMPOSED PARTS OF THE EARTHS AND CARBON IS DEPOSITED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS NO CARBONIC OXIDE IS PRODUCED WHEN PASSED OVER MAGNESIA THERE IS NO ACTION ON THE EARTH BUT THE PERCHLORIDE OF CARBON IS CONVERTED BY THE HEAT INTO PROTO CHLORIDE IN THESE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE OXIDES NO TRACE OF WATER COULD BE PERCEIVED HAVING THUS FAR DESCRIBED THE PROPERTIES OF THE SUBSTANCE 596O MR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS I SHALL NOW GIVE THE REASONS WHICH INDUCE ME TO COTNSIDER IT A TRUE CHLORIDE OF CARBON AND SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO ASSIGN ITS COMPOSITION MY FIRST OBJECT WAS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER HY DROGEN EXISTED IN IT OR NOT WHEN PHOSPHORUS IS HEATED IN IT A SMALL QUANTITY OF MURIATIC ACID IS GENERALLY FORMED BUT DOUBT ARISES AS TO THE CAUSE OF ITS PRODUCTION FROM THE CIR CUMSTANCE THAT THE PHOSPHORUS AS ALREADY MENTIONED MAY BE THE SOURCE OF THE HYDROGEN WHEN POTASSIUM IS HEATED IN THE VAPOUR OF THE SUBSTANCE THERE IS GENERALLY A SMALL EX PANSION OF VOLUME AND INFLAMMABLE GAS PRODUCED BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CLEANSE POTASSIUM BOTH FROM NAPTHA AND AN ADHERING CRUST OF MOIST POTASH AND EITHER OF THESE THOUGH IN EXTREMELY MINUTE QUANTITIES WOULD GIVE FALLACIOUS RESULTS A MORE UNEXCEPTIONABLE EXPERIMENT MADE WITH IRON HAS BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED AND THE INFERENCES FROM IT ARE AGAINST THE PRESENCE OF HYDROGEN IN THE COMPOUND SOME OF THE SUBSTANCE IN VAPOUR WAS ELECTRIZED OVER MERCURY BY HAVING MANY HUNDRED SPARKS PASSED THROUGH IT CALOMEL WAS FORMED AND CARBON DEPOSITED A VERY MINUTE BUBBLE OF GAS WAS PRODUCED BUT IT WAS MUCH TOO SMALL TO INTERFERE WITH THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN RESPECTING THE BINARY NATURE OF THE COMPOUND AND WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY AIR THAT HAD ADHERED TO THE SIDES OF THE TUBE WHEN THE MERCURY WAS POURED IN THE MOST PERFECT DEMONSTRATION THAT THE BODY CONTAINS NO HYDROGEN AND INDEED OF ITS NATURE ALTOGETHER IS OBTAINED FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTEND ITS FORMATION WHEN THE FLUID COMPOUND OF CHLORINE AND OLEFIANT GAS IS ACTED ON BY CHLORINE AND SOLAR LIGHT IN CLOSE VESSELS ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE OF THE CHLORINE DISAPPEARS YET THERE IS NO CHANGE OFOF CHLORINE AND CARBON C 61 VOLUME ITS PLACE BEING OCCUPIED BY MURIATIC ACID GAS HENCE AS MURIATIC ACID GAS IS KNOWN TO CONSIST OF EQUAL VOLUMES OF CHLORINE AND HYDROGEN COMBINED WITHOUT CONDENSATION IT IS EVIDENT THAT HALF THE CHLORINE INTRODUCED INTO THE VESSEL HAS COMBINED WITH THE ELEMENTS OF THE FLUID AND LIBERATED AN EQUAL VOLUME OF HYDROGEN AND AS WHEN THE CHLORIDE IS PERFECTLY FORMEDIT CONDENSES NO MURIATIC ACID GAS A METHOD APPARENTLY FREE FROM ALL FALLACY IS THUS AFFORDED OF ASCERTAINING ITS NATURE I HAVE MADE MANY EXPERIMENTS ON GIVEN VOLUMES OF CHLORINE AND OLEFIANT GASES A CLEAN DRY RETORT WAS FITTED WITH A CAP AND STOPCOCK ITS CAPACITY WAS G255 CUBIC INCHES BEING EXHAUSTED BY THE AIRPUMP IT WAS FILLED WITH NITROGEN 2425 CUBIC INCHES BEING REQUIRED AND BEING AGAIN EXHAUSTED 5 CUBIC INCHES OF OLEFIANT GAS AND LO CUBIC INCHES OF CHLORINE WERE INTRODUCED IT WAS THEN SET ASIDE FOR HALF AN HOUR THAT THE FLUID COMPOUND MIGHT FORM AND AFTERWARDS BEING PLACED AGAIN OVER A JAR OF CHLORINE 1925 CUBIC INCHES ENTERED SO THAT THE CONDENSATION HAD BEEN AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE 1O CUBIC INCHES OR TWICE THE VO LUME OF THE OLEFIANT GAS BAROMETER 291 INCHES IT WAS NOW PLACED FOR THE DAY OCTOBER 18TH IN THE RAYS OF THE SUN  BUT THE WEATHER WAS NOT VERY FINE IN THE EVENING THE SOLID CRYSTALLINE SUBSTANCE HAD FORMED IN ABUNDANCE AND VERY LITTLE FLUID REMAINED WHEN PLACED OVER CHLORINE NOT THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IN VOLUME HAD BEEN PRODUCED THE STOP COCK WAS NOW OPENED UNDER MERCURY AND A SMALL PORTION OF THE METAL HAVING ENTERED IT WAS AGITATED IN THE RETORT TO ABSORB THE CHLORINE THE INECK OF THE RETORT WAS LEFT OPEN UNDER THE MERCURY ALL NIGHT AND THE WHOLE AGITATED FROM TIME TO TIME NEXT MORNING BAROMETER 296 THE MERCURY6N MR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS WHICH HAD ENTERED BEING PASSED INTO THE NECK OF THE RETORT STOOD AT A CERTAIN MARK 6 INCHES ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE MER CURY IN THE TROUGH OCCUPYING I25 CUBIC INCHES AND LEAVING 24 CUBIC INCHES FILLED BY THE EXPANDED MURIATIC ACID GAS AND NITROGEN THESE VOLUMES CORRECTED TO THE PRESSURE OF 291 INCHES GIVE 578 CUBIC INCHES FOR THE CHLORINE ABSORBED AND 1947 CUBIC INCHES FOR THE MURIATIC ACID GAS C THESE AB SORBED BY WATER LEFT IS CUBIC INCHES OF NITROGEN  SO THAT THE GASES IN THE RETORT AFTER THE ACTION OF SOLAR LIGHT WERE MURIATIC ACID GAS 1827 CUBIC INCHES CHLORINE  578 NITROGEN C  1 AND BEFORE THAT ACTION CHLORINE  2925 CUBIC INCHES OLEFIANT GAS 5 NITROGEN    HENCE 2347 CUBIC INCHES OF CHLORINE HAD DISAPPEARED AND 91G OF THESE HAD ENTERED INTO COMBINATION WITH AN EQUAL VOLUME OF 913 CUBIC INCHES OF HYDROGEN LIBERATED FROM THE 5 CUBIC INCHES OF OLEFIANT GAS TO FORM MURIATIC ACID AND CONSEQUENTLY 1434 CUBIC INCHES OF CHLORINE REMAINED COM BINED WITH THE CARBON OF THE 5 CUBIC INCHES OF OLEFIANT GAS HERE THE VOLUME OF CHLORINE ACTUALLY EMPLOYED IS NOT QUITE FIVE TIMES THAT OF THE OLEFIANT GAS NOR THE VOLUME OF MURIATIC ACID GAS PRODUCED EQUAL TO FOUR TIMES THAT OF THE OLEFIANT GAS BUT THEY APPROXIMATE AND WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THAT THE CONVERSION WAS NOT QUITE PERFECT AND THAT THE GASES USED WOULD INEVITABLY CONTAIN A SLIGHT PORTION OF IMPURITY THE CAUSES OF THE DEFICIENCY CAN EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD IN OTHER EXPERIMENTS MADE IN THE SAME WAY BUT WITHOF CHLORINE AND CARBON C SMALLER QUANTITIES MORE ACCURATE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED CUBIC INCH OF OLEFIANT GAS WITH 125 CUBIC INCHES OF CHLORINE PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF LIGHT 367 CUBIC INCHES OF MURIATIC ACID GAS 4 963 OF THE CHLORINE HAVING BEEN USED 14 CUBIC INCH OF OLEFIANT GAS WITH 125 CUBIC INCHES OF CHLORINE PRO DUCED 5O6 CUBIC INCHES OF MURIATIC ACID GAS 67 CUBIC INCHES OF CHLORINE HAVING BEEN USED OTHER EXPERIMENTS GAVE VERY NEARLY THE SAME RESULTS AND I HAVE DEDUCED FROM THEM THAT 1 VOLUME OF OLEFIANT GAS REQUIRES 5 VOLUMES OF CHLORINE FOR ITS CONVERSION INTO MURIATIC ACID AND CHLORIDE OF CARBON THAT 4 V VOLUMES OF MURIATIC ACID GAS ARE FORMED THAT 3 VOLUMES OF CHLORINE COMBINE WITH THE 2 VOLUMES OF CARBON IN THE OLEFIANT GAS TO FORM THE SOLID CRYSTALLINE CHLORIDE AND THAT WHEN CHLORINE ACTS ON THE FLUID COMPOUND OF CHLORINE AND OLEFIANT GAS FOR EVERY VOLUME OF CHLORINE THAT COMBINES AN EQUAL VOLUME OF HYDROGEN IS SEPARATED I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO VERIFY THESE PROPORTIONS BY ANALYTICAL EXPERIMENTS THE MODE I ADOPTED WAS TO SEND THE SUBSTANCE IN VAPOUR OVER METALS AND METALLIC OXIDES AT HIGH TEMPERA TURES CONSIDERABLE CARE IS REQUISITE IN SUCH EXPERIMENTS FOR IF THE PROCESS BE CARRIED ON QUICKLY A PORTION OF FLUID CHLORIDE OF CARBON IS FORMED AND ESCAPES DECOMPOSITION THE FOLLOWING ARE TWO RESULTS FROM A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS AGREEING WELL WITH EACH OTHER 5 GRAINS WERE PASSED OVER PEROXIDE OF COPPER IN AN IRON TUBE AND THE GAS COLLECTED OVER MERCURY IT AMOUNTED TO 39 CUBIC INCHES BAROMETER 2985 THERMOMETER 4 F OF THESE NEARLY 38 CUBIC INCHES WERE CARBONIC ACID AND RATHER MORE THAN 1 OF A CUBIC INCH WAS CARBONIC OXIDE THESE ARE NEARLY EQUAL TO 5004 OF A GRAIN OF CARBON HENCE IOO 65MR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS OF THE CHLORIDE WOULD GIVE 10 OF CARBON NEARLY BUT BY CAL CULATION ICO SHOULD GIVE 1019 THE DIFFERENCE IS SO SMALL AS TO COME WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ERRORS IN EXPERIMENT 5 GRAINS WERE PASSED OVER PEROXIDE OF COPPER IN A TUBE MADE OF GREEN PHIAL GLASS AND THE CHLORINE ESTIMATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS BEFORE 177 GRAINS OF CHLORIDE OF SILVER WERE OBTAINED EQUAL TO 436 GRAINS OF CHLORINE THIS RESULT APPROACHES MUCH NEARER TO THE CALCULATED RESULT THAN THE FORMER BUT THERE HAD STILL BEEN ACTION ON THE TUBE AND A MINUTE PORTION OF THE SUBSTANCE HAD PASSED UNDECOMPOSED AND CONDENSED AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TUBE IN CRYSTALS EXPERIMENTS MADE BY PASSING THE PERCHLORIDE OVER HOT LIME OR BARYTES PROMISE TO BE MORE ACCURATE AND EASY OF PERFORMANCE IN THE MEAN TIME THE ABOVE ANALYTICAL RESULTS WILL PERHAPS BE CONSIDERED AS STRONG CORROBORATION OF THE OPINION OF THE NATURE OF THE COMPOUND DEDUCED FROM THE SYNTHETICAL EXPERIMENTS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE PER CHLORIDE OF CARBON WILL BE 3 PROPORTIONS OF CHLORINE  1005 2 DITTO CARBON  114 1119 PROTOCHLORIDE OF CARBON HAVING SAID SO MUCH ON THE NATURE OF THE PERCHLORIDE OF CARBON I SHALL HAVE LESS OCCASION TO DWELL ON THE PROOFS THAT THE COMPOUND I AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE IS ALSO A BINARY COMBI NATION OF CARBON AND CHLORINE WHEN THE VAPOUR OF THE PERCHLORIDE OF CARBON IS HEATED TO DULL REDNESS CHLORINE IS LIBERATED AND A NEW COMPOUND OF THAT ELEMENT AND CARBON IS PRODUCED THIS IS READILY SHOWN 64OF CHLORINE AND CARBON C BY HEATING THE BOTTOM OF A SMALL GLASS TUBE CONTAINING SOME OF THE PERCHLORIDE IN A SPIRIT LAMP THE SUBSTANCE AT FIRST SUBLIMES BUT AS THE VAPOUR BECOMES HEATED BELOW IT IS GRA DUALLY CONVERTED INTO PROTOCHLORIDE AND CHLORINE IS EVOLVED IT IS NOT WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE PRECAUTION THAT THE PROTO CHLORIDE OF CARBON CAN BE OBTAINED PURE FOR THOUGH PASSED THROUGH A GREAT LENGTH OF HEATED TUBE PART OF THE PERCHLO RIDE FREQUENTLY ESCAPES DECOMPOSITION THE PROCESS I HAVE ADOPTED IS THE FOLLOWING SOME OF THE PERCHLORIDE IS INTRO DUCED INTO THE CLOSED END OF A TUBE AND THE SPACE ABOVE IT FOR TEN OR TWELVE INCHES FILLED WITH SMALL FRAGMENTS OF ROCK CRYSTAL THE PART OF THE TUBE BEYOND THIS IS THEN BENT UP AND DOWN TWO OR THREE TIMES SO THAT THE ANGLES MAY FORM RE CEIVERS FOR THE NEW COMPOUND THEN HEATING THE TUBE AND CRYSTAL TO BRIGHT REDNESS AND DIPPING THE ANGLES IN WATER THE PERCHLORIDE IS SLOWLY SUBLIMED BY A SPIRIT LAMP AND ON PASSING INTO THE HOT PART OF THE TUBE IS DECOMPOSED  A FLUID PASSES OVER WHICH IS CONDENSED IN THE ANGLES OF THE TUBE AND CHLORINE ISMEVOLVED PART OF THE GAS ESCAPES BUT THE GREATER PORTION IS RETAINED IN SOLUTION BY THE FLUID AND RENDERS IT YELLOW HAVING PROCEEDED THUS FAR BY THE CAREFUL AP PLICATION OF A LAMP AND BLOWPIPE THE BENT PART OF THE TUBE MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THAT WITHIN THE FIRNACE AND THE END CLOSED SO AS TO FORM A SMALL RETORT AND ON DISTILLING THE FLUID FOUR OR FIVE TIMES FROM ONE ANGLE TO THE OTHER ALL THE CHLORINE MAY BE DRIVEN OFF WITHOUT ANY LOSS OF THE SUB STANCE AND IT BECOMES LIMPID AND COLOURLESS IT STILL HOW EVER ALWAYS CONTAINS SOME PERCHLORIDE WHICH HAS ESCAPED DECOMPOSITION AND TO SEPARATE THIS I HAVE BOILED THE FLUID UNTIL THE TUBE WAS NEARLY FULL OF ITS VAPOUR AND THEN CLOSING MDCCCXXI K 6566 MR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS THE END THAT STILL REMAINED OPEN BY A LAMP AND BLOWPIPE HAVE AFTERWARDS LEFT THE WHOLE TO COOL IT IS THEN EASY BY COLLECTING ALL THE FLUID INTO ONE END OF THE TUBE AND INTRODUC ING THAT END THROUGH A CORK INTO A RECEIVER UNDER WHICH A VERY SMALL FLAME IS BURNING TO DISTIL THE WHOLE OF THE FLUID AT A TEMPERATURE VERY LITTLE ABOVE THAT OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE SOLID CHLORIDE BEING LESS VOLATILE DOES NOT RISE SO SOON AND THE PURE PROTOCHLORIDE COLLECTS AT THE EXTERNAL END OF THE TUBE TO ASCERTAIN ITS PURITY A DROP MAY BE PLACED ON A GLASS PLATE IT WILL IMMEDIATELY EVAPORATE AND IF IT CONTAINS PERCHLORIDE THAT SUBSTANCE WILL BE LEFT BEHIND OTHERWISE NO TRACE WILL REMAIN ON THE GLASS THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF FREE CHLORINE MAY BE ASCERTAINED BY DISSOLVING A LITTLE OF THE FLUID IN ALCOHOL OR ETHER AND TESTING BY NITRATE OF SILVER THE PURE PROTOCHLORIDE OF CARBON IS A HIGHLY LIMPID FLUID AND PERFECTLY COLOURLESS ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS 15526 IT IS A NONL ONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY I AM INDEBTED TO DR WOLLAS TON FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE REFRACTIVE POWER OF THIS CHLO RIDE AND FOR THE APPROXIMATION TO THE REFRACTIVE POWER GIVEN OF THE PERCHLORIDE IN THE PRESENT CASE IT IS 14875 BEING VERY NEARLY THAT OF CAMPHOR IT IS NOT COMBUSTIBLE EXCEPT WHEN HELD IN A FLAME AS OF A SPIRIT LAMP AND THEN IT BURNS WITH A BRIGHT YELLOW LIGHT MUCH SMOKE AND FUMES OF MURIATIC ACID IT DOES NOT BECOME SOLID AT THE ZERO OF FAHRENHEITS SCALE WHEN ITS TEMPERATURE IS RAISED UNDER THE SURFACE OF WATER TO BETWEEN 16O AND 17O IT IS CONVERTED INTO VAPOUR AND RE MAINS IN THAT STATE UNTIL THE TEMPERATURE IS LOWERED WHEN HEATED MORE HIGHLY AS BY BEING PASSED OVER RED HOT ROCK CRYSTAL IN A GLASS TUBE A SMALL PORTION IS ALWAYS DECOMPOSED NEARLY ALL THE FLUID MAY HOWEVER BE CONDENSED AGAIN BUTOF CHLORINE AND CARBON C IT PASSES SLIGHTLY COLOURED AND THE TUBE AND CRYSTAL ARE BLACKENED ON THE SURFACE BY CHARCOAL I AM UNCERTAIN WHE THER THIS DECOMPOSITION OUGHT NOT TO BE ATTRIBUTED RATHER TO THE ACTION OF THE GLASS AT THIS HIGH TEMPERATURE THAN TO THE HEAT ALONE IT IS NOT SOLUBLE IN WATER BUT REMAINS AT THE BOTTOM OF ILT IN DROPS FOR MANY WEEKS WITHOUT ANY ACTION IT IS SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL AND ETHER AND THE SOLUTIONS BURN WITH A GREENISH FLAME EVOLVING FUMES OF MURIATIC ACID IT IS SOLUBLE IN THE VOLATILE AND FIXED OILS THE VOLATILE OILS CONTAINING IT BURN WITH THE EMISSION OF FUMES OF MURIATIC ACID WHEN THE SOLUTIONS OF IT IN THE FIXED OILS ARE HEATED THEY DO NOT BLACKEN OR EVOLVE FUMES OF MURIATIC ACID IT IS THEREFORE PROBABLE THAT WHEN THIS HAPPENS WITH THE SOLUTION OF THE PERCHLORIDE IN FIXED OILS IT IS FROM ITS CONVERSION BY THE HEAT INTO PROTOCHLORIDE AND THE LIBERATION OF CHLORINE IT IS NOT SOLUBLE IN ALKALINE SOLUTIONS NOR DO THEY ACT ON0 IT IN SOME DAYS NEITHER IS IT AT ALL SOLUBLE IN OR AFFECTED BY STRONG NITRIC MURIATIC OR SULPHURIC ACIDS SOLUTIONS OF SILVER DO NOT ACT ON IT OXYGEN DECOMPOSES IT AT HIGH TEMPERATURES FORMING CAR BONIC OXIDE OR ACID AND LIBERATING CHLORINE CHLORINE DISSOLVES IN IT IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY BUT HAS NO FARTHER ACTION OR ONLY A VERY SLOW ONE IN COMMON DAY LIGHT ON EXPOSURE TO SOLAR LIGHT A DIFFERENT RESULT TAKES PLACE I HAVE ONLY HAD TWO DAYS AND THOSE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOVEM BER ON WHICH I COULD EXPOSE THE PROTOCHLORIDE OF CARBON IN ATMOSPHERES OF CHLORINE TO SOLAR LIGHT AND HENCE THE CON VERSION OF THE WHOLE OF THE PROTOCHLORIDE WAS NOT PERFECT BUT AT THE END OF THOSE TWO DAYS THE RETORTS CONTAINING THE 67MR FARADAY OI TWO NEW COMPOUNDS SUBSTANCES WERE LINED WITH CRYSTALS WHICH ON EXAMINATION UNDER THE MICROSCOPE PROVED TO BE QUADRANGULAR PLATES RE SEMBLING THOSE OF THE PERCHLORIDE OF CARBON THERE WERE ALSO SOME RHOMBOIDAL CRYSTALS HERE AND THERE AFTER THE FORMATION OF THESE CRYSTALS THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE ABSORPTION IN THE RETORT HENCE CHLORINE HAD COMBINED  AND THE GAS WHICH REMAINED WAS CHLORINE UNMIXED WITH ANY THING ELSE EXCEPT A SLIGHT IMPURITY THE SOLID BODY ON EXAMINATION WAS FOUND TO BE VOLATILE SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL PRECIPITABLE BY WATER AND HAD THE SMELL AND OTHER PROPERTIES OF PERCHLORIDE OF CARBON HENCE THOUGH HEAT IN SEPARATING CHLORINE FROM THE PERCHLO RIDE OF CARBON PRODUCES ITS DECOMPOSITION LIGHT OCCASIONS ITS REPRODUCTION IT DISSOLVES IODINE VERY READILY ANDFORMS A BRILLIANT RED SOLUTION SIMILAR IN COLOUR TO THAT MADE BY PUTTING IODINE INTO SULPHURET OF CARBON OR CHLORIC ETHER IT DOES NOT EXERT ANY FARTHER ACTION ON IODINE AT COMMON TEMPERATURES AN ELECTRIC SPARK PASSED THROUGH A MIXTURE OF THE VAPOUR OF THE CHLORIDE WITH HYDROGEN DOES NOT CAUSE ANY DETONATION BUT WHEN A NUMBER ARE PASSED THE DECOMPOSITION IS GRADUALLY EFFECTED AND MURIATIC ACID IS FORMED WHEN HYDROGEN AND THE VAPOUR OF THE PROTOCHLORIDE ARE PASSED THROUGH A RED HOT TUBE THERE IS A COMPLETE DECOMPOSITION EFFECTED MURIATIC ACID GAS BEING FORMED AND CHARCOAL DEPOSITED THE MIXED VAPOUR AND GAS BURN WITH FLAME AS THEY ARRIVE IN THE HOT PART OF THE TUBE THE VAPOUR OF THE PROTOCHLORIDE DETONATES READILY BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK WITH A MIXTURE OF OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN GASES AND A COMPLETE DECOMPOSITION IS EFFECTED IT WILL NOT DETONATE WITH THE VAPOUR OF WATER SULPHUR AND PHOSPHORUS BOTH DISSOLVE IN IT BUT EXERT NO 68OF CHLORINE AND CARBON C DECOMPOSING ACTION AT TEMPERATURES AT OR BELOW THE BOILING POINT OF THE CHLORIDE THE HOT SOLUTION OF SULPHUR BECOMES A SOLID CRYSTALLINE MASS BY COOLING PHOSPHORUS DECOMPOSES IT AT A RED HEAT ITS ACTION ON METALS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PERCHLO RIDE WHEN PASSED OVER THEM AT A RED HEAT IT FORMS CHLO RIDES AND LIBERATES CHARCOAL POTASSIUM DOES NOT ACT ON IT IMMEDIATELY AT COMMON TEMPERATURES  BUT WHEN HEATED IN ITS VAPOUR BURNS BRILLIANTLY AND DEPOSITS CHARCOAL WHEN PASSED OVER HEATED METALLIC OXIDES CHLORIDES OF THE METALS ARE FORMED AND CARBONIC OXIDE OR CARBONIC ACID AC CORDING TO THE STATE OF OXIDATION OF THE METAL WHEN ITS VAPOUR IS TRANSMITTED OVER HEATED LIME BARYTA OR STRONTIA THE SAME BRILLIANT COMBUSTION IS PRODUCED AS WITH THE PER CHLORIDE WHILST ENGAGED IN ANALYZING THIS CHLORIDE OF CARBON FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING THE PROPORTIONS OF ITS ELEMENTS I ENDEAVOURED AT FIRST TO FIND HOW MUCH CHLORINE WAS LIBERATED FROM A CERTAIN WEIGHT OF PERCHLORIDE DURING ITS CONVERSION INTO PROTOCHLORIDE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE DISTILLED THE PER CHLORIDE THROUGH RED HOT TUBES INTO SOLUTION OF NITRATE OF SILVER RECEIVING THE GAS INTO TUBES FILLED WITH AND IMMERSED IN THE SAME SOLUTION BUT I COULD NEVER GET ACCURATE RESULTS IN THIS WAY FROM THE DIFFICULTY OF PRODUCING A COMPLETE DECOMPOSITION AND ALSO FROM THE FORMATION OF CHLORIC ACID 5 GRAINS OF PERCHLORIDE DISTILLED IN THIS MANNER GAVE 43 GRAINS OF CHLORIDE OF SILVER WHICH ARE EQUIVALENT TO 1O6 GRAINS OF CHLORINE BUT SOME OF THE CHLORIDE EVIDENTLY PASSED UNDECOMPOSED AND CRYSTALLIZED IN THE TUBE 7 GRAINS OF THE PURE PROTOCHLORIDE WERE PASSED OVER RED 69MR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS HOT PURE BARYTA IN A GLASS TUBE A VERY BRILLIANT COMBUSTION WITH FLAME TOOK PLACE CHLORIDE OF BARIUM AND CARBONIC ACID WERE PRODUCED AND A LITTLE CHARCOAL DEPOSITED WHEN THE TUBE WAS COLD THE BARYTES WAS DISSOLVED IN NITRIC ACID AND THE CHLORINE PRECIPITATED BY NITRATE OF SILVER 94 GRAINS OF DRY CHLORIDE OF SILVER WERE OBTAINED  2 3 GRAINS OF CHLORINE OTHER EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE WITH LIME WHICH GAVE RESULTS VERY NEAR TO THIS THE QUANTITY OF CHLORIDE BEING RA THER LESS 3 GRAINS OF PURE PROTOCHLORIDE WERE PASSED OVER PER OXIDE OF COPPER HEATED RED HOT IN AN IRON TUBE AND THE GAS RECEIVED OVER MERCURY 85 CUBIC INCHES OF CARBONIC ACID GAS CAME OVER MIXED WITH 1 OF A CUBIC INCH OF COMMON AIR THESE 35 CUBIC INCHES ARE NEARLY EQUAL TO 449 OF A GRAIN OF CARBON THESE EXPERIMENTS INDICATE THE COMPOSITION OF THE FLUID CHLORIDE OF CARBON TO BE I PROPORTION OF CHLORINE AND I OF CARBON OR 35 OF THE FORMER AND 57 OF THE LATTER THE DIF FERENCE BETWEEN THESE THEORETICAL NUMBERS AND THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS IS NOT TOO GREAT TO HAVE ARISEN FROM ERRORS IN WORKING ON SUCH SMALL QUANTITIES OF THE SUBSTANCE A MIXTURE OF EQUAL VOLUMES OF OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN WAS MADE AND 2 VOLUMES OF IT DETONATED WITH THE VAPOUR OF THE PROTPCHLORIDE IN EXCESS OVER MERCURY BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK THE EXPANSION WAS VERY NEARLY TO 4 VOLUMES OF THESE X WERE MURIATIC ACID AND THE REST PURE CARBONIC OXIDE AND CALOMEL HAD BEEN FORMED ITS PRESENCE BEING ASCERTAINED BY POTASH HENCE IT APPEARS THAT 1 VOLUME OF HYDROGEN AND HALF A VOLUME OF OXYGEN HAD DECOMPOSED 1 PROPORTION OF THE PROTOCHLORIDE FORMING THE TWO VOLUMES OF MURIATIC 7OO CHLORINE AND CARBON C ACID GAS AND 1 VOLUME OF CARBONIC OXIDE AND THAT AT THE INTENSE TEMPERATURE PRODUCED WITHIN THE TUBE BY THE INFLAMMATION THE REST OF THE OXYGEN AND THE MERCURY HAD DECOMPOSED A FARTHER PORTION OF THE SUBSTANCE GIVING RISE TO THE SECOND VOLUME OF THE CARBONIC OXIDE AND TO THE CALOMEL A MIXTURE OF 2 VOLUMES OF HYDROGEN AND I VOLUME OF OXYGEN WAS MADE AND 3 VOLUMES OF IT DETONATED WITH THE VAPOUR AS BEFORE AFTER COOLING THE EXPANSION WAS TO 6 VO LUMES 4 OF WHICH WERE MURIATIC ACID AND 2 CARBONIC OXIDE THERE WAS NO ACTION ON THE MERCURY IN THIS EXPERIMENT AGAIN 5 VOLUMES OF THE SAME MIXTURE BEING DETONATED WITH THE VAPOUR OF THE SUBSTANCE EXPANDED TO 975 VOLUMES OF WHICH 6 5 WERE ABSORBED BY WATER AND WERE MURIATIC ACID AND 35 WERE CARBONIC OXIDE MIXED WITH A VERY SMALL PORTION OF AIR INTRODUCED ALONG WITH THE FLUID CHLORIDE THESE EX PERIMENTS I THINK ESTABLISH THE COMPOSITION OF THE PROTO CHLORIDE OF CARBON AND PROVE THAT IT CONTAINS 1 PROPORTION OF EACH OF ITS ELEMENTS FROM A CONSIDERATION OF THE PROPORTIONS OF THESE TWO CHLO RIDES OF CARBON IT SEEMS EXTREMELY PROBABLE THAT ANOTHER MAY EXIST COMPOSED OF 2 PROPORTIONS OF CHLORINE COMBINED WITH I OF CARBON I HAVE SEARCHED ASSIDUOUSLY FOR SUCH A COMPOUND BUT AM UNDECIDED RESPECTING ITS PRODUCTION WHEN THE FLUID PROTOCHLORIDE WAS EXPOSED WITH CHLORINE TO SOLAR LIGHT CRYSTALS WERE FORMED AS BEFORE DESCRIBED THE GREATER NUMBER OF THESE WERE CERTAINLY THE PERCHLORIDE FIRST MENTIONED IN THIS PAPER BUT WHEN THE RETORT WAS EXAMINED BY A MICRO SCOPE SOME RHOMBOIDAL CRYSTALS WERE OBSERVED HERE AND THERE AMONG THOSE OF THE USUAL DENDRITIC AND SQUARE FORMS 717I AMR FARADAY ON TWO NEW COMPOUNDS THESE MAY PERHAPS BE THE REAL PERCHLORIDE BUT I HAD NOT TIME BEFORE THE SEASON OF BRIGHT SUNSHINE PASSED AWAY TO EXAMINE MINUTELY WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND MUST DEFER THIS WITH MANY OTHER POINTS TILL THE NEXT YEAR BRINGS MORE FAVOURABLE WEATHER COMPOUND OF IODINE CARBON AND HYDROGEN THE ANALOGY WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN CHLORINE AND IODINE NATURALLY SUGGESTED THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF AN IODIDE OF CARBON AND THE MEANS WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED WITH THE ONE ELEMENT OFFERED THE BEST PROMISE OF SUCCESS WITH THE OTHER IODINE AND OLEFIANT GAS WERE PUT IN VARIOUS PROPORTIONS INTO RETORTS AND EXPOSED TO THE SUNS RAYS AFTER A WHILE COLOURLESS CRYSTALS FORMED IN THE VESSELS AND A PARTIAL VACUUM WAS PRODUCED THE GAS IN THE VESSELS BEING THEN EXAMINED WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN NO HYDRIODIC ACID BUT ONLY PURE OLEFIANT GAS HENCE THE EFFECT HAD BEEN SIMPLY TO PRODUCE A COMPOUND OF THE IODINE WITH THE OLEFIANT GAS THE NEW BODY FORMED WAS OBTAINED PURE BY INTRODUCING A SOLUTION OF POTASH INTO THE RETORT WHICH DISSOLVED ALL THE FREE IODINE THE SUBSTANCE WAS THEN COLLECTED TOGETHER AND DRIED IT IS A SOLID WHITE CRYSTALLINE BODY HAVING A SWEET TASTE AND AROMATIC SMELL IT SINKS READILY IN SULPHURIC ACID OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY 185 IT IS FRIABLE IS NOT A CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY WHEN HEATED IT FIRST FUSES AND THEN SUBLIMES WITHOUT ANY CHANGE ITS VAPOUR CONDENSES INTO CRYSTALS WHICH ARE EITHER PRISMATIC OR IN PLATES ON BECOMING SOLID AFTER FUSION IT ALSO CRYSTALLIZES IN NEEDLES THE CRYSTALS ARE TRANSPARENT WHEN HIGHLY HEATED IT IS DECOMPOSED AND IODINE EVOLVED IT IS NOT READILY COMBUSTIBLE BUT WHENOF CHLORINE AND CARBON C 73 HELD IN THE FLAME OF A SPIRIT LAMP BURNS DIMINISHING THE FLAME AND GIVING OFF ABUNDANCE OF IODINE AND SOME FUMES OF HYDRIODIC ACID IT IS INSOLUBLE IN WATER OR IN ACID AND ALKALINE SOLUTIONS IT IS SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL AND ETHER AND MAY BE OBTAINED IN CRYSTALS FROM THESE SOLUTIONS THE ALCOHOLIC SOLUTION IS OF A VERY SWEET TASTE BUT LEAVES A PECU LIARLY SHARP BITING SENSATION ON THE TONGUE SULPHURIC ACID DOES NOT DISSOLVE IT WHEN HEATED IN THE ACID TO BETWEEN 00OO AND 400OO THE COMPOUND IS DECOM POSED APPARENTLY BY THE HEAT ALONE AND IODINE AND A GAS PROBABLY OLEFIANT GAS ARE LIBERATED SOLUTION OF POTASH ACTS ON IT VERY SLOWLY EVEN AT THE BOILING POINT BUT DOES GRADU ALLY DECOMPOSE IT THIS SUBSTANCE IS EVIDENTLY ANALOGOUS TO THE COMPOUND OF OLEFIANT GAS AND CHLORINE AND REMARKABLY RESEMBLES IT IN THE SWEETNESS OF ITS TASTE THOUGH IT DIFFERS FROM IT IN FORM C IT WILL WITH THAT BODY FORM A NEW CLASS OF COMPOUNDS AND THEY WILL REQUIRE NAMES TO DISTINGUISH THEM THE TERM CHLORIC ETHER APPLIED TO THE COMPOUND OF OLEFIANT GAS AND CHLORINE DID NOT AT ANY TIME CONVEY A VERY DEFINITE IDEA AND THE ANALOGOUS NAME OF IODIC ETHER WOULD EVIDENTLY BE VERY IMPROPER FOR A SOLID CRYSTALLINE BODY HEAVIER THAN SULPHURIC ACID MR BRANDE HAS SUG GESTED THE NAMES OF HYDRIODIDE OF CARBON AND HYDRO CHLORIDE OF CARBON FOR THESE TWO BODIES PERHAPS AS THEIR GENERAL PROPERTIES RANGE WITH THOSE OF THE COMBUSTIBLES WHILST THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE COMPOUND IS DECIDED BY THE SUPPORTER OF COMBUSTION WHICH IS IN COMBINATION THE TERMS OF HYDROCARBURET OF CHLORINE AND HYDROCARBURET OF IODINE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS APPROPRIATE FOR THEM MDCCCXXI L74 ALJMR FARADAY ONI TWO IEW COMPOUNDS C AS YET I HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN PROCURING AN IODIDE OF CARBON BUT I INTEND TO PURSUE THESE EXPERIMENTS IN A BRIGHTER SEASON OF THE YEAR AND EXPECT TO OBTAIN THIS COM POUND

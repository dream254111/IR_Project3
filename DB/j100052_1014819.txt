And her ultimate good depends upon her power of absorption more than upon the power of debtor countries to discharge their debt obliga tions POSSIBILITIES OF COOPERATION I should like to see Genoa followed by another conference of all the powers convened by the United States at which the question of debts and in debtedness might be treated as a world problem rather than as a matter of isolated arrangement by debtor and creditor countries I see no reason why neutral countries should not come in They benefited by the War and might well be asked to bear some of its cost by underwriting some of its debts an idea by the way which might also be applied to the liquidation of German liabilities for reparations If there is no such conference then I hope that the United States may be induced to come into some scheme of mutual help which may emerge from Genoa But after all either of these would be but a bad second best as compared with frank reassociation of the States in European affairs When therefore I am asked what the United States can do to help Europe I can only say that in my judgment she can do but little in iso lation but that she might do a great deal in association The Washington Conference did something towards world recovery and Genoa may do more but neither of them would have been necessary if there had been full understanding and cooperation be tween Europe and America I should like to see the problems which have emerged directly out of the War cleared out of the way as soon as possible and I should like to see the United States taking a hand in the clearance Then the Supreme War Council would no longer linger super fluous upon the stage and the course would be clear for an all embracing League of Nations in which the United States could take a leading part After all the conditions are different now from those obtaining two years ago In the first place there is a disposition now on the part of the League members to recast parts of the Covenant And in the second place an International Court of Justice is now part of the League organization It is the court for which the United States so long and honorably labored at the Hague and elsewhere It is anal ogous to the Supreme Court of the United States and is indeed largely the work of Mr Elihu Root the eminent United States citizen Will the United States come over and further help us SelfHelp Before American Cooperation in the Rehabilitation of Europe By JOHN JACOB ROGERS Washington D C Member of Congress from Massachusetts IS Americas cooperation indispen sable to European rehabilitation Before I attempt to answer this ques tion from my own viewpoint it may be interesting to note the attitude of Europe If we are to accept the utter ances of European statesmen the answer is unquestionably in the affirma tivethat American cooperation is in dispensable to European rehabilitation 156SELFHELP BEFORE AMERICAN COOPERATION VIEW OF EUROPE Speaking at Genoa on April 26 Lloyd George said I wish America were here We want America because she exercises a peculiar authority America could exercise an influence no other country could command Dr Walter Rathenau said Never did a nation hold the fate of the Con tinent in the hollow of her hand so indisputably as does the United States at this moment The Russian dele gates at Genoa said Financial assist ance from foreign sources is absolutely vital for the economic reconstruction of Russia The context and other similar remarks by the representatives of Russia make it clear that they were alluding to the United States As recently as the third of this month during the debate at Genoa the necessity for American participa tion in any rehabilitation of Europe was repeatedly mentioned In con nection with the financial report Dr Gomez of Portugal and other delegates emphasized the need of obtaining American support for European finan cial reconstruction LIKELIHOOD OF A RELIEF PROGRAM Of course the views of European ministers cannot bind America either 1 as to the course we should pursue or 2 even as to the real truth whether from the standpoint of Europe American aid is vital With these two points I shall deal later First I wish to discuss the likelihood that the United States as a government will embark upon an ambitious relief program Such a program might take the form 1 of cancelling or modifying the ten billion dollar debt now owed us by Europe or 2 of advancing further credits to the several countries of Europe in proportion to their need for the direct purpose of assisting in their fiscal and economic revival Speaking as a man in politics and seeking to deal with the question as one of fact stripped of any other consideration I say positively that I am convinced that America will never embark upon a general program of debt cancellation or money grants or loans to Europe The apparent exceptions seem to me only illustrations of the truth of my statement Just before Christmas Congress appropriated 20000000 for the purpose of supplying corn seed grain and wheat to starving Russians Last month Congress authorized the extending for twentyfive years of the payment of principal and interest of the debt incurred by Austria for the purchase of flour on condition that the other creditor nations should do the same There is now pending before Congress a bill authorizing the pay ment to Liberia of 5000000 which had been placed to the credit of that country in 1918 but never actually transferred to her in whole or in part This bill passed the House May 10 by the very close vote of 148 to 139 These three instances evidence I think the extreme limit to which the American Congressand I believe the American peopleis willing to go We are prepared to appropriate money to assist in relieving actual famine or other physical distress and we are prepared to make good our pledged word Thus far and no farther will we go Just possibly where we cannot help ourselves we may assent to postponement of interest payments We will not generally speaking for give debts and we will not loan large sums of money for European recon struction Please bear in mind that I am discussing neither what Europe needs to have us do nor what as a This address was delivered at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy May 13 1922 Editors note 157THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY matter of righteousness or for our own wellbeing we ought to do I am simply giving you my estimate of a fact and not of the wisdom or morality of a course of conduct THE NEED OF EUROPE We are now ready to appraise the condition of Europe as a whole today That condition as everyone knows is deplorable The three and onehalf years since the Armistice have been marked by further retrogression rather than by anticipated progression The continental countries almost without exception are deeper in the mire today than in 1918 The nations of Conti nental Europe have made small prog ress in balancing their budgets Def icits have arisen by leaps and bounds All countries have been reluctant to impose the absolutely essential taxes Instead their printing presses have been busy turning out more and yet more paper money of constantly diminishing value Their armies have been kept on approximately a war footing The reparation policy of the victorsfirst its uncertainty and later its devastating certaintyhas been a millstone about the necks of the van quished and the victors have suffered almost in ratio with them What is needed The curecannot be made simple or enjoyable The descent to an economic hell is easy but the ascent therefrom is extra ordinarily arduous I quote from Dr B M Anderson as follows Taxes must be greatly increased and public expenditures greatly diminished so that current revenues will not only meet current expenditures but will also suffice to permit some amortization of public debt This does not mean merely that budgets must be balanced since the term budget is often a misleading term which omits major items of expenditure Floating debts must be funded into longterm issues Drastic currency reform is called for aimed at an early restoration of actual gold redemption   Fluctuating paper money is the most serious single impedi ment to industrial progress in Europe A rational economic settlement of the Ger man indemnity question must replace the political settlement dictated to Germany in the spring of 1921 Germany should be made to pay what she can but France Belgium and Great Britain have nothing to gain by a continuance of the present demoralization of Germany  The financiers and premiers of Europe understand all this The difficulty is political Any ministry which today tried to do all these things would be likely to find itself tomorrow on the outside looking in So we find the manana policy generally prevalent in Europe and the return of sound fiscal methods becoming more and more difficult day by day The prospect is not a bright one Few keen observers breathe optimism for early rehabilitation It is imperative that European countries work tax save restrict imports to necessities and above all reverse the mad policy of printing bank notes But at the moment neither the will nor the way to do these things is manifest As Secretary Hughes has lately said Europe must face the facts Until she does there is no health in her or for her THE PART OF AMERICA I have just recited the gravest difficulties in European economics and the straightforward if the difficult way out It will be noted at once that the remedies involve selfhelp rather than the aid of outsiders I will go further I will assert that even if America were willing to pour her hundreds and thousands of millions into Europe these sums would not avail if Europe had not herself turned over a new 158SELFHELP BEFORE AMERICAN COOPERATION economic and governmental leaf To do so would be to put a patch of new cloth upon a suit of decayed material It is the old wine and new bottles idea all over again No creditor of a corporation will pour more money into the tottering business unless it holds some promise of being able to utilize the new capital to advantage and pull itself out of the difficulties as a result Such a transaction is sending bad money after good and impoverishes the creditor without alleviating the straits of the corporation Selfhelp I repeat must come first Of course Europe would be glad of  easy money but its state of mind cannot be evidential to us of America THE PRACTICAL PROGRAM If Europe does her part if she shows her willingness to sacrifice and struggle what then I believe that in time she could work her way out and regain her economic feet But new capital would unquestionably simplify and shorten the struggle The greatest reservoir of new capital is America Mr Hughes has on two recent occasions thus explained the next step Credit does not precede but follows confidence and the first re quirement of those who demand justice and security is to give justice and security And again only recently he said Russia needs credit but it is idle to expect credit unless there is a basis for credit That basis for credit cannot be supplied from the out side That basis for credit has got to be supplied inside of Russia And what is true in the case of Rlissia is true in its degree of the rest of Europe Governor Harding of the Federal Reserve Board in an address delivered last week put the whole case into two sentences I have no doubt he said that the financial interests of this country recognize the great bene fits which would accrue to American agriculture commerce and industry from the economic and political stabili zation of Europe but the destinies of European nations are after all in their own hands When those things are done which are necessary to win the confidence of American investors it would be found that not even the tragedies of the World War can change the immutable law that money and credit tend to flow where they can be most safely and profitably employed Assuming that Europe embarks upon a policy of practical and self sacrificing selfhelp and assuming that the American government will neither cancel the debts nor make large and general government loans to Europe what is left How can American capital be made available for Europe There are three major possibilities 1 By the expenditures of American tourists in Europe This while well enough as far as it goes is a relatively small matterperhaps 200000000 or less a year 2 By the exchange of American capital for European commodities im ported into America This involves the whole question of the protection of American industries with which for many reasons I do not care to deal here It may perhaps suffice to say that in my opinion the purchase of European goods in sufficient quan tities to give Europe in exchange American capital in sums at all adequate for her needs would result in the most extreme business depres sion that this country has ever known and that would be disastrous alike to America and to Europe 3 The third possibility of fur nishing American capital to Europe is as the result of purchasing European securities by American individuals and 159THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY private corporations Such purchases cannot be forced Investments of this nature come as a result of con fidence on the part of the investors and nothing else RECENT FOREIGN INVESTMENTS Recent transactions of this character are of interest From January 1 1922 to April 14 1922 there have been float ed in the United States foreign loans amounting in the aggregate to at least 350000000 See appendix to this ar ticle page 161 for details If the rate for the first three and onehalf months of 1922 is maintained for the remainder of the year the 1922 total will mean that about one and onefifth billions of dollars of American capital have in one year been invested in foreign securities It is important to notice the geo graphical distribution of these invest ments 109000000 has gone to the Netherlands and her colonies about 84000000 has gone to colonies of the British Empire 70250000 to Canada and 13500000 to Australia 63 500000 has been invested in Latin America The remainder less than 100000000 has gone to the rehabili tation of Continental Europe Of this sum about 70000000 has entered France Roumania has received four and onethird millions and Czecho slovakia 14 millions Both these last mentioned loans were negotiated within the last few weeks and unquestionably represent recognition on the part of American bankers and investors of the fact that these two countries are mak ing a conscientious effort to achieve a sounder fiscal regime It is however a noteworthy fact that only about onefourth of our foreign loans is going to our European associates in the World War who certainly need our capital most The reason is of course clear the investors of America are not generally satisfied that such loans present a reasonable degree of security In spite of dangers and doubts as to European investments we are loaning abroad at the rate of over a billion of dollars a year All this vast sum goes directly to the rehabilitation of the rest of the world In my opinion this general method is as far as America will go in giving succor to Europe It follows of course that the greater the sum invested in safe European offerings of securities the larger the usefulness of the part of America in the revivifying of Europe But even here from the standpoint of America there is a peril which must not be overlooked The serious con dition caused in the United States today by the large exportation of capital prompted the State Depart ment in March to issue a warning to American bankers and to express a desire to be more fully informed on prospective foreign loans It is ob viously true that every American dollar exported is hors de combat as far as its employment in America goes A single dollar cannot work on both sides of the Atlantic Secretary Hoover said recently A billion dollars spent upon American railways will give more employment to our people more advance to our industry more assistance to our farmers than twice that sum expended outside the frontiers of the United States and there will be greater security for the investor Mr George M Reynolds of the Continental and Commercial National Bank of Chicago says Any proposal to furnish Europe with more capital should receive the closest scrutiny If certain of the European nations are impoverished their position will not be greatly improved by Americas financing sales of goods without adequate considera tion of the risks involved or thought of the extent to which capital should be exported 160SELFHELP BEFORE AMERICAN COOPERATION If Europe is impoverished improvement of the condition of her peoples will not be brought about by forcing America to the same condition Too much emphasis can be placed on what America can do for Europe and not enough on what Europe can and must do for herself Or as Mr Schwab puts it A prosperous America can help the world but a prostrate America cannot I cite these authorities to show that in the judgment of many we must not go on indefinitely even if conditions are otherwise auspicious in making investments in Europe To do so will cripple our own business life and bring about domestic disaster and industrial stagnation And from the trans Atlantic standpoint Europe needs a strong America today almost as much as in 1917 and 1918 The policy of America must be to pull Europe up not to allow ourselves to be pulled down Is AMERICAN COOPERATION INDISPENSABLE  And so I deviously come to the question which is the topic for this section Theoretically the answer is No Europe could if she had the deter mined will and courage regain eco nomic stability without us Practically speaking what shall we answer I find it difficult to give a yes or a no Perhaps we can safely say that Amer ica could greatly curtail the route back to a normal Europe But as we have seen neither the cancellation of debts nor the adoption of the role of a Lord Bountiful seems likely to command the support of the American people Nor is the exchange of European commodi ties for American dollars a safe expedient save within rather narrow bounds American capital will how ever within suitable limits of amount be available hereafter as in the past 12 for attractive offerings of European securities To this extent only as I read the future will America play a direct financial part in the rehabilitation of Europe The sooner Europe learns this the better Waiting for a rich uncle to make a large gift is a danger ous pastime for the nephew The salvation of Europe lies through the thorny path of selfhelp Whatever else might beeven whatever else ought to beI believe the foregoing statement is the literal fact We shall do a kindness to Europe if without equivocation or uncertainty we make known our position APPENDIX Annexed hereto is a list of some of the securities enumerated in general by countries only which have been floated in Americaand in

maintained for the entire calendar year 1922 would represent total American investments in foreign securities of just under 1200000000 As a matter of fact the actual figures probably are and will be considerably larger I make this statement because the figures quoted in general involve only the more important issues and only those which have come to the attention of the State Department the Federal Reserve Board or the larger banks of New York The known investments of American capital in foreign securities during the calendar year 1921 were 628000000 Thus the total known foreign invest ments of America from January 1 1921 to the middle of April 1922 were just under a billion dollars Of this investments in Canada account for 267000000 in France 200000 000 in the Netherlands 109000000 in Brazil 102000000 and in the Argentine 910000002 These five countriesonly one a European ally thus account for nearly 80 per cent of our foreign investments 2The foregoing figures are converted into

Washington D C ONE of the peculiar characteristics of the human mind is that while it has been taught that the world is round it continues to think in terms of the earth with a flat surface This is demonstrated by the fact that humanity does not appreciate that certain practices cannot go on or cer tain occurrences happen in a distant and socalled isolated nation without affecting the rest of the world How few realize that the emotions thoughts and actions of the people of South Africa necessarily interweave with those of the people in our land Just as we have learned that all utterances are caught on sound waves and circle the earth so any action of any group of people in any one place of the world sends forth vibrations that cross and recross and interweave with the daily existence of those of distant lands As the stone tossed into the center of the pool causes wavelets to reach the circumference and disturb the entire pool so the actions of any 162

by far the finest plants of Polypodium vulgare and Dryopteris Dryopteris I ever saw and I have found lots of them in England Scotland Wales France Canada and the United States AMERICAN FERN SOCIETY The Brooklyn Meeting A meeting of the Society was held as announced at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden on the afternoon and evening of December 29th in connection with the American Association for the Advancement of Science Thirtyone persons members and their friends regis tered as present The authorities of the Garden re ceived us hospitably and provided for us a convenient lectureroom with plenty of wall and table space for exhibits The afternoon was spent in visiting under guidance of Dr Benedict the many points of interest at the Garden First came the conservatories where winter instruction in horticulture for public school children was going on The conservatories contain a consid erable number of economic plants and in them Dr Benedict has gathered what is undoubtedly the largest collection in the world of the different forms of the Boston fern These show an astonishing range of variation with fronds plane or ruffled one to five pinnate and three or four inches to six feet in length Next was a cold but interesting walk about the outdoor portion of the Garden We visited the Japanese garden planned and constructed by Japanese experts the rock ery the local flora garden in which it is planned to have growing representatives of all species found wild within 100 miles of New York City and last but far 19AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL from least the site of the Societys fern garden It occupies a shaded hillside on which large stones and logs have been arranged to reproduce as far as possible natural woodland conditions Next season there is to be an artificial brook and then there will be no excuse for our ferns if they fail to make themselves at home At six oclock the party proceeded to New York where we were joined by a delegation from the Sullivant Moss Society meeting and dined exotically at a Chinese restaurant on such mysterious dainties as Chow Mein and Gem Get One or two timid ones were inclined to partake of this nourishment only telepathetically and ocularly the Secretary is not responsible for these words but the rest of us found them very agreeable Nothing venture nothing have At the evening session also at the Garden the walls and even the windows of our room were well covered with exhibits of specimens The Curator showed one of Mr Bigelows sets of Dryopteris hybrids and the Philippine Lygodiums from the Society herbarium Mr Ware exhibited more than 80 miscellaneous speci mens from Europe and America An interesting feature of his exhibit were some very tall plants mounted on folding sheets which when opened out showed the specimens at full length without bending Mr Killip brought in 50 or more Jamaican f rns notable for their beauty of form Mr Carhart in addition to a set of specimens illustrating his talk showed a sheet of the Dryopteris Clintonianacristata cross mentioned in his recent paper on New Jersey ferns in the JOURNAL and a few other interesting specimens Mr Brandegee exhibited a very fine set of 54 copyrighted photographs of New England ferns which he has recently brought out and is offering for sale Our Presidentelect Mr Palmer showed a series of specimens illustrating tendencies and range of variation 20AMERICAN FERN SOCIETY in Botrychium virginianum Lycopodium adpressum Onoclea sensibilis Osmunda regalis Polypodium occi dentale P vulgare and Polystichum acrostichoides par ticularly a perfectly bipinnate frond of the last growing from the same rootstock with nearly normal fronds pointed out the external causes which he believes have produced some of the variations and explained others as probable reversions to an earlier type Mr Winslow described the localities at which the male fern has been found in Vermont and gave a history of their discovery The first four of them were found by womena cir cumstance which no less a person than a President of the Fern Society has suggested may be explained by the fact that the male fern was the one concerned Mr Carhart told of finding growing together in an old excavation typical Lycopodium inundatum and three related plantsL inundatum var Bigelovii L adpressum and L alopecuroides which were there readily dis tinguishable and pointed out some of the characters which separate them Mr Killip told something of the localities from which his ferns came We expect to hear further from all of these papers in the JOURNAL The meeting closed at a late hour with a vote of thanks to Dr Benedict and the authorities of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for the much that they had done to make it a success C A WEATHERBY Secretary ANNUAL REPORTS OF THE SOCIETY Report of the President for 1916 The officers reports following this will give details of the work of the year in the different departments I will refer to them briefly in a general way and then speak of a few matters to which I think attention should be called The financial condition of the Society has 21AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL improved At the close of the year all bills had been paid a sum set aside to meet the expense of printing a list of the specimens in the herbarium and a balance carried over to help meet the expenses of the coming year which promise to be heavier than usual In addition there is now a permanent fund of 10000 In making up the budget two years ago I advised that all current expenses should be met from regular receipts and that the income from sale of back numbers of the JOURNAL always an uncertain amount be set aside as a reserve fund to be expended only in case of emer gency and if not thus expended at the close of the year to be placed in the Permanent Fund for which our constitution now provides This plan has been followed and as a result the Permanent Fund has increased to 10000 The amount is small of course but it is a beginning and I hope this same plan will be followed in the future and if so these receipts from sales of JOURNALS combined with the fees of the new members whom we believe will come in occasionally as life members will ere long give the Society a permanent fund that will help toward financial stability and be of appreciable service in carrying out and adding to its various activi ties The JOURNAL has been during the year in the hands of the same able editors who have conducted it in the past They are all giving much time and service to the Society for which it is under great obligations it is to be hoped the Society may long be able to retain their services in this capacity The herbarium under the fostering care of the curator shows an increasing number of specimens each year It is expected to have a list of specimens printed in the near future The Society has occasionally an opportunity to acquire books or pamphlets that might be the nucleus of a library but having a library implies some permanent and secure place in which it can be kept If the plan for a library 22AMERICAN FERN SOCIETY is ever carried out and the herbarium continues to grow it will mean that the time will come when arrangements will have to be made with some large institution willing to provide fireproof room and cases and where herbarium and library can be kept together and cared for This may seem far in the future but it is something the Society should have in mind The report of the secre tary shows that the Society is in possession of better files of its own publications than ever before and that the affairs of his office are in the best of condition The Society is much indebted to Mr Bigelow and those who have assisted him in securing the material for determining and sending out to applicant members the sets of hybrid ferns They should be of much assistance in the study of these often perplexing forms I feel that the members should make a larger use than they apparently do of the facilities the Society affords for the exchange or gift of specimens The membership of the Society is slowly and steadily increasing The loss of some members each year is inevitable New members must be secured to more than fill the places of those lost if our number is to increase Membership in the Society appeals only to those who have an interest in our specialty for this reason new members must come almost entirely through the help of those now in the Society and the increase we have is good evidence that we are getting such help May we not have the same help the coming year only more of it A little work from each one will show large results when brought together on the books of the treasurer After three years service as your president it is my good fortune to be able to retire leaving the editorship of the JOURNAL and the offices of Secretary and Treasurer in the hands of the men who have ably cared for them in the past and who are working in harmony for the good of the Society The members may thus expect 23AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL increased growth and prosperity under the guidance of your new president and I feel sure he will receive the same cordial support that has been accorded me during my term of office C H BISSELL President Report of the Secretary for 1916 The Society has had a reasonably prosperous year and one with its fair share of interesting events Through the kindness of Dr Grout a field meeting not so well attended as it should have been was held in July at his cabin in Newfane Vt and a winter meeting took place at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden on December 29th Both have been or will be reported elsewhere With the cooperation of a few others notably Dr Dowell who made the critical determinations Mr Bigelow prepared and issued to members sets of the northeastern species of Dryopteris and their hybrids Thirtyseven sets of from 15 to 17 sheets each were sent out and they contained material of all but one of the possible hybrids of our six common species of the spinulosa group So far as the Secretary is aware this is the first time that so nearly complete a series of these puzzling plants authentically determined has been made available Besides these sets three species Scolopendrium vulgare Schizaea pusilla and Lygodium palmatum have been offered to members Those who are able to get speci mens of the rarer ferns in sufficient quantity should continue these offerings Some years ago Prof Hopkins then Secretary pointed out the possible usefulness of a Society library Until the Society has permanent headquarters and much more money than at present it cannot maintain a library of any size but it can keep as complete a file as possible of its own official organs and publications at the disposal 24AMERICAN FERN SOCIETY of members With this end in view a set of Volumes 720 inclusive of the Fern Bulletin has been acquired by an exchange with Prof Clute and is now ready to lend Three members have already availed themselves of it and it is hoped that many more may do so in future Mr Christensens generous gift of 18 reprints and originals of his works is an even more notable addition to the Societys literary assets At the annual election an amendment to the Consti tution providing a method of election of honorary members and limiting their number was adopted Its text is as follows Amend Article III by adding SECTION 6 Honorary members may be chosen when unanimously nominated by the Council and their names submitted to the members at the next succeeding annual election Threefourths of the vote cast on the question shall be required for election and the total number cast must be at least twenty Honorary members shall be entitled to all privileges of the Society without payment of dues The number of such members shall not exceed five at any one time During the year two persons have changed from ordinary to life membership making a total of three life members now on the rolls Two members Mr Laird and Mr Bates have died and news of the earlier deaths of two others has reached the Secretary for the first time eleven have resigned and five have been dropped for nonpayment of dues Twentysix new members have been received The total membership at the date of this report December 31 1916 not including the one honorary member is 261 a gain of six over last year and a new record for the Society The growth is small but it seems to be normal and healthy and best of all to have been brought about by the co6peration of a number of the present members in securing new ones That is the only sure way we must all see to it that growth continues during the coming year C A WEATHERBY Secretary 25Report of the Treasurer for 1916 Owing to the efficient working of the budget only two orders from the Council were necessary during the year One was for the unforeseen expense of binding the Societys duplicate set of the Fern Bulletin the other at the close of the year to issue a larger number of the JOURNAL for No 4 which seemed wise since sufficient funds were available Two special orders were adopted one to transfer 5500 from the emergency fund to the permanent fund and to make the balance available for regular expenses the other to set aside 2500 to print a catalogue of the herbarium of the Society It seems as though more members might remember the special illustrating fund with gifts

Report of the Curator for 1916 The Society herbarium is now being kept in cases provided for it at the State Normal College Kent Ohio Members of the Society or others interested who may happen to be passing through this section are invited to stop and see it 27AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL The Herbarium now numbers 2426 mounted sheets 192 sheets having been added since the last report up to January 1 1917 Dr O E Jennings gave 19 sheets Prof F T Mac Farland 2 sheets Mr C L Gruber 4 sheets Mr C H Bissell 114 sheets while 55 sheets were donated by the members who attended the Society field meeting at Syracuse Some 200 much needed genus covers were purchased in September and placed in immediate use Eight members borrowed material for study during the year and several were helped in making identifi cations of specimens sent in L S HOPKINS Curator Report of the Editors for 1916 The editors of the FERN JOURNAL are concerned with two things the material received for publication both as to its quality and quantity and the amount of money available for its publication The following quotation from a recent letter will serve very appropriately as a basis for a discussion of the present status of these editorial problems I did not realize that the FERN JOURNAL was so favored as to have so much material neither did I wish to bother you by having you tell me so much about it Nevertheless I am glad to know it I wonder if we could not get money enough somehow to unload all of the material into one good fat copy of the JOURNAL I realize the Society is small and doubtless our finances will not let us be very ambitious in the matter of pub lications Regarding the amount of material we have usually articles for two numbers in advance that is for six months ahead In general articles are published in the order of receipt but occasionally there is reason 28AMERICAN FERN SOCIETY for holding one longer or publishing it sooner An article by one of the editors waited in typewritten form over a year before it appeared in a 1916 issue Some articles especially illustrated ones for which the cost of illustration has been privately contributed may get into the JOURNAL immediately The mechanical task of making up a given supply of copy to fit a thirtytwo page issue of the JOURNAL is such as to make it necessary at times to violate the sacred principle of priority We do not wish however to discourage contributions of articles We cannot have too many good ones long or short Regarding the financial phase of the JOURNAL prob lems there are two ways in which we can increase the size of the JOURNAL First by increasing the member ship and list of subscribers the Treasurer will come to have a surplus over and above the budget estimate of receipts and this surplus may be awarded the JOUR NAL as was done with the last issue for 1916 when a forty page number was published Second the Treas urer is ready to receive extra contributions specifically for the purpose of increasing the size of future numbers From the same member who was quoted above comes this further suggestion If others feel as I do perhaps we can put in enough to clean up a lot of the back work available for the JOURNAL How many will be willing to share in the extra expense of issuing a sixtyfour page number It is a question whether the extra pages will mean added value to you Let the Editors know by a postcard if willing As the Treasurers report shows contributions for illustrating purposes to the amount of 450 were re ceived in 1916 for which the Editors hereby express their thanks R C BENEDICT E

his experiences with a fern garden Many of our other members have tried their hands more or less at growing ferns If enough will send in say during the next two months notes long or short about their experiences the Editors will issue a fern garden number of the JOURNAL Mr Carhart and Mr Killip are following the excellent example set by Mr Topping some time ago The former is to give the Society herbarium a complete set of the New Jersey ferns he has collected and the latter a set of his Jamaican ferns What an herbarium we 30AMERICAN FERN SOCIETY should have if all the states and all foreign collections by our members could be represented that way Our new member Bro MarieVictorin is engaged in monographing the ferns of Quebec and desires to correspond and exchange specimens with any one who has collected in Quebec or in regions adjacent to the boundaries of that province Address Bro Marie Victorin Longueuil College Longueuil P Q Canada Botanists interested in plant distlibution in

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1013559,A FUNCTIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT AS A FACTOR IN INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY,I242651,THE FUNTIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT A FUNCTIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT AS A FACTOR IN INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCYI BY ERNEST MARTIN HOPKINS MANAGER EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT THE CURTIS PUBLISHING COMPANY PHILADELPHIA THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACT PERTAINING TO INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT TODAY IS THE ATTENTION WHICH IS BEING GIVEN TO THE PROBLEMS OF PERSONNEL RECOGNITION IS BEING GIVEN TO THE TRUTH THAT NEW SOURCES OF POWER AND EVOLUTION OF MECHANICAL PROCESSES HAVE BUT CHANGED THE POINTS IN METHODS OF PRODUCTION AT WHICH THE HUMAN FACTOR IS ESSENTIAL WITHOUT CHANGING TO ANY DEGREE THE ULTIMATE DEPENDENCE UPON IT THE IMPRESSIVE THING IS NOT THAT SOME MEN RECOGNIZE THE IM PORTANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER FOR THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE OF SOME IT IS THAT SUCH RECOGNITION IS SO RAPIDLY BECOMING GENERAL SINCE IT HAS BEEN SO LONG DELAYED YET THE CAUSES ARE OBVIOUS POWER CAN BE PRODUCED FOR A AND Z WITH LITTLE VARIATION IN COST TO EITHER PLANT DESIGN HAS BEEN STANDARDIZED UNTIL ONE CAN GAIN SMALL ADVAN TAGE OVER ANOTHER HEREIN THE SAME MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT CAN BE SECURED BY ONE AS BY THE OTHER THERE IS NO LONGER MARKED ADVAN TAGE POSSIBLE TO THE THOROUGHLY PROGRESSIVE HOUSE OVER ANOTHER EQUALLY PROGRESSIVE AND INTELLIGENT IN THE SECURING OF RAW MATERIALS IN THE MECHANICAL PROCESSES OF MANUFACTURE OR IN THE METHODS OF 1 REPRINTED FROM THE SEPTEMBER VOLUME OF THE ANNALS THIS ARTICLE IS OF SUCH EXCELLENCE AND HAS MET WITH SUCH A FAVORABLE RECEPTION THAT THE EDITORS FEEL JUSTIFIED IN REPRINTING IT HERE IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS VOLUME AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE68 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PROMOTION AND DISTRIBUTION WHEREIN LIES POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE OF A OVER Z IN THE COMPETITION BETWEEN THEM OR THE QUESTION MAY READ FOR Z HOW MAY HE RETAIN HIS PROSPERITY IN COMPETITION WITH A THIS IS ONE PHASE OF THE COMPELLING LOGIC WHICH IS LEADING TO THE STUDY OF PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY EVIDENT THAT THE STATEMENT FREQUENTLY MADE IS UNIVERSALLY TRUE IF INTERPRETED BROADLY THAT THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYE ARE INEXTRICABLY BOUND TOGETHER THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE MUTUAL INTERESTS OF EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYES IS SO GREAT THAT THESE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH LONGER KEPT SUBORDINATE UNDER ANY CIRCUM STANCES BUT THE UTILITARIAN ADVANTAGE TO EMPLOYERS INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THESE PROBLEMS HAS BECOME SO PLAIN THAT THE PRESENT GENERAL INTEREST IN THEM AMONG INDUSTRIAL LEADERS CAN MOST POSITIVELY BE ASCRIBED TO THE FACT THAT WHATEVER ELSE THEY ARE THEY ARE A VITAL CONCERN OF GOOD BUSINESS IT WAS LOGICAL WHEN INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT REACHED THE STAGE THAT ITS PRACTICES COULD BE DEFINED AND THE PRELIMINARY STUDIES MADE TO SEPARATE THE GOOD AND THE BAD IN COURSE OF REDUCING SUCH MAN AGEMENT TO A SCIENCE THAT ATTENTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOCUSSED FIRST ON PROCESSES MACHINES AND BUILDINGS THESE THINGS NEEDED TO BE RIGHT BEFORE THE WORKER COULD REALIZE HIS POSSIBILITIES IT IS TO BE RECOGNIZED HOWEVER THAT THOUGH THE WORD EFFICIENCY CAME INTO WIDE USE DURING THIS STAGE OF DEALING WITH INANIMATE FACTORS THE WORD IS ENTITLED TO THE FAR BROADER SIGNIFICANCE WHICH CARRIES AN IMPORT OF ALLROUND EFFECTIVENESS INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY UNDER PROPER DEFINITION DOES MEAN AND MUST BE UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN RIGHT WORKERS AND RIGHT CONDITIONS FOR THEM AS DISTINCTLY AS RIGHT MACHINES AND CONDITIONS DESIGNED FOR THEIR BEST OPERATION THIS IS THE BROAD PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE FUNCTIONALIZED EMPLOY MENT DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IT IS SIMPLY THE APPLICA TION OF THE SAME REASONING TO FINDING AND MAINTAINING THE LABOR SUPPLY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN APPLIED IN INDUSTRY TO PROBLEMS OF BUILDING EQUIPMENT MECHANICAL SUPERVISION AND THE METHODS BY WHICH BUSINESS IS DESPATCHED THERE IS THIS GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ESTABLISHING A FUNCTIONALIZED DEPARTMENT FOR EMPLOYMENT AND CORRELATED RESPONSIBILITIES THAN IN ESTABLISHING A DEPARTMENT FOR ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE THAT HOW EVER FRANKLY MEN WILL ACKNOWLEDGE LIMITATIONS ON SOME SIDES FEWTHE FTJNTIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT 69 WILL ADMIT OR BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE NOT PARTICULARLY PERSPICACIOUS IN THEIR JUDGMENTS OF MEN THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF THOSE OF CIR CUMSCRIBED VISION WHOSE ADVANTAGES HAVE BEEN FEW AND WHOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPING BREADTH IN THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES HAVE BEEN LIMITED AS IS THE CASE WITH MANY MINOR EXECUTIVES OR SUB FOREMEN SUCH AN ONE FEELS PERHAPS NOT UNNATURALLY THAT HIS PRESTIGE WITH THE NEW EMPLOYE IS IMPAIRED IF EMPLOYMENT IS SE CURED THROUGH SOME DEPARTMENT OUTSIDE HIS OWN MOREOVER HE IS LIKELY TO ASCRIBE TO THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT NO OTHER BASIS OF APPRAISAL THAN HE HIMSELF HAS USED AND WITH THIS AS A PREMISE HE ARGUES THAT HIS OWN INTUITION IS BETTER THAN THAT OF ONE WHO LACKS HIS OWN INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORK FOR WHICH HE IS RESPONSIBLE ALMOST INVARIABLY TOO HE FAILS TO VALUE TO REASONABLE EXTENT THE LOSS TO HIS OWN WORK WHICH COMES FROM THE WASTE OF TIME INVOLVED IN INTERVIEWING AND EMPLOYING EVEN IF HE UNDERTAKES TO DO THIS WITH SUCH CARE AS THAT OF WHICH HE MAY BE CAPABLE TOO MUCH EMPHASIS MAY NOT BE PLACED HOWEVER ON THE DIFFI CULTIES INCIDENT TO ESTABLISHING THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT FOR THE FOREMOST CONCERNS HAVE SO DEFINITELY ACCEPTED THE PRINCIPLE THAT IT IS BOUND TO BE ACCEPTED GENERALLY IT SHOULD SIMPLY BE RECOGNIZED THAT SUCH A DEPARTMENT CANNOT FULFILL ITS FUNCTION TO BECOME A LARGE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE SUCCESS OF THE BUSINESS UNLESS IT BE GIVEN RECOG NITION AND ENDORSEMENT SUFFICIENT TO GAIN FOR IT CO6PERATION FROM THE DEPARTMENTS WITH WHOSE PROBLEMS OF PERSONNEL IT MUST BE IN CON TACT A LARGE RESPONSIBILITY RESTS UPON THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT TO WORK CAREFULLY AND CONSIDERATELY WITH OPEN MIND AND APPRECIA TION OF THE PROBLEMS OF OTHERS BUT EVEN SO OCCASIONAL SUPPORT IN THE WAY OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM ABOVE WILL BE NEEDED TO GIVE THE DE PARTMENT ACCESS TO SOME PARTS OF THE FIELD WHEREIN ITS WORK SHOULD BE DONE THIS RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO THE PLACE OF THE DEPARTMENT IN THE ORGANIZATION THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE ANSWER IF THE INSTALLATION OF THE WORK IS MADE IN GOOD FAITHIT MUST BE IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE TOPMOST MANAGEMENT WHERE ITS PROBLEMS CAN BE PASSED UPON PROMPTLY AND DECISIVELY BY ULTIMATE AUTHORITY IF ISSUES ARISE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS THE CREATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A DEPARTMENT IN A BUSINESS SHOULD MEAN THAT THE AVENUES OF COM MUNICATION BETWEEN THOSE IN THE RANKS AND THOSE AT THE TOP WHICH TOO OFTEN HAVE BECOME CLOSED AS A BUSINESS HAS GROWN LARGE ARE TO70 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BE REOPENED IF THIS DOES NOT BECOME TRUE THE POTENTIALITY FOR GOOD IN SUCH WORK CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN PARTIALLY REALIZED IT IS A DUTY THAT DISTINCTLY BELONGS TO THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE TO CULTIVATE SYMPATHETIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE OPINIONS OF WORKERS AND TO BESPEAK THESE TO THE MANAGEMENT ALL INDUSTRY IS SO SET UP THAT THE WORD OF THE MANAGEMENT CAN BE QUICKLY AND EASILY TRANSMITTED DOWN IT IS NO LESS OF CONSEQUENCE TO THOSE ABOVE THAN TO THOSE BELOW THAT SOME AGENCY EXISTS FOR FACILITATING THE REVERSE PROCESS INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO DEFINITELY ADVANCED AS IT HAS BEEN WITHOUT GIGANTIC ACCOMPLISHMENT IN GATHERING DATA CODIFYING THEM AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SYSTEMS TO REALIZE BENEFITS FROM THE LESSONS LEARNED IT IS USELESS TO EXPECT THAT GREAT BUSINESSES CAN BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A GREAT MASS OF PRESCRIBED ROUTINES DESIGNED FOR THE GREATEST GOOD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BUT IT IS TRUE THAT THE NECESSARY STRUGGLE FOR UNIFORMITY AND SYSTEM HAS INVOLVED THE LIMITATION OF INDIVIDUALISM TO STANDARDIZED TYPES TO AN EXTENT THAT RAISES SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SET LIMITS TO THE ADVANTAGES WHICH MAY ACCRUE TO A BUSINESS FROM SUCH ATTRIBUTES OF PERSONALITY AMONG ITS MEN AS LOYALTY AND ENTHUSIASM AND YET PERSONALITY CANNOT WELL BE STANDARDIZED HEREIN THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT NEEDS PARTICU LARLY TO BE ON GUARD IN ITS OWN WORK IT MUST STEER BETWEEN THE DANGER OF FOLLOWING THE FOREMANS METHOD OF PICKING MEN BECAUSE HE LIKES THEIR LOOKS OR THEIR MANNERS AND A METHOD SO SYSTEMATIZED AND IMPERSONAL AS TO HAVE ELIMINATED ALL INDIVIDUALISM IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT GREAT CAUTION IS NEEDED TO AVOID BLIND ACCEPTANCE OF METHODS FROM AMONG THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS EVOLVED BY THE LESS CAREFUL INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGISTS OR ADVOCATES OF CHARACTER ANALYSIS MUCH ALONG THESE LINES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WHICH OUGHT TO BE KNOWN AND UTILIZED TO REASONABLE EXTENT IN THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE IT IS SURELY TRUE THAT CERTAIN PHYSICAL TYPES ARE PARTICULARLY ADAPTED TO CERTAIN FORMS OF MANUAL LABOR IT IS AS TRUE THAT CERTAIN MENTAL TYPES HAVE ESPECIAL APTITUDES WHICH OUGHT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ASSIGNING THEM TO WORK EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY HAS TAUGHT US HOW TO DETERMINE THE MENTAL DEFECTIVE AND THE MORON AND IS CAPABLE OF DOING FAR MORE FOR US BUT THERE IS A REFINEMENT OF SYSTEM PROPOSED BY SOME THAT IS NEITHER COMMERCIALLY PROFITABLE NOR ETHICALLY SOUND IN THAT ON THE ONE HAND AT LARGE EXPENSE IT ATTEMPTSTHE FUNTIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT 71 THE STANDARDIZATION OF PERSONALITY AND ON THE OTHER IT ACCEPTS UN DULY A THEORY OF PREDESTINATION WHICH WOULD LARGELY LIMIT THE OPPOR TUNITIES FOR PROVING INDIVIDUAL WORTH THERE ARE HOWEVER NO DIFFERENCES OF OPINION CONCERNING THE DESIRABILITY OF STANDARDIZATION OF JOBS THIS IS NOT PROPERLY A RESPON SIBILITY OF THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE BUT KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE RE SPECTIVE STANDARDS ARE IS ONE OF ITS VITAL NEEDS IF THE DATA HAVE NOT BEEN GATHERED AND MADE AVAILABLE ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL MOVES FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ITS OWN WORK IS TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A SURVEY OF REQUIREMENTS OF THE WORK AND OPPOR TUNITIES FOR THE WORKERS IN THE RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND SUBDE PARTMENTS AS BROUGHT TOGETHER WILL GIVE A COMPOSITE OF THE WHOLE PLANT SUCH A SURVEY NEED NOT BE MADE OBTRUSIVELY NOR NEED IT BECOME A NUISANCE TO DEPARTMENT EXECUTIVES IT WILL NECESSARILY INVOLVE THE EXPENDITURE OF CONSIDERABLE TIME BUT IT IS WORTH WHILE DOING EVEN IF IT HAS TO BE DONE VERY QUIETLY AND VERY SLOWLY FOR WHILE IT OFFERS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL DATA FOR EMPLOYMENT WORK IT LIKEWISE OFTEN SHOWS SUCH INCONSISTENCIES IN PRACTICE THAT A COM PANY CAN MARKEDLY RAISE ITS AVERAGE OF EFFICIENCY IF ONLY IT BRINGS THE DEPARTMENTS OF LAX OR FAULTY STANDARDS SOMEWHAT UP TOWARDS THE GRADES OF THOSE WHICH ARE BEING WELL ADMINISTERED SUCH A SURVEY IN ITS ELEMENTARY FORM SHOULD SHOW AT LEAST SUCH FACTS CONCERNING THE RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS AS PREFERRED SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR NEW EMPLOYES EDUCATION OR SPECIAL TRAINING REQUIRED ANY SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES DESIRED INITIAL WAGES PAID OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT IN POSITION AND POSSIBLE WAGE INCREASES WORKING CONDITIONS AND WORKING HOURS AND LABOR TURNOVER THE TERM LABOR TURNOVER WHICH HAS RECENTLY COME INTO GEN ERAL USE EVEN NOW IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY SOME AND IS PERHAPS BEST DESCRIBED BY THE MORE BRUTAL PHRASE IN GENERAL USE HIRING AND FIRING THE ANNUAL HIRING AND FIRING FIGURES REPRESENT THE PER CENTAGE OF LABOR TURNOVER FOR INSTANCE IF A COMPANY MAINTAINS A NORMAL LABOR FORCE OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND IS OBLIGED TO EMPLOY ANNUALLY A THOUSAND TO COMPENSATE FOR THOSE WHO LEAVE OR ARE DIS MISSED THE LABOR TURNOVER IS 100 PER CENT PROBABLY NO GREATER ARGUMENT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FUNC TIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT IN MANY COMPANIES COULD BE MADE THAN TO INDUCE A STUDY OF THE LABOR TURNOVER FIGURES IT IS NOT AN UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE TO FIND EMPLOYERS WHO ESTIMATE THE72 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FIGURES OF THEIR OWN CONCERNS AT LESS THAN 50 PER CENT WHEN IT ACTUALLY RUNS TO SEVERAL TIMES THAT FIGURE IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT SUCH FIGURES THOUGH ILLUMINATING IN THEM SELVES NEED FURTHER ANALYSIS TO BE OF MAJOR USE FOR INSTANCE SEASONAL DEMANDS MAY BE SUCH IN THE SPECIFIED SHOP NORMALLY ENROLLING A THOUSAND HANDS THAT TWO HUNDRED MUST BE EMPLOYED PERIODICALLY FOR A FEW WEEKS AND THEN DISMISSED THEIR PLACES AGAIN TO BE FILLED IN A FEW MORE WEEKS IF THIS HAPPENS FIVE TIMES A YEAR THE TURNOVER FIGURES WILL BE 100 PER CENT THE OTHER EXTREME WOULD BE A CONCERN WITH SUCH LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE MONEY LOSS INVOLVED IN CHANGE THAT PRACTICALLY EVERY JOB WAS VACATED AND FILLED AT LEAST ANNUALLY WHEN LIKEWISE THE LABOR TURNOVER WOULD BE 100 PER CENT SUCH FIGURES ARE MUCH TOO HIGH BUT THEY ARE NOT INFRE QUENT THEY LIKEWISE ARE EXPENSIVE BUT WHILE IN THE LATTER CASE THE CONCERN IN QUESTION WOULD BEAR MUCH OF THE EXPENSE IN THE FORMER IT IS MORE LARGELY IMPOSED UPON THE COMMUNITY WORKING MEN OR WORKING WOMEN WHO THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN ARE DEPRIVED SUCCESSIVELY TIME ON TIME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES TO REALIZE THEIR EARNING CAPACITIES INEVITABLY SUFFER IMPAIRMENT OF COURAGE SELF RESPECT AND EVEN MORAL FIBRE THE LOSS OF WHICH FALLS FIRST UPON THE COMMUNITY BUT EVENTUALLY UPON INDUSTRY IN THE DEPRECIATION IN QUALITY AND SPIRIT OF THE LABOR SUPPLY IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE TO REMOVE THE SEASONAL ELEMENT IN EMPLOYMENT NEEDS IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES ON THE OTHER HAND MUCH WOULD BE GAINED IF BY ANALYSIS AND COM PARISON FOREMEN AND SUBMANAGERS COULD BE SHOWN THE FUTILITY AND FINANCIAL LOSS OF THE LACK OF COMPREHENSION WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO DISCHARGE CARELESSLY ON CAPRICE OR FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT PERVERTED SENSE OF DISCIPLINE WHICH THEY PHRASE AS KEEPING THE FEAR OF GOD IN THE HEARTS OF THEIR PEOPLE  THERE IS SO MUCH ADVANTAGE IN HAVING EMPLOYES WHO KNOW THE WAYS AND ROUTINES OF A CONCERN THAT IT WOULD SEEM THAT EXCEPT WHERE DISMISSALS ARE FOR SUFFICIENT CAUSE THOSE SUFFERING THEM WOULD BE PREFERRED APPLICANTS FOR POSITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY CALL ING FOR LIKE GRADE OF ABILITY IT IS NOT OFTEN SO NEVERTHELESS EXCEPT WHERE A WELLESTABLISHED EMPLOYMENT OFFICE OR ITS EQUIVALENT EXISTS ALL TOO FREQUENTLY A REDUCTION OF WORK IN ONE DEPARTMENT OF A LARGE MANUFACTURING PLANT WILL SEND WORKERS OUT UNDER DISMISSAL WHILE SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT OF THE SAME PLANT IS SEEKING ADDITIONAL HELPTHE FUINTIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT 73 A RULE WHICH HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SOME LARGE PLANTS AND WHICH HAS WORKED ADVANTAGEOUSLY IS THAT NO DEPARTMENT CAN DIS CHARGE AN INDIVIDUAL FROM THE COMPANYS EMPLOY IT CAN ONLY DIS MISS FROM ITS OWN WORK IN EFFECT THIS SUBJECTS THE CASE TO REVIEW OF SOME HIGHER OFFICIAL WHO HOLDS THE POWER OF FINAL DISCHARGE GIVES THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE A CHANCE TO UTILIZE THE EXPERIENCED EMPLOYE ELSEWHERE IF OF PROVED CAPACITY AND ACTS AS A HEALTHY CHECK ON THE IMPULSIVE HIGHHANDEDNESS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF FOREMEN AND SUB MANAGERS ANOTHER RULE WHICH WORKS TO SOMEWHAT THE SAME EFFECT IS TO REQUIRE ADVANCE NOTICES TO BE FILED WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE CONCERNING PROJECTED DISMISSALS TOGETHER WITH THE REASONS THEREFOR OTHER STATISTICS WHICH WILL INTEREST THE PROGRESSIVE EMPLOYER MAY BE COMPILED SHOWING THE DEGREE OF PERMANENCY OF THE LABOR FORCETHUS THE PERCENTAGES SHOWING WHAT PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN EMPLOYED LESS THAN A YEAR WHAT PROPORTION FOR BETWEEN ONE AND TWO YEARS AND SO ON NOT INFREQUENTLY IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THESE FIGURES REVEAL EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS QUITE APART FROM THE THEORIES OF THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE AND CONTRARY TO HIS BELIEF AS TO HOW HIS BUSINESS IS BEING RUN A MANUFACTURER EMPLOYING ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MEN TOLD ME RECENTLY THAT HE HAD GENUINELY BELIEVED THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS MEN HAD BEEN WITH HIM FROM TEN TO TWENTY YEARS ONLY TO FIND FROM SUCH A STATISTICAL TABLE THAT 50 PER CENT HAD BEEN THERE LESS THAN TWO AND A HALF YEARS INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE SUGGESTED THAT SOME OF THE EASY GENERALI ZATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN REGARD TO THE LACK OF STABILITY OF WORKINGMEN AS GROUPS BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE THEREIN OF SOCALLED FLOATERS WOULD BE MATERIALLY ALTERED IF IT COULD BE KNOWN TO WHAT EXTENT IT HAD BEEN BEYOND THE VOLITION OF WORKMEN OF UNQUESTIONED SKILL TO REMAIN PERMANENTLY PLACED IN GENERAL THE HANDLING OF DISMISSALS HAS BEEN DICTATED BY THE INTELLI GENCE OF SUBEXECUTIVES RATHER THAN BY THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE MAN AGEMENT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO SUPERVISION FROM ABOVE THE FUNCTIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT IS DEPENDENT FOR SUCCESSFUL ACCOMPLISHMENT IN PARTICULARLY SPECIFIC WAYS UPON THE SMOOTHNESS WITH WHICH ITS WORK CAN BE MADE TO ARTICULATE WITH OTHER FUNCTIONALIZED DEPARTMENTS SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT THE SCHEDULE OR ROUTING DEPARTMENT AND OTHER LIKE ONES IT MUST RELY ON THESE FOR THE DATA TO PROVE MUCH OF ITS OWN74 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WORK AND IN TURN IT MAY FIND WITHIN ITS PERSPECTIVE FACTS HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO THEM THROUGH THE LARGE NUMBER OF ITS INTERVIEWS IT SHOULD COME TO HAVE AN UNUSUALLY COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT RATES OF WAGES FOR ESTABLISHED GRADES OF WORK IT OUGHT FURTHERMORE TO COME INTO POSITION TO KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT THE LAW OF INCREASING RETURNS WILL APPLY TO ADDITIONAL RATES OF PAY ESTABLISHED TO SECURE SUPERIOR ABILITY IT IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ATTENTION OF INDUSTRIAL LEADERS HAS BEEN FIXED IN THE PAST SO INTENTLY ON PROBLEMS OF POWER PLANTS AND MACHINES THAT SO LITTLE PRACTICAL RECOGNITION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE FACT THAT THE MOST EFFICIENT WORKER EVEN AT CONSIDERABLY INCREASED COST IS FAR AND AWAY THE MOST PROFITABLE THE MOST OBVIOUS DEMONSTRATION OF THIS EXISTS PERHAPS IN THE CASE OF A SHOP FILLED WITH EXPENSIVE MACHINERY WORKING TO FULL CAPACITY YET WITH ITS PRODUCTION FALLING BEHIND ITS ORDERS WOULD THERE BE ANY HESI TANCY IF ITS MANAGEMENT COULD HAVE AN OPTION OFFERED BETWEEN ADDED EFFICIENCY AND ENTHUSIASM AMONG ITS EMPLOYES THAT WOULD INCREASE ITS POTENTIALITY A HALF THROUGH THE ENROLLMENT OF ITS LABOR FORCE ON THE BASIS OF CAPABILITY TO EARN A LARGELY INCREASED WAGE AND THE ALTERNATIVE OF THE NECESSITY OF ADDING 50 PER CENT TO ITS PLANT AND MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT THE TRUTH IS THAT SEEMINGLY THERE IS NOT YET ANY GENERAL UNDERSTANDING AMONG EMPLOYERS THAT A HIGH GROSS PAYROLL DOES NOT NECESSARILY RESULT FROM A HIGH INDIVIDUAL WAGE OR EXPRESSED IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TERMS THAT THE COST PER UNIT OF PRO DUCTION MAY BE LARGER THE LOWER THE RATE OF PAY TO THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER A SOMEWHAT ANALAGOUS PRINCIPLE IS INVOLVED IN THE MATTER OF WORKING HOURS PER DAY THE OLDTIME PRACTICE INDICATED A THEORY THAT IF SO MUCH WORK COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BY A WORKINGWEEK OF SIXTY HOURS 20 PER CENT MORE COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A WORKING WEEK OF SEVENTYTWO HOURS REDUCE THESE FIGURES TO FIFTY HOURS A WEEK AS COMPARED TO SIXTY AND THE THEORY DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SO COMPLETELY DISCARDED EVEN NOW YET THE FACTS ARE AVAILABLE  FROM MODERN INVESTIGATIONS OF THE PHYSICAL AND NERVOUS REACTIONS FROM FATIGUE LACK OF VARIETY INCIDENT TO REFINEMENTS OF METHODS IN SPECIALIZATION AND WANT OF TIME FOR RECUPERATIVE PROCESSES TO SHOW THAT UP TO SOME DEFINITE LIMIT ACTUAL GROSS PRODUCTION MAY INCREASE UNDER REDUCTION OF HOURS OR THAT UP TO SOME OTHER LIMIT A MUCH LARGER PROPORTIONATE PRODUCTION PER HOUR OF WORK MAY BE SECUREDTHE FUNTIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT 75 MOREOVER THESE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN PROVED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE ACTUAL OPERATIONS OF PROGRESSIVE COMPANIES IT IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE OR SHOULD HAVE FINAL AUTHORITY TO GOVERN THESE POLICIES BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS IN A POSITION TO STUDY AND COMPILE DATA REGARD ING THESE PROBLEMS AS VERY FEW OTHER DEPARTMENTS CAN AND EITHER IN INITIATING OR CONTRIBUTING TO INVESTIGATIONS OF ALL SUCH MATTERS AFFECTING THE HUMAN RELATIONS IT HAS OPPORTUNITY FOR RENDERING THE MOST VALUABLE KIND OF STAFF SERVICE TO THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATION AND TO DEPARTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITSELF INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY WITH ALL ITS VITAL IMPORTANCE IS YET A MEANS TO AN END AND NOT THE END ITSELF IT IS THE QUALITY OR MANNER BY WHICH A HIGHLY DESIRABLE RESULT IS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BUT IT IS NOT THE RESULT IT HAS TOO OFTEN HAPPENED THAT AN EARNEST ADVOCATE OF EFFICIENT METHODS HAS BECOME SO ENGROSSED IN THE TECHNIQUE OF HIS PROFESSION AS TO IGNORE ITS PURPOSE TO THE CONSEQUENT DETRIMENT OF THE GENERAL CAUSE SO IT MAY BE TOO EASILY WITH FUNCTIONALIZED EMPLOYMENT WORK AN OFFICE MAY BE SET UP UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A MASTER OF SYSTEM WHICH IN ITS OPERATION SHALL BE A MODEL OF METHOD INTERVIEWING OF APPLICANTS FILLING OUT OF SKILLFULLY DEVISED APPLICATION BLANKS AND FIL ING THEM AND CREATION OF NUMBERLESS CARD RECORDS MAY BE SO CON DUCTED AS TO SHOW THESE THINGS TO HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO AN EXACT SCIENCE AND YET THE VALUE OF THE DEPARTMENT REMAIN PROB LEMATICAL OF COURSE NO EFFORT MUST BE SPARED TO HAVE THE WAYS DEVISED BY WHICH THE BEST POSSIBLE CANDIDATES SHALL BE OFFERED AND CHOSEN FOR THE RESPECTIVE KINDS OF WORK BUT THE WORK IS INCOMPLETE IF IT STOPS HERE THE GOOD OF THE BUSINESS IS THE CRITERION BY WHICH ALL ACCOM PLISHMENT MUST BE JUDGED IF A HIGH GRADE OF LABOR HAS BEEN SECURED THE COMPANYS INTERESTS DEMAND THAT THE ENVIRONMENT THE CONDI TIONS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES SHALL BE MADE SUCH AS TO HOLD IT THE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT CANNOT OMIT ANY LEGITIMATE EFFORT TO INFLUENCE POLICIES TO THIS END IT MUST WORK HELPFULLY AND UNDER STANDINGLY WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT PRIDE OR ARROGANCE BUT IT MUST WORK UNCEASINGLY WITH CLEAR VISION TOWARD THE GOAL OF MAKING ITS DISTINCT CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMPANYS PROSPERITY THROUGH THE IMPROVED HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS WHICH IT MAY HELP TO DEVELOP

THAT THIS COURSE WAS FORCED UPON HIM IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THE UNWARRANTED ABUSE HEAPED UPON HIMSELF AND WIFE BY HIS AUNT THAT HE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO CONCILIATE HER AND RETURN BUT THAT SHE FORBADE HIS RETURN TO HER PREMISES THE DECREE APPEALED FROM OVERRULED THE DEMURRER AND HELD IN AC CORDANCE WITH THE FINDING OF THE COMMISSIONER TO WHOM THE CAUSE WAS REFERRED THAT THE DEED IN QUESTION CONVEYED AN ESTATE ON CONDITIONS SUBSEQUENT THAT THOSE CONDITIONS HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE DEFENDANT LOWMAN AND THAT THE OMPLAINANT WAS ENTITLED TO HAVE SAID DEED CANCELLED AND DECLARED TO BE NULL AND VOID WHILE WE AGREE IN THE RESULT OF THIS DECREE WE CANNOT CONCUR IN THE REASONS WHICH LED THE COURT TO ITS CONCLUSION IT IS WELL SETTLED THAT CONDITIONS SUBSEQUENT ARE NOT FAVORED IN LAW BECAUSE THEY TEND TO DESTROY ESTATES WHEN RELIED UPON TO WORK A FORFEITURE THEY MUST BE CREATED BY EXPRESS TERMS OR CLEAR IMPLICATION THE COURTS WILL NOT CONSTRUE AN ESTATE TO BE UPON CONDITION IF THE LANGUAGE OF THE DEED WILL ADMIT OF ANY OTHER REASONABLE INTERPRETATION THUS A DEED MADE IN CONSIDERATION OF A SUM OF MONEY AND THE PER FORMANCE OF CERTAIN AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN AN INDENTURE ANNEXED TO THE DEED PROVIDING FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE GRANTOR AND HIS WIFE IS NOT A DEED UPON CONDITION SUBSEQUENT DELVIN ON DEEDS SEC 978 CITING AYER EMERY 14 ALLEN 67 THERE ARE NO WORDS IN THE DEED UNDER CONSIDERATION CREATING A CON DITION SUBSEQUENT AND NOTHING TO SUGGEST THAT SUCH A CONDITION WAS CONTEMPLATED BY THE PARTIES NOR IS THERE ANY CLAUSE PROVIDING FOR A REENTRY BY THE GRANTOR THE PROVISION IN THE DEED THAT JOHN H LOWMAN SHOULD REMAIN WITH HIS AUNT AND TAKE CARE OF HER IN SICKNESS ANID IN HEALTH SO LONG AS SHE LIVED WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A COVENANT ON HIS PART THAT HE WOULD REN DER THOSE SERVICES IN CONSIDERATION FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF THE LAND TO HIM IT WAS A VALUABLE CONSIDERATION AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE DEED AND THE RELEASE FROM ANXIETY AS TO HER CARE AND COMFORT THEREBY HELD OUT

AFFORD THE RELIEF PRAVED FOR IS BROUGHT IN QUESTION BY THE DEMURRER WHICH WAS OVERRULED BY THE DECREE APPEALED FROM THE JURISDICTION OF A COURT OF EQUITY TO GRANT THE RELIEF ASKED FOR IS ALWAYS EXERCISED WHEN THE REMEDY AT LAW IS INADEQUATE POM EQ VOL 3 SEC 1377 POWNAL V TAYLOR SUZPRA WAMPLER V WAMPLER SUPRA THE FACTS IN THE CASE LAST CITED ARE VERV SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE CASE AT BAR IN DEALING WITH THE DEMURRER IN THAT CASE THE COURT SAID  IT IS PLAIN THAT THE PLAINTIFF DID INOT HAVE A COMPLETE AND ADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE DEED OF CONVEYANCE FOR THE LAND AS ALLEGED IN THE BILL WAS THE COMFORTABLE SUPPORT OF THE GRANTOR AND HIS WIFE DURING THEIR LIVES AND THE ERECTION ON THE LAND CONVEYED OF A GOOD AND COMFORTABLE HOUSE THIS WAS A CONTINUING OBLIGATION ON THE PART OF THE GRANTEE IT WAS TO COINTINUE DURING THE LIVES OF THE GRANTORS ANID EACH OF THEM AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR OR SOONER THE GRANTORS HAD THE RIGHT OF ACTION IF THE COVENANT FOR SUPPORT WAS NOT COMPLIED WITH FOR A BREACH OF THE COVENANT IN SUCH ACTIOIN DAMAGES COULD BE RECOVERED ONLY FOR THE REFUSAL OF THE GRANTEE TO PER FORM HIS COVENANT UP TO THE TIME OF THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SUIT BUT THE OBLIGATION FOR SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE CONTINUED FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME DURING THE LIVES OF THE GRANTORS AND EACH OF THEM IT MAY BE FOR TEN OR TWENTY YEARS MUST THE GRANTORS BRING THEIR SUIT EVERY SIX MONTHS OR TWELVE MONTHS FOR A FAILURE UPON THE PART OF THE GRANTEE TO SUPPLY THEM WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND IN THE MEANTIME HAVING CONVEYED THEIR ALL TO THE GRANTEE HAVING DEPRIVED THEMSELVES OF THE NEANS OF SUPPORT MUST THEY SUFFER AND STARVE UNTIL BY SUITS AT LAW AND EXECUTIONIS THEY COULD COMPEL THE GRANTEE TO SUPPLY THEM WITH THE MEANS OF SUPPORT     WE THINK IT CLEAR THAT THE GRANTORS IN THIS CASE DID NOT HAVE A COMPLETE AND ADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW AND THAT UPON THE FACTS STATED IN THE RECORD ADMITTED BY THE DEMUIRRER TO BE TRUE A COURT OF EQUITY HAD THE UNDOUBTED JURISDICTION THERE BEING NO COMPLETE AND ADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW IF NOT TO COMPEL A SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT ON THE PART OF THE GRANTEE CERTAINLY TO RESCIND THE CONTRACT ANNUL AND SET ASIDE THE DEED AND PUT THE PARTIES IN THE SAME POSITION THEY WERE IN BEFORE THE CONTRACT WAS MADE AND THE DEED DELIVERED THE COURT SUBSEQUENTLY ADVERTED TO THE ALLEGATION OF FRAUD AS AN1901 LOWMAN V CRAWFORD 555 ADDITIONAL GROUND FOR EQUITY JURISDICTION BUT RESTED ITS CONCLUSION ON THE DISTINCT GROUND THAT THE REMEDY WAS INADEQUATE AT LAW IN THE CASE AT BAR TAKING THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE BILL TO BE TRUE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE REMEDY AT LAW WOULD BE WHOLLY INADEQUATE AND HENCE A COURT OF EQUITY HAS JURISDICTION AND WILL ANIIUL THE DEED AND PUT THE PARTIES IN THE SAME POSITION THEY WERE IN BEFORE IT WAS MADE IF THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE BILL ARE SUSTAINED BY THE PROOF THE ESSENTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR THE CONVEYANCE WAS THE UNDERTAKING ON THE PART OF THE GRANTEE TO LIVE WITH HIS AUNT AND TAKE CARE OF HER IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH AS LONG AS SHE LIVED IT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT THE GRANTEE HAS ABANDONED THE HOUSE OF THE GRANTOR AND NO LONGER CONTRIBUTES ANYTHING TO HER CARE OR COMFORT IN EITHER SICKNESS OR HEALTH LOWMAN CONTENDS THAT HE WAS PREVENTED FROM PERFORMING THIS COVENANT BY THE COMPLAINANT THIS EXCUSE FOR HIS FAILURE TO PERFORM THE CONTRACT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY SUSTAINED BY THE EVIDENCE TROUBLE AP APPEARS TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE ADVENT OF LOWMANS WIFE INTO THE HOUSE IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SATISFACTORILY APPEAR THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS DISSATISFACTION RESTED WITH THE COMPLAINANT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COMPLAINANT MADE THE CONVEYANCE IN QUESTION IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT SECURE A MAN WHO WOULD TAKE FROM HER SHOULDERS THE RESPONSIBILITY AND CARE OF BUSINESS PROVIDE FOR HER PERSONAL SAFETY IN HER ADVANCING YEARS AND BE A SUPPORT AND COMFORT TO HER IN SICKNESS AS WELL AS IN HEALTH OF ALL THIS COMPLAINANT HAS BEEN DEPRIVED BY THE ACT OF THE GRANTEE IN LEAVING HER HOME AND ABANDONING THE OBLI GATIONS IMPOSED UPON HIM BY HIS CONTRACT UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE DEED IN QUESTION SHOULD BE SET ASIDE AND DECLARED TO BE NULL AND VOID AND THE PARTIES PLACED IN STATU QUO THIS HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY THE DECREE APPEALED FROM AND IT IS AFFIRMED AFFIRMED NOTE THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT THAT SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE WAS REACHED IN THIS CASE THE DEED HAVING BEEN MADE IN CONSIDERATION OF THE SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AND THE GRANTEE HAVING FAILED AND REFUSED TO PROVIDE SUCH MAINTENANCE JUSTICE WOULD SEEM TO DEMAND THAT THE GRANTOR SHOULD HAVE THE LAND BACK BUT WE HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN FINDING ANY CLEAR PRINCIPLE OF EQUITY JURISPRUDENCE JUSTIFYING RESCISSION IN SUCH CASE THE REASONING OF THE COURT CLEARLY JUSTIFIES EQUITABLE INTER FERENCE AND EQUITABLE RELIEF OF SOME SORTFOR EXAMPLE SEQUESTRATION OF THE RENTS AND PROFITS WHICH SO FAR AS APPEARS MAY HAVE BEEN LARGELY IN EXCESS OF THE SER VICES WHICH THE GRANTEE COVENANTED TO PERFORM WHERE A CONTRACT IS EXECUTORY ON BOTH SIDES EQUITY FREQUENTLY EXERCISES THE JURISDICTION TO RESCIND FOR REFUSAL OF ONE PARTY TOPERFORM BUT WHERE IT IS WHOLLY EXECUTED ON ONE SIDE AND THERE IS NO FRAUD MISTAKE OR OTHER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCE PRESENT RESCISSION IS NOT THE USUAL REMEDY IF FOR EXAMPLE THE GRANTEE IN THE556 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC PRINCIPAL CASE HAD COVENANTED TO PAY A SUM OF MONEY IN GROSS OR IN INSTALLMENTS AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE CONVEYANCE THE NEGLECT OR REFUSAL TO PAY ON THE PART OF THE GRANTEE WOULD NOT HAVE ENTITLED THE GRANTOR TO RESCIND THE DECISION IS FULLY SUSTAINED HOWEVER BY THAT IN WAMPLER V WAMPLER 30 GRATT 454 CITED IN ITS SUPPORT THOUGH IN THAT CASE THE DECISION WAS BASED ON TLLE ADDITIONAL GROUND OF FRAUD ON THE PART OF THE GRANTEE BUT NEITHER IN THIS NOR THE PRINCIPAL CASE DOES THE COURT UNDERTAKE TO STATE DISTINCTLY THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH RESCISSION IS JUSTIFIED IN THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION IS NOT GENERALLY A GROUND OF RESCISSIONTHAT IS WHERE THE FAILURE CONSISTS MERELY IN THE NONPERFORMANCE OF THE COVENANTS OF THE GRANTEE IF ONE SELLS A HORSE FOR A CER TAIN PRICE ON CREDIT OR FOR SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED HE CANNOT RESCIND AND CLAIM THE HORSE BECAUSE OF NONPAYMENT OF THE PRICE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES ON A SALE OF REAL ESTATE THE RULING OF THE COURT MAY DOUBTLESS BE JUSTIFIED ON THE GROUND OF THE PECU LIAR CHARACTER OF THE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DOING COMPLETE JUSTICE IN CASES OF THIS SORT EXCEPT BY RESCISSION EVEN IF THERE BE NO WELL DEFINED PRINCIPLE AUTHORIZING RESCISSION IN SUCH A CASE WE ARE GLAD TO SEE THE PRINCIPLE NOW FIRMLY ESTABLISHED THE CONCLUSION OF THE COURT THAT THERE WAS NO CONDITION SUBSEQUENT IN THE CASE SEEMS SOUND AND SUPPORTED BY THE CASE OF POWNAL V TAYLOR 10 LEIGH 172 LAWYERS WHO ARE CALLED UPON TO DRAW CONVEYANCES IN CONSIDERATION OF SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE WILL FIND A CAPITAL FORM IN THE REPORT OF THE CASE LAST CITED IN THE CONVEYANCE THERE UNDER REVIEW THE GRANTOR TOOK THE PRECAUTION WANTING IN THE DEED CONSTRUED IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE OF CHARGING THE GRANTEES COVENANTS FOR MAINTENANCE ETC UPON THE LAND ITSELF INTO WHOSESOEVER HANDS IT MIGHT COME TLLIS IS AN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT PRECAUTION IN VIRGINIA WHERE THERE IS NO VENDORS LIEN UNLESS RESERVED ON THE FACE OF THE CONVEYANCE IF IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THE GRANTEE HAD ALIENED OR MORTGAGED THE PREMISES BEFORE RESCISSION OR HAD A JUDG MENT BEEN ENTERED AGAINST HIM THE PROBABILITIES ARE THAT THE GRANTOR WOULD HAVE LOST RECOURSE AGAINST THE PROPERTY TO THE

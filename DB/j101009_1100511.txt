ANOTHER Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond November 21 1901 1 CONDITIONS SUBSEQUENTHOW createdHow construed Conditions subse quent are not favored in law because they tend to destroy estates Wheni relied upon to create a forfeiture they must be created by express terms or clear implication Language will not be held to create an estate upon condi tion if it will admit of any other reasonable interpretation 2 CHANCERY JURISDICTIoNAdequate remedyDeed in consideration of support Case in judgment If the consideration of a conveyance be the care and suip port of the grantor for life the covenant to support and maintain creates a continuing obligation on the part of the grantee for the breaclh of which the remedy at law is not complete and adequate Equity has jurisdiction to annul and set aside the conveyance and to put the parties in tlle position they occupied before the conveyance In the case in judgment the convey ance was not upon a condition subsequent and there was no clause of reentry but it was made in consideration of care and support and the evidence justi fied the setting aside of the deed and the reinstatement of the parties to their former positions Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Augusta county pro nounced June 11 1901 in a suit in chancery wherein the appellees were the complainants and the appellant was the defendant Affirmed The land in controversy in this suit is part of a larger tract which had been conveyed to a trustee in trust for the sole and separate use of Mrs Johnston one of the appellees The trustee never united in the deed to the appellant but Mrs Johnstons powers over her equita ble estate were those of absolute ownership The other facts suf ficiently appear in the opinion of the court Charles Curry and Hulst Glenn for the appellant Patrick  Gordon for the appellees HARRISON J delivered the opinion of the court By deed dated July 26 1898 Mary E Johnston conveyed to her nephew John H Lowman a tract of land in Augusta county upon which she resided containing 108 acres 2 roods and 23 poles together with certain personal property therein mentioned The con sideration for this conveyance expressed on the face of the deed is as  Reported by M P Barks State Reporter552 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec follows That for and in consideration of the love and affection the said Mary E Johnston has for the said John H Lowman his remain ing with her the said Mary E Johnston the taking care of her so long as she may live in sickness as well as in health the payment of all her just debts that may be unpaid at her decease and the further consideration of one dollar cash in hand paid the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged The deed contains the following clauses called exceptions Exception No 1 This deed is made to go upon record that the said Mary E Johnston may feel assured that her property will be disposed of as she wishes but possession shall not be relinquished by her the said Mary E Johnston during her life At her the said Mary E Johnstons decease the said John H Lowman shall have full and complete possession of the land hereby conveyed as well as all the personal property enumerated above  Exception No 2 In the event the said John H Lowman shall die before the said Mary E Johnston and not be able to comply with that part of the consideration above viz His remaining with her and taking care of her so long as she may live c she the said Mary E Johnston reserves the right to revoke this deed by making another deed But unless revoked by the said Mary E Johnston in a legal manner this deed shall remain in full force even though the said John H Lc vman die before the said Mary E Johnston The bill in this case which is filed by Mary E Johnston and her trustee after setting forth her title and the execution of the foregoing deed charges that the consideration that John H Lowman should remain with the complainant and take care of her so long as she may live in sickness as well as in health has wholly failed that said John H Lowman has long since deserted complainant and has failed and still utterly fails to take care of lher in either sickness or health and that the treatment of complainant by said John H Lowman warrants the revocation and cancellation of the deed and the restoration of com plainant to all of her rights as they existed prior to the execution of the same The defendant John H Lowman filed a demurrer and answer to the bill in which he alleges that prior to the execution of the deed in question he was living with his aunt the complainant as a farm hand with the understanding that she would pay him at the rate of 10 per month board him keep his horse and do his washing ironing and mending that after the execution of the deed he took full manageinent of everything with the understanding that he should have his living out of the farm as a member of the family so long as1901 LOWMAN V CRAWFORD 553 his aunt lived estimated at the rate of wages she was theretofore paying him that the deed was made without any inducement or solicitation on his part and accepted by him with the purpose ofliving up to its require ments That soon after the execution of the deed he married with his aunts approbation and consent and took his wife to live with him at his aunts house Respondent admits that he afterwards left his aunts home and employment but insists that this course was forced upon him in order to get rid of the unwarranted abuse heaped upon himself and wife by his aunt that he made every effort to conciliate her and return but that she forbade his return to her premises The decree appealed from overruled the demurrer and held in ac cordance with the finding of the commissioner to whom the cause was referred that the deed in question conveyed an estate on conditions subsequent that those conditions had been broken by the defendant Lowman and that the omplainant was entitled to have said deed cancelled and declared to be null and void While we agree in the result of this decree we cannot concur in the reasons which led the court to its conclusion It is well settled that conditions subsequent are not favored in law because they tend to destroy estates When relied upon to work a forfeiture they must be created by express terms or clear implication The courts will not construe an estate to be upon condition if the language of the deed will admit of any other reasonable interpretation Thus a deed made in consideration of a sum of money and the per formance of certain agreements contained in an indenture annexed to the deed providing for the support of the grantor and his wife is not a deed upon condition subsequent Delvin on Deeds sec 978 citing Ayer Emery 14 Allen 67 There are no words in the deed under consideration creating a con dition subsequent and nothing to suggest that such a condition was contemplated by the parties nor is there any clause providing for a reentry by the grantor The provision in the deed that John H Lowman should remain with his aunt and take care of her in sickness anid in health so long as she lived was nothing more than a covenant on his part that he would ren der those services in consideration for the conveyance of the land to him It was a valuable consideration amply sufficient to support the deed and the release from anxiety as to her care and comfort thereby held out constituted no doubt the chief inducement for making the554 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec deed Pownsal v Taylor 10 Leigh 179 Wampler v Wampler 30 Gratt 454 The jurisdiction of a court of equity to afford the relief praved for is brought in question by the demurrer which was overruled by the decree appealed from The jurisdiction of a court of equity to grant the relief asked for is always exercised when the remedy at law is inadequate Pom Eq Vol 3 sec 1377 Pownal v Taylor suzpra Wampler v Wampler supra The facts in the case last cited are verv similar to those in the case at bar In dealing with the demurrer in that case the court said  It is plain that the plaintiff did Inot have a complete and adequate remedy at law The consideration for the deed of conveyance for the land as alleged in the bill was the comfortable support of the grantor and his wife during their lives and the erection on the land conveyed of a good and comfortable house This was a continuing obligation on the part of the grantee It was to cointinue during the lives of the grantors anid each of them At the end of the first year or sooner the grantors had the right of action if the covenant for support was not complied with for a breach of the covenant In such actioin damages could be recovered only for the refusal of the grantee to per form his covenant up to the time of the commencement of the suit But the obligation for support and maintenance continued for an indefinite time during the lives of the grantors and each of them it may be for ten or twenty years Must the grantors bring their suit every six months or twelve months for a failure upon the part of the grantee to supply them with food and clothing And in the meantime having conveyed their all to the grantee having deprived themselves of the neans of support must they suffer and starve until by suits at law and executionis they could compel the grantee to supply them with the means of support     We think it clear that the grantors in this case did not have a complete and adequate remedy at law and that upon the facts stated in the record admitted by the demuirrer to be true a court of equity had the undoubted jurisdiction there being no complete and adequate remedy at law if not to compel a specific performance of the contract on the part of the grantee certainly to rescind the contract annul and set aside the deed and put the parties in the same position they were in before the contract was made and the deed delivered The court subsequently adverted to the allegation of fraud as an1901 LOWMAN V CRAWFORD 555 additional ground for equity jurisdiction but rested its conclusion on the distinct ground that the remedy was inadequate at law In the case at bar taking the allegations of the bill to be true it is clear that the remedy at law would be wholly inadequate and hence a court of equity has jurisdiction and will aniiul the deed and put the parties in the same position they were in before it was made if the allegations of the bill are sustained by the proof The essential consideration for the conveyance was the undertaking on the part of the grantee to live with his aunt and take care of her in sickness and in health as long as she lived It is an established fact that the grantee has abandoned the house of the grantor and no longer contributes anything to her care or comfort in either sickness or health Lowman contends that he was prevented from performing this covenant by the complainant This excuse for his failure to perform the contract is not sufficiently sustained by the evidence Trouble ap appears to have followed the advent of Lowmans wife into the house it does not however satisfactorily appear that the responsibility for this dissatisfaction rested with the complainant It is clear that the complainant made the conveyance in question in order that she might secure a man who would take from her shoulders the responsibility and care of business provide for her personal safety in her advancing years and be a support and comfort to her in sickness as well as in health Of all this complainant has been deprived by the act of the grantee in leaving her home and abandoning the obli gations imposed upon him by his contract Under these circumstances the deed in question should be set aside and declared to be null and void and the parties placed in statu quo This has been accomplished by the decree appealed from and it is affirmed Affirmed NOTE There is no doubt but that substantial justice was reached in this case The deed having been made in consideration of the support and maintenance and the grantee having failed and refused to provide such maintenance justice would seem to demand that the grantor should have the land back But we have some difficulty in finding any clear principle of equity jurisprudence justifying rescission in such case The reasoning of the court clearly justifies equitable inter ference and equitable relief of some sortfor example sequestration of the rents and profits which so far as appears may have been largely in excess of the ser vices which the grantee covenanted to perform Where a contract is executory on both sides equity frequently exercises the jurisdiction to rescind for refusal of one party toperform But where it is wholly executed on one side and there is no fraud mistake or other similar circumstance present rescission is not the usual remedy If for example the grantee in the556 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec principal case had covenanted to pay a sum of money in gross or in installments as consideration for the conveyance the neglect or refusal to pay on the part of the grantee would not have entitled the grantor to rescind The decision is fully sustained however by that in Wampler v Wampler 30 Gratt 454 cited in its support though in that case the decision was based on tlle additional ground of fraud on the part of the grantee But neither in this nor the principal case does the court undertake to state distinctly the principle upon which rescission is justified in the absence of fraud Failure of consideration is not generally a ground of rescissionthat is where the failure consists merely in the nonperformance of the covenants of the grantee If one sells a horse for a cer tain price on credit or for services to be performed he cannot rescind and claim the horse because of nonpayment of the price or nonperformance of the services The same principle applies on a sale of real estate The ruling of the court may doubtless be justified on the ground of the pecu liar character of the arrangement between the parties and the impossibility of doing complete justice in cases of this sort except by rescission Even if there be no well defined principle authorizing rescission in such a case we are glad to see the principle now firmly established The conclusion of the court that there was no condition subsequent in the case seems sound and supported by the case of Pownal v Taylor 10 Leigh 172 Lawyers who are called upon to draw conveyances in consideration of support and maintenance will find a capital form in the report of the case last cited In the conveyance there under review the grantor took the precaution wanting in the deed construed in the principal case of charging the grantees covenants for maintenance etc upon the land itself into whosesoever hands it might come Tllis is an especially important precaution in Virginia where there is no vendors lien unless reserved on the face of the conveyance If in the principal case the grantee had aliened or mortgaged the premises before rescission or had a judg ment been entered against him the probabilities are that the grantor would have lost recourse against the property to the extent of the alienation or charge Relief somewhat similar to that granted in the principal casethat is by recis sionis often afforded in connection with mining leases where the lessee fails to reasonably begin or to continue mining operations upon wnich the lesson is dependent for royalties See Cowan v Iron Co 83 Va 547 Coal Co v Hise 92 Va 238 See also Laurel Creek Coal etc Co v Browning Va 39 S E 156 3 Va Sup Ct Rep 370in which the performance of the covenants was a condition subsequent

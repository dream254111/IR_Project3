to certain readjustments in the fields assigned to the different persons preparing surveys of historical activities in the Mississippi valley and Canada the region covered by the present paper includes the states of Minnesota Iowa Missouri Kansas Nebraska South Dakota North Dakota Montana Wyoming and Colorado As was the case in the writers paper a year ago references to materials bearing indirectly on the history of the entire upper Mississippi valley have oftentimes been purposely omitted since such materials have been thoroughly covered in the paper by Mr Buck With a few exceptions the period cov ered is that from July 1 914 to October 1 1915 HISTORICAL AGENCIES AND THEIR WORK On November 10 1914 Mr Solon J Buck was elected superin tendent and secretary of the Minnesota Historical Society to succeed Mr Warren Upham who for so many years occupied the position of secretary Mr Upham has taken up the work of archeologist for the society a line of research which he par ticularly enjoys As was noted in the REVIEW last year the sum of five hundred thousand dollars was appropriated for the erec tion of a building for the society Various difficulties arose which prevented the beginning of the work but by an act of the legislature approved on April 16 1915 all obstacles were re moved and it is now assured that building plans and operations will go forward without further delay Moreover the new legis lation makes provision for the care of the state archives in the new building while the supreme court hitherto included in the plans is eliminated A new line of activity on the part of the society is represented by a quarterly publication the Minnesota history bulletin the first number of which appeared in February 1915 No marked changes have been made in the organization sup port or work of the two state historical agencies in Iowa MrVol II No 3 Historical Activities 385 Frank E Horack and Mr Jacob Van der Zee who for many years have devoted part of their time to the positions of secre tary and research associate respectively in the State Historical Society of Iowa at Iowa City will hereafter give their entire time to the State University of Iowa although it is expected that they will still find opportunity to make occasional contributions to the publications of the society Miss Ethyl E Martin will assume many of the duties hitherto performed by Mr Horack and other changes in the official staff of the society have been made There have been some additions to the staff of the Historical Department of Iowa at Des Moines and appropriations were made by the general assembly of Iowa last winter to enable the department to encourage the marking and preservation of his toric sites According to another new law the custody of the public archives is now vested in the curator of the historical department instead of jointly in the state librarian and the curator as hitherto In Missouri which state was not included in the writers sur vey a year ago there are two state historical agencies namely the State Historical Society of AMissouri established in 1898 and located at Columbia and the Missouri Historical Society at St Louis organized in the year 1866 The first of these institutions receives its chief support from the state It maintains a library now numbering about one hundred and fifty thousand titles and an historical museum both of which have been housed in Aca demic hall of the University of Missouri At this writing how ever it is expected that the library and museum will soon be in stalled in the new fireproof library building of the university The principal publication of the society is the quarterly period ical known as the Missouri historical review Mr Francis A Sampson who has been secretary and librarian of the society since its organization and editor of the Review since its estab lishment in 1906 resigned from these positions in May of this year He has been succeeded by Mr Floyd C Shoemaker for merly assistant librarian Mr Sampson will hereafter devote his time to collecting historical material and compiling bibliog raphies for the society The Missouri Historical Society housed in the magnificent Jefferson Memorial building in St Louis is not maintained by386 Dan Elbert Clark M V H R state appropriations but is a private institution of which Mr Charles P Pettus is secretary It has a valuable library which is especially rich in manuscripts of the French and Spanish periods in Missouri and the Mississippi valley The publica tions issued somewhat irregularly by this society are the AMis souri Historical Society collections and a Bulletin devoted to archeology The Kansas State Historical Society located at Topeka was organized in 1875 On February 16 1914 Mr George W Mar tin who as secretary for many years was largely responsible for the growth of the society resigned his position on account of illness and he died on March 27 His successor in administer ing the work of the society is Mr William E Connelley whose historical writings are well known During the summer of 1914 the society moved into the new five hundred thousand dollar Me morial building which was dedicated on May 27 of that year The society has a large library and from time to time publishes volumes of Collections No changes have been made in the general scope of the work of the Nebraska State Historical Society but the last legislature slightly increased the biennial appropriation for the support of the society and provided in addition for the paying of the bill for printing the Proceedings out of the general printing fund  thus making a total increase of three thousand dollars in the biennial appropriation The work of the Department of History of South Dakota as was noted last time includes a larger range of activities than is usually undertaken by historical societies Consequently the department is affected by a special appropriation of three thou sand five hundred dollars for compiling the state census granted by the last legislature by a new law somewhat modifying the vital statistics act and by the addition of one thousand dollars annually to the support of the free library commission In North Dakota a general state budget plan has been adopted and hereafter all appropriations for the state historical society will be included in the state budget During the summer Mr Herbert C Fish resigned from the post of curator of the library and museum of the society located at Bismarck The name ofVol II No 3 Historical Activities 387 his successor if one has been chosen has not come to the knowl edge of the writer The reports fromn Montana Wyoming and Colorado indicate that the work in these states is almost entirely restricted to the building up of libraries and historical collections because of the lack of funds with which to issue publications or carry on other lines of activity The Wyoming Historical Society has received an increase of two hundred and fifty dollars biennially for reg ular support and better quarters will be provided for the soci etys library when an addition to the capitol building for which one hundred and fifty thousand dollars was appropriated by the last legislature is completed The State Historical and Natural History Society of Colorado of which Mr J C Smiley is secre tary is located in a handsome building in Denver but is lacking in funds with which to carry on any extensive historical work PUBLICATIONS OF HISTORICAL SOCIETIES Volume xv of the Collections of the Minnesota Historical Soci ety

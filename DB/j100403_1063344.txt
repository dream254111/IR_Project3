BONEDRY AMENDMENT TION BEFORE IT HAD LOST ITS INTERSTATE CHARACER I E WHILE IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE3 IN 1890 CONGRESS ENACTED THE WILSON ACT4 WHICH REMOVED THE DISABILITY OF THE STATES IN SO FAR AS THE SALE OR DISPOSAL WITH IN A STATE OF IMPORTED LIQUOR AFTER DELIVERY THEREIN WAS CON CERNED BUT DID NOT SO OPERATE AS TO PERMIT THE STATES TO PREVENT THE IMPORTATION OF LIQUOR AND ITS DELIVERY TO THE CONSIGNEE5 THE STATES WERE NOT YET IN A POSITION TO CONTROL THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC DESPITE THEIR POWER TO PREVENT SALE OR DISPOSAL EVEN IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE AFTER DELIVERY BECAUSE OF THEIR INABILITY TO PREVENT IMPORTATION AND DELIVERY TO THE CONSIGNEE TO MEET THIS SITUATION CONGRESS PASSED THE SOCALLED WEBBIENYON ACT6 WHICH PROHIBITS THE INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF INTOXICATING LIQ UOR WHEN IT IS INTENDED TO BE RECEIVED POSSESSED SOLD OR IN ANY MANNER USED IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW OF A STATE THIS ACT WHICH WAS UPHELD BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN JAMES CLARK DISTILLING CO V

THIS DECISION BY PROF LINDSAY ROGERS 4 VA LAW REV 558 635VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW THE PROVISION IS NOT HAPPILY EXPRESSED IT PENALIZES ANY ONE WHO SHALL ORDER PURCHASE OR CAUSE INTOXICATING LIQUORS TO BE TRANSPORTED IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE INTO ANY STATE ETC THE WORDS ORDER AND PURCHASE DO NOT FIT INTO THE GRAMMATICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE SENTENCE LET US HOWEVER PASS ON TO MORE SUBSTANTIAL DIFFICULTIES FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY AND CONVENIENCE IN THE SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSION LET US PARAPHRASE THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROVISION AND TREAT IT AS IF IT READ IT SHALL BE UNLAWFUL EXCEPT FOR SCIENTIFIC ETC PURPOSES TO IMPORT INTOXICATING LIQUORS INTO A STATE THE LAWS OF WHICH PROHIBIT THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO THE PROPER CONSTRUCTION OF THE ACT IN A CASE WHERE A STATE PROHIBITS THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR FOR BEVERAGE PURPOSES IN CERTAIN PLACES AND PERMITS IT IN OTHERS E G UNDER A LOCAL OPTION LAW WHERE PROHIBITION OR PERMIS SION DEPENDS UPON THE RESULT OF A LOCAL BALLOTING IN SUCH A CASE DOES THE FEDERAL ACT PERMIT THE IMPORTATION OF LIQUOR INTO THE DRY TERRITORY OF SUCH STATE THE PROHIBITION IS AGAINST TRANSPORTATION INTO ANY STATE THE LAWS OF WHICH FORBID SALE THEREIN THE OFFENSE DESCRIBED IS NOT THE IMPORTATION INTO A GIVEN PLACE IN THE STATE BUT THE IMPORTATION ACROSS THE LINE INTO THE STATE THE STATES TO WHICH THE PROVISION APPLIES ARE THOSE WHICH FORBID THE SALE THEREIN NEITHER THE LETTER NOR THE SPIRIT OF THE CLAUSE JUSTIFIES AN INTERPRETATION WHICH WOULD ALTO GETHER EXCLUDE INTOXICATING LIQUORS FROM A STATE WHICH FORBIDS THE MANUFACTURE OR SALE THEREOF ONLY AT SOME PLACE OR PLACES THEREIN SUCH AN INTERPRETATION WOULD EXCLUDE LIQUOR FROM A WET STATE IF IT SHOULD FOR EXAMPLE FORBID THE SALE OF LIQUOR WITHIN A CERTAIN DISTANCE OF A SCHOOL HOUSE THE ACT DEALS WITH ENTIRE STATES AND NOT WITH PARTS OF STATES UNLESS PROHIBITION OF SALE IS STATEWIDE THE ACT DOES NOT APPLY THE PROHIBITION IS AGAINST IMPORTING INTO CERTAIN STATES IN TOXICATING LIQUORS WHAT ARE INTOXICATING LIQUORS STATE STATUTES PROHIBITING THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS DEFINE THE TERM FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH STATUTES IN VARYING WAYS FRE QUENTLY IT IS PROVIDED THAT LIQUORS CONTAINING A GIVEN PERCENTAGE OF ALCOHOL SHALL BE DEEMED INTOXICATING LIQUORS AS THE PHRASE 636THE REED BONEDRY AMENDMENT IS NOT DEFINED IN THE REED AMENDMENT WHAT SHALL IT BE DEEMED TO INCLUDE A DEFINITE PERCENTAGE OF ALCOHOL CANNOT BE ADOPTED AS THE TEST FOR THE CAPACITY OF A LIQUOR TO PRODUCE INTOXICATION WILL DEPEND UPON THE NATURE OF OTHER INGREDIENTS8 IN THE AB SENCE OF STATUTORY DEFINITION THE QUESTION WHETHER A GIVEN FLUID IS INTOXICATING LIQUOR CAN ONLY BE ANSWERED BY DETERMIN ING WHETHER IT WILL PRODUCE INTOXICATION AND THAT IS A QUESTION OF FACT TO BE ASCERTAINED UPON EVIDENCE UNLESS THE LIQUID BE SUCH E G WHISKEY THAT THE COURT WILL TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE THAT IT IS INTOXICATING9 THE SAME TERM IS USED IN THE ACT IN ANOTHER PLACE THE STATES AS TO WHICH THE PROHIBITION IS APPLICABLE ARE THOSE WHICH PROHIBIT THE SALE FOR BEVERAGE LURPOSES OF INTOXICATING LIQ UORS DOES THE TERM MEAN THE SAME THING HERE AS WHEN FIRST USED HOW ARE WE TO DETERMINE WHICH ARE THE STATES WHICH PROHIBIT THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS SUPPOSE THAT A STATE SHOULD PROHIBIT THE SALE OF ABSINTHE AND PERMIT THE SALE OF ALL OTHER INTOXICATING LIQUORS IS SUCH A STATE ONE THAT PROHIBITS THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS FOR BEVERAGE PURPOSES TO SO CONSTRUE THE ACT WOULD NOT BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRESUMED INTENT OF CONGRESS SUCH A STATE WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A DRY OR PROHIBITION STATE REVERSE THE CASE AND SUPPOSE THAT THE STATE SHOULD PERMIT THE SALE OF ONE KIND OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS AND PROHIBIT THE SALE OF ALL OTHER KINDS WOULD THE RE SULT BE DIFFERENT TAKE THE LAW OF NORTH CAROLINA AS AN EX AMPLE A STATUTE OF THAT STATE 10 ALTOGETHER PROHIBITS THE MAN UFACTURE AND SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS EXCEPT THAT IT PERMITS THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF WINE IF

A STATE THE LAWS OF WHICH PROHIBIT THE MANUFACTURE OR SALE THEREIN OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR FOR BEVERAGE PURPOSES  THE ACT FORBIDS THE IMPORTATION OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS INTO STATES FALLING WITHIN A CERTAIN DESCRIPTION THE NATURAL MEAN ING OF THE LANGUAGE IS THAT IT PROHIBITS THE IMPORTATION OF ALL IN TOXICATING LIQUORS INTO SUCH STATES IS IT POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUE IT TO MEAN THAT IF A STATE PROHIBITS THE SALE OF ABSINTHE AND PER MITS THE SALE OF ALL OTHER INTOXICANTS THE FEDERAL ACT FORBIDS THE IMPORTATION OF ABSINTHE ONLYIN OTHER WORDS IS IT POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUE THE ACT AS PROHIBITING THE IMPORTATION OF SOME BUT NOT ALL INTOXICATING LIQUORS INTO A STATE THAT PROHIBITS THE SALE OF SUCH BUT NOT ALL INTOXICATING LIQUORS SUCH A CONSTRUC TION DOES VIOLENCE TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE PROVISION THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE NO JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERPRETING A PROHIBITION AGAINST THE IMPORTATION INTO CERTAIN DESCRIBED STATES OF INTOX ICATING LIQUORS AS PROHIBITING THE IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN KINDS ONLY OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS CLEARLY THE ACT DIVIDES THE STATES INTO TWO CLASSES 1 THOSE THAT PROHIBIT THE SALE OF INTOXICAT ING LIQUORS AND 2 THOSE THAT PERMIT IT NOR WILL THE LAN GUAGE OF THE PROVISION BEAR THE INTERPRETATION THAT THE IMPOR TATION OF ALL INTOXICATING LIQUOR INTO STATES FORBIDDING THE SALE OF SOME INTOXICATING LIQUOR IS FORBIDDEN THE PROHIBITION IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO STATES WHICH PROHIBIT THE SALE OF ALL INTOXI CATING LIQUORS IF A STATE BE NOT ENTIRELY DRY FROM A SALES STANDPOINT IT IS NOT RENDERED BONEDRY BY THE REED PROVISION THE ILLUSTRATION TAKEN FROM THE NORTH CAROLINA LAW IS ONE WHERE THE STATE PERMITS THE SALE OF LIQUOR WINE WHICH IS AD MITTEDLY INTOXICATING LIQUOR NOT ONLY IN FACT BUT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE STATE STATUTE FOR THE PURPOSE OF FURTHER ILLUSTRA TION LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE STATE STATUTE FORBIDS THE SALE OF AR DENT SPIRITS OR ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS AND DEFINES THE TERM USED AS LIQUORS CONTAINING SIX PER CENT OR MORE OF ALCOHOL LET US 1 NORTH CAROLINA WAS USED BY SENATOR REED AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE CLASS OF STATES INTO WHICH THE IMPORTATION OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR WAS TO BE FORBIDDEN BY HIS AMENDMENT CONGRESSIONAI RECORD 04TH CONGRESS 2ND SESSION P 3753 638THE REED BONEDRY AMENDMENT ALSO MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT LIQUOR CONTAINING FIVE PER CENT OR MORE OF ALCOHOL IS IN FACT INTOXICATING IN SUCH A CASE THE STATE DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE SALE OF ALL INTOXICATING LIQUOR SINCE IT PER MITS THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR CONTAINING FROM FIVE TO SIX PER CENT OF ALCOHOL IF THE VIEWS ABOVE SUGGESTED ARE CORRECT SUCH A STATE IS NOT ONE THE IMPORTATION OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR INTO WHICH IS FORBIDDEN BY THE REED PROVISION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE INTOXICATING LIQUOR SOUGHT TO BE INTRODUCED INTO THE STATE IS SUCH THAT ITS SALE IS FORBIDDEN BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT THE STATE STATUTE IN TERMS PROHIBITS THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS IBUT DEFINES THE TERM AS LIQUORS CONTAINING MORE THAN SIX PER CENT OF ALCOHOL LIQUOR CONTAIN ING FIVE PER CENT OR MORE OF ALCOHOL BEING STILL ASSUMED TO BE IN FACT INTOXICATING IS THE CASE DIFFERENT FROM THAT LAST ABOVE SUGGESTED  IS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE FEDERAL ACT TO DEPEND UP ON THE MERE QUESTION OF THE TERMS USED IN THE STATE STATUTE RE GARDLESS OF THE REAL CHARACTER OF THE THING PROHIBITED TO BE SOLD CAN IT BE CORRECTLY CONCLUDED THAT IF THE STATE STATUTE DOES NOT USE THE TERM INTOXICATING LIQUORS IN ITS PROHIBITION AGAINST SALE WE MUST ASCERTAIN WHETHER ALL LIQUORS WHICH ARE IN FACT IN TOXICATING ARE FORBIDDEN TO BE SOLD BUT THAT IF THE STATE STAT UTE IN TERMS FORBIDS THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS IT IS IM MATERIAL WHETHER IN FACT THE STATE HAS PROHIBITED THE SALE OF ALL LIQUORS ACTUALLY INTOXICATING CONSIDER THE REVERSE CASE TAKING AS AN ILLUSTRATION THE MAPP LAW OF VIRGINIA12 WHICH PROHIBITS THE MANUFACTURE SALE ETC OF ARDENT SPIRITS SECTION ONE PROVIDES THE WORDS ARDENT SPIRITS AS USED IN THIS ACT SHALL BE CON STRUED TO EMBRACE ALCOHOL BRANDY WHISKEY RUM GIN WINE PORTER ALE BEER ALL MALT LIQUORS ABSINTHE AND ALL COMPOUNDS OR MIXTURES OF ANY OF THEM ALL COMPOUNDS OR MIXTURES OF ANY OF THEM WITH ANY VEGETABLE OR OTHER SUB STANCE AND ALSO ALL LIQUIDS MIXTURES OR PREPARATIONS WHETHER PATENTED OR OTHERWISE WHICH WILL PRODUCE INTOX ICATION FRUITS PRESERVED IN ARDENT SPIRITS AND ALL BEVER AGES CONTAINING MORE THAN ONEHALF OF ONE PER CENTUM OF ALCOHOL BY VOLUME EXCEPT AS HEREINAFTER PROVIDED  ACTS OF VIRGINIA 1916 CH 146 P 216 639VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW IT IS CLEAR THAT VIRGINIA HAS PROHIBITED THE SALE FOR BEVERAGE PURPOSES OF ALL INTOXICATING LIQUORS IT IS EQUALLY TRUE THAT IT HAS GONE FURTHER AND PROHIBITED THE SALE OF LIQUORS WHICH ARE NOT INTOXICATING VIRGINIA IS ONE OF THE CLASS OF STATES TO WHICH THE REED AMENDMENT APPLIES AND THEREFORE THE IMPORTATION THEREIN OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS IS THEREBY PROHIBITED IT CAN HARDLY BE CONTENDED HOWEVER THAT ALL THE THINGS FALLING WITHIN THE DEFINITION PLACED UPON ARDENT SPIRITS IN THE VIRGINIA STAT UTE ARE PROHIBITED BY THE REED AMENDMENT TO BE IMPORTED INTO VIRGINIA A LARGE CLASS OF LIQUORS PROHIBITED TO BE SOLD IN VIR GINIA ARE NOT IN FACT INTOXICATING LIQUORS AND ARE NOT SO DENOM INATED BY THE VIRGINIA LAW BUT IF WE SUBSTITUTE THE TERM IN TOXICATING LIQUORS FOR ARDENT SPIRITS IN THE VIRGINIA STATUTE THE LEGAL SITUATION WOULD NOT SEEML TO BE AFFECTED IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT CONGRESS IN ENACTING AN ACT EXCLUDING INTOXI CATING LIQUORS FROM THE STATE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN TENDED THAT HARMLESS ARTICLES SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THE CHAN NELS OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE SO FAR AS IMPORTATION INTO A STATE IS CONCERNED MERELY BECAUSE THEY SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE TERMS OF THE STATE PROHIBITION STATUTE EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD FALL WITHIN A CLASS DENOMINATED BY SUCH STATUTE INTOXICATING LIQ UORS THE PROHIBITION STATUTE OF WEST VIRGINIA 13 PROHIBITS THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF LIQUORS AND DEFINES THAT TERM AS IN CLUDING AMONG OTHER THINGS ALL MALT OR BREWED DRINKS WHETHER INTOXICATING OR NOT HOW ELSE CAN THE APPLICABILITY OF THE PROHIBITION OF IMPORTATION IN THE FEDERAL ACT AS TO MALT OR BREWED DRINKS BE TESTED OTHER THAN BY ASCERTAINING WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTUALLY INTOXICATING AND IF THIS BE TRUE THE SAME TEST IS TO BE APPLIED EVEN THOUGH THE LIQUOR IN QUESTION BE DENOMINATED AN INTOXICATING LIQUOR IN THE STATE PROHIBITION LAW THE GEORGIA LAW 14 FORBIDS THE SALE OF PROHIBITED LIQUORS AND BEVERAGES AND DEFINES THAT TERM AS INCLUDING AMONG OTHER THINGS ALL LIQUORS AND BEVERAGES OR DRINKS MADE IN IMI TATION OF OR INTENDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR BEER ALE WINE OR WHIS KEY OR OTHER ALCOHOLIC OR SPIRITUOUS VINOUS OR MALT LIQUORS IN 640  ACTS OF 1913 CH 13 14 ACTS OF 1915 P 77THE REED BONEDRY AMENDMENT CLUDING THOSE LIQUORS AND BEVERAGES COMMONLY KNOWN AND CALLED NEARBEER SURELY IT CANNOT BE CONTENDED THAT THE FEDERAL ACT PROHIBITS THE IMPORTATION INTO GEORGIA OF A NONINTOXICATING LIQUID MERELY BECAUSE IT IS MADE IN IMITATION OF OR INTENDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE LIQUORS NAMED IN THE STATUTE AND THEREBY FALLS WITHIN THE TERMS OF THE STATE PROHIBITION WHAT COMPASS IS THERE TO STEER BY IN CONSTRUING THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION IN RESPECT TO THE IMPORTATION OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS OTHER THAN THE TEST OF WHETHER THEY ARE ACTUALLY INTOXICATING IF THE TERMS OF STATE STATUTES ARE NOT CONTROLLING IN DETERMIN ING WHAT LIQUORS ARE PROHIBITED FROM BEING IMLORTED INTO A STATE WHICH FORBIDS THE SALE OF ALL INTOXICATING LIQUORS IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE TERMS OF STATE STATUTES ARE NOT CONTROLLING IN DE TERMINING WHETHER THE STATE IN QUESTION PROHIBITS THE SALE OF ALL INTOXICATING LIQUORS IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE LANGUAGE OF THE WEBBKENYON ACT IT IS ENTITLED AN ACT DIVESTING INTOXICAT ING LIQUORS OF THEIR INTERSTATE CHARACTER IN CERTAIN CASES AND PROVIDES OMITTING WORDS THAT ARE NOT INTERESTING HERE THAT THE SHIPMENT OR TRANSPORTATION IN ANY MANNER OR BY ANY MEANS WHATSOEVER OF ANY SPIRITUOUS VINOUS MALTED FERMENTED OR OTHER INTOXICATING LIQUOR OF ANY KIND FROM ONE STATE    INTO ANY OTHER STATE    WHICH SAID SPIRITUOUS VINOUS MALTED FERMENTED OR OTHER INTOXICATING LIQUOR IS INTENDED BY ANY PERSON INTERESTED THEREIN TO BE RECEIVED POSSESSED SOLD OR IN ANY MANNER USED EITHER IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE OR OTHER WISE IN VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OF SUCH STATE    IS HEREBY PROHIBITED THIS ACT AND THE REED AMENDMENT ARE TO BE CON SIDERED IN PARI NMATERIA IN SO FAR AS THE POINT UNDER DISCUSSION IS CONCERNED WHILE THE PURPOSE OF THE FORMER IS TO SUBJECT THE IMPORTATION OF THE LIQUORS DESCRIBED TO THE CONTROL OF THE STATES AND OF THE LATTER TO DIVEST THE STATES OF CONTROL OVER THE IMPOR TATION OF LIQUORS IN CERTAIN INSTANCES YET IN EACH THE APPLICABIL ITY OF THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION IS DETERMINED BY THE STATE LAW AND THE METHOD OF DEALING WITH THE SUBJECTMATTER IS SIMILAR THE LANGUAGE OF THE WEBBKENYON ACT SEEMS CLEARLY TO CONFINE THE PROHIBITION TO ARTICLES ACTUALLY FALLING WITHIN THE DESCRIPTION AS A MATTER OF FACT OR TO EXPRESS IT DIFFERENTLY AS A MIATTER OF FED 641VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ERAL LAW AND TO EXCLUDE ANY CONTENTION THAT THE APPLICABILITY OF THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION IS DEPENDENT TO ANY DEGREE UPON THE DESCRIPTION IN THE STATE LAWS OF LIQUORS THE RECEIPT POSSESSION SALE OR USE OF WHICL IS MADE UNLAWFULL5 THE LANGUAGE OF THE WILSON ACT IS ALSO OF INTEREST THAT ACT PROVIDES THAT ALL FERMENTED DISTILLED OR OTHER INTOXICAT ING LIQUORS OR LIQUIDS TRANSPORTED INTO ANY STATE    SHALL UPON ARRIVAL IN SUCH STATE    BE SUBJECT TO THE OP ERATION AND EFFECT OF THE LAWS OF SUCH STATE ETC EVIDENTLY THE STATE IS HERE GIVEN CONTROL WITH RESPECT ONLY TO THE LIQUORS IN FACT FALLING WITHIN THE DESCRIPTION IN THE FEDERAL ACT AND CANNOT BY VIRTUE OF THE FEDERAL ACT UNDERTAKE TO PREVENT THE SALE OF ARTICLES NOT FALLING WITHIN THAT DESCRIPTION BY DENOMI NATING THEM FERMENTED DISTILLED OR OTHER INTOXICATING LIQ UORS ATTENTION IS CALLED TO THE EXCEPTION CONTAINED IN THE REED AMENDMENT EXCEPT FOR SCIENTIFIC SACRAMENTAL MEDICINAL AND MTECHANICAL PURPOSCS THE PROHIBITION AGAINST SALE CONTAINED IN THE STATE LAW MAY FORBID SALE FOR SCIENTIFIC ETC PURPOSES AS WELL AS FOR BEVERAGE PURPOSES NEVERTHELESS IT IS CLEAR THAT THE IMPORTATION INTO A STATE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES IS NOT A VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL ACT THIS INDICATES THAT IT WAS NOT THE PURPOSE OF CONGRESS TO MAKE THE APPLICABIL ITY OF ITS PROHIBITIONS COINCIDENT WITH THE PROHIBITIONS CONTAINED IN THE STATE ANTISALE LAWS IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO ESCAPE THE CONCLUSION THAT THE OPERATION OF THE REED AMENDMENT IS CONFINED TO PRO HIBITING THE IMPORTATION EXCEPT FOR SCIENTIFIC SACRAMENTAL ME DICINAL AND MECHANICAL PURPOSES OF ALL LIQUORS IN FACT INTOXI CATING INTO ANY STATE WHICH PROHIBITS THE MANUFACTURE OR SALE FOR BEVERAGE PURPOSES OF ALL LIQUORS IN FACT INTOXICATING JOHN K GRAVES WASHINGTON D C 16 IF THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS ARTICLE ARE CORRECT SOME OF THE STATES HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO EXCLUDE LIQUIDS WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THE WEBBKENYON ACT AND WHICH ARE THEREFORE NOT SUBJECT TO STATE CON TROL WHEN MOVING IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE 642

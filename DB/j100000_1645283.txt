POPULATION CHANGE THERE have recently appeared some figures2 regarding the mouvement de la population in France Prussia and Bavaria which appear to deserve somewhat more careful analysis than they have received These figures are derived from official sources and are con veniently collected in the place to which I have made reference There are three factors fundamentally con cerned in producing changes in the absolute size of the population in a given fixed area country province etc These are 1 The birthrate 2 The deathrate 3 The net immigration rate Of these factors the two first are generally speaking of the greatest biological interest This is particularly true of such political units as France Prussia and Bavaria where in normal times net immigration makes rno significant contribution to the population Under war conditions permanent immigration to these units was nil and may therefore be safely neglected in the following discussion The relation of birthrate and deathrate changes to population changes is a simple one and may be put this way If in a given time unit the percentage 100 Deaths Births  has a value less than 100 it means that the births exceed the deaths and that the popula tion is increasing within the specified time 1 Papers from the department of biometry and Vital statistics School of Hygiene and Public Health Johns Hopkins University No 14

of France was at nearly twice as high a level as in any of the other countries dealt with This fact was of course well known With a very low birth rate and a deathrate of the same general order of magnitude as that prevailing in other European countries the French deathbirth ratio could not be anything but extremely high 2 In all the countries here dealt with the deathbirth ratio in general rises throughout the war period This means that the pro portion of deaths to births increased as long as the war continued In France it was slightly more than double in 1918 what it was in 1913 The same was in general true of Prussia and Bavaria These states started from a very different base in 1913 and the relative rise was even greater 3 In England and Wales while the death birth ratio increased throughout the war period the rate of this increase was markedly slower than in any of the other countries dealt with 4 A straight line is not a particularly good fit to the French curve but it has been used in order to demonstrate more clearly the gen eral trend In 1915 and 1916 the French percentage rose markedly above the straight line These were perhaps the years when the forces of war impinged most heavily upon the French 5 It is noteworthy that despite the epi demic of influenza in 1918 unprecedented in its severity so far as this disease is concerned none of the curves shows any sharp or marked rise in that year The curve for England and Wales comes nearest to showing an effect of 555 the epidemic but even then the rise in 1918 is not so marked as one might have expected 6 The straight lines for France Prussia and Bavaria are nearly parallel or in other words have slopes of about the same order of magnitude cf the values of b which deter mine the slope in the straight line equations The slope of the line for England and Wales is very different from that of the other three These facts raise many interesting points for discussion The people of Prussia and Bavaria suffered progressive deprivations in respect of food and other comforts of life throughout the war The sufferings of the French people in these respects were undoubt edly less severe than those of the Germans All however lived for several years on an inadequate diet This fact alone unquestion ably contributed to an everincreasing death rate particularly at the two ends of the life cycle This same dietary factor undoubtedly also played a considerable part in producing the steady fall in the birthrate Here how ever the psychological factor also had a large role and this introduces a point of great interest Psychologically the civilian French population and the civilian German popula tion were on a different footing In the one case until well into 1918 the attitude was that of the potential conqueror fighting as an invader in the others territory In the other case a war of defense against invasion and further destruction of the home land was being fought Yet the net effect on the vital indices of the population was as is shown by the essential parallelism of the straight lines substantially the same in the one case as in the other In any other game than war the psychological attitude of offender pro duces far different results from that of de fender Here the essential and out standing fact is that the net biological outcome of the complex interplay of forces resulting from war was almost identically the same in France and Germany Another interesting point is that while France started in 1913 with a deathbirth ratio 40 per cent higher than that of the German statesshe having at that time anN S VoL LI No 1327 approximate equality of births and deaths nevertheless the biological changes induced by the war as expressed in this ratio were the same for the one as for the others We are evidently dealing here with deepseated and fundamental phenomena of racial biology The biological reactions of French and Ger mans in respect of a most fundamental phe nomenon the deathbirth ratio were essen tially the same though they started from such different prewar bases The case of England is obviously entirely different Starting from about the same base as the German states Englands biological re action to war was much less pronounced There are many explanations such as better food conditions different race psychology from any of the other belligerents etc which might be brought forward There appears at the moment no way of accurately evaluating any of these possible explanations We must perforce rest with the setting forth of the facts It is worth noting however that though Englands vital index changed less in degree than that of the other countries its movement was the same in kind There are two other points which one would like to have information upon The first is What will be the course of these deathbirth ratio curves in the years following 1918 Will they come back to the prewar level and if so how soon For England and Wales alone is it now possible to get an indication on this point For the year 1919 the relation 100 Deaths  ths had the value 73 per cent This Births represents a marked drop though it does not bring the curve back to the prewar level The appearance of official statistics which will make possible the further plotting of the curves of Fig 1 will be awaited with great interest In the second place one would like to know what the appearance of the curve for the United States would be Unfortunately we have for the Registration Area of births data only for the years 1915 1916 and 1917 now available So few years appear inade quate to set against the longer series for the other countries RAYMOND PEARL THE JOHNS HOPKINS TNIVERSITY

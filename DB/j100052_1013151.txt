150 New York The Shakespeare Press 1914 This book ranges the whole gamut of rural economics and marketing It deals with agencies controlling price the exchanges cooperation selling of differ ent commodities such as fruits live stock tobacco peanuts grain and cotton rural credits home ownership and the cost of living The best chapters are those dealing with the exchanges co6peration and sales

ruleddebauched and died to the Battle of Tra falgar and Napoleons conquests Platitudes hold concourse with fallacies as to wit Analyze these conditions and tendencies young man of America and study what they mean More of the rural population are to be started to farther aggravate overurbanism You must face the future whether you wish to or not C L K DURAND EDWARD D The Trust Problem Pp 145 Price 100 Cambridge Harvard University Press 1915 This book brings together under one cover a series of articles which appeared in the Quarterly Journal of Economics during the year 1914 and contains as an appendix all the federal laws relating to trusts The subject matter is well indi cated by the Chapter headings These are The Necessity of Prohibition or Regulation The Possibility of Preventing Combination Difficulties of Regulat ing Combinations The Alleged Advantages of Combination The Trust Legisla tion of 1914 The conclusion of the author who as secretary of the Industrial Commission has had unusual opportunities in this field is that the trust move ment is essentially artificial in its nature By resort to general reasoning adequate data are lacking for a scientific study of the facts he endeavors to show that the alleged economies of the trust form of organization are unimportant Price regulation in addition is found to be very difficult Naturally therefore the author finds himself approving the principle of the trust legislation of 1914 though venturing in an able discussion of this measure to criticize it in several particulars E J 288BOOK DEPARTMENT HOBSON C K The Export of Capital Pp xxv 264 Price 200 New York The Macmillan Company 1914 The present European war with the consequent liquidation on our exchanges of American securities has stimulated interest in the question of international investments some aspects of which this volume exhaustively treats While available figures do not warrant definite statistical conclusions this work is valu able as throwing needed light on the advisability in a national sense of the exportation of capital Its principal value is as a carefully worked out estimate of the extent of British foreign investment during 18701912 while its detailed history of this use of capital shows the causes of the rise of London to the position of the worlds financial center Little additional insight is given into the effects of foreign investment R R MOORE HENRY LUDWELL Economic Cycles Their Law and Cause Pp viii 149 Price 200 New York The Macmillan Company 1914 In this book Professor Moore has attempted to determine the law and cause of economic cycles by the application of the statistical method He begins with the hypothesis that there must be some physical cause at work to account for so general a movement as alternate periods of depression and prosperity The most fundamental need of man being food it is possible that this physical cause is in some way related to the food supply He first investigates the question as to whether there is a periodicity in the annual amount of rainfall and chooses data from the Ohio Valley and Illinois as being most representative among available data of the cropproducing area of the United States He discovers cycles of approximately thirtythree and eight years in the annual rainfall of these sections These cycles are then correlated with crop yields and a close relationship estab lished The further analysis of his problem consists in relating the physical yield of the crops with their value and finally with cyclical changes in the activity of business and in general prices He thus makes the law of cycles of the crops the law of economic cycles Professor Moore repeatedly cautions throughout his essay that the laws he states are at first only proximate laws and must wait for their authentication until similar studies have been made for other places and other times B D M NEARING SCOTT Income an Examination of the Returns for Services Rendered and from Property Owned in the United States Pp xxvii 238 Price 125 New York The Macmillan Company 1915 PEDDIE J TAYLOR First Principles of Production Pp 231 Price 175 New York Longmans Green and Company 1915 On page 20 the author names four factors of production 1 material 2 labour 3 establishment charges 4 profit He does not show clearly however the principles mentioned in the title He writes on page 81 To 289THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY dwell on the aims of Industry would be futile Possibly so but it would have been well if he had considered those aims before he wrote most of this work and published the whole He identifies production and manufacturing technique also large profits for British manufacturers and national prosperity thus following popular usage The book is a collection of pamphlets pleading vaguely for the more extended use of chemical research in British industry and for governmental aid in the training of industrial chemists The timeworn moral is drawn from German experience The subject and its treatment have been common enough in the popular magazines of this countrynot so common perhaps in Great Britain Appended to the authors work are several articles and addresses by a few British scientists and a steel manufacturer All lead to the same general conclusion that the closer application of chemical research to British industry will bring increased profits to British manufacturers and consequently greater glory to the British Empire The whole book is a negligible contribution to recent literature of efficiency and of mercantile imperialistic patriotism A A O MONEY BANKING AND FINANCE Reviews MA YIN CHU The Finances of the City of New York Pp 312 Price 250 New York Longmans Green and Company 1914 New Yorkers may not consider themselves complimented by Dr Mas com parison of former New York financing with that of China but they may at any rate appreciate his efforts in analyzing the financial practices now followed His treatment is divided into four parts viz scientific budget making the system of taxation the city debt and control of revenues and expenditures under the new system of accounting The author very clearly and effectively emphasizes the necessity of segrega tion of budgetary estimates as regards both the function to be performed and the objects of the expenditure showing its numerous advantages This is fol lowed by a description of the preparation and examination of budgetary estimates and a discussion of the procedure of hearing voting funding and administering the budget The chapter on real estate taxation is one of the best brief treatments of the subject that has ever been brought to the reviewers notice Other taxes are discussed briefly in a single chapter Discussion of the city debt occupies three chapters Control of revenues and expenditures is treated in four The first and last sections of the book are the best In them the collection of subject matter is valuable and the analysis clear and convincing The same may be said of the chapter on real estate taxation although in it the author adopts too readily the view that there must be a separation of state and local taxation The section dealing with the city debt presents clearly the two leading classes of loans shows the evils of past methods of borrowing and describes the new methods of financing The treatment however is not symmetrical giving for example 290

AND CAUSE OF ECONOMIC CYCLES BY THE APPLICATION OF THE STATISTICAL METHOD HE BEGINS WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THERE MUST BE SOME PHYSICAL CAUSE AT WORK TO ACCOUNT FOR SO GENERAL A MOVEMENT AS ALTERNATE PERIODS OF DEPRESSION AND PROSPERITY THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL NEED OF MAN BEING FOOD IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS PHYSICAL CAUSE IS IN SOME WAY RELATED TO THE FOOD SUPPLY HE FIRST INVESTIGATES THE QUESTION AS

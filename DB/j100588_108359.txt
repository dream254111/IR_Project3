J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108359,MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON ANIMAL HEAT,I206999, 57 1 V MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON ANIMAL HEAT BY JOHN DAVY MD FRS L AND E RECEIVED NOVEMBER 2READ DECEMBER 14 1843 I ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE PELAMIDES PELAMYS SARDA CUV AND VAL FISHES GENERALLY ARE COMMONLY CONSIDERED AS COLDBLOODED IN A WORK PUBLISHED IN 1839 I HAVE STATED PARTICULARS TENDING TO SHOW THAT THIS COMMONLY RECEIVED OPINION IS NOT UNIVERSALLY CORRECT AND THAT FISHLES OF THE GENUS THYNNUS WITH SOME OTHERS OF THE SCOMBER FAMILY MAY BE INFERRED TO BE AN EXCEPTION AS THIS INFERENCE WAS FOUNDED CHIEFLY ON THE REPORTS OF FISHERMEN IT APPEARED VERY DESIRABLE TO DETERMINE BY ACTUAL THERMOMETRICAL MEASUREMENT WHAT IS THE EXACT TEM PERATURE OF FISHES OF THIS FAMILY HITHERTO ALTHOUGH WATCHING FOR OPPORTUNITIES AND PROMISED THE AID OF FRIENDS FAVOURABLY SITUATED I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ANY OBSERVATIONS OF THE KIND REQUIRED EXCEPTING ON ONE SPECIES OF THESE FISHES THE PELAMRIDES THE PELAMYS SARDA OF CUVIER AND VALENCIENNES THE PELAMIDES LIKE MOST OF ITS CONGENERS IS MIGRA TORY IN ITS HABITS IN THE EARLY PART OF SUMMER IT APPEARS IN THE SEA OF MARMORA AND THE BOSPHORUS AND IN AUGUST IN THE BLACK SEA FROM WHENCE AFTER SPAWNING IT RETURNS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER ON ITS PASSAGE TO THE MEDITERRANEAN IT IS CAUGHT IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE TUNNY IN JUNE 1841 WHILST AT CONSTANTINOPLE I VISITED A FISHING STATION FOR THIS FISH IN AN INLET OF THE SEA OF MARMORA AND WAS PRESENT WHEN A SMALL CAPTURE WAS MADE ENABLING ME TO ASCERTAIN THE TEMPERATURE OF FOUR SPECIMENS THIS WAS DONE THE IN STANT THEY WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE WATER BEING IN A BOAT ALONGSIDE THE NET BY INTRO DUCING A THERMOMETER WITH A PROJECTING BULB THROUGH A SMALL INCISION INTO THE MUSCLE OF THE BACK ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER INTO THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN IN THREE INSTANCES THE THERMOMETER IN THE BACK ROSE TO 75 FAHR IN ONE TO 740 IN ALL IN THE ABDOMEN IT ROSE TO 73 THE PELAMIDES WERE OF MODERATE SIZE BETWEEN TWO AND THREE FEET LONG THE AIR AT THE TIME WAS 71 THE SEA AT THE SURFACE 68 BUT PROBABLY AT THE DEPTH FROM WHICH THE FISHES WERE TAKEN IT WAS A FEW DEGREES LOWER THE DESCENDING CURRENT OF THE BOSPHORUS THEN BEING WHERE COLDEST AT 620 SUPPOSING THAT THE WATER FROM WHICH THEY WERE TAKEN WAS 620AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOWER AS THE PELAMIDES SWIM IN DEEP WATERTHE TEMPERATURE OF THIS FISH WOULD APPEAR TO BE ABOUT 12 ABOVE THE MEDIUM IN WHICH IT SWIMS AND AT LEAST 70 ABOVE THAT OF THE SURFACE  RESEARCHES PHYSIOLOGICAL AND ANATOMICAL VOL I P 218 MDCCCXLIV IDR DAVY ON ANIMAL HEAT THIS RESULT SEEMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INFERENCE THAT ALL FISLES ARE NOT COLD BLOODED IN THE WORK ALREADY REFERRED TO REASONING FROM THE SMALLER SIZE OF THE RESPIRATORY NERVES OF THE PELARNYS SARDA COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE TUNNY I OFFERED THE CONJECTURE THAT ITS TEMPERATURE WOULD BE FOUND LESS THAN THAT OF THE TUNNY AND SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THAT OF FISHES OF OTHER ORDERS WITH STILL SMALLER RE SPIRATORY NERVES A CONJECTURE WHICH THE OBSERVATIONS DESCRIBED MAY BE ADDUCED AS CONFIRMING IN CONNEXION WITH THEIR TEMPERATURE MY ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE BLOOD OF THESE FISHES I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXAMINE IT ONLY IN THREE INSTANCES AND THAT PAR TIALLY VIZ THE SWORDFISH THE PELAMYS SARDA AND THE COMMON TUNNY CONSIDERING THE GREAT DIFFICULTY THERE IS IN OBTAINING THE SUBJECTS FOR EXPERIMENT UNDER FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR EXAMINATION IMPERFECT AS WERE MY RESULTS I ANM INDUCED TO OFFER THEM NOW THLE SWORDFISH APPEARS TO ABOUND LESS IN BLOOD THAN THE PELAMNIDES AND THE PELA  MIDES LESS THAN THE COMMON TUNNY AND ACCORDINGLY THE MUSCLES OF THE FORMER TWO ARE OF A MUCH LIGHTER COLOUR THAN THOSE OF THE LATTER THE BLOOD OF THE TUNNY IS VERY RICH IN RED PARTICLES THIS IS INDICATED NOT ONLY BY ITS APPEARANCE BUT ALSO BY ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHICH I HAVE FOUND AS HIGH AS 1070 THE BLOOD TRIED WAS TAKEN FROM A FISH CAUGHT IN THE SEA OF MARMORA THAT WEIGHED BETWEEN TWO AND THREE HUNDRED POUNDS THE BLOOD OF THE PELAMIDES APPEARS TO BE LESS RICH IN RED PARTICLES THAN THAT OF THE TUNNY BUT MORE THAN THAT OF THE SWORDFISH I HAVE NOT ASCERTAINED ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE BLOOD OF THE SWORDFISH I HAVE FOUND TO BE 1P051 THE FISH FROM WHICH THE BLOOD WAS TAKEN WAS CAUGHT IN THE BOSPLORUS IN THE MONTH OF DECEMBER AND WAS OF LARGE SIZE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE THE APPEARANCE OF THE REDL PARTICLES OF THE BLOOD OF THESE THREE FISHES IS VERY SIMILAR THEY ARE COMMONLY THIN OVAL DISCS VERY SOFT CONTAINING OVAL NUCLEI A FEW CIRCULAR DISCS ARE INTERMIXED WITH THEM THE MEDIUM DIMENSIONS OF THOSE OF THE PELAMIDES WERE ABOUT JOTH OF AN INCH BY 3JOTH OF THE SWORDFISH ABOUT 3OOOTH BY TOOTH AND OF THE TUNNY ABOUT 8O50TH BY 8 O30 THAT THE RED PARTICLES CONSTITUTE THAT PORTION OF THE BLOOD WHICH IS CHIEFLY CON CERNED IN THE PRODUCTION OF ANIMAL HEAT IS NOW GENERALLY ADMITTED WHAT A CONTRAST APPEARS IN COMPARING THE BLOOD OF THE FISHES UNDER CONSIDERATION WITH THAT OF SOME OF THE COLDER ESPECIALLY OF THE CARTILAGINOUS KIND IN WHICH IT IS VERY SMALL IN QUAN TITY ACCOMPANIED BY A PROPORTIONALLY DIMINUTIVE HEART AND POOR IN RED PARTICLES  THE BLOOD OF THE SQUALUS ACANTHIAS I HAVE FOUND TO EXCEED IN DENSITY ONLY A LITTLE ITS SEVLUM ONE BEING OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY 1P030 THE OTHER OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY 1027 WHETHER THE PECULIAR CONSTITUTION OF THE RED PARTICLES OPERATES IN ANY WAY IN PRO MOTING THEIR UNION WITH OXYGEN SEEMS TO BE DESERVING OF CONSIDERATION IT MAY BE THROWN OUT AS A CONJECTURE THAT THE CIRCURNSTANCE OF THEIR POSSESSING NUCLEI MAY 58DR DAVY ON ANIMAL HEAT HAVE AN EFFECT OF THE KIND SUPPOSING WHICH IS POSSIBLE THE BLOODCORPUSCLE AND NUCLEUS OR CONTAINING AND CONTAINED PART TO BE IN THE ELECTRICAL RELATION TO EACH OTHER OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IF IT BE OBJECTED TO THIS THAT AS REGARDS NUCLEI AS WELL AS SIZE THERE IS AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE BLOODCORPUSCLE OF FISHES BIRDS AND REPTILES THE TEMPERATURE OF WHICH COMMONLY IS SO VERY DIFFERENT IT MAY BE ANSWERED THAT IN ALL THESE CLASSES SUCH A CONSTITUTION OF BLOODCORPUSCLE MAY BE DESIGNED FOR THE SAME END AND THAT BIRDS PARTLY OWE THEIR HIGH TEMPERATURE TO IT AND THAT IN REPTILES AND FISHES IN MOST OF WHICH THE PROPORTION OF RED PARTICLES IS SMALL WERE THE CONSTITUTION OF BLOODCORPUSCLE DIFFERENT IT WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO PERFORM THE PART REQUIRED OF IT II ON THE TEMPERATURE OF MAN IN ADVANCED AGE NOT AWARE OF ANY OBSERVATIONS HAVING BEEN PUBLISHED ON THE TEMPERATURE OF MAN IN ADVANCED OLD AGE I HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO INSTITUTE SOME TRIALS THE RESULTS OF WHICH I SHALL NOW BRIEFLY DESCRIBE 1 91 YEARS OF AGE FEEBLE ON HIS LEGS BUT IN PRETTY GOOD HEALTH  A NATIVE OF GRASMERE IN WESTMORELAND WHERE HE HAS ALWAYS RESIDED IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES CULTIVATING HIS OWN LAND IN JUNE WHEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS 60 A THER MOMETER PLACED UNDER THE TONGUE ROSE TO 9905 HIS HANDS WERE WARM HIS PULSE AT THE WRIST 48 STRONG INTERMITTING THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE AT 2 PM HE HAD DINED AT NOON ON THE 28TH OF THE OCTOBER FOLLOWING HIS TEMPERATURE WAS AGAIN TRIED ABOUT THE SAME TIME OF DAY WHEN THE OPEN AIR WAS 42 THE AIR OF HIS ROOM 520 NOW UNDER THE TONGUE THE THERMOMETER WAS 9805 THE PULSE 56 HIS STATE OF HEALTH MUCH THE SAME AS BEFORE 6 2 88 YEARS OF AGE ALSO A NATIVE OF GRASMERE WHERE HE HAS MOSTLY RESIDED AS A DAY LABOURER IS PRETTY FIRM ON HIS FEET BUT TROUBLED WITH CHRONIC COUGH AND DIFFI CULTY OF BREATHING IN JUNE WHEN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS 60 A THERMOMETER PLACED UNDER THE TONGUE ROSE TO 9905 HIS PULSE WAS 56 AND RATHER FEEBLE HE HAD DINED THREE HOURS PREVIOUSLY ON THE 28TH OF OCTOBER AN HOUR AFTER DINNER WHEN HIS PULSE WAS 70 THE THERMOMETER UNDER THE TONGUE WAS 980 THE AIR OF THE ROORN 55 IN FEBRUARY ABOUT THREE HOURS AFTER DINNER WHEN HIS PULSE WAS 44 AND FEEBLE THE TEMPERATURE UNDER THE TONGUE WAS 96 THIS WAS ON THE 27TH THE AIR THEN OF HIS ROOM WAS 440 THE OPEN AIR ABOUT 32 AFTER A HEAVY FALL OF SNOW AND A SHARP FROST OF SEVERAL DAYS DURATION THE OLD MAN WAS FEEBLER THAN IN THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN AND THOUGH HE DID NOT COMPLAIN OF COLD HIS HAND FELT COLD 3 THE WIFE OF THE PRECEDING THE MOTHER OF SEVERAL CHILDREN 76 YEARS OF AGE HALE FOR HER YEARS BUT BLIND FROM CATARACT COMPLICATED WITH AMAUROSIS HER TEMN PERATURE TRIED AT THE SAME TIME AS HER HUSBANDS IN JUNE WAS FOUND UNDER THE TONGUE TO BE 9805 HER PULSE 78 AND PRETTY STRONG TRIED AGAIN IN OCTOBER IT WAS FOUND TO BE 98 WITH A PULSE OF 70 AND AGAIN IN FEBRUARV ON THE 27TH IT WAS FOUND TO BE 99 HER PULSE BEING 80 I2 59DR DAVY ON ANIMAL HEAT 4 87 YEARS OF AGE A NATIVE OF AMBLESIDE WHLERE SHE HAS COMMONLY RESIDED FEEBLE BUT EXCEPTING CHRONIC COUGH IN TOLERABLE HEALTH ON THE 26TH OF OCTOBER AT 3 PM THE TEMPERATURE UNDER THE TONGUE WAS FOUND TO BE 985  HER PULSE 84 AND PRETTY STRONG THE AIR OF THE ROOM THEN WAS 570 THE OPEN AIR ABOUT 42 5 ON THE SAME DAY AND IN THE SAME VILLAGE TRIED THE TEMPERATURE OF ANOTHER OLD INHABITANT 92 YEARS OF AGE THE THERMOMETER UNDER HER TONGUE STOOD ABOUT 98 IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED WITH PERFECT EXACTNESS ON ACCOUNT OF THE TREMULOUS MOTION OF HER HEAD WHICH ALSO AFFECTED THE LIMBS PREVENTING THE COUNTING OF HER PULSE HER GENERAL HEALTH WAS PRETTY GOOD 6 AN INHABITANT OF AMBLESIDE BY TRADE A HATTER 89 YEARS OF AGE HALE ABLE TO WALK TO CHURCH ON THE 27TH OF OCTOBER WHEN THE AIR OF HIS ROOM WAS 56 THE OUTER AIR 42 HIS PULSE 64 STRONG AND REGULAR THE THERMORNETER UNDER HIS TONGUE STOOD AT 980 OBSERVED AGAIN ON THE 27TH OF FEBRUARY AT 1 PM JUST AFTER DINNER WHEN THE OUTER AIR WAS 32 THE AIR OF HIS ROOM 54 THE TEMPERATURE UNDER HIS TONGUE WAS FOUND TO BE 995 HIS PULSE 70 7 THE TEMPERATURE OF HIS WIFE TWO YEARS YOUNGER TAKEN ON THE 27TH OF OCTOBER WAS 985 HER PULSE WAS 88 IRREGULAR SHE WAS VERY INFIRM AND SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA 8 A NATIVE OF SCOTLAND 95 YEARS OF AGE NOW RESIDING IN AMBLESIDE WHERLE BE HAS BEEN MANY YEARS ALWAYS IN GOOD HEALTH STILL TOLERABLY STRONG AND ACTIVE ON THE 28TH OF OCTOBER FOUND HIS TEMPERATURE UNDER THE TONGUE 985 HIS PULSE 56 INTER MITTING THE AIR OF HIS ROOM 57 THE OLD PEOPLE IN ALL THE PRECEDING INSTANCES AT THE TIME THE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE WERE SITTING BY THEIR FIRESIDE AS IS THEIR USAGE IN THE COOL CLIMATE OF WESTMORELAND THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR AND ALL OF THEM WITH ONE EXCEPTION SEEMED TO BE COMFORTABLY WARM THE POOREST OF THEM WERE NOT IN WANT OLD AGE IS COMMONLY REPRESENTED AS COLD AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY IS COM MONLY SUPPOSED TO DIMINISH WITH ADVANCING AGE THE RESULTS OF THE PRECEDING OBSER VATIONS GENERALLY ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION THEY SEEM ON THE CONTRARY TO SHOW THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF OLD PEOPLE AT LEAST AS REGARDS THE DEEPSEATED PARTS OF WHICH THE TONGUE AT ITS BASE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS SOME INDICATION IS RATHER ABOVE THAN BELOW THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF MIDDLE AGE TAKING THAT TO BE ABOUT 98 OF FAHR NOR PERHAPS IS THIS SURPRISING WHEN WE REFLECT THAT MOST OF THE FOOD CON SUMED BY OLD PERSONSAND THEIR APPETITE GENERALLY IS GOODIS PROBABLY CHIEFLY EM PLOYED IN ADMINISTERING TO THE FUNCTION OF RESPIRATION BEING VERY PARTIALLY EXPENDED IN MEETING THE WASTE OF THE BODY PROBABLY IN VERY ADVANCED OLD AGE AS IN VERY EARLY INFANCY THE POWER OF RESIST ANCE TO COLD IS FEEBLE AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY IS EASILY REDUCED ON EXPOSURE AN OBSERVATION WHICH I MADE MANY YEARS AGO IN CEYLON WOULD SEEM TO BE CONFIRMA TORY OF THIS AT 7 OCLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN THE AIR WAS 72 I TRIED THE TEMPE RATURE OF AN OLD MAN ALMOST A CENTURY OLD AND OF A BOY ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OLD BOTH COOL BEING THINLY CLAD AND OUT OF DOORS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE OLD MAN UNDER THE ONGUE WAS 95 IN THE AXILLA 93 THAT OF THE BOY UNDER THE FORMER 98 AND IN THE 60DR DAVY ON ANIMAL HEAT LATTER 965 THE OBSERVATION TOO ON THE OLD MAN IN GRASMERE MADE IN FEBRUARY IN COLD WEATHER IS ALSO FAVOURABLE TO THIS CONCLUSION  WHILST THOSE MADE AT THE SAME TIME ON THE OTHER TWO OLD PERSONS IN STRONGER HEALTH SEEM TO SHOW THAT PROVIDED THERE IS A VIGOROUS ACTION OF THE HEART AND FREE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD THE TEMPERA TURE OF THE BODY IS EASILY MAINTAINED III ON THE EFFECT OF AIR OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OZN ANIMAL HEAT AS FROMN OBSERVATIONS MADE ON MAN ON ENTERING THE TROPICS AND WITHIN THE TROPICS ON DESCENDING FROM A COOL MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT TO A HOT LOW COUNTRY IT WOULD AP PEAR THAT HIS TEMPERATURE AS MEASURED BY A THERMOMETER PLACED UNDER THE TONGUEIS LIABLE TO FLUCTUATERISING ONE OR TWO DEGREES IN A WARRTI ATMLOSPHERE AND FALLING AS MUCH ON ENTERING A COOL ONEIT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT LIKE DIFFERENCES OF EFFECT MIGHT BE PRODUCED BY AIR KEPT AT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF TEMPERATURE IN BUILDINGS IN THIS COUNTRY IN THLE AUTUMN OF LAST YEAR WHEN GOING THROUGH THE COTTON MANUFACTORY OF DEAN STONE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF DOUNE IN STIRLINGSHIREAN ESTABLISHMENT ADMIRABLY CONDUCTED AND IN THE HIGHEST ORDERI AVAILED MYSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY THE TEMPERATURE OF A FEW INDIVIDUALS IN RELATION TO THIS QUESTION IN THE ROOM CALLED THE  PIECINGROOM WHERE A HIGH TEMPERATURE IS ALWAYS REQUIRED ON ACCOUNT OF THE KIND OF WORKA TEMPERATURE KEPT UP BY MEANS OF WARM AIR AND STEAMWHEN AT 92 I FOUND THE THERMOMETER PLACED UNDER THE TONGUE OF ONE MAN WHO HAD BEEN AT WORK THERE ABOUT SIX HOURS RISE TO 1005 AND OF ANOTHER WHO HAD BEEN THERE THE SAME TIME TO 1000 THE FORMER WAS 52 YEARS OF AGE HEALTHY HIS PULSE 64  THE OTHER 33 YEARS OF AGE IN PRETTY GOOD HEALTH BUT LIABLE TO ACIDITY OF STOMACH  HIS PULSE 78 IN AN ADJOINING ROOM WHERE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS 730 THE THERMOMETER PLACED UNDER THE TONGUE OF A YOUNG WOMAN ROSE TO 99 AND IN A LARGE ROOM WHERE 300 PERSONS WERE EMPLOYED IN WEAVING AND WHERE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS 60 THE THERMOMETER PLACED UNDER THE TONGUE OF ANOTHER HEALTHY YOUNG WOTNAN ROSE ONLY TO 9705 FEW AS ARE THESE OBSERLVATIONS THEY SEEM TO WARRANT THE CONCLUSION THAT A HIGH TEMPERATURE OF EVEN A FEW HOURS IN THE HEATED AIR OF A ROOM IS CAPABLE OF RAISING THE TEMNPERATURE OF THE BODY ABOVE ITS USUAL STANDARD IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED FRIOM THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT DEGREES OF ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE IN FURTHER CONFIRMATION OF THE SAME I MAY BRIEFLY STATE THE RESULTS OF MULTIPLIED OBSERVATIONS MADE ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SAME INDIVIDUAL THE SUBJECT OF THEM WAS OF MIDDLE AGE IN GOOD HEALTH UNDER WHOSE TONGUE THE THERMOMETER COMMONLY WAS STATIONARY AT 98 WHEN NEITHER SUFFERING FROM HEAT NOR COLD THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE MADE WAS CONSTANTINOPLETHE CLIMATE OF WHICH CAPITAL IT MAY BE OB SERVED IS EXCEEDINGLY VARIABLEOFTEN COLD IN WINTER AND THE EARLY SPRING AND COM MONLY VERY HOT IN SUMMERLIABLE TO GREAT VICISSITUDES FROM ITS SITUATION ON THE  0P CIT I 169 61DR DAVY ON ANIMAL HEAT CONFINES OF TWO SEAS IN REGARD TO WARMTH VERY DIFFERENT IN CHARACTER DURING A GREAT PART OF THE YEAR THE OBSERVATIONS WERE BEGUN EARLY IN MARCH AND WERE CONTINUED AT INTERVALS TILL THE LATTER END OF JULY DURING THIS TIME THE THERMOMETER IN THE OPEN AIR RANGED FROM 31 TO 940 AND THE TEMPERATURE OBSERVED UNDER THE TONGUE FROM 97 TO 9905 IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO MENTION SOME PARTICULAR INSTANCES ON THE 5TH OF MARCH AFTER HAVING BEEN EXPOSED SEVERAL HOURS IN AN OPEN BOAT ON THE BOSPHORUS WITH A STRONG WIND AT 430 THE THERMOMETER PLACED UNDER THE TONGUE STOOD AT 97 ON THE 1 TH OF THE SAME MONTH WHEN THE GROUND WAS COVERED DEEPLY WITHL SNOW AND THE THERMOMETER IN THE OPEN AIR AT 7 AM WAS 310 AND IN A BEDROOM 45 THE TEMPERATURE UNDER THE TONGUE WAS FOUND TO BE 9705 ON THE 3RD OF APRIL WHEN THE THERMOMETER IN THE ROOM WITH THE WINDOW OPEN WAS 66 UNDER THE TONGUE IT WAS 9805 ON THE 17TH OF JULY WHEN THE THERMOMNETER WAS 87 UNDER THE TONGUE IT ROSE TO 9905 ON THE 21ST OF THE SAME MONTH WHEN THE AIR WAS 87 THE TEMPERATURE UNDER THE TONGUE WAS 995  AND ON THE 28TH WHEN THE FOT RNER WAS 94 THE LATTER WAS 990 DURING THE HOT WEATHER OF JULY IT MAY BE DESERVING OF REMARK THAT THE PULSE WAS LESS AFFECTED THAN THE RESPIRATION WHICH HABITUALLY ABOUT SIXTEEN IN THE MINUTE WAS NOW COMMONLY FOURTEEN AND ONE DAY DID NOT EXCEED TWELVE IT MAY ALSO BE MENTIONED THAT ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EXTRE MITIES AND ALSO TO THAT OF THE URINE AND THAT COMMONLY IT WAS FOUND OF HIGHEST TEMNPERATURE WHEN THE TONGUE AND EXTREMITIES WERE OF LOWEST TEMPERATURE THUS ON THE 5TH OF MARCH WHEN THE THERMOMETER UNDER THE TONGUE WAS 97 THE FEET AND HANDS COLD IN THE URINE IT ROSE TO 101 AND ON THE 28TH OF JULY WHEN UNDER THE FORMER IT WAS 9905 IN THE LATTER IT WAS THE SAME DO NOT THESE OBSERVATIONS BESIDES TENDING TO CONFIRM THE PRECEDING CONCLUSION FOR WHICH THEY WERE BROUGHT FORWARD VIZ THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY RISES AND FALLS IN A PERCEPTIBLE MANNER WITH THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR LEAD ALSO TO THE FURTHER CONCLUSION THAT THE TENDENCY OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE OF ATMOSPHERE IS TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SURFACE AND OF THE PARTS ADJOINING THE SURFACE IN A SOMEWHAT HIGHER RATIO THAN THE DEEPSEATED ORGANS AND OF A LOW TEMPERATURE OF ATMOSPHERE TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE DEEPSEATED PARTS WHILST THAT OF THE SURFACE IS SUBJECTED TO UNDUE REDUCTION FROM THE COOLING AGENCIES TO WLICH IT IS EXPOSED DIRECTED AS IT WERE IN BOTH INSTANCES FOR A BENEFICIAL RESULT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPENSATION  IV ON THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY THIS SUBJECT OF INQUIRY NOTWITHSTANDING ITS MANIFEST IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN MUCH NEGLECTED INDEED I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY WORK IN WHICH ANY PRECISE INFORMATION IS TO BE OBTAINED RESPECTING IT THLE OBSERVATIONS WHICH I HAVE TO OFFER ARE FEWER THAN I COULD WISH AND MORE LIMITED THEY WERE MADE AT CONSTANTINOPLE IN 1841 AT INTERVALS BETWEEN FEBRUARY 62BR DAVY ON ANIMAL HEAT AND AUGUST AND HAD FOR THEIR OBJECT MAINLY TO ENDEAVOUR TO DETERTMINE THE EFFECT OF MODERATE EXERCISE IN WALKING ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BODY THE INDIVIDUAL ON WHOM THEY WERE MADE WAS THE SAME AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE LAST SECTION THE PAR TICULAR OBSERVATIONS ARE THE FOLLOWING FEBRUARY 19TH AT 12 PM AIR OF ROOM 60 BEFORE WALKING FEET COLD TEMPERATURE BETWEEN THE TOES 66 UNDER THE TONGUE 98 URINE 100 AT 52 PM OPEN AIR 40 JUST RETURNED FROM A WALK GENTLY WATRMED BY THE EXERCISE FEET AND HANDS WARM THE FORNMET 9605 THE LATTER 97 UNDER THE TONGUE 98 URINE 101 MARCH 2ND AT 4 PM OPEN AIR 50 AIR OF ROOM 66 FEET AND HANDS MODERATELY WARM THE FORMER 750 THE LATTER 81 UNDER THE TONGUE 98 URINE 100 AT 5 PM AFTER HAVING WALKED PRETTY QUICKLV AN HOUR A GENTLE PERSPIRATION PRODUCED THE HANDS AND FEET HOT FOUND THE LATTER 99 THE FORMER 98 UNDER THE TONGUE 980 THE URINE 1015 MARCH 20TH AT 52 PM OPEN AIR 42 RETURNED WARM AFTER A WALK OF THREE HOURS THE HANDS WHICH HAD WORN WARM GLOVES WERE 99 FEET 97 UNDER THE TONGUE 98 THE URINE 10105 APRIL 7TH AFTER A WALK OF THREE HOURS IN THE OPEN AIR BETWEEN 600 AND 700 RETURNED AT 5 PM GENTLY PERSPIRING THE HANDS WERE 940 THE FEET 9605 UNDER THE TONGUE 9805 THE URINE 1005 MAY 27TH AT 6A PM AFTER A WALK OF AN HOUR AND HALF THE AIR 68 RETURNED SLIGHTLY PERSPIRING THE HANDS WERE 956 THE FEET HOT UNDER THE TONGUE 99 5 THE URINE 1015 MAY 28TH AIR 650 UNDER THE TONGUE BEFORE TAKING EXERCISE 9805 AFTER A WALK OF FOUR HOURS AND HALF GENTLY PERSPIRING ILNDER THE TONGUE 98 HANDS 930 FEET 9705 URINE 10005 SEPTEMBER 13 AT 4 PM THE OPEN AIR ON THE SHORE OF THE BOSPHORUS 76 ASCENDED IN ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES WITHOUT STOPPING THE STEEP SIDE OF THE HILL CALLED THE GIANTS MOUNTAIN ON REACHING ITS SUMMIT WHEN PROFUSELY PERSPIRING THE PULSE WAS 1020 USUALLY ABOUT 52 THE HAND 98 UNDER THE TONGUE 98 THE PULSE OF ANOTHER INDI VIDUAL IN COMPANY OF ABOUT THE SAME AGE ALSO PROFUSELY PERSPIRING WAS 138 THER MOMETER UNDER HIS TONGUE 986 AND IN THE HAND THE SAME AFTER DESCENT THE PULSE OF THE FORMER WAS 94 THERMOMETER UNDER HIS TONGUE AND IN THE HAND 9805 THE PULSE OF THE LATTER WAS 112 THE THERMOMETER UNDER HIS TONGUE 980A5 BOTH ONLY GENTLY PERSPIRING WHAT IS THE INFERENCE FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS DO THEY NOT SEEM TO INDICATE THAT WHILST MODERATE EXERCISE PROMOTES THE DIFFUSION OF TEMPERATURE AND ITS EXALTATION IN THE EXTREMITIES IT AUGMENTS VERY LITTLE IF AT ALL THE HEAT OF THE DEEPSEATED PARTS AND CONSIDERING THE BLOOD AS THE HEATING MEDIUM WARMED ITSELF CHIEFLY BY RESPIRA TION IS NOT THIS WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED REASONING ON THE SUBJECT  BY ACTIVE EXERCISE THE PULSE AND THE RESPIRATION ARE BOTH ACCELERATED MORE OXYGEN IT MAY BE PRESUMED IS CONSUMED MORE HEAT IS GENERATED  THE BLOOD IS MADE TO CIRCULATE MORE RAPIDLY 6364 DR DAVY ON ANIMAL HEAT AND IS SENT IN LARGER QUANTITY INTO THE EXTREMITIES AND WHERE IN CONSEQUENCE THE EX CESS OF HEAT IS CONVEYED AND EXPENDED AND ITS ACCUMULATION IN THE CENTRAL AND DEEP SEATED ORGANS PREVENTED AFFORDING ANOTHER STRIKING EXAMPLE OF HARMONIOUS ADAPTA TION THE SAME THERMOMETER WAS EMPLOYED IN MAKING ALL THE OBSERVATIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER AND IN EVERY INSTANCE IN STATING THE RESULTS ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN MADE FOR ERROR IN ITS GRADUATION CAREFULLY DETERMINED BY COMPARISON WITH A STANDARD INSTRU MENT ONE BELONGING TO PROFESSOR FORBES OF EDINBURGB AND FOR THEUSE OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN INDEBTED TO HIS KINDNESS THE

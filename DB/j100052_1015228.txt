J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1015228,RUSSIA IN THE FABRIC OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE,I242691,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY RUSSIA IN THE FABRIC OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE BY ARTHUR BULLARD DIRECTOR OF THE RUSSIAN DIVISION OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC INFORMATION DURING THE WAR AND SUBSEQUENTLY CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF RUSSIAN AFFAIRS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE N MEETING THE SITUATION IN RUSSIA I HAVE A SUGGESTION I SHOULD LIKE TO OFFER FOR YOUR CONSIDERATIONIN THE SAME WAY THAT NERO USED TO TOSS CHRISTIANS TO HIS LIONS WE CANNOT FORETELL THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN RUSSIA IT MAY BE THAT THE MORE EXTREME COMMUNISTS WILL HOLD THE CONTROL OF THE SOVIETS FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY DO NOT WISH TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE REST OF US IN LESS ENLIGHTENED PARTS OF THE WORLD AS LONG AS THEY ARE IN POWER THE SUGGESTION I WISH TO OFFER IS MEANINGLESS THOSE WHO HAVE RECENTLY BEEN IN RUSSIA TALK OF AN EVOLUTION TOWARDS THE RIGHT THIS IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY PROVIDED LENIN IS ABLE TO WIN SUPPORT FROM AMONG THOSE HE HAS PERSECUTED AND PROSCRIBED HE HAS ALREADY DONE MANY SURPRISING THINGS AND HE MAY BE ABLE TO BUILD UP A POLITICAL MACHINE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE LOYAL TO HIS PER SON THAN TO HIS ORIGINAL THEORIES THE DRIFT TOWARDS THE RIGHT MAY CONTINUE UNTIL THE SOVIETS ARE NO MORE HOSTILE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD THAN ARE THE OCCASIONAL SOCIALIST GOVERNMENTS OF SCANDINAVIA THERE IS ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF A VIOLENT OVERTHROW AND THE ORGANIZATION OF A NEW GOVERNMENT ON THE BASIS OF A DEFINITE BREAK WITH THE COMMUNISTIC TRADITION THOSE WHO HAVE RECENTLY BEEN IN RUSSIA FEEL THAT THIS IS THE LEAST PROBABLE OF THESE THREE POSSI BILITIES BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT WE CAN IGNORE IT THE OLD SWORD MAKERS OF DAMASCUS IN THE DAYS OF THE KHALI PHATE WERE IN THE HABIT OF ITCHING ON THE BLADES THEY MADE THE ARABIC PROVERB WHO DRAWS THE SWORD DIES BY THE SWORD THERE ARE A TREMEN DOUS NUMBER OF BLOOD FEUDS IN RUSSIA SO MANYTHAT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE IN PEACEFUL EVOLUTION HOWEVER DESIR ABLE IT MAY SEEM BY WHICHEVER ROAD EVENTS TRAVEL WE MAY ASSUME THAT SOMETIMEIN THE FULLNESS OF TIMETHERE WILL BE A GOVERN MENT IN RUSSIA WHICH WANTS TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AND WITH WHICH WE SHALL WANT TO DO BUSI NESS I NOW VENTURE A PROPHECY THAT GOVERNMENT WILL BE BROKE THERE WILL BE NO CASH IN THE TREASURY NO INCOME FROM TAXATION NO LARGE IMPORTS ON WHICH TO LEVY TARIFF DUTIES AND WORST OF ALL NO CREDIT SUCH A NEW GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO SPEND MONEY EVEN IF THE ARCH ANGEL GABRIEL SHOULD ACCEPT THE PRE MIERSHIP HE COULD NOT MAINTAIN HIMSELF IN OFFICE WITHOUT FUNDS THE MANIFOLD AMELIORATIONS WHICH WOULD IMMEDI ATELY BE REQUIRED WOULD BE COSTLY SUPPOSE SUCH A GOVERNMENT SHOULD ARISE IN RUSSIA THIS WINTER IT WOULD BE FACED BY THE TREMENDOUS EXPENSES OF FAMINE RELIEFAND THERE IS NO MONEY AT HAND LENIN AND HIS FRIENDS IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THEIR POWER BEFORE HARD TIMES HAD MADE IT FASHIONABLE TO TALK OF GIVING UP THEIR THEORIES AND SWINGING TOWARDS THE RIGHT SET OUT WITH DEFI NITE INTENT AND REMARKABLE SUCCESS TO MAKE DIFFICULT A CAPITALISTIC RESTORA TION THEY WERE NOT NEARLY SO WORRIED OVER A RETURN OF THE TSAR AS THEY WERE BY THE INTRIGUES OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIERS ALL THEIR FINANCIAL DECREES AND POLICIES WERE INTENDED TO ERECT A BARBED WIRE ENTANGLEMENT AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF CAPITALISM THE DILAPIDA TION OF CAPITAL ASSETS THE DISPERSAL OF 10RUSSIA IN THE FABRIC OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE THE NATIONAL GOLD RESERVE THE DISCREDIT WHICH FRANTIC PRINTING PRESSES HAVE CAST ON CURRENCY THE REPUDIATION OF ALL FOREIGN DEBTS HAVE CREATED A SITUA TION OF EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY FOR ANY FUTURE RUSSIAN MINISTER OF FINANCE WHO WISHES TO BRING HIS COUNTRY AGAIN IN TOUCH WITH THE COMMON ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY AVAILABLE CASH A NEW GOVERNMENT IN RUSSIA WILL BE UTTERLY HOPELESS UNLESS IT CAN VERY SPEEDILY GET CREDIT FINANCIALLY RUSSIA IS BANKRUPT BUT LOOKED AT FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW SHE HAS BETTER BASES FOR CREDIT THAN MOST OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES NOW IN OUR DEBT IN COMPARISON BELGIUM FOR INSTANCE IS LIKE A SKILLED ARTISAN WHO HAS A STEADY JOB AND A FIXED INCOME THERE IS A VERY DEFINITE AND LIMITED AMOUNT WHICH HE CAN SAVE OVER THE IMPERATIVE DEMANDS OF CON SUMPTION TO PAY OFF THE DEBTS HE OWES RUSSIA IS LIKE ONE OF OUR FRONTIERSMEN WHO HAS JUST TAKEN OUT A QUARTER SECTION AND WHO BY MERELY CUTTING DOWN THE TREES WILL DOUBLE AND TRIPLE THE VALUE OF HIS LAND AND HAS ALSO A CHANCE TO UNCOVER A GOLD MINE OR STRIKE OIL OUR OWN FINANCIAL HISTORYAFTER THE REVOLUTION AND THE CIVIL WAR SHOWS THAT THE WAY TO PAY OFF DEBTS IS TO OPEN UP NEW AND UNDEVELOPED RE SOURCES IT IS IN TAPPING VIRGIN TERRI TORIES BY DRIVING TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROADS BY OPENING MINES THAT MONEY IS MADE RAPIDLY AND EASILY RUSSIA TODAY IS IN A POSITION VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE BE GINNING OF OUR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT WE HAD A VAST COUNTRY AND CONSIDER ABLE ENERGY BUT WE WERE VERY POOR IT WAS ONLY BY BORROWING HEAVILY FROM EUROPE TO GET THE NECESSARY CAPITAL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SPEED UP OUR IN DUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND GET RICH QUICKLY FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW RUSSIA HAS VERY MUCH BETTER FOUNDA TIONS FOR CREDIT THAN THE MORE HIGHLY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE THEY ARE ALREADY FULLY CAP ITALIZED BUT RUSSIAS EARNING CAPACITY HER ABILITY TO PRODUCE MORE THAN SHE CONSUMES WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY IN CREASED BY WISE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS GRANTED AN EQUALITY IN POLITICAL STA BILITY THE UNDEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE VERY MUCH BETTER BORROWERS THAN THOSE ALREADY CAPITALIZED THIS BRINGS ME TO THE SUGGESTION I WISH TO OFFER FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TONIGHT THE WHOLE FABRIC OF INTER NATIONAL FINANCE IS THREATENED BY THE IMPASSE OF THE INTERALLIED DEBT ANY LARGE SCALE REPUDIATION OR CANCELLATION WOULD BE A DEATH BLOW TO CREDIT IF THE FORMAL PROMISE TO PAY OF GREAT GOVERNMENTS CANNOT BE RELIED UPON WE WILL FIND IT EXCEEDINGLY DIF FICULT TO TRUST EACH OTHER AS INDIVIDUALS BUT WHEN WE BEGIN TO DISCUSS THE PAY MENT OF THESE DEBTS WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE UNFORTUNATE POSITION OF BEING THE PRINCIPAL CREDITOR THE ONLY POS SIBLE WAY FOR THE EUROPEAN NATIONS TO PAY US IS BY EXPORTING TO US THEIR SURPLUS OF MANUFACTURED GOODS TO PAY THEY MUST SEND US MORE THAN THEY TAKE FROM US AND THE PROSPECT IS SO TERRIFYING THAT CONGRESS RUSHES THROUGH AN EMERGENCY TARIFF TO PROTECT OUR OWN INDUSTRIES FROM SUCH DUMPING WE ARE VERY MUCH WORRIED OVER THE FEAR OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE THEORY OF CREDIT IF THEY DO NOT PAY US BUT NOT SO MUCH WORRIED AS WE ARE OVER THE PROSPECT OF DISASTER IF THEY DID PAY US NOW ASSUMING FOR A MOMENT THAT A GOVERNMENT HAS ARISEN IN RUSSIA WHICH INSPIRES CONFIDENCE I SUGGEST THAT THE CONVERSION OF THE PRESENT BILATERAL OBLIGATIONS INTO A THREE CORNER CREDIT ARRANGEMENT MIGHT HELP TO START AGAIN THE WHEELS OF INDUSTRY SUPPOSE THERE IS A FRENCH OBLIGA TION FOR 10000000 DUE TO US ON JANU ARY 1 1923 THE FRENCH CANNOT PAY 11THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EXCEPT IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS WHICH WE DO NOT WANT RUSSIA HOWEVER NEEDS SUCH MANUFACTURED GOODSNEEDS THEM TERRIBLY SUPPOSE WE SELL THAT FRENCH OBLIGATION TO THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR LONGTERM NOTE PAYABLE IN 1953 THE EFFECT WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE STIMULUS TO FRENCH IN DUSTRY BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE FRENCH MANUFACTURERS A CHANCE TO SELL THE PRODUCT OF THEIR FACTORIES FOR DOLLARS IT WOULD AT ONCE GIVE RUSSIA THE PUR CHASING POWER SHE SO VASTLY NEEDS AND AS FAR AS AMERICA IS CONCERNED IT WOULD MEAN RECEIVING A LONGTERM NOTE UNDERWRITTEN AND ENDORSED BY ALL THE UNDEVELOPED WEALTH FROM THE BALTIC TO THE BEHRING SEA IN EXCHANGE FOR A SHORTTERM NOTE WHICH WE CANNOT COLLECT SUPPOSE A FACTORY IN PETROGRAD NEEDS MACHINERY AND ITS AGENTS DISCOVER THAT IT CAN BE PROCURED ON FAVORABLE TERMS IN ENGLAND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ISSUES ITS OBLIGATION IN OUR FAVOR FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OUR TREASURY THEN CREDITS THE BRITISH DEBT ACCOUNT WITH THAT SUM THE RUSSIAN IMPORTER PAYS HIS OWN GOVERNMENT FOR THE PURCHASE IN HIS OWN CURRENCY THE BRITISH EXCHEQUER PAYS THE EXPORTER IN POUNDS STERLING ONCE MORE WE TRADE A SHORTTERM NOTE WHICH COULD BE PAID ONLY IN MANUFACTURED GOODS WHICH WE ARE DETERMINED NOT TO RECEIVE FOR A LONGTERM NOTE WHICH WILL BE PAID IN THE RAW MATERIALS OF RUSSIA MANY OTHER VARIATIONS OF SUCH A SCHEME FOR CREDIT CONVERSION WILL SUG GEST THEMSELVES TO YOU I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS HERE A POSSIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE WHICH WARRANTS CAREFUL CONSIDERATION THE DIFFICULTIES TO BE OVERCOME ARE OBVIOUS BUT AT PRESENT OUR WHOLE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MACHINERY IS STALLED PERHAPS IN RUSSIA OUR IN DUSTRIAL CHAUFFEURS WILL FIND THE IN GREDIENT NECESSARY TO ENRICH THE MIX TURE IN THE CARBURATOR AND START THE ENGINE ONCE MORE

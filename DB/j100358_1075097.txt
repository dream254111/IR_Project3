Overboard By F Marion Crawford Pp 96 Price 50 cents New York The Macmillan Co This charming little story has been enclosed in an equally charming binding and in the popular small size which fits the

This is the kind of naturestudy in which the ordinary boy delights This is the book that every father ought to buy for his boy and which every school ought to have in its library It is on the Robinson

Ethics for Schools and is designed to help in the develop ment of individuals on the moral side The science of ethics is presented in simple language and when used by a judicious teacher it ought to

inter esting account of the application of science to the arts and to daily life It is much nearer life and therefore much more educational than our regular textbooks which in their efforts to be scientific sacrifice style interest and relationship to everyday life The chapter on physics seemed specially alluring after having read some of the weary wastes of some textbook literature Studies and Notes in Philology and Literature Vol VIII Iwain by Arthur C L Brown Arthur and Gorlagen by G L Kittridge Pp 275 Boston Ginn  Co Reserved for review College Course of Shorthand By Francis J Stein Pp I9I Price 125 Philadelphia F J Stein The author announces this as a simplified system of Pitman phonography How We Are Fed By James Franklin Chamberlain Pp ix2I4 Price 40 centg New York The

creation and supply the pupil acquires an insight into the life about him as well as into that of other parts of the world This is a distinctly useful book and is a welcome addition to the literature of the grades It can be profitably used in the early grammar grades In the Guardianship of God By Mrs Flora Steel Pp 357 New York The Macmillan Co These tales of India are full of the interest that has characterized Mrs Steels former works notably On the Face of the Waters A History of France By Arthur Hassall Pp 246 Price 40 cents New York The Macmillan Co We have had occasion more than once to call the attention of our readers to the uniform excellence of the volumes of this series of Temple Primers and to recom mend them as useful supplementary books in our secondary schools This work

is suitable for students who have spent from a year and a half to two years on their German A Selection from the Best English Essays Chosen and arranged by Sher win Cody Pp xliii414 Chicago McClurg  Co M Codys definition of a preface is excellent and the general reader will peruse prefaces if they are as interesting as this The general introduction on the English essay and English prose style is very well planned and this is a useful book for the man of affairs who would in his few leisure moments enjoy the conversation of some cultivated men History of Ancient Education By Samuel G Williams Pp 298 Price 1I2 Syracuse Leo Bardeen This book grew out of the lectures given by the author in Cornell University The difficulty in giving a passing notice to a book of this kind is that one is always tempted to compare it with Lauries classic work on this period This work impresses one as being superficial and is certainly weak in bibliography During the last few years there have been many interesting books upon this period in which the authors have devoted much space to educational and social movements Their researches seem not to have been taken advantage of even though the book bears the imprint of the present year Heroes of Chivalry By Louise Maitland Pp 255 Price 50 cents Chi cago Silver Burdett  Co We are told in the preface that the principle of psychological order has been followed in this series of historical stories so one need have no qualms about the book All the way from myths to altruism one is taken by easy and interesting stages and the stories are told in a manner that will appeal to children The introduction is hardly worthy of the book One does not need to use too simple a language in writing for children An Elementary Physiology and Hygiene By H W Conn Pp 272 Price 60 cents Chicago Silver Burdett  Co The author says that the primary object of the study of physiology in our schools is to inculcate an intelligent care of the body One is willing to accept such a statement if the word inculcate were changed It has a bad history and its deri vation suggests an oldtime pedagogy However this is not a criticism of the book which in aim is certainly on the right path Instead of a separate watertight com partment for the alcohol section the effect of it upon the various functions of the body is treated in direct relation with the particular organs or functions concerned 705THE SCHOOL REVIEW La Mere de la marquise Edited by Murray Peabody Brush Pp v I68 Boston D C Heath  Co The object of the editor of this book is to present a text with vocabulary Suitable for students of French in the second year of the highschool course or in the first year in college Le juif Polonais Edited by Edward Manley Pp xiiiIo8 Boston D C Heath  Co This story has been dramatized and made famous in English by Sir Henry Irving The English version is called The Bells and those who have had the good fortune to see Irving acting the part of the guilty consciencestricken Mathias will not soon forget it This ought to be a welcome addition to the French literature in our schools Ideas of Good and Evil By W B Yeats Pp vii 34I New York The Macmillan Co To characterize these essays as charming seems almost inadequate especially if one should ask what is really meant by that word They have the easyflowing style sometimes even rippling along with the joyousness of the Celtic nature their influ ence is strong but never rude or abrupt and one rises from their perusal refreshed History of Philosophy By Rev William Turner I2mo cloth Pp 674 Price 250 Boston Ginn  Co Nearly onethird of this textbook is devoted to scholastic philosophy This is an admirable feature of the work for the philosophy of the schoolmen has not had adequate treatment in most histories Here the student of education especially of the history of education will find much of interest which has been almost inaccessible and therefore but little noticed in the textbooks on that subject We owe much of our knowledge of that period to the industry and research of professors in our Roman Catholic colleges notably the works of Brother Azarias whose untimely death cut short a career of great educational promise This debt has been added to materially by Mr Turner Essentials of German By B J Vos Pp viii  222 Price 80 cents New York Henry Holt  Co This is an introductory lessonbook written that the beginner may get a thorough mastery of the leading facts and principles of the German language The emphasis is laid upon the practical side of the subject The vocabulary has been carefully chosen so as to include only words of common occurrence It is specially pleasing to note that Mr Vos has intentionally avoided the use of cognates This habit of relating a word in a foreign language to one of similar sound or form in our own language has not only caused confusion but has led many thousands of pupils astray Idyls of the Gass By Martha Wolfenstein Pp 295 Price i New York The Macmillan Co These are tales of Jewish life unique in their language and full of homely interest They depict a phase of social life that many of us know nothing of and therefore have a certain fascination 706BOOK REVIEWS The Merchant of Venice Edited by Thomas Marc Parrott Pp xli  220 Price 50 cents New York Henry Holt  Co The introduction treats of Shakespeares early work of the conspiracy of Dr Lopez of the Jew of Malta of the sources of the play of Shakespeares treatment of the sources and of his characterization Critical explanatory and textual notes with hints for study make up a very interesting treatment of the play Selections from Homers Iliad By Allen Rogers Benner Pp xxvi  522 Price i5o New York D Appleton  Co In this are included the books commonly required for admission to American colleges and in addition liberal selections from the remainder of the poem The editor states that in this work he has attempted to give a just conception of the unity of the Iliad as a work of literature and of art and that this may be the more success fully accomplished he has carefully avoided isolated and incomplete extracts Where it has been undesirable to publish a whole book he has supplied the description of the omitted passages The introduction of some thirtysix pages is well done and shows that the editor appreciates the importance of creating an interesting Grecian atmosphere A table of parallel references a short Homeric grammar a vocabulary a Greek index and an English index are included in this wellbound and well illustrated work Education in Minnesota By David L Kiehle Pp I20  I02 Minneapolis H W Wilson Co This interesting contribution to the history of education in America is divided into two parts the first dealing with the historical aspect the second with the arrange ment of the school laws and the sources of school support Mr Kiehle has not only seen this system of schools develop but he has been an important factor in that development As superintendent of public instruction and as professor of pedagogy in the University of Minnesota he has done much to direct the public policy in educational matters and he therefore speaks as one having accurate and sympathetic knowledge This book is a welcome addition to our literature upon educational development in this country and we hope others as well qualified as he will give us the histories of other states A Descriptive Guide to the Best Fiction By Ernest A Baker Pp 6Io Price 250 New York The Macmillan Co The object of this book is to supply a fairly complete list of the best prose fiction in English with as much description of matter and style for the guidance of readers as can be condensed into a few lines of print for each book This is a very useful book and a real addition to ones library Eskimo Stories By Mary E E Smith Pp I75 Chicago Rand McNally  Co The titlepage of this book with its snow letters and polar bears looks alluring under the July sky which at this writing is living up to its reputation The intro duction by the author is educationally sound but one is inclined to doubt whether the building up of single sentences is the bestway of introducing a child to the knowledge of how to express himself The illustrations are exceptionally well done 707708 THE SCHOOL REVIEW The Theory and Practice of the English Government By Thomas Francis Moran Pp 370 New York Longmans Green  Co The aim of this book is to place before the American readers a concise account of the theory and practice of the English government Liliencrons

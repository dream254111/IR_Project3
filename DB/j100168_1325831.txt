or bylaws some provision empowering a named committee to expel a member for cause Courts 1 Club in this article is used in the sense of an unincorporated club The rules applying to incorporated clubs are of course quite different See CooK ON COR PORATIONS 6 ed  ii and 504 2 See NVERTHEIMERs LAW RELATING TO CLUBS 4 ed p I2572 HARVARD LAW REVIEW of equity will not review the decisions of these committees except in three classes of cases where the rules by virtue of which the expulsion is effected are contrary to natural justice where the proceedings held are not in accordance with the rules where the action of the com mittee is purely malicious3 An unincorporated club is a voluntary association of individuals all rights in which are derived solely from the association not from the law4 On what right of the expelled member then do the courts base their jurisdiction to grant him relief  Some courts assert that their jurisdiction grows out of their power to enforce contracts specifically5 The constitution and bylaws of the club they argue form a contract between the member and the association into which is read a stipulation that the rules will be administered in good faith6 Hence expulsion without compliance with the rules is the violation of a contract and the damages at law being clearly inadequate there may be equitable relief In two aspects this theory is objection able First a contract does not always exist Since the association is not a legal entity and therefore has no capacity to enter into a binding agreement7 the contract if any must be between the incoming and the already admitted members Such a contract is perfectly possible but the relationship can be merely associational not contractual9 Secondly granting the existence of a contract the theory disregards the fact that the contract involves so largely the discretion of the club or its committee that courts should hesitate to enforce it Other courts chiefly English found their jurisdiction on the protection of property rights assert ing that every member has an interest in the club property of which unfair expulsion will unjustly deprive him0 Protection of prop erty rights is a function of equity courts and this theory therefore is sound in so far as true property rights are involved In proprietary 3 These three classes of cases in which courts will interfere were first laid down in Dawkins v Antrobus I7 Ch P 6I5 630 Later cases have laid down the same rule but no case has been found where jurisdiction has been taken for the first or third reasons For jurisdiction based on the protection of property Labouchere v Earl of Wharncliffe I3 Ch D 346 is an example of Q 4 See White v Brownell 2 Daly N Y 329 337 No one has a legal right to membership in such an association See NIBLACK BENEFIT SOCIETIES AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE 2 ed  30 6 See Krause v Saunder I22 N Y Supp 54 55 6 See Blisset v Daniel io Hare 493 522 7 See Steele v Gourley 3 Ti Rep ii9 Creditors must proceed against the club members who incurred the debts See In re London Marine Association L R 8 Eq I76 I95 8 There would seem to be no reason why this word should not be regarded as a correct legal term The meaning which it conveys is certainly well recognized 9 A good example of an association in which there are no contractual ties between the members is a college alumni association The incoming graduate certainly has no thought of contracting with the other graduates He simply enters the organization on the footing of an associate 0 For a good statement of the principle see Rigby v Connol I4 Ch D 482 487 il Injunctions against the unfair expulsion of members of a stock exchange on which the seats are very valuable are therefore properly granted Hutchinson v Lawrence 67 How Prac N Y 38 Also there are real property rights in cases of beneficial insurance associations and insurance lodges And so in disputes between churches or between a church and one of its members equity should take jurisdiction if real property rights are involved Yanthis v Kemp 43 Ind App 203 85 N E 976 Boyles v Roberts 222 Mo 6i3 I2I S W 805NOTES 73 clubs12 no such rights are found and the English courts consistently with their theory refuse relief in such cases3 In members clubs however trustees hold property for the club therefore there is in every member the equitable property right of a cestwi que trust4 Though this right is not a severable one5 and is contingent and defeasible on the members voluntary or involuntary retirement from the club6 it is nevertheless a true property right and the courts properly relieve against a threat ened or consummated expulsion which would illegally deprive the plain tiff of it7 Since however the association has the power to terminate the right for cause and is by the articles of association made the judge of cause the courts adopting the general attitude toward the decisions of quasijudicial tribunals18 should accept the committees bond fide rulings on all questions of construction of the rules or of cause for dis missal A recent English case enjoining expulsion because the court thought that the club rules had not been correctly interpreted and ap plied therefore seems erroneous DArcy v Adamson 57 Sol J 39I Courts should interfere only where the expelling body is not the properly constituted one and where the action is palpably contrary to the letter and the spirit of the articles This indeed is substantially the meaning of the three exceptions mentioned in the beginning of this article They are however vague and artificial and courts would reach better results by dispensing with them and dealing with each case on general principles 12 Clubs in which one man owns the club house and property manages the finances and charges each member regular dues for the use of the premises see WERTHEIMERS LAW RELATING TO CLUBS 4 ed I 13 Baird v Wells 44 Ch D 66i Lyttleton v Blackburn 45 L J Ch 223 14 There is one suggestion that a property right exists even though the club owns no property the idea being that membership alone is a property right See STEVICK UNINCORPORATED SOCIETIES  42 The theory is ingenious and perhaps sound but the law has not yet developed this far See NIBLACK BENEFIT SOCIETIES AND Ac CIDENT INSURANCE  75 16 See McMahon v Raubor 47 N Y 67 70 16 See Lawson v Hewel ii8 Cal 6I3 62I 50 Pac

with its state and government subsidies The early days of that institution gave adequate proof of this and as the years have passed the successful careers of these boys of New York and Cornell have been eloquent testi mony to this aid True for many branches of human knowledge and practise this state ment is eminently applicable to the earlier graduates in the science of geology Dr Prosser whose sudden and unexplained death on September 11 has been widely noticed in the press was one of these country boys Born in 1860 in Columbus a little hamlet of Chenango County N Y the son of a farmer of slight substance and grandson of one of the early settlers of the region the simple sur roundings of his boyhood were of a kind to give unconscious direction to his maturing life His home lay back on the hills which bound the Unadilla River on its way south to join the Susquehanna and its outcropping rocks were filled with things which to his at tentive eye and naturally reflective mind must have awakened many questionings A farmers boy in a stony country where fields have to be picked over regularly after the spring plowing is pretty sure to either love or hate the rocks A disposing mind led this farmers boy to wish to know more about them When the country school a few miles away at Brook field could give him no more he took the helping hand which Cornell held out and entered there in 1879 And it was to be his fortune in after life when fully equipped to return to his home valley and under the auspices of his state geological survey to apply his welltrained mind to the solution of its geological problems So excellently did he habilitate himself in college that after his graduation as bachelor of science in 1883 he received the first award of the Cornell fellow ship in natural history and then for three years was instructor in the department of geology From there he went to Washington as an aid to the late Lester F Ward in the paleobotanical work of the U S Geological Survey It was then I first came to know him while he was engaged in collecting fossil plants and then as always afterwards I found him conscientious and earnest though obvi ously not at that time particularly enthusiastic over the work that had been allotted to him His experience as a teacher seemed to draw him toward that work again and he left Wash ington in 1894 though without dissolving his effective connection with the federal survey to become professor of natural history in Wash burn College Topeka There are active geol ogists today who were his students there but the major result of his stay in Kansas is I SCIENCE 557N S VOL XLIV No 1138 should say the opening it afforded for his re searches on the late paleozoic rocks of that state problems that he followed not only while there but to which he returned in later years His work on the Carboniferous and Permian of Kansas and eastern Nebraska some of it undertaken under the auspices of the Kansas University Geological Survey was of unques tionably high value much of it of funda mental importance But it was his success as a teacher which gave him in 1894 a call to Union University at Schenectady N Y and as it was a call which brought him back home and to the rocks of New York out of which he grew he accepted it with alacrity Union was then venturing on the experiment of establishing a separate department of geology and her experiment was successful enough as some admirable geologists and paleontologists and many other graduates of Union under Prossers regime stand today to testify It was while at Schenectady that Professor Prosser entered upon his alliance with the New York Geological Survey and in this asso ciation accomplished a large amount of useful analytical work on its stratigraphical prob lems His papers published during this pe riod of his life were notable and cover por tions of eastern and central New York the Mohawk Valley and the vicinity of Schenec tady the Helderberg Mountains the Unadilla the Oneonta the Catskill and other regions all characterized by his peculiarly exact and detailed procedure In his last year at Schenectady he was made chief of the Appalachian division of the Mary land geological survey and thereafter for sev eral years his summers were spent in field work on the paleozoic rocks of Maryland Pennsyl vania and West Virginia In 1899 Professor Edward Orton Sr the distinguished state geologist of Ohio former president of the State University educated in Albany and in his later years allied with the official work of New York perceiving the ad vance of the years fastened on Prosser as the man to succeed him in the professorship of geology in the State University of Ohio at Columbus and thither Dr Prosser went as associate professor of historical geology In 1901 he was made head of the department There he remained till his deathseventeen years Professor Orton died not long after Prossers arrival in Columbus and I think the initiate was in some ways embarrassed by the sudden loss of the man who otherwise would have been his wise guide at the begin ning of his new undertaking iFor some time after settling in Columbus Dr Prosser main tained his official and intimate relations with New York but gradually the problems nearer to him invited his attention and a natural loyalty to the state of his adoption and his official connection with its survey together with the requirements of his college work ab sorbed his energies In this period however he was able to give much time and to do much valuable work on the paleozoic rocks of Mary land under the auspices of the official survey of that state now published as a part of the admirable series of reports of that organiza tion Of his many contributions to the geol ogy of Ohio which have been published during his career at Columbus most of them themes of stratigraphic determination and correlation all bear the impress of his cautious mode and detailed analysis which make them practically final for the fields they cover It will be the work of another I trust to set forth adequately the merit of Dr Prossers many contributions to the science of geology and to record the strong uplifting influence he had upon his pupils There stand to his credit men of great worth in this science in American universities who were moulded by his hand but for each one of these trained and proficient men there are scores who have felt the inspiration of his lectures have been uplifted by his unstudied but unfailing cour tesy and thoughtfulness and have been in spired by their association with him in the field His courses at the Ohio State Univer sity had greatly grown in popularity and effi ciency as his students were made to perceive the high cultural value of his science wholly apart from any of its commercial phases But while I am not able fully to speak on this phase of his work except as I have learned 558 SCIENCEOCTOBER 20 1916 it from others I desire to add a few words about the man as I have found him through the acquaintance of many years There never was a more loyal a more de voted a more sensitive spirit His attitude of mind was puritanic in its simplicity and in its practises and left to himself he could never suspect another of indirectness or duplicitya quality of which he contained not a grain When confronted by the broader bearings of his science and the natural se quences of its greater propositions he held himself somewhat carefully aloof it seemed as though the youthful bendings of the twig inclined him away from paths he would not follow Yet this simplicity of heart which would not let him go far afield also made him extraordinarily conscientious in his scientific work It would not be fair to him to say that he had a genius for details but it would be eminently right to assert that he sought inti mately and faithfully for the exact construc tion of every observation he made so far as that had to do with the theme in hand This mental method led him to precision of manner gave him a certain formality which was seldom dismissed under the most informal circum stances Dr Prossers physical address was very pleasing but his natural reticence his precision of thought and his fear of an in exact or loose statement made him a hesitant speaker though a speaker who was always punctiliously guarding a jewel of highest worththe truth Added to this trait which we may well count a virtue was his absolute fealty to first his science then to his friends For those whom he knew to be his friends no sacrifice was too great no defense too vigor ous from them no defection was thinkable The word of personal criticism seldom passed his lips If he had suffered an injustice or an inadequate commentary it was dismissed with a ripple of a deprecating smile as though in pity of himself His determinations of fact he was prepared to defend and to claim his title in them and his highstrung tempera ment made him revolt when he saw the credit for his determinations complacently or in ignorance absorbed by another To this he would not become inured as almost every in vestigator in science must it was to him a rape of his golden fleece Out of the quarry stones of his home land he had laboriously built the house of his desires few know with what struggles against un toward circumstance with what patient tug ging at an unspoken load with which a churl ish fate had saddled him He did build the house of his spirits desire and has left behind many who have seen far enough within its doors to honor his accomplishment lament his sorrows and his unhappy end and to cherish his memory Professor Prosser was buried in the Rural Cemetery at Albany where the members of the New York Geological Survey and representa tives of Union University faculty and corpora tion gathered to pay their last respects to the poor suffocated body which had enshrined so pure a spirit JOHN M CLARKE

LAWS OF OUR COUNTRY BE CHANGED TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR COSMOPOLITAN POPULATION By IRVING E CAMPBELL Richmond Va In discussing the modification of our Sunday laws we must con sider their history and the principles upon which they rest The theory of our Sabbath legislation now generally accepted by our courts is an element of jurisprudence pecularly our own From the time of Constantine to the formation of the American Republic these statutes bore the sanction of religious obligation as well as of civil duty and the Sabbath was therein classed with the other feast days of the church This was the natural outcome of the union of church and state There seems to have been but one exception during this time which is found in the laws of Rhode Island Colony under Roger Williams  But upon the establishment of our present government with its religious freedom and separa tion of the ecclesiastical from the civil authority these laws were so modified as to make rest rather than religion their chief aim and the church days other than Sunday were dropped from the statutes as were other religious requirements These laws which long existed as Christian institutions are now construed to be but economic regulations for the civil welfare of the people It is dif ficult however to follow this theory to its ultimate conclusions without violating that very religious freedom which it endeavors to maintain Judge Cooley says It appears to us that if the bene fit to the individual is alone to be considered the argument against the law which he may make who already observed the seventh day of the week is unaonswerable The fact is that perfect freedom of religious practice is as im possible in this country as is perfect civil liberty Each must be exercised with reference to the rights of our neighbor and where there is conflict the wishes of the majority must govern So the Christian sentimient of the great majority of our people must in this matter prevail And there is high authority for the proposi I Con Lim 4771904 SHOULD OUR SUNDAY LAWS BE CHANGED 683 tion that there is in these laws an element of Christianity as well as economics Mr Justice Story the most scholarly judge which our country has produced declares Probably at the time of the adoption of the constitution and the amendment now under consideration the first amendment the general if not the universal sentiment in America was that Christianity ought to receive encouragement from the state so far as was not incompatible with the private rights of conscience and the freedom of religious worship An attempt to level all religions and to make it a matter of state policy to hold all in utter indifference would have created universl disapprobation if not universal indignation Again the same learned justice says The real object of the amendment was not to countenance much less to advance Mahometanism or Judaism or infidelity by prostrating Christianity but to exclude all rivalry among Chris tian sects and to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment which would give to a hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government2 It is observed by an appellate court of Missouri that justification of Sunday laws on economic grounds was an afterthought of the courts3 That Christianity constitutes an element of our jurisprudence can scarcely be denied when the Supreme Court of the land after a full consideration of this question in the Holy Trinity Church Case holds in a unanimous opinion that this is a Christiam notion Daniel Webster in his argument before the Supreme Court in the Girard Case uses this language There is nothing which we look for with more certainty than this general principle that Chris tianity is part of the law of the land   Where there is a religious sentiment amongst men at all this sentiment incorporates itself with the law Everything declares it The massive cathedral of the Catholic the Episcopalian church with its lofty spire pointing heavenward the plain temple of the Quaker the log church of the hardy pioneer of the wilderness the mementoes and memorials around and about us the consecrated graveyards their

ChristianityChristianity independent of sects and paxties that Christianity to which the sword and fagot are unknowngeneral tolerant Christianityis the law of the land Whatever may have been the grounds of the decisions of our courts these Sunday laws have been upheld and are now firmly established as constitutional and valid Any modification there fore must come from the legislative and not the judicial branch of government Should the demands of our cosmopolitan population for more liberal Sunday legislation be granted In the worlds destiny the American continent was reserved that here a nation might begin its career with an advanced development in matters civil and religious untrammelled by custom and un hampered by tradition To this country our forefathers came not so much to bring the institutions of their home states as is usually done by peoples occupying new territory as to get away from those institutions Here they established a new order of things the re sult of which has been a great nation to which the eyes of all the world now turn as the leader in constitutional government and per sonal libertyr And the same spirit which animated the founders of our nation continues to bring those of all nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues to our shores They come seeking a new and better country They would find the freedom protection and prosperity of institutions peculiarly American WVhy then should we be asked to alter for their benefit these institutions to make them conform to the conditions which they have left and the re sults of which they have endeavored to escape No one would con tend that this should be done in the form of our government or that we should abolish the observance of our patriotic days at their demand lVhy therefore should this be done with the American Sabbath which has been a recognized institution of this country from its inception It is said that the first law ever passed here was for the observance of Sundayan enactment of the Virginia Colony in 1617 three years before the Pilgrims landed at Ply mouth Our foreign element constitutes a comparatively small proportion1904 SHOULD OUR SUNDAY LAWS BE CHANGED 685 of our population Why therefore should they determine our policy Moreover this demand we think does not come from the better element of this minority Bishop Potter has said It is as utter impertinence for the German or the Frenchman for the Jew or the Mohlammedan to come here demanding that we should waive the customs and repeal the laws that hallow our Lords day as that we should surrender our language for the dialect of the Black Forest or our marriage relations for the domestic usages of the Sultan We do not want nor should we encourage a cosmopolitan popu lation We welcome all good citizens to our hospitable shores and we do not ask that they forget the homes of their nativity but we wish them to cast in their lot with us as Americans when they abide with us upon American soil Let us not however be blinded by national plide which goeth before destruction Let us gather what of good we may from the experiences of other peoples but let us adopt it because of no demand save that of wisdom and experience Is there anything in the experience of the nations which have a hol iday andl workday Sabbath or in the conditions which it fosters which would lead us to emulate their example We think not If we must learn from other peoples let us take our lessons from Lon don from Edinburgh or from Toronto rather than from Paris Berlin or Rome Are our Sunday laws wise and beneficent and promotive of the best interests of our people If so surely they sould not be chang ed That a weekly restday is needful to our highest development and to our welfare and happiness our individual experiences should be enough to convince IIs And when we likewise find in the ut terances of our statesmen our philosophers and ouLr judges this same great principle we cannot doubt its truth and wisdom It may be said that the demand is for amuLsement rather thail work on the Sabbath day But the result is the same for where one is entertainied by public amusement some one is at work to fur nish that amusement And where the observance of the day is broken by such amusements other labor soon follows as the expe riences of other nations teach us The laboring man who demands his public amusement on the Sabbath day forgets that on principle and experience a workday must follow For what reason or justice is there in allowing the proprietor of public amusements or the686 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec seller of luxuries to pursue their callings for gain on this day while the owner of the factory and the vendor of the necessaries of life are required to close their places of business Mr Justice Field when upon the Supreme Court bench of Cali fornia in a dissenting opinion which was afterwards adopted as the opinion of that court speaking of the Sunday law then in force in that state uses this language which has been twice quoted with approval by the Supremle Court of the Unitcd States Its requirement is a cessation from labor In its enactment the legislature has given the sanction of law to a rule of conduct which the entire civilized world recognizes as essential to the physical and moral wellbeing of society Upon no subject is thero such a con currence of opinion among philosophers moralists and statesmen of all nations as on the necessity of periodical cessation from labor One day in seven is the rule founded in experience and sustained by science    The prohibition of secular business on Sun day is advocated on the ground that by it the general welfare is advanced labor protected and the moral and physical wellbeing of society promoted4 Mr Justice Strong observes The first settlers of this country were a body of select men They were profoundly impressed by the conviction that a weekly Sabbath was essential to the highest welfare of the communities which they established and they there fore enacted laws to enforce a proper observance of that day The Sabbath so observed no one can doubt contributed largely to the formation of that character which has stood us in so much stead in our ownhistory and which has been the admiration of the world MIr Blackstone says of the Sabbath that corruption of morality usually follows its profanation  that it is of admirable service to a state considered merely as a civil institution AMr Gladstone declares I have myself in the course of a laborious life signally experienced both its mental and physical benefits I can hardly overstate its value in this view and for the interest of the working men of this country alike in these and in other yet higher respects

ruined Humbolt the German naturalist declares It is as unreason able as inhuman to work beyond six days weekly The Supreme Court of Georgia uses the following language which is quoted with approval by the Supreme Court of the United States Leisure is no less essential than labor to the wellbeing of man Short intervals of leisure at stated periods reduce wear and tear promote health favor cleanliness encourage social intercourse afford opportunity for introspection and retrospection and tend in a high degree to expand the thoughts and sympathies of people en large their information and elevate their morals They learn how to be and come to realize that being is quite as important as do ing5 Dr Crafts in his work The Sabbath for Man after a discus sion of the Sabbath laws with reference to personal liberty con cludes that such statutes are consistent with liberty in that they are laws for the prevention of cruelty to animals for the preserva tion of health for increasing the national wealth for harmonizing the relations of capital and labor for the protection of the home for the prevention of crime for the protection of one of the chief historic institutions of the nation in that they are in short laws of national selfpreservation Dr Lewis in his book on Sunday Legislation contends that rest on Sunday should be permissive and not compulsory In regard to this theory Mir Justice Field says The position as sumes that all men are independent and at liberty to work when ever they choose Whether this is true or not in theory it is false in fact it is contradicted by every days experience Testimony from such sources as these can leave no doubt as to the wisdom and beneficence ol our legislation to secure to our peo ple a weekly day of rest and that

everything The body must have rest from labor and the mind relief from care And so closely is the moral nature allied to the physical that it is more susceptible to evil influence when not supported by a strong physique and a vigorous mind Instead of heeding the demand for more activity we should rather harken unto the cry of tired humanity Oh that I had wings like a dove for then would I fly away and be at rest And is not nmans higher moral nature worthy of some consider ation at the hands of the nation Character is the foundation of national as welt as individual stability Is there to be no time set apart to cultivate what is best in man The development of char acter requires meditation as well as aetivity Our own consciousness teaches us that there is within us some thing belonging

manhoodand better citizenship In the making and maintaining of a nation is not this element of mans nature to be taken into account and a time given for its development Whether there is a religious element in our Sunday laws or not religion is by no means foreign to our jurisprudence Under our institutions it is not conceived that a man should enter upon the duties of a high public trust without an appeal to God to witness the faithful discharge of the obligations of his office Witnesses in our courts of justice must needs qualify themselves by an oath be fore the Supreme Being the dispenser of retributions and rewvards that they may truly testify in the affairs between man and mnan Are there higher functions of citizenship than these And is the state to take Ino thought and exercise no control in preparing its citizens for the discharge of these sacred obligations which it exacts of them Who will say that the state is not competent to designate a time in which man may be encouraged to the attainment of a proper realization of his relationship to God when upon that con ception rests the very official life of our nation and the due admin istration of our laws If such an appreciation of mans responsi bility to God is necessarfy to the exercise of these highest functions1904 SHOULD OUR SUNDAY LAWS BE CHANGED 689 of citizenship can it be otherwise than beneficial in all of the rela tionships of life Mirabeau uttered this great truth when he said God is as necessary as liberty to the French people If what we have said is true and it must be true it would seem to follow that the Fourth Commandmeit of the Decalogue both as a religious injunction turning man to God and as an economic statute requiring rest from toil has as much place in our civil law as have the Sixth Seventh Eighth and Ninth Commandments Washington said Reason and experience both forbid us to ex pect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle UJnder no conditions can man comprehend so well something of individual responsibility to Godwhich Webster calls the great est thoughtas amid the calm of a quiet restful day or when tempted by inviting bells to the house of God or when summoned by the call to morning or evening prayer or when constrained by the law written in the Gentile heart or portrayed in natures book to the worship of the Great Creator by whatever name he may be known or perchance to offer sacrifice at the altar of The Unknown God for even such homage is not without its effect upon human conduct Let us preserve such a day for the refreshing for the upbuilding and for the perfecting of the citizen in mind in body and in spirit Let us not in these latter times in the pride of our national strength or at the behest of the stranger within our gates remove this ancient landmark which our fathers have set but rather let us wvhatever be our faith unite in this petition to the God of our civil law upon whom we as a nation

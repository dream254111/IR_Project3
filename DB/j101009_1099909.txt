LAWS OF OUR COUNTRY BE CHANGED TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR COSMOPOLITAN POPULATION BY IRVING E CAMPBELL RICHMOND VA IN DISCUSSING THE MODIFICATION OF OUR SUNDAY LAWS WE MUST CON SIDER THEIR HISTORY AND THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THEY REST THE THEORY OF OUR SABBATH LEGISLATION NOW GENERALLY ACCEPTED BY OUR COURTS IS AN ELEMENT OF JURISPRUDENCE PECULARLY OUR OWN FROM THE TIME OF CONSTANTINE TO THE FORMATION OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC THESE STATUTES BORE THE SANCTION OF RELIGIOUS OBLIGATION AS WELL AS OF CIVIL DUTY AND THE SABBATH WAS THEREIN CLASSED WITH THE OTHER FEAST DAYS OF THE CHURCH THIS WAS THE NATURAL OUTCOME OF THE UNION OF CHURCH AND STATE THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BUT ONE EXCEPTION DURING THIS TIME WHICH IS FOUND IN THE LAWS OF RHODE ISLAND COLONY UNDER ROGER WILLIAMS  BUT UPON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR PRESENT GOVERNMENT WITH ITS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND SEPARA TION OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL FROM THE CIVIL AUTHORITY THESE LAWS WERE SO MODIFIED AS TO MAKE REST RATHER THAN RELIGION THEIR CHIEF AIM AND THE CHURCH DAYS OTHER THAN SUNDAY WERE DROPPED FROM THE STATUTES AS WERE OTHER RELIGIOUS REQUIREMENTS THESE LAWS WHICH LONG EXISTED AS CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS ARE NOW CONSTRUED TO BE BUT ECONOMIC REGULATIONS FOR THE CIVIL WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE IT IS DIF FICULT HOWEVER TO FOLLOW THIS THEORY TO ITS ULTIMATE CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT VIOLATING THAT VERY RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WHICH IT ENDEAVORS TO MAINTAIN JUDGE COOLEY SAYS IT APPEARS TO US THAT IF THE BENE FIT TO THE INDIVIDUAL IS ALONE TO BE CONSIDERED THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THE LAW WHICH HE MAY MAKE WHO ALREADY OBSERVED THE SEVENTH DAY OF THE WEEK IS UNAONSWERABLE THE FACT IS THAT PERFECT FREEDOM OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE IS AS IM POSSIBLE IN THIS COUNTRY AS IS PERFECT CIVIL LIBERTY EACH MUST BE EXERCISED WITH REFERENCE TO THE RIGHTS OF OUR NEIGHBOR AND WHERE THERE IS CONFLICT THE WISHES OF THE MAJORITY MUST GOVERN SO THE CHRISTIAN SENTIMIENT OF THE GREAT MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE MUST IN THIS MATTER PREVAIL AND THERE IS HIGH AUTHORITY FOR THE PROPOSI I CON LIM 4771904 SHOULD OUR SUNDAY LAWS BE CHANGED 683 TION THAT THERE IS IN THESE LAWS AN ELEMENT OF CHRISTIANITY AS WELL AS ECONOMICS MR JUSTICE STORY THE MOST SCHOLARLY JUDGE WHICH OUR COUNTRY HAS PRODUCED DECLARES PROBABLY AT THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE AMENDMENT NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION THE FIRST AMENDMENT THE GENERAL IF NOT THE UNIVERSAL SENTIMENT IN AMERICA WAS THAT CHRISTIANITY OUGHT TO RECEIVE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE STATE SO FAR AS WAS NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE AND THE FREEDOM OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AN ATTEMPT TO LEVEL ALL RELIGIONS AND TO MAKE IT A MATTER OF STATE POLICY TO HOLD ALL IN UTTER INDIFFERENCE WOULD HAVE CREATED UNIVERSL DISAPPROBATION IF NOT UNIVERSAL INDIGNATION AGAIN THE SAME LEARNED JUSTICE SAYS THE REAL OBJECT OF THE AMENDMENT WAS NOT TO COUNTENANCE MUCH LESS TO ADVANCE MAHOMETANISM OR JUDAISM OR INFIDELITY BY PROSTRATING CHRISTIANITY BUT TO EXCLUDE ALL RIVALRY AMONG CHRIS TIAN SECTS AND TO PREVENT ANY NATIONAL ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WOULD GIVE TO A HIERARCHY THE EXCLUSIVE PATRONAGE OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT2 IT IS OBSERVED BY AN APPELLATE COURT OF MISSOURI THAT JUSTIFICATION OF SUNDAY LAWS ON ECONOMIC GROUNDS WAS AN AFTERTHOUGHT OF THE COURTS3 THAT CHRISTIANITY CONSTITUTES AN ELEMENT OF OUR JURISPRUDENCE CAN SCARCELY BE DENIED WHEN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE LAND AFTER A FULL CONSIDERATION OF THIS QUESTION IN THE HOLY TRINITY CHURCH CASE HOLDS IN A UNANIMOUS OPINION THAT THIS IS A CHRISTIAM NOTION DANIEL WEBSTER IN HIS ARGUMENT BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT IN THE GIRARD CASE USES THIS LANGUAGE THERE IS NOTHING WHICH WE LOOK FOR WITH MORE CERTAINTY THAN THIS GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT CHRIS TIANITY IS PART OF THE LAW OF THE LAND   WHERE THERE IS A RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT AMONGST MEN AT ALL THIS SENTIMENT INCORPORATES ITSELF WITH THE LAW EVERYTHING DECLARES IT THE MASSIVE CATHEDRAL OF THE CATHOLIC THE EPISCOPALIAN CHURCH WITH ITS LOFTY

THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD THE DEMANDS OF OUR COSMOPOLITAN POPULATION FOR MORE LIBERAL SUNDAY LEGISLATION BE GRANTED IN THE WORLDS DESTINY THE AMERICAN CONTINENT WAS RESERVED THAT HERE A NATION MIGHT BEGIN ITS CAREER WITH AN ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT IN MATTERS CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS UNTRAMMELLED BY CUSTOM AND UN HAMPERED BY TRADITION TO THIS COUNTRY OUR FOREFATHERS CAME NOT SO MUCH TO BRING

CONTINUES TO BRING THOSE OF ALL NATIONS AND KINDREDS AND PEOPLES AND TONGUES TO OUR SHORES THEY COME SEEKING A NEW AND BETTER COUNTRY THEY WOULD FIND THE FREEDOM PROTECTION AND PROSPERITY OF

HAVE ENDEAVORED TO ESCAPE NO ONE WOULD CON TEND THAT THIS SHOULD BE DONE IN THE FORM OF OUR GOVERNMENT OR THAT WE SHOULD ABOLISH THE OBSERVANCE OF OUR PATRIOTIC DAYS AT THEIR DEMAND LVHY THEREFORE SHOULD THIS BE DONE WITH THE AMERICAN SABBATH WHICH HAS BEEN A RECOGNIZED INSTITUTION OF THIS COUNTRY FROM ITS INCEPTION IT IS SAID THAT THE FIRST LAW EVER PASSED HERE WAS FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF

IMPERTINENCE FOR THE GERMAN OR THE FRENCHMAN FOR THE JEW OR THE MOHLAMMEDAN TO COME HERE DEMANDING THAT WE SHOULD WAIVE THE CUSTOMS AND REPEAL THE LAWS THAT HALLOW OUR LORDS DAY AS THAT WE SHOULD SURRENDER OUR LANGUAGE FOR THE DIALECT OF THE BLACK FOREST OR OUR MARRIAGE RELATIONS FOR THE DOMESTIC USAGES OF THE SULTAN WE DO NOT WANT NOR SHOULD WE ENCOURAGE A COSMOPOLITAN POPU LATION WE WELCOME

WISE AND BENEFICENT AND PROMOTIVE OF THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR PEOPLE IF SO SURELY THEY SOULD NOT BE CHANG ED THAT A WEEKLY RESTDAY IS NEEDFUL TO OUR HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT AND TO OUR WELFARE AND HAPPINESS OUR INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE IIS AND WHEN WE LIKEWISE FIND IN THE UT TERANCES OF OUR STATESMEN OUR PHILOSOPHERS AND OULR JUDGES THIS SAME GREAT PRINCIPLE WE CANNOT DOUBT ITS TRUTH AND WISDOM IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE DEMAND IS FOR AMULSEMENT RATHER THAIL WORK ON THE SABBATH DAY BUT THE RESULT IS THE SAME FOR WHERE ONE IS ENTERTAINIED BY PUBLIC AMUSEMENT SOME ONE IS AT WORK TO FUR NISH THAT AMUSEMENT AND WHERE THE OBSERVANCE OF THE DAY IS BROKEN BY SUCH AMUSEMENTS OTHER LABOR SOON FOLLOWS AS THE EXPE RIENCES OF OTHER NATIONS TEACH US THE LABORING MAN WHO

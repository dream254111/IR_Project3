J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074636,THE HIGH SCHOOL COURSE IN CHEMISTRY,I244498,THE SCHOOL REVIEW A JOURNAL OF SECONDARY EDUCATION VOLUME V OCTOBER I87 WHOLE NUMBER 8 LTOIB 1I9 7 NUMBER 48 THE HIGH SCHOOL COURSE IN CHEMISTRY THE STUDY OF CHEMISTRY IS A VALUABLE CONSTITUENT OF THE HIGH SCHOOL COURSE ON ACCOUNT I OF THE FIRSTHAND INFORMATION WHICH IT GIVES ABOUT WELLKNOWN MATERIALS THE PRINCIPLES OF THEIR MAN UFACTURE AND THEIR PROPERTIES AS THE RESULT OF PERSONAL OBSERVA TION AND 2 OF THE TRAINING IN OBSERVATION IN GENERAL AND CORRECT INDUCTION FROM OBSERVATION WHICH IT AFFORDS WITHOUT LABORA TORY WORK IT IS ALMOST WHOLLY VALUELESS FOR THESE PURPOSES IT SHOULD BE PRECEDED BY PHYSICS SINCE CHEMISTRY NECESSARILY ASSUMES A KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER AND OF THE PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH HEAT AND ELECTRICITY IF ON ACCOUNT OF LIMITED TEACHING FORCE RELATIVELY LITTLE TIME CAN BE GIVEN TO THE SCIENCES IT IS PREFERABLE AS THE  COMMITTEE OF TEN  ADVISE TO GIVE A YEAR EACH TO ONE OR TWO SCIENCES THAN SHORTER PERIODS TO A LARGER NUMBER IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT FOR THE EFFICIENT TEACHING OF SCIENCE PREPARATION OF APPARATUS AND EXPERIMENTS FOR DEMONSTRATIONS AND LABORATORY WORK ARE NECES SARY AND THE SCIENCE TEACHER CANNOT THEREFORE CARRY MORE THAN HALF THE NUMBER OF RECITATIONS ASSIGNED TO MOST OTHER TEACHERS I TIMETHE WORK OUTLINED BELOW WILL DEMAND AT LEAST 200 HOURS WORK ABOUT HALF THE TIME IN TWOHOUR PERIODS SHOULD BE SPENT IN THE LABORATORY 2 METHODS OF TEACHINGTO MAKE THE STUDY OF ANY VALUE PREPARED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 497THE SCHOOL REVIEW PERSONAL OBSERVATION IN THE LABORATORY MUST BE FOLLOWED BY THOROUGH DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN CLASS LABORATORY WORKTHE EXPERIMENTS MUST BE PERFORMED BY EACH PUPIL INDIVIDUALLY EACH PUPIL MUST RECORD HIS OBSERVATIONS AND THE INTERPRETA TION OF THEM IN A NOTEBOOK HIS WORK SHOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY SUPERVISED AND HIS RECORDS FREQUENTLY EXAMINED BY THE TEACHER MOST PUPILS WILL TEND TO FALL INTO MERELY MECHANICAL PER FORMANCE OF ASSIGNED WORK TO COMBAT THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT TASK OF THE TEACHER OF CHEMISTRY EACH EXPERIMENT IS A QUESTION PUT TO NATURE AND FORETHOUGHT AND CARE ARE NECESSARY IN PUTTING THE QUESTION AND STUDY AND REFLECTION IN INTERPRETING THE ANSWER STRENUOUS EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE THE PUPIL REALIZE THIS BEGINNING AT AN EARLY STAGE IN THE COURSE SIMPLE QUANTITATIVE EXPERIMENTS SHOULD BE GIVEN IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THE LAWS OF DEFINITE AND MULTIPLE PROPORTION THE DETERMINATION OF COMBINING WEIGHTS THE SP GR OF GASES ETC THIS WILL ENABLE THE PUPIL TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT ALTHOUGH THE QUANTITIES USED IN THE MAJORITY OF LABORATORY EXERCISES MAY NOT BE MEASURED YET THE QUANTITIES OF MATTER INVOLVED IN ALL CHEMICAL CHANGES ARE DEFINITE AND MEASURABLE WITHOUT SUCH MEASUREMENTS THE LAW OF DEFINITE PROPORTIONS CANNOT BE REALLY GRASPED AND WILL SOON BE FORGOTTEN AND ATOMIC WEIGHTS WILL SEEM PURELY MYTHICAL NOT LESS THAN SIX SUCH EXERCISES SHOULD BE GIVEN ONE OR TWO OF THESE EXPERIMENTS MUST BE INTRODUCED EARLY IN ORDER THAT FORMULAE AND EQUATIONS WHEN THE TIME FOR THEIR EMPLOY MENT COMES MAY BE GIVEN AS ABBREVIATED EXPRESSIONS OF THE RESULTS OF QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS THE PUPIL MUST NEVER SEEK INFORMATION BY CONSTRUCTING AN EQUATION OBSERVATION IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND THE EQUATION SIMPLY EXPRESSES THE QUANTITATIVE RELATIONS OBSERVED ALL EXERCISES IN WRITING EQUATIONS AND RULES FOR CONSTRUCTING THEM AS IF THEY WERE MATH EMATICAL EXPRESSIONS MUST BE RIGIDLY EXCLUDED QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS A BRANCH OF APPLIED CHEMISTRY AND CANNOT BE LEARNED OTHERWISE THAN MECHANICALLY WITHOUT A LONG PREPARATION IN GENERAL CHEMISTRY THERE SHOULD BE NO PRETENSE 498THE HIGH SCHOOL COURSE IN CHESAITRY OF TEACHING IT IN A SECONDARY SCHOOL AS PART MUCH LESS AS THE WHOLE OF THE FIRST YEARS WORK IT GIVES A DISTORTED VIEW OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ELEMENTS AND OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR PROPERTIES AND BEARS THE SAME RELATION TO THE SCIENCE OF CHEMISTRY THAT THE LINNEAN SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION IN BOTANY BEARS TO THE NATURAL YET EXERCISES ON THE RECOGNITION OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES WILL TEND TO FIX THEIR PROPERTIES IN THE MIND AND GIVE A USEFUL REVIEW OF MANY OF THE FACTS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE PROVIDED THAT A PROPER METHOD OF CONDUCTING THEM BE PURSUED ANALYTICAL TABLES ENCOURAGE MECHANICAL WORK IN A REMARKABLE DEGREE AND CANNOT BE PERMITTED AN OUTLINE SUGGESTING SUITABLE DRY AND WETWAY EXPERIMENTS WHICH WILL THROW THE BURDEN OF THOUGHT AND RIGID PROOF ON THE PUPIL WILL BE A SUFFICIENT GUIDE THIS PART OF THE WORK MAY FITLY OCCUPY FIVE OR SIX WEEKS OF THE COURSE DEMONSTRATIONSMANY PARTS OF THE SUBJECT CAN BEST BE INTRODUCED BY MEANS OF CAREFULLY REASONED AND FULLY ILLUSTRATED DEMONSTRATIONS BY THE TEACHER SOMETIMES ALSO THIS METHOD OF TEACHING HAS TO BE USED WHERE THE APPARATUS IS COMPLICATED AND CANNOT BE SUPPLIED TO EACH PUPIL OR WHERE IN STRIVING TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT SUCCESSFUL THE PUPIL WILL BE IN DANGER OF WASTING TIME THUS ON PEDAGOGICAL OR PRACTICAL GROUNDS MANY OF THE HOFMANN EXPERIMENTS FOR ILLUSTRATING GAY LUSSACS LAW OF VOL UMES EXPLOSION OF HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN ELECTROLYSIS OF HYDRO CHLORIC ACID ETC ARE BEST PERFORMED BY THE TEACHER LIBRARYINTEREST IN THE STUDY SHOULD BE FOSTERED BY PROVID ING A SMALLLIBRARY THE USE OF THIS WILL COUNTERACT THE IDEA WHICH THE PUPIL MAY POSSIBLY RECEIVE THAT THE TEXTBOOK EMPLOYED IN THE CLASS IS A COMPLETE TREATISE IT SHOULD CONTAIN SOME MORE ADVANCED WORKS AS WELL AS SOME OF A MORE POPULAR NATURE 3 SUBJECTMATTERTHE FOLLOWING OUTLINE INCLUDES ONLY THE INDISPENSABLE THINGS WHICH MUST BE STUDIED IN THE CLASS ROOM AND LABORATORY THE MATERIAL IS FOR THE MOST PART COMMON TO ALL ELEMENTARY TEXTBOOKS AND LABORATORY MANUALS EACH BOOK MAKES ITS OWN SELECTION OF FACTS BEYOND THIS WHICH MAY BE NECES SARY FOR THE ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE THE GEN 499THE SCHOOL

WHICH ARE EXPENSIVE OR ARE LESS FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED MAY BE KEPT IN THE LABORATORY FOR COMMON USE OF THIS NATURE ARE MOST OF THE ARTICLES REQUIRED FOR QUANTITATIVE EXPERIMENTS DETAILED LISTS OF APPARATUS AND CHEMICALS WILL BE FOUND IN REMSENS BRIEFER COURSE AND OTHER TEXTS IN VIEW OF THE PREVAILING IDEA THAT QUANTITATIVE EXPERIMENTS REQUIRE EXPENSIVE APPARATUS IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT A BALANCE COSTING I250AND WEIGHTS 125 WILL AMPLY SUFFICE AND EFFICIENT WORK IS BEING DONE IN SOME SCHOOLS WITH ORDINARY HAND SCALES COSTING LESS THAN 150 THERE SHOULD BE ONE BALANCE TO EVERY SIX PUPILS

j100011,Biological Bulletin,1536251,Sperm Agglutination and Fertilization,i268343,SPERM AGGLUTINATION AND FERTILIZATION FRANK R LILLIE In a recent paper on Cluster Formation of Spermatozoa Caused by Specific Substances From Eggs Loeb I4 has pre sented a criticism of my theory of fertilization Lillie 13b and 14 based on observation of the California seaurchin Stron gylocentrotus purpuratus My own observations were made on Arbacia punctulata of Massachusetts and it would appear that part at least of Loebs criticism was due to certain differences in the two forms for he has now stated Loeb I914b p 318 foot note that the cluster formation of the spermatozoa may find its explanation on the assumption of an agglutination at least in the case of Arbacia as I maintained it is therefore not a tropistic reaction as he thought probable from his observa tions in California This was one of the chief differences of opinion A second one was in regard to the source and sig nificance of the substance in the fluid of egg suspensions that caused such agglutination Loeb maintained that it was merely the dissolved chorion i e jelly layer of the egg and that after this was removed the eggs no longer produced the agglutinating sulstance and yet were capable of fertilization whereas my contention was that the agglutinating substance was a secretion of the egg soaked up by the jelly as by a sponge that the eggs produced it for a certain length of time after the removal of the jelly and lost their power of fertilization after they ceased to produce it These criticisms cut at the foundation of my theory Inas much as the correction of the tropistic interpretation of agglutin ation is given only in a footnote to another paper and no cor rection of the source of the agglutinating substance has yet appeared it is incumbent on me to consider the criticisms carefully at the same time I wish to take the opportunity to explain certain points that appear to be open to misinterpretation and to record some new observations 18SPERM AGGLUTINATION AND FERTILIZATION I  CLUSTERFORMATION VERSUS AGGLUTINATION The phenomena exhibited by sperm suspensions of Arbacia with which we have to deal are of four distinct types which it is essential to distinguish sharply I activation 2 aggregation 3 agglutination 4 masscoagulation I That the activity of spermatozoa is affected by substances in the seawater requires no argument The subject is discussed in study V Lille I913a pp 519532 2 Aggregation of spermatozoa may be brought about by tropistic reactions In my paper on the Behavior of Spermatozoa I devoted a great deal of attention to such aggregation phenomena and the distinction from phenomena of agglutination 1913 pp 532548 and pp 551552 Among other things I pointed out that aggregation as a tropistic phe nomenon implies a gradient2 and that the spermatozoa never adhere however crowded they may be there is no observable physical change of the spermatozoa and the slightest agitation suffices to disperse them again Such tropistic phenomena may be exhibited in response to CO2 and other acids Nereis or certain constituents of egg secretions to mention only chemotaxis 3 Agglutination of spermatozoa on the other hand requires no gradient and the spermatozoa adhere physically to such an extent that the agglutinated masses may be preserved intact in killing fluids its degree is a function of the concentration of the agglutinating medium and is also different in different species Agglutination is nontoxic not limiting the life of the sper matozoa it is reversible its duration depending on the concen tration of the agglutinating medium it cannot be repeated if the reaction is complete at least within the time limits of my ex periments even though the spermatozoa remain motile3 finally motility of the spermatozoa is a prerequisite to a decided reac 1 The reaction here referred to is a lethal phenomenon It possibly involves cytolysis with subsequent adhesion of the spermatozoa 2 It is important to notice that the spermatozoa of suspensions may produce gradients through their own activities Thus I pointed out that autogenous aggre gation reactions in sperm suspensions of Nereis arise from the positive chemotaxis of the spermatozoa to their excreted C02 giving rise to very striking phenomena Lillie 1913a pp 519521 and pp 538540 It is conceivable that such a tro pistic phenomena is involved as a part factor in the agglutination phenomena under discussion 3 Glaser I914 also comes to this conclusion I9FRANK R LILLIE tion evidently because the physical change on which the reaction depends is not sufficient to cause adhesion except when the spermatozoa positively collide1 These six criteria definitely define the phenomenon Agglutination is positively distinct from aggregation It is an entirely different biological phenomenon The two may however be exhibited simultaneously as when a drop of egg secretion of Arbacia is injected into a sperm suspension of the species In such a case the spermatozoa exhibit positive chemo taxis to one constituent of the egg secretion and are agglutinated by another the fertilizin The separateness of these two sub stances was maintained in my first publication on the subject and demonstrated by repeated experiments see Lillie I913a p 549 and 1914 pp 545546 4 The phenomenon of masscoagulation is on the other hand a lethal irreversible phenomenon It may be exhibited in response to various agents such as KOH NaOH salts of lanthanum and cerium2 etc and in some cases the secretions of the eggs of other species or their blood Hitherto I have not adequately defined this phenomenon as distinct from the agglutination phenomena though in my last study I914 I noted the distinction p 541 The phenomenon is essentially lethal but not all destructive agents exhibit it thus acids so far as I have observed destroy the spermatozoa without causing mass coagulation The phenomenon is irreversible and this suffices to distinguish it from true agglutination even if no other criterion were available However it exhibits quite a different aspect from agglutination in the latter the sperm masses tend to take on a spherical form if originally elongated they contract into balls or break up into smaller masses which become spherical thus offering considerable resemblance to a phenomenon of surface tension as Loeb notes The peripheral spermatozoa are in violent movement until the time of reversal In the masscoagulation reaction on the other hand there is no such surface tension effect strands anastomose 1 Loeb argues that the necessity of movement on the part of the spermatozoa for the appearance of this phenomenon removes it from the category of true agglu tination but this seems to me to be a purely arbitrary criterion 2 My attention was called to the action of the salts of these metals by a letter from James Gray of Cambridge University 20SPERM AGGLUTINATION AND FERTILIZATION with other strands and form a network and the movements of the spermatozoa soon cease The substances of egg secretions which I have hitherto called heteroagglutinins belong to this category in some cases at any rate Though I will not assert that there is no such sub stance as a heteroagglutinin in the real sense of agglutination yet the substance in Arbacia blood or egg secretions the effects of which on Nereis sperm I have previously studied should be regarded as a toxic rather than an agglutinating substance having the mass coagulant action As I stated in my last paper p 541 it produces a permanent coagulum in Nereis sperm sus pensions in this respect the action differs from the isoagglu tination which is without toxic effects We must keep firmly in mind the distinctions between aggre gation tropisms agglutination and masscoagulation Agglu tination with which we are particularly concerned is distin guished from aggregation by the facts that it occurs in the absence of a gradient it involves physical adhesion and cannot be repeated if the reaction is once complete it also is characterized by a high degree of specificity1 From mass coagulation it is distinguished by the facts I that it is nontoxic 2 reversible 3 dependent on motility of the spermatozoa Agglutination occurs so far as I have observed with certainty only in response to eggsecretions of the same species For description of the phenomena of agglutination of sperm by eggextractives of the same species I must refer to my previous paper Lillie I9I3a the phenomenon in Arbacia is a true agglu tination in the sense defined not a tropistic reaction nor yet a mass coagulation Loeb has admitted this for Arbacia and I would therefore venture to suggest the probability that the phe nomenon which Loeb has described in Strongylocentrotus and termed cluster formation which he interprets with some reserve as a possible tropistic reaction is also true agglutination which differs only quantitatively from Arbacia and Nereis The Loeb admits that the cluster formation exhibits a high degree of specific ity It is therefore inconsistent to interpret the reaction as he also does as a possible tropistic phenomenon because such phenomena so far as we know do not exhibit specificities of this kind Agglutination phenomena on the other hand as is well known commonly exhibit equal specificity of a similar kind 21FRANK R LILLIE conditions under which it occurs in response to egg secretions of the same species its character reversibility and the specificity of the reaction are identical with Arbacia It is apparently however less pronounced and therefore not so readily recog nizable of itself as an agglutination phenomenon Even the apparent surface tension phenomena which Loeb describes for the clustersShort streaks or cylinders contract into spherical masses the above described clusters and long cylinders break up into a series of small clustersare the same as I previously described for Arbacia I9I3a pp 550551 Loebs interpretation of the clusterformation as a possible tropistic reaction confuses the two sets of phenomenaviz aggregation a true tropistic phenomenon and agglutination which sperm suspensions may exhibit to the eggseawater of its own species But the aggregation tropism can take place only when there is a gradient from the secretion to the sperma tozoa This is realized under the conditions of my experiment of injecting a drop of eggseawater into a fresh sperm suspension beneath a raised cover slip in such a case the two phenomena take place simultaneously viz aggregation in the form of a ring around or in the introduced drop depending on concentra tion and agglutination These two phenomena are produced by two constituents of the eggseawater as I have already maintained For the study of the aggregation phenomena therefore it is desirable to employ an agent which has no agglutinative action This I did in an extensive series of experiments by the method just referred to 1913 p 533 ff To illustratea drop of a 11oo dilution of a saturated solution of CO2 in seawater injected into a sperm suspension of Nereis in seawater mounted beneath a raised coverslip is marked within a few seconds by the formation of a ring of active spermatozoa within the margin of the intro duced drop and separated from the general sperm suspension by a clear zone nearly free of spermatozoa 15 to 2 mm in diameter I interpreted the ring formation as a positive reaction to the attractive substance CO2 and acids generally the spermatozoa follow the gradient from the suspension into the drop containing CO2 a certain distance i e up to a certain concentration and 22SPERM AGGLUTINATION AND FERTILIZATION are there arrested The proof of this interpretation is found in the fact that if increasing concentrations of CO2 are used the ring forms outside the drop and becomes progressively wider i e the migration ceases at a distance from the center which increases with CO2 or acid concentration see I913a pp 536538 Loeb suggests that the ring formation with a clear external zone around it is an indication that the spermatozoa are negatively chemotropic to the strong eggseawater and possibly positively chemotropic to the more diluted eggseawater or to the dense collection of spermatozoa in the ring The latter suggestion is of course untenable as a primary cause for the ringformation is precisely the phenomenon to be explained It is also unnecessary to assume any negative tropism the ring formation is due to a limitation of the positive movement by concentration This is fully discussed in the paper referred to above but Loeb does not allude to the discussion 2 THE SOURCE OF THE AGGLUTINATING SUBSTANCE Professor Loeb has also taken issue with me on the question of the origin of the agglutinating substance He regards his experiments as proving that the substance which causes the cluster formation is not formed in the egg but in the chorion i e in the layer of jelly which surrounds the egg On the other hand I regarded it and still hold to the opinion as a secretion of the egg with which the jelly of course becomes saturated1 Loebs observations again were on Strongylocentrotus and mine on A rbacia The issue is a real one even though the chorion is itself a secretion of the egg in earlier stages Loebs conclusion was based on his observation that if the chorion be dissolved off in dilute hydrochloric acid in seawater the naked eggs transferred to seawater produce no detectable amounts of the agglutinating substance any more whereas the acid seawater contains it in large quantities My conclusions were based on the observation that when eggs of Arbacia are deprived of jelly chorion by shaking or a prolonged series of 1 Glaser 1914 also agrees substantially with me the agglutinating substance is located in greatest abundance in the jelly and the eggs also contain this material P 37I 23FRANK R LILLIE washings they still continue to produce the agglutinating sub stance in seawater though in much diminished quantity in my full paper which Loeb had not the opportunity of consulting I gave series of measurements on this point 1914 pp 532538 I also pointed out that in immature ovaries containing many primary ovocytes but some mature eggs the quantity of agglu tinating substance produced was relatively very small 1914 p 530 and I therefore suggested that the substance was secreted by the eggs at the time of maturation and was soaked up by the jelly as by a sponge The eggs however continue to produce it after maturation as I shall show The immature eggs have as thick a chorion as the mature eggs therefore the agglutinating substance cannot be merely dissolved chorion I recognized the possibility of the view expressed by Loeb investigated it as fully as possible at the time and rejected it Since Loebs paper has appeared I have repeated his experi ments and found my former observations and conclusions con firmed in all respects ExperimentsThe optimum concentration of HCI for removal of jelly without injury to eggs was found to be 50 cc seawater  I14 cc NIo HCl 12 cc Nio HCI in 50 cc seawater did not fully remove the jelly and 16 cc caused too much injury to the eggs evidenced by heavy agglutination and later cytolysis In an experiment of July 17 I914 the three above concentrations were used The complete removal of the chorion in the inter mediate concentration was demonstrated by observation of the eggs in a thick suspension of India ink in seawater even the minutest traces of adherent jelly can readily be detected by this method but it was all gone The eggs were then washed as follows IoII AM 426 cc 1040 515 cc Io58 504 cc The supernatant fluid was then tested and found to be free from sperm agglutinating substance thus furnishing proof that all originally contained in the jelly had been washed out At II20 the supernatant fluid was poured off leaving only 5 cc in the tube The eggs were allowed to settle and at I 125 the super natant fluid was tested and gave a 9Iosecond agglutination reaction with fresh sperm suspension Thus these eggs entirely deprived of jelly by HC1 are producing agglutinating substance 24SPERM AGGLUTINATION AND FERTILIZATION At 425 PM the eggs were washed again 507 cc and the new fluid gave a I4second reaction The next morning the same eggs were washed again 55I cc The new fluid gave a 67 second reaction These results may be expressed in a different way thus in an experiment of July 20 a series of eight successive washings of eggs deprived of jelly by acid seawater represented a dilution of the agglutinating substance contained in the acid seawater remaining with the eggs of I2700800 times But the acid solvent itself was negative at I800 dilution it was of 400 agglutinating power In other words after the removal of the jelly the eggs themselves had produced a sufficient quantity of the agglutin ating substance to account for the tremendous difference and they were still producing it These eggs without jelly are fertilizable as Loeb states but only 37 per cent segmented in a heavy insemination of the first day in the experiment of July 17 and only a small part of these developed to the ciliated stage none of which were normal most being stereoblastulae and incapable of farther development The result is entirely similar to that described in my last paper study VI 14 for the fertilization of eggs deprived of jelly by shaking and subsequent washing The same experiment was repeated on July I8 20 and 21 with identical results the eggs from which jelly is entirely removed by HCI continue to produce the spermagglutinating substance fertilizin so long as they live but their capacity for development after fertilization is much reduced In all experiments at least three concentrations of acid were used and in each experiment it was observed that when the con centration was sufficient to dissolve the jelly there was a good deal of agglutination of the eggs and in the later washings a great many eggs broke down liberating their pigment As I have previously shown brokendown eggs liberate a substance antifertilizin which neutralizes the sperm agglutinating action of the fertilizin Therefore when a sufficient percentage of the eggs are breaking down the production of spermagglutinating substance fertilizin by intact eggs may be entirely masked I have no intention of disputing Professor Loebs observations 25FRANK R LILLIE for Strongylocentrotus But they merely prove either that Strongylocentrotus sperm is not so delicate an indicator as A rbacia sperm or that the method employed by Loeb was inadequate to detect small quantities of fertilizin In Arbacia the eggs con tinue to charge the seawater with spermagglutinating substance after complete removal of the jelly whether by shaking and repeated washings or by HC1 and the substance continues to be formed as long as the eggs remain fertilizable and living no matter how often the eggs are washed The eggs of Arbacia secrete the substance as I previously maintained It is not merely the dissolved chorion It might possibly be objected to this conclusion that the con tinued appearance of the agglutinating substance in egg suspen sions in seawater after removal of the chorion indicated merely previous adsorption of the substance of the chorion But the indefinite continuance of its production is inconsistent with the idea of a mere secondary removal of an adsorbed substance The idea is also inconsistent with the fact that Nereis eggs have no jelly at the time laying but produce a similar sperm agglu tinating substance In this form the jelly also is secreted by the egg after insemination Finally if it can be shown that the jelly of immature eggs is entirely devoid of the sperm agglutinating substance my position that this substance is a later secretion of the egg is rigorously proved As noted above I maintained the probability of this view in my previous paper Study VI This summer my first experiments were undertaken to investigate this point anew Fortunately the season was late and not a single Arbacia was ripe when I began work June 8 This applied to males as well as females so it was impossible at first to secure ripe sperm as indicator I therefore made extracts of immature ovaries to be kept for subsequent testing from three females I 2 and 3 June 8 June I extracts of ovaries in seawater were made from females 4 5 and 6 numbers 4 and 6 contained only ovo cytes No 5 had a large number of ripe ova in addition On June I6 extracts I6 were tested with Arbacia sperm suspension I 2 3 4 and 6 were absolutely negative no agglutination No 5 gave a strong agglutination reaction lasting about one minute 26SPERM AGGLUTINATION AND FERTILIZATION It is highly improbable that the agglutinating substance had been destroyed in five of the six and retained in the only one No 5 of the extracts which was made from ovaries containing some ripe ova So far as these observations go the jelly of immature ovocytes is free of agglutinating substance Again on June 15 I made extracts from ovaries of three females in two of which ripe ova were practically absent the third had a few Tested the same day the two former extracts had no sperm agglutinating properties the third gave slight agglu tination The females appeared to mature slightly earlier than the males so that for these experiments I was forced to use rather thin sperm suspensions mixed more or less with immature spermato zoa which were probably not as delicate indicators as one could wish However the difference between the ovaries containing ripe ova and those without was perfectly distinct Later when fully ripe males could be had all ovaries contained ripe ova The following observation also tends in the same direction June 27 I914Three females were selected of which number I was the ripest attainable the eggs flowing freely out of detached ovaries and very few ovocytes occur numbers 2 and 3 were the least mature attainable number 2 had very few detachable ova mostly late ovocytes with a sprinkling of ripe eggs number 3 had quite a few detachable ova with a large proportion of ripe eggs The ovaries of all three were cut up equally and seawater added to each to make 0o cc When the ova and ovaries had settled they stood at 15 cc in I at 13 cc in 2 and 15 cc in 3 After five hours tests of the agglutinating strength of the super natant fluids were made with clear fresh sperm No I gave a Iosecond reaction at I800 dilution No 2 gave a 6second reaction at IIo dilution No 3 gave a 7second reaction at 140 dilution Thus No I is 80 times the strength of 2 and 20 times the strength of 3 In general the fertilizin production is proportional to the ripeness of the ovaries There is not the slightest doubt in my mind about the demon strative character of these observations The appearance of agglutinating substance in the jelly of Arbacia eggs is secondary 27FRANK R LILLIE and takes place probably at the time of breaking down of the germinal vesicle Loebs contention that the agglutinating substance is merely dissolved chorion therefore does not hold for Arbacia With this his argument against my fertilizin theory also falls More over if it should turn out that the substance which is responsible for the cluster formation is identical with the substance which Lillie calls fertilizin which is very likely the case Lillies theory becomes untenable since this substance does not in all probability originate from the egg but from the chorion and since there is as we have seen no connection between the presence of this substance and the power of the eggs of being fertilized pp I36I37Loeb I4 In this statement Loeb sums up the essentials of his criticism since I have shown that cluster formation is true agglutination which Loeb now admits and that the agglutinating substance my fertilizin is not dissolved chorion but a true secretion of the eggs which continues to be produced after the chorion is removed the entire stated criticism becomes ineffective There is a connection between the presence of this substance and the power of the eggs of being fertilized the substance can first be demonstrated at the time that the power of being fertilized first arises viz after breakdown of the germinal vesicle it can be demonstrated as long as eggs retain the power of being fertilized whether the chorion be removed or not and it disappears ab solutely after fertilization as I showed in my previous paper study VI p 553 I914 3 OTHER CRITICISMS Another objection raised by Loeb is that the supernatant seawater of the eggs of Strongylocentrotus franciscanus will not induce cluster formation of the sperm of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus yet the latter sperm fertilizes the eggs of francis canus from which he argues that the fertilizin of Strongylo centrotus franciscanus can not be necessary for the fertilization of its eggs An error in logic is involved here agglutination of sperm is merely an indicator of the presence of a certain substance which is none the less present in franciscanus even if purpuratus 28SPERM AGGLUTINATION AND FERTILIZATION sperm does not reveal it it may nevertheless be activated by purpuratus sperm and this is the essential point in the theory Agglutination of sperm is of no significance except as indicator As I pointed out in my previous paper binding of the fertilizin by sperm receptors i e the chemical reaction is a thing entirely distinct from agglutination if such binding causes a certain kind of physical surface change of the spermatozoa of suspensions of a certain minimum concentration they agglutinate otherwise not Agglutination is a valuable indicator that enables us to make certain analyses and that is all The same principle of fer tilization may hold in the entire absence of sperm agglutination Another objection in which Loeb supports the possibility of superposing fertilization on parthenogenesis will be dealt with in a separate paper My contention in this case is that the possi bility of such superposition always rests upon incompleteness of the parthenogenetic reaction if the fertilization reaction be complete whether by parthenogenesis or insemination it cannot be repeated Everybody admits that eggs fertilized by sperm cannot be refertilized it is a logical impossibility that eggs fer tilized by parthenogenetic reagents should be refertilized The problem of the apparent contradiction involved in Loebs and Herbsts contention of superposition works out in the manner indicated A study of this problem by one of my students will appear soon Loeb cites as a farther difficulty of my fertilizin theory which he says I have not considered that in addition to the membrane forming substance still another namely a correcting agency is necessary for causation of the development of the egg Though 1 Loeb states I914 p 135 If the phenomenon of cluster formation were in separably associated with the power of the eggs of being fertilized we should expect that sperm should only be able to fertilize the eggs of a species if the eggseawater of the same species caused the cluster formation of the sperm I have never maintained that agglutination cluster formation is inseparably associated with the power of the eggs of being fertilized but merely that a certain substance pro duced by the egg is a necessary factor in fertilization In some cases this substance fertilizin produces agglutination of the sperm of its own species and this reaction furnishes an indicator of its amount when present or of its absence In other cases such an indicator is lacking I do not find that supernatant seawater of the eggs of the starfish Asteria forbesii for instance agglutinates its own sperm but I have evidence to be published elsewhere that the mechanism of fertilization may be explained in the same way as in Arbacia 29FRANK R LILLIE I cannot accept this statement of the problem I have nevertheless taken into consideration the fundamental fact to which Loeb alludes in the full account of my experiments which appeared after Loebs paper was in press The fundamental fact is simply that the fertilization process in some cases can be divided in two sharply marked stages This is perhaps most simply and convincingly shown by my own experiment Lillie I9II of removing the spermatozoon from the egg of Nereis after it had already induced the cortical changes with the result that the developmental phenomena came to a standstill before the first cleavage I cannot agree with Loeb that the second stage in volves a factor corrective of an excess action of the factor of the first stage I think it is probable that we have a progressive process readily capable of resolution into two stages In my complete paper Lillie 1914 I considered the second phase of fertilization with reference to the new theory and may refer the reader to the discussion there given study VI pp 582584 Here it is only necessary to point out that the fertilizin theory is at least as well adapted to account for the two stages as the lysin theory 4 CONCLUSION I may be allowed to emphasize the essential features of my theory with some added light thrown by the work of this summer The fundamental conception is that all agencies initiating development of the egg do so by the same means viz activation of an ovogenous substance which I have termed fertilizin This conception brings fertilization and parthenogenesis under one conception I further assumed that such activation in the case of fertilization was caused by union of a constituent substance of the spermatozoon the sperm receptors with the fertilizin and that the activation expressed itself by consequent union of the fertilizin with certain egg substances the egg receptors The reaction was thus conceived in terms of the Ehrlich side chain theory and was represented diagrammatically accordingly That certain chemical combinations form an essential feature of the fertilization reaction cannot be open to doubt I have not previously taken into account the consideration that the 30SPERM AGGLUTINATION AND FERTILIZATION occurence of such reactions taking place as they must across the egg membrane is dependent on physical conditions of the membrane especially its permeability to the substances con cerned In speaking as I did of five blocks to the fertilization reaction I was concerned only with the chemical reactions in volved There may be other blocks of a physical nature Indeed these were much in evidence in the fertilization of Asterias which I studied in the first part of the summer and shall report on elsewhere Another important consideration is that the reaction must also be dependent on environmental conditions such as temperature ionic constitution of the medium see Loeb I4b etc Blocking of fertilization may also arise from such causes Continuing the exposition of the theory I identified the fertil izin of Arbacia with the substance found in the fluid of egg sus pensions which causes agglutination of sperm suspensions of the same species This phenomenon cannot possibly be lacking in significance for it furnishes direct evidence of a combination of egg and sperm derivatives the phenomenon itself is not con cerned in fertilization for a single spermatozoon may fertilize an egg Neither does the absence of such agglutination in other species affect in the least the conclusion that may be drawn from Arbacia because we may have a combination of egg and sperm derivatives without any sperm agglutination The agglutination is incidental the combination is the essential thing The fertilizin theory in its essential aspects is not dependent on the identification of fertilizin and sperm agglutinating sub stance I believe in their identity but if it were proved as Loeb has sought unsuccessfully to do that the agglutinating substance is not essential for fertilization the fertilizin theory would still not be attacked in its essence The conception that initiation of development is essentially a phenomenon of activa tion would still stand in opposition to theories of external agents acting directly by corrosion cytolysis or coagulation or what not The egg could still be regarded as a selfcontained system with no more than the usual environmental relations It is only from this point of view that the complex phenomena of parthen ogenesis and fertilization can be united in a logical whole 31FRANK R LILLIE The theory of the identity of fertilizin and sperm agglutinating substance rests upon a considerable body of ascertained facts see study VI and it gives us at once a point of attack and a working hypothesis of considerable value I have been able to show for instance that the origin of the capacity of the egg for being fer tilized can be understood on this basis that the cessation of fertilization capacity can also be so understood and that the physiological sterility prevention of polyspermy of fertilized eggs is readily explained by the neutralization of the fertilizin by a substance antifertilizin demonstrably present in the egg On the other hand the theory does not postulate that the fertilizin of all forms should agglutinate sperm of its own species There may be many forms in which the union of the sperm re ceptors with fertilizin does not produce such physical changes of the spermatozoa as to lead to agglutination In those cases in which agglutination does occur we have a reaction very useful in analysis but it cannot be too strongly emphasized that the agglutination itself is to be regarded merely as an indicator of the essential reaction 32SPERM AGGLUTINATION AND FERTILIZATION 33 LITERATURE Glaser Otto 14 A Qualitative Analysis of the EggSecretions

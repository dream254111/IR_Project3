J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1077183,BOOKS RECEIVED,I244618,THE SCHOOL REVIEW BASED UPON THEM THE FORMULAS ARE SUCH AS CAN BE SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED BY THE TEACHER IN A FEW MOMENTS TO ENABLE THE PUPIL TO FEEL THAT IN SOLVING HIS PROBLEM HE IS USING ALGEBRA TO GET THE ANSWER TO A REAL QUESTION THIS BOOK WILL BE FOUND SATISFACTORY AS A GUIDE TO A COURSE OF THE STEREOTYPED SORT BUT IT MAKES LITTLE OR NO CONTRIBUTION TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE TEACHING OF ALGEBRA FIRST COURSE IN ALGEBRA BY WEBSTER WELLS BOSTON D C HEATH  CO 1908 PP 232 IOO THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS BOOK IS ITS SMALL SIZE IT IS INTENDED TO BE A FIRSTYEAR COURSE BUT WHILE IT COVERS ALL THE TOPICS ORDINARILY TREATED IN THE FIRST YEAR THERE ARE SEVERAL WHICH ARE BETTER SUITED TO THE SECOND YEAR IT IS HARDLY A HALFINCH THICK AND MAY BE VERY READILY CARRIED IN THE POCKET THOSE WHO ARE TROUBLED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE BOOKBAGS CARRIED BY OUR HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS WILL WELCOME THIS STEP TOWARD COMPACTNESS THE BOOK IN GENERAL FOL LOWS THE BEATEN TRACK THERE IS AN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF PROBLEMS BASED ON GEO METRIC FIGURES AND SEVERAL GOOD PROBLEMS DRAWN FROM PHYSICS ARE INTRODUCED SEVERAL HANDSOME PLATES IN COLORS ILLUSTRATE GRAPHICAL METHODS BUT FEW TEACHERS I THINK WILL AGREE THAT FIRSTYEAR HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS REQUIRE THE AID OF COLOR SCHEMES TO UNDERSTAND SIMPLE GRAPHICAL PROBLEMS FOR A FIRSTYEAR COURSE OF THE USUAL SORT THIS BOOK IS WELL ADAPTED AND IN COMPARISON WITH A LARGE NUM BER OF SIMILAR BOOKS IT HAS THE MERIT OF COMPACTNESS WILLIAM E STARK ETHICAL CULTURE SCHOOL NEW YORK CITY BOOKS RECEIVED EDUCATION AND

FRS,I206890,2372 SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS SHEWING THE STRANGE EFFECTS OF THE EFFLUVIA OF GLASS PRO DUCEABLE ON THE MOTION AND ATTRITION OF IT BY MR FR HAUKSBEE FRS EXPERIMENT I CONTAINING FARTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE ATTRITION OF GLASS IN THE LATE EXPERIMENTS WHICH SEEM SOMETHING TO ILLU STRATE ATTRACTION OR ELECTRICITY BY THE ENDS OF THE SUR ROUNDING THREADS POINTING TO THE AXIS OF THE AFFRICATED GLASS THERE IS SOMETHING FARTHER VERY REMARKABLE AND WORTHY CONSIDERATION WHICH IS THAT AFTER THE ATTRITION OF THE GLASS HAS BEEN A LITTLE WHILE CONTINUD AND THE EF FLUVIA LAID HOLD ON THE HAIRY OR WOOLLY THREADS FOR I MADE USE OF SUCH AS WE CALL CREWEL THAT THEN NOT WITHSTANDING THE RUBBING WAS CEASD AND THE GLASS MOTI ONLESS YET ALL THE THREADS WOULD CONTINUE THEIR DIRECTED POSTURE FOR FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES AND SOMETIMES LONGER BEFORE THEY COULD DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM THE ATTRACT ING OR ELECTRICAL EFFLUVIA MOREOVER IF ONES FINGER OR ANY THING ELSE IS AS WELL FOR I HAVE TRYD DIVERS THINGS BE APPROACHD NEAR THE POINTING ENDS OF THE THREADS WHILE THE EFFLUVIA ACT WITH SO MUCH VIGOUR AS TO SUSTAIN THEM DIRECTED THAT THEN I SAY THEY WOULD FLEE AND AVOID A TOUCH FROM IT AS IF THE NORTH POLE OF THE MAGNET WAS APPLYD TOWARDS THE SOUTH POINT OF A NEEDLE AND AT THE SAME TIME IF THE FINGER IS HELD NEAR AT ABOUT AN INCH FROM THE END OF THE AFORESAID THREAD IT WILL THERE SEEM TO2373 TO BE ATTRACTED IT REMOVING ITS SELF SOMETHING OUT OF ITS PLACE TO THE APPROACHD BODY BUT IF ANY THING IS HELD BETWEEN THE GLASS AND THE DIRECTED THREAD THEN THE THREAD IMMEDIATELY LOOSES HOLD OF THE EFFLUVIA AND RETIRES TO ITS FIRST POSITION  YET UPON WITHDRAWING THE INTERPOSD BODY IF IT HAS NOT REMOVD IT SELF TOO FAR OUT OF THE REACH OF THE EFFLUVIA IT WILL AGAIN RETURN TO ITS TENDENCY AND SO REMAIN TILL THE WEIGHT OF ITS BODY IS TOO GREAT FOR THE DE CLINING STRENGTH OF THE EFFLUVIA TO SUPPORT IT IN SUCH A DI RECTION I HAVE SINCE TRYD THE SAME EXPERIMENT WITH A GLOBE GLASS WHICH WHEN THE ATTRITION WAS MADE WOULD IN ALL MANNER OF POSITIONS ATTRACT THE SURROUNDING THREADS DIRECTING THEM TOWARDS ITS CENTRE EXPERIMENT II TOUCHING THE DIRECTION OF WOOLLEN THREADS EVERY WAY FROM THE AXIS TOWARDS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF AN AFFRICATED GLASS HAVING PROSECUTED THE EXPERIMENTS OF ATTRITION ON THE OUTSIDE OF GLASS WITH SOME SUCCESS SEVERAL NO TABLE PHAENOMENA HAVING BEEN EXHIBITED BY THEM AND I THINK WHAT THE WORLD IN A GREAT MEASURE HAS NOT BEEN ACQUAINTED WITHAL BEFORE I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT BE AMISS TO CONTINUE THEM A LITTLE FARTHER BY TRYING WHAT APPEARANCES MIGHT BE AFFORDED BY PLACING THE WOOLLEN THREADS AS HERETOFORE USD ON THE OUTSIDE ON THE AXIS WITHIN AND THE ATTRITION TO BE MADE ON THE OUTWARD SUR FACE AS USUAL NOT  IF ANY SUCH EFFLUVIA WERE BY THAT MEANS EMITTED WITHIN THAT THEN THE THREADS WHICH SHOULD BE FIXD ON THE AXIS WOULD EXTEND THEMSELVES AND POINT EVERY WAYS TOWARDS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF IT IN ORDER THEREFORE TO PUT IT TO THE  I TOOK A GLOBE GLASS ABOUT SIX INCHES DIAMETER AND HAVING CONVEYD IN 2374  THE BODY OF IT SOME WOOLLEN THREADS TYD TO A FRICK WHICH WAS PLACD IN IT AS AN AXIS AND BEING FIXD ON THE  THE GREAT WHEEL WAS TURND AND THE HAND AP PLYD AS USUAL BUT SOON I FOUND THE INCONVENIENCE OF A GLASS OF THAT FORM THE THREADS ENTANGLING ONE WITH ANO THER AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO LOOSE OR SEPARATE THEM HOWEVER THEY SEEMD THEN TO ME TO BE DISPOSD HAD THEY BEEN AT LIBERTY TO HAVE ANSWERD MY EXPECTATION BUT THIS IS NOT ALL THAT OCCURRD AT THAT TIME FOR BRINGING MY HAND NEAR THE GLASS WHICH WAS THEN AT REST I WAS SUR PRIZD TO SEE A MOTION OF THE BODIES WITHIN SIDE AND UPON ENQUIRY FOUND IT WAS OCCASIOND BY THE APPROACH OF MY HAND SINCE I COULD BY A MOTION OF MY FINGER TO WARDS THE POINT OF ANY OF THE THREADS THAT TOUCHED NOT THE INSIDE OF THE GLASS BUT NERELY SO WAS BEST DRIVE IT ANY WAY IT SEEMD TO FLY MY FINGER HELD ON ANY SIDE OF IT AND THIS WITHOUT TOUCHING THE OUTWARD SURFACE BY HALF AN INCH OR MORE NOW WHEN THIS EXPERIMENT WAS MADE BY HANGING THE THREADS NEAR THE OUTSIDE IT WAS VERY ODD AS BEFORE RELATED TO SEE THEM FLY THE APPROACH OF A FINGER YET HOW MUCH MORE SURPRIZING IS IT TO SEE THE SAME PERFORMD EVEN WHEN A BODY SO SOLID AS GLASS INTER POSES WHICH SHEWS THE SUBTILTY OF THE EFFLUVIA THE BODY FROM WHICH IT IS PRODUCD SEEMING TO BE NO IMPEDIMENT TO ITS MOTION BESIDES IT SEEMS VERY MUCH TO RESEMBLE OR EMULATE A SOLID SINCE MOTION MAY BE GIVEN TO A BODY BY PUSHING THE EFFLUVIA AT SOME DISTANCE FROM IT BUT WHAT IS STILL MORE STRANGE IS THAT THIS BODY I PRESUME TO CALL IT SO ALTHO SO SUBTIL AS SEEMINGLY TO PERVIATE GLASS WILL NOT AS I HAVE TAKEN NOTICE OF IN A FORMER EX PERIMENT AFFECT A LIGHT BODY THRO A PIECE OF MNSLIN NOW WHETHER THE MUSLIN ABSORPS THE EFFLUVIUM OR WHAT OTHER LAWS IT MAY BE SUBJECT TO I CANNOT TELL BUT SURE I AM TIS VERY AMAZING AND I THINK WITH SUBMISSION WOR THY THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS HONOURABLE SOCIETY I2375 I HAVE TRYD THE SAME WITH A GLASS EXHAUSTED OF ITS AIR BUT IT AFFORDED NOTHING WORTHY TO BE TAKEN NOTICE OF EXPERIMENT III BEING A REPETITION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE FORMER I SINCE PROCURD A GLASS OF A MORE SUTABLE FORM FOR A REPETITION OF THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENT SEE FIG 1 FIG 1 FIG 2 THIS GLASS WAS SCREWD BY THE NECK TO ONE END OF A SPIN DLE AND HAD MOTION GIVEN IT BY THE LARGE WHEEL AS USUAL THIS MANNER OF FIXING AND FIGURE OF THE GLASS GAVE ME THE LIBERTY OF RUBBING IT AS WELL WITHIN AS WITHOUT AL THO ON TRYAL I FIND THAT EITHER WAY IS MUCH THE SAME FOR WHEN THE THREADS ARE HELD WITHIN AND THE ATTRITION MADE ON THE OUTSIDE OR THE CONTRARY OR THE FRICTION MADE ON THE SAME SIDE THE THREADS ARE USD MAKES VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO PROCEED WHEN THE THREADS WERE FIXD ON AN AXIS WITHIN AND THE MOTION AND ATTRITION MADE AS USUAL THE THREADS DID THEN REPRESENT AS I BEFORE EXPECT ED A FORM LIKE FIG 2 AND DURING ITS RESEMBLING THAT FIGURE IF A FINGER WAS APPROACHD NEAR THE OUTSIDE OF THE GLASSA MOTION WOULD BE GIVEN TO THE POINT OF THE THREAD NEAREST IT WITHIN AND AT THE SAME TIME IF THE THREADS THE2376 WERE REMOVD TO THE OUTSIDE AND THE FINGER HELD WITHIN THE LIKE MOTION WOULD BE GIVEN TO THEM THERE GENERAL LY THE THREADS SEEM TO FLY THE APPROACH OF THE FINGER YET SOMETIMES I HAVE SEEN THEM JUMP SUDDENLY TOWARDS IT AT MORE THAN AN INCH DISTANCE TO CONCLUDE THIS EXPERIMENT IT IS WORTH TAKING NO TICE THAT THE FIGURES REPRESENTED BY THE DIRECTED THREADS FROM AND TOWARDS THE CENTRE NOT ONLY MIMICK BUT SEEM MOST LIVELY TO RESEMBLE THE CENTRIPETAL AND CENTRI FUGAL TENDENCIES OF BODIES IN THEIR MOTIONS EITHER WAYS EXPERIMENT IV SHEWING THAT THE EFFLUVIA OF GLASS ARE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE OFFICE OF ATTRITION CAUSING A LIGHT BY FALLING ON AN EXHAUSTED GLASS IN MOTION AS IF RUHBED BY THE HAND THAT THE EFFLUVIA OF GLASS ARE VERY CONSIDERABLE IN THE PRODUCTION OF DIVERS PHAENOMENA HAS ALREADY BEEN ABUNDANTLY PROVD BUT THAT THEY SHOULD ACT THE PART OF A SOLID BODY BY PERFORMING THE OFFICE OF ONE IS STILL MORE ADMIRABLE AND THAT THEY DO SO THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT SUFFICIENTLY DEMONSTRATES AND SEEMS TO CORO BERATE A HINT I GAVE IN THE 2D EXPERIMENT OF THEIR EMULA TING SUCH A BODYBY CAUSING A THREAD TO FLY THE APPROACH ING FINGER I TOOK A LARGE GLOBE GLASS ABOUT 9 INCHES DIAMETER WHICH HAVING EXHAUSTED OF ITS AIR I FIXT TO GIVE MOTION TO IT BY THE MACHINE DESCRIBD IN PHILOS TRANSACT NUMB 304 ITS AXIS STANDING PERPENDICULAR ANOTHER GLOBE GLASS ABOUT THE BIGNESS OF THE FORMER WAS PLACD TO GIVE MOTION TO IT BY A NEW MACHINE AND WAS WROUGHT WITH ITS AXIS PARALLEL TO THE HORIZON THIS LAST MENTIOND GLOBE WITH ITS CONTENT OF COMMON AIR WAS2377 WAS FIXT TO MOVE WITHIN AN INCH OF TOUCHING THE OTHER IN THESE POSTURES THE MACHINES WERE SET ON WORK AND THE NAKED HAND APPLYD TO THE UNEXHAUSTED GIASS THE  OF WHICH IN A LITTLE TIME REACHING THE EXHAUSTED GLASS IN MOTION IMMEDIATELY PRODUCD A LIGHT ON THAT PART OF IT NEAREST TO THE OTHER WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF A TOUCH FROM ANY THING ELSE TO INFLUENCE IT THIS LIGHT IS PRETTY VIGOROUS AND EXTENDS IT SELF SO FAR ON THE GLOBE AS THE EFFLUVIA ARE CAPABLE TO LAY HOLD ONT IT IS NOTHING SO MUCH OF A PURPLE COLOUR AS WHEN IT IS CAUSD BY THE AT TRITION OF THE HANDS BUT WILL CONTINUE OR LIVE ON THE GLOBE FOR HALF A MINUTE OR MORE AFTER THE MOTION OF THE RUBBD GLASS IS CEASD BUT IF THE RUBBD GLASS IS KEPT IN MOTION AND THE OTHER AT REST THE LIGHT INSTANTLY DIES YET RECOVERS AGAIN UPON THE FIRST MOTION GIVEN IT AFTER THIS I TOOK A LONG GLASS WHICH HAD LAIN BY ME EXHAUSTED OF ITS AIR FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS THIS GLASS HAVING BEEN RUBBD A LITTLE WITH MY HAND TO EXPEL THE HUMIDITY ON ITS OUTSIDE I HELD IT OVER THE UNEXHAUSTED GLASS IN MOTION WHICH AT THE SAME TIME WAS RUBBD BY MY HAND INFERREDINFERRED IT WOULD NOW AND THEN FOR IT WAS NOT CONSTANT BE VERY SURPRISING TO SEE WHAT LARGE FLASHES OF LIGHT WOULD BE PRODUCD IN THE LONG GLASS WITHOUT TOUCHING THE GLASS IN MOTION NOR WAS IT SELF EITHER MOVD OR PROVOKD BY ANY IMMEDIATE ATTRITION 14 R V TABULA

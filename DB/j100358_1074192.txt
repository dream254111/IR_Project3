j100358,The School Review,1074192,The Preparatory Education of Medical Students,i244511,THE PREPARATORY EDUCATION OF MEDICAL STUDENTS THE medical profession is at present so grievously over crowded that there is urgent need of some means of diminishing the number of graduates Fortunatelyor unfortunately  the limitation of future practitioners can be very simply effected by requiring a standard of education to which no reasonable person could object as excessive The English language is lacking in words to distinguish sharply between the result of literary and scientific studies which are of use mainly in build ing up the intellect and of those studies that are of value only as they prepare for the practice of some profession and which are of no general interest For both we have the one word education The former is like gold of little practical utility in itself but capable of exchange for almost anything that may be desired The latter may be compared to one of the baser metals of great value to one who has some particular use for it but not adapted to wide circulation So far as professional training is concerned there is no life work which demands so much and yields so little as medicine No other professional study involves so much risk of life and health no other is attended by so great fatigue and few require so great monetary expense and the sacrifice of so much time three to five years While we must admit that the requirements of professional study are all that can reasonably be enforced they are not sufficient to keep the number of graduates within proper bounds and even the medical schools that demand the most of their matriculates still graduate a considerable minority of students who are utterly unfit to practice medicine on the broad basis that ought to char acterize professional labor in any field The conclusion is forced upon us that the time for culling out unsuitable men is not at the end of the medical course but at its beginning The most eminent men of the profession i8PREPARA TORY EDUCATION OF MEDICAL STUDENTS including those who as teachers are urging the adoption of longer and longer courses of study are for the most part gradu ates of twoyear colleges With such illustrious examples it seems plain that the best prepared physician is not necessarily the one who graduates with the most definite knowledge of medical facts but the man who by virtue of a good preliminary education a welltrained intellect and habits of close study will go through life acquiring more and more information and skill When the slightest indication is offered that the increased requirements of medical study are encroaching on the time which the average student can afford for preliminary education it is time to call a halt The encouraging statistics as to the almost unanimous requirement of preliminary education by the medical colleges of this country are misleading In all but a few instances the requirements are so low or so modified by saving clauses that they exclude almost no one In fact the formula tion of requirements which demand so little places an official stamp of approval on comparative ignorance There is at present only one medical college which requires for admission a collegiate education while the great majority accept a red schoolhouse training There will always be shirks who will try to enter the medical professionand every other life work which has genuine or specious attractionswith the least possible exertion Yet the very people who pretend to no knowledge of medicine and who are liable to neglect and injury at the hands of incompetent physicians are not only slow to originate laws for their own protection but view with distrust the practical measures for the regulation of medical practice and education which the better class of physicians are urging upon them For example the present law of the State of New York requiringthe medical student to possess merely a commonschool education was passed only after years of hard work by repre sentative members of the profession It would be interesting to know the true reason for the bitter opposition to a measure destined to throw an additional safeguard around the life and health of the very politicians who voted against it With this example on the part of the richest most populous and one of I9THE SCHOOL REVIEW the most intelligent states of the Union the conclusion is forced upon us that any decided improvement of the existing conditions must be brought about by individual agitation and the voluntary action of medical colleges It is on the whole a favorable indication that the majority of young persons in attendance on schools of all kinds regard an educationprofessional or literarylargely as a means of livelihood Thus while they cannot assume quite the same impartial attitude toward their studies that one might whose only aim was intellectual improvement they have a keener inducement to mental exertion One of the noblest of Ameri can educators the late Martin Anderson antagonized the system of elective studies in college on the ground that a broad gen eral training ought to underlie the gratification of personal inclinations in the pursuit of wisdom He believed that with some few exceptionsthe proper place for elective studies was the postgraduate department Unfortunately for the successful execution of this opinion the vast majority of college students must regard their course not as a preliminary but as a dearly bought consummation of scholastic education At present few students even those actuated by high motives feel that they can so far postpone their entrance on active life as to precede their medical course with one at a literary college Of 250 students at a certain medical school ISabout 7 per cent have collegiate degrees It would hardly seem advisable to compel the other 93 per cent to attain the same standard though all possible encouragement should be given to advanced prelimi nary training and it would certainly be well to require a high school education or its equivalent It is manifestly unfair to require the same length of attend ance on medical lectures from the man who recognizes at a glance the meaning of technical words and whose mind is drilled to the rapid acquisition of knowledge as from some other who must devote half his energies to the mere mastering of words and whose habits of study are almost entirely unformed Yet since the introduction of graded courses of instruction in medi cal colleges it is practically impossible to allow the former to 20PREPARA TORY EDUCATION OF MEDICAL STUDENTS graduate in less time than the latter unless he has pursued cer tain studies such as physics chemistry physiology and micro scopy which are included in the professional curriculum and from which he may be excused The English academic course and the typical collegiate course leading to the degree BL contain almost nothing of direct value to the medical student whereas both the scientific and the classical courses are of direct assistance the latter because it includes the study of the two languages Latin and Greek from which almost the entire medi cal vocabulary of some fifty or a hundred thousand words is derived There are certain scientific studies that can properly be credited on either an educational or a professional course and recognizing this fact several universities allow students to com plete the literary and medical courses of four and three years respectively in six Cornell many years ago offered a pre paratory course in medicine and the writer wishes to urge that colleges and academies throughout the country recognize the needs of prospective medical students not so much by establish ing new branches of instruction as by allowing a proper combi nation to be made from those already offered Such a course would involve the sacrifice of the purely educational ideal but the benefit of inducing hundreds of young men to increase their scholastic training on account of the practical addition to the course would more than compensate for any encroachment on academic traditions So far as a wellequipped college is con cerned especially if professional schools are associated with it all the studies which would have a more or less direct bearing on medicine could be taken as elective branchesit is assumed that in the courses leading to any given degree the student is left free to choose about half his work To include the preparatory medical studies in a highschool curriculum with a proper proportion of purely educational work is rather more difficult The scheme here submitted is a combi nation of the classical and scientific courses Any student of fair ability and in good healthif his health is not robust it is folly for him to contemplate a medical careerought to be able 21TItE SCHOOL REVIEW to complete it in four years while the more mature who are able to pursue four studies at a time during most of the course could finish in three years In the proposed schedule the unit is the term or semester of one hour of recitation daily for about eighteen weeks of five days each Latin Six terms grammar Caesar Cicero half of AEneid GreekFour terms grammar Anabasis part of Iliad Derivation of scientific words MathematicsFour terms Algebra Euclidian geometry PhysicOne term PhysiologyTwo terms including elementary anatomy and hygiene Chemistry Four terms including inorganic and elements of organic chemis try qualitative and rudiments of quantitative analysis BotanyOne term including field work MicroscopyTwo terms including rudiments of histology and bacteriology Stenography Two terms The arrangement of the studies is essentially that ordinarily followed Care must be taken to intersperse the earlier scientific recitations laboratory and excursion work with the more fati guing language and mathematical studies Stenography which is now taught in a number of public high schools is proposed simply as an elective course It is a most valuable aid to the medical student as most of his instruction is in the form of lec tures There is also ample opportunity for the physician to use a rapid system of note taking Sufficient allusion has already been made to the practical utility of Latin and Greek For some reason there is a dread of the latter language After the first few hours work on the alphabet much of the apparent difficulty is dissipated and by omitting the accentswhich are ignored in anglicizing Greek wordsand passing over some of the most irregular inflections a course in Greek could be prepared which would be scarcely more difficult than a corresponding one in Latin Botany and chemistry could be made especially interesting to the medical student by referring to the physiological toxic and therapeutic actions of the various plants and chemicals This however would necessitate such teaching as could not ordinarily be obtained in academies 22PREPARATORY ED UCATION OF MEDICAL STUDENTS The study of the derivation of technical terms from the Greek and Latin would be taken up with the ordinary recita tions in the same way that classical geography mythology and history are now taught In place of the routine grind of com positions on assigned subjects about which the pupil knows little and cares less the writer would suggest that occasional theses be required in connection with the scientific courses It will be noted that some of the courses assigned are more of the nature of diversion or of elective work so that the actual drain on the strength of the student is not as great as the number of term units might indicate Thus much of the botany almost the whole of the microscopy and the greater part of the chemical laboratory instruction would serve as relaxation from the severer requirements of the mathematical and linguistic studies Con sidered as a basis of a four years course the scheme proposed affords ample opportunity for the pursuit of modern languages or such other work as the student may elect A preparatory course of this nature could be made especially attractive if the medical schools would reciprocate by establish ing a preliminary course extending through the summer and early fall so as to add the more technical portions of chemistry physiology and microscopy and allow these branches to be passed off before the beginning of the regular term In the same course could be included enough anatomy so that this study could be concluded at the end of the regular year Thus at the end of his first years attendance on medical lectures the specially prepared student would be a full year in advance of other members of his class Such an arrangement would violate the letter of the present law but it would more than fulfill its spirit so that the necessary modification could be easily secured A L BENEDICT BUFFALO 23

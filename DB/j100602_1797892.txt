the sitnple picture is retained in its integrity and the itn p1ession is more permanent Another erlor not uncommon is to imagille that picturesque clescliptioll refers onlyto those obJects which

ollly when the harnwony of sotlnds finds an echo in the feeings alld when the scenes we contenplate connect themselves in our minds with the happiness or misery of tllose who illhabit them tbat they have any real illterest Hence descsiptions of scenery in a book of travels if they be merely thrown il as is too often the case to fill up or to amuse the fancy are of little valtle whereas whell theit obJect is to excite our sympathy for the 1latul al disadvalltages under which certain nations labour or to point out  It must be rememberel we are speakirag of picturesque descriptions and not

moral illiluealce ill both cases over the rllirlds the dispositions and characters of men then they rise in inlportance and add fresh interest to the travellers narration Every attentive observer will find a great analogy between the general aspect of a country and the temper and sentiments of its inhabitants independent of the immediate influence of climate and whenever this analogy is found not to exist the cause of the anomaly will generally be discovered in a forced and unllatural organization of the social state lndeed there can hardly be a greatel proof of a bad adnsillistration than whell we see a rich and fertile country abounding in all the lavish beauties of lovely scenery illhabited by people of a gloolny and unsocial character Much curious speculation might be made on this matter ansl a great deal might be written o the subject of picturesque descrip tion We have examples in abundance of its abuses and defects and have also a few models of excellence in this part of travel vvriting To enlarge upon the subject here however would be to occupy a space which noust be reserved for subjects of greater interest Before concluding however I will say one word on the subject of the exprexsions made use of in description Whellever we are forciluly struck with any scene moral or ma terial our sentiments are generally exaggerated and if we write while the impressioll is still strong our lanuage naturally partakes of the exaltatioll of our feelings Hence is to be traced mally of those highlycolollred descriptions mhich as they are seldom cor rect are so much the nore dangerous as they delight us more True to the expression of his feeliIsgs the writer had no intentio to deceive his descriptiotls are nevertheless exaggerated and ullen discovered to be so he loses all the itlfluence of autholity To vwrite so as to nlake others feel we must feel ourselves but eloguence to be persuasive need not be florid and description to be striking need not be exatgerated Sinlplicity is often a beauty alld faise colourillg destrows the effect of the ulostbeautiful objects There are certain things vvhich neithel words nor the ablest efforts of the pellcil

Travellers should deal in facts and ill tlleir laudable endeavouss to interest and amuse while they illstruct they should 1lever forget the dignity of their llliSSiON 01 condescend to sacrifice trllth and elegallce to the absurd exitellcies of a corrupted taste Never perhaps were books of travels so much read as now This has induced every tourist to give to the world the account of his rambles under all kinds of titles The corruption ot tllat kind of writing has followed as a natural consequence If tllelefore we would wish accounts of travels and voyages those elements of geo graphical science to maintain their proper station in the estima tion of enlightened Europe we callnot too strongly recommend attention to that most attractive part of such accounts Picturwsque Descrxptzon IIIOn the Eruption of the Folcano of Cosiguina in Nica ragua 17th January 183o By Colonel Don Juan Galindo corresponding Member R G S L ONE of the most stupendous convulsions of the globe ever knowll in America took place last Jalluary in the eluptioll of the volcano of Cosiguina situated in Nicaragua olle of the states of Central America alld near the eastern prolllontory of the bay of Conchagua which separates the waters of the Gulf from the Pa cific It has never been known to break out before The followillg is aal extract from a letter writtel by nlyself and dated Febl uary 7  Still in ignorance respecting the precise theatre of the volcanic eruptions of last month I can as yet only state ms former mis taken conjectures respecting it and others of the same class to hich it gave rise throughout Central America  Near SalamS the chief city of Verapas being on the road from Guatemala to the port of Isalal I distinctly heard on the night betweexl the 16th and 17th of JaIluary continued noises similar to those produced by volcanic eruptions yet with something particular in the sounds which made them rather resemble the discharge of single large guns i On the night of the 22nd I ras also bivouacking OI1 the banks of thePolochic about thirteen leaguos from Isabal Here the apparent firing aain began about 11 PX the guns as e supposed them be ing heard at regular intervals Both my men and myself had been accustomed duriilg our whole lives to hear volcanic eruptiorls in all parts of Central America yet for some hours we entertained not the least doubt that the noise was produced byslrtillery and that it plo ceeded from the direction of lsabal I coukl not therefore but eon cude that an action was taking place in that polt though again re  In latitude 13 N 10ng 87 35 W 2 c 2 On Picturesque Deseription in Books of lXreels 387388 On the Eruption of the Volcano of Coszguina flecting on the improbability of such an event a conjecture occurred to me that the commandant in some extraordinary state of inebriation was celebrating his installation his birthday or some othel event I thus continued in the utmost uncertainty being indeed more and more puzzled by the long continuance of the fiing Towards morning it is true the noise became confused and consequently more resembled ordinary volcanic eruptions yet I resurned my soat journey down the river with considerable doubts on my mind arld the first canoe I met coming up the river I questioned particulatly as to the state of Isabal Nay though the appearance of the men in hel was that of fishermen I had a strong suspicion for some time that they were soldiers in disguise and that their arms were concealed in the bottom of the boat other travellers however subsequently dis pelled mvt doubts  I observed nothing remarkable in the atmosphere or appearance of the night of the 2ind and no ashes fell near me as I have since heard fell in other places Neither were ashes seen in Isabal and the inhabitants there sulposed that a volcanic eruption had taken place in some mountain to their south In Omoa they had the same idea In TIUXi110 showers of ashes fell and there it was also supposed that the sound proceeded from some mountain due south of them In San Salvador the federal city the eruption xvas supposed to hawTe been of the volcano of San Vicente a days journey to the east the heart of the indigo eountry was said to be destroyed by it and forty thousand inhahitants to have perished  But subsequent accounts have shown the falsity of all these conjectures Of the same date with the above is the official repol t from Leon the capital of Nicaracua as follovvs  On the 20th of January in the morning the inhabitants of the townof Masayaheardt toxvard the nexrtheast some faint volcanic sounds whilst those of the town of E1 ATiejo also saw high up in the air a sheet of fire rising perpendicularly lYhich presently declined towards the north This was the same appearance which was observed in the department of Segovia whexe at the same time some reports were heard anl some slight sllocks were expelienced  In this city Leon and in the department of Granada the cata strophe was not perceptibly felt until the dawn of the 25th rhen the eruption developed itself to sllch a degree that the sky sras darkened and continued to deepen till eleven in the mornin when the district vas enveloped in the most fearful darkness terl ific reports being at the same time heard and showers of calcined lava being precipitated over the vhole face of the country  This seene whieh though natural lvas at the same tirne so dsead i1 produeed in the sninds of all the most terrible impression It was attributed to the Disine anger anl the people ran in eroxvds to the temples to implore the merey of Heavex The garrison of the town at the same tirne kept up ineessant discharges of eannon and musketry xYhich xvas done by order of the government by the adviee of some intelligent cllemists lvho thought that by sueh means by letOn the Eruption of he Volcano of Cosigutna 389 ting off rockets lighting fires and causing all the church bells to be rung the atmosphere might be cleared  Equally astonishing was tlle quickness xvith whiehs on the 23rd all the atmosphere ras obscured throughout the department of Nicaragua towards the scutheast The darliness thence moved gradually towards Nandaime where about three oclock in the afternoon the obscurity extellded to the tOlVIl of Risras The same thing occurred in the department of Granada the towns in which suffered nearly to the same extent as that of Leon at Matagalpa in Segovia the darkness lasted thirty six hours  Fortunately not a single life was lost and though some cattle vere destroyed in the immeliate neighbourhool of the motlntain where the eruption occurred it does not appear that the damage was any where so great as was imagined at the period of the catastrophe The sand and ashes vrhich were scattered over tile plains Iather con tributed to fertilize them a fact tlsat ras well ascertained in some places on which rain fell a few days afterwards zerhere the plants showed a most luxuriant appearance ths pasture rose rapidly and everything seemed to promise a forward spring The following is also the translation of a Report dated January 29th from the commandant of Union a seaport situated Oll the western shore of the bay of Conchagua and the nearest place of any consequence to the volcano  On the 20th instant day having dawned with usual serenity at eight oclock towards the southeast a dense cloud ras peceived of a pyramidal figure and accompanied by a rumbling noise This con tinued rising until it covered the sun at which elesation alJout ten oclock it separated to the north and south accompanied by thunder and lightning Finalls it covered the whole firmament about eleven and enlreloped every thing in complete darkness so that the nearest objects were invisible The melarlcholy holing of beast3 the flocks of birds of all species that came to seek as it lvere asylum amongst men tlle terror which assailed the latter the cries of the women and children and the uncertainty caused by so rare a phenomenon all combined to overcome the stoutest heart and fill it lvith apprehen sion At four PM the earth also began to quake and continued in a perpetual undulation which gradually increased rhis ssras followed by a shower of phosphoric sand which lasted til eight P on the same day when a heavy aIld ISne powder like flour began also to fall Thunder and lightnirlg continued the whole night and the folloxving day the 21st at eight minutes past thIne Pr there xvas so long and 57iolent an earthquake that many men who ere walking irl a penitential procession lvere thrown dosrn The daIkness lasted fortythree hours making it indispensable for eGrery one to carry a litht and evexl with their aidit was impossible to see clearly  On the 22nd it was somewhat less darks although the sun was not vrsible but tonvards the morning of the 23rd tremendously loud thun derclaps lvere heard in succession like the firing of pieces of artillery390 On the Eruption of the Malcano of Cosigfiina Of the largest calibre and this fresh occurrence was accompanied by increased showers of dust  From daydawn of the 23rd until ten am a dim light orlly served to show the most meancholy spectacles The streets which from the rocky nature of the soil are full of inequalities and stones appeared qllite level being covered with dust Men women and chil dren were so disfigured that it was impossible to recognise any except blr the souIld of their voices or other circumstances Houses and trees not to he distinguished through the dust which coveled them had the snost horrible appearance yet in spite of these appalling sights they were preferable to the darkness in hich we were again plunged after the said hour of ten and which was as complete as dllriI1g tlle lreceding days The general distress which had been previously somewhat assuaged was thus renewed and although leaving the place wras attended with imminent risk from the wild beasts szr11ich sallied from the forests andssought the tovvns and high roads as happenel in ths rleighbouling srillage of Conchagua and this toxvn into which tigers thrust themsellres yet another terror was suIJelior and more than half the inhabitants of Union mrent forth on fovt abandoning their homes well persuaded that they should never return to them since they prognosticated the total destruction of the town and fled lvith dismay for refuge to the mountains  At halfpast three on the rnorning of the 24th the moon and a fesv stars vere visible as if through a curtain and the subsequent clay was clear although the sun cou1d not be seen since the dust continued falling having covered the ground 3Il round about to the thickr1ess of five inches  The 25th and 26th were marked like the 24th with frequent though not violent earthquakes The cause of all this has been since ascertained to be an eruption of the volcano of Cosiguina which burst out on the 20th I am also informel that on the islalld of Tigre in that direction the shoszers of the 21st were of pumice stones of the size of a pea and some even as large as a hens egg The earth quaked there also more than here but no houses or othel buildings sere thrown down  Many of our people are afflicted with catarrhs headaches sore throats and pectoral affections resulting doubtless from the dust Several persons are thus seriously unwell and yesterday a girl of sesren years old died with symptoms of an inflammatory sore throat The cattle in the neighbourhood are also suffering and flocks of birds are found deal lying in the roads and floatinU on the sea  The showers of dust lasted till the 27th The following is a subsequent report from the same officer dated February s26th  OI1 the sth of the current month a commission went from this po t to oserxre the volcano but could not recognise the coast with perfect distintness OI throughout its entire extent in consequence of the c10uels of smoke which still covered the plains A forest which appeared to be as old as the creation was however bund to have dis

IN LATIN TO THOMAS GALE S T D SECRET REG SOC FROM CARNIO LA BY MR JOHN WEICHARD VALVASOR LIBER BARO CONTAINING THE METHOD OF CASTING STATUES IN METAL TOGETHER WITH AN INVENTION OF HIS FOR MAKING SUCH CAST STATUES OF AN EXTRAORDINARY THINNESS BEYOND A NY THING HITHERTO KNOWN OR PRACTISED I SEND YOU LIKEWISE MY METHOD OF CASTING STATUES IN METAL IN OBEDIENCE TO THE COMMANDS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY IT IS AS FOLLOWS FIRST I FORM OUT OF GOOD CLAY THAT WILL ENDURE THE FIRE AND NOT CRACK EITHER IN DRYING OR BURNING SUCH A FIGURE OR STATUE AS I DESIRE TO CAST WHEN THIS IS WELL DRY I MAKE ALL OVER THE FIGURE LITTLE HOLES OF NO GREAT DEPTH BUT BOTH SIZE AND DEPTH PROPOR TIONATE TO THE BIGNESS OF THE STATUE INTO WHICH I LET SMALL PIECES OF METAL AND WITH SOME OF THE SAME CLAY FIX THEM FIRMLY IN THE HOLES THE USE OF THESE BITTS OF ME TAL MARKED IN FIGURE I AAAAA IS TO KEEP THE CORE AND MOULD FROM TOUCHING ONE THE OTHER OR FALLING TOGE THER WHEN THE WAX RUNS OUT AND THAT THEY MAY REMAIN CONSTANTLY IN THE SAME FIXT POSTURE THIS DONE I SCRAPE AWAY WITH SOME PROPER INSTRUMENT AS MUCH OF THE CLAY IN THICKNESS AS I DESIGN FOR THE THICKNESS OF MY STATUE AND THEN LAYING IT IN A FURNACE I BURN THE CORE TILL IT BE RED HOT BY THE CORE I MEAN ALWAYS THE STATUE FIRST MADE IN CLAY WHEN IT IS COLD I RUB THE CORE ALL OVER WITH THAT FORT OF EARTH OR COLOUR WHICH OUR GERMAN POTTERS USE TO COLOUR THE JOYNTS OF THE TILES WHEN THEY FETT STOVES OF TILES OR KACHELOFENS THIS COLOUR RESEMBLES MUCH THAT WHICH THE FRENCH CALL PLOMB DE MER BLACK LEAD KK WHICH260 WHICH IS USED TO DESIGN ON PAPER AND EASILY WIPES OUT WITH BREAD BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME THIS COLOUR I MIX WITH WA TER AND DAUB ALL OVER THE CORE BECAUSE THE METAL IS FOUND TO RUN FREELY UPON IT THERE ARE OTHER SUBSTANCES PRO PER FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT I HAVE ALWAYS MADE USE OF THIS ESPECIALLY FOR THIN STATUES THIS DONE I LAY ON UPON THE CORE AS MUCH YELLOW WAX MIXED WITH PITCH OR ROSIN AS WILL MAKE THE THICKNESS OF THE INTENDED STATUE WHICH I FORM IN THE WAX WITH ALL THE EXACTNESS POSSIBLE HERE NOTE THAT THE PARTICLES OF METAL MENTIONED TO BE SET INTO THE CORE TO KEEP IT AT A DISTANCE FROM THE MOLD MUST BE SO SET AS TO FALL IN WITH THE SURFACE OF THE WAX EX ACTLY AND THAT THE REASON OF MIXING PITCH OR ROSIN WITH THE WAX IS BECAUSE THAT WHEN IT IS BURNT OUT IT MAKES A GREAT SMOAK AND THAT SMOAK ADHERING TO THE MOLD OCCA SIONS THE METAL TO RUN MORE FREELY AS I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT NEXT I PUT ALL OVER UPON THE SURFACE OF THIS STATUE OF WAX LITTLE PIECES OF WAX WHICH I CALL THE LITTLE CHANELS IN THE FIGURE MARKED CCCCCC ALL WHICH MUST BE CONTRI VED SO AS TO ENTER INTO THE GREAT CHANELS DDD THIS DONE I COVER THE CORE AND WAX ALL OVER WITH THE SAME SORT OF CLAY THAT WILL ENDURE THE FIRE WITHOUT CRACKING AND SO I HAVE MY CONCAVE STATUE OR MOULD MADE UPON THIS I LAY THE GREAT CHANELS MARKED DDDD BOTH UPRIGHT AND TRANSVERSE FORMED LIKEWISE IN WAX AND PLACED AC CORDING TO JUDGMENT SO AS BEST TO RECEIVE THE ENDS OF THE LITTLE CHANELS CCCCC FOR THE MORE EASIE DISTRIBUTION OF THE METAL THESE GREAT CHANELS MUST ALL MEET AT THE TOP OF THE STATUE SO AS TO COME OUT BY ONE HOLE AS AT E WHERE THE METAL IS TO BE POURED IN IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO HAVE A CHANEL OR TWO TO LET OUT THE AIR AS THE METAL EN TERS AS THOSE MARKED FF AND THERE MUST BE A HOLE OR TWO LEFT AT THE FOOT AS GG WHERE THE GREAT CHANELS AND WAX EN STATUE JOYN AND WHEREAT WHEN THE MOULD IS BURNT THE WAX AS WELL OF THE STATUE AS OF THE CHANELS MAY RUN OUT THE GREAT CHAUELS BEING THUS PLACED THE MOULD MUST261 MUST BE AGAIN LAID OVER WITH THE SAME SORT OF CLAY I USE CONSTANTLY TO BIND ABOUT THE MOULD WITH IRON WIRE AND THEN LAY ON MORE CLAY AND WHEN THIS MOULD IS WELL DRIE THEN I HEAT IT RED HOT AS I DID BEFORE THE CORE SO NOW BOTH TOGETHER THE FIRST TIME I PRACTICED THIS METHOD I BURNT BOTH CORE AND MOULD TOGETHER AND ALL THE SMALL BITTS OF METAL MELTED SO THAT THOUGH IT CHANCED TO SUCCEED WELL YET I WAS IN GREAT DANGER OF MISCARRIAGE AND EVER SINCE I BURN THE CORE FIRST THAT SO THERE MAY NOT NEED SO STRONG A FIRE TO BURN THE MOULD BUT FOR SMALL MANAGEABLE STATUES OF NOT ABOVE A FOOT OR TWO HIGH THEY MAY BE BOTH BURNT TOGETHER AND THERE IS NO NEED OF THE HOLES GG BUT THE MOULD MAY BE INVERTED AND THE WAX RUN OUT BY THE CHAN ELS FF AND E THE MOULD BEING THUS BURNT I STOP WITH THE SAME CLAY THE TWO HOLES GG AND THEN I BURY IT IN A PIT AND PRO CEED AS IS USUAL IN CASTING OF BELLS AND THE LIKE BUT CARE MUST BE TAKEN THAT THE METAL BE VERY WELL IN FUSION IF IT BE A SMALL STATUE NOT ABOVE A FOOT OR TWO HIGH WHOSE MOULD MAY BE MANAGED IN ONES HANDS THEN I MAKE ME A CONCAVE STATUE OF WAX OF THE THICKNESS I DESIRE AND THEN PLACE UPON IT ALL THOSE GREAT AND LESSER CHANELS AS AFORE WHICH DONE I PUT IT ALL TOGATHER INTO A LIQUID SUBSTANCE MADE OF PLAISTER AND TILE OR BRICK DUST TEMPRED WITH WA TER BUT I DOUBT NOT BUT THE WAY OF CASTING IN PLAISTER IS WELL KNOWN IN LONDON AND THEREFORE SHALL NOT NEED TO WRITE IT IF THE STATUE BE INTENDED VERY THIN THEN I TAKE COPPER AND WHEN IT IS WELL IN FUSION I MIX WITH IT A GOOD QUANTI TY OF ZINC WITHOUT OBSERVING ANY CERTAIN PROPORTION OF WEIGHT THE MORE ZINC THE BETTER THE METAL RUNS I HAVE SOMETIMES FOR SMALL AND THIN STATUES PUT IN ABOVE A THIRD PART OF ZINC NOW ZINC IS A CERTAIN MINERAL SUB STANCE LIKE MARCASITE OR BISMUTH IN FRENCH DU ZINC WITH OUT IT OUR WORK WOULD NOT SUCCEED IF IT BE VERY THIN AND K K 2 I262 I HAVE FOUND BY EXPERIENCE THAT THIS MINERAL MAKES THE METAL RUN MOST FREELY AND GIVES IT A FAIR GOLDEN COU LOUR THE STATUE BEING CAST I TAKE OFF THE MOULD AND CUT OFF ALL THE LITTLE CHANELS ALL WHICH BOTH GREAT AND SMALL ARE FILLED WITH METAL WHICH MAY BE KEPT FOR FURTHER USE IN THESE THERE IS MUCH MORE METAL THAN IN THE WHOLE STA TUE FOR IF THE STATUE BE VERY THIN THERE MUST BE MORE AND BIGGER CHANNELS AND SO THE CHEAPER THE THE STATUE THE MORE WEIGHTY THE CHANELS AND THE MORE METAL RE MAINING TO KNOW THE QUANTITY OF METAL REQUISITE FOR MY IN TENDED WORK I TAKE A LUMP OF THE SAME MIXTURE OF WAX AND PITCH WITH WHICH I MAKE THE MOULD OF MY STATUE AND HAVING WEIGHED IT I MAKE A MOULD UPON IT AND CAST IN THE SAME A LUMP OF METLE OF THE SAME SIZE WHICH I WEIGH AND THEREBY COMPUTE THE PROPORTION OF THE WEIGHT OF THE METTLE AND WAX THEN OBSERVING HOW MANY POUNDS OF WAX I USE ABOUT THE FIGURE AND CHANELS I CAN CALCULATE TO A SMALL MATTER HOW MUCH METAL I NEED TO MELT THIS IS MY MANNER OF CASTING STATUES VERY THIN AND WHICH ALWAIS SUCCEEDED HAPPILY WITH ME HITHERTO I HAVE CAST NO STATUE ABOVE NINE FOOT HIGH BUT I DOUBT NOT BUT I COULD BY THE SAME METHODS CAST ONE OF ANY BIG NESS DESIRED AND WHEN WE SHALL BE MORE AT EASE FROM OUR ILL NEIGHBOUR THE TURK I WILL CAST AT ONE FUSION THE STA TUE OF OUR EMPEROUR LEOPOLD I SETTING ON HORSBACK MUCH GREATER THAN THE LIFE I HAVE BEEN ALREADY IN TREATY ABOUT THE CHARGES THEREOF WITH THE STATES OF THIS COUNTRY AND IF THESE TURKISH TROUBLES HAD NOT COME UPON US IT HAD BEEN NOW FINISHED C THE

j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1009209,Notes on Municipal Government,i242521,NOTES ON MUNICIPAI GOVERNMENT AMERICAN CITIES Greater New YorkFinancial Condition In his message to the municipal assembly on January 3 Mayor Van Wyck charged the administration of the old city of New York with extravagance and declared his belief that this had resulted in the citys having exceeded its constitutional debt limit which is fixed at Io per cent of the assessed real property valuation Section io of Article VIII of the state constitution declares that  This section shall not be construed to prevent the issuing of certificates of indebtedness or revenue bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes for amounts actually contained or to be contained in the taxes for the year when such certificates or revenue bonds are issued and payable out of such taxes The same section contains provisions which have been inter preted to mean that the indebtedness of a county which is included in whole or in part in the territory of a city as in the case of the Greater New York shall not be reckoned as part of such citys indebtedness Notwithstanding these provisions the corporation counsel John Whalen rendered an opinion that certain of these obligations should be included and acting upon this opinion the comptroller Bird S Coler issued a statement that the old city of New York has exceeded its legal indebtedness by over 24000000 and the new city by 25000000 more The authorities thereupon ordered work upon a large number of contracts stopped and declined to allow work to begin on many more This statement of Comptroller Coler was criticised by former Comp troller Ashbel P Fitch and others who declared that the constitution had been misinterpreted for political purposes particularly to prohibit the issuing of bonds for an underground system of rapid transit Suits to determine the issue were threatened by interested property owners and contractors and in the early part of April the corporation counsel and comptroller revised their figures by deducting nearly 20oooooo from the street and park opening bonds This was followed by other deductions from time to time and finally on May 24 the corporation counsel rendered a final opinion that the old city had not reached its debt limit by over rooooooo and the new city by a much larger sum On June 7 following the opinion of the corpora  Communication of George W Miller Esq Assistant Secretary of the City Club 144NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT tion counsel the comptroller made a statement before the board of estimate and apportionment showing that the city was well within its debt limit and the board reauthorized the issue of 2I000000 of bonds for public works authorized by the administration of the old city and an additional issue of several million dollars for improve ments Police Several months ago rumors became current that Tammany Hall desired that Chief of Police McCullagh a Republican be retired by the bipartisan police commission to make room for a Tammany Democrat in the interest of a more liberal interpretation of certain laws to fulfill Tammanys anteelection pledges or in order in popu lar phrase to  run the town wide open To accomplish the retire ment of Chief McCullagh required the unanimous vote of four police commissioners or that three vote for retirement to become operative upon confirmation by the mayor The two Republican police commissioners Messrs Hamilton and Phillips declined to retire MIcCullagh and upon May 21 the mayor acting under a provision of the charter allowing him to remove heads of departments without cause during the first six months of his term removed Commissioners Hamilton and Phillips and upon the same day appointed Jacob Hess in place of one of the Republicans removed The board then consisting of two Democrats and one Republican voted to retire Chief McCullagh which action was immediately ratified by the mayor In the meantime the old police board had by successive steps advanced Police Captain William F Devery a Tammany Democrat from inspector to deputy chief and the new board promoted him to be chief of police of the Greater New York in place of Mr McCullagh In I893 Captain Devery was twice called upon by Dr Parkhursts society to suppress disorderly houses in his precinct Captain Devery denied the existence of such houses The society then proceeded individually against the keepers of the houses complained of and secured the conviction of many of them The grand jury then found four indictments against Captain Devery for neglect of duty but upon trial the jury failed to convict This case largely caused the appoint ment of the Lexow Police Investigating Committee before which damaging testimony was given against Devery The police commis sioners then in power thereupon tried Devery and by a vote of three to one he was convicted and dismissed from the force Later the appellate division of the Supreme Court ordered his reinstatement upon the ground that his constitutional rights had been neglected in his trial before the commissioners In I896 the new police board of which Theodore Roosevelt was president was unable owing to legal techni calities to reopen the case against Devery He was assigned to an I45146 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY unimportant uptown district and remained there until the Tammany administration of I898 when he was rapidly promoted to be chief After the removal of Messrs Hamilton and Phillips the Republican machine organization undertook to start a movement to have Mayor Van Wyck removed upon charges by the governor for his part in the retirement of Chief McCullagh but the effort met with no success as it is believed that the mayor was within his legal powers in the matter A special session of the legislature is suggested by the Republicans to amend the bipartisan police law and to take all control of elections away from the police board as a partial remedy Primary Elections Primary elections under the new primary law Chapter I79 laws of 1898 were held throughout the Greater New York on June 7 This law was said to be designed to allow greater freedom in primary voting among independent Republicans who professed to believe in the national and state policy of the Republican party and incorporated many of the safeguards of the socalled ballot reform law in the primary law Few contests were made by the inde pendent Republicans in the district organizations and the result in the Republican party was a victory for the machine men in thirty out of thirtyfivedistricts in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx In Brooklyn the Worth faction and the regular Republican machine practically joined forces In both the Platt and Tammany machines the old chairmen or  leaders of districts were nearly all reelected Public Education Budget The board of estimate and apportion ment on May 9 formally passed upon the amounts to be allowed to the Greater New York for educational purposes The amounts for the various boroughs are Manhattan and the Bronx 695991023 Brooklyn 3614628oo Queens 69o42498 Richmond 3668472I a total of 1159181042 or about i86oooo more than the sums allowed for the same territory in 1897 These amounts do not include the expenses of the general board of education the College of the City of New York the Normal School or the Nautical School The approximate per capita cost of education in the different boroughs for 1898 will be Manhattan and Bronx 3393 Brooklyn 2948 Queens 2649 Richmond 3257 Rapid Transit The rapid transit question at present seems to have developed into a squabble between the rapid transit commissioners and the elevated railway companies as to the terms under which the elevated railways shall be allowed to construct parallel railways and connecting links under seven additional franchises offered to the elevated railways by the rapid transit commission The political troubles between the commlissioners and the city administration continues The mayor has declined to serve upon a subcommittee ofNOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT the rapid transit commission appointed to decide upon compensation to be paid by the elevated railways for these additional franchises Brooklyn Bribery Cases In the latter part of March indictments were found by the Kings County Brooklyn grand jury for conspiracy to defraud bribery passing false accounts and falsely certifying to work done against the following officials of the old city of Brooklyn under the administration of Mayor Wurster which came to an end in December I897 Theodore B Willis city works commissioner Robert W Fielding deputy commissioner Joseph R Clark president of the board of aldermen William Leacraft alderman William Milne inspector in the city works department Oscar Knapp water purveyor William H Goff superintendent of sewers A L Jensen warrant clerk and William E Phillips a prominent politician related to Commissioner Willis and until recently one of the four bipartisan police commissioners of the Greater New York All of these officials were machine Republicans These indictments grew out of an investi gation by Comptroller Coler which showed that the law requiring that all contracts for public work for amounts of two thousand dollars or more should be publicly let had been violated by the indicted officials by the old political trick of dividing large amounts of work into small contracts and granting these contracts privately to favored politicians A sample case was that of a sum of 729o614 expended for grading streets and covering water mains during October Novem ber and December 1897 the contracts for which were granted to three or four contractors in amounts between I9oo and 2ooo Trials of the indicted officials are now in progress and Deputy Commissioner Fielding has already been convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment and to pay a large fine Mayors Message The first message of the new mayor of Greater New York to the municipal assembly gives evidence of the unsettled condition of the government of the city under the new charter The mayor seems to be at sea as to the actual state of the citys indebted ness According to his estimate based upon the comptrollers reports the total assessed valuation of real estate in Greater New York is 2464763192 and the net funded indebtedness 22745352911 This leaves an apparent margin within the constitutional limit of a further indebtedness of about 19oooooo In speaking of the organization of the new municipal departments the mayor comments upon the friction inevitable to reorganization of city government He feels confident however that all such short comings will be remedied as soon as the newly appointed officials become more closely conversant with their duties In commenting on the plan for improved transit facilities the mayor strongly favors 147I48 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the extension of the elevated railway system Under the recent decision of the New York Supreme Court it will be impossible to construct a rapid transit system without exceeding the constitutional limit of indebtedness The mayor regrets that the patience protests and the demands of the people for better transit facilities have been answered with nothing better than a multiplicity of plans Through out the message there is manifest a spirit of antagonisim to the com missions that exercised authority under the administration of his predecessor PhiladelphiaMayors Message The most important portion of the Third Annual Message of the mayor for the year ending December 31 1897 relates to the water supply of the city The imperative necessity of an improvement in the water supply is attested by the appalling disease and deathrate directly traceable to the present source of supply The mayor strongly recommends the appropriation of a sufficient amount to establish a thorough system of filtration He intimates that this improvement should be made by the municipality especially as the cost will not be beyond the financial resources of the city It is expected that 37oo0oo will cover all necessary improve ments This is a comparatively insignificant expenditure when it is remembered that the water works yield a large surplus each year Thus in I897 the total receipts of the water bureau were 297135752 and the expenditures during the year for permanent improvements and the cost of maintenance were I665I532i Thus the excess of receipts over expenditures in the annual revenue of this branch of the city service was 13062043I If a system of filtration is established it is probable that some measures will be necessary to prevent the inordinate waste of water which is going on at the present time During the last ten years the consumption per capita per day has increased from eightynine to one hundred and eightyseven gallons There is no doubt that a plentiful supply of water is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the city but it is equally true that the consumption of one hundred and eightyseven gallons per capita per day is beyond all reasonable limits One change which will probable remedy the most flagrant abuses will be to place water meters in all manufacturing establishments and it is probable that in time the water meter system will be introduced throughout the city to check this useless waste MassachusettsReport of the Board of Gas and Electric Light Commissioners The Thirteenth Annual Report of the Massachusetts Board of Gas and Electric Light Commissioners for the year I897 gives an interesting account of the condition of that industry throughout the state This board has now under its supervision one hundred andNOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT thirtyfour companies and the gas or electric plants of thirteen towns and two cities The commission exercises a very careful and close control over the financial operations of all companies No change of organi zation of capital stock of indebtedness can be made without first obtaining the consent of the commission Furthermore the commis sion has power to remedy any shortcomings in the service of such companies Its work has been particularly valuable in preventing the watering of stock and overcapitalization which has been such a serious handicap in the exercise of public control over private corporations One of the most suggestive portions of the report is the description of the movement toward municipal ownership which seems to have taken a strong hold of the towns and cities of the state The follow ing table shows the extent to which municipal ownership and opera tion has proceeded up to December 31 I897 Popu Year

question of municipal gas and electric lighting and it is to be expected that within the next five or ten years a large number of municipalities will join the list of those who are now supplying gas and electric light for both public and private purposes BostonDepartment of Municipal Statistics The Board of Munici pal Statistics organized by the city of Boston under ordinance of February 27 I897 has directed its first efforts toward a more scientific classification of municipal revenue and expenditure In fact in its First Annual Reportwhich has just been published the board addresses itself to the larger problem of reorganizing the system of municipal 149150 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY accounting The lack of uniformity in the system of financial classification in the various city departments together with the failure to coordinate related departments in their method of financiering has made it quite impossible to determine accurately the financial con dition of the city The board is extremely anxious to introduce greater unity into the method of keeping accounts As is clearly pointed out in one portion of the report one of the fundamental defects not only in our municipal reports but in public discussion of municipal finance is the failure to distinguish between income from money borrowed and from taxation and between money spent for current expenses and for permanent improvements Few statistics of value on this subject exist in this country and but little notice is practically taken of the difference Yet in the management of private business or large corporations a nice judgment of this question is tlhe very essence of success no one fact so readily affects the credit and standing of an individual or a corporation as do judgment and habits regarding this single point From the standpoint of true economics money raised by taxation is income and money spent for current expenses is an outgo while with borrowed money the process is reversedmoney borrowed becoming a charge and money spent on the plant becoming an asset There is consequently a vital error in classing money borrowed and taxes together as income and in classing current expenses and additions to plant together as expenditure The board suggests that city expenditures be examined with refer ence to some uniform classification of city functions As a tentative scheme the following plan is proposed I CENTRAL ORGANIZATION INCLUDING I Town or City Hall 4 Treasurer 2 Executive head 5 Clerk 3 Legislative head 6 Law department II PUBLIC SAFETY i Militia 5

PUBLIC RECREATION I Parks 4 Music 2 Playgrounds 5 Celebrations 3 Baths Another publication of the same department contains the statistics of municipal appropriations and actual expenditures of the ordinary revenue for the five years 1892 to 1897 inclusive It is the purpose of the board to publish a series which will furnish a detailed statement of municipal revenue and expenditure during recent years As a result of the material thus presented it will be possible to form an accurate estimate of the financial condition of the city of Boston Judging from the activity of the new board during the first nine months of its existence there is every reason to believe that it will soon be come one of the most useful branches of the city government Musical Commission The two latest additions to the very con siderable list of unpaid commissions and boards in charge of various branches of the city work are going to work energetically The Musical Commission is the latest of these bodies It was established to take charge of the music furnished by the city for free public enter tainment It is composed of five members all musical experts Carl Zerrahn is chairman John A OShea Jr vicechairman and J Thomas Baldwin secretary A municipal band has been organizedwith E N Catlin as leader and numerous openair concerts will be given through the summer in the public parks and elsewhere in all sections of the city A considerable economy in cost of public music is looked for and also a marked improvement in the character and quality of the music It is suggested that the band be also employed through the winter in giv ing free indoor concerts in various public halls Something like thirty years ago the city gave a series of free concerts in Music Hall They were very popular but the undertaking was abandoned on the ground that the city had no right to enter upon such activities  Communication of Sylvester Baxter Esq Malden Mass I51152 ANNALS OF THB AMERICAN ACADEMY Baths Commission The new Baths Commission has taken charge of all the public baths lately in charge of the Board of Health and the Park Commission A new model bathhouse has been built and others are projected A new beachbath has been established on Mystic River at the Charlestown Heights pleasure ground With one excep tion the wearing of proper bathingsuits at all public baths by men women and children and boys over fifteen years old has been ordered This is an innovation at the various floatingbaths for men and boys and seems hardly necessary The exception is the celebrated and immensely popular Lstreet beachbath for men and boys on Dor chester Bay South Boston This is the oldest municipal public bath in the country Here nude bathing has always been the rule and will continue An illustration of the picturesque scene at this bath was a feature of Scribners Magazine forJune The commission will make a charge of one cent for use of towels at all the baths and bathing suits will be sold at cost price For this purpose 300 bathing suits and 200 dozen trunks for men and boys have been ordered together with 6000 crash towels All employes at the baths are to be uniformed Swim ming lessons are to be given as a part of the public school course in physical training Park Boating Service The Boston Parks BoatService Company has been organized to carry on the boating in the waters of the public parks It has a large number of canoes rowboats and sailboats together with steamboats electric and other motor launches let at reasonable rates under regulations of the park department The company has been given a concession for three years for which it pays iooo a year The city has leased at a nominal rental sites for club houses to various yacht clubs at Marine Park the greatest yachting rendezvous in America BuffaloPublic School Investigation The visiting committee of the Buffalo School Association which was appointed in June I896 has published the results of its inquiry into the sanitary con dition of the citys schools The results are in many respects start ling proving the existence of conditions unworthy of a progressive community When we remember that nearly half the day of the average child is spent in the school the question of the environ ment as a purely educative factor becomes of tremendous import ance One of the greatest evils to which the committee directs attention is the overcrowded condition of most of the school buildings More than onehalf of the schools are using rooms as classrooms that were never intended for that purpose Basements attics and localities defective in ventilation and other sanitary requirements are filled with large classes Furthermore in manyNOTrS ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT of the schools there is not only a lack of schoolrooms but of seats as well In eighteen of the schools there are more pupils than desks requiring two children to sit at a single desk The majority of schoolrooms fail to furnish their occupants with the proper cubic air space The annexes are in a far worse condition They are for the most part rented buildings never designed for school pur poses and lacking in every sanitary requirement The committee furthermore found a most disgraceful condition existing in the dressingrooms lavatories etc It is safe to say that this report which has been widely circulated will do much to awaken public opinion to a sense of the danger of such conditions to the future health and welfare of the community Mayors Message The annual message of the mayor devotes con siderable space to the relation of the city to the corporations perform ing quasipublic services The recent agreement of the gas companies and the manipulation of franchise privileges which accompanied this change has aroused in the population a strong feeling of discontent The mayor recommends that an investigation into the operations of the gas company be made and that if no satisfactory understanding can be reached the provision of the charter of the city which authorizes the purchase construction maintenance and regulation of works to pro vide the city and its inhabitants with light be made effective The mayor recommends futhermore that application be made to the legis lature to authorize the city to issue bonds for the construction of a lighting plant IllinoisStreet Railway Franchise The Ninth Biennial Report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics contains an exhaustive discussion of the street railway franchises of the city of Chicago of the gas com panies operating in that city and an analysis of the Report of the Tax Commission appointed in I896 by the Hon George B Swift then mayor of Chicago Unfortunately for some reason or other the report has been badly cut up omissions are frequent and at times destroy the continuity of the discussion The reason assigned by the present head of the bureau Mr David Ross is that the report was limited in volume by the secretary of state to 300 pages This is hardly an excuse for cutting out important chapters and printing others in such a way as to destroy their internal relation to other portions of the report It is charged that the reasons for these changes have been purely political The report contains a great mass of valuable material particularly chapters on street railway franchises which we understand were pre pared by Professor E W Bemis After presenting a general discussion of the relation of the modern municipality to public services such as I53154 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the street railway gas etc and after making a comparison between the administrative organization of American and European cities the report enters upon an examination of the development of the street railway business in Chicago since 1856 the date at which street rail ways were first introduced The history of the growth of the street railway system especially the changes of the last ten years offers an example of changes in method of operation which have been almost revolutionary This remarkable growth of the street railway system together with the absence of all public control have furnished the opportunity to speculators to manipulate the various roads through skilful financiering in such a way as to lead to enormous overcapital ization The report clearly shows that the present cost of duplication is about onehalf of the capitalization of the roads and about onethird their approximate market value The per mile capitalization of the three great railway corporations of Chicago is as follows Chicago Street Railway   90216 West Chicago Street Railroad  149501 North Chicago StreetRailroad   46346 Average   126460 The capitalization of the Massachusetts street railways is 46600 It is evident that the high capitalization of the Chicago roads is due largely to the fact that the stock has been watered on a very large scale At the present time however this stock has to a considerable extent passed into the hands of innocent third parties The city therefore finds itself handicapped inasmuch as it is prevented by both the national and state constitutions from destroying vested interests Even if it were possible to reduce the capitalization it is more than probable that the persons most injured would be the innocent pur chasers of street railway stock The eniphasis of the evils consequent upon the absence of public control over corporations is a real service at the present time The author of the report however has failed to give to the promoters of street railway combinations due credit for the great improvements which they have introduced There is no doubt that the consolidation of the street railway lines has been the means of making possible improvements on a very large scale This is an advantage which should not be readily lost sight of It is true that these promoters have not had any direct interest in any public service they were performing As a matter of fact the business interests of these great corporations have led them to develop a street railway service which stands far above anything that European cities can at the present time offer While such improvement has been made at great cost to the community and while the public treasury of our municipalities sufferNoTEs ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT because of the failure to safeguard the financial interests of the city it cannot be denied that our citizens are enjoying the advantages of rapid transit and that each year brings with it some new addition to the facilities enjoyed The report on gas companies of Chicago previous to 1885 is a monograph which is full of the most valuable data on the history of this important class of public service corporations This portion of the report has been inserted out of its natural position as it requires some transposition of the material on the part of the reader in order to fully realize the wealth of the material presented This however has been no fault of the author but has been due to the carelessness or design of those in charge of the publication of the report The importance of this publication the great industry with which the facts have been collected and the ability with which they have been presented make it extremely desirable that the report be re printed in the form in which it was originally presented The manuscript as originally compiled contained the following chapters SUBJECT FRANCHISES AND TAXATION CONTENTSPART IFranchises Chapter IMonopolies Old and New Chapter IIStreet Railways Chapter IIIA FourCent Fare Chapter IVGas Chapter

Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics In the report as printed Chapters III V and part of Chapter VII have been omitted and the order of the other chapters changed FOREIGN CITIES BerlinElections The recently published statistics of local elections throw an interesting sidelight on the Prussian electoral system Up to the present time the government has been able to resist the demands for universal suffrage In Prussian municipal elections the threeclass electoral system is still maintained which gives to the wealthier classes a preponderant influence in local affairs In the elections for members of the municipal council the population is divided into three classes on the basis of state and local direct taxes Those paying the highest tax rate up to one third of the total sum constitute the electors of the first class the I55156 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY next highest rate whose combined taxes constitute a third of the total direct taxation constitute the second class and the remaining taxpayers are grouped in the third class of electors Under a recent registration it was found that in the city of Berlin there were 298978 electors classified as follows Electors of the First Class   1486  Second  9432    Third  288060 The electors of the first class include those who paid a minimum of i973 direct taxes All those paying between I95 and 973 con stitute the electors of the second class and all others paying direct taxes being included in the third class It will be seen from these figures that onethirtieth of the total electoral body elects twothirds of the municipal council for under the Prussian Municipal Corpo rations Act each electoral class elects onethird of the council Gas Works The report of the Berlin gas works for the year 189596 shows a remarkable increase in the consumption of gas par ticularly for heating and cooking purposes A reduction of I63 per cent in the price of gas for other than illuminating purposes imme diately caused an increase of 35 per cent in the consumption for such purposes Tile increased consumption necessitated considerable extensions in the city works which have now reached a high stage of efficiency The lMunicipal Savings Bank This institution at the end of March 1896 reports a total of more than fortyfour million dollars and a reserve fund of nearly three million dollars The total pay ments for the year 189596 amount to a little over ten million dollars At the present time the number of outstanding savings bank books is 543079 Street Railways For some time past the city has been negotiat ing with the street railway companies for the substitution of elec tricity for horse power At the present time a number of overhead and underground trolley lines have been introduced II July IS95 the city entered into a contract with a private corporation for the construction of an electric elevated road The street railway com panies are unwilling to make any considerable changes in their present system owing to the fact that their franchises will expire in a short time the lines then reverting to the city with option to purchase rolling stock It is probable that no radical changes will be made unless the city agrees to renew the franchises for a long period If this is not done the change will not be made until the city becomes full possessor of the street railway lines

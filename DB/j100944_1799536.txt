hDDITIONAL NOTICE FEB 23 1863 ness a stream of fresh water was constantly flowin Here therefore 7e had a confirmation of the observltions made by Dr Rinli which in this respect are not neww though he has brought it before us in a very prominent manner Dr RAE said one of the glaciers he visited had been evidently an icegiving off glacier at one time but the qnantity of mud formed from the trituration of the rock by iceaction and carried down by the rivers of which Dr Rink had spoken had probably filled up the head of the fiord so that the ice had not had depth of water enotlgh to float it off With reaard to the number of birds seen at the  sprirs  usually found near the edge af an iceblink the birds went there to feed on certain small nlarine insects resexnbling very minute shrimps which on the Arctic coast are almost invariably found where fresh water flows irlto the salt These insects being brought io tbe sulface by the flowing upwards of the fresh water through the salt in consequence of its less specific gravity are easily caught by the gulls and other svaterfowL hIr ROBERT CHAMBERS said in his opinion this Paper and tse former Paper of Dr Rink only partially illustrated the great glacial subject He thouJht this glacier spoken of resombled the suba3rial glaciers which are follnd in Alpine regions only that it nvas spread over a wider extellt of countly They had only to inlagine the sea about 30ao feet hither than it is round the Alps and they would have the Glacier du Bois discharging itself into the sea in the same way that this Greenland glacier was now doing What he wished lnore particularly to remark was that the early general glaciation of the northern reoions by which the surface of those countlies had 4een mouldeci and which was chronicled in Scotland by the boulder clay waPs in his opinion independent of such explanotions as this COLONSL SHAFFNER explained the diagrams he had prepared representin the various glaciers fiords and icebergs on the coast of Gleqnland The Meeting was then adjourned ADDITIONAL NOTICE Printed by order of Council 1 Extracts from a Letter of SAMUEL W BAKER Esq FRGS to Rear Admiral the Hon HENRY MURRWAY Dated Xhartum 24th Lov 1862  THE steamer engaCed by the adventurous Dutch ladies returned from Gondokoro on the 19th instant bringing unsatisfactory news of Petherick He left Abookooka in the Eytch country about the 15th Ju The steamer left this spot about 31st last month October thus three mcYnths and a haf had elapsed sillce Pethericks departure From Abookooka he had been obliDi to force porters for the land jourrIey He left the greater portion of his stores at Poncets depot at that place and returned to Khartum three boats with an immense amount of eSects damaged by the rains Instead of proceeding direct to Gondokoro from Abookooka as I had supposed by a route said to be firm ground he went to his ivory establishment in the Jamberra on the Djour in a xsw direction This route is said to be almost impassable duriIlD the rains as the tlact of country is intersected by numerous large hoes or rivers and deep morassesa which ale at that season flooded SinceFEB 23 1863 ADDITIONAL NOTICE his departure only three or four of the large number of his porters have 79 returned to Abookooka and they reported the cotmtry to be in a flooded state and that it was imossible to proceed i tnost likely these rascals had bolted Beyond tllis there was no news  In this country beyond all others success in exploration depends upon a knowledge and choiceof seasons delay is fatal The northwiIld is fickle until about the 20th November and even then its force is hardly felt beyond the Sobat junction Boats leavint this on the 1st December are said to reach Gondokoro as soon as those which stalt a fortnight earlier as they carry the wind with them throughout the route The rains which do not set in here until Auust commcnce at Gondokoro and further south early in April Thus a successil passate to Lake Nyanza depends upon a start from Gondo lXoro not later tllan 1st February Leaving Khartum on lt December I should be at the foot of the cataract beyond Gosldokorv by the 20th January i e fifty days including stoppages for observations at the Sobat and Bahr Gazal junctions This cataract is nine hours steaming from Gondokoro by the account kept by the Dutch ladies and the river is very free from windings S thus the last point to be reached b boats must be upon the fourth degree of s lat as nearly as possible or about 50 miles south of Gondokoro I shall only remain at Gondokoro a couple of days to discharge my store of corn at the depot and I shall at once ptlsh oll to the cJataract and there disembark Without losint a day zmnecessarily I shall then march for the Nile sources  The actual distance from the cataract not eseeeding 240 geographical miles allowinc 20 per cent fordeviations of route will make the jourlley to the equator about 340 statute miles Say that I leave the cataract on the 1st February and that near the equator the rains begin on the lSth March  I have some forty days dry weather to depend upon which should bring nle there without dfficultythe averaoe beinffl under 9 miles per diem At the last point attainable before the rainKs I shall make a fortified camp and nzake all snuffl for men and beasts DurinC the fine intervals in the wet season I shall make excursions to all points leavina half my men at the headquartels If I get into a good shootillg country I have no fear as the excitement of tle chase and the abundant supply of flesh keeps all men in good humour and ensures the friendship of the natives  I have worked incessantly to arrange my expedition with order The great difficulty in these countries is to establish a regular discipline amona the merl Forty of my men are armed with doublebarrelled gUllS and rifles  fortyfive form the escort includina one captain and four chourkes one of the latter to every ten men I have put them all in uniform without which it is inapossible to discipline thena  there is one drllmmer and one ensign and I can safely say that a greater set of blackguards never followed the EnClish flag One great blessitlg in my intended route is this i when once past the ivory traders establishments my men dare not desert as the natives would murder them on the road back I have expended mllch trouble in procurinC transportanimals including horses camels donkeys and mules but I has e been disappointed in the expected purchase of ten of the latter7 and they are difficult to procure In all I have twentyeiaht animals and 1 shall take another couple of donkeys in the cabin if I cannot firld room for them else where With thirty animals I casl travel independently of porters who ale the curse of explorations The instrtlments you kindly lent me are in excellent order I have three watches which I pack in cotton wool secured in a small tinbos thlls I trust they will keep their health but there is a regular epidemic amonO watches in these parts s Froln inquiries I have made of traders black white and brown I am ofADDITIONAL NOTICE 80 FEB 23 863 opinion that the source of the Nile will be found as nearly as possible tIyon the Equator I do not believe that the Lake Nyanza has anything to do with the river The latter must be the eSects of innumerable drains from high lands on this side north of the lake I expect to arrive at a network of mountain torrents which though dry at certain periods bring the entire rainfall of the mountains to the nzain river during the wet season  The Atbara brings to the Nile the rainfall of Abyssinia supplied by the Settite or Tacazzy the Salaam and Angarep rivers The Rahad and Dinder also drain the westerly portion of the Abyssinian range into the Blue Nile while the latter brings the main supply from the mountains adjoiIling the Galla frontier The Sobat without doubt rises in the southwesterly corners of the Galla country bordering the Berri as the ivory hunters speak of a lix er about eighteen days journey east of Goniokoro This must be one of the Sol1at arteries coming from tbe same elevated land shich supplies the WnWhite River direct The Djour runs parallel with the White River west from Gondokoro evidently noming from the same hiah land Thus btr analogy one nay presunle that the main Nile is supplied by the northern watershed of the great chain of highlands running through Abyssinia the Galla country and equato rial Africa and that the Nyanza and other lakes of Central Africa are reservoirs from the southern watershed of the same highlands at a level so low that there is no escape for the accumulated waters  The Sobat runs out so suddenly upot the cessation of the rains that a boat i8 left in the mlld without depth of Yvater for a return to the White Nile Tllis proves that equatorial mountaintorrents suptly that river in my opinion the NlVhite Nile has a similar origin The steamer with the exploring Dutch ladies La Baronne Tinne her sister and dauhter has been unahle to ascend thf3 Sobat for want of fuel Its course is through vast treeless plains of hith grass With determined pluck they used all their furniture for fuel in the hopes of reaching some spot of forest but at length with exhausted fires they floated slowly to the White Nile

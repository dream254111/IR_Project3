VERNIER AND WILLIAM G HALE CONTEMPT Toledo Newspaper Co v U S 38 Sup Ct Repr 560 Obstruction of Justice by Newspaper Judicial Code Act March 3 1911 c 231 Sec 268 36 Stat 1163 Comp St 1916 Sec 1245 first enacted as Act March 2 1831 c 99 4 Stat 487 which declares that courts shall have the power to punish contempts of their authority provided that such power shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the misbehavior of any person in their presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice confers no power not already granted and imposes no limitations not already existing but merely marks the boundaries of existing authority and conformably to the whole history of the country recognized and sanctioned the existence of the power of federal courts to restrain acts tending to obstruct and prevent the untrammeled and unprejudiced exercise of the judicial power so the publica tion of newspaper articles which tend to obstruct the administration of justice may be treated as a contempt Newspaper articles referring to a suit in the federal court to enjoin municipal ordinances regulating street car fares which held the federal judge up to ridicule and hatred in case he should grant an injunction and in advance impeached his motives in so doing and practically urged noncompliance with any such order must be deemed acts tending to obstruct the administra tion of justice within Judicial Code Sec 268 and punishment for contempt cannot be avoided on the ground that it did not appear the judge saw the articles or that he was unaffected by them Mr Justice Holmes and Mr Justice Brandeis dissenting CONSTITUTIONAL LAW State v Cook W Va 95 S E 792 Equal protection of the laws excluding persons of African descent from jury Whenever by any action of a state whether through its Legislature through its courts or through its executive or administrative officers all persons of the African race are excluded solely because of their race or color from serving as grand or petit jurors in the criminal prosecution of a person of the African race the equal protection of the laws is denied to him contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States The fact that there were no persons of African descent upon the grand jury such indictment or upon the petit jury summoned for the purpose of trying the defendant does not of itself show the exclusion of such persons solely because of race or color CORPORATIONS State v Lehigh Valley R Co N J 103 Atl 685 Crimilal liability of corporation for manslaughter426 JUDICIAL DECISIONS A corporation aggregate may be held criminally for manslaughter An indictment in the statutory form charging a corporation aggregate with manslaughter will not be quashed for failure to specify whether voluntary or involuntary manslaughter is meant EMBEZZLEMENT U S v Wertzel 38 Sup Ct Repr 381 Agent A receiver of a national bank appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency under Rev St Sec 5234 Comp St 1916 Sec 9821 being an officer of the United States instead of the bank is not an agent of the bank within section 5209 Comp St 1916 Sec 9772 denouncing the offense of embezzlement and making false entries by every president director cashier teller clerk or agent of a national bank the conclusion being strengthened by the principle of noscitur a sociis in view of the position of the word agent in the section Statutes creating and defining crimes are not extended by intendment because the court thinks the Legislature should have made them more com prehensive Therefore Rev St Sec 5209 denouncing the offense of embezzle ment or making false entries by a president director cashier teller clerk or agent of a national bank cannot by implication be extended so as to embrace receivers appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency on the ground that otherwise there would be no statute applying to embezzlement by such receivers EVIDENCE State v Gilligan Conn 103 Atl 649 Proof of intent to poison by proof of other crimes Where accused keeper of house for old people secretly borrowed money from an inmate who was poisoned and proof of other killings by accused of inmates by poison were inadmissible evidence of financial transactions and purchases of poison connected only with such other killings was also inadmissible Roraback and Wheeler JJ dissenting from reasoning of opinion EXTRADITION Taft v Lord Conn 103 Atl 644 Fugitive from Justice Where a husband and father who had married in New York state resided there with his wife and had children born to him left the state to go to Connecticut to find work giving his wife money for her and the childrens maintenance until he could send them more or bring them to Connecticut and after he found work in Connecticut sent on for his wife and children and established them in his home in Connecticut which they later left returning to New York on account of a quarrel after which the husband sent the wife no money for her support or the support of the children such husband was not a fugitive from justice from New York to Connecticut within Const U S Art 4 Sec 2 justifying his arrest by the executive authority of Connecticut for rendition to New York on its demand on indictment for abandonment since no one can be considered a fugitive from justice and extraditable as such who has not either committed some crime in the demanding state or done therein some overt act intended to be a 426 JUDICIAL DECISIONSJUDICIAL DECISIONS 427 material step in the accomplishment of a crime subsequently consummated somewhere To constitute one a fugitive from justice within Const U S Art 4 Sec 2 as to the rendition of such fugitives between states the person having been in the one state must have left it and come within the jurisdiction of the other state and must have incurred guilt before he left the one state and while bodily present in it and one who is without the jurisdiction of the one state when he is wanted there to answer a criminal charge does not by his absence alone become a fugitive from justice nor does he from the mere fact that he has rendered himself liable to criminal prosecution in that state INDETERMINATE SENTENCE People v Lee Calif 172 Pac 158 California statute construed Under Pen Code Sec 1168 added by St 1917 p 665 providing for indeterminate sentence not greater than maximum nor less than minimum of the term fixed for the particular offense a sentence of one convicted of manslaughter to from one to ten years imprisonment is erroneous in view of section 193 fixing a maximum imprisonment for manslaughter of ten years but fixing no minimum term People v Hall Calif 172 Pac 1116 Effect of error in applying inde terminate sentence law Where an offense was committed before the indeterminate sentence law took effect an indeterminate sentence cannot be given A conviction will not be reversed for error in giving an indeterminate sentence for an offense committed before the indeterminate sentence law went into effect but the case will be remanded with instructions to give a proper sentence INDICTMENT Knight v State Ga 95 S E 679 Specifying means used in homicide Where an indictment alleged that the accused killed a woman by shooting her with a certain pistol and with a certain rifle it was not error to overrule a demurrer based on the ground that the homicide was charged as committed with two different instruments alleged conjunctively that it is physically impossible to kill a person with a gun and a pistol at the same time and that one of them alone must have produced the death Walker v State 141 Ga 525 81 S E 442 and authorities cited State v Rubin N J 103 Atl 390 Description of stolen goods indefiniteness An indictment for stealing or receiving knowing it to have been stolen 125 pounds of brass is not bad for indefiniteness because not specifying nature and form of the brass the assumption that brass cannot exist in an unmanufactured state or at least without having been given some specific form being untenable INSANITY Polk x State Ga 95 S E 988 Burden of proof Exception is taken to the following charge to the jury The law pre sumes every man sane until it is made to appear to the contrary that he is insane or of unsound mind And if a man files that plea the burden is on JUDICIAL DECISIONS 427428 JUDICIAL DECISIONS him to make it appear to the satisfaction of the jury it ought to be made to appear to a reasonable certainty that at the time of the commission of the act if any he did not know the nature and quality of the act or if he did know he did not know the act was wrong The error assigned is that the charge placed upon the defendant a greater burden than the law requires the court put upon the defendant the burden to make it appear to a reasonable certainty that the accused was insane when the true rule is merely that the defendant must show insanity by the preponderance of evidence The homicide was admitted The sole defense was insanity at the time of the commission of the homicide The defendant offered no evidence whatever he relied upon his statement alone The court charged the jury as follows If after a full fair and honest examination of this evidence in connection with the defendants statement your minds are unsettled unsatisfied do not know what the truth about it is then that is what is called a reasonable doubt in law and you should give him the benefit of that reasonable doubt and acquit him Held that the criticism of the instruction excepted to is well taken but under the facts of the case and in view of the subsequent charge last quoted and the whole charge the error pointed out is not such as to require a reversal INSTRUCTIONS State v Worley W Va 96 S E 56 Reasonable doubt An instruction attempting to define the term reasonable doubt and concluding with these words addressed to the jury if you doubt as men you should doubt as jurors if you do not doubt as men you should not doubt as jurorsshould be refused INTOXICATING LIQUORS State v One Packard Automobile Okla 172 Pac 66 Seizure and for feiture of automobile under statute appurtenance An automobile used April 27 1916 in the unlawful conveyance of intoxi cating liquor in the presence of an officer having power to serve criminal process was not subject to seizure by such official and forfeiture to the state under the provision of section 3617 Rev Laws 1910 and is not an appur tenance within the meaning of that section which provided When a violation of any provision of this chapter chapter 39 Intoxicating Liquors shall occur in the presence of any sheriff constable marshal or other officer having power to serve criminal process it shall be the duty of such officer without warrant to arrest the offender and seize the liquor bars furniture fixtures vessels and appurtenances thereunto belonging so unlawfully used Brett J dissenting OBSCENITY State v Payne Okla 172 Pac 1096 Under section 2403 Rev Laws 1910 making it a misdemeanor to utter or speak and obscene    or lascivious language or word in any public place or in the presence of females or in the presence of children under ten years of age the language used need not necessarily consist of words obscene or lascivious per se but where the information sets out the language although it may be composed of words which are not in themselves either obscene or 428 JUDICIAL DECISIONSJUDICIAL DECISIONS 429 lascivious yet if the sense and and meaning of the words employed is either obscene or lascivious the information is sufficient to state the offense where all other allegations necessary to complete said offense are contained therein PROSTITUTION State v Kelly Wash 172 Pac 1175 Statutory construction every person Every person as used in Rem Code 1915 Sec 2440 providing that every person who shall live with or accept any earnings of a common prosti tute etc shall be punished etc includes females as well as males STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS Pitts v State Ga 95 S E 935 When statute begins to run in bigamy case It is marrying or going through the form of marriage which the law has enjoined as requisite to the creation of the marital relation by a person who has a husband or wife living with knowledge of such fact that constitutes the offense of bigamy under our statute and the offense is completed upon the second marriage Subsequent cohabitation is not a necessary element in the offense nor will subsequent cohabitation render it a continuing offense so as to fix the time of cessation of the cohabitation as the point from which the statute of limitations will begin to run TRIAL People v Webster Calif 172 Pac 768 Conduct of counsel There can be no excuse for flagrantly improper conduct of assistant district attorney in referring to prior conviction for similar offense after the court had stricken out all reference thereto and in saying what he would do had prosecutrix in rape case been his daughter But such error was harmless where the record of defendants guilt was very clear and convincing WITNESSES McWhorter v State Ga 95 S E 1013 Judicial endorsement Upon the trial of this case several police officers testified for the state and none for the defendant The defendants conviction was not demanded by the evidence Under these facts it was error requiring the grant of a new trial for the court to charge the jury as follows But the fact that a man is an officer is nothing against him We rely upon these officers This is true even though in immediate connection with this charge the judge tells the jury I charge you the fact that a man is a detective or police officer should not discredit his testimony It goes to his credit that he is actively engaged in the prosecution of the case    and the fact that they the detectives and police officers receive money from people for recovering their property which has been stolen is a fact which you may consider If they get money in any case for the purpose of securing a conviction or if a conviction depends on their evidence it should go to their credit and largely to their credit For the pre siding judge in his charge to designate a class of witnesses and to tell the jury We rely upon them is to give to these officer witnesses judicial indorse ment and approval and  to give an improper potency to the influence of their testimony Civil Code 1910 Sec 4863 Potter v State 117 Ga 693 695 696 698 45 S E 37 Alexander v State 114 Ga 266 2 267 268 40 S E 231 Pound v State 43 Ga 88 90 7 JUDICIAL DECISIONS 429430 INNOCENT AND ARRESTED BY MISTAKECAN THE RECORD BE DESTROYED That an innocent person arrested through mistake has no right to have the record of the arrest made by the police under statutory authority cancelled or destroyed is held in the Michigan case of Miller v Gillespie 163 N W 22 L R A 1917 E 774 This case seems to be the first to have directly passed upon the question of the right of one who has been arrested to have the record of such arrest as made and retained for possible future reference by the police surrendered for cancellation However the denial of a right to have such record destroyed is in keeping with the weight of authority upon the closely allied question of the right to take and retain in a rogues gallery the picture of one accused of crime before convictionJOSEPH MATTHEW SULLIVAN Boston Mass REFORMATORIES NOT PENAL INSTITUTIONS Webb U S Attorney General State of California Opinion as to whether state reformatories may be classed as penal institutions with reference to com pliance with provisions of Section 6 Chapter 723 Statutes of 1917 This chap ter creates a State Bureau of Criminal Identification repealing an earlier act covering the same subject matter By Section 6 of the act it is provided that the board of managers of said bureau shall keep on file a record of all meas urements photographs and descriptions of persons confined in state penal in stitutions That there was intended to exist a distinction between a penal insti tution and a reformatory is in part ascertainable from the language of Section 2 Article X Constitution of California referring to the powers of the State Board of Prison Directors The latter are given the charge of the state prisons and to them are delegated such powers in respect to other penal and reforma tory institutions of the state as prescribed by the legislature The general law on the subject of state prisons is found in Title I Part III of the Penal Code and designates the two prisons as San Quentin and Folsom The acts establishing the Preston School of Industry Statutes of 1889 page 100 and the Whittier State School Statutes of 1889 amended by Statutes of 1893 page 238 are shown to be for the purpose of providing schools for the disci pline education and employment of juvenile delinquents The theory of the Juvenile Law enacted by Statutes of 1915 page 1225 is to separate juvenile and adult offenders The two schools come within the meaning of Section 24 of said act as desirable places to which such children may be sent It was held in the case of Ex Parte Ah Peen 51 Cal 280 that the committing of a minor to the industrial school department of San Francisco did not amount to a criminal prosecution but that it was intended to train the child so that his future might be useful when reclaimed to society In the case of Ex Parte Liddell 93 Cal 633 the law creating the Whittier State School was held con stitutional It was therein decided 1 the legislature has power to provide for the detention and education of juvenile offenders and 2 that the object of the act is not punishment but reform discipline and education It observed that the conditions surrounding a child are vastly different than if sent to a state prison or county jail It was pointed out He is given the opportunity and instruction to learn a trade and qualify himself for the duties of citizen ship The court differentiated between being in a state prison and in a reform school and pointed out that if boys are honorably discharged are released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offenses or crimes for JUDICIAL DECISIONSJUDICIAL DECISIONS 431 which they are committed The exact language contained in these lines of reasoning was employed with approval in the case of Ex Parte Nichols 110 Cal 651 which held as constitutional the act establishing Preston School of Industry Definiti6ns of the words penal and reformatory as laid down by standard legal authority and cited in the opinion indicate that the law recog nizes a distinction between a penal institution and a reformatory In all legislation affecting this bureau nothing is included requiring such information to be furnished by the superintendents of the reform schools but the Statutes of 1909 page 398 and now in force direct that the wardens of the state prisons shall send to the legalized Bureau of Identification such information The opinion concludes with the following statements Therefore the said prisons being named and the reformatories not referred to we see an additional reason for believing that there was no intention to require the reformatories to furnish these records to your bureau State Bureau of Criminal Identifica tion and Investigation Therefore the Whittier and Preston reformatories are not to be classed as penal institutions and as being required to comply with this provision The foregoing opinion was given in a letter addressed to me by Attorney General U S Webb under date of February 28 1918FRED C NELLES Super intendent Whittier State School

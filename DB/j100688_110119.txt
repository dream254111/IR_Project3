Construction Abstract,i207044,ing and the author describes the general appearances of the diseased parts among which ossification of the arterial trunks was prevalent He trusts that he has proved that coagulation of the blood in an aneurismal sac by the means pointed out in this paper is not only practicable but that it may be resorted to without the production of any important local or constitutional symptoms Sir Everard next details the results of several experiments made with a view of ascertaining the effects of various temperatures upon the spontaneous coagulation of the blood The separation of serum he finds considerably impeded by a high temperature but by a heat of 1200 the blood is rendered buffy and if drawn from the arm into a cup immersed in boiling water and kept for some hours at that temperature it does not form a complete coagulum A low tempe rature also interferes with its perfect coagulation for when drawn into a cup immersed in ice and left there in twentyfour hours the surface had a buffy coat and the coagulum was extremely loose It has been generally believed that the cupped appearance of blood depends upon the coagulable lymph being more contractile when se parated from than when blended with the other parts of the blood In a patient who suffered under inflammation of the brain and who was bled in the course of thirteen days to the amount of sixtyeight ounces some of the blood though very buffy was not at all cupped Its appearance was very peculiar and the coagulum was divided into an upper dense portion having the characters of coagulated albu men while the lower portion had a gelatinous appearance and ex hibited the albumen in a very attenuated state mixed with the colouring matter On the mnathematical Theory of Suspension Bridges with Tables for facilitating their Construction By Davies Gilbert Esq VPRS c Communicated March 9 1826 Read March 9 1826 Phil Trans 1826 Part III p 202 In this paper the author states that his attention was first directed to a consideration of suspension bridges when the plan for the Menai Bridge was submitted to the Commissioners of Roads and Bridges It then appeared to him that the proposed depth of curvature was in sufficient for insuring a due degree of strength and this opinion was confirmed by some investigations which are printed in the Quarterly Journal of Science In consequence of this the interval between the roadway and the points of support has been augmented to 50 feet and its strength now appears sufficient The object of this paper is the expansion of the formulae from which the abovementioned approximation was derived into tables adapted to general use and the derivation of other formulae and tables for the catenary of equal strength a curve not merely of spe culative curiosity but of practical use when bridges of very wide span are to be constructed The author first remarks that as all catenaries270 like circles parabolas c are similar curves tables constructed for one value of the parameter apply to all by simple proportion He then enters into an analytical investigation of the equations suited for his purpose and finally concludes his paper with four tables The first consists of six columns and contains correspond ing values of the parameter the exponential function or inverse logarithm of the span divided by the parameter the versed sine the length the tension at the point of support and the angle of suspen sionall computed for a semispan of 100 parts for the ordinary catenary and for a parameter varying from 1000 to 2000 Table 2 contains the same quantities for a constant parameter 100 and for all values of the semispan from 1 to 100 Table 3 is adapted to the catenary of equal strength and corre sponds to Table 1 in the ordinary catenary the constant span being 100 and the parameter varying from 70 to 1000 with an additional column expressing the weight of the whole curve while Table 4 exhibits the same things for this curve arranged in the order of Table 2 By the aid of these Tables all the requisite particulars may easily be found in any case proposed in practice On Magnetic Influence in the Solar Rays By Samuel Hunter Christie Esq IMA FRS of Trinity College Carmbridge Fellow of the Cambridge Philosophical Society of the Royal Military Academy Communicated November 15 1825 Read January 19 1826 Phil Trans 1826 Part III p 219 The object of this communication is to show by a series of expe riments that the suns rays possess sensible magnetic properties which are observable in the vibrations of a magnetic needle exposed to them independent of their heating effect and also to point out the changes which take place in the intensity of a needles mag netism from changes of temperature as deduced from its times of vibration The main fact noticed by the author indicative of a magnetic in fluence in the solar rays is thisthat a magnetic needle vibrating exposed to the rays of the sun comes to rest more quickly than when vibrating in the shade A needle six inches long contained in a brass compassbox with a glass cover was suspended by a fine hair and made to vibrate alternately shaded and exposed to the sun The shade was pro duced by a wooden screen supported four feet above the box It was then found that setting off from the same point the 100th vibration could be very distinctly noted in the shade but none further than the 75th in the sun So far too from the increase of temperature in the needle having caused the vibrations to be per formed slower in the latter case they were actually executed some what more rapidly

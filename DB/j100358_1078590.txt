University High School University of Chicago Methods of stimulating readingMuch of the success of inducing pupils to read depends on the methods employed by the teacher In the communitylife course for example it has been found useful when taking up a new topic to spend the entire first period in running over the new book list with the pupils for the purpose of arousing their interest in some of the titles As a rule some of the books have previously been read by members of the class a few enthusiastic words from them count for more in creating a desire to read a particular book than a long eulogy from the teacher On the other hand an anecdote about the author or a brief descrip tion of the character or contents of a book from the instructor often proves an effective stimulus It is a good plan also to have some of the books in the room where they can be shown to the class while the teacher talks about them or their authors for there is magic in the very appearance of a book possessing an attractive format Better still as constituting a lure which is wellnigh irresistible is the reading aloud of a choice passage in a book stop ping of course in the manner of a serial at the most exciting point leaving the outcome of the episode or the mystery undivulged In this connection further comment should be made about the assistance which has been given by the pupils in building up the bibliographies After a new bibliography has been discussed Part I described the administration organization and chief objectives of a combination course in communitylife English which has been carried on in the laboratory schools of the University of Chicago during the last four years The types of reading material used the amount of reading done by the pupils and the necessity of having an abundant and varied supply of interesting and worthy books were considered II8COMMUNITY LIFE AND ENGLISH Ig9 the pupils are asked to suggest other titles suitable for the list They are told that any reference worthy of being added to the bibliography should have two qualities first it should relate to the topic in hand and second it should possess literary merit Every book suggested by the pupils is subjected therefore to critical examination The instructor of course does not summarily reject titles which are not worth whilesuch action would speedily destroy any desire pupils might have to make contributions On the contrary all proposals are submitted for the consideration of the class If the book is familiar its merits and its rights to a place on the list are discussed If it is unknown the pupil suggesting it explains its character briefly and the discussion follows The pupils have thus contributed many valuable suggestions A motive has also been furnished for reading as well as an unusual op portunity for cultivating a discriminating taste for good literature As a rule decision by the teacher is unnecessary If consider able doubt exists among the members of the class concerning the literary merits of a book it is placed on the list tentatively and several pupils are asked to read it It was of such a book The Girls of Morning Glory Camp Fire that one of the girls reported I liked this story in a way for I have never read many like it and it is a pleasure to try some different kinds of stories occasionally but it was told in such a flowery affected way that I tired of it quickly As an illustration of a class session of the sort described the following extract from the written report of an observer is of interest The teacher was not conducting a regular recitation but had asked the pupils to bring to class the names of imaginative books relating to Recrea tion  the next topic in their course I was interested in the choice of books which the children offered One boy recommended the High School Boys Series by Hancock The instructor did not condemn the selection but inti mated that he was rather suspicious of series books He then asked the opinion of the class concerning them One girl in a deprecatory tone pro nounced them silly hero books in which one boy always got into trouble and then came out with flying colors A boy rather naively described them as all right to read aside from school work and added that he did not think they were good literature Similar discussions occurred over such books as Catty Atkins Mark Tidd in the Backwoods and The Real Diary of a Real Boy120 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February On the other hand Mark Twains Roughing it and Some Rambling Notes of an Idle Excursion and Booth Tarkingtons Penrod and Seventeen were eagerly welcomed The discussion showed that the pupils were beginning to dis tinguish between good literature and mediocre In cases which the instructor thought doubtful the titles were placed on the book list with a question mark after them and the pupils who had suggested them were asked to bring the books to school in order that the other members of the class might read and pass judgment upon them Methods of checking readingAlthough the initial stimulus in getting boys and girls to read is of great importance it is even more essential not to chill or destroy their enthusiasm by laborious and distasteful checking methods For example the practice of re quiring long formal book reports or reviews which is followed in some schools usually dulls and occasionally ends interest in reading To know that at the completion of a book there is the task of writing a paper about it often takes away much of the joy in reading it indeed such a rule if applicable to all books read operates as a penalty for extensive readingthe more books read the more reviews required In short if wide reading be a major objective in a course a checking method of this kind is one of the most certain means of preventing its accomplishment To avoid this pitfall and at the same time to provide effective methods of checking the reading a number of devices have been used in the communitylife classes One of these devices is to require pupils to make out for each reference read a 3 X 5 or 5 X 7 card containing answers to the following questions What is this article or book about  How does it relate to the topic  Did you like it If so what did you like in it If not what did you dislike in it  Not why did you like or dislike it  By limiting answers on any one reference to a single card the back as well as the face of the card may be used not only is conciseness of state ment put at a premium and a muchneeded phase of instruction in composition provided but the requirement is prevented from be coming burdensome An example of the better type of reading card slightly edited for the present purpose is presented on page 2 I Each pupil has a small filing case in which he keeps his cards classified by topic and by author From time to time the cards are handed in to the instructor usually as work on a given topic1922 COMMUNITY LIFE AND ENGLISH 121 draws to an end Unless there are errors which call for correction the cards are not returned An index of the interest which they arouse appears in the considerable proportion of the pupils who make copies for their own use In more than one instance the habit thus begun of recording the impressions of their reading has continued long after the completion of the communitylife course In addition to their value as a checking device the reading cards serve several useful purposes Tabulations of answers to the third question for instance furnish substantial evidence of the Riis Jacob Pupils Name Neighbors 1209 i This book is a collection of short stories about our poor and often foreign neighbors who live in the tenement district Each story describes vividly the hardships of these people and the poor conditions under which they live 2 These stories deal with the topic of immigration in story form They bring the reader right down to where he can understand the struggles of immigrants in an intimate way They show the need of a helping hand among these people 3 This book was the first of its kind I ever read I found it extremely interesting as the stories were all taken from real life although some of them have little point other than to illuminate the conditions in the tenements appeal which the references make to the pupils They thus lead constantly to improvements in the bibliographies Moreover by placing the better reports in a filing case in the school library where they are readily accessible to pupils or by reading them to the class the cards prove invaluable in stimulating reading The reports also demonstrate in a conclusive way the wide variation between the reading tastes and capacities of different pupils in the same grade One pupil says of Mary Antins At School in the Promised Land I liked the book immensely because it was written in such a simple quaint way another comments I dont like it at all A very lovely poem is the opinion of122 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February one pupil of Laniers When Love Looked for Hell I didnt care much for it because it was very hard to understand says another Of Rosss The Old World in the New one boy writes My interest was held almost throughout this book because the author has so much to say a second says Very deep yet interestingfrom this chapter I learned very much about our forefathers a girl comments I liked this book very muchit tells of the different traits of the immigrants to this country another girl reports I didnt care much for it because it is mostly all facts While most ninthgrade pupilsthe preceding quota tions are all from ninthgraderswere beyond their depth in Wordsworths Intimations of Immortality now and then one would report I enjoyed it or I found it very beautiful These differences in taste emphasize the need of exposing pupils to a great variety of books if habits of extensive reading are to be promoted There are of course references on which general approval or disapproval was occasionally expressed For example Roosevelts Letters to His Children almost universally received com ments like the following Interesting all through I liked it because it was very humorous in parts I enjoyed these letters very much because they showed a different side of Roosevelt This is a lovely book and a good illustration of family life A book every American should read  I enjoyed it immensely But even with a book like this as if to emphasize the point made there was an occasional pupil who as one boy put it thought the book rather dry and did not finish it A second method of checking which proves at the same time to be an incentive to reading is the symposium Now and then during the study of a topicin most instances from two to three weeks are spent upon each unita class period or a portion of a period is set aside to permit the pupils to talk over the reading they are doing in an informal conversational manner This opportunity for exchanging opinions criticisms questions and suggestions makes the symposium a natural and interesting occasion and enables the teacher incidentally to discover what and how the children are reading As the time devoted to the study of a topic draws to an end a third method of checking is afforded by an exercise in oral com1922 COMMUNITY LIFE AND ENGLISH 123 position Each pupil is asked to prepare a somewhat formal talk of from two to five minutes in length on some phase of his reading Since a floortalk as this exercise is called is primarily a matter of oral composition the discussion of it will be deferred to the succeeding article A written exercise which is occasionally employed to supplement or to take the place of the floortalk also proves a useful checking device At the conclusion of the work on a given topic the pupils are asked to hand in with their readings a card called the Pre liminary Summary Card This card contains a list of the readings author title and pages which have been done in connection with the study of the topic At the left of the authors name each pupil indicates by the figures i and 2 the two books which he has enjoyed most He is asked to write a brief paper from fifty to one hundred and fifty words about one of these books Since his selection will naturally be his favorite it is usually suggested that he comment on the book in such a way as to make others desire to read it An idea of how well pupils sometimes succeed in this effort may be obtained from the following paper on Spearmans The Nerve of Foley This paper is given in the language of the boy who wrote it with the exception of the omission of one word and the change of another Toot toot The engine of the flyer approaches the grade crossing All of a sudden a horse and buggy with only a baby in it is seen on the crossing only a hundred yards ahead of the train If the horse remains still the carriage containing the baby will be safe if it moves six inches one way or the other death will certainly overtake the child Not hesitating a moment but with a sure stepah but thats a secret Read The Nerve of Foley and find out what happens to the baby Rushing along at seventy miles an hour is a flyera special containing a man who is speeding to Denver on a life or death mission But what is that aheid  The bridge is afire If the train can cross it will get to Denver in time if not the chances are that it will be too late The flames are eating up the bridge Does the engineer apply the emergency brake  Or does he open the throttle wider  Does the child in Denver who is in such a critical condi tion die  or does he live The Nerve of Foley will tell you You have missed a rare treat if you do not read this book Assignment and home workThe management of assignments and home work has a notable effect on the reading done After124 THE SCHOOL REVIEW February several experiments assignments of work to be done outside the classroom have been entirely discontinued in the communitylife course except as explained in the following paragraph The study of the text which forms the essential and unifying core of the course the making of outlines and summaries the writing and correcting of themes are all done in the classroom during the regular class period Pupils who fall behind in their work through sickness incapacity or lack of application are required to make up their work usually in a study class at the end of the day at home or in the case of prolonged absence from school by private tutoring The class hour thus becomes primarily a period for work Recitations as the term is commonly employed do not obtain Only at the beginning of the study of a topic when the book lists are discussed and toward the end when floortalks and themes are given are group activities predominant At other times with the exception of occasional informal discussions explanations and debates the work is for the most part individual in character the teacher employing the class period in diagnosing the difficulties of individual pupils and in prescribing or suggesting specific remedies to overcome these difficulties The confining of work or study to the class period leaves the pupils free to follow other interests outside the classroom In the communitylife course they are told at the beginning of the semester that they are expected to give an average of half an hour a day to reading from the titles on the book list All of the members of the class are occasionally asked to read certain specific references while the advantage of reading some selections in each of the three groups on the book list is emphasized but as a rule pupils are allowed to read in accordance with their own tastes The books not in the recitation rooms are placed for convenience on reserved shelves in the library Here pupils are told to browse until they find a book which interests them The opinion of the various classes has generally been that one frequently cannot discover whether a book is likely to prove interesting until he has gone through a chapter or two Although pupils are encouraged to read as extensively as their time permitsand the figures previously given afford evidence that the halfhour minimum is greatly exceededevery precaution1922 COMMUNITY LIFE AND ENGLISH 125 is taken to prevent the setting up of wrong motives This point deserves emphasis for any activity which is subjected to quanti tative measurementbe it sewing on buttons laying bricks writing term papers or reading bookshas in it a constant tempta tion to shoddy work In order to guard against this danger pupils are told repeatedly that while the teacher is interested in having them read as much as they can without neglecting their other school work he is much more interested in their reading well what they do read They are told that their grades do not depend on the amount of reading they do In a number of instances in fact the grades of pupils with large reading totals have fallen below those of others who read but half as much and in no case has a pupil failed for a lack of reading There is as might be expected however a high correlation between the pupils who read widely and those who do superior work in composition and other phases of the course The attention of the class is also called to the fact that the number of pages read does not of itself indicate the time given to the course since he who reads chiefly among the works listed as imaginative literature will naturally have a larger total than he who reads widely among the study references and the works of history biography travel and essay In this connection it may be added that from threefourths to fourfifths of the reading of pupils is in the fields of imaginative literature and of history biography travel and essay Emphasis in short is laid upon the fact that the amount of reading which should be done is determined by the class as a whole that it sets the standard not the teacher that his demand will be met by the halfhour requirement These efforts to prevent wrong motivation seem to have been successful if one may judge by the frankness with which the pupils express themselves upon books and the enthusiasm with which they read worthy literature The experience of a ninthgrade girl is typical I read this book Jacob Riiss How the Other Half Lives to find out about the immigration problem Nothing too good can be said for it After I had read enough for school I read on and on Another Freshman a boy of mediocre ability summed up the matter in these words126 THE SCHOOL REVIEW Before this semester the only books I liked were cheap books that were utterly useless and gave no help to me at all During the year I read books and even though I disliked them I finished them Finally I could take up the dryest book and read in it without throwing it away as I had done before I read many books in relation to the topics and on the whole they were very interesting I am glad I have developed this taste The behavior of pupils during vacation when free from school control furnishes perhaps the best evidence whether the habits ideals and attitudes inculcated by the school have taken root Thus if a liking for worthy literature has been created or stimulated the taste should manifest itself in the kind of reading done in leisure hours In an effort to discover whether anything of this sort takes place in connection with the communitylife course the pupils in one section were asked to hand in cards listing any reading they had done during the recent holiday recess of one week Nothing had been said to them directly or indirectly about doing any reading during vacation the topic under consideration had been completed and a new book list had not yet been distributed The pupils were told that the cards asked for had nothing whatever to do with the work of the class that the reading done or not done would not affect their records and that the information was desired solely to satisfy the curiosity of the instructor Of the twentyfive pupils in the class all but one reported some reading Exclusive of periodical literature the amount varied from two hundred pages to twentyfive hundred The great bulk of the reading was in distinctly worthy literature Among the books reported were Dickens Oliver Twist Kiplings The Days Work Shakespeares Merchant of Venice Hugos Les Miserables and Goldsmiths The Vicar of Wakefield This result was not due solelyperhaps not even chieflyto the communitylife course Influences which function in the cultivation of taste are too numerous and too obscure to be identified easily The evidence seems to show however that the work in community life played a not inconsiderable part In Part III the phase of the course dealing with expression will be presented To be concluded

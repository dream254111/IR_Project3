VIRGINIA J SAMUEL MCCUE V COMMONWEALTH January 26 1905 1 PLEADINGDisqualification of grand jurorThe disqualification of a grand juror may be set up by plea in abatement and the issue so made up is one of fact to be submitted to the jury 2 PLEADINGReplicationConcluding with an offer to verifyConclud ing to the countryThe grave interests presented in this case cannot be determined upon the consideration of a fact so trivial as the conclud ing of a replication with an offer to verify when it should have been to the country 3 JURORsDisqualification of a member of the panelA person is not disqualified to act as a member of the panel for the trial of an accused because he states that he would go on the jury with his mind made up to the extent that it would require evidence to remove his opinion and change the view which he had already formed in regard to the case See bill of exceptions No 6 4 JURORSDisqualification of a member of the panelIt was not error to exclude from the panel against the objection of the petitioner a person who stated that he would not convict on circumstantial evi dence of an offense punishable with death unless the case against the accused were proved beyond the peradventure of a doubt The court does not comment upon this but see bill of exceptions No 7 5 JUROBSDisqualification of petit jurorA petit juror is Lot disquali fled to act who feels that he can go into the trial of the case leaving his mind open to the evidence free from any previously read accounts in the newspapers and go through the trial believing the accused to be innocent until he is proved guilty 6 EVIDENCECivil and criminal casesThe law of evidence is in general the same in civil and criminal cases In each case the object is the same to place evidence before the jury which will enable it to arrive at a just decision upon the issues 7 EVIDENCESec 3351 of CodeContradicting ones oun witnessCivil and criminal casesThe language of sec 3351 of the Code providing that a party may contradict his own witness in case the witness prove to be adverse is broad and general There is not a suggestion upon its face of the purpose to limit its operation to a particular class of cases and the mere collocation of this section should not override every other consideration and require the courts to confine it to civil cases when it is a remedy for an evil as great in criminal as in civil cases and the consequences of which may be even more serious Reported by George C Gregory1905 J SAMUEL ICUE V COMMONWEALTH 861 8 EVIDENCEContradicting ones own witness at common lawProof of contradictory statements of ones own witness voluntarily called and not a party was not generally admissible at common law 9 EVIDENcEExpert testimonyIt does not require the learning or ex perience of a practitioner of medicine to know that if a man were struck by a sand bag a blow sufficient to render him unconscious there would be at least some slight discoloration or external mark or after effect consequent upon the blow 10 EVIDENcEExpert testimonyWhere a witness is introduced as an expert to prove that a certain piece of cloth was a part of an under shirt worn by the accused at the time of the commission of the homi cide with which he is charged and it appears that the witness is a salesman of and dealer in underwear but has never manufactured it it is for the trial court to say whether or not his evidence should be admitted 11 PUnBIIC PROSECUToRRight to have attorneys to assist himThe right of a public prosecutor to have associated with him an attorney to assist in the prosecution is established law in this State and it is not a proper subject of animadversion 12 TRIALEffect of statement of attorney that he has refused a fee to prosecuteThere is no merit in an exception taken to a statement of an attorney who is assisting in the prosecution that he has refused a large fee to prosecute the accused though made in the presence of the jury if it is made in answer to criticism from the opposing counsel 13 ESToPPEIJurors reading newvspapersWhere the court in the pres ence of the prisoner and of his counsel at the instance of the jury grants them permission to have access to newspapers under rules which it prescribes and it does not appear that the limits imposed by the court were exceeded or that the prisoner was prejudiced by what occurred he will not be heard to make the objection after verdict 14 INSTRUCTIONsReasonable doubtAn instruction that by reasonable doubt is meant such doubt as would cause a man of average prudence to hesitate about a matter of his own of like importance to himself as the case on trial is to the accused is properly refused because there could be no case of importance to a man such as the case on trial was to the accused unless he himself stood upon his deliverance before a jury charged with a capital offence 15 INSTRUCTIONSPolicy of the lawAn instruction asked for that un der the humane policy of the law of this State it is considered infi nitely better that ninety and nine that is an indefinite number of guilty persons should escape punishment than that one innocent per so should be punished and therefore it is far better that the jury should err in acquittal than err in convicting is properly refused862 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb 16 APPEAL AND ERRORRight of appealDue process of lawA review by an appellate tribunal upon appeal or writ of error is no part of due process of law We have no such practice as an absolute right of appeal in civil or criminal cases Upon original and supplemental petitions for a writ of error to a judgment of the Corporation Court of the City of Charlottes ville rendered November 9th 1904 against J Samuel McCue the petitioner who was indicted tried convicted and sentenced to be hanged for the murder of his wife Fannie M McCue on the 4th day of September 1904 within the jurisdiction of the said city The petitioner excepted to numerous rulings of the court during the progress of the trial and tendered fortyfive bills of exception which were duly signed by the judge of the court Of these bills of exception the following are given from the original petition together with certain contentions of the petitioner Bill of Exceptions No 5The fifth exception was to the action of the court in accepting J Y Stockdell as a member of the panel for the trial of petitioners case Stockdells testimony is sufficiently stated in the opinion The petitioner here relies upon the decisions of DeJarnette v Commonwealth 75 Va 867 Armisteads Case 11 Leigh 663 TWrights Case 32 Gratt 941 and Coffin V United States 156 U S 432 Bill of Exceptions No 6The sixth exception was to the action of the court in accepting Jud B Wood as a member of the panel for the trial of petitioners case Petitioner By reference to the testimony of this witness given on his voir dire it will be seen that he had formed and expressed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of petitioner that his opinion was formed from reports published in the newspapers and that it was a decided one The following questions and answers taken from his testimony conclu sivelv denmonstrate that this juror was incompetent Q I understand then your opinion as formed is from reports publish ed in the newspapers A Yes sir Q Have these reports caused a very decided opinion A Well unfortunately I have read a little law and while I know that all that comnes in the newspapers is not proper yet I have formed a decided opinion on the subject which is on what I conceive to be the case I am not a lawyer but still I have read a little law Q And you say that is rather a decided opinion A Yes sir Well it is an opinion and it is a decided opinion on the evidence or what I conceive to be the evidence1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 863 Q Mr Wood if you went upon the jury now as I understand you you would go upon the jury with an opinion in your mind would you not A Yes sir Q Would it require evidence to remove that opinion from your mind and change the view which you have already formed in this case A I think it would Q It would require evidence A Yes sir Q Then to the extent you would go on the jury with your mind made up and to the extent it would require evidence to change that opinioii you would go upon the jury biased would you not to that extent  A Yes sir He was plainly incompetent nor was the error of the couIrt in accepting him cured by the jurors being stricken from the panel by petitioner under his riolgt of peremptory challenge In Dowdy V Commonwealth 9 Gratt 737 this court speaking by Mon eure J said He the disqualified juror appears not to have been one of the twelve jurors that tried the prisoner and must therefore have been one of the eight stricelen from the papel by the prisoner or one of those not selected by lot But this does not alter the case The prisoner may have stricken hiim from the panel because the challenge was overruled The case in this respect is somewhat like though stronger than Lithgows Case 2 Va Cas 297 in which it was held that if the court erroneously overrule a prisoners challenge to a juror for favor and then the prisoner peremptorily challenge the juror the error of the court is not cured by the subsequent exclusion of the juror although the prisoner had not exhausted his peremptory chal lenges even to the last Bill of Exceptions No 7The seventh exception was to the action of the couirt in excluding Frank K Tyler fromi the panel against the objection of petitioner The ground upon which this venireman was excluded by the court wvas that he would not convict on circumstantial evidence of an of fence puniishable with death unless the case against the accused were proved beyoild the peradventure of a doubt Heie the following decisions are relied upon Johnsons Case 29 Gratt 817  note to State v Hudson 97 Am St Rep 768 773 77 03 Common wealth v lVebster 52 Am Dec 711 Montague v Commonowealth 10 Gratt 767 Bill of Exceptions No 8The eighth exception was to the action of the court in permitting the witness M Kaufman to be asked whether or not in his opinion a small piece of cloth alleged to have been found by a cer tain W 0 Durrette in the bathroom of petitioners residence on the day following the alleged murder was a part of the undershirt alleged to have been worn by petitioner oni the night of the alleged murder and if so what part and in permitting the said Kaufman to answer the said ques tion which he did by saying in substance that in his judgment the said piece of clotlh belonged to the said shirt and NAas a piece of the same864 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb Petitioner Petitioner confidently submits that the question whether or not the piece of cloth corresponded in texture material thread etc with the shirt and whether it was a part or piece of the shirt and belonged to it were matters as to which opinionevidence was inadmissible Both the shirt and the piece of cloth were produced before the jury they were as well qualified as Kaufman to compare the two and say whether they corre sponded in texture material thread etc and whether or not the piece appeared to fit into any rent or missing place in the shirt and the Com monwealth had as much right to introduce the opinion of every citizen in Charlottesville for the purpose of influencing the verdiet of the jury in respect to this matter as it had to introduce Kaufman See Knowl v State 55 Wis 249 42 Am Rep 704 quoted from at length Milwaukee Ry Co V Kellogg 94 15 S 469 N  W Ry Co v Briggs Va 48 S E 521 and Insurance Co v Treat 29 Gratt 255 Bill of Exceptions No 11The eleventh exception was to the action of the court in permitting the Commonwealths witness Martin to testify to an alleged conversation between petitioner and his son Wm McCue in the jail In this conversation petitioner according to the witness said to his son that he the son knew that the statement made by Ernest Crawford about petitioners having drawn a pistol upon his wife was not true to which petitioners son according to the witness replied by affirming that petitioner did draw a pistol upon his wife Petitioner When the occurrence which was the subject of the alleged conversation between petitioner and his son transpired the evidence not only does not disclose but there is not the slightest suggestion or approx imation of the time Whether it was a week or a month or a year or five years or ten years before the homicide nowhere appears Petitioner submits that this consideration alone should have sufficed to exclude the evidence There must in every case of circumstantial evidence be some causal relation connection or proximity of time between the fact or circumstance adduced and the fact to be deduced therefromin other words between the principal fact to be established and the subsidiary facts relied upon to establish itand if the evidence fails to disclose some open and visible connectionto adopt the expression of Mr Justice Strongor causal relation or proximity of time the evidence should not be admitted The jury were expected to and doubtless did infer from the evidence in question thL petitioner murdered his wife on the 4th day of September 1904 or at least that his animus toward her was of a murderous nature While it may have been competent to show the animus of the accused to ward the deceased it is submitted that the evidence must have pointed and related to a reasonably recent time and evidence tending to stablish the animus was inadmissible unless at least some proximity of time appeared In other words remote occurrences are not admissible and the burden rested upon the Commonwealth to show that the occurrence or circumstance upon which it proposed to rely was not too remiote to justify the inference intended to be drawn from it1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 865 Bill of Exceptions No 15The fifteenth exception was to the action of the court in refusing to strike out so much of the testimony of Dr Nelson a witness introduced by the Commonwealth as related to his opinion in regard to the effect or results of a blow struck with a sand bag or other similar instrument Petitioner The Commonwealth proved by certain witnesses that peti tioner had stated on the night of the homicide and afterwards that he had been attacked on the night of the homicide by an unknown intruder into his chamber and had received at the hands of the intruder two blows one in the region of his eye or temple and the other on the back of his headby which blows or one of them petitioner had been rendered un conscious for some space of time No external mark appearing on the back of petitioners head according to the testimony of certain witnesses for the Commonwealth the prosecution felt called upon to undertake to establish that if there had been a blow with a sand bag or other soft instrument on the back of the head sufficient to produce unconsciousness there would have been some sort of external mark For this purpose the witness Dr Nelson was inttroduced by the Commonwealth and allowed to state to the jury that in his opinion if a man was struck with a sand bag a blow sufficient to render him unconscious there would be some slight discoloration or some sort of external mark or some after effect such as sickness or vomit ing But it was developed in the course of the further examination of the witness that he had never seeni a blow with a sand bag that he had never had any experience in respect to injuries or blows with a sandbag or any other soft instrument of that character that he had never had any oppor tunity of observing or making an examination of any person struck with a sand bag or any weapon like a sand bag that he had never read anything on the subject that he did not regard himself by any means an expert in the matter of blows struck by sand bags or weapons of  that character Whereupon petitioner moved the court to strike out and instruct the jury to disregard this testimony Bills of Exceptions Nos 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 32 and 33The sixteenth seventeenth eighteenth nineteenth twen tieth twentyfirst twentysecond twentythird tventyf uurth twentyfifth twentysixth twenyseventh twentyeighth twentyninth thirtysecond and thirtythird exceptions all relate to the impeachment by the Common wealth of the witness Wim McCue petitioners son introduced by the Commonwealth Petitioner By reference to the bills of exception numbered as above it will be seen that the prosecution having introduced the witness in ques tion claimed to be taken by surprise by his testimony although the attor neys for the Commonwealth admitted that they had never interviewed him By reference to the testimony of this witness beginning on page 657 it will be observed that the alleged surprise did not come until after the wit ness had given about six typewritten pages of testimony At this point Rec p 663 Capt Micajah Woods the attorney conducting the examina tion of the witness on behalf of the Commonwealth stated to the court866 10 VIRGtNIA LAW REGISTER Feb that he had never interviewed the witness that the witness had made a statemient that was entirely different from what he had expected and had entirely surprised the attorney in this matter because he Was advised by reputable people that At this point Capt Woods was interrupted by counsel for petitioner and objection was made to his completing the statement he was about to make petitioners counsel stating that if the prosecuting attorney was taken by surprise he was entitled to avail himself of the law regulating that The prosecuting attorney thereupon proceeded to ask the witness if he had not made certain statements The examination of the witness which the Commonwealth was permitted to pursue along this line took an exceedingly wide range and involves several important considerations which petitioner desires to bring sharply to the attention of this honorable court After having asked these ques tions the Commonwealth was then permitted to contradict the witness not only as to statements which he denied having made but as to mere opinions which he denied having expressedby showing not that the state ments alleged to have been made by the witness were untrue but by prov ing by other witnesses that the witness Wm McCue himself had made the statements which he denied having made and had expressed the opin ions which he denied having expressed Indeed the socalled impeachment did not stop here but under its guise the prosecution was permitted to prove every act in the whole conduct of the witness which seems to have been under the espionage of detectives all the while that the prosecution saw fit to show and which might be distorted not into evidence of peti tioners guilt but into behavior Qr bearing on the part of the witness indicative of a belief on his part at some prior time that petitioner was guilty By reference to Bill of Exceptions No 16 it will be seen that the witness Wim McCue was asked by the prosecuting attorney whether or not he witness remembered going to Links drug store on Tuesday after the deceased was buried and seeing one Julian Paoli there and whether the witness remnembered a certain conversation betwveen Paoli and himselfto which the witness replied in the negative Petitioners counsel objected to this line of examination as improper and illegal wlheireupon the prosecu tion stated that they were crosaexamining the witness as an adverse wit iness claiming to have shown that his testimony was different from what the Commonwealth thought it would be Petitioners counsel inquired how this appearedto which the prosecution replied that it appeared from the evidence of the witness given on the day before The court then offered to r ule upon the question whether or not the witness was adverse but the prosecuting attorney deemed it unnecessarv because as he claimed in the presence of the jury that when he examined the witness as to what hap pened at the time of and after the tragedy he Woods was astonished and astounded to find his statement so utterly different fromii what Here the counsel was again interrupted by petitioners counsel ro tbis statement of Woods petitioners counsel then and there excepted19053 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 867 upon the ground that a witness could not be impeached in the presence of the jury by a statement of counsel The colloquy between petitioners coun sel and the counsel for the prosecution at this point is set out in Bill of Exceptions No 16 It will be noted that the prosecuting attorney was permitted to state and did state in the presence of the jury that the testimony of the witness was entirely different from what he expected that he was astonished and astounded at it and if he had thought or had talk ed with the witness and found out he witness was going to give the testimony which he did give he Woods would not have put him on the stand and that he brought him there expecting him to give an entirely different statement of facts To these remarks statements and asseverations petitioners counsel then and there excepted The question therefore distinctly raised by the six teenth exception is whether or not counsel may thus exploit his surprise or astonishmentbe it genuine or feignedvehemently charge that the witness statement is contrary to what the counsel had been informed by reputable people it would be and in effect denounce the witness as a turncoat and a liar in the presence of the jury It is confidently submitted that this ought not to be allowed in any court It was peculiarly improper in this case in which public opinion and prejudice ran almost to riot against petitioner as shown by the fact that it was deemed useless to even attempt to procure a local jury for his trial and by the further fact as shown by the record that there were diur ing the progress of the trial actual demonstrations in the courtroom unfavorable to petitioner See 2 Encyc P  Practice p 738 and cases cited The ground upon which all of the evidence in question was admitted by the trial court was that section 3351 of the Code as amended by the Act of January 24th 1900 made such evidence proper Petitioner confidently submits 1 That section 3351 as amended has no application to criminal prose cutions 2 That if the section in question did apply to criminal prosecutions no warrant is to be found therein for the length to which the Common wealth was permitted to go in this case 3 That independently of the statute the evidence in question was wiholly inadmissible and improper Does Section 3351 Apply to Criminal Prosecutions The genesis of section 3351 was an act passed by the General Assembly of the Restored Government of Virginia on the 29th day of January 1864 to be found at page 17 of the Acts of the General Assemnbly for the year 1864 published at Alexandria the second section of which act was as follows Any party to any civil action or proceeding whether at law or in equity may compel any adverse party or any person for whose immediate and adverse benefit such action or proceeding is instituted prosecuted or de fended to testify as a witness in his behalf in the same manner and subject868 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb to the same rules as other witnesses Provided that the party so called to testify may be examined by the opposite party under the rules applicable to the crossexamination of witnesses This act remained in force until March 2 1866 whun the General Assem bly passed an act entitled An Act to repeal an act entitled an act relating to Witnesses passed by the General Assembly of the Restored Government of Virginia on the 29th day of January 1864 Acts 18656 page 87 This act provided that no witness should be incmpetent to testify because of interest but should be competent to give evidence on his own behalf in all actions suits and other proceedings of a civil nature at law or in equity but that in all cases both at law and in equity the evidence of parties should be given ore tenus and not by depositionsprovided how ever that the act should not be construed to alter the rules of law then in force in respect to the competency of husband and wife as witnesses for and against each other It was further provided that if a party required by another to testify in his behalf should refuse to do so it should be lawful for the court to dismiss the suit or other proceeding of the party so refus ing in whole or in part and then followed the identical language of see 3351 as it stood before the act of January 24th 1900 and just as it was embodied in the Code of 1887 A party called to testify for another having an adverse interest may be examined by such other party according to the rules applicable to crossexami nation It is perfectly patent that neither of these acts applied to criminal prose cutions and so at the revisal of 1887 we find both the provisions of the Act of March 2 1866 embodied in TiT 48 of the Code relating to PRO CEEDINGS IN CIVIL CASES and not in TITE 53 relating to PROCEEDINGS IN CRIMINAL CASES nor in TITLE 52 relating to CRIMES AND PUNISH MENTS By reference to page 765 of the Code of 1887 just in front of chapter 156 will be found the table of contents of TITLE 48PROCEEDINGS IN CIVIL CASES Title 48 embraces chapters 156 to 171 both inclusive and we find the provisions of the Act of March 2 1866 embodied in chapter 164 of the Code in sees 3345 to 3351 both inclusive These sections coIn tain the provision that no person shall be incompetent to testify because of interest the qualification of this provision with reference to husband and wife the provision for the dismissal of the action suit or other proceeding of a party refusing to testify when required by his adversary and the provision that when a party is called to testify for another having an ad verse interest he may be examined by his adversary according to the rules applicable to crossexamination If we turn to Title 52 embracing chapters 189 to 190 both inclusive and to chapter 190 containing General Provisions Concerning Crimes and Punishments we find the provision allowing an accused person in any case of felony or misdemeanor to testify in his own behalf but subject to erossexamination as any other witness the provision that his failure to testify shall create no presumption against him nor be the subject of any1905 J SAMUET MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 869 comment before the court or jury by the prosecuting attorney sec 3897 the provision that no person who is not jointly tried with the defendant shall be incompetent to testify in any prosecution by reason of interest in the subjectmatter thereof see 3900 the provision that in a criminal prosecutionexcept for perjuryor in an action on a penal statute evi dence shall not be given against the accused of any statement made by him as a witness upon a legal examination unless he was examined as a wit ness in his own behalf Sec 3901 We also find in this same chapter other provisions with reference to evi dence in criminal cases namely the provision that a person convicted of a felony shall be disqualified as a witness unless he has been pardoned or punished therefor that a person convicted of perjury shall not be a witness although pardoned or punished that no person prosecuted for unlawful gaming shall be competent to testify against any witness for the Common wealth in such prosecution touching any unlawful gaming committed by him prior to such prosecution It will thus be seen that the corresponding provisions in reference to civil and criminal cases are not found in the same chapter or under the same title but in different chapters and under distinct titles while if we turn to chapter 198 embraced in TITLE 53PROCEEDINGS IN CRIMINAL CASEswe find it provided in sec 4059 that secs 3475 3476 3483 3492 and 3507all of which except the last are embraced in TITLE 48PRo CEEDINGS IN CIVIL CASESshall apply as well to criminal as to civil casesthus showing in the most unmistakable way that except when it is expressly so provided the provisions with reference to Proceedings in Civil Cases were not intended to apply to criminal cases See also sec 4080 where it is expressly provided that secs 3549 3550 and 3551 shall apply to a person attending as a witness in a criminal case as well as to a person attending as a witness in a civil case It is manifest then both from the history of sec 3351 and from its arrangement classification or collocation in the Code that it was never intended or considered to be applicable to criminal cases Indeed the necessary import of its very language restricts it to civil cases A party called to testify for anotherthe Commonwealth has no right of course to call an accused person to testify on her behalf and against himself while equally of course that entity known as The Commonwealth is incapable of being a witness The legislature having amended sec 3351 without expressly applying its provisions to criminal cases it cannot be assumed that it meant to extend the operation of the section amended to cases to which it did not apply before If the legislature meant to change the law in respect to criminal cases it woould hardly have sought to do so by amending a statute appli cable in the nature of things to civil cases only without indicating a purpose to extend it to criminal cases Andersons Case 100 Va 860 is in point See 3385 of the Code in reference to bills of exception Title 48 was amended February 15 1901 so as to allow bills of exception to be signed within thirty days after the end of the term The amendment did870 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb not as a subsquent amendment does apply in terms to criminal cases Anderson was tried and convicted at the December term 1901 of the County Court of Campbell He applied to the judge of the Circuit Court for a writ of error which was granted but the Circuit Court at the sub sequent hearing dismissed the writ of error upon the ground that the bills of exception taken to the rulings of the County Court were not tendered to and signed by the judge of said court until after the adjournment of the December term at which Anderson was tried The statute with refer ence to bills of exception in criminal cases contained in sec 4050 of the Code Title 53 had not been amended but only see 3385 Title 48 That sec 3385 did not apply to criminal cases was a conce8s8um in the Circuit Court It was also a concessum in this court for the judgment of the Circuit Court dismissing the writ of error was reversed by this court not upon the ground that sec 3385 appliedwhich would have been an end of the matterbut upon the ground that this court must presume from the record that the bills were signed during the term Petitioner confidently submits therefore that the statute under the supposed authority of which the learned judge of the trial court admitted the evidence in question does not apply to criminal cases It will be more logical before discussing whether or not the Common wealth was permitted to exceed the limits contemplated by the statute supposing it to apply to criminal casesto inquire what the law is in respect to the crossexamination and impeachment of ones own witnesses independently of statute Could the Commonwealth Independently of Statute CrossExatmine and Impeach a Wtitness Introduced by Her After a careful investigation of the authorities by his counsel petitioner is constrained to concede that where a party is taken by surprise by the unexpected and unfavorable testimony of a witness introduced by him such party may for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of the wit ness and inducing him to correct his testimony or explain its inconsistency ask him if he did not on another specified occasion make a statement in consistent with his present statementprovided the statement be otherwise admissible But petitioner insists on the other hand that if the witness on being asked whether or not he previously made a statement contradic tory of the one made on the stand denies having done so the party pro ducing him may not introduce other witnesses to prove such contradictory statement of the witness On this point petitioner shall pursue the same policy which he has pur sued throughout this petition namely that of citing a few well considered cases decided by appellate courts of the highest respectability and decisive of the very question in hand In the first place then petitioner is unable to find that this question has ever been raised or decided in Virginia But the very fact that a statute has been passed permitting a party to prove contradictory statements of his own witness in civil cases shows that but for the statute the thing1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTh 871 could not be done while the following cases decided by the appellate courts of other states would seem to be conclusive Coa v Eayres 55 Vermont 24 45 Amer Rep 583 In this case the sole question was whether a party might show that his own witness had made statements out of court contradictory of his testi mony in court and the syllabus of the case as reported in the American Reports contains but a single point as follows A party may not show that his own witness had made statements con tradictory of his testimony Ain examination of the case will show that a number of textbooks and decisions both in this country and England were critically examined by the court with the result that it reached the unanimous conclusion stated in the syllabus Among the textwriters referred to are Buller Best Wharton Greenleaf and Redfield and besides numerous English cases the following American cases are cited in support of the conclusion reached by the court namely Ellicott V Pearl 10 Peters 432 Supreme Court of U S Bullacrd v Pearsall 53 N Y 230 Coulter V Express Co 56 N Y 585 Pollock v Pollock 71 N Y 137 Adams v Wheeler 97 Mass 67 The view expressed by the Supreme Court of Vermont was that the plain tiff in that case was properly allowed to ask the witness himself concerning previous statements but that it was error to allow the plaintiff to show by other witnesses prior contradictory statements made by the witness Such evidence says the court has no other effect than to discredit the witness and to show him to be unworthy of belief and we prefer to adhere to what we deem to be the well settled rule of the common law on this subject and leave it to the legislature to determine whether a diffrent rule shall prevail rather than follow the lead of those who would disregard the rule as not founded in reason Judge Redfield is cited by the court in its opinion as holding that the party should be allowed to inquire of the witness as to his prior contradic tory statements and this for the purpose of showing the witness that he is in error and getting him to correct himself but that it would be going too far to allow a party to show that the testimony of his witness is con tradictory of statements made by him out of court on the examination of the witness preparatorv to the trial In Hu4rley v State of Ohio 46 Ohio State Rep 320 4 L R A 161 the question was laboriously examined by the Supreme Court of Ohio whose conclusion is embodied in the following headnotes by the court 1 A party who calls a witness and is taken by surprise by his unex pected and unfavorable testimnony may interrogate him in respect to declarations and statements previously made by him which are inconsistent with his testimony for the purpose of refreshing his recollection and in ducing him to correct his testimony or explain his apparent inconsistency872 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb and for such purpose his previous declarations may be repeated to him and he may be called upon to say whether they were made by him 2 In case the witness denies having made such statements or his answer is ambiguous concerning theln it is not competent for the party calling him to prove them by other witnesses From the opinion of the court by Williams J we make the following quotation And in Ryerson v Abington 102 Mass 526 Gray J after quoting the statute proceeds as follows So great a change in the rules of evidence giving so extensive a power to a party to introduce proof in contradiction and disparagement of a witness put on the stand by himself uncontrolled by the discretion of the judge before whom the trial is had must be kept strictly within the bounds of the statute And again Statuites similar in their provisions to the English Common Law Pro cedure Act have been adopted by Massachusetts Kentucky Georgia and some of the other States The enactment of such statutes is itself a recog nition of the necessity of a resort to legislation to accomplish a change in the rule thereby affected and has been so regarded by the courts of the States where they have been adopted And still againin answering the argument that a party might be sacri ficed by the contrivances of an artful witnessthe court said This is but an argument in favor of a partys right to impeach his own witness for it must be considered that no other legitimate effect could be claimed from the proof of the contradictory statements than that of neutralizing hostile testimony by casting discredit on the witness Yet while this is its only legitimate effect the danger of sacrificing one party by admitting it is not less than that of sacrificing another by excluding it It is not difficult to understand that the evil consequences to be apprehend ed from permitting the former statements of the witness in contradiction of his testimony on the trial to be proven by the partv calling him may be quite as serious and the apprehension as well grounded as any likely to re sult from adhering to the rule as now established A person might from mo tives of spite or revenge make statements against the accused in a criminal case which if true would be sufficient to convict for the purpose of having them communicated to the prosecutor and thus procuring himself to be called as a witness and even if when put upon his oath at the trial he testifies truly that he knows nothing about the case and the prosecuting attorney were then allowed to prove a former statement of the witness the jury might give them such weight as would turn the scale in a doubtful case and the revenge of the witness would be gratified Then a party might operate upon a witness by inducing him to make statements in his favor when not under oath for the purpose of manufac turing evidence in his behalf and if when examined by him the witness should feel the obligation of his oath and abandon his purpose to testify falsely or be obliged to do so under crossexamination the party who operated upoIn him would be prepared to destroy his credibility by proofs1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 873 of the false statements he procured him to make and thus not only prevent his being injurious when he could not or would not be useful but have whatever advantage such statements might give him to the jury The rule that a party cannot discredit his own witness by proving that he had made statements at other times inconsistent with his testimony on the trial is the result of long experience and has been steadily adhered to by the courts of this country and England That the rule has generally operated favorably in judicial investigations can hardly be questioned If it be said it has not had that effect in every instance as much might be said of many well established rules of law and the general good result is to be regarded rather than the particular inconvenience and it might well be doubted whether it is not a sounder rule than that adopted by some statutes which leave it within the unregulated discretion of each judge to admit such and only such testimony as may seem to him expedient Petitioner humbly submits that the views so well expressed in the opin ion just quoted should commend themselves to the court in the case now before it The evidence shows that petitioners young and inexperienced boy found himself soon after the tragedy not only in the vortex of a public sentiment extremely adverse to petitioner but also under the espionage and surveillance of professional detectives who undertook to make him a witness against his father Trhat the boy may not have been able at first to stem the torrent and withstand the influences and blandishments brought to bear upon himn can be well imagined That he may have been brought to be lieve for a moment in the guilt of his father and even to have lent himself for a while to his fathers accusers is in view of the circumstances neither incredible nor altogether unnatural Neither is it unbelievable as suggest ed by the learned judge in the opinion just quoted that some one might have operated upon the witness to induce him to make statements out of court for the very purpose of manufacturing evidence in behalf of the Com monwealth believing that even if the witness when put to the test of an oath should abandon the statements he had been induced to make they might nevertheless be gotten before the jury and the court under the pre text of impeaching the witness Even if the statute were applicable to crimininal prosecutions no warrant could be found therein for the length to which the Commonwealth was permitted to go in this case in the impeachment of the witness Wil liam McCue But petitioner confidently submits that independently of the question whether the statute applies to criminal cases and of the question whether a party could but for the statute impeach his own witness by proving contradictory statements made by him out of court the Commonwealth was permitted in petitioners case to go far beyond the limits contemplated by the statute or otherwise legitimate The statute provides that a party producing a witness may in case the witness shall in the opinion of the court prove adverse contradict him by other evidence or by leave of the court prove that he has made at other874 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb times a statement inconsistent with his present testimony As already pointed out the witness had given many typewritten pages of testimony before the representatives of the Commonwealth sought to impeachl him or to lay the foundation for his impeachment By reference to the testimony it will be seen that the only question as to which the witness had proved adverse tup to the time when the represen tatives of the Commonwealth sought to lay the foundation for contradicting him was when he answered the question as to what took place between his father and mother at the supper table on the evening of the homicide The representatives of the Commonwealth claimed that when the witness testi fied that there was no disagreement or unpleasantness between his father and mother at the supper table they expected an entirely different answser from him If as the representatives of the Commiionwealth claimed they were surprisled astonished or astounded at the answer of the witness as to what transpired at the supper table they certainly had no right to be surprised that the witness should have answered unfavorably any other question propounded to him on behalf of the Commonwealth The ground upon which the right of a party to prove that his witness has made a state ment inconsistent with his testimony rests is that the party producing hinm is taken by surprise and may be prejudiced by the testimony of a witness whom he has held out as credible It is perfectly clear that if the party producing a witness knows or has reason to believe that his testimony will be adverse or unfavorable he cannot contradict him This for obvious reasons So then in this case while the Commonwealth would have the right supposing the statute to apply to prove a contradictory statement made by the witness as to what transpired at the supper tablehis answer being entirely different from what she had a right to expectshe wouldt have no right to contradict the witness in respect to any other subsequent question asked by the Commonwealth and eliciting an unfavorable answer for the reason that it had become appazrent fromb the antswer already given that the witness was an adverse witness Certainly after having received an unfavorable answer from the witness in respect to the occurrences at the supper table when they had the right to expect and did expect a favorable one the representatives of the Commonwealth were put upon fair notice that the witness was adverse and not to expect favorable testimony from him Possibly to make perfectly sure that the witness was adverse alld was going to give testimony entirely differenit froin wvhat the representa  tives of the Commonwealth had been led to expect they should liave been permitted to go one step further and ask the witness onte more qutestion calculated to develop his attitude toward the prosecution but to hold that after being fully satisfied that the witness was uncomipromisingly adverse thei Commonwealth might nevertheless proceed to ask the witness a score of questions kiiowinq that the answers would be unfavorable and might then contradict the witness by showing by other witnesses that he had inale inconsistent statements and what the inconsistent statements were was carrying the loctrine of impeaching ones own witness to an extent far beyond what any adjudged case can be found to have alllowed far beyoild1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWI3ALTH 875 the scope of the statute fairly construed and far beyond what justice to petitioner whose life was at stake could have countenanced Common fairness and good faith on the part of the Commonwealth required when she became satisfied that the witness was adverse that he should have been told to stand aside and the impeachment of bim confined to the answers made by him up to that time In the colloquy between counsel relative to this matter and set out in Bill of Exceptions No 16 one of the prosecuting attorneys stated in effect that if he had talked with the witness and found him to be adverse he would not have put him upon the stand This statement of the attorney em bodies the true rule which should have governed his action but such was not the case Knowing that the witness was adverse he continued to ply him with question after question and elicit answer after answer that he knew full well would be unfavorable and then under the pretext of im peaching the witness got before the jury matter utterly damaging to peti tionerthus relying upon an atmosphere created by statements and opin ions put intcr the mouth of the witness by others but which he repudiated to convict petitioner Petitioner is not sure that he has made the point clear and will en deavor to restate it in another form The object of allowing a party to prove that a witness produced by him has made at other tines a statement inconsistent with his present testimony is to guard against damage to the case of the party who has been deceived by an unscrupulous witness into putting him upon the stand by neutralizing the hostile testimony and the party so deceived has if the case be covered by the statute a rigrht to such impeachment commensurate with the testimony which he has been deceived into producing against himselfto the extent of the ullookedfor answer of the witness upon whom he has in good faith relied The party must have been in good faith surprised and when he has set himself right and by discrediting the witness to the extent that he has unwittingly made him his own eliminated the unlookedf or and unexpected testimony the right of the surprised party in the respect we are considering is and ought to be exhausted If he were not deceivedif he knew or had rea son to believe in the beginning that the witness would be adverseit will not be contended that the right to discredit his witness in the manner pre scribed by the statute would be available The samie principle which would prevent a party from knowingly introduicing an adverse witness should prevent the party froml continuing to interrogate except so far as mliay be necessary in order to cover the unlooked for answer a witness after his hostility has been disclosed He has no riglht knowingly to continue to elicit adverse testimonv and thereby entitle himself to prove matters other wise inadmiiissiblie in evidence Again Petitioner has already cited the opinion of Gray J in Ryerson V Abington 102 Mass 526 in which speaking of the Massachusetts sta tute he said that so great a change in the rules of evidence giving so ex tensive a power to a party to introduce proof in contradiction and dispar agenent of a witness puit on the stand by himself must be kept strictly876 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb within the bounds of the statute When we come to consider the language of the statute it would seem plain that it never was meant or intended that the party producing a witness might under any circumstances prove the contradictory statements themselves but only the fact that the witness has made a statement inconsistent with his present testimony The statute in terms permits the party to prove the fact that his witness had made an inconsistent statement but it does not permit the party to prove what the statement was This construction of the statute is made plain by the following provision for laying the foundation for such proof Before proof can be given that the witness has made an inconsistent statement the circumstances of the supposed statement sufficient to designate the particu lar occasion must be mentioned to the witness The statute does not say that the supposed statement itself may be mentioned to the witness but only the circumstances thereof sufficient to designate the occasion It would seem therefore that the legislature was very careful not to provide that any statement of a witness made out of court might be detailed in totidem verbis to the jury but only that after asking the adverse witness whether or not he made on a designated occasion a statement inconsistent with his present testimony other witnesses may be introduced if he deny having made an inconsistent statement to testifynot to the prior state ment in totidem verbis of the witnessbut to the fact that he did make a statement inconsistent with his present testimony It is submitted that this is a fair and reasonable interpretation of the statute that so construed the statute would accomplish all that it was intended to accomplish and the possibility of the real issue in a case being obscured by collateral ones and turning and being decided upon evidence improper to be considered be reduced to a minimum By this construction the extensive power to introduce proof in contradiction and disparagement of ones own witness should would be kept strictly within the bounds of the statute while the object of the statute would be just as effectively accom plished Petitioners case is a concrete example of the great abuse to which a loose construction of the statute leadsan instance in which the life of a citizen is adjudged forfeited not upon evidence of his guilt but upon al leged statements opinions and conduct out of court of a witness intro ulced not by the accused but by the Commonwealth Under the construc tion of the statute by the trial judge it is easy to conceive that in any doubtful casewhere upon every principle of our jurisprudence the ac cused should go acquitthe scale may be turned by the sheer weight or force of testimony theoretically indeed relevant to an entirely collateral issue only but which no one should be so uncandid as to deny is in fact decisive of the main issue Finally petitioner confidently submits that independently of each and all of the foregoing considerations a large and material part of the testi mony introduced ostensibly for the purpose of impeaching the witness Wm McCue was wholly inadmissible in any view of the case for the reason that it was addressed to matters wholly irrelevant to the issue and1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 877 in respect to which the Commonwealth had no right to introduce impeach ing evidence One of the elementary rules of evidence is that when a witness is cross examined on a matter collateral to the issue he cannot as to his answer be subsequently contradicted by the party putting the question This is a settled rule of practice the object of which is to avoid interminable multi plication of issues and says a learned author whose exposition of the principle now under consideration has been literally adopted by this court The test whether the fact inquired of is collateral is this would the cross examining party be entitled to prove it as a part of his case tending to es tablish his plea See Langhorne v Commonwealthv 76 Va 1019 in which the foregoing quotation from Wharton on Evidence is adopted by this court speaking by Judge Anderson Another elementary rule of evidence is that prior contradictory state ments of a witness in order to be admissible to impeach him must be statements of fact and not mere opinions of the witness This doctrine is thus stated in 10 Encyc Pleading  Practice page 298 In order that a witness may be impeached upon his statement such statement must be not only relevant to the issue but must also be of a matter of fact and not merely a former opinion of the witness in regaird to the matter at issue which is inconsistent with the conclusion which the facts testified to by him would tend to establish unless indeed the matter in question be one upon which the opinion of the witness is admissible in evidence in which case his opinion is material to the nmatter at issue and he may be contradicted by proof of a contrary opinion expressed by him out of court Petitioners italics And in a note to the paragraph quoted it is stated on the authority of Hubbell V Bissell 2 Allen Mass 196 If a witness who is not called as an expert has testified to facts tending to show that a party to a contract was at the time of making it incom petent to contract by reason of mental imbecility and his owD opinion is not asked for or given in evidence it is not competent to show by uway of contradiction of his testimony acts done by him indicating that he consid ered the party of sound mind Petitioners italics In Schell v Plumb 55 N Y 599 the court said A party has the right for the purpose of discrediting the testimony of an adverse witness to prove statements made by him contradicting the testimony given after the requisite examination of the witness in regard to such statement No question as to this was made upon the trial An opin ion expressed by a witness upon the merits is inadmissible though in con flict with his testimony Citing Holmes v Anderson 18 Barb 420 Petitioners italics In Elton v Larkins 5 C  P 385 24 E C L 617 decided by Lord Chief Justice Tindal it was held A witness cannot be called to contradict another who denies having made a particular statement if such statement was not of a fact but only of a matter of opinion as such statement of opinion does not come within878 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb the rule which confines contradictions to matters directly connected with the issue in the cause Petitioners italics In Wel8h V State Ind 3 N E Rep 850 a witness Cooper having testified on his direct examination that he heard no confession made by the defendant to James another witness and no talk between them about the murder was asked on crossexamination by counsel for the State if he did not say in a certain barber shop there that morning that he knew Welsh was the man that killed Fedderto which question the accused objected for the reason that it was asking the witness for an opinion expressed by him and not for a factwhich objection being overruled the witness an swered denying the statement imputed to him The State then asked the witness if he did not say there on the occasion referred to in the pre ceding question that he was willing to bet 250 that Welsh was the guilty manto which question the accused objected and his objection being over ruled the witness answered in the negative The State then called Profit the proprietor of the barber shop and asked him to state to the jury whether he heard Cooper make the remark that Welsh was the man who murdered Fedder and whether Cooper at the same time said he was will ing to bet 250 that Welsh was the manto each of which questions the accused objected and the objection being overruled Profit answered both questions in the affirmative The latter question was also asked Innes an other witness introduced by the State with like result The Appellate Court dealing with the exceptions to these rulings said We know of no principle or authority upon which to maintain the rul ings of the court in admitting the testimony of Profit and Innes The con versation about which inquiry was made of Cooper on crossexamination was so remotely if at all connected with the subject of his direct examinia tion and of the matter at issue that the rule was put to its utmost tension in allowing the question to be asked him over the defendants objection As however if the witness had admitted that he made the declarations imputed to him by the crossexamining question such admission might have formed the basis for further inquiry as to the sources of his knowledge or the grounds upon which he based his opinion of the guilt of the accused with the view of driving him ultimately to an admission that he had heard the alleged confession we think it was within the discretion of the court to allow the question Having denied the imputed declarations we think the State was bound by the denial The subject aboiut which the witness was inquired of was new and collateral to the main issue Citing 97 Ind 430 It did not comne within the rule that a witness may he shown to have madie statements out of court inconsistent with his testimony given upon the trial The conversation or declarations imputed to him had no rela tion except by argument or inference to the testimony given by the witness in his examinationinchief They were not contradictory of his testimony as given nor were they inconsistent with it so as to become the subject of an impeachment Citing Wharton on Evidence ses 558 559 This case is complete in its analogy with that of People v Stackhouse 49 Mich 76 13 N WV Rep 364 In that case a witness was examined or1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 879 behalf of the accused who was on trial for the crime of arson On cross examination she was asked if she had not said to certain persons named on the night the accused was arrested that she always did suspect that he did burn the mill Having denied the imputed conversation two witnesses were called who testified that she had so stated Reversing this ruling the court said The opinion or suspicions of the witness out of court although inconsistent with the conclusion which the facts which she testified to on the trial would warrant cannot be made the basis of an impeachment This is so firmly settled by the authorities that the question cannot be consid ered an open one Whether the matter inquired of on crossexamination and proved by the State in the impeachment of Cooper was collateral to the main inquiry or not is determined by this inquiry Would the prosecuting attorney have been permitted to introduce it in evidence as a part of the States case If he would not it was collateral If it was collateral it was not compe tent to contradict it The learned judge then proceeds to cite and quote from numerous author ities with the result that the following unanimoU8 conclusion was reached The ruling of the court in admitting this evidence and other rulings admitting the evidence of like character was such error as must reverse the judgment Bill of Exceptions No 35The thirtylifth exception was to the action of the court in permitting the witness John Perry introduced by the court at the instance of a member of the jury to be asked certain questions Petitioner This witness not having been introduced by the Common wealth and the questions propounded to him with reference to statements alleged to have been made by him to the witnes8 W G Baldwin when tested by the rule laid down by this court in Langhorne v Commonwealth being as petitioner advised probably admissible petitioner refrains fronm discussion of them It will be noted that in each instance the statement to Baldwin which the witness was asked whether or not he had made was of a matter which the Commonwealth had the right to prove as a part of her casefor instance the occurrences at the house at the time of the alleged mnurder and the alleged statements of petitioner to the witness on that occasion etc So also in respect to the questions propounded to this witness concerlming alleged statements made by him to Susan Austin and Carrie Perry But petitioner insists that it was error to permnit the Commonwealth to ask the witness concerning alleged conversations between him and the wit ness Wm McCue the next morning after the interview at the wine cellar and whether or not Wm McCue wrote down what he John Perry said on that occasionthese being collateral matters But especially did the Com iionwealth not hatve the right to contradict the witness by his alleged statement to the witness Wm McCue and which it was claimed the latter afterwards wrote out This phase of the matter is presented by Bill of Exceptions No 40 whicl880 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb will now be consideredthe intervening exceptions between this and the last being immaterial Btll of Exceptions No 40Petitioner From the Bill of Exceptions No 40 it appears that after the occurrences set forth in the foregoing bills of exception Capt Woods one of the prosecuting attorneys said to the court and jury that Wm McCue the son having admitted that he wrote this statement made to him by John Perry he the attorney would now read it to the juryto the introduction of which paper petitioner excepted It will be noted 1 That the witness Wm McCue testified that he did not write down the statement in question at the time that John Perry made it or in the presence of John Perry but that he afterwards went to the house and wrote the paper 2 That when he read it to John Perry the latter then and there re pudiated it and said that they the Baldwins had tried to get him to make that statement but that it was untrue 3 That the witness John Perry denied ever having made the state ment embodied in the paperwriting in question to the witness Wm Mc Cue at all This is all the evidence touching the paper in question except that Bald win said that Wm McCue said that Perry said the statement therein con tained was true Upon what principle then petitioner begs to know was the paper admitted and read to the jury John Perry denied that he ever made the statement The question whether John Perry had made the state ment was asked Wm McCue for the purpose of layitng a foundation to im peach him WWm McCue by Baldwin Wm McCue testified as already pointed out that the statement was not only not written down in the presence of or signed by John Perry but that when he Wm McCue read it to John Perry he denied that it contained the truth So then we have a paper containing matter most inculpatory of petitioner written out by one witness impeached by the Commonwealth as the statement of an other witness impeached by the Commonwealth and repudiated and denied by both That the statement so far as petitioner was concerned was the veriest hearsay cannot be gainsaid The trial court admitted the paper for the purpose of discrediting the witness John Perry That is to say permitted this witness whose state ment on the stand was most favorable to petitioner to be impeached by a paper he did not write which was not written in his presence and which by the uncontroverted evidence he promptly repudiated and refused to sign when shown to him The statement of the proposition is sufficient comment would be superfluous Bill of Exceptions No 44The fortyfourth exception relates to a state ment made by Capt Micajah Woods in the presence of the jury after the closing argument on behalf of petitioner had been concluded in which state ment Capt Woods said that he had refused a large fee to prosecute petitioner It appears that Capt Woods in the course of his opening argament before1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 881 the jury stated that petitioner had been his friend for twenty years in reply ing to which counsel for petitioner had animadverted upon this utterance by Capt Woods It was in answer to this animadversion it seems that Capt Woods who had spoken before the counsel for petitioner spoke arose in the bar and made the statement in question Petitioner Petitioner submits that the statement was wholly improper The necessary inference from it was that public sentiment in the commun ity was so adverse to petitioner as to constrain Capt Woods to prosecute without compensation his friend of twenty years standing If Capt Woods had made that statement out of court to any member of the jury or to the jury as a whole and the matter had come to the attention of the court it would or should have resulted in a discharge of the jury That the improper statement was made in court does not materially alter the matter since the court did not direct the jury to disregard it Indeed the jury could not possibly have disregarded the statement if they had been told The effect therefore was the same It was an unwarranted state ment calculated to improperly influence the jury Capt Woods had no right to pose before the jury as prompted or impelled by considerations which appealed unfairly to the jury The statement made by him was not a matter which the Commonvealth could have given in evidence or which the jury were entitled to know Nor was it justified by the criticism of Capt Woods for appearing against his friend of twventy years standing He had no right in the first place to state as he did state in his address to the jury that he had been the friend of petitioner for twenty years That statement of itself was calculated and intended to unjustly prejudice petitioner No man has a right to use his friendship or pretended friend ship for another to the disadvantage and undoing of that other and so when Capt Woods undertook to throw his professed long friendship for petitioner into the scales against him he took an unjust and unwarranted advantage of petitioner It would be difficult to conceive a more insidious injury or wrong to a person resting under a serious charge than his prose cutor posing before the jury as his friend The conduct and bearing of an impartial person towards and his statements concerning another charged with crime will ordinarily be accorded only due weight but the conduct and statements of one professing friendship of long standing and claiming to occupy the exalted attitude of sacrificing longtried friendship to the higher demands of public justice is well calculated to pervert the minds and in flame the feelings ot both the jury and the populace To the well informed such exploitations of simulated concern for the accused may indeed seem cheap and tawdry but unfortunately the views and opinions of such are seldom the prevailing ones when prejudice and public clamor are exercising their trunsient but strenuous sway In Cohn v State 11 Tex App 399 the district attorney in the course of his argument said Good meil in this county and the best men in Gon zales county desire the conviction of this man and his partner To the defendants objection to these remarks the court responded He speaks at his peril I will sign your bill of exceptions882 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb Hurt J in delivering the opinion of the Court of Appeals said This response of the judge is astounding indeed Considering the very obnoxious and flagrant remarks of the district attorney we cannot con ceive how it were possible for any person save defendant to be in peril That the district attorney was not is very evident from the fact that de fendants motion for a new trial was promptly overruled We are left to conclude from the latter part of the remark towit I will sign your bill of exceptions that the danger or peril was to be at the hands of this court if so we are equal to the occasion for we will not permit one accused of theft or any other offense to be conlvicted by such means though all the good better or best men of this State desire his conviction See 9 Am St Rep 5634 Petitioner commends this action of the Supreme Court of Texas to this court While Capt Woods did not say to the jury in so many words that the community demanded the conviction of petitioneralbeit distinguished for twenty years by his friendshiphe conveyed that information much more effectually He conveyed it by the statement in effect that although his relation to petitioner was such that he could not be induced by mere nioney to prosecute him nevertheless the demand of the community for petitioners coinviction was so great that petitioners friend was not staunch enough to withstand it On the 12th day of January 1905 the court having considered the said judgment of the Corporation Court of the City of Char lottesville and inspected the transcript of the record of the said judgment being of opinion that the said judgment was plainly right did reject the original petition and refuse to grant the writ of error and supersedeas On the 17th day of January the petitioner filed the following supplemental petition asking the court to set aside its judgment rendered on the 12th day of January 1905 and grant a rehearing thereon To the Honorable Judges of tlhe Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia Your petitioner J Samuel McCue humbly and respectfully submits this his supplemental petition for a writ of error and supersedeas to the judg ment of the Corporation Court of the City of Charlottesville pronounced on the 9th day of November 1904 whereby petitioner was coindemned to be hanged on January 20 1905 or if by reason of the refusal of petition ers original petition by this honorable court on to wit the 12th day of January 1905 a supplemenital petition be inappropriate in the premises then petitioner asks that this be regarded and treated as a petition to re hear the judgment of this court entered on the day and date last aforesaid refusing the said writ The particular matter which petitioner desires now to press upon the consideration of the court is that the errors assigned by him in his original1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 883 petition are of such character as to entitle him at least to a hearing by this honorable court albeit from such examination and consideration as the honorable members of the court have been able to give petitioners case in the short time at their disposal they may entertain the opinion that the judgmenb complained of is right Petitioner humbly submits that the right of appeal to this honorable court where human life is the stake and a fair opportunity of being heard at its bar by counsel is one which according to the theory practice and traditions of the government of this Commonwealth can be almost classed among the absolute rights of mankind If indeed the grounds upon which such right is invoked be frivolous or unimportant or be such as have already been adjudicated and settled by this court after full argument against the contention of the appellant then undoubtedly should this court refuse to entertain the appeal and not suffer the dignity and authority of the court to be trifled with But where the matter relied upon is material to the condemned and such as may have brought about his condemnation and where the correctness and regularity of the judgment complained of is in good faith called in question upon points which have not been subjected to the test of the judi cial scrutiny of this court after full argument at its bar and which do in fact engage the serious consideration of the court and the profession at large refusal to hear argument is the denial of a right within the contem plation of the law of the land The unquestioned right of an accused person to the benefit of counsel is practically denied if the counsel be simply permitted to assign error in a petition to the court and have no opportunity to answer or combat the rea sons by which the court is influenced in deciding adversely It may be that in the estimation of the court the grounds of its decision are impregnable but the question is when human life is the stake ought the court however eminent it be and however obscure the counsel to con clude the matter until its reasons have been subjected to the test of a fair and full opportunity of combating them when the case presented in several important aspects is one of first impression in this Commonwealth It is inmpossible in any such case as petitioners for counsel however diligent to anticipate the difficulties which will arise in the minds of the court Indeed many of the questions for adjudication being new and the case itself involving the weightiest consideration within the realm of hu ian jurisdiction petitioners counsel did not realize that it was necessary to attemnpt to anticipate in their presentation of the case in the petition all that might be urged from the adversary standpoint They naturally and reasonablv expected an opportunity to combat the adverse view in the argiiiiment before the court Several of the questions at least are new and hithierto unadjudicated in this Statenotably the question as to the jury reading newspapers and that concerning the construction and scope of the recent anmeidment of sec 3351 of the Code in reference to a party impeach ing his owvn witness In regard to the first of these it has been stated in the press that the884 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTEEt Feb ground upon which this court overruled the objection was that the jury asked permission of the court to read newspapers and petitioner did not then object Be it so But 1 the matter was not mentioned to the peti tioner or his counsel whose views in regard thereto it was not deemed material to consult or consider and 2 it was understood that the jurors were pledged not to read anything in reference to thie case on trial where as in fact they or some of them did do so But has it ever occurred to this honorable court how unjust it was to place petitioner in the position of being called upon to object or be con cluded by his silence The trial was likely to last a month the jurors were brought from their homes and taken from their business and were to remain in substantial captivity for an indefinite periodcut off from inter course with society and the world To deny them the privilege of reading the newspapers was not a matter to which they were likely to submit kind ly they would undoubtedly esteem it a hardship if their request were denied and in view of the understanding that they were not to read any thing about the case would have regarded any objection as a reflection upon their integrity as well Petitioners life was in the hollow of their hands Is it not then a monstrous proposition that the trial judge could shift the responsibility of dealing with this matter from his own shoulders to those of petitioner In reference to the impeachment of the witness introduced by the Com monwealth it is certain that the statute cannot be so construed as to allow a party greater latitude in impeaching his own witness than he is allowed in impeaching the witness of his adversary This court has held Lanqg horne v Commonwealth 76 Va 1019 that the test whether a statement by a witness introduced by the adversary made in answer to a question put by the party proposing to impeach the witness can be contradicted is whether the party offering to contradict could give in evidence the contra dictory matter if the witness had not denied it and petitioners counsel in their investigation of the subject have not encountered a single case hold ing that the opinion of a witness could be proved in order to contradict him except in the case of an expert witness who having given his expert opinion in evidence may be contradicted by showing that he had expressed a contradictory opinion elsewhere It is impossible to believe that the legislature meant to make the mere opinion of a witness as to the very fact of the guilt of an accused person admissible in any case it is equally im possible to say that admission of such opinion was harmless Does this court mean to be understood as holding that it is plainly right that a juror who says himself that he has made up and expressed a de cided opinion should be admitted to the panel That it is plainly right to allow jurymen to read adverse newspaper comments upon the case on trial That it is plainly right that the opinion of the son of an accused person touching the very fact of guilt should be given in evidence against him And will this court deny the accused the poor privilege of an oppor tinity of trying to dissuade you from this view by debating the matter with you at your bar1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 885 There is an instance on record in which a judgmentnot rendered by a human tribunal against an individual but by the Almighty against a whole peoplewas reversed upon reargument See Exodus XXXII 7 14 Is it then too much to ask of this court that it so far reconsider its judg ment in this case as to hear argument of it Do not the members of this court owe it indeed to the Commonwealth to hear argumeiht before they pass judgment upon petitioner While it may seem inapposite in one under condemnation of death to urge upon the court considerations affecting the general welfare of the Commonwealth whose court of last resort has adjudged him unworthy to live nevertheless he is advised that he is entitled to salvation though it must be worked out through rights which those to whom they appertain would disown and deny It is a fundamental principle of the common law that the adjudication of the highest tribunal or court of last resort shall stand as rules of law in all similar cases This makes it necessary that all such decisions should be accessible and examinable But when the court declares the law on im portant questions for the first time by refusing a writ of error the prin ciples so declared are not accessible no one can lay hands upon them they afford no guide for the fuature they vanish and make no sign But far worse than that they tend to the exercise of irresponsible arbitrary power and this in turn to injustice and tyranny The good people of this Com monwealth have no assurance that their highest tribunal will always be constituted as now of exalted and pure judges and if it shall fortune in some evil time to come that her bench shall be filled by judges such as have more than once found their way to the bench of the country from which we derive our jurisprudence it may be that in this very case will be found the pretext of a precedent for the utter denial of the right to the benefit of counsel and the constitutional right to be confronted by ones accusers and the witnesses against him Safety comes to a people and life liberty and property are secure when no man can be deprived of either except in the due orderly and customary course of the law of the land in a tribunal which observes the laws for its regulation according to their spirit and true intent It is far more important that the law should pursue such course always than that any particular result however desirable in any particular ca se should be reached in any other way Lord Chancellor Bacon in swearing in one of the judges of the court of conimon pleas enjoined upon him that he should take care to contain the jurisdiction of the court within the ancient merestones without removing the mark We commend these salutary words of one of the wisest and greatest judges to your honors Petitioner has reason to believe that some at least of the assignments of error in his case challenged the serious consideration of every member of the court If so he humbly contends that by the law of the land as reflected by the practice and traditions of this court he was entitled to have his case argued by counsel886 10 VIRGINrA LAW REGISTER Feb Even if your honors have reached the conclusion from the evidence certi fied that petitioner is guilty he begs to remind you that under the Consti tution of this Commonwealth that question can be decided only by an impartial jury acting upon proper evidence and uninfluenced by any other consideration If any juror was not impartial if any evidence was not proper if any juror read anything in a newspaper during the trial which may have influenced him or prejudiced petitioner in his estimation then petitioner is entitled to a new trial no matter if this court do think there was proper evidence sufficient to establish his guilt because the law of the land does not contemplate the conviction of accused persons but by the verdict of a unanimously impartial jury upon legal and proper evidence and nothing else Petitioner prays that the judgment of this court refusing the writ of error and supersedeas be reheard reviewed and reversed and that the writ prayed for be granted And he will ever pray etc J SAMUEL MCCUE By JOHN L LEE J T COLEMAN WALIER  SIlCLAIR His Counsel The court gave the following twentynine instructions to the jury Those numbered from one to thirteen both inclusive were given at the instance of the Commonwealth and the remaining sixteen at the instance of the accused the couirt however having first modified and amended one of the last named instructions number 21 against the objection of the accused To the giving of the eighth ninth tenth elevenith and twelfth of said instructions the accused excepted 1 The court instructs the jury that the rule of law is that a man shall be taken to intend that which he does or which is a necessary conse quence of his act 2 The court further instructs the jury that whenever the killing is wilful deliberate and premeditated the law infers malice from this fact 3 The court instructs the jury that every homicide in Virginia is presum ed in law to be murder in the second degree In order to elevate the offense to murder in the first degree the burden of proof is upon the Common wealth and to reduce the offense to mnanslaughter the burden of proof is upon the prisoner 4 The court instructs the jury that murder is distinguished by the law ii Virginia as murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree 5 The court further instructs the jury that circumstantial evidence is legal and competent in criminal cases annd if it is of such a character as to ex clude every reasonable hypothesis other than that the defendant is guilty is entitled to the same weight as direct testimony1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 887 6 The court instructs the jury that whoever kills a human being with ma lice aforethought is guilty of murder that a murder which is perpetrated by poison lying in wait or any other kind of wilful deliberate and pre meditated killing is murder in the first degree 7 The court instructs the jury that the credibility of witnesses is a ques tion exclusively for the jury and the law is that where a number of witnesses testify directly opposite to each other the jury is not bound to regard the weight of the evidence as equally balanced the jury have the right to de termine from the appearance of the witnesses on the stand their manner of testifying and their apparent candor and fairness their apparent intel ligence or lack of intelligence and fromi all the other surrounding circum stances appearing on the trial which witnesses are more worthy of credit and to give credit accordingly 8 The court instructs the jury that a reasonable doubt is such a doubt as may be honestly and reasonably entertained as to anv substantial and ma terial fact essential to prove the offense charged Reasonable doubt must be based upon the evidence or that is suggested by the evidence or grows out of the evidence itself It must not be arbitrary doubt without evidence to sustain it It must be serious and substantial in order to wvarrant an acquittal It must be a doubt of material fact or facts necessary for the jury to believe to find a verdict of conviction and not of immaterial and nonessential circumstances 9 The court instructs the jury as a matter of law that in considering the case the jury are not to go beyond the evidence to hunt up doubts nor must they entertain such doubts as are merely chimerical or conjectural A doubt to justify an acquittal must be reasonable doubt and it must arise from a candid and impartial investigation of all the evidence in the case and inless it is such that were the same kind of doubt interposed in the graver transactions of life it would cause a reasonable and prudent man to hesitate and pause it is insufficient to authorize a verdict of not guilty lf after considering all the evidence you can say that you have an abiding conviction of the truth of the charge you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the other hand the jury miist not go beyond the evi dence to hunt up inferences of guilt 10 The court instructs the Jury that on a charge of murder malice is pre sumed from the fact of killing When the killing is proved and is unac companied with circumstances of palliation the burden of disproving ma lice is thrown upon the accused 11 The court further instructs the jury that to constitute a wilful deliber ate and premeditated killing it is not necessary the intention to kill should exist any particular length of time prior to the actual killing It is only necessary that such intention should come into existence for the first time at the time of killing or any time previously 12 The court further instructs the jury that a mortal wound given with a deadly weapon in the previous possession of the slayer without any provo cationl or even with slight provocation is prima facie wilful deliberate888 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb and premeditated killing and throws upon the prisoner the necessity of showing extenuating circumstances 13 The court further instructs the jury that in determining the weight to be given the testimony of different witnesses in this case the jury are author ized to consider the relationship of the witnesses to the parties if the same is proved their interests if any in the result of this case their temper feeling or bias if any has been shown their demeanor whilst testifying their apparent intelligence and their means of information and to give such credit to the testimony of such witnesses as under all the circum stances such witness seem to be entitled to 14 The court instructs the jury that in all criminal prosecutions a man has a right to be confronted with his accusers and the witnesses against him and no statement made by any witness or other person elsewhere than in the court and in the presence of the accused constitutes evidence against him The sole purpose for which evidence of any such statement is ad mitted or for which it can be used is to enable the jury to judge whetlher or not the witness is entitled to credit 15 The court instructs the jury that the law presumes every person charg ed with crime to be innocent until his guilt is established by the Common wealth beyond a reasonable doubt and this presumption of innocence goes with the accused through the entire case and applies at every stage thereof and if after having heard all of the evidence in this case the jury have a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused upon the whole case or as to any fact essential to prove the charge niade against him in the indictment it is their duty to give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty 16 The court instructs the jury that the failure of the accused to testify creates no presumption against him and in considering his guilt or inno cence his failure to testify is not a circumstance which the jury are en titled to consider 17 The court instructs the jury that murder by poison lying in wait im prisonment starving or any wilful deliberate and premeditated killing or in the commission of or attempt to commit arson rape robbery or burg lary is murder of the first degree All other murder is murder of the second degree 18 The court further instructs the jury that uponi the trial of this cause if a reasonable doubt of any fact necessary to establish the guilt of accused as charged in the indictmient be raised by the evidence or lack of evidence such doubt is decisive and the jury must acquit the accused since a verdict of not guilty means no more than that the guilt of the accused has not been established in the precise specific and narrow form prescribed by law 19 The court instructs the jury that even though they may believe from the evidence that the witnesses William McCue and John Perry may have made statements in conflict with or in contradiction of the evidence given by them on the witness stand in considering the guilt or innocence of the accused of the crime with which he is charged the jury are not at liberty to take into consideration any sich contradictory or conflicting statements1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 889 of the said witnesses or either of them but must consider the case of the accused as if such statements had never been made except that they may consider such statements for the sole purpose of determining whether said witnesses or either of them are worthy of belief 20 The court instructs the jury even if they are satisfied from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused took the life of the deceased then the jury are instructed that the law presumes prima facie that such killing was murder of the second degree and the burden rests upon the Commonwealth to elevate the offense to murder in the first degree by prov ing beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of that crime as defined by another instruction 21 The court instructs the jury that all statements which they may believe from the evidence were made by William McCue the son of the accused or John Perry to other persons not in the presence of the accused can only be considered by the jury for the purpose of discrediting the said William McCue and the said John Perry and the jury are instructed that such state ment should not be considered by them as evidence against the accused but only for the purpose above stated and said statements should in consider ing the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused be wholly disre garded by the jury and treated as if they had never been made 22 The court instructs the jury that if upon the whole evidence in the case there is any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused they must find him not guilty 23 The court instructs the jury that upon the trial of a criminal case by a jury the law contemplates a concurrence of twelve minds in the conclusion of guilt before a conviction can be had Not only is this true with respect to the guilt of the accused but it is likewise true with respect to the degree of the crime Therefore although the jury may believe from the evidence that the accused is guilty of the killing of the deceased still if any indi vidual member of the jury after having duly considered all of the evidence in this case and after a consultation with his fellowjurors should enter tain a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt of the accused it is his duty not to surrender his own convictions as to such degree of guilt simply because the balance of the jury entertain different convictions with respect to such degree 24 The court instructs the jury that the failure of the evidence to disclose any other criminal agent than the accused is not a circumstance which may be considered by the jury in determining whether or not he was guilty of the crime wherewvith he is charged The prisoner is presumed to be inno cent until his guilt is established and he is not to be prejudiced by the inability of the Commonwealth to point any other criminal agent nor is he called upon to vindicate his own innocence by naming the guilty person 25 The court instructs the jury that upon the trial of a criminal case by a jury the law contemplates the concurrence of twelve minds in the conclu sion of guilt before a conviction can be had Each individual juror must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendants guilt before he can uinder his oatli consent to a verdict of guilty Each juror should feel890 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb the responsibility resting upon him as a member of the jury and should realize that his own mind must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendants guilt before he can consent to a verdict of guilty There fore if any individual member of the jury after having duly considered all of the evidence in this case and after consultation with his fellow jurors should entertain such reasonable doubt of the defendants guilt as is set forth in certain other instructions in this case it is his duty not to surrender his own convictions simply because the balance of the jury enter tain different convictions 26 The court instructs the jury that where evidence is adduced of any state ment of the accused such statement must be considered as a whole A part of it cannot be considered and a part rejected The jury must consider all or none and if the prosecutor uses the declaration of the prisoner he must take the whole together and cannot select one part and leave another 27 The court instructs the jury that when upon a charge of muLrder the evidence is wholly circumstantial as is the case here the absence of all evidence of an inducing cause or motive to commit the offense charged af fords of itself a strong presumption of innocence 28 The court instructs the jury that in the application of circumstantial evidence to the determination of the case the utmost caution and vigilancee should be used Such evidence is always insufficient where assuming all to be true which the evidence tends to prove some other reasonable hypo thesis may still be true for it is the actual exclusion of every other reason able hypothesis wvhich invests mere circumstances with the force of truth Where the evidence leaves it indifferent which of several hypotheses is true or establishes only some finite probability in favor of one hypothesis such evidence cannot amount to proof however great the probability may be And the court further instructs the jury that all the evidence in this case which tends to establish that the accused is guilty of the crime with which he is charged is circumstantial and not positive evidence Therefore al though the jury may believe from the evidence in this case that there is a strong probability that the accused is guilty of the offense charged in the indictment still if upon the whole evidence there is any other reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence they cannot find the accused guilty and this is true although it may appear from the evidence that the probabilities of his guilt are greater than the probabilities of his innocence 29 The jury are finally instructed that the instructions given are all the instructions of the court and must be considered as a whole Lee  Howard Caskie  Coleman Daniel Harman Walker d Sinclair and E 0 McCuc for petitioner Mllicajah Woods Kerr  Kerr and Frank Gilmer Common wealths Attorney for the Commonwealth  Mr Harman withdrew from the case at an early stage on account of sickness1905 J 8SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 891 KEITH P Petitioner was indicted by a grand jury in the Corporation Court of the City of Charlottesville on September 19 1904 for the mur der on the 4th of September preceding of his wife Fannie M1 McCue At a subsequent term of the court he was tried upon this indictment and on the5th day of November the jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree the court sentenced him to be hanged and he thereupon applied to this court for a writ of error which was refused thecourt being of opinion that the judgment complained of was plainly right At a subsequent day a supple mentary petition was filed asking the court to rehear its judgment refusing tbe writ of error and upon the original and supplemental petitions the case is now before us for consideration The first assignment of error is to the judgment of the Corpora tion Court upon a plea filed by the petitioner in Which he alleges that Lyman one of the grand jurors finding the indictment was not a resident of the city of Charlottesville To this plea the Com monwealth by its attorney filed a replication Thereupon the court empaneled a jury and made up and propounded to it the issue whether or not said Lyman was at the time of finding the in dictment a resident of the city of Charlottesville This issue was found by the jury in the affirmative and the action of the court in overruling prisoners motion to set aside the verdict and entering judgment thereon constitutes the petitioners first assignment of error It was decided in Commonwealth v Cherry 2 Virginia Cases 20 that by force of the common law where a bill of indictment is found by a grand jury one of whom is an alien or otherwise dis qualified by law the bill or presentment may be avoided by plea Commonwealth v Lang Ib 318 In Commorwealth v St Clair 1 Gratt 568 it was pleaded in abatement to the indictment that one of the grand jurors was not a freeholder Upon that plea an issue was made up tried at the bar of the court by a jury the issue found for the defendant and the indictment quashed In Day v Commornwealth 2 Gratt 563 the prisoner plead in abatement that one of the grand jurors was at the time of finding the indictment a surveyor of a highway To this plea the attorney for the Commonwealth replied generally and thereupon the court892 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb decided the issue against the prisoner The general court was of opinion that the issue so joined was one of fact and that it should have been submitted to a jury and for this error the judgment was reversed and a new trial awarded Counsel for petitioner criticised tlle replication which the court permitted to be filed to the plea in this case upon the ground that it concludes with an offer to verify when it should have been to the country We shall not stop to inquire into this nicety of pleading The injury of which the petitioner complained was that he had been indicted by a grand jury upon which there was a juror incompetent by reason of the fact that he was not a resident of the city of Char lottesville That issue was submitted to a jury which heard the evidence and decided it against him We cannot permit the grave interests presented in this case to be determined upon a considera tion so trivial It is certain that no right of the prisoner was preju diced by the ruling of which he complains The verdict of the jury upon this issue must be considered in this court as upon a demur rer to evidence and the evidence was in our judgment so consid ered sufficient to sustain it The second assignment of error is as to the qualification of the petit juror J Y Stockdell who was challenged by the petitioner He was asked if he had formed or expressed an opinion to which he replied I formed an opinion on the newspaper evidence He was reminded by counsel that in law the prisoner was presumed to be innocent and he was asked In your present state of mind could you go on that jury starting out with that presumption of innocence in your mind A I could not say that I could sir for the reason that I have read this evidence Naturaily there is some impression on my mind but I cannot say that it is biased or prejudiced The only thing 1 have heard is one side as published in the newspapers I must say that everything I read in the news papers was one side After further question and answer counsel asked the juror this question In spite of what you have read and heard you could go upon this jury and give the prisoner a fair and impartial trial according to the instructions of the court and the evidence as detailed by the witnesses A I feel that I am a fairminded man Q But I also understand Mr Stockdell that what you have read of this case has destroyed in your mind1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 893 the presumption of the prisoners innocence that you would not go on the jury presuming him to be innocent A I dont know about that It is a question as to drawing a line between thinking him innocent and knowing him to be guilty which I dont know In answer to other questions the juror stated that as a fair minded man I could render a verdict according to the law and the evidence not biased I have no prejudice one way or other and that as to innocence or guilt he would be governed by the evidence and the instructions of the court After numerous questions had been asked and reiterated the object of which was to ascertain the precise character and strength of the opinion which the juror had formed and expressed counsel asked him the following question Do you feel at this moment that there is a presumption in your mind that this defendant is an innocent man To which he replied I would like to say this that I feel that I am an honest and unbiased man and as such that I could enter this jury unprejudiced and unbiased and give the prisoner a trial according to the law and the evidence If I did not feel so I would want to be turnecL out but at the same time I feel that I could serve and am called here to serve and that it is therefore my duty to serve By the court  Do you feel that you can go into this trial leaving your mind open to the evidence free from any previously read accounts in the newspapers and go through the trial believing him innocent until he is proved guilty  A Yes sir And thereupon the juror was accepted The cases upon this subject are almost without number and they are not to be reconciled The trend of recent decisions is in the direction of limiting rather than extending the disqualification of jurors by reason of mere opinion Whatever the mind receives has an effect upon it passing with almost infinite graduation from a mere impression to a fixed belief The State strains every nerve to disserninate knowledge By the diffusion of education it hopes to create a higher citizenship and to find the means of repressing vice and crime but if the courts take an extreme position upon this subject and hold that every opinion shall work a disqualification for service as a juror the administration of justice will be confided not to the most intelligent but to the most ignorant of our citi894 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb zens The courts therefore while resolute in seeing that every man shall be tried by an impartial jury inquire into the quality and degree of the opinion and to that end search the conscience of the juror upon his voir dire and look into the sources of the infor mation upon which his opinion rests No man can read the rigid examination to which this juror was subjected without being impressed with his fairness with his de sire to deal justly by the prisoner and with his conscientious pur pose to discharge his duty as a citizen In Morans Case 9 Leigh 651 two jurors were examined upon their voir dire One stated that he had heard the case spoken of in the town and rumors in regard to its circumstances upon which he had expressed no opinion though he believes those rumors to be true and if they should turn out upon the trial to be true he has a decided opinion in regard to the case but he feels no preju dice and is satisfied that he shall be able to decide the case upon the evidence which may be given in uninfluenced by the rumors he had heard His opinion was that if the prisoner had Ftabbed the deceased under the circumstances which he had heard he ought to be punished The other juror stated that he had made up no de cided opinion that he had heard a part of the evidence of one wit ness and formed an impression and if the balance of the testimony should run that way that impression would be confirmed that so far as the evidence went he had a decided opinion if the rest should not run against it but that he had no prejudice had not expressed any opinion and was prepared to decide the case according to the evidence which might be given in uninfluenced by the portion of evidence he had heard Both jurors were held to be competent In Smith v Commonwealth 6 Gratt 696 a juror stated that he had read the evidence as published in the newspapers and had formed and expressedthe opinion though it was not a decided one that the prisoner was guilty that he was satisfied that he could give the prisoner a fair and impartial trial notwithstanding his impressions and without being influenced bv them on hearing the evidence adduced at the trial Another tated that he had formed and expressed a decided opinion founded on a report of the evi dence before thbe mayor puLblished in the papers but not such an opinion as would influence his mind if accepted as a juryman that the opinion so formed would naturallv be recalled to his imemory1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 895 but that he would be governed solely by the evidence which might be given in court Held that both were competent jurors In Clores Case 8 Gratt 606 a juror stated that he had not heard any of the evidence nor bad be beard any report of it from those who had heard it but from the rumor of the neighborhood he had formed an opinion which at the time he spoke was existing on his mind and which he should stick to unless the evidence turn ed out to be different from what rumor had reported it to be that he had no prejudice nor partiality for or against the prisoner and believed he could give him a fair and impartial trial according to the evidence that should be given in Held that he was a proper juror In Jacksons Case 23 Gratt 919 Judge Moncure delivering the opinion of the court goes fully into this subject He says There is no question perhaps about which there has been more apparent conflict of decision in this State or in regard to which it is more difficult to derive from our many cases on the subject any definite rules which will apply to all cases that may arise The object of the law is to secure to every man who is charged with a criminal offense a trial by an impartial jury and this rule has been estab lished by the cases if no other that if a venireman has formed and still more if he has formed and expressed a decided or sub stantial opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused no inat ter upon what ground it was formed whether from having heard the evidence on some former trial or examination or from mere rumor or otherwise he is an incompetent juror to try the case and if on the other hand his opinion be merely hypothetical he is not incompetent on that ground The difficulty is in determining in any given case whether the opinion be decided or substantial or merely hypothetical there being in almost every case some peculiar ity of circumstance And the desire to remove or lessen this dif ficulty by laying down certain other rules for our guidance has been the fruitful source of the apparent conflict in many of the cases Thus if a venireman has formed an opinion as to the guilt or in nocence of the accused from having heard the evidence on a former trial or examination of the case it would be difficult if not impos sible to regard such opinion otherwise than as decided or substan tial within the meaning of the rule and he would generallv if not always be considered an incompetent juror even though he might896 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb think and say that he could give the accused an impartial trial So on the other hand if a venireman has formed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused from mere rumor the presuimp tion in the absence of evidence to the contrary is that such opinion is merely hypothetical and will be so considered even though he speak of it as a decided or substantial opinion if he says he has no prejudice against the accused and thinks he can give him a fair and impartial trial But if the court be satisfied either from the venire mans own statement or otherwise that the opinion is in fact de cided or substantial he will be an incompetent juror There are intermediate cases which often give rise to difficulty on this subject The veniremen may have formed an opinion from having heard a part only of the evidence on a former trial or from having heard the whole or part of the evidence given on a former trial through persons who were present in whose veracity and accuracy he may have more or less confidence or from having read an account of such evidence in a newspaper We cannot lay down any rule for the government of such cases except the general rule before stated and the court must determine as best it may whether the opinion be decided or substantial or merely hypothetical It would be dan gerous to lay down a rule and no case has ever decided that a venireman who has formed an opinion from accounts received from witnesses out of court and still less from accounts received fron others as to statements made by witnesses either in or out of court is therefore necessarily an incompetent juror even though he may regard the persons from whom he received his information as per sons of general veracity and accuracy and may credit what he has heard from them We know that witnesses who make statements out of court of transactions about which they may have testified in court still more persons who profess to detail what they may have heard in or out of court often speak carelessly and generally omit ting particulars which may be very material And we know that those who listen to them often listen carelessly and though they almost always form some impression or opinion of the case fronm what they hear yet that opinion is not always and perhaps not often decided or substantial in the meaning of the rule aforesaid The court must determine that question in all such cases in view of all the circumstances In the course of his opinion he cites numerous authorities and1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 897 quotes with approval the language of Judge Summers in Morans Case supra in which he uses the following language Sustaining challenges to jurors for favor on slight grounds tends to place the administration of public justice in the hands of the most ignorant and least discriminating portion of the community by which the safety of the accused may be endangered and the proper adminis tration of the laws put to hazard and we are therefore not dis posed to enlarge the grounds of challenge beyond those properly deducible from the cases heretofore decided As we have said the cases are not reconcilable but we believe those wehave cited establish a wise and salutary rule When to these considerations it is added as has been frequently reiterated by this court that great weight is justly due to the opinion of the trial judge who sees and hears the veniremen we have no hesitation in rejecting this assignment of error These considerations lead to the same conclusion with reference to the juror Wood The next exception is as to the competency of the witness Kauf man who was introduced by the Commonwealth to prove that a piece of cloth found in the bath room on the day following the al leged homicide was a part of the undershirt worn by the prisoner on that occasion Kaufman it appears is engaged in the clothing business and is a salesman of and dealer in underwear but has never manufactured it Fontaine Eddins a clerk in a clothing store was introduced for the same purpose and both were permitted to testify over the objection of the prisoner In this there was no error It was for the court to say what evi dence should be admitted It was for the jury before whom the witnesses were subjected to investigation as to their source of knowledge to determine upon their credibility and the weight to be given to their testimony The eleventh exception is to the admission of a conversation be tween the prisoner and his son William McCue as testified to for the Commonwealth by the witness Martin In this conversation petitioner according to the witness said that he his son knew that the statement made by Ernest Crawford about petitioners having drawn a pistol upon his wife was not true to which peti tioners son replied by affirming that petitioner did draw a pistol898 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb upon his wife This is objected to upon the ground that there is no suggestion or approximation with respect to the time at which the occurrence took place which was the subject of this conversa tion that it nowhere appears whether it was a week or a month or a year or five years or ten years before the homicide The testimony with respect to the incident in the jail was not in troduced as proof of the circumstance narrated It does not pr ve or tend to prove and there was no purpose in its introduction to prove that the accused at any time threatened his wife with a pistol and that she sought the protection of her son Ernest Crawford had testified before the jury that William McCue so stated to him and Martins testimony was introduced solely for the purpose of showing that McCue endeavored to induce his son to denv the statement attributed to him by Crawford If the circumstance to which Craw ford referred was inadmissible for remoteness in point of time or for any other reason objection to it should have been made when Crawford was upon the stand but there could be no objection to it when introduced for the purpose indicated The precise language of the prisoner on that occasion was as fol lows The prisoner said to his son You know it is not so about what Ernest Crawford said about my drawing a pistol on your mother To which the son replied You did and she run in the room and got in the bed with me and asked me not to let yot shoot her Nor is the testimony of Martin inadmissible because in effect an accusation against the prisoner which he then and there controverted and denied The conversation was brought about by the prisoner who was apparently seeking to find the means of weakening the force of Crawfords statement and he said to his son You know it is not true that I drew a pistol on your mother and the denial comes from the son You did and she run in the room and got in the bed with me and asked me not to let you shoot her What was said with all the attending circumstances was before the jury and we are of opinion that there was no error in this rul ing of the court There are several exceptions to evidence which seem to us to be immaterial and to discuss which would unduly protract this opin ion That for instance of the witness Covington who testified that he spoke to petitioners wife at about twenty minutes before 81905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 899 oclock that he took off his hat and bowed to her but that she did not speak of the witness Hurley who heard the prisoner say that his wifes jealousy diminished his pleasure and enjoyment in life The fifteenth exception is to the testimony of Dr Nelson who was permitted to testify as to the effects of a blow struck by a sand bag or other similar instrument It hardly requires the learning or experience of a practitioner of medicine to know that if a man was struck by a sand bag a blow sufficient to render him unconscious there would be at least some slight discoloration or external mark or after effect consequent upon the blow This assignment of error is also overruled The assignments of error from the sixteenth to thirtythird in clusive present a question of much importance in this prosecution William McCue a son of the prisoner was introduced as a wit ness by the Commonwealth and it speedily appearing that he was adverse to the Commonwealth and favorable to the prisoner the Commonwealth alleging that it was surprised asked and was per mitted to introduce evidence to show that the witness had made statements inconsistent with his testimony So much of sec 3351 of Va Code 1904 as is pertinent to this inquiry is as follows A party called to testify for another having an adverse interest may be examined by such other party according to the rules applicable to cross examination 1 A party producing a witness shall not be allowed to impeach his credit by general evidence of bad character but he may in case the witness shall in the opinion of the court prove adverse contradict him by other evidence or by leave of the court prove that he has made at other times a statement inconsistent with his present testimony but before said last mentioned proof can be given the circumstances of the supposed statement sufficient to designate the particular occasion must be mentioned to the witness and he must be asked whether or not he has made such statement In every case the court if requested by either party shall instruct the jury not to consider the evidence of such inconsistent statements except for the purpose of contradicting the witness The law just quoted is so comprehensive in its terms that we shall content ourselves with observing that it warrants the action of the court in this case unless as the petitioner insists its opera tion is to be confined to civil cases The law of evidence is in general the same in civil and in criminal cases In each case the object is the sameto place evidence before the jury which will900 1 0 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb enable it to arrive at a just decision upon the issues It has long been a subject of investigation before the court textwriters and legislatures how far it is permissible for a party to contradict his own witness In Wigmore on Evidence vol 2 sees 897 to 908 inclusive the whole subject is exhaustively discussed and the views of eminent authorities given Lord Ellenborough is quoted as saying in Alexander v Gibson 2 Camip 555 If a witness is called on the part of the plaintiff who swears what is palpably false it would be extremely hard if the plaintiffs case should for that reason be sacrificed but I know of no rule of law by which the truth is on such an occasion to be shlut out and justice is to be perverted Chief Justice Tindals remarks in Bradley v Ricardo 8 Bing 58 are cited The object of all the laws of evidence is to bring the whole truth of a case before the jury    but if this contradicting evidence were excluded that would no longer be tlie just ground on which the principles of evidence would proceed but we should compel the plaintiff to take singly all the chances of the tables and to be bound by the statements of a witness whom he might call without knowing he was averse who might labor under a defect of memory or be otherwise unable to make a statement on which complete reliance might be placed The reasoning and authorities range all the way from permission to refresh the memory of an adverse witness by crossexamination to the practice which finds expression in the statute under consid eration of proving his inconsistent statements In England the subject was referred to a commission composed of eminent jurists and they reported in favor of the admission of impeaching testimony by proof of contradictory statements For the admissibilityof the proposed evidence it is said that this course is necessary as a security against the contrivance of an artful wit ness who otherwise might recommend himself to the party by the promise of favorable evidence being really in the interest of the opposite party and afterwards by hostile evidence ruin his cause that such a power is necessary for the purpose of placing the wvit iiess fairly and completely before the court and for enabling the jury to ascertain how far he deserves to be believed that the ends of justice are best attained by allowing the fullest power for scruti1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 901 nizing and correcting evidence and that the exclusion of the proof of contrary statements might be attended with the worst conse quences The chief objection to the proposed evidence appears to be that a party after calling a witness as a witness of credit ought not to be allowed to discredit him The objection proceeds upon the supposition that the party first acts on one principle and after wards being disappointed by the witness turns around and acts upon another thus imputing to the party something of double dealing or dishonest practice But it is evident that this does not apply to the case where a party having given credit to a witness is deceived by him and first discovers the deceit at the trial of the cause To reject the proposed evidence in such a case and repress the truth would be to allow the witness to deceive both jury and party In Babcock V People 13 Colo 519 Judge Elliott said The tendency of recent legislation as well as of modern decisions has been to relax somewhat the rules of evidence so as to afford better opportunity for the development of truth Modern experience has also shown that a party may sometines be deceived in the character and animus of a witness whom he has called as well as in the testi mony he is expected to give and he learnsi after the witness begins to testifya very inopportune timethat be has to encounter bit ter and unscrupulous opposition where he had expected to receive only fair and honorable treatment This may be evidenced by re luctance or evasion on the part of the witness in answering ques tions or by too great readiness in making or volunteering damaging statements contrary to his previous version of the matter Under such circumstances    in extreme cases where it is apparent that a witness is giving testimony contrary to the reasonable expec tation of the party calling him such party should be allowed to crossexamine such witness for the purpose of refreshing his recol lection with the view of modifving his testimony or of revealing his animus in the case    and to ask him if he has not theretofore made other or different statements from those he has just given in evidence In this whole discussion as given in Wigmore the reasoning ad duced and the authorities cited apply indifferently to civil and criminal cases the civil cases being of course far the more num erous902 10 VRGINA LAW REGISTER Feb The English statute is given passed in pursuance of the recom mendation of the commission on procedure heretofore referred to A party producing a witness shall not be allowed to impeach his credit by general evidence of bad character but he may in case the witness shall in the opinion of the judge prove adverse contradict him by other evidence or by leave of the judge prove that he has made at other times a statement inconsistent with his present testimony It is easy to imagine says the author the confusion caused by this bungling paragraph for the showing of an error by ordi nary contradiction provided for in clause 3 was already freely per missible without interference by the judge and whether or not the witness was adverse    As the statute stands the present class of evidence selfcontradictions is admissible only by leave of the judge and in case of a witness deemed adverse by the judge In the United States fortunately only a few jurisdictions have adopted the English statute But the variety of attitude in the dif ferent jurisdictions and the indiscriminate citation of rulings from other courts together with the indecision of the earlier English precedents has tended to produce confusion in our law even within the rulings of the same jurisdiction The sound and simple rem edy would be by statute to abolish all limitation on this kind of evidence and this step has in some States already been taken The English statute quoted was passed in the seventeenth and eighteenth of Victoria It applied only to civil cases but by statute of the twentyeighth and twentyninth of Victoria it was extended to criminal cases In Hickory v U S 151 U S 303 which was upon an indict ment for murder Chief Justice Fuller says When a party is taken by surprise by the evidence of his witness the latter may be interrogated as to inconsistent statements previously made by him for the purpose of refreshing his recollection and inducing him to correct his testimony and the party so surprised may also show the facts to be otherwise than as stated although this incidentally tends to discredit the witness    but proof of contradictory statements of ones own witness voluntarily called and not a party inasmuch as it would not amount to substantive evidence and could have no effect but to impair the credit of the witness was generally not admissible at common law1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 903 By statute in England and in many of the States it has been provided that a party may in case the witness shall in the opinion of the judge prove adverse by leave of the judge show that he has made at other times statements inconsistent with his present testi mony and this is allowed for the purpose of counteracting actual hostile testimony with which the party has been surprised This citatioli is of value in two aspects In the first place it shows what the common law was it shows the tendency of modern thought upon the subject and although made in a case where a man was on trial for his life rests the statements of law upon adjudications in civil cases Under these circumstances the Legislature of Virginia adopted the statute which we are now considering Its language is broad and general there is not a suggestion upon its face of the purpose to limit its operation to a particular class of cases The evils are the same in criminal cases as in civil It is invoked today by the Commonwealth it may be tomorrow the last hope of an innocent man Against all this it is urged that the statute is found in the Code under the title of Proceedings in Civil Cases Embraced in that title are a number of chapters upon a great variety of subjects many of which are obviously of a civil nature others specifically declared to be of that character In the chapter upon Evideiice in which sec 3351 is found there are sections which either from their sub ject matter or by their express terms apply to civil cases There are other sections which by their express terms apply to criminal cases for example secs 3346 3352 and 3352a the first mentioned referring to the competency of husband and wife to testify for or against each other in civil and criminal cases WNe find therefore sec 3351 placed in the midst of sections applicable alike by their terms to criminal and civil cases and the operatioil of that section not extended upon the one hand nor limited upon the other to a particular class of cases but its application to be determined by other considerations We cannot think that the mere collocation of this section should override every other consideration and require the courts to confine it to civil cases when it is a remedy for an evil as great in criminal as in civil cases and the consequences of which may be even more serious We are of opinion that these assignments of error are not well taken904 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb A careful perusal of the instructions satisfies us that they fairly submitted to the jury the principles of law by which they should be governed in the consideration of the evidence It would be im possible to prepare instructions to which an ingenious critic might not present plausible objection The definition of reasonable doubt is attempted by the court It is a difficult if not an impos sible task so to define it as to satisfy a subtle and metaphysical mind bent upon the detection of some point however attenuated upon which to hang a criticism But no unbiased person can read these instructions without having the conviction forced upon him that every safeguard which the benignity of the law throws around a prisoner upon trial was accorded to the petitioner in the case Two instructions asked for by the petitioner were refused by the court one of which undertakes to define reasonable doubt as fol lows The court instructs the jury that by reasonable doubt is meant such doubt as would cause a man of average prudence to hesitate about a matter of his own of like importance to himself as the case on trial is to the accused It would have been impossible for the jury to make any practical application of the proposition sought to be formulated in this in struction There could be no case of importance to a man such as the case on trial was to the accused unless he himself stood upon his deliverance before a jury charged with a capital offense But the instruction was properly refused upon the further ground that the instructions of the court upon the subject of rea sonable doubt were ample and correct guides to the jury upon that branch of the case The court was asked to instruct the jury that under the hu mane policy of the law of this State it is considered infinitely bet ter that ninety and nine that is an indefinite number of guilty persons should escape punishinent than that one innocent person should be punished and therefore it is far better that the jurv should err in acquittal than err in convicting We have heard it said and it is sometimes stated in the opinions of courts that it is better that ninety and nine guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person should be punished We have no fault to find with the expression as a rhetorical phrase but as a guide to a jury in reaching a conclusion it is of no value That no guiltv men should escape is equially indisputable but it would1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTrH 905 hardly find a proper place in an instruction to a jury The object of courts and juries is to shield the innocent and to punish the guilty and in this case the jury were told that the accused was pre sumed to be innocent until his guilt was established by the Com monwealth beyond a reasonable doubt that this presumption of innocence goes with him through the entire case and applies at every stage thereof and that if after having heard all the evidence the jury have a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused upon the whole case or as to any fact essential to prove the charge made against him in the indictment it is their duty to give him the bene fit of the doubt and find him not guilty And further that if upon the whole evidence there is any reasonable hypothesis con sistent with the innocence of the accused they must find him not guilty that the failure of the evidence to disclose any other crim inal agent than the accused is not a circumstance which may be considered by the jury in determining whether or not he was guilty of the crime wherewith he is charged that he is presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established and he is not to be prejudiced by the inability of the Commonwealth to point to any other crim inal agent nor is he called upon to vindicate his own innocence by naming the guilty person It is also to be observed that the court was careful in instructing the jury as to the weight to be given to the evidence of contradic tory statements made by the witness William McCue and others The jury was warned that this evidence was admissible only to con tradict the witness and not to be taken as substantive proof of the facts related by the witness or in the terms of the statute that they were not to consider the evidence of such inconsistent state ments except for the purpose of contradicting the witness During the closing argument for the prosecution Captain Mi cajah Woods who had assisted the prosecution arose and in the presence of the jury said to the court With the gracious consent of the gentlemen on the other side and the Coimonwealths Attor ney I would like to make one statement not pertaining to the merits of this case but in view of the attack which may not have been so intended but which sounded to me ungenerous as an un generous attack made upon me by the distinguished gentleman and who has made so able a speech I desire to say that I refused a large fee in this case to prosecute906 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb Counsel for the prisoner objected to the statement and asked that the jury be discharged in view of that statement It appears in the bill of exceptions that counsel for the prisoner had in his argument criticised the position of Captain Woods in acting as prosecutor under the compulsion of public opinion of a man he admitted had been his friend for twenty years The right of the public prosecutor to have associated with him an attorney to assist in the prosecution is established law in this State and it is not a proper subject of animadversion He is as lawfully there to assist the prosecution as counsel for the defense to defend the prisoner and so long as he keeps within proper bounds he is not open to criticism before the jury It would be a strange thing if counsel for the accused were permitted to criticise opposing counsel and that the latter should be obliged to submit in silence under the penalty we are asked to impose in this case There is no merit in this exception The jury having rendered a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree the accused moved to set aside the verdict among other reasons because the jury were permitted during the progress of the trial to read and did read certain newspapers containing refer ences to and comments upon the case pending the trial of the same It appears that before the jury was sworn and in response to a request from one of the jurors the court stated to the members of the jury that they might be permitted to read such portions of the daily newspapers as in no way related to this trial but that they must scrupulously avoid any parts of said papers as had any refer ence to this trial which the said members of the jury then and there severally promised to do And the sergeants were then instructed to carry out this instruction of the court At the tiine this instruc tion was given neither the prisoner or his counsel they being pres ent made objection though they were not asked by the court if they had objection In Iulnter v State 43 Ga 483 after some of the jury were in the box but the whole not impaneled and in the presence of the court those sworn were seen by counsel for accused reading a news paper which contained an article reflecting upon the counsel for prisoner and no motion or notice was then taken in regard thereto It was held that this was not such irregularity upon the part of the jurv as would be sufficient to set aside the verdict and that such1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 907 acts transpiring in the courtroom and in the presence of the court and of counsel when not objected to will not be favorably regarded after the verdict In Bulliner v People 95 Ill 394 counsel for a defendant hand ed a juror a newspaper to read after he was sworn but before the panel was filled and afterwards on the trial his attention was called to the fact that another juror was reading a newspaper in which was an article purporting to contain a report of the trial and commenting upon the case unfavorably to the defendant and made no objection thereto but stated privately to the court that it was best to say nothing about the matter as it might give the article undue prominence and do the defendant more harm than good it not appearing that the prosecution was responsible for the act It was held that the irregularity was waived and could not be urged by the defendant as error to reverse a judgment of conviction and that a prisoner on trial has no right to stand by and suffer irregular proceedings to take place and then seek a reversal for the same Like any other defendant if he neglects in proper time to insist upon his rights he waives them In McKinney v People 2 Gilm 556 it is said A prisoner on trial under our laws has no right to stand by and suffer irregular proceedings to take place and then ask to have the proceedings re versed on error on account of such irregularities The law by fur nishing him with counsel to defend him has placed him on the same platform with all other defendants and if he neglects in proper time to insist upon his rights he waives them So it is uniformly held in civil as well as in criminal cases for as we have already remarked the mode of procedure is substantial ly the same in both A party who stands by without objection and sees proper evidence excluded or improper evidence admitted with out objecting will not be heard to make the objection after verdict And so with instructions In other words litigants are not per mitted to play fast and loose with the court If they are silent when it is their duty to speak they are not permitted to speak when it is their duty to be silent The case under consideration is far stronger than those cited The court in the presence of the prisoner and of his counsel at the instance of the jury permitted them to have access to newspapers under rules which it presciibed Tt dloes not appear that the limits908 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb inmposed by the court were exceeded or that the prisoner was preju diced by what occurred But however that may be he had no right to sit mute prepared to abide by the results if they were favorable or to make objection if they were adverse We think it is the safer and better practice to exclude newspapers from the jury They are called upon to exercise the most sacred duty which can devolve upon a citizen and in its discharge they must make such personal sacrifice as is necessary to its due per formance but under the circumstances of this case no reversible error is disclosed in this respect No one can read the petitions for a writ of error in this case with out being satisfied that the accused had every advantage that could accrue to him from the efforts of able and astute counsel But no one can read the facts presented in evidence without being convinced that no advocacy however skilled to make the worse appear the better reason could have brought about any other result than that which has been reached The evidence precludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence and points with unerring certainty to the guilty man The record discloses a homicide remarkable only for its atrocity that it was committed by a member of the profession of the law who had been entrusted by his fellowcitizens with a responsible office and that the victim was his wife We have gone through the record and discussed what seemed to us to be its more important features There are exceptions to which we have not adverted Some of them we deemed unimpor tant others as controlled by principles well established or covered by what we have said with reference to kindred exceptions and there is but one other view which we are called upon to present Running through the petitions and more particularly the supple nental petition there is a subtle suggestion that this court has introduced a practice which tends to undermine the rights and abridge the privileges of those who stand accused of crime The theory propounded seems to be that a writ of error to the judgment of a trial court is one of the rights of a person convicted of crime while the truth is that a review by an appellate tribunal whether upon an appeal or writ of error is no part of due process of law Trhe inalienable rights of a person accused of crime are thus stated in the Bill of Rights That in all capital or criminal pros1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 909 ecutions a man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses to call for evidence in his favor and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage without whose unanimous consent he cannot be found guilty nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself that no man be deprived of his liberty except by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers Our statute prescribes the rule which controls the action of this court With reference to appeals and writs of error sec 3466 says In a case wherein the court shall deem the judgment decree or order complained of plainly right and reject it on that ground and the order of rejection so states no other petition therein shall afterwards be entertained We have no such practice as an absolute right of appeal in civil or criminal cases But the law requires a petition accompanied by a transcript of the record to be presented to the court or one of its judges whose duty it is to examine the errors assigned and to grant or refuse a writ as may deem proper It is as much the duty of the court or judge to deny the petition when of opinion that the decision complained of is plainly right as it is to grant it when any doubt exists as to the propriety of the decision The statute in its present form is found in the Code of 1849 Just when it took its place in the statute law we are not informed but the uniform practice of this court and of the General Court its prede cessor as an appellate tribunal in crinminal cases has been in ac cordance with the letter and spirit of that statute In 2 Va Cas 162 Vance v Commonwealth a case of homicide which ended in a conviction of murder

APPLY TO A PERSON ATTENDING AS A WITNESS IN A CRIMINAL CASE AS WELL AS TO A PERSON ATTENDING AS A WITNESS IN A CIVIL CASE IT IS MANIFEST THEN BOTH FROM THE HISTORY OF SEC 3351 AND FROM ITS ARRANGEMENT CLASSIFICATION OR COLLOCATION IN THE CODE THAT IT WAS NEVER INTENDED OR CONSIDERED TO BE APPLICABLE TO CRIMINAL CASES INDEED THE NECESSARY IMPORT OF ITS VERY LANGUAGE RESTRICTS IT TO CIVIL CASES A PARTY CALLED TO TESTIFY FOR ANOTHERTHE COMMONWEALTH HAS NO RIGHT OF COURSE TO CALL AN ACCUSED PERSON TO TESTIFY ON HER BEHALF AND AGAINST HIMSELF WHILE EQUALLY OF COURSE THAT ENTITY KNOWN AS THE COMMONWEALTH IS INCAPABLE OF BEING A WITNESS THE LEGISLATURE HAVING AMENDED SEC 3351 WITHOUT EXPRESSLY APPLYING ITS PROVISIONS TO CRIMINAL CASES IT CANNOT BE ASSUMED THAT IT MEANT TO EXTEND THE OPERATION OF THE SECTION AMENDED TO CASES TO WHICH IT DID NOT APPLY BEFORE IF THE LEGISLATURE MEANT TO CHANGE THE LAW IN RESPECT TO CRIMINAL CASES IT WOOULD HARDLY HAVE SOUGHT TO DO SO BY AMENDING A STATUTE APPLI CABLE IN THE NATURE OF THINGS TO CIVIL CASES ONLY WITHOUT INDICATING A PURPOSE TO EXTEND IT TO CRIMINAL CASES ANDERSONS CASE 100 VA 860 IS IN POINT SEE 3385 OF THE CODE IN REFERENCE TO

AUTHORITY OF WHICH THE LEARNED JUDGE OF THE TRIAL COURT ADMITTED THE EVIDENCE IN QUESTION DOES NOT APPLY TO CRIMINAL CASES IT WILL BE MORE LOGICAL BEFORE DISCUSSING WHETHER OR NOT THE COMMON WEALTH WAS PERMITTED TO EXCEED THE LIMITS CONTEMPLATED BY THE STATUTE SUPPOSING IT TO APPLY TO CRIMINAL CASESTO INQUIRE WHAT THE LAW IS IN RESPECT TO THE CROSSEXAMINATION AND IMPEACHMENT OF ONES OWN WITNESSES INDEPENDENTLY OF STATUTE COULD THE COMMONWEALTH INDEPENDENTLY OF STATUTE CROSSEXATMINE AND IMPEACH A WTITNESS INTRODUCED BY HER AFTER A CAREFUL INVESTIGATION OF THE AUTHORITIES BY HIS COUNSEL PETITIONER IS CONSTRAINED TO CONCEDE THAT WHERE A PARTY IS TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY THE UNEXPECTED AND UNFAVORABLE TESTIMONY OF A WITNESS INTRODUCED BY HIM SUCH PARTY MAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING THE RECOLLECTION OF THE WIT NESS AND INDUCING HIM TO CORRECT HIS TESTIMONY OR EXPLAIN ITS INCONSISTENCY ASK HIM IF HE DID NOT ON ANOTHER SPECIFIED OCCASION MAKE A STATEMENT IN CONSISTENT WITH HIS PRESENT STATEMENTPROVIDED THE STATEMENT BE OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE BUT PETITIONER INSISTS ON THE OTHER HAND THAT IF THE WITNESS ON BEING ASKED WHETHER OR NOT HE PREVIOUSLY MADE A STATEMENT CONTRADIC TORY OF THE ONE MADE ON THE STAND DENIES HAVING DONE SO THE PARTY PRO DUCING HIM MAY NOT INTRODUCE OTHER WITNESSES TO PROVE SUCH CONTRADICTORY STATEMENT OF THE WITNESS ON THIS POINT PETITIONER SHALL PURSUE THE SAME POLICY WHICH HE HAS PUR SUED THROUGHOUT THIS PETITION NAMELY THAT OF CITING A FEW WELL CONSIDERED CASES DECIDED BY APPELLATE COURTS OF THE HIGHEST RESPECTABILITY AND DECISIVE OF THE VERY QUESTION IN HAND IN THE FIRST PLACE THEN PETITIONER IS UNABLE TO FIND THAT THIS QUESTION HAS EVER BEEN RAISED OR DECIDED IN VIRGINIA BUT THE VERY FACT THAT A STATUTE HAS BEEN PASSED PERMITTING A PARTY TO PROVE CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS OF HIS OWN WITNESS IN CIVIL CASES SHOWS THAT BUT FOR THE STATUTE THE THING1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 871 COULD NOT BE DONE WHILE THE FOLLOWING CASES DECIDED BY THE APPELLATE COURTS OF OTHER STATES WOULD SEEM TO BE CONCLUSIVE COA V EAYRES 55 VERMONT 24 45 AMER REP 583 IN THIS CASE THE SOLE QUESTION WAS WHETHER A PARTY MIGHT SHOW THAT HIS OWN WITNESS HAD MADE STATEMENTS OUT OF COURT CONTRADICTORY OF HIS TESTI MONY IN COURT AND THE SYLLABUS OF THE CASE AS REPORTED IN THE AMERICAN REPORTS CONTAINS BUT A SINGLE POINT AS FOLLOWS A PARTY MAY NOT SHOW THAT HIS OWN WITNESS HAD MADE STATEMENTS CON TRADICTORY OF HIS TESTIMONY AIN EXAMINATION OF THE CASE WILL SHOW THAT A NUMBER OF TEXTBOOKS AND DECISIONS BOTH IN THIS COUNTRY AND ENGLAND WERE CRITICALLY EXAMINED BY THE COURT WITH THE RESULT THAT IT REACHED THE UNANIMOUS CONCLUSION STATED IN THE SYLLABUS AMONG THE TEXTWRITERS REFERRED TO ARE BULLER BEST WHARTON GREENLEAF AND REDFIELD AND BESIDES NUMEROUS ENGLISH CASES THE FOLLOWING AMERICAN CASES ARE CITED IN SUPPORT OF THE CONCLUSION REACHED BY THE COURT NAMELY ELLICOTT V PEARL 10 PETERS 432 SUPREME COURT OF U S BULLACRD V PEARSALL 53 N Y 230 COULTER V EXPRESS CO 56 N Y 585 POLLOCK V POLLOCK 71 N Y 137 ADAMS V WHEELER 97 MASS 67 THE VIEW EXPRESSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF VERMONT WAS THAT THE PLAIN TIFF IN THAT CASE WAS PROPERLY ALLOWED TO ASK THE WITNESS HIMSELF CONCERNING PREVIOUS STATEMENTS BUT THAT IT WAS ERROR TO ALLOW THE PLAINTIFF TO SHOW BY OTHER WITNESSES PRIOR CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS MADE BY THE WITNESS SUCH EVIDENCE SAYS THE COURT HAS NO OTHER EFFECT THAN TO DISCREDIT THE WITNESS AND TO SHOW HIM TO BE UNWORTHY OF BELIEF AND WE PREFER TO ADHERE TO WHAT WE DEEM TO BE THE WELL SETTLED RULE OF THE COMMON LAW ON THIS SUBJECT AND LEAVE IT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DIFFRENT RULE SHALL PREVAIL RATHER THAN FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THOSE WHO WOULD DISREGARD THE RULE AS NOT FOUNDED IN REASON JUDGE REDFIELD IS CITED BY THE COURT IN ITS OPINION AS HOLDING THAT THE PARTY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INQUIRE OF THE WITNESS AS TO HIS PRIOR CONTRADIC TORY STATEMENTS AND THIS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOWING THE WITNESS THAT HE IS IN ERROR AND GETTING HIM TO CORRECT HIMSELF BUT THAT IT WOULD BE GOING TOO FAR TO ALLOW A PARTY TO SHOW THAT THE TESTIMONY OF HIS WITNESS IS CON TRADICTORY OF STATEMENTS MADE BY HIM OUT OF COURT ON THE EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESS PREPARATORV TO THE TRIAL IN HU4RLEY V STATE OF OHIO 46 OHIO STATE REP 320 4 L R A 161 THE QUESTION WAS LABORIOUSLY EXAMINED BY THE SUPREME

HIM IN RESPECT TO DECLARATIONS AND STATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY MADE BY HIM WHICH ARE INCONSISTENT WITH HIS TESTIMONY FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING HIS RECOLLECTION AND IN DUCING HIM TO CORRECT HIS TESTIMONY OR EXPLAIN HIS APPARENT INCONSISTENCY872 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB AND FOR SUCH PURPOSE HIS PREVIOUS DECLARATIONS MAY BE REPEATED TO HIM AND HE MAY BE CALLED UPON TO SAY WHETHER THEY WERE MADE BY HIM 2 IN CASE THE WITNESS DENIES HAVING MADE SUCH STATEMENTS OR HIS ANSWER IS AMBIGUOUS CONCERNING THELN IT IS NOT COMPETENT FOR THE PARTY CALLING HIM TO PROVE THEM BY OTHER WITNESSES FROM THE OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILLIAMS J WE MAKE THE FOLLOWING QUOTATION AND IN RYERSON V ABINGTON 102 MASS 526 GRAY J AFTER QUOTING THE STATUTE PROCEEDS AS FOLLOWS SO GREAT A CHANGE IN THE RULES OF EVIDENCE GIVING SO EXTENSIVE A POWER TO A PARTY TO INTRODUCE PROOF IN CONTRADICTION AND DISPARAGEMENT OF A WITNESS PUT ON THE STAND BY HIMSELF UNCONTROLLED BY THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE BEFORE WHOM THE TRIAL IS HAD MUST BE KEPT STRICTLY WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STATUTE AND AGAIN STATUITES SIMILAR IN THEIR PROVISIONS TO THE ENGLISH COMMON LAW PRO CEDURE ACT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY MASSACHUSETTS KENTUCKY GEORGIA AND SOME OF THE OTHER STATES THE ENACTMENT OF SUCH STATUTES IS ITSELF A RECOG NITION OF THE NECESSITY OF A RESORT TO LEGISLATION TO ACCOMPLISH A CHANGE IN THE RULE THEREBY AFFECTED AND HAS BEEN SO REGARDED BY THE COURTS OF THE STATES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND STILL AGAININ ANSWERING THE ARGUMENT THAT A PARTY MIGHT BE SACRI FICED BY THE CONTRIVANCES OF AN ARTFUL WITNESSTHE COURT SAID THIS IS BUT AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF A PARTYS RIGHT TO IMPEACH HIS OWN WITNESS FOR IT MUST BE CONSIDERED THAT NO OTHER LEGITIMATE EFFECT COULD BE CLAIMED FROM THE PROOF OF THE CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS THAN THAT OF NEUTRALIZING HOSTILE TESTIMONY BY CASTING DISCREDIT ON THE WITNESS YET WHILE THIS IS ITS ONLY LEGITIMATE EFFECT THE DANGER OF SACRIFICING ONE PARTY BY ADMITTING IT IS NOT LESS THAN THAT OF SACRIFICING ANOTHER BY EXCLUDING IT IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES TO BE APPREHEND ED FROM PERMITTING THE FORMER STATEMENTS OF THE WITNESS IN CONTRADICTION OF HIS TESTIMONY ON THE TRIAL TO BE PROVEN BY THE PARTV CALLING HIM MAY BE QUITE AS SERIOUS AND THE APPREHENSION AS WELL GROUNDED AS ANY LIKELY TO RE SULT FROM ADHERING TO THE RULE AS NOW ESTABLISHED A PERSON MIGHT FROM MO TIVES OF SPITE OR REVENGE MAKE STATEMENTS AGAINST THE ACCUSED IN A CRIMINAL CASE WHICH IF TRUE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO CONVICT FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAVING THEM COMMUNICATED TO THE PROSECUTOR AND THUS PROCURING HIMSELF TO BE CALLED AS A WITNESS AND EVEN IF WHEN PUT UPON HIS OATH AT THE TRIAL HE TESTIFIES TRULY THAT HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE CASE AND THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY WERE THEN ALLOWED TO PROVE A FORMER STATEMENT OF THE WITNESS THE JURY MIGHT GIVE THEM SUCH WEIGHT AS WOULD TURN THE SCALE IN A DOUBTFUL CASE AND THE REVENGE OF THE WITNESS WOULD BE GRATIFIED THEN A PARTY MIGHT OPERATE UPON A WITNESS BY INDUCING HIM TO MAKE STATEMENTS IN HIS FAVOR WHEN NOT UNDER OATH FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANUFAC TURING EVIDENCE IN HIS BEHALF AND IF WHEN EXAMINED BY HIM THE WITNESS SHOULD FEEL THE OBLIGATION OF HIS OATH AND ABANDON HIS PURPOSE TO TESTIFY FALSELY OR BE OBLIGED TO DO SO UNDER CROSSEXAMINATION THE PARTY WHO OPERATED UPOIN HIM WOULD BE PREPARED TO DESTROY HIS CREDIBILITY BY PROOFS1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 873 OF THE FALSE STATEMENTS HE PROCURED HIM TO MAKE AND THUS NOT ONLY PREVENT HIS BEING INJURIOUS WHEN HE COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT BE USEFUL BUT HAVE WHATEVER ADVANTAGE SUCH STATEMENTS MIGHT GIVE HIM TO THE JURY THE RULE THAT A PARTY CANNOT DISCREDIT HIS OWN WITNESS BY PROVING THAT HE HAD MADE STATEMENTS AT OTHER TIMES INCONSISTENT WITH HIS TESTIMONY ON THE TRIAL IS THE RESULT OF LONG EXPERIENCE AND HAS BEEN STEADILY ADHERED TO BY THE COURTS OF THIS COUNTRY AND ENGLAND THAT THE RULE HAS GENERALLY OPERATED FAVORABLY IN JUDICIAL INVESTIGATIONS CAN HARDLY BE QUESTIONED IF IT BE SAID IT HAS NOT HAD THAT EFFECT IN EVERY INSTANCE AS MUCH MIGHT BE SAID OF MANY WELL ESTABLISHED RULES OF LAW AND THE GENERAL GOOD RESULT IS TO BE REGARDED RATHER THAN THE PARTICULAR INCONVENIENCE AND IT MIGHT WELL BE DOUBTED WHETHER IT IS NOT A SOUNDER RULE THAN THAT ADOPTED BY SOME STATUTES WHICH LEAVE IT WITHIN THE UNREGULATED DISCRETION OF EACH JUDGE TO ADMIT SUCH AND ONLY SUCH TESTIMONY AS MAY SEEM TO HIM EXPEDIENT PETITIONER HUMBLY SUBMITS THAT THE VIEWS SO WELL EXPRESSED IN THE OPIN ION JUST QUOTED SHOULD COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE COURT IN THE CASE NOW BEFORE IT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT PETITIONERS YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED BOY FOUND HIMSELF SOON AFTER THE TRAGEDY NOT ONLY IN THE VORTEX OF A PUBLIC SENTIMENT EXTREMELY ADVERSE TO PETITIONER BUT ALSO UNDER THE ESPIONAGE AND SURVEILLANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DETECTIVES WHO UNDERTOOK TO MAKE HIM A WITNESS AGAINST HIS FATHER TRHAT THE BOY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE AT FIRST TO STEM THE TORRENT AND WITHSTAND THE INFLUENCES AND BLANDISHMENTS BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON HIMN CAN BE WELL IMAGINED THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO BE LIEVE FOR A MOMENT IN THE GUILT OF HIS FATHER AND EVEN TO HAVE LENT HIMSELF FOR A WHILE TO HIS FATHERS ACCUSERS IS IN VIEW OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES NEITHER INCREDIBLE NOR ALTOGETHER UNNATURAL NEITHER IS IT UNBELIEVABLE AS SUGGEST ED BY THE LEARNED JUDGE IN THE OPINION JUST QUOTED THAT SOME ONE MIGHT HAVE OPERATED UPON THE WITNESS TO INDUCE HIM TO MAKE STATEMENTS OUT OF COURT FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OF MANUFACTURING EVIDENCE IN BEHALF OF THE COM MONWEALTH BELIEVING THAT EVEN IF THE WITNESS WHEN PUT TO THE TEST OF AN OATH SHOULD ABANDON THE STATEMENTS HE HAD BEEN INDUCED TO MAKE THEY MIGHT NEVERTHELESS BE GOTTEN BEFORE THE JURY AND THE COURT UNDER THE PRE TEXT OF IMPEACHING THE WITNESS EVEN IF THE STATUTE WERE APPLICABLE TO CRIMININAL PROSECUTIONS NO WARRANT COULD BE FOUND THEREIN FOR THE LENGTH TO WHICH THE COMMONWEALTH WAS PERMITTED TO GO IN THIS CASE IN THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE WITNESS WIL LIAM MCCUE BUT PETITIONER CONFIDENTLY SUBMITS THAT INDEPENDENTLY OF THE QUESTION WHETHER THE STATUTE APPLIES TO CRIMINAL CASES AND OF THE QUESTION WHETHER A PARTY COULD BUT FOR THE STATUTE IMPEACH HIS OWN WITNESS BY PROVING CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS MADE BY HIM OUT OF COURT THE COMMONWEALTH WAS PERMITTED IN PETITIONERS CASE TO GO FAR BEYOND THE LIMITS CONTEMPLATED BY THE STATUTE OR OTHERWISE LEGITIMATE THE STATUTE PROVIDES THAT A PARTY PRODUCING A WITNESS MAY IN CASE THE WITNESS SHALL IN THE OPINION OF THE COURT PROVE ADVERSE CONTRADICT HIM BY OTHER EVIDENCE OR BY LEAVE OF THE COURT PROVE THAT HE HAS MADE AT OTHER874 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB TIMES A STATEMENT INCONSISTENT WITH HIS PRESENT TESTIMONY AS ALREADY POINTED OUT THE WITNESS HAD GIVEN MANY TYPEWRITTEN PAGES OF TESTIMONY BEFORE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMONWEALTH SOUGHT TO IMPEACHL HIM OR TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR HIS IMPEACHMENT BY REFERENCE TO THE TESTIMONY IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE ONLY QUESTION AS TO WHICH THE WITNESS HAD PROVED ADVERSE TUP TO THE TIME WHEN THE REPRESEN TATIVES OF THE COMMONWEALTH SOUGHT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR CONTRADICTING HIM WAS WHEN HE ANSWERED THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AT THE SUPPER TABLE ON THE EVENING OF THE HOMICIDE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMONWEALTH CLAIMED THAT WHEN THE WITNESS TESTI FIED THAT THERE WAS NO DISAGREEMENT OR UNPLEASANTNESS BETWEEN HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AT THE SUPPER TABLE THEY EXPECTED AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ANSWSER FROM HIM IF AS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMIIONWEALTH CLAIMED THEY WERE SURPRISLED ASTONISHED OR ASTOUNDED AT THE ANSWER OF THE WITNESS AS TO WHAT TRANSPIRED AT THE SUPPER TABLE THEY CERTAINLY HAD NO RIGHT TO BE SURPRISED THAT THE WITNESS SHOULD HAVE ANSWERED UNFAVORABLY ANY OTHER QUESTION PROPOUNDED TO HIM ON BEHALF OF THE COMMONWEALTH THE GROUND UPON WHICH THE RIGHT OF A PARTY TO PROVE THAT HIS WITNESS HAS MADE A STATE MENT INCONSISTENT WITH HIS TESTIMONY RESTS IS THAT THE PARTY PRODUCING HINM IS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND MAY BE PREJUDICED BY THE TESTIMONY OF A WITNESS WHOM HE HAS HELD OUT AS CREDIBLE IT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT IF THE PARTY PRODUCING A WITNESS KNOWS OR HAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HIS TESTIMONY WILL BE ADVERSE OR UNFAVORABLE HE CANNOT CONTRADICT HIM THIS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS SO THEN IN THIS CASE WHILE THE COMMONWEALTH WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT SUPPOSING THE STATUTE TO APPLY TO PROVE A CONTRADICTORY STATEMENT MADE BY THE WITNESS AS TO WHAT TRANSPIRED AT THE SUPPER TABLEHIS ANSWER BEING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT SHE HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECTSHE WOULDT HAVE NO RIGHT TO CONTRADICT THE WITNESS IN RESPECT TO ANY OTHER SUBSEQUENT QUESTION ASKED BY THE COMMONWEALTH AND ELICITING AN UNFAVORABLE ANSWER FOR THE REASON THAT IT HAD BECOME APPAZRENT FROMB THE ANTSWER ALREADY GIVEN THAT THE WITNESS WAS AN ADVERSE WITNESS CERTAINLY AFTER HAVING RECEIVED AN UNFAVORABLE ANSWER FROM THE WITNESS IN RESPECT TO THE OCCURRENCES AT THE SUPPER TABLE WHEN THEY HAD THE RIGHT TO EXPECT AND DID EXPECT A FAVORABLE ONE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMONWEALTH WERE PUT UPON FAIR NOTICE THAT THE WITNESS WAS ADVERSE AND NOT

COMMONWEALTH HAD BEEN LED TO EXPECT THEY SHOULD LIAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER AND ASK THE WITNESS ONTE MORE QUTESTION CALCULATED TO DEVELOP HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE PROSECUTION BUT TO HOLD THAT AFTER BEING FULLY SATISFIED THAT THE WITNESS WAS UNCOMIPROMISINGLY ADVERSE THEI COMMONWEALTH MIGHT NEVERTHELESS PROCEED TO ASK THE WITNESS A SCORE OF QUESTIONS KIIOWINQ THAT THE ANSWERS WOULD BE UNFAVORABLE AND MIGHT THEN CONTRADICT THE WITNESS BY SHOWING BY OTHER WITNESSES THAT HE HAD INALE INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS AND WHAT THE INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS WERE WAS CARRYING THE LOCTRINE

MUST BE KEPT STRICTLY876 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STATUTE WHEN WE COME TO CONSIDER THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE IT WOULD SEEM PLAIN THAT IT NEVER WAS MEANT OR INTENDED THAT THE PARTY PRODUCING A WITNESS MIGHT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PROVE THE CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS THEMSELVES BUT ONLY THE FACT THAT THE WITNESS HAS MADE A STATEMENT INCONSISTENT WITH HIS PRESENT TESTIMONY THE STATUTE IN TERMS PERMITS THE PARTY TO PROVE THE FACT THAT HIS WITNESS HAD MADE AN INCONSISTENT STATEMENT BUT IT DOES NOT PERMIT THE PARTY TO PROVE WHAT THE STATEMENT WAS THIS CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATUTE IS MADE PLAIN BY THE FOLLOWING PROVISION FOR LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR SUCH PROOF BEFORE PROOF CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE WITNESS HAS MADE AN INCONSISTENT STATEMENT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SUPPOSED STATEMENT SUFFICIENT TO DESIGNATE THE PARTICU LAR OCCASION MUST BE MENTIONED TO THE WITNESS THE STATUTE DOES NOT SAY THAT THE SUPPOSED STATEMENT ITSELF MAY BE MENTIONED TO THE WITNESS BUT ONLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEREOF SUFFICIENT TO DESIGNATE THE OCCASION IT WOULD SEEM THEREFORE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY CAREFUL NOT TO PROVIDE THAT ANY STATEMENT OF A WITNESS MADE OUT OF COURT MIGHT BE DETAILED IN TOTIDEM VERBIS TO THE JURY BUT ONLY THAT AFTER ASKING THE ADVERSE WITNESS WHETHER OR NOT HE MADE ON A DESIGNATED OCCASION A STATEMENT INCONSISTENT WITH HIS PRESENT

FOUNDATION TO IM PEACH HIM WWM MCCUE BY BALDWIN WM MCCUE TESTIFIED AS ALREADY POINTED OUT THAT THE STATEMENT WAS NOT ONLY NOT WRITTEN DOWN IN THE PRESENCE OF OR SIGNED BY JOHN PERRY BUT THAT WHEN HE WM MCCUE READ IT TO JOHN PERRY HE DENIED THAT IT CONTAINED THE TRUTH SO THEN WE HAVE A PAPER CONTAINING MATTER MOST INCULPATORY OF PETITIONER WRITTEN OUT BY ONE WITNESS IMPEACHED BY THE COMMONWEALTH AS THE STATEMENT OF AN OTHER WITNESS IMPEACHED BY THE COMMONWEALTH AND REPUDIATED AND DENIED BY BOTH THAT THE STATEMENT SO FAR AS PETITIONER WAS CONCERNED WAS THE VERIEST HEARSAY CANNOT BE GAINSAID THE TRIAL COURT ADMITTED THE PAPER FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCREDITING THE WITNESS JOHN PERRY THAT IS TO SAY PERMITTED THIS WITNESS WHOSE STATE MENT ON THE STAND WAS MOST FAVORABLE TO PETITIONER TO BE IMPEACHED BY A PAPER HE DID NOT WRITE WHICH WAS NOT WRITTEN IN HIS PRESENCE AND WHICH BY THE UNCONTROVERTED EVIDENCE HE PROMPTLY REPUDIATED AND REFUSED TO SIGN WHEN SHOWN TO HIM THE STATEMENT OF THE PROPOSITION IS SUFFICIENT COMMENT WOULD BE SUPERFLUOUS BILL OF EXCEPTIONS NO 44THE FORTYFOURTH EXCEPTION RELATES TO A STATE MENT MADE BY CAPT MICAJAH WOODS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY AFTER THE CLOSING ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER HAD BEEN CONCLUDED IN WHICH STATE MENT CAPT WOODS SAID THAT HE HAD REFUSED A LARGE FEE TO PROSECUTE PETITIONER IT APPEARS THAT CAPT WOODS IN THE COURSE OF HIS OPENING ARGAMENT BEFORE1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 881 THE JURY STATED THAT PETITIONER HAD BEEN HIS FRIEND FOR TWENTY YEARS IN REPLY ING TO WHICH COUNSEL FOR PETITIONER HAD ANIMADVERTED UPON THIS UTTERANCE BY CAPT WOODS IT WAS IN ANSWER TO THIS ANIMADVERSION IT SEEMS THAT CAPT WOODS WHO HAD SPOKEN BEFORE THE COUNSEL FOR PETITIONER SPOKE AROSE IN THE BAR AND MADE THE STATEMENT IN QUESTION PETITIONER PETITIONER SUBMITS THAT THE STATEMENT WAS WHOLLY IMPROPER THE NECESSARY INFERENCE FROM IT WAS THAT PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN THE COMMUN ITY WAS SO ADVERSE TO PETITIONER AS TO CONSTRAIN CAPT WOODS TO PROSECUTE WITHOUT COMPENSATION HIS FRIEND OF TWENTY YEARS STANDING IF CAPT WOODS HAD MADE THAT STATEMENT OUT OF COURT TO ANY MEMBER OF THE JURY OR TO THE JURY AS A WHOLE AND THE MATTER HAD COME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COURT IT WOULD OR SHOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DISCHARGE OF THE JURY THAT THE IMPROPER STATEMENT WAS MADE IN COURT DOES NOT MATERIALLY ALTER THE MATTER SINCE THE COURT DID NOT DIRECT THE JURY TO DISREGARD IT INDEED THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE DISREGARDED THE STATEMENT IF THEY HAD BEEN TOLD THE EFFECT THEREFORE WAS THE SAME IT WAS AN UNWARRANTED STATE MENT CALCULATED TO IMPROPERLY INFLUENCE THE JURY CAPT WOODS HAD NO RIGHT TO POSE BEFORE THE JURY AS PROMPTED OR IMPELLED BY CONSIDERATIONS WHICH APPEALED UNFAIRLY TO THE JURY THE STATEMENT MADE BY HIM WAS NOT A MATTER WHICH THE COMMONVEALTH COULD HAVE GIVEN IN EVIDENCE OR WHICH THE JURY WERE ENTITLED TO KNOW NOR WAS IT JUSTIFIED BY THE CRITICISM OF CAPT WOODS FOR APPEARING AGAINST HIS FRIEND OF TWVENTY YEARS STANDING HE HAD NO RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO STATE AS HE DID STATE IN HIS ADDRESS TO THE JURY THAT HE HAD BEEN THE FRIEND OF PETITIONER FOR TWENTY YEARS THAT STATEMENT OF ITSELF WAS CALCULATED AND INTENDED TO UNJUSTLY PREJUDICE PETITIONER NO MAN HAS A RIGHT TO USE HIS FRIENDSHIP OR PRETENDED FRIEND SHIP FOR ANOTHER TO THE DISADVANTAGE AND UNDOING OF THAT OTHER AND SO WHEN CAPT WOODS UNDERTOOK TO THROW HIS PROFESSED LONG FRIENDSHIP FOR PETITIONER INTO THE SCALES AGAINST HIM HE TOOK AN UNJUST AND UNWARRANTED ADVANTAGE OF PETITIONER IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE A MORE INSIDIOUS INJURY OR WRONG TO A PERSON RESTING UNDER A SERIOUS CHARGE THAN HIS PROSE CUTOR POSING BEFORE THE JURY AS HIS FRIEND THE CONDUCT AND BEARING OF AN IMPARTIAL PERSON TOWARDS AND HIS STATEMENTS CONCERNING ANOTHER CHARGED WITH CRIME WILL ORDINARILY BE ACCORDED ONLY DUE WEIGHT BUT THE CONDUCT AND STATEMENTS OF ONE PROFESSING FRIENDSHIP OF LONG STANDING AND CLAIMING TO OCCUPY THE EXALTED ATTITUDE OF SACRIFICING

THE JUDGMENT OF THIS COURT ENTERED ON THE DAY AND DATE LAST AFORESAID REFUSING THE SAID WRIT THE PARTICULAR MATTER WHICH PETITIONER DESIRES NOW TO PRESS UPON THE CONSIDERATION OF THE COURT IS THAT THE ERRORS ASSIGNED BY HIM IN HIS ORIGINAL1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 883 PETITION ARE OF SUCH CHARACTER AS TO ENTITLE HIM AT LEAST TO A HEARING BY THIS HONORABLE COURT ALBEIT FROM SUCH EXAMINATION AND CONSIDERATION AS THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COURT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GIVE PETITIONERS CASE IN THE SHORT TIME AT THEIR DISPOSAL THEY MAY ENTERTAIN THE OPINION THAT THE JUDGMENB COMPLAINED OF IS RIGHT PETITIONER HUMBLY SUBMITS THAT THE RIGHT OF APPEAL TO THIS HONORABLE COURT WHERE HUMAN LIFE IS THE STAKE AND A FAIR OPPORTUNITY OF BEING HEARD AT ITS BAR BY COUNSEL IS ONE WHICH ACCORDING TO THE THEORY PRACTICE AND TRADITIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS COMMONWEALTH CAN BE ALMOST CLASSED AMONG THE ABSOLUTE RIGHTS OF MANKIND IF INDEED THE GROUNDS UPON WHICH SUCH RIGHT IS INVOKED BE FRIVOLOUS OR UNIMPORTANT OR BE SUCH AS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADJUDICATED AND SETTLED BY THIS COURT AFTER FULL ARGUMENT AGAINST THE CONTENTION OF THE APPELLANT THEN UNDOUBTEDLY SHOULD THIS COURT REFUSE TO ENTERTAIN THE APPEAL AND NOT SUFFER THE DIGNITY AND AUTHORITY OF THE COURT TO BE TRIFLED WITH BUT WHERE THE MATTER RELIED UPON IS MATERIAL TO THE CONDEMNED AND SUCH AS MAY HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT HIS CONDEMNATION AND WHERE THE CORRECTNESS AND REGULARITY OF THE JUDGMENT COMPLAINED OF IS IN GOOD FAITH CALLED IN QUESTION UPON POINTS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE TEST OF THE JUDI CIAL SCRUTINY OF THIS COURT AFTER FULL ARGUMENT AT ITS BAR AND WHICH DO IN FACT ENGAGE THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THE COURT AND THE PROFESSION AT LARGE REFUSAL TO HEAR ARGUMENT IS THE DENIAL OF A RIGHT WITHIN THE CONTEM PLATION OF THE LAW OF THE LAND THE UNQUESTIONED RIGHT OF AN ACCUSED PERSON TO THE BENEFIT OF COUNSEL IS PRACTICALLY DENIED IF THE COUNSEL BE SIMPLY PERMITTED TO ASSIGN ERROR IN A PETITION TO THE COURT AND HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER OR COMBAT THE REA SONS BY WHICH THE COURT IS INFLUENCED IN DECIDING ADVERSELY IT MAY BE THAT IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE COURT THE GROUNDS OF ITS DECISION ARE IMPREGNABLE BUT THE QUESTION IS WHEN HUMAN LIFE IS THE STAKE OUGHT THE COURT HOWEVER EMINENT IT BE AND HOWEVER OBSCURE THE COUNSEL TO CON CLUDE THE MATTER UNTIL ITS REASONS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE TEST OF A FAIR AND FULL OPPORTUNITY OF COMBATING THEM WHEN THE CASE PRESENTED IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT ASPECTS IS ONE OF FIRST IMPRESSION IN THIS COMMONWEALTH IT IS INMPOSSIBLE IN ANY SUCH CASE AS PETITIONERS FOR COUNSEL HOWEVER DILIGENT TO ANTICIPATE THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH WILL ARISE IN THE MINDS OF THE COURT INDEED MANY OF THE QUESTIONS FOR ADJUDICATION BEING NEW AND THE CASE ITSELF INVOLVING THE WEIGHTIEST CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE REALM OF HU IAN JURISDICTION PETITIONERS COUNSEL DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ATTEMNPT TO ANTICIPATE IN THEIR PRESENTATION OF THE CASE IN THE PETITION ALL THAT MIGHT BE URGED FROM THE ADVERSARY STANDPOINT THEY NATURALLY AND REASONABLV EXPECTED AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMBAT THE ADVERSE VIEW IN THE ARGIIIIMENT BEFORE THE COURT SEVERAL OF THE QUESTIONS AT LEAST ARE NEW AND HITHIERTO UNADJUDICATED IN THIS STATENOTABLY THE QUESTION AS TO THE JURY READING NEWSPAPERS AND THAT CONCERNING THE CONSTRUCTION AND SCOPE OF THE RECENT ANMEIDMENT OF SEC 3351 OF THE CODE IN REFERENCE TO A PARTY IMPEACH ING HIS OWVN WITNESS IN REGARD TO THE FIRST OF THESE IT HAS BEEN STATED IN THE PRESS THAT THE884 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTEET FEB GROUND UPON WHICH THIS COURT OVERRULED THE OBJECTION WAS THAT THE JURY ASKED PERMISSION OF THE COURT TO READ NEWSPAPERS AND PETITIONER DID NOT THEN OBJECT BE IT SO BUT 1 THE MATTER WAS NOT MENTIONED TO THE PETI TIONER OR HIS COUNSEL WHOSE VIEWS IN REGARD THERETO IT WAS NOT DEEMED MATERIAL TO CONSULT OR CONSIDER AND 2 IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE JURORS WERE PLEDGED NOT TO READ ANYTHING IN REFERENCE TO THIE CASE ON TRIAL WHERE AS IN FACT THEY OR SOME OF THEM DID DO SO BUT HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO THIS HONORABLE COURT HOW UNJUST IT WAS TO PLACE PETITIONER IN THE POSITION OF BEING CALLED UPON TO OBJECT OR BE CON CLUDED BY HIS SILENCE THE TRIAL WAS LIKELY TO LAST A MONTH THE JURORS WERE BROUGHT FROM THEIR HOMES AND TAKEN FROM THEIR BUSINESS AND WERE TO REMAIN IN SUBSTANTIAL CAPTIVITY FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIODCUT OFF FROM INTER COURSE WITH SOCIETY AND THE WORLD TO DENY THEM THE PRIVILEGE OF READING THE NEWSPAPERS WAS NOT A MATTER TO WHICH THEY WERE LIKELY TO SUBMIT KIND LY THEY WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY ESTEEM IT A HARDSHIP IF THEIR REQUEST WERE DENIED AND IN VIEW OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE NOT TO READ ANY THING ABOUT THE CASE WOULD HAVE REGARDED ANY OBJECTION AS A REFLECTION UPON THEIR INTEGRITY AS WELL PETITIONERS LIFE WAS IN THE HOLLOW OF THEIR HANDS IS IT NOT THEN A MONSTROUS PROPOSITION THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE COULD SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEALING WITH THIS MATTER FROM HIS OWN SHOULDERS TO THOSE OF PETITIONER IN REFERENCE TO THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE WITNESS INTRODUCED BY THE COM MONWEALTH IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE STATUTE CANNOT BE SO CONSTRUED AS TO ALLOW A PARTY GREATER LATITUDE IN IMPEACHING HIS OWN WITNESS THAN HE IS ALLOWED IN IMPEACHING THE WITNESS OF HIS ADVERSARY THIS COURT HAS HELD LANQG HORNE V COMMONWEALTH 76 VA 1019 THAT THE TEST WHETHER A STATEMENT BY A WITNESS INTRODUCED BY THE ADVERSARY MADE IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION PUT BY THE PARTY PROPOSING TO IMPEACH THE WITNESS CAN BE CONTRADICTED IS WHETHER THE PARTY OFFERING TO CONTRADICT COULD GIVE IN EVIDENCE THE CONTRA DICTORY MATTER IF THE WITNESS HAD NOT DENIED IT AND PETITIONERS COUNSEL IN THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THE SUBJECT HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED A SINGLE CASE HOLD ING THAT THE OPINION OF A WITNESS COULD BE PROVED IN ORDER TO CONTRADICT HIM EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF AN EXPERT WITNESS WHO HAVING GIVEN HIS EXPERT OPINION IN EVIDENCE MAY BE CONTRADICTED BY SHOWING THAT HE HAD EXPRESSED A CONTRADICTORY OPINION ELSEWHERE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MEANT TO MAKE THE MERE OPINION OF A WITNESS AS TO THE VERY FACT OF THE GUILT OF AN ACCUSED PERSON ADMISSIBLE IN ANY CASE IT IS EQUALLY IM POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT ADMISSION OF SUCH OPINION WAS HARMLESS DOES THIS COURT MEAN TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS HOLDING THAT IT IS PLAINLY RIGHT THAT A JUROR WHO SAYS HIMSELF THAT HE HAS MADE UP AND EXPRESSED A DE CIDED OPINION SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO THE PANEL THAT IT IS PLAINLY RIGHT TO ALLOW JURYMEN TO READ ADVERSE NEWSPAPER COMMENTS UPON THE CASE ON TRIAL THAT IT IS PLAINLY RIGHT THAT THE OPINION OF THE SON OF AN ACCUSED PERSON TOUCHING THE VERY FACT OF GUILT SHOULD BE GIVEN IN EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM AND WILL THIS COURT DENY THE ACCUSED THE POOR PRIVILEGE OF AN OPPOR TINITY OF TRYING TO DISSUADE YOU FROM THIS VIEW BY DEBATING THE MATTER WITH YOU AT YOUR BAR1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 885 THERE IS AN INSTANCE ON RECORD IN WHICH A JUDGMENTNOT RENDERED BY A HUMAN TRIBUNAL AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL BUT BY THE ALMIGHTY AGAINST A WHOLE PEOPLEWAS REVERSED UPON REARGUMENT SEE EXODUS XXXII 7 14 IS IT THEN TOO MUCH TO ASK OF THIS COURT THAT IT SO FAR RECONSIDER ITS JUDG MENT IN THIS CASE AS TO HEAR ARGUMENT OF IT DO NOT THE MEMBERS OF THIS COURT OWE IT INDEED TO THE COMMONWEALTH TO HEAR ARGUMEIHT BEFORE THEY PASS JUDGMENT UPON PETITIONER WHILE IT MAY SEEM INAPPOSITE IN ONE UNDER CONDEMNATION OF DEATH TO URGE UPON THE COURT CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE GENERAL WELFARE OF THE COMMONWEALTH WHOSE COURT OF LAST RESORT HAS ADJUDGED HIM UNWORTHY TO LIVE NEVERTHELESS HE IS ADVISED THAT HE IS ENTITLED TO SALVATION THOUGH IT MUST BE WORKED OUT THROUGH RIGHTS WHICH THOSE TO WHOM THEY APPERTAIN WOULD DISOWN AND DENY IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMON LAW THAT THE ADJUDICATION OF THE HIGHEST TRIBUNAL OR COURT OF LAST RESORT SHALL STAND AS RULES OF LAW IN ALL SIMILAR CASES THIS MAKES IT NECESSARY THAT ALL SUCH DECISIONS SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE AND EXAMINABLE BUT WHEN THE COURT DECLARES THE LAW ON IM PORTANT QUESTIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME BY REFUSING A WRIT OF ERROR THE PRIN CIPLES SO DECLARED ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE NO ONE CAN LAY HANDS UPON THEM THEY AFFORD NO GUIDE FOR THE FUATURE THEY VANISH AND MAKE NO SIGN BUT FAR WORSE THAN THAT THEY TEND TO THE EXERCISE OF IRRESPONSIBLE ARBITRARY POWER AND THIS IN TURN TO INJUSTICE AND TYRANNY THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THIS

LIBERTY AND PROPERTY ARE SECURE WHEN NO MAN CAN BE DEPRIVED OF EITHER EXCEPT IN THE DUE ORDERLY AND CUSTOMARY COURSE OF THE LAW OF THE LAND IN A TRIBUNAL WHICH OBSERVES THE LAWS FOR ITS REGULATION

ANY JUROR WAS NOT IMPARTIAL IF ANY EVIDENCE WAS NOT PROPER IF ANY JUROR READ ANYTHING IN A NEWSPAPER DURING THE TRIAL WHICH MAY HAVE INFLUENCED HIM OR PREJUDICED PETITIONER IN HIS ESTIMATION THEN PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO A NEW TRIAL NO MATTER IF THIS COURT DO THINK THERE WAS PROPER EVIDENCE SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH HIS GUILT BECAUSE THE LAW OF THE LAND DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE THE CONVICTION OF

AFORETHOUGHT IS GUILTY OF MURDER THAT A MURDER WHICH IS PERPETRATED BY POISON LYING IN WAIT OR ANY OTHER KIND OF WILFUL DELIBERATE AND PRE MEDITATED KILLING IS MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE 7 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES IS A QUES TION EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE JURY AND THE LAW IS THAT WHERE A NUMBER OF WITNESSES TESTIFY DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER THE JURY IS NOT BOUND TO REGARD THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE AS EQUALLY BALANCED THE JURY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DE TERMINE FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE WITNESSES ON THE STAND THEIR MANNER OF TESTIFYING AND THEIR APPARENT CANDOR AND FAIRNESS THEIR APPARENT INTEL LIGENCE OR LACK OF INTELLIGENCE AND FROMI ALL THE OTHER SURROUNDING CIRCUM STANCES APPEARING ON THE TRIAL WHICH WITNESSES ARE MORE WORTHY OF CREDIT AND TO GIVE

OFFENSE CHARGED REASONABLE DOUBT MUST BE BASED UPON THE EVIDENCE OR THAT IS SUGGESTED BY THE EVIDENCE OR GROWS OUT OF THE EVIDENCE ITSELF IT MUST NOT BE ARBITRARY DOUBT WITHOUT EVIDENCE TO SUSTAIN IT

ENTERTAIN SUCH DOUBTS AS ARE MERELY CHIMERICAL OR CONJECTURAL A DOUBT TO JUSTIFY AN ACQUITTAL MUST BE REASONABLE DOUBT AND IT MUST ARISE FROM A CANDID AND IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION OF ALL THE EVIDENCE

DELIBER ATE AND PREMEDITATED KILLING IT IS NOT NECESSARY THE INTENTION TO KILL SHOULD EXIST ANY PARTICULAR LENGTH OF TIME PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL KILLING IT IS ONLY NECESSARY THAT SUCH INTENTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE TIME OF KILLING OR ANY TIME PREVIOUSLY 12 THE COURT FURTHER INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT A MORTAL WOUND GIVEN WITH A DEADLY WEAPON IN THE PREVIOUS POSSESSION

BE USED IS TO ENABLE THE JURY TO JUDGE WHETLHER OR NOT THE WITNESS IS ENTITLED TO CREDIT 15 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT THE LAW PRESUMES EVERY PERSON CHARG ED WITH CRIME TO BE INNOCENT UNTIL HIS GUILT IS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMON WEALTH BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT AND THIS PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE GOES WITH THE ACCUSED THROUGH THE ENTIRE CASE AND APPLIES AT EVERY STAGE THEREOF AND IF AFTER HAVING HEARD ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE THE JURY HAVE A REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED UPON THE WHOLE CASE OR AS TO ANY FACT ESSENTIAL TO PROVE THE CHARGE NIADE AGAINST HIM IN THE

CHARGED IN THE INDICTMIENT BE RAISED BY THE EVIDENCE OR LACK OF EVIDENCE SUCH DOUBT IS DECISIVE AND THE JURY MUST ACQUIT THE ACCUSED SINCE A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY MEANS NO MORE THAN THAT THE GUILT OF

THEN THE JURY ARE INSTRUCTED THAT THE LAW PRESUMES PRIMA FACIE THAT SUCH KILLING WAS MURDER OF THE SECOND DEGREE AND THE BURDEN RESTS UPON THE COMMONWEALTH TO ELEVATE THE OFFENSE TO MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE BY PROV ING BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THAT CRIME AS DEFINED BY ANOTHER INSTRUCTION 21 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT ALL STATEMENTS WHICH THEY MAY BELIEVE FROM THE EVIDENCE WERE MADE BY WILLIAM MCCUE THE SON OF THE ACCUSED OR JOHN PERRY TO OTHER PERSONS NOT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ACCUSED CAN ONLY BE CONSIDERED BY THE JURY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCREDITING THE SAID WILLIAM MCCUE AND THE SAID JOHN PERRY AND THE JURY ARE INSTRUCTED THAT SUCH STATE MENT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED BY THEM AS EVIDENCE AGAINST THE ACCUSED BUT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE ABOVE STATED AND SAID STATEMENTS SHOULD IN CONSIDER ING THE QUESTION OF THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF THE ACCUSED BE WHOLLY DISRE GARDED BY THE JURY AND TREATED AS IF THEY HAD NEVER BEEN MADE 22 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT IF UPON THE WHOLE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE THERE IS ANY REASONABLE HYPOTHESIS CONSISTENT WITH THE INNOCENCE OF THE ACCUSED THEY MUST FIND HIM NOT GUILTY 23 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT UPON THE TRIAL OF A CRIMINAL CASE BY A JURY THE LAW CONTEMPLATES A CONCURRENCE OF TWELVE MINDS IN THE CONCLUSION OF GUILT BEFORE A CONVICTION CAN BE HAD NOT ONLY IS THIS TRUE WITH RESPECT TO THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED BUT IT IS LIKEWISE TRUE WITH RESPECT TO THE DEGREE OF THE CRIME THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE JURY MAY BELIEVE FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY OF THE KILLING OF THE DECEASED STILL IF ANY INDI VIDUAL MEMBER OF THE JURY AFTER HAVING DULY CONSIDERED ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE AND AFTER A CONSULTATION WITH HIS FELLOWJURORS SHOULD ENTER TAIN A REASONABLE DOUBT AS TO THE DEGREE OF GUILT OF THE ACCUSED IT IS HIS DUTY NOT TO SURRENDER HIS OWN CONVICTIONS AS TO SUCH DEGREE OF GUILT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE BALANCE OF THE JURY ENTERTAIN DIFFERENT CONVICTIONS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEGREE 24 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT THE FAILURE OF THE EVIDENCE TO DISCLOSE ANY OTHER CRIMINAL AGENT THAN THE ACCUSED IS NOT A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED BY THE JURY IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS GUILTY OF THE CRIME WHEREWVITH HE IS CHARGED THE PRISONER IS PRESUMED TO BE INNO CENT UNTIL HIS GUILT IS ESTABLISHED AND HE IS NOT TO BE PREJUDICED BY THE INABILITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH TO POINT ANY OTHER CRIMINAL AGENT NOR IS HE CALLED UPON TO VINDICATE HIS OWN INNOCENCE BY NAMING THE GUILTY PERSON 25 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT UPON THE TRIAL OF A CRIMINAL CASE BY A JURY THE LAW CONTEMPLATES THE CONCURRENCE OF TWELVE MINDS IN THE CONCLU SION OF GUILT BEFORE A CONVICTION CAN BE HAD EACH INDIVIDUAL JUROR MUST BE SATISFIED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE DEFENDANTS GUILT BEFORE HE CAN UINDER HIS OATLI CONSENT TO A VERDICT OF GUILTY EACH JUROR SHOULD FEEL890 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING UPON HIM AS A MEMBER OF THE JURY AND SHOULD REALIZE THAT HIS OWN MIND MUST BE CONVINCED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE DEFENDANTS GUILT BEFORE HE CAN CONSENT TO A VERDICT OF GUILTY THERE FORE IF ANY INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE JURY AFTER HAVING DULY CONSIDERED ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH HIS FELLOW JURORS SHOULD ENTERTAIN SUCH REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE DEFENDANTS GUILT AS IS SET FORTH IN CERTAIN OTHER INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS CASE IT IS HIS DUTY NOT TO SURRENDER HIS OWN CONVICTIONS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE BALANCE OF THE JURY ENTER TAIN DIFFERENT CONVICTIONS 26 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT WHERE EVIDENCE IS ADDUCED OF ANY STATE MENT OF THE ACCUSED SUCH STATEMENT MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE A PART OF IT CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AND A PART REJECTED THE JURY MUST CONSIDER ALL OR NONE AND IF THE PROSECUTOR USES THE DECLARATION OF THE PRISONER HE MUST TAKE THE WHOLE TOGETHER AND CANNOT SELECT ONE PART AND LEAVE ANOTHER 27 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT WHEN UPON A CHARGE OF MULRDER THE EVIDENCE IS WHOLLY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AS IS THE CASE HERE THE ABSENCE OF ALL EVIDENCE OF AN INDUCING CAUSE OR MOTIVE TO COMMIT THE OFFENSE CHARGED AF FORDS OF ITSELF A STRONG PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE 28 THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT IN THE APPLICATION OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE CASE THE UTMOST CAUTION AND VIGILANCEE SHOULD BE USED SUCH EVIDENCE IS ALWAYS INSUFFICIENT WHERE ASSUMING ALL TO BE TRUE WHICH THE EVIDENCE TENDS TO PROVE SOME OTHER REASONABLE HYPO THESIS MAY STILL BE TRUE FOR IT IS THE ACTUAL EXCLUSION OF EVERY OTHER REASON ABLE HYPOTHESIS WVHICH INVESTS MERE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE FORCE OF TRUTH WHERE THE EVIDENCE LEAVES IT INDIFFERENT WHICH OF SEVERAL HYPOTHESES IS TRUE OR ESTABLISHES ONLY SOME FINITE PROBABILITY IN FAVOR OF ONE HYPOTHESIS SUCH EVIDENCE CANNOT AMOUNT TO PROOF HOWEVER GREAT THE PROBABILITY MAY BE AND THE COURT FURTHER INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE WHICH TENDS TO ESTABLISH THAT THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY OF THE CRIME WITH WHICH HE IS CHARGED IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND NOT POSITIVE EVIDENCE THEREFORE AL THOUGH THE JURY MAY BELIEVE FROM THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE THAT THERE IS A STRONG PROBABILITY THAT THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED IN THE INDICTMENT STILL IF UPON THE WHOLE EVIDENCE THERE IS ANY OTHER REASONABLE HYPOTHESIS CONSISTENT WITH HIS INNOCENCE THEY CANNOT FIND THE ACCUSED GUILTY AND THIS IS TRUE ALTHOUGH IT MAY APPEAR FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THE PROBABILITIES OF HIS GUILT ARE GREATER THAN THE PROBABILITIES OF HIS INNOCENCE 29 THE JURY ARE FINALLY INSTRUCTED THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN ARE ALL THE

THE EVIDENCE WAS IN OUR JUDGMENT SO CONSID ERED SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN IT THE SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR IS AS TO THE QUALIFICATION OF THE PETIT JUROR J Y STOCKDELL WHO WAS CHALLENGED BY THE PETITIONER HE WAS ASKED IF HE HAD FORMED OR EXPRESSED AN OPINION TO WHICH HE REPLIED I FORMED AN OPINION ON THE NEWSPAPER EVIDENCE HE WAS REMINDED BY COUNSEL THAT IN LAW THE PRISONER WAS PRESUMED TO BE INNOCENT AND HE WAS ASKED IN YOUR PRESENT STATE OF MIND COULD YOU GO ON THAT JURY STARTING OUT WITH THAT PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IN YOUR MIND A I COULD NOT SAY THAT I COULD SIR FOR THE REASON THAT I HAVE READ THIS EVIDENCE NATURAILY THERE IS SOME IMPRESSION ON MY MIND BUT I CANNOT SAY THAT IT IS BIASED OR PREJUDICED THE ONLY THING 1 HAVE HEARD IS ONE SIDE AS PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPERS I MUST SAY THAT EVERYTHING I READ IN THE NEWS PAPERS WAS ONE SIDE AFTER FURTHER QUESTION AND ANSWER COUNSEL ASKED THE JUROR THIS QUESTION IN SPITE OF WHAT YOU HAVE READ AND HEARD YOU COULD GO UPON THIS JURY AND GIVE THE PRISONER A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE COURT AND THE EVIDENCE AS DETAILED BY THE WITNESSES A I FEEL THAT I AM A FAIRMINDED MAN Q BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND MR STOCKDELL THAT WHAT YOU HAVE READ OF THIS CASE HAS DESTROYED IN YOUR MIND1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 893 THE PRESUMPTION OF THE PRISONERS INNOCENCE THAT YOU WOULD NOT GO ON THE JURY PRESUMING HIM TO BE INNOCENT A I DONT KNOW ABOUT THAT IT IS A QUESTION AS TO DRAWING A LINE BETWEEN THINKING HIM INNOCENT AND KNOWING HIM TO BE GUILTY WHICH I DONT KNOW IN ANSWER TO OTHER QUESTIONS THE JUROR STATED THAT AS A FAIR MINDED MAN I COULD RENDER A VERDICT ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND THE EVIDENCE NOT BIASED I HAVE NO PREJUDICE ONE WAY OR OTHER AND THAT AS TO INNOCENCE OR GUILT HE WOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE EVIDENCE AND THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE COURT AFTER NUMEROUS QUESTIONS HAD BEEN ASKED AND REITERATED THE OBJECT OF WHICH WAS TO ASCERTAIN THE PRECISE CHARACTER AND STRENGTH OF THE OPINION WHICH THE JUROR HAD FORMED AND EXPRESSED COUNSEL ASKED HIM THE FOLLOWING QUESTION DO YOU FEEL AT THIS MOMENT THAT THERE IS A PRESUMPTION IN YOUR MIND THAT THIS DEFENDANT IS AN INNOCENT MAN TO WHICH HE REPLIED I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THIS THAT I FEEL THAT I AM AN HONEST AND UNBIASED MAN AND AS SUCH THAT I COULD ENTER THIS JURY UNPREJUDICED AND UNBIASED AND GIVE THE PRISONER A TRIAL ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND THE EVIDENCE IF I DID NOT FEEL SO I WOULD WANT TO BE TURNECL OUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I FEEL THAT I COULD SERVE AND AM CALLED HERE TO SERVE AND THAT IT IS THEREFORE MY DUTY TO SERVE BY THE COURT  DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN GO INTO THIS TRIAL LEAVING YOUR MIND OPEN TO THE EVIDENCE FREE FROM ANY PREVIOUSLY READ ACCOUNTS IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND GO THROUGH THE TRIAL BELIEVING HIM INNOCENT UNTIL HE IS PROVED GUILTY  A YES SIR AND THEREUPON THE JUROR WAS ACCEPTED THE CASES UPON THIS SUBJECT ARE ALMOST WITHOUT NUMBER AND THEY ARE NOT TO BE RECONCILED THE TREND OF RECENT DECISIONS IS IN THE DIRECTION OF LIMITING RATHER THAN EXTENDING THE DISQUALIFICATION OF JURORS BY REASON OF MERE OPINION WHATEVER THE MIND RECEIVES HAS AN EFFECT UPON IT PASSING WITH ALMOST INFINITE GRADUATION FROM A MERE IMPRESSION TO A FIXED BELIEF THE STATE STRAINS EVERY NERVE TO DISSERNINATE KNOWLEDGE BY THE DIFFUSION OF EDUCATION IT HOPES TO CREATE A HIGHER CITIZENSHIP AND TO FIND THE MEANS OF REPRESSING VICE AND CRIME BUT IF THE COURTS TAKE AN EXTREME POSITION UPON THIS SUBJECT AND HOLD THAT EVERY OPINION SHALL WORK A DISQUALIFICATION FOR SERVICE AS A JUROR THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WILL BE CONFIDED NOT

INQUIRE INTO THE QUALITY AND DEGREE OF THE OPINION AND TO THAT END SEARCH THE CONSCIENCE OF THE JUROR UPON HIS VOIR DIRE AND LOOK INTO THE SOURCES OF THE INFOR MATION UPON WHICH HIS OPINION RESTS NO MAN CAN READ THE RIGID EXAMINATION TO WHICH THIS JUROR WAS SUBJECTED WITHOUT BEING IMPRESSED WITH HIS FAIRNESS WITH HIS DE SIRE TO DEAL JUSTLY BY THE PRISONER AND WITH HIS CONSCIENTIOUS PUR POSE TO DISCHARGE HIS DUTY AS A CITIZEN IN MORANS CASE 9 LEIGH 651 TWO JURORS WERE EXAMINED UPON THEIR VOIR DIRE ONE STATED THAT HE HAD HEARD THE CASE SPOKEN OF IN THE TOWN AND RUMORS IN REGARD TO ITS CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH HE HAD EXPRESSED NO OPINION THOUGH HE BELIEVES THOSE RUMORS TO BE TRUE AND IF THEY SHOULD TURN OUT UPON THE TRIAL TO BE TRUE HE HAS A DECIDED OPINION IN REGARD TO THE CASE BUT HE FEELS NO PREJU DICE AND IS SATISFIED THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DECIDE THE CASE UPON THE EVIDENCE WHICH MAY BE GIVEN IN UNINFLUENCED BY THE RUMORS HE HAD HEARD HIS OPINION WAS THAT IF THE PRISONER HAD FTABBED THE DECEASED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD HEARD HE OUGHT TO BE PUNISHED THE OTHER JUROR STATED THAT HE HAD MADE UP NO DE CIDED OPINION THAT HE HAD HEARD A PART OF THE EVIDENCE OF ONE WIT NESS AND FORMED AN IMPRESSION AND IF THE BALANCE OF THE TESTIMONY SHOULD RUN THAT WAY THAT IMPRESSION WOULD BE CONFIRMED THAT SO FAR AS THE EVIDENCE WENT HE HAD A DECIDED OPINION IF THE REST SHOULD NOT RUN AGAINST IT BUT THAT HE HAD NO PREJUDICE HAD NOT EXPRESSED ANY OPINION AND WAS PREPARED TO DECIDE THE CASE ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE WHICH MIGHT BE GIVEN IN UNINFLUENCED BY THE PORTION OF EVIDENCE HE HAD HEARD BOTH JURORS WERE HELD TO BE COMPETENT IN SMITH V COMMONWEALTH 6 GRATT 696 A JUROR STATED THAT HE HAD READ THE EVIDENCE AS PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND HAD FORMED AND EXPRESSEDTHE OPINION THOUGH IT WAS NOT A DECIDED ONE THAT THE PRISONER WAS GUILTY THAT HE WAS SATISFIED THAT HE COULD GIVE THE PRISONER A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL NOTWITHSTANDING HIS IMPRESSIONS AND WITHOUT BEING INFLUENCED BV THEM ON HEARING THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT THE TRIAL ANOTHER TATED THAT HE HAD FORMED AND EXPRESSED A DECIDED OPINION FOUNDED ON A REPORT OF THE EVI DENCE BEFORE THBE MAYOR PULBLISHED IN THE PAPERS BUT NOT SUCH AN OPINION AS WOULD INFLUENCE HIS MIND IF ACCEPTED AS A JURYMAN THAT THE OPINION SO FORMED WOULD NATURALLV BE RECALLED TO HIS IMEMORY1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V

ANY OF THE EVIDENCE NOR BAD BE BEARD ANY REPORT OF IT FROM THOSE WHO HAD HEARD IT BUT FROM THE RUMOR OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD HE HAD FORMED AN OPINION WHICH AT THE TIME HE SPOKE WAS EXISTING ON HIS MIND AND WHICH HE SHOULD STICK TO UNLESS THE EVIDENCE TURN ED OUT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT RUMOR HAD REPORTED IT TO BE THAT HE HAD NO PREJUDICE NOR PARTIALITY FOR OR AGAINST THE PRISONER AND BELIEVED HE COULD GIVE HIM A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN IN HELD THAT HE WAS A PROPER JUROR IN JACKSONS CASE 23 GRATT 919 JUDGE MONCURE DELIVERING THE OPINION OF THE COURT GOES FULLY INTO THIS SUBJECT HE SAYS THERE IS NO QUESTION PERHAPS ABOUT WHICH THERE HAS BEEN MORE APPARENT CONFLICT OF DECISION IN THIS STATE OR IN REGARD TO WHICH IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO DERIVE FROM OUR MANY CASES ON THE SUBJECT ANY DEFINITE RULES WHICH WILL APPLY TO ALL CASES THAT MAY ARISE THE OBJECT OF THE LAW IS TO SECURE TO EVERY MAN WHO IS CHARGED WITH A CRIMINAL OFFENSE A TRIAL BY AN IMPARTIAL JURY AND THIS RULE HAS BEEN ESTAB LISHED BY THE CASES IF NO OTHER THAT IF A VENIREMAN HAS FORMED AND STILL MORE IF HE HAS FORMED AND EXPRESSED A DECIDED OR SUB STANTIAL OPINION AS TO THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF THE ACCUSED NO INAT TER UPON WHAT GROUND IT WAS FORMED WHETHER FROM HAVING HEARD THE EVIDENCE ON SOME FORMER TRIAL OR EXAMINATION OR FROM MERE RUMOR OR OTHERWISE HE IS AN INCOMPETENT JUROR TO TRY THE CASE AND IF ON THE OTHER HAND HIS OPINION BE MERELY HYPOTHETICAL HE IS NOT INCOMPETENT ON THAT GROUND THE DIFFICULTY IS IN DETERMINING IN ANY GIVEN CASE WHETHER THE OPINION BE DECIDED OR SUBSTANTIAL OR MERELY HYPOTHETICAL THERE BEING IN ALMOST EVERY CASE SOME PECULIAR ITY OF CIRCUMSTANCE AND THE DESIRE TO REMOVE OR LESSEN THIS DIF FICULTY BY LAYING DOWN CERTAIN OTHER RULES FOR OUR GUIDANCE HAS BEEN THE FRUITFUL SOURCE OF THE APPARENT CONFLICT IN MANY OF THE CASES THUS IF A VENIREMAN HAS FORMED AN OPINION AS TO THE GUILT OR IN NOCENCE OF THE ACCUSED FROM HAVING HEARD THE EVIDENCE ON A FORMER TRIAL OR EXAMINATION OF THE CASE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOS SIBLE TO REGARD SUCH OPINION OTHERWISE THAN AS DECIDED OR SUBSTAN TIAL WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE RULE AND HE WOULD GENERALLV IF NOT ALWAYS BE CONSIDERED AN INCOMPETENT JUROR EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT896 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB THINK AND SAY THAT HE COULD GIVE THE ACCUSED AN IMPARTIAL TRIAL SO ON THE OTHER HAND IF A VENIREMAN HAS FORMED AN OPINION AS TO THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF THE ACCUSED FROM MERE RUMOR THE PRESUIMP TION IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY IS THAT SUCH OPINION IS MERELY HYPOTHETICAL AND WILL BE SO CONSIDERED EVEN THOUGH HE SPEAK OF IT AS A DECIDED OR SUBSTANTIAL OPINION IF HE SAYS HE HAS NO PREJUDICE AGAINST THE ACCUSED AND THINKS HE CAN GIVE HIM A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL BUT IF THE COURT BE SATISFIED EITHER FROM THE VENIRE MANS OWN STATEMENT OR OTHERWISE THAT THE OPINION IS IN FACT DE CIDED OR SUBSTANTIAL HE WILL BE AN INCOMPETENT JUROR THERE ARE INTERMEDIATE CASES WHICH OFTEN GIVE RISE TO DIFFICULTY ON THIS SUBJECT THE VENIREMEN MAY HAVE FORMED AN OPINION FROM HAVING HEARD A PART ONLY OF THE EVIDENCE ON A FORMER TRIAL OR FROM HAVING HEARD THE WHOLE OR PART OF THE EVIDENCE GIVEN ON A FORMER TRIAL THROUGH PERSONS WHO WERE PRESENT IN WHOSE VERACITY AND ACCURACY HE MAY HAVE MORE OR LESS CONFIDENCE OR FROM HAVING READ AN ACCOUNT OF SUCH EVIDENCE IN A NEWSPAPER WE CANNOT LAY DOWN ANY RULE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF SUCH CASES EXCEPT THE GENERAL RULE BEFORE STATED AND THE COURT MUST DETERMINE AS BEST IT MAY WHETHER THE OPINION BE DECIDED OR SUBSTANTIAL OR MERELY HYPOTHETICAL IT WOULD BE DAN GEROUS TO LAY DOWN A RULE AND NO CASE HAS EVER DECIDED THAT A VENIREMAN WHO HAS FORMED AN OPINION FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVED FROM WITNESSES OUT OF COURT AND STILL LESS FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVED FRON OTHERS AS TO STATEMENTS MADE BY WITNESSES EITHER IN OR OUT OF COURT IS THEREFORE NECESSARILY AN INCOMPETENT JUROR EVEN THOUGH HE MAY REGARD THE PERSONS FROM WHOM HE RECEIVED HIS INFORMATION AS PER SONS OF GENERAL VERACITY AND ACCURACY AND MAY CREDIT WHAT HE HAS HEARD FROM THEM WE KNOW THAT WITNESSES WHO MAKE STATEMENTS OUT OF COURT OF TRANSACTIONS ABOUT WHICH THEY MAY HAVE TESTIFIED IN COURT STILL MORE PERSONS WHO PROFESS TO DETAIL WHAT THEY MAY HAVE HEARD IN OR OUT OF COURT OFTEN SPEAK CARELESSLY AND GENERALLY OMIT TING PARTICULARS WHICH MAY BE VERY MATERIAL AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE WHO LISTEN TO THEM OFTEN LISTEN CARELESSLY AND THOUGH THEY ALMOST ALWAYS FORM SOME IMPRESSION OR OPINION OF THE CASE FRONM WHAT THEY HEAR YET THAT OPINION IS NOT ALWAYS AND PERHAPS NOT OFTEN DECIDED OR SUBSTANTIAL IN THE MEANING OF THE RULE AFORESAID THE COURT MUST DETERMINE THAT QUESTION IN ALL SUCH CASES IN VIEW OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE COURSE OF HIS OPINION HE CITES NUMEROUS AUTHORITIES AND1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 897 QUOTES WITH APPROVAL THE LANGUAGE OF JUDGE SUMMERS IN MORANS CASE SUPRA IN WHICH HE USES THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE SUSTAINING CHALLENGES TO JURORS FOR FAVOR ON SLIGHT GROUNDS TENDS TO PLACE THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC JUSTICE IN THE HANDS OF THE MOST IGNORANT AND LEAST DISCRIMINATING PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY BY WHICH THE SAFETY OF THE ACCUSED MAY BE ENDANGERED AND THE PROPER ADMINIS TRATION OF THE LAWS PUT TO HAZARD AND WE ARE THEREFORE NOT DIS POSED TO ENLARGE THE GROUNDS OF CHALLENGE BEYOND THOSE PROPERLY DEDUCIBLE FROM THE CASES HERETOFORE DECIDED AS WE HAVE SAID THE CASES ARE NOT RECONCILABLE BUT WE BELIEVE THOSE WEHAVE CITED ESTABLISH A WISE AND SALUTARY RULE WHEN TO THESE CONSIDERATIONS IT IS ADDED AS HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY REITERATED BY THIS COURT THAT GREAT WEIGHT IS JUSTLY DUE TO THE OPINION OF THE TRIAL JUDGE WHO SEES AND HEARS THE VENIREMEN WE HAVE NO HESITATION IN REJECTING THIS ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR THESE CONSIDERATIONS LEAD TO THE SAME CONCLUSION WITH REFERENCE TO THE JUROR WOOD THE NEXT EXCEPTION IS AS TO THE COMPETENCY OF THE WITNESS KAUF MAN WHO WAS INTRODUCED BY THE COMMONWEALTH TO PROVE THAT A PIECE OF CLOTH FOUND IN THE BATH ROOM ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE AL LEGED HOMICIDE WAS A PART OF THE UNDERSHIRT WORN BY THE PRISONER ON THAT OCCASION KAUFMAN IT APPEARS IS ENGAGED IN THE CLOTHING BUSINESS AND IS A SALESMAN OF AND DEALER IN UNDERWEAR BUT HAS NEVER MANUFACTURED IT FONTAINE EDDINS A CLERK IN A CLOTHING STORE WAS INTRODUCED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AND BOTH WERE PERMITTED TO TESTIFY OVER THE OBJECTION OF THE PRISONER IN THIS THERE WAS NO ERROR IT WAS FOR THE COURT TO SAY WHAT EVI DENCE SHOULD BE ADMITTED IT WAS FOR THE JURY BEFORE WHOM THE WITNESSES WERE SUBJECTED TO INVESTIGATION AS TO THEIR SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE TO DETERMINE UPON THEIR CREDIBILITY AND THE WEIGHT TO BE GIVEN TO THEIR TESTIMONY THE ELEVENTH EXCEPTION IS TO THE ADMISSION OF A CONVERSATION BE TWEEN THE PRISONER AND HIS SON WILLIAM MCCUE AS TESTIFIED TO FOR THE COMMONWEALTH BY THE WITNESS MARTIN IN THIS CONVERSATION PETITIONER ACCORDING TO THE WITNESS SAID THAT HE HIS SON KNEW THAT THE STATEMENT MADE BY ERNEST CRAWFORD ABOUT PETITIONERS HAVING DRAWN A PISTOL UPON HIS WIFE WAS NOT TRUE TO WHICH PETI TIONERS SON REPLIED BY AFFIRMING THAT PETITIONER DID DRAW A PISTOL898 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB UPON HIS WIFE THIS IS OBJECTED TO UPON THE GROUND THAT THERE IS NO SUGGESTION OR APPROXIMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME AT WHICH THE OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF THIS CONVERSA TION THAT IT NOWHERE APPEARS WHETHER IT WAS A WEEK OR A MONTH OR A YEAR OR FIVE YEARS OR TEN YEARS BEFORE THE HOMICIDE THE TESTIMONY WITH RESPECT TO THE INCIDENT IN THE JAIL WAS NOT IN TRODUCED AS PROOF OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE NARRATED IT DOES NOT PR VE OR TEND TO PROVE AND THERE WAS NO PURPOSE IN ITS INTRODUCTION TO PROVE THAT THE ACCUSED AT ANY TIME THREATENED HIS WIFE WITH A PISTOL AND THAT SHE SOUGHT THE PROTECTION OF HER SON ERNEST CRAWFORD HAD TESTIFIED BEFORE THE JURY THAT WILLIAM MCCUE SO STATED TO HIM AND MARTINS TESTIMONY WAS INTRODUCED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOWING THAT MCCUE ENDEAVORED TO INDUCE HIS SON TO DENV THE STATEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO HIM BY CRAWFORD IF THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO WHICH CRAW FORD REFERRED WAS INADMISSIBLE FOR REMOTENESS IN POINT OF TIME OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON OBJECTION TO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE WHEN CRAWFORD WAS UPON THE STAND BUT THERE COULD BE NO OBJECTION TO IT WHEN INTRODUCED FOR THE PURPOSE INDICATED THE PRECISE LANGUAGE OF THE PRISONER ON THAT OCCASION WAS AS FOL LOWS THE PRISONER SAID TO HIS SON YOU KNOW IT IS NOT SO ABOUT WHAT ERNEST CRAWFORD SAID ABOUT MY DRAWING A PISTOL ON YOUR MOTHER TO WHICH THE SON REPLIED YOU DID AND SHE RUN IN THE ROOM AND GOT IN THE BED WITH ME AND ASKED ME NOT TO LET YOT SHOOT HER NOR IS THE TESTIMONY OF MARTIN INADMISSIBLE BECAUSE IN EFFECT AN ACCUSATION AGAINST THE PRISONER WHICH HE THEN AND THERE CONTROVERTED AND DENIED THE CONVERSATION WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE PRISONER WHO WAS APPARENTLY SEEKING TO FIND THE MEANS OF WEAKENING THE FORCE OF CRAWFORDS STATEMENT AND HE SAID TO HIS SON YOU KNOW IT IS NOT TRUE THAT I DREW A PISTOL ON YOUR MOTHER AND THE DENIAL COMES FROM THE SON YOU DID AND SHE RUN IN THE ROOM AND GOT IN THE BED WITH ME AND ASKED ME NOT TO LET YOU SHOOT HER WHAT WAS SAID WITH ALL THE ATTENDING CIRCUMSTANCES WAS BEFORE THE JURY AND WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THERE WAS NO ERROR IN THIS RUL ING OF THE COURT THERE ARE SEVERAL EXCEPTIONS TO EVIDENCE WHICH SEEM TO US TO BE IMMATERIAL AND TO DISCUSS WHICH WOULD UNDULY PROTRACT THIS OPIN ION THAT FOR INSTANCE OF THE WITNESS COVINGTON WHO TESTIFIED THAT HE SPOKE TO PETITIONERS WIFE AT ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE 81905 J

PLEASURE AND ENJOYMENT IN LIFE THE FIFTEENTH EXCEPTION IS TO THE TESTIMONY OF DR NELSON WHO WAS PERMITTED TO TESTIFY AS TO THE EFFECTS OF A BLOW STRUCK BY A SAND BAG OR OTHER SIMILAR INSTRUMENT IT HARDLY REQUIRES THE LEARNING OR EXPERIENCE OF A PRACTITIONER OF MEDICINE TO KNOW THAT IF A MAN WAS STRUCK BY A SAND BAG A BLOW SUFFICIENT TO RENDER HIM UNCONSCIOUS THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST SOME SLIGHT DISCOLORATION OR EXTERNAL MARK OR AFTER EFFECT CONSEQUENT UPON THE BLOW THIS ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR IS ALSO OVERRULED THE ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR FROM THE SIXTEENTH TO THIRTYTHIRD IN CLUSIVE PRESENT A QUESTION OF MUCH IMPORTANCE IN THIS PROSECUTION WILLIAM MCCUE A SON OF THE PRISONER WAS INTRODUCED AS A WIT NESS BY THE COMMONWEALTH AND IT SPEEDILY APPEARING THAT HE WAS ADVERSE TO THE COMMONWEALTH AND FAVORABLE TO THE PRISONER THE COMMONWEALTH ALLEGING THAT IT WAS SURPRISED ASKED AND WAS PER MITTED TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE WITNESS HAD MADE STATEMENTS INCONSISTENT WITH HIS TESTIMONY SO MUCH OF SEC 3351 OF VA CODE 1904 AS IS PERTINENT TO THIS INQUIRY IS AS FOLLOWS A PARTY CALLED TO TESTIFY FOR ANOTHER HAVING AN ADVERSE INTEREST MAY BE EXAMINED BY SUCH OTHER PARTY ACCORDING TO THE RULES APPLICABLE TO CROSS EXAMINATION 1 A PARTY PRODUCING A WITNESS SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO IMPEACH HIS CREDIT BY GENERAL EVIDENCE OF BAD CHARACTER BUT HE MAY IN CASE THE WITNESS SHALL IN THE OPINION OF THE COURT PROVE ADVERSE CONTRADICT HIM BY OTHER EVIDENCE OR BY LEAVE OF THE COURT PROVE THAT HE HAS MADE AT OTHER TIMES A STATEMENT INCONSISTENT WITH HIS PRESENT TESTIMONY BUT BEFORE SAID LAST MENTIONED PROOF CAN BE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SUPPOSED STATEMENT SUFFICIENT TO DESIGNATE THE PARTICULAR OCCASION MUST BE MENTIONED TO THE WITNESS AND HE MUST BE ASKED WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS MADE SUCH STATEMENT IN EVERY CASE THE COURT IF REQUESTED BY EITHER PARTY SHALL INSTRUCT THE JURY NOT TO CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE OF SUCH INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS EXCEPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTRADICTING THE WITNESS THE LAW JUST QUOTED IS SO COMPREHENSIVE IN ITS TERMS THAT WE SHALL CONTENT OURSELVES WITH OBSERVING THAT IT WARRANTS THE ACTION OF THE COURT IN THIS CASE UNLESS AS THE PETITIONER INSISTS ITS OPERA TION IS TO BE CONFINED TO CIVIL CASES THE LAW OF EVIDENCE IS IN GENERAL THE SAME IN CIVIL AND IN CRIMINAL CASES IN EACH CASE THE OBJECT IS THE SAMETO PLACE EVIDENCE BEFORE THE JURY WHICH WILL900 1 0 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB ENABLE IT TO ARRIVE AT A JUST DECISION UPON THE ISSUES IT HAS LONG BEEN A SUBJECT OF INVESTIGATION BEFORE THE COURT TEXTWRITERS AND LEGISLATURES HOW FAR IT IS PERMISSIBLE FOR A PARTY TO CONTRADICT HIS OWN WITNESS IN WIGMORE ON EVIDENCE VOL 2 SEES 897 TO 908 INCLUSIVE THE WHOLE SUBJECT IS EXHAUSTIVELY DISCUSSED AND THE VIEWS OF EMINENT AUTHORITIES GIVEN LORD ELLENBOROUGH IS QUOTED AS SAYING IN ALEXANDER V GIBSON 2 CAMIP 555 IF A WITNESS IS CALLED ON THE PART OF THE PLAINTIFF WHO SWEARS WHAT IS PALPABLY FALSE IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HARD IF THE PLAINTIFFS CASE SHOULD FOR THAT REASON BE SACRIFICED BUT I KNOW OF NO RULE OF LAW BY WHICH THE TRUTH IS ON SUCH AN OCCASION TO BE SHLUT OUT AND JUSTICE IS TO BE PERVERTED CHIEF JUSTICE TINDALS REMARKS IN BRADLEY V RICARDO 8 BING 58 ARE CITED THE OBJECT OF ALL THE LAWS OF EVIDENCE IS TO BRING THE WHOLE TRUTH OF A CASE BEFORE THE JURY    BUT IF THIS CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE WERE EXCLUDED THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE TLIE JUST GROUND ON WHICH THE PRINCIPLES OF EVIDENCE WOULD PROCEED BUT WE SHOULD COMPEL THE PLAINTIFF TO TAKE SINGLY ALL THE CHANCES OF THE TABLES AND TO BE BOUND BY THE STATEMENTS OF A WITNESS WHOM HE MIGHT CALL WITHOUT KNOWING HE WAS AVERSE WHO MIGHT LABOR UNDER A DEFECT OF MEMORY OR BE OTHERWISE UNABLE TO MAKE A STATEMENT ON WHICH COMPLETE RELIANCE MIGHT BE PLACED THE REASONING AND AUTHORITIES RANGE ALL THE WAY FROM PERMISSION TO REFRESH THE MEMORY OF AN ADVERSE WITNESS BY CROSSEXAMINATION TO THE PRACTICE WHICH FINDS EXPRESSION IN THE STATUTE UNDER CONSID ERATION OF PROVING HIS INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS IN ENGLAND THE SUBJECT WAS REFERRED TO A COMMISSION COMPOSED OF EMINENT JURISTS AND THEY REPORTED IN FAVOR OF THE ADMISSION OF IMPEACHING TESTIMONY BY PROOF OF CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS FOR THE ADMISSIBILITYOF THE PROPOSED EVIDENCE IT IS SAID THAT THIS COURSE IS NECESSARY AS A SECURITY AGAINST THE CONTRIVANCE OF AN ARTFUL WIT NESS WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO THE PARTY BY THE PROMISE OF FAVORABLE EVIDENCE BEING REALLY IN THE INTEREST OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY AND AFTERWARDS BY HOSTILE EVIDENCE RUIN HIS CAUSE THAT SUCH A POWER IS NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PLACING THE WVIT IIESS FAIRLY AND COMPLETELY BEFORE THE COURT AND FOR ENABLING THE JURY TO ASCERTAIN HOW FAR HE DESERVES TO BE BELIEVED THAT THE ENDS OF JUSTICE ARE BEST ATTAINED BY ALLOWING THE FULLEST POWER FOR SCRUTI1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 901 NIZING AND CORRECTING EVIDENCE AND THAT THE EXCLUSION OF THE PROOF OF CONTRARY STATEMENTS MIGHT BE ATTENDED WITH THE WORST CONSE QUENCES THE CHIEF OBJECTION TO THE PROPOSED EVIDENCE APPEARS TO BE THAT A PARTY AFTER CALLING A WITNESS AS A WITNESS OF CREDIT OUGHT NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO DISCREDIT HIM THE OBJECTION PROCEEDS UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE PARTY FIRST ACTS ON ONE PRINCIPLE AND AFTER WARDS BEING DISAPPOINTED BY THE WITNESS TURNS AROUND AND ACTS UPON ANOTHER THUS IMPUTING TO THE PARTY SOMETHING OF DOUBLE DEALING OR DISHONEST PRACTICE BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CASE WHERE A PARTY HAVING GIVEN CREDIT TO A WITNESS IS DECEIVED BY HIM AND FIRST DISCOVERS THE DECEIT AT THE TRIAL OF THE CAUSE TO REJECT THE PROPOSED EVIDENCE IN SUCH A CASE AND REPRESS THE TRUTH WOULD BE TO ALLOW THE WITNESS TO DECEIVE BOTH JURY AND PARTY IN BABCOCK V PEOPLE 13 COLO 519 JUDGE ELLIOTT SAID THE TENDENCY OF RECENT LEGISLATION AS WELL AS OF MODERN DECISIONS HAS BEEN TO RELAX SOMEWHAT THE RULES OF EVIDENCE SO AS TO AFFORD BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRUTH MODERN EXPERIENCE HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT A PARTY MAY SOMETINES BE DECEIVED IN THE CHARACTER AND ANIMUS OF A WITNESS WHOM HE HAS CALLED AS WELL AS IN THE TESTI MONY HE IS EXPECTED TO GIVE AND HE LEARNSI AFTER THE WITNESS BEGINS TO TESTIFYA VERY INOPPORTUNE TIMETHAT BE HAS TO ENCOUNTER BIT TER AND UNSCRUPULOUS OPPOSITION WHERE HE HAD EXPECTED TO RECEIVE ONLY FAIR AND HONORABLE TREATMENT THIS MAY BE EVIDENCED BY RE LUCTANCE OR EVASION ON THE PART OF THE WITNESS IN ANSWERING QUES TIONS OR BY TOO GREAT READINESS IN MAKING OR VOLUNTEERING DAMAGING STATEMENTS CONTRARY TO HIS PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE MATTER UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES    IN EXTREME CASES WHERE IT IS APPARENT THAT A WITNESS IS GIVING TESTIMONY CONTRARY TO THE REASONABLE EXPEC TATION OF THE PARTY CALLING HIM SUCH PARTY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CROSSEXAMINE SUCH WITNESS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING HIS RECOL LECTION WITH THE VIEW OF MODIFVING HIS TESTIMONY OR OF REVEALING HIS ANIMUS IN THE CASE    AND TO ASK HIM IF HE HAS NOT

IN THE OPINION OF THE JUDGE PROVE ADVERSE CONTRADICT HIM BY OTHER EVIDENCE OR BY LEAVE OF THE JUDGE PROVE THAT HE HAS MADE AT OTHER TIMES A STATEMENT INCONSISTENT WITH HIS PRESENT TESTIMONY IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE SAYS THE AUTHOR THE CONFUSION CAUSED BY THIS BUNGLING PARAGRAPH FOR THE SHOWING OF AN ERROR BY ORDI NARY CONTRADICTION PROVIDED FOR IN CLAUSE 3 WAS ALREADY FREELY PER MISSIBLE WITHOUT INTERFERENCE BY THE JUDGE AND WHETHER OR NOT THE WITNESS WAS ADVERSE    AS THE STATUTE STANDS THE PRESENT CLASS OF EVIDENCE SELFCONTRADICTIONS IS ADMISSIBLE ONLY BY LEAVE OF THE JUDGE AND IN CASE OF A WITNESS DEEMED ADVERSE BY THE JUDGE IN THE UNITED STATES FORTUNATELY ONLY A FEW JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED THE ENGLISH STATUTE BUT THE VARIETY OF ATTITUDE IN THE DIF FERENT JURISDICTIONS AND THE INDISCRIMINATE CITATION OF RULINGS FROM OTHER COURTS TOGETHER WITH THE INDECISION OF THE EARLIER ENGLISH PRECEDENTS HAS TENDED TO PRODUCE CONFUSION IN OUR LAW EVEN WITHIN THE RULINGS OF THE SAME

STATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY MADE BY HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING HIS RECOLLECTION AND INDUCING HIM TO CORRECT HIS TESTIMONY AND THE PARTY SO SURPRISED MAY ALSO SHOW THE FACTS TO BE OTHERWISE THAN AS STATED ALTHOUGH THIS INCIDENTALLY TENDS TO DISCREDIT THE WITNESS    BUT PROOF OF CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS OF ONES OWN WITNESS VOLUNTARILY CALLED AND NOT A PARTY INASMUCH AS IT WOULD NOT AMOUNT TO SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE AND COULD HAVE NO EFFECT BUT TO IMPAIR THE CREDIT OF THE WITNESS WAS GENERALLY NOT ADMISSIBLE AT COMMON LAW1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTH 903 BY STATUTE IN ENGLAND AND IN MANY

IN THE FIRST PLACE IT SHOWS WHAT THE COMMON LAW WAS IT SHOWS THE TENDENCY OF MODERN THOUGHT UPON THE SUBJECT AND ALTHOUGH MADE IN A CASE WHERE A MAN WAS ON TRIAL FOR HIS LIFE RESTS THE STATEMENTS OF LAW UPON ADJUDICATIONS IN CIVIL CASES UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE LEGISLATURE OF VIRGINIA ADOPTED THE STATUTE WHICH WE ARE NOW CONSIDERING ITS LANGUAGE IS BROAD AND GENERAL THERE IS NOT A SUGGESTION

APPLICATION TO BE DETERMINED BY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS WE CANNOT THINK THAT THE MERE COLLOCATION OF THIS SECTION SHOULD OVERRIDE EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION AND REQUIRE THE COURTS TO CONFINE IT TO CIVIL CASES WHEN IT IS A REMEDY FOR AN EVIL AS GREAT IN CRIMINAL AS IN CIVIL CASES AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH MAY BE EVEN MORE SERIOUS WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THESE ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR ARE NOT WELL TAKEN904 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB A CAREFUL PERUSAL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS SATISFIES US THAT THEY FAIRLY SUBMITTED TO THE JURY THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW BY WHICH THEY SHOULD BE GOVERNED IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE EVIDENCE IT WOULD BE IM POSSIBLE TO PREPARE INSTRUCTIONS TO WHICH AN INGENIOUS CRITIC MIGHT NOT PRESENT PLAUSIBLE OBJECTION THE DEFINITION OF REASONABLE DOUBT IS ATTEMPTED BY THE COURT IT IS A DIFFICULT IF NOT AN IMPOS SIBLE TASK SO TO DEFINE IT AS TO SATISFY A SUBTLE AND METAPHYSICAL MIND BENT UPON THE DETECTION OF SOME POINT HOWEVER ATTENUATED UPON WHICH TO HANG A CRITICISM BUT NO UNBIASED PERSON CAN READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS WITHOUT HAVING THE CONVICTION FORCED UPON HIM THAT EVERY SAFEGUARD WHICH THE BENIGNITY OF THE LAW THROWS AROUND A PRISONER UPON TRIAL WAS ACCORDED TO THE PETITIONER IN THE CASE TWO INSTRUCTIONS ASKED FOR BY THE PETITIONER WERE REFUSED BY THE COURT ONE OF WHICH UNDERTAKES TO DEFINE REASONABLE DOUBT AS FOL LOWS THE COURT INSTRUCTS THE JURY THAT BY REASONABLE DOUBT IS MEANT SUCH DOUBT AS WOULD CAUSE A MAN OF AVERAGE PRUDENCE TO HESITATE ABOUT A MATTER OF HIS OWN OF LIKE IMPORTANCE TO HIMSELF AS THE CASE ON TRIAL IS TO THE ACCUSED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE JURY TO MAKE ANY PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSITION SOUGHT TO BE FORMULATED IN THIS IN STRUCTION THERE COULD BE NO CASE OF IMPORTANCE TO A MAN SUCH AS THE CASE ON TRIAL WAS TO THE ACCUSED UNLESS HE HIMSELF STOOD UPON HIS DELIVERANCE BEFORE A JURY CHARGED WITH A CAPITAL OFFENSE BUT THE INSTRUCTION WAS PROPERLY REFUSED UPON THE FURTHER GROUND THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE COURT UPON THE SUBJECT OF REA SONABLE DOUBT WERE AMPLE AND CORRECT GUIDES TO THE JURY UPON THAT BRANCH OF THE CASE THE COURT WAS ASKED TO INSTRUCT THE JURY THAT UNDER THE HU MANE POLICY OF THE LAW OF THIS STATE IT IS CONSIDERED INFINITELY BET TER THAT NINETY AND NINE THAT IS AN INDEFINITE NUMBER OF GUILTY PERSONS SHOULD ESCAPE PUNISHINENT THAN THAT ONE INNOCENT PERSON SHOULD BE PUNISHED AND THEREFORE IT IS FAR BETTER THAT THE JURV SHOULD ERR IN ACQUITTAL THAN ERR IN CONVICTING WE HAVE HEARD IT SAID AND IT IS SOMETIMES STATED IN THE OPINIONS OF COURTS THAT IT IS BETTER THAT NINETY AND NINE GUILTY PERSONS SHOULD ESCAPE THAN THAT ONE INNOCENT PERSON SHOULD BE PUNISHED WE HAVE NO FAULT TO FIND WITH THE EXPRESSION AS A RHETORICAL PHRASE BUT AS A GUIDE TO A JURY IN REACHING A CONCLUSION IT IS OF NO VALUE THAT NO GUILTV MEN SHOULD ESCAPE IS EQUIALLY INDISPUTABLE BUT IT WOULD1905 J SAMUEL MCUE V COMMONWEALTRH 905 HARDLY FIND A PROPER PLACE IN AN INSTRUCTION TO A JURY THE OBJECT OF COURTS AND JURIES IS TO SHIELD THE INNOCENT AND TO PUNISH THE GUILTY AND IN THIS CASE THE JURY WERE TOLD THAT THE ACCUSED WAS PRE SUMED TO BE INNOCENT UNTIL HIS GUILT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE COM MONWEALTH BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THIS PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE GOES WITH HIM THROUGH THE ENTIRE CASE AND APPLIES AT EVERY STAGE THEREOF AND THAT IF AFTER HAVING HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE THE JURY HAVE A REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED UPON THE WHOLE CASE OR AS TO ANY FACT ESSENTIAL TO PROVE THE CHARGE MADE AGAINST HIM IN THE INDICTMENT IT IS THEIR DUTY TO GIVE HIM THE BENE FIT OF THE DOUBT AND FIND HIM NOT GUILTY AND FURTHER THAT IF UPON THE WHOLE EVIDENCE THERE IS ANY REASONABLE HYPOTHESIS CON SISTENT WITH THE INNOCENCE OF THE ACCUSED THEY MUST FIND HIM NOT GUILTY THAT THE FAILURE OF THE EVIDENCE TO DISCLOSE ANY OTHER CRIM INAL AGENT THAN THE ACCUSED IS NOT A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED BY THE JURY IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS GUILTY OF THE CRIME WHEREWITH HE IS CHARGED THAT HE IS PRESUMED TO BE INNOCENT UNTIL HIS GUILT IS ESTABLISHED AND HE IS NOT TO BE PREJUDICED BY THE INABILITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH TO POINT TO ANY OTHER CRIM INAL AGENT NOR IS HE CALLED UPON TO VINDICATE HIS OWN INNOCENCE BY NAMING THE GUILTY PERSON IT IS ALSO TO BE OBSERVED THAT THE COURT WAS CAREFUL IN INSTRUCTING THE JURY AS TO THE WEIGHT TO BE GIVEN TO THE EVIDENCE OF CONTRADIC TORY STATEMENTS MADE BY THE WITNESS WILLIAM MCCUE AND OTHERS THE JURY WAS WARNED THAT THIS EVIDENCE WAS ADMISSIBLE ONLY TO CON TRADICT THE WITNESS AND NOT TO BE TAKEN AS SUBSTANTIVE PROOF OF THE FACTS RELATED BY THE WITNESS OR IN THE TERMS OF THE STATUTE THAT THEY WERE NOT TO CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE OF SUCH INCONSISTENT STATE MENTS EXCEPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTRADICTING THE WITNESS DURING THE CLOSING ARGUMENT FOR THE PROSECUTION CAPTAIN MI CAJAH WOODS WHO HAD ASSISTED THE PROSECUTION AROSE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY SAID TO THE COURT WITH THE GRACIOUS CONSENT OF THE GENTLEMEN ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THE COIMONWEALTHS ATTOR NEY I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE STATEMENT NOT PERTAINING TO THE MERITS OF THIS CASE BUT IN VIEW OF THE ATTACK WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SO INTENDED BUT WHICH SOUNDED TO ME UNGENEROUS AS AN UN GENEROUS ATTACK MADE UPON ME BY THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN AND WHO HAS MADE SO ABLE A SPEECH I DESIRE TO SAY THAT I REFUSED A LARGE FEE IN THIS CASE TO PROSECUTE906 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB COUNSEL FOR THE PRISONER OBJECTED TO THE STATEMENT AND ASKED THAT THE JURY BE DISCHARGED IN VIEW OF THAT STATEMENT IT APPEARS IN THE BILL OF EXCEPTIONS THAT COUNSEL FOR THE PRISONER HAD IN HIS ARGUMENT CRITICISED THE POSITION OF CAPTAIN WOODS IN ACTING AS PROSECUTOR UNDER THE COMPULSION OF PUBLIC OPINION OF A MAN HE ADMITTED HAD BEEN HIS FRIEND FOR TWENTY YEARS THE RIGHT OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR TO HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM AN ATTORNEY TO ASSIST IN THE PROSECUTION IS ESTABLISHED LAW IN THIS STATE AND IT IS NOT A PROPER SUBJECT OF ANIMADVERSION HE IS AS LAWFULLY THERE TO ASSIST THE PROSECUTION AS COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE TO DEFEND THE PRISONER AND SO LONG AS HE KEEPS WITHIN PROPER BOUNDS HE IS NOT OPEN TO CRITICISM BEFORE THE JURY IT WOULD BE A STRANGE THING IF COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED WERE PERMITTED TO CRITICISE OPPOSING COUNSEL AND THAT THE LATTER SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SUBMIT IN SILENCE UNDER THE PENALTY WE ARE ASKED TO IMPOSE IN THIS CASE THERE IS NO MERIT IN THIS EXCEPTION THE JURY HAVING RENDERED A VERDICT OF GUILTY OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE THE ACCUSED MOVED TO SET ASIDE THE VERDICT AMONG OTHER REASONS BECAUSE THE JURY WERE PERMITTED DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE TRIAL TO READ AND DID READ CERTAIN NEWSPAPERS CONTAINING REFER ENCES TO AND COMMENTS UPON THE CASE PENDING THE TRIAL OF THE SAME IT APPEARS THAT BEFORE THE JURY WAS SWORN AND IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM ONE OF THE JURORS THE COURT STATED TO THE MEMBERS OF THE JURY THAT THEY MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO READ SUCH PORTIONS OF THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS AS IN NO WAY RELATED TO THIS TRIAL BUT THAT THEY MUST SCRUPULOUSLY AVOID ANY PARTS OF SAID PAPERS AS HAD ANY REFER ENCE TO THIS TRIAL WHICH THE SAID MEMBERS OF THE JURY THEN AND THERE SEVERALLY PROMISED TO DO AND THE SERGEANTS WERE THEN INSTRUCTED TO CARRY OUT THIS INSTRUCTION OF THE COURT AT THE TIINE THIS INSTRUC TION WAS GIVEN NEITHER THE PRISONER OR HIS COUNSEL THEY BEING PRES ENT MADE OBJECTION THOUGH THEY WERE NOT ASKED BY THE COURT IF THEY HAD OBJECTION IN IULNTER V STATE 43 GA 483 AFTER SOME OF THE JURY WERE IN THE BOX BUT THE WHOLE NOT IMPANELED AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THE COURT THOSE SWORN WERE SEEN BY COUNSEL FOR ACCUSED READING A NEWS PAPER WHICH CONTAINED AN ARTICLE REFLECTING UPON THE COUNSEL FOR PRISONER AND NO MOTION OR NOTICE WAS THEN TAKEN IN REGARD THERETO IT WAS HELD THAT THIS WAS NOT SUCH IRREGULARITY UPON THE PART OF THE JURV AS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SET ASIDE THE VERDICT AND THAT SUCH1905 J SAMUEL M CUE V COMMONWEALTH 907 ACTS TRANSPIRING IN THE COURTROOM AND IN THE

AFTER HE WAS SWORN BUT BEFORE THE PANEL WAS FILLED AND AFTERWARDS ON THE TRIAL HIS ATTENTION WAS CALLED TO THE FACT THAT ANOTHER JUROR WAS READING A NEWSPAPER IN WHICH WAS AN ARTICLE PURPORTING TO CONTAIN A REPORT OF THE TRIAL AND COMMENTING UPON THE CASE UNFAVORABLY TO THE DEFENDANT AND MADE NO OBJECTION THERETO BUT STATED PRIVATELY TO THE COURT THAT IT WAS BEST TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE MATTER AS IT MIGHT GIVE THE ARTICLE UNDUE PROMINENCE AND DO THE DEFENDANT MORE HARM THAN GOOD IT NOT APPEARING THAT THE PROSECUTION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACT IT WAS HELD THAT THE IRREGULARITY WAS WAIVED AND COULD NOT BE URGED BY THE DEFENDANT AS ERROR TO REVERSE A JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION AND THAT A PRISONER ON TRIAL HAS NO RIGHT TO STAND BY AND SUFFER IRREGULAR PROCEEDINGS TO TAKE PLACE AND THEN SEEK A REVERSAL FOR THE SAME LIKE ANY OTHER DEFENDANT IF HE NEGLECTS IN PROPER TIME TO INSIST UPON HIS RIGHTS HE WAIVES THEM IN MCKINNEY V PEOPLE 2 GILM 556 IT IS SAID A PRISONER ON TRIAL UNDER OUR LAWS HAS NO RIGHT TO STAND BY AND SUFFER IRREGULAR PROCEEDINGS TO TAKE PLACE AND THEN ASK TO HAVE THE PROCEEDINGS RE VERSED ON ERROR ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH IRREGULARITIES THE LAW BY FUR NISHING HIM WITH COUNSEL TO DEFEND HIM HAS PLACED HIM ON THE SAME PLATFORM WITH ALL OTHER DEFENDANTS AND IF HE NEGLECTS IN PROPER TIME TO INSIST UPON HIS RIGHTS HE WAIVES THEM SO IT IS UNIFORMLY HELD IN CIVIL AS WELL AS IN CRIMINAL CASES FOR AS WE HAVE ALREADY REMARKED THE MODE OF PROCEDURE IS SUBSTANTIAL LY THE SAME IN BOTH A PARTY WHO STANDS BY WITHOUT OBJECTION AND SEES PROPER EVIDENCE EXCLUDED OR IMPROPER EVIDENCE ADMITTED WITH OUT OBJECTING WILL NOT BE HEARD TO MAKE THE OBJECTION AFTER VERDICT AND SO WITH INSTRUCTIONS IN OTHER WORDS LITIGANTS ARE NOT PER MITTED TO PLAY FAST AND LOOSE WITH THE COURT IF THEY ARE SILENT WHEN IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SPEAK THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO SPEAK WHEN IT IS THEIR DUTY TO BE SILENT THE CASE UNDER CONSIDERATION IS FAR STRONGER THAN THOSE CITED THE COURT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PRISONER AND OF HIS COUNSEL AT THE INSTANCE OF THE JURY PERMITTED THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO NEWSPAPERS UNDER RULES WHICH IT PRESCIIBED TT DLOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE LIMITS908 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB INMPOSED BY THE COURT WERE EXCEEDED OR THAT THE PRISONER WAS PREJU DICED BY WHAT OCCURRED BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE HE HAD NO RIGHT TO SIT MUTE PREPARED TO ABIDE BY THE RESULTS IF THEY WERE FAVORABLE OR TO MAKE OBJECTION IF THEY WERE ADVERSE WE THINK IT IS THE SAFER AND BETTER PRACTICE TO EXCLUDE NEWSPAPERS FROM THE JURY THEY ARE CALLED UPON TO EXERCISE THE MOST SACRED DUTY WHICH CAN DEVOLVE UPON A CITIZEN AND IN ITS DISCHARGE THEY MUST MAKE SUCH PERSONAL SACRIFICE AS IS NECESSARY TO ITS DUE PER FORMANCE BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE NO REVERSIBLE ERROR IS DISCLOSED IN THIS RESPECT NO ONE CAN READ THE PETITIONS FOR A WRIT OF ERROR IN THIS CASE WITH OUT BEING SATISFIED THAT THE ACCUSED HAD EVERY ADVANTAGE THAT COULD ACCRUE TO HIM FROM THE EFFORTS OF ABLE AND ASTUTE COUNSEL BUT NO ONE CAN READ THE FACTS PRESENTED IN EVIDENCE WITHOUT BEING CONVINCED THAT NO ADVOCACY HOWEVER SKILLED TO MAKE THE WORSE APPEAR THE BETTER REASON COULD HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT ANY OTHER RESULT THAN THAT WHICH HAS BEEN REACHED THE EVIDENCE PRECLUDES EVERY REASONABLE HYPOTHESIS OF INNOCENCE AND POINTS WITH UNERRING CERTAINTY TO THE GUILTY MAN THE RECORD DISCLOSES A HOMICIDE

CONTROLLED BY PRINCIPLES WELL ESTABLISHED OR COVERED BY WHAT WE HAVE SAID WITH REFERENCE TO KINDRED EXCEPTIONS AND THERE IS BUT ONE OTHER VIEW WHICH WE ARE CALLED UPON TO PRESENT RUNNING THROUGH THE PETITIONS AND MORE PARTICULARLY THE SUPPLE NENTAL PETITION THERE IS A SUBTLE SUGGESTION THAT THIS COURT HAS INTRODUCED A PRACTICE WHICH TENDS TO UNDERMINE THE RIGHTS AND ABRIDGE THE PRIVILEGES OF THOSE WHO STAND ACCUSED OF CRIME THE THEORY PROPOUNDED SEEMS TO BE THAT A WRIT OF ERROR TO THE JUDGMENT OF A TRIAL COURT IS ONE OF THE RIGHTS OF A PERSON CONVICTED OF CRIME WHILE THE TRUTH IS THAT A

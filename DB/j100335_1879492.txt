progressive person of his hamlet and we sometimes flatter ourselves that we are getting the pick of European workmen because only the most energetic and ambitious would undertake the dangers of removal to another country These figures show the contrary They show that the great bulk of our immigration consists of the people who can find no place in their own country This immense preponderance of the classes whose wages in Europe are the lowest and whose lack of acquired skill makes their securing of employ ment most difficult shows that we are getting the Europeans who cant get a foothold in their own country we are get ting what is left over after all the places in Europe are filled FRED PERRY POWERS A SUGGESTED REARRANGEMENT OF ECONOMIC STUDY It is not often that those scholars to whom the present state of economics seems quite unsatisfactory venture on an explicit statement of the manner in which improvement should take place but in the last number of the Tahrbuch fitr Gesetz gebung Dr Hasbach presents a scheme for reshaping instruc tion in economics which is tantamount to a scheme for reshaping economic science and which though not aiming to be more than tentative yet is given in such detail as to make tolerably clear the extent of the proposed departure from the beaten track The author is professor in Greifswald and has been a pupil of Professor Schmoller and Schmoller himself adds a note in which he points out wherein he agrees and wherein he does not agree with his former pupil We have therefore something like an authoritative statement of what the adherents of the more pronounced historical school wish to effect Hasbach would begin instruction in economics by a study of industry and of the technical processes of industry a study of mining fishery forestry agriculture the manufacturing arts and commerce Charts illustrations models inspection of manufacturing and other establishments should form part of the teaching which would therefore be carried on mostNOTES AND MEMORANDA 229 advantageously in towns that are near to an active and varied industrial district for instance in Bonn A previous training in natural science promotes the thoroughness of such study and the author believes that study in the RealGymnasien the nonclassical schools would form an excellent preparation for economics The next step is the study of economic history a subject which Hasbach believes to be hardly more than ex plored as yet but still affording materials for a good general presentation Then comes the study of economic theory Until the first two stages have been gone through the stu dent is not equipped for economic theory because  the theory of economics is an analysis of the economic life of the civilized peoples of our time In its domain should be placed all conclusions of a theoretic kind which the custom ary arrangement of economics in the hands of German writers puts into the fields of finance and economic policy Theory is to embrace a larger number of subjects and bring about a thorough understanding of economic life The author illus trates his meaning on this point of the enlarged scope of eco nomic theory by explaining that under the subject of ex change not only value in exchange price and money are to be handled but a detailed treatment must be given to the subjects of transportation markets and exchanges Bo5rsen weights and measures money and coinage moneyed capital and banking the function of trade and the influence of ex isting law so exact a theoretic treatment to all these topics that not a corner of economic life shall fail to be lit up Elsewhere he mentions that the question of government man agement as against private industry the economic effect of direct taxation the operation of indirect taxes are to be taken out of finance into theoretic economics He believes that with such full treatment the insignificance of the field in which deductive treatment is possible will become obvious and controversy as to methods will be heard less This would close economic study proper Apart from it but closely connected with it stand certain other subjects of which parts are now apt to be included by German writers in the strictly economic field These are first administrative law second the investigation of practical economic and social230 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS questions of importance at the time such as for our time bimetallism American competition and insurance legislation and third politics or political science In other words the student of economics would have six subjects or courses of lectures to pursue namely processes of industry economic history and economic theory in one group and administration practical economic problems and politics in another group But of these subjects oddly enough the first three are not to be taught by the professor of political economy He is to teach only two in the first group economic history and eco nomic theory while he is also to handle the practical eco nomic problems in the second group a shifting of the line of division which indicates that the attempted discrimination between economics and the related fields of administrative law and politics is not so severely Togical as it assumes to be Professor Schmoller adds a note to Hasbachs proposal expressing general agreement with it He believes that study of the processes of industry is a necessary introduction to that of economics and he says that he advises every student to attend lectures on economic history before undertaking the study of economic theory HIe acts already in the line of his pupils suggestion by not treating finance as a separate sub ject He lectures instead on general financial and adminis trative history On other points he differs He doubts the expediency of separate departments and faculties of political science the establishment of which Hasbach advocates More over he does not believe that a study of natural science is the most useful preparation for that of economics As the latter belongs to the mental sciences and its fundamental questions are historical and psychological a classical and philosophic training gives the best foundation for it There is nothing in this proposed rearrangement of a course of extended economic study which is inconsistent with the severest deductive or orthodox  treatment of the subject No one will deny the advantages of a careful description of in dustry and investigation of economic history though it may be doubted whether as much time should be given to each of these as to economic theory itself Moreover the present writer agrees that a fairly detailed analysis of what may beNOTES AND MEMORANDA 231 called the social organism forms the best introduction to eco nomic study and that treatises and textbooks would be improved if their opening chapters consisted mainly of de scriptive matter Dr Hasbach however goes too far in demanding a complete course of study on the processes of industry as indispensable to an understanding of economics Interesting and useful as such a course might be in itself much less would serve the economists purposes The general drift of the proposal however is not without support among writers who have little sympathy with the extreme historical school Professor Newcomb begins his exposition in his Principles with a book entitled Description of the Social Organism  and as was noted in the last issue of this four nal the unfinished treatise left by Professor Jevons contem plated a similar introductory part That the study of economic history should precede that of economic theory seems quite inadvisable The value of such study indeed the absolute need of it as a means of training in the application of economic principles is almost beyond dispute But it helps the student more if undertaken after a training in economic reasoning or at least side by side with it Here again however there is occasion to dissent rather as to the arrangement and sequence of study than as to the subjectmatter to be taught Doubtless a more serious difference of opinion would be brought out if Hasbach and Schmoller had stated more ex plicitly what they would include under economic theory The hints of the former indicate that theory  would include a great deal of matter which others would call descriptive such as a treatment of coinage of transportation of weights and measures Already English readers of German treatises Sch6nbergs Handbuch for instance are often at a loss to know where they are whether in the domain of economic analysis or in that of economic description and practical poli tics and this uncertainty would probably be felt still more in a treatise by Schmoller and his pupils These scholars would probably drop as completely as possible not only those pedan tic accumulations of definitions disquisitions as to what con sumption is what is production what is capital which  Vol ii p 65232 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Schmoller repudiates with a contempt not entirely without excuse but also all deductions from the play of human motives under assumed conditions not corresponding literally with the facts of industry On this point alone a real and serious dis agreement exists between the deductive economists and the advocates of exclusively historical and practical treatment Even here we cannot be sure that the disagreement is really serious for the historians never have stated explicitly how far they would go in flinging away deduced principles Very likely a treatise from them if finally worked out would show at bottom only a difference in emphasis in the degree of cor rectness ascribed to general conclusions in readiness to apply them at once to practical questions and not a substantial dis sent from the essential principles of classic political economy F W TAUSSIG

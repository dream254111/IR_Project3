DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE PROFESSOR JENNINGS AS A BIOLOGICAL PHILOS OPHER NOT for many a day according to my no tion has anything more significant taken place in the biological realm than Professor Jenningss presidential address on  Heredity and Personality before the American So ciety of Naturalists at its recent meeting SCIENCE December 29 1911 How splendid an era of biological achieve ment will have been ushered in when men of Jenningss rank shall come forth from their laboratories upon occasion and discuss with out feeling the need of apology for doing so the infinitely large as well as the infinitely small problems of our science This address augurs for Jennings as commanding a place in the larger biology as he now holds in the smaller Concerning the particular road namely that of genetics by which Professor Jen nings has come so near the edge of the woods of biological minutism I shall say little at this time Rather it is about his role as philosopher or better as metaphysician that I wish to speak In the first place I want to express my gratification at the clear evidence furnished by this address particularly that he possesses both the aptitude and the courage to be the successor of Brooks not merely as a professor of zoology but as an upholder of the rights and dignity of the philosophical side of biology In the second place I am going to claim the privilege usually accorded to senior ity of years and counsel Jennings against the supposed necessity of apologizing for the vio lation of good biological manners when he yields to his inclination to talk to fellow biol ogists on large subjects Now as to the problems raised I do not as already said propose to go far into the sub FEBRUARY 16 1912

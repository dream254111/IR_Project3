principal case there was clearly solicitation of C to commit the crime rather than an attempt by the defendant to commit embracery himself EQUITYRELIEI ON CONTRACT FOR BNEFIT Op THIRD PERSOND Union contracted with Ps predecessor to sell to the latter the entire loganberry crop of some of its members In order to secure performance of this agree ment the union entered into contracts with the several growers by which it was constituted agent to sell the crops to Ps predecessor and the growers agreed to deliver their crops to Ps predecessor Upon threatened breach of these contracts P brought a bill in equity for specific performance of the contracts and injunction against sale to others On appeal from an order sustaining the demurrer of the growers it was held that the injunction should have been granted Phez Co v Salem Fruit Union et al Ore I92I 201 Pac 222 In the instant case there are several grounds for equitable reliefchar acter of the chattels see next note avoidance of multiplicity of suits and the nature of the contract involved In regard to the last point the court says that there is respectable authority to the effect that the proper remedy for the breach of thirdparty beneficiary contracts is in equity rather than law The only authority cited is Mr Willistons very able argument in his work on CONTRACTS  358 359 in which he points out the practical advan tages of determining the entire controversy in equity However Mr Wil liston cites little authority on the subject In Peel v Peel 17 W R 586 the beneficiary was given specific performance of a contract to pay an annuity on the ground that the promisee would suffer no pecuniary damage from the breach In a subsequent English case Re Rotherham Alum  Chemical Co 25 Ch D o13 Lord Lindley said that the beneficiary has no peculiar equity No American cases seem to have passed squarely upon the subject In some jurisdictions where the beneficiary cannot sue at law in his own name he is allowed to bring a bill in equity on the theory of being subrogated to the rights of his debtor Smith v Robins I49 C C A 324 Palmer v Bray 136 Mich 85 Green v McDonald 75 Vt 93 Such cases obviously afford no authority for the principal case because Oregon permits an action at law Davidson v Madden 89 Ore 209 It will be interesting to note whether in the absence of other equitable grounds the courts will follow Mr Willis ton and the principal case EQUITYSPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OE1 CONTRACT TO SELL CHATTrESFor statement of facts see preceding note on Phez v Salem Fruit Union The doctrine is well settled that ordinarily contracts for the delivery of chattels will not be specifically enforced The reason is that money damages will usually compensate the disappointed promisee and permit him to pur chase other chattels of like kind However if the legal remedy is inade quate the contract may be specifically enforced POMEROY ON EQUITY JURIS PRUDENCE  2170 2171 Some of the reasons for the inadequacy of the legal remedy are that the chattel is unique that the supply is limited or 543MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW that the damages are conjectural In the instant case it was alleged that the total crop of loganberries was quite limited and that the berries con tracted for were essential to the carrying on of Ps canning business Thus the legal remedy appears to be entirely inadequate Like chattels could not be obtained elsewhere and ascertaining the damage would involve an inquiry into lost profits and possibly the value of Ps business In Curtice Bros Co v Catts 72 N J Eq 831 a contract to sell tomatoes was specifically enforced because of the uncertainty of the market Other examples of the enforcement of delivery of rather prosaic chattels may be found in Equitable Gas Light Co v Baltimore Coal Tar  Mfg Co 63 Md 285 coal tar Gloucester I  G Co v Russia Cement Co I54 Mass 92 fish skins Omaha Lumber Co v Cooperative Inv Co 55 Colo 17I standing timber The principal case would appear to be well within such a line of authorities EVIDENcEPROBATIv VALU oF PRESUMPTIONSIn an action to recover for baggage destroyed by fire the defendant offered in evidence rates filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission to show that the goods accepted as baggage should be classed as merchandise The court ruled that the rate schedules were not conclusive unless they were also on file in the railway office When the defendant rested he had introduced no evidence to prove this but held that since there was a penalty for failure to file the schedule of rates the presumption of innocence could be used as evidence to aid defendant in establishing the fact of the rates being filed but would not justify a directed verdict since it was opposed by the conflicting presump tion that the agent acted correctly in accepting the goods as baggage Simp son v Central Vt R Co Vt I92I 115 Atl 299 The decision is in accord with previous Vermont holdings It was held reversible error for the trial court to refuse to charge that the presumption of undue influence was to be regarded as a piece of evidence to be weighed in favor of the contestants In re Cowdrys Will 77 Vt 359 Reliance is placed on Coffin v United States 156 U S 432 which held that the pre sumption of innocence was to be considered as evidence in favor of the accused and that an instruction as to the necessity of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt was not sufficient This rule was again approved in Kirby v United States 174 U S 47 It has been held that the fact that a woman endorsed certificates of stock created a presumption that she knew their contents and the presumption stood in lieu of evidence of the fact and should be weighed against facts offered in rebuttal Williams v Vree land 244 Fed 346 But it seems that the Supreme Court earlier entertained a different opinion from that expressed in Coffin v United States supra As the presumption that public officers have done their duty like the pre sumption of innocence is undoubtedly a legal presumption but it does not supply proof of a substantive fact United States v Ross 92 U S 28I And also presumptions are indulged to supply the place of facts they are never allowed against ascertained and established facts When these appear presumptions disappear Lincoln v French Io5 U S 614 These two deci sions suggest what appears to be the more accurate and sound rulei e 544

National Child Labor Committee At the completion of seven years of work for the improvement of child labor conditions in America it is fitting that the National Child Labor Committee should present a concrete statement of its record This is important not so much in justification of the policies and expenditures of the committee in order that the public may judge whether we are worthy further support and cooperation but especially that we may estimate the extent to which the American people have awakened in opposition to this national vice in order more accurately to judge the possibilities that lie ahead When this Committee was formed seven years ago there was no accepted national standard of protection against the abuses of child exploitation The trade unions were committed to an eight hourday some of the womans clubs to the general abolition of child labor and the Socialist Party to the elimination of all chil dren under sixteen from wageearning industries But the trade union was accused of selfishness the womans clubs were charged with feminine sentiment and the Socialist Party was ignored as without power and influence The general public indeed had not awakened to a realization that such an evil existed and except for the Consumers League and a respectable number of enlightened individuals child labor in America may be said to have been without an enemy We were chiefly interested in the subject as an academic theme enabling the eloquent portrayal of the greed and cruelty of European civilizations Then rapidly as public intelligence and interest are wont to grow there swept over the face of the country the exciting news that child labor existed in America that the coal mines glass fac tories cotton and silk mills cigar and cigarette factories and even our public streets were the scenes of hardship danger and oppres sion to the tender bodies and souls of little boys and girls At this point a group of the more calm and discerning of those who were 31The Annals of the American Academy horrified by the evil decided to band themselves together for the purpose of conserving this public interest and seeking to direct it into definite channels of activity in order that the sentiment against child labor should not spend its force in futile denunciation but should realize improvement through definite results And it is to the credit of the South a tribute which we gladly pay that the initial suggestion of such a militant band on a national scale originated with a citizen of your own commonwealth After a struggle with the mercenary elements of Alabama to wrest from their control the lives of hundreds of little children and to secure to them the opportunities which childhood may fairly claim it seemed to Mr Edgar Gardner Murphy who led the fight that an interchange of thought and experience among citizens of the various commonwealths would so unite and direct the work of reform as to hasten the day of child freedom From a membership of less than fifty people the Committee has grown in seven years to a contributing membership of more than 5ooo who cover an annual budget of nearly 6000o Twenty seven state and local committees are affiliated and the Committee is in definite cooperation with educators medical experts jurists reform agencies relief societies womans clubs trade unions manu facturers organizations churches and all agencies working for the protection of child life While we do not look upon the enactment of child labor laws as more important than their enforcement or than the constructive policies which seek to provide the child excluded from prohibited industries the physical mental and moral opportunities needed to develop efficient citizenship yet the changes secured in child labor laws within the past seven years will perhaps measure more ac curately than anything else the extent to which the public is awake to the importance of safeguarding the child Standards of Protection Before recording these specific results however we need to state briefly the standards aimed atthe principles upon which adequate laws for such protection seem to us to be based The word child covers so wide a span in human life we recognize that some children should not be employed at all while others may wisely contribute to their own support and to social wealth Obvi 32Seven Years of Child Labor Reform ously no child should be subjected to industrial burdens too heavy either because of youth or because of physical or mental weakness also obviously in seeking legislation to protect such children some arbitrary line must be drawn Without entering into detail we may note that the recognized standard of all civilized nations ex cludes the child under fourteen years from the field of competitive industry This we have adopted as a minimum standard below which no community alert to its larger interest can afford toY fall We recognize that such an age test is arbitrary that some children are more advanced than others and we welcome all results of physiological investigations which may fix more accurate and scien tific standards But for the present we are safe since this point in age is intended to apply to the most advanced while those who fall below either as to physical or mental growth are to be still further safeguarded until sufficiently developed to venture upon the mini mum industrial hazard The other classes of children for whose employment regulation rather than prohibition is sought are those between fourteen and twentyone years of age The state is the natural guardian and protector of all minor children and it is our contention that the labor of all minors should be regulated in harmony with principles that conserve individual and social interests To illustrate our Federal Government is on record in favor of a maximum eighthour day for men in government contracts and many other lines of Federal activity Similarly many states have established the eighthour day both in relation to state con tracts and the treatment of convicts in penitentiaries and reforma tories Recent utterances from high medical authority testify to the danger especially to women from the toxin of fatigue Obviously a day long enough for adult men and women is not too short for undeveloped children We therefore seek to establish as rapidly as possible a maximum of eight hours in the daily labor of children in manufacturing and mercantile pursuits It is also the prevailing testimony of medical authorities that hard work is more injurious by night than by day Practically every physician will unhesitatingly affirm that during youth and adolescence the human life shQuld be protected through regular hours of rest recreation and feeding and we therefore contend that children under sixteen years of age should be prohibited from such occupations as demand their service at night 33The Annals of the American Academy Industrial Hazards Statisticians everywhere recognize a certain hazard in indus try and a body of legislation is being created in this country for the purpose of laying upon society and upon the industries involved a larger share of the burden which now falls so heavily upon those injured in mines factories workshops and transportation opera tions The principle of social responsibility already fairly recog nized is especially applicable to children Not only are children less intelligent less cautious and less able to defend their own rights but their physical inferiority subjects them to dangers which do not threaten the adult Reports from the few states which have taken the matter of child exposure in industry seriously enough to report upon it indicate that children sixteen years of age and under are injured or killed at a ratio startlingly higher than are adults in the same industries The percentages run from 250 in one state to 450 in another We acknowledge that statistical reports are meager and that many sections of the country are entirely devoid of this infor mation However we have considered it important that a committee formed to protect the interests of working children should not wait until a complete body of statistics had been gathered but should at once attempt to correct an abuse which obviously threatens the safety of the young Therefore leaving to statistical experts and medical scientists the more satisfying work of determining the exact extent of accidents to working children we have set ourselves to the humbler task of arousing public interest and securing legisla tion against this sacrifice on the assumption that children are un safe industrial risks and that child labor in certain specific danger ous occupations may without injury to society be suspended to the age of sixteen eighteen or even twentyone We shall not enter into the more distinctly technical phases of the problem of child labor legislation but it should not be over looked that laws which seek to establish protection for children must provide methods and machinery for administration so as to dignify the legislation by serious attention to its operation Factory inspection departments birth registration a system of certification which shall prove beyond question the age and development of the child in question are all matters claiming serious attention 34Seven Years of Child Labor Reform Summary of Legislation Measured by the foregoing the outline of achievements of the American people in developing legislation to protect the work ing child may be seen at a glance by the following schedules I During seven years five states passed their first law upon this subject Delaware Florida Georgia Mississippi Oklahoma and the District of Columbia 2 The eighthour day has been established in Ohio Illinois Indiana Nebraska New York Wisconsin Colorado Oklahoma North Dakota Kansas and the District of Columbia 3 Night work under sixteen years has been made illegal in Alabama California Delaware Idaho Indiana Iowa Kansas Ken tucky Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Nebraska New Jersey North Dakota Oklahoma Rhode Island South Carolina Vermont Washington and the District of Columbia 4 A fourteenyearage limit as the minimum for employment in industry has been established in the following states California Colorado Delaware Idaho Iowa Kentucky Louisiana Maine Missouri Nebraska Pennsylvania North Dakota New Jersey Ten nessee West Virginia Rhode Island Kansas and the District of Columbia 5 Departments of factory inspection have been established in Alabama Colorado Delaware Kansas Louisiana Maryland North Dakota Oklahoma South Carolina Texas Tennessee Vir ginia and the District of Columbia 6 Methods of proving the age of children seeking employ ment have been provided in the following California Iowa Kan sas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Michigan Missouri Nebraska North Dakota Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island Washington Wisconsin and the District of Columbia Meantime compulsory education laws have been enacted or improved in a large number of states Serious Defects It might appear from this record that so much has been accom plished the public could reasonably rest We are apt to forget how large a country we have There are still seven of our states which have not yet reached the fourteenyearage limit even for employ 35The Annals of the American Academy ment in factories These states are North Carolina Maryland Alabama Florida Georgia Mississippi South Carolina Alabama Florida Maryland North Carolina North Dakota Pennsylvania South Carolina Virginia permit the employment of boys of twelve years in mines Children under sixteen are still permitted to work at night in Arizona Colorado Connecticut Delaware Maine Maryland Mon tana Nevada New Hampshire South Dakota Tennessee Utah West Virginia and Wyoming There are thirtyfive states in the Union in which children under sixteen years of age may work more than eight hours a day Recently there has been widespread complaint against confinement of children in poorly ventilated school rooms where they spend the day in physical inactivity Rapid improvement is coming in our schools through open air class rooms and the development of manual arts so that the evil complained of is decreasing but if confinement in a school room is injurious what shall be said of the factory where frequently the labor of the child also compels physical inaction at the almost automatic machine Under the most objectionable conditions the child is confined in school I000 hours annually In Massachusetts the factory child is confined 2912 hours a year and in New York where the eighthour day prevails he is subjected to 2496 hours confinement In Alabama a child of twelve years may legally work 320o hours a year or more than three times as many hours as he can be confined in school in states having the nine or ten months school year while children of four teen years may be employed seventyeight hours a week or 4056 hours a year The total number of hours of daylight in the year exclusive of Sundays is 3744 so that the manufacturing industries of this state may legally employ their fourteenyearold children 312 hours of the night beside all the hours of daylight In twentythree of our states there is up to the present time no method of determining how old the children are who seek work in our industries Our agents have frequently found eight nine and tenyearold boys applying for work in glass factories or coal mines upon affidavits certifying them to be fourteen or sixteen years of age In all these efforts at reform we must keep in mind the honor and dignity of our social institutions and nothing is more fatal to the integrity of the American people than contempt for its 36Seven Years of Child Labor Reform own laws When by the very nature of the problem we lay upon the ignorant impoverished or greedy parent the temptation to de ceive in order to secure employment for a child we are guilty of placing the burden on the weak where it does not belong and promoting perjury by process of law The states in which we do not require any proof of the childs age or at least any proof worthy the name are Colorado Florida Louisiana Nevada South Dakota Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Wyoming Alabama Arkansas Delaware Georgia Idaho Indiana Missouri Mississippi New Hampshire North Carolina South Carolina and Tennessee It is necessary that the laws to which we have referred shall be in charge of public officials clothed with adequate authority to enforce them At present Arkansas Florida Georgia Nevada North Carolina Utah and Wyoming have no department entrusted with this duty while the factory inspector in Missouri has jurisdic tion only in the large cities the factory inspector in Louisiana only in the Parish of New Orleans the factory inspector in Alabama is also required to visit and report on jails and almshouses and the Governor of South Carolina has within two weeks vetoed the appro priation made by the legislature for the two factory inspectors who during the past two years have assisted the Commissioner of Labor in laying the foundation of this branch of public service It will be recognized from the foregoing tables that the problem of bringing the states of this Union up to a reasonable standard of child protection is complicated and difficult It will be seen also that the lower standards as to age hours of labor and methods of enforcing the law are with few exceptions much inferior in the South to the standards attained in Northern and Western States And while we of the North with shame confess that the extent of child labor in our great industrial communities overshadows child labor of the South the phenomenal industrial development in many of your Southern sections indicates that the time is near at hand when the South will rival the older industrial communities in the extent of manufacturing and commercial operations and that unless the South speedily improves the laws now upon her statute books the curse of child labor will rest more heavily upon her communities than upon others We believe the record of the past seven years gives promise 3738 The Annals of the American Academy that the American people are ready to rally to the establishment of laws which throughout the nation shall guarantee to every child an adequate opportunity to play and grow and learn and that we shall soon permit ourselves to be brought among those nations truly civilized that recognize in their childlife the most valuable asset among all their treasures To the realization of this high standard the National Child Labor Committee is committed and confidently solicits the cooperation of all who believe in lifting from the bent shoulders of the little child the burdens that now crush him

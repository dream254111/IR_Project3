noticed errors in the statement of the number of images in a couple of text books I have recently made a canvass of fortyone books on optics or general physics and was surprised to find a general lack of in formation on this subject Fifteen of the books did not consider it at all many of the others took up only special cases where the an gle is 60 or 90 and eight contained mis statements as to the number of images It does not seem to be generally recognized that the number of possible images depends upon the position of the object and that the num ber of these which are visible depends upon the position of the observers eye As in only five of the fortyone books examined was the dependence of the number of images upon the position of the object correctly stated I have thought it well to write out the following analysis FIG 1 Let  be the angle between the mirrors a the angular distance of the object Po from one of them P1 P etc the images formed by first reflection in the latter P P etc the images formed by first reflection in the other mirror Then if n be a whole number the an gular distance from P0 to any image may ba stated as follows P2n P2n l 1 p2n p2n  1 2np 2nb  2a 2np 2np  2  a If the pth image fall behind both mirrors in set P2 r   a 2n  7r  a in set P21 7r a 2n0 2ar  a or 7r a 2n 1 r a These conditions are the same and may be written 7r   a pp  7a or where the equality sign is brought in so that p may represent the number of images in this set as well when the last one falls on the line of one of the mirrors Similarly if the rth image fall behind both mirrors in set p2n 7r  a  2nr r   a in set P2n  r  p  a 2n  2   a  7  a or r  a 2n  1  r  a Hence r a  a r 1 and the total number of images k pr If  divide evenly into r pr 7r and the last images of the two sets coincide Then 2r kpr1 1 and k is independent of a This much is correctly worked out in Violle Heath and several smaller works on optics but in no text on general physics in English that I have seen If the eye be behind the plane of one mirror only the images finally formed by the other are visible If the eye be between the mirrors angularly all the images formed in front of either mirror are visible An image behind both mirrors will be visible only to an eye between the mirrors whose position makes an angle less than r  8 with the surface in which the last reflection takes place where 0 is the angle between this surface and the position of the image considered 316SCIENCE A few examples may make the subject more clear If  72 a 36then p 2 r 2 k 4 and all the images are visible to an eye any where between the two mirrors If 72 o a  10 p 3 r  2 k 5 but only three of the five images will be visible to an eye placed within 25 of the mirror furthest from P0 If p55 a250 p 3r3 k6 If  55 a 10 p 4 r3 k7 If the eye be placed within the angle Ai only five of the seven images are visible This is the case shown in the figure It is interesting to observe the results ex perimentally and see one of the images dis appear or merge into another at critical angles For p 55 a critical case is given by a 15 IMORTON GITHENS LLOYD RANDAL MORGAN LABORATORY OF PHYSICS UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THE PLANET EROS TIE planet Eros as we noted last week was rediscovered on the morning of August 2 by Dr Chas J Ling with the twenty inch re fractor of the Chamberlin Observatory at Uni versity Park Colo It was found pretty close to the place derived from an ephemeris com puted by Miss Mary Clark Traylor But it was estimated to be considerably brighter than had been expected In view of the fact that the law of its variability is unknown the re sults of photometric measures will be awaited with interest As Eros is now low in the east when the morning twilight begins and is ad vancing in right ascension nearly as fast as the sun it will not be an easy object for some months to come The position on August 11 at 15h 25m 19s Univ Park M T was AR 5h 36m 3503s Decl 310 56 177 THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY AND THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION AT a meeting of the corporation of the Ma rine Biological Laboratory held at Woods 317 Hole on August 12 it was voted to transfer the laboratory and its equipment to the Car negie Institution This action was taken after it had been stated to the members of the cor poration that the executive committee of the Carnegie Institution would recommend to the trustees that the laboratory should be accepted that its debts should be paid that new build ings should be erected that 20000 a year should be allowed for maintenance and that the scientific management should rest as here tofore with the naturalists of the country A motion that a three fourths vote of the mem bers present be required for the transfer of the property of the corporation was defeated by a vote of 32 to 19 It was voted without dissent that an account of the action of the corporation be made public SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS DR N L BRITTON sailed for England on August 16 where he will complete some in vestigations upon American Carices and Cras sulacece which will be issued as the first parts of the Systematic Botany of North America to be published by the New York Botanical Garden Dr MacDougal will be acting direc tor of the garden during his absence PROFESSOR J E WOLFF of the U S Geolog ical Survey is continuing the investigation of the areal and structural geology in the crystal line areas of New Jersey in cooperation with the state geologist DR ROBERT BELL of the Geological Survey of Canada has been engaged in the geological survey of Baffin Land which he finds to have an area of about 300000 square miles making it the largest island with the exception of Aus tralia and Greenland The results of Dr Bells explorations are to be presented to the Royal Geographical Society MR BORCHGREVINK the Norwegian explorer has taken out naturalization papers so as to Americanize the Antarctic expedition he is planning under the auspices of the National Geographical Society MEDICAL exchanges state that the committee of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine is making arrangements to enable Major Ron AUGUST 22 1902

enactment of N Y Civ Code  66 as now contained in the Judiciary Law N Y Consol Laws c 30 Laws of 1909 c 35  475 providing that the attorneys lien should attach to clients cause of action even before judgment and prevent a settlement before or after judgment to the prejudice of the lien offered an opportunity for the revival of the opposite view The act without apparent justification was interpreted as making an attorney an equi table assignee of his clients claim and for that reason superior to any right of setoff Smith v Cayuga Lake Cement Co 1905 107 App Div 524 95 N Y Supp 236 It would appear that this result is due rather to the inclination of the court than to the effect of the statute This may be inferred from the fact that although the lien of the defendants attorney who sets up no counterclaim is without the purview of the statute and can still be cut off by a settlement before judgment Saranac and Lake Placid R R v Alrnold 1902 37 Misc 514 75 N Y Supp 1003 affd 72 App Div 620 76 N  Supp 1032 nevertheless when a judgment for costs is obtained in such an action the attorneys lien a simple common law right is no longer subject to the right of setoff Agricultural Insurance Co v Smit7t 1906 112 App Div 840 98 N Y Supp 347 The principal case is a decision of New Yorks highest court and overrules the older doctrine of Nicol v Nicol supra which has been the basis of law in many jurisdictions holding the right of setoff superior BANKRUPTOYPROVABLE CLAIMSUNLIQUIDATED TORTParagraph a  63 of the Bankruptcy Act 1898 30 Stat 562 U S Comp Stat 1916  9647 eumerates the debts which are provable against the bank rupts estate but makes no mention of unliquidated tort claims Para graph b declares that unliquidated claims may be liquidated pursuant to an application to the court Held that the sole purpose of para graph b is to permit unliquidated claims coming within the provisions of paragraph a to be liquidated as the court shall direct and that neither paragraph authorizes proof of unliquidated demands against the bank rupt for fraud and deceit notwithstanding  17 of the Act as amended by Act of February 5 1903 32 Stat 798 U S Comp Stat 1916  9601 providing that a discharge shall release a bankrupt from all his provable debts except such as are liabilities for frauds etc Schall v Camors 1920 40 Sup Ot 135 While the liquidation of unliquidated claims is provided for under  63 b of the Act there has been some doubt as to the kind of claims referred to It was held that paragraph b merely provided a procedure for the liquidation of the class of claims covered by paragraph a and that therefore tort claims including fraud not being within para graph a were not provable See Dunbar v Dunbar 1903 190 U S 340 350 23 Sup Ct 757 It has been argued however that  17 must be read in conjunction with  63 and that a discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts except such as  are liabilities for obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations implies that a claim for fraud is a provable debt See Clarke v Rogers 1913 228 U S 534 33 Sup Ct 587 This question was regarded as open as recently as 1904 See Crawford v Burke 1904 195 U S 176 187 25 Sup Ot 9 But since that time there has been an unbroken line of authorities recognizing the inter 481COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW pretation that claims based solely upon torts are not provable under  63 In re New York Tunnel Co C 0 A 1908 159 Fed 688 In re Southern Steel Co D 0 1910 183 Fed 498 and that  17 does not enlarge the class of provable claims but purports merely to specifically except certain tort claims from destruction by a discharge In re New York Tunnel Co supra The want of harmony between  17 and  63 has been specifically recognized and  63 which is devoted solely to declaring what debts are provable has been held controlling Brown  Adams v United Button Co 0 0 A 1906 149 Fed 48 53 Nat urally where the creditor can waive the tort claim and sue in contract or quasicontract the claim may be liquidated and proved under  63 a and b Reynolds v New York Trust Co C C A 1911 188 Fed 611 notwithstanding the fact that the claim has been prosecuted in tort Crawford v Burke supra The instant case the first to squarely raise the issue before the Supreme Court is in line with the great weight of authority in the lower courts BANKRUPTCYREFEREES JURISDIOTIONA creditor entered a claim against a bankrupt estate for something over 6600 The claim was allowed but the trustee counterclaimed for 43700 Over the insistent objection of the creditor the referee proceeded to a hearing upon the merits of the counterclaim and thereafter entered an order adjudging the creditor to be indebted to the estate in the amount of 37080 being the difference between the trustees counterclaim and the creditors claim Held a referee is without jurisdiction over the objection of a creditor to make a finding of the amount due from him to the bank rupt estate in excess of his claim against the estate In re Continental Producing Co D 0 So Distr California 1919 261 Fed 627 Under  2 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 30 Stat 545 U S Comp Stat 1916  9586 the district courts have jurisdiction over proceedings to allow or disallow claims in bankruptcy But except in a few cases specifically mentioned in the statute they have not jurisdiction over suits instituted by the trustee unless they would have had jurisdiction irrespective of the bankruptcy or unless the defendant consents Sec 23b 30 Stat 552 U S Comp Stat 1916  9607 as amended in 1903 32 Stat 798 and 1910 36 Stat 840 In the instant case the consent of the defendant was lacking and it does not appear that the court had jurisdiction on any other grounds But it is extremely doubtful whether even if the defendants consent had given the district court jurisdiction it could have been delegated to a referee In one of the exceptional cases under  23b above referred to although it was provided that suits by the trustee to set aside transfers under certain conditions might be brought either in any court of bank ruptcy or in the court in which the bankrupt might have brought such an action if there were no bankruptcy the referee was held not to constitute a court of bankruptcy within the meaning of the section In re Overholzer 1909 23 A B R 10 Brandenburg Bankruptcy 4th ed 330 contra Matter of OBrien 1908 21 A B R 11 This special and extended jurisdiction of the district courts having been denied to the referee under one clause of  23b it might be analogically reasoned that it would be denied under another clause of the same section and that even though the defendant had consented in the instant case the referee would not have had jurisdiction On the above two grounds the conclusion of the court is sound 482

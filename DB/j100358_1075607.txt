Hotel Chicago Friday and THE NORTH Saturday March 23 and 24 The attendance was representative CENTRAL and the program unusually interesting Inasmuch as the associ AssoCIATION ation publishes its own proceedings the School Review limits itself to a brief account of the meeting The first session of the meeting was held on Friday morning After a gracious address by the president of the association President George E MacLean of the University of Iowa reports were made by the treasurer the executive committee the committee on athletics and the delegate to the College Entrance Examina tion Board The paper of the session was presented by Principal George W Benton of the Shortridge High School Indianapolis answering the question  What the Colleges Can Do to Assist the High Schools in More Nearly Satis fying the Demands of the Public The lateness of the hour prevented the paper from receiving the discussion it deserved The program of the afternoon session consisted of a discussion a paper and two reports The discussion was on the topic Are State Boards of Medical Examiners Justified in Excluding from Examinations the Graduates of Medical Colleges That Allow Advanced Credit for Work Done in a College of Liberal Arts   The leaders of the discussion were Dr Frank Billings of the University of Chicago and Dean J H T Main of Iowa College While the topic is one that concerns the relation of the colleges to the professional schools it may be of interest to note that the general tendency of the discussion was toward the recognition of work wherever done provided the quality and quantity were unquestioned Director George N Carman of the Lewis Institute presented a paper on  The Inspection and Accrediting of Colleges and Universities The accrediting of schools is a subject that has received careful consideration from the association Plans and methods for doing this important work have been adopted and put into operation by the association The commission on accred ited schools has found it impracticable to stop with the consideration of the schools but has been compelled to consider the character of the colleges as well A large number of subjects required by the colleges for graduation are offered both in the college and in the school the college accepting the work when well done from either institution The improvement in instruction and equipment in the better secondary schools has brought these schools to a point where they may well ask whether all colleges in the territory are doing equally good work in the subjects taught by both It is but fair therefore to raise the 382EDITORIAL NOTES 383 question of the advisability of extending the work of the commission to include the inspection and accrediting of colleges The association referred the question raised by the paper to the commission for further consideration and report The session of Saturday morning was devoted to a discussion of the subject To What Extent and by What Methods Should FirstYear Students in Colleges and Secondary Schools be Supervised Dean Thomas A Clark of the University of Illinois presented a thoroughgoing and helpful paper on the sub ject and was followed by Principal George E Marshall of the Sioux City High School Chancellor Winfield S Chaplin of Washington University St Louis and Principal Frank B Pearson of the East High School Columbus All the speakers were of the opinion that these critical firstyears should receive increased attention from the colleges and schools All emphasized the need of the personal element in dealing with the students and recognized how rare the man is who has both the talent for and interest in this important work An important con sideration hardly raised in the discussion is how far the organization and method of education in the lower schools are responsible for the inability of the students to meet the critical tests of change from one school to another With the election of officers the program of the meeting was brought to a successful close By a recent vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Harvard University the instructors in education have been constituted a Division of Education  THE HARVARD of coordinate rank with other divisions of the faculty Hereto DEPARTMENT OF fore the instructors in education have been affiliated with the EDUCATION Division of Philosophy Besides assigning to education its appropriate place among other university studies this vote evidently indicates that Harvard University intends to develop the study of education and the pro fessional training of collegebred teachers as rapidly and as comprehensively as its resources permit Just as we go to press we are notified that the Executive Committee of the National Educational Association have decided

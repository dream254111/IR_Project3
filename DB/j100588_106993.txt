PETER ELMLY PRINTER TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY MDCCXCV C iii 2 ADVERTISEMENT THE Committee appointed by the Rqyal Society to direct the pub lication of the Philosophical Transactions take this opportunity to acquaint the Public that it fully appears as wellfromthe council books and journals of the Society as fiom repeated declarations which have been made in several former Transactions that the printing of them was always from time to time the single act of the respective Secretaries till the Fortyseventh Volume the Society as a Body never interesting themselves any further in their publication than by occasionally recommending the revival of them to some of their Se cretaries when from the particular circumstances of their affairs the Transactions had happened for any length of time to be intermitted And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy the Public that their usual meetings were then continued for the im provement of knowledge and benefit of mankind the great ends of their first institution by the Royal Charters and which they have ever since steadily pursued But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged and their com munications more numerous it was thought advisable that a Com mittee of their members should be appointed to reconsider the papers read before them and select out of them such as they should judge most proper for publication in the future Tfransactions which was accordingly done upon the 26th of March 1752 And the grounds A 2Ei V I of their choice are and will continue to be the importance and sin gularity of the subjects or the advantageous manner of treating them without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts or pro priety of the reasonings contained in the several papers so published which must still rest on the credit or judgment of their respective authors It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark that it is an esta blished rule of the Society to which they will always adhere never to give their opinion as a Body upon any subject either of Nature or Art that comes before them And therefore the thanks which are frequently proposed from the Chair to be given to the authors of such papers as are read at their accustomed meetings or to the persons through whose hands they receive themn are to be considered in no other light than as a matter of civility in return for the respect shewn to the So ciety by those communications The like also is to be said with re gard to the several projects inventions and curiosities of various kinds which are often exhibited to the Society the authors whereof or those who exhibit them frequently take the liberty to report and even to certify in the public newspapers that they have met with the highest applause and approbation And therefore it is hoped that no regard will hereafter be paid to such reports and public notices which in some instances have been too lightly credited to the dishonour of the SocietyCONTENTS I THIE Croonian Lecture on Muscular Motion By Everardt Home Esq F R S page 1 II Some Particulars in the Anatomy of a Whale By Mr John Abernethy Communicated by Everard Home Esq F R S

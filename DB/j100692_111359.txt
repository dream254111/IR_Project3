15 1857 Abstract On the 6th of June 1856 certain views were advaniced by one of us on the origin of slaty cleavage and soon afterwards his attention was drawn by the other to the observations of Prof J D Forbes on the structure of glacier ice as suiggesting the idea that the ice structure might be due to the same cause as the slate cleavage On consulting the observations referred to the lecturer at once perceived the proba bility of the surmise and the consequence was a joint visit for a few days to the glaciers of Grindelwald the Rholle and the Aar The subject being a physical one it was followed up by the physicist on his return from the Continenlt Reading reflection and experiment extended the inquiry until it embraced the main divisions of the problem of glacial structure and motion and the paper now sub mitted to the Society contains an account of the investigation The first division is devoted to the consideration of certain phe nomena connected with the motion of glaciers The power of gla ciers to accommodate themselves to the sinuosities of the valleys which they occupy and the resemblance of their motion through such valleys to the motion of a river suggest ideas which find their clearest expression in the viscous theory of glacier motion pro pounded by Prof J D Forbes Numerous appearances indeed seem to favour this notion The aspect of many glaciers as a whole their power of closing up crevasses and of reconstructing themselves after having been precipitated down glacial gorges the bendings and contortions of the ice the quicker movement of the central portion of the glacier where it is uninfluenced by the retardation of the banksare all circumstalnces which have been urged with such ability as to leave the viscous theory without any formidable com petitor at present To these may be added the support which the theory derived from its apparent competency to explain the laminar structure of the icea structure which it is affirmed is impossible of explanation upon any other hypothesis332 Nevertheless this theory is so directly opposed to our ordinary experience of the nature of ice as to leave a lingering doubt of its truth upon the mind To remove this doubt it is urged that the true nature of ice is to be inferred from experiments on large masses and that such experiments place the viscosity of ice in the position of a fact rather than in that of a theory It lhas never been ima gined that the bendiligs alnd contortions and other evidences of apparent viscosity exhibited by a glacier couild be made manifest on hand specimens of ice In the present paper however this is shown to be possible Spheres of ice are described as being flattened into cakes and squieezed into tranisparent lenses A straight prism of ice six inches long is described as having been passed through a series of moulds augmenting in curvature and finally coming out bent into a semiring A piece of ice is placed in a hemispherical cavity and is pressed upon by a protuberance not large einough to fill the cavity and is thus squeezed into a cup In short every observation made upon glaciers and adduced by writers upon tlhe subject in proof of the plasticity of ice is slhown to be capable of perfect imitation with hand specimens in the laboratory These experimenits then demonstrate a capacity on the part of small masses of ice which has hitherto been denied to them by writers upon this subject They prove to all appearance that the substance is even much more plastic thani it has hitherto been sup posed to be but the real germ from which these results have sprung is to be found in a lecture given by Mr Faraday at the Royal Institu tion in 1850 and reported in the Athenlium and Literary Gazette for that year Mr Faraday then showed that when two pieces of ice at a temperature of 320 Fahr are placed in contact they freeze together by the conversion of the film of moisture between them into ice The case of a snowball was referred to as a familiar illustration of the principle when the snow is below 320 and therefore dry it will not cohere whereas wheni it is in a thawing condition it can be squeezed into a hard compact mass During one of the hottest days of last July when the temperature was upwards of 1000 Fahr in the sun and more than 80 in the slhade a number of pieces of ice placed loosely together in a window in the Strand were observed by one of us to be frozen together and he subsequently caused pieces of ice to freeze together under hot water Ilence the thought arose333 that if a piece of ice a straight prism for example were placed in a bent mould and submitted to pressure it would break but the continuance of the force would bring its severed surfaces to reunite and that thus the continuity of the mass might be reestablished Experiment as we have seen completely confirmed this surmise the ice passed from a continuous straight bar to a continuous bent one the transition being effected not by a viscous yielding of the particles but through fracture and eyelation All the phenomena on which the idea of viscosity has been founded are brought by experiments similar to the above into har mony with the demonistrable properties of ice In virtue of these properties the glacier accommodates itself to its bed crevasses are closed up and the broken ice of a cascade such as that of the Taliefre or the Rhone is recompacted to a solid continuous mass But if the glacier effects its movement in virtue of the incessant fracture and regelation of its parts this process will in all probability be accompanied by an audible cracking of the mass and thus a noise of decrepitation may be expected to be heard which would be absent if the motion were that of a viscous body It is well known that such noises are heard and they thus receive a satisfactory explanation   It is manifest that the continuity of the fractured ice cannot be completely and immediately reestablished after rupture it is not the same surfaces that are regelated and hence the new contact cannot be perfect throughout After rup ture the surfaces of fracture will enclose for a time capillaryfissures and thus the above theory is in harmony with the known structure of glacier ice Since the paper was presented to the Society I on Janiuary 30th made the following experi ments bearing upon this pointA piece of ordinary ice was taken and a cavity hollowed in it was filled with an infusion of cochineal the ice was perfectly impervious to the liquid which remained in it for half an hour without pene trating it in the slightest degree A piece of the same ice was subjected to a gradually increasing pressure Flashes of light were seen to issue from it at intervals which indicated tlle rupture of optical continuity and a low and in some instances almost musical crackling was heard at the same time Relieved from the pressure the ice appeared continuous to the naked eye but a cavity being formed and the cochineal infusion placed within it the coloured liquid immediately diffused itself through the capillary fissures producing an appear ance accurately resembling the drawings illustrative of the infiltration experi ments of M Agassiz on the glacier of the Aar To accouint for a  bruit de crHpitation  heard uipon the Aar glacier M Agassiz334 The next division of the paper treats of the reined or laminar structure of glacier ice which Prof J D Forbes in his earlier writings compared to slaty cleavage His theory of the structure is perhaps the only one wlhich has made any profound impression and it may be briefly stated as follows Owing to the quicker flow of the centre of a glacier a sliding of the particles of ice past each other takes place in consequence of this sliding fissures are produced which when filled with water and frozen in winter pro duce the blue veins of the glacier To account for the obliquity of the veins to the sides of the glacier a drag towards the centre is supposed to take place producing a differential motion which results in the formation of fissures But at the centre of the glacier this drag towards it cannot be suxpposed to exist and to accounit for the veined or laminated structure of the centre which under normal conditions is transverse to the length of the glacier it is supposed that the thrust behind meeting an enormous resistance in front pro duces a differential motion in a direction approximating to the verti cal and that in consequence of this motion fissures are produced which when filled and frozen produce as in the other cases the blue veins In the present paper it is observed that the onlyfact connected with this theory is that of differential motion in the direc tion of the length of the glacier Beyond this all is conjecture It refers to an observation which might be made on a fine day in summer and which would show the air within the glacier ice escaping from its surface M Agassiz supposes the ice to be diathermanous and that thus the sunbeams get through it and heat the airbubbles which it encloses causing the air to expand rupture the ice and escape in the manner observed The observation is an interesting one whatever difficulty we may find in the explanation An experi ment made today January 31 appears to me to account for the observation in a satisfactory manner Snow having fallen I was early at work compressing it and on removing a plate of it from the press I noticed as the surface melted a sparkling motion produced by the escape of the air enclosed within the mass To imitate the action of the sun upon the glacier an iron spatula was heated and on bringing it near the surface of the compressed snow the jumping of the surface caused by the issue of air through the film of water which covered it was greatly augmented On removing the spatula the motion subsided To a similar action on the part of the sun melting the surface of the glacier and thus liberating by degrees the airbubbles with which the ice is filled the observation of M Agassiz is in all probability to be referredJ T335 is by no means established that the cold of winter can reach to depths sufficierLt to produce the blue veins which are affirmed to be a portion  of the inmost structure of the glacier Again the lamina tion in some cases presents itself in the form of transparent lenticular masses imbedded in the general substance of the white ice The differential motion referred to would be mechanically inadequate to produce detached cavities corresponding to these masses which vary greatly in size and in some cases accurately resemble the greenish spots seen in slate rock when a section perpendicular to the cleavage is exposed Further as the fissures are produced by the motion of the glacier and as this motion takes place both in summer and winter it is to be inferred that they are formed at both seasons of the year But if formed in winter they cannot be filled and frozen that season for want of water and if formed in summer they cannot be frozen while summer continues for want of cold Hence at the end of each summer there ought if the above theory be correct to be a whole years unfrozen fissures in the ice Such fissures could not possibly escape observation if they existed but they never have been observed hence it is inferred that they have no existence With regard to the drag towards the centre of the glacier it is observed that if such a drag existed the centre would ultimately absorb the sides unless the loss were made good by a motion in some part of the glacier from the centre towards the sides which would be in opposition to the theory Experiments are described which prove that no such drag exists and the actual motion observed is reduced to its elementary mechanical principles With regard to the transverse lamination at the centre of the glacier the hypothesis involves among others the difficulty of supposing that fissures can be formed in a mass assumed to be viscous at right angles to the direction of an enormous pressure to which the mass is subjected An attempt is next made to apply the theory of slaty cleavage propounded by one of the authors to the laminated structure of glacier ice It is shown that this lamination like that of slate rock is always approximately at right angles to the direction of maximum pressure that local circumstances which give rise to a violent thrust produce at the same time a highly developed lamination When two confluent glaciers unite to form a single trunk the effect336 of their mutual thrust is to develope the veined structure along their line of junctioni This is illustrated in the case of the Aar and other glaciers and experiments are described which show the mechanical condition of such glaciers and that the veined structure of the ice which sometimes rises to a case of  true cleavage occurs at the precise places where the compression theory would lead one to expect it The lenticular structuLre before referred to the obliquity of the veins to the sides of the glacier the transverse laminationi at the centre the relation of the blue bands to the crevasses are all in perfect harmony with this theory Indeed unless we suppose the ice of glaciers to be perfectlv homogeneous mechanically speaking we must infer that iinner pressure some portions will be rendered more compact than others and the veined structuire is the natural consequence  Finally the wellkniown phenomenon of dirtbands upon the surfaces of glaciers is considered and an explanation of those bands as seell upon the glaciers of Grindelwald and the Rhone is attempted On the former glacier the bands were particularly well developed  Since the presentation of the paper I have tried to reproduce the veined structure on a small scale by comppressing snow In some cases the section of the mass perpendicular to the surfaces on which the pressure was exerted ex hibited in a feeble but distinct manner an appearance the same in kind as that of the veined structure of the glacier ice stripes more transparent than the sur rounding ice were observed at right angles to thc direction of pressure I have also succeeded in impressing upon a perfectly transparent prism of ice a cleavage which certainly surpassed my expectations The cleavage as in the case of the glacier and of slate rock is perpendicular to the direction of pressure On placing a specimen of the squeezed mass before a highly comnpetent judge he at first imagined it to be a piece of gypsumn The full details of these experiments shall be communicated in duie time to the Royal Society The case then as regards slaty cleavage and the structure of glacier ice stands thus The testimony of independent observers proves that they are both laminated at right angles to the direction of pressure and the question occurs Is the pressure sufficient to produce the cleavage  Experiment replies in the affiriDative I have reduced slate rock to an almost impalpable powder and reproduced from it the laminatioln by pressure In the glacier we 1ind equally the cleaved structure associated with pressure and the above experimenits prove the sufficiency of the pressure to produce the structure By combining the conditions of nature we have produced her results alnd it may perhaps be questioned whether a theory is capable of more convinicing proof than that thus furnishedJ T337 and a portion of the glacier where they did not exist was presented to us simultaneously with the bands upon another portion Their proximate origin and final completion were thus before us The explanation offered in the paper is that the dirt scattered by ava lanches and winds over the upper regions of a glacier is redistri buted by the passage of the glacier down a cascade where the ice is shattered and the dirt broken up into detached patches On reach ing the bottom where the force becomes one of compression the patches of dirt are squeezed longitudinally and drawn out laterally being thus converted into stripes of discoloration which owing to the speedier motion of the centre of the glacier are convex towards its lower extremity On consulting the map of Prof Forbes it will be seen that the dirtbands commence at the base of the icefall of the Talefre while none exist above the fall Those shown on the Glacier du Geant we are led to infer commence at the base of the Cascade of la Noire which however is not sketched oni the map The theory of Prof Forbes is that a glacier throughout its entire length is composed of alternate segments of hard and porous ice that the dirt is washed from the former but finds I a lodgement  in the latter thus giving rise to the phenomenon of the bands We are unacquainted with the experiments on which this theory is founded and have only to state that the bands which we have ob served seem accounted for by the simple explanation given above In the paper experiments are described illustrative of this view and in which the bands are accurately exhibited on a small scale In the course of the inquiry much assistance was derived from the use of troughs of various shapes and sizes through which mud formed by the mixture of finelysifted pipeclay and water was per mitted to flow Coloured circles being stamped upon the mud from the distortion of these the character of the forces whether compressioln or tensioln acting upon the mass was inferred It is needless to say that this mode of experiment does not pledge the authors to the view that ice is similarly constituted to mud Where the mud stretches the ice 6reaks and the experiments were mainly instituted for the purpose of examining the relationi of the forces act ing upon a glacier to its directions of fracture It may however be urged that after all the foregoing experiments do not prove the viscous theory to be wrong The mere fact of338 beilding a prism of ice by fracture and regelation does not prove that ice is nonviscous This is perfectly true nor is it conceived that the onus rests onl us to prove the iiegative here All that is claimed for the foregoing experiments is the referring of certain ob served phenomenia to a true cause instead of to anl imaginary one An illustration may perhaps serve to place this question in its true light By Newtons calculation the velocity of sound through air was oniesixth less than what observation made it and to account for this discrepancy he supposed that the sound passed instan taneouslv through the particles of air time being required only to accomplish the passage from particle to particle Ele supposed the diameter of each airparticle to be I 7ths of the distance between two particles and nobody ever pr oved hims wrong Still when Laplace assigned a vera causa for the discrepancy the hypothesis of Newtoni and other ingeiiious suppositions were discarded The proof indeed in such cases consists in the substitution of a fact for a conjecture and whether this has been dolne in the case nlow before us the intelligent reader must himself decide

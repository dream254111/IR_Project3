RIGHTS AS APPLICABLE TO THE UNITED STATES THE STATE XWAHEN we talk of the State its rights or its structures we are necessarily led to the inquiry What do we mean by the State  Beginning with the proposition that the State is a composite formed of individuals whose lives are shaped by the life of the whole it necessarily follows that a perfect understanding of any particular State would involve a knowledge of the characteristics of the mem bers who compose it This of course is obviously impossible but the theory underlying States generally is founded upon general human characteristics So we may take as a basis the great truth discovered by Aristotle that man is by nature a social and political animal and therefore a member of some State however crude Clearly then it is apparent that the State is not to be considered as in any sense artificial or as a mechanism    The feelings that unite men into social and political units are as natural to them as are any of their individualistic impulses Having given the State then our inquiry into its meaning is concerned with its structure and growth as a social organism I INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATEBroadly defined the State is an independent organized Society2 Here let us consider the import of independence and organization of Society We shall consider them in the inverse order first what is an organ ized Society In view of the fact that Society is an organism including all the ties which in one way and another bind its members together it may be said itself to be organized and though Society necessarily incor porates the political element of its members it is not until this political element manifests itself that Society can in any real sense be said to be organized though after it has all the bonds which go to make up the social body become as much a part of the then organized Society as the actual political ties which together consti tute the people a body politic And the political element as Aristotle has told us is a creation of Nature in man So at this point we find ourselves talking of the body politic itself as a purely natural creationmore or less perceptibly organized as the evolutionary The Nature of the State W W Willoughby p I3I 2 The State and the Individual Wm S McKechnie Ch I p 4420 MICHIGAN LAW REVIIEWV forces of nature have developed its resources and civilized its people Here then when the political element in mans nature begins to exert itself when we see Society taking on shape and formorgan ization if you pleasehowever crude we see the first evidences of the State Sir William Anson states practically the same theory when in speaking of the State he says We need not trouble our selves with the shifting groups of men who form the lowest types of savage life it is early enough to begin with the aggregates bound together by ties of real or supposed kinship and by common customs And when these customs begin to be observed in deference to some other authority than the individual violence or general illwill that arises from their breach we are able to trace the first germs of the State Whether it is a council of priests or of elders or an indi vidual habitually exalted above the rest by his strength or his cun ning so soon as conduct is enforced by some sanction the fear of some evil or hope of some good however indeterminate or occa sional which is not the arbitrary will of the casual bystander or the general inclination of the crowd we see the humble beginnings of the State or Sovereign3 Here is an admirable statement of the transition from a mere Society into a State When Anson says it is enough to begin with the aggregates bound together by ties of real or supposed kinship and by common customs of what is he speaking but Society as nearly as it can be described apart from its government A slight reference to government creeps in and inevitably so by his speaking of men being bound together by common customs then again when he says and when these customs begin to be observed is he not giving us an organized Society presupposing the work of the individual as a political animal  I GOVERNMENTAnd what is this organization in Society after all this outward manifestation of mans political nature but govern ment more or less recognizable as such as it is itself more or less complete and perfect While the centralizing force of a people lies essentially in mans individual nature it is not until we have gotten away from the idea of its being an individual possession and regard it as pervading the whole social organism that we can have any conception of government as a development of Nature Mr Kelley observes that government is in one sense no invention of man for it is impossible to observe the habits of any animals or insects which live in communities without concluding that they are governed by an unwritten code which increases in differentiation 3 The Law and Custom of the Constitution Sir yWm Anson Vol T p 4TREATIMAKING POWfER VS STATE RIGHTS according as the community itself is advanced in structure So if we examine the habits of a nest of ants we shall conclude that they have a scheme of government more differentiated and better enforced than that of most of our savage races The next fact that it seems pertinent to notice is that the code of unwritten rule which prevails in animal conmunities resembles that which prevails amongst savage races in the force which keeps this code alive it is not the force of a king or of courts of justice or of police it is force of habit4 This mierely challenges attention to the fact that government is not neces sarily the work of deliberation and intellectual effort but may result from habit or blind growth except of course in so far as man being himself a rational being is necessarily conscious to a greater or less extent of what he does Mr Kelley goes on to say that It is at the moment when this blind unreflecting force of habit yields to deliberative purposive conduct that savagery ends and civilization begins for it is then that man parts company with the lower animals and ceases to be unconsciously subservient to the natural instincts to which up to that time he had been blindly subject    Human government is purposive not merely instinctive It is the result of intellectual effort engaged in making its own environ ment and no longer the unconscious result of the environment fur nished by Nature5 It might be well here to ask Mr Kelley the question Mr McKechnie asks in criticising Mr Mill is it not possible that this human voluntary agency this intellectual effort is itself included in the whole which grows Now coming back to Anson it is worth while to note that what IMr Kelley would call involuntary deliberative government or in other words government by habit he calls government by custom habit and custom being synonymous And when these customs he saysor habits if you willbegin to be observed in deference to some other authority than the individual violence or general illwill that arises from their breach we are able to trace the first germs of the State In other words when conduct is enforced by some sanction that conduct becomes law and that sanction when other than the individual violence or general illwill is sovereign Here then there is government an expression of organized Society with out which no State could exist6 How evident it becomes then that government is essentially a development of nature though it may nay must be to a greater or less extent formed influenced and developed through conscious deliberate human effort which of course itself advances by mere force of evolution 4 Government or Human Evolution Kelley Bk III Ch I  Government or Human Evolution p 213 The State and the Individual McKechnie Ch VII p io8 2 I2MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW We are still considering Society with regard to its organization and having arrived at government as a development of the social organism attention is called to the fact that the theory of its so being is founded upon the existence of two things in Societyfirst law and secondly a sovereign A LAWThis law as we have seen need not necessarily be intelligible On the other hand it may be of ever so low a type the habits of animals or customs of men obedience to it may be blind undeliberative and unconscious responsive merely as a mat ter of Nature but it is none the less law so far as being the basis of government is concerned Were it not that we are attempting to show the evolution of the State from Nature beginning with man at a stage little better than that of savagery and tracing his social relations through the various stages of his growth it would be entirely superfluous to discuss the law of habit or custom such as we find existing among animals as forming the basis of the law upon which human institutions and governments are built By so doing however we easily get away from any superstition that government is something peculiarly human a creation of the will permeated by contract It necessarily brings us to the conclusion that were man not a rational being and not therefore a man he would still be a subject of government more or less like that of the lower animals Government then in the most general sense is not dependent on rationalism but when forming a part of the social relations of mian it does depend upon rationalism to the extent that the rational element pervades the animal personalityto this extent and no further can the conscious efforts of men shape and mould the government under which they live a The ColstituztionThis law which is at the basis of gov ernment is not necessarily then of human creation but may be the law of the ant hill the beehive or the jungle which for a better name we call instinct or more correctly since we do not know what it is the law of Nature But all law as we well know is not the law that orders battle among ants or declares slavery in the hive When applied to the conduct of human affairs that law incorporates the human element and in that of course it is different from the law of instinct The rational deliberative element enters into it which naturally gives rise to complications that are not found in the life of animals and the greater the rational element the higher thecivilization the more complex is the system under which a people live The more highly developed forms of animal organisml says Mr McKechnie require a proper system of 22TREATYMAKING POWER VS STATE RIGHTS 23 organs a series of nerves and muscles and a skeleton It is the same with highly developed states They require a skeleton to keep the various members together7 And this skeleton is called a Con stitution nothing new or introduced here for the first time to facilitate the argument but a stage merely in the development of law in the social organism There may be an attempt at penning it as in our own country or it may be allowed to find its only expression in habit and custom as in England It is comparatively easy then to see that introducing the idea of a Constitution at this point is no innovation but an inevitable consequence of law being a part of mans evolution Its development is out of the more inferior organization and concentration of law which precedes it and of which it never ceases to be a part It is this factor that makes a complete written Constitution impossible A peoples Con stitution in the broadest sense cannot be comprehended within the construction of sentences and interpretation of words It is infinitely too great to find an expression in language however general or specific the terms used may be The very problem that confronts any attempt to do so is how far can the demand for generality on the one hand be encroached upon by the specification and detail necessary on the other to give the instrument practical value as far as possible in securing the end desired without confining it to limits which have already been outgrown b Interpretation of Written ConstitutionsOnce given the finished product a written Constitution it would seem that there was no chance for dispute or misunderstanding as to just what the law is but how well we know such is not the case Our own con stitutional history affords a splendid illustrationthe highest con summation of intellectual effort to embody in one instrument a peoples law and at the same time the most divergent views regard ing its interpretation and construction It is the inevitable conse quence of human inability to supply an all sufficient code of laws general enough to meet all contingencies and specific enough to be capable of definite application So a written Constitution with its advantages brings with it the question eternal what does this meana call for constant interpretation And of what significance is this None perhaps except as to the manner in which this inter pretation is made the subtle working up of that great body of unwritten law8 that undercurrent of public opinion fostered by 7 The State and the Individual McKechnie Ch V p Ioo 8In Mormon Church v U S I36 U S I Mr Justice BRADLEY held that limitations are in many instances not found in the Constitution but upon the fundamental principles upon which our government is foundedMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW custom and consciousness into the very life and spirit of language that was never intended to contain it A Constitution incapable of growing itself will grow anyway by interpretation Meanings are essentially put into it in order to draw from it the proper imple nments with which to meet the infinite variety of contingencies that arise in a peoples history But this is not disparaging written Con stitutions In fact it is this interpreting the set language in the light of commono justice and reason that makes written Constitu tions possible and it is only when it is not done and the strict letter of the law is enforced against the reason and spirit of it that trouble arises The extent to which this was the occasion for the rise of the two schools of thought respecting our own Constitution will be discussed further on A complete Constitution if such a thing were possible would provide for everything all the various relations international and ldomestic that arise in the life of a people living under it It would be like a point in which all the laws are brought to a focus the concentrated essence of the legal system of a nation But such a Constitution exists only in theory In practice this small world of law is dependent on the great forces of life that rage around it From these it draws its vitality and it may be invaded or over thrown by violence from without The lawordered universe rests on rude forces which it cannot always chain At any moment these may break through the forms of the law and violently alter the structure of the Constitution Any such forcible invasion of the sphere of law constitutes a revolution9 VWe shall have occasion later on to note a series of such revolutions the result of which has been to change the United States from a mere band of States into a banded State The question naturally arises here What relation exists between the Constitution of a State and its government Is it as Anson says the working machinery of the State10 It is more correctly perhaps a series of rules defining what that machinery shall be The government does the workit is the active agent while the Constitution lays down the rules for its regulation   The one represents the theorythe other practice B THE SOVEREIGN AND SOVEREIGNTYReverting now to our previous consideration that governmlent is founded upon the exist ence of law and a Sovereign and having traced the development 9 The State and the Individual McKechnie p o02 0 Law and Custom of the Constitution Anson Vol I p 2 l The State and the Individual McKechnie p 104 The Nature of the State W W Willoughby p 130 24TREATYMAKING POWER VS STATE RIGHTS of law from habit and custom into a positive and definite factor the Constitution it remains to direct our inquiry to this Sovereign How does a Sovereign arise There is nothing peculiar in the mere fact that an absolute unlim ited dominating force should exist in the conduct of huiian affairs more than in anything else in the universethat is the order of things evidenced in all forms of life But the character of this force and the manner in which it acts upon its subjects is shaped largely if not entirely by the life of a people living under it Barbarism tends to promote the development of a few mighty personalities around whom the people gather as the best existing nucleus of their power They set up their king give him strength to overcome rebellion and to fix the political status of the individual in the com munity They establish the objective unity of the State They bring the absolute sovereignty to objective realization2 The king is the State and not until educating influences awaken the people to an understanding of themselves and a realization of their power is there any attempt to discriminate them But refinement in ideas of government quicken into realities the absolute monarch of yesterday is but the first servant of his people today Men have developed a common consciousness a will that the despot must combat singlehanded they cease to fear out of mere superstition and to reverence for pure traditions sake The strongholds of tyranny are swept away and if open rebellion is not incensed by monarchical abuse and oppression it will eventually come through the peoples distrust in another doing for them what they are capable of doing for themselves They seize upon the royal power divest it of its sovereignty and retain only the office and the name if they can be adjusted to the situation otherwise they are dispensed with entirely The State is no longer the king but the people in sov ereign organization 1 hence the distinction between the State and its government In one sense the State may be regarded outside of and supreme over the government but when we assign to it this separate and supreme position we are in greater or less degree confounding the subjective with the objective state the ideal with the actual state14 The State is perhaps properly regarded outside of and supreme over any particular form of government for a State without reference to any particular State could exist without a monarchy or without an aristocracy or without a democracy but not without any one of 12 Political Science

REVIEW theln if we regard this classification as encompassing the entire field of government15 Government is a part of the State rather than a part from it for no State could exist without a government So when we talk of the State in the broadest and most general sense we should have care to speak of its government its sovereign and its sovereignty in the same general sense and thus avoid confounding the various meanings of which the words are susceptible Sovereignty however general the sense in which we regard it must find an embodiment in some determinate person or institution available for the ordinary purposes of government16 In every political society says Anson there must be some person or body which acts on behalf of the whole which represents the State as dealing with other States which represents its collective force and will in maintaining among its own citizens the rules which the Society has made or accepted for the preservation of order and pro motion of the public welfare7 but this person or body may be the Sovereign or it may be merely an agent of the Sovereign The Sov ereign may for one reason or another be unable to act on behalf of the whole or represent the whole in dealings with other States We might suppose such a case where an absolute monarch goes insane or is incapacitated for any other reason and the administrative function is performed by his ministers or someone else in his behalf Such a situation prevails in this country where the Sov ereign from its very nature is unable to perform administrative functions but the people are none the less sovereign because these functions are exercised by an institution on behalf and in the name of the people Mr McKechnie has nominated this determinate per son or institution the legal sovereign to distinguish it from the peo ple whom he calls the political or real sovereign While this is a convenient distinction to make for purposes of discussion it is hardly justifiable in theory and is likely to lead one to conclude that Sov ereignty itself is divisible and that therefore within the same State there may be more than one Sovereignty which is impossible Sovereignty says Mr Curtis is the will of the sovereign peo ple and government which is a mere servant or trustee can never 5 Aristotles Classification 16 The State and the Individual McKechnie p 13I 7 Law and Custom of the Constitution Anson Vol II Ch I p I 18 Sovereignty as thus expressing the States supreme will is necessarily a unity and indivisible That there cannot be in the same being two wills each supreme is obvious But though the supreme will of the State may not be divided it may find expression through several legislative mouthpieces and the execution of its commands may be del egated to a variety of governmental organsThe Amer Constl System Willoughby P 5 26TREATYMIAKING POWER VS STATE RIGHTS be sovereign for it wields delegated powers only The people might have a hundred governments each a specified power without sur rendering one atom of sovereignty Sovereignty being the will of the people is spiritual and indivisible It may grant powers for the common good but the invocation of those powers is of the essence of free will Accordingly all that talk of the JacksonWebster Madison school of sovereignty part delegated to the Federal gov ernment and part to the State government is the merest claptrap ever devised The error lies in confusing powers which are capable of division with sovereignty which is not Sovereignty means sim ply a right to govern Undoubtedly sovereignty is the will of the sovereign people and in our American sense all government is derived from that will But when it is said that government can never be sovereign there is a begging of the question for it may be the will of the people that a particular government shall exercise the power of governing19 This particular phase of our argument was prefaced by the state ment that government was founded upon the existence of twc things law and a Sovereign and we found in developing the idea of law on the one hand that we intercepted the domain of govern ment in discussing the Constitution and now we encroach upon it again by going into the theory of the Sovereign and Sovereignty all of which goes to prove that they have no separate existence but are so much a part of each other that it is quite impossible to define one without introducing an element of the other an ever present condition in the life of any organism Mr Wheaton divides Sovereignty into two classes internal and external It is the former we have been considering that which is inherent in the people of any State or vested in its ruler by its municipal constitution or fundamental laws This is the object of what has been called internal public law droit public interne but which may more properly be termed constitutional law20 This completes our discussion of the organization of Society It remains to consider it from the standpoint of its independence II EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATEGoing back to our defirlition of the State it will be remembered that it was defined as an independent organized Society Proceeding upon the theory of its organization we have examined its interior structure and growth Our next consideration shall be of the independent or external aspect of Society No Society however complete its organization is capable of abso 19 Curtis Constl Hist of the U S Vol II p 520 20 Elements of International Law lienry Wheaton 3rd Ed Sec 20 p 32 27MICHIGAN LAWV REVIEW lute independence Every nation finds its conduct regulated to a certain extent by a more or less defined system of law Nature never intended that any one race society or community should be entirely selfsubsisting any more than an individual In the life of States there is in some degree the same reaching out for what others produce and furnish that is found in the life of the individual And it is not strange either the State is a moral person It delib erates takes resolutions in common has an understanding and a will peculiar to itself and is therefore susceptible of obligations and laws2 In truth it is an old theory that that State is the most perfect which most nearly interprets the individual in all that it does Measuring a State by this standard then we are driven to conclude that the better a State is the more its obligations resemble those of individuals Vattel goes too far in emphasizing the inde pendence of the States or Nation over that of the individual Tech nically it is not true that citizens of a State cannot enjoy full and absolute independence because they have surrendered a part of their privileges to the Sovereign but that the State remains abso lutely free and independent with respect to all men or to foreign nations when it does not voluntarily submit to them2 Unques tionably there is much more latitude in the independence of States than in that of individuals but this is due it would seem to the impnerfect individualism of the State rather than to the nature of the State itself Individualization is to States what civilization is to man States have always possessed an interior organization more or less individualistic in its nature but in relation to other States the condition is still one of barbarity The State is yet to realize that condition under which it may treat with other States much the same as one man does with another under a more certain and defined code of law We are however more apt to conclude that the present day condition in this regard is barbaric when we view it in the light of the possibilities of the future than when we open a text on international law where it would seem that all possible contingencies were provided for The law of the day however primitive though it may be is what we are concerned with in this paper I SOVERErGNTYA State that is sovereign within itself and it is not within the full import of the word a State unless it is sov ereign 28 is in a sense sovereign for all purposes internationally as well as constitutionally Theoretically there is no difference in 21 The Law of Nations M De Vattel Sec 2

sovereign in respect to itself but practically the situation is one of considerable difficulty States have been classified by Mr Lawrence as Sovereign States and part Sovereign States24 A word now as to the expediency of this classification Sovereignty we have said is the supreme abso lute uncontrollable power by which any State is governed25 which obviously precludes the existence of more than one Sovereign in or over a single State and a State on the other hand is said to include in an international sense the whole of an organized and independent society its territory and every individual under its jurisdiction26 How then from the standpoint of the law of nations or international law can there be such a thing as a part Sovereign State except of course in the sense that no State is abso lutely independent and may be limited more or less by its own con stitution or by stipulations of unequal treaties27 The situation is all the more complicated when we come to consider the constitu tional aspect of the State It is as Mr McKechnie says Inter national law is not entangled in the dispute of party politics and thus arises more easily above the influences of prejudice In Con stitutional Law on the other hand there is unfortunately much danger of definitions being contorted by zealous partisans on one side or the other to support some special theory of internal politics28 This is precisely the condition we encounter in talking of a Sover eign or part Sovereign State Usage has made both the word Sovereign and State susceptible of various meanings so we are left to inquire into the nature of the thing described in order to ascertain the sense in which the phrase Sovereign State is used The word State is used to mean not only the entire community or independent political Society but is sometimes limited to mean merely the sovereign body in that Society29 Again a State once having been Sovereign may continue to be called a State when 24 Principles of International Law T J Lawrence Sec 42 p 55 25 Cooleys Constl Lim 26 The State and the Individual McKechnie p 52 27 The mere fact of dependence however does not prevent a State from being regarded in international law as a separate and distinct sovereignty capable of enjoying the rights and incurring the obligations incident to that condition Much more importance is attached to the nature and character of its connection with other States and the nature and extent of its dependence Thus many European States which are still regarded as sovereign do not exercise the right of selfgovernment entirely independent of other States but have their sovereignty limited and qualified in various degrees either by the character of the internal constitution or by stipulations of unequal treaties of alliance and protectionInt Law H W Halleck p i65 28 The State and the Individual McKechnie p 53 29 The State and the Individual McKechnie p 48 29MICHIGAN LAW REVtIEWI shorn of its Sovereignty10 and under Mr Butlers theory that the Sovereignty of the United States passed directly from Great Britain to the people and that the States were never severally sovereign31 we find the word State applied to political divisions which never possessed Sovereignty at all And as to Sovereignty Mr Mc Kechnie observes that No term used in political science has given rise to more discussion or is indeed of such intrinsic difficulty There are no less than three meanings of the word32 It is used in the sense of our gracious sovereign meaning the individuals in whose name the government is conducted and it may mean the sovereign people to indicate the Sovereign of last resQrt the will of the Sovereign people and again as applicable to the English government the sovereignty of Parliament or the legal sover eign whose prerogative is enforced by law as opposed to that of the sovereign people whose sovereignty is enforced by sanction partly moral and partly physical In this confusion it is obvious that the words State and Sovereign standing alone define noth ing in particular so we must take them in the sense in which they are used Even if we were to arrive at single and definite mean ings of the words it would not necessarily follow that their appli cation would be uniformly correct There is of course the ideal the theoretical conception of the State as there is of Sovereignty but in this sense the words are of no practical value except that we understand them as relatively only to the ideal as a lesser expres sion of it It becomes a matter then of judgment to what extent just how far a body politic must approach the ideal before it can properly be called a State to what degree a State must be inde pendent abroad and absolute at home in order to be rightly called Sovereign In all these questions usage and custom must decide 2 THE LAW oF NATIONSOnce having given a Sovereign State within the ordinary acceptation of the term we shall proceed to inquire into the effects of its independence or Sovereignty the rights it confers and the duties it imposes First of all the State no less than the individual has the right of selfpreservation and security Nature gives every State as well as every man the right to suffer no obstruction to its preservation its happiness and its perfection33 This and many other fundamental rights among which is the right to make treaties is

their necessities require and are capable of doing with out neglecting what they owe to themselves34 The law of nations35 says Vattel is originally no more than the law of nature applied to nations but he goes on to say that owing to the fact that nations are so different in their character from other subjects of the law of nature very different obligations arise and it is the art of applying this law to the different subjects with justice founded on right reason that renders the law of nations a distinct science36 a The TreatyIt is in pursuance of this law and by virtue of sovereignty37 that treaties are made specifically declaring what the law is or how and by what means it shall be carried into effect On first thought it might seem that a treaty or pact of any kind between two or more States would be in derogation of the natural law rather than in conformity to it since the contracting parties deem it necessary to resort to such formality This however is not the case A treaty which does not conform to the natural law of nations is void or at least voidable38 The force of a treaty is that it gives greater reason legally not morally to what States might otherwise do in that it may bind them to a more certain and definite line of conduct than they would have to pursue under the more general law The word for treaty in Latin is tcdus meaning a pact made by the superior power for the general welfare to endure for per petuity or for a considerable time Pacts as to transitory affairs are called agreements conventions or pactions39 There are many phases of the treaty that might be indulged in as having an indirect bearing upon our subject but only those which are most essential are discussed here The essentials of a valid treaty are a Capacity of the parties to

binding effect if in fact such a law has been violated42 The treatymaking power of a State is determined by its own constitution or fundamental law43 which may impose certain restrictions upon the method of entering into such agreements44 Under Article II Section 2 of the Constitu tion which provides that the President shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties pro vided twothirds of the Senators concur it has been urged that a treaty between the United States and a foreign nation being a con tract is conclusive against all departments of government and that foreign nations know only the President and Senate in the contract on the part of the United States45 To place such a construction upon the treatymaking power would mean that through its exercise a State or any part of its territory could be ceded to a foreign power notwithstanding the Constitution guarantees every State a republican form of government 46 commerce might be regulated despite the fact that Congress alone has that power47 duties could be imposed upon articles of importation or they might be admitted free of duty even though that power is expressly vested in Con gress48 revenue could be appropriated from the public treasury and withdrawn without any action on the part of Congress49 Such an interpretation of the power far from being American is not necessary

with draw their assent unless they have done something which would amount to a waiver of the right to withdraw51 The mere fact however that the concurrence of Congress may be necessary to carry a treaty into effect or to turn a proposed treaty into a treaty in fact does not mean that Congress can inquire into the terms of the treaty and so itself become the treatymaking power or any part of it52 The duty of Congress is to enact appro priate legislation to carry the proposed treaty into effect unless the fundamental law of the State would be violated by its so doing The terms of the treaty itself the effect they would have and the prob able consequences of their being enforced are questions entirely for eign to Congress and cannot be legally indulged in by it This is not saying however that these matters may not have a decided moral effect upon the action of Congress The terms and object of a proposed treaty depending upon congressional action to give it effect are very properly moral considerations and so they must be regarded Any broader construction upon the congressional power would virtually make that body a branch of the treatymaking power53 a construction that cannot be fairly deduced from the Constitution The second essential of a valid treaty dulyempowered agents to act on behalf of the States is likewise determined by a States fun damental law As to who

not empowered to so act nor by the acts of a duly empowered agent when he has exceeded his authority If however a State has received material benefits from a contract ing State acting in pursuance of a contract illegally entered into there is a duty upon the State receiving such benefits to make proper compensation and place the injured State in statu quo as far as practicable But no such obligation arises if the acts of the agent were so clearly in excess of his powers that the contracting State should have been aware of the same54 The third essential freedom of consent does not mean that a State may not under any circumstances be bound by a treaty to which it has been obliged to submit Treaties of this character the object of which is the settlement of wars are held valid upon the 51 International Law Glenn p I40 2 International Law Halleck p 192 53 International Law Halleck p I92 4 International Law Glenn p I40AMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW theory that the complete subjugation of one of the parties is better than the utter exhaustion of both Where constraint is employed however upon a States sovereign commander or any agent of the State authorized to negotiate a treaty and while under such con straint the terms of a treaty are extorted from him the freedom of consent within the meaning of international law has been denied and a treaty consummated thereunder is absolutely void55 The fourtli and last essential is the object of the contract must be in conformity to law that is the end sought must be such as is consistent with international law A treaty the object of which is the exercise of proprietary rights over the sea would be void and if it imposes conditions upon a State that are incompatible with its life and growth it would be at least voidable These are the important general considerations regarding the treaty which concern us in this discussion But before they can be intelligently discussed in relation to the United States the fundamen tal law must be consulted for it is that we must remember which determines the right of a State to make treaties or to be bound by them THE TREATY AND THE AMERICAN STATE I WHO Is SOVEREIGNSovereignty or the right to govern is the source of all law56 but only of course in a political sense unless we regard Sovereignty and Nature as the same When we speak of Sovereignty we presuppose the existence of the body pol itic By reason of Sovereignty the body politic acquires rights which give rise to corresponding obligations relative to its conduct with other States and itself The right to make treaties we have seen grows out of a States Sovereignty howbeit it is exercised in pursuance of the law of nations But Sovereignty as the source of constitutional rights we have yet to consider where it resides how and by whom it is exercised and the consequences as bearing upon the making of treaties Professor Willoughby has said and rightly so that there cannot be any such thing as a State composed of States57 meaning that there cannot exist more than one Sovereignty within the same body politic since Sovereignty is supreme and absolute The term Federal State therefore he goes on to say is only correctly employed to designate a State in which a very considerable degree of administrative autonomy is given to the several districts into 6International Law Glenn pp 141 I53 6The Amer Constl System Willoughby p 33 6T The Amer Constl System Willoughby p 9 34TREATYMAKING POWER VS STATE RIGHTS 35 which the States territory is divided and conversely in all com posite political organizations in which the individual members still retain their sovereignty no National State is created and any written articles of union if such there be cannot be regarded as a Constitution but only as an international compact or treaty58 From the very outset of our constitutional history there have been conflicting theories respecting the Federal and the State govern ments two distinct schoolsof thought and between the extremes stood those who endeavored to compromise conflicting opinions59 So it is not surprising that one finds abundant material to support the numerous theories that have been advanced at different times by different writers In all these controversies however the States Rights advocates have held to a single and consistent theory main taining that the Constitution always was and is a compact between the several States acting as individual and sovereign entities In the light of what we have already said this doctrine would turn the Constitution into a mere compact or treaty binding the Sovereign States only by the rules of international law Opposed to this argument are the numerous theories propounded by the advocates of national supremacy The position maintained by some is that admitting that the States were severally sovereign prior to the Constitution the records of the intentions of its framers cooperate with a reasonable interpretation of its language in show ing that the States intended to and in fact did surrender their title to sovereignty60 Another explanation is that the moment the colo nies threw off the sovereignty of Great Britain they became in their then united capacity a sovereign nation and that the States as entities were never sovereign61 Without attempting to discuss the respective merits of these arguments it may be said that in so far as they deny that the revolution transformed the thirteen colonies into thirteen severally sovereign States they are contrary to the vast weight of evidence 68 The American Constl

alle giance was as separate entities is still a matter of dispute as is also the exact time that the colonies threw off the British yoke These troublesome questions will always be open to discussion for the colonies were in an actual state of rebellion long before July 4 177662 But the earliest time claimed for the existence of a national State is the assembling of the First Continental Con gress63 To ascertain the nature of this Congress and the extent of its powers let us inquire into the manner of its creation and the instructions of the delegates who composed it Delegates from two colonies were chosen by the legislatures The Massachusetts dele gates were chosen by the lower house and Georgia was not repre sented In only six colonies were there held special conventions for the choosing of delegates64 These facts it would seem do not comport with Justice Storys idea of this Congress being the peo ple acting directly in their primary sovereign capacity and without the intervention of the functionaries to whom the ordinary powers of government were delegated65 A glance now into the instruc tions of these delegates Four delegations says Professor Van Tyne were instructed to procure the harmony and union of the empire to restore mutual confidence or to establish the union with Great Britain Three were instructed to repair the breach made in American rights to preserve American liberty or to accomplish some similar end Two were to get a repeal of the obnoxious acts or determine on prudent or lawful means of redress Three were simply to attend Congress or to consult to advance the good of the colonies North Carolina alone bound her inhabitants in honor to obey the acts of the Congress to which she was sending delegates When the Congress met it restricted its proceedings absolutely to statements of the grievances and appeals for relief The delegates in no way went beyond their instructions as a careful examination of the journal will show Conservative feelings ruled and the restoration of union and harmony with Great Britain was the preva lent desire It is manifestly wrong therefore to look at the First Continental Congress as coming together because of a national feel ing because of a desire to form a national State and therefore to ascribe to it governmental powers It was called because a joint 62 The TreatyMaking Power Butler

be more effective than any simple petition he colonies sending delegates to the First Continental Congress no more coalesced into a national State by that act than did the colonies which sent delegates to the Albany Congress or the Stamp Act Congress66 And this seems to be the sound view B THE SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESSOf the Second Conti nental Congress which met the year following three of the delega tions were chosen by the legislatures three by the lower houses of the legislatures alone and seven by provincial congresses or conventions Three of these delegations were to merely represent or attend meet and report two were to join consult and advise six were to concert and agree or determine upon while Georgia instructed her dele gates To do transact join and concur with the several delegates Maryland and North Carolina bound the people of the State to abide by the action of Congress at first and similar measures were taken by Georgia and New Jersey later Eight of the colonies for warded new instructions to their delegates before January of the following year 1776 but only two changed the charter of their instructions67 Of this Congress Justice Story says The Congress of I775 accordingly assumed the exercise of some of the highest functions of sovereignty68 and true it did but it is important that while these very functions were being exercised Congress was repeatedly voting for reconciliation assuring the King that they were not rais ing their army for the purpose of separation but wished harmony to be restored And until as late as October I775 reconciliation was the common sentiment69 The colonies in the very taking of arms expressed their loyalty to Great Britain and hope of reconciliation which was not necessarily inconsistent But the idea of loyalty to the British King and a coexistent desire for an American national State are incompatible therefore if Congress was doing seemingly sovereign acts it was merely in the capacity of a party committee leading a rebellious faction in the empire in an attempt to force the concession of its rights70 The time came however when the bonds of loyalty were broken but what transpired at that time could not well be construed as creating a consolidated independent State In fact it was declared in debating the resolution that if the delegates of any particular colony had no power to declare such colony inde 66 Amer Hist Review Vol XII No 3 p 530 67 Amer Hist Review Vol XII No 3 p 531 68 Storys Commentaries Vol I p I57 69 Amer Hist Review Vol XII No 3 p 533 75 Amer Hist Review Vol XII No

upon the Declaration in the State conventions and legislatures shows clearly that their assent was given as separate independent States In Pennsylvania the convention declared that before God and the world that we will support and maintain the freedom and independence of this and the other United States of America and Connecticut assembly resolved that this Colony is and of right ought to be a free and independent State But what the States may have thought they were doing is better shown by what they in fact did than by any language South Carolina expressly gave itsgovernment the power of making war concluding peace entering into treaties lay embar goes and provide an army and navy and Virginia acting under implied power ratified the treaty with France and by law estab lished a clerkship of foreign correspondence72 In the face of these facts it is difficult to see how the Congress can be other than John Adams describes it not a legislative assembly nor a representative assembly but only a diplomatic assembly73 No doubt but that there was a national consciousness the lan guage history manners and laws would tend to give rise to such a feeling but until a national State in fact came into being we cannot properly speak of its Sovereignty C THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATIONThe next event that con cerns us in this connection is the adopting of the Articles a step further toward a national unity though an insufficient one At the same time independence was declared a committee was appointed to draft a written Constitution which was submitted to Congress in the autumn of I777 but was not ratified by all the colonies until 178I The position of the colonies ils here set forth in no equivocal language Article II expressly provides that Each State retains its sovereignty freedom and independence and every power jurisdic tion and right which is not by this Confederation expressly dele gated to the United States in Congress assembled The use of the phrase retains its sovereignty etc is significant in showing a complete recognition of State sovereignty Article III reads the said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other etc which clearly indicates the nature of the rela tion created bv the Articles It must be conceded then that up 71Amer Hist Review Vol XI1 No 3 Note by Wilson Livingstone etc Jour of Congress

until the adoption of the Constitution at least the States were severally sovereign III THE CONSTITUTIONA VIEWS REGARDING ITNow the Constitution brought forward what had been a growing tendency from the very firsta national State capable of exercising sovereign powers But the Constitution was generally regarded at the time of its adoption and for some time after its ratification as a compact between States Madison says This assent and ratification is to be given by the people not as individuals composing one entire nation but as composing the distinct and independent States to which they respectively belong It is to be the assent and ratification of the sev eral States derived from the supreme authority in each Statethe authority of the people themselves The act therefore establishing the Constitution will not be a national but a Federal act74 And this was the accepted opinion of the day The people thought they were establishing a central government which was to act as an agent of the severally sovereign States united in a supposed league or confed eration but a National State under which no right was reserved by the States of either nullification or secession a logical as well as practical impossibility Such however was the situation It seemed plausible that a sovereign State could be created from sovereign States each surrendering certain of its rights much in the same way a State may be formed of individuals each sovereign within the sphere of his own person yet obligated in other respects to a superior power The Virginia convention called to vote upon the proposed Constitution was characterized by heated arguments both for and against its adoption Patrick Henry opposed its rati fication for the new plan he said was indisputably a consolidated government and not a confederacy The preamble We the Peo ple not We the States he said would admit of no other inter pretation If the States were not the parties to this new compact then it must be national in its character And he could not see the need of such a radical change that would so endanger the public peace and safety75 In answer to this objection Madison described the new govern ment as having a dual character In respect to some things it would be Federal and in others consolidated The parties to it were the people not as a mass but as the people of the States severally The assent merely of the majority of the people would be sufficient to establish a purely National State but by the people adopting it as 74 Federalist No 39 75 Curtis Constl Hist of the U S Vol I p 664 39MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW members of the severally sovereign States the act was that of the States76 Here is the objection and the argument by which it was met showing full well that it was thought a legally indissoluble Union could te created by anagreement between sovereign Statesone as Mr Willoughby says in which not simply the exercise of sovereignty but the power itself should be divided between the National State and its member Commonwealths77 The people thought they were creating a State National in its character and at the same time believed the sovereignty of the several Common wealths was not sacrificed Then what of the result B SUBSEQUENT INTERPRETATIONNo sooner had the Consti tution been adopted than it began to receive a liberal interpretation which as we have seen is both consistent and necessary with written Constitutions The establishment of the National Bank in 1791 and granting appellate jurisdiction were the first infringements upon State sovereignty and they were both strenuously objected to as an undue exercise of National power The illogical situation under the Constitution the existence of sovereign States within a State itself sovereign gradually became apparent and although the rights of the States were vigorously defended the general tendency was toward centralization To this was added a decision of the Supreme Court in 1793 Chisholm v Georgia 2 Dall 419 in which the State of Georgia was sued by a citizen of South Carolina the State defending upon the ground that it was a sovereign State and therefore could not be sued without its own consent In his opinion Mr Justice WILsDN said that the citizens of Georgia when they acted upon the large scale of the Union as a part of the People of the United States did not surrender the supreme or sovereign power to that State that is to the State of Georgia but as to the purposes of the Union retained it to themselves As to the purposes of the Union therefore Georgia is not a sovereign State In the same case Mr Chief Justice JAY in delivering his opinion said The Revolution or rather the Declaration of Independence found the people already united for general purposes and at the same time providing for domestic concerns by State conventions and other temporary arrangements From the crown of Great Britain the sovereignty of their country passed to the people of it    afterwards in the hurry of the war and in the warmth of mutual confidence they made a confederation of the States the basis ofa 76 Curtis Constl Hist of the U S Vol I p 667 7T The Amer Constl System Willoughby p 30 40TREATYMAKING POWER VS STATE RIGHTS general government Experience disappointed the expectations they had formed of it and then the people in their collective and national capacity established the present Constitution    Every State Constitution is a compact made by and between the citizens of a State to govern themselves in a certain manner and the Constitution of the United States is likewise a compact made by the people of the United States to govern themselves as to gen eral objects in a certain manner It was ordered that judgment would be taken against the State by default unless it appeared or showed cause to the contrary Georgia declared that she would not be bound by the decision and threatened death to any person who should come within her borders attempting to execute the man date of the court And actual rebellion was prevehted only by an amendment amendments Art XI to the Constitution declaring that the judicial power of the United States should not be construed to extend to any suit commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State Clearly the national government was not the loser when it took an amendment to abridge its power In Ware v Hylton 3 Dall 236 decided in I796 Mr Justice CHASE sets out the strongest opinion favoring the unlimited extent of the treatymaking power upon record But this case will be discussed in a subsequent section of this paper This was followed in 1803 by the case of Marbury v Madison i Cranch 137 in which an act of Congress was for the first time declared unconstitutional The effect of this decision was not alone to establish the authority of the Federal judiciary over the Federal legislature but it indicated with no uncertainty that the power to finally determine the constitutionality of Federal law was in the Supreme Court of the United States and not the States The following year 1804 Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL in The United States v Fisher 2 Cranch 358 said In construing this clause Const Art I Sec 8 Par 9 it would be incorrect and would produce endless difficulties if the opinion should be main tained that no law was authorized which was not indispensably necessary to give effect to a specified power Where various sys tems might be adopted for that purpose it might be said with respect to each that it was not necessary because the end might be obtained by other means Congress must posssess the choice of means and must be empowered to use any means which are in fact conducive to the exercise of a power granted by the Consti tutiona positive assertion that Congress is not bound under the 4IMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW elastic clause in the Constitution to pass only such measures as are indispensable to the exercise of its express power and further that Congress itself has the choice of means it shall employ in carrying such express power into effect In I809 just five years later The United States v Peters 5 Cranch II5 was decided The facts briefly stated were these In 1777 an admiralty court of Pennsylvania condemned and sold as a prize a fishing vessel The State marshal had been forbidden to pay over the proceeds to the State Court upon an appeal to the Com mittee of Appeals of the Continental Congress the money notwith standing was paid over to the State officials and found its way into the States treasury Suit was brought in I803 in the District Court to recover this money from the estate of the treasurer who was then deceased and judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff The Pennsylvania legislature then passed an act denying the author ity of the Federal Court and authorizing the States executive to prevent the execution of the Federal decree by force if necessary Efforts to obtain a settlement were unavailing and finally the United States Supreme Court was asked for a mandamus to com pel the district judge to enforce the judgment In his opinion Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL said If the legislatures of the several States may at will annul the judgment of the courts of the United States and destroy the rights acquired under those judg ments the Constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery and the nation is deprived of the means of enforcing its laws by the instru mentality of its own tribunals and after assigning the reasons he concludes that the State of Pennsylvania can possess no consti tutional right to resist the legal processes which may be directed in this cause    A peremptory mandamus must be awarded The district judge issued a writ of attachment in obedience to this order but in attempting to serve it the marshal found the deceaseds residence surrounded by the State militia which was acting under orders of the Governor in pursuance of the act of the legislature The marshal then summoned a posse comitatus in all about two thousand men As a result of this action the Governor of Pennsylvania appealed to the President of the United States to prevent the execution of the judgment which it was claimed was founded upon a pure usurpation of power but Madison refused to interfere and the money was paid over Afterwards the National Government indicted and secured the conviction of the general of the Pennsylvania militia and the men who had participated in resisting the writ 42TREATYMAKING POWER VS STATE RIGHTS 43 In Fletcher v Peck 6 Cranch 87 decided in I8IO Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL rendering the opinion held a State law impair ing the obligation of a contract to be unconstitutional and void Following this decision in I816 came the case of Martin v Hunters Lessee i Wheat 304 in which the State of Virginia attempted to prevent the decisions of her highest court the Virginia Court of Appeals being reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States when they were adverse to Federal authority In the opinion prepared by Mr Justice STORY it was said The courts of the United States can without question revise the pro ceedings of the executive and legislative authorities of the States and if they are found to be contrary to the Constitution may declare them to be of no legal validity Surely the exercise of the same right over judicial tribunals is not a higher or more dangerous act of sovereign poweranother assertion of National sovereignty The famous case of McCulloch v Maryland 4 Wheat 316 was next decided in I819 While it did not determine any absolutely new constitutional principles the opinion rendered by Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL is a splendid reassertion of the doctrine of implied powers set forth by him fifteen years before in The United States v Fisher supra and that a state may not interfere with the execution of Federal law decided in The United States v Peters supra A portion of the opinion is as follows In discussing this question the counsel for the State of Maryland have deemed it of some importance in the construction of the Constitution to consider that instrument not as emanating from the people but as the act of sovereign and independent States The powers of the generalgov ernment it has been said are delegated by the States who alone are truly sovereign and must be exercised in subordination to the States who alone possess supreme dominion It would be difficult to sustain this proposition The convention which framed the Constitution was indeed elected by the State legislatures But the instrument when it came from their hands was a mere proposal without obligation or pretensions to it It was reported tothe then existing Cougress of the United States with a request that it might be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each State by the people thereof under the recommendation of its legislature for their assent and ratification This mode of pro ceeding was adopted and by the convention by Congress and by the State legislatures the instrument was submitted to the peo ple They acted upon it in the only manner in which they can act safely effectively and wisely on such a subject by assembling inMICHIGAN LAW REVIiEW conventiotn It is true they assembled in their several States and where else could they have assembled No political dreamer was ever wild enough to think of breaking down the lines which sepa rate the States and of compounding the American people into one common mass78 Of consequence when they act they act in their States But the measures they adopt do not on that account cease to be the measures of the people themselves or become the meas ures of the State governments From these conventions the Con stitution derives its whole authority    The assent of the States in their sovereign capacity is implied in calling a convention and thus submitting that instrument to the people But the people were at perfect liberty to accept or reject it and their act was final It required not the affirmance and could not be negatived by the State governments The Constitution when thus adopted was of complete obligation and bound the State sovereignties MARSHALL again asserted the sovereignty of the National Gov ernment in Cohelns v Virginia 6 Wheat 264 decided in 1821 If it could be doubted he said whether from its nature it the National Government were not supreme in all cases where it is empowered to act that doubt would be removed by the declaration that this Constitution and the laws of the United States whicll shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding This is the authoritative language of the American people and if the gentlemen please of the Amer ican States    The people can make the Constitution and the people can unmake it    But this supreme and irresist ible power to make or to unmake resides only in the whole body of the people not in any subdivision of them C SUMMARY AND EFF1CT oI THESE DECISIONSLet us stop here and condense these decisions into a few general propositions that will be available for our discussion of the treaty First as to general matters affecting foreign affairs or territory held in com mon the United States is a Nation and is sovereign Second the National Government is supreme in all cases where it is empowered to act Third Congress is the judge of the means by which its express powers shall be given effect And Fourth the power to determine the constitutionality of Federal law is in the Supreme Court of the United States These would seem in substance to be 78 The Reader Vol IX No 4 The Nation v States Rights Article by A J Bleveridge Mr Beveridges theory undoubtedly represents the tendency of the times 44TREATYAIAKING POWER FS STATE RIGHTS the fundamental results of the first thirty years of Federal adjudica tion The decisions of this period and for several years after were strongly national in character due largely to the dominating influence of Mr Chief Justice JOHN MARSHALL But whatever the cause or the theory back of them may be these decisions stand as a recognized part of our fundamental law All may not agree that they are sound but none can deny that they are law IV NATIONAL SUPREMACYBefore we enter upon a discussion of the relative rights of the Federal Government and the State gov ernments let us avoid a confused idea of what we mean by Gov ernment Primarily of course as we have seen Government is no creation of man but generally it is intended to mean the par ticular form of government including all the various branches of legislative executive and judicial machinery by which a State is managed And it is in this sense that we shall use the word throughout the remainder of this paper In this country the people are the sovereign because sovereignty the right to govern resides in them79 But in every political society there must be some determinate person or institution avail able for the ordinary purposes of governmento8 some person or body which acts on behalf of the whole81 Obviously the people of the United States as the sovereign could not perform the admin istrative functions of government but it is not beyond their power to delegate the exercise of their sovereignty to institutions available for administrative purposes And this they in fact did but by sc doing they parted with none of their sovereignty whatever The exercise of it is all that was delegated and for this reason the right to the exercise of it may be recalled at any time We have already seen that two sovereignties cannot exist within the same body politic and it is equally true that within the same body politic two agents cannot exercise sovereignty on behalf of the sovereign in respect to the same things In case of conflict then between two agents apparently duly empowered by the same sov ereign to exercise sovereignty how are we to determine in a par ticular case which shall prevail This is precisely what we must decide should the general government make a treaty with a foreign State in derogation of an alleged State right But it may be objected that the two agents the National govern ment and the State governments were or are not empowered to act by the same sovereign that the National government received 79 Chisholm Exr v Georgia 2 Dall 472 s0 The State and the Individual McKechnie p I3I 81 Law and Custom of the Const Anson Vol II Ch I p i 45MICHIGAN LAW REVIE its sanction from the whole people and the State governments from the people of the several States Still we maintain that there can be but one supreme absolute uncontrollable power in any State and that in this country that power resides in the people as a whole HIowever sovereign may have been the powers which the States severally exercised prior to the adoption of the Constitution the construction placed upon that instrument by the Supreme Court of the United States is conclusive against any assertion of State sov ereignty It is an expression of the will of the people There is no express language in any of the decisions directly to the effect that the States are not sovereign but what is the inevitable result with a general government supreme in all cases where it is empowered to act with a Congress that is the judge of the manner in which its powers shall be made effective and a Judiciary that alone has the power to determine the constitutionality of the general law Have we not after all a State in which a very considerable degree of administrative autonomy is given to the several districts into which the States territory is divided and not a State composed of States This would seem to be the logical conclusion and one borne out by fact as well The tendency toward centralization has not been one of steady growth It has received many blows and has been the subject of many disputes but has almost invariably emerged the winner82 It is said that during the revolution a man was quicker to remember that he was a New Yorker or Virginian than that he was a citizen of the United Stateshow different today Mr Bryce in speaking of State government says The State set out as an isolated and self sufficing commonwealth It is now merely a part of the grander whole which seems to be slowly absorb ing its functions and stunting its growth as the great tree stunts the shrubs over which its spreading boughs have begun to cast their shade    The truth is that the State has shrivelled up It retains its old legal powers over the citizens its old legal rights as against the central government But it does not interest its citizens as it once did Men do not now say like Ames in 1782 that their State is their country83 True as this condition of affairs is it is not strictly speaking within the province of the constitutional law yer His business is to interpret the law in the light of reason and justice as he finds it in the Constitution and upon the statute books Surrounding influences will get in their work in time 82 Mr Edmund James Pres of the University of Illinois in a speech at the James town exposition September i6 I907 declared that we need a new constitution that our present one is necessarily distorted and violated to meet the exigencies of the day Indianapolis News dated September T6 1907 83 The American Commonwealth abridged ed James Bryce p 386 46TREATYMAKING POWER VS STATE RIGHTS 47 V THE TREATYMAKING POWERA THE FIRST EXERCISE OF THE PowERThe treatymaking power was first exercised by the United States on February 6th 1778 when Benjamin Franklin Silas Dean and Arthur Lee commissioners representing the thirteen United States of America concluded two treaties with France one of amity and commerce84 and the other of alliance85 both of which were ratified by the Continental Congress May 4 I774 Both of these treaties recited the most Christian King and the United States of North America towit setting out the original thirteen States by their names From this wording it is very evident that the States were regarded as and contracted in the sphere of independent sovereignities B UNDER THE ARTICLESUnder the Articles of Confederation treaties were made by commissioners appointed by Congress with Great Britain France Netherlands Sweden and Morocco And these treaties were all contracted in the name of the United States of America showing a recognition on the part of the contracting powers of a National Sovereignty howbeit the domestic situation at the time was as we have seen insufficient to justify it C UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONUnder the Constitution there are just three paragraphs that concern us relative to the treaty Art VI Par 2 which make the Constitution and all laws of the United States passed in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States the supreme law of the land Art II Sec II Par 2 giving the President power with and by the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties provided twothirds of the Senators concur and Art I Sec X Par 2 providing No State shall enter into any treaty alliance or confederation etc Can the exercise of the treaty power as here set forth operate so as to deny a State a right which it derives expressly or impliedly from the Constitution There is no case directly deciding the issue and courts have generally been reluctant in expressing themselves upon it Meeting the proposition squarely it is the opinion of the writer that the question cannot be answered positively one way or the other But let us examine a few frag ments of dicta and opinions of commentators upon the subject in view of formulating a rule that would seem consistent with law and reasonable in its operation The strongest opinion in favor of the unlimited extent of the treatymaking power is that of Mr Justice CHASE in Ware v Hylton 3 Dall 236 decided in 1796 In rendering the opinion 84 U S Treaties and Conventions p 296 85 U S Treaties and Conventions p 3074MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW he says There can be no limitation on the power of the people of the United States    It is the declared will of the people of the United States that every treaty made by the authority of the United States shall be superior to the Constitution and laws of any individual State and their will alone is to decide It has been repeatedly held that any treaty made under the authority of the United States is the supreme law of the land and that the judges in every State are bound thereby anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwith standing Cases in support of this contention are those in which it has been held that State laws which interfere with the rights of aliens to hold and transmit real property are null and void when such rights have been granted by treaty86 But this does not seriousl invade the police power or the reserved rights of the States for a comparatively small amount of property is affected by these cases Besides privileges of this nature are very often the subject of nego tiation and the Federal government would be sorely embarrassed by a lack of power to grant them Judge CooLIY says A State must yield to the supreme law whether expressed in the Constitution of the United States or in any of its laws or treaties87 But in Ware v Hylton 3 Dall I99 and Society v New Haven 8 Wheat 464 it was held that a treaty is supreme only when made in pursuance of that authority which has been conferred upon the treatymaking department and in relation to subjects over which it has jurisdiction In Geoffrey v Riggs I33 U S 258 Mr Justice FIELD did not believe that the treatymaking power of the United States was such as to authorize what the Constitution forbids or a change in the character of the government or in that of one of the States The Supreme Court has Mr Butler tells us Vol II p 56 in regard to treaties as it has in regard to Federal statutes ever kept in view the exclusive right of States to regulate their internal affairs and has not allowed either treaty stipulations or Federal statutes to be so construed as to prevent the proper exercise of police powers People v Gallagher 93 N Y 447 held that the privilege of receiving an education at the expense of the State being created and conferred solely by the laws of the State and always subject to its discretionary regulation might be granted or refused to any individual or class at the pleasure of the State This doctrine is 86 Chirac v Chirac 2 Wheat 259 Canuael v Banks io Wheat I8 Hauenstein v Lynham Ioo U S 483 87 Cooleys Const Limitations

extent of holding that treaties to be valid must be made within the scope of powers vested by the Constitution for there can be no authority of the United States save what is derived mediately or immediately and regularly and legitimately from the Constitution A treaty no more than an ordinary statute can arbitrarily cede away one right of a State to any citizen of a State STORY has said that The language of the Constitution of the United States which gives the character of supreme law to a treaty confines it to treaties made under the authority of the United States That authority is limited and defined by the Con stitution itself The United States has no unlimited but only dele gated authority The power to make treaties is bound by the same limits which are prescribed for the authority delegated to the United States by the Constitution To suppose that a power to make treaties with foreign nations is unlimited by the restraints imposed on the power delegated to the United States would be to assume that by such treaty the Constitution itself might be abrogated and the liberty of the people secured thereby destroyed The power to contract must be commensurate with and not transcend the powers by virtue of which the United States and their government exist and act It cannot contract with a foreign nation to do what is unauthorized or forbiddei by the Constitution to be done The power to contract is limited by the power to do88 And STORY it will be remembered was strongly national in his feelings VI CONCLUSIONThe courts generally are loath to embarrass the Federal government in its exercise of the treatymaking power and the government has been careful to keep within its recognized powers The Department of State in I899 refused an offer on the part of the British government to negotiate a treaty to prevent dis criminatory legislation by the States subjecting foreign insurance companies to higher taxes than domestic companies on the theory that the people of the United States objected to having their self government interfered with9 Thus we see there are limits which whether recognized as a mere matter of expedience or as law absolutely binding have been observed Now are the limits suggested herein fixed pillars in our law 88 3 Story Com on Const  1501 89 Amer Pol Sci Rev Vol I No 3 The Japanese School Question Ames S Hershey50 MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW that must stand on down through the centuries as immovable monu ments to the rights of States determining their status and fixing upon the Federal government forever an obligation to act in accordance therewith Obviously not Such a conclusion would be as extreme as that the power of making treaties is absolutely unlim ited in the extent of its application We are a Nation living under the same flag protected by the same law the benefits of which we cannot partake without being subject to whatever inconvenience or sacrifice it may occasion To the world at large we put up a single front the United States of Americaa Nationnot fortyseven nor thirteen independent Sovereignties Under our existence as a Nation we partake of international relations that would be beyond us as disintegrated States we enjoy a National prestige equal to that of any other power on earth our interests are secure against foreign invasion and because we are a Nation among Nations a Sovereign Nation as much as any other power Our interests are becoming more complex and our obligations to other peoples greater as we indulge in their society and enjoy intercouirse with them A prediction of the future in the light of the present tendency would be indicative of a continually increasing intimacy greater rights and more binding obligations But without regard to the future is it reasonable to suppose that the people of any particular State who are as much a part of the Nation as any other aggregate of individ uals living within its borders and amenable to its laws have the right to deny the obligations that may descend upon them through privileges which they enjoy Admitting that it would be reasonable should the interests of the whole people be jeopardized by the hold ing out of a few These and many other questions that might be asked could be answered as mere moral considerations Upon the theory also that our socalled Federal State is used merely to designate a single Statethe Nationin which the several States are but administrative units for the whole it is clear also that a State could have no real rights capable of being enforced as against the authority of the Nation and theoretically this is precisely the sit uation though in practice it has been so modified as to give rise to a question of its truth in theory Fortunately there is enough agita tion of the States Rights doctrines to keep us from getting lost in a mad Nationality So intense are the centralizing forces that it is not unfair to presume that with no retarding element in our National life we would soon reach our goal and inevitably begin to decline The assertion of the two schools induces conservatism and constraintthe greatest element in the longevity of the State as well as the individualTREATYMAKING POWER VS STATE RIGHTS 51 So we cannot disregard the forces in our life that are so vital to the concern of all those that retard radicalism and conduce deliberation and reason in the administration of our affairs It would seem that with any regard whatever for these consid erations it cannot be said that the power to make treaties is unlim ied No unlimited power exists The only question is where are its limits For an answer we must first look to the Constitution and this we must next interpret in the light of International law for it would be as much folly for a people to deny obligations which the law of Nations imposes upon them because their own Constitution says they were not bound thereby as to claim a right over other Nations because their Constitution says they have such a right We have said that a States right to make treaties is determined by its fundamental law and generally this is true except under some circumstances when the treaty is made in settlement of war but disputes as to what the fundamental law of a State may be are by no means improbablea contingency against which we should provide in construing the power to make treaties In Whitney v Robertsorn 124 U S I90 Mr Justice FILD said By the Constitution a treaty is so placed on the same footing and made of like obligation with an act of legislation Both are declared by that instrument to be the supreme law of the land and no superior efficacy is given to either over the other This it would seem is the true rule so far as the Constitution is concerned but it does not provide for a contingency such as we are supposing in this discussion Before attempting to lay down any general rule let us see whether or not it could be enforced granting that there be one In Foster v Neilson 2 Pet 314 it was held that when tlfe terms of a stipulation import a contract a treaty addresses itself to the political and not the judicial department and Congress must execute it before it becomes a rule of court Where then Congres sional action is not essential to the operation of the treaty it is not a subject over which the Supreme Court can entertain jurisdiction In Fellows v Blacksmith I9 How 366 the rule was laid down that after a treaty has been executed and ratified courts cannot go behind it for the purpose of annulling its operation These however are not assertions that a State is not judicially entitled to relief when its recognized Constitutional rights are with out reason flagrantly impaired and violated by the operation of a treaty And it appears to the writer that there is no valid reason why a State upon proper application to the Supreme Court of the United States is not entitled to a hearing upon an alleged violation of its Constitutional rights irrespective of whether the invasion is52 MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW due to the operation of a treaty or any other cause90 Granting the jurisdiction the remedy and means of securing its enforcement would follow My conclusion is that the question is one that calls merely for the application of equitable principles the nature of the right alleged to have been invaded the extent to which it is abridged the good faith and prudence upon the part of the Federal government are all proper matters to come before the Supreme Court of the United States in determining whether or not the treatymaking power has in fact been misused exercised in a manner and for a purpose that is both unusual and oppressive eminently dangerous to the existence and the welfare of the Nation CHARLES SUMNER CLANCY INDIANAPOLIS 90 Constitution Art III Sec 2

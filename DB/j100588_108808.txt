the Earth By CHARLES CHAMBERS Communicated by General SABINE PBS Iteceived April 30Read May 21 1863 1 IN attempting to frame a theory which shall account for the relations which have been shown to exist between the variations of terrestrial magnetism and the position of the sun with respect to the place of observation on the earths surface the following question presents itself for consideration at an early stage of the inquiry  Are the mag netic effects produced on the earth such as could be explained by the simple supposition that the sun is a great magnet or not The solution of this question will to a certain extent limit the range of probable sources from which to seek the true cause of mag netic variations and is therefore worthy of attention 2 In the first place let us endeavour to find the law of the diurnal variations of the Declination Horizontal Force and Vertical Force at a given place on the earths surface on the supposition that these variations arise from the varying relations as to position of the sun acting as a magnet upon the earth 3 The sun would affect the magnets used for showing the earths changes of force in two waysfirst directly and secondly by inducing magnetism in the soft iron and other inductive matter forming part of the body of the earth this induced magnetism reacting upon the observed magnets 4 Now this subject has been discussed mathematically by POISSON in the case of masses of soft iron having any possible arrangement and he has given expressions for the combined effect of the direct and induced forces upon the magnets making only this restriction which is allowable in the case under consideration that the length of the magnets must be infinitesimally small in comparison with their distance from the nearest particle of iron The expressions are as follows Xl1aXY cZ   a YdX  eYfZ  b Z gX hY1kZ      c where assuming the direction and intensity of the magnetic force exerted directly by the sun upon the centre of the earth to be approximate values of the same elements throughout the body of the earth X represents the resolved part of that force along the perpendicular to the earths axis from the place of observation being reckoned positive when the resolved force acting alone would make the north end of a magnet at the station point towards the earths axis Y is the resolved part of the same force perpen dicular to the meridian plane the positive direction being to eastward Z represents 3 24MR C CHAMBERS ON THE NATURE OF THE the part of the force resolved along the earths axis plus to northward and a b c d e f y h and k are constants which depend on the amount and arrangement of the soft iron of the earth X Y and Z are the combined effects of the direct force of the sun and of the reaction of the magnetism which it induces in the earth upon the magnets at the place of observation in the directions of X Y and Z respectively POISSONS equations  may be derived from the following considerations The inducing force X produces a certain magnetic state in the mass of iron and the magnetism thus induced including that which is caused by the inducing action of the particles of iron upon each other will exert an attraction at the place of observation in the direction of each of the coordinate axes which attraction is assumed to be proportional to the inducing force X the forces due to X in the directions of X Y and Z respectively will therefore be aX dX and gX and those due to Y bY eY hY those due to Z cZ fZ kZ Now adding the forces in the same directions and including the forces X Y and Z which act directly upon the magnets at the place of observation we get X 1 aX  bYcZ Y  dX FeYfZ Z gXhYIkZ 5 In order that POISSONS formulhe should be strictly applicable to the case under consideration we must assume that the whole effect of an inducing force acting upon the earth requires only a few minutes to be acquired and that it is lost with equal facility on the removal of the inducing force It is not necessary that the effects of gain and loss should be momentary 6 We must now transform the coordinates of POISSONS equations to those directions in which the variations of the earths magnetism are always observed viz towards the magnetic east x towards the magnetic north y and vertically downwards z the forces being reckoned positive when acting alone they would make the north end of a magnet point in the directions named and we get a new set of equations AX1BY CZ  d yDXEY FZ   e zGXHYKZ   in which A B C  K are constant numbers being functions of a b c k and of the magnetic declination and latitude of the place of observation 7 Let us observe that during the time in which the earth is making a single revolu tion upon its axis the variations in direction and amount of Z and of R the resultant of X and Y may be disregarded while the direction and value of X and Y vary with the hourangle h of the sun and may be expressed as follows XR cos h0  Y Rsinha    where tan a     i and IR2XYO    This mode of obtaining PoissoNs formulae was suggested by Mr ARCHIBALD SMITH FRS    g   h  k 504SUNS MAGNETIC ACTION UPON THE EARTH X and Y0 being the values of X and Y

Y given by g and h the equations d e and f become XREAcosha Bsinha 1 RVA2B2sin haP 1  1 where tan 3  J RED cos haE sin h  RD2E2sin  1 where tan 31 J zRG cos hHsin hc RVaG2H2 sin h  c 3   1I where tan 3H  As the angles a 3  and 1 may be regarded as constant for a single day the equa tions I 1 1 show that the deviations of the magnets from their normal positions at any two hours whose interval is half a day are equal in amount but opposite in direc tion for each element of the earths force but this is quite at variance with the real character of the diurnal variations the excursions of the magnets being invariably extensive on both sides of their normal positions during about eight hours of the day which include the suns upper transit while deviations of comparatively small extent occur during the remaining hours This discordance will be more conclusively shown if we express the observed variations in the form of the series y described hereafter 17 when the coefficients of the second and following terms should be zero while we find that those of the second and third terms have magnitudes not greatly inferior to the coefficient of the first term Again it will be shown hereafter 19 that there should be no mean diurnal varia tion for the whole year due to direct action of the sun while in fact there is such a variation of very considerable range in middle and high magnetic latitudes which is opposite in character for the north and south magnetic hemispheres With respect to the direct action of the sun upon the observed magnets the first of the abovementioned reasons was adduced by Dr LLOYD as showing the inconsistency with observation in the law of the diurnal variations as derived from the theory in ques tion in a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy February 22 1858 The same conclusion is here extended by the aid of POISsoNS formula to the inducing action of the sun upon the soft iron of the earth The hypothesis of the 505MR C CHAMBERS ON THE NATURE OF THE magnetic nature of the sun cannot therefore by itself be accepted as an explanation of the diurnal variations of the earths magnetism 9 It may be argued however that the diurnal variations are the combined effects of direct solar action and of other forces whose origin and nature are unknown but if this be the case I think we have reason for believing that the portion of the variations which proceeds from the former source is small in comparison with the part which is due to the other forces that are in operation 10 Returning now to the equation l if R and c be any particular values of R and a and any other values be R and a0y we shall have in the latter case  yA2B2 sin h coyf3  and if 3c P RyA2B2 sin hr3t Hence it appears that when Ro and  are changed to R and ooy the range of variation is altered in the proportion of R to Ro and the hour at which the maximum deviation occurs is advanced by the equivalent in time to the angle y As we are only seeking the law of variation and not absolute quantities we may reject the constant factor VA2B2 when p becomes 4R sin h y3    t 12 Now let us observe that the period embraced by a large mass of hourly observa tions extending over several years comprises many revolutions of the sun on its axis the suns period of rotation being about twentyfive days and that it is from such extended series of observations that the determinations of the regular diurnal variations which we shall use for comparison with the results of our hypothesis are derived 13 As the distance of the sun from the earth is great in relation to the diameter of the sun we may assume in the calculation of the magnetic force exerted by the sun upon the earth that the suns free magnetism is accumulated in the extremities of a straight line whose middle point passes through the suns centre and this supposed magnet may be resolved into two others one having its poles in the suns axis of rotation the other with its poles in the plane of the suns equator Now as regards the latter if we notice its effect upon the earth when its north end points towards the earth it is evident that when the sun has made somewhat more than half a revolution upon its axis the south end will point towards the earth and the opposite effect be produced and similarly for every position of this magnet there is another position when the sun has advanced about 180 in rotation in which the effect neutralizes that of the former position 14 It is necessary therefore to consider only the magnetism of the sun parallel to its axis of rotation as affecting the mean diurnal variations on the earths surface Now we have no means of finding the absolute magnetic force of the sun neither do we require it what we want is the law of change of direction and intensity of the force exerted by the sun upon the centre of the earth as the earth revolves in its orbit and this we can easily calculate from the known elements of position of the suns axis which by 506SUNS MAGNETIC ACTION UPON THE EARTH Mr CARRINGTONS latest determinations are Inclination of suns axis to plane of ecliptic i82 45 Longitude of projection of northern half of suns axis

not required in the application that we are to make of the formule 17 Let us now turn our attention to the results of observation as to the diurnal variations General SABINE has discussed this subject very fully for the observations made at the British Colonial Observatories of Toronto St Helena Hobarton c After a careful separation of disturbed observations he has given hourly mean values of the deviations of the observed magnets from their normal positions or their equivalents expressed in terms of the earths force for every month of the year the means being deduced from several years observations Now if from the mean hourly deviations for a given month we determine by the MDCCCLXIII 3 z 509MR C CHAMBERS ON THE NATURE OF THE method of least squares the constants in a series of the form AhB sin h6C sin 2 heD sin 3hi c   y where A is the deviation at any hour h of the day it is easy to show that the values of the constants in any one term are independent of the values of those in any other term if the data are complete for all the twentyfour hours and if the series be not carried beyond a term W sin 23h  18 We have proved 16 that the variation due to direct and inducing action of the sun is of the form xRsinhy     and therefore we see that the first term of the series y includes the whole of this action the remaining terms being unaffected by it Moreover the equations x show us that the part of the term B sin h   which is due to direct solar action varies as Ry and has its maximum advanced as y increases Thus we are led to expect changes in B and 6 from month to month which shall accord with the corresponding variations of RKy and y and the degree of accordance which is found to exist will serve to indicate the extent to which the direct and inducing action of the sun bears a part in the production of the regular diurnal variations 19 We see from Table II that the values of Ry for January and July are nearly equal and that the angle y for the former month differs by about 1800 from its value for the latter month consequently there should be no mean diurnal variation or a very small one for these two months inasmuch as the hour of maximum deviation in the one is the same as the hour of minimum in the other the magnitude of the deviations being nearly alike in the two months the same observation holds with regard to any two months separated by an interval of half a year and thus we perceive that the nzean diurnal variation for the whole year due to direct action of the sun should be extremely small and that without sensible error we may omit the consideration of it We may therefore separate from the quantity B sin h8 for the different months its normal value for the year calling the remaining quantities B sin h  and we shall then have to consider only the latter numbers for comparison with Ry and y for the reason just stated Now it is probable from the simplicity of the instrument used and its independence of temperature corrections that no periodical magnetic variations are so well deter mined as the diurnal variations of declination We shall therefore confine ourselves to the examination of the variations of that element for which the following Table gives the monthly values of B and 6 at Toronto and St Helena these being derived from tables of variations given by General SABINE in his discussions of the observations made at the observatories of Toronto and St Helena published for the British Government by LONGMAN and Co London Positive values of B sin hY indicate easterly devia tions of the north end of the declination magnet 510SUNS MAGNETIC ACTION UPON THE EARTH TABLE III Toronto St Helena B  V B Z January  1208 24 20 627 349 48 February  883 35 44 916 347 8 March  467 188

table of numbers the curve Plate XXV fig 1 is constructed to represent the successive values of ER and y in this figure the lines rl r2    r12 are proportional to R and the angles A rl A r 2   Ar12 are equal to the angle y for January February   December respectively The curves of figs 2  3 which are formed in a similar manner from the numbers in the preceding Table are intended to show the variations of B and Y Drawing lines r G r H at right angles to r G and r H respectively it is easy to see from the form of the expression B sin h that the angles Gr 1 Gr 2  Gr12 reckoned by a righthanded revolution from Gr represent the hourangles of the sun at the time of the occurrence of the maximum deviation in the respective months from January to December and that the extent of that deviation is represented by the lines r 1 r 2  r 12 respectively and similarly for fig 3 21 Now we see that direct action of the sun is not the sole cause of the variations of the term B sin h because in that case fig 1 which represents the variations of the cause would be similar to figs 2  3 which represent the variations of the effect but would not be similarly situated unless the angle S happened to be equal to G r I or Hrl and we find but little appearance of similarity displayed by the curves the extent of the likeness will be exhibited more distinctly in what follows We may here state that if the quantity I were negative it would only have the effect of increasing P by 180 22 The lines CD E F in figs 2  3 have that direction which gives the sum of the squares of the perpendiculars let fall upon them from the points 1 2   12 a mini mum and it is very noticeable that the points are arranged in closer proximity to these lines than to lines at right angles to C D and E F the points 10 11 12 1 2 being 3z2 511MR C CHAMBERS ON THE NATUIRE OF THE generally towards one extremity of the lines while the remaining points are towards the opposite extremity The expression B

easterly declination when h 90o its coefficient being the resolved part of the lines r 1 r2   r 12 along CD or E F and the latter term represents the part of the variation of Bsin hS which gives a maximum of declination when h a and its coefficient is the resolved part of r 1 r 2  r 12 at right angles to C D or E F The following Table shows the values of B cos    and B sin d r for the different

monthly variation of these numbers is indi cated by curves whose vertical ordinates are proportional to the numbers positive values being reckoned upwards and the abscissae are divided into twelve equal parts to represent the successive months of the year 23 Remembering what was said in art 19 we see that if a straight line be drawn in any direction through the point r of fig 1 it divides the curve into two sets of six con secutive months and that if perpendiculars be drawn from the points 1 2 3  12 to that line their lengths are least in the extreme months on each side of the line and increase to maxima and then diminish as the numbers increase there being only one maximum on each side Now as this is true of any line these conditions must be fulfilled whatever be the value of the angle P by the ordinates of figs 5 6 7  8 if the variations which the curves represent are due to direct action of the sun and if we confine our attention to figs 5  7 these conditions are satisfied in a remarkable manner but as we have found that they are to be demanded alike from figs 6  8 512SUNS MAGNETIC ACTION UPON THE EARTH before we can admit the truth of the hypothesis let us see whether these curves also exhibit the required form 24 In the first place we observe that the range of these curves is much smaller than that of figs 5  7 and still smaller than the whole diurnal range of declination at the two stations and therefore even if the curves had the required form we should still have reason to believe that the direct effect of the sun was less than that of other forces in operation For the ratio of the mean ordinate disregarding signs of fig 6 is to that of fig 5 as I to 42 and the corresponding ratio for figs 8  7 is as 1 to 5 3 while the least possible ratio of the mean ordinates upon rectangular diameters of fig 1 is as 1 to 27 and therefore under the most favourable supposition as to the value of the angle 3 the mean ordinates of figs 5  7 should be considerably less or those of figs 6  8 greater in order that the results of observation should accord with the hypo thesis But figs 6  8 are far from fulfilling the conditions named as regards the form of the curves for we see that neither of them has but a single maximum or a single minimum ordinate nor are six consecutive months above and six below the horizontal line deviating most from that line in the middle months of each group of six The general appearance of figs 6  8 conveys the impression that the numbers which they represent are possibly errors in the determinations of the respective values of B and Y arising perhaps from the uneliminated part of the disturbances but if it were possible to decompose them into two parts one obeying the required law of variation and another following some other law it is probable that the mean ordinate corre sponding to the former part would be much less than the mean of the combined ordi nates hence it is probable that there is but little trace of direct solar action to be found in the regular diurnal variations of declination at Toronto and St Helena 25 It may be objected however that the agreement of figs 5  7 with the require ments of the hypothesis does not appear as well in figs 6  8 because the other variable forces in operation act in partial opposition to the sun and so mask the character which figs 6  8 would have if those opposing forces could be separated To this objection it will be sufficient to reply that the variations of the quantities corresponding to B cos a a for the second and third terms of the series y have a similar character to those of the first term and it appears reasonable therefore to infer that the same variable force is the cause of the variations of each of the three terms but the second and third terms have been proved 18 to be independent of direct action of the sun hence it is most probable that the variations of B sin fo though they accord with the hypothesis of direct solar action are due to some different cause The similarity of the variations of B cos a is shown by the curves of figs 9  11 Plate XXVII in continuous black red and interrupted black lines which have reference to the first second and third terms of y respectively Figs 10  12 are similar representations of the variations of B sin   for the first three terms of y and it is observable that these are quite different one from another In Table V are given the numbers from which the curves of figs 9 10 11  12 are constructed 513514 MR C CHAMBERS ON THE NATURE OF THE TABLE VShowing the variations of

figs 9 10 11  12 is that as those of figs 9  11 exhibit a remarkable likeness of character while those of figs 10  12 present little appearance of similarity the former are probably representa tives of true changes while the latter may perhaps be regarded as errors in the deter minations when we obtain the following approximate expression for the variable part of the diurnal variations in any month of the year AB sin hacC sin 2 hPD sin 3 hyc where A alone varies from month to month being sometimes positive and sometimes negative If we might regard this as a true statement it would follow as the law of variation remains constant throughout the year the range only altering that these variations do not result from those of different forces but from those of a single force or of a group of connected forces 26 Having seen that it is probable that if the sun be a magnetic body its direct magnetic influence upon the earth as evinced by the regular diurnal variations is very small I think we may safely infer that terrestrial magnetic disturbances are not caused by variations in the magnetism of the sun for if the whole direct action of the sun at ordinary times be insensible much more will the changes which take place in the suns magnetic state be insensible in their effects upon the earth as it would be difficult to conceive that the changes in question were ever of such magnitude as to approach the effect of reversing the suns ordinary magnetic condition 27 I conclude therefore that the mode in which forces originating in the sun influence the magnetic condition of the earth is not analogous to the action of a magnet upon a mass of soft iron placed at a great distance from it but that these forces pro ceed from the sun in a form different from that of magnetic force and are converted into the latter form of force probably by their action upon the matter of the earth or its atmosphere  SUNS MAGNETIC ACTION UPON THE EARTH 515 On the eistence of a variation of diurnal range of Declination at St Helena depending on the Suns altitude When we express the diurnal variations of declination at St Helena for the different months of the year in the form y AB sin hSC sin 2hsD sin 3hi the values of the coefficients B C D are seen to be larger about the time when at noon the sun is overhead at St Helena which occurs in the first weeks of February and November than they are immediately before or after This fact indicates the existence of a secondary variation of the diurnal range of declination which has maximum values at the times mentioned and which is additional to the variation of range caused by the semiannual inequality discovered by General SABINE The monthly values of B C and D are shown in the following Table B C D January  703 726 622

repetition of the observations but as the three coefficients agree in giving the same testimony I think we must allow it to be not merely an apparent but a real variation Before concluding I must acknowledge the important help that I have derived from Mr ARCHIBALD SMITHS  Mathematical Theory of the Errors of Ships Compasses of which what has preceded is little more than an application to another purpose I am also indebted to Mr THOMAS W BAKER of the Kew Observatory for the very efficient assistance which he has afforded me in the rather laborious computations involved in the discussion Note on  26 and 27 By Professor W THOMSON MA LLD PRS Received October 28 1863 If the sun were a magnet as intense on the average as the earth the magnetic force it would exert at a distance equal to the earths or let us suppose 200 radii would be516 ON THE NATURE OF THE SUNS MAGNETIC ACTION UPON THE EARTH only 8To0000T Of the earths surface magnetic force in the corresponding position rela tively to its magnetic axis Considering therefore according to the principles explained by Mr CHAMBERS the sun as a magnet having its magnetic axis nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic we see that with an average intensity of magnetization equal to the earths the effect of reversing the suns magnetization would be to introduce in a direction perpendicular to the ecliptic a disturbing force equal to about 800oooo00 of the earths average polar force and would therefore be absolutely insensible to the most delicate terrestrial magnetic observation yet practised A disturbing force of this amount acting perpendicularly to the direction of the terrestrial magnetic force about the equator would produce a disturbance in declination of only half a second and the suns mag netization would therefore need to be 120 times as intense as the earths to produce a disturbance of 1 in declination even by a complete reversal in the most favourable circumstances These estimates appear to me to give strong evidence in support of the conclusion at which Mr CHAMBERS has arrived by a careful examination of the disturb ances actually observed that no effect of the suns action as a magnet is sensible at the earth The same estimates are applicable to the moon her apparent diameter being the same as the suns It is of course most probable that the moon is a magnet but she must be a magnet thousands or millions of times more intense than the earth to produce any sensible effect of the character of any of the observed terrestrial magnetic disturbances   fr SH TorcrdxA     Ii I ii I I II

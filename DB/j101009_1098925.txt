ARE GERMANE TO THE ISSUE DOWNER  CO V MORRISON 2 GRATT 250 THE CASE THEN BEFORE THE JURY WAS THAT MARTIN OETERS HAVING TAKEN OUT A BENEFIT CERTIFICATE IN THE KNIGHTS OF HONOR WAS SUSPENDED ON JANUARY 1 1895 FOR THE NON PAYMENT OF THE ASSESSMENTS MADE AGAINST HIM IN DECEMBER 1894 AND WAS THEREFORE NOT A MEMBER OF THE ORDER AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH SEE KNIGHTS OF HONOR V OETERS 95 VA 610 THE JUDGMENT OF THE LAW AND EQUITY COURT IS AFFIRMED AFFIRMED NOTETHAT UNDER A PLEA OF NONASSUMPSIT A STATEMENT OF THE GROUND OF THE DEFENCE FILED BY ORDER OF COURT UNDER AUTHORITY OF THE STATUTE DOES NOT SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF FROM THE PLAINTIFF TO THE DEFENDANT EVEN THOUGH THE STATED DEFENCE REST UPON NEW AND AFFIRMATIVE MATTER WOULD SEEM TO BE A SOUND PROPO SITION AND FULLY JUSTIFIED BY THE REASON ASSSIGNED BY THE COURT WITH THE BURDEN OF PROOF ON THE PLAINTIFF AT THE BEGINNINGA BURDEN PROPERLY HELD NOT SHIFTED BY THE PLEADINGSTHE QUESTION WHETHER MERE PROOF THAT THE IN SURED WAS ONCE A MEMBER IN GOOD STANDING OF THE DEFENDANT COMPANY WAS SUF FICIENT TO SUSTAIN A RECOVERY WOULD SEEM TO BE NOT A DIFFICULT ONE THAT THERE WAS NO PRESUMPTION OF PROMPTNESS IN THE PAYMENT OF DUES OR OF THE INSUREDS HAVING RE MAINED A MEMBER IN GOOD STANDING UNTIL HIS DEATH BUT THAT THIS MUST BE PROVED AFFIRMATIVELYA GROUND UPON WHICH THE COURT MIGHT HAVE BASED ITS DECISION SEEMS TO BE A MUCH SAFER AND SIMPLER PROPOSITION THAN THAT UPON WHICH THE COURT CHOSE TO REST ITS CONCLUSIONS THE GROUND CHOSEN WAS THAT LETTERS FROM THE DE FENDANT COMPANY TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INSURED WRITTEN AFTER THE LATTERS 102 JUNEDEATHAND INTRODUCED IN EVIDENCE BY THE PLAINTIFFIN WHICH LETTERS THE DEFEN DANT COMPANY ALLEGES A LAPSE OF MEMBERSHIP FOR NONPAYMENT OF DUESCONSTITUTE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT ALLEGED THE CASE OF DOWNER V MORRISON 2 GRATT 250 UPON WHICH THE COURT RELIES FOR THIS PROPOSITION IS AN UNSATISFACTORY ONE AT BEST SO FAR AS THE OPINION GOES SINCE NO REASONS ARE ASSIGNED FOR THE DECISION BUT THE POINT RULED IN THAT CASE DIFFERS SOMEWHAT FROM THAT FOR WHICH IT IS CITED IN PRINCIPAL CASE IN THE FORMER THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER THE DEFENDANTS KNEW THAT GOODS RECEIVED BY THEM FROM A THIRD PERSON HAD BEEN PURCHASED IN THEIR NAME AND BEHALF BY SUCH PERSON AS THEIR AGENT AND THAT THE PLAINTIFFS LOOKED TO THEM AND NOT TO SUCH ALLEGED AGENT FOR PAYMENT IT WAS HELD THAT A LETTER FROM THE PLAINTIFFS TO THE DEFENDANTS PROVED TO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY THE DEFENDANTS FROM THE CONTENTS OF WHICH LETTER SUCH NOTICE MIGHT BE INFERRED WAS PROPER EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFFS  UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FOR THE PURPOSES STATED IN THE BILL OF EXCEPTIONS WHAT THIS PURPOSE WAS THE REPORT OF THE CASE DOES NOT DISCLOSE BUT WE APPREHEND THAT THE LETTER WAS PROPER EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE PLAINTIFFS HAD BROUGHT HOME TO THE DEFENDANTS NOTICE THAT THE ALLEGED AGENT WAS PURCHASING IN THEIR NAME WHY THE PLAINTIFF SAW FIT TO INTRODUCE THE DEFENDANTS LETTERS IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE DOES NOT APPEAR BUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOWING BY THE ADMIS SIONS THEREIN OF THE DEFENDANT COMPANY THAT THE DECEASED WAS A MEMBER IN GOOD STANDING UP TO JANUARY 1 1895 THE DATE OF HIS SUSPENSION AS INDICATED IN THE LETTERS TO HOLD THAT BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE LETTERS OF THE DEFENDANT CON TAINING ADMISSIONS AGAINST INTEREST SELFSERVING DECLARATIONS THEREIN BECAME AFFIRMA TIVE EVIDENCE IN THE DEFENDANTS BEHALF BEYOND THEIR EFFECT AS OFFSETS TO THE ADMIS SIONS IS EXTENDING THE RULE THAT ADMISSIONS MUST BE TAKEN AS A WHOLE TO AN EXTREME LIMIT THE DECISION ON THE MERITS IS MANIFESTLY RIGHT BUT WITH GREAT DEFERENCE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLACED ON THE GROUND THAT THE PLAINTIFF FAILED TO PROVE HIS CASE RATHER THAN THAT THE DEFENDANT PREVAILED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE

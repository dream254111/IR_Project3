j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1014593,Shall Corporations Be Authorized to Practise Engineering,i242692,Shall Corporations Be Authorized to Practise Engineering By WILLIAM J WILGUS Consulting Engineer New York City SHOULD a corporation practise en gineering The layman will per haps at first thought reply in the affirmative always with the provision however that the engineering service so rendered conforms with the best professional standards of practice and yet the question is by no means so easily answered when considered from all sides and especially from the point of view of public expediency Is it not generally recognized that a corporation is organized and adminis tered primarily for gain We are not here speaking of that class of corpora tions which serve a philanthropic or charitable cause but of the everyday business corporation aggressively on the makes as it were and reaching out vigorously to increase its power and earning capacity All such corpora tions of this latter class as are ably administered strive to perform some economically useful service Those wholly or partly engaged in engineer ing doubtless endeavor to furnish their clients or customers with engineering advice and skill consistent with the highest standards of the engineering profession But considering the very nature of the corporation is it possible to accomplish this purpose May we not draw this comparison between the purposes of a corporation and those of a profession On the one hand a profession is commonly re garded as and may be defined as a vocation having to do with the instruct ing guiding and advising of others or with serving them in some art calling vocation or employment within the limitations not only of law but also of rules or standards known as a code of ethics On the other hand a typical engineering corporation is organized and its work carried on for the purposeSHALL CORPORATIONS PRACTISE ENGINEERING 95 of monetary gain It functions of course within the limits proscribed by law but it is not a subscriber speaking broadly to any code of ethics profes sional or otherwise It acts as a cor porate entity and the liability of its individual owners is strictly limited In a sense it is an instrument often with large financial responsibility but without soul Its policies are of neces sity those dictated by expediency from its own selfinterested standpoints its object dividends and these as large as is consistent with sound commercial policy It has been well said that business has gain as its principal aim while a profession has service as its lodestar with gain as a byproduct THE CONFLICT OF INTERESTS An engineer retained by his client occupies the same relative position as the lawyer or doctor His clients in terests are his interests in so far as they are compatible with truth ethics and scientific knowledge His work is the solution of the engineering problems of the undertaking in such manner as to provide for his client engineering skill unbiased by selfinterest and free from any outside influence or pressure which could be detrimental to his client Not so the corporation with an en gineering staff highly skilled though it may be financed by bankers and per haps influenced and even controlled by manufacturers Here we have many interests and often those of the engi neering staff ordinarily supposed to represent the client that is to say the public are sadly subordinate The manufacturers believe their products to be the best obtainable for the pur poses of the client Why then should not the engineers which the cor poration employs be requested to specify them When we consider the position of the individuals composing the engineering staff of such a company we recognize at once the fact that there are two masters to be served Is it re markable that the interests of the client inevitably suffer under such condi tions In view of the arguments thus far presented it seems fair to assume that no group of nonengineers can hope under the guise of an engineering cor poration to offer engineering services without at least arousing suspicion as to their real purposes It is emphati cally not in the public interest for a corporation ostensibly to pose as a pro fessional body when its allied or col lateral interests are such as to influence its engineering judgment Engineers with a full appreciation of the ethics of their profession resent undue influence exerted upon them which will in any way hamper their freedom of action or of thought It is therefore difficult to see how these engineering corporations are to provide themselves with the highest grade of engineering talent or indeed with any engineers at all except those who are willing to subject them selves and their work to the suspicion of improper influence on the part of their employers The following quotation from a let ter addressed to the Governor of New York by a committee of leading en gineers forcefully presents arguments against the licensing of corporations for the practice of engineering What is viewed by us with alarm is the sanctioning of a condition under which an engineering corporation may have bankers manufacturers and contractors on its board who may so dominate its policy as to in fluence its management including its en gineering employes in the preparation of reports plans contracts and specifications and in the supervision of work in such man ner as to favor the outside interests of such directors to the injury of the client the public This is no idle fear In the case of common carriers this practice of interlock ing directorates is forbidden by law96 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The professional engineer in the employ of an engineering corporation or unre stricted partnership made up in whole or part of nonengineers is relegated to a posi tion of anonymity or that of the servant relieving him of all professional responsi bility to the client and placing him under the direction of those whose primary inter est is a bankers or contractors profit The professional engineer who signs a report or an engineering plan or specifica tion is personally responsible The engineer who works for an engineering corporation controlled by bankers or contractors is re sponsible only to the corporation upon which no equivalent responsibility is im posed by the State In a word the engineering corporation by which the engineer is employed or with which he is associated is responsible only in a legal sense and cannot be held for vio lations of a code of ethics to which it is not a subscriber The interposition of the impersonal cor poration between the client and the pro fessional engineer frees the latter from the responsibility for the unprofessional acts of his employer Corporations are free blatantly to adver tise and to solicit patronage while inde pendent engineers are restrained from doing so either by good taste or by profes sional ethics In fact there are wellknown instances of practices by engineering cor porations and unrestricted partnerships which are in direct violation of the profes sional ethics to which some of their officers or members in their individual capacities have subscribed This is unfair to the in dependent engineer and destructive of that high respect for the profession which is of public concern It has been said that the public interest will be best promoted by recognizing by law the right of corporations to practice the profession of engineering because the tend ency of the times is in the direction of the performance of work by corporate aggrega tions of capital and brains not feasible in the case of the individual or independent engineer This may perhaps be effectively answered by pointing to recent work of great magnitude performed under the direc tion of independent engineers as follows 1 Barge and ship canals including ter minals 2 Catskill Water Supply 3 Subway system of the City of New York 4 Great tunnels and bridges 5 Great railway terminals including the Grand Central and Pennsylvania Railroad New York terminals 6 Electrification of steam railroads in cluding the New York Central Pennsyl vania and Long Island railroads with their collateral improvements 7 Rehabilitation of great trunk lines for heavy motive power 8 Vast system of highway improve ments 9 Port railroad and other construction required for our Army at home and abroad A further answer to this statement lies in recent disclosures in the business world Certainly it is not in the public interest to favor the interposition of ethiclessbusiness between the professional engineer and the public It would be clearly wrong to restrict or hinder the employment in a profes sional capacity of engineers by corpo rations but it is certainly not in ac cordance with engineering ethics for these corporatiors to offer the services of their employed engineers to the pub lic nor is it for the public good The corporation composed entirely of en gineers all adhering to the recognized standards of professional ethics and without entangling alliances may be able to render effective service There seems to be no adequate grounds however for the incorporation of such a body of engineers and there are strong reasons against it chief of which perhaps is the suspicion rightly or wrongly attached by the public to any corporate body posing as profes sional and professing its allegiance to professional ideals

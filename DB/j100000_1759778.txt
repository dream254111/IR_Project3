enabled it to show an increase of 81 of dry matter containing 018 of a gram of nitrogen These facts admit of but one conclusion viz that peas are able to assimilate the nitrogen contained in the soil much more readily than is barley The fact that the peaplant contains much more nitrogen than the barleyplant does not show that peas should receive much more nitrogenous manure than barley but on the contrary that they can readily supply themselves with nitrogen but need to be manured with potash and particularly with phosphoric acid Barley on the other hand contains little nitrogen partly because it cannot gather it readily and therefore it needs an artificial supply In other words the greater need of nitrogen on the part of the peas corresponds to a greater power of obtaining it It is of course unsafe to generalize from these two experiments At the same time their results correspond so exactly with the teachings of experi ence regarding the most suitable manuring for legumes and cereals respectively and appear apriori so probable that one can hardly avoid a strong belief in their general application They certainly open an interesting and important field for further research If it can be shown that in manuring any given plant we ought to direct our attention more particularly to those elements of its food which it contains in rela tively small quantity rather than to those present in abundance we shall have made a very considerable advance in our knowledge of the theory of manures H P ARMSBY KOCHS WORK UPON TUBERCULOSIS AND THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE QUESTION THE question of the cause of that form of disease known as tuberculosis is one which has been the subject of discussion in medical circles for many years It is of especial interest to the laity because in one of its forms it includes the affection so widely known as consumption of the lungs or phthisis The idea of a contagious nature as belonging to this process ie to tuberculosis was first broached in modern times by Villeminl as the result of a series of 1 Gazette medicale de Paris December 1865 fitudes sur la tuberculose Paris 1808 NCE 59 experiments upon animals conducted by him These experiments attracted very great attention at the time and were subsequently repeated with varying degrees of success and failure by numerous observ ers Twentyfive years before Villemins experiments were announced Klencke 1 claimed to have produced tuberculosis in animals rabbits by the inoculation of tuberculous matter His results do not however seem to have received the attention which they de served and it is to Villemin that is usually ascribed the beginining of the line of experiment which has resulted in the work which is under consideration today Among those who have taken up the question of the specific nature of tuberculosis in inoculation ex periments may be especially mentioned Waldenburg Klebs Cohnheim Frankel and Baumgarten In halation experiments in which the disease is sought to be communicated by forcing animals to inhale finely divided dried tuberculous materials have been tried again and again with as conflicting results as in the preceding series Those who have done the most noteworthy work in this direction are Schot telius Tappeiner Weigert Weichselbaum and Balogh Feedingexperiments form the third class by which an endeavor to obtain evidence for or against the specific nature of tuberculosis has been made It is unnecessary to do more than mention the names of a few of those who have taken a prominent part in this branch of the investigation such are Aufrecht Klebs Bollinger Colin Tappeiner and Toussaint These names forming but a small part of the cata logue of those who have been interested in the study of tuberculosis will give some indication of the vast amount of work done and the interest taken in this subject After Villemins experiments and coincident with all the work that was called out by them the ques tion of the nature of the virus of tuberculosis was eagerly discussed The idea of a contagium vivumn was first suggested by Buhl2 who claimed to have observed microorganisms constantly occurring in tu berculous nodules these microorganisms being both micrococci and bacteria This idea was taken up by Klebs3 who claimed to have isolated a micrococcus by culture and to have produced tuberculosis by the inoculation of this organism Klebss experiments were repeated and with the same or nearly the same successful results by Schneller4 Reinstadler5 and Deutschmann6 The acceptance of this monas tuber culosum as it was called as the specific cause of the tuberculous process was not general however and for various reasons the work of Klebs seems to be untrustworthy 1 Untersuchungen un erfahrungen

and the contradictory and conflicting results derived from them were being given to the world other experi ments were being conducted the results of which were not announced as the work progressed but were kept from publication until they had been verified in the most complete manner that modern methods would permit These experiments were those of Robert Koch conducted by him at the laboratory of the German board of health in Berlin and pursued with unremitting diligence and care for over two years The results were first made public under the modest title of The etiology of tuberculosis at a meeting of the Berlin physiological society in March 1882 and were published in the Berliner klinische wochenschrift 1882 No 15 His method of work was as follows  Starting with the assumption that a microorgan ism might be at the bottom of the disease he care fully searched for some evidence to support this theory by microscopic investigation of large numbers of tuberculous tissues from various sources As a result he found that with favorable illumination of the specimen and good lenses it was possible to make out the almost constant presence in tuberculous tis sues of a rodlike organism much smaller and finer than most of those that had hitherto been observed The occurrence of this organism was found to be so frequent and in such early stages of the disease that a suspicion of its causal relation to the pathological process was forced upon him The discovery of the existence of this bacterium was but the beginning of the investigation however and the masterly series of experiments by which he went on to prove its specific relationship must be read to be appreciated In the first place it was necessary to isolate this organism from its surroundings and to propagate it by itself that is to produce a pure culture The best means to do this could only be ascertained by experiment and after the conclusion of these ex periments his results were these The organism was found to flourish best at a temperature of from 360 to 40 C  a much higher range than is neces sary for most forms of bacteria This being ascer tainled it was necessary to find some suitable culture soil upon which the organism could flourish for the ordinary gelatine media would not remain solid at this temperature Here it was found that the serum of the blood of sheep or cattle was the best medium to be employed for by exposure to a comparatively low temperature 65 C it would gradually solidify until at the end of a few hours of such exposure it would become a transparent ambercolored mass of a jellylike consistency of course remaining solid at a lower temperature for any length of time After this was done there was still another peculiarity of this organism to be appreciated and that was its slow growth Up to this time bacteria were supposed to complete the cycle of their existence in a very short time usually measured by minutes occasionally by hours In this case however there was some thing entirely different and it was not until after a NCE VOL IV No 76 large number of experiments had failed that it was realized that they were dealing with an organism re quiring from a week to ten days for any appreciable increase in its numbers to occur Having found out all these peculiarities it re mained to study what happened in the culture apparatus as time went on It was found that it required from two to three weeks for such a growth to take place upon the surface of the culturemedium that a portion could be transferred to another nutri tive soil and a new culture started it was found that the growth occurred in dry whitishgray scales that under a low power of the microscope were seen to be rather of a sigmoid form and it was found that when these scales were transferred to other soil and broken up each fragment would produce like scales and that this method of propagation could be kept up for months at a time Inoculation of animals of vari ous kinds with material from these cultures at any and all stages of their growth done under the most rigid precautions for the exclusion of any impurities or possibly specific matter was found invariably to produce the disease tuberculosis The tissues of these animals when killed presented the nodular appearances peculiar to the disease and in these nodules were always found organisms exactly similar to those which had been injected Cultures of these organisms showed exactly the same peculiarities as in the first instance and inoculations with the result of these cultures produced the same pathological ap pearances In order to prove that these organisms alone would produce the disease Koch used other substances than tuberculous matter for inoculation and these sub stances being proven by microscopic examination to contain no organisms and being protected from ex ternal contamination by all known precautions gave entirely negative results and in no case was tubercu losis produced On the other hand in no case was there a failure to produce the disease when materi als containing the organism or the organism itself were employed as the inoculating material Thus it will be seen that the conditions necessary for the establishment of a specific causal relationship between a microorganism and a given disease were fulfilled in this case so far as itewas possible for one observer to bring them about The constant occur rence of an organism in the varying forms of the dis ease in animals and in man its isolation from the tissues and reproduction by artificial means its in troduction into healthy animals with the resulting pathological processes exactly similar to the original disease its discovery in these inoculated animals and its reisolation and observation  all these require ments have been repeatedly fulfilled in the case of the bacillus of tuberculosis together with that other trying one that materials proven to contain no bacilli invariably fail to act in any specific man ner Not content with the work thus announced Koch went on for a year longer with his experiments the results of which were collected in July of last year but have only recently reached American readers i JJULY 18 1884 SCIE in the second volume of the Gelrman health re ports1 In this article Koch reaffirms his original announcement and gives the results of further work in the same direction all reached by experiments conducted with the same precision as the first se ries They bear out his assertions to the full and with the exception of a few slight changes of tech nique and a modification of the staining methods employed have led him to no change whatever in regard to his views as first expressed more than two years ago These two papers taken together form a monument of scientific accuracy and care and so far as subse quent investigations go will carry conviction to the mind of any impartial judge Confirmatory evidence as regards the occurrence of the organism in ques tion in tuberculous lesions has been offered upon all sides and in enormous mass The real evidence however the repetition of the culture and inocula tion experiments is sadly deficient This is perhaps not to be wondered at because the apparatus neces sary is so extensive the training so severe and the aptitude for the work so rare In addition to all this the time necessary for the experiments is so great that the chances are that they never will be repeated to their full extent although it is only by such thor ough and exhaustive investigation that progress in this branch of scientific medicine can be expected Some few observers have pretended to upset the con clusions of Koch upon the basis of extremely unsatis factory and incomplete observations Spina of Vienna is or was a prominent champion of this class His book was announced with a flourish as being in tended to overturn and as actually accomplishing the destruction of all Kochs theories Upon its pub lication it was found to be nothing but a criticism of methods that Koch himself acknowledged to be faulty and a few observations upon the occurrence of the bacillus but with an entire absence of any culture or properly conducted inoculation experi ments whatever in all respects being so far below the work it was meant to criticise that it was with pain and mortification that we heard it mentioned on the same plane in the annual address to the Massachusetts medical society of this year This however seems to be the limit of any noteworthy objections in Europe in this country it is different a number of gentlemen having considered themselves authorized to speak in opposition to Kochs views upon the ground of personal observations For the most part however their pretensions are too weak to receive serious notice as for example Schmidts cry of  fat crystals Greggs of  fibrine filaments Cutters of Mycoderma aceti or Formads of narrow lymphspaces It is perhaps hardly fair to speak of Formads deplorable failure to maintain his opposition to Koch by any reasonable arguments at the last annual session of the American medical association Through imperfect counsel the gentle man was induced to come before the meeting and after announcing far and wide his intention to give 1 Mittheilungen aus dem rais gesundheit bd ii 1884 NCE 61 results that would destroy the last vestige of strength to Kochs assertion in regard to the specific nature of the bacillus of tuberculosis instead of doing this proceeded to read a reprint of an article published by him last fall announcing that his results would be published in the near future This in the present condition of all questions relating to microorgan isms in this country seems to be almost inexcusable These results have been promised for Inonths and at the time of writing have not yet appeared It seems as if it were the bounden duty of all those honestly interested in the advancement of scientific knowledge to talk and publish less and to work more What is needed is the publication of the results of work carefully and conscientiously performed to gether with the exact details of every step in every process by which those results were reached In addition to this we have a right to demand that all work of this kind shall be done by trained observers in the presence of others equally well qualified for the observation not with and by halftrained students  and that the very best appliances of modern research shall be employed in each and every observation made In this way and in this way only can reliance be placed upon observations re corded in work on microorganisms and it is the absence of work of this kind which gives so very little force to the opponents of the specific nature of the bacillus of tuberculosis At the same time it is the presence of this very accuracy of the detailed ac count of every step in the process by which the results were reached and of the completeness of the ex periments and control experiments that gives the convincing power to Kochs work Nothing that can be for an instant compared with it for simplicity and directness of statement or completeness of detail has yet beeni brought forward by his opponents Until that is done and it does not look probable at the present writing his work must be accepted as con clusive and measures should be taken to control to some extent the widespread destruction of this disease as it is most certainly within our power to do Kochs own work upon the subject of tuberculosis has been suspended for a year owing to his absence in the east with the German cholera commission with which he has lately returned Whether he himself will take it up again is to be doubted for his facilities for work are unbounded and his natural impulse will of course be to open up untrodden paths of research THE GREENWICH OBSERVA TORY THE board of visitors of this institution held its annual session on Saturday June 14 and heard the report of the astronomer royal on the work of the observatory during the twelvemonth ended May 20 Of this Mr Christie says It has gone on steadily in the same lines as in former years with such small extensions in certain directions as could be made without infringing the longestablished principle that

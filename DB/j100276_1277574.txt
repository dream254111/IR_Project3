Cohen 82 W Va 284 Blodgett v Perry 97 Mo 263 and Cantley v Morgan 41 S E 201 ADVERSE POSSESSIONRECOGNITION oF TITLE IN ANOTHERTACKING Plaintiff sought to quiet title to land on theory of adverse possession the defendant holding the title of record One A had been in possession in I88o as tenant of one S In 1903 S deeded the land to A but description did not include the land in question Plaintiff derived title from A Held plaintiff has failed to show title in himself and so his action cannot be maintained Wilhelm v Herron Mich 1920 178 N W 769 It is a peculiar circumstance that the plaintiff having so many plausible theories on which he might succeed was unable to succeed on any one of them While it is true that As possession as a tenant was the possession of S yet as to everyone else it was hostile and so might ripen into title Skip with v Martin 50 Ark I4I In the principal case this possibility was denied and the court held that if anyone got title it was S The plaintiff further con tended that the adverse possession of A should be tacked to that of S and this contention may be supported either by the Kentucky theory that tacking does not require privity Shannon v Kinney I A K Marsh 3 or by the doctrine that even though privity be necessary continuity of possession by mutual con sent is sufficient McNeely v Langan 22 Oh St 32 Finally the plaintiff being in possession and title conceded to have been in S as against every one else he might well be entitled to a decree quieting title The court did not apply the doctrine that possession is good against the whole world except the true owner but maintained that as against the title of record the plaintiff must show title in himself BAILMENTSGRATUITOUS BAILOR NEmn ONLY WARN OF DEFECTS OF WHICH HE KNOWSAn owner of a motortruck gratuitously lent it to an employee to attend a celebration One riding in the truck on invitation of the borrower was killed due to a defect in the body of the truck In an action to recover damages from the bailor held the owner was not liable for failure to warn of defects of which he did not know even though he might well have known them Johnson v H M Bullard Co Conn 1920 III Atl 70 Cases involving the duties and liabilities of the gratuitous bailor are few Before the law was settled in England as to the liability of such a bailor for defects in the bailed chattel which were unknown to him it had been decided that concealment of known defects would make him liable Levy v Langridge 4 M  W 337 Winterbottom v Wright Io M  W 107 When the question arose in Blakemore v Bristol  Exeter Ry Co 8 Ellis  B 1035 as to the bailors liability for unknown defects the court accepted the principles which Pothier and Story had drawn from the Roman law and held the bailor not liable Thus we have another illustration of the influence of the Roman law upon the English law of bailments As is pointed out in the Blakemore case the fact that the bailor received nothing for the use of his chattel should render him less liable than if the bailment were for the mutual benefit of both parties It is settled that in a bailment for hire the 93MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW bailor is liable for injuries resulting from the defective condition of the thing bailed whether known or unknown if with the exercise of due care the de fect could have been discovered Moriarty v Porter 49 N Y Supp II07 In Coughlin v Gilleson I899 I Q B I45 a gratuitous lender of a donkey engine was held not liable for injuries caused from defects of which he was not aware and in McCarthy v Young 6 Hurl  N 329 a gratuitous bailor of a scaffold was not liable for an injury to the borrowers servant caused by a defect unknown to the owner The American authorities on the point seem confined to the case of Gagnor v Dana 69 N H 264 holding the bailor not liable for injuries caused by unknown defects in a staging See infra p Io8 COMMON CARRIERSTAXICAB SERvICEThe plaintiff engaged a taxicab awaiting employment at a street corner and upon reaching his destination was injured in alighting In a suit upon an accident policy stipulating double liability if injured while on a public conveyance provided by a common car rier for passenger service held the company owning the cab was a common carrier of passengers and the cab was a public conveyance Anderson v Fidelity and Casualty Co N Y I920 127 N E 584 A common carrier of passengers is one who undertakes for hire to carry all persons indifferently who may apply for passage so long as there is room and there is no legal excuse for refusing Shoemaker v Kingsbury 12 Wall U S 369 In the principal case the holding out was evidenced by the taxi cab company sending its cabs along the streets to look for fares If a carrier of goods professes to serve all indiscriminately although he does not do so he is a common carrier and not a private carrier Lloyd v Haugh 223 Pa St 148 Persons may be common carriers although they have no regular tariff of charges Jackson Architectural Iron Works v Hurlbut 158 N Y 34 Or make no charge to the particular passenger Norton v Western R R Corporation 15 N Y 444 The service may be limited in any way so long as it is available to all who choose to use it Although the carrier offers to serve all who apply persons are not passengers until their offer to become pas sengers is accepted expressly or impliedly by the carrier Bricker v Phila delphia and Reading Railroad Co 132 Pa St I Warren v Fitchburg Rail road Co 8 Allen Mass 227 It would seem therefore that although the relation of carrier and passenger is not established until acceptance of the passengers offer to employ the status of the carrier as such is created by the offer to carry indiscriminately The proprietors of livery stables letting out cabs with drivers are not common carriers per se Stanley v Steele 77 Conn 688 Payne v Halstead 44 Ill App 97 A corporation is a common carrier or not depending upon the powers exercised rather than the powers con ferred and where it carries passengers and goods between railroad terminals and hotels and also does a garage business with individuals it is a common carrier as to the terminal and hotel business but not as to the garage busi ness Terminal Taxicab Co v District of Columbia 241 U S 252 The principal consequences of the status of common carrier of passengers are I the duty to carry all who apply unless legally excused and 2 to exercise the highest degree of care and foresight possible in the selection and manipu 94

FALSE REPRESENTATIONS ON A SALE OF REAL ESTATE BUT THE QUESTION SEEMS IDENTICAL IN BOTH CASES VIZ WHETHER RELIEF MAY BE HAD IN DAMAGES UNDER SEC 3299 OR WHETHER RESCISSION IS THE ONLY REMEDY THE POINT OF DIFFICULTY IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE IS THAT GROWING OUT OF THE EFFORT OF THE SURETY TO APPEAL WITHOUT THE PRINCIPALS UNITING IN THE APPEAL656 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JAN THE PLEA IN THE NATURE OF A CROSSACTION UNDER SECTION 3299 OF THE CODE SET UP A BREACH OF COVENANT OF TITLE TO LAND BY REASON OF AN OUTSTANDING TITLE TO THE MINERALS THEREUNDER IN ANOTHER FOR WHICH DAMAGES WERE DE MANDED BOTH PRINCIPAL AND SURETY UNITED IN THE PLEA BUT THE LOWER COURT ERRONEOUSLY EXCLUDED IT ON APPEAL BY THE SURETY ALONE THE COURT HOLDS THAT THE SURETY COULD NOT AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE MATTER SET UP IN THE PLEA WITHOUT THE JOINDER OF THE PRINCIPAL IN THE APPEAL THE REASONING OF THE COURT IN THE LATTER PART OF THE OPINION SEEMS CON CLUSIVE IN A CASE LIKE THAT AT BAR IT MAY BE AS THE COURT WELL SAYS A MATTER OF GRAVE IMPORT TO THE VENDEE OF REAL ESTATE WHETHER HE WILL SUE AT ONCE ON THE COVENANT OF TITLE BEFORE EVICTION WHEN HE MAY BE ABLE TO RECOVER NOMINAL DAMAGES ONLY BUT MAY NEVERTHELESS THUS ESTOP HIMSELF FROM A SUBSEQUENT ACTION OR WHETHER HE WILL POSTPONE HIS ACTION UNTIL HE SUFFERS EVICTION AND BECOMES ENTITLED TO SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OF THIS RIGHT OF ELECTION HE SHOULD NOT BE DEPRIVED

EARLIER PART OF THE OPINIONBY WHICH THE SURETY IS DENIED THE RIGHT OF MAKING A DEFENSE IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL DOES NOT JOIN WHERE THE NATURE OF THE DEFENSE IS SUCH THAT A RECOVERY OVER MAY BE HAD AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF BECAUSE IN SUCH CASE THE SURETY MIGHT BY VIRTUE OF SUCH RECOVERY OVER FIND HIMSELF THUS ENRICHED AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS PRIN CIPALIS SATISFACTORY ENOUGH IF CONFINED AS WE

CROSSACTIONS SOME OF THE AUTHORITY CITED HOW EVER WOULD SEEM UNREASONABLY TO RESTRICT THE RIGHT OF THE SURETY UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE PLEA NOT IN THE NATURE OF A CROSSACTION TO CUT DOWN PLAINTIFFS RECOVERY BY SETTING UP A BREACH OF THE CONTRACT WITH THE PRINCIPAL UNLESS THE LATTER UNITES IN THE DEFENSE WHERE FOR EX AMPLE THERE IS A GOOD DEFENSE TO AN ACTION ON A SIMPLE CONTRACT LIKE PART PAYMENT PARTIAL FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION ETC WHICH IF NOT MADE IN THAT PROCEEDING CANNOT AFTERWARDS BE MADE THE GROUND OF AN INDEPENDENT ACTION IN OTHER WORDS THAT WHICH IS STRICTLY MATTER OF DEFENSECERTAINLY THE SURETY SHOULD NOT BY THE REFUSAL OF THE PRINCIPAL TO JOIN HIM IN THE PLEA BE DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE DEFENSE IT IS OF ESPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN VIRGINIA THAT A SURETYS RIGHTS IN THIS RESPECT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY GUARDED IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT UNDER SECTION 3396 OF THE CODE HE MAY PRACTICALLY BE SUED AT LAW WITHOUT HAVING HIS PRINCIPAL MADE A CODEFENDANT UNDER THIS SECTION ALTHOUGH ACTION ON A JOINT CONTRACT MUST BE BROUGHT AGAINST ALL THE JOINT CONTRACTORS IT MAY BE DISCONTINUED AS TO ANY OF THEMAND OF COURSE WE IMAGINE AS TO THE PRINCIPAL AS WE UNDERSTAND THE DECISION IT AMOUNTS TO THIS AND CONFINED TO THIS IT SEEMS ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY NAMELY UNLESS THE PRINCIPAL UNITES A SURETY CANNOT SET UP ANY DEFENSE IN THE NATURE OF A CROSSACTION BASED ON A DIS TINCT CAUSE OF ACTION IN THE PRINCIPAL NOR ANY OTHER DEFENSE WHICH THOUGH IT MERELY SEEK TO REDUCE PLAINTIFFS RECOVERY MIGHT BE MADE THE BASIS OF A1903 ANDERSON V COMMONWEALTH 657

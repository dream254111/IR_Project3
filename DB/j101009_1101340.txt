dies pending the action of the right to have the action revived in their names on motion without notice as provided by sec 3308 of the Code notwith standing the provisions of sec 3303 declaring that the defendant shall be deemed to have brought an action against the plaintiff for the amount of the setoff and that the plaintiff shall not dismiss the action without defendants consent 2 RECOUPMENT UNDER CODE SECTION 3299Breach of covenant for title A grantee of real estate when sued at law by his grantor for the pur chase price may under Code section 3299 file a special plea claiming damages for a breach of warranty or covenant for title by his grantor  Ieported by M P Burks State Reporter648  8 VIRGINIIA LAW REGISTER Jan unless the defence would require the contract to be rescinded and the grantor to be reinvested with the title conveyed 3 SPECIAL PLEA UNDER CODE SECTION 3299Cannot be filed by surety Breach of warranty of titleAppeal and error If in an action by a grantor against the grantee and his surety on a bond given for the purchase price of real estat a joint plea be filed by principal and surety under section 3299 of the Code claiming damages for a breach of warranty of the title and the plea be found against the defendants the surety cannot alone prosecute a writ of error The defence is per sonal to the principal though if successfully made it would redound to the benefit of the surety The surety has no claim for damages against the grantor for a breach of covenant in a deed to which he is no party and under which he acquired no interest 4 DAMAGEsBreach of warrantySetoifsCode sections 3298 and 3299 Damages for breach of warranty could not be claimed at common law by way of a recoupment against a sealed instrument nor can they be claimed by way of setofl under the provisions of section 3298 of the Code as the provisions of that section apply only where the setoff is  debt or liquidated demand Such damages can only be asserted under section 3299 of the Code and in the manner therein prescribed 6 WARRANTY OF RIGHT TO ONVEY LANDWhen brokenEffect of judg ment for nominal damagesSetoif A covenant by a grantor in a deed that he has the right to convey the land is broken if at all as soon as the deed is made and the grantee may sue at once without averring eviction or special damage The judgment however would be for only nominal damages but it would bar any subsequent action on the covenant although the grantee were subsequently evicted The same result would follow if the damages though nominal were set up by way of setoff 6 CoNTiNUANCEDiscretion of trial courtReview A motion for a continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the court under all the circumstances of the case and although an appellate court will review the action of a

wherein the de fendants in error were the plaintiffs and the plaintiff in error and another were the defendants Affirmed The opinion states the case oge  oge and R C Stearnes for the plaintiff in error C M Lunsford for the defendant in error1903 KINZIE V RIELY 649 BucEANriA J delivered the opinion of the court George Riely instituted his action of debt upon a bond for the payment of money executed by Henry Garst Jr John H Garst Jr and Joseph C Kinzie making as defendants thereto the last two named obligors and the personal representative of Henry Garst Jr By leave of the court the action was dismissed as to the personal representative of the deceased obligor The defendants the sur viving obligors filed a general plea of payment and a special plea under section 3299 of the Code to which latter plea the plaintiff filed his demurrer and the cause was continued At the next term of the court the plaintiff having in the mean time departed this life the action was revived upon the motion and in the name of his personal representatives At a subsequent day of the term the defendants moved the court to set aside the order of revival which motion was overruled This action of the court is the first error assigned It is contended that the effect of filing the plea of set off was as to matters contained in the plea to make the original defendants plaintiffs and the original plaintiff a defendant under the provi sions of section 3303 of the Code and that being such defendant at the time of his death the action could not be revived by motion in the name of his personal representatives under the provisions of section 3308 of the Code Whilst section 3303 of the Code provides that a defendant who files a plea or account of set off under chapter 160 of the Code shall be deemed to have brought an action against the plaintiff and that the latter shall not after such plea or account is filed dismiss his case without the defendants consent it does not make the party bringing the action a defendant or the party flling the plea of set off a plaintiff within the meaning of section 3308 of the Code or deprive the personal representatives of the party bringing the action of the right to have it revived in their names by motion The next assignment of error is to the action of the court sus taining the demurrer to the special plea of set off filed by the defendants It was averred in that plea that the bond sued on was executed by John H Garst as principal and by the other obligors therein as sureties for the purchase price of a tract of land sold and con veyed to John H Garst by the plaintiff by a deed in which the650 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Jan grantor covenanted among other things that he had the right to convey the land that the plaintiff had not kept and performed the covenants in his deed in this that he did not have title to or the right to convey but on the contrary the devisees of Dr John H Griffin deceased had at the date of the conveyance and still have the lawful title to an onehalf interest in all the stone coal mines and mineral springs in and upon the land that there are valuable deposits of stone and coal and valuable mines and mineral springs upon the land and that by reason of the premises the said John II Garst had sustained great loss and damage amounting to the sum of 50000 which was still due and owing to the said John H Garst and which he was willing to allow and asked to have set off against the plaintiffs demand One of the objections made to the plea was that it undertook to set up a breach of warranty of title to real estate and that this cannot be done as a set off in a court of law The people of this commonwealth at a very early day showed their disapproval of that rule of the common law which did not allow cross demands to be settled in the same action and as early as 16445 some years it seems before either England or any of her other colonies had enacted any statute upon the subject the legis lature of the colony of Virginia passed an act modifying the com mon law rule and authorizing pleas of set off in certain cases 1 Henning Stat pp 296 314 5 Rob Pr 958 Rawle on Covenants for Title 5th ed sec 324 That statute has been amended from time to time until we now have the very comprehensive provisions contained in chapter 160 of the Code In the case of Watkins v Hopkins 13 Gratt 743 747 some doubt was expressed in the opinion of the court as to whether sec tion 5 chapter 172 of the Code of 1849 extended to a case of breach of warranty of the title to real estate but that section as amended by the Act of March 26 1873 Acts 18723 p 196 and found in section 3299 of the present Code is clearly sufficiently broad to authorize the grantee to file a special plea for breach of warranty or covenant for title in an action brought by the grantor to recover the purchase price of the land conveyed unless the defense set up would require the contract to be rescinded and the grantor to be reinvested with the title conveyed See 4 Minors Inst 3d ed 7956 Sheffey v Gardiner 79 Va 313 Grayson1903 KINZIE V RIELY 651 v Buchanan 88 Va 251 WVatkins v West Wytheville Land Co 92 Va 1 9 Mangus v McClelland 93 Va 786 789 The special plea of set off having been held insufficient on de murrer the case was submitted to the court for decision and a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs From that judgment the defendant Kinzie the surety on the bond obtained this writ of error The principal in the bond is not a party to the writ and is not complaining of the ruling of the court rejecting the special plea Can the surety the plaintiff in error raise the question as to the propriety of the trial courts action in rejecting the special plea of set off The principal by failing or refusing to become a party to the writ of error cannot of course deprive his surety of the right to have the action of the trial court reversed for improperly rejecting any plea which the surety had the right to file but it is equally true we apprehend that a surety cannot complain of the rejection of a plea which his principal alone had the right to file and who had the right to file it or not as he saw proper although the defense set up by it would redound if successfully made to the benefit of the surety Section 3298 of the Code provides that although the plaintiffs claim be jointly against several persons a debt due to only a part of the defendants may be set off against the plaintiffs demand if it appear that the persons against whom such claim is stand in the the relation of principal and surety and the person entitled to the set off is principal The provisions of that section apply only where the set off is a debt or liqzuidated demand 4 Minors Inst 3d ed 787 5 Rob Pr 964 c Webster v Couch 6 Rand 519 Christian v Miller 3 Leigh 78 Harrison v Wortham 8 Leigh 296 The damages claimed in this case could not be relied on as a set off finder that section of the Code because they are unliquidated Neither could they be relied on as a common law counter claim in the nature of recoupment since the plaintiffs demand is under seal Columbia Acc Ass v Rockey 93 Va 678 685 and authorities cited The claim was asserted and could only be asserted under the pro visions of section 3299 of the Code and in the manner prescribed by that section The only party by that section authorized to file the special plea in question is a defendant who is entitled to recover damages at law from the plaintiff or the person under whom the652 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Jan plaintiff claims or to relief in equity against the obligation of the contract sued on This is clear not only from the language of that section but from the provisions of sections 3300 and 3304 especi ally the provisions of the latter section By the first subdivision of that section it is provided that if the plaintiff be a person with whom the contract sued on was originally made or the personal representative of such person in the trial of the case the jury shall ascertain the amount to which the defendant is entitled and apply it as set off against the plaintiffs demand and if the said amount be more than the plaintiff is entitled to shall ascertain the excess and fix the time from which interest is to be computed on the same or any part thereof and judgment in such case shall be for the defendant against the plaintiff for said excess and interest By the second subdivision of the section it is provided that if the plaintiff claim as assignee or transferree under a person with whom the contract sued on was originally made and the defendants claim exceeds the plaintiffs demand the defendant may waive the benefit of his claim to any excess beyond the plaintiffs claim or instead of such waiver it is provided by the third subdivision of the section that the defendant may by rule issued by the court or on his application issued by the clerk in vacation or by reasonable notice in writing such rule or notice substantially stating the de fendants claim make the person under whom the plaintiff claims a party to the suit and on the trial of the case the jury shall ascertain and apply as provided in the first subdivision of the section the amount and interest to which the defendant is entitled and for any excess beyond the plaintiffs demand for which such person under whom the plaintiff claims is liable with such interest as the jury allows judgment shall berendered for the defendant against such person It is manifest that a surety on a bond for the purchase price of land who is no party to the deed by which the land was sold and conveyed has no claim for damages against the grantor in the deed for breach of his covenants for title Having no interest in the damages he cannot set them up against the plaintiffs demand even to the extent of what his principal owes the plaintiff for if he could then by the terms of the statute if the damages due his principal exceed the plaintiffs demand he would be entitled to recover such excess from the plaintiff or the party through whom he claims as is provided by the first and third subdivisions of section1903 KINZIE V RIELY 653 3304 or he could under the second subdivision of the section waive the benefit of his principals claim as to the excess of the plaintiffs demand Even if the statute were ambiguous as it is not the court would not put such a construction upon it as would lead to the absurdity and injustice of enabling a surety to file a special plea by which he could recover judgment upon a claim for damages for which he had no cause of action or on the trial of which he could waive rights in which he had no interest The principal obligor alone had the right to file the special plea which was rejected by the court He was not compelled to avail himself of the privilege conferred by the statute but could bring his independent action upon cross demand 4 Minors Inst 787t 3d ed 5 Rob Pr 960 Having the right to assert his demani for damages by special plea in this case or by an original action he could when his special plea was rejected abide the action of the court or have it reversed upon writ of error The effect of his failure or refusal to unite in the writ of error was to elect not ta set up his claim for damages in this case The principal cannot be deprived of this right of election by the surety or be compelled to ligitate in this cause a claim which he may prefer to assert by an independent action It was said in La Farge v Halsey 1 Boswell N Y 171 where sureties on a lease claimed the benefit of and sought to set off in a suit against them for rent due a claim of the lessee against the lessor for damages if by reason of any fact stated as part of this defence Laura Keene the principal in the lease might have set up a counter claim or recoupment these defendants cannot She assigned no such claim to them and without that they have nG right to use what is in her a distinct cause of action nor to any part of it for their benefit I they are compelled to pay the rent they must seek reimbursement from her and she will have her recourse to the plaintiff for any damages she has sustained Waterman on Setoff says An accomnmodation endorser of the note of a vendee of goods cannot when sued on his endorsement set up damages resulting to the vendee by a breach of warranty of the goods sold unless perhaps in the case of insolvency of the vendee or upon some other equitable ground he be permitted to do so If the vendee set up the claim against the note he might recover the whole damages sustained by him The endorser would have no control of that right of action The vendee might enforce654 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Jan assign or release it He might not choose to permit the endorser to have the benefit of it The endorser could not under any view of the subject make it available to effect more than the extinguish iment of the plaintiffs claim He would not be at liberty to so limit the rights of the vendee and possibly preclude his obtaining full compensation for his damages for the plaintiff could not be re quired to litigate the matter twice These considerations show that an endorser in virtue of his relation to the parties as surety for the maker cannot protect himself by such set off This statement of the law is sustained by the case of Gillespie v Torrance 2r N Y 306 This must be so otherwise the principal would be deprived of his election and be compelled to assert his demand by way of set off when he might prefer and it would best subserve his interest to bring his independent action for its recovery This case is an excellent illustration of the wisdom of the rule which gives the principal the right of election The claim asserted in the rejected plea is for damages resulting from a breach of covenant of the right to convey The breach occurred if at all according to the weight of American authority as soon as the deed was made and the grantee could at once bring his action without averring eviction or special damage Rawle on Covenants for Title secs 59 and 62 2 Lomax Dig side page 266 Dickenson v Hoomes Admr 8 Gratt 397 Judge Moncures opinion Leroy v Beard 8 How U S 451 465 If there had been no eviction and no special damage had resulted from the breach of the covenant when the plea of set off was filed only nominal damages could be allowed and yet it is well settled that a recovery of nominal damages for the breach of covenant of seisin or of the right to convey can be pleaded in bar of any subsequent action on that covenantRawle on Covenants of Title sec 178although he may afterwards be evicted of the land which his grantor had no right to convey If his claim for damages was set up by way of set off a recovery of nominal dam ages would equally bar any future action for the breach By filing the plea of set off he is deemed to have brought a separate action upon the covenant and he cannot again present a demand for its breach luff v Broyles 26 Gratt 285 2889 4 Minors Inst 798 It is a matter of consequence therefore to the grantee that he shall not be deprived of his right to assert his claim for damages at such1903 KINZIE V RIELY 655 time as will best protect him from loss by reason of the breach of the covenant We are of opinion therefore that the plaintiff in error the surety upon the bond sued on ought not to be permitted to question the action of the trial court in rejecting the plea of set off of which the principal is not complaining The refusal of the court to grant a continuance upon the defend ants motion is assigned as error A motion for a continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the court under all the circumstances of the case and although an appellate court will review the action of the trial court it will not reverse its judgment upon such motion unless plainly erroneous Payne v Zell 98 Va 294 The case had been continued at a former term of the court for the defendant Upon the plea of payment which was the only plea in the case when the motion to continue was made it was conceded that the defendants had no evidence to introduce No sufficient ground indeed no legal ground at all was shown why the case should be continued in order that the defendants might have further time in which to file additional pleas The courts refusal to continue instead of being plainly erroneous was manifestly right We are of opinion that there is no error in the action of the Circuit Court of which the plaintiff in error can complain and that its judment must be affirmed Affirmed NOTEThe court in this case holds that a breach of covenant of title to real estate may be set up under section 3299 of the Code in an action at law for the purchase money where the plea does not demand rescission but merely damages In a former case Soouth Roanoke L Go v Roberts some doubt was cast on the proposition that damages might be recovered under sec 3299 for breach of an executory contract to convey real estate and this was made the text of an editorial criticism in 7 Va Law Reg 250 The court had however already virtually held the affirmative of the proposition in a case which escaped the editors attention but which is cited in the foregoing opinion Watkins v West Wytheville etc Co 92 Va 1 This case in volved damages for false representations on a sale of real estate but the question seems identical in both cases viz whether relief may be had in damages under sec 3299 or whether rescission is the only remedy The point of difficulty in the principal case is that growing out of the effort of the surety to appeal without the principals uniting in the appeal656 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Jan The plea in the nature of a crossaction under section 3299 of the Code set up a breach of covenant of title to land by reason of an outstanding title to the minerals thereunder in another for which damages were de manded Both principal and surety united in the plea but the lower court erroneously excluded it On appeal by the surety alone the court holds that the surety could not avail himself of the matter set up in the plea without the joinder of the principal in the appeal The reasoning of the court in the latter part of the opinion seems con clusive in a case like that at bar It may be as the court well says a matter of grave import to the vendee of real estate whether he will sue at once on the covenant of title before eviction when he may be able to recover nominal damages only but may nevertheless thus estop himself from a subsequent action or whether he will postpone his action until he suffers eviction and becomes entitled to substantial damages Of this right of election he should not be deprived by any act of the surety And his failure to prosecute the appeal is tantamount to an election to abide by the ruling of the lower court and to keep his right of action in reserve The reasoning in the earlier part of the opinionby which the surety is denied the right of making a defense in which the principal does not join where the nature of the defense is such that a recovery over may be had against the plaintiff because in such case the surety might by virtue of such recovery over find himself thus enriched at the expense of his prin cipalis satisfactory enough if confined as we understand the court means to confine it to defenses of this characterthat is to liquidated setoffs inder section 3298 and unliquidated damages under section 3299in short to defenses in the nature of crossactions Some of the authority cited how ever would seem unreasonably to restrict the right of the surety under the general issue or other appropriate plea not in the nature of a crossaction to cut down plaintiffs recovery by setting up a breach of the contract with the principal unless the latter unites in the defense Where for ex ample there is a good defense to an action on a simple contract like part payment partial failure of consideration etc which if not made in that proceeding cannot afterwards be made the ground of an independent action in other words that which is strictly matter of defensecertainly the surety should not by the refusal of the principal to join him in the plea be deprived of the right to make the defense It is of especial importance in Virginia that a suretys rights in this respect should be carefully guarded in view of the fact that under section 3396 of the Code he may practically be sued at law without having his principal made a codefendant Under this section although action on a joint contract must be brought against all the joint contractors it may be discontinued as to any of themand of course we imagine as to the principal As we understand the decision it amounts to this and confined to this it seems entirely satisfactory namely Unless the principal unites a surety cannot set up any defense in the nature of a crossaction based on a dis tinct cause of action in the principal nor any other defense which though it merely seek to reduce plaintiffs recovery might be made the basis of a1903 ANDERSON V COMMONWEALTH 657 subsequent independent action by the principalbecause in either of these cases it is properly the sole prerogative of the principal to elect how and when he will enforce a cause of action belonging solely to himself and for the additional reason in the first case of the anomaly of the suretys re covering over against the plaintiff on a cause of action not his own

the plaintiff against the city of New Haven to recover damages for personal injuries received from a fall upon ice on a sidewalk which was covered with snow which had recently fallen The city had no notice of the condition of the sidewalk Held the city is not liable Carl v City of New Haven Conn 107 Atl 502 The question of the liability of municipal corporations for injuries due to ice and snow on streets or sidewalks has been frequently be fore the courts but it cannot be said that the courts have adopted any settled doctrine upon the subject It may be said however that as a general rule a municipal corporation is charged with the duty of ex ercising ordinary care and vigilance in keeping sidewalks in a safe condition Furnell v City of St Paul 20 Gil Minn 101 Manchester v City of Hartford 30 Conn 118 City of Bloomington v Bay 42 Ill 503 A city is held liable where it negligently permits an accumulation of smooth ice on its thoroughfares to the same extent as if the ice had formed in ridges or mounds Mogaha v City of Hageirstown 95 Md 62 51 Atl 832 93 Am St Rep 317 But the mere fact that a street of no unusual shape or construction is slippery by reason of a smooth coating of ice from general or local causes does not constitute a defect or want of repair for which a city is liable Stanton v City of Spring field 94 Mass 566 Billings v City of Worcester 102 Mass 329 3 Am Rep 460 Vonkey v City of St Louis 219 Mo 37 117 S W 733 In order that the plaintiff may recover he must show negligence on the part of the city There must be carelessness in allowing the snow and ice to remain for an un reasonabe length of time to the danger of travelers Todd v City of Troy 61 N Y 506 Toley v City of Troy 45 Hun N Y 396 If there is no lack of care and if there is no breach of the duty on the part of the city to keep the streets in a reasonably safe condition then the city cannot be said to have been negligent and consequently cannot be held liable There must be some neglect of duty Winne v City of Albany 15 N Y Supp 423 City of Chicago v McGiven 78 Ill 347 While a city must exercise ordinary care in keeping its streets and sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition it does not warrant that they will be safe The citys legal obligation is to keep the streets and side walks in such condition that it will be safe for travelers exercising or dinary care See Michigan City v Boeckling 122 Ind 39 23 N E 518 A city is not an insurer in regard to the safety of pedestrians and is not required to take unreasonable or impracticable precautions Chase v City of Cleveland 44 Ohio St 505 58 Am Rep 843 Where the side walks have been cleared by the city and a subsequent fall of rain or the melting of adjoining snow is followed by severe cold weather thus making the sidewalks slippery and dangerous the city does not have to remove the ice until a thaw comes for until that time such removal is practically impossible See Taylor v City of Yonkers 105 N Y 202 11 N E 642 59 Am Rep 492 So also where the plaintiff fell on a piece of ice covered with snow there being no evidence that the street was in need of repair or that the city was otherwise negligent it was held that the city was not liable Tracey v City of Poughkeepsie 46 Hun N Y 569 221222 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Whether cities are liable for not removing ice from sidewalks de pends upon the circumstances of each particular case Nothing can be required of them which a jury would say was unreasonable Hall v City of Lowell 10 Cush Mass 260 Smith v City of Brooklyn 36 Hjun N Y 224 The duty of the city to exercise ordinary care is not dis cretionary but is absolute and obligatory Collins v City of Council Bluffs 32 Iowa 324 7 Am Rep 200 Where injuries are sustained and the plaintiff does not show more than the mere existence of ice which is not dangerous or unsafe except that the sidewalk was at that place very smooth and very difficult to pass over it has been held that the city is not liable Gilbert v City of Roxbury 100 Mass 185 But where the injury was caused by the accumulation of ice and snow in ridges or drifts the city has been held liable Luther v City of Worcester 97 Mass 268 In all cases the city must have a reasonable time in which to remove these obstructions Taylor v City of Yonkers supra In Virginia the general trend of authority is followed and it is held that it is the duty of municipal corporations to use proper and ordi nary care to see that the sidewalks are reasonably safe for persons using ordinary care and prudence But the mere slipperiness of a side walk occasioned by ice and snow which has not been accumulated so as to constitute an obstruction does not render the municipal corpo ration liable City of Lynchburg v Wallace 95 Va 640 29 S E 675 City of Charlottesville v Failes 103 Va 53 48 S E 511 REAL PROPERTYCONDITIONS RESTRAINING ALIENATIONThe plaintiff conveyed land in fee to a certain party upon condition that it should revert to the grantor

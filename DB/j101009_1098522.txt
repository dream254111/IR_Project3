j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098522,Hirth v Hirth Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond February 15 1900,i245869,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER HIRTH V HIRTH Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond February 15 1900 1 MARRIED WOMENContractsSeparate estatePleading A married woman is now as at common law incapable of making a contract unless she owns some separate estate at the time the contract is made and a declaration which fails to aver such ownership is bad on demurrer Error to a judgment of the Law and Equity Court of the city of Richmond rendered April 12 1899 in an action of assumpsit wherein the defendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintiff in error was the defendant Reversed The opinion states the case Leake  Carter and Wm H Sands for the plaintiff in error Christian  Christian and Davis  Davis for the defendant in error HARRISON J delivered the opinion of the court The plaintiff in error insists that the court below erred in overruling her demurrer The declaration shows on its face that the promise sued on was made by a married woman during coverture to assume the debt of her hus band The ground of the demurrer is that the declaration does not aver that the plaintiff in error owned separate estate at the time the promise sued on was entered into The contention being that such an allegation is essential because she had no power to make the alleged contract unless she did own separate estate At common law a mar ried woman had no power to contract her engagements were simply void This common law disability remains in full force in this State except so far as modified by statute The only power a married wo man has to contract is conferred by sec 2288 of the Code which is in these words  She may make contracts as if sole in respect to such trade business labor services and her said separate estate or upon the faith and credit thereof and upon such contracts and as to all matters connected with relating to or affecting such trade business labor ser vices or separate estate and upon contracts and liabilities made or in curred before her marriage she may sue and be sued in the same man  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter March 774ner and there shall be the same remedies in respect thereof for and against her and her said estate as if she were unmarried This act does not confer upon a married woman power to contract generally It limits such power to married women who have separate estate Chapter 103 of the Code relating to the separate estate of married women was the result of serious consideration and much labor on the part of its authors and as said by another If the object of the revisors had been to emancipate all married women from the disabilities of coverture there would have been no need of chapter 103 of the Code but it might have been accomplished in a few brief sentences in one section See note to Dezendorf v Humphreys 3 Va Law Reg p 797 We hold therefore that a married woman is now as at common law incapable of making a contract unless she owns separate estate at the time the contract is made The ownership of separate estate by a married woman being a pre requisite to the exercise by her of any contractual power it follows that in order to maintain an action at law upon a contract made by her during coverture it is necessary for the declaration or other plead ing filed in the cause to aver that she not only made tht promise sued on but to aver also such a state of facts as will show that her promise is such as under the statute she was authorized to make Duval v Chelf 92 Va 489 The questions raised on the merits may be different on another trial and therefore should not be considered now For these reasons we are of opinion that the demurrer to the declara tion should have been sustained At order will therefore be entered reversing the judgment setting aside the verdict sustaining the de murrer and remanding the cause for a new trial with leave to the defendant in error to amend her declaration NOTEIn view of the numerous discussions thathave heretofore appeared in the REGISTER the decision in the principal case has been awaited with interest by the profession The question is now set at rest and the law of Virginia is that a married woman must have  some separate estate before she is competent to make contracts We refer our readers to the opinion for the reasons which have led the court to this conclusion We had thought the question a difficult one until the court elucidated it in a single sentence The REGISTER has been an earnest advocate of a contrary view but gracefully accepts the inevitable howsoever opposed to its own convictions One question yet remains which the court will doubtless find equally simple and that is How much separate property must the wife possess in order to qualify her to make contracts  1900 775 HIRTH V HIRTH

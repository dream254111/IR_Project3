quench my light they darkly do conceal My welfare and my rest O Lord my God all strength doth dwell in thee O hear my voice as humbly here I bow And let the sentence of thy judgment be Take thou my blessing nowl Behold me fallen low from whence I stood And mine assembly with compassion see And this my soul mine only one tis good To give it unto thee Take back thy son once more and draw him near Hide not from him the radiance of thine eye Turn not away but lend a favouring ear Unto my plaint my cry2 NINA DAVIS THE ARK OF THE COVENANT Suggested by the annexed fragments from the Talmud There is a legend full of joy and pain An old tradition told of former years When Israel built the temple once again And stayed his tears Twas in the chamber where the Wood Pile lay The logs wherewith the altars flame was fed There hope recalled the Light of vanished day The Light long fled A priest moved slowly oer the marble floor Sorting the fuel in the chamber stored Frail was his form he ministered no more Before the Lord 82 Oen xxxiii II 2 Lam iii 56SOME TRANSLATIONS OF HEBREW POEMS Wrapt in deep thought with sad and mournful mien Plying his axe with oft a troubled sigh Dreaming of glory that the House had seen In days gone by Mused of the time when in the Holy Place Gods Presence dwelt betwixt the Cherubim And of the day he turned away his face And light grew dim When the Shechinah from that erring throng Alas withdrew yet tarried in the track As one who lingreth on the threshold long And looketh back Then step by step in that reluctant flight Approached the shadow of the city wall And lingered yet upon the mountain height For hoped recall The Temple standeth pride of Israels race Yet resteth there no sacred Ark of Gold Gods Glory filleth not the Holy Place Ah loss untold Surely the glory of the House is oer Gone is the Presence silent is the Voice They who remember that which is no more Can they rejoice  Convulsed a sacred spasm seized his frame The axe fell from his trembling hands control A fire leapt upward and the burning flame Consumed his soul His eyes were fixed upon the ground he gazed Upon a stone of that smooth marble plain Which seemed as from its place it had been raised And set again Into his heart there flashed prophetic light With sudden force the secret was revealed 83THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Nought but one treasure sacred in his sight Lay there concealed As one of Heaven bid who dare not wait With step grown firm as with the strength of youth He hastened to his comrade to relate The wondrous truth His hand uplifted and a light sublime Shot from his eyes and like a joybeam shone He seemed a holy seer of olden time To look upon Yet from his parted lips no message came In silence reached he his immortal goal And from its dwelling in the earthly frame Went forth his soul Soon oer the house flew sad and strange reports And men and women bristled at the sound And priests came swiftly from the sacred courts And thronged around Piercing the crowd a woman made her way Seeming to own a right which none gainsaid And neared the spot where that calm figure lay The priestly dead And reverent to the prostrate form she passed Pressing her lips upon the peaceful brow She whispered Thy desire hath come at last Tis granted now Then spake the High Priest Wherefore dost thou thus  Is the dead thine that thou hast spoken so And knowest thou the secret hid from us Which dealt the blow O priest it is according to thy word She answered And I know that secret well He as he breathed his last the message heard And that did tell 84SOME TRANSLATIONS OF HEBREW POEMS Woman thy tongue is false thy word untrue Yon priest divulged nought with his dying breath Nor uttered sound ere to his heart there flew The shaft of death My lord thy servant lieth not she said His soul departing did to mine unfold A glorious light and as his spirit fled The tale was told Oft have I stood in prayer in yonder court And marked that weak wan figure worn with care Transformed by heavenly light and sacred thought To beauty rare On ye O priests his longing eyes were bent While at the altar ye your charge have kept And oft a sigh so deep the silence rent In prayer I wept And I have read this day his lifes fair dream And in his death have seen that dream fulfilled The longing of his heart the wish supreme That faith instilled Say ye Gods Ark is captive far away And weep ye Ichabod the glory fled And mourn ye that the brightness of the day Is quenched and dead Maybe t is true that in a faroff land The Ark of God in exile dwelleth still It resteth ever with the pure of hand Who do his will Know then ye priests and Levites Israel all Hid in its place the Ark of God doth lie His Presence hath not gone beyond recall But bideth nigh Behold Thou conest as the dawn of day Shechinah changeless to illume the nightTIIE JEWISII QUARTERLY REVIEW O thou who art a lamp upon the way Who art a light Haste brethren let the gates asunder burst Regain the Ark the Covenant hold fast And by the glorious Second House the First Shall be surpassed She ceased and silence cast its shackles oer The awestruck crowd her shadowy form moved on With Godlit eyes she stood a moment more And then was gone So was that death with lifes quintessence crownd The truth illumined each inquiring face For all knew then Gods Ark would yet be found Within its place NINA DAVIS Rabbi Eliezer saith The Ark hath gone into captivity unto Babylon as it is said And at the return of the year King Nebuchad nezzar sent and brought him to Babylon with the goodly

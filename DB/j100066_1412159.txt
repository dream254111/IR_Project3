some few have a claim to be considered absolute such as mathematical implications and mechanical laws But the vast majority are only partial medicine does not teach that smallpox is inevitably escaped by vaccination but that it is so generally biology has not shown that all animals require organic food but that nearly all do so in daily life a dark sky is no proof that it will rain but merely a warning even in morality the sole categorical imperative alleged by Kant was the sinfulness of telling a lie and few thinkers since have admitted so much as this to be valid uni versally In psychology more perhaps than in any other science it is hard to find absolutely inflexible coincidences occasionally indeed there appear uniformities sufficiently reg ular to be practically treated as laws but infinitely the greater part of the observations hitherto recorded concern only more or less pronounced tendencies of one event or aftribute to accom pany another Under these circumstances one might well have expected that the evidential evaluation and precise mensuration of tend encies had long been the subject of exhaustive investigationMEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATION and now formed one of the earliest sections in a beginners psy chological course Instead we find only a general naive igno rance that there is anything about it requiring to be learnt One after another laborious series of experiments are executed and published with the purpose of demonstrating some connection be tween two events wherein the otherwise learned psychologist reveals that his art of proving and measuring correspondence has not advanced beyond that of lay persons The conse quence has been that the significance of the experiments is not at all rightly understood nor have any definite facts been elicited that may be either confirmed or refuted The present article is a commencement at attempting to remedy this deficiency of scientific correlation With this view it will be strictly confined to the needs of practical workers and all theoretical mathematical demonstrations will be omitted it may however be said that the relations stated have already received a large amount of empirical verification Great thanks are due from me to Professor Haussdorff and to Dr G Lipps each of whom have supplied a useful theorem in polynomial probability the former has also very kindly given valuable advice concerning the proof of the important formulae for elimi nation of  systematic deviations At the same time and for the same reason the meaning and working of the various formulae have been explained suffi ciently it is hoped to render them readily usable even by those whose knowledge of mathematics is elementary The fundamental procedure is accompanied by simple imaginary examples while the more advanced parts are illustrated by cases that have actually occurred in my personal experience For more abundant and positive exemplification the reader is requested to refer to the under cited research which is entirely built upon the principles and mathematical relations here laid down In conclusion the general value of the methodics recom mended is emphasized by a brief criticism of the best correla tional work hitherto made public and also the important ques tion is discussed as to the number of  cases  required for an experimental series PART I ELEMENTARY CORRELATION AND ACCIDENTAL DEVIATION I Requirements of a Good Method of Correlation a Quantitative expression The most fundamental requisite is to be able to measure our observed correspondence by a plain numerical symbol There 1General Intelligence determined and measured to appear in a subsequent number of this Journal 73is no reason whatever to be satisfied either with vague general ities such as large medium small or on the other hand with complicated tables and compilations The first person to see the possibility of this immense ad vance seems to have been Galton who in I886 writes the length of the arm is said to be correlated with that of the leg because a person with a long arm has usually a long leg and conversely 1 He then proceeds to devise the required symbol in such a way that it conveniently ranges from i for perfect correspondence to o for entire independence and on again to I for perfect correspondence inversely By this means cor relations became comparable with other ones found either in different objects or by different observers they were at last capable of leading to further conclusions speculative and prac tical in a word they now assumed a scientific character Mathematically it is clear that innumerable other systems of values are equally conceivable similarly ranging from I to o One such for instance has been worked out and extensively used by myself see pp 86 ff It therefore becomes necessary to discuss their relative merits b The significance of the quantity Galtons particular system is defined and most advantageously distinguished from all the others by the important property that if any number of arms for instance be collected which are all any amount XOra above mean then the corresponding legs will average rxrl above the mean with a middle or quartile deviation 2 of orl vxr2 where ra  the quartile variation of the arms r  that of the legs and r is the meas ure of the correlation But anothertheoretically far more valuableproperty may conceivably attach to one among the possible systems of values expressing the correlation this is that a measure might be afforded of the hidden underlying cause of the variations Sup pose for example that A and B both derive their money from variable dividends and each gets ixth of his total from some source common to both of them Then evidently their respec tive incomes will have a certain tendency to rise and fall simul taneously this correspondence will in any of the possible sys tems of values always be some function ix but in only one of them will it actually be itself  ix in such a favored case it A and B get say 20 of their respective incomes from the common source the correlation between these two incomes will also show itself as 020 and conversely if As income happens to be found correlated with that of B by 020 then Proceedings Royal Society of London Vols XL and XLV 2Commonly but misleadingly termed the probable error 74 SPEARMAN MEASUREMENT OP ASSOCIATION there is a likelihood that 020 of As income coincides with 020 of B leaving to either o 80 disposable independently The ob served correlation thus becomes the direct expression of the rel ative amount of underlying influences tending for and against the correspondence In the above imagined instance this desirable expressiveness belongs to the same above system of values proposed by Gal ton and elaborated by Pearson But this instance is excep tional and fundamentally different from the normal type Evi dently A and B need not necessarily derive exactly the same proportion of their incomes from the common source A might get his 020 while B got some totally different share in which case it will be found that the correlation is always the geomet rical mean between the two shares Let B be induced to put all his income into the common fund then A need only put in o202  004 to maintain the same correlation as before since the geometrical mean between o04 and i is equal to o 20 Now in psychological as in most other actual correspond ences A and B are not to be regarded as in the fixed bisection of our first case but rather as in the labile interaccommoda tion of our second case Hence A in order to be correlated with B by ix must be considered to have only devoted Ix2 instead of Ix of his arrangement to this purpose and there fore to still have for further arrangements i  Ix2 which will enable an independent correlation to arise of VI  Ix2 In short not Galtons measure of correlation but the square thereof indicates the relative influence of the factors in A tending towards any observed correspondence as compared with the remaining components of A tending in other directions c Accuracy From this plurality of possible systems of values for the measure of the correlation must be carefully distinguished the variety of ways of calculating any one of them These latter again have various advantages and disadvantages of which the principal is their respective degrees of liability to acci dental deviation For though the correlation between two series of data is an absolute mathematical fact yet its whole real value lies in our being able to assume a likelihood of further cases taking a simi lar direction we want to consider our results as a truly repre sentative sample Any one at all accustomed to original inves tigation must be aware how frequently phenomena will group themselves in such a manner as to convincingly suggest the existence of some lawwhen still more prolonged experiment reveals that the observed uniformity was due to pure hazard and has no tendency whatever to further repeat itself Luckily this one great source of fallacy can be adequately 75SPEARMAN eliminated owing to the fact that such accidental deviations are different in every individual case hence are often called the variable errors and occur quite impartially in every direction according to the known laws of probability The consequence is that they eventually more or less completely compensate one another and thus finally present an approxi mately true result Such elimination however must always remain theoretically incomplete since no amount of chance coincidence is absolutely impossible but beyond certain limits it becomes so extremely unlikely that for practical purposes we can afford to neglect it When a person loses 14 times run ning at pitchandtoss he can reckon that such a series would not occur by mere accident once in 9999 times and conse quently he will feel justified in attributing the coincidence to some constant disturbing influence Similarly to estimate the evidential value of any other observed uniformity we only re quire to know how nearly the odds against chance coincidence have approached to some such standard maximum as 9999 to I But as any standard must always be more or less arbitrary some thinking it too lenient and others unnecessarily severe it is usual to employ a formula giving not the maximum but the middle deviation or probable error We may then easily find the probability of mere hazard from the following compara tive table If the observed correlation divided by the probable error be  I 2 3 4 5 6 then the frequency of occur ence by mere hazard  1 1 1 1 w r1 Now the smallness of this probable error depends principally upon the number of cases observed but also largely upon the mathematical method of correlation Though a faultiness in the latter respect can theoretically be made good by increasing the range of the observations yet such increase is not always possible and besides has other grave disadvantages which will be discussed later on Other things being equal therefore the best method is that one which gives the least probable error For the benefit of the reader this probable error should always be plainly stated nothing more is required than a rough ap proximation for while it is highly important to distinguish between a deduction worth say 09999 of perfect certainty and one worth only o75 it would be a mere splitting of straws to care whether a particular experiment works out to a validity of o84 or to one of o85 d Ease of application lIn the proper use of this expression 76MBASUREMBNT OF ASSOCIATION The most accurate ways of calculation are generally some what difficult and slow to apply often too there occur cir cumstances under which they cannot be used at all Hence in addition to a standard method which must be used for finally establishing the principal results there is urgent need also of auxiliary methods capable of being employed under the most varied conditions and with the utmost facility But here a word of warning appears not out of place For such auxiliary methods are very numerous and their results owing to accidents will diverge to some extent from one another so that the unwary selfsuggested experimenter may often be led unconsciouslybut none the less unfairlyto pick out the one most favorable for his particular point and thereby confer upon his work an unequivocality to which it is by no means entitled Any departures from the recognized standard methods are only legitimate either when absolutely necessary or for mere preliminary work or for indicating com paratively unimportant relations 2 Standard Methods Explained a Correlations between variables that can be measured quantitatively This may be regarded as the normal type of correlation Its standard method of calculation is that discovered by Bravais1 in I846 and shown by Pearson in I8962 to be the best possible Pearson terms this method that of product moments The formula appears most conveniently expressed as follows S xy r VSx2Sy2 where x and y are the deviations of any pair of characteristics from their respective medians xy is the product of the above two values for any single in dividual Sxy is the sum of such products for all the individuals Sx2 is the sum of the squares of all the various values of x Sy2 is similarly for y and r is the required correlation A simple example may make this method clearer Suppose that it was desired to correlate acuteness of sight with that of hearing and that for this purpose five persons were tested as to the greatest distance at which they could read and hear a stand ard alphabet and sound respectively Suppose the results to be 1 Memoires par divers savants T IX Paris pp 255332 2Phil Trans R S London Vol CLXXXVII

been determined by Pearson as being with sufficient accuracy when a fairly large number of cases have been taken I r 0o674506 Vn ir2 For discussion of correlation between characteristics whose distribution differs considerably from the normal probability curve as regards either range or skewness reference may be made to the works below It may be remarked that the method of product moments is valid whether or not the distribution follow the normal law of frequency so long as the  regression is linear b Correlation between characteristics that can not be meas ured quantitatively In the example quoted by Galton of correspondence between the length of arm and that of leg it may be noted that the cor respondence is proportional quantitatively a long arm has a tendency to be accompanied by a leg not only long but long to the same degree Now in many cases such proportionality is by the nature of things excluded a printed word is possibly remembered better than one heard but nevertheless we cannot in accordance with the preceding formula ascertain whether degrees of visuality are correlated to retentiveness of memory seeing that in the former case there do not exist any degrees a word being simply either seen or not seen Perhaps even Udny Yule Proc R S London Vol LX p 477 Pearson Phil Trans R S London Vol CLXXXV I A p 71 Vol CLXXXVI I A p 343 and Vol CXCI A p 229 G Lipps  Die Theorie der Collectivgegenstdnde Wundts Phil Stud Vol XVIIMEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATION more numerous are those cases where proportionality does in deed exist but practically will not admit of being measured for instance it is probable that conscientiousness is to some extent a hereditary quality yet we cannot well directly deter mine whether brothers tend to possess precisely the same amount of it owing to the fact that we cannot exactly measure it In all such cases we must confine ourselves to counting the frequencies of coexistence We can easily find out how often seen and spoken words are respectively remembered and for gotten It has proved quite feasible to divide the children of a school generally into conscientious and nonconscientious and then to measure how much brothers tend to be in the same division when we have proved this simple association we may provisionally assume correlation of quantity also that is to say if the conscientious generally speaking have a par ticular degree of tendency to possess brothers likewise con scientious then boys with excessively tender scruples will have the same degree of tendency to possess brothers with sim ilarly excessive tenderness while those with only a moderate amount of virtue will be thus correlated with brothers also of only moderate virtue further the ethical resemblance may be expected to repeat itself in cousins etc only reduced in propor tion as the kinship is diminished For measurement of this nonproportional association a standard method which may be termed that of cross mul tiples has been elaborated by Sheppard1 BramleyMoore Filon Lee and Pearson The formula is unfortunately too long and complicated to be usefully quoted in this place It will be found in the under cited worka together with its prob able error as determined by Pearson8 In practice it will generally have to be replaced by one of the more convenient methods to be next described 3 Comparison by Rank This method of cross multiples is not only difficult and tedious of application but also it gives a probable error nearly double that of  product moments Now it can often be altogether escaped in the case of quan tities not admitting absolute measurement by substituting in stead comparison This other way will be discussed at some length as it has been largely used by myself and is believed chiefly responsible for some successful experiments All charac teristics may be collated from two quite distinct aspects either as in example of visual and auditory acuteness by actual IPhil Trans Vol CXCII A p I4I 2 Phil Trans Vol CXCV A pp 27  Phil Trans Vol CXCV A IOI4 79SPEARMAN mensuration or else by order of merit we might say that a student A obtained 8000 marks in an examination while B only got 6000 or instead we might say that A was third out of o00 candidates while B was only 2oth Precisely the same method of calculation may be again used in the latter case simply substituting the inverse ranks 97 8o etc for the per formances 8000 6000 etc a Disadvantages of the Rank method In the first place it may be objected that the observed cor relation would then only hold good for persons of the same average difference from one another For assuming say acute sight to be correlated with acute hearing then the order of merit of A B and C as regards sight is more likely to remain unaltered as regards hearing also when the difference in their respective powers of vision is extremely marked than when they are practically equal on the latter head But the more numerous the persons experimented on the less will be the average difference of faculty it might therefore be supposed that the correlation would become continually less perfect as the experiments were made more extensive This however would be a fallacy ioo experimental subjects compared to gether by Rank would on the whole actually show appre ciably the same average correlation as Iooo provided that in either case the subjects are selected by chance the amount of the correlation is not really dependent upon the difference be tween the grades but upon the relation of this difference to the mean deviation and both of these increase together with the number of subjects On the other hand the correlation will undoubtedly diminish if the subjects be all chosen from a more homogeneous class in a select training school for teachers for example general intelligence will throughout show smaller correlation with other qualities than would be the case in a college for quite average young men of the same age but this fact applies just as much to comparison by Measurement The next possible objection is that comparison by rank bases itself upon an assumption that all the subjects differ from one another by the same amount whereas A may differ from B five times as much as B differs from C But such an assump tion would only take place if correspondence by rank were considered to be wholly equivalent to that by measurement no such assumption is made the two aspects are recognized to be theoretically distinct but advantage is taken of the fact that they give correlational values sensibly equivalent in amount Even against the small existing discrepancy may be set off a deviation of the same order of magnitude which is incurred when using measurement itself owing to the practical necessity of throwing the cases into a number of groups 80MEASUREMUNT OF ASSOCIATION The third and only solid objection is that rank affords a theoretically somewhat less full criterion of correspondence than does measurement and the force even of this argument disap pears on considering that the two methods give appreciably the same correlational values b Advantages of the Rank method The chief of these is the large reduction of the accidental error In a normal frequency curve the outlying exceptional cases are much more spaced apart than are those nearer to the average hence any accident disturbing the position of these exceptional cases will have unduly great effect on the general result of the correlation and owing to this inequality in the influence of the errors the latter will not compensate one another with the same readiness as usual Moreover it is just these hyperinfluential extreme cases where there is most like lihood of accidental errors and where there very frequently prevails a law quite different from that governing the great bulk of the cases As regards the quantity of this gain by using rank abstracting from the last mentioned point which cannot well be estimated in any general manner there should be no difficulty in calculating it mathematically From a con siderable amount of empirical evidence the probable error when using the method of product moments with rank appears to become less than twothirds of that given by the same method with measurement and therefore only about onethird of that given by the method of cross multiples The next advantage is that rank eliminates any disparity between the two characteristics compared as regards their general system of distribution such a disparity is often not in trinsic or in any way relevant but merely an effect of the par ticular manner of gaining the measurement By means of rank a series presenting the normal frequency curve can be compared on even terms with another series whose curve is entirely different This cannot well be done when using measurement See p 78 Rank has also the useful property of allowing any two series to be easily and fairly combined into a third composite one c Conclusion From the practical point of view it is so urgently desirable to obtain the smallest probable error with a given number of subjects that the method of rank must often have the prefer ence even when we are dealing with two series of measure ments properly comparable with one another Theoretically rank is at any rate preferable to such a hybrid and unmeaning correlation as that between essential measure ments on the one side and mere arbitrary classification on the other As the latter occur in most psychological correlations JOURNAL6 8ISPEARMAN the only other resource would be to avoid measurements alto gether by using the method of cross multiples But this trebles the size of the probable error and therefore renders it necessary that the subjects should be no less than nine times as numerous such an enormous increase even if possible would generally be accompanied by disadvantages infinitely outweigh ing the supposed theoretical superiority of method The above advantages are still further enhanced whenever dealing with onesided frequency curves such as are furnished by most mental tests For in these cases the great bulk of influence upon the resulting correlation is derived exclusively from the very worst performances and is consequently of a specially doubtful validity In short correlation by rank in most cases a desirable pro cedure is for short series quite indispensable rendering them of equal evidential value to much longer ones treated by other ways Luckily it is precisely in short series that gradation by rank is practically attainable 4 Auxiliary Methods These as has been said are only for use when there is ade quate reason for not employing the above standard methods Any number are devisable Their resulting correlational values do not quite coincide with those found by the standard ways but nearly enough so for most practical purposes a Auxiliary methods of Pearson Several very ingenious and convenient ones are furnished by him but all of similar type and requiring the same data as that of crossmultiples2 They are therefore for use when the compared events do not admit of direct quantitative corre lation The following appears to combine facility and precision to the greatest degree T Vbc r  sin 2 Va where the two compared series of characteristics say P and Q are each divided into two preferably about equal classes if the case is one where

under sufficiently similar conditions by other experimenters should result in a concordant correlation probably between o I4 and o i8 and certainly be tween o04 and 028 Moreover we have obtained a direct estimate of the impor tance of this apparent superiority of the visual sense for the square of the correlation amounts to 0025 so that of the vari ous causes here tending to make the children remember some words better than others the difference of sense impressed comes to about one fortieth part see p 75 More accurately sin oI686 r I  r2    I I a b c d 83b Method of proportional changes

Suppose for example we were demonstrating that intellect ual fatigue may be satisfactorily investigated by the method of Griessbach2 With this view we have applied his test to Ioo boys before and after their lessons In the latter case 68 of them have presented the expected duller sensitivity but 32 on the contrary have shown a finer discrimination than before work Now clearly had the correspondence been perfect all the hundred would have become worse8 Thus 3 68  32 r 68 2 054 2 I00 As the probable error comes to o I i our imaginary correla tion is five times greater and therefore would not have occurred by mere accident more than once in I250 times so that we become practically certain that the sensitivity of the skin really does measure fatigue It now becomes easy to compare the quantity of this fatigue at different stages of work Let us say that further experi ments after lessons lasting one hour longer than before showed the correlation had risen to 077 Thereby we see that the in fluence of fatigue swells from o542 to o772 that is from being I5 to being 35 of all the sources of variation in cutaneous sensitivity Such a result has a very different scientific sig nificance from say any conclusion that the average sensory threshold had enlarged by so many more millimetres 1 Hence when the correlation is very complete say over 075 the above formula gives appreciably too large values as the amount reaches 090 and i the first factor must be reduced from 32 to 54 and I respectively 2 This as is well known consists in determining the least distance apart at which two points of contact can be distinguished as being double and not single SAssuming that is to say that all the boys become fatigued by the lessons 84 SPEARMAN MEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATION Moreover our test can be easily and precisely compared with any of the various other recommended procedures being more reliable than all which present smaller correlations and vice versa c Method of class averages It often happens that measurements or ranks are known but not in such a way as to be able to use either the method of  product moments or even any of the methods of Pearson Under such circumstances I have found it very useful to be able to apply the following relation d r D More accurately r  sin  a b 2 ab where d is the observed difference between the average meas urement or rank of the Ps accompanied by Q I and that of those accompanied by Q II and D is the greatest difference that was possible such as would have occurred had the cor respondence been perfect If Q has been divided into two about equal portions D will be equal to twice the middle or quartile deviation from the average in the whole series P while if Q has been divided after the usual fashion into three such portions only the two outer ones can be used and then D  287 times the above middle deviation again taken in the whole series P Suppose for example that we wish to ascertain whether the well known test of reactiontime gives any indication as to the persons general speed of movement We try a hundred persons both in reactiontime and in speed of running 50 yards Then we divide the reactiontime records into two classes I containing all the quickest performers and II all the slowest We now see how long these two classes of reacters took respec tively to run the fifty yards and what was the middle deviation from the average among all the runners taken together Let us put the average of class I at 6 seconds that of class II at 65 seconds and the general middle deviation at II seconds Then 65 6 r 12 X II 23 The evidential value of the result is given approximately even for small values of n by the following relation II7   I probable error n  Vn Vn 2 where n is the total number of cases considered In the three 85fold instead of twofold division the probable error becomes nearly 14 Vn  i 7n n  2 In the above instance we find that the observed correlation is little over double the probable error as so much would turn up about once in six times by mere accident the evidence is not at all conclusive Therefore we must either observe many more cases  600 would be necessary to reduce the probable error to i5th of the correlation  or else we must find a better method of calculation If rank had been employed instead of measurement the evidence would already have been fairly good and could have been put beyond all reproach by the addition of another r50 observations If rank had been em ployed in conjunction with the method of product moments or that of rank differences the required smallness of proba ble error could have been obtained by as few as 36 cases in all The method of class averages is especially Valuable in deciphering the results of other investigators where the average performances and the middle deviation are usually given in good work but not the data required for any of the other methods d Method of rank differences This method appears to deserve mention also seeing that it seems to unite the facility of the auxiliary methods with a maximum accuracy like that given by product moments It depends upon noting how much each individuals rank in the one faculty differs from his rank in the other one evidently this will be nil when the correlation is perfect and will increase as the correlation diminishes This general idea seems to have been first due to Binet and Henri La fatigue intellectuelle p 252261 who however do not work it out far enough to obtain any definite measure of correlation Ac cordingly Binet makes little further attempt in later research Lann6e psychologique Vol IV to render it of service and soon appears to have altogether dropped it Lann6e psychologique Vol VI The same idea occurred to myself and was developed as above with out being at the time acquainted with the previous work in this direc tion by Binet and Henri In obtaining the above formulae I was greatly assisted by Dr G Lipps showing generally that when an urn contains n balls numbered I 2 3    n respectively and when they are all drawn in turn without being replaced and when the differ ence is each time noted between the number on the ball and the order of its drawing then the most probable or middle total sum of such n2 I differences added together without regard to sign will be    Previously I had only calculated this value for each particular size of n required by myself Prof Hausdorff further showed generally that such sum of differences will present a mean square deviation from the above most probable value

correlation direct or inverse This method though very accurate and preeminently quick in application has unfortunately four serious disadvantages It can be only used for ranks and not immediately for meas urements The probable error given is only that showing how great correlations may be expected from pure accident when there is no really existing correspondence between the two characteris tics It does not like Pearsons probable error for the method of  product moments  directly show how much the observed correlation may be expected to differ by accident from any cor respondence that does exist The various possible values of Sd are found to fall into a frequency curve of marked asymmetry so that we cannot as in all the other methods here given take the minus values of R as representing so much inverse correlation This defect could be remedied mathematically but there are also other respects in which this side of the frequency curve appears un suitable for our purpose so that it is better to treat every cor This formula becomes slightly incorrect whenever two or more individuals are bracketed as having precisely the same rank but the consequent error is usuallytoo small to be worth considering 87SPEARMAN relation as positive which can always be done by if necessary inverting the order of one of the series Finally this value R is not numerically equivalent to the r found by all the other methods but for chance distribu tions appears  r So far the proof of this relation is only empirical but it rests on a large number of cases taken how ever only between 020 and o60 If it be accepted r can at once be found from the following table R 005 oio 020 030 040 050 o6o 070 o80 090 I r 013 022 034 044 054 063 071 079 086 093 I PART II CORRECTION OF SYSTEMATIC DEVIATIONS i Systematic Deviations Generally In the first part we have seen that any correlational experi ments however extensive can only be regarded as a sample out of the immense reality and will consequently present a certain amount of accidental deviation from the real general tendency we have further seen that this accidental deviation is measurable by the probable error whose determination therefore becomes an indispensable requisite to all serious research But now we are in danger of falling from Scylla into Charyb dis For after laboriously compiling sufficient cases and conscientiously determining the probable error there exists a very human tendency to cease from labor and inwardly rejoice at having thus risen from common fallacious argument to the serene certainty of mathematics But whether or not such complacency may be justifiable in pure statistical inquiry it is at any rate altogether premature in the kind of research that we are at present contemplating we are not dealing with sta tistics but with a line of work so fundamentally different that it may be aptly distinguished by the term of  statisticoids Here the accidental deviation is not the sole one nor even the most momentous there are many other enemies who are un moved by the most formidable array of figures These consist in such deviations as instead of merely being balanced imper fectly lie wholly on the one side or the other As in ordinary measurements so too in correlation we may speak not only of  accidental variable or compensating inaccura cies but also of systematic constant or  noncompen sating  ones These systematic deviations are of very varied nature the most insidious being as usual selfsuggestion To take for instance one of our recent examples suppose that we have applied the Griessbach test to a number of children before and 88MEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATION after their lessons and have found the desired correlation be tween fatigue and cutaneous insensitivity it still remains ex ceedingly difficult to convince ourselves that we executed our tests entirely without favor or affection for it is almost im possible to determine a series of sensory thresholds without some general tendency either to bring them towards the desired shape or elseendeavoring to escape such biasto force them in the opposite direction To convince others of our impartiality may be harder still Even this sort of devia tion is to be remedied by our proposed exact method of pro cedure for by it we obtain perfectly definite results which any impartial experimenters may positively corroborate or refute 2 Attenuation by Errors From page 74 it will be obvious that a correlation does not simply depend on the amount of concording factors in the two compared series but solely on the proportion between these concording elements on the one hand and the discording ones on the other In our example it did not matter whether A and B each had one pound or a thousand pounds in the com mon funds but only whether the amount was a small or large fraction of their whole incomes If the discordance i  x be nil then the concordance x is thereby perfect that is  I and if the influence of the discordant elements be sufficiently increased then any concordance will eventually become infi nitely small To consider a still more concrete example suppose three balls to be rolled along a wellkept lawn then the various dis tances they go will be almost perfectly correlated to the various forces with which they were impelled But let these balls be cast with the same inequalities of force down a rough moun tain side then the respective distances eventually attained will have but faint correspondence to the respective original momenta Thus it will be clear that here the accidental deviations have a new consequence simultaneous with but quite distinct from that discussed in the last chapter For there they impartially augmented and diminished the correlation tending in a pro longed series to always more and more perfectly counterbalance one another and in ordinary measurements this is their sole result But here in correlations they also have this new effect which is always in the direction of attenuating the apparent correspondence and whose amount depending solely on the size of the middle error cannot be in the least eliminated by This fact has already been mathematically expressed in the last chapter by the value of correlation between two series being propor tional inversely to the value of the middle deviations inside the series see p 86 89SPEARMAN any prolongation of the series The deviation has thus become general or systematic Now suppose that we wish to ascertain the correspondence between a series of values p and another series q By prac tical observation we evidently do not obtain the true objective values p and q but only approximations which we will call p and q Obviously p is less closely connected with q than is p with q for the first pair only correspond at all by the inter mediation of the second pair the real correspondence between p and q shortly rpq has been attenuated into rpq To ascertain the amount of this attenuation and thereby dis cover the true correlation it appears necessary to make two or more independent series of observations of both p and q Then r   rpq pq Vrpprqq where rp q  the mean of the correlations between each series of values obtained for p with each series ob tained for q rpp  the average correlation between one and another of these several independently obtained series of values for p rqq  the same as regards q and rpq  the required real correlation between the true objective values of p and q Thus if for each characteristic two such independent series of observations be made say p P2 q and q2 then the true pq  plq2  rp2q  rp2q2 pq 4  rpP Xr q PlP2 A qi Should circumstances happen to render say Pl much more accurate than P2 then the correlations involving Pt will be considerably greater than those involving P2 In such case the numerator of the above fraction must be formed by the geometrical instead of by the arithmetical mean hereby the accidental errors of the respective observations cease to elimi nate one another and therefore double their final influence they also introduce an undue diminution of the fraction In some exceptional and principally very theoretical cases it may happen that either of the actual measurements say p is 1 By an inversion of the above formula the correlation between two series of observations will be found a useful measure of the accuracy of the observations 90MEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATION connected with q or q quite independently of p or any other link common to p Then the correlation rp q will be to that extent increased without any proportional increase in rpp hence our above formula will fallaciously present too large a value A greater practical difficulty is that of obtaining two series sufficiently independent of one another For many errors are likely to repeat themselves even two separate observers are generally to some extent warped by the same influences we are all imposed on by not only the Idola Specus but also the Idola Tribus and the Idola Fori In such case the above formula is still valid only its correction does not go quite far enougha fallacy at any rate on the right side An actual instance will best show the urgent necessity of correcting this attenuation In a correlation between two events say P and Q I obtained three independent observations both of P and of Q The average correlation for those of P with those for Q was o38  rp q the average correlation of those for P with one another was 058  rp p the same for Q was 022  rqq Therefore the correspondence between the real events P and Q comes by reckoning to 038 03  approximately i so that the correspondence Vo 58 X 022 instead of being merely 038 appeared to be absolute and com plete Attenuation by errors can also be corrected in another man ner which has the great advantage of an independent empirical basis and therefore of not being subject to either of the two above mentioned fallacies besetting the other method Hence when the results coincide both ways the fallacies in question may thereby be considered as disproved for it is very unlikely that they should both be present and in such proportions as to exactly cancel one another In this method instead of directly employing the values pi P2 p3 etc we amalgamate them into a single list by this means we clearly eliminate some portion of the individual observational errors and thereby we cause any really existing correspondence to reveal itself in greater completeness Now this increase in correlation from this par tial elimination of errors will furnish a measure of the increase to be expected from an entire elimination of errors Assuming the mean error to be inversely proportional both to this in crease in the correlation and to the square root of the number of lists amalgamated the relation will be mnrpfqf  rp q rq p4 q mnI pq  4Vmn  I 9tSPEARMAN where m and n  the number of independent gradings for p and q respectively rp  the mean correlation between the various gradings for p and those for q and rpq  the correlation of the amalgamated series for p with the amalgamated series for q In the above quoted instance the three observations for series P were amalgamated into a single list and similarly those for series Q Upon this being done the two amalgama ted lists now presented a correlation with one another of no less than 066  rpq Thus by this mode of reckoning the real correspondence became v 3X3Xo66 o38  43 3  once more approximately i  3X3 1 so that this way also the correspondence advanced from o 38 to absolute completeness If more than two independent series of observations are available we may acquire additional evidence by trying the effect of partial amalgamation Instead of throwing all our obtained values together we may form a set of smaller combi nations for each of the two compared characteristics and then see the mean correlation between one set and the other In our above instance instead of summarily considering pi P2 Pa we can have Pi P2 p aP p  and find out their mean correlation with similar values for q This works out actually to 055 Hence rpq  2 X 2 X o 55  o38  approximately i 2X2 X I Thus again by this third way where both terms are the mean of 9 observed correlational values the correspondence once more rises from the apparent o38 to the real I1 3 limits of Associative Problems We have seen that the length of the arm is said to be cor related with that of the leg because a person with a long arm has usually a long leg and conversely  also that this corre lation is defined mathematically by any constant which deter The exactness of the coincidence between the two methods of cor rection is in the above instance neither greater nor less than generally occurs in practice It was singled out in order to show that the formulae still hold perfectly good even for such an enormous rise as from 038 to i The possibility of such a rise is due to the unusual conditions of the experiment in question whereby the three observa tions of the same objective series presented the extraordinarily small intercorrelation of 022 92MEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATION mines the function of any definite size of arm to the mean of the sizes of the corresponding legs These terms taken literally are very wide reaching and express what we will call the uni versal  correlation between the two organs But evidently not the most painstaking investigation can possibly secure any adequately representative sample for such universal correlations even in the simple case of arms and legs To begin with they would have to be equally derived from every stage of growth including all the prenatal period since this is the most influential of all causes of variation in size In the next place they would have to come from every historical epoch containing their fair proportion of big CroMagnons little Furfoozers etc Further they must impartially include every living race from the great Patagonians to the diminutive MKabbas also every social class from the tall aristocrats to the undersized slummers Practically then the universal correlation even if desirable is quite inaccessible We are forced to successively introduce a large number of restrictions the sample is confined to adults to moderns to some particular country etc etc In a word we are obliged to deal with a special correlation When we proceed to more narrowly consider these restric tions it soon becomes clear that they are far from being really detrimental For every serious investigation will be found to be directed however vaguely and unconsciously by some hy pothesis as to the causes both of the correspondence and of the digression therefrom see page 74 This hypothesis will de termine a particular system of restrictions such as to set the correspondence in the most significant relief But from these restrictions will at the same time proceed several kinds of grave errors In the first place since the re strictions are not explicitly recognized they often are not carried out in a manner scientifically profitable then the re sult however true may nevertheless be trivial and unsugges tive For instance a series of experiments was recently exe cuted by one of our best known psychologists and endedto his apparent satisfactionin showing that some childrens schoolorder was largely correlated with their height weight and strength As however no steps had been taken to ex clude the variations due to difference of age the only reason able conclusion seemed to be that as children grow older they both get bigger and go up in the school Such explanation turned out in fact to probably be the true and sufficient one The next fault to be feared is equivocality For even if the controlling underthought be good yet its indistinctness in the mind of the experimenter causes the restriction to be carried out so unsystematically that the results inevitably become am biguous and fruitless 93The last is that even with the clearest purpose this speciali zation of the correlation is an exceedingly difficult matter to execute successfully Only by a profound knowledge of the many factors involved can we at all adequately exclude those irrelevant to our main intention Now all such elements in a correlation as are foreign to the investigators explicit or implicit purpose will like the atten uating errors constitute impurities in it and will quantitatively falsify its apparent amount This will chiefly happen in two ways 4 Constriction and Dilation Any correlation of either of the considered characteristics will have been admitted irrelevantly if it has supervened irre spectively of the original definition of the correspondence to be investigated The variations are thereby illegitimately con strained to follow some irrelevant direction so that as in the case of Attenuation they no longer possess full amplitude of possible correlation in the investigated direction the maximum instead of being I will be only a fraction and all the lesser de grees of correspondence will be similarly affected such a falsi fication may be called constriction Much more rarely the converse or dilation will occur by correlations being irrele vantly excluded The disturbance is measurable by the follow ing relation r p rpq rPqVirpv rpq  I  rpv where rpq  the apparent correlation of p and q the two variables to be compared rpv  the correlation of one of the above variables with a third and irrelevantly admitted variable v and rpq the real correlation between p and q after com pensating for the illegitimate influence of v Should any further irrelevant correlation say rpw be ad mitted then r  rI pq qI r2 2rP p i  rpv rpw In the reverse case of dilation r  1 r  Vir2  r pq pq  rpV r2pw These formula will be easily seen to be at once derivable from the relations stated on pages 74 and 75 Small irrelevant 94 SPBARMANMEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATION variations evidently do not affect the result in any sensible degree while large ones are capable of revolutionizing it The following is an actual illustration of this constriction I was investigating the correspondence between on the one hand intelligence at school lessons and on the other the faculty of discriminating musical pitch The correlation proved to be 049 But upon inquiry it turned out that more than half of the children took lessons in music and therefore enjoyed artifi cial training as regards pitch here then was a powerful cause of variation additional and quite irrelevant to the research which dealt with the correspondence between the two natural faculties When this disturbant had once been detected there was no difficulty in eliminating its influence by the above formula the correspondence between pitch discrimination and music lessons was measured at o6I so that the true required correlation became 04962   00 6 2 VJI o6I2 In this particular case the more desirable course was open of eliminating the constriction practically by confining the experiment to those children who were learning music and therefore were on a sufficient equality as regards the training The correlation then gained in this purely empirical way exactly coincided with the former result being again 062 5 Distortion Whereas Attenuation and Constriction have wholly tended to reduce the apparent correlation and Dilation to enlarge it we now come to a third kind of impurity that may equally well reduce or enlarge Its effect is thus analogous to the first con sequence of accidental errors discussed in the first part of this article but unlike the latter this Distortion does not in the least tend to eliminate itself in the longest series of observations Distortion occurs whenever the two series to be compared together both correspond to any appreciable degree with the same third irrelevant variant In this case the relation is given by rlpq rpv rqv 1 rpq i Ir2pv ir rqv where r  the apparent correlation between p and q the Pq two characteristics to be compared rpv and rqv the correlations of p and q with some third and perturbing variable v This same formula has already been arrived at though along a very different route by Yule See Proc R S L Vol LX 95and rpq  the required real correlation between p and q after compensating for the illegitimate influence of v Should the common correspondence with v have been irrele vantly excluded instead of admitted the relation becomes rq  rlpq   rp I  rqv  rpvr qv In the course of the same investigation above alluded to but in another school the correlation between school intelligence and discrimination of pitch turned out to be o 25 so that ap parently not the cleverer but the stupider children could dis criminate best But now it was observed that a superiority in discrimination had been shown by the older children amount ing to a correlation of 055 while for a then unknown reason the schoolmasters estimate of intelligence had shown a very marked though unconscious partiality for the younger ones amounting to a correlation of o 65 Hence the true correlation reckoned out to 025  055 X 065  I  o552 I   o65 2   o I7 This latter low but direct correlation was  under the particular circumstances of the experiment  unquestion ably about correct so that the one originally observed of 025 would have been entirely misleading 6 Criticism of Prevalent Working Methods So far our illustration of systematic deviation has been con fined to instances taken from personal experience But it might perhaps be thought that other workers avoid such per versions of fact by the simpler method of common sense Un fortunately such does not seem to have been at all the case not once to the best of my knowledge has any partial associa tion between two psychological events been determined in such a way as to present any good evidential valuethese are strong terms but I think hardly exaggerated Psychologists with scarcely an exception never seem to have become acquainted with the brilliant work being carried on since I886 by the GaltonPearson school The consequence has been that they do not even attain to the first fundamental requisite of correlation namely a precise quantitative expres sion Many have indeed taken great pains in the matter and have constructed arrays of complicated numerical tables but when we succeed in orienting ourselves in the somewhat be wildering assemblage of figures we generally find that they have omitted precisely the few facts which are essential so that we cannot even work out the correlation for ourselves This lack of quantitative expression entails far more than merely diminished exactitude For in consequence the ex 96 SPEARMAN MEASUREMBNT OF ASSOCIATION perimenters have been unable to estimate their own results at all correctly some have believed themselves to demonstrate an entire absence of correspondence when the latter has really been quite considerable whereas others have presented to the public as a high correlation what has really been very small and often well within the limits of jmere accidental coincidence these limits they have had no means of determining and more over their data were usually obtained in such a way as to make it unnecessarily large Seeing thus that even the elementary requirements of good correlational work described in the first part of this article have been so generally deficient we cannot be surprised to find that the more advanced refinements of procedure discussed in the second part have been almost wholly unregarded so that the final results are saturated and falsified with every descrip tion of impurity In this respect unfortunately it is no longer possible to hold up even the GaltonPearson school as a model to be imitated The latter must now perform the very different office of saving us from detailed criticism of inferior work by enabling us to form an opinion as to how far the defect perme ates and vitiates even the best existent correlational research As example we will take Pearsons chief line of investiga tion Collateral Heredity at that point where it comes into closest contact with our own topic Psychology Since I898 he has with government sanction and assistance been collect ing a vast number of data as to the amount of correspondence existing between brothers A preliminary calculation based in each case upon 800 to Iooo pairs led in I90o to the publi cation of the following momentous results COEFFICIENTS OF COLLATERAI HBIREDITY Correlation of Pairs of Brothers PHYSICAL CHARACTERS MENTAL CHARACTERS Family Measurements School Observations Stature 05107 Intelligence 04559 Forearm 04912 Vivacity 04702 Span 05494 Conscientiousness 05929 Eyecolor 05169 Popularity 05044 School Observations Temper 05068 Selfconsciousness 059I5 Cephalic index o4861 Shyness 05281 Haircolor 05452 Health 05203 Mean 05I71 Mean 05214 Dealing with the means for physical and mental characters we are forced to the perfectly definite conclusion that the JOURNAL7 97SPEARMAN mental characters in man are inherited in precisely the same man ner as the physical Our mental and moral nature is quite as much as our physical nature the outcome of hereditary factors Now let us consider how these coefficients of correlation will be affected by our systematic deviations To begin with there is the Attenuation by errors since it evidently cannot be assumed that the schoolmasters judgments as to conscien tiousness temper etc are absolutely infallible On page 90 it has been shown that deviation from this source may be esti mated by the following formula rpq rpq  rpprqTq To ascertain rpp and rq qr I am aware of no precise data be yond that found in some experiments of my own where the independent intellectual gradings for the same series of sub jects correlated with one another on an average to the amount of o 64 As on other occasions very competent persons have estimated this to be as much as should be expected and as intelligence is about the most easily gradableof all the mental qualities mentioned by Pearson there is so far no reason to suppose that his great number of masters and mistresses did on the whole any better Hence even if we could assume that the mistakes in estimating one brother were independent of the mistakes in estimating the other then the true correlation would be about not 05172 but 05172 o 8 an Vo64 X o 64 extent of difference that seriously modifies our impression of exactitude from all these coefficients to four places of decimals When we further consider that each of these physical and men tal characteristics will have quite a different amount of such error in the former this being probably quite insignificant it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the remarkable coin cidence announced between physical and mental heredity can hardly be more than mere accidental coincidence Let us next proceed to irrelevant correlation and take for our theme postnatal accidents connected on the one side with brotherhood and on the other with the mental qualities Pear sons primary intention seems to have been to make his corre lation as universal as possible and in one place he expressly mentions that education is among the causes contributory to variation Hence he is no more than consistent in that he forms his correlation without regard to the fact that the cor respondence between the brothers conscientiousness  popu 1The italics are Pearsons 98MEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATION larity etc must be in great measure due to their coming under the same home influences But such a correlation can scarcely be accepted as scientifically valuable For we do not really know anything precise about the assimilating effects of heredity when our observed correspondence is perhaps chiefly due to the brothers having been similarly brought up  or even to such accidents as their being equally well dressed and having the same amount of hampers and pocketmoney Still less can we then fairly compare such a result with that obtained from physical measurements where common home life has little or no effect The factor of postnatal accidents therefore cannot but be regarded as irrelevant and consequently the co efficients of correlation must betaken as hopelessly distorted But even consistence cannot be upheld throughout the matter For though the effect of postnatal life has thus been admitted with regard to education at home it has perforce been excluded as regards public education For only those brothers have been compared together who are at the same school the coeffi cients of correlation would certainly diminish if those also could be included who are living in a totally different manner have gone to sea etc The correlations are therefore also illegitimately dilated If this work of Pearson has thus been singled out for criti cism it is certainly from no desire to undervalue it The above and any other systematic errors are eventually capable of ade quate elimination and this article has itself it is hoped been of some use towards that purpose Such correction will no doubt necessitate an immense amount of further investigation and labor but in the end his results will acquire all their proper validity My present object is only to guard against premature conclusions and to point out the urgent need of still further improving the existing methodics of correlational work a method of investigation which he himself has so largely helped to create and by means of which he is carrying light into im mense regions hitherto buried in the obscurity of irresponsible speculation The fundamental difference between his proced ure and that here recommended is that he seeks large natural samples of any existing series sufficiently homogeneous to be treated mathematically whereas here smaller samples are deemed sufficient but they are required to be artificially selected ordered and corrected into full scientific significance His methods are those of pure statistics those inculcated here may be more aptly termed statisticoids 7 Number of Cases Desirable for an Experiment This leads us to the important question as to how many cases it is advisable to collect for a single series of experiments In actual practice the greatest diversity has been apparent in 99this respect many have thought to sufficiently establish im portant correlations with less than ten experimental subjects while others have thought it necessary to gather together at least over a thousand Now a series of experiments is a very limited extract whose disposition is nevertheless to be accepted as a fair sample of the whole immense remainder Other things equal then the larger the sample the greater its evidential value and the less chance of a mere occasional coincidence being mistaken for the permanent universal tendency This danger of accidental deviation has been discussed in the first part and there shown to be strictly measurable by the probable error We there saw also that this danger can never be entirely eliminated by any sample however large so that it is necessary to accept some standard less rigorous than absolute certainty as sufficient for all practical purposes usually the danger of mere chance coincidence is considered to be inap preciable when a correlation is observed as much as five times greater than the probable error seeing that mere chance would not produce this once in a thousand times Hence evidently the accidental deviation depends not only on the number of cases but also on the largeness of the really existing corres pondence the more perfect the latter the fewer the cases that will be required to demonstrate it conclusively and this ten dency is augmented by the fact that the probable error besides varying inversely with n does so to a further extent with r see formula It was shown in the same part that the size of the probable error also varies according to the method of calculationand to such an extent that twenty cases treated in one of the ways described furnish as much certitude as I80 in another more usual way If the common trifold classification be adopted an even greater number is required to effect the same purpose and if the correlation be not calculated quanti tatively at all but instead be presented in the customary fashion to the readers general impression then no number of cases whatever appear sufficient to give reasonable guarantee of proof While thus the number of subjects is not by any means the sole factor in diminishing even the accidental deviation it has no effect whatever upon the far more formidable systematic devia tion except that it indirectly leads to an enormous augmenta tion thereof When we are taking great pains to be able to show upon paper an imposing number of cases and a diminutive probable error we are in the self same process most likely in troducing a systematic deviation twenty times greater From all this we may gather that the number of cases should be determined by the simple principle that the measurements to be aggregated together should have their error brought to IO0 SPEARMANMEASUREMENT OF ASSOCIATION IOI the same general order of magnitude An astronomical chronom eter with springdetent escapement is not the best travelling clock nor is there any real advantage in graving upon a mile stone as has actually been done by an infatuated mathemati cian the distance to the nearest village in metres to three decimal places Now the present stage of Correlational Psy chology is one of pioneering and instead of a few unwieldy experiments we require a large number of small ones carefully carried out under varied and well considered conditions At the same time however the probable error must be kept down to limits at any rate small enough for the particular object of investigation to be proved For such a purpose a probable error may at present be admitted without much hesitation up to about o05 so that by adopting the method of calculation recommended two to three dozen subjects should be sufficient for most purposes The precision can always be augmented subsequently by carrying out similar experiments under simi lar conditions and then taking averages Only after a long preliminary exploration of this rougher sort shall we be in a position to effectually utilize experiments designed and executed from the very beginning on a vast scale

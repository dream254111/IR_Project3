bargain with him for horses The horses herc wele not only as good as those of Gerll beh and Nen1beh but likewise cheaper and more docile On the th of June we remairled encamped at Kulsha E lakes whele 132 excellent horses were delivered to me and these on the followinC day I sent of to Benal in charCe of Lielltenant Harvey toCether with my sick interpreter and eiCht sepoys All these horses were unfortunately seized by the Mahrattas causing me subses quently much unpleasantness from which howearer I freed myself thank God with honour  Our enjoyment of the plain was not of lonffl duration as it terminated at lalikbar spring where the mountains commenced aCain We found it necessary to relieve our jaded camels here of a portion of their packs which we transferred to the mules The road led us llp to Kishtur Mountain and frorrt its summit we descended into a valley teeming with gadflies which irritated and annoyed our cattle exceedinCly These insects accompanied us as far as VaChin Mountain which stands alone in the fertile Garil Valley A few par sanas northwards between two small salt lakes is Fulma the first villaCe of the BelorGabsus who closely resemble the BelorOmbos exceptinC that the villaCes of the brmer are sllrrounded by courts and gardens At the fbot of Kor Mountain within a short distance of the above villaCe there are some mines of natiere copper and

rivulet a quarrel arose between my people and the natives whicl IrliCrkt have ended ver seriously as one of nzy men had already l3een wounded in the head by a stone hurled from a slincr in the use of which the llatiVes are very dexterous It cost me considerable trouble to restore peace and this I was able to do only owinC to the good nature of the natives my people bein entirely to blame in the matter  In a bload and very deep defile surrotlnded by very high escarpments and between Valbuni and Pazilunar moulltains the traveller arlives at Lake Valbllni the water of which is bright green and apparently unfathomable Several stleams feed this lake which contains an abundance of trout these were often seen pursued by large pike locally called bulteb There is also a very rich copl ermine in the vicinity of Aclkir and Lulsi Lopsha  mollntailas xvorlted by the inhabitants of NlarenC village It is flom this abllndance of copper  These were in all probability Buruts who also nomadise on the western side of the Bolor range along the upper sources of the Oxus and amidst the settle ments of the Belors as is to be seen from Woods accountNote of Veniakof t In working irl the itinerary of our traveller on the map Lake Kulsha and the surrouding high plateau occurred exactly at that spot which orl other maps is represented as the interveniIlg part between Saryliul the source of the Oxus and Karakul out of which issues one of the affluents of the YarkendDaria According to Woods observations the western extrenlity of Sarykul lies under lat 37 27 and long 91 20 of Ferro Our traveller gives 30 for the latitude of Kulsha lakes but it must be observed that all his latitudes are excessive If we suppose that in calculating his observations he made a mistake with regard to the suns edge and make an allowance of 3i for the apparent diameter of the sun we shall arrive at 37 27 as given by Wood Further our allthor places Cashmere at 34 27 whereas it is situated in 34 4 6 the difirence of 32

territory  On some wooded heiglzts to the left we observed the two Chinese forts of Kalga and Zartig from which pickets were stationed along the bank of the liver AYhen travelling through the Belor country I assumed by way of precaution the character of an Armenian merchant bollold to Kashgar with a slzlall caravan In this chalacter the customhouse officers allowed me to lzass without any

Chinese commandallt who enjoys the title of ahartty uheridy I was sulDplied by him witll a passport to which was fixed a large seal called the tcumya and on receipt of this document I was able to

Here we shall conclude our extracts from the account of the  Journey throutll Upper Asia On the 3rd of July Geor Ludwig 7on  reached the town of Bolor and remained there several weels at tbe request of the Chinese Gelleral proceeding afterwards to Badakhshan with regard to which touTn he observes consistently with the testimony from other sources that it i peopled by Mahometans At this point of his journey Georg Ludwig VOll  quitted for a tirile the country of tlle Belors and entered that of the Tadjiks From hence he again journeyed northwards and must have once more encountered the foraler race nalnely at Vokhan I say must have because one passage in tlle Chillese geography adduced by ElaplsothX bears incontestable evidence of Yokhan being peopled by an ludian race differing entirely from the Alahometan Buruts Turkistallis and Tadjiks I hare already given some account of Vokhan in my article on the Pamir l shall therefore merely observe here that the Chinese geography and itinerary translated in 1821 bear uniform evidence that a road RUl1S from this small town to Kashtar past Lake Ijarikkul or immediately across the axis of the Bolor Mountains This doubtless is the same road along which the Chinese geIleral Fude proceeded to Badakhshan with a large army when in pursuit of Borollda and Hozitcllman so celebrclted in the history of Eastern Turkestan It is inerestiIln to find that the Chillese geography affords us an idea of the former populollsness of these parts According to this testlmony the slllall Bolor territory contained towards the middle of the last century a population of 30000 families ill the vclley of the Bolor River while that of Badakhshan amounted to 100000 families Trom this it will le seen that this region is zzot so thinly inhabited as its rnountainous and elevated situatioll would lead one to suppose In order to elucidate the accompanying mapX I shall now in conclusion recur to some of the accounts given by other European travellers namely Burnes and AVood respecting the limits of dis tribution of the Belors and other IZaffir tribes The first of these travellers distinctly states tllat tlle illhabitants of Badakhshan are  Klaproth Magasin Asiatique vol i p 92 I am inclilled to think that the Belors partly populate the llorthern portions of Badakhshan if we may judge from the local lwames of objects in that part In constructing my map however I did not vellture to adopt this supposition chiefly because it is scarcely possible that the heathen Belors could remain independent subjects of a Mussulma kingdom like BadakhshanNote of VenikofvENtUKOF on the Belors and tAleir Country 279 Tadjiks i e a race akin to the Iranian Persians It is only the rulers of this principality wio lay claim to a descent from Alexander the Great that is to say to a nonAsiatic origin Hence it would appear that the Belors do not spread into the valley of the Sharud and are rtlost probably confined to the valley of the Bolor Ri7er On the other hand however we read on the same authority that the Khan of Kunduz had succeeled in subjecting Chitral to his rule and was in receipt of tribute from this town in slaves whoul he usually lespatched to Bukhara for sale This anain evidently refers to unbelievers or Iiaffirs who as Burnes states speak a distinct dialect NVood likewise in the valley of the AmuDalia or Pandj beyond IshKashm Pass met Witll a strange race of people who interested him no less than the Pamir Kirghizes these latter having strayed beyond their usual haunts at the period of AVoods visit He illforms us that among the former he found some traces of the dctrines of Zoroaster and also saw two ruined temples A11 this testimony tends to define the western limits of prevalence of this enigmatical race while with regard to their northern limits of distribution we possess the testimony of our traveller Georg Ludwig von in two places of his narrative and also of that of Klaproth The southern limits of the Kaffir Sahpushes have for some years past been pretty accurately defined on European maps from the accounts supplied by Elphin3tone Burnes and others Their eastern limits howeve the evidence of Chinese geography notwithstanding cannot yet be fixed with any certainty in the absence of more accurate ethnological data In all probability the inhabitants of Iskardo Gilgit alld of the parts adjoining Karshu are of this race lo prove this it is requisite to obtain correct physiological and linguistic data Even a brief vocabulary of the dialect spoken there would be of the greatest value and a philological examination of the words of the lialect of Chitral cited by Burnes and of the dictionary of the Dardu larlguaCe cornpiled by Cllnningham would prove ex ceedingly interesting  XXI On the Explorcltion of the Xorth Polar Regzon By Captain SHERARD OSBORN RN CB iPead January 23 1865 ARaTIa discovery however imperfectly treated must always I feel sure claim the

the worldwide sympathy in the noble devotion by which that mystery xvas solved I need not therefore offer an apology to the members of the Royal Geographical Society for any effort upon my part to show the perfect practicability of an exploration of the blank space around OU1 Nortllern Pole and to place before you opinions entertained by myself and those of lny brother Arctic explorers who do wot belont to the new school of  rest and be thankful  men either in science or naval achievementS and tho are no more prepared to turn their backs upon the Arctic Regions because FrankliIl died of King Villiams Land than you would wish them to do so to an enerrlys fleet because Nelson fell at TrafalCar In tile year 1818 Baffins discoveries upon the one hand and those of Behrint upon the other with dots for the mouths of the AIackenzie alld Hearn rivers was a11 we knew of the strange labyrillth of lands and waters now accurately delineated upon our charts of the Arctic Zone Sailor3 and trlvellers iil thirtysix years have accomplished all this not always be it remembered in wellstored ships sailing rapidly from point to point but for the most part by patiently toiling on foot or coasting in open boats round every bay and fiord Sir Leopold McClintock tells the ltoyal lublin Society that he estirnates the foot explorations accoznplished in the search for Franklin alone at abotlt 400 miles Yet during those thirtysiXx years of glorious enterprise by sllip by boat and by sledge England only fairly lost one expedi tion and 128 sollls out of fortytwo successive expeditions and has nexrer lost a sledgepartv out of about one hundred that have toiled within the Arctic Sircle Show me upon the globe7s surface an equal amount of geographical discovery or in history as arduous an achievement with a smaller amount of human sacrifice and then I will concele that Arctic exploration has entailed more than its due proportion of suffering rhey who assert tllat oxlr labours and researches have merely added so rnany miles of unprofitable coastline to our charts had better coznpare our knosledge of Arctic phenomena today with the theories enunciated by men cf learning and repute a century ago They should confront our knowledge of 18t4 with that of 1800 upon the natural history meteorology climate and winls of the Arctic Regions They must remember that it was there we obtained the clue still unravelled of the lawr of those onysteriolls currents which flow throufflh the wastes of the ocean like two mighty rivers the Gulf Stream and the Ice Stream they must relnember that it was there in Boothiathat the two Rosses first reached the AIagnetic Pole that naysterious point round whichthe Morth Pola7 Rey fon 281 rearolves the mariners compass over one half of the Northern hemisphere and let the world say whether the mass of observa tions colleeted by our explorers on all sides of that WIagnetic Pole have added nothing to the knowledge of the laws of magnetic declination and dip They should remember how a few years ato it was gravely debatel whether man could exist througil the ritrJurs and darkness of a Polar winter azad how we have ony reeently discovered that Providence has peopled that region to the extreme latitude yet reached and that the aninlals upon mrhich they subsist are there likewise in winter as well as in summer All this alld much more should be borne in mind by those cynics who would have you believe we have toiled ill vain and I hold with the late Admiral Beechey  that every voyage to the North has tended to remove that veil of obscurity n7hich previously hung over the geography and a11 the phenomena of the Arctic Regions Before those voyages all was darlSness aild terror all beyond the North ape a blank but since then each successive voyage has swept away some gloomy superstition has brouht to light some new phenomenon and tended to the advancement of hllman knowledCe I will llOt dwell upon the personal hardships or risks ineurred they ean be easily discounted at any Insurance Cornpany in the City of Lorldon alld thfe privations are best appreciated by those who have been sledging over the barren grounds of 76 s and are not scared by the recollection of cold finers and banian days Men do not volunteer for eertain death or starvation and I can only say that so poplllar is Arctic service with our sailors that I am frequently asked by old shipmates  Are we goirlg up that way again sir  Please dont forget I alrl a volunteer  The fac is more sailors have been thrown to the sharks from the diseases incident to service in China and the eoast of Africa within the last four years than ever fell in thirty years of Arctic service and our seamen and officers know it And after all the dangers of exploration in the nortll are those common to like undertakings in a11 unknown regiolls Speke and rallt seekirlg for the sources of the Nile Burton at Harar ireemont in the Sierra Nevada Livingstone on the Zambesi or Burke and Wlls in the hungry wilds of Central Australia have all moments of as great peril as Wane ever endured in Sluith Sound or McClure passed through in Bankss Land I will therefore without further preamble deal with the points which are the most impoltant for our eonsideration First The direction from which a Polar exploration should be undertaken with the least risk alld greatest probability of success Second The mode in whieh such an exploratioll should be exe cuted and the scientific results likely to accrue282 SHERARD OF3ORS 0H te wploaation  WYe have before us a circumpolar chart lIark the nearest known points to the Pole the extremes of Spitzbergen and North Greenland Let us first deal with Spitzberfflen fIakluyt Head is about 60 miles frortl the Pole in the last century the whale fishery was situated off that Capes and we have the conculrent testimony of all those ancient fisllermen to prove that the sea was often founal clear of ice for another hundred uliles further north I say therefore that sailingships hal7e been in that direction within 500 miles of the Pole For the information of those more sanguine than myself of the existence of open water at the Pole through the action of the Gulf Stream I annex a table collated by my kind friend Mr Markham from the data furnished to the Royal Society by the Hon Daines Barrington Colonel Beaufoy and others You will there find that stout old Dutch and English skippers vowed they had been as far north as the 88 some to 83 N and many into the 82 parallel indeed one old sailor declared to Master Moxon hydrotrapher to Charles II of glorious memoryf that  he had sailed two degrees beyond the Pole   but it is only fair to add that this wag said in dreamy Amsterdam over strong Outch beer I am content however to point to the position reached by the late Sir Edward Parry in his boat expedition from Spitzbergerl in 1827 There at any rate he stood UpOIl a floatillg sea of ice on the night of July 22 1827 being then in lat 82 45 N exactly 435 geographical miles from the Pole Ile was constrained to give up the attempt sitnply becallse the ice was being swept faster to the south than his mell could drag their boats to the north It was the height of the Arctic summer and all the icefields were in motion The experience of the last twenty years tells us that instead of starting on such a journey in Tune Parry ought to have wintered in Spitzbergen and started for the North iil February and such is the perfection to wllich Arctic sledgeequipment is now broutlt that the weirhts would be infirlitely less for the men to drag whil3t the provisions would last months illstead of weeks But there are great objections to any effort to reach the Polar area by sledges fiom Spitzbergen You will observe as yet no known lands exist UpOll its meridian and to tlle north of the island consequently rio fixed points br depots of provisions whereas in Smith Sound we have a startingpoint 120 miles nearer to the Pole and there is good ground for believing as I will show in a further extension of continents or islands upon the meridian of the American anl Greenland continerlts which is not the case in Spitzbergen For instance the floes which drift down upon Spitz bergen from the north colltain in their eonbrace no icebergs proper 8 See p 295tAle North Polar Reyfon 283 This tells us tllat no extensive lands lie upon that meridian for the ieeberg is a ereation of the lalld born of a glacier and not of the sea whereas these ieebergs abound in Smith Sound alld the glaeiers as Kane advaneed northward appeared to iIlerease rather than diminish in extent Brhieh would not be the ease if the land ended abruptly near the Humboldt Glaeier in 80 N latitude Ithose vast aeeurnlulations of snow and freshwater iee and their beautiful ereations the ieeberg tell us of great lancls with lofty mountains and deep valleys retaining the moisture and snowdrift of ages and promise that eontinuity of eoastline and that frozen seaboard which is only needed to enahle our explorers to reaeh the Pole in safety Greenland therefore and not Spitzbergen is the direetion I advoeate At the same time do not jump to the eollelusion that there is nothing to reward the explorer in the direetion of SpitzbertFen or Nova Zembla for there is mueh yet to be seen and done there in seientifie researeh The butbear of Aretie navigation is being gradually dispelled A Cruise in High Latitulles and  A Season among the Valruses encourate us to hope that where yachtsmen have not hesitated to go br pleasure alld where poor Norwegian fishermen yearly sail in almost open boats for hides ivory and the more precious livers of Aretie sharks which produee as you know  pure codliuer oil   it is possible other3 will yet wend their way for love of seienee and add to our knowledffle of the laws of eleetrieity light matnetism temperature and winds From Spitzbergen let us turn to Greenland In the year 1853 my lamented friend Dr Eane ellteretl Smith Sound at the head of Baffin Bay with his little brig the Advance At that time I was serving svith Capt Riehards the present Hydrographer of the Navy in an expedition in WATellington Channel under Sir Edward Beleher Kellett and tXcClintock wTere in Barrow Straits WIeClure had just reached the waters of the Atlantie from the Pacifie Ocean Sollinson and Rae were in ATictoria Land and Boothia and Inglefield had just made one of his summer trips to Beechey Island rrhere could IlOt have been less than four hundred British subjects within the Arctic seas All our ships had been admirably bund and our crews lived in comparative comfort for the re soulces of a nation and a great navy had been placed at our disposal Dr Kanes expedition was rather the result of private munificence and a generous impulse of irldividuals and it is only faIr to Dr Kane to say that never in our times has a navator entered the ice so indifferently prepared for a Polar winter Aith only seventeen followers two of them mutineers without a steam power for his solitary vessel without proper sledgeequipment without any preserved fresh meat and a great insufficiency of284 SHERARD OSBORN vn the gxyaatzoaa of preserved vegetables and with only coals enoull to scrve for twelve months fuel the only malvel to me is that he ever returned to relate his sufiierinfts They are ouly to be eqllalled by those of the navigator James in Hudson Bay two cellturies earlier God forbid tllat I should be thouht to cast one reflectiorl upon those warulhearted Americans who came nobly foru7ard and said AVe too will aid in Arctic enterprise  but tlle fact is that enthusiasm and hittll courate withollt proper knowledte and equipment must on such service infallibly lead to the suffering which Dr Kanes followers erldurel and it is that which best explains how it was that whilst our sailors far beyond the present haunts of Esquimaux waxed fat alld fastidious Is alles poor followers had to eat the raw flesh of animal3 to avert the ravaCes of scurvy brought on by a poisonous dietary of saltmeat This much to meet the objections of those who pont to Or Kanes thrilling narrative with a view to frighten us from Arctic explora tion and I may add that I know well that chivalrous man never penned those touching episodes to frighten men from high enter prise but rather to caution us to avoid his rnistakes and to show us how nobly the worst evils may be borne when the cause is a good one The brig Ablvance entered Smith Sound but departed fiom an Arctic canon by keeping upon the eastern or leeshore instead of the mrestern or weather shore she was quickly besetn and fell into a bay 60 miles further on out of which she never again sailed Ill the spring of 1854 a further exploration was accomplished of about 160 miles of the Greenland coast and the western land was observed for a still greater distance The extreme of Greenland visited was a point beyolld a stupendous tongue of the great glacier and named Cape Constitutioll by the only man Mr iNIorton who reached it This sailor could not get round the Cape because of water existing at the base of the clifls he coulll not scale the cliff because it was too steep what more there is therefore beyond Cape Constitution none of us know Rane thought it the termirlation of Greenland I entirely dissent from so hasty a conclusion becallse I cannot beliese that such a glacier as that of Humboldt ever bearing the hundreds of iceberg3 which Wane tells us of into the waters of Smith Sound was fed otherwise than by some extensive parelltglacier spread over a very great area and this proclclimsS in my opinion a ccntinuity of the Green land shore as there mas undoubtedly land on the opposite side as far as NIortoll could see Scrambling up the face of Cape ConstitutionS to the height of either 300 or 500 feet Atr BIortoll could see no ice to the svest ward to which I attach small iluportance never hasing myself seen floeice from any altitude at a greater distallce than 12the North Polur Reyion 285 miles but he did see land rolling away to the northward a b3ld but inlented coast he thinks with a fine range of mountains looming in the interior This land is aT propriately named Grinnell Land English and American hydrorraphers are at variance as to the assigned latitudes of Cape Constitution and Cape Parry the two extremes discovered by IVane I nincerely trust the American cornputation will prove correct Cape Constitution will then be in 81 22 N and tEle point seen on the west land would be in about 82 30 N or just 450 miles froul our Pole a distance equal to that of the Lalldis End from Balmoral But in order that we may deal with the subject from its worst poillt of view I am prepared to accept the more southern positions assigned to the extlennes bDz Adtniral Collinson Captain George and AIr Arrowsmith Tlley as you will observe place Cape Constitution in lat 80 56 N and credit 30Iortons vision with a range of 60 miles fixing Cape Parry in lat 81 56 only or a distance of 484 miles frozn the Pole I accept this as the distance mre have to deal with and declare that Cape and Grin nell Land as my assurance of the perfect possibility of reaching the Pole Cape Parry is as you see a fixed point more than a degree and a half nearer to the Pole than Hakluyt I4ead in Spitzbergen alld therefore the best point of departure for the exploration of the great unknowll space before us rhe listallce of Cape Parry to the Pole and back is just 968 miles a distance which has been repeatedly exceeded by our Arctic sledge and boat parties since the year 1850 and fala short of what we subsequently accomplished as I will presently showv But apart from mere proximity to the Pole there are other conditiolls which recommend this route to our consideration It will be remembered that at ape Corlstitution a consideralule extent of water was found to exist in the early sumuler Recent Arctic explorations have taught us that this is no great novelty Dr Kalle however believes it to be very exterlsive but as 1 have good reasons tor being sceptical upon this point and as the Pole iS within our reach whether Kanes Polynia be great or small I shall not urge the facilities which open water offiers to a boat navigation The future explorer miht hail open vvater if it were found to exist alont the sllores of Grinnell Land but if not he would be well satisfiXed with plenty of ice and merely pray that the mainland or offlyin islands shuld be found to exist as far as the 87th parallel And thfere is I hold more chancefar more chatlce of that beillg the case than of any open sea round ollr Aretic Pole But ltsllles Polynia evidently exists where there is a ir greater286 SHERAPTD OSBOE4N on the Exploratiora of abundance of animal and vevetable life than we have follnd to exist round the waterholes of Regents Inlet AVellington Channel or Lancaster Sound The possibility therefore of future explorers of Smith Sound being able to vary their dietary with the flesh of deer bear seal or wildfowl is an important recommendation to the route in question In this nleritlian too we find human life extending to a higher latitude thall in any other kllown direction A fine tribe of Arctic savaCes was fir3t discoveretl by Sir John Ross in lat 75 35 N lollt 65 32 w in his voage of 1818 Ross christened this isolated section of the great Esquimaux race Arctic High landers Through his interpreter Sackense he learnt that their tribe dwelt to the northward ot the great glacier of Melville Bay by it they were entirely cut of from all knowledge of anything in that direction and when Etss told them that his ship had come from the south they replied It was not true there was nothing but ice there  Subsequent Arctic expelitions as well as whale ships have had intercourse with these people and so far conciliated them that instead of offerinr to kill Europeans as they threatelled in 181S we find them in 1854 positively saving Kane and his fol lowers fIom starvation and cheerfully sharing food and loclgemelt with the poor sailors Of this isolated rroup of the human family Or Kane gives us a very interestint accourlt Having no boats nor a knowledge of how to construct theln out of bones anl 3ea skins as otller Esquimaux do afraid to cross the tWQ greatt ice streams of Aielville and of lIumboldt these poor creatures inhabit a region betweell the pronts of tie Greenland Glacier which embraces about 600 miles of coastline and they cannot penetrate far into the interior for there they sailX was the  Sernik Soak or Great Ice Atall  Without any driftwood except a fragment of wreck at rare intervals the Arctic Highlander is compelled to vlse bones alone in tlle construction of his sledffle and weapons rhe latter consist simply of knife harpoon and lance7 bones lashed together with all iron point or edge inteniously fitted hom fragments of meteoric iron found in the country or from scraps of ilon hoops which reach tlle const upon thc casks of wrecked whalers Withollt a bow or arrown they are unable to kill reindeer or muskoxen the former range unInolested over the barren 1lplands at the base of the glaciers and the art of fishinffl is likewise unknown for Kane saw lakes full of salmontrout which the Arctic IIigillanler could not catch Atith

consequently upon the existence of broken ice or open water near the coast throughout every season of the year Without it they would all perish in a single winter But a BeneXcent Providerlce has so arranged it that from the action of oceanic currerlts and the destruction of the icefields by the large icebergs thrown off froln the glaciers constantly sailing through them there is always even in the depth of a Polar winter some sc North Water  to be found and in it walrus and bear The land as I have said yields these Arctic fishermen no animal food neither can I discover an instance of their ever having been seen to partake of a single herb grass or berry grown upon the shore of vegetables or cereals they have of course no conception and I know of no other people on the earths surface who ale thus entirely carnivorous Kane says they must be an expiring race I can find no proof of it thugh no doubt like all savage races they are doomed to pass away or merge into those of a superior organisation Brhere Ross found the Arctic fIighlanders in 181S they exist in 1864 aIld from occasional contact with Europeans have rather improved than deteriorated All who have seen them and I am

nearerto the Pole than even where EXane found it in 80 N SO far as we know the Aretic Hithlanders are collfined to the Greenland shore and for our purposes of exploratioll it would be well it were so They would then be near erlough to aid as hunters and sledtedrivers and not so close as to endanCer good order and discipline amorlgst a crew in hours of trial or sufferinr rhere is one ulore reason

should be attenlpted I will rlow sketch out the mode in wllich it should be carried out for the details would be too technical anci volumillous to interest all geo graphers Arl exploratiorl of the

directed by the men of science in this courltry that I hope to see a Polar expedition sent forth in this generation under naval auspices The Navy needs some action to wake it up frorn the sloth of routine and save it from the canker of prolonged peace Arctic exploration is more wholesome for it in a moral as well as a sanitary point ot view than any more Ashantee or Japanese wars You are not

victorious battle and a wise ruler alld a wise people will I holl be careful to satisfy a craving which is the lifeblood of a professionindeed I hold that it ourht to be fostered and ellcouraffled Upon these grounds as well as those of scientific results would it be too much to ask for a fraction of the vast sum yearly sunk ill llaval expenditure for two small screwvessels and lSO officers and men out of the 500 men annually placed at the disposal of the Adrniralty  Let llS suppose it granted and two vessels like the Pioneer and Intreyid ready by the spring of 1866 They would sai for Baffin Bay reach Sape York in August and one vessel would be secured in or about Sape Isctbella leavint only twentyfive persons ill chtllge of her the other vessel with ninetyfive souls would be pressed up the AVestern shore either as far as Cape Parry or in that direction takirl care not to exceed a distance of 300 miles froln her consort That autumn the southern ship would connect herself by depots with the northern vessel and the northern vessel would place out depots towards the Pole ready for spring operations In l 86 7 and l868 sledce and boat orerations should be directed towards the pole and over the unknown area and in 1869 eitber ila ships or by boat to Upernavik our expedition would retire from Smith Sound They would thus ollly have two winters and three VOL XXXVI U290 SHERAPD OSBORN on the E8710ration of summers to encounter a period which experience has taught us healthy men with pioper care can well spend at a time in those regrorls Vith respect to dle distance to be traversed by sledge we have ample data to show that it has been exceeded by our sailors and marine3 in the most sterile land yet visited within the Frigid Zone For instance in 1853 Commander lMcClintocks party did 1220 geographical miles in 105 days Leutenant 3Techam did 1203 miles and Captain Richards and I did 1093 miles Mark that ail these distances are in excess of the 968 miles beteeil Cape Parry alld the Pole Lieutenant Hamilton did 1150 miles with a dotsledt antl one man Yet in subsequent expeditions to those of 1853 still lonner marches have been accomplished and the men sufTered still less In 1854 Mecham marched 1157 miles in only seventy days a gain of a month in tirne equal to a distanee of 30V luiles more had it beell necessury arll in 1859 Captaill tIcClintock actually accomplished 1330 luiles atld Young 1150 and that dis tillguished officer Sir Leopoll McClintock aSrees with me in thinkin that it is quite possible with prnper manatement to extend a journey over a distance of 1500 miles or just 500 miles more than are required to take a sledge from Cape Parry to the Pole and back Thanks to hardearned experience we habve learnt in ten years to double the periol a sledgeparty may support itself avway from the shipX and trebled the lerlgth of the journeys to be accomplished yet at the same time reduced the labour of the seamen and the personal risk to its mirliTnum I am not vail1 enough to suppose my unsupported opinio11 of the practicability and safety of a sledffleexploration of the Polar area would suffice to convince you all but I can confidently appeal to an officer of far greater experie1lve Captain Sir Leopold Mclintock lIe writint to me in lecember last says  I am glad you are pokinO up the erllbers of Arctic discovery I wish I were now preparing for a trip to the North Pole I retard it as beinr within the reach of this genelation for linowledge as you know as power ill sledCetravelling Can you doubt the practicability of such an exploration I say after such a declaratiorl fIozn an officer who has spent seven winters and ten summers in these eeas  I am sure you will not and that you will say with me that of all men he is the best fitted to head such an expedition 3rd Point Se have now to consider the final portion of nly argument rhe advantages to be derived from an exploration of   tne rolar area In the first place you as a scientifie bolly have before you an unknown area of 1131000 square miles of the glotes surface a sheer blank Within that area you are pl obundly gnorant whether there be lands or waters xvhether as some say it is athe North Polar ReyWon silent frozen solitude or an open sea teemint with animal life So far as you as yet have explored in that direction you have found the lanl capable of supporting not only animal but human life Moreover as connected Vith physical geographyX you have in 80 of North latitude reached the only kllown spot where Nature yields to man no plant herb or grass vfhich he uses for food or nutriment Yet imperfect as the botanical exploration of that spot has been we learn from the report of the able American botanist Mr Durand that althougll Dr Kane lost the maior p ortion of his collection the remainder  was yet the richest and most interesting ever brought by Arctic or Polar explorer  and Kane added no less than tuerltyseven species ot plants to the list recently published by that eminent Arctic naturalist Sir John Richardsoil as existing to the north of 73 of latitude Proving that at arly rate there was all error of 50 per cent in the botanical geography of the region ullder consideration To botanistsy therefore as well as geoOraphers there is everythinO to be discoverel within the Polar area and not only the botany of the land but that of the sea and of the fieshwater lake3 and rivers flowing from the glaciers of that icebound region Imme diately in coIlnection too with the distribution of the animal and vegetable kingdoms of tlle Polar Basin we have to solve more than one strange anomaly in the climate tllat has been noticed   upon lts margln The lowest known winter mean temperature has been recorded by Dr Kalle in the very regioll which is so rich in Arctic flora where the natives can support themselves alone upon the chase of marine creatures and whele the reindeer are so abuedant that a traveller subsequent to Kane shot 600 head anl supported his party upon fresh food throughout a long winter rLhere in Rensselaer Harbour with opell water not far to the south with open water as he believed not far to tlle north lsane records a winter mean temperature lower than we have found at Melvile Island where at that season we feel sure that there was no open sea llearer than the Mackenzie River or the entrance of Lancaster Soulld WIr Schott the able American meteol ologist puzzled with the anomaly of so low a temperature near the reportel open Polar Sea says that  it points conclusively to either a collsilerable northern extension of rinnell Land on the one side and an easterll extent of AVashington Land on the other or to a con silerable elevation of the interior on both sides of the channel above its level and acknowledges that his conclasions are at  Mr Cornelius Grinnell infolms me of this intetestillg fact conllected with Dr tIayes secoLd visit to Sulith Sounl U 2292 SHERARD OSBORN 07t the Explowation of variance with the supposed existence of an ocean around the Pole free for naviation The fact is that meteorology is quite as much at fault there as elsewhere when it proceeds to theorise upon insufficient data And in a scientSc point of view I maintain that nothing could be more deeply interesting than a careful series of meteorological observations within the Polar area Its climate is as I have shown a mystery and IVanes rouch observations require to be verified as urell as those of our searchinexpeditions by sending out a scientific expedition with people well versed and earnest in that science alone ln geoloUy and especialy in the phenomena of those stupendous glaciers as well aXs the great icestreams of Humboldt and of f58Ielville there is much to repay the future explorer of Smith Sound In the presence of men so eminently qualified to point out what is most deservinr of scientific investiation under tllese heads it would ill become me to do mlre than adsrert to the subject Indeed I feel I owe an aology to all men of science for even daring to touch upon subjects of which I as a sailor can have only the most fraUmentary knowledCre But I am also addressin myself to those who know little of such subjects and who may be carried axvay by the cuckoo cry of  ui bono   in discussing further geographical exploration The learned Council of this Society are not likely to 321y SO I know well or to ask me to demonstrate the necessity for further scientific research based upon an argument touching whaleoil mhalebone walrushidesS secllblubber narwhalivory deerskins peltrvX or Upernavik graphite I should as soon think of urffling the exploration of New Guinea upon the speculation of profits arisinffl frorn the tails of birdsofparadise or

to turn to the Royal Society and ask the learned Souncil whether tlere is anything likely to repay the explorer of the Pole for his labours  I can confidently appeal to its PresidentS General Sabine l1e is tolay the senior living officer of those ho accompanied Ross and Parry in their early exploratiolzs of the Arctic Zone In Spitz bergen llIelville Islanl and East Greenltlnd he collected those valuable data in terrestrial magrletism which have subsequently led to the collstruction of those beautiful charts exhibitiIg the declination inclination and intensity of tlle rnaglletic force over the globes surfacea wonderful reduction of scientific data to good 1lseful pllrposes which every saior can aIxpreciate arld be grateful for And does he tell us that there is nothing more to293 the North Polar Reyfon be done in the Arctic Zone  On the contrary in General Sabines Address to the Royal Society on November 30th 1863 he dvtTells especially on the pleasure with which he learns that the Swedish Goxrernment are about to carry out in Spitzbergen that measure ment of an arc of the merialian the value and importance of which the learned General had urgei forty years ago upon the attention of the British public and which he says  I had planned the rneans of esecuting and wllich I ardently desired to be permitted to carry out persorlally General Sabines original interestin paper upon the measure ment of this arc was addressed to Mr Gilbert WIP Vice President of the Royal Society in 1826 In it he pointed out the facility offiered by Spitzlergen for a measurement of an arc of the tneridian extendinC over nearly 42 degrees of latitude stating that the value of this measurelnellt in the latitude of Spitzbergen towards deducing the proportion of the polar and equatorial diameters by its combination with an arc near the eqllator  was most important  and addint that its value would be  equivalent to an arc in Lapland of six times the extent of the arc measured by the French Academicians Now the hope of the Royal Society OI this measurement being at last obtained depends UpOIl the scientific energy of the Swedish Government but it so happens that in the expedition I urge upon your attention there might be every arrantement made for a mea surement of four defflrees of the meridian upon the shores of Smith Sound I have told frou that one of the ships should be left abo1lt Cape Isabella and the other pusllcd on to Cape Parry or that that poink is to be considered our main station for a Polar expedition The interveninr space is rather more than four degrees and during the summer season whilst the Northern Expedition was absent there coulel be no more profitable way of occupying those left in the charte of the ships than in doing such a work as lnea suring an are the ice of the strait I would submit affording considerable facilities for stlch an undertakint and especial pro vision in the expelition might be made fUr such persons as were well qualified to execute it As late too as November 1864 we find General Sabine in his Address to the Royal Society calling the attention of that scientific body to some recent discoveries which attest the contiolua tion of the tropical Gulf Stream to the shores of Nova Zembla and to a eommunication from Professor Forchharrlmer of Copen haen a valuable contribution to a great subject the Eistory of the Seain which by careful alaalysis it is shown that in the Atlantic Ocean the saline ingredients in the seawater decrease with increasing depth This is found to hold good even to extreme depths alld the existence of a Polar current in the294 SHERARD OSBORN on the ESplo7att0n of depths of the Atlantic is hence inferred since it is a wellesta blished fact that the Fjquatorial seas are richer and the Polar seas poorer in saline inredients AgainS by analysis it has been proved that the current flvwing down the east coast of Greenland has all Equatorial and not a Polar origin a mere recurring of tlle Gulf Stream after rounding Spitzbergen and the learned President fairly argued lMar it not be possible that the iceless sea teeming with animal life described by IVane as viewed from the northern limit of his research is as he himself surmised but an extension of the salne Equatorial stream which produces cor respondint abnormal eflects at every point to which its course has been traced9 and adels  when physical researches shall be resumed within the cirele which surrounds the Pole this perhaps will be one of the earliest problems to receive solution7 In a recent letter to me

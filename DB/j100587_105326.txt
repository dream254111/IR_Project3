AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF A DISEASED EYE IN A LETTER TO MAT THEW MATY M D F R S BY DANIEL PETER LAYARD M D F R S DEAR SIR HUNTINGDON 20TH MAY 1758 IN OCTOBER 1755 I COMMUNICATED TO YOU AND YOU INSERTED IN THE LAST VO LUME OF YOUR JOURNAL BRITANNIQUE THE CASE OF SU SANNAH EARLE OF HEMMINGFORDGREY IN THIS COUNTY WHO IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE WHOOPING COUGH WAS AFFICTED WITH A PROTRUDED EYE THE CASE I NOW SEND YOU SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THAT YOUNG GIRLS IN ITS FIRST APPEARANCE AND PROGRESS BUT BY ACCIDENT ATTENDED WITH A SECOND DISEASE WILL PERHAPS DESERVE YOUR AT 5 C 2 TENTION READ NOV 9 1758748 TENTION AND NOT SEEM UNWORTHY OF BEING PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY JOHN LAW OF FENNYSTANTON ALSO IN THE COUNTY OF HUNTINGDON A STRONG AND ROBUST LAD THIRTEEN YEARS AND SIX MONTHS OLD IN EASTER WEEK 1756 BEATING DUNG ABOUT A CLOSE WITH UNUSUAL FORCE ON A SUDDEN FELT A VIOLENT PAIN IN HIS LEFT EYE THE PAIN INCREASED AN INFLAMMATION ENSUED AND THE EYE GREW DAILY LARGER THE POOR BOYS MOTHER FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS WHICH SHE RECEIVED WITHOUT THE LEAST BE NEFIT TO HER CHILD AFTER HAVING BESIDES OTHER EX PENCES BEEN DEFRAUDED BY A QUACK OF TWO GUINEAS A GREAT SUM FOR A POOR COTTAGER THE WIDOW LAW IN HER DISTRESS HEARD OF SU SANNAH EARLS CURE SHE WENT TO SEE HER AND DETER MINED TO BRING HER SON TO HUNTINGDON FOR MR HOP KINSS ASSISTANCE ACCORDINGLY OCTOBER THE 7TH 1756 SHE CAME TO MR DANIEL HOPKINS SURGEON IN THIS TOWN AND HAVING DESIRED MY OPINION WE BOTH EXAMINED THE EYE TOGETHER THE LEFT EYE WAS PROTRUDED OUT OF ITS ORBIT AND HUNG DOWN OVER THE CHEEK TO THE UPPER LIP THE COATS WERE GREATLY DISCOLOURED ALL THE VESSELS TURGID THE SIGHT TOTALLY LOST AND THE HUMOURS APPEARED LIKE FLUCTUATING PUS WE SAW THE NECESSITY OF AN IM MEDIATE EXTIRPATION TO SAVE THE RIGHT EYE ALREADY GREATLY INFLAMED AND HAVING APPRIZED THE MOTHER AND BOY OF THE STATE THE EYE WAS IN A CONSULTATION WAS DESIRED WITH TWO SURGEONS OF ST IVES MR DAWKES WHO WAS PRESENT WITH MR SKEELES AT SU SANNAH EARLES OPERATION BEING DEAD SINCE THAT TIME MR THOMAS SKEELES AND MR THOMAS WANT VERY CHARITABLY MET MR HOPKINS AND ME THE NEXT DAY OCTOBER THE 8TH AT THE WIDOW LAWS COTTAGE THE749 THE EYE APPEARED TO THESE GENTLEMEN AS I HAVE RELATED AND UPON MR WANTS PRESSING WITH HIS FIN GER ON THE PUPIL THE GLOBE BURST AT THE EDGE OF THE IRIS AND DISCHARGED PUS THE EXTIRPATION OF THE EYE WAS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED UPON AND IMMEDIATELY PERFORMED MR HOPKINS MADE A PUNCTURE WITH A LANCET CLOSE TO THE EXTERNAL AND SMALL CANTHUS OF THE EYE AND THEN WITH A PAIR OF CROOKED SCISSARS TOOK OFF ALL THE DISTENDED GLOBE CLOSE TO THE EYELIDS HE THEN CLEANED THE CAVITY OF THE PURULENT HUMOURS AND FILLED IT WITH SOFT LINT OVER WHICH HE APPLIED BOLSTERS DIPPED IN WARM RED WINE AND WATER AND THE MONO CULUS BANDAGE TO KEEP ON THE WHOLE DRESSINGS THE LAD WAS BLED IN THE ARM NITROUS MEDICINES AND ANO DYNES WERE PRESCRIBED AND A SUITABLE REGIMEN THE FEVER AND INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE GRADUALLY DE CREASED THE SUPPURATION OF THE WOUND IN FEW DAYS WAS GOOD THE DISTENDED EYELIDS CONTRACTED AND A CURE WAS SOON EXPECTED BUT ON NOVEMBER THE 7TH THE LAD WENT TO OPEN THE STREETDOOR AND IT BEING A COLD AND RAINY EVEN ING HE QUICKLY FELT THE BAD EFFECTS OF THE COLD WIND WHICH DROVE THE RAIN IN UPON HIM THAT NIGHT THE WOUND BECAME AGAIN VERY PAINFUL THE EYELIDS PUSSED UP AND NEXT DAY APPEARED MUCH INFLAMED AS WERE ALL THE CONTENTS OF THE ORBIT FUNGOUS EXCRESCENCES SOON FOLLOWED AND AN INTERMITTENT FEVER AN EMETIC BEING IMPROPER HE WAS PURGED WITH RHUBARB AND AFTERWARDS TOOK THE BARK INFUSED IN RED WINE THE FEVER WAS REMOVED AFTER SOME TIME BUT THE CONTENTS OF THE ORBIT CONTINUED INCREASING AND THE FUNGOUS EXCRESCENCES BECAME SO LARGE AND SPONGY AS TO BE OF EQUAL 8750 EQUAL BULK WITH THE DISEASED EYE BEFORE EXTIRPATION ALL TOPICAL APPLICATIONS TO CONTRACT THIS FUNGUS WERE INEFFECTUAL AND THE APPLICATION OF CAUSTICS OR ESCHAROTICS WAS PRUDENTLY AVOIDED LEST THEY SHOULD PRODUCE A CARCINOMATOUS ULCER THE DISCHARGE WAS CHIEFLY A PURULENT SERUM ON WHICH ACCOUNT EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER HE WAS KEPT UPON A DRY DIET IN FEBRUARY 1757 THE REMAINING COATS OF THE EYE BEGAN TO APPEAR AT THE MOST PROMINENT PARTS OF THE EXCRESCENCE AND SEEMED WHITE LIKE A PART OF THE CONJUNCTIVA ON TOUCHING IT WITH THE FINGER A DI STINCT FLUCTUATION WAS FELT AND AN HYDROPHTHALMIA PERFECTLY DISCOVERED BUT NEITHER THE THICKNESS OF THE COATS NOR THE SENSIBILITY OF THE PARTS WOULD PERMIT A PUNCTURE TO BE MADE TILL THE CYST WHICH APPEARED FORMED BY THE DISTENSION OF ONE OF THE COATS OF THE EYE WAS FREER FROM THE FUNGUS THE CYST CONTINUED DAILY TO EXTEND ITSELF AND TO SEPARATE THE FUNGOUS EDGES THE FLUCTUATION BECAME MORE MANIFEST AND THE MEMBRANES THINNER AT LENGTH ON THE 15TH OF JUNE 1757 MR HOPKINS OPENED THE CYST WITH THE POINT OF A LANCET AND LET OUT A LARGE CUPFULL OF LIMPID SERUM WITHOUT SMELL OR TASTE THE BOY FELT VERY LITTLE PAIN IN THIS OPERA TION THE CAVITY WAS FILLED WITH DRY LINT AND COM PRESSES DIPT IN WARM RED WINE AND WATER WERE APPLIED OVER IT ALL THE NIGHT FOLLOWING AND SEVERAL DAYS AFTER A GREAT DISCHARGE OF SERUM CAME AWAY ON THE 19TH THE FUNGUS WAS CONSIDERABLY LESSENED MR HOPKINS THEN DRESSED THE WOUND WITH WARM UN GUENTUM E GUMMI ELEMI AND WASHED THE FUNGUS WITH A LOTION OF AQUARUM CALCIS ROSARUM ET TINC TURAE751 TURAE MYRRHAE ON THE 23D UPON HIS REMOVING THE DRESSINGS HE SAW THE CYST LOOSE AND COLLAPSED WHICH HE EXTRACTED WITH HIS FORCEPS WITHOUT THE LEAST DIFFI CULTY OR PAIN TO HIS PATIENT THE FUNGUS DAILY WASTED AFTERWARDS THE WOUND DIGESTED WELL AND THE LAD WAS INTIRELY CURED ON THE 7TH OF AUGUST HIS RIGHT EYE IS PERFECTLY STRONG AND HE HAS BEEN FREE FROM COMPLAINT EVER SINCE THE REMAINDER OF THE COATS OF THE EYE AND OF THE MUSCLES BEAR UP THE EYELIDS THAT WHEN UNCOVERED HE ONLY SEEMS TO HAVE CLOSED THE LEFT EYE HOWEVER HE HAS WORE ALL THE WINTER A BACK PATCH OVER IT TO GUARD AGAINST FRESH COLD THE CYST WHEN FIRST TAKEN AWAY MEASURED THREE INCHES AND HALF IN LENGTH ONE INCH AND HALF IN DI AMETER AND CONTAINED A LARGE CUPFULL OF WATER IT APPEARED TO BE THE TUNICA SCLEROTICA WAS OF A CLEAR PELLUCID WHITE AND OF SO DELICATE A TEXTURE AS SCARCE TO ADMIT OF BEING TOUCHED WITHOUT TEARING AND WHEN DRIED WITH ALL POSSIBLE CARE BECAME SO BRITTLE THAT MR HOPKINS COULD HARDLY PRESERVE IT IN THE MANNER I NOW SEND IT R E M A R K S IN BOTH SUSANNAH EARLE AND JOHN LAWS CASES THE EYE WAS DISTENDED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF THE AQUEOUS HUMOUR SEPARATED IN GREAT QUANTITY BY THE REPEATED STRAINING OF THE BLOODVESSELS IN THE WHOOPING COUGH WHICH MIGHT GRADUALLY RELAX AND ENLARGE THE AQUEOUS DUCTS OF SUSANNAH EARLES EYE AND POSSIBLY BY THE RUPTURE OF THOSE DUCTS AND OF SOME BLOODVESSELS AT THE TIME JOHN LAW EXERTED HIMSELF VIOLENTLY IN BEAT ING752 ING DUNG ABOUT THE CLOSE FOR IN EITHER CASE THE IM PETUS OF THE BLOOD MUST HAVE BEEN SO VIOLENT AS TO PRODUCE THOSE EFFECTS HOWEVER FROM THE HYDROPH THALMIA SUCCEEDING THE OPERATION ON JOHN LAW THE FUNGOUS EXCRESCENCE AND CONTINUAL SEROUS DISCHARGE DURING SEVERAL MONTHS FROM THE WOUND IT PLAINLY APPEARS THAT AN ABUNDANCE OF AQUEOUS HUMOUR WAS DISCHARGED AT FIRST BY THE DISTENSION OR LACERATION OF THE AQUEOUS DUCTS AND LATTERLY FOR WANT OF A CON TRACTION OF THOSE VESSELS AND OF THE LYMPHATICS WHICH WERE NO LONGER OF USE BOTH THESE CASES SHEW THE NECESSITY OF INQUIRING PARTICULARLY INTO THE CAUSES OF DISEASES OF THE EYES AS WELL AS OF OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY FOR BY BARELY ATTENDING TO THE SYMPTOMS THE DISEASE WILL NOT BE REMOVED THO THE SYMPTOMS BE ALLEVIATED BLEEDING AND MODERATE EVACUATIONS WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE AT FIRST DECREASED THE TENSION AND PAIN AND ASSUAGED THE INFLAMMATION BUT BOTH TOPICAL APPLICATIONS AND INTERNAL MEDICINES WERE PROPERLY TO BE ADAPTED AND A SUITABLE DIET REGULATED NOT TO MENTION THE ABSURD AND IMPERTINENT ABUSE OF EMPIRICS WHAT BENEFIT COULD ACCRUE IN BOTH THESE CASES FROM UNCTUOUS LAXATIVE OR EMOLLIENT APPLICATIONS FROM DRASTIC AND MERCURIAL PURGES THO SUCH APPLICATIONS MIGHT BE WELL INTENDED TO TAKE OFF THE TENSION AND INFLAMMATION YET AS THE DISTENSION OF THE BLOODVESSELS ONLY INCREASED GRADUALLY AS THE GLOBE OF THE EYE WAS ENLARGED SO WHATEVER APPLICATION RELAXED THE COATS OF THE EYE MUST INFALLIBLY STRETCH OUT THE VESSELS YET FARTHER AND CAUSE A GREATER PAIN AND INFLAMMATION WHICH DRASTIC AND MERCURIAL PURGES WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE753 THE ONLY METHOD THEN TO BE PURSUED IN SUCH BAD CASES WOULD BE AT FIRST TO ENDEAVOUR TO REMOVE THE FULLNESS OF THE BLOOD AND MAKE USE OF SUCH TOPICAL REMEDIES AS WOULD CONTRACT WITHOUT IRRITATION IF THE CAUSE REMAINS AS THE WHOOPING COUGH IN SU SANNAH EARLES CASE NO AMENDMENT OF THE EYE CAN BE EXPECTED WHILE THE PATIENTS BLOODVESSELS ARE CON TINUALLY STRAINED BY FREQUENT COUGHING THIS ILLNESS THEREFORE SHOULD BE ATTENDED TO AND REMOVED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT SHOULD THE EYE BE SO ENLARGED AS TO PROTRUDE ITSELF OUT OF THE ORBIT THERE SEEMS NO OTHER WAY TO LESSEN THE BULK OF THE EYE THAN BY MAKING A PUNC TURE WITH A PROPER INSTRUMENT TO LET OUT THE AQUEOUS HUMOUR AND THEN APPLY SUCH AGGLUTINANT AND CON TRACTING COLLYRIA AS MAY REDUCE THE DISTENDED COATS AND VESSELS TO THEIR FORMER SIZE THIS OPERATION SHOULD BE PERFORMED BEFORE THE HUMOURS ARE VITIATED THE SIGHT LOST THE VESSELS IN A STATE OF SUPPURATION AND THE COATS OF THE EYE TOO FAR EXTENDED FOR AT THAT TIME NOTHING LESS THAN EXTIRPATION CAN BE OF USE PROFESSOR NUCK IN HIS TRACTATUS DE DUCTIBUS OCU LORUM AQUOSIS P 120  SEQ RELATES THE SUCCESS HE HAD IN CURING A YOUNG MAN BY FIVE REPEATED PUNC TURES AND A STRICT OBSERVANCE IN A PROPER USE OF ALL THE

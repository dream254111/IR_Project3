observations 4 That a man who puts his hand into your pocket a7nimofurandi is niot guilty of an attempt to steal if the pocket is empty savours more of casuistry than common sense Yet Reg v Collins 9 Cox C C 497 so decided The Court of Crown Cases Reserved is not  satisfied with this deci sion f8ueen vBrown 24 Q B Div 357 Probably no one is but Mr Bill Sykes  It may be suggested with great respect that the opinion of Mr Justice Barrett in People vMoran 2 contains arguments which lhave 4 satisfied  judges of some eminence and which do not appear to have been answered in any reported case THE Jurist of last November contains a remarkable account of a Swedish trial in which a medical student sued a doctor for hypno tizing him against his will The defendant was enterprising enough to follow up his previous offence by hypnotizing all the plaintiffs wit nesses and making them contradict themselves and behave in a generally irrational manner and this course of action so bewildered the judge that instead of committing the defendant for contempt a step which would seem to have been quite justifiable under the circumstances unless perhaps he feared to meet with the same fate as the witnesses lie adjourned the case for the purpose of calling in medical assistance The reader cannot buit fear that some of the picturesqueness of this anecdote is attributable to the fact that it comes by way of  one of the 1 VI 237 2 54 Hun 279 cited in 3 Harv L Rev 375NO TES 89 evening papers  yet it is impossible to read Dr Jamess interesting paper on the  Hidden Self  in the March  Scribners  without re flecting on the part which hypnotism may yet play in the law It is strange to think of our jury system and present judicial machinery applied to some of the many questions which the subject may raise more especially in the criminal law but up to the present time it does not seem to have come before the courts of this country In France however there have been such cases an account of which together with a very learned and valuable discussion of hyp notism in its legal aspects will be found in a recent work of M Jules Liegeois Professor of Jurisprudence at Nancy This book is an elabo rate treatment of the subject and contains facts of great importance to medical jurisprudence The author believes that there are serious dangers in hypnotism with which the law may be called upon to deal and he gives many striking experiments to show how the hypnotized person may be made the victim of fraud or crime or may by means of the posthypnotic suggestion be used as a tool in the hands of another2 In the latter case M Li geois is of opinion that the law should regard the hypnotizer as the criminal treating the subject as legally irresponsible Among the few occasions when the question has actually come up in court is a remarkable case some twentyfive years ago in which a beggar had enticed from her home under very peculiar circumstances the daughter of respectable French peasants He was arrested and the magistrate put to two doctors the question whether the accused  could by the influence of magnetic passes have destroyed her moral liberty to such an extent as to give his acts the character of rape The doc tors answered in the affirmative and at the trial which resulted in a conviction other experts were called and testified before the jury to the same effect M Lieogeois points out that the physicians seem to have imperfectly understood the nature of the  magnetism  of which they testified but that the circumstances of the case were such as entirely to confirm the theory that the prisoner exercised a hypnotic influence over his victim The facts of a more recent case where the memory of a girl convicted of theft was awakened by hypnotism and it was thus discovered that she had secreted the missing article while in a state of somnambulism bear a strange resemblance to the main incident of Wilkie Collinss  Moonstone In a note appended to the report of a recent criminal case on appeal in one of the Southern States State v Baker 0o S E Rep 639 the presiding judge takes occasion to protest against the pre vailing practice of incorporating into a bill of exceptions whenever the evidence is brought into question the stenographers report of the pro ceedings in the lower court It not only the judge claims renders the record vague and voluminous and involves the State and individ uals in much unnecessary expense but it also throws upon the judges 1 De la Suggestion et du Somnambulisme dans leurs Rapports avec la Jurisprudence et la

of such a use of the hypnotic suggestion is much overrated his views seem however to be connected with the pecu iiar doctrines of his school A treatise on Hypnotism by Dr Rj6rnstr6m of Stockholm recently translated for the Humboldt Library also contains a readable though rather thin chapter on Hypnotism and the Law90 HAR VARD LA W RE VIE W of the higher court a great deal of burdensome and needless labor That there is reason in the complaint will be admitted when the length of the report of this same case sent up in a bill of exceptions on the ground that the verdict was contrary to evidence is stated It covers eleven hundred and five large pages of print of which nine hundred and fifteen pages relate to the evidence and ninety to the examina tion of jurors all in the form of questions and answers With this volume before him it cannot be wondered that the judge complains The labor of fishing up the evidence in fragments from such muddy waters  as a Georgia judge terms it is no slight task and consumes much time badly needed for public business The judge urges that when the motion is for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is contrary to evidence the bill of exceptions should certify the facts proved and give the entire evidence He is undoubtedly right and the only wonder is that the judges confine themselves to complain ing when it would seem as if they had the remedy in their own hands A VIVID picture of society in Mississippi before the war is presented in a recent book by Mr Reuben Davis 1 the sole survivor of the bar of Mississippi of fifty years ago It was the Age of Chivalry and the prosaic rules of the common law were not allowed to interfere with the rules of honor The result is that many things in this book give our ideas of the majesty of the law a rude shock Murder seems to have been regarded as rather laudable than otherwise Mr Davis resigned his position of District Attorney to avoid prosecuting his friends for killing their fellowcitizens He defended over two hundred charged with murder no one of whom was hung Perhaps this spirit of leniency was fostered by the grand carousal in which the judge and jury participated which followed an acquittal but of course the great reason was that every one was expected to kill those with whom he quarrelled and none would vote to hang another for doing what he himself would have done under the same circumstances One marvels however that the district attorneys did not tire of indicting Even in the presence of the court the haughty Southerner could with difficulty curb his fiery spirit Mr Davis one of the most courteous refined and popular men in the State tried to cut the throat of a judge for whom he had the highest respect but whom he tholught had fined him unjustly In a case in which the passion of the spectators became aroused the position of the judge was precarious if his rulings dis pleased them We read that a certain ruling as to the admissibility of evidence was received with a storm of indignation by the spectators 4 Yells curses and even tears attested the fervor of their emotions The court saw its danger and hastily recalled the witness  We must be careful however not to assume that justice was administered after the frontier style Cases like the above were of course the rare excep tion All the technicalities of the commonlaw pleading were in full force  the law except in the case of homicide was effectively admin istered and we are assured that fraud and corruption of all kinds were detested 1 Recollectious of Mi5sissipPi and

government in whose province political questions lie there would seem to have been reason for the assumption that in such an exclusively political question as whether or not the country is still at war the Supreme Court would be reluctant to interfere with the legislative and executive decision The 1 Luther v Border 7 How U S i i849586 HARVARD LAW REVIEW dissent of four justices in a case upholding the constitutionality of the Volstead Act2 comes as a somewhat staggering blow to what was thought a basic conception of our governmental system The upholding of the WarTime Prohibition Act 3 seemed only a well advertised illustration of the divisionofpowers principle It seemed quite clear that Congress did not overstep the boundaries of its discretion when it decided that the declaration of an armistice did not mean that the war emergency was over and that preventing the grain of the country from being made into liquor was one way of meeting that emergency But the court conceded for the purposes of the case that the continued validity of the act might depend upon whether or not it appeared to the court that its necessity still existed The meaning of that concession became evident when three of the four dissenting justices in Ruppert v CacJey4 based their dissent on the ground that in their opinion when the act was passed the necessity had ended Other questions raised in that case present no difficulty A state statute providing for prohibition without compensation has been up held on the ground that the restriction of use is not a taking of property 5 the restriction in the Volstead Act moreover was not permanent for at the time of the passage of the act there was nothing to show that the war would not end and demobilization be completed before the Eighteenth Amendment took effect Mr Justice Brandeis shows that eighteen states have enacted that a malt beverage containing one half of one per cent alcohol is intoxicating as a matter of law state legislation prohibiting the sale of a beverage which may be innocuous in itself has been upheld6 and apart from the constitutionality of national prohibition certainly the court could not say that a method of achieving prohibition reasonable for a state is unreasonable for the nation As for the constitutionality of national prohibition itself the court was unanimous in upholding the WarTime Prohibition Act the least the HIamilton case 7can stand for is that if the war emergency exists prohibition is a constitutional way of meeting it The real issue in Ruppert v Caffey then is clear  is it for the court to decide whether or not the war emergency has passed 8 2 Ruppert v Caffey U S Sup Ct No 603 October Term i919 The armistice with Germany was signed on November ii i9i8 The WarTime Prohibition Act providing that after June 30 i9i8 until the conclusion of the war and the termination of mobilization the date to be proclaimed by the President it should be unlawful to sell for beverage purposes any distilled spirits was approved on November 2l i9i8 The Volstead Act providing that the WarTime Prohibition Act should include any liquors containing in excess of onehalf of one per cent alcohol was enacted on October 28 i919 over the Presidents veto 3Hamilton v Kentucky Distilleries and Warehouse Co Dryfoos v Edwards U S Sup Ct Nos 589 and 602 October Term i9i9 4 Supra note 2 5 Mugler v Kansas 1 23 U S 623 1887 The court in constg the Fourteenth Amendment has often referred to cases under the Fifth Mr Justice Brandeis in his opinion in the Hamilton case inverts the process 6 Purity Extract Co v Lynch 226 U S 192 1912 7 Supra note 3 8 Mr Justice McReynolds in his dissenting opinion says The power of Congress recognized in Hamilton Collector etc    should be restricted to actual necessities consequent upon war    Whether these essentials existed when a measure was enacted or challenge presents a question for the courtsNOTES 587 Of all questions of fact it would seem that this is peculiarly appropriate for Congress and peculiarly inappropriate for the court9 Mr Justice McReynolds in his dissenting opinion attempts to draw a distinction between the scope to be allowed Congress in the exercise of an express power and that to be allowed it in the exercise of an implied power That attempted distinction Mr Justice Brandeis effectively explodes In the first place it is hard to see why the power to pass acts for the carrying on of war is not expressly given to Congress10 in the second assuming the power is only implied the question of whether the power is there because the Constitution says it exists or because the court says the Constitution must mean that it exists is only a preliminary one given the existence of the power the court has only one standard for deciding how far it goes Whether peace has come is not a question of fact but a question of expediency not a fact but the way facts should be met is involved With our troops in Siberia and on the Rhine with the economic life of the country and of the world still profoundly disorganized the situation at the time Ruppert v Cafey was decided shows the wisdom of making the absence of Presidential proclamation or Congressional resolution conclusive But the significance of the dissent in Ruppert v Cafey is much more startling By the narrow margin of a single vote the court has repudiated a doctrine which applied might make an error of the justices in prophesying the outcome of an armistice result in irrep arable disaster In Martin v Mott I2 Wheat U S ig i827 it was held that under an act of Congress passed under its constitutional power to provide for the calling forth of the militia giving the President power to call forth the militia in an emergency not only was the action of the President in calling it out not reviewable but the avowry was not defective in not stating that the emergency existed 10 The Congress shall have power to declare war    to raise and support armies   to provide and maintain a navy    and to make all laws which shall be neces sary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers Art I Section 8 of the Constitution

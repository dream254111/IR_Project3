following papers were read On the Pebbles at Harwich Cape Cod Mass and on Rude Arrowheads found among them Dr ALEXIS A JULIEN Along the south shore of the apronplain at Harwich the glacial deposits show abundant sections of layers of gravel often coarse and at one point huge angular boulders up to eight feet in diameter similar to those in the moraine along the north side of the cape The pebbles consist almost altogether of crys talline rocks in considerable variety in which however three types predominate The prin cipal one is a coarse binary granite sometimes porphyroidal passing by addition of horn blende into monzonite Its sheared form seems to be represented by pebbles of granite gneiss or apliteschist without mica and very rarely of a fine biotite gneiss This rock appears to have been cut by intru sive dikes both of an acid rock and of another of intermediate character occurring in abun dant pebbles The one is a pinkish quartz porphyry a white felsite or finely striped rhyolite whose sheared form appears to be a white phyllitic gneiss with minute augen structure The other a rather finely granular gabbro made up of white feldspar and a greenish black hornblendelike mineral This rock by shearing has passed into a hard green stone often decidedly schistose and perhaps into a banded schist Besides these three types several varieties of fine crystalline schists probably metamorphic rarely small grains of serpentine and occasional flakes of blueblack argillite A marked feature in all these rocks is the almost entire absence of mica of any kind and that mineral does not occur even in the sands and clays at least in scales visible to the naked eye By contrast the characteristic rocks of the adjoining coast along the mainland of eastern New England have not been found in spite of constant search e g the micagneisses and micapegmatites north of New Bedford the granite of Quincy Mass the Dorchester con glomerate the pyroxenic rocks and basic mica diorites of Nahant the porphyritic biotite granites of the Maine coast etc The con clusion is that the pebbles at iarwich have been transported from some other micaless region Among the pebbles in ploughed fields many rude stone implements may be found such as tomahawks scrapers lanceheads and particu larly arrowheads of the simplest form prob ably left by Indians of the Massaquoit tribe of whom several small kitchenmiddens have been found in the neighborhood These tools have been made from the local materials above described chiefly from pebbles of the harder and finer schists rhyolite quartzporphyry and often granite Their dull edges and rounded points may imply that in many cases they have never been sharpened but used for stunning birds and small animals Many832 SCIENCE N S VOL XXVI No 676 show mere traces of human workmanship per haps but one or two artificial faces as if their owners had been content to use the simplest flakes for arrowpoints The Sylvania SandstoneA Study in Pale ography Dr A W GRABAU The speaker described field work carried on in company with Professor Sherzer in south ern Michigan for the state survey The spe cial object of study was the Upper Monroe formation and the Sylvania sandstone The evidences of the eolian anemoclastic origin of this rock were presented An interesting new fauna of late Siluric age and with De vonic affinities was found in the higher beds Evidence of the disconformable relation of the Monroe and the overlying Dundee Onon daga was obtained After discussion of both papers the mem bers of the section contributed observations made during the summer Professor J F Kemp stated the general results of study of the petrography of the Adirondack region and Dr E 0 Hovey gave an account of ex cursions of Section E of the American Asso ciation for the Advancement of Science in the vicinity of the Adirondacks Professor C P Berkey reviewed his recent investigations in the Highlands of New York the difficulty of correlation of the Manhattan schists on the south with the Cambrian sedimentaries on the north but reported the passage of the latter into crystalline condition eastward toward the Connecticut line ALEXIS A JULIEN Secretary THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY THE one hundred and thirtyfifth regular meeting of the society was held at Columbia University on Saturday October 26 a single morning session sufficing for the usually brief program The attendance included twenty eight members Vicepresident P F Smith occupied the chair The council announced the election of the following persons to

Science The annual meet ing of the Southwestern Section was held at St Louis on November 30 F N COLE Secretary THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON THERE was presented at the meeting of November 5 1907 a report on Recent Ex plorations and Excavations in Colorado Utah and New Mexico by Edgar L Hewett di rector of American archeology for the Arche ological Institute of America The paper was illustrated with lantern slides Professor Hewett was able with the aid of volunteer students to carry on an extensive reconnois sance of ruins on the San Juan River in Utah and Colorado and interesting views wereDECEMBER 13 1907 SCIENCE 833 shown of this work in Mesa Verde Park McElmo Canyon Monument Park and Grand Gulch the latter containing several hundred cliffdwellings of the Basket Makers The work in New Mexico was concentrated on a large ruin in the Puye where 120 rooms were cleared out and a collection secured numbering 3500 artifacts The paper was discussed by the president Dr llrdlicka and Mr Robin son WALTER HOUGH General Secretary

j100066,The American Journal of Psychology,1411498,A Sketch of the History of Reflex Action I Introductory,i261576,A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF REFLEX ACTION I INTRODUCTORY A number of the phenomena normal and especially morbid which we now group under the physiological category of reflex action are noted in the earliest medical literature The Hippokratic writers not only knew of a general consensus between different parts of the bodysuch as that existing between the uterus and the breastsbut in their sections on the sacred disease or madness it is easy to see that various forms of reflex cramps although wrongly understood had been often observed Galen even describes correctly the effect upon the aperture of the pupil of closing and illuminating the eye and treats of diseases and abnormal symptoms which arise from sym pathy The history of medical studies before the great anatomists of the sixteenth century had demonstrated the existence of nerves as distinct from sinews records many instances of sympathy7 mediated it was often said by the bloodvessels Some of these are purely fanciful some are due to other causes but not a few are true reflexes It is impossible to approach our subject without asking at the outset why the simple rubric of reflexion which now explains so much was not suggested by the phenomena so often observed before the second quarter of our own century The answer is not however far to seek Besides the meagreness of anatomical knowledge there was a deeper and more generic cause suggested by the very word sympathy  It was the belief in an immaterial psychic principle pervading the whole body and mediating freely between its parts without necessi tating a direct connection of tissues This general notion which long prevented any adequate conception of reflex movements and which as we shall see later is still cherished by a few uncritical scientific men is no less universal and spontaneous than language itself in the earliest known forms of which it is so manifoldly seen It is nothing more nor less than spirit ualism or animism beginning as it naturally does in the form of psychological dualism at first with the suggestion of a refined essence intangible as a shadow separable from the body in dreams vital as the breath finally surviving death and endowing animals plants inorganic things and even theREFLEX ACTION elements of the world itself with a distinct animating if not a free and more or less conscious principle The supposed subtle operations of this principle have been often character ized It will answer our purpose here merely to recall to mind a few not unfamiliar historical motifs which we wish might serve to broaden the narrow and conventional lines wrongly followed in the socalled  history of philosophy In the rudimentary physiology and pathology of nearly all the Greek philosophers the pneuma or psyche plays the chief role Plato the great protagonist of all modern animistic philosophizing conceived the soul as at the same time the principle of life and as independent of the body It thought in the head felt in the breast and desired in the belly It was closely connected with the worldsoul while over the material world the idea reigned supreme Aristotle who may be said to have given form to the mediaeval Christian philosophy and especially to its psychology as well as to have first taught the development theory and the doctrine of the powers or faculties of the soul recognized a nutritive soul in plants a sensory soul in animals and a thinking soul in man As the principle of life it was inseparable from the body while the thinking nous was immortal It was the sufficient cause of all the phenomena of life Its chief seat was the heart and it was mediated by fire air or ether The Stoics the pneumatic school of medicine and even Galen believed the body pervaded through all its faculties by vital or intelligent forces The cabalistic systems of emanation which so effectually extin guished medical knowledge and art after Galen taught that demons once united near God fell and now pervade all nature giving it harmony as the human body is pervaded by sympathies7 Diseases especially those of the nervous system were ascribed to the presence of devils The physi cian must not so much study magic which was suspected as science came to be later but must struggle up by prayer asceticism and extasy to gain the theurgic power of exorcism by knowledge of and living union with the omnipotent sper matic Word of God Meanwhile devastating plagues and fantastic neural diseaseslycantrophy obsession dancing and selfscourging manias and the childrens crusade which Haeser in his history of epidemic diseases well describes as a psychic pest were explained on this principle Cardanus taught that there was a sympathy between certain parts of the body and certain planets Paracelsus whose vagaries overthrew the authority of Galen asserted that the soul itself had a soul and that had another and so on to the fifth potence or the quintessence He taught the existence of a sidereal and an astral as well as a material body and 72REFLEX ACTION assumed a conscious vegetative principle or archceus which separated the good and the bad in food fed the various organs and kept them at work and must occasionally be roused by medicine or otherwise from forgetfulness of its duties According to the Rosicrucians medicine rests on a knowledge of universal harmony Plants suffer our diseases and all diseases have their real seat not in the material organism but in an animating principle Thus the sympathy of medicines of which they wrote was no mere metaphor to their minds Not only was the existence of a panacea as the counterpart of poisons universally deadly asserted but it was assumed that all diseases had at bottom one occult imma terial cause and must also have one cure which was to be spiritually sought discerned and applied Thus medicine was connected with Christology Croll asserted that all nature was alive and nothing was dead Man is made after the pattern of the firmament All that exists in the world at largeeven minerals and plantsexists also in microcosmic man Every herb represents a star and every star an herb and the doctor who is regenerate by the light of divine grace knows the magnetic starlent influences by which all medicines work and the mysterious signatures in accordance with which they must be applied Later it was said that every organ had its vital part We even read of a vital astronomy and all nature was animated by sympathies and antipathies As Geulincx declared that mind and body were so distinct and opposed that they could affect each other only through a divine mediation so Helmont taught that no medicine could take effect save through the gracious compassion of God Disease it was repeatedly urged was not merely an accident or a substance but a struggle of the vital forces against the invasion of a morbid species or principle Near the end of the seventeenth century many of these conceptions were com bined in the influential theory of Stahl that the soul must be assumed as the one only immaterial and active principle in the body the latter as material being absolutely passive Every physiological process and movement whatever is the work of this rational and intelligent although not always conscious or reflective soul Fever e g Stahl regarded as the excreting secreting circulatory processes of a sound soul resisting some noxious agent or activity and as impossible in animals because they have no soul The influence of such conceptions has fortunately enough for the human race ceased for the most part to influence the theory or the legitimate practice of medicine although they are common and potent enough among uneducated and quack ish physicians In the natural philosophy of Schelling and 73REFLEX ACTION Oken the spiritualistic conception obtained a very strong hold of the popular halfcultured mind which it still fascinates in the form of Hartmanns exposition of the Unconscious in Haeckels speculations about the cellsoul etc Here too as we shall explain later we believe the theories of Whytt and Pfliiger and their rehabilitation by G H Lewes must event ually be classed That chapter of it which treats of nervous functions has been longest and most dismally obscured by the same class of superstitions which science has had to oppose in some form at every step of its progress It is plain that if corporal functions are mediated by immaterial agencies phy siological science is impossible If between a stimulus and the reactionary movement in the leg of a freshly decapitated frog any sort of a sensory or volitional process is interpolated which is different from or can in the least degree affect the train of mechanical or chemical activities in the tissues it follows that just in that degree all inferred laws concerning the action of reflex centers can be only conjectured as far as their more broadly philosophical bearings are concerned These spiritualistic superstitions were indeed opposed not merely to the principles and methods of science in general but were eminently inconsistent with such fundamental schematisms as sensation and motion feeling and will stimu lus and reaction etc the slow development of which by the Montpelier school and elsewhere gradually paved the way for a neuropsychology which came to regard reflex action as the element rudiment type or unit of mind Again it was frequently said that sympathies were medi ated by the blood vessels This seems like at least an attempt at a physiological explanation This doctrine was however closely connected with early spiritualistic conceptions on the one hand and with an erroneous conception almost universally held in some form for nearly a score of centuries on the other In the first place in dead animals the arteries being found nearly empty were thought by the ancients to be filled from the lungs with air or ether as their name indicates Ether accord ing to the extended and influential Pythagorean school was the highest and purest part of the air the medium in which gods planets and immortal souls live serenely in eternal motion Demokritus taught that the psychic nature was inhaled constantly from the air The soul of man was thus called a product or part of the worldsoul Diogenes made air the first element and said that life and thought were given in or with it The Hippokratic school explained further that after reaching the arteries the ether passed to the brain where it left the bloom of its forces increasing sensibility and mobility and thence flowed to other parts of 74REFLEX ACTION the body which are vital in proportion to the nearness of their vascular relation to the brain By a curious confusion of the two standpoints the brain and not the heart or diaphragm as many supposed was made the seat of feeling and knowledge while at the same time it was regarded as a gland that cooled and tempered the heat of the heart by secreting phlegm which if its passage downward and outward was checked caused epileptic cramps tetanus spasmus cynicus madness and a disease which seems to have been tabes dorsualis Hence it was inferred that such diseases which have played so important a part in the early history of religion were no more holy than others need no expiation and are cured not by magic but like all diseases by applying the counter cause Hence too the great influence ascribed to winds weather and the location and frontage of houses to which so much space is devoted by this school in a fashion so eminently sanitary and in accordance with the customs and climatology of Greece and which can be traced in astrological vagaries that haunted therapeutics for many centuries The powers of the air the rushing wind or spiritus the higher pneumatic nature of man concentric airy spheres peopled with more and more heavenly natures as the soul ascends and many other widely current conceptions of primitive psychology show how deeply inwrought was the notion of an airy etherial soul per vading the whole body no less effectually than the bloodgasses in the processes sometimes grouped together by modern physi ology as internal breathing Plato thought taste was medi ated by small bloodvessels which pass from the tongue to the heart and hearing by the motion of the air being carried over into the blood While the brain was spongy moist and the seat of cold which tended downward the heart was the source of heat and fire which tended upward to prevent the too lavish efflux of which the eyelids were designed From the notion of the sacredness of blood as a medium of the soul came the subtleties of the pulsefeelers who distinguished a score of fantastic kinds of pulse from which they practiced divination as was later done with the urine of which nineteen colors were distinguished as well as the sixty species of fevers described in the fifteenth century Again sympathies were mediated not by the blood directly but by animal spirits secreted from it in the ventricles of the brain the systole and diastole of which caused them to circu late along the nerves through the body One mediaeval anatomist describes the optic nerve as having the form of a hollow tube so that the visual spirits might pass carrying the ideas from the air and idola from objects to the brain Such conceptions gathered almost at random will suffice to 75REFLEX ACTION illustrate the general psychophysic notions which prevailed until Harvey in the first half of the seventeenth century demonstrated the circulation of the blood and which for a long time prevented the acceptation of his theory Even when he urged that in the embryo at least blood and not ether must circulate in the arteries it was replied that one as well as the other could be derived from the mother It was far easier one antagonist urged to conceive fine meshes in the walls of the heart perhaps closed after death through which air entered from the lungs than to imagine the fine invisible capillaries which Harvey assumed all over the body connect ing arteries and veins Toward the end of the sixteenth century before Harvey had made his observations the opinion began to gain ground among anatomists that the sympathies were mediated by the nerves which were beginning to attract great attention This was in some sense established by Willis who was the best anatomist of the seventeenth century Where two parts of the body were in sympathy he inferred that they were con nected by nerves instead of by bloodvessels This opinion was current for a long time A glance at the neurology of this period will suffice to show that although much was done by the great observers whose names are preserved in the nomen clature of the brain they were very far from attaining to any adequate conception of the functions of a nervous center or even of nervous fibres But a few decades before Willis wrote one observer had urged with great vigor the Aristotel ian theory that the nerves took their rise from the heart because the soul being one could have but one seat and that must be the heart which was the first point of motion in the impregnated egg and was immediately affected by every emotion The arteries which conducted nervous energy from the heart to the brain had a nervous envelope and after their cavities had united in the brain their walls divided as nervous threads Although the animal spirits were secreted from the blood of the choroid plexi Servetus said the proper seat of the soul was the aqueduct of Sylvius The first and second ventricles he explained received images from the external world the third was the seat of thought and the fourth of memory The cortex and convolutions of the brain were neglected the base and centre attracting chief attention in spite of the old notion that the outer membrane enclosing it in which it was long thought the cerebral nerves in part took their origin was essential to psychic processes When Fallo pio urged that only the optic nerve was enclosed by a mem brane of the dura mater it was for a time thought that this 76REFLEX ACTION was a peculiarity of sensory as distinct from motor nerves Long and sometimes bitter was the controversy whether the optic nerve was really hollow that the visual spirits might reach the eye whether the brain had more veins than arteries whether it was a gland and the glands nervous whether nerves contracted and relaxed whether the cerebellum had nerves of its own and at what point the soul was most probably located The corpora striata according to Willis was the seat of sensation while the activity of the soul was chiefly concentrated in the corpus collosum on the surface of which ideas were mirrored as on a white wall A whitish nervous sap is the vehicle of the animal spirits Others influenced by Newtons discoveries argued for a solidary structure of the nerves and the theory of nervevibration analogous to the undulations of ether was generally adopted by English physiologists On the one hand it was urged that the vessels about the circle of Willis were the centre of sensation and the dura mater was that of motion while in Italy it was thought that the latter enclosed four ventricles like the heart and was the centre from which nerves proceeded like the bloodvessels from the heart and finally that it was loose enough to beat like the heart as its analogous fibrous structure indicated Thus all the movements in the body which were effected by nerves were ultimately caused by the force imparted to them from the dura mater the movement of which aided the circulation in the brain secreted the nerve juice and diffused it throughout the nervous system and the extreme sensitiveness of which indicated that it was the seat of all sensation It was reserved for Haller to demonstrate that the dura mater was immovable insensitive and was not the origin of nerves Thus sympathy or consent although rightly located in the nervous system was not much nearer a correct explanation than when it was thought to be mediated spiritually or through the bloodvessels A fourth theory more important for our theme took its origin in the epochmaking discovery of the father of German physiology Haller which properly dated with his communi cation to the Gottengen Academy in 1752 He had tested a great number of tissues and organs and found that the irrita tion of some caused sensation and that of others caused movement or contraction Only those parts which contained muscular fibres could contract while nerves were not irritable because they could not move He found that muscles were irritable some time after they were separated from the body and compared the contraction of the fibers of the heart caused by the blood with that of the voluntary muscles caused by the will Irritability he found constantly present in the 77REFLEX ACTION muscles while nervous force worked through the will the result being the same in both cases Hitherto every force tolerated in the animal body had been either closely analogous with known chemical or mechanical forces or else had been regarded as more or less spiritual Haller analyzed the hitherto inexplicable functions of motion and found an elementary power inherent in muscular fibres which was always present and aroused by irritation and which had no parallel in inorganic nature Haller was moderate and rational and regarded irritability only as a power peculiar to and inherent in muscular fibres The long discussion of his dis covery that followed and which for a time eclipsed nearly every other question in medical science equals if it does not exceed in vagaries the philosophical speculation consciously and unconsciously suggested or fashioned upon the demonstra tion of magnetism and electric polarity Whytt declared that all parts of the animal body were sensitive whether containing nerves or not and that the socalled irritability was a psychic activity Some feared a rehabilitation of occult qualities in the doctrine of irritability Some thought that all muscular action depended on nervous fluid or the vis nervosa One writer said that only nerves could excite the vital molecular activity of contraction and not a few argued that diseases were caused by means of medicines working upon irritability Irritation and stimulus henceforth became dominant concep tions in pathology Gaub distinguished the soul to which he ascribed not only the instincts but even respiration and vital force and defined the latter as the power by which living matter con tracted under the influence of irritation Living matter is matter that can contract and feel and an irritation he explains as that which by contact excites vital force to action In his Pathology however he uses the word irrita bility in quite a different sense as increased activity of the vital force and as such opposed to torpor Vital force he argued was something unique and not to be sought in the elements of organisms for these could still subsist when it was gone It was not even to be confused with the electric or nervous fluids which two latter some identified Barthey added to irritability in muscles a dilatationforce and regarded their rest as active Gregory thought irritability was to be distinguished from nervous force only by its seat and besides a dead elastic force in muscular fibre described a third  tonic force which resisted their relaxation Schafer regarded sensibility as independent of its material basis and essentially identicalwith vital force while irritability depended upon it Some located irritability in the solid others in 78REFLEX ACTION fluid parts of the body Many said everything which can react is irritable thus extending the notion to the whole body while scores of speculations for which we have no space and the reader would have no patience were freely indulged in Hallers conception of irritability rested upon the phenom ena observed in the heart which he supposed to be without nerves This error was natural enough when we consider that the nerves of the heart are so small that only the most accomplished microscopists can trace them Only one observer seems rightly to have understood and to have effectively contributed to the development of Hallers conception of irritability Fontana in his classical experiments published in 1775 demonstrated the difference between irritability and elasticity which continued its oscilations after the cause was removed on the one hand and the vis nervosa on the other He showed that every stimulus diminished while rest increased irritability He agreed with Haller that the nerv ous agent was the exciting but not the immediate and sufficient cause that in most cases it acted as the external excitor of the irritability of the muscular fibre By the discoveries of Galvani near the beginning of the present century attention was called to the phenomena of nerves acting under electrical stimulation and the important question whether muscles were irritable without the mediation of nervous fibres was demonstrated after the effect of curara which destroys the action of nerves upon muscles was dis covered independently and about the same time by Kolliker and Claude Bernard This we may regard as a triumphant vindication of Haller whose work resulted in exorcising from musclesthe last excited element in the reflex arc the mystic notions of vital force and in opening up the broad and fruitful field of myology to scientific methods Although Haller had found that certain parts such as the pleura the bronchi etc responded to stimulation neither by sensation nor motion another important result of his experi ments was to cause functions and parts to fall into two great categories one sensory and the other motor This important dichotomy which still underlies most conceptions of reflex action also began at once to play an exceedingly conspicuous part in medical and philosophical theories The notion of vital force was in fact as some complained divided into two principles Sensibility was paralleled or contrasted with irritability at every point The mystics and followers of Stahl substituted motility or perhaps like Borden voluntary motion as the second term of the two elementary physiological phenomena Many translated irritability in the freest and loosest way as the power of reacting upon outer impressions of 79REFLEX ACTION all sorts Even subjective phenomena such as pain reflexion etc were characterized as higher manifestations of irritability In the system of John Brown which became so influential on the continent excitability was said to be located in nerve and muscle substance and was defined as the property of being called into selfactivity by the action of external stimuli and was made the specific though otherwise unknown character istic of living matter The latter tends at every point and movement to fall into its simpler elements but is forced to continue the processes which constitute vitality by external activities ever incident upon it in all directions Too much of the latter causes hypersthenic too little the asthenic diseases Life is thus reaction and all its processes are made up of stimuli excitability and excitement The only physiological fact upon which this class of specu lations rested was the observation that the stimulation of certain nerves seemed to cause only sensation and that of others only motion The discovery of the Voltaic pile with its negative and positive pole was immediately seized upon with the greatest avidity and became the fundamental category now in more now in less disguised or conscious form for a mass of medical and philosophical speculation Life it was said was analo gous to if not identical with electricity and the intellectual world seemed to fall apart into the quaint electric dualisms of active and passive male and female day and night thought and feeling acid and alkali etc etc Many preferred to regard the universe as made up of triads Oxygen hydrogen and carbon were often suggested but under the influence of Blumenbach and especially of Schelling the triad reproduc tion irritability sensibility as ascending potencies of the abso lute revealed successively in the ascending orders of animal life gradually unfolded into speculative forms which Humboldt well designated as the saturnalia of natural science Hegel is preeminently indebted to Volta for his unique dialectic method of affirmation or position negation and mediation or indifferencepoint Meanwhile medical art and science grad ually decayed in Germany until in 183040 they were by general consent in worse condition here than in any enlightened country in Europe while animal magnetism cra nioscopy and homceopathic vagaries sprung up grew rank and struck deep root in soil in which if anywhere only minute and painstaking investigations of the physical conditions of health and disease should be cultivated Only for the funda mental dichotomy of sensation and motion was solid physio logical ground won later by the great discovery of Charles Bell that the posterior spinal nerves were sensory and the anterior nerves motor 80REFLEX ACTION It will help us to understand another element of the greatest importance for our theme to go back to the seventeenth cen tury and to remember that as Plato is the philosophic father of most spiritualistic tones of thought so Des Cartes may be said in general terms to have introduced into the modern world that form of dualism which has superseded Platonism and proposed the fundamental problem with which philosophy has been so largely occupied ever since viz the mediation between mind and matter soul and body thought and being We will not here pause to trace out the repressing effect which the metaphysical theories which centre about the theory of knowledge have had upon legitimate psychological studies It is important however not to forget that Des Cartes was led chiefly by the exigencies of his systemaccording to which mind as thought could have nothing in common with matter as extension and must therefore be brought into a forced union with itand partly by his physicomathematical tastes and studies to describe the body as a machine and that this characterization had great influence upon minds of an empirical order Great and preponderating as were the powers he assigned to the soul the limitation of its seat to a single part and the relegation to it of only those activities within the body not strictly mechanical was a step of great importance Besides this Des Cartes whole habit of mind his inability to think save with visual and mathematical concepts his physical conception of physiology and the form and nature of particles were no doubt of much direct and indirect influence in form ing the mechanical or socalled iatromathematical school of medicine A more direct stimulus to this school was given by the brilliant demonstrations of Galileo while Harvey Bacon the revival of fine arts in Italy and the unfruitfulness of chemicalhumoral conceptions expressed and strengthened the tendency it represents The modern mechanical school of physiology was founded by Borelli whose chief work on The Motion of Animals appeared in 1670 The bones he described as levers and the swelling of muscles by the nervous fluid propelled into them from the brain was the motive power He estimated how much force is lost by the unfavorable purchase of muscles and compared the force used by different muscles He first demonstrated that the act of breathing was a process in which the lungs are purely passive and analyzed composite motions with a thoroughness unsurpassed till Weber The movement of the blood he referred to static and hydraulic principles tried to estimate the force of the hearts movements and knew that it was greatest in the lateral walls while the apex was comparatively motionless Even digestion he inferred from 6 81REFLEX ACTION the stomach of birds consisted largely of detrition while he calculated in pounds the powers of the walls of the stomach Secretion he considered as a process of sifting depending on the different diameter of small vessels Borellis pupils like their master restricted themselves to the most familiar natural forces and mechanical principles in their attempts to explain organic processes Hoffman who also studied mathe matics as a preparation for medicine in establishing this school in Germany added to the ordinary material elements the hypothetical ether which Huyghens had just introduced Besides permeating the blood ether has its own peculiar circulation through the nerves This fluid moves and is governed by the central anima strictly in accordance with higher mechanical laws which are however not yet well understood Hoffmans speculations concerning the animal ether which he expressly identified with the sensory soul gave his system a dynamic cast inherited directly from Leibnitz whom he admiringly studied and this tended greatly to obscure the mechanical principles upon which he always insisted and to give his teachings which have had great influence in Germany some points of analogy with those of Stahl his famous adversary As the nervous system became known and gradually assumed a supreme position among the tissues many mechanical conceptions of the processes which underlie its functions were expressed in place of the old idea that nerves contracted and lengthened in occasioning motion They were sometimes said to vibrate like the strings of a harp or the molecules within them were thought to oscillate or their subtle fluids to mingle with others by diffusion Irritability one writer explained was a modification of general attraction and others thought nutrition and excretion were due to attraction and repulsion Part of the energy of the mechanical school went to seed in the shallow writers of the erclairissement some of it can be traced in monographic works on light and vision etc while among many wiser observers the conviction gained ground that chemistry and mechanical science were not yet suffi ciently developed to explain the more recondite processes of organic life and they naturally turned therefore to the purer and broader forms of theoretical empiricism represented by Bacon and Locke and to the development of the practical side of their respective professions During the present century however mechanical methods have attained a remarkable development in the German experimental school of physiology which has recreated the art and science of medi cine in that country equipping it with manifold thermal electric hydrostatic surgical and other apparatus and 82REFLEX ACTION methods and enriching the world with the multitude of facts grouped under the names neuro and psychophysics physio logical optics and acoustics myology and physiological chem istry Very prominent among the important physiological conceptions of this century is Marshall Halls theory of reflex action which first introduced a mechanical principle to ex plain the functions of the nervous centers of the spinal cord The discussion of this most important conception we must reserve for a later chapter Here however belongs a brief reference to one of the most interesting of all attempts to interpret physiological pro cesses by the aid of physical principles The phenomena of animal electricity were first studied in a part of the reflex apparatus of a frog If they have not explained all that was once hoped it was these studies which first introduced exact methods into the investigation of the functions of the nervous system With the collapse of mesmerism in the French revo lution the many speculations which had been rife concerning the relation between the magnetic and vital phenomena were quickly forgotten until in 1791 a new direction was given to physiological physics by Galvanis conception that the animal body preeminently the nerves was the seat of a peculiar and independent sort of electricity probably secreted chiefly in the brain He believed the inner substance of the nerves to consist of a very subtle and fluid lymph peculiarly adapted to conduct electricity and which was inclosed in a noncon ducting substance This electricity was stored up in the mus cles as in Kleist or Leiden jars to which the nerves were the conducting wires The outer surface of the muscles was nega tive their inner surface where the electricity accumulated was positive Motion was caused when this fluid was drawn from the interior to the exterior of the muscles along the nerves so that the cause of every contraction is like the dis charge of a Leiden jar the negative surface fibres of the mus cles being peculiarly irritable Although this theory was not strictly in accordance with the facts he had observed the greatest popular interest was again aroused Wherever there were frogs says Du BoisReymond and wherever two scraps of heterogeneous metal could be found every one sought to see for himself the miraculous reanimation of muti lated limbs Physiologists believed their ancient idea of a vital force had become tangible and physicians influenced by Galvanis too facile attempts to explain all sorts of nervous diseases sciatica tetanus and epilepsy thought no cure hence forth impossible Volta who was already an experi enced electrician easily demonstrated that the electricity which Galvani had at first observed came from metals and 83REFLEX ACTION not from the animal The former had the best of the con troversy until Galvani found that when the sciatic nerve was brought into contact with the muscle a contraction occurred without metals Volta still insisted that the current was not preexistent in the animal but was developed by the contact of different fluids in the tissues After repeating the experiments of Volta and Galvani with many variations Humboldt came to side with the former and although his observations fill two volumes they add little that is new in fact or valuable in theory In 1799 the year after Galvanis death Volta dis covered the pile which bears his name His erroneous con tact theory that whenever two heterogeneous substances are brought into contact one of them assumes a positive and the other a negative electrical condition absorbed scientific interest and galvanism was forgotten The frogpile was discovered and many attempts were made to explain animal electricity by physical hypothesis At last after applying Amperes astatic double needle to Schweiger s multiplicator which gave a far more delicate test for detecting the presence of electricity than had hitherto been known Nobili in 1826 demonstrated the frogcurrent which Galvani lacked the physical apparatus to do The muscle and nerve or the head and feet of a frog each immersed in a tiny cup containing salt solution into which the wires of the multiplier were introduced caused a permanent deviation of the needle demonstrating a constant current from the muscles to the nerves and from the head to the feet of the frog This current he believed to be of thermoelectric origin flowing from the warmer to the colder part The subject was taken up and advanced by Matteucci to whom Du BoisReymond in the historical sketch just referred to does much injustice by Valentin and Reymond himself The electrical properties and processes in nerves and muscles at rest and in action has now become one of the most compli cated of physiological problems while the preexistence of the current in the natural condition of the tissues which Rey mond advocates and his hypothesis of polar molecules arranged longitudinally through nerve and muscle fibers like a series of magnets to explain the phenomena of electrotonus and the development of the electrical current are rendered very questionable by the experiments of Hermann and Englemann In 1850 ten years after the publication of Reymonds inves tigations the time of the transmission of irritation along nervous fibers was first measured and found to be so great that all thoughts of identity or parallelism of electricity and the nervous energy efficient in sensation and motiona con Versuche fiber gereizte Muskel und Nervefasern Berlin 1797 84REFLEX ACTION ception which had considerable influence in inspiring and directing investigations up to that pointhad to be abandoned The wave of negative variation of the neural current which moves only about 28 metres per second is now considered as merely the accompanying sign or exponentand the only one we haveof a series of processes which constitute every nervous impulse the ulterior nature of which is as yet inscruta ble Even the nature of the processes of muscular contraction which besides the far slower negative wave is attended by thermal chemical and dioptric as well as molar changes is as yet only conjectural The application of electrical stimuli to animal tissues has proved the most fruitful of all physiological methods and it seems at first strange that its use in reflex studies should have been so very recent and scarcely less so that during the earlier investigations of galvanism the phenomena of reflex action should have attracted so little attention although it is evident from causual reference that it was often observed The reasons it is hoped will become apparent as we proceed Meanwhile we may observe that it is the exact mechanico empirical method that has accomplished everything almost without exception that has been done in the field of physiol ogy Just so far as experimenters have added explanations and theories to their demonstrations their work has crumbled and been forgotten while just so far as they directed and con fined their labors to the pure and clear presentation of typical facts and their conditions in such a way that others could readily find and reproduce them at will their contributions have been useful and permanent A new physical method is the most important contribution that can be made to science and through it to the sum of human knowledge and happiness This is no less true of neurological than of other studies Diseases have been classi fied in genera and species like plants according to the medi cines which it was thought were salutary according to the most elaborate schedules of subjective  symptomatic7 feel ings according to the organs they affected according to apriori philosophical schemes but a true natural basis of classification was reached only when the forms of cellchange or decay peculiar to each was known In a scarcely less rude and uncritical way psychic faculties and processes have long been classified and if the latter are ever to be soundly based on the varieties of structure and process in the nervous ele ments or substrata while we shall then feel surer of our knowledge of them and have a method of study which may reveal much now undreamed of only those most deeply versed in mechanical aspects of things and in the capability 85REFLEX ACTION of physical methods can understand how unaffected they must forever leave all the ideal goods which those who com prehend them least profoundly so often think imperiled The rapidity with which nervous processes traversed the nerves was thought by the physiologists of the last century to be analogous to that of light or else of lightning Some said it was as much more rapid than the blood as the nerve fibers were smaller than the aorta and some argued that it must be absolutely independent of time Haller falsely assumed that between every two contractions the way between muscles and the brain must be passed and repassed and estimated this rapidity at 9000 feet per minute As late as 1844 Johannes Miiller wrote we shall never have the means of measuring the rapidity of nervous processes because we can never com pare immense distances from which the rapidity of a process in the nerves in this respect analogous to that of light can be computed and again the time in which a sensation process from the periphery to the brain and cord and the reaction upon the peripheral parts by contraction follows is infinitely small and immeasurable One of the earliest achievements of Helmholtz however was in measuring these rapidities Although his apparatus compared with that now in use was very imperfect his resultthat irritations are propagated along motor nerve fibers at the rate of 2775 metres per secondwas tolerably accurate Most of his experiments were made by stimulating the sciatic nerve of a frog at points alternately near and far from its entrance into a muscle which recorded upon a swiftly revolving drum the movement when the resulting contraction began The effect of this discovery upon the conception of the nature of nervous action in general was great Helmholtz wrote as long as physiologists thought themselves compelled to refer nervous processes to the diffusion of an imponderable or psychic prin ciple it might seem incredible that the rapidity of the cur rent within the short distances of the animal body should be measurable Now we know from the investigations of Du BoisReymond on the electromotive properties of nerves that that activity which mediates the propagation of an irritation is at least very closely connected with a changed arrangement of their material molecules in fact is perhaps

j100358,The School Review,1074151,Notes,i244467,7he School Review A Theory of Dezvlopment and Heredity By HENRY B ORR PH D Professor at the Tulane University of Louisiana New York and London Macmillan  Co I893 pp vi255 The preiminently distinctive and dominant science of the pres ent century is biology This is evident not only from the immense amount of intellectual energy expended on biological investigation and the number and importance of the discoveries in this line but also from the influence which the facts theories and conceptions of this science is exercising in all fields of thought That the struggle for existence will explain in great measure if not indeed altogether the elimination of unfavorable variations and the preservation of favorable ones is generally accepted among biolo gists but as to the origin of these variations there is the widest difference of opinion Since the publication a few years ago of Weismanns theory of heredity according to which the transmission of acquired character is pronounced impossible the scientific would have been divided into two hostile campsthe opponents of this thing asserting and its advocates denying that the impressions of the environment on the individual organism are inherited by its descendants Professor Orr takes his stand in the antiWeis mannian camp and explains the phenomena of development and heredity by the laws of habit i e the perfecting of a process by continued repetition of the process The book shows a tendency at some points to take the assump tion of physiological psychology for conclusions and to confuse the nervous and the psychic In general however it is clear and thoroughly scientific in spirit The style is excellent It is a thoughtful and suggestive work and will be read with interest and profit by both the general reader and the special student The modesty and candor with which the author sets forth his conclusions is in happy contrast with the dogmatic assertiveness displayed by many recent writers on scientific philosophic subjects F C French Colgate University NOTES One cannot fail to be surprised in looking over the second edition of Kings HandBook of Nzew York City Moses King Boston Mass Price 2 at the amount of interesting and valu able information compressed within the limits of a thousand octavo pages The book has moreover over a thousand illustrations of points of interest and notable buildings in the city and it is only fair to say that the illustrationsare uniformly good New York as the metropolis of the new world has a great interest for all The book is well written and thoroughly entertaining 446Book Department Mr Henry Clark Johnson until recently president of the Central High School Philadelphia has prepared for use in American colleges a revision of Shuckburghs edition of Ciceros LaeliusMessrs Macmillan  Co Mr Shuckburgh used the text of Dr J S Reid and the reviser states that he has  corrected some errors and made some few changes in words punctuation and orthography The notes are based upon those of the English editors but Mr Johnson has made such additions to the commentary as he deemed necessary to fit the book for its special purpose and has added references to the grammars of Allen and Greenoughand Harkness The commen tary occupies about fiftyeight pages and seems to be sufficient for school purposes The reviser states that he has corrected numer ous misprints of the English editions but a somewhat hurried examination of the vocabulary shows that it contains many errors and inconsistencies in the matter of the quantities Thus for example arbitratus has the penult marked short cura the ultima long debeo and debilito both have the antepenult marked short the penult of dare is marked long In general the quantity is indicated in a happygoluck way so that it is impossible to see why some vowels are marked while others are left unmarked Thus on the same page the first vowel of ceterus is unmarked while the first vowel of cogito is marked long The spelling Sylla p 165 looks odd nowadays in a textbook Interesting reading matter will be found this month on the advertising pages at the end of this magazine The Tenmple Shakespeare New York Macmillan  Co 45 cents each vol now includes in rarely dainty little volumes Much Ado About Nothing   Loves Labours Lost The Merry Wives of Wind sor Two Gentlemen of Verona The Tempest  The Comedy of Errors  and Measure for Measure Where they can be afforded we cordially recommend the use of the separate volumes of this edition in school classes for the sake of the aesthetic cultivation that the students must get from using and owning such beautiful books We call especial attention to the classified list of new publications that appears from month to month on the last pages of the SCHOOL REvIEW The list this month is especially full and suggestive Great efforts have been put forth to make this list of value to our readers as a monthly bib liography of new publications of special interest to teachers in higher schools In this effort we have met with generous cooperation on the part of the publishers An examination of the list this month will we believe make our readers of our own opinion that no journal now gives a more valuable and more easily used current bibliography  447448 The School Review Praise is superfluous for the best The appearance of Skeats Edition of Chaucer Clarendon Press New York Macmillan  Co is distinctly an event in the world of letters The work is to be complete in six splen did volumes three of which have already appeared Vol I commences with a Life of Chaucer containing all the known facts and incidents that have been recorded with authorities for the same and dates It also contains the  Romaunt of the Rose and the minorpoems with a spe cial introduction and illustrative notes Vol II contains  Bcethius  and Troilus each with a special introduction The text of Troilus isa new one Vol III contains

serious students of English at the same time there is a clearness and charm of style about the introductions and notes that will attract anyone at all interested in our literature Admir able paper typography and presswork and a reliable buckram binding add substantially to the value of this altogether worthy collection of our great poets works Through these volumes a knowledge of his merit must inevitably be much extended CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE A Taste for Good Readling By PROF CHARLES ELIOT NORTON in Preface to Vol II of Heart of Oak Books A taste for good reading is an acquisition the worth of which is hardly to be overestimated and yet a majority of children even of those favored by circumstances grow up without it This defect is due partly to the fault or ignorance of parents and teachers partly also to the want in many cases of the proper means of cultivation For this taste like most others is usually not so much a gift of nature as a product of cultivation A wide difference exists indeed in children in respect to their natural inclination for reading but there are few in whom it cannot be more or less developed by careful and judicious training This training should begin very early Even before the child has learned the alphabet his mothers lullaby or his nurses song

 CO I893 PP VI255 THE PREIMINENTLY DISTINCTIVE AND DOMINANT SCIENCE OF THE PRES ENT CENTURY IS BIOLOGY THIS IS EVIDENT NOT ONLY FROM THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF INTELLECTUAL ENERGY EXPENDED ON BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION AND THE NUMBER AND IMPORTANCE OF THE DISCOVERIES IN THIS LINE BUT ALSO FROM THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE FACTS THEORIES AND CONCEPTIONS OF THIS SCIENCE IS EXERCISING IN ALL FIELDS OF THOUGHT THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE WILL EXPLAIN IN GREAT MEASURE IF NOT INDEED ALTOGETHER THE ELIMINATION OF UNFAVORABLE VARIATIONS AND THE PRESERVATION OF FAVORABLE ONES IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AMONG BIOLO GISTS BUT AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THESE VARIATIONS THERE IS THE WIDEST DIFFERENCE OF OPINION SINCE THE PUBLICATION A FEW YEARS AGO OF WEISMANNS THEORY OF HEREDITY ACCORDING TO WHICH THE TRANSMISSION OF ACQUIRED CHARACTER IS PRONOUNCED IMPOSSIBLE THE SCIENTIFIC WOULD HAVE BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWO HOSTILE CAMPSTHE OPPONENTS OF THIS THING ASSERTING AND ITS ADVOCATES DENYING THAT THE IMPRESSIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE INDIVIDUAL ORGANISM ARE INHERITED BY ITS DESCENDANTS PROFESSOR ORR TAKES HIS STAND IN THE ANTIWEIS MANNIAN CAMP AND EXPLAINS THE PHENOMENA OF DEVELOPMENT AND HEREDITY BY THE LAWS OF HABIT I E THE PERFECTING OF A PROCESS BY CONTINUED REPETITION OF THE PROCESS THE BOOK SHOWS A TENDENCY AT SOME POINTS TO TAKE THE ASSUMP TION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY FOR CONCLUSIONS AND TO CONFUSE THE NERVOUS AND THE PSYCHIC IN GENERAL HOWEVER IT IS CLEAR AND THOROUGHLY SCIENTIFIC IN SPIRIT THE STYLE IS EXCELLENT IT IS A THOUGHTFUL AND SUGGESTIVE WORK AND WILL BE READ WITH INTEREST AND PROFIT BY BOTH THE GENERAL READER AND THE SPECIAL STUDENT THE MODESTY AND CANDOR WITH WHICH THE AUTHOR SETS FORTH HIS CONCLUSIONS IS IN HAPPY CONTRAST WITH THE DOGMATIC ASSERTIVENESS DISPLAYED BY MANY RECENT WRITERS ON SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHIC SUBJECTS F C FRENCH COLGATE UNIVERSITY NOTES ONE CANNOT FAIL TO BE SURPRISED IN LOOKING OVER THE SECOND EDITION OF KINGS HANDBOOK OF NZEW YORK CITY MOSES KING BOSTON

SHUCKBURGHS EDITION OF CICEROS LAELIUSMESSRS MACMILLAN  CO MR SHUCKBURGH USED THE TEXT OF DR J S REID AND THE REVISER STATES THAT HE HAS  CORRECTED SOME ERRORS AND MADE SOME FEW CHANGES IN WORDS PUNCTUATION AND ORTHOGRAPHY THE NOTES ARE BASED UPON THOSE OF THE ENGLISH EDITORS BUT MR JOHNSON HAS MADE SUCH ADDITIONS TO THE COMMENTARY AS HE DEEMED NECESSARY TO FIT THE BOOK FOR ITS SPECIAL PURPOSE AND HAS ADDED REFERENCES TO THE GRAMMARS OF ALLEN AND GREENOUGHAND HARKNESS THE COMMEN TARY OCCUPIES ABOUT FIFTYEIGHT PAGES AND SEEMS TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES THE REVISER STATES THAT HE HAS CORRECTED NUMER OUS MISPRINTS OF THE ENGLISH EDITIONS BUT A SOMEWHAT HURRIED EXAMINATION OF THE VOCABULARY SHOWS THAT IT CONTAINS MANY ERRORS AND INCONSISTENCIES IN THE MATTER OF THE QUANTITIES THUS FOR EXAMPLE ARBITRATUS HAS THE PENULT MARKED SHORT CURA THE ULTIMA LONG DEBEO AND DEBILITO BOTH HAVE THE ANTEPENULT MARKED SHORT THE PENULT OF DARE IS MARKED LONG IN GENERAL THE QUANTITY IS INDICATED IN A HAPPYGOLUCK WAY SO THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WHY SOME VOWELS ARE MARKED WHILE OTHERS ARE LEFT UNMARKED THUS ON THE SAME PAGE THE FIRST VOWEL OF CETERUS IS UNMARKED WHILE

INEVITABLY BE MUCH EXTENDED CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE A TASTE FOR GOOD READLING BY PROF CHARLES ELIOT NORTON IN PREFACE TO VOL II OF HEART OF OAK BOOKS A TASTE FOR GOOD READING IS AN ACQUISITION THE WORTH OF WHICH IS HARDLY TO BE OVERESTIMATED AND YET A MAJORITY OF CHILDREN EVEN OF THOSE FAVORED BY CIRCUMSTANCES GROW UP WITHOUT IT THIS DEFECT IS DUE PARTLY TO THE FAULT OR IGNORANCE OF PARENTS AND TEACHERS PARTLY ALSO TO THE WANT IN MANY CASES OF THE PROPER MEANS OF CULTIVATION FOR THIS TASTE LIKE MOST OTHERS IS USUALLY NOT SO MUCH A GIFT OF NATURE AS A PRODUCT OF CULTIVATION A WIDE DIFFERENCE EXISTS INDEED IN CHILDREN IN RESPECT TO THEIR NATURAL INCLINATION FOR READING BUT THERE ARE FEW IN WHOM IT CANNOT BE MORE OR LESS DEVELOPED BY CAREFUL AND JUDICIOUS TRAINING THIS TRAINING SHOULD BEGIN VERY EARLY EVEN BEFORE THE CHILD HAS LEARNED THE ALPHABET HIS MOTHERS LULLABY OR HIS NURSES SONG

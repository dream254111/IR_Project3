j100568,Bulletin of the American Geographical Society,197575,Map Notices,i210236,MAP NOTICES BY HENRY GANNETT Since the last notice the U S Geological Survey has published twenty additional sheets of the Atlas of the United States Among these only one lies in New York and represents a bit of the south shore of Lake Ontario in Wayne County under the name of the Poultneyville sheet In New Jersey is one sheet Navesink on a scale of 125000 with contours at 20foot intervals It is situated in the eastern part of the State and comprises the coast from Sandy Hook to a point six miles south of Bay Head extending into the interior sufficiently far to take in New Brunswick It is a reduction and reproduction of four sheets upon the mile scale The country about Niagara Falls and Buffalo including the entire length of Niagara river is represented upon a sheet of irregular shape and size the scale being 62500 with a 20foot contour interval In Pennsylvania are four complete sheets besides parts of other sheets The four complete sheets are Indiana Kittanning La trobe and Tioga They are upon a scale of 62500 with contour intervals of 20 feet These represent areas in the northern or western parts of the State in the Allegheny plateau Here the plateau is deeply dissected by stream valleys with little appearance of system either in the valleys or ridges The four sheets which include Philadelphia and its environs have been printed to get her in onerapupon a scale of 62500 with a contour interval of 20 feet This is a very useful map and it includes a large area covered with dense settlement There are seven sheets representing in the main portions of Maryland most of them containing also parts of other States They are all upon a scale of 62500 with contour intervals of io or 20 feet Upon the Eastern Shore are Snow Hill entirely in Maryland Salisbury in Maryland and Delaware Princess Anne in Maryland and Virginia and Green Run in the same two States The first three of these sheets represent lowlying country traversed by marshy sluggish streams and whenever they include the sea coast it is low and bordered by belts of marsh The last Green 171Mazp Notices Run includes Chincoteague Bay and the sand bar separating it from the Atlantic Coast The Gunpowder sheet lies upon the west shore of Chesapeake Bay and represents a rolling country sloping down to a somewhat marshy coast Parkton which lies mainly in Maryland with a narrow strip of Pennsylvania on the north lies west of the head of Chesapeake Bay and represents a rolling coun try of no great relief Hancock which includes parts of Mary land Pennsylvania and West Virginia lies near the westward end of Maryland in the mountainous region and is traversed from west to east in a great curve by the Potomac river which here cuts a succession of gorges through the ridges which run across the coun try transverse to the course of the river In Wisconsin is one sheet Portage on a scale of 62500 with a contour interval of 20 feet It represents a country of irregular glacial hills with many swamps small lakes and crooked winding streams a region whose surface has been diversified by the Lau rentian glacier In Indiana and Kentucky is the Owensboro sheet which on a scale of i 62500 and contour interval of 20 feet represents a por tion of the valley of Ohio river The valley is a road extending from north to south across the sheet and is elevated a little above the river level Here and there however are hills standing up above the general low level of the bottom lands In Iowa there is one sheet known as Oelwein on a scale of 62500 with a contour interval of 20 feet It represents in the main a high rolling prairieconsiderably dissected in the southeastern part by streams flowing to Volga and Turkey rivers The Joplin lead and zinc region in southwestern Missouri and southeastern Kansas is represented upon a special map on a scale of T 62500 with a contour interval of io feet This sheet comprises an area of about 500oo square miles or the equivalent of two Atlas sheets This region which now produces most of the zinc of the United States as well as a notable part of the lead con sists in the main of a high rolling prairie traversed by the broad flood plains of several large streams and much dissected near the margins of their valleys Here have grown up several important centres of population induced by the mines such as Joplin Car thage Webb City and Galena In Wyoming is one sheet Mount Leidy situated in the western part of the State south of the Yellowstone Park and east of Jack sons Hole The scale is I I25ooo and the contour interval is oo00 feet The country consists of high bold mountains the Conti 172Map Notices nental Divide separating Wind river from the Snake traversing the eastern part of the sheet while the bulk of the sheet is made up of heavy spurs running westward from the summit In Oregon are two sheets both situated in the eastern part of the State and adjoining one another known as Baker City and Sumpter The scale is I I250oo and the contour interval Ioo feet Sumpter represents a portion of the crest of the Blue Moun tains here rising to altitudes of 9000 feet with the spurs on the east dropping down to the valley of Powder river and the broken country upon the west The Baker City sheet represents a por tion of the Blue Mountains with the upper valley of Powder river here flowing northward That portion of Southern California lying between latitudes 32o 40 and 33 40 and longitudes I 16 30 and 118 30 including the highlysettled and developed region from Los Angeles southward with the mountain ranges bordering it together with the southern edge of the Mohave Desert are represented upon a single sheet upon the scale of 1250000 with a contour interval of 250 feet About 8000 square miles are represented upon this map which brings together the great ranges of San Gabriel and San Bernardino which supply water to the extremely fertile valley to the south ward and the San Jacinto Mountains which also contribute to watering this region The scale of detail is sufficient to suggest at least the beautiful alluvial cones built up by the streams enter ing the valley from these mountains This is the most extensive artesian area on earth In Alaska is one sheet Forty Mile comprising the area lying between latitude 64 and 65 and longitude 141 and 142 an area of about 2600 square miles It is on a scale of 250000 with contour interval of 200 feet It represents a deeplydissected plateau rising from the Yukon which crosses its northeast corner at an altitude of about 500 feet above sealevel up to over 6000 feet in the highest summits while the general level is a little above 3000 feet Using the wellknown map of the District of Columbia on a scale of i 62500 as a basis a map of historical geology has been issued by the Geological Survey The Standard Map of Connecticut prepared under the direction of Joseph R Bien Julius Bien 6 Co publishers New York 1902 Scale about I 6so miles to an inch The streams are represented in blue culture in black and red 173174 Map Notices and the relief is expressed by brown crayon shading The bound aries of the towns cities and boroughs are emphasized by bands of color The map is in the main a reproduction of the Atlas sheets of the Geological Survey with a revision of the cultural features and a change in the method of expressing the relief It shows all the railroads country roads and the street plans of cities An added feature is the representation of trolley lines in the cities and rural districts These have had wonderful development in recent years Printed from stone the execution of the map is all that could be desired

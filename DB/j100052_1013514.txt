STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION BY ELLEN C LOMBARD B S SPECIAL COLLABORATOR UNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION THE HOME READING COURSES OF THE UNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO MEET A WELLDEFINED NEED FOR SYSTEMATIC READING NOT ONLY AMONG THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE CLASSICS BUT AMONG MANY WHO HAVE HERETOFORE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ GOOD BOOKS UNDER HELPFUL DIRECTION THROUGH THESE COURSES IT IS HOPED THAT ACQUAINTANCE WITH GOOD LITERATURE MAY BE PROMOTED THE GREAT BOOKS OF LITERATURE ARE THOSE WHICH REPRESENT THE IDEALS AND TENDENCIES OF THE PEOPLE OF WHOM THEY ARE WRITTEN THEY ARE MIRRORS IN WHICH ARE REFLECTED THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND ASPIRATIONS OF A RACE AN AGE OR A CIVILIZATION THEY LIVE THROUGH THE CENTURIES BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKEN FROM LIFE ALL PEOPLE MAY READ THE WORLDS GREATEST LITERATURE WITH PLEAS URE AND PROFIT IN SOME QUARTERS THE IMPRESSION HAS PREVAILED THAT CERTAIN BOOKS OF LITERATURE COULD NOT BE READ WITHOUT THE AID OF AN INSTRUCTOR OR AT LEAST OF AN OUTLINE IT IS A FACT THAT SO MUCH INSTRUCTION HAS SOMETIMES BEEN GIVEN ABOUT THESE GREAT BOOKS THAT A DISTASTE FOR THE BOOKS HAS BEEN CREATED IN THE READERS MINDS SCHOOLS HAVE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE IN BOYS AND GIRLS A DESIRE FOR READING AND TO TEACH THEM TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD LITERATURE THEY SET THE STANDARD TEACHERS MAY SO ESTABLISH THE READING HABIT THAT BOYS AND GIRLS WHO LEAVE SCHOOL AT AN EARLY AGE WILL BE SATISFIED WITH NOTHING LESS THAN THE BEST LITERATURE AND WILL SUPPLEMENT THEIR SCHOOL WORK BY MUCH READING IN AFTER LIFE MORE CONCENTRATED

STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION BY ELLEN C LOMBARD B S Special Collaborator United States Bureau of Education The Home Reading Courses of the United States Bureau of Education have been established to meet a welldefined need for systematic reading not only among those familiar with the classics but among many who have heretofore not had the opportunity to read good books under helpful direction Through these courses it is hoped that acquaintance with good literature may be promoted The great books of literature are those which represent the ideals and tendencies of the people of whom they are written They are mirrors in which are reflected the thoughts and feelings and aspirations of a race an age or a civilization They live through the centuries because they are taken from life All people may read the worlds greatest literature with pleas ure and profit In some quarters the impression has prevailed that certain books of literature could not be read without the aid of an instructor or at least of an outline It is a fact that so much instruction has sometimes been given about these great books that a distaste for the books has been created in the readers minds Schools have the best opportunity to create in boys and girls a desire for reading and to teach them to discriminate between good and bad literature They set the standard Teachers may so establish the reading habit that boys and girls who leave school at an early age will be satisfied with nothing less than the best literature and will supplement their school work by much reading in after life More concentrated reading may be done in the home than in the school where the attention is distracted by recitations and the confusion incident to schoolroom life Thousands of boys and girls are leaving school yearly before they have finished the grammar grades Thousands of men and women testify to their need of further education To meet this need the United States Commissioner of Education Dr P P Claxton has inaugurated the National Reading Circle 267268 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The plan already includes ten reading courses as follows 1 Great Literary Bibles 2 Masterpieces of the Worlds

Hartford Conn Professor Franklin L Riley of the Washington and Lee University and Professor William H Mace of Syracuse University Over three thousand men women boys and girls have enrolled in the National Reading Circle and are reading the books selected for the courses The readers represent all walks of lifeschool principals teachers students business men and women physicians lawyers ministers librarians School principals teachers and libra rians are assisting by forming small circles for reading House wives are forming reading circles among their neighbors The requirements are simple Each reader is asked to send to the Bureau of Education a notification when each book is begun and finished and to send a summary of every book read All courses are to be read once at least except the first course which is to be read twice When a course is completed test questions are sent to theHOME READING COURSES 269 reader When these are answered satisfactorily a certificate signed by the Commissioner of Education is given State library commissions and traveling library commissions are giving their aid placing the books at the disposal of the readers Local libraries are co6perating by placing the books in the courses on the shelves Library officials in all parts of the country report that the demand for serious books of this sort has never been so insistent as at the present time Upon application to the Home Education Division U S Bureau of Education Washington D C full information and the reading courses will be sent It is difficult to measure the full extent of this new work In addition to the large number of persons already on the rolls of the bureau who are taking the courses regularly there are many others who have been stimulated directly or indirectly by the bureaus efforts to give national attention to the importance of better read ing In this respect the reading courses are but one of a number of evidences of the federal governments newly awakened interest in the longneglected field of home education

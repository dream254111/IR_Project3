J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012494,JUSTICE FOR THE IMMIGRANT,I242637,JUSTICE FOR THE IMMIGRANT BY FRANCES A KELLOR NORTH AMERICAN CIVIC LEAGUE FOR IMMIGRANTS NEW YORK CITY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY SPENT OVER 700000 IN A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF IMMIGRATION ONE VOLUME IS DEVOTED TO CRIME THIS CONSISTS OF MORE THAN 400 PAGES CONTAIN ING AN ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF CRIMES BASED UPON COURT RECORDS THERE IS NO ATTEMPT MADE TO ANALYZE THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAWS VIO LATED NOR THE MANNER BY WHICH THESE VIOLATIONS WERE MADE INTO COURT RECORDS THROUGH LEGAL PROCEDURE IN FOURTEEEN VOLUMES WHICH THE IMMIGRATION COMMISSION DEVOTES TO INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS NO MENTION IS MADE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN SMALL INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITIES OF WHICH THERE ARE THOUSANDS MADE UP LARGELY OF IMMIGRANTS THE INVESTIGATION OF PEONAGE IN THE SOUTH OPENED THE EYES OF AMERICANS TO THE WAY IN WHICH JUSTICE CAN BECOME SUBSERVIENT TO INDUSTRIAL NECESSITIES AND BUSINESS EXPEDIENCY IT IS NO PART OF MY PURPOSE TO DISCUSS THE USE OR ABUSE OF LAWS DURING LABOR DISTURBANCES THAT INVESTIGATION IS ALREADY UNDER WAY BUT WHAT AMERICANS SHOULD WISH TO KNOW IS WHETHER THE LAWS AS AT PRESENT ADMINISTERED IN TIMES OF PEACE ARE GIVING THE IMMIGRANT EQUAL PROTECTION WE LOOK UPON COURTS AS PLACES OF PUNISHMENT AND THE IMMIGRANT RE GARDS THEM WITH FEAR IN REALITY THEY FILL A MUCH LARGER PLACE THAN THIS THEY ARE THE EDUCATIONAL CENTERS THROUGH WHICH MEN WHETHER COMPLAINANTS DEFENDANTS WITNESSES OR HANGERSON RECEIVE THEIR LASTING IMPRESSIONS OF FAIRNESS JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND IN ACCORD ANCE WITH WHICH THEY BECOME LAWABIDING RIGHTMINDED AND RIGHT FEELING CITIZENS OR GO FORTH WITH HATRED IN THEIR HEARTS CURSES ON THEIR LIPS AND THE DESIRE TO MAKE WAR ON A SOCIETY WHICH DENIES THEM JUSTICE THE IMMIGRANT DOES NOT START THE RACE FAIR WITH THE AMERICAN WE EXPECT HIM TO KNOW THE MULTITUDE OF LAWS AND ORDINANCES AND REGULATIONS IN A STRANGE COUNTRY WITH THE INSTITUTIONS AND CUSTOMS AND ORGANIZATION OF WHICH HE IS UNFAMILIAR WE EXPECT THE PEASANT TO ADJUST HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY TO A COMPLICATED CITY SYSTEM WE 159THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EXPECT HIM TO LEARN TO BE LAWABIDING TECHNICALLY AS WELL AS INTEN TIONALLY WITH THE HEAVY HANDICAP OF NOT KNOWING ENGLISH ALL THIS NOTWITHSTANDING AS A GOVERNMENT WE DO NOTHING TO INSTRUCT HIM OR INFORM HIM EITHER WHEN HE LANDS OR GOES INTO OUR INDUSTRIES AS TO HIS RESPONSIBILITIES OR DUTIES OR OBLIGATIONS WE ARE CONTENT TO LEAVE THIS TO THE PADRONE THE IMMIGRANT BANKER THE NOTARY PUBLIC THE SALOON AND TO SUCH ASSOCIATES AS HE MAY FIND OR FRIENDLY WELFARE ASSOCIATIONS AS HE MAY CHANCE UPON IT IS INEVITABLE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE SHOULD IN MANY INSTANCES BEAR ONE RELATION TO THE ALIEN AND ANOTHER TO THE AMERICAN I AM HERE CONCERNED MORE WITH A SYSTEM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH MAKES INJUSTICE SUBSERVIENCE TO BUSINESS INTERESTS DISHONESTY AND THE PERVERSION OF JUSTICE EASY THAN WITH THE CORRUPTNESS OF THE MEN WHO ADMINISTER THE LAWS IN THE BRIEF SPACE AT MY DISPOSAL I HOPE TO CALL ATTENTION TO A FEW OF THE CONDITIONS FOUND IN THE COURSE OF MY INVESTIGATIONS WHICH I HOPE WILL LEAD TO SUCH A STUDY OF OUR STATUTES AND PROCEDURE AS WILL RESTORE THE EQUALITY OF THE LAW AND WILL LEAD TO AN ANALYSIS OF CRIMINALITY AMONG ALIENS WHICH WILL INCLUDE AMONG ITS CAUSES AND EXPLANATIONS THE CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF LAWS TO WHAT EXTENT THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION OF LAW AFFECTS THE STATISTICS OF CRIME UNJUSTLY BRANDS IGNORANT OFFENDERS AS CRIMINALS OR CONFIRMS THEM AS SUCH PERVERTS THEIR SENSE OF JUSTICE AND DESTROYS THEIR RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER ARE UNANSWERABLE QUESTIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH INFORMATION WE ARE APPROACHING THE TIME WHEN CONVICTIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF ORDINANCES SUCH AS TRAFFIC REGULATIONS SANITARY CODES HEALTH LAWS AND SIMILAR MEASURES OF PRECAUTION VIO LATIONS OF WHICH DO NOT IMPLY CRIMINALITY WILL NOT BE TRIED IN CRIM INAL COURTS BUT IN MUNICIPAL AND OTHER CIVIL COURTS WHERE FINES AND NOT IMPRISONMENT WILL BE THE CHIEF PENALTY IMPOSED JUSTICES OF THE PEACE AND POLICE JUSTICES THESE INFLUENCE THE LIFE OF THE IMMIGRANT MOST DIRECTLY THE WAY IN WHICH THE LAW TREATS HIS EVERYDAY FRAILTIES IN SUCH MATTERS AS DRINK DISORDERLY CONDUCT VAGRANCY TRESPASS ASSAULT AND BATTERY PETIT LARCENY AND HIS CIVIL DIFFERENCES WITH HIS NEIGHBOR IS THE IMMIGRANTS MEASURE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND FAIRNESS OF REGULATION THE WAY IN WHICH IT TREATS HIS COMPLAINTS OF WAGES UNPAID OPPRESSION AND REGARD FOR HIS PERSONAL RIGHTS AND PROPERTY IS A GUIDE TO HIS FUTURE ACTIONS IN RELATION TO HIS FELLOWS 160JUSTICE FOR THE IMMIGRANT NEW YORK MAY BE TAKEN AS MORE OR LESS TYPICAL OF THE PREVAIL ING SYSTEM JUSTICES ARE ELECTED NOT APPOINTED AND ARE THEREFORE REMOVABLE ONLY BY THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT THROUGH A LONG AND DIFFICULT PROCESS THIS IS FURTHER SAFEGUARDED BY REQUIR ING A BOND FROM THE PERSON MAKING CHARGES TO BE AVAILABLE IN CASE OF THE FAILURE OF SUCH CHARGES UNDER THIS SYSTEM JUSTICES ARE RE SPONSIBLE ONLY TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN MATTERS OF DEPOSITING FINES AND RECEIVING FEES AND ARE USUALLY MEMBERS OF THE TOWN BOARD UNDER AN APPOINTIVE SYSTEM DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY WOULD BE ESTAB LISHED THE COMMON USE OF THESE OFFICES AS POLITICAL AWARDS TENDS STILL FURTHER TO LOWER THE STANDARD OF QUALIFICATIONS ANY MALE CITIZEN OTHER THAN A TAVERN KEEPER OVER 21 YEARS OF AGE IS ELIGIBLE TO OFFICE REGARDLESS OF ANY GENERAL OR LEGAL EDUCATION OF ANY KIND THIS JUSTICE WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF LAW OR SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS IS ENTRUSTED WITH POWER TO ISSUE WARRANTS ADMINISTER OATHS TAKE TESTIMONY AND DEPRIVE DEFENDANTS OF PROPERTY BY IM POSING FINES AND OF LIBERTY BY IMPOSING SENTENCES NOT EXCEEDING ONE YEAR JUSTICES RECEIVE NO SALARIES AND ARE PAID UNDER A FEE SYSTEM WHICH PUTS A PREMIUM ON DELAYS AND CONVICTIONS THE UNCER TAINTY OF THE FEES PROVIDES SO PRECARIOUS A LIVELIHOOD THAT SUCH JUS TICES USUALLY HAVE OTHER OCCUPATIONS THERE IS NO PROHIBITION AGAINST THEIR BEING EMPLOYED BY THE INDUSTRY UPON WHOSE CONTINUANCE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY FREQUENTLY DEPENDS TEAMSTERS MACHINISTS OR CLERKS OF SUCH COMPANIES FILL SUCH POSITIONS FEES ARE BASED UPON CERTAIN ACTS SPECIFIED BY LAW WHICH INCLUDE AMONG OTHERS THE FOLLOWING ISSUING SUMMONSES AND WARRANTS SWEARING JURORS DRAWING AFFIDAVITS SWEARING WITNESSES EVERY NEC ESSARY ADJOURNMENT OF CASES ENTERING SENTENCE OF COURT 25 CENTS AND FOR RECORD OF CONVICTION 75 CENTS AND FOR SERVICES WHEN ASSIST ING OTHER JUSTICES 2 A DAY ALL FINES ARE DEPOSITED WITH THE TOWN CLERK AND THE LAW PROHIBITS THE RETENTION OF ANY PART OF THESE THIS SYSTEM ENCOURAGES DELAYS MULTIPLICITY OF PAPERS ADJOURNMENTS AND CONVICTIONS IN ONE COURT WHERE 60 CASES WERE EXAMINED ONE THIRD OF THE SENTENCES WERE SUSPENDED PERMITTING THE COLLECTION OF THE ADDITIONAL FEE FOR RECORD OF CONVICTION THE RULES OF EVIDENCE WHICH SAFEGUARD DEFENDANTS IN OTHER COURTS ARE NOT OBSERVED CORROBORATION IS NOT REQUIRED IN SERIOUS 161THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OFFENSES LIKE LARCENY INTERPRETERS ARE NOT FURNISHED AND COMPLAINANTS AND CONSTABLES ARE PERMITTED TO SERVE AS SUCH THE POWER OF JUSTICE COURTS IN SOME STATES IS BROADER THAN IS GENERALLY KNOWN THEY MAY HAVE SUCH QUESTIONS AS CONSTITUTION ALITY OF THE LAW ARGUED BEFORE THEM BUT RARELY TAKE COGNIZANCE OF IT THEY MAY STAY PROCEEDINGS IF THE PARTIES APPEAR AND STATE THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED SATISFACTION PROVIDING THE REASON FOR THE STAY IS SET FORTH IN THE RECORDS THIS MAKES IT EASY TO USE THE POWERS OF THE JUSTICE TO COMPEL SETTLEMENTS UPON THREAT OF FINES OR IMPRISON MENT IF HE SO DESIRES IN NEW JERSEY THE PRACTICE IS TO COLLECT FEES DIRECTLY FROM THE LITIGANTS THE LAW OF 1898 PROVIDED THAT NO FEES SHOULD BE ALLOWED JUSTICES UNLESS THE PERSON AGAINST WHOM THE COMPLAINT WAS MADE WAS CONVICTED IN 1901 THIS WAS AMENDED SO THAT A JUSTICE WHO FILED A BILL OF PARTICULARS OF COSTS TO THE CLERK MIGHT BE PAID IF THERE WAS NO CONVICTION AN INVESTIGATION IN A NUMBER OF COUNTIES SHOWED THAT THIS LAW WAS NOT BEING ENFORCED IN OTHER WORDS THE ADMIN ISTRATORS OF LAW VIOLATED THE PROVISIONS GOVERNING THEIR OWN OFFICES IN SOME OF THE LARGEST CITIES OF THE STATE THE JUSTICE HAS NO AUTHOR ITY TO TRY THE CASE BUT ISSUES THE WARRANTS WHICH MUST BE PAID FOR WHEN ISSUED THIS HAS LED TO THE COMMON EXPRESSION AMONG THE FOREIGNERS I AM GOING DOWN TO BUY A WARRANT AGAINST YOU AN INVESTIGATION OF 38 WARRANTS ISSUED BY ONE JUDGE SHOWED THAT ONLY 7 WERE HELD FOR TRIAL IN MAKING THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT OF NOTABLE INSTANCES WHICH CAME TO MY ATTENTION AMONG OTHERS I WISH TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT UNDER THE PRESENT SYSTEM HUNDREDS OF JUSTICES ARE ADMINISTERING THE LAW FEARLESSLY AND HONESTLY AND WITH DUE REGARD TO THE RIGHTS OF ALL AT THE SAME TIME I WISH TO POINT OUT THAT THE SYSTEM IS SUCH THAT IT DEPENDS UPON THE MAN ELECTED AND NOT UPON THE LAWS WHICH GOVERN HIS OFFICE AND THE MANNER OF HIS ELECTION WHETHER HIS OFFICE IS AN INSTRUMENT OF JUSTICE OR A TOOL IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO WISH TO OPPRESS EXPLOIT AND INTIMIDATE THE IGNORANT IMMIGRANT UNFA MILIAR WITH AMERICAN LAWS INSTITUTIONS AND CUSTOMS THAT THESE OFFICERS ARE BEING USED FOR SUCH PURPOSES THERE IS ABUNDANT PROOF THE CONTEMPT IN WHICH THE OFFICE IS HELD THE USE OF IT AS A REWARD POLITICALLY ITS FREQUENT ISOLATION FROM PUBLICITY CENTERS THE CLAN SPIRIT WITH WHICH THE AMERICAN ELEMENT HOLDS TOGETHER PREVENTING PUBLICITY THE RACE PREJUDICE EXISTING IN SMALL TOWNS AND THE ISOLA 162JUSTICE FOR THE IMMIGRANT TION OF THE IMMIGRANT BY DISTRICTS AND BY LANGUAGE INCREASE THE NECESSITY FOR EVERY SAFEGUARD BEING AFFORDED BY THESE COURTS THE WRITER WAS CALLED UPON TO INVESTIGATE A SMALL INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY IN WHICH IT WAS ALLEGED THAT OPPRESSION EXTORTION AND GRAFT PREVAILED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE JUSTICES COURT THE COMPANY PRACTICALLY OWNED THE TOWN EXCEPT THE SALOONS IT EM PLOYED ONE OF THE JUSTICES AND ITS COUNSEL WAS COUNTY JUDGE A SALOONKEEPER AND A PADRONE WERE THE INTERPRETERS WHEN ONE WAS NEEDED IT WAS FOUND IN THE CASE OF BOTH JUSTICES THAT BILLS AND CLAIMS FOR FEES HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THE SUPERVISORS AND PAID WHICH THE DOCKET DID NOT SUBSTANTIATE THAT THEY HAD FAILED TO FILE RECORDS AS REQUIRED BY LAW THAT THEY HAD FALSIFIED ACCOUNTS AND SETTLED CASES IN VIOLATION OF LAW THERE BEING NO RECORD KEPT THAT THEY HAD NEGLECTED TO TRANSMIT THE FINES TO THE CLERK WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED BY LAW AND THAT THEY WERE INCOMPETENT AS SHOWN IN THEIR CONDUCT OF TRIALS I SUBMIT BRIEFLY THE RECORDS OF SEVERAL CASES SHOWING WHAT OCCURRED IN THAT VILLAGE AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SALOON KEEPER THE POLICEMAN AND THE JUSTICES THE DEFENDANT WAS EMPLOYED AS A DOMESTIC BY A SALOONKEEPER WHO ALSO ACTED AS THE COURT INTERPRETER SHE LEFT HIS EMPLOY WITHOUT NOTICE HE THREATENED TO GET EVEN WITH HER AND LATER ACCUSED HER OF STEALING 90 SHE WAS HALED BEFORE THE JUSTICE WHO COMPELLED HER TO SETTLE UNDER THREAT OF JAIL ASIDE FROM THE ACCUSATION OF THE SALOONKEEPER NO OTHER EVIDENCE WAS TAKEN THE DEFENDANT WAS ARRESTED DURING A FIGHT AND WAS ORDERED TO PAY 15 FOR A TORN COAT AND 1250 FOR COURT EXPENSES ONLY THE COMPLAINANTS TES TIMONY WAS TAKEN YET BOTH HE AND THE DEFENDANT WERE EACH REQUIRED TO PAY 5 FOR THE INTERPRETER TWO DEFENDANTS TESTIFIED THAT THEY HAD BEEN ARRESTED AND SENTENCED TO SETTLE A CLAIM OF 50 FOR APPLES PICKED BY THEIR WIVES THEY PAID 40 IN COURT AND PAID THE BALANCE TO THE POLICEMAN IN ADDITION THEY PAID 1250 COSTS A COMPLAINANT IN A CASE TESTIFIED THAT AFTER BEING ASSAULTED BY THE DEFEND ANT HE PAID THE LOCAL POLICE OFFICER 12 6 FOR HIMSELF AND 6 FOR THE JUSTICE IN ORDER TO HAVE THE DEFENDANT ARRESTED AND BE FOUND GUILTY THE LATTER WAS ARRESTED THE FOLLOWING DAY AND WAS FINED 5 THE DEFENDANT DID NOT BUY HIS BEER FOR A CHRISTENINGFROM THE SALOON KEEPER INTERPRETER HE WAS THEREAFTER ARRESTED FOR VIOLATING SOME SUNDAY LAW AND WAS FINED 75 BY THE JUSTICE THE COMPLAINANT IN A CIVIL ACTION FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUSTICE TESTIFIED THAT HE HAD RENTED A BOARDING HOUSE FROM THE SALOONKEEP ER INTERPRETER AS THE LATTERS SALOON WAS NOT PATRONIZED BY THE COMPLAIN ANTS BOARDERS HE SHUT OFF THE WATER SUPPLY FOR THE HOUSE THE COMPLAINANT 163THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WAS FORCED TO MOVE AND SOLD HIS FURNITURE FOR 245 RECEIVING A DEPOSIT OF 100 THE SALOONKEEPER ADVISED THE PURCHASER NOT TO PAY THE BALANCE AND SENT WORD TO THE COMPLAINANT THAT UNLESS THE DEPOSIT WAS RETURNED HE WOULD HAVE HIM SENTENCED TO JAIL HE RETURNED THE DEPOSIT AND SOLD HIS FURNITURE TO ANOTHER FOR 180 RECEIVING A 50 DEPOSIT BUT THE LATTER WAS ALSO ADVISED BY THE SALOON KEEPER NOT TO PAY THE BALANCE THE COMPLAINANT APPEALED TO THE JUSTICE WHO LATER GAVE HIM 2333 AS HIS SHARE OF THE AMOUNT COLLECTED ALTHOUGH THE PUR CHASER TESTIFIED THAT HE HAD GIVEN THE JUSTICE ABOUT 60 NO RECORD COULD BE FOUND OF THE DISPOSITION OR SETTLEMENT OF THE CASE THE DEFENDANT WAS ARRESTED ON A CHARGE OF ASSAULT IN THE THIRD DEGREE THE INTERPRETER CALLED THE DEFENDANT OUTSIDE OF THE COURT ROOM AND INFORMED HIM THAT THE JUSTICE SAID IT WOULD TAKE 5535 TO SETTLE THE CASE OTHERWISE HE WOULD BE SENT TO JAIL THE DEFENDANT THE JUSTICE AND THE INTERPRETER THEN WENT TO THE LATTERS SALOON WHERE A CHECK FOR THIS AMOUNT WAS MADE OUT TO THE ORDER OF THE INTERPRETER WHO TESTIFIED THAT HE GAVE THE JUSTICE THE FULL AMOUNT THEREOF IN CASH THE JUSTICE THEN RETURNED TO THE COURT ROOM ALONE AND PAID THE COMPLAINANT WHO HAD BEEN TOLD TO WAIT FOR HIM THE SUM OF 3150 FOR WHICH HE SIGNED A RECEIPT ACCORDING TO THE LATTERS SWORN TESTIMONY THE JUSTICES DOCKET WHEN EXAMINED LATER CONTAINED THE ENTRY GUILTY SENTENCE SUSPENDED HAS TWO SMALL CHILDREN NO FUNDS AND SHOWED THAT THE COSTS HAD BEEN ASSESSED AT 380 AFTER DEDUCTING THE INTERPRETERS FEE OF 3 THERE STILL REMAINED 2085 UNRECORDED AND UNACCOUNTED FOR WHILE THIS INVESTIGA TION WAS BEING CONDUCTED THE COMPLAINANT WAS COMPELLED TO SIGN A NEW RECEIPT FOR 45 WHILE THE DEFENDANT WAS ADVISED TO LEAVE TOWN AND THREATENED WITH DISCHARGE FROM WORK A DISPUTE AS TO THE NONPAYMENT OF A DEBT OF 10 HAD ARISEN BETWEEN A SALOONKEEPER AND THE DEFENDANT AS THE LATTER WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE VILLAGE EN ROUTE ABROAD HE WAS ARRESTED AT THE RAILROAD STATION AT 10 PM AND IMME DIATELY BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUSTICE WHO FORCED HIM TO PAY THE SUM OF 19 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DEBT AND THE AMOUNT PAID WAS IN REALITY IN THE NATURE OF A FINE AS THE COSTS IN ALL CASES ARE CHARGED TO THE TOWN THE DEFENDANT HAD BEEN ARRESTED ON A CHARGE OF PETTY LARCENY HE PAID THE JUSTICE 5 OUT OF COURT AND WHEN THE CASE WAS LATER CALLED WAS INFORMED HE WAS DISCHARGED THE DOCKET HOWEVER READ THAT SENTENCE HAD BEEN SUS PENDED THEREBY MAKING HIM GUILTY OF THE CRIME AS A MATTER OF FACT THE DEFENDANT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ORIGINALLY CHARGED WITH THE CRIME AS AN EM PLOYEE HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN THE MONEY IN QUESTION EACH INDIVIDUAL BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL ACTS WARRANTS OF ARREST FOR ASSAULT IN THE THIRD DEGREE HAD BEEN ISSUED AGAINST 6 PERSONS ONLY FOUR HAD BEEN APPREHENDED YET THE OTHER TWO ACCORDING TO THE DOCKET WERE NOTED AS GUILTY SENTENCE SUSPENDED THESE JUSTICES ARE HOLDING OFFICE TODAY THE INVESTIGATION WAS COM PLETED IN THE SUMMER WHEN THE SUPREME COURT VESTED WITH THE POWER OF REMOVAL WAS NOT IN SESSION THE OWNERS OF THE INDUSTRY INVOLVED TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND AS THEY WERE THE POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE COUNTY AND 164JUSTICE FOR THE IMMIGRANT THE MAIN TAXPAYERS THEIR INTERFERENCE WAS SUCCESSFUL SOME OF THE COMPLAINING WITNESSES WERE DISMISSED AND AS THERE WAS NO OTHER IN DUSTRY NEAR THEY LEFT FOR PARTS UNKNOWN AFFIDAVITS WERE SUBSE QUENTLY OBTAINED UNDER DURESS IN WHICH THEY DENIED THEIR TESTIMONY THEY WERE INTIMIDATED THEY WERE BRIBED TO LEAVE TOWN AND THE AC TION FOR REMOVAL WAS DELAYED ON ONE PRETEXT OR ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CASE WAS RENDERED SO WEAK THAT SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION WAS DOUBTFUL NEVER WAS A BETTER CASE PRESENTED ON BEHALF OF THE RE CALL OF JUDGES WHICH WOULD HAVE PERMITTED THE FACTS TO HAVE BEEN LAID PROMPTLY BEFORE THE PEOPLE AS IT WAS EVEN PUBLICITY WAS DENIED AS THE COUNTY PAPERS WERE ALSO UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE OWNERS IN ANOTHER CASE FOUR MEN COMPLAINED THAT THEY HAD BEEN ILLE GALLY ARRESTED FOR PETIT LARCENY SIX IMMIGRANTS LEFT AN EMPLOYMENT AGENCY IN NEW YORK SEPTEMBER 22 TO WORK ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DAM FOR A LARGE PAPER FACTORY THEIR FARE OF 3 BY BOAT AND 75 CENTS FOR MEALS AND THE FEE FOR THE JOB WERE TO BE DEDUCTED FROM THEIR FIRST WAGES THEY ARRIVED ABOUT 10 AM SEPTEMBER 23 AND WERE TO GO TO WORK ON THE MORNING OF THE 24TH THEY WERE TOLD BY THE PADRONE THAT THEY COULD HAVE NO FOOD UNTIL THEY PAID FOR IT TWO OF THEM HAD MONEY BUT THE FOUR OTHERS DID NOT THE FOUR WERE GIVEN A PIECE OF BREAD AND SOME SAUSAGE WHICH WAS ALL THE FOOD THEY HAD FROM NOON SEPTEMBER 22 UNTIL THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 24 WHEN THEY REFUSED TO WORK WITHOUT BREAKFAST AND WENT AWAY THE JUSTICE WAS EMPLOYED AS MACHINIST BY THE COMPANY AND THE SUPERINTENDENT SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THEM FOR NOT WORKING OUT THEIR FARE AND THEY WERE ARRESTED AND SENTENCED TO 30 DAYS IN JAIL BUT WERE PROMPTLY RELEASED ON HABEAS CORPUS PRO CEEDINGS BROUGHT BY THE STATE BUREAU OF INDUSTRIES AND IMMIGRATION THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM AN ALIEN IN PENNSYLVANIA IS OF INTEREST IN THIS COUNTY AND PARTICULARLY IN THIS BOROUGH IT HAS BECOME THE PRAC TICE OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE AND OTHERS WHO ARE AIDING IN THE SCHEME TO EXTORT MONEY IN VARIOUS WAYS FROM THE FOREIGN PEOPLE ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL THINGS PRACTICED IS TO BRING THEM IN BEFORE THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE ON SOME CRIMINAL INFORMATION WHETHER THEY HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW OR NOT AND THEN DEMAND LARGE SUMS OF MONEY FROM THEM UNDER THE GUISE OF A SETTLEMENT AND THEN LET THEM GO OR IN SOME INSTANCES HOLD THEM FOR COURT EXPECTING THAT THEY WILL STILL PAY MORE MONEY AND IF SO THEN MANAGE TO GET THE CASE NOLPROSSED WITH OUT A TRIAL OTHERS WHO SEEM TO LIVE UPON WHAT THEY CAN EXTORT BY SOME MEANS FROM THESE FOREIGNERS HAVE A PRACTICE OF GOING TO THEM AND DEMANDING 165THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MONEY UNDER THREAT THAT IF THEY DO NOT PAY THEY WILL BE TAKEN TO JAIL IT IS VERY HARD FOR ANY ONE LOCATED HERE TO GET A HOLD ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRAC TICING THESE THINGS FOR THEY ARE COMBINED TOGETHER AND THREATEN THE FOREIGN ERS IF THEY TELL THESE THINGS THE FOLLOWING CASE AMONG MANY OTHERS WAS SUBMITTED IN SUP PORT OF THIS STATEMENT IN DECEMBER 1912 A POLE WAS ARRESTED FOR SELLING LIQUOR WITHOUT A LICENSE AND WHEN BROUGHT BEFORE A JUSTICE WAS INFORMED THAT THE CASE COULD BE SETTLED FOR 200 FOR THE COMPLAINANT AND 100 AS COSTS FOR THE JUSTICE THE POLE COULD NOT OR DID NOT PUT UP THE MONEY AND THE JUSTICE WAS ABOUT TO SEND HIM TO JAIL WHEN AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT OF A BANK MADE AN OFFER TO GO BAIL FOR HIM IF HE WOULD GO HOME AND BRING UP HIS BANK BOOK SO THAT HE COULD FIX THE BANK ACCOUNT TO PROTECT HIM FOR GOING HIS BAIL THIS WAS ARRANGED AND THE POLE WENT HOME BUT DID NOT COME BACK WITH THE BANK BOOK BUT WENT AWAY AND WAS NOT IN THE COUNTY FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS WHEN THIS ACCOMPLICE LEARNED THAT THE POLE HAD LEFT HE AND THE JUSTICE BETWEEN THEM ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF THE WIFE OF THE POLE WHEN THE JUSTICE HAD NO INFORMATION AGAINST HER THEN OR AT ANY OTHER TIME AND PLACED THE WARRANT IN THE HANDS OF A MEMBER OF THE STATE CONSTABULARY WHO WENT TO ARREST HER THE CATHOLIC PRIEST AND RAILWAY AGENT AT THAT PLACE INTERCEDED FOR HER AND FOUND HER HANDCUFFED IN HER HOUSE WAITING UNTIL TRAIN TIME AND UNDER THE CUSTODY OF THE OFFICER THE PRIEST CALLED UP THE JUSTICE ON THE PHONE AND ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT HIM AS BAIL FOR HER AND ALLOW HER TO REMAIN AT HOME AS SHE HAD THREE YOUNG CHILDREN THERE AND NO ONE TO CARE FOR THEM IF SHE WAS TAKEN AWAY HE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE PRIEST AS BAIL BUT IF SHE WOULD TURN OVER HER BANK BOOK TO THE OFFICER SHE MIGHT REMAIN AT HOME AND IF NOT SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE BROUGHT TO COURT AND THE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN WITH HER IF NECESSARY SHE HAD NO BANK BOOK TO PUT UP AT THAT TIME AND THE CONSTABULARY TOOK HER AND HER THREE SMALL CHILDREN TO JAIL THE ACCOMPLICE MET THEM NEAR THE JAIL AS THE OFFICER WAS BRINGING THEM IN AND SAID TO HER NOW YOU WILL STAY IN JAIL THIS WAS ON A SATURDAY EVE NING AND THEY ALL WERE PLACED IN JAIL AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL MONDAY SOME TIME WHEN HE GOT UNEASY FOR FEAR THE HUMANE AGENT WOULD GET TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND WENT WITH A WOMAN TO THE JAIL AND PROPOSED TO TAKE THE CHILDREN OUT AND TAKE THEM TO THE WOMANS HOUSE THE CHILDREN CRIED AND THEN THEY TOOK HER AND THE CHILDREN ALL OUT TO THE HOUSE OF THIS WOMAN WHO KEPT A SORT OF RESTAURANT IN THE TOWN HERE THEY WERE KEPT FOR ABOUT TWO DAYS AND HOUNDED FOR MONEY OR A BANK ACCOUNT NATURALIZATION THE ADMISSION TO CITIZENSHIP IS THE HIGHEST HONOR WHICH THIS COUNTRY CAN CONFER NO ACT SHOULD BE SO FREE FROM EXPLOITATION AS THIS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED A HIGH STANDARD OF QUALIFICATIONS BUT IN ADDITION TO THIS A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS MAKING THE EARNING OF A LIVELIHOOD DEPEND 166JUSTICE FOR THE IMMIGRANT ENT UPON NATURALIZATION OR THE OBTAINMENT OF FIRST PAPERS THIS IMMEDIATELY OPENS THE DOOR TO GRAFT ENCOURAGES DISHONESTY AND MAKES NATURALIZATION NOT A HIGH PRIVILEGE BUT A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO GOING TO WORK THIS RESULTS IN WHOLESALE EVASION OF THE LAW WHICH IS A PART OF THE EARLY EDUCATION OF THE NEWLY ARRIVED ALIEN WHOSE FIRST INTRODUCTION TO AMERICA IS AS A PROTECTED LAW BREAKER THESE LAWS APPLY PRIMARILY TO EMPLOYEES ON PUBLIC WORKS AND TO TRADES IN WHICH A LICENSE IS REQUIRED IN NEW YORK CITY THIS RE STRICTION HAS LED TO WHOLESALE FRAUDS AND EXCHANGES IN LICENSES AND THERE ARE RECORDS SHOWING THAT THE LITTLE GREEK BOYS WHO PEDDLE FLOWERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AS MANY AS FIVE TIMES DURING THEIR FIRST FEW MONTHS IN THE COUNTRY FOR PEDDLING WITHOUT A LICENSE THE PADRONI SAY IT IS CHEAPER TO PAY FINES AS THEY CANNOT GET LICENSES THE POLITICAL LEADERS ALSO TURN THIS REQUIREMENT TO GREAT ADVANTAGE BY ASSISTING MEMBERS OF THEIR CLUBS TO OBTAIN FIRST PAPERS AND LI CENSES THEREBY CONTROLLING THE VOTERS FROM AMONG MANY CASES THIS IS OF SIGNIFICANCE AN ALIEN HAD HIS FIRST PAPERS AND WANTED TO GET HIS FINAL PAPERS A RUNNER AND SHYSTER LAWYER OFFERED TO GET THEM FOR HIM HE TURNED OVER HIS FIRST PAPERS AND PAID 5 TO THE LAWYER AND WAS TOLD TO DE POSIT 9 WITH A SALOONKEEPER AS A GUARANTEE HE WAS TAKEN FOUR TIMES TO THE COURT AND THE LAWYER DEMANDED HIS EXPENSES PAID THE ALIEN HAD NO MONEY AND WAS ASKED TO SIGN A PAPER WHICH HE FOUND WAS USED AFTERWARD TO COLLECT THE 9 DEPOSITED WITH THE SALOONKEEPER FIVE DOLLARS MORE WAS THEN DEMANDED AND HE SIGNED A MEMORANDUM AGREEING TO PAY THE RUNNER FOR HIS SERVICES AS FOLLOWS LOST TIM E M AY 8 9 10 6 O NE DAY LOST M AY 19  5 SPARE TIME GIVEN TO LAWYER MAY 28   4 LOST ONE DAY JUNE 11 5 SPARE TIME GIVEN TO LAWYER JUNE 14  2 SPARE TIME GIVEN TO LAWYER JUNE 18  2 24 AT THE TIME THE CASE CAME TO MY NOTICE HE HAD LOST HIS FIRST PAPERS PAID 14 LOST SEVERAL DAYS WORK AND HAD NOT OBTAINED HIS PAPERS THE EXTENT OF THESE FRAUDS IS COLOSSAL BOGUS NATURALIZATION SOCIETIES AND SCHOOLS FOR ENGLISH HAVE BEEN FOUND WHICH ARE COVERS 167THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FOR AMBULANCE CHASERS INSURANCE SCHEMES AND LAND SALES ONE SUCH SOCIETY HAD OVER 3000 PERSONS REGISTERED THERE IS A BILL NOW PENDING BEFORE CONGRESS ASKING FOR A COM MISSION TO TAKE UP THIS WHOLE SUBJECT AND RECOMMEND ADJUSTMENT OF THE INEQUALITIES AND ELIMINATION OF ABUSES AND I DOUBT IF THERE IS ANY SUBJECT MORE IN NEED OF SUCH AN INVESTIGATION IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN A THEORY OF EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL IN THE FACE OF SOME OF THE LAWS WHICH HAVE BEEN ENACTED IT WERE FAR BETTER IN MY JUDGMENT TO MAINTAIN A STRICT AND CONSISTENT POLICY OF EXCLUSION FOR THE PROTECTION OF AMERICAN LABORERS THAN TO DISCRIMI NATE AGAINST MEN TO WHOM WE HAVE OPENED OUR DOORS AND WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS VERSION OF JUSTICE SUCH ARE THE WORKMENS COM PENSATION LAWS WHERE ALIENS ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED FROM BECOMING BENEFICIARIES OR WHERE NONRESIDENT FAMILIES MAY NOT RECEIVE MORE THAN TWOTHIRDS OF THE AMOUNT PAYABLE TO RESIDENT FAMILIES OR WHERE THE AMOUNT FOR ALIENS IS LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM OF 750 ON THE OTHER HAND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES LOOKING TOWARD THE ASSIMILATION OF IMMIGRANTS HAS BEEN STRENU OUSLY OPPOSED AS DISCRIMINATING AND AS TENDING TO INCREASE IMMI GRATION THE PAST DECADE HAS SEEN HOWEVER A STEADY DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH AGENCIES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE IS THE ESTAB LISHMENT BY NEW YORK STATE OF A BUREAU OF INDUSTRIES AND IMMIGRA TION WHICH CREATES IN EFFECT AN IMMIGRANTS COURT THIS HAS THE POWER TO MAKE INVESTIGATIONS HOLD HEARINGS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS THIS EXPERIMENT HAS DONE MORE TO REDUCE THE LAWS DELAYS OBTAIN JUSTICE AND FAIR TREATMENT FOR THE IMMIGRANT AND MAINTAIN HIS FAITH IN AMERICAN FREEDOM AND JUSTICE THAN ANY OTHER ONE SINGLE EXPERI MENT CALIFORNIA HAS RECENTLY ESTABLISHED A COMMISSION ON IMMIGRA TION AND HOUSING WITH SIMILAR POWERS AND CLEVELAND HAS ESTABLISHED THE FIRST MUNICIPAL AGENCY IN THE FORM OF A CITY IMMIGRATION BU REAU WHICH TAKES CHARGE OF ALL IMMIGRANTS IN NEED OF INFORMATION ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE IT IS THROUGH SUCH MEASURES AND AGENCIES AS THESE THAT THE ALIEN WILL FINALLY RECEIVE THE FULL MEASURE OF JUSTICE WHICH SHOULD ACCOM PANY HIS ADMISSION AND IT IS TO THESE WE MUST LOOK FOR A BETTER KNOWL EDGE AND ADMINISTRATION OF OUR LAWS THROUGH THE MINOR COURTS WHICH BEAR SO IMPORTANT A RELATION TO THE IMMIGRANT 168

Certain Vegetable Poisons Abstract,i207043,397 this indeed appears but a feeble tribute of respect to the services which he has rendered to the science of mineralogy Since the crystallization of certain mineral substances in which nothing but earths has been discovered has appeared problematical to many persons and has led to the supposition of the existence of unknown acids in their composition Mr Smithson endeavours to explain this difficulty by suggesting that quartz itself may be con sidered as an acid to which class of bodies it has analogous quali ties we shall then have a numerous class of silicates both simple and compound and zeolite will belong to the latter and may be regarded as a hydrated silicate of alumina Experiments and Observations on the different Modes in which Death is produced by certain vegetable Poisons By B C Brodie Esq FRS Communicated by the Society for promoting the Knowledge of Animal Chemistry Read February 21 1811 Phil Trans 1811p 1781 The substances selected for these experiments are vegetable poisons only and they were chosen of the most active kind that the exact nature of their effects might be more readily discerned The prin cipal object of the experiments is to determine on which of the vital organs the influence of each poison is exerted and through what medium the organ becomes affected The first series of experiments relates to the effects of internal application to the tongue and ali mentary canal and the second to the consequences of application to external wounds When proof spirit was given to a rabbit in sufficient quantity to kill it the heart was observed to continue in action after apparent death The same observation was made respecting the heart of a cat killed by injecting the root of aconite into the rectum When the oil distilled from bitter almonds was employed although no more than a single drop had been given to a cat she died in five minutes Two drops of the same oil injected into the rectum of an other cat killed it also in five minutes And the heart in each in stance continued acting after apparent death Distilled oil of tobacco exerted nearly the same energy as the distilled oil of bitter almonds and apparently in the same way as the heart was observed to contract after apparent death From this circumstance Mr Brodie inferred that these poisons exert their primary influence on the brain and that death ensues in consequence of the suspension of respiration which is dependent on the brain When an infusion of tobacco was made use of instead of the em pyreumatic oil and injected into the rectum the effects were different from any of the preceding as the heart continued to contract and was uniformly found in a state of extreme distension Mr Brodie is however of opinion that the heart was not directly affected but through the medium of the nervous system For when the same398 infusion was injected into the rectum of a dog whose head had been cut off and whose respiration was kept up by artificial means the heart continued to act in the same manner as in the experiments which Mr Brodie lately communicated to the Society without being sensibly affected by the infusion The authors trials of the external application of poisons were con fined to the essential oil of bitter almonds the juice of aconite and the South American poison called Woorara They all produced the same effects as the two former had done when applied internally for the heart was observed to contract as before long after other sym ptoms of life had ceased so that the circulation could be kept up by means of artificial respiration With respect to the medium through which poisons affect the brain when they are applied to external wounds the authors expe riments were confined to the woorara And he endeavoured to de termine whether the influence was conveyed by the nerves or whether the poison itself entered the circulation either by the absorbents or through the divided veins By dividing the nerves of a part the efficacy of the woorara did not appear diminished neither did tying up the thoracic duct in any degree interfere with its action But when a ligature was applied round the leg of a rabbit so as not to include the sciatic nerve the rabbit was not in the least affected by the woorara The author consequently infers that the woorara acts upon the brain by passing into its substance through the divided vessels of the part to which it is applied Since the circulation of an animal could be kept up by an artificial respiration after the brain had been even completely removed Mr Brodie conceived it possible that the functions of the brain might be found to recover from temporary suspension if the circulation were continued for a time by artificial respiration and that thus the life of the animal might be preserved After two experiments which were not attended with complete success a third was made upon a rabbit by applying distilled oil of almonds to a wound in the side In five minutes it ceased to breathe and was apparently dead but by means of artificial respiration con tinued for sixteen minutes it was completely restored to life and on the following day appeared not to have suffered from the experiment On the Causes which influence the Direction of the Growth of Roots By Thomas Andrew Knight Esq FRS In a Letter to the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks Bart KB PRS Read March 7 1811 Phil Trans 1811 p 209 In a former paper Mr Knight showed the influence of gravitation on the plumule and radicle of germinating seeds in the present he considers the fibrous roots which with little comparative regard to gravity extend themselves in whatever direction the greatest nutri ment or moisture is to be found with an appearance of predilection

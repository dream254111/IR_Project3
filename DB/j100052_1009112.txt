they are different There is the same vastness of territory the same severity and variety of climate a similar conglomera tion of people and races the same undeveloped natural resources and necessity of capital and skill to take advan tage of them The paternal government of Russia and the enterprise of her German citizens have given her a number of large finan cial institutions however to make real estate loans which it is my object to describe here because it is the lack of such institutions in the United States which is chiefly to blame for the enormous rates of interest revealed by the census mortgage statistics of I890 recently published As a rule the rate of interest on mortgages as well as the rate on public loans of any community will indicate its economic condition but the mortgage statistics published this year for Russia show that with a strained public credit an inconvertible paper currency an ignorant populationf an unenterprising upper class and the entire absence of a middle class Russia as far as her mortgage statistics are concerned still compares favorably with the United States As in the United States so also in Russia it is the richest and most prosperous localities that have the heaviest mort gage indebtedness the property of the poorer districts being always subject to shorter loans at higher rates and for smaller amounts On the map issued with the statistics from St Petersburg onethird is red of different shades See my article on Mortgage Banking in AmericaJournal of Political Economy March 1894 t Of the men less than ten per cent know how to

these tables it appears that twentynine per cent of the loans on lands have been made by private banks thirtytwo and onehalf per cent by government banks and thirtyeight and onehalf per cent by mutual associations and Russia thus affords an illustration of the three principal different systems of mortgage banking that are carried on in Europe today To obtain the total mortgage indebtedness of Russia should be added however to these figures of 1695871933 roubles also a sum for loans made by private individuals and furthermore the debt of 87200oo00 roubles which is due from the village communities of liberated serfs to the Rus sian Government The liberation of the serfs in i860 marks an epoch in all things Russian The change itself was of less immediate consequence to most of the serfs than to their masters The former wanted to be free and to become the owners of all their land The latter wanted them to be free but to have no land What took place then was a division of the

deciatines giving to every family of three male members from twentyfive to forty acres The peasants had hoped for more land and in many cases preferred serfdom with compulsory labor on the manor to the compulsory pur chase of land now adopted Each village community was when the change was finally completed at the accession of Alexander III compelled to purchase its land in common paying to the government besides the interest of six per cent a small annual installment which will redeem the land in fortynine years and which is assessed with the other taxes on each village community The nobles were paid for the land in government bonds of different kinds Thus the old village community was continued and today the  Three Field System with a lot around each house owned individually long narrow scattered strips of plough land allotted periodically and pasture land held in common is still the usual mode of Russian agriculture And the Rus sian peasants seem to prefer this to individual ownership which is spreading only slowly through the division of com munities and the purchase of land from the nobility and the mortgage banks While the effects of this radical change have not yet worked themselves out it is evident that it caused increased demands for mortgage banking facilities on the part of nobles who having lost their serfs were now compelled to adopt the West European mode of farming by hired laborers and who had in most cases their land already mortgaged to somebody t According to the Russian usage of the word soul it included only the male peasants paying the capitation tax fAnatole LeroyBeaulieu  Das Reich der Zaren Berlin 1884 p 349 I have not seen the original French edition of this excellent book tIn 1859 about fiftynine per cent of the land of the nobles was according to LeroyBeaulieu p 132 mortgaged to banks and the remainder often to private individuals 245 9798 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY And thanks to the mortgage banks now established and to the slow and quiet way in which the great reform was accomplished Russia escaped such a demoralization of its agriculture as that which the Southern States of the Union have but recently recovered from Before this time there had been but little organized mort gage banking done and the  souls or serfs rather than the land itself had been considered as the security Two banks were founded in 1754 making short term mortgage loans at six per cent They did not foreclose but took temporary possession of the property In I786 they were amalgamated with another bank to form the Imperial Loan Bank which made both city and country loans On lands it loaned at eight per cent three per cent of which formed a sinking fund to redeem the loan in twenty years On lots the rate was seven per cent with redemption in twentytwo years In 1797 another auxiliary bank was founded which lent from forty to seventyfive roubles per  soul the loans were made in five per cent twentyfive year bonds of the bank itself which the borrowers then had to sell This bank lent fifty million roubles of which only 1395000 were outstanding in 1802 when it was united with the Imperial Loan Bank The new bank wasunfortunately one would thinkper mitted to loan also its deposits on land In addition to this there were two concerns founded which were not for profit but to render aid where needed the Lombards of 1772 and the Establishment for Public Aid of I775 In 1841 the Imperial Loan Bank had a capital of 8581330 roubles in 1851 it held according to Hiibnert 344000000 Thaler Prussian and in I858 it had outstanding loans of 326000000 roubles Up to the Crimean War these were the only mortgage concerns of Russia proper and they were successful until J Dede  Das Russische Reich p89 tO

government had to come to their assistance by repaying a large amount previously borrowed In 1859 a commission was then appointed to study the question and for three reasons it recommended the forma tion of mutual associations first because it was supposed there would be a good market for the bonds of such associa tion secondly on account of the active control of their affairs by the borrowers who would be mutually liable and thirdly because it was thought that between such associa tions managed by the previous borrowers themselves there would be no competition and thus no temptation to make risky loans Such mutual associations similar to those of Germany had long been successfully operating in the Baltic Provinces and in Poland The credit associations of the nobility of Esthland and Liefland had been founded in I802 and I803 respectively when the Czar loaned them several million roubles at three per cent with which to commencet Furthermore in 1825 one had been founded in Poland with seat at Warschau similar also to the German Provin cial Associations and this as well as the preceding ones is still in successful operation The members are the pro prietors of country estates and are all responsible for the bonds which are given to borrowers when loans are made These bonds are redeemable in paper roubles and with the exception of one issue of which there was in 1890 out standing 37628 roubles at four per cent they draw five per cent interest The total amount outstanding in I890 at five per cent was II2267008 roubles The Credit Association of Kurland with seat at

founded were however the Kherson Provincial Bank of 1864 and the large Credit Association of St Petersburg founded in i866 The former lent fifty per cent of the value of the property with sinking fund

six months the property so obtained The bonds were redeemable in the course of fiftysix and onehalf years at 125 per cent by annual drawings The large scale on which this association was commenced made it an immediate success The amount of outstanding loans rose quickly to over a hundred million roubles and the five per cent bonds were sold by the Rothschilds and Bleich roeder in Berlin The borrowers obtained ninety per cent of the face of the bonds At first all interest and sinking fund installments were payable to the association in gold but as paper money fell in value this was found very difficult In 188182 members had to pay as much as seven and eighttenths roubles in paper for five roubles gold In 1884 the government there fore came to the rescue of the association agreeing to

from the loans of its special section outstanding loans of 39ooo000oo000 roubles and another bank for the peasantry founded in I883 which has loans outstanding of 49000000 roubles The former was by law of 1889 authorized to issue bonds with prizes as is customary on the continent of Europe where the lottery business is not regarded as in America and in 1890 there were eighty millions of prize bonds out standing at five per cent This bank had in I890 a surplus of 1292708 roubles The one for the peasantry had in 1891 a capital of 2807439 roubles but had already then had to assume prop erties to the amount of six million roubles It seems there fore too early to pronounce the vast mortgage loan business done by the Russian government an unqualified success The private mortgage banks however make an excellent showing These date from the period succeeding the pay ment of the French indemnity and are doubtless to be attributed to the thrifty Germans to whom Russia owes most of her commerce That of Kharkow was founded in I87I and nine otherst immediately afterward Each of these banks is limited to a certain district in such a manner that only two banks can compete making loans at any one point They loan up to sixty per cent of the valuation and can foreclose without redemption after three and onehalf months default which the borrower however can avoid at any time before the sale by

business of these banks increased very rapidly Some bad loans were made but the rise in the value of property from I870 to 1882 protected them In the decade from 1873 to 1883 they lost four and onehalf million roubles on foreclosures but since then have been loaning with greater care A complete list of dividends shows that although a large surplus has been accumulated by all they have still paid from seven to fifteen per cent The loans of any bank must not exceed ten times its capital and the banks have had to increase their capital accordingly from time to time They are subject to the

quoted at from ninetythree to ninetyfive per cent and excepting the period of the Turkish War they remained from then on at about this rate until 1885 In 1890 they were quoted at from 103 to I04 per cent Up to I885 the banks had issued almost entirely six per cent bonds and in January I890 twothirds of the bonds drew this rate A conversion to five per cent was effected that year and as the bonds were payable on giving notice the bondholders had to choose between receiving cash or five per cent bonds at par an operation by which two and onehalf million roubles per annum were saved for the bor rowers What also probably caused the bonds to rise after the fall of 1873 was the formation of the Central Mortgage Bank of St Petersburg in April 1873 in order to assist the smaller mortgage concerns that were unable to market their bonds at a fair price It had a capital of i6oooooo roubles of which forty per cent was at once paid in About onethird of the shares belong to the government Further payments on the stock were made in 1876 I877 and 1887 so that the capital is now fully paid in This bank makes no direct mortgage loan whatever itself it only issues bonds based on the bonds of the other con cerns which are then deposited with the National Bank The principal and interest of the latter bonds are payable in paper roubles the bonds of the Central Bank in gold and it has therefore constantly sustained losses caused by the downward course of paper money It paid in 1873 a divi dend of twelve per cent in 1874 IO45 per cent in 1875 I265 per cent and in I876 five per cent since then no dividends have been paid And as the government is to blame for the depreciation of the currency it was natural enough that it should come to the assistance of the bank in 253 105ANNALS OF THIE AMERICAN ACADEMY 1887 and pay in 3000000 roubles on its shares of the capi tal stock thus making them fully paid up besides refunding to the bank the actual loss sustained up to that time viz 3400 8o8 roubles The bank was however given to under stand that in the future it would have to operate entirely at its own risk The respective series of bonds of this bank are redeemable in the course of twentyseven and onehalf fortythree and onehalf and fiftyfour and onehalf years Of five and one half per cent bonds were in 1890 outstanding and known in Berlin 7 I92500 roubles and of five percent bonds 31 931000 roubles In I890 the five per cent bonds were quoted in Berlin at ninetythree per cent In 1894 it was finally decided to liquidate this bank After the market for the bonds of the smaller banks had become good it was no longer needed Its gold bonds will be converted into government bonds and the Russian gov ernment will take control of all its assets with the expecta tion of realizing perhaps only twentyfive per cent for the shareholderst The history of both the mutual and the joint stock mort gage concerns of Russia thus affords an illustration of the misfortune to a

private joint stock banks is likely to gain the day is difficult to tell The real test of the strength of a mortgage loan institu tion is perhaps the rate at which it can obtain money Up to the last conversion in I890 the private banks which for other reasons seem preferable show inferiority in this respect One cause probably is that when loans are made in bonds to be sold at the borrowers expense sufficient regard is not had to the effect of new bonds on the money market And another reason is that these banks have lim ited themselves to Russia alone as a market for their bonds At

CENSUS MORTGAGE STATISTICS OF I890 RECENTLY PUBLISHED AS A RULE THE RATE OF INTEREST ON MORTGAGES AS WELL AS THE RATE ON PUBLIC LOANS OF ANY COMMUNITY WILL INDICATE ITS ECONOMIC CONDITION BUT THE MORTGAGE STATISTICS PUBLISHED THIS YEAR FOR RUSSIA SHOW THAT WITH A STRAINED PUBLIC CREDIT AN INCONVERTIBLE PAPER CURRENCY AN IGNORANT POPULATIONF AN UNENTERPRISING UPPER CLASS AND THE ENTIRE ABSENCE OF A MIDDLE CLASS RUSSIA AS FAR AS HER MORTGAGE STATISTICS ARE CONCERNED STILL COMPARES FAVORABLY WITH THE UNITED STATES AS IN THE UNITED STATES SO ALSO IN RUSSIA IT IS THE RICHEST AND MOST PROSPEROUS

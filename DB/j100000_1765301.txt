j100000,Science,1765301,Among the Publishers,i300681,SCIENCE they seem smaller and since distant objects also seem smaller they will seem more distant There are two objections to this explanation 1 The accom modation is for the distance of the real object as is proved by the distinctness Why then should the object seem farther 2 Again distant objects seem smaller only because their retinal images are smaller but this is not so in the case under considera tion In justification of his view Mr Bostwick says that in monoc ular vision an object appears distant or near according as the eye is fixed respectively on something nearer than it or something beyond it I am familiar with the fact here referred to but in this case the appearance of greater or less distance is so imperfect that it can hardly be called estimate It may seem farther or nearer almost at will It is a matter of fancy not a sober cer tainty of rational judgment In fact there is no ground for form ing any judgment Although Mr Bostwick speaks of his estimate of the distance of the phantom as distinct yet I cannot but think that for want of complete dissociation of the axial and focal adjustments the image is not quite sharp and that if he got the same sharp realistic image which I get he would see the distance as I see it Of course there is no disputing about how things seem to differ ent observers any more than there is about tastes but neverthe less there are some things which are normal and reducible to intelligible law and some not Mr Bostwicks case may be ab normal but I think probably not I well know how illusive binocular phenomena are He will I am sure pardon me for thinking that with more practice in experiments of this kind he will come to see things as others see them JOSEPH LECONTE Berkeley Cal May 27 A Rain of Fishes DURING a recent thunderstorm at Winter Park Fla a number of fish fell with the rain They were sunfish from two to four inches long It is supposed that they were taken up by a water 335 spout from Lake Virginia and carried westward by the strong wind that was blowing at the time The distance from the lake to the place where they fell is about a mile THOMAS R BAKER AMONG THE PUBLISHERS MACMILLAN  Co have published a brief biography of the late English anatomist William Kitchen Parker written by his son T Jeffery Parker It begins with an account of his birth and early life on his fathers farm and then of his schooling and his apprenticeship first to an apothecary and afterwards to a surgeon With his strong inclination for biological studies it was natural that he should choose medicine as his profession but it is evident as indeed his biographer admits that he had no great love for his profession and only moderate success in the practice of it His prime interests in life apart from his family were two things not often found in conjunction at the present day science and Wesleyan religion and he seems to have been equally devoted to both and to have found no incongruity between the two In biology he was largely selftaught but a few discern ing friends saw that he was capable of important original work and assisted him in the prosecution of such work He became a member of the Zoological Society and afterwards a fellow of the Royal Society but the position that proved the most useful to him was the Hunterian professorship of anatomy and physiology in the Royal College of Surgeons because it not only gave him the opportunity to lecture on his favorite subjects but also added to his otherwise moderate income His principal scientific work his researches on the skull is described at some length in this book and there are briefer notices of his other studies and a bibli ography of all his published works His principal fault as a sci entific writer his son thinks was his complicated style his topics being arranged in a disorderly way and his sentences hastily constructed Yet biologists will doubtless echo the words of the Royal Society that he was an unworldly seeker after truth    whose beneficent influence will ever be felt in a widespreading and advancing science Exchanges Freeof charge to all if of

pronunciation and grammar Point out relations between French and English and generally draw the students attention to higher standards of knowledge By degrees as reading becomes easier and grammar drill can be relaxed and left dwell on stylistic and other literary merits When the lessons begin to be rather long to be rendered line by line into English read or have the class read the French alone asking for a translation only of uncommon words and difficult passages enough to control the correctness and earnestness of the students preparation And finally if you have a speaking command of the language be gin to speak French to the class as soon as it can be safely done without waste of time But do this only gradually where the class can follow you without wasteful explanations and do not as a rule require the students to answer in French because that means with ordinary classes and under ordinary circumstances frustrating the main purpose of your instruction for more trivial ends Valuable suggestions on the method of teaching French may be found in MAethods of Teaching Modern Languages addresses and articles by various instructors pp I85 60 cents  Heath  Co A H Edgren University of Nebraska Oct I894 THE CURRICULUM OF A SMALL HIGH SCHOOL In constructing a programme of studies for a small high school a very important consideration is the wellbeing of the teacher It is true of course that the school is not main tained for the sake of the teacher but it is likewise true that those communities that disregard the personal welfare of their teachers do not have and can not have the best schools In view of this it is not unreasonable as a preliminary to the discussion of the main proposition of this paper to ascertain and clearly state the conditions under which a teacher in a 268The Curriculum of a Small High School small high school may carry on his work in a normal and suc cessful manner My first thesis is that the teacher must not be overworked He must be a sturdy and persistent worker but he must not be overworked The schoolmaster who allows his nervous system to be upset and his spirits broken by carrying too heavy and unreasonable burdens commits a wrong not only against himself but also against his school No remunera tion is great enough to compensate a man for loss of health and no teacher whose blood lacks oxygen or whose nerve centres lack what Dr Hall calls  euphoria is qualified to in struct or train a healthy and vigorous youth The teacher should have time for abundant physical exercise in the open air and for such recreation as affords him needful rest and pleasure This is not only his right but his duty Children are as soft clay in the hands of a teacher who possesses an abundance of vitality and good nature But how many teachers in the village high schools of New England can even approximate such a condition  As a class they are seriously overwrought They spend their days in the most harassing kind of labor in the school room and their nights in tutoring some ambitious pupil or in preparing for the six seven eight or more recita tions that must be conducted the next day The debilitating effects of such a life are easily discernible No one should wonder that such teachers are nervous irritable and despond ent If young men of ambition and ability are to be induced to enter the small high schools and remain in them this stress and strain of overwork that depresses the spirits and impairs the health of conscientious and faithful teachers should be removed My second thesis is that the teacher in the small high school should have his work adjusted in such a way that he may thereby and meanwhile be making suitable preparations for a position of larger responsibility and more substantial re muneration Every good teacher is an ambitious one The small high schools secure a high order of talent and often 269The School Review the most efficient and skillful service simply because the wide awake teacher looks to the future and believes that transfer and promotion are sure to come to him whose work from day to day evinces both wisdom and fidelity In this view the small high schools are the training ground where men and women are prepared for more responsible duties and wider fields of activity in the larger centres of population Fortun ate for the small high schools that this is so and the com munities in which these schools are placed will consult their own interests when they see to it that the men and women who serve them so efficiently at small salaries shall have some reasonable opportunity to prepare themselves for the larger work that waits those who survive this period of their pro bation What then are the conditions under which a man teaching in a small high school may prepare himself for a larger sphere of school work and at the same time do the full measure of his duty to the school in which he obtains his preparation  The answer to this question is a twofold one The teacher should have time to acquire some breadth and accuracy of scholarship in the subjects which he attempts to teach and should have opportunity to study both theoretically and practically the prob lems of education and the most approved methods of instruc tion These two statements may be summed up in one  The successful teacher must be both learned and wise The teacher who is thoroughly saturated with his subject is the one to whom pupils listen with attention and respect He it is who wastes no time on nonessentials but puts the emphasis of his own instructions and his pupils efforts where it is most needed Mr Collar of the Roxbury Latin School on his return to this country after a somewhat careful study of the German gymnasium said in substance  The chief defect in our secondary schools is the poor scholarship of our teachers We American teachers he said do not know enough about the subjects which we profess to teach He might have added  nothing is so destructive to good scholarship among 270The Curriculum of a Small High School American teachers as the necessity of teaching half a dozen or more subjects on the same day or in the same year A curric ulum of wide range in a small high school inevitably pre cludes scholarly teachers Therefore since the good quality of the school is so dependent upon the scholarship of the teacher the most serviceable course of studies for such schools is the one which is carefully but rigorously limited in the number and range of the subjects to be taught Furthermore that a teacher who is hard pressed with the cares of the school and has a large number of subjects to teach can give any thing more than a cursory attention to the phi losophy of his work is out of the question The teacher should not only have time for observation and reflection concerning the phenomena that appear from day to day in the class room but he should have leisure also for careful reading and close study if he is to understand in any good degree the real significance of the work that he is attempting to do Men of course differ about this and there are some who go so far as to say that there is no such thing as a philosophy or science of education But all will agree I believe in the notion that those who direct the education of children and youth need to know something about the characteristics of human nature something about the different effects that a study of the several classes of subjects such as language literature history science and mathematics has upon the human mind and something about the form and nature of the civilization under which they live and for which their pupils are to be trained and instructed This is what I mean when I say that the truly successful teacher must be a wise man Such wisdom is not inherited and cannot be imparted it comes only from the attentive study and profound reflection of men of experience Of course ulti mate knowledge along these lines of investigation is not to be expected but we must all admit that real progress in educa tional science depends upon the successful prosecution of these three departments of study When we know what human nature is we shall agree as to the proper function of the school 271The School Review When we understand the effects of the several subjects of study upon the childs mind we shall know the best means of educa tion When we fully realize the essential qualities of modern civilization we shall be better able to judge of a pupils power to conform to it and thrive under it It may be urged that this study of the philosophy of education is more or less spec ulative and I admit it And still it is better to make slow progress by an uncertain light than to grope in utter darkness But however fundamental or important these problems may be the teacher of the small high school cannot be expected to give them serious attention so long as his time and strength are wholly absorbed in the work of the class room and in prepa ration for it Thus far an attempt has been made to present from the standpoint of the teacher some reasons why great care should be taken to restrict the number of subjects to be taught in a high school that has only two or three teachers It is believed that the same proposition can be maintained when presented from the point of view of the school and the community which the school serves It is manifestly better for a youth to study a few subjects with a good degree of ful ness and thoroughness than to study many subjects briefly and superficially The Committee of Ten report upon this point with no uncertainty On page 41 they say The fundamental conception of all the conferences was that all the subjects which make part of the secondary school course should be taught consecutively enough and extensively enough to make every sub ject yield that training which it is best fitted to yield Again on page 42 they say It is essential that each principal subject shall be taught thoroughly and extensively  If in a secondary school Latin is steadily pursued for four years that sub ject will be worth more to the pupil than the sum of half a dozen other subjects each of which has onesixth of the time allotted to Latin If every subject is to provide a substantial mental training it must have a timeallotment sufficient to produce that fruit I know of nothing more fundamental or valuable in the whole report than this It disposes in a sen 272The Curriculum of a Small High School tence of all sciences that can be taught in  14 weeks and throws overboard without ceremony all subjects that are studied only or mainly for information Subjects that yield interesting and valuable information but a small measure of training may be maintained as luxuries in large and well manned high schools but should be rigorously excluded from the small schools In a limited curriculum only those sub jects should be admitted that afford information and training since training is to say the least the equal of information as a factor in education It is interesting to note that only a few of the whole number of subjects contained in the four courses of study recommended by the Committee of Ten are to be studied less than a year If you except higher algebra and trigonometry which consti tute a group to be studied a year the subjects that are to be studied less than a year that is a half year are astronomy physiology meteorology geology and physiography When the instruction is based chiefly upon the text book these five sub jects just mentioned may also be classed with studies that are pursued for the sake of information and should not be admitted into the programme of studies of the small high school The objection to them is removed of course if the teacher has had special training in them and is prepared to direct his instruc tion  quite as much towards a training in the methods of log ical investigation as towards imparting information For obvious reasons anatomy physiology and hygiene may be rated as an exception to the general law just laid down if they have not been studied in the grammar school In the four sample programmes found in table IV of the report of the Committee of Ten it is instructive to observe that several subjects which often have a prominent place in the high school curriculum do not appear What are the sub jects that have been discarded by these famous decemviri They are civil government political economy psychology ethics logic drawing music elocution bookkeeping com mercial arithmetic and commercial law To be sure they B 273The School Review say by way of apology for such seeming disrespect that it must not be supposed that the omitted subjects are necessarily to be neglected and they go on to show how some of them such as drawing ethics metaphysics economics etc come in for incidental instruction but the significant fact remains that these subjects do not appear at all in their four sample programmes The obvious inference is that in the judgment of the Committee they have only a secondary educational value Although I have a special interest in some of these discarded subjects yet I believe that the Committee of Ten were wise in their decision to exclude them from their sample programmes President Eliot said in one of his lectures before the Lowell Institute a year or two ago that modern education is charac terized more and more by the efforts that are made to develop the power to do as well as to know the power to apply what one knows to new problems and new conditions In reading a foreign language without a vocabulary in solving fresh prob lems in algebra in working out original demonstrations of propositions in geometry in making observations and inferences in the field or laboratory in applying the canons of criticism to fhe masterpieces of literature and in writing out ones thoughts clearly and logically we have good illustrations of the processes by which the pupil develps power while he acquires new knowledge and culture Studies which develop the power to do as well as power to know should without question have the precedence in making up a curriculum in which the num ber of subjects to be taught is to be rigidly restricted We now approach the most perplexing problem of this whole discussion Should the high school that has only two or three teachers attempt to prepare boys and girls for college  There are weighty reasons both pro and con It must of course be recognized at the outset to use the words of the Committee of Ten that  the secondary schools ot the United Statee do not exist for the purpose of preparing girls and boys for college And yet there are benefits both direct and in 274The Curriculumz of a Small Hioh School direct that can come to a village high school in no other way In the first place it brings the teachers into contact with the college a contact that generates both heat and light in spiration and guidance When a teachers work is to be tested by the examination of a college expert or by the proficiency in study of pupils from his school who have been admitted to college by certificate he looks about himself as never before He now plans his work with his utmost care and skill scrutin izes every miethod to ascertain its efficacy directs his pupils efforts along the lines that are most productive and stimulates therm o their best efforts that they may win honor for them selves and distinction for the school in short he leaves no stone unturned to make his work sound and successful The good results of these activities of the teacher are felt in a large degree by all the school It may be urged that clearsighted and honorable men and women will do their best for a school without the aid of any such stimulus but any man of experience in the management of schools recognizes at once the unsoundness of this statement Again there are a few superior boys and girls in every village that may be saved to the higher education and prepared for careers of larger usefulness if the local high school furnishes an incentive and a preparation for it without expense And again if the village high school does not prepare its pupils for college the brightest and most ambitious boys and girls are frequently withdrawn and sent away to other schools This alienates the patronage and naturally the sympathetic support of the most influential families of the community and deprives the school of its natural leaders girls and boys who have inherited intellectual and studious tendencies and whose attendance would establish the confidence of the community in the school and exercise a beneficent influence upon other pupils who may be less richly endowed and less aspiring Furthermore to be able to send boys and girls directly from the local high school to college is a source of gratification to any community and this reacts to the advantage of the school 275276 The School Review especially when the graduates return from college and take their places as men and women among those who patronize and support the school On the contrary as I have said there are weighty reasons why the small high school should not expend its valuable time and strength upon a curriculum designed primarily for pupils preparing for college The greatest good to the greatest num ber is quite generally recognized as a sound policy in the management of public schools If there be one curriculum con taining Greek for the few who prepare for college and another for the many who do not even if the two curricula are iden tical in several important subjects justice cannot be done to the many while so much attention is given to the few Notwithstanding the great advantages incident to maintain ing a successful collegepreparatory course there are other and I believe greater advantages both to the community and teacher to be derived from a carefully planned and well sustained general course The possibilities in this direction are very great and may well excite the ambition of any teacher or enlist the enthusiastic support of an intelligent school committee Take for instance the study of English using the word in its broad sense to include the language the literature and practice in composition In each of the four sample pro grammes presented Iy the Committee of Ten there is a four years coursein English What an opportunity for a teacher who has a wide acquaintance with good literature and knows how to teach it  The intellectual stimulus and moral inspira tion that can be given to a school and through a school to a community by imparting to high school girls and boys a genuine and lasting interest in good literature are well worthy of the consecrated efforts of the most devoted teacher So too in directing pupils efforts in English composition the wise ef orts of the faithful teacher like the seed that falls on good ground  bring forth fruit some thirty some sixty and some an hundred foldThe Curriculunz of a Small Higlh School History too is made quite prominent in the sample pro grammes just mentioned In three of them it appears as a three years course and in the English programme as a four years course The great educational value of the proper study of history in the secondary school is more highly ap preciated every year and the methods of teaching it are im proving with great rapidity No study can be made more fascinating and none is more useful in training young men to meet their responsibilities as intelligent citizens of a free State To collect a working library of historical works so that pupils may to some extent have access to original and authentic sources of information to make a series of suggestive topics that shall comprehensively cover the periods to be studied to be well enough informed to indicate to pupils the best and various sources of information on important historical epochs to be able in dealing with historical data to cultivate the pupils power of careful and systematic inquiry and to es tablish in him the habit of logical inductive and deductive reasoning to do all this with wisdom and enthusiasm for a whole school is just as creditable and quite as productive of good to the community as to teach Greek to two or three girls and boys Likewise in physics and chemistry there are possibilities of effective training in quantitative laboratory work that must be abandoned if the teachers attention is absorbed in maintaining the traditional collegepreparatory course How much this laboratory work has improved in value during the last seven years under the leadership of Harvard college need not be recited here There are reasons for believing that this more accurate and therefore more effective method of quantitative experimentation in the laboratory will soon displace a part at least of the less accurate and therefore less valuable qualita tive laboratory work that now quite generally prevails A young man just entering upon his career as a teacher would make no mistake for himself or for the community which he serves if he should enter upon this new scheme of 277The School Review school work with a view of demonstrating its full value as an instrument of education The idea to be emphasized is this Such desirable possibilities as have been instanced in the de partments of English history and science that may accrue if the whole strength of the teachers be spent in developing one firstclass general course must be relinquished if Greek and the higher mathematics comprise a part of the curriculum and if the best efforts of the teachers be given to preparing pupils for college I must not be understood as decrying the study of Greek Far from it As an instrument of culture the Greek language has no superior As a means of interpreting the phenomena of modern civilization and correcting its evil tendencies Grecian philosophy and Grecian history are well nigh indispensable But in a secondary school of only two or three teachers that which appears to be a good thing for the few must sometimes be sacrificed for what is really the greatest good of the many The main propositions that I have tried to support thus far in this discussion are chiefly negative in their character and may be briefly expressed as follows The course of study of a small high school having only two or three teachers should contain a minimum number of subjects of study should exclude all studies that are pursued mainly for information should admit but few if any short courses should bar out Greek and the higher mathematics and should be framed primarily in the interests of the many and not for the few that go to college When we turn to the affirmative side of this question and attempt to show just what studies should be admitted to such a curriculum where each should be placed and to what ex tent each should be pursued fixing at the same time the number of exercises per week we not only enter upon the discussion of a subject about which wise men disagree but also of one that involves the greatest perplexities and uncer tainties In such a dilemma we may wisely and confidently follow the lead of the Committee of Ten Their four sample programmes represent the mature outcome of all their inves 278The Curriculum of a Small High School tigation thought and discussion and are well worthy of care ful analysis and comparison The first of the four is the so called classical course containing Greek and must therefore be set aside The third programme is characterized by the large amount of time given to German and French and for this reason would not generally be acceptable to New England people Having rejected the first and third our choice lies between the second the Latin Scientific and the fourth the English That the Committee believes the English course to be inferior to the Latin Scientific is evident from the follow ing excerpt from the report  The Committee desired to affirm explicitly their unanimous opinion that the two programmes called respectively Modern Languages and English must in practice be distinctly inferior to the other two The English course contemplates the formation of classes in Latin French or German prescribes trigonometry and higher algebra with no alternative and gives onefourth more time to English and onehalf more time to history than is demanded in the Latin Scientific course If the English programme were preferred it would have to be cut down to much smaller proportions and then would not differ essentially from the Latin Scientific course except that two foreign languages Latin and German or French are prescribed for the latter This fact alone makes me hesitate to pronounce in favor of the Latin Scientific course Is it practicable to attempt to require every pupil in the school to study two foreign languages  If this question can be answered in the affirmative I shall not hesitate to declare the Latin Scientific to be the most satisfactory general course that I have ever seen in print Of course a school having only two teachers can not afford the costly luxury of providing twenty exercises a week for its pupils as recommended by the Com mittee of Ten the number must be reduced to fifteen If there were three strong teachers in the school possibly the Latin Scientific course might stand intact with the proviso that some of the subjects be rated as electives But for a school of two teachers it seems necessary to exclude from the 279The School Review Latin Scientific course physical geography botany or zoology astronomy and meteorology trigonometry and higher algebra geology and physiography and to reduce somewhat the amount of time given to history and English Abridged in this man ner the Latin Scientific programme of studies would stand as follows FIRST YEAR SECOND YEAR Latin    5 p Latin    5 p English   3 p German or French  4 p Algebra    4 p Geometry   3 p History   3 Physics    3 p I5 15 THIRD YEAR FOURTH YEAR Latin    4 p Latin    4 p English    3 p English    2 p German or French 4 p German or French  3 p Algebra    2 p Chemistry    3 V Geometry   2 p History    3 p I5 I5 This scheme would provide an excellent general course and at the same time would enable the school to prepare boys for the course of study at Dartmouth college leading to the degrees of B L and B S a course leading to the degree of A B at Williams college a course leading to the degree of B S at Amherst college courses leading to the degrees of Ph B C E and M E at Brown University and a course at Wesleyan University leading to the degree of Ph B In like manner girls may be prepared to enter upon courses of studies leading to the degree of A B at Vassar and Wellesley and courses leading to the degree of B L at Smith and Mount Holyoke On account of the modifications in college requirements for admission made during the last three or four years a fairly comprehensive or satisfactory general course may be an accept able collegepreparatory course The time has happily come when a small high school can retain all the great benefits to be derived from preparing girls and boys for college and at the same time devote all the resources of the school to the 280The Curriculum of a Small High School training and culture of those who are graduated from the high school to enter immediately upon the duties of active life Edward J Goodwin Newton Mass THE MORAL PROBLEM IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM If the supreme test of life is the unintermittent adaptation of the organism to its surroundings then we must feel that in the intellectual life of man or in the existence of the institutions which embody his ideals critical opposition is a factor to be freely reckoned with as one of the forces tending to ensure the preservation of the fittest forms alone This applied to our public school system means that we recognize it as some thing flexible and adaptable not cast in any mould of rigidity but capable of adjustment as need may arise and as legiti mate criticism may point out But there is some criticism that is not legitimate or at least is not fair and scientific being based on misapprehension Such it may be safely said is the attack which has been made on our system of public schools as not only nonmoral in structure but positively immoral in its effects Such a charge is too important to be passed over lightly If true or if partly true we may look only for a future of national disaster and ruin such as history tells us is the inevitable result when right conduct is lost sight of by any people This much may be conceded to the criticism that the im plied demand is just Our schools must indeed be not only storehouses of prepared facts to which as to Mr Bellamys collective dininghalls children are to be sent to get their men tal provender they must be also places formative of character It is rightfully demanded that the places where our future citizens and mothers of citizens are being trained shall afford the certainity of the child obtaining the moral and ethical schooling necessary for good citizenship 28I

reclaim us for God and goodness Our author also cites Moses Mendelssohns remark that Judaism has no dogmas but he does not understand the exact sense in which Mendelssohn used the word dogma The author of Morgenstunden and Phddon was the very last person to be accused of thinking that Judaism is indifferent about say the existence of God and immortality It is not worth while following our author much further His use of choice passages from Rabbinic literature is occasionally such as has already long ago made us regret that the Rabbis had not been warned to talk seriously at the approach of a fool and in his eagerness to show up the ignorance and hypocrisy of German Rabbis he even stoops to make capital out of a friendly jest However having shown to his own satisfaction that the cause of Jewish suffering is to be found in Judaism and nothing else the remedy he suggests is of course for Jews to forsake Judaism and be merged in their Gentile environment Several times indeed he has occasion to point out that there are many born Jews that have abandoned Judaism and suffer from intolerance none the less but he does not seem to observe how this admission affects his theory that Judaism is the exclusive cause of antisemitism And the crowning point of his logic is reached when in the name of Justice he appeals to the Gentile world to promote the absorption of Jewry and so terminate Jewish suffering Why in the name of Justice if Jews alone are to blame for their sufferings  And why in the name of a moral ideal if our devotion to  Ethics  is at the bottom of all the mischief  A WOLF STEINSCHNEIDERS BIBLIOGRAPHY OF JEWISH HISTORY Die Geschichtsliteratur der Juden in Druckwerken und Handschriften zusammengestellt von MORITZ STEINSOHNEIDER I Abteilung Bibliographie derhebraischen Schriften Frankf a M Kauffmann I905 xii 90 pp 8vo 6 mark IN the year I850 appeared in Ersch and Grubers Realencyclopidie vol XXVII pp 357471 Steinschneiders article Jiidische Litera tur which is of fundamental value to the present day and is still the only scientific and critical exposition of this wide domain Since that time the author as we learn from the preface of the work under notice has devoted special attention to the historical side ofj82 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW this literature and made a critical study of particular periods and indi vidual phenomena in various books and essays At last after a lapse of fiftyfive years he has succeeded in presenting us with a complete bibliography of this branch of literature which possesses all the merits of all such works by our grand old man a complete mastery of the material a critical judgment free from personal bias a con sideration of all the literary sources bearing on the subject in addition to exemplary accuracy restrained brevity and terseness of expression Jewish literature is not very rich in historical works in the real sense of the word which is determined by various factors In the first place the historical sense although not absent the Bible is already history for the most partdoes not seem to have been present not even to the same degree as e g among the Arabians One has only to represent how such a great mind as Maimonides expressed himself slightingly over this branch of literature Then it is to be considered that since the last two thousand years our history has been a history of suffering bearing out the ancient dictum p IDDl D 1M INn 1 3I DtN That history should deal above all not with political but intellectual development and should consist not of stories of battles but of spiritual triumphs and those who achieved them is a discovery of quite modern times We can therefore understand why this latest work of Steinschneider which begins with the Talmudical period and goes down to I900 comprises only a little more than 300 numbers although the termini are pretty wide apart so that historical materials documents statutes reports c the history of individual personages and of scholars are all included The only thing excluded is the history of literature The first part now before us comprises only Hebrew works among which are also to be understood works in Hebrew characters Arabic Spanish JudeoGerman The nonHebrew works are to form a second part The author has been assisted in this first part by two of his former students A Marx of New York and A Freimann of Frankfort ontheMain In addition Fraulein Adeline Goldberg Steinschneiders trusty collaborator during recent years has been of valuable assist ance in the correction of proofs so that this work is dedicated to her  to the tried friend  der bewahrten Freundin The book begins with some introductory remarks on the historical Haggada  I3 to which Zunz as is well known devoted a chapter of his Gottesdienstliche Vortrage on the importance of the authority for fixing the Halacha  4 which became a motive for the history of scholars see the Chain of Tradition in tractate Aboth and on the legend  5 associated with Biblical and postBiblical personagesCRITICAL NOTICES 183 and contained in certain late minor Midrashim eg 5W WIVl W 12 Wv nv  r i ji ym tr t p Pw n w  mnts s wn c it should be added also the WIl tD c Then follows a description of the oldest chronologicalhistorical works of the Talmudical and Geonic period such as SVi 1TD  6 nryn nhn  7 Dnl13 1D tltr  9 W13N tOW1n l D  ii Eldad haDani  13 the Letter of Sherira  18 c The first real historical work in Hebrew is the Josippon so that the description of it is preceded by a short masterly characterization of the new points of view for the his torical literature to be considered pp 2628 then we come to a thorough description of this historical work  19 which Stein schneider like Zunz assigns to Italy in the tenth century In unbroken chronological sequence there follows an account of historical literature firstly of the middle ages  2090 the last mentioned work is the il1t V2W of Solomon ibn Verga then in an appendix  9I 92 various items with regard to the middle ages which one might look for in this bibliography owing to the information they contain eg David b Merwan alMukammas notices about Jewish sects Moses ibn Ezras poetry c We then reach modern times  93 3 I till 900o works of unknown period  312317 additions and corrections pp 172182 which are mostly due to Marx and Freimann and finally a list of titles pp 183I90 An index of authors editors and places is to be given in the second part for the entire work As the work under notice has the character of a bibliography absolute completeness is a matter of impossibility even for a Steinschneider This is especially true with regard to the most recent Hebrew literature which appears in all corners of the world and often escapes all bibliographical control Even here in Warsaw where most Hebrew printed books are published now it is impossible to follow all new publications let alone in the West It should therefore be the task of everybody who is interested in this branch of literature to provide supplementary lists I shall accordingly set forth here such a list however unimportant Of the middle ages I have only to add Sahl b Masliahs Hebrew introduction to his Arabic lawbook which Harkavy has edited in his Dnrn qlDD I no 13  pln 1879 cols 639643 and which contains many valuable notices about the condition of the Jews in Jerusalem in the tenth century see RE J XLVIII I54 Then a fragment of a travelstory by a Prince Jacob of Susa who is said to have visited the  sons of Moses beyond the Sambation between 1240 and 1276 and brought back

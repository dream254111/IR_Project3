investigators who will offer their services to the criminal courts in cases where the law provides for the assignment of counsel to the defendant who will undertake the voluntary defense of needy and deserving persons accused of crime and who will assist others engaged in like efforts 2 The FieldIn theory the law provides for the defense of every man accused of crime If when he comes up to plead to an indictment he has no lawyer and desires one the court is required to assign counsel to defend him without pay except in cases where the charge is murder in the first degree If he pleads guilty a probation officer is delegated to ascertain facts which will assist the court in determining the proper punishment So far as the statutes are concerned the poor man and the rich are equal in the eyes of the law In practice the theory does inot work out The law can provide for the assignment of counsel but can not provide counsel to be assigned The pro bation officer may do his best but he is an investigator not an advocate The prisoner having admitted his guilt overawed perhaps and disheartened as often as not foreign born and speaking no English can seldom adequately present his own cause to an officer of the law He needs some one to urge it for him In the daily grind of cases through the criminal courts it is seldom that the poor man gets a thoroughgoing defense 3 Why the Courts Find it 14ard to Assign Competent CounselMost lawyers in civil practice have neither the experience nor the equipment to handle properly a criminal case There is required both knowledge of the types of human nature involved and judgment as what the criminal courts and juries will do as to whether for example it is best to defend to plead guilty and trust to mercy or to go to the district attorney present the defendants case and ask for his discharge The essential facts both as to the crime charged and the life and surroundings of the man accused have to be dug out with great difficultyoften from most unpleasant soil This requires trained investigators who know the town and the underworld Few lawyers have such assistants at their command few are willing or able themselves to rummage the unpleasant places for facts and witnesses Not only because he is very loath to undertake the task but because he cannot properly cope with it the civil lawyer is practically exempt from such assignment Practitioners at the criminal bar of the type that a court likes to trust are unfortunately few in proportion to the number of cases to be assigned In 1915 in New York County counsel were assigned to 1495 persons charged with felony The defense of a criminal is a laborious and expensive task Naturally the courts hesitate to impose too much voluntary service on the few VOLUNTARY DEFENDERS COMMITTEE 278VOLUNTARY DEFENDERS COMMITTEE 279 available men and naturally they in turn are reluctant to accept more than a few assignments The average person has scant idea of the responsibility involved or of the cost in money time and toil of adequately representing a defendant in a criminal proceeding Often the very soul of a man is at stake He may by conscientious and painstaking effort be saved not only from jail but from himself and for society He may because of his lawyers carelessness or lack of resources ability vision or conscience be turned into a criminal for life 4 What Actually HappensA small group of a dozen or so lawyers make a profession of handling assigned cases They sit each morning in a conspicuous place in Part I of the Court of General Sessions where assign ments are made Usually it is only some member of this volunteer band who is available to a perplexed judge when he must assign counsel For the most part these lawyers do their work according to their lights Occasionally there develops among them a shyster who makes use of his assignment to extract cash from relatives or friends of the accused by means of dire tales of what will happen if money is not forthcoming to buy off wit nesses corrupt high personages or what not The judges however are on the alert to stop such practices and it is doubtful if the darker stories as to the evils of assigned counsel are true except in rare instances A real evil nevertheless is involved in a system which makes it necessary to assign cases to a man of this type As a rule he has no facilities to do the work He has no assistants or investigators sometimes not even an office He haunts the criminal courts by day and at night plods around in the weary task of seeking witnesses He has no easy time picking up enough pay cases to eke out a living The temptation to try to get some money for his supposedly gratuitous services out of the defendant or his family or friends is enormous A stimulus to do good work of course exists in the possibility that the news that he has been able to get a man off may spread and bring him a paying client In a hard case however where the prospects of acquittal are slight and the defendant is friendless it is only too easy to shirk the work to urge the defendant to plead guilty as a bargain for a light sentence or if he will not to give him only a perfunctory defense The whole situation was once graphically summarized by one of these practitioners in a frank appeal to the jury This man he urged has no lawyer I am only assigned counsel I get no pay My only reward is in heaven and how can I ever get there  To a man who takes assignments only in the hope that by now and then being able to beat the case he may fall into something remunerative the opportunity for real service to the individual and to the community is not even apparent To that community which is perforce in the city prison the daily dreary sight of these men working for nothing only because they are too un successful to work except infrequently for something is not exactly sug gestive of high ideals of justice No wonder the first offender looking back upon his offense through such an atmosphere gets a distorted idea of the administration of the criminal law and sees it only as an enemy to be beaten What most of all a guilty defendant really needs is the advice of a high minded lawyer He may well be saved from a life of crime by clearsighted counsel or plunged into it by sordid and selfish advice The number of second offenders is increasing with appalling rapidity In 1906 in New York County VOLUNTARY DEFENDERS COMMITTEE 27928 OUTRYDFNES OMTE out of 2543 convictions under indictments 648 or 21 were second offenders Ill 1915 out of 3728 convicted 1328 or 35 were second offenders Men who have been imprisoned in and spoken from the Tombs have asserted and there is much to support their views that second offenders are bred by criminal practitioners whose chief aim in defending a case is to get the defendant off at any price Of the 3728 persons convicted after indictment for felony in 1915 2737 were between 15 and 30 years of age over a thousand being between 15 and 20 Certainly every effort should be made to make it possible in all cases of young persons charged with serious crime to assign counsel who can be counted on to strive for something better than merely to beat the case whatever the means employed or whatever the guilt of the defendant 5 How the Poor Man Is SentencedFully as unsatisfactory are the available means for ascertaining what should be done when a needy defendant pleads guilty upon arraignment The court may talk with the complaining witness and the officer and then proceed to sentence The usual practice is to assign a probation officer to investigate Theoretically a probation officer is a custodian under whose care a convict may be paroled Practically a large part if not most of the time of the probation officer in general sessions is taken up in trying to find facts on the basis of which the judge can impose a proper sentence This confusion of functions makes a real probation system very difficult to operate About 50 of persons indicted are foreigners many of them can speak no English Upon pleading guilty such a man is confined in jail In any event he is most likely uncommunicative and fearful in the presence of a court officer If he had a lawyer who would take up the cudgels for him it would be different To get back into his life and surroundings to discount the tales of his enemies locate the causes of his downfallthis is no easy task and the probation officer strive as he may with the number of cases assigned to him cannot adequately fulfill it If a convicted youth comes of a family of means the most skilled lawyer is hired to present all the facts which may show that to release him might save him from a life of crime Except for what the probation officer may discover the poor boy as a rule comes unbefriended and with no one to speak for him to his day of judgment 6 Previous Attempts to Meet the NeedVarious plans have been tried and failed A wellorganized movement a few years ago resulted in presenting to the criminal court judges a list of fine spirited young lawyers who volun teered to take assignments Most of them took one or two and never wanted another and were not urged Individual judges have made brave efforts to draft wellknown lawyers only to give it up a little later discouraged The Legal Aid Society takes such criminal cases as come to it but its staff is far too busy with handling over 40000 civil cases a year to take assignments in the criminal courts The plan which has emerged from experience as most responsive to the need is not easily adaptable to and runs counter to some of the necessary principles of that societys other work There has been some agitation for a public defender but the idea has found little favor for reasons not necessary to elaborate here The recommendation of the investigating com mittees of the Lawyers and Bar Associations is to the effect that the need should be met not by the creation of one public office to contest with another the one representing the state and the other the individual but by volunteer effort 7 The Plan of This CommitteeSimply stated it is to employ pay and VOLUNTARY DEFENDERS COMMITTEE 280VOLUNTARY DEFENDERS COMMITTEE 281 direct the efforts of counsel who will volunteer to take assignments to defend the accused and to represent before sentence those who have pleaded guilty They will serve on a salary basis and receive no other compensation and do no other work They will be equipped with an office have the services of at least three trained investigators one of them a woman who will be selected in part for their ability to speak several of the foreign languages which are encountered It is planned to make this staff the active center of a large association of volun teer workers There are many lawyers both men and women who are ready to volunteer for work in the criminal courts under the advice and with the assistance of the committees staff Several physicians have offered to give their services when called upon The governor the district attorney and the judges have become interested in the plan and welcome its opportunities There will be when it is carried out no further need for assigning incom petent lawyers or professional assignment chasers 8 The Crucial QuestionCompetent AttorneysThe success of the whole plan depends on getting the right men as the salaried attorneys Highly paid and experienced lawyers are engaged as district attorneys to prosecute To pit against them young inexperienced or unsuccessful practitioners would be to defeat the undertaking at the very outset The voluntary defender should be not only a man of the highest character and of fine insight and sympathy he should know the whole game and be capable of going into a hardfought trial against the best of assistant district attorneys Any effort to go at the matter with inadequate resources and cheap or underpaid counsel would be foredoomed to failure 9 The AnswerThe committee is fortunate in having met its most dif ficult problem William Dean Embree now assistant district attorney in New York County has expressed his willingness to act as chief attorney He has served with eminent success and everincreasing ability and reputation under District Attorneys Jerome Whitman Perkins and Swann No one better fitted both in character and ability to undertake the task could be selected Associated with Mr Embree will be Timothy Newell Pfeiffer who was a deputy assistant district attorney under District Attorneys Whitman and Per kins and who is now the attorney for the American Social Hygiene Association Both these men are thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the undertaking and see very clearly the opportunities it offers for effective service to the com munity 10 The Dangers and Problems to Be MetThe Scylla of this enterprise is that it may be utilized by unworthy persons as a means of getting highly competent legal services for nothing The Charybdis is that in many assigned cases the defendant will be a crook who wants no honest defense but only to be kept out of jail by crooked ways The course between these two dangers will have to be felt out in detail as the work progresses It can only be roughly charted now The chief source of work will be assignments by the court At the outset it is not planned to take up cases on the application of the person accused The committees services however will be offered so far as possible to other institutions and volunteer workers who are interested in defendants and will vouch for the worthiness of the case Of course in assigned cases there will be instances where it will prove that the defendant is well able to employ counsel and is not worthy of volun VOLUNTARY DEFENDERS COMMITTEE 281282 CHILD WELFARE tary assistance The remedy will be to apply to the court to revoke the assign ment This can easily be done in a way that will not prejudice the defendant When avoluntary defender finds that he has a guilty man on his hands he will not set out to acquit him He will boldly face the problem of the defendants future career The first essential step towards improvement is a confession of guilt If the defendant refuses the advice the voluntary de fender may ask to be relieved from the assignment Usually the defendant will himself be prompt to find means to accomplish such a result If the assignment must perforce continue then the voluntary defender has it in his power to insist on legal proof of the defendants guilt and to keep him and his witnesses from committing perjury on the stand The really difficult case will be where guilt is apparent but stoutly denied even to counsel In such event the answer will have to be sought in the good judgment of the salaried counsel and the officers of the committee as applied to the peculiar circum stances of each case as it arises 11 How the Plan Is Being FinancedThe problems of putting this work on a successful and useful basis should not be complicated by a constant need for funds Consequently before starting the committee aims to provide to meet its budget for three years An appeal is being made now to relatively few individuals for assurances of support during that period When the enter prise has become established it is planned to put it on a permanent basis of a broad general appeal the work being one which ought to be supported ulti mately through a wide public interest rather than by the generosity of a few The committee will at that time probably resolve itself into some form of association with a large sustaining membership 12 The CommitteeThe committee in charge of the plan has among its members several men who have been assistant district attorneys in New York County and many others who in one way or another have had some practical experience with the problems involved Its membership is as follows Nathan A Smyth Chairman Raymond B Fosdick James Bronson Reynolds Chairman Alexander M Hadden Executive Board Mrs Learned Hand Richard M Hurd Treasurer Charles E Hughes Jr Timothy N Pfeiffer Secretary Walter S Kaufmann Mrs Francis McN Bacon Sam A

Dean Embree The Minnesota Legislature and Child WelfareOf the fortythree measures recommended by the Child Welfare Commission thirtyfive have been passed by the Legislature with but few unimportant changes The joint committee of the House and Senate to which was referred this proposed body of law recommended for passage all but two bills As num bered in the printed report these bills are numbers 10 and 37 The substance of bill number ten relating to the making of a single act of sexual intercourse a felony was covered by another bill which has passed the Senate but not as 282 CHILD WELFARE

legislation and of sociology may be directed with profit As a crime it is peculiar in that in several jurisdictions the defendant may prevent his being punished by marrying the woman in the case even after a verdict of guilty has been returned against him As a study of comparative legislation it is of interest in revealing the utter lack of uni formity among jurisdictions whose social conditions are essentially the same lTo the student of sociology it presents a pelpiexing problem as to what the ideal enactment on the subject should em body It is now thirtyeight years since an article on this subject appeared in the Criminal Law Magazine volume three 1882 Hence a reexamination of the statutory provisions and of some of the most significant decisions on the subject may be of interest I STATUTORY PROVISIONS Of the fifty jurisdictions comprising the fortyeight states of the Union Alaska and the District of Columbia thirteen have no statu tory provisions for the criminal prosecution of seduction as such In the other thirtyseven jurisdictions in which seduction is a crime have statutes covering this matter2 Seduction Defined Subject to the limitations and exceptions to be noted and discussed hereafter seduction as a crime may be defined as the act of a male person in having intercourse with a woman of chaste character under promise of marriage or by the use Del Fla Ida La Me Md

from abduction in that the latter involves a taking away of the person and from rape with consent in that the age of the female may be considerably higher and in some jurisdictions is immaterial Though in the strict sense of the terms a female may be seduced without being debauched or vice versa the crime of seduction as defined by statute necessarily includes intercourse 3 The statutes differ considerably on the various elements of the offense 1 Promise of Marriage In twentytwo jurisdictions an essential element of the crime of seduction is a promise of marriage on the part of the defendant 4 In New Jersey and Wisconsin a promise of marriage is necessary for conviction if the defendant be an unmarried man while in Arkansas and Mississippi the prosecution must show either a promise of marriage or a feigned or pretended marriage The provision in New York is similar The defendant must have promised to marry or make a false representation to the woman that he is married to her In other words in twentyseven of the thirty seven jurisdictions where seduction is a crime an unmarried man cannot be convicted of the offense except upon proof of a promise of marriage or a feigned marriage Of the other eleven jurisdictions six 5 provide merely that if a person shall seduce any woman of the character described the offense is complete In the other four of the eleven jurisdictions a verbatim copy of the words of the statutes must be given In Ala bama the statute reads Any man who by means of temptation deception arts flattery or a promise of marriage     In Georgia it is provided that If any person shall by persuasion and promises of marriage or other false and fraudulent means    In Colorado a promise of marriage is necessary if the female be past the age of sixteen but the offense is complete if one shall without such promise of marriage seduce    any unmarried female under the age of sixteen years In Rhode Island the signifi cant words are Whoever    by false pretenses false repre sentations or other fraudulent means procures   In jurisdictions wherein a promise of marriage is an essential element of seduction the courts are practically unanimous in holding that a promise to marry only on condition that pregnancy result from the intercourse is not sufficient to sustain a conviction 6 This view is defended by Justice Bean in State v Adams7 as follows Where 3State v Reeves 1889 97 Mo 668 10 S W 841 4Ala Ariz Cal Ind Kan Ky Minn Mo Mont Neb N Mex N C N D Ohio Okl Ore Pa S C S D Tex Va and Wyo Conn D Col Ill Iowa Mich and Wash

implied from her yielding to the solicitations of her seducer under his promise of marriage and the promise becomes absolute But when the seduction is accomplished by means of a promise of mar riage to be performed only upon the condition that the intercourse results in pregnancy no promise of the woman can be implied from such yielding and it seems to us the contract smacks too much of a corrupt and licentious bargain to fall within the statute How can it be claimed that a pure minded woman is led astray and her ruin accomplished under a promise of marriage which with her assent amounts to nothing more than a mutual agreement to engage in illicit relations so long as pregnancy does not result and which neither party expects nor intends shall be fulfilled except upon the happening of an event which may never occur However where the statute expressly covers seduction and says nothing about promise of mar riage such a conditional promise of marriage may be sufficient to convict 8 In jurisdictions wherein the statute is not confined to seduction under promise of marriage but expressly covers seduction it is interesting to note that the statute has been construed to be broad enough to cover practically every case of intercourse with consent The word seduce in such statutes is used in its ordinary legal meaning and implies the use of arts persuasions or wiles to over come the resistance of the female who is not disposed of her voli tion to step aside from the path of virtue    Any seductive arts or promises where the female involuntarily and reluctantly yields thereto are sufficient  Possibly criminal prosecutions for seduction in such jurisdictions may be based on mere lovemaking of a char acter which has been held sufficient to render one liable in civil cases for damages for seduction 10 2 Chastity of Woman The statutes punishing seduction generally prescribe that the woman seduced shall have been of previous ori previously chaste character 11 of good repute 12 of good repute for chastity 13 virtuous14 not unchaste 15 or not lewd and unchaste 16 In Rhode Island the woman must not have been a common prostitute or of known immoral character In five juris

Arkansas the statute expressly pro vides for the punishment of seduction and there is an obvious im possibility of seduction where utter unchastity exists Hence in Arkansas the Supreme Court has declared that In every prosecution for seduction the character of the seduced female is involved in the issue And character means in this connection not her general repu tion in the community but the possession of actual personal chast ity 18 It is quite obvious that in all jurisdictions where seduction is made a crime lewd women are not intended to be protected by the statute nor do the legislators intend that there shall be a reward for unchastity accorded to a class of adventuresses who may be expected to be swift to profit thereby 19 To hold otherwise would be to break down all distinctions between the virtuous and vicious and to place the common bawd on the same plane with the virtuous woman 20 3 Pregnancy In but one jurisdiction namely New Jersey the statute expressly provides that an essential element of the crime of seduction shall be pregnancy resulting from the act of the accused In all the other thirtysix jurisdictions the statutes make no mention of pregnancy 4 Age of Woman In twentyone21 of the thirtyseven juris dictions no maximum age limit as to the woman seduced is fixed by statute In Mississippi the woman must be over the age of eighteen years She must be under twentyfive in Texas under twentyone in eight states 22 between sixteen and twentyone in the District of Columbia under twenty in North Dakota and under eighteen in Arizona Illinois and Ohio In Colorado if the seduction be accom panied by a promise of marriage the woman may be of any age but if the seduction occur without such promise the female must be under sixteen In New Jersey the woman may be of any age if the accused is a married man but if he be single the woman must be under twentyone 5 Age of Defendant In thirtytwo of the thirtyseven jurisdic tions in which seduction is made a crime no restrictions as to the age of the accused appear in the statutes In South Carolina he must be above the age of sixteen years in Nebraska and Ohio he Ark Conn Ky Mich and Tex Polk v State 1883 40 Ark 482 1Per Strahan J in Patterson v Hayden 1889 17 Ore 238 239 21 Pac 129  Ibid Ala Alaska Ark Cal Ga Ia Mich Minn Miss Mont Neb N Y N C Okla Ore R I S C S D Va Wash and Wis Conn Ind Kan Ky Mo N Mex Pa and Wyo 147COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW must be over eighteen in North Dakota he must be over twentyone years of age In New Jersey if the accused be a married man no age is specified but if he be single he must be over the age of eighteen 6 Requirement that Woman be Unmarried In twentytwo juris dictions the statute expressly requires that the woman be an un married woman or female In New Jersey she must be a single female However in eleven jurisdictions 2 the statute speaks of any female while in Mississippi it applies to any woman or female child and in Rhode Island to any woman or girl In North Carolina the statute refers to an innocent and virtuous woman However as these provisions have been construed by the courts it is curious to note that where the statute requires that the woman be unmarried women who have been married have been held to be within the protection of the statute while on the other hand where the statute does not specify that the woman be unmarried it has been held that a woman who has been married is not entitled to this protection In South Dakota the words an unmarried female have been held to include a widow 24 and in Oregon a divorced woman is considered an unmarried female for this purpose 25 At the other extreme is the decision of the Supreme Court of Missis sippi that even though the statute does not specify that the woman be unmarried this element is necessarily implied 26 7 Seduction by Married Man The rule in thirtytwo jurisdic tions is that the seduction statute applies to any person committing the offense apparently regardless of whether he be married or single In North Dakota and Texas it is expressly provided that no person shall be convicted of seduction if at the time of committing the offense he was married and such fact was known to the woman In Virginia and Wisconsin the defendant may be either married or single but if he be married a promise of marriage is not an essential element of the crime In New Jersey if the defendant be single he cannot be convicted if under eighteen years of age or if the woman be over twentyone though no such limitations are made if the de fendant be a married man when he committed the act When the seduction is alleged to have been procured by a promise of marriage it is obvious that no conviction is proper if the woman knew at the time that the defendant was married 27 8

footnote 17 148SEDUCTION AS A CRIME part of one accused of seduction as a bar to the prosecution that the greatest variation in the statutes punishing seduction exists In twelve states 28 the marriage of the parties apparently at any time constitutes a bar to the prosecution In Alaska the same is also true of an offer to marry in good faith On the other hand no mention of marriage as a defense appears in the statutes of twelve jurisdic tions 29 Nevertheless on professed grounds of public policy and decency the Supreme Courts in Indiana and Michigan have held that no prosecution for seduction can be maintained after the intermar riage of the parties 30 But Kansas has declined to recognize such a defense in the absence of any statutory provision making it a bar to the prosecution 31 The rule in the remaining jurisdictions is that marriage or offer of marriage is a defense or works a suspension of punishment depending upon the good faith of the accused and the time when his offer of marriage is made In California the accused to escape conviction must marry the woman before the finding or filing of an indictment or information against him In Texas he must marry her before pleading to the indictment in which case he may be prosecuted for abandonment after seduc tion and marriage if he abandons his wife within two years after marriage An offer in good faith to marry the woman at any time before pleading to the indictment is made a bar to the prosecution if such offer be refused by the woman These defenses are not open however to one who was married at the time of the seduction A statutory provision in Texas for mere suspension of the prosecution for seduction on the intermarriage of the parties and its revival within two years in case of misconduct on the part of the defendant was declared unconstitutional 32 In Georgia the marriage must occur before arraignment and pleading and not otherwise and a bond conditioned for the support of the female and child if any for five years must be given or if the accused be unable to give bond the prosecution is merely sus pended until he lives with the female in good faith for five years In Arizona Missouri and New Mexico the marriage must occur before the trial In Arizona and New Mexico a bola fide offer to marry if rejected by the woman is equally a bar But in Missouri while the intermarriage of the parties

marry is ex pressly made no defense In North Dakota the marriage is a bar at any time before con viction while an offer in good faith to marry if made before the case is submitted to the jury bars the prosecution But a defendant who was married at the time of committing the offense cannot avail himself of these defenses In Colorado marriage prior to the judgment of conviction of the crime is a bar The same is true in Iowa though in case of marriage to escape prosecution followed by desertion the defendant is made guilty of a misdemeanor In Washington intermarriage before judgment stays the pro ceedings for three years during which time the prosecution may be revived in case of nonsupport or desertion In New Jersey if the accused be a single man marriage even after sentence ends the imprisonment of the accused In Arkansas and Kentucky the marriage of the parties suspends the prosecution In Arkansas such prosecution may be revived at any time if the defendant deserts or abandons the woman without cause while in Kentucky no such revival results unless the desertion occurs within three years after the marriage Corroborating Testimony Twentytwo jurisdictions will not allow a conviction on the uncorroborated testimony of the woman seduced or the statute provides that her testimony must be cor roborated to the extent required as to the principal witness in case of perjury In fifteen jurisdictions 33 however no such requirement appears to be made Punishment In nearly every jurisdiction seduction is made a felony and the accused upon conviction may be imprisoned for a maximum term ranging from one to twenty years But in South Carolina the offense is made merely a misdemeanor and in New Jersey a high misdemeanor II RECENT CASES That the crime of seduction is one of not infrequent occurrence is evident from a glance at the more recent volumes of the American Digest In the Decennial Edition covering the years 1897 to 1906 the paragraphs on the crime of seduction occupied 17Y pages while rape covered but 672 and seduction in its civil aspects but 7 This was true though seduction is not made a crime as yet in thirteen states and doubtless in most instances the wrongdoer was forced to marry the woman to escape punishment thus forstalling any criminal proceedings which may have been contemplated Alaska Ariz Cal Conn D Col Ga Ky Mich Mont N Mex N D Ore S D Wash and Wyo 150SEDUCTION AS A CRIME We may well imagine the increasing importance which would attach to this offense if the other thirteen states enact similar stat utes and if as we have found in twentyone jurisdictions the pro tection of the statute is extended to women of all ages Such a provision is not unlikely with the increasing demand for the protec tion of women and agitation for a single standard of morality Wit ness the socalled White Slave laws Furthermore we should not be unmindful in this connection of the gradually awakening conscience of society in favor of the protection of illegitimate children and against the humiliation and torture of centuries inflicted upon them for offenses not of their own commission What greater benefit it may be asked can be conferred by law on a nameless child than a name However there is an obvious danger in departing from settled legal doctrine in the effort to set matters aright in such cases III ANALYSIS OF ELEMENTS IN THE OFFENSE Stripped of the varying details which we have noticed in our resume of these statutes it is quite obvious that the main purpose running through them is to compel an unmarried man who has had intercourse with a virtuous woman under promise of marriage to keep his promise under penalty of going to the penitentiary an alternative which is doubtless often sufficient to give strength to weakening knees on the way to the marriage altar While marriage in such cases is doubtless a consummation devoutly to be wished by many of the parties concerned to say nothing of the welfare of those yet unborn is it the proper function of a criminal court to compel the specific performance of a contract of marriage or of any other contract It takes us back nearly a hundred years to the flourishing days of the ecclesiastical courts in England to find any suggestion of the specific performance of a contract of marriage in a court with equity jurisdiction 34 Should the primary purpose in the enforcement of criminal law be prevention and reparation so far as possible just as the function of imprisonment is ceasing to be punitive and becomes more and more merely correctional If so how far should the doctrine be carried Are there any other contracts or crimes in which a similar course might be pursued with profit In so far as contracts of personal serv ice are concerned the United States Supreme Court is apparently un willing to have a laborer confronted with the alternative of fulfilling his contract or going to jail 35 As to reparation as a bar to criminal proceedings it is obvious that no reparation is possible in homicide But as to crimes against property would it be advisable to provide expressly by statute that for example a defendant who has Fry Specific Performance of Contracts 3rd Am ed 1884 917 Bailey v Alabama 1911 219 U S 219 31 Sup Ct 145 151COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW been indicted for stealing a sum of money may escape punishment by paying back to the injured party the sum in question one two or threefold While it is true that in our metropolitan centers the overburdened prosecuting attorney is generally willing to drop prose cutions in such cases if the injured party consents in more sparsely settled communities there are numerous instances of this character in which the prosecutor insists on going ahead with the criminal pro ceedings even though the injured party has forgiven and forgotten the offense and is even opposed to further prosecution In such com munities a statute of this character would effectually tie the hands of an overzealous prosecutor and would doubtless cause restitution in many cases As to the necessity of a promise of marriage 36 as the inducement to the consent of the female there is good reason for such a restric tion To make seduction eo nomine a crime without attempting to define the term is to cast us on a sea of uncertainty as to the meaning of a word which was quite indefinite and not clearly defined at com mon law It is broad enough as we have seen to include prac tically every form of lovemaking accompanied by intercourse and it may be seriously doubted if such conduct should be visited with im prisonment in the penitentiary regardless of the age of the parties unless society is prepared to make all sexual offenses felonies The limitation of the protection of the statute to virtuous women 37 and the requirement of corroboration of the testimony 38 of the women appear to place restrictions which are necessary and desirable upon this class of prosecutions However it may be doubted if these have always had the desired effect Even though a woman has fallen yet if at the time of the seduction she has reformed she has been shielded by the statute39 In such cases it has been said that she may have the virtue of chastity not in the high degree of the woman who has not strayed but yet within the meaning of the statute entitling her to protection 40 As to the corroborating testi mony it seems that it need be merely such as in the nature of the case is obtainable and may even be circumstantial and apparently slight in character 41 The requirement that pregnancy42 result from the seduction is inserted as we have seen only in the statute of New Jersey Un questionably in a large percentage of cases pregnancy has been the sole cause of the prosecution But should it be made an essential element of the crime If the primary purpose of the statute is the 6 See supra p 145 7 See supra p 146 38See supra p 150 39State v Carron 1865 18 Iowa 372 4See supra footnote 17 4 State v Lockeby 1892 50 Minn 363 52 N W 958 2See supra p 147 152SEDUCTION AS A CRIME protection of the offspring this requirement in New Jersey is no more than fair The objection to it appears to be the great difficulty in proving pregnancy particularly in its early stages43 Moreover it might prevent prosecution until the advanced stages of pregnancy when the latter element could be proven readily thus giving to the woman far less redress As to the age of the woman44 seduced we have seen that in certain jurisdictions the maximum age of the woman is fixed at a point but little beyond that in the statutes punishing rape with con sent With the tendency of recent years to raise the age of consent in the case of rape would it not be logical to remove entirely the limitation as to age as the law now stands in twentyone jurisdictions or at least to raise it to the age of twentyfive as in Texas Where as in Kansas the age of consent in case of rape is eighteen years and the maximum in seduction is twentyone the statute as it stands is of little consequence As to marriage or an offer to marry45 as a bar to the prosecu tion we have found a great diversity of language What can be said as to the wisdom of such provisions According to one writer No feature of these seduction statutes renders them more dangerous than that which provides that the defendant may by marrying the prosecutrix after conviction escape the penalty of imprisonment The jury are by this provision induced to render a verdict which they would hesitate to render if imprisonment would certainly follow by the consideration that after all even if they do convict the de fendant may as an alternative from going to prison in homely phrase marry the girla reparation which they think he ought to make if guilty 46 This objection could be met in part at least by the requirement which we have found to exist in some jurisdictions namely that the marriage to be effective as a bar be contracted be fore the beginning of the trial Even in jurisdictions which do not expressly make marriage a bar it doubtless has this effect in many instances not merely because of the indulgence of the prosecutor but because of the fact that the woman cannot thereafter be compelled to testify against her husband Space forbids a discussion of the merits and demerits of fixing the time when the marriage must take place in order to be a bar There are several possibilities for instance prior to the filing of the indictment prior to pleading to the same before the trial or before conviction In an ideal enactment should the marriage suspend or forever bar the prosecution It has been contended that suspension is prefer 43See 1882 3 Criminal Law Magazine 344 44See supra p 147 45 See supra p 148 4 1882 3 Criminal Law Magazine 343 153COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW able to a bar in such cases 47 However at the present day in view of the many and ingenious devices both civil and criminal invented by our legislators and courts for the purpose of compelling men to support their wives it may be that the woman is adequately protected by virtue of the fact that she is a wife and it may be advisable not to dig up after marriage the old charge of seduction In other words in the witty language of counsel should not the charge of seduction on de bene esse be forever cancelled by a marriage nunc pro tunc48 As to an offer of marriage as the equivalent of marriage actually contracted we have seen a great divergence of provisions Should not the offer in good faith be the equivalent of marriage The question is not purely academic In numerous instances the woman seduced has refused to marry her seducer preferring the satisfaction of seeing him go to the penitentiary to a name for her child 49 The marriage of the parties is the purpose intent hope and spirit of the statute Within its keeping the past misery and shame may be for gotten the future happiness of both secured Although the seducer be forced almost to the very doors of the penitentiary before offering to fulfill his promise of marriage yet having done so in good faith and his offer having been declined by his victim he can do no more The woman and not the man defeats the object and purposes of the law 50 Is not the broken promise the gravamen of the offense Where seduction has been accomplished under a bona fide promise of marriage and the man offers to fulfill his promise can he properly be said to be guilty of seduction 51 IV CONCLUSION In conclusion it is worthy of note how much more serious is the offense of seduction in most jurisdictions today than at common law In former days it was but a tort subjecting the seducer to liability in damages to the parent as master of the girl seduced and even this civil liability was hedged about with innumerable and absurd technicalities which prevented the recovery even of damages in many atrocious cases Today we find a large number of jurisdictions sending to the penitentiary the offender who went scot free at com mon law Does the man who marries the woman seduced to keep out of the penitentiary entirely escape punishment Much of course will depend on each individual case Yet many an accused however much atonement there may be for the woman in marriage doubtless feels himself between Scylla and Charybdis H W HUMBLE UNIVERSITY 0F KANSAS LAW SCHOOL 7 1903 17 Harvard Law Rev 63

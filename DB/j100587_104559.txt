LOOKING OUT AT WINDOW WAS SURPRIZED TO FIND AN UNUSUAL CLEAR SKY EVERYWHERE EQUAL TO WHAT IS OBSERVED IN FROSTY WEATHER OR AFTER A HIGH WIND EXCEPT THAT IN A FEW PLACES SOME THUNDERCLOUDS SHEWED THEMSELVES JUST ABOVE THE HORIZON AT 2 WE HEARD THUNDER AT A DISTANCE AT HALF AN HOUR PAST 3 WHEN I GOT UP I PERCEIVED THE STORM APPROACHING APACE FROM THE SOUTH WHERE THE WIND THEN WAS BUT THE DARKER CLOUDS SEEMED TO BEAR OFF E E E CHIEFLY384 CHIEFLY TO THE EAST AND WEST OF US SO THAT I DID NOT THINK WE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY MISCHIEF NEAR US AT 4 WE HAD A SMART SHOWER OF RAIN AND ABOUT 5 TWO LOUD CLAPS OF THUNDER OVER OUR HEADS BUT PRETTY HIGH THE LIGHTNING WAS VERY PALE AND THE FLASHES LARGE DESCENDING IN A SPIRAL FORM ALMOST PERPENDICULAR TO THE HORIZON TO THE EASTWARD OF US WHICH IS THE

VERY INCONSIDERABLY UPON HEARING TWO HOUSES WERE DAMAGED SITUATE AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL ON WHICH THE MINERAL WELLS ARE FRONTING THE EAST BY THE WOODSIDE I WENT NEXT DAY TO VIEW THEM THE HOUSE TO THE SOUTH WHICH IS A PUBLIC HOUSE KEPT BY MR HOWARD SEEMD TO HAVE RECEIVED THE GREATEST SHOCK SOME OF THE FA MILY BEING UP THE FRONT DOOR STOOD PARTLY OPEN WHEN THE STORM BEGAN THE UPPER HALF WAS OF GLASS FRAMD LIKE A SASHWINDOW HAVING TWO SLIDING SHUT TERS ONE ON EACH SIDE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN DOWN THE GLASS BETWEEN THEM WAS SHATTERD TO PIECES BUT THE SHUTTERS NOWAYS TOUCHD EXCEPT THAT A NAIL IN ONE OF THEM WAS FORCD IN A LITTLE WAY TO THE DOORPOST ON THE LEFT HAND HUNG BY AN IRON PIN AN IRON BAR WHICH SERVED TO FASTEN THE DOOR AT NIGHT THIS PIN WAS DRIVEN OUT OF THE POST AND THE BAR CONSIDERABLY BENT AND IN DIVERS PLACES MELTED IN SMALL SPOTS AS WERE THE HINGES OF THE DOOR CHIEFLY UPON THE EDGES IN BOTH AND THE DOORPOST SPLIT A SHEET OF LEAD ON THE PEDIMENT OR SHEL TER OVER THE SAID DOOR WAS RAISED AND PARTLY ROLLED UP385 UP AT ONE CORNER THE CORNICE UNDERNEATH BEING TORN OFF WITHOUT BEING SPLIT A GOOD PART OF THE TILE ING NEAR THE EAVES AND OVER THE PEDIMENT WAS LOOSENED AND SOME TILES BEAT OFF AND THE LATHING AND SOME OF THE MOLDINGS OF THE WINDOWS HAD TAKEN FIRE IN A BEDCHAMBER FRONTING THE ROAD ON THE SE COND FLOOR WHERE MR HOWARD LAY THREE BOARDS OF THE LINING OF THE ROOM ON THE EAST SIDE WERE DRIVEN INWARDS FIVE OR SIX INCHES AT ONE END BUT AT THE OTHER THE NAILS WERE A LITTLE LOOSENED ONLY IN A GARRET OVER THIS BEDCHAMBER THE UP PER PART OF A BEDPOST WAS SHIVERD AND NEARLY OVER WHERE THIS BED STOOD A LARGE HOLE WAS BROKE IN THE ROOF ON THE WEST SIDE JUST BY WHERE ONE OF THE CHIMNEYS GOES UP THE CHIMNEYS HAVING ALL ADDITIONAL FUNNELS OF BRICKWORK ON THE TOP OF A ROUNDISH FORM AND PLASTERD THESE WERE STRUCK AND IN CLIND TO THE NORTH ESPECIALLY THAT WHICH WAS ON THE SOUTH END OF THE HOUSE THE PLASTER BEING BEAT OFF AND SOME OF THE BRICKS BROKE DOWN THERE WERE ABOUT 13 PERSONS IN THIS HOUSE NONE OF WHICH RECEIVED ANY HURT THO A LAD WHO WAS IN THE KITCHEN INTO WHICH THE DOOR OPEND BEFOREMEN TIOND AND THE WINDOW OF WHICH NEAR WHERE HE WAS STANDING HAD SEVERAL PANES OF GLASS BROKE MUST CERTAINLY BE MUCH EXPOSED HE INFORMD ME AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT THE FIRE FLEW ABOUT HIM IN SPARKS LIKE THOSE WHICH FLY OUT OF BURNING CHAR COAL BUT LARGER AND SNAPPING AS THEY DO SOME PIECES OF GLASS WERE SHEWED ME WHICH I FOUND TO HAVE BEEN MELTED ONE OF WHICH I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF LAYING BEFORE YOU E E E 2 THE386 THE ADJOINING HOUSE INHABITED BY MR FIGGINS HAD THE PLASTERING BEAT OFF IN THE FRONT IN PATCHES AND ONE OF THE CHIMNEYS CRACKD FOR A GREAT LENGTH IN THE KITCHEN WINDOWFRAME ONE OF THE CROSS PIECES NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDOW HAD A CHIP STRUCK OFF FROM IT ABOUT 5 INCHES IN LENGTH AND AT ONE END ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH THICK BUT THIN AT THE OTHER AND NEAR THE WIDTH OF THE FRAME BUT NONE OF THE GLASS BROKE NOR THE LEAD BENT THO IN A MANNER CONTIGUOUS WITH THE SPLINTER BEAT OFF THE SAME THING HAPPEND TO A PARLOURWINDOW ON THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE BOTH THE SHIVERS WERE FOUND DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO THE WINDOWS AT TEN OR TWELVE YARDS DISTANT IN THE ROAD IN A SMALL GARRET WHICH IS NEXT TO MR HOWARDS HOUSE WHERE TWO MAIDSERVANTS LAY THE PLAISTER WAS BROKEN TO APPEARANCE INWARDS ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM AND NEAR THE FEET OF THE BED WHICH STOOD ON EACH SIDE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A YARD FROM THE WALL THE BREACH ON THE EAST SIDE NEAR A WINDOW SOME PANES OF THE GLASS OF WHICH WERE BROKEN WAS OPPOSITE TO THE VAILINGS OF THE BED WHICH WERE SINGED AND A HOLE BURNT THRO THEM BIG ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THE END OF ONES FORE FINGER ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE JUST BY THE CHIM NEY ANOTHER BREACH WAS MADE OF THE SAME HEIGHT IN THE WALL WHICH WAS CONTINUED DOWNWARDS FOR ABOUT A YARD BUT THE CURTAINS NOT AT ALL SINGED DIRECTLY AGAINST THIS BREACH ONE OF THE MAIDS WHO HAD GOT UP SAT ON THE BEDS SIDE WHO WAS INSTANTLY STRUCK DOWN BUT RECEIVED NO HURT UPON ENQUIRING OF HER WHETHER SHE SEEMED TO RECEIVE A BLOW ON ANY387 ANY PARTICULAR PART OF HER BODY SHE REPLIED SHE WAS STRUCK ALL OVER ALIKE BUT THE MOST REMARKABLE THO THE LEAST TERRIBLE EFFECT APPEARED ON THE FRAME OF A PANNEL OF WAIN SCOT ABOUT FIVE FEET LONG AND ABOUT ONE AND A HALF WIDE IN THE PARLOUR FRONTING THE EAST ON THIS PANNEL A LANDSCAPE IS PAINTED AND THE MOULD ING BELONGING TO IT HAD BEEN GILT BUT ON THE LAST PAINTING THE ROOM THE GILDING WAS COVERD WITH THE SAME PAINT THAT WHICH COVERD THE GILT MOULD ING WAS STRIPPED OFF IN IRREGULAR RAGGED STREAKS THROUGHOUT SO THAT THE GILDING APPEARED AS FRESH AS IT MAY BE THOUGHT TO HAVE LOOKD WHEN IT WAS PAINTED AT FIRST AND AS THE GILDING DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED SO NEITHER DOES THE PAINT AP PEAR TO HAVE BEEN CRACKD ANY WHERE BUT WHERE THE GILDING LAY UNDER IF IT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE LEAD IN THE PAINT WAS MELTED BY THE LIGHTNING IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO AC COUNT FOR IT THAT IT SHOULD NOT AT ALL AFFECT THE PAINT CONTIGUOUS WITH THAT WHICH WAS UPON THE GILDING THO WE SUPPOSE A RESISTANCE TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE LEAFGOLD AND TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PRODUCING THE MENTIOND EFFECTS BUT FEAR ING I HAVE BEEN ALREADY TOO PROLIX I ASK LEAVE TO SUBSCRIBE MYSELF WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT TOOTING JUNE 23 1748 S I R YOUR AND THE ROYAL SOCIETYS MOST HUMBLE AND MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT H MILES

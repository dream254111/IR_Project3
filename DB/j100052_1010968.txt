Limited Imported by Charles Scribners Sons New York I905 338Book Department This book contains a social study of Japan from the point of view of an engineer who spent ten years in Japan and to whom Japan very greatly owes her wellorganized system of engineering education From beginning to end the progressive power of the engineer is kept in view He says of his friends in Japan They see that the engineer is the real revolutionist for his work changes social and economic conditions and brings forces into action which are more powerful than anything which can be done by mere legislation The author states that his purpose has not been to give a history of modern Japan or detailed statistics of recent developments    it has rather been to indicate the forces which have been at work in bringing about what is admitted to be the wonder of the latter half of the nineteenth cen tury namely the rise of Japan as a member of the comity of nations and to note some of the chief results As preparatory to his discussion Mr Dyer describes the work of the Imperial College of Engineering He then discusses the fall of feudalism in Japan the Japanese mind the transition education in old and new Japan the army and navy means of communication industrial developments art industries commerce the food supply colonization and emigration consti tutional government administration finance international relations foreign politics and social results The book closes with an outlook upon the future of Japan and a supplementary statement of recent events There are also short appendices one bibliographical and a brief index He makes special mention of Captain Brinkleys work on China and Japan and considers valuable for reference the files of the daily newspapers published in English in Japan particularly the Japan Daily Mail and the Japan Times The book is interesting modern and very thoughtful having the out look of a man of scientific training who is yet conscious of the deeper cur rents of individual and racial life He states the problem of the future thus  How best to take full advantage of all that is good in Western civilization while retaining the special

a strong protest against race prejudice wherever found Nat urally his illustrations which are very numerous are drawn from our own American life It is written in popular form and will interest and

New York G P Putnams Sons 9o06 The author has prepared a text book of rather unusual scope which promises to be of considerable value It is in no sense an original study but is based upon works of others In the bibliography of works used in compiling the notes  only titles of books in English are given which would seem to indicate that the great historians of Germany and the rest of Europe 340 142Book Department Were ignored A short outline is given of the history of the various nations from Egypt Chaldea Greece and Rome down to all modern European nations China is included among the nations of ancient times but the authors treatment of modern China is too brief to amount to anything Ten good maps accompany the text Raper C L Principles of Wealth and Welfare Pp xii 336 Price IIO New York Macmillan Co 90o6 This book is an elementary exposition of economics for use in high schools One suffers no disappointment therefore in finding that a small volume so designed contains little that is new save the language illustrations and order of treatment The author seems to regard economics as the science of means to an endthe means being wealth and the end welfare though of course he is careful to point out that there are also other means to the same end There are three main divisionswants consumption which give rise to ef forts production which are recompensed by the returns distribution that satisfy wants Under the head of production the author describes at greater length than is usual the different groups of producers thus empha sizing in a striking manner the fact that commerce and transportation to gether with governmental activities are productive in an economic sense along with farming mining and manufacturing In explaining the distribu tion of wealth the productivity theory is employed It appears to the reviewer that the author fails to put in a clear light the principle of decreasing returns in relation to land pp 87 88 His first illustration is certainly a case of soil deterioration under exploitative methods of culture rather than a case of decreasing returns as that phrase is commonly used in economics The deterioration of the soil has no rela tion to the principle of decreasing returns In fact successive periods of time are no necessary part of the concept and in case such periods of time enter into any illustration of the concept as they so often do to the con fusion of the pupil care needs to be taken to emphasize the fact that the principle has reference to the net and not to the gross productsthat is to say it refers to the products left over after any soil depletion has been restored The best part of this volume is found in its descriptions as description is ordinarily understood however in the higher realm of description where description resumes under the briefest formulae the widest range of facts the work is not strong It is next to impossible to write a satisfactory text for beginners as for others in so difficult a field as economics It is too much to say that Professor Raper has thoroughly succeeded in doing the impossible However it is not too much to say that he has written a text that may serve the useful function of introducing the great problems of our industrial life to high school students many of whom are destined never to get the more advanced economic training that is so much needed as a preparation for intelligent citizenship 341 143The Annals of the American Academy Sakolski A M The Finances of American Trade Unions Pp 152 Johns Hopkins University Studies in History and

Cambridge Modern History very properly indeed one might say inevitably bears the name of the man who by his single per sonality and genius completely dominated the years it treats Not even a Caesar a Charlemagne or a Louis XIV was so entirely the architect of his fortunes or the princecreator of his power throughout so vast a region as was the little Corsican upstart These are sentiments expressed by the editors with which students of history will in the main agree and we have a right therefore to expect in this volume that unity which the character and continuity of the great Napoleonic tragedy stamp upon the period The volume falls into twentyfour chapters contributed by sixteen authors of whom five are foreigners The subjectmatter includes the history from the beginning of the Consulate in 1799 to the close of the exile at St Helena From this it is apparent that this volume is not intended to cover all the career of Napoleon The early life and the particular cir cumstances underlying his rise are treated in the volume on the French Revolution likewise the brilliant campaigns in Italy and Egypt the over throw of the Directory and Bonapartes usurpation fall outside the limits of the present volume On the other hand that great diplomatic prologue to the international history of the nineteenth century the Congress of Vienna in which the nations of Europe for the first time met to settle the troublesome affairs of international politics by peaceful deliberations and laid the basis for the political conditions of Europe for decades is included It requires no demonstration therefore to show that the title of the volume is misleading and inaccurate The editors would have done well if 342 I44

NEW YORK MACMILLAN CO 90O6 THIS BOOK IS AN ELEMENTARY EXPOSITION OF ECONOMICS FOR USE IN HIGH SCHOOLS ONE SUFFERS NO DISAPPOINTMENT THEREFORE IN FINDING THAT A SMALL VOLUME SO DESIGNED CONTAINS LITTLE THAT IS NEW SAVE THE LANGUAGE ILLUSTRATIONS AND ORDER OF TREATMENT THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO REGARD ECONOMICS AS THE SCIENCE OF MEANS TO AN ENDTHE MEANS BEING WEALTH AND THE END WELFARE THOUGH OF COURSE HE IS CAREFUL TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER MEANS TO THE SAME END THERE ARE THREE MAIN DIVISIONSWANTS CONSUMPTION WHICH GIVE RISE TO EF FORTS PRODUCTION WHICH ARE RECOMPENSED BY THE RETURNS DISTRIBUTION THAT SATISFY WANTS UNDER THE HEAD OF PRODUCTION THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES AT GREATER LENGTH THAN IS USUAL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PRODUCERS THUS EMPHA SIZING IN A STRIKING MANNER THE FACT THAT COMMERCE AND TRANSPORTATION TO GETHER WITH GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES ARE PRODUCTIVE IN AN ECONOMIC SENSE ALONG WITH FARMING MINING AND MANUFACTURING IN EXPLAINING THE DISTRIBU TION OF WEALTH THE PRODUCTIVITY THEORY IS EMPLOYED IT APPEARS TO THE REVIEWER THAT THE AUTHOR FAILS TO PUT IN A CLEAR LIGHT THE PRINCIPLE OF DECREASING RETURNS IN RELATION TO LAND PP 87 88 HIS FIRST ILLUSTRATION IS CERTAINLY A CASE OF SOIL DETERIORATION UNDER EXPLOITATIVE METHODS OF CULTURE RATHER THAN A CASE OF DECREASING RETURNS AS THAT PHRASE IS COMMONLY USED IN ECONOMICS THE DETERIORATION OF THE SOIL HAS NO RELA TION TO THE PRINCIPLE OF DECREASING RETURNS IN FACT SUCCESSIVE PERIODS OF TIME ARE NO NECESSARY PART OF THE CONCEPT AND IN CASE SUCH PERIODS OF TIME ENTER INTO ANY ILLUSTRATION OF THE CONCEPT AS THEY SO OFTEN DO TO THE CON FUSION OF THE PUPIL CARE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT THE PRINCIPLE HAS REFERENCE TO THE NET AND NOT TO THE GROSS PRODUCTSTHAT IS TO SAY IT REFERS TO THE PRODUCTS LEFT OVER AFTER ANY SOIL DEPLETION HAS BEEN RESTORED THE BEST PART OF THIS VOLUME IS FOUND IN ITS DESCRIPTIONS AS DESCRIPTION IS ORDINARILY UNDERSTOOD HOWEVER IN THE HIGHER REALM OF DESCRIPTION WHERE DESCRIPTION RESUMES UNDER THE BRIEFEST FORMULAE THE WIDEST RANGE OF FACTS THE WORK IS NOT STRONG IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO WRITE A SATISFACTORY TEXT FOR BEGINNERS AS FOR OTHERS IN SO DIFFICULT A FIELD AS ECONOMICS IT IS TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT PROFESSOR RAPER HAS THOROUGHLY SUCCEEDED IN DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT HE HAS WRITTEN A TEXT THAT MAY SERVE THE USEFUL FUNCTION OF INTRODUCING THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL LIFE TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE DESTINED NEVER TO GET THE MORE ADVANCED ECONOMIC TRAINING THAT IS SO MUCH NEEDED AS A PREPARATION FOR INTELLIGENT CITIZENSHIP 341 143THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SAKOLSKI A M THE FINANCES OF AMERICAN TRADE UNIONS PP 152 JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY STUDIES IN HISTORY AND

CONSULATE IN 1799 TO THE CLOSE OF THE EXILE AT ST HELENA FROM THIS IT IS APPARENT THAT THIS VOLUME IS NOT INTENDED TO COVER ALL THE CAREER OF NAPOLEON THE EARLY LIFE AND THE PARTICULAR CIR CUMSTANCES

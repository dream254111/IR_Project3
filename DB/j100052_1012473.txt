j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1012473,Report of the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Political and Social Science for the Fiscal Year Ended December 31 1911,i242626,REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 1911 I REVIEW OF THE ACADEMYS ACTIVITIES It is a source of great satisfaction to your Board to be able to place before you at the close of each fiscal year a record of the expanding influence of the Academy With everincreasing faith in the mission which the Academy has to perform your Board has spared no effort to make the Academy one of the important factors in the formation and guidance of the public opinion of the country The year 1911 has witnessed an important step forward in this respect The publications of the Academy as well as its sessions have been arranged with a view to making a definite contribution to the solution of the important political social and industrial problems confronting the country The success of these efforts is attested by the widespread discussion to which both our publications and meetings have given rise Your Board desires again to emphasize a fact to which attention has been repeatedly called in successive annual reports The Academys activities are considerably hampered by the absence of an endowment fund and it is the hope of your Board that at some time in the near future our members will co operate in supplying this fundamental need for the further development of the Academys activities A separate building for the conduct of our publication work and the holding of our sessions should be provided with sufficient addi tional endowment to enable the Academy through a series of fellowships to conduct independent investigations It is the hope of your Board that when the Academy celebrates the twentyfifth anniversary of its founding in 1914 we will be able to accomplish this important purpose II PUBLICATIONS We Have been particularly fortunate in the selection of the subjects for the special volumes issued by the Academy It must be borne in mind that in most cases these subjects are selected a year in advance The Academy is under obligations to the Chairman of the Publication Board Prof Emory R Johnson the Associate Editors Prof E C Stowell Dr Clyde L King Prof Thos Con way Jr Prof S S Huebner and Prof J P Lichtenberger as well as the other members of the Publication Board for the foresight which they have shown in selecting the subjects of these special volumes In most cases these volumes 356Report of the Board of Directors have appeared when the attention of the country was concentrated on the ques tions to which they relate and have exerted no small influence in the formation of a sane and healthy public opinion During the year 1911 the following special volumes appeared January Electric Railway Transportation March Public Health Movement

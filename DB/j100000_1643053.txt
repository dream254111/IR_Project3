National Academy of Sci ences contains the following articles The Cayleyan Curve of the Quartic Teresa Cohen Johns Hopkins University A Search for an Einstein RelativtyGravi tational Effect in the Sun Charles E St John Mount Wilson Solar Observatory Car negieg Institution of Washington A series of observations stretching over several years indicates that the Einstein effect does not ex ist Triads of Transformations of Conjugate Systems of Curves Luther Pfahler Eisen hart department of mathematics Princeton University The Molecular Weights of the Triaryl methyls M Gomberg and C S Schoepfle Chemical Laboratory University of Michigan After discussing factors influencing dissocia tion and the relation between dissociation and the nature of the aryl groups seven triphenyl methyls are investigated in detail and various inferences are drawn from the graphs of their dissociations against their concentrations SexDetermination and SexDifferentiation in Mammals Frank R Lillie department of zoology University of Chicago Discussion of the results of studies of the anatomy of twentytwo fetal freemartins ranging in size from 75 to 28 cm Sex determination in mammals is not irreversible predestination with known methods and principles of physiol ogy we can investigate the possible range of reversibility The Crystal Structure of Magnesium A W Hull Research Laboratory General Elec tric Company Schenectady The structure is analyzed by means of Xray The Structure of HighStanding Atolls W M Davis department of geology Harvard University Attention is drawn to the rela tion of atoll limestones to their supposed foundation of volcanic rocks The relative merits of the glacialcontrol theory and of Darwins theory are discussed Studies of Magnitude in Star Clusters VII A Method for the Determination of the Rela tive Distances of Globular Clusters Harlow Shapley Mount Wilson Solar Observatory Carnegie Institution of Washington The median magnitude of short period variables is constant in each cluster and may be used to determine the distance of the cluster which with one or two exceptions is found to be greater than 30000 lightyears The Principal Axes of Stellar Motion H Raymond Dudley Observatory Albany New SCIENCE 567N S VOL XLVI No 1197 York Three principal axes are determined along which the various groups of stars show markedly unequal motion The eighth number of Volume 3 of the Pro ceedings of the National Academy of Sciences contains the following articles Relation of Preferential Motion and of the SpectralClass and Magnitude Velocity Pro gressions to Proper Motion C D Perrine Observatorio Nacional Argentino Cordoba Growth of Isolated Sporophytes of Antho ceros Douglas Houghton Campbell depart ment of botany Leland Stanford University The young sporophyte of Anthoceros Pear soni separated from its association with the gametophyte is capable of limited growth in length and is able to mature normal spores and elaters from the young sporogenous tissue The Mesa Verde Types of Pueblos J Walter Fewkes Bureau of American Ethnol ogy Washington D C A morphological study of Far View House and other types of prehistoric buildings A Determination of the Ratio of the Spe cific Heats of Hydrogen at 18 and  190 C Margaret C Shields Ryerson Physical Lab oratory University of Chicago The value 14012 closely in accord with kinetic theory and different from previous determinations at 18 C is obtained the value 1592 is found at 190 C Note on the Coefficient of Total Radiation of a Uniformly Heated Enclosure W W Cob lentz Bureau of Standards Washington D C The value 5722 X 1012 is found by direct measurement and agrees with that calculated by Millikan on the basis of his values for h and e The Development of a Source for Standard WaveLengths and the Importance of their Fundamental Values Charles E St John and Harold D Babcock Mount Wilson Solar Observatory Carnegie Institution of Wash ington It is necessary to examine for pole effect the problem of wavelength determina tion is not one of routine but one for real in vestigation On the Presence of Albumoses in Extracts of the Posterior Lobe of the Hypophysis Cerebri John J Abel and M C Pincoffs Pharmacological Laboratory Johns Hopkins University Secondary albumoses and pos sibly peptones were found to be present in all the therapeutically used extracts of the pos terior lobe of the hypophysis cerebri that were examined The Hypophysin of the Farb werkeHoechst is not as claimed for it a solu tion of the isolated active substances of the pituitary gland but a mixture of albumoses with varying and unknown amounts of active and inactive constituents of the gland On the Role of the Thymus in the Produc tion of Tetany Eduard Uhlenhuth Rocke feller Institute of Medical Research New York It would seem that thymus contains the substances which cause tetany and secretes them into the body from which they are re moved by the parathyroids Extirpation of the latter would thus cause tetany Evidence of Assortive Mating in a Nudi branch W J Crozier Bermuda Biological Station for Research Agars Island Bermuda Mating pairs of the nudibranch Chromodoris zebra are found to exhibit a rather high de gree of correlation between the sizes of the two members This is due to assortive mating which may constitute an important influence tending to increase the numbers of larvae Coral

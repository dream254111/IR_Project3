firm of Jagger Son  Turley of Halifax England was recently experimented with at the corporation sewage works of that city The apparatus employed is described as follows A carbon filtering medium is obtained by reducing to a carbonized state dry ashpit refuse which contains a large proportion of animal and vegetable matter The refuse is placed in a carbonizer where it is allowed to remain until the whole mass is charred by a pro cess of slow combustion After the carbonized material is with drawn from the carbonizer it is sifted by means of a circular rid dle and the cinders and a small percentage of clinkers are laid on one side foruse in forming the bottom layers of the filters The finer grades given out by the riddle composed principally of char coal and a small percentagetof ashes are placed as an upper layer of a shallow filter bed about four inches in thickness A small carbonizer has been erected at Halifax and a filter of I02 superficial yards laid down The filter is two and a half feet deep it hais a sixinch concrete bottom and brickwork sides joined in cement The filter is divided by a fourteeninch wall underneath which is laid a channel for conveying away the efRuent The bot tom course of brickwork of the central wall is open jointed to al low the effluent to pass from the layers of cinders to the channel The filter bed is formed as follows At the bottom is placed a six inch layer of rough material which may be clinker or broken bricks or stone Above this layer is placed another composed of oneinch cinders laid three inches thick then follows a layer three inches thick of quarterinch cinders and finally a layer of carbon four inches thick giving a total thickness of sixteen inches The filter isworked with a sixbinch head of sewage The sewage is con ducted to the filter by a sixinch pipe having branches the pipe being laid on the top of the central wall Under each branch is placed a floating splashboard which prevents the sewage washing a hole through the filtering material The sewage flows over and through the carbon The effluent is clear inodorous and color less and has been proved by analysis to be very pure The or ganic matter in suspension mras 4I72 grains per gallon in sewage and II2 grains per gallon in effluent The albumenoid amnnonia in solution was also reduced from o280 grains per gallon in seur age to ooo7 grains per gallon effluent The manner of dealing with the sewage is as follows Across the outfall sewer are placed a series of wirework baskets filled with cinders of different grades to arrest the grosser floating solids The sewage then flows to the filter bed where the purification of the sewage is accomplished No chemicals whatever are used The filterbeds will work at a rate of from 240 to 300 gallons per superficial yard per day according to the density of sewage treated  An acre of filtering surface will be ample for dealing with the sew age from 30ooo persons or say I000000 gallons per day The land required for this process is only one twohundredth part of that required for broad irrigation or onefortieth that required for combined precipitation and filtration The capital cost for this process will be about 340 per thousand inhabitants up to a popu lation of fifty thousand and the annual working expenses for col lectingpand disposing of refuse and purifying sewage inclusive of interest on capital and royalty fees about sixteen cents per head of population This process solves the sludge difEculty No chemicals being used no weight is added to the solids in the sewage the grosser solids are arrested in the cinder baskets and the finer solids are deposited on the top of the filters in the form of a thin skin After a filter has worked for twentyfour hours the flow into that particular filter is stopped the moisture allowed to drain off and the deposit removed by a scum plow a little fresh carbon is laid and the filter is then again ready for work By a simple mechani cal contrivance a filter of one hundred yards can be cleansed anci recharged in ten minutes The average weight of sludge made per million gallons of sewage treated by chemicals is twenty tons In place of a semifluid offensive sludge by this carbonized refuse process there remains a manure uninjured by chemicals which can be carted away as it is rernoved from the filters and which will equal in bulk seven and a half tons per million gallons treated HEALTH MATTERS Leprosy AT a recent meeting of the Epidemiological Society of London a paper was read by Dr P S Abraham on leprosy of which the Laxcet gives the following abstract With the exception of the case recently brought forward in Dublin no British society has lately had the subject under consideration Its importance in British medicine is nevertheless well indicated by the fact that the Royal College of Physicians of London has its  leprosy com mittee which in view of the fact that there is increasing evidence respecting the communicability of leprosy has just recommendecl a full and searching scientific investigation into the whole matter Dr Abraham demonstrated on a map the wide prevalence of the disease especially in the British Empire and remarked that it is no wonder that the subject is coming to the front He hoped that the inquiry urged by the College of Physicians would be sanctioned by the government not only to set at rest if possible doubtfu points regarding the causation of the disease and the desirability of preventive measures but also to allay a possible emotional scare on the part of the British public From the insufficiency of data it is difflcult to say accurately whether leprosy be really increasing or decreasing in many of the British colonies In many cases we have to rely chiefly upon general impressions Even the death re turns cannot be depended upon always for they are frequently as in Jamaica uncertified by qualified practitioners and we must remember the natural anct universal tendency on the part of the sufferers and their friends to conceal their affliction The belief in the increasing spread of leprosy at the Cape of Good Hope was so strong that a leprosy repression act was passed in I884 From the numerous medical reports which Dr Abraham quoted there can be little doubt that the disease is really on the increase in South Africa It probably is spreading but in a less marked manner in the West Indies and on the whole in India especially in certain districts The articles which are now appearing in the AngloIndian press indicate that the public mind is becoming somewhat inflamed over the matter and that there is some cause may be inferred from the large amount of official attention which has been for some time past directed in India to the matter Dr Abraham quoted the late resolution September I888 of the Indian government stating that a measure of rigorous segregation would be repugnant to public opinion and recommending for the present the grant of medicine and charitable relief in voluntary hospitals and asylums A short history of leprosy in Hawaii was then given the latest informatiore having only just come to hand He pointed oMt that in spite of the efforts at isolation the disease had enormously increased since I86S The author gave an account of his visit last ypar to the Norwegian leper asylums and gave particulars relating to the treatment of the patients and the views with which he was favored bv Drs Danielssen Nickoll Kaurin and Daud who were in charge of the asylums at Bergen Molde and Trondhjem He showed curves indicating the relations between the gradual decrease of the disease throughout the country and the number of patients in the hospitals With regard to leprosy in Great Britain and Ireland he referrec to cases he had recently seen in London Through the kindness of Mr Larder he was able to exhibit to the Society two fairly typical examples of the chief varieties of the disease one the  nodular dermal form and the other the socalled  anaesthetic  form The latter case was that of aman sixtyfour years old a meat salesman of English parentage and born in London When young he had been a sailor in the Mediterranean and in the Baltic but had not been out of London for upwards of forty years UntiiAUGUST 23S I 889 SCIENCE I 29 six years ago he had always enjoyed the best possible health The author did not admit that this was a case of de novo development though the period of incubation was extraordinarily long The germ must have been dormant like the mummy wheat for neal ly forty years Atter referring to the present unsatisfactory nomenclature of varieties and to the army and navy records of the disease he in conclusion summed up and had time allowed would have ad duced arguments in support of the theories that leprosy is caused by the bacillus that the disease is communicable from person to person and that segregatior is justifiable Microscopic specimens prepared by the author were exhibited showing the bacZZqgs Zeyircg scraped from the tongue and mouth of a patient and sections of dermal nodules anaesthetic skin nerves etc Many of the refer ences were from hitherto unpublished sources both private and official Death from ElectricitJr A DEATH recently occurred at Brighton England from the ac eidental contact of the conducting wire of the electric lighting ap jparatus with the neck of one of the employees at a brewery The deceased was  found dead  in the neighborhood of the fatal elec trical conductor and a report in a local newspaper states that a postmortem examination revealed perfectly healthy organs the only abnormality in this case being a mark halfway round the neck as if grazed by the wire With the extension of electric lighting says the LanceS occasional fatalities of this kind are to be expected and the number of deaths from this cause has already been considerable In the case recently reported there was it is to be observed a slight mark upon the body and in a case which occurred in I884 a blister was found upon one of the fingers of the deceased with which contact had been accidentally made by the anachine In other cases there has been no mark whatever so that we may conclude that the pathological evidence of the cause of death in such cases is almost nzE It seems to us of the greatest R mportance that these accidents should be carefully studied and it would almost seem to be the duty of the local government board to send a trained pathologist to attend the postmortem examina tion of every case which occurs in order that a careful comparison might be established between the cases and any points which they might present in common be duly noted This could only be done by one having considerable accumulated experience and such ex perience could only come to one having such opportunities as an oSicial position would give The matter is of very great importance because a cause of death which is so to say gradually becoming omnipresent and which leaves no mark is tolerably sure to be made use of for criminal purposes and if there be any certain means of establishing how death took place a knowledge of this would be the only means of checking the misdeeds of persons with criminal intentions It generally has happened hitherto that the surrounding circumstances have left no doubt as to the cause of death but it is not reasonable to suppose that such would always be the case and if it suited the crafty schemes of a criminal it might very easily be contrived otherwise In short there is no doubt that we ought to use every Fendeavor to increase our exact knowledge of this cause of death and we can only hope that postmortem examinations will be care fully made in all cases which occur and that practitioners will re gard it as a duty which they owe to the profession and the public to place upon record the results of such examinations ACANCERA small commune in Normandy Saint Sylvestrede Courcelles with a present population of only 379 as compared with 500 twenty years ago has in the eight years I880 to I887 lost no fewer than eleven of its inhabitants between the ages of sixtytwo and eightythree from cancer a proportion of I5 per cent of the total mortality All but one of the cases were males and in as many as eight the cancer was seated in the stomach Such facts have led Dr Arnaudet according to LUnson MeNcaiNe to con clude that carlcer isttcontagious and is propagated through the medium of water It is true he remarks that not one of the eleven persons mentioned were water drinkers but then they drank cider which is made with the pond water of the district Dr Ar naudet thinks this sufficient ground to advocate the use of antisep tics and of boiled water as prophylactics against cancer as well as against typhoid fever or phthisis TYPHUS BACILLI IN WATERSeveral cases of typhoid have recently occurred in a town in the province of Baden Germany and it came to light that three of the patients first affected procured their drinking water from the same well The water was then examined the strictest precautions being used to prevent infection from other sources In three days the cultures were found to have developed on an average one hundred and fortv thousand colonies to the cubic centimetre Ten tests had been made but only in one of these was there found a single colony of typhoid bacilli NOTES AND NEWS IT is officiallv announced that a general national exhibition of agriculture and sylviculture will be held at AJienna next year from the Isth of May to the I5th of October The exhibition is to in clude the following international sections I machinery and im plements used in agriculture sylviculture and the industries cog nate to them such as horticulture viticulture hopgrowing bees silk fishing and hunting 2 artificial and auxiliary branches of agriculture such as artificial manures remedies for sick animals etc 3 models plans designs and statistical information respect ing agriculture and forestry 4 inventions dealing with the utili zation of waste material 5 information anci suggestions respect ing the food supply of large cities The fiftyninth annual meeting of the British Association will be held at NewcastleonTyne beginning on Sept II and I2 and the Durham Northumberland and Newcastle Botanical and Hor ticultural Society has arranged to hold its autumn meeting and exhibition at the same time and place The local committee hare spared no efforts to make the arrangements for the meeting as complete as possible and their labors have been greatly lightdned by the fact that many fine buildings suitable for the purposes of the association have been erected since it held its last meeting at that place in I863 The receptionrooms occupying a central po sition with respect to the various section looms will be located in the new buildings of the University of Durham College of Medi cine in which building a writingroom and ladies drawingroom will be provided and special rooms for the use of the officers of the association The Cambridge Drill Hall near the receptionroom is to be fitted up for a luncheonroom Sections A and B will meet in the new buildings of the College of Science opened in November last and in the chemical laboratory of this college it is intended to bring together a series of exhibits illustrating the chemical and allied manufactures of the district The general meetings of the Association will be held in St Georgeis Drill Hall The Natural History Museum opened in I884 in which building is Mr Hancocks unique collection of British birds will be used for the two sozrees the first to be given by the mayor and corporation and the second by the local committee A guidebook arranged in three sections has been prepared for the occasion dealing re spectively with tlle history and topography the geology and natural history and the industries of the district The

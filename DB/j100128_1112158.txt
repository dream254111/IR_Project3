1917 167 N Y Supp 981 Whether a general servant of an independent contractor becomes a servant of the contractee pro hac vice so as to make the contractee liable for the negligence of the servant is a question of fact and depends on the construction given to the contract See Linnehan v Rollins 1884 137 Mass 123 Standard Oil Co v Anderson 1908 212 U S 215 29 Sup Ct 252 The real problem is whether the contract of service is transferred or only the use and benefit of the servants work Cf Moore v Palmer 1886 2 T L R 781 In the cases of hired horsedrawn and motor vehicles authorities are hopelessly conflicting on the question as to what degree of control must be exercised by the contractee over the driver to effect a change of service but the pre sumption seems to be that the owner remains the master of the driver 1 Labatt Master and Servant 2nd ed  54 However if the servant is wholly under the control of the contractee he becomes the servant of the contractee Cain v Hugh Nawn Contracting Co 1909 202 Mass 237 88 N E 842 Philadelphia etc Co v Barrie C C A 1910 179 Fed 50 Apparently on the facts of the case at hand the chauffeur was the servant of the contractee But see Shepard v Jacobs 1910 204 Mass 110 90 N E 392 Having once decided that the chauffeur was not a servant of the contractor it would seem that the contractor cannot be held liable merely because he owned the machine An auto mobile is not an agency so dangerous as to render the owner liable irrespective of the relation of master and servant between owner and driver Lewis v Amorous 1907 3 Ga App 50 59 S E 338 Jones v Hoge 1907 47 Wash 663 92 Pac 433 since the dangers incident to its use are the result of the conduct of those in charge of it and do not inhere in the construction and use of the vehicle See Steffen v McNaughton 1910 142 Wis 49 124 N W 1016 But notwithstand ing this the owner is liable for injuries to a third person if he rented the machine to another knowing that it was uncontrollable as the machine thereby became a dangerous instrumentality See Texas Co v Veloz Tex Civ App 1913 162 S W 377 MONOPOLIESSHERMAN LAWTHE RULE OF REASONSELLING LOSING BUSINESSA corporation unable to continue its business without loss because of active but legitimate competition on the part of its only competitor prays for modification of a previous injunction so as to be permitted to sell out its plant as a going concern to such competitor rather than to dispose of it as junk Held the prayer is granted but an injunction previously in force against the prospective buyer is modified so as to require the buyer to continue to deal fairly with the public American Press Association et al v United States et al 7 C C A 1917 245 Fed 91 The above decision amounts to a holding that the courts shall apply the rule of reason to a statute which on its face purports to brand as illegal Every contract combination    or conspiracy in restraint of trade or as a criminal Every person who shall monop olize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire    to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States Sherman AntiTrust Law 26 Stat 209 c 647 Here an act of combination which will result in a complete monopoly is permitted because in the opinion of the court it will not unduly restrain trade whereas in Standard Oil Co v United States 1910 221 U S 1 60 279COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW 31 Sup Ct 502 and United States v American Tobacco Co 1910 221 U S 106 179 31 Sup Ct 632 where the rule of reason was first enunciated it was entirely unnecessary for the decision of the cases to say that only undue or unreasonable restraint of trade was covered by the statute for under any theory the combinations were illegal Such dicta may have served a purpose in clearing away appre hension that the courts would interpret the statute literally as indi cated by unfortunate dicta in some of the earlier cases see United States v TransMissouri Freight Assn 1897 166 U S 290 312 17 Sup Ct 540 but all the cases previous to the 1910 decisions in the actual results reached show that not every contract or com bination in restraint of trade was illegal but that there must have been an element of illegality about such contract or combination as measured by some standard not to be found in the act itself See Cincinnati etc Packet Co v Bay 1906 200 U S 179 26 Sup Ct 208 also 23 Harvard Law Rev 353 for a review of the cases up to 1909 This means that the cases were all decided under the rule of reason the courts reaching their conclusions as to what was reasonable restraint of trade by the same process as that employed by the common law courts to reach their conclusions when questions of restraint of trade within their jurisdiction are presented The purpose of the Sherman AntiTrust Law as shown by the debates in Congress at the time was to enable the federal government to handle restraint oftrade casees because there was no federal common law See Standard Oil Co v United States supra 50 In the principal case prima facie there is a contract in restraint of trade because a competitor is elimi nated But on two theories the decision can be supported that such restraint is not unreasonable first that the competitor will in any event cease doing business so that buying him out is a merely nominal restraint second that any undue restraint which might be caused by the resulting monopoly is to be avoided by the supervision of the court under the injunction Whether the machinery of the equity court is adequate for proper supervision over prices if not over methods of maintaining such monopoly without relying on aid from the Federal Trade Commission as recently done in United States v Mead not yet reported 18 Columbia Law Rev 137 is another question MORTGAGESMERGEREFFECT OF PURCHASE OF EQUITY OF REDEMPTION BY A MORTGAGEE WHO ASSIGNED SECURED NOTESThe plaintiff in a foreclosure action was an assignee of notes secured by realty held by the defendant who had acquired successively the mortgage and the equity of redemption Further relief in the nature of an order for a temporary injunction restraining waste was asked The court rejected the defence of merger of legal and equitable interests and though refusing to grant an injunction gave the plaintiff proper relief Stewart v Munger  Bennet N C 1917 93 S E 927 When the equity of redemption and the legal estate of the mortgagee meet under the common ownership of the mortgagee the ordinary result is a merger of the lesser interest into the greater Jones Mortgages 7th ed  870 cf Pearson v Bailey 1902 180 Mass 229 62 N E 265 But the courts view this operation of mergei vigilantly and have interfered so frequently to prevent it that the rule of merger has been declared to be determined by the intention of the party in whom the interests are united See First Natl Bank v Essex 1882 84 Ind 144 This intention is discovered by the circumstances of the particular 280

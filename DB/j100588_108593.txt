J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108593,ON THE REPRESENTATION OF POLYEDRA,I207011, 413  XVIII ON THE REPRESENTATION OF POLYEDRA BY THE REV THOMAS P KLRKMAN MA COMMUNICATED BY A CAYLEY FRS RECEIVED AUGUST 6READ DECEMBER 6 855 TO EVERY PEDRAL QACRON OR SOLID HAVING P FACES AND Q SUMMITS CORRESPONDS A QEDRAL PACRON WHOSE Q FACES HAVE THE SAME ORDER OF SUCCESSION AND RANK AS TO NUMBER OF EDGES WITH THE Q SUMMITS AND WHOSE P SUMMITS CORRESPOND IN THE SAME WAY TO THE P FACES OF THE QACRON WHEN PQ THE CORRESPONDING PAIR WILL SOMETIMES BE IDENTICAL FIGURES AS TO THE NUMBER RANK AND ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR FACES AND SUMMITS WHILST AT OTHER TIMES AS WILL ALWAYS BE THE CASE IF P IS NOT Q THE TWO FIGURES WILL DIFFER WHEN THEY DIFFER THEY MAY BE CALLED A SYMPOLAR PAIR OF HETEROPOLARS OR SIMPLY A SYMPOLAR PAIR WHEN THEY ARE THE SAME FIGURE IT MAY BE CALLED AN AUTOPOLAR POLYEDRON AN ELEGANT METHOD OF REPRESENTING AN IMTNENSE NUMBER OF SYMPOLAR PAIRS AND AUTOPOLARS MAY BE DEDUCED FROM THE PROPERTY ENUNCIATED IN THE THEOREMTS FOLLOWING A AND B DEFANY MOSTANGLED FACE OF A POLYEDRON BEING TAKEN AS ITS BASE THE ANGLES OF THE BASE MAY BE CALLED BASESUMMITS THE REMAINING ANGLES OF THE FACES EITHER COLLA TERAL OR SYNACRAL WITH THE BASE MAY BE TERMED WALLSUMMITS AND ALL SUMMITS LYING ONLY IN FACES NEITHER COLLATERAL NOR SYNACRAL WITH THE BASE WE MAY NAME CROWN SUMMITS IF A POLYEDRON HAS BASESUMMITS AA2A3 WALLSUMMITS BB2B AND CROWN SUMMITS BESIDES THE LATTER MAY CONSIST OF A SYSTEM C1C2C LYING IN FACES THAT CON TAIN ALSO SOME OF BB2B AND AN INTERIOR SYSTEM DD2D NOT LYING IN FACES CONTAINING ANY OF BB2B3 THE SUMMITS DD2D MAY BE LOOKED AT AS WALLWSUMMITS REFERRED TO C1C2C3 AS BASESUMMITS AND AS CROWNSUMMITS REFERRED TO BLB2B3 AS BASESUMMITS AND THERE MAY BE ANY NUMBER OF SYSTEMS OF CROWNSUMMITS INTERIOR TO DD2D AS E3E2E LEADING UP TOFF2FF C A IF IN ANY QACRON THERE ARE EITHER NO CROWNSUMMITS OR IF FTROM EACH OF THE WALL SUMMITS BBB  THERE PASSES AN EDGE TO ONE OF THE CROWNSUMMITS CLC2C AND FIOM EACH OF C1C2C AN EDGE TO ONE OF D 3D2D AND FROM EACH OF DLDD AN EDGE TO ONE OF EEE AND SO ON THE Q SUMLNITS OF THE QACRON ARE THE ANGLES OF A CLOSED QGON WHOSE Q SIDES ARE ALL EDGES OF THE QACRON B IF IN ANY PEDRON THERE ARE EITHER NO FACES Y7L7S OF WHICH NONE HAS ANY SUMMIT COLLATERAL OR SYNACRAL WITH THE MOSTANGLED SUMMIT S OF THE PEDRON OR IF EACH OF THE FACES P13 ABOUT S IS COLLATERAL WITH SOME ONE OF Y17273 A CLOSED MDCCCLVI 3 IREV T P KIRKMAN ON THE REPRESENTATION OF POLYEDRA POLYGON OF P SIDES CAN BE DRAWN ON THE FACES OF THE FIGTRE SO AS TO HAVE A SIDE ON EVERY FACE AND TO PASS THROUGH NO SUMMIT THERE IS NO USE IN PERPLEXING FURTHER THE ENUNCIATION OF B AS ITS TRUTH FOLLOWS FROM AND ITS EXTENT IS PARALLEL WITH THAT OF A NOR IS IT WORTH WHILE TO TROUBLE THE READER WITH DEMONSTRATIONS OF THESE PROPERLTIES SINCE THEY ARE NOT PROPERTIES OF ALL POLYEDRA A NEGATIVE WHICH MAY HOWEVER BE WORTH THE PROVING IT MAY SUFFICE AND MAY PER HAPS BE USEFUL TO SHOW THE CONNEXION BETWEEN THESE CLOSED POLYGONS AND A PLEASING MODE OF REPRESENTATION LET US SUPPOSE THAT IN ANY PEDRAL QACRON WE HAVE TRACED THE CLOSED PGON THROUGH THE FACES AND THE CLOSED QGON THROUGH THE SUMMITS AND LET THE EDGES OF THE PGON BE NUMBERED IN ORDER 1 2P AND THE ANGLES OF THE QGON 1 2Q THUS ARE ALL THE FACES AND SUMMITS OF THE PEDRAL QACRON NUMBERED IN THE CIRCLES 1 2 3PL2 AND 1 2 3Q12 ANY EDGE OF THE FIGURE MAY BE READ ABED A AND C BEING ITS LEFT AND RIGHT SUMMITS AND B AND D ITS UPPER AND LOWER FACES OR CDAB WHICH IS THE SAME THING TURNING THE FIGURE ABOUT IN THE SAME FACE D WE READ PASSING TOWARDS THE RIGHT FROM C TO THE SUMMIT E THE EDGE CFED OR EDCF IN THE TWO FACES D ANDF THUS IT APPEARS THAT IN THE READING OF THE EDGES ANY CONSECUTIVE AND EXTERNAL DUAD AS CDL IN ABCD WILL OCCUR REVERSED AND INTERNAL AS DC IN EDCF AND VICE VERSD WE CAN THUS REPRESENT THE PQ2 EDGES OF THE PEDRAL QACRON BY AS MANY QUADRUPLETS SO FORMED THAT EVERY CONTIGUOUS INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL DUAD SHALL OCCUR AGAIN REVERSED AS AN EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL DUAD THE QUADRUPLETS BEING ALL READ FROM LEFT TO RIGHT LET XYXY X2YXY BE TWO OF THESE QUADRUPLETS THE FORMER IS AN EDGE AT THE XTH SUMMIT AND IN THE YTH FACE AND ALSO AT THE XTH SUMMIT AND IN THE YTH FACE THE LIKE IS CONCEIVED OF THE LATTER AT THE POINTS XY AND XY REFERRED TO RIGHT AXES WRITE A AT XY1 AND XIY2 WRITE B AND SO ON WITH ALL THE PQ2 EDGES ABED THE RESULT IS A PARADIGM OF THE FIGURE AND ITS SYMPOLAR THE HORIZONTAL MULTIPLETS WILL BE THE FACES DENOTED BY THEIR EDGES THE VERTICAL ONES THE SUMMITS SO DENOTED OR VICE VERSD THE EDGES IN SUMMIT OR FACE WILL STAND IN THEIR TRUE ORDER FOR THE CLOSED QGON THROUGH THE SUMMITS IF IT LEAVES ANY FACE BEFORE IT HAS COMPLETED THE CIRCUIT THEREOF MUST RETURN TO IT TO COMPLETE THAT IN THE SAME DIRECTION OTHERWISE IT WOULD CROSS ITS OWN PATH AND PASS MORE THAN ONCE THROUGH ONE OR MORE SUMMITS WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE AS IT HAS ONLY Q SIDES EVERY PYRAMID IS AUTOPOLAR IF THE BASE BE 2NLGONAL THE SYSTEM OF EDGES IS DENOTED BY 4N2 QUADRUPLETS IN PAIRS OF THE FORM ABED DCBA OR AS WELL BY AS MANY IN PAIRS OF THE FORM ABED DABC EITHER EDGE IN ANY PAIL LIES BETWEEN THE POLES OF THE FACES THROUGH THE OTHER I CALL THESE TWO EDGES AA A GAMIC PAIR AND EITHER IS THE GAMIC OF THE OTHER THUS THE PENTAGONAL PYRAMID IS REPRESENTED BY

HORIZONTAL LINE IS CONTIGUOUS ALSO IN A VERTICAL LINE IF WE OBSERVE THAT THE EXTREMES OF ANY MULTIPLET ARE A CONTIGUOUS DUAD THIS SHOWS THAT ANY ANGLE AD IN A FACE IS ALSO AIT ANGLE IN A SUMMIT A PROPERTY WHICH THE PARADIGM OF COURSE ALWAYS HAS WHETHER OF AUTOPOLAR OR HETEROPOLAR FIGURE IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT IN THE FIRST ARRANGEMENT NO EDGE A MEETS ITS GAMNIC A IN A POINT WHILST IN THE SECOND

K N HERE ARE TWO DISTINCT HETEROPOLARS ONE HAS TWO QUADRILATERALS DEML AND KJEF HAVING A COMMON SIDE E THE OTHER HAS TWO QUADRILATERALS CJKL AND GLMN THAT HAVE NO COMMON SIDE THE READER WILL FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN DRAWING THESE OCTAEDRA BY JOINING THE ANGLES OF A PENTAGON TO THREE INCLUDED WALLSUMMITS IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT IN ALL THESE SETS OF QUADRUPLETS REPRESENTING ANY PEDRAL QACRON IF WE COLLECT THOSE WHICH CONTAIN ANY GIVEN NUMERAL IN THE SAME PLACE WE SHALL FIND THAT IN THE TWO ADJOINING PLACES THEY EXHIBIT CIRCLES OF THE SAME NUMBERS DIFFERING BY ONE CYCLICAL STEP THUS COLLECTING FROM THE ABOVE THE QUADRUPLETS CON TAINING 8 IN THE FOURTH PLACE 8118 1228 2338 3678 7788 SHOW THE CIRCLE 81237 IN THE FIRST AND THIRD PLACES AND THOSE CONTAINING I IN THE SECOND PLACE 8118 1142 4185 SHOW THE CIRCLE 814 IN THE FIRST AND THIRD FROM THIS PROPERTY OF THE CLOSED PGON AND QGON OF PROPS A AND B IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME LIGHT MAY BE THROWN WHEN THE MATTER IS BETTER HANDLED ON THE CLASSIFI CATION OF POLYEDRA SUCH AS MAY LEAD TO THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THEIR ENUME RATION IT IS EASY TO PROVE THAT THERE ARE POLYEDRA ON WHICH THE CLOSED POLYGONS CANNOT BE DRAWN FOR SUPPOSE THE QGON OF PROP A DRAWN ON A QACRON IN MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF ANY FACE G WHICH WE ENTER ACROSS AN EDGE FG WHICH IS NOT AN EDGE OF THE QGON WE ADD TO THE NUMBER OF SUMMITS COUNTED IN F AND OTHER FACES ALL THE SUMMITS OF G EXCEPT TWO THESE TWO HAVING BEEN ENUMERATED IN THE CIRCUIT OF F FROM WHICH WE ENTER G THAT IS COUNTING FIRST ALL THE SUMMITS OF THE BASE WE ADD TO THESE FOR EVERY MGON WHOSE CIRCUIT WE PROCEED TO MAKE M2 SUMMITS MORE THE NUM BER OF FACES CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE BASE BY EDGES NOT PART OF THE CLOSED QGON WHOSE CIRCUITS THE CLOSED QGON MAKES AND INCLUDES WILL BE OA3G4C 5A3K WHERE C IS THE NUMBER OF MGONS AMONG THEM AND AC THAT 417REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE REPRESENTATION OF POLYEDRA OF THE KGONS THE BASE BEING ONE OF THESE THE WHOLE NUMBER OF SUMMITS WILL THEREFORE BE S324243S  K 2K2Q FOR WE HAVE COUNTED ALL THE SUMMITS OF ONE KGON VIZ OF THE BASE IN ORDER THEN THAT SUCH A QGON SHOULD BE POSSIBLE IT IS NECESSARY THAT AMONG THE P FACES OF OUR PEDRAL QACRON THERE SHOULD BE A TRIANGLES 0C QUADRILATERALS Z5 PENTAGONS C OF WHICH THE ABOVE EQUATION CAN BE AFFIRMED NOW IF Q SHOULD BE ODD AND ALL THE P FACES EVENANGLED THIS EQUATION BECOMES 2A 4A6 6A8C 2R 1 WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE HENCE IT APPEARS THAT IF THE NUMBER OF SUMMITS OF A QACRON BE ODD WHILE THE FACES ARE ALL EVENANGLED THE CLOSED QGON CANNOT BE DRAWN THROUGH ITS SUMMITS I FIND EXCEEDINGLY FEW POLYEDRA ON WHICH THE CLOSED PGON AND QGON CANNOT BE DRAWN IN FACT IT IS FAR FROM BEING NECESSARY TO THEIR EXISTENCE THAT ALL THE CONDITIONS OF THE THEOREMS A AND B SHOULD BE FILFILLED IF WE CUT IN TWO THE CELL OF THE BEE BY A SECTION OF ITS SIX PARALLEL EDGES WE HAVE A 13ACRON WHOSE FACES ARE ONE HEXAGON AND NINE QUADRILATERALS THE CLOSED 13GON CANNOT BE DRAWN BUT IF A LINE BE DRAWN FROM THE TRIEDRAL VERTEX TO THE OPPOSITE ANGLE OF ONE OF THE QUADRILATERALS ABOUT THAT VERTEX AND THIS QUADRTILATERAL SLLPPOSED BROKEN INTO TWO TRIANGLES HAVING THAT LINE FOR THEIR COMMON EDGE WE SHALL THEN HAVE A 13ACRON WHOSE FACES ARE ONE HEXAGON EIGHT QUADRILATERALS AND TWO TRIANGLES AND WHOSE SUMMITS ARE NINE TRIACES AND TWO TESSARACES OF THIS FIGURE THE PARADIGM CAN BE CONSTRUCTED HERE I WOULD FAIN BEG THE READERS PERMISSION TO CALL A 5EDRAL SUMMIT A PENTACE A 6 OR 7EDRAL SUMMIT A HEXACE OR A HEPTACE THE WORDS ARE AT LEAST CONVENIENT IN SPEAKING OF THE SUMMITS OF POLYACRA AS AUTHORITIES AND ANALOGY ARE ALIKE DIVIDED ABOUT THE SPELLING OF THE WORD POLY EDRON I LIAVE PLEASED MYSELF HEREIN WHY POLYHEDRON OF NECESSITY AND YET NOT PERI HODIC 418

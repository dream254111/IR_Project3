APPEALS OF VIRGINIA WYTHEVILLE FULKERSON AND OTHERS V TAYLOR AND OTHERS June 19 1902 1 CHANCERY PRACTICEEnforcement of judymentsAlieneesBurden of proof The burden is upon the judgment creditor seeking to sabject land in the hands of his debtors alienee for value to show that the land is liable If the bill alleges a sale and no conveyance but does not allege an unrecorded written contract and the answer denies a written contract and avers a verbal contract and such performance thereunder prior to May 1 1888 as would have entitled the purchaser to specific performance as against his vendor there can be no recovery unless the averments of the answer are overcome 2 SUBROGATIONPayment of liens Volunteers A purchaser of real estate who is compelled to pay a vendors lien tnereon for his own protection is not a volunteer but will be subrogated to the rights of such vendor and if necessary the lien will be kept alive for his protection 3 PERSONAL JUDGMENTsDescriptive words The word curator annexed to the name of a defendant against whom a decree is rendered io descriptive merely and the decree is a personal decree although there be superadded a direction to the defendant  as curator  to collect and apply certain funds to its payment 4 LTIMITATION OF ACTIONS  Judgments  Voible execuion An execution issued on an unconditional decree for money in contravention of the agree ment of the parties entered of record is voidable only and is sufficient to stop the running of the act of limitations on the decree 5 JuDGmTsDocketingIndexingAllegation and proof of indexing An alle gation in a bill that a judgment sought to be enforced was duly docketed is a sufficient allegation of the indexing of the judgment as required by sec 3561 of the Code but if the fact of indexing be put in issue it must be proved and it would seem that this is not sufficiently done by the mere production of an abstract of the judgment which does not certify that it was duly docketed and makes no reference to the indexing Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Lee County pro nounced June 8 1901 in a suit in chancery wherein the appellee Eliza A Taylor was the complainant and appellants and others were the defendants Reversed The opinion states the case C T Duncan and B H Sewell for the appellants R T Irvine and L T Hyatt for the appellees KEITH P delivered the opinion of the court Eliza A Taylor filed her bill in the Circuit Court of Lee County  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter256 8 VIRGINA LAW REGISTER Aug from which it appears that in March 1893 she recovered a judg ment in that court against L D Fulkerson for the sum of 432 with interest which was duly docketed in the clerks office of said county on the 27th of March 1893 She further shows that by deed dated April 3 1888 James W Orr commissioner in a chan cery cause conveyed to L D Fulkerson a lot of land containing three acres which deed was admitted to record on the 14th day of October 1894 that Fulkerson afterwards sold said parcel of lancd to I R Thomas and put him in possession thereof but made no conveyance of it to him and afterwards the heirs of Thomas sold and conveyed this lot to C Mf Morgan who sold to James M Wheeler who having died this lot was upon partition of his real estate assigned to his daughter Mollie Kesterson at whose re quest Fulkerson and wife and Mforgan and wife by deed dated August 31 1894 conveyed it to C R Kesterson her husband This deed was duly recorded on the 9th of October 1894 This lot is known in the record as the 3 acre mill tract It further appears that James W Orr commissioner on the 11th of May 1892 conveyed to L D Fulkerson by deed of that date four parcels of land which Fulkerson had purchased some years before in the chancery cause of Richmonds Admr v Bales and Others Filkerson between the date of his purchase and the 24th of September 1889 sold lots 1 2 and 3 and one half interest in lot No 4 to John C Vanoy who went into possession thereof and to him Fulkerson executed a title bond which was never recorded Vanoy and wife on the 24th of September 1889 conveyed a strip of this land as a right of way to the Louisville  Nashville Rail road Company This deed is recorded in Lee county clerks office Afterwards Fulkerson and wife and Vanoy and wife by deed dated June 24 1892 conveyed these three lots and the one half interest in the 4th lot to Moses L and James Ml Ely This deed was duly recorded on the 17th of December 1894 The other one half interest in the 4th lot was sold by Fulkerson and wife to their son C E Fulkerson on the 20th of June 1892 and this deed was recorded on the 11th of March 1895 This one half lot was con veved by C E Fulkerson to Granville Smith and by Smith to William A Crockett who now owns it It appears that L D Fulkerson was at one time the owner of two other tracts of land situated in Lee county one of which was conveyed to him by David Chadweil by deed of April 21 18931902 FULKERSON V TAYLOR 257 duly recorded in Lee county containing 113 acres and by the same deed an undivided interest in about 80 acres which was afterwards conveyed to him by J M Wheeler by deed of January 30 1875 The other of the two tracts referred to contains 51 acres and was conveyed to Fulkerson by H S Hoskins by deed of February 6 1878 The tracts containing 113 and 51 acres were conveyed by Fulkerson to J M Wheeler by deed dated October 4th and re corded November 10th 1887 August 21 1889 Wheeler conveyed a strip of this land to the Louisville  Nashville Railroad Com pany as a right of way By deed dated February 5 1890 Fulker son and wife sold and conveyed to James M1 Wheeler the 80 acre tract above mentioned Wheeler Sr died without ever haning parted with any of said land except that parcel which he had con veyed to the L  N R R Co for a right of way After his death his real estate was partitioned among his heirs and these lands were assigned to his son James M Wheeler Jr The bill sets out a number of judgments prays that Fulkerson and his several alienees may be made parties defendant that all proper accounts may be taken and the assets marshalled so that each creditor may receive that to which he is entitled All of the judgment creditors alluded to came in and were made parties to the suit Certainl of the defendants filed answers to which the plaintiffs presented numerous exceptions and the cause coming on to be heard upon the bill answers exceptions crossbills exhibits de positions and reports the court decreed that none of the judg ments sought to be enforced were liens upon the 3 acre mill tract owned by the defendant Mollie Kesterson being of opinion that the proof showed a verbal contract of purchase by Thomas from Fulkerson prior to May 1 1888 followed by payment of all the purchase money and by such improvements thereon and possession thereof as entitled Joseph R Thomas and those claiming under him to holdthe land free from the claims of Fulkersons creditors The court was of opinion and so decreed that the judgment of Charles E Baylor rendered Sept 3 1887 for 197991 and cer tain other judgments set out in the decree of subsequent date were liens upon the land conveyed by Fulkerson and wife and Vanoy and wife to Moses L and James M Ely upon the strip conveyed by Vanoy and wife to the L  N R R Co and upon the parcel of land conveyed by Fulkerson and wife to C E Fulkerson and258 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug that the Baylor judgment was a lien on the 80 acres of land con veyed by Fulkerson and wife to James M Wheeler Sr and on the two tracts of 113 acres and l acres conveyed by Fulkerson and wife to Wheeler by deed of Oct 4 1887 and also on the strip con veved by Wheeler to the L  N R R Co by deed of Aug 21 1889 and it appearing that these lands would not rent for enough within five years to pay off and discharge the judgments they were decreed to be sold From this decree the L  N R R Co and certain other parties aggriex ed applied for and obtained an appeal The first question which we will consider is upon the error as signed by the appellees to so much of the decree as exempts the 3 acre mill tract from their demands We are of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court is right upon this point It was for the plaintiffs to state and prove a case which entitled them to recover Fulkerson purchased the mill tract from Orr commissioner on the 3d of April VMS8 It seems that as early as July 7 1879 Orr commissioner in the case of Chadwell v Chadwell et als pending in the Circuit Court of Lee County sold this parcel of land to Fulkerson and the sale was duly confirmed at the November term About September 1883 Ful kerson sold this tract of land to Thomas and put him in possession and Thomas and those claiming under him paid the whole pur chase price and made extensive improvements upon the land and it is not denied that as between themselves and Fulkerson they were entitled to the specific execution of the contract of sale and to a deed investing them with the title If the creditors of Fulkerson can under such circumstances subject this property it must be by force of the statute law with respect to the recordation of cer tain instruments The bill filed in this case does not allege that there was any written evidence of the contract of sale from Ful kerson to Joseph R Thomas It alleges that Fulkerson sold the tract of land to Thomas put him in possession thereof but never made any conveyance to him but it does not state that there was a written contract The answer of the defendants denies that there was a written contract and asserts that it was a verbal one under which possession was delivered and the whole purchase price paid The burden was upon the plaintiffs to make out their case and the evidence upon which they relied is insufficient for that purpose The Circuit Court held that this parcel of land was ex1902 FULKERSON V TAYLOR 259 onerated from the charge which plaintiffs sought to impose upon it and that decree we cannot disturb upon the record before us The next question arising upon the appeal is as to the liability of the parcels of land purchased by Fulkerson in the chancery cause of Richmond v Bales sold by him to Vanoy and known in the record as The Ely lands It appears that Fulkerson owed a considerable part of the pur chase money for these lands which was paid to the commissioner charged with the duty bf collecting it by John C Vanoy that the money thus paid constituted a lien upon the land superior to any claim of Fulkerson or his creditors is not disputed but the con tention is that Vanoy in making the payment was a mere volunteer who will not be protected by a court of ecluity The question was presented in the Circuit Court by an exception taken by the plaintiff to the answer of the defendant The ex ception is in the following words With reference to the payments made by Vanoy on Fulkersons purchase from the commissioner in the cause of Richmond Admr v Bales Even if Vanoy made these payments as alleged there must be the further allegation made that Yanoy was forced to make such payments in addition to the purchase money he had agreed to pay to Fulkerson before he would be entitled to subro gation Further the right of subrogation is a personal right and the railroad company cannot set it up for Vanoy This must be done by Vanoy or his assignees This exception was sustained by the Circuit Court and in this we think there was error Vanoy found his land bound by a lien for purchase money due by his grantor and paid it off He did what was necessary to protect his own interest and will not be considered in a court of equity as a volunteer As was said by Judge Staples in Gatewood v Gatewood 75 Va 411 But if the party making the payment does not occupy the position of surety for the debt as a general rule he cannot claim to be entitled as assignee unless by agreement with the creditor Subrogation is however a very different thing from an assign ment It is the act of the law and the creature of a court of equity depending not upon contract but upon the principles of equity and justice It presupposes an actual payment and satis faction of the debt secured by the mortgage260 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug But although the debt is paid and satisfied a court of equity will keep alive the lien for the benefit of the party who made the payment provided he as security for the debt has such an interest in the land as entitles him to the benefit of the security given for its payment It may be laid down as a rule of almost universal acceptance that where there is a mortgage upon real estate any person who has the right to redeem such mortgage and actually does redeem it is entitled for his indemnity to be subrogated to the lien of the mortgage and to hold the land until he is reimbursed to the amount so paid In such case no proof of interest on his part is necessary to keep the mortgage alive and to give him the benefit of it The payment of the mortgage together with his relation to the estate is brought in aid of his title to strengthen and uphold it Who then is entitled to redeem It is well settled that a judgment creditor a junior mortgagee a purchaser of the equity redemption a tenant in dower a tenant by curtesy and indeed all persons having an interest in the estate may insist upon the re demption of the mortgage in order to the due enforcement of their claims And on page 414 he says So far has this doctrine been carried that the courts in behalf of purchasers and others entitled to re demption have reestablished mortgages which have been dis charged of record in ignorance of the existence of judgment liens acquired subsequent to the mortgage In many cases the courts will keep the encumbrance alive or consider it extinguished as will best secure the purposes of justice and the just intentions of the parties Indeed the mortgage will be kept on foot if neces sary for the purposes of justice although the interests of the mortgagee and the equity of redemption unite in the same person It has been verv properly said the doctrine of subrogation at first applied in behalf of those who were bound by the original security with the debtor has been greatly enlarged and the principles modi fied to meet the circumstances of cases that have arisen betwoen different classes of sureties and creditors so as to do substantial justice and equity in each case Pomeroys Equity sec 791 says that where the legal ownership of the land and the absolute ownership of the encumbrance be come vested in the same person the intention governs the merger1902 PULKESON V TAYLOR 261 in equity If this intention has been expressed it controls in the absence of such an expression the intention will be presumed from what appear to be the best interests of the party as shown by all the circumstances If his interests require the encumbrance to be kept alive his intention to do so will be inferred and followed If on the contrary his best interests are not opposed to a merger then a merger will take place according to his supposed intention Rorer v Ferguson 96 Va 411 Sands v Durham 99 Va 263 Having reached this concltision it is unnecessary to consider other questions presented with respect to these parcels of land We come now to consider whether the Baylor judgment is a lien upon the lands conveyed by Fulkerson and wife to J M Wheeler by deed of Oct 4 1887 recorded on the 10th of Nov of that year and on another tract of land conveyed by Fulkerson and wife to Wheeler by deed dated Feb 5 1890 recorded on April 1st of that year These tracts were on Sept 3 1887 the property of Fulkerson and on that day in the Circuit Court of Lee County in the suit of Edmonson v Ferguson and Others a decree was rendered in favor of Chas E Baylor against L D Fulkerson curator for the sum of 197991 with interest thereon from August 25 1886 till paid and by consent of parties by their counsel no execution was to issue upon that decree for nine months from that time and said Ful kerson as such curator is ordered to proceed at once to collect any money due him as such and to apply the same in discharge of the recoveries against him This is plainly a personal decree against Fulkerson the words curator etc which are superadded are merely descriptive and the direction to him to proceed to collect any money due him as curator and apply it in discharge of this recovery does not alter its natuire or affect it in any way It was for his failure to collect money due him in his capacity as curator that the decree was rendered against him and he having been made personally liable for the debt would of course have the right to collect and apply the money so collected to his own relief Another defence to this decree is that it was barred by the statute of limitations no execution having been issued upon it within ten years It appears from the record that on the 9th of September 1887 six days after the decree against Fulkerson was rendered the clerk262 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug of the Circuit Court of Lee County issued an execution upon it formal and accurate in all respects upon which there is the follow ing return Not executed on account of sickness S HI Ewing S L C The contention of appellants is that this execution is void having been issued without authority of law the decree of the court reciting that by consent of parties by counsel no execution shQuld issue for a period of nine months from its date If the de cree for money had been conditional no execution could have issued upon it until it became operative but such is not the case The decree against Fulkerson is complete in all of its parts and the most that can be said is that an execution was issued upon it in contravention of the consent of parties entered of record Was an execution sued out under such circumstances void or voidable In Beales Admr v Botetourt Justices 10 Gratt 278 it was held that where in such an action a plea that the execution issued irregu larly and unlawfully after the expiration of more than a year and a day from the time of the decree without any previous proceeding by way of scire facias or otherwise to authorize the same such an irregularity would not render the execution void but only void able and it cannot be avoided by pleading or proof in thiq col lateral suit In that case the execution was issued contrary to law In this case it was contrary to the agreement of parties entered of record certainly not a stronger case than that from which we have quoted and we are of opinion that the execution being merely irregular and therefore only voidable it was effectual to prolong the life of the judgment and protect it from the operation of the statute of limitations Another objection taken to the judgment is that it was not duly recorded because the record does not in terms show that it was in dexed as required by law The bill alleges that this judgment was duly docketed in Judg ment Lie Docket No 2 page 168 on the 9th day of September 1887 as will more fully appear from an inspection of a certified transcript therefrom which is herewith filed as a part hereof marked Exhibit No 31 The exhibit referred to sets out the date of the judgment by what court rendered the time of docketing the names description and residence of the parties and the amount of the recovery1902 FULKERSON V TAYLOR 263 The answer of the defendant Wheeler admits the recovery of the judgment and supposes that the said judgment or decree was docketed in the judgment lien docket on the 9th day of December 1887 but of these facts respondent has no personal or peculiar knowledge and neither admits or denies the same but calls for full and complete proof thereon Section 3559 of the Code requires the clerks of the county and corporation courts to keep judgment dockets and provides what judgments shall be docketed therein Section 3560 is as follows In such docket there shall be stated in separate columns the date and amount of the judgment the names of all parties thereto the alternative value of any specific property recovered by it the date of docketing it the amount and date of any credit thereon the court in which or the justice by whom it was rendered and when paid off or discharged in whole or in part the time thereof and by whom such payment or discharge was made where there is more than one defendant Section 3561 directed that every judgment shall as soon as it is docketed be indexed by the clerk in the name of each defendant and shall not be regarded as docketed as to any defendant in whose name it is not so indexed Before the passage of the section just quoted it had been held in Old Dominion Granite Co v Clarke etc 28 Gratt 617 that the indexing was no part of the docketing of the judgment It is now expressly provided by section 3561 that no judgment shall be re garded as docketed as to any defendant in whose name it is not so indexed The bill having averred that the judgment under con sideration had been dulv docketed is to be taken as averring all that is necessary to render the docketing effectual to perfect the judgment lien The answer calling for proof of docketing put the averment of the bill in issue and exhibit No 31 which is the only proof offered sets out in detail all that is required to be stated in section 3560 but does not state specifically that the judgment had been indexed as required by section 3561 nor does there appear in that exhibit any general statement broad enough to cover the entire process of docketing including the indexing of the judg ment The bill to repeat what we have said alleges that the judg ment was duly docketed If the certificate of the clerk had certified that the judgment was duly docketed the proof might well have been considered to be as broad as the allegation and as264 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Aug being sufficient to show that all had been done that was necessary to render the judgment lien effectual but such is not the case There is an enumeration of particulars which omits all mention of the indexing of the judgment and there is an absence of any gen eral statement broad enough to cover that requirement The Circuit Court was of opinion that the judgment had been in all respects duly docketed We are indisposed to pass finally upon the question and to decide against the validity of the lien of the judgment We are of opinion that under the circumstances the case should be remanded to the Circuit Court with leave to the parties to introduce further evidence upon this subject Having reached this conclusion it would be premature to say anything with respect to the scope and operation of the lien Whether or not a judgment lien binds improvements in the hands of an alienee is a question of much interest and importance one which has not been directly passed upon by this court and which we feel should not be decided except after full argument and careful consideration We are of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court should be reversed and a decree entered remanding the cause for further proceedings to be had in accordance with this opinion Reversed NOTEThe ruling of the court in this casethat since a judgment is not duly docketed unless indexed the statute so declaring it is incumbent on one whose rights rest upon the fact of docketing to allege and prove the indexing suggests to practitioners and to clerks the importance of havingthe abstract of judgment show on its face the indexing as well as the docketing We believe this is not now customarynor is it common practice to allege the indexing in the plaintiffs bill or petition The court in the principal case decides that the allegation that the judgment was duly docketed is sufficient but with the qualification that under this allegation there must be affirmative proof that the judgment was both docketed and indexed This seems correct As to the necessity of indexing registered deeds see  Synopsis of Becent Acts of Assembly elsewhere published The action of the court in remanding the cause for further proof on this sub ject exemplifies the liberal practice in equity where justice is rarely sacrificed to forms and is in striking contrast with proceedings at law where there are pitfalls at every turn and where a slip may prove fatal to a cause ever so just The court is to be again commended for its keen appreciation of the bene volent principle of subrogation Practitioners whose experiences antedate the Code of 1887 will recognize the application in this case of the once famous doctrine of Floyd 7 Harding 28 Gratt 401though not cited1902 HANCOCK V WHITEHALL TOBACCO WAREHOUSE CO 265 The ruling that an execution issued in violation of the stipulation of the parties is notwithstanding sufficient to repel the bar of the statute is impor tant Reasoning merely from principle a different conclusion might be reached No man should be permitted to reap a benefit from his own wrong But the authorities are overwhelmingly in favor of the rule adopted by the court that an execution issued contrary to the stipulation of the parties is voidable only and not void and hence is not subject to collateral attack 1 Freeman Execu tions 26 Cody v Quinn 6 Ired N C 193 44 Am Dec 75 Bacon v arop sey 7 N Y 195

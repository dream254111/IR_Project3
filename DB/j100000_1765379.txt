j100000,Science,1765379,Periodicity of the Aurora,i300622,250 SCIENCE soon as the current reached the ground the wet earth being a good conductor 2 Why did not the lightning strike the trees on the summit rather than one several feet below and why not the top of the latter  3 Why did it indent the pipes and why the edges facing the current rather than the other Is electricity material  Can any thing not material manifest such a vis viva or working energy  Why was the iron melted when electricity has no inherent heat 4 Do not the effects at the junctions of the pipes indicate a sort of damming up of the current by the cement until the pressure became sufficient to burst the barrier and then it struck the fol lowing edge with its accumulated flood  MARSHALL HENSHAW Amherst Mass Apr 21 The phenomena presented in lightning strokes have hereto fore appeared so lawless that it may be well to call attention to the fact which has been repeatedly observed that but little dam age is generally done to portions of trees on the same levels as the foliage It has also been observed that the presence on any level of a conductor of considerable surface and consequent large electrical capacity mitigates the effects on that level Whether the large conducting surface presented by the wet leaves of a tree is a parallel case is of course a question but the fact as VOL XIX No 482 stated is among those well authenticated in regard to lightning effectsEd Periodicity of the Aurora ON Saturday night April 23 there was a fine Aurora seen in this locality whenever the clouds broke away until after midnight This display is specially interesting because it is the sixth consecu tive return of an aurora at the precise interval of twentyseven days the dates being as follows Dec 9 Jan 5 Feb 2 Feb 29 March 27 and April 23 The display will be due again upon May 20 It has been associated with reappearances at the suns eastern limb of an area south of the equator which has been much fre quented by spots and faculm In like manner a record now be fore me shows that reappearances at the eastern limb of disturbed areas in the suns northern hemisphere have their chief magnetic effect during the autumn months From this it would seem that in order that a solar disturbance may affect the earths magnetism it must be in a particular location namely at the eastern limb and as near as possible to the plane of the earths orbit Certainly such disturbances do not have their magnetic effect promiscuously in all locations or at present we should have auroras and magnetic storms continuously which is very far from being the case M A VEEDER Lyons NY April 25 CALENDAR OF SOCIETIES Philosophical Society Washington April 23G M Searle On a Simple Form of DoubleImage Micrometer

ex tracted and translated from the Latin by William Watson F R S T H I S learned and ingenious Per formance in Two Volumes in Folio contains a Dedication to the P R I N C E of W A L E S a Preface and 794 Pages Read Feb 3 17423 In the Preface the Author first lays down a Geo graphical Account of Switzerland being situate from 46 to 48 Degrees in Latitude and Four Degrees in Longitude then mentions its various and almost surprising Degress of Heat and Cold within the Space of a few Miles arising from the different Arrange ment of the Mountains That it is in some Parts destitute both of Corn and Wood from the Intense ness of the Cold in others where there are high Moun370 Mountains to the North and Openings to the South the reflected Heat becomes so troublesome that the Inhabitants are forced to desert the Towns and take Shelter in the Woods that in other Parts the Coun try is so extremely pleasant that Tavernier himself though he had travelled over great Part of the Globe declared he never had observed any more beautiful The Author then mentions that the Plants produced in such Difference of Soils and Situations must be very numerous he accordingly met with not only many of the Plants of the warmer Parts of France almost all the German ones but even those of Lap land and Spitzberg These Varieties have been col lected in a short time You gather in the same Day the Bistorts and Saxifrages which Martens collected in Spitzberg the yellow Milfoil Xeranthemum Ephedra and other Ornaments of the Southern Part of France The Progression between both Extremes is so regular that in going from Bern to Grimsul you pass first by Chesnuttrees and other Inhabitants of the warm Countries then Vines then Walnut trees then Beeches and Oaks then Firs then Larchtrees then Pines then barren Heaths pro ducing Whortleberries and suchlike then Rocks and Plants a Span high and last of all beyond which Vegetation ceases you meet with a Species of round leaved Willow not exceeding an Inch in Height and the hairy Crowfoot of Platerus beyond this Di strict the Tops of the Mountains are covered with Snow This great Variety is not as it must be in any other Part of the World the Collection of many Provinces but furnished within the Space of 17 Leagues and would be still less if in going from Se371 Sedunum you ascend Mount Sanetch whose Top is but seven Leagues from Sedunum or Syon The Author adds that the Sides of the Mountains produce great Variety of Mosses and Funguss that the Pastures furnish an inexpressible Collection of Grasses of which in this Book he mentions 220 Spe cies The following Kinds of Plants seem to be wanting in Switzerland viz the hotter Kind such as Thyme Lavender and Rosemary those very fre quent in champain Countries those which are pro duced in Bogs and putrid Soil some of those peculiar to the North and maritime Plants The Alps contain about 500 Species peculiar to themselves all diverse perennial most of them biting scented and frequently with a white Flower besides many Plants common to other Places The Author then proceeds to enumerate all the Botanists who by their Journals and Publications have laboured to oblige the World with Histories and Descriptions of the almost inexhaustible Number of Plants which the various Soil and Situation of this Country produces and after having mentioned the Performances of these great Men he gives some Ac count of his own Travels and the Progress of his botanical Studies that he had gone through Ger many Holland France and England and made very few Observations of the botanic kind at least had preserved no Specimens of what he had seen but upon his Arrival at Basil to attend the Lectures of Bernoulli and study Mathematics there he was seized as it were by the Genius of the Place where those great Writers the Bauhins had lived and were public Professors and whose Chair at that Time B b b was372 was very worthily filled by Starhelinus That he began to collect describe and compile with so great Hopes of Success however remote that he even at tempted the Work before us at a time when he was scarcely acquainted with the more common Plants A Work of this kind had been begun by John Gesner of Zurich a Descendant of the famous Con rad Gesners and a Friend of our Authors for which Task he was very well qualified by his many laborious Researches but at length his bad State of Health would not permit him to proceed in a Science where he must not be confined only to his Closet but climb up almost inaccessible Mountains some times nearly perishing with Cold and possibly in the same Day almost stifled with Heat This Gen tleman not only sent our Author a great many Plants but granted him whatever he had occasion for of his Collection which consisted of a great Number of valuable Specimens of which he alone was possessed Our Author specifies likewise what Parts of the Alps have been looked over and what remain hitherto unattempted and then shews how large a Field is yet behind for future Botanists to exercise their Genius upon and that these Mountains have rather been cursorily passed over by Persons travelling over them to remote Places often at an improper Season than carefully examined from whence it happens that many not only of Mosses but of the most perfect Plants have either been omitted or so negligently described that it is impossible to reduce them to the Genus to which they belong Add to this that the Funguss and the very small Plants such as the Centunculus Sedum tetrapetalon c were over looked373 looked by the antient Botanists and seem to have been reserved for the Industry and Perspicuity of the Vaillants Dilleniuss and Michelis of the present Age Our Author then candidly confesses that al though he had herborized upon many different Parts of this Country for Nine Years he could by no means promise a full and perfect Enumeration of its Plants for the Descriptions of the more antient Wri ters especially the Grasses mentioned by Caspar Bauhin are so obscure that it is scarcely possible to know many of them by those means that some Plants are inserted by Authors which have occurred to no body since their Time that others if not quite lost he never could meet with notwithstanding he travelled for that Purpose to the Places where they have been said to be found which may in some measure be owing to our Authors being shortsighted from which Defect he believes he may no doubt have passed over some Plants which he had been particularly in quest of That he had received some Specimens so ill preserved as not to be able to dis cover their generical Marks and lastly that it is almost impossible to save any Seeds of the Plants of the Alps or see them in that State on account of the Snows falling so early as the latter End of Au gust and Beginning of September whereby the Moun tains are covered and rendered unpassable Surrounded with Difficulties he despairs of per fecting his Catalogue but hopes he shall have the Readers Pardon after he is apprised of the Means our Author took against them First he carefully marked out the Characters of all his Plants the Day he collected them for not being prejudiced in favour B b b 2 of374 of any artificial Method he looked over the Compo sition of the Flower with regard to its Petals Calyx and Seedvessel after the manner of Professor Boer haave at a Time when nobody had considered the Stamina and Tubes as generical Notes That he compared with his Plants the botanical Writers of more than Two Centuries whose Names are men tioned at the End of the Preface beginning in order of Time with Brunfelsius and concluding with the late Work of Monsieur Geoffroy That he had exa mined their Descriptions of Plants and compared them with their Figures and made himself a Pinax of the Plants of Switzerland even to the present Time Our Author in the Work before us has never in serted a doubtful Plant without mentioning his Scruple nor any but what he himself has seen with out an Asterisk He has added to the End of the Work those which he could with but little Cer tainty refer to any Class and contrary to the Prac tice of some late Writers he never enumerates Vari ety nor ever regards Proportion as a Mark of specific Difference if even a less Plant produces Flowers twice as big as a larger Plant of the same Species and holds that Size when planted in Gardens and con tinues the Difference to its Posterity As to the Method and Order of this Work our Author has been as short and at the same time as descriptive as possible He has given the Syno nymes of most good Authors He generally first affixes the Name the Discoverer gave it unless a very im proper one and then proceeding usually as the Au thors lived sets down the Appellations of Conrad Gesner375 Gesner Cordus Dodoneus Lobel Tabernemont anus Hortus Aichstadiensis of Basil Besler Clusius Caspar and John Bauhin Morrisson Tournefort and others who have lived since them either as they have dis covered a new Plant or illustrated an old one with a new Description Figure or Character With regard to Method he says he might have disposed them alphabetically followed Boerhaaves Method or Linneuss but was fearful of making unnatural Distor tions especially as he was not writing an universal History of Plants He thinks it not at all proper to dispose Plants in the same Class unless their Affinity is perfect and lays it down as a Foundation upon which alone a natural Method can be formed that however different Plants may seem in one Character istic those should be placed together which agree in most others and however alike they may be in one Point that those be separated which differ in many others The Neglect of this Axiom has made all Methods unnatural The Author then apologizes for giving new Names to some Plants but he could not omit in serting some that were more expressive and give them the Preference to old ones that imported little or nothing although they had the Sanction of Anti quity but he scarce ever has changed the generical Names because amongst things that are in themselves indifferent Custom should be always complied with and as all generical Names are arbitrary scarce any can be thought of to contain enough to distinguish the Plant by but the specific Name ought to be a short Definition and Compendium of its niccst Differences And although this may sometimes be thought too long376 long the Marks of Difference in many kinds will not permit them to be contracted After he has acquainted the Reader with his Ob jections and told his Reasons he proceeds to that Part of his Work which is intituled Nomina Scrip torum  Editionum and has given a Specimen of his great Erudition in a very laborious and learned History of almost all Botanical Authors for more than Two Centuries He therein points out their Excellencies and Defects shews which of them were Originals and which Plagiaries gives an Account of all their Publications and Editions and deduces the Rise and Progress of Botany through all its Stages from the general Darkness of the 15th Century to the nice Distinctions of the present Time This may be esteemed a very valuable Performance It may not be improper to exhibit from it the different Characters of Two Books in the Authors own Words whereby some Judgment may be formed of the rest First mentioning Clusii rariorum Stirpium per Hi spaniam observatarum he says  Cordus was restored  to the World in Clusius He with incredible  Labour collected the Plants of Spain Languedoc  England the Alps Austria some Parts of Hun  gary and those about Frankfort He afterwards  drew them and published their Figures very ex  pressively and with great Neatness He alone  doubled the Number of Plants before known  although indeed many have been attributed to him  which are concealed in the Works of Cordus  Aretius and Gesner Our Author afterwards speaking of Fabregous Description des Plantes qui naissent autour de Paris says  Nothing can be  more377  more audacious than this Writer he often quar  rels with good Authors and obtrudes upon them  long since dead arbitrary Definitions proposed by  himself The Synonymes of his Plants and the  Definitions of his Species are very much confused  He takes with the utmost Impudence the Names  of Vaillant and Tournefort but with ridiculous  Alterations Besides to my great Abhorrence he  inserts a very great Number of Plants most cer  tainly Exotic as growing about Paris and lest  any thing should be wanting to spoil this Work  the typographical Errors are infinite Before I give an Account of our Authors System of Botany it will be necessary to mention the different Parts of Plants from which other Authors have formed theirs Conrad Gesner was the first who dis covered that Plants might be distinguished into Ge nera from their different manner of bearing Fruit as appears by his posthumous Letters published by Ca merarius but Cesalpinus first reduced it into Prac tice Cesalpinus I say Ray Herman whose Plan is much improved by Boerhaave and Knauts Sy stems are formed from the Fruit Tourneforts from the Figure of the Flower Rivinuss which is fol lowed by Ruppius from the Number and Equality of the Petals Magnols from the Calyx Linneuss from the Stamina Pistillum and Sex of the Flower and our Author his principally from the Number and Disposition of the Stamina and likewise from the manner of Fruiting I have at the End of this Extract abridged it according to the Order of the Classes Genera and Species Through378 Throughout the Body of this Work our Author has ranged his Plants after this Method and when he mentions a particular Plant he first gives the generical Name and its Inventor then lays down the Form of the Flower and the Manner of distinguish ing this Plant from others of the same Species then quotes the Synonymes then the Place of its natural Growth afterwards the Description of its Root and Leaves and lastly collects all the Evidence on both Sides with regard to its Uses as a Medicine or the contrary I think it not improper to give here Part of the History of one Plant as a Specimen of the rest The Author speaking p 298 of Veratrum or white Hellebore of the Shops after mentioning the generical Name Form of the Flower 29 Sy nonymes of different Writers the Place of Growth and the Form of its Root says  This Plant is  universally agreed to be hurtful though Brassa  vola p 531 found some People hardy enough  to give a Drachm at a Dose without any Cor  rector which Dose even Welsch and Herman  have allowed in Infusion to Daemoniacs also  Matthiolus p 1222 with good Success to Lu  natics Hermann in like Cases gives the Root  in Substance from 15 to 30 Grains Notwith  standing which we find in the Ephemerides na  turae curios Anno 1 mo Obs 65 that One Scruple  has certainly produced Convulsions and Wepfer  mentions a Dog killed with the same Dose and  Fallopius de Purgant likewise many strangled  therewith Lentilius p 868 takes Notice of  violent Vomitings occasioned by the Roots being  given by Mistake instead of Solomonsseal The  Acta379  Acta Hafn Anno v Observ 55 say that those  most hardy Mortals who live in the Northern  Parts of the World and purge themselves with  this Plant receive great Mischief in their Eyes  therefrom even sometimes to be followed by  Blindness See also its terrible Effects in the Breslau  Transactions Anno 1725 Even amongst the An  tients notwithstanding that both sorts of Hellebore  were produced in Anticyra the black was only  made use of in Purges on account of the emetic  Quality of the white See Pausanias Lib X pag  623 Alleyne will scarcely admit it to be safe  given in Powder as a Sternutatory But if the  Juice of this Plant with its full Powers shall by  any Method get into the Blood it is so quick a  Poison that the Animal immediately dies if  wounded even in a slight manner and the Juice  applied thereto See Crato Epist II pag 226  Matthiolus found this Experiment true upon Hens  See pag 1226 Epistolar pag 219 And that the  Putrefaction excited thereby was so great that the  Flesh immediately was grown soft See Arceus de  Curand Vuln Lib 1 pag 70 Nor does the Cause  seem to be obscure seeing that the Roots being  chewed fire the Mouth and Throat and pour  forth a very sharp Liquor not unlike that of Lime  Geoffroy de Mat Medic Vol II p 226 But Con  rad Gesner in the Work published by himself  assures us that his Oxymel Elleboratum may be  given to Two Drachms without any Mischief and  that it is very useful to promote the Menses Ex  pectoration and Sweat C c c This380 This may serve as a Specimen of our Authors great Industry and Exactness which he adheres to throughout the whole Work where a Plant has by any whether antient or modern medical Writer or Historian been celebrated for medicinal Purposes or its Uses in the Art of Dying His Descriptions are so exact that it is almost impossible that any Person ever so little conversant with Botany should mistake one Plant for another His Figures of which there are 24 Tables are finely engraved and with great Accuracy as appears from comparing them with their Descriptions His Method is very natural and not difficult to comprehend when considered though at first View it seems more so than Rays Tourneforts or Boerhaaves And indeed there have been already so many Botanical Systems such warm Controversies among Authors so many bad Names such great Con fusion that as often as there appears a new System it sends forth a Panic throughout the Botanical World as it adds to the Number of Names already too great and tends to the Discouragement of those who are desirous of being acquainted with Plants But our Authors System being as I said before very natural and as he gives but few new generical Names and at the same time when he gives his own mentions those of most good Authors these Considerations take off many Objections to which some late Botanic Writers are liable In the Work before us the Author takes in only the Plants of Switzerland but I believe his Plan may be extended to a general History which if executed with the same Accuracy as the present Work cannot but be a most valuable Performance 1 Plantae

great merits as a master of technical botany he will always live in the pages of history as one of the group of men immediately asso ciated with Darwin The personalities of Darwin Hooker Huxley and Wallace stand out in the history of biological science in such a manner that they are never likely to be forgotten On the contrary because they will be taken as typical of a movement and a period they will increase rather than diminish in the estimation of mankind They will have the value of a moral force veritable saints of science patterns for all later genera tions In strict equity it may be that Hooker should not stand on so high a pedestal as we shall place him but we are concerned rather with our needs than his deserts Under these circumstances an authoritative and full account of the life of Sir Joseph Hooker becomes a necessity This work written by Leonard Huxley and based on materials collected and arranged by Lady Hooker has just been published in two vol umes and is the subject of this notice It is the story of a long life of incessant activity devoted to the classification and description of plants the administration of a great botanical establishment and to explorations in distant regions In 1837 Hooker published the de scriptions of three new mosses in 1911 he published a number of new species of Im patiens Such a record is surely unique It seems strange to think that this man whose living presence is still vividly in our mind knew four of the founders of the Linnean Society and talked with Humboldt There is an amusing account of his first meeting with Humboldt in Paris On putting up here I sent in my card with Mr Browns books to Baron Humboldt he was not at home but sent his flunkey Scotiel Footman to my bedroom at eight oclock yesterday morning to say his master wished to see me at nine oe1lock Ten minutes after his Lord had grown impatient and sent to say he was all ready so I went in and saw to my horror a punchy Ulttle German instead of a Humboldt There was no mistaking his head however which is exceedingly like all the por traits though now powdered with white I ex pected to see a fine fellow six feet without his boots who would make as few steps to get up COhmborazo as thoughts to solve a problem I oan not now at all fancy his trotting along the Cor dillera as I once supposed he would have stalked However he received me most kindly and made a great many enquiries about all at Kew and in England Later on Hooker was able to emulate Hum boldt in the exploration of mountains but on the other side of the worldcin the Himalayas The story of his Indian work is well known but is of perennial interest He did much more than explore new regions and find new plants India is indebted to him for much of her scientific development and material pros perity When he went there he found the government singularly apathetic as regards science He went out with Lord Dalhousie the governorgeneral who took a fancy to him and treated him very kindly but had no inter est in botany In a letter home he relates I find Lord Dalhousie an extremely agreeable and intelligent man in everything but natural his tory and science of which he has a lamentably low opinion I fear He is a perfect specimen of the miserable system of education pursued at Oxford and as ignorant of the origini and working of our most common manufacturing products and arts as he is well informed on all matters of finance policy etc I very carefully drop a little knowl edge into him now and then but I can not awaken an interest or any sympathy in my pursuits he is much pleased at my being busy and especially with my carrying on my meteorological register three times a day Lady Dalhousie shares her husband s apathy but is otherwise a kind hearted creature In the desert I brought them the gum arabic Acacia which I thought must interest the late president of the board of trade but he chucked it out of the carriage window and the rose of Jericho with an interest about it of a totally dif ferent character met no better fate On his return from India and indeed while he was still there he contemplated a Flora Indica to contain descriptions of all known Indian plants In a letter to his father he wrote it is easy to talk of a Flora Indiea and Thomson and I do talk of it to imbeciltyl But 526 SCIENCEJUNE 6 1919 SCIENCE suppose that we even adopted the size quality of paper brevity of description etc which charac terized De Oandolles prodromus and we should even under these conditions fill twelve such vol umes at least   about eighteen years fair work would be needed He then asks how is such an undertaking to be supported neither our government nor the East India Company will give a sum in any way proportional to the work But the idea was never given up and in 1897 after an interval of about fifty years Hooker saw the publication of the last volume of  The Flora of British India This he regarded as only a beginninga preliminary assembling of scattered materialsand during the last years of his life he incessantly urged Indian botanists to study the living plants and revise every part of the  Flora His own work on the Balsaminacese carried on after he was ninety years old represented the beginning of such a revision To the last Hooker retained his special interest in the people of India as well as its  Flora Thus in the year of the coronation of King Edward VII As I was at the Waterloo Station yesterday four Indian regiments filed past methey sent the blood flying to my finger tips such grand fellows and such gentlemen such proud yet pleasant faces such an air of dignity and selfrespect In the Himalayas he did some geological work which later proved of more value than he had anticipated But when he studied fossil plants he did not consider that he was leaving his special botanical field I am no geologist my work is fossil botany as legit imately a branch of Botany as is muscology fossil plants though imperfect are still pure plants and though dead as species they form and show links between existing forms upon which they throw a marvellous light Later on he came to be very skeptical about the value of much of the work of the paleobotan ists and in 1887 expressed himself thus It is an ugly fact that tempting as is the study of fossil botany every competent botanist with a large knowledge of existing floras and that has tried his hand on it has given it up notably 527 Brown Brongniart and Lindley or these have sub sequently confined themselves to specimens exhibit ing structure as fossil wood etcwhilst Oliver Bentham etc have only shaken their heads when asked to identify a fossil plant If you are ever at the Herbarium and will look at the multitudes of figures of leaves in Gardner Lesquereux and other works the vagueness of the identifications will strike you at once There ds a standing joke at the Herbarium Kew if you have a plant the affinities of which puzzle you fossilize it and send it to a paleontologist and he will give you the genus and species at once As materials accumulated at Kew and Hooker found before him long series of speci mens from numerous localities he recognized many intermediates between supposedly dis tinct species Thus he was led to make great allowances for variation becoming what is sometimes called a  lumper Darwin called his attention to the probability that many of the observed intermediates might actually be hybrids and in a characteristic letter he replied The dismal fact that you quote of hybrid transi tions between Verbascum thapss and nigrum or whichever two it was and its bearing on my prae tise of lumping species through intermediate specimens is a very horrible one and would open my eyes to my own blindness if nothing else could I have long been prepared for such a case though I once wrote much against its probability I feel tolerably sure I must have encountered many such but have not had the tact to discern them when under my nose and hence I feel as if all my vast experience in the field has been thrown away It seems almost unbelievable today that after Hookers splendid work on the Antarctic floras and Indian explorations he should have been so hard put to find a means of living by botany that he was advised to abandon the subject He was told that there was a vacancy in the mineralogical department at the British Museum and To be sure I know nothing of crystallography mineralogy chemistry etc but the trustees are above such prejudice against a man who could wear a white neckeloth with ease and take his fair share of their abuses with equanimity which would be an allpowerful testimonial I hate the ideaN S VOL XLIX No 1275 of giving up botany but I am advised to try for it by Gray particularly and my father proposes it A few years later 1854 he said I sometimes think seriously of giving up Kew and living in London and writing for the press But it could not be and when his friend Bentham had similar doubts he wrote If I thought you would be a happier man I would advise you to give up botany but you would not be so and evil as our days are whether they mended or worsed it would be all the worse to you to have given up what is at least a wholesome and constant mental resource I sometimes despond too but as I was once told I am limed to the twig and so are you The names of Bentham and Hooker authors of the Genera Plantarum will always re main united in scientific literature The per sonal association of the two men was all that could be desired a result of their common interests and high character Hooker writing to the botanist Harvey in 1856 takes occasion to say Bentham s unselfish love of science always charms me he has never a thought of personal aggrandize ment in money o honor but indeed we have both of us lived under the highest examples and happiest influences in these respects My father Bentham nand Thomson are such a trio as we shall never see again Except Faraday and Darwin I know of no others in the walks of science so pure and disinterested except perhaps Asa Gray in America In 1860 Hooker settled down to the work on Genera Plantarum and wrote to Huxley We are not likely to meet except at the Linnean for I have inaugurated a new era in my life and ama going to take the world and all that is therein as coolly as I can When perfect myself I shall commence operating on you What is the use of tearing your life to pieces before you are fifty which you are and I was doing as fast as pos sible Huxleys reply is so good and so pertinent just now that it must be cited at length And finally as to your resolutions my holy pil grim they will be kept about as long as the reso lutions of anchorites who are thrown into the busy world Or I wont say that for assuredly you will take the work as coolly as you can and so shall I But that coolness amounts to the red heat of properly constructed mortals It is no use having any false modesty about the matter You and I if we last ten years longer and you by a long while firstwill be the repre sentatives of our respective lines in the country In that capacity we shall have certain duties to perform to ourselves to the outside world and to science We shall have to swallow praise which is no great pleasure and to stand multitudinous bastings and irritations which will involve a good deal of unquestionable pain Dont flatter your self that there is any moral chloroform by which either you or I can render ourselves insensible or acquire the habit of doing things coolly It is assuredly of no great use to tear ones life to pieces before one is fifty But the alternative for men constituted on the high pressure tubular boier ptinciple like ourselves is to lie stilland let the devil have his own way And I will be torn to pieces before I am forty sooner than see that Hookers correspondence with Harvey brings out some of his general ideas in an interesting way He observes how the habit of precision grows until it becomes in a sense detrimental to progress The besetting sin of the botanists of the day is the craving for perfect materials forgetful that these sciences are all progressive and our efforts but steps in the progression   I would urge you to think now of putting together some of your ideas and facts on wider branches than purely de scriptive I think that this becomes a duty after a certain time of life with those who keep such subjects before themtoo much of our dear bought experience dies with us and the pursuit of careful descriptive botany rather renders us too timid about striking out into generalities that are the product of years of insensibly gained ideas It is unnecessary to recount here Hookers part in relation to the publication of Darwins theory or in connection with the spread of evolutionary ideas but there is a little bit of personal history which is as interesting as it is amusing We have all heard of the famous debate on evolution at the meeting of the British Association when the Bishop of Ox ford and Huxley crossed swords before an ex cited audience It has not been generally understood that Hooker had a conspicuous 528 SCIENCEJUNE 6 1919 SCIENCE part in this affair and his own account of it written at the time in a letter to Darwin is as follows Well Sam Oxon got up and spouted for half an hour with inimitable spirit ugliness and emptiness and unfairness I saw he was coached up by Owen and knew nothing and he said not a syllable but what was in the Reviews he ridiculed you badly and Huxley savagely Huxley answered admirably and turned the tables but he could not throw his voice over so large an assembly nor command the audience and he did not allude to Sams weak points nor put the matter in a form or way that carried the audience The battle waxed hot Lady Brewster fainted the excitement increased as others spoke my blood boiled I felt myself a dastard now I saw my advantage I swore to myself that I would smite that Amalekite Sam hip and thigh if my heart jumped out of my mouth and I handed my name up to the president Henslow as ready to throw down the gauntlet I must tell you that Henslow as president would have none speak but those who had arguments to use and four persons had been bunked by the audience and president for mere declamation it moreover became necessary for each speaker to mount the platform and so there I was cocked up with Sam at my right elbow and there and then I smashed him amid rounds of applause I hit him in the wind at the first shot in ten words taken from his own ugly mouth and then proceeded to demonstrate in as few more 1 that he could never have read your book and 2 that he was absolutely ignorant of the rudiments of Botanical Science I said a few more on the subject of my own experience and conversion and wound up with a very few observations on the relative positions of the old and new hypotheses and with some words of caution to the audience Sam was shut up had not one word to say in reply and the meeting was dissolved forthwith leaving you master of the field after four hours battle Huxley who had borne all the previous brunt of the battle and who never before thank God praised me to my face told me it was splendid and that he did not know before what stuff I was made of I have been congratulated and thanked by the blackest coats and whitest stocks in Oxford Henslow best remembered as the teacher and friend of Darwin at Cambridge was Hookers fatherinlaw The latters respect and affection for him were unbounded He writes to Huxley from Henslows deathbed 529 I am utterly overwhelmed to be loved as he was for the good he had done I would lay down my science and almost turn parson To me personally the loss will be inmeasurablehe took interestin everything I did and I loved himI am wrong to think how much His loss to this neighborhood will be incalculable there is none to take his place morally socially or religiously Hookers attitude toward Darwin was that of a disciple Although Darwin always looked up to Hooker as his master and guide in all matters botanical the latter could un affectedly write in this delightful strain The whole thing i e Hookers masterly work on Welwitschia is however a dry record of singular structures and sinks down to the level of the dullest descriptive account of dead matter be side your jolly dancing facts anent orchidlife and beelife I have looked at an Orchid or two since reading the Orchid book and feel that I never could have made out one of your points even had I limitless leisure zeal and material I am a dull dog a very dull dog I may content myself with the per contra reflection that you could not be dull enough to write a Genera Plantarum which is just about what I am best fitted for I feel I have a call that way and you the other I In his early days Hooker took an interest in entomology and he recurs more than once to the relationship between insects and plants as having an important bearing on the larger problems of botany Since he had no time for entomology it is regrettable that he did not have a group of entomological friends to work on the problems he so often had in mind The bees of high altitudes in the Himalayas noticed by Hooker were first studied and de scribed from the collections of the Thibet Mission fiftyfive years later Darwins orchid book suggested to him That insects may have a wonderful deal more to do with checking migration than climate or geographies and that the absence of whole genera may thus one day be accounted for by absence of genera of insects in short the cat and clover story is capable of immediate expansion by any one hav ing sufficient knowledge of plants insects and geography Also as regards the pastN S VOL XLIX No 1275 I quite believe in the sudden development of the mass of phanerogams being due to the introduction of flowerfeeding insects While fully alive to the importance of lab oratory researches Hooker felt that nothing could take the place of a knowledge of the various kinds of plants in nature and that after all the whole was in a sense greater than its parts In 1886 he writes to Asa Gray I am more and more absorbed in Indian botany and have thrown aside all idea of making headway withany desire to keep up with evenheads of chemicobotany and microphytology I may con tent myself with a casual grin at young men call ing themselves botanists who know nothing of plants but the innards of a score or so The pendulum will swing round or rather back one day In 1894 he recurs to the same subject and writes to Francis Darwin I am glad you are going to teach the medicos a little practical botany It is lamentable to find that all this botanical teaching of the greatest universities in England and Scotland does not turn out a single man who can turn his botanical knowl edge to any use whatever to his fellow creatures Where should we be if medicine law or any other pursuit were taught after that fashion In his general ideas of education he was modern in the sense of desiring practical vocational training and in his indignation against the claims of the classicists But he seems to have had little or no vision of an educated democracy nor indeed of democracy in any form He greatly admired certain characteristics of the Americans writing to Asa Gray as early as 1854 WWhen you Yankees take up the higher branches of botany more generally you will turn out far more and better work than we do for you are a far better educated sounder more practical peo ple and I look to you for the greatest discoveries come when they may And in 1877 after traveling across the United States with Asa Gray he wrote I had not the ghost of an adventure in America where I saw a prodigious deal and learnt much California was burnt up with nine months drought which obliterated the herbaceous vegeta tion and allowed me full time for the arboreous and frutieose I was charmed with New England disappointed with the Rloeky Mountains as a range and have no love for California but all are full of great interest and wonderful resources Niagara did not fdisappoinit me nor did the big trees  The people I found to be wonderfully nice and A Gray is a trump in all senses The following to W E Darwin in 1893 is singularly pertinent today I am dreamer enough to look for a time when America will forbid a European war What a splendid r0le this would be for a nation to under taketo send us all to our tents and tell us that we may snarl at one another in the length and breadth of Europe as much as we please but noth ing more and that if we go further she will inter vene Here we may leave this fascinating record of opinions and events having quoted freely but scarcely more than touched the treasures it contains To have read it following Hooker to the Antarctic the Himalayas the Atlas mountains and America visiting him through it at Kew and at his home all this is sufficient to stir the imagination and ambition of the most lethargic if he cares anything for science The book should be in all public libraries and it is permissible to hope that eventually a cheaper edition perhaps somewhat abbreviated may further widen the circle of its influence T D A COCKERELL UNIVERSITY OP COLORADO

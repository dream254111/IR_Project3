occasionally proposd to a Friend by R B E Fellow of the R Society London 1674 in 4o THIS Discourse is annexed to another entituled The Excellency of THEOLOGY compard with NATURAL PHILOSOPHY which though it be not of a direct ten dency to the design of these Tracts yet doth it occasionally mention divers things fit to be taken notice of by a Student of Natural Philosophy such as are the useful Hints and Dire ctions to guide him in the making Experiments skilfully and warily p 118 119 to encourage him to the Improvement of Natural Philosophy now that the Mechanical Hypothesis is sufficiently settled and the right Methods of Inquiring are found out p 171 to instruct him how injurious Systematical Writers are to the true search of Nature p 193 and what care is to be had of establishing Philosophical Hypotheses p 208 as also how much remains yet to be discoverd of Nature p 174 176 178 and how Philosophy hath recoiled by the Aristotelians laying aside Mathematicks and disputing of Generals p 204 and by whom the Experimental and Mathematical Way of Philosophizing hath been restored and brought54 brought into esteem p 205 206 Among which particulars there occur also several notable Considerations about the Na ture of Body and Sensation p144 145 153 and divers Instances of Philosophy improved p 209 210 211 not on ly in reference to the understanding of the sensible Qualities of things and their Causes p211212 but also as to Pra ctical Inventions and Instruments p 213 c But to pass to that Dissertation which is more within our Sphere viz Concerning the Excellency and Grounds of the Mechanical Hypothesis the Noble Author thereof maketh it his business to evince that the other Hypotheses entertaind by the several Sects of Philosophers are so far from overthrowing the Mechanical that they will either be foiled by it or found reconcileable to it In the doing whereof having first decla red his meaning about the subject discoursd of viz the Me chanical Philosophy he succinctly and plainly delivers the particulars that recommend it 1 Of the Principles of things Corporeal for such only he here treats of none can be more few without being insuffi cient or more primary than Matter or Motion 2 The natural and genuine effect of variously determind Motions in portions of Matter is to divide it into parts of different Sizes and Shapes and to put them into different Mo tions the consequences of which are Posture Order Scitu ation and peculiar Textures 3 The parts of Matter endowd with these Catholick affec tions are by various associations reduced to Natural Bodies of several kinds according to the plenty of the matter and the various Compositions and Decompositions of the Principles which all suppose the common Matter they diversisy And these several Kinds of Bodies by Vertue of their Motion Rest and other Mechanical Affections which fit them to act and to suffer become endowed with several Kinds of Qualities and with those that work upon the peculiarly framd Organs of Sense whose Perceptions by the animad versive Faculty of the Soul are Sensations 4 These Principles Matter MotionRest Bigness Shape Po sture Order Texture being so simple clear and comprehensive are by our Author shown to be applicable to all the real Phae nomena55 nomena of Nature which seem not explicable by any other not consistent with these For saith he if recourse be had to an Immaterial Principle it may be such an one as is not in telligible and however it will not enable us to explain the Phaenomena because its manner and way of working upon things Material would probably be more difficult to be Physi cally made out than a Mechanical account of such Effects And as to an Immaterial created Agent we cannot conceive how it should produce changes in a Body without the help of Mechanical Principles especially Local motion and ac cordingly we find not that the Reasonable Soul in Man is able to produce what changes it pleaseth in the Body but is confind to such as it may produce by determining or guiding the Motions of the Spirits and other Parts of the Body subservient to voluntary Motion 5 And if the Active Principles resorted to be not Imma terial but Corporeal they must either in Effect be the same with those lately mentiond or because of the great Universality and Simplicity of the same the New ones pro posd must be less general than they and consequently capable of being subordinated or reduced to those asserted by our Au thor which by various Compositions may afford matter to several Hypotheses and by several Conditions afford minute Concretions exceedingly numerous and durable and conse quently fit to become the Elementary Ingredients of more compounded Bodies being in most Trials Similar and as it were the Radical Parts which may after several manners be diversified as in a Language the Themes are by Praepositions Terminations c So that the fear that so much of a New Physical Hypothesis as is true will overthrow or make use less the Mechanical Principles is as if one should fear there will be a Language proposd that is discordant from or not reducible to the Letters of the Alphabet IIIN my last No 102 I promised a fuller account of Mr John Smiths ENGLANDS IMPROVEMENT revivd in a Treatise of Husbandry and Trade by Land and Sea plainly discovering the several ways of

better than was known to our Forefathers will the next following year be at easy rates to be had on all the Roads of England from the remotest Western Parts to London and a 100 Miles deep towards the

Book Anno 1633 he was sent by the Earl of Pembroke for the discovery of the Isle of Shetland to observe the manner of trading the profits and customs thereof the settling of a staple the building of storehouses the viewing of ground on shore for landing and drying of nets of the ordering and drying of fish the manner of the Hollanders fishing for herring with busses and with other vessels for ling and cod of all which he here publishes his Journal begin ning April 27 1633 And here he gives a particular account of the chief Islands about Scotland in all above 300 saith Speed and the author takes notice of more Islets than can easily be numbred Of the Hamburgers fishing on other Islands there What fish the inhabitants do catch and how The dangerous rocks and violent winds That Saltpans may be set up in Shetland and good salt made to serve all the fishing fleet p255 The Scots in Shetland were provided of hooks and lines for the taking of ling and cod nets for the ta king of herring strong beer biskets wheaten meal salt pease fruits of all sorts strong water Monmouth caps and many other particulars p 256 The inhabitants of the Isle of Ounst usually have a bark that they trade with to Norway where they may buy timber for houses ready framed dealboards tarr ships barks and boats of all sorts In59 In one of their small fishingboatsrowing with two mensome times with four they do usually bring to shore every morn ing that they go to sea 50 or 60 ling and cod and they take many barrels of herrings For the Hollanders busses driving at sea do break the shole and then the herrings fly near the shore through the sounds where the Scots take them with their small boats and nets Had they better tackling they would do better p 256 257 And which is more than all they have skilful and hardy fishers to endure wind and weather and to be content with their own provisioms Here a London purse or a full Englishpurse would do wonders and the time draws near to prepare for the business In Shetland they had then fat oxen at 3 l each oxe fat sheep at 2 f or 2 s 6 d each fat sheep conies easie to be taken in abundance and fowl c p 257 He bought in the Isle of Ounst 11655 gild ling of the largest size if smaller he had two for one or three for two and 835 gild cod which are the largest cod all taken by the inhabitants of Ounst all brought to his booth or the place of his abode as soon as they were caught every morning The large gild ling did cost him but 3 d apiece the gild cod but 2 d apiece They were salted aboard the ship p 254 Muffet values a ling of 2 years old at a Noble as the usual rate in his time about 60 years since or upwards and the price of flesh in London and other parts of England may now justly raise the price of fish Our Author goes on to shew that trading is the life of all the habitable world how it first raised the Venetians then the Genouese next the Portuguese then the Easterlings lastly the Hollanders above all by the fishery p 258 259 c He proves by accurate Instances and grounded Calculations that so long ago Hollanders and other Foreigners gained by their fishery from the coasts of England Scotland and Ire land to the value of millions of pounds yearly And hence is their abundance of shipping pilots and seamen And he shews how the Hollanders do exchange their fish to drive their main Trade and to circulate the wealth in the world into their own centers and purses Compare herewith Mr Evelyns lately publishd ingenious discourse of the Original and Progress of Navigation and Com merce especially p 107 108 109 c printed

be said here about the particulars contain ed in this treatise the publisher thinks himself obliged to observe to the reader a great mistake which the learned author of this book commits in ascribing these Philosophical Transacti ons to the Royal Society as if those of that illustrious body were the authors and composers of them whereas tis well known and hath been several times declared and inculcated in these very Tracts  that tis far otherwise and that none but one particular member of the said society is the composer and publisher of the same which being thus premised twill not be amiss further to take notice here of the occasion that hath been given to our author of writing this bookwhich seems to have been the last clause of the description formerly given in N 92 of these Tracts p 5192 concerning the preexistence of the fixt and alcali sate salts in mixts before calcination and the causes of volati lization both treated of by our author in his Epistle to Dr Langelot abbreviated in the said Number which doctrine of his that he might clear up the better he thought fit to de liver his opinion about the first principles of natural things which he endeavours to do in this treatise First By reject ing the four peripatetick Elements and the received Principles of the Chymists from being the first principles of natural bo dies  Secondly By asserting Elementary Water and Seeds to be the true princi ples of them and making such water the sole Material and the Seeds of bo dies the sole Formal principle and af firming these two so to concurr to the constitution of all corporeal beings that the former is the matter common to them all and the latter the form diversifying that indifferent matter into an innumerable variety of bodies by means of an universal celestial acid the proper seat of all seeds and coagulating this elementary water into the various  See Numb 12 p 213 Numb 86 p 5047  See and compare here with the Honourable R Boyles Sceptical Chymist throughout publishd Anno 1661 in English and Anno 1662 in Latin61 various bodies of the universe  Here he takes occasion to dis course largely of the nature of fire the better to evince how that de serveth to be counted a principle of natural bodies after he had af firmed that Acids which he ma keth to be fiery substances as they are the domicil of Seeds by their motion and coagulating power do diversify the common elementary Water into those vari ous bodies of which this world is made up Fire then according to him is a most swift motion of a Volatil acid sulphur the motion of particles being the Form of fire and the volatil acid parts the matter thats moved Where he maketh a digression to shew the Inebriating power of Acidsand how effectual Alcalies are to retund and mortifie that vertue Which done he proceeds to elucidate further the nature of fire from oyls and fats and to make it out by experiments that the matter of the flame of burning Oyls are their Acids parti cles for as much as oyls prepard by evaporating Spirit of wine from them or by abstracting them from quicklime or by distilling them even from bricks do not flame so much as they would do otherwise which way of preparing oyls he conceives to consist in nothing but the destruction of the Acid particles thereof observing further that candles made of muttonSuet burn away much sooner than those made of other Suet by reason of the abundance of acid particles in the same far exceeding those in other kinds of fat c Having dispatchd this argument he goes on to prove more fully firstthat the seeds of things are harbourd in some acidor other more or less manifest secondly that all bodies are from water coagulated into various speciess by seeds Where he in fers that that seminal acid of fats being consumd by flames the remainder now deprivd of that acid is resolvd into ele mentary water and insensibly dissipated into vapours as the a queous parts of the most rectified spirit of wine being put into flame fly away together with the spirit in vapour Where he takes no small pains to demonstrate as his expression is the aci dity of flame and withal to shew that in all inflamable bo dies  Quaere What is meant by this Elementary Water And Whe ther if it be Insipid Water or any how simple soever it seem may not be reducible into something else And what if this water here calld Ele mentary should be all converti ble into Earth As it hath been actually transmitted into it by Mr Boyle See his Book of the Origin of Forms and Qualities p 251 exp 9th62 dies there are acid particles that may justly be called fire and that there is such a fire in the stomach of all Animals and even in the ventricles of all Muscles for according to him every Muscle and part of the Body hath its peculiar ventricle or sto mach which impregnates the ailments conveyd to them with the seminal acid of the partwhereby the nourishment is turnd into the nature of this or that muscle or nerve vein artery or any other part And as this fire is by him placed in all Animals so he endeavours to prove it to be in all Minerals and Vegeta bles whereby the matter conveyd to them for their nourish ment and increase is according to the diversity of the Se minal acid sulphur converted into this or that mineral or plant Againin that part of this book where the author maketh it his business to prove that the Tria Prima of the Chymists are not the true principles of natural things he undertakes where he treats of that reputed principle Salt to bring clearer proof of what was formerly said in Num 92 of these Tracts not to have been sufficiently provd viz that the fixed alcalisate salts do as such by no means preexist in bodies before calcinations after he hath first distinguishd between the fixt tartareous salt that is in all the juyces of vegetables really and formally with out calcining them of which he saith he speaks not and the fixt Alcalisate salt of the tartar eg of wormwood which he po sitively affirms not to have formally preexisted in the body be fore calcination because he will have that produced by the col liquation made by the fire of the Volatile salts with the terre strial parts of the body and the union of the terretrial parts with the saline to be the sole cause of fixity as on tother hand he maketh the separation of those earthly parts the true and only reason of volatility Which whether he hath evinced by such ir refragable proofs as he thinks we must still leave to truly Phi losophical and sagacious chymists to judge and shall only take the liberty to demand whether he be sure that two acids may not without any terrestreity be so combined and brought into such a texture as to afford a fixt body that shall endure a con siderable degree of heat before it be sublimed or volatilized Which that they may we have hopes to find proved experi mentally in an Essay of Mr Boyle in due time to be publishd about the mechanical production of the qualities of Bodies As to the principles espoused by our author viz water and seeds63 Seeds and the large proofs he brings to assert them we shall here say nothing but desire the intelligent reader to com pare his whole discourse with that of the noble author of the considerations about the excellency and grounds of the mechanical hypothesis which we have already given some account of above Mean time we cannot but commend this philosopher for taking particular notice of that admirable work of nutriti on whereby for instance an Ox grows in all and every part of his whether it be muscular bony cartilaginous nervous c only by grass and plain water which passing in to the head heart lungs liver arms feet c do become each of those parts respectively and doing so give us to con sider that each part contains something peculiar that is not in any other part by means whereof the aliment conveyd thither is converted into the nature of eg the heart not the liver the lungs not the spleen c But how he comes to make such an estimate that that part of a seed in which properly the prolifique virtue lodgeth and which is strictly called the geniture is no more than the two thousand eight hundredth part 2800 of its body and who are all those genuin philosophers whom he appeals to p 173 264 I should be very glad to be informd of After he hath amply discoursed in general of the nature of seeds and the seminal idea or character he proceeds to particu larsapplying his general discourse to the generation of animals vegetables and minerals Of animals he taketh in hand the no blest of them Man and giveth a large account both of his for mation in the womb and his nutrition when brought into the world Where do occur many observables touching the active power of the seed of the Female the production of viviparous animals from eggs the manner of conception the gathering of the seed from all the parts of the animal and the imprinting of the particular characters of each part in the blood moving through the whole body and by the blood as a vehicle to the organs of generation further the cuase of the determinate sizes of animals especially of men pigmies and giants the strange force of imagination exemplified the sufficiency of the seed of the male to impregnate many eggs at once especially of a cock the cause of Monstrosity difference of fexes and death of the remaining of the ideas or characters in the bodies of animals64 animals after death to which he joyneth his thoughts about the resuscitation of plants Having finishd this part concerning generation he goes on to shew how nutrition is materially performd in all sorts of bodies viz by water alone which he endeavours to make out by reason and authority particularly alledging for his authority Van Helmont and Mr Boyle the latter of which I much apprehend to be misunderstood by our author in this particular as he is also mistaken by the same when he is intro duced as a person judging that Van Helmont for whom he hath yet a just esteem by reason of the incredible veracity of his experiments is not easily to be disbelievd for which allegation I think no place of Mr Boyle can be produced out of any of his works to run in that latitude And as this writer believes water to be the material prin ciple of all things so he attempts to shew what that power and virtue is which coagulateth the water into solid bodies and applieth it to these seminal characters which he had afore discoursed of and this he maketh to be the igne ous and vivisying spirit lodged by the creator in the sun and conveyd to the several bodies of the universe by the air and wind imbud with those vital and benign rays of of the solar globe which spirit though it be according to him but one and before it be incorporated indifferent to make faecund the bodies of all the three kingdoms yet it acquires its specification or is determined according to the determinate nature of the seeds and the most subtile parts of that spirit being acid they do by this acid power coagu late the water into solid bodies L O N D O N Printed for John Martyn Printer to the Royal Society 1674

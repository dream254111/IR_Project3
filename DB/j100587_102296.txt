J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,102296,AN EASIE DEMONSTRATION OF THE ANALOGY OF THE LOGARITHMICK TANGENTS TO THE MERIDIAN LINE OR SUM OF THE SECANTS WITH VARIOUS METHODS FOR COMPUTING THE SAME TO THE UTMOST EXACT NESS BY E HALLEY,I206884,202 AN EASIE DEMONSTRATION OF THE ANALOGY OF THE LOGARITHMICK TANGENTS TO THE MERIDIAN LINE OR SUM OF THE SECANTS WITH VARIOUS METHODS FOR COMPUTING THE SAME TO THE UTMOST EXACT NESS BY E HALLEY IT IS NOW NEAR 100 YEARS SINCE OUR WORTHY COUNTRYMAN MR EDWARD WRIGHT PUBLISHED HIS CORRECTION OF ERRORS IN NAVIGATION A BOOK WELL DESERVING THE PERUSAL OF ALL SUCH AS DESIGN TO USE THE SEA THEREIN HE CONSIDERS THE COURSE OF A SHIP ON THE GLOBE STEARING OBLIQUELY TO THE MERIDIAN AND HAVING SHEWN THAT THE DEPARTURE FROM THE MERIDIAN IS IN ALL CASES LESS THAN THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE IN THE RATIO OF RA DIUS TO THE SECANT OF THE LATITUDE HE CONCLUDES THAT THE SUM OF THE SECANTS OF EACH POINT IN THE QUADRANT BEING ADDED SUC CESSIVELY WOULD EXHIBIT A LINE DIVIDED INTO SPACES SUCH AS THE INTERVALS OF THE PARALLELS OF LATITUDE OUGHT TO BE IN A TRUE SEA CHART WHEREON THE MERIDIANS ARE MADE PARALLEL LINES AND THE RHOMBS OR OBLIQUE COURSES REPRESENTED BY RIGHT LINES THIS IS COMMONLY KNOWN BY THE NAME OF THE MERI DIAN LINE WHICH THOUGH IT GENERALLY BE CALLED MERCATORS WAS YET UNDOUBTEDLY MR WRIGHTS INVENTION AS HE HAS MADE IT APPEAR IN HIS PREFACE AND THE TABLE THEREOF IS TO BE MET WITH IN MOST BOOKS TREATING OF NAVIGATION COMPUTED WITH SUFFICIENT EXACTNESS FOR THE PURPOSE IT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY CHANCE AND AS FAR AS I CAN LEARN FIRST PUBLISHT BY MR HENRY BOND AS AN ADDITION TO NORWOODS EPITOME OF NAVIGATION ABOUT 50 YEARS SINCE THAT THE MERI DIAN LINE WAS ANALOGOUS TO A SCALE OF LOGARITHMICK TANGENTS OF HALF THE COMPLEMENTS OF THE LATITUDES THE DIFFICULTY TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF THIS PROPOSITION SEEMED SUCH TO MR MERCATOR THE AUTHOR OF LOGARITHMOTECHNIA THAT HE PROPOSED TO WAGER A GOOD SUM OF MONEY AGAINST WHOSO WOULD FAIRLY UNDER TAKE IT THAT HE SHOULD NOT DEMONSTRATE EITHER THAT IT WAS TRUE OR FALSE AND ABOUT THAT TIME MR JOHN COLLINS HOLDING A CORRESPONDENCE WITH ALL THE EMINENT MATHEMATICIANS OF THE AGE DID EXCITE THEM TO THIS ENQUIRY THE203 THE FIRST THAT DEMONSTRATED THE SAID ANALOGY WAS THE EX CELLENT MR JAMES GREGORY IN HIS EXERCITATIONES GEOMETRICAE PUBLISHED ANNO 1668 WHICH HE DID NOT WITHOUT A LONG TRAIN OF CONSEQUENCES AND COMPLICATION OF PROPORTIONS WHERE BY THE EVIDENCE OF THE DEMONSTRATION IS IN A GREAT MEASURE LOST AND THE READER WEARIED BEFORE HE ATTAIN IT NOR WITH LESS WORK AND APPARATUS HATH THE CELEBRATED DR BARROW IN HIS GEOMETRICAL LECTURES LECT XI APP I PROVED THAT THE SUM OF ALL THE SECANTS OF ANY ARCH IS ANALOGOUS TO THE LOGA RITHM OF THE RATIO OF RADIUS  SINE TO RAD  SINE ON WHICH IS ALL ONE THAT THE MERIDIONAL PARTS ANSWERING TO ANY DEGREE OF LATITUDE ARE AS THE LOGARITHMS OF THE RATIONES OF THE VER SED SINES OF THE DISTANCES FROM BOTH THE POLES SINCE WHICH THE INCOMPARABLE DR WALLIS ON OCCASION OF A PARALOGISM COMMITTED BY ONE MR NORRIS IN THIS MATTER HAS MORE FUL LY AND CLEARLY HANDLED THIS ARGUMENT AS MAY BE SEEN IN NUM 176 OF THESE TRANSACTIONS BUT NEITHER DR WALLIS NOR DR BARROW IN THEIR SAID TREATISES HAVE ANY WHERE TOUCH ED UPON THE AFORESAID RELATION OF THE MERIDIANLINE TO THE LOGARITHMICK TANGENT NOR HATH ANY ONE THAT I KNOW OF YET DISCOVERED THE RULE FOR COMPUTING INDEPENDENTLY THE INTER VAL OF THE MERIDIONAL PARTS ANSWERING TO ANY TWO GIVEN LA TITUDES WHEREFORE HAVING ATTAINED AS I CONCEIVE A VERY FACILE AND NATURAL DEMONSTRATION OF THE SAID ANALOGY AND HAVING FOUND OUT THE RULE FOR EXHIBITING THE DIFFERENCE OF MERIDIONAL PARTS BETWEEN ANY TWO PARALLELS OF LATITUDE WITHOUT FINDING BOTH THE NUMBERS WHEREOF THEY ARE THE DIFFERENCE I HOPE I MAY BE ENTITULED TO A SHARE IN THE EMPROVEMENTS OF THIS USE FUL PART OF GEOMETRY DESIRING NO OTHER FAVOUR OF SOME MATHEMATICAL PRETENDERS THAN THAT THEY THINK FIT TO BE SO JUST AS NEITHER TO ATTRIBUTE MY DESIRE TO PLEASE THE HONOU RABLE THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN THESE EXERCISESTO ANY KIND OF VANITY OR LOVE OF APPLAUSE IN ME WHO TOO WELL KNOW HOW VERY FEW THESE THINGS OBLIGE AND HOW SMALL REWARD THEY PROCURE NOR YET TO COMPLAIN CORAM NON JUDICE THAT I ARROGATE TO MY SELF THE INVENTIONS OF OTHERS AND UPON THAT PRETEXT TO DE PRETIATE WHAT I DO UNLESS AT THE SAME TIME THEY CAN PRO DUCE THE AUTHOR I WRONG TO PROVE THEIR ASSERTIONS SUCH DISINGENUITY AS I HAVE ALWAYS MOST CAREFULLY AVOIDED SO I WISH I HAD NOT TOO MUCH EXPERIENCE OF IT IN THE VERY SAME PERSONS204 PERSONS WHO MAKE IT THEIR BUSINESS TO DETRACT FROM THAT LITTLE SHARE OF REPUTATION I HAVE IN THESE THINGS BUT TO RETURN TO THE MATTER IN HAND LET US DEMONSTRATE THE FOLLOWING PROPOSITION THE MERIDIAN LINE IS A SCALE OF LOGARITHMICK TANGENTS OF THE HALF COMPLEMENTS OF THE LATITUDES FOR THIS DEMONSTRATION IT IS REQUISITE TO PREMISE THESE FOUR LEMMATA LEMMA I IN THE STEREOGRAPHICK PROJECTION OF THE SPHERE UPON THE PLAIN OF THE EQUINOCTIAL THE DISTANCES FROM THE CENTER WHICH IN THIS CASE IS THE POLE ARE LAID DOWN BY THE TAN GENTS OF HALF THOSE DISTANCES THAT IS OF HALF THE COMPLE MENTS OF THE LATITUDES THIS IS EVIDENT FROM EUCL 320 LEM II IN THE STEREOGRAPHICK PROJECTION THE ANGLES UNDER WHICH THE CIRCLES INTERFECT EACH OTHER ARE IN ALL CASES EQUAL TO THE SPHERICAL ANGLES THEY REPRESENT WHICH IS PERHAPS AS VALUABLE A PROPERTY OF THIS PROJECTION AS THAT OF ALL THE CIRCLES OF THE SPHERE THEREON APPEARING CIRCLES BUT THIS NOT BEING VULGARLY KNOWN MUST NOT BE ASSUMED WITHOUT A DEMONSTRA TION LET E B P L BE ANY GREAT CIRCLE OF THE SPHERE E THE EYE PLACED IN ITS CIRCUMFERENCE C ITS CENTER P ANY POINT THERE OF AND LET F C O BE SUPPOSED A PLAIN ERECTED AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE CIRCLE E B P LON WHICH F C O WE DESIGN THE SPHERE TO BE PROJECTED DRAW E P CROS SING THE PLAIN F C O IN P AND P SHALL BE THE POINT P PROJECTED TO THE POINT P DRAW THE TAN GENT A P G AND ON ANY POINT THEREOF AS A ERECT

SECTING D A K B L P D G F C O A P E205 SECTING THE PLAIN FCO IN THE POINTS A AND D AND JOYN A D P D I SAY THE TRIANGLE A D P IS SIMULAR TO THE TRIANGLE ADP AND THE ANGLE A P D EQUAL TO THE ANGLE APD DRAW PL AK PARALLEL TO FO AND BY REASON OF THE PARALLELS A P WILL BE TO A D AS AK TO AD BUT BY EUCL 3 32 IN THE TRIANGLE AKP THE ANGLE AKPLPE IS ALSO EQUAL TO APKEPG WHEREFORE THE SIDES AK AP ARE EQUAL AND ITWILL BE AS A P TO A D SO AP TO AD WHENCE THE ANGLES DAP D A P BEING RIGHT THE ANGLE APD WILL BE EQUAL TO THE ANGLE A P D THAT ISTHE SPHERICAL ANGLE IS EQUAL TO THAT ON THE PROJECTION AND THAT IN ALL CASES WHICH WAS TO BE PROVED THIS LEMMA I LATELY RECEIVED FROM MR AB DE MOIVRE THOUGH I SINCE UNDERSTAND FROM DR HOOK THAT HE LONG AGO PRODUCED THE SAME THING BEFORE THE SOCIETY HOWEVER THE DEMONSTRATION AND THE REST OF THE DISCOURSE IS MY OWN LEMMA III ON THE GLOBE THE RHUMB LINES MAKE EQUAL ANGLES WITH EVERY MERIDIAN AND BY THE AFOREGOING LEMMA THEY MUST LIKEWISE MAKE EQUAL ANGLES WITH THE MERIDIANS IN THE STEREOGRAPHICK PROJECTION ON THE PLAIN OF THE EQUATOR THEY ARE THEREFORE IN THAT PROJECTION PROPORTIONAL SPIRALS ABOUT THE POLE POINT LEMMA IV IN THE PROPORTIONAL SPIRAL IT IS A KNOWN PROPER TY THAT THE ANGLES BPC OR THE ARCHES BD ARE EXPONENTS OF THE RATIONES OF BP TO PC FOR IF THE ARCH BD BE DIVIDED INTO INNU MERABLE EQUAL PARTS RIGHT LINES DRAWN FROM THEM TO THE CENTER P SHALL DIVIDE THE CURVE BCCC INTO AN INFINITY OF PROPORTIONALS AND ALL THE LINES PC SHALL BE AN INFINITY OF PRO PORTIONALS BETWEEN PB AND PC WHOSE NUMBER IS EQUAL TO ALL THE POINTS DD IN THE ARCH BD WHENCE AND BY WHAT I HAVE DELIVERED IN NUM 216 IT FOLLOWS THAT AS BD TO BD OR AS THE ANGLE BPC TO THE ANGLE BPC SO IS THE LOGARITHM OF THE RATIO OF PB TO PC TO THE LOGARITHM OF THE RATIO OF PB TO PC P C D C C B D D I I FROM206 FROM THESE LEMMATA OUR PROPOSITION IS VERY CLEARLY DE MONSTRATED FOR BY THE FIRST PB PC PC ARE THE TANGENTS OF HALF THE COMPLEMENTS OF THE LATITUDES IN THE STEREOGRAPHICK PROJECTION AND BY THE LAST OF THEM THE DIFFERENCES OF LON GITUDE OR ANGLES AT THE POLE BETWEEN THEM ARE LOGARITHMS OF THE RATIONES OF THOSE TANGENTS ONE TO THE OTHER BUT THE NAUTICAL MERIDIAN LINE IS NO OTHER THAN A TABLE OF THE LON GITUDESANSWERING TO EACH MINUTE OF LATITUDEON THE RHUMB LINE MAKING AN ANGLE OF 45 DEGREES WITH THE MERIDIAN WHEREFORE THE MERIDIAN LINE IS NO OTHER THAN A SCALE OF LOGARITHMICK TANGENTS OF THE HALF COMPLEMENTS OF THE LA TITUDES QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM COROLL 1 BECAUSE THAT IN EVERY POINT OF ANY RHUMB LINE THE DIFFERENCE OF LATITUDE IS TO THE DEPARTURE AS THE RADIUS TO THE TANGENT OF THE ANGLE THAT RHUMB MAKES WITH THE ME RIDIAN AND THOSE EQUAL DEPARTURES ARE EVERY WHERE TO THE DIFFERENCES OF LONGITUDE AS THE RADIUS TO THE SECANT OF THE LATITUDE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE DIFFERENCES OF LONGITUDE ARE ON ANY RHUMB LOGARITHMS OF THE SAME TANGENTS BUT OF A DIFFERING SPECIES BEING PROPORTIONED TO ONE ANOTHER AS ARE THE TANGENTS OF THE ANGLES MADE WITH THE MERIDIAN COROLL 2 HENCE ANY SCALE OF LOGARITHM TANGENTS AS THOSE OF THE VULGAR TABLES MADE AFTER BRIGGS FORM OR THOSE MADE TO NAPIERS OR ANY OTHER FORM WHATSOEVER IS A TABLE OF THE DIFFERENCES OF LONGITUDE TO THE SEVERAL LATITUDES UP ON SOME DETERMINATE RHUMB OR OTHER AND THEREFORE AS THE TANGENT OF THE ANGLE OF SUCH RHUMB TO THE TANGENT OF ANY OTHER RHUMB SO THE DIFFERENCE OF THE LOGARITHMS OF ANY TWO TANGENTS TO THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE ON THE PROPOSED RHUMB INTERCEPTED BETWEEN THE TWO LATITUDES OF WHOSE HALF COMPLEMENTS YOU TOOK THE LOGARITHM TAN GENTS AND SINCE WE HAVE A VERY COMPLEAT TABLE OF LOGARITHM TANGENTS OF BRIGGS FORM PUBLISHED BY VLACQ ANNO 1633 IN HIS CANON MAGNUS TRIANGULORUM LEGARITHMICUS COMPUTED TO TEN DECIMAL PLACES OF THE LOGARITHM AND TO EVERY TEN SECONDS OF THE QUADRANT WHICH SEEMS TO BE MORE THAN SOFFICIENT FOR THE NICEST CALCULATOR I THOUGHT FIT TO ENQUIRE THE OB LIQUE ANGLE WITH WHICH THAT RHUMB LINE CROSSES THE MERI DIAN WHEREON THE SAID CANON OF VLACQ PRECISELY ANSWERS TO THE DIFFERENCES OF LONGITUDE PUTTING UNITY FOR ONE MINUTE THEREOF207 THEREOF AS IN THE COMMON MERIDIAN LINE NOW THE MO MENTARY AUGMENT OR FLUXION OF THE TANGENT LINE AT 45 DE GREES IS EXACTLY DOUBLE TO THE FLUXION OF THE ARCH OF THE CIR CLE AS MAY EASILY BE PROVED AND THE TANGENT OF 45 BE ING EQUAL TO RADIUS THE FLUXION ALSO OF THE LOGARITHM TAN GENT WILL BE DOUBLE TO THAT OF THE ARCH IF THE LOGARITHM BE OF NAPEIRS FORM BUT FOR BRIGGS FORM IT WILL BE AS THE SAME DOUBLED ARCH MULTIPLIED INTO 0 43429 C OR DIVIDED BY 2 30258 C YET THIS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY OF THE AD DITION OF AN INDIVISIBLE ARCH FOR IT CEASES TO BE TRUE IF THE ARCH HAVE ANY DETERMINATE MAGNITUDE HENCE IT APPEARS THAT IF ONE MINUTE BE SUPPOSED UNITY THE LENGTH OF THE ARCH OF ONE MINUTE BEING 000290888208665721596154 C IN PARTS OF THE RADIUS THE PROPORTION WILL BE AS UNITY TO 2908882 C SO RADI US TO THE TANGENT OF 71 1 42 WHOSE LOGARITHM IS 10 46372611720718325204 C AND UNDER THAT ANGLE IS THE MERIDIAN INTERSECTED BY THAT RUMB LINE ON WHICH THE DIFFERENCES OF NAPEIRS LOGARITHM TANGENTS OF THE HALF COMPLE MENTS OF THE LATITUDES ARE THE TRUE DIFFERENCES OF LONGITUDE ESTIMATED IN MINUTES AND PARTS TAKING THE FIRST FOUR FIGURES FOR INTEGERS BUT FOR VLACQS TABLES WE MUST SAY AS2302585 C TO 2908882 C SO RADIUS TO 126331143874244569212 C WHICH IS THE TANGENT OF 51 38 9 AND ITS LOGARITHM 10101510428507720941162 C WHEREFORE IN THE RHUMB LINE WHICH MAKES AN ANGLE OF 51 38 9 WITH THE MERIDIAN VLACQS LOGARITHM TAN GENTS ARE THE TRUE DIFFERENCES OF LONGITUDE AND THIS COM PARED WITH OUR SECOND COROLLARY MAY SUFFICE FOR THE USE OF THE TABLES ALREADY COMPUTED BUT IF A TABLE OF LOGARITHM TANGENTS BE MADE BY EX TRACTION OF THE ROOT OF THE INFINITETH POWER WHOSE INDEX IS THE LENGTH OF THE ARCH YOU PUT FOR UNITY AS FOR MINUTES THE0002908882TH C POWER WHICH WE WILL CALL A SUCH A SCALE OF TANGENTS SHALL BE THE TRUE MERIDIAN LINE OR SUM OF ALL THE SECANTS TAKEN INFINITELY MANY HERE THE READER IS DESIRED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO MY LITTLE TREATISE OF LOGARITHMS PUBLISHED IN N 216 P 58 THAT I MAY NOT NEED TO REPEAT IT BY WHAT IS THERE DELIVERED IT WILL FOLLOW THAT PUTTING T FOR THE EXCESS OR DEFECT OF ANY TANGENT ABOVE OR UNDER THE RADIUS OR TANGENT OF 45 THE LOGARITHM OF THE I I 2 RATIO208 RATIO OF RADIUS TO SUCH TANGENT WILL BE 1M INTO T  12TT  13TTT  14TTTT  15T C WHEN THE ARCH IS GREATER THAN 45GR OR 1M INTO T  12TT  13T3  T4  15T5 C WHEN IT IS LESS THAN 45G AND BY THE SAME DOCTRINE PUT TING T FOR THE TANGENT OF ANY ARCH AND T FOR THE DIFFERENCE THEREOF FROM THE TANGENT OF ANOTHER ARCH THE LOGARITHM OF THEIR RATIO WILL BE 1M INTO TT  TT2TT  T33T3  T44T4  T55T5 C WHEN T IS THE GREATER TERM OR 1M INTO TT  TT2TT  T33T3  T44T4  T55T5 C WHEN T IS THE LESSER TERM AND IF M BE SUPPOSED0002908882 C  A ITS RECI PROCAL RA WILL BE 34377467707849392526 C WHICH MUL TIPLIED INTO THE AFORESAID SERIES SHALL GIVE PRECISELY THE DIFFE RENCE OF MERIDIONAL PARTS BETWEEN THE TWO LATITUDES TO WHOSE HALF COMPLEMENTS THE ASSUMED TANGENTS BELONG NOR IS IT MATERIAL FROM WHETHER POLE YOU ESTIMATE THE COM PLEMENTS WHETHER THE ELEVATED OR DEPRESSED THE TANGENTS BEING TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE SAME RATIO AS THEIR COMPLE MENTS BUT INVERTED IN THE SAME DISCOURSE I ALSO SHEWED THAT THE SERIES MIGHT BE MADE TO CONVERGE TWICE AS SWIFT ALL THE EVEN POWERS BEING OMITTED AND THAT PUTTING  FOR THE SUM OF THE TWO TAN GENTS THE SAME LOGARITHM WOULD BE 2M OR 2RA INTO T  T333  T555  T777  T999 C BUT THE RATIO OF  TO T OR OF THE SUM OF TWO TANGENTS TO THEIR DIFFERENCE IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE SINE OF THE SUM OF THE ARCHES TO THE SINE OF THEIR DIFFERENCE WHEREFORE IF S BE PUT FOR THE SINE COMPLEMENT OF THE MIDDLE LATITUDE AND S FOR THE SINE OF HALF THE DIFFERENCE OF LATITUDES THE SAME SERIES WILL BE 2R209 2 RA INTO SS  S 33S3  S 55S5  S 77S7  S 99S9 C WHEREIN AS THE DIFFERENCES OF LATITUDE ARE SMALLER FEWER STEPS WILL SUFFICE AND IF THE EQUATOR BE PUT FOR THE MIDDLE LA TITUDE AND CONSEQUENTLY S  R AND S TO THE SINE OF THE LATI TUDETHE MERIDIONAL PARTS RECKONED FROM THE EQUATOR WILL BE SA  S 33RRA  S 55R4A  S 77R6A C WHICH IS COINCIDENT WITH DR WALLISS SOLUTION IN NUMB 176 AND THIS SAME SERIES BEING HALF THE LOGARITHM OF THE RATIO OF R  S TO R  S THAT IS OF THE VERSEDSINES OF THE DISTANCES FROM BOTH POLES DOES AGREE WITH WHAT DR BARROW HAD SHEWN IN HIS XI LECTURE THE SAME RATIO OF T TO T MAY BE EXPRESSED ALSO BY THAT OF THE SUM OF THE COSINES OF THE TWO LATITUDES TO THE SINE OF THEIR DIFFERENCE AS LIKEWISE BY THAT OF THE SINE OF THE SUM OF THE TWO LATITUDES TO THE DIFFERENCE OF THEIR CO SINES OR BY THAT OF THE VERSEDSINE OF THE SUM OF THE COLATITUDES TO THE DIFFERENCE OF THE SINES OF THE LATITUDES OR AS THE SAME DIFFERENCE OF THE SINES OF THE LATITUDESTO THE VERSEDSINE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE LATITUDES ALL WHICH ARE IN THE SAME RATIO OF THE COSINE OF THE MIDDLE LATITUDE TO THE SINE OF HALF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE LATITUDES AS IT WERE EASIE TO DEMONSTRATE IF THE READER WERE NOT SUPPOSED CAPABLE TO DO IT HIMSELF UPON A BARE INSPECTION OF A SHEME DULY REPRESENTING THESE LINES THIS VARIETY OF EXPRESSION OF THE SAME RATIO I THOUGHT NOT FIT TO BE OMITTED BECAUSE BY HELP OF THE RATIONALITY OF THE SINE OF 30GR IN ALL CASES WHERE THE SUM OR DIFFERENCE OF THE LATITUDES IS 30GR 60GR 90GR 120GR OR 150 DEGREES SOME ONE OF THEM WILL EXHIBIT A SIMPLE SERIES WHEREIN GREAT PART OF THE LABOUR WILL BE SAVED AND BESIDES I AM WILLING TO GIVE THE READER HIS CHOICE WHICH OF THESE EQUIPOLLENT ME THODS TO MAKE USE OF BUT FOR HIS EXERCISE SHALL LEAVE THE PRO SECUTION OF THEM AND THE COMPENDIA ARISING THEREFROM TO HIS OWN INDUSTRY CONTENTING MY SELF TO CONSIDER ONLY THE FORMER WHICH FOR ALL USES SEEMS THE MOST CONVENIENT WHE THER WE DESIGN TO MAKE THE WHOLE MERIDIAN LINE OR ANY PART THEREOF VIZ 2R210 2 RA INTO SS  S 33S3  S 55S5  S 77S7  S 99S9 C WHEREIN A IS THE LENGTH OF ANY ARCH WHICH YOU DESIGN SHALL BE THE INTEGER OR UNITY IN YOUR MERIDIONAL PARTS WHETHER IT BE A MINUTE LEAGUE OR DEGREE OR ANY OTHER S THE CO SINE OF THE MIDDLE LATITUDE AND S THE SINE OF HALF THE DIFFE RENCE OF LATITUDES BUT THE SECANTS BEING THE RECIPROCALS OF THE CO SINES SS WILL BE EQUAL TO SSRR PUTTING S FOR THE SE CANT OF THE MIDDLE LATITUDE AND 2RA INTO SS WILL BE  2SSAR THIS MULTIPLIED BY S S2SS THAT IS BY SSSS3RRRR WILL GIVE THE SE COND STEP AND THAT AGAIN BY 3 SSSS5RRRR THE THIRD STEP AND SO FORWARD TILL YOU HAVE COMPLEATED AS MANY PLACES AS YOU DESIRE BUT THE SQUARES OF THE SINES BEING IN THE SAME RATIO WITH THE VERSED SINES OF THE DOUBLE ARCHES WE MAY INSTEAD OF S S3SS ASSUME FOR OUR MULTIPLICATOR V3 V OR THE VERSED SINE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE LATITUDES DIVIDED BY THRICE THE VERSEDSINE OF THE SUM OF THE COLATITUDES C WHICH IS THE UTMOST COMPENDIUM I CAN THINK OF FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THE SAME SERIES WILL BECOME 2 S RA S INTO 1  V3 V  V25 V2  V37 V3  V49 V4 HEREBY WE ARE ENABLED TO ESTIMATE THE DEFAULT OF THE ME THOD OF MAKING THE MERIDIAN LINE BY THE CONTINUAL ADDITI ON OF THE SECANTS OF AEQUIDIFFERENT ARCHS WHICH AS THE DIF FERENCES OF THOSE ARCHES ARE SMALLER DOES STILL NEARER AND NEARER APPROACH THE TRUTH IF WE ASSUME AS MR WRIGHT DID THE ARCH OF ONE MINUTE TO BE UNITY AND ONE MINUTE TO BE THE COMMON DIFFERENCE OF A RANK OF ARCHES IT WILL BE IN ALL CASES AS THE ARCH OF ONE MINUTE TO ITS CHORD SO THE SECANT OF THE MIDDLE LATITUDE TO THE FIRST STEP OF OUR SERIES THIS BY REASON OF THE NEAR EQUALITY BETWEEN A AND 2 S WHICH ARE TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE RATIO OF UNITY TO 1000000000352566457713 C WILL NOT DIFFER FROM THE SECANT211 SECANT S BUT IN THE NINTH FIGURE BEING LESS THAN IT IN THAT PROPORTION THE NEXT STEP BEING  2 S 3 S 33 A R WILL BE EQUAL TO THE CUBE OF THE SECANT OF THE MIDDLE LATITUDE MULTIPLIED INTO 2 S S S3ARR 000000000705132908715 WHICH THEREFORE UNLESS THE SECANT EXCEED TEN TIMES RADIUS CAN NEVER AMOUNT TO 1 IN THE FIFTH PLACE THESE TWO STEPS SUFFICE TO MAKE THE ME RIDIAN LINE OR LOGARITHM TANGENT TO FAR MORE PLACES THAN ANY TABLES OF NATURAL SECANTS YET EXTANT ARE COMPUTED TO BUT IF THE THIRD STEP BE REQUIRED IT WILL BE FOUND TO BE  SS INTO 2 S 5 AR4  0000000000000000089498 BY ALL WHICH IT APPEARS THAT MR WRIGHTS TABLE DOES NO WHERE EX CEED THE TRUE MERIDIAN PARTS BY FULLY HALF A MINUTE WHICH SMALL DIFFERENCE ARISES BY HIS HAVING ADDED CONTINU ALLY THE SECANTS OF 123 C INSTEAD OF 012112212 312 C BUT AS IT IS IT IS ABUNDANTLY SUFFICIENT FOR NAUTICAL USES THAT IN SR JONAS MOORS NEW SYSTEME OF THE MATHEMATICKS IS MUCH NEARER THE TRUTH BUT THE DIFFERENCE FROM  IS SCARCE SENSIBLE TILL YOU EXCEED THOSE LATITUDES WHERE NAVIGATION CEASES TO BE PRACTICABLE THE ONE EXCEEDING THE TRUTH BY ABOUT HALF A MINUTE THE OTHER BEING A VERY SMALL MATTER DEFICIENT THEREFROM FOR AN EXAMPLE EASIE TO BE IMITATED BY WHOFO PLEASES I HAVE ADDED THE TRUE MERIDIONAL PARTS TO THE FIRST AND LAST MINUTES OF THE QUADRANT NOT SO MUCH THAT THERE IS ANY OCCASION FOR SUCH ACCURACY AS TO SHEW THAT I HAVE OBTAINED AND LAID DOWN HEREIN THE FULL DOCTRINE OF THESE SPIRAL RHUMBS WHICH ARE OF SO GREAT CONCERN IN THE ART OF NAVIGATION THE FIRST MINUTE IS 100000001410265862178 THE SECOND 200000005641063806707 THE LASTOR 8959 IS 303749634311414228643 AND NOT 323485279 AS MR WRIGHT HAS IT BY THE ADDITION OF THE SECANTS OF EVERY WHOLE MINUTE NOR 302498 AS MR OUGHTREDS RULE MAKES IT BY ADDING THE SECANTS OF EVERY OTHER HALF MINUTE NOR 303643 AS SIR JONAS MOOR HAD CON CLUDED IT BY I KNOW NOT WHAT METHOD THO IN THE REST OF HIS TABLE HE FOLLOW OUGHTRED AND212 AND THIS MAY SUFFICE TO SHEW HOW TO DERIVE THE TRUE ME RIDIAN LINE FROM THE SINES TANGENTS OR SECANTS SUPPOSED READY MADE BUT WE ARE NOT DESTITUTE OF A METHOD FOR DE DUCING THE SAME INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE ARCH IT SELF IF THE LATITUDE FROM THE EQUATOR BE ESTIMATED BY THE LENGTH OF ITS ARCH A RADIUS BEING UNITY AND THE ARCH PUT FOR AN INTEGER BE A AS BEFORE THE MERIDIONAL PARTS ANSWERING TO THAT LATITUDE WILL BE 1AINTO A16 A3124 A318460 A OR 615040 A71128801386 A9 OR 1385362880 A9C WHICH CONVERGES MUCH SWIFTER THAN ANY OF THE FORMER SERIES AND BESIDES HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF AENCREASING IN ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION WHICH WOULD BE OF GREAT EASE IF ANY SHOULD UN DERTAKE DE NOVO TO MAKE THE LOGARITHM TANGENTS OR THE ME RIDIAN LINE TO MANY MORE PLACES THAN NOW WE HAVE THEM THE LOGARITHM TANGENT TO THE ARCH OF 45  12 A BEING NO OTHER THAN THE AFORESAID SERIES A  16 A3  124 A C IN NAPEIRS FORM OR THE SAME MULTIPLIED INTO 043429 C FOR BRIGGSS BUT BECAUSE ALL THESE SERIES TOWARDS THE LATTER END OF THE QUADRANT DO CONVERGE EXCEEDING SLOWLY SO AS TO RENDER THIS METHOD ALMOST USELESS OR AT LEAST VERY TEDIOUS IT WILL BE CONVENIENT TO APPLY SOME OTHER ARTS BY ASSUMING THE SECANTS OF SOME INTERMEDIATE LATITUDES AND YOU MAY FOR S OR THE SINE OF  THE ARCH OF HALF THE DIFFERENCE OF LATI TUDES SUBSTITUTE   16 3  1120 5  15040 7  1362880 9 C ACCORDING TO MR NEWTONS RULE FOR GIVING THE SINE FROM THE ARCH AND IF  BE NO MORE THAN A DEGREE A VERY FEW STEPS WILL SUFFICE FOR ALL THE ACCURACY THAT CAN BE DESIRED AND IF  BE COMMENSURABLE TO A THAT IS IF IT BE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THOSE ARCHES WHICH YOU MAKE YOUR INTEGER THEN WILL A BE THAT NUMBER WHICH IF WE CALL N THE PARTS OF THE MERIDIONAL LINE WILL BE FOUND TO BE SNR213 1  SS3R4  S445R8  S667R12C  6RR  SS 46R6  S4 66 R20C SNR INTO  1120 4R4  13 S2 6360 R8 C  1 65040 R6 C IN THIS THE FIRST TWO STEPS ARE GENERALLY SUFFICIENT FOR NAU TICAL USES ESPECIALLY WHEN NEITHER OF THE LATITUDES EXCEED 60 DEGREES AND THE DIFFERENCE OF LATITUDES DOTH NOT PASS 30 DEGREES BUT I AM SENSIBLE I HAVE ALREADY SAID TOO MUCH FOR THE LEARNED THO TOO LITTLE FOR THE LEARNER TO SUCH I CAN RE COMMEND NO BETTER TREATISE THAN THAT OF DR WALLIS IN NUMB 176 WHEREIN HE HAS WITH HIS USUAL BREVITY AND THAT PERSPECUITY PECULIAR TO HIMSELF HANDLED THIS SUBJECT FROM THE FIRST PRINCIPLES WHICH HERE FOR THE MOST PART WE SUP POSE KNOWN I NEED NOT SHEW HOW BY REGRESSIVE WORK TO FIND THE LA TITUDES FROM THE MERIDIONAL PARTS THE METHOD BEING SUFFI CIENTLY OBVIOUS I SHALL ONLY CONCLUDE WITH THE PROPOSAL OF A PROBLEM WHICH REMAINS TO MAKE THIS DOCTRINE COMPLEAT AND THAT IS THIS A SHIP SAILS FROM A GIVEN LATITUDE AND HAVING RUN A CER TAIN NUMBER OF LEAGUES HAS ALTERED HER LONGITUDE BY A GI VEN ANGLE IT IS REQUIRED TO FIND THE COURSE SHE STEARED THE SOLUTION HEREOF WOULD BE VERY ACCEPTABLE IF NOT TO THE PUBLICK AT LEAST TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS TRACT BEING LIKELY TO OPEN SOME FURTHER LIGHT INTO THE MYSTERIES OF GEOMETRY TO CONCLUDE I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT UNITY BEING RADIUS THE COSINE OF THE ARCH A ACCORDING TO THE SAME RULES OF MR NEWTON WILL BE 1  12 A2  124 A4  1720 A  140320 A8  13628800 A10 C FROM WHICH AND THE FORMER SERIES EXHIBITING THE SINE BY THE ARCH BY DIVISION IT IS EASIE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE NATURAL TANGENT TO THE ARCH A IS K K A214 A  13 A3  215 A5  17315 A7  622835 A9 C AND THE NATURAL SECANT TO THE SAME ARCH 1  12 A2  524 A4  1726 A6  2778064 A8 C AND FROM THE ARITHMETICK OF INFINITES THE NUMBER OF THESE SECANTS BEING THE ARCH A IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THE INFINITE SECANTS ON THAT ARCH IS A  16 A3  124 A5  685040 A7  27772576 A9 C THE WHICH BY WHAT FOREGOES IS THE LOGARITHM TANGENT OF NAPEIRS FORM FOR THE ARCH OF 45GR  12 A AS BEFORE AND COLLECTING THE INFINITE SUM OF ALL THE NATURAL TAN GENTS ON THE SAID ARCH A THERE WILLARISE 12 A A  112 A4  145 A6  172520 A8  3124175 A10 C TWHICH WILL BE FOUND TO BE THE LOGARITHM OF THE SECANT OF HE SAME ARCH A

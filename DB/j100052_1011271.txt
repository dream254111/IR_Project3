J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011271,THE COLUMBIA PARK BOYS CLUB A UNIQUE PLAYGROUND,I242604,THE COLUMBIA PARK BOYS CLUB A UNIQUE PLAYGROUND BY EUSTACE M PEIXOTTO SAN FRANCISCO CAL MANY PERSONS IN THE COUNTRY TODAY ARE COMING TO REALIZE THAT A BOYS PLAY FAR FROM BEING A NEGLIGIBLE QUANTITY IS WELL NIGH AS IMPORTANT A FACTOR IN HIS LIFE AS HIS SCHOOLING IN SCHOOL A BOY LEARNS THE FACTS THAT FIT HIM TO TAKE HIS PLACE IN THE WORLD BUT IT IS LARGELY IN HIS RELATIONS WITH HIS PLAYFELLOWS THAT HIS CHAR ACTER IS FORMED A BOY IS KNOWN BY THE COMPANY HE KEEPS AND IS LARGELY FORMED BY IT IT WAS WITH THIS IDEA IN MIND THAT SIDNEY S PEIXOTTO STARTED HIS BOYS CLUB WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE FRUITION OF WHICH IS THE COLUMBIA PARK BOYS CLUB WHICH IS TODAY PERHAPS THE MOST UNIQUE AND HIGHLY DEVELOPED INSTITUTION OF ITS KIND IN THE UNITED STATES INSTEAD OF GOING AT THE PROBLEM OF THE CITY BOY AND HIS SPARE HOURS WITH THE IDEA OF WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE BOY AND WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO THE QUESTION IN THE COLUMBIA PARK BOYS CLUB HAS BEEN FIRST WHAT DOES THE CITY BOY WANT WHAT APPEALS TO HIM IN OTHER WORDS THE CLUB AIMS TO GIVE HEALTHFUL PLAY OF THE KIND BOYS REALLY LIKE NOT THE KIND THAT PEOPLE THINK THEY OUGHT TO LIKE BUT THIS PLAY IS SO MOLDED THAT ITS RESULTS ARE A VITAL CHARACTER BUILDING FORCE IN A BOYS LIFE THAT THE CLUB APPEALS TO BOYS IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT WHILE MANY BOYS CLUBS ARE SEEKING MEMBERS THIS CLUB HAS ITS MEMBER SHIP LIMITED TO THE NUMBER THAT THE WORKERS CAN PROPERLY HANDLE THERE IS ALSO A LARGE WAITING LIST TAKEN CARE OF BY PUTTING THOSE WISHING TO JOIN IN A RECRUIT GYMNASIUM CLASS TO WAIT UNTIL THERE IS A VACANCY IN THE CLUB OTHER THAN THIS LIMITATION OF NUMBERS THERE IS NO RESTRICTION AS TO ADMISSION TO THE CLUB BOYS OF ANY NATIONALITY OR CREED ARE AT LIBERTY TO JOIN ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT ADMITTED EXCEPT IN UNU SUAL CASES OVER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN OR UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHT NO DUES ARE CHARGED BY THE CLUB THE BOYS ARE EXPECTED TO LOOK UPON IT AS THEY DO THEIR SCHOOL TO REPAY WHAT IT GIVES THEM 436THE COLUMBIA PARK BOYS CLUB IN THE SAME WAY THAT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO REPAY THE STATE FOR WHAT IT GIVES THEM IN THE WAY OF EDUCATION BY LOYALTY AND GOOD CITI ZENSHIP OR TRANSLATED IN THE TERMS OF THE CLUB TO HAVE THE RIGHT CLUB SPIRIT AND TO BE A GOOD CLUB MEMBER WITH ALL THAT THAT IS TAKEN TO MEAN INCLUDING LIVING UP TO A HIGH STANDARD OF BEHAVIOR A GOOD CLUB MEMBER MUST ATTEND CLUB REGULARLY THREE TIMES A WEEK ONCE FOR HIS CLUB NIGHT ONCE FOR GYMNASIUM AND ONCE FOR MILITARY DRILL OR BAND PRACTICE THE LATTER TWO TERMS MUST BE SELFEXPLANATORY HERE ALTHOUGH MUCH COULD BE SAID ABOUT THE WORK OF THE CLUB ALONG BOTH OF THESE LINES IT HAS REACHED A HIGH STATE OF PERFECTION THE WORDS CLUB NIGHT HARDLY CONVEY AN ADEQUATE IDEA TO THE UNINITIATED THE BOYS OF THE CLUB ARE DIVIDED INTO GROUPS OF TWENTYFIVE EACH AND THUS FORMED INTO CLUBS EACH MEETING ONE NIGHT A WEEK AND HAVING ITS OWN OFFICERS THESE ORGANIZATIONS LAST ONLY FOR A YEAR WHEN THE MEMBERS ARE REDIS TRIBUTED THIS SAVES CLIQUES THE CLUBS CARRY ON A TOURNAMENT IN ALL VARIETIES OF SPORT BASEBALL BASKETBALL TRACK ATHLETICS GYM NASIUM COMPETITION AND SO ON THE BOYS COME TO GYMNASIUM IN THE SAME GROUP AS TO THEIR CLUB NIGHT THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE THE GROUP THAT COMES TUESDAY TO CLUB COMES WEDNESDAY TO GYMNA SIUM ON THE CLUB NIGHT PROPER THREE ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED ON FIRST COMES THE PARLIAMENTARY MEETING THEN AN HOURS MANUAL TRAINING WORK AND THEN AN IMPROMPTU ACT THE PLOT OF WHICH IS MADE UP BEFOREHAND BUT THE DIALOGUE OF WHICH DEVELOPS AS THE PLAY PROGRESSES THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN DIVISIONS OF THE CLUBCLUBNIGHT GYMNASIUM AND DRILLBUT IN ADDITION TO THESE TWO BANDS A DRUM CORPS AND A CHORUS ARE MAINTAINED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IS DEVOTED TO ATHLETICS THE OUTGROWTH OF THE CLUBS ATHLETIC WORK BEING THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ATHLETIC LEAGUE OF SAN FRANCISCO THROUGH WHICH IT HAS BEEN THE PRIME FACTOR IN INTRODUCING SANELY REGULATED ATHLETICS INTO THE SCHOOLS OF THE CITY THIS ORGANIZATION HAS ITS HEADQUARTERS AT THE CLUB AND THE BULK OF THE ACTUAL WORK IS DONE BY PERSONS ALSO CONNECTED WITH THE CLUB IT MAY BE SAID HERE IN PASSING THAT THE CLUB HAS DEVELOPED MORE AND MORE INTO A SCHOOLBOYS CLUB AN ADJUNCT TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THE EFFORT HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY MADE TO KEEP BOYS AT SCHOOL AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO GOOD WORK IN SCHOOL THE WHOLE PLAN OF THE CLUB IS SUCH THAT A SCHOOL BOY 437 221THE ALNNALS OF THE AM4ERICAN ACADEMY FINDS IT EASY TO BE A REGULAR MEMBER WHILE A BOY THAT GOES TO WORK MISSES MANY OF ITS ADVANTAGES THE ABOVE IS A BRIEF RESUME OF THE COLUMBIA PARK BOYS CLUB DURING THE MAJOR PART OF THE YEAR IN ITS SAN FRANCISCO HOME BUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PHASES OF THE WORK IS CROWDED INTO THE SEVEN WEEKS SUMMER VACATION WHEN CAMPS ARE IN ORDER THE SUMMER WALKING TRIPS OF THE CLUB HAVE BECOME FAMOUS AS A UNIQUE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INSTITUTION THESE TRIPS WERE STARTED SOME YEARS AGO BY MAJOR PEIXOTTO WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR THOUGHT AS TO WHAT THEY WOULD DEVELOP INTO MR PEIXOTTO WAS A GREAT LOVER OF TRAMPING HIMSELF AND EVERY SUMMER USED TO TAKE A WALK ING TRIP INTO THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS IN THE REGION OF YO SEMITE VALLEY ONE YEAR HE INVITED TWO OF THE CLUB BOYS TO ACCOM PANY HIM THE EXPERIMENT PLEASED HIM SO WELL THAT THE NEXT YEAR HE TOOK FIVE OF THEM ON A SHORT WALK FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO MONTEREY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES THE NEXT YEAR HE INCREASED THE NUMBER TO TWELVE AND THE WALK WAS TO YOSEMITE VALLEY DURING THIS YEAR THE CHORUS OF THE CLUB HAD BEEN DEVELOPED TO A HIGH STATE OF PERFECTION AND MOST OF THE BEST SINGERS HAPPENED TO BE ON THIS TRIP WHEN THEY WERE IN YOSEMITE VALLEY IT WAS SUG GESTED THAT THE BOYS GIVE A CONCERT IN THE CHAPEL WHICH WAS ACCORD INGLY DONE THIS GAVE MR PEIXOTTO THE IDEA THAT IF HE COULD WORK UP THIS FEATURE OF GIVING A CONCERT OR OTHER PERFORMANCE PROPERLY HE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME MONEY WHICH WOULD PAY THE EXPENSES OF SUCH A TRIP AND WOULD ENABLE HIM TO TAKE AWAY A LARGER NUMBER OF BOYS ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE NEXT SUMMER CAME EIGHTEEN BOYS WERE INCLUDED IN THE PARTY AND A REGULAR VAUDEVILLE ENTERTAINMENT WAS PLANNED THE OBJECTIVE POINT OF THE TOUR WAS EUREKA SOME FOUR HUNDRED MILES NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO AND IN THE LUMBER CAMPS OF MENDOCINO COUNTY AND THE TOWNS ALONG THE ROUTE THE BOYS MADE A BIG SUCCESS OF THE ATTEMPT THE NEXT YEAR THE TRIP WAS TO LOS ANGELES FIVE HUNDRED MILES TO THE SOUTH AND SINCE THAT TIME THE TOUR HAS ALTERNATED BETWEEN THESE TWO POINTS WITH A CONSTANTLY INCREASING NUMBER OF BOYS REACHING FIFTYFIVE IN I908 DURING THE PAST YEAR MR PEIXOTTO ENCOURAGED BY HIS SUCCESS AT HOME TOOK A GROUP OF FORTY BOYS WHICH HAD BEEN ON TRIPS BEFORE ON AN EXTENDED TOUR OF AUSTRALIA WHICH LASTED FROM MAY IO99 TO FEBRUARY I9I0 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO MORE THAN TO 438 222THE COLUMBIA PARK BOYS CLUB MENTION HERE THIS REMARKABLE UNDERTAKING WHICH HE HAS CARRIED THROUGH WITH GREAT SUCCESS IN THE MEANTIME HOWEVER ANOTHER GROUP OF BOYS WAS TAKEN ON THE REGULAR WALKING TRIP TO LOS ANGELES AND ALONG EVERY LINE OF ENDEAVOR MADE FULLY AS MUCH OF A SUCCESS OF IT AS THOSE IN FORMER YEARS SHOWING THAT SUCH A TRIP IS ENTIRELY FEASIBLE TO ANY GROUP OF BOYS PROPERLY CONDUCTED THESE SUMMER WALKING TRIPS ARE GREAT BUILDERS OF BONE AND TISSUE AFTER A BOY HAS WALKED FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED MILES SLEPT IN THE OPEN AIR AND EATEN PLAIN WHOLESOME AND ABUNDANT FOOD FOR SEVEN WEEKS HE IS IN THE PINK OF PHYSICAL CONDITION IT IS A TREAT TO SEE THE LADS OF ONE OF THESE PARTIES WHEN THEY RETURN TO THE CITY AFTER THEIR VACATION RUDDY AND TANNED WITH LEGS AS HARD AS IRON THEY COME BACK GLOWING WITH MEMORIES OF HAPPY DAYS AND READY PHY SICALLY AND MENTALLY FOR A YEAR OF EARNEST WORK IN SCHOOL THE TRIPS ARE HARD IN SOME WAYS ON ACCOUNT OF THE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCES THE TOUR MUST BE MADE ACCORDING TO A SCHEDULE LAID OUT BEFOREHAND AND THE PARTY MUST NEVER BE BEHIND TIME THEY MUST MAKE THE TOWN THEY ARE DUE TO SHOW IN BE THE DISTANCE FOUR OR TWENTYEIGHT MILES THE WALKS VARIED BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES LAST SUMMER THE AVERAGE BEING FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILES A DAY AND THEN THEY MUST PARADE ON THE MAIN STREET EACH BOY OF THE PARTY PLAYING SOME MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THEN GIVE A HIGHCLASS ENTER TAINMENT THAT HAS TO BE KEPT UP TO THE SCRATCH THEN TO BED IN THE SLEEP ING BAGS AND UP EARLY THE NEXT MORNING TO AVOID THE HEAT ON THE DAYS WALK OF COURSE THE TRIP IS PLANNED SO THAT OCCASIONAL RESTS OF A DAY OR SO ARE TAKEN IN THE LARGER TOWNS ON THE MARCH THE BOYS ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE THEIR NATURAL PACE ONLY BEING REQUIRED TO KEEP BETWEEN A LEADING AND A TRAILING PARTY WHICH ARE OFTEN TWO MILES APART THE PARAPHERNALIA OF THE PARTY INCLUDING SLEEPING BAGS NO TENTS ARE USED SUMMER IN CALI FORNIA BEING RAINLESS A COMPLETE SET OF COSTUMES FOR THE PERFORM ANCE BAND INSTRUMENTS AND COOKING EQUIPMENT IS CARRIED ON TWO WAGONS TO GET THIS ALL IN SUCH A SMALL COMPASS REQUIRES SOME SCIENTIFIC PACKING BUT IT CAN BE DONE WITH A LITTLE PLANNING FOOD IS BOUGHT AS NEEDED IN THE TOWNS ALONG THE ROUTE THE BOYS DO ALL THEIR OWN COOKING AND OTHER CAMP WORK THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF THESE TRIPS CAN HARDLY BE OVERESTI MATED FOR EXAMPLE ON THE LAST SUMMER WALKING TRIP TO LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO THE BOYS COVERED 1500 MILES 440 ON FOOT 439 223THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND THE REST BY RAILROAD THEY SAW EVERY CITY AND TOWN OF IMPORTANCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VISITED NEARLY EVERY ONE OF CALI FORNIAS HISTORIC MISSIONS AND GOT AN IDEA OF THE CHARACTER AND PRODUCTS OF THE COUNTRY THEY PASSED THROUGH SUCH AS CANNOT BE ACQUIRED FROM CAR WINDOWS AND ONE THAT WILL MAKE AN IMPRESSION THAT YEARS OF STUDY WOULD HARDLY GIVE BESIDES THE WALKING PARTY THE CLUB HAS MAINTAINED EACH YEAR FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS A STATIONARY CAMP THIS IS A JUNIOR REPUBLIC WITH A GOVERNMENT WORKED OUT LARGELY ALONG ORIGINAL LINES TO SUIT THE NEEDS OF THE CAMP RATHER THAN IN IMITATION OF ANY FORM OF ACTUAL GOVERNMENT AT THIS CAMP AS ON THE WALKING TRIPS THE BOYS DO ALL THE CAMP WORK AND THIS DONE SWIM TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT PLAY BASEBALL AND OTHER GAMES AND GET UP ENTERTAINMENTS TO GIVE AROUND THE CAMP FIRE IN THE EVENING THIS SUMMER WORK HAS BECOME AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CLUB THE BOYS LOOK FORWARD TO IT WITH THE GREATEST ANTICIPA TION THEY TALK ABOUT LAST SUMMERS CAMP UNTIL CHRISTMAS AND THEN THEY BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THE NEXT YEAR WITH THE THREE TRIPS OF THE PAST YEAR ONE OF FORTYTHREE TO AUSTRALIA ONE OF FORTYFOUR TO LOS ANGELES AND ONE OF SIXTY TO THE STATIONARY CAMP AT CLOVERDALE NEARLY EVERY MEMBER THAT HAS BEEN IN CLUB ANY LENGTH OF TIME WAS TAKEN AWAY DURING THE SUMMER SIX WEEKS DAY AND NIGHT WITH A BOY MEANS KNOWING HIM AS YOU CAN NEVER KNOW HIM IN SIX YEARS OF ORDINARY CLUB WORK AND IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS FACTOR IN THE SUCCESS OF THE CLUB AS AN ORGANIZATION FOR BOYS 440 224

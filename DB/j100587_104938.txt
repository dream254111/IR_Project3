J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,104938,A LETTER TO GEORGE LEWIS SCOT ESQ F R S CONCERNING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND FROM THE REVEREND WILLIAM BRAKENRIDGE D D RECTOR OF ST MICHAEL BASSISHAW LONDON AND F R S,I206914,A LETTER TO GEORGE LEWIS SCOT ESQ F R S CONCERNING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND FROM THE REVEREND WILLIAM BRAKENRIDGE D D RECTOR OF ST MICHAEL BASSISHAW LONDON AND F R S DEAR SIR HAVING LATELY WROTE TO YOU MY OB SERVATIONS CONCERNING THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS IN LONDON AND WESTMINSTER THIS HAS LED ME ALSO TO CONSIDER WHETHER THERE MAY NOT BE SOME WAY TO COMPUTE NEARLY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND IF IT CAN BE DONE THERE ARE MANY POLITICAL USES THAT MAY BE MADE OF IT AND MANY CONCLUSIONS THAT MAY BE DRAWN WHICH MAY PREVENT MISTAKES IN GOVERNMENT AND THAT WILL TEND TO PROMOTE THE STRENGTH AND RICHES OF THE NATION THE SUBJECT IS INDEED INTRICATE AND THERE CANNOT BE THAT READ NOV 20 1755269 THAT ACCURACY IN SUCH CALCULATIONS AS MIGHT BE DE SIRED BUT I IMAGINE WE MAY COME SO NEAR THE TRUTH AS IS SUFFICIENT FOR ANY PURPOSE TO REASON UPON OR TO BE A FOUNDATION FOR ANY SPECULATIONS IN POLICY AS YOU ARE A GOOD JUDGE OF SUCH COMPUTATIONS I PRE SUME TO SEND YOU WHAT I HAVE DONE AND IF I HAVE YOUR APPROBATION I SHALL BE MORE SATISFIED THAT I AM IN THE RIGHT BUT IF I BE MISTAKEN IN ANY PARTICU LARS YOU WILL I HOPE MAKE GREAT ALLOWANCE FOR THE FAILURE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE DIFFICULTIES THAT OC CUR THERE SEEMS TO ME TO BE ONLY TWO WAYS OF DISCO VERING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND WHERE AT PRESENT THERE ARE NO CAPITATION TAXES EITHER BY THE NUMBER OF HOUSES OR THE QUANTITY OF BREAD CON SUMED I SHALL CONSIDER BOTH THESE METHODS OF COM PUTING SO FAR AS THINGS ARE KNOWN TO ME AND THE RESULT FROM EACH OF THEM BEING COMPARED TOGETHER THEY WILL CORRECT ONE ANOTHER FROM WHICH AT LEAST THE LIMITS OF THE NUMBER MAY BE NEARLY FOUND AS TO THE FIRST IT IS EVIDENT THAT IF THE NUMBER OF HOUSES COULD BE DETERMINED IT WOULD THEN BE VERY EASY TO COMPUTE NEARLY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FOR IT MIGHT BE EASILY KNOWN BY TRIAL WHAT NUMBER AT AN AVERAGE COULD BE ALLOWED TO EACH HOUSE AND FROM THENCE THE WHOLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DEDUCED IN MY LET TER LAST YEAR I HAVE ASSIGNED FIX TO A HOUSE IN TOWN WHICH I FOUND TO BE THE NEAREST NUMBER IN SOME PARISHES BY AN ACCOUNT TAKEN BUT I THINK IT IS STILL MORE PLAIN IN THE COUNTRY THAT SIX IS THE NUMBER TO BE FIXED ON WHERE PEOPLE DO NOT GO SO MUCH INTO SINGLE LIFE AND WHERE THERE ARE NOT SO MANY LODGERS FOR IF WE CONSIDER THAT FOR EVERY MARRIAGE THERE ARE FOUR270 FOUR BIRTHS AT AN AVERAGE AS DR DERHAM MAJOR GRAUNT AND OTHERS HAVE SHEWN AND WHICH I HAVE FOUND TO BE TRUE FROM THE REGISTERS BOTH IN THE TOWN AND COUNTRY THEN CONSEQUENTLY ALLOWING FOR DEATHS THERE CANNOT BE THREE CHILDREN THAT SURVIVE FROM EVERY MARRIAGE TO MATURE AGE AND INDEED NOT MUCH ABOVE TWO AS APPEARS FROM DR HALLEYS TABLE OF THE PRO BABILITY OF LIFE AND THEREFORE EVERY FAMILY WHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN ONE WITH ANOTHER CANNOT CONSIST OF MORE THAN BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE PERSONS BESIDES SERVANTS OR INMATES WHICH SHEWS PLAINLY THAT FAMI LIES WHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN CANNOT BE ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN SIX TO A HOUSE AND WHERE THERE ARE NO CHILDREN THEY CANNOT BE RECKONED MORE AT AN AVERAGE THE NUMBER THEN BEING SIX TO BE ASSUMED LET US NEXT CONSIDER WHAT NUMBER OF HOUSES IS TO BE SUPPOSED THAT I MIGHT COME AT SOME CERTAINTY IN THIS I LATELY APPLIED TO ONE OF THE PUBLIC OFFICES WHERE I THOUGHT THEY COULD VERY LIKELY GIVE ME AN ACCOUNT OF THEM AND I THERE FOUND THAT BEFORE THE YEAR 1710 AND NEAR ABOUT THAT TIME AN ACCOUNT HAD BEEN TAKEN OF ALL THE HOUSES THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND WALES IN OR DER FOR SOME ASSESSMENT UPON THEM AND THE NUMBER THEN DID AMOUNT TO 729048 IN WHICH IT MAY BE SUPPOSED THAT A NUMBER OF COTTAGES WERE OMITTED THAT MIGHT BE IMPROPER FOR THAT ASSESSMENT BUT I THINK THERE COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE ABOVE ONEFOURTH PART OF THAT NUMBER MORE FOR SURELY THE SURVEYORS IF THEY HAD ANY CARE OF THE PUBLIC REVENUE WOULD NEVER OMIT ABOVE ONE IN FIVE LET US THEREFORE SUP POSE THAT THERE MIGHT BE ONEFOURTH PART OF THAT NUMBER MORE AND THEN THOSE OMITTED WILL BE ABOUT 182262 AND THE WHOLE NUMBER OF HOUSES COULD NOT EXCEED 911310 IF271 IF NOW WE TAKE 911310 FOR THE NUMBER IT IS EVI DENT IF WE ALLOW SIX PERSONS TO A HOUSE AT AN AVER AGE ACCORDING TO WHAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED THE NUMBER OF PERSONS THROUGH ENGLAND AND WALES BE FORE THE YEAR 1710 COULD NOT BE ABOVE 5467860 AND SINCE THAT TIME 45 YEARS AGO BY A METHOD OF COMPUTING WHICH I SHALL PRESENTLY SHEW THE INCREASE COULD NOT BE ABOVE 789558 AND SO THE WHOLE NUM BER OF PEOPLE NOW MUST BE ABOUT 6257418 OR SIX MILLIONS ALL AGES INCLUDED FOR IT MUST BE REMEM BERED THAT IN OUR WARS SINCE 1710 THERE COULD NOT BE FEWER LOST THAN 200000 WHICH IS TO BE DEDUCTED FROM THAT NUMBER AS TO THE OTHER WAY OF DETERMINING THIS BY CON SIDERING THE QUANTITY OF BREAD THAT IS CONSUMED IT MAY PERHAPS AT FIRST VIEW APPEAR MORE UNCERTAIN BUT IT WILL I THINK FROM SOME THINGS THAT MAY BE OB SERVED AT LEAST HELP TO ASCERTAIN THE ABOVE NUMBER FOR IT IS PLAIN IF THE QUANTITY OF WHEAT THAT IS PRO DUCED IN ENGLAND COULD BE KNOWN IT WOULD THEN BE VERY EASY TO MAKE THE COMPUTATION AS IT MIGHT BE NEARLY DISCOVERED BY A LITTLE OBSERVATION WHAT EACH PERSON AT AN AVERAGE MIGHT CONSUME BUT THE GREAT DIFFICULTY IS TO FIND OUT NEARLY THE QUANTITY OF WHEAT AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY AT PRESENT OF KNOWING IT BUT BY CONSIDERING WHAT PROPORTION IT MAY HAVE TO THE BARLEY FOR THE QUANTITY OF THAT IS NEARLY KNOWN FROM THE MALTTAX NOW IF WE COMPARE THE QUANTITY OF THE BARLEY WITH THAT OF THE WHEAT IN ENGLAND IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE IS AT LEAST AS MUCH GROUND SOWED WITH THE ONE AS WITH THE OTHER FOR THERE ARE VAST TRACTS OF LAND THAT WILL NOT BEAR GOOD WHEAT BUT ARE FREQUENTLY SOWED WITH272 WITH BARLEY AND EVEN THOSE LANDS THAT WILL PRODUCE GOOD WHEAT THEY ARE OFTEN ALTERNATELY SOWED WITH IT THE LAND THAT IS RICH AND WELL MANURED AFTER ONE CROP OF WHEAT IT IS USUAL TO SOW IT WITH BARLEY AND IF THIS BE ADMITTED THAT THE QUANTITY OF LAND SOWED WITH THE ONE IS EQUAL TO THAT SOWED WITH THE OTHER THERE MUST THEN BE A MUCH GREATER QUANTITY OF BARLEY BECAUSE THE SAME NUMBER OF ACRES WILL PRODUCE MUCH MORE OF IT AND GENERALLY IN A GREATER PROPORTION THAN THREE TO TWO THESE FACTS ARE SO WELL KNOWN THAT I BELIEVE EVERY REASONABLE FARMER WHEN HE CON SIDERS THEM TOGETHER WILL ALLOW THAT THE BARLEY CAN NOT BE IN A LESS PROPORTION TO THE WHEAT THAN THREE TO TWO IF THEN WE ALLOW TO MAKE A CALCULATION THAT THEY ARE IN THIS PROPORTION THOUGH I THINK FROM WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED IN THE COUNTRY THE DIFFERENCE IS GREATER WE SHALL THEN NEARLY FIND THE QUANTITY OF WHEAT FROM THE MALTTAX BECAUSE THE GENERAL CON SUMPTION OF BARLEY IS IN MALT TO STATE THIS AS EX ACTLY AS WE CAN IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THERE ARE ABOUT 500000 QUARTERS OF WHEAT ALMOST ANNUALLY EXPORTED AS APPEARS FROM THE BOUNTYMONEY PAID BY THE GOVERNMENT AND SOME OF IT IS MADE USE OF IN MECHANICAL PURPOSES AT HOME BESIDES FOOD AND ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS SOME BARLEY EXPORTED THOUGH NOTHING NEAR TO THE QUANTITY OF WHEAT AND A GREAT DEAL OF IT GIVEN TO FATTEN HOGS SO THAT THE BARLEY EXPORTED AND WHAT IS GIVEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF FATTENING MAY BE THOUGHT TO BE EQUAL OR MORE THAN THE WHEAT EXPORTED TOGETHER WITH WHAT IS USED FOR MECHANICAL PURPOSES LET US IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE EQUAL FOR THE ERROR WILL NOT BE GREAT IN THIS GROSS MANNER273 MANNER OF COMPUTING AND THEN THE REMAINING QUAN TITY USED IN MALT MUST BE IN A GREATER PROPORTION TO THE REMAINDER OF THE WHEAT USED IN FOOD THAN THREE TO TWO IF THEN WE ASSUME THIS THAT THE BARLEY USED IN MALT IS TO THE WHEAT USED IN FOOD AT HOME AS THREE TO TWO THOUGH I BELIEVE THE MALT IS IN A GREATER PROPORTION TO THE WHEAT WE SHALL THEN BE ABLE TO COMPUTE THE QUANTITY OF EACH OF THEM IN THIS MANNER THE MALT TAX FROM THE YEAR 1747 TO THE YEAR 1753 INCLUSIVE AMOUNTED TO THE SUM OF 4254813 L OF WHICH THE SEVENTH PART THE TAX FOR ONE YEAR IS 607830 L AND AS THE TAX IS FOUR SHILLINGS UPON EVERY QUARTER OF BAR LEY IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE ARE 3039150 QUARTERS OF BARLEY CONSUMED YEARLY IN MALT AND THEREFORE BY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE THAT THIS QUANTITY CANNOT BE IN A LESS PROPORTION TO THE WHEAT THAN THREE TO TWO THERE MUST BE 2026100 QUARTERS OF WHEAT CON SUMED AT HOME NOW AS IT IS KNOWN AND I HAVE OBSERVED IT IN THE COUNTRY THAT LABOURING HEALTHY PEOPLE AT AN AVERAGE CONSUME ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF WHEAT IN THE YEAR WHICH IS ABOUT 512 POUNDS OF FLOWER OR ONE POUND AND SIX OUNCES IN A DAY WE MAY ALLOW THAT HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY GROWN PEOPLE AND CHILDREN DO NOT CONSUME THE HALF OF THAT QUAN TITY ONE WITH ANOTHER AND THEREFORE THAT WE MAY MAKE THE CONSUMPTION OF EACH PERSON AT AN AVERAGE AS SMALL AS CAN REASONABLY BE IMAGINED WE WILL SUP POSE THAT THREE PEOPLE CHILDREN INCLUDED DO NOT CON SUME MORE THAN ONE HEARTY LABOURING PERSON THATIS ONE QUARTER IN THE YEAR OR EACH PERSON ABOUT SEVEN OUNCES IN A DAY AND BY THIS SUPPOSITION THE ABOVE NUMBER OF QUARTERS OF WHEAT 2026100 CONSUMED AT HOME VOL 49 N N WILL274 WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR 6078300 OR SIX MILLIONS OF PEO PLE AND THIS QUANTITY OF A QUARTER TO THREE PER SONS THOUGH IT APPEARS TOO LITTLE MAY BE ADMITTED AS IN SOME OF THE NORTHERN COUNTIES THEY USE SOME OATBREAD AND RYEBREAD AND EVERY HEALTHY PERSON MAY ONE WITH ANOTHER BE ALLOWED TO CONSUME THIS QUANTITY AT LEAST FROM THIS CALCULATION IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE EVIDENT THAT THERE CANNOT BE ABOVE SIX MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND FOR THE BARLEY IS CERTAINLY NOT IN A LESS PROPORTION TO THE WHEAT THAN THREE TO TWO AND THE QUANTITY OF WHEAT EXPORTED AND USED IN MECHA NICAL PURPOSES AT HOME IS NOT MUCH LESS THAN THE BAR LEY USED IN FATTENING TOGETHER WITH WHAT IS EXPORTED AND THEREFORE THE QUANTITY OF WHEAT USED IN FOOD AT HOME CANNOT EXCEED 2026100 QUARTERS WHICH COM PUTED AT ANY REASONABLE RATE WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR MORE THAN SIX MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BECAUSE IT MUST ALWAYS BE SUPPOSED THAT LABOURING PERSONS OR THOSE IN LOWER LIFE WHO HAVE NO GREAT VARIETY OF FOOD CON SUME MUCH MORE BREAD OR FOOD OF WHEAT THAN OTHERS IN A MORE WEALTHY CONDITION AND SEVEN OUNCES A DAY AT AN AVERAGE IS RATHER TOO LITTLE ALLOWANCE AND AS FROM THE OTHER METHOD OF COMPUTING FROM HOUSES WE FOUND THE NUMBER TO BE ABOUT 6257400 FROM WHICH AT LEAST 200000 IS TO BE TAKEN FOR THOSE LOST IN OUR WARS SINCE 1710 OR NEAR THAT TIME IT AP PEARS THAT BOTH THESE CALCULATIONS CONFIRM ONE AN OTHER AND THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MAY BE CON SIDERED AT ABOUT SIX MILLIONS OR RATHER LESS IN WHICH ACCORDING TO DR HALLEYS RULE THERE WILL BE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN ABLE TO CARRY ARMS THE275 THE WORTHY DR DERHAM FROM THE COMPUTATIONS OF MR KING WHICH I NEVER SAW SUPPOSES THERE IS ABOUT FIVE MILLIONS AND AN HALF OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND TO WHICH IF WE ADD THE INCREASE THAT MAY BE SINCE THAT TIME THE NUMBER WILL BE NEAR ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE MADE THEM BUT SIR WILLIAM PETTY HAS EN DEAVOURED TO MAKE THEM IN HIS TIME NO LESS THAN 7369000 BY SUPPOSING THEM TO BE IN PROPORTION TO THE ASSESSMENT THEN ELEVEN TIMES GREATER THAN THAT IN THE CITY OF LONDON IN WHICH WITH REGARD TO THE CITY HE WAS CERTAINLY MISTAKEN AS I HAVE SHEWN LAST YEAR FOR THE NUMBER AT THAT TIME IN 1682 WAS NOT MUCH ABOVE 504000 AND THEREFORE ELEVEN TIMES THAT VIZ 5544000 MUST ACCORDING TO HIS OWN HYPOTHESIS BE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND IF WE ALLOW 1355000 TO BE THE INCREASE IN ABOUT 73 YEARS SINCE THAT TIME BY THE METHOD I SHALL PRESENTLY SHEW THE NUMBER COULD NOT BE NOW ACCORDING TO THAT ASSESSMENT ABOVE 6899000 FROM WHICH WE OUGHT AT LEAST TO SUBTRACT 400000 WHICH MAY BE JUSTLY AL LOWED FOR LOSS IN OUR WARS SINCE 1690 AND THE RE MAINDER 6499000 IS NOT HALF A MILLION MORE THAN WE HAVE MADE THEM BUT TO COMPUTE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM ANY PECUNIARY ASSESSMENT THAT MUST ARISE FROM TRADE CIRCUMSTANCES AND VALUATION OF LAND SEEMS TO ME TO BE A MUCH MORE UNCERTAIN ME THOD THAN EITHER OF THESE I HAVE USED THE PEOPLE THEN BEING COMPUTED AT SIX MILLIONS OR RATHER LESS IT APPEARS THAT ENGLAND IS BUT THINLY PEOPLED FOR NOT ONLY THE EXPORTATION OF AT LEAST 400000 QUARTERS OF WHEAT ANNUALLY SHEWS PLAINLY THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO CONSUME IT AT HOME AND THAT WE MAINTAIN IN BREAD ABOUT A MILLION OF FOREIGNERS ABROAD N N 2 BUT276 BUT IF WE EXAMINE MORE PARTICULARLY WE SHALL FIND THAT THE COUNTRY IS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING ONEHALF MORE INHABITANTS OR NINE MILLIONS ACCORDING TO MR TEMPLEMANS SURVEY ENGLAND CONTAINS 49450 SQUARE MILES THAT IS 31648000 ACRES BECAUSE A SQUARE MILE IS EQUAL TO 640 ACRES AND IF WE SUP POSE ONEFIFTH OF IT WASTE GROUND HEATHS C THERE WILL REMAIN ABOUT 25300000 ACRES OF LAND PROPER TO BE CULTIVATED AND AS IT CAN EASILY BE MADE AP PEAR THAT THREE ACRES WELL MANURED IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF ONE PERSON I MEAN IF A GREAT NUM BER OF ACRES ARE TAKEN TOGETHER TO PRODUCE THE VARIOUS NECESSARIES OF LIFE IN VICTUALS AND CLOATHING THEN THERE WILL BE MAINTENANCE IN ENGLAND FOR 8430000 PEOPLE CHILDREN INCLUDED WHICH WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF FISHING THAT THE SITUATION OF THE COUNTRY GIVES WE MAY WELL ALLOW THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROVISION FOR NINE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT IS THREE MILLIONS MORE THAN WE HAVE AT PRESENT AND THIS IS ONLY FROM THE NATURAL PRODUCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE ADVANTAGES FROM TRADE AND THE HELP OF OUR COLONIES IN AMERICA BY WHICH DOUBLE THE NUMBER MIGHT BE MAINTAINED THE ABOVE ALLOWANCE OF THREE ACRES TO EACH PERSON I THINK IS TOO MUCH BUT SOME CONSIDERATION MUST BE HAD OF THE INCLOSURES AND PLEASUREGROUNDS WHICH THOSE IN HIGHER LIFE WILL ALWAYS HAVE BUT IN IRELAND THE CASE IS STILL WORSE FOR IF THERE IS BUT A MILLION OF PEOPLE AS IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED AND ACCORDING TO MR TEMPLEMAN 27400 SQUARE MILES WHICH IS 17536000 ACRES AND ONEFOURTH OR MORE BE SUPPOSED WASTE THEN THERE WILL BE AT LEAST 12000000 GOOD ACRES AND CONSEQUENTLY IF FOUR ACRES IN THAT COUNTRY BE ALLOWED SUFFICIENT AT AN AVERAGE277 AVERAGE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF ONE PERSON IRELAND IF DULY CULTIVATED COULD MAINTAIN TWO MILLIONS MORE PEOPLE THAN IT HAS NOW OR THREE TIMES ITS PRESENT NUMBER OF INHABITANTS AND IN SCOTLAND IF THERE BE AS IS SAID BUT A MIL LION AND AN HALF OF PEOPLE FOR AT PRESENT I KNOW NO WAY TO COMPUTE THEM AND 27700 SQUARE MILES OR 17728000 ACRES AND ONETHIRD BE SUPPOSED WASTE WHICH IS NOT TOO MUCH IN THAT COUNTRY THEN THERE WILL BE 11000000 GOOD ACRES OF WHICH IF WE SUP POSE THAT FIVE ACRES OF THAT SOIL IS NOT MORE THAN SUF FICIENT FOR EACH PERSON THEN THERE MAY BE PROVISION FOR 2200000 PEOPLE OR MORE WITH THE ADVANTAGES OF FISHING THAT IS 700000 MORE THAN THERE ARE AT PRESENT FROM ALL WHICH IT IS PLAIN THAT IF THE LAND IN BOTH THE BRITISH ISLES WAS DULY CULTIVATED THEY MIGHT SUSTAIN ABOUT SIX MILLIONS MORE PEOPLE THAN THEY DO NOW THAT IS AS MANY MORE PEOPLE AS ENGLAND NOW CONTAINS AND THIS PROPORTION OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO THE QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS THAT MAY BE RAISED FOR THEM FROM THE NATURAL PRODUCE OF THE COUNTRY I THINK IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO CONSIDER AS IT HAS MANY USE FUL CONSEQUENCES SOME OF WHICH MIGHT BE MEN TIONED IF THIS WAS A PROPER PLACE FOR POLITICAL RE FLECTIONS AND HERE BY THE WAY IT MAY BE OBSERVED IF WE EXTEND OUR THOUGHTS TO THE WHOLE GLOBE OF THE EARTH AND COMPARE THE QUANTITY OF LAND WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE SHALL FIND THAT IT WILL MAINTAIN ABOVE TWENTYSIX TIMES THE PRESENT NUMBER OF MANKIND AS THIS HAS HITHERTO NOT BEEN TAKEN NOTICE OF I SHALL BRIEFLY SHEW IT THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE EARTH SUP POSING IT TO BE A SPHERE IS ACCORDING TO THE MEA SURES278 SURES OF MESSIEURS PICARD AND CASSINI 123249600 PARIS FEET OR 131630572 ENGLISH FEET WHICH IS 24930 ENGLISH MILES AND THE DIAMETER IS 7935 ENG LISH MILES AND THEN THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BY PROP 38 LIB 1 ARCHIM DE SPHAERA  CYLINDRO IS 24930 X 7935  197819550 SQUARE MILES AND AS THE WHOLE SURFACE IS TO THE QUANTITY OF LAND NEAR ABOUT 8 TO 3 THE LAND WILL THEN BE 74182331 SQUARE MILES OF WHICH IF WE ALLOW ONETHIRD TO BE WASTE GROUND OR UNFIT TO PRODUCE THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE WE SHALL HAVE 49454887 SQUARE MILES OR 49454887 X 640  31651127680 GOOD ACRES NOW THE NUM BER OF MANKIND OVER THE WHOLE GLOBE IS COMPUTED BY SIR W PETTY AND OTHERS TO BE UNDER 350000000 BUT WE WILL SUPPOSE THEM 400000000 WHICH IS SURELY MORE THAN THEIR NUMBER THAT WE MAY AVOID ANY UNCERTAINTY IN COMPUTATION AND THEN THERE WILL BE 79 GOOD ACRES TO EACH PERSON FROM WHICH IT IS EVIDENT IF THE SOIL IN ENGLAND BE CONSIDERED AS A MEDIUM BETWEEN THE POOR LANDS IN THE NORTHERN CLI MATES AND THE VERY FERTILE IN THE SOUTHERN AND THREE ACRES BE HERE SUFFICIENT FOR ONE PERSON THAT THE EARTH CAN MAINTAIN MORE THAN TWENTYSIX TIMES ITS PRESENT NUMBER OF INHABITANTS AND IF WE IMAGINE THE LAND TO BE IN A GREATER PROPORTION TO THE SURFACE THAN 3 TO 8 AND THE NUMBER OF MANKIND LESS THAN WE HAVE SUPPOSED THE PRODUCE OF THE EARTH WILL THEN BE IN A GREATER PROPORTION TO THEM AND HENCE IT PLAINLY APPEARS THAT THE EARTH IS IN A VERY IMPERFECT STATE WITH REGARD TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THAT IF BIRTHS AND BURIALS ARE SUPPOSED NEARLY IN THE SAME PRO PORTION ALL OVER THE GLOBE AS IN ENGLAND IT WILL BE ABOVE 1000 YEARS BEFORE THE EARTH CAN BE FULLY PEOPLED279 PEOPLED FROM WHICH IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THE ORIGIN OF MANKIND IS NOT MORE ANTIENT THAN IS COM MONLY BELIEVED BUT NOW TO RETURN TO OUR PURPOSE LET US IN THE NEXT PLACE SEE WHAT MAY BE THE ANNUAL INCREASE OF THE PEOPLE IN ENGLAND THAT WE MAV BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF THE FUTURE IMPROVEMENT OF THE COUNTRY DR DER HAM IN HIS PHYSICOTHEOLOGY HAS SHEWN FROM SOME OBSERVATIONS COMMUNICATED TO HIM THAT THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS ARE ANNUALLY TO THE BURIALS THROUGH ENG LAND IN GENERAL AS 112 TO 1 THOUGH I SHOULD IMA GINE THE BIRTHS IF THERE WAS AN EXACT ACCOUNT TAKEN WOULD BE IN A LITTLE GREATER PROPORTION FROM WHICH IF WE COULD KNOW THE NUMBER OF THE BURIALS THE INCREASE WOULD BE EASILY FOUND AND IN MY LETTER LAST YEAR I HAVE THERE MADE IT APPEAR THAT WITHIN THE BILLS OF MORTALITY THERE DIE ABOUT ONE IN THIRTY AND IN SOME VERY HEALTHY PLACES IN THE COUNTRY ABOUT ONE IN FIFTY WHICH SEEM TO ME TO BE THE TWO EXTREME DEGREES OF HEALTH IN ENGLAND SO THAT IN MANY TOWNS AND IN FENNY OR MARSHY LANDS THE DEGREES OF HEALTH MUST BE BETWEEN THESE TWO LET US NOW TAKE THE MEAN BETWEEN THEM WHICH IS ONE IN FORTY AND THIS WILL BE NEARLY AT AN AVERAGE THE DEGREE OF HEALTH THROUGH ENGLAND OR PERHAPS BRITAIN IN GENERAL AS SIR WILLIAM PETTY HAS OBSERVED AND WHICH WILL VERY WELL SERVE TO MAKE A CALCULATION OF THE INCREASE OF THE PEOPLE FOR THEN IF WE SUPPOSE THE WHOLE NUMBER TO BE 6000000 THE FORTIETH PART OF IT VIZ 150000 WILL BE THE NUMBER OF THE DEAD YEARLY AND THE BIRTHS FROM THE PROPORTION OF 1 TO 112 WILL BE 168000 FROM WHICH IF WE TAKE THE NUMBER OF DEAD THE REMAINDER 18000 MUST BE THE ANNUAL IN CREASE280 CREASE WHICH INDEED IS VERY SMALL AND I BELIEVE MUCH DIMINISHED BY THE EMIGRATION OF GREAT NUM BERS TO OUR COLONIES IN AMERICA AND SETTLEMENTS ELSE WHERE OR BY OUR WARS AND LOSSES AT SEA SO THAT IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE ACCESSION OF FOREIGNERS AND THOSE WHO COME FROM SCOTLAND AND IRELAND THE INCREASE WOULD BE VERY INCONSIDERABLE IF ANY AT ALL WHICH BY THE WAY SHEWS THE REASONABLENESS AND GOOD POLICY OF ENCOURAGING FOREIGNERS TO SETTLE AMONG US HOW EVER LET US SUPPOSE THE ANNUAL INCREASE TO BE 18000 AND IT WILL BE EASY FROM THENCE TO FIND IN WHAT TIME THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE MAY BE DOUBLE OR IN ANY GIVEN PROPORTION NOT BY DIVIDING 6000000 BY 18000 CONSIDERING THE ANNUAL INCREASE AS A CONSTANT QUANTITY WHICH IS THE METHOD SIR WILLIAM PETTY USES BY MIS TAKE OR PERHAPS NOT KNOWING HOW TO DO IT OTHER WISE BUT BY MAKING THIS ANNUAL INCREASE CONTINUALLY TO INCREASE AS THE WHOLE NUMBER DOES LET US PRO POSE THE QUESTION FIRST IN GENERAL THE NUMBER OF PEO PLE BEING UNKNOWN WHICH IS THIS THE PROPORTION BEING GIVEN OF THE LIVING TO THE DEAD IN ONE YEAR AND ALSO THE PROPORTION OF THE BIRTHS TO THE DEAD THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE BE ING UNKNOWN TO FIND IN WHAT TIME THE PEOPLE SHALL BE IN ANY GIVEN PROPORTION TO WHAT THEY ARE AT PRE SENT SUPPOSE N TO BE THE UNKNOWN NUMBER OF THE PEO PLE AT PRESENT AND LET THE LIVING BE TO THE DEAD IN ONE YEAR AS L TO 1 AND THE DEAD TO THE BIRTHS AS 1 TO B THE PROPORTION GIVEN TO WHAT THEIR NUMBER IS AT PRESENT AS P TO 1 AND THE NUMBER OF YEARS REQUIRED TO BE Y IT281 IT IS PLAIN THEN THAT THE DEAD AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR WILL BE NL AND THE BIRTHS BNL AND THE WHOLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MUST BE N  BNL  NL IN LIKE MANNER AT THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR THE DEAD WILL BE LN  BN  NL2 AND THE BIRTHS L B N  B B N  N BL2 AND THE WHOLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MUST BE N  B NL  NL  L B N  B B N  N BL2  N  L N  B NL2  N X  L  B  1 X  L  B  1L2 AND SO AT THE END OF THE THIRD YEAR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL BE N X  L  B  1 L3 FROM WHICH AT LENGTH IT IS EVIDENT BY INDUCTION THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT THE END OF THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF YEARS WILL BE N X  L  B  1  YL Y BUT AS THE PROPORTION IS THEN TO BE AS P TO 1 WE SHALL HAVE N X  L  B  1  YL Y  P N AND FROM THENCE  L  B  1  Y  P LY AND BECAUSE THE LOGARITHMS OF EQUAL QUANTITIES MUST BE EQUAL WE SHALL HAVE Y X LOG  L  B  1  LOG P  Y X LOG L AND ALSO Y  LOG PLOG  L  B  1  LOGL AND THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF YEARS Y IS DETERMINED BY THE LOGARITHMS OF KNOWN QUANTITIES WHEN THE PEOPLE SHALL BE IN THE GIVEN PROPORTION OF P TO 1 IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT THE QUANTITY N X  L  B  1  LY MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE ORDINATE OF THE LOGARITHMIC CURVE WHOSE ABSCISSE IS THE INDEX Y AND THAT THE VOL 49 O O ORDINATE282 ORDINATE PASSING THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE ABSCISSE WHERE Y  0 MUST BE EQUAL TO N IF NOW IT BE REQUIRED TO KNOW WHEN THE PEOPLE SHALL BE DOUBLED LET US SUBSTITUTE IN THE ABOVE FOR MULA IN PLACE OF B L P THE RESPECTIVE NUMBERS 1 12 40 2 AND IT WILL BE Y  LOG 2LOG  40  1 12  1  LOG 40 AND THEN THE LOGARITHMS BEING TAKEN WE SHALL HAVE Y  0301030000013009  231 WHICH SHEWS THAT ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT STATE OF BIRTHS AND BURIALS THE PEOPLE COULD NOT BE DOUBLED IN LESS THAN 231 YEARS AND BY THE SAME METHOD IT APPEARS CHANGING THE SIGNS OF B  1 THAT 230 YEARS AGO IN THE TIME OF HENRY THE VIIITH THE NUMBER COULD NOT BE ABOVE ONEHALF OF WHAT IT IS NOW THAT IS ABOUT 3000000 AND SO IF WE WERE TO FIND WHEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND WOULD BE INCREASED TO NINE MIL LIONS WHICH BY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOVE IS NEAR ABOUT THE OUTMOST THAT CAN BE MAINTAINED FROM THE NATURAL PRODUCE OF THE COUNTRY WE SHOULD THEN HAVE P  82  1 5 BECAUSE NINE MILLIONS IS TO THE PRESENT NUMBER AS 3 TO 2 AND ALSO Y  LOG 1 5LOG  40  1 12  1  LOG 40  0176091300013009  135 WHICH SHEWS THAT AT THE PRESENT RATE OF BIRTHS AND BURIALS IT MUST BE 135 YEARS BEFORE ENGLAND CAN BE FULLY PEOPLED IF WE SUPPOSE AS SIR WILLIAM PETTY DOES THAT THE BURIALS ARE TO THE BIRTHS AS 9 TO 10 THAT IS 1 TO 1 111 WHICH IS SOMETHING LESS THAN THAT OF DR DERHAMS PROPORTION AND THAT ONE DIES IN 40 IN A YEAR IF WE SUBSTITUTE283 SUBSTITUTE THESE NUMBERS IN THE FORMULA WE SHALL THEN FIND THE TIME OF DOUBLING TO BE 250 YEARS FOR THEN IT WILL BE Y  LOG 2LOG  40  1 111  1  LOG 40  0301030000012035  250 WHICH SHEWS HOW FAR SIR WILLIAM WAS MISTAKEN IN HIS METHOD OF CALCULATION WHEN HE MADE THE TIME TO BE 360 YEARS AFTER THE SAME MANNER THE NUMBER OF YEARS BE ING GIVEN IT WILL BE EASY TO FIND THE PROPORTIONAL IN CREASE SUPPOSE AFTER 45 YEARS FOR THEN WE SHOULD HAVE 45 X LOG  L  B  1  45 X LOG L  LOG P WHICH WILL GIVE 45 X 00013009  LOG P AND THERE FORE P  11443 FROM WHICH IF N BE EQUAL TO 5467860 WE HAVE P N  6256872 SO THAT IT AP PEARS IF THERE WAS 5467860 OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AT THE YEAR 1710 WHEN THE ABOVEMENTIONED SURVEY WAS MADE THERE IS NOW 6250000 IF THERE WAS NONE TO BE DEDUCTED UPON THE ACCOUNT OF OUR WARS AND EMI GRATIONS TO OUR COLONIES SINCE THAT TIME FROM WHAT HAS BEEN FOUND ABOVE THAT  L  B  1  Y  P LY IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE RATIO OF THE INCREASE IN ANY NUMBER OF YEARS MAY BE DETERMINED WITHOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING KNOWN OR THEIR PROPOR TION TO THE ANNUAL INCREASE AND ALSO THAT ANY ONE OF THE QUANTITIES L B Y P MAY BE FOUND THE OTHERS BE ING KNOWN BUT IF THE RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF PEO PLE TO THE ANNUAL INCREASE BE KNOWN AND CONSE QUENTLY THE PROPORTION OF THE NUMBER IN ANY ONE YEAR TO THE NUMBER NEXT YEAR KNOWN WE SHALL THEN HAVE A VERY SIMPLE EQUATION FOR IF WE SUP POSE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ANY ONE YEAR TO BE O O 2 TO284 TO THAT NUMBER WITH THE INCREASE ADDED IN THE NEXT YEAR AS 1 TO R WE SHALL THEN HAVE N RY  N P OR RY  P AND IN LIKE MANNER IF THE PROPORTION OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO THEIR INCREASE IN A GIVEN CYCLE OF YEARS HAD ONLY BEEN KNOWN AND THAT CY CLE BE C WE SHOULD THEN HAVE N RYC  N P OR RYC  P FROM WHICH FORMULA IT WOULD BE EASY TO CALCU LATE THE NUMBERS OF MANKIND IN ALL AGES THROUGH THE WORLD IF WE SUPPOSE THEM TO ARISE FROM A GIVEN NUMBER AND THE RATE OF INCREASE KNOWN IN ANY PERIOD OF YEARS AND THIS MAY SOMETIMES BE OF USE TO DISCOVER THE NUMBER IN ANY AGE THAT MIGHT BE POS SIBLE TO REASON UPON AND TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH OF ANY HYPOTHESIS BUT I SHALL NOT ENTER UPON IT FARTHER AS SUCH CALCULATIONS ARE LIABLE TO GREAT UNCERTAINTY FROM THE FREQUENT AND VARIOUS DEVASTATIONS OF MAN KIND AND THUS I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DISCOVER THE NUM BER OF THE PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND THE RATE OF THEIR INCREASE FROM THE FEW THINGS I HAD KNOWN WHICH I THINK ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT I CANNOT BE FAR MIS TAKEN I HAVE INDEED MADE THEM FEWER THAN THEY ARE COMMONLY BELIEVED BUT IF I AM RIGHT IT WILL BE SO MUCH THE BETTER TO BE UNDECEIVED IN A MATTER OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE YOU WILL EASILY DISCERN FROM YOUR EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE WHERE I HAVE FAILED WHICH AS THE SUBJECT IS SO DIFFICULT I HOPE YOU WILL MORE READILY EXCUSE AND PRAY LET ME HAVE YOUR REMARKS IN THE FREEST MANNER ON THE WHOLE WHICH WILL GREATLY OBLIGE DEAR SIR YOUR MOST FAITHFUL SERVANT SIONCOLLEGE NOV 19 1755 WM BRAKENRIDGE P S285 P S I FIND SOME GENTLEMEN HAVE OBJECTED TO MY ACCOUNT LAST YEAR OF THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE LONDON BILLS OF MORTALITY THAT THE DI MINUTION OF THE BURIALS MAY ONLY BE OWING TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF HEALTH THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS AND NOT TO ANY DECREASE OF THE NUMBER OF THE LIVING BUT THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE NOT ATTENDED TO WHAT IS THERE SHEWN IN THE TABLE THAT THE BIRTHS ARE ALSO GREATLY DIMINISHED AND THAT FROM THE DECREASE OF BOTH TOGETHER IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FEWER FOR IF GREATER HEALTH WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DECREASE OF THE BURIALS THE BIRTHS FOR THAT REASON OUGHT RATHER TO BE MORE THE TRUTH IS THE DECREASE OF THE PEO PLE DIMINISHES THE PRACTICE OF PHYSIC WHICH MAKES SOME OF THAT PROFESSION IMAGINE THAT THE TIMES ARE MORE HEALTHY

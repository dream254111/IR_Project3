Prussian Landtag is of more than usual interest and importance No session for several years has been so fruitful in reform measures an outbreak of leg islative activity which is directly traceable to the initiative of the energetic young emperor and his new ministers The present Landtag was elected in 1888 but in the two sessions held under the ministry of Bismarck it did little more than discuss and accept the annual budgets Under the new regime it may perhaps merit the title of the reform Landtag sometimes bestowed upon it by the German press None of the reforms attracted more attention or had been more generally demanded than that of the income tax This tax has existed in Prussia since 1851 when it was introduced to supplement or reform the class tax which had been adopted in 1820 This in turn had as its forerunner the uniform personal or poll tax of 1811 which was the beginning of direct personal taxation in the Prussian state and may be regarded as the rermn of the present progressive income tax the historical development of which is an interesting and instructive study The poll tax of 1811 was a modest beginning It was con fined to the country districts where it collected one grosehen a month amounting to onehalf thaler a year from all persons over twelve years of age without regard to differences of wealth or social station It was not adopted to increase taxa tion l4ut simply to replace as a source of revenue the grist tax which had been introduced a year before but had given rise to so much dissatisfaction and evasion among the peas ants and farmers that its retention outside of the cities was thought inadvisable The poll tax proved more acceptable to the country people and less difficult to collect This was a period however when other and more radical208 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS tax reforms were imperatively demanded As a result of the Napoleonic wars and of political changes and constitutional reforms the public revenues hal become altogether insufficient for the needs of the state and an increase of taxation could not be avoided In 1812 a premature attempt was made to introduce a general property and income tax  but the rates were unreasonably high the income tax being 5 per cent on all incomes above 300 thalers 1 per cent on those between 100 and 300 thalers while incomes under 100 thalers were taxed in two classes with the annual rates of 3 and I thaler The property tax which however had in part the nature of a forced loan was 3 per cent A burden so excessively heavy says Cohn  could only be imlosed by the state in case of the direst need and then only temporarily The edict was repealed in less than a year and a half after its pro murlgation and must be regarded as an episode rather than a chapter in the continuous development of the Prussian in come tax It may be said however to have had a certain negative effect on subsequent legislation since it was doubtless one cause of the disfavor with which for a long time after wards an income tax was regarded After this failure the Prussian statesmen turned their atten tion to the reform of the indirect taxes By 1820 this had been carried as far as seemed advisable at the time and it was estimated that there would still be an annual deficit in the revenues of about 8000000 thalers Any considerable in crease of the uniform 1oll tax was out of the question for such a tax is by its nature limited to what the poorest citizen can afford to pay The only alternative was to confine the increase of direct taxation to the more prosperous classes This it was sought to accomplish by means of a class tax in which the basis for the assessment was not the taxpayers income 1ut his social standing to which to be sure his income would in a rough way correspond The attempt was made to rate the taxpayers in four distinct social classes such as had undoubtedly existed in earlier times and had been recognized in the constitutions of medieval cities We have good au thority moreover for believing that in Germany such a classi  Finanzmwssenschaft p 415THE PR USSI iN INCOME TAX 209 fiction of society was not unnatural even much later than 1820 for J G Iloffmann one of the most distinguished statesmen of his time when he wrote his PLehre der Steuer in 1840 still believed firmly in the idea of the class tax claiming that the four classes existed and could easily he distinguished and Adolf Held writing in 1872 admitted this although he did not favor such a tax It is not to be denied he says that socially the four mentioned orders may be distinguished But as soon as we depart from the principle of a simple poll tax it is impossible to adopt the idea of noblesse oblige as our guliding principle and carry out the rule that every one shall contribute more the higher on the whole his social posi tion is On the contrary the idea inevitably forces itself into recognition that it is the richer man who should pay more and the greater the differences in wealth the more irresistible will this tendency prove to be The tendency was manifest even in 1820 For the true idea of the class tax was not consistently adhered to and in the form which the law finally took in 1821 three different rates for each of the four classes were adopted in older not to ignore wholly the differences of wealth among members of the same class This made twelve rates in all and practically twelve classes and was really a first step in the direction of a classified income tax The lowest of the monthly rates was thel same as the previous poll tax had been one groschen aln1d the highest was 12 thlalers This reform then did not diminish taxation for the poorest citizen but increased it some what on the more prosperous classes The class tax like the poll tax was not introdluced in the cities but there its equiv alent was to be a grist and slaughter tax since this was a form of taxation to which the cities had long been accustomed while a personal tax would have been an innovation not well adaptel it was thougrlht to the peculiar conditions of city life mainly because the unstable character of the population would make it difficult to collect such a tax especially from the poorer classes The law of 1821 was regarded by its supporters as a happy  Einkommensteuer p 275210 QUARTERLY JOURNYAL OF ECONOHIICS compromise between an income tax and a uniform per capita tax The former they rejected because it necessitated a minute and vexatious inquiry into the financial condition of the taxpayer the latter because of the injustice of exacting as much from the poorest as from the wealthiest citizen  and we may add because of the impossibility of collecting suffi cient revenue byr means of it It seems to have been expected that the class tax would avoid both these evils and without intruding into the private affairs of the citizen would take into account indirectly at least differences in wealth since after all the basis of the classification was property or income quite as much as social position This is clearly seen in the ministerial instructions according to which the highest class for instance was to include large landowners wholesale merchants owners of laire factories larae capttalists etc and the general rule to be observed was that the posses sion of a property or business of such an extent that the income to be expected from it insures the owner an easy and independent existence is enough to indicate that be belongs in this class At the same time in tile nextt pala graph it is insisted that anything

justify either in theory or in practice the hopes and claims of its supporters As might bhe expected of such a compromise it was not wholv free from the faults of the poll tax and did not possess all thle virtues of a true income tax A minimum annual rate of 3 thaler and a maximum of 144 thalers could not correspond to the wide difference between the incomes of the poorest and those of the richest taxpayers If the former rate was just Ithe latter was altogether too low If the law moreover avoidedl the dreaded vexatious inquiry into the private affairs of the citizens it relied too mnaich on the unguided and arbitrary judg ment of the assessors who even wlth the best intentions found it difficult to make the requi ed classification The tendency in the assessment seenis to have been towvards in creasing leniency for the proceeds of the tax although in the first instance all that had been estimated lid not increase in the followving years ill proportion to the increase of population to say nothinMg of the increase of wealth It had been thouTht that thle social pride of the taxpayer would come to the assist ance of the assessors and that he would resent being rated in a lower class than the one to which he actually belonged This psychological factor may have been effective in soime cases but in general the Prussian subject when it came teo the question of taxation did not seem to aspire eto a high social position One reason probally was th itnaong the people the tallx very poperly never came to ae reiaCled as a true class tax or a reliable criterion of social distinctions In

Still no general reform wBas attenmpted until the United Landtagr met in 1847 Then the government introduced a bill in which it was proposed to limit the class tax to those whose iinconmes were less than 400 thalers and impose an income tax on all higher incomes The rate was to be 3 per cent on the socalled funded incomes  e incomes from property or in vested capital comprising rent profits and interest and 2 per cent on the unfunded consisting of the direct earnings of labor in the form of wages salaries professional fees and the like The bill moreover adopted the principle of selfassess ment requiring the taxpayer to declare his own income The grist and slaughter tax existing as we have seen in the larger cities was to be repealed and give place to the class and in come tax But the times were not ripe for so radical a re form The proposed measure encountered strong opposition especially on the part of the wealthier classes and was finally defeated in the Landtag by a large majority In a second attempt at reform two years later the government made con cessions to the opposition by no longer insisting upon the principle of selfassessment or the distinction between funded and unfunded incomes Although this bill met with more favor it underwent many changes in the Landtar and in the end failed to pass The successful reform bill which became law in 1851 was of a still rnilder character The grist and slauglhter tax for the large cities was retained The class tax confined as be fore to tlhe smaller cities and country districts was curtailed by the abolition of the

classes In the lowest the annual rate was 30 thalers in the highest 7200 thalers These rates were grided with the intention of collecting 3 per cent of the mitiinmun income in each class This made the min imum for the highest class 240000 thalers and the amount by which any income exceeded that limit was therefore not taxed No declaration was required from the taxpayer and the assessment was to be made without inquisitorial procedure In the two previous attempts at reform the main end in view had been a more equitable distribution of the burden of taxation There had been no expectation of any considerable increase of revenue But in fraiingy the law of 1851 the need of more revenue had been the principal consideration Any sort of income tax which would meet this need was regarded as better than none It cannot be denied therefore that  the Prussian incoine tax was introduced not solely from a recog nition of its social necessity but at the same time on account of pressing financial needs  It is not strange then that the law did not fulfil the requirements of an equitable income tax Its most serious defect was the retention of a maximum limit to the rates Besides this the classification was not fine enough that is the dividing limits between the classes were too far apart The result was a rather wide variation in the rate per cent of the tax for while as we have seen it was 3 per cent of the minimum income in each class on the maximum income it was in most cases equivalent to only about 21 per cent On the whole it may be said that this reform like the introduc tion of the class tax in 1820 aimed principally at ami increase in the public revenue and obtained it by taxing the poor not less and the rich eonsidlerably more The conditions under which the next reform was accom plished in 1873 were more favorable since at that time alny increase of taxes wats not necessary On the contrary the state of the public finances was sueh  thanks to the French billiards that the people felt justified in denialsnding some  Adolpla Hell Einkontamrnsteuer p 293214 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS relief from taxation and it was partly in response to this demand that the reform was undertaken The grist and slaughter tax was repealed to be replaced in those cities where it had existed by the class tax The latter was now recognized as being in fact an income tax which was to be assessed on the basis of the estimated value of the annual incomet This was only a recognition of what had long been the case in actual practice Indeed the instructions for the assessment of the tax issued by the finance minister in 1867 had designated numerically certain incomes which were to be treated as Anrcdltspunctc in assessing the several rates and stated furthermore that the presumable income of the taxpayer was to be regarded as  not indeed the sole deter mining factor in the assessment but still the principal one t Other circumstances were also to be considered whereas the income tax was assessed  soleby on the basis of iiiconie This distinction between the two taxes was on the whole still maintained in the law of 1873 except as reglrd1s the two lowest classes of the income tax See pp 221 222o The maximum income subject to tihe class tax remained as before 100 thalers or 3000 marks but now for the first time the law also prescribed a minimum taxable

relieve the poorer classes from the buirden of taxation apparently the difficulty and eCxcense of collecting the tax from such classes especially iii the larger cities where the class tax was now to be introduced had the most to do with this new departure But in making the taw progressive or letter perhaps de gressive there was undleniably the intention of favoring the poor There were twelve rates ranging fromn 3 marks to 72 marks and the equivalent rates per cent on the minimum income of each class increased gradually from q per cent in the lowest class to 2 in the highest The tax on thie incomes at the lower end of the scale was reduced while at the nipper end it remained about as it was before In the income tax the rates were as before equivalent to 3 per cent of the minimum income of each class 1But the number of classes was increased andJ more important still the maximum limit to the tax was removedt Incomes up to 780000 marks were rated in forty classes and beyond that point the tax increased 1800 marks for every 60000 marks increase of income The same line of reform was carried a step farther in the years 1880 to 1883 An increase of revenue derived principally from the imperial tariff and tobacco tax the proceeds of which in excess of 13000000 marks are divilel among the states in the form of the socalled Uebei weisunvgen made a reduction of direct taxation possible which it was felt should accrLte to the benefit of the poorer classes With this end in view the two lowest rates of the class tax were abolislhed thus exempting all incomes up to 900 nmarks4

taxation now applied to all incomes under 4200 marks Such had been the development of the class and income tax down to the reforms of the present year The law of June 24 1891 like that of 1873 has been enacted under favorable financial conditions which relieved the government from the necessity of asking for any increase of taxes and while the reform can hardly fail to make the tax more productive a guarantee has been given that any such result shall not accrue to the benefit of the public treasury but lead to a relief from some other form of taxation or else to a reduction in the rates of the income tax itself This time it was the net earnings from the state railroads which as Cohn says made it possible to indulge in the luxury of distinguishing between a reform of the public finance and an increase of public revenue an in dulgence which lhe seems to regard as very improvident if not enervating But if fiscal motives be wholly wanting in the new law which after all there is soine reason to doubt t it only adds to the interest and significance of the reform since if the burden of taxation is to remain the same but be more justly distributed wve may draw some inferences as to what ideals of just taxation find favor in Prussia at the pres ent time even if we must premise that as is usual in tax reforms considerations of plactical expediency have had quite as much weight

departure from the principles on which the assess ment has heretofore been conducted The law of 1851 was very explicit in the assurance it gave the taxpayer that there should be no intrusion into his private business affairs To be sure the chairman of the board of assessors was to collect the fullest possible information ill regard to the financial con dition of the taxpayers lut only in so far as it could be done without a too searching inquiry o0hne tieferes Eindringen The other members of the board were to subject the chair mans results to a careful examination in which they were to make use

means that in individual cases the undervaluation has been far greater Hereafter the Prussian taxpayer must make out a written return of his income if it exceeds 3000 marks entering it under the following four heads 1 Income from invested capital ie interest and dividends 2 Income from real es tate auts Grundcterm7iogen whether derived from its use or its ownership or both 3 Profits or the

remiains to be seen but there are good reasons to believe it will not especially as this change is accompanied as we shall see by an increase in the rates on large incomes In this connection I may

Without doubt the leelaration will secure better returns than the pre vious method of assessment For once we will venture to prophesy and say that apart from the new tax on corporations and the higher rates it will secure an increase of fromn 5 to 20 per cent Had it not been for the 1iochum case we would have said 25 per cent but the alarm which this affair has occasioned may well help us to 30 per cent But by how much was the assessment too low in the Bochum case By onehalf to twothirds and even more This amount will not come to light even unler the new system So lon as we have not reached an inheritance tax and a considerable reduction in the communal surtaxes the declara tioli will be of little benefit The strictest control and a reasonable moderation in the rates without these two wNheels it is impossible to set the w agon going Prcisis che Jahrbiicher July 1891 The assessment of incomes then in Prnssia has not been so very much better thian that of iersolal property in Amer ica nor is it certain that the new law is going to solve the problem for the former country Yet in Prussia there is an efficient and reliable civil service and the private citizen moreover is accustomed to submit to a good deal of investiga tion of his affairs on the part of the public authorities All this renders the success of such a law more probable there than in America where indeed the attempts already made in certain States to secure correct returns of personal property by means of declarations have provel wholly ineffectual In grading the incomes the new law hans mnale the divisions much finer than before There are now 75 goades or classes for incomes from 8000 up to 120000 mlrks while under the law of 1873 there wCere only 27 and before that 19 Beyond this point the increment of increase in the nlew classification is 5000 marks while in the old it was for a fe w grades 24000 marks and finally mounted to 00000 As a result of this chane it is now necessary to ascertain the taxpayers income See Ely Taxation in American Stoaes and Cities p 146 et seq The fail urc of our personal Iaroperty tax is admitted by all who have been familiar with its worlintgs But whether in the event of the adoption of income taxes in our States a correct assessment would be much easier may be doubted We could hardly hope for better results than in Prussia220 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMHICS with an approach to accuracy which was not required before and would at any rate be impossible without the declarations Under the former classification the assessors even though they were required to avoid jedles litstige Eindbrigeng  might perhaps decide xvith some confidence that a mans income was for instance somewhere between 60000 and 712000 marks Any variation within these limits could be neglected since it did not affect the rate Under the new law how ever there are now seven classes within the same limits and it is necessary to decide hTetlher in the given case the income is between 60000 and 62000 mnarks or between 62000 and i64000 and so on thus imipplyingr a pretty exact knowl edge of the financial situation of the taxpayer such as could hardly be obtained without his cooperation Moreover when once the income is ascertained the new classificattion will have the effect of increasing the tax in most cases for the reason that under a classified income tax the amount by which any income exceeds the minimum limit of the class ill Awhich it is rated is practically untaxed The narrower the classes there fore the smaller these portions of untaxed income nmnstt bet Of especial importance are the changes whichl the law has made in the ratest Begrinning with the lowest class which includes incomes from 90011 to 1050 marks the ttax is 6 marks being equivalent to about 62 of 1 per cent of the mean income This rate increases until it reaches 3 per cent on an income of 10000 marks which it will be remembered was the uniform rate per cent of the formliler income tax In the ministerial hill the progression ceased at this point and thereafter the rate xvas uniformly 3 per cent of the mean in come in eatch classt Bat the Lower House of the Landtag was not content with this Unlike its predecessor of 184751 it was mnore radical than the government and in the bill as If illustration be needed take the case coiiSidered01 above antd we see that formerly ani inic lmie of 72000 mnarks was taxed nio more thani one of 60000 or strictly 60001 marks Here thenr were 12000 marks of income practically uin taxed Ulner the new classificatio the ntaxeti porntiin of aeny income at this part of the scale could not exceed 2000 marks See Appended Table p 226 t See  17 of law of 1891 0 The miniisteriall bill with the otfli ial rexjlanaition of its provisions is in the Finanz Archiev 1890 p 643THE PR USSIAN INCOMIFE TAX 221 finally passed the 3 per cent rate is retained only on incomes between 10000 and 30000 marks Then the progression begins again and continues until the rate reaches 4 per cent on anl income of 100000 marks Thereafter this remains the uni form rate per cent estimated on the minimum income of each class or in other words the tax increases 200 marks for every 5000 marks increase of incomne Speaking generally then the effect of the new law is to lower the tax on incomes under 10000 marks and increase it on higher incomes And even for incomes between 10000 and 30000 marks where the rate is nominally as before 3 per cent there is really an increase of taxation resulting first from the increase in the number of classes and secondly from the fact that the tax is now 3 per cent of the mean instead of the minimum income in each class To illustrate under the old law an income between 14100 and 16800 marks was

480 833 1650017500 510 There is here thenr a slight reduction in the tax on incomes between 14400 and 14 50t marks but above that point the tax is more than it was under the old classification See Appended Table p 226 In the assessment of small incomes the Prussian law has always favored the taxpayer by granting a partial or com plete abatement of his tax if he had to support a large family or contend with any special misfortunes or disadvantages such as serious cases of sickness accident fire floods or debt This  It must not be forgotten that these rates by no means give the full amount of the income tax The communal surtaxes must be added to the state tax and often have the effect of more than doubling the rates given above222 QUARTERLY JOURNYAL OF ECONOM21ICS was a feature of thle class tax Of I851 TEhe law of 1873 retained this feature and introduced it for the two lowest grades of the incomew tax as wellt so that all taxpayers whose incormies lid not exceed 4240 marks vere entitled to this special consideration although under the income tax the reduction could not be carried farther than to the next lower rate The law of 1891 ujves a still wcider application of this principle by permittingr a reduction of the tax to an extent not exceeding three grades on account of 1any special economic conditions whiiechi seriously impair the effi ciency Leistumgsftttigycit of the taxpav whose taxable income does not exceed 9500 miarks The exact nature of the special economic conditions is not more definitely described but presumably the intention is to include such eases as were explressly mentioned in previlus laws The ease of children in the family however is especially provided for and while the reduction is confinedl to tile icomnes under 3000 marks a return in this case to thle limit of 1851 it is not as before simply permitted Jut is required aid definitely regulated by law since for every dependent member of the family under fourteen years of age 50 marks mnust be leducted from the tax able income of the head of the famnilvIt This of itself would not in every case produce a redaction of the tax but the law further provides that if there are three or more such members in the family the tax itself must at all events be reduced by at least one grade One other new feature in tiPs law is the taxation of corpora tions and stock companies whieh must now pay the income tax on all dividends and net earnings abhove 3 per cent of the capital paid in The dividends are of course also included in the income of the stockholder and if he is a Prussian are taxed as such This results in the double taxation of the excess above 31 per cent but in this way and to this extent See VeranlagungsgrundsAtze  19 and 20 in Zeitschrift des preussischen statistischen Bureaus lid 8 1868 t Gesetz vom 25 Mai 1873  7 and 20 X See  18 19 of the law of 1891 An income of 950 marks will now be exempt from taxation if there is one child tnder the age of fourteen in the family an in come of 1000 marks if there are two such children and so onTHIE PR USSIAN INCOMTE TAX 223 the foreign stockholder is taxed once which seems to have been regardledl as a strongr ar gument in support of this provi siol rihe doublee txSation of the Prussian stockholder may perhaps be defended on the principle of the higher taxation of fundled incomes Whiclh as we have seen was a feature of the unsuccessful ta bill of 1847 but the provision appears to be simply a compromise between the desire to tax the foreiovn stockhdolder aml the opposition which might be made against taxing the Prussian stockholder twice on the full amount of his dividends Thuis the development of personal taxation in Prussia has resulted in the allltion of a partially progressive income tax The general tendency of eachl reform may be more clearly secil lellhaps if we indicate briefly the steps by which this result has been reached 1 A uniform poll tax 1811 2 A class tax collecting somewhat more from the prosper ous and not Less 1rom the poor 182021  o rpt supplement the clsess tax an income tax with compar atively few classes a uniform rate and a maximum limit 1851 41 Clssification made finer the maximum limit removed and the class tax made practically an income tax with a pro gressive rate and the exemption of incomes up to 420 marks 188 5 Exemnption of incomes up to 900 marks reduction of the remnainiing rates of the class tax and of the two lowest rates of the income tax 1 88183 6 The prineile of progression extended to all incomes under 100000 minarks incomes under 10000 marks taxed less than before and higherl incomes more a declaration of in come by the taxpayer requirel and a finer classification adoopted 189t Iin connection with this resume it may be well to note that such progression as existed in the rates on small incomes previous to this latest reform was probably not a true recog nition of the progressive principle of taxation but simply a reduction of the regular rate made in view of the fact that the indirect taxes collect proportionally more from the smaller incomes than froin the larger so that when we consider the24 QllUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS tax system as a whole the aim was not progressive but simply proportional taxation Such a reduction from the normal or uniform rate German writers designate as degressive taxation In the new law however the progressive principle finds a dis tinct although partial application since in collecting 4 per cent from incomes of 100000 marks or more and only 3 per cent or less from incomes under 30000 marks it is manifestly the intention that the rich shall contribute not simply more proportionally than the poor but also more than men of mod erate means Strictly considered then this is not an exten sion of the progressive principle but its introduction In this and other respects the latest reforms show clearly the influence of those principles of taxation which have been ably advocated by Professor Wagner and from a somewhat different standpoint by other leading political economists of Germany These principles seem to be growing in popular favor and likely to exert an increasing influence on future legislation The watchword of the German school of econo mists ZBesteuerung nach Leistungsfdhigkeit may be regarded as a translation of Adam Smiths wellknown phrase taxation according to the respective abilities of the subjects of the state a true Bunsbyan principle however of which the bearing lies wholly in the application As interpreted by Watgner and his followers it demands the exemption from direct taxation at least of the existence minimum or the small incomes which are orally sufficient for the necessaries of life the progressive taxation of other incomes and higher rates on the earnings of land and capital than on those of labor This last principle is not openly recognized in the new law but it is practically fulfilled in Prussia by coexisting sep arate taxes on laud buildings and industries as well as by the tax on corporations already referred to t Without attempting to predict what the next reforms will be we may safely say that the income tax is destined to play a still more important It may be noted that in the communal surtaxes the progression has often been carried niuch farther and made much sharper than in the state tax See Neumann Einkommensteuer p 112 et seq f Eine Mehrbelastung des fundierten Einkommens  was one object of the proposed inheritance tax a feature of the government programme which the Landtag rejectedTHE PRUSSIAN INCOME TAX 225 role in state taxation for the finance minister in explaining the government programme has assured the Lindtag that as soon as possible and in so far as the expected increase of revenue from the income tax permits land and buildings shall cease to be taxed by the state and be reserved as objects of local taxation only Indeed the new law contains express pro visions which have this end in view This is a reform which has long been demanded and is not yet so near at hand per haps as the assurances of the finance minister would seem to indicate When it comes it will be another step in the direc tiorn of that division of the sources of imperial state and local revenues  advocated by Gneist and others  which would assign taxes on consumption to the empire direct personal taxes to the states and taxes on real property to the communes JOSEPH A HILL  It is provided that the receipt from the income tax above a certain limit  80000000 marks for the year 189293 with an increase of 4 per cent for each subse quent yearshall be applied to the above purpose If however that is not lone the rates of the income tax must be reduced until the receipts come within the designated limit See  8284 This last provision was doubtless inserted to assure the Landtag that the government was not covertly aiming at an increase of taxation since the limit is not above what the estimated receipts of the old class and income tax would have been for the next two or three years226 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS TABLE SHOWING THE TAXES IMPOSED ON INCOMIES FROM 3000 UP TO 105000 MARKS BY THE LAWS OF

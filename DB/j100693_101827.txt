THERE SEVERAL PHATS OF HIS OWN SIR HAVING HERETOFORE SEEN IN SOME OF THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SO CIETYQUERIES CONCERNING THE SALTSPRINGS IN CHESHIREAND NOT HEAR ING OF ANY ACCOUNT HATH BEEN GIVEN THEM OF OURS IN WORCESTERSHIRE WHICH I HOPED SOME MORE INGENUOUS PEN WOULD HAVE DONE BEFORE THIS TIME TO SATISFIE THE DESIRE OF SOME FRIEND I HAVE MADE AS EXACT TRI ALLS OF OUR BRINE AS I COULD THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE IN SOME MEASURE TO GIVE AN ANSWER TO THE CHESHIRE QUERIES WHICH IF THEY ARE NOT ANSWER 6 Z ED1060 ED SO FULLY AS EXPECTED IN WHAT I AM DEFICIENT IF I MAY KNOW I SHALL BE READY TO GIVE AN ANSWER IN THE MEAN TIME I HOPE MY ENDEAVOURS WILL BE ACCEPTED AND I PARDONED QUER I WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY IT IS WHERE THE SPRINGS ARE AND WHAT PLACES GROW ABOUT THEM ANSW THE COUNTRY IS NEITHER PLAIN NEITHER HATH IT ANY GREAT HILLS BUT MANY SMALL RISINGS THE GREATEST HILLS NEAR US BEING THE LICHIE WITHIN SIX MILES WHICH SOME CALL LOOK HIGH SUPPOSING IT TO BE THE HIGHEST GROUND IN THESE PARTS BECAUSE THE SPRINGS THAT RISE THERE RUN INTO THE NORTH AND SOUTH SEAS NEAR TO WHICH ARE CLENT HILLS ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE ON THE OTHER SIDE THE RIVER SEVERN ARE ABERLY HILLS AT ABOUT SEVEN MILES DI STANCE FROM US THERE ARE MANY SALT SPRINGS ABOUT THE TOWN WHICH IS SEATED BY A BROOKSIDE CALLED SALWARPBROOK WHICH ARISE BOTH IN THE BROOK AND IN THE GROUND NEAR IT THOUGH THERE ARE BUT THREE PITS THAT ARE MADE USE OF FOR THE PLANTS GROWING ABOUT THE SPRINGS I FIND NO OTHER VARIETIES THEN IN OTHER PLACES BUT WHERE THE SPRINGS ARE SALTEST THERE GROWS NO THING AT ALL BUT BY THE BRACKISH DITCHES THERE GROWS ASTER ATTICUS WITH A PALE FLOWER WHICH I FIND NO WHERE ELSE WITH US QUER 2 WHAT IS THE DEPTH OF THE SALT SPRINGS ANSTHE DEPTH OF THEM IS VARIOUS SOME RISE ON THE TOP OF THE GROUND WHICH ARE NOT SO SALT AS OTHERS THOSE THAT ARE IN THE PITS WE MAKE USE OF ARE VARIOUS ALSO THE GREAT PIT WHICH IS CALLED UPWICH PIT IS 30 FOOT DEEP IN WHICH ARE THREE DISTINCT SPRINGS RISING IN THE BOTTOM ONE COMES INTO THE PIT NORTHWEST ANOTHER NORTHEAST THE THIRD SOUTHEAST WHICH IS THE RICHEST BOTH IN QUANTITY AND QUALITYTHEY ALL DIFFER IN SALTNESS WHICH I CAN GIVE NO EXACT ACCOUNT OF IT BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THEM BUT THERE WILL BE SOME MIXTURE THE PIT IS ABOUT 10 FOOT SQUARE THE SIDES ARE MADE WITH SQUARE ELMS JOYNTED IN AT THE FULL LENGTH WHICH I SUPPOSE IS OCCASIONED BY THE SALTNESS OF THE GROUND WHICH APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE BEEN A BOG THE SURFACE OF IT IS MADE OF ASHES THAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY A BOG I AM INDUCED TO BELIEVE FOR NOT MANY YEARS SINCE DIGGING TO TRY THE FOUNDATION OF A SEAL FOR SO WE CALL OUR HOUSES WE MAKE SALT IN I THRUST A LONG STAFF OVER HEAD QUER3 WHETHER THERE ARE ANY HOT SPRINGS NEARAND WHETHER THE WA TERS OF THE SALT SPRINGS BE COLDER THEN OTHER WATER ANSW THERE ARE NO HOT SPRINGS NEAR US FOR THE COLDNESS OF THE BRINE IT IS GENERALLY COLDER THAN OTHER WATER YET IT NEVER FREEZETH BUT THE RAIN WATER THAT LYES UPON THE BRINE IN EXTREAM HARD FROSTS WILL FREEZ BUT NOT MUCH QUER4 WHAT KIND OF EARTH IT IS AND IN DIGGING WHETHER THERE ARE ANY SHELLS ANSWFOR SHELLS I NEVER OBSERVED NOR HEARD OF ANY FOR THE NATURE OF THE SOIL ABOUT THE TOWN ON THE LOWER SIDE IT IS A BLACK RICH EARTH UNDER WHICH1061 WHICH TWO OR THREE FOOT IS A STIFF GRAVELLY CLAY THEN MARLE THOSE THAT MAKE WELLS FOR FRESH WATER IF THEY FIND SPRINGS IN THE MARLE THEY ARE GENERALLY FRESH BUT IF THEY SINK THROUGH THE MARLE THEY COME TO A WHITISH CLAY MIXED WITH GRAVEL IN WHICH THE SPRINGS ARE MORE OR LESS BRACKISH QUER5HOW STRONG THE WATER IS OF SALT AND WHAT QUANTITY OF BRINE THE PITS YIELD ANSW IN THE GREAT PIT AT UPWICH WE HAVE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME THREE SORTS OF BRINE WHICH WE CALL BY THE NAMES OF FIRSTMAN MIDDLE MAN AND LASTMAN THESE SORTS ARE OF DIFFERENT STRENGTHS THE BRINE IS DRAWN BY PUMP FOR THAT WHICH IS IN THE BOTTOM IS FIRST PUMPED OUT WHICH IS THAT WE CALL FIRST MAN C THAT I MIGHT MAKE AN EXACT TRIAL OF THE STRENGTH I MADE ME A QUART THAT CONTAINED 24 OUNCES TROY OF DISTILLED WATER WHICH QUART BEING FILLED WITH THE FIRST BRINE BESIDES THE TARE OF THE QUART WEIGHED 29 OUNCES WHICH MADE 7 OUNCES AND 3 DRACHMS OF SALT WITHOUT ANY ADDITION THE NEXT DAY I WEIGHED THE SAME SALT AGAINAND IT WEIGHED 7OUNCES AND 6 DRACHMS BY WHICH IT AP PEARS THIS BRINE YIELDS ABOVE A FOURTH PART SALT SO THAT 4 TUNS OF BRINE MAKE ABOVE ONE TUN OF SALT THE SAME QUART FILLED WITH MIDDLEMAN WHICH IS THE SECOND SORT OF BRINE WEIGHED 28 OUNCES I ALSO WEIGHED A QUART OF BRINE AS IT CAME IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE SPRINGS WHICH WEIGH ED 28 OUNCES AND THE THIRD SORT 27 OUNCES SO THAT WHAT THE FIRST GETS THE LAST LOOSETH WHICH DOTH PRECIPITATE AS MUCH IN 24 HOURS AS IF IT STOOD MUCH LONGER TIME THE QUANTITY OF BRINE THAT THIS PIT YIELDS EVERY 24 HOURS IS AS MUCH AS WILL MAKE 450 BUSHELS OF SALT WHICH IS DRAWN OUT TWICE OR THREE TIMES A DAY FOR SO OFT WE ORDINARILY DRAW AND THAT AS LONG AS THE PUMP WILL GOE IN THE BEST PIT AT NETHERWICH A QUART OF BRINE WEIGHS 28 OUNCES AND A HALF THIS PIT IS 18 FOOT DEEP AND FOUR FOOT BROAD AND YIELDS AS MUCH BRINE EVERY 24 HOURS AS MAKES ABOUT 40 BUSHELS OF SALT THERE IS BUT ONE SPRING IN THE PIT THAT COMES IN 2 FOOT AND 8 INCHES ABOVE THE BOTTOM THE WORST PIT AT NETHERWICH IS OF THE SAME BREADTH AND DEPTH AS THE FORMER A QUART OF BRINE OUT OF WHICH WEIGHETH 27 OUNCES AND YIELDS AS MUCH BRINE DAYLY AS MAKES ABOUT 30 BUSHELS OF SALT IN THIS PIT ARE THREE SPRINGS TWO IN THE BOTTOM AND ONE ABOUT TWO FOOT HIGHER THESE PITS ARE WITHIN SIX YARDS ONE OF ANOTHER THESE PITS ARE NEAR THE BROOK THE GREAT PIT ON THE NORTH SIDE AND A BOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE LOWER THE TWO LESSER PITS ON THE SOUTH SIDE QUER 6 WHETHER THE SPRINGS YIELD MORE OR LESS BRINE AT ONE TIME THAN AT ANOTHER ANSW IN THE GREAT PIT I FIND LITTLE OR NO VARIATION EITHER IN QUALITY OR STRENGTH OF THE BRINE BUT THE SPRINGS IN THE OTHER PITS ARE AUGMENTED BY MUCH RAIN AND YIELD LESS SALT 6 Z 2 ANSW1062 QUER7 WHAT IS THE MANNER OF THEIR WORK WHETHER THERE IS ANY THING USED TO MAKE THE SALT GRANULATE AND WHAT IT IS ANSW FOR THE MANNER OF OUR WORK THAT EVERY MAN MAY KNOW HIS OWN PROPORTIONTHE BRINE IS DIVIDED INTO PHATS WALLINGSA PHAT WALLING IS DIVIDED INTO 12 WEAKER BRINES AND EVERY WEAKER BRINE IS DIVIDED INTO 8 BURDENS EVERY BURDEN BEING A VESSEL THAT CONTAINS ABOUT 32 GALLONS WHEREOF EVERY ONE HATH 6 BURDEN OF FIRSTMAN 6 OF MIDDLE MAN AND 6 OF LASTMANSO THAT EVERY MAN HATH NOT ONLY HIS JUST PRO PORTION IN QUANTITY BUT IN QUALITY ALSO THIS BRINE IS CARRIED IN COO LERS TO EVERY MANS SEAL BY 8 SWORN MEN WHICH WE CALL MASTERS OF THE BEACHIN AND 4 MIDDLEMEN AND THERE PUT INTO GREAT TUNS FOR USE THE FUEL WHICH WAS HERETOFORE USED WAS ALL WOOD WHICH SINCE THE IRONWORKSIS SO DESTROYED THAT ALL THE WOOD AT ANY REASONABLE DISTANCE WILL NOT SUPPLY THE WORKS ONE QUARTER OF THE YEAR SO THAT NOW WE USE ALMOST ALL PITCOALS WHICH ARE BROUGHT TO US BY LAND 13 OR 14 MILES FOR THE PHATS WE BOIL OUR BRINE IN THEY ARE MADE OF LEAD CAST INTO A FLAT PLATE 5 FOOT AND A HALF LONG AND 3 FOOT OVER AND THEN THE SIDES AND ENDS BEATEN UPAND A LITTLE RAISD IN THE MIDDLE WHICH ARE SET UPON BRICK WORK WHICH WE CALL OVENS IN WHICH IS A GRATE TO MAKE THE FIRE ONAND AN ASHHOLE WHICH WE CALL A TRUNK IN SOME SEALS ARE  OF THESE PANS IN SOME 5 SOME 4 SOME 3 SOME 2 IN EACH OF THESE PANS IS BOILD AT A TIME AS MUCH BRINE AS MAKES 3 PECKS OF WHITE SALT WHICH WE CALL A LADE AND IS LADED OUT OF THE PAN WITH A LOOTE WHICH IS A PANNEL BOARD PUT SLOPEWAYS ON A STAFF ABOUT 3 FOOT LONG AND PUT INTO BARROWS WHICH ARE SET IN BASTALLS OVER VESSELS WE CALL LEACHCOMS THAT THE BRINE MAY RUN FROM THE SALT WHICH BRINE WE CALL LEACH WITH WHICH WE DRESS OUR PHATS WHEN THE COLD BRINE THEY FIRST FILLED WITH IS SOMETHING BOILD A WAY IN THESE BASTALLS THE SALT STANDS TILL IT IS DRY WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR HOURS THEN WE CARRY IT INTO CRIBS WHICH ARE HOUSES BOARDED IN THE BOTTOM AND SIDES WHERE IT IS KEPT TILL SOLD WHICH IS SOMETIMES HALF A YEAR OR 3 QUARTERS IN WHICH TIME IF THE CRIB IS GOOD IT WILL NOT WASTE A TWELFTH PART THE SALT IT SELF BEING OF SO STRONG A BODY WHEREAS IN CHE SHIRE THEY ARE FORCED TO KEEP THEIR SALT IN BARROWS IN STOVES TO DRY IT AND MAKE IT NO FASTER THEN THEY SELL FOR CLARIFYING OUR SALT WE SHOULD HAVE LITTLE NEED WERE IT NOT FOR DUST ACCIDENTALLY FALLING INTO THE BRINE THE BRINE OF IT SELF BEING SO CLEAR THAT NOTHING CAN BE CLEARER  FOR CLARIFYING IT WE USE NOTHING BUT THE WHITES OF EGGS OF WHICH WE TAKE A QUARTER OF A WHITE AND PUT IT INTO A GALLON OR TWO OF BRINE WHICH BEING BEATEN WITH ONES HAND LATHARS AS IF IT WERE SOAP A SMALL QUANTITY OF WHICH FROTH PUT INTO EACH PHAT RAISETH ALL THE SCUM SO THAT THE WHITE OF ONE EGG WILL CLARIFIE 20  OF SALT BY WHICH MEANS OUR SALT IS AS WHITE  ANY THING CAN BE NEI THER1063 THER HATH IT ANY ILL FAVOUR AS THAT SALT HATH THAT IS CLARIFIED WITH  FOR GRANULATING IT WE USE NOTHING AT ALL FOR THE BRINE IS SO  OF IT SELF THAT UNLESS IT BE OFTEN STIRRED IT WILL MAKE SALT AS BIG GRAINED AS BAY SALT I HAVE BOYLD BRINE TO A CANDY HIGHT AND IT HATH PRODUCED CLODS OF SALT AS CLEAR AS THE CLEAREST ALUM LIKE  OF MAY SALT SO THAT WE ARE NECESSITATED TO PUT A SMALL QUANTITY OF ROSIN INTO THE BRINE TO MAKE THE GRAIN OF THE SALT SMALL QUER 8 WHAT ARE THE SEVERAL SORTS OF SALT ANSW BESIDES THE WHITE SALT I HAVE SPOKE OF WE HAVE ANOTHER SORT WHICH WE CALL CLODSALT WHICH GROWS TO THE BOTTOMS OF THE PHATS THAT AFTER THE WHITE SALT IS LADED OUT IS DIGGED UP WITH A PICKER WHICH IS MADE LIKE A MASONS TROWELPOINTED WITH STEEL AND PUT UPON A SHORT STAFF THIS IS THE STRONGEST SALT I HAVE SEEN AND IS MOST USED FOR SALTING BACON AND NEATS TONGUES IT MAKES THE BACON REDDER THAN OTHER SALT AND MAKES THE FAT EAT FIRM IF THE SWINE ARE  WITH MAST IT HARDENS THE FAT ALMOST AS MUCH AS IF FED WITH PEASE AND SALTED WITH WHITE SALT IT IS VERY MUCH USED BY COUNTREY WOMEN TO PUT INTO THEIR RUNNETPOTS ANDAS THEY SAYIS BETTER FOR THEIR  THESE CLODS ARE USED TO BROIL MEAT WITH BEING LAID ON COALS WE ACCOUNT THIS SALT TO BE TOO STRONG TO SALT BEEF WITH IT TAKING AWAY TOO MUCH OF ITS SWEETNESS A THIRD SORT OF SALT WE HAVE WHICH WE CALL KNOCKINGS WHICH DOTH CANDY ON THE STAILES OF THE BARROW AS THE BRINE RUNS FROM THE SALT AFTER IT IS LADED OUT OF THE PHATS THIS SALT IS MOST USED FOR THE SAME USES AS THE CLOD SALT THOUGH IT IS NOT ALTOGETHER SO STRONG A FOURTH SORT WE HAVE WHICH WE CALL SCRAPINGS THAT IS A COURSE SORT OF SALT THAT IS MIXED WITH DROSS AND DUST THAT CLEAVES TO THE TOPS OF THE SIDES OF THE PHATS THIS SALT IS SCRAPED OFF THE PHATS WHEN WE REACH THEM THAT IS WHEN WE TAKE OUR PHATS OFF THE FIRES TO BEAT UP THE BOTTOM AND IS BOUGHT BY THE POOR SORT OF PEOPLE TO SALT MEAT WITH A  SORT IS PIGEON SALT WHICH IS NOTHING BUT THE BRINE RUNNING OUT THROUGH THE CRACK OF A PHAT AND HARDENS TO A CLOD ON THE OUTSIDE OVER THE FIRE LASTLY THE SALT LOAVES ARE THE FINEST OF THE WHITE SALT THE GRAIN OF WHICH IS MADE SOMETHING FINER THEN ORDINARY THAT IT MAY THE BETTER AD HERE TOGETHER WHICH IS DONE BY ADDING A LITTLE MORE ROSIN AND IS BEATEN INTO THE BARROWS WHEN IT IS LADED OUT OF THE PHAT QUER 9 WHETHER OUR SALT BE MORE OR LESS APT TO DISSOLVE IN THE AIR THAN OTHER SALT ANSW IT IS NOT SO APT TO DISSOLVEAS CHESHIRE SALTNOR AS THAT SALT THAT IS MADE BY DISSOLVING BAYSALT AND CLARIFYING IT WHICH IS CALLED SALT UPON SALT WHICH APPEARS BY OUR LONG KEEPING IT WITHOUT ANY FIRE WHETHER IT WILL KEEP BETTER THAN FRENCH SALT I HAVE MADE NO TRIAL BUT I SUPPOSE IT WILLFOR SUCH REASONS I SHALL GIVE IN ANSWER AS TO THE GOODNESS OF OUR SALT QUER1064 QUER 10 WHETHER OUR SALT BE AS GOOD TO POWDER BEEF OR OTHER FLESH AS FRENCH SALT ANSW IT IS AND I BELIEVE THERE CANNOT BE BETTER WHITE SALT THEN OURS FOR SEVERAL REASONS 1 THERE IS NONE CAN BE WHITERAND CONSEQUENTLY MORE FREE FROM DROSS 2 IT IS THE WEIGHTIEST AS I HAVE SEEN MY SELF AND BEEN INFORMED BY O THERSFOR THE BAGGS OF SALT I HAVE USUALLY SEEN BROUGHT OUT OF CHESHIRE ON HORSEBACK CONTAIN 6 BUSHELS AND A HALF OR 7 BUSHELS WHEREAS THE BEST HORSES THAT CARRY SALT FROM HENCE IF THEY CARRY IT ABOVE 5 MILES CARRY NOT ABOVE 3STRIKE AND 3 PECKSOR 4 STRIKE A WINCHESTER BUSHEL OF OUR SALT WEIGHS HALF A HUNDRED WEIGHT SO THAT IT MUST NECESSARILY FOLLOW THE WEIGHTYEST AND DRIEST MUST NEEDS BE THE BEST 3IN THE TIME OF THE FIRST DUTCHWARROUR SALT WAS CARRIED DOWN INTO THE WEST WHERE THEY HAD BEFORE NONE BUT FORREIGN SALT WHERE AT THE FIRST USING OURS THEY COMPLAINED THAT IT MADE THEIR MEAT TOO SALT WHICH WAS BECAUSE THEY PUT AS MUCH OF OURS ON THEIRMEAT AS OF OTHERS IF SO IT MUST BE BETTER THEN FRENCH SALT THIS ACCOUNT I HAD FROM HIM HAT CARRIED OUR SALT INTO THOSE PARTS T 4 I HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY MANY THAT HAVE MADE USE BOTH OF OURS AND CHESHIRE SALT THAT BOTH FOR FLESH AND WHITEMEAT THEY MUST LAY ON MORE OF CHESHIRE SALT THEN OURS 5 IT DOTH PRESERVE ALL SORTS OF FLESH FOR LONG VOYAGESVIZ TO JAMAI CA AS WELL AS ANY WHICH HATH BEEN LATELY TRIED 6 I HAVE SEEN HERRINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SALTED WITH OUR SALT IN IRELAND AND BROUGHT OVER TO THIS TOWNWHICH HAVE BEEN WHITER AND BETTER TAST ED THAN THOSE SALTED WITH BAY SALT 7 IT IS AN ORDINARY WAY OF POWDERING BEEF WITH US TO GIVE IT BUT ONE SALTING TO KEEP IT THE WHOLE YEAR IF IT IS ASKED WHY WE USE NOT IRONPANS AS IN CHESHIRE AND OTHER PLACES THERE HAVE BEEN TRYALS MADE BOTH OF FORGED IRONPANS AND CASTIRON THE FORMER THE STRENGTH OF THE BRINE DOTH SO CORRODE THAT IT QUICKLY WEARS THEM OUT THE LATTER THE BRINE BREAKS SIR IF THERE IS ANY THING MORE OF WHICH YOU DESIRE AN INFORMATION I SHALL IF I MAY KNOW IT INDEAVOUR TO INFORM YOU THAT AM DROYTWITCH MARCH YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT THE 16TH 1678 THO RASTEL THE

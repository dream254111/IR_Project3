AND ENGLISH CHANNELS AND THE IM PORTANCE OF EXTENDING THE EXPERIMENTS ROUND THE LANDS END AND UP THE ENGLISH CHANNEL EMBODIED IN A LETTER TO THE LHYDROGRAPHER BY CAPTAIN F W BEECHEY RN FRS COMMUNICATED BY G B AIRY ESQ FRS SC ASTRONOMER ROYAL RECEIVED MARCH 22READ MARCH 29 1848 SIR LONDON FEBRUARY 19TH 1848 IT IS WITH MUCH PLEASURE I LAY BEFORE YOU THE RESULT OF OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE UPON THE TIDES IN THE IRISH SEA DURING THE EXECUTION OF THE SURVEY WHICH HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO MY CHARGE UP TO THE PERIOD OFT THESE OBSERVATIONS THE SET OF THE TIDES IN THE IRISH SEA HAD THE STREAM BEEN GREATLY MISUNDERSTOOD OWING TO THE ASSOCIATION OF THE TURN OF THE STREAM WITH ICNTHNELRISH THE RISE AND FALL OF THE WATER ON THE SHORE AND IT WAS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT AS HITHERTO MIS HOLYHEAD WAS THREE HOURS LATER IN ITS TIDES THAN PLACES AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CHANNEL A VESSEL STARTING WITH THE FIRST OF THE FLOOD WOULD CARRY NINE HOURS TIDE IN HER FAVOUR IN HER RUN UP CHANNEL AND VICE VERSA THIS WAS AN ERROR SUFFICIENTLY GREAT IN ITSELF BUT IT WAS LIABLE TO BE INCREASED BY AN ENTIRE IGNORANCE AS TO THE TIME WHEN A VESSEL WOULD TAKE ANY PARTICULAR TIDE FOR THE TIMES OF HIGH WATER BY THE SHORE WERE VERY VARIOUS ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE CHANNEL THE PRESENT INQUIRY I AM HAPPY TO INFORM YOU HAS SET THESE ERRORS AND DOUBTS AT REST THE OBSERVATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VARIETY OF TITNES OF HIGH WATER THROUGHOUT THE CHANNEL THE TURN OF THE STREAM IS SIMULTANEOUS THAT THE TURN OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAMS IN BOTH CHANNELS COMMENCE AND END IN ALL PARTS STREAM NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SIMULTANEOUS PRACTICALLY SPEAKING AT THE SAME TIME AND THAT TIME HAPPENS TO CORRESPOND WITH THROUGHOUT THE TIME OF HIGH AND LOW WATER ON THE SHORE AT MORECOMBE BAY AN ESTUARY RENDERED NORTH REMARKABLE AS BEING THE POINT WHERE THE OPPOSITE TIDES COMING ROUND THE EXTREMITIES CHANNELS OF IRELAND FINALLY MEET SO THAT IT IS NECESSARY ONLY TO KNOW THE TIMES OF HIGH AND MEETING OF LOW WATER AT MORECOMBE BAY TO DETERMINE THE HOUR WHEN THE STREAM OF EITHER TIDE TIDES WILL COMMENCE OR TERMINATE A FACT WHICH WILL I AM SURE BE FULLY APPRECIATED BY EVERY PERSON NAVIGATING THE IRISH CHANNEL AT NIGHT OR IN THICK WEATHER THE CHART OF CURVES OR LINES OF DIRECTION OF THE STREAM PLATE II WHICH ACCOMPA INIES THIS REPORT WILL SHOW AT ONCE THE EFFECT OF THE TIDE UPON A VESSEL WHEREVER SHE MNAY BE PLACED IN THE CHANNEL AND ESPECIALLY DIRECT HER WHERE WITH A BEATING WIND MVCCCXLVIIT P106 CAPTAIN F W BEECHEY ON THE TIDES IN SHE WILL BE BENEFITED BY STANDING IN SHORE OR OTHERWISE AND WILL WARN HER OF THE DANGER OF DRAWING NEAR THE SHORES OF CARDIGAN OR CAERNARVON BAYS WITH PARTICULAR TIDES AND SCANT WINDS AND SO LIKEWISE OF THE DANGER OF STANDING CLOSE TO THE BANKS SKIRTING THE IRISH COAST IN LIGHT WINDS BUT IT IS NOT TO THE NAVIGATOR ALONE THAT THESE OBSERVATIONS WILL I HOPE BE FOUND USEFUL THEY WILL I THINK BE INTERESTING TO MEN OF SCIENCE TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE VERY VALUABLE SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS WHICH WERE CARRIED ROUND IRELAND BY THE ORDNANCE AT THE SUGGESTION OF PROFESSOR AIRY WE ARE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH PECULIAR SEVERAL CURIOUS FACTS FIRST THAT WHILST IT IS HIGH WATER AT ONE END OF THE CHANNEL IT FEATURE OF THE IS LOW WATER AT THE OTHER THAT THE SAME STREAM MAKES BOTH HIGH AND LOW WATER AT TIDES THE SAME TIME THAT THERE ARE TWO SPOTS IN THE CHANNEL IN ONE OF WHICH THE STREAM RUNS WITH CONSIDERABLE VELOCITY WITHOUT THE WATER EITHER RISING OR FALLING AND IN THE OTHER THAT THE WATER RISES AND FALLS FIOM SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FEET WITHOUT HAVING ANY VISIBLE HORIZONTAL MOTION OF ITS SURFACE AND THAT DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE FLOWING AND LAST HALF OF THE EBBING TIDEWAVE THE STREAM IN THE SOUTH CHANNEL RUNS IN A CONTRARY DIRECTION TO THE WAVE AND GOES UP AN ASCENT OF ABOUT ONE FOOT IN 42 MILES SEE PLATE IV TRO THE LINES OF DIRECTION OF THE STREAM I HAVE ADDED THE RATE OF THE TIDE AT ITS GREATEST VELOCITY ON THE DAY OF SYZYGY AND HAVE REDUCED ALL TO THE SAME STANDARD I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO DESCRIBE THE GENERAL COURSE OF THE STREAMS THROUGHOUT THE CHANNEL POINT OUT THE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE MEETING OF THE TIDES OCCURS AND OFFER SUCH REMARKS ON THE COURSE OF THE STREAM AND UPON THE TIDAL PHENO MENA OF THIS SEA AS WILL I CONCEIVE BENEFIT THE NAVIGATOR AND BE INTERESTING TO SCIENCE AN INSPECTION OF THE CHART PLATE II WILL SHOW THAT THE TIDE ENTERS THE IRISH SEA BY TWO CHANNELS OF WHICH CARNSORE POINT AND PEMBROKE ARE THE LIMITS OF THE SOUTHERN ONE AND RATHLIN AND THE MULL OF KINTIRE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE NORTHERN THE STREAM IN THE SOUTHERN CHANNEL AS BEFORE STATED HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED TO MOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ONE VAST CURRENT THROUGHOUT RUNNING SIX HOURS NEARLY EACH WAY AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF FROM TWO TO THREE KNOTS PER HOUR AT THE HEIGHT OF THE SPRINGS INCREASING TO FOUR KNOTS AND UPWARDS NEAR THE BANKS AND AT THE PITCH OF TIRNES OF THE HEADLANDS ITS TIMES OF SLACK WATER CORRESPONDING SUFFICIENTLY NEAR FOR ALL PRAC SLACK WATER TICAL PURPOSES WITH THE TIMES OF HIGH AND LOW WATERJOR THE DAY AT MORECOMBE BAY OR THROUGHOUTOFBY THE CHANNEL MORE CORRECTLY AT FLEETWOOD WHICH IS TWELVE MINUTES EARLIER

FIND THEM REPRESENTED IN THE ANNEXED CHART PLATE II BUT HALFTIDE BESIDES THESE THERE ARE AS USUAL AT ALL THE POINTS AND HEADLANDS WHEN ABRUPT EDDIES COUNTER STREAMS OR EDDIES BEGINNING AT ABOUT TWO HOURS AFTER THE OFFING STREAMN INCREASING WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE TIDE AND OCCASIONING RACES AND OVERFALLS AT THE PLACES MARKED ON THE CHART IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OFFING STREAM THERE IS AS LITTLE VARIATION OF THE CURRENT AT THE DIFFERENT HOURS OF TIDE AS WILL BE INET WITH IN ANY SEA OF SIMILAR EXTENT AND INDEED IT IS ONLY WITH THE SLACKENING OF THE TIDE THAT THE VARIA TIONS OCCUR SO THAT BY A DUE ATTENTION TO THE LINES I HAVE GIVEN THE NAVIGATION MAY BE AS CERTAINLY CONDUCTED HERE AS IN ANY CHANNEL WITH WHICH WE ARE ACQUAINTED DURING THE TIME THESE OBSERVATIONS ON THE STREAM WERE IN PROGRESS OTHERS WERE MADE UPON THE RISE AND FALL OF THE WATER AT SEVERAL STATIONS IN THE CHANNEL AND WHEREVER PRACTICABLE AT PLACES IN THE OFFING BY COMBINING THESE OBSERVATIONS WITH THE RANGE OF TIDE ON THE COAST OF IRELAND PUBLISHED IN PROFESSOR WHEWELLS ADMIRABLE PAPER ON THE TIDES IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1836 PART II AND WITH OBSERVATIONS MADE BY CAPTAINS ROBINSON DENHAM FRAZER SHERRINGHAM WIL LIAMS C I HAVE CONSTRUCTED A CHART OF LINES OF EQUAL RANGE OF TIDE PLATE III IN CHARTOFLINES ORDER THAT THE SEAMAN MAY ASCERTAIN BY A SIMPLE INSPECTION OF THE CHART WHEREVER HE OF EQUAL MAY BE PLACED IN THE CHANNEL THE AMOUNT OF SPRING RANGE TO WHICH HE HAS TO ADAPT G HIS SOUNDINGS IN THIS CHART THE LINES DENOTE THE RANGE OF TIDE AT THE PLACES OVER WHICH THEY PASS ON A DAY WHEN

ACCORDING TO THE KNOWN DIFFERENCE OF RANGE BETWEEN THE PLACES IN THE SEA TO THE NORTHWARD OF HLOLYHEAD THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN COMPILED FROM OBSERVATIONS MADE ON CALIN DAYS AT ANCHOR IN CONNECTION WITH

AT ONE STAGE OF THE TIDE THE DIFFERENCE OF SIMILAR TIDAL INTERVALS AMOUNTS TO ABOUT FOUR FEET I MAY HERE MENTION THAT THE CUMBERLAND BASIN GAUGE MR BUNTS WHICH HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO IN THE

OF PLATE IX AND X UPON WHICH I HAVE TRACED THE COURSE OF THE STREAM AT ALTERNATE HOURS THE CHANNEL OF A SPRING TIDE EACH LINE REPRESENTING THE DIRECTION OF THE STREAM AT THE SAME MOMENT COURSES OF THROUGHOUT BOTH CHANNELS FROM THE CONNECTION OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE IRISH SEA TEREMAT WITH THOSE OF THE BRISTOL CHANNEL IT IS CLEAR THAT THE WHOLE OF THE EBB OR OUTGOING HOURS OF THE STREAM OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE IRISH CHANNEL RUNS INTO THE BRISTOL CHANNEL AND DUNGENESS FORMS THE FLOOD OR INGOING TIDE OF THE NORTHERN HALF OF THAT GREAT ESTUARY AND VICE TO THE IRISH SEA VERSA THE EBB OR OUTGOING STREAM FROM THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE BRISTOL CHANNEL TIDES OF THE FORMS THE FLOOD OF THE IRISH SEA EACH TIDE PASSING TO AND FRO WITH GREAT RAPIDITY BRISTOL ROUND ST GOVANS HEAD THE CENTRE AND SOUTHERN HALF OF THE BRISTOL CHANNEL CHANNEL RECEIVE THEIR WATERS FROM THE OFFING AND THE ENGLISH CHANNEL THE COAST STREAM BRING ING THE WATERS UP FROM THE LANDS END AND THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AS THE STREAM ON THE NORTHERN HALF DID THOSE OF THE IRISH CHANNEL AND VICE VERSA THE GREAT OFFING STREARN AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL EXTENDS ITS INFLUENCE EFFECT OF THE AS FAR UP AS CAPE LA HAGUE BEYOND WHICHOWING PERHAPS TO THE SUDDEN CONTRACTION OFFING STREAM WHICH THERE OCCURS IN THE CHANNEL THE STREAM SUFFERS NO INTERRUPTION BUT AS IN THE TIDE IN THE IRISH SEA PASSES UP AND DOWN THE CHANNEL SIX HOURS NEARLY EACH WAY AS FAR AS A ENGLISH CHANNEL LINE JOINING DUNGENESS AND CAPE GRISNEZ THE APPARENT VIRTUAL HEAD OF THE TIDAL CHANNEL HERE THE INFLUENCE OF THE NORTH SEA STREAM BEGINS TO BE FELT AND HERE AS IN THE IRISH CHANNEL AGAIN THE TIME OF HIGH AND LOW WATER AT THE VIRTUAL HEAD OF THE TIDE REGULATES THE TURN OF THE UP AND DOWN STREAM ALONG THE WHOLE CHANNEL AS FAR AS THE CONTRACTION BEYOND THIS THE OFFING STREAM BEING GOVERNED BY ITS OWN HIGH WATER AND THAT OCCURRING AT ABOUT SIX HOURS EARLIER THAN THAT OF THE HEAD OF THE CHANNEL THE OFFING STREAM EITHER BUTTS AGAINST THE RETURNING STREAMS FROM THE CHANNELS OR WITHDRAWING ITS WATER SOLICITS THEIR STREAMS AND THUS ALTERS THEIR COURSE MAKING THEM FOR THE MOST PART SET ACROSS THE CHANNEL IN CURVES MORE OR LESS BENT AS THE SPOT IS MORE OR LESS REMOVED FROM THE OFFING SO THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE BUT ONE HOURS TIDE EACH WAY THAT PASSES CLEAN DOWN THE CHANNEL FROM BEACHY HEAD TO SCILLY AND ROUND THE LANDS END TO BRISTOL THE OUTGOING STREAM FROMN BEACHY HEAD EN MEETING OF COUNTERS THE INGOING STREAM OF THE OFFING TIDE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE START POINT AND THE STREAMS BOTH ARE TURNED DOWN INTO THE GREAT GULF OF ST MALO WHICH SEEMS TO RECEIVE THE ACCUMULATED WATERS OF THESE OPPOSITE TIDES WHETHER OR NOT THIS INFLUX IS INSTRUMENTAL IN RAISING THE WATER HERE TO THE EXTIA ORDINARY HEIGHT OF FORTYSEVEN FEET PERPENDICULAR RANGE AT SPRINGS OR WHETHER IT BE OWING TO ITS FORM AND POSITION AS REGARDS THE ADVANCING TIDEWAVE I LEAVE TO THOSE WHO ARE COMPETENT TO DECIDE BUT IT IS A COINCIDENCE THAT CANNOT ESCAPE OBSERVATION THAT THIS SPOT LIKE THE BRISTOL CHANNEL IS THE CONCENTRATION OF STREAMS FROM OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THAT IT HAS ITS WATERS RAISED TO THE SAME EXTRAORDINARY ELEVATION NEARLY TO A FOOT AND THAT ITS TIME OF HIGH WATER IS NEARLY THE SAME ON THE CHANGE OF TIDE THIS GREAT BAY LIKE THE BRISTOL CHANNEL AS IT RECEIVED SO IT MDCCCXLVIII Q114 CAPTAIN F W BEECHEY ON THE TIDES IN GULF OF ST RETURNS ITS WATERS IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS  THE TIDE SPLITTING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MALO TIDE ALDERNEY AND THE START BUT HERE ESPECIALLY AS ALSO IN A SIMILAR LOCALITY IN THE IRISH CHANNEL WE ARE IN WANT OF OBSERVATIONS AND IT IS VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS SPOT WHICH FROM ITS PECULIARITY IS THE MOST INTERESTING OF ANY IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL SHOULD BE SO COMPLETELY DEFICIENT FOR IT SEEMS MOST EVIDENT THAT THE TIDAL STREAMS MEET OFF HERE RUNNING TOGETHER AT ONE TIME AND SEPARATING AT ANOTHER SUCH APPEARS TO BE THE EXPLANATION OF THE COMPLICATED MOTION OF THE WATERS AT THE ENTRANCES OF THESE TWO GREAT CHANNELS AND OF THE COURSE OF THE STREAM IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL ABOVE THE CONTRACTION OF THE STRAIT IN TRACING THESE STREAMS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO BE IMPRESSED WITH THE MANY COINCIDENCES WHICH ASSIMILATE THE TIDAL PHENOMENA OF THE TWO CHANNELS SO MUCH SO AS TO RENDER IT PROBABLE THAT THEY ARE SUBJECTED TO PRECISELY THE SAME LAWS AS I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS SUBJECT WILL BE BOTH INTERESTING AND USEFUL I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO TRACE THE RESEMBLANCE THROUGH ITS SEVERAL VARIETIES FIRST I SHALL CONSIDER THE IRISH CHANNEL TO EXTEND AS ABOVE MENTIONED FROM A LINE JOINING THE LANDS END AND CAPE CLEAR TO THE END OF THE TIDAL FLOW WHICH IS COMPARISON EITHER AT MORECOMBE BAY OR PEEL IN THE ISLE OF MAN AND THE ENGLISH CHANNEL AS OF THE TIDAL REACHING FROM A LINE CONNECTING USHANT WITH THE LANDS END TO THE END OF ITS TIDAL PHENOMENA OF THE EN FLOW OR TO DUNGENESS WE SHALL THEN SEE THAT THE ENGLISH CHANNEL FROM ITS OUTER IGLISH CAND LIMIT TO THE END OF ITS TIDAL STREAM IS 262 GEOGRAPHICAL MILES AND THAT THE IRISH NELS CHANNEL FROM ITS WESTERN LIMIT TO THE END OF ITS TIDAL STREAM IS NEARLY THE SAME BEING ABOUT 265 GEOGRAPHICAL MILES IN BOTH CHANNELS THE STREAM ENTERS FROM THE SOUTH WEST AND FLOWS UP UNTIL STOPPED BY A COUNTER STREAM IN BOTH CHANNELS THERE IS A CONTRACTION OF THE STRAIT ALMOST MIDWAY BY THE PROMONTORIES OF CAPE LA HAGUE IN ONE INSTANCE AND ST DAVIDS HEAD IN THE OTHER AND AT VERY NEARLY THE SAME DISTANCES FROM THE ENTRANCE THIS CONTRACTION IS IN BOTH CASES THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE REGULAR STREAM WHICH FLOWS SIX HOURS NEARLY EACH WAY THE TURN OF THE STREAM THROUGH OUT COINCIDING WITH THE TIMES OF HIGH AND LOW WATER AT THE VIRTUAL HEAD OF THE CHANNEL SITUATED IN BOTH CASES ABOUT 145 MILES ABOVE THE CONTRACTION AND THAT TIME BEING VERY NEARLY THE SAME VIZ I0H 50M AT F AND C BELOW THIS CONTRACTION AWAY FROM THE LAND THE STREAM IN BOTH CASES VARIES ITS DIRECTION NEARLY EVERY HOUR ACCORDING TO THE FORCE EXERTED UPON IT BY THE OPPOSING OFFING STREAM IN BOTH CASES BETWEEN THE CONTRACTION AND THE SOUTHERN HORN OF THE CHANNEL THERE IS SITUATED A DEEP ESTUARY THE BRISTOL CHANNEL AND THE BAY OF ST MALO IN WHICH THE TIMES OF HIGH WATER COINCIDE AND WHERE IN BOTH CASES THE OPPOSING STREAMS MEETING IN THE CHANNEL POUR THEIR WATERS INTO THESE GULFS AND WHERE THE TIDES IN BOTH PLACES RISE TO THE EXTRAORDINARY ELEVATION OF FORTYSEVEN FEET AT THE SYZYGIES FROM THE LANDS END TO THE MEETING OF THESE STREAMS IN THE BRISTOL CHANNEL IS SEVENTYFIVE MILES AND FROM BREST TO THE MEETING OF THE STREAMS OFF GUERNSEY THE SAME A STILL FURTHER COINCIDENCE IS APPARENT BETWEEN

FIVE FEET RISE OF THE WATER AT A SPRING RANGE IN BOTH CASES THESE POINTS OF SMALL RANGE OF TIDE ARE SITUATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CHANNEL TO THAT OF THE HIGH ELEVATION ABOVE MENTIONED AND IN BOTH CASES THESE SPOTS ARE THE NODE OF THE TIDEWAVE ON EITHER SIDE OF WHICH THE TIMES OF HIGH AND LOW WATER ARE REVERSED AND AGAIN WE TRACE A SIMILARITY IN AN INCREASED RISE OF THE WATER ON THE SOUTHEAST SIDES OF BOTH CHANNELS ABREAST OF THE VIRTUAL HEAD OF THE TIDE AT LIVERPOOL IN ONE CASE WHERE THE RANGE AMOUNTS TO THIRTYTWO FEET AND AT CAYEUX IN THE OTHER WHERE IT IS THIRTYFOUR FEET IT MAY ALSO BE SHOWN THAT THE PROGRESS OF THE TIDEWAVE ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CHAN NELS OPPOSITE THE NODE IS NOT VERY DISSIMILAR RECKONING IN BOTH CASES FROM THE LINE WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE DRAWN AS THE OUTER LIMITS OF THE CHANNEL WE FIND THAT IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL FROM THIS LINE TO CHERBOURG OPPOSITE THE SMALL RANGE OF TIDE MILES PER HOUR MILES THE WAVE TRAVELS     501 R616 IN THE IRISH CHANNEL

SELECTION OF POSITIONS AND NUMBERS WOULD GIVE A STILL NEARER COINCIDENCE BESIDES WHICH WE ARE SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN AS TO THE ESTABLISHMENT AT OUR STARTING POINT AS A COMPARISON HOWEVER THE NUMBERS RUN FAIRLY TOGETHER IN BOTH CASES THE RETARDATION OF THE TIDEWAVE ABOUT MIDCHANNEL AND THE GREAT ELONGATION OF THE WAVE TOWARDS THE END OF THE STRAIT ARE REMARKABLE ESPECIALLY IN THE IRISH SEA LASTLY WE MAY NOTICE A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE IN MORE RESPECTS THAN ONE INDEED BETWEEN THE SITUATION OF THE NODE PLACED BY PROFESSOR WHEWELLT IN THE NORTH SEA AND A CORRESPONDING POINT OF SMALL RANGE AND INVERSION OF TIDE AT THE BACK OF KINTIRE THE NODE OR HINGE OF THE TIDE IN THE NORTH SEA IS CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SITUATED AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE AT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE HEAD OF THE TIDE OFF DUNGENESS

CAPT BEECHEY ON THE TIDES IN THE IRISH AND ENGLISH CHANNELS CATED BY CAPTAIN ROBINSON IS ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE MEETING OF THE TIDE IN THE IRISH SEA AS THE NORTH SEA NODE IS FROM THE MEETING OF THE WATERS OFF DUNGENESS AND IS SIMILARLY SITUATED WITH RESPECT TO THE NODE OF COURTOWN AS THE NORTH SEA NODE IS WITH REGARD TO SWANAGE IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT THE TIDAL FEATURE OF THESE TWO CHANNELS CORRESPONDS IN ALMOST EVERY PARTICULAR I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER THE IDENTITY VERY REMARKABLE AND INTERESTING AND ESPECIALLY FURTHER IN SO AS CONCERNS THE RELATIVE SITUATIONS OF THE NODES OF THE WAVE HINGING AS THOSE IN VESTIGATION THE CHANNEL APPEAR TO DO UPON A SINGLE POINT AND NOT UPON A NEGATIVE LINE ACROSS OF THE TIDAL PHENOMENA THE CHANNEL AS MAY HAVE BEEN IMAGINED AND IT SEEMS HIGHLY DESIRABLE THAT A OF ENGLISH CRITICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF THIS CHANNEL SHOULD BE MADE NOT ONLY FOR CHANNEL URGED THE PURPOSES OF SCIENCE BUT ESPECIALLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE NAVIGATION OF THE STRAIT FOR ALREADY WE MAY TRACE THE CAUSE OF VESSELS ENTERING THE CHANNEL BEING SET DOWN UPON THE FRENCH COAST ABOUT HEAUX AND WHO CAN CALL TO MIND THE LAMENTABLE LOSS OF OUR INDIAMEN ON THE COAST ABOUT BOULOGNE AND NOT BE REMINDED THAT THESE DISASTERS OCCURRED VERY NEAR THE POINT WHERE THE STREAM MAY PROBABLY BE TURNED DOWN UPON THAT SHORE BY THE MEETING OF THE TIDES OFF THERE HAVING NOW SIR PLACED BEFORE YOU THE RESULT OF OUR OBSERVATIONS UPON THE TIDES OF THE IRISH SEA AND SHOWN THE CONNECTION WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN THE PHENOMENA OF THE IRISH AND ENGLISH CHANNELS AND THE POSSIBILITY THERE IS OF FORMING INTO A SYSTEM THE APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY DIRECTIONS OF THE STREAM AT THE MOUTHS OF THOSE ESTUARIES WHICH IS SO VERY DESIRABLE I HAVE TO REQUEST THAT SHOULD YOU AFTER THE PERUSAL OF THIS LETTER APPROVE OF THE OBSERVATIONS BEING CONTINUED ROUND THE LANDS END AND UP THE ENGLISH CHANNEL YOU WILL SOLICIT THE LORDS COMMISSIONERS OF THE ADMIRALTY TO FURNISH THE MEANS OF SO DOING I HAVE

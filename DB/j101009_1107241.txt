WITNESSES TO WILLS AND EFFECT OF INTEREST UNDER WILL AS DISQUALIFICATION Several interesting questions on the above points have arisen under the case presented by the following statement of facts R was a man with an estate of nearly 10000000 He died and left a paper writing purporting to be his last will and testa ment bearing his signature and the signatures of two others as attesting witnesses Two lawyers brothers and partners in the practice of law were the only persons present with deceased when the will was prepared and one of them A was made execu torial trustee with full discretionary powers for sale and rein vestment of the corpus in loans on real estate security for a period of fifteen years on a 5 commission basis of compensa tion to the trusteeexecutor B the other partner was one of the attesting witnesses and C a third person was the other It was an admitted fact that the compensation received by A as executorial trustee would go to the firm of A and B and be shared by B The writing was admitted to probate ex parte a few days after deceaseds death before the clerk and an appeal there from by the widow and heirsatlaw perfected to the Circuit Court On this appeal an issue d v n was made up and tried before a jury and a verdict sustaining the will rendered A motion to set aside the verdict was overruled as also was a mo tion to set aside the probate of the will On this trial the following cognate propositions of law were advanced by the contestants of the alleged will a An executor in trust is disqualified to testify in a will contest where he is a party and proponent although not an attesting witness unless he gives security for costs b An executor in trust to whom the estate is devised and bequeathed and who is named in a will which is attested by a witness who shares with him the commissions and profits of the trust takes such a beneficial interest in the estate as was voided by Sec 2529 of the Code of Virginia 1887 1920  4076 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S c Where one of two attesting witnesses to a will shares the profits of the trustee named in the instrument and to whom the estate is devised and bequeathed he has such beneficial interest in the subject matter as disqualifies him as a sub scribing witness and the will is void Note Proposition a is no longer true since the Code of 1919 and discussion of that will be omitted As Sec 2529 of the Code of 1887 was repealed by the Code of 1919 proposition b is unimportant now except that as we will indicate below cases may arise as to which it may be it would have been better to retain  2529 Therefore we will take up the last towit c first and then b second FIRST W4Zhere one of tzvo attesting witnesses to a will shares the profits of the trustee named in the instrument and to whom the estate is devised and bequeathed he has such beneficial interest in the subject matter as disqualifies him as t subscribing witness and the will is void Note Although many changes were made by the 1919 Code in the statute law discussed by this article still a will must be attested by witnesses competent at the time of attestation and it may well be doubtful if a change in the rule of competency would retroactively validate an attestation invalid when made Therefore this discussion of proposition c may be very perti nent still The competency of witnesses to wills is of two kinds 1st Competency to subscribe or attest the will 2nd Competency to testify on an issue assailing it a Competency of the first class is a matter of substantive law This is regulated and controlled by statute and the existing common law E g any person taking a beneficial interest under the will cannot attest it Such person is not compe tent at common law or by statute The reason is they are interested and may take advantage of the testator 408  OctATTESTING WITNESSES TO WILLS b Competency of the second class is referred to the rules of Evidence A person might be incompetent as an attesting witness but competent as an evidentiary witness on an issue d v n E g a devisee or legatee is not competent to attest at common law or under the statute because he is interested in the execution of the will but by statute in most of the states he is now made competent by an avoidance of this interest to be either an evidentiary witness or an attesting witness If there are two competent attesting witnesses exclusive of himself the execution is valid otherwise it is void Bruce v Shuler 108 Va 670 Competency of the first class is thus stated by I Wigmore on Ev 582 Whether the person attesting a will is eligible as such is purely a question of the substantive law applicable to the validity of wills The object of the statute is not to deter mine the competency of the person called to testify to the will but to secure the execution of the will under formali ties of a specified sort The will is required to be in writ ing to be signed by certain persons and to be signed in the presence of certain persons if these rules are followed the will is valid in form and no one of the rules is more a rule of evidence than another Sec 3345 of the Code of 1887 operated to remove the bar of incompetency in general legal proceedings of persons in interest and also parties to all civil proceedings But the next section of the same chapter on Evidence excepted from the operation of the enabling act attesting witnesses to wills deeds and other in struments Sec 3346 Qualifications of preceding section The preceding section is subject to the following qualifications First of Husband and Wife and Witnesses to Deeds and Wills The competency of husband and wife as witnesses for and against each other during the coverture or after its termina tion and the competency of attesting witnesses to wills 409 1920 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S deeds and other instruments shall be determined by the law in force the day before this Code takes effect The subsequent enactments made in 18934 p 722 18978 p 753 19012 p 798 enlarged the privileges of husband and wife as witnesses in both civil and criminal cases but the competency of attesting witnesses to wills deeds and other instruments re mained as formerly 2 Minor 3rd Ed 1014 1015 Among the several classes of witnesses to wills whose com petency may come into question Prof Minor enumerates an executor who is an Attesting Witness to the Will He makes this enumleration over the citation of the Statute indicated Sec 2531 Code 1887 and the case of Coalter v Bryan 18 Gratt 1 at p 87 94 and of Martz v Martz 25 Gratt 363 thus indicat ing that their competency is not affected by the Statute or by those cases as in neither case was the executor an attesting wit ness and in Coalter v Bryan he was not even a party to the probate and did not propound the will Section 2531 of the Code of 1887 retained as  5245 of 1919 Code is as follows No person shall on account of his being an executor of a will be incompetent as a witness for or against the will i e on an issue d v n This Statute has no reference to an attesting executor The language of this Statute which was enacted because of the doubt raised on the probate of the Randolph will in Coalter v Bryan supra decided in May 1844 confines the competency to questions of valid ity which might be raised on an issue involving sanity un due influence and the like and this appears more strikingly when contrasted with the language of the Statute next pre ceding as to competency of creditors These are made com petent even to attest the will when the estate devised is charged with the payment of their debts Vide 4 Minors Ins 3 Ed 108 109 where the distinction is drawn in the text Section 2530 of Code of 1887 retained as  5244 of 1919 Code is If a will charging an estate with debts be attested by a credi tor  Such creditor shall notwithstanding be admitted a witness for or against the wzeill 410  OctATTESTING WITNESSES TO WILLS Both of these Statutes are first found in the Code of 1849 and are taken in part from the English Statute 1 Vict ch 26 which went into effect July 3 1837 But the Virginia Statute mate rially restricted the competency of an executor as compared with the English Statute Sec 17 which is as follows XVII And be it further enacted that no person shall on account of his being an executor of a will be incompetent to be admitted as a witness to prove the execution of such will or a witness to prove the validity or invalidity thereof This English Statute recognizes the distinction between the two classes of witnesses required to prove a the execution and b the validity or invalidity of a will and makes the executor competent to do either On the other hand the Virginia Stat ute confines the executors competency to testimony for or against the will as contradistinguished from competency to prove its statutory execution Section XVI of the English Statute to which Sec 2530 of the Code 1887 corresponds is likewise more comprehensive than the Virginia Statute in the same particular as that relating to exec utors It reads XVI And be it further enacted that in case by any will any real or personal estate shall be charged with any debt or debts and any creditors or the wife or husband of any creditor whose debt is so charged shall attest the execution of such will such creditor notwithstanding such charge shall be admitted a witness to prove the executionl of such will or to prove the validity or ilvalidity thereof The legislative intent to make no change in the rule of com petency required of attesting witnesses was conclusively demon strated by the action of the General Assembly on the report of the revisors of the Code of 1849 The revisors as appears from notes appended to their report page 628 Report of Revisors 1840 considered the question under discussion They advised a relaxation of the rule which rendered incompetent attesting witnesses to the extent of admitting them in cases in which it was made to appear that their interest was waived or had other wise disappeared They proposed this Statute Sec 18 The objection that a person who attested the execution of a will was 1920  4116 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S at the time of such execution an incompetent witness shall not be valid if at the time of proving the will he be competent But the General Assembly declined to relax the old rule and struck out the section quoted thus plainly adhering to previous adjudications of the law When the revisors of the Code of 1887 made their report they also adhered to the old rule and the legislative intent as indicated by the exceptive clause in Sec 3346 of the 1887 Code The revisors of the Code of 1919 were silent on this point and left these two sections as they were Until the enabling legislation executors and other personal represent atives were incompetent witnesses when parties to actions and suits and it became necessary to pass the statute later codified as Sec 2531 of the Code of 1887 to qualify executors as wit nesses even in cases involving the contests of wills The very negativeness of the form of the statute discloses the necessity for its enactment But this statute as heretofore indicated merely qualifies exec utors to testify for or against a will and does not qualify them to attest it It was apparently designed to meet the situation con fronting Judge Leigh in the John Randolph will contest upon whose competency to testify on the trial as to the sanity of the testator so much doubt was thrown He was not an attesting witness He was not even a party to the probate neither insist ing upon nor contesting the validity of the execution of the will He was merely an executor in a prior will which had been pro bated Even so his competency to testify on the hearing merely as to testamentary capacity was challenged by the ablest lawyers of that day in Virginia and his competency was so much doubted that the statute in reference was passed That it was confined to just this particular purpose is apparent from a consideration of its terms themselves and more strikingly by a comparison of it with the language employed in the next preceding section respecting creditors It was pointed out by Judge Keith in the case of Bruce v Shuler 108 Va at page 677 Creditors are made competent attesting witnesses in so many words Executors are made competent merely to testify for or against the will but not to attest it Their incompetency to attest remains as before Sec 2531 Code 1887 412  OctATTESTING WITNESSES TO WILLS If the revisors of the Code of 1887 who were very learned lawyers had not recognized the then existing difference between the competency of an executor to testify for or against the will under Sec 2531 and that of an attesting witness to a will under Sec 2414 why did they deem is necessary to insert the ex ceptive clause in Sec 3346 Mr Minor notes it by calling at tention to the classes of cases which may arise in the attestation of wills and Judge Keith in Bruce v Shuler 108 Va at page 677 notes it in concluding his opinion In the Code of 1849 p 663 as already pointed out it is pro vided that No trustee executor or other fiduciary shall be in competent as a witness in any case by reason only of his being a party thereto or of his being liable to costs in respect thereof but if liable to costs he shall not be competent unless some per son undertake to pay the same This statute was embraced in the compilations of 1860 and 1873 by Mr Munford and was the law in force on the day before the Code of 1887 went into effect Code Sec 3346 In order to remove nonattesting executors from its influence it was deemed necessary to enact the special statute Sec 2531 which still stands as  5245 Code 1919 In Riddell v Johnson 26 Gratt 152 this rule is shown as it existed before the enabling act The distinction between an executor who is an attesting wit ness and one who is not so is specifically pointed out by Judge Anderson in Martz v Martz 25 Gratt 346 decided in Septem ber 1874 There the executor was received as a witness to sustain the will on the contest upon the very ground that he was not an attesting witness Competency of Attesting Witnesses Who Are Executors in Trust In the case of Coalter v Bryan 1 Gratt at p 93 May 1844 Judge Baldwin points out the difference between the decisions holding an executor in trust who is not an attesting witness competent to testify on the issue devisavit vel non when the contest is between the estate he represents and others claiming adversely thereto and 2 in contests between persons claiming not adversely to the estate but having conflicting interests there 1920 1 4136 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S in and 3 between those cases and one in which the cestuis que trust call the executor to account In that case the executor in trust Judge Wm Leigh was not an attesting witness nor was he a party He refused to pro pound the will for probate or to take part in the proceedings As Section 3346 Code 1887 retained the bar as to attesting witnesses the executor in trust A was excluded whatever his position as a party to the proceedings As he was here a pro pounder and in addition takes a beneficial interest he was there by doubly barred Bruce v Shuler 108 Va 670 infra That Statute Sec 3346 declared that the rule of law of attesting witnesses should remain as it was on the day before the Code of 1887 went into effect Under it persons taking any beneficial interest are incompetent unless the will cannot be otherwise proved i e by two competent witnesses other than the attesting beneficial witness Bruce v Shuler 108 Va 670 infra The policy of the law is sound as requiring a proper safeguard to testamentary dispositions Its purpose is benign as removing temptation from the minds of those most exposed to its influence The books have many cases in which lawyers have refused to accept the executorship of wills they were called upon to attest and conversely who have declined to attest wills they were nom inated to execute Besides the American cases infra the question was before the English Chancery in the Court of Appeals in recent years since the Statute of 1 Vict ch 26 Secs 15 17 and these will be noticed more in detail presently They hold in accordance with the contestants contention here The principle contended for was decided by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in the case of Bruce v Shuler 108 Va 670 That case like this turns on the proper construc tion of Sec 2514 and Sec 2529 Code of 1887 and will be pres ently discussed fully Section 2514 provides now  5229 Code 1919 substantially unchanged No will shall be valid unless it be in writing and signed by the testator or by some other person in his presence and by  Oct 414ATTESTING WITNESSES TO WILLS his direction in such manner as to make it manifest that the name is intended as a signature and moreover unless it be wholly written by the testatoi the signature shall be made or the will acknowledged by him in the presence of at least two competent witnesses present at the same time and such witnesses shall subscribe the will in the presence of the testator but no form of attestation shall be necessary Section 2529 omitted from Code 1919 provides If a will be attested by a person to whom or to whose wife or husband any beneficial interest in any estate is thereby devised or bequeathed if the will may not be otherwise proved such person shall be deemed a competent witness but such devise or bequest shall be void    As the last Statute originally stood the words or to whose wife or husband did not appear The amended Statute Code 1849 p 519 Sec 19 enlarges the terms to that extent But an important enlargement of the disqualification of attesting wit nesses was the substitution of the words any beneficial interest for the former words any bequest Even before the change so jealous was this Court in safeguarding a testator by disquali fying attesting witnesses because of interest it was held that any bequest was broad enough to include an interest in lands Croft v Croft 4 Gratt 103 So that in the former state of the law the competency of an attesting witness in Sec 2514 was to be measured by the words of disqualification found in Sec 2529 If the attesting witness takes any beneficial interest in any estate under the will while he is made competent by the avoidance of that interest to prove the execution still the full statutory requirements of Sec 2514 must be met i e the will must have been attested by two competent witnesses conmetent at the time of attestation If these requisites are wanting the will is void This Statute to the extent indicated is merely declaratory of the common law The saving clause which follows and which relaxes the rigor of the rule in certain cases indicates the reason for the change It is this As frequent injustice resulted to innocent objects of a testators bounty by declaring the whole testament void it was deemed a sufficient safeguard to the protection of the testators estate to declare void only so much of the testament as gave a 1920  4156 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S beneficial interest to the witness subscribing Therefore it may well be unfortunate that Sec 2429 was omitted entirely This point is fully discussed by Judge Keith in Bruce v Shuler 108 Va 670 a case elaborately annotated and approved in 35 L R A N S and it is decided as herein contended Judge Keith says In Shuler sic on Wills 3rd Ed Sec 353 it is said The disqualification of interest is that which courts have chiefly to consider where the competency of a subscribing witness is drawn in question One who has an immediate beneficial interest in a will is at the common law disqualified from becoming a subscribing witness thereto He is neither competent nor credible in the sense of the Statute and the test of competency is the state of facts when the will is made and not when it comes into operation It is proper to observe that our statute which has made so many and such radical changes with respect to the competency of wit nesses does not affect the competency of attesting witnesses to wills deeds and other instruments Code Sec 3346 The object of the statute was to prevent frauds as well as perjuries Wills are frequently made by a testator in ex tremis or when he is greatly debilitated by age or infirmity when fraud may be practiced upon him with facility by the crafty and designing and it was the intention of the Statute to guard against such practice and protect the testator by surrounding him with disinterested witnesses at the critical and important moment when he is about to execute his will They are to be disinterested and credible also at the time of attestation because in some sense they are made the judges of the testators sanity It is their duty to inquire into this matter and if they think the testator not capable they should remonstrate and refuse their attestation That the new Code has not entirely discarded the disqualifi cation of interest is shown by its still requiring a holographic will be proved by at least two disinterested witnesses See last clause new of Sec 5229 The conclusion reached was that notwithstanding the provi sions of Sec 2529 of our Code which says If a will be attested by a person to whom or to whose wife or husband any beneficial interest in any estate is thereby devised or bequeathed if the will may not otherwise be proved such person shall be deemed a competent witness 416  OctATTESTING WITNESSES TO WILLS A will subscribed by two witnesses one of whom is incompetent by reason of interest is void because the other witness cannot prove that the instrument was attested as the Statute Sec 2514 requires Says the opinion In our judgment the true view of the Statute is that the words if the will may not otherwise be proved has refer ence to a case where the devisee or legatee is needed as an attesting witness to make up the number required by law in which he is made a competent witness by the avoidance of his interest and he may be also called to testify at the probate of the will This ruling is in accord with the courts of other jurisdictions These cases in part follow It will be observed that Judge Keith draws the distinction between the competency of a witness to prove the execution of the will and one qualified to testify on the final probate on an issue made for the purpose The Supreme Court of Illinois in Smith v Goodell 101 N E 255 258 Ill 145 decided February 20 1913 and a rehear ing denied April 2 1913 disposed of the precise question upon a state of facts strikingly agreeable to that presented here Butzow wrote the will of Smith and was one of the two at testing witnesses Butzows business partners were named in the instrument as executors in trust and it was shown that their commissions would be shared with Butzow A jury on an is sue found a verdict sustaining its validity but the will was held void by the appellate court for illegal attestation and the lower court was reversed The opinion notes the distinction to be borne carefully in mind between the case of an attestant who is an executor and acquires ex vi termini the forbidden beneficial interest and the case of an attestant who has a beneficial interest in fact but not in appearance In the one case the disqualification is prima facie the instrument itself in the other case the disqualification is ie hors the instrument For example the attesting witnesses in the second case may have a secret understanding with an execu tor to share commissions or with a devisee to share an estate in land or an attestant might be a creditor of the testator before the common law rule of disqualification in such case was changed 2 417 1920 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S in Virginia by statute orbefore the time of the enabling stat utean attestant might be a spouse of a beneficiary All such witnesses would have the forbidden beneficial interest de nounced by statute but it would not be patent It would exist not by the terms of the instrument but independently of it Yet on the trial of an issue as soon as this beneficial interest did come into the case and was satisfactorily established the dis qualification would be absolute And its effect would be more far reaching than in those cases where the disqualification for interest appears on the face of the instrument because there is no provision in the statute except as to creditors and spouses for making such witnesses competent by avoidance of interest The disqualification arises outside of the instrument and is with in the bar of the common law whereas the statute modifying the common law applies only to cases of disqualification arising by the terms of the instrument itself The Court affirmed that it was committed to the view that one is not a competent witness to the execution of a will which names him as executor Distinguishing Jones v Greiser 87 N E 295 As the will under consideration is attested by two witnesses only one of whom is shown and substantially admitted to be in competent it is not executed as the law requires And as the statute does not remove the bar of incompetency in a case where the disqualification arises de hors the instrument it follows the will is void and the motion to set aside the order of probate should have prevailed and the motion to set aside the verdict of the jury as being contrary to the law and the evidence should also have prevailed for the same reason There is no difference in principle between the decision in the Illinois case just cited and that of Bruce v Shuler supra Bruce wrote the will and attested it with another He was appointed by the will as Executor and also took a beneficial interest under its provisions As the will could not be proved as having been attested by the two competent credible witnesses required by the statute it was a void instrument and this court so held The facts here are that the will of R was produced before the Clerk in the Clerks office and proved by the oaths of B 418  OctATTESTING WITNESSES TO WILLS and C the subscribing witnesses thereto and ordered to be re corded On the appeal to the Circuit Court as soon as it be came apparent from the evidence that B one of the subscribing witnesses was a partner with the executor in trust to whom the entire estate is devised and bequeathed by the very terms of the testament for fifteen years and participated in the profits it was plain that the will had therefore been not legally attested by two disinterested credible witnesses and had been unlawfully admitted to probate As already stated the motion to annul and set aside the order of probate should have prevailed under the authority of Bruce v Shuler supra See also Fearn v Posttewaite 111 88 N E 1057 The case of Crowell v Tuttle 105 N E 980 was before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in 1914 Ellis signed as an attesting witness The will contained a bequest of funds to a church for the purpose of retiring a prom issory note on which Ellis name appeared as one of several guarantors He was held incompetent on the ground of interest See also In re Palethorps Estate Pa 94 Atl 1061 holding that an attesting witness who was a stockholder in a trust com pany named in the will as executor in trust was incompetent EXECUTORS IN TRUST DUAL CAPACITY In the case of Jones v Broadbent 123 P 496 Idaho 1912 there is pointed out in a full argument the dual capacity of persons who are appointed executors and trustees and the dis tinction between the two offices The testator left the widow that portion only of his estate to which she was entitled by law The third clause devised and bequeathed the remainder of his estate to be divided into four equal parts three of which he gave outright to three of his children and the fourth part he placed in trust with his two executors for the benefit of a fourth son The executors made a contract of sale for part of the property and the purchasers refusing to perform a deed was tendered and a suit for specific performance instituted The refusal to perform was grounded on the objection that the executors could not sell the lot in contract and give title thereto 419 1920 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S The opinion says It appears from the provisions of said will and the record before us that plaintiffs have two offices imposed upon them by said will namely that of executors of said will and that of trustees and the question directly raised is at what period of time do they cease to act as executors and their duties as trustees begin    The duties of plaintiffs are separate distinct and independ ent of each other and until the executors are discharged and they assume the duties of trustees their powers and duties as executors continue Citing Cases Of course if during the administration a partial distribution is made the executor should be discharged as to such part and could then act as trustee    Before distribution they held possession of all property of said estate as executors not as trustees and they as trus tees would have no authority to intermeddle or interfere with the due administration of said estate until such ad ministration had been completed and until they had been discharged as executors or until a partial distribution had been made When the same person has been appointed by will to perform some dual duty such as executor and trustee in respect to the property of the estate no service is demanded of him as trustee until he had performed his executorial obligations and distribution is made In re Roachs Est 92 P 118 Oregon he court then decreed that as far as it was necessary to pay the debts of the estate the power of sale was in the executors and deemed that as far as it need go in the matter The Supreme Court of New Jersey in Snedeker v Allen 1 N J L 35 says on the point It appears on the face of the instrument in question that two witnesses were called the surrogate as it seems aware that the evidence of the subscribing witness Peter John ston was not sufficient admitted Ort Vanpelt one of the executors to prove that this will was executed in due form of law And the question now arises can an executor be a competent witness to prove a will It is contended by the counsel for the defendant that he can a number of cases 420  OctATTESTING WITNISSES TO WILLS have been cited in support of this opinion and the noted one of Lowe v Jolliffe much relied on But it must be re memhbered that Dovey the executor of Jolliffe released a legacy of 200 pounds which he was to receive as compen sation for his services before he was admitted as an evi dence had Ort Vanpelt released his claim to all compensa tion for his services as an executor I think he would have stood on equal ground with Dovey As it does not appear that this was done under the general principle that he wtho is interested in or redeives a benefit from a witl shall not be permitted to prove it I am of the opinion that Ort Vanpelt was not a credible witness within the meaning of the law In Tucker v Tucker 5 Iredell 27 N C 272 the court held that One who is named as executor in a will is so far interested by reason of the commissions to which he is by law entitled as to render him an incompetent attesting witness as re gards the disposition of the personal property And the will was declared void as a will of personalty It was held good as to the realty devised upon the specific ground that the will did not give the executors a commission upon the sale as was done in Allison v Allison 4 Hawes 141 Nor did the law give it to them The statute confined commis sions to personalty If the will had given compensation or had the law done so it is clear the decision would have been the same as to both questions as appears below See also Morton v Morton 11 Iredell N C 368 Gunter v Gunter 3 Jones 441 48 N C Tucker v Tucker 5 Ire 161 Morton v In gram 11 Ire 368 Huie v McConnell 2 Jones 455 Allison v Allison 4 Hawks 141 In North Carolina an executor is now made competent to prove the execution of the will in which he is appointed or to prove the validity thereof R C of North Carolina ch 119 Sec 9 But this will was executed the testa trix died and an issue devisavit vel non was made up all before the Revised Code went into operation It will be observed that a special act was necessary in that state to make an attesting executor competent as a witness to the execution but the common law rule remained in Virginia up to Jan 1 1920 192 1 4216 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S The Supreme Court of Texas in a case decided in 1881 passed squarely on the point in a case involving the probate of a nuncupative will Suit was brought to prove the will which purported to devise a lot in the city of Austin and provided that John M Holland as executor should take possession of the remainder of testators property and pay his debts The case is Watts v Holland 56 Texas 54 It was opposed on the probate by a sister of the decedent and her husband On the trial the executor was received as a witness and this was held error and the case reversed The incompetency of the executor as a witness to establish the will was placed on the common law rule the executor received no other interest in the estate save the statutory commissions The right to make nuncupative wills is preserved by statute in Virginia Sec 2615 Code of 1887 In Taylor v Taylor 1 Rich 531 the Supreme Court of South Carolina held an executor to be an incompetent attesting witness to a will under the statute of that statute corresponding to ours upon the ground of interest The same court in Vinyard v Brown 4 McCord 24 held that an executor was incompetent upon the ground of interest In the case of In re Stinsons Estate Penn 1911 the dis qualifying character of the interest is passed upon It is re ported in 81 At 207 Here the testatrix devoted nearly the whole of her estate to the establishment of a charity to be used as a Womans Christian Association The institution was not in existence but was created by the terms of her will Therein in precatory words she nominated among others one of the two attesting witnesses to be members of the executive committee of the institution The court below held that the interest which the attesting witness had in the estate devised disqualified her as an attesting witness under the Pennsylvania statute requiring wills to be attested by two disinterested witnesses This was affirmed on appeal and the will declared void See also Kess lers Est 70 At 770 The Pennsylvania statute does not require the attesting or proving witness to subscribe the instrument as is required in Virginia though the two words are frequently used interchange ably Cf the Virginia statute 1887 Sec 2514 The act of 422  OctATTESTING WITNESSES TO WILLS Pennsylvania 1855 substitutes the word attest for the word prove which change of terms would seem to require a sub scription Cf Combs Appeal 1884 105 Penn At 161 But as to the character of witnesses the Pennsylvania and Virginia statutes are identicalthat is they must be competent In Hogan v Hinchey 94 S W 522 the Supreme Court of Missouri 1906 held that under the express provisions of its statute Rev St 1899 Sec 4637 one named as executor is not incompetent to testify as a witness in a suit contesting the will Note He is also made competent for or against the will by statute in Virginia but approved in positive terms the point made by contestants in the pending case and refused to say that an executor in trust is a competent witness even in a contest That an executor in trust with power of sale or to collect money and apply it receives a substantial interest under a will seems to be the opinion of the court Durant v Starr 11 Mass 527 was an appeal from the pro bate court refusing to probate the will of Abigail Starr An issue was made up on the question of her sanity and the appellant offered the executor as a witness on the issue The trial court refused to admit him He was not an attesting witness And it was urged by appellant that as executor he had no interest in supporting the will being a mere trustee and having no devise or legacy given him therein The Supreme Court refused to accept this view and sustained the lower court upon the authority of the following 1 Phillips on Ev Secs 69 70 7th Ed Roscoe on Ev 2nd Ed 85 Nason v Thacher 7 Mass 398 SECOND If the testament is not absolttely void at the common law and under the declaratory statute requiring wills to be attested by at least two competent witnesses then certainly so much of it as creates A executor and trustee woutld be void under the provi sions of Sec 2529 of the Code of 1887 supra Note This article might be ended here as Sec 2529 of 423 1920 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S Code 1887 has been repealed but as already intimated cases may arise in which the need for it may be very urgent We are dealing in this case not with a bare executor whose powers and duties are prescribed by law and may be supervised by a controlling court of equity We have here combined an executor and trustee with unlimited powers specifically granted by the creative instrument It is recorded in the instrument itself that the executor and trustee is a devisee and legatee therein and within the very terms of the prohibitive statute upon which the rejected instruction is based The testament reads I give devise and bequeath unto my executor and trustee This is in terms a devise for years to the executor in trust with remainder over The limitation of the devise in trust for a term cannot alter the legal effectuation which the language quoted plainly expresses Otherwise a devise limited for life or for a term would stand upon a different juristic foundation from a devise in fee in contemplation of this protective statute The very statement of such an anomaly refutes it It is quality not quantity of interest which is sought to be reached As Judge Wilde said in Hawes v Humpreys 9 Pick 350 358 supra such an interest however minute will disqualify a witness And the disqualifying language of the statute embraces any beneficial interest in any estatethat is for life for a term in trust or otherwise In this case therefore the executor and trustee carrying these extraordinary plenary powers stands upon a higher plane of interest pecuniarily and juristically than one clothed in bare executorial garb He has the legal title and may convey the estate by his sole deed Nevertheless it is submitted that even considered as a bare executor without more the policy and reason of the statute ex cludes him from reaping the fruits of such a bargain and under the admitted facts makes null and void that clause of the testa ment at the very least which creates him executor and trustee This precise question was before the Illinois Supreme Court as recently as December 1915 Scott v Couch 111 N E 272 rehearing denied February 3 1916 The former decisions are adhered to in an opinion of such cogent reasoning it is quoted at some length for convenience The facts were that an 424  OctATTESTING WITNESSES TO WILLS attesting witness was a stockholder in a Trust and Savings Bank and the institution itself was named as executor It was held that the Bank by reason of the commission allowed it by law took a beneficial interest under the will and that as its stock holders participated in such profits they were thereby rendered incompetent as attesting witnesses except by avoiding and an nulling the appointment of the Bank as executor In other words the stockholder was competent as an attesting witness but the bank was incompetent to act as executor The opinion in part follows 13 On January 4 1913 Michael OConnor executed an instrument as his last will and testament at the Peoples Trust  Savings Bank in Galesburg where he had done considerable business and he died on May 24 1914 The attestation clause was in the usual form containing all the statutory requirements and it was signed by Nellie Stark and W H Pankey as witnesses Nellie Stark was a ste nographer and clerk in the bank and she testified to the execution of the will and that in her opinion the testator was at that time of sound mind and memory W H Pan key was the other subscribing witness and testified to the execution of the will and that at the time he regarded the testator as of sound mind and memory but his testimony was stricken out by the court because he was a director and stockholder of the bank which was appointed executor of the will The statute of wills provides that a will must be attested in the presence of the testator or testatrix by two or more credible witnesses and that means witnesses who at the time were competent in law to testify concern ing the subject matter Harp z Parr 168 Ill 459 48 N E 113 Johnson v Johnson 187 Ill 86 58 N E 237 The test of competency is whether the vitness will gain or lose financially as a direct result of the establishing of the in strument as a weill OBrien v Bonfield 312 Ill 428 72 N E 1090 Under that rule a person who is appointed exec utor by a will is incompetent to attest it as a witness be cause he will gain the commissions allowed by law if the will is established and that is a direct financial gain to him and another person who by virtue of a contract is to share in the fees earned by the executor is equally incompetent Smith v Goodell 258 Ill 145 101 N E 255 The test whether a witness has an interest which disqualifies him under the act concerning evidence and depositions to tes 1920  4256 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S tify against an heir devisee or legatee is whether he will immediately gain or lose by the event of the suit or whether the verdict can be given in evidence for or against him in another suit The interest must be a legal interest in the outcome of the suit and it must be certain direct and im mediate Feitl v Chicago City Railway Co 211 Ill 279 71 N E 991 Jones v Abbott 235 Ill 220 85 N E 279 Ackman v Potter 239 Ill 587 88 N E 231    There is however a special statutory provision applicable to a witness attesting the execution of a will 4 In the revision of 1872 Laws 187172 p 775 a pro vision of the Revised Statutes of 1845 was brought for ward as Section 8 of the Statute of Wills Hurds Rev St 1913 c 148 It removed the incompetency of a witness to the execution of a will to whom any beneficial devise legacy or interest was made or given by the will and pro vided that such witness should be compellable to appear and give testimony on the residue of the will in like manner as if no such devise or bequest had been made but the devise legacy or interest was declared to be null and void unless the will had been duly attested by a sufficient num ber of witnesses exclusive of such person saving however to the witness any share of the testators estate not exceed ing the value of the devise or bequest to which the witness would have been entitled if the will was not established That section of the statute of wills was regarded by this court as remedial and its purpose and effect was explained in Jones v Grieser 238 Ill 183 87 N E 295 15 Ann Cas 787    That decision was adhered to and indorsed in Fear v Postlethwaite 240 Ill 626 88 N E 1057 where it was again said that although one named as an executor is not a competent witness to the will he may be com pelled if his testimony is needed to abandon his executor ship and testify to the execution of the will That case however involved the question of the competency of the wife of the person named as executor and it was held that her incompetency was not removed by Section 8 since noth ing was given to her by the will and like the wife of a devisee or legatee she was prohibited from testifying for or against the interest of her husband on grounds of public policy After the decision in the Fearn Case the General Assembly in 1911 amended Section 8 by broadening its terms so as 426  OctATTESTING WITNESSES TO WILLS to include the wife or husband of any witness to whom any benefit was given by the will and declaring that on account of the remedial character of the section it should be con strued liberally    In this case the incompetency of Pankey arose from the fact that the will gave a beneficial interest to the corporation of which he was a director and a stockholder and the bene ficial interest to the stockholder was direct immediate and substantial Every dollar and every piece of property that comes to a corporation comes directly to the stockholders and increases the value of their stock In substance the stockholders collectively represented by the artificial cor porate entity were executors of the will The interest of Pankey was derived directly from the will and not through any private contrtct or arrangement outside of it and his incompetency arose directly from the beneficial interest given to him and the other stockholders as a corporation The statute applied and the court erred in striking out his testimony The bank being disqualified to act as executor and therefore having no interest M 0 Williamson who was rejected as a witness was competent to testify gen erally in the case The contestant introduced no evidence whatever on the sub ject of testamentary capacity but was content to rest upon the proposition that W H Pankey was an incompetent wit ness and the opinion of the two nurses that the testator was not of sound mind and memory The will and codicil were attested in the manner required by the statute and the court erred in holding the contrary The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded The English Chancery is in accord with this doctrine In the case of In re Pooley 40 L R C D 1 the Court of Appeals held that a solicitor who was an attesting witness to a will who was also a trustee took a beneficial interest under a clause al lowing him compensation for services Mr Justice Sir James Sterling first heard the case in the court below and upon a rul ing on the point adverse to Poole the latter took the case into the Court of Appeals where it was decided in October 1888 In other words even if the cqmmon law had not been changed by the statute Mr Pooley was not competent to attest the will 1920  4276 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S because he took an interest for services under the clause in question It is to be observed that in England there is no statutory al lowance to the executor for discharging his duties but a rule of the Chancery gives the remuneration In re Barber 31 L R C D at 669 1886 Our practice goes much further and gives reasonable expenses and a reasonable commission Code Sec 2695 and Notes The case referred to by Mr Justice Cooton In re Barber supra was this By will dated the 27th November 1882 Mrs Barber appointed Harmer a solicitor and her daughter Mrs Vinnecome executor and executrix of her will and gave them her estate in trust with power to sell and after paying her debts to divide the balance between her two daughters in equal shares Harmer was an attesting witness to the will and under one of its clauses was empowered to charge for services to be rendered Harmer obtained probate and then employed his partner Rud dock to do the wlork necessary to executing the trust The court held that this was a beneficial interest to the at testing witness which accordingly under Mr Justice Lindleys opinion in the case of Pooley supra made him incompetent under the old law See Burgess v Vinnecome 31 ch Div 665 34 ch Div 77 40 ch Div 1 In Scotland where the exec utor was one of the attesting witnesses it was held that the testament was null as to his appointment but good in other re spects Tait on Evid 84 Contributed Article Edited by JAMES F MINOR Charlottesville Va 428  Oct

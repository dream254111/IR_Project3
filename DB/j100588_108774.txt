and for successive Integrations By Sir J F W HERSCHEL Bart FBS c Received April 26Read June 14 1860 IN the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1807 Dr BRINKLEY has investigated the general value of the coefficient of any term in the development of the function i  and his result is remarkable for the mode of its expression in terms of the successive differences of the powers of zero or of the numbers comprised in the general expression Am0 Since that time in my paper published in the Transactions of the Society for 1815 On the Development of Exponential Functions I have exhibited other and much more simple as well as more easily calculable expressions for the same coefficient by means of the same useful and valuable differences and in that and other subsequent memoirs have extended their application to a variety of interesting inquiries in the theory of differences and series It is singular however that up to the present time it has never been shown that the formulae of Dr BRINKLEY and my own though affording in all cases coincident numerical results are analytically reconcileable with each other nor indeed is it at all easy to see either from the course of his investigation which turns upon an intricate application of the combinatory analysis or from the nature of the formula itself how it is possible to pass from the one form of expression to the other so as to show their identity This is what I now propose Referring to my  Collection of Examples in the Calculus of Finite Differences will be found the following relation which enables us to pass from the differences of any one power of zero as 0 to those of any other as 0 viz log l   nA0xx1  xn1 fA0 or changing x into xn log  lA fA0xnxlx2 xn fA0 As this equation is general so long as negative indices of A do not occur we may fA change fA into l 1  and it becomes falog  A   fA0xlxn 0 provided always that f contains no negative powers of A In this for fA sub  Camb 1820 p 70 Ex 6 2u2320 SIR J

expression is therefore now divested of its form in which successive different powers of 0 occur and reduced to one in which according to the spirit of the algorithm adopted in my system successive powers of A or of some functions of A  Philosophical Transactions 1807 p 125SIR J F W HERSCHEL ON A THEOREM OF DR BRINKLEY as V only occur applied all to one and the same power 0 and it only remains to develope the function of V we have arrived at in powers of A bearing in mind that V1 c or 1VAC   c Now as regards the term 1V it is obvious that it will take when developed the form AxPAyA2 c and therefore that when differentiated n1 times successively with respect to A it will have the form AlptAyA2 c so that when applied as an operative symbol to 0x the result will be 0 This term then may be simply struck out and we have only to consider the development in A of d n Sn o dV v Now this is equal to d nxnnxn1 V  I n O  dIv n n 12   xl IV  0R   00O  0  O  n xO  all the terms of which vanish

putting R t  the lastmentioned formula will be true if as regards the term which contains t we have RhiJ 1 R  1 RD 1 R2 l R n 1 1  I n    1n1 2 x 2 n  2 Rc the series on the righthand side being continued up to the term in Rt This formula et 1 is in fact true if R instead of being restricted to denote  denotes any function whatever of the form I tct2c  and it is true not only for the term in t but for all the powers of t not higher than tx And moreover R may denote any positive or negative integral or fractional power of R In fact the formula assuming for a moment the truth of it shows that the expansion of any power whatever of a series of the form in question can be obtained by means of the expansions of the successive positive integer powers of the same series the existence of such a formula at least for negative powers was indicated by EISENSTEIN Crelle t xxxix p 181 1850 and the formula itself in a slightly different form was obtained in a very simple manner by Professor SYLVESTER in his paper Development of an idea of EISENSTEIN Quart Math Journ t ip p 199 1855 the demonstration was in fact as follows viz writing R1R1 11 RlR  1c if we attend only to the terms involving powers of t not higher than t the series on the righthand side need only be continued up to the term involving R 1 and the right side being thus converted into a rational and integral function of R it may be developed in a series of powers of R the highest power being of course IR and the coefficients of the several powers are finite series which admit of summation this gives the required formula But there is an easier method the process shows that the series on the right hand side continued as above up to the term involving t is as regards n a rational and integral function of the degree x and by LAGRANGES interpolation formula any rational and integral function of n of the degree x can be at once expressed in terms of the values corresponding to x1 particular values of n The investigation will be as fol lows Let R denote a series of the form 1 b ct2c and let R denote the develop ment of the nth power of R continued up to the term containing tx the terms involving higher powers of t being rejected 1 R R2 c and generally Rs will in like man ner denote the developments of these powers up to the term involving tX or what is the same thing they will be the values of RE corresponding to n0 1 2s By what precedes R is a rational and integral function of n of the degree x and it can therefore be expressed in terms of the values R Ri 2  R which correspond to n0 1 2 x 322MR CAYLEYS NOTE ON THE FOREGOING PAPER 323 Let s have any one of the lastmentioned values then the expression nnln2na 1 ns ss12112Xs which as regards n is a rational and integral function of the degree x the factor ns which occurs in the numerator and in the denominator being of course omitted vanishes for each of the values n0 1 2x except only for the value ns in which case it becomes equal

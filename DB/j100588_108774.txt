AND FOR SUCCESSIVE INTEGRATIONS BY SIR J F W HERSCHEL BART FBS C RECEIVED APRIL 26READ JUNE 14 1860 IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR 1807 DR BRINKLEY HAS INVESTIGATED THE GENERAL VALUE OF THE COEFFICIENT OF ANY TERM IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNCTION I  AND HIS RESULT IS REMARKABLE FOR THE MODE OF ITS EXPRESSION IN TERMS OF THE SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENCES OF THE POWERS OF ZERO OR OF THE NUMBERS COMPRISED IN THE GENERAL EXPRESSION AM0 SINCE THAT TIME IN MY PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR 1815 ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS I HAVE EXHIBITED OTHER AND MUCH MORE SIMPLE AS WELL AS MORE EASILY CALCULABLE EXPRESSIONS FOR THE SAME COEFFICIENT BY MEANS OF THE SAME USEFUL AND VALUABLE DIFFERENCES AND IN THAT AND OTHER SUBSEQUENT MEMOIRS HAVE EXTENDED THEIR APPLICATION TO A VARIETY OF INTERESTING INQUIRIES IN THE THEORY OF DIFFERENCES AND SERIES IT IS SINGULAR HOWEVER THAT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME IT HAS NEVER BEEN SHOWN THAT THE FORMULAE OF DR BRINKLEY AND MY OWN THOUGH AFFORDING IN ALL CASES COINCIDENT NUMERICAL RESULTS ARE ANALYTICALLY RECONCILEABLE WITH EACH OTHER NOR INDEED IS IT AT ALL EASY TO SEE EITHER FROM THE COURSE OF HIS INVESTIGATION WHICH TURNS UPON AN INTRICATE APPLICATION OF THE COMBINATORY ANALYSIS OR FROM THE NATURE OF THE FORMULA ITSELF HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO PASS FROM THE ONE FORM OF EXPRESSION TO THE OTHER SO AS TO SHOW THEIR IDENTITY THIS IS WHAT I NOW PROPOSE REFERRING TO MY  COLLECTION OF EXAMPLES IN THE CALCULUS OF FINITE DIFFERENCES WILL BE FOUND THE FOLLOWING RELATION WHICH ENABLES US TO PASS FROM THE DIFFERENCES OF ANY ONE POWER OF ZERO AS 0 TO THOSE OF ANY OTHER AS 0 VIZ LOG L   NA0XX1  XN1 FA0 OR CHANGING X INTO XN LOG  LA FA0XNXLX2 XN FA0 AS THIS EQUATION IS GENERAL SO LONG AS NEGATIVE

THAT THE EXPANSION OF ANY POWER WHATEVER OF A SERIES OF THE FORM IN QUESTION CAN BE OBTAINED BY MEANS OF THE EXPANSIONS OF THE SUCCESSIVE POSITIVE INTEGER POWERS OF THE SAME SERIES THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A FORMULA AT LEAST FOR NEGATIVE POWERS WAS INDICATED BY EISENSTEIN CRELLE T XXXIX P 181 1850 AND THE FORMULA ITSELF IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FORM WAS OBTAINED IN A VERY SIMPLE MANNER BY PROFESSOR

herniary sack 2dly hernias by dila tation having two very distinct sacks Wherefore I judged that these observations deserved to be com municated to the Royal Society Read Dec 19 1751 I A hernia by rupture having nevertheless a sack On the 18th of February 1750 in giving a private course of operations to my English pupils on the body of one Lewis le Clerc a lad of eighteen years old a weaver of the parish of St Maclou I disco vered the hernia represented in the figure The apo neurosis of the musculus obliquus externus AA ran over the whole tumor BBC and intirely coverd it At the anterior and lateral internal part of this tumor was the ring DE lengthened into the shape of a per pendicular buttonhole which had nothing to close it but a cellular lamina of which g h are jags and which covered all this bag as being a continuation of the cellular membrana adiposa Through the above mentiond buttonhole appeared the cellular coat with which the peritonaeum furnishes the spermatic vesselsPhilos Trans Vol XLVII TABXV p 324 A A D G B G K g h E B J Mynde sculp325 vessels The intestine occupied the rest of this bag and at the bottom BE was contained the testicle which consequently had never taken the way of the ring to come out of the belly as it usually does but having passed on one side it had gradually pushed out the aponeurosis of the musculus obliquus externus and the intestine having followd it and broke the true lamina of the peritonaeum they had in concert formed this elongation At least this is the most natural explanation that I can give of this singu larity That the testicles are originally in the belly is a fact sufficiently known I have dissected faetuss in which I found them therein near the bladder It is pretty common to feel them in the rings in children and I have found them there even in lads of upwards of twenty years old II A hernia having two sacks Continuing the abovementiond course on the 5th of March 1750 I found in the body of Nicolas Janaux a batchelor of 48 years of age by trade a cloth worker of St Owen de Longpaon a rupture with a double herniary sack the first of which was formed by the expansion of the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus as in the preceding observation excepting that this expansion was only on the out ward side that the ring was in its usual place that the bottom of the bag formed by this expansion had some empty spaces where the expansion was want ing In a word the bag was neither as complete nor as thick as that of the foregoing observation but 3 on326 on the other hand there was a second bag inferredformedinferred as usual by the true lamella of the peritonaeum III Another sort of duplicity of the herniary sack Francis le Monnier coachman of the Rue St Laurent about 65 years of age had a rupture of long standing of the strangulation whereof I had already cured him in 1748 Having taken off his truss in order to get it mended he was seized with strangulation the 19th of Feb 1750 After apply ing all the remedies prescribed in such cases without success I was obliged to perform the operation on the 21st at eight in the evening Having laid the bag open in the usual manner which containd a little watry humour in it I was much surprised at discovering within this bag a second bag or pocket which could be nothing else but either a second herniary bag or an incomplete hernia that is to say a portion only of one side of an intestine elongated and come down thro the ring The number of considerable bloodvessels on this pocket its thickness and fibrous texture seemed to evince the latter But first upon pressing this bag all its contents returnd into the abdomen secondly the patient assured me even at the instant that his rup ture had kept up since its reduction in 1748 and I found this bag adhering not only to the first bag but also attached by old and strong adherences to the testicle and spermatic vessels and it was impossible that this state should be the effect of three days of strangulation However as the patient might possibly have327 have deceived me in his account and as it was dan gerous to open a bag which had too near a resem blance with the gut of an incomplete hernia I came to a resolution which equally suited the two sus pected cases I separated the testicle and spermatic vessels from this sack and pushed back this pocket or second bag into the belly The patient having died on the 9th day after the operation we found that the pocket which had given us so much uneasiness and which I had re duced into the belly was really a herniary sack formed by the true peritonaeum and therefore that the first sack must have been either an interior apo neurotic lamina of the abdominal muscles or the cellular membrane thickened by the long duration of the hernia and its strangulations The considerable thickness of the true or second sack renders this no tion very probable I say that the first sack must have been formed by an interior aponeurotic lamina and not from an exterior one like that of the first observation because in this operation I had freed the ring in my usual manner above this first sack and without opening it Then I passed the grooved catheter over this sack under the aponeurosis or pillar of the musculus obliquus externus and therefore this sack could not be a continuation of this external aponeurosis but that of some more inward lamina or of the cellular membrane of the very peritonaeum separated from the true lamina by the serosities which we found in it To this letter I will add two observations made about the same time I328 I A natural blind duct being a production of the true lamina of the peritonaeum by the rings March 5 1750 in the dead body of Magdalen Vauchel wife of Thomas Fermant 46 years old I found this duct of the thickness of a goosequill be a production of the true lamina of the peritonaeum stretched out by the rings of which Swammerdam and Nuck dispute the discovery and Blancard denies the existence What made me discover this was that its extremity was widend into the shape of a bubble as big as the top of a finger and full of a watery humour This woman had never had a her nia nor even the least tendency towards one II Strictures and carnosities in the urethra Nothing is more common at this day than to hear people assert that strictures and carnosities of the urethra are mere chimeras that the bodies of per sons who were thought to have these strictures and carnosities had been opend and that none of these had been found I myself have made this observa tion and I inferred thence that there were ure thras in which a phlogosis a fungous inflation gave occasion to the deception being taken for strictures and carnosities but if I had drawn this general in ference that of all the urethras wherein these stric tures and carnosities are thought to be found not one has any thing in them I should have been de ceived and would now make my recantation One329 One of my boarders preparing to perform the ope ration of cutting on the dead body of Michael Vassal a batchelor aged 45 the sound could not pass the pupil forced and made a false passage I opend this canal and found 1st That a simple small stile could not pass into the urethra by pushing it from the glans towards the prostate but that it passed by pushing it from the prostate towards the glans 2dly A little before the place where the bulb be comes less thick and begins to surround the urethra that is about a large fingers breadth from its begin ning there was a stricture intirely like that which Dr Willis discovered in the upper longitudinal sinus of the dura mater 3dly Some few lines lower down was a caruncle or a fleshy firm bump of the size of a pea and below this bump the urethra was extremely streight ened 4thly The basis of this carnosity formed a kind of valve and there I found the false passage that went into the substance of the bulb I have the honour to be S I R Your most humble and most obedient servant Le Cat T t LII

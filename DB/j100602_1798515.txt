THE Folinder s Gold Medal is awarded to Acllairal ALEXIS EOUTAKOFF for being the first to lannch and navigate ships in the Sea of Aral an achieveinent which led to the establishment of steamnavigation on that sea and up tho great River Jasartes into the heart of Ttlrkestan also for his subseqnent successful survey of the chief lnouths of the Osus in the Whanat of Rhiva The Patrons Gold ZIedal to Dr ISAAC I HAYES for his memorable expedition ill lS606l towards the open Polar Sea wherein he attained a more northern point of land in SlYlith Sound 81 3a than had been reached by any previolls navigator In presenting the BIedals the PRESIDENT first spoke as follows  IN estimating tlle advance of geographical knowledge it is obvious that our allies the Russians have by their numerous active scientific researches along and beyond their distant frontiers thlown quite a fresh light upon the physical structure and orography of Central Asia alld in my adclress of this day I shall dwell upon points relating to this subject which I have not touched upon at   sormer annlversarles 4 It is now my pleasing duty to announce that our Council has selected one of these explorers that enterprising naval officer Admiral Alexis Boutakoff who in the year 1852 transrnitted to us a lnodest account of his survey of the Sea of Aral as the recipient of our iFounderts AXedal CLhat irlland sea though unknown to the ancients was distinctly recognised by the Arabian geographers frozn the year 600 as the Sea of liwarezm In the middle and dark ages all knowledge of it was lost to the western world and it was not until Russia desirous of an accurate exploration of her Asiatic frontiels sent in 182S an expedition to examine its shores1 lRoyal AwczrdsBoufaAoff under General de Berg that any real acquaintance with its con dition was obtained  It was only howerer when ships built at Orenburg were trans ported in pieces across the wild steppes that Captain Alexis Bouta koff launched the filst flotilla on that sea and after two years of navitation ascertained its outlines and depth and the nature of the large islands within it  On a recent occasion Admiral Boutakof has also laid before us a sketch of his able examination of the mouths of tho Osus where that river empties itself into this inland sea Again it is still more important to dwell upon the other great services he has renderecl to his country and the civiliseel world in haa7ing proved that the Jaxaltes of the ancients the Syr Paria of the Asiatics which flows into the northern end of the Sea of Aral is a strealn which steamvessels can na7igate for upwards of 500 miles above its lnouth  It was by this discoery that a safe line of communication be tween Europe and China through AVestern Turkestan was first laid open to DEurope so that whilst Britain has had and holds her own high road to India and Chilla by the ocean Russia after trading overland for centuries with Western China under great difliculties owing to the intervention of barbarous and hostile tribes has at length opened out for helself a course along which by the interposition of small protective forts she will haxe a safo trade through Turkestan with the Celestial Elllpire AdI11iring as I do tha gleat progress made by Russians in ad vancinr our kllowledge of the geography of Central Asia I have a peculiar satisfaction in knowing that our Founders Medal has been decreed to one who is so good a tape of those enlightened explorers Tuloing to the Russian officer appointed to receive the medal the President continued Tllouh unable to be present himself I rejoice that his place is taken on this occasion by a distinguished brother officer of the Itupelial Bussian Navy and I therefore request you Captain Crown to convey this medal to Admiral Alexis Boutakoff as the expression of our admiration of his deeds Captain CROWN thus replied  Mr PRESIDENT I beg to return thanks to the Royal Geo graphical Society on behalf of Adlairal Boutakoff fol the honour they have conferred on him by axvarding him this Founders Medal Being mAself a member of the Impelial Bussian WavtT I cannot but feel proud at haxing been called upon by you Mr President to  CXll Sir RODERICE I 3tUPCHISON s Address perform the pleasant dllty of receiving from your hands this eviderree of the high appreciation of Adrniral BoutakoWs labouls by the Royal Geotraphical Society in a region whicll even at the present tilue is so very little linosvn to the scientific rorld The kind approval wrhich Aduliral BoutakofFs works llavc met at the hands of an Institution so widely known and esteemed in Ressia and of which you are Sir the honoured President will undoubtedly be a source of mettlal advantage in the callse of stince and will encourage our Russian geographers to seek a closer acquaintance with your Society by oSering their works in a arersicon laore accessible to English scientific readers than the Rtlssian langllage so that 5 ou will be better able to follow arld judge of the progress of geo graphical researches in Russa7 as carried oll by our sister institu tion in St Petersburg at the head of orhich as you are well aware is His Ilnperial Highness the Grand Duke Constantine I shall lose no time in forwarding to Admiral Boutakoff this AIedals and I only regret that I cannot express llis thanks to the Royal Geo graphical Society and to you Sir in so admirable a manner as he tlYould have done himself if he were here The PRESIDENT net addlessed the Hon C F Adams Blinister of the United States in the following wolds 4 MPW ADANSF Eleven years have elapsed since tlle Royal Geographical Society did honollr to itself by awarding a Gold AIedal to your highly distinguished countryluan the late Dr ILane for his discoveries in the Polar Regions A7hile in charge of an expedition generotlsly fitted out in the United States to search for Sir John Franklin and now I rejoice to saythat I have to ask you as the Representative of the great American Republic to receiare the hIedal of our Patron Queen Victoria which has been decerned to another of your countrylnen Dr Hayes br havina reached a more nolnthern pOillt of Arctic land 81 3S than ever was attained by any previous explorer  Forming one of the previous expedition of the lamented IVane mrho jllstly received the applause not only of your country but of the civilised world Dr Hayes was ort that occasion the discoverer of a large tnass of land forming the extreme westeln shore of Stnith Sound to which the nalne of 1Ienry Grinnell an ealightened citizen of New York the mainspring of that expeditionX was Inost appropriately attached It is for carrSring personal obser vations to a degree and a half further northxvard on land than on the previous occasion and for having sighted the open Iolal Sea from the western shore of IVeenedys stait just as lltS COLRoyal AupardsHayes e CSIll panion Mortoll had done from the eastern or Greenland shore of the same that our Council has lnost deservedly adjudicated to him our Patrons Medal  The scientific results of this expedition hanre been to a great extent tnade known in America and the Smithsonian Institution has ucldertaken the publication of those important additions to our acquaintance with the natural history terrestrial magnetisln and meteorology as well as the geography of the Arctic Regions  In the mean time the unpretending volume of our Aledallist entitled tlle Open Polar Sea is written in so clear manly axld attractive a style as must render it very popular among all readers in the British Isles and America  Just as mre know that ollr old Baffin first discovered and navigated in a very small craft the great bay separating Greenland from America with which his name has ever since been connected so the extremest point where these waters lead into what was called the  Open Polar Sea has been reached btr the small American schooner of Dr Hayes bearing tho name of the  United States  In perusing the narrative of the hairbreadth escapes of this little vessel when beset by hugie floating icebergs the skill with which she was lnanaged the stern resolution and ability with which every dfficultJr by sea or by land was overcome and the rich scientific fruits which were brought back with the loss only of the able AIr Sontag who made leost of the astronomical observa tions I may well congratulate your DExcelleney on the success of a voyage which will ever be lemembered among the lnany great exploits of your countrymen  I have now only to request you to convey this Victoria Medal to Dr Hayes with the request that he will accept it as the strongest proof we can oSer of our just appreciation of his great merits Mr ADAMS zeplied  Mr PRESIDENTIt gives me great pleasure to be the medium of presenting to Dr Hayes the honourable memorial which your Society has voted to hitn for his services in the cause of science It is no part of my province to undertake to saunt any of my countrynlen but I will say that in no part of the world will you find more people who watch with greater attention and adIniration the brave enterprises for public objects which are undertaken in any part of the wolld More espet ially by their natural connexion in all the essential elements of civilisation with this communit their attention is closelft drawn to every movement which takes VOL SXXVII hcnv Sir RODERIaE I MURCHISON S Address place here and following the admiration with which they see what has been done there grows a desire to emulate the same them selves It has been often objected to enterprises of this kind that they can lead to nothing that they are in their nature simply adventures in quest of things that are impossible But Mr Presi dent the same reinark might have heen lnade when olumbus first undertook his voyage to the West to what he did not know He thought he might come out somewhere in far Cathay but the result was as often happens in life an unexpected one and the unexpected turns out to be of greater proportions than anything which had been anticipated Thus it was that America was dis covered and the influence of that discovery upon the fortunes o the world reinains yet to be fully measured And so it has been with most of the adventures that have been started fronl the Old World for the discovery of that which was unknown Very often the explorers do not arrive at what was anticipated but then they atltain to a great deal which was not expected and 7hich has at the same time proved of very great value And more than that and greater than all this pursuit has led to the cultivation and develop rnent of high moral qualities in a class of men who become them selves greater heroes and greater benefactors to the interests of the world than most conquerors who have been lauded in the pages of history I therefore Mr President accept this Medal with great pleasure and I have no doubt that this marked testimony to the merits of one individllal will be felt not only by him but by all that class of individuals who at their own cost and expense carried on his enterprise It Xill anoreover stimulate them to repeat such efforts in emulation of your countrmen by which the bounds of science may still further be indefinitely estended

by Railway Trains 65 Experiments made at Watford on the Vibrations occasioned by Railway Trains passing through a Tunnel By Sir JAMES SOUTH LLD FRS c one of the Visitors of the Royal Ob servatory of Greenwich Received June 17 1863 In the year 1846 an attempt was made to obtain the consent of the Lords of the Admiralty to run a railway through Greenwich Park distant only 860 feet from the Royal Observatory which would in the opinion of many competent judges have been most injurious to that Establishmnent Such consent their Lordships refused but as I was assured on high au thority that this attempt was to be repeated and that too with the fullest confidence of success on the part of its projectors and supporters I deter mined to make experiments which might bear more decisively on the question of railway tremors as affecting that Observatory than those pre viously made by myself and others For this purpose it seemed indispensable that the station selected for making them should geologically resemble that of Greenwich and that the astronomical means employed to detect the existence and determine the intenisity of the tremors should be optically at least equal to the te lescope of the Greenwich Mural Circle As much importancewas attributed by the advocates of this railway to the supposed power of a tunnel to render the vibrations imperceptible it was also desirable that it should be one of the conditions of these trials Having but little more than a popular knowledge of geology I relied on my old and valued friend the late Mr Warburton who had recently been President of the Geological Society to guide me in the choice of a station and it was on his authority that I fixed on the Watford Tunnel and its im mediate vicinity There under a light gravelly soil of 18 or 20 inches deep lies a bed of gravel of considerable but variable thickness sometimnes compact at other times loose and immediately under it chalk with occasional flints The tunnel of which the bearing is 41 19t to NW of the meridian and by my measurement is 1812 yards long passes principally through chalk its arch is about 24 feet in diameter the crown of it being about 215 feet above the rails The thickness of the brickwork is about 18 inches the meani thickness of the chalk above the crown of the arch about 50 feet whilst that of the gravel though subject to great irre gularity may perhaps be regarded as 14 feet If so we have outside the tunnel above the horizontal plane of the rails 87 feet of chalk flint gravel and soil constituting an assemblage of which the power of transmitting tremors must be comparatively feeble There are five shafts in the tunnel four of which are circular 85 feet diameter and one quadrangular about 26 feet by 34  Read June 18 1863 see Abstract vol xii p 63066 Sir J South Vibrations caused by Railway 1863 The tuinnel runs under the park of the Earl of Essex and though I had not the honour of a personal acquaintance with the Noble Earl nor any introduction to him yet on learniing my objects he transmitted to me by return of post from Carlsbad a carteblanche to erect my observatory wherever I pleased though it were in the very heart of his choicest game preserves To him therefore is mainly due whatever benefit may accrue to science or to the Royal Observatory from the experiments recorded in this communication The point I selected was 302 yards distant from the centre of the line and the perpendicular from it on the axis of the tunnel meets that at a point 567 yards from the southern or London end of the tunnel 1245 yards from the Triing or north enzd and 594 5 from the fourth shaft This is the centre of the Observatory which I erected there it is of wood as small as is consistent with the necessary accommodation both for portability and that it might be less agitated by the wind It is quadrangular 12 feet by 10 and its length is in the meridian the eaves are 8 5 feet and the ridge of the roof 10 feet above the floor this lastbeing 4 iilches above the grounid which is nearly level with that over the tunnel The roof is covered with tarpaulins very well secured so as not to be torn by a gale of wiYd In the south and west sides are four wilndows which can be opened or shut at pleasure to light the Observatory by day or to see powder or other signals at night In the roof is no opening but in its northern side there is one which can be shut as required  it is little larger tihanwhat is absolutelynecessaryto allow the reflected rays from thePolestar to pass uninterruptedly to the observers eye through its whole revolutioni At its centre parallel with its sides and resting on the undisturbed gravel 4 feet below the surface is a mass of brickwork laid in excellent Roman cement 8 by 3 5 feet at bottom 7 by 35 at top its length ruinninlg east and west On this stand two piers of similar brickwork 18 inches by 14 and 46 inches higher than the floor they are capped by two Portland stones of similar horizontal section 8 inches thick In the interior faces of these stones are firmly fixed the Yplates which carry the Ys on which the in struments pivots rest Eighteen inches north of the brick massive but in the same plane with its base is the centre of the base of another pier brought up also in Roman cement 24 inches from N to S 18 from E to W and it rises 12 inches above the floor The upper surface is perfectly horizontal and serves to support a vessel which contains mercury Both this pier anid the massives are insulated from the floor and touch the ground only at their bases The mercuryvessel was 18 inches by 43 with its length in the meridiani The transitinstrument of the Campden Hill Observatory is far too pre cious to be exposed to the risks of such an expedition I therefore had one constructed which might be considered an excellent substitute The object glass which under favourable circumstances will bear a power of 1000 is 87 inches focus and 4 75 aperture The transverse axis is 31 inches and1863 Trains passing through a Tunnel 67 the Y has sufficient azimuthal motion to enable me to follow the Polestar in its whole course so that at any hour if clear I could have the reflected image of the star in the mercurial vessel ready to testify against the tre mors caused bv a train Supported by timber passing into the ground but unconnected with the floor and convenient to a writingdesk which occupies the SE angle of the building stands a journeyman clock It is set by my excellent gold pocket chronometer Molyneux No 963 and rarely deviates from that more than one or twotenths of a second in three or four hours The clock of the Watford Station was compared with the chronometer going and generally returning for the purpose of identifying particular trains These details will I hope suffice to prove that every precaution was taken to obtain accurate results and that those which I did obtain may be fairly considered as identical with what would have been found in a firstclass observatory under the same circumstances of locality and traffic I was at my post to commence observations on December 22nd 1846 but that and the three following nights were starless The 26th was fine but owing to the irregularity of the trains and the want of wellorganized signals I could only satisfy myself that all was in good working order and that the trains caused great disturbance For thirteen following nights I was at my post but in vain all was dark with the thermometer from 220 to 310 On January 11th 1847 it cleared and I observed seven trains with decisive results being able to announce their presence before it was known to my assistants who were on the watch outside the observatory The Polestars image as reflected from the mercurial surface when no train was near appeared As a very small perfectly steady disk thus  I wlhich as the train approached broke up into a quin    2 tuple thus As the disturbance increased the form be came linear at right angles to the length   eo O o   3 of the mercuryvessel thus    j 0 0 When the train was considerablyadvanced I  iu the tunnel a cross formed thus    4 And when near the perpendicular from the observatory three parallel lines of disks ap 000 5 peared thus j68 Sir J South Vibrations caused by Railway 1863 still parallel to No 3 As the tremors became more distant these trans formations of the image take place in a reverse order until the star resumes its original disklike form These results were strongly conspicuous even in a fully illuminated field and equally so whether the magnifying power was 60 200 or 750 The phenomena are very striking from the contrast between the smaller images which are blue while the larger ones are reddish and from the sudden way in which they break out The nights of the 13th and 14th were fine and so thoroughly confirmed my previous observations that I felt it my duty to lose no time in informing the late Lord Auckland then First Lord of the Admiralty of the preceding details and of my conclusions from them that a tunnel did not prevent great tremors from being propagated from it when a train was traversing it certainly to the distance of 643 yards and probably much fuLrther The impression which these facts made on his Lordship he expressed in the following letter Copy of a Letter from the Earl of Auckland to Sir James South Admiralty January 26th 1847  SInI have to return you many thanks for the very interesting report which you sent to me of your experiments upon the distance to which the vibration caused by steamcarriages within a tunnel extend and I cannot but admire the enterprise and ability with which these expe riments were conducted They would be quite conclusive if the question of carrying a tunnel through Greenwich Park were again to be agitated I am very faithfully yours  To Sir James South A e Syc AUCKLAND The reserve with which I spoke of that further distance arose from the circumstance that I was not in possession of the exact measurements of the tunnel and the position of its shafts I had twice applied for them in vain to the railway authorities and was obliged at last to execute the measures myself  This consumed some time and the observations were not com pletely resumed till February 24 1847 The process was this About 600 yards before the entrance of the tunnel a rocket was fired as a signal for attention At the instant that the engine passed the south end of the tunnel one of Lord Essexs gamekeepers fired one barrel of his gun and the other about a second after which was necessary to distinguish this from the shots of poachers who were often at  This delay was not occasioned by any want of courtesy on the part of the Directors or other officers from whom especially from Mr Creed their Secretary I received the heartiest cooperation He not only directed all the officers along the line to aid as far as possible my investigations but pressed on me free passes for myself and my assistants I was also indebted to Captairn Bruyeres for the character of the trains and to Mr Sttubbs the Superintendent of the Watford Station for the zeal with which he followed out the Secretarys instructions at much personal inconvenience1863 Trains passing through a Tunnel 69 work around me Similar shots were fired when the engine was at the centre of the 4th shaft which could be seen from above The times of these sig nals were taken by an assistant During this time I was at the telescope anid noticed the second when any peculiar phase of disturbance appeared The computation of the distance of the engine from the eye at a given time is very simple From the known distance of the south end of the tunnel and the 4th shaft from the eve we know the times taken by the sound of the gun to reach the observatory The temperature was during the whole series so near 32 that the velocity of sound for that temperature 363 13 yards may be used without sensible error The effect of wind must also have been insensible Hence the signal from the south entrance was 15 77 too late that from the shaft 1984 Correcting the times and dividing by their difference the distance of the shaft from the entrance 162 yards we have the velocity of the train which however I have given in miles per hour as affording a more familiar measure of the disturbing power Then the difference of the time of phase and corrected time of entrance gives the place of the engine on the line and the perpendicular is given In the following record of the observations the first column contains the number the second the times the third the facts observed and the fourth gives the distance then follow occasional remarks In the disturbances I specially recorded as most definite the cross 4 and the arrangement of bars of parallel stars 5 The slighter disturbances which precede or follow the former were seldom entered though quite sensible 1847 February 24I No Time Observations Yards Remarks h m s I 7 I8 43 Cross very

importalnt of them into the preceding Table which gives in one view the distance at which that amount of disturbance begins and ends which produces the cross that at which the far greater one occurs causing the appearance 5 a system of three or more parallel rows wherever it does appear and the velocities and weights of the trains when known It is evident from this Table that the tremor which is sufficient to produce that disturbance of the mercury which shows a cross of stars is propagated to considerable distancesin one case to 11 76 yards and 24 per cent of the entire are above 1000 Such distances do not pass the northern end of the tuninel but go far beyond the southern In the latter case the vibrations are excited while the train is in arn open cutting and those wbo suppose that the tinnel has much power in deadening them would of course expect that they would be sensible at a greater distance than at the other end This does not seem however to be the case and the Table shows that in this respect there is very little difference if we take into account another cause of inequality namely that the tremor is manifested further at the exit than at the entrance of the train The column headed Exit  shows by s thatthe exit was at the South end and the entrance at the North Now when the observations are examined where both were noted we find that the limit of the cross is greater at the exit than at the entrance in 29 out of 39 or 74 per cent of s and 12 out of 16 or 75 per cent of N The reason of this I suppose is that the longcontinued action of the train on the rails tends to produce a greater and more prolonged undulation in the mercury But the equal percentage shows that there is really no protecting power in the tunnel against the lateral propagation of tremors whatever may be the case immediately above the crown In general one might expect trains to produce disturbance in proportion to their speed and their weight To a certain degree this is true but the exceptions are sufficient to show that other influences must be taken into consideration Examples of high speed with comparatively small effect are afforded by the observations on March 18 II  19 III and 29 V Others of the reverse conditions are given by February 24 I II March 18 VI and specially March 16 III in which with a velocity of only 11 4 miles the cross was shown at 1110 yards This it may be remarked is a decisive proof that any plan of protecting an observatory by slackening the speed of trains passing near it is entirely useless even if it could be enforced It is probable that one cause of this high disturbingpower in slow trains is that already referred to the longcontinued accumulation of vibration the quick ones passing beyond distance before the mercury has got into full vibration the others havirng full time to do their work though with less intrinsic force On this account also long trains are mnore disturbing than short82 Sir J South Vibrations caused by Railway 1863 The engine is not so paramount a disturber as might be expectedthe heaviest and even a pair of them not causing more tremor than occurs with the smaller ones In taking the cross of stars as the test of disturbance I must observe that I do so not because it is the earliest which appears but because it marks distinctly an agitation greater than what is likely to occur at an observa tory subject to ordinary perturbations These produce in such a mercuiry vessel as I used a single line of stars perpendicular to the length of the vessel It should seem that then only one set of undulations fit to produce these images is excited in the mercury the direction of which is regulated by the sides of the vessel  The existence of the cross shows that a secolnd set of waves perpelndicular to the first has been developed this always happens if the sides of the vessel are equal and its occurring when they are so un equal as in the present case seems to indicate a corresponding excess of the power which causes them If the agitation be still greater it seems as if each of the images which form the cross became the origini of a row of secondary images the result of which is the form 5 a series of parallel rows of stars varying from two to ten or even filling the whole field This token of ultra disturbance is confined between lines making angles of 45 with the per pendicular to the railsin other words to distances under 427 yards and when the train is nearly in the centre of the tunnel It is except in two instances only seen when the cross is visible beyond 1000 vards when the agitation is still further increased the images vibrate in every direction and with yet more of it the whole becomes a mass of nebulous light of both which some examples may be found in these observations The opinion maintained by the late Mr Robert Stephenson that much of these railway tremors were due to the sound of the train although not probable induced me to try some experiments by firing cannon maroons and rockets at various distances One of these cannons for I had two each  of a pound calibre heavily loaded at 300 yards produced 5 cross and line simultaneously with my hearing the reports but all disturbance was over in about 15 second At 2020 yards there was the cross synchronous with the report and of the same momentary character and even at 3000 yards the cross could be traced This seems to have been due to the momentary impulse of the soundwave for the continuous roar of twopound rockets fired at 82 feet from the mercury though very loud disturbed it very little while the ex plosions of eight ounces of powder in their heads about 800 yards above the ground produced all the 5 cross and line A still more interesting expe riment was firing the cannon in the tunnel at the point where the perpen dicular from the observatory met it In this case two disturbances were seenone propagated through the ground the other through the air with about a second of time interval The sound probably nmade its way chiefly  For details on this I may refer to my Report to the Admiralty published by order of the House of Commons July 6 18461864 Extract of a Letter from Dr Otto Torell 83 through the shafts but even had they been closed it seems unquiestionable that the report andl of course the sound of a train would travel through the earth  I should have prosecuted these researches further especially in reference to the velocity with which these tremors are propagated through the ground but that Lord Aucklands letter to me led mne to hope that all danger to the Royal Observatory was past never to return I therefore contented myself with reducing the observations I had made As how ever the Railway Moloch seems never likely to be satiated with victims and as the observatories of Oxford Armagh and again that of Greenwich have been marked for sacrifice it seems to me a duty to place before the public the facts which had been collected at a great expense of labournand some pecuniary outlay They were made without any bias or any motive but a desire to ascertaini the actual truth and in addition to their bearing on practical astronomy I hope that they may not be without use in reference to some other depart ments of science An interesting fact was observed with the maroons They were fired vertically from a mortar twenty feet from the observatory and had fuses which gave them flight for six seconds The mercury showed the usual intense disturbance when the mortar was fired and also at the explosion of the maroons in the air But there was also an initerrnediate disturbance which I cannot explain but by supposing it to be as it were an eclio of the earthwave caused by the dischlarge of the mortar and reflected from the masonzry of the tunnel I showed it to the Marquis of Blandford to Lord Alfred Churchill anid to Pro fessor James MeCullagh unfortunately the nights Dr Robiinson and Mr Warburton ac companied me to Watford not a sinle star was visible On repeating the experiments at Campdeni Hill notliing of the sQrt occurred VOL XIII il

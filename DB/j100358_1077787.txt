MORE OF THEIR CLASSES AS WORK SHOPS OR LABORATORIES IN WHICH THEY WORK INCIDENTALLY AT LEAST UPON THEIR OWN INSTRUCTIONAL PROBLEMS AN INNOVATING METHOD EVEN IF PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL IS LIKELY TO SATISFY A TEACHERS OWN DESIRE FOR GROWTH MORE THAN AN ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE DELIBERATELY BREAKING THE CRUST OF CUSTOM NOT IN ALL NOT PERHAPS IN MANY BUT IN SOME OF ONES CLASSES ADDS INTEREST FOR BOTH INSTRUCTOR AND PUPILS MOREOVER IT ASSURES THE TEACHERS GROWTH ENGLISH COMPOSITION CLASSES OFFER EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ON PAGES 85 TO 100OO OF THIS ISSUE APPEARS A MODEST

GENERAL EXCELLENCE AND MECHANICAL EXCELLENCE IN THE COMPOSITIONS OF HIGHSCHOOL FRESHMEN THE AMOUNT 124EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT I25 OF CORRELATION FOUND IN THAT STUDY IS SET FORTH AS A HYPOTHESIS WHICH NEEDS SUBSTANTIATING OR CORRECTING WHEN MORE DATA SHALL HAVE BEEN EXAMINED OTHER QUESTIONS UPON WHICH SIMILAR STUDIES MIGHT BE MADE READILY SUGGEST THEMSELVES FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF A FIVEMINUTE PERIOD OF PRELIMINARY THINKING BEFORE A PUPIL BEGINS TO WRITE  WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF SIMPLE AS CONTRASTED WITH ELABORATE OUTLINES  WHAT MECHANICAL ERRORS AND HOW MANY CAN HIGHSCHOOL FRESHMEN DETECT IN THEIR OWN WORK IN PROOFREADING PERIODS  WHAT IS THE EFFECT UPON SPON TANEITY OF VARIOUS KINDS OF TOPICS  THE SCHOOL REVIEW URGES HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPALS TO SET SOME OF THEIR ENGLISH TEACHERS TO WORK UPON ONE OR MORE PROBLEMS LIKE THESE MORE OVER THE EDITORS OFFER TO PUBLISH THE DATA OF SUCH STUDIES IF LIMITED TO FOUR PAGES THE UNITED STATES BOYS WORKING RESERVE THE LABOR SHORTAGE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE WORLDWAR IS COMING TO BE ONE OF ACUTE PROBLEMS WITH WHICH AMERICA MUST DEAL THIS SHORTAGE WILL BE THE MORE KEENLY FELT AS SPRING ADVANCES AND HEAVY DEMANDS ARE MADE UPON AGRICULTURAL LABOR IN AN EFFORT TO PRODUCE RECORD CROPS TO FEED THE NATIONS AT WAR THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS SENSED THIS PROBLEM AND HAS ALREADY SET IN MOTION MACHINERY LOOKING TO THE UTILIZATION OF THE FULL MAN POWER OF THE COUNTRY IN AN EFFORT TO MEET THE SITUATION THE UNITED STATES BOYS WORKING RESERVE IS THE ORGANIZED EXPRESSION OF THIS EFFORT THIS ORGANIZATION IS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AT WASHINGTON WITH A NATIONAL DIRECTOR MR WILLIAM E HALL AND STATE DIRECTORS IN EACH OF THE STATES OF THE UNION THESE STATE ORGANIZA TIONS ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE COUNCILS OF DEFENSE WITH BRANCH ORGANIZATIONS IN EACH COUNTY THE UNITED STATES BOYS WORKING RESERVE WAS ORGANIZED FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF AIDING IN THE WAR BY GUARANTEEING THE NECESSARY FARM HELP TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IT WAS CLEARLY SEEN THAT THE ONE GREAT SOURCE FROM WHICH TO DRAW AGRICULTURAL LABORERS FOR THIS EMERGENCY WAS FROM THE RANKS OF OUR BOYS BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS OF AGE IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 2000000 OF THESE YOUNG MEN IN THE UNITED STATES WHO CAN AND WILL QUALIFY FOR THIS SERVICE THEY ARE PHYSICALLY FIT LOYAL INTERESTED IN DOING THEIR PART AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL ARE INTELLIGENT AND ADAPTABLE TO EMERGENCY NEEDS GERMANY HAS USED THOUSANDS OF SUCH BOYS AND THE UNITED STATES CAN MATCH HER TWO TO ONE THE SLOGAN THIS YEAR IS TO BE  EVERY BOY BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY A MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES BOYS WORKING126 THE SCHOOL REVIEW RESERVE AND EVERY MEMBER ENGAGED IN SOME PROFITABLE AND NECESSARY OCCUPATION LAST YEAR THOUSANDS OF CITY BOYS WERE SENT TO FARMS OVER THE COUNTRY IN AN EFFORT TO SUPPLY NEEDED LABOR THESE BOYS WENT OUT UNDER UNFAVOR ABLE CONDITIONS OF PLACEMENT AND SUPERVISION WITHOUT TRAINING AND FOR THE MOST PART WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING OF THE DEMANDS TO BE MADE UPON THEM IN THEIR WORK AS FARM LABORERS IT IS SURPRISING THAT SO LARGE A PERCENTAGE OF THESE BOYS MADE GOOD THIS YEAR THE RESERVE EXPECTS TO BENEFIT BY THE MORE OR LESS UNORGANIZED EFFORTS OF LAST SEASON AND WITH A VIEW TO INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WORK SOME VERY INTERESTING SCHEMES OF ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN SOME STATES INTENSIVE TRAINING CAMPS ARE BEING ESTABLISHED FARM PLATTS BURGS WHERE THE BOYS ARE TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER FOR FROM TEN DAYS TO TWO WEEKS INTENSIVE TRAINING IN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF FARM WORK BEFORE BEING SENT TO THE FARMER FOR ACTUAL SERVICE AFTER THE PERIOD OF TRAINING HAS BEEN COMPLETED THE BOYS ARE TO BE SENT OUT IN GROUPS OF FROM TWENTY TO THIRTY TO WORK IN A GIVEN COMMUNITY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A COM PETENT BOY LEADER IN SOME CASES THE GROUP IS TO WORK OUT FROM A FARM CAMP BUT IN MANY PLACES THE BOYS ARE TO LIVE IN THE HOMES OF THE FARMERS MANY STATES HAVE NOT SEEN THEIR WAY CLEAR TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN THE RATHER EXPENSIVE TRAINING CAMP PREFERRING TO CARRY ON SUCH TRAINING THROUGH THE ALREADYESTABLISHED TRAINING AGENCIES SUCH IS THE CASE IN ILLINOIS WHERE AN EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO ENROL YOUNG MEN IN PRELIMINARY TRAINING COURSES TO BE CONDUCTED IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS OF THE STATE SUCH TRAINING COURSES WILL BE OF A VERY PRACTICAL NATURE AND ARE INTENDED TO INTRODUCE THE CITY BOY TO MANY OF THE ESSENTIALS OF FARM LIFE AND FARM WORK IN THIS CONNECTION THEY WILL BE TAUGHT TO CARE FOR HORSES AND OTHER FARM ANIMALS AND TO ADJUST OPERATE AND REPAIR COMMON FARM MACHINERY SUCH COURSES ARE INTENDED NOT ONLY TO AID IN MAKING ADJUSTMENT TO THE ACTUAL WORK ON THE FARM BUT TO AFFORD A FOUNDATION FOR THE INTERPRETATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF FARM LIFE THE LEADERS OF THIS MOVEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN DELUDED BY THE BELIEF THAT INEXPERIENCED CITY BOYS CAN BE MADE TO TAKE THE PLACE OF EXPERIENCED FARM HANDS THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT EXPERIENCED FARM HANDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND WILL BE LESS AND LESS AVAIL ABLE AS TIME GOES ON THE FARMER IS FACE TO FACE WITH A SITUATION WHICH MEANS THE UTILIZATION OF A SUBSTITUTE WILL HE ACCEPT THE SERVICES OF UNSKILLED UNRELIABLE CITY TRANSIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN FAILURES IN EVERY OTHER INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY OR WILL HE TAKE HIS CHANCES WITH AN INTELLIGENT INTERESTED VIGOROUS CITY BOY WHO HAS BEEN GIVEN A LITTLE INSIGHT INTO THEEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 127 MEANING OF FARM WORK  THE CHANCES ARE THAT THE AMERICAN FARMER WILL PIN HIS HOPES TO THE YOUNG MANHOOD OF THE COUNTRY THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THE RESPONSE OF THE AMERICAN BOYS TO THE CALL TO SERVICE AT THIS TIME THEIR RESPONSE MEANS AN ADDED RESPONSI BILITY FOR THE SCHOOLS AND FOR THOSE REGULARLY TRAINED FOR AND ENGAGED IN THE WORK OF SUPERVISION AND LEADERSHIP THE BOYS WHO LEAVE THE CITY TO ASSUME THEIR DUTIES AS FARM LABORERS ARE FOR THE MOST PART UNACCUSTOMED TO FULL PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY THEY ARE LEAVING THE HOME INFLUENCE AND ENTERING A NEW AND STRANGE HOME AND ENVIRONMENT AND THE READJUSTMENT CALLED FOR SHOULD BE MADE ONLY UNDER CAREFUL SUPERVISION IN THE FIRST PLACE THIS SUPERVISION SHOULD MEAN PLACEMENT IN THE RIGHT KIND OF HOME IN THE SECOND PLACE IT SHOULD MEAN INCREASED POSSIBILITIES FOR EFFICIENT SERVICE FURTHERMORE THE RIGHT KIND OF SUPERVISION SHOULD INSURE AN INTENSIVE AND VITAL EDUCATIONAL REACTION TO THE LIFE IN THE RURAL COMMUNITY HALLOWEEN AND CHORAL GROUPS THE SCHOOL REVIEW HAS RECENTLY SEEN NO MORE SENSIBLE CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION FOR DIRECTING THE SURPLUS ENERGIES OF YOUNG PEOPLE AT A TIME WHEN YOUTH CALLS TO MISCHIEF THAN THE FOLLOWING ANNOUNCEMENT TO AVOID THE CUSTOMARY DISORDERS THAT ARE APT TO MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN CITIES TOWNS AND COUNTRY PLACES ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT SUPERINTENDENT HOBAN OF DUNMORE INTRODUCED THE NEW AND NOVEL METHOD OF OBSERVING THE OCCASION BY ORGANIZING THE FOUR HIGHSCHOOL CLASSES

UNSTINTED IN ITS PRAISE OF THE INNOVATION SCHOOL MUSIC A CHANCE TO HELP TO PRINCIPALS OF SECONDARY GRADES IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY OF MUSICAL TALENT IN CHILDREN AND TEACHERS THE UNDERSIGNED IS UNDERTAKING THE PREPARATION OF A REPORT DEALING WITH THE FOLLOWING TWO QUESTIONS I WHAT SHALL WE DO IN THE FIRST EIGHT GRADES OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO CLASSIFY CHILDREN FOR THE EXERCISES IN SINGING ON THE BASIS OF ABILITY IN SINGING RATHER THAN ON THE BASIS OF CLASS IN THE REGULAR GRADE  2 WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MEANS BY WHICH WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT SINGING IN THE GRADES SHALL BE TAUGHT BY TEACHERS WHO HAVE NATURAL ABILITY IN SINGING  I TAKE THIS INFORMAL MANNER OF ADDRESSING THOSE PRINCIPALS WHO BELIEVE THAT SUCH ADJUSTMENT IS DESIRABLE AND POSSIBLE AND MOST EARNESTLY128

Hotels THE DATE February 26 THE TIME Sixthirty PM THE GUESTS All alumni and former students of The University of Chicago THE TOPIC War Activities of the University This gathering of the University family an annual affair in connec tion with the meeting of the Department of Superintendence offers an excellent opportunity for renewing acquaintances and keeping in touch with the life and progress of the University Several faculty members will be in attendance You are requested to reserve tickets in advance by writing to Dean W S Gray at the University inclosing check for 2 00 If you are unable to do this please be sure to leave your request at the desk of The Breakers before noon of Tuesday the twentysixth EXPERIMENT STATIONS FOR HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS Progressive teachers look upon one or more of their classes as work shops or laboratories in which they work incidentally at least upon their own instructional problems An innovating method even if partially successful is likely to satisfy a teachers own desire for growth more than an entirely successful standardized procedure Deliberately breaking the crust of custom not in all not perhaps in many but in some of ones classes adds interest for both instructor and pupils moreover it assures the teachers growth English composition classes offer exceptional opportunities On pages 85 to 100oo of this issue appears a modest attempt to demonstrate how any teacher of English may go to work upon a constructive study in her own field The article undertakes to establish on the basis of con crete data a relationship between general excellence and mechanical excellence in the compositions of highschool Freshmen The amount 124EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT I25 of correlation found in that study is set forth as a hypothesis which needs substantiating or correcting when more data shall have been examined Other questions upon which similar studies might be made readily suggest themselves For example what is the effect of a fiveminute period of preliminary thinking before a pupil begins to write  What are the effects of simple as contrasted with elaborate outlines  What mechanical errors and how many can highschool Freshmen detect in their own work in proofreading periods  What is the effect upon spon taneity of various kinds of topics  The School Review urges highschool principals to set some of their English teachers to work upon one or more problems like these More over the editors offer to publish the data of such studies if limited to four pages THE UNITED STATES BOYs WORKING RESERVE The labor shortage brought about by the worldwar is coming to be one of acute problems with which America must deal This shortage will be the more keenly felt as spring advances and heavy demands are made upon agricultural labor in an effort to produce record crops to feed the nations at war The national government has sensed this problem and has already set in motion machinery looking to the utilization of the full man power of the country in an effort to meet the situation The United States Boys Working Reserve is the organized expression of this effort This organization is under the direction of the Department of Labor at Washington with a national director Mr William E Hall and state directors in each of the states of the Union These state organiza tions are under the jurisdiction of the state councils of defense with branch organizations in each county The United States Boys Working Reserve was organized for the express purpose of aiding in the war by guaranteeing the necessary farm help to increase agricultural production It was clearly seen that the one great source from which to draw agricultural laborers for this emergency was from the ranks of our boys between sixteen and twenty years of age It has been estimated that there are at least 2000000 of these young men in the United States who can and will qualify for this service They are physically fit loyal interested in doing their part and most important of all are intelligent and adaptable to emergency needs Germany has used thousands of such boys and the United States can match her two to one The slogan this year is to be  Every boy between sixteen and twenty a member of the United States Boys Working126 THE SCHOOL REVIEW Reserve and every member engaged in some profitable and necessary occupation Last year thousands of city boys were sent to farms over the country in an effort to supply needed labor These boys went out under unfavor able conditions of placement and supervision without training and for the most part without knowing anything of the demands to be made upon them in their work as farm laborers It is surprising that so large a percentage of these boys made good This year the Reserve expects to benefit by the more or less unorganized efforts of last season and with a view to increasing the efficiency of the work some very interesting schemes of organization and administration have been developed In some states intensive training camps are being established farm Platts burgs where the boys are to be brought together for from ten days to two weeks intensive training in the fundamentals of farm work before being sent to the farmer for actual service After the period of training has been completed the boys are to be sent out in groups of from twenty to thirty to work in a given community under the supervision of a com petent boy leader In some cases the group is to work out from a farm camp but in many places the boys are to live in the homes of the farmers Many states have not seen their way clear to establish and maintain the rather expensive training camp preferring to carry on such training through the alreadyestablished training agencies Such is the case in Illinois where an effort is being made to enrol young men in preliminary training courses to be conducted in the high schools of the state Such training courses will be of a very practical nature and are intended to introduce the city boy to many of the essentials of farm life and farm work In this connection they will be taught to care for horses and other farm animals and to adjust operate and repair common farm machinery Such courses are intended not only to aid in making adjustment to the actual work on the farm but to afford a foundation for the interpretation and understanding of farm life The leaders of this movement have not been deluded by the belief that inexperienced city boys can be made to take the place of experienced farm hands That is not the question The fact of the matter is that experienced farm hands are not available and will be less and less avail able as time goes on The farmer is face to face with a situation which means the utilization of a substitute Will he accept the services of unskilled unreliable city transients who have been failures in every other industrial activity or will he take his chances with an intelligent interested vigorous city boy who has been given a little insight into theEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 127 meaning of farm work  The chances are that the American farmer will pin his hopes to the young manhood of the country There is no question about the response of the American boys to the call to service at this time Their response means an added responsi bility for the schools and for those regularly trained for and engaged in the work of supervision and leadership The boys who leave the city to assume their duties as farm laborers are for the most part unaccustomed to full personal responsibility They are leaving the home influence and entering a new and strange home and environment and the readjustment called for should be made only under careful supervision In the first place this supervision should mean placement in the right kind of home In the second place it should mean increased possibilities for efficient service Furthermore the right kind of supervision should insure an intensive and vital educational reaction to the life in the rural community HALLOWEEN AND CHORAL GROUPS The School Review has recently seen no more sensible constructive suggestion for directing the surplus energies of young people at a time when youth calls to mischief than the following announcement To avoid the customary disorders that are apt to manifest themselves in cities towns and country places on Halloween Night Superintendent Hoban of Dunmore introduced the new and novel method of observing the occasion by organizing the four highschool classes into singing groups These groups visited the various sections of the city serenading the people Every corner in the borough was covered the singing starting at 7 30 and lasting until Io The public was unstinted in its praise of the innovation SCHOOL MUSIC A CHANCE TO HELP To Principals of Secondary Grades in the Public Schools As a result of the study of musical talent in children and teachers the undersigned is undertaking the preparation of a report dealing with the following two questions i What shall we do in the first eight grades of the public schools to classify children for the exercises in singing on the basis of ability in singing rather than on the basis of class in the regular grade  2 What are some of the means by which we can guarantee that singing in the grades shall be taught by teachers who have natural ability in singing  I take this informal manner of addressing those principals who believe that such adjustment is desirable and possible and most earnestly128 THE SCHOOL REVIEW request the favor of a letter before March I stating either what their schools are doing to meet this situation or what they propose to do Statements discouraging such effort with assigned reasons are equally desired The aim is not to get statistics but rather to get a record of progress and immediate aims Awaiting generous cooperation by prompt response I am Yours in the interest of the cause C E SEASHORE STATE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA IOWA CITY IOWA WORKING ONES WAY AT HAYS NORMAL Scattered throughout the country there are institutions which enable students to earn almost all and in some cases quite all of their keep while attending college Baker University and Valparaiso in the Middle West immediately come to mind as examples Announcement comes from Fort Hays Normal Kansas that all one needs to secure a college education is transportation to that institution Through the depart ment of agriculture Fort Hays says to the young people of western Kan sas Have enough money to get on the campus If you will farm garden milk cows churn butter raise chickens slop pigs peel potatoes wash dishes or keep bees you can get your college education Students may enrol under any one of nine projects in gardening field crops dairy pigs poultry creamery greenhouse gardening bees or students dininghall projects During the past year gardening has been the most popular project by which sixtytwo students of whom twelve are girls earned their way through college Garden crops were saved from the hot winds by two irrigation stations which pumped thousands of gallons of water between the rows of growing vegetables Fiftyfive acres of the campus grounds were allotted to irrigation gardening Last years crops in order of extent of cultivation were Potatoes sweet corn beans cantaloupes tomatoes onions sweet potatoes watermelons celery cabbage radishes lettuce turnips spinach and pumpkins Many persons from the surrounding towns motored to Hays and bought garden stuffs from the students There are no downtown boardinghouses or boardinghouses for students of Hays Normal The students all eat at the students dininghall This pro ject is promoted by fortyone students who feed the students for 350 per week make their own living expenses and have a small margin left above expenses Owing to the need of boys in the field this project is limited entirely to girlsEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 129 The gross production of the eight producing projects amounted during the fiscal year to 24627 This was produced by 124 students making an average gross income of 19850 for each student The 124 students produced 4263 worth of food over and above their own consumption Two BITS A WEEK Out in Phoenix Arizona there has been instituted a TwoBits a Day Club the members of which are to buy a quarters worth of thrift stamps every day For a trial three men each took a hundred thrift cards pasted one stamp on each card and sold the entire lot before they had covered two blocks Two bits the western colloquialism for a quarter of a dollar is a term which remains very popular It may even be made an attractive advertisement for urging highschool pupils to become partners with the government in financing the war Let an enterprising principal whose pupils are not already in very large numbers buying thrift stamps urge the formation of a twobits a week club Instead of doing ones bit each pupil may be urged to do two bits The excellence of the cause will excuse the atrocity of the pun Two billion dollars is a large sum The government needs it before in the spring the anticipated third Liberty Loan is launched More than that every child needs to feel his partnership Two bits to start with Least and last begin the habit of saving The United States is behind every other nation in the world in thrift and ahead in prodigality We are an easy come easy go people Take advantage of the lessons of the war and the necessity of the hour Teach thrift LESSONS IN COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LIFE The December lessons of this series which is now being published by the United States Bureau of Education again emphasize the under lying educational purpose of the series In convenient compact and attractive form actual materials dealing with community and national life are put into the hands of the children For example the December lesson for upper grades and junior high school has for its subject How Men Have Put Heat to Work The lesson reviews the use of animals wind and water as sources of power This is followed by accounts of Saverys pumping device the first steam engine of 1698 Newcomens piston engine of 1705 Humphrey Potters automatic pumping engine and James Watts steam engine130 THE SCHOOL REVIEW which replaced the alternating heat and cold method of earlier types by the separate condenser Telephones and telegraph are also described as machines for overcoming space and their part in modern industry is emphasized The work of women is considered with special reference to the changes caused by the transfer of production from home to factory Under the heading The Impersonality of Modern Life this section of the lessons compares modern city life with the more intimate life of the small village analyzes the large business corporation of the present day and suggests the need of new standards of conduct and new points of contact between human beings For pupils in the intermediate grades of the elementary schools inventions is the subject taken up in the December issue The roll of inventions is called from the simple traps and weapons of primitive men to the printing and telegraphy of today Iron and steel are treated his torically and the modern processes are described whereby smelting is made easier and cheaper than ever before Other lessons in this section have to do with the effects of machinery on rural life and patents and inventions Special attention is given to the farm tractor which besides its uses in increasing production makes possible the movement of heavy trench guns and furnished the principle from which have been developed the famous tanks used by the British Army in France The Lessons in Community and National Life are sold to schools at cost by the government In all eight numbers of each section will be issued one number appearing on the first of each calendar month through May The Government Printing Office is able to furnish these texts in large quantities for school use the cost in quantities of a thousand or more amounting to less than a cent a month for each pupil or eight cents for the entire series ENLARGED EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY OF THE HIGH SCHOOL Robert J Aley president of the University of Maine and president recently of the National Education Association at the close of an address delivered last month before the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools summed up the enlarged opportunity of the high school He insisted that the high schools should i Weed out the teachers of doubtful loyalty 2 Where necessary shorten terms and change vacation periods 3 Use the plant and equipment for afternoon and evening schools 4 In manual training and vocational departments make useful products 5 Provide short courses in certain subjectsEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 13I 6 Emphasize the study of French and Spanish rather than German 7 Teach history and government so as to emphasize our relations to Englishspeaking and democratic peoples 8 Teach a larger faith so as to reduce credulity 9 Give a right perspective on the origin and development of knowledge and culture ANALYTICAL REPORTS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS The University High Schools of the University of Minnesota and the University of Chicago are using forms for detailed reports on the habits of work abilities and special traits of individual pupils These are filled out by each teacher for all pupils to whom he is giving instruction Copies of these forms are given below UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA HIGH SCHOOL 0o 2 3 4 5 i Accuracy 2 Candor  3 Capacity to attend 4 Cheerfulness  5 Cooperation  6 Courtesy  7 Courage  8 Endurance  9 Honesty  o0

intelligence ON REVERSE SIDE OF CARD Please grade   on the 24 character istics listed on the reverse side of this card The grade should be made on a basis of five points If the person appears to you as average ie as possessing the character istic as you would expect it to appear in 50 persons out of ioo give a grade of 3 Give a grade of 5 only when the person possesses the characteristic in so high a degree132 THE SCHOOL REVIEW as you expect it in 5 persons out of ioo Use i to indicate the other extreme and 2 and 4 for degrees of the characteristics between the average and the extremes

diffident sincere insincere persistent not persistent cheerful not cheerful honest dishonest wellpoised not wellpoised loyal disloyal candid not candid quiet restless courageous timid tactful tactless mature immature sympathetic unsympathetic reliable unreliable The Minnesota form is concerned chiefly with those traits which have to do with the pupils attitude and habits of work It would seem that the teacher would find difficulty in rating each pupil even approximately in some of these respects The Chicago form is more comprehensive and asks only for the out standing traits which the pupil is likely to reveal to the discriminating teacher The categories of adjectives suggested in this form have been derived empirically by selecting the different adjectives actually used by teachers in a set of reports made at the end of the seventh week of the school year and seem to be comprehensive The space for remarks gives opportunity for further descriptive details which are frequently found necessary in describing adequately these traits The usual semester or term reports give little if any more information than the grade and number of absences for the period covered SuchEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 133 detailed reports as these if made early in the year after the teacher has had sufficient time to estimate the qualities of the pupil may be valuable in several ways The analytic attitude of the teacher required for the proper filling out of the report should give a better understanding of the pupils need and should cause the teacher to adapt his methods to secure better results for the pupil These reports assembled and filed in the office are made available for all teachers for comparison of the estimates of their pupils with those of other teachers The principal finds these reports valuable for purposes of diagnosis and as a basis for advice to pupils and parents about the school work AN HONOR CLUB Superintendent F E Lurton of East Grand Forks Minnesota writes of the organization of an Honor Club intended to give fitting recognition for special merit industry and attainment of highschool pupils in lines of effort for which no regular credits are awarded The club is organized simply after the model of Phi Beta Kappa in colleges except that the officers selected are the three students who hold the highest number of honor points The officers or any one of them may change at any time whenever other members of the club attain a higher number of points The list of articles for which points are given can be made widely variable to suit the interests and environment of the school using this system Those in East Grand Forks are classified and listed below The number of points attached to each is determined by the relative time and effort required by that particular bit of work Opinion may easily differ as to the values here assigned CLASS AEDUCATIONAL i Participating in the Massee Gold Medal Contest  5 2 Winning said

educational section of the Indiana State Council of Defense of which J J Pettijohn is secretary has instituted the Indiana High School Patriotic Service League Briefly the plans and purposes are i Direction of all war service of pupils through the officers of a high school council of defense with committees on employment and contribu tions 2 Coordination of all warservice activities in the schools so that conflicting demands on the time and energy of the children may be avoided 3 Adjustment of curricula school terms and vacations so that the maximum of industrial work may be done with a minimum of interference in the essentials of that education which safeguards the future of the nation 4 Inculcation of patriotism through constructive service and systematic study of patriotic literature It is important to make clear that the machinery of the Patriotic Service League is not an additional organization imposed from without but a device for coordinating the war service already in existence and for regulating the demands on school children It is an attempt to give direction and effectiveness to present and future school activities in war time Each high school in the state is asked to organize a highschool council of defense to cooperate with the educational sections of the county and state councils of defense in carrying out a school program for definite active and patriotic voluntary service Of each local council the motto is to be Help Our Country Now As a means of realizing at once this splendid watchword it is proposed that in every council a committee on program shall arrange for regular and special meetings for the study and discussion of lessons on constructive patriotism empha sized as unselfish action and devoted service A committee on employment shall make a survey of the schools labor supply and the communitys need in order to bring about helpful136 THE SCHOOL REVIEW cooperation This committee shall include in its membership repre sentative citizens such as the county superintendent the county agent the vocational director farmers merchants and others who may be able to make its work more effective It is essential that the chief work of determining the labor demand be done by citizens outside of the school organization A committee on finance shall investigate and propose a system of earning and saving by the students individually and by the school col lectively It shall make recommendations as to methods of raising money and expending it wisely from the standpoint of national service It shall have general oversight of whatever funds the council may create and shall provide for auditing the books of the treasurer Underlying the entire program are three very sensible principles first that so far as possible war activities of highschool students shall be voluntary selforganized and directed secondly that the schools shall be protected from illadvised schemes and that their various activi ties shall be coordinated thirdly that school officials shall have initial and final authority in any war service which proposes to utilize the time and energy of the students As pointing toward the correlation of activities the Service League endeavors to accomplish Secretary Pettijohn urges The principal of the high school as a local representative of the United States Boys Working Reserve should be the guiding authority in the work of the Employment Committee of the High School Council of Defense and be an active member of any citizens committee which undertakes to survey the demand for labor in the community in order i To direct the call for student help on farm in store or in factory 2 To decide what boys and girls may profitably undertake outside work 3 To decide when where and how long students may work during the school day 4 To provide for reports on work done to keep record of job pay and conditions of work whenever possible 5 To balance work study and recreation so that a The work may be efficient and valuable b The study will not be unnecessarily sacrificed c The recreation may be sufficient to preserve the health and efficiency of the student The school officials shall request that calls upon students shall be made through the principal and his assistants including the Committee on Employ ment of the HighSchool Council of Defense Calls coming from outside organizations directly to the students tend to lower school discipline and student morale

ENGINEERING HERBERT C SADLER DSC Professor of Marine Engineering University of Michigan The subject of the technical training of engineers is one that has been treated at some length by many writers within the last decade In the majority of cases however little or no attention has been paid to the earlier or preparatory education of those intending to follow this profession The engineering profession naturally demands a training along highly specialized lines and the consideration of this fact has to a cer tain extent overshadowed that of the purely preparatory or what may be called the general education which must form a basis for this spe cialization In the engineering departmentsand it must also be confessed in the departments of literature science and the artsof our universities the utilitarian spirit has of late assumed a somewhat prominent place and in the endeavor to devote his time solely to those subjects which he considers will be useful or moneyproducing immediately after graduation the student in all probability will omit those studies whichA SYMPOSIUM 401 are of the nature of general culture The time which the average man can spend at the university being limited to four years and in the case of most modern engineering courses four years at a considerable pres sure the demands of the purely technical studies or those bearing immediately upon the same have rendered the introduction of any culture studies an impossibility This is due to the fact that owing to the recent developments within the sphere of science there is so much more to teach in the old subjects so much that the students ought to know about the new that four years is all too short even for the tech nical work With this atmosphere pervading the educational world it is not very surprising that the student in deciding upon the selection of certain courses will ask himself Is this particular study going to be useful to me  In his somewhat immature judgment he is apt to lay greatest stress upon those subjects which he imagines may be converted most easily into cash in the immediate future losing sight of the fact that there may be other things in life besides the mere accumulation of wealth or expertness in his profession It may be pertinent at this time to consider the position of the engi neer in the economic and social world of today In the early days of the profession the only representative was the military engineer but as time went on operations other than those of a military or semi military character demanded men whose training was not necessarily along military lines Hence arose the term  civil engineer as apply ing to those nonmilitary men engaged in engineering in a general sense The advent of steam and machinery led to a new class known latterly as mechanical engineers this term being used to distinguish the men who specialized in moving machinery rather than in statical structures In these later days the name of the various classes of engineers is legion but it is necessary here to emphasize the second main division of the engineering profession as in the early days it led to the introduction of a class of men entirely different from the civil engineers Even at the present day many are apt to couple the term engineer with machinery and its accompanying adjuncts of over alls grease and grime In the early days before the development of engineering as a science the only method of obtaining knowledge of machinery was by close402 THE SCHOOL REVIEW and intimate contact with it Engineering courses at universities were unknown and those who took up this professionor more strictly speaking tradewere in the majority of cases men of somewhat limited attainments so far as general education or culture was con cerned As time went on and engineering problems began to attract the attention of scientific men the methods of the profession began to change The old rule of thumb gave place to scientific method and the demand for men with a thorough grounding in scienceor in other words educated menincreased The reason was not far to seek New problems were arising continually and these required something more than mere practical experience in their solution Twenty years ago the employer looked askance upon the graduate of a university or technical school today the majority of large concerns will employ no one unless he is a graduate A remark made recently by the manager of one of these may perhaps be of interest as showing his complete change of front he said in speaking of the work that a university should endeavor to accomplish  You give them the ground ing and theory we can give them practice So far then as the pro fession in itself is concerned there is at the present day a demand for educated men The modern engineer occupies in many respects a unique position In practically all enterprises affecting the public at large either the responsibility is thrown directly upon the engineer or at least his aid is required partially in fact he is reponsible for nearly all those opera tions which involve the outlay of large sums of money As compared with his professional brethren in law medicine or divinity he may be said to be in a position of trust to the community at large rather than to the individual He is therefore brought into contact with all sorts and conditions of society and must meet men of all professions or trades not neces sarily in a business way only but also privately or socially If statis tics could be obtained from prominent engineers of today I have no doubt it would be discovered that the impulse which gave them their early start was due as much to the help of some influential friend as to their own native ability The faculty of being able to get on with everybody to use an everyday expression means more to the engineer than many realizeA SYMPOSIUM 403 These considerations apart from proficiency in his profession which as was seen above demands an educated man tend to emphasize the fact that he should also be a cultured man that is to say a man with some interests outside his own profession or at any rate one with sufficient training in what may be called the culture studies to appreciate what is being done in professions other than his own The above discussion of the position of the engineer in the world of today although necessarily fragmentary will perhaps be of assistance in appreciating the arguments which will follow There are certain preparatory subjects which may be regarded as common to all professions but their relative importance may be greater in some than in others The study of a socalled culture subject may be useful in fulfilling two objects first for the knowledge of the sub ject per se or as an introduction or basis to others and secondly as a general training for the mind So far as the profession of engineering is concerned at least under the existing conditions the second may be said to have the greater weight although the importance of the first cannot be overlooked While not an exact science the study of engineering demands defi niteness and conciseness of thought and one of the chief difficulties that those connected with the education of engineers have to overcome is a tendency to generalization on the part of the student An analytic in preference to a philosophic mind is the type that should be cultivated In order to be successful the student should have formed the habit of coordination and exactness in his earlier years of study While it may be the opinion of many that the introduction of some elementary form of science may accomplish this result I venture to suggest that as a general rule studies of this nature will have an effect diametrically opposite and lead toward vagueness rather than con creteness What for example can be done in a subject such as physi ology when it is taught not for the science itself but under the influ ence and as a means of propagation of certain ideas of a serious but somewhat misguided body of women  The time so spent would be far more beneficial both for a general training of the mind as well as for forming a basis to further studies if devoted to the humanities404 THE SCHOOL REVIEW As a means of inculcating ideas of exactness the study of the human ities is facile princeps The niceties of translation the importance of gender number and case the proper use of the moods and tenses and the demands of the relative clause compel the mind toward a certain definiteness which is lacking in many of the subjects taught in the early stages of education The most simple translation or even the study of the grammar of these subjects demands a directness of attention and a consideration of detail which cannot be otherwise than beneficial to a student whose work in the future will lead him into subjects where generalization is impossible As a direct preparation for many studies now required in the engi neering curriculum the humanities also play an important part In the majority of engineering schools of the present day the first two years are devoted mainly to nontechnical subjects such as preliminary mathematics English and modern languages The benefit of the study of the humanities as a preparation for modern languages is too well known to need discussion at this time A word however may be said regarding the study of English Few perhaps realize the amount of writing that an engineer has to do especially if his work is of a consulting character He is required to report upon numerous schemes he is often asked to give his opinions relative to the probable success or failure of certain undertakings and in many cases his evidence in law courts is the ruling factor of the decision These together with the preparation of specifications and contracts demand a familiarity with the English language which it must be confessed is often lacking While the cultivation of an elegant and literary style is neither demanded nor desired it is however necessary that the engineer should be able to express his ideas concisely and with at least a cer tain amount of regard to the common usages of decent English It is an everyday experience that the origin of most lawsuits in engi neering especially in cases of interpretation of a specification or in patent suits may be traceable directly to some idea loosely or inade quately expressed The English speech which one of our modern writers has aptly characterized as the sea that receives tributaries from every region under heaven requires a background of training in the humanities at least for a full appreciation of sentence structure if not for the benefit derived from the study of the grammar of these subjectsA SYMPOSIUM 405 It may be pertinent here to call attention to the amount of time spent upon and the methods of teaching English grammar in most of our public schools The idiosyncrasies of the preposition and the con junction the use of the comma and semicolon and many other details throughout the whole domain of English are learned by rote and the ease with which some children can reel off pages of rules without the slightest idea of their meaning or application is at once a source of wonder and pity I venture to suggest that if half the time at present devoted to this kind of study of English were spent upon Latin the net result both from an educational and mindtraining point of view could not be otherwise than beneficial As a matter of fact most children begin the study of languages far too late in their curriculum and there is no reason why Latin and perhaps French should not be begun in the grade schools So much of the earlier part of a language must necessarily be learned by rote that it seems hard to realize why these studies have not been intro duced in preference to some of the somewhat useless and inadequate frills so often found in many of our schools Both in England and Germany Latin and French are begun at a much earlier time than heregenerally between the ages of eight and ten and what may seem peculiar no other studies are neglected to make way for these Although the above discussion may be considered as somewhat beyond the scope of the present paper yet when the previous argu ments are taken into account I trust I may be permitted this digression In connection with the study of the humanities as a preparation for an engineering education the question as to the length of time that should be devoted to these will naturally arise The work at present required of engineering students in the general fouryear course leaves practically no time fcr elective studies and even if time were available it is an open question whether this should be devoted to the further study of humanities or not especially as in any case it would not amount to a sufficient number of college hours to prove beneficial In the years immediately preceding the universitythat is to say throughout the highschool coursethe study of the classics is cer a inly most desirable At present the engineering department of this406 THE SCHOOL REVIEW university accepts only two years of Latin for entrance requirements but in all probability these conditions will be revised in the future If the languages could be begun in the grade schools then perhaps three years of classics in the high schools would prove sufficient for most cases The last year could then be devoted to those subjects such as chemistry physics and modern languageswhich would cover the other entrance requirements After all the object of a university entrance examination is simply to show that the student has a moderately welltrained mind and I venture to suggest that one who has devoted his time to the study of the humanities will be in as good a condition to absorb the university work as one who has spent his time in getting a smattering of a number of subjects some of which are practically useless It may be interesting to notice that on the average over the past three years 49 per cent of the total number of entrance languages presented by candidates for admission to our engineering department were Latin about 37 per cent German and Ii per cent French and the remainder a small fraction of Greek Spanish or no languages at all Of these it is a little difficult to say without looking up a mass of certificates how many students had more than two years of Latin but the presumption is that the majority did not have more than this amount While two years of a language such as Latin is certainly better than none at all it is doubtful if a student has any particular grasp of the subject in so short a time The difficulties attendant upon the somewhat crowded conditions of work in the regular fouryear course as well as the demand for men with a somewhat broader education have led the engineering faculty of this institution to consider the advisability of arranging a sixyear combined literary and engineering course As however the technical work has been revised and rearranged during the past yearand this in itself has entailed a considerable amount of changethe committeee in charge of the proposed course deemed it wise to see how this new scheme worked before reporting upon any further possibilities of extension In a general way it may be said that the work in the literary department will be chosen so as to  Since the reading of this paper the Engineering Department of the University of Michigan has decided to accept two three or four years of Latin Greek is also ac cepted for entranceA SYMPOSIUM 407 give the student a good general coursewith perhaps a few electives but not many It is the desire of the department to give the student a broader education especially on the culture side With this in view it is hardly necessary to point out the advisability of the study of the classics in the highschool grades Even with a six year course provided that a student had at least four years of Latin previously to his coming to the university it is doubtful if there would be any particular advantage in the continuance of this line of study in his higher education While the writer is aware that many points in connection with the subject of this paper have remained unconsidered or dwelt upon somewhat lightly it was thought best to give a general survey of the conditions at present obtaining in the engineering profession and to trust that some of the important details would come up in the dis cussion In conclusion it may be said that it should be the desire and aim of everyone connected with the education of engineers to raise the stand ard of the average or rank and file of the profession so that in the future it will not be a source of wonder and surprise when an engineer is dis covered who has interests outside his profession and who can appre ciate art and literature for themselves alone

j100358,The School Review,1075120,Books Received,i244551,BOOK REVIEWS On the whole the book is one to be highly commended A teacher with only a laboratory knowledge of this subject would not choose it and if it be an educational aim to make comparative anatomists out of our secondary school pupils it is not the book to use If however we wish to acquaint them with the members of the animal kingdom especially in their relation to men it is a valuable textbook It is perhaps a little abrupt An introductory chapter might well be inserted With a good teacher to make up the possible deficiency the book leaves little to be desired E G DEXTER THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS Handbook on Linear Persiective Shadows and Reflections By OTTO FUCHS Boston Ginn  Co I902 Pp 34I3 doublepage plates SELDOM if ever does the author of a book on drawing succeed more fully in accomplishing his purpose than has Professor Fuchs in this handbook He aimed to produce a clear and comprehensive yet concise treatise on perspective drawing for the use of students of art and architecture and he has done it It is not overloaded with intricate problems neither is it lacking in problems involving vital principles Those given are well selected for the purpose of illustrating principles and they lead directly to practical results The plates are wellmade and clear they are printed on sheets of thin paper and

Little Brown  Co Writing in a delightfully entertaining manner of a subject that has an interest for everyone Mr Sears has made us his debtors The ponderous paragraph and the too acute literary criticism are but little in evidence and the reader is carried along without much effort on his part As might perhaps be expected from his domicile Mr Sears sees but little in our country in literature except that produced in New Eng land and perhaps in the South Tennyson By Sir Alfred Lyall Size 7Y X 5 Pp 200 Price Ioo New York The Macmillan Co This is the sort of literature that ought to be included in the history of litera ture  in the high school In nothing is it too much Northern Hero Legends By Otto L Jiriczek Translated by M Ben tinck Smith Size 6 X 4 Pp 146 Price o 40 New

Colonial Children Selected and annotated by Albert Bushnell Hart with the collaboration of Blanche E Hazard Size 7Y X 5X Pp 233 Price 040 New York The Macmillan Co This is one of the most ambitious of our supplementary readers It must have been a more difficult task to adapt the literature of long ago both in form and in con tent so as to enlist the interest of children of today than to write new stories The excellence with which this has been done is a testimony to the ability of the editors The publishers have aided the work in no little measure by the attractive old time form of type and illustrations Camps and Firesides of the Revolution By A B Hart and Mabel Hill Size 7YX5  Pp 309 Price 050 New York The Macmillan Co This volume sustains the good impression made by the first and is

Educationist By John George Hodgins Size 834 X 5 4 paper Pp 23 Price 025 Toronto William Briggs Egerton Ryerson was really the founder of the educational system of the province of Ontario a system known throughout America as an example of what centralization will accomplish It is doubtless true that Dr Rverson would not have stood for all that has been done since his time but he laid the foundations broad and deep and each stone can be justified His labors would have been remembered with but a hazy indefiniteness had not his colaborer Dr Hodgins written an appreciative sketch and preserved in permanent form the records of the early legislation in Upper Can ada This pamphlet gathers in a small space the salient points of his administration of educational affairs Stories in Stone from the Roman Forum By Isabel Lovell Size 7 X 5 2 Pp 258 New York The Macmillan Co The authoress says that the how  belongs to the archaeologist but the why is for this bookwhy the Forum became

twelve volumes in which is to be treated the general history of Europe and of her colonies since the fifteenth century Each of these volumes will have for its central thought some great historical fact of special importance hence the first is called the Renaissance This will be followed by the Reformation the United States of America the French Revolution Napoleon etc and so the succession is given a unity that is not merely one of name The value of such a work to the student of history social economic political and educa tional will be very great as he sees here the opinions of specialists in the various phases of historical development placed in close relationship to one another and so he can better appreciate the full significance of the great movements Lessons on

series of which the aim is to meet the demands of teachers who find it impossible to expand the study of this subject so far into the causes of present geographical conditions as to call for scientific attainments on the part of children It is profusely illustrated but many of the illustrations are poorly executed Opening at random it is interesting to one who has just returned from riding over the boundless prairies of the Canadian Northwest with the fields of wheat and oats stretching for miles to read that these territories are most important for their furs forests and minerals A Complete Geography By R S Tarr Cornell University and Frank M McMurry Columbia University Size 6 X8  Pp478 Priceioo New York The Macmillan Co This is the complete geography in the twobook series One has some difficulty in following closely the many adaptations of this series A good feature of this geography is the arrangement by which the discussion of seasonal changes winds etc is postponed until the children have had a study of the country as a country There is a danger that in our desire to escape from the society of the oldfashioned geographers we may go too far and become so enamored of the physiographers that the harm will not be less An Elementary Commercial Geography By Cyrus C Adams Size 5  X 7  Pp 35I Price Iio New York D Appleton  Co The aim of the author is to give simply and broadly a view of the world in its relation to man as a producer and a trader The improvements in transportation the application of steam power to manifold forms of machinery and the

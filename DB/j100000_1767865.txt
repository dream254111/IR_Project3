mistral or northwest wind the scourge of the lower valley of the Rhone from Valence to Avignon He went on to de scribe the climate of the Riviera illustrating it by lantern slides from recent photographs including views of Hyeres Costabella Cannes Nice Mentone San Remo etc and he showed the three principal causes of the warm winter in this region to be 1 the southern latitude 2 the protection from cold winds by mountain ranges and 3 the equalizing and warming influence of the Med iterranean Sea which being practically tideless is always equally potent not varying with hour and season Dr Williams men tioned the weak points of the southofFrance climate with its blustering mistral its occasional cold bise its moist siroccowind but summed up the Riviera winter climate as being on the whole clear bright and dry with fog and mist practically unknown with a winter temperature of 8 to 10 higher than England has though subject to considerable nocturnal radiation with about half the number of rainy days and four to five the number of bright ones which she can boast of with cold winds and cold weather without which it would lose its healthgiving effect After the delivery of this address the meeting was adjourned in order to allow the fellows and their friends an opportunity to in spect the exhibition of instruments relating to climatology which had been arranged in the rooms of the Institution of Civil Engi neers 25 Great George Street The Meteorological Office showed a set of instruments necessary for the equipment of a climatologi cal station viz Stevenson thermometerscreen fitted with dry bulb wetbulb maximum and minimum thermometers and also a raingauge Thermometers were also shown for ascertaining the temperatures on the ground under the ground and at a dis tance as well as for recording temperature continuously Various forms of sunshine recorders were exhibited as well as a number of actinometers and solar radiation instruments for ascertaining the heating effect of the solar rays The exhibition included a large and interesting collection of hygrometers also several rain gauges and other instruments Among the curiosities is a piece of plate glass which was starred during a thunderstorm on Aug 21 1879 this was not broken but it has a number of wavy hairlike lines The exhibition contains a large number beautiful photographs of clouds lightning and snowscenes as well as of the damage done by the destructive tornado at Lawrence Mass USA NOTES AND NEWS ON April 16 at the Department of Archaeology and Palmeon tology of the University of Pennsylvania will take place the open ing of the Loan Collection of Objects used in Worship already referred to in these columns A very intense light such as is required for photographic or occasionally for medical purposes may as is well known be readily obtained by burning magnesium ribbon which has how ever the disadvantage of being somewhat expensive An excel lent substitute according to Lancet has been found by a French chemist M Villon in aluminium which is about a third of the price of magnesium and which may be utilized in the same man ner by burning it in a spirit lamp or if a flame of much more intense brilliancy is required in a coal gas or spirit flame sup plied with a jet of oxygen In these it burns without emitting fumes in which respect it is superior to magnesium The light given by aluminium has a high actinic power  nearly as high indeed as that of magnesium The most convenient way of ob taining a very intense light according to lM Villon is to use a lamp provided with a jet of oxygen at the centre of its flame into which powdered aluminium mixed with a quarter of its weight of lycopodium and a twentieth of its weight of nitrate of ammonium can be projected by means of a tube furnished with an airball This gives an exceedingly intense light without smoke A mixture of aluminium powder with chlorate of potash and sugar can be ignited giving an intense light by means of guncotton but is somewhat dangerous Probably the best plan for medical photog NCE 215 raphy or for laryngoscopic and auroscopic and other demonstra tions would be to burn a ribbon of aluminium in an ordinary spirit lamp Of course if oxygen and an oxyhydrogen or an oxyalco holic lamp were at hand a much more intense light could be ob tained The London Times of March 24 printed the following com munication from a correspondent Under the direction of the Austrian Government an interesting series of deepsea explora tions has been conducted recently in the eastern parts of the Med iterranean by a scientific party on board the i Pola At one point about 50 nautical miles southwest from Cape Matapan the Pola found a depth of 4400 metres 2406 fathoms followed within a few miles further east by a depth of 4080 metres 2236 fathoms which are the greatest deptlis recorded in the Mediter ranean They have received from the Austrian Hydrographical Board the name of Pola Deep The great depression of the Mediterranean must thus be shifted considerably east from its former central position on the maps Another deep area was ex plored between Candia and Alexandriathe depths attaining from 3310 metres 1810 fathoms some twenty miles southeast of Grandes Bay and from 2392 metres 1208 fathoms to 2120 metres 1322 fathoms within a short distance from Alexandria the maximum depth sounded being 3068 metres 1678 fathoms in 28 39 30 north latitude and 33 19 54 east longitude The highest temperature was found during the first part of the voyage at depths of 1 to 50 metres the highest being 808 Fahrenheit at 1 metre the lowest temperature 52 was observed at the issue from the Adriatic Sea at a depth of 760 metres In explorations conducted some two years ago in the Central Mediterranean it was observed that the density of the water and its saturation with salt increased with depth and the same was neticed in the west ern part of this years cruise But in the Eastern Mediterranean the density of water varies but very little in the different strata and it is higher on the whole than in the west The transparency of the water is very great in the Eastern Mediterranean Al together the Pola made no fewer than 50 deep sea soundings 27 of which touched depths of more than 1000 metres P Blakiston Son  Co Philadelphia announce that they will soon publish  Physical Education by Frederick Treves FRCP The subject of physical education as a hygienic measure has recently attracted so much attention from school boards the medical profession and sanitarians generally that it now ranks in importance with the various branches of study pursued in our public schools and colleges To the average city man or woman of sedentary occupation physical exercise is of quite as much con sequence as it is to school children and college students It is however often taken up unwisely and to the lasting harm of those who in ignorance attempt methods that are unsuited to their physical condition It has therefore been thought advisable to publish from the advance sheets of A Treatise on Hygiene this paper by one of the best known medical writers of the day that it might be within the reach of those who would not perhaps care to purchase the larger work in which it will be included Houghton Mifflin  Co announce that Mrs Olive Thorne Miller adds to her two excellent books about birds already pub lished by this firm a third to which she gives the title  Little Brothers of the Air It describes between twenty and thirty different birds and for all lovers of birds who are happily very numerous this little book has special attractions Professor Child has prepared the eighth part of his remarkable edition of English and Scottish Popular Ballads It was originally ex pected that the work would be complete with the eighth part but Professor Child has been successful in discovering a good deal of material which he had hardly anticipated finding so that at least one more part is necessary to complete the work The Satchel Guide for the Vacation Tourist in Europe  has been re vised for 1892 and as heretofore holds the first rank among Guides for those who wish to cover only a part of Europe and make a tour instead of a thorough continued study of many places

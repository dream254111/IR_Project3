j100358,The School Review,1075529,Recent Educational Bibliography IV,i244538,RECENT EDUCATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY1 IV THERE is no satisfactory bibliography of educational litera ture in English because no compiler has ever systematically and thoroughly included periodical literature or has listed separately the articles in the publications of the British and American bureaus of education and educational societies This is to be sure now being done for current literature by the annual bibliography of education printed in every April number of the Educational Review the second number of which is noted elsewhere in this article but the vast body of widely scattered miscellaneous edu tional literature which has grown up in the past thirty years is not accessible in any one record or series of records and is available only in varying degrees through the use of a number of different indexes several of them quite unsatisfactory and some of them unknown to most educational workers because made primarily by and for librarians and not teachers Beside these general indexes it is possible for the student of educational literature to stand on the shoulders of preceding workers in certain fields who have left behind them records of the references which they found useful in the study of certain subjects Formerly this reference to authorities was made very infor mally in the text or in vague and scanty footnotes Of late it is more and more common for the author of a book or mono graph to append a formal bibliography where he lists all the literature bearing on his theme which he has used or come to know It is plain that if such bibliographies could be regularly dis covered and noted they would be of much use to later students to professors and teachers in compiling syllabi and reading lists Numbers I 2 and 3 of this series are in SCHOOL REVIEW for October 1898 I899 and 1900 534RECENT EDUCATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY to libraries in directing searchers to desired information and in many other ways It is the purpose of these annual articles in each October number of the SCHOOL REVIEW to record every item of this sort under the proper subject heading and to add such critical and descriptive comment as shall seem helpful and proper There is a wide difference in the merit of these bibliogra phies thus noted A very bad reference list may accompany a very good book often indeed a hotchpotch of more or less relevant titles is tossed together without order method accuracy or comment and labeled Bibliography Many such lists might be very much improved by a little extra work intelligently done according to accepted biblio graphical criteria To the end that future lists recorded in these articles from year to year may be made of the utmost value it seems worth while to set down a few of the points which mark a good bibliography and which are too often disre garded I Annotation How slight is the value of a bare list of titles on History of Education compared with a list which tells you that this volume is an absurd compilation by a man who knows nothing about the subject that the next is a dryasdust skele ton of facts confessedly written to be crammed for teachers examinations that a third is the best book in English on the subject but comes only to the eighteenth century etc One loses patience with the man who writing as an expert with all the important literature of the subject under his eye refuses to tell about it but sets down a bare title for our use If the compiler dislikes to attempt critical evaluation even mere descriptive notes giving authors point of view his limita tions of time or style readers for whom it is most useful etc are always useful 2 Alphabetical arrangement by authors surnames Not by titles nor haphazard If the author is a society or body corporate consult a competent catalogue for form of entry If bibli ography is classified in sections alphabet separately for each section 535THE SCHOOL REVIEW 3 Bibliographical data An accurate title place or publisher and date are essential Paging price and size are helpful 4 Material included should be pertinent and references exact when special chapters paragraphs or articles are meant A recent history of education contains in the appended bibliography these titles  Encyclopedia Brittanica Educational Review Stoddard Lectures on Travel Ridpath Library of Universal History with no clue whatever as to what articles volumes or lectures are meant The items would much better be omitted entirely than given in such form Fancy the state of mind of the student who wishes to do collateral reading on education in India and finds in this same volume at the head of the chapter on that subject these definite and illuminating references Spofford Library of Historic Characters Macaulay Essays Encyclopedia Brittanica Arnold Light of Asia Marshman History of India A little more pains and conscience worked into bibliography will greatly increase its value to readers and students The following are the most notable pieces of recent bibliog raphy which seem likely tobe of use to educational workers ARITHMETIC Notes on the History of American TextBooks on Arithmetic By J M GREENWOOD and ARTEMAS MARTIN in U S Bureau of Education Report of the Commissioner 18978 Vol I 789 868 and 18989 Vol I 781837 A chronological list of all arithmetics ever published in this coun try of which copies can be found or records discovered The titlepage is given in full biographical data regarding authors full descriptions and tables of contents The first edition is described whenever possible and in most cases each volume has been examined by one of the compilers There is an author index to both parts at the end 536RECENT EDUCATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY CHILDSTUDY The Child A Study in the Evolution of Man By A F CHAM BERLAIN 498 pp O New York I900 On pages 465495 are listed in one alphabet with ample data for references 696 titles mainly periodical articles of which mention is made in the body of the book As such a mention is the only cri terion for inclusion it follows that the list is neither a complete nor exactly a selected bibliography but merely a long list of titles quoted by the author A handy scheme of reference by number and page joins text and bibliography As the author expressly stipulates that his book is an anthropo logical study of the significance of the child and childhood in human evolution the list closely reflects this phase of thought and is not along the usual psychological lines of childstudy Three fourths of the titles given are neither in Mr McDonalds nor in Mr L N Wilsons lists which are the fullest previous bibli ographies of childstudy although many of Mr Chamberlains refer erences are either too general or too restricted in matter to interest the ordinary reader Bibliography of ChildStudy for the year 1899 By L N WILSON in Pedagogical Seminary December 900o Vol VII 526 556 Four hundred and fortyone titles from the second annual supple ment to the lists begun in this journal for April I898 and continued in September I899 The list includes very much perhaps nearly everything that is important on the subject and also many titles that are revelant only by a very broad and somewhat strained conception of the term childstudy There seems to be no good reason for including Dutton Social Phases of Education Wright Outlines of Practical Sociology and other similar titles More than one third of the articles listed are in foreign languages COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY Bibliography of Columbia University in U S Bureau oy Education Circular of Education 1900 No 3 pp 194I98 An extensive list of publications and articles by and about the university from its founding to I890 It is a pity that the list should be ten years behind the date of the printing of the monograph it should have been revised and brought down to the present 537THE SCHOOL REVIEW CORNELL UNIVERSITY Bibliography of Cornell University in U S Bureau of Education Circular of Information I900 No 3 pp 421425 Seventytwo titles classified under the heads public acts and docu ments relating to the university Histories of the school Lives of the founder Publications of the university alumni and undergraduates There are many helpful notes and the list seems to have been made about i890 and imperfectly revised in I895 DOMESTIC ECONOMY Bibliography of German Books Concerning Instruction in Domestic Economy to Girls in U S Bureau of Education Report of the Commissioner 18989 Vol I 187189 Seventyseven titles treating of the place value and content of the subject in the curriculum with list of the reports of some German cooking and housekeeping schools EDUCATION The Church and Popular Education By H B ADAMS 84 pp O Baltimore 1900 Johns Hopkins University Studies XVIII 393436 Section 5 pp 474476 gives a selected list of titles with brief com ments of literature relating to the institutional church and the proper function of the church in education Outline Studies in the History of Education By A S OLIN 120 pp O Lawrence Kan 19oo This little book prints outline syllabi of fiftytwo lectures forming the course on history of education offered by the author at Kansas University Reading references covering each lecture are found in parallel columns giving accurate citation by chapter and inclusive pages A list io6 titles of works cited in the references fills pages 110120 Full title and imprint data are given but no notes Only titles of works in English are given The omission of a number of books as important and available as Mullinger Schools of Charles the Great Bowen Froebel Keatinge Comenius Great Didactic and Woodward Vittorino da Feltre will impair the worth of the book in many hands although ample mar ginal space is left for additional references 538RECENT EDUCATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY Bibliography of Education for I9oo By J I WYER and I E LORD in Educational Review April I901 Vol XXI 382 421 This is the second number of what is now an annual feature of the Educational Review The scope and distinctive features of the work are clearly stated in an introductory paragraph and were set forth in the notice of the initial number in the SCHOOL REVIEW for October 1900 The number of titles listed in 1900 481 against 6I8 in I899 indi cates a more rigid selection by the compilers whose purpose it is to include only what is distinctly worth while The typographical setting is much more pleasing than in the first number and the notes are better and more numerous The arrange ment which groups all material on each subject providing in addition a full author index should make this list useful to all readers writers and workers along educational lines FRENCH LANGUAGE Books of Reference for Students and Teachers of French By E G W BRAUNHOLTZ 80 pp 0 London 1901 A very useful little volume containing a quite surprising amount of information on topics directly pertaining and remotely related to the subject ranging from general bibliographies of French literature to books on French folklore art etc The book will be of most use in colleges and universities as few high schools would use or afford to buy such a collection More thorough data showing publisher price and date of books should have been given as well as more critical and descriptive comment The Nation for May 2 I9o0 on p 359 notes some important omis sions from the lists GEOGRAPHY The Teaching of Geography in Switzerland and North Italy By J B REYNOLDS II2 pp D London I899 A report presented

Circular of Information 1899 No 3 Lists of references are distributed through the monograph in foot notes and at the end of each article Many of the items are too vaguely and informally cited to serve as more than hints but the sum total is a very considerable bibliography KINDERGARTEN Concerning a few Books on ChildTraining By EMILIE POULSSON in her Love and Law in ChildTraining Springfield 1899 Pp 221235 Describes a dozen or two of the best books for kindergartners with especial reference to those which will be of value in interesting parents in the kindergarten A list from so authoritative

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075529,RECENT EDUCATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IV,I244538,RECENT EDUCATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY1 IV THERE IS NO SATISFACTORY BIBLIOGRAPHY OF EDUCATIONAL LITERA TURE IN ENGLISH BECAUSE NO COMPILER HAS EVER SYSTEMATICALLY AND THOROUGHLY INCLUDED PERIODICAL LITERATURE OR HAS LISTED SEPARATELY THE ARTICLES IN THE PUBLICATIONS OF THE BRITISH AND AMERICAN BUREAUS OF EDUCATION AND EDUCATIONAL SOCIETIES THIS IS TO BE SURE NOW BEING DONE FOR CURRENT LITERATURE BY THE ANNUAL BIBLIOGRAPHY OF EDUCATION PRINTED IN EVERY APRIL NUMBER OF THE EDUCATIONAL REVIEW THE SECOND NUMBER OF WHICH IS NOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ARTICLE BUT THE VAST BODY OF WIDELY SCATTERED MISCELLANEOUS EDU TIONAL LITERATURE WHICH HAS GROWN UP IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS IS NOT ACCESSIBLE IN ANY ONE RECORD OR SERIES OF RECORDS AND IS AVAILABLE ONLY IN VARYING DEGREES THROUGH THE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INDEXES SEVERAL OF THEM QUITE UNSATISFACTORY AND SOME OF THEM UNKNOWN TO MOST EDUCATIONAL WORKERS BECAUSE MADE PRIMARILY BY AND FOR LIBRARIANS AND NOT TEACHERS BESIDE THESE GENERAL INDEXES IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE STUDENT OF EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE TO STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF PRECEDING WORKERS IN CERTAIN FIELDS WHO HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEM RECORDS OF THE REFERENCES WHICH THEY FOUND USEFUL IN THE STUDY OF CERTAIN SUBJECTS FORMERLY THIS REFERENCE TO AUTHORITIES WAS MADE VERY INFOR MALLY IN THE TEXT OR IN VAGUE AND SCANTY FOOTNOTES OF LATE IT IS MORE AND MORE COMMON FOR THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK OR MONO GRAPH TO APPEND A FORMAL BIBLIOGRAPHY WHERE HE LISTS ALL THE LITERATURE BEARING ON HIS THEME WHICH HE HAS USED OR COME TO KNOW IT IS PLAIN THAT IF SUCH BIBLIOGRAPHIES COULD BE REGULARLY DIS COVERED AND NOTED THEY WOULD BE OF MUCH USE TO LATER STUDENTS TO PROFESSORS AND TEACHERS IN COMPILING SYLLABI AND READING LISTS NUMBERS I 2 AND 3 OF THIS SERIES ARE IN SCHOOL REVIEW FOR OCTOBER 1898 I899 AND 1900 534RECENT EDUCATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY TO LIBRARIES IN DIRECTING SEARCHERS TO DESIRED INFORMATION AND IN MANY OTHER WAYS IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THESE ANNUAL ARTICLES IN EACH OCTOBER NUMBER OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW TO RECORD EVERY ITEM OF THIS SORT UNDER THE PROPER SUBJECT HEADING AND TO ADD SUCH CRITICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE COMMENT AS SHALL SEEM HELPFUL AND PROPER THERE IS A WIDE DIFFERENCE IN THE MERIT OF THESE BIBLIOGRA PHIES THUS NOTED A VERY BAD REFERENCE LIST MAY ACCOMPANY A VERY GOOD BOOK OFTEN INDEED A HOTCHPOTCH OF MORE OR LESS RELEVANT TITLES IS TOSSED TOGETHER WITHOUT ORDER METHOD ACCURACY OR COMMENT AND LABELED BIBLIOGRAPHY MANY SUCH LISTS MIGHT BE VERY MUCH IMPROVED BY A LITTLE EXTRA WORK INTELLIGENTLY DONE ACCORDING TO ACCEPTED BIBLIO GRAPHICAL CRITERIA TO THE END THAT FUTURE LISTS RECORDED IN THESE ARTICLES FROM YEAR TO YEAR MAY BE MADE OF THE UTMOST VALUE IT SEEMS WORTH WHILE TO SET DOWN A FEW OF THE POINTS WHICH MARK A GOOD BIBLIOGRAPHY AND WHICH ARE TOO OFTEN DISRE GARDED I ANNOTATION HOW SLIGHT IS THE VALUE OF A BARE LIST OF TITLES ON HISTORY OF EDUCATION COMPARED WITH A LIST WHICH TELLS YOU THAT THIS VOLUME IS AN ABSURD COMPILATION BY A MAN WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE SUBJECT THAT THE NEXT IS A DRYASDUST SKELE TON OF FACTS CONFESSEDLY WRITTEN TO BE CRAMMED FOR TEACHERS EXAMINATIONS THAT A THIRD IS THE BEST BOOK IN ENGLISH ON THE SUBJECT BUT COMES ONLY TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ETC ONE LOSES PATIENCE WITH THE MAN WHO WRITING AS AN EXPERT WITH ALL THE IMPORTANT LITERATURE OF THE SUBJECT UNDER HIS EYE REFUSES TO TELL ABOUT IT BUT SETS DOWN A BARE TITLE FOR OUR USE IF THE COMPILER DISLIKES TO ATTEMPT CRITICAL EVALUATION EVEN MERE DESCRIPTIVE NOTES GIVING AUTHORS POINT OF VIEW HIS LIMITA TIONS OF TIME OR STYLE READERS FOR WHOM IT IS MOST USEFUL ETC ARE ALWAYS USEFUL 2 ALPHABETICAL ARRANGEMENT BY AUTHORS SURNAMES NOT BY TITLES NOR HAPHAZARD IF

ARTICLES OF WHICH MENTION IS MADE IN THE BODY OF THE BOOK AS SUCH A MENTION IS THE ONLY CRI TERION FOR INCLUSION IT FOLLOWS THAT THE LIST IS NEITHER A COMPLETE NOR EXACTLY A SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY BUT MERELY A LONG LIST OF TITLES QUOTED BY THE AUTHOR A HANDY SCHEME OF REFERENCE BY NUMBER AND PAGE JOINS TEXT AND BIBLIOGRAPHY AS THE AUTHOR EXPRESSLY STIPULATES THAT HIS BOOK IS AN ANTHROPO LOGICAL STUDY OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHILD AND CHILDHOOD IN HUMAN EVOLUTION THE LIST CLOSELY REFLECTS THIS PHASE OF THOUGHT AND IS NOT ALONG THE USUAL PSYCHOLOGICAL LINES OF CHILDSTUDY THREE FOURTHS OF THE TITLES GIVEN ARE NEITHER IN MR MCDONALDS NOR IN MR L N WILSONS LISTS WHICH ARE THE FULLEST PREVIOUS BIBLI OGRAPHIES OF CHILDSTUDY ALTHOUGH MANY OF MR CHAMBERLAINS REFER ERENCES ARE EITHER TOO

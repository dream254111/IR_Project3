1900 when the beautiful Whitin Observatory equipped with twelveinch telescope threeinch transit all necessary apparatus and an adequate li brary in astronomy was opened through the generosity of Mrs John C Whitin a trustee of the college In 1906 the observatory was doubled to make room for the teaching of astronomy as other sciences are taught by the laboratory method and a residence for the astronomers was added Professor Hayes head of the department of applied mathe matics a pupil of Ormund Stone meantime conducted work in mathematical astronomy In 1901 the department of astronomy was created including both the astrophysical and the mathematical sides of the subject Dr Duncan has worked at Lick Lowell and Yerkes observatories and has taught at Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges FRANK H

School of Trop ical Medicine in succession to the late Sir Francis Lovell DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE A NEW FORM OF PLANT DRIER A NUMBER of notices have been published regarding the use of single or doublefaced corrugated straw board as a means of rapid drying of plants for herbaria Some have omitted the use of the customary driers with the corrugated boards a procedure which has a tendency to cause the plants to be somewhat wrinkled It has also been recommended that the boards be cut so that the corrugations run crosswise of the board The pressure of the straps around the press however has a greater tendency to close up the ends of the corrugations when they run crosswise than when they run lengthwise To avoid handling two driers and a corrugated board for every plant placed in press the writer adopted the plan several years ago of fastening at the corners with a wire stapling machine two driers with a corrugated board between This procedure saves two thirds of ones time in handling the corrugated boards and two driers in the old way While this form of drier worked very satisfactorily when hot sunshine or artificial heat was available for drying it made the drying material much thicker than necessary An order was consequently given to a local firm for a special drier consisting of two pieces of ordinary felt drying paper with a corrugated filler such as is used in the single and doublefaced corrugated straw board This material has given entire satisfaction and can be obtained in large quantities at a cost of about 1656 per 1000 as compared with 1 Kellerman W

quoted by one firm for medium weight and 14 per 1000 for heavy weight driers When it is considered that a large part of the material pressed under the old system using blotters alone required the use of two blotters between each specimen it will be seen that a considerable saving is effected in the cost of the drying material as well as in the time required to handle and completely dry the material P L RICKER BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY A NEW COLOR VARIETY OF THE NORWAY RAT NORWAY rats with dilute coat color have re cently been taken in the vicinity of the Uni versity of Pennsylvania If we may judge from the fact that the nine individuals thus far found are all approximately alike and are distinctly different from the normal type they probably represent a new Mendelian variety The coat is intermediate in color between that of the ordinary dark form and the albino and resembles that of the redeyed guinea pig In the guinea pig this color has been shown by Wright to be allelomorphic with albinism and with dilute As in the guinea pig the hair of the new rat seems to be without yellow pig ment and is dilute black or brown ticked with white The eyes look black unless the light is very bright When the light shines directly into them they appear pink They are distinctly lighter than the eyes of Castles redeyed yellow rats but darker than those of his pinkeyed yellows The new rats are now in the care of the Wistar Institute where the endeavor is being made to increase the stock and to cross with the color varieties already known Data in regard to the distribution of the new form is being collected and will later be pub lished The previously known Mendelian varieties in the rat are five black hooded albino and Castles two yellow varieties redeye and pink eye This new variety is a nonyellow dilute and may be called rubyeye PHINEAS W WHITING UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SYLVESTER AND CAYLEY UNDER the portrait with which the editor has adorned my article  Sylvester at Hop kins in The Johns Hopkins Alumni Maga zine of March 1916 the designation is simply James Sylvester This omits his real name his family name the name to which he was born for his father was Mr Abraham Joseph his two sisters were the Misses Joseph The name by which we know him he chose for himself following the example of his eldest brother who early in life established himself in America and assumed the name of Sylvester My laborious and critical friend Professor G A Miller of the University of Illinois in his recent book An Introduction to Mathe matical Literature commits the colossal error of representing Sylvester and Cayley as friends together at college Cambridge chums whereas Sylvester entered Cambridge in 1831 and Cayley was senior wrangler at Cambridge in 1842 more than a decade later Sylvester had already in the session 183738 been ap pointed professor in London University Col lege and it was in London but only after the lapse of nearly another decade in fact in 1846 that Cayley met Sylvester GEORGE BRUCE EIALSTED GREELEY COLO SCIENTIFIC BOOKS Indian Mathematics By G R KAYE Cal cutta  Simla Thacker Spink  Co 1915 Pp 73 Of all the British writers on the

at its last commencement conferred the degree of Doctor of Philosophy on Prof JonN B CLARK of Smith College The degree was conferred in recogni tion of his services to science in the work The

Eugene Schuyler Agent and ConsulGeneral of the United States at Cairo the cause of political science and international law suffers a severe loss He has been aptly described as our one trained diplomatist A nearly uninterrupted service of a quarter of a century divided among half the countries of Europe gave him an almost unique experience which joined to great natural endowments and a manysided cul ture placed him easily on a level with the best diplomatists of other States But Mr Schuyler was more than a mere professional envoy with no concern beyond the literal dis charge of his duties His intellectual activity was intense and in every country where he was stationed he tried to master the language the political institutions the usages and customs the industries the national life in all its phases or manifestations Hence his official reports to the gov ernment are many of them of rare and permanent value Such are the careful and minute account of the legal status of the Jews in Russia prepared in I872 and the reports on the productive industries of Greece Roumania and Servia to all of which countries he was accredited at the same time He is best known however by his adven turous semiofficial journey to Turkestan in 1873 at the time of Kaufmanns campaign against Khiva His most popular book Turkestan was the fruit of this journey It was characteristic of the fearless traveler that in order to show the folly of the Russian assurances that the slave trade was extinct in Central Asia he himself publicly bought a Russian slave in the marketplace of Bokhara and brought him to St Petersburg where the writer saw him in 1874 a bright pretty lad playing about the Legation Mr Schuyler also prepared a long officialreport on Central Asian affairs which is published in the Diplomatic Corre spondence for 1874 It contains some severe strictures on Russian officials and was not fitted to make the authorsPERSONAL NOTES 293 position at St Petersburg more agreeable but what other government was served so well  In Mr Schuylers reports the student of institutions will thus find a great variety and abundance of material collected on the spot But he was himself also an author of wide reputation Besides the Turkestan he wrote a life of  Peter the Great which embodied the very latest results of Russian research a volume of lectures on American Diplomacy and the Furtherance of Commerce many critical and historical contributions to the periodical press and at the time of his death was collecting materials for pursuing his Russian studies with a biography of Cath erine the Great If nature had not blessed him with the highest form of literary gift everything he wrote was marked by diligence sobriety and conscientiousness Mr Schuyler was a member of many learned societies at home and abroad and was one of the founders of the American Economic Association The American Academy of Political and Social Science received a letter from Mr Schuyler shortly before his death in which he expressed the greatest interest in the Academy and its work prom ising to contribute to its publications as he might be able HT Degrees of Doctor of

ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY for more than half a century the world loses one who may be called the father of modern sanitary science Of a family noted for longevity Sir Edwin inherited a fine physique and was a man of commanding presence Although he had more than completed his 90th year he yet retained his intellectual force and something of bodily vigor He was a man of decided opinions of exceptional knowledge and was always ready for work Born in I800 as he grew to manhood he prepared for the Bar His first publication was an Essay on Life Assurances which brought him to the notice of Grote and the two Mills It was followed when he was but 29 years old by one on Pre ventive Police This was of such marked ability that it attracted the attention of Bentham who asked Chad wick to assist him in the preparation of his Adminis trative Code They became close friends and Chadwick lived with Bentham until the death of the latter In 1832 Chadwick was offered the place of Assistant Commission er on the first Poor Law Commission nominated by Lord Grays Government His work in this position resulted in his being made Commissioner in 1833 In the same year he was appointed on the Royal Commission to investigate the condition of factory children He had a large hand in the exhaustive report which resulted in the Ten Hours Act In 1834 he became paid Secretary to the Poor Law Board a subordinate position but one giving him greater executive power which he exerted to the utmost He was opposed to outdoor relief to the ablebodied on any terms Among his official colleagues were Sir George Cornwall Lewis and Sir Francis Head To Chadwick we are indebted for the appointment of the First Sanitary Commission in 1838 which inaugurated the era of reforms The immediate call for it was an epi demical outbreak in Whitechapel parish The report of this Commission awakened scientific and intelligent inter est in the practicable measures for prevention and curePERSONAL NOTES 299

was dissolved he withdrew from pub lic life This however did not end his services in behalf of the public It was he who persuaded Lord Palmerston to send a Commission to investigate the condition of the soldiers during the Crimean campaign The success of the Commis sion led to a similar investigation with regard to the In dian forces Since 1867 he has filled the position of Presi dent at Sanitary Congresses of President of the Society of Sanitary Inspectors and President of the Economic Sec tions at meetings of the British Association Chadwick directed his attention to mental as well as bodily maladies to the slow tortures of the inmates of the debtors prison to the mortality among harassed suitors in Chancery In an exchange of letters with Pro fessor Owen he examined the psychological limits of men tal labor especially in case of the young He gave great consideration to physical training to sound rules of sani tary architecture to the treatment of the sick and insane and to the

official statistics and giving them in theirfield a universally acknowledged authority must be accorded almost without reservation to the present DirectorGen eral of the statistics of the kingdom Prof Luigi Bodio His career is a striking example of the untiring energy and quicksighted manysided intelligence of Italian scholars which is gaining for their country an honorable place in all departments of science Luigi Bodio was born October I2th 1840 at Milan where he received his early education From 185861 he306 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY studied jurisprudence at the Universities of Pavia and Pisa securing at the latter his doctorate After brief occu pation as private secretary to his friend the Minister Mat teucci he obtained one of the ten prize scholarships con ferred annually by the Italian Government upon the best stu dents of the year to enable them to study abroad Bodio chose Paris as his place of study and in intercourse with Wolowski Baudrillart Levasseur and others laid the foun dation of his absorbing interest in the problems of eco nomics and statistics In I864 he returned to Italy to occupy the position of teacher of commercial law and political economy at the scientific school at Leghorn After a brief stay at a similar school at Milan he became Professor of Commercial Geog raphy and Statistics at the Superior Commercial School at Venice In all these places Professor Bodio developed an extraordinary activity and beyond his professional work was in great demand as a member of municipal commis sions which required a good practical grasp of the ques tions to be considered and a strong organizing talent His career as a practical statistician begins with the year 1872 when he went to Rome as Secretary of the Statisti cal Central Committee in the Ministry of Agriculture Commerce and Industry At the time the position of directorgeneral of statistics was vacant the previous incumbent Dr Pietro Maestri who had filled the office since 1862 having died in 1871 Bodio was appointed to the office which he has since filled with great distinction in 1872 To him is largely due the organization of the statistics of Italy A strenuous advocate of centralization he has succeeded in uniting in his bureau all the statistics of the kingdom Not a volume issues from the press which has not had the benefit of his supervision The work is vast Besides the clerical staff the bureau com prises three physicians several lawyers and engineers for the supervision of special features of the work The difficulties have been very great It was a work of timePERSONAL NOTES 307 to accustom the population to the needs of the work to secure correct results but by dint of untiring energy by watching scrupulously every detail by perfecting at every point the methods and organization of the work the bureau and its publications are today unrivalled This has been accomplished in the face of financial difficulties and with very restricted means The activity of the Bureau is not exhausted by the publication of its great folios of tables but has another side It is the constant adviser of the ministry and legis lative commissions Questions are propounded requiring the use of unpublished materials or laborious calculations and combinations which do not exist in the published works In this silent work is forcibly illustrated the good which may be derived from a permanent statistical organization Of such weight and influence has the statistical office grown that in 1883 its rank was increased being made a diviz ione generale of the ministry In addition to his work as a statistician Bodio has been very successful as a teacher in the Engineering School at Rome His widereaching knowledge and perfect familiarity with the economic problems of the day recently received an honorable recognition in his appointment by the Italian Government as one of the three delegates repre senting Italy in the international conference for the protec tion of labor called together by the German Emperor at Berlin Prof Bodio was an active member of the International Statistical Congress and took part in the meetings at Florence 1867 Hague I869 St Petersburg 1872 and BudaPesth I876 He was a member of the permanent commission of the Congress and a vicepresident of the International Commission for the Statistics of Railways Despite the failure of the old International Statistical Con gress he has never doubted the good which might flow from the intimate connection of the statisticians of all countries He entered with enthusiasm into the plan of308 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the Institut Internationale de Statistique which was founded at London in I885 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Statistical Society He was unani mously elected secretary of the Institut and his admirable administration of its affairs and his conduct of its  Bulle tin are not least among his claims to the recognition of scholars In fact the high esteem in which his scholarship and experience is everywhere held is seen in the large number of learned bodies with which he is connected The list of these organizations bears eloquent testimony Prof Bodio is an honorary member of the Statistical Society of London the Manchester Geographical Society la Societe Suisse de Statistique Verein fiir Geographie und Statistik zu Frankfurt am Main

lInstitut de France He is an active worker in the Italian Geographical Society a member of the Reale Aca demia dei Lincei the Institut Internationale de statistique the Italian Society for Hygiene the International Criminal Law Association and others If the list is long and tedi ous it nevertheless speaks forcibly of the varied interests and the wide field of scientific research in which he is held in high esteem To name the literary productions of Prof Bodio would be a difficult task The more important publications of the Italian statistics show his work It is work of super vision and direction No better specimen of it can be seen than the Annuario Statistico Italiano which is more volPERSONAL NOTES 309 uminous more detailed and richer in explanatory matter than the year book of any other government Any attempt at an exhaustive treatment of the work of the bureau and especially of Prof Bodio must needs be a failure In addi tion to the strictly official documents Bodio has written a number of special studies too numerous for separate men tion to the journals of which he has been the editor as Archivio di Statistica 187678 and the Annali di Statistica Among his earlier works prior to his connec tion with the official statistics the most important are Sul commerczo esterno terrestre e marittimo det Regno d Italia I866 Documenti statistid del Regno dZtalia 1867 And further Della

ATMOSPHERICAL ELECTRICITY IN REGARD OF FOGS MISTS C WITH SOME REMARKS COMMUNICATED BY MR WILLIAM HENLEY S I R I N CONFORMITY TO THE DESIRE OF SOME FRIENDS I HAVE DRAWN UP THE FOLLOW ING OBSERVATIONS ON ATMOSPHERICAL ELECTRICITY WHICH I BEG LEAVE TO LAY BEFORE YOU AND SHALL THINK THE TROUBLE I HAVE HAD IN PROSECUTING THE NECESSARY EX PERIMENTS SUFFICIENTLY COMPENSATED IF IT SHALL APPEAR TO YOU THAT THEY CONTAIN ANY THING NEW OR CURIOUS IN WHICH CASE YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO DISPOSE OF THEM IN WHATEVER MANNER YOU SHALL THINK PROPER READ APRIL 30 1772 I AM S I R WITH VERY RESPECTFUL CONSIDERATION YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT THOS RONAYNE CECILSTREET FEB 15 1772 VOL LXII T SOME138  S O M E YEARS AGO I DISCOVERED BY MR CANTONS ELECTROMETER DESCRIBED IN THE PHILOS TRANSACTIONS VOL XLVIII P 783 THAT THE AIR OF IRELAND IS DURING THE WINTER SEASON IN ALMOST A CONSTANT STATE OF POSITIVE ELECTRICITY WHICH HOWEVER IS SO WEAK THAT IN ORDER TO OBSERVE IT SATISFACTORILY I HAVE AL WAYS FOUND IT NECESSARY TO HAVE THE CORKBALLS SUS PENDED FROM THREADS OF A MIDDLING FINENESS SIX OR SEVEN INCHES IN LENGTH QUITE STREIGHT AND TO AVOID AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ANY INTERRUPTION FROM THE WIND I HAVE LIKEWISE HAD FREQUENT RECOURSE TO THE FOL LOWING CONTRIVANCE BY WHICH I WAS ENABLED WITHIN DOORS TO PURSUE MY INQUIRIES WITH GREATER ACCURACY AND ADVANTAGE HAVING PROCURED A SLENDER TAPERING PIECE OF WOOD ABOUT FIVE FEET LONG TO THE SMALLER END OF WHICH AN ELECTROMETER WAS AFFIXED BY MEANS OF A SMALL HOOK I PLACED IT OUT FROM AN OPEN GARRET WINDOW AND FASTENED THE OTHER END WITH A SMALL HASP TO ONE OF THE JAMBS I HAD ALSO AT HAND ANOTHER PIECE OF WOOD IN THE ENDS OF WHICH A SMALL GLASS TUBE AND A STICK OF SEALINGWAX HAD BEEN INSERTED EITHER OF THESE WAS OCCASIONALLY EXCITED AND APPLIED NEAR THE CORKBALLS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE MORE PRE CISELY THE KIND OF ELECTRICITY WITH WHICH THEY MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE AFFECTED AND I WAS ALWAYS CAREFUL IN  I COMMENCED MY EXPERIMENTS ON THE AIR IN THE YEAR 1761 AND THOSE ON THE CLOUDS IN THE YEAR 1762 I CONTINUED THEM UN REMITTINGLY AS OPPORTUNITY OFFERED TILL THE YEAR 1770 WHEN MY OCCASIONS BROUGHT ME TO ENGLAND I HAVE REPEATED MY EX PERIMENTS WITH REGARD TO THE COMMON AIR IN DIFFERENT PLACES HERE AND FIND IT THE SAME AS THAT IN IRELAND MAKING 4139 MAKING MY EXPERIMENTS ON THAT SIDE OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE WIND HAD LEAST POWER I HAVE FOUND THE AIR IN WINTER AT A PROPER DISTANCE FROM BUILDINGS TREES MASTS OF SHIPS C VERY SEN SIBLY ELECTRIFIED DURING A FROSTY OR FOGGY STATE OF THE WEATHER AND IN MISTS TOO BUT IN A LESS DEGREE I HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED SMALL SIGNS OF IT IN CALM AND CLOUDY WEATHER THE AIR IN SUMMER NEVER SHEWED ANY SIGN OF ELECTRICITY EXCEPT WHEN A FOG HAPPENED IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING OR AT NIGHT IN WHICH CASE I ALWAYS DISCOVERED MANIFEST MARKS OF ELECTRICITY SENSIBLY WEAKER THAN THOSE OBSERVED IN WINTER FOGS BUT PRE CISELY OF THE SAME KIND THAT IS POSITIVE I HAVE OFTEN EXAMINED THE STATE OF THE AIR AT THE TIME OF AN AURORA BOREALLS AND COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY INDICATION OF ELECTRICITY EXCEPT WHEN A FOG HAD APPEARED AT THE SAME TIME IN WHICH CASE THE ELEC TRICITY HAS BEEN IN EVERY RESPECT THE SAME AS THAT OF A FOG AT ANY OTHER TIME ONCE INDEED DURING AN AURORA BOREALIS ON A REMARKABLE SERENE NIGHT I DIS COVERED SOME SIGNS OF A VERY WEAK POSITIVE ELECTRI CITY AS THE ELECTRICITY OF THE AIR IS GENERALLY POSITIVE I NEVER KNEW AN EXCEPTION BUT ONE WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF DURING A FOG ON A WINTER DAY THAT PROVED UN COMMONLY WARM IS IT NOT REASONABLE TO BELIEVE THAT COLD ELECTRIFIES THE ATMOSPHERE POSITIVELY AND IF SO MAY NOT ONE BE LED TO IMAGINE THAT HEAT ELECTRIFIES IT NEGATIVELY BUT THIS I ONLY OFFER AS A CONJECTURE NOT BEING ABLE TO ADVANCE ANY THING DECISIVE ON THE SUBJECT AND KNOWING THAT ONE SORT OF ELECTRICITY MAY T 2 OFTEN140 OFTEN BE PRODUCTIVE OF THE OTHER AS IS PLAIN FROM DR FRANKLINS EXPERIMENTS IF COLD ELECTRIFIES THE AIR POSITIVELY IN THIS CLIMATE WHICH SEEMS EXTREMELY PROBABLE MAY IT NOT ELEC TRIFY IT NEGATIVELY AT AND ABOUT THE PLACE OF OUR ANTI PODES DOES NOT A CONSIDERATION OF THE EFFECTS DIS COVERED IN THE TOURMALIN FAVOUR THIS SURMISE THE ELECTRICITY OF THE AIR IN FROSTY FOGGY OR MISTY WEATHER IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO YIELD ANY SPARK EVEN BY INSULATING A SHARP POINTED WIRE IN IT WHICH HOWEVER ATTRACTS VERY LIGHT BODIES AT A SMALL DISTANCE WHILST ON THE CONTRARY THAT OF THE CLOUDS GENERALLY AFFORDS CONSIDERABLY STRONG SPARKS WHEN A FOG BECOMES VERY THICK THE CORKBALLS APPROACH BUT WHEN IT RETURNS TO ITS FORMER STATE THEY OPEN AGAIN AT THEIR FIRST DISTANCE AND I HAVE OBSERVED THAT WHEN IT RAINED IN FOGGY WEATHER THE BALLS CLOSED AND OPENED AGAIN ON THE FOGS APPEAR ANCE ANEW AFTER THE RAIN HAD CEASED THERE IS HOW EVER A CERTAIN DEGREE OF DENSITY NECESSARY IN A FOG IN ORDER THAT THE BALLS MIGHT EXERT THEIR GREATEST DI VERGENCY MOST IF NOT ALL FOGS PARTAKE OF A SMELL MUCH LIKE THAT OF AN EXCITED GLASS TUBE AND INDEED SO DOES THE COMMON AIR VERY FREQUENTLY AS FOGS SOMETIMES APPEAR IN A VERY MOIST STATE OF THE AIR I WAS FOR SOME TIME AT A LOSS TO ACCOUNT ON WHAT PRINCIPLE THEY COULD RETAIN THEIR ELECTRICITY BUT HAVING AT LENGTH REMARKED THAT ELECTRIFIED BODIES INSULATED WITH SEALINGWAX PRESERVED THEIR ELECTRICITY FOR A TIME IN VERY DAMP AIR I CONCLUDED THAT MOIS TURE IS BUT A VERY SLOW CONDUCTOR HAVING141 HAVING ON THE CONTRARY OBSERVED THAT BODIES INSULATED WITH DRIED SILK HAD LOST THEIR ELECTRICITY IN A VERY SHORT TIME I ATTEMPTED TO RENDER IT A NON CONDUCTOR BY HAVING VARNISHED IT OVER WITH OIL OF TURPENTINE BALSAM OF SULPHUR AND SUCH LIKE BUT DID NOT SUCCEED FOR SILKS SO TREATED SOON BECAME A CONDUCTOR AND INCREASED CONSIDERABLY IN WEIGHT IF THE AIR HAPPENED NOT TO BE VERY  DRY SO MUCH INDEED THAT I THINK ORDINARY SILK FROM ITS POWER OF ABSORBING MOISTURE FROM THE AIR MAY WELL SERVE AS AN OCCASIONAL HYGROMETER EITHER BY BEING PUT INTO A BALANCE OR BY HAVING AN ELECTRIFIED BODY INSULATED WITH IT WHEN THE DENSITY OF FOGS FLOATING NEAR THE EARTH INCREASES CONSIDERABLY THE BALLS ALWAYS APPROACH BUT WHEN THEY ARE SITUATED HIGH IN AIR THE REVERSE GENERALLY HAPPENS I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF REMARK ING A STRUGGLE BETWEEN BREEZES FROM THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST AT THE SAME TIME IN WHICH THE ONE SEEMED SOMETIMES TO PREVAIL AND AFTERWARDS THE OTHER THIS CONTENTION WAS SUCEEDED BY A SMOAKY HAZINESS WHICH LIKE A FOG OCCASIONED THE BALLS TO OPEN AS THE HAZINESS  THICKENED THEY OPENED  EVEN GLASS ATTRACTS MOISTURE TO ITS SURFACE WHICH MAKES IT A CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT SO CONVENIENT AS SEALINGWAX  AN ELECTRICAL BODY WHEN CONTRACTED IN ITS DIMENSION WILL HAVE ITS ELECTRICITY INCREASED AS APPEARS BY DR FRANKLINS CU RIOUS EXPERIMENT WITH THE CHAIN AND SILVER CAN I ALSO HAVE DIS COVERED FROM REPEATED TRIALS THAT A PIECE OF FLANNEL SILK C EXCITED AND SUDDENLY TWISTED NOT ONLY STRUCK AT A GREATER DI STANCE THAN BEFORE BUT SOMETIMES EMITTED PENCILS OF FIRE INTO THE AIR MAY WE NOT HENCE INFER WHY THE ELECTRICITY OF VAPOUR C WHEN NOT IN CONTACT WITH THE EARTH INCREASES BY CONDENSA TION WIDER142 WIDER AND STILL WIDER WHEN IT DISSOLVED INTO RAIN BUT THEIR REPELLING POWER BECAME GREATEST IN PROPORTION AS THE DROPS INCREASED THE ELECTROMETER PLACED OUT FROM A GARRET WINDOW P 138 HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY USEFUL TO ME IN DE TERMINING THE NATURE OF AN APPROACHING CLOUD WHOSE ELECTRICITY ALTHOUGH GENERALLY STRONG WAS FOR THE MOST PART UNCERTAIN HAVING BEEN SOMETIMES POSITIVE AND AT OTHER TIMES NEGATIVE BUT AS THE WIND OR RAIN WERE FREQUENT IMPEDIMENTS TO THE ACCURACY OF MY EXPERIMENTS THE FOLLOWING METHODS OF MAKING OBSER VATIONS WITH SUCCESS UNDER SHELTER OCCURRED TO ME I HAVE SOMETIMES STOOD IN AN UPPER ROOM ON A CAKE OF WAX HOLDING IN MY RIGHT HAND OUT AT THE WINDOW A LONG SLENDER PIECE OF WOOD ROUND WHICH A WIRE PROJECTING A FEW INCHES HAD BEEN TWISTED AND IN MY LEFT HAND AN ELECTROMETER AN ASSISTANT HAD EX CITED GLASS OR WAX IN READINESS AT OTHER TIMES I HAVE MADE USE OF A TAPERING TUBE OF TIN TWENTY FEET LONG ENDING IN A POINT THE GREATEST PART OF IT STOOD OUT HIGH IN THE AIR AND THE THICK END FROM WHICH AN ELECTROMETER HUNG WAS SUPPORTED INSIDE THE WINDOW SOMETIMES WITH SILK CORDS AND AT OTHER TIMES WITH STRONG STICKS OF SEALING WAX SUSTAINED AT EITHER END BY HOOKS OF IRONWIRE BY EITHER OF THESE MEANS I HAVE OFTEN DISCOVERED THAT WHAT SEEMED TO ME A SINGLE CLOUD PRODUCED IN ITS PASSING OVER SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE CHANGES FROM PO SITIVE TO NEGATIVE AND FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE ELEC TRICITY THE BALLS COMING TOGETHER EACH TIME AND RE MAINING IN CONTACT A FEW SECONDS BEFORE THEY RE PELLED EACH OTHER AGAIN THE143 THE PERMANENCE OF EITHER KIND OF ELECTRICITY IN THE CLOUDS OR THE LENGTH OF TIME IN WHICH NEITHER CAN BE DISCOVERED IS UNCERTAIN SOMETIMES THE SAME ELECTRICITY HAS RETURNED AND AT OTHER TIMES HAS BEEN SUCCEEDED BY THE CONTRARY WHILST EITHER GENERALLY CAME ON AND WENT OFF GRADUALLY BUT CHANGES WERE OFTEN MADE VERY SUDDENLY BY A FLASH OF LIGHTNING ESPECIALLY IF THE THUNDERSTORM HAPPENED TO BE IN THE ZENITH A BRANCH OF IT OVERHEAD HAS FRE QUENTLY OCCASIONED STRONGER ELECTRICITY THAN I COULD DISCOVER WHEN THE GREATEST PART OF THE SKY HAD BEEN OVERCAST WHICH PERHAPS MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED FOR FROM THIS CONSIDERATION THAT ONE KIND OF ELECTRICITY ACTING ALONE MUST EXERT MORE POWERFUL EFFECTS THAN WHEN COUNTERACTED BY THE OTHER I ONCE OBSERVED IN A THUNDERSTORM DURING WHICH I SAW NO LIGHTNING THAT THE BALLS WHICH HUNG FROM THE TIN TUBE REPELLED AND ATTRACTED EACH OTHER VERY RAPIDLY FOR THE SPACE OF TEN OR TWELVE SECONDS AT THE SAME TIME MR CANTONS ELECTROMETER WHICH I HELD AT SUCH A DISTANCE FROM THE TUBE AS TO HAVE ITS BALLS OPENED TO THE DISTANCE OF AN INCH CONTINUED QUIET IN THAT STATE AND WERE NOT AFFECTED CONVULSIVELY LIKE THE OTHERS HENCE I IMAGINED THAT THE SAME KIND OF ELECTRICITY WENT OFF AND CAME ON WITHOUT BEING CHANGED IN CONTRARIUM FOR WHEN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HAPPENED THEY WERE VERY EVIDENTLY AFFECTED IN THE SAME MANNER AND HERE I MUST OBSERVE THAT I HAVE FOUND IT MORE EASY TO DISCOVER THE KIND OF ELECTRICITY PRESENT IN THE TUBE BY APPROACHING EX CITED WAX TO THE BALLS OF AN ELECTROMETER WHICH I HELD AT A PROPER DISTANCE FROM THE TUBE THAN BY AP PLYING IT NEAR THE BALLS WHICH HUNG FROM THE TUBE FOR144 FOR THEY IN THE GENERAL DIVERGED SO MUCH THAT I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE IN READINESS A SMALL TUBE OF GLASS OR WAX SUFFICIENTLY EXCITED TO AFFECT THEM IT HAS SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT THE BALLS OF THE TIN TUBE C PERFECTLY AT REST HAVE IN CONSEQUENCE OF A FLASH OF LIGHTNING SUDDENLY REPELLED EACH OTHER AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER CLOSED AS THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAS FREQUENTLY HAPPENED WHEN THE AIR WAS IN A DAMP STATE I HAVE SOMETIMES IMAGINED THAT THE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE EARTH AND LOWER CLOUDS HAD BEEN QUICKLY RESTORED ON RECEIVING THE ELECTRICITY OF THE HIGHER ONES AND AT OTHER TIMES HAVE SUPPOSED THAT IT MIGHT BE OWING TO THE LATERAL EFFECT OF THE EXPLOSION IF TWO OR MORE PERSONS AT A SUFFICIENT DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER WOULD CORRESPOND BY SIGNALS VIZ A RED FLAG FOR POSITIVE AND A BLUE ONE FOR NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY WE SHOULD PROBABLY OBTAIN IN DUE TIME MORE SATISFACTORY CERTAINTY WITH REGARD TO THE ELECTRICITY OF THE CLOUDS THUNDER C THAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN GIVEN OR IS PERHAPS POSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE MAN TO ACQUIRE WITHOUT THE AID OF WIRES OR CHAINS PRODUCED FROM DIFFERENT

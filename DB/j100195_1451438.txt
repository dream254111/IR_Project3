JewishBabylonianAramaic dialect was by no means sealed with the completion of the Babylonian Talmud The Aramaic was alive and spoken by nonJews as well as Jews down to the last days of the Gaonate to be treated elsewhere This Aramaic dialect which I might style the Jewish Nabateanis preserved in the writings of the Geonim in the Seder Olam Zuta Shimusha rabba pinnm sn  l vw in the Gemara to Kalla r the Sheeltot of R Ahail Halakot Pesukot and Halakot Gedolot in the Aramaic commentaries and responsa of the Geonim to which belongs also R Amrams Seder andon the nonrabbinic sidein Anans writings But the linguistic nature of that literature has hitherto been neglected to such an extent that it now becomes imperative to emphasize as strongly as possible the relation and exact nature of this Nabatean dialect andwhat is particularly importantits aid in the explanation of some talmudic words As a contribution along these lines the present article offers disconnected lexical sometimes also textual notes to the abovementioned works my wish being to turn the attention of Semitic scholars to those important linguistic documents 1 See Poznanski in JQR New Series III 405 if 233THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW I begin with Anans writings because they are free from talmudic quotations and hence cannot have been directly influenced by the language of the Talmud I LINGUISTIC REMARKS TO ANANS

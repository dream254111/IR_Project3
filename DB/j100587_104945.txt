OF A LETTER CONCERNING ELECTRI CITY FROM MR B FRANKLIN TO MONS DE LIBARD INCLOSED IN A LETTER TO MR PETER COLLINSON F R S PHILADELPHIA JUNE 29 1755 YOU DESIRE MY OPINION OF PERE BEC CARIAS ITALIAN BOOK I HAVE READ IT WITH MUCH PLEASURE AND THINK IT ONE OF THE BEST PIECES ON THE SUBJECT THAT I HAVE SEEN IN ANY LAN GUAGE YET AS TO THE ARTICLE OF WATERSPOUTS I AM NOT AT PRESENT OF HIS SENTIMENTS THOUGH I MUST OWN WITH YOU THAT HE HAS HANDLED IT VERY INGENIOUSLY MR COLLINSON HAS MY OPINION OF WHIRLWINDS AND VOL 49 R R WATER READ DEC 18 1755306 WATERSPOUTS AT LARGE WRITTEN SOME TIME SINCE I KNOW NOT WHETHER THEY WILL BE PUBLISHED IF NOT I WILL GET THEM TRANSCRIBED FOR YOUR PERUSAL IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT PERE BECCARIA DOUBTS OF THE ABSOLUTE IMPERMEABILITY OF GLASS IN THE SENSE I MEANT IT FOR THE INSTANCES HE GIVES OF HOLES MADE THROUGH GLASS BY THE ELECTRIC STROKE ARE SUCH AS WE HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED AND ONLY SHEW THAT THE ELECTRIC FLUID COULD NOT PASS WITHOUT MAKING A HOLE IN THE SAME MANNER WE SAY GLASS IS IMPERMEABLE TO WATER AND YET A STREAM FROM A FIREENGINE WILL FORCE THROUGH THE STRONGEST PANES OF A WINDOW AS TO THE EFFECT OF POINTS IN DRAWING THE ELECTRIC MATTER FROM CLOUDS AND THEREBY SECURING BUILDINGS C WHICH YOU SAY HE SEEMS TO DOUBT I MUST OWN I THINK HE ONLY SPEAKS MODESTLY AND JUDICIOUSLY I FIND I HAVE BEEN BUT PARTLY UNDERSTOOD IN THAT MATTER I HAVE MENTIONED IT IN SEVERAL OF MY LETTERS AND EXCEPT ONCE ALWAYS IN THE ALTERNATIVE VIZ THAT POINTED RODS ERECTED ON BUILDINGS AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOIST EARTH WOULD EITHER PREVENT A STROKE OR IF NOT PREVENTED WOULD CONDUCT IT SO AS THAT THE BUILDING SHOULD SUFFER NO DAMAGE YET WHENEVER MY OPINION IS EXAMINED IN EUROPE NOTHING IS CONSIDERED BUT THE PROBABILITY OF THOSE RODS PREVENTING A STROKE OR EXPLOSION WHICH IS ONLY A PART OF THE USE I PROPOSED FROM THEM AND THE OTHER PART THEIR CONDUCTING A STROKE WHICH THEY MAY HAPPEN NOT TO PREVENT SEEMS TO BE TOTALLY FORGOTTEN THO OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE AND ADVANTAGE I THANK YOU FOR COMMUNICATING M DE BUFFONS RELATION OF THE EFFECT OF LIGHTNING AT DIJON ON THE 7TH OF JUNE LAST IN RETURN GIVE ME LEAVE TO RELATE AN INSTANCE I LATELY SAW OF THE SAME KIND BEING IN THE 3307 THE TOWN OF NEWBURY IN NEW ENGLAND IN NOVEM BER LAST I WAS SHEWN THE EFFECT OF LIGHTNING ON THEIR CHURCH WHICH HAD BEEN STRUCK A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE STEEPLE WAS A SQUARE TOWER OF WOOD REACHING SEVENTY FEET UP FROM THE GROUND TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BELL HUNG OVER WHICH ROSE A TAPER SPIRE OF WOOD LIKEWISE REACHING SEVENTY FEET HIGHER TO THE VANE OR WEATHERCOCK NEAR THE BELL WAS FIXED AN IRON HAM MER TO STRIKE THE HOURS AND FROM THE TAIL OF THE HAMMER A WIRE WENT DOWN THROUGH A SMALL GIMLET HOLE IN THE FLOOR THAT THE BELL STOOD UPON AND THRO A SECOND FLOOR IN LIKE MANNER THEN HORIZONTALLY UN DER AND NEAR THE PLAISTERED CIELING OF THAT SECOND FLOOR TILL IT CAME NEAR A PLAISTERED WALL THEN DOWN BY THE SIDE OF THAT WALL TO A CLOCK WHICH STOOD ABOUT TWENTY FEET BELOW THE BELL THE WIRE WAS NOT BIGGER THAN A COMMON KNITTING NEEDLE THE SPIRE WAS SPLIT ALL TO PIECES BY THE LIGHTNING AND THE PARTS FLUNG IN ALL DIRECTIONS OVER THE SQUARE IN WHICH THE CHURCH STOOD SO THAT NOTHING REMAINED ABOVE THE BELL THE LIGHTNING PASSED BETWEEN THE HAMMER AND THE CLOCK IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED WIRE WITHOUT HURTING EITHER OF THE FLOORS OR HAVING ANY EFFECT UPON THEM EXCEPT MAKING THE GIMLETHOLES THROUGH WHICH THE WIRE PASSED A LITTLE BIGGER AND WITHOUT HURTING THE PLAISTERED WALL OR ANY PART OF THE BUILDING SO FAR AS THE AFORESAID WIRE AND THE PENDULUM WIRE OF THE CLOCK EXTENDED WHICH LATTER WIRE WAS ABOUT THE THICKNESS OF A GOOSE QUILL FROM THE END OF THE PENDULUM DOWN QUITE TO THE GROUND THE BUILDING WAS EXCEED INGLY RENT AND DAMAGED AND SOME STONES IN THE FOUNDATIONWALL TORN OUT AND THROWN TO THE DISTANCE R R 2 OF308 OF TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET NO PART OF THE AFORE MENTIONED LONG SMALL WIRE BETWEEN THE CLOCK AND THE HAMMER COULD BE FOUND EXCEPT ABOUT TWO INCHES THAT HUNG TO THE TAIL OF THE HAMMER AND ABOUT AS MUCH THAT WAS FASTENED TO THE CLOCK THE REST BEING EXPLODED AND ITS PARTICLES DISSIPATED IN SMOKE AND AIR AS GUNPOWDER IS BY COMMON FIRE AND HAD ONLY LEFT A BLACK SMUTTY TRACK ON THE PLAISTER ING THREE OR FOUR INCHES BROAD DARKEST IN THE MID DLE AND FAINTER TOWARDS THE EDGES ALL ALONG THE CIELING UNDER WHICH IT PASSED AND DOWN THE WALL THESE WERE THE EFFECTS AND APPEARANCES ON WHICH I WOULD ONLY MAKE THE FEW FOLLOWING REMARKS VIZ 1 THAT LIGHTNING IN ITS PASSAGE THROUGH A BUILD ING WILL LEAVE WOOD TO PASS AS FAR AS IT CAN IN METAL AND NOT ENTER THE WOOD AGAIN TILL THE CONDUCTOR OF METAL CEASES AND THE SAME I HAVE OBSERVED IN OTHER INSTANCES AS TO WALLS OF BRICK OR STONE 2 THE QUANTITY OF LIGHTNING THAT PASSED THROUGH THIS STEEPLE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GREAT BY ITS EFFECTS ON THE LOFTY SPIRE ABOVE THE BELL AND ON THE SQUARE TOWER ALL BELOW THE END OF THE CLOCK PENDULUM 3 GREAT AS THIS QUANTITY WAS IT WAS CONDUCTED BY A SMALL WIRE AND A CLOCK PENDULUM WITHOUT THE LEAST DAMAGE TO THE BUILDING SO FAR AS THEY EXTENDED 4 THE PENDULUM ROD BEING OF A SUFFICIENT THICK NESS CONDUCTED THE LIGHTNING WITHOUT DAMAGE TO IT SELF BUT THE SMALL WIRE WAS UTTERLY DESTROYED 5 THOUGH THE SMALL WIRE WAS ITSELF DESTROYED YET IT HAD CONDUCTED THE LIGHTNING WITH SAFETY TO THE BUILDING 6 AND309 6 AND FROM THE WHOLE IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT IF EVEN SUCH A SMALL WIRE HAD BEEN EXTENDED FROM THE SPINDLE OF THE VANE TO THE EARTH BEFORE THE STORM NO DAMAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO THE STEEPLE BY THAT STROKE OF LIGHTNING THOUGH THE WIRE ITSELF HAD BEEN DESTROYED

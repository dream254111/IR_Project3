JurymanTemporary Absence of Juror from CourtCustody of Jury Rebutting Evidence for ProsecutionAdmissibilityThe King v Crippen 1911 1 K B 149 This notorious case has furnished a legal precedent on two somewhat important points 1 on the second day of the trial a juryman was taken ill and was taken out of court but not out of the building accompanied by two doctors and an usher to a part of the building to which the public had no access After a consultation one of the doctors reported to the court when the juryman was likely to recover and the court adjourned for a short time and the doctor was sworn to take care of the juror during the adjournment He then returned to the juror and he and the other doctor and the usher remained with him in the open air in rear of the courthouse enclosure for threequarters of an hour the usher having been with him the whole time he was absent from the rest of the jury The usher had been sworn on the first day of the trial to take charge of the jury but he was not sworn to take charge of the sick juror During the whole time of the latters absence no one spoke to him about the trial The doctors spoke to him but no oth ers On the way to the open air less than a dozen persons had to be passed but the juror was in a state of collapse and not able to com municate with anyone The Court of Criminal Appeal Darling Channell and Pickford JJ held that these facts furnished no ground for quashing the conviction 2 It was also urged on the prisoners behalf that rebutting evidence admitted on behalf of the prosecution after the close of the defence was inadmissible but the Court of Appeal held that was a matter of judicial discretion and that the exercise of such discretion would not be interfered with un less it was exercised in a way which obviously resulted in some in justice to the accusedCanada Law Journal Conviction as Evidence in Civil ProceedingsIn In re Cunigunda alias Cora Crippen on February 13 Sir Samuel Evans gave a considered decision on the claim of Ethel Le Neve as execu trix of Dr Crippen to be appointed administratrix of the doctors wife After deciding that under section 73 of the Court of Probate Act 1857 the Court had and should exercise a discretion under the special circumstances to refuse the grant to Miss Le Neve the learned Judge dealt fully with the question raised whether the con viction of Dr Crippen for the murder of his wife was admissible in evidence in the probate proceedings This question was certainly material pn the point whether persons claiming under the husband could take any interest in the estate of the wife of whose murder he 170 June1911 NOTES OF CASES 171 had been convicted If his guilt were established it is clear that no rights in respect of the wifes estate accrued to him or through him Cleaver v Mutual Reserve Fund Association Ltd L R 1892 1 Q B 147 Amicable Society v Bolland 4 Bligh N S 194 But is a certificate of conviction of murder sufficient to defeat a proceed ing to establish the civil claims of the representatives of the mur derer on the estate of the victim It has been considered that for civil purposes a conviction of crime is res inter alio acta being an adjudication between the Crown and the criminal and not between the criminal and another of the Kings subjects This is the view expressed by Bramwell L J in Leyman v Latimer L R 3 Cr D 352 and suggested in the opinion of the judges in Castrique v Imrie L R 4 H L 414 Sir Samuel Evans after considering these and the numerous authorities referred to in Taylor on Evidence 7th ed vol 2 s 1693 came to the conclusion that they did not cover the point raised before him and relying on the Duchess of Kingstons Case 2 Smith Leading Cases 10th ed 713 714 he came to the conclusion that a certificate of conviction of murder was admissible in evidence not merely as proof of the fact of con viction but as presumptive proof of the commission of the crime and that the conclusion of the jury was well founded He declined to be bound by the decision in the Palatine Chancery Court arising out of the Wark case Vater z KyffinTaylor W N 1899 141 In the case under discussion the fact of conviction was peculiarly relevant inasmuch as the title of Miss Le Neve to represent Dr Crippen arose out of the fact of his execution for the murder of his wife and Miss Le Neves claim was to obtain administration of the estate of the person murdered by the testator under whose will she obtained her representative title Sir Samuel Evans seems to have considered that in such a case the conviction bound the representa tive of the executed murderer and could not be described as res inter alios acta but his ruling is limited to cases in which a con victed felon or his representative seeks by civil proceedings to en force rights accruing to the felon or his representative from the commission of the crimeW F C in London Law Journal

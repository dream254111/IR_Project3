AMERICAN PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION LEAGUE CALLS PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE NUMEROUS DEFECTS OF OUR PRESENT SYSTEM OF REPRESENTATION WHICH DIVIDES THE COMMUNITY INTO DISTRICTS EACH ELECTING ONE MEMBER TO OUR VARIOUS DELIBERATIVE BODIES MUNICIPAL LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL  I BY THIS SYSTEM EVERY MEMBER OF A MINORITY PARTY IN EACH DISTRICT REMAINS POLITICALLY UNREPRESENTED THERE IS A VAST AND UNNECESSARY WASTE OF VOTES CAST FOR DEFEATED CANDIDATES 2 IT DEPENDS WHOLLY UPON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DISTRICTS ANDOFTEN UPON MERE CHANCE WHETHER THE WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE REFLECTED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OFTEN BY MEANS OF THE GERRYMANDER THE POPULAR WILL IS PURPOSELY THWARTED BY THOSE IN TEMPORARY POSSESSION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECURING LARGE AND UNFAIR MAJORITIES AND OF RETAINING PERMANENT CON TROL OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY 538 178PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION CONFERENCE 179  3 MEN WHO THINK ALIKE AND DESIRE TO VOTE TOGETHER ARE PREVENTED FROM COOPERAT ING BY ARBITRARY DISTRICT LINES AND BY THE SAME MEANS VOTERS ARE THROWN TOGETHER WHO ARE NOT LIMITED BY COMMON SENTIMENTS AND INTERESTS AND WHO CANNOT PROPERLY SELECT ANY COMMON REPRESENTATIVE  4 BY CREATING CLOSELY CONTESTED DISTRICTS WHERE THE CHANGE OF A FEW VOTES WILL ALTER THE RESULT THE PRESENT SYSTEM FURNISHES SPECIAL FACILITIES FOR CARRYING ELEC TIONS BY THE BRIBERY OF A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF ELECTORS  5 THE ELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM SMALL DISTRICTS LEADS TO THE SELECTION OF SMALL MEN AVAILABLE CANDIDATES OF WEAK CONVICTIONS POOR TALENTS WHEREBY THE CHARACTER OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY IS GREATLY IMPAIRED 6 IN PLACE OF THE DISTRICT SYSTEM THE CONFERENCE OF THE LEAGUE HELD AT SARA TOGA AUGUST 27 I895 INVITES CONSIDERATION OF THE SYSTEM NOW IN OPERATION IN SEVERAL OF THE SWISS CANTONS WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE DIVIDED INTO LARGE CONSTITUEN CIES EACH ONE OF THESE ELECTING A NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES BY MEANS OF PROPOR TIONAL REPRESENTATION THE ENTIRE VOTE IN EACH CONSTITUENCY IS DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS TO BE ELECTED FROM EACH THIS GIVES THE QUOTA OF REPRESENTA TION OR THE NUMBER OF VOTERS WHO ARE ENTITLED TO ONE REPRESENTATIVE EACH PARTY THEN RECEIVES AS MANY REPRESENTATIVES AS IT HAS QUOTAS IN THE VOTE POLLED THE CANDIDATES IN THE LIST OF EACH PARTY WHO RECEIVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES ARE THE ONES RETURNED ANY CANDIDATE RECEIVING AN INDEPENDENT NOMINATION IS TREATED AS A SEPARATE PARTY THIS CONFERENCE RECOMMENDS THE SWISS SYSTEM AS APPLICABLE TO OUR INSTITUTIONS AND TO OUR PRESENT AUSTRALIAN SYSTEM OF VOTING IT HAS BEEN FOUND PRACTICALLY SUCCESSFUL AFTER THE TRIAL OF FOUR YEARS IN SWITZERLAND WHERE IT HAS GIVEN A JUST SYSTEM OF REPRESENTATION AND HAS ELEVATED THE CHARACTER OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLIES  7 THE SWISS SYSTEM SECURES GREATER LIBERTY TO THE VOTER BY ALLOWING HIM TO CHOOSE HIS CANDIDATE FROM ALL PARTS OF A LARGE CONSTITUENCY INSTEAD OF FROM A SMALL ONE ELECTING A SINGLE MEMBER IT REQUIRES JUST REPRESENTATION IT MAKES THE GERRYMANDER IMPOSSIBLE IT LESSENS CORRUPTION IT GREATLY DIMINISHES THE NUMBER OF WASTED VOTES AND THE DISAFFECTION OF A HOPELESS MINORITY AND IT SECURES MEN OF GREATER INDEPENDENCE AND HIGHER CHARACTER FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY  WE ESPECIALLY RECOMMEND THIS SYSTEM FOR EARLY ADOPTION IN OUR VARIOUS MUNI CIPAL ELECTIONS A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF PROFESSOR COMMONS MR COOLEY AND PROFESSOR JENKS WAS APPOINTED TO EXAMINE INTO THE SWISS METHODS AND THE PROPER PLAN OF ADAPTING THEM TO THE AUSTRALIAN BALLOT SYSTEM AND TO OUR INSTITUTIONS AND THE COMMITTEE WAS AUTHORIZED

THE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OF OUR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE HAS BECOME VERY LARGE AND THEIR MEETINGS VERY FREQUENT THE GATHERINGS OF SUCH ASSOCIATIONS HOWEVER ARE ATTENDED CHIEFLY BY PERSONS WHO MAKE MORE OR LESS OF A PROFESSION OF EITHER THE SCIENCE OR ART OF THE RESPECTIVE SUBJECTS THEY DO NOT OF COURSE FURNISH AN ADEQUATE INDEX OF THE PUBLIC OR POPULAR INTEREST IN SUCH QUESTIONS THE FACT HOWEVER OF SUCH AN INTEREST IS PROVEN BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF CLASSES AND CLUBS FORMED IN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES FOR THE STUDY OF SOME ONE OR ANOTHER OF THE GREAT QUESTIONS OF THEORY OR PRACTICE WHICH VEX OUR MODERN SOCIETY AND THE STUDENTS BELONGING TO THESE CLASSES OR GROUPS FIND IT NECESSARY AT SOME TIME IN THE YEAR IF POSSIBLE TO MEET WITH OTHER LIKEMINDED PERSONS FOR A LONGER OR SHORTER SESSION OF SERIOUS STUDY OF SUCH PROBLEMS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF EXPERTS THUS THE VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS OR INSTITUTIONS WHICH PROVIDE FOR SUMMER MEETINGS FIND IT NECESSARY TO INCREASE STEADILY THE SHARE OF

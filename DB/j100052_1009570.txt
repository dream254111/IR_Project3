3Ist of the current year In contrast to the last session at Chicago the members were more numerous than the guests It must be reck oned a success of the Berne session that nearly seventyfive of the members took part in the meetings The sessions were followed with great interest by the economists and statisticians of Switzerland a con siderable number of whom were present as guests Berne is moreover in some respects a most suitable place for such gatherings The town offers but few distractions and thus favors the social intercourse which counts for so much The proceedings of the congress were in general sessions and in meetings of four sections treating respectively population trade agriculture and social statistics The program of the general assembly follows MONDAY AUGUST 26 Opening

by title Absent 535 I75176 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY was very little worthy of special notice in this feature of the proceed ings The only exception to this statement was the short address of Mr Herman Hollerith of Washington the inventor of the electrical census machine After the paper of Dr Rauchberg who praised the excellencies of the machine Mr Hollerith gave a brief statement of the points in the machine which seemed capable of improvement The invention has solved many knotty problems in statistical processes and Mr Holleriths remarks were attentively followed and generously applauded Certain of the resolutions adopted by the assembly were of general interest Upon the motion of Neymarck Paris a committee was ap pointed to examine the variations in the value of personal property and on the motion of Yvernds Paris a committee on the statistics of divorce In his opening address the President had alluded to the diffi culties in the action of international committees and in the sections many members complained of the inefficiency of such an organiza tion Toward the latter part of the session the general assembly was reluctant to name new committees Those who requested the forma tion of committees were therefore charged by the Institute with the presentation of reports at subsequent meetings on their own responsi bility after as much or as little consultation as they might desire with those members of the Institute who might be especially competent to aid in the work It was hoped in this manner to secure more con tinuity in the labors of the Institute than had been accomplished through the organization of committees The Section on Social Statistics took important action on the subject of wage statistics and the use of alcoholic liquors TnamaSternegg called attention to the inadequacy of the previous Vienna resolutions to secure good statistics of wages He contended that the statistics of wages should be comprehensive that is include all laborers for a given industry or a given district He reported that such wage statis tics were in contemplation in Austria and would soon be undertaken While the section could not approve of his propositions in their entire rigor it was generally recognized that European wage statistics were for the greater part constructed on too narrow a basis and with the formulation that such statistics should be as comprehensive as possible the section approved the propositions of the distinguished Chief of the Austrian Statistics Director Milliet of the Swiss Alcohol Administration proposed an international investigation into the statistics of the production and consumption of alcoholic liquors He presented an elaborate formula the purpose of which was to probe into these much quoted and very dubious figures in order to form an appreciation of their statistical 536PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION CONFERENCE I77 value After careful discussion and verbal amendment in the section it was favorably reported to the general assembly and there adopted It is impossible here to pick out more than a few salient points in a program which was remarkably rich No sketch of the meeting could pretend to completeness which did not report on the interest ing work done in the sections on population commerce and agricul ture which in their respective fields demonstrated anew that the progress of international statistics though slow could be accomplished by patient effort Limited space permits only a reference In the first session of the Institute the following persons were elected to membership Geering Berne Guyot Paris Mahielon Brussels Struve St Petersburg Crupenski Bucharest Moron Paris Timiria zer St Petersburg de Verschuer Hague and Julin Brussels At the closing session the officers of the

August 27 and 28 At the opening meeting at Io a m on August 27 the Hon William Dudley Foulke President of the Proportional Representation League delivered the opening address This was followed by the reading of a paper submitted by the Hon Leonard Courtney M P of London in which he set forth the principles which were below the recent politi cal overturn in England The following committee was then ap pointed to take into consideration the various plans of proportional representation Hon William D Foulke Hon Simon Sterne Mr William H Gove Mr M N Forney and Professor John R Com mons Another committee consisting of Mr W E Gates Mr Stoughton Cooley and Mr M N Forey was appointed to consider the ways and means of bringing proportional representation before the public A communication was read from the Secretary of State in Wash ington written in reply to one from the secretary of the conference requesting that the United States consuls in Switzerland Belgium Denmark and England should report on the methods of securing proportional representation adopted in those countries The letter stated that the consuls had been instructed to make such reports and the results of the investigations would be communicated to the Proportional Representation League Letters were then read relating to the progress proportional repre sentation has made and the methods which have been adopted and 537ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY are proposed in Europe These letters were from Sir John Lubbock M P London Herr R Siegfried Koenigsberg Prussia M Charles Burkley Zurich M Ernest Naville Geneva M Jules Carlier Brussels I Jules Gfeller Berne and M T Curie Versailles Letters concerning the progress of proportional representation in this country were received from Mrs Sophie E Carlton of Berkeley Cal Mr John H Cain of Cincinnati Mr Lucius F C Garvin of Lonsdale R I Mr George P Carroll of Bridgeport Conn and Dr M R Leverson of Port Richmond Staten Island N Y A resolution was adopted to appoint a committee to form a central circulating library of proportional representation literature the books to be sent through the mails to members Mr W H Gove Dr M R Leverson and Professor J W Jenks were appointed At the afternoon session Hon Simon Sterne of New York de livered an address in which the evils of the existing electoral system were set forth He stated that the advocates of proportional repre sentation must go before the public with a concrete embodiment of a method for securing proportional representation He then explained at considerable length the DHondt system proposed to the Belgian Parliament Mr Gove then read a paper on Some Principles Underlying Proportional Representation At the morning session on August 28 Mr William E Gates of Cleveland O read a paper on The Adaptation of the Free List System to American Conditions  Mr Foulke then presented reso lutions intended to give a succinct statement of the reasons why the reform is demanded Mr Sterne argueld against a single vote for candidates which was proposed and in favor of a plural vote Dr Leverson argued in favor of the Hare plan and if that was not acceptable he advocated the Gove plan Mr Gove was in favor of the single vote Professor Commons argued for the adoption of the Swiss system with the plural vote The resolutions and addresses were finally adopted in the following form The American Proportional Representation League calls public attention to the numerous defects of our present system of representation which divides the community into districts each electing one member to our various deliberative bodies municipal legislative and Congressional  i By this system every member of a minority party in each district remains politically unrepresented There is a vast and unnecessary waste of votes cast for defeated candidates 2 It depends wholly upon the construction of the districts andoften upon mere chance whether the wishes of the majority of the people are reflected by the representative body Often by means of the gerrymander the popular will is purposely thwarted by those in temporary possession of legislative power for the purpose of securing large and unfair majorities and of retaining permanent con trol of the representative body 538 178PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION CONFERENCE 179  3 Men who think alike and desire to vote together are prevented from cooperat ing by arbitrary district lines and by the same means voters are thrown together who are not limited by common sentiments and interests and who cannot properly select any common representative  4 By creating closely contested districts where the change of a few votes will alter the result the present system furnishes special facilities for carrying elec tions by the bribery of a small percentage of electors  5 The election of representatives from small districts leads to the selection of small men available candidates of weak convictions poor talents whereby the character of the representative body is greatly impaired 6 In place of the district system the Conference of the League held at Sara toga August 27 I895 invites consideration of the system now in operation in several of the Swiss cantons where the people are divided into large constituen cies each one of these electing a number of representatives by means of propor tional representation The entire vote in each constituency is divided by the number of members to be elected from each This gives the quota of representa tion or the number of voters who are entitled to one representative Each party then receives as many representatives as it has quotas in the vote polled The candidates in the list of each party who receive the highest number of votes are the ones returned Any candidate receiving an independent nomination is treated as a separate party This Conference recommends the Swiss system as applicable to our institutions and to our present Australian system of voting It has been found practically successful after the trial of four years in Switzerland where it has given a just system of representation and has elevated the character of legislative assemblies  7 The Swiss system secures greater liberty to the voter by allowing him to choose his candidate from all parts of a large constituency instead of from a small one electing a single member It requires just representation it makes the gerrymander impossible it lessens corruption it greatly diminishes the number of wasted votes and the disaffection of a hopeless minority and it secures men of greater independence and higher character for the representative body  We especially recommend this system for early adoption in our various muni cipal elections A committee consisting of Professor Commons Mr Cooley and Professor Jenks was appointed to examine into the Swiss methods and the proper plan of adapting them to the Australian ballot system and to our institutions and the committee was authorized to pub lish the same for purposes of information only The same officers of the American Proportional Representation League were reelected as follows President Hon William Dudley Poulke of Richmond Ind VicePresidents Mr Charles Francis Adams of Boston Hon T L Johnson of Cleveland 0 and Mr William Lloyd Garrison of Boston Secretary and Treasurer Mr Stoughton Cooley of Chicago In addition to the

waterway for ships out of the Erie canal At the afternoon session a number of short speeches were made by some of the prominent delegates The Committee on Resolutions then made its report through its chairman Mr L E Cooley The resolutions adopted by the convention are as follows Recognizing the supreme utility of deep waterways through the great lakes and thence to the sea and reaffirming in full the platform adopted at the organ izing convention held at Toronto in I894 the International Deep Waterways Association in first convention assembled declares as follows x That the public welfare demands the deepest practicable channels between the several lakes and to the seaboard to enable vessels of the most economical type to pass between lake ports or between the lakes and the seaboard or to foreign waters without the necessity of transshipment 2 That the said requirements call for a least depth of twentyone feet in all channels and the building of all permanent structures for a navigable depth of twentysix feet or more in order that the water courses may be progressively and economically deepened to the ultimate necessities of traffic 3 That the prompt action of the Congress of the United States and the govern ment of the Dominion of Canada providing for a joint commission to investigate and report upon the establishment and maintenance of deep water between the great lakes and the sea conformably to the resolution adopted at Toronto in x194 is a matter for congratulation and that in view of the extended scope and great importance of the subjects to be examined by the said commission this convention urges that the most liberal provision be made for the necessary expenses 4 That the broadening of the channels through the connecting shallows between Lakes Erie and Huron and Lakes Huron and Superior as recommended by lake carriers is urgently demanded by the interests of commerce and is in line with the progressive development of a great trunk water route 5 That the international interest in the great fresh water seas of the American continent and in the ship routesjoining them to the ocean is recognized and that the use of their waters and the control of their levels are proper subjects for inter national regulations 6 That pending the development of the best deep channel or channels to the ocean the promised early completion by the Canadian government of the St Lawrence canals if possible with lengthened locks will result in marked benefit to international commerce and to the producers of the interior likewise that the movement in the State of New York toward lessening the cost of transportation to tide water by improving the Erie canal which must have a permanent value is noted with satisfaction by this convention 7 That with respect to the several resolutions offered concerning local canal projects all enterprises designed to extend marine commerce through lateral routes tributary to the great lakes system are to be encouraged That this convention calls special and renewed attention to the desirability of establishing a permanent international court as set forth in the organizing con vention in Toronto in i894

or less of a profession of either the science or art of the respective subjects they do not of course furnish an adequate index of the public or popular interest in such questions The fact however of such an interest is proven by the large number of classes and clubs formed in the various communities for the study of some one or another of the great questions of theory or practice which vex our modern society and the students belonging to these classes or groups find it necessary at some time in the year if possible to meet with other likeminded persons for a longer or shorter session of serious study of such problems under the direction of experts Thus the various associations or institutions which provide for summer meetings find it necessary to increase steadily the share of attention given to the subjects under discussion Such an institution as Chicago University which undertakes to carry on its regular educational work through four quarters in the year provides of course opportunities for the study of economics 546 i86VACATION COURSES IN ECONOMICS AND POLITICS 187 and politics during the three summer months in the same generous way as during the other threequarters of the year The various Chautauqua assemblies now held in so many different States find it necessary to make special and liberal provision for lectures and courses in this department and a full report of the work which they are doing can be found in the official publications of that group of organizations In addition to these facilities for the pursuit of such subjects during the vacation there were in the summer of 1895 three notable centres for such study namely the University Extension Summer Meeting at Oxford England the corresponding American meeting at the University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia and the School of Applied Ethics at Plymouth Mass Vacation Courses in Economnics and Politics at Oxford The following statement of courses in Economics and Politics given at Oxford during the University Extension Summer Meeting has been furnished by Mr J A R Marriott secretary to the delegates AVER NO OF AGE NO LECTURER NAME OF COURS LEC OF STU TURFS DENTS Graham Wallas

attendance is kept the figures in the last column are therefore only approximately correct but they serve to illustrate what is otherwise remarkable the very great interest which is taken in the study of economics Each year of late we have given to economics a more and more prominent place in our program of summer meeting studies and each year our students I think I may affirm with confidence have shown themselves more and more eager to avail themselves of the lectures provided for them The general idea underlying the arrangement of courses at the present summer meeting has been this First during the earlier portion of the meet ing to lay a foundation of economic history in relation to the eigh teenth century and then in the latter part to follow this up by a course of more advanced lectures on the development of economic theory between Adam Smiths day and our own Cost theory of value theory of rent wages capital and interest division of labor free trade wealth 547I88 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The London School of Economics and Political Science an account of which was given in the September number of the ANNALS proposes to organize a similar series of vacation studies for next year in London Vacation Courses in Economics and Politics at Philadelphia The American Society for the Extension of University Teaching recognized from the very first inception of its work that as the education of the citizen was perhaps as good a formulation of the general idea underlying the extension movement as could be made so in its work special facilities should be provided for the study of economics and politics Its first President Professor Edmund J James was known for his interest in the better training of our citizens in such subjects One of the first staff lectureships established by the society was that in Economics filled by the appointment of Dr Edward T Devine who subsequently became Secretary of the Society The growing recognition on the part of the Society that its work must to a large extent consist of efforts to broaden and deepen the conception of the education of the citizen was seen in the conversion of its official publications entitled The University Extension Magazine and The University Extension Bulletin into a periodical entitled The Citizen When the society found it necessary to organize a Summer Meeting it made liberal provision from the very beginning for the new subjects of study and the session which was held during July at the University of Pennsylvania gave special emphasis to the work in Civics and Politics

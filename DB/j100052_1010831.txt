DAVIS CHIEF ENGINEER UNITED STATES RECLAMATION SERVICE WHEN THE PRESIDENT APPROVED ON JUNE 17 1902 A BILL KNOWN AS THE RECLAMATION ACT THE UNITED STATES ENTERED UPON A POLICY OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT ALONG NOVEL LINES MANY MILLIONS HAVE BEEN SPENT UPON INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS BUT NONE OF THEM ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS THAT IS THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE EXPENDED FUNDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REQUIRED TO RETURN THE COST OF THE IMPROVEMENTS AS IS REQUIRED BY THE RECLAMATION ACT THE PRELIMINARY STAGE OF SURVEY AND EXAMINATION FOR THE SELECTION OF PROJECTS IS NOW PRACTICALLY PASSED THE SECOND STAGE OF CONSTRUCTION IS WELL ADVANCED AND LARGE AREAS OF LAND HAVE BEEN PLACED UNDER IRRIGATION THE THIRD STAGE THAT OF SETTLING THE VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH PROSPEROUS SETTLERS AND COLLECTING FROM THEM THE COST OF THE WORKS HAS JUST BEEN ENTERED UPON THE NOVELTY OF THIS FEATURE TOGETHER WITH OTHER IMPORTANT OBSTACLES CONSTITUTES THIS THIRD STAGE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL IN ALL TWENTYSIX PROJECTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE SECRE TARY OF THE INTERIOR AND CONSTRUCTION HAS COMMENCED ON TWENTY FIVE OF THESE SEVERAL HAVING BEEN NEARLY COMPLETED ON THE PAS SAGE OF THE LAW A SUM OF MONEY AMOUNTING TO NEARLY 5000000 WAS MADE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE BY THE TERMS OF THE ACT DURING THE STAGE OF ORGANIZATION SURVEY AND EXAMINATION THE EXPENDI TURES WERE RELATIVELY LIGHT AND THE FUND CONTINUED TO ACCUMULATE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW BY THE SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS IN THE WEST AS CONSTRUCTION WAS UNDERTAKEN HOWEVER THE EXPENDITURES INCREASED AND AS NEW PROJECTS WERE TAKEN UP THE INCREMENTS AUG MENTED UNTIL NOW THE ACCUMULATED FUNDS HAVE PRACTICALLY BEEN EXHAUSTED AND DURING THE FUTURE YEARS THE OUTLAY WILL PROBABLY BE GOVERNED BY THE CURRENT RECEIPTS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES 203204 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN A1CADEMY SALT RIVER PROJECT ARIZONA ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO BEGAN A SERIES OF YEARS OF UNUSUALLY LARGE RUNOFF IN THE SALT RIVER BASIN IN ARIZONA THE SUCCESSIVE HIGHWATER PERIODS SHOWING A LARGE AMOUNT OF SURPLUS RUNOFF YEAR AFTER YEAR ATTRACTED PUBLIC ATTENTION AND ENCOURAGED THE CON STRUCTION OF CANALS AND DEVELOPMENT OF IRRIGATION UNTIL THESE ENTER PRISES REACHED FAR BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF THE RIVER IN ORDINARY YEARS IN 1898 LIKE THE BACKWARD SWING OF THE PENDULUM BEGAN A SERIES OF UNPRECEDENTED DRY YEARS THE RUNOFF FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEING BELOW THE YIELD DURING THE RECOLLECTION OF THE OLDEST INHAB ITANT THE HOT ARID CLIMATE MAKES ALL CROPS ABSOLUTELY DEPENDENT UPON IRRIGATION IN THIS REGION AND LONGCONTINUED DROUGHT LED TO THE DEATH OF LARGE AND VALUABLE ORCHARDS VINEYARDS AND ALFALFA FIELDS UPON WHICH GREAT EXPENDITURES HAD BEEN MADE IN ATTEMPT ING TO SAVE PROPERTY IN ALL PARTS OF THE VALLEY HARDSHIP WAS CAUSED EVEN TO THE OLDEST IRRIGATORS WITH THE BEST WATER RIGHTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE LEGISLATURE OF ARIZONA PROVIDED FOR PRE LIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS OF THE FEASIBILITY OF WATER STORAGE ON UPPER SALT RIVER WHICH WERE CARRIED OUT IN COOPERATION WITH THE GEO LOGICAL SURVEY IN 901O A LARGE AND FEASIBLE RESERVOIR SITE WAS SURVEYED AND A FOUNDATION FOR A DAM EXPLORED WITH DIAMOND DRILLS UNUSUAL DIFFICULTIES WERE PRESENTED BY THE ISOLATION OF THE LOCALITY AND THE EXTREME ROUGHNESS OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WHICH WAS OF A VOLCANIC ORIGIN AND SCORED BY PROFOUND BOX CAN YONS THOSE CONDITIONS MADE IT EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO IMPORT LARGE QUANTITIES OF HEAVY ARTICLES SUCH AS CEMENT AND FUEL INVES TIGATIONS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF SUITABLE MATERIALS FOR THE MANU FACTURE OF CEMENT AT THE DAM SITE BUT THE LARGE QUANTITY OF FUEL REQUIRED FOR THE NECESSARY POWER FOR MANUFACTURING THE CEMENT AND BUILDING THE DAM PRESENTED GREAT DIFFICULTIES THE LITTLE WOOD THAT WAS AVAILABLE WAS SCATTERED AND OF POOR QUALITY IT WAS DE CIDED TO DEVELOP WATER POWER BY DIVERTING THE RIVER AND CARRYING IT THROUGH CANALS AND TUNNELS FOR A DISTANCE OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILES AND DROPPING IT ABOUT 250 FEET THE TOWNS OF PHOENIX AND MESA COOPERATED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A ROAD BY ISSUING OVER 70000 IN BONDS FOR THE PURPOSE FUEL OIL IMPORTED FROM CALIFORNIA IS FREIGHTED FROM MESA OVER THIS ROAD THIS OIL IS USED IN THE KILNS0 BO V3 0 T4 C EUK U T INE ECO KO EO RECLAMATION OF ARID WVEST 205 FOR BURNING CEMENT AND WATER POWER IS USED TO RUN MACHINERY IIN THE CEMENT MILL AND TO HANDLE THE ROCK AND MORTAR FOR THE DAM THE LITTLE SAND THAT OCCURS IN THIS VICINITY IS BADLY MIXED WITH ADOBE MUD AND IS OF VERY POOR QUALITY IT WAS FOUND THAT A MUCH HIGHER GRADE OF SAND COULD BE MANUFACTURED BY CRUSHING DOLOMITE WHICH OCCURS CONVENIENTLY NEAR THE DAM SITE AND A MILL WAS ERECTED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE VARIOUS MILLS AND BUILD INGS LARGE QUANTITIES OF LIME WERE USED WHICH WERE ALSO BURNED AT THE DAM SITE SUCH WORKS AS THOSE ALWAYS REQUIRE LARGE QUAN TITIES OF LUMBER FOR CONCRETE FORMS AND TEMPORARY WORKS OF VARIOUS KINDS IT WAS FOUND FEASIBLE TO INSTALL A SAWMILL IN THE NEIGH BORING MOUNTAINS FOR THIS PURPOSE AND ABOUT 3000000 FEET OF LUMBER HAVE BEEN SAWED AND DELIVERED UPON THE WORK THE DAM ON SALT RIVER IS TO BE BUILT JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF TONTO CREEK WHERE THE RIVER FLOWS THROUGH A PROFOUND GORGE FROM FOUNDATION TO COPING THE DAM WILL BE ABOUT 280 FEET HIGH AND THE RESERVOIR WILL HAVE A CAPACITY OF ABOUT I300OOO ACRE FEET THE POWER DEVELOPED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DAM WILL AFTER ITS COMPLETION BE TRANSFERRED TO THE VALLEY FOR PUMPING WATER FROM WELLS TO INCREASE THE WATER SUPPLY FOR IRRIGATION ARRANGE MENTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE FOR TRANSFERRING A PORTION OF THIS POWER TO THE GILA RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION FOR SUPPLYING THE INDIANS WITH IRRIGATION WATER BY PUMPING THE CONTRACT FOR THIS DAM WAS LET TO JAMES OROURKE AND COM PANY OF GALVESTON TEXAS IN APRIL 19O5 SINCE THE CONTRACTOR BEGAN WORK AN UNPRECEDENTED SERIES OF EXCESSIVE FLOODS HAVE GREATLY HAMPERED THE WORK HAVING WASHED OUT THE CONTRACTORS COFFERDAM FOUR SUCCESSIVE TIMES AND FILLED UP EXCAVATED PORTIONS OF THE FOUN DATION THE CONTRACTOR HAS HOWEVER SUCCEEDED IN PLACING THE FOUNDATION IN THE RIVER AND BRINGING THE UPSTREAM PORTION OF IT TO THE TOP OF HIS COFFERDAM SO THAT SUCH DISASTERS ARE NOT TO BE FEARED IN THE FUTURE THE GREAT FLOOD OF NOVEMBER 1905 ALSO WASHED OUT THE ARI ZONA DAM JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF VERDE RIVER WHICH SERVED AS A DIVERSION DAM FOR THE ARIZONA CANAL AND THE OTHER CANALS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF SALT RIVER THIS NORTHSIDE SYSTEM WAS PUR CHASED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR WITH RECLAMATION FUNDS IN 19O6 AND A CONCRETE DAM FOR DIVERTING WATER INTO IT IS BEING CONSTRUCTED AT A GRANITE REEF BELOW THE OLD

83000 ACRES OF LAND AND THE ONE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT 17000 ACRES THE PROJECT PROVIDES FOR AN EFFI CIENT MEANS OF SLUICING OUT THE HEAD OF THE CANAL BY UTILIZING THE FALL SECURED BY THE DAM THE DAM WILL HAVE A TOTAL LENGTH OF 4780 FEET A MAXIMUM WIDTH OF 257 FEET AND A MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF 19 FEET THE WORK ON THE DAM WAS BEGUN JULY 20 1905 BUT THE CONTRACTORS MADE SLOW PROGRESS AND IT WAS FINALLY TAKEN UP BY THE GOVERNMENT UNDER FORCE ACCOUNT ONE OF THE CHIEF DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED WAS THE TRANSPORTA TION OF FUEL AND OTHER SUPPLIES FROM THE RAILROAD TO THE DAM SITE THE ROADS WERE VERY BAD AND THE NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER SO POOR THAT IT WAS FREQUENTLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE MACHINERY SUPPLIED WITH FUEL IT IS NOW THE INTENTION TO BUILD A RAILROAD FROM THE MAIN LINE OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC TO THE DAM SITE ON THE CALIFORNIA SIDE OF THE RIVER AS SOON AS THIS IS COMPLETED WORK WILL BE ACTIVELY PUSHED ON THE DAM AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT SOME WATER WILL BE TURNED INTO CANALS IN 19O8 THOUGH THE FULL

A TUNNEL THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN RANGE TO BRING WATER FROM THE GUNNISON RIVER INTO THE UNCOMPAHGRE VALLEY THE LENGTH OF THE TUNNEL IS 30515 FEET AND THE WORKS INCLUDE A NUMBER OF SMALL TUNNELS AND A GREAT DEAL OF HEAVY CONSTRUCTION IN CANALS THROUGH ROUGH COUNTRY THE CONTRACT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAIN TUNNEL WAS LET IN 1904 TO THE TAYLORMOORE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY BUT FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES CAUSED ITS ABANDONMENT BY THE CONTRACTOR ON MAY 27 1905 SINCE THAT TIME IT HAS BEEN PROSECUTED BY DAY LABOR UNDER THE ENGINEERS OF THE RECLAMATION SERVICE THE WORK HAS PRESENTED A GREAT MANY DIFFICULTIES FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THE WESTERN HALF OF THE TUNNEL FOLLOWS ALMOST DIRECTLY UNDER THE BED OF CEDAR CREEK WHICH IS COMPOSED OF LOOSE SAND GRAVEL AND MUD IN MAY 1905 THIS CHANNEL BROKE THROUGH THE CONTRACTORS TEMPORARY TIMBERING CAUSING AN EXTENSIVE CAVEIN AND RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF SIX PERSONS IN AUGUST 19O7 CEDAR CREEK BROKE THROUGH THE LINING OF THE TUNNEL AT TWO

WAS GREATLY DELAYED FROM THIS CAUSE BUT THE WATER WAS DRAINED OUT AND THE TUNNEL WAS CLEARED OF GAS SO THAT WORK WAS AGAIN RESUMED SMALLER QUANTITIES OF GAS HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN STRUCK IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE TUNNEL CAUSING DANGER AND DELAY BUT NO LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST THEREBY ON JULY 16 1907 A HEAVY FLOW OF WATER WAS ENCOUNTERED AT THE EASTERN HEADING WHICH FLOODED THE MACHINERY AND DROVE THE MEN FROM WORK IT WAS MORE THAN A MONTH BEFORE WORK COULD BE RESUMED AT THIS HEADING LARGE QUANTITIES OF WATER HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED FROM TIME TO TIME IN BOTH HEADINGS ALWAYS CAUSING DELAY

solid such as clay wet sand wax tallow lead etc is a phenomenon of considerable interest to elasticians not only because of the natural interest attaching to this remarkable class of solids but primarily because it is only during the very slow motions of these solids that it is possible to sharply distin guish them from the class of ultraviscous liquids It is possible to conceive of a per fectly plastic solid which as an ideal body is altogether free from viscosity just as we may conceive of a theoretical elastic solid or of an ideal perfect fluid It is not so easy however to secure experimental data upon which one may base his theoret ical investigation of the motions of plastic solids and by which his conclusions may be tested It occurred to me a few years ago that the kinetoscope offered a ready means of se curing almost any desired magnification of the rate of these slow motions and thus pre sented to us a method of securing the lines of flow and rates of motion for any desired case The method that I selected for that purpose was as follows Let the moving body be photographed upon kinetoscope film at stated intervalsevery few minutes or every few hours as the case may require After a sufficient number of these photo graphs have been obtained the film may be run through an ordinary projecting kinet oscope at the usual rate In this way the motion that has required several weeks for 535 its production may be reproduced upon the screen within the limits of a few minutes or seconds I have magnified in this way the rate of motion about 500000 fold but of course there is no major limit to the possi ble rate of magnification I made the first application of this method of magnifying slow motions to the motion of growing seed lings Several peas and beans were placed in a glass root cage containing wet sand The photographs were taken by artificial light at fixed intervals day and night for about three weeks When the film is run through the kinetoscope the entire growth for the period of three weeks is reproduced in a few seconds I found the motions of two peas which were placed upon the top of the soil especially interesting These peas found it almost impossible to get their roots into the soil In one case the root came out of the top of the pea and made directly for the moist soil It found this too hard to penetrate but the root contin ued to grow the result being that the pea was rolled about the root cage in a very grotesque manner the root curving aind writhing much like an angle worm strug gling to get into the soil The kinetoscope also shows very clearly the different speeds at which the various parts of the plant grow and the different speeds at which the same part grows at dif ferent times The greatest variety in the rate of growth exists as I suppose is well known and of course the kinetoscope brings out the relative rates of growth in a very truthful and graphic manner I regret that my first film does not show any consider able part of the growth of the stems of the plant as after growing a few centimeters the stems opened the lid of the root cage and passed out of range of the camera The rather startling results of this method as applied to growing plants has caused me to give some further attention to the matter At the present time I am preparing some APRIL 6 1900N S VOL XI No 275 additional films taken from growing seeds Of course there is no reason why the pho tographing should not be continued until the plants have bloomed and fruited if any fact important to mechanics or botany is likely to result from the trouble Perhaps botanists know of matters in plant growth and plant development that it may pay them to investigate by the same method I anticipate that some interesting facts con cerning the mechanics of the roots motion into and through the soil will result from such studies I have taken up the work now being done upon living organisms as merely pre liminary to the general problem that I have set before me It must be several months before enough material can be accumu lated for a proper discussion of observed and theoretical results in the motions of plastic solids The actual results may prove disappointing but this fact cannot be determined in advance CHAS S SLICETER MARYLANDS HIGHWAY REPORT THERE is a growing realization in this country that the problems which have to be met and solved in the construction of better highways are in large measure geological problems The most satisfactory outcome of this tendency which has yet appeared in this country is the report on highway im provement in Maryland which has been recently issued by the Maryland Geological Survey and the Survey through these in vestigations and this report has rendered the cause of good roads in the country at large an important service The work resulting in this report was au thorized by the General Assembly of Mary land in an Act passed early in April 1898 which provided an appropriation of 10000  Maryland Geological Survey Vol III 1899 pp 461 Highway Improvement Baltimore Md W B Clark State Geologist per annum for the investigation of ques tions of road construction in that State and for the preparation of reports thereon Under this act a highway division was at once established under the supervision of the State Geologist Professor W B Clark and Dr H F Reid was appointed chief of this division Mr A N Johnson Mr St George Lioussat and Mr F H Schloer special assistants It was also arranged that other assistants connected with the different branches of the Survey should co operate in examining the character and dis tribution in the State of the roadbuilding materials Of the volume before us which contains the results of these investigations and which it is hoped may serve as a model for similar work in many other States it is dif ficult to give any thing like an adequate synopsis in the brief space allotted for an ordinary book review In a short in troductory chapter Professor Clark has given a copy of the law under which the work was provided for and a brief state ment as to the purpose and character of the enquiries and investigations carried on dur ing 1898 and 1899 This is followed by a more elaborate chapter by Professor Clark on the Relations of Maryland Topography Climate and Geology to Highway Con struction  a subject which must be thor oughly understood by the highway engineer before he can intelligently plan locate or construct in any section of country either a system of highways or an individual road This chapter includes a brief de scription of the topographical features of the State and its different geographical sub divisions coastal plain Piedmont plateau and the Appalachian region and the influ ence these have had and should have here after on the location of the roads The question of temperature is not so im portant a feature in Maryland as in some of the more northern States for the reason 536 SCIENCE

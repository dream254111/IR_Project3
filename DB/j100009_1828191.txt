j100009,The American Economic Review,1828191,The Definition of Price,i331809,The American Economic Review VOL II DECEMBER 1912 No 4 THE DEFINITION OF PRICE I Scope and plan of study The need of a clearer more consistent and more generally ac cepted terminology in economics is felt by all economists today The selection of price as the first subject for terminological discussion may however call for justification1 It has been ob jected that price is a less difficult term less in need of redefini tion than are various other concepts such as value cost etc But the easiest topic in terminology is none too simple Our defini tions which should constitute a system seem at times to be but a snarl to be untangled if at all only by carefully pulling a strand at a time beginning with the threads least immeshed Price in all its variations of definition has to do with practical transactions in the market it seems to be a more tangible fact a more superficial phenomenon than such things as value and cost it should present therefore fewer difficulties in definition Yet it presents difficulties enough to call for all our patience and thought With the purpose of determining not only what definitions of price have been used but also what if any trend of thought in the subject could be discovered the writer consulted many texts and found some 117 definitions2 These were classified according to the following plan 1 A few of the data in this paper were informally presented by the writer as chairman at the round table discussion on the price concept in relation to value in Washington D C Dec 29 1911 See Proceedings of the American Economic Association AMERICAN EcoNoMIc REVIEW vol II no I supp p 89 2The list of texts consulted includes all the general texts on economics and all the economic cyclopedias found in the Princeton and in the Columbia Univer sity libraries Further labor would doubtless discover a number of other texts and might lead to changes in the classification of some writers but the study has been extended enough to warrant the belief that our most important results would not be materially changed by new data The data are taken as fairly representative though not exhaustively statistical No complete list784 Frank A Fetter December Group A Objectiveexchangevalue3 definitions of price in terms of value in the sense of purchasing power including on grounds of relationship of ideas some definitions in which no men tion of value appears Group B Subjectivevalue3 definitions of price in terms of value in the sense of desirability estimation subjective value including cases in which value is merely said to be reflected in some degree by price or is merely in the background of the thought Group C Ratioofexchange definitions of price in terms of value in the sense of a mere ratio of exchange or bare mathemati cal expression or quantum In these descriptions the phrase in terms of value means as a species of the genus value or as an expression or measure of value see below p 807 In each of these groups are two varieties usually but not always clearly identifiable Variety 1 Nonmonetary definitions of price wherein price is not peculiarly connected with the moneyexpression ie takes form in any commodity or sum of goods given and received in exchange for another thing Variety 2 Monetary definitions of price wherein price is peculiarly connected with the moneyexpression The combination of these two classifications gives six main kinds of definitions hereafter referred to as types eg as type Al the nonmonetary

following would be included List Newman Paoletti and many other of the older Italian writers Pierson Raper Rapet Raymond Rogers Scialjo Walras Wieser Many have just chanced to avoid committing them selves directly or indirectly to a definition of price usually by employing some other phrase such as market value as a synonym The definition that would have been given by some of these writers might be fairly well inferred but I have not done this except in a few cases as indicated in the text of this article At the round table discussion at Washington the distinction tentatively presented by the writer as primary was that of monetary nonmonetary with the subheads A B and C indicating the type of value definition See Proceedings AMERICAx EcoxoMIc REVIEW VOl II No 1 supp P 89 1 The Austrian

with that of Adam Smith returning later to the type which was used by his predecessors and by some of his contemporaries Smith Wealth of Nations 1776 gives no formal definition of price but implies one in these statements I shall endeavor to show    what is the real measure of this exchangeable value or wherein consists the real price of all commodi ties Routledge ed p 22 The real price of everything what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it is the toil and trouble of acquiring it p 22 Labor was the first pricethe original purchase money etc p 28 The exchangeable value of every commodity is more frequently estimated by the quantity of money than    of labor or of any other commodity p 24 Every commodity besides is more frequently exchanged for and therefore compared with other commodities than with labor It is more natural therefore to estimate its changeable value by the quan tity of some other commodity than by that of the labor which it can purchase p 23 Price here means the cost of a thing either in exchange or in direct production and may be measured in other commodities or in toil trouble labor or money Smiths definition is of the nonmonetary

between the value of the goods to be given and the value of those to be received This indicates that the goods on either side of the exchange may be deemed to be the price of the other goods R Malthus Political Economy London 1820 well nigh goes over to a monetary concept believing it would certainly be bet ter but confesses that it is not uncommon to speak of the price of a commodity in labor or in other commodities p 58 A clearcut example of this type of definition occurs in R Tor rens Production of Wealth London 1821 Exchangeable value expresses the power of purchasing with respect to commodities in general    price denotes the same power with respect to some particular commodity the quantity of which is given Examples given are corn or wine or labor or money p 48 Similar definitions were given by the English writers John Mill J R McCulloch and T DeQuincy 1844 and then the non monetary variety of exchangevalue definition disappears from the American writings in our list until 1870 Bowen and from the English until 1874 Cairnes J E Cairnes said Some Leading Principles of Political Econ omy 1874  rCommodities may rise or fall in relation to any selected one among the number and if gold or silver be the one selected commodi ties in general may rise in relation to gold or silver The value of other commodities in relation to a commodity thus selected is called price Outlines prepared by teachers in the University of Chicago1912 The Definition of Price 787 Francis A Walker offers a good example of this type Political Economy 1884 Price is purchasing power expressed in terms of some one article powerinexchangeforthatarticle be the same wheat or beef or wool or gold or silver In common speech the word price brings up the idea of moneyvalue the purchasing power of an article expressed in terms of money Yet it is equally correct to say that the price is 75 bushels of wheat as to say it is 100 p 82 A nonmonetary but near monetary definition is given by Houdard Premiers Principes de lEconomique Paris 1889 Price is the expression of the exchange value of a thing in units of exchange value p 97 The term price has received the meaning of the commodity given as equivalent to another   In most cases    price signifies the quantity of money necessary to acquire a good p 98 The seven last writers in the foregoing list from Devas 1892 on three English two American one French and one German all show evidence of the influence of the newer marginal utility doctrine combined with otherwise conservative views on economic theory Pesch the one German writer 1905 is a Jesuit priest whose ideas evidently are taken directly from Devas professor in the University of Dublin and not from German sources III Objectiveexchangevalue monetary definitions type A2 The curious wording exchangeable value expresses the power of purchasing which occurs in Torrens definition above im plies some confusion between ideas of value as a quality of things and as the concrete object in which it is expressed Already this confusion had appeared in the identifying of purchasing power and price in Ricardos Political Economy in 1817 four years be fore Torrens book Ricardo at the same time gave the first ex ample to be found in our list of the monetary variety of the price concept He gave in that connection no formal definition of price nor did he explicitly distinguish it from value5 He quotes Adam Smith approvingly however as to labor being the real price and the first price He speaks of the natural price of wages estimated in food and necessaries6 These expressions by them selves imply the nonmonetary concept of price but he heads section 7 of chapter 1 Different effects from the alteration in the value of money the medium in which price is

grants a wider nonmonetary meaning in a state of barter Carver says that the commodity in which price is expressed is usually called money perhaps admitting a nonmonetary meaning1912 The Definition of Price 789 Exchange value requires to be distinguished from Price The words Value and Price were used as synonyms by the early political econo mists and are not always discriminated even by Ricardo But the most accurate modern writers to avoid the wasteful expenditure of two good scientific terms on a single idea have employed price to ex press the value of a thing in relation to money the quantity of money for which it will exchange By the price of a thing therefore we shall henceforth understand its value in money by the value or ex change value of a thing its general power of purchasing the command which its possession gives over purchasable commodities in general Political Economy Book X ch 1 sec 2 p 538 Mill has no glimpse here of the preRicardian ground of dis tinction between exchangeable value as a quality or power in commodities and price as the expression of that power in terms of commodities10 Thinking therefore that the two words were used as synonyms even by Ricardo he fixes upon the monetary expression of price as a possible distinguishing character Yet he does not define price as the money or amount of money given in exchange but as the value purchasing power expressed in terms of money This distinction may not be immediately ob vious but it involves a real problem in terminology Mill leaves no special name either for the amount of money itself or for the quantity of commodities in general given in exchange for a thing The definition of P LeroyBeaulieu stresses the estimation of value rather than its expression Precis dEcon Pol 1st ed 1887 When value is estimated in money it takes the name price p 208 The mathematician S Newcomb emphasizes price as a measure of value in preference to the terms expression or estimation in a definition of a monetary type Principles 1885 Price is considered as the measure of value The price of a com modity is the number of units of money which the commodity can be exchanged for in the public market    Price is the measure of value just as length is the measure of a line p 63 In the French dictionary of Coquelin et Guillaumin Dict de lEcon Pol 1854 all reference to value is omitted and a mere amountofmoney definition is given Price is the quantity of money for which one may buy or sell a commodity p 435 Similar definitions are given by J L Laughlin Political Econ omy 1888 Price is the amount of money for which an arti cle may be exchanged by Macvane 1890 The price of a thing 0An explanation of this oversight is given below pp 801802790 Frank A Fetter December means the amount of money it exchanges for by A de Foville in Says Dict 1896 Price is the sum for which it is or can be exchanged and by Beauregard Elements 1905 Price oc curs when a thing is exchanged for money This form of con crete definition of price without explicit reference to value rare among those whose value concept is objective is found more fre quently among those who hold a subjective concept as is indi cated below p 808 IV Subjectivevalue nonmonetary definitions type Bi The list of definitions in group B begins with Beccaria work written between 1769 and 1771 but first published in 1804 There are 28 examples of

following are a few representative definitions of this type C Beccaria in Scrittori Classici Italiani vol 18 p 339 said The quantity of anything which must be given for an other fixes and is called its price In the succeeding pages dis cussing value and price money is not mentioned and wine is called the price of the grain for which it is given and vice versa He appears in these pages to use value always in the sense of the estimation of a thing whereas price is the object given J B Say in Political Economy 1st ed 1803 citations from the 3d American ed 11 Approximate date of earliest edition undated of his Grundriss 6th ed 1907 used by many American students 2Published in French at Lausanne1912 The Definition of Price 791 The valuation of an object is nothing more or less than the affirma tion that it is in a certain degree of comparative estimation with some other specified object and any other object possessed of value may serve as the point of comparison p 235 The only fair criterion of the value of an object is the quantity of other commodities at large that can be readily obtained for it in exchange whenever the owner wishes to part with it and this in all commercial dealings and in all money valuations is called the cur rent price p 236 The price of an article is the quantity of money it may be worth current price the quantity it may be sure of obtaining at the par ticular place    moneyprice is selected for the purpose of illustration in preference to price in commodities at large merely for greater simplicity but the real and ultimate object of exchange is not money but commodities p 25013 K Menger in Grundsdtze 1871 Prices or in other words the quantities of goods appearing in exchange p 172 A Wagner in Grundlegung 1st ed 1876 ref to 3d ed 1892 The price of a good is the quantity of other goods for which it actually is exchanged    a good can have as many prices as there are goods for which it is exchanged    the money price is only one priceform the most usual    The concept of price is to be formed so generally that every equivalent in exchange whether money or something else can be brought under it p 339 A T Hadley in Economics 1896 A price in the broadest sense of the word is the quantity of one thing which is exchanged for another p 70 A price in the com mercial sense of the word may be defined as the quantity of money for which the right to an article or a service is exchanged p 72 F C Hicks in Lectures on the Theory of Economics 1901 Value when measured is expressed in terms of the measure or unit of comparison and this expression is price Price then may be de fined as value expressed in terms of a measure p 29 The price for the horse is 50 sheep This is the value of the horse expressed in terms of the measure sheep p 33 S N Patten The Theory of Prosperity 1902 p 17 Price is the quantity of one article which must be given in ex 18 These latter statements are taken to justify our classification of Says definition However in his notes to Storch Cours dEcon Pol 1823 he says It is preferable usage to call exchangeable value the quantity of all other goods that are given in exchange for what one wishes to have and price the quantity of money that is given for the same object vol 1 p 72 This would indicate that perhaps through Ricardian influence Say had gone over to a monetary exchange value concept of price792 Frank A Fetter December change for another    The price of a loaf of bread is the quantity of meat sugar or other articles for which it exchanges E R A Seligman in Principles of Economics 1905 gives two definitions on the same page When we measure a commodity in terms of some one other com modity we speak of price If the value of a cow is equal to that of five sheep we say that the price of a cow is five sheep    by price we now mean the money value of anythingthe amount of money for which it will exchange p 184 V Subjectivevalue monAetary definitions type B2 Of this type we

time is that of Jevons we shall in discussing Group C reverse the order followed heretofore and begin with the monetary type Three examples of this have been found Jevons  1871 E Rambaud  1895 F Davenport    1908 A As students of Jevons will recall he was not a courageous terminologist and was prone to abandon an ambiguous term in stead of clarifying it He did this in the case of value and even thought of rejecting the term money because it had no universally accepted meaning He declares in favor of substituting for value the term ratio of exchange He could do this without fully realizing the havoc this suggestion if adopted generally would make for he was an ultraBenthamite in his psychology and had therefore transferred most of the content of the term value to the term utility as noted below p 802 Of value he says Now if there is any fact certain about value it is that it means not an object at all but a quality attribute or rather a circumstance of an object Value implies in fact a relation but if so it cannot possibly be some other thing Theory of Political Economy 1871 pp 8182 The same commodities in the same market can have only one ratio of exchange which must therefore prevail between each body and each other idem p 118 Jevons nowhere so far as I can find formally defined price and the classification of him here is based on his use of the word in a few cases where it seems to mean a ratio of exchange expressed in money His attention seemed directed upon the idea of a ratio implicit in the quantity of goods exchanged rather than upon the quantity of goods and he did not speak of price as the other ob ject given in exchange The initial influence of Jevons in this group of six definitions warrants some further examination of his conception Save only Gunton where the connection however seems probable the other five cases of ratio definitions are traceable in phrase and argument to Jevons794 Frank A Fetter December Jevons was very laudably seeking for a more scientific treat ment of the fundamental principles through the application of mathematics to economics He was however with his great gen eral ability but a crude psychologist judged by present standards and as he confessed himself not a very profound mathematician When he says see above that value means not an object at all but a quality etc he doubtless had in mind the loose state ment not infrequently made before his time and since that in the case of two commodities each is the value ie purchasing power of the other for examples see below p 807 No says Jevons very justly value is a quality attribute or rather a circumstance of an object So far this seems to be a more cor rect psychological analysis than that made by Jevons contempor aries He then adds value implies our italics in fact a rela tion but if so it cannot possibly be some other thing This he seems to think is a proof that value is a relation and he there upon defines value as a ratio of exchange But to say that a quality implies a relation is not the same as saying that it is a relation or ratio in the mathematical sense Height and weight are qualities of objects and each implies some relation to these commensurable qualities in other objects but neither the relation per se whatever that might be nor its mathematical expression in units of other commensurable concrete goods can properly be called the quality itself No more with the exchange value of which Jevons was speaking Now each of these writers in the small group C who has been lured by the hope of finding through mathematics a more scientific treatment of price has made this shift The hope is not only to dematerialize purchasing power by making it mean no longer the other thing but to despiritualize it also so that it remains noth ing but a cold mathematical expression All qualities cease to be except in the mathematical aspect The concept of the quality value becomes merely a mathematical expression The first clear evidence of Jevons influence upon another authors definition appears twentyfive years later Rambaud Elements etc Paris 1895 while seeming not quite to catch the nature of Jevons dissent from the conventiorral view repeats his language and makes still more explicit the definition of price as the monetary expression of a ratio of exchange ie of value as he used it but adds nothing to the argument1912 The Definition of Price 795 Value viewed in the latter aspect objective is what Jevons calls ratio of exchange    Whenever this ratio of exchange is expressed in units of money as is customary in all society however little civilized it takes the name of price p 256 The only other author in our list who expresses adherence to the monetary ratioconcept of price is H J Davenport in his Value and Distribution 1908 He questions whether Money may be regarded as a measure of value p 181 Market price fails in the requirement fundamental to the notion of measure ment namely that a measure must be quantitative and must measure things of quantity But market value is neither a magnitude nor a quantity but only a ratio p 184 The authors thought is here of value in the older objective sense though in general he gives a psychological treatment of value In another passage occurring later he faces the problem of terminology directly In German usage Preis is the generic term for the good on either side of an exchange in its function of quid pro quo If the exchange relation is one of good against the money good the money is called the Geldpreis In English usageas goes without sayingprice has been limited to mean exchange power expressed in terms of money solely15 Thus while on the whole the German usage may well ap pear to be the more philosophical it must remain true that popularly price means the money that a thing will sell for and that some term for this money relation this expression of exchange power in terms of a conventionally specialized money commodity is imperatively called for pp 218219 A few things are worthy of comment here the first is the authors impression as to the uniformity of English usage According to our count of 61 English and American writers 26 give non monetary and 35 monetary definitions16 The second is the authors suggestion that what he has seen fit to call the German usage may well appear to be the more philosophical For what can that mean other than the more I A similar but modified impression possibly influenced by Davenports statement is that of B M Anderson Social Value 1911 p 175 In most English treatises on economics    price as a rule involves the idea of money But Anderson himself uses price with the wider nonmonetary meaning Details are as follows Nonmonetary twelve English and five American writers total seventeen in the A group one English and six American total seven in the B group and two American in the C group Monetary eleven English and fifteen American in the A group no English and seven American in the B group and one English and one American in the C group796 Frank A Fetter December scientific In matters of science a very strong presumption must hold against the less philosophical definition The third is the authors implication that if the definition is not limited that is exclusively to the monetary expression our language is left without any term for this money relation On this see further below17 VII Ratioofexchange nonmonetary definitions type Cl We turn now to three examples in group C of the nonmonetary type Ippoliti  1898 I Gunton  1900 A Fisher I  1908 A Barone Francesco dIppoliti professor of economics in Naples Corso dEcon Sociale Naples 1893 somewhat eclectically says in words again recalling Jevons but suggesting some influence from the marginal utility doctrine The relation between a useful thing and that which serves as its measure is called the price which relation is one of value equal to another value If the thing serving as a measure is money then price will be the value expressed in money p 79 Value is a rela tion of equivalence between two economic quantities It is a ratio an equation p 74 G Gunton gives the following definition a curious composite of older and newer ideas Outlines of Social Economics 1900 Value and price are identical Value and price are two names for the same thing Both mean simply the ratio in which commodities in cluding money are exchanged for each other or for human service    J S Mills distinction is confusing and unnecessary  In modern society where money is used value and price are the same thing p 62 Because of the plain statement of price as a ratio this definition must be classed with group C but it has only a superficial re lationship with the other five definitions The other five ratio definitions might be likened to seedling varieties of the subjective 17 P 812 Davenports expressions on the subject of price occur somewhat incidentally in the discussion of other subjects and should not be taken as his final judgment It may be allowable to quote from a letter of recent date in which Davenport referring to certain critical work says with char acteristic openmindedness It convinces me    that there is a serious issue to be fought out as to the significance of the word price and its relation to value Earlier he had expressed doubt as to the advantage of discussing the definition of price1912 The Definition of Price 797 value doctrine this is a branch from one of the seedlings grafted upon the old exchange value stock In Irving Fisher appears a writer with thorough mathematical training and at the same time with a very favorable attitude toward the subjectivevalue doctrine In matters of definition however the mathematical interest leads Fisher to the extremest possible limit and plays havoc with the psychological concept of value as appears in the text and later in the glossary of definitions Nature of Capital and Income 1906 If either of the two quantities of wealth is divided by the other the quotient is called the price of the latter    In modern times one of the two articles is usually money but this condition is not essential and in primitive times was not even common p 11 Pricea ratio of exchange p 885 Money priceThe quotient found by dividing the money exchanged for goods by the quantity of the goods themselves p 335 The value of goods wealth property services is the product of their quantity multiplied by their price p 336 It will be observed that Fisher defines not value as did Jevons but price as a ratio of exchange and shifts the word value over to a significance quite as unlike Jevons concept as it is unlike that of the orthodox or that of the Austrian school Though he does not go back quite as far as does Gunton to the old identification of value and price he leaves only a mathematical nonqualitative distinction between them Another of the several remarkable things about these defini tions of value and of price is the authors conscious disregard of all economic authority Fisher does not and evidently knows that he cannot cite a single precedent in economic literature in support of his novel suggestion But his appeal is to business usage as he interprets it to be His statement is as follows The definition of value which has been given applying as it does to an aggregate of wealth instead of the unit departs somewhat from economic usage but it follows closely the usage of business men and practical statisticians Economists have not usually thought it neces sary to distinguish between the purchasing power of the unit and the aggregate but have employed the term value indiscriminately to both    It seems preferable to conform our definitions of value and price as closely as possible to business usage which instinctively and consistently applies the term price to the unit and value to the aggregate p 18 Fisher here is comparing his concept of value with that of the798 Frank A Fetter December RicardianMill school purchasingpower and not with the sub jective concept He says pp 1415 Value as here explained is not a subjective magnitude in the mind of man but purely objective as moneyvalue wheatvalue It has of course subjective causes but these do not concern us yet It is apart from our main purpose to criticise in detail at this point this unique concept of value This however may be said that value is here turned to a use already filled Any unit either of price or of quantity of goods is arbitrary and must be always indicated either expressly or by implication whenever a price is stated as price in cents ounces of bullion per bushel wagonload ton of grain cotton iron etc Conversely the term aggregate is an arbitrary one and may be deemed a unit if one please Thus a bushel of wheat is but an aggregate of grains of wheat Consequently the word price can be used without confusion either for the conventional unit or the aggregate of units and nothing is gained by the innovation On the other hand the loss to terminology is great when the term value is taken from its subjective use in which it is indispensable for thereby an under standing of the recent valuediscussion is made hopeless A demon stration of this is already at hand Both this unit idea and this definition of price have been employed by A A Young Quarterly Journal of Economics vol XXV pp 409428 May 1911 with no hint that they lack the sanction of long and general usage His criticism of the recent psychological treatment is made on the assumption that he is using value in the same sense as do the authors he is criticising This particular distinction has been sanctioned not with en tire consistency by Landry Manuel dEconomique Paris 1908 whose concept of value is however that of purchasing power and whose definition is classified here as of the nonmonetary exchange value type Al It would be preferable  to signify by price the value of a unit of a certain sort of goods men do not speak of the price of a stock of goods    but of their value pp 492498 VIII Historical survey before Adam Smith Let us now essay to see these details in some perspective and if possible to find in what may at first appear to be but a succes sion of personal and arbitrary opinions some trend and explana tion Let us begin with a glance at the tendencies of thought before1912 The Definition of Price 799 the end of the eighteenth century The Latin pretium bequeathed some ambiguity to its derivative price Pretium seems to have meant either a subjective or an objective fact that is sometimes an estimation or appreciation and again a thing or sum of things given in exchange18 This variety of meanings appears in Italian still in the eigh teenth century whether with historical continuity is not clear The word prezzo appears to be used interchangeably with valore in the meaning of estimation in many places not always in the writings contained in the Scrittori Classici Italiani In German only the meaning of the thing given is now ex pressed by Preis and Neumann expressly warns against the am biguity come down from the older usage the beliebte Identifici rung von Preis und Pretiuml that is the use of verum rei pretium price in the sense of vera rei aestimatio Wert20 The psycho logical implication of pretium still appears in the English words appreciate depreciate and their derivatives The mediaeval term justum pretium was used it would seem in the sense of a correct or right sum to be given in exchange measured by some moral standard more or less vaguely in mind the true worth perhaps sometimes the true and abiding benefit Mere prettium however not jus turn when used in an objective sense seems to have meant whatever was given in exchange for a thing and it was a just price only when it coincided in amount with that called for or warranted by a moral estimate It would seem that as the problem of price began in the minds of men to be less an ethical and more a commercial one the con cept of just price was first displaced by that of subjective value as a standard with which actual prices were compared The standard became the intensity of desire of bidders in a market This change appears in all of the European languages In Ital ian the change seems to have been comparatively late yet in the eighteenth century in some Italian writings prezzo the thing given had come to be contrasted with valore used in the now current subjective sense of the estimation or better of the quality 1 Dr H Sewall The Theory of Value before Adam Smith in Publications of the American Economic Association 3d series vol II pp 5424 Dr Sewall thinks that the Romans had an idea of price as value in exchange but a very vague one 19 F J Neumann in Schonbergs HIandbuch 1st ed 188S vol I p 174  Idem note and p 171800 Frank A Fetter December esteemed Thus our three preSmithian examples Beccaria Verri and Condillac reflect the best usage of their time in Italian and French by which price and value were contrasted as objective and subjective as thing given and quality for which given as concrete object and as the intangible thing esteem IX Historical survey objectiveexchangevalue definitions Adam Smith more than his contemporaries approached the question of price with a distinctively commercial interest to ex plain the cause of prices in a developed market Price apparently was understood as the object or service or group of objects given in exchange Smith attempted an analysis of the com ponent parts of price and without any special thought of termin ology he connected price with a concept of value as purchasing power rather than as subjective his usevalue Price he said is the real measure of this exchangeable value The thing given in exchange being the measure of the purchasing power was looked upon as nearly the same as the purchasing power Smith thus heads our list of objectivevalue definitions which comprise 61 per cent of our collection Smiths definition was of the nonmonetary variety as are all ten of the definitions dating earlier than 1817 It is in Ricardo that we have found the first clear example of the monetary kind Even he as we have seen above p 787 at first followed Smiths lead then later definitively turned in another direction and made price mean the monetary expression of exchangevalue Just then the fortunes of the monetary and the objectivevalue concept became intertwined in a large measure not merely it would seem because of the potent example of Ricardos usage but because that example but spoke the logic of the situation When one under stands by value a personal estimate or more exactly a quality in goods esteemed by a person one sees much significance in the contrast of this value with the object given or received for it But when one gives only the objective meaning purchasing power to value and then not being interested in subtle distinctions comes to identify that purchasing power with the thing that can be gotten in exchange for it value and price have become synony mous and remain so until some other distinction can be suggested At a time when the barter economy was everywhere in Eng land being replaced more and more by the money economy1912 The Definition of Price 801 Ricardo as a man of the City knew no prices excepting those expressed as money and in the contrast between value as purchas ing power in general and money as the particular form expres sion or measure he easily saw a new ground of distinction Thence arose a new variety of pricedefinition2 The trend of opinion in this direction became at once marked Of our 14 examples dating from 1817 to 1847 8 are of the mone tary variety and but 6 are nonmonetary 13 are of the objec tivevalue group and but one a German is of the subjective value group Then in 1848 J S Mill in so many ways the fulfillment of Ricardo clearly expressed his opinion as preceding obj ective alue theorists had implied theirs that the only distinction to be found between value as he used it and price was in the mone tary character of the price expression Between 1848 and 1870 outside of German lands Mills choice swept nearly all before it Everyone of the 12 nonGerman writers of that period in our list formulates his definition of price in connection with an ob jectivevalue concept A group and 11 of these are of the mone tary variety Bowen the American being the exception 1870 Of the 7 German writers 3 Roscher Umpfenbach and Man goldt recognize the subjective concept of value but formulate nonmonetary price definitions Al in connection with the ob jectivevalue concept 2 Schulze and Glaser formulate non monetary subjectivevalue concepts B1 and 2 Stein and Maurus formulate monetary subjectivevalue concepts B2 It may seem remarkable that so important a term as value could undergo the transfer or transformation of meaning above traced without leaving a noticeable gap in terminology The explanation is hardly doubtful and is not without interest In its verbal use the word value underwent hardly any corresponding change and still signified in popular and scientific speech to esteem to attach importance etc But in its substantive use the word value was In the Washington discussion Professor S N Patten pointed out that the character of the change from a barter to a moneyeconomy was so strik ing in Ricardos time that it would easily suggest new categories and the shifting of terms See Proceedings AMERICAN EcoNoMIc REVIEW vol 11 No 1 supp p 91 It seems most probable that eighteenth century writers had used the word price in this way but Ricardo is the first clearcut ex ample our study has as yet revealed of the formal limitation of price to monetary terms802 Frcank A Fetter December from near the end of the eighteenth century rapidly losing at least in economic writings all trace of the psychological quality of exciting desire and was coming to mean purchasingpower powerinexchange objective At the same time the place of Adam Smiths mongrel phrase usevalue was largely through the authority of Bentham being taken by the word utility In turn the word utility in philosophical and economic discussion was shorn in large part of its earlier and fundamental meaning of benefit independent of desire The full account of this change would be too long a story at this place but this it was I venture to suggest that made it possible for Mill and others to quite miss the significance of the earlier distinction between value and price This it was too which introduced into economic discussion new ambiguities and misunderstandings which still in the concept of marginal utility persist to plague even the revivified form of the subjectivevalue doctrine whether it comes through Gossen or Jevons or Menger or Clark or any other This change of terminology in English seems to have been only very incompletely made in German where the root words Wert and Nutzen were not easy to confuse Group A includes nearly all of the economists that can be classi fied ap of the SmithRicardoMill school Altogether 60 per cent of our examples are of this group 23 per cent nonmonetary and 37 per cent monetary The nonmonetary line begins with Smith and ends with the University of Chicago teachers and the mone tary line begins with Ricardo and ends with Taussig Only a few are here who are not of the fairly strict orthodox school of theory if by that be understood the adherents to the doctrines of the exceptional nature of the law of rent of the producedgoods concept of capital of the costofproduction theory of value etc Among these exceptions may be noted Carey and his disciple E P Smith There are some writers however who have a strong leaning toward a more psychological concept of value and by affinity might be expected to adhere to the B group but by habit of thought or force of precedent have so expressed themselves that they must be classified in the A group Such in the period before 1870 appear to be Hufeland Roscher Umpfenbach and Man goldt Such after 1870 are Devas 1892 Cannan 1897 and Lindsay in Palgraves Dictionary 1899 It may be noted also that all of these seven favor the nonmonetary type of definition1912 The Definition of Price 803 and the three later ones all evidence the influence of the subjective value discussion Thus in the year 1870 the MillRicardian economics was outside of German lands thoroughly in possession of ihe field In Ger many also it exercised a powerful influence even in terminology which crosses a Sprachgrenze with difficulty For sixtyfive years from 1805 to 1870 the objectivevalue group of price definitions had a monopoly so far as we have found among English Ameri can French and Italian writers while claiming also 5 of the 11 German writers X Historical survey subjectivevalue definitions With the year 1871 which saw the publication of the notable theoretical works of Menger and of Jevons came a new impulse To Mengers influence can be directly traced most of the defi nitions of group B in our list between 1871 and 1911 to the influence of Jevons is probably due the distinctive mark of all the definitions in group C and the influence of Jevons combined to strengthen the Austrians appeal for a psychological concept of value however much his terminology differed from theirs To these influences contributed likewise the awakened interest of American students in German scholarship Such traces of Ger man economic thought as have reached England in the past forty years seem to have filtered through the medium of American writ ings as was genially and wittily expressed by Mr Henry Higgs a representative of the British Economic Society at the anni versary meeting of the American Economic Association in 1909 Though the writings of Wieser and B6hmBawerk owed their trans lation into English to the Scotch economist Smart they have seemed to make little impression upon British economists while deeply affecting American thought The nonmonetary Bi type of price definition is most char acteristic of the more thoroughgoing subj ectivevalue theorists First in the list is a little group of two Italian names and one French Beccaria Verri and Condillac not to be taken merely as three independent opinions but representative of the prevailing conceptions before the SmithRicardian era Then in 1803 and 1804 Say and Lauderdale akin in their doctrines on a number of points including their sympathy with a subjective treatment of value Then from 1805 to 1870 only three examples of the non monetary subjectivevalue conceptall German Then with Men804 Frank A Fetter December gers notable restatement of the psychological doctrine appear between 1871 and 1911 twenty examples including his own of the nonmonetary type of price definition BI besides ten of the B2 type Mengers influence was not because of his own brief verbal definition of price but rather because of his revitalizing of the treatment of the fundamentals in economic theory The monetary variety of the subjectivevalue group B2 of which there are thirteen examples appears to have been produced by a process of hybridizing All price definitions before 1845 were either of the nonmonetary subjectivevalue type BI or of one of the two objectivevalue types A The first three cases of B2 occurred between 1845 and 1858 and were all German This sug gests that the writers with a subjectivevalue concept most con genial to German thought framed their definition of price by grafting upon it the monetary idea then become general in English economics The cases of Schmoller Kemmerer and A S John son are recent examples of the same tendency All of the eight writers from Gide in 1883 on except Schmoller have been largely influenced by the Austrian psychological treatment of value Gide Andrews and Ely being pioneers in their countries in this process of transplantation At least six of the eight however retain strong evidences of a continuing Ricardian influence This group thus consists of writers who while using words in defining price very similar to those used eg by J S Mill have a very different psychological basis They think of the value which is expressed as subjective not as purchasing power and they must reject the reason assigned by J S Mill for adopting a monetary definition The place of Group C in the order of development has been made sufficiently evident in our preceding criticism of it Jevons well meant effort as students of economics know was only accidentally terminological and was primarily to find a sounder psychological explanation of price than that in the then current costofproduc tion doctrine The inspirational results of Jevons work in this field are considerable but his suggestion of a mathematical ratio ofexchange concept seems to have been a turn into a blind lane Jevons has found for his ratio concept of value and price not a single disciple among his own compatriots The one French one Italian and three American writers who reflect his influence show individual variety and freshness of thought but no evidence1912 The Definition of Price 805 of a price concept capable of further development If freed from its initial confusion this idea of Jevons would probably lose its distinctive significance and thereby these six definitions of price C group become classifiable with the other two groups XI Statistical survey and some critical comments We may be helped to see the general trend by taking the statisti cal results of our study without placing too much emphasis on an enumeration necessarily incomplete In the period before 1817 the A group shows 40 per cent of all definitions between 1817 and 1847 93 per cent all but the one German in 18481870 79 per cent the fall being due entirely to the larger proportion of German names in our list in this period  in 18711911 51 per cent the fall being due to the re naissance of the subjective concept everywhere but in England Conversely the B definitions constitute before 1817 60 per cent of all fall to 7 per cent between 1817 and 1847 and increase to 40 per cent in the period between 18711911 the remaining 9 per cent being of the C group The correlation between the monetary and the objective value concepts since Ricardos time appears in these figures none of the A definitions were monetary before 1817 18171847 54 per cent of them were monetary 18481870 73 per cent this falling to 66 per cent between 18711911 was because of the conflicting influences of this period as already described The B group was 100 per cent nonmonetary until after 1848 between 18481870 but one B definition appears that being monetary and between 18711911 was 66 per cent nonmonetary the fall being mostly due to the acceptance of the subjectivevalue concept by writers who in the main were otherwise Ricardian The C group which dates from 1871 on is 50 per cent of each variety Thus in the past forty years while the A and B definitions appear in almost equal numbers two thirds of the former are monetary and two thirds of the latter are nonmonetary If all definitions be considered there were 100 per cent nonmonetary before Ricardo this figure falling between 1817 and 1847 to 43 per cent and after Mill and until 1870 to 32 per cent and recov ering between 18711911 to 49 per cent In all this history of pricedefinition there is evident an astound806 Frank A Fetter December ing lack hitherto of any systematic study of the problem The few conscious attempts at reformulation occur incidental to the discussion of other problems in which the writers interest is absorbed Doubtless some have given to their choice more of deliberation than is evident but scarcely more than a half dozen seem to have considered the issues at all either in their historical or in their logical bearings Most of the definitions give evidence of a choice made by chance by imitation or by deference to authority Those writers who depart somewhat from precedent seem in most cases to do so with entire naivete without a hint that their unusual definitions are anything but the universal one Amid such diversity of counsels who dare decide Terminology is so essentially a matter for socialized decision in which the individual judgment is not conclusive in the end conclusive only is the general consensus of opinion of scholars as to the expediency in the choice of an aim and of the means of attaining it as to the best usages and analogies of speech and as to the logical con sistency of the definition itself in its parts and in its relations to a system of concepts We have not the space here to restate further the general principles of terminology This has been often and well done already We shall however bear in mind those principles which may be assumed to be accepted The present writer confesses that these laborious researches have compelled a change in his own convictionif the superficial consideration with which a pricedefinition has usually been chosen can be said to lead to a conviction worthy of the name He finds that the problem itself does not seem to be inherently so difficult He finds that it has been needlessly complicated with other questions and he ventures to present some positive opinions in the hope that they may be found to contain a satisfactory solu tion of the problem XII Definition without reference to valte Our first proposal looking toward a universal pricedefinition is that it should be formed without reference to the valueconcept22 Value it will readily be agreed is a more ambiguous and 22This was advocated by A A Young and B M Anderson at the Wash ington discussion from standpoints differing as much from each other as from that of this paper This illustrates the possibility of agreement on this proposal See Proceedings p 91 in the AMERICAN ECOWONncI REVIEW March 1912 supp1912 The Definition of Price 807 more subtle term than price Yet a large proportion of the price definitions are framed in terms of value Good definition should proceed from the known to the unknown from the simple to the complex but most pricedefinitions reverse this order23 It is however possible even for the writers of the A2 group to frame a definition without explicit reference to value e g Coquelin et Guillaumin Laughlin De Foville and Beauregard see above pp 789790 It might with some show of reason be suggested that logically viewed these writers should be classified in a new group for there is an essential distinction between a definition of price as the money or quantity of money itself I In the AX definitions the money price is said to be the value of a com modity exchanged for money by CourcelleSeneuil J S Mill E to measure the value MetzNoblat Newcomb Seager Colson to be value estimated Marcet Vethake LeroyBeaulieu Prothero to express value Ricardo Droz Garnier Boccardo E Cherbuliez Hearn E Batbie A Walker Cossa Cauwes Carey Nazzani E Ford Marshall E Perin Bullock Nicholson Carver Levasseur J F Johnson E to be the notation of value E P Smith or value is said to be price when in terms of money Carey Bonar Taussig E But in many of the definitions of the A2 type the value is spoken of as the quantity of other goods in general given in exchange for the particular good and with this is contrasted price the quantity of money as a species of value eg Senior Vethake in addition to the other expression above noted Mill E Boccardo E Hearn E Nazzani E Macvane Marshall E J F Johnson E Taussig E The writers marked E are equivocal in that they say both that value or sometimes it is price is the quantity of commodities or of money and that the commodities or the money express value A very similar range of expression occurs with writers of the Al type Price is said to measure value A Smith also value to be estimated by the quantity McCulloch Musgrave Pesch E Landry to express Jakob Roscher Mangoldt F A Walker Houdard Molinari Devas Pesch E ltniversity of Chicago to denote Torrens to be a compared exchangeable value Hufeland to be value ratified or made effectual DeQuincy to be value in relation to a selected commodity Cairnes to be realized exchange value Umpfenbach or is spoken of as the same as value price or ex changeable value Ganilh McVickar By others value is spoken of as the quantity of goods which exchanges for another good again it is price which is spoken of in this manner the usage which J S Mill sought to avoid a clear case is presented by his father J Mill  Cannan whose statement is The xalue of a commodity is always the quantity of some other commodity Pesch equivocal though he distinguishes between this sense of price in the concrete and the other in the abstract Gide whose valuedefinition is subjective gives a flagrant example of the identifying of price and value see above p 792808 Frank A Fetter December and as the purchasing power whether that be an abstract quality or another concrete good which the money merely expresses Our reason for not making a separate group of these was doubt whether these writers had any conscious purpose of departing from the conventional conception held by other writers of the same doctrinal trend in nearly all respects A juster interpreta tion seems to be that this omission was merely accidental and that the complete expression of the thought of the writers would contain a reference to value after the manner of the following examples J F Johnson 1905 Price is the amount of money a given commodity will exchange for It expresses therefore the value of a commodity with respect to money p 9 F W Taussig 1911 By the price of a commodity is signified the amount of money which it will command in other words its value in terms of the accepted medium of exchange vol II p 117 The first part of each of these two statements is a definition of price in concrete terms and in this respect conforms to the desideratum we have suggested The second part of Johnsons statement may be taken as his opinion regarding the relations of price to value which one may reject while approving his price definition the second part of Taussigs statement is his alterna tive definition which however might be rejected by one accepting the first part When we turn to the group of subj ectivevalue writers the definition of price in concrete terms is much more frequent indeed it comprises about one half of all the B group nearly three fourths of those of the nonmonetary type A few have been tempted to involve the reference to subjective value with the terms of the price definition among whom are Schaffle Hicks Kleinwiichter Devine Seligman A S Johnson and the present writer In these cases however presumably the statement if completed would have taken the form given it by Kleinwiichter who after defining price as the expression of exchange value24 Lehrbuch der National Oekonomie 1902 p 292 adds that to this an amendment must be made for each of the two exchangers must deem the thing acquired more valuable than the thing given No one holding consistently the subjective concept of value can 24 Kleinwaichter says exchangevalue but the context seems to justify the interpretation that it is the subjective valuation of the two parties to which he refers he has therefore been classified with the B group1912 The Deflnition of Price 809 frame a definition of price as a species of the genus value for price as a concrete object must be contrasted either expressly or impliedly with a psychological estimate which only more or less roughly is reflected in the quantity and kind of that object It should be easy to gain agreement to the proposition that a definition of price should not involve a theory of price and of its relations to value it should be as far as possible objective and be expressed in terms of concrete experience This as our exam ples show can be done without sacrifice of essential views and with gain in clearness by writers of all shades of opinion on valuedoctrine and valueterminology Let each whatever be his opinions as to the component parts of price Adam Smiths prob lem or as to the way in which it and value are connected the Austrian problem withhold that opinion from his definition of price Let us frame a definition of price in terms of the thing given in exchange one of the most familiar the most concrete and the most simple facts in modern mans economic experience Something should be said here of still another modification of the price concept by broadening it so as to include two species per sonal prices and social prices Some variety of this terminology has doubtless been employed pretty widely by teachers since the Austrian doctrine came into vogue but it has rarely found its way into print We have found but two clearcut examples of it the one by A S Johnson above quoted There are personal and social prices just as there are personal and social values    Social price is called market price The other example is by Kemmerer Money and Credit Instru ments etc 1st ed 1906 2d ed 1909 p 4 Every commodity has a subjective price to the individual wanting it In a money economy this price is the individuals subjective valu ation of the commodity in terms of his subj ective valuation of the money unit S for example offers his horse to B for 200 This price is purely subjective and does not of itself lead to an exchange nor make any demand upon the circulating medium A few lines further the author quotes with approval a passage from B6hmBawerk in which he speaks of subjective valuations as the sole cause to which the formation of price is traceable The impression given is that this subjective price vs market price terminology is in accord with the Austrians usage but this is surely not the case25 Throughout BohmBawerks treatment 25A casual examination of Wiesers use of price Natural Value pp 39810 Frank A Fetter December there is a pretty clear threefold distinction maintained among subjective valuations the original is Wertschiitzungen and price the object or goods given and Wert the quality esteemed Kem merer follows a very general usage by identifying valuation and value for he says note p 4 The words subjective value and its derivative subjective valuation as used throughout this paper refer to the quality or property of a commodity of conditioning the gratification of want This use leaves a need in English terminology which he fills with the term subjectiveprice attaching to it the monetary char acter but subjective price is nothing other than individual valuation or Wertschiitzung This may be expressed either in money or in any other good26 66 might leave the impression that he held a price concept of the kind be fore us First as to the monetary mark for all his specific references to price are in monetary terms In introducing his discussion p 39 Wieser expressly limits his inquiry It is not our task here to deal either with price or with the forms of value depending on it A few lines further after indicating his main purpose he says For this purpose it will be sufficient to describe that particular case of the formation of price in which its peculiar principle can be most clearly discerned This is at the same time the normal formation of price uinder the organized division of labor Another expression of Wiesers seems to come near to the phrase subjective price In the table of contents the translator puts it Price Its connection with subjective use value Taking its normal formation we find buyers com ing to market with a maximum price in their minds to which sellers try to drive them I have not the German original and such subtle differences as the one before us are often lost in the translation The text does not quite bear out this wording It says p 40 A person    will not however strong his desire agree to pay any price that may be asked There is a certain maximum at which he would rather withdraw from the market than raise his offer further This maximum is determined by two valuations Nothing is said in the text of the buyers having a maximum price in their minds The maximum price is spoken of as existing on the market at which the buyers having in their minds valuations withdraw from the market There does not appear any basis for the notion that Wieser had a price concept different from that of his master Menger or of his colleague and friend Bohm Bawerk It would require a direct disclaimer on his part to make such a view reasonable But as Wieser gives no quotable definition he is not in cluded in our list of writers 26The writer discovers an example among the exercises in his own text the Principles of Economics 2d ed 1910 p 574 where the phrase subjective minimum price is used He therefore must apply to himself the foregoing criticism upon others It must be conceded that the popular usage of price as a bid or offer and again as an outside or maximum amount in an ex changers mind is very tempting1912 The Definition of Price 811 The use of the term personal prices is one of those little depart ures of thought which shifts the term before one is aware into a different conceptual field In the case before us both value and price become ambiguous i e the old meaning persists side by side with the new and the vocabulary instead of being enriched is impoverished by the change Price cannot be defined at the same time both as an actual and an estimated quantity of goods with out changing its content essentially XIII Definition without reference to money If the proposal set forth above should meet with acceptance there would remain but one issue to settle to attain a universal concept of price the issue of the monetary vs the nonmonetary characteristic of the price material Here may be greater diffi culty Our count of the definitions shows economists almost equally divided after including with the nonmonetary group a number who admit that at present price most often is expressed in terms of money and after including with the monetary group a number who say that in a regime or barter price was formerly expressed in other goods seeming to imply that so far as cases of barter occur now price may still be in other than monetarv terms These borderline opinions go far towards bridging the divison Most nonmonetary terminologists see in the contrast between the psy chological quality in any good sold and the concrete good what ever it be for which it exchanges a distinction important to main tain Without satisfying this demand no agreement on a price definition can be hoped for with the Austrian the German with a considerable number of the Italian and of the American writers and possibly with a few of the English and of the French On the other hand it might seem that it would be hopeless to attempt to gain over the monetary terminologists to this view The present adherents of the A2 and of the B2 type are alike impressed with the fact that in a very large proportion of the cases price is in a monetary regime expressed in terms of money then why think they be concerned to make room within the con cept of price for the insignificant number of cases in which some other good is given in exchange One friend has suggested that such cases can be wellenough cared for by the term purchasing power over or by value in terms of which carries us back to the difficulty already made clear that the other good is not the812 Frank A Fetter December purchasing power or the value The logic of the contrast between value and price in modern psychological economics is not dependent on the number of concrete cases occurring In Scandinavian lands probably not one time in many millions does the word man when used refer to other than a white man but that is no reason for the Scandinavians narrowing the term man to exclude the black and yellow races The word price has in practice a large number of possible applications to nonmonetary goods for barter is far from extinct and in popular usage the price he paid for it includes almost everything capable of exchange Economics should not cut itself off in even a small num ber of cases from popular usage nor judge that usage solely by the developed moneymarket when this is not necessary to arrive at a logical concept Other adherents of the monetary concept doubtless are appealed to by the argument as framed by Davenport that some term for this money relation this expression of exchange power in terms of a conventionally specialized money commodity is imperatively called for But with the nonmonetary concept there is no such void in our terminology as it is assumed would exist The difficulty has no reality for the reason that with both types of concept it is necessary to indicate in concrete terms in every case expressly or by the context the kind and quantity of goods comprising price Monetary price must be in dollars and cents marks and pfennigs etc No abstract quantitative expression of price has any meaning The price is so many or so muchwhat and for what measure Wheat is so many cents per bushel cloth so many pence per yard The statement is not simplified or shortened in the least by limiting the definition of price to money It is this necessary condition of indicating what monetary system or material is referred to that enables the adherent of the monetary definition to concede on grounds of expe diency this point without any essential loss A greater difficulty is to gain the support of the theorists of the RicardianMill school Mills view that the contrast between money and other goods constitutes the only distinction between price and value has left a deep impression on economic thought But only the living economists need unite now in this decision and it is questioiable whether anyone today can after deliberation approve the reason given by Mill The psychological studies of1912 The Definition of Price 813 recent decades have so far entered into the general economic con sciousness as to make it impossible longer to identify the pur chasing power of a commodity with the other commodity though the phrase may still be repeated Those who prefer to take value primarily in its objective sense as powerinexchange must distinguish between the quality and the object which it purchases And when this distinction is made by an objectivevalue theorist he is no longer any more bound than is a subjectivevalue theorist to maintain that the monetary character is essential to the price definition Other choices lie open to him In practice actual prices by the nonmonetary definitions in most cases and increasingly with the extension of the moneyecon omy are quoted in terms of money but that does not necessitate framing the definitions in monetary terms either on practical or on theoretical grounds Every actual expression of prices to be complete must contain express or implied a specification of the pricegood General prices must be in gold or in silver or in inconvertible paper whatever has become the standard money of the time and place The definition of price at which we have arrived is Price is the quantity of goods given or received in exchange for another good We can hardly improve upon Mengers wording Prices are the quantities of goods appearing in exchange though we inight add when viewed as payment for the goods against which they are exchanged It may seem to the reader that this paper has gone into needless detail and to needless length but the writer must still regret that in hastily passing over the evidence available on minor matters he may have left removable causes of misunderstanding The history of this subject is so filled with examples of difficulties glossed over that we can hardly err by proving all things Our hope may be unrealized The time may not yet have come when general agreement may be reached on an international definition of price and thus a beginning be made toward a system of scientific terminology But this essay may at least serve to clear away some misunderstandings make more evident the nature of the problem and perhaps prepare the way for its solution FRANK A FETTER Princeton University

he feel he is in a stream bearing him to his preordained destination and in him we have what we please to call the confirmed criminal Societys work now is to take him from the current before it grasps him too fast To do this we must know him We must know as far as we may his very being his soul his manner of thought We must know how he is physically We must know the things which make him what he is We must know those who influence his life his parents his friends his teachers his employers The causes which lead the children into offenses against the law and tend to make them criminal are as multitudinous as the conditions and en vironments which surround them The cry is often heard when a boy goes wrong It is the parents fault Often it is But the work of the state in such a case is to better the parent that the child may be bettered to deal sympathetically or severely as necessity may require with the delinquent or unfortunate father or mother to check dissipation to prevent separation of spouses to aid the distressed in a word to build and foster the home that to its young inmates it may be an influence for good This is constructive work It requires neverceasing attention upon the individual case as the erection of a building needs the supervision of the architect until it is completed Creating conditions means among other things that society must guard his health that the state must enact laws which prevent his young life being used as a tool that he shall not be forced under the guise of business to serve the wants of libertines that he shall not be compelled to give the time needed for schooling or for rest to the demands of employers that he shall not be permitted to gather with his fellows unattended in places of amuse ment during the night hours and in promiscuous company that he shall not be offered or allowed the temptations of the saloon that he shall not be given the chance to hear the cry of the streets In these matters the state may and must act positively So long as we must live in crowds we must enact laws which will protect children from the dangers of crowds No child should be permitted to visit places of amusement unaccompanied by some proper guardian Let us realize thoroughly that a tendency to crime has a cause and that by the removal of the cause the making of a criminal may be prevented and let us use our efforts to the end that every influence of the state may be used to work upon the cause J W G The Alternative Death Penalty in Nevada Criticiiedi The editor of the Central Law Journal in a recent article criticizes the Nevada statute which al lows condemned persons to choose one of two modes for the carrying into ef fect of the death sentence See this Journal May 1911 pp 9192 The con stitutionality of the statute says the editor of the Journal is doubtful and in additional it is repugnant to the morality of the common law which treats suicide as a felo de se punishable by forfeiture of estate In McMahon v State 53 So 89 says the editor the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of murder of one whose defense was that the deceased took his own life The trial court instructed that if the death was the result of preconcert    between the men that each take his own life then the survivor would be guilty of murder in the first or second degree This proposition was held to involve the question whether suicide 285NEW METHOD OF DEATH PENALTY IN NEVADA was a felony It was said At common law selfmurder was a felony but since with us no forfeiture of estate penalizes the felon and since the dead cannot be punished no penalty can be inflicted on the selfdestroyer But collateral consequences may and do upon occasion depend upon the felonious ness of selfmurder    That intentional selfdestruction by one without avoiding mental distemper is felo de se is a generally recognized criminal doctrine The Alabama decision is wholesome just as every implication to be drawn from the Nevada statute is pernicious consistent however we may say with the tenderness of divorce legislation for the gaily bedecked and bedizened who seek its hospitable doors But of course the supposedly sufficient answer to all of this is that death impending there is no choice in regard to life at all and the selection of the means of death is not the choosing of death This may be true  Let us take the alternative proposed The felon will have choice of death by hanging or death by poison If he elects poison he is supplied with hydrochloric acid sufficient in quantity to cause instantaneous death If he makes no choice he is hung It is well known that hanging may not pro duce instantaneous death Indeed it has been known to prove abortive and always it has been the custom for experts to say when death has supervened before the body is cut down Therefore when a state which looks upon hanging as a civilized mode of execution and invites one sentenced to death to kill himself more expeditiously than the state will kill him it invites him to selfmurder Suppose that a state extended choice in this matter by providing death by torture slow but absolutely certain to the end intended Would not a man having the liberty of choice be taking his own life if he forestalls the appreciable period he would live during the torture Among Christians generally it is regarded as heinous in morals that one should shorten his own life to escape from trouble There may be and un doubtedly are some who do not thus regard selfdestruction They conceive that their lives belong to them to do with whatsoever they will But a man who so believes seems to us bereft of a proper sense of responsibility to others But whichsoever view is correct no state has the right to treat with con tempt the conscientious scruple that no one should compass his own death be fore allotted time to die This assertion is not met by saying that those who thus believe should refuse to elect Furthermore it may be asked is there any mercifulness in the privilege of choice Why should the state hang before a doomed mans eyes what would but add to the misery of his situation and correspondingly afflict those who would weep over his death Any law smacks of barbarity which may tend to interfere with the resignation the condemned and his relatives may seek in such an extremity The sentiment behind it is maudlin in part and excessively materialistic as to the rest Is there or not a serious question here of the validity of such legisla tion A judgment may in a civil suit give alternative relief but it will hardly be contended that a sentence may inflict alternative punishment except that in misdemeanor imprisonment may be the alternative of refusal to pay a fine This however is not a real alternative It presupposes inability to pay the fine But in a sentence of death the physical pain involved in its being carried into 286NEW METHOD OF DEATH PENALTY IN NEVADA effect is part and parcel of the sentence as is also whatever mental suffering is endured If one method involves less of either than the other there is an alternative that suggests a want of uniformity in the sentence of death If there is no material difference in the modes of infliction then why would the law be enacted The very enactment of the law presupposes that it speaks regarding as matter of substance and not of form J W G Should the Accused Be Forced to Testify in His Own CaseHon R A Burch justice of the Supreme Court of Kansas in a recent address before the State Association of County Attorneys of Kansas advocated a change in the criminal code so as to require accused persons to testify in regard to the facts of any charge against them Among other things he said Attention has been called to the fact that laws and institutions suffer in the estimation of the people because having been established for conditions now outgrown they resist their own improvement too long and are in adequate to meet the needs which social progress has evolved A single illustration from the criminal law may be considered Many a guilty man escapes punish ment to the confusion and humiliation Qf the law and order forces because he can not be required to testify and because as a corollary his failure to tes tify can not be considered to his prejudice The prosecution must disclose everything to him The names of all known material witnesses for the state must be indorsed on the indictment or information at the time it is filed The accused then sits by until the last item of evidence against him has been in troduced at the trial when he springs a story carefully prepared to suit the exigencies of the case or if he chooses remains silent while the court in solemn phrase instructs the jury that he is presumed to be innocent of every element of the offense charged against him and that no inference can be drawn from his failure to testify The existing rules had their origin in humane efforts to protect unhappy prisoners who had no counsel who could not testify at the trial and who could not appeal from star chamber prac tices and from the barbarities of a penal system which is now regarded with feelings of horror At the present time there is no valid reason why a per son charged with crime should not be obliged by law to testify at any stage of the proceedings precisely the same as any other witness with knowledge of the facts Suggestions as to Trial ProcedureIn a recent article in the Chicago Legal News Franklin A Beecher lays down a number of propositions which in his judgment ought to govern in the procedure of a criminal trial He says Of all the departments of human knowledge law is the least progressive In many respects it still continues in the old trodden path of tradition and any suggestion to deviate from the old beaten path is met with the argument that the old principles as established by the judges and jurists of the past are the best because they were the result of that mysterious gift of legal lore and logic by which the law became the perfection of human reason so that nothing is left for the modern judge and jurist to do but to follow in the path of the past Trial procedure is very much the same today as it was in the sixteenth century With few changes in evidence especially relating to competency of witnesses etc the law of evidence has undergone comparatively few changes 287

throughout much in the same way as in his previous work In general the remarks we have made on Professor Grooss previous work Psychological Review Vol 6 p 86 ff apply also to this The last book is larger fuller and more cautions but it lacks in clearness and directness and penetration Though sometimes suggestive it is rarely illuminating Very comprehensive and learned it is useful as a summary and dis cussion but it has not the vitality of real re search The book is swamped in quotation and we have more a history and discussion of opinion than a firsthand investigation Though by bringing in everything of the least relevancy Professor Groos attains a certain completeness it is greatly to be doubted whether in breaking ground in a new subject this is the most useful method The foundations for a real science of play can only be laid by the direct detailed study of the lifehistory of the individual the results being made to an extent verifiable by the photograph and phonograph HIRAM M

SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND ARTICLES The Botanical Gazette for April contains the following leading articles A Conspectus of the Genus Lilium by F A Waugh which brings together and organizes the widely scat tered material Some Appliances for Elemen tary Study of Plant Physiology by W F Ganong in which are described with figures a temperature stage a clinostat a selfrecording auxanometer an osmometer a respiration ap paratus a germination box a transpiration de vice the graduation of roots tubes etc and a rootpressuregauge Oogenesis in Pinus Laricio by Charles J Chamberlain a paper with plates in which the following results are announced The ventral canal cell occasionally develops as an egg the chromatin of the egg nucleus takes the form of nucleoli which finally collect from all parts of the nucleus to a definite area near the center and there develop into a typical spirem the chromatin of the two sexual nuclei is in the spirem stage at fusion the fate of the spin dle indicates that the kinoplasmic fibers arise through a transformation of the cytoplasmic re ticulum a continuation of The Ecological Re lations of the Vegetation of the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan by Henry C Cowles the present part profusely illustrated discussing the encroachment on preexisting plant societies and the capture of the dunecomplex by vege tation Under Briefer Articles Julia W Snow describes with plate the life history of a new Ulvella U Americana and Bradley M Davis discusses recent work on the life history of the Rhodophycese The number closes with the usual reviews notes for students and news American Chemical Journal April 1899 On the Hydrolysis of Acid Amides  By I Remsen and E E Reid The rate of hydrolysis of a large number of acid amides was compared and certain groups or positions of groups were found to exercise a marked influence on the re action In general the results agree with those obtained in the study of the rate of formation of ethereal salts Ortho groups were found to exert a very marked protective influence in many cases Aliphatic Sulphonic Acids By E P Kohler The author describes the preparation and reaction of 1 brome 620 SCIENCESCIENCE thylene sulphonic acid and its derivatives A Serviceable Generator for Hydrogen Sul phide By W P Bradley This generator is so arranged that all the acid is used and it only needs filling several times a year The iron salt formed does not mix with the acid but is drawn off and thrown away J ELLIOTT GILPIN SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES THE annual stated meeting of the National Academy of Sciences was held at Columbian University beginning Tuesday April 18th and ending Thursday April 20th The members missed the rooms to which they were so long accustomed in the National Museum but the growth of this institution has been so marked that there is no longer any room available for such purposes A committee has been ap pointed to secure if possible permanent quar ters and it is hoped that in view of the relations of the Academy to the United States govern ment rooms may be set aside in some public building for the use of the Academy The papers presented at the public sessions were as follows 1 Ophiura Brevispina W K Brooks and Caswell Grave 2 The Shadow of a Plant A Hall 3 On the Tanner Deep Sea Tow Net A Agassiz 4 On the Acalephs of the East Coast of the United States A

The Academy adjourned to meet in New York next November THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF WASHIIGTON THE 499th meeting of the Society was held at 8 p m April 1st in the assembly room of the Cosmos Club The first paper was by Mr G W Littlehales on  The Prospective Place of the Solar Azimuth Tables in the Problem of Accelerating Ocean Transit A brief abstract of this paper will appear later in SCIENCE The second paper was by Mr E G Fisher on Data Relating to Nickel Iron Alloy The third paper was by Mr H A Hazen on  Elec tric and Magnetic Weather Mr Hazen said in part One of the earliest coincidences between the weather and magnetism was published in a set of curves in the Annual Report of the C S 0 for 1882 showing the exact correspondence be tween the curves of diurnal range of magnetic declination and pressure of the air In April 1898 a period of 25912 days was found from temperatures for 20 years at Omaha Neb and this period applied to the annual observations in the United States from 1870 to 1898 about 400 occurrences showed a marked maximum point on one day throughout The largest number of auroras observed in any one day in the United States fell upon this same day not included however in the count In February 1899 Dr Ekholm sent a paper in which he had established a period of 2592876 days from ob servations of the auroras in Sweden for 175 years This period applied to the above obser vations gave almost a straight line The great danger of using the twentyfourhour change in any element was pointed out It was shown APRIL 28 1899

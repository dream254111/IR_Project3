ASSOCIATION SHOULD BE SCIENTIFIC OR CONSISTENT THE AIM OF SUCH AN ORGANIZATION IS TO CREATE PUBLIC OPINION OR CAPTURE VOTES AND FOR SUCH A PURPOSE ERROR IS QUITE AS EFFECTIVE AS TRUTH NEVERTHELESS THE HONEST STUDENT OF FINANCE MUST FEEL A BIT DISHEART ENED WHEN HE READS THE TWENTYFOUR PAMPHLETS ISSUED BY THE BRITISH GOLD STANDARD DEFENCE ASSOCIATION AND NOTES THE INCONSISTENCIES FALLACIES AND NON SEQUITURS WHICH THE EXIGENCIES OF DEFENCE ARE APPARENTLY SUPPOSED TO JUSTIFY IF THE BRITISH PUBLIC READS THESE LEAFLETS IT IS PROBABLY READY TO SUPPORT GOLD BUT ITS UNDERSTANDING MUST BE IN A DENSE FOG ON THE MONEY QUESTION THE LIST OF AUTHORS INCLUDES SUCH NAMES AS LORD FARRER H D MCLEOD LORD PLAYFAIR SIR JOHN LUBBOCK G SHAWLEFEVRE AND HENRY LABOUCHERE NOWHERE IN THESE PAMPHLETS DOES ONE DISCOVER A FAIR STATEMENT OF THE POSITION AND ARGUMENTS OF THE SOCALLED INTERNATIONAL BIMETAL LIST ON THE CONTRARY EACH AUTHOR APPEARS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE MEANING OF BIMETALLISM AND OPPOSES IT WITH DIFFERENT ARGU MENTS MR MCLEOD SHOWS BY REFERENCE TO THE HISTORY OF BIMETAL LISM IN FRANCE THAT IT IS A POLICY DISCREDITED BY EXPERIENCE UNSUPPORTED BY A SCINTILLA OF EVIDENCE EITHER FROM THEORY OR FACT LEAFLET NO 6 HOWEVER CONDEMNS INTERNATIONAL BIMETALLISM BECAUSE IT IS A WHOLLY NEW THING BOTH IN THEORY AND PRACTICE SEVERAL WRITERS OBJECT TO A LARGER USE OF SILVER ON THE GROUND THAT THE PUBLIC DOES NOT LIKE TO EMPLOY IT AS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BULK GOLD BECAUSE OF ITS GREAT VALUE AND SMALL BULK IT IS POINTED OUT HAS BEEN SELECTED BY THE CIVILIZED WORLD AS THE METAL BEST QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS MONEY AND LORD PLAYFAIR IN PAMPHLET NO 13 DECLARES THAT THE GREAT BULK OF THE 676OOOOOO GOLD IN THE UNITED STATES IS CIRCULATING IN TRADE WHEREAS OUR SILVER COIN IS STORED IN THE CELLARS OF THE TREASURY MR OTTOMAR HAUPT HOWEVER IN THE PAMPHLET ON THE SCARCITY OF GOLD EXPLAINS THE LARGE ACCUMULATION OF GOLD IN THE BANKS OF EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES BY THE DECLARATION THAT THE PUBLIC DOES NOT WANT TO USE GOLD BUT PREFERS PAPER MONEY THESE ARE SAMPLES OF THE SORT OF INFORMATION AND ARGUMENT WHICH ONE FINDS IN THESE LEAFLETS DEFENDING THE GOLD STANDARD 92THERE IS THROUGHOUT AN ABSENCE OF CANDOR FOR INSTANCE SHAW LEFEVRE WHILE ATTACKING THE CLAIM THAT INDIAS EXPORT TRADE HAS BEEN BENEFITED BY THE FALL IN THE PRICE OF SILVER POINTS TRIUMPHANTLY TO THE FACT THAT INDIAS EXPORTS IN 1895 WERE RELATIVELY SMALL NOT WITHSTANDING THE LOW PRICE OF SILVER NOW AS A MATTER OF FACT INDIA HAS NOT BEEN UPON THE SILVER STANDARD SINCE 1893 AND CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF SILVER HAVE NOT BEEN REFLECTED IN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE INDIAN CURRENCY MR SHAWLEFEVRE MAKES NO NOTE OF THIS IMPORTANT FACT NOR DOES HE CALL ANY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE GREAT FALL OF SILVER IN I890 WHEN INDIA WAS UPON THE SILVER STANDARD WAS FOLLOWED BY A IOO PER CENT INCREASE IN THE EXPORTS OF WHEAT FROM INDIA SIR JOHN LUBBOCK DENIES EMPHATICALLY THAT SILVER HAS BEEN DEMONETIZED IN RECENT YEARS AND HE SUPPORTS HIS DENIAL BY SHOWING THAT LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILVER HAVE BEEN COINED IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND ARE NOW IN USE AS MONEY HE APPARENTLY HAS NO CONCEPTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE USE OF A METAL AS MONEY OR AS A STANDARD OF VALUE AND ITS USE AS THE MATERIAL OUT OF WHICH CREDIT MONEY IS MADE IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES SILVER IS NO MORE MONEY TODAY THAN IS PAPER ON THE WHOLE THESE GOLD STANDARD PAMPHLETS DESERVE LITTLE COM MENDATION FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW IT IS DOUBTFUL IF THEY CONVERT OR CONVINCE THE IGNORANT AND THEY ARE

OF THE TOTAL STATE EXPENDITURES 37 PER CENT WAS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ON THE SIDE OF RECEIPTS THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE INCREASED RETURNS FROM TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS AND

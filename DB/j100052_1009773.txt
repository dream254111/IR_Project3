j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1009773,Notes,i242515,BOOK DEPARTMENT NOTZS IT IS PERHAPS not reasonable to expect that the arguments used by a Defence Association should be scientific or consistent The aim of such an organization is to create public opinion or capture votes and for such a purpose error is quite as effective as truth Nevertheless the honest student of finance must feel a bit disheart ened when he reads the twentyfour pamphlets issued by the British Gold Standard Defence Association and notes the inconsistencies fallacies and non sequiturs which the exigencies of defence are apparently supposed to justify If the British public reads these leaflets it is probably ready to support gold but its understanding must be in a dense fog on the money question The list of authors includes such names as Lord Farrer H D McLeod Lord Playfair Sir John Lubbock G ShawLefevre and Henry Labouchere Nowhere in these pamphlets does one discover a fair statement of the position and arguments of the socalled International Bimetal list On the contrary each author appears to have a different view of the meaning of bimetallism and opposes it with different argu ments Mr McLeod shows by reference to the history of bimetal lism in France that it is a policy discredited by experience unsupported by a scintilla of evidence either from theory or fact Leaflet No 6 however condemns international bimetallism because it is a wholly new thing both in theory and practice Several writers object to a larger use of silver on the ground that the public does not like to employ it as a medium of exchange on account of its bulk Gold because of its great value and small bulk it is pointed out has been selected by the civilized world as the metal best qualified to serve as money and Lord Playfair in pamphlet No 13 declares that the great bulk of the 676oooooo gold in the United States is circulating in trade whereas our silver coin is stored in the cellars of the Treasury Mr Ottomar Haupt however in the pamphlet on The Scarcity of Gold explains the large accumulation of gold in the banks of Europe and the United States by the declaration that the public does not want to use gold but prefers paper money These are samples of the sort of information and argument which one finds in these leaflets defending the gold standard 92There is throughout an absence of candor For instance Shaw Lefevre while attacking the claim that Indias export trade has been benefited by the fall in the price of silver points triumphantly to the fact that Indias exports in 1895 were relatively small not withstanding the low price of silver Now as a matter of fact India has not been upon the silver standard since 1893 and changes in the price of silver have not been reflected in the purchasing power of the Indian currency Mr ShawLefevre makes no note of this important fact nor does he call any attention to the fact that the great fall of silver in I890 when India was upon the silver standard was followed by a ioo per cent increase in the exports of wheat from India Sir John Lubbock denies emphatically that silver has been demonetized in recent years and he supports his denial by showing that large amounts of silver have been coined in Europe and the United States in the last twenty years and are now in use as money He apparently has no conception of the difference between the use of a metal as money or as a standard of value and its use as the material out of which credit money is made In Europe and the United States silver is no more money today than is paper On the whole these Gold Standard pamphlets deserve little com mendation from any point of view It is doubtful if they convert or convince the ignorant and they are liable to injure the cause of the gold standard with men who think In logic candor and in formation they are far below the Sound Currency pamphlets issued by the Reform Club of New York City TOGETHER WITH THE Jubilee Edition of John Morleys Life of Richard Cobden  noticed in the March number of the ANNALS t T Fisher Unwin has brought out an interesting volume of free trade essays sympathetically introduced to the public by Mr Richard Gowing These consist of three essays which appeared in Cos mopolis for June I896 by Henry Dunckley Paul LeroyBeaulieu and Theodore Barth the speeches of the Hon Leonard Courtney and of the Right Hon Charles Pelham Villiers delivered at the Cobden Club dinner last summer and the address of the club to the latter veteran statesman All of these essays are favorable to free trade but there is not much of jubilation in the account of Richard Cobden His Work and the Outcome of his Ideas supplied by Richard Cobden and thejubilee of Free Trade With an

economist free trade has been losing ground since the death of Cobden in I866 Even in England he perceives symptoms of the degeneration which is strongly marked on the Continent and in this country The other writers have no misgivings either in regard to the beneficence of a free trade policy or of the ultimate triumph of free trade ideas Taken as a whole the volume contains in readable form some of the most important arguments in favor of Englands chosen policy and much evidence as to the beneficial results that have followed the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 PROFESSOR GIDDINGS IS to be congratulated upon the unusually hearty reception accorded to his Principles of Sociology A French translation has already appeared and the book is now being translated into Spanish by Professor Adolpho Posada of the University of Oviedo The authors skill in the use of clear and concise language combined with a happy style makes his work deservedly popular He has however added materially to its usefulness in the classroom by the preparation of a syllabus en titled The Theory of Socialization  The teacher who desires to use the Principles in classwork will find the syllabus with its definite propositions of very great value It will enable him to combine so much of Professor Giddings theory as he may desire with lectures of his own without any inconvenience whatsoever It will add also materially to a clear conception of Professor Gid dings theoretical position In many ways the statements in the syllabus are clearer than the corresponding passages in the Prin ciples  and one can see much more easily the proportions of the whole work and where the author desires to lay the greatest em phasis The first chapter on The Modes of Purposive Activity is almost entirely new and adds greatly to the value of the whole book The chapter on The Social Mind and Social Control is the one which it is to be hoped the author will work over and restate in the future In reply to various criticisms of the use which Profes sor Giddings makes of the term Social Mind he has modified it in a way to make it a less useful and consistent concept in his whole  The Theory of Socialization A

New York The Macmillan Co 1897NOTES system than the same ideas combined a little differently might be Professor Giddings has been exceptionally free from the confusion in many sociological treatises arising from an injudicious use of biolog ical terminology While no one will accuse him any longer of sup posing that there is a social ego or mysterious transcendental being which manifests the phenomena of the social mind he should free his students from any possibility of misunderstanding by giving us some new term for social mind In an appendix to the present book the author has worked out an exceedingly interesting table on the basis of census figures illustrating the application of his theory in relation to the degree of kinship in the population of the United States When in time students have worked out these formulae on the basis of other sta tistical reports and for other countries as well as the United States a very interesting test of the accuracy of Professor Giddings rea soning will have been made Le Malentendu Monetaire by M Adolphe Houdard is a keen criticism of gold monometallism and bimetallism at a fixed ratio by one who is not an apostle of either theory The claims and preten sions of the monometallists are subjected to a searching investiga tion Inasmuch as bimetallism in the eyes of the author consists in the simultaneous employment of Doth gold and silver he finds that the monometallist contention ignores facts and places before us an ideal which is impossible of attainment On the other hand he finds equal fault with the fixity of ratio which forms a cardinal point in the bimetallist creed This then is the monetary misun derstanding that the choice of policy is restricted to these two policies Many years ago Joseph Garnier suggested that gold and silver circulate concurrently without a fixed ratio between them To this suggestion the author returns In some detail he develops the possibility of a simultaneous existence of a gold standard based upon the louis and a silver standard based upon the franc one destined for the larger payments of mercantile life the other for the smaller ones Up to the extent of perhaps five louis there should be a legal relation between values in order that commerce be not impeded by difficulties of making change That such a plan would profoundly modify commercial usages the author is free to admit but would he declares be beneficial It is difficult to see how such a proposition if practicable would meet the fundamental Le Malentendu Monetaire By ADOLPHE HOUDARD Pp 48 Price 250 fr Paris Guillaumin et Cie 1897 9596 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY objection of the bimetallists that the gold basis leads infallibly under present conditions to an appreciation of the monetary unit STUDENTS OF SCIENTIFIC socialism and especially those interested in Karl Marx will be glad to know that a convenient and cheap edition of one of Marxs earliest books has just appeared Miskre de la Philosophie is in many respects one of the most interestig and typical of Marxs publications It was more than a reply to Proudhon It was written originally in French in the winter of i846 and 1847 almost at the beginning of Marxs literary activity Engels wrote a long preface for a German translation which was published in I892 in which he interpreted the essay as of value to German socialists as a criticism of the position of Rodbertus This preface is reproduced in a French translation in the present edition and three appendices of more than passing interest are also included in this volume one gives a French translation of an article by Marx on Proudhon giving his personal estimate of the man This was printed originally in the Social Demokrat in January 1865 The second appendix contains an extract from Marxs work entitled  Zur Krilik der Polilischen Economie in which Marx shows that Proudhons notion concerning the organization of exchange in credit banks originated with John Gray and was elaborated by him in the book entitled The Social System etc a Treatise on the Principle of Exchange Edinburgh 1831 The third appendix is a lecture by Marx on Free Trade delivered in French at Brussels January I848 The essay on Proudhon which covers about two hundred pages of this small edition is full of spirit and in many places shows Marx at his best His wide reading and ready use of material made him a rather formidable critic while his impatience with any one who did not agree with his onesided interpretation of history made him unfair Many things in this early essay do not tally with his later views as expressed in his work on Capital but the strong points as well as the limitations of his method are well illustrated in this earlier work THE STATE DEPARTMENT has issued

government are described in detail as well as recent important events relating to monetary legislation and to the progress of inter national bimetallism Mr Muhleman takes his facts and statistics from official sources and his volume will be found exceedingly help ful to those who wish to have in condensed form a compendium of monetary information A RECENT ADDITION to the series of theses on the taxing systems of different states brought out by students of Professor Seligman of Columbia University is an essay by Mr F H Noble on Taxation in Iowa t The historical portion of this monograph is decidedly scrappy and unsatisfactory but the account of the existing taxing system is ample and extracts from the laws now in force which con stitute the body of the essay will prove serviceable to students who do not wish to consult the original statutes The chapter on the General Property Tax suffers from a lack of careful revision more than any other portion of the essay Little attempt is made to show how this important feature of the taxing system has developed or to explain the interesting deviations from the principle of a general property tax which Iowa has introduced If the author had given some attention in his concluding chapter to the actual defects in the taxing system of Iowa as a working system and suggested reforms in harmony with the historical development of that system the reader would gladly forego the defence of direct and collateral inheritance taxes which that chapter contains  Monetary Systems of the World By MAURICE L MUHLEMAN Pp 239 New York Chas H

DICTIONARY of political economy edited by MM Leon Say and Joseph ChailleyBert has recently been brought down to date through the publication of a supplement The editors at first contemplated a new edition the earlier one having been exhausted some time since but were dissuaded from this idea by the representations of the purchasers of the dictionary that a supplement would answer the same purpose and save expense to both publishers and public Among the new articles we note biographies of Cairnes Hegel David Hume Jevons Leibnitz Leslie Roscher Leon Say Spinoza Thorold Rogers and West dis cussions of the English School since J S Mill Christian Socialism Cereals Railroads etc all of which are welcome additions Mr Henry Higgs contributes the article on the English School which contains a very fairminded review of recent English work in economics In general style the Supplement is uniform with the Dictionnaire and its articles compare very favorably with those of the earlier publication THE NEW YORK STATE LIBRARY has recently issued a Bulletin No 8 dealing with state finance statisticst The receipts ex penditures endowment funds and indebtedness for the years 1890 and 1895 are compared Taking the aggregate of state budgets the year I890 shows a surplus of receipts over expenditures whereas I895 shows a deficiency The total receipts for the former year  89o were iIi 195003 of the latter  895 12492592 an increase of about 12 per cent while the expenditures meantime rose from ro5904997 to 129 129225 or 22 per cent The report points out the very interesting fact that the total expenditures by the fortyfive states in 1895 were barely a fourth of those of the United States Treasury while New York City alone spent 40 per cent as much as all the states combined Of the total state expenditures 37 per cent was for educational purposes On the side of receipts the most important changes are to be found in the increased returns from taxation of corporations and the inheritance tax The former has risen from 12354864 in 1890 to I69o8II2 in 1895 an increase of 38 per cent Inheritance taxes rose from I886509 to 40o6841 during the same period The tendency seems to be toward special taxes involving the gradual subordination or even abandonment of  Supplement au Nouveau Dictionnaire cdlconomie Politique By MM LION SAY and JOSEPH CHAILLEYBERT Pp vi 271 Price

in I895 THE FIFTH VOLUME of Traills Social England which has lately appeared carries the narrative along from the accession of George I to the Battle of Waterloo and thus covers the formative period in the history of modern England There are twentytwo con tributors to this volume each considering some different phase of Englands social development and the result as in previous volumes is a somewhat uneven sketch of the history of the century covered The economic student will turn first of all to the sections on agri culture written by Mr Prothero and those on manufacturing written by Mr Beazley In the contributions of both these gentlemen will be found a good deal of interesting material not easily accessible elsewhere but little calculated to modify preconceived opinions in regard to the agricultural and the manufacturing development of England during the last century The volume is supplied with useful bibliographies a full table of contents and an excellent index THE INTEREST AROUSED by the work of Lombroso and his school has given rise not only to a large number of volumes devoted to the various aspects of criminal anthropology but also to two period icals one in Italy and one in France devoted to this field In Ger many the doctrines have made comparatively slow progress but a widespread interest has been awakened in the problems raised This now finds expression in a new journal Zeitschrift fur Criminalanthropologie Gefdngnisswissenschaft und Prostitutionswe sen of which the first issue appeared March 20 I897 The editor is Dr Walter Wenge of Berlin and the contributors comprise the principal criminologists of Germany and Austria Lombroso and modern criminal anthropology crime and insanity the handwriting of criminals and kindred topics drawn from the pathological aspects of human society are discussed in the first issue The journal will doubtless furnish a useful repository for articles and discussions which must otherwise appear sporadically in

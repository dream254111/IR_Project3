in equity for the recovery of 90 shares of stock to which the plaintiff claimed to be entitled by virtue of a contract between himself and the defendant The defendant interposes a counterclaim for 35000 for the failure of the plaintiff to deliver some of the machinery and for defects in that which was delivered Held one judge dis senting that the counterclaim was proper Maag v Maag Gear Co 1st Dept 1920 193 App Div 759 184 N Y Supp 630 The purpose of the codes in creating counterclaims was to avoid circuity of action consequently the courts interpret the codes liberally in order to effectuate that purpose See North Chicago Rolling Mill Co v St Louis Ore  Steel Co 1894 152 U S 596 615 14 Sup Ct 710 Scott v Waggoner 1914 48 Mont 536 543 139 Pac 454 And so where as in New York the Code of Civil Procedure 501 provides that the defendant may plead as a counterclaim a cause of action arising out of the contract or transaction   or connected with the subject of the transaction or in an action on a contract any other cause of action on contract existing at the commencement of the action a defendant may plead as a counter claim to a contract action a cause of action sounding in tort Cf Advance Thresher Co v Klein 1911 28 S Dak 177 133 N W 51 Scott v Waggoner supra Al though where the tort does not arise out of and is in no wise connected with the action it may not be asserted as a counterclaim Kuhn v Heavenrich Co 1902 115 Wis 447 91 N W 994 In some few jurisdictions a defendant may even plead as a counterclaim to a tort action a cause of action sounding in tort on the ground that the entire physical encounter is the entity giving rise to the plaintiffs cause of action Powell v Powell 1915 160 Wis 504 152 N W 168 Hackney v Fetsch 1913 123 Minn 447 143 N V 1128 contra Adams v Schwartz 1910 137 App Div 230 122 N Y Supp 41 But even under Adams v Schwartz if the defendants counterclaim involves the same issues as the plaintiffs cause the counterclaim may be set up Deagan v Weeks 1901 67 App Div 410 73 N Y Supp 641 In an action to obtain a specific chattel a defendant may plead as a counterclaim a cause of action giving rise to money damages Holmberg v Will 1915 52 Okla 745 153 Pac 832 Many jurisdictions do not allow such counterclaims on the ground that they do not tend to diminish or defeat the plaintiffs recovery since to give the defendant damages does not affect the plaintiffs right to the chattel Glide v Kayser 1904 142 Cal 419 76 Pac 50 In the instant case the counterclaim arises out of the contract upon which the plaintiff bases his action In sustaining the counterclaim the court is following the better view in that in accord with the pur pose of the code it avoids multiplicity of suits and possible injustice PLEADING AND PRACTICEPAYMENT INTO COURTCOMMUNICATION OF FACT TO JURYThe plaintiff claimed f1153 as damages in his complaint The defend ant admitted its liability and paid 500 into court to meet the plaintiffs claim The plaintiff refiused to accept this and the question of damages was left to the jury Counsel for the plaintiff asked leave to communicate to the jury the amount paid into court Held neither the amount paid into court nor the fact that there has been such payment may be communicated to the jury Flavell v Christ Church Tramway Board 1920 N Z L R Part II 127 The original purpose and effect of paying money into court was to avoid the difficulty and hazard of pleading a tender It was confined at first to actions of debt Chase Blackstones Commentaries 4th ed 1914 775 It was extended in England in 1833 to some personal actions for damages Civil Procedure Act 3  4 Will IV c 42  21 The rule that when pay ment is made into court no communication shall be made to the jury of the payment or of the amount was adopted in England in 1893 Rules Sup CtRECENT DECISIONS 197 Order XXII R 22 This rule was held not to be ultra vires since it related only to procedure Williams v Goose 1897 1 Q B 471 The amount may not be mentioned even though liability is admitted Jacques v S Essex Waterworks Co 1904 20 T L R 563 This is because the defendant admits liability to some extent but not to the amount paid in Tn the United States the question has not arisen as a tender to be effective must be kept good and must be supported by bringing the money into court at the time of pleading ORiley v Suver 1873 70 Ill 85 Such a tender into court unlike payment under the English practice is an admission of indebtedness to that amount Wilson v Doran 1888 110 N Y 101 17 N E 688 There is no reason therefore why the payment into court and the amount should not be communicated to the jury in this country REAL PROPERTYDESTRUCTION OF CONTINGENT REMAINDERSECFFECT OF WAR RANTYA reserving a life estate for himself conveyed certain lands by warranty deed to B for life with contingent remainders over C subsequent ly purchased all As interest at a sheriffs sale and D in the same manner acquired Bs estate C by separate deeds conveyed to D the life estate and reversion in fee reciting a purpose to defeat the contingent remainders D conveyed back to C an undivided onefifth interest in fee C brings a bill for partition and the contingent remaindermen defend Held two judges dissenting that C was estopped by the warranty of A to defeat the contingent remainders Cs interest in the reversion therefore remaining separate from the life estate and subject to the contingency named Biwer v Martin Il11 1920 128 N E 518 The common law rule of merger defeating contingent remainders operated inexorably Archers Case 1597 1 Co 66b Egerton v Massey 1857 3 C B N s 338 Bond v Moore 1908 236 Ill 576 86 N E 386 The courts heeding intention made but two exceptions to this rule where two estates were created and vested in one person by the same instrument and where the devisee of a life estate acquired the reversion in fee by descent from his testator See Challis Real Property 3rd ed 1911 137 138 2 Reeves Real Property 1909  903 n 1 1 Tiffany Real Property 2nd ed 1920  140 Equity did not favor the defeat of contingent remainders See 1 Fearne Contingent Remainders 10th ed 1844 337 But in Mansell v Mansell 1732 2 P Wms 678 the court declared that the joinder of trustees to preserve contingent remainders in a tortious conveyance of the life estate constituted a breach of trust For this the trustees and all except bona fide purchasers for value were liable in equity whenever the contingency occurred Never theless the legal effect of such a breach of trust was to obliterate the con tingent remainders In the instant case the court gave a novel effect to the warranty Traditionally a warranty required a supporting estate See Rawle Covenants for Title 3rd ed 1860 436 Contingent remainders were never estates See Fearne op cit 2b Butlers Note Challis op cit 86 1 Tiffany op ct  136 137 140 Williams Real Property 23rd ed 1920 400 They crept into our law comparatively late See Y

2 B LIBERTA GERM THIS DIFFERS MNORE IN COLOUR FROM THE VIRGINI ENSIS THAN THE LATTER SPECIES DOES FROM THE MARIANA BUT IT CORRESPONDS WITH VIRGINIENSIS IN THE FORM OF THE THORAX I AM STILL INCLINED TO

POINTS WHICH ARE SOMETIMES OBSCURED BY THE HAIR  I AM INDEBTED TO PROFESSOR WIEDEMAN FOR THE TWO VERY USEFUL WORKS ON  COLEOPTERA MICROPTERA BY GRAVENHORST THEY CONTAIN DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY

SCUTELLUM PUNCTA DUO IMPRESSA ANUS EMARGINATUS IN THE PRESENT SPECIES IS ONLY A SINGLE INDENTATION AT THE BASE OF THE THORACIC GROOVE AND IMMEDIATELY ANTERIOR TO THE SCEUTEL AND THE ANUS IS TRIDENTATED THE MIDDLE TOOTH BEING MORE SLENDER AND ACUTE A VARIETY IN MY COLLEC TION IS DESTITUTE OF THE PUNCTURED STRIAE OF THE ELYTRA 4 B OBSCURA F AND MELSH CATAL HERBST SAYS THE SIDE OF THE

THERE IS SOME CON FUSION AMONGST THE SPECIES OF THE SMALL GROUP TO WHICH THIS BELONGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE SHORT DESCRIPTIONS OF FABRICIUS HERBSTS DESCRIP TION OF THIS SPECIES CANNOT WELL BE MISTAKEN I HAVE FOUND IT IN PENN  FOR THIS VERY ACCURATELY DESCRIPTIVE WORK I AM INDEBTED TO THE POLITENESS OF THE AUTHORSOME NORTH AMERICAN INSECTS 159 SYLVANIA FLORIDA AND ARKANSA IT IS THE ORNATA OF DEJEANS CATA LOGUE AND GERMAR IN A LETTER CONSIDERS IT A NEW SPECIES UNDER THE NAME OF OLYDONIA 10 B ORNATA F ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE PRECEDING THOUGH PER HAPS A LITTLE MORE ROBUST OF A MUCH DARKER COLOUR AND MAY ALSO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM IT BY THE THORAX HAVING THE DORSAL LINE DEEPLY IN DENTED MORE ESPECIALLY ON THE POSTERIOR MARGIN AND BEING OBTUSELY ANGULATED BEHIND THE MIDDLE OF THE LATERAL EDGE DEJEAN SUPPOSED IT A NEW SPECIES AND GAVE IT IN MSS THE NAME OF MULTIGUTTATA BUT I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT IS THE FABRICIAN SPECIES I 1 B TUBULUS F THIS SPECIES IS DESCRIBED AS HAVING BUIT FIVE YEL LOW PUNCTURES ON THE ELYTRA PLACED 2 1 THE LATTER BEING THE LARGEST BUT IT VARIES CONSIDERABLY IN THIS RESPECT SOMETIMES HAVING EIGHT OR NINE SPOTS AND AGAIN OTHER SPECIMENS OCCUR WITH NOT MORE THAN ARE INDICATED BY FABRICIUS IF WE CONSIDER THE POSTERIOR LARGER ONE AS BEING COMPOSED OF TWO CONFLUEENT ONES THE REST OF THE DESCRIPTION AGREES PRECISELY AND EVEN THE NOTED SIZE CORRESPONDS WITH OUR INSECT AS FA BRICIUS SAYS STATURA OMNINO B VOLVULI AT DUPLO ININOR IT MAY INDEED BE AT ONCE DISTINGUISHED FROMN PULCHELLA BY ITS MUCH INFERIOR SIZE VERY DIFFERENT COLOUR AND THE GREATER REGULARITY OF ITS ELYTRAL SPOTS BUIT THE LATERAL EDGE OF ITS THORAX HAS A SIMILAR CURVATURE IT IS THE SMALLEST OF OUR SPECIES OF THE GROUP DISTINGUISHED BY THE WANT OF SCU TEL C AND APPROACHES THE ORNATA BY ITS COLOURING AND THE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT OF THE ELYTRAL SPOTS BUT DIFFERS IN THE REGULAR CUR VATURE OF ITS LATERAL THORACIC EDGE IT IS THE VOLVULUS OF DEJEANS CATA LOGUIE GERMAR BELIEVED IT NEW AND GAVE IT THE NAME OF XANTHOCYMA IT IS THE CULTLA OF WEBER AND DR HARRIS HAS DESCRIBED IT UNDER THE NAME OF GERANII 12 B ACORNIS BRASSY BLACK ANTENNA SHORT SCUTEL GREEN BE NEATH

WAS TAKEN NEAR PHILADELPHIA IT IS EVIDENTLY RELATED TO SALISBURIENSIS AS DESCRIBED BY WEBER TO DECORA F AND SPLENDENS F OF CHINA BUT WEBERS DESCRIPTION STATES THE FORMER TO HAVE STRI ATED ELYTRA WITHOUT ELEVATED LINES THE SPLENDENS HAS ONLY THREE ELE VATED LINES ON THE ELYTRA AND THE DECORA IS LARGER WITH THE TIP OF THE ELYTRA TWOTOOTHED NEITHER CAN IT BE THE STRIATA OLIV AS THE ELYTRA ARE NOT SLIGHTLY BIDENTATE NOR ARE THEIR TWO INNER ELEVATED LINES ABBRE VIATED A VARIETY FOUND BY MY BROTHER B SAY IN NEW JERSEY IS MUCH TINTED WITH COPPER AND IS SMALLER BUT THE SCULPTURE AND FORM ARE THE SAME I MAY ADD AS CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE IMPEDITA ANDTO THE SALISBURIENSIS WEB IN POINT OF COLOURING A SPECIMEN WHICH I FOUND IN NEW JERSEY MANY YEARS SINCE AND WHICH I THEN DESCRIBED UNDER THE NAME OF UL TRAMARINA BUT THE DESCRIPTION WAS MISLAID AND NEVER PUBLISHED AND THE SPECIMNEN IS NOW DEPRIVED OF ITS HEAD AND THORAX THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT REMAINS OF IT  DR HARRIS IS OF OPINION THAT THIS SPECIES THE AURULENTA OF LINNEUS AND OLIVIER AND THE STRIATA OF FABRICIUS ARE THE SAME AND THAT THE DECORA F AND SALISBURIENSIS WEBER AND HERBST ARE IDENTICAL TLLE LATTER DIFFER FROM

TWOFIFTHS OF AN INCH IT IS MORE BRILLIANT THAN EITHER THE IMPEDITA OR SALISBURIENSIS FROM THE FORMER IT IS DISTINGUISHED BY BEING DESTITUTE OF ELEVATED LINES ONI THE ELYTRA AND FROM BOTH BY ITS REGULAR SERIES OF LARGE PROFOUND PUNCTURES 14 B VIRIDICORNIS NOB THIS HAS BEEN MISTAKEN BY AN EUROPEAN ENTOMOLOGIST FOR THE AGRILUS RUFICOLLIS F BUT IT IS VERY DIFFERENT IN FORM WHICH IS MUCH NMORE LIKE THAT OF A TRUE BUPRESTIS AND THE COLOUR IS ALSO DIFFERENT THOUGH THAT OF THE HEAD AND THORAX PROBABLY DECEIVED HIM BEING COPPERY IN EACH THOUGH MUCH MORE OBSCURE IN OUR INSECT I HAVE TAKEN A VARIETY IN THIS STATE DIFFERING GREATLY IN COLOUR SO MUCH SO THAT IT MIGHT LEAD TO ERROR UNLESS ACTUALLY COMPARED THE COLOUR IS BRIGHT GREEN THORAX ON THE DISC TINGED WITH COPPERY WITH A COMMON GREEN TRIANGLE EXTENDING FROM THE HUMERUS TO BEYOND THE MIDDLE BENEATH THE GREEN COLOUR IS LESS BRILLIANT ANOTHER VARIETY HAS THE CUPREOUS COLOUR OF THE THORAX CONFINED TO THE LATERAL MARGIN THE REMAINDER BEING OF THE COLOUR OF THE ELYTRA I MAY ADD TO THE SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION THAT THE HEAD HAS AN ORBICULAR INDENTATION BETWEEN THE EYES AND A SLIGHTLY INDENTED LINE ON THE VER TEX THE SCUTEL IS ALTOGETHER DESTITUTE OF A TRANSVERSE ELEVATED LINE IT IS CONVEX AND WIDELY TRIANGULAR THE ELYTRA ARE MINUTELY SERRATE AT TIP THIS SPECIES HAS CHARACTERS IN COMMON WITH BUPRESTIS AND AGRILUS AND IT MAY PERHAPS BELONG TO THE LATTER AGRILUS MEGERLE 1 A RUFICOLLIS F WE MAY ADD TO THE FABRICIAN CHARACTERS THAT THE HEAD IS PROFOUNDLY INDENTED ON THE VERTEX THE INDENTED LINE IS CONTINUED DOWN THE FRONT THE ELYTRA

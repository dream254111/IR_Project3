is somewhat smaller than the latter species the posterior part of the thorax is a little narrower and the curvature of its lateral edge is somewhat different It inhabits the eastern and middle states 2 B liberta Germ This differs mnore in colour from the virgini ensis than the latter species does from the mariana but it corresponds with virginiensis in the form of the thorax I am still inclined to consider it a variety of that species which Germar does not refer to in his description of liberia 3 B lurida F and Melsh Catal This is the corrosa Deg MSS Herbst Olivier did not observe the anal points which are sometimes obscured by the hair  I am indebted to Professor Wiedeman for the two very useful works on  Coleoptera Microptera by Gravenhorst They contain detailed descriptions of many North American species of the Linnaean genus Staphiylinu8 which now constitute a large family158 DESCRIPTIONS OP AND OBSERVATIONS ON 4 B divaricata Nob That this insect is closely allied to acumi nata F there can be no doubt and Dejean in a letter considers it the same but on reference to the description of that species bv Gyl lenhal Insecta Svecica I find the following characters c thorax ante scutellum puncta duo impressa anus emarginatus In the present species is only a single indentation at the base of the thoracic groove and immediately anterior to the sceutel and the anus is tridentated the middle tooth being more slender and acute A variety in my collec tion is destitute of the punctured striae of the elytra 4 B obscura F and Melsh Catal Herbst says the side of the thorax is rectilinear not arcuated This would agree better with lurida F Imy specimens of obscura are rec tilinear only from before the middle to the base 5 B dentipes Germar TPhis is the characteristica of Melshei mers Catalogue but as no mere catalogue can establish a name Ger mars must be of course retained because it is the first name recogniz able by a description 6 B hybernata F Fromyi the specimen in my collection I am led to believe that the hybernala F is but a variety of the frontalis Oli vier and that both have serrate elytra but I have not at present the means of referring to Oliviers work My specimen is reddish puirple thorax immaculate elytra serrate with but five green spots and the anterior thighs are armed with a prominent tooth 7 B sexguttata Nob Journ Acad Nat Sc This name being preoccupied by Herbst for an American species we chanige it to sex signata 8 B gibbicolis Nob Journ A N S This name is preoccu pied by Illiger for an European species it must therefore be changed 9 B puichella Herbst The volvulus F is probably the same species but which of the two names has the priority I cannot now ascertain not having the date of LIerbsts volume There is some con fusion amongst the species of the small group to which this belongs in consequence of the short descriptions of Fabricius Herbsts descrip tion of this species cannot well be mistaken I have found it in Penn  For this very accurately descriptive work I am indebted to the politeness of the authorSOME NORTH AMERICAN INSECTS 159 sylvania Florida and Arkansa It is the ornata of Dejeans Cata logue and Germar in a letter considers it a new species under the name of olydonia 10 B ornata F About the size of the preceding though per haps a little more robust of a much darker colour and may also be distinguished from it by the thorax having the dorsal line deeply in dented more especially on the posterior margin and being obtusely angulated behind the middle of the lateral edge Dejean supposed it a new species and gave it in MSS the name of multiguttata but I think there is no doubt that it is the Fabrician species I 1 B tubulus F This species is described as having buit five yel low punctures on the elytra placed 2 1 the latter being the largest But it varies considerably in this respect sometimes having eight or nine spots and again other specimens occur with not more than are indicated by Fabricius if we consider the posterior larger one as being composed of two conflueent ones The rest of the description agrees precisely and even the noted size corresponds with our insect as Fa bricius says statura omnino B volvuli at duplo Ininor It may indeed be at once distinguished fromn pulchella by its much inferior size very different colour and the greater regularity of its elytral spots buit the lateral edge of its thorax has a similar curvature It is the smallest of our species of the group distinguished by the want of scu tel c and approaches the ornata by its colouring and the somewhat similar arrangement of the elytral spots but differs in the regular cur vature of its lateral thoracic edge It is the volvulus of Dejeans Cata loguie Germar believed it new and gave it the name of xanthocyma it is the cultla of Weber and Dr Harris has described it under the name of geranii 12 B acornis Brassy black antenna short scutel green be neath

bluishgreen grooved and punctured Inhab Pennsylvania Head conflueiitly punctured green with a cupreous reflection an tenna steelblue at base green labrum green ciliate at tip thorax cupreous with green confluent punctures on some parts of the disk the punctures are sparse scutel oval regularly concave green elytra densely punctured with five dilated grooves and four elevated lilnes the latter sparsely punctured greeni gradually shaded into a blue vitta along the middle suture and outer margin cupreous tip somewhat truncated beneath green cupreousLength threefifths of an inch The specimen was taken near Philadelphia It is evidently related to salisburiensis as described by Weber to decora F and splendens F of China But Webers description states the former to have stri ated elytra without elevated lines The splendens has only three ele vated lines on the elytra and the decora is larger with the tip of the elytra twotoothed Neither can it be the striata Oliv as the elytra are not slightly bidentate nor are their two inner elevated lines abbre viated A variety found by my brother B Say in New Jersey is much tinted with copper and is smaller but the sculpture and form are the same I may add as closely allied to the impedita andto the salisburiensis Web in point of colouring a specimen which I found in New Jersey many years since and which I then described under the name of ul tramarina but the description was mislaid and never published and the specimnen is now deprived of its head and thorax The following is a description of what remains of it  Dr Harris is of opinion that this species the aurulenta of Linneus and Olivier and the striata of Fabricius are the same and that the decora F and salisburiensis Weber and Herbst are identical Tlle latter differ from the aurulenta L in not having elevated lines on the elytraSOME NORTH AMERICAN INSECTS 161 Scute orbicular disk indented elytra blue on the disc submargin anid subsuture green passing into golden

twofifths of an inch It is more brilliant than either the impedita or salisburiensis From the former it is distinguished by being destitute of elevated lines oni the elytra and from both by its regular series of large profound punctures 14 B viridicornis Nob This has been mistaken by an European entomologist for the agrilus ruficollis F but it is very different in form which is much nmore like that of a true Buprestis and the colour is also different though that of the head and thorax probably deceived him being coppery in each though much more obscure in our insect I have taken a variety in this state differing greatly in colour so much so that it might lead to error unless actually compared The colour is bright green thorax on the disc tinged with coppery with a common green triangle extending from the humerus to beyond the middle beneath the green colour is less brilliant Another variety has the cupreous colour of the thorax confined to the lateral margin the remainder being of the colour of the elytra I may add to the specific description that the head has an orbicular indentation between the eyes and a slightly indented line on the ver tex the scutel is altogether destitute of a transverse elevated line it is convex and widely triangular the elytra are minutely serrate at tip This species has characters in common with buprestis and agrilus and it may perhaps belong to the latter AGRILUS Megerle 1 A ruficollis F We may add to the Fabrician characters that the head is profoundly indented on the vertex the indented line is continued down the front the elytra are scabrous and at tip as well as that of the abdomen serrate Var i Thorax obscure green162 DESCRIPTIONS OF AND OBSERVATIONS ON Var B Thorax colour of the elytra The great indentation of the vertex distinguishes this species from others of this country Llerbsts figure Only tends to mislead if indeed it can be intended for this insect at all It is too robust the thorax is not represented as indented and the elytra are punctured in striae with large punctures 2 A geminatus Nob A nunmerous species the colour of the head and thorax oftern resemnbling those of the preceding species but the acute arcuated elevated line at the posterior angles is similar to that of the linearis F of Austria which it very much resembles 3 A politus Nob Much like arcuatus but a little more robust and of a brilliant colour Like the other species its elytra are denti culated at tip Having examined numnerous specimens I find that it is not of a larger size thani geminatus 4 A arcuatus Nob A little larger than geminatus and resem bling it in the character of the elevated line at the posterior thoracic angles but the antenne are much more slender and elongated 5 A granulatus Nob This species has three hiardly visible ful vous spots on the elytra one on the depressed base onie near the suture before the middle and one behind the middle also near the suture I have a specimen in which these spots are not at all visible The elevated line at the posterior angles of the thorax is short but very obvious 6 A bilineatus Weber Nob In my printed description an error occurs When describing the elytral vitte instead of Cextended to wards the tip where it gradually approaches the scutel I should have said suture instead of Cscutel 7 A lateralis Nob I stated in the description that the elytra are entire I would add that they are not obviously denticulated at tip 8 Apusillus Nob The smallest North American species I have yet seen The above species of agrilus excepting the first I described in the Journal Acad Nat Sc and the Annals of the Lyceum of Nat Hist of New York under the genus Buprestis to which most entomologists yet refer their kindred speciesSOME NORTH AMERICAN INSECTS 163 9

describing the elytra is elytra striata atra margine baseos la teralique late albo  but as the whitish portion occupies about two thirds of the whole surface and might lead to error it would be better to say elytra whitish with the sutural margin and exterior edge except ing at base black I change the Fabrician name because it is preoccupied by Weber for a very different species of this country 2 E morio F Herbst E hevigatus F Herbst E piceus De geer Turtons Linn  Dr Harris says that Webers species here referred to is the hematus of Fabricius and that Mr Say does not seem to have known the Elater discoideus of Fabricius which is quite distinct from the above named oblessus166 DESCRIPTIONS OF AND OBSERVATIONS ON This species is subject to vary through all the intermediate grada tions

rufous feet rufous pectus distinctly canalicuilate each side of the middleLength thieetwen tieths of an inch NoteI am indebted to Count Mannerheim of St Petersburg Rus sia for his excellent observations on this genus His descriptions are detailed and perspicuous I have adopted for the present his views of this genus THROSCUS Latr T constrictor This species is the approximate analogue of the adstrictor Fabr of Europe to which I had always referred it but on comparing our in sect with a specimen of the adstrictor for which I am indebted to the politeness of Professor Germar I am inclined to consider it a distinct species and I give to it the above name which that distinguished ento mologist proposes in his letter This insect compared with the ad strictor is of a paler colour and a little different in form  being less attenuated behind in size it is much the same it is also somewhat more obviously punctured

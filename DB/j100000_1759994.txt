with their remains This ninth volume of the reports of the census taken in 1880 now before us tells us what these forests are First and briefly as to their general distribu tion in accordance with the climate and con figuration of the country There is in the most general terms a forest of the Atlantic and another of the Pacific region widely separated through a long stretch of the continent more approximate at their northern extremities and essentially but loosely joined along the Mexican borders from Texas to southern California by a very peculiar arboreal vegetation And even where the Atlantic and Pacific woods are most widely severed as in about latitude 40 the western own to a near relationship with the eastern along the line where the Rocky Mountains flank the plains Together the two compose one large whole  a temperate North American sylva the harmony of which is not greatly disturbed by the intrusion of Mexi can types into its southern borders A more seriously discordant element however insig nificant geographically but figuring rather prominently in the catalogue comes as a con sequence of the southward extension of the peninsula of Florida upon which a good num ber of tropical WestIndian trees have effected a lodgment Like other immigrants these denizens must be received upon the same foot ing with those more truly to the manner born although they sensibly impair the homogeneity of the United States sylva Next as to the genera and species of which our forests are composed amounting it ap pears to a hundred and fiftyeight genera and four hundred and twelve species A con siderable number of these however are only arborescent at their best never attaining the magnitude of timbertrees and fortyeight of the genera and nearly sixty species occur only in semitropical Florida The systematic account of the trees fills two hundred and twenty pages of the volume It is wonderfully full not to say exhaustive in the bibliography and synonymy is comprehensive as to geo graphical ranges particular in its statement of the character of the wood the specific gravity and the amount of ashes being specified under Report on the forests of North America exclusive of Mfexico By CHARLES S SARGENT Arnold professor of arboriculture in Hlarvard college special agent tenth census Washington Gov ernment 1884 612 p 4 39 colored maps 4 and f with port folio of 16 maps eleph f3 VOL V No 105 each species and also its economical uses But descriptive matters and all botanical details beyond a mention of the height at tained by the tree are scrufpulously omitted Even the nature and appearance of the bark characteristic as it generally is and sometimes very important in its practical applications is nowhere mentioned except in a single line in a single case that of the canoe birch Even the difference between the cherry birch and the yellow birch so striking in the bark and so slight in every other respect is not alluded to This is evidently done on principle It was necessary to draw the line somewhere and Professor Sargent has drawn it very taught We should grieve inconsolably over the ex clusion except for our expectation that the author means to make amends in another work in which the tree will stand for more than its timber Let us note in passing that in any future publication  Palmaceae  should give place to  Palmae It was a good thought to supply a separate and full index to the  Cata logue of foresttrees as this part of the vol ume is modestly entitled The addition of as much descriptive botanical matter as there is of bibliography would have made of it a com pendious treatise We will not complain that practical matters predominate in a census report Part ii  The woods of the United States fills two hundred and forty pages most of it tabular matter Woods are here used in the sense of timbers and this portion of the volume records with much completeness the result of an exhaustive determination of the specific gravity the amount of ash the weight per cubic foot the tensile strength the behavior under compression and the fuel value of the wood of all the species This great piece of work was done by or under the direction of Mr S P Sharples The wood specimens are preserved in two full series one in the National museum at Wash ington one in that of the arboretum of lar vard university and the surplus material worked into 12961 museum specimens has been made into sixty sets and distributed to nearly as many educational institutions Any one wishing to know the relative specific gravity of the wood of our trees has only to consult the table beginning on p 249 He will learn that all those which are heavier than water are of semitropical species or of the arid southwestern interior region that the Floridian Condalia ferrea leads the list spe cific gravity 13020  that Cercocarpus ledi folius the mountain mahogany of Utah etc comes up to 10731  that the lightest coniferS CIENCE ous wood is of the big tree Sequoia gigantea 02882 and that the lightest wood of all is of a fig in Florida Ficus aurea 02616 Upon part iii The forests of the United States in their economic aspects which con cludes the volume and which the fine colored maps graphically illustrate Professor Sargent has bestowed great pains and to much purpose The statistics of the lumber industry for the census year the table of forestfires during that year the map showing the proportion of wood land within the settled area burned over in that year and the map showing the character of the fuel used in different parts of the settled portion of the country are most interesting and instructive Not less so are the detailed and fully illustrated summaries of the present condition and character of the woodlands of every state and territory The principles of forest preservation the needs of the country in this respect and its importance in certain listricts also the special need as well as great difficulty of guarding against forestfires are touched upon as occa sion serves If the country suffers hereafter it will not be from the lack of good advice Possibly the forest report for the eleventh cen sus may show that it has not all been wasted If the forest agent for 1890 brings out a more valuable report than that of 1880 it will in a measure be due to the advantages furnished by the work of his predecessor SCHELLENS DYNAMOELECTRIC MA CHINES Tins is a translation from the third German edition with large additions and notes relating to American macltines by Mr Keith In the first two editions of the original the work ap peared in one volume but in the third the author thought it desirable to divide it into two and in this the translators have followed hirnm The first volume only is now published and is principally devoted to methods and machines for producing electric currents It is not easy to keep pace with the produc tion of dynamoelectric literature at present and one cannot avoid the conclusion that much of it might be suppressed without really serious loss Books on dynamoelectric machinery may be prepared for the general intelligent public for the socalled  practical electrician sJagneto and dynamo electric machines By Dr H SCHEr IEN Vol i Translated from the third German edition by N S Keith and Percy Neymann New York Van Nostrand 1884 518 p 8 117 or for the student of electrical engineering Dr Schellens book is not likely to satisfy the demands of either of these classes About a hundred pages bear the general title of  Preliminary physics Forty of these are occupied by the development of the funda mental idea of the production of electricity by induction which is accomplished in a manner not differing greatly from that of other similar treatises The remainder contains the con sideration of methods of electric measurements and measuring instruments Including as it does dynamometric photometric and electric measurement proper this comes near being the most unsatisfactory portion of the book Tlhe great importance of thoroughly understanding this part of the subject is strongly emphasized but the reader will seek in vain for its satis factory elucidation The study of dynamome ters is by far the best of this part and the translators have shown wisdom in inserting full descriptions of the Kent dynamometer prepared by Dr Henry Morton and of the Brackett dynarnometer prepared by Professor Brackett its inventor Under electric meas urement little is to be found aside from the description of a few of the coarser devices for determining electromotive force and current strength and there is really nothing concern ing methods of measurement Although the book is of very recent date the units of measure are not defined in accordance with the agreement of the international electrical con gress  and in the discussion of photometric standards no mention whatever is made of that adopted by that body  Intensity  for current or current strength and  tension  for electromotive force are found unfortunately throughout the work The bulk of the volume is devoted to descrip tions of magneto and dynamo electric machines in great variety These are generally given in considerable detail accompanied by diagrams and plates Many of the descriptions are very satisfactory although most of them have ap peared already in similar publications The concluding chapter contains a brief discussion of the theory of dynamoelectric machines and a classification of dynamos The discussion of the theory would be greatly improved by expansion and the classification of dynamos would be more useful to the reader if introduced before the description of machines An appendix contains a number of tables of considerable practical value and an attempt to define the  absolute or c G s system of units of measure In a previous chapter the necessity of being thoroughly fa FEBRUAIRY 6 1885

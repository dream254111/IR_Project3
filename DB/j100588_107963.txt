the Site and Origin of Grahanz Island By Captain W H SMYTH RN FRS FSA Read February 9 1832 IN consequence of accounts recently published concerning the rise and pro gress of this island which I conceive to have been stated materially in error and in order that physical inquiry may receive as exact data as can be afforded I beg leave to offer the following remarks to the Royal Society It was stated in the first letters which arrived from Malta that an officer on the Mediterranean station was in possession of an old chart whereon was a shoal with only four fathoms on it and called Larmours Breakers and this being asserted to be  within a mile of the latitude and longitude of the new island was consequently announced as its nucleus On reading some of these letters I saw at once that the chart was mistaken for a valuable docu ment but being aware that its particulars were well known to navigators I should not have deemed it to require notice had not the erroneous inference been repeated both in the Journal of the Geographical Society and in the Quarterly Review The danger alluded to as existing upon the old chart was never ascer tained or verified it was only thought to have been seen by Captain LARMOUR when in command of the Wassanaer a troopship on the Egyptian expedition But the same impression did not strike all the officers and passengers and on the commanderinchief dispatching two or three vessels to examine it for a more detailed report no shoalwater could be found The present Captain RICHARD SPENCER CB then a lieutenant on board the Wassanaer was one of the officers sent to assist in the search  and from him I had these particulars Yet the minute which had been forwarded to me from the Admiralty being written in these decided terms 2L2CAPTAIN SMYTH ON AN ERROR RESPECTING H M Ship Wassanaer 11th of December 1800 P M The island of Pantellaria SW by W 9 or 10 leagues saw a reef of rocks SSE distant 3 or 4 miles extending NNW and SSE about one mile in length Hauled up S by W to clear them Saw something on the reef like a ships mast Bearings by compass I examined the spot with a rigorous strictness see Plate VII  and froIn the various traverses which I made in every direction with the lead going by night and by day I feel prepared to assert that no reef of the nature described by Captain LARMOUR in 1800 and no shoal of four fathoms water could have existed in 1814 How the said four fathoms crept into our charts is best known to the shipchandlers who too long purveyed to the scientific wants of seamen but from the absence of positive testimony from the careful search made by order of Lord KEITH from my own several cruizes and from the ma terial fact of its being in the high road which is annually beaten by hundreds of ships it is not presuming greatly to say that neither the one nor the other had any existence Nor is the assigned place within a mile of the position of the volcanic islet though it may accidentally have been so marked upon the seacards  for it should be remembered that the true site even of the principal headlands around was not then decided According to the minute just quoted corrected for magnetic variation LARMOUIS supposed reef is no less than sixteen miles W by N from it on a part of the subaqueous plateau which I named Ad venture Bank uniting Sicily to Africa by a succession of ridgesabout a spot where I found from 40 to 50 fathoms of water Grahams Isle however is not upon this bank it arose between it and a knoll some miles to the east ward which from a shell brought up by the arming I called Nerita and if the observations which determine the latitude and longitude of the stranger as in 37 08 25 N and 12 43 50 E be correct it must have been elevated through more than a hundred fathoms of water In thus doubting the actual existence of the Larmour Shoal it is not my intention to dispute the appearance and disappearance of natural phenomena nor that stupendous alterations may occur by the subsidence and uplifting of stratabecause an obstinate scepticism would be absurd especially in a part of the globe where to use a wellexpressed Italian metaphor the whole ground 256lz a

and proper to question such ru mours as have been made without due examination In the instance before us no endeavour was made to establish the truth by either shortening sail lowering a boat or even getting a cast of the lead moreover they were three or four miles from the supposed object and opinions on board the Wassanaer were not at all unanimous By similar indecision a teasing knot of perils has gained randomt insertion upon our charts to the disquietude of sea comniand ers but it is a fault which is fast disappearing and it may be trusted that there are few officers who would not think themselves liable to the imputation of culpable carelessness did they not seek to verify such  dangers as they might accidentally encounter I do not think subaqueous volcanic explosions are of such rare occurrence as is generally supposed  and extremely sudden intumescence may arise from the expansion of an inferior lava bed It is not at all improbable that gaseous fluids and ejectamenta may have been seen before the accumulation of solid matter protruded from the vent was sufficient to form a crater of eruption A volcanic apex may become visible and again be quickly destroyed by tritu ration the solution of mineral substances and the repressive force of the co lumn of water over the vent Now as there was a chance that something of the kind had occurred in the neighbourhood assigned to Larmours reef breakers having been reported near the same spot by the Greyhound frigate and shoals having been immemorially marked there under the names of La Ajuga and B ScoglioI laboriously explored the whole vicinity In exam ining the chart which resulted from this undertaking it will be found that a knoll with only seven fathoms upon it was discovered not far from the site of all these reports and that the Adventure Bank extends from Sicily nearly to Pantellaria where the water deepens at once from 76 fathoms to no bottom with 375 fathoms of line A further inspection will show that the Phlegraean islands of Pantellaria and Linosa have been protruded from the greatest depths where perhaps the fires found the least resistance All these considerations led me to suppose that though the reports were ex ceedingly vague volcanic agency might still have given grounds for them I therefore made particular inquiries both in Sicily and Pantellaria as to local earthquakes and whether any volumes of smoke ferilli or jets of flame 257258 CAPTAIN SMYTH ON THE SITE AND ORIGIN OF GRAHAM ISLAND comminuted ashes or other fragmentary ejectments had been noticed in that direction but I could hear of none Yet we are told as a  fact of weight that a tradition is current which says  A volcano existed in the same spot about the commencement of the last century It would be difficult to say how this tradition was preserved amongst a people little given to letters and I never in my long residence and systematic researches at the above place and in Malta heard the slightest hint of it I am therefore led to the conclusionfirstly that no shoal or danger has lately existed in that channel excepting only an occasional overfall in very heavy weather on the 7 fathom knoll where I anchored H M ship Adventure and which is sufficiently near for bearings taken at random and without suspicion of the existence of local attraction to be placed in identity with the reports above mentioned Secondly that even if what Captain LARMOUR became persuaded he saw was actually a temporary volcanic effect it had no possible relation to breakers with four fathoms upon them And it follows that the assertion of Graham Island having been formed by the mere  lifting up of such shoal must be utterly destitute of foundation

upon the HiEmalayan slopes near the Bay of Bengal remains the wettest spot on the globe It is reported that during one month August the rainfall ineas ured 384 inches and it is believed that the annual precipitation is over 600 inches A NEW WEATIHER SIGNAL SINCE December 1 a new marine signal con sisting of a red pennant has been displayed by the United States Weather Bureau to signify the approach of high winds which would not justify the issue of the regular storm warning It is known as the small craft warning as it is designed especially for the owners of fishing towing motor and yachting craft The pennant is flown from the officially designated flagstaffs on the At lantic Pacific and Gulf coasts as well as along the borders of the Great Lakes Judg ing from recent press reports the innovation is proving of value to those for whom it was intended CONCERNING AVIATION FATALITIES AMONG the suggestions which have been offered to explain various fatal accidents in aviation recently is that which one aviator de scribes as  ethereal asphyxia a dreadful something which lurks in the upper air and creeps irresistibly upon the senses of the aviator lulling him into a dreamy uncon sciousness He declared that it was not due to rarefied atmosphere as there was no stifling choking or pain in the eardrums such as often results from decreased pressure The falsity of the explanation is apparent to any one who considers the matter for aeronauts have for more than a century ascended to far greater heights than the aeroplane has yet reached and no  mysterious gas  has been reported Soundings of the free air have es tablished the fact that up to the greatest height attained by an aeroplane about two miles the composition of the atmosphere is sensibly the same as at the ground How ever some of the fatalities occurring can not be explained by mechanical defects gusts of wind or airholes Might not the  ethereal asphyxia be similar to the drowsiness ex perienced by certain people in windy weather Persons who have climbed to the summits of high hills or mountains often express a desire to lie down and sleep Moreover the cold aloft is another factor to be considered One travel ing in a balloon experiences a perfect calm about him and thus is not greatly affected by the low temperatures But every one who has sat in the front seat of a rapidly moving auto mobile on which there was no windshield can readily imagine how chilling must be the air encountered by an aviator traveling against the wind Even in midsummer temperatures below freezing are met at a height of two miles and such air brushing past the aviator at a rate of a mile a minute might soon cause temporary paralysis of the limbs resulting in a loss of control of the craft The heaviest clothing yet worn by an aviator could hardly give him the protection needed Accelerated heartaction nervous tension fatigue and other factors doubtless contribute to the avia tors distress The problem is not wholly a meteorological one ANDREW H PALMER BLUE HILL OBSERVATORY February 1 1912 SPECIAL ARTICLES ON THE ORIGIN OF AN ALBINO RACE OF DEER MOUSE THE first case of Mendelian inheritance shown to exist among animals was that of total albinism in mice In this condition the fur is snowwhite and the eyes are pink they like the fur being entirely devoid of skinpig ment For the pink color of the eyes is due to the blood seen through the transparent eye it disappears at death The ordinary white mouse is an albino va riety of the common house mouse with which it crosses readily Crossbred offspring F are never white but like the wild parent in color But in the next generation F2 part of the offspring are albinos On the average one fourth are albinos and these breed true in accordance with Mendels law 346 SCIENCESCIENCE The time and place of origin of the common white mouse is entirely unknown the same is true of nearly all distinct varieties of animals either domesticated or wild Peculiar inter est therefore attaches to a case in which an albino race has arisen from a wild species Such a case I will now briefly describe The native field mouse of North America is known by several different common names such as deer mouse field mouse whitefooted mouse and wood mouse Systematic zoologists at the present time give it the generic name Peromyscus The most recent and exhaust ive study of this genus is that of Osgood1 1909 who after examining over 27000 specimens from all the great collections of America and all other available sources  con servatively recognizes 157 distinct species and subspecies In the light of this exhaustive study it seems probable that Peromyscus is the most abundant and the most widely distributed of North American mammals as well as one of the most carefully studied from the systematic standpoint Nevertheless an albino specimen has never up to the present time been re ported which would seem to indicate that its occurrence is very rare In the fall of 1909 Mr K S Clark caught in the woods near St Johns Clinton County Michigan a pure white albino Peromyscus This he kept alive for some weeks and then delivered it to Professor Walter B Barrows of the Michigan Agricultural College where Mr Clark was a student Fortunately neither Mr Clark nor Professor Barrows obeyed the common impulse straightway to make a museum specimen of the rare individ ual They tended this unique animal with great care Later through the kindly interest of Professor W M Barrows of Ohio State University who was engaged with me in breeding experiments with Peromyscus the albino was sent to me I received it in Feb Osgood Wilfred H Revision of the Mice of the American Genus Peromyscus Publication of U S Department of Agriculture Bureau of Bio logical Survey N A Fauna No 28 285 pp 8 pls Washington 1909 347 ruary 1911 and kept it alive at my house or at the Bussey Institution until January 29 1912 when it died probably from extreme cold In March 1911 Mr Clark trapped a dozen other Peromyscus near the place where he had caught the albino the previous fall and sent these to me All were normal in appearance and referable to Peromyscus leucopus nove boracensis Fischer as described by Osgood Two of the females were successfully mated with the albino which proved to be a male During the summer and fall of 1911 they pro duced 6 litters of young including 28 individ uals all normal in appearance like the mothers One of the daughters was mated with the albino father in October 1911 On November 21 she bore a litter of three young an albino and two ordinary young but all were eaten the following night Three weeks later she bore a litter of four young two being albinos and two normal The albinos were successfully reared but no more young have since been born and as this species does not breed in winter it is not probable that more will be obtained for some months The behavior of the albino variation thus far is that of a simple Mendelian recessive as in house mice guineapigs rabbits and rats The experiment has not yet progressed far ehough to show whether the albino variation has been attended by variation in any other pigment factor and so its continuation is awaited with interest In the other rodents mentioned we have not only albino varieties but also black ones lacking a ticking or agouti factor in all except rats yellow ones with a reduced amount of black and in mice and guineapigs brown ones lacking black entirely As nothing is known con cerning the origin of these variations it is uncertain whether they arose simultaneously with the albino variation or as a consequence of it or wholly independently of it As how ever we find the inheritance of these varia tions to be wholly independent of the inherit ance of albinism it seems probable that in origin also these variations were independent A case in which observation along these lines is possible is heartily welcomed MARCH 1 1912N S VOL XXXV No 89 Men who make a business of producing plant novelties Burbank for example are de lighted with the slightest indication of sport ing because they consider that the stability of the type having been disturbed other variations are likely to follow Whether there is any basis of fact for this idea cases like that here described may tend to show if carefully followed up If the sup posed phenomenon is found to be a real one and an initial color variation is frequently followed by others then it will remain to dis cover an explanation since instability of type can scarcely be regarded as an explana tion but only a figurative statement of a phe nomenon observed Studies of the inheritance of albinism as already stated show it to be independent in transmission of the several factors which de termine the particular character of the pig mentation as gray black yellow etc For in crosses with colored varieties albinos actu ally do transmit to their offspring particular qualities of pigmentation as gray black yellow etc It is assumed therefore that in the albino variation something has been lost from the organism which is indispensable to the production of pigment though it has nothing to do with controlling the particular sort of pigment which the organism can form Albinos therefore can be produced of as many different sorts as regards their breeding capacity as are the visibly different pigmented sorts Each pigmented sort finds its counter part among albinos though all these albinos may look alike A study of the progeny of an albino through two generations will serve to show with what particular colored variety it corresponds Such a study has not yet been completed for the albino Peromyscus The albino variation being a loss variation and recessive in nature must have existed in both the gametes the egg and the sperm which produced the individual captured by Mr Clark Both the parents of that individ ual accordingly transmitted albinism and probably produced other albino young if they had more than a single litter of offspring But the survival of albino offspring in the wild state would be exceedingly doubtful because of their conspicuousness and their defective vision Yet the heterozygous brothers and sisters of the albino sports should themselves be at no disadvantage in the struggle for ex istence and should produce about 25 per cent of albino young Therefore we should not be surprised if the sporadic occurrence of al binism should continue in a locality where it has once made its appearance as in Clinton County Michigan The naturalists of that region would perform a service to science by looking for and reporting future occurrences of albinism in field mice there In conclusion I wish to express my grati tude to Professor Barrows father and son for entrusting to me the experimental study of this interesting variation W E CASTLE LABORATORY OF GENETICS BUSSEY INSTITUTION FOREST HILLS MASS February 7 1912 ORIGIN OF THE SEDIMENTS AND COLORING MATTER OF THE RED BEDS OF OKLAHOMA1 SINCE the origin of the sediments and the red coloration of the Oklahoma red beds has long been the object of more than ordinary curiosity it may not be out of place to briefly outline some of the results of a recent study of these deposits Previous workers have made known the fact that the lightcolored sediments of the lower Permian rocks of Kansas become red in Okla homa and that the similar lightcolored Al bany beds of Texas redden on approaching Oklahoma In the Texas reports Cummins hinted that a lateral transition of the Albany beds into the red rocks of the Wichita forma tion might not be impossible Later he worked out this transition in detail2 Gould and Published with the permission of the director of the Oklahoma

NERVES FIRST DISCOVERED BY FALLO PIUS ARE OBLONG AND VERY HARD BODIES THE USES OF WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN SATISFACTORILY ASCERTAINED BY ANY ONE FEW ANATOMISTS HAVE INDEED ENTERED DEEP INTO THE SUBJECT EXCEPT THE LEARNED J M LANCISI WHO IMAGINED THEM MUSCLES SUI GENERIS AND LIKE OTHER MUSCLES CAPABLE OF CONTRACTIONS BY WHICH HE THOUGHT THE NERVOUS SPIRITS WERE ACCLERATED AND IMPELLED WITH SUCH ADDITIONAL FORCES AS ARE BY HIM SUPPOSED NECESSARY TO THE PRODUCTION OF MOTIONS IN MUSCLES SUBJECT TO THE WILL AND IN ORDER TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THE STRUCTURE OF ALL OTHER GANGLIONS HE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES AND DELINEATES THAT OF THE FIRST CERVICAL GANGLION A READ MAY 31 1764 THIS THEORY HAS THE MISFORTUNE TO BE ERRONEOUS IN ITS FOUNDATION FOR HALLER AND OTHER SUCCEEDING ANATOMISTS HAVE NOT

HYPOTHESIS NOT TO OBSERVE THIS STRIKING CIRCUMSTANCE THE THEORY WHICH PREVAILED IN HIS TIME AND COUN TRY OF THE ACTION OF THE DURA MATER UPON THE BRAIN NOW EXPLODED MIGHT LEAD THIS GREAT MAN MORE EN TIRELY TO BELIEVE AN ANALOGOUS MUSCULAR POWER IN GANGLIONS BUT THE BRAIN NEEDS NO MUSCULAR FORCE TO IMPRESS MOTION UPON THE ANIMAL SPIRITS AND GRANTING GANGLIONS TO BE AS IS INGENIOUSLY CONJEC TURED

SUPPOSES THE FORCE OF MUSCLES OF THE GREATEST EX ERTION AND EFFECT TO BE DERIVED FROM THOSE OF LEAST BULK AND STRENGTH WHICH MUST BE IN SOME PROPOR TION TO THE QUANTITY OF MUSCULAR FIBRES AND WOULD BE

OBSERVED NO MECHANISM WHICH THESE PARTS HAVE MORE THAN THOSE MUSCLES WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE DIRECTION OF THE WILL MAY WE NOT THEN REASONABLY CONCLUDE THAT GANG LIONS ARE THE INSTRUMENTS BY WHICH THE MOTIONS OF THE HEART AND INTESTINES ARE FROM THE EARLIEST TO THE LAST PERIODS OF ANIMAL LIFE RENDERED UNIFORMLY INVO LUNTARY AND THAT TO ANSWER THIS PURPOSE IS THEIR USE WHICH THEY SUBSERVE BY A STRUCTURE UNKNOWN TO US NO LESS THAN THAT OF THE BRAIN THOUGH IT SEEMS NOT IMPROBABLE THE FIRST MAY BE ANALOGOUS TO THE LAST THIS CONCLUSION CONCERNING THE USE OF GANGLIONS IS SUPPORTED BY EVERY TRULY PARALLEL INSTANCE THUS THE MOTIONS OF THE UVEA OR MUSCULAR CIRCLE OF THE EYE EVER CONTRACTED OR DILATED AS THE EYE IS MORE OR LESS IRRADIATED WITH LIGHT ARE AS MUCH INVOLUNTARY AS THOSE OF THE HEART

ARE AS IT WERE INTERCEPTED AND PREVENTED FROM REACHING CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BODY BY THE MEANS OF GANGLIONS MAY BE FARTHER INFERRED BY CONSIDERING THAT ALL NERVES WHICH HAVE A READY COMMUNICATION WITH THE SOUL EITHER BY AFFECTING IT WITH PERCEPTIONS OR CONVEYING ITS COMMANDS HAVE NO GANGLIONS THESE ARE NEVER FOUND UPON THE OLFACTORY OPTIC OR AUDITORY NERVES ANY MORE THAN UPON THE NERVES AND INSTRUMENTS IN VOLUNTARY MOTION FOR WE MAY WELL IMAGINE THE SAME MECHANISM WHICH PREVENTS THE WILL FROM EX TENDING ITS CONTROUL TO SOME MUSCLES PLACED UPON A SENSORY NERVE WOULD HAVE EQUALLY HINDERED THE CON VEYANCE OF ANY SENSIBLE IMPRESSION TO THE MIND THE LEFT NERVE OF THE EIGHTH PAIR DISTRIBUTED TO THE STOMACH AND PROBABLY THE CAUSE OF THE DISTINCT AND EXQUISITE SENSATION OF THAT ORGAN AND PERHAPS ALSO PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED IN TRANSMITTING THE SENSE OF HUNGER TO THE MIND MAY THEREFORE BE RECKONED A SEN SORY NERVE IT IS CERTAIN ALSO THAT HALLER I AND MOST MODERN ANATOMISTS DO NOT ALLOW ANY GANGLION TO THIS NERVE THOUGH WINSLOW DOES AND VIEUSSENS DELINEATES ONE NOT FAR FROM THE GREAT GANGLION OF THE INTERCOS TAL NERVE AS PROPER TO THE EIGHT PAIR IF MUSCLES SUBJECT TO THE WILL MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO TALLY SUPPLIED WITH NERVES WHICH HAVE GANGLIONS THE DIAPHRAGM HAD PROBABLY BEEN ENTIRELY FURNISHED FROM THE INTERCOSTALS AS MOST OF THE PARTS IN THE THORAX ABOVE IT AND IN THE ABDOMEN BELOW IT ARE BUT AS THE MOTIONS OF THIS MUSCULAR MEMBRANE WERE TO BE I A HALLER PRIMAE LIN PHYSIOLOG NO 377 CONTROULABLE183 CONTROULABLE BY THE WILL WE FIND PECULIAR NERVES NAMELY THE PHRENIC WHICH HAVE NO GANGLIONS SENT TO IT FROM A GREAT DISTANCE IN PROPOSING THIS AS THE PROBABLE USE OF GANGLI ONS I AM FAR FROM THINKING IT ENTIRELY EXEMPT FROM DIFFICULTIES BUT THEY ARE CHIEFLY SUCH AS ARISE FROM OUR IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE NERVES IN GENERAL A TERRA INCOGNITA WHICH REMAINS TO IMMORTALIZE THE NAME OF SOME FUTURE DISCOVERER IN ANATOMY IT IS WELL KNOWN FOR INSTANCE THAT ALL THE NERVES SENT FROM THE SPINAL MARROW HAVE GANGLIONS WHERE THEY SEND OFF THE BRANCH WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE INTER COSTALS K THOUGH THIS BE TRUE IT IS MOST PROBABLE THAT THESE GANGLIONS RESPECT THE INTERCOSTALS AND ONLY AFFECT ITS NERVES LEAVING THE OTHER FIBRES FIT AND FREE FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF THE COMMANDS OF THE WILL AS IN FACT MANY OF THEM ARE DISTRIBUTED TO MUSCLES UNDER ITS POWER AND DIRECTION SO LIKEWISE WE ARE NOT TO IMAGINE WHEREVER THE NERVES UNITE THAT THEIR MEDULLARY SUBSTANCE EITHER DE CUSSATES OR IS SO INTIMATELY MIXED AS IS REASONABLY SUP POSED TO BE THE CASE IN GANGLIONS BY MOST ANATOMISTS FROM LANCISI DOWN TO HALLER WE KNOW AT LEAST THAT THIS IS FAR FROM BEING THE CASE IN THE OPTIC NERVES FOR THOUGH THEY UNITE AND WERE SUPPOSED TO CROSS EACH OTHER THE CONTRARY

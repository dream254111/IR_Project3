both The principal case seems very doubtful and cer tainly extends the doctrine to its extreme limit CONTRACTSPARTIAL PERFORMANCEQUANTUM MERUITThe plaintiff contracted to drive a well for the defendant but failed to fully and sub stantially perform the contract The defendant having accepted the in complete work the plaintiff sued to recover on a quantum meruit for services actually performed Held the plaintiff can recover Hartwell v Turner Ala 71 Scath 658 The principles laid down by the courts in cases of this kind are varied and irreconcilable That there can be no recovery on the contract is generally conceded but there is a conflict as to the right of recovery on a quantum meruit for the value of services actually performed Some courts deny the plaintiffs right to recover on a quantum meruit while others hold that he may recover and others give a qualified an swer varying accordingly as the contract is general or special or whether the abandonment of the plaintiff was or was not willful Thus a ma jority of the older cases hold that where the contract is entire that the plaintiff must stand by the contract and when the abandonment is due to failure on his part he should not recover even for the labor ac tually performed McMillan v Vanderlip 12 Johns N Y 165 7 Am Dec 299 Stark v Parker 2 Pick Mass 267 13 Am Dec 425 Jennings v Camp 13 Johns N Y 94 7 Am Dec 367 The majority of the Eng lish decisions follow the same doctrine Waddington v Oliver 2 Bos  Pul N R 61 Ellis v Hamlen 3 Taunt 52 Cutter v Powell 6 Term R 320 That such a rule in its operation may be very unjust is ap parent and this doctrine emphasizing the technical unity and en tirety of contracts is not favored by many of the modern courts which hold that the plaintiff may recover on a quantum meruit the reasonable value of services actually rendered Britton v Turner 6 N H 481 26 Am Dec 713 McClay v Hedge 18 Iowa 66 Hillyard v Crabtrees Admr 11 Tex 264 62 Am Dec 475 McDonough v Evans Marble Co 50 C C A 403 112 Fed 634 Watson v Kirby 112 Ala 436 20 South 624 Some courts refuse recovery on a quantumtt meruit when the contract is a spe cial one See Taft v Montague 14 Mass 282 7 Am Dec 215 And some cases hold that where one willfully defaults in the substantial perform ance of an entire contract he cannot recover for part performance though the other party he not damaged by the default Hartmnan v Meighan 171 Pa 46 33 Atl 123 Kohn v Fendel 29 Minn 470 13 N W 904 It would seem though the weight of authority now appears to be against it that the employee should recover without qualification for the services he actually rendered He recovers for benefits conferred upon the employer who should not be allowed to enjoy such benefits without paying their reasonable worth Nor does such a doctrine con travene public policy because the employee can gain nothing from the breach of his contract and such a breach imposes upon him all losses occasioned thereby And the fullest remedy

defend ant negligently failed to deliver a coffin ordered by the plaintiff in time for the burial Full compensation was made for the pecuniary loss oc casioned by the delay and this suit is brought to recover for the mental anguish caused the plaintiff Held there can be no recovery Southern Express Co v Byers 36 Sup Ct Rep 410 There has been much confusion and uncertainty in the decisions as to whether one can recover for the mental anguish occasioned by the breach of a contract It has been held that mental anguish is not a proper element of damages in such cases Beaulieu v Great Northern R 103 Minn 47 114 N W 353 19 L R A N S 564 Where one is ad vised of the importance of a contract and the damages which will result from its breach such resulting damages are recoverable Hadley v Bax endale 9 Exch 341 It would seem tofollow that where the contract is of such a nature that mental suffering would naturally result from its breach the mental suffering would constitute a proper element of dam ages Cumberland T  T Co v Quigley 129 Ky 788 112 S W 897 19 L R A N S 575 When other than pecuniary benefits are contracted for other than pecuniary standards should be applied in ascertaining the damages resulting from the breach See Wadsworth v W U Tel Co 86 Tenn 695 8 S W 574 And even those courts which deny the right to recover for mental anguish recognize a supposed exception to the rule in the case of a breach of promise of marriage which naturally results in some injury to the feelings and which is an action sounding in tort Coolidge v Neat 129 Mass 146 And it has been held that one can recover for the mental anguish occasioned by the delay in the trans portation of a corpse Hale v Bonner 82 Tex 33 17 S W 605 14 L R A 336 27 Am St Rep 850 The point involved in the principal case has been most frequently dis cussed in cases where there was a failure to promptly deliver a telegram announcing the death or sickness of a near relative The courts are sharply divided on the right of one to recover for the mental suffering occasioned by such delaythe federal courts and a majority of the state courts deny any such right IV U Tel Co v Chotcau 28 Okla 664 115 Pac 879 Ann Cas 1912D 824 49 L R A N S 206 These decisions are based on the ground that there can be no recovery for mental an guish at common law and chiefly on the further ground that it would be impossible to ascertain the extent of the damage thus opening the door to fraud WI U Tel Co v Choteau supra Once granting how ever that mental anguish was suffered and from the very nature of the transaction it would seem that mental suffering would be occasioned by the delay it does not seem that a recovery can be denied on the ground that the damage was uncertain There are many cases in which the law gives damages when it is impossible to ascertain with certainty the ex tent of the damage suffered e g recoveries for personal injuries Rich niond Ry  Electric Co v Garthright 92 Va 627 24 S E 267 Mental 67

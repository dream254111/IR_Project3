J100693,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16651678,101509,AN ACCOUNT OF A BOOK,I206866,ANIMADVERSIONS OF DR WALLIS UPON MRHOBSS LATE BOOK DE PRINCIPIIS  RATIOCINATIONE GEOMETRARUM THESE WERE COMMUNICATED BY WAY OF LETTERWRITTEN IN OX FORD JULY 24 1666 TO AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THE AUTHOR AS FOL LOWS SINCE I SAW YOU LAST I HAVE READ OVER MR HOBSS BOOK CONTRA GEOMETRASOR DE PRINCIPIIS  RATIOCINATIONE GEOMETRARUMWHICH YOU THEN SHEWED ME A NEW BOOK OF OLD MATTER CONTAINING BUT A REPETITION OF WHAT HE HAD BEFORE TOLD US MORE THAN ONCE AND WHICH HATH BEEN ANSWERED LONG AGOE IN WHICH THOUGH THERE BE FAULTS ENOUGH TO OFFER AMPLE MAT Q Q 2 TER290 TER FOR A LARGE CONFUTATION YET I AM SCARCE INCLINED TO BE LIEVE THAT ANY WILL BESTOW SO MUCH PAINS UPON IT FORIF THAT BE TRUE WHICH IN HIS PREFACE HE SAITH OF HIMSELF AUT SOLUS IN SANIO EGO AUT SOLUS NON INSANIO IT WOULD EITHER BE NEEDLESS OR TO NO PURPOSE FORBY HIS OWN CONFESSION ALL OTHERS IF THEY BE NOT MAD THEMSELVES OUGHT TO THINK HIM SO AND THEREFORE AS TO THEM A CONFUTATION WOULD BE NEEDLESS WHO ITS LIKE ARE WELL ENOUGH SATISFIED ALREADY AT LEAST OUT OF DANGER OF BEING SEDU CED AND AS TO HIMSELFIT WOULD BE TO NO PURPOSE FORIF HE BE THE MAD MANIT IS NOT TO BE HOPED THAT HE WILL BE CONVINCED BY REASON ORIF ALL WE BE SO WE ARE IN NO CAPACITY TO ATTEMPT IT BUT THERE IS YET ANOTHER REASON WHY I THINK IT NOT TO NEED A CONFUTATION BECAUSE WHAT IS IN ITHATH BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CON FUTED ALREADY AND SO EFFECTUALLY AS THAT HE PROFESSETH HIM SELF NOT TO HOPE THAT THIS AGE IS LIKE TO GIVE SENTENCE FOR HIM WHAT EVER NONDUM IMBUTA POSTERITAS MAY DO NOR DOTH THERE APPEAR ANY REASON WHY HE SHOULD AGAIN REPEAT IT UNLESS HE CAN HOPE THAT WHAT WAS AT FIRST FALSE MAY BY OFT REPEATING BECOME TRUE I SHALL THEREFORE INSTEAD OF A LARGE ANSWER ONELY GIVE YOU A BRIEF ACCOUNTWHAT IS IN IT WHERE IT HATH BEEN ALREADY ANSWERED THE CHIEF OF WHAT HE HATH TO SAY IN HIS FIRST 10 CHAPTERS A GAINST EUCLIDS DEFINITIONS AMOUNTS BUT TO THIS THAT HE THINKS EUCLIDE OUGHT TO HAVE ALLOWED HIS POINT SOME BIGNESS HIS LINE SOME BREADTH AND HIS SURFACESOME THICKNESS BUT WHERE IN HIS DIALOGUES PAG151152 HE SOLEMNLY UNDER TAKES TO DEMONSTRATE IT FOR IT IS THERE HIS 41TH PROPOSITION HIS DEMONSTRATION AMOUNTS TO NO MORE BUT THIS THAT UNLESS A LINE BE ALLOWED SOME LATITUDE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT HIS QUADRATURES CAN BE TRUE FOR FINDING HIMSELF REDUCED TO THESE INCONVENI ENCES 1 THAT HIS GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTIONS WOULD NOT CONSIST WITH ARITHMETICAL CALCULATIONS NOR WITH WHAT ARCHIMEDES AND OTHERS HAVE LONG SINCE DEMONSTRATED 2 THAT THE ARCH OF A CIRCLE MUST BE ALLOWED TO BE SOMETIMES SHORTER THAN ITS CHORD AND SOMETIMES LONGER THAN ITS TANGENT 3 THAT THE FAME STRAIGHT LINE MUST BE ALLOWED AT ONE PLACE ONELY TO TOUCH AND AT ANOTHER PLACE TO CUT THE SAME CIRCLE WITH OTHERS OF LIKE NATURE HE FINDES IT NECESSARY THAT THESE THINGS MAY NOT SEEM ABSURD TO ALLOW HIS LINES SOME BREADTH THAT SO AS HE SPEAKS WHILE A STAIGHT LINE WITH ITS OUTSIDE DOTH AT ONE PLACE TOUCH291 TOUCH THE CIRCLE IT MAY WITH ITS INSIDE AT ANOTHER PLACE CUT IT C BUT I SHOULD SOONER TAKE THIS TO BE A CONFUTATION OF HIS QUADRA TURES THAN A DEMONSTRATION OF THE BREADTH OF A MATHEMATICAL LINE OF WHICH SEE MY HOBBIUS HEAUTONTIMORUMENUS FROM PAG 114 TO P 1 9 AND WHAT HE NOW ADDS BEING TO THIS PURPOSE THAT THOUGH EUCLIDS  WHICH WE TRANSLATE A POINT BE NOT INDEED NO MEN QUANTI YET CANNOT THIS BE ACTUALLY REPRESENTED BY ANY THING BUT WHAT WILL HAVE SOME MAGNITUDE NOR CAN A PAINTER NO NOT APELLES HIMSELF DRAW A LINE SO SMALL BUT THAT IT WILL HAVE SOME BREADTH NOR CAN THREAD BE SPUN SO FINE BUT THAT IT WILL HAVE SOME BIGNESS PAG 231921 IS NOTHING TO THE BUSINESS FOR EUCLIDE DOTH NOT SPEAK EITHER OF SUCH POINTS OR OF SUCH LINES HE SHOULD RATHER HAVE CONSIDERED OF HIS OWN EXPEDIENE PAG 11 THAT WHEN ONE OF HIS BROAD LINES PASSING THROUGH ONE OF HIS GREAT POINTS IS SUPPOSED TO CUT ANOTHER LINE PROPO SED INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THE MIDDLE OF THE BREADTH OF THAT LINE PASSING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THAT POINT TO DISTINGUISH THE LINE GIVEN INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS AND HE SHOULD THEN HAVE CONSIDERED FURTHER THAT EUCLIDE BY A LINE MEANS NO MORE THAN WHAT MR HOBS WOULD CALL THE MIDDLE OF THE BREADTH OF HIS AND EUCLIDES POINT IS BUT THE MIDDLE OF MR HOBSS AND THEN FOR THE SAME REASON THAT MR HOBSS MIDDLE MUST BE SAID TO HAVE NO MAGNITUDE FOR ELSE NOT THE WHOLE MIDDLE BUT THE MIDDLE OF THE MIDDLE WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE AND THE WHOLE WILL NOT BE EQUAL TO ITS TWO HALVES BUT BIGGER THAN BOTH BY SO MUCH AS THE MIDDLE COMES TO EUCLIDES LINES MUST AS WELL BE SAID TO HAVE NO BREADTH AND HIS POINTS NO BIGNESS IN LIKE MANNER WHEN EUCLIDE AND OTHERS DO MAKE THE TERME OR END OF A LINE A POINT IF THIS POINT HAVE PARTS OR GREATNESS THEN NOT THE POINT BUT THE OUTERHALF OF THIS POINT ENDS THE LINE FOR THAT THE INNERHALF OF THAT POINT IS NOT AT THE END IS MANIFEST BECAUSE THE OUTERHALF IS BEYOND IT AND AGAIN IF THAT OUTER HALF HAVE PARTS ALSO NOT THIS BUT THE OUTER PART OF IT AND AGAIN THE OUTER PART OF THAT OUTER PART AND SO IN INFINITUM SO THAT AS LONG AS ANY THING OF LINE REMAINS WE ARE NOT YET AT THE END AND CONSEQUENTLY IF WE MUST HAVE PASSED THE WHOLE LENGTH BEFORE WE BE AT THE END THEN THAT END OR PUNCTUM TERMINANS HAS NOTHING OF LENGTH FOR WHEN THE WHOLE LENGTH IS PAST THERE IS NOTHING OF IT LEFT AND IF MR HOBS TELLS US AS PAG 3 THAT THIS END292 END IS NOT PUNCTUM BUT ONLY SIGNUM WHICH HE DOES ALLOW NON ESSE NOMEN QUANTI EVEN THIS WILL SERVE OUR TURN WELL ENOUGH EU CLIDS  WHICH SOME INTERPRETERS RENDER BY SIGNUM OTHERS HAVE THOUGHT FIT WITH TULLY TO CALL PUNCTUM BUT IF MR HOBS LIKE NOT THAT NAME WE WILL NOT CONTEND ABOUT IT LET IT BE PUN CTUM OR LET IT BE SIGNUM OR IF HE PLEASE HE MAY CALL IT VEXILLUM BUT THEN HE IS TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS ONLY A CONTROVERSIE IN GRAMMAR NOT IN MATHEMATICKS AND HIS BOOK SHOULD HAVE BEEN INTITULED CONTRA GRAMMATICOS NOT CONTRA GEOMETRAS NOR IS IT EU CLIDE BUT CICERO THAT IS CONCERND IN RENDRING THE GREEK  BY THE LATINE PUNCTUM NOT BY MR HOBSS SIGNUM THE MATHEMA TICIAN IS EQUALLY CONTENT WITH EITHER WORD WHAT HE SAITH HERE CHAP 8  19 AND IN HIS FIFTH DIAL P 105 C CONCERNING THE ANGLE OF CONTACT AMOUNTS BUT TO THUS MUCH THAT BY THE ANGLE OF CONTACT HE DOTH NOT MEAN EITHER WHAT EU CLIDE CALLS AN ANGLE OR ANY THING OF THAT KIND AND THEREFORE SAYS NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE OF WHAT WAS IN CONTROVERSIE BETWEEN CLAVINS AND PELETARIUS WHEN HE SAYS THAT AN ANGLE OF CONTACT HATH SOME MAGNITUDE BUT THAT BY THE ANGLE OF CONTACT HE UNDERSTANDS THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE ARCH AND IN SAYING THE ANGLE OF CONTACT HATH SOME MAGNITUDE HIS MEANING IS THAT THE ARCH OF A CIRCLE HATH SOME CROOKEDNESS OR IS A CROOKED LINE AND THAT OF EQUAL ARCHES THAT IS THE MORE CROOKED WHOSE CHORD IS SHORTEST WHICH I THINK NONE WILL DENY FOR WHO EVER DOUBTED BUT THAT A CIRCULAR ARCH IS CROOK EDOR THAT OF SUCH ARCHES EQUAL IN LENGTH THAT IS THE MORE CROOKED WHOSE ENDS BY BOWING ARE BROUGHT NEAREST TOGETHER BUT WHY THE CROOKEDNESS OF AN ARCH SHOULD BE CALLED AN ANGLE OF CONTACT I KNOW NO OTHER REASON BUT BECAUSE MR HOBS LOVES TO CALL THAT CHALK WHICH OTHERS CALL CHEESE OF THIS SEE MY HOBBINS HEAUTONTIMORU MENUS FROM PAG 88 TO P 100 WHAT HE FAITH HERE OF RATIONS OR PROPORTIONS AND THEIR CALCULUS FOR 8 CHAPTERS TOGETHER CHAP 11 C IS BUT THE SAME FOR SUBSTANCE WHAT HE HAD FORMERLY SAID IN HIS 4TH DIALOGUE AND ELSEWHERE TO WHICH YOU MAY SEE A FULL ANSWER IN MY HOBBIUS HEAUTONTIM FROM PAG 49 TO P 88 WHICH I NEED NOT HERE REPEAT ONELY AS A SPECIMEN OF MR HOBSS CANDOUR IN FALSIFICATI ONS YOU MAY BY THE WAY OBSERVE HOW HE DEALS WITH A DEMON STRATION OF MR ROOKS IN CONFUTATION OF MR HOBSS DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE WHICH WHEN HE HAD REPEATED PAG 43 HE DOTH THEN THAT IT MIGHT SEEM ABSURD CHANGE THOSE WORDS AEQUALES QUATUOR293 QUATUOR CUBIS DV PAG 43 LINE 33 INTO THESE P 44 1 5 A QUALIA QUA TUOR LINIS NEMPE QUADRUPLUS RECTAE DV AND WOULD THENCE PER SWADE YOU THAT MR ROOK HAD ASSIGNED A SOLIDE EQUAL TO A LINE BUT MR ROOKS DEMON STRATION WAS CLEAR ENOUGH FOR MR HOBSES COMMENT NOR DO I KNOW ANY MA THEMATICIAN UNLESS YOU TAKE MR HOBS TO BE ONE WHO THINKS THAT A LINE MULTIPLYED BY A NUMBER WILL MAKE A SQUARE WHAT EVER MR HOBS IS PLEASED TO TEACH US BUT THAT A NUMBER MULTIPLYED BY A NUMBER MAY MAKE A SQUARE NUMBER AND THAT A LINE DRAWN INTO A LINE MAY MAKE A SQUARE FI GURE MR HOBS IF HE WERE WHAT HE WOULD BE THOUGHT TO BE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN BEFORE NOW OR IF HE HAD NOT BEFORE KNOWN IT HE MIGHT HAVE LEARNED BY WHAT I SHEW HIM UPON A LIKE OCCASION IN MY HOB HEAUT PAG 142 143 144 HOW TO UNDERSTAND THAT LANGUAGE WITHOUT AN ABSURDITY JUST IN THE SAME MANNER HE DOTH IN THE NEXT PAGE DEAL WITH CLAVIUS FOR HAVING GIVEN US HIS WORDS PAG 45 1 3 4 DICO HANC LINEAM PERPENDICULA REM EXTRA CIRCULUM CADERE BECAUSE NEITHER INTRA CIRCULUM NOR IN PERIPHE RIA HE DOTH WHEN HE WOULD SHEW AN ERROUR FIRST MAKE ONE BY FALFIFYING HIS WORDS LINE 15 WHERE INSTEAD OF LINEAM PERPENDICULAREM HE SUBSTI TUTES PUNCTUM A ASIF EUCLIDE OR CLAVINS H D DENYED THE POINT A THE UTMOST POINT OF THE RADIUS TO BE IN THE CIRCUMFERENCE OR AS IF MR HOBS BY PROVING THE POINT A TO BE IN THE CIRCUMFERENCE HAD THEREBY PROVED THAT THE PERPENDICULAR TANGENT A E HAD ALSO LYEN IN THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE BUT THIS IS A TRADE WHICH MR HOBS DOTH DRIVE SO OFTEN AS IF HE WERE AS WELL FAULTY IN HIS MORALS AS IN HIS MATHEMATICKS THE QUADRATURE OF A CIRCLE WHICH HERE HE GIVES US CHAP 20 21 23 IS ONE OF THOSE TWELVE OF HIS WHICH IN MY HOBBIUS HEAUTONTIMORUMENUS FROM PAG 104 TO PAG 119 ARE ALREADY CONFUTED AND IS THE NINTH IN ORDER AS  THERE RANK THEM WHICH IS PARTICULARLY CONSIDERED PAG 106 107 108 I CALL IT ONE BECAUSE HE TAKES IT SO TO BE THOUGH IT MIGHT AS WELL BE CALLED TWO FOR AS THERE SO HERE IT CONSISTETH OF TWO BRANCHES WHICH ARE BOTH FALSE AND EACH OVERTHROW THE OTHER FOR IF THE ARCH OF A QUADRANT BE EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE OF THE SEMIDIAMETER AND OF THE TANGENT OF 30 DEGREES AS HE WOULD HERE HAVE IT IN CHAP 20 AND THERE IN THE CLOSE OF PROP 27 THEN IS IT NOT EQUAL TO THAT LINE WHOSE SQUARE IS EQUAL TO TEN SQUARES OF THE SEMIRADIUS AS THERE HE WOULD HAVE IT IN PROP 28 AND HERE IN CHAP 23 AND IF IT BE EQUAL TO THIS THEN NOT TO THAT FOR THIS AND THAT ARE NOT EQUAL AS I THEN DEMONSTRATED AND NEED NOT NOW REPEAT IT THE GRAND FAULT OF HIS DEMONSTRATION CHAP 30 WHEREWITH HE WOULD NOW NEWVAMP HIS OLD FALSE QUADRATURE LYES IN THOSE WORDS PAGE 40 LINE 30 31 QUOD IMPOSSIBILE EST NISI BA TRANSEAT PER C WHICH IS NO IMPOSSIBILITY AT ALL FOR THOUGH HE FIRST BID US DRAW THE LINE R C AND AFTERWARDS THE LINE R D YET BECAUSE HE HATH NO WHERE PROVED NOR IS IT TRUE THAT THESE TWO ARE THE SAME LINE THAT IS THAT THE POINT D LYES IN THE LINE R C OR THAT R C PASSETH THROUGH D HIS PROVING THAT R D CUTS OFF FROM AB A LINE EQUAL TO THE LINE OF B C DOTH NOT PROVE THAT AB PASSETH THROUGH C FOR THIS IT MAY WELL DO THOUGH AB LYE UNDER C VID IN CASE D LYE BEYOND THE LINE R C THAT IS FURTHER FROM A OR THOUGH IT LYE ABOVE C VID IN CASE D BE NEARER THAN R C TO THE POINT A AND THEREFORE UNLESS HE FIRST PROVE WHICH HE CANNOT DO THAT A D A SIXTH PART OF A D DOTH JUST REACH TO THE LINE R C AND NO FURTHER HE ONELY PROVES THAT294 THAT A SIXTH PART OF AB IS EQUAL TO THE LINE OF B C BUT WHETHER IT LYE ABOVE IT OR BELOW IT OR AS MR HOBS WOULD HAVE IT JUST UPON IT THIS ARGUMENT DOTH NOT CONCLUDE AND THEREFORE HUGENIUSS ASSERTION WHICH MR HOBS CHAT 21 WOULD HAVE GIVE WAY TO THIS DEMONSTRATION DOTH NOTWITHSTANDING THIS REMAIN SAFE ENOUGH HIS DEMONSTRATION OF CHAP 23 WHERE HE WOULD PROVE THAT THE AGGREGATE OF THE RADIUS AND OF THE TANGENT OF 30 DEGREES IS EQUAL TO A LINE WHOSE SQUARE IS EQUAL TO 10 SQUARES OF THE SEMIRADIUS IS CONFUTED NOT ONLY BY ME IN THE PLACE FORECITED WHERE THIS IS PROVED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT BY HIMSELF ALSO IN THIS SAME CHAPPAG 59 WHERE HE PROVES SUFFICIENTLY AND DOTH CONFESSE THAT THIS DEMONSTRATION AND THE 47 PROP OF THE FIRST OF EUCLIDE CANNOT BE BOTH TRUE BUT WHICH IS WORST OF ALL WHETHER EUCLIDS PROPOSITION BE FALSE OR TRUE HIS DEMONSTRATION MUST NEEDS BE FALSE I OR HE IS IN THIS DILEMMA IF THAT PROPOSITION BE TRUE HIS DEMONSTRATION IS FALSE FOR HE GRANTS THAT THEY CANNOT BE BOTH TRUE PAGE 59 LINE 21 22 AND AGAIN IF THAT PROPOSITION BE FALSE HIS DEMONSTRATION IS SO TOO FOR THIS DEPENDS UPON THATPAGE 55 LINE 22 AND THEREFORE MUST FALL WITH IT BUT THE FAULT IS OBVIOUS IN HIS DEMONSTRATION NOT IN EUCLIDS PROPOSITION THE GRAND FAULT OF IT THOUGH THERE ARE MORE LYES IN THOSE WORDS PAGE 56 LINE 26 ERIT ERGO M O MINUS QUAM M R WHEREINSTEAD OF MINUS HE SHOULD HAVE SAID MAJUS AND WHEN HE HATH MENDED THAT ERROR HE WILL FIND THAT THE MAJOR IN PAGE 56 LINE PENULT WILL VERY WELL AGREE WITH MAJOREM IN PAGE 57 LINE 1 WHERE THE PRINTER HATH ALREADY MENDED THE FAULT TO HIS HAND AND THEN THE FALSUM ERGO WILL VANISH HIS SECTION OF AN ANGLE IN RATIONE DATA CHAP 22 HATH NO OTHER FOUNDA TION THAN HIS SUPPOSED QUADRATURE OF CHAP 20 AND THEREFORE THAT BEING FALSE THIS MUST FALL WITH IT IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH THAT OF HIS 6 DIALOGUE PROP 46 WHICH BESIDES THAT IT WANTS A FOUNDATION HOW ABSURD IT IS I HAVE ALREADY SHEWED IN MY HOBBIUS HEAUTON TIMOR PAGE 119 120 HIS APPENDIX WHEREIN HE UNDERTAKES TO SHEW A METHOD OF FINDING ANY NUMBER OF MEAN PROPORTIONALS BETWEEN TWO LINES GIVEN DEPENDS UPON THE SUPPOSED TRUTH OF HIS 22 CHAPTER ABOUT DIVIDING AN ARCH IN ANY PROPORTION GIVEN AS HIMSELF PROFESSETH AND AS IS EVIDENT BY THE CONSTRUCTION WHICH SUPPOSETH SUCH A SECTION AND THEREFORE THAT FAILING THIS FALLS WITH IT AND YET THIS IS OTHERWISE FAULTY THOUGH THAT SHOULD BE SUPPOSED TRUE FOR IN THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION PAGE 67 LINE 12 PRODUCTA L F INCIDET IN I IS NOT PROVED NOR DOTH IT FOLLOW FROM HIS QUONIAM IGITUR IN THE SECOND DEMONSTRATION PAGE 68 LINE 34 35 RECTA L FINCIDIT IN X IS NOT PROVED NOR DOTH IT FOLLOW FROM HIS QUARE IN HIS THIRD DEMONSTRATION PAGE 71 LINE 7 PRODUCTA Y P TRANSIBIT PER M IS SAID GRATIS NOR IS ANY PROOF OFFERED FOR IT AND SO THIS WHOLE STRUC TURE FALLS TO THE GROUND AND WITHALL THE PROP 47 EL I DOTH STILL STAND FAST WHICH HE TELLS US PAGE 59 61 78 MUST HAVE FALLEN IF HIS DEMONSTRATIONS HAD STOOD AND SO GEOMETRY AND ARTHEMETICK DO STILL AGREE WHICH HE TELLS US PAGE 78 LINE 10 HAD OTHERWISE BEEN AT ODDS AND THIS THOUGH MUCH MORE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID IS AS MUCH AS NEED TO BE SAID AGAINST THAT PIECE PRINTED WITH

WATERS AND EXTRACTS MADE OUT OF THEM COMMUNICATED TO THE PUBLISHER BY WAY OF LETTER,I206870,A DISCOURSE OF DR R WITTIE RELATING TO THE NOTES OF DR FOOT IN NUMB 52 AND TO THOSE OF DR HIGHMORE IN NUMB 56 OF THESE TRACTS CONCERNING MINERAL WATERS AND EXTRACTS MADE OUT OF THEM COMMUNICATED TO THE PUBLISHER BY WAY OF LETTER SIR I MUST ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDG MYSELF MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THE REITERATED MENTION YOU HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO MAKE OF MY BOOK IN YOUR TRANSACTIONS AND YOUR PATIENT CONDESCENSION TO THE TROUBLE THAT HATH ENSUED THEREFROM TO YOU WHEREAS I COULD NOT HAVE ANY GROUND OF HOPE THAT ANY THING OF MINE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN UNDER YOUR NOTICE AND THIS GOODNESS OF YOURS GIVES ME ENCOURAGEMENT TO PRESUME AT THIS TIME TO DE SIRE YOUR FAVOR IN THEPERUSAL OF THESE LINES WHICH ARE OCCASI ONED1075 ONED FROM SOME OBSERVATIONS I HAVE MET WITH IN YOUR SAD TRANSACTIONS REFERRING TO MY SUBJECT AND FIRST IN NO 51 P 1039 L 40 IN MENTIONING THE PRINCIPLES OF SCARBROUGHWATER THERE WAS PRETERMITTED VITRIOL WHICH I SUPPOSE WAS NOT DESIGNEDLY DONE THIS I WAS TO PREMISE BECAUSE SOME THINGS THAT FOLLOW DO REFER TO THAT MINERAL NEXT I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF D FOOTS INGENIOUS NOTES AND LETTER IN YOUR NUMB 52 P 1050 WHICH HE GROUNDS UPON YOUR ENLARGED ACCOUNT OF MY BOOK ABOUT THE VOLATIL PARTS OF MINERAL WATERS TOGETHER WITH HIS QUERIES TO ALL WHICH THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE RETURNED A SPEEDY ANSWER FROM OLD OBSERVATIONS YET I WAS WILLING TO STAY TILL MY OCCASIONS COULD PERMIT ME TO STEP OVER TO SCARBROUGH TO RENEW MY EXPERIMENTS WHEREIN AS I RESOLVED TO BE MORE CRITICAL SO I HOPE MY RETURN WILL BE MORE SATISFACTORY TO ALL THAT ARE CONCERNED AS FOR TACHENIUS TO WHOM HE REFERS I CANNOT GET HIM IN LONDON AND THEREFORE CAN SAY NOTHING TO HIS PRINCIPLES IT IS CERTAIN THAT THESE SORTS OF MINERAL WATERS ARE MORE PLEASANT TO THE PALAT AND ALSO MORE EFFECTUAL IF THEY BE DRUNK AT THE FOUNTAINS THEN WHEN CARRIED AT DISTANCE YET SOME OF THEM WILL ENDURE CARRIAGE MUCH BETTER THAN OTHERS SUCH OF THEM AS ARE IMPREGNATED WITH A BODY OF MINERALS AS SCARBROUGH MAL TON AND THE SULPHURWELL AT KNARESBROUGH WILL BETTER INDURE CARRIAGE THAN THE SWEETWEELL AT KNARESBROUGH AND THE SAUVENIR IN GERMANY C WHICH HAVE IMBIBED LITTLE OR NOTHING BUT THE VOLATIL SPIRITS OR VAPORS OF SOME MINERALS WHICH QUICKLY E VAPORATE IF REMOVED FROM THEIR SPRINGS NOW THOUGH SCARBROUGHWATER WILL ENDURE CARRIAGE AS FAR AS ANY I KNOW AND YET RETAIN ITS PURGING QUALITY EVEN TO MANY DAYS OR WEEKS WHEN IT STINKS BECAUSE OF ITS LARGE PROPORTION OF MINERAL SALTS WHICH ARE NOT LOST BY CARRIAGE AND WILL CAR RY IT THROUGH THE BODY YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT IT SUFFERS A GREAT ALTERATION AND DECAY OF VERTUE BEING CONVEYED AT DISTANCE WHICH PROBABLY MUST PROCEED FROM THE LOSS OF SOME VOLATIL PARTS WHEREUPON ARE ALSO LOST SOME ALTERATIVE PROPERTIES BY WHICH IT SHOULD FORTIFY THE CRASIS OF THE STOMACH AND OTHER NERVOUS PARTS OR OPEN OBSTRUCTIONS OR EXPEL THE STONEC AND THENCE IT IS THAT I NEVER SAW A GOOD CURE DONE BY IT AT DISTANCE1076 DISTANCE NOR CAN IT BE SUPPOSED THAT THESE WATERS WHICH HAVE IN THEM A BODY OF MINERAL SALTS CAN WANT THOSE VOLAT I SPIRITS WHICH OTHERS POSSESS THAT HAVE NO MINERALS AT ALL NAY ITS PLAIN THAT EVEN SCARBROUGHWATER BEING DRUNK AT THE TOWN WHICH IS BUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE SPAW HATH NOTHING SO PLEASANT A RELISH UPON THE PALAT AS IT HATH AT THE FOUNTAINAND SOME OBSERVE ITS NOT SO OPERATIVE BUT WHETHER THAT ALTERATI ON COME FROM A SUDDEN LOSS OF ANY SPIRITS I SHALL NOT HASTILY DETERMIN BUT DO RATHER CHUSE TO MAKE IT OUT THUS IT IS SUCH AN ALTERATION AS WE OBSERVE IN WINE OR ALE WHICH AFTER A WHILE LOOSES THE BRISKE TASTE OR RELISH WHICH IT HAD BEING NEW DRAWN OUT OF THE CASK WHEREBY IT IS NOT SO GRATEFUL TO THE PALAT WHILE YET PERHAPS THERE IS LITTLE OR NO LOSS OF ANY VINOUS OR FRUMENTAL SPIRIT BUT THEN AFTER A DAY OR TWO IT BECOMS WHITISH IN COLOUR AND SUFFERS SOME DEGREES OF PUTREFACTION NOTWITHSTANDING I COULD NEVER DISCERN IT TO LOOSE OF ITS QUAN TITY AS FRAMBESARIUS AND VAN HEER DO AFFIRM CONCERNING THE GERMAN AS I HAVE CITED THEM P 101 OF MY ANSWER NOW THAT I MAY YET MORE FULLY MAKE OUT THE TOUTH OF WHAT I HAVE ASSERTED ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES OF SCARBROUGHSPAW I HERE PRESENT TO YOUR VIEW THESE SEVERAL PARTS OF IT WITH THE MANNER OF EXTRACTION AS TOUCHING THE VITRIOL I MUST REFER YOU TO MY BOOK WHERE I HOPE I HAVE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED IT TO BE ONE OF THEM ESPECI ALLY TO P424344 SINCE IT BEING THERE PRINCIPALLY IN ITS VO LATIL PARTS IT CANNOT BE SO ESPECIALLY REPRESENTED TO THE SENSES AT DISTANCE WHILE YET IT IS MOST CONSPICUOUS AT THE WELL AFTER DISTILLATION OR EVAPORATION OF THE WATER TAKEN CLEAR OUT OF THE FOUNTAIN AND STRAINED FROM ALL SABULOUS MIXTURE THERE IS FOUND THAT BODY OF MINERALS SIGNED A VIZ AN OUNCE IN FIVE QUARTS AND IN DRY YEARS 10 DRACHMS WHICH I TAKE TO BE THE PRODUCT OF THE FIVE MINERALS IRON VITRIOL ALOME NITRE AND SALT WHICH THE WATER IS IMPREGNATED WITHAL AND SEEMS TO HAVE A COMPOUND TASTE OF SHARPE SALT ACID AND SOMEWHAT STIPTICK AND INDEED A TERTIUM DIVERSE FROM THEM ALL DISSOLVE THIS BODY OF MINERALS IN PURE SPRINGWATER OR DI STILLED WATER AND THEN FILTER IT THROUGH CAPPAPER THERE WILL STAY A LITTLE INSIPID EARTH IN THE FILTER BUT THE WATER WILL BE EXCEEDING1077 EXCEEDING BRACKISH EVAPORATE THAT WATER AWAY AND THERE REMAINS THE BODY SIGNED B WHICH BEING DULY PREPARED AND TIME ALLOWED WHICH I NOW HAVE NOT I HAVE SOMETIMES SEEN TO SHOOT INTO STIRIAS AN INCH LONG BEING SET TO CHRYSTALLIZE IN A COLD CELLAR THIS I JUDGE TO BE FOR THE GREATER PART NITER RESEMBLING MUCH IN TASTE THAT NITER WHICH BREAKS OUT UPON THE CLIFFE NEAR THE WELL MENTIONED P 106 OF MY ANSWER DISSOLVE AGAIN THIS BODY IN DISTILLED WATER AND FILTER IT AND THE WATER SHALL BE VERY BRACKISH BUT THERE SHALL REMAIN IN THE FILTER THE POWDER SIGNED C WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE ALUMINOUS PART THIS IS SOMETIMES FOUND TO BE LIKE A CHRISTALLIN SAND AS YOU HAVE IT IN THE PAPER SIGNED C C I THINK THE DIFFE RENCE IN THE SHOOTING ARISETH FROM THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF HEAT WHICH IS GIVEN IT EVAPORAT THIS WATER AWAY AND YOU HAVE A SALT MARKT D OR THAT D D THE DIFFERENCE BETWIXT THEM IS IN THE DEGREES OF HEAT IN BOTH WHICH IF YOU NOTE IT THERE ARE SOME SMALL STIRIAE WHICH I TAKE TO BE THE NITROUS PARTICLES INTER SPERSED THIS I HAVE SOMETIMES DEPURATED TILL IT HATH BECOME AS WHITE AS CHALK AND YET RETAINED ITS SALTNESS AS YOU HAVE IT SIGNED D D D NOW WHETHER THIS SALT BE FROM THE SEA OR RATHER THE SALT OF ALL THE MINERALS I SHALL LEAVE IT TO OTHERS TO JUDGE MY OPINION IS THAT IT IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE PRODUCT OF THE MINERALS WHICH YET MAY RECEIVE SOME SMALL ADDITION FROM THE SEA WHEN THE SPAWWATER IS FIRST SET UPON THE FIRE THERE FALLS TO THE BOTTOM A YELLOWISH POWDER WHICH IF THAT WATER BE FILTRED STAYS BEHIND MARKT E WHETHER THIS BE THE SAME WITH THE O CHRE THAT IS FOUND IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL WHEN THE WA TER IS CONVEYED AT DISTANCE I CANNOT SAY BUT THEY ARE BOTH OF A COLOUR HERE I HAD THOUGHT TO HAVE SENT YOU THE BLACK SEDIMENTMEN TIONED P 66 OF MY ANSWER WHICH FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL AFTER THE WATER HATH RECEIVED A TINCTURE FROM THE GALL WHICH ALSO CALCINETH OF A DARK BROWN COLOUR WHICH I TAKE TO BE THE IRON MINERAL BUT IT BEING HARD FROSTY WEATHER WHEN I WAS LAST AT SCARBROUGH IT WOULD NOT SEPARATE IF YOU DESIRE IT I SHALL SUPPLY IT IN SUMMER NOW BECAUSE MY ADVERSARY HATH MADE A GREAT RUSLE ABOUT THE1078 THE CALCINING OF THE MINERALS WHICH HE SAITH IS WHITE AND THEREUPON ENDEAVORS TO EXCLUDE VITRIOL AND IRON FROM THEIR NUM BER I HAVE SENT YOU SOME OF THEM CACIND AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE CRUCIBLE SIGNED F WHICH YOU MAY SEE HAVE A MANIFEST APPEARANCE OF A RED COLOUR TO USE HIS OWN EXPRESSION WHOSE WORDS I HAVE CITED P 57 OF MY ANSWER NOW SINCE THIS COOUR CANNOT BE SUPPOSED TO COME FROM NITER ALOM OR SALT IT MUST EVEN UPON HIS OWN PRINCIPLES COME FROM VITRIOLOR I RON AND I JUDGE IT TO COME FROM IRON WHICH IS THERE IN ITS BO DY AND IF YOU TAKE THE BODY OF MINERALS WHICH WE FIRST SPAKE OF TO BE FOUND IN THE SPAWWATER AND CALCINE IT AND SO RUB IT INTO A FINE POWDER AND THEN EDULCORATE IT IN PURE OR DISTILLED WATER AND AFTERWARDS FILTER IT YOU SHALL FIND A NITROUS SALT NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS EXPRESSED BEFORE MARKT B AND THE O THER FOLLOWING PARTS ALSO BUT A LARGER QUANTITY STAYS ALWAYS IN THE FILTER CHRYSTALLIZED THROUGH THE MORE VEHEMENT HEAT OF THE FIRE BUT THERE ARE OTHER PARTS WHICH I FETCH OUT OF THIS BODY OF MINERALS WHICH DOUBTLESS DO MUCH CONTRIBUTE TO THE CURES PERFORMED BY THIS WATER AND USED WITH OTHER VEHICLES ARE OF SINGULAR USE IN HYPOCHONDRIACK DISEASES I TOOK SIX OUNCES OF THE MINERALS WHICH I PUT INTO A REPORT AND PLACED IT IN A FUR NACE COVERED WITH SAND INCREASING THE FIRE GRADUALLY THE RE CEIVER BEING CLOSE JOYNED TO THE RETORT AND SO LUTED AS NOT THE LEAST VOLATIL SPIRIT COULD EVAPORATE FIRST CAME THIS IN THE GLASS SIGNED G ABOUT AN OUNCE IN QUANTITY WHICH IS THE PHLEGM THEN WITH ANOTHER RECEIVERAS WELL LUTED THE HEAT INCREASING CAME THE ACID SPIRIT SIGNED H NEAR HALF AN OUNCE IN QUANTITY I HAVE SOMETIMES FOUND IT MUCH MORE SHARPE AND ACID THAN THIS IS AND INDEED I TOOK IT TOO SOON AWAY FROM THE FIRE YET THIS GIVETH A TINCTURE TO A DECOCTION OF ROSES LIKE SPIRIT OF VI TRIOL OR SALT I HAVE SOMETIMES OBSERVED THIS SHARPE SPIRIT LIKE SPIRIT OF VITRIOL TO CHRYSTALLIZE TO THE SIDES OF THE GLASS WHEN IT HATH BEEN LONG KEPT AND LOOSING ITS ACIDITY TO BECOME LIKE THE PHLEGM I NOW COME TO THE QUERIES OF D FOOT TO WHICH I SHALL SPEAK AS TO MATTER OF FACT REFERRING THE REASON OF THINGS TO BE DISCUSSED BY BETTER HEADS TO1079 TO THE FIRST I DISTILLED SCARBOROUGH SPAWWATER IN A GLASSSTILL LUTING THE RECEIVER SO CLOSE THAT NO SPIRIT EVEN OF WINE COULD ESCAPE MEAND IT YIELD ED NOTHING BUT AN INSIPID WATER AS ORDINARY SPRINGWATER USES TO DO AND I THINK I MAY CONFIDENTLY AFFIRMTHAT NONE OF THOSE MINERAL SPRINGS WILL AF FORD ANY OTHER TO THE SECOND THE WATER OF SCARBROUGHAND ALL SUCH AS ARE IMPREGNA TED WITH A BODY OF MINERALS WHETHER THEY BE LET STAND OR CONVEYED AT DI STANCE DO LET FALL A YELLOWISH SEDIMENT IN TIME BUT SO IT IS NOT IN KNARES BROUGH SWEETWELL NOR SUCH OTHERS AS HAVE NO MINERALSBUT HAVE ONELY IM BIBED THE VAPORS OR ODORS OF SOME MINERAL TO THE THIRD WHEN SUCH WATERS ARE MOVED BY CARRIAGE THEY DO SOO NER PRECIPITATE THAT YELLOW SEDIMENT TO THE BOTTOM AND ESPECIALLY IF CON VEYED IN OAKEN VESSELS TO THE FOURTH THIS YELLOWISH SEDIMENT IS PLAINLY DISCERNABLE BOTH IN THEIR SPRINGHEADS AND STREAMS NAYEVEN KNARESBROUGH WATER DOTH A LITTLE COLOUR THE CISTERN IN TRACT OF TIME NOTWITHSTANDING IT HATH VERY LITTLE OF THE SUBSTANCE TO THE FIFTH THOSE BOTTLES THAT ARE STOPD CLOSE WHETHER THEY BE MO VED OR NOT WILL LONGER KEEP THEIR BRISK RELISH THAN SUCH AS ARE LEFT OPEN AND ALSO LONGER RETAIN THEIR MEDICAL VERTUES TOGETHER WITH THEIR COLOUR AND SEDIMENT TO THE SIXTH I FIND NOT ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE VESSELS WHEREIN SCAR BROUGHWATER IS PUT VIZ A GLASSBOTTLE OR AN OXBLADDER SAVE THIS THAT THAT WHICH WAS IN THE BLADDER WOULD NOT RECEIVE SO BLACK A TINCTURE FROM THE GALL AS THE OTHER BUT RATHER A CLARET TO THE SEVENTH I COULD NEVER YET DEVISE NOR ANY OTHER I HAVE MET WITH TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF THE APERIENT VERTUE OF SCARBROUGHWATER NOR TO HINDER THE PRECIPITATION OF THE YELLOW SEDIMENT IF REMOVED AT DISTANCE TO THE EIGHTH NOTWITHSTANDING THAT SCARBROUGHWATER LETS FALL THE OCHRE YET IT REMAINS PURGATIVE FROM THE REST OF THE MINERAL SALTS AND SPI RITS WHICH YET IT RETAINS EVEN TILLAND WHEN IT STINKS AND PERHAPS BEING SETID IT MAY PURGE THE MORE AS SOME HAVE TOLD ME WHO HAVE DRUNK IT WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO STOP THEIR NOSES THOUGH IT HATH BEEN WITH VERY MUCH PREJUDICE TO THEIR HEALTH AS I HAVE MADE OUT IN MY FORMER BOOK TO WIT SCARBROUGHSPAW EDIT 2 P 220 221 BUT AS FOR KNARES BROUGH SWEETWELL THAT WILL BE FOUND ENERVATED THOUGH NO OCHRE APPEAR IN THE BOTTOM TO THE NINTH THAT OF KNARESBROUGH AND SUCH LIKE ARE BETTER EXPLI CATED TO HAVE LOST THEIR VERTUES BY AN AVOLATION OF SPIRITUOUS PARTS SINCE THEY HAVE NOTHING ELSE WHEREIN THE VERTUE CAN CONSIST WHEREAS IT WILL NOT SERVE FOR SCARBROUGHFROM WHICH THESE SPIRITS CANNOT IN REASON BE EXCLUDED NAY THEY ARE FOUND MORE EMINENTLY IN THE MINERALS AND THEREFORE WE MUST ALLOW TO IT AND TO SUCH LIKE AN INTESTINE ALTERATION OR PRECIPITATION O OF1080 OF THEIR PARTS OR SOME SUCH EXPRESSIONWHICH I REFER TO THE LEARNED TO CON SIDER OF I NOW PASS ON TO SPEAK A FEW WORDS CONCERNING THE 3 CHYMICAL MAXIMS QUOTED BY D FOOT IT IS VERY TRUE THAT GREAT MEDICAL VERTUES DO CONSIFT IN THE VOLATILE SULPHURS OF METALS AND MINERALS YET WE MAY NOT EXCLUDE THEIR FIXED PARTS FROM THEIR USE IN PHYSICK AS THE FIXT SALT OFSTEEL AND EVEN STEEL IT SELF WE USE WITH GOOD SUCCESS AND SCHRODERUS HATH A GREAT MANY SINGULAR GOOD MEDICINS WHICH HE PREPARES EVEN OUT OF THE FIXT SALTS OF ALL THE METALS AND MINERALS THAT WHICH HE OBSERVES IN THE SECOND VIZ THAT ACIDS AND ALCALIES MU TUALLY OPERATE UPON ONE ANOTHER EVEN TO AN UTTER AMISSION OF THEIR FORMER ACTIVITIES AND A PRODUCTION OF A TERTIUM NEUTRUM AS IT IS VERY TRUE SO IT IS SUFFICIENTLY VERIFYD IN THESE MINERALS WHEREWITH THESE WATERS OF SCAR BROUGH ARE IMPREGNATED FOR THEY ARE BECOME A QUITE OTHER THING TO WHAT THEY ARE IN THEIR PRINCIPLES AGREEING IN SOME THINGS WITH THEM AND YET DISAGREEING IN OTHER THINGS AS I HAVE MADE OUT P 18 19AND AGAIN P61 62SO FAR AS WAS PERTINENT TO MY PURPOSE CONCERNING THE THIRD THERE IS NOT DOUBT TO BE MADE OF ITS VERITY AND AS TO THE HYPOTHESIS HE DRAWS FROM THE SAID PREMISES I HAVE HAD OCCASION PARTICULARLY TO SPEAK TO IT P 5 6 AND AGAIN P 17 18 AND THEREFORE I SHALL SAY NO MORE OF IT HERE BUT PASS ON TO THE NUMB 56 P 1128 WHICH OBLIGETH ME TO SAY SOMETHING AND THAT IS TO A LETTER FROM DR HIGHMORE TO WHICH GENTLEMAN I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED FOR HIS CANDOUR IN OWNING ANY ADVANTAGE I HAVE GOTTEN OF MY ADVERSARY THOUGH HE SAITH BEING A STRANGER TO THE WATER HE CANNOT JUDGE WHETHER EITHER OF US HATH GOTTEN THE RIGHT OF HIS SIDE AND HE DOUBTS WHETHER SOME OF THE MINERAL PRINCIPLES MAY NOT BE LEFT OUT I HAVE MADE IT APPEAR THAT MY ANTAGONIST AFTER ALL HIS SEVERE DENIALS OF THE MINERALS I ASSERTED TO BE IN THE WATER DOTH AT LAST IN HIS OWN BOOK ASSENT TO THEM ALL P 112 113 OF MY ANSWER AND I CANNOT TAKE IT UN KINDLY THAT DR H OR ANY OTHER LEARNED AND INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN THAT DESIGNES NOT TO QUARREL AS HE SAITH SHOULD FOR SATISFACTION ASK FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT IT THE DOCTOR IS A STRANGER TO THIS WATER YET HATH MY REASONS FOR ALL THE MINERALS BESIDES MY ADVERSARIES CONCESSIONS NONE OF WHICH I COULD LEAVE OUT IF HE OR ANY OTHER INGENIOUS PERSON THAT IS NOT YET SATISFYED WOULD BE AT THE PAINES TO TAKE A VIEW IF THESE PARTS OF THE WATER WHICH I HEREWITH PRESENT TO YOUR VIEW BE NOT ENOUGH I DOUBT NOT BUT THEY WOULD RETURN TO MY OPINION NEXT HE WONDERS WHY I MENTION ALOME AMONG THE REST WHICH HE SAITH EXICCAT ADSTRINGIT INCRASSAT AND HE UNDERSTANDS NOT HOW THIS WA TER SHOULD BE SO HIGHLY DEOPPILATIVE AND BENEFICIAL TO HYPOCHONDRIACAL AND CACHECTICAL PERSONS BEING IMPREGNATED WITH SO GREAT AN ASTRINGENT NEITHER SAITH HE DOTH THE DR DECLARE BY1081 BY THIS AS ALSO BY WHAT FOLLOWS IT APPEARS THAT DR H DID READ MY BOOKWHILE I TREATED OF THE MINERALS VERY SUPERFICIALLY OR ELSE HAD MUCH FORGOTTEN WHEN HE WRIT THAT LETTER NOTHING IS MORE PLAIN THAN THAT OUR WATER HATH IMBIBED ALOME INSOMUCH THAT MR S IN THE FORMER PART OF HIS BOOK AGAINST ME OWNS NOTHING ELSE ALMOST BUT ALOME AND FOR THE AD STRINGENT C PROPERTY OF ALOME IT IS VERY TRUE WHAT DR H SAITH TO WHICH I HAVE ALSO SPOKEN EXPRESLY P 126 127 OF MY ANSWERAND PLAIN LY PROVED THAT IT CAN NEITHER OPEN OBSTRUCTIONS NOR LOOSE THE BELLY FROM THENCE BUT I HAVE FULLY EVINCED THAT ALL THE REST ARE THERE AS WELL AS ALOME AND TREATED OF THEM ALL AND THEIR PROPERTIES COMMUNICATED TO THIS WATER IN MY FIRST BOOK VIZ SCARBROUGHSPAWEDIT2P 142143 144 145BESIDES THAT I HAVE IN THE SEVERAL PLACES OF MY LATTERBOOK TOUCHED UPON THEIR VERTUES AS VITRIOL P 71 C IRON P7579 NITER P 85 SALT P86 AND AGAIN MORE FULLY OF THEM ALL P 130 131132 SO THAT I HAVE PLAINLY DECLARED BOTH NEGATIVELY THAT IT CANNOT HAVE THESE PROPER TIES FROM THE ALOME AND ALSO AFFIRMATIVELY FROM WHENCE IT HATH THEM ONELY FROM THE STIPTICK AND ASTRINGENT PROPERTIES OF THE IRON AND ALOME IT IS THAT THIS WATERTHOUGH IT BE PURGATIVE YET NEVER RUNS THE BODY INTO DYSENTERIES AS TO RHE TINGING WITH GALL WHICH HE MENTIONS I HAVE PROVED THAT TO PROCEED FROM THE VITRIOL AND THAT NEITHER ALOME CRUDE NOR CALCINED NOR ANY OF THE OTHER DO COMMUNICATE THAT PROPERTY TO THE WATER EXCEPTING IN ONE PLACE OF THIS CLIFFE NEAR THE SPAW WHERE A LITTLE ALOMESTONE THAT LYES IN THE VITRIOLIN JUYCE WHICH BREAKS OUT ABOUT THE BREADTH OF AN HAT WILL GIVE A TINCTURE WITH GALL AS THE EARTH ALSO IN THAT SPOT WILL DO BECAUSE TIS IMPREGNATED WITH VITRIOL BUT ALL THE 100 LOADS OF ALOMEEARTH BESIDES THAT ARE IN THE CLIFF WLIL NOT DO IT NEITHER CRUDE NOR CALCIND AGAIN THE DOCTOR WONDERS WHY I MAKE IRON AND VITRIOL TWO DISTINCT CONSTITUENTS OF THIS WATER AND CALL IT FERRUM VITRIOLATUM INFERRING THAT IRON AND VITRIOL ARE BOTH ONE AND NOT TWO DISTINCT MINERALS THESE ARE MY ADVERSARIES OBJECTIONS IN HIS BOOK TO WHICH THE DOCTOR IS NOT AWARE THAT I HAVE GIVEN ANSWER TO THE FORMER P 5 6 VIZ THAT I MIGHT DISTINGUISH IT FROM VITRIOLUM CUPREUM WHICH IS EMETICK TO THE LATTER I HAVE BEEN LARGER AS THE MATTER REQUIRED AND HAVE GIVEN I THINK SATISFACTORY REASONS FROM P 35 TO 41 AND CLEARLY PROVDTHAT THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING BUT AS THESE GENTLEMEN WILL HAVE VITRIOL AND IRON TO BE ONE THING SO I FINDE DR JORDEN CAP 7 OF NATBATHSMAKING A DOUBT WHETHER ALOME AND VITRIOL BE DISTINST IN SPECIE SO THAT BY THIS RECKONING IT MIGHT HAVE SUFFICED FOR ALL TO HAVE MENTIONED ANY OF THE THREE AND I MIGHT HAVE SAVED MY SELF SOME LABOUR BUT I SUSPECT I SHOULD NOT SO HAVE SATISFIED THE MOST PART OF LEARNED MENIN SO CONFOUNDING THREE OF THE PRIN CIPLES BUT MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED A MORE JUST AND SEVERE REPROOF FOR IT NEXT DR H OBSERVES THAT I HAVE SAID THAT VITRIOL WHICH IS FOUND O 2 ALONE1082 ALONE UPON THE ROCK WILL BY THE SUMMER HEAT BE TURND INTO IRON AND THEN HE MAKES INFERENCE UPON THE HYPOTHESIS WHICH IS A MISTAKE FOR I DO NOT SAY SO IN ANY PART OF MY BOOK BUT P 45 I DO SAYTHAT SOME OF THAT WHICH IS LIKE ORDINARY EARTH FALLING DOWN TURNS TO AN IRONSTONEAND IS FUSIBLE IN THE FIRE IN THE NEXT SECTHE IS POSITIVE ABOUT THE COLOUR OF ROMAN VITRIOLWHICH I SAID TO BE FACTITIOUS CONCERNING THIS I FIND AUTHORS MUCH DIFFERINGGA LEN L 9 DE SIMPL MED FAC MENTIONS 3 SORTS WHICH HE FOUND AT CYPRUS AND TELLS OF A GREEN SORT BUT NOT A WORD OF BLEW SO DR JORDEN C 7 IN DEED SCHRODERUS AND ADRIAN TOLL SPEAK OF A BLEW SORT IN THIS DISSENT OF WRITERS I CONSULTED SOME LEARNED AND OBSERVING GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN AT ROME AND THEY ASSURE METHAT THE ROMANS ADDE THAT COLOUR WHEN THEY CAST INTO FORMS MOREOVER IF THAT BE A RIGHT DISTRIBUTION OF VITRIOLS INTO THEIR SEVERAL KINDS WHICH SOME OF OUR MODERN CHYMISTS MAKE VIZ THAT THERE ARE BUT THREE SORTS VITRIOL OF IRON OF COPPER AND WHITE VITRIOL THEN I THINK IT WILL FOLLOW THAT I AM IN THE RIGHT FOR ONE IS YELLOWVIZ THAT OF IRON THE OTHER GREEN AND THE WHITE IS THAT WHICH IS MADE BLEWBUT TIS NOT WORTH THE WHILE TO CONTEND ABOUT IT IN MY 120 P HE SAITH I AM DISSATISFIED WITH WHAT MY ADVERSARY ASSERTS CONCERNING THE SALTNESS OF THE SEA PROCEEDING FROM FOSSIL SALT C BUT RA THER THAT I ALLOW THE PERIPATETICAL TORREFACTION OF THE UN TO BE THE CAUSE ALL I SAY THERE ISTHAT THE PERIPATETICKS THOUGHTIT CAME SHORT OF AN ADE QUAT CAUSE AND THEREUPON THEY FLY TO THAT TORREFACTION BUT IT DOES NOT THEREFORE FOLLOW THAT I ALLOW IT I HE TRUTH ISI LIKE NEITHER OF THE OPINI ONS BUT HAVE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THEM BOTH TO SPEAK OUT I RATHER THINK THE SALTNESS OF THE SEA TO BE CONNATURAL TO IT AS THE FRESHNESS OF OTHER WATER IS TO IT AND THAT IT WAS MADE SO FROM THE BEGINNING BUT THAT I RESERVED FOR ANOTHER DISCOURSE AS FOR THE ARGUMENT WHICH THERE I BROUGHT TO BACK MY ASSERTION VIZ THAT IF THE SALT OF THE SEA SHOULD COME FROM FOSSIL SALT IT WOULD KILL THE FISH HE SAITH IT IS NOT CONVINCING THIS I SECONDED BY AN INSTANCE CONCER NING THE SALTSEA WHICH KILLS ALL FISH AND THENCE IS CALLED MARE MORTUUM WHICH I THINK IS OF GREATER FORCE TO CONFIRM IT THAN THE DOCTORS INSTANCE OF OYSTERS WHICH HE HAS EXPERIMENTED TO BE PRESERVED BY SALT AND WATER CAN BE TO CONTRADICT IT FOR THOSE ZOOPHYTA HAVE BUT A DULL AND IMPERFECT LIFEAND ARE NOT SO PROPER TO BE DRAWN INTO INSTANCE IN OUR CASE WE KNOW THEY WILL KEEP A LONG TIME IN THEIR OWN PICKLE OR MOISTUREAND WE HAVE ALSO KNOWN THEM TO STINK NOTWITHSTANDING THE ADDITION OF SALT AND WATER AND THEREFORE LITTLE JUDGMENT CAN BE TAKEN FROM THEM IT IS MOST CERTAIN AS HE OBSERVES THAT THE INLAND SALTSPRINGS ARE SUCH FROM FOSSIL SALT AND IT WERE WORTH TRYING WHETHER THOSE SALTSPRINGS WOULD NOT KILL A PILCHARD OR ANY OTHER SORT OF SEAFISH THAT LIVETH A PERFECT SENSITIVE LIFE BUT I FEAR SIR I HAVE BEEN TOO TEDIOUS YOU WILL C AN

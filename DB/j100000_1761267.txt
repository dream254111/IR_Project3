deserves Among the indications of this fact we point to the experiments which are in progress in New York Philadelphia St Louis Chicago Baltimore and other impor tant cities to the admirable debate never we believe adequately reported which oc curred in the section of mechanics at the Philadelphia meeting of the American associa tion to the report presented to congress a year or more ago on technical education by Gen Eaton the U S commissioner to the interest which has been awakened by the Brit ishcommission report on the same subject of which three volumes have appeared and finally to the action of the Slater trustees in insisting that the income which they distribute among the schools for freedmen shall only be given to schools where manual labor or handi craft is encouraged Some light is thrown upon principles and methods by a recent paper on technical educa tion by David Sandeman and E M Dixon of Glasgow They discuss the relations of the elementary school and the workshop second the part which secondary schools may take in preparing boys for industrial pursuits third the sphere of school workshops or tech nical schools Their conclusions which are of general interest though intended only for Scotland are briefly stated as follows Every child should have as good a general education as he can get as circumstances differ schools must be adapted to different wants of the industrial classes there should be elementary schools for children less than thirteen years old secondary schools for more who can con tinue to study until they are sixteen and in No 971884 both school workshops should be established apprenticeships might thus be reduced in time finally trades should be taught systematically to the young after they leave school either in a workshop or in a special building detached from a workshop as experience may suggest AN ARGUMENT which did good duty during the dark ages but which has fallen into disuse in later times has seldom been more naively employed than in the following passage taken from a little book just published  On the dis covery of the periodic law  Are the atomic weights invariable  This ques tion must most probably be answered in the affirma tive If the atomic weight of an element varies such variation is most likely very slight otherwise the simple relation between the atomic weights of the elements when arranged in their natural order would be liable to be disturbed Mr Newlands late professor of chemistry in the City of London college who is the author of the above passage is also a claimant to the honor of having discovered Mendce lejews periodic law How far chemists were fiom suspecting the truth of that law in 1866 appears from the fact that at a meeting of the Chemical society Prof G F Foster humor ously inquired of Mr Newlands whether he had ever examined the elements according to the order of their initial letters HIow tMUCt brighter is sun than moon  Can anybody tell TIHas anybody tried to tell What shall be the standard of measuremen t Sir William Thomson has lately printed a note which conveys some curious data bearing on these questions During the meeting of the British association at York in 1881 lie ob served the moon when it was nearly full alnd at about midnight Ile found the light to be equal to that of a candle at a distance of two hundred and thirty centimetres Making no account of the loss of moonlight in transmis    1       1 524 S CIt sion through the earths atmosphere he com puted that twentyseven thousand million million candles must be spread over the moons earth ward hemisphere painted black to send us as much light as we receive from her Probably forty thousand million million candles would be required to allow for absorption Sir Wil liam carried his computations a little farther and figured that if the face of the moon which we see were painted black and covered with candles standing packed in square order touch ing one another all burning normally the light received at the earth would be about the same in quantity as estimated by our eyes as it really is How does moonlight compare with sunlight On the 8th of December 1882 Sir William Thomson in Glasgow measured the brilliancy of the sunlight at one PM and comlputed that it was about fiftythree thousand times greater than that of a candleflame This he says is more than three times the value found by Arago for the intensity of the suns light  So much for a Glasgow December sun Hence he derived the conclusions that the Glas gow sunlight was seventyone thousand times the York moonlight and that  we cannot be very far wrong in estimating the light of full moon as about a seventythousandth of the sunlight anywhere on the earth Those who are curious to know more of this inquiry will find the note to which we call attention in the proceedings of the Glasgow philosophical so ciety for 188283 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR o Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith The oldest living type of vertebrates I WAS gratified to have my own conclusions as to the systematic relations of the galeoid Selachians verified by so competent an original investigator as Mr Garman The differences between us now are fictitious rather than real or better perhaps they are chiefly differences of expression As to the characters of the Opistharthri it must be remembered that I assigned them long before Chlamy doselachus was known and then the statement that among living sharks they alone exhibit the  peculi arities specified was literally true  Nl UC  VOI IV No 97 The palatoquadrate not articulated with the skull is a true character of the typical sharks and Rhinae Of course the apparatus being the suspen sorium of the lower jaw must have some connection with the cranium but it is indirect and not direct The name Anarthri is therefore quite appropriate contrasting well with  Opistharthri  and  Proarthri The newly proposed term Mesarthri is however unobjectionable although I should still independ ent of priority prefer Anarthri No one who took an intelligent interest in the subjects in question would be misled by the name  Anarthri or the diag noses of the Anarthri and Rhinae I must dissent from the opinion that the Clado dontidae are related to the Chlamydoselachidae rather than to the Hybodontidae To traverse the question would however infringe too much on your space Mr Garman in his substitute for my provisional diagnosis of the Selachophichthyoidei vertebral condition unknown has added to our knowledge of the group by verifying my suggestion Science April 11 1884 that the  anatomy will probably reveal a structure most like that of the Opistharthri I am pleased to find that the views of Mr Garman as to the remoteness of the Xenacanthini or Ich thyolomi from the true selachians agree with those expressed by myself The Xenacanthini in fact appear to me to be true fishes rather than selachians although not teleosts as has lately been urged TIIEO GILL Hornblende andesite from the new Bogosloff volcano A short time since there were received at the Na tional museum from Lieut George M Stoney of the Ounalaska several fragments of rock from the new volcano on Bogosloff Island in Bering Sea On ac count of the interest just now attached to this locality it is thought a brief notice of these may not be out of place here The rocks are hornblende andesites Two varieties were received  one very light gray and slightly pur plish in color finegrailed friable and somewhat porous the other dark gray in color and much more firm and compact in texture both varieties contain ing macroscopic hornblende and plagioclase and uln der the microscope seen to be nearly identical each consisting of a gray groundmass in which are em bedded deep reddishbrown strongly dichroic horn blendes light green augites and numnerous crystals of a plagioclase felspar Sanidin is also present a very little apatite and tile usual sprinkling of ironl oxides which seem to be largely magnetite The groundmass consists of a microfelsitic base carrying colorless microlites grains of opacite and minute yellowish and greenish particles which are probably hornblende and augite The lightcolored variety contains slall patches of a nearly colorless glass while the dark variety seems felsitic throughout A more detailed description of these rocks will be given later GEO P MERRILL National museum Washington Dec 1 Edisons threewire system of distribution Referring to the article with the above heading in No 91 of Science Nov 21 it is not difficult to show that the conclusions reached are not in har mony with the fundamental proposition governing the size of electric conductors This proposition is that the additional runningexpense due to the re sistance of the conductor shall equal the interest on  on ov

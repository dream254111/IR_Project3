J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,110089,ON THE ANATOMY OF THE MOLECRICKET ABSTRACT,I207044,236 AGAINST HE PROCEEDS TO DESCRIBE HIS APPARATUS WHICH CONSISTED OF TWO THERMOMETERS A AND B OF LARGE AND NEARLY EQUAL BULBS GRADUATED TO QUARTERS OF CENTIGRADE DEGREES ONE WHITENED WITH A WASH OF CHALK AND WATER THE OTHER BLACKENED WITH INDIAN INK IN OTHER EXPERI MENTS A DIFFERENTIAL THERMOMETER WAS USED ONE BALL BEING ONLY EX POSED TO THE HEATING INFLUENCE UNDER VARIOUS COATINGS AND THE OTHER CAREFULLY SCREENED SO AS TO REDUCE THE EFFECT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO THAT ON A MERE AIR THERMOMETER A VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTS ON THE HEATING EFFECTS OF VARIOUS FLAMES INCANDESCENT METALS C ON THESE THERMOMETERS SO PREPARED AND BOTH SCREENED AND UNSCREENED WITH GLASS PLATES ARE THEN DETAILED AND THE AUTHOR THEN DRAWS HIS GENERAL CONCLUSIONS WHICH MAY BE THUS STATED 1 THAT THE HEAT RADIATED FROM ALL LUMINOUS HOT BODIES IS DIVIDED OR ANALYSED BY A GLASS SCREEN INTO TWO PORTIONS ONE OF WHICH IS STOPLPED BY THE SCREEN AND EMPLOYED IN INCREASING ITS TEMPERATURE AND THE OTHER PASSES THROUGH IT WITHOUT RAISING ITS TEMPERATURE 2 THAT BESIDES THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE NATURE OF THE TWO PORTIONS OF THE TOTAL RADIATION THEY DIFFER IN THEIR CAPABILITIES OF BEING ABSORBED BY THE SURFACES OF BODIES THAT PORTION WHICH PASSES FREELY THROUGH GLASS BEING ABSORBED MUCH MORE READILY BY BLACKENED SURFACES WHILE THE OTHER OR NONTRANSMISSIBLE PORTION IS NEARLY EQUALLY WELL AB SORBED BY BLACK AND WHITE SURFACES THE TEXTURE OF SURFACES RATHER THAN THEIR COLOUR HE SUPPOSES TO EXERCISE THE CHIEF INFLUENCE IN DE TERMINING THE ABSORPTION OF THIS LATTER PORTION THOUGH THIS LASTMEN TIONED OPINION IS PERHAPS RATHER ADOPTED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE LANGUAGE OF OTHERS THAN IN CONSEQUENCE OF ANY EXPERIMENTS DETAILED IN THE PRESENT PAPER ON THE ANATOMY OF THE MOLECRICKET BY J KIDD MD AND FRS REG PROF OF MEDICINE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD READ FEBRU ARY 3 AND FEBRUARY 10 1825 PHIL TRANS 1825 P 203 THE INSECT DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER IS COMMON IN CERTAIN PEAT BOGS A FEW MILES WEST OF OXFORD AND IS FOUND WITHIN 18 INCHES OF THE SURFACE LIKE THE MOLE ITS LIMBS ARE PARTICULARLY CALCULATED FOR BUR ROWING AND TO PREVENT THE NECESSITY OF ITS EXCAVATING A PASSAGE LARGE ENOUGH TO ADMIT OF ITS TURNING ROUND IT HAS THE POWER OF MOVING AS EASILY IN A RETROGRADE AS IN A PROGRESSIVE DIRECTION ITS COLOUR CLOSELY RESEMBLES THAT OF THE MOULD IN WHICH IT LIVES AND IN COMMON WITH MANY OTHER INSECTS IT HAS THE POWER OF ASSUMING A LIFELESS APPEARANCE WHEN SUDDENLY DISTURBED HAVING KEPT SOME OF THEM IN GLASS VES SELS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THE AUTHOR REMARKED THAT THEY PREFERRED THE POTATOE TO OTHER VEGETABLE FOOD BUT THAT THEY ATTACKED RAW MEAT WITH ESPECIAL GREEDINESS AND UPON EMERGENCY ATTACKED EACH OTHER IN WHICH CASE THE VICTOR SOON DEVOURED THE FLESHY AND SOFT PARTS OF THE VAN QUISHED BUT ALTLLOUGH THEY ARE VERY VORACIOUS THEY ARE EQUALLY REMARKABLE FOR THEIR POWER OF ABSTAINING FROM FOOD AND HAVE BEERN237 KEPT ALIVE FOR NINE OR TEN MONTHS IN GARDEN MOULD WITHOUT THE POS SIBILITY OF OBTAINING ANY OTHER NOURISHMENT THAN SUCH AS IT MIGHT CONTAIN HAVING NOTICED THE GENERAL HABITUDES AND CHARACTERS OF THE IN SECT DR KIDD PROCEEDS TO DESCRIBE ITS SEPARATE PARTS AND ENUMERATES THE PECULIARITIES OF THE HEAD THORAX AND ABDOMEN THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS HE OBSERVES MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE THOSE OF A GRAMINIVOROUS BIRD THAN OF ANY OTHER ANIMAL THE OESOPHAGUS TERMINATING IN A LARGE OVAL CROP COMMUNICATING BY A MUSCULAR TUBE WITH THE GIZZARD WHICH IS NEARLY SPHERICAL AND HAS A THICK EXTERNAL MUSCULAR COAT LINED BY A GLANDULAR MEMBRANE THE INNER SURFACE OF WHICH IS DIVIDED LONGITU DINALLY INTO SIX EQUAL PARTS EACH FURNISHED WITH THREE SERIES OF SER RATED TEETH OF THE HARDNESS OF TORTOISESHELL AND AMOUNTING IN ALL TO 270 IN HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION OF THE GRYLLOTALPA D KIDD STATES THAT TEN STIGMATA ARE DISTINCTLY VISIBLE OIL EACH SIDE OF THE BODY THE FIRST OF THESE SITUATED NEAR THE LOWER PART OF THE POSTERIOR RIDGE OF THE THORAX IS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS A MERE DOT OR POINT BUT AN ELONGATED FISSURE APPARENTLY CONNECTED WITH ALL THE TRACHENE BOTH OF THE THORAX AND HEAD TO DEMONSTRATE THE DISTRIBU TION OF THE TRACHEAE THE INSECT WAS DRIED IN AN EXHAUSTED RECEIVER CONTAINING MURIATE OF LIME A METHOD APPLICABLE TO MANY DELICATE ATOMICAL PREPARATIONS THEY PENETRATE EVERY PART OF THE BODY AND ARE POSSIBLY IN THE AUTHORS OPINION THE INSTRUMENTS OF SANGUINEOUS CIRCULATION IN INSECTS ABSORBING THE BLOOD IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FROM THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL AND THENCE CONVEYING IT OVER THE BODY NO DIFFICULTY HE APPREHENDS ATTACHES TO THE SUPPOSITION THAT SUCH AN ABSORPTION MAY TAKE PLACE SEEING THAT INNUMERABLE MI NUTE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE TRACHEAE PENETRATE THE INTESTINAL CANAL TO EVERY PART IF HE CONTINUES IT SHOULD BE URGED THAT THE TRACHEAE ARE NOT FOUND CHARGED WITH BLOOD AFTER THE DEATH OF THE ANIMAL IT MAY BE ANSWERED THAT THE ARTERIES ARE FOUND EMPTY AFTER DEATH IN THE HIGHER ORDERS OF ANIMALS HE ADDS THAT HE HAS SEEN SOME OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THOSE TRACHEAE WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH THE CEECA DISTENDED WITH A FLUID OF THE SAME COLOUR AS THAT FOUND IN THOSE OR GANS AND THOUGH HE HAS ONLY WITNESSED THIS IN TWO INSTANCES YET SUCH A FACT EVEN SINGLY TAKEN MUST BE ALLOWED TO BE OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE THE AUTHOR THEN ADVERTS TO THE OBJECTIONS WHICH MAY BE URGED AGAINST THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE TRANSUDATION OF CHYLE THROUGH THE COATS OF THE INTESTINES TRUSTING THAT HIS OPINION OF A SANGUINEOUS CIRCULA TION IN INSECTS WILL NOT BE HASTILY REJECTED AND CONCLUDES HIS PAPER WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE NERVES AND OF THE SEXUAL ORGANS OF THE IN SECT AND WITH SOME REMARLKS UPON THE ORGAN OF SOUND WHICH HE CON SIDERS AS PRODUCED BY THE WINGS AND IN NO WAY CONNECTED WITH A PECULIAR TENSE MEMBRANE SITUATED BETWEEN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH STIGMA ON EACH SIDE OF THE ABDOMEN

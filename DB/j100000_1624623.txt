evening there was a general session at which the usual complimentary resolutions were passed after which the 46th meeting of the Association was de clared adjourned As has been said this was an unusually good meeting The scien tific papers were above the average and the sections were well attended by citizens of Detroit as well as by members A num ber of the distinguished foreign guests gave papers and took part in the discussions During the Association week meetings were held by the American Chemistry So ciety the Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Science the Society of Eco nomic Entomologists and the Michigan 285 Academy of Sciences Some of these meet ings were held jointly with sections of the American Association It is believed that by offering proper courtesies to the affiliated societies more of these joint meetings can be held to the great advantage of the Associa tion and of the societies themselves ASAPH HALL JR General Secretary CURRENT NOTES ON PHYSIOGRAPHY THE ATHABASCA REGION TYRRELLs report on the country between Athabasca lake and Churchill river Geol Surv Canada Ann Rep VIII for 1895 1897 divides the region into Archaean and Cambrian areas The first is occupied by low rocky hills and ridges from fifty to a hundred and fifty feet in local relief sep arated by driftcovered depressions wooded or interrupted by small irregular lakes The second is a monotonous district of horizontal sandstones forming a sterile plain thinly wooded with few lakes The absence of deep valleys and the occurrence of lakes and rapids shows that the drainage is very new It is suggested that Atha baska lake occupies a preglacial valley ex cavated along the northern boundary of the sandstone area when the land thereabouts stood higher or sloped more to the west Till is scanty on the Archaean area but more plentiful on the sandstone plain Rugged moraines are found further south west like Duck and Riding mountains in Manitoba The most interesting drift hills of the region are steep narrow ridges half a mile or more in length averaging 120 feet in height standing parallel to the line of glacial motion and rounding down gently at both ends Unlike drumlins they con sist of unassorted rock flour mixed with boulders and they all lie on the floors of large postglacial lakes now drain ed They are explained as deposits in quiet water oc cupying ice gorges and Tyrell calls them AuJGUST 20 1897N S VOL VI No 138 ispatinows the Cree work for a conspicu ous hill They seem to be similar to the paha described by McGee in Iowa The prefix  Hyper  is used with the name of ex isting lakes to indicate their glacial expan sion to greater height and area SENECA COUNTY N Y THE Annual Report of the State Geolo gist of New York for 1894 lately re ceived contains an account of Seneca county by D F Lincoln The north ern part of the county includes a part of the Ontario plain varied chiefly by long narrow drumlins Southward from the plain a gradual ascent is made to the up land here dissected by the deep subparallel troughs of Cayuga and Seneca lakes Near the southern border great flat hills rise several hundred feet above the upland these being outliers of Portage strata from the higher Allegheny plateau further south The slope from the upland into the lake troughs is notably smooth being furrowed only by postglacial ravines in which cliffs and falls are picturesquely developed but in preglacial time the slopes must have been more furrowed inasmuch as several side valleys now appear to be obliterated by drift filling DRAINAGE MAP OF RHODE ISLAND THE 18th Annual Report of the Rhode Island Board of Health contains a contour map of the drainage areas on a scale of four miles to an inch based on the topo graphical State map and prepared by D W Hoyt The terminal moraine near the south coast forms a divide by which the Pawcatuck and its tributaries from among the hills are turned westward instead of flowing directly to the ocean It is noted that Moshassuck valley west of Provi vidence was probably the preglacial course of the Blackstone which now flows east of the city into the head of Narragansett bay The present course of the river is inter rupted by ledges furnishing water power that is actively employed at Valley Falls and Pawtucket the inferred preglacial course is obstructed by drift in which driven wells are supplied with water from a subterranean Blackstone POPOCATAPETL AND IXTACCIHUATL A SERIES of interesting and well illus trated observations on the two great Mexi can mountains by O C Farrington forms publication 18 of the Field Columbian Mu seum of Chicago Geol Series Vol I No 2 The upper cone of Popocatapetl clothed with sand and snow has a nearly uniform slope the middle portion is carved by numerous channels the lower portion is involved in the tortuous folds which make up the Sierra The summit crater is a pit 2000 feet in greater diameter 1300 feet in lesser diameter and from 800 to 1500 feet deep from whose walls of discordant lava beds and breccia rocks continually fall to the bottom The cumulus clouds that fre quently envelop the mountain flank in the afternoon are erroneously ascribed to cooling caused by snow Ixtaccihuatl is described as of more massive and uniform structure and without distinct crater as if the product of fissure erruption but as mention is made of lava beds on its flanks weathered to deep soil near the base and dissected into ragged spurs on the slopes it seems possible that long continued ero sion may be the chief cause of its unlike ness to volcanoes of more ordinary form The snow reservoirs near the summits sug gest the same conclusion WADIS OF TRIPOLI FURTHER notes on the Tripoli hill range by H S Cowper London Geogr Journ IX 1897 620638 contain among other items a number of illustrations and brief descriptions of the wadis that descend toward the Mediterranean coast They dissect the hill country emerging by gate 286 SCIENCESCIENCE like outlets in its northfacing escarpment and then traverse a sloping plain that de scends to a barren sandy strip before reach ing the sea They form the natural paths of travel by which the hill tribesmen al ways go to and from the coast W M DAVIS HARVARD UNIVERSITY CURRENT NOTES ON ANTHROPOLOGY STUDIES IN MAYAN HIEROGLYPHS IT is as agreeable as it is rare to find a sane student of the Mayan hieroglyphs For that reason among others it is pleasur able to mention several articles which have appeared lately from the pen of Mr Lewis W Gunckel of Dayton Ohio Two of these are in the American Anti quarian for the present year They are entitled The numeral signs in the Pa lenque tablets and An Analysis of the daysigns in the Palenquen inscriptions A third is in the American Anthropologist for May on The direction in which Mayan inscriptions should be read All of these indicate thorough investigation and calm judgment as well as a good acquaintance with what his predecessors in the field have accomplished The method pursued is scientific and the presentation of the re sults temperate Of course some of such results may have to be modified by future research and they may not be good in all cases that is in other parts of the field but the plan which Mr Gunckel has adopted of approaching these intricate problems is one sure to be productive of additions to our positive knowledge concerning them PRIMITIVE DECORATIVE ART FOR the analysis of primitive artmotives no paper has appeared for a long while more instructive than that by Dr Franz Boas in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History Vol IX en 287 titled  The decorative art of the Indians of the North Pacific Coast The tribes whom he has in view are celebrated for the abundance of their painting and sculpture their totem poles colored dishes and carved pipes and all are somewhat familiar with their strange and perplexing designs These are analyzed in the article referred to with masterly skill and the text is furnished with ample and accurate illustrations which enable the reader to follow the dem onstration step by step Certain general principles furnish the key to these primitive artmotives It was the aim of the artist to bring into promi nence the most specific feature of the animal he drew and yet to show as much of the whole of it as he could As he knew noth ing of perspective he resorted to the most curious devices to accomplish his aim He represented his subject in sections and dis tortions and sometimes by its specific feature reduced to a mere symbol as a beaver by its incisor teeth only Many of these devices belong to primitive art gen erally and hence this paper will efficiently aid the student in other fields than the Northwest Coast D  G BRINTON UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANrA SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS WE publish elsewhere a full report by the General Secretary of the Detroit meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Although the attendance was small the scientific programs were in many sections unusually strong and promise well for the fiuture of the Association A notable meeting on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Association next year at Boston with Pro fessor Putnam as President and Mr Howard as Permanent Secretary is assured WE are glad to be able to publish in this issue the address of the President of the British Association given on Wednesday of this week The addresses of the Presidents of the Sections AUGUST 20 1897

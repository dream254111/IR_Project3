OF THE MOST ANCIENT AND HONORABLE OF ALL CALLINGS FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL THE PRINCIPLE THAT A PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO SELECT ANOTHER TO PLEAD HIS CAUSE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED MANY OF THE GREAT ORATORS OF GREECE AND ROME THOUGH IN A MANNER DIFFERING FROM THAT OF MODERN TIMES PER FORMED THE FUNCTIONS OF ADVOCATES AND MANY OF THEIR MOST FA MOUS ORATIONS WERE COMPOSED FOR THAT PURPOSE THE INFLUENCE OF THE ADVOCATE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WAS SCARCELY LESS POTENT IN ANCIENT TIMES THAN IT IS AT PRESENT AMONG THE ANCIENT GREEKS IT WAS NOT CUSTOMARY FOR THE ADVO CATE ACTUALLY TO PLEAD THE CAUSE OF HIS CLIENT IN COURT THE USUAL CUSTOM WAS FOR THE CLIENT TO LAY HIS CASE BEFORE ONE OF THE GREAT ORATORS OR WRITERS OF THE DAY WHO WOULD THEN PREPARE AN ORATION WHICH THE CLIENT READ OR DELIVERED AT THE TRIAL REFERRING TO THIS ANCIENT PRACTICE JUDGE SHARSWOOD SAYS IN ALL COUNTRIES ADVANCED IN CIVILIZATION AND WHERE LAWS AND MANNERS HAVE ATTAINED ANY DEGREE OF REFINEMENT THERE HAS ARISEN AN ORDER OF ADVOCATES DEVOTED TO PROSECUTING OR DE FENDING THE LAWSUITS OF OTHERS BEFORE THE TRIBUNALS OF ATHENS ALTHOUGH THE PARTY PLEADED HIS OWN CAUSE IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE THE ORATION PREPARED BY ONE OF AN ORDER OF MEN DEVOTED TO THIS BUSINESS AND TO COMPENSATE HIM LIB ERALLY FOR HIS SKILL AND LEARNING MANY OF THE ORATIONS OF ISOCRATES WHICH HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN TO US ARE BUT PRI VATE PLEADINGS OF THIS CHARACTER HE IS SAID TO HAVE RE CEIVED ONE FEE OF TWENTY TALENTS ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF OUR MONEY FOR A SPEECH THAT HE WROTE FOR NI COCLES KING OF CYPRUS STILL FROM ALL THAT APPEARS THE COMPENSATION THUS RECEIVED WAS HONORARY OR GRATUITOUS MERELY 1 AMONG THE ROMANS ADVOCACY RECEIVED EVEN A WIDER RECOGNI TION THAN AMONG THE ANCIENT GREEKS DURING THE PERIOD OF THE REPUBLIC IT WAS THE PREROGATIVE OF THE ROMAN PATRICIAN TO REN DER ASSISTANCE AND AFFORD PROTECTION TO HIS DEPENDENTS AND EVEN 1 SHARSWOOD PRO1MSSIONAL ETHICS P 13726 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW TO OTHERS WHO SOUGHT HIS SERVICES AND ADVICE FOR THIS PURPOSE THEREFORE THE PATRICIAN FREQUENTLY APPEARED IN THE COURTS TO DE FEND THE CAUSE OF HIS CLIENT IN THIS WAY THERE GRADUALLY DEVEL OPED THE HIGHEST TYPE OF ROMAN ADVOCATETHE PATRONUS CAU SARUM OR PATRON OR IN MODEM PARLANCE THE BARRISTER AT THIS TIME THE PATRON CHARGED NO FEE FOR HIS SERVICES ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED IMPROPER FOR HIM TO ACCEPT AN HONORARIUM OR GRATUITY FROM THE CLIENT REFERRING TO ADVOCACY DURING THIS PERIOD MR ALEXANDER H ROBBINS IN HIS EXCELLENT TREATISE ON AMERICAN ADVOCACY GIVES THE FOLLOWING INTERESTING ACCOUNT THE PATRON WAS HELD IN VERY HIGH ESTEEM BUT THE PROFES SIONAL ADVOCATUS WAS CONSIDERED AT THAT TIME AS AN ABOMI NATION STATUTES WERE PASSED PROMINENT AMONG WHICH WAS THE CINCIAN LAW WHICH PROHIBITED THE ADVOCATE TO CHARGE OR RECEIVE ANY FEE FOR HIS SERVICES LATER IN THE ERA OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE THE CINCIAN LAW WAS IGNORED AND THE PROFESSIONAL ADVOCATUS RECEIVED PUBLIC REC OGNITION AND HIS QUALIFICATIONS DUTIES AND MANNER OF COM PENSATING HIM FOR HIS SERVICES WERE REGULATED BY STATUTE PROFESSIONAL ADVOCACY THEN ROSE TO AN HONORABLE CALLING AND GRADUALLY SUPPLANTED THE ANCIENT AND MORE DISTINCTLY HONORABLE RELATION OF PATRON AND CLIENT INTO ALL COUNTRIES THEREFORE WHERE THE CIVIL LAW HAS GONE THE ADVOCATUS HAS FOLLOWED AND HE IS STILL CALLED BY THAT NAME OR SOME DERIVA TIVE THEREFROM 2 IN THIS CONNECTION THE JURISCONSULT OR CONFIDENTIAL LEGAL AD VISOR OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE MAY ALSO BE MENTIONED THE JURIS CONSULT WAS PRESUMED TO BE THOROUGHLY VERSED IN THE LAW OF THE LAND AND HE FREQUENTLY APPEARED IN THE FORUM FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPARTING INFORMATION AND ADVICE BEING AN EXPERT IN THE SCIENCE OF THE LAW HIS OPINION WAS HIGHLY VALUED NOT ONLY BY PRIVATE PERSONS AS HIS CLIENTS BUT ALSO BY THE MAGISTRATES AD VOCATES AND OTHERS EMPLOYED IN ADMINISTERING JUSTICE REFER RING TO THE IMPORTANT POSITION OCCUPIED BY THE JURISCONSULT IT IS SAID IN GIBBONS DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 3

ABOVE THAT THE EARLY ROMAN LAWYERS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN DIVIDED INTO TWO GEN ERAL CLASSESTHE PATRONI CAUSARUM WHO CORRESPONDED SOMEWHAT TO THE MODERN BARRISTER AND THE JURIS CONSULTI OR COUNSELLORS WHOSE CHIEF FUNCTION WAS TO INTERPRET THE LAW AND TO ADVISE AL THOUGH IT NOWHERE APPEARS SO FAR AS THE WRITER HAS BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE TERM ADVACATUS WAS ORIGINALLY APPLIED TO THE PATRON OR TO THE JURISCONSULT YET THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE NO DOUBT THAT THE FORENSIC ORATORS AND JURISCONSULTS OF THE LATTER PERIOD OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC WHO FOLLOWED THE LAW AS A PROFESSION AND RECEIVED HONORARIA FOR THEIR SERVICES OCCUPIED A POSITION CLOSELY ANALOGOUS TO THE ADVOCATE OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THUS IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE PROFESSION IS OLDER THAN THE NAME 5 THERE APPEARS ALSO TO HAVE BEEN NO DISTINCT LINE OF DEMARCA TION BETWEEN THE TWO BRANCHES OF THE PROFESSION SUCH AS NOW EXISTS BETWEEN BARRISTERS AND SOLICITORS IN ENGLAND THE FUNC TIONS OF THE ORATOR AND JURISCONSSULT MIGHT BE

AND THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS LABORS AS ORATOR ADVOCATE CONSUL AUTHOR TEACHER PHILOSOPHER AND COMMUTATOR WAS SO PRODIGIOUS THAT HE STANDS WITHOUT A RIVAL AND IN SPITE OF HIS VACILLATIONS AND CONCEITS EVEN

OF LORD COKE THAT OUT OF THE OLD FIELDS COMNETH THE NEW CORN LIKE OURSELVES THESE ANCIENT LAWYERS OF ROME WERE BUT SHADOWS MOVING SWIFTLY IN THE SUN AND YET SUCH MEN AS CICERO CATO AND BRUTUS GAVE TO THOSE SHADOWS A CERTAIN REALITY OF SETTING THE EXAMPLE OF ASSOCIATING WITH THE LAW AND LETTERS AN ELO QUENCE AND NOBILITY AND UPRIGHTNESS OF PURPOSE WHICH HAS MADE THROUGH THE CENTURIES FOR THE STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS PURITY AND ELEVATION OF HUMANITY 9 TURNING TO A CONSIDERATION OF THE RISE OF ADVOCACY IN ENG LAND NOT A GREAT DEAL CAN BE SAID OF THE ANCIENT ORIGIN OF THE PRO FESSION IN THAT COUNTRY FOR MUCH OF IT IS HAZED IN UNCERTAINTY VERY EARLY IN THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND JUSTICE WAS CRUDELY AND ARBITRARILY ADMINISTERED THE VILLAGE MOOTS THE SHIRE COURTS AND IN FEUDAL TIMES THE BARONS

FRIENDS INTO COURT AND TO TAKE COUNSEL WITH THEM BEFORE HE SPEAKS    THEN SOMETIMES ONE OF MY FRIENDS WILL BE AL LOWED NOT MERELY TO PROMPT ME BUT EVEN TO SPEAK FOR ME  12 IT SEEMS THAT THE DUTIES OF ADVOCATE WERE AT FIRST PERFORMED BY THE PRIESTS OR MONKS WHICH MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT THEIR EDUCATIONAL ADVANTAGES WERE SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF ANY OTHER CLASS OF PERSONS3 LATER THESE LEGISTS AND DECRETISTS CONSTITUTED A PROFESSIONAL CLASS THEY HELD THEMSELVES OUT AS WILLING TO PLEAD THE CAUSES OF THOSE WHO WOULD PAY THEIR FEES THEY DID A LARGE BUSINESS FOR THE CLERGY OF THE

COUNTRY LOOKING FIRST TO THE COLONIAL PERIOD WE FIND THAT THE GROWTH DF THE PROFESSION WAS DURING THAT PERIOD REMARKABLY SLOW IN FACT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE ERA OF THE REVOLUTION THAT A REAL BAR DEGAN TO FORM ITSELF THERE WERE SEVERAL CAUSES FOR THIS26 IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WERE ORIGINALLY NO INDEPENDENT COURTS IN ANY OF THE COLONIES THE LEGISLATURES FIRST AND LATER THE OVERNORS AND THEIR DEPUTIES OR ASSISTANTS CONSTITUTED THE OURTS EVEN AFTER INDEPENDENT COURTS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED NEAR THE MIDDLE GF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THEY WERE COMPOSED IN THE MAIN OF LAYMEN AND WERE SUBJECT IN A LARGE MEASURE TO THE CONTROL OF THE ROYAL GOVERNORS IN SUCH A CONDITION OF THINGS ANYTHING LIKE A REAL PROFESSION OF LAW WAS A THING IM POSSIBLE A SECOND HINDRANCE TO THE GROWTH OF THE PROFESSION WAS THAT THE SOCALLED ATTORNEYS OF THE TIME WERE LOOKED UPON WITH SUSPICION AND HELD IN GENERAL ILL REPUTE SO WIDESPREAD WAS THE PREJUDICE AGAINST THEM THAT IN SOME OF THE COLONIES THEY WERE PROHIBITED FROM CHARGING OR RECEIVING FEES WHILE IN OTH ERS ALL PAID ATTORNEYS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COURTS ENTIRELY IN ALL OF THE COLONIES SEVERE RESTRICTIONS WERE IMPOSED IT SHOULD BE STATED HOWEVER IN JUSTICE TO THE PROFESSION OF THE PRESENT TIME THAT THE SOCALLED ATTORNEYS OF THE EARLY COLONIAL DAYS WERE NOT LAWYERS AT ALL BUT WERE VERY LARGELY TRADERS FACTORS LAND SPECULATORS AND LAYMEN OF CLEVER PENMANSHIP AND EASY VOLU BILITY WHOM PARTIES EMPLOYED TO APPEAR AND TALK FOR THEM IN THE COURTS27 AND DOUBTLESS MERITED THE LOW ESTEEM IN WHICH THEY WERE HELD A THIRD FACTOR THAT

HAD THE RIGHT TO ADOPT SUCH LAWS AND USAGES AS IT SAW FIT AND AS BEST SUITED ITS NEEDS IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WAS WELL ADVANCED THAT THE COMMON LAW BECAME GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS THE BASIS OF THE COLONIAL LAW A FOURTH CIRCUMSTANCE THAT TENDED TO RETARD THE GROWTH OF THE PROFESSION WAS THAT LAW AS A SCIENCE WAS IN SO RIGID A CONDI TION THAT IT FAILED TO TOUCH THE POPULAR LIFE THE COMMON LAW WAS STILL FEUDAL AND TYRANNICAL THE PEOPLE FELT THE RESTRICTIONS IT ENFORCED AND KNEW LITTLE OF THE LIBERTIES IT GUARANTEED 28 THE LAW WAS IN A LARGE DEGREE REMOVED FROM THE GENERAL MASSES OF THE PEOPLE AND THE RESULT WAS A NATURAL PREJUDICE AGAINST BOTH LAW AND LAWYERS IN THE FIFTH PLACE THE RELIGIOUS SECTS IN MANY OF THE COLONIES WERE INTOLERANT OF AND HOSTILE IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD LAWYERS LITIGATION OF ANY KIND WAS OPPOSED BY THE QUAKERS IN PENNSYL VANIA IN NEW ENGLAND ESPECIALLY THE CLERGY CONSTITUTED THE MOST INFLUENTIAL CLASS IN THE COMMUNITY AND BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH LAW AND LETTERS ALMOST COMPLETELY CONTROLLED THE COURTS IT WAS TO THEIR CLERGYMEN THAT THE COL ONISTS LOOKED TO GUIDE THEIR NEW GOVERNMENTS AND IN THEIR CLERGYMEN THEY BELIEVED LAY ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY AND PROPER FOR THEIR LAWFUL AND RIGHTEOUS GOVERNMENT IT FOLLOWED THERE FORE THAT THE WORD OF GOD PLAYED A GREATER PART IN THE PRAC TICE OF THE LAW THAN THE WORDS OF BRACTON LITTLETON OR COKE WHERE SUCH WAS THE CONDITION THERE WAS MORE NEED OF CLEVER CLERGYMEN THAN OF TRAINED LAWYERS 29 IN THE LAST PLACE THE SCARCITY OF LAW BOOKS AND THE LACK OF FA CILITIES FOR THE STUDY OF LAW TOGETHER WITH THE IGNORANCE OF THE JUDGES IN MOST OF THE COLONIES RENDERED IMPRACTICABLE NOT TO SAY IMPOSSIBLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTELLIGENT TRAINED AND EF FICIENT BAR SUCH WAS THE

COLONIAL LAWYERS WERE STUDENTS IN THE INNER AND MIDDLE TEM PLES IN LONDON    IN FACT IT MAY BE SAID WITHOUT EXAGGERATION THAT THE AMERICAN LAWYER OF THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WAS THE PRODUCT EITHER OF THE ENGLISH INNS OF COURT OR OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGESHARVARD YALE PRINCETON BROWN AND THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY AND IT WAS THIS SUPE RIOR TRAINING WHICH FITTED THE LAWYER OF THE EIGHTEENTH

THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY HAD BECOME THE LEADING MAN IN EVERY TOWN IN THE COUNTRY TAKING RANK WITH THE PARISH CLERGYMAN AND THE FAMILY DOC TOR 30 IT SHOULD BE STATED HERE THAT DURING THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE REVOLUTION A SOMEWHAT STRANGE SITUATION AROSE THE ANCIENT AVERSION FOR LAWYERS OR ATTORNEYS WAS REVIVED WITH SURPRISING SUDDENNESS THE SERVICES OF THE LAWYERS DURING THE ERA OF THE REVOLUTION APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN AND AGAIN THEY BECAME OBJECTS OF SUSPICION AND DISTRUST WHILE THERE WERE SEVERAL CONTRIBUTING CAUSES THIS SUDDEN REVULSION OF FEELING WAS PROBABLY DUE

STATEMENT THAT IT HAS NOT DEPARTED FROM THE TRA DITIONAL HIGH STANDARD OF THE PROFESSION THE AMERICAN LAWYER HAS HAD PECULIAR OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERVICE WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY TO FRAME A CONSTITUTION SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO BIND TO GETHER INTO ONE GOVERNMENT THIRTEEN INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN STATES YET SUFFICIENTLY ELASTIC TO PRESERVE THE ESSENTIAL RIGHTS OF THOSE STATES THIS DIFFICULT TASK NECESSARILY DEVOLVED LARGELY UPON THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND WELL WAS THIS DIFFICULT TASK PERFORMED MR GLADSTONE CHARACTERIZES OUR CONSTITUTION AS THE MOST WON DERFUL WORK EVER STRUCK OFF AT A GIVEN TIME BY THE BRAIN AND PUR POSE OF MAN AND MR BRYCE PERHAPS THE GREATEST MODERN AU THORITY ON CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS REFERS TO OUR GOVERNMENT AS WARREN HISTORY O0 THE AMERICAN BAR P 18ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADVOCACY 39 THE FIRST TRUE FEDERAL STATE FOUNDED ON A COMPLETE AND SCIENTIFIC BASIS NOT ONLY WAS THE ACTUAL FRAMING OF THE CONSTITUTION LARGELY THE WORK OF THE MASTER MINDS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION OF THAT PERIOD BUT IT WAS LARGELY THROUGH THE PROFESSIONS INFLUENCE THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION WAS SECURED AS WAS SAID BY HON WILLIAM L MARBURY IN AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE MARY LAND BAR ASSOCIATION IN 1911 BUT FOR THE PERSUASIVE LOGIC THE POWERFUL REASONING OF THE GREAT LAWYERS OF THE FEDERALIST IT MIGHT WELL BE DOUBTED WHETHER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1787 WOULD EVER HAVE BECOME THE LAW OF THE LAND LACK OF SPACE FORBIDS AN ATTEMPT TO TRACE EVEN IN OUTLINE THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN DIRECTING THE POLICIES BOTH IN TERNAL AND FOREIGN OF OUR GOVERNMENT OF THE TWENTYEIGHT PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES TWENTYONE HAVE BEEN LAWYERS TWENTYFIVE OF THE FIFTYSIX SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDE PENDENCE WERE LAWYERS AND OF THE FIFTYFIVE DELEGATES IN THE FED

CONGRESS IN THE LEGISLATURES OF THE STATES ON THE BENCH AND IN THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY THE INFLUENCE OF THE PROFESSION HAS BEEN FELT AND RECOGNIZED THE NAMES OF THOMAS JEFFERSON PATRICK HENRY ALEXANDER HAMILTON JAMES MADISON JOHN MARSHALL ANDREW JACKSON CALHOUN CLAY WEB STER KENT STORY AND A HOST OF OTHERS TOO NUMEROUS TO MEN TION ARE INDELIBLY IMPRESSED UPON THE MINDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGAIN IN SPEAKING OF THE EARLY AMERICAN LAWYER MR MARBURY SAYS THE PEOPLE OF HIS NEIGHBORHOOD OF HIS COUNTY OR OF HIS STATE AND AS HIS FAME INCREASED PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE COUN TRY LOOKED TO HIM FOR GUIDANCE AND ADVICE IN THEIR PUBLIC AFFAIRS AS WELL AS IN MATTERS MORE STRICTLY PERTAINING TO HIS PROFESSION WHILE HE WAS AT THE BAR HE WAS A LEADER OF PUB LIC OPINION AND WHEN HE WAS TRANSFERRED

GOVERNMENT 189440 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW DE TOCQUEVILLE THE KINDEST YET SHREWDEST CRITIC OF AMERI CAN DEMOCRACY PAYS THIS HIGH TRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN BAR THE PEOPLE HE SAID IN DEMOCRATIC STATES DO NOT MISTRUST THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION BECAUSE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN SERVING THE POPULAR CAUSE AND IT LIS TENS TO THEM WITHOUT IRRITATION BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ATTRIBUTE TO THEM ANY SINISTER DESIGNS REFERRING AGAIN TO THIS SUBJECT HE SAYS I AM NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH THE DEFECTS WHICH ARE IN HERENT IN THE CHARACTER OF THAT BODY OF MEN BUT WITHOUT THIS AD MIXTURE OF LAWYERLIKE SOBRIETY WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE I QUESTION WHETHER DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS COULD LONG BE MAIN TAINED AND I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT A REPUBLIC COULD SUBSIST AT THE PRESENT TIME IF THE INFLUENCE OF LAWYERS IN PUBLIC BUSINESS DID NOT INCREASE IN PROPORTION TO THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE 32 IN CONCLUSION WHAT OF THE LAWYER OF TODAY THIS IS A QUES TION THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE PROFESSION SHOULD ASK HIMSELF AND ASK HIMSELF EARNESTLY AND OFTEN WE OF THE PRES ENT GENERATION OF LAWYERS HAVE A PRICELESS HERITAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE RESTS UPON US A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY OUR HER ITAGE IS THE RECORD OF AN ANCIENT AND HONORABLE PROFESSION TO UPHOLD THAT RECORD IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY E W TIMBERLAKE JR WAKT FOREST COLLEGE 82 DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA VOL I PP 297298

of the most ancient and honorable of all callings From time immemorial the principle that a person has the right to select another to plead his cause has been recognized Many of the great orators of Greece and Rome though in a manner differing from that of modern times per formed the functions of advocates and many of their most fa mous orations were composed for that purpose The influence of the advocate in the administration of justice was scarcely less potent in ancient times than it is at present Among the ancient Greeks it was not customary for the advo cate actually to plead the cause of his client in court The usual custom was for the client to lay his case before one of the great orators or writers of the day who would then prepare an oration which the client read or delivered at the trial Referring to this ancient practice Judge Sharswood says In all countries advanced in civilization and where laws and manners have attained any degree of refinement there has arisen an order of advocates devoted to prosecuting or de fending the lawsuits of others Before the tribunals of Athens although the party pleaded his own cause it was usual to have the oration prepared by one of an order of men devoted to this business and to compensate him lib erally for his skill and learning Many of the orations of Isocrates which have been handed down to us are but pri vate pleadings of this character He is said to have re ceived one fee of twenty talents about eighteen thousand dollars of our money for a speech that he wrote for Ni cocles King of Cyprus Still from all that appears the compensation thus received was honorary or gratuitous merely 1 Among the Romans advocacy received even a wider recogni tion than among the ancient Greeks During the period of the Republic it was the prerogative of the Roman patrician to ren der assistance and afford protection to his dependents and even 1 SHARSWOOD PRO1MSSIONAL ETHiCS P 13726 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW to others who sought his services and advice For this purpose therefore the patrician frequently appeared in the courts to de fend the cause of his client In this way there gradually devel oped the highest type of Roman advocatethe patronus cau sarum or patron or in modem parlance the barrister At this time the patron charged no fee for his services although it was not considered improper for him to accept an honorarium or gratuity from the client Referring to advocacy during this period Mr Alexander H Robbins in his excellent treatise on American Advocacy gives the following interesting account The patron was held in very high esteem but the profes sional advocatus was considered at that time as an abomi nation Statutes were passed prominent among which was the Cincian Law which prohibited the advocate to charge or receive any fee for his services Later in the era of the Roman Empire the Cincian Law was ignored and the professional advocatus received public rec ognition and his qualifications duties and manner of com pensating him for his services were regulated by statute Professional advocacy then rose to an honorable calling and gradually supplanted the ancient and more distinctly honorable relation of patron and client Into all countries therefore where the civil law has gone the advocatus has followed and he is still called by that name or some deriva tive therefrom 2 In this connection the jurisconsult or confidential legal ad visor of the Roman people may also be mentioned The juris consult was presumed to be thoroughly versed in the law of the land and he frequently appeared in the Forum for the purpose of imparting information and advice Being an expert in the science of the law his opinion was highly valued not only by private persons as his clients but also by the magistrates ad vocates and others employed in administering justice Refer ring to the important position occupied by the jurisconsult it is said in Gibbons Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire 3 On the public days of market or assembly the masters of the art were seen walking in the Forum ready to impart the needful advice to the meanest of their fellow citizens ROBBINS AMtRICAN ADVOCACY P 3  Vol IV p 320ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADVOCACY 27 from whose votes on a future occasion they might solicit a grateful return As their years and honors increased they seated themselves at home on a chair or throne to expect with patient gravity the visits of their clients who at the dawn of day from the town and country began to thun der at their doors It will be observed from what has been said above that the early Roman lawyers appear to have been divided into two gen eral classesthe patroni causarum who corresponded somewhat to the modern barrister and the juris consulti or counsellors whose chief function was to interpret the law and to advise Al though it nowhere appears so far as the writer has been able to ascertain that the term advacatus was originally applied to the patron or to the jurisconsult yet there would seem to be no doubt that the forensic orators and jurisconsults of the latter period of the Roman Republic who followed the law as a profession and received honoraria for their services occupied a position closely analogous to the advocate of the present day and thus it has been said that the profession is older than the name 5 There appears also to have been no distinct line of demarca tion between the two branches of the profession such as now exists between barristers and solicitors in England The func tions of the orator and jurisconssult might be exercised sepa rately or might be united in the same person Thus Cicero speaks of his preceptor Scaevola one of the most eminent of Roman advocates as the most eloquent of the learned and the most learned of the eloquent6 It may be said in general of the early Roman lawyers that they were in no wise inferior to their modern successors in the profession They were learned in the law powerful in oratory and debate zealous in upholding the law of the land devoted to the interests of their clients and true to the finest ethics of their profession Among them are to be found such illustrious personages as Scaevola Marcus Antonius grandfather of Mark Antony Hortensius Marcellus Appius Claudius and his son 4 For an interesting account of lawyers of ancient Rome see Central Law Journal Vol

Marcus Licinius Crassus and Cicero It is interesting to note in this connection that Julius Caesar was not only a soldier but was also a learned lawyer and an orator of distinction In his argument before Cesar in defense of Li garius Cicero makes reference to the fact that I have pleaded many causes Caesar and some even with you as my coadjutor while you paved the way to your future honors by practice in the Forum7 It is stated by Tacitus also that Cxesar the Dictator was on a par with the greatest orators8 But Marcus Tullius Cicero was by far the greatest legal lumi nary of the Republic and the magnitude of his labors as orator advocate consul author teacher philosopher and commutator was so prodigious that he stands without a rival and in spite of his vacillations and conceits even after two thousand years the profession must bow in awe and reverence to this great name which heads the list of Roman lawyers the most eloquent of the sons of Romulus    It is true now as in the days of Lord Coke that out of the old fields comneth the new corn Like ourselves these ancient lawyers of Rome were but shadows moving swiftly in the sun and yet such men as Cicero Cato and Brutus gave to those shadows a certain reality of setting the example of associating with the law and letters an elo quence and nobility and uprightness of purpose which has made through the centuries for the straightforwardness purity and elevation of humanity 9 Turning to a consideration of the rise of advocacy in Eng land not a great deal can be said of the ancient origin of the pro fession in that country for much of it is hazed in uncertainty Very early in the history of England justice was crudely and arbitrarily administered The village moots the shire courts and in feudal times the barons

4ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADVOCACY 29 But even in this early period we find the principle of advocacy recognized at least in civil causes In the very old days a litigant is allowed to bring his friends into court and to take counsel with them before he speaks    Then sometimes one of my friends will be al lowed not merely to prompt me but even to speak for me  12 It seems that the duties of advocate were at first performed by the priests or monks which may be accounted for by reason of the fact that their educational advantages were superior to those of any other class of persons3 Later these legists and decretists constituted a professional class they held themselves out as willing to plead the causes of those who would pay their fees They did a large business for the clergy of the time were extremely litigious    And what we might call an ec clesiastical Bar had been formed 14 We are told by Blackstone in referring to this period that a great deal of dissatisfaction existed because of the clergys close adherence to the principles of the civil law The nation he says seems to have been divided into two parties the bishops and the clergy many of them foreigners who applied them selves wholly to the study of the civil and canon laws which now It was an early rule of the common law that persons accused of crime especially capital offenses must answer without counsel This defect in the English law was not completely remedied until 1836 In that year it was provided by statute that persons charged with the com mission of crime should be allowed to employ counsel to make their de fense and thus prisoners were placed on an equal footing with the prose cution MAITLAND AND MONTAGUE SKFTCH OV ENGLISH LEGAL HISTORY pp 95 176 MAITLAND AND MONTAGUE SKETCH O1 ENGLISH LEGAL

with and neither of them perhaps allowing the opposite system that real merit which is abundantly to be found in each 15 Whatever may have been the situation at the time referred to by Blackstone certain it is that at a comparatively early date laymen began to train themselves for performing the duties of advocates and later advocacy as a profession was limited to those especially trained for the purpose6 About the beginning of the fourteenth century certain law so cieties or associations which afterward came to be known as Inns of Court were organized these Inns of Court being given the exclusive power to extend a call to the bar and to pre scribe the qualifications of the advocate The Inns of Court or as they are usually termed the Common Law Inns are four in number Lincolns Inn the Middle Temple the Inner Tem ple and Grays Inn and their organization marks the beginning of the real history of the legal profession in England Just in what manner and by what process the Inns of Court declared by Ben Jonson to be the noblest nurseries of liberty and humanity in the Kingdom came to be formed cannot be stated with any degree of accuracy though various explanations have been given Mr Charles Warren says As gradually from the time of King John to Edward I the courts became localized at Westminster Hall in Lon don the lawyers gathered in that city from all parts of the Kingdom and formed a kind of University of their own in certain buildings called Inns where instruction was given in the principles of English Common Law and Statute Law exclusively Gradually Inns of Court came to signify the 15 BLACKSTONWS COMMENTARIES p 23 16 The early English lawyers in the main seem to have been ecclesias tics but about the year 1207 priests and persons in holy orders gen

probably existed in their present form in the reign of Edward III in 1327 Henry III had taken them under his special protection and in 1235 prohibited the study of law in any other place in London than the Inns of Court 18 Mr Thomas Leaming in A Philadelphia Lawyer in the London Courts gives the following interesting explanation The Inns of Court began their real existence about 1400 nearly contemporaneously with the Trade Guilds and both doubtless took their rise from the instinct of men engaged in a common occupation to combine for mutual protection All lawyers were once men in holy orders and the judges were bishops abbots and other church dignitaries but in the thirteenth century the clergy were forbidden to act in the courts and thereupon the students of the law gathered together and formed the Inns Much concerning their origin is obscure but the nucleus of each was doubtless the gravitation of scholars in some ancient hostelry there to profit by the teachings of a master lawyer of the dayjust as the modern London Club has its beginning in the con vivialities of a casual coffee house In time these loose ag gregations developed into strong and elaborate organizations which acquired extensive real property now of enormous value and have long wielded a powerful influence    Names great in the law in literature in state craft and in war are linked with each of these venerable es tablishments to record which would mean to review much of the history of England as well as of America 19 In addition to the Common Law Inns there were formerly  The term Inn or Inne was the Saxon equivalent for the French hostel signifying not a public place of entertainment but the private city or town mansion of a person of rank or wealth thus Lincolns Inn was the hostel of the Earl of Lincoln and leased to lawyers and students of law and the Inner and Middle Temple were the home of the Knights Templar WARREN HISTORY OP THE AMERICAN BAR p 27 Grays Inn probably

schools for young students or apprentices of the Inns of Court The Chancery Inns however gradually fell into dis use and disappeared altogether about the middle of the eigh teenth century20 The Inns

and has successfully passed his final tests under the supervision of the benchers of the Inns of Court he then receives his call to the bar2 Somewhat strangely to the American lawyer the legal pro fession in England has two divisions the barristers or advo cates proper and the solicitors formerly termed Solicitors in Chancery or what might be designated for lack of a better term as the business or office lawyers Both branches of the profession are of ancient origin but sprang from different sources and the line of demarcation between them has remained sharply drawn to the present time As already indicated the early English lawyers were ecclesi astics and there appear to have been two classes among them analogous to the present day barristers and solicitors The tribunals of the Church knew both the advocate who pleads on behalf of a client and the procurator or proc tor who represents his clients person and attends to his cause In course of time two groups similar to these grew up round  The several Chancery Inns as preparatory schools seem to have been attached to some one of the Inns of Court Thus Cliffords Inn Clements Inn and Lyons Inn were attached to the Inner Temple

and the pleader narrator or counter who answers to the ecclesiastical advocate    Under Edward I a process the details of which are still very obscure was initiated by the king which brought the professional attorneys under the control of the judges and began to secure a monopoly of practice to those who had been formally ordained to the ministry of the law About the same time it is that we begin to read of men climbing from the Bar to the Bench and about the same time it is that the judges are ceasing to be ecclesiastics 22 It seems clear therefore that as early as the reign of Edward I a legal profession composed of temporal lawyers had come into existence and that it consisted of two branches known re spectively as pleaders and attorneys It would seem to be a proper inference from what has been said above that the modern barrister occupies a position analo gous to that of the former ecclesiastical advocate and the solici tor to that of procurator or proctor It may be reasonably inferred also that the barristers are the successors of the for mer pleaders narrators or counters and the solicitors the successors of the former attorneys It should be noted in this connection that the earliest regu larly licensed advocates in England were known as sergeantsat law This class has however been superseded by the Kings Counsel whose duties and privileges are of a similar nature and the term sergeant has now become extinct23 MAITLAND AND MONTAGUM SK1TCH OF ENGLISH L1GAL HISTORY Pp 9396 BLACKSTONtS COMMENTARIES Book III P 25 2 Sergeantatlaw was formerly the highest rank to which an English advocate could attain The elevation then to the dignity of a sergeant was the great step forward in the profession It made the lawyer a member of the great gild which administered the law and it placed him almost on an equality with the bench The sergeants and the judges were brothers of the Order of the Coif To the end they addressed each other as such and lodged together at the Sergeants Inn We are not surprised to find that the creation of a judge was compared with the creation of a sergeant an informal affair HOLLINGSWORTn HISTORY OF ENGLISH LAW Vol II p 413 The origin of the Order of the Coif referred to above is not definitely known The generally accepted theory is that after the clergy were prohibited from practicing in the secular courts those of them who had

although their full official title seems to have been Servientes Domini Regis ad legem that is Servants at law of our lord the King Unlike all prior advocates they were part of the court itself were regularly appointed by royal patent were admitted only upon taking an oath had a monopoly of all practice and were directly amenable to the king as parts of his judicial system The fundamental ideas involved in the creation of this class have never been abandoned and not withstanding that the class itself by the name sergeants had ceased to exist they are still the distinguishing char acteristics of the bar of all countries where the common law prevails 24 It is beyond the scope of this paper to go into a full and de tailed discussion of the respective functions of barristers and the solicitorsthe present divisions of the legal profession in Eng land Suffice it to say the distinction is not recognized in this country the term attorneyatlaw covering the entire field of professional advocacy Indeed it may be accurately stated says Mr Robbins that the American lawyer is rather the Eng lish solicitor possessing however the professional rights and duties of the English barrister 25

country Looking first to the Colonial period we find that the growth Df the profession was during that period remarkably slow In fact it was not until the era of the Revolution that a real bar Degan to form itself There were several causes for this26 In the first place there were originally no independent courts in any of the Colonies The Legislatures first and later the overnors and their Deputies or Assistants constituted the ourts Even after independent courts had been established near the middle Gf the seventeenth century they were composed in the main of laymen and were subject in a large measure to the control of the Royal Governors In such a condition of things anything like a real profession of law was a thing im possible A second hindrance to the growth of the profession was that the socalled attorneys of the time were looked upon with suspicion and held in general ill repute So widespread was the prejudice against them that in some of the Colonies they were prohibited from charging or receiving fees while in oth ers all paid attorneys were excluded from the courts entirely In all of the Colonies severe restrictions were imposed It should be stated however in justice to the profession of the present time that the socalled attorneys of the early Colonial days were not lawyers at all but were very largely traders factors land speculators and laymen of clever penmanship and easy volu bility whom parties employed to appear and talk for them in the courts27 and doubtless merited the low esteem in which they were held A third factor that entered largely into the situation was the unsettled state of the law itself Whether or not the English Common Law was to be accepted as the law of the land was for functions see ROBBINS AMERICAN ADVOCACY chapter 1 See also a highly entertaining address entitled Our Brethren Overseas by Hon John W Davis former Ambassador to Great Britain delivered before the Ameri can Bar Association at

536 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW a considerable period of time an open question In some of the Colonies it was adopted at a comparatively early date while in others it was stoutly maintained that each Colony had the right to adopt such laws and usages as it saw fit and as best suited its needs It was not until the eighteenth century was well advanced that the Common Law became generally accepted as the basis of the Colonial law A fourth circumstance that tended to retard the growth of the profession was that law as a science was in so rigid a condi tion that it failed to touch the popular life The Common Law was still feudal and tyrannical The people felt the restrictions it enforced and knew little of the liberties it guaranteed 28 The law was in a large degree removed from the general masses of the people and the result was a natural prejudice against both law and lawyers In the fifth place the religious sects in many of the Colonies were intolerant of and hostile in their attitude toward lawyers Litigation of any kind was opposed by the Quakers in Pennsyl vania In New England especially the clergy constituted the most influential class in the community and by virtue of their superior knowledge of both law and letters almost completely controlled the courts It was to their clergymen that the Col onists looked to guide their new governments and in their clergymen they believed lay all that was necessary and proper for their lawful and righteous government It followed there fore that the Word of God played a greater part in the prac tice of the law than the words of Bracton Littleton or Coke Where such was the condition there was more need of clever clergymen than of trained lawyers 29 In the last place the scarcity of law books and the lack of fa cilities for the study of law together with the ignorance of the judges in most of the Colonies rendered impracticable not to say impossible the development of an intelligent trained and ef ficient bar Such was the situation at the close of the seventeenth century With the ushering of the eighteenth century however changes WARREN HISTORY 0o THE AMERICAN BAR p 5 WARREN HISTORY O11 THr AMERICAN BAR P 7ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADVOCACY 37 favorable to the growth of a real profession of law began to oc cur The American Colonies had become a reality and were no longer an experiment The Colonies were growing in wealth and properity Institutions of learning were founded and means of education provided The Boston News Letter the first Colonial newspaper was published in 1704 In 1753 a penny post was established by Benjamin Franklin who was at that time filling the office of Deputy Postmaster General for the Colonies which office with headquarters in New York had been created by Act of Parliament in 1704 Commerce was being extended and business transactions that required the services of real lawyers were multiplying rapidly The Royal Governors the King and Parliament were encroaching more and more upon what the Colonists were beginning to recognize and to assert as their rights under the English Common Law Va rious new questions were arising in the courts which necessi tated a resort to the Common Law for precedents upon which to base decisions The necessity for trained and skilled lawyers had arisen About this time barristers from England began to come into the Colonies and men of education and culture in the Colonies began to enter the law as a profession Sharp practitioners and persons of low merit were excluded from the practice through the agency of bar associations and thus the profession rose to a position of dignity and importance in every community An other very potent influence in elevating its standard and in de veloping an able bar was the fortunate growth of a class of Co lonial lawyers who went to England and obtained their legal training in those venerable institutionsthe Inns of Court It is estimated that from 1750 to 1775 nearly a hundred and fifty Colonial lawyers were students in the Inner and Middle Tem ples in London    In fact it may be said without exaggeration that the American lawyer of the late Eighteenth Century was the product either of the English Inns of Court or of the American collegesHarvard Yale Princeton Brown and the College of William and Mary And it was this supe rior training which fitted the lawyer of the Eighteenth Cen tury to become the spokesman the writer and the orator of38 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW the people when the people were forced to look for cham pions against the pretensions of the Royal Governors and judges and of the British Parliament So that when the War of the Revolution broke out the lawyer from being an object of contempt to restrain whom restrictive legisla tion was yearly necessary during the Seventeenth Century had become the leading man in every town in the country taking rank with the parish clergyman and the family doc tor 30 It should be stated here that during the period immediately following the Revolution a somewhat strange situation arose The ancient aversion for lawyers or attorneys was revived with surprising suddenness The services of the lawyers during the era of the Revolution appear to have been forgotten and again they became objects of suspicion and distrust While there were several contributing causes this sudden revulsion of feeling was probably due in the main to a not unnatural prejudice against the Common Law and all things British Fortunately however this antipathy after the lapse of a few years passed away and was gradually lost in the recognition by the people of the real value of the courts and in the further recognition of the necessity for a profession composed of members of character training and talent who as officers of the Court are essential in the administration of justice It may be said by way of general observation that the part that the American Bar has had in making this great country of ours justifies the statement that it has not departed from the tra ditional high standard of the profession The American lawyer has had peculiar opportunities for service When it became necessary to frame a constitution sufficiently strong to bind to gether into one government thirteen independent and sovereign States yet sufficiently elastic to preserve the essential rights of those States this difficult task necessarily devolved largely upon the legal profession And well was this difficult task performed Mr Gladstone characterizes our Constitution as the most won derful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and pur pose of man and Mr Bryce perhaps the greatest modern au thority on constitutional questions refers to our government as WARREN HISTORY O0 THE AMERICAN BAR P 18ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADVOCACY 39 the first true federal state founded on a complete and scientific basis Not only was the actual framing of the Constitution largely the work of the master minds of the legal profession of that period but it was largely through the professions influence that the adoption of the Constitution was secured As was said by Hon William L Marbury in an address before the Mary land Bar Association in 1911 but for the persuasive logic the powerful reasoning of the great lawyers of the Federalist it might well be doubted whether the Constitution of 1787 would ever have become the law of the land Lack of space forbids an attempt to trace even in outline the influence of the legal profession in directing the policies both in ternal and foreign of our government Of the twentyeight Presidents of the United States twentyone have been lawyers twentyfive of the fiftysix Signers of the Declaration of Inde pendence were lawyers and of the fiftyfive delegates in the Fed

Congress in the legislatures of the States on the Bench and in the life of the community the influence of the profession has been felt and recognized The names of Thomas Jefferson Patrick Henry Alexander Hamilton James Madison John Marshall Andrew Jackson Calhoun Clay Web ster Kent Story and a host of others too numerous to men tion are indelibly impressed upon the minds of the American people Again in speaking of the early American lawyer Mr Marbury says The people of his neighborhood of his county or of his State and as his fame increased people of the whole coun try looked to him for guidance and advice in their public affairs as well as in matters more strictly pertaining to his profession While he was at the bar he was a leader of pub lic opinion and when he was transferred

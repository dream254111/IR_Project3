j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1013882,Control of Railroads after the War,i242664,CONTROL OF RAILROADS AFTER THE WAR HENRY A PALMER It might be asked why it should be assumed that there will be or should be a change after the war in the plan of railroad control in effect before the war In other words in what manner has the warwhich has caused a temporary change to government opera tion to meet a serious emergency but for that emergency only made it incumbent on the country to revise its method of regulating the common carriers Most certainly it does not follow that merely because there has been a change in methods to meet war conditions there should be a permanent change But just as cer tainly it is true that the exigencies of war have emphasized some of the weaknesses in our methods of regulation and that it would be folly not to cure them now that they have been so plainly exposed And just as certainly it is true that the necessary war operation of the railroads by the government has demonstrated methods by which efficiency may be increased through their permanent applica tion and not to take advantage of this knowledge would be equally foolish So not as a natural consequence but merely because we have already learned many ways in which our handling of the trans portation problem may be improved and will doubtless learn many more before the war is over it does follow that after the war when the railroads are returned as they should be to their owners there must be some revision in the machinery by which they are regulated this both for their own benefit and that of the shipping public No one ought to attempt to say now with any degree of exact ness what the afterthewar method should be We are going through a historic period in railroad regulation and the experiment of government operation is as yet too new to justify any definite attempt at permanent application of the lessons learnedat least as long as there is so little prospect of an early end to the course of study Whether we agree with what the government has done or not it is done and government operation will continue to the end of the war We have all that time for observation and considera tion as to what should be done when peace comes Within a cer 131THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY tain definite period after the end of the war government operation should cease and railroad control should automatically revert to the owners of the property Then we should be prepared to enact within that period well considered thoroughly scientific railroad regulation legislation based not only on what was known before the war but also on what we have learned while the war was in progress OPINIONS REGARDING PUBLIC POLICY AFTER WAR If government operation of the railroads during the war for the purpose for which they were taken over is a successas it ought o be and doubtless will bethere will be a great cry for government ownership Already the preliminary notes have been heard Of course it does not at all follow that because the government with the autocratic power given to the Director General of Railways in a war emergency can accomplish what the carriers themselves hampered by law and custom and regard for the rights and comforts of their pa trons as well as for their own profits could not accomplish govern ment ownership would be the proper nostrum The arguments for and against such ownership are too well known to be entered into here It is sufficient to say that the success of the government in accomplishing a war time task under war time powers at a cost of great sacrifice by commercial interests would not be a legitimate added argument in its favor while as an added argument against it is to be counted the fact that the government will hardly be in shape at the end of the war to assume such a huge financial burden As to whether there shall be some permanent plan of govern ment control or operation short of actual ownership but akin to the present war plan the question divides those who would put into effect a noncompetitive system under government auspices from those who see no reason because we have had a war that the busi ness methods of private ownership should not in general continue to govern No one can dispute of course that if the government owned or controlled all the railroads and would work out and enforce an efficient plan millions of dollars in duplicate salaries duplicate trains duplicate rents duplicate service and facilities of all kinds could be saved But they could also be saved if the government operated all the grocery stores or all the coal mines or all the churches We may some time reach that Utopia but the time is 132CONTROL OF RAILROADS AFTER THE WAR not yet either through government ownership or any other form of paternalism NEEDED REFORMS IN RAILROAD REGULATION Let us lay down then as the first general principle of the new system of regulation that the railroads are to remain in private ownership but with the added degree of government control that is necessary to the fair accomplishment of some of the reforms that seem to be wise As the second let us say that all laws that have hampered them in efficiency are to be repealed or amended so that though injustice may not be done the carriers will still be able to do things dictated by good business judgment which they are now prevented from doing As the third let us say that as far as possi ble or wise all things considered the railroads shall be compelled by law to do the things that have been demonstrated as efficient for them to do but which of their own will they have refrained from doing In other words let the railroads continue to operate under the same general plan of private control and ownership as before the war with more liberality toward them as to the things they are per mitted to do and greater strictness as to things they are compelled to dowhich carries with it the idea of greater powers in some regu latory body though those powers would be used for the carriers benefit as well as for the repression of any improper desires on their part To start with let us do away with the multiplicity of regulat ing bodies the celebrated fortynine masters and center the regulat ing power in one federal body the Interstate Commerce Commis sion Let us do away with the state commissions as railway regu lators except as they may continue to exercise mere police powers and possibly as they may continue to regulate railways that are purely intrastate There are those who say this is not legally pos sible but there are others who say it is But so far as it is legally possible it should be done and every effort should be made to deter mine its legal possibility It is ridiculous and highly productive of inefficiency and unfairness that for instance a train must have one kind of crew in one state and a different kind in another or that the fare should be fixed at one rate in one state and at a dif ferent rate in another both perhaps varying from the interstate rate The railroads whatever their paper form of organization or what 133THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ever the rights of states to regulate them are a national system in reality and in so far as they are not permitted or compelled to oper ate as such they must fall short in efficiency It is true that this doctrine is shocking to some as an attempt to invade the sanctity of socalled state rights But there is noth ing sacred about the theory of state rights or any other political theory If it does not hold water it should be cast aside And besides there are those of no small ability and legal lore who hold that the doctrine of state rights is not incompatible with centralized federal regulation of railroadsindeed that the two go hand in hand in that the real and highest right of a state is to be protected from discrimination by reason of the act of another state These are questions for the lawyers but they should be threshed out with a view to constructing an efficient system There must be a more definite government policy with respect to the revenue railroads are allowed to earn As things are now the Interstate Commerce Commission regulates ratesand the rate regulating power should remain in that body war or no war but there is always dispute and never certainty as to just how far the Commission may use its judgment in deciding whether the reve nues of the carriers are sufficient The inclination in the absence of a definite declaration by Congress on the subject is to confine consideration to the questions of reasonableness and discrimina tion There should perhaps be fixed a minimum net return Even with such a provision we should be confronted by the vexed question of whether a certain general increase which the weak roads need should be allowed when it would swell the revenue of the more prosperous roads to unreasonable proportions This brings us to the subject of the pooling of traffic and revenues now illegal It should be made legal within certain limits The stock holders of a given road should have reasonable assurance that so long as the road was properly operated and necessary at all in the scheme of things it would earn for them no less than a certain per centage of return It might earn as much more as good manage ment and general conditions warranted Such a plan to be sure unless carefully worked out might provide for the prosperous con tinuance of a road that really had no reason for living or for making money out of its existence There would have to be government participation in deciding whether a given road should share in the 134CONTROL OF RAILROADS AFTER THE WAR promise of minimum return and that power of participation would have to be wisely exercised The strict rule of the survival of the fit test cannot be applied to the railroad situation for the reason that we have to take things as they are and not as they might be if we could start from nothing to build a new transportation scheme Com munities and businesses have grown up on the basis of the present system They cannot be wiped out in the effort for absolute effi ciency The best that may be done is to empower an able com mission to handle the situation with due regard for all existing interests to the end that necessary roads may not perish for lack of revenue but that those more fortunately situated may contribute somewhat of their prosperity Doubtless repeal of the antipooling laws would accomplish all that is desired if the repealing act were accompanied by wise legislation safeguarding all interests The first essential is to determine the policy If it be the policy to enable our present railroads to continue to exist and that by means of some plan which shall operate to distribute profits somewhat more equit ably and at the same time bring greater facility in the handling of the countrys business by the pooling of traffic then the rest is com paratively easy a matter of detail Such a plan would not be solely nor even chiefly for the benefit of the carriers The shipping public would profit Rates would probably be no higher than they other wise would be and service would be better POOLING OF FACILITIES The pooling or common use of railroad facilities is already legal and was tried even before the government took over the roads with some degree of success by the eastern carriers It should be made compulsory within proper limits The purpose of transpor tation is to get freight and passengers moved and the reason for congestion is that they are not moved If we are to consider trans portation nationally there is no reason why a road possessing facili ties that will help in the moving of this traffic should not be com pelled to permit their use to the utmost by anybody that can use them for the necessary purpose provided of course that the rights of the owner to due compensation are protected It might be urged that if a given railroad knew that some facility it might builda new terminal for instancecould be used by any road that wished to use it it might refrain from building it But here the govern 135THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ment should take a hand When facilities are needed it should compel the railroads to provide them and there would be no hard ship or injustice in its doing so as long as it provided for the neces sary revenue The one great transportation lesson of this war is that the rail roads have not kept pace in the matter of rolling stock and terminal facilities with the growing needs of the country even aside from the war emergency They must be made to do so for in the sense that transportation is a commodity to which the public is entitled at reasonable rates the railroads cannot be operated as a private busi ness But they cannot be expected or even compelled to do so un less their income is sufficient to justify the necessary expenditures Rates and service to the public are coordinate questions and must be handled by the same authority in accordance with a well defined policy As a means of bringing about more expeditious loading and un loading of cars by shippers and consignees higher demurrage charges are being tried by order of the Director General of Railways and the Interstate Commerce Commission In so far as they achieve the object desired they are perfectly proper The question of propriety is merely one of efficacy There is as yet no scientific system of such charges for that purpose There should be one and now is the time to make the preliminary study SPEED IN MOVING FREIGHT But while penalizing the shipper and the consignee for failure to reach efficiency in their part of the transportation operation why not compel the carriers by some similar system of penalties to move freight more promptly No inconsiderable part of the delay resulting in demurrage is attributable to the faults of the car riers themselves Figures are easily obtainable showing the un reasonable time consumed in transit and the same is true with re gard to delays at terminals Daniel Willard president of the Bal timore and Ohio railroad has pointed out that 52 per cent of the time of a freight car is wasted around terminals and that it is mov ing on the road only 11 per cent of its time When from this 11 per cent is deducted the time wasted in slow movement the freight car as a medium of transportation does not make much of a showing Mr Willards statement was made last July Doubtless the 136CONTROL OF RAILROADS AFTER THE WAR showing was in great measure due to the tangle brought on by the war congestion but not all of it was thus due There is perhaps no greater field for improvement in transportation than in the move ment of freight cars and shippers complain greatly at being held up by the reformers as horrible examples when they know that the railroads themselves are at least as greatly to blame The govern ment by its authorized system of penalties compels or tries to com pel the shipper to be efficient It should exercise the same degree of compulsion toward the carrier There should be a clearer determination as to the rights and duties of carriers in the matter of embargo as to when an embargo may be declared and what notice shall be given both to other roads affected and to shippers The practice is loose and productive of much confusion and dissatisfaction A H Smith eastern assistant to the Director General recently instructed eastern roads to embargo consignees who do not unload cars promptly regardless of demurrage rules This is an order per haps necessary and proper under war operation if it is carried out under the direction of government authorities but there is nothing in law to prevent such an embargo at the will of the railroads in ordi nary times when in their opinion necessity requires it Probably there are few railroad men whose judgment could be depended on in a matter of that kind and even if the motive were admittedly proper the shipper is entitled to know that he has recourse and that his interests are protected Another result of war operation of the railroads has been the overriding of the law giving to the shipper the right to direct the routing of his freight It is certainly in the interest of efficiency that this be done though perhaps the Director General exceeded his legal power in doing it Perhaps the right ought permanently to be taken away by law within certain limits The shipper ought no doubt to be permitted to control delivery That is though freight should be sent by way of the route most likely to afford ex peditious movement and not by the route some persuasive agent has induced the shipper to select the shipper ought to be protected to the extent that the freight will be switched without cost to him to the road on which he has his place of business or sidetrack from the road which has been selected as the most expeditious route There should be provision for compulsory arbitration of wage 137138 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY demands which would carry with it a practically automatic increase in rates to meet the wage increase when such an increase is permitted or ordered by the government Another performance like the clubbing through Congress by the labor unions of the Adamson eighthour wage law leaving the railroads to find as best they may the money to meet the increase should be made impossible Still another reform that has been many times urged and gener ally overlooked apparently because it is held of comparatively slight importance is the giving to the shipper right to appeal from negative orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission Impor tant or not it is his right or should be and should be given him for the asking The less important it is the less trouble it would be to grant it There has been no attempt herein to outline any dogmatic plan for a reorganization of the plan of railroad control Not only is the future of the railroads uncertain but it is not altogether cer tain what that future should be The attempt has been merely to suggest some changes that would appear at this time to be wise

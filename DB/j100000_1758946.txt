barometric gradient just be fore produced by the centrifugal force urge the wind inwards to the middle of the storm The additional gradient therefore represents potential energy derived from the actual energy of the rotating winds and all ready to be transformed into actual energy again as soon as fiiction has destroyed some of the velocity of rotation The general interaction of the stormforces may now be thus summarized in obedience to a centripetal tendency produced by differ ences of temperature or of pressure or both the air moves along the surface to the region of low pressure On its way the deflective force arising from the earths rotation turns it con tinually to one side and so gives it a more and more nearly circular path and in addition to this its rotary velocity increases as much as its radius of rotation decreases the tangen tial component of its spiral motion must there fore continually increase With the increase of this component and the decrease of the radius of rotation the centrifugal force v r must increase rapidly and soon come to equal and counterbalance the original centripetal force and at the same time greatly increase the barometric gradients At this point the wind would blow in a circular path were it not that friction with the sea or ground is continually consuming some of its velocity and thus de creasing its centrifugal force and allowing the potential energy of the steep barometric gradi ent to produce centripetal motion This de creases its radius and at once gives it new life again to be partly destroyed and renewed as before Absolutely circular motion can there fore never be attained although it is approached very closely near the centre At sea where friction is small and in tropical latitudes where the strength of the storm is great the wind is unable to reach the stormcentre for when the distance from the centre is reduced to only five or ten miles the centrifugal force is so great and the winds course is so nearly circular that it is carried aloft by the updraught before it can enter noticeably farther the cen tral area is therefore left unprovided with vio lent winds and is generally a comparative calm known as the eye of the storm of which there will be more to say later The general form of the stormwinds spiral can be deduced from the preceding considerations The angle between the tangential component and the actual path of the wind which is called the inclination fig 11 will vary with the 731 relation of the circular and centripetal elements of the winds motion the tangent of the incli nation will equal the radial divided by the tan gential component hence in the outer part of the storm the inclination will be large and the wind will blow almost directly toward the stormcentre but nearer the centre the incli nation will become smaller and smaller and the wind will blow in a more and more nearly circular path It will also be understood that the upper winds less influenced by friction will near the centre have a greater velocity and a less inclination than the lower ones Moreover the inward gradient which they pro duce will be effective and important in urging along the slower surfacewinds in a manner better illustrated in a tornado where this action will be more fully described To be continued ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEETH IN THE LAMPREY THE teeth in the myxinoid fishes are quite different from those of other vertebrates and have hitherto been supposed to belong in an entirely different category Nothing has been known with regard to their development except a brief statement as to their mode of succes sion in Petromyzon by Professor Owen in his  Odontography The teeth of the lamprey are horny and of simple conical shape disposed concentrically in the domeshaped mouth Besides these there are horny lingual and palatal teeth The kindness of my friend Professor Benecke of Konigsberg who sent me a number of lam preys at the end of their metamorphosis fiom Ammocoetes has enabled me to follow out the development of these horny teeth with unex pected results for as far as the essential part of the process is concerned it differs but slight ly from the normal course of true dental devel opment There is first formed a low conical papilla of somewhat reticulate tissue belonging to the mesoblast mnp and continuous with the dermis which in this as in other verte brates is of mesoblastic origin Over this papilla the epiblast which lines the cavity of the mouth becomes extremely thick and con sists of very numerous layers of cells All of these layers can be continuously traced into the other epiblast of the mouth as well as that of the external skin In the stage here figured there may be seen immediately overlying the mesoblastic papilla a layer of epiblastic cells irregularly columnar and polygonal in shape eo These cells are the homologue of the DECEMBER 7 1883732 SCIE enamelorgan of the other vertebrates and originate in the same way So far at least the lamprey does not show an essentially dif ferent type of toothdevelopment from that known in other groups The cells of the  enamelorgan are rapidly proliferating and have thrown off from their outer surface a conical cap of cells 2d t which are flattened and which show an incip ient formation of pigment among them This hollow cone of cells is the rudiment of the youngest tooth which in the stage here de scribed is the second of the series Outside of the rudimentary tooth is a cone of polygo nal epiblastic cells several layers deep ie  and this is again followed by the first tooth now almost completely cornified and pigmented so that traces of cel  Itl har structure are     o but faintly discerni ble 1st t The g tip of this tooth has just penetrated the I j i skin of the mnouth   e and is elsewhere cov ered by the man3y  i 4 layered epiblast e We see therefore that the essential parts of the typical e   vertebrate tooth are  Zt  t i here present name i  e ly the

enamelorgan secretes no enamel but func tions as a sort of toothgland throwing off successive hollow cones of flattened and cor nified epiblastic cells The actual tooth of the lamprey is therefore not the homologue of the entire tooth of a selachian but simply of the enamelcap It is not difficult however to understand how the process seen in Petromyzon could be derived from that in the selachian In consequence of this change another dif ference arises as the papilla never ossifies or becomes protruded it is ino longer necessary that for every new tooth a new enamelorgan should be formed by budding from the old one so each enamelorgan is converted into a per manent toothgland functional throughout the life of the animal 1 N CE VOL II No 44 This view of the peculiarities of dental devel opment in Petromyzon implies of course that this group of fishes was derived from ancestors possessed of teeth of the ordinary or selachian type Further as it is now very generally admitted that teeth are only modified placoid scales it follows that the lampreys are de scended ultimately at least from forms pro vided with placoid scales Such a conclusion however does not by any means commit us to the view that the myxi noids are degenerate descendants of some gna thostomatous group as this is no more implied in the possession of ordinary calcareous teeth than in the presence of the horny teeth which the group has long been known to possess W B SCOTT Morphological laboratory Princeton NJ Nov 3 1883 NORDENSKIOLD ON THE INLAND ICE OF GREENLAND1 IN a series of letters to Mr Oscar Dickson Baron Nordenskiold has given a detailed report of the lead ing incidents and results of his recent expedition though it will still be some time ere we can learn what are the full gains to science The leading novelty of the expedition was of course the journey into the interior of Greenland After landing Dr Nathorst and his party at Waigatz Sound Nordenskiold went back to Egedesminde which he reached on June 29 The following day he left for Auleitsivik Fjord from which the expedi tion was to start He then proceeds  On July 1 the Sophia anchored in the bay We found here a splendid harbor with clay bottom some seven fathoms deep surrounded by gneiss rocks from six hundred to a thousand feet in height the sides of which are in some places covered with low but close shrubs or clothed with some species of willow mosses and lichen which when we arrived were ornamented with a quantity of magnificent blossoms From one of the slopes a torrent descended the temperature of which was 123

collect objects relating to the conditions of the country On the night of the 3d every thing was ready for a start and after some difficulty in reaching the spot where the baggage was we were fairly off The spot from which we set out on the journey was only five kilometres from the actual shore and situated below a little lake into which a number of glacier rivers fell We proceeded up the river in a Berton boat purchased in England On the night of the 4th we camped for the first time on the ice The expedition consisted of nine men besides myself After a great deal of hard work in getting the

preserved in memory or writing con stitute knowledge and systematic search for knowledge on the basis of the highest standards of learning is science This in its application being of the utmost utility constitutes the most important function of mankind A branch of science is a por tion of systematic research that extends to closely related phenomena and has become the special function of a definite class of qualified observers One of these branches is anthropology described by its principal promoter Broca as the natural history of the genus homo or more in detail as that science which has for its object the study of mankind as a whole in its parts and in its relation with the rest of nature2 In the light of today it may be defined more strictly as that portion of systematic research which deals with the differences Annual address of the president of the An thropological Society of Washington given under the auspices of the Washington Academy of Sci ences February 11 1908

and cultural differences in mankind in its epochs and its groups That part of the science which occupies itself with the body and its functions investigating their dif ferences causes modes of development and tendencies from mans beginning and among his present multiple groupsthe research in brief into mans organic and functional variationsis physical anthro pology The comparative element is the funda mental characteristic of anthropology and that which distinguishes it from allied branches of research It shows clearly the position of physical anthropology in rela tion to general human anatomy and physi ology and towards general biology The main objects of general human anatomy and physiology are the completion of knowledge regarding structure and its inseparable functions in the average man of the present day while the chief aims of general biology are to trace the structural and functional rela tions of the different species of living be ings to one another and search for the causes and processes of organic variation and evolution Physical anthropology is a continuation an extension of all these to the epochal racial other natural social and even pathological groupings of man kind and reaches with its investigations beyond man only so far as is necessary for understanding the phenomena which it encounters If it had not its present designation it could well be called ad vanced human anatomy and biology Physical anthropology is still a young branch of science though its roots lie far back in the development of human reflec tion It is interesting to know that the discovery of America with its new race of people was one of the main incentives to research in this line This was followed by discoveries of other lands and peoples in the Pacific and by slowly increasing knowledge of organized beings in general including the anthropoid apes All this aroused new thoughts in scientific men and doubts as to the correctness of the old the ories of creation and the fermentation in minds though greatly impeded by the power of dogma progressed until it finally began to pierce the cloud and manifest itself in publications Peyreres Pre adamites appeared in 1655 and notwith standing prohibitions and the small real worth of the book was received with eager ness and read very extensively In 1699 was published Tysons Comparative An atomy of Man and Monkey And in 1735 we see the actual foundation stone of mod ern anthropology laid by Linnaeus It was in Linnseuss Systema Nature  that man for the first time was placed in instead of outside the line of living beings in gen eral and that his close organic relation with the rest of the primates was authori tatively expressed Then came Buffon with whom the new branch of the natural science of man takes a more definite form and thence the progress towards anthro pology as differentiated today is continu ous The men who contributed towards its development are too numerous to mention they include all the prominent naturalists and anatomists of the latter half of the eighteenth and the first half of the nine teenth century such as Camper Lamarck Blumenbach Soemmering Lacepede Cuv ier Retzius the brothers Geoffroy Mor ton Lawrence Edwards Serres Pritchard and many others3 Even the teachings of 3For details concerning the history of anthro pology see T Bendyshe Mem Anthrop Soe Lon don Vol I

for they stimulated research regarding the variations of the head skull and brain and were the main incentive to Mortons remarkable work Crania Americana And the discus sions of the mono and polygenists par ticularly those of the nineteenth century were of great importance in this connec tion The first effort at some organization of forces in the new line was made as early as 1800 when a small body of scientific men formed themselves in Paris into a Society of Students of Man Societe des observateurs de 1homme It was in this little circle that the term anthropology used previously as a title for some works on man of philosophical and in a few instances of simple anatomical nature was employed in something like its present significance This attempt at organization was however premature and had to be given up two years later 1803 after but little had been accomplished In 1832 the Paris Museum of Natural History under the influence of Professor William Ed wards transformed its chair of anatomy into that of natural history of man and to this Serres in 1839 added anthropol ogy but the time was still not ripe for the subject to assume much importance From 1839 to 1848 Paris had a Society of Eth nology which included the physical branch again with but little result It was not until the commencement of the second half of the nineteenth century with the advent of Paul Broca and his collaborators and the foundation of the Paris Societe dan thropologie 1859 that the actual birth 1889 repr pp 119 F Boas SCIENCE Oct 21 1904 pp 513524 references to more or less direct

ago and how difficult the beginnings were even then will be appreciated from the following recently published4 details When permission to establish the society was sought the min ister of public instruction notwithstand ing the rank and fame of the men who with Broca applied for the sanction re fused to have anything to do with the matter He sent the petition to the prefect of police but the prefect was equally un willing and returned the document to the ministry as he received it It was not until after the influential intervention of Am broise Tardieu that one of the chiefs of the police department was persuaded the scien tific gentlemen in question were not quite as dangerous to the welfare of the empire or society as was suspected and not finding besides any law that forbade the gathering of less than twenty persons he informed the eighteen future anthropologists that their meetings would be tolerated But Broca was made responsible for anything that might be said at the meetings against the government or religion and every meet ing was to be attended by a plainly dressed officer From the establishment of the Societe danthropologie the progress of the new branch of research was more rapid Be fore long similar societies were organized in England Germany and other countries the publication of anthropological journals was commenced an efficient system of an thropometry with the required instru ments was devised principally by Broca and detailed instructions in the system were published by the same author col lections and important lines of research were begun in different parts of Europe and also in the United States and in 1876 was founded the Paris School of 4LEcole dAnthropologie de Paris 1876 1906 8vo Paris F Alcan 1907 35N S VOL XXVIII No 706 Anthropology for academic instruction and training in the new branch of science Finally in 1885 appeared Paul Topinards great textbook on anthropology the Ele ments danthropologie generale which to this day is an indispensable volume in our laboratories A long step was made dur ing this time in the differentiation of an thropology as a whole into its main sub divisions namely physical anthropology ethnology and archeology But this period of the first twentyfive years of anthropology as a separate branch of learning a period of the greatest activ ity the detailed and still unwritten history of which is of absorbing interest was not one of uninterrupted progress There was en countered above all a crisis which affected especially physical anthropology and from the effects of which it is only now begin ning to recover This crisis was the result of what may be called a schism in anthro pometry begun in 1874 by Ihering and completed in 1882 by the German anthro pologists at Frankfurt This is not the place for a discussion of the causes or de tails of the case it suffices to say that at the present time a commission composed of the foremost physical anthropologists of EuropeFrench German and from other countriesis endeavoring and with much success to select the best from the existing methods in anthropometry and bring about a muchneeded uniformity5 A complete agreement on this subject will be of the greatest importance and mark an epoch in our branch of learning This chapter necessarily superficial will be appropriately concluded with a 5For what has been

craniom6triques et c6phalom6triques LAnthropologie 1906 pp 559572 few words concerning the actual status of physical anthropology The subject like the whole history of this science calls for a thorough presentation but such is out of the question in an address of this nature Physical anthropology counts distin guished followers wherever science pro gresses it has already an extensive bibli ography of its own it maintains a number of wellequipped laboratories where stu dents are trained it possesses a large series of important collections of material for investigation it contributes the bulk of original matter to wellestablished anthro pological journals of high standing such as the Bulletins et Memoires de la Societe danthropologie de Paris the Archiv fiir Anthropologie the Zeitschrift fiir Mor phologie und Anthropologie Biometrica Man etc while numerous other results of investigation are being disseminated through periodicals devoted to anatomy general biology and to other subdivisions of anthropology finally it is a subject or a part of instruction in the Ecole dan thropologie in the Anthropological Insti tute of Zurich University in several large museums and in one or more of the prin cipal universities in almost all civilized countries6 It is still struggling with nu merous difficulties which retard it but unless development in science stops it has before it a wide and useful future II The questions are often asked by those For information regarding instruction in an thropology see J Ranke in Lexis 1896 p 117 W Waldeyer KorrBl d d Ges f Anthrop etc

branch of research what has physical anthropology accom plished and what are its aims for the future Both of these are weighty ques tions and deserve to be answered The amount of work actually done must be considered together with the obstacles that have stood in the way of fruitful investigation The greatest of these obstacles has been the imperfect state of anatomical knowledge which is the starting point of physical anthropology It is obvious that structural comparison extending to various groups of humanity can properly be carried on only on the basis of a thorough knowledge of structure in some one type of man preferably the white race Had anatomy been able to furnish such a foundation to physical an thropology the progress of the latter would have been immeasurably easier and more rapid As it was the new branch began to differentiate itself while general human anatomy was yet very imperfect and in consequence it was confronted with the tedious task of establishing or improving the basis for its future comparisons Thus a large portion of the work of anthropolo gists became and still is purely anatomical It is safe to say that fifty years ago when the Paris society of anthropology was founded there was not one point in any part of the human organism that was well known and understood Even at this day with all the excellent work accomplished there is not yet a single bone in the body and perhaps no other organ the knowledge of which together with that of its total range of variation is perfect and that even in the white race alone which has been most studied The splendid anatom ical textbooks of the day give little more than generalities The specialized litera ture is much richer but when one comes to details there are innumerable lacunae Yet details are today the essentials of all research and they are indispensable in an thropological comparisons It would al most seem from this that the birth of physical anthropology had been premature but if one stops to consider the deep in terest its problems have for humanity it is seen that its early rise even on the but partly prepared soil was natural The second great obstacle to the progress of physical anthropology has been the de fects in collections of needed material The third was the dearth of properly trained men and in the fourth place should be named the difficulties based on various prejudices or want of comprehension at tending the collection of accurate anthro pological data in many parts of the un civilized and even the civilized world Still further impediments attending this more than other branches of natural sci ence were those accompanying the elabora tion of the necessarily extensive series of data and especially their publication With regard to material what collections of value for physical anthropology were there half a century ago  Fair beginnings had been made by that time in a number of the European cities and one particu larly interesting one on this continent that of Morton in Philadelphia but all this was limited to crania and was useful in awakening suggestions rather than leading to definite conclusions It required years of assiduous collection and excavation be fore actual scientific work of any extent could anywhere be attempted Such col lection has been going on and there are now several great and many minor gather ings of identifiedmaterial incltding thome in the National and other American mu seums Yet even now we are far from the ideal in this direction or from cpllections which would include at least the bones of the whole skeleton and the brain and en able us to determine the complete range 37N S VOL XXVIII No 706 of variation in these parts of special im portance in at least the most significant groups of humanity What is required in this line will be clearer when it is appre ciated that to determine the total range of variation in a single long bone such as for instance the humerus in any partic ular group to be studied there are needed the remains of hundreds of individuals of one sex from that group As it is even the greatest collections fall still far short of the requirements and the investigations carried on with them can be seldom perfect or final The dearth of properly trained men has been a great hindrance in physical anthro pology The cause of this is simple enough The branch demands extensive preparation and arduous work for which it offers at best only moderate pecuniary reward It has not yet reached the stage of its ulti mate public utility and in consequence receives much less public recognition than the socalled applied sciences Under these circumstances the recruiting of regular workers of the right class is precarious a new physical anthropologist is almost an accident and the supply of students is far short of what is needed The difficulties of gathering the requisite material and even the data alone have been infinite and are still very great in fact they are sometimes quite insurmount able Religious beliefs and superstition but also love cover the dead body every where with a sacredness or awe which no man is willingly permitted to disturb It is not appreciated that the secured remains are guarded in the laboratory with the utmost care and for the most worthy ends including the benefit of the living The minds of the friends are only appre hensive of mutilation and sacrilege or simply fear the disturbance These conditions extend with small exceptions to the civilized and savage alike and to collect in their presence large sup plies of material indispensable to physical anthropology is often very arduous and unsatisfactory The impediment that this constitutes to the advance of the science is beyond computation And the difficulties extend even to the data on the living The stumbling blocks due to ignorance and superstition are particularly numerous in the way of measuring and are met with even among the otherwise most enlightened Compare with this the facilities of the zool ogist or botanist Notwithstanding these and other ob stacles among others those placed in its way by the illfitted or fool investigator physical anthropology has already accom plished considerable useful work It has established a system of precise measuring of man and his remains and has furnished the needed instruments it has directly advanced general anatomy particularly that of the skeletal system and brain of man and other primates and con tributed to zoology general biology and other natural sciences it has estab lished the physical knowledge of the races and many of their subdivisions and has aided through its activities the advance of its sister branches ethnology and arche ology it has given a farreaching impetus to search for the remains of early man and has determined the physical characteristics of the finds made it has actuated and to a large extent carried out the study of mans development from his inception on ward it has brought about physical in vestigation and through this a vast im provement in our knowledge of the crim inal and other defective classes it has led directly to the practical systems of iden tification of criminals it has taken part in and promoted the studies in human hered ity variation degeneration and hybridity it has added to knowledge of the func tions and pathology of the human body and 38 SCIENCEJULY 10 1908 especially of the brain it has furthered vital statistics and it has already begun to assist other branches in pointing out on the basis of gained knowledge ways towards the safeguarding and improving of the human race This outline is neces sarily defective yet it will show that phys ical anthropology notwithstanding the many and great obstacles in its road has justified its separate existence and the decrees by which the French government pronounced it in 1864 and again in 1889 as a science of public utility The object of the final chapter of this address is to outline in a brief way and yet not too generally the future field and aims in a word the future programas it appears to the speakerof physical an thropology Could such a program be perfected it would itself mean an impor tant step forward7 The future activities of physical anthro pology must extend to its own body and means as well as to further research work proper the more extensive and efficient the former the more important and prompt will be the scientific results The main needswhich logically become the aimsof the anthropologists them selves include more regular and extended recruiting of their ranks a closer general unity and cooperation definite unifica tion and perfection of anthropometry in its whole range systematization of the methods of treating and recording of data the supply of fresh textbooks and ad vance towards strictly specialized period icals the compilation of a complete bibli ography relating to this branch of research and its continuation the generalizing of 7 See in this connection and for further refer ences to literature on this subject R Martins above cited paper on the  System of Physical Anthropology and Anthropological Bibliography information concerning collections of ma terial and the augmentation and improve ment of collections Recruiting with the right kind of men is very urgent It conditions further development of academic instruction and laboratory training it makes very de sirable the extension of lectures on phys ical anthropology to medical colleges but above all it necessitates financial resources from which scholarships could be offered to men to be trained in the laboratory and in the field and an improvement in the prospects of their employment with fair compensation after their preparatory stud ies and training have been completed The time required for the proper training of the physical anthropologist coupled with that needed for the acquisition of indis pensable experience extends over several years of postgraduate activity and as the men who are best prepared for such train ing and most likely to be interested are those who have completed a medical course these years of specialized training and work mean a real pecuniary loss which ought to be at least partly indemnified Until provision is made in this point it can not be expected that the requisite numbers of students will be attracted to and will specialize in physical anthropology And this applies particularly to this country where the prospects of the graduate in medicineas well as in other sciencesare brighter than in many parts of the old world The most suitable means of com pensation during the preparatory years would be scholarships continued with the right kind of men until they find positions The opportunities of employment for well trained anthropologists are not so few as one might be led to believe the principal problem is to augment the compensation so that it may correspond better to the needed preparation and with the prospects of a man as well trained had he followed SCIENCE 39N S VOL XXVIII No 706 another vocation such as that of the phy sician Closer unity and cooperation among physical anthropologists of different coun tries must always be one of our cherished aims and the same is true of the unifica tion and perfection of anthropometrical processes and standards as well as the methods of dealing with anthropometric data and their recording Concerning the latter the establishment of definite rules is still distant the whole subject being in the process of evolution One of the main questions accentuated especially since the establishment of the journal Biometrica relates to the employment and utility of higher mathematics in the analysis and presentation of the data A simple ex position of facts intelligible to every edu cated person carries with it so great an advantage to every branch of investiga tion and to the public as well that the matter of the extensive use of algebraic formulae in publication can not be passed over lightly It would be folly to oppose the legitimate use of higher mathematics which in special cases excel all other meth ods and may in fact be the only means by which to arrive at a solution of a given problem but when it comes to the presen tation of the results arrived at it can not be denied that the highmathematical meth od while finding special favor with some abstracts the subject from critical perusal by a large percentage of scientific men not to speak of others The whole matter de mands very careful attention A supply of uptodate textbooks is a pressing need It was twenty years ago that Topinards great handbook appeared and nothing has been produced since that would bring it up to date or replace it Yet a considerable advance has been made in every direction and the need of a thor ough presentation of the accumulated facts and changes is acute There is hope that the unification and precision of anthro pometric methods inaugurated two years ago at the Congress of Monaco will stimu late efforts in this direction An advance towards strictly specialized periodicals to be devoted exclusively to physical anthropology is merely an aim at a further step in differentiation such as is manifested in all other branches of re search after they have reached a certain stage of development It depends upon the strengthening of the ranks of the phys ical anthropologists The importance of complete and con tinued bibliographical record is evident enough to every student and author and is an aim calling for the earliest possible realization Beginnings in this line have already been made particularly with cur rent literature and more is promised but the movement calls for definite organiza tion and extension to the older publica tions Improvement in and generalization of information concerning collections in phys ical anthropology are highly desirable Such information furnished through periodically supplemented registers of ma terial by and to all institutions would greatly promote collaboration as well as the extent of research An additional pro cedure of much consequence would be the deposit of smaller collections in larger centers in each country where they could be better cared for and be more available Finally a matter of vital concern to physical anthropology is the augmentation and improvement of its collections It is necessary that these be supplemented in a more systematic manner than has been done hitherto and in all particulars There are needed much additional osseous material including all parts of the skele ton for racial and other group studies ample developmental series on which could be determined racial and other peculiarities 40 SCIENCESCIENCE in all stages of growth the largest possible acquisitions of skeletal remains from all the periods of peoples known the longest to history such as the Egyptians the Sem ites the Chinese for the ascertainment of physical variations in different localities in known time large collections of brains preserved by uniform methods for the study of gross minute and chemical dif ferences in that organ in definite groups of humanity and substantial series of at least the skeletal parts and brains of the anthropoid and other apes for purposes of comparison The existing material as well as that to be added should be held in the best possible condition regarding identification cleaning repairs and preser vation All these are conditions on the fulfilment of which further advance in physical anthropology depends directly Other objects needed at least in our great museums are series of specimens fit for exhibition for illustrating to the public the most interesting human variations and large gatherings of good photographs as well as accurate casts fit for both study and exhibition The above by no means exhausts what may be termed the internal wants and therefore aims of physical anthropology There still remain the very important ob jects of the virile development and ad vance of teaching the highest of our hopes namely the foundation of separate central institutes of physical anthropology like the Ecole danthropologie the forming of a special international association the con servation of original detailed data etc But these are largely matters of develop ment of the branch dependent on progress realized in the points before specified and their discussion can be postponed This leads to the scientific aims proper of physical anthropology and these are in numerable They extend from questions of pure science and natural philosophy to those of high practical utility and from those of local interests to those of all hu manity I shall pass briefly over those of a more general nature and conclude with those that are more specially American The most urgent and important scientific object before physical anthropology is the gradual completionin collaboration with anatomists physiologists and even the chemistsof the study of the normal white man living under average conditions and of the complete range of his variations these facts to form a solid and sufficient basis for all comparisons This goal is still very distant notwithstanding the mass of work already accomplished It is neces sary to renew and extend the investigations on every feature every organ every func tion of the medium white man until these are known in every detail The facility and value of all comparative work will in crease in direct proportion to the degree of the consummation of efforts in this direc tion The choice of the white man for the standard is merely a matter of con venience the yellowbrown or black man would do equally as well if not better were he available The second task of physical anthropology is to perfect or aid in perfecting detailed knowledge of the structure function and chemical compositionwith their variations in the primates This field of investi gation may be regarded as the vestibule to the space occupied by mans natural his tory and is indispensable to the under standing of mans past and continued evolution collectively and in every partic ular The fossil forms of the primates must naturally be comprised with the living The third great duty of our science is the determination of development and vari ation in mans structure and also as far as possible in other organic qualitiespar ticularly thoseof chemical naturein rela 41 JULY 10 1908N S VOL XXVIII No 706 tion to time This comprises a delicate and thorough study of every specimen of man of geological and ample series of those of historical antiquity Research as to the bones of the geologically early man has been painstaking but the specimens them selves are still very limited in number and imperfect while the study of mans varia tions within the time of which there is closer and finally historical knowledge is still in its infancy The investigations here mentioned relate principally to the important phase of mans evolution as man The fourth leading object of physical anthropology is the study of the human races and their subdivisions This subject has attracted attention since the earliest time and contributions to the theme are numerous as well as important yet the road to go is still much longer than that already traveled The very term race awaits as yet a definition that would be univer sally adopted There are still immense territories in Asia Africa Oceania and America concerning the populations of which our knowledge is very rudimentary or wholly deficient and the subdivisions of the white race still offer a vast field for further investigation The apprecia tion of what remains to be done on the races and tribes of man impresses one forcibly with the fact that we are still only in the beginnings of this study and barely emerging from empiricism The future work in this special field must be more extensive systematized and critical Directly connected with racial studies but of more serious concern to many na tions are investigations into the effects on the progeny physical and potential of racial mixtures Mixture of races is a matter which can be brought largely under control through law and through general enlightenment In view of this a precise knowledge on the subject is a necessity and to furnish it must be one of the main aims of anthropology Next in sequence but not in impor tance are studies concerning the numerous environmental groups of humanityof groups developed and continuing under extremes of elevation climate and nourish ment or under the greatest specializations in clothing food occupation or habits that are liable to permanently affect the body or its functions All such conditions are followed by functional and structural ac commodations of the system and it is to be determined how they eventually affect the progeny Learning the exact facts in these lines is beset with great difficulties but the results are bound to be of much practical as well as scientific utility A still further extension of the studies takes up the pathological groups of man kind including the alcoholics epileptics insane idiots perverts and other defectives or degenerates and also criminals This part of anthropological research is already well advanced and has with the help of medical men accomplished much of im mediate benefit to society But the aims of scientific work in this direction a com plete knowledge of these classes are yet far from having been attained Their realization depends to a very large extent upon the perfect understanding of the normal contingent of the hunIan family Somewhat separate from all the preced ing are studies in human ontogeny or the development of the individual from birth onward in all divisions of mankind and under all specific conditions The con tributions to knowledge in this line have already been substantial though almost restricted to the whites One of the most interesting parts of this study will be that of mans decline in the different races and under various definite conditions Finally the ultimate aim of physical anthropology is to show on the basis of 42 SCIENCEJULY 10 1908 SCIENCE accumulated knowledge and together with other branches of research the tendencies of the future evolution of man and lay down indications for its possible regulation or improvement A few words in conclusion regarding the duties of physical anthropology in this country and in America in general American students ought to contribute as much as lies in their power to knowledge concerning the white race at large and of other peoples outside of this continent with its dependencies They have already added in no small degree to the study of child growth and should not stop in this direction they should also cooperate in all investigations concerning special environ mental and pathological groups of hu manity But there are several problems which will be to them of especial im portance and demand the bulk of their labor These are 1 The appearance of man in America 2 the composition and detailed characteristics with their com plete range of variation and the affinities of the indigenous race including the Eskimo 3 the crystallization of the new contingents of the white race in America particularly in the United States 4 the development of the negro element especially in this country and 5 the effects of the mixture of the white with the negro and the Indian Beside these range themselves parallel problems affect ing the insular possessions of the United States All these are scientifically as well as practically serious questions and re search into them deserves to be generally promoted There is no other branch of natural science which can occupy itself with them and define them they are the role of physical anthropology in this country and demand its development ALES HRDLICA U S NATIONAL MUSEUM THE HANOVER MEETING OF THE AMER ICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE AD VANCEMENT OF SCIENCE THE special summer meeting of the American Association for the Advance

committee with Dean Robert Fletcher as chairman and Professor H H Horne as secretary had made admirable arrange ments for the reception and entertainment of members and the college campus and buildings and the beautiful surrounding country were of even greater interest than had been anticipated The meeting was called to order at 8 PM on June 29 in the auditorium of Dart mouth Hall and an address of welcome was given by the acting president of the college Dr John King Lord who drew at tention to the large place science now has in the college curriculum as compared with the conditions when the college was founded some one hundred and forty years ago The president of the association Dr T C Chamberlin of the University of Chicago responded on behalf of the asso ciation and the visiting members IHe laid stress on the increasing use of the scien tific method in all subjects included in the college course and the importance of this movement for the future of society On Tuesday and Wednesday June 30 and July 1 Section B and Section E of the association held sessions for the read ing of scientific papers in conjunction with the American Physical Society and the Geological

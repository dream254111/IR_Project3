JAMES PRITCHETT Esq Communicated by W BLLAERT Esq FRGS Read December 13 1858 THE interest recently excited in Europe towards the Republic of Ecuador by the adjudication of 4531744 acres of select and valuable land to its foreign creditors may make the more accept able some data acquired during my residence of two years in that country Ecuador is situated on the west coast of South America between 2 north and 5 south latitude It is bounded on the north by New Granada on the east by Brazil on the south by Peru and on the west by the Pacific Ocean As the limits of the Republic were not exactly defined at the time of the separation of Old Columbia into the three Republics of Ecuador New rallada and Venezuela a mixed ommission being only then appointed for the purpose svhich has never acted and as both on the east and south the frontier is still in dispute with Brazil and Peru no accurate information can be given on this head further than that the latter boundary line is likely to be soon adjusted as the attention of the Governments has lately been drawn to the subject by theforeign creditors in consequence of the Peruvian Protest made in Quito against the Act of Adjudica tion referrel to A reference to the accompanying map will show the provincial divisions of the country as follows  Imbabura Pichincha Esme raldas SIanabi Leon Guayaquil Chimborazo Cuenca Loja and Oriellte It is naturally sectionized by two parallel chains of the Andes which traverse it from north to south The centre division being on an average level lnuch more elevated than the others possesses a most agreeable and tem perate climate rangin om 55 to 66 Fahr in the shade little subject to fogs and damp and has been wisely chosen as the site for the principal cities and towns of the Republic as well as for the large grain arld cattle farms for the supply of the coast and warmer districts The two other divisions on the east and west are covered almost entirely by dense and most luxuriant forest a 8 According to Villavicencio the Republic is divided into three Districts 1 Quito 2 Guayas  3 Azuaysubdivided as follows into Provinces The District of Quito comprises six ProvincesPichincha in the

which has been rescued from the dominion of the monkey and wild boar its present occupiers Guayaquil is the principal port where may be said to converge the whole commerce of the country and is a place of some activity It is situated at about 60 miles from the mouth of tlle river Guayas whlch flows illtO the Gulf of Guayaquil There azse but few foreign houses established here rrhe road to Quito the capital is only opell about six months of the year7 and is distant 80 leagues or 240 Englisll miles To reach Qllito the river is used for 50 to 65 miles according to the season whether wet or dry irl the latter to a point called Bodegas and the former as far as Sabanetta Such is the miserable state of the road and tlle limited number of animals available for the carringe of goods and producel particulally the forrner for the interior that at these points there is always an ex ess waiting in some cases for upwarl3 of twelve months beire they are forwarded to their destirsationX It may be inferred that as Quito as well as the other principal cities is sktuated between the ranges of the Cor dillera one of these ranges or chains has to be passed in approach ing it from Guayaquil The point over which our present route lies is close to the celebrated mountain of Chimborazo called CliuquipoyoS at about 101000 feet above the sea Iso arrive hereX a seres of lower moutains and ridges have been passed whieh after leavint the lower levels where the river is navigable presellt the most beautiful variety of form and colour and of an extellt that gives bundless room fcr every killd of atmospheric eect and beauty Before continuing this route to the capital it will be well to state that the principal trJbutary of the river Guayas is the Daule wllich unites witll the former a little above Guayaquil As the course of the Daule is not directly toward3the Gordillera its current is Iess rapid and its tributaries more numerous than they otherwise would be It is navigable fr launches and raft3 a long distance up alll its banks are consequently occupied with cocoaS coflee sugarcane and other plantations on account of the great facility of transporting their produce to the port In the ascent towards the side of Chimborazo is situated the town of Huaranda with a population said to be about 800 souls The traveller here changes the animals mules or horses he may have hired at Bodeaas for others wherewith to continue his journey At this town goods accumulate as mentioned at Bodegas on account of this being the station where the coastcarriers meet tlLlose from the interior and as the journey of the coast is morc easily accomplished than that of the Cordillera or from tc greater facilities between Bodegas and HuarandaS it will continue to be so VOL XXX F66 PRITCHETT S Ebrplordtiolls ilt EcuueYot It is only a personal experience of tlle state of the communica tion with the capital that can give an accurate idea of the enormous risks and difficulties attending the carrying on of the limited and almost totally undes7eloped comnerce of the coulltry but the warlts of the interior must be supplied aIld in return their own produce must be brolltht to the coast market and the true measure of such necessity can only be estimated by the knowledge of the accompanying difficulties Before arriving at Huaranda the fbrestvegetation of the lower levels has disappeared and undulating ground oif grain and pasture lands has taken its place About four hours rilinffl up a very precipitous ascent immediately after leaving Huaranda brings the traveller on to the high plain on which is situated at five leagues farther on the tambo or restingplace of Chuquipoyo This is the highest point of the road It is subject at some seasons to storms of wind and snow which entirely stop the traffic About five leagues beyond Chuquipoyo at a corlsiderably lower level is Mocha occupied like Huaranda by the owners of mules and horses for the traffic of the road Descending from AIocha at a distance of five leagues is situ ated in a warm rich valley the populous and busy town of Am bato surrounded by orchards and small farms and presentint the first specimen and perhaps the best of one of the communities of the interior Number of population from 9000 to 10000 The neighbouring land though arid and obliged to be cultivated by brrigation is very valuable Its weekly market is attended by numerous sellers of grain cattle baizes blankets ponchos shoes c of native growth and manufacture Ascending out of the valley of Ambato on to the plain which is arid and barren from which rises the active volcano of CotopaxiS at a distance of 21 miles the traveller next meets with the town of Latacunga the capital of the province of LeonS having the voleano in very dangerous proximity The population is about 16000 The valley of Latacunga lying norh and south has Cotopaxi in the chain of mourltains which brms its eastern boundary The western chain contains no mountain of celebrity The valley is 12 leagues in length dotted over with numerous villages the principal of mrhich is Saquisili celebrated for its woollen manuic tures and the industry and energy of its inhabitants At the northern extremity of the valley the road passes over a kind of connecting link between the two chains which form its easterll and western boundaries The breadth of this link is four leagues and on descending into the next valley7 at the head of which is the extinct volcano of Pichincha a very diSerent prospect gratifies the eye of the traveller frorn that aSorded him in the1ITCHETTs Exlloratio72s i9t Esuaelor CT arid valley of Latacanga The scene before him now is one of pastoral beauty the bright green of the rich pastures is dottel over with cattle of every kind and with the occasional large white farmbuildings and dwellings of the diffierent estates It may be imagined that such a scene set in a fralne of bold and beautifully tinted mountains which momentarily vary as the clouds about theln change their positions is solnewhat calculated to repay tlle traveller for the hard farc he has latelv experienced 11 the side of Pchinclla is situated the metropolis Quito our resent goallistant 8 leagues fiom mThere we entered the valley this point is called Tiopuyo Quito has some fine public buildings all of which are of the salne periodthe 16th century The cathedral occupies one side of the principal square Opposite to it is the Archbishopzs palace with private dwellings of modern and uniform architecture The Presidents palace occupies the third side and the fourth oppo site to the latter contains only private houses modern and uni form of three stories All the sides of the square with the excep tion of that of the cathedral have a colorsnade which serves as a promenade in wet weather A haildsome fountain occupies the centre of the square The churches are numerous and some of them with the most elaborate ornamentation of figures mouldings cornices of every possible design both in wood and stone The church of the Jesuits who were banished some few years lack is a more lnodern edifice Its irlterior is all gilt such is ti amourlt of carved work in it that the general effect is de stroyed otherwise the fbrm of the interior and the arrangement of tlle columus deserve a better fate The Convent alld Church of San Francisco occupy one side of tllc square d the same name They are raised above the level of the square and have a noble terrace in front from which oppo site to the church entrance descends a flight of stone steps into the square The buildints of the Franciscans occupy a space equal to four squares The Church of the Merced is quite an exception to the other ecclesiastical buillings of the city In thc first place in the orIla rnental parts of the building there is an entire absence of gilding rrhe buttresses and pilasters on which the arches rest show an immense deal of labour ill the representation of network which has beeIl sculptured on them and whicll has a good effect MThite being tlle pervading colour of the illterior gives a gool antl better tlistributed litht Thele are

halfcaste Indians and a few foreigners rhe atricultural populatioll is entirely Indian From the unevenness of the groulld no vehicles are used here but it is not just to lay the hlame of thls absellce of carriage3 to this cause as in the other cities of the country where the grounl is pelzfectly adapted for the use ol wheeled calriages tlle samc absence of them is obselved as in Quito Some other leason must therefore be sought and it will be found in the fact that tile ullskilled labour of the poor Indian can be obtained at the same cost or less than that of the horse or tlle ass and that the lacera tion of the backs of either biped or quadruped has not arred as yet at a degree to make the adoption of some otller more humane means of conveyance imperative The hith ground above the city affords a noble view of the surrounding coulltry and the numerous snow peaks and volcanoes that are thence visible The clearness of the air el3ables objects at the distance of 60 and 80 mile3 to be seen with wollderful dis tinctness Amorlg the snowpeaks are Cayanlbe Cotacaclle Cotopaxi Imbabura Tunguragua Sangay Illiniza and others lt has been seen how the capital has been reached from Guaya quilthat the high ridge of the Chimijorazo has been passel sub ject to the dangerous contingencies of snoxv arld storm when a drift might conceal in a few hours a11 traces of the weary traveller anl his still more jaded beast The first question therefore that wollld present itself to an explorer of such a country is what is the necessity for such a long and difficult route  lhis was the first question that it becarne my duty to investigate and with this object in view I determined on proceeding to the nearest loint of the coast the coast of Esmeraldas in search of a port that might be made available for the capital and whose distance was less than the present port of Guayaquil After passing some time in Quito in communication with the Government respecting the object of my visit I left the capital tc explore the nearest cGnvenierlt point of the coast which report had fixed upon as the most suitable place considered merely as a port and eligible considered as a point that might be easily con nected with the capital A commissioner being appointed by the Government to accompally me we proceeded to the city of lbarra the capital of the province of Imbabura 20 leagues rsortheast from Quito in order to collect provisions and Indians for a journey thatPRITUIIETT s Fylorations ill EcuacSo 69 would occupy three months through the forest to the coast where the necessaries of life were sollletimes not to be procured This occupied a fortnight The preparations being complete we com rilenced our journey from the city of Ibarra coastward Our course lay for several days parallel with the river Mira a broad rapid stream which is in some places the boundary between this re public and New Granada the level gradualy diminishing as we neared the coast The track we fbllowed lay through dense forest As we were going parallel with the Mira we had to cross all the streams which flow into it on our side of the river as well as the hills which form the ravines down which these tributary streams passed This was all uncleared forest without path or road of any de scription our ollly guide belng the river which we heard rushing over its stony bed on our right rhe descent to the coast is very gratlual and favourable to the formation of a cartroad That a road would be of the greatest benefit to the provinee of4 Imbabura nect not be asserted After eleven days of footjourneying we arrived at a point on the river Cachabi where we embarked in canoes and in four days reached the coast where is situated tlle village of La Tola In the year 1803 a Repoit was made by orler of tEle Killg of Spairl on the advantages to be derived by the opening of a road from the province of Quito to tlle port of La Tola in the imme elitlte neiglabourhootl of the Pclilonj as regards the trade of said province with the coast of Choco and Panama The Kilgg at tlle same time in order to encourage the transit of goods by this route allowel them to ellter the country free of duty besides other facilities favourable to the development of this province The Report made to the IVing was most favourable but his Maje3ty had matters of rreater importance to him to attend to nearer home and the road which was intended as a kind of base line for cleveloping the luxuriant province of Esmeraldas was never made The steps takell by the King were not entirely without effiect for the road has been opened to at least half wav but unfortu nately this was of almost no benefit for the road being incom plete the motive for traffic was not offiered and in a short tirne it became growll up and absorbed into the general forest A Isrench company has since endeavoured to obtain a contract with the Government for the construction of this line of road with stolle bridges and suitable for all the purposes of an active commerce for merely a small grant of land on each side of the road The Government of the day thought fit to decline entering upon the contract proposed and the consequence is the road to the coast of70 PRITCHETT S FJX7IOrAtWO2S in Ecuaclor Esmerallas remaiIls unmadc anl the irilportarlt ard lovely pro vince of Imbabura undeveloped Dr Villavicencio in his recent  Geography of the Ecuador9 says The province of Esmeraldas though most advantageously situated on the coast surrounded by rich woods of valllable tinlber for all useful and ornamental purposes with a soil from which tlle richest harvests may be gathered is in the most backmtard anal miserable condition attributable to thc want of means of foment ing its agriculture and also roads for the cheap transport of its products  If in spite of all these obstacles the plalltations of tobacco supply a considerable quantity for exportation what lnay not be expected when experienced settlers clear its woods multiply its plantations and take advantage of its maritime position its nav gable rivers and the ease with which these parts might be con ected with the rnost important of the cities of the interior   Of this part of the coast of Esmeraldas the rnost eligible point for a port is the harbour of the PailonS called in the survey made by Captain Ikellett of HBMS EIeaald  San Pedro This survey was made at the special request of the IJritish Minister then resident in Guayaquil It will be seen on the map 60 miles to the northeast of the river Esmeraldas  I now returlied through another part of the forest to Quito My next point of interest was the bark country lying between the province of Cuenca alld the river Amazons The point vve reachel on this occasion is called Gualaquiza about 30 leaglles from the city of Cuenca where lark is purchased from the Indians of the district who give it in exchange for trinkets alld other trifles A palm straw for making the fine hats as in Guayaquil is collected here To arrive at this point the eastern chain of the Andes had to be crossed On account of the trade that was gOillg on ill  The Pailon of San Pedro or St Peters Cauldron was surveyed by Captair Kellett of HMS Berclld A copy of the Survey nas presented to the Equatorian GoverIlment and this point being deemed eligible for trafflc the Legislature granted a Decree autho rizing the entry of foreign goods into the country at this port free of duty for a term of years The Pailon possesses man advantages over Guayaquil as a port for the metro polis inasmuch as it is at less than half the distance from the latter and would not have the drawback which the Guayaquil road suffers of being impassable for sis months of the year That this point would rapidly rise into importance cannot be doubted whell the quantity of rich and fertile lands of the neighbourhood and interior is consi dered the produce of which has to make the tedious journey round by Guayaquil to be there shipped for the markets of Chocd and Panama It would serve also as the outlet for tlle beautiful province of Imbabura and neighbouring provinces of New Granada which at preserlt have ne portPRITCHETT s Exploratio7as in Ecuador 71 this direction in bark it was practicable to make this journey with mules though with the greatest difficulty On returning to Juenca I proceeded to the coast to the port of Naranjal about 28 leagues by the usual road the imlninently dangerou3 character of hich I will not attempt to describe suffice it to say that the experience of its road accounts perfectly for the benighted and prejudiced state of this the most backward province of the republlc tIaving returned to Quit again by way of Guayaquil I left to examine the justly celebrated district of Canelos situated on the north side of the river Pastasa This river is navigable for 300 toss steamers to within 150 miles of Quito so thatJ it may be sail to be more accessible on the eastern or Amazonian side than by way of the Pacific On arriving at the little town of Banos the llearest to this part of the forest and located in the break which the great chaill of the Andes seems to suffer here I had the great pleasure of neeting with an English botanist Mr Richard Spruce who was on his way from the Amazons on which river he had been engaged in researches for many years I was the more gratified with meetinC this gentleman as he most kindly gave me some of his notes on the points I was about to visit The following are some of them Banos 5th llecember 1857Respecting climate he says  To speak more explicitly of the climate I may premise that in the months of Aprtl May and June 1857 I travelled from rarapoto in Peru lat 6i s by way of the rivers Huallaga Maranon Pastasa and Bombonaza to Banos in the Ecuador where I now write As I ncared the Equator I remarked as I had dene in ascending others of the northern tributaries of the Amazons what I may call the fusion of the wet and dry seasons Thus on the upper Rio Negro where I resided three years almost cn the actual Equator rare was the day all the year round which passed without more or less of bright sunshine and equally rare without rain The same seems to be the caw on the upper part of the river Bombonaza Canelos At the Indian village of Pacayacu which is reached in a day from Canelos I was kept waiting three weeks for peones and in this time made some observations on the climate of which the following is a brief abstract c rhe mornints generally broke clear and from 5i to 6 oclock AM the whole range of the Cordillera was visible from the volcano of Macas Sangay on the south to Cotopaxi on the north with tlle intermediate snowy summits of Los Altares Chimborazo and runguragua As the sun rose volumes of mist came rolling UI the vallcys fiom the east and speedily obscured both sun and lanalscale About 3 oclock the mist cleared away and thcD Sll1172 PRITCHETTS Explorativns isl Ecuaetor looked out bright and hot but the heat rarely became inconvenient even after midday At 3 PM we had a heavy shower but the evening was again clear and the view of the Cordillera more or less distinct Less frequently we had rain in the morning instead of the mist and then the afternoons were dry The temperature of the air during this period was delightful the minimum at 64 AM was generally 68 and until noon I could take vigorous exercise in the open air without being oppressed By heat The thermometer attailled its maximum at from 2 to 3 PM once it rose to 87 Fahr but more frequently it did not exceed 810 When there was rain in the morning the therulometer did not reach 80 throughout the day Gentle easterly breezes from 9 till the afterroon shower tempered the heat of the solar rays but we had nc violent winds although the village stands on all eleva tion 240 feet above the Bombona2a 6 A lnolqe important matter thall agreeable ternperature is healthiness of clixlat and you have 11ad ample exlverience of how one may travel the whole day through the forest of anelos soakel with rain alll sleep soundly at nightX protected from the damp ground by a few palmleaves strewn over it and from the niht dews by the rudest covering extemporized for the occasion  To speak now of the gold From my own observations and froon the trustworthy information of others I can confidently assert that the lower alluvial slopes of the Andes which gradually sub sile into the great Amazonian plain all contain yld from the sources of the Napo on the north to the Maranon above the Pongo de Manzeriche on the south perhaps nowhere in very gleat quantity but still amply sleffScielt to be worth the trouble of workinz7  In my voyage hither we betan to encounter beaches strewed with pebbles of granite and quartz at a little less than half way up the Bombonaza on the ridges and in the valleys the pebbles radually became larger and zuore numerous as we aseended arid were always accompanied by gold In fact throughout the Upper 130nlbonaza you can hardly scrape up the quartz gravel to the depth of a foot without encountering small fragments of gold Near those streams where gold is known to be most abundant the loose wet gravel extends to a great depth through this the larger pieces of gold percolate by their own weight and I have no doubt are to be found if searched for but as the Indians only wash the surface grarel scraling it up merely with their hands it is not to be wondered at that they rarely find a nugget  It would undoubtedly be worth while to explore the mountain Llanganate from the snows of which comes down the turbulent Tpo where rocks with qllartz veins and even blocks of pure qulrtz7 are copiously strewn The tradition tshat gold has beenPRITCHETT Explorations in Ecuaelor 73 got out of this mountain in the time of the Incas is so universally diffiused that it can hardly be altogether without foundation The wild Indians scattered through this part of the forest weave their cushmas long narrow ponchos ot cotton grown by thertlselves and they are stronger than the stoutest unbleached cotton I have seen in England  The shores of the Bombonaza about Pacayacu are at exactly the same height aboxe the sea 1500 ft as Tarapoto in Peru where all arborescent species of Gossypium is abundanty plallted alld yields a cotton of the strongest fibre I have seen in any part of the world No doubt this same species could be cultivated to any extent on the Bombonaza The other products of the forest are numerous and valuable fully justifying the opinion expressed by distinguished naturalists tllat it is the finest country in the world AIr Spruce has mentioned the mountain of Llangallate as worthy of exploration In it are the sollrces of the Curaray a tributary of the Napo the Bombonaza Topo Verde Shuna and many other rivers whose shcres show quarts and gold Dr Villavicencio mentions it in his recent Geography of the Ecuador Alluling to the Spaniard who became suddenly rich and who used to make various trips to this mountain he says rRwo reasons there are for suspecting that what is traditionally reported of this mountain is not entirely false  1st The tradition still exists of the Spaniard whose extraor dinary change of fortune surprised those who knew him in his povertfT and his continuous trips to Llanganate  2nd At the time of his death what motive could he have for falsely asserting that Llallganate contained immense riches and that his had been acquired there  We confess to a belief in his statement His confession was duly attested and registered in the archives of the city of Latacunga by order of the King of Spain who forwarded it there for the purpose Some years ao Dr James Taylor whose intimate acquaintance with Ecuador is the result of many years experience and who is at present resident in Riobamba 12 leagues from Banos wrote a memoir on the Eastern Goldfields of the Andes in which he expressed his opinion of their great importance and immense extent lJe wrote from personal experience Subsequent discoveries are now confirming what seemed then to be speculation anl surmise The gold of the Bombonaza is always accompanied with a very large quantity of black sand which according to the assay of the sample by Messrs Johnson of Hatton Garden is a valuable magnetic iron ore and if wood were close at hand to work it would produce a very fine quality of iron being quite devoid of sulphurous particles which iS the secret of the Swedish iron74 PRITClIETT S FzxpZorutiorzs in Ecuador Xhe break or opening in

the Amazons by this vcute contributing their share to the Pastasa which is among the largest of its tributaries The point on this river to which the navigation by steamers of 4 to 6 feet draught of water is practicable is about 50 miles below the town of Ballos and at a distance from Para at its mouth in long 50 w of 3000 milesfar exceeding the length of free navigation of any other known river At present there is a monthly line of Brazilian steamers of 500 to 1000 tons on the Amazons to a place called Ntauta within the limits of Ecuatlor nvhich serves entirely for the supply of the interior of Peru and for the transport of its produce to the AtlanticS which would otherwise be lost or valueless The manufacturers of Great BritainS it would seem could not fail to be interested in a country

energy and capital are being experlded in the irlterior of Africa in search of suitable sites for extending the produce of this most important element of manu facturing industry while the boundless fields of Canelos lie neglected and waste It would be well were it generally known how little 1 settler in so mild a climate as this has to go through before he is in possession of all the requisites of a eomfortable home In North America the hardships and privations of thc new comers are notorious and in many instanees very severe Attributable to the great ease with whieh the Indians supply themselves with provisions whether of fish from the rivers or game from the woodsf are the continual feuds and dissensions that exist between the different tribes It need not be merltioned that the Eeuador is the favourite field of botanists who do not allow the want of roads to be an obstacle to their researchesS for svhere the track ceases the ardour of the botanist incites him to eontinue his

whicll the British embassy to that empire has just retllrned was undertaken in pursuance of a policy of which this interesting event forms the concluding episode it was a source of great gratification to those engaged in it to feel that its geographical value was fully equal to its political import ance and that while enlployed in farthering the interests of Great Britain in this quarter they might also irlcidentally be the means of rendering some service to the great cause of geographical dis covery It is however to the naval officers upon whom the execution of this difficult and arduous enterprise devolved that the credit is due for having brought it to so complete and successful an issue It is scarcely too much to assert that the ascent for the first time of an unknown river for a distance of upwards of 600 miles from its mouth in a ship of 1300 tons and drawing 16 feet of water is an achievement which has never been surpassed in the annals of internal navigation or river exploration It is impossible to estimate too highly the skill and energy of Captain Sherard Osborn a valued Fellow of the Society or the unwearied assiduity and indefatigable exertions of the AIaster of the Furious BIr Court Doubtless the Arctic training of beth these officers stood them in good stead Of the services of Captain Osborn in the Arctic regions it is superfluous to speak of tir Court

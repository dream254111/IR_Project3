financial storm which has since passed into history as the i panic of I873  burst upon the country The depression which followed extended through the years I87478 During I879 matters began to improve throughout the country and this feeling soon became reflected through the rail roads In that year construction increased nearly I00 per cent oxrer the preceding year During these fifteen years there were built 858 I4 miles of nevv railroad an increase of over T22 per cent that is in the last fifteen years we built I5546 miles of railroad more than xve built in the preceding fortyfive years The first five of these fifteen compriseci a periodSof depression the next four years were wears of unexam pled activity while the three years of I883 1884 and I885 were years of hesitancy in which no new railroad enterprise of great magnitude was begun as was natural after the completion in a single year I882 of Ir600 miles of road In I886 there were built 8128 mlles and in I887 9984 mlles the latter surpassing the record of any previous wear and in 1888 7oZ8 miles In the three years the new construction aggregated 28I40 miles or within 58 miles of the extraordinary recorcl of the three years I 88 I83 The increase in mileage during the ten years from I840 to 185C was 6202 miles or 220 per cent The average mileage constructed per year in this decade equalled 6203 miles In the succeeding decade I850 to I860 2I605 miles were added an average of 2I605 miles per year the increase equalling nearly 240 per centQ The next ten years I860 to I870 showed an increase of only 73 per cent or 22296 miles the fallingoff from previous records be ing due to the outbreak of the war Between I870 and I880 45 375 miles were added an increase of nearly 86 per cent Since I880 57786 miles have been built Since the revival of railroal construction in 1879 there have been completed three adlitional through transcontinental railroads the Northern Pacific the Atlantic and Pacitic and the Southerr PaciSc while the Union Pacific by the construction of its Oregor Short Line northwest to a connection with a branch of the Oreo gon Railway and Navigation Companys system the Atchison by the construction of its line to a connection with the Southern Pa cific anl the Chicago Burlington and Quincy by the construction of its Denver extension have added three other important routes to the Pacific At least three of the great NVestern railroad sys tems are now stretching westward with the evident intention of speedily reaching the sarne ocean A striking feature of the last decade of railroad building is the large number of speculative and parallel lines which were put under way and many of them completel notably the West Shore Rail road which parallels the New York Central line for its whole length from New York to Buffalo the  NickelPlate line which parallels the Lake Shore in like Inanner from Buffalo to ChicagoF and the South Pennsylvania paralleling the Pennsylvania Railroad between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh upon which a vast sum was expended but which has not been completed In some instances such lines were yerhaps undertaken with a view to forcing their subsequent purchase by the older companies whose lines they sought to parallel and in the case of the two roads first mentioneds these plans met vvith eminent success But their fulfilment was in the maill the cause of the clepression which existed during the years I 885 I 886 and I 887 The chief feature of railroad construction of the  wave  of I88688 has been the extraordinary activity displayed by the older and more powerful corporations of the Northwest and Southwest in the extension of their lines with the apparent purpose of sex curing a tirm foothold upon every available foot of territory con tiguous to their several systems or within reach thereof The re sult of this policy has proved in many instances unwise if not disastrous as an examination of the facts herein set fort h will show The most important lines which have been constructecl during that period are here briefly summarized North and northwest of Chicago there have been completed the Duluth South Shore and Atlantic Railway forming a new short route between Duluth and RAILROADS IN THE UNITED STATES IN I889 THE year 1888 is notable for the reason that it marks the begin ning of the second century of our existence as a natlon SVhen Washington was inaugurated one hundred years ago our popula tion was less than oooooo today it is estimated at 65oooooo Enormous as hat been this increase in the population of the coun try within the short period of one hundred years the increase in wealth and material prosperity resulting from the rapid clevelop ment of the countrys wonderful resources has been in even greater ratio has in fact no

war The total mileage of our railroads at the close of I 865 was 3so85 miles In the twentythree years since then there have been constructecl I2r000 rniles of new roadan average of 5260 miles per annum twice the annual average of the whole period of sixty years and 53 times the annual average of the first periocl of thirty five years During these twentythree years the country has experienced three great waves of railroad construction which were checked only by extraordinary tinancial revulsions The first of these great construction waves occurrecl within the eight years intervening between the close of the war ancl the panic of I873 In that time the rnileage increased rnore than I00 per cent or from 35o8 5 miles in I 865 to 70268 mile in I 873 NVithin this period was completecl the Srst Pacific Etailroad line and con struction on a second line to the Pacific was well under way The cash cost of the 3ooo miles of road constructed in these eight years must have exceeded I4OOOOOOOO and the panic which began in the fall of t873 was largely the result of the transformationfol lowing so close in the wake of a great civil warof this vast sum from floating into fixed capital In New England during this period railroad mileage increased nearly 2500 miles in the Micldle States the increase was 6o70 miles about 75 per cent in the South it increased 4ooo miles 44 per cent and in the Pacific States the increase eas from I66 miles to 2I93 miles But the great increase of this periocl was in the Western and Southwestern States At the close of I873 thetotal capital investment in all the rail roacls of the Unitel States was 3784543034 epresented by share capital to the amount of I947638584 and bondecl debts to the amount of I836904450 This vast aggregate represented also the cost of 70651 miles of railroad then in operation the average cost per mile for the whole country at that time equalling 60o57 In New England the average cost was 47850 per mile in the Micldle States 67737 per rnile in the NVestern States 52I25 per mile in the Southern States 36994 per mile and in the Pacific States 895590 per mile The rnaximum cost per mile was in New Jersey

aggregate ever earned eithergrossornet by the railroads of the country In the midsummer of I888 the situation presented many hopeful aspects and it was widely be lieved that the period or depression had passed The volume of business throughout the country was larger than ever in its history and an improvement in earnings was therefore confidently looked for But unfortunately while the traffic was large and of increas ing proportions the rates received for its transportation owing to the fierce anci unbridled competition in the West drooped continu ally It appears that in the seven years I88288 the tonnage increased 228907942 tons or 63 per cent In the same period the mileage of lines in operation increased 495889I miles or 5 I per cent Computed on the basis of tonnage per mile of road the traffic of I882 vvas 36505 tons per mile cf I883 37447 tons per mile of I884 35262 tons per mile of 1885 35786 tonsper mile of I886 38534 tons per mile of I887 4030I tons per mile and of I888 40552 tons per mile It thus becomes apparent that the traffic of the past two years was the largest ever carried by the railroads of the country During I88 the volume of freight traSic was ex ceptionally large and with an increase of eight miles in the aver age length of haul per ton the earnings from this source should have been had fairly remuneratlve rates prevailed sufficient to insure a continuance of dividends by the great trunk lines rather than their suspension as has been the case in so many instances The tonnagemileage of I887 was 6I56I069996 for transport ing which the railroads received an average rate of I034 cents per ton per mile producing a rerrenue of 636666223 In I888 the tonnagemileage was 70423oo5988 which produced an average revenue per ton per mile of 907 of a cent or in the aggregate 639200723 Had the rates received in I887 prevailed in I888 the difference of about Ii mills per ton per mile would have given the railroads an increasecl revenue of 89I898I9 sufficient to pay more than 2 per cent upon the total amount of capital stock out standing at the end of I888 upon all of the roads contributing to ward this grand aggregate The causes which led to this unlookedfor result are now thor oughly understood The sentiment is unanimously expressed that the chief elements of disturbance in the railroad situation in the West have been first the unprecedented activity with which the railroad systems of that section have been extended as a result of the desire to secure entrance to the newly developed lands in the West and Southwest second the partial failure of the crops and the consequent lossof a large proportion of the traffic which had been calculated upon third the complications resulting from the application of a new and radical lawthe Interstate Commerce Act and fourth the spirit of hostility and repression evinced by the legislatures of some of the Western States To these several causes which were in themselves sufficient to demoralize the business o f even so powerful a system as that of the railroads might be added a fifth and perhaps most potent cause of all that is the very mightiness of the contestants and the magni tude of the interests involved In no period of the worlds history has there been such vast aggregations of capital engaged in com mercial enterprises as are now to be fotlnd in this country Nor is there any country in which competition in business is freer and sharper than in ours In this general competition the railroads of the country have taken active part The construction of new lines has been encouraged in every part of this country in no section more strongly than in those which are now displaying the mostSCIENCE VOL XIV No 342 I 2 6 violent antagonism toward them Nowhere were greater induce ments held out to capital to supply railroad facilities than west of the Mississippi between the close of the war and the early seven ties yet in those very States which owe their present prosperity and development to no cause more than to railroads we see the most rampant hostility displayed toward the creators of their wealth In the early days of railroads in this country their profits reached very respectable proportions In some instances where the lines were especially favored in respect to location and physical surround ings these returns were so large as to excite the cupidity of capital to such an extent that at several periods of the countrys history the eagerness displayed by railroad constructors in pushing their lines beyond the requirements of the territory resulted in plunging the country into financial crises having farreaching effects But the days of large profits appear to have passed A railroad which in the future can pay regular dividends of 5 per cent per annum will be regarded in much the same light as those which formerly paid 8 and I0 per cent for years without intermission In the Manual are three tables showing the decline in freight rates upon various railroads of the United States Table No I includes seven leading Eastern trunk lines running between Chicago and the seaboard and covers the twentyfour years I865 to I888 inclusive Upon these roads the rates received for trans ortation of freight declined from 29 cents per ton per mile in 1865 to 609 of a cent per ton per mile a reduction of 79 per ent within the period covered by the statement in other words the railroads comprised in that statement received in I888 2I for the performance of a service for which in I865 they received I00 hat other business can show a corresponding decrease in re t urns  Table No 2 gives like statistics for six leading Western trunk lines running west northwest and southwest of Chicago and embracing the same period I865 to I888 Upon these lines the eduction equalled 73 per cent in the twentyfour years or from 3642 cents per ton per mile in I865 to 934 cent in I888 The thirteen roads embraced in these two tables are typical of the entire railroad system Upon the basis of the deductions here shown it may be assumed that the average reduction throughout the whole country since the close of the civil war has been at least 70 per cent To earn an amount equal on the average to that tAarned twentyfour years ago the railroads are now required to erform a service nearly three times as great Yet notwithstand ing this the cost cf operating the lines has not been decreased to any appreciable extent Of the total cost of operating a railroad fully 80 per cent is paid to labor in one way or another Expenses of this nature cannot be materially reduced in point of fact the tendency is constantly toward an increase The average rate of wages paid by railroads is today as large as in I865 if not larger It becomes plain therefore that the immense sums that have been annually lost to the railroads of the country by their voluntary re ductions in rates have been a corresponding saving to the public at large A calculation of the sums saved to the public by these reductions in rates during the past quartercentury would reach far up into the thousands of millions During all these years the railroads have met with most active competition from the waterways of the countly upon which freight can always be transported at about onethird of the cost of railroad transportation It early became apparent to the railroad companies that to make their lines pay required an immense volume of traffic which could only be secured by the development of their routes to a point where competition from waterways need not be feared With this view tracks have been doubled trebled and even in some cases quadrupled roads have been almost entirely rebuilt with heavy steel rails locomotives and cars of double or treble their former capacity have been constructed and trains have been run with a frequency and at a rate of speed which were once con sidered to be among the impossibilities The effect of all this is seen in the wonderful development of all sections of the country but particularly in the Western States in which the progress recorded in a short quarter of a century is justly regarded as one of the rnarvels of the present age In proportion to population the earnings of the railroads in the States of Ohio Michigan Indiana Illinois Wisconsin Minnesotat Dakota Iowa Nebraska Missouri and Kansas were considerably higher in I888 than in I870 being 18 per capita in the former year as against I2 in the latter the increase being 50 per centt But this increase of averages is a very deceptive one as calculated upon the basis of mileage the only true test the earnings in T888 were but 5728 per mile as against 6753 per mile in I870 The fallingoff of revenues in these States equalled more than I000 per mile which for I888 alone amounted to an aggregate of 73000000 With these facts before u it is difficult to understand the ex traordinary antipathy to railroad corporations now prevalent in the West The railroad mileage of the West has advanced in far greater ratio than the population and the wealth and commerce of that section have kept pace with the railroad mileage Were the railroads to be advanced only in ratio to the increase in population the situation in the West and throughout the country would present an entirely different aspect and public sentiment would experience a corresponding change The acreage of wheat and corn in Ohio WIichigan Indiana Illi nois Wisconsin Minnesota D akota Iowa Nebraska Missouri and Kansas in I888 was 66435304 acres No figures of acreage in I870 are obtainable but it was undoubtedly less than 30oooooo acres in that year Without railroads the products of this im mense territory would be to a large extent valueless but such trifling matters as these are always dismissed from the considera tion of demagogues when they strive to excite the public mind upon the rapacity and greed of railroad corporations In point of importance the railroad interest now takes preced ence of all other industries or enterprises Its magnitude is greater than any other interest in the world and it has become so thor oughly a part of the economic systern of the Republic as to be second only to the government itself In order to show how closely interwoven are the interests of railroad stockholders and the workitlgclasses of the country a few calculations are herewith submitted If we estimate that in the operation of our railways there are employed in prosperous times an average of six persons per mile of road it would show a total on the basis of our present mileage of more than g36ooo persons regularly employed in connection with that single interest and if to this number we add 780ooo a number representing an average of five to the mile as the num ber of persons employed in connection with all those industries which are directly affiliated with and dependent on our railway system such as locomotive and car building establishments rail mills etc we have a total of nearly I7I6000 or an average of I I to the mile of railroad Assuming that each of these would rep resent a family averaging five persons we have an aggregate population of 8580ooo nearly oneseventh of the total for the country at large of which go per cent are actually dependent on the railway system for the sustenance of life If we allow as the average rate of wages of those employed in operating say 450 per annum and for those employed in locomotive building etc say 500 per annum we have a total payroll of 9II200000 per annum of which at least 500ooo000 is directly chargeable to operating account vvhile the remainder is for account of better ments improvements and new construction Add to this the amount paid to laborers engaged in construction in such a year as I887 In that year there were built new roads whose aggregate length was 12984 miles If we take as the average cost of labor in grading tracklaying etc for each mile of this total say I0 ooo and allow the average daily wages of laborers to be I50 with say I00 laborers of all classes to each mile this would show the average time for the completion of a mile of railroad to be 67 days On this basis the construction of I2984 miles of railroact would give steady employment for 300 days in the year to an army of 289976 laborers whose total earnings would be 129840000 This gives a total of 2oo6ooo persons to which we will add 44ooo as the number whose labors are stilnulated by the employ ment of the 289976 last mentioned making a total of 20so000t representing families numbering in the aggregate I2250000 per sons To maintain this number there would be expended by rail roads and others under the above calculations at least ISO4OJOOOSOOCAUGUST 2 3 I 889 SCIENCE I 2 7 per annum or very nearly3oooooo for each day in the year The regular expenditure of more than go per cent of this vast sum stimulates other industries and in this manner the volume of gen eral business is increased in progressive ratio In these calculations no account has been taken of the large 1lumber of people forming the proprietary interest of this vast ag gregation of capital which comprises people in all classes and in all occupations and scattered throughout all parts of the country The New York Central Railroad Company has I0000 stock holders whose average holding is about gooo If we take that sum as representing the average holding of all stock and bond holders in the country the total number of such would be over I000000 representing more than 5000000 persons witll important interests in the success of the railroad system From these deductions a general idea can be gathered of the magnitude of the railroad interest and how vast and widespread is the interest of our people in that system From the tables in the Manual it appears that during the past ten years the following percentages of profit have been distributed to holders of the share capital of our railroads In 1879 the divi tdends paid averaged 25 per cent of the total amount of capital stock outstanding in I880 28 per cent was paid in I88I 29 per cent in I882 29I per cent in I883 275 per cent in I884 248 per cent in I885 202 per cent in I886 204 per cent in I887 2 I8 per cent and in I888 I 77 per cent BUtIACH iN an article on the California insecticide known as buhach which was mentioned in Sczence of May 24 the JovrnaS of Ghve So rzeGy of Arts London says this product is a fine powder made from the flowers of the PyreZhrvxn cznerarzfoAzvzn largely used for the destruction of insects This plant was originally a native of Persia from whence it was introduced to Dalmatia and adjoining States of Herzegovina and Montenegro where it has been almost exclusively cultivated until a few years ago The importance of this industry was considered so great in these countries that spe cial efforts were made to prevent the export of seeds and plants by the governments The plant was first introduced into California about twelve years ago by a Mr Mileo a native of Dalmatia who succeeded after some trouble in obtaining seed from his country After experimenting for some time in order to find a suitable soil and climate this gentleman finally succeeded in growing the plant on an extensive scale and in I880 associating himself with other eapitalists established the Buhach Producing and Manufacturing CCompany At the present time the company have about 300 acres Kof this plant under cultivatiorl at their farm near Atwater Cal and own mills for grinding the dried flowers to powder at Stockton The cultivation of pyrethrum requires careful and intelligent su fpervision and it cannot be grown successfully without irrigation It requires three years from the time of sowingto grow plants ca pable of producing a paying crop of flowers and then they will bear from four to five years longer It is at its prime howelrer in its fourth or fifth year The plant grows about thirty inches high and is set out in rows four feet apart and from fifteen to twenty four inches apart in the rows The flowers are harvested towards the latter part of May The stalks are cut just above the roots and the flowers stripped from them by passing the plants through a kind of comb The detached flowers fall into a box below and are carried to the drying ground where they are spread on sheets and exposed to the rays of the sun during the day being repeatedly turned over in the meantime They are covered during the night to prevent their absorbing moisture as the perfect drying of the flowers is most important in order to retain the volatile oil which gives the powder its insecticide properties It is also very necessary that this operation should be done quickly and that the flowers during the drying process should be protected from moisture A slight dew fall ing upon the flowers at this time will injure their color and reduce  their strength as an insect destroyer In this respect the Califor niagrown flowers are better cured and consequently more valua ble than those produced in Dalmatia it being acknowledged by experts that the particular conditions of soil and climate in Califoir mia are extremely favorable to the growth and curing of plants rich in the essential oil which renders them so destructive to insect life Like many other products insect powders are liable to adultera tion and last year a large quantity made from the flowers of the Hungarian daisy mixed with a small proportion of pyrethrum was placed upon the market by unscrupulous dealers Inferior pow ders are also manufactured from the stems and leaves of the plant which possess to a certain extent the properties of buhach SAWING STONE BY HELICOIDAL WIRE CORD A NEW plan of cutting stone by means of wire cord has been adopted in many European quarries While retaining sand as the cutting agent M Panlin Gay of Marseilles has succeeded in ap plying it by mechanical means and as continuously as the sand blast and l bandsaw with both of which appliances his system  that of the  helicoidal wire cord has considerable analogy An engine puts in motion a continuous wire cord varying from five to seven thirtyseconds of an inch in diameter according to the work composed of three rnild steel wires twisted at a certain pitch that found to give the best results in practice at a speed of from fifteen to seventeen feet per second the higher speed being adopted for the smaller diameter Instead of the stone being brought to the saw the wire cord which may be of indefinite length is led to the stone being guided by grooved pulleys mounted on bearings with universal joint which permits of their adapting themselves to any change of diXec tion The same cord which is kept at uniform tension by a weighted truck on an inclined plane may act upon any number of blocks provided sufficient space be given between them to alIow for cooling The pulleys are mounted in standards and are fed down by end less screws rotated automatically if the stone be uniform but preferably by hand if there is reason to suspect irregularities in its texture Sand and water is allowed to flow freely into the cuts the sand carried along by the cord in the spiral interstices between the wires causing a uniform attrition of the stone The twist of the cord causes it while travelling to turn upon itself and thus be come worn evenly A cord of I 50 yards in length will cut about seventy feet deep in blocks fifteen feet long or produce four hun dred and ninety square feet of sawn surface before being worn out The sand must be sharp and not used more than three times The natureof the sand is determined by the hardness of the stone thus quartz sand will cut granite and porphyry which it has hith erto been found impossible to saw or indeed cut in any other way than by pick or chisel An hourly advance of one inch in gran ite or porphyry and four inches in marble is regularly obtained in blocks of fifteen or sixteen feet long At the Brussels Exhibition of last year where the system was awarded a prize the same cord which cut marble also cut a block of coIlcrete composed of quartz pebbles Not merely does the helicoidal cordt saw blocks of stone but it elren cuts them out of the solid rock in the quarry To do this it is necessary to sink shafts of two or two and a half feet in diame ter in order to introduce the pulleycarriers If there is a free side to start from one shaft is sufficient for a triangular block but for a quadrangular one which is preferable two shafts are necessary They are bored by a rtlechanical perforator consisting of a hollow plateiron cylinder having at its lower end a slightly thicker collar which acts with sand and water in its latest development The cylinder is made to revolve at a speed of one hundred and forty revolutions a minute by means of a teledynamic cable advancing about an inch per hour in marble An annular space is cut in the rock leaving a core which may be utilized as a column The di ameter of the shaftway depends upon the diameter of columns most in demand provided a sufficient number be sunk and the in tervening angles broken down so as to afford sufficient room for the pulley carrier In the case of stratified rocks the shaftcuts are carried down to a natural parting but in unstratified rocks a nearly horizontal cut may be made with the cord sufficient inclination being given to insure the flow of sand and water to the bottom of the cut Such is the method of working practised at the Traigneaux

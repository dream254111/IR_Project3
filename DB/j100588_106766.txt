J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106766,EXPERIMENTS ON AIR BY HENRY CAVENDISH ESQ FRS AND AS,I206942,372 XXIII EXPERIMENTS ON AIR BY HENRY CAVENDISH ESQ FRS AND AS READ JUNE 2 1785 IN A PAPER PRINTED IN THE LAST VOLUME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH I GAVE MY REASONS FOR THINKING THAT THE DIMINUTION PRODUCED IN ATMOSPHERIC AIR BY PHLOGISTICATION IS NOT OWING TO THE GENERATION OF FIXED AIR I SAID IT SEEMED MOST LIKELY THAT THE PHLOGISTICATION OF AIR BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK WAS OWING TO THE BURNING OF SOME INFLAMMABLE MATTER IN THE APPA RATUS AND THAT THE FIXED AIR SUPPOSED TO BE PRODUCED IN THAT PROCESS WAS ONLY SEPARATED FROM THAT INFLAMMABLE MATTER BY THE BURNING AT THAT TIME HAVING MADE NO EXPERIMENTS ON THE SUBJECT MYSELF I WAS OBLIGED TO FORM MY OPINION FROM THOSE ALREADY PUBLISHED BUT I NOW FIND THAT THOUGH I WAS RIGHT IN SUPPOSING THE PHLOGISTICATION OF THE AIR DOES NOT PRO CEED FROM PHLOGISTON COMMUNICATED TO IT BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK AND THAT NO PART OF THE AIR IS CONVERTED INTO FIXED AIR YET THAT THE REAL CAUSE OF THE DIMINUTION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I SUSPECTED AND DEPENDS UPON THE CONVERSION OF PHLOGISTICATED AIR INTO NITROUS ACID THE APPARATUS USED IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENTS WAS AS FOLLOWS THE AIR THROUGH WHICH THE SPARK WAS INTENDED TO BE PASSED WAS CONFINED IN A GLASS TUBE M BENT TO AN ANGLE AS IN FIG 1 TAB XV WHICH AFTER BEING FILLED WITH QUICKSILVER WAS INVERTED INTO TWO GLASSES OF THE SAME FLUID AS IN THE FIGURE THE AIR TO BEMR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR 373 BE TRIED WAS THEN INTRODUCED BY MEANS OF A SMALL TUBE SUCH AS IS USED FOR THERMOMETERS BENT IN THE MANNER REPRESENTED BY ABC FIG 2 THE BENT END OF WHICH AFTER BEING PREVIOUSLY FILLED WITH QUICKSILVER WAS INTRODUCED AS IN THE FIGURE UNDER THE GLASS DEF INVERTED INTO WATER AND FILLED WITH THE PROPER KIND OF AIR THE END C OF THE TUBE BEING KEPT STOPPED BY THE FINGER THEN ON REMOVING THE FINGER FROM C THE QUICKSILVER IN THE TUBE DESCENDED IN THE LEG BC AND ITS PLACE WAS SUPPLIED WITH AIR FROM THE GLASS DEF HAVING THUS GOT THE PROPER QUANTITY OF AIR INTO THE TUBE ABC IT WAS HELD WITH THE END C UPPERMOST AND STOPPED WITH THE FINGER AND THE END A MADE SMALLER FOR THAT PURPOSE BEING INTRODUCED INTO ONE END OF THE BENT TUBE M FIG 1 THE AIR ON REMOVING THE FINGER FROM C WAS FORCED INTO THAT TUBE BY THE PRESSURE OF THE QUICKSILVER IN THE LEG BC BY THESE MEANS I WAS ENABLED TO INTRODUCE THE EXACT QUANTITY I PLEASED OF ANY KIND OF AIR INTO THE TUBE M AND BY THE SAME MEANS I COULD LET UP ANY QUANTITY OF SOAP LEESOR ANY OTHER LIQUOR WHICH I WANTED TO BE IN CONTACT WITH THE AIR IN ONE CASE HOWEVER IN WHICH I WANTED TO INTRODUCE AIR INTO THE TUBE MANY TIMES IN THE SAME EXPERIMENT I USED THE APPARATUS REPRESENTED IN FIG 3 CONSISTING OF A TUBE AB OF A SMALL BORE A BALL C AND A TUBE DE OF A LARGER BORE THIS APPARATUS WAS FIRST FILLED WITH QUICKSILVER AND THEN THE BALL C AND THE TUBE AB WERE FILLED WITH AIR BY INTRODUCING THE END A UNDER A GLASS INVERTED INTO WATER WHICH CONTAINED THE PROPER KIND OF AIR AND DRAWING OUT THE QUICKSILVER FROM THE LEG ED BY A SYPHON AFTER BEING THUS FURNISHED WITH AIR THE APPARATUS WAS WEIGHED AND THE END A INTRODUCED INTO ONE END OF THE TUBE M AND KEPT THERE DURING THE EXPERIMENT THE WAY OF FORCING AIR OUT OF THIS APPARATUS INTO THE TUBE BEING BY THRUSTING374 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR THRUSTING DOWN THE TUBE ED A WOODEN CYLINDER OF SUCH A SIZE AS ALMOST TO FILL UP THE WHOLE BORE AND BY OCCASIONALLY POURING QUICKSILVER INTO THE SAME TUBE TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THAT PUSHED INTO THE BALL C AFTER THE EXPERIMENT WAS FINISHED THE APPARATUS WAS WEIGHED AGAIN WHICH SHEWED EXACTLY HOW MUCH AIR HAD BEEN FORCED INTO THE TUBE M DURING THE WHOLE EXPERI MENT IT BEING EQUAL IN BULK TO A QUANTITY OF QUICKSILVER WHOSE WEIGHT WAS EQUAL TO THE INCREASE OF WEIGHT OF THE APPARATUS THE BORE OF THE TUBE M USED IN MOST OF THE FOLLOWING EX PERIMENTS WAS ABOUT ONETENTH OF AN INCH AND THE LENGTH OF THE COLUMN OF AIR OCCUPYING THE UPPER PART OF THE TUBE WAS IN GENERAL FROM 112 TO 34 OF AN INCH IT IS SCARCELY NECESSARY TO INFORM ANY ONE USED TO ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS THAT IN ORDER TO FORCE AN ELECTRICAL SPARK THROUGH THE TUBE IT WAS NECESSARY NOT TO MAKE A COMMUNICATION BE TWEEN THE TUBE AND THE CONDUCTOR BUT TO PLACE AN INSULATED BALL AT SUCH A DISTANCE FROM THE CONDUCTOR AS TO RECEIVE A SPARK FROM IT AND TO MAKE A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THAT BALL AND THE QUICKSILVER IN ONE OF THE GLASSES WHILE THE QUICKSILVER IN THE OTHER GLASS COMMUNICATED WITH THE GROUND I NOW PROCEED TO THE EXPERIMENTS WHEN THE ELECTRIC SPARK WAS MADE TO PASS THROUGH COMMON AIR INCLUDED BETWEEN SHORT COLUMNS OF A SOLUTION OF LITMUS THE SOLUTION ACQUIRED A RED COLOUR AND THE AIR WAS DIMINISHED CONFORMABLY TO WHAT WAS OBSERVED BY DR PRIESTLEY WHEN LIMEWATER WAS USED INSTEAD OF THE SOLUTION OF LITMUS AND THE SPARK WAS CONTINUED TILL THE AIR COULD BE NO FURTHER DI MINISHED NOT THE LEAST CLOUD COULD BE PERCEIVED IN THE LIME WATER BUT THE AIR WAS REDUCED TO TWOTHIRDS OF ITS ORIGINAL BULK WHICH IS A GREATER DIMINUTION THAN IT COULD HAVE SUFFERED BY MERE PHLOGISTICATION AS THAT IS VERY LITTLE MORE THAN ONE FIFTH OF THE WHOLE THEMR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR 375 THE EXPERIMENT WAS NEXT REPEATED WITH SOME IMPURE DE PHLOGISTICATED AIR THE AIR WAS VERY MUCH DIMINISHED BUT WITHOUT THE LEAST CLOUD BEING PRODUCED IN THE LIMEWATER NEI THER WAS ANY CLOUD PRODUCED WHEN FIXED AIR WAS LET UP TO IT BUT ON THE FURTHER ADDITION OF A LITTLE CAUSTIC VOLATILE ALKALI A BROWN SEDIMENT WAS IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED HENCE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT THE LIMEWATER WAS SATURATED BY SOME ACID FORMED DURING THE OPERATION AS IN THIS CASE IT IS EVIDENT THAT NO EARTH COULD BE PRECIPITATED BY THE FIXED AIR ALONE BUT THAT CAUSTIC VOLATILE ALKALI ON BEING ADDED WOULD ABSORB THE FIXED AIR AND THUS BECOMING MILD WOULD IMME DIATELY PRECIPITATE THE EARTH WHEREAS IF THE EARTH IN THE LIME WATER HAD NOT BEEN SATURATED WITH AN ACID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRECIPITATED BY THE FIXED AIR AS TO THE BROWN COLOUR OF THE SEDIMENT IT MOST LIKELY PROCEEDED FROM SOME OF THE QUICKSILVER HAVING BEEN DISSOLVED IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT IF ANY FIXED AIR AS WELL AS ACID HAD BEEN GENERATED IN THESE TWO EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LIMEWATER A CLOUD MUST HAVE BEEN AT FIRST PERCEIVED IN IT THOUGH THAT CLOUD WOULD AFTERWARDS DISAPPEAR BY THE EARTH BEING REDISSOLVED BY THE ACID FOR TILL THE ACID PRODUCED WAS SUFFICIENT TO DISSOLVE THE WHOLE OF THE EARTH SOME OF THE REMAINDER WOULD BE PRE CIPITATED BY THE FIXED AIR SO THAT WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT NO FIXED AIR WAS GENERATED IN THE OPERATION WHEN THE AIR IS CONFINED BY SOAPLEES THE DIMINUTION PRO CEEDS RATHER FASTER THAN WHEN IT IS CONFINED BY LIMEWATER FOR WHICH REASON AS WELL AS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CONTAINING SO MUCH MORE ALKALINE MATTER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR BULK SOAP LEES SEEMED BETTER ADAPTED FOR EXPERIMENTS DESIGNED TO INVESTI GATE THE NATURE OF THIS ACID THAN LIMEWATER I ACCORDINGLY MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE WHAT DEGREE OF PURITY THE VOL LXXV D D D AIR376 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR AIR SHOULD BE OF IN ORDER TO BE DIMINISHED MOST READILY AND TO THE GREATEST DEGREE AND I FOUND THAT WHEN GOOD DEPHLOGISTI CATED AIR WAS USED THE DIMINUTION WAS BUT SMALL WHEN PER FECTLY PHLOGISTICATED AIR WAS USED NO SENSIBLE DIMINUTION TOOK PLACE BUT WHEN FIVE PARTS OF PURE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR WERE MIXED WITH THREE PARTS OF COMMON AIR ALMOST THE WHOLE OF THE AIR WAS MADE TO DISAPPEAR IT MUST BE CONSIDERED THAT COMMON AIR CONSISTS OF ONE PART OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR MIXED WITH FOUR OF PHLOGISTICATED SO THAT A MIXTURE OF FIVE PARTS OF PURE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR AND THREE OF COMMON AIR IS THE SAME THING AS A MIXTURE OF SEVEN PARTS OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR WITH THREE OF PHLOGISTICATED HAVING MADE THESE PREVIOUS TRIALS I INTRODUCED INTO THE TUBE A LITTLE SOAPLEES AND THEN LET UP SOME DEPHLOGISTICATED AND COMMON AIR MIXED IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED PROPORTIONS WHICH RISING TO THE TOP OF THE TUBE M DIVIDED THE SOAPLEES INTO ITS TWO LEGS AS FAST AS THE AIR WAS DIMINISHED BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK I CONTINUED ADDING MORE OF THE SAME KIND TILL NO FUR THER DIMINUTION TOOK PLACE AFTER WHICH A LITTLE PURE DEPHLO GISTICATED AIR AND AFTER THAT A LITTLE COMMON AIR WERE ADDED IN ORDER TO SEE WHETHER THE CESSATION OF DIMINUTION WAS NOT OWING TO SOME IMPERFECTION IN THE PROPORTION OF THE TWO KINDS OF AIR TO EACH OTHER BUT WITHOUT EFFECT  THE SOAPLEES BEING THEN POURED OUT OF THE TUBE AND SEPARATED FROM THE QUICK  FROM WHAT FOLLOWS IT APPEARS THAT THE REASON WHY THE AIR CEASED TO DIMINISH WAS THAT AS THE SOAPLEES WERE THEN BECOME NEUTRALIZED NO ALKALI REMAINED TO AB SORB THE ACID FORMED BY THE OPERATION AND IN CONSEQUENCE SCARCE ANY AIR WAS TURNED INTO ACID THE SPARK HOWEVER WAS NOT CONTINUED LONG ENOUGH AFTER THE APPA RENT CESSATION OF DIMINUTION TO DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER IT WAS ONLY THAT THE DIMINUTION WENT ON REMARKABLY SLOWER THAN BEFORE OR THAT IT WAS ALMOST COME TO A STAND AND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CARRIED MUCH FURTHER THOUGH I HAD PERSISTED IN PASSING THE SPARKS SILVERMR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR 377 SILVER SEEMED TO BE PERFECTLY NEUTRALIZED AS THEY DID NOT AT ALL DISCOLOUR PAPER TINGED WITH THE JUICE OF BLUE FLOWERS BEING EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS THEY LEFT A SMALL QUANTITY OF SALT WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY NITRE AS APPEARED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH PAPER IMPREGNATED WITH A SOLUTION OF IT BURNED FOR MORE SATISFACTION I TRIED THIS EXPERIMENT OVER AGAIN ON A LARGER SCALE ABOUT FIVE TIMES THE FORMER QUANTITY OF SOAPLEES WERE NOW LET UP INTO A TUBE OF A LARGER BORE AND A MIXTURE OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AND COMMON AIR IN THE SAME PROPORTIONS AS BEFORE BEING INTRODUCED BY THE APPARATUS REPRESENTED IN FIG 3 THE SPARK WAS CONTINUED TILL NO MORE AIR COULD BE MADE TO DISAP PEAR THE LIQUOR WHEN POURED OUT OF THE TUBE SMELLED EVIDENTLY OF PHLOGISTICATED NITROUS ACID AND BEING EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS YIELDED 1 410 GR OF SALT WHICH IS PRETTY EXACTLY EQUAL IN WEIGHT TO THE NITRE WHICH THAT QUANTITY OF SOAPLEES WOULD HAVE AFFORDED IF SATURATED WITH NITROUS ACID THIS SALT WAS FOUND BY THE MAN NER IN WHICH PAPER DIPPED INTO A SOLUTION OF IT BURNED TO BE TRUE NITRE IT APPEARED BY THE TEST OF TERRA PONDEROSA SALITA TO CONTAIN NOT MORE VITRIOLIC ACID THAN THE SOAPLEES THEMSELVES CONTAINED WHICH WAS EXCESSIVELY LITTLE AND THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT ANY OTHER ACID ENTERED INTO IT EXCEPT THE NITROUS A CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER OCCURRED WHICH AT FIRST SEEMED TO SHEW THAT THIS SALT CONTAINED SOME MARINE ACID NAMELY AN EVIDENT PRECIPITATION TOOK PLACE WHEN A SOLUTION OF SILVER WAS ADDED TO SOME OF IT DISSOLVED IN WATER THOUGH THE SOAP LEES USED IN ITS FORMATION WERE PERFECTLY FREE FROM MARINE ACID AND THOUGH TO PREVENT ALL DANGER OF ANY PRECIPITATE BEING FORMED BY AN EXCESS OF ALKALI IN IT SOME PURIFIED NITROUS ACID HAD BEEN ADDED TO IT PREVIOUS TO THE ADDITION OF THE SOLUTION OF SILVER ON CONSIDERATION HOWEVER I SUSPECTED THAT THIS PRECIPITATION MIGHT ARISE FROM THE NITROUS ACID IN IT BEING PHLO D D D 2 GISTICATED378 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR GISTICATED AND THEREFORE I TRIED WHETHER NITRE MUCH PHLOGISTI CATED WOULD PRECIPITATE SILVER FROM ITS SOLUTION FOR THIS PUR POSE I EXPOSED SOME NITRE TO THE FIRE IN AN EARTHEN RETORT TILL IT HAD YIELDED A GOOD DEAL OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR AND THEN HAV ING DISSOLVED IT IN WATER AND ADDED TO IT SOME WELL PURIFIED SPIRIT OF NITRE TILL IT WAS SENSIBLY ACID IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE ALKALI DID NOT PREDOMINATE I DROPPED INTO IT SOME SOLUTION OF SILVER WHICH IMMEDIATELY MADE A VERY COPIOUS PRE CIPITATE THIS SOLUTION HOWEVER BEING DEPRIVED OF SOME OF ITS PHLOGISTON BY EVAPORATION TO DRYNESS AND EXPOSURE FOR A FEW WEEKS TO THE AIR LOST THE PROPERTY OF PRECIPITATING SILVER FROM ITS SOLUTION A PROOF THAT THIS PROPERTY DEPENDED ONLY ON ITS PHLOGISTICATION AND NOT ON ITS HAVING ABSORBED SEASALT FROM THE RETORT OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS HENCE IT IS CERTAIN THAT NITRE WHEN MUCH PHLOGISTICATED IS CAPABLE OF MAKING A PRECIPITATE WITH A SOLUTION OF SILVER AND THEREFORE THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT THE PRECIPITATE WHICH OUR SALT OCCASIONED WITH A SOLUTION OF SILVER PROCEEDED FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN THAT OF ITS BEING PHLOGISTICATED ESPECIALLY AS IT APPEARED BY THE SMELL BOTH ON FIRST TAKING IT OUT OF THE TUBE AND ON THE ADDITION OF THE SPIRIT OF NITRE PREVIOUS TO DROPPING IN THE SOLUTION OF SILVER THAT THE ACID IN IT WAS MUCH PHLOGISTICATED THIS PROPERTY OF PHLOGISTICATED NITRE IS WORTH THE ATTENTION OF CHEMISTS AS OTHERWISE THEY MAY SOMETIMES BE LED INTO MISTAKES IN INVESTIGATING THE PRESENCE OF MARINE ACID BY A SOLUTION OF SILVER IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED PAPER I SAID THAT WHEN NITRE IS DETO NATED WITH CHARCOAL THE ACID IS CONVERTED INTO PHLOGISTICATED AIR THAT IS INTO A SUBSTANCE WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD PERCEIVE POSSESSES ALL THE PROPERTIES OF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR OF OUR AT MOSPHERE FROM WHICH I CONCLUDED THAT PHLOGISTICATED AIR IS 5 NOTHINGMR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR 379 NOTHING ELSE THAN NITROUS ACID UNITED TO PHLOGISTON ACCORDING TO THIS CONCLUSION PHLOGISTICATED AIR OUGHT TO BE REDUCED TO NITROUS ACID BY BEING DEPRIVED OF ITS PHLOGISTON BUT AS DE PHLOGISTICATED AIR IS ONLY WATER DEPRIVED OF PHLOGISTON IT IS PLAIN THAT ADDING DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR TO A BODY IS EQUIVALENT TO DEPRIVING IT OF PHLOGISTON AND ADDING WATER TO IT AND THEREFORE PHLOGISTICATED AIR OUGHT ALSO TO BE REDUCED TO NITROUS ACID BY BEING MADE TO UNITE TO OR FORM A CHEMICAL COMBINA TION WITH DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR ONLY THE ACID FORMED THIS WAY WILL BE MORE DILUTE THAN IF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR WAS SIMPLY DEPRIVED OF PHLOGISTON THIS BEING PREMISED WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT IN THE PRESENT EXPERIMENTS THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR WAS ENABLED BY MEANS OF THE ELECTRICAL SPARK TO UNITE TO OR FORM A CHEMICAL COMBINATION WITH THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR AND WAS THEREBY REDUCED TO NITROUS ACID WHICH UNITED TO THE SOAPLEES AND FORMED A SOLUTION OF NITRE FOR IN THESE EXPERIMENTS THOSE TWO AIRS ACTUALLY DISAPPEARED AND NITROUS ACID WAS ACTUALLY FORMED IN THEIR ROOM AND AS MOREOVER IT HAS JUST BEEN SHEWN FROM OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PHLOGISTICATED AIR MUST FORM NITROUS ACID WHEN COMBINED WITH DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR THE ABOVEMENTIONED OPINION SEEMS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY ESTABLISHED A FURTHER CONFIRMA TION OF IT IS THAT AS FAR AS I CAN PERCEIVE NO DIMINUTION OF AIR IS PRODUCED WHEN THE ELECTRIC SPARK IS PASSED EITHER THROUGH PURE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR OR THROUGH PERFECTLY PHLOGISTICATED AIR WHICH INDICATES THE NECESSITY OF A COMBINATION OF THESE TWO AIRS TO PRODUCE THE ACID MOREOVER IT WAS FOUND IN THE LAST EXPERIMENT THAT THE QUANTITY OF NITRE PROCURED WAS THE SAME THAT THE SOAPLEES WOULD HAVE PRODUCED IF SATURATED WITH NI TROUS ACID WHICH SHEWS THAT THE PRODUCTION OF THE NITRE WAS NOT OWING TO ANY DECOMPOSITION OF THE SOAPLEES IT380 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR IT MAY BE WORTH REMARKING THAT WHEREAS IN THE DETONATION OF NITRE WITH INFLAMMABLE SUBSTANCES THE ACID UNITES TO PHLO GISTON AND FORMS PHLOGISTICATED AIR IN THESE EXPERIMENTS THE REVERSE OF THIS PROCESS WAS CARRIED ON NAMELY THE PHLOGISTI CATED AIR UNITED TO THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO BEING DEPRIVED OF ITS PHLOGISTON AND WAS REDUCED TO NITROUS ACID IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED PAPER I ALSO GAVE MY REASONS FOR THINKING THAT THE SMALL QUANTITY OF NITROUS ACID PRODUCED BY THE EXPLOSION OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AND INFLAMMABLE AIR PRO CEEDED FROM A PORTION OF PHLOGISTICATED AIR MIXED WITH THE DE PHLOGISTICATED WHICH I SUPPOSED WAS DEPRIVED OF ITS PHLOGISTON AND TURNED INTO NITROUS ACID BY THE ACTION OF THE DEPHLOGISTI CATED AIR ON IT ASSISTED BY THE HEAT OF THE EXPLOSION THIS OPINION AS MUST APPEAR TO EVERY ONE IS CONFIRMED IN A RE MARKABLE MANNER BY THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS AS FROM THEM IT IS EVIDENT THAT DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR IS ABLE TO DEPRIVE PHLO GISTICATED AIR OF ITS PHLOGISTON AND REDUCE IT INTO ACID WHEN ASSISTED BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK AND THEREFORE IT IS NOT EXTRAORDI NARY THAT IT SHOULD DO SO WHEN ASSISTED BY THE HEAT OF THE EXPLOSION THE SOAPLEES USED IN THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE FROM SALT OF TARTAR PREPARED WITHOUT NITRE AND WERE OF SUCH A STRENGTH AS TO YIELD ONETENTH OF THEIR WEIGHT OF NITRE WHEN SATURATED WITH NITROUS ACID THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR ALSO WAS PREPARED WITHOUT NITRE THAT USED IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT WITH THE SOAPLEES BEING PROCURED FROM THE BLACK POWDER FORMED BY THE AGITATION OF QUICKSILVER MIXED WITH LEAD  AND THAT USED  THIS AIR WAS AS PURE AS ANY THAT CAN BE PROCURED BY MOST PROCESSES I PRO POSE GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THE EXPERIMENT IN WHICH IT WAS PREPARED IN A FUTURE PAPER INMR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR 381 IN THE LATTER FROM TURBITH MINERAL IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT THE QUANTITY OF SOAPLEES USED WAS 35 MEASURES EACH OF WHICH WAS EQUAL IN BULK TO ONE GRAIN OF QUICKSILVER AND THAT OF THE AIR ABSORBED WAS 416 SUCH MEASURES OF PHLOGISTICATED AIR AND 914 OF DEPHLOGISTICATED IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT 178 MEASURES OF SOAPLEES WERE USED AND THEY ABSORBED 1920 OF PHLOGISTI CATED AIR AND 4860 OF DEPHLOGISTICATED IT MUST BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT IN BOTH EXPERIMENTS SOME AIR REMAINED IN THE TUBE UNCONDENSED WHOSE DEGREE OF PURITY I HAD NO WAY OF TRYING SO THAT THE PROPORTION OF EACH SPECIES OF AIR ABSORBED IS NOT KNOWN WITH MUCH EXACTNESS AS FAR AS THE EXPERIMENTS HITHERTO PUBLISHED EXTEND WE SCARCELY KNOW MORE OF THE NATURE OF THE PHLOGISTICATED PART OF OUR ATMOSPHERE THAN THAT IT IS NOT DIMINISHED BY LIMEWATER CAUSTIC ALKALIES OR NITROUS AIR THAT IT IS UNFIT TO SUPPORT FIRE OR MAINTAIN LIFE IN ANIMALS AND THAT ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS NOT MUCH LESS THAN THAT OF COMMON AIR SO THAT THOUGH THE NITROUS ACID BY BEING UNITED TO PHLOGISTON IS CONVERTED INTO AIR POSSESSED OF THESE PROPERTIES AND CONSEQUENTLY THOUGH IT WAS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT PART AT LEAST OF THE PHLOGISTI CATED AIR OF THE ATMOSPHERE CONSISTS OF THIS ACID UNITED TO PHLO GISTON YET IT MIGHT FAIRLY BE DOUBTED WHETHER THE WHOLE IS OF THIS KIND OR WHETHER THERE ARE NOT IN REALITY MANY DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES CONFOUNDED TOGETHER BY US UNDER THE NAME OF PHLO GISTICATED AIR I THEREFORE MADE AN EXPERIMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE WHOLE OF A GIVEN PORTION OF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR OF THE ATMOSPHERE COULD BE REDUCED TO NITROUS ACID OR WHETHER THERE WAS NOT A PART OF A DIFFERENT NATURE FROM THE REST WHICH WOULD REFUSE TO UNDERGO THAT CHANGE THE FOREGOING EXPERI MENTS INDEED IN SOME MEASURE DECIDED THIS POINT AS MUCH THE GREATEST PART OF THE AIR LET UP INTO THE TUBE LOST ITS ELASTICITY YET382 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR YET AS SOME REMAINED UNABSORBED IT DID NOT APPEAR FOR CERTAIN WHETHER THAT WAS OF THE SAME NATURE AS THE REST OR NOT FOR THIS PURPOSE I DIMINISHED A SIMILAR MIXTURE OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AND COMMON AIR IN THE SAME MANNER AS BEFORE TILL IT WAS REDUCED TO A SMALL PART OF ITS ORIGINAL BULK I THEN IN ORDER TO DECOMPOUND AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR WHICH REMAINED IN THE TUBE ADDED SOME DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR TO IT AND CONTINUED THE SPARK TILL NO FURTHER DIMINUTION TOOK PLACE HAVING BY THESE MEANS CONDENSED AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR I LET UP SOME SOLUTION OF LIVER OF SULPHUR TO ABSORB THE DEPHLO GISTICATED AIR AFTER WHICH ONLY A SMALL BUBBLE OF AIR REMAINED UNABSORBED WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT MORE THAN 1120 OF THE BULK OF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR LET UP INTO THE TUBE SO THAT IF THERE IS ANY PART OF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR OF OUR ATMOSPHERE WHICH DIFFERS FROM THE REST AND CANNOT BE REDUCED TO NITROUS ACID WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT IT IS NOT MORE THAN 1120 PART OF THE WHOLE THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS SHEW THAT THE CHIEF CAUSE OF THE DIMINUTION WHICH COMMON AIR OR A MIXTURE OF COMMON AND DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR SUFFERS BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK IS THE CONVERSION OF THE AIR INTO NITROUS ACID BUT YET IT SEEMED NOT UNLIKELY THAT WHEN ANY LIQUOR CONTAINING INFLAMMABLE MAT TER WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE AIR IN THE TUBE SOME OF THIS MATTER MIGHT BE BURNT BY THE SPARK AND THEREBY DIMINISH THE AIR AS I SUPPOSED IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED PAPER TO BE THE CASE THE BEST WAY WHICH OCCURRED TO ME OF DISCOVERING WHETHER THIS HAPPENED OR NOT WAS TO PASS THE SPARK THROUGH DEPHLOGISTI CATED AIR INCLUDED BETWEEN DIFFERENT LIQUORS FOR THEN IF THE DIMINUTION PROCEEDED SOLELY FROM THE CONVERSION OF AIR INTO NITROUS ACID IT IS PLAIN THAT WHEN THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR WAS PERFECTLY PURE NO DIMINUTION WOULD TAKE PLACE BUT WHEN IT CONTAINEDMR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR 383 CONTAINED ANY PHLOGISTICATED AIR ALL THIS PHLOGISTICATED AIR JOINED TO AS MUCH OF THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR AS MUST UNITE TO IT IN ORDER TO REDUCE IT INTO ACID THAT IS TWO OR THREE TIMES ITS BULK WOULD DISAPPEAR AND NO MORE SO THAT THE WHOLE DIMI NUTION COULD NOT EXCEED THREE OR FOUR TIMES THE BULK OF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR WHEREAS IF THE DIMINUTION PROCEEDED FROM THE BURNING OF THE INFLAMMABLE MATTER THE PURER THE DEPHLO GISTICATED AIR WAS THE GREATER AND QUICKER WOULD BE THE DIMI NUTION THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENTS WAS THAT WHEN DEPHLO GISTICATED AIR CONTAINING ONLY 120 OF ITS BULK OF PHLO GISTICATED AIR THAT BEING THE PUREST AIR I THEN HAD WAS CON FINED BETWEEN SHORT COLUMNS OF SOAP LEES AND THE SPARK PASSED THROUGH IT TILL NO FURTHER DIMINUTION COULD BE PERCEIVED THE AIR LOST 4 32 0 0 OF ITS BULK WHICH IS NOT A GREATER DIMINUTION THAN MIGHT VERY LIKELY PROCEED FROM THE FIRSTMENTIONED CAUSE AS THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR MIGHT EASILY BE MIXED WITH A LITTLE COMMON AIR WHILE INTRODUCING INTO THE TUBE WHEN THE SAME DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR WAS CONFINED BETWEEN COLUMNS OF DISTILLED WATER THE DIMINUTION WAS RATHER GREATER THAN BEFORE AND A WHITE POWDER WAS FORMED ON THE SURFACE OF THE QUICKSILVER BENEATH THE REASON OF WHICH IN ALL PROBABI LITY WAS THAT THE ACID PRODUCED IN THE OPERATION CORRODED THE QUICKSILVER AND FORMED THE WHITE POWDER AND THAT THE NITROUS AIR PRODUCED BY THAT CORROSION UNITED TO THE DEPHLO GISTICATED AIR AND CAUSED A GREATER DIMINUTION THAN WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHEN A SOLUTION OF LITMUS WAS USED INSTEAD OF DISTILLED WATER THE SOLUTION SOON ACQUIRED A RED COLOUR WHICH GREW PALER AND PALER AS THE SPARK WAS CONTINUED TILL AT LAST IT BE CAME QUITE COLOURLESS AND TRANSPARENT THE AIR WAS DIMINISHED VOL LXXV E E E BY384 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON AIR BY ALMOST HALF AND I BELIEVE MIGHT HAVE BEEN STILL FURTHER DI MINISHED HAD THE SPARK BEEN CONTINUED WHEN LIMEWATER WAS LET UP INTO THE TUBE A CLOUD WAS FORMED AND THE AIR WAS FURTHER DIMINISHED BY ABOUT ONEFIFTH THE REMAINING AIR WAS GOOD DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR IN THIS EXPERIMENT THEREFORE THE LITMUS WAS IF NOT BURNT AT LEAST DECOMPOUNDED SO AS TO LOSE ENTIRELY ITS PURPLE COLOUR AND TO YIELD FIXED AIR SO THAT THOUGH SOAPLEES CANNOT BE DECOMPOUNDED BY THIS PROCESS YET THE SOLU TION OF LITMUS CAN AND SO VERY LIKELY MIGHT THE SOLUTIONS OF MANY OTHER COMBUSTIBLE SUBSTANCES BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN ANY OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WHICH FAVOURS THE OPINION OF THE AIR BEING AT ALL DIMINISHED BY MEANS OF PHLOGISTON COMMUNICATED TO IT BY THE ELECTRIC SPARKFIG

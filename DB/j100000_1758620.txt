about 80000 Be this as it may it is certain that the fertile island of Yezo which is appreciated in a certain way by the Japanese but which is very irrationally and imperfectly utilized is very thinly populated The island has an area of nearly 80000 0 kilometres and a population of only about two to the square kilometre The Ainos  whose unsophisticated artlessness love of truth peaceful disposition hospitality and discreet modest and sober deportment by contrast with other orientals strike one all the more agreeably  show in their short but wellproportioned body thick and beautiful hair and physiognomy particularly in the deepset eyes unmistakable agreements with people of more western countries say central Asia In language as well as customs and traditions they are decidedly strangers to the Japanese but so peaceful are they they submit freely to the yoke that has been placed upon them without ever plotting mischief Whether for them as well as for the rich natural advantages of the island of Yezo a colonization in European fashion would be a great benefit in com parison with that of the Japanese who have much to learn and much to do for a long time to come in their own country may here be left undecided However such a wish will certainly appear natural to all those who have gained a more intimate acquaint ance with the island of Yezo and its inhabitants INFLUENCE OF THE VA GUS NERVE UPON THE HEART IN continuation of his studies upon the physiology of the frogs heart Lowit confirms 1 Gaskells discov ery that in normal diastole the cardiac muscle is not completely relaxed but in a state of slight tonic contraction this Lowit finds is abolished during vagus inhibition The powerful beats which usually follow a period of inhibition must be due to some cliange in the heartmuscle and not in its motor nerve centres for Kronecker has proved that every cardiac contraction is maximal Their cause Lowit finds in the more complete diastolic expansion and he also explains similarly the more vigorous pulsa tions sometimes seen during a vagus stimulation not powerful enough to alter the hearts rate of beat He confirms Schiffs usually ignored discovery that stimulating the pneumogastric sometimes quickens the pulse but after a careful study of the circum stances under which this phenomenon occurs he rejects Schiffs hypothesis that the vagus contains only one set of heart nervefibres whose action varies with degree of stimulation etc We must assume two distinct sets of fibres  a cardioaccelerator and a cardioinhibitory the latter are more irritable but more easily injured bearing thus the same relation ship to the accelerator fibres as do the vasoconstric tory nerves to the vasodilator according to Goltz By exposing the frogs vagus to the action of sub stances as nitre which are known to diminish nerve irritability one can turn the vagus into a pulse quickening nerve on washing out the nitre it again becomes pulseslowing and so back and forth several times until deathchanges commence In mammalia thle phenomenon cannot be reproduced with the same certainty but occasionally one can succeed in getting the vagus into a condition in which its inhibitory fibres are not irritable while the accelerator are During vagus acceleration the 1 Pfliigers archiv xxix 469 VOL I No 8 frogs ventricle becomes paler indicating a con tracted condition of its musculature even in diastole This abnormal state of tonic contraction is not the cause of the acceleration for the pallor may precede the pulsequickening or last after it and weak stim uli sometimes cause acceleration with no pallor The small pulsations usually seen during the accel eration are due to the increased tonicity of the heart muscle usually present at the same time and pre venting diastolic relaxation of normal extent The accelerator fibres probably act on motornerve centres in the heart arousing processes whicb when feeble merely alter the rate of beat when more powerful also increase the tonus of the heartmuscle H NEWELL MARTIN THE EXTINCT LAKE AGASSIZ IN the recently published Tenth annual report of the geological and naturalhistory survey of Minneso ta for 1S81 Prof N H Winchell gives an abstract p 5 of Mr Warren Uphams observations on the shorelines of the great sheet of water that once flood ed the valley of the Red River of the North and over flowed southward into the Minnesota The lake had three stationary periods forming three beaches They all ascend above a given datum level toward the north the rate increasing in going toward the north The highest beachline ascends 125 feet in about 150 miles the beach being one continuous shoreline The northern portion of the lake fell at intervals from this high beachline    while the waterlevel in the extreme southern part stood nearly stationary the northern fractional beaches converging into one toward the southern extremity of the lake The next distinct beach found in the southerii part of the re gion ascends toward the north 70 feet in 150 miles    The fall of the lake had therefore been sixty feet more at the northern than at the southern end    The third beachline formed when the outlet had been excavated to the level of Lake Traverse is known along a distance of 135 miles and its north ward ascent was at first 50 feet and afterwards only about 25 feet  The fall of Lake Agassiz from the highest beach level to the third at Lake Traverse was about 80 feet and in the vicinity of Maple Lake 165 feet    These phenomena seem inconsistent with that hypothesis which supposes an elevation of northern land as a barrier to contain this vast inland lake inasmuch as these beaches would have to pre sent a slope in the opposite lirection in order to change the outlet from Lake Traverse to Hudsons Bay   They have been ascribed to the operation of the glacial period in the epoch of its decline when the ice still existed toward the north as a barrier to prevent northern drainage    and in the opinion of Mr Upham its attraction was sufficient to move the mass of water toward itself and to cause an ascending shoreline in that direction    Lake Agassiz probably covered Red Lake under 50 or 100 feet of water above its present level Lake of the Woods under about 200 feet the Red River Valley at St Vincent 450 feet and Lake Winnipeg about 600 feet The area thus flooded is much larger than heretofore supposed LETTERS TO TIlE EDITOR Movement of the arms in walking IT seems to me I can best lay this ghost of our ani mal origin by drawing attention to the fact that the

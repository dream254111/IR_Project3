ClientNegligence in Examining TitleIn Jacob sen v Peterson 103 Atl 983 the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that an attorney who is employed to investigate the title to real estate is liable for any injury that may result to his client from negligence in the performance of his duties The court said It is the duty of an attorney who is employed to investigate the title to real estate to make a painstaking exam ination of the record and to report all facts relating to the title He is therefore liable for any injury that may result to his client from negligence in the performance of his duties that is from a failure to exercise ordinary care and skill in discovering in the rec ords and reporting all the deeds mortgages judgments etc that affect the title in respect to which he is employed Economy B  L Assn v West Jersey Title Co 64 N J Law 27 44 Atl 854 In the present case it appeared and the trial judge properly found that the defendant negligently overlooked and failed to report a judgment for 380 which was a lien upon the land tie title of which he was employed to examine and which the plaintiff pur chased in reliance upon the defendants report and without knowl edge of the existence of such judgment There was therefore no question as to the defendants liability The question arises What was the measure of damages Where as here an attorney negligently omits to report the fact of a judgment which is a lien upon real estate the title of which he was employed to investigate and his client purchases such real es tate in reliance upon such report and without knowledge of such judgment the measure of damages is the amount his client is caused to pay out to remove the lien of such judgment But it ap peared that the plaintiff subsequently sold the real estate for a sum in excess of its total cost to him including the discharge of the judgment and the trial judge considered that this justified the award of nominal damages only Not so The measure of dam ages was not affected by the sale It will not do to say that in or der for a client to recover for such negligence he must either sell the property at a loss or not sell it at all He was entitled to all the profit he would have made by the transaction if the title had been as represented ElectricityLiability of Telephone Company for Injury to Li censee Using Private PhoneIn Inman v Home Telephone  Telegraph Co 177 Pac 670 it was held that where a neighbor of one with telephone service secured permission to use phone and was injured by electric shock she could not recover from telephone5 VIR INIA LAW REGISTER N S company in the absence of proof that the injaries were willful wan ton or malicious The court said The telephone unlike other electrically oper ated instruments is not highly dangerous in that its wires do not carry a dangerous current so we have eliminated from our consid eration those cases of liability of conveyers of high electric current for injuries to trespassers licensees children etc and have only to determine the rights under the Fortune contract Cumberland Telegraph  Telephone Co v Martins Admr 116 Ky 554 76 S W 3914 77 S W 718 63 L R A 469 105

negligence to the Fortune family its servants guests persons working about the house for the benefit and at the request of the owner and all persons who could be said to have been in the contemplation

contemplation of the contract the company in order to be liable for their injury must be shown to have been more than merely negligent The plaintiffs were accustomed to use this telephone and Fortune had established in effect for them a free telephone service This he could not do for no such use of this telephone was reasonable or anticipated by the company when it was in stalled or sanctioned thereafter It may be that in public or business places such use is taken into consideration when telephones are placed there and that the company is liable to such users as to subscribers but the private residence in thq absence of agreement to that effect is not sup posed to be a public telephone station Those using such tele phones for purposes of their own and not in the interest of the owner of the house and for their own convenience and not casu ally and not as members of the household either permanently or temporarily are at best as far as the company is involved bare li censees

TransactionsLoan to Pay Gaming DebtIn Pennsyl vania Railroad Company v Rosenfeld C C A 249 Fed 964 it was held that one who lends money to the loser in an illegal transaction such as gaming or betting can recover the loan notwithstanding he knows that the loser is going to pay his indebtedness with it The court said The circumstances out of which the claim arose are peculiar One Rodgers had what is known as a phone room in which he made bets on horse races over the telephone Philip S Abrahams was in the habit of bringing him bets of third parties for which service Rodgers paid him a commission of 5 per cent December 11 1915 Rodgers gave Abrahams a check for 1632 to cover bets which he had lost to one Davis and the com mission of 5 per cent This check being unpaid Abrahams paid Davis Rodgers lost additional bets with Davis to the amount of 1180 and on December 23 1915 gave Abrahams a bill of sale which was filed in the registers office for two locomotives and other property with instructions to raise enough money upon therf to pay off the indebtedness of 2812 and expenses any surplus to go to Rodgers December 24th Abrahams transfered this bill of sale by a separate writing which was not filed to the plaintiff Minnie Rosenfeld to secure the repayment of 2000 previously ad vanced by her arid applied by Abrahams to paying Rodgers bets and a further present advance of 900 to Rodgers Plaintiff knew that the moneys advanced by her were to be used to pay indebted ness incurred in gaming March 10 1916 Abrahams sold the two locomotives to the General Equipment Company of New York for 3000 with the approval of the plaintiff who did not wish to ap pear in the transaction but before delivery Rodgers sold them to the Vulcan Iron Works of Chicago and delivered them to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for shipment The plaintiff demanded possession of them from the company which refused to deliver them whereupon this action was brought The real defense is that the plaintiff cannot recover because of  993 of the Penal Law of New York Consol Laws c 40 which reads All things in action judgments mortgages conveyances and every other security whatsoever given or executed by any 85 1919 I

j100358,The School Review,1074206,Changes in the Regents Syllabus,i244527,CHANGES IN THE REGENTS SYLLABUS WITH the university convocation held at Albany last June it may be said that the work of revising the 1900 edition of the regents syllabus closed In I895 the associated academic principals appointed a com mittee of three to represent them in the work of revision While this committee had no original authority yet from the outset its work with the officers of the board of regents has been the closest and its suggestions to them have been received with the greatest consideration and in a majority of instances approved The committee began its work by mailing a letter of inquiry to every principal superintendent and college president of the state These replies were carefully studied The number of letters and circulars relating to the work which the committee sent out exceeds two thousand not including the letters and cir culars necessary in the work of the subcommittees on English history mathematics and science For the past two years the subject of  Syllabus Revision has had a prominent place on the programs at the principals con ference and at convocation The committee has made four reports These reports have been published in different educa tional magazines and in the proceedings of the bodies receiving the report Before the final report was made at the principals conference last December a circular containing a summary of the proposed changes was mailed to every principal superin tendent and college president in the state and to several promi nent school men in other states This summary was discussed in detail by the conference Special reports also have been made upon literature history mathematics and science and published in the proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Confer ence of the Associated Academic Principals There has been SCHOOL REVIEW October I899 New York Education March I899 Convoca tion Proceedings I898 I899 Proceedings of Academic Principals Conference 1898 I889 405THE SCHOOL REVIEW an attempt to make the revision in the interest of all concerned and to give the widest publicity to the proposed changes In addition to the above the director of the highschool depart ment of the University of the State of New York in his report for 1898 pages 384388 gives a summary of the proposed changes up to that date In April of the present year an edi tion of the new syllabus has been published and circulated as  Proof Under Revision Criticism has been invited and many valuable suggestions have been thus received It is highly creditable to the authors of the 1895 edition that five years use revealed so few things to be changed The bulk of the 1895 edition stands with few changes in the 1900 revision During the last few years educational thought has been largely directed by the strong reports of committees carefully chosen by representative educational bodies to study particular phases of education These reports have influenced to a large degree the revision of the syllabus particularly so the report of the Committee of Ten the Committee on College Entrance Requirements the Committee of Fifteen the Columbia Confer ence and the Committee of Seven As a result of the work of the regents office and the principals committee we have the present edition which among other changes contain the fol lowing The preacademic studies remain the same but the instruction is supposed to include more of history civics and drawing than heretofore No separate examinations will be given in these branches for the next five years but it is highly probable that in the I905 revision all three will be included in the preliminaries the subjects covered by the first eight years of school work While this change does not meet the requirements of the Com mittee of Fifteen yet it is a long step in that direction It also helps to enrich the grammarschool course with the essentials for intelligent citizenship Emphasis is laid upon the avoidance of puzzles in arithmetic and upon the omission of useless details in geography The number of academic studies has been reduced from 75 to 6I as scheduled in former editions and raised from 6I to 406CHANGES IN THE REGENTS SYLLABUS 74 by the addition of the commercial branches manual training and Spanish A special syllabus has been issued for the work in manual training and another for the commercial work The following tables are the three most important summaries contained in the 224 pages of the new syllabus and will be most frequently consulted REGENTS SYSTEM OF

fouryear courses are offered in English These courses are so arranged that schools desiring full year courses in literature may take one line of work while those whose local conditions require them to follow a different line of work may take the half year courses Throughout the four years the courses are so arranged that students may pass from one to the other without loss A threeyear course in Spanish has been added to the modern foreign languages This addition was made to meet the demand growing out of our newly established commercial relations in Cuba Porto Rico and the Philippines The courses in German French and Spanish are designed to require as much and as careful work as is given to three years study of Latin Instead of giving two short Ioweek courses in Trigonometry one of twenty weeks is offered A twentyweeks course in business arithmetic is also offered No other changes were made in the mathematical group of studies Continuous courses of one year are offered in physics and chemistry An attempt has been made to meet the demand for longer courses in these subjects than has been heretofore givenCHANGES IN THE REGENTS SYLLABUS At the same time by giving an examination both in January and June those schools that are unable to provide adequate equip ment for a years course are not barred from doing the one half year work It is hoped that this change will be an inducement to teach more of one science and not attempt so large a variety The syllabus advises that a twentyweeks course in physical geography be offered and when practical that it be followed by a twentyweeks course in geology thus giving a year to the earth sciences For the first time notebooks will form a prominent feature of the examinations These will be noted by the state inspector of his regular visits The principal will certify that they have been properly kept and will hold himself in readiness to forward upon demand these notebooks to the regents office for inspection In botany special emphasis is laid upon the study of the life process of plants In physiology stress is laid on the cell theory and upon the digestive processes Attention is called to the different kinds of foods and their relative digesti bility and the simple experiments illustrating physiologic phenomena The history group came in for a considerable share of revision Under existing conditions more credit could be obtained from a single years work in history by one half than in any other department There were plenty of instances on record where the student of general history devoting only the time allotted for that subject had not only passed his general history but had also passed and received full credit for Greek Roman and French history while New York state history was passed in an astonishing number of instances with barely one weeks study The problem then in the revision of the history syllabus was how to arrange a course that would be satisfactory and complete and avoid existing pitfalls The result of the dis cussion was general history French history New Ycfrk state his tory and the reading courses in United States history were dropped The outline in United States history simplified enlarging the requirements for biographic reading and adding the elements of civil government In place of general history has been inserted Medieval Greek and Roman history together 4IITHE SCHOOL REVIEW form a full year course Medieval and English history also form a year course and advanced American history and civics including national finance and the principles of economics form a third year Possibly the most radical changes in the arrangement of studies is found in the last group This has been brought about by the addition of courses of manual training and commerce Heretofore comparatively few schools have attempted manual training It is hoped that the recognition of the work by the the state will encourage this branch of education While a large number of schools have had a socalled commercial course yet they have been in most instances but mere smatterings of book keeping and a few other branches making it necessary for that student who wanted a more thorough business education to go to a commercial school It was difficult to ascertain the reason why high schools should continue to prepare students for com mercial schools The present syllabus makes it possible for all schools who are able to support a four years commercial course to do so and receive the state business diploma the highest busi ness credential given in the state The syllabus in drawing has been entirely revised and mod ernized Plates selected for study as appeared in the I895 revision have been omitted Standard works covering the whole field are recommended as a part of the equipment for drawing in secondary schools There has been no change made in the names of the creden tials to be given but any foreign language may be substituted for English in any credential This removes the heretofore exist ing handicap of the student who elected the old or new classical course This change does not prevent the classical student from studying English It simply does not require him to do so in order to graduate The assumption being that in a fouryears secondary course if seven twelfths of the time is to be given up to the study of foreign languages that of the remaining five twelfths three of them should not be positively prescribed for further language study The quarrel if any exists is with those who insist upon spending upon Latin and Greek 1400 of the 412CHANGES IN THE REGENTS SYLLABUS 2400 hours of a secondary course or else it lies at the door of those who prevent the beginning of a foreign language in the eighth year The daily program has been materially changed placing the eleventh and twelfth subjects or the junior and senior years of the high school in the forepart of the week the preliminaries first and second year highschool subjects in the later part This change is made in order that students who expect to graduate and in those localities where graduation depend upon passing the state examination may know as early as possible the result of their work The special topic plan is discontinued and last but by no means least grants of public money will hereafter be made upon the basis of academic attendance September I saw the new syllabus in force Its success can only be determined after it has passed through the crucible of the class room F D BOYNTON Chairman Committee from Academic Principals ITHACA HIGH SCHOOL

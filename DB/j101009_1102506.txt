losing his liberty instructed the Circuit Court to issue a writ of protection prohibiting apprehen sion of petitioner during the time necessary for him to attend trial MISCELLANY Wager of Battle in the YearBooksThe new volume of Year Books 20 Edward III edited by Mr Owen Pike contains a cu rious account of the manner of joining the wager of battle on a writ of Right The matter in controversy was ten acres of meadowland The tenant in possessionAmeets the claim with a precise point blank denial and says he will deny it by the body of his freeman one H by name who is here ready to deny it by his body or in what soever way the Court shall adjudge And As champion was bare headed and with his sleeves unfastened and his sleeves were turned up on his arms and he had in his right hand a glovefolded and in each finger of the glove there was one penny and he proffered the glove to the Court but he did not throw it into the Court until the other party had joined the wager of battle The claimants champion in due course threw forward a glove folded and then the tenants cham pion threw forward his glove and the Court accepted both taking pledges of claimant and tenant that they would carry out the battle and that neither of the champions should injure or molest the other either secretly or openly which pledges they gave Then the gloves were redelivered to the champions and the parties were told that they must pay strict attention to the champions and keep their day of battle on the morrow of All Souls The explanation of the five pennies in each glove was a religious one They were to be after wards offered in honour of the Saviours five wounds so that God might allow the victory to be given to the champion who had right on his side It is this appeal to Heaven to defend the right in the wager of battle which saves its character as a judicial proceeding It is really the old ordeal adapted to a martial agenot fire or water the test but arms There is another somewhat amusing case in the same volume illustrating the wager of battle A citizen of London appealed one of robbery The appellee denied the charge and of fered to deraign or prove his denial by his body Then the citizen of London seems to have thought better of it and pleaded the priv ilege of the citizen of London never to have battle waged against any one of them in relation to a felony The appellee insisted that the appellor had gone too far to go back and claimed judgment of battle Thereupon the citizen made an adroit move in the game by getting the citizens of London to intervene and urge that he could Nov

of battle translated to the Victorian eraThe Law Journal London Professional Ethics in South AfricaIt is always interesting and occasionally illuminating to get a glimpse of ourselves as others see us The following view of professional ethics in America is from the South African Law Journal Professional EthicsReduction to a CodeWe notice with marked interest a movement which has been started by the legal profession in America to reduce to writing in the form of a code those unwrit ten rules governing the conduct of lawyers which are generally spoken of as professional ethics    Whether these rules will work as well in practice as they read in theory is another question What rights has a lawyer got who loses a case in court The code of prafessional ethics says One side must always lose the cause and it is not wise or respectful to the court for attorneys to display temper because of an adverse ruling When this rule was proposed for adoption in Maryland objection was taken to it by Chief Justice McSherry that it meant a very serious interference with the rights of practitioners in Western Maryland for it had been the timehonoured lex non scripta there that when a lawyer lost a case he had one of three remedies open to himeither he could curse the court for thirty days or he could get drunk for three days or he could appeal Only when he exceeded a time limit or claimed more than one of these remedies did he commit a contempt of court Notwithstanding this objection the rule was passed and it is not recorded that Chief Justice McSherry voted against it So far as our research has led us in South Africa we have not been able to find any similar custom anywhere but should such a custom exist we doubt not that those claiming privileges under it will make them selves heard when a codification of our professional ethics comes about In more serious mood however we have to confess that notwith standing the feeling of the profession in America we are not by any means convinced that our system which to all intents and purposes makes our various Supreme Courts the judges of what is and what is not professional conduct on the part of a lawyer is not the better one Bar Association in EnglandEvidently our English brethren who are solicitors make their association one of activity and usefulness Our barristers seem to resemble ourselves Might we not take a leaf out of the solicitors book The annual report just issued of the Council of the Law Society 614 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER contains a record of work done and reforms initiated which contrasts strongly with the report of the General Council of the Bar presented to its members last April and if any argument were needed for equality of treatment of both branches of the professione g on the Rule Committeeit is surely afforded by the evidences of activity and sustained interest which abound on every page of this report The Law Societys Council has met thirtysix times as against the fifteen meetings of the Bar Council it has some eighteen committees for special purposes as against the four standing committees of the Bar and the number of meetings of these special committees has been two hundred and twentyone compared with the thirtythree of the other body The nature and volume of the work done have been in similar proportions The question of internal reform has been boldly tackled by the passing of resolutions proposed by the Council itself providing for the compulsory resignation of three of its members at each annual meeting and for the appointment of a joint committee of official and nonofficial members to select new candidates Steps have also been taken to enlarge the membership of the Societynow standing at 8611by an alteration of the constitution Increased grants have been made to various provincial law societies to the scholarship funds and for fees to tutors and examiners The teach ing system and the methods of examination have been largely modi fied and improved always in the direction of a raised standard of education and a coordination of work with the universities and local colleges Legislation affecting the profession has not only watched but actively intervened in or promoted and the Society has taken a prominent part in the movement for securing an inquiry into the working of the Land Transfer Acts and an improvement in the system of registration of titles The same close and even anxious consideration has been given to all proposed Rules of Court with results favourable not only to solicitors for whom the Society is mainly concerned but to all members of the profession And the Bar Council itself has not escaped the attention of this active and earnest body for its failure to take any steps to carry out Sir Robert Finlays scheme for a School of law or even to discuss it at its an nual meeting finds room for comment in this annual report and the Council though it now benefits so largely from the pecuniary point of view by the scheme being held in abeyance expresses the hope that the scheme may be revived at an early date Here are points of contrast enough with the meagre account of work done on behalf of the Bar by its representative body If the example of the Law So ciety were followed by the superior branch many of the problems which concern the profession as a whole would soon be brought to a satisfactory solutionThe Law Journal London

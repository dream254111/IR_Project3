VILLAGE COMMUNITY The English village community examined in its rela tions to the manorial and tribal systems and to the common or open field system of husbandry an essay in economic history By FREDERIC SEE BOHM London Longmans Green  Co 1883 464 p 13 maps and plates 8 IT is now many years since G L von Maurer wrote his Introduction to the history of marks and manors Since then the subject has attracted many students and has been much looked into and talked about Many books have been written upon it those of Nasse de Laveleye and Maine being the best known to American readers The impression con veyed by these writings is that the mark or village community though almost always found upon a manor under manorial overlord ship was in its origin independent Manorial overlordship arose we are told in later times The village community was drawn under it and became subject to it It has been the work of modern times to restore it to its ancient independence This is the theory of von Maurer and his followers which we have gathered from their books Objections to this theory are from time to time raised It is urged that the village community is usually found under manorial landlordship that it is therefore an open question whether the village community or the landlordship over it is the earlier institution In Mr Seebohms book which now lies before us it is maintained that landlordship is more ancient than the village community that the village community arose under landlordship as a community of slaves or serfs that it has been slowly emancipated from slavery and from serfdom in the course of centuries Our economic history we are told begins with the serfdom of the masses un der manorial landlordship Looking through the records back to the earliest period we find no free village communities only manors with village communities in villenage upon them The argument upon this point is almost con clusive The existence of a manorial system during the Saxon period of our history is established beyond doubt N CE VOL II No 32 But there were parts of Britain which were not manorial where village communities the village community being considered a part of the manor did not exist What was there in the parts of Britain where there were no manors  By the side of the manorial system was a tribal system more ancient perhaps than the mano rial system Then follows an account of the tribal system of the Welsh and Irish which is extremely interesting It is not clear at first why in a work upon English economic history so much space should be given to the institu tions of the Welsh and Irish but we find out directly it is that we may the more clearly understand the statements of Caesar and Taci tus regarding the Germans It is well known that the statements of Caesar and Tacitus are very vague that they become intelligible only in the light of extraneous evidence We ourselves should not have presumed to draw this evidence from the Welsh laws nor from the Brehon tracts It has always seemed to us best to keep the records of different peoples quite distinct We should therefore have turned from Caesar and Tacitus to the German folklaws formulae and documents The tri bal system of the Germans is very well de scribed in the German records It happens however that the tribal system of the Germans resembles very closely that of the Welsh and Irish so though we do not follow all the steps of Mr Seebohms argument we come at last to very nearly the same conclusion What we have in the time of Caesar and Tacitus and afterwards in many places where the manorial system has not been developed are tribal households to use Mr Seebohms phrase isolated farmsteads occupied by groups of de scendants and heirs the land being held by them as an undivided inheritance for two or three generations and then divided several households arising where there was but one before Mr Seebohm finds a vestige of this system in the custom of Gavelkind in Kent where we have divisions among male heirs with traces of the right of the youngest to the original homestead Almost everywhere else in England the tribal system has quite passed away Already however in the time of Tacitus the manorial system was germinating The free tribesmen who lived in the tribal house holds here and there ut fons ut campus ut nemus placuit  had slaves who cultivated the land for them These slaves were dis tributed by the tribesmen in village com munities in regard to which they were very much in the position of the later manorial v  ISCIENCE lords It was only a step indeed from this condition of things to the manorial system This step was taken immediately after the permanent settlement of the Germans within the limits of the Roman empire The land system of the later empire was very much like a manorial system So it happened that while the Germans were approaching this sys tem on the one hand the Romans were ap proaching it on the other They reached it together This is the briefest possible rdsume of Mr Seebohms extremely interesting and valuable book The argument is well arranged and very convincing It is perhaps a little too much encumbered by details but we should be sorry not to have these details and the book is quite readable in spite of them The account of the manorial system is the most complete that we have The book is a mine of information upon the subject It will be found indispensable to students It is very well printed and illustrated by plates and maps It would be worth having for these alone In conclusion we must heartily con gratulate the writer upon the completion of so excellent and useful a work STEARNS AND COUES NEWENGLAND BIRDLIFE NewEngland birdlife being a manual of New England ornithology Revised and edited from the manuscript of Winfirid A Stearns by lr Elliott Coues Boston Lee   Shepard 1881 1883 324409 p l11ustr 8 UNDER this title Mr Winfrid A Stearns and Dr Elliott Cones have just produced an excellent and muchneeded work Previous to its appearance we have had no complete or satisfactory exposition of the subject despite several attempts on the part of inexperienced or otherwise incompetent authors to cover the interesting field hence thelresent book is doubly welcome It has appeared in two volumes or parts Part i issued two years ago begins with Turdidae or thrushes and carries the subject through Oscines ending with the family Corvidae In addition to the 270 pages occu pied by its main portion there is an  Intro duction  of fifty pages which includes useful chapters on the classification and structure of birds the Preparation of specimens for study  the  Subject of faunal areas  and tlhe Literature of NewEngland ornithology Including those devoted to its special index as well as to the introduction part i conttins 324 pages Part ii was published early in the present year It has in all 409 pages of which tenl are occupied by an  editors preface and eight by the index the remaining 397 pages treating the general subject fiom Tyrannidaec through the successive families to Alecidae last and lowest in the scale of NewEngland bird life Both volumes are rather copiously illus trated with fairly good woodcuts some of which are fulllength figures others represen tations of the heads feet wings etc of birds designed to show technical or distinguishing characters Most of these cuts have done similar duty before but on this account they are none the less useful in the present connec tion The plan of the book is so clearly and tersely outlined in the preface to lart i that we cannot do better than give it in the editors own words  It is the object of the present volume to go care fully over the whole ground and to present in con cise and convenient form an epitome of the birdlife of New Eingland The claims of each species to be considered a member of tIhe NewEngland fauna are critically exaimined and not one is admitted upoJn insufficient evidence of its occurrencee within this area the design being to give a thoroughly reliable list of the birds with an account of the leading facts in the lifehistory of each species The plain of tlhe work includes brief descriptions of the birds them selves enabling one to identify any specimen he may have in hand tihe local distribution migration and relative abundance of every species togetlher with as much general informtation respectiig their habits as can conveniently be brought within the compass of a handbook of NewEnglanid ornithology This plan is consistently and faithfully car ried out The descriltions of the birds to be sure are a little meagre and unsatisfactory at times but it must be remembered that they are intended primarily for a class of amateurs who are not fitted either by experience or in clination to wade through more exact tech nical diagnoses The biographical matter is written in the editors wellknown and eminently character istic style a style not wholly free from faults perhaps but in the main so finished and picturesque that it is sure to attract and interest every lover of birds In the present instance the only fault we have to find with these biographies is that they are often too brief and general  in short that there is too much condensation Especially is this the case among waterbirds where the account of habits distribution etc is frequently crowded into a few lines Doubtless this was necessary SEPTEMIBER 14 1S83 357

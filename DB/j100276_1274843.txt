FROM SER vICEWhere a nonresident plaintiff in an action pending in the United States Court for the Southern District of Iowa employed an attorney who resided in Illinois the question was whether such attorney was exempt from service of process in a civil suit while in attendiance on court anfd for a reasonable time thereafter Held that ihe was thus exempt Read v Neff et al I913 207 Fed 89o At common law the rule was that an attorney Wvhile in attendance on court was exempt from arrest on civil process but this exemption did not extend to the service of process which did not involve arrest 3 BLACKSTONE COMM 289 Greenleaf v Peoples Bank 133 N C 298 98 Am St Rep 709 63 L R A 499 There are a few courts which have extended this exemption in the case of nonresident attorneys to the service lof ordinary civil process Hoffman v Bay Circuit Judge 113 Mich Io9 Commonweealth v Ronald 4 iCall Va 97 Whitman v Sheets 20 O C C I II O C D I79 In Central Trust Co v Milwaukee St Ry Co 74 Fed 442 it was held that a nonresident attorney was exempt from the service of a subpoena for witness duty It is submitted that the cases which announce the contrary rule are more in accord with the theory upon which exemptions are founded Tihe courts have always main tained that exemptions were allowed because they were absolutely necessary in order that justice might not be impeded It was for this reason that it was not permissible to arrest an attorney while engaged in court On the other hand the service of ordinary civil process in no way prevents the attorney from performing his duties It does not seem reasonable that one class of persons should be less amenable to the courts than other classes whose busineiss within the state may be just as urgent and to whom freedom from suit in a foreign jurisdiction would be just as great a boon For a full discussion of the subject see Greenleaf v Peoples Bank supra Also Tyrone Bank v Doty I2 Pa Co Ct 287 Robbins v Lincoln 27 Fed 342 AuTOMOBtIESRIGHT OF OWNER TO RECOVER FOR INJURY TO UNREGISTERED MACHINEIn a suit to recover for the negligent injury to an automobile the failure to have the machine registered was interposed as a defense A statute made it unlawful for an unregistered automobile to be on the highway Held that failure to register is no defense Birmingham Ry Lt  Power Co v Aetna Acc  L Ins Co Ala 1913 64 SIO 44 The precise question is presented for the ifirst time in this jurisdiction although the court fiollows its earlier construction of a similar statute making unlawful the presence of straying cattle on the highway A G S R R Co v McAlpine 71 Ala 545 The cases in the other states are in conflict Those in accord with the instant case take the position that in order to bar recovery the failure to register must have some causal connection with the injury Atlantic C L Ry v Weir 63 Fla 69 4I L R A N S 307 Lindsay vRECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS Cecchi Del 8o Atl 523 35 L R A NS 699 The cases taking the oppo site view

disclosed Walters v Zimmerman et al D C N D Ohio I913 208 Fed 62 The rule as thus laid down is too broad and is not applicable to the facts in the principal case A mere suspicion of insolvency is not sufficient to put a creditor upon inquiry as to the insolvency of his debtor In re Eggert 102 Fed 735 Crooks v Peoples Bank 72 N Y App 331 3 Am B R 238 The creditor must have knowledge of such facts as would put a reasonable man on inquiry as to the solvency of his debtor And where such inquiry pursued to its legitimate conclusion would disclose insolvency such creditor has reason able cause to believe his debtor insolvent Hackney v Raymond 68 Neb 624 Io Am B R 213 Bardes v Bank 122 Ia 443 On the whole reasonable cause is a question of fact to be determined under all the circumstances of the

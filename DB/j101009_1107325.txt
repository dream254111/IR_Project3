Aliens to Appeal from Ad verse JudgmentRau v Rowe Ky 213 S W 226 was an action by the widow of an intestate to subject to her clainis a part of in testates estate inherited by nonresident alien defendants whose re lation to the case was purely defensive It was held that they were not barred of their right to appeal from an adverse judgment by rea son of the declaration of war by the United States against their coun try prior to rendering of the judgment The rule that the liability of an alien enemy to be sued carries with it the right to all means of defenses includes appeal as one of the means of defense The court said From the multitude of cases found on this sub ject the following general principles seem to have received full rec ognition in England Canada and the United States First that a person of enemy nationality resident in his own country can neither institute an action in the courts of the country with which his own is at war during the continuance of the war nor prosecute one insti tuted before its commencement but such disability continues only while he is abiding in his own country and consequently does not exist where he is permitted to enter and remain in the country in which suit is brought unless while therein he is carrying on trade with the enemy country is a spy or has been guilty of other acts of hostility Brandon v Nexbill 2 Eng Rul Cas 649

Wilcox v Henry 1 Dall 69 1 L Ed 41 Second that where during the pendency of an action the plaintiff becomes an alien enemy the court is without legal authority to render judgment and in such state of case a judg ment rendered in a cause commenced before the beginning of the war can have no legal validity In some jurisdictions the rule is that where an action has been commenced before the war the proceeding will be only suspended but if instituted after the beginning of the war it will be dismissed In yet other jurisdictions it has been held that where the plaintiff becomes an alien enemy after the institution of the action it should be continued on the docket or dismissed wth out prejudice Hutchinson v Brock 11 Mass 119 Bell v Chapman 10 Johns N Y 183 Korzinske v Harris Cont Co 18

NOTES OF CASES 467 right to use all the means and appliances of defense that might be employed by a resident citizen of the country in which the action is brought In other words although the existence of war closes the courts of each belligerent to the citizens of the other it does not pre vent the citizens of one belligerent when sued from taking proceed ings for the protection of their own property against the citizens of the other when sued by the latter for the reason of policy which suspends the right of action of any enemy alien during the war can not and does not apply where the suit is not by one of the enemy to collect his own resources but to subject the property of the alien to a demand asserted against him As said in Russ v Mitchell 11 Fla 80 It would be revolting to the rules of justice which govern a court to drag therein a party and then say to him Although you are properly before the court you are an alien enemy and shall not be heard yet judgment shall be rendered against you In Dorsey v Thompson 37 Md 25 the rule referred to is stated as follows Whether the grounds of the defense of alien enemy be the possible benefit that might result to the enemy from allowing the plaintiff to recover or the want of claim or right to the use of the courts of the country by the plaintiff in consequence of his status as an enemy the reason that creates the disability of the party as plain tiff does not apply to him as defendant As plaintiff the party at tempts to exercise a privilege that he has forfeited at least for the time but as defendant he is sought to be made amenable for what justice may require of him The mode and manner of acquiring jurisdiction and making the proceedings binding on him is another and different question from that of his total exemption from suit pending hostili ties This depends upon the remedial processes of the courts and as is well known they are generally wholly inadequate during a state of actual war in suits in personam to furnish the foundation for exercising jurisdiction over alien enemies residing in the enemys territory But still these enemies are liable to be sued if within the reach of process

Eng 857 A leading case on the question under consideration is that of McVeiglh v United States 78 U S 11 Wall 259268 20 L Ed 80 the action being one brought during the Civil War under an act of Congress passed in 1862 to confiscate for the purpose of the United States Government certain property within its territory belonging to McVeigh then a resident of the city of Richmond Va within the Confederate lines and designated a rebel Being constructively in court McVeigh filed an answer asserting his right to the property and resisting that of the United States to deprive him of it The5 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S court below struck the answer from the files and entered a decree for the sale of the property In reversing the judgment and setting aside the sale of the property the Supreme Court of the United States in part said In our judgment the district court committed a serious error in ordering the claim and answer of the respondefit to be stricken from the files As we are unanimous in this conclu sion our opinion will be confined to that subject The order in ef fect denied the respondent a hearing It is alleged that he was in the position of an alienenemy and answer could have no locus standi in that forum If assailed there he could defend there The liability and the right are inseparable A different result would be a blot upon our jurisprudence and civilization    Whatever may be the extent of the disability of an alien enemy to sue in the courts of the hostile country it is clear that he is liable to be sued and this carries with it the right to use all the means and appliances of defense In the subsequent case of Windsor v McVeigh 93 U S 274 23 L Ed 914 involving the title to the same property the case of Mc Veigh v United States supra was cited and the above principle therein announced was approved in the following language Wher ever one is assailed in his person or his property there he may de fend for the liability and the right are inseparable This is a prin ciple of natural justice recognized as such by the common intelli gence and conscience of all nations In the still later case of Hovey v Elliott 167 U S 409 17 Sup Ct 841 42 L Ed 215 the Supreme Court of the United States cited the McVeigh Case and after discussing at length numerous au thorities strongly approved its statement of the doctrine in question In Buford v Speed 11 Bush 338 we held that quoting from the syllabus The provision of the Federal Constitution declaring that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law is applicable to alien enemies and gives them the right when proceeded against by legal process to appear in per son or by counsel whom they have a right to employ and to intro duce evidence and make defense and further that where a husband left his wife in possession of his property and joined the Confeder ate Army and proceedings to confiscate his property were instituted in the Federal court under the act of Congress the wife had au thority by implication of law to employ the ordinary means of mak ing defense by hiring and contracting to pay counsel and he is bound by her action whether she had express authority or not  Constitutional LawReferendum of Amendment to Federal Con stitutionIn State z Howell 181 Pac 920 the Supreme Court of Xaslhiigton leld that under a state constitutional provision for

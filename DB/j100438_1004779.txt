DEAR SIR I now forward a continuation of my astronomical obser vations made at this place they would have been more nu merous lhad the weather permitted The season has been re markably unfavourable for suclh pursuits The results of the observations on the solar eclipse of the 21st of February the occultations the 30th of March 27th of May and 23d of September last I have not as yet had time to make outthe duties of my office admitting of but little leisure for scientific enquiriesBut to the obser vations Feb 21st 1803 Observationson the beginning of a solar eclipse The day was cloudy till about half an hour before the be ginning of the eclipse on which account I lhad made no preparations to observe itA few minutes before the time cal culated for the beginning I directed the telescope to the sun the lower limb was very tremulous and indented in many places by a waving serpentine motion which will frequently be observed when the sun is near the horizonthese indents combined with other causes produced an uncertainty of a few seconds though probaably not more than 10 or 12 in the beginning which I observed at 5h 4 57 mean time or 4h 50 57 apparent time R114 ASTRONOMICAL

light of the star and the moons limnb appear ed to be nearly in contact It is however to be observed that wlhen the emersions happen on the moons enlightened limb the observations may generally be considered doubtful a few seconds 0 Lorsque la lune a passe lopposition sa partie orientale est eclairee sa partie occidentale est obscure ainsi les immersions se font dans la partie eclairee et les

mean time or l4h 54 10 apparent timeThe night hlad become a little hazy and the belts were scarcely discernable The satellite appeared for a few seconds and then became in visible for more than a minute From the state of the atmos phere and the slow manner in which the satellite acquired its light owing to its oblique way through the shadow of Jupiter it is my opinion that at least 2 minutes should be deducted from the observed time of the emersion which deduction I shall accordingly use in making out the result of the observa tion May 2d Emersion of the 1st satellite of Jupiter observed

Saturn invisible thougli I loolked for it with both telescopes during the twilight anid half an hour after By the tlieory of Mr Sejour the disappearance of the ring oughit to have taken place on tlle 28tlht and perhaps witlh better telescopes that would have been the case for muclh depends upon the goodness of tllose instruments and the state of the atmosphere at the timne of making the obser vationsWithi Mr Herschels large telescope there is no real disappearance It is likewise possible that the difference be tween the disappearance as resulting from the theory and ob servation may in part be owing to a small retrogade motion in the nodes of the ring Sept 23d The moon occulted a star at Sh 431 5 1 mean time or 8h 51 28 apparent time The star is in the con stellation of Sagittarius i and supposed to be the one num bered 712 in Mayers catalogueit is of the 6th magnitude the star appeared to remain well defined 4 or 5 seconds on the moons limb but the disappearance was instantaneous I shall noNv after a preliminary observation proceed to state the results of the foregoing observations on the eclipses of Jupiters satellites as deduced both from Mr Delambres tables and the British nautical almanacAs a standard of comparison I shall consider the correct longitude of Lancas ter to be 5h 5i 411 west from the observatory at Greenwich and which I am persuaded will

appears to be Sh 5 10 west from Greenwich which exceeds the assumed standard 6 And if a mean of all the determina tions agreeably to the same tables be taken collectively the longitude will be 5h 5 41

the clock and replaced by a gridiron one but owing to the unfavourable situation of the clock I did not expect to derive any material advanitage from the change in this however I have been agreeably disappointed the ex treme variations from the mean rate of going for the whole year will not amount to 2 seconids notwithstanding the con The theory of the 4th satelilte of Jtupiter is a subject of peculiar nicety and has required great labour to bring it to its present degree of perfection for which we are principally indebted to the genius and industry of Mr Delambre An error so small irn the inclination of the orbit of this planet or in the place of the nodes as to be scarcely distinguished from the unavoidable errors of observation when the satellite passes through the center of Jupiters shadow will become very considerable as It is leaving it at either pole because those errors increase nearly in the ratio of the squares of the satellites distances from the center of the shadow From the immersion and emersion of April 22d to which this note refers it appears that the inclination of the orbit of this satellite is either stated too small in the theory used by the computers of the British nautical alma nac or is subject to changes not yet inttroduced iuto these tablesMADE AT LANCASTER 119 stant jaring of the building by the shutting of the doors be lonaing to it I am Sir with

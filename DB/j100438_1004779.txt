DEAR SIR I NOW FORWARD A CONTINUATION OF MY ASTRONOMICAL OBSER VATIONS MADE AT THIS PLACE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE NU MEROUS LHAD THE WEATHER PERMITTED THE SEASON HAS BEEN RE MARKABLY UNFAVOURABLE FOR SUCLH PURSUITS THE RESULTS OF THE OBSERVATIONS ON THE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF THE 21ST OF FEBRUARY THE OCCULTATIONS THE 30TH OF MARCH 27TH OF MAY AND 23D OF SEPTEMBER LAST I HAVE NOT AS YET HAD TIME TO MAKE OUTTHE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE ADMITTING OF BUT LITTLE LEISURE FOR SCIENTIFIC ENQUIRIESBUT TO THE OBSER VATIONS FEB 21ST 1803 OBSERVATIONSON THE BEGINNING OF A SOLAR ECLIPSE THE DAY WAS CLOUDY TILL ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE BE GINNING OF THE ECLIPSE ON WHICH ACCOUNT I LHAD MADE NO PREPARATIONS TO OBSERVE ITA FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME CAL CULATED FOR THE BEGINNING I DIRECTED THE TELESCOPE TO THE SUN THE LOWER LIMB WAS VERY TREMULOUS AND INDENTED IN MANY PLACES BY A WAVING SERPENTINE MOTION WHICH WILL FREQUENTLY BE OBSERVED WHEN THE SUN IS NEAR THE HORIZONTHESE INDENTS COMBINED WITH OTHER CAUSES PRODUCED AN UNCERTAINTY OF A FEW SECONDS THOUGH PROBAABLY NOT MORE THAN 10 OR 12 IN THE BEGINNING WHICH I OBSERVED AT 5H 4 57 MEAN TIME OR 4H 50 57 APPARENT TIME R114 ASTRONOMICAL

SHOULD BE DEDUCTED FROM THE OBSERVED TIME OF THE EMERSION WHICH DEDUCTION I SHALL ACCORDINGLY USE IN MAKING OUT THE RESULT OF THE OBSERVA TION MAY 2D EMERSION OF THE 1ST SATELLITE OF JUPITER OBSERVED

DISAPPOINTED THE EX TREME VARIATIONS FROM THE MEAN RATE OF GOING FOR THE WHOLE YEAR WILL NOT AMOUNT TO 2 SECONIDS NOTWITHSTANDING THE CON THE THEORY OF THE 4TH SATELILTE OF JTUPITER IS A SUBJECT OF PECULIAR NICETY AND HAS REQUIRED GREAT LABOUR TO BRING IT TO ITS PRESENT DEGREE OF PERFECTION FOR WHICH WE ARE PRINCIPALLY INDEBTED TO THE GENIUS AND INDUSTRY OF MR DELAMBRE AN ERROR SO SMALL IRN THE INCLINATION OF THE ORBIT OF THIS PLANET OR IN THE PLACE OF THE NODES AS TO BE SCARCELY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE UNAVOIDABLE ERRORS OF OBSERVATION WHEN THE SATELLITE PASSES THROUGH THE CENTER OF JUPITERS SHADOW WILL BECOME VERY CONSIDERABLE AS IT IS LEAVING IT AT EITHER POLE BECAUSE THOSE ERRORS INCREASE NEARLY IN THE RATIO OF THE SQUARES OF THE SATELLITES DISTANCES FROM THE CENTER OF THE SHADOW FROM THE IMMERSION AND EMERSION OF APRIL 22D TO WHICH THIS NOTE REFERS IT APPEARS THAT THE INCLINATION OF THE ORBIT OF THIS SATELLITE IS EITHER STATED TOO SMALL IN THE THEORY USED BY THE COMPUTERS OF THE BRITISH NAUTICAL ALMA NAC OR IS SUBJECT TO CHANGES NOT YET INTTRODUCED IUTO THESE TABLESMADE AT LANCASTER 119 STANT JARING OF THE BUILDING BY THE SHUTTING OF THE DOORS BE LONAING TO IT I AM SIR WITH

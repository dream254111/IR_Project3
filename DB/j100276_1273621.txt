rights Why money should be treated differently from other forms of property is not apparent Pomeroy while recognizing that such an exception exists disapproves of it on principle 2 POMEROYS EQ sec 851 and note It may be safely affirmed however that some of the courts that have applied this principle do not regard it as an exception and would either decline to recognize the rule as to previous and existing rights or under the peculiar facts before them would have declined to permit a recovery had the subject matter of the litigation been other than money That money forms no exception and may be recovered in an appro priate case of mistake of law has been held in numerous cases Bingham v Bingham 1 Vesey Sr 126 Bizev Dickason 1 Term Rep 285 Lawrence v Beaubien supra where an attempt is made to

CORPORATIONACCRUING RENT A corporation lessee holding under a lease containing covenants to pay rent and giving lessor the right of reentry upon breach became insolvent The receiver quit the premises and disallowed the claim of the lessor for full rent for the remainder of the term On appeal from the disallowance Held that the claim must be rejected but without prejudice to the right of the claimant to present a new claim based upon more equitable principles Klein v Gavenesch Co 1902 N J Eq  53 Atl Rep 196 The law upon this class of cases is so closely interwoven with English and American bankruptcy and insolvency statutes that it is difficult in many cases to deduce settled principles The court in the principal case relies largely upon Stockton v Bank 1880 32 N J Eq 163 In that case the court laid down the rule that a covenant to pay rent in the future was valueless in case of insolvency and that a claim against an insolvent cor poration could not include future rent By holding that the dismissal is without prejudice to any future claim based upon equity the vice chancellor in the principal case seems to intimate that upon the presentation of such a claim the court would be ready to depart from the rule of Stockton v Bank The general rule is that an assignee is not bound to accept a lease run ning in the name of the insolvent debtor which would prove a burden to the estate and diminish the assets By refusing to accept the leasehold he can avoid all future liability upon the covenants If on the other hand the assignee deems the lease to be a profitable one he can hold it and apply its proceeds for the benefit of the estate Smith v Goodman 1893 149 Ill 75 36 N E 621 Hoyt v Stoddard 1861 2 Allen 442 Turner iv Richardson 1806 7 East 335 Dorrance v Jones 1855

Levan 1827 1 Miles Pa 358 Horwitz v Davis 1860 16 Md 313 and cases cited supra Following the decisions of the English courts in the construction of their statute American courts have deemed the lessor to be a creditor to the extent of his injury for the loss of his lease and to such extent have justly allowed him to recover prospective damages People v St Nicholas Bank 1897 151 N Y 592 45 N E 1129 Sweatmans Appeal 1892 150 Pa S 369 24 At Rep 617 Underhill v Collins 1892 132 N Y 269 30 N E 576 And this is undoubtedly the rule favored by the court in the principal case judging from its intimation LIMITATION OF ACTIONSMORTGAGESA security deed was given to secure a debt but the deed did not refer to the debt or furnish any evidence of its existence The statute of limitations had run against the debt but had not run against the equitable mortgage In an action to foreclose and to obtain a money judgment Held that the bar to the obligation secured by the deed was a bar to the action on the deed Duke v Story 1902  Ga  42 S E Rep 722 The general rule is that the mortgage security is not extinguished by reason of the fact that the debt secured by the mortgage is barred by the statute of limitations This rule has been adopted by the courts or by statutes in most of the states Several states however have adopted the contrary rule holding that an action on the mortgage is barred when an action on the debt would be This is so in Arkansas Mississippi and Missouri by express statutory provision and in California Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Ken tucky and Texas by judicial decisions Supporting the general rule see Bank of Metropolis v Guttschlik 39 U S 14 Pet 19 Borst v Corey 15 N Y 505 Norton v Palmer 142 Mass 433 contra Harrisv Mills 28 Ill 44 81 Am Dec 259 McCarthy v White 21

general rule as given above Elkins v Edwards 8 Ga 325 but in the principal case the court following Story v Davis 110 Ga 65 35 S E 314 distinguishes between a deed absolute on its face containing no reference to the debt and a mortgage which specifies the obligation secured This distinction is based on the ground that where a mortgage is given the creditor contracts that there shall be two remedies against the debtor to enforce payment while in the security deed there is no such contract expressed It would seem that any consideration that would lead the court to the conclusion that a deed absolute on its face is in fact an equitable mortgage would be of equal weight in establishing an implied contract for a double remedy MALICIOUS PROSECUTIONABUSE OF PROCESSSENDING CIAIM TO

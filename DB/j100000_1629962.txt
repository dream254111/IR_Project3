not to hurt hemp seeds but the rape seeds are destroyed by this temperature It is found that the rape seeds maintain their vitality for at least thir teen years in the soil Professor Garman in sists upon it that by the use of improved machinery the rape seeds may be largely re moved from the hemp seed The application of lime salt etc to the soil is found to have no value THE STUDY OF GALLS SOIE time ago a notice was made in these columns of a book of Edward Connold of Galls It is the intention of Professor Cook to continue this work enlarging the scope of his inquiries until he has material enough for an extended publication We may therefore confidently expect an American volume com parable to Connolds British volume referred to above CHARLES E BESSEY TJNIL ERSITY OF NEBBASKA s aRA pGles

pressurevolume on temperaturevolume and on temperatureentropy planes all of which bring out very clearly the distinctions indi cated by the tabulated data the principal being the great volume of the working cylinder for the Carnot cycle the comparatively large pressures of the Otto the Beau de Rochas and the low pressures of the Ericsson diagram The Carnot cycle is thought impracticable on account of engine volume weight and cost the Beau de Rochas involves very high tempera tures and pressures and the Ericsson and Stirling engines seem likely to waste largely by dissipation of heat cc ThSe Brayton on the whole seems to promise best and while practical obstacles modify any application it yet remains true that recent reports would seem to place en gines operating in this cycle in the lead The most novel and perhaps immediately interesting feature of the paper is its illustra tions of the cycles discussed by forms in relief The accompanying engraving is an illustra tion of one of

be the reproduction of a full grown sul phurbottom whale The mold for this was btained through the courtesy of the Cabot Steam Whaling Co at their station at Balena Newfoundland and was made from one of the largest whales taken this summer a skeleton of the same species was presented by the Colonial Manufacturing CO of St Johns Newfoundland As definite measures and weights of whales are not easily obtainable some details on these points may be of interest The animal a male from which the skeleton was procured measured V4 ft 8 in from the notch of the flukes to the tip of the nose or t9 ft from tip of flukes to tip of lower jaw I7he girth around shoulders was 35 ft and the width of the flukes 16 ft S in The skull over all measured 19 ft and the width across

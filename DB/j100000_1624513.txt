composition It seems clear that the naming of rocks may be carried to excess and that the sci ence of petrography may readily be buried under its own nomenclature H W TURNER U S GEOLOGICAL SURVEY THE DIVERSE FLORAS OF THE ROCKY MO UN TAIN REGION FEW persons living in the Eastern States are aware of the greatly diversified country which is included under the general title of the Rocky Mountain region I have often been requested by correspondents to pro cure species which being recorded from the Rocky Mountains were presumed to exist just outside my door but which as a mat ter of fact were not obtainable within a hundred miles The striking diversity which exists ac cording to altitude latitude and longitude is worthy of attention from several points of view To the horticulturist or botanist it suggests great possibilities of finding even conspicuous new species as new localities are explored To the horticulturist it also strongly suggests possibilities in the way of fruitraising since those localities which have different wild plants are likely to be suitable for different and peculiar varieties of fruits Valleys now uncultivated may in the future become famous for their special varieties of winegrapes of apples peaches or vegetables What has been done in Europe may be repeated here in time Then again to the geologist the facts are extremely significant If the pres ent flora of our region could be pkeserved in the rocks we should have a series of beds absolutely contemporaneous yet ex hibiting almost totally different sets of fos sils not merely as to species but as to genera The animal remains would be al most equally diverse the insects even more so than the plants On August 30 1889 I noted the more conspicuous plants observed in a short walk by Willow Creek Custer County Colorado at about 8200 feet altitude The list is given here and in a parallel column the nearest approximation to it obtainable in the immediate vicinity of my present home Mesilla

Pro fessor E O Wooton is working upon it so it may be that there exist a few better rep resentatives than I have cited I have however examined the flora a good deal in my searches for insects so it is not prob able that much change would be necessary It will readily be appreciated that if the Colorado species had been found as fossils and another bed in New Mexico rich in plant remains had shown no more resem blance to the first than is here shown geol ogists would have been very ready to assign different ages to the beds Local lists of plants as ordinarily pub lished do not sufficiently bring out the dif ferences between florulse In the first place collectors will often mix up two or three florulae in one list in the second in the effort to make a complete list they will include plants which are either extremely rare or actual aliens In these days of railroad travel it seems common to see near railway lines and in other places little colonies of plants out of their proper en vironment which persist a while and then perish I now propose to show that such dif ferences as above indicated do not only occur between the recognized zones but within the limits of the same zone IN Mesilla New Mexico on June 18 1897 I collected weeds in the cultivated ground of the Casad orchard I give the list and in a parallel column a list from the sandhills also in Mesilla choosing as N S

Wrightii Atriplex canescens Oryzopsis membranacea Ephedra sp The sandhill list could readily be ex tended by further study The purpose just now is merely to show that two radically different floras occur in the same immediate vicinity at the same altitude on different kinds of soil Cultivated lands here vary from the very sandy to the almost pure adobe and it may be assumed that they are thus adapted for very different crops and require different methods of cultivation It will be at once remarked from the data given in this and the preceding paper that two quite different factors have had to do with the modification of the flora In the one case the principal factor is the cli mate in the other the soil Nevertheless the twyo are intimately connected for the soil greatly modifies the effect of the cli mate Another very important factor is shade which is present in the Colorado case Moisture again is controlled partly by the general climate and partly by theMAY 6 1898 SCIENCE general nature of the soilnot merely the surface soil but the underlying beds The professional botanist will find these notes if new in themselves merely illus trative of general laws long familiar to him but they are written in the hope that others may find them interesting and may perhaps be stimulated to make similar ob servations elsewhere It is surely desirable for horticulturists to pay more attention to such matters when selecting land and choosing what to grow upon it T D A COCKERELL MESILLA PARK N M CURRENT NOTES ON PHYSIOGRAPHY THE NIAGARA GORGE WHEN the gorge of Niagara was first as cribed to work of the river it was tacitly postulated that the volume of the water and the rate of recession of the falls had been constant This postulate gave way before the suggestion that variations in river volume may have occurred during the disappearance of the ice sheet Now it is attempted to correlate these variations in volume on the one hand with the retreat ing ice front the northeastward elevation of the land and the temporary discharge of the upper great lakes across Ontario and on the other hand with the breadth and depth of the gorge A recent paper by Taylor on the Origin of the Gorge of the Whirlpool Rapids at Niagara Bull Geol Soc Amer IX 1898 5984 explains the narrow part of the gorge where it iscrossed by the railroad bridges and occupied by the Whirlpool Rapids as the work of the dis charge of Lake Erie alonethat discharge being called the ErieNiagara Riverwhile the upper lakes ran to the St Lawrence by the NipissingMattawa channel eastward from the then expanded Georgian Bay Before the ice sheet had retreated far enough to open this outlet the upper lakes dis charged through Erie and the large vol ume of Niagara at that time caused the erosion of the wider gorge and deeper gorge just below and above the Whirlpool It is thus implied that the channel of De troit River must have been laid dry while the ErieNiagara was cutting its narrow gorge and of this Taylor has found good evidence in the depth to which the valleys of small tributaries of the Detroit are eroded below the present river surface The manner in which many independent factors are thus correlated is really of dra matic interest SOUTH CAROLINA L C GLENN describes the physical fea tures of South Carolina Journ School Geogr II 1898 915 8592 giving a clear picture of the piedmont plateau and the coastal plain The piedmont is a peneplain gently rolling over most of the surface but much dissected by nar row and branching side valleys near the main streams About the headwaters many rapids and falls interrupt the streams farther down the valleys the larger rivers have opened narrow  bottoms whose fertility has been much impaired by wash from carelessly farmed hillsides The middle and outer parts of the plateau carry a number of monadnocks such as Ruffs Parsons Kings and other low mountains On the inner part of the plateau the resid ual mountains are higher and more numer ous rising 1000 to 1500 feet above the peneplain The coastal plain is hilly along its inner border low and smooth over most of its extent Here the chief rivers have broad swampy flood plains The numerous channels that divide the islands along the coast are ascribed to the strong tides of the Carolina bight It may be noted in this connection that the Journal of Geography edited by Professor R E Dodge of Teachers College New York has published a number of firsthand 627

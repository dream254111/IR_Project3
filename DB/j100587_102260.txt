DI STINGUISH IT FROM ANY OTHER THAT MAY BE MET WITH THERE THE WHOLE SHAPE OF THIS ANIMAL IS SUCH THAT WE MAY EASILY REDUCE IT TO THE SWINE KIND AS PLAINLY APPEARS BY OUR FIGURE WHICH IS MUCH MORE EXACT THAN EITHER THAT IN HERNANDEZ WHERE THE SNOUT AND HEAD SEEMS TOO SLENDER NOR DID WE OBSERVE THAT WHITE RING ABOUT THE NECK WHICH IS THERE CONJECTURALLY DESCRIBED OR THAT IN PISO JOHNSTON C WHERE IT IS PICTURED WITH LARGE MUSTACHIOS AND A TAYLE BUT IT WAS MUCH LESSER THEN OUR USUAL HOGGS FOR FROM THE END OF THE BODY WHERE THE TA LE SHOULD BE TO THE TOP OF THE HEAD BETWEEN THE EARS WAS TWO FOOT

THE LOWER JAW IN THIS MEXICOHOG WAS MORE PROTUBERANT AND THE HEAD LESS TAPERING THEN IN OUR SMINE AND IN THE SCELETON APPEARS MUCH LIKE THAT OF THE BABY ROUSSA ONLY IT HAD NOT THOSE TEETH AND THE NECK APPEARED SO VERY SHORT AND THICK NOT FROM THOSE LARGE GLANDS WHICH IN SOME OF THE SWINE KIND DO SO STUFF OUT THEIR NECKS BUT FROM THE SHORT TURN ING UPWARDS OF THE VERTEBRAE OF THE NECK WHICH WERE KEPT361 KEPT SO CLOSE TO THE BODY BY THE INSERTION OF THAT STRONG LIGAMENT INTO THE POLE FROM THE BACK WHICH IN ANIMALS THAT ARE PRONO CAPITE IS OF EXTRAORDINARY USE AND MUCH ADDS TO THE STRENGTH OF THIS ANIMAL THE COLOUR OF THE BODY WAS GRISLY BEING BESET WITH BRISTLES WHICH WERE THICKER THEN THOSE OF A HOG AND LESSER THAN THOSE OF A HEDGHOG BUT LIKE THOSE OF A HEDGHOG OR THE QUILLS OF A

FROM THE SAME IN COMMON HOGS OR THE MOST COMMON ANIMALS HAVING THEREFORE DIVIDED THE MUSCLES OF THE BELLY WHAT FIRST OF ALL WE TOOK NOTICE OF WAS THE REMARK ABLE STRUCTURES OF THE STOMACKS FOR IT HAD THREE INTO THE MIDDLEMOST WAS INSERTED THE OESOPHAGUS OR GULLET WHICH WE THEREFORE SHALL CALL THE FIRST VENTRICLE OR STOMACK FROM THIS ON ONE SIDE WAS A LARGE PASSAGE INTO THE SECOND WHICH POUCHING

APPREHENDING THE SHAPE AND EXTERNAL M VID JOH FABIN  MEX P648 FORM365 FORM OF THESE SEVERAL STOMACKS I HAVE CAUSED THEM TO BE REPRESENTED IN THREE DIFFERENT POSTURES IN THREE SCHEMES WHICH FULLY

THE INSERTION OF THE OESOPHAGUS INTO THE FIRSTIN THE 1ST FIG TAB 2 ALL THREE STOMAKS OPENED WHEREIN IS REMARKABLE THAT THE FIRST STOMACK WAS LINED WITHIN WITH A WHITE THICK HARD MEMBRANE ALMOST LIKE THE INWARD PELLICLE OF THE GIZARD OF FOWLS WITH WHICH NONE OF THE OTHER STOMACKS WERE ENDOWED FOR THE INWARD SURFACE OF THE SECOND WAS SMOOTH AND SOFT ITS MEMBRANES THIN AND MORE IN CLINING TO THE COMMON MAKE OF THAT OF CARNIVOROUS ANI MALS THE THIRD SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS BUT THICKER AND RIMPLED WITHIN WITH LARGE PLICAE OR FOLDS OUR COMMON HOG SEEMES TO HAVE BUT ONE STOMACK AND MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THESE OF OUR TAJACU WHERE NATURE MAKES MORE TIS NO DOUBT FOR NECESSARY USES WHAT HERE BY THE WHITE PELLICLE OF THE FIRST STOMACK IS PLAINLY DISTIN GUISHED INTO THREE IS MORE OBSCURELY SO IN OUR COMMON HOGGS N DR GREW DOES GIVE THEM BUT TWO ACKNOW LEDGING IT TO BE SHAPED SOMEWHAT ODDLY IN A MANNER WITH A DOUBLE VENTRICLE THE ONE AND THE PRINCIPAL MAY BE CALLED VENTER MAGNUS SHAPED LIKE THAT OF CARNIVOROUS QUADRUPEDS VERY THICK AND MUSCULAR ESPECIALLY ON THE NECK AND AT THE PYLORUS AT THE LEFT END OF THIS GREATER VENTRICLE ANOTHER FAR LEFS YET A DISTINCT ONE IS APPENDENT MUCH AFTER THE SAME MANNER AS THE RETI CULUM IN A SHEEP IS TO THE PAUNCH OR AS THE INTESTINUM CAECUM TO THE OTHER GUTS FOR WHICH REASON IT MAY BE CALLED CAECUS VENTRICULUS SEPARATED FROM THE GREATER BY A MUSCNLAR

PLAIN AS WAS OUR FIRST BUT WHAT HE TAKES NOTICE OF THAT IN THE COMMON HOG AGAINST THE PYLORUS STANDS A ROUND CARUNCLE AS BIG AS A SMALL FILBERD KERNEL LIKE A STOPLE TO THE PYLORUS A PART HE THINKS PECULIAR TO THIS ANIMAL THIS IN OUR MEXICO HOG I DID NOT OBSERVE HIS O CONJECTURE OF THE USE OF IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH IT BEING SO VORACIOUS AN ANIMAL FOR THE PREVENTING A TOO SUDDEN AND COPIOUS IRRUPTION OF THE ALIMENT WHICH IS SUFFICIENTLY PROVIDED FOR IN OUR SUB JECT BY THE GREAT STREIGHTNING OF THE PYLORUS HERE AND THE GREAT ASCENT IT MUST MAKE BEFORE IT CAN GO OUT WHICH MAY BE THE REASON TOO OF NATURES MAKING THESE SE VERAL CELLS OR PARTITIONS FOR THE BETTER DIGESTION AND MACERATION OF THE FOOD FOR IT BEING FRUGIVOROUS GRAMINI VOROUS AND CARNIVOROUS TOO THE STOMACKS ARE SO CONTRIV ED AS THAT THE FIRST HEREBY ITS INWARD PELLICLE SOMEWHAT RE SEMBLES THAT OF BIRDS THAT ARE CARPOPHAGOUS SO THE OTHERS THOSE OF QUADRUPEDS WHY A HOG OF ANY ANIMAL SHOULD BE SAID THE MOST TO RESEMBLE MAN IN ALL ITS INWARD PARTS WITHOUT A META PHOR I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT MAY BE A PASSAGE IN THAT BOOK ASCRIBED TO GALLEN DE ANATOME PARVA MAY GIVE SOME OCCASION TO THIS VULGAR ERROUR NONE WHO SHALL COMPARE

STRUCTURE LIES LOOSE AND FALLS DOWN FOR THE DUODENUM ARISING FROM THE PYLO RUS WITH A SHORT TURN THAT AND THE OTHER SMALL INTESTINES MADE ABUNDANCE OF CONVOLUTIONS AND WINDINGS AND ALTHO THE MESENTERY WAS BUT VERY SHORT FROM THE SPINE AND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SEEMINGLY BUT VERY LITTLE YET IN THIS COMPASS IT CONTEINED 27 FOOT OF THESE INTESTINES FOR SO MUCH THEY MEASURED FROM THE PYLORUS TO THE COLON THE COLON WAS NOT FASTENED TO THE PERIPHERY OR RIM OF THE MESENTERY AS ORDINARILY BUT ARISING FROM THE CEN TER OR MIDDLE MADE A SPIRAL LINE ITS END HANGING LOOSE AND ITS TURNINGS CLOSELY UNITED ONE TO ANOTHER BY MEM BRANES THIS COLON WAS VERY LARGE IN RESPECT OF THE O THER GUTS AND AS I MEASURD IT WAS 9 FOOT LONG IT HAD A SHORT CAECUM BUT PRETTY WIDE AND FILLED WITH FAE CES WHAT DR GREW OBSERVES THAT TIS PECULIAR TO THE CAECUM OF A HOG AND THAT OF A HORSE TO HAVE THE SAME STRUCTURE WITH THE COLON IS TRUE HERE TOO AND IT MAY BE P APUD JO FABER IN HIST MEXICAN C C C RECK368 RECKONED AS AN APPENDIX OF THE COLON IN A HOG DR GREM MAKES SEVEN INTESTINES THE SAME DIFFERENCES IT MAY BE I MIGHT HAVE MET WITH HERE BUT I WAS PREVENTED BY THE LITTLE LEASURE I HAD OF BEING SO NICE IN THIS AS SOME OTHER PARTS AND IT BEING KEPT SO LONG BEFORE I HAD IT FOR DIS SECTION IT WAS RENDRED LESS FIT FOR SUCH ENQUIRIES FAL COBURGIUS SAITH THE LENGTH OF ALL THE GUTS WERE 34 GEOME TRICAL FEET OURS MEASURED MORE THE STRUCTURE OF THE COLON HERE I LOOK ON AS EXTRAORDINARY SOME SUCH GUT I FIND IN A GOAT MAKING SEVERAL SPIRAL WINDINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MESENTERY BUT THEN TAKING A COMPASS ROUND NEAR THE VERGE TO WHICH ARE FASTENED THE LESSER INTESTINES AT LAST PASSES INTO THE RECTUM SO IN A WOOD COCK THERE IS SUCH A SPIRAL GUT BUT IN OUR TAJACU NOT ONLY THE STOMACK GUT AND MESSENTERY WERE EXTRAOR DINARY BUT THE MESARAICK VESSELS TOO FOR IN MEN AND DOGS C MAKING THE SEGMENT OF A CIRCLE NEAR THE MIDDLE THEY THEN SEND OUT SEVERAL LARGE BRANCHES TO WARDS THE INTESTINES WHICH AS THEY APPROACH THEM BY THEIR MUTUAL INOSCULATION FOR IN SEVERAL SMALL ARCHES FROM WHENCE ISSUE NUMEROUS LESSER BRANCHES TO THE GUTS THEMSELVES BUT HERE IN OUR HOG WE OBSERVED A LARGE VEIN AND ARTERY RUNNING A SMALL AND EQUAL DISTANCE FROM THE INTESTINES AND FROM THEM ARISING AN INFINITE NUMBER OF LESSER BUT STRAIGHT VESSELS WHICH GOING TO THE GUTS SO REGULARLY AND IN SO GREAT NUMBERS AFFORD ED A VERY PLESANT SIGHT

AT THE UP PER END THEN THE LOWER AND IN THE MIDDLE ABOUT AN INCH BROAD THEY WERE PLACED IN THE SCROTUM THEIR COLOUR WHITE THEIR STRUCTURE CLOSE SO THAT THE VESSELS WHICH COMPOSED THEM DID NOT SO PLAINLY APPEAR AS IN AN ORDINARY BOAR NOTWITHSTANDING WHICH NO DOUBT THEIR WHOLE COMPAGES WAS VASCULAR THO HERE CLOSER WROUGHT TOGETHER AND UNITED Q VAUCLIUS DATHIRIUS BONGLARUS DISCOVERD THIS VASCULAR STRUCTURE OF THE TESTIS OF A BOAR AS ALSO OF A MAN ABOUT TEN YEARS BEFORE REG DE GRAEF PUBLISHED HIS BOOK DE ORGANIS VIRORUM GENERAT INSERVIENTIB AND HAS GIVEN GOOD FIGURES OF THE SAME THO THE LATTER HAS GIVEN A MUCH LARGER AND FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THIS SUBJECT SINCE THEIR USE IS NO DOUBT TO PREPARE THE SEMEN WHICH IS CONVEYED THENCE BY THE VA SA DEFERENTIA TO THE VESICULAE SEMINALES THESE DEFERENTIA ARISE NEAR THE LOWER PART OF THE TESTES AND ARE SO IN SERTED THAT THEY MIGHT ALMOST EQUALLY EMPTY THEMSELVES EITHER INTO THE VESICAE SEMINALES OR VRETHRA I DO NOT RE MEMBER WHAT OR WHITHER THERE WERE ANY EPIDIDYMIS ON THE TESTES THE VESICULAE SEMINALES WERE 1 2 INCH LONG IN SOME PLACES 14 IN OTHERS HALF AN INCH BROAD THO CALLED VESICULAE YET HERE THEY APPEARED MORE GLANDULOUS NOR WAS THEIR CAVITY ANY THING CONSIDERABLY LARGE THE COMMON ORIFICES TO THEM AND THE VASA DEFERENTIA MADE A RISING IN THE INSIDE OF THE VRETHRA WHICH DE GRAEF CALLS VID PHILOSOPH TRANSACT NUMB 42 P

VESICULAE HERE BEING SO GLANDULOUS POSSIBLY THEY MAY PERFORM THEIR OFFICE UNLESS WE SHOULD ASCRIBE THEIR USE TO THOSE TWO GLANDS WHICH LAY ON EACH SIDE THE VRETHRA AND EMPTIED THEMSELVES WITH TWO O RIFICES NEAR THE ROOT OF THE PENIS THESE GLANDS WERE CYLINDRICAL OF A WHITISH YELLOW COLOUR AN INCH AND HALF LONG AND 38 OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER THEIR SUB STANCE CLOSE LIKE THAT OF THE TESTES AND NO PERCEPTIBLE CAVITY WITHIN AND THEY LAY ALONG THE OUTSIDE THE VRE THRA REACHING FROM THE MUSCULI ERECTORES PENIS TO THE GLANDULOUS VESICULAE BEFORE DESCRIBED TO VAN HORN WOULD HAVE A THREEFOLD MATTER OF THE SEED ONE FROM THE TESTES THE SECOND FROM THE VESICU LAE SEMINALES AND A THIRD FROM THE PROSTATES BUT THIS DE GRAAFR STRONGLY APPOSES AND WILL ADMIT ONLY THAT FROM THE TESTES WHICH IS TRANSMITTED TO THE VESICULAE SE MINALES AND NOT AT ALL BRED THERE BUT IN OUR SUBJECT AND SO IN SOME OTHERS THEY BEING GLANDULOUS THEY MUST THEREFORE SECRETE SOME JUICE WHICH IN ALL LIKELYHOOD IS SOME WAYS SERVICEABLE THO NOT PRINCIPALLY IN GE NERATION AND INDEED IN THE HOGKIND I FIND THESE PARTS VERY REMARKABLE IN A BOAR THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF VESICULAE SEMINALES ONE VESICULOUS THE OTHER GLANDULOUS IN A HEDGEHOG THERE ARE THREE PAIR OF VESICULAE SEMINALES TWO IN THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN AND A THIRD BETWEEN THE MUSCLES OF THE BELLY AND THE SKIN IN A FEMALE HEDGEHOG TOO I FIND IN THE SIDE OF THE VAGINA BELOW THE ORIFICE OF THE URETHRA A GLANDULOUS BODY PLACED WHICH HAS A CONSIDERABLE CAVITY FOR ITS BIGNESS AND A PLAIN ORIFICE BY WHICH IT EMPTIES IT SELF INTO THE URE THRA BUT OF THIS MORE WHEN I GIVE THE ANATOMY OF THAT ANIMAL AND AT PRESENT SHALL NOT FURTHER REASON R REG DE GRAAF CE ORGAN VIROR GENERAT INSERVIENT ON371 ON THESE PARTS BUT ONLY OBSERVE THAT THE PENIS IN OUR TAJACU WAS A LONG SLENDER BODY MADE NP OF SEVERAL MUSCLES WHEREOF TWO WERE VERY LONG THE VESICA URINARIA OR BLADDER OF URINE WAS ROUNDER THEN IN SOME OTHER ANIMALS WHERE USUALLY TIS MORE OB LONG THE URETERS WERE INSERTED AT THE NECK OF THE BLADDER NOT SIDES AS IN SOME HOW THE KIDNEYS WERE I DO NOT NOW PARTICULARLY REMEMBER BUT BELEIVE THERE WAS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY MEETING WITH NOTHING OF THEM IN MY NOTES I SHALL THEREFORE HASTEN TO THE THO RAX WHERE WE DID NOT MEET MUCH OBSERVABLE UNLESS IT WAS THE DESCENDENT TRUNCK OF THE ARTERIA AORTA WHICH I SHALL DESCRIBE HAVING FIRST PREMISED WHAT

VERO CIRCA CORDIS MUCRONEM POSITUS TANQUAM UTRIQUE COMMUNIS BUT WHAT OF ALL SURPRISED US MOST AND MADE US SOON NEGLECT THE OTHER PARTS WHICH WE SAW HAD NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS COMMON WAS THE STRANGE FORMATION OF THE AORTA WHICH AS IT DESCENDED ALONG THE SPINE IN ALL OTHER ANIMALS I HAVE OBSERVED ITS TRUNCK ALMOST OF AN EQUAL BIGNESS ONLY A LITTLE TAPERING DOWNWARDS BUT HERE BETWEEN THE HEART AND ITS BRANCHINGS INTO THE ILIAC ARTERIES WE FOUND THREE LARGE SWELLINGS OUT THE LARGEST WAS THAT NEAREST THE HEART WHICH AFTER A SMALL STRAIGHTNING AGAIN EMPTIED IT SELF INTO THE SECOND WHICH THO SOMETHING LESS THEN THE FIRST YET MUCH LAR GER THAN THE THIRD WHICH WAS NEAR THE DIVISION OF THE AORTA INTO THE RAMI ILIACI TWO OF THESE SWELLINGS I OPENED AND FOUND WITHIN SEVERAL UNEQUAL CELLS OR HOLLOWS BUT WITHAL COULD NOT PERCEIVE BUT THE MEM BRANES HERE WERE ALTOGETHER AS THICK AS WHERE THE AR TERY WAS NOTHING EXTENDED    LOCO ANTE CITATO THESE372 THESE EXTENSIONS OF AN ARTERY BY GALEN AND ALL OTHERS ARE CALLED ANEURISMATA AS THOSE OF A VEIN VARICES AND ARE REPUTED TO HAPPEN WHEN THE INWARD COAT OF THE ARTERY IS BURSTEN AND SO GIVES WAY FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE OUTWARD AND COMMONLY THEY HAVE BEEN OCCASIONED BY PRICKING AN ARTERYWHEN THEY HAVE DESIGNED A VEIN BUT WHAT SHOULD BE THE CAUSE OF ITIN OUR SUBJECTIS MOST DIFFICULT TO ASSIGNE FOR IT BEING THE ONLY ONE OF THE KIND I HAVE DIFFECTED I KNOW NOT HOW FAR IT MAY BE PRAETERNATURAL OR WHITHER IN OTHERS THE SAME BE TO BE MET WITH AGAIN IF PRAETERNATURAL TIS THE MORE REMARKABLE IT SHOULD HAPPENHERE BECAUSE THIS IS THE STRONGEST AND THICKESTARTERY IN THE WHOLE BODY IF NATURAL THERE IS NOTHING I CAN AT PRESENT BETTER PARALEL IT WITHTHEN THOSE PROTUBERANT SWELLINGS IN THE AORTA OF SILKWORMES AND OTHER SUCH INSECTS WHICH MALPIGHI TAKES FORSO MANY SEVERAL HEARTS WHICH MUST BE ALLOWED HIM UNLESS WE WILL DENY THEM TO HAVE ANY HEART AT ALL WHICH POSSIBLY IT MAY FOR IN A LEECH THERE ARE TWO LARGE ARTERIES WITHOUT ANY OF THESE SWELLINGS SO WE MUST EITHER CONFESS THEM TO BE TWO HEARTS OR NOT TO HAVE ANY FOR THERE IS NO PART YET I HAVE OBSERVED IN THEM THAT I CAN GIVE THAT NAME TO BE SIDES NOR TO THESE TOO WITHOUT SOME ALLOWANCE AS TO THE OTHER PARTS WE HAVE BUT LITTLE TO SAY FOR WANT OF TIME WE HAD NOT LEASURE TO EXAMINE THE BRAIN THE APERTURE OF THE EYE WAS BUT SMALL AS IN THE HOG KIND THE MEMBRANA MICTITANS PLAINER THEN USUALLY IN QUADRUPEDS WHICH MIGHT BE CONVENIENT SINCE WALLOW ING IN MUD THEY MIGHT THE BETTER RUB OFF ANY FILTH THAT MIGHT HAPPEN THERE THE MUSCLES NOT SO DISTINCT AS IN SOME BRUTES AND HENCE THE MOTION OF THEIR EYES NOT SO QUICK NOR REGULAR THE PUPIL ROUND THE OPTICK NERVE INSERTED ALMOST IN THE AXIS OF THE EYE AND ON THE INSIDE MADE A SMALL DINT THE CHOROIDES OF A PALE VIOLET AND BROWNISH COLOUR BUT WE SHALL NOW COME TO WHAT SEEMS MOST PECULIAR TO THIS ANIMAL AND AS I KNOW OF TO BE MET WITH IN NONE BESIDES AND IS MENTIONED BY ALL NOT WITHOUT GREAT AD MIRATION WHO HAVE WROTE OF THIS STRANGE HOG VIZ THE GLAN373 GLANDULOUS BODY ON THE BACK HAD I NOT HAD THE FIRST NOTICE OF IT FROM THEM TIS A THING SO UNCOMMON THAT IN ALL LIKELYHOOD IT HAD PASSED INOBSERVED BY ME AS IT MIGHT HAVE DONE TOO HAD ONLY A SINGLE AUTHOR ASSERTED THE UMBILICUS OR NAVEL TO BE PLACED THERE BUT FINDING SO UNIVERSAL A CONSENT I THOUGHT THAT THO THEY MIGHT BE MISTAKEN IN THEIR CONJECTURES ABOUT THE USES YET THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT MUST OFFER THE OCCASION HAVING THEREFORE AT LAST FOUND IT OUT AND WELL OBSERVED IT I SHALL HERE GIVE THE DESCRIPTION OF IT AS I VIEWED IT THEN DELIVER THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS WHAT THEY CONJECTURED IT MIGHT BE AND LASTLY OFFER MY OWN THOUGHTS CONCER NING IT WHICH HAVING DONE AND TAKING A SHORT SURVEY OF THE SCELETON WE SHALL CONCLUDE IN MY DESCRIPTION OF THIS PART I SHALL HAVE FREQUENT RE COURSE TO THE FIGURES I HAVE CAUSED TO BE MADE OF IT WHICH BEING SO ACCURATEAND TO THE LIFE WILL EASILY DISCO VER TO THE PHANTASIE WHAT IT IS BETTER THEN IT CAN BE DRAWN OR DESCRIBED BY WORDS IN FIGURE 1 BY THE LETTER A YOU HAVE THE PLACE POINTED TO WHERE TWAS SEATED ON THE BACK VIZ JUST ON THE RIDGE OF IT OVER THE HINDER LEGS BUT SO COVERED BY THE LONG BRISTLES THERE THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE OBSERVED BUT BY OPENING OF THEM WITH THE HAND AND AND THEN YOU SHALL FIND A SMALL SPACE THERE ALMOST BARE ONLY BESET WITH FEWER SHORTER AND FINER HAIRS AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT THE PROTUBERANT ORISICE OF THE GLAND BY WHICH IT DISCHARGES IT SELF OF THE LIQUOR WHICH IS SEPA RATED BY IT WITHIN THIS ORIFICE OR FORAMEN WHICH IS EX ACTLY REPRESENTED IN ITS NATURAL BIGNESS AND

QUICKLY DISCHARGE IT WHOLLY OUT OF THE BODY AS IN SOME OR TRANSMIT THE SEPARATED JUICE INTO BAGS OR BLAD DERS WHERE IT REMAINS SOME LONGER TIME AS IN MANY O THER ANIMALS THIS I FIRST TOOK A NOTICE OF

THEM AND THEN THE WHOLE BODY SEEMED VE RY INOFFENSIVE THE SAME I HAVE OBSERVED IN ABUNDANCE OF OTHER ANIMALS AS IN ALL THE POLECATKIND IN OUR COMMON CATS IN A LYON IN DOGS IN A FOX C THOSE BAGS IN THE CIVETCAT OR HYAENA ODORIFERA ARE NOTHING BUT THE SAME AS ARE LIKEWISE THOSE OF A MUSKQUASH MEN TIONED BY JOSSELIN IN HIS HISTORY OF THE RARITIES OF NEM ENGLAND FOR THEY ARE NOT THE TESTICLES OF THAT ANIMAL AS THAT LETTER FROM DUBLIN IN THE PHILOSOPHICTRANSACTIONS NO127 PAG 653 DOES INTIMATE FOR HAVING SEEN THE SKINS HERE IN TOWN AND THOSE MUSK CODS I FIND THEM TO BE ONLY THE SCENTBAGS SO THE CASTOREUM WE HAVE IN OUR SHOPS IS NOT THE STONES OF A BEAVER AS FORMERLY RE PUTED BUT OF THE SAME NATURE ALTOGETHER WITH OUR SCENT BAGS I SHOULD BE TOO PROLIX SHOULD I INLARGE UPON THIS SUB JECT HERE IT SHALL SUFFICE TO SAY THAT IN MOST SPECIES OF ANIMALS THERE MAY BE OBSERVED SOMETHING THE SAME OR A VID DR PLOTS NAT HISTORY OF OXON SHIRE CAP9 P 305 D D D 2 OR378 OR ANALOGOUS TO IT WHICH GIVE THEM

GLANDS WHICH HAVE THEIR PIPES OR SECRETORY DUCTUS ARISING ON THE TOP OF IT ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN WHICH DISCHARGES A FAETID LIQUOR I FIND THESE GLANDS THE LARGEST IN GEESE AND THE DUCK KIND WHICH USE THE WATER AND A NY ONE AT THE TABLE BY TASTING MAY PERCEIVE IN A DUCK HOW STRONG SCENTED THEY BE IN TURKYS TIS LESS GLANDU LOUS BUT THEY HAVE A LARGER CYSTIS WITHIN IN THE OS TRIDGE INDEED I DID NOT OBSERVE IT ON THE RUMP BUT SOMETHING HIGHER ON THE BACK WHERE IT MADE TWO BUN CHINGS OUT AND UNDER THE SKIN I FOUND A CYSTIS FILLD WITH A CONCRETED YELLOWISH JUICE THIS SOMETHING APPROACHED NEAR THE PLACE WHERE WAS SEATED THE LAND IN OUR MEXICO HOG WHICH I CALL THE SCENTGLAND AND IT YIELDING SO GRATEFUL A PERFUME FOR SO IT WAS ESTEEMED BY MY SELF AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHO SMELT IT FROM IT I HAVE NAMED IT THE MEXICO MUSK HOG THIS DIFFERENCE IS REMARKABLE WHEREAS OUR MUSK HOG HAS ITS SCENT GLAND SEATED ON THE BACK AND IT HAS BEEN BY MOST HITHERTO MISTAKEN FOR A NAVEL SO THE GAZELLA OR MUSK DEER HAS HIS MUSKBAG ON THE BELLY NEAR THE UMBILI CUS THIS BEING SO LARGELY DESCRIBED BY LUCAS SCHROEKIUS IN HIS HISTORIA MOSCHI NOT LONG SINCE PUBLISHED I SHALL RE FER TO HIM FOR A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF IT BUT IT MAY BE EXPECTED PERHAPS I SHOULD GIVE SOME FAR THER REASONS FOR THE NAME I HAVE BESTOWED ON OUR HOG AND THE RATHER TOO SINCE NO AUTHOR HAS CALLD IT A PERFUME BUT BRANDED IT AS THE GREATEST STINK AS IS ALREADY OB  VID PHILOSOPH TRANSACT NO 144 P 38 SERVED379 SERVED BY THAT GREAT CAUTION THEY GIVE OF CUTTING IT OUT LEAST IT SPOILS ALL THE OTHER FLESH JO FABER LABOURS MUCH TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT HOW THIS HORRID FAETOR SHOULD HAPPEN AND HAVING FALLEN INTO ONE ERROUR IN SUPPOSING IT A NA VEL THAT LEADS AND PRAECIPITATES HIM INTO OTHERS AND MAKES HIM FANCY SOMETIMES IT MAY BE FROM THE

HE CALLS IT THUS HE OBSERVES WHAT AN HORRID STINK THE URINE OF CATS WILL MAKE WHERE IT LIGHTS BUT HERE I MUST REMARK THAT IN RENDRING THEIR URINE AT THE SAME TIME THEY MAY EMPTY THEIR SCENT BAGS SEATED AT THE RECTUM WHICH MIXING WITH IT IN A GREAT MEASURE MAY GIVE IT ITS STRONG FAETOR SO THE SAME OF RATS AND MICE OF A FOX WHEN HUNTED C AND I AM APT TO THINK TWAS BY REMOVING THESE SCENTBAGS RA

SMELL IN OUR TA JACU COME NOT FROM ANY OTHER PARTS BUT IS NATURALLY SE PARATED HERE AS IS THE MUSK THE CIVET THE CASTOR THE SMELL OF A FOX OF THE POLECAT C IN THEIR PROPER SCENT GLANDS AND SCENTBAGS NOR AM I ANY THING CONCERNED THAT OTHERS SAY IT STINKS WHEN I WOULD MAKE IT A PERFUME OR DO I QUESTION BUT THAT THEIR SENSE AND NOSES WERE AS GOOD AS MINE SINCE I KNOW THAT THE BEST PERFUMES SOMETIMES MAKE THE GREATEST STINKS CIVET NAY MUSK IT SELF WHEN FRESH AND GREEN AND IN LARGE QUANTITIES ARE NO WAYS AGREEABLE BUT VERY OFFENSIVE TO THE SMELL AS MANY HAVE OBSERVED AND WHAT IS MORE TOO SUCH IS

SCENT SO FOXES TILL THEY ARE WELL GROWN DO NOT MUCH STINK BUT AFTERWARDS WHEN IN GREAT PLENTY THIS JUICE IS VOYDED BY ITS COPIOSNESS AND BEING THIN AND FLUID AND SO MORE VAPOURABLE IT MIGHT STRIKE OUR ORGANS WITH SUCH BRISK AND NIMBLE STROKES AS TO CREATE A PAIN WHEREAS A MORE LEASURELY APPULSE OF ITS PARTICLES FROM A LESSER AND CONCRETED BODY MAY GIVE A PLEASURE AS THE FEIRCE RAYES OF A SCORCHING FIRE DOES EXCITE A DOLOROUS SENSE WHENAS IT IS DELIGHTED AND REFRESHED BY THE GENT LER BEAMS OF A MODERATE SUN OUR TAJACU THEREFORE NO DOUBT WHEN THIS GLAND DOES VERY LIBERALLY DISCHARGE ITS LIQUOR MAY BE THOUGHT TO STINK AND YET THIS STINK IN TIME MAY BECOME A PERFUME THUS THAT FAETID LIQUOR IN THE SCENTBAGS OF A WEASEL HAVING FORMERLY PUT IT ON A PAPER AND KEPT IT A LITTLE WHILE AFFORDED ME A PLEASANT SMELL WHY THEREFORE WE PERCEIVED NO STINK AT FIRST UPON THE DIFFECTION OF THIS GLAND BUT RATHER A SWEET AND PLEASANT SMELL IF IT IS O THERWISE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY BREED THIS MAY BE THE REASON BE CAUSE IT HAD BEEN DEAD SOME DAYS BEFORE I EXAMINED THIS PART AND THEN I FOUND BUT A SMALL QUAN TITY OF AN INCRASSATED LIQUOR THERE THO I MUST ACKNOW LEDGE THAT I WAS INFORMED THAT WHEN IT WAS ALIVE IT WAS OBSERVED BY THE FAMILY WHERE TWAS KEPT THAT WHERE EVER IT WENT IT LEFT A GOOD PERFUME BEHIND IT THIS I AM SURE OF THAT WHEN TWAS DEAD AND OBSERVED BY ME AND SEVERAL OTHERS IT YIELDED A FRAGRANT ONE WHICH I THINK IS SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFIE OR AT LEAST TO EXCUSE THE NAME I HAVE GIVEN IT AND NOW TO GIVE A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE SCELETON AND SO TO END WE OBSERVED THAT THE CRANIUM SEEMED ENTIRE WITHOUT SUTURES FROM THE NOSE TO THE END OF THE POLE 8  INCHES HERE THE CRANIUM GREW VERY NARROW AND THEN DID SPREAD IT SELF AGAIN TRIANGULARWISE AND BEHIND MADE A LARGE HOLLOW WHERE IT RESPECTED THE BACK AND WHERE381 WHERE WERE INSERTED STRONG MUSCLES AND THE LIGAMENT FROM THE BACK I FORMERLY MENTIONED BY WHICH MEANS THE HEAD IS KEPT SO STRAIGHT UP THAT WHEN ALIVE HE SEEM ED TO HAVE

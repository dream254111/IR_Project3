j100010,The American Historical Review,1833721,Virginia and the Quebec Bill,i304858,VIRGINIA AND THE QUEBEC BILL IN I774 there came for the first time a sharp conflict between Virginia and the home government as to jurisdiction over the territory north of the Ohio The interpretation which Virginia had always given to the somewhat obscure definition of her bounds in the charter of I609 had been long denied by France and when that contested region was wrested from France the peace of 1763 had limited its western extension by the Mississippi The royal proclamation which soon followed had prevented the pushing of settlements thither but had not given it over absolutely to other jurisdiction Ten years or more later while Virginia was waging war against the savages thereabouts to enforce her claim and pro tect her settled frontiers the British Parliament strove to put a limit to her territorial preteinsions in this direction by giving the Quebec government an absolute jurisdiction over the region There were other purposes both ostensible and latent in this legislative movement which were entered upon to curb not only Virginia but the other seaboard colonies in an inevitable westward march Ever since Carleton had been in command in Quebec he had felt the necessity of yielding something more to the French Canadians than had been allowed by the capitulation at Montreal in I760 and by the acts of I763 He contended that a further concession could alone make them good British subjects and that a guarded revival of French law customs and religion while pla cating I50000 Catholics of the province as Carleton counted them though his estimate is probably much too large  would not seriously impair the fortunes of four hundred Protestants their fellowsubjects In I770 Carleton had gone to England leaving in his place Cramahe a Swiss Protestant in the English service During the four years of his absence Carleton was in occasional consultation with the ministry about what seemed to him some needed transformation of the government of the province This consideration was at times affected and perhaps shaped by peti tions of the Canadians not largely signed and forwarded by Cramahe They touched the restoration of French laws and a rehabilitation of the Catholic religion 436Virginia and the Quebec Bill 437 While such questions were in abeyance the revolutionary com motions in Boston did not fail to render of doubtful continuance the loyalty of the seaboard colonies If such disaffection could not be stamped out it became a question of restraining it by terri torial bounds and covertly if not openly This danger had already delayed the entire fulfilment of the Vandalia project south of the Ohio It was known that there was a tide of immigration rolling along the Ohio and in spite of the agreement at Fort Stanwix threatening its northern banks It was necessary then to find some barrier to check the current lest it should buoy up the seething commotions of the seaboard No such barrier was so obvious as that which the French had attempted to maintain in the recent warthe line of the St Lawrence and the Alle ghanies To make this barrier effective it was necessary to con solidate as far as possible the region behind it in a single govern ment Murray and his successor Carleton had already urged an extension of their executive authority from Quebec westward and the opportune time had come for doing it under an ostensible plea of regulating the fur trade of the region If the traders were gratified by such professions the debates and remonstrances show that the proposed reinstatement of the Roman Church and the suppression of English law drew out fervent opposition and there is moreover no evidence that the Canadians themselves as a population felt any elation over the prospect This may have been due in some part to a latent sympathy among them with the revolutionary classes of the older colonies  a sympathy with which Congress as it turned out blundered in an attempt to deal A new petition from Canada dated February I774 and signed by only sixtyfive persons asked for a restoration of the old bounds of Canada over which the English and French had so long disputed and the ministry in granting it were ensnared into the somewhat ridiculous acknowledgment of what they had for merly denied To restore such limits however would please the Canadians and some furtraders and became a good cloak for ulterior purposes respecting the seaboard colonies Immediate opposition naturally came from the Penns whose proprietary rights would be curtailed and from Virginia whose royal governor interested with many of her people in land schemes in the Illinois country was already preparing for an invasion of the territory The movement for a colony north of the Ohio over which Franklin and Hillsborough had contended had come to naught much to the relief of Virginia but here was a project seeking the active sanction of Parliament and likely to thwart438 J Winsor any purpose which her royal governor might have of issuing patents to this very land Dunmore was a man not easily balked He had already taken possession of Fort Pitt despite the protests of Penn and was determined to hold it as a gate to the overriver country of Virginia This precipitate conduct had alarmed Haldimand the military head of the Continent lest the distractions of this intercolonial landdispute should embolden the savages to take an advantage Both sides arrested settlers engaged in vin dicating their respective colonies and the trouble had become so alarming in the spring of 1774 that both colonies sought but without avail to compromise the dispute Surveyors of both sides were rushing to the contested region and plotting their claims The Indians observing this and disappointed that the delay in the organization of the Vandalia colony had deprived them of purchase money for their lands and fearing to lose them through occupation by rival claimants grew troublesome along the frontier This condition was not altogether unwelcome to Dunmore It gave the color of necessity to a proclamation April 25 I774 ordering the militia to be in readiness By this force he might intimidate Pennsylvania punish the Indians and maintain the sovereignty of Virginia beyond the Ohio A few score men landgrabbers and adventurers had already assembled at the mouth of the Kenawha and a hunting party sent out by them had been attacked by wandering Shawnees As the spring wore on these bold fellows at the Kenawha animated by a desire for revenge resolved on a sudden onset upon the Indian towns on the Scioto in the disputed territory They sought a fa mous frontiersman Cresap for a leader and returning up the Ohio to the site of the modern Wheeling recruited their body by addi tional hotheads with whom it mattered little whether the stories of murders which were increasing were of whites by savages or of the Indian by the frontiersman  and there was no dearth of either kind of tale Zane the principal settler of this spot as well as Cresap counselled moderation at least at times but the trepida tion was too widespread for perfect restraint One observer tells us that in a single day a thousand bewildered settlers crossed over the Monongahela towards the east and the whole country was finally stripped of inhabitants except they were forted The war if it came was sure to have one advantage for the whites and that was the single and unhampered purpose of Vir ginia to maintain her own and this she was prepared to do without the aid of her neighborsVirgizna aid tle Quebec Bill 439 Sir William Johnson in New York was doing his best to restrain the Iroquois but that part of these confederates which had advanced into the modern state of Ohio could not be re strained from making common cause with the Delawares and Shawnees Logan was one of these migrated Iroquois and it was his fate to become the pivot of events A small camp of his family and followers on the north side of the Ohio crossing the river to get rum was set upon and killed by some lawless whites Indian runners spread the news of the massacre and Logan vas soon with such a band as he could gather spreading devastation along the Monongahela and Holston and Dunmores war was begun The country north of the Ohio where Dunmore expected to operate was designated in the parliamentary bill now near its passage as heretofore a part of the territory of Canada This phrase struck sharply at the pride of Dunning and others jealous of English honor and Lord North at one time proposed to leave the words out It was urged by the opposition that under such an acknowledgment if the time should ever come for France to regain Canada in a diplomatic balance she could fairly contend for this conceded limit While this apprehension strengthened the opponents of the bill in England the news of its progress through Parliament brought other fears to land speculators in Virginia Some travellers and adventurers in the summer of I773 had formed a company at Kaskaskia which became known as the Illinois Land Company and with these the governor and various gentle men of tidewater Virginia were associated They had bargained with the Inclians for large tracts of land and the deed had been passed Was their purchase now imperilled by this bill What was to be the effect of the measure upon the French traders and denizens of that country and tupon their relations to the Indians  Haldimand was endeavoring to get what information he could of the condition of that country He was instructing Lieutenant Hutchins to leave Pensacola and take the route north by the Mississippi so as to bring him reports Later still he sent Lieu tenant Hall to placate the Indians and prepare the French settlers for the stabler rule of the new bill Gage in London was not less anxiously consulting with North and Dartmouth and conferring with Carleton about its provisions Haldimand was meanwhile constantly reporting new disorders on the Ohio with a suspicion of French intrigue behind the savage irruptions and there was need of haste in applying the assuaging effects of the bill But its opponents were questioning the scheme because they thought440 J Winsor it hopeless and unpatriotic to check an inevitable westward progress Haldimand understood the real purpose of its pro moters when he said that the bill was aimed at preventing the Americans getting possession of the continent Lord Lyttelton recognized the fact that to confine the Americans by such a barrier was to thwart their contest for empire Wedderburn said dis tinctly that it was one object of the bill to prevent the English settling in that country and that the new barrier would allow little temptation  to send settlers north from the Vandalia grant It was not only this territorial expansion of Quebec but the concessions which the bill made to French Catholics greater than any English Romanist could dare expect and the grant of French law in British territory which increased the steady aversion to it of English merchants and which aroused the lord mayor and magistrates of London because they supposed it imperilled British honor For the seaboard colonists to enter that territory and find French law instead of English law and to encounter an established Catholic religion was not likely to strengthen the loyalty whose decadence the ministry was deploring in the older colonies How ever politic the modern historian may think this rehabilitating of French customs to have been for the vastly preponderating French element north of the St Lawrence to include the Ohio country in such provisions is not approved even by such defenders of the ministerial policy as Kingsford the latest historian of Canada There is indeed little to support the charges that the bill was but the first step in reducing the ancient free Protestant colonies to the same state of slavery by setting up  an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule in these colo nies These were phrases used by Congress in an address to the people of Great Britain a few months later October 2I I774 and still more solemnly in the Declaration of Independence They were simply loose sentences used for political ends The parlia mentary opposition which was dignified by the support of Chatham and Burke never ventured to think of any such effect as proceed ing on the Atlantic side of the Alleghanies from these untoward provisions whatever the bravado utterances of Thurlow may have indicated The bill passing the Commons on June I3 while Logan was rendering an Indian war in the designated region inevitable went with amendments to the Lords In this body with a scant attendance of members and after the season was so far advanced that many weary peers had gone to their estates it was passed on June i8 and four days later was approved by the kingVirginia aud the Quebec Bill 441 Before the news could reach Virginia but while the prospect seemed certain that such a bill would become law Dunmore on July I2 instructed Andrew Lewis to descend the Kenawha with a force and cross the Ohio into the Shawnee country Major McDonald gathered some seven hundred sturdy fighters at the settlement of Zane Wheeling whence he shortly dashed upon some Shawnee villages on the Muskingum and won the first success of the war By the last of September when Dunmore arrived to take command there were some thirteen hundred men at Wheeling The real stroke of the war came on the very site of the con templated capital of Vandalia in the angle formed by the junction of the Kenawha with the Ohio  Point Pleasant as it was called The conflict here was the most hotly contested fight which the Indians ever made against the English and it is all the more remarkable as it was the first considerable battle which they had fought without the aid of the French Lewis on arriving at the spot learned from Dunmores messages which the governors scouts had hidden near by that the governor with his forces would be on the Ohio at a point higher up where Lewis was instructed to join him The next day new orders came by which it appeared that Dunmore intended to turn up the Hockhocking River and that Lewis was expected to cross the Ohio and join him in the Indian country When Lewis was thus advised his rear column had not come up and his trains and cattle were still struggling in the wilderness The force which he had with him at Point Pleas ant was a motley one but for forest service a notable body and not a frontier settlement but had contributed to it While Lewis was making ready to obey orders a squad of men out hunting discovered that a horde of Indians was upon them Cornstalk a Shawnee chief had divined Dunmores plan and with a strategic skill unusual with Indians had crossed the Ohio for the purpose of beating his adversary in detail The opposing armies were much alike in numbers say eleven hundred each  per haps more  and in forest wiles the difference was hardly greater Cornstalk soon developed his plan of crowding the whites toward the point of the peninsula Lewis pushed forward enough men to retard this onset while he threw up a line of defence behind which he could retire if necessary He sent by a concealed move ment another force along the banks of the Ohio which gained the Indians flank and by an enfilading fire forced the savage line back In the night Cornstalk thus worsted recrossed the Ohio Meanwhile Dunmore ascending the Hockhocking marched442 J Wibzsor towards the Scioto making some ravages as he went Cornstalk after his defeat had hurriedly joined the tribes opposing Dunmore but he found them so disheartened by his own discomfiture that he soon led a deputation to Dunmores camp and proposed a peace The governor hearing of Lewiss approach and not feeling the need of his aid in the negotiations and fearing that the elation of the victorious borderers might disquiet the now complacent tribes senit messages to Lewis that he should withdraw which Lewis re luctantly did A treaty followed and Dunmore got all he hoped for by bringing peace in reestablishing a new hold for Virginia upon the territory which as he later learned was on the first of the following May to pass by action of Parliament under a new jurisdiction The grasp which Virginia had now taken was to be of great importance in the coming struggle with the king for she had administered a defeat to the Indians which was for some time to paralyze their power in that region It was a grasp that Virginiia was not to relax till she ceded her rights in this territory to the nascent union when the revolt of the colonies was ended a hold that before long she was to strengthen through the wisdom and hardihood shown in her capture of Vincennes Before the battle of Point Pleasant had decided the fate of the Indians the passage of the bill which in early summer had created so little attention in Parliament was met in London by a prodigious cry in September a clamor that William Lee then in England did his best to increase by keeping a continual fire in the papers The bill was not to go into effect till the spring of 1775 and Carleton having returned to Canada Dart mouth in January sent him instructions about putting it in force The ministers letters must have crossed others from the gov ernor informing him of the opposition to the bill even among the French people of the province and of the measures which the revolting colonies were taking to gain the Canadians to their cause In Montreal the bust of the king had been defaced Already in the previous September Congress had reechoed the  prodigious cry  of London and had declared the reestablish ment of the Catholic religion in Quebec to be dangerous in an extreme degree but this mistake in language was discovered and John Dickinson drafted for that body a conciliatory address to the Canadians which in March I775 Carleton informed Dart mouth the disaffected on the St Lawrence were printing and dis tributing in a translation Within a year the lesson of prudence had been forgotten and singularly enough while Congress February 1776 was appointing a commission with one Catholic memberVirginia and ihe Quebec Bill 443 Charles Carroll and a Catholic attendant to proceed to Mlontreal the ardent Huguenot blood of John Jay had colored an address of Congress to English sympathizers by characterizing the Catholic faith as a religion fraught with sanguinary and impious tenets It was only necessary for the loyal Canadians to translate and cir culate Jays imprudent rhetoric to make the efforts of the commis sioners futile Congress again grew wiser when it framed the Declaration of Independence and Dr Shea has pointed out that the allusion to the Quebec bill in that document is  so obscure that few now understand it and on the point of religion it is silent Congress thus failed to undo the Quebec Act by gaining the people it was intended to shield and it was left for Virginia under a pressure instigated by Maryland to make the territory of which Parliament would have deprived her the nucleus of a new empire beyond the mountains JUSTIN WINSOR

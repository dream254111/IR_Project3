Microscopical Observations upon Muscles and the manner of their Production In a Letter from Mr Anthony van Leeuwenhoek F R S Delft June the 10th 1712 N S I Have observd a great many Years ago that the Shell Fish calld Muscles lay their Eggs upon the outside of their Shells and that so regularly one by an other that they may be compared to a String or Band These Eggs or imperfect Muscles lying upon the Shells do continually increase in Strength till at last they come to be perfect Muscles but then you may see remaining upon the Shells a part of the Eggshell which sticks fast to the said Shell till the Skin or Membrane wherewith the Muscles are encompassed is changed In the Month of August 1710 I procured some Mus cles and dissected them according to the best of my Power and found within the Shells on both sides of the Muscle against the Parts of the Fish very thin and weak Membranes which I have taken often out of the Mus cles and placing them before a Microscope I have seen such a vast Number of Motions in the said Membranes that it is not to be described either by Pen or Words and I showd the same likewise to other Persons And C c c c I530 I observed those Appearances not only in one but all the Muscles I dissected especially in such as had not been long out of the Water These Muscles dont lye single but are at least three double on one another and are composed of longish Fibres and each Fibre has on both sides an unconceiv able number of moving Particles These Fibres are not extended lengthways but in breadth and each of them is provided with a great many Joints insomuch that I have been able to count 25 Joints in one of them in the broadest part of the Membrane and they lay as regularly and joyned one with another as you may have observd in the little Bones that shoot out on both sides of the Back Bone of a Fish I placed a small Particle of the aforementioned Membrane before a Microscope And tho that Particle was not the hundredth part so big as a common Grain of Sand yet I discoverd such a vast number of Moti ons in the said small Particle that was broken off from the Membrane that it is incredible to any body but those that have seen it And those Motions were not only Circular but I could discover at least 50 slender Particles in the length which appeard through the Microscope of equal size to 6 Hairs breadth and the thickness of one Hair as they appear to the naked Eye And these Motions continued so long till our Eyes were weary of viewing them but as soon as the moi sture of the Muscle in which the said Particle lay was evaporated the Motions were ended The exceeding small Particles that lay round about were put into such a Motion that one would have taken them for little living Creatures I have endeavoured for several Years to discover the Ovarium or EggNest in the Muscles and now lately up on the 18th of November there was a Present made me of exceeding fine and well tasted Muscles some inferredofinferred which531 which had placed their Eggs in part upon their Shells and others had no Eggs upon their Shells This occa sioned me to diffect several Muscles again whereupon at last I discovered the Ovarium of the Muscle and in a great many of them could see the unborn Muscles as perfect as we could see them with our naked Eyes lying with their sharp end fastned to the String or Vessels by which they receive their Nourishment A few Days after my forementioned Discovery some Muscles were brought me to buy which were very lean like some of the first Muscles and among em I observd about 25 that had not yet placed their Eggs upon their Shells but most of them were still shut up in the Ova rium from which I took a great Number of Eggs which even through the Microscope appeard so small that I could but just discover the Figure of them In some other Muscles the Eggs were bigger And whereas the first unborn Muscles which I judged to be so perfect as to be ready to be placed upon the Shell were of a brownish Colour mixt with little specks so the very small Eggs were clear and transparent but in the larger one might discover some of the Parts of the little Fish within Moreover I took out of the Ovarium of one of the Muscles some Particles that were as big as an unborn Muscle and which were somewhat longer than broad being very white and some of them of a Particular Fi gure So that I stood amazed and began to consider with myself whether these might not be some of those Creatures which are so prejudicial to such as eat Mus cles as we had an Instance some Years ago of a Person whose Body was so swelled with eating Muscles that it was thought he would have dyed of it I turned my Thoughts afterwards upon the Conside ration of the Excrements or Food of the Muscle as it lay in the Guts And I observd a Gut which had its C c c c 2 begin532 beginning or rather its ending in the thinnest part of the Fish where the Shell opens when the Muscle is in the Water and which Gut was very near the extream part of the Fish and run into that part where the Sto mach is I have often separated this Gut from the Fish and squeezing the Matter out of it I always observd that the Earthy Matter which was in the Gut was mingled with a great Number of Grains of Sands of different Magnitudes insomuch that I judged that there was above a Thousand Grains of Sand in one Gut some of which were as large as the Sand upon the Sea Shore but others again so small that a Thousand of them were not equal to one of the aforementioned great Grains of Sands I took a second Gut out of the Muscle which lay deeper in it and therein I also discovered as great a u antity of Sand I have likewise squeezed the Matter out of the Guts of some Muscles in which I fonnd but few Grains of Sands Having examined the two forementioned Guts I imagined to myself that one of them might be that which carried the Food to the Stomach and the other that which carried it off after that it was turned into Chyle I pursued my enquiry into the Gut which was the outermost till I had brought it to the Part which I took for the Stomach and there also I discovered as many Sands in the Matter that lay within it as I had done before in the Guts and one might make greater Disco veries in Muscles were not the Parts of them so sofo and weak Since my last Account I have made several Observa tions upon these Matters and now lately upon the 20th of January last having diffected some Muscles I disco vered not only a great many Sands in their Stomach but I533 I also observd many long and very clear Particles the longest of which as far as I could judge was about the Diameter of a Hair of ones Head others were not a fourth part so long and by the guess of my Eye their thickness was not the eighth part of their length and they were as clear as Crystal so that I imagined them to be Salt Particles I also observd several little Particles in the Matter I took out of the Stomach which I concluded to be Grass or something like it They were composd of very small Tubes or Pipes which I suppose to be the small Parts of Grass for the Pipes were much too small for any Straw In that Matter that I took out of the Stomach I likewise observd several very small Animalcula swiming and had not till now perceivd the Stomach so full of Food nor of so thin a Substance as this was I have moreover observd that in all the great Num ber of Muscles I have opend there were Ovaria or Egg Nests in them and I have taken the Eggs out of them And in those that I opend latest I observed that the Eggs were bigger than I had seen any before So that I concluded that all Muscles brought forth young ones and that the Eggs that were found on the outside of the Shell were not all laid by the Muscle itself but that other Muscles did also lay their Eggs upon each others Shells and accordingly I have observed some Shells that were covered all over with Eggs During the motion of those Parts that have been men tioned above which I shall here call the Beard of the Muscle I have observd several times two or three A nimalcula swimming and the small Parts that lay round about were put into such a Motion that one would be apt also to take them for Animalcula And according to my Judgment after several Observations if not all yet at least most of the Shell Fish bring forth young with out534 out the help of Males So likewise I believe it is in Oysters and I am also of Opinion that that exceed ing Number of small Particles which I discovered in them and which I took for Animalcula are nothing else but the Parts put into a violent Motion But these are not Observations but guesses in relation to the Oysters But if one dwelt upon the Sea Shore and could daily view the Shell Fish one might speak with greater certainty and satisfaction concerning them I never made so many Observations nor with so much Pains as I have done in the Business of Muscles But not being able to do it with Satisfaction my wishes are That the Discoveries about the Production of Shell Fish may be enterd upon by some body else for as for my own Part I give it up and with great Respect I remain Your most humble Servant Anthony van Leeuwenhoek

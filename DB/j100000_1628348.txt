the arrangement is rendered an order of sequence In II 4 the repetition of the word so de stroys the statement intended Could there be a more pitiful bungle than that which in the last two lines of p 6 gives alle iibrigen Punkte der Geraden a heissen ausserhalb der Strecke AB gelegen as all other points are referred to the points lying without the segment AB The translation of the important Axiom IV 1 p 12 is so bungled as to be worse than meaningless actually false as will be seen by comparing with the French translation Si lon designe par A B deux points dune droite a et par A un point de cette mme droite ou bien dune autre droite a lon pourra toujours sur la droite a dun cote donne du point A trouver un point et un seul B tel que le segment AB soit congruent au segment AB On p 13 emanating is unfortunate On p 15 1 10 the anglesymbol is omitted On p 17 1 8 from below so should be such On p 22 theorem 16 is mistranslated the insertion of the word corresponding turning it into bathos But on p 24 we have a still more ludicrous misinterpretation which shows that Professor Townsend has not attempted to understand the book he attempts to translate Under the heading Definitions which should be Defini tion he says From this definition can be easily deduced with the help of the axioms of groups III and IV all of the known properties of the circle What a stupendous blunder this is we realize when we recall that thus cannot even be proved that a straight line which has a point within a circle has a point on the circle What Hilbert himself proves and what Townsend translates on p 116 demonstrates that using axioms IIV we could not even show that from any point without a circle there is a tangent to the circle Just so with out an axiom of continuity we cannot demon N S VOL XVI No 399 strate that a circle having a point within and a point without a second circle has a point on it On the same p 24 the introduction in 1 6 from below of the word corresponding is a childish mistranslation On p 25 Professor Townsend puts in a lit tle from Laugel but seems to have no better luck with his French than with the German This axiom gives us nothing directly con cerning the existence of limiting points or of the idea of convergence is how he renders Cet axiome ne nous dit rien sur lexistence de points limites ni sur la notion de conver gence But the game would not be worth the candle to go on thus through all the 132 pages So I choose as a fitting climax the sentence on p 125 We easily see that the criterion of theorem 44 is fulfilled and consequently it follows that every regular polygon can be con structed by the drawing of straight lines and the laying off of segments From this we should suppose that Professor Townsend studied his geometry from the pop ular treatise of Mr Wentworth between 1877 and 1887 which during those years contained on p 224 Proposition XIII  387 To in scribe a regular polygon of any number of sides in a given circle GEORGE

Herman Schlundt The ionic velocities found are considerably lower than in water but this difference seems to decrease with increasing dilution On the Inversion of Zinc Sulfate II by H T Barnes and H L

Attraction by J E Mills The presentation of evidence to prove that molecular attraction like gravitation varies inversely as the square of the distance apart of the molecules that it is only slightly

in SCIENCE for June 27 and as briefly noted in the report of the Secretary of Section H of the American Association for the Advancement of Science this volume p 201 an American Anthropological Asso ciation was formally established on June 30 The founding meeting was held in Oakland Church Pittsburgh under the Chairmanship of Stewart Culin Vicepresident of Section H of the American Association for the Ad vancement of Science After the adoption of a constitution the following executive officers were elected President W J McGee VicePresident for four years F W Putnam VicePresident for three years Franz Boas VicePresident for two years W H Holmes VicePresident for one year J W Powell Secretary George A Dorsey Treasurer Roland B Dixon Editor F W Hodge The plan of the organization providing for a Council large enough to include the leading workers in American anthropology the follow ing persons all of whom except two who chanced to be abroad had indorsed the objects of the Association were elected Councilors Frank Baker Henry P Bowditch A F Chamberlain Stewart Culin Livingston Far rand J Walter Fewkes Alice C Fletcher J N B Hewitt Walter Hough Ales Hrdlicka A L Kroeber George Grant

arranged to hold the next regular meeting at Washington in connection with the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science during Con vocation Week 190203 A session for the representation of scientific papers was held jointly with Section H as already reported in SCIENCE The following preamble and resolutions were adopted  WHEREAS The Second International American Conference commonly known as the Pan American Congress in session duly as sembled in the City of Mexico January 29 1902 adopted a recommendation to the seve ral American nations participating in the Con ference that an American International Archaeological Commission be created to promote archeological research to aid in the preservation of antiquities and to endeavor to establish an American International Mu seum and WHEREAS The recommendation is in full accord with the spirit and objects of American science therefore  Resolved That the American Anthropolog ical Association heartily concurs in the rec ommendation of the Second International American Conference Resolved further That the Secretary of the Association send a copy of these Resolu tions to the Director of the Bureau of Ameri can Republics as an expression of the judg ment of the Association Undoubtedly the founding of the new as sociation will meet a need long felt by the anthropologists of the United States it was indeed the consummation of a movement started in 1896 when the Anthropological Sec tion of the American Association for the Ad vancement of Science began holding winter meetings The action at Pittsburgh was es pecially notable for the unanimity shown by the representatives of all sections of the coun try Most of the leading anthropologists of America were present in person and it may be said that all were in some way represented AuGusT 22 1902

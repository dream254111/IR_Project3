Housing Committee Massachusetts Civic League Boston rT HE country is at last awake to the presence of a housing problem in the cities For fifty years and more philan thropists have been trying nobly to stem the tide of disease insanity crime involuntary idleness poverty and the whole miserable brood of social ills but the work has grown faster than it can be handled This method of approach has been largely a failure and social students and workers finally have come to see that they must deal with these evils at the point of their origin if they are ever to be conquered and banished from society Three years ago at the meeting of the National Conference of Charities in Richmond Miss Fulmer Superintend ant of the Chicago Visiting Nurse Association declared that twothirds of the deserting fathers onethird of the shiftless mothers and twothirds of the sick and delinquent children came from the congested districts of the cities and it may be added that a very large proportion perhaps twothirds of the current vice crime degeneracy and poverty come from the same local ity The dwellings of the people are a strategic position If they are clean light well ventilated with plenty of space around them neither overcrowded on the land without nor by human beings within you will have a wellordered lawabiding self respecting progressive community If on the other hand dwellings are dark dirty illsmelling unsanitary dilapidated and overcrowded you will have precisely the situation which obtains in every city of any size from Bangor to San Francisco I have said that the country is awake to the housing problem of the city but the country is not yet awake to the fact that similar conditions are developing in hundreds and probably thousands of the smaller towns and by towns and villages I mean places ranging from 500 to 25000 in population They 308HOUSING CONDITIONS IN SMALL TOWNS are most noticeable in places which are near the cities or in which there is some considerable manufacturing interest but you will find them everywhere They are not so evident in the average town but here and there on the outskirts of the village or on back streets and alleys and even in the open country there can be seen old houses or shacks which exhibit all the characteristics of the worst city slum as unsanitary and filthy and overcrowded as any building in the North End of Boston or on the East Side of New York As a rule towns and villages do not have slum districts they have slum spots the possible nuclei of larger areas which under favorable circumstances will develop rapidly These slum spots are of three sorts First there is the dilapidated shack or hovel very often outside the town altogether where people are living in defiance of every law of health and decency I can think of half a dozen such moral pest houses in as many towns in which no farmer who cares anything for his reputation would dream of stabling his cattle It is utterly impossible to make these places fit for habitation and nothing but fire can cleanse them of their filth Drastic treatment is needed for both the buildings and their occupants who are frequently as disreput able as the dwellings Next in country manufacturing towns there are typical tenement houses and lodging houses dingy barracks where the open front door discloses a dark and forbid ding hall and where further investigation reveals all the com mon features of tenementhouse life plus a battery of yard privies stewing and festering under the summer sun and threat ening the health of the entire community There is no excuse for the tenement house in the country there is no excuse for this way of living and where land is as cheap as it is in some parts of most towns and villages every family ought to have a house and seven or eight thousand feet of land to itself A third form of dwellinghouse construction which deteriorates very rapidly and soon falls into the slum class is the three family flat or  threedecker It is enormously popular with speculative builders in both city and country The Dorchester district of Boston has become a city of threedeckers and it is a type which is appearing in the smaller places near the cities 309 7INATIONAL HOUSING ASSOCfIATION These flats are cheap and flimsy sometimes they are furnished with but one stairway and are dangerous firetraps Frequently they are built close to the front line of the lot often only 6 or 7 feet apart and nearly as close together in the rear Some of the rooms in the lower stories may never receive sunlight nor indeed any direct light the yards are damp and dark and lit ered with ashes and garbage They soon fall into the class of slum dwellings and their occupants become a source of expense to the community entailing larger appropriations for schools police fire protection and all the other usual departments while they contribute nothing to the town treasury but an occasional poll tax There is a better class of this type of building which stands in a more spacious lot costs more and is free from some of the worst features of the cheaper flats but even so it is scarcely less objectionable In a recent address at the City Club in Boston President Eliot commenting on the fact that these houses are being built in large numbers in Cambridge where he lives remarked that they house a class of nomads families that are here today and gone tomorrow that have no stable footing in the town and no interest in its affairs A nomad race never has developed a high civilization and he had some apprehension for the effect which a nomad class would have upon ours Apart from the occupants of the threedecker the building itself has a depressing effect on property values and wherever it appears it sends down the price of real estate The housing problem of the small town then is the dilapi dated shack the ordinary overcrowded and unsanitary tenement house and the threedecker flat The situation is full of danger especially in towns which are near the city it may become acute at any moment At the same time it can be handled much more easily than can the conditions in the older cities Slum germs in towns and villages can be destroyed and the future development of slum spots and districts can be prevented I To accomplish this first and foremost there must be a general campaign of education Just as the public is being ed ucated on the subject of tuberculosis so it must be educated on the subject of housing Of the two housing is the more im portant for tuberculosis is a disease of bad housing Let in 310 VOL II 72No 3 HOUSING CONDITIONS IN SMALL TOWNS 73 the sunlight and fresh air and you banish consumption What does it profit the public to spend millions of dollars on hospitals and sanitariums if patients when cured are going back to the dens where they contracted it By all means teach the public how to avoid tuberculosis but above all teach the public so to live that it may crush it out and destroy it The same methods may well be followed that the antituberculosis societies are pur suing Short and pithy circulars should be prepared which can be distributed broadcast each one of which should drive home some pointed facts An effort should be made to get the sub ject before as many groups of people as possible in the towns and villageswomens clubs church clubs lodges trade unions debating societies and any other available gatherings The stereopticon is very useful and should be used wherever possi ble because what is seen makes a much stronger impression than what is heard The suggestion has been made that moving picture films on this subject might be used with great effect Traveling exhibitions should be prepared showing housing con ditions in towns and cities pointing out the effects in terms of disease death crime delinquency and poverty and also show ing examples of towns which have met these evils and overcome them or which have taken steps to escape them altogether The exhibition may well be left in the town library for ten days after an address has been made before a local organization and together with well written circulars will do much to sustain public interest 2 An effort should be made to get the towns to adopt a simple tenementhouse law as a part of the town bylaws Such a law should aim to improve the public health and to protect life against danger from fire Towns do not require and ought never to be cursed with tenement houses If there is any disposition to put up buildings more than two and onehalf stories high or housing more than two families it may well be provided as a preventive measure that they shall be of fireproof construction The proportion of the lot which can be built upon the distance between buildings the size and lighting of rooms the necessary sanitary safeguards and healthful maintenance should be regu lated and these measures if properly enforced will go far towards 2 1  3IIVol I1 NATIONAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION warding off the evils which now afflict the cities A number of towns in Massachusetts are at work upon such housing bylaws and more will fall into line next year Sooner or later recourse will no doubt be had to the General Court but it is interesting to note that meanwhile the towns are looking out for themselves 3 An efficient board of health is necessary to enforce any such bylaw and in Massachusetts at least there is room for great improvement in the personnel of the country boards As now constituted the chairman may be a physician but not necessarily for the law does not require the presence of a physician on the board the other members are very likely to have meager quali fications for their work A board has large powers and its members should be chosen from the best equipped and most conscientious men in the community In the discharge of its duties it will frequently come into conflict with fellow townsmen especially in the enforcement of an effective housing law and its members should be men who are not afraid to act An energetic and fearless board would make short work of the dis reputable shacks scattered around the country which are now being used as dwellings Here again is seen the necessity for general information as to the principles of good housing and the dangers of bad housing because if public opinion on the subject is not aroused it will be very difficult to get the best men to serve on boards of health and to secure backing for them if they do consent to serve Even under a state law the local boards in Massachusetts at least will naturally be charged with its enforcement so in any case the personnel of the board is a matter of great importance 4 A town plan will be found a valuable aid in securing the right kind of housing City planning is becoming common but thus far the movement has scarcely reached the towns although a plan is just as desirable for a town as it is for a city Beside securing the more popular features of town life a plan may pro vide for the laying out of new streets so that dwellings upon them will receive the maximum of sunlight in the living and sleeping rooms may provide for roadways of suitable width and construction thus materially affecting the value of abutting prop erty may insure the planting of trees in such numbers as to 312 74No 3 HOUSING CONDITIONS IN SMALL TO WNS 75 save a town from the hideous bareness of streets so often seen may establish the sizes of lots combining with this regulation a bylaw fixing the proportion of the lot which can be built upon so that proper light and ventilation will forever be preserved and may fix a building line and a height of construction which may not be exceeded Such provisions and regulations of any kind will be bitterly fought by land speculators and speculative builders in rapidly growing towns but they will be of immense service in preventing the evils which come from overcrowding the land and which are already showing themselves in towns and villages where those evils ought never to have been permitted to gain a foothold 5 Much attention should be given to small houses for the families of wageearners The ideal of life for any family is a house to itself well built and sanitary containing from four to six rooms and bath or at least with some provision for bathing and with land enough about it for a garden the rent to range from 10 to 25 per month A constant excuse for the tene ment house in the country town is that at the present prices of building material and labor it is impossible to build single houses to rent for as low as io per month If this is true it means that unskilled labor earning from 170 to 2 or 225 per day cannot live decently and healthfully and reproduce itself and this is a situation which may well cause alarm It is intoler able that human beings should be condemned to such conditions of living anywhere and most of all is it intolerable in the smaller communities and if there is no escape we need not be surprised if the rumblings of social discontent grow louder But I do not believe it is true that single houses are beyond the reach of the unskilled laborer I am not an architect nor the son of an architect and may not be able to give a very good reason for the faith that is in me but I do know that Washington and Phila delphia have come very near to a solution of this problem with their one and twofamily houses with three and four rooms and bath to the apartment renting for from 9 to 12 per month and I believe that when the same intelligence and skill are applied to the problem of securing the small detached house at these rates in country towns the problem will be solved In this connection 313NATIONAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION an interesting item appeared in a recent number of the Survey in which it was stated that the Worcester County Institution for Savings in Worcester Massachusetts has prepared a large collection of plans for such houses to cost from 1500 to 5000 each which it offers for the free use of the public This is an attack upon the housing problem from the constructive side which ought to be widely imitated 6 Taxation has the closest connection with housing reform in the cities and with the encouragement of good housing in the towns Vacant land does not bear its proper burden There are towns where it is extremely difficult to get land for building purposes at anything like a fair price because it is held for speculation and yet it is taxed at a low valuation compared with land similarly located which is already built upon This policy inevitably checks building and raises rents On the other hand tax land to its full value as land whether occupied or not make it more expensive to hold it than to use it and building will be stimulated rents will fall and the housing problem will be solved in the cities and will never appear in country towns and this conference will go out of business 7 Fight the threedecker at every point Demand that it be of fireproof construction if it must be built at all The Wor cester County Institution for Savings refuses to make loans on this class of property a public service for which it deserves thanks Urge a general extension of this policy and if in addition the insurance companies would refuse to insure which is extremely unlikely the situation would be under control These are some of the ways in which this question of bad housing can be approached in the towns Several are imme diately practicable others will have to win their way to favor and adoption but together they will do much to secure healthy and attractive homes for all the people 314 76

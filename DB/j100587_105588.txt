SENTIMENTS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR READ JAN 29  FEB5176147 YOUR OWN WHILE THEY ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER USEFUL TRUTH I PRESUME TO LAY BEFORE YOU A GREAT MASTER OF THE SUBJECT ON WHICH I WRITE SOME HINTS RELATING TO WHAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED AND HOPE TO GIVE AS HAS BEEN DESIRED 1 A LITTLE FURTHER LIGHT BY WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED FROM MY OWN PARISH FOR 24 YEARS PAST HAVING NOTED THE PARTICULAR AGES OF 1700 PERSONS BURIED IN THAT TIME 2 FROM THE LONDON BILLS MORE ESPECIALLY ON THE AGE OF 100 YEARS AND UP WARDS AND FROM THE ACCOUNTS OF EVERY OTHER PLACE I COULD PROCURE I SHALL MENTION AT PRESENT A FEW LEAD ING POINTS ONLY AND THOSE AS BRIEFLY AS I CAN SENSIBLE OF YOUR ABILITY TO TRACE THEIR CONSEQUENCES AND PRE SENT THEM AS THEY OCCUR TO MIND ON VIEW OF YOUR TABLE AND DISCOURSE IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS VOL XLIX P 167 COMPARING THE BURIALS OF LONDON AND BRESLAU YOU SAY 8110 DIE AT LONDON AND 202 AT BRESLAU UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE I ACKNOWLEGE IT NOT ONLY YOURS BUT A CURRENT OPINION TAKEN AS A FIRST PRIN CIPLE THAT AT BRESLAU ABOUT 15 OF THOSE THAT ARE BORN DIE UNDER THAT AGE AND THE PLACE HAS BEEN CELE BRATED FOR ITS HEALTHFULNESS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL CARE OF INFANTS IN PARTICULAR AND FOR THE GOOD CONSTITUTION AND LONGEVITY OF ITS INHABITANTS IN GENERAL A PLACE MUCH ENVIED AND MUCH CONTENDED FOR NOW I GRANT THAT THE NUMBERS 145 AND 57 MAKE 202 AND THAT 1000  202  798 WHICH STAND IN THE

OF THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS TWICE TAKEN FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE YEAR48 YEAR IN DR HALLEYS TABLE BUT STILL CAN BY NO MEANS ADMIT THE INFERENCE AND AM SURPRIZED IT SHOULD EVER BE IMAGINED THAT OF 1000 CHILDREN BORN AT BRESLAU 202 ONLY DIE UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE FOR VERY GOOD REASONS TO BE FOUND IN THE BOOK OF NATURE AND IN DR HALLEYS DISSERTATION TOO AS I SHALL MAKE APPEAR BY AND BY IN THE MEAN TIME LET ME OBSERVE HOW MUCH IT WERE TO BE WISHED THAT ALL WHO WRITE UPON THIS SUBJECT WOULD BEGIN FROM THE BIRTH OR 0 YEAR AND GIVE A TRUE ANNUAL REGISTER OF THE GROWING THE MOST CONFIRMED AND THE DECLINING STATE OF LIFE BY SOME METHOD DEVISED TO MAKE IT VISIBLE AT ONCE AS I SHALL SHEW HEREAFTER WITHOUT LEAVING THE READER TO TRY THE NUMBERS SINGLY UPON EVERY OCCASION FOR WHILE SOME ACCOUNT FROM THE QUICK CONCEPTIONS 3 AS IN THE LONDON BILLS OTHERS FROM THE LIVING BIRTHS AS IS YOUR WAY AND I THINK THE BEST OTHERS FROM 6 OR 9 MONTHS OR A FULL YEAR AFTER THE BIRTH AS DR HAL LEY AND MRKERSEBOOM HAVE DONE AND GREAT IS THE TRANSITION FROM 0 YEAR OR THE BIRTH TO THOSE OF 1 YEAR OLD THERE MUST ARISE CONFUSION AT FIRST SETTING OUT AND APPARENT IF NOT REAL CONTRADICTIONS IN COM PARING ONE ACCOUNT WITH ANOTHER AND IT SHOULD LIKEWISE BE WELL REMEMBERED THAT IF A LESS NUMBER ARE TAKEN FOR THE DEATHS IN THE FIRST STAGE OF LIFE THAN THERE OUGHT TO BE THE MORE IN COURSE ARE THROWN 4 BACK UPON THE ENSUING DECADS OF YEARS AND THUS A WHOLE TABLE MAY BE EFFECTED BY THE FIRST YEAR ONLY 3 GRAUNTS OBSERVATIONS ON THE BILLS OF MORTALITY 5TH EDIT 1676 P 22 84 85 AND FROM HENCE ABORTIVES AND STILLBORN ARE INCLUDED IN THE BURIALS 4 SEE AT THE END OF THIS LETTER P 69 C D E AND F UNFAIRLY49 UNFAIRLY REPRESENTED AS DR HALLEYS CERTAINLY IS IF HE EVER MEANT AS HE IS GENERALLY BUT I THINK NOT RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD I SAID I COULD NOT ADMIT THAT OF 1000 CHILDREN BORN AT BRESLAU 202 ONLY DIED UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE AND HAVING PREPARED YOU FOR IT SHALL NOW GIVE YOU THE REASON DR HALLEY STATES THE BIRTHS 5 CERTAIN AT 1238 AND ADDS FARTHER THAT 348 OF THEM DO DIE IN THE FIRST YEAR THAT BUT 890 ARRIVE AT A FULL YEARS AGE AND THAT 198 MORE DO DIE IN THE 5 YEARS NEXT FOLLOWING UPON WHICH DATA I STATE THOSE

IT VERY PLAIN THAT OUT OF 1238 BIRTHS AT BRESLAU 424 DIE UNDER 2 YEARS OLD AND THEREFORE OUT OF 1000 342 DIE UNDER THAT AGE WHICH IS SOMEWHAT MORE THAN I OBSERVE IN MY PARISH 5 LOWTHORPS ABRIDGMENT 5TH EDIT 1749 VOLIII P 669 V O L LII H THOUGH50 THOUGH MINE EXCEEDS MR KERSEBOOMS 6 ACCOUNT AND I AM BETTER PLEASED TO FIND THAT WHAT I TAKE FOR THE TRUTH LIES BETWEEN THEM AND HERE I SHALL VEN TURE TO ASSURE YOU UPON THE WHOLE THAT WHEN BROUGHT TO THE DUE PROPORTIONALS FOR 1000 BIRTHS ONLY THE ACCOUNT OF BRESLAU FALLS IN BETWEEN 7 THOSE OF MY PARISH AND OF ALLSAINTS IN NORTHAMPTON SO THAT IN REALITY THERE IS NOTHING EITHER REMARKABLY 8 HEALTHFUL OR LONGLIVED IN THE INHABITANTS OF BRESLAU AS HAS BEEN IMAGINED BY MISTAKING OUR AUTHORS MEANING WHO PERHAPS MIGHT INTEND HIS AGES SHOULD IMPLY THE MIDDLE OF EVERY YEAR HIS TITLE BEING AGE CURRENT AND FROM THE 1238 THREW OFF 238 ONLY FOR 6 MONTHS OR MORE AT FIRST SETTING OUT AND NOT THE WHOLE 348 AS HE WOULD HAVE DONE IF INTENDED FOR THE WHOLE YEAR HOWEVER LET HIS DESIGN BE WHAT IT WILL THE NUMBER 692 BEING THE REMAINDER OF 1238 AFTER 6 YEARS DEATHS IS PLACED IN HIS TABLE AND IF WE TAKE THE 692 AND WHAT FOLLOWS THENCEFORTH WE MUST NOT FORGET WITH WHAT NUMBER THE AUTHOR BEGAN NOR CONFOUND HIS WITH OTHER TABLES THAT REALLY BEGIN WITH 1000 BIRTHS BECAUSE THIS HAS 1000 PERSONS IN THE FIRST YEAR IT IS WITH GREAT REGRET THAT I MENTION ANY BLE MISHES IN THIS TABLE SO MUCH AND DESERVEDLY ESTEEMED WHICH HAS GIVEN THE LEAD TO MANY OTHERS OF THE LIKE YEAR LIVES DIE 6 MR KERSEBOOMS TABLE BEGINS 1  1125  50 BUT THE FIRST YEAR FROM THE BIRTH IS SUPPRESSED AND 0 YEAR SHOULD BE 1400  275 HE MIGHT HAVE SAID THIS PLAINLY TO PREVENT ANY STUMBLING AT THE THRESHOLD 7 SEE P 69 D H K AND L 8 WARDS CLAVIS ASURAE P 111 HODGSON PREF STONE HOUSE PREF P 7 KIND51 KIND BUT I CANNOT SAY IT IS EXACT FOR BY DEPARTING FROM HIS PRELIMINARY 9 DISCOURSE IN THE FIRST 6 YEARS AND VARYING HIS TABLE FROM THE STATED PROPORTIONS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE AGES THEREIN SET FORTH IT IS CERTAIN THE ONE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE OTHER TILL THE YEARS 57 TO 62 AND IN THE SINGLE YEARS 72 AND 80 AND IT WERE MUCH TO BE WISHED THAT DR NEWMANS PAPERS WERE MADE PUBLIC TO DISCOVER THE ORIGIN AND JUSTNESS OF THOSE PROPORTIONAL NUMBERS HOW THEY PROVE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND FROM WHAT LEADING PROPORTIONS THEY WERE DEDUCED HOWEVER IF THE CONSIDERATION OF THE FIRST YEAR WAS THE ONLY REASON FOR DESIRING THEM IT MIGHT BE NEEDLESS THERE BEING ANOTHER PASSAGE IN THE SAME DISSERTATION WHICH FURTHER CONFIRMS WHAT I ASSERT WHERE SPEAKING OF THESE TABLES OF DR NEWMAN ABOUT TO BE RANGED IN PARTICULAR FORM BY HIMSELF HE MAKES THIS OBSERVATION 10 IT APPEARS HEREBY THAT THE ONE HALF OF THOSE THAT ARE BORN DIE IN 17 YEARS TIME 1238 BIRTHS BEING IN THAT TIME REDUCED TO 616 FOR WE CANNOT BY ANY MEANS APPLY THESE WORDS TO THE NUMBER 1000 IN HIS OWN TABLE WHICH ARE NOT REDUCED TO HALF TILL NEAR THE 34TH YEAR AN ASSURANCE TO ALL THAT KNOW ANY THING OF THESE MAT TERS THAT 1000 BIRTHS AND 1000 PERSONS THE ONE IN THE BEGINNING OF LIFE THE OTHER IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS TABLE MEAN VERY DIFFERENT THINGS AND THAT ANY CONCLUSIONS TRULY DRAWN FROM THE ONE MAY BE VERY FALSE WHEN TRANSFERRED TO THE OTHER 9 A GENERAL STATE OF THESE MAY BE SEEN P 69 A YEARLY ONE WOULD TAKE UP TOO MUCH ROOM HERE THOUGH I HAVE IT BEFORE ME 10 LOWTHORPS ABRIDGMENT VOL III P 677 H 2 IF52 IF SOME MISTAKES AND UNFAIR COMPARISONS ARISE FROM DIVERS TABLES NOT BEGINNING ALL FROM THE SAME POINT IF IN THE LONDON ACCOUNTS THE ABORTIVE AND STILBORN MUST BE THROWN OUT AND ALSO AN ALLOWANCE MADE FOR AS MANY AS DIE IN THE GREATER PART OF THE FIRST YEAR WHILE THE 1238 BRESLAU BIRTHS WERE RE DUCING TO 1000 PERSONS ONLY BEFORE A JUST COMPA RISON CAN BE MADE WITH DR HALLEYS TABLE AS IT NOW STANDS THEN THE 8110 AT LONDON 11 MUST BE RE DUCED OR ELSE THE 202 OR RATHER THE 342 ABOVE MENTIONED BE FURTHER INCREASED BY AN ALLOWANCE FOR SUCH ABORTIVE AND STILBORN AND WHEN THESE ALTERA TIONS ARE MADE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE TWO PLACES WILL NOT APPEAR SO AMAZINGLY DIFFERENT IN PROPORTION TO THEIR RESPECTIVE NUMBERS UPON THE WHOLE BESIDE THE INCONVENIENCE OF THE VARIOUS ACCOUNTS NOT BEGINNING TOGETHER I SHALL ADD ANOTHER OBJECTION NO LESS MATERIAL THAT THE TABLES ARE FORMED IN TOO SMALL NUMBERS AND BY THAT MEANS CUT OFF 20 OR 30 YEARS OF THE TERM OF LIFE AND UNDERVALUE IT IN ANNUITIES AS NOTHING WORTH HE THAT BEGINS WITH 1000 ONLY EITHER STOPS SHORT OF 90 OR RUNS QUITE OUT BETWEEN THE 95TH AND 100TH YEAR AND CAN GO NO FURTHER BECAUSE OUT OF 1000 BIRTHS IT IS NOT EX PECTED SO MUCH AS ONE SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE AGE OF 100 YEARS BUT WHAT MUST BECOME OF THOSE MANY 11 ADDING 2000 TO THE BURIALS DIVIDED BY 10 IS IN EFFECT ADDING 20000 TO THE WHOLE THE INCREASED COLUMN IS 5 SHORT WHICH WOULD ARISE FROM ADDITIONAL PARTS LOST AND MAKE THE FULL SUM THE LAST NUMBER IN THE BRESLAU COLUMN SHOULD NOT BE 33 BUT 27 DR BRAKENRIDGE IN53 IN THE LONDON 12 ACCOUNTS FOR INSTANCE IN THE 30 YEARS 1728 TO 1757 INCLUSIVE 2979 LIVING AT 90 242 LIVING AT 100 10 LIVING AT 110 AND ONE LIVING TO 138 ARE THESE TO BE WHOLLY OMITTED BY THOSE WHO PRETEND TO GIVE A TRUE STATE OF HUMAN LIFE THE FIRST NUMBER NEAR THRICE AS MANY AS THE USUAL TABLES BEGIN WITH OR COULD THEY BE OVERLOOKED IF THE COMPUTATION BEGAN WITH 100000 OR A MILLION FURTHER SHOULD THE VALUE OF ANNUITIES SINK SO PRE CIPITATELY AND CLOSE SO SOON WILL THEY BE GRANTED TO PERSONS AGED 95 FOR NOTHING AS THE TABLE OF MR DE PARCIEUX HAS IT IN THE SUPPLEMENT TO CHAMBERSS DICTIONARY ONE WOULD IMAGINE THENCE THAT THOSE AGED 100 OR MORE SHOULD HAVE A PREMIUM TO AC CEPT OF THEM AND YET WHAT WOULD BE THE CON SEQUENCE IF THE STATE GRANTED AN ANNUITY TO 100000 PERSONS AND THE SURVIVORS OF THEM TO SUBSIST INTIRE TO THE DEATH OF THE LONGEST LIVER AND HAVE IT TO PAY 20 OR 30 YEARS BEYOND THE UTMOST EXPECTATION RE PRESENTED IN SUCH TABLES IT MAY HERE BE OBSERVED IN RESPECT TO LONDON MORE PARTICULARLY THAT THE INDUCTION FROM THIS RESIDUARY PART OF LIFE IS WELL SUPPORTED SINCE AT 90 OR LATER FEW THINK OF RE MOVING FROM TOWN OR IF IT BE INSISTED UPON THAT SOME DO REMOVE AFTER THAT AGE IT WILL BE ALLOWED THAT THE BURIALS OF THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER IF THEY HAD ALL STAID AND DIED THERE IT MAY SEEM QUITE IMPERTINENT TO MENTION THIS TO 12 MR STONEHOUSE FORMS HIS ACCOUNT ON 529623 OF WHICH 181 LIVED TO 100 YEARS AND UPWARDS YET BEGINNING WITH 1000 CLOSES HIS TABLE AT 95 IT IS NEEDLESS TO NAME MANY OTHERS IN A GENERAL FAULT TO WHICH THE EASY MANAGEMENT OF SMALL NUMBERS IS A TEMPTATION YOU54 YOU WHO HAVE ASSURED US IN GENERAL TERMS THAT THE BURIALS 13 AFTER 50 ARE LESS THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE ALLOWING THE ACCOUNTS SUFFICIENTLY CORRECT AND THE NUMBERS IN LATER LIFE NOT EXAGGERATED BUT RATHER THE CONTRARY IT WILL BE FOUND THEN OF PARTICULAR SERVICE THAT FOR THOSE OF 100 YEARS OLD AND UPWARDS WE HAVE THE AGE OF EVERY SINGLE DEATH AND FORMING A TABLE OF THEM YEARLY DECREASING AND APPLYING DR HALLEYS THIRD RULE OF HALVING THE TABULAR LIVES IN ANY YEAR TO DISCOVER THE TERM EXPECTED IT WILL COME OUT THAT A LIFE BEING LIKE ONE OF THE 242 AGED 100 HAS AN EQUAL CHANCE TO LIVE 2 YEARS 3 QUARTERS OR MORE 14 AND BY HIS PROCESS FOR FINDING THE VALUE FROM YEARLY CHANCES AND AT 5 PER CENT IT AMOUNTS TO MORE THAN TWO YEARS AND A HALF PURCHASE 15 NOW BY YOUR TABLE A LIFE OF 85 HAS NOT A BETTER EXPECTATION AND FOLLOWING TOO CLOSE UPON YOUR HEELS MR DODSON VALUES AN ANNUITY OF 1 L FOR A LIFE 16 OF 88 BUT AT 6 S AND 5 D READY MONEY I SHALL NOT CONTROVERT THIS POINT BUT DESIRE TO KNOW WHO WILL GRANT SUCH ANNUITIES OR GREATER FOR ALL THAT COULD BE FOUND OF THAT AGE OR AS MANY OF THEM AS SHOULD BE SELECTED FOR NOMINEES I SAY NOTHING OF THE FIRST NUMBER IN HIS TABLE DOUBTLESS YOU MEAN BY 1 THE FIRST YEAR OF NEWBORN CHILDREN AND YET IF HE MEANS THE SAME 13 PHIL TRANS VOL XLIX P 175 14 AS ALL THE TABLES DO OR WOULD REDUCE LIFE TO 0 BEFORE 100 HOW WILL THEY EMERGE AGAIN TO JOIN CONFORMABLY WITH THESE IN TERM EXPECTED OR VALUE YET THESE ARE REALITIES SET IN PUBLIC VIEW 15 PROCESS IN MS FOL 4 16 PHIL TRANS VOL XLIX P 891 5 AND55 AND VALUES AN ANNUITY FOR A NEWBORN CHILD WHOSE EQUAL CHANCE OF LIFE IS NOT 4 YEARS AT 1251 YEARS PURCHASE IT APPEARS TO ME GREATLY OVERRATED AND I SHOULD SUSPECT SOME FALLACY IN THE METHOD OF COM PUTATION ANOTHER THING I SHALL PROPOSE TO YOUR CONSIDERATION IS THE FORMING A CONTINUAL REGISTER IF I MAY USE THAT TERM OF THE PROPORTIONS OF LIVES AND DEATHS BY ADDING AFTER EACH YEAR HOW MANY WOULD HAVE DIED OUT OF 1000 OR ONE OUT OF HOW MANY OR BOTH OF THEM IN SUBSEQUENT COLUMNS WITH THE DIFFERENCES INCREASING OR DECREASING FROM YEAR TO YEAR IF ONE ONLY BE USED I RATHER PREFER THE FORMER AS IT STRIKES THE EYE IS A MORE NATURAL REPRESENTATION OF INCREASING MORTA LITY AND SHEWS AT ONCE IF 1000 WERE TO BEGIN EVERY SINGLE YEAR HOW MANY OF THEM WOULD DIE IN THAT YEAR IN PROPORTION TO THE LIVES AND DEATHS OF SUCH YEAR IN THE TABLE THE LATTER MAY BE MORE AGREEABLE TO OTHERS AND IS OF SINGULAR USE TOWARDS THE END OF LIFE I SHALL GIVE A SPECIMEN OF BOTH ON YOUR TABLE FOR 3 DECADS BY WHICH YOU WILL BETTER PERCEIVE WHAT I MEAN AND THE USES 17 THAT MAY BE MADE OF THEM

C BY THE WAY I MUST GIVE A REASON WHY I SUM UP THE COLUMN OF LIVES WHICH I CONSIDER AS SO MANY ANNUAL EX POSURES AND THIS AS THE TOTAL OF THE LIVES EACH EX POSED TO THE CHANCE OF MORTALITY FOR ONE YEAR I E 406 IN THE FIRST 402 IN THE SECOND C AND 3885 IN THE TEN YEARS AND UPON THE WHOLE 38 DEATHS EXP DIE EXP DIE AND THENCE 3885 38 10000 97812 WHICH LAST TERM IS THE PROPER STATE OR DEGREE OF MORTALITY FOR THAT DECAD AND 978 A MEAN THEREOF AT AN AVER AGE IT IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME ONE BE TWEEN THE 10TH AND 20TH IS THE HEALTHIEST YEAR I E THE YEAR IN WHICH FEWEST WOULD DIE OUT OF 1000 AND THE ANNUAL DEGREE 18 OF MORTALITY SHOULD IN CREASE SWIFTER OR SLOWER AS IT HAPPENS FROM THENCE TO THE END OF LIFE BUT HOW IS SUCH YEAR TO BE FOUND AMONG THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE FIRST OF THESE THREE DECADS OR HOW SHALL WE LOOK UPON 10 11 14 15 AS A DUE PROGRESSION IN THE SECOND AND IF THE NUM BERS 16 19 20 DO GO ON INCREASING IN THE THIRD WHY DOES THE DEGREE OF MORTALITY GO BACK TO 17 THEN FORWARD TO 20 THEN BACK TO 17 AGAIN AND FORWARD TO 21 PER MILLE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE OUT OF 498 SHOULD DIE AT THE AGE OF 36 AND BUT ONE OUT OF 586 AT THE AGE OF 37 AND AGAIN ONE OUT OF 48 SHOULD DIE AT THE AGE OF 38 AND BUT ONE OUT OF 564 AT THE AGE OF 39 IS NOT THIS REPRESENTING THE 37TH 18 A MISTAKEN INFERENCE FROM THIS SEE P 65 NOTE 30 V O L LII I YEAR58 YEAR OF LIFE AS A HEALTHIER

CANNOT FA THOM THEM WITH ME IT IS NOT A MATTER PECULIAR TO YOUR TABLE BUT A CERTAIN CONSEQUENCE OF BEGINNING WITH 1000 ONLY FOR HAVING NO CHANGES BUT WHAT AMOUNT TO AN UNIT MORE OR AN UNIT LESS THAT IS TOO GREAT A LEAP AT ONCE IN SUCH SMALL NUMBERS WHEN THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN 500 AND 600 DEATHS ROOM TO EXPRESS DUELY THE INTERMEDIATE GRADATIONS OF IN CREASE OR DECREASE FOR EVERY SINGLE YEAR THE

COLUMN PER MILLE SHOULD INCREASE AND THAT ONE OUT OF SHOULD DECREASE WITH SOME SORT OF RE GULARITY I SAY NO MORE OF THESE REFERRING TO WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN ABOVE MY DESIGN HERE IS TO SHEW THAT THE TERM OF LIFE 19 DECREASING TOO SWIFTLY SINKS BELOW THE TRUTH AND THEN STANDS STILL OR INCREASES TO BECOME AGREEABLE TO THE RULE OF NATURE FOUND IN THE COURSE OF SUBSEQUENT YEARS THESE IRREGULARITIES AND DISPROPORTIONS MIGHT BE AVOIDED BY BEGINNING WITH 4300 AND 6800 OR IT MIGHT BE AS SATISFACTORY TO MANY TO DECREASE THE 412 YEARS EXPECTED TO 275 BY PROPER INTERVALS OR DIFFERENCES GREATER ABOVE THAN BELOW AN EXPEDIENT NOT TO BE DESPISED WHEN THE CAPITAL POINTS FROM AND TO WHICH ARE PREVIOUSLY SETTLED ON GOOD AUTHORITY THE TERM FOUND BY DR HALLEYS TABLE IS STILL WIDER FROM THE DUE COURSE I AM APT TO IMAGINE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THESE DIFFI CULTIES INDUCED YOU TO STOP SHORT AND PERHAPS YOU WILL WONDER THAT ANY ONE ELSE WOULD TAKE THE PAINS TO SURMOUNT THEM BUT TO RETURN YOU MAY POSSIBLY THINK IT UNREA SONABLE THAT ANY BODY SHOULD INSIST UPON SUCH A VA RIETY OF SCRUPLES IN A CASE WHERE THE BEST MEANS OF INFORMATION ARE TOO LAX AND GENERAL YET I HOPE WILL EXCUSE THEM WHEN ASSURED THAT MY SOLE REASON FOR INSISTING UPON THEM IS NOT A PRONENESS TO FIND FAULTS BUT AN EARNEST YOU MAY CALL IT AN OVEREARNEST DESIRE TO MAKE WHAT WE HAVE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND ATTAIN FURTHER MEANS OF SUCH KNOWLEGE AND STATE 19 I USE THIS AS THE SHORTEST FORM MEANING THE EQUAL CHANCE OR PROBABLE EXPECTATION OF LIFE AS MANY SURVIVING AS DYING BEFORE SUCH PERIOD AMONG LIVES OF THE GIVEN AGE THEM61 THEM IN THE LEAST EXCEPTIONABLE MANNER FOR TILL WE GET A MORE AUTHENTIC ACCOUNT OF LIFE OR USE WHAT WE HAVE WITHOUT TOO MUCH OBSEQUIOUSNESS TO GREAT NAMES WE SHALL BE AS IF BLIND AND FETTERED DURING SUCH PREJUDICES AND RESTRAINT IT IS TOO EARLY TO COMPUTE VALUES WITH MINUTE PRECISION AS SOME DO AND WRANGLE ABOUT TRIFLES WHILE THEY SUFFER FIRST PRINCIPLES OF GREATER MOMENT TO PASS QUITE UNREGARDED WHETHER MY CONJECTURE BE RIGHT OR NOT DR HAL LEY HAD REASONS WHY HE LEFT OFF AT 84 AS YOU MAY HAVE FOR ENDING AT 87 AND THE TERM OF FINAL DI RECTION IS SETTLED BY ANOTHER GREAT MASTER 20 AT 86 BUT WHEN MANY PERSONS OUTLIVE SUCH TABLES AND ARE MOST DESIROUS TO PURCHASE ANNUITIES UPON EASY TERMS FOR THEIR LIVES AND HAVE NO RULE AT ALL LEFT IT MUST BE VERY ACCEPTABLE BY WHOMSOEVER FAITHFULLY PERFORMED TO HAVE A TABLE BEGINNING WITH THE LIVING BIRTHS FORMED UPON 100000 LIVES AT LEAST AND CARRIED ON TO THE EXTREMITY I SHOULD ALMOST SAY THE UTMOST POS SIBILITY OF LIFE WITH THE SWIFT OR SLOW INCREASE OF AN NUAL MORTALITY NOTED IN A SUBSEQUENT COLUMN AND IN CONSEQUENCE THE TERM OR EXPECTATION PROPERLY DECREASING FROM THE BEST LIFE ABOUT 5 OR 6 TILL THE WHOLE BE EXHAUSTED AND IT WOULD BE A SATISFACTION TO ME IF BY SUGGESTING ANY HINTS IT MAY PUT ABLER HANDS AT WORK TO BRING IT AT LAST TO SUCH A PERFECT STATE AS I CONCEIVE AT PRESENT IN IMAGINATION ONLY IN PROSPECT OF THIS GIVE ME LEAVE TO OBSERVE THAT THE NUMBERS IN THOSE COLUMNS PER MILLE AND ONE OUT 20 MR DE MOIVRE PREF P V EDIT 1725 TRACT P 10 47 76 79 THIS STRIKES OFF 14 YEARS OF DR HALLEYS TABLE YOUNGER LIVES CAN HARDLY LOOK SO FAR FORWARD BUT OLD PERSONS SEE THEM AT HAND AND THE VALUE OF ALL EXPECTATIONS IS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR NEAR APPROACH 3 OF62 OF MAY BE OF USE FOR SUCH A PURPOSE AS DIRECTORS AND BY INVERTING THE PROPORTIONALS BE APPLIED TO FIND THE DEATHS OF LIVES GIVEN FROM YEAR TO YEAR 21 FOR AS THESE MAY BE PREVIOUSLY DIGESTED WITH GREATER REGULARITY AND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FOUND BY MUL TIPLYING THE GIVEN LIVES BY THE FORMER OR DIVIDING THEM BY THE LATTER A WAY IS OPENED FOR CONDUCTING THE WORK IN LARGER NUMBERS AND WITH GREAT EXACT NESS AND I CONCEIVE THAT TEN OF THE BEST ACCOUNTS OF DIFFERENT PLACES EACH FORMED BY PROPORTION FOR 10000 BIRTHS AND ALL THROWN TOGETHER IN THE USUAL SECTIONS IF PROPERLY AIDED IN THE LATTER PART OF LIFE BY THE LONDON BILLS MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT AT LEAST WOULD BE MUCH BETTER THAN ANY THING WE HAVE FOR TABLES OF 1000 1238 OR 1400 ARE QUITE DISTANCED HERE HAVING NO LIVES AT ALL OF 100 YEARS AND YET WHO CAN BELIEVE THAT DR HALLEYS 34000 IF THEY WERE SO MANY MUCH LESS MR KERSEBOOMS 980000 HAD NONE OF 100 YEARS AND UPWARDS WHEN THE LONDON BILLS AFFORD ABOUT 8 IN A YEAR AND UPON THE WHOLE OF 750222 BURIALS IN THE SAID 30 YEARS HAVE 242 OF THAT AGE OR WHO CAN GIVE A REASON IF THEY HAD SUCH WHY THEY CONSTRUCTED THEIR TABLES ON SO SMALL A BASIS AS WHOLLY TO EXCLUDE THEM IT MAY BE SAID THE 242 PERSONS DYING ABOVE 100 YEARS OF AGE DID NOT ARISE FROM 750222 BIRTHS IN TOWN BUT FROM A GREAT MANY MORE BROUGHT IN FROM 21 THESE MIGHT BE TRIED OR REGULATED BY PROPORTIONS FORMED FROM OTHER ACCOUNTS TAKING THE DEATHS BETWEEN 10 AND 20 OR THE MOST CERTAIN PERIOD IN EACH FOR THE TWO LEADING PROPORTIONALS AND TRYING ABOVE AND BELOW FOR LIVES AND DEATHS LESSER ACCOUNTS OF SINGLE PARISHES WILL NOT DO ALONE FOR AS AGED LIVES ARE RARE ONE IS FORGOTTEN BEFORE ANOTHER HAPPENS AND IN SMALL NUMBERS THEY ARE NOT TO BE EXPECTED THE63 THE COUNTRY AFTER 20 AND PROBABLY UPON THE WHOLE FROM DOUBLE THAT NUMBER OF BIRTHS I SHALL ONLY RE PLY LET THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS OR PERSONS NATIVES OR ALIENS BE WHAT IT WILL FROM WHICH THE 242 ARISE YET IN SOME DEFINITE NUMBER SUCH AND SO MANY IN STANCES OF LONGEVITY ARE FOUND OF WHICH THE PRESENT TABLES TAKE NO NOTICE AND THOUGH THE FACT IS MANI FEST ENOUGH YET THE ABSURDITY IN RESPECT TO PRACTICE AND FORMATION OF TABLES STILL CONTINUES IF WE LOOK BACK WE SHALL FIND THE FIRST SKETCH THAT OF CAPT JOHN 22 GRAUNT ALIAS SIR WILLIAM 23 PETTY WAS FORMED UPON 100 ONLY AND SUCH A TABLE CARRIED THE ACCOUNT TO THE 80TH YEAR OR UP WARDS NEXT WERE INTRODUCED THOSE OF 1000 AND EXTENDED THE COMPUTATION OF LIFE TO BETWEEN 84 AND 100 TABLES FORMED UPON 10000 WOULD ADVANCE TO ABOVE 105 AND UPON 100000 DULY PROPORTIONED FROM THE MATERIALS WE HAVE MIGHT CONTINUE THE AC COUNT TO 115 YEARS AND UPWARDS IF IN THE FIRST SKETCH THE SUPPOSED TERM OF LIFE WAS CLOSED TOO SOON AND IT WAS AN IMPROVEMENT TO CARRY ON AN ACCOUNT OF THE GRADUAL DECAY BEYOND THE 90TH YEAR WHY ARE WE TO REST HERE HAVING ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS MADE FOR MORE THAN 60 YEARS WHICH FURNISH MATERIALS FOR A FURTHER PROGRESS IF THERE IS ROOM AND GOOD FOUNDA TION TO ADVANCE BUT 20 YEARS BEYOND THE COMPASS OF THE PRESENT TABLES SHOULD NOT THIS BE DONE AND WILL IT NOT MAKE A CONSIDERABLE YET NECESSARY ALTERA TION IN ALL COMPUTED VALUES UPON ANNUITIES TO BE GRANTED TO PERSONS IN THE LATTER PART OF LIFE 22 GRAUNTS OBSERVATIONS 5TH EDIT P 84 23 PHIL TRANS

PROPORTIONS 24 BEGINNING WITH 1000 NOT BIRTHS BUT CHILDREN OF 6 MONTHS OLD OR UPWARDS 25 WHICH MAKES A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN RESPECT TO AGE GIVEN AND YEARLY DEATHS THROUGH THE WHOLE TABLE AND I ALMOST ENVY THOSE WHO HAVE THE DE SIRABLE USE OF CHOICE ORIGINALS THE ACCOUNTS OF DR NEWMAN ARE I SUPPOSE PRESERVED BY YOUR SOCIETY AND THERE IS A STATE OF THE EXCHEQUER ANNUITANTS 26 OFTEN MENTIONED BUT NOT PUBLISHED BY MR LEE NEVERTHELESS THESE LAST BEING OF DIVERS AGES IF THE PARTICULAR AGE OF EACH PERSON AT ENTRY AND DEATH BE NOT KNOWN THOUGH THE GROSS NUMBERS YEARLY DYING MAY AS IT WAS TOO GREAT A PRESUMPTION TO ASSERT THAT THEY BEGAN ALL AT THE BEST STAGE 27 OF LIFE AND WERE SO NICELY CHOSEN 28 THAT THE DURATION OF 35 YEARS WAS A THING EXTRAORDINARY SO IT WOULD BE A BLAMEABLE CREDULITY TO ADMIT THESE POINTS FOR TRUTHS WHEN WE CONTINUALLY SEE HOW MANY ARE RESOLVED TO CHUSE THEIR OWN LIVES OR THOSE OF THEIR CHILDREN OR FAVOURITES EVEN WHEN THEY ARE RECEDED 10 OR 20 YEARS FROM THAT

HAS COMPUTED THE SAME KIND OF LIFE AS EQUAL TO A TERM OF 35 YEARS NOT WITHSTANDING ALL THE ALLOWANCES PLEADED FOR IN HIS ESSAY 29 IN FULL CONSIDERATION OF WHICH HE WAS AFRAID OF OVERDOING THE MATTER AND YET IF HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN US THE TRUE RESULT OF THE LONDON BILLS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN STATE AND RECKONING WITH EXACTNESS WHICH HE CALLS TO THE EXTREMITY A LIFE OF 10 YEARS WOULD BE FOUND EQUAL TO A TERM OF 3494 YEARS BUT ONE OF 4 YEARS OLD EQUAL TO A TERM OF 3820 YEARS ABOVE 3 YEARS BETTER THAN HIS BEST LIFE I SHOULD NOT HAVE MENTIONED THIS BUT TO OBSERVE THAT IT IS NATURAL ENOUGH WHEN THE EXPECTED TERM OF LIFE IS TAKEN TO THE UTTERMOST TO MAKE SOME ALLOWANCE AND YET IF ALLOWANCE IS TO BE MADE IT SHOULD NOT BE BY AN ARBITRARY AND FALSE REPRESENTATION OF LIFE THROUGH OUT A WHOLE TABLE 30 BUT LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF PARTIES CONCERNED AND TO BE MADE IN PROPORTION TO 29 PAGE 231 30 MR LEE RIGHTLY CONCLUDING THAT THE DEGREE OF MORTALITY OUGHT TO INCREASE FROM THE YEAR OF GREATEST EXPECTATION TO THE END OF LIFE ERRONEOUSLY INFERRED FROM THENCE THAT THE DEDUCEND OR PART OF THE TERM OF LIFE WASTING IN EACH DECAD SHOULD BE LEAST AT FIRST AND GREATER AFTERWARDS AND SO APPORTIONED

SUCH TABLE AND THAT IN GENERAL ABOUT 110 OF THE TERM DEDUCTED IN ANY PART OF LIFE WOULD NOT BE UNREASONABLE WHEN THE ACCOUNT IS CARRIED ON TO THE FULL EXTENT OF HUMAN LIFE ESPECIALLY IF SUCH SUPPOSED DURATION IS TAKEN AS A RULE FOR PRICE FOR REASONS WELL KNOWN TO YOU BY COMPARING THE RESPECTIVE 31 VALUE OF PRESENT AND FUTURE YEARS AT ANY RATE OF INTEREST 32 AND OBSERVING THAT A GAIN OF TIME IN THE LATTER WOULD NOT BE EQUAL IN VALUE TO THE LOSS OF LIKE TIME IN THE FORMER AFTER MANY DEGRADING COMPARISONS ABOVEMEN TIONED TO THE DISHONOUR OF OUR CAPITAL IT MAY COUN TERBALLANCE THEM TO HEAR WHAT

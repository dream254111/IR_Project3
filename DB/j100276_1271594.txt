court in the principal case held that the plaintiff could not recover for the twentyfour hours delay on Sunday There is no exception mentioned in the statute but as railroads cannot be compelled to run trains on Sunday the court said the statute should be read with this in mind It intimated that if it could not read this exception into the statute it would hold the law unconstitutional General terms should be so construed as not to lead to injustice oppression or an absurd consequence If this would be the result courts will presume that the legislature intended exceptions to be embodied in the statute U S v Kirby 7 Wall 486 Allen v Texas  Pacific R R Co Ioo Tex 525 IOI S W 792 supra Nearly all writers and courts favor the idea that statutes should be read according to the intention of

corporations The constitution of Alabama 1875 guaranteed and extended to all persons alike the privilege to sue and be sued in any and all courts This provision Art 14  I2 of the I875 constitution now  240 of the 1901 constitution was construed by the Supreme Court of Alabama in South  North R Co v Morris 65 Ala I99 and Smith v   N R Co 75 Ala 45I In the latter the court after citing County of San Mateo v S P R R Co C C 8 Sawy 238 13 Fed 722 to the effect that  I of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to corporations as well as natural persons held That the sum of these provisions is that no burden can be imposed upon one class of persons natural or artificial that is not in like conditions imposed upon all other classes When a constitutional provision has been construed and is afterwards incorporated into a new and revised constitution it must be presumed to retain the same construction and to have been em bodied with this construction into the new constitution Ex parte Roundtree 5i Ala 42 Therefore the  240 of constitution of 19go must receive the same construction as Art 14  I2 of the constitution of 1875 and that constitution prohibits the exercise of the right of expulsion or forfeiture Likewise does the constitution of the United States prohibit its enforcement For no act of the state is lawful which will impair the validity of a contract it has authorized or deprive a foreign corporation of property without due process of law or deny to it the equal protection of the laws See 6 MICH LAW REV 587 588 5 Id 58 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWPOLCE POWERPERSONAL LIBERTYPHOTOGRAPH ING

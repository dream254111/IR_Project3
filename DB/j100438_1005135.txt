SCIENCE OF LANGUAGES HAS MADE WITHIN THE LAST THIRTV YEARS IS NOT AMONG THE LEAST IMPORTANT OF THE MANY WONDERS WTICH THE PIRESENT AGE HAS PRODUCED THLE FIRST STRONG IMPULSE WAS GIVEN TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY BY THE PUB LICATION OF THE COMPARATIVE VOCABULARY COMPILED BY PRO FESSOR PALLAS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE ENMPRESS CATHARINE OF RUSSIA A WORK INDEED BETTER CONCEIVED THAN EXECUTED BUT WHICHI NEVERTHELESS HAS BEEN AND STILL IS OF GREAT USE TO THE LEAR NED IN THE PROSECUTION OF PHILOLOGICAL STUIDIES THIS WORK WHICHI WAS LEFT INCOMPLETE BEING CONFINED TO THE LAN GUAGES OF

OF TLHE ORIGIN OF THE TRIBES AND NATIONS OF AMNERICA THE OBJECT OF THE LEARNED AU TTOR AT FIRST WAS TO SUPLPLY THE DEFICIENCY OF THE GREAT PHI LOLOGICAL MNONUMENT WHICH THE EMRNPRESS CATHARINE HAD BEGUN AS FAR AS RELATED TO THE LANGUAGES OF AMNERICA HAPPY WOUILD IT HAVE BEEN IF LHE HAD NOT SUFFERED LHIS ITMAGINATION TO DRAW HIMN AWAY FROM THAT SIMPLE BUT HIGHLY USEFUL DESIGN  BUT HE CONCEIVED THAT BY COMNPARING THE AMERICAN WITH THLE ASIATIC LANGUAGES HE COULD PROVE THE ORIGRIN OF OUR INDIANS FIOM TLHE ATIONS WHICH INHABIT THE OPPOSITE COAST OF ASIA AND THUS HE SACRIFICED THE REAL ADVANTAGE OF SCIENCE TO THE PURSUIT OF A FAVOURITE THEORY HE HIAS NEVERTHELESS BROUGLHT TOGETHER IN A COMPARATIVE VIEW FIFTYTWO SELECT WORDS IN ABOUT TLHIRTY OR FORTY OF OUR ABORIGINAL IDTIOMS BY WHICH HE LHAS SHEWN THAT HE MIGHT IF HE PLEASED HAVE COMPLETED PROFESSOR PALLASS VOCABLULARY AS FAR AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE AT THAT PERIOD WHEN WE HAD NOT THE MEANS THAT HAVE BEEN OBTAINED SINCE HIS WAS THE FIRST ATTENMPT TO COLLECT AND COMPARE TO SOME EXTENT SPECIMENS OF OUR INDIAN LAN LAS HAD GIVEN THE CORRESPONDING TERMS IN THE AFRICAN AND AMERICAN LAN GUAGES BUT M JANKIEWITSCH TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO ALTER THE WHOLE PLAN OF PALLASS WORK AND INSTEAD OF PURSUING THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM WHICH WAS TO GIVE THE SAME RUSSIAN WORD IN THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN DUE SUCCES SION HE MADE AN ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUE OF EXOTIC WORDS WHICH HE EX PLAINED INTO RUSSIAN AND IN WHICH HE MIXED ALL NATIONS AND LANGUAGES TOGETHER WITH A VIEW TO SHEW HOW THE SAME SOUNDS RECEIVED DIFFERENT MEANINGS IN DIFFERENT IDIOMS THE EMPRESS WAS DISPLEASED AND THE EDITION WAS SUPPRESSED A FEW COPIES HOWEVER HAVE GONE ABROAD ONE OF WHICH IS IN THE LIBRARY OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY M JANKIEWITCH DID WRONG IN NOT FOLLOWING THE PLAN OF HIS PREDECESSOR WHOSE WORK HE THUS LEFT INCOMPLETE WHEN ITS COMPLETION WAS THE VERY OBJECT WHICH WAS ENTRUSTED TO HIS CARE HE SHOULD FIRST HAVE EXECUTED HIS TASK HE MIGHT AFTERWARDS HAVE PUIBLISHED A VOCABULARY ON HIS OWN SYS TEM WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A USEFUL COUNTERPART TO THE OTHER INDEED THESE TWO PARTS SEEM ESSENTIAL TO A GOOD COMPARATIVE VOCABULARY PRE CISELY AS IN A DICTIONARY OF TWO LANGUAGES THERE MUST BE A PART BEGINNING WITH EACH AND EXPLAINING THE WORDS OF EACH INTO THE OTHER  RELANDUS IN THE THIRD VOLUME OF HIS DISSERTATIONS PUBLISHED VOCA

FORTY YEARS AS A MISSIONARY ANMONG THE DELAWARE INDIANS NOT ONLY WITH IGNORANICE OF THEIR LANGUAGE BUT WITH FABRICATING DELAWARE WORDS IN ORDER TO SUIT A PAR TICULAR PURPOSE THIS IS CARRYING TOO FAR THE MAXIM NUL IIUS IN VERBA AND THE REVIEWER WHO VENTURES SO MUCH OUGLHT FIRST TO HAVE CONVINCED HIS READERS THAT HE WAS IIMNSELF PER FECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE DELAWARE LANGRUAGE WHILE ON THE

AMSONG THE INIDIANS ON WHOSE LANGUAGES THEY WROTE WHILE THE ANO NYMOUS REVIEWER DOES NOT TELL US THAT HE EVER RESIDED WITH ANY OF THEM IF HE DERIVED HIS INFORMATION FROM IN DIAN TRADERS AND INTERPRETERS HE IS NOT PROBABLY AWARE THAT THEY ARE TIOT THE PROPER SOURCES FROM WHICH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GRAMMINAR OF THOSE LANGUAGES IS TO BE OBTAINED THEY DO NOT PRETEND TO BE RMEN OF SCIENCE AND IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THIAT EVEN INIDIANS WHO ARE MUCH IN THE HABIT OF CONVERS ITLG WITH WHITE MEN WILL ADAPT THEIR FORMS AS MUCH AS POS SIBLE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR OWN LATNGUAGE EXPECTING THEREBY TO BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD IT IS THUS THAT WE OFTEN SPEAK BROKEN ENGLISH WHEN ADDRESSING FOREIGNERS AND THAT NURSES WILL LISP WHIEN SPEAKING TO CHILDREN BUT IT IS NOT SO THAT INDIAN ORATORS

ANALYZED SO AS TO LAY DOWN THIEIR RULES WHEN DIFFERING FROM OULR OWN WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE PERSPICUITY IT WERE TO BE WISTHED THAT OUR AUTTHOR HAD DEVOTED A CHAPTER TO THE SYNTAX AND PHRASCOLOGY

THAT THERE SHOULDL BE A UNIFORM MODE OF WRITING EXOTIC WORDS IN ORDER TO CONVEY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SAME IDEA OF THEIR SOUNDS AT LEAST TO THE LEARNED THROUGH THE CIVILIZED WORLD BUT INIDEPEND ENT OF THE NUMEROUS DIFFICULTIES WHICHI NATURALLY ATTEND SUCH A DESIGN FIROM THIE ALMOST ENTIRE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONVEYING TO THE MIND THROUGH THE EYE THE IDEA OF SOUNDS WHICH THE EAR NEVER HEARD AN ILL

CHARACTER BEING UNIVER SALLY USED THE CELEBRATED VOLNEY WISHIED ALL THE ORIENTAL  THE TRANSLATOR HAS PRESERVED THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF THE ORIGINAL EXCEPT THAT HE HAS SUBSTITUTED THE LETTER Y FOR THE GERMAN J BECAUSE Y HAS THE SAME SOUND ACCORDING TO THE ENGLISH AND GERMAN PRONUNCIATION ALSO WHERE THE AUTHOR HAS INTRODUCED THE VOWEL O AFTER W IN ORDER TO SHEW THAT THE LATTER IS TO HAVE THE ENGLISH AND NOT THE GERMAN SOUND AND SO WRITES WOAGAN TO BE PRONOUNCED WAGAN THE TRANSLATOR HAS SUPPRESSED THE O THINKING IT SUFFICIENT TO GIVE NOTICE THAT W CONSONANT IS ALWAYS TO BE PRONOUNCED AS IN ENGLISH WHETHER IT BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER CONSO NANT OR BY A VOWEL IN THE FORMER CASE A SHEVA OR MUTE VOWEL IS INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE TWO SOUNDS THUS WDANIS DAUGHTER IS PRONOUNCED WDANIS AND NOT OODANIS FOLLOWING THE SAME PRINCIPLE WHERE THE AUTHOR WRITES WIQUOAM A HOUSE THE TRANSLATOR WRITES WIKWAM WHICH IS PRECISELY THE SOUND WHICH ZEISBERGER MEANT TO REPRESENT VOL IIIZ90 GRAMMAR OF THE LANGUAGE

MEANS OF CARRYING IT INTO EXECUTION THIS SHEWS HOW FAR A FAVOURITE IDEA NMAV TAKE HOLD OF THE MIND OF A MAN HOWEVER DISTINGUISHED BY HIS GENIUS AND TALENTS IT IS NIOT FOR THOSE LANGUAGES THAT HAVE ALREADY AN ALPHABET AND AN ORTHOGRAPHY OF THEIR OWN THAT A UNIFORM NMODE OF WRITING THEIR WORDS IS DESIRABLE UNIFORMITY IN THIS RESPECT EVEN ANMONG THE NATIONS THAT USE THE SAME CHARACTERS IS AB SOLUTELY UNATTAINABLE ALL THAT IS DESIRED IS A COMMON MODE OF COMMUNICATING THE SOUNDS OF UNWRITTEN LANGUAGES IN OR DER TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF THIEIR WORDS AND GRAMMA TICAL FORMS WITH EACH OTLHER WITH THE GREATER EXACTNESS TO THIS OBJECT THE POWERS OF OUR ENGLISH ALPTHABET ARE NOT ADE QUATE BECAUSE ITS VOWEL SOUNDS ARE UNCERTAIN AND A GREAT PART OF THEM ARE REPRESENTED BY CLIPHTLHONIGS BUT MOST NATIONS SEEM TO THINK THAT THEIR NATIONAL HONOUR IS CONCERNED IN FORCING THEIR OWN ORTHOGRAPHY UPON THE LEARNED WORLD THUS SINCE THE STUDY OF THE CLHINESE LANGUAGE HAS BECOMNE FASHIONABLE IN EUROPE THE PORTUGUESE MODE OF SPELLING CHI NESE WORDS TO WLHICH ALL WERE BEFORE ACCUSTOMED HLAS BEEN ENTIRELY ABANDONED AND THE ENGLISH AND FRENCLH HAVE EACH ADOPTED THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF THEIR OWN

THEREFORE MY LEARNED FIIEND MR PICKERINIG WITH THE LIBERALITV WLHICH CHARACTERIZES AN AMERICAN MAN OF SCIENCE HAS PROPOSED A UNIFOI RM MODE OF WRITING THE WORDS OF OUR INDIAN LANGUAGES WHICH I AM

DAZZLE FOR A WHILE BUT SIMPLICITY IN PLANS PRESENTED FOR GENERAL92 GRAMMAR OF THE LANGUAGE PRACTICE IS THE MNARK OF TRUE GENIUS AND MUIST ULTIMATELY PRE VAIL BEFORE I CONCLUDE THIS PREFACE I BEG LEAVE TO SAY A FEW WORDS RESPECTING THE PRESENT TRANSLATION WHEN ELEVEN YEARS AGO I UNDERTOOK TO MAKE IT FOR THE PHILOSOPHICAL SO CIETY I HAD NEVER TURNED MLY ATTENTION TO THE INDIAN LAN GUAGES AND I WAS ENTITELY IGNORANIT OF THEIR FORMS AND CON STRUCTION I TLHEREFORE TLHOUGHT OF NOTHING BEYONID A CLOSE AND LITERAL TRANSLATION OF THE MANUSCRIPT I SOON PER CEIVED HIOWEVER THAT IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN ON LOOSE SHIEETS WHICH HAD BEEN BOUND TOGETHER AFTER THE AUTHORS DEATH BY PERSONS NOT CONVERSANT WITLH THE SUBJECT IT ALSO BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT MR ZEISBERGER HAD NOT GIVEN THE LAST FINIISH INYG HAND TO HIS WORK HE PROBABLY MNEANT TO HIAVE CON DENSED IT AND TO HAVE EXHIBITED THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE CONJUGATIONS OF THE VERBS IN A LESSER NUMBER OF PARADIGMNS THESE OBSERVATIONS STRUCK ME AS I WENT ON WITH THE TRANSLA TION WLHICH I FINISHED AS I HAD BEGUN IT I LEFT OUT ONLY ONE CHAPTER IN WHICH THE AUTHOR EXPLAINED THE MIIANNER OF EX PRESSING THE GERMANI COMPOTUND VERBS INTO THE DELAWARE LANGUAGE AS IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED TOO MUCH LABOUR TO ADAPT IT TO THE ENGLISH FORMS OF SPEECH AND WOULD HAVE PARTICIPA TED IN TOO GREAT A DEGREE OF AN ORIGINAL COMPOSITION I REGRET HOWEVER THAT I DID NOT ATTEMPT IT IT IS NOW TOO LATE AS MR ZEISBERGERS MANUSCRIPT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE BETHLEHEM LIBRARY I HAD NO IDEA AT THE TIME THAT THIS GRAMMAR WOULD EVER BE PUBLISHED SINCE THLE SOCIETY CANME TO A RESOLUTION TO CONMRNIT IT TO THE PRESS IT BECARNE MY DTUTY TO REVISE WHAT I HAD DONE I SAW THAT IT WOULD R EQUIRE TO BE ALMOST ENTIRELY RECAST AND ABOVE ALL TO BE CONSIDERABLY AHRIDGED IN ORDER TO GIVE IT THAT FORM WLHICH ALOTNE COULD SATISFY THE TASTE OF THE PRESENT AGE BUT ON THIS I COULD NOT VENTURE FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS INDEED I HAVE APPLIED MNYSELF TO THE STUDY OF THIE INIDIAN LATNGUAGES AND HAVE BECOME NMORE CONVERSANT WITH THEIR STRUCTURE AND FIORMS THAN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT PAID A SINLILAR ATTENITION TO THE SUBJECT BESIDES THE USUAL HELPSOF THE LENN LENAPE INDIANS 93 OF

FORMN TO THE PUBLIC WITHOTUT SUCH AID I COUILD NOT UNDERTAKE IT BEING IN WANT OF THAT PRACTICAL KNOW LEDGE WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACQUIRED BY A LONG RESIDENCE ATTIONG THE INDIANS ANOTHER REASON HIAS INDUCED NME NOT TO MAKE TOO FREE WITH THIS GRAMMAR ALTHOUGH I AM SATISFIED THAT IT NMIGHT HAVE BEEN ADVANTAGEOUSLY ABRIDGED SEVERAL GENTLEMEN IAR TICULARLY OF THE ARMY WHO ARE STATIONED OR RESIDE IN THE VICINIITY OF THE INDIAN COUNTRY AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH THE ABORIGINES HAVE EXPRESSED A WISHL THAT MR ZEISBERGERS WORK SHOULD BE GIVEN IN AS AMPLE A FORM AS POSSIBLE AS IT WOULD HE OF GREAT USE TO THEM IN STUDYING NOT OTNLY THE LANGUAGE OF THE DELAWARES BUT ALSO THOSE OF THE CHIPPEWAYS MENOMONIES AND OTHER COGNATE IDIOMS TLHEREFORE IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED THAT IT IS NOT ONLY INTENLED AS AN EXHIBITION OF THE FORMS OF THE INDIAN DIALECTS IN A SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW BUT ALSO AS A GUIDE TO THOSE WHO MAV BE ENGAGED IN THE STULY OF THIS LANGUAGE TI O THERN THE MULTIPLICITY OF EXAMPLES WHICH OTHERS MAY THINK UNNE CESSARY WILL BE OF GREAT VALUE AS THERE ARE NO OTHER WRIT TEN SOTURCES FROM WHIICH THEY CAN DERIVE INFORMATIONI IF WE EXCEPT MR ZEISBERGERS SPELLING BOOK WHICH LHAS LONG BEEN OUT OF PRINT AND HIS TRANSLATION OF LIEBERKUHNS HARMONY OF THIE GOSPELS WHICH WAS PRINTED ONLY FOR THE USE OF MIS SIONARIES ANDL IS NOT TO BE PURCHIASED NEITHER IS THLE TRANS LAT ION OF ST JOHNS EPISTLE BY DENCKE TO BE LHAD IN THE SHOPS IT IS MUCH TO BE REGRETTED TTHAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF COPIES VOL 1112 A94 GRAMMAR OF THE LANGUAGE OF SUCH WORKS ARE NOT PUT IN

MANUSCRIPT NOW PUBLISHED I HAVE LOWEVER SOME TIMES VARIED FIONM THE AUTTIORS METHOD WHEN I THOUGHIT IT TOO DEFECTIVE ATID I LHAVE NMODIFIED HIS EXPLANATIONS SO AS TO GIVE THEM AS I THOUGHT A GREATER

NOT CLASSED UNDER THEIR DIFFERENT CONJUGATIONS BUT MOSTLY BELONG ING TO THE FIRST IN THE TRANSLATION WHICH I MADE FOR THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY I INSERTED THERM UN DER THE HEAD OF ADDITIONAL VERBS ON EXAMINING THENM AFTERWARDS MORE CLOSELY I FOUND SEVERAL WERE DEFICIENT IN MOODS AND TENSES AND WERE CLEARLY CONSIDERED BY THE AUTHOR ONLY AS MATERIALS TO BE MADE USE OF IN A REVISION OF HIS WORK AMONG THEM WERE REPETITIONS OF VERBS ALREADY GIVEN BUT IN SOME RESPECTS MORE COMPLETE CONTAINING MNOODS AND TENSES WHICH IN THE FIRST EXAMPLES WERE WANTING IT WILL BE SEEN IN THE VERBS PARTICULARLY OF THE FIRST CONJUGATION THAT THEY ARE NOT ALL CARRIED THROUGH THEIR DIFFERENT VOICES FORMS MOODS AND TENSES SO THAT ONE OFTEN SUPPLIES THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE OTHERS IF THE AUTHOR HAD LIVED IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIS WORK TO A GREATER DEGREE OF PERFECTION THIS I COULD NOT UNDERTAKE TO DO BUT I THOUGHT IT UNNE CESSARY TO SWELL THIS GRAMMAR WITH THESE ADDITIONAL VERBS AND FRAGMENTS OF

OF WRITING ITS FORMS ARE RICH REGULAR AND METHODICAL CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE ANALOGY OF THE IDEAS WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED TO EXPRESS COMPOUNDED BUT NOT CONFUSED OCCASIONALLY ELLIP TICAL IN THEIR MODE OF EXPRESSION BUT NOT MORE SO THAN THE LANGUAGES OF EUROPE AND MUCH LESS SO THAN THOSE OF A LARGE GROUP OF NATIONS ON THE EASTERN COAST OF ASIA I MEAN THE CHINESE AND THOSE WHICH POSSESS ANALOGOUS IDIOMS THE TERMINATIONS OF THEIR VERBS EXPRESSIVE OF NUM BER PERSON TIME AND OTHER MODIFICATIONS OF ACTION AND PASSION WHILE THEY ARE RICHER IN THEIR EXTENSION THAN THOSE OF THE LATIN AND THE GREEK WHICH WE CALL EMPHATICALLY THE LEARNED LANGUAGES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN FORMED ON A SIMILAR BUT ENLARGED MODEL WITHOUT ANY AID THAN THAT WHICH WAS AFFORDED BY NATURE OPERATING UPON THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES OF MAN TO WHAT CAUSE ARE THESE PHENOMENA TO BE ATTRIBUTED  1 HOPE I SHALL BE EXCUSED FOR SAYING THAT THIS QUESTION WHICH I THINK OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE AS IT LEADS IMMEDIATELY TO THAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE VARIETY OF HUMAN LANGUAGES AND PERHAPS OF LANGUAGE ITSELF HAS NOT RECEIVED EITHER IN AMERICA OR EUROPE ALL THE ATTENTION THAT IT DE SERVES IN EUROPE AN IDEA APPEARS GENERALLY TO PREVAIL THAT THE GRAM MATICAL FORMS OF LANGUAGES HAVE PROCEEDED IF NOT ENTIRELY AT LEAST IN A VERY GREAT DEGREE FROM THE OPERATION OR INFLUENCE OF THE ART OF WRITING WHICH IS SAYING IN OTHER WORDS THAT THESE FORMS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED OR ESSENTIALLY MODIFIED BY THE ARTS OF CIVILIZATION A CELEBRATED FRENCH PHILOLOGIST TO WHOSE VARIED TALENTS AND EXTENSIVE ACQUIREMENTS NO MAN PAYS A MORE WILLING HOMAGE THAN MYSELF M ABEL REMUSAT EXPRESSESOF THE LENNI LENAPE INDIANS 249 CONCLUDING NOTE HIMSELF THUS ON THIS SUBJECT  I DO NOT ONLY SPEAK OF THOSE FORMS THE OBJECT OF WHICH IS TO POINT OUT THE RELATIONS OF WORDS AND THE MECHANISM OF WHICH SIMPLE OR COMPLICATED INGENIOUS OR CONFUSED ATTESTS THE MORE OR LESS SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS OF THE WRITERS WHO FIRST GAVE LAWS TO LANGUAGE THIS LEARNED AUTHOR WHOSE EXQUISITE SENSE AND SOUND JUDGMENT LEAVE NO ROOMN TO SUPPOSE THAT IT EVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HIS PROPOSITION MIGHT BE CONITRADICTED APPEARS EVIDENTLY TO HAVE CONSIDERED IT AS ONE OF THOSE PHILOLOGICAL AXIOMS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO LONG AND SO UNIVERSALLY ESTAB LISHED THAT NO ONE EVEN THINKS OF CALLING THEM IN QUESTION AND SO IT HAS APPEARED TO MANY OTHER EUROPEAN WRITERS AND IT SEEMS IN FACT TO BE AN OPINION GENERALLY RECEIVED IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD I MUST OWN THAT TO ME IT SEEMS INCONSISTENT WITH THE FACTS WHICH THIS GRAMMAR EXHIBITS AND WHICH ALL POINT TO NATURE AND NOT TO ART AS THE SOURCE FROM WHENCE HAVE PROCEEDED THE VARIOUS GRAMMATICAL FORMS OF THE LANGUAGES OF MEN I HAVE NOT ROOM TO DEVELOP HERE THIS CONCLUSION MORE THAN I HAVE DONE INCIDENTALLY IN THE PREFACE I HAVE THOUGHT IT RIGHT HOWEVER TO POINT IT OUT SPECIFICALLY AS THE PRINCIPAL RESULT WHICH IN MY OPINION THE PUBLICA TION OF THIS GRAMMAR WILL PRODUCE IT APPEARS TO ME THAT AFTER A CARE FUL READING OF THE WORK AND A COMPARISON OF THIS LANGUAGE WITH THOSE OF CIVILIZED NATIONS THE MIND MUST BE NECESSARILY DRAWN TO THE FOLLOWING INFERENCES 1 THAT THE GRAMMATICAL FORMS OF A LANGUAGE CONSTITUTE WHAT MAY BE CALLED ITS ORGANIZATION 2 THAT THIS ORGANIZATION IS THE WORK OF NATURE AND NOT OF CIVILIZATION OR ITS ARTS 3 THAT THE ARTS OF CIVILIZATION MAY CULTIVATE AND BY THAT MEANS POLISH A LANGUAGE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BUT CAN NO MORE ALTER ITS ORGANIZATION THAN THE ART OF THE GARDENER CAN CHANGE THAT OF AN ONION OR A POTATO 4 THAT THE CONTRARY OPINION IS THE RESULT OF THE PRIDE OF CIVILIZED MEN A PASSION INHERENT IN OUR NATURE AND THE GREATEST OBSTACLE THAT EXISTS TO THE INVESTIGATION OF TRUTH IN THUS EXPRESSING MY OPINION WITH ALL THE CLEARNESS AND PRECISION THAT I AM CAPABLE OF I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS INTEND TO ESTABLISH THESE PROPOSITIONS AS AXIOMS BUT MERELY TO SUBMIT THEM AS QUESTIONS TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE LEARNED IF THEY SHALL BE THOUGHT WORTHY OF THE ATTEN TION TO WHICH IT APPEARS THAT THE SUBJECT ENTITLES THEM THAT NEW FACTS OR FACTS ALREADY KNOWN IN PART BUT NOW MORE CLEARLY MADE APPARENT SHOULD PRODUCE NEW OPINIONS IS WHAT MAY NATURALLY BE EXPECTED AND HE WILL BE I HOPE ACQUITTED OF

AFRAID THE PART OF NA TURE WILL BE FOUND TO BE THE LIONS SHARE IF IT BE TRUE THAT THE POEMS ATTRIBUTED TO HOMER WERE COMPOSED AT A TIME WHEN THE GREEKS WERE IGNORANT OF THE ART OF WRITING WE HAVE THE TRUE MEASURE OF NATURES SHARE IN THE FORMATION OF THIS BEAUTIFIIL LANGUAGE THE ROMANS WHO COULD WRITE DID NOT PROVE BY THEIR IDIOM THE SUPERIORITY OF ART MANY OBSERVATIONS ARISING FROM THE DETAILS OF

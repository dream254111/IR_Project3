science of languages has made within the last thirtv years is not among the least important of the many wonders wtich the piresent age has produced Thle first strong impulse was given towards the close of the last century by the pub lication of the Comparative Vocabulary compiled by pro fessor Pallas under the direction of the enmpress Catharine of Russia a work indeed better conceived than executed but whichi nevertheless has been and still is of great use to the lear ned in the prosecution of philological stuidies This work whichi was left incomplete being confined to the lan guages of

of tlhe Origin of the Tribes and Nations of Amnerica The object of the learned au ttor at first was to suplply the deficiency of the great phi lological mnonument which the emrnpress Catharine had begun as far as related to the languages of Amnerica Happy wouild it have been if lhe had not suffered lhis itmagination to draw himn away from that simple but highly useful design  But he conceived that by comnparing the American with thle Asiatic languages he could prove the origrin of our Indians fiom tlhe ations which inhabit the opposite coast of Asia and thus he sacrificed the real advantage of science to the pursuit of a favourite theory He hias nevertheless brouglht together in a comparative view fiftytwo select words in about tlhirty or forty of our aboriginal idtioms by which he lhas shewn that he might if he pleased have completed professor Pallass VocabLulary as far as it could have been done at that period when we had not the means that have been obtained since His was the first attenmpt to collect and compare to some extent specimens of our Indian lan las had given the corresponding terms in the African and American lan guages But M Jankiewitsch took upon himself to alter the whole plan of Pallass work and instead of pursuing the original system which was to give the same Russian word in the different languages in due succes sion he made an alphabetical catalogue of exotic words which he ex plained into Russian and in which he mixed all nations and languages together with a view to shew how the same sounds received different meanings in different idioms The empress was displeased and the edition was suppressed A few copies however have gone abroad one of which is in the library of the American Philosophical Society M Jankiewitch did wrong in not following the plan of his predecessor whose work he thus left incomplete when its completion was the very object which was entrusted to his care He should first have executed his task he might afterwards have puiblished a vocabulary on his own sys tem which would have been a useful counterpart to the other Indeed these two parts seem essential to a good comparative vocabulary pre

Chinese dialects Thus learned and industrious men are collecting in all parts of the world the valuable mnaterials out of whichi is to be erected the splendid edifice of Universal Philology Various attempts have been made to reduce this science into a body of doctrine but none has completely succeeded because the facts on whiichi it rests have not yet been sufficiently ascertained Ininumerable works have been written on the origin of language while the greatest numnber of the idioms of the earth were entirely unknown Theories have been accumnulated instead of facts every one of whicih had

left out of their edition all that relates to the Cochin Chinese language Thus in our Americati edition of Barrows Travels in China the specimens of Tartar characters have been omitted because the

contributed to the ad vancement of knowledge Among those we must place in the first rank the illustrious president De Brosses whose excellent treatise on the mechanical formnation of language contains nmore correct reasoning tthan any other work on the same subject Nor can I pass over in silence the lighlts that are diffused throtugh the Elements of Ideo logy of our venerated associate Destutt tracyt so fruit ful of important principles thiat still remain to be applied to various unsettled points of our science But with these helps and many others that could be mentioned we are not yet prepared for a general elenmenitary treatise on phli lology taken in its whole extent more facts are yet to be collected and inveterate theories submitted to the test of truth before this great work can be undertaken with hopes of success Philology in fact in the sense in whiich I wish to be understood is of imnmense extent It not onlv embraces oral language in all its varieties but also writing and all the signs by means of wlhich ideas are communicated tlhrough the organs of sight The language of signs which the deat and dunmb make use of is alone a science But settitng these aside and conifining ourselves to speech pro perly so called we find in that alonie a boundless field of inquiry We are arrested in the outsetaby the unnumberted languages and dialects which are spread over the

possible by visible signs ETYMOLOGY or the knowledcre of those constituent parts of language that we call words by means of which we are enabled to trace the affinities of the different idioms of the earth and the filiation of the numerous races and tanmi lies of men who inlhabit it and lastly IDEOLOGY or the com parative study of tlle rranimatical formns and idiomatic con struction of languages by which we are tautrht to analyze and distinguislh the different shapes in wlich ideas cotnbine themselves in order to fix perceptions in our mninds and transmit them to those of others whiile we observe with wonder the effects of that tendency to order and mnethlod and that natural logic which God hlas implanted in the rmiind of every man A considerable time mtust elapse before we shall have collected a sufficiency of facts to enalle us to genieralize to a certaini extent our ideas on these various sutbjects the attempting of which too soon lhas hitherto been the great error of philologists It is astonislhing to see what efforts lhave been rmale by imen of superior as well as tthose of inferior talents to discover thie origin of lhutnan speech to trace an origrinal or primitive language in those wlhicl now exist to invent a universal or lphilosoplical idliom a Unli versal grammar a uniiversal alphabet and so many other universals while the particulars are yet to be learned  I have treated of this subject separately merely in its application to the English language in the first volume of the present series of these Transactions p 228 A reference to that essay will shew the immense extent of this branch of the philological science76 GRAMMAR OF THE LANGUAGE When we find such men as Court de Gehelin Bishop Wilkins Maupertuis Rousseau Adam Smitli and so mnany othlers seri ously emiployedi itn the pursuit of those unattainable objects we can but lamilent the disposition of thle human minid to transgress the bounids which Eternal Wisdomi hias prescribed to lhuman knowledge and human power If philology had no othler object than to promote and fa cilitate the intercotirse betweetn nations and make men better acquainted withi the globe they inhabit it would be well worthi all thie trouble and labour that may be bestowed upon it Wliat further results it may produce useful or interesting to mankind it is impossible to foretel Thus nmuclh is certain that no science more powerfully excites that desire of knowledge which is inherent in our nature and which no doubt was given to us by the Alrniglhty for wise purposes Moved by these considerations the American Plhilosophi cal Society have thouglht it incumbent upon them to add to the mass of facts wlich arte accunmuilating on all sides by the publication of this grammar While thie languages of Asia occupy the attention of the philologists of Europe liglt is expected fronm this quarter to be shied on those of our own continent This Society was the first to discover and make known to the

in the point of view of their capa city to aid the development of ideas rhat such prejudices should exist among men who have deservedly acquired an emninent reputation for science is mutch to be regretted and it is particularly with a view to remove themn from the minids of such men that this gramnmiiar is published The learned baron will I hope recognize in the conjugations of the Del aware

of thieir ideas and the formation of their words But it is not in Europe alone that we find persons dispo sed to disparage every tling that belongs to the A merican Indians The samse spirit prevails I atn sorry to say in a much higher degree anmong many in this country particu larly those who inhabit our frontier settlemnents where causes of difference too often arise between the two races This feeling when once entertained knows tio bounds and men in other respects gifted with judgment and talents feel its influence unperceived I have been led into this observa tion by a well written and otherwise interesting article on the Indians and their languages which appeared in the North American Review for January 1826 thie anonymous author  Ueber das Entstehen der grammatischen Formen und ihren Einfluss auf die Ideen Entwicklung Von Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt Pub lished in the Transactions of the Berlin Academy of Sciences for the year 1822 Historical and Philological Class p 401OF THE LENNI LENAPE INDIANS 79 of which labours hard to depreciate the unfortunate Indians and make them appear the rnost stupid as well as the most barbarous race of nmen and their languages of course as cor responding with that degraded clharacter It is a matter of regret that this writer should have been carried so far away byhis prejudices as to charge the venerable Heckewelder wlho resided nearly forty years as a missionary anmong the Delaware Indians not only with ignoranice of their language but with fabricating Delaware words in order to suit a par ticular purpose This is carrying too far the maxim nul Iius in verba and the reviewer who ventures so much ouglht first to have convinced his readers that he was Iimnself per fectly acquainted with the Delaware langruage while on the contrary after nmentioning a few of Mr Heckewelders sub stantives the sounds of which it seenis are not pleasing to his ears he exclaims in disguist Pronounce these who can we eschew the task This strong expression of an un pleasant feeling is not natural to one who is conversant with a particular idiom such a one besides mtust be pre sumed to be in some degree familiar with its sounds and to be able at least to articulate them The reviewer that I speak of pays no greater respect to Mr Zeisberger the author of this grammar If he does niot expressly charge himn with forgery he at least tries to make it appear that he did not know the language on wlhich he wrote In this grammar in thle conjuLgation of the causative form of the verb wulamallsin to be happy will be found thie

 This word elumiangellatschik has been evidently formed to meet the case and formed on erroneous principles N A Review p 7680 GRAMMAR OF THE LAN GUAGE Among other reasons equally unsatisfactory he

used as substantives rhus the Latin participle arnans inay be translated lhe who loves ille qui amnat and yet not a trace of the pronoun qui is found in it In the Englisth language the participle present is not generally employed in a substantive sense therefore the word loving can not be translated by he who loves but the meaning of the nouii substantive lover may be thuis renidered and the participle past beloved is often used in tthat sense as the beloved he who is be loved the pronoun who being understood But the reviewer goes farther and pretends that there is no word in any In dian

nmav be conmprehended when it cannot be separately expressed These specimens are suffi cient to give an idea of the reviewers course of reasoning nor do the limits of this preface allow me to pursue

express themselves when addressing their tribes on imnportant subjects I siiould not have taken notice of this anonymous publi cation but that the high character and extensive circulation of the North

which the Greek boasts of they are not however deficienit in the expression of the relations of the present past and future to each other There is no shade of idea in respect to the time place and manner of action which an Indian verb cannot express and thie nmodes of expression which they make use of for those purposes are so numerous that if they were to be considered as parts ol the conjugation of each verb one single paradigm rnight fill a volume Thus nmitzi signifies I eat inl a general sense and nmamitzz I am eating at this moment Each of these verbs is separately conjugated in all its forms Indeed the multitude of ideas wlhich in the Indian lan guages are combined with the vern has justly attracted the attention of the learned in all parts of the world It is not their transitive conjugatioris expressing at the same time the idea of the person acting and that acted upon that have excited so much astonishment They are found also thiough not with the same rich variety of fornms in the Hebrew and other oriental languages But when two verbs with intermediate ideas are combined togethier into one as in the Delaware nschingiwipoma I do not like to eat with him which the Abbe Molina also declares to exist in the idiomn of Chili t tlere is sufficient cause to wonder particu larly when we compare the conmplication of these languages with the simplicity of the Chinese and its kindred dialects in the ancient worlld Whence can have arisen such a rarked diversity in the forms of hunman speech  Nor is it only with the verbs thiat accessary ideas are so

Latin phrase nisi veneris expresses all these mneanings but the Enrglishi If you do not come and the French Si vous iie venez pas have by no mnearns the sanie elegant pr ecision The idea which in

And where the two fornmer lanrguages express every tlhing with two words each of the latter requires five which yet repre sent a smaller nuimber of idleas To wlhich of these gram matical forms is the epithlet barbarous to be applied  This vety cursorv view of the general structure of the Indian langtuaes exemplified by the Delaware will at least convinice the reader that a considerable degree of art and method has pr esided over their formation Wlhetlher thiis as tonishing tfact is to be considered as a proof as many are inclined to believe that this conitinent was forinerly inhia bited by a

of a preface it is however necessary that I should say something of this grammar and of its author The Reverend David Zeisherger was a native of Mora via where he was horn in the year 1721 He was elu cated at Herrnhut in the principles of the reliaion of the United Brethren At the age of seventeen he came to this country and landled in Georgia where his coreligionists lhad begun sonme settlements Ihence hie came to Pennsvlvania In the year 1746 being twentv five years of age hie was sent out as a missionary to the North Amserican Inlianis in which employmiient he continiued witlh few and short intervals until his death whichi hiappened in the year 1808 He died at Goshen in thie state of Ohio at the advanced age of eightyseven years Thus this vetnerable missionary resided upwards of sixty years among the Inlians of this countrypreaching the gos pel to them in their native idioms In this nainer lie acquired several of tlheir languages but was particuilarlyOF THE LENNI LENAPE INDIANS 87

translated in1to English and I willingly undertook the task various circumstances hiave hitherto prevented its appearance Several learned men however both in Europe and in this countrv having repeatedly ex pressed their wish to see it in print its publication could no longer be delayed rIlrle reader must not expect to find lhere a philoso phical grammar as this was not nmade for the use of philo sophers but of youngr missionariesits object was entirely practical The author never dreamt that the theorv of the Indian languages would ever become tthe subject of philo sophical study He has followed the usual divisions of the parts of speechl blut has not endeavoured like the Spaniish American grammarians to force the Inidian formns of lan guiage into too close an analogy withi our own To a cer tain degree it is niecessary to explain the forms of the Indian languages by those to wlich we are accustomed to do otlherwise would be following the old exploded me thod of teaching the Latin language by means of a gram nmar written entirely in Latin  at the sanme time the leculiar forms of the new idiom ought to be pointed ouit in a clear and intelligible manner and their principles analyzed so as to lay down thieir rules when differing from ouLr own with the greatest possible perspicuity It were to be wisthed that our autthor had devoted a chapter to the syntax and phrasCology of the langruage but that I presume he left to be acquired by practice Upon the wlhole lhowever I think lis grammnar the best thiat I have seen of anl Ame rican dialect It is copious and rich in

words in this Grammar are to be pronouwced according to the powers of the Germiian alphabet wlichs Mr Zeisbherger thlought proper to adopt It has long beetn a desideratum in the philological science that there shouldl be a uniform mode of writing exotic words in order to convey as much as possible the same idea of their sounds at least to the learned through the civilized world But inidepend ent of the numerous difficulties whichi naturally attend such a design firom thie almost entire impossibility of conveying to the mind through the eye the idea of sounds which the ear never heard an ill understood national pride mlakes every nation desire that their own alphabet slhould be chosen as the mediumn of communication The least prejudiced on this subject insist at least on the Ronman character being univer sally used The celebrated Volney wishied all the Oriental  The translator has preserved the orthography of the original except that he has substituted the letter y for the German j because y has the same sound according to the English and German pronunciation Also where the author has introduced the vowel o after w in order to shew that the latter is to have the English and not the German sound and so writes woagan to be pronounced wagan the translator has suppressed the o thinking it sufficient to give notice that w consonant is always to be pronounced as in English whether it be followed by another conso nant or by a vowel In the former case a sheva or mute vowel is interposed between the two sounds thus wdanis daughter is pronounced wdanis and not oodanis Following the same principle where the author writes wiquoam a house the translator writes wikwam which is precisely the sound which Zeisberger meant to represent VOL IIIZ90 GRAMMAR OF THE LANGUAGE languages to be written in that character and not only pro losed a plan to that efflect but left a considerable legacy by his will to be employed in premiumns to those who slhould suggest the best means of carrying it into execution This shews how far a favourite idea nmav take hold of the mind of a man however distinguished by his genius and talents It is niot for those languages that have already an alphabet and an orthography of their own that a uniform nmode of writing their words is desirable uniformity in this respect even anmong the nations that use the same characters is ab solutely unattainable All that is desired is a common mode of communicating the sounds of unwritten languages in or der to facilitate the comparison of thieir words and gramma tical forms with each otlher with the greater exactness To this object the powers of our English alpthabet are not ade quate because its vowel sounds are uncertain and a great part of them are represented by cliphtlhonigs But most nations seem to think that their national honour is concerned in forcing their own orthography upon the learned world Thus since the study of the Clhinese language has becomne fashionable in Europe the Portuguese mode of spelling Chi nese words to wlhich all were before accustomed hlas been entirely abandoned and the English and Frenclh have each adopted the orthography of their own language so that it is sometinmes difficult to recognize the sanme words in the gram mars and dictionaries whichi they hiave respectivelv puiblished In this country we are free from this prejudice therefore my learned fiiend Mr pickerinig with the liberalitv wlhich characterizes an American man of science has proposed a unifoi rm mode of writing the words of our Indian languages which I am happy to find has been almnost universally adopted by our Missionaties not only on this continent but in the South Sea Islands I am also informed that our go  An Essay on a uniform Orthography for the

to say a few words respecting the present translation When eleven years ago I undertook to make it for the Philosophical So ciety I had never turned mly attention to the Indian lan guages and I was entitely ignoranit of their forms and con struction I tlherefore tlhought of nothing beyonid a close and literal translation of the manuscript I soon per ceived hiowever that it had been written on loose shieets which had been bound together after the Authors death by persons not conversant witlh the subject It also became clear to me that Mr Zeisberger had not given the last finiish inyg hand to his work He probably mneant to hiave con densed it and to have exhibited the various forms of the conjugations of the verbs in a lesser number of paradigmns These observations struck me as I went on with the transla tion wlhich I finished as I had begun it I left out only one chapter in which the author explained the miianner of ex pressing the Germani compotund verbs into the Delaware language as it would have required too much labour to adapt it to the English forms of speech and would have participa ted in too great a degree of an original composition I regret however that I did not attempt it It is now too late as Mr Zeisbergers manuscript has been returned to the Bethlehem library I had no idea at the time that this grammar would ever be published Since thle Society canme to a resolution to conmrnit it to the press it becarne my dtuty to revise what I had done I saw that it would r equire to be almost entirely recast and above all to be considerably ahridged in order to give it that form wlhich alotne could satisfy the taste of the present age But on this I could not venture For more than ten years indeed I have applied mnyself to the study of thie Inidian

induced nme not to make too free with this grammar although I am satisfied that it nmight have been advantageously abridged Several gentlemen Iar ticularly of the army who are stationed or reside in the viciniity of the Indian country and consequently have much intercourse with the aborigines have expressed a wishl that Mr Zeisbergers Work should be given in as ample a form as possible as it would he of great use to them in studying not otnly the language of the Delawares but also those of the Chippeways Menomonies and other cognate idioms Tlherefore it is to be considered that it is not only intenled as an exhibition of the forms of the Indian dialects in a scientific point of view but also as a guide to those who mav be engaged in the stuly of this language TI o thern the

terminations is supplied by the relative position of the noun or by gram matical forms or combinations of the verbs and other parts of speech as will be shewn in the following examples These grammatical forms or combinations are peculiar to the Indian languages and I believe are not to be found in any others They will be more fully explained under their proper heads At present I shall only shew in what manner what are commonly called the cases of nouns are expressed or indicated JNominative This case if it may be so called has no particular form or inflection It is simply the name of the substantive as in English Lenni the man Ochqueu the woman Wikwam the house Sipo or sipu the river Getanittowit God Gischuch the sun  Tote by the TranslatorThe Author does not speak of the article yet there is one in the Delaware language the article mo which is used either in a definite or indefinite sense as mhittuck a tree or the tree The Minsi say michtuk This article was discovered by the Trans lator in the Massachiusetts language and on inquiring of Mr Heckewelder he said that the same article was also in the Delaware but was not frequently used because the word was sufficiently understood without it See his letter to the Translator in the notes to Eliots Grammar 11th Mas sachusetts Historical Collections Second Series p xvOF THE LENNI LENAPE INDIANS 99 OF NOUNS Genitive The genitive is expressed by placing the noun employed in that sense immediatelv before that which is used in the nominative Sometimes also by prefixing to the nominative the inseparable pronoun of the third person w as we say in English John his book for Johns book Getannittowit quisall Gods son Nihillalquonk wtanglowagan the Lords death Getannitowit wtahoaltowagan Gods love Getannitowit gektemagelowagan Gods mercy Lennowikit the mans house Getannitowit wtallewussowagan Gods ma jesty Nihillalquonk allogewaganall the Lords works The Dative Is expressed by inflections in the verbs and by prefixes and suffixes which will be more particularly explained Nemilan I give to him Milap he gave to him Ndellap I said to him Nowitschemap I fetched to him Melat hallemiwi pommauchsowoagan eternal life Ndatschimolschap I related to him Notschap I went came to him Nowitschewap I went with him The Accusative Is likewise expressed by means of the verbs as is said above Ndahoala I love him Nowaha I know him Npendawa I understand him Npenauwelema I take care of him Npennauwa I look athim Nemachelema I honour him Getanittowit nquitayala I fear God God I fear him The

plural except in the third person where it ends in 1 but most commonly in wall The plural is variously inflected There is a singu lar number combined with the plural as in our father my fathers and a double plural as in ourfathers These are distinguished by particular inflections the double plural by the duplication of a syllable Substan tives are generally combined with the inseparable possessive pronoun which in the singular is n for the first person k for the second and w or o for the third The inseparable pronoun is often omitted in the plural and in the third person singular and the sense is determined by the nu meric inflection which is at the same time pronominal Those inflec tions are na or nana in the first person wa or wawa in the second and wall wak and wawall in the third The duplication of a syllable as nct na wawa wawawall indicates the double plural EXAMPLES Wetoochwink Father Singular Nooch my father Kooch thy father Ochwall his or her father Singular with Plural

Nochenaninga our deceased fathers Muchomsena our grandfather I Muchomsenaninga our deceased grandfathers Kimachtenaninga our deceased brothers Chesmussenaninga our deceased sisters Gohessenaninga our

Elauwitschik hunters Of the various kinds of Substantives The substantive combines itself in this language with almost every part of speech but principally with the verb We have seen those immediately derived from active or neutral verbs we shall now proceed to others of an analogous description 1 There are substantives derived from passive verbs they end in wa gan and have no plural EXAMPLES Machelemuxowagan honour the being ho noured Gettemegelemuxowagan the being shewn fa vour mercv tenderness Mamschalgussowagan the being held in re membr ance Mamintochimgussowagan the being esteemed

Mamachtschimgussowagan the being insulted Pilsohalgussowagan holiness purity And many others of the same kind NoteIt might indeed be said that substantives in this language have a passive mood so nearly are they allied to verbs as will be shewn in its place 2 There are moreover substantives which are akin to participles such as Ahoalgussit the beloved Mechelemuxit the honoured Nilchgussit the killed Lekhikit the one who is writing Mikemossit the one who is labouring the la bourer Nanhillowit the one who takes care of the dead Schingaluesit the enemy the adversary 3 There are also those

is the light Wdallemunsit the owner of the cattle Wewikit the master of the house Wenitschanit a childs father or mother Gettemagelowaganit he who is mercy Tschitanessowaganit he who is strengthOP THE

already been given under the head of nouns Personal pronouns are either separable or inseparable but are much more frequently used in the latter form The Separable Pronouns are Singular Ni I Ki thou Neka or nekama he or she I Plural  Kiluna or niluna we Kiluwa you Nekamawa they The inseparable pronouns are in both numbers n for the first person k in the second w in the third When two pronouns are employed VOLT TII 2 F110 GRAMMAR OF THE LANGUAGE OF VERBS in verbs the last or the pronoun governed is expressed by an inflection as in kdahoalohhumo I love you kdahoalineen thou lovest us kdaho alawak thou lovest them as will be seen more fully under the head of conjugations The possessive pronoun is the same as the personal separable and inseparable which is employed in a possessive sense No ambiguity results from this similarity the meaning is always understood from the context or the form or inflexion of the word with which the pronoun is combined The various combinations of these pronouns must be gathered from their connection with the other parts of speech and cannot all be given under this head Thus the personal pronoun combines itself with the conjunction also Nepe I also kepe thou also Nepena or kepena we also as the word is used in the general or particular plural Kepewo you also Kepoak they also JNote by the TranslatorThe particular plural refers to a certain description of persons as we Delawares we who are here together the other has a more general application and shews that no discrimination is intended In verbs n prefixed from niltuna indicates the particular and k from kiluna the general plural in the first person See Hecke welders Corresp in Histor Trans p 429 The author is silent on this subject DEMONSTRATIVE AND RELATIVE PRONOUNS The modes

lit THERE is a great variety of verbs in this language To exhibit all their compound forms would be an endless task Every part of speech may be compounded with the verb in many ways as will be seen in the course of this work The verbs to have and to be do not exist in the Delaware language either as auxiliaries or in the abstract substantive sense which they pre sent to an European mind The verb to have always conveys the idea of possession and to be that of a particular situation of the body or mind and they may be combined like other verbs with other accessary ideas Thus the verb to have or possess is combined with the substantive or the thing possessed as follows Ndamochol I have a canoe Wtamochol he has a canoe Matta ndamocholiwi I have no canoe Ntemaiican I have an axe Nowikin I have a house Wiku he has a house Wikuwek they have a house Ndallemansin I have cattle Wdallemansu he has cattle Npachksikan I have a knife Npeyakhikan I have a gun The idea conveyed by the substantive verb to be is expressed by various combinations with other parts of speech as for instance With the Substantive Ni ndamochol it is my canoe Ki kdamochol it is thy canoe Nekama wdamochol it is his or her canoe Kiluna ndamocholena it is our canoe Kiluwa ndamocholuwa it is your canoe INekamawa wdamochowawall it is their canoe ji ndalloquepi it is my hat Ki kdalloquepi it is thy hat Nekama wdalloquepi it is his or her hat Ni ndacquiwan it is my blanket With the Pronoun uwen who Singular Ewenikia who I am Ewenikian who thou art Ewenikit who he is Plural Ewenikiyenk who we are Ewenikiyek who you are Ewenikichtit who they are Mlende some Plural Alendemiyenk some of us Alendemiyek some of you Alendemowak or alendemichtit some of them  JVote by the TranslatorThe apostrophe between the inseparable pronoun and the noun or verb indicates a sheva or mute vowel Eliot in his Massachusetts Grammar indicates it by the English short u he would write for instance nuttappin for ndappin This apostrophe is some times omitted in the course of this grammar but is always to be understood1 12 GRAMMAR OF THE LANGUAGE OF VERBS The idea of the verb to be is also combined with adjectives and adverbs as will be seen under the heads of  adjective and adverbial verbs OF THE CONJUGATIONS There are eight conjugations The first ends in in as Achpin to be there in a particular place Mikemossin to work The second ends in a Infinitive in an as Nda I am going Paan to come The third ends in elendam and indicates a disposition of the mind as Schiwelendam to be sorry I Wulelendam to be glad The fourth ends in men as Ngattamen I request I Npendamen I hear The fifth ends in an as Ahoalan to love The sixth ends in e or we infinitive en as Ndellowe I say I Infin Luen to say The seventh ends in in It has no simple active or passive voice and is only conjugated through the personal forms or transitions as Miltin to give The eighth ends in tonhas the simple active but not the passive form and has the personal indicative and subjunctive transitions as Peton to bring I Npeton I bring The same inseparable pronouns are used with the verbs as with the substantives The letters which indicate the pronoun and are prefixed to the verb are n k and w or o They must be pronounced with a short interval when followed by a consonantOF THE LENNI LENAPE INDIANS 113 OF VERBS SFirtt eConjuatfon No I POSITIVE FORM

the plural is used in a general sense it should be kpenameen kpendameen See Heckew Corresp in 1 Hist Trans 428 The author makes no mention in this Grammar of these two plurals which is however a remarkable peculiarity in the Indian languages As has been observed in the preface Mr Zeisberger did not write for Philologists and has left many curi ous facts respecting the forms of this language entirely unnoticed and to be acquired by practice Those who wish for nmore information on these interesting subjects are referred to the above cited correspondence of Mr Heckewelder where they will find enough to satisfy their curiosity The reader will also observe that the author gives two different forms ndappineen or ndappi henno to express the words we are there and he does the same in many places throughout these conjugations This Mr Heckewelder said was in order to shew the inflections of the Delaware verbs in the Unami and the Mfinsi dialects and he promised to point out to the Translator which belonged to the one and which to the other But he died before he could fulfil his promise VOLT I12 P114 GRAMMAR OF THE LANGUAGE FIRST CONJUGATION Future The future is characterized by

of body and mind will appear here to be strangely confounded But the most polished nations of antiquity have hardly been more successful in their endeavours to express ideas that are not perceptible to our senses The words wvs6jAce spiritus are at best metaphors drawn from sensible objects and the same result will probably be found in all languages if we recur to the etymology of the words which are meant to express soul mind c See the note above p 166 VOL imI3 F206 GRAMMAR 01 THE LANGUAGE OF VERBS ebenth ktonjuqatfou MILTIr to give This verb has no simple active voice we cannot say I give

not classed under their different conjugations but mostly belong ing to the first In the translation which I made for the Philosophical Society I inserted therm un der the head of additional verbs On examining thenm afterwards more closely I found several were deficient in moods and tenses and were clearly considered by the author only as materials to be made use of in a revision of his work Among them were repetitions of verbs already given but in some respects more complete containing mnoods and tenses which in the first examples were wanting It will be seen in the verbs particularly of the first conjugation that they are not all carried through their different voices forms moods and tenses so that one often supplies the deficiencies of the others If the author had lived it is probable that he would have brought his work to a greater degree of perfection This I could not undertake to do but I thought it unne cessary to swell this grammar with these additional verbs and fragments of ver bs thus inserted with out order or method I therefore left out all that belonged to the first conjugation already full enough contenting myself with extracting what was wanting in the first paradigms in order to complete them as much as possible Of the other additional verbs I have inserted two or three under their proper conjugations leaving out the remainder which I am satisfied was not intended to remain in its present formOF THE LENNI LENAPE INDIANS 223 OF VERBS IRREGULAR VERBS OR VERBS THAT ARE DEFICIENT IN PERSONS OR TENSES Note by the TranslatorThese are chiefly of the class

TranslatorThe author observes here that he hesitated long whether he should class adjectives by themselves or include them all under the head of verbs On the one hand he could not but observe that there are in this language pure adjectives which receive different forms when ernploved in the verbal sense such as wulit wulik wulisso good handsome pIetty wulilissu he she or it is good pretty or hand some and several others of which the author gives examples as for in stance Class I in sabbeleechen sparkling glittering whence sabbeleu it sparkles glitters But these are not very numerous A great number of them are impersonal verbs in the third person of the singular of the present tense while others are conjugated through various persons moods and tenses as appears from the following examples He determined at last after presenting a few under the head of adjectives above page 103 to include them all in a list of verbs of this description which the Trans lator has called adjective verbs as he has denominated adverbial verbs those which are formed by or derived from them It is to be regretted that the venerable missionary did not more particularly distinguish the pure adjectives frorm the others and did not enter more fully into this subject It is most certain that all the adjectives of the Delaware language are not verbs but a rule or principle of discriminiation is wanting and the Trans lator cannot undertake to establish it The Author here exhibits a list of adjective verbs divided into eleven classes according to their terminiation which in the three first is that of the third person singular of the indicative mood of tire first conjugation The first is in eu the second in wi the third in u or o the fourth in on or an the fifth in ot at the sixth in to the seventh in i the eighth in it ik et the ninth in en the tenth in en or on and the eleventh in tn This last appears to belong to the first conjugation and its termination is that of the infinitive mood It is

of writing Its forms are rich regular and methodical closely following the analogy of the ideas which they are intended to express compounded but not confused occasionally ellip tical in their mode of expression but not more so than the languages of Europe and much less so than those of a large group of nations on the Eastern Coast of Asia I mean the Chinese and those which possess analogous idioms The terminations of their verbs expressive of num ber person time and other modifications of action and passion while they are richer in their extension than those of the Latin and the Greek which we call emphatically the learned languages appear to have been formed on a similar but enlarged model without any aid than that which was afforded by nature operating upon the intellectual faculties of man To what cause are these phenomena to be attributed  1 hope I shall be excused for saying that this question which I think of the highest importance as it leads immediately to that of the origin of the variety of human languages and perhaps of language itself has not received either in America or Europe all the attention that it de serves In Europe an idea appears generally to prevail that the gram matical forms of languages have proceeded if not entirely at least in a very great degree from the operation or influence of the art of writing which is saying in other words that these forms have been produced or essentially modified by the arts of civilization A celebrated French philologist to whose varied talents and extensive acquirements no man pays a more willing homage than myself M Abel Remusat expressesOF THE LENNI LENAPE INDIANS 249 CONCLUDING NOTE himself thus on this subject  I do not only speak of those forms the object of which is to point out the relations of words and the mechanism of which simple or complicated ingenious or confused attests the more or less successful efforts of the writers who first gave laws to language This learned author whose exquisite sense and sound judgment leave no roomn to suppose that it ever occurred to him that his proposition might be conitradicted appears evidently to have considered it as one of those philological axioms which have been so long and so universally estab lished that no one even thinks of calling them in question And so it has appeared to many other European writers and it seems in fact to be an opinion generally received in that part of the world I must own that to me it seems inconsistent with the facts which this Grammar exhibits and which all point to nature and not to art as the source from whence have proceeded the various grammatical forms of the languages of men I have not room to develop here this conclusion more than I have done incidentally in the preface I have thought it right however to point it out specifically as the principal result which in my opinion the publica tion of this Grammar will produce It appears to me that after a care ful reading of the work and a comparison of this language with those of civilized nations the mind must be necessarily drawn to the following inferences 1 That the grammatical forms of a language constitute what may be called its organization 2 That this organization is the work of nature and not of civilization or its arts 3 That the arts of civilization may cultivate and by that means polish a language to a certain extent but can no more alter its organization than the art of the gardener can change that of an onion or a potato 4 That the contrary opinion is the result of the pride of civilized men a passion inherent in our nature and the greatest obstacle that exists to the investigation of truth In thus expressing my opinion with all the clearness and precision that I am capable of I do not by any means intend to establish these propositions as axioms but merely to submit them as questions to the investigation of the learned if they shall be thought worthy of the atten tion to which it appears that the subject entitles them That new facts or facts already known in part but now more clearly made apparent should produce new opinions is what may naturally be expected and he will be I hope acquitted of presumption who simply expresses his sentiments on this new subject without any other pretension than that of eliciting the  Je ne parle pas seulement de ces foimes destinees a marquer les rapports

consequences To what degree nature and art have respectively contributed to the formation of languages or their improvement appears to me to be a ques tion highly deserving of deep consideration I am afraid the part of na ture will be found to be the lions share If it be true that the poems attributed to Homer were composed at a time when the Greeks were ignorant of the art of writing we have the true measure of natures share in the formation of this beautifiil language The Romans who could write did not prove by their idiom the superiority of art Many observations arising from the details of this Grammar and which would considerably tend to the elucidation of its contents have suggest ed themselves to my mind while this volume was passing through the press some of them I have subjoined in the form of notes and the rest I must reserve for another opportunity I ought to observe however before I finally conclude that the Author writes the termination of the third person plural of the Perfect Tense of the Indicative indifferently pannik orpannil without any apparent rule of discrimination This was noticed by Vater who published a few Delaware conjugations under the name of Chippeway from some loose sheets of Zeisbergers own manuscript which I had transmitted to him The learn ed professor was of opinion that pannik was the correct reading and I have in consequence adopted it throughout this Grammar Perhaps the difference arises from the variety of dialects See dnaiekten der Sprachenkunde Zweytes Heft p 50 in noteERRATA This mark t  shews that the lines are to

J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,105852,A DESCRIPTION OF THE LYMPHATIOS OF THE URETHRA AND NECK OF THE BLADDER BY HENRY WATSON SURGEON TO THE WESTMINSTER HOSPITAL AND F R S,I206924,392 LIV A DESCRIPTION OF THE LYMPHATICS OF THE URETHRA AND NECK OF THE BLADDER BY HENRY WATSON SURGEON TO THE WESTMIN STER HOSPITAL AND F R S THE VALVULAR LYMPHATICS AS A SYSTEM OF VESSELS SUI GENERIS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE A VERY CONSIDERABLE OFFICE IN THE ANIMAL AECO NOMY BUT AN OFFICE SUBORDINATE TO THAT OF THE BLOOD VESSELS AT LEAST THEY HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED BY MANY OF THE PHYSIOLOGISTS NOT OF SO MUCH CONSEQUENCE IN PRE SERVING THE HEALTH AND LIFE OF THE ANIMAL READ DEC 14 1769 IF WE CONSIDER THAT AN OBSTRUCTED THORACIC DUCT WHICH IS IN FACT BUT A LARGE LYMPHATIC WILL DESTROY LIFE AS EFFECTUALLY AS A LIGATURE MADE UPON THE AORTA ITSELF WE MUST CONCLUDE THE LYMPHATICS TO BE VESSELS OF MUCH GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN SOME HAVE IMAGINED NEARLY OF AS MUCH CONSEQUENCE IN SUPPORTING AND CARRYING ON THE ANIMAL FUNCTIONS AS THE ARTERIES AND VEINS THEMSELVES FOR IF AN OBSTRUCTION OF THE AORTA OR GREAT ARTERY CAN PRODUCE A VERY QUICK OR SUDDEN DEATH AN OBSTRUCTED THORACIC DUCT WILL AS CERTAINLY LEAD TO A TEDIOUS AND LINGERING ONE THE CASE OF THE OBSTRUCTED DUCT THOUGH NOT INDEED OFTEN SEEN YET IS EVERY NOW AND THEN TO BE MET WITH IT IS THE ONE CAUSE OF A MARASMUS NOT KNOWN OR NOT ATTENDED TO GENERALLY OWING TO AN ENLARGEMENT OF THE393 THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS THAT LIE NEAR TO AND IN CONTACT WITH THE DUCT GENERALLY TOO ATTENDED WITH OBSTRUC TIONS IN THE MORE EXTERNAL CONGLOBATE GLANDS THERE FORE ALWAYS TO BE SUSPECTED WHERE WE HAVE THESE APPEARANCES ACCOMPANIED WITH A GRADUAL WASTING OF THE SOLIDS IN CHILDREN AND YOUNG SUBJECTS WE MEET WITH PROOFS OF THIS DISEASE A DISEASE WHICH NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN LEARNT BUT FROM THE DISSECTION OF MORBID BODIES THE LYMPHATICS ARE SAID TO BE THE TRUE AND ONLY SYSTEM OF ABSORBING VESSELS I WILL SUPPOSE THEY ARE THOUGH PERHAPS THIS OPINION MAY YET ADMIT OF SOME DOUBTS HOWEVER THEY CERTAINLY ARE THE VESSELS THAT TAKE UP THE WATERY LATEX FROM MOST PARTS OF THE BODY AND RETURN IT BACK TO BE AGAIN MIXED WITH THE BLOOD THIS FREE ABSORPTION OF THE LYMPH IS THE GREAT SECU RITY AGAINST SUFFOCATION INJURIOUS PRESSURE AND AN OBSTRUCTED CIRCULATION IN EVERY PART OF THE ANIMAL MANY VALUABLE DISCOVERIES HAVE LATELY BEEN MADE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THESE VESSELS IN BIRDS FISH AND AMPHIBII THAT MOST ACCURATE AND INDEFATIGABLE ANA TOMIST DR HUNTER HAS WRIT FULLY AND EXPLICITLY UPON THE LYMPHATICS IN THE HUMAN BODY AND YET STILL IT IS TO BE WISHED WE KNEW MORE ABOUT THEM WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE THEIR ORIGINS IN ANY ONE INSTANCE WE HAVE NOT TRACED THEM THROUGH THE WHOLE BODY AS WE HAVE DONE THE BLOODVESSELS IT IS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THEY ABOUND UNIVERSALLY BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN MANY PARTS THEY EXIST OR NOT FOR THE MOST EMINENT ANATOMISTS CONFESS THERE ARE MANY PARTS IN WHICH HITHERTO THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER THEM VOL LIX E E E IT394 IT MAY NOT THEREFORE BE UNENTERTAINING TO THIS LEARNED SOCIETY WHO SO STUDIOUSLY PROMOTE EVERY USE FUL INQUIRY NOT ONLY TO HAVE A DEMONSTRATIVE PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF LYMPHATICS IN A PART OF THE HUMAN BODY WHERE THEY HAVE NOT AS YET BEEN DISCOVERED BUT ALSO TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF KNOWING THAT THE TRUE ORIGIN OF THESE VESSELS MAY EASILY BE SHEWN AS TO THEIR PRECISE ORIGIN IT HAS INDEED BEEN CON JECTURED AND VERY REASONABLY FROM EXPERIMENTS A POSTERIORI IT HAS BEEN SUPPOSED THEY ARISE FROM ALL THE SURFACES AND CAVITIES OF THE BODY BECAUSE THIN FLUIDS AND SUBTLE PARTICLES WILL BE TAKEN UP FROM SUCH CAVITIES OR SUR FACES AND WILL BE READILY ENOUGH CONVEYED INTO THE BLOOD BUT THEN IT HAS NEVER BEEN SHEWN THAT THEY DO ARISE FROM ANY ONE SUCH SURFACE OR CAVITY COMMONLY THE LYMPHATICS ARE NEVER FILLED FROM THEIR BEGINNINGS OR LITTLE ORIFICES WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN INJECTED IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN DONE BY USING SOME VIOLENCE EITHER BY CUTTING INTO THEM BURSTING OR TEARING THEM ASUNDER SO THAT THE INJECTION RATHER GETS IN SOME HOW AT THE SIDE AND NOT AT THE EXTRE MITY OF THE VESSEL THE LACTEAL VESSELS PERHAPS CANNOT AT LEAST HAVE NEVER BEEN TO MY KNOWLEDGE INJECTED FROM THE CAVITY OF THE INTESTINE IN THE DEAD BODY IT IS PRESUMED THAT AS THE LYMPHATICS ARE SIMILAR TO THESE IN OTHER RESPECTS THEIR ORIGINS MUST BE ALSO SIMILAR THAT IF THE ORIFICES OF THE LACTEALS ARE TOO FINE TO BE DISCOVERED THE MOUTHS OF THE LYMPHATICS ARE ALSO TOO DELICATE TO BE TRACED OUT BUT WITH REGARD TO THE LYMPHATICS OF THE HUMAN URINARY BLADDER IT IS CER TAINLY OTHERWISE WHEN THE PART IS FRESH AND SOUND 2 WE395 WE MAY WITH A LITTLE TROUBLE BLOW INTO THE MOUTHS OF THESE VESSELS SMALL AS THEY ARE OR INTRODUCE A FINE BRISTLE INTO THEM IF WE HAVE BUT A STEADY HAND AND A GOOD EYE I HAVE FREQUENTLY DONE BOTH IN THE PRE SENCE OF MANY WITNESSES SO THAT WITHOUT USING THE KNIFE OR LANCET THE LEAST FORCE OR VIOLENCE AIR MAY BE THROWN INTO THE LYMPHATICS FROM THEIR VERY BE GINNINGS AND MERCURY MAY BE MADE TO PASS BY THE SAME ORIFICES THOUGH I HAVE SAID WE MAY EASILY HAVE AN OCULAR DEMONSTRATION OF THE ORIGIN OR MOUTH OF THE LYMPHA TIC IN THIS PART OF THE HUMAN BODY I MUST CONFESS IT IS NOT ALWAYS WE CAN HAVE THAT SATISFACTION NO PART IS MORE FREQUENTLY DISEASED INFLAMMATION SOLDERS UP THE MOUTHS OF THESE LITTLE VESSELS AND IT IS NOT TO BE EXPECTED WE CAN SHEW THEIR ORIFICES WHEN THE URETHRA IS IN SUCH A STATE IT WILL ALWAYS REQUIRE SOME DEXTERITY TO CATCH THE OPENING OF THE LYMPHATIC BUT THE BRISTLE ONCE FAIRLY INTRODUCED WILL GENERALLY PASS WITH GREAT EASE SOME WAY WITHIN THE VESSEL HERE THEN WE MAY SATISFY OURSELVES IN WHAT MANNER THE LYMPHATICS DO ACTUALLY BEGIN FROM SURFACES AND TO THOSE WHO WITHOUT EVER HAVING SEEN THE ORIGIN OF A LYMPHATIC HAVE NEVERTHELESS REASONED SO WELL AND SO JUSTLY UPON THIS SUBJECT IT MAY PERHAPS AFFORD SOME PLEASURE AND SATISFACTION TO FIND THEIR CONJECTURES AGREE ING SO PERFECTLY WITH THE STRUCTURE THE SITUATION OF THE LYMPHATICS IN GENERAL IS SU PERFICIAL THAT IS TO SAY THEY ARE MOSTLY TO BE SEEN UPON SURFACES THOUGH THERE ARE SOME DEEPER SEATED ONES WHICH ACCOMPANY THE BLOOD VESSELS THEY HAVE BEEN E E E 2 WELL396 WELL DESCRIBED BY AUTHORS AS EXCEEDING FINE TENDER AND TRANSPARENT VESSELS FREQUENTLY JOINING INTO ONE ANOTHER AND INTERSECTED BY A NUMBER OF VERY DELICATE MEMBRANOUS POUCHES OR VALVES SO THAT HAVING AN INJECTION THROWN INTO THEM THEY GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF BEING FULL OF LITTLE KNOTS THE LYMPHATICS ARE APPARENT ENOUGH WHEN THEY UNITE AND GROW LARGE BUT FROM THEIR EXILITY WANT OF COLOUR AND TRANSPARENCY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO BE DIS COVERED BEFORE OWING TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS THAT THEIR ORIGINS HAVE NEVER BEFORE BEEN SEEN AND THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE BODY WHERE THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS SUPPOSED TO EXIST THEY STILL LIE UNNOTICED HALLER AFTER SPEAKING OF THESE VESSELS IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY GOES ON THUS  QUAE A PENE VENIUNT MIHI MINUS NOTA  SUNT SED DICTA COWPERO

WHO KNOWS SO WELL THE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BODY KNOWS NOTHING OF THESE LYMPHATICS OF THE BLADDER OR MEMBRANOUS PORTION OF THE URETHRA THE LYMPHATICS OF THE URINARY HUMAN BLADDER AND URETHRA FIRST SHEW THEMSELVES ON EACH SIDE THE VERU MONTANUM OR CAPUT GALLINAGINIS AND BY VERY LITTLE ORI FICES TAKE THEIR ORIGIN FROM THE INTERNAL MEMBRANE THAT LINES THE URETHRA AND BLADDER ON WHOSE SURFACE THEY OPEN IN THEIR NATURAL STATE THEY APPEAR LIKE SO MANY FINE THREADS LYING CLOSE TOGETHER BUT DIVERGING AFTERWARDS AS397 AS THEY PASS OVER THE PROSTATE GLAND AND NECK OF THE BLADDER AND INOSCULATING OR COMMUNICATING VERY FRE QUENTLY THEY FORM A KIND OF NETWORK OR EMBROIDERY FROM HENCE THEY ARE CONTINUED THROUGH THE CELLULAR MEMBRANE BEHIND THE INTERNAL COAT OF THE BLADDER AND SEEM TO JOIN WITH THE LYMPHATICS OF THE VESICULAE SEMINALES TO BE CONTINUED WITH THEM TO THE NEIGH BOURING GLANDS AND SO ON TO THE THORACIC DUCT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND LYMPHATICS IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE URETHRA INDEED THIS CANAL SEEMS TO BE PERFECTLY VOID OF THEM TILL WE COME TO ITS MEMBRANOUS PORTION WHERE WE MEET WITH THESE I HAVE BEEN DE SCRIBING AND IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT HERE THEY ARE PLACED IN THAT PART OF THE URETHRA WHERE THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF MOISTURE IS SUPPLIED VERY PROBABLY THE SEALING UP THE MOUTHS OF THESE DELICATE VESSELS BY FRE QUENT INFLAMMATION AND INDURATION MAY GIVE RISE TO THAT OBSTINATE STILLICIDIUM WHICH IS SELDOM OR EVER CURED OWING TO AN ACCUMULATION OF THIN FLUIDS WITH A FAULTY ABSORPTION THESE LYMPHATICS OF THE URETHRA AND BLADDER ALSO POINT OUT THE ROAD BY WHICH ANY SUBTLE VIRUS MAY PASS WITH THE LYMPH DIRECTLY INTO THE MASS OF BLOOD AND CONTAMINATE THE WHOLE HABIT WITHOUT GIVING THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF ANY LOCAL DISORDER TO HAVE A CLEARER IDEA OF THE VESSELS I

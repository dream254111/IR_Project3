every description in his attempt to discover the re mains of our unfortunate countrymen Gathering information and supported by good will on all sides he is making slow but regular advance We can only hope that he will attain his object while we do not ignore the dangers to which he so generously exposes himself in trying to penetrate accompanied only by all interpreter a country inhabited by In dians who overthrew the mission of Dr Crevaux Our warmest hopes for success go with him in his noble undertaking At the extreme south of America at Tierra del Fuego a French mission established a year ago has been commissioned in accordance with the interna tionlal programme to make meteorological and mag netic observations We look forward to the next return of the guardships whose work accomplished under the direction of Mr Martial commander of the Romanche will form a valuable contribution to the physical geography of these parts Finally after a successful expedition to the north ern latitudes in the polar seas which since the voy age of the Recherche have scarcely seen the French flag one of our countrymen Mr Charles Rabot is at present continuing in Russian Lapland the inves tigations which he began in Sweden The region which he includes still offers a vast field for geo graphical and geological study Such my dear colleagues are the chief means by which the advance of French geography in its most active and most persistent form is disclosed I might still speak to you at length but we must not deserve the reproach of weaving for ourselves crowns and in the noble titles I have just recalled to you we should see rather the obligations they place upon us than the satisfaction which they bring to our proper national pride LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Marriage laws of the Omahas and cognate tribes THE Dakotas or Sioux still have motherright in some of their tribes and I cannot say how far the following statements apply to them but the Omahas Ponkas Kansas Osages and others have fatherright and are governed by the principles here given with one exception the Kansas have re cently disregarded their laws and have begun to marry in the gens The Omaha tribe is divided into ten gentes or clans each gens having its special place in the tribal circle In the figure the numerals denote the gentes and the letters the subgentes Suppose that I belong to 1 the Elk

now planning to push his inquiries into the laws of heredity upon a more ex tensive and systematic stale than ever before The success of his early work Hereditary genius led him to observations in a wider field which extended over several years and were collected in his very valuable book Inquiries into the human faculty which appeared last spring His new proposal in volves the collection of a large number of family biological histories to extend over three or four generations and to be obtained by circulating an ex haustive schedule of printed questions The writer has just received a copy of the latter together with a prospectus of the general plan which Mr Galton will call Family registers The revised schedules will shortly be ready for distribution In the mean time an abstract of the prospectus and schedule may be given Mr Galton foresees the difficulties which he will encounter and appreciating that the obtaining of ac curate family histories of health and disease among laymen is almost out of the question his prospec tus appeals principally to the medical profession Among doctors all inherited disease is a disease and not necessarily an hereditary disgrace as most of the laity are apt to regard it In this class also the scientific interest attached to inherited imperfec tions of physique or mind often overbears every other feeling At all events although the anonymous will be strictly maintained Mr Galton seems to expect that few nonprofessional persons will be ready even

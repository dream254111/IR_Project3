HYDROCEPHALUS AND FOR OTHER EVACUATIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO BE MADE AT DIFFERENT TIMES BY M LE CAT F R S TRANS LATED FROM THE FRENCH BY THO STACK M D F R S ON THE 15 OF OCTOBER 1744 PETER MICHEL AN INFANT OF THREE MONTHS AND A HALF OLD SON OF A WEAVER OF THE SUBURB OF ST SEVER OF ROUEN WAS BROUGHT TO ME HAVING HIS HEAD FOR FIVE WEEKS PAST ONLY AS BIG AS IT APPEARS IN FIG 1 ALL THE SUTURES OF THE SCULL WERE CONSIDER ABLY SEPARATED ASUNDER THE EXTERIOR VEINS OF THE HEAD VERY MUCH SWOLN AND THE EYES TURNED DOWN WARD THIS INFANT WAS PRETTY PLUMP AND HAD HAD NO DISTEMPER BEFORE THIS ACCIDENT BUT FROM THE TIME IT APPEARD HE BECAME VERY FROWARD FAR FROM BEING DULL OR LETHARGIC AS SOME AUTHORS SAY READ OCT 31 1751 A HYDROCEPHALUS OF SO ENORMOUS A SIZE AND SO SPEEDILY FORMED APPEARD TO ME INCURABLE BY MEDI CINES IN SO YOUNG AN INFANT AND ENTERTAINING NO GREATER HOPES FROM THE OPERATION I EXHORTED THE PARENTS TO PATIENCE THEY CAME AGAIN TO ME AND EARNESTLY IN TREATED ME SAYING THAT THEIR CHILD COULD NOT POSSIBLY HOLD OUT LONG AGAINST A DISTEMPER WHICH GAIND GROUND SO VERY FAST THEY TOOK THE EVENT ON THEM SELVES AND BY FORCE OF INTREATIES MADE ME RESOLVE ON THE OPERATION I SUSPECTED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE DEATHS AND SUD DEN TOO FOR THE MOST PART OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN L L 2 PUNCTURED268 PUNCTURED FOR THE HYDROCEPHALUS MIGHT PROBABLY BE THAT ALL THE WATER HAD BEEN DRAWN OFF AT ONCE AND THAT THE BRAIN HAD BEEN LEFT AS IT WERE UNCOVERD AND EXPOSED TO THE IMPRESSIONS OF THE AIR WHICH MUST NECESSARILY FILL THE WIDE SPACE THAT HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE WATER SINCE IN THIS CASE THE INTE GUMENTS COULD NOT BE PRESSED CLOSE ON THE CONTAINED PARTS AS IT HAPPENS TO THE INTEGUMENTS OF THE ABDO MEN AFTER THE PUNCTURE IN THE ASCITES WHEREFORE SINCE I WAS PREVAILED ON TO MAKE THE PUNCTURE I RE SOLVED TO DRAW THE WATER BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AT DIF FERENT TIMES DISTANT FROM EACH OTHER AND IN THE INTERVALS OF THESE EVACUATIONS TO COMPRESS THE INTEGU MENTS WITH A PROPER BANDAGE TO MAKE THEM COME NEAR THE BRAIN THE COMMON TROCARTS DID NOT SEEM PROPER TO FUL FIL THESE VIEWS I WAS OF OPINION THAT PUNCTURES OFTEN REPEATED IN THESE NERVOUS PARTS WERE DANGEROUS BESIDES AS THE INTEGUMENTS OF THE HEAD WERE THIN AND UPON THE STRETCH THE OPENING BEING ONCE MADE WOULD NEVER CLOSE SUFFICIENTLY TO STOP THE EVACUATION WHEN THE CANULA WAS REMOVED AND IF I LEFT THE CA NULA IN THE ORIFICE AND STOPPD IT WITH A STOPPLE THIS SAME DISPOSITION OF THE INTEGUMENTS WOULD SUFFER THE WATER TO OUZE OUT BETWEEN THEM AND THE SIDES OF THE CANULA THUS WOULD THE EVACUATION BECOME TOTAL IN SPITE OF ME WHATEVER METHOD I USED WITH THE TROCARTS ALREADY KNOWN THESE REFLECTIONS MADE ME CONTRIVE THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENT IT IS A NEW TROCART REPRESENTED BY FIG 2 AND WHICH HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT THE CANULA IS MUCH SHORTER THAN ORDINARY THIS CANULA IS REPRESENTED SEPARATE IN FIG 3 BUT THERE OUGHT TO BE SEVERAL OF269 OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS FOR DIFFERENT CASES ON THE UPPER PART OF THIS CANULA THERE ARE TWO CIRCLES EACH ONE OF WHICH IS FASTEND TO A DIFFERENT PIECE THESE PIECES ARE EXHIBITED SEPARATE IN FIG 4 AND THEY ARE MADE SO AS TO BE SCREWD ONE ON THE OTHER THESE CIRCLES ARE SOMEWHAT CONCAVE IN THEIR SURFACES WHICH CORRESPOND RECIPROCALLY SO THAT THEIR CIRCUMFERENCES TOUCH WHILE THERE IS A TOLERABLE VACUITY TOWARDS THEIR CENTRE BY MEANS OF THIS SIMPLE MECHANISM I APPLY THE PLASTER X WITH A HOLE IN IT ON THE LOWER CIRCLE A WHOSE SCREW PASSES INTO THE HOLE OF THE PLAISTER THIS DONE I SCREW THE UPPER PIECE B ON THE LOWER A AND I SQUEEZE THE PLAISTER TIGHT BETWEEN THESE TWO CIRCLES THE INSTRUMENT BECOMES THEN AS IN FIG 5 THE PLAISTER WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN IS THAT OF ANDREAS A CRUCE BUT ONE MAY USE BURGUNDYPITCH OR ANY OTHER POWERFUL EMPLASTIC AT PLEASURE MY PLAISTER WAS THREE INCHES BROAD TO THE UPPER END OF THE CANULA I ADAPTED A VERY EXACT SILVER STOPPLE C FIG 3 THE PART WHERE I INTENDED TO MAKE THE PUNCTURE WAS SHAVED WIDER THAN THE PLAISTER THUS HAVING PREPARED EVERY THING AND THE CANULA BEING ARMED WITH ITS TROCART AND FORTIFIED WITH THE PLAISTER AS IT APPEARS FIG 5 I PERFORMED THE PUNC TURE ON FRIDAY THE 23 OF OCTOBER 1744 BY THRUSTING IN THE TROCART AND CANULA UP TO THE CIRCLES AND PLAIS TER WHICH I APPLIED AND MADE TO STICK IN ALL ITS PARTS ON THE HEAD BY PRESSING IT WITH MY HAND AND FINGERS MADE VERY WARM AND ALSO WITH HOT LINEN CLOTHS WHEN THE PLAISTER WAS THOROUGHLY WELL FASTEND ON I PULLD OUT THE TROCART AND DREW FOUR OR FIVE OUNCES OF SEROSITY OF A BROWNISH WHITE OR THE 270 THE COLOUR OF PALE WHITEWINE AND SOMEWHAT FOUL AFTER WHICH I CLOSED THE CANULA WITH ITS STOPPLE C BY CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS THIS LIQUOR WAS FOUND TO BE NEITHER ACID NOR ALCALINE BEING PUT ON THE FIRE IT EVAPORATED QUITE AWAY AND LEFT AT BOTTOM A FROTHY NEUTROSALINE SEDIMENT SATURDAY OCT 24 I UNSTOPPD THE CANULA AND DREW THE SAME QUANTITY OF WATER THE INFANT WAS ILL ON THE SUNDAY WHEREFORE I DID NOT DISTURB HIM THAT DAY MONDAY THE 26 HE WAS BETTER I DREW FIVE MORE OUNCES OF WATER TUESDAY I SUFFERD HIM TO TAKE REST EVERY TIME THAT I MADE THIS EVACU ATION I BOUND THE HEAD WITH A STRONG CAPELINE  NOTWITHSTANDING THESE PRECAUTIONS THE INFANT DIED IN THE NIGHT BETWEEN TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AND IT WILL PRESENTLY APPEAR THAT THIS HYDROCEPHALUS WAS OF AN INCURABLE SORT I OPEND IT AND FOUND THE BRAIN APPLIED AGAINST THE DURA MATER AS USUAL BUT THIS BRAIN WAS THIN AND AS IT WERE SPREAD OUT IT ONLY FORMED A KIND OF THIN SACK FILLD WITH WATER I OPEND AND SAW THAT THE DISEASE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN AN EXCESSIVE DILATATION OF THE TWO LATERAL VENTRI CLES BY THE WATERS COLLECTED THEREIN THE GLANDULA PINEALIS WAS ALMOST WASTED AS WELL AS THE PLEXUS CHOROIDES OF WHICH SOME FEW VESTIGES ONLY REMAIND ON THE CONTRARY THE OTHER VESSELS WHICH LINED THE INSIDE OF THIS SACK WERE VERY VISIBLE AS THE BRAIN IS A SOFT VISCUS WITHOUT ELASTICITY IT MANIFESTLY APPEARS THAT IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY RESUME ITS NATURAL FORM HOW SLOWLY SOEVER I HAD EVACUATED THE  A BANDAGE PECULIAR TO THE HEAD271 THE WATERS BUT PERHAPS THE OPERATION WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IF THE SEAT OF THE DROPSY HAD BEEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRAIN HOWEVER THAT BE THIS TROCART TO ME SEEMS USEFUL FOR SEVERAL OPERATIONS AND THIS IS MY FIRST MOTIVE FOR PRESENTING IT TO THE ROYAL SO CIETY MY SECOND MOTIVE FOR SO DOING IS THE CONSE QUENCES WHICH MAY BE DEDUCED FROM THIS OBSERVA TION WITH REGARD TO THE APOPLEXY HOW CAN ONE BELIEVE THAT THE APOPLEXY IS CAUSED BY THE EXTRAVASATION OF THE LIQUIDS OR BY THE FULLNESS OF THE VESSELS AFTER HAVING SEEN A BRAIN FILLED WITH WATER AND DISTENDED SO VASTLY AS THIS WAS WITHOUT ANY ONE APOPLECTIC SYMPTOM VERDUC WHO IN HIS PATHOLOGY PROPOSES AN OBJECTION SIMILAR TO THIS AGAINST HIS OWN SYSTEM ENDEAVOURS TO SOLVE IT BUT HAS NOT SUCCEEDED THE OBJECTION REMAINS VICTORIOUS NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE BRAIN OF A PERSON DEAD OF AN APOPLEXY IS OPEND AND EXTRAVASATED BLOOD IS FOUND IN IT HIS DEATH IS IMPUTED TO THIS EXTRAVA SATION ALONE AND THE APOPLEXY IS PRONOUNCED SAN GUINEOUS THIS HAS HAPPENED ON THE DEATH OF M DE FREQUIENNE PRESIDENT OF OUR PARLIAMENT ON OPEN ING HIM I FOUND ABOUT A TEASPOON FULL OF BLOOD EX TRAVASATED WITHIN THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH VENTRICLE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LATTER COULD SO SMALL A QUANTITY OF BLOOD PRESS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE NERVES SO AS TOTALLY TO INTER CEPT THE COURSE OF THE SPIRITS NO CERTAINLY FOR THIS WOULD BE MISTAKING THE EFFECT FOR THE CAUSE THIS EXTRAVASATED BLOOD WAS BUT AN ACCIDENT OWING TO THE CONVULSIVE MOTIONS OF THE DURA MATER AND OF THE VESSELS OF THE WHOLE BASIS OF THE SCULL SEIZED WITH THE APOPLECTIC DISORDER WHICH MOST COMMONLY IS NOTHING272 NOTHING ELSE BUT THE MATTER OF THE GOUT OR RHEUMATISM FIXING ON THIS SOURCE OF THE NERVES NOW THIS GENE RAL ATTACK WHICH SWELLS AND DISTENDS THE DURA MATER THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE BASIS MAKES THE BLOOD STAG NATE IN THE VESSELS SOME OF THE WEAKEST OF WHICH BURST AND AT THE SAME TIME CLOSES ALL THE CANALS OF THE NERVES AND CONSEQUENTLY KILLS THE PATIENT UN LESS A PERSON WOULD CHUSE TO SAY THAT THOSE BROKEN CANALS WERE THOSE WHICH CONCURRED IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BRAIN TO THE FORMATION OF THE SPIRITS THAT GIVE MOTION TO THE HEART WHICH OPINION IS NOT FREE FROM DIFFICULTIES SINCE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THIS ORGAN RE CIEVES THE INFLUENCES OF SEVERAL NERVES AT A TIME ALL WHICH OUGHT TO BEAR THEIR PART IN THIS ACCIDENT WHICH AFTER ALL IS BUT THE RUPTURE OF A SIMPLE CA PILLARY VESSEL THE DRIFT OF THESE REFLECTIONS IS TO ENGAGE PRAC TITIONERS TO HAVE SOMEWHAT LESS CONFIDENCE IN THEIR THEORIES AND FOR EXAMPLE NOT TO MAKE A POOR APO PLECTIC PATIENT DIE UNDER THE LANCET A THING WHICH I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL TIMES FROM THE NOTION WHICH THEY HOLD THAT IT IS THE OVERGREAT QUANTITY OF BLOOD THAT KILLS FOR BESIDES THAT THIS FALSE OPINION IS FATAL TO THIS PATIENT IN PARTICULAR IT WILL STILL BE SO TO ALL FUTURE APO PLECTICS IF THE PREJUDICE IN FAVOUR OF THIS THEORY BE SUCH AS TO PREVENT SEEKING THE TRUE CAUSES AND THE REAL REMEDIES OF THE APOPLEXY XLI

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1010745,WHAT PROVISIONS OF THE DINGLEY TARIFF REQUIRE REVISION,I242593,WHAT PROVISIONS OF THE DINGLEY TARIFF REQUIRE REVISION BY ALBERT CLARKE SECRETARY OF THE HOME MARKET CLUB AND FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION FOR THREE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING DEMAND FOR A REVISION OF THE TARIFF AND NOW THAT THE OCCASION IS RIPER THAN IT WAS REVISION HAS BEEN AGREED UPON AND THE PRELIMINARY WORK BEGUN I HAVE BEEN TRYING ALL THE WHILE TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATE REVISIONIST FILE A BILL OF PARTICULARS BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS EXCEPT THAT A FEW HAVE SAID THE IRON AND STEEL DUTIES ARE TOO HIGH WOOL AND WOOLENS REQUIRE OVERHAULING THE LUMBER PULP AND PAPER DUTIES SHOULD BE REPEALED OR REDUCED ALL IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS SHOULD BE PUT IN THE FREE LIST AND RECIPROCITY SHOULD BE PROMOTED MOST OF THESE SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN GENERAL TERMS AND BY MEN NOT ENGAGED IN THE INDUSTRIES PROPOSED TO BE AFFECTED THE TIME IS NOW AT HAND WHEN SUGGESTIONS MUST BECOME DEFINITE TO BE OF ANY VALUE THE REPUBLICANS HAVING RESOLVED TO MAINTAIN THE POLICY OF PROTECTION AND THE SENATE BEING ASSUREDLY REPUBLICAN FOR FOUR YEARS IT IS EASY TO PROGNOSTICATE THAT WHATEVER THE DEMOCRATIC POLICY MAY BE THIS ARTICLE IS WRITTEN PRIOR TO THE DENVER CON VENTION THE REVISION THAT WILL TAKE PLACE WILL SEEK TO READJUST DUTIES AND REGULATIONS BRINGING THEM UP TO DATE RATHER THAN TO ENTER UPON ANY CHANGE OF POLICY ALL THE FREE TRADERS AND MANY PROTECTIONISTS HOWEVER THINK THERE SHOULD BE A GENERAL REDUCTION AND FEW OR NO INCREASES INVESTIGATION HAS CONVINCED ME THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO BE DISAPPOINTED IF CONGRESS CARRIES OUT THE REPUBLICAN PROMISE AND THIS BECAUSE OF FACTS WHICH I WILL PROCEED TO STATE THE PRESENT TARIFF WAS ENACTED IN I897 EXCEPT IN ONE OR TWO CASES OF THE ACCUMULATION OF SEVERAL YEARS SUPPLY OF IMPORTED PRODUCTS UNDER ITS PREDECESSOR IT WAS IN NORMAL OPERATION BY I900 THE TEST OF A TARIFF AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT IS TOO HIGH OR NOT SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTIVE IS SEEN IN THE IMPORTS OF A SERIES OF YEARS 271THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETING IMPORTS

274REQUIRED REVISION OF DINGLEY TARIFF THE TABLE SHOWS THAT BEFORE THE PANIC OF OCTOBER I907 THERE WAS A STEADY AND IN MANY CASES A LARGE INCREASE IN IMPORTS IT COVERS MORE THAN THREEQUARTERS OF THE TOTAL DUTIABLE IMPORTS IT PROVES CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE DUTIES ARE FAR FROM PROHIBITORY AND THAT IN SOME CASES THEY ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECTIVE IF PROTECTION IS TO BE THE POLICY OF THE COUNTRY SOME INCREASE WAS NATURAL OWING TO GAIN IN POPULATION AND PURCHASING POWER BUT DOMESTIC INDUSTRY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO MEET MOST OF THE INCREASING DEMAND HENCE CONGRESS WILL NATURALLY TAKE EACH CASE OF LARGE INCREASE AND INQUIRE WHETHER OR NOT THE PROSPERITY OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF THE ARTICLE HAS BEEN AFFECTED ANTICIPATING THAT INQUIRY I HAVE BY CIRCULAR ASKED ONE THOUSAND MANUFACTURERS AND MERCHANTS WHAT TARIFF CHANGES THE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR OWN BUSINESS SUGGESTS IN REPLYING A FEW HAVE FOLLOWED THE VOGUE OF THE LAST THREE YEARS AND IN GENERAL TERMS RECOMMENDED REDUCTION ALL ALONG THE LINE GIVING NO SPECIFIC REASONS FOR IT AND NOT CONFINING THEMSELVES TO THEIR OWN BUSINESS THIS OF COURSE IS NOT HELPFUL MANY HOWEVER PARTICULARIZE AND IN MOST CASES SHOW THAT PRESENT DUTIES SHOULD BE INCREASED OR THE CLASSIFICATION OR BASIS OF COMPUTATION CHANGED OR THAT CUSTOMS REGULATIONS SHOULD BE MODIFIED SO AS TO EFFECTUATE AND NOT DEFEAT THE LAW THIS INFOR MATION LIKE THE FOREGOING TABLE WILL DOUBTLESS BE A GREAT SURPRISE TO MOST OF THOSE WHO HAVE CALLED FOR REDUCTION AND YET NO HONEST PROTECTIONIST CAN IGNORE OR LIGHTLY CONSIDER IT BECAUSE IT IS THE RESULT OF EXPERIENCE AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE I WILL SPECIFY SOME OF THE CHANGES THUS FAR SUGGESTED I LITHOGRAPHS INCLUDED IN BOOKS MUSIC ETC IN THE FORE GOING TABLE THE IMPORTATION HAS DOUBLED IN SEVEN YEARS ALTHOUGH OUR PEOPLE ARE AMPLY EQUIPPED TO MEET THEIR OWN NEEDS THERE IS AN OBVIOUS INCONGRUITY IN THE DUTY OF 20 CENTS A POUND ON PAPER NOT EXCEEDING OO8 OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS AND ONLY 8 CENTS ON PAPER BETWEEN 0O8 AND 020 EXCEEDING 35 SQUARE INCHES IN SIZE AND LESS THAN 400 SQUARE INCHES FOR SHOW CARDS I6 X 24 OF THE FIRST CLASS WEIGHING IOO POUNDS PER IOOO BEAR A DUTY OF 20 WHILE AN EQUAL NUMBER AND SIZE ON A SLIGHTLY HEAVIER PAPER SAY OOG OF AN INCH THICK WEIGHING 112 POUNDS BEAR A DUTY OF ONLY 896 THEN IF THE SIZE IS CHANGED TO 416 SQUARE INCHES THE DUTY IS AD VALOREM THERE ARE NO TECHNICALITIES IN THE BUSINESS WHICH CALL FOR THESE DISTINC TIONS CONGRESS CAN EASILY SUBSTITUTE A COMPOUND DUTY WHICH WILL 275 IITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BE SIMPLER AND MORE EFFECTIVE THE WAGE OF A SKILLED LITHOGRAPHER IN GERMANY IS ABOUT 30 MARKS 7I4 A WEEK SIMILAR WORK HERE COMMANDS 2200OO TO 50OO 2 BRUSHES IT WILL BE SEEN BY THE TABLE THAT THE IMPORT HAS INCREASED 60 PER CENT UNDER PRESENT DUTIES A WESTERN MANUFAC TURER WRITES THAT HIS STRONGEST COMPETITORS ARE NOW THE JAPANESE THEIR WAGES DO NOT AVERAGE MORE THAN 25 CENTS A DAY WHILE HE PAYS AN AVERAGE OF I55 CLEARLY THE DUTIES NEED RAISING IF LABOR IS TO BE PROTECTED AND CERTAINLY I55 A DAY IS NOT TOO MUCH WHERE SKILL IS INVOLVED AN EASTERN MANUFACTURER WRITES THAT IMPORTS ARE ONEFOURTH OF THE COUNTRYS SUPPLY HE THINKS THAT INSTEAD OF BEING REDUCED THE DUTY SHOULD BE RAISED TO 50 PER CENT FOR PROTECTION AGAINST EUROPE ALONE IT IS NOW 40 3 BRUSH FIBRES TAMPICO OR ISTLE IS NOW IN THE FREE LIST AND SHOULD REMAIN THERE BECAUSE IT IS NOT PRODUCED IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS DRESSED IN THIS COUNTRY BY MACHINERY MADE AT BURLINGTON VT WHICH DOES BETTER THAN HAND WORK AND AT ONEHALF THE EXPENSE THIS INDUSTRY IS PROTECTED PARTIALLY BY A DUTY OF 20 PER CENT IT HAS RECENTLY TRANSPIRED HOWEVER THAT IN ENGLAND THE PURCHASERS OF THIS MACHINERY CANNOT AFFORD TO OPERATE IT ALTHOUGH THE WAGE PAID IS ONLY ONEHALF THAT PAID HERE BECATSE OF THE COMPETITION FROM GERMANY AND BELGIUM WHERE WAGES ARE SO MUCH LOWER DO THESE FACTS SUGGEST LOWER OR HIGHER DUTIES IN THE UNITED STATES 4 COTTON MANUFACTURES WITH A LARGER AND BETTER EQUIP MENT IN THIS COUNTRY THAN EVER BEFORE SEVENTYTHREE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COTTON GOODS WERE IMPORTED LAST YEAR THE TABLE SHOWS GREAT INCREASES OF NEARLY ALL KINDS THUS FAR NOT ONE MANUFACTURER OR MERCHANT HAS SPECIFIED TO ME A DUTY THAT HE THINKS CAN BE REDUCED WITH SAFETY BUT TWO HAVE SAID THAT THE COARSE GOODS WOULD SUFFER LEAST FROM IT LACES EDGINGS EMBROIDERIES AND FANCY WEAVES ARE THE NEWEST DOMESTIC COTTON MANUFACTURES AND THEY HAVE TO COMPETE WITH ALMOST THE CHEAPEST LABOR IN EUROPE THIS COMPETITION HAS PRACTICALLY DOUBLED IN THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS THE SAME IS TRUE OF COTTON KNIT GOODS ESPECIALLY UNDER THE NEW ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH GERMANY AND FRANCE YET PRICES HAVE NOT INCREASED CORRESPONDINGLY WITH THE PRICES OF RAW COTTON AND OTHER SUPPLIES AND WITH WAGES LAST YEARS IMPORT OF COTTON MANUFACTURES EQUALED THE TOTAL 276 12REQUIRED REVISION OF DINGLEY TARIFF PRODUCTION OF THREE OF THE LARGEST COTTON MANUFACTURING CITIES IN THIS COUNTRYFALL RIVER LOWELL AND NEW BEDFORD IT NEARLY EQUALED THE PRODUCT OF MAINE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND RHODE ISLAND COMBINED IT SURPASSED THE PRODUCT OF ALL THE SOUTHERN STATES EX CEPT THE TWO CAROLINAS AND OF ALL THE MIDDLE AND WESTERN STATES COMBINED IT IS A TREMENDOUS FACT TO BE RECKONED WITH AND AS COTTON MACHINERY HAS BEEN VERY LARGELY INCREASED DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN ENGLAND GERMANY ITALY AND JAPAN AND THE COST OF OCEAN TRANSPORTATION IS SO SMALL AS TO AFFORD LITTLE OR NO PROTECTION WHAT CHANGES IN OUR DUTIES DO THESE FACTS SUGGEST 5 CLOCKS AND WATCHES THE INTRODUCTION OF AMERICAN MACHINERY IN EUROPE HAS NATURALLY RESULTED IN AN INCREASED IMPORT OF WATCHES SALES OF CERTAIN AMERICAN WATCH MOVEMENTS ABROAD AT LOWER THAN HOME PRICES AND THEIR REIMPORTATION FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES AS IS CLAIMED BY DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS HAVE CREATED SOME PUBLIC DEMAND FOR LOWER DUTIES THE GREAT WALTHAM WORKS ARE NOW CLOSED FOR WANT OF ORDERS DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS HAVE NOT YET INDICATED WHAT IF ANY CHANGES IN DUTIES ARE NEEDED PRICES ARE SO LOW THAT EVERY CITIZEN CAN OWN A GOOD WATCH IF HE IS IN THE LEAST THRIFTY 6 CORUNDUM NEARLY ALL THE PURE CORUNDUM THAT IS USED IN THIS COUNTRY COMES FROM CANADA AND PAYS A DUTY OF 20 A TON WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE FOR THE PROTECTION OF A PATENTED ARTIFICIAL PRODUCT WHICH IS SAID TO BE MARKETED UNDER RESTRICTIONS THAT AMOUNT TO FAVORITISM A MANUFACTURER OF GRINDING WHEELS THINKS THE PRESENT DUTY A MISAPPLICATION OF PROTECTION 7 FIBERS AND MANUFACTURES OF THE LARGE INCREASE IN THE IMPORT OF JUTE BAGGING BAGS AND BURLAPS DOES NOT SEEM TO CAUSE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS TO ASK FOR A CHANGE OF DUTIES BUT PROBABLY THE ANOMALY OF THE SITUATION WILL OF ITSELF CALL FOR INVESTIGATION BY CONGRESS 8 HIDES OF CATTLE THE AGITATION OF THIS SUBJECT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO QUIETED DOWN AFTER THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS IN CONGRESS GAVE NOTICE TO THE SHOE MANUFACTURERS THAT THEY WOULD NOT CONSENT TO A REPEAL OF THE 15 PER CENT DUTY WITHOUT A GUARANTY OF REDUCTION IN THE PRICES OF SHOES AS THE SHOE AND HARNESS INDUSTRIES HAVE GREATLY PROSPERED THE DUTY IS NOT CONSIDERED A SERIOUS BURDEN AND THE AGITATION FOR ITS REPEAL WAS LARGELY POLITICAL ONE OF THE 277 13THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WORST EFFECTS OF THE DUTY GROWS OUT OF THE DRAWBACK ON EXPORTED LEATHER THE FOREIGN BUYER DEMANDS AND USUALLY GETS A CONCESSION OF THE WHOLE OR A PART OF THIS DRAWBACK AND THUS HAS AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE DOMESTIC BUYER A LARGE MANUFACTURER OF SHOES SUGGESTS THAT IF THE DUTY CANNOT BE REPEALED THE DRAWBACK HAD BETTER BE 9 IRON AND STEEL THE GREATEST DEMAND FOR REVISION HAS BEEN DIRECTED AGAINST THE IRON AND STEEL SCHEDULE IT IS THE CAUSE OF THE AGITATION CARRIED ON BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS WHICH IS DOMINATED BY THE VEHICLE AND IMPLEMENT AND AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY MANUFACTURERS AND SOME OTHER LARGE CONSUMERS OF IRON AND STEEL THEY CLAIM THAT BY REASON OF THE DUTY OR OF COMBINATION OR BOTH THE IRON AND STEEL PRODUCERS HAVE BEEN MAKING EXCESSIVE PROFITS ALTHOUGH THEIR CALCULATIONS DO NOT ALLOW FOR THE COST OF DEVELOPING MINES AND TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF NEW FOR OLD PROCESSES NEITHER HAVE THEY GIVEN THE PRODUCERS CREDIT FOR MAINTAINING STEADY PRICES DURING A PERIOD OF GREAT AND INCREASING DEMAND WHEN HIGHER PRICES COULD HAVE BEEN EXACTED IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT EFFECT THE REDUCTION IN PRICES ON SHEET AND TIN PLATES WHICH WAS MADE EARLY IN THE YEAR AND ON IRON ORE BILLETS SHEET BARS PLATES STRUCTURAL IRON MERCHANT PIPE AND WIRE NAILS WHICH WAS MADE ON THE 9TH OF JUNE WILL HAVE ON THE DEMAND FOR A REDUCTION OF DUTIES THE ABOVE TABLE HOWEVER SHOWS CONSIDERABLE GAINS IN IMPORTS OF NEARLY ALL IRON AND STEEL SHAPES AND AS THERE ARE EUROPEAN SYNDICATES FORMED FOR THE PUR POSE OF AGGRESSIVE EXPLOITATION OF FOREIGN MARKETS CHANGES SHOULD COME ONLY AFTER EXHAUSTIVE INQUIRY IF AT ALL ALTHOUGH THE LARGEST CORPORATION IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN FORMED IN THIS INDUSTRY DOMESTIC COMPETITION AND FOREIGN COMPETITION HAVE BOTH INCREASED UNDER PRESENT DUTIES AND IF THE DUTIES ARE REDUCED THE DOMESTIC COMPETITORS OF THE SOCALLED TRUST WILL BE LIKELY TO SUFFER MORE THAN THE TRUST ITSELF THIS WAS THE TESTIMONY OF MANY INDE PENDENT MANUFACTURERS BEFORE THE INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION THE FORCE OF THIS DOMESTIC COMPETITION WHICH IS CLAIMED AS ONE OF THE TRIUMPHS OF THE PROTECTIVE POLICY IS SEEN IN THE RECENT REDUCTION IN PRICES THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT AMERICAN INDUSTRIES WHETHER COMBINED OR NOT WHICH CAUSE AN ECONOMIC PRICE BY LARGE DEVELOP MENT AND BY CONCESSIONS TO NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS ARE OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE COUNTRY THAN ANY POSSIBLE BENEFITS DERIVABLE FROM ABROAD 278 14REQUIRED REVISION OF DINGLEY TARIFF IO OIL MINERAL IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED NOT FROM THE INDUS TRIES BUT BY TARIFF REFORMERS THAT A FRAUD WAS PERPETRATED UPON THE COUNTRY BY ADDING AN EXCEPTION TO THE MINERAL OIL CLAUSE IN THE FREE LIST MAKING THE IMPORT DUTIABLE WHEN IT COMES FROM A COUNTRY WHICH PUTS A DUTY ON OUR OIL THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE PROOF OF ANY FRAUDULENT INTENT AND THE REASONABLENESS OF THE EXCEPTION IS EVIDENT THE IMPORT OF DUTIABLE OIL THOUGH SMALL HAS LARGELY INCREASED AND THERE IS A MUCH LARGER IMPORT OF FREE OIL WHICH SHOWS THAT THE CLAIM THAT ONLY ONE COUNTRY COULD SEND IT TO US IS NOT TRUE IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY IS NOT THE ONLY DOMESTIC PRODUCER AND THAT IF IT WERE IT IS ENTITLED TO JUSTICE THE RELATIVE SMALLNESS OF THE IMPORT TO THE DOMESTIC PRODUCT HOW EVER MAKES THE DUTY TOO SMALL TO TALK ABOUT 11 PAPER AND PULP THE UNFINISHED HEARING BY THE MANN COMMITTEE WENT FAR ENOUGH TO CONVINCE THE MAJORITY THAT THE DUTY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADVANCE IN PRICE AND THAT IF IT WERE REPEALED OR REDUCED FOREIGN EXPORTERS AND NOT DOMESTIC CONSUMERS WOULD GET THE BENEFIT THE DEMAND FOR REPEAL WAS MADE BY WELLKNOWN ADVOCATES OF FREE TRADE WHO HAD BECOME OFFICERS OF THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION AND ALTHOUGH THE ASSOCIATION GAVE THEM AUTHORITY TO ATTACK THE DUTY THE FACTS HAD NOT THEN BEEN DEVELOPED AND MANY OF THE MEMBERS NOW SUSTAIN THE COMMITTEES FINDING IN THE GENERAL REVISION THERE MAY BE SOME CHANGE IN THE DUTIES BUT NO CHANGE IS PROBABLE WHICH WILL AIM A BLOW AT THE PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRIES 12 SILK NOT ONE RECOMMENDATION HAS BEEN RECEIVED FOR MODIFYING THE SILK DUTIES ALTHOUGH THE IMPORT IS STILL LARGE THE DOMESTIC PRODUCT HAS STEADILY INCREASED AND BECOME SO VARIEGATED THAT ONLY SPECIAL PATTERNS NOW NEED TO BE BROUGHT FROM ABROAD IT IS A TESTIMONY AT ONCE TO THE WISE ADJUSTMENT OF THE DUTIES AND TO THE ENTERPRISE AND SKILL OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS THAT THIS IMPOR TANT INDUSTRY IS SO WELL ESTABLISHED AND SO PROSPEROUS AND THAT ITS PRODUCTS ARE SO REASONABLE IN PRICE THAT NO DEMAND SEEMS TO HAVE ARISEN FOR ANY IMPORTANT CHANGES OF DUTY THE INDUSTRY HAS FULLY JUSTIFIED ITS PROTECTION THE VALUE OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCT HAS INCREASED FROM 87298454 IN I890 TO I33288072 IN I905 I3 STARCH THE DUTY I CENTS A POUND APPLICABLE ALSO TO ALL PREPARATIONS USED AS STARCH WAS COLLECTED FOR A YEAR OR TWO AND THEN BY SOME STRANGE RULING IT WAS NO LONGER APPLIED TO TAPIOCA 279 I5THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND SAGO FLOURS WHICH ARE LARGELY USED AS SUBSTITUTES FOR POTATO AND CORN STARCH THE IMPORT OF THESE FLOURS LAST YEAR WAS 5839I 075 POUNDS THE GOVERNMENT LOST ITS REVENUE AND THE STARCH MAKERS LOST THEIR PROTECTION STARCH MAKING IS THREATENED WITH RUIN UNLESS THIS MISTAKE IN ADMINISTRATION IS CORRECTED I4 SUGAR STRICTLY THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FOREGO ING TABLE OF IMPORTS WHICH HAVE INCREASED BECAUSE SUGAR IMPORTS HAVE DECLINED BUT I WISH TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE STILL LARGE OUR SUGAR BEET PRODUCTION HAS INCREASED SO RAPIDLY AS TO INDICATE A CONTINUANCE OF PRESENT DUTIES IN I905 THERE WERE FIFTYONE ESTABLISHMENTS WITH A DAILY CAPACITY OF 35900 TONS OF BEETS THEY WERE LOCATED IN FOURTEEN STATES AND TERRITORIES IN FIVE YEARS THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF 70 PER CENT IN THE NUMBER OF ESTABLISH MENTS I77 PER CENT IN THE CAPITAL IOI PER CENT IN THE NUMBER OF WAGE EARNERS 127 PER CENT IN WAGES PAID AND 233 PER CENT IN THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCTALL THIS IN SPITE OF FREER IMPORTATION OF CANE SUGAR FROM OUR INSULAR POSSESSIONS AND FROM CUBA THE ONLY DEMANDS FOR REDUCING THE DUTIES ARE FROM CONSUMERS OR COMPETITORS AND THEY ARE MUCH LESS INSISTENT THAN THEY WERE A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE THE INCREASING SUPPLY TENDS TO REDUCE THE PRICE I5 WOOD AND MANUFACTURES OF WOOD THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEMAND FOR REDUCTION OR REPEAL OF THE DUTIES ON LUMBER ON ACCOUNT OF THE LARGE ADVANCE IN PRICE AND A FEAR THAT WE ARE TOO RAPIDLY USING UP OUR SUPPLY IT IS NOW ADMITTED HOWEVER THAT THE PRICE IS NOT CHARGEABLE TO THE DUTY FOR IT REMAINED THE SAME FOR SOME TIME AFTER THE DUTY WAS ENACTED AND THAT IF THE DUTY WERE TO BE TAKEN OFF THE PRICE WOULD REMAIN THE SAME WHILE THE DEMAND IS GREAT THE ONLY EFFECT OF REPEAL THEREFORE WOULD BE THAT OUR TREASURY WOULD LOSE THE DUTIES AND FOREIGN EXPORTERS WOULD SAVE THEM IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THIS WOULD SLIGHTLY CONSERVE OUR FORESTS BUT ONLY AT THE EXPENSE OF EMPLOYMENT LOGS FOR BOARDS AND PULP ARE ALREADY ADMITTED DUTY FREE WHERE SCIENTIFIC FORESTRY IS PRACTICED THERE CAN BE A LARGE ANNUAL CUT WITHOUT EXCEEDING THE GROWTH AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTION WHICH THE LEGISLATION SHOULD TAKE RATHER THAN REPEALING THE DUTIES AND TURNING ONE OF OUR LARGEST INDUSTRIES OVER TO CANADA IN I905 THERE WERE IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY 19127 SAW AND FINISHING MILLS WITH A CAPITAL OF 517224128 EMPLOYING 404626 WAGE EARNERS AND TURNING OUT A PRODUCT VALUED AT 580 28O I6REQUIRED REVISION OF DINTGLEY TARIFF 022690 THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE GREAT INDUSTRY OF LOGGING IN WHICH THERE WERE 12494 ESTABLISHMENTS WITH A CAPITAL OF 90454 494 AND EMPLOYING 146596 WAGE EARNERS TO WHOM 66989795 WERE PAID IN VIEW OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INDUSTRY ITS EXISTENCE IN EVERY STATE AND TERRITORY THE MEANS WHICH ARE COMING INTO USE FOR PRE VENTING WASTE AND THE PLANTING THAT IS TAKING PLACE BESIDES THE CERTAINTY THAT A REPEAL OF DUTIES WILL NOT REDUCE THE PRICE THE ONLY RECENT SUGGESTIONS OF CHANGE IN THE TARIFF ARE TO OFFSET ANY EXPORT DUTY WHICH THE CANADIANS MAY PLACE ON LOGS IT CANNOT BE KNOWN IN ADVANCE PRECISELY WHAT FORM THIS SHOULD TAKE I6 WOOL AND WOOLENS THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT SCHEDULE IN THE ENTIRE TARIFF BECAUSE WOOL GROWING MUST BE PROTECTED AND MANUFACTURERS MUST BE ALLOWED AN EXTRA DUTY TO COMPENSATE FOR IT THE PRESENT SCHEDULE IS THE RESULT OF YEARS OF CONFERENCES BATTLES SOME HAVE CALLED THEM BETWEEN THE GROWERS AND THE MANUFACTURERS AND OF LONG STUDY BY EXPERTS AND BY COMMITTEES OF CONGRESS WHILE SOME OF THE MANUFACTURERS WOULD LIKE LOWER DUTIES PARTICULARLY ON CARPET WOOL AND WHILE DEALERS AS WELL AS MANUFACTURERS WOULD LIKE TO SUBSTITUTE AN AD VALOREM DUTY FOR A SPECIFIC DUTY ON HEAVY SHRINKAGE WOOLS SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR GREASE AND DIRT YET THE DIFFICULTIES OF AGREEING ARE SO GREAT THAT MOST OF THEM SAY THEY PREFER A CONTINUANCE OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS TO THE EVILS THAT THEY KNOW NOT OF IN PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE TO COMPETE WITH COTTON GOODS LIKE HOSIERY THE WOOL DUTY IS SAID TO FORCE A LARGE USE OF POOR SHODDY BUT JUST HOW TO REMEDY IT AND STILL PROTECT WOOL IS AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM NOTWITHSTANDING OTHER BRANCHES OF AGRICULTURE HAVE BEEN IN CREASINGLY PROFITABLE AND TEMPTING SHEEP HUSBANDRY HAS HELD ITS OWN AND GAINED MODERATELY AS A RESULT OF PROTECTION THE GAIN WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LARGER ESPECIALLY IN NEW ENGLAND NEW YORK AND OHIO BUT FOR THE DOG NUISANCE AN INCREASE OF SHEEP FOR BOTH WOOL AND MUTTON IS MOST DESIRABLE HENCE IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMERS TARIFF CHANGES OF A DISCOURAGING CHARACTER SHOULD NOT BE MADE THE WOOLEN AND WORSTED MANUFACTURE HAS MADE GRATIFYING PROGRESS IN 1905 THE CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN IT WAS 37086169I THE WAGES PAID 70797524 AND THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT 380934 003 THE LAST ITEM SHOWING A GAIN OF 283 PER CENT IN FIVE YEARS 281 I7THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT WAS EQUALLY MARKED SOME OF THE MILLS NOW TURNING OUT CLOTHS THAT COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH THE BEST MADE ABROAD AND AT LOWER PRICES IT REMAINS TRUE AS DEMONSTRATED BY SENATOR ALDRICH IN 1894 THAT IF THE WHOLE DUTY ON WOOL WERE ADDED TO THE COST OF A FIVE POUNDS SUIT THAT ORDINARILY RETAILS FOR 20 IT WOULD INCREASE THE COST ONLY ABOUT SIXTYFIVE CENTS AND MOST OF IT WOULD BE SHARED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND DEALER I7 WORKS OF ART THERE SEEMS TO BE A MORE GENERAL DEMAND THAN EVER BEFORE FOR A REPEAL OF THE DUTY ON WORKS OF ART IT WAS NOT DESIGNED AND HAS NOT BEEN MAINTAINED FOR PROTECTION BUT FOR REVENUE ONLY ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NOT BEEN GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD SUCH WORKS USUALLY BECOME A VALUABLE POSSESSION OF THE PUBLIC AFTER A PERIOD OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP AND ARE GENERALLY ENJOYED BY THE PUBLIC FROM THE FIRST THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE NO OPPOSITION TO THE REPEAL ON THE PART OF PROTECTIONISTS WHETHER THE DUTY IS REMOVED OR NOT THE LAW SHOULD BE AMENDED SO AS NOT TO EXEMPT ARTICLES INVOLVING A GREAT DEAL OF LABOR LIKE LARGE POLISHED AND ELABORATELY CARVED MARBLE ALTARS NOT ANTIQUES WHICH ARE NOW MADE IN THIS COUNTRY AT MORE THAN TWICE THE FOREIGN LABOR COST AND WHICH ARE MANUFACTURES RATHER THAN PRODUCTS OF INDIVIDUAL GENIUS I8 SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS THE EXEMPTION FROM DUTY OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS GREATLY DISCOUR AGES THEIR PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY ALTHOUGH THE MANUFACTURE HERE IS ABLE TO MEET NEARLY EVERY NEED THERE IS COMPLAINT OF THE INJUSTICE OF REQUIRING AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS TO BE CONDUCTED UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF PROTECTION TO SELL UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF FREE TRADE I9 BETTER ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE TREASURY REGULATIONS EMBRACED IN THE COMPACT WITH GERMANY AND SINCE EXTENDED TO OTHER NATIONS HAVE DEVELOPED STRONG OPPOSITION AND WITHOUT DOUBT SEVERAL CHANGES IN THE LAW WILL BE PROPOSED TO SECURE AN EXECUTION ACCORDING TO ITS PURPOSE THIS SUBJECT IS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL AND SUGGESTIONS WILL NECESSARILY AWAIT THE TESTIMONY OF EXPERTS 20 A CUSTOMS COURT A LEADING NEW YORK BUSINESS JOURNAL HAS RECENTLY PROPOSED THAT A CUSTOMS COURT BE ESTABLISHED SO AS TO RELIEVE THE OVERWORKED DISTRICT AND CIRCUIT COURTS AND SECURE A MORE PROMPT AND EXPERT DECISION OF CASES THAT ARE APPEALED FROM 282REQUIRED REVISION OF DINGLEY TARIFF COLLECTORS AND THE BOARD OF GENERAL APPRAISERS THIS HAS FOR SOME TIME BEEN A GROWING NEED AND CONGRESS WILL BE LIKELY TO GIVE IT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION THE FOREGOING SUGGESTIONS ARE PRESENTED AS INDICATIVE RATHER THAN COMPREHENSIVE ONCE REVISION IS ENTERED UPON THERE WILL BE RECOMMENDATIONS OF MANY SMALL CHANGES SOME OF WHICH WILL UN DOUBTEDLY BE FOUND MERITORIOUS RATES AND REGULATIONS WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ONLY THE DIFFER ENCE BETWEEN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC LABOR COST ARE NOT UP TO DATE WHEN A FOREIGN STATEOWNED RAILROAD CARRIES GOODS FOR EXPORT AT ONLY ONEHALF ITS DOMESTIC RATES IT PRACTICALLY PAYS A BOUNTY TO ITS PRODUCERS FOR EXPLOITING FOREIGN MARKETS WHY SHOULD NOT THAT INDIRECT BOUNTY BE OFFSET BY AN EXTRA DUTY THE SAME AS A DIRECT BOUNTY IS NOW IT IS A PRACTICE FOR RAILROADS AND STEAMSHIPS TO MAKE JOINT RATES ON THROUGH BILLS OF LADING AND THIS HAS CAUSED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF FOREIGN GOODS TO BE DELIVERED THROUGH OUT THE TRUNK AND GULF LINE TERRITORY OF THE GREAT CENTRAL WEST AT A LOWER COST FOR FREIGHT THAN DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES CAN SECURE FOR A MUCH SHORTER HAUL THUS EUROPEAN CROCKERY IS DELIVERED AT ST LOUIS CHICAGO AND ST PAUL FOR A SMALLER FREIGHT CHARGE THAN IS MADE TO THOSE POINTS FROM TRENTON NEW JERSEY THIS PRACTICE MUST BE BROKEN UP OR PROTECTION WILL BE LARGELY NULLIFIED IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO SAY IN CONCLUSION THAT IF THE PROTECTIVE PARTY IS AGAIN INTRUSTED WITH POWER ITS REVISION SHOULD BE BASED UPON FACTS AND NOT UPON CLAMOR RAISED BY THE OTHER PARTY IF THE FACTS DO NOT JUSTIFY REDUCTION BUT CALL FOR INCREASE THE PARTY MUST HAVE THE COURAGE OF ITS CONVICTIONS IT HAS BEEN COMMON TO SAY THAT ONLY PRINCIPLES AND NOT SCHEDULES ARE SACRED SCHEDULES HOW EVER BECOME THE EXPRESSION OF PRINCIPLES AND ARE JUST AS SACRED AS ANY OTHER LAW WHILE THEY LAST RATES MUST BE SUFFICIENT OR PRO TECTION FAILS 283 I9

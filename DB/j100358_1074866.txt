J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074866,CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE,I244469,CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE THE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL AS APART OF SECONDARY EDUCATION  IT WAS WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I RESPONDED TO THE INVITATION OF YOUR COMMITTEE TO PRESENT IN PERSON TO YOUR CONSIDERATION THE PROJECT OF A COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL ALL CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA MAY WELL TAKE PRIDE AND SATISFACTION IN THE EVIDENCES OF A NEW INTEREST IN OUR CIVIC LIFE WHICH ARE MANIFESTING THEM SELVES ON EVERY HAND EVERYTHING WHICH HAS FOR ITS OBJECT THE IMPROVE MENT OF OUR BELOVED CITY MAY NOW COUNT ON A RESPECTFUL HEARING AT LEAST NOT MERELY FROM THE SELECT FEW WHO IN ALL COMMUNITIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMMON WEAL BUT AS WELL FROM THE GREAT MASS OF OUR CITIZENS RICH AND POOR ALIKE PUBLIC INTEREST IN OUR WATER SUPPLY IN OUR GAS SUPPLY IN IMPROVED PAVEMENTS IN OUR PARKS IN OUR CITY ADMINISTRATION IN GENERAL IS GROWING AT AN APPRECIABLE RATE WHILE PUBLIC EDUCATION IS JUST NOW RECEIVING SUCH MARKED ATTENTION IN EVERY BRANCH AS JUSTIFIES THE HOPE THAT ITS INTERESTS ARE TO BE LOOKED AFTER MORE CAREFULLY IN THE FIUTURE THAN THE PAST AS I WAS ASKED TO PRESENT THIS SUBJECT TO AN AUDIENCE COMPOSED BOTH OF EDUCATIONISTS AND OF REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER CALLINGS IN LIFE BROUGHT TO GETHER BY A COMMON INTEREST IN THAT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL PUBLIC QUES TIONS EDUCATION I SHALL PURSUE MAINLY TWO LINES OF THOUGHT CONSIDERING FIRST THE RELATION OF SUCH AN INSTITUTION TO THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN GENERAL AND SECOND ITS RELATION TO THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF THE COMMU NITY AND FIRST AS TO ITS EDUCATIONAL OR PEDAGOGICAL ASPECTS ALL SECONDARY EDUCATION SHOULD HAVE A LIBERAL TENDENCY ITS MAIN OBJECT SHOULD BE TO TRAIN THE PUPILS TO THINK TO AID THEM IN GETTING POSSESSION OF ALL THEIR POWERS AND IN ACQUIRING HABITS OF ORDER NEATNESS PROMPTNESS AND FIDEL ITY IT SHOULD BE REGARDED IN A PREEMINENT SENSE AS A FOUNDATION UPON WHICH THE PUPIL MAY BUILD SAFELY AND RAPIDLY IN THE FUTURE YEARS FOR A LONG TIME MEN THOUGHT THAT THE STUDY OF THE CLASSICS AND MATHEMATICS WAS THE ONLY METHOD OF LAYING SUCH FOUNDATIONS AND EVEN NOW THE INFLU ENCE OF THAT IDEA STILL REMAINS POWERFUL IN THE FIELD OF SECONDARY EDUCA TION  ABSTRACT OF ADDRESS BY PROFESSOR EDMUND J JAMES BEFORE THE EDUCA TIONAL CLUB OF PHILADELPHIATHE SCHOOL REVIEW THIS IDEA DID COMPARATIVELY LITTLE HARM AS LONG AS THE MEDIAEVAL CONDI TIONS OF LIFE IN WHICH THE IDEA ORIGINATED STILL EXISTED BUT WHEN THE MODERN ERA OPENED AND NATURAL SCIENCE WITH ALL ITS WONDERFUL ACHIEVE MENTS STARTED INTO LIFE IT WAS ONLY WITH THE VERY GREATEST DIFFICULTY THAT IT COULD SECURE ANY REPRESENTATION WHATEVER IN OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES OWING TO THE PREVALENCE OF THE IDEA ABOVE MENTIONED THE ADHERENTS OF THE OLD STYLE OF EDUCATION WERE NOT CONTENT WITH PRESERVING IT AS ONE OF THE PATHWAYS TOWARD CULTURESIDE BY SIDE WITH EDUCATION BASED ON MOD ERN SUBJECTSBUT THEY INSISTED THAT IT SHOULD STILL REMAIN THE ONLY ONE THE ATTEMPT WAS OF COURSE PREDOOMED TO A FAILUREAS SURELY AS THE LATER CONTEST OF THE STAGE OWNERS AND STAGE DRIVERS AGAINST THE RAILWAYS BUT IT SERVED TO HINDER PROGRESS FOR A LONG PERIOD NATURAL SCIENCE HOW EVER FINALLY MADE ITS WAY INTO THE SCHOOLS AND A ROAD TO CULTURE WAS CAST UP BASED ON MODERN SUBJECTS THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION REPEATED ITSELF AGAIN IMMEDIATELY THE DE FENDERS OF THE OLD AND THE CHAMPIONS OF THE NEW EDUCATION COMBINED TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER INNOVATIONS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF NATURAL SCIENCE JOINED WITH THE DEFENDERS OF THE CLASSICS IN MAINTAINING THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO ROADS TO TRUE CULTURETHE CLASSICS AND NATURAL SCIENCE AN IL LUSTRATION OF THIS TENDENCY WAS AFFORDED IN OUR OWN CITY A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THE MOVEMENT IN FAVOR OF MANUAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOLS WAS BE GUN THESE TWO PARTIES UNITED IN OPPOSING THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SOCALL ED MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS ON THE GROUND THAT THEIR CURRICULUM COULD OFFER NO SUITABLE INTELLECTUAL TRAINING BUT THE MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT THERE IS STILL ANOTHER ROAD TO CULTURE BESIDES THAT THROUGH THE CLASSICS MATHEMATICS AND NATURAL SCIENCESIN THE NARROW SENSE IN WHICH THE LAST TERM IS SOMETIMES USED AND NOW THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING FURNISHED BY THE COM MERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL AS ONE OF THE LEGITIMATE AVENUES TO EDUCATION MAINTAIN THAT THERE IS STILL ANOTHER HIGHWAY TO THAT STATE OF MIND AND HEART KNOWN AS CULTURE JUST AS THE STUDY OF HUMAN HISTORYAS EXPRES SED IN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OR AS THE STUDY OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD AS IN NATURAL SCIENCE OR AS THE STUDY OF THE PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICAL AND ARTISTIC CREATION MAY LEAD THE CHILD ON TO THE FULLEST DEVELOPMENT OF ITS POWERSONE LINE OF WORK APPEALING TO ONE CHILD AND ANOTHER TO ANOTHER SO THE STUDY OF HUMAN HISTORY AS REVEALED IN THE RELATION OF MAN TO HIS ENVIRONMENT LOOKED UPON AS A MEANS OF SUPPLYING HIS WANTS POLITICAL BCONOMY AND THE STUDY OF HUMAN HISTORY AS REVEALED IN THE DEVELOP MENT AND ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPLEX MACHINERY OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY 578CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE POLITICS AND SOCIOLOGY ARE AS TRULY MEANS OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AS ANY OF THE PRECEDING AND APPEAL TO SOME CHILDREN TO WHOM ANY OF THE FORMER IS WEARINESS OF THE FLESH AND JUST AS THE STUDY OF THE CLASSICS WILL ACCOMPLISH THE HIGHEST EDU CATIONAL RESULT FOR ONE TYPE OF MIND AND THAT OF NATURAL SCIENCE FOR AN OTHER AND THAT OF MECHANICS AND ART FOR ANOTHER SO THAT OF POLITICS AND ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS WILL DO IT FOR STILL ANOTHER AS EDUCATIONISTS WE PLEAD FOR THIS SCHOOL IN THE INTEREST OF THE EDUCA TIONAL ENRICHMENT OF OUR SCHEME OF PUBLIC TRAINING THERE ARE BOYS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO WHOM NONE OF THE EXISTING COURSES APPEAL WHOM THIS COURSE WOULD BE A MEANS OF AWAKENING AROUSING TRAINING EDUCATING TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY ALL OF US BELIEVE THAT A PROPER EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AND THAT THE PERIOD OF SECONDARY ED UCATION IS THE TIME FOR LAYING SUCH FOUNDATION BUT WE CANNOT CONCEDE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE KIND OF PROPER FOUNDATION ON THE CONTRARY JUST AS THE CHARACTER OF THE SOIL AND THE SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE A FOUNLATION WHICH WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR ONE BUILDING ENTIRELY UNSUITABLE FOR ANOTHER SO THE VARIETY IN THE STRUCTURE OF BOYS MINDS IN THEIR TASTES THEIR INHERITED TENDENCIES THEIR AMBITIONS POINT TO THE FACT THAT NO ONE SCHEME OF EDUCATION CAN LAY SUITABLE FOUNDATION FOR ALL BOYS IN THE COM MUNITY VARIETY OF SCHOOLS AND OF COURSES IS IN OUR VIEW ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THE LATENT INTELLECTUAL WEALTH OF SOCIETY THESE COURSES SHOULD ALL BE THOROUGH LIBERAL CULTUREGIVINGAND THERE SHOULD IN THE INTEREST OF EDUCATION ITSELF BE AT PRESENT IN PHILADELPHIA AT LEAST FOUR SUCH SCHOOLS ONE DEVOTED TO LANGUAGE LITERATURE AND MATHEMATICS ANOTHER TO MATHEMATICS AND NATURAL SCIENCE ANOTHER TO THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING MECHANICAL AND ARTISTIC CREATION AND STILL ANOTHER TO POLITICS ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS THE FIRST TWO EXIST NOW IN THE CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL THOUGH IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY WERE SEPARATED THE THIRD IS PROVIDED FOR BY OUR MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS THE FOURTH WE ARE ARGUING FOR AT PRESENT IT IS NOT PROPOSED THAT ANY ONE OF THESE COURSES SHOULD EXCLUDE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE OTHER QUITE THE CONTRARY EACH ONE WOULD CONTAIN NECESSARILY MUCH THAT IS FOUND IN THE OTHERS BUT IT IS MEANT SIMPLY THAT THE VARIOUS COURSES SHALL BE BUILT UP AROUND THE NUCLEI INDICATED IT WILL THUS BE SEEN THAT WHILE WE ARGUE FOR A COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL WHICH SHALL ANSWER THE WANTS OF A NEW CLASS IN THE COMMUNITY WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR A TRADE SCHOOL IN ANY DIFFERENT SENSE FROM THAT IN WHICH THE CEN TRAL HIGH SCHOOL OR THE PRESENT MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS ARE TECHNICAL 5795THE SCHOOL REVIEW OR TRADE SCHOOLS THE OBJECT OF ALL THREE ALIKE IS LIBERAL EDUCATION IS FOUNDATION LAYING THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IN THE SUBJECT MATTER OF INSTRUC TION USED FOR THE PURPOSE MANIFOLD AND COMPLICATED ARE THE CONDITIONS WHICH DETERMINE THE COM MERCIAL PROSPERITY OR DECADENCE OF A CITY OR A COUNTRYAND HE WHO AS SIGNS ANY ONE REASON FOR IT DEMONSTRATES HIS INCAPACITY IN THIS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN INVESTIGATION WITHOUT WISHING TO ASSIGN TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATION WE MAY YET CLAIM THAT IT IS A VERY FUNDA MENTAL CONDITION OF A FLOURISHING TRADE THAT THE DIRECTORS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRYTHOSE SELECTED FEW WHO BY THEIR NATURAL TALENTS AND AC QUIRED SKILL HAVE BECOME THE CAPTAINS AND PRINCES IN INDUSTRY AND TRADE SHALL FIND IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN EFFICIENT ASSISTANCE IN THEIR ENTERPRISES THE AVERAGE MAN AND WOMAN IN OUR SOCIETY WILT NEVER REACH A LOFTIER POSITION THAN THAT OF HIGH PRIVATE BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVEMENT ON THE PART OF GREAT COMMANDERS WHETHER IN WAR OR TRADE DEPENDS PRIMA RILY UPON THE DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE AND EFFICIENCY TO BE FOUND IN THE AV ERAGE PRIVATE IS THERE AN ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR THIS NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY DOES THE DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS ENTERPRISES FIND IT EASY TO FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF ASSISTANCE ASK ANY INTELLIGENT AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MAN AMONG YOUR ACQUAINTANCES I AM NOT TALKING NOW OF COURSE OF CLERKS OR STENOG RAPHERS OR TYPEWRITERS OR BOOKKEEPERSWHOSE BUSINESS IS LARGELY ME CHANICAL THOUGH EVEN IN THIS DEPARTMENT IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT OF FIFTY CANDIDATES FOR ANY FAIRLY RESPONSIBLE POSITION NOT MORE THAN FIVE CAN BE CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE I AM THINKING OF POSITIONS WHICH DEMAND FIDELITY INTELLIGENCE SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SOUND JUDGMENTRESPONSIBLE AND DISCRETIONARY POSITIONS IN OTHER WORDSPOSITIONS IN WHICH INITIATIVE EN TERPRISE AND RELIABLE QUALITIES ARE CALLED FOR I TAKE IT THAT THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION UNLESS PHILADELPHIA EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF BUSINESS MEN IN OTHER CITIES AND OTHER COUNTRIES MY PROPOSITION THEN IS THAT A SCHOOL OF THE GRADE OF THE ORDINARY CITY HIGH SCHOOLSAY OUR OWN CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLEWHOSE CUR RICULUM SHOULD BE MADE UP TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT OF SUBJECTS RELATING TO MODERN TRADE AND INDUSTRYITS ORIGIN DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION RE LATIONS ETCWOULD DO A SUBSTANTIAL SERVICE TO OUR TRADE AND COMMERCE BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PROPERLY QUALIFIED YOUNG MEN WHO ARE SEEK ING THE POSITIONS OF ASSISTANTS IN OUR COMMERCIAL HOUSES 580CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE 58I OF COURSE NO ONE WILL MAINTAIN FOR AN INSTANT THAT SUCH A SCHOOL COULD TURN OUT YOUNG MEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE DETAILS OF COMMERCIAL LIFE AND QUALIFIED TO TAKE POSITIONS AT THE HEAD OF IMPORTANT BRANCHES OF BUSINESSSUCH KNOWLEDGE AND FITNESS CAN ONLY BE ACQUIRED IN ACTUAL BUSINESS LIFE AND THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS BUT IT COULD TURN OUT YOUNG MEN SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE WITH A DEEP INTEREST IN COMMERCIAL LIFE WITH CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GENERAL HISTORY OF COMMERCE WITH SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT OPERA TIONS OF MODERN COMMERCIAL BUSINESS WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF FINANCE WITH A GOOD ENGLISH EDUCATION AND WITH AN AMBITION TO SUCCEED IN COM MERCIAL UNDERTAKINGSIN A WORD A BAND OF YOUTH READY TO ENTER UPON THE WORK OF ACQUIRING BUSINESS EXPERIENCE WITH EAGERNESS AND ENTHUSIASM THE TRAINING WHICH SUCH A SCHOOL COULD FURNISH WOULD ENABLE A LAD TO LEARN THE BUSINESS MORE THOROUGHLY AND IN A SHORTER TIME THAN HE COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT SUCH ADVANTAGES SUCH A SCHOOL WOULD MOREOVER OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN MODERN LARIGUAGES THOROUGHLY SO THAT THOSE BOYS WHO WISHED TO PREPARE THEMSELVES TO REPRESENT OUR FIRMS ABROAD COULD FIND GOOD FACILITIES FOR SUCH EDUCATION THE VALUE OF A COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL TO THE TRADE AND COMMERCE OF A COMMUNITY HAS BEEN AMPLY DEMONSTRATED BY A SOMEWHAT EXTENDED EX PERIENCE IN CONTINENTAL COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPE OF TODAY THE LAW OF COMPETITION IS AT WORK IN THE EXTREMEST FORM THE STRUGGLE OF FRANCE AND GERMANY AND ITALY AND AUSTRIA AND RUSSIA FOR THE SUPREMACY IN EUROPE HAS BECOME SO BITTER AND ALL ABSORBING THAT NO MEANS OF GETTING AHEAD IS LEFT UNUSED THE ORDINARY METHODS EMPLOYED IN THE MILITARY SPHERE ARE STRIKING AND SO WELL KNOWN AS TO CALL FOR NO MENTION BUT THE METHODS IN THE INDUSTRIAL SPHERE ARE NO LESS STRIKING AND FUNDAMEN TALPASSING OVER THE QUESTION OF PROHIBITORY AND DIFFERENTIAL TARIFFSWHICH HAVE BEEN USED IN THE MOST UNSPARING WAYIT IS SUFFICIENT FOR US IN THIS CONNECTION TO DIRECT ATTENTION TO THE EVIDENT BELIEF ON THE PART OF ALL THE NATIONS THAT OTHER THINGS BEING APPROXIMATELY EQUAL THE QUESTION OF EDUCATION IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION AND THAT THAT NATION WILL ULTI MATELY TRIUMPH WHICH SECURES THE BEST EDUCATIONAL RESULTS CONSEQUENT LY SCHOOLS OF ALL KINDS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND DEVELOPED INCLUDING MILITARY SCHOOLS TO TRAIN SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS TO TRAIN FARMERS WHO BY REASON OF INTELLIGENCE CAN HOLD THEIR OWN AGAINST AMERICA AND INDIA INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS OF ALL SORTS TO TRAIN MECHANICS FOREMEN ETC AND FINALLY RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCE TO INDUSTRY COMMERCIAL SCHOOLS OF ALL GRADES FROM THOSE INTENDED TO TRAINTHZE SCHOOL REVIEW STENOGRAPHERS CLERKS SHOP GIRLS ETC TO THOSE FOR THE FUTURE DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS OF GREAT BUSINESS FIRMS IN PROPORTION AS COMPETITION HAS INCREASED AT HOME AND ABROAD HAVE THESE SCHOOLS BEEN MULTIPLIED ONLY WITHIN A SHORT TIME THE GERMNAN GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED IN BERLIN A SCHOOL WHERE YOUTH PREPARING FOR BUSINESS CAREERS IN ASIA COULD LEARN ALL THE LEADING LANGUAGES OF EASTERN AND WESTERN ASIA INCLUDING CHINESE JAPANESE ARABIC AND TURKISH FRANCE HAS DONE MUCH THE SAME AND IN BOTH COUNTRIES THERE IS THE KEEN EST RIVALRY IN PROVIDING FACILITIES FOR THEIR YOUTH TO LEARN THE LEADING MODERN LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN THE WESTERN WORID ESPECIALLY ENGLISH ITAL IAN AND SPANISH BELGIUM WHICH IS SO LARGELY DEPENDENT FOR ITS PROS PERITY ON FOREIGN TRADE IS FOLLOWING RAPIDLY ALONG THE SAME LINE IN GERMANY THE APPRENTICESHIP SYSTEM IN THE BUSINESS HOUSES IS STILL PRESERVED AND THE LAWS ENABLE A PARENT TO HOLD A MERCHANT TO A PRETTY CLOSE ACCOUNT FOR HIS DUTY TOWARD THE APPRENTICE BUT IN SPITE OF THIS FACT THE POPULARITY OF THE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL IS RAPIDLY IN CREASING BECAUSE IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT IT OFFERS A TRAINING FOR WHICH THE APPRENTICESHIP SYSTEM IS NO ADEQUATE SUBSTITUTE MANY MERCHANTS ALLOW YOUTH IN THEIR EMPLOY WHO ARE BOUND TO SERVICE FOR A TERM OF YEARS TO ATTEND THESE SCHOOLS FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS A DAY AND EVEN PAY THEIR TUITION FOR THEM TO BOOT BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER THE EFFICIENCY OF THE BOYS IS VASTLY INCREASED BY IT THE RESULTS OF THESE SCHOOLS ARE EVIDENT NOT MERELY IN THE IMPROVE MENT IN BUSINESS METHODS WHICH HAS GONE ON VERY RAPIDLY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN THESE COUNTRIES BUT ALSO IN THE WORK OF THESE NATIONS IN FOREIGN TRADE YOUTH WHO HAVE SUCH A TRAINING ARE EAGERLY SOUGHT BY ENGLISH HOUSES EITHER IN ENGLAND ITSELF OR IN ENGLISH TRADE CENTRES IT IS A WELLRECOGNIZED FACT THAT GERMAN YOUTH ARE TO AN APPRECIABLE EXTENT SUPPLANTING ENGLISH LADS IN THE GREAT COMMERCIAL HOUSES OF LONDON VARIOUS PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONS APPOINTED TO EXAMINE INTO THE CAUSES OF RECENT INDUSTRIAL DEPRESSION IN ENGLAND AND THE REASONS FOR THE RAPID GROWTH OF GERMAN COMMERCE IN PLACES HITHERTO ENTIRELY SUBJECT TO ENGLISH INFLUENCE HAVE EMPHASIZED THIS FACT AND HAVE FURTHERMORE CALL ED ATTENTION TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THESE GERMAN YOUTH WHO ARE EM PLOYED IN ENGLISH HOUSES SOON SET UP BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES AND BE COME MOST EFFICIENT AGENTS OF GERMAN FIRMS IN THE VERY HEART AND CENTRE OF ENGLISH TRADE THEY ATTRIBUTE THE WILLINGNESS OF ENGLISH BUSINESS MEN TO EMPLOY GERMAN YOUTH IN PREFERENCE TO ENGLISH YOUTH CHIEFLY TO 582CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE 583 THE FACT THAT THEY ORDINARILY POSSESS A MUCH BETTER GENERAL AND SPECIAL TRAINING IT IS A SIGNIFICANT FACT IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THERE IS NOT IN ALL ENGLAND A SINGLE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL WHICH WOULD BEAR COMPARI SON WITH ANY ONE OF A HUNDRED IN GERMANY THE MOST STRIKING TESTIMONIAL TO THE VALUE OF SUCH SCHOOLS TO THE TRADE AND COMMERCE OF THE LOCALITY AND NATION IS TO BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE MOST PROMINENT CONTINENTAL SCHOOLS ARE SUP PORTED NOT BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT BY PRIVATE ASSOCIATIONS OF MERCHANTS AND BUSINESS MEN IN GENERAL OR BY BOARDS OF TRADE CHAMBERS OF COM MERCE AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS THUS THE PARIS CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SUPPORTS THREE SUCH COMMER CIAL HIGH SCHOOLS AT ITS OWN EXPENSE AND CONDUCTS FREE EVENING CLASSES FOR ADULTS IN SPECIAL SUBJECTS THE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOLS CHARGE A CONSIDERABLE FEE AND FUNDS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY PRIVATE SUBSCRIPTION SO THAT THESE ITEMS GO FAR TOWARD DEFRAYING THE EXPENSES OF THE SCHOOLSIN TWO CASES INDEED YIELD A NET INCOME BUT THE GENERAL DEFICIT IS MET BY THE CHAMBER ITSELF THE GREAT SCHOOL AT LEIPSIC IS SUPPORTED BY THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THAT CITY WHILE THE STILL GREATER SCHOOL AT VIENNA IS MAINTAINED BY AN ASSOCIATION OF BUSINESS MEN FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE PROPOSITION THAT A COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL IS DEMANDED IN THE INTERESTS OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS MY LAST PROPOSITION THAT IT IS CALLED FOR IN THE INTEREST OF THE BOYS THEMSELVES THIS IS OF COURSE THE CONVERSE ALMOST OF THE FIRST IT IS PROPER THAT THE COMMUNITY SHOULD PROVIDE FACILITIES FOR THE YOUTH TO GET A PREPARATION FOR COLLEGE OR THE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL IT IS PROPER FOR IT TO PROVIDE FACILITIES TO GET A PREPARATION FOR THE ENGINEERING SCHOOL OR FOR THE LIFE OF THE SHOPS OR THE FACTORIES BUT IT IS NO LESS PROPER FOR IT TO PROVIDE FACILITIES FOR THE YOUTH TO GET A TRAINING IN PREPARATION FOR THE GREAT FIELD OF BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL LIFE IT IS INDEED UNFAIR TO LOOK OUT FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE YOUTH WHO WISHES TO ENTER A PROFESSION OR TAKE UP ENGINEERING AND YET DO NOTHING FOR HIM WHO WISHES TO ENTER A BUSINESS CAREER OF COURSE IN PLANNING SUCH A SCHOOL REFERENCE MUST BE HAD TO THE FAIR CLAIMS OF AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION JUST AS THE CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL DOES NOT UNDERTAKE TO TEACH LAW OR MEDICINE OR THEOLOGY BUT DOES AIM TOI GIVE THAT GENERAL TRAINING WHICH IS COMMON AND DESIRABLE TO THE MEMBERS OF ALL THE PROFESSIONS JUST AS THE MANUAL TRAINING HIGH SCHOOL DOES NOT UNDERTAKE TO PREPARE ITS STUDENTS TO BE CARPENTERS MACHINISTS AND ENGINEERS BUT DOES AIM TO GIVE THAT GENERAL TRAINING WHICH IS COMMONTHE SCHOOL RCVIEW TO ALL THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF SKILLED MANUAL LABOR AND WHICH UNDERLIES THE CALLING OF ENGINEERS SO THE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE TO TURN OUT A COTTON OR WOOL OR GRAIN MERCHANT A BANKER BROKER OR INSURANCE AGENT BUT IT WOULD AIM TO GIVE A TRAINING AND A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE WNICH WOULD BE FOUND EQUALLY USEFUL IN ALL THESE AND SIMILAR OCCUPATIONS THE COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOL WOULD BE EXPECTED TO KEEPIN MIND AS ITS SISTER INSTITUTIONS THAT THE MAN IS AFTER ALL HIGHER THAN HIS CALLING THAT ITS WORK IS EDUCATION AND TRAINING NOT CRAMMING AND THAT ITS PUPILS SHOULD BE FIRST OF ALL HONEST MEN INTELLIGENT AND EDUCATED GEN TLEHMEN AND PATRIOTIC AND PUBLIC SPIRITED CITIZENS AND THEN GOOD BROKERS BANKERS AND MERCHANTSOR RATHER THAT THEY SHOULD BEONE AND ALL AT THE SAME TIME BEFORE CLOSING IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO INDICATE BRIEFLY THE CONTENTS OF THE CURRICULUM OF SUCH A SCHOOL IT SHOULD BE IN MY OPINION AT LEAST THREE YEARS IN LENGTH AND BETTER FOUR THAN THREE ADMITTING BOYS DIRECT LY FROM THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS OF THE CITY AS DO OUR PRESENTHIGH SCHOOLS ACCOUNTING OF COURSE SHOULD OCCUPY A PROMINENT PLACE IT OUGHT TO BE TAUGHT MORE AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE THAN DETAIL IE WITH AN IDEA OF ENABLING THE PUPILS TO UNDERSTAND EASILY ANY SYSTEM WHICH THEY MAY HAVE TO LEARN IN SUBSEQUENT LIFE RATHER THAN TRYING TO MAKE EXPERT AC COUNTANTS OF THEM IN ANY ONE LINE IT SHOULD BE AT ONCE MORE SCIENTIFIC AND MORE PRACTICAL THAN AT PRESENT IT SHOULD BE USED MOREOVER AS A MEANS OF STUDYING COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LIFE IFA MAN UNDERSTANDS THOROUGHLY THE SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTING WHICH A GREAT BUSINESS HOUSE HAS DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF ITS DAILY EXPERIENCE THROUGH YEARS OF WORK HE HAS GAINED AN INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THAT BUSINESS THE BOOKS OF A GREAT RAILWAY CORPORATION FOR EXAMPLE ARE AN EPITOME NOT ONLY OF THE ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS OF SUCH A COMPANY BUT THEY ARE A REFLEX OF THE IDEAS OF THE MANAGERS AS TO SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT QUES TIONS OF POLICY IN REGARD TO TRANSPORTATION THIS SUBJECT OF ACCOUNTING NEEDS MOREOVER MUCH MORE ATTENTION THAN IT HAS RECEIVED THUS FAR WHEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MANAGERS OF A GREAT RAILWAY SYSTEM AFTER MONTHS OF EFFORT TO DO MORE THAN INDICATE IN A VERY GENERAL WAY WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH THE FUNDS BELONGING TO THE COMPANY THERE IS SURELY NEEDED NO ARGUMENT ON THIS QUESTION SIDE BY SIDE WITH ACCOUNTING SHOULD BE PURSUED OF COURSE THE ORDINARY MATHEMATICAL COURSES OF A HIGH SCHOOL EXCEPT THAT SOME ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE APPLICATION OF ARITHMETIC AND ALGEBRA TO THE OPERATIONS OF 584CURRENT EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE 585 COMMERCIAL LIFEINCLUDING OPERATIONS IN COMMISSION AND INTEREST CAL CULATION OF ALL SORTS FOREIGN EXCHANGE ARBITRATION OF EXCHANGE FOREIGN SYSTEMS OF WEIGHTS MEASURES ANL MOTEY INTEREST ON STOCK BONDS AN NUITIES PREMIUMS ETC THE HISTORY OF COMMERCE AND COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS SHOULD ALSO FORM A CONSTITUENT OF THE COURSE THE YOUTH SHOULD STUDY THE ORIGIN AND DEVEL OPMENT OF COMMERCE AND ITS METHODS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES DOWN TO THE PRESENTBOTH AS TO THE ARTICLES WHICH HAVE FORMED THE STAPLES OF COM MERCE AND THE METHODS BY WHICH BUSINESS WAS TRANSACTED COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHYDEALING WITH THE ORIGIN OF AND THE METHODS OF OBTAINING AND PRODUCING THE VARIOUS ARTICLES OF MODERN COMMERCE SHOULD ALSO RECEIVE MUCH ATTENTION THE STUDY OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND THEIR PECULIARITIES IS ALSO IM PORTANT THE YOUTH WHO HAS COMPLETED SUCH A COURSE SHOULD KNOW IN A GENERAL WAY THE VARIOUS PURPOSES FOR EXAMPLE FOR WHICH THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOOL ARE UTILIZEDSHOULD UNDERSTAND WHY A MANUFACTURER OF WOOLEN GOODS NEEDS WOOL FROM A CERTAIN PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR HIS PROD UCT AND WHY THAT PARTICULAR KIND OF WOOL IS GROWN SUCCESSFULLY IN THAT PARTICULAR PLACE HE SHOULD ALSO HE ABLE TO RECOGNISE BY SIGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT GRADES AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRODUCT A CONSIDERATION OF THE MODERN SYSTEMS OF TRANSPORTATION SHOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED IN SUCH A COURSENOT MERELY A HISTORY OF ITS ORIGIN AND DE VELOPMENTBUT AN EXAMINATION OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF RAILROAD AND STEAMSHIP TARIFFS AND THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THEM TOGETHER WITH THE VARIOUS METHODS OF SHIPMENT AND THE LAWS RELATING TO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SHIPPER AND TRANSPORTER IT WOULD GO WITHOUT THE SAYING THAT OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE OFFERED TO PURSUE MODERN LANGUAGES SO THOROUGHLY THAT THE PUPIL COULD SPEAK AND WRITE THEM WITH FLUENCY SO AS TO UTILIZE THEM IN BUSINESS CORRESPOND ENCE IN SUCH A SCHOOL SPANISH SHOULD RECEIVE SPECIAL ATTENTION AS THE POSSIBILITY OF SPREADING OUR TRADE RAPIDLY IN THE SOUTH AMERICAN STATES DEPENDS AMONG OTHER THINGS ON OUR HAVING PROPERLY EDUCATED YOUNG MEN WHO CAN GO INTO THOSE COUNTRIES AND TRANSACT BUSINESS IN THEIR LAN GUAGES TRAINING IN PENMANSHIP AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENCE AND THE CORRECT AND FLUENT USE OF ENGLISH WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS IN SUCH A COURSE WHILE GENERAL HISTORY AND LITERATURE AMERICAN HISTORY AND AMERICAN LITERATURE AND OUR AMERICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM AID POLITICAL ECONOMY SHOULD ALL RECEIVE THAT AMPLE ATTENTION WHICH THEIR IMPORTANCETHE SCHOOL REVIEW IN THE LIBERAL TRAINING OF EDUCATED AMERICAN CITIZENS DENLANDS OPPOR TUNITY SHOULD ALSO BE GIVEN TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO DESIRE IT TO LEARN STE NOGRAPHY AND TYPEWRITING AND OTHER SUBJECTS OF INSTRUCTION REPRESENTED IN OUR ORDINARY BUSINESS COLLEGE COURSES IT IS BELIEVED THAT A CURRICULUM BASED ON THESE IDEAS WORKED OUT IN ITS DETAILS BY COMPETENT EDUCATORS AND PROPERLY TAUGHT BY EXPERIENCED TEACHERS COULD AFFORD A TRAINING WHICH EVERY YOUNG FELLOW WOULD DO WELL TO OBTAIN IF POSSIBLE BEFORE

HUMES SANFORD ROBNSON ALBERT S HUTCHINSON DEAN SAGE JR ARTHUR W MACHEN JR BRUCE WYMAN THE NEBRASKA MAXIMUM FREIGHT RATES Of the questions that complicate the modern economic system none is more difficult than that of the regulation of rates charged by quasipublic corporations and in particular by railroads It would seem to have been of primary import ance that the extent of the power of the State legislature under the fed eral Constitution to regulate the rates charged by railroads within its limits should be settled by the United States Supreme Court but this has not been finally accomplished until the recent case of Ames v Union Pacific R R Co reported in the Chicago Legal News March i9 i898 A Nebraska statute prescribed a schedule of maximurn rates which rates if adopted by the railroad company would have forced the railroad to operate at a loss so far as profits within the State were concerned This statute the court held tunconstitutional on the ground that it worked a deprivation of property without due process of law The decision of the court by Mr Justice Harlan although it has been severely criticised seems to be sound It is consistent with a line of dicta in analogous cases which have themselves been distinguished upon dubious grounds Reagan v Farmers Ioan and Trust Co 154 U S Rep 362 and the conclusion also follows necessarily from the decision in the case of Covinigton  lexington Turnpike Road Co v Sandford i64 U S 578 In the latter case a statute was held invalid which prescribed such rates for the tolls to be charged by turnpikes that the plaintiff a turnpike company would have been deprived of all profits From turn pikes to railroads the step is short The principles which apply are the same and it is noteworthy that the turnpike case was decided largely on the authority of the dicta in the previous railroad cases The argu mnent of those who disagree with the position taken by the Court has been that any State statute properly enacted is due process of law within the meaning of the Constitution and that if it is necessary that a regulation should be reasonable in order to fall within the limits of the police power of the State the question is nevertheless a legislativeNOTES 51 one and the action of the State legislature in regard to it is conclusive Tl his position however is slightly inaccurate In order that a State law may be a valid exercise of the police power it must be reason able anid the decision whether it is reasonable or not is in some case withiin the provinice of the federal courts The question it is true is not one of law but it is a question arising under the Constitution of the United States when the statute causes a deprivation of prop erty and the courts cannlot escape the responsibility of deciding it In dealing with the matter the court is in a position similar to that of an appellate court passing upon the facts found by the jury at a trial in the court below and presumably it can properly hold a State statute invalid only when under no possibility could the statute be con sidered a reasonable police regulation Steenerson v Great vorthern Ry Co 72 N W Rep 7 3 Minn The Supreme Court of the United States has never explicitly stated this rule but it seems to have followed it tacitly in all the cases hitherto decided The principal case at all events falls within the rule TI he Nebraska statute had no ulterior object beyond the express object of securing fair rates which must of course be fair to the railroads as well as to the public anid since the statute if enforced would have been confiscatory or practically so no one could suppose under the circumstances that it was a reasonable reguilation The effects of the decision are as yet problematical So far as the public and the States are concerned it can work little hardship Al though legislatures may chafe under the limitation the puiblic can have no just cause for complainit if railroads are allowed to make reason able profits Ihe chief hardship must fall upon the federal courts in being forced to decide questions which are by nature legislative This evil however may not be so great as at first sight appears for if courts adhere to the rule of holding no statute invalid which is not hopelessly unreasonable they will offer little encouragement for bringing cases of this class before them There may be difficulty if parties accept the suggestion of Mr Justice Brewer in the Circuit Court and bring suits continiually upon statutes once declared unconstitutional in the hope that conditions may have changed since the last decision but in practice it is hardly likely that States will leave unrepealed and unaltered upon the books statutes that have been declared invalid upon the chance that under changed conditions they may again be brought to life The great merit of the decision is in affirmning to railroads their constitutional safe guard against legislative attacks the question which is still left for the court to face is how far it will pass upon the reasonableness of rates imposed by a State when the rates merely limit without virtually destroy ing the profits of the corporation

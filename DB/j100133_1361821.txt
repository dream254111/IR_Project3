Tricolored Redwings Agelaius tricolor located near an artesian well in Madera County California I have been so much interested in another colonySept 1914 NOTES ON A COLONY OF TRICOLORED REDWINGS 205 this year with better opportunities for observation that it seems pardonable to touch upon the subject once more The nesting ground before described CONDOR II November 1900 page 122 was a remarkably crowded one In a patch of tules of very limited extent beside a flowing well the birds had built their nests in such numbers that many were abandoned when other nests were built above them and the tules grew so high and thick as to make the lower tiers dark dirty and inaccessible The colony breeding this year on the Rancho Dos Rios Stanislaus County California was a much larger one than the above but the breeding ground was acres instead of yards in extent While there must have been several thousand birds in it there was plenty of room and no great crowding together of nests though even with so much space there were many nests only a few feet and in some instances only a few inches apart None however were built over others notwithstanding the different heights above the water vary ing from six inches to about three feet the water itself being about knee deep While the writer first noticed signs of building on April 14 1914 it prob ably commenced shortly before that date as the spot had not been visited for several days previously On that day birds were noticed carrying building material and upon further investigation a few beginnings of nests were found As only a comparatively small portion of the tule patch was explored it is very possible that there were some nests not seen on that day that were farther advanced in construction The colony was visited next on April 23 on which date some nests were found to contain their full complement of four eggs some two or three and others still empty but apparently ready for occupancy the majority being those with two or three eggs A few sets were selected from the vast num ber on this day and the next and the eggs were found to be from fresh to slightly incubated with one or two sets about onethird along Another visit was made on April 29 when most of the nests seen on the 23rd and 24th along the paths made by forcing my way through the tules on that occasion contained four eggs although a few held only two or three and some were still empty A small number had hatched out within the last few hours but nests containing young were scarce There appeared to be birds yet building and a few sets seemed to be fresh Among those nests in which incubation was completed the greater number contained from two to four young yet a few held only one Many nests were very poorly constructed and were falling down on one side so much so in fact that the eggs had evi dently rolled out In one such case a poor youngster just hatched out was the only occupant and he was hanging on for dear life with tooth and toenail at the very lowest edge Rapid growth of the tules may have had something to do with the condition of some of these nests but there evidently was a great difference either in architectural ability or constructive energy among the members of the colony In the description of the Madera County breeding ground stress was laid on the fact of so many nests having been abandoned while in this colony but few were deserted and those possibly by the accidental death of the builders and but few were robbed by hawks It seemed however as if the birds must have stolen nests from each other as for instance in the case of one set that was blown and found to be composed of three very fresh eggs and one ex tremely rotten one And in another where one holding the full complement of four was found to be built over a nest already containing four eggs rotten206 THE CONDOR Vol XVI dirty and stained by the damp stuff which had been used to form the bottom of the second nest Our collection that of J  J W Mailliard contained a set of five eggs of A tricolor taken by Walter E Bryant years ago and the writers ambition was fired to find one himself never having been so fortunate in several previous experiences with breeding colonies of this species On this occasion success crowned his efforts and when just about to give up the search wet and tired after the examination of hundreds of nests a five set was discovered Fortunately it was in such state of incubation as to allow of its being saved and as to leave no room for doubt about its being actually one set instead of a combination like the two just mentioned above By the time incubation was completed in the majority of nests and vast numbers of young beaks were opening wide for needed nourishment the barley in the neighborhood was just reaching the pulpy stage being in the milk as it is called when the kernels of grain are much relished by the redwings on their own account and much prized as a food for the young Hence a large amount of damage is done by these birds when the grain is in this state and this keeps up even when the grain becomes quite hard But while thousands of the red wings were visiting the barley fields as many more were bringing in grass hoppers cutworms caterpillars and various sorts of insects in various stages of growth and probably the harm done to the grain is more than offset by the good work of destroying injurious pests of the insect world A few adults were shot in the first week in May at a time when some of the barley was in the most appreciated stage of development to ascertain the contents of the stomachs It happened that those particular individuals at that time of day at least had been more diligent in the matter of hunting in sects than in robbing the barley fields for only two or three grains of barley were found in each stomach the contents of which consisted mostly of insects of several sorts not determined grasshoppers being largely in evidence That however a great deal of barley was consumed was shown by the stripped heads found on the stalks to say nothing of the visual evidence of the flights of birds to and from the grainfields As the youngsters grew larger leaving their nests and perching in the tules the parents became busier and busier supplying food for the rapidly de veloping appetites evidently deeming it necessary to maintain a large propor tion of insect life in the bill of fare judging by the direction from which food was brought and by the action of the parents when collecting the food supplies When some nearby alfalfa fields happened to be irrigated great numbers of the adult birds arrived on the scene and gathered in quantities of fat grubs that were brought to light by the water most certainly doing a beneficial act to the owners of the fields After hunger fear seemed to be one of the first sensations developed in the young nestlings So much was this the case that the youngsters say a week old would flop out of the nests on the approach of a human being and fall into the water It was impossible to force ones way through the tules without making more or less noise and the number of suicides would have been so great if an extended visit had been made to the nesting ground that the writer con tented himself with investigation of the outer edges only during the nestling period not wishing to be responsible for a large and useless loss of life among the juvenile population As the young left the nests and took to the tules their feeling of fear did not diminish and they would flutter or scramble away soSept 1914

scattered many of the young accom panying their parents abroad in search of food Yet there were still some on the original ground which were too young to fly as shown by the number of old birds carrying food to that particular spot Those old enough for flight seemed to return to the tules every night and often for the purpose of finding rest and shade in the daytime as well By July 1 the colony was beginning to disintegrate and even before that date small flocks of old and young together could be seen working toward the north while but few were noticed returning from that direction

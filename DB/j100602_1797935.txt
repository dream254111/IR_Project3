EDWARD RCBINSON of Nezv York Read November 22 1847 THE deep depression of the Dead Sea below the Mediterra nean appears nevel to have been suspected down to the time of its actual discovery and no experiments were ever made to ascertain the true lezel until March 1837 At that time Messrs Moore and Beek in attempting to survey the Dead Sea were led to examine the question of its comparative ele vation by means of some experiments on the boiling point of ater They were greatly surprised at the results whicll in dicated a depression of about 500 English feet A month later in April of the same year Schuberts observations with the barometer gave the depression at about 600 598 5 Paris feett In the following year 1838 tmro barometrical measurements were taken That of Bertou a French traveller gave to the sea a depression of 406 metres or 1332 feet Entlish The other by Russegger a German indicated 1319 Paris feet equal to 1400 feet English The results of similar barometrical measurements for the level of the lakes of Tiberias and the Huleh by Schubert and Bertou exhilJited a still greater diversity The former made tlle depression of the first lake to be 535 Paris feet only 65 feet less than his estimate of that of the Dead Sea yet he made the Jordan at the bridge near the Huleh to be 350 Paris feet above the Mediterranean a difference of t380 Frellch feet in the distance of about 5 miles  15 Bertou on the other hand gave the depression of the Lake of Tiberias at 230 3 metres or 75G feet English being 577 feet less than his estimate of that of the Dead Sea while that of the Huleh according to him is about 1 fS feet implying a fall of 737 feet in the same 5 mlles 1T Such was the state of the question shen the  Biblical Re searches in Palestine were published in 1841

rapidity of the stream and the nature of the country I therefore ventured in that work to suggest that  so great is the uncertainty of all such partial measurements and observa tions as evinced in the like case of the Caspian Sea that the question call never be solved with exactness until the inter rening collntry shall have been surveyed and the relative level of the two seas trigonometrically ascertained  Such a measurement was afterwards understood tz3 have been accorn plished during that very year 1841 by Lieut Symonds of the British Royal Engineers A very slight notice of his re sults avas laid before the Royal Geographical Societ of London at their meeting Janualy 24th 1842t One otthe earliest accol1nts was published in this countly in Julfir 1842 in the following extract of a letter from the Rev Eli Smith to the writer dated at Beirut Sebruary 7th 1842   I am happy to inform you that the altitude depression of the Dead Sea has been ascertained by exact trigonometrical measurement Lieut Symonds of the British Royal En gineers surveyed the greater palt of Judea and the region around the plain of Esdraelon and while doing it carried a dollble line of altitudes from the sea at Yafa to Neby Samvll and thence another double line to the Dead Sea He bund the latter to be 1337 fect below the Mediterranean Bg simi lar observalions he ascertained the Lake of riberias to be 84 feet below the NIediterranean These numbers he gave me himself and at the same time showed me his calculations tThe same statement of the ascertained depression of the two lakes 1337 feet and 84 feet was communicated by M von Wildenbruch the Prussian ConsulGeneral at Beirut to the Royal Geographical Society of Berlin during the same year and published by them in their Monthly Report In May of the same year 1842 the President of the Royal Geogaphical Society of Londond William R Hamiltonr Esq in his annual address delivered before the Society and after wards published in their Jourllalll entered into some details respecting the 1nanner in which the survey had been performed to which we shall have occasion hereafter to recur He also stated the results at 1311 9 English feet fbr the depression of the Dead Sea and 328 Meet for that of the Lake of Tiberias The same distinguished gentleman in his annual address of the following year 1843 and also in his address on delivering one of the gold medals of the Society to Leut Symondss gives  Bibl Re3 ii p 222 t Lond Athenzeum Jan 29 1842 t Bibl Repository June 1849 al80 in Biblioth Sac Feb 1843 p 16  Monatsbericht der Ges fur Erdk zu

this dif ference of level between the two lakes he makes the following remarks which are worthy of grave consideration t  It cannot have escaped fiour notice that there still le mains to be executed in this part of the globe a very important and interesting operation to account for the very great discre pancy of these figures for it follovs from these two ascer tained levels that there is a difEerence of nearly 1000 feet between the Lake of Tiberias and the Dead Sea a distance in direct line of little more than one degree of latitude which implies the Jordall not being a meandering stream a fall of more than 16 feet in every mile of its course This is in itself a very remarkable phenomenon and calls for the early atten tion oftravellers and geographers The river has been fre quently crossed and is always noted as a rapid stream bllt no cataracts or decided rapzds as such have been observed and no one has traced its banks from one of these pOiz1ts to the other It is the purpose of the present paper to draw attention to what Mr Hamilton so justly calls  a very remarkable pheno menon  and by a reference to the ascertained fall of several other rivers in different parts of the glohe to present this phe nomenon in its true light and proportions The way will then be open to bring forward some considerations which may seem to connect themselves with the result The immediate banks of the Jordan as is said above have never been fully traced between the two lakes though tra vellers have passed along the whole length of the valley Bertou in 1837 went from Tiberias to Jericho through the valley and in 1844 the Xev Eli Smith passed up from Jericho as far as to WadyelFaria N of tlle mountain called KurnesSurtubeh A copy of his unpublished Journal is now in my hands rhe river has been frequently crossed at various points and indeed from the Lake of Tiberias as far down as to Beisall may be regarded as well known Irby and lAIangles crossed near that lake and again further down on the route from Om Keis to Beisan and both they and Bertou describe the riner as winding extremely and having little currentt Buckingham relates that in crossing the river 4 or 5

Sea and Jordan Falley Just bele3w Beisan is a ford where Burekhardt crossed in July and found the water 3 feet deep He says the river is fordable in many places in stlmmer but during the rainy season the spots where it may be forded are few Irby and Mangles crossing at the same ford on the 12th of March re mark that the water reached above the bellies of the horses and that the current was here much swifter than in the part nearer the Lake of Iiberiast The same travellers a fortnight later March 29th in passing from EsSalt to Sabulus lost their way and coming to the Jordan were surprised to find it very much swollen The stream was exceedingly rapid and so deep that they were obliged to swim their horses Buck ingham crossing with Mr Bankes some distance above Jericho early in February found the river easily fordable the stream was exceedingly rapid flowing over a bed of pebbles The bathingplaces of the pilgrims opposite Jericho have been often described and the river there runs with a swift strong current but without rapids The same is true of the crossing place visited by my own party further down where I have described the Jordan as having a still though very rapid current so that our Egyptian servant a stout swimmer of the Nile was carried down several yards in crossing The water was here said to be 10 or 1X2 feet deep and the river is never passed at this point without swimming the horses 11 These notices all indicate a swift current of the river below Beisan but still nothing in the nature of rapids It must also be borne in mind that the fordingplaces are always the shallowest spots where the current of course is the swiftest Nor do the Arabs know of arly rapids nor have they ever re ported any to travellers It is however barely possible that something of the kind may exist in that singular tract of the valey opposite to KurnesSurtubeh Frorn the foot of that mountain a higher desert tract of land or low ridge extends across the valley  through which the Jordan finds its way in a deep ravine lndeed in the vicinity of the river the whole tract is broken up into a labyrinth of like ravines with barren chalky sides forming a most wild and desolate scene Burok hardt speaks of the same as  a chain of low calcareous rocky heights S This portion of the rivers course has never been minutely examined though it is obvious that if rapids exist even here they can have no very unusual fall The flow of the Jordan is swift deep and silent its waters  Trav in KSyria c p 344  Trav IcJnd 1845 p 92 t lhidp 99  Trav in Palest 8vo ii pp 92 93 1I Bibl Re3

between the two lakes may be taken at one degree of latitude or 60 geographical miles it beinD actually a little less according to the best maps The diCerence of level between the lakes as ascertained by Lieut Symonds is 984 English feet giving therefore a fall of 164 feet in every geographical mile Let us now compare the known rate of descent in some other of the most rapid streams in the diCerent parts of the world I THE ORONTES Thc elelration of the lake of Antioch above the Mediterranean as ascertained by the English en gineers durin Colonel Chesneys expedition is 36z English feet This lake lies opposite the elbosv of the Orontes where that river turns SVV and the outlet of the lake enters the latter so that the level of the rilrer at the elbow diffters very little if at all from that of the lake The direct course of the Orontes froln its elbow to the sea is about 24 geographical miles This gives an average fall of nearly 15 feet for evcry mile of the course below the bend being nearly equal to that of the Jordan But the stream diSers greatly from the Jordan in its character Below Antioch it passes through a mountain gorge with perpendicular walls shere the river  zoars over its rocky bed in a succession of rapids and shallows which render it unnavigable even for steamvesselsf Further down in the plain towards the sea the river is in some places fordable but is usually crossed by a ferry and the current is very rapid In the following notices of the Elbe the Danube and thc Rhine the measuremellts are taken from Steins Geographtr a popular German work of high

Schandau where the river is still for some distance among the mountains only 1916l 2 feet Yet the Elbe is justly regarded as a very rapid stream III THE DANUBEIt is necessary here to include only that portion of the river which flows among mountains and is the rnost rapid viz between Passau and Venna The eleration of the stream at Passau is 786 German feet at ATienna 480 feet The direct distance is nearly l30 geographical miles The average descent therefore in each mile is 3136  2 3 feet Yet this tract comprises the celebrated Strudel and other rapids formerly so much dreaded by the boatmen Indeed until the introduction of steam nal7igation the boats which descended the Danube were very rarely if ever taken back but were broken up at the end of their voyae IV THE RHINEThiS noble river we may look at in three different sections 1 Between Colog7te and MayenceHere we find the celebrated scenery of the Rhine The river flows between mountains and is a bold and rapid stream The elevation at Mayence is 256 German feet at Cologne l12 feet the distance between the two places nearly 90 geographical miles The average fall therefore is 1944  16 feet in each mile Yet in this tract is the rapid at the Lurle the BingeLochX and others and so powerful is the current that the steamers which descend from Mayence to Cologne in a day for a long time took two days to return Indeed so late as 1827 the time of a steamer from Rotterdam to Strasburg was eight days while the downward trip was made in forty hours 2 Between Mayece ad BaselHere the Rhine pours its waters rapidly with very many windings through the immense plain Its elevation at Basel is 755 German feet at May ence as before 256 feet and the direct distance bAween the two cities about l 58 geographical miles This gives the ave rage deseent of 14959 3 1 feet a mile nearly double that of the straighter and more navigable portion below The very wind ing course of the river honvever serves greatly to diminish the rapidity of the current 3 Betweerz Basel czad tAbe LaAe of Co7tstance At Stein situated at the foot of the lake the elevation is 1200 German feet at Basel 755 feet the direct distance between is abollt 56 geographical miles The average fall is therefore 8 feet in each mile of direct distance But this section of the Rhine is the most rapid in the whole course of that river after it loses its character of a lnountain torrent in the Lake of ConstanceDescent of Danube Rhine AlohawA  Missouri 83 Besides the strong rapid at LauSenburg it includes the cele brated fall of Schaffhausen from 75 to 80 feet ill height If these be deducted the average fall is reduced to 6 feet in the lEIile This portion of thc river is not navigated except by produce boats and these are only Iushed or towed up the current by main strength V THE MOHAWK If it should be said of the pleceding streams that the measurements depend lnerely on thc baro meter and are therefore of doulXful accuracy yet in the pre sent installee such an objection cannot be taken The great Erie Canal runs all the way along the bank of the Mohawk and the measurements are the results of actual levellings and surveys in laying out that great work The elevation of the river at Rome abcove tidewater in the Hudson was found to be 419 English feet8 The direct distancer from Rome along the valley of the Hudson is not less than 95 geogralhical nliles This gives the average fall in each mile at 49159  4 4 feet The Mohawk is everywhere full of ripples and rapids and proba bly every one who has seen the two rivers would regard it as a more rapid stream than the Jordan The above measurement comprises also the falls of the Cohoes having a descent of 70 Meet and the Lttle Falls where the water lescends 4 2 feet in half a mile Deducting these the alrerage fall of the liver is reduced to 3 4 feet in the mile VI rTHe M1SSOURI At the Great Falls of the Missouri 2500 miles above its junction with the Mississippi it is stated that the river descends 357 feet in 18 miles by a succession of falls the greatest fall being 87 feet perpendicular alld the next 47 feett This would give the average descent in each mile not quite 20 feet RECAPITULATION Fall per Mile THE JORDAN without rapids and usually deep  164 feet THE RONTES  roaring over its rocky bed  with shallows            15  THE ELBE above Schandau       2 3   from Schandau

Smitils Gazetteer 1 41684 Dr E ROBINSON on the Dead Sea and Jordan Valley can be compared with the Jordan in rapidity of descent are the Great Falls of the Missouri and the lower part of the Orontes lvhich flows ovel rocks and is unnavigable The Rhine in its most rapid portion and including the fall of SchaShausen has but onehalf the average descent of the Jordan The Mohawk with its many rapids and falls has but onefourth part of the same descent The Jordan so far as known has neither cataracts nor rapids and its flow though swift is silent Wret in the 984 feet of its descent in 60 geogra phical miles there is room for THREE CATARACTS each equal in height to NIAGARA and still to leave to the river an average fall equal to the swiftest portion of the Rhine including the cataract of Schaffhausen  All this suffilciently attests that the descent ot the Jordan7 so far as ascertained does indeed present in the language of Mr Hamilton  in itself a very remarkable phenomenon And it is hardly to the credit of the scholars and learned societies of Western Europe to whom the Holy Land is now brought within an easy journey of a few days that more than four years should already have been sufEered to elapse since attention was thus publicly called to this important problemn without the slightest eSort having been made so far as the public are in formed to arrive at its solution In the absence therefore of all further observations and in view of the striking anomaly thus presented by the Jordan as respects all other like rapid streams I venture to suggest not certainly in a spirit of doubt or want of confidence in the distinguished engineer but solely in behalf of the interests of science whether after all there may not be a possibility that some slight element of defect or inaccuracy may have entered into the observations or calculations and thus have aCected the correctness of the result  The question would seem to be a fair one here between the possibility of some such error on the one side and the probalgility of so immense a contrast lvith all similar physical phenomena so far as known on the other The following account of the manner in which the observa tions were made is given by the President of the Royal Geo graphical Society in his annual address for 1842 and is the only one I have yet seen Lieut Symonds being furnished with an excellent seveninch theodolite  measured a base from the Martyrs Tower near Ramleh on the plain of Jafa on which he founded his triangulation for the south portion of his district and finding the instrument sufficiently nicely divided  Journal of the Royal Geog Society 1842 p 1XSurvey by Triangulcltion S5 in its vertical alc he was enabled to ascertain the relative lexels of his various points with great acouracy He then vorked with his triangulation towartls the head of the Dead Sea taking at every station a very accurate series of vertical angles the mean of which he worked on making the necessary allowances for refraction and curvature but owing to the want of another instrument and a competent person to take simultaneous observations he could not ascertain what the former was and had to assume it at 1 of the subtended angle from the earths centre which he considers to be vcry near the truth Lieut Srmonds completed the levels in this manner by two difEerent lines from JafEa to Nebi Samuel the highest point of the Jerusalem range the one checking the other and found the difFerence but trifling From thence he started on the same plan to the Dead Sea and with nearly as good success the two levels differing from 11 to 12 feet Owint to the unfavourable nature of the ground about Jeru salem and the clifEs overhanging the plains of Jericho Lieut Symonds could not carry the tvwo lines of level independently of each other to the required spot which might have been done in spite of the natural difficulties had he had better assistance than he could procure from Bedouins The work occupied him nearly ten weeks though the distance traversed was not more than 47 miles the direct distance from JalCa to the Dead Sea It appears from this statement that the observations con sisted in a double series of vertical angles connected appa rently at least sometimes with long distances The surxey therefore was not carried on by the process of levelling usually employed in laying out the course of a callal or railroad However cxact therefore the observations may have been in themselves yet no one plobably will suppose that this method of survey would ever be adopted or in any way relied on in undertaking any great public work like a railroadl or canal where the ascertaining of the true level was essential It appears also that the refraction could not be determined but was assumed hypothetically at a certain amount in the calculations The atmosphere in Palestine is dry and singu larly transparent so that objects situated at a great distance appear as if comparatively near at hand It would seem not unnatural that this should have an effect upon the amount of refraction and cause it to be different from that which exists in the more humid atmospheres of England and other countries and this difference it might require a series of careful observa tions to determine accurately Especially would it seem im portant to take into account thc pecllliar degree of refraction86 Dr E ROBINSON on the Dead Sea and Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea and along the Jordan valley where from the greater depression of the surface the atmosphere must naturally be much more dense than in any other known portion of the globe It would seem further that there existed an important discrepancy between the results of the earliest calculations and those subsequently published In tlle statements reported from Beirut to this country by the RelT Eli Smith and to Berlin by 1NI von Wildenbruch the Prussian ConsulGeneral and derived from Lieut Symonds himself the depression of the Lake of Tibelias is given at only S4 feet nz7hile the later publication emakes it 328 feet a difference of 244 feet Tilis would give for the difference of the two lakes 1228 feet and would raise the acTerage fall of the Jordan in each mile to 20 fect How this difference arose we are not informed it may have been by varying some one or more of the assumed elements in the calculation There is another circumstance whch perhaps is hardly of sufficient importance to lSe adduced hele and yet under a certain aspect it is not without soune weight There exists a plan of Jerusalem published by John Wealev Londorl 1844 and marked as  Surveyed by Lieuts Aldrich and Symonds Royal Engineers This plan differs from every other in the form and extent of the Haram area the site of the alleient Jewish temple lhe eastern side of that area according to the independent measurement of Mr Catherwood of Messrs Tipping and Wolcott and of the Rev Eli Smith in 1844 is 1525 feet ill length the plan in question gives it at 1400 feet The southern side of the same area according to the measure ments of the same gentlemen s not less than 912 feet while it is laid down on this plan at only 830 feet the northern end being given at alsout 1060 feet Abolre all the western side of the area instead of being marked as a stlaight line as is done correctly in every plan of Jezusalem from OAnvile to Schultz is here represented as being drawn in towards the southern end by two rectangular offsets one of 10 feet andv the other of 130 feet That no such ofEsets exist is matter of public notoriety to all who have ever visited Jerusalem and it is diScult to understand how such a representation can ever have come to be connected with the names of scientifie engineers NQ doubt the matter can be and perhaps has already been satisfactorily explained otherwise it is easy to perctive that it might have some bearing upon a judgment of the present questioll Taking into consideration all the circumstances thus far adducedX there certainla does seem ground sufficient for theSurvey proposed Elevation of the Bakcl Baalbek 87 suggestion of a doubt whether the problem of the depression of the ILead Sea and Jordan valley is yet fully solved Or if a reexamination should confirm the acouracy of the former results there still remains the  remarkable phenomenon  of the great descent of the Joldan to be investigated and ex plained Either of these objects alone would be worthy the attention of European governments combined as they are they ought not to remain uninvestigated another year It would be a small thing for England or France or Prussia to send out an expedition for this purpose and it flnay be hoped that the Geographical Societies which adorn the capitals of those countries will not let the matter rest until it shall be fully accomplished lzhe survey ought to be conducted in the same method and with all the caution and accuracy usually required in laying out the route of a canal or railway It might be carried across the mountain flom Jafa by Jerusalem to the north end of the Dead Sea or perhaps better from GLaza by way of Beer sheba to the Dead Sea eithel opposite the long peninsula or further south This latter course would avoid the mountains except the descent to the Dead Sea itself The survey ought likewise to take in the course of the Jordan between the two lakes as also the tract between the Lake of Tiberias and the Mediterranean near Haifa lwhese three different routes woulzl mutually check and prove each other In the same connection it would be exceedingly desirable to extend the survey to the upper sources of the Jordan above Hasbeiya and to include also the valleyof the Bukaa between Lebanon and AntiLebanon connecting it with the Mediter ranean on the north of Lebanon and perhaps also near Tyre along the course of the riser Lltany There is here a remark able configuration of the earths surface respecting which we have as yet no accurate knowledge There is here at least one interesting problem yet to be solved in determining the elevation of the Bukaa above the sea From barometrical measurements taken at Baalbek this elevation is given by Schubert at 3572 Paris feet by Russegger at 3496 Paris feetequivalerlt in English feet to 3810 and 3729 feet respectively Near Baalbek rises the Litany which flows south and lvest to the Mediterranean near Tyre Just north of Baalbek is the low watershed in the valley bewond which are the sources of the Orontes which runs north to the parallel of Alltioch and then bends round southwestwards to the sea We have already seen that the  Schuberts Reise iii p 322 Rtlssetger 8 Reise i p 70288 Dr E ROBINSON on the Dead Sea and Jordan Valley average fall of this stream below its elbow is 15 feet in the geographical mile The elevation of its remotest source near Lebweh cannot xary much from that of Baalbek or 3729 English feet taking the estimate of Russegger while we have already seen the elevation at thc elbomr to be 365 feet The diffierence gives the fall of the rixrer between those points at 3364 feet in the lirect distance of nearly 128 geographical miles This is equal to an average fall of 26 4 feet in each mile or nearly double the rate of fall in the same river 15 feet below its elbow This result is quite incompatible with the grcater comparative rapidity of the Orontes in its lover por tion and also with the general features of the country and the extensive marshes along its upper valley The baro metrical measurement of the Bukaa is therefore probably too high The same inference is confirmed by comparing the course of the Litany From Baalbek to the sea its direct course is nearly 55 geographical miles It flows at first along the allu vial valley then breaks through the southern spurs of Leba non by a deep chasm for about 20 miles much of the way over a rocky bed and with a rushing and foaming stream and at last flows to the sea with many windings through a broad low tract of meadow land If nor for this 20 miles of chasm we assume an average fall in the mile of 00 feet or 2000 feet in all which is a very large allowance greater indeed than the xate of deseent at the Little Falls of the Mohawk there yet remains of the elevation at 13aalbek 3729 English feet no less tharl 1729 fieet to be distributed alang the rest of the course or 35 geographical miles This gives an average falWl of very nearly 50 feet in a mile in a course mostly along allu vial valleys This result therefore goes strongly to confirm that found above in the case of the Orontes and both together would seem to aCord decisive proof that the reported elevation of the Bukaa must be greatly exaggerated Lct us hope that public attention may be called to the various points referred to in this paper and that they who have it in their power will speedily cause these questions to be put at rest for ever

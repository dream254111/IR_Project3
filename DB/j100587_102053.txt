gave an Account to this Society of the first Exercitation I published of the Medical Waters of Spaws of England what I have since added to the se cond Edition of that Exercitation I have already discour sed in a Paper to this Society As the Examination of all the Inland salt Springs or Brine Pits called Wiches also con cerning the specifical difference of Sea salt from the Salt of those Inland Brine Pits c I shall proceed to entertain you with a short Account of the 2d Exercitation now first published of the Me dicinal uses of the said Waters And because I could not well be understood when I had occasion to reason of Physical Matters unless I premised my own thoughts how true I leave it to others to judge and for that the main business of health and sickness seem ed to me to depend most upon the due concoction of meat in the Stomach and the good and bad condition of the humours of the Body resulting there from I have thought it sufficient to explain my self upon these matters There being in my Opinion little else required to account for all the Phaenomena of health and sickness and the right application of Medicines Concoction I have explained by Putrifaction for that I see no cause to think the change and resolution of meats and drinks to be differently made in the stomach of Ani mals from what they are in the open Air because the capacity of the Stomach and Guts are verily an other out side of them The Tabefaction of meat and drink is only therein hastned and sooner performed as for example Wine or Beer which do not sower of themselves of some time580 time in the open Air do yet turn to meer Vinegar in the Stomach in a trice and so it is to be understood of the speedy rotting of more solid meats therein I have confirmed this Doctrine with many other Argu ments which I refer too to the Treatise it self Now because meats that putrifie whether of the Herb kind or of Fish or Flesh do all therefore abound with vo latil and urinous Salt it is necessary that this Chyle in like manner should be salt And as it is the great business of Nature on the one hand by the Lacteae to clear the Chyle of the filth of the grosser Excrements so after its admission into the habit of the Body to purge it still of this necessary evil viz the urinous Salt by the Kidnies That the Chyle is attracted and sucked into the habit of the Body by the Lacteae which are the only true mouths of the Body That the Chyle first looses its Opacity and whiteness and becomes limpid in the blood Veins That the limpid Serum is the old Chyle which is not di stinct from the Lympha That the Lympha or Serum is ever a humour totally distinct from the red part of the blood which turns grumous when cold That from those two primary humours all the other se creted humours of the Body are made As from the red grumous Blood Choller alone From the new Chyle Urine From the same a little cleansed Milk from the Lympha Spittle from the most pure Lympha the genital humour That the cause of secret on is the Pulse its manner is explained by a magnetic Attraction which each secreted hu mour hath of its like also the suction of the secretory Ves sels581 sels is asserted which we think as reasonable to insist on for the Exit of the humours as to the Lacleae sor the Entrance of the Chyle into the Body both the Lacleae and all the secretory Vessels being from capillary beginnings not unlike inlarged in their progress these outwards and those in wards That the secretion of the Urine is made at the same time with the separation of the Lympha both participa ting of the same colour colour if the Serum of the Blood shall chance to be vitiated That the rest of the humours as the Pituita Milk the Genital Humour are never coloured tho vitiated because they undergo a third secretion at the least That the secretion of Choler is very slow and for that purpose the Blood is circulated through the Liver by veins only and this ought to be so because the red Blood from which only it is separated is not much herhaps scarce as  and likewise consists of very thick and heavy parts which therefore seem to require more time in the separation and altho the secretory Vessels in the Liver are very numerous yet where they joyn the common Ductus is narrow and very disproportionate On the other hand the Pituita is thin and hath many Exits and infinite Vessels to purge it as being separa ted from the great Mass of the Lympha or Serum in the Veins Thus much as to the humours in a natural and health ful State The humours are thus understood to be vi tiated That the Pituita springing out from innumerate foun tains in the Mouth Stomach and Guts also the Choler in the Duodenum from its there inserted Orifice because they are still carryed on farther in the Guts do often reenter the Body by the Lacteae weakened upon any Oc casion U When58 Whenever this readmission of Choler and Pituita hap pens by the  which it does in most Diseases we are then sick the Primary and radical Humours of the Body being contaminated with their own Excrements which had been once expelled So that the Antients are best understood in this sense when they tell us that Pituita causes cold Diseases and Choler hot ones that is the extraneous Pituita and Cho ler readmitted not that the habit of the Body did abound with them or breed them now in greater quantities but instead of a total ejection the evil guests iteal in a gain and Nature labours as it was in vain That the Chyle it self too is often in fault and is to be reckoned amongst the vitiating Humours viz where it is too plentiful from much feeding or made of Aliments that rot not kindly in the Stomach this also is to be eje cted as supervacaneous From these few things the symptoms of most Diseases are very easily to be accounted for As the various affe ctions of the Urine the Spittle Sweat c Why it is bilious and sometimes pale and thick c Why this is naturally sweet and thin sometimes acid and saltish and and sometimes thick like pus c and the like viz accor ding as this or that humour shall be mixt Crude and super fluous Chyle or extraneous Choler and Pituita readmitted or with the red blood it self Hence also true Indications may be taken for the cure of Diseases and the known vertues of simple Medicaments according as they have been delivered to us by the Antients more certainly applyed because these notions come nearest their do ctrine and consequently will more facilitate a practice de duced therefrom This Doctrine I have also illustrated with some few cases in Physic see the Treatise A Theory of Health and Diseases being briefly laid down as they relate to the humours we proceed to enumerate the583 the known effects of our Spaw Waters concerning the par ticulars see also the Treatise This also being dispatcht the natures and properties of each Ingredient is proposed to be examined And because nothing is new therein which the Antients have not well accounted for but the growing Salts of the Niter of Lime stone and abortive Vitriol we insist chiefly upon the exa mination of these two And affirm as the perpetual properties of them that they two alone of all the Minerals in Nature every where petrify as well as within our Bodies as without us and that it will be hard to find a third thing in na ture that does so That Petrification is best explained by Magnetism and that as Iron toucht with a solution of blew Vitriol imme diately attracts the Copper and firmly petrifies upon it so do the teeth of some men the only naturally naked bones of the body attract the abovesaid petrifying juices contained in meats and drinks But of this I purpose to discourse elsewhere more at large That these two Lapidiscent Juices of the Spaw Waters are the only efficient and in good part the material Causes too of the Stone in Man and other Animals crude humours being occasionally more or less implicated as they more or less abound in bodies and wrapped up in the coition of the Lapidescent Juices which thing Holly Wood does well illustrate it being observed above any sort of wood most inclined to petrification because of its abounding with a viscous Humour which is the Bird lime in use And because it may be objected that many are troubled with the stone and but few that drink of the Spaw waters I answer that in this sense all waters are Spaws but much more such as are so denominated as all the well waters of this City and England do testifie and therefore no man up on this account is free from the Stone and whoever shall U 2 attentively584 attentively examine the Urine of Mankind will find none free unless the strumous and gouty of which more I design elsewhere The Examination of Van Helmonts Doctrine about the Stone and the Arguments for this which I have laid down I omit and refer to the Treatise If Iron be in the calcined Calculus Humanus the Load stone if carefully applyed will extract it and demonstrate it to us as in truth it hath often done when I have applyed it for that purpose And if Limestone the Cal cination also is necessary because otherwise the Fat will hinder the Acids to work on it but a calcined bone will wholly be dissolved by any Acid Having dispatcht these things we come to the Medici nal uses of the Spaw Waters in England which we exa mine upon the Doctrines of other Writers of our English Spaws viz choosing out the particulars wherein they mostly agree As Hypochondriac Melancholy an ill habit of body from a ny chronical Disease as long Agues the Scurvy c The stone of the Kidnies and Bladder the Gout Worms Bar renness of Women c The excellency of the waters in the first case is dedu ced at large from the cause of that disease which we take to be too great a fullness of Chyle That they are less fit and not to be given to cachectic people without great Caution and Advise that they are not to be used in the Stone and Gout which two Diseases they can no ways help but by accident the reason of the Gout being from a stop and dejection or coition of some stony Particles upon the Membranes of the bones in the more narrow passages of the Joynts That Steel hath been of old noted as infamous for cau sing barrenness in women which ill Character of that Medicine I doubt is almost forgot in this Age and that therefore585 therefore abortive Vitriol the grand Ingredient of atramen tous Waters ought to be much more suspected in that case Altho the natural hot Waters outwardly used in  have been by the same antient Authors as much samed for the contrary good effect upon women The use of Oyntments before and after Bathing to be brought into use again and the debauch of staying long in the hot waters as it is now practised with us to be avoid ed c Non586 Nonvelle Maniere de Fortifier les places par Monsieur Blondel c a la Haye 1684 THe Author having considered the Art of Fortification as it is at present practised finds it not to have received pro portionable improvements to the Art of Attacquing This appears sufficiently in the success of the K of France who usually makes himself master of these Towns in 10 days which formerly were held capable of resisting as many Months There is therefore laid down a new way of Fortification which may take away from the Besiegers the advantages they draw from their number of Men and Cannon and give the Besieged room for the making use of more Cannonand supplying the want of men This is principally done by a vast inlargement of the Flancs and Demigorges so as to be capable of three very large Bat teries one over another and sometimes a Cavalier at top all which in some Figures may hold 100 or 120 Cannon sufficient to dismount any Battery that may be raised on the contrefears For the better explaining the Work there are 12 Tables ad ded The 1 is to shew the practise upon all sorts of Angles of Poligons given the 2 3 4 and 5 contain part of sever al sorts of Poligons fortified after this method The 6th is the Plane of a Tenaille made large and representing exactly all the parts of this Fortification The 7th is the same Plane with its profile The 8th is a Table for calculating the Angles in several Poligons fortified after this manner The 9th is a Table for calculating the lines in the same Poligons The 10th587 10th is to shew the easiness there is in reducing other Fortifi cation provided they have second Flancs to this manner without altering the Face of the Bastion the Motes or the Outworks The 11th is the Plane of the City of Dunkirk with the Antient Fortifications upon which are placed also the new ones of the Author that both Methods may be the better com pared together The 12th is a Plane of the City of Mastricht and its old Fortifications but reformd after this new manner

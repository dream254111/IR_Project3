points the North was the most frequent and the East the most rare The autumn was the wettest quarter and the spring the driest The rain of the three summer months was almost half as much again as that of the three winter months but the rain of the winter half year exceeded that of the summer halfyear by about onesixth of the rain of the whole year September gave the greatest quantity of rain and

time the frost lasted It changed to the SE on the 2d and on the 3d got into the SW where it remained almost all the rest of the month The following table shews the quantity of rain that fell with each wind in each month and in the whole year It appears that the SW gave more than twothirds of the rain of the whole year which seems not to have been altogether owing to the wet quality of that wind but in great measure to the greater length of time it blew than any other The numbers at the bottom of the table shew the proportional wetness of each wind upon the whole They are made from the numbers in the last horizontal row but one of this table compared with the numbers in the last horizontal row of TAB 1 For the wetness of each wind is in proportion as the quantity of rain it gave in the whole year directly and the number of days it blew inversely The former is shewn by the numbers in the last row but one of TAB VII and the latter by those in the last row of TAB 1 It appears that the South wind was the driest of all the SW the wettest and the W the next wettest T A B L E360 Dr HORSLEYS Abstract T A B L E VII Shewing the quantities of rain which fell severally with each wind in every

weather which having not been reversed within 24 hours fell on the days of octagonal aspect are distinguished by a line drawn underneath the number Vol LXVI B b b FromDr HORSLEYS Abstract of the Weather 363 From this table it appears that of 92 changes of weather in the whole year 46 fell on the days of the Moons pretended influence And rejecting of these changes all that were reversed within 24 hours of 53 that remain in all 27 fell on the days of lunar influence And if from these again we reject the octantal days con fining the Moons influence to the days of syzygie and quadrature there still remain 14 of the 53 for these days Of the new Moons four only were attended with a change of weather and of the full Moons three namely the new Moons of the months of March July Decem ber and February and the full Moons of October No vember January Both the settingin and the breaking of the great frost happened on days exempt from Lu nar influence Upon the whole the trial turns out more in favour of the Moon this year than it did the last But still the changes were many more on the days confessedly exempt from her influence than on those which have been sup posed to be the most subject to it The greatest monthly height of the barometer was only four times in this year accompanied with a NE wind namely in the months of April June November and February It was five times attended with a SW namely in March May August September and De cember and the greatest height observed in the whole year was one of these namely in the month of March V O L LXVI C c c Once364 Dr HORSLEYS Abstract

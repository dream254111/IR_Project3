and financed by a special committee separate from and independent of that of the hospital itself and many members of this committee have guaranteed large con tributions for a period of seven years Sir Ernest Cassel gives 1000 a year for this period besides having contributed over 800 towards the equipment of the laboratory Mr William Bonn gives 500 a year for two years and 250 a year for five years more Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton gives 250 a year for seven years Lord Iveagh and Major Henry Davis have each contributed 1000 to equipment expenses and many donations of smaller amounts have been received but there is still room for more if the objects of the de partment are to be completely secured The appeal from Mount Vernon is also for money which will be carried to a separate fund as a provision for the totally new class of expense which will be incurred but we have not yet been informed of the character of the re sponse which has been made to it The meth ods and principles concerned are practically the same in both cases and it is probable that the form of disease which attacks the lung will not be left without many sympa thizing contributors to an effort which seems to hold out renewed hope to a considerable proportion of those who suffer from it THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE RUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES PROFESSOR B MENSCHUTKIN Of St Peters burg writes to Nature in regard

Board GEORGE R NUTTER EditorinChief EVERETT V ABBOT WILSON G CROSBY GEORGE P FURBER Treasurer OTTO R HANSEN CHARLES M LUDDEN ALFRED E MCCORDIC EDWARD T SANFORD EDWARD I SMITH SAMUEL H SMITH JOSEPH WALKER WITH the present number the HARVARD LAW REVIEW begins its second volume During the coming year we purpose to continue the same general policy The leading articles will be contributed by the professors in the School and the others already indicated in the list of con tributors We hope besides to make a special feature of short articles written by younger members of the profession and by students in the School which shall deal if possible with subjects of current interest The summary of work in the Law School will be the same as before We wish to say a word about the  Recent Cases The field is too wide for Us to attempt a complete digest however brief of the multi tude of cases decided every month It is our aim to present only the cases comparatively few in number which show the progress and general tendencies of the law All such cases will be given and corm ments and references added wherever practicable in the hope that by making this department suggestive rather than exhaustive we may render it of more value In conclusion we realize that the REVIEW is yet only an experiment but prompted by the kind encouragement we have already received we shall do our best to keep the standard as high as possible We trust that in a few years with the continuance of this encourage ment it will have an established place and contribute its share in spreading the influence and work of the Harvard Law School THE recent Ohio Common Pleas case of State v 2atesl is not authority for the proposition that a dog may be the subject of larceny at common law as it has been currently reported The defendants were indicted for burglary in breaking and entering a stable with intent to steal two dogs and stealing two dogs of the value of 40 The defend ants demurred to the indictment The court overruled the demurrer on the ground that as the Ohio Larceny Act declares Ianything of value may be stolen a dog being a  thing of value may under the I Reported in The Albany Law Journal vol 37 P 233ANOTES 4 statute be stolen Breaking and entering with intent to steal a dog is therefore burglary in Ohio The case is interesting reading on account of the various authorities cited including poetical citations from Byron Pope and Burns and prose from Motley and the Bible MR SEYMOUR D THOMPSON contributes an interesting article to the Central Law Journal  on the use of documents to refresh the mem ory of witnesses1 The notion contained in this practice is that it is sufficient if the witness is  able to swear that the memorandum is cor rect although he may have forgotten the facts Therefore it is not material by whom the memorandumn is made or even that it is a copy Mr Thompson does not extend this principle so far as to regard the time when it was made as immaterial on the contrary he argues that because the memoranduim must have been made at or about the time of the events to which it relates therefore a witness should not be allowed to refer to his own previous testimony or depositions It seems formerly to have been thought that the witness could not use memoranda unless he had some independent recollections which merely needed a little revivifying but that idea has been broadened to the rule quoted above A witness may now refer to a memorandum of events of which he has no positive recollection provided he will swear that it is an accurate record In that case Mr Thompson thinks the document itself may be given to the jury though he admits a difficulty in finding any settled rule on the point The article contains many references to authorities IN the January  Law Quarterly Review  Mr Herbert Stephen dis cusses the recent New Zealand case of Reg v Hcad2 which is chiefly valuable in the specific limitation that it sets upon the doctrine of Reg v Geerizng and other later cases that where it is a question whether a given act was accidental or intentional evidence is admissible that such act was one of a series of circumstances in each of which the defendant was similarly concerned In Reg v Hall the defendant was indicted for the murder by poison ing of one Cain his wifes stepfather On the trial evidence was offered that the defendant had subsequently attempted to poison his wife in order to show that the administration of poison to Cain was not acci dental The court held that the evidence was not admissible because there was not sufficient prior evidence that the defendant was the person who administered the poison to Cain and because the evidence went less to show that the administration was intentional than it did to show that Hall was the person who administered it The court held says Mr Stephen that  evidence of this class could only be admitted on account of its relevancy to the questionof accident or intention when there was evidence aliunde fixing the prisoner with the administra tion In other words the court limits the doctrine of Reg v Geering to cases where the fact that the prisoner committed the act in

United States Supreme Court in the  telephone cases on March I9 involved a principle of patent law of far reach ing importance The court held not only that Bell was the first dis coverer and inventor of the telephone but that his patent covered the entire principle of transmitting sound by means of the vibratory or undu latory electric current and not merely the special apparatus by which he accomplished that result The reasoning of the court is as fol lows  Bell fotund out that by gradually changing the intensity of a continuous electric current so as to make it correspond exactly with the change in the density of the air caused by sonorous vibrations vocal and other sounds could be transmitted to a distance This was his discovery He then devised an apparatus for making these changes of intensity so that speech could be actually transmitted This was his invention The law patented not only the invention but the discovery The patent granted him is not limited to the mere appliance by which the discovery is made of actual value but extends to the process or principle itself His patent therefore extends to the entire art of traansmitting sound by means of the changing density of a continuous electric current The justices who dissented from the opinion on the ground that Drawbaugh was in fact the inventor of the telephone did not dissent from this general principle WE have received from Mr John F Baker of New York City an interesting communication upon the subject of the authorship of the Statute of Frauds from which we make the following extracts  Lord Mansfield in the important case of Wyndlzam v Clhetwynd i Burr 4IS assumed that the act was introduced into Parliament in the common way and not upon any reference to the judges and there expresses the belief that Lord Hale could not have drawn the statute as it was not passed by Parliament until after his death   The Statute of Frauds must have been prepared as early as I673 for at the first session of that year it was introduced in Parliament and after that it went before several committees and was discussed at several sessions previous to its passage in the spring of i677 Hence the theory advanced by Lord Mansfield would hardly seem tenable or sound nor is it certainly borne out by the facts of contemporaneous history  After a careful investigation of the question I think the conclusion will not escape the mind of the student that Sir Matthew Hale was the masterspirit in formulating the statute and that he prepared the bulk of that instrument that Sir Leoline Jenkins an able authority in pro bate law drew the sections as to wills that Lord Guilford took some part in preparing the statute and that Lord Nottingham not only drew the sections in relation to trusts and devises but was conspicuously active in piloting the bill through Parliament THE following classified list of the members of the Harvard Law School Association by States and Territories on April i

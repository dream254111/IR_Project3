recent writer can be more funda mental in economic science than the conception of wealth The student of economic literature finds a striking unanimity among writers since the publication of the We4alth of Nations that the real purpose of every treatise on this science is to investigate the nature and the laws of wealth It would appear to be a logical prerequi site therefore that every writer on economic science should have a definite conception of what is meant by wealth But is such the case What student has not learned to his sorrow that the most careful study of economic literature is unable to satisfy him exactly what wealth is  Adam Smith wrote An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations and yet made no at tempt to define wealth It may have appeared to him unnecessary to define scientifically that of which every one seemed to have a conception sufficiently clear But had he made the attempt at that stage of the development of society and of the sciences which pertain to it he would have found it difficult to formulate a scientific definition of wealth Nearly threequarters of a century of unprecedented economic social and political development had elapsed when John Stuart Mill published his Principles of Politi cal Economy and lent the weight of his great authority to the statement Every one has a notion sufficiently 1 John B Clark Philosophy of Wealth i886 p 2 615ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY correct for common purposes of what is meant by wealth Although this statement would seem to imply the futility of all attempts to define the popular notion even Mr Mill found it necessary to attempt such a definition Yet to the readers surprise he has hardly formulated a definition to which his authority would have given so much weight when directly and with the same authority he con demns it2 The student finds the evidence overwhelming that eco nomic writers from Adam Smith down have not had a notion of wealth sufficiently definite for scientific purposes The great diversity of fundamental principles is confusing to the reader and has contributed more than anything else to close the portals of this grand science not only to many a wouldbe student but more completely to the gen eral reading public There is a widespread conviction to day that economic science exists simply for the specialist and that even to him it is a matter of blind tradition with no consistent principle to guide it an arsenal of sophistry out of which arguments may be drawn to fortify any and every position For this mistaken notion the specialist is largely responsible The highest interests of society call for the wide diffusion of the principles of economic sci ence Whatever may be said of the attractiveness of practical questions the scientific spirit of the age demands that the fundamental conceptions of economic science shall be settled Besides as a recent writers has aptly said prac tical subjects cannot be adequately discussed so long as obscurity still hangs over fundamental conceptions the clear apprehension of which is absolutely essential to all correct reasoning Whether from a scientific or practical point of view therefore there can be no doubt that unanimity in the use 1 John Stuart Mill Principles of Political Economy Vol I p 18 D Appleton  Co I884 2 Vide this article p 6x8 3 John B Clark Philosophy of Wealth p I 6I6THE WEALTH CONCEPT of so important a term as wealth is not only desirable but imperative But would an attempt to secure such unanim ity be practicable and therefore timely  Confident that such an attempt made in the light of recent investigations is practicable the writer does not hesitate in the following pages to reopen the discussion of wealth By way of apology for the obscurity of their funda mental conceptions economists have been too fond of dwelling on the obstacles which their science encounters in the use of terms derived from the vocabulary of every day life Wealth is such a term They congratulate the natural scientist who can employ terms of his own inven tion and lament that their own science must make use of the vague terms of popular speech There is strong evidence that economists are beginning to realize that this socalled difficulty is largely apparent They have been compelled of late to recognize the necessityfor more careful analysis In their efforts to formulate a scientific definition of a popu lar term like wealthi economists should by no means ignore the universal popular notion of which Mr Mill writes That popular notion is the block of marble out of which the scientific conception must be chiselled Lying in the quarry of popular speech its outlines are vague and indefi nite Under the chisel of careful analysis however there emerges from the shapeless mass the clear outline of a scientific conception Only by careful analysis can the popular notion of wealth be made the guide to scientific truth What then is the universal popular notion of wealth of which Mr Mill writes  In popular speech wealth and money are employed as synonymous terms Men of large wealth are commonly spoken of as moneyed men If we would catechise business men to the query What do you understand by 1 Walker Political Economy 2d edition p 30 1887 Price Chapters on Practical Political Economy pp 8 g and Io Perry An Introduction to Political Economy 1887 p 20ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY wealth  the ordinary reply would be money To con tinue the catechism does this mean that business men commonly entertain the Mercantilist doctrine that wealth consists solely of money and that nothing is wealth which is not money that if a person owns one hundred dollars in money and a farm worth ten thousand dollars his wealth is one hundred dollars  Certainly not is the reply  in this case the persons wealth is ten thousand one hundred dollars Wealth is money and anything else which can be converted into money In common speech wealth is always expressed in terms of money We have carried our catechism far enough to show that there is a something with which money has to do which according to the popular notion constitutes the substance of wealth Now before we subject this popular notion to scientific analysis let us pause for a moment to note some of the current definitions of wealth Wealth says John Stuart Mill1  may be defined all useful and agreeable things which possess exchangeable value or in other words all useful and agreeable things except those which may be obtained in the quantity de sired without labor or sacrifice Furthermore Mr Mill writes 2 In common discourse wealth is always expressed in terms of money Thus far Mr Mills definition of wealth seems even in its indefiniteness to be in full accord with the popular notion A few pages later however with the statement3 It is essential to the idea of wealth to be susceptible of accumulation Mr Mill condemned the logic of his definition by drawing an arbitrary line to ex clude from the category of wealth things which cannot after being produced be kept for some time before being used as he thought that such things were never re garded as wealth4 The essence of this definition together 1 Principles of Political Economy Vol I p 26 2 Ibid Vol I p 20 s Ibid Vol I p 75 4 Ibid Vol I p 75 Clark Philosophy of Wealth pp 4 5 and 6 6I8THE WEALTH CONCEPT with the illogical restriction of the same Mr Mill may be justly said to have inherited from Adam Smith1 The influence of the Wealth of Nations upon Mr Mill is fur ther traceable in an illogical extension of his definition  The skill and energy and perseverance of the artisans of a country continues Mr Mill2 are reckoned part of its wealth no less than their tools and machinery Yet it is clearly evident that physical and mental characteristics and moral qualities do not possess exchangeable value As it is the peculiar province of political economy to investi gate the relations of man organized in society to his material environment there is no more mischievous error to be found in the whole range of economic literature than this one which confounds the physical and mental char acteristics and moral qualities of man with the material things to be derived from the outside world objects of mans effort and sources of the gratification of his needs Mr Mill was conscious that such an extension of his defi nition would do violence to popular usage and therefore in his Principles of Political Economy he uses the term in the restricted sense of material wealth as distinguished from nonmaterial or personal wealth If we examine the works of recent textwriters for their conceptions of wealth we shall find that some reject the term altogether as the word wealth has never been simply and exactly defined4 others like Professors Fawcett and Marshall follow Mr Mill literally accepting his definition illogically restricted and extended while others like President Francis A Walker without attempt ing an analysis of wealth seem to be in accord with Mr Mills definition minus its modifications Wealth says 1 Adam Smith Wealth of Nations Rogers edition Vol I pp 273283 2 Ibid Vol I p 75 Essays on some Unsettled Questions of Political Econ omy Essay III 3 Bastiat The Harmonies of Political Economy Stirlings translation Part I ch III Perry Elements of Political Economy pp 42 and 43 4 Perry An Introduction to Political Economy p 20 619ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY President Walker comprises all articles of value and nothing else As he makes no mention of Mr Mills illogical restriction of his definition it is fair to infer that President Walker does not regard susceptibility of ac cumulation as the open door to the category of wealth President Walker however expressly declines2 to classify physical and mental characteristics and moral qualities as wealth as such things are not transferable and conse quently do not possess value The analyses of Professor J B Clark have done much to prepare the way for a scientific use of the term wealth Pointing out with faultless logic how the orthodox writers have unduly limited their conception of wealth in one direc tion and unduly extended it in another Professor Clark has clearly revealed the full logical consequences of Mr Mills simple definition His analyses have done away with that sophistical classification of labor as productive and unproductive by which such persons as the actor the musical performer the public declaimer or reciter and the showman are excluded from the list of productive laborers He says   Whether avowed or not a definite conception is in reality under discussion in every treatise on this science For this conception the term wealth if used in the strictest accordance with history and etymology is an accurate designation The Saxon weal indicated a condition of relative wellbeing the state of having ones wants well supplied as compared with a prevailing stand ard No possession common to all men can constitute such relative wellbeing The limitless gifts of nature do not produce it since they are indiscriminating in their ministrations air and sunlight make no differences among men and though creating absolute wellbeing cannot create that social condition indicated by the term wealth This relative condition can be produced only by that which 1 Political Economy p 5 2 Ibid p 7 B Philosophy of Wealth pp 3 and 4 620THE WEALTH CONCEPT besides satisfying wants is capable of appropriation It is by a transfer of meaning that the term which primarily designated a condition of life has been applied to the things which produce the condition But not all causes of comparative happiness are included in the meaning of the word Wealth as historically used signified the wellbeing resulting from outward rather than from inward causes Health and contentment may make the shepherd happier than the owner of flocks yet the owner only is well off Reserving a broader term to designate wellbeing in gen eral usage has employed the word wealth to signify first the comparative welfare resulting from material possession and secondly and by a transfer the possessions them selves His analysis brought him to the following defi nition Wealth consists in the relativewealconstituting elements in mans material environment It is objective to the user material useful and appropriable Professor Clark has been eminently successful in that which he un dertook namely to elucidate the thought underlying the current definitions of wealth But the student turns from the comparative study of the definitions of President Walker and Professor Clark with the feeling that while the terms of the definitions differ the underlying thought is at least logically the same But what do these definitions define Do they define the universal popular notion of wealth  Even Professor Clark would make this the test of their scientific accuracy Who would claim he writes1  that the subtle intui tions that determine the ordinary use of terms are not a guide to scientific truth   On the surface it would appear that the economist had succeeded in defining the popular notion of wealth But let us subject that notion to analysis If we examine the expression of the popular notion of wealth which our catechism of business men has elicited shall we not find 1 Philosophy of Wealth p 72 62rANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY that the terms taken literally involve an inconsistency Shall we not find two distinct conceptions for which the term wealth is used  In the first place wealth is said to consist of money and of anything else which can be converted into money  Are not such things evidently articles of value and nothing else   Are they not relativewealconstituting elements in mans material environment objective to the user material useful and appropriable Thus far surely the economists definition accords well with the expression of the popular notion Again wealth in popular speech is said to be expressed in terms of money But concrete articles of value in mans material environment like areas of land buildings cattle bushels of wheat etc are no more ex pressible in dollars and cents than in feet and inches or in pounds and ounces If wealth is expressible in dollars and centsand it certainly is according to the popular notionconcrete articles of value cannot be wealth any more than they can be length or weight In this case concrete articles are the containers of wealth wealth is the content If according to the popular notion wealth is expressible in dollars and cents value must be the sub stance of wealth Concrete articles possess besides physical properties the economic quality of utility or usefulness for satisfying the needs of man and the measure of that quality we call value The dollar is our unit of value for measuring value as the foot is our unit of length for meas uring linear extension We can no more measure and express in dollars and cents anything else than value than we can measure and express in feet and inches anything else than linear extension Consciously or unconsciously we as surely apply the dollar to the value of the articles we posses or purchase as the salesman applies the yard to the cloth he sells Even economic writers in spite of all their efforts to formulate a scientific definition of the term wealth are guilty of the same inconsistency in its use In fact they more frequently use the term in some other sense than 622THE WEALTH CONCEPT that which is conveyed by their definition Does not President Walker fail to use the term wealth consistently with his definition  According to his definition concrete articles of value are wealth Later in his discussion of production he says that the production of wealth means the creation of values  that wealth is produced whenever value is added or acquired through any act or any pro cess Here the term wealth is used to designate the value of concrete articles which can be expressed in dol lars and cents To be consistent with his definition ought he not rather to have said that the production of wealth means the bringing forth of new articles of value that wealth is produced whenever through any act or any pro cess new articles are added to the already existing list of valuable articles His definition would evidently exclude from production all those acts and processes by which concrete articles already valuable receive an increment of value without undergoing any change in their essential character Does not Professor Clark in his Philosophy of Wealth use the term inconsistently with his definition  According to his definition wealth consists of concrete articles of value the relativewealconstituting elements in mans material environment like wheat and clothing and im plements But says Professor Clark2  If a farmer having surplus wheat sells it for an equivalent in clothing and implements his wealth changes its form of embodiment but not its amount The term wealth is evidently used here to signify an abstract quantum of value expressible in dollars and cents which through the transaction has changed its form of embodiment but not its amount To interpret the term wealth here by Professor Clarks definition of it would be to render the statement itself not true The farmers wheat would neither change its form of embodiment nor its amount but as a result of the trans 1 Political Economy pp 33 and 34 2 Philosophy of Wealth p 61 623ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY action the farmer would have in the place of the wheat entirely different articles Does not Roscher reveal the same inconsistency even in his definition The writer has before him the eleventh 1873 and seventeenth 1882 editions of Roschers Grundlagen der Nationalokonomie An interval of nine years had elapsed between the two editions of this great work In the former1 the author defines wealth as fol lows Wealth is the sum of all the economic goods com prised in the property of a physical or juridicial person In the latter edition2 he adds to this definition the follow ing restricting clause  After all debts have been deducted and all valuable claims have been added It is evident that debts and claims always represent definite quantities of value Is it not as impossible to deduct value from anything else than value as to deduct feet and inches from anything else than linear extension How can Roscher deduct quantities of value from concrete things which go to make up a persons property  But let us return to our analysis of the popular notion of wealth We have reached the point where it seems to us clear that the language of popular speech is inconsis tent and that this inconsistency has become absorbed into the works of economic writers Can we not explain this inconsistency  Shall we not find that what appears to be an inconsistency is only an instructive leaf of history  Is it not another illustration of the persistency of a term while the conception which it represents has been con stantly changing with the development of society Is not Professor Clark right that the term wealth if used in the strictest accordance with history and etymology is an accurate designation for that definite conception which is in reality under discussion in every treatise on economic science  But Professor Clark while his analysis is correct so far 1 System der Volkswirthschaft Vol I p I3 2 Ibid Vol I p 14 624THE WEALTH CONCEPT as it goes has failed to bring the history of the term wealth down to date He has dropped the narrative before reaching the period in which social differentiation had been carried so far through the principle of division of labor as to reveal the interdependence of men in economic relations and the organic nature of society Does not his own logic compel him to go a step farther  In that earlier period of the development of economic society when each business establishment was an eco nomic unit independent of every other organized to pro duce simply those things which were to be used in the business or consumed by the personnel of the establishment the term wealth signified simply material possessions So cial differentiation had barely commenced and the organic structure of society in industrial relations was not appar ent Men thought simply of the relation of concrete articles to their own individual use The rearing of flocks the tilling of the soil the practising of the hand trades had for their aim to provide such articles There were to be sure different conditions of relative wellbeing then as now but concrete articles constituted the only basis for comparing one mans condition with that of another They were the only  relativewealconstituting elements The man who owned land and buildings or flocks was better off in the estimation of other men than the man who owned nothing the man who owned a larger flock was more well to do than he who owned a smaller A bountiful harvest contributed to the relative welloeing of the husbandman Mans wants were few In general men labored to obtain each for himself the same varieties of articles These were few in number to correspond to mans wants A persons wealth therefore could be ascer tained only by taking an inventory of the concrete articles he owned The amount of a persons wealth could be stated only in terms of area weight or number How different the situation in that later period of the development of economic society whose chief character 41 625ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY istic is universal interdependence of parts production and consumption for others Today it is clearly evident that the structure of industrial society is organic Political science and statesmanship all of the sciences and arts which pertain to society recognize the great fact that society is an organic unit Is not the economist who has too often taken things by bits and scraps compelled to recognize the same great fact and from that vantage ground to look at the whole of the complicated interests of industrial society in one connected view  Has not the popular notion of wealth adjusted itself to the organic nature of industrial society Can the economist define wealth without the comprehensive view which the concep tion of society as an organism affords  The individual is no longer industrially independent he no longer exists and labors simply for himself and those dependent upon him Social differentiation has made him part of a living structure an organism So close is his dependence upon others of his race that his conduct is dictated and his nature transformed by it In existing and laboring for himself he exists and labors for the social organism He goes into business not to produce specific articles for his own use as formerly but a quantum of value The specific articles produced are turned into the general market and to the general market each man must go to obtain the articles required to satisfy his own needs The individual estimates the product of his busi ness not so much in pounds feet or dozens as in dollars and cents The participants in production share no longer the concrete articles manufactured but a quantum of value The laborer receives as his share not the yard of cloth he weaves but the value he creates A persons power to command from the general market the necessaries com forts and luxuries of life is in direct ratio to the quantum of value he controls The condition of relative well 1 Clark Philosophy of Wealth pp 37 38 39 40 and 41 626THE WEALTH CONCEPT being of the members of the social organism therefore is produced not by the ownership of concrete articles but by the ownership of a quantum of value The thousand cases of shoes do not determine the owners position on the scale of relative wellbeing they can ward off neither hunger nor cold The value which they possess is the  relativewealconstituting element The knowledge that one man owns a factory and another man a farm does not enable us to compare their economic conditions A man may own a given thousand bushels of wheat today and a month hence but there is no surety that his condi tion of  relative wellbeing will remain unchanged A rise or decline in the value of wheat raises or lowers his position in the scale of  relative wellbeing A man may be a rich man today and a poor man tomorrow and yet be owner of the same concrete articles It cannot be de nied that social differentiation has changed the conception of wealth A persons wealth cannot be ascertained now as formerly by taking an inventory of the concrete arti cles he owns Wealth no longer signifies material pos sessions Value is the substance of wealth To prove this let us continue our catechism of business men Enumerate to a business man the concrete articles owned by a certain person with whom he is not acquainted assure him if you will that he owns free from debt one hundred acres of land ten houses five horses etc and then ask him if he knows what the persons wealth is Would he not reply in substance as follows  Certainly not you have enumerated to me the concrete forms in which the persons wealth is embodied but I cannot know his wealth until I know the value of all those things The land and houses may be located in the heart of a flourish ing city or in some declining hill town the horses may con tain a Maud S or they may be all wornout hack horses Tell me in dollars and cents what all those things would bring in the market and I know the persons wealth It 627ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY is a matter of comparative indifference in what particular form the wealth may be embodied But value1 is a generic term and there are two species with which the student is familiar It is imperative there fore that the writer should explain more definitely in what sense he uses the term value when he says that value con stitutes the substance of wealth The individual though a member of the social organ ism still retains his individual character He is depend ent primarily upon his own exertions for the satisfaction of his needs although the specific articles he makes flow into the general market and from the general market he obtains the articles he wishes to use Social differentiation has brought it about that every individual must bargain with the social organism for the things he wishes to use To every legitimate transaction in the market therefore the individual is one party society is the other The social organism is a unit and we speak in a collective sense of its needs as we do of the needs of the individual member of that organism There are two standpoints therefore which the economist must recognize in studying the relation of man to his material environment the standpoint of society and the standpoint of the indi vidual From the former he acquires the conception of value to society value in exchange market value  and from the latter the conception of value to the indi vidual  value in use  To find the  exchange value  of concrete articles one must measure their effective 2 utility to the social organism while to find the  value in use  of concrete articles the individual must measure their effective  utility to himself Only in the light of these two species of value can any legitimate transaction in the market be explained The salesman acts as the agent of 1 For full particulars of value vide Karl Knies Tiibinger Zeitschrift 1855 Karl Knies Das Geld II Auflage 1885 pp 167 and I68 J B Clark Philoso phy of Wealth ch V 2 J B Clark Philosophy of Wealth pp 77 and 78 628THE WEALTH CONCEPT the social organism and having measured the exchange value of his loaf offers it to the millionaire and the day laborer at the same price No one can deny that the value in use of the loaf to the day laborer is much greater than to the millionaire But the social organism is no respecter of persons If the wouldbe consumer buys he must buy at the terms which society imposes whether he buys or not rests entirely with himself No prudent man buys unless in his judgment the value in use of the article is greater than or at least equal to its  exchange value  Value in use therefore determines where in the social organism the concrete articles in the market shall be used while value in exchange fixes the conditions under which they may be obtained How else can we explain the fact that we pass by in the market so many articles truly desirable others we give only a wist ful glance others we ponder long and decide slowly to purchase or not to purchase while for others the bargain is quickly made Value in use is individual and no man can estimate for any one but himself Value in use therefore can furnish no standard for comparing one mans condition of relative wellbeing with that of another it cannot be the substance of wealth The old homestead which has been the family pride for genera tions does not contribute to the wealth of the owner to the extent of one hundred thousand dollars although the owner may estimate its value to him at that figure That par ticular homestead can be to no one else what it is to him In economic relations the social organism is rarely influ enced by sentiment In the market the old homestead is worth twentyfive hundred dollars and must be rated at that figure if one would compare the owners economic condition with that of his neighbors A projected high way takes from the old homestead a strip of land No one but the owner thinks the loss irreparable For in spite of the loss of the half acre the value of the homestead to society is greater than before and the owner is better 629ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY off in the estimate of his neighbors Although a large sum would be no temptation to a man to part with the lock of hair he so carefully guards his only possession besides the clothes he wears the lock of hair contributes nothing to his wealth To society the lock of hair possesses no value It is only from the standpoint of society that it becomes possible to compare one mans economic condi tion with that of other men A mans economic condition can only be determined by estimating the quantum of exchange value that belongs to him Exchange value therefore is the only relativewealconstituting element it is the substance of wealth both according to the popular notion and using the term in the strictest accordance with history and etymology Wealth according to this definition is equally accepta ble to all men But this individual has a decided preference in regard to the form of embodiment of his wealth His purpose in entering the market is to change the form of its embodiment but not to change its amount If the ex change is a fair one his wealth is left without increase or diminution But as a means to an end there has arisen one universally acceptable form of embodiment for wealth namely metallic money For that reason if for no other he who prefers to have a part of his wealth in some new concrete articles readily accepts money as the most con venient means to that end The traveller takes the wealth for his journey in the form of money For the consumer money is the key which most easily unlocks the market At some time the business man prefers his capital in the form of money that he may more readily choose the instru ments with which to work It is indeed not strange that wealth and money in popular speech are synonymous terms We have traced the evolution of the wealth concept We have attempted to show that the conception of wealth which the current definitions define belongs to an earlier period of economic development that the proces of social 630THE WEALTH CONCEPT differentiation which has rendered the structure of indus trial society organic has wrought a change in the concep tion of wealth that the term wealth today signifies no longer concrete articles but a quantum of exchange value An important corollary follows from our analysis It is evident that the whole question of production is relative to the period of economic development When wealth sig nified concrete articles of value production was the bring ing forth of new articles of value All labor was directed toward that end No labor was productive which did not add to the existing list of valuable articles There was little division of labor no commercial class no legis lator judge or officer of justice But when social differ entiation had given rise to a commercial class to the army and navy to the legislator judge and the officer of justice there came into existence a class of men who according to the current conception of wealth must be regarded as unproductive Their activities however useful and impor tant they might be resulted in no new concrete articles With their conception of wealth the classic philosophers and Church Fathers who were unable to find a legitimate basis for commercial activities were more logical than modern economists On the basis of the conception that wealth is concrete it is impossible to prove to the satisfaction of the logical mind that all labor in modern society creates wealth But this is exactly what econo mists have attempted to do and there are no chapters in economic science more unsatisfactory than those which treat of the relation of labor to wealth For the produc tion of wealth in all periods of economic development nature has always furnished the substance and man the modes Social differentiation has not only changed the conception of wealth but it has multiplied the modes of producing wealth With the organic conception of wealth as a quantum of exchange value it becomes evident that any acts or any processes which result in an increase of the existing quantum of exchange value are productive 63IANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of wealth Every man can select that mode for creating wealth for which he is best adapted by nature The mode he selects may be one which results in a concrete article of no use to himself He can trust the social organism to place at his disposal the specific articles he wishes to use of better quality and cheaper than he could have made them himself No demonstration is needed to prove that the commercial class the army and navy the legislator judge and officer of justice increase directly the quantum of  exchange value and are therefore productive Is it not time to star as obsolete that conception of wealth which our textbooks define and put in its place the organic con ception of wealth  It is not necessary to show that the problem of distribu tion in modern society is based on the organic conception of wealth It is evident to every one that it is the new quantum of exchange value created that is shared by the participants in production But another important corollary follows from our analy sis The evolution of the wealth concept has wrought a change in the relation of wealth to property Property is a legal term and signifies the right of a person to control over a concrete thing to the exclusion of all other persons It is not an absolute right but is defined by law and has been modified from time to time to meet the requirements of progressive society By transfer the term property is used to denote the things over which a person has the right of exclusive control Using the term in this sense we see that a persons property can be found by taking an inventory of the concrete articles over which he exer cises this right At that period of industrial development when the term wealth signified concrete articles the very same concrete articles were both wealth and property to their owner They were wealth so far as they had a bearing on 1 Knies Politische Oekonomie II Auflage 1883 pp 208211 Knies Das Geld II Auflage I385 pp I24I40 632THE WEALTH CONCEPT the owners economic condition they were property so far as reference was had to the owners right of control over them Now that wealth has come to signify a quantum of exchange value without reference to its form of em bodiment we see that the relation of wealth to property has changed A persons wealth is now the quantum of exchange value which belongs to him A persons property comprises the concrete articles over which he has the right of exclusive control The relation of wealth to property is not so close that a persons property must necessarily comprise the concrete articles which contain his wealth Now that the custom of borrowing and loan ing wealth has become prevalent the concrete articles in which a persons wealth is contained may be the property of some other person To determine a persons wealth therefore one must first ascertain the quantum of ex change value his property contains and then deduct all debts and add all valuable claims We thus see that a per son may hold the right of property in land buildings and implements and yet possess little or no wealth for while the concrete articles may belong to the property of one person the quantum of exchange value they contain may belong to the wealth of another To every man wealth is the sacred thing because it is the fruit of his labor While he has a preference in regard to the particular concrete form in which he shall invest his wealth yet that is a matter of far less importance to him From the multiplicity of concrete articles in the market he is sure to find something suited to his need He chooses to have his wealth now in one form later in another He enters the market not to change his wealth but to change his property Instead of so many bushels of wheat he wishes implements and clothing If the interests of so ciety call for the surrender of a particular concrete article for the public good the individual submits and recognizes the justice of the demand in case his wealth is left intact 633634 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The concrete article is not the product of his labor the value that it contains is Let society guarantee to the individual his wealth and the individual will be found ready to yield to public expediency in regard to the concrete articles which he may hold as his property CHARLES A TUTTLE Amherst College

j100588,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London,108317,Supplement to a Paper On the Nervous Ganglia of the Uterus,i207001, 211  XV Supplement to a Paper  On the Nervous Ganglia of the Uterus By ROBERT LEE MD FRS Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians London Received June 14Read June 19 1845 IN the First Part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1841 I have described and represented in two engravings the nervous ganglia situated on the sides of the neck of the uterus in which the great sympathetic and third sacral nerves unite and from which branches proceed to the vagina bladder rectum and the whole of the lower part of the uterus In an Appendix to that paper published in the Second Part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1842 there is contained a further account of the nervous structulres situated on the fundus and body of the uterus and an engraving in which the appearances they present at the full period of gestation have been ac curately delineated From the form colour vascularity and general distribution of these structures and from their branches actually coalescing and being continuous with those of the great sympathetic and spinal nerves I inferred that they were true nervous ganglionic plexuses and formed the nervous system of tthe uterus enlarged during pregnancy In a gravid uterus at the full period I have recently and with still mnore care traced the great sympathetic and spinal nerves into the two hypogastric ganglia and fiom thence over both sides of the uterus to the fundus A lens which magnified six diameters was employed in this dissection which enabled me with unerring certainty to distinguish and to separate the nervous filaments fromn the fine cellular membrane by which they are so closely surrounded and from all the other contiguous structures In this mlinute dissection many of the details of the nervous system of the uterus are more perfectly shown than in any previous dissection mlade by me and they confirm in the most complete manner the accuracy of all that is contained in my previous communications on this subject to the Royal Society To this preparation I can now appeal as affording a perfect demonstration of the truth of all my statements respect ing the ganglia and other nervous structures of the uterus

length specimens of this fern were received which were said to have grown wild at Cascade in the edge of the Black Hills A personal investigation was the only thing which could settle the matter for it still seemed very likely that some mistake had been made and that the specimens received had come from some more southern station Accordingly I visited the locality August 24 1898 in company with Dr F E Clem ents and we were astonished to find this fern in great abundance along the banks of Cascade Creek This stream is a couple of metres wide and twenty to thirty centi metres deep and is fed by several large springs of warm water having a temperature of about 26 Cent We very carefully ex amined the locality and satisfied ourselves that this fern is indigenous and that it has not been introduced by human agency Since this discovery I have seen specimens of the same species collected at Cascade in 1892 and a fragment collected in 1890 at Hot Springs ten miles distant along the banks of Fall Creek another warm stream Mrs Alice M Crary a keen observer who has lived many years in the Black Hills assures me that they grew abundantly along Fall Creek at Hot Springs before that place was settled All this tends to cor roborate our conclusion that these ferns were not transplanted by human agency and that we have here a curious problem in the distribution of a species THE FUNCTION OF BLOOM As is well known to botanists but not so well known to the general public the white powdery coating on some leaves and fruits is waxy in nature and is called bloom  in technical works on Botany Its function has received some attentionr Mr Darwin having made it the object of some studies in his later years In a recent number of the Laboratory Bulletin of Oberlin College along with papers by the lamented Professor H L Jones is a short one by his assistant Miss Roberta Reynolds giving the results of a series of experirments which show that when the bloom is removed from the epi dermis the transpiration of water is greatly increased Thus in case of Agave utahensis the loss was about two and ahalf times as much from the leaf which was without bloom as from that with the bloom With Echeveria peacockii it was two and athird times as much with Agave verschaffelti one and fourtenths Agave americana about two and ahalf an undetermined Agave two times as much two unnamed species of Cotyledon about one and onethird It was observed also that on damp days the dif ference between the leaves was less than on dry days so too there was less difference in the case of young leaves than when old ones were used A TINY PINE TREE LAST summer I climbed Green Mountain near Boulder Colorado and found growing from a crevice in one of the rocks at the summit a small tree of Pinus albicaulis Engelm about thirteen centimeters high and five millimeters in diameter It was unbranched and bore a single terminal tuft of leaves And yet this tiny tree when carefully examined was found to have twentyfive distinct annual rings I know of no other case of natural dwarfing carried to such an extreme and therefore place this one on record CHARLES E BESSEY THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA CURRENT NOTES ON ANTHROPOLOGY BOTANICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCIENT AZTECS STUDENTS of ancient Mexico are acquainted with the work of Dr Hernandez who was sent by Philip II to study the plants and 588 SCIENCESCIENCE minerals of New Spain His  Natural His tory  was printed in 1651 and is a store house of the knowledge of the Aztecs on that subject In describing a plant he al ways gave its native name and how em ployed by the Indians In the Anales del Instituto Medico Nacional Tom II No VI 1898 is an article by Dr F Altamirano in which he endeav ors to identify the plants mentioned by Hernandez and give their modern botanical names He quotes fiftyone assigning most of them to genera and species and adds the modern uses to which they are applied The article forms a useful appendix to Hernandez SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN MAN IN a pamphlet of about forty pages Prof Dr Giuseppe Marina sums up the results of his measurements of 22755 adults Italians Slavs and Germans His studies tend to diminish the value of the skull form as a criterion and to cast doubt on the  criminal type But the most novel of his results relate to the relation of the sexual characteristics in general to the pelvic diameters He formulates the law that in proportion as the pelvic index in the one sex approaches that of the other this similarity will be correlated to a cranial form and capacity and to a number of traits physical and mental which belong to the other sex Feminilism in the male for example is displayed by the length of the iliac crests the shortness of the inferior extremities a wider pubic angle ampler cotyloid cavities greater distance of the umbilicus from the pubis development of the mammae etc Dr Marina points out that these traits are racial sexual di morphism being much more marked in some than in other stocks The point is of widereaching significance Studii An tropologiei sugli Adulti Torino 1897 Fra telli Bocca 589 HEREDITY A CONTRAST IN the Revue Scientifique for April last Dr Cesare Lombroso in an able discussion of the relative influence of heredity and en vironment announced the conclusion that  the influence of environment is potent enough to annihilate all ethnic tiaits At the meeting of the German Anthro pological Society in August of this year Professor Kollmann of Basel in an address on the same subject stated the dictum of science to be that the influence of heredity is far stronger than that of environment The ethnic traits are immortal and persist though the peoples who bear them may dis appear from history Globus Aug 27 1898 These are two of the most eminent au thorities among European anthropologists As the traditional circus man said  You pays your money and you takes your choice D G BRINTON UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SCIENTIFIC

American Supreme Courts and even over the much shorter one of those who achieved eminence or possessed originality and these two are not always the same Justice Holmes seems to me the only one who has framed for himself a system of legal ideas and general truths of life and composed his opinions in harmony with the system already framed His opinions present themselves as instances naturally serving to exhibit this general body of principles in applica tion The framework is his own and not some orthodox commenta tors Shaw Bronson Tilghman Lumpkin senior Gaston Ryan Field of Massachusetts Doe Gibson Walworth Blackford Nelson Mitchell Beasley Napton Selden Daly Appleton Gold thwaite  none of these not to mention living ones give the im pression of having worked out themselves and for their own use an harmonious construction of general principles I suppose that Kent came the nearest to doing it Another trait of his opinions and one that adds to their fascina tion is the epigram instinct which will not be suppressed Wise maxims sententious summaries and pithy brocards strew the pages Only Lord Bowen can be compared with him in this A horsecar cannot be handled like a rapier I Nowadays we do not require pleadings to be guarded against all the possible distortions of perverse ingenuity 2  A man cannot shift his mis fortunes to his neighbors shoulders  A man cannot justify a libel by

humbug 9 The law constantly is tending towards con sistency of theory 10  A trespasser is not caput lupinum 11 There is no general policy in favor of allowing a man to do harm to his neighbor for the sole pleasure of doing harm 12 No doubt as a stylist he is unique and unapproached There have been others Doe Mansfield Jessel Camden to name a few  but none in his genre except Bowen Another commanding thing is the philosophy of life at large which decorates and dignifies his technical lore of the law Truth in general is invoked for the decision of legal truth The moment you leave the path of merely logical deduction you lose the illusion of certainty which makes legal reasoning seem like mathematics But the certainty is only an illusion nevertheless 13  One of the eternal conflicts out of which life is made up is that between the effort of every man to get the most he can for his services and that of society disguised under the name of capital to get his serv ices for

that you cannot produce something out of nothing and make them promptly detect the pretense of doing so with which at present the talk of every day is filled I should think it had more than paid for

not very much matter what that fact is for every fact leads to every other by the path of the air 20The main part of intellectual education is not the ac quisition of facts but learning how to make facts live 21 The man of action has the present but the thinker controls the fu ture 22 The labor of lawyers is an endless organic process the organism whose being is recorded and protected by the law is the undying body of society 2  I do not believe that the justifica tion of science and philosophy is to be found in improved machin ery and good conduct Science and philosophy are themselves neces saries of life By producing them civilization sufficiently accounts for itself 24 Our ideal is repose perhaps because our destiny is effort just as the eyes see green after gazing at the sun 25 Although one believes in what commonly with some equivoca tion is called necessity  that phenomena are always found to stand in quantitatively fixed relations to earlier phenomena  it does not follow that without such absolute ideals we have nothing to do but sit still and let Time run over us The mode in which the inevitable comes to pass is through effort Consciously or un consciously we all strive to make the kind of a world that we like 26 The tendencies of humanity are seen to flow through and about and behind the myriad instances of the laws precedents His philosophy of life appears in his judgments And yet the Bar does not after all see the whole of it nor the greatest part of it in those opinions To find it one must consult the little volume privately printed of Speeches This is not the place to descant upon its varied treasures But two of its most recurrent principles are these Life as a fact is a stern endless 19 Memorial Day Address i884 2 Lecture on the Profession of

career is an effort to reach an unattainable ideal the ideal not the actual must be the aim we must strive yet it is never attainable We accept our destiny to work to fight to die for ideal aims At the grave of a hero who has done these things we end not with sorrow at the inevitable loss but with the contagion of his courage and with a kind of desperate joy we go back to the fight The rule of joy and the law of duty seem to me all one  From the point of view of the world the end of life is life Life is action the use of ones powers As to use them to their height is our joy and duty so it is the one end that justifies itself Life is a roar of bargain and battle but in the very heart of it there rises a mystic spiritual tone that gives meaning to the whole and trans mutes the dull details into romance Man is born to act To act is to persist in affirming the worth of an end And to persist in affirming the worth of an end is to make an ideal 27  A teacher of law should send men forth with a pennon as well as with a sword to keep before their eyes in the long battle the little flutter that means ideals honor yes even romance in all the dull details 28 Still another notable trait of his opinions of course is the in stinct for the history of the law He cannot employ and apply a principle without thinking of it as having a history How few judges really possess the historical sense  the sense that every thing now in the world has had a becoming in old Heraclitus phrase and that therefore its past is always worth examining to explain its present And in Justice Holmes case his constant re sort to the landmark sources of our legal history has had a special flavor in our judicial annals because of its rarity It is a constant ensample and may we say reproach  to the scores of indus trious and accurate contemporaries who never reveal the slightest interest in the laws history or if an interest then no respectable acquaintance with the proper sources I have done my share of quotation from the Year Books he admitted at the Langdell Dinner in i895 27 Speech at the 5oth Anniversary of Graduation I9I1 28 Speech at Northwestern University I902JUSTICE HOLMES AND THE LAW OF TORTS 6o5 But it is not only by the  Y B  citations that you will identify his opinions from those of other judges The correct sources what ever their range you may expect to find that he has consulted and pillaged aptly for his need On a chance page for example deal ing with repayment of a dishonored draft29 appear quotations from the Selden Societys Publications Brunners Forschungen and Heuslers Deutsches Privatrecht to testify to a point in the history of commercial paper And the general postulate which precedes Our law of negotiable paper like the rest of our law has had a strictly European origin and history which are tolerably well known was it slyly given that suggestive whipsnap at the end For among the judges who else knows it Who else indeed cares One must mourn and a public lament has elsewhere been uttered the obstinate indifference of our judges to the history of their own law Justice Holmes opinions shine with an historical light which in its luster of distinction ought to be even as the Penang Diamond30 a lure to the avid ambition of the judicial world And who shall say that his concise and crystallized style of his torical allusion may not have been deliberately chosen as the most pointed way of preaching the propriety of history while avoid ing the prosy prolixity of exegetic elaboration May we not sup pose him to be convinced that when some reference to history is necessary in a judicial opinion a light indication of what everyone knows or ought to know who has studied such things is better than something more solemn and longwinded I believe that would be his point of view The best thing about Justice Holmes taste and learning in his tory is that it has not dulled his sense for the practical needs in the 29 Aslanian v Dostumian I74 Mass 328 54 N E 845 i899 30 Have you ever read Lincoln Colcords romance The Drifting Diamond If not it is worth while 31 There is a good example in Grant Timber  Mfg Co v Gray 236 U S I33 i9i5 where the question was whether the Fourteenth Amendment was encoun tered fatally by a Louisiana statute forbidding a petitory action for property to be brought by a defendant in a possessory action until after judgment in the latter The opinion continues From the exceptio spolii of the PseudoIsidore the Canon Law and Bracton to the assize of novel disseisin the principle was of very wide applica tion that a wrongful disturbance of possession must be righted before a claim of title would be listened to  And from Kant to Ihering there has been much philoso phizing as to the grounds p I34 And thus it sketches ten centuries in a sen tence6o6 HARVARD LAW REVIEW law of today He is neither enchained by his respect for the past as Blackstone was nor deluded by a philosophy of historic contin uity as Savigny was That too strong an emphasis on our contin uity with the past will lead us astray he has often warned us  The present has a right to govern itself so far as it can And it ought always to be remembered that historical continuity with the past is not a duty it is only a necessity 12 Questions of here and now occupy nine hundred and ninetynine thousandths of the ability of the world 3  To rest upon a formula is a slumber that prolonged means death 4  The law has got to be stated over again and I venture to say that in fifty years we shall have it in a form of which no man could have dreamed fifty years ago 73 No other ever better exemplified the proper use of history as John Morley defined it I want to know what men did in the thirteenth century not out of antiquarian curiosity but because the thirteenth century is at the root of what men think and do in the nineteenth It is the Present that we seek to understand and to explain And yet his contentedness with the prospect of progress never rose to a too fervid faith in the virtues of reform His most recent public utterance Ideals and Doubts 36 is devoted to this themfie and its closing sentence in sounding the note of the Doubter vouchsafes us also one of his neatest epigrams It is a pleasure to see more faith and enthusiasm in the young men and I thought that one of them made a good answer to some of my skeptical talk when he said You would base legislation upon regrets rather than upon hopes But Justice Holmes familiarity with legal history is only a phase of his broader interest in all literatures of life I wonder whether any other man now pronouncing upon the complexities of humanity in law possesses so rich an acquaintance with all the recorded aspects of humanity A mans private library large or small is not always a fair index of his range of knowledge but in this instance it is Putting my hand casually on one of his book 32 Speech at the Langdell Dinner i895 3a Eulogy on

touched a row of Gabriel Tardes works on psychology longer than any I have ever seen outside of a bibliographical list And I have sometimes wondered how many judges or lawyers were sufficiently down to date in the fine arts to identify the Degas who was casually mentioned to illustrate a point in a brilliant opinion on the copyright of a circus poster37 When he was recommending a friend some three or four years ago to enter into the fascination of Fabres studies of bee life the philis tine friend did not then appreciate that he himself would later be seeking the hitherto unopened Fabre in the strictly technical quest of materials on the evolution of legal order in insect life No mans methods of his own perhaps can be advised unconditionally for others to imitate but Justice Holmes generality of absorption is certainly something that the young lawyers of today can afford to take notice of For it is a time when the growing lawyer must realize that law too is growing and that our profession must be amply prepared to understand the cosmic range of facts which go to shape it The short and the long of it is that these opinions are literature not merely law classics not merely technics But why do I linger and digress at the threshold of my subject  the Law of Torts Perhaps because I cannot say what I want to say without revealing an undue egoistic bias For the truth is that I admire supremely Justice Holmes Law of Torts because he is the only writer who has publicly agreed with me as to the fundamentals of that subject It cannot be proved from the records and indeed the records would suggest the con trary but it is a fact that before his pioneer article Privilege Malice and Intent appeared in the i894 May number of this REVIEW38 I had hit upon the same general analysis which was set forth The Tripartite Division of Torts in the i894 November number39 Until his article appeared I had not ventured to pro mulgate so radical a discovery but his printed corroboration gave me courage What was before but subjective truth now became objective truth Confirmed by him I have never since doubted And I am also convinced that the scientific discussion and harmon 37 Bleistein v Donaldson Lith Co i88 U S 239 I903 Or Goya or Manet for that matter These figure in the opinion likewise Ruskins Elements of Drawing 38 8 HARV L REV I 39 Ibid p 2006o8 HARVARD LAW REVIEW ization of our torts system will never be possible until that basic scheme is carried out into all details by some qualified person What then was Justice Holmes system It expressed the doc trines of torts in three postulates I Actions of tort are brought for temporal damage The law recognizes temporal damage as an evil which its object is to prevent or to redress IL When it is shown that the defendants act has had tem poral damage to the plaintiff for its consequence the next question is whether that consequence was one which the defendant might have foreseen    If the manifest probability of harm is very great and the harm follows we say that it is done maliciously or intentionally if not so great but considerable we say that the harm is done negligently if there is no apparent danger we call it mischance III But    in some cases a man may even intend to do the harm and yet not have to answer for it i e   the common place    that the damage is actionable if done without just cause   There are various justifications In these instances the justification is that the defendant is privileged knowingly to inflict the damage complained of But whether and how far a privilege shall be allowed is a question of policy Not only the existence but the extent or degree of the privilege will vary with the case  In all such cases the ground of decision is policy and the advantages to the community on the one side and the other are the only matters really entitled to be weighed 40 Such is Justice Holmes tripartite division of tort principles Throughout nearly a hundred and fifty opinions his system can be seen in consistent application aided by some of the other gen eral philosophical and social truths already alluded to Naturally not all nor most of these opinions have any concern with the gen eral theory But at any rate one could nearly write a treatise on torts out of this body of opinions And it will perhaps serve as a tribute though sadly inadequate to this achievement of his if we now survey briefly the array of decisions noting here and there some of the more remarkable4 40 8 HARV L REV Pp 19 41 The writer has taken the liberty to arrange the cases in his own order of details which is not inherent in Justice Holmes theoryJUSTICE HOLMES AND THE LAW OF TORTS 609 I THE ELEMENT OF TEMPORAL DAMAGE TO THE PLAINTIFF Under Corporal Damage a principal question of course concerns the doctrine of the first Spade case42 involving illness caused through fright Here he sagely emphasizes the limitation defined in that case as purely an arbitrary exception based upon a notion of what is practicable 4 Under the Death Statute his principal opinion dealt with the problem of an infant injured en ventre sa mere and dying after birth4 Under Societary Damage in Defamation the high lights are represented in the doctrine that to say of a nurse that she uses whisky is actionable if it will lead even an appreciable fraction of readers to regard the plaintiff with contempt 4 and that to call a married woman a whore is defamatory even though the acts of adultery proved were with one and the same person only46 In Unfair Trade the Zither case 47 was as neat as possible an illus tration of the distinction between actionable deception of the customer by imitation of the authorship and nonactionable imi tation of the mechanism

rights of composers and it let loose a tumultuous and needless struggle in the halls of Congress when legislation to correct it was opposed by the ruthless ones who desired to grow rich on the unrewarded genius of others And to the philistine and unimaginative assertion in the majority opinion These musical tones are not a copy which appeals to the eye it was sufficient for him to answer irrefragably The result is to give to copyright less scope than its rational signifi cance and the ground on which it is granted seems to me to demand   The ground of copyright is that the person to whom it is given has invented some new collocation of visible or audible points  of liner colors sounds or words The restraint is directed against reproducing this collocation    One would expect that if it was to be protected at all that collocation would be protected according to what was its essence i e   not only the invention   but the result which gives to the invention its meaning and worth    On principle any thing that mechanically reproduces that collocation of sounds ought to be held a copy or if the statute is too narrow ought to be made so by a further act except so far as some extraneous consideration of policy may oppose 50 In Proprietary Damage one of his earliest opinions 51 gave an interesting opportunity to bring to bear some of that historical learning which he had just given to the world in The Common Law here on the question how far a Ibailee can recover for injury to the bailed chattel and the opinion shows that history was never allowed by him to enslave

has ever since lightened and relieved the pains of scientific fever in this locus There are however few opin ions in which the nicest questions of principle come to be dissected In the CoalHole case  which was indeed his very first opin ion in a tort case the difference was emphasized between that active causation which is generally required for liability and that inaction which can make liable only by exception and here by statute Passing over some related topics55 the most interesting opinions are found in the field of Remoteness of Consequence and Acting at Peril Remoteness The LessorandLessee opinions 51 are a most en lightening series they give him good illustration for a favorite doctrine that the general tendency has been to look no further back than the last wrongdoer

men often creep into the commission and to arm them with such arbi trary powers would be of the most terrible consequence And so it is a satisfaction to find that our Justice has left his im press here also to guide the future And after all it is perhaps these trifling cases of a yeomans plowhorse in the obscure village of Rehoboth Massachusetts that have given the greatest zest to our Justice amidst the lucubration of tedious records and the balancing of acute arguments Himself has somewhere said it and it is a passage which confers a perdur able doctorate of dignity upon the daily judicial task My keenest interest is excited not by what are called great ques tions and great cases but by little decisions which the common run of selectors would pass by because they did not deal with the Constitution or a telephone company yet which have in them the germ of some wider theory and therefore of some profound interstitial change in the very tissue of the law The men whom I should be tempted to commemorate would be the originators of transforming thought They often are half obscure because what the world pays for is judgment not the original mind  This day marks the fact that all thought is social is on its way to action that to borrow the expression of a French writer every idea tends to become first a catechism and then a code and that according to its worth his unhelped meditation may one day mount a throne and without armies or even with them may shoot across the world the electric despotism of an unresisted power John H Wigmore NORTHWESTERN UNrVERSITY LAW SCHOOL

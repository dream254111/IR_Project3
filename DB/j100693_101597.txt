A SULLEN AND SERVILE ADDICTION TO BARE ANTIQUITY AND ESTEEMS HIM TO BE TRULY WISE WHO NEITHER ADMITS FALSITIES UPON THE SOLE ACCOUNT OF BEING ANCIENT NOR EXCLUDETH TRUTHS BECAUSE OF NOVELTY BUT GIVETH

IMMODICAE VACUATIONIS CAUSAE C IN THE SECOND DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE CONSENT OF MANY PARTS OF THE BODY WITH THE WOMB HE FIRST DECLARETH THAT HE UNDERSTANDS BY THIS CONSENT NOTHING ELSEBUT THAT THE PARTS ARE AT ONCE AFFECTED TOGETHER FROM ONE PART PRINCIPALLY AFFECTED AND COMMUNICATING THAT AFFECTION TO OTHERS THEN HAVING EXPLODED THE COMMON OPI NIONS TOUCHING THE CAUSES OF THIS SYMPATHYHE OFFERS HIS OWNVIZ THE VICINITY OF THE PARTSAND THE COMMUNITY AND STRUCTURE OF THE VESSELSBY WHICH THE VITIATED LIQUORS OF THE BODY BEING CONVEYED FROM ONE PART TO ANOTHERMAY THERE EXCITE THE SAME OR DIFFERENT AFFECTIONSBUT BECAUSE THIS WAY OF SYMPATHISING BY VESSELS HATH MANY CONSIDERABLE AND UNOBVIOUS VARIETIES HE TAKES PAINS TO EX AMINE THEM AT LARGE AND TO GIVE A SCHEME OF THE WHOLE OECONOMY OF THE BODY OF THE PERFECTER ANIMALS CONSIDERING THE DIVERSITY AND VARIOUS USES OF THE VESSELS AND THE NECESSITY OF MOTION AND SENSE DEPENDING FROM THE BRAINTHE ANIMAL SPIRITS AND THE SY STEM OF THE NERVES WHICH BEING DISPERSED THROUGH THE WHOLE BODY2077 BODY CANNOT BUT PRODUCE THIS CONSENT OF PARTS FOR THE CLEARER EXPLICATION OF WHICH HE GIVES AN ACCOMPT OF THE ORDER AND DE PENDENCY OF THE VESSELS BY WHICH THE VARIOUS JUYCES ARE DISTRI BUTED THROUGH THE BODY AND FROM ALL THESE TOGETHER TAKING IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE PARTS HE DEDUCETH FIRST IN GENERAL THE MAN NERHOW ANY ONE PARTBEING AFFECTEDCOMMUNICATETH ITS AFFECTION TO OTHERS AND THEN IN PARTICULAR HOW THE SCITUATION AND THE CONNEXION OF THE WOMB WITH OTHER PARTS IS SUBJECT TO PRODUCE THE LIKE EFFECTS WHERE HE EXSPATIATETH TO DECLAREHOW THAT FROM THE DEPRAVATION OF THE UTERINE FERMENT AND BLOUD SO MANY SO VARIOUS AND SO HORRID DISEASES AND SYMPTOMS ARISE TO ALL WHICH HE ADDS THE SOLUTION OF THESE TWO QUESTIONS 1 WHY SWEET SMELLS RAISE HYSTERIQUE PASSIONS AND SAETID ONESREMEDY THE SAME 2 WHY THERE IS SO SPECIAL A CONSENT OF THE WOMB WITH THE BREASTS CONCERNING BOTH WHICH WE REFER THE READER TO THE AUTHOR HIM SELF AND PROCEED TO THE THIRD DISSERTATION IN WHICH HE INQUIRES WHENCE IT IS THAT MILK IS THE BEST ALIMENT OF THE BODY AND TO SATISFIE THIS INQUIRY HE PRESUPPOSETH THAT THE PROXIME NOURISHMENT IS TO BE AS LIKE AS MAY BE TO THE BODY TO BE NOURISHTAND THAT WE SUBSIST BY THE SAME THINGS OF WHICH WE ARE GENERATED AND THAT THE FAETUS IS FED IN THE WOMB NOT WITH BLOUD BUT A MILKY JUYCE TAKEN IN AT THE MOUTH AND SEVERD FROM THE BLOUD IN THE UTERUS BY THE PLACENTA AS A STRAINER AS TIS IN THE BREASTS BY THE GLANDULS AND TUBES DE SIGNED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AND HAVING CONCLUDED THEREUPON THAT MEATS DO NOT NOURISH BEFORE THEY ARE CONVERTED INTO A MIL KY LIQUOR HE ANALYSETH MILK AND FINDING THAT ITS FATTY TERRE STRIAL AND SEROUS PARTS MAY BE EASILY MIXED SEPARATED AGAIN AND MADE A FIT MATTER FOR THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY THE SEROUS PART THEREOF WHICH IS ALSO NITROUS BEING A VERY PROPER VE HICLE TO CONVEIGH IT THOROUGH THE VESSELS HE INFERS THAT IT IS THE MOST CONVENIENT FOODNOT FOR CHILDREN ONLY BUT FOR GROWN PEO PLE ALSO BUT BECAUSE HE WAS AWARE OF DIVERS OBJECTIONS AGAINST THIS DOCTRINE ESPECIALLY THOSE TWO THAT ARE TAKEN FROM THE DOU BLE PRINCIPLE OF OUR GENERATION THE BLOUD AND THE GENITAL SEED AND FROM THE TWO SORTS OF PARTS OF THE BODY SPERMATICK AND SAN GUINEOUS HE ENDEAVORS TO REMOVE BOTH AS MAY BE SEEN IN THE BOOK IT SELF WHERE DO OCCUR SUNDRY CURIOUS AND CONSIDERABLE A NATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS GROUNDED UPON THE LEARNED DR WHARTONS BOOK OF GLANDULS AND PROVINGTHAT THE C C 2 MATERNAL2078 MATERNAL BLOUD IS NEITHER THE MATTER OF THE ALIMENT OF THE FAETUS NOR THAT OF WHICH IT IS FIRST FORMED ALL WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED AND CONFIRMED FROM THE PHAENOMENA IN OVIPAROUS ANIMALS WHOSE YOUNG ONES BRED IN EGGS RECEIVE NO BLOUD AT ALL FROM THEIR DAMS BUT AS TO THE SUCCESSIVE CHANGES MADE IN MEATSFIT FOR NUTRITION AND THE PRODUCTION OF VARIOUS JUYCESHE REPRESENTS THEM THUSAF TER THAT THE CHYLEPRODUCED OUT OF MEAT AND DRINK IN THE STOMACH HATH PASSED TO THE HEART THEN THE FINEST AND MOST SPIRITUOUS PARTS THEREOF ARE CHANGED INTO THE RED PART OF THE BLOUD SUCH POR TIONS AS ARE DISPOSED NEXT ARE TURNED INTO BILEAND OTHER HUMORS THE REMAINDER IS BY IT ERATED FERMENTATIONS WITH THE BLOUD IN THE HEART FURTHER DIGESTED AND PERFECTED AND BY BEING IN MANY PLACES PERCOLATED AND LEAVING BEHIND ITS SEROSITY ACQUIRETH A GLU TINOUS AND FIBROUS NATURE LIKE MILK FITTEST FOR NUTRITION SO THAT HE CONCLUDES UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE BEING NO PART OF THE BODY WHICH IS NOT GENERATED OF THE SEED AND CONSE QUENTLY THE SEMINAL MATTER BEING THE NEAREST ALIMENT OF THE SAME AND NOTHING OF THINGS OUTWARDLY TAKEN IN HAVING A GREATER COG NATION WITH IT THAN MILK THIS LIQUOR IS TO BE ESTEEMD THE BEST A LIMENT AND THE PROPEREST TO REPAIR TABID AND DECAYED PERSONS II H I S T O R I AE G E N E R A L I S I N S E C T O R U M JO HANNIS SWAMMERDANI PARS PRIMA ULTRAJECTI A 1669IN 4 THIS CURIOUS AND PHILOSOPHICAL BOOK WRITTEN IN THE BELGICK TONGUE TREATETH CHIEFLY OF THESE THREE THINGS FIRST IT LAYS DOWN THE GROUND OF ALL NATURAL CHANGES IN INSECTS DECLARING THAT BY THE WORD CHANGE IS NOTHING ELSE TO BE UNDER STOOD BUT A GRADUAL AND NATURAL EVOLUTION AND GROWTH OF THE PARTS NOT ANY METAMORPHOSIS OR TRANSFORMATION OF THEM WHICH GROWTH IS HERE MADE TO RESEMBLE NOT ONLY THE INCREASE OF OTHER ANIMALS BUT ALSO THE BUDDING KNITTING AND SPREADING OF PLANTS AND HERE THE AUTHOR HAVING TAKEN NOTICE THAT WHEREAS ANTIENT AND FAMOUS WRITERS HAVE ESTEEMD AND CALLED THE NYMPHA AMONG INSECTS THE CHANGE OF THAT WORM WHICH CARRIES THE PROPER SHAPE OF THE FUTURE LITTLE ANIMALAND THE CHRYSALIS OR AURELIA THE CHANGE OF THAT CATERPILLAR WHICH SHEWS NO PARTS AT ALL OF THE ANIMAL TO COMEHAVINGI SAY NOTED THIS DESIRES THE READER TO OBSERVETHAT WHEREAS HE IS ABLE TO DISCERN AND TO SHEW ALL THE PARTS OR MEM BERS OF THE FUTURE ANIMALCLEAS WELL IN THE CHRYSALISAS THE NYMPHA HE M KES NO OTHER DIFFERENCE AMONGST THEM BUT THIS THAT SINCE THE2079 THE PARTS IN A CHRYSALIS ARE NOT SO PLAINLY DISCERNABLE TO OUR VIEW AS THOSE IN A NYMPHAE AND BECAUSE A CHRYSALIS DOES SOMETIMES APPEAR OF A GILTCOLOUR WHICH HE HATH NOT HITHERTO OBSERVD IN A NYMPHA HE CALLS THE NYMPHA BARELY BY THE NAME OF PUPPET AND THE CHRYSALIS BY THAT OF GILTPUPPET THE DISTINCTION OF WHICH IS MADE VERY CLEAR BY THE NEAT AND ACCURATE CUTS ANNEXED AND THEIR EXPLICATION IN THIS FIRST PART IS SET FORTH THE MANNERHOW THE WORMS AND CATERPILLARS TURN INTO PUPPETS AND SHEWEDTHAT SOME INSECTS COME PERFECT OUT OF THE EGG AND NEVER OUT OF A PUPPET THAT THE PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCE OF THE WORMANIMALCULA THAT TURN INTO PUPPETS CONSISTS IN THIS THAT SOME HAVE FEET SOME HAVE NONE THAT THE BREAST OF THE FEETLESS WORMS IS NEVER CHANGED THAT THE SIX FOREFEET OF THE WORMS WITH MANY OR FEW FEET ARE NEVER CHANGED OR TRANSPOSED THAT THE WINGS HORNS FEET C GROW UP UNDER THE SKIN BY DEGREES THAT IN ALL WORMS HE CAN EASILY SHEW THE SAID PARTS UNDER THE SKIN AF FIRMING TO HAVE DONE IT ACTUALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF SEIGNIEUR MAGALOTTI AND MONSIEUR THEVENOT TWO VERY INTELLIGENT AND CAUTIOUS PERSONS AND THAT EVEN A FROG COMES FORTH INTO A PUPPET SECONDLY THIS BOOK UNDERTAKETH TO MAKE IT OUT HOW THE TRUE GROUND OF THE NATURAL CHANGES OR THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NYMPHA AND AURELIA HATH BEEN OBSCURED AND MARRED SHEWING WITHAL HOW IT IS TO BE CLEARED AND RESTORED AGAIN WHERE HE AFFIRMSTHAT MOUFET AND OTHERS DO ERRE A BOUT THE AURELIAE MAKING IT NEITHER AN EGG NOR AN ANIMAL AND THAT HARVEY MISTAKETH CALLING THE AURELIAWHICH INDEED IS THE ANIMAL IT SELF AN EGG AND AFFIRMING THAT BLOUDLESSE ANIMAELCULA ARE PRODUCED OUT OF AURELIAS BY TRANSFORMATION WHEREAS THE CHANGE HAPPENING IN THE PUPPETS IS NOTHING ELSE BUT AN EVAPORATION OF THE SUPERFLUOUS MOISTURE FURTHER THAT GOEDARTUS ERRES HOLDING THAT A CATERPILLAR MAY CHANGE BE FORE HER TIME AND THAT IF SHE SO CHANGES SHE THEN PRODUCETH ANOTHER ANIMAL CONTRARY WHEREUNTO OUR AUTHOR AFFIRMS THAT THESE ANIMAL CULA WHICH THE SAID GOEDARTUS MENTIONS AS CHANGING AGAINST THE ORDER OF NATURE DO ALWAYS COME FORTH IN THAT MANNER VIZ THE MALE WITH WINGS AND THE FEMALE WITHOUT THEM OBSERVING FURTHER THAT CATERPILLARS EARLY FORBEARING TO EAT COME ONLY TO TURN INTO SMALLER BODIED ANIMALS AND ADDING THAT THEY MAY CHANGE WHEN THEY WILL AND THAT THE ANIMALS WHEN ONCE CHANGED DO NEVER GROW BIGGER AND FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPAGATION OF THESE ANIMALCULA HE IS OF OPINION THAT WE MAY AR RIVE TO THAT OF THE PROPAGATION OF THE REST OF ANIMALS WHERE HE DE CLARETH HIS SENTIMENT THAT THERE IS NO GENERATION IN NATURE BUT ONLY A PRODUCTION BY THE GROWING OF PARTS ADDING THIS ASSERTION THAT HE IS ABLE BOTH TO SHEW ALL THE PARTS OF A BUTTERFLY IN A CATERPILLAR AND TO MAKE THE CHANGE OF THE CATERPILLAR TO PROCEED LEISURELY AND SO TO STOP IT IN ITS CHANGE THAT IT SHALL APPEAR HALF CATERPILLAR AND HALF AURELIA WHICH HE FAITHHE HATH ACTUALLY PERFORMED BEFORE THE NOW GREAT DUKE OF TASCANY THIRDLY THIS AUTHOR REDUCETH ALL CHANGES OF INSECTS SOME FEW EX CEPTED WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGETH HE DOTH NOT YET WELL UNDERSTAND INTO FOUR CLASSES OR RANKS WHICH ARE DISCRIMINATED BY FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS OF PRODUCTION2080 PRODUCTION CHANGE AND GROWTH THE FIRST RANK BY HIM CALLED NYM PHA ANIMAL HATH A LITTLE ANIMAL FULLY FORMED IN THE EGG WHICH AFTER THE EVAPORATION OF THE SUPERFLUOUS MOISTURE COMES FORTH PERFECT AND SO GROWETH UP SUCH AS THE LOWSE AND FLEAE C THE SECOND CALLED NYMPHA VERMICULUS HATH THE PARTS OF THE INSECT IMPERFECTLY SHAPED IN THE EGG AND AFTER HATCHING ACQUIRES ITS PERFECTION VISIBLY BY OUTWARD FOOD SUCH AS THE LOCUST AND CRICKETC THE THIRD CALLED NYMPHACHRYSALIS OR AU RELIA OBTAINS AFTER HATCHING ITS PERFECTION DARKLY AND NOT TILL THE LAST CASTING OF THE SKIN SUCH AS THE EMMET AND NIGHTBUTTERFLYSO THAT IN THE SECOND AND THIRD CLASSIS NOT A PERFECT ANIMAL BUT A WORM PRECEDES THE GROWING UP OF THE PARTS YET WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT IN THE SECOND THE LITTLE CREATURE GROWETH UP MANIFESTLY WHICH IN THE THIRD IS DONE OB SCURELY THE FOURTH CALLED NYMPHA VERMIFORMIS REMAINS ALWAYS SHUT UP IN THE SKIN OF THE WORM WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF DISCERNING THE PARTS TILL CASTING BOTH SKINS AT ONCE IT BECOMS CAPABLE OF GENERATION SUCH AS THE FLY IN THE EXPLICATION AND DEDUCTION OF ALL WHICH DIFFERENCES THE AUTHOR TAKETH NOTICE OF MANY REMARKABLE PARTICULARS EG THAT THE INSECTS WHICH COME PERFECT OUT OF THEIR EGGS CHANGE ONLY BY CASTING THEIR SKIN AND THOSE THAT COME FORTH IMPERFECT DO BESIDES SKINCASTING GROW UP BY FOOD TO BECOME NYMPHAS OR PUPPETS THAT THOSE WHICH COMEPER FECT OR IMPERFECT OUT OF THE EGG ARE IN THE EGG FIRST LIKE PUPPETS AND UNDERGO BOTH OF THEM IN THE EGG ALL THE ALTERATIONS WHICH ANY INSECT UNDERGOETH IN THE PUPPET THAT THE PARTS OF PUPPETS PROTUBERATEMUCH LIKE THE BUDDING OF FLOWERS THAT THE CATERPILLAR IS THE BUTTERFLY IT SELF ONLY COVERED OVER WITH A MANTLE WHEREBY THE PARTS ARE KEPT FROM OUR DISCERNING THAT THE DOCTRINE OF SEIGNEUR MALPIGHI IN HIS DISSERTATION DE BOMBYCE DEDICATED TO THE R SOCIETY CONCERNING THE CHANGE OF BUTTERFLYES IS TRUETHAT INNUMERABLE INSECTS FLY ABOUT AND FEED BY NIGHT AS WELL AS OTHERS DO BY DAY THAT SNAILS DISCHARGE THEIR EXCREMENTS BY THE NECK AND ARE EACH OF THEM BOTH MALE AND FEMALE THAT FROM CA TERPILLARS FEEDING ON SUCH AND SUCH PLANTS CONJECTURES MAY BE DRAWN CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT OF THE RESPECTIVE QUALITIES OF THEM IT BEING VERY PROBABLE THAT IF THOSE CREATURES DO EAT OF SEVERAL PLANTS EACH SORT OF THOSE INSECTS BEING ESTEEMD TO FEED BUT ON ONE SORT OF VEGE TABLES THOSE PLANTS DO AGREE IN THEIR NATURE AND VERTUESC THOSE INSECTS WHICH THE AUTHOR CAN AS YET REDUCE TO NO CLASSIS ARE CICINDELA SCARABAEUS PILULARIUS SCOLOPENDRA HYDROCANTHARIS JULUS HYDROCANTHARIS MINIMUS CURCULTO SCORPIO III THE C R E E D OF M H O B B E S EXAMINED BY M TENISON LONDON 1670 IN 8 PASSING BY THE SEVERAL PARTICULARS WHICH CONCERN MORALITY AND POLICY DISCUSSED IN THIS BOOK AS NOT BELONGING TO THESE TRACTS WHICH ARE PRINCIPALLY2081 PRINCIPALLY DESIGNED TO GIVE AN ACCOMPT OF SUCH OCCURRENCES AS ARE OF A PHYSICAL AND MATHEMATICAL NATURE WE SHALL ONLY TAKE NOTICE OF THE IN GENIOUS CONFUTATION MADE BY THIS AUTHOR OF WHAT M HOBBES HATH DE LIVERED CONCERNING THE RATIONAL SOUL AND PERCEPTION IN MATTER WHERE IN MY OPINION IT IS STRONGLY EVINCED THAT THE SOUL OF MAN IS SOMETHING ELSE THAN THE ORGANIZED BODY IN DUE MOTION AND THAT TIS ALTOGETHER UNCONCEIVABLE AND THEREFORE MOST UNPHILOSOPHICAL THAT MATTER SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF PERCEPTION COGITATION AND DISCOURSE IN THE DOING OF WHICH OUR AUTHOR DESCENDS TO PARTICULARS MAKING IT OUT THAT SENSATION IS NOT MADE BY MOTION OR REACTION IN MEER MATTER NOR THAT IMAGI NATION MEMORY MUCH LESS REASON ARE MEERLY MECHANICAL REFUTING AL SO THAT DOGME WHICH MAKETH REASON NOTHING BUT AN APT JOYNING OF NAMES ALL WHICH SEEMS TO BE PERFORMED WITH SO MUCH FORCE THAT IT AP PEARES NOT WHAT IN REASON CAN BE REJOYNED THERETO WHICH YET IS NOT SAID WITHOUT A READY SUBMISSION TO BETTER JUDGMENTS IV FRANCISCI JOSEPHI BURRHI EPISTOLAE DUAE AD THOMAM BARTHOLINUM HAFNIAE 1669 IN 4 THIS SMALL TRACT BEING BUT VERY LATELY SENT OUT OF DENMARK TO THE PUBLISHER HE THOUGHT FIT TO GIVE FORTHWITH THE FOLLOWING ACCOMPT OF IT THESE TWO LETTERS OF SIGNEUR BURRHI ARE AN ANSWER TO TWO OTHERS WHICH M BARTHOLIN HAD WRITTEN TO HIM TOUCHING SUNDRY CONSIDERABLE AND CURIOUS SUBJECTS OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND MEDICINE IN THE FORMER HE ENDEAVOURS TO EXPLAIN HOW THE BRAIN IS FORMED AND WHAT KIND OF SUBSTANCE IT IS IN THE DOING OF WHICH HE OBSERVETH THAT AS MANY SALTS DISSOLVED TOGETHER IN COMMON WATER ARE SEVERD BY A SIMPLE DISTILLATION AND AS DIVERS METTALS MELTED TOGETHER INTO ONE MASSE ARE UNMIXED FROM ONE ANOTHER WHEN A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HEAT IS GIVEN THEM SO THE DIFFERENT PARTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE SEED ALTHOUGH THEY BE SO BLENDED TOGETHER THAT TIS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH THEM DO DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM ONE ANOTHER WHEN THEY ARE AGITATED BY A COMPETENT HEAT AND TAKING THE SITUATION WHICH IS NATURAL TO THEM GIVE RISE TO THE SEVERAL ORGANS OF THE BODY THE DIRECT AND THE MOST MASSY BY THEIR WEIGHT GOING TO THE CENTER FORM THE HEART THE SPONGIOUS THE LUNGS THE BITUMINOUS THE LIVER AND THE FATTY AND OILY AS THE HIGHEST RISING A BOVE THE REST FORM THE BRAINC WHERE HE TAKES NOTICE THAT HIPPOCRATES HOLDS THE BRAIN TO HAVE LITTLE OF OYLINES IN IT BECAUSE IT WILL NOT FLAME WHEREAS HE ASSURES THAT HAVING DISTILLED THE BRAIN OF A CALF HE DREW FROM IT A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF OYL WHICH TO NOTE THAT BY THE BY BEING APPLYED OUTWARDLY IS BY HIM RECOMMENDED AS EXCELLENT TO AP PEASE THE PAINS OF THE GOUT IN THE SAME LETTER HE AFFIRMS THAT IN THE BRAIN THERE IS MADE A CERTAIN VERY SUBTILE AND WELLSCENTED LIQUOR WHICH HE BELIEVES TO BE THE SEAT OF THE REASONABLE SOUL AND THAT THE WIT OF MEN DEPENDS ON THE TEMPER OF THIS LIQUOR RATHER THAN FROM THE CONFORMATION OF THE BRAIN WHICH HE CONFIRMS BY THE EXAMPLE OF ONE WHO BY TAKING GREAT STORE OF TOBACCO2082 HAD SO DRYED UP HIS BRAIN THAT AFTER HIS DEATH THERE WAS FOUND IN HIS HEAD BUT A VERY SMALL BLACK CLOD COMPOSED OF SUNDRY MEMBRANS AND YET HIS SOUL HAD NOT BEEN WANTING TO PERFORM HER FUNCTIONS TO THE LAST HE ALSO TAKES OCCASION TO DISCOURSE OF RESPIRATION ADVENTURING TO AFFIRM THAT RESPIRATION IS CAUSED BY DIVERS LIQUORS WHICH RISING THROUGH THE VEINS INTO THE HEART AND THERE FERMENTING SEND TO THE LUNGS SUCH VA PORS AS ATTRACT THE AIR FOR ILLUSTRATION WHEREOF HE SAITH THAT IF TO A GLASSBOWL HOLLOW AND WITH A SMALL HOLE YOU SODDER DIVERS PIPES OF GLASS HALF FULL OF DIFFERENT STRONG LIQUORS THE VAPOURS ELEVATED FROM THOSE PIPES IN THE GLASSBOWL WILL DRAW THE AIR AFTER THE SAME MANNER AS TIS DRAWN INTO THE LUNGS BY RESPIRATION IN THE OTHER LETTER HE TREATS OF THE WAY OF CURING SEVERAL DISTEMPERS OF THE EYES AND PARTICULARLY OF SOME SURPRIZING ONES CURED BY HIMSELF WHERE HE AFFIRMS THAT HAVING CUT ASUNDER THE APPLE OF THE EYE OF DIVERS ANIMALS AND SQUEESED OUT THE HUMORS EVEN THE CHRYSTALLIN IT SELF HE HATH RESTORED THE SIGHT TO THOSE ANIMALS AND THAT THE EYES OF THOSE BIRDS ON WHICH HE HAD MADE THIS EXPERIMENT LOOKED BETTER AND MORE VIVID THAN BEFORE AND THAT HE HAD PERFORMED THIS OPERATION UPON MANY PERSONS WITH SO MUCH SUCCESS THAT IN THEIR EYES THERE REMAINED NOT THE LEAST AP PEARANCE OF A SCAR AFTER THIS RELATION HE IS NOT SHY TO TEACH THE WAY OF MAKING THIS OPERATION ADDING THE CAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED THEREIN AND WITHALL THE REMEDY IT SELF WHICH CONSISTS CHIEFLY IN A CERTAIN WATER OF CELONDINE AND A PHLEGME OF VITRIOL OF MARS ON THE OCCASION OF TEACHING THE PREPARATION OF THIS REMEDY HE TAKETH NOTICE OF SEVERAL PARTICULARS PERHAPS NOT TO BE DESPISED FIRST THAT IF ABOUT A PINT OF WATER BE POURED ON TEN POUNDS OF FILINGS OF IRON FRESH AND FINE AND AFTER HAVING WELL STIRRD IT WITH ONES HAND YOU COVER THE VESSEL WHEREIN IT IS AND WRAP IT ABOUT WITH SOME DRY STUFF THESE FILINGS WILL WITHIN THE SPACE OF AN HOUR AND AN HALF FERMENT AND GROW HOT LIKE CALX VIVA SECONDLY THAT HAVING OFTEN QUENCHED IN WATER AN INGOT OF FINE GOLD HEATED RED HOT HE HATH FOUND THE WEIGHT OF THAT GOLD NOTA BLY DIMINISHT AND HAVING AFTERWARDS SUFFERED THE WATER TO EVAPORATE DRAWN A LITTLE GOLD THENCE WHICH HE SAITH SHEWS THAT THE MOST SUBTILE PARTS OF THE GOLD PASS INTO THE LIQUORS WHEREIN IT IS QUENCHED WHENCE IT IS HE ADDS THAT SUCH LIQUORS HAVE ADMIRABLE VERTUES TO CURE MANY DISEASES AND AMONGST OTHERS HE PRETENDS THAT IN DYSSENTERIES THERE IS NO BETTER REMEDY THAN ROSEWATER WHEREIN GOLD HATH BEEN QUENCHED THIRDLY THAT IN THE RESOLUTION OF SIMPLES AN EXCELLENT MEANS OF PRE SERVING THEIR PROPER VIRTUES IS INSTEAD OF USING FIRE OR ANY OTHER STRANGE HEAT WHICH MIGHT ALTER THEIR VERTUES TO EMPLOY ONLY THE WARMTH OF AN HOTBED MADE OF THE PUTREFACTION OF THE HERBS OF THE SAME SPECIES WITH

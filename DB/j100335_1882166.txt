ex periment has been this year tried in Toronto Canada The city authorities assumed for a time the management of the street railway The steps which led to the experiment and the details of the case are interesting from an economic point of view as indicating a secondary stage in the development of this peculiar industry In 1861 the legislature of Ontario passed an act incorpo rating the Toronto Street Railway Company which at once began operations It was thus one of the earliest charters granted to street railways in America The charter while not giving an absolute monopoly provided that  if any other party proposed to construct railways on unoccupied streets the chartered company should first have the option of con structing such railway on the conditions proposed but if such preference were not accepted within one month the corpora tion might grant the privilege to other parties This how ever with one unimportant exception resulted in the char tered company always building such lines The only returns to the city for the franchise were a an annual fee of 5 on each car h the maintenance of the roadbed between the rtils and eighteen inches beyond on either side c ordinary taxes The privilege was for thirty years at the end of which time the city might  assume the ownership of the railways and all real and personal property in connection with the working thereof at a value to be determined by arbitration and on this right not being exercised when that period expired it might be exercised at the end of any subsequent five years These clauses have been the basis of a lawsuit by the com pany to compel the city to include in the arbitrators award the value of the different properties such as stables yards etc not at their ordinary prices but at their value for street railway purposes that is on the assumption that the fran chise was perpetual This suit is not yet settledNOTES AND 3IEMORANDA 99 Whether or not the Toronto of 1861 with its population of fortytwo thousand was too small for successful street railway traffic the company failed in 1869 Its franchise was then transferred to another company which maintained control until the present year when the city exercised its option of terminating the charter The vagueness of the terms of the charter of 1861 and its silence upon many important points regarding the relations of the company to the city authorities points which could not be anticipated at that early date in street railway enterprise but which became important on the rapid growth of the city after 1870 and the corresponding development on the part of the railway gave rise to serious differences and acute friction between the city and the comn pany Thus the maintenance of the companys part of the roadbed was a prolific source of complaint At the instance of the city acts were passed by the Ontario legislature in 1876 and 1877 providing that the company should use the same kind of paving as that used by the city in the other part of the street and that if they failed to do so the city engineer might do the paving charging it to the company This did not work well Accidents occurred from the defective pav ing and the city attempted to saddle the resulting damages upon the company The company retorted that the adjoin in roadbed was inappropriate for cartrack paving and that in any event the responsibility of repairing such track when defective lay with the city engineer who after making the repairs should then collect from the company their cost and the company finally claimed 10000 damages from the city for permitting defective paving to continue unrepaired The city in turn instituted a suit against the company in 1886 After prolonged legal proceedings lasting some two years and a half during which the case was decided in various ways by successive courts of appeal the matter was finally settled in 1889 by an agreement that the city should maintain all the roadway and the company should pay an annual rental of 600 per mile of single track Another question of dispute was whether the company was obliged to provide in addition to the driver a conductor on every car This also gave rise to a suit which was carried up100 QUARTEILLY JOURNAL OF ECONO3fICS through the courts with varying results The onlpanys con duct in piling the winters snow and ice upon the adjoining roadway its refusal to grant transfer tickets and to heat cars in winter its treatment of its men culminating in strikes with resulting discomfort to the public welee among the causes that continually directed attention from 1884 to 1888 to street railway matters and proved the unyielding nature of the company The citizens were goaded first into interest then anger and finally a determination to put an end to the franchise in 1891 when as has been pointed out the first opportunity of longg so presented itself This conclusion might have been arrived at in any event but public opinion could not have been so effectually aroused and the wonder ful unanimity displayed could not otherwise have been at tained Accordingly the Provincial Legislature of Ontario at the request of the city authorities enacted in 1889 that the cor poration of the city of Toronto may with the consent of the ratepayers borrow whatever sum may be required to enable the said corporation to acquire the ownership of the railways of the Toronto Street Railway Company at the expiration of the current term of the said companys franchise and may issue debentures therefor and may manage and operate the said railways or having acquired the said property may sell lease or otherwise dispose of the same Ill June 1890 three arbitrators were appointed one by the city one by the com pany these two selecting a third They were to determine the value of the property according to the conditions of the charter of 1861 and subsequent agreements After a minute examina tion of claims as argued by the best counsel of the Province and extending over more than half a year two of the three arbitrators the companys appointee not concurring agreed on a report giving as the value of the companys assets 1453788 This sum differed materially from the companys estimate of 5000000 and the citys estimate of F500000 being very nearly a geometric mean three times the one one third the other In making their award a majority of the arbitrators decided ag ainst the companys claim of a perpetual franchise a claim founded upon the clause of the charter of 1861 quoted near the beginning of this paperNO TES AND 2MEMfORANDA 101 The finding of the arbitrators was handed in on April 15 1891 The thirty years of the old agreement had expired on the previous 15th of March That date found the city fathers quite unready to assume control so that the old company was allowed on the same conditions as before to continue till May 15 But when the city had fully determined nearly two years before to end the companys charter in 1891 why was it not ready when the time came  Partly because the arbitra tioii dragged on to an unexpected length and its results were necessary before tenders from new companies could be adver tised for partly because the city authorities expecting to hand the road directly to a new company did not perfect arrangements for civic control until too late This was not the fault of the advocates of municipal management who not being remarkable for reticence in expressing their opinions and being supported by some workmens clubs and the single tax association seemed for a time to have an importance that the sequel showed they did not possess On the advent of warm weather bringing with it the lucra tive season of street railway traffic the popular demand for the displacing of the old company became too strong to be withstood Accordingly on May 20 a committee of the city aldermen after a certain amount of legal skirmishing with the defunct company took possession of the street railway property The former employees were retained and the for mer manager was made head of the new civic department under a Street Railway Committee of the City Council As the old conditions were retained in every respect it was not long before discontent arose Employees expected shorter hours now that the city was managing the road citizens looked for a better service a system of transfers and many minor improvements Accidents happened and suits for damages were brought against the city Some observers thought that repairs were not kept up as well as formerly and the Toronto press darkly hinted at aldermanic favoritism and jobbery Some went so far as to say that if the city did not soon dis pose of the franchise it would have a worthless franchise to dispose of Yet in truth the returns were as treat as in for mer years and accidents no more frequent the head of the102 QUARTERLY JOURhNAzL OF ECONVOMICS new department the former manager of the old company testifying to the similarity in repairing and managing the road Nevertheless the public became distrustful and it is tolerably certain that few ratepayers regretted it when on September 1 the street railway and its responsibilities were handed over to a new company for a term of years The negotiations by which this transfer was brought about are interesting to the student of civic politics In alvertising for tenders the city council attached several conditions of sale which are important from an economic point of view as indicating the position assumed by the municipality after ma ture deliberation These conditions were 1 The franchise offered was subject to the italicised por tion of the next section to be a monopoly of surface street railway traffic for a period of twenty years renewable on the sfame terms for a further period of ten years if the legislation necessary could be obtained The perpetual franchise difficulty of the old charter was expressly guarded against The tenderers were to pay the city for the property the same sum that the city paid the o0l company 2 The city was to maintain the whole roadway but not the rails and substructure required for the railway the tenderers to pay the city annually i8O0 per mile of single track to obtain the city engineers consent to anyi change or extension of track to ettendl cuy line wchen asked to do so by the city on plain of having the city grant the construction ani operation of such extension to another company andl gradually to introduce an electric or other new system of motor 3 Removal of ice and snow from the track a system of transfers thle providing of conductors on all cars the heating of cars and so on were provided for so that the painful ex perience of former years has borne fruit 4 Last and perhaps most interesting were the provisions for treatment of employees and for cheap tickets No erw ployee shall be compelled to work in the service of the rail way for a longer period than ten hours per day or than sixty hours per week or on more than six days per week and no adult employee in the service of the railway shall be paid less than fifteen cents per hour No Sunday streetcars shouldNOTES AND MEMORANDA 103 be run until a popular vote called for them As to tickets and fares it was required that there should be 1 ordinary tickets five cents each six for twentyfive cents or twenty five for 1 2 workmens tickets good from 530 AM to 8 AOIr and from 5 PMv to 630 Iu eight for twentyfive cents 3 schoolchildrens tickets good from 8 AM to 5 PM except Saturdays ten for twentyfive cents These points were all matters for keen discussion and were finally adopted by good majorities Thus the provision for workmens tickets was embodied in the committees report was referred back to the committee by the council was the subject of much comment by the city press was returned by the committee to the council and after the defeat of amend ments to strike it out or to substitute seven or nine in place of eight tickets was finally adopted by a vote of twentytwo to twelve After arranging the foregoing specifications the city ad vertised for tenders in accordance with them They were to take the shape of so mulch per cent of the gross receipts from all sources of revenue of the street railway system or the tenderers might submit offers on their own terms Not receiving suitable offers at first the committee advertised again and on May 27 opened the three tenders received Two of the tenders were based on the city providing the money to change the present  horse  to an  electric  system and as the city discovered that the legislation of 1889 had not given it this moneyborrowing power but only power to buy the old railway system as it stood the committee called on the tenderers to amend their offers This they did and the three tenders known respectively as the Kiely the Kerr and the Miller tenders were on the 30th of June submitted to experts Public interest was now thoroughly aroused The news papers of Toronto arrayed themselves on one side or another Every citizen had his opinion It was soon seen that the Miller offer was not so good as the others and accordingly the strife between the Kiely and the Kerr supporters became all the keener About this time the charges and counter charges of  undue influence  and  corruption to which reference will presently be made began to assume definite104 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOM1TICS shape On July 13 the experts brought in their report on the tenders to which we shall now turn The tenders while intricate in some of the alternatives plre sented for consideration by the city had many features in common Accepting in toto the conditions laid down by the city and quoted above all the tenderers offered a percen tage of the gross annual receipts that percentage increasing as the receipts increased The details can be best presented in tabular form thus Miller Kerr Kiely Up to 1000000 7 78 8 per cent From 1000000 to 1500000 812 8158 10 on the additional 500000  1500000 2000000 1012 92 12 500000 2000000 3000000 15 104 1000000 3000000  5000000 23 1338 20  2000000 The Kerr tender offered at the same time to increase the above tender by fivesixths of one per cent for each two and a half per cent that operating expenses fell below sixty per cent of gross receipts until fifty per cent should be reached The gross receipts of the street railway in 1890 were about 730 000 and the operating expenses were probably about seventy per cent of the whole The experts estimated that the capitalized value at the end of thirty years of the amount receivable by the city under the foregoing tenders was Kiely 9530000 Kerr 8850000 Miller 8728000 Each of the tenderers put in numerous and widely differing alternative provisions Thus Kiely offered if the workmens tickets clause were struck from the specifications to pay the city two per cent additional on the amount of the gross receipts while Kerr offered if both workmens and school childrens cheap fares were abandoned to increase his bid by two and fiveeichths per cent of the gross receipts Each ten derer also presented offers in case the city would guarantee some or all of the street railway bonds The experts brought in their report on July 9 and on July 13 the street railway committee recommended to the mayor and aldermen the adoption of the Kiely tender as the best straight offer The contest then became warmer than ever Charges of  crookedness were openly made A section of the council maintained that none of the offers were goodNOTES AND MEMORANDA 105 enough that the street railway was progressing very well in the hands of the city officials and that new tenders should be called for Nevertheless on July 21 the council by a vote of 24 to 14 decided in favor of Kiely and on August 26 by an increased majority determined on the consummation of the contract An injunction that had been applied for to prevent the city authorities handing over the railway till the charges of corruption had been examined into came to naught Ac cordingly on September 1 the new charter embodying the above provisions was signed the bonds were transferred and the road was handed over with all due formalities to the Kiely syndicate ARTHUR H SINCLAIR TORONTO September 1891

French woman a few years ago on returning from a magnificent state festival given by M le ministre Millerand onetime socialist comrade Under the Restoration a Liberal was defined as an escaped coinvict Thirty years ago it was agreed that every Republican wore dirty linen and was careless of his fingernails Later the Socialist took the place of the Republican Next  The next has come The syndicalist exponent of the new revolutionary unionism has displaced the socialist as chief bogey of the bourgeois world And not oif the bourgeois world alone for the new movement is causing almost as much uneasiness to the parliamientary socialist as to the philistine France presents today the piquant spectacle of the accredited defenders of the Marxist faith acting as a moderating force and for their pains being labeled as reactionary2 One of the most vital and perplexing problems of contempo rary socialism is that of the relationship between the socialist 1 Seilhac Le monde socialiste p 309

POLITICAL ECONOMY party and the labor union In no two countries are the relations on the same footing In Germany close alliance with complete autonomy prevails the socialist party being recognized as the agent of the proletariat in the political field and the union in the economnic field In Great Britain after long holding aloof the trade unions have entered politics under socialist leadership with however such clogging and deadening effect on the revolu tionary movement that the more militant socialists of the Hynd man and Grayson type are waging war to the knife against the alliance In Belgium trade unions form piractically an integral part of the political organization on a par with cooperative and mutual associations In the United States politics has tradi tionally been barred from the union though the GompersBryan alliance in conjunction with the stimulus to radical action which recent court decisions have given may foreshadow a different future It is in France that the most interesting situation has devel oped There the new unionism or syndicalism though com mitted to the socialist ideal of collective organization of industry not only declines to be guided by the socialist party but refuses to cooperate on the German basis of autonomous control of separate fields For syndicalism is sufficient unto itself It will brook no rival in its task of freeing the proletariat from its chains recognize no other policy but its own Its creed in brief is that the working class must work out its own salvation by its own organs by direct and not by deputed action and that the syndicat or labor union chief of these organs is to be regarded not merely as an instrument for securing partial alleviations of the existing capitalist system or as a recruiting ground for social ist parties but as itself the instrument of revolution and the cell of the future social organism The Confederation Generale du Travail the organization which at present is the exponent of syndicalism is the outcome of a long and chequered development The growth and integra tion of labor unions has been a slow process in France the classic land of small industries The chief landmarks in the early years of the movement consist in the passing or abolition of legalFRENCH UNIONISM MILITANT I27 restrictions on tradeunion formation and activity From the Revolution until I864 trade unions were under the ban of the law and participation in a strike a crime punishable by heavy penalties In 1789 the National Assembly in its onslaught on all forms of mediaeval privilege abolished the trade guilds and corporations Two years later the famous Loi Le Chapelier imposed penalties on persons taking part in strikes or lockouts or becoming mem bers of trade unions whether of masters or of men In spite of its nominal impartiality the law clearly reveals above and beyond the faith in the doctrine of freedom of contract the assent of the assembly to the declaration of one of its members Cazales La nation cest la bourgeoisie The provisions of the Code Na poleon evidence the same bias While by Article 4I4 coalition among employers was forbidden if it had for its object the im proper and unjust reduction of wages Article 4I5 forbade union on the part of workmen to suspend obstruct or make more costly the operations of industry without any saving qualifications as to the justice or injustice of the proceedings The penalties prescribed were in the case of employers six days to one months imprisonment in the case of workmen one to three months imprisonment for the rank and file and two to five years for the ringleaders In I864 the government of the Sec ond Empire giving the sanction of law to the conditions which hlad arisen in spite of law amended the penal code legalizing unions with not more than twenty members permitting strikes or lockouts unless accompanied by violence or intimidation and equalizing the penalties prescribed for employers and workmen The law of I884 completed the unshackling permitting the for mation of unions of more than twenty members exercising the same similar or allied trades and also concerted actioin by unions of different trades The way was clear foir the open organization of unions and especially for federation The socialist parties were quick to seize theopportunity Each of the warring factions into which French socialism was divided was long in generals and colonels but short in rank and file the trade unions seemed to promise an excellent recruiting ground The Guesdists strong in the128 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY possession of the true Marxian faith martially disciplined ably led the Broussists urging communal autonomy and communal public ownership the Allemanists formed somewhat later by secession from the Broussists opposing both Guesdist dogmatism and Broussist opportunism advocating the general strike and aggressive union action the Blanquists living on the menmories of the Commune still faithful tio the old theory of a catastrophic revolutioneach of these parties sought in the next few years to organize the forces of labor and rally them to its flag The Guesdists were first in the field Their vigorous propa ganda and particularly their policy of penetration within the unions gave them a considerable following in the industrial north and in a labor congress held at Lyons in i886 they suc ceeded in organizing a National Federation of Trade Unions The federation was kept in strict subordination to the party It never manifested much independent vitality and after nine years flickering existence it passed away The secondary role which the Guesdists have throughout accorded to union action is sufficiently revealed in the official recommendation to the mem bers of the party to join a unionin order to spread the doctrine of socialism and recruit adherents for the programme and policy of the party3 With their chief rival thus backed by the National Federation the Broussists looked elsewhere for the voting suppoirt and moral backing they desired The founding of the Paris Labor Ex change in i886 gave them their opportunity This institution destined to play an important part in the French labor movement had been advocated by leading publicists among them the econo mist Molinari at intervals during the greater part of the century It was desired to provide a permanent meetingplace for the citys workers to serve as a center of labor activity and education and aid in coordinating the supply and demand of labor Its scope was thus defined by M Mesureur president of the municipal council of Paris in the report which led the council to set up the first exchange Without abandoning the platform of liberty of contract it is your right nay your duty to provide the workers means for contending with 3Compterendu du congres nationtal du parti ouvrier frangais de Lille i8goFRENCH UNIONISM MILITANT I29 capital on an equal and legal basis With common halls freely and permanently at their disposal the workers will be able to discuss more maturely and more exactly the many questions which concern their trade and affect their wages they will have for their aid and enlightenment every faculty for obtaining information and carrying on correspondence the data provided by statistics an economic industrial and commercial library and information as to the course of production in each industry not only in France but throughout the world4 With a central meetinghall and an annual subvention of 20000 francs provided by the municipality the Paris Labor Exchange at once became an Important factor in the union move ment Other cities sooln followed the example set by Paris by I892 the exchanges numbered fourteen by I895 thirtyfour and by I898 fiftyone By the latter year they had secured the affilia tion of over 70 per cent of French unionists The activities of the exchange meanwhile had not remained confined within the narrow limits set by M Mesureurs trustful and somewhat academic imagination Their educational and statistical func tions soon became of minor importance The functions of mutual insurance retained more realityaiding the meimbers to find employment giving them relief when out of work or dis abled by accident and particularly providing the viaticum or traveling fund to enable the workers to seek a position elsewhere Each exchange became the headquarters of an active campaign for unionizing the unorganized workers of the locality But it was as a center of revolutionary propaganda that the labor ex changes developed most significance Especially after the form ing of the Federation des Bourses du Travail in I892 and with the growing influence of the Broussists and Allemanists in their ranks they devoted themselves to spreading the gospel of the class struggle the general strike and abstention from parliamentary action5 Finally in I895 the year when the Guesdist federation passed out of existence there developed largely under Blanquist inspira tion still a third organization the Confederation Generale du Travail or the C G T as it has come to be familiarly known Committed to much the same doctrinal and practical programme Fernand Pelloutier Histoire des bourses du travail p 74 Pelloutier Revue politique et parlementaire XXI 493130 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY as the Federation des Bourses du Travail the new organization found it difficult for some years to get a footing It was only after I900 when death had removed the leading spirit in the rival body Fernand Pelloutier that it elbowed a place in the su1 Finally after many abortive attempts to amalgamate the two organizations the Congress of Montpellier in I902 arranged the incorporation of the FIederation in the C G T on favorable terms The Confederation Generale du Travail which thus became the undisputed central organization of French unionism consists of two autonomous sections In each the unit is the local trade or industrial union The battle between craft and industrial unionism it may be mentioned incidentally has resulted in France so far at least as the federal organization is concerned in the triumph of the latter type Since the Congress of Amiens in October i9o6 while the trade federations at present existing have not been eliminated only industrial federations are being admitted Locally the unions of all trades are grouped in the bourses du travail or labor exchanges and these organizations again unite to form the Federation des Bourses du Travail one of the main sections of the central body The bourses du travail at present number I35 and comprise 2500 unions Their task as has been noted above is to provide mutual aid to the members and to serve as a center for propaganda Of their success in the latter effort M Emile Pouget associate secretary of the C G T and one of the leading spirits in the movement writes It is the activity of the bourses of the south which is responsible for the penetration of syndicalism among the agricultural workers and the formation of numerous unions of peasant vinegrowers in central France it is the bourse of Bourges which has organized the wood cutters in the west it is the bourse at Brest which has stirred up Brittany hitherto untouched by the labor movement Again when a strike breaks out the bourses are the centers where the rebelling workers gather and if some united action is being organized manifesting the solidarity of the whole workingclass of the country  it is from them that the quickening summons radiates forth What is more they play an important part in 6 Pouget La Confderation G6nerale du Travail Paris igo8 p I7FRENCH UNIONISM MILITANT 13I the antimilitarism campaign they keep open house for the soldiers provide rest and comforts for them and counteract the harmful influences of the barracks7 Professionally the unions are grouped in national federa tions which again unite to form the second division of the C G T the section of the Industrial and Trade Federations There are at present over sixty federations included in the section of which the building trades printing metalworking textile anda recent acquisitionthe mining groups are the strongest Exclusive of the miners unions they comprise about 2500 locals In discussing the structure of these national federations Pouget notes that while a few of the oldest are organized on a strongly centralized basis the normal type is a federal union based on autonomous locals administered by a federal committee formed by one representative from each affiliated union This representative always subject to recall by his local remains by correspondence in permanent contact with the organi zation which has given him his mandate   The centralizations which in other countries kills the workers initiative and shackles the autonomy of the local union is repugnant to the French workingclass And it is this spirit of autonomy and federalismwhich will be the essential charac teristics of the economic societies of the futurethat gives to the French labor movement its profoundly revolutionary aspect8 The federal union of these two sections forms the confedera tion itself The administration is in the hands of three perma nent commissions a commission on strikes a financial or auditing commission and a commission in charge of the official journal the Voix du Peuple a general committee and a modestly named bureau composed of seven memberstwo secretaries from the federation section one from the bourse section one from each of the three permanent commissions and the treasurer It is this bureau which really controls the situation though professedly acting merely as the mouthpiece of the workers in the unions II It is not however the structure of the C G T but the spirit and doctrine which animate it that best repay attention The material for study is abundant Syndicalism has been fortunate 7Ibid p i6 8 Ibid p I9I32 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY in its expounders Pelloutier the most original and striking figure in the early days of the movement and Pouget Griffuelhes Delesalle and Yvetot among the presentday leaders have all been nmen of ready pens The most complete and systematic exposi tion of the movement on its theoretical side however is tobe found in the writings of a group of boiurgeoiis intellectuals This fact becomes significant in view of the emphatic and repeated insistence of the exponents of the theoiry that syndicalism is wholly a proletarian product which has gradually and almost unconsciously taken shape as a result of the experience and needs and habits of thought of the workers themselves differing herein from parliamentary socialism which is permeated through and through with the ideals and dogmas of bourgeois intellectuals According to M Pouget Syndicalism is not a deduction from some hypothetical system  it is the result of an historical investigation into facts and of their clear visioned interpretation One might well call it the outcome and the crowning achievement of a whole century of struggle waged by the work ing class against the middle class9 Pougets brother secretary M Griffuelhes maintains regarding syndicalism that it has never been guided by formulas or theoretical propositions Nor has it been the development of a policy which we had prepared beforehand I cannot too strongly insist on the fact that it has consisted simply in a series of daybyday efforts arising out of the events of yesterday   called f orth by the environment and by the spirit which has taken pos session of the working class10 One of the intellectuals themselves bears nervously protesting witness to the same effect Revolutionary syndicalism is the peculiar and original creation of the French workingclass     if we have had a r6le it has been simply the role of interpreters translators glossarists we have served as spokesmen nothing more11 As spokesmen then and nothing more prominence attaches to the names of Georges Sorel the subtle critic of Marxism Hubert Lagardelle the vigorous and clearheaded editor of Le mouvement socialiste and Edouard Berth one of his collabora 9 Pouget Les bases du syndicalisme p 3 10 Griffuelhes Laction syndicaliste p 8 1 Berth Le mouvemtent socialiste No I98 p 390FRENCH UNIONISM MILITANT 133 tors with Robert Michels in Germany and Arturo Labriola and Enrico Leone in Italy What syndicalism as thus expounded stands for may be most clearly seen by noting the points which differentiate it from other movements more or less akin It differs from pure and simple trade unionism in its revolutionary aim and its adherence to the classstruggle doctrine from orthodox socialism in its distrust of political action and counteremphasis on purely pro letarian weapons and institutions and from anarchism in its exclusively proletarian appeal and its stress on constructive measures2 Syndicalism differs from trade uniionism of the classic English type in aim in method and in spirit Its aim is revolutionary Nothing less than the complete overthrow of the capitalist system will content it Partial ameliorations of the wageearners lot may be accepted must in fact be demanded but all the time with a clear consciousness that no concession which it is in the power of the capitalist to grant can meet their just and full demand The interests of bourgeois and proletarian are irreconcilable and class war is the only possible issue The leading Italian theorist of the movement writes as follows The only reality which we recognize is the existence of the class strug gle the only end that we put before our minds is to deepen and intensify that reality as much as possible The tactics which we employ in the different countries are inspired by the necessity of intensifying the class struggle3 In method as will be noted later the difference is equally vital The syndicalist puts his trust not in wellfilled warchests as the English unions have done of old nor in the power of the ballot as they are doing of late It is part of his creed that a union fights best on a lean treasury and fights best without the intervention of parliamentary representatives The difference in spirit may be illustrated by a rather rhetorical passage in which M Griffuelhes contrasts French and German unionism What characterizes the French workman is his audacity and independ ence Nothing daunts him He is above all authority all respect all 2 Cf Lagardelle Le mouvemnent socialiste No I99 p 426  Arturo Labriola Syndicalisme et socialisme p 17I34 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY hierarchies When a command is given by the powers that be while the first instinct of the German workman is to obey the first instinct of the French workman is to rebel  And if one stops to consider what action involves the superiority of French decisiveness and initiative over German prudence and sluggishness is manifest Reflect too much and one never undertakes anything One must go ahead let himself be borne on by his own impetus trusting only to himself and reflecting that it is not for us to adapt ourselves to the law but for the law to adapt itself to our will  The originality of French syndicalism lies in the fact that its only policy is action1 Between syndicalism and socialism one would expect to find more harmony Both profess to be based on the class struggle both profess to be aiming at the same goal the collective owner ship of industry Yet the syndicalists obstinately decline to accept either the leadership or the cooperation of the socialist party It is a tantalizing situation the hosts of the workers are maLrshaling under socialist banners and marching to a socialist goal all as per programme but they ungratefully refuse to accept the leaders predestined for their guidance or to follow in the paths thought out for their progress Guesde planted and Jaures watered but Pouget and Griffuelhes reap the harvest The syndicalist critic making his attack from the opposite quarter to that from which the revisionist fire is directed charges that orthodox socialism is played out As a doctrine it has become either as in France merely a variant of the prevailing creed of solidarity or as in Germany a meaningless and hair splitting commentary on a few ambiguous odds and ends of phrases let fall by Marx As a movement it has become sluggish colorless correct a bourgeois radicalism of a slightly more advanced type The old fire has gone Responsibility for this parlous condition is placed on its adherence to parliamentary tactics its transformation into a political party15 This transformation has been a steady gradual process A generation ago Jules Guesde declared that it was mere gullibility to expect emancipation from the participation of the proletariat in elections that such action would ineivitably turn to the profit 14 Griffuelhes Syndicalisme et socialisme p 57 15 Arturo Labriola Syndicalismze et socialisme p I IFRENCH UNIONISM MILITANT 135 of its enemy the bourgeoisie6 Then socialists began to enter parliament not to control it but to speak from the windows to the country to use the parliamentary tribune as a pedestal for propaganda The fatal virus of parliamentarism continued to work At the Congress of Lille latterday church council the acceptance of political action was set up as the test of orthodoxy and all the anarchismtinged spirits who rejected this test were cast into the outer darkness of heresy The motion ran as follows The parti ouvrier franqais considers as socialists none but those who relying on the socialist group in the Chamber of Deputies seek the abolition of the capitalist regime by means of the conquest of political power by the proletariat7 Then came the Dreyfus case and the formation of the socialistradicalrepublican bloc in defense of the republic with M Jaures playing Pere Joseph to M Combes Richelieu and the entrance of Comrade Millerand into the WaldeckRousseau cabinet The pace it is true was becoming too fast for some of the old warhorses and this last development brought a split in the party ended only by Jaures repentance and the temporary restoration of the Guesde influence But the faith in parlia mentarism remained unquestioned while right wing and left wing might differ on the minor question of tactics piecemeal or complete capture of power both agreed that the ballot was the socialists best weapon While it was the entrance of Millerand into a bourgeois cabinet sitting cheek by jowl with Gallifet queller of the Com 1nune that first awakened widespread discontent among the militant spirits of the labor exchanges distrust of ministerial participation soon developed into distrust of political action The policy of penetration had made no change in the lot of the work ers had done nothing to develop and train their capacities and fit them for their part in the socialist commonwealth had pro duced no alteration in the character of the state And what was true of the fragmentary conquest of state power by a few 18 Cited in Revue politique II 62 17 Ibid X I64I36 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY socialists the deduction ran was equally true of the complete conquest by the whole socialist party When Augustus had supped it may be that Poland was drunk but whether a few socialists become ministers or all the ministers are socialists the workingmen remain none the less workingmen18 Discontent soon voiced itself in action Without attempting to follow all the battles and skirmishes between the adherents and the opponents of alliance between the socialist party and the syndicalist forces it may suffice to quote the concluding clauses of the resolution of neutrality adopted by the C G T at the Congress of Amiens in I906 and resolutely adhered to since So far as the individual is concerned the Congress affirms that the member of a union is entirely at liberty to participate outside the union in whatever movements correspond to his philosophical or political beliefs limiting itself to ask in return that he should not introduce within the union the opinions he professes beyond its confinies So far as the organi zation is concerned the Congress declares that in order that syndicalism may attain its maximum effect its economic action should be carried on directly against the employer the federated organizations having as labor organizations nothing to do with parties and sects which outside its sphere are entirely at liberty to seek the transformation of society19 The refusal of syndicalism to ally itself with parliamentary socialism is based negatively on its belief in the essentially faulty position of the latter and positively on its belief in its own selfsufficiency The indictment it brings against the social ist party is that it is based on a misconception of the class struggle Party struggle is not class struggle The party is bound together by identity of opinion the class by identity of interests The party is an artificial grouping of men of all classes united by a temporary agreement the class is an organic division of men subjected to the same economic influences living and working on the same plane of material interest This misconception has fatal results on the composition both of the rank and file and of the leaders of the party The rank and file are recruited from every region of discontent the party is committed to the defense of every doomed and decaying fraction of the petty bourgeoisie 18 Lagardelle Le mouvement socialiste No I99 p 429 l9Compterendu du XVe congres rational corporatif p I7IFRENCH UNIONISM MILITANT 137 which is suffering from the onward and inevitable march of indus trial progress its action is clogged and hampered by the necessity ot catering to the largest possible vote The leaders more and more are drawn from the bourgeois intellectuals some led into the socialist ranks by honest conviction some seeking the loaves and fishes seats in parliament or editorship of party organsthe campfollowers whom Marx denounced as lawyers without clients doctors without patients and without learning students of billiards    Whatever their motive be selfsacrificing or selfseeking they are in either case hopelessly out of touch with proletarian thought and life Fatal again to the integrity of socialist doctrine is the changed attitude toward the state which results from parliamentary action Instead of becoming less and less the state becomes more and more it is rashly hoped that a mere change in government personnel will suffice for re demption The attempt is made to realize socialism in the frame work of the existing state And meantime the workers are assigned merely the passive role of casting a ballot once in four years No attempt is made here and now to build up the economic institutions which are to control the society of the future or to train the workers for the new and greater part they are to play20 It is however chiefly the positive belief of syndicalism in its own strength which is the barrier to alliance Syndicalism is no more content to accept the socialist suggestion of syndicalist control of the economic struggle conjoined with socialist control of the political field than the mediaeval papacy was content to accept the Empires compromise of papal supremacy in spiritual and inmperial supremacy in secular affairs For it believes that it can conquer single handed itself achieve the revolution itself build up the economic structures of the future It is the heir of socialism as well as of capitalism With anarchism

anarchists of the policy of burrowing in the unions which led to the antisocialist revolt In their opposition to the state to political action to militarism both movements seem at one But it is claimed by the exponents of syndicalism the resemblances are only superficial the differences fundamental Anarchism is a survival of eighteenthcentury individualism and sentimentalism syndicalism a forerunner of twentiethcentury cooperation and scientific matteroffactness Anarchism makes its appeal to all humanity syndicalism to the proletariat alone Anarchism reactionary at bottom can see no

suppressing industrial outbreaks The new unionism cannot be identified with anarchism any more than with socialisM2 III Syndicalism is not content with negative criticism it has a positive constructive policy to offer It adopts the old warcry of the International The emancipation of the workers must be wrought by the workers themselves and gives it new meaning In every class struggle in the past it is contended the revolu tionary class has created its own organs of emancipation In the battle against feudal privilege the middle class conquered not by penetrating and controlling the distinctively aristocratic institutions but by creating new institutions free towns and parliaments and thus building up the framework of a new bourgeois society while demolishing the old feudal society The proletariat has its distinctive institution ready to its handthe union It is the mission of the Confederation Generale du Travail to aid the workers in forging this new mechanism for its divers purposes building up union federation labor exchange each with its part to play in the society of the future Marx 2 Cf Berth Op cit p 32 Lagardelle Op cit p 43IFRENCH UNIONISM MILITANT I39 himselfwhlom syndicalists delight to quote against the Marxists was the first to recognize that in the struggle for proletariat emancipation the union was to play the part played by the com mune in the struggle for bourgeois emancipation22 The union then has a double part to play In the present the official phrasing runs an organization for collective resistance in the future the unit of production and distribution the basis of social reorganization Or as the organ of the movement phrases it The labor unions are coming to recognize more and more clearly the important part they have to take in the social structure They know that besides defending their daily bread they have to make ready the future They know that the labor organization is the matrix in which the world of tomorrow is being molded24 Details of the structure of the cooming organization are pru dently withheld by the major prophets declining in the classic phrase to draw up kitchen recipes for the saucepans of the future society Such forecasts as have been made notably in response to a questionnaire sent out by the C G T to its con stituent members reveal the extent to which utopianism survives in syndicalist thought25 Meeting the day after the triumph of the general strike the union of each trade is to decide what pro duction is necessary to meet the communitys needs and make an equitable division of the work to be done taking into account the strength and capacity of each workman and leaving him free to produce in accordance with the amount of energy which he can summon26 To the federation is allotted the task of equal izing production and distribution throughout the country with the cooperation of the labor exchange which will further assume what few of the functions of miunicipal bodies are to be preserved The C G T will have charge of international exchanges But what the precise division of functions in the future society 22Cf Lagardelle and Berth op cit Sorel Lavenir socialiste des

the future exist in embryo at present and that here and now beginnings may be made in upbuilding the order that is to be Syndicalism is at one with revisionism in this instalment attitude however widely the means adopted differ in character Action is not postponed till some distant cataclysmal instant According to Pouget The revolution is a work of every moment of today as well as of to morrow it is a continuous movement a daily battle without truce or respite against the forces of oppression and exploitation27 There is none of the passivity of the fatalist belief in the all sufficingness of economic evolution none of the passivity of deputed action Syndicalism with its policy of direct action demands all the courage and confidence and energy the workers can summon and in turn trains them for the tasks they will have to assume in the future Gradually then the various labor oirganizations must take over whatever functions they can snatch from the employer and from the state preparing for the day when they will supersede both entirely Against the state direct action takes the form of external pressure by agitation and demonstration in force as employed in the successful campaign in I9034 for the abolition of registry offices and in I906 for the passing of a weeklyday ofrest law28 Against the employer the means adopted are novel not in themselves but in the revolutionary vigor with which they are applied The strike the main weapon depends for its success not so much on strong strike funds but on the enthusi asm the revolutionary spirit the aggressive vigor of the work ers who recognize the futility of competing with their employers on the pecuniary plane29 Characteristic are two customs which have marked recent French strikes the communist kitchen where cooperative housekeeping is carried on both for econ omys sake and for the stimulus of contact and the cnildrens exodus the dramatic expedient of shipping to syndicalist 27Pouget Le parti du

expedient which has aroused more syndicalist enthusiasm and more bourgeois condemnation This means the use of which was formally rec ommended by the Congress of Toulouse takes the form sometimes of a slowing up in production sometimes of bad workmanship   in retail trade it takes the form of wasting the commodity sold to the customers benefit or the contrary practice of rebuffing the customer to lead him to take his custom elsewhere The fear of sabotage is a precious sedative   An example of its efficacy is afforded by the suc cess of the employees of the Parisian hairdressing establishments in win ning a weekly rest day and shorter hours It was by whitewashing the fronts of the shops with a caustic solution which injured the paint that this union won its better terms In the space of three years out of the two thousand shops in Paris there were scarcely one hundrpd which were not whitewashed at least once if not oftener The nmost spectacular of syndicalist policies is the general strike It is the climax of direct action There is something that fascinates the French workmans dramatic imagination in the picture of the sudden paralysis of industry from end to end of the state by the concerted strike of the whole workingforce of the country This policy discussed sporadically in socialist and anarchist congresses since its first broaching at the Geneva Congress in i866 put into practice of late years by the workmen of Belgium and Sweden and Russia to secure political reforms condemned by many socialist authorities and given a hesitating and qualified adherence by others has become the peculiar posses sion of French syndicalism At first it took the idyllic form of 39H Lagardelle Archiv fur Sozialwissenschaft XXVI 6i i note  Pouget Op cit p 4I v cf Jules Guesde The boycott

worth while quoting the official prophecy of its work ing The cessation of work which would place the country in the rigor of death would necessarily be of short duration its terrible and incalculable consequences would force the government to capitulate at once If it refused the proletariat in revolt from one end of France to the other would be able to compel it for the military forces scattered and isolated over the whole territory would be unable to act in concert and could not oppose the slightest resistance to the will of the workers at last masters of the situation33 A necessary complement to the policy of the general strike is the antimilitarism propaganda This opposition to militarism has its origin not so much in humanitarian longings for peace between nations as in the fear of the use of the army in the partial strikes of today and the general strike of tomorrow Bound up with it there is an attitude of hostility to the statethe doomed rival of syndicalist organizationsand scornful rejection of the ideals of patriotism An essential feature of the syndicalist creed is the hostility to majority rule Syndicalism possesses the happy faculty of mak ing

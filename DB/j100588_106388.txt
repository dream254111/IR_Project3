J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106388,THE PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES OF THE ENGINE FOR TURNING OVALS IN WOOD OR METAL AND OF THE INSTRUMENT FOR DRAWING OVALS UPON PAPER DEMONSTRATED BY THE REV MR LUDLAM VICAR OF NORTON NEAR LEICESTER COMMUNICATED BY THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL,I206935,378 XXIV THE PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES OF THE ENGINE FOR TURNING OVALS IN WOOD OR METAL AND OF THE INSTRUMENT FOR DRAWING OVALS UPON PAPER DEMONSTRATED BY THE REV MR LUDLAM VICAR OF NORTON NEAR LEICESTER COM MUNICATED BY THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL READ MAY 4 1780 T H E INSTRUMENT FOR DRAWING OVALS UPON PAPER OR BOARD IS SO COMMON THAT A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF IT IS NEEDLESS IT IS MUCH IN USE AMONG THE JOINERS AND CALLED BY THEM THE TRAMMELS ONE PART OF IT CONSISTS OF A CROSS WITH TWO GROOVES AT RIGHT ANGLES THE OTHER IS A BEAM CARRYING TWO PINS WHICH SLIDE IN THOSE GROOVES AND ALSO THE DESCRIBING PENCIL WE SHALL DISTINGUISH THESE TWO PARTS BY THE NAMES OF THE CROSS AND THE BEAM IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN THAT ALL THE ENGINES FOR TURNING OVALS ARE CONSTRUCTED ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES WITH THE TRAMMELS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN THE TRAMMELS THE BOARD IS AT REST AND THE PENCIL MOVES UPON IT IN THE TURNING ENGINE THE TOOL WHICH SUPPLIES THE PLACE OF THE PENCIL IS AT REST AND THE BOARD MOVES AGAINST IT LETMR LUDLAM ON THE ENGINE FOR TURNING OVALS 379 LET A A AND B B FIG 1 BE TWO INDEFINITE LINES INTER SECTING EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES IN C LET LSM BE THE BEAM OR A RIGID RIGHT LINE IN WHICH ASSUME TWO FIXED POINTS L AND S AT PLEASURE IF THE FIXED POINT L BE KEPT ALWAYS SLIDING UPON THE LINE BCB AND THE OTHER POINT S ALWAYS SLIDING UPON THE LINE ACA I SAY THEN THAT ANY POINT M IN THE LINE LS OR THAT LINE PRODUCED WILL DESCRIBE AN ELLIPSE BISECT LS IN E AND THROUGH C AND E DRAW THE INDEFI NITE RIGHT LINE CEH UPON LS AS A DIAMETER WITH THE CENTER E DESCRIBE A SEMICIRCLE AND BECAUSE LCS IS A RIGHT ANGLE IT WILL PASS THROUGH C AND EC  EL THROUGH M DRAW MPH PERPENDICULAR TO AC

INVARIABLE ON MEK TAKE EV  EK AND EACH  ES OR EL I SAY THE POINT V WILL DESCRIBE A RIGHT LINE AVC PASSING THROUGH C AND MAKING AN ANGLE ACS WITH CA EQUAL TO HALF MEM THE ANGLE MADE BY THE TWO RULERS THE POINT K WILL ALSO DESCRIBE A RIGHT LINE HKC PASSING THROUGH C AND MAKING AN ANGLE HCL WITH CL ALSO EQUAL TO HALF MEM ON THE CENTER E FIG 2 AND 3 AND WITH THE RADIUS EC DESCRIBE A CIRCLE AND IT WILL PASS THROUGH THE POINTS S V C L K DRAW THE LINES VC AND KC AND THE ANGLES SEV AND SCV BOTH STAND ON THE SAME ARCH SV THE FOR MER AT THE CENTER E THE LATTER AT THE CIRCUMFERENCE C THEREFORE THE FORMER IS DOUBLE THE LATTER IN LIKE MANNER THE ANGLES KEL AND KCL BOTH STAND ON THE SAME ARCH KL 1 THEFOR TURNING OVALS 381 THE FORMER AT THE CENTER THE LATTER AT THE CIRCUMFERENCE THEREFORE THE FORMER IS DOUBLE THE LATTER NOW AS THIS HOLDS IN EVERY POSITION OF THE RULERS DURING THEIR JOINT MOTION IT IS MANIFEST THE POINTS V AND K WILL EACH DE SCRIBE RIGHT LINES NAMELY AC AND BC PASSING THROUGH C AND MAKING THE ANGLES ACA AND BCL BC EACH EQUAL TO HALF MEM HENCE THE LINES AC AND BC TRACED BY THE POINTS V AND K ARE AT RIGHT ANGLES AND THE RULER MVEK MOVES EXACTLY IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF IT WAS GUIDED BY THE THE POINTS V AND K SLIDING ON THE LINES AC AND BC AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER JUST IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE RULER MSL IS GUIDED BY THE POINTS S AND L SLIDING ON THE LINES AC AND BC THEREFORE IF ANY POINT M BE ASSUMED IN THE LINE KVM AS A DESCRIBING POINT THE FIGURE DESCRIBED WILL BE AN ELLIPSE THE POSITION OF WHOSE PRINCI PAL AXES ARE THE LINES AC AND BC THE CENTER OF THE ELLIPSE BEING STILL IN C AS BEFORE IF MK IS TAKEN EQUAL TO ML THE ELLIPSE THUS DESCRIBED BY THE POINT M WILL BE THE SAME WITH THAT DESCRIBED BY THE POINT M ONLY IN ANOTHER POSITION ITS GREATER SEMIAXIS AC MAKING AN ANGLE WITH AC THE GREATER SEMIAXIS OF THE FORMER ELLIPSE EQUAL TO HALF MEM THE ANGLE WHICH THE RULERS OR LINES ME AND ME MAKE WITH EACH OTHER E E E 2 SCHOLIUM382 MR LUDLAM ON THE ENGINE SCHOLIUM THIS PROPOSITION IS DEMONSTRATED IN SCHOO TENS EXERCITATIONES C P 305 BUT HE MAKES TWELVE CASES OF IT HAD HE MADE USE OF THE 20TH OF THE 3D EL THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALL COMPREHENDED UNDER ONE IN THE TURNING OF OVALS THE TOP OF THE REST WHICH SUP PORTS THE TOOL IS ALWAYS MADE TO PASS THROUGH S AND L FIG 1 THE TWO CENTERS ROUND WHICH THE OVAL ENGINE TURNS AND IN THIS CASE THE RULER OR LINE MSEL REPRESENTS THE TOP OF THE REST IF THE TOOL BE HELD ON ANY PART OF THE REST BETWEEN THE WORKMAN AND THE NEAREST CENTER AS AT M AN OVAL WILL BE TURNED HAVING ITS LONGER AXIS AA IN ONE POSITION OF THE WORK COINCIDING WITH THE TOP OF THE REST AS THE TOOL IS REMOVED TOWARDS S THE OVAL WILL GROW NARROWER AND AT S BECOME A RIGHT LINE BEYOND S TOWARDS E IT WILL GROW ROUNDER AND AT E BECOME A CIRCLE BEYOND E IT WILL GROW NARROWER AND AT L BECOME A RIGHT LINE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE RIGHT LINE DESCRIBED WHEN THE TOOL WAS AT S IF THE TOOL BE REMOVED BEYOND L IT WILL DESCRIBE AN OVAL AGAIN WHOSE LONGER AXIS IS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE LONGER AXIS OF THE OVAL FIRST DESCRIBED WHEN THE TOOL WAS AT M IT MAY BE VERY CONVENIENT TO MARK THE POINTS S AND L AND ALSO THEIR MIDDLE POINT E ON THE TOP OR FACE OF THE REST THAT SUPPORTS THE TOOL IF ANY THING BE INTER POSED BETWEEN THE TOOL AND THE TOP OF THE REST SO AS TO RAISE THE TOOL ABOVE THE LINE PASSING THROUGH THE CENTERS S ANDFOR TURNING OVALS 383 S AND L AN OVAL WILL YET BE DESCRIBED WHOSE CENTER WILL BE THE SAME WITH THAT OF THE OVAL FIRST DESCRIBED WHEN THE TOOL WAS AT M BUT ITS PRINCIPAL AXIS WILL CROSS THE PRINCIPAL AXIS OF THAT OVAL FIG 2 AND 3 DRAW RIGHT LINES BOTH FROM M THE OLD PLACE OF THE TOOL AND FROM M THE NEW PLACE OF THE TOOL TO THE POINT E MARKED ON THE REST HALF THE ANGLE WHICH THESE TWO LINES MAKE WITH EACH OTHER WILL BE THE ANGLE WHICH THE PRINCIPAL AXIS OF THE NEW OVAL MAKES WITH THE PRINCIPAL AXIS OF THE OLD ONE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT WHEN THE OVAL ENGINE IS SET IN ORDER FOR WORKING THERE IS A PART WHICH SLIDES BACK AND IS THEN FIXED WHICH SEPARATES THE TWO CENTERS OF MOTION AND GIVES THE ECCENTRICITY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND SEMIAXES WILL BE JUST AS MUCH AS THE CEN TERS ARE THUS SEPARATED CALL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO CENTERS E LET NOW THE TOOL BE FIXED IN ANY PLACE UPON ABOVE OR BELOW THE REST CALL ME THE DISTANCE OF THE TOOL FROM THE MIDDLE POINT BETWEEN THE CENTERS MARKED E ON THE REST D AND THE GREATER SEMIAXIS OF THE OVAL SO DE SCRIBED WILL BE D  12E AND THE LESSER SEMIAXIS D  12E AND THUS BOTH THE FORM AND POSITION OF THE OVAL WILL BE KNOWN ALL WORKMEN KNOW THE TOOL MUST NEVER BE RAISED ABOVE THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS AT FIRST HELD AND WE 7 SEE384 MR LUDLAM ON THE ENGINE SEE THE REASON IT WOULD DESTROY THE OVAL FIRST BEGUN TO BE TURNED AND FORM A NEW ONE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION BUT THERE IS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OVALS ESPE CIALLY SUCH AS HAVE MOULDINGS AS PICTUREFRAMES C THE TOOL GENERALLY HAS ALL THE MOULDINGS FORMED UPON IT NOW IF IT BE LAID FLAT UPON THE REST AND THE ENGINE SET TO WORK THE MOULDINGS WILL IN SOME PLACES CROSS THE PLANE OF THE TOOL OR THE TOP OF THE REST AT RIGHT ANGLES AS IN TURNING CIRCLES IN OTHER PLACES OBLIQUELY THIS WILL MAKE THE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE MOULDINGS LEANER OR SMALLER IN ONE PART OF THE WORK THAN ANOTHER NOR WILL THE CASE BE ALTERED IF THE MOULDINGS BE TURNED SEPA RATELY ANALOGOUS TO THIS WHEN AN OVAL IS DRAWN BY THE TRAMMELS THE LINE DESCRIBED BY THE PENCIL WILL NOT AS IN A CIRCLE BE ALWAYS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE BEAM OF THE TRAMMELS THE OVAL LINE SO DRAWN WILL BE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE DESCRIBING BEAM ONLY AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE TWO PRINCIPAL AXES WHERE THE BEAM COINCIDES WITH THOSE AXES IN ALL OTHER PLACES THE OVAL LINE AND BEAM MAKE AN OBLIQUE ANGLE IT MAY BE PROPER THEREFORE TO ENQUIRE HOW MUCH THIS ANGLE DEVIATES FROM A RIGHT ANGLE THIS WE SHALL CALL THE ANGLE OF DEVIATION ALL THINGS AS IN FIG 1 DRAW THE TANGENTS TM AND TN TO THE POINT M IN THE ELLIPSE AND THE POINT N IN THE CIRCLE CORRESPONDING TO EACH OTHER AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE ELLIPSEFOR TURNING OVALS 385 ELLIPSE THESE TANGENTS WILL MEET EACH OTHER IN THE AXIS CA PRODUCED DRAW MG PERPENDICULAR TO TM AND GMS WILL BE THE ANGLE OF DEVIATION SOUGHT I SAY THE ANGLE MTN BETWEEN THE TANGENTS TO CORRESPONDING POINTS IN THE ELLIPSE AND CIRCUMSCRIBING CIRCLE IS EQUAL TO THE ANGLE OF DEVIATION GMS FOR BECAUSE TNC IS A RIGHTANGLED TRIANGLE AND NP PERPENDICULAR TO TC THEREFORE TNP  NCP  MSP THAT IS IN THE TRIANGLES MTN AND GMS THE ANGLES TNM AND MSG ARE EQUAL IN LIKE MANNER BECAUSE TMG IS A

injury thereto under any practical conditions Eclipse blindness the only thermic effect on the retina of common occurrence clinically is due to the action of the concentrated heat on the pigment epithelium and chorioid this heat being almost wholly due to radiations of the visible spectrum within which the maximum solar energy lies The abiotic energy in the solar spectrum is a meager remnant between wavelengths 295 jiM and 305 M aggregating hardly a quarter of one per cent of the total At high altitudes and in clear air it is sufficient to produce slight abiotic effects such as are noted in snow blindness and solar erythema the former only occurring with long exposures under very favorable circumstances and the latter being in ordinary cases complicated by an erythema due to heat alone The amount of abiotic energy required to produce a specific effect in solar erythema is substantially the same as that required for mild photophthalmia Erythropsia is not in any way connected with the exposure of the eye to ultraviolet radiations but is merely a special case of color fatigue temporary and without pathological significance Vernal catarrh and senile cataract we can find no evidence for considering as due to radiations of any kind Glass blowers cataract often charged to specific radiation ultraviolet or other we regard as probably due to the overheating of the eye as a whole with consequent disturbed nutrition of the lens Commercial illuminants we find to be en tirely free of danger under the ordinary condi tions of their use The abiotic radiations furnished by even the most powerful of them are too small in amount to produce danger of photophthalmia under ordinary working con ditions even when accidentally used without their globes The glass enclosing globes used with all practical commercial illuminants are amply sufficient to reduce any abiotic radia tions very far below the danger point Under ordinary conditions no glasses of any kind are required as protection against abiotic radiations The chief usefulness of protec tive glasses lies not so much in their absorption of any specific radiations as in their reducing the total amount of light to a point where it ceases to be psychologically disagreeable or to be inconveniently dazzling Glasses which cut off both ends of the spectrum and transmit chiefly only rays of relatively high luminosity give the maximum visibility with the minimum reception of energy For protection against abiotic action in experimentation or in the snow fields ordinary colored glasses are quite sufficient So far as direct destruction of bacteria within the cornea or any other tissues of the body is concerned abiotic radiations possess no therapeutic value This is due to the fact that abiotic radiations that are able to pene trate ithe tissues are more destructive to the latter than to bacteria F I VERHOEFF Louis BELL SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY BY invitation of Brown University the twenty first summer meeting of the society was held at that institution on Tuesday and Wednesday Sep tember 89 in connection with the celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the university Two sessions were held on Tuesday and a morning session on Wednes day the attendance including fiftytwo members President Van Vleck occupied the chair at the morning sessions being relieved by Vicepresident L P Eisenhart at the Tuesday afternoon session New members were elected as follows Mr L K Adkins University of Minnesota Dr Lennie P Copeland Wellesley College Mr J W Cromwell Jr Washington D C High Schools Professor Tsuruichi Hayashi T6hoku Imperial University Sendai Japan Professor C I Palmer Armour In stitute of Technology Mr G A Pfeiffer Columbia University Mr P B Rider Yale University Dr Alfred Iosenblatt University of Cracow Miss Caroline E Seely Columbia University Eleven applications for membership were received It was decided to hold the annual meeting about January 1 the exact date to be so fixed that those who wish SCIENCE 455N S ToL XL No 1030 may attend the winter meeting of the Chicago Section and the meeting of Section A of the Amer ican Association as well as the annual meeting At the latter meeting which will be held in New York President Van Vieck will deliver his presi dential address A committee was appointed to arrange for hold ing the summer meeting of 1915 at San Francisco It was decided to issue only the List of Officers and Members next year in place of the usual Annual Register The authorities of Brown University extended a lavish hospitality to the society The morning ses sion on Tuesday opened with an address of wel come by Chancellor A B Chace Professor N F Davis entertained the members and ladies at tea in the John Carter Brown Library on Tuesday after noon and at luncheon in Rockefeller Hall on Wednesday The university gave a dinner in honor of the society at the University Club on Tuesday evening the occasion concluding with a cordial ad dress by President Faunce and an interesting ac count by Professor Carl Barus of the IHistorical development of the modern theory of physics I

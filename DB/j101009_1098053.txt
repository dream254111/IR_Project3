J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1098053,THE EXTENSION OF LOANS SECURED BY DEED OF TRUST,I245855,EXTENSION OF LOANS BEEN SUGGESTED BY PREVIOUS WRITERS IN THE REGISTER ON THE SUBJECT IN HAND THESE HARDSHIPS GROW OUT OF GIVING COLOR OF TITLE AND CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION TO THE WRONGFUL CLAIMANT WE HAVE SEEN WHAT IS BELIEVED TO BE THE COMMON LAW ORIGIN OF THIS AND THE COMMON LAW REASONS THERE FOR AND HOW FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN OUR JURISPRUDENCE IS THIS RULESO FIRMLY EMBEDDED INDEED THAT NOTHING SHORT OF LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENT CAN REMOVE IT AT THE SAME TIME IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE COM MON LAW REASONS FOR THIS RULE HAVE IN A GREAT DEGREE IF NOT ENTIRELY BEEN REMOVED IN MODERN TIMES INDEED THIS COMMON LAW RULE MAY BE SAID TO BE ANTAGONISTIC TO THE POLICY OF OUR LAW OF THE PRESENT DAY AS EXEMPLIFIED IN OUR REGISTRY SYSTEM APPLICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE ENACTMENT OF A STATUTE ABOLISH ING THE RULE AS TO COLOR OF TITLE AND TAKING AWAY ITS BENEFITS FROM WRONGFUL CLAIMANTS SO THAT OUR RECORDS WILL SHOW THE EXACT CONDITION OF THE TITLE OF EACH LANDOWNER EXCEPT WHERE THE AND IS IN THE PEDIS POSITIO OR TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS IN THE PEDIS POITIO OF AN ADVERSE CLAIMANT IS BELIEVED TO BE THE TRUE REMEDY FOR THE HARDSHIPS COMPLAINED OF F W SIMS LOUISA VA THE IXTNIINSION OF LOANS SECURED BY DEED OF TRUST THE FOLLOWING REFLECTIONS UPON THE SUBJECT OF THE EXTENSION OF LOANS SECURED BY DEED OF TRUST GROW OUT OF A CASE MET WITH IN ORDINARY PRACTI E ALTHOUGH INTENDED TO COVER IN A GENERAL MANNER THE SUBJECT TREATED THERE WILL BE NO ATTEMPT AT EXHAUSTIVE TREATMENT BUT SIMPLY A DISCUS SION OF SUCH POINTS AS AROSE IN THE CASE REFERRED TO WHICH ARE BELIEVED TO BE OF INTEREST THE FOLLOWING FACTS ARE ASSUMED AS ATTENDING UPON ANY CASE LIKELY TO ARISE WHICH WILL INVOLVE THE POINTS HERE DISCUSSED TOWIT A LOAN OF A FIXED SUM SAY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A STATED PERIOD SAY THREE YEARS A DEED OF TRUST TO SECURE THE NOTES WHICH REPRESENT THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF SAID LOAN AUTHORIZING THE TRUSTEE TO SELL IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BEING MADE IN THE PAYMENT OF ANY OF THE NOTES SECURED IN THE DEED AND FINALLY AN AGREEMENT TO EXTEND THE LOAN FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF THREE YEARS ENTERED INTO PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTE 1899 571VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER WE SUPPOSE THAT THE ORIGINAL NOTES REPRESENTING INTEREST WHICH FELL DUE THOUGH NOT EO NOMINE EVERY SIX MONTHS WERE PAID AT MATURITY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO THE DISCUSSION TO SUPPOSE THAT A NEW SET OF INTEREST NOTES WERE SIGNED AND DELIVERED WHEN THE LOAN WAS EXTENDED BUT SINCE THAT WAS TRUE IN THE ACTUAL CASE LET US SUPPOSE THAT IT WAS DONE HERE ALSO UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DEFAULT IS MADE IN THE PAYMENT OF ONE OF THE INSTALLMENTS OF INTEREST SAY IN THE THIRD OF THE NEW INTEREST NOTES AND THE QUESTION IS AS TO THE REMEDY NATURALLY WE TURN TO THE CONTRACT FOR EXTENSION TO FIND WHAT ITS PROVISIONS ARE AND THUS DEVELOP THE FIRST POINT OF THE CASE THAT CONTRACT MADE NO SPECIAL PROVISION FOR AND CONTAINED NO REFERENCE TO A POSSIBLE DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST THE CONTRACT WAS IN FACT BY PAROL AND AMOUNTED TO NOTHING MORE THAN AN AGREEEMENT TO EXTEND THE LOAN FOR THREE YEARS UPON NEW INTEREST NOTES BEING GIVEN FALLING DUE EVERY SIX MONTHS AS BEFORE WITHOUT ANY NEW STIPULATIONS OR CONDITIONS TO MEET THE CHANGED STATUS OF THE LOAN IT BEING COMPETENT TO THE PARTIES TO CONTRACT FOR AN EXTENSION IT WAS OF COURSE ALSO COMPETENT TO THEM TO PROVIDE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THAT EXTENSION WAS TO BE MADE AND THE REMEDIES IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH SUCH TERMS BUT DEFAULT HAVING BEEN MADE IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND THE CONTRACT FOR EXTENSION OFFERING NO REMEDY THE CREDITOR MUST TURN TO THE DEED OF TRUST TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL EFFECT OF HIS CONTRACT FOR EXTENSION UPON ITS TERMS AND PROVISIONS AND FIND HIS REMEDY THERE IF HE IS TO HAVE A REMEDY AT ALL CONSIDERING THEN THE NATURE AND EFFECT OF SUCH A CONTRACT WE FIND IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT TO EXTEND MEANS TO PROLONG TO PRO TRACT  TO CONTINUE AS TIME TO LENGTHEN AS TO EXTEND THE TIME OF PAYMENT SEE WEBSTER TO EXTEND A LOAN THEREFORE MEANS TO EXTEND THE TIME OF PAYMENT OF THE LOAN AND NOTHING MORE IT CANNOT MEAN TO MAKE A NEW CONTRACT OR A NEW LOAN IT EXTENDS OR LENGTHENS THE TIME OF PAYMENT OF THE OLD LOAN THE TERMS OF WHICH REMAIN UN CHANGED IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS SO FAR AS CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW CIRCUM STANCES AND WITH THE CONTRACT FOR EXTENSION NO NEW NOTE IS GIVEN FOR THE PRINCIPAL FOR THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A  RENEWAL AND NOT AN  EX TENSION THE EVIDENCE OF DEBT AND THE SECURITY REMAIN THE SAME EXCEPT THAT THE RIGHT TO DEMAND PAYMENT AND TO FORECLOSE IN CASE OF DEFAULT IS SUSPENDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE CONTRACT IN THE SECOND PLACE WE FIND THAT THE EXTENSION OF THE TIME OF PAYMENT SUPPOSING OF COURSE THAT THE CONTRACT IS VALID AND 572 JANEXTENSION OF LOANS BINDING IN OTHER RESPECTS HAS THE EFFECT IN EQUITY OF MODIFYING THE ORIGINAL CONDITION OF THE MORTGAGE TO THE SAME EXTENT AS IF THE TERMS OF THE NEW AGREEMENT WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE CONDITION 2 JONES ON MORTGAGES 4TH ED SEC 1190 IT IS POSSIBLE OF COURSE THAT THE DEED MAY PROVIDE FOR FORECLOSURI IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF ANY INSTALLMENT OF INTERESTI EO NOMINE AND MAY SET OUT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE IN SUCH A CONTINGENCY AND IT IS SUPPOSED THAT THE TERMS MAY BE BROAD ENOUGH TO AUTHORIZE A SALE NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE INSTALLMENT OF IN TEREST DEFAULTED IN IS ONE OF THE NEW INSTALLMENTS ACCRUING UNDER THE LOAN AS EXTENDED OR ONE OF THE NEW INTEREST NOTES IF SUCH NOTES WERE GIVEN IN SUCH A CASE NO DIFFICULTY WOULD ARISE EXCEPT AS REGARDS THE EQUITIES OF JUNIOR LIENORS WHO EVEN IF THEY COULD NOT INSIST THAT THE NEW INTEREST WAS NOT SECURED UNDER THE DEED MIGHT AT LEAST CONTEND THAT IT WAS POSTPONED TO THEIR LIENS THIS QUESTION CANNOT BE DISCUSSED HERE ALTHOUGH IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE MOST THAT COULD BE CLAIMED FOR SUCH JUNIOR LIENS WOULD BE THAT THEY WERE PREFERRED TO THE NEW INTEREST BUT SUCH A CASE AS THE ONE SUP POSED IS NOT LIKELY TO OCCUR IT IS FAR MORE PROBABLE THAT REFERENCE TO THE DEED OF TRUST WOULD DISCOVER THE FACT THAT IT WAS TO SECURE CERTAIN PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED NOTES OF GIVEN DATES AND AMOUNTS THERE AS IN THE CASE SUGGESTING THIS INVESTIGATION THE TRUSTEE WOULD BE EMPOWERED TO SELL NOT IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF ANY INSTALLMENT OF INTEREST BUT IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF EITHER OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED OR ABOVE DESCRIBED NOTES THE NEW INTEREST NOTE UPON WHICH DEFAULT ACTUALLY WAS MADE WOULD LIKELY ENOUGH CORRESPOND IN AMOUNT WITH SOME OF THE ABOVE MEN TIONED NOTES BUT IT WOULD DIFFER AS TO DATE AND PERHAPS IN OTHER RE SPECTS ALSO IT WOULD NOT IN FACT BE ONE OF THEM HOW THEN COULD THE TRUSTEE SELL  THE DEFAULT PROVIDED FOR IN THE DEED MUST HAPPEN BEFORE A SALE CAN BE HAD 2 JONES ON MORT 4TH ED 1174 IT WOULD SEEM CLEAR THAT THE TRUSTEE MAY BE ENJOINED IN SUCH A CASE FROM SELLING FOR THE INTEREST NOTE OR BECAUSE OF THE DEFAULT IN THE IN TEREST INSTALLMENT UNLESS OTHER AUTHORITY FOR IT CAN BE SUGGESTED THE TRUSTEE DERIVES HIS POWER AND AUTHORITY WHOLLY FROM THE DEED AND HE CANNOT WAIVE ANY OF ITS REQUIREMENTS OR CONDITIONS NOR CAN HE ALTER ATS TERMS A DEED OF TRUST IS IN LAW TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES NOTH ING MORE THAN A MORTGAGE WITH A POWER OF SALE WHICH POWER MUST NOT 1899 573VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ONLY BE EXPRESSLY CONFERRED BUT JNUST ALSO BE EXECUTED IN THE MANNER PRESCRIBED 28 AM  ENG ENCY L 221 AND 226 NOR WOULD RECOURSE TO THE COURTS BE OF ASSISTANCE FOR ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT A POWER OF SALE CLAUSE DOES NOT OUST THE COURT OF ITS JURISDICTION IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE COURT IS ITSELF STRICTLY BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THE DEED 2 JONES ON MORT 1174 8 AM  ENG ENCY L 277278 CRENSHAW V SEIGFRIED 24 GRATT 272 IN CONFORMITY WITH THE FOREGOING IT IS INSISTED AS BEING ALSO LAW THAT IF A MORTGAGE CONTAINS NO PROVISION FOR FORECLOSURE UPON THE NON PAYMENT OF INTEREST EVEN THOUGH GIVEN FOR THE SECURITY OF THE PAY MENT OF A NOTE WITH INTEREST A FORECLOSURE CANNOT BE HAD UNTIL THE PRINCIPAL SUM BECOMES DUE 8 AM  ENG ENCY L 189 NOTE 1 BRODRIBB V TIBBETS 58 CAL 6 AND NALTNER V TAPPEY 55 IND 111 IT WOULD THEREFORE FOLLOW IN THE CASE OF A LOAN SECURED BY DEED OF TRUST BEING EXTENDED FOR THREE YEARS WITHOUT A PROVISION FOR FORE CLOSURE UPON DEFAULT IN THE INSTALLMENTS OF INTEREST TO ACCRUE DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD BEING CONTAINED EITHER IN THE AGREEMENT FOR EX TENSION OR IN THE ORIGINAL DEED THAT NO FORECLOSURE COULD BE HAD UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD NOTWITHSTANDING CONTINUED AND REPEATED DEFAULT IN INTEREST THIS IS SO SERIOUS A RESULT AS TO INDUCE EARNEST EFFORT TO FIND SOME ESCAPE FROM THE CONCLUSION WE DO NOT BELIEVE HOWEVER THERE IS ANY OTHER CONCLUSION THAT CAN PROPERLY BE ARRIVED AT WE BELIEVE IT TO BE WELL SETTLED THAT THE TIME OF PAYMENT OF A SEALED CONTRACT MAY BE EXTENDED BY PAROL AGREEMENT 2 JONES ON MORTGAGES 1179 1190 AND 1191 8 AM  ENG ENCY L 190 NOTE 1 SAXTON 280 AND 53 VERMONT 92 MANY AUTHORITIES DECLARE THAT A GOOD CONSIDERATION IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SUCH A CONTRACT BINDING BUT IT IS NOT BELIEVED THAT A NEW CON SIDERATION WOULD BE NECESSARY BURT V SAXTON 1 HUN N Y 551 IT MUST BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THE CONTRACT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DEFINITE AGREEMENT TO EXTEND THE LOAN FOR A STATED PERIOD AS DISTIN GUISHED FROM A MERE VAGUE AND INDEFINITE FORBEARANCE THE LATTER MIGHT BE AND INDEED HAS BEEN SET ASIDE BUT THE FORMER SUPPOSED TO BE A BINDING CONTRACT MUST BE ENFORCED IN CASE OF SUCH DEFAULT THE CREDITOR MIGHT SUE UPON HIS INTEREST NOTE OR FOR THE INTEREST AND HAVING REDUCED HIS CLAIM TO JUDGMENT NO REASON IS PERCEIVED WHY HE MIGHT NOT GET HIS MONEY BY EXECUTION IF THAT BE POSSIBLE BUT IT IS NOT SUPPOSED THAT A DEBTOR OUT OF WHOM MONEY MAY BE MADE BY EXECUTION WILL USUALLY PERMIT THE INTEREST TO 574 JANBE DEFAULTED UPON AND THIS REMEDY IS SUPPOSED TO BE MORE NOMINAL THAN REAL AS HAS BEEN SAID THE DEED MAY HAVE PROVIDED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FOR A FORFEITURE OF THE PRINCIPAL UPON DEFAULT IN THE INTEREST BUT IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT IT WILL CONTAIN APPROPRIATE PROVISIONS INDEED ITS PROVISIONS MAY BE TO A CONTRARY EFFECT AS IN THE CASE NOW BEING CON SIDERED THERE THE DEED PROVIDES THAT IF ANY OF THE SAID NOTES SHALL NOT HAVE BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE  WHEN DEFAULT OCCURRED  SUCH PART OR PARTS OF THE SAID PURCHASE MONEY AS WILL BE SUFFICIENT SHALL BE MADE PAYABLE AT SUCH TIME OR TIMES AS THE SAID REMAINING NOTES WILL BECOME DUE IT IS SCARCELY NECESSARY TO REMARK THAT SUCH A CONTRACT FORBIDDING THE CALLING IN OF THE PRINCIPAL UPON DEFAULT IN THE INTEREST MAY BE MADE BY COMPETENT PARTIES AND MUST BE OBSERVED 2 JONES ON MORTGAGES 1178 ON THE OTHER HAND WE BELIEVE IT TO BE SOUND LAW THAT IN THE AB SENCE OF A CLAUSE MAKING THE WHOLE DEBT DUE ON BREACH OF A CONDITION THE MORTGAGE CANNOT BE FORECLOSED FOR THE WHOLE AMOUNT 8 AM  ENG ENCY L 192 NOTE FAILURE TO PAY INTEREST 2 B MON 202 AND FURTHERMORE WE INSIST THAT ALTHOUGH THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST IS A CONDITION WHICH THE DEBTOR MUST PERFORM ITS NONPAYMENT IS NOT SUCH A BREACH OF THE CONDITION AS MAKES THE WHOLE PRINCIPAL DUE BURT V SAXTON 1 HUN N Y 551 IT IS TRUE THAT MANY DECISIONS TO A CONTRARY EFFECT MAY BE FOUND THOUGH HAPPILY WE BELIEVE THERE ARE NONE IN VIRGINIA WE SAY HAPPILY THERE ARE NONE IN VIRGINIA BECAUSE WE THINK SUCH DECISIONS ARE UNSOUND AND ILLCONSIDERED THEY ARE FOUNDED IN OUR OPINION UPON A MISCONCEPTION AND ARE NO DOUBT LARGELY DUE TO EFFORTS UPON PART OF THE COURTS TO AVOID WHAT MAY APPEAR TO BE A HARDSHIP IN FACT HOWEVER THERE IS NO HARDSHIP IN THE CASE IT IS A SIMPLE QUESTION OF CONTRACT AND IF PARTIES ARE CARELESS ENOUGH TO MAKE CON TRACTS WHICH FAIL TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS PROPERLY IT IS CERTAINLY NO BUSINESS OF A COURT TO MAKE NEW CONTRACTS BY CONSTRUCTION FOR THEM THESE DECISIONS PROCEED UPON THE IDEA THAT THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST IS THE CONDITION UPON WHICH THE LOAN IS FOUNDED AND THAT THIS CONDI TION NOT BEING PERFORMED THE CONTRACT MAY BE DECLARED AT AN END BY THE CREDITOR AND A SALE HAD FOR THE PRINCIPAL IRRESPECTIVE OR AT LEAST INDEPENDENT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE DEED OR CONTRACT SUCH DECISIONS ARE SAID TO RELY AND ARE SUPPOSED TO RELY UPON A DICTUM OF CHANCELLOR SUGDEN THIS DICTUM IS THUS STATED BY JONES IN HIS TREATISE ON 1899 575 EXTENSION OF LOANSVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MORTGAGES IN SECTION 1177 DEFAULT IN HALFYEARLY INTEREST AT THE TIMES STIPULATED IS HELD BY HIGH AUTHORITY TO GIVE A RIGHT TO FORECLOSE IMMEDIATELY THOUGH THE PRINCIPAL SUM IS NOT DUE AND THERE IS NO PRO VISION MAKING A FORFEITURE OF THE PRINCIPAL UPON A DEFAULT IN THE IN TEREST NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF CHANCELLOR SUGDENS NAME WHICH IS GIVEN TO THIS DOCTRINE JONES HIMSELF SEEMS TO REPUDIATE IT AFTER DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT AT LENGTH BY SAYING IN SECTION 1179  THE GENERAL RULE HOWEVER IS THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY AGREEMENT THAT THE WHOLE DEBT SHALL BE DUE UPON FAILURE TO PAY ANY INSTALLMENT OF IT THE MORTGAGE CANNOT BE FORECLOSED IN EQUITY UNTIL THE LAST INSTALLMENT HAS BECOME DUE HARSHAW V AMCKESSON 66 N C 266 THE DOCTRINE SEEMS TO US TO BE UNSOUND BECAUSE IT IS OPPOSED TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE LAW RELATING TO THE GENERAL SUBJECT A MORTGAGE IS A MORTGAGE NOTWITHSTANDING IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A POWER OF SALE INDEED ITS OBJECT IS MERELY SECURITY FOR THE DEBT ORIGINALLY IT DID NOT CONTAIN THE POWER OF SAID CLAUSE WHICH IS NOT AN INHERENT PART OF A MORTGAGE BUT IS A SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OR ADDITION THE RESULT OF A DEFAULT IN THE DEBT SECURED WAS NOT A SALE BUT WAS THE PASSING OF THE PROPERTY IN THE COURSE OF TIME THE POWER OF SALE CLAUSE WAS ADDED TO THE MORTGAGE AND THEN CAME THE INTERPOSITION OF THE DISINTERESTED TRUSTEE WHO CONDUCTED THE SALE THE POWER TO SELL THEREFORE MUST ALWAYS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSLY GIVEN AND STRICTLY EXECUTED IN THE MANNER PRESCRIBED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO AGREE THEN TO A DOCTRINE WHICH PERMITS SUCH A POWER TO BE IMPLIED 27 AM  ENG ENCY L 221 226 TO PERMIT A TRUSTEE TO SELL WHEN THE DEED DOES NOT CONTAIN A POWER OF SALE IS TO IMPLY THAT POWER AND TO PERMIT HIM TO SELL FOR THE PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IN A CONTINGENCY DIFFERENT FROM THAT CONTEMPLATED IN THE DEED IS TO PERMIT HIM TO DEPART FROM THE TERMS AND MANNER OF SALE PRESCRIBED WHENCE COMES HIS AUTHORITY TO DO SO THE CHART OF HIS POWERS AND THE FOUNTAIN OF HIS AUTHORITY IS THE DEED AND IT IS SUBMITTED THAT HE USURPS POWER IF HE SEEKS TO DRAW TO HIMSELF OTHER AUTHORITY THAN THAT WHICH FLOWS FROM THAT FOUNTAINHEAD SURELY THEN UPON PRINCIPLE IT MRUST BE HELD THAT A TRUSTEE CANNOT SELL BE CAUSE OF A DEFAULT IN INTEREST UNLESS THE DEED SO PROVIDES AND SURELY HE OUGHT NOT TO BE PERMITTED TO SELL FOR THE PRINCIPAL WHEN IT IS NOT DUE AND WHEN THERE IS NO CLAUSE PROVIDING THAT THE WHOLE DEBT SHALL BE DUE UPON A FAILURE TO PAY INTEREST 576 JANEXTENSION OF LOANS A MERE PROVISION FOR THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY CANNOT BY ANY POSSIBILITY IMPLY A RIGHT TO FORFEIT THE PRINCIPAL UPON DEFAULT IN THE INTEREST OR A RIGHT TO SELL FOR THE INTEREST DEFAULTED ON COM PETENT PARTIES MAY FAIL TO PROTECT THEMSELVES PROPERLY IN THIS PAR TICULAR JUST AS THEY MAY IN OTHER PARTICULARS AND IN OTHER CONTRACTS BUT IN OUR OPINION CHANCELLOR SUGDEN NEVER ANNOUNCED SUCH A DICTUM AND NEVER INTENDED TO DO SO JONES AND OTHER HIGH AUTHORITIES TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING AN EXAMINATION OF THE CASE OF BURROWES V MOLLOY 2 JONES  LA TOUCHE 521 IN WHICH THE DICTUM IS MAKES IT PLAIN WE THINK THAT THE CHANCELLOR WAS SPEAKING WITH DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE TERMS OF THE PARTICULAR CASE BEFORE HIM AND HAD THE PROVISIONS OF THE DEED IN THAT CASE IN HIS MIND WE DO NOT THINK HE INTENDED MAKING A REMARK OF GENERAL APPLICATION INDEPENDENTLY OF THOSE PROVISIONS THE DEED IN THAT CASE WAS SUBJECT TO A PROVISION WITH REGARD TO PAYING INTEREST WHICH IN EFFECT EXPRESSLY PROVIDES FOR A FORECLOSURE IN THE EVENT OF DE FAULT THEREON THE PARTIES THEREUPON MADE A SECOND DEED RECITING THAT THEY HAD NOT EXPRESSED THEIR REAL INTENTIONS THAT THEY INTENDED THE PRINCIPAL TO REMAIN OUTSTANDING UNTIL AFTER THE DECEASE OF THE MORTGAGOR THE LORD CHANCELLOR UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SAYS IN EFFECT IF THERE WAS ONLY THIS FIRST DEED TO BE CONSIDERED A FORECLOSURE MIGHT BE HAD UNDER ITS TERMS BUT THE SECOND DEED RECITES THAT THE FIRST DOES NOT CORRECTLY SET FORTH THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES AND THAT THEIR REAL INTENT WAS THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE A FORECLOSURE UNTIL AFTER THE HAP PENING OF A CERTAIN EVENT AND THEREFORE NONE CAN BE HAD UNTIL THEN THE MORTGAGE IN THAT CASE WAS IN THE OLD FORM AND ASSIGNED THE PROP ERTY SUBJECT TO A PROVISO THAT IF A SHOULD PAY TO B THE SUM OF 90001 ON THE 1ST DAY OF MAY 1842 TOGETHER WITH THE INTEREST THEREON IN THE MEANTIME AT THE RATE OF  PER CENT PER ANNUM ON EVERY 1ST OF MAY AND 1ST OF NOVEMBER IN EACH YEAR AND SHOULD IN THE MEANTIME PAY THE YEARLY RENT ETC ETC THEN THE INDENTURE AND BOND COLLATERAL THEREWITH SHOULD BE VOID TO MAKE A SIMILAR PROVISION IN A DEED OF TRUST WOULD BE WE SUBMIT TO PROVIDE FOR A SALE BY THE TRUSTEE UPON DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND IN FACT TO PRO VIDE ALSO FOR THE FORFEITURE OF THE PRINCIPAL AND SALE THEREFOR UPON THAT DEFAULT THE LORD CHANCELLOR AFTER RECITING THE PROVISIONS OF THE MORTGAGE WHICH HE DECLARED TO BE IN THE COMMON FORM AND ALSO THE PROVISIONS OF THE DEED OF EVEN DATE THEREWITH WHICH DECLARED THE INTENTION OF 1899 577VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER THE PARTIES TO BE THAT THE PRINCIPAL SUM SHOULD NOT BE CALLED FOR UNTIL AFTER THE DECEASE OF THE MORTGAGOR AND WHICH CONTAINED A COVENANT TO THAT EFFECT ON THE PART OF THE MORTGAGEE CONTINUED AS FOLLOWS SUPPOSING THAT THE PRINCIPAL SUM HAD BEEN MADE PAYABLE ON A GIVEN DAY NO MATTER WHETHER IT WAS ONE YEAR OR TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE MORTGAGE WITH INTEREST THEREON HALFYEARLY IN THE MEANTIME AND THAT BEFORE THE DAY OF PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL MONEY DEFAULT HAD BEEN MADE IN THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST THEREON THE MORTGAGEE WOULD AT ANY TIME AFTER THAT EVENT HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO FILE HIS BILL FOR A FORECLOSURE BECAUSE HIS RIGHT BECAME ABSOLUTE AT LAW BY THE NONPAYMENT OF THE INTEREST THE ESTATE HAVING BEEN CONVEYED SUBJECT TO A CONDITION WHICH HAD NOT BEEN FULFILLED  IT IS CONFIDENTLY INSISTED THAT THIS LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO APPLY TO CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE PARTICULAR CASE BEFORE THE CHANCELLOR AND IS NOT INTENDED TO ANNOUNCE A DOCTRINE FOLLOWING UPON THE SIMPLE SECURING OF INTEREST PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY THE ORDINARY MORTGAGE THEN USED AND THE ONE BEFORE THE CHANCELLOR CONVEYED THE PROPERTY TO THE MORTGAGEE AND THE CONVEYANCE WAS ABSOLUTE EXCEPT FOR THE PROVISION THAT IF THE PRINCIPAL AND THE INTEREST WERE PAID AT THE TIMES AGREED UPON THE INDENTURE SHOULD BE VOID IF THEREFORE THE INTEREST WERE NOT PAID WHEN DUE THE FORFEITURE FOL LOWED AS A MATTER OF COURSE NOT BECAUSE THE LAW IMPLIED ANY SUCH THING ON ACCOUNT OF THE MERE FALLING DUE OF INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY BUT BECAUSE THE FORFEITURE WAS EXPRESSLY CONTRACTED FOR OR AS THE CHAN CELLOR SAYS BECAUSE HIS RIGHT BECAME ABSOLUTE AT LAW BY THE NON PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST THE ESTATE HAVING BEEN CONVEYED SUBJECT TO A CONDITION WHICH HAD NOT BEEN FULFILLED TO WHICH WE ADD THAT THE CONDITION WAS EXPRESS THE CHANCELLORS LANGUAGE THEN IS SCARCELY A DICTUM AT ALL IT SIMPLY DECLARES THE TERMS OF A MORTGAGE SUCH AS THE ONE RECITED PROVIDE FOR A FORECLOSURE IT IS EQUIVALENT TO SAYING IF A MORTGAGE CONVEYS PROPERTY ABSO LUTELY SUBJECT TO THE PROVISO THAT THE CONVEYANCE SHALL BE VOID IF THE MORTGAGOR PAYS A NAMED SUM ON A GIVEN DAY TOGETHER WITH INTEREST THEREON IN THE MEANTIME ON EVERY FIRST OF MAY AND FIRST OF NO EMBER IN EACH YEAR THE CONVEYANCE IS ABSOLUTE IF THE INTEREST IS NOT PAID AND A FORECLOSURE MAY BE HAD THEREUPON BECAUSE IT WAS SO CONTRACTED IT IS PLAIN THAT SUCH A STATEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO A DEED OF TRUST WHICH MERELY SECURES THE PRINCIPAL AND THE SEMIANNUAL INTEREST WITH OUT AUTHORIZING THE TRUSTEE TO SELL FOR THE INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF A DE 578 JANEXTENSION OF LOANS FAULT THEREON OR WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR THE CALLING IN OF THE PRINCIPAL AND A SALE UPON A DEFAULT IN THE INTEREST POWER TO DO THIS MUST BE CONTRACTED FOR AND CANNOT BE IMPLIED THE LANGUAGE OF THE CHANCELLOR REFERRING TO THE DEED OF EVEN DATE WITH THE MORTGAGE WHICH FORBIDS THE CALLING IN OF THE PRINCIPAL DURING THE LIFE OF THE MORTGAGOR IS INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE BOTH AS TO THE NECESSITY OF A CONTRACT IN THESE PARTICULARS AND AS TO THE EFFECT OF A CONTRACT TO LEAVE MONEY OUTSTANDING UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF A GIVEN PERIOD OR UNTIL THE HAPPENING OF A CERTAIN EVENT WHEN UNACCOMPANIED BY SUCH PROVISIONS IN THE CONTRACT AFTER SAYING THAT THE MORTGAGE AS RECITED ABOVE AUTHORIZED A FORE CLOSURE UPON DEFAULT IN THE INTEREST HE CONTINUES BUT HERE THE AGREEMENT WAS DIFFERENT    FROM THE DEED OF COVENANT IT AP PEARS THAT THE REAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES WAS THAT THE PRINCI PAL SUM SHOULD NOT BE CALLED IN UNTIL AFTER THE DECEASE OF THE MORTGAGOR AND THERE IS AN ACTUAL COVENANT BY THE MORTGAGEE TO THAT EFFECT  WHICH IS NOT QUALIFIED BY ANY STIPULATION RESPECTING THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST IN THE MEANTIME IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THIS COVENANT FORBIDS THE CALLING IN OF THE PRIN CIPAL SUM FOR ANY CAUSE DURING THE LIFETIME OF THE MORTGAGOR L WAS AN AGREEMENT TO LEAVE THE MONEY OUTSTANDING DURING THAT TIME WITHOUT ANY PROVISION FOR FORECLOSURE IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR A FORFEITURE OF THE CREDIT BECAUSE OF THAT DEFAULT IT WAS IN FACT A NEGATIVE FORM OF THE CONTRACT OF EX TENSION WHICH GAVE RISE TO THIS DISCUSSION IT PROVIDES THAT THE PRIN CIPAL SHALL NOT BE CALLED IN UNTIL THE HAPPENING OF A CERTAIN EVENT WHEREAS THE CONTRACT OF EXTENSION COMMENTED UPON PROVIDES THAT THE LOAN SHOULD BE FOR A FIXED PERIOD NEITHER CONTRACT PROVIDED FOR FORE CLOSURE ON ACCOUNT OF DEFAULT IN INTEREST THE CHANCELLOR SAYS INTEREST WAS TO BE PAID HALFYEARLY UPON THE PRINCIPAL SUM    BUT THE COVENANT IS INDEPENDENT OF EVERYTHING CONTAINED IN THE DEED OF MORTGAGE   I DO NOT SEE HOW ANY DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST DURING THE LIFETIME OF THE MORTGAGOR CAN ENABLE THE MORTGAGEE TO COMMIT A BREACH OF HIS COVE NANT IT WAS SAID THAT THIS WAS LIKE A CASE WHERE ALTHOUGH THE MONEY WAS BY THE PROVISO FOR REDEMPTION TO BE PAID AT A FIXED PERIOD YET THE MORTGAGEE COVENANTS THAT HE WILL NOT CALL IN THE PRINCIPAL FOR A LONGER PERIOD UNLESS DEFAULT SHOULD BE MADE IN THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST IN THE MEANTIME BUT THE PARTIES HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO SUCH AN AR RANGEMENT I THINK THEREFORE THAT UNDER THESE INSTRUMENTS THE 1899 579580 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JAN PLAINTIFF WAS NOT AT LIBERTY TO FILE HIS BILL FOR A FORECLOSURE AS FAR AS RELATES TO THE PRINCIPAL MONEY  AND THEREFORE CANNOT DO SO IN RESPECT OF THE INTEREST WHICH ACCRUED BEFORE THE PRINCIPAL SUM BECAME PAYA BLE IT MAY BE CONCLUDED THEREFORE FIRST THAT THE MORTGAGE CONTRACT MAY BE FOR A LOAN FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OR UNTIL THE HAPPENING OF A CERTAIN EVENT AND THE CREDITOR BE WITHOUT A REMEDY SO FAR AS A FORE CLOSURE GOES UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE PERIOD OR THE HAPPENING OF THE EVENT NOTWITHSTANDING SEMIANNUAL INTEREST IS STIPULATED FOR AND DE FAULT IS MADE IN ITS PAYMENT SECOND THIS MAY BE SO EITHER BECAUSE THERE IS AN EXPRESS CONTRACT THAT THE PRINCIPAL SHALL NOT BE CALLED IN DURING A SPECIFIED TIME WITHOUT ANY STIPULATION OR QUALIFICATION RESPECT ING THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST IN THE MEANTIME OR IT MAY BE SO BE CAUSE THERE IS AN EXPRESS AGREEMENT TO LEND A CERTAIN SUM FOR A FIXED PERIOD WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR A FORECLOSURE OR A FORFEITURE ON ACCOUNT OF DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST IN THE MEANTIME IN BOTH CASES THERE MAY BE A PROVISION CALLING FOR SEMIANNUAL INTEREST WITHOUT CHANG ING THE RESULT THE EFFECT OF THE NONPAYMENT OF INTEREST UPON THE CONTRACT TO LEND MUST BE PROVIDED FOR OR AT THE LEAST THE LOAN MUST BE MADE EXPRESSLY ON THE CONDITION OF REMAINING OUTSTANDING AS LONG AS OR PROVIDED THE INTEREST IS PAID IN THE MEANTIME AND AT THE TIMES STIPULATED THE CASE OF BURROWES V MOLLOY SUPRA THEREFORE SO FAR FROM FURNISHING AUTHORITY FOR THE DOCTRINE THAT DEFAULT IN THE HALFYEARLY INTEREST GIVES A RIGHT TO FORECLOSE IMMEDIATELY THOUGH THE PRINCIPAL SUM IS NOT DUE AND THERE IS NO PROVISION MAKING A FORFEITURE OF THE PRINCIPAL UPON A DEFAULT IN THE INTEREST SEEMS WHEN PROPERLY CONSID ERED TO BE CLEAR AUTHORITY THE OTHER WAY NOT ONLY DID THE CASE PRO VIDE FOR A FORFEITURE BUT THE SOCALLED DICTUM OF THE CHANCELLOR MAKES IT PLAIN THAT HE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE FORFEITURE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE EXPLANATORY DEED BECAUSE THE MORTGAGE DID PROVIDE FOR IT AND THE EXPLANATORY DEED HAVING PROVIDED THAT THE PRINCIPAL SHOULD NOT BE CALLED IN UNTIL AFTER THE HAPPENING OF A CERTAIN EVENT THE CHAN CELLOR FORBADE A FORFEITURE NOTWITHSTANDING INTEREST WAS TO BE PAID HALF YEARLY ON THE PRINCIPAL SUM AND THERE WAS A DEFAULT BECAUSE THE EVENT HAD NOT HAPPENED AND THERE WAS NO STIPULATION WITH RESPECT TO THE PAY MENT OF INTEREST IN THE MEANTIME QUALIFYING THAT PROVISION THE CHAN CELLOR MOREOVER REFUSED TO IDENTIFY THE CASE WITH AN AGREEMENT ON THE PART OF THE MORTGAGEE NOT TO CALL IN THE PRINCIPAL FOR A LONGER PERIOD THAN THAT ORIGINALLY CONTRACTED FOR UNLESS DEFAULT SHOULD BE MADE IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST IN THE MEANTIME SAYING THAT THE PARTIES HAD NOTEXTENSION OF LOANS ENTERED INTO SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT THAT IS TO SAY THERE WAS NO SUCH PROVISION IN THE DEED JONES FALLS INTO A SIMILAR MISTAKE IN SUPPOSING THAT RODDY V WIL LIAMS 3 JONES AND LATOUCHE 1 SUPPORTS THE SOCALLED DICTUM DOC TRINE OF THE LORD CHANCELLOR SEE JONES ON MORTGAGES SEC 1178 THAT CASE DOES NOT ANNOUNCE THE JAW AS JONES STATES IT THE CASE WAS ONE IN WHICH THE DEED ASSIGNED AND CONVEYED TO RODDY CERTAIN PROPERTY SUBJECT TO THE PROVISO THAT THE DEED SHOULD BE VOID UPON THE PAYMENT ON THE 1ST OF AUGUST 1845 OF THE PRINCIPAL WITH INTEREST THEREON AT THE RATE OF  PER CENT PER ANNUM BY HALFYEARLY PAYMENTS ON EVERY 1ST OF FEBRUARY AND 1ST OF AUGUST IN EVERY YEAR THERE WAS CONTENTION THAT THE INTEREST WAS EXPRESSED TO BE PAYABLE ON THE 1ST OF AUGUST 1845 AND THAT NO FORECLOSURE COULD BE HAD UNTIL THEN THE DECISION OF THE CHANCELLOR IN EFFECT HELD THAT NOT WITHSTANDING THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WERE EXPRESSED TO BE PAYABLE AT THE END OF SEVERAL YEARS IT WAS YET APPARENT ON THE WHOLE MORT GAGEDEED THAT THE AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES WAS THAT THE INTEREST SHOULD BE PAID HALFYEARLY IN THE MEANTIME IT IS TRUE THE DECISION ALLOWED A FORECLOSURE BUT IT WAS NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE IT WAS APPARENT ON THE WHOLE DEED THAT THE PARTIES INTENDED THE INTEREST TO BE PAID HALFYEARLY IN THE MEANTIME AS JONES IN SECTION 1178 AND INDEED AS THE REPORTER OF THE CASE SEEMS TO SUPPOSE ALL THE CHANCELLOR SAID ON THE POINT WAS THIS THE CASE IS CLEAR TO THIS EXTENT THAT THE MORTGAGES ORIGINALLY MADE TO THE PLAINTIFF WERE SUCH THAT IN THE EVENTS WHICH HAVE HAPPENED THEY WOULD BUT FOR THE DEEDS OF 1840 HAVE ENTITLED THE PLAINTIFF TO FORECLOSE THEM IF THEREFORE THE PLAINTIFF IS DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHTS HE ACQUIRED AND THE REMEDIES INCIDENT TO THOSE RIGHTS UNDER THE MORTGAGE DEED IT MUST BE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DEEDS OF 1840 WHICH I AM ASKED TO DECLARE VOID THE REST OF THE DECISION DISCUSSES THESE DEEDS OF 1840 AND HOLDS THEM TO BE FRAUDULENT AND VOID TURNING TO THE MORTGAGE WE NOT ONLY FIND THAT A FORFEITURE IS EX PRESSLY PROVIDED FOR AND A FORECLOSURE ADMISSIBLE BECAUSE THE CONVEY ANCE WAS TO BE ABSOLUTE IF THE INTEREST WAS NOT PAID  ON EVERY 1ST OF FEBRUARY ETC IN EVERY YEAR BUT WE ALSO FIND THIS COVENANT AND JAMES WILLIAMS COVENANTS THAT IF AT ANY TIME HEREAFTER THE INTEREST ON THE PRINCIPAL SUM OR ANY PART THEREOF SHOULD BE BEHIND OR UNPAID FOR THE SPACE OF TWO MONTHS NEXT AFTER ANY OF THE DAYS WHEREON THE SAME OUGHT TO BE PAID ETC ETC IT SHALL BE LAWFUL FOR RODDY TO SELL AND DISPOSE OF THE MORTGAGED PREMISES FOR SUCH PRICE AS CAN BE HAD 1899 581VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FOR THE SAME WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TAKING ANY PROCEEDINGS AT LAW OR IN EQUITY TO FORECLOSE THE MORTGAGE WE DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO COMMENT ON THE CASE FURTHER AS IT IS APPARENT THAT FORECLOSURE WAS DUE NOT TO ANY IMPLICATION BY THE LAW CONSEQUENT UPON THE INTEREST BEING PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY BUT TO THE EXPRESS CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PARTIES IT IS WORTH WHILE PERHAPS TO EMPHASIZE THIS INHERENT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OLDFASHIONED MORT GAGE PASSED UPON BY CHANCELLOR SUGDEN AND THE MORE MODERN DEED OF TRUST IN THE FORMER THE MORTGAGOR CONVEYED HIS PROPERTY NOT IN TRUST BUT IN THE FORM OF AN ABSOLUTE CONVEYANCE SUBJECT HOWEVER TO AVOIDANCE BY THE PERFORMANCE ON HIS PART OF THE CONDITIONS SET OUT IN THE REDEMPTION CLAUSE THESE CONDITIONS INVARIABLY WE SUPPOSE INCLUDED THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AT A DESIGNATED FUTURE TIME AND THE INTEREST AT FIXED TIMES IN EACH YEAR IN THE MEANTIME WHEN THEREFORE THE LORD CHANCELLOR SPEAKS OF THE PROPERTY  HAVING BEEN CONVEYED SUBJECT TO A CONDITION WHICH HAD NOT BEEN FULFILLED  HE HAS REFEREI E TO THE EX PRESS CONDITION OF THE MORTGAGE TOWIT THAT THE CONVEYA ICE SHALL BE VOID ONLY ON CONDITION THAT THE INTEREST IS PAID AT THE STIPULATED TIMES IN EACH YEAR HE DOES NOT BY ANY MEANS INTEND TO CONVEY THE IDEA THAT THE MERE CONTRACT FOR INTEREST PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY OF ITSELF CREATES A RIGHT TO FORECLOSE FOR THE WHOLE AMOUNT WHEN UNACCOMPANIED BY THE CONDITION OF THE OLD MORTGAGE WHICH IN TERMS MADE THE CONVEYANCE ABSOLUTE UNLESS THE INTEREST WAS SO PAID THE OLD MORTGAGE THEN IN FACT CONTAINED IN ITS TERMS THE DIRECT PROVISION FOR A FORFEITURE AND CONSEQUENT FORECLOSURE WHICH WE HAVE CONTENDED IN THIS PAPER MUST BE INCLUDED IN A DEED OF TRUST OR IN A CONTRACT TO EXTEND A LOAN SECURED BY DEED OF TRUST IF A FORECLOSURE IS TO BE HAD PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF THE PRINCIPAL SUM ON PRINCIPLE WE THINK OUR CONTENTION IS DEMONSTRABLY CLEAR AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY DECISIONS HOLDING THAT A FORECLOSURE MAY BE HAD ON DEFAULT IN THE SEMIANNUAL INTEREST INDEPENDENTLY OF A PROVISION FOR FORFEITURE OF THE PRINCIPAL ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY WILL ALL BE FOUND WE BELIEVE TO REST UPON THE SUPPOSED DICTUM OF CHANCELLOR SUGDEN WHICH IS THOUGHT AND SAID BY THEM TO SO DECIDE THIS WE THINK WE HAVE SHOWN IS A MISCONCEPTION OF THE CHANCELLORS LANGUAGE AND IN OUR OPINION THE LAW WILL FORBID AND THE COURTS ENJOIN A SALE IF ATTEMPTED PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF THE PRINCIPAL 26 AM  ENG ENCY L 972 2 JONES ON MORTGAGES 1191 53 VT 92 UNLESS THE 582 JANEXTENSION OF LOANS CONTRACT ACTUALLY PROVIDES EITHER FOR THE FORECLOSURE OR SALE AS TO IN TEREST OR FOR THE FORFEITURE OF THE PRINCIPAL UPON DEFAULT BEING MADE IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AT THE TIMES STIPULATED THESE POINTS THEN MUST BE CONSIDERED AND PROVIDED FOR WHENEVER A LOAN SECURED BY DEED OF TRUST IS TO BE EXECUTED IN SUCH A CASE MOREOVER THE STATUTES OF PAROL AGREEMENTS AND OF REGISTRY MUST BE KEPT IN MIND AND THE CONTRACT REDUCED TO WRITING AND RECORDED IF RE QUIRED TO BE SO BY THOSE STATUTES IT IS BELIEVED THAT AGENTS MAKING LOANS VERY GENERALLY IGNORE THE LAW IN THESE PARTICULARS AND NOT ONLY MAKE PAROL CONTRACTS OF EXTENSION WITHOUT REGARD TO THEM BUT EXECUTE TRUST DEEDS IN DEFIANCE OF THEM IT IS NOT BELIEVED HOWEVER THAT THE PRACTICE COULD BE JUSTIFIED AS A CUSTOM OF BUSINESS OF WHICH EVERYONE IS HELD TO BE COGNIZANT BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSED THE CUSTOM MUST BE HELD TO BE ILLEGAL THE SAFE COURSE IS TO REDUCE THE CONTRACT TO WRITING THOUGH IT MAY BE BY PAROL AND TO SPECIFY WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN CASE OF DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST BOTH AS REGARDS FORFEITING THE PRINCIPAL AND FORE CLOSING FOR THE INTEREST GEORGE WAYNE ANDERSON RICHMOND VA 1899 583

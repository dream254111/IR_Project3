In November 1920 the writer was asked to prepare a study of language teaching in the state of Iowa the information for which was available in the records on file in the office of the state superin tendent of public instruction In September of each year every school in the state is required to send to the state superintendent a report specifying the names salaries collegiate preparation and teaching experience of all members of the instructional staff In regard to the course of study there is prepared a schedule of each teachers activities during the day showing the number of classes he teaches the subjects taught the number of pupils in each class and the names of the textbooks used Through the courtesy of the state superintendent permission was obtained to tabulate these data from the card records in his office Since the preparation and verification of the tables were not completed until December the returns available for this study were practically complete for the whole state The investigation consequently has a great advantage over one conducted by the questionnaire method in that the report includes information of some sort concerning 96 per cent of the schools in the state High schools in the state of Iowa are classified according to three types consolidated normaltraining and other approved schools Consolidated schools are those located in consolidated school districts normaltraining schools are those in which are offered normaltraining course the completion of which on the part of the student entitles him to a Uniform County Teachers Certificate other approved high schools are those which are not included in the first two classes but which are approved by the state inspector of secondary schools for tuition purposes Of these three types the nonnrmaltraining schools include in their number practi cally all the high schools in the larger towns and cities 61oFOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING IN IOWA 611 It was deemed advisable in the tables presented to give the figures for each type of school separately in addition to the grand total for the reason that conditions in the three classes of schools are sometimes very different with respect to certain phases of the problem From the data presented in Table I the following significant facts are evident i Latin is by far the language most frequently taught in those high schools of Iowa

French Spanish and Norse 4 No German is taught in the high schools reporting 5 French is the only modern foreign language that receives serious consideration in the course of study It is to be noted that the number of schools in Table II does not correspond with the number found in Table I This discrepancy612 THE SCHOOL REVIEW October is due to the fact that Table II includes those schools which not only report the number of students in every class and the number of classes taught but also specify the different school years in which each year of the particular language course of study is

in Table I do not give complete data concerning these points The item that stands out con spicuously in Table II is the much larger number of students studying Latin than any of the other three languages Not only is the number larger but the proportion of students to the total enrolment of the various schools is over twice as large for Latin as for French or Spanish In the 445 schools that offer Latin nearly 30 per cent of the students are studying this subject whereas in the 87 schools offering French only 12 per cent of the students are in French classes1921 FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING IN IOWA 613 So far as the absolute size of classes is concerned there seems to exist practically no difference between the subjects Classes are small in consolidated schools while the general average for all schools and all languages is twelve members to the class An elaboration of Table II was made to discover the relation that exists between any one language and other languages taught in the same school or what the situation was when only one language was taught The table omitted from this article again showed a decided preponderance of Latin 355 of the 467 schools reporting teach Latin as the only foreign language and in these schools are to be found almost 70 per cent of the total number of students studying Latin Twothirds of the 61 schools in which both Latin and French are offered are of the normaltraining type representing the larger schools in the state Here the proportion of Latin students to French students is in the ratio of two and one third to one The Latin classes are also slightly larger in size than those in French Again the normaltraining schools are practically the only ones that offer the combinations of Latin and Spanish and Latin French and Spanish In the case of Latin and Spanish we find practically the same relation as exists between Latin and French while in the six schools which offer all three languages the combined number of students taking French and Spanish is almost equal to the number of those taking Latin Of the three languages other than Latin French is the only one that is offered to any extent as an only language in the course of study This situation is especially true of the approved type of school A similar detailed comparison was made showing how many of the schools offering Latin give one two three or four years to the subject and also the number of pupils enrolled It was found that the most frequent offering is that of Latin I and Caesar about onehalf of the 445 schools in which Latin is taught providing for these two courses The number is evenly distributed between the three types of schools Fiftytwo per cent of all the students who are studying Latin are enrolled in schools that offer but the first two years while 22 per cent are found in schools offering only Latin I Just as was found to be the case in regard to combinations of various languages we find that normaltraining schools are614 THE SCHOOL REVIEW October practically the only ones to offer three and four years of Latin or the combinations of either Latin I Caesar and Cicero or Latin I Caesar and Virgil There are practically as many schools offering first and second year French as offer firstyear French only None of the consoli dated schools present data concerning enrolment in the twoyear combination although one is reported as having two years work in French The same statement is true of four years of French Another fact to note is that the schools which offer two years of French have an enrolment two and onehalf times as large as those that offer French I only though the number of schools is practically the same The situation with regard to Spanish is similar to the case of French Larger schools are the only ones to offer this language In the eight normaltraining schools that offer two years of the subject we find 62 per cent of the total number of students studying this language Another question of interest is the level at which any given years work in the foreign language is studied When is firstyear Latin most commonly taught  We find that the type of school makes a decided difference in the position of Latin I in the curricu lum and the consequent position of Caesar which in almost all cases is given in the year following that in which Latin I is taught In the consolidated and approved schools the approved schools consist largely of the smaller schools throughout the state first year Latin is offered in the third year and Caesar in the fourth year Of course it is to be expected that Cicero will be offered in the third year and Virgil in the fourth year of larger schools although we do find cases in which Virgil is offered in the third year French is almost universally offered in the last two years of the highschool course French I in the third year and French II in the fourth Third and fourthyear French are reported from only one school Again the situation that has been illustrated in the case of French is paralleled in that of Spanish Many schools failed to make a report concerning the language textbooks but from the information presented by those reporting we may determine the textbooks most commonly used in each of the languages1921 FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING IN IOWA 615 With the exception of the Smith texts in which case few of the schools specified whether they were using Smiths Elements of Latin TABLE III TEXTBOOKS IN LATIN AND FRENCH IN USE IN THE SCHOOLS REPORTING CONSOLI NORMAL OTHER DATED TRAINING APPROVED HIGH HIGH HIGH

Lessons616 THE SCHOOL REVIEW or Smiths Latin Lessons the Collar and Daniel is the most fre quently used text In secondyear Latin Walker has decidedly the preference although Kelseys book is used as largely in consolidated schools and to a considerable extent in the approved schools In Cicero the only two texts being used are those of Bennett and Kelsey with practically no difference in the relative standing In Virgil the field is again limited to two Knapp and Bennett In firstyear French there are but two textbooks that are used to any great extent These are Chardenal and Fraser and Squair As for secondyear French with the exception of mention of the fact that classics are read no specific information as to texts is given Fourteen of the schools offering Spanish reported concerning the textbooks in use Of the texts mentioned only that of De Vitis is used in as many as four schools SUMMARY This investigation has shown that in the state of Iowa for the school year 192021 there are four foreign languages being taught namely Latin French Spanish and Norse and that this order represents the frequency of occurrence of these languages Latin is taught in more schools whether singly or in combination than any other foreign language The number of students enrolled in Latin courses is almost five times the number studying other foreign languages The most frequent combination with Latin is French French is offered in onefourth the number of schools that teach Latin and occurs more frequently in combination with Latin than by itself Similarly Spanish is offered in onefourth the number of schools that teach French Although normaltraining schools are less in number than the consolidated and other approved schools they have a much larger enrolment from 50 to 75 per cent of the total for each group as shown in Table II Consequently they enrol more students in their language courses The larger number of schools give but two years of any one foreign language This instruction is offered in the first two years of high school in the larger schools and in the last two years in the smaller schools

j100341,The Review of Economics and Statistics,1924554,Recent Developments in World Finance,i333088,RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN WORLD FINANCE JOSEPH S DAVIS FINANCIAL statistics while generally more accessible reliable and uptodate than other classes of economic statistics present only part of the picture of the economic situation They cannot be safely interpreted without a knowledge of other economic events and con ditions The attempt to interpret them by them selves is peculiarly dangerous when currency ex pansion and contraction changes in commodity prices and movements of foreign exchange are as violent as they have been in most countries since the close of the Great War The present writer therefore vigorously dis sents from the socalled  dictum of finance that the position of a central bank of issue accurately reflects the economic condition of a country bar ring mismanagement of the banks business I from the view that the depreciation of the ex changes of the various European countries roughly reflects the economic deterioration of each 2 and from the conclusion that recent financial facts evidence a European decadence which threatens civilization I On the contrary one who studies the whole evidence from Europe since the armistice can hardly escape the conclu sion that fundamental and important economic progress may take place in the face of objection able policies of government finance rising public debts the severe depreciation of a currency and a falling rate of exchange and that central bank showings may improve and exchange rates may rise without necessarily signifying or even fore casting fundamental economic improvement The present article like the writers previous general surveys in this REVIEW deals primarily with certain financial aspects of the worlds eco nomic developments It is written however in the light of considerable evidence upon the funda mentals of agriculture transportation industry and trade which cannot here be set forth in de tail Unfortunately it is difficult for any one person to gather and assimilate adequate evi dence of this kind from the diverse sections of our still disorganized economic world and too often one must present a judgment based upon partial evidence rather than a conclusion from a convincing array of facts Suffice it to say that the writer has attempted to obtain a fair per spective and that readers must supplement and check that perspective by their own4 1 William Dreher Annalist February 6 I922 p II9 2 Bass and Moulton America and the Balance Skeet of Europe New York I92I p 9 Compare however the state ment on p gi On the whole we must conclude that the movement of exchange rates during the past year throws very little light upon fundamental conditions abroad This vol ume while readable informing and stimulating is in error upon several important points and suffers from a distorted perspective arising partly from the almost entire neglect of the nonfinancial economic factors The present writer although by no means enthusiastic about Europes recovery or unaware of its critical difficulties is unable to accept without grave dif ferences either the books dismal interpretation of the events of I9I92I its dire predictions of catastrophe and collapse or its suggestions for grandiose remedies 8 Ibid p 36i 4A general survey of the European situation without much citation of detailed evidence appeared in our Weekly Letter of April 8 The conclusions there presented are i Because of the enormity of the destruction disorgan ization and maladjustment caused by the war recovery and readjustment must necessarily be a long slow process This process is retarded by the inevitable difficulties of international cooperation public and private intensified by warengendered hatreds by political and social revolutions and by territorial changes and the creation of new states The situation pro vokes impatience but should not lead to despair nor should some evidence of clear improvement evoke unrestrained optimism 2 In important economic respects definite progress in re covery has been made in most European countries despite currency inflation dislocated exchanges and unbalanced budgets Financial evidence though important cannot safely be interpreted except in the light of evidence upon agriculture industry trade and transportation 3 The business depression of I92022 could not humanly speaking have been avoided Serious and painful though it has been to the stronger nations it has not prevented progress in recovery on the continent of Europe and it has measurably facilitated essential readjustments of industry trade and finance both there and elsewhere 4 Although dangerous tendencies are not yet eliminated and weighty problems remain to be solved the danger of col lapse or catastrophe is definitely smaller and the constructive forces are materially stronger than at any time since the close of the war 5 No one nation no one act or omission to act no one conference no one scheme will prevent or precipitate the re covery and readjustment they can merely hasten or retard the process In general grandiose schemes are destined to fail The situation calls for attack upon the outstanding problems one by one and their solution piecemeal and gradually rather than simultaneously and comprehensively It calls for inter national cooperation so far as that is feasible for independent C 62 DEVELOPMENTS IN WORLD FINANCE 63 The topics here considered are the following I money rates and security prices II currency and credit expansion and contraction III gold reserves and gold movements IV commodity prices and business failures and V the course of foreign exchange The important questions of international indebtedness including the vexed problem of German reparations and the problem of international credits and the flow of capital are touched upon incidentally if at all I MONEY RATES AND SECURITY PRICES Money rates continue the downward tendency begun last spring Changes in central bank rates have been consistently downward since April I92I after i6 months of continuously rising rates Indeed since early in February I92I the only increases in rates have been those of Vienna from 5 per cent to 6 in April and from 6 to 7 per cent in December I921 The declines however have been less general than the increases of I9I9 20 Reductions have been one per cent or more only in the United States Great Britain Switzer land the Scandinavian countries and very re cently France where until March I922 the Bank of France had reduced its discount rate only one half of one per cent and its rate on collateral loans not at all No reductions have yet been made in southern European countries Finland or Japan where increases of one per cent or more were made in I9I920 or in Holland and Ger many where no increases took place As indi cated in Chart i showing an average of thirteen central bank rates the decline has been on the whole less considerable than the advance and in recent months it has been at a more moderate rate The movements in British and American money markets which have been especially af fected by the business reaction merit closer scrutiny Monthly changes in significant rates are therefore shown in Charts 2 and 3 In both countries central bank rates have fallen from 7 per cent to 42 per cent in less than a year the Bank of England rate in general declining more slowly than the rediscount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rates on British treasury bills fell from 6 per cent in April I92I to less than 3 per cent in exceptional weeks even below 3 per cent Here the extent of the decline is attributable partly to the policy of high money rates maintained until March ii I92I partly to the introduction of the tender system for treasury bills on April 2I I92I and partly to special factors2 Rates on American treasury certificates of indebtedness have fallen CHART

of the much larger de cline in other American rates this reduction is remarkable for its moderateness Rates on bankers bills in London have fallen pari passu with rates on treasury bills remaining slightly higher than these rates and as usual somewhat under the bank rate No comparable series ex ists in the American market Rates on trade bills in London have fallen slightly more than the bank rate from a level of 7 to 72 per cent to a level around 4 to 5 per cent Similarly in New York rates on 60go day commercial paper have fallen from a height of 8 per cent to well under 5 per cent In both instances these rates which are reasonably comparable are above the batik rates Allowing for differences in classification shortterm money rates are today not far from the same level in the two countries The decline in money rates in the past year was due primarily to the liquidation of loans the very moderate demand for new credit and the accumulation of reserves on the part of the banks  in short to increasing monetary ease characteristic of a business depression While the increases in treasury and bank rates were imposed to restrict dangerous credit expansion3 the reductions in treasury rates have reflected and reductions in bank rates have followed the decline in market rates Despite the continued sagging of money rates the contrast is striking between current rates and those in previous periods of depression For 2I months in I89495 and for I3 months in I90809 the New York rate on 6090 day com mercial paper in New York was under 4 per cent In I89495 it averaged 3 per cent and in I904 05 4 per cent for over a year During most of I89798 it was under 4 per cent4 Contrast the recent rates which have only recently fallen be low 5 per cent In Great Britain the same con trast is observable in even more striking measure Bank rates of 2 21 and 3 per cent have been com mon in previous periods of depression the recent minimum is only 42 per cent Rates on 3 months bankers bills were under 3 per cent through most of I908 and I909 and for i8 months they aver aged around 2 per cent5 In the present in stance after i8 months of depression these rates fell below 4 per cent only in the latter part of I92I and stand some 2 per cent higher than in the corresponding period in I90809 when the depression was far less acute The higher level of rates today as compared with prewar years is clearly related to the higher rate of true interest which prevails today because of the greater demand for savings rela tive to the supply available The relatively smaller disparity in American rates is to be at tributed mainly to the operation of the federal reserve system and to the fact that America is today a lender of savings and credit rather than CEART 3NEw YoRx MoNEY RATES

whereas Great Britain has a smaller real surplus for investment It is by no means clear that money rates have yet touched bottom even in Great Britain or in the United States but increased demands for credit are already in evidence and the further decline if any bids fair to be inconsiderable and shortlived provided banking leaders persist in their policy of refusing to undertake to stimulate business activity by radical reductions The pro posed soldiers bonus legislation in the United States in Mr Mellons opinion will make for higher money rates American bankers and the federal reserve board in particular have wisely been giving care ful study to the standards determining the proper discount rate by federal reserve banks The factors affecting the decision to raise or lower rates have been carefully considered and certain conclusions have been reached such as that it is not practicable for federal reserve banks to main tain rediscount rates higher than rates on line of credit loans and that ordinarily a borrowing federal reserve bank should not be permitted to reduce its rate Although no clear guiding prin ciples have been formulated it is reasonably evi dent that the board and its advisory council recognize the dangers of fresh gold inflation and will be alert to restrain tendencies in that direction In Switzerland and the Scandinavian coun tries the decline in rates has been similar to that in Great Britain and the United States In Japan where the bank rate stands unchanged the decline in market rates has been considerable From ii per cent in June I920 the average dis count rate in the Tokyo market declined to 8 per cent in September 192I since then however it has risen appreciably2 In Belgium France and Italy the decline in market rates has been moderate and rates remain above those prevail ing at the end of I919 The French minister of finance ventured only as lately as March I2 to re duce and then onlybyonehalf of one per cent the rate on treasury bills and national defense bills and the reduction of the bank rate to 5 per cent waited upon this action by the government In Holland moreover where the bank rate has not been altered money rates have been fairly stable not far below the current rate of 4N per cent In Berlin outside rates were somewhat higher and in Vienna considerably higher at the end of I92I than in the two preceding years3 Accompanying the decline in money rates dur ing I92I has been a recovery in bond prices or conversely a decline in yields on investment securities This is clearly evidenced by the va rious index numbers of bond prices prepared in the United States Great Britain the Nether lands and Switzerland and by the corresponding tables of interest yields prepared for Sweden In France on the other hand bond prices slightly declined and the interest yield on new issues has stood fairly constant around 67 per cent4 Table i summarizes selected evidence of these movements outside the United States Stocks have not shared equally in this im provement in bond values In general high grade investment stocks and public utility stocks favored by declining commodity prices have tended upwards rather than downwards as for example railway shares in London and Paris Ordinary industrial and commercial stocks have generally declined though the rate of decline was much lower than in I920 In most cases however an upward movement appeared some time in the second half of I92I which is continu ing in the early months of I922 The London Economist recently made an in teresting comparison of average rates of interest offered on different classes of securities issued on the London market during I9I3 I920 and I92I Table 2 summarizes these averages It will be noted that rates on British government loans which amounted in I92I to about 200 millions pounds more than half of the total issues de clined considerably during I92I from an average of nearly 7 per cent in I920 to an average of 57 per cent in I92I Municipal corporation issues showed no material change yielding about 62 per cent in both years On other classes of secu rities including colonial and foreign government 1 See especially Governor Hardings contribution on  Prin ciples Governing the Discount Rate to the Annals of the American Academny of Political and Social Science January 1922 pp I83I89 and the two articles following by G M Reynolds and C A Phillips 2 Federal Reserve Bulletin February 1922 p 194 3 Societe de Banque Suisse Bulletin Mensuel fin d6cembre 1921 p 227 4 Data of LAssociation Nationale des Porteurs Fransais de Valeurs Mobilires quoted by LEconomiste Europen66 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS loans and industrial debentures and preference shares rates averaged somewhat higher in I92I than in I920 Rates on colonial and foreign government loans were over 2 per cent higher and rates on industrial bonds and shares were over 2 per cent higher in I92I than in I9I3 This is an increase somewhat larger than the increase in the income tax On new savings therefore investors may secure a net return ap preciably higher than before the war even after paying the high income tax rates and may look forward to appreciation in their securities when income rates fall Speaking not of short periods but rather of a period of several years an upward trend in prices of bonds and investment stocks and a corresponding decline in interest yields will be a normal accompaniment of reductions in taxation and the replacement of the capital destroyed or deteriorated during the war Inasmuch how ever as during the I5 years preceding the war interest yields were rising and bond prices were tending downwards the extent to which interest yields may fall and investment securities may rise is dependent upon the continuance or re versal of fundamental influences which were operating before I9I4 The course of security prices in leading coun tries has been similar to that in previous periods of prolonged depression Declining demandsfor TABLE I INDEx NUMBERS OF BoND PRICES OR INTEREST YIELDS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES I92021 GREAT BsRTAIN NETHERLANDS SWEDEN Aggregate values million pounds Index

on the part of banks business concerns and private investors Improving conditions and prospects in commerce and industry with the stimulus of lower rates for shortterm and longterm credit lead to a trans fer of part of this demand from the bond market to the stock market Thus a substantial rise in stocks occurs somewhat later than in bonds and in some measure their recovery tends to check the rise of bond prices The course of security prices in Germany and other countries whose currencies and exchanges are demoralized cannot be discussed in this con nection Not only are no satisfactory indices available  for the Frankfurter Zeitung index numbers contain much too varied a list to be val uable  but the whole movement of security prices is violently influenced by the course of ex change and the speculative purchases and sales by foreigners as well as Germans In such coun tries security prices in no way reflect variations in money rates or interest yields and they belong to quite another part of the financial story II CURRENCY AND CREDIT EXPAN SION AND CONTRACTION Currency inflation proceeds apace in Germany Russia Poland Austria Hungary Roumania Greece and Portugal It has been substantially checked in Belgium Italy Spain Finland Bul garia CzechoSlovakia and JugoSlavia where it was proceeding at a considerable rate through out I920 In other countries where inflation was checked in I920 and in certain of those last men tioned some contraction took place in I92I though in general at quite a moderate rate in view of the business depression and declines in commodity prices The substantial check to currency expansion in I92I in several countries on the continent while attributable in part to business depression implies an increased control over the inifluences making for instability of prices and exchange and accompanies a moderate improvement both in government finance and economic position The continued inflation in several important countries while not indicating general retro gression does evidence a serious deficiency in government revenues and an important disturb ing influence in economic activity as a whole Somewhat dferent causes operate in the dif ferent countries to produce this inflation In Germany the weakness of the government in re ducing staffs and domestic expenses and imposing new taxes and the complications introduced by the requirement of reparation payments have been the leading factors In Austria the ex treme weakness of the government is less im portant than the disorganization of industry and trade which followed the breakup of the old em pire and the creation of several new states jealous of their political independence and inadequately aware of the importance of maintaining eco nomic unity In Poland the leading influences have been the difficulty of recovery from the wars destruction complicated by the Russian invasion of I920 and the Upper Silesian disturb ances of I92I In Greece the Turkish war is mainly responsible It must be emphasized that it is essentially to these countries and not to the entire continent that one must refer today in speaking of currency chaos for elsewhere the turning point toward stable currencies has been made even though the end is far from attained Three errors are frequent in discussions of cur rency inflation The first is that inflation re flects economic degeneration This is by no means generally true It does usually reflect an abnormal excess of fiscal expenditures over reven ues but the check to inflation where it has been TABLE 2  COMPARATIVE RATES

cent in I92068 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS checked has usually preceded even the balancing of budgets and in most countries even in Poland inflation has continued while fundamental eco nomic conditions have improved The second error lies in regarding currency inflation prima rily as a cause of economic deterioration Rather it is a result of the lack of economic and fiscal equilibrium which reacts unfavorably upon prog ress without necessarily preventing that progress A third error lies in the assumption that infla tion can be checked by a simple determination not to issue more notes or to balance budgets The problem is far less simple Increase of tax revenues must be gradual unless business is to be seriously disturbed Government expenditures can be reduced but gradually without grave maladjustments in such respects as employment and the food supply Investors can only gradu ally be induced to lend their real savings to governments which have been in great fiscal dis tress The proper objectives are clear improve ment in productivity reduction in government expenditures increases in government revenues restoration of trade equilibrium increased thrift and larger confidence of investors in govern ments Progress in these directions leads first to moderation in currency inflation then to a defi nite check to inflation and finally to moderate currency contraction Only after considerable progress of this sort can the stabilization of cur rencies and exchange on the gold standard or otherwise with or without redefinition of gold parities be achieved We may confidently ex pect the reduction in the number of countries which exhibit currency inflation and the narrow ing of the area over which instability of curren cies and exchanges has reigned but we should not expect any catastrophic substitution of normal currencies for abnormal Certain significant figures from the central bank and related statistics for the United States Great Britain France and Germany are shown in Chart 4 plotted on the logarithmic scale using the monthly figures relating to dates at or near the end of each month Supplementary data appear in our  Statistical Record I92I in the Federal Reserve Bulletin for February I9222 and in the Monthly Bulletin of Statistics published by the League of Nations United States Subject to seasonal influences affecting certain series at the end of the year the data for the federal reserve banks show a continu ation of tendencies which have been visible at least since late in I920 War paper the item of bills rediscounted on the security of liberty and victory loans or certificates of indebtedness has fallen from over I700 million dollars at the peak in May I9I9 to less than 300 millions in March I922 Other bills discounted have de clined since October I920 and total bills dis counted have fallen from their maximum of 280I millions that month to 6oo millions in March I922 Total earning assets which were over 3300 millions in November I92I are now around I200 millions of which United States bonds notes and certificates of indebtedness constitute practically half These declines indi cate the great decrease in pressure upon the federal reserve banks as liquidation has taken place Note circulation has declined steadily since the latter part of I920 from a maximum of 335I millions in October I920 to less than 2200 mil lions in March I922 a decrease of over 34 per cent Federal reserve bank notes in circulation still a relatively small item have declined still more Other paper currency however including government notes and national bank notes has somewhat increased during the same period so that the monetary circulation as a whole has declined much less than 34 per cent Net de posits in federal reserve banks have not materi ally declined Accessions to the federal reserve system have somewhat offset the decline of re serves attributable to decreased deposits in mem ber banks the principal cause of fluctuation has been variations in government deposits Mean while reserves have risen from some 2050 mil lions in March I920 to some 3100 millions in March I922 representing an increase of over a billion dollars in gold Statistics of reporting member banks in the federal reserve system 3 reveal not merely the continued decline in bills payable and bills re discounted with federal reserve banks since November I920 Commercial loans and loans se cured by government obligations also continue to decline but since August I92I other classes of loans and investments notably United

have been a by product of the recoinage of the British silver currency with lower silver content By con trast in I919 the reserves of the Bank of Eng land showed a net increase of I2 million pounds and in I920 one of 37 millions the latter due chiefly to the absorption of the reserves of the joint stock banks2 The Bank of England note issue remained fairly constant in I92I though tending slightly downward in the second half year The decrease of 6 million pounds during the year contrasts strikingly with the increase of 2I millions in I919 and 342 millions in I920 though the latter was due in large measure to the issue of notes to the joint stock banks in return for the gold which they gave up The note circu lation has further declined by 5 millions in the first two months of I92I The currency note circulation declined practically throughout the year I92I though showing the usual yearend expansion The notes outstanding at the end of I92I were 326 millions as compared with 356 millions at the end of I9I9 and 368 millions at the close of I920 Deposits with the Bank of England show an even more marked decrease from I919 and I920 season for season Deposits other than public which were i8o4 millions at the end of I919 and I752 at the end of I920 were but io6l at the end of I92I In these declines is reflected the liquidationwhich characterized I92I With stationary reserves and decreased liabil ities the central reserve ratio combining currency and bank figures has ranged during I92I from 27 to 29 per cent as compared with a range from 22 to 26 per cent during most of I920 and from I9 to 22 per cent in most of I919 When it is re membered that a corresponding ratio calculated for the end of I9I3 is about 35 per cent the ap proach to prewar reserve strength is impressive In part of course the currency contraction in I92I resulted simply from the severe business depression and it is not unlikely that the decline will be checked or interrupted as business im proves In part however the increase in re serves and decrease in liabilities results from a definite policy of currency restriction and oppor tunist increases in reserves This policy has been pursued against powerful opposition during I920 and I92I and it is unlikely to be abandoned unless the depression should be seriously pro longed It logical end is the accumulation of reserves and contraction in note and deposit liabilities to such a point that with trade con ditions in equilibrium specie payments may be resumed and Britain regain the gold standard The return to specie payments will normally be accompanied by a declining trend in commodity prices and a rise in sterling exchange though both movements are likely to be frequently ob scured by temporary movements in the opposite direction and the decline in commodity prices may be materially checked if American prices should rise appreciably The big five British joint stock banks have emerged creditably from an exceedingly trying year The large profits of I920 owing to huge loans at high rates were heavily cut into by allowances for depreciation in securities During I92I gross profits were much smaller because of reduced loans and lower money rates but the rise in giltedged investment securities made un necessary further allowances on this score and the banks were able to maintain their dividends even after absorbing losses on liquidation of loans and adding to reserves for further losses as well as to enter all their investments includ ing war loans purchased above even current market prices as  at or under market values 3 During I921 loans and advances fell from 767 million to 678 and acceptances from 79 millions to 54 Bills discounted increased by I28 millions but competent observers agree that this increase is explained by a dedine in commercial discounts much more than offset by increased holdings of treasury bills perhaps as much as I50 millions4 In other words the banks have absorbed treas ury bills and enabled their depositors to pur 1 As lately as March I4 however the Comptroller of the Currency told the House Ways and Means Committee that a  tremendous volume of pastdue paper

I France Liquidation in France is evidenced by the persistent decline of commercial bills from 3309 million francs at the end of I920 to 2506 millions at the end of I92i a decline of 25 per cent and in weeks unaffected by seasonal pres sure both late in I92I and early in I922 to less than 2300 millions The corresponding figure at the end of I9I3 was 1526 milions It is fur ther to be noted that bills matured but extended at the outbreak of war which at the end of I9I8 amounted to I029 millions were reduced by the end of I92I to 57 millions Advances on bullion and securities however have increased slightly over the year as a whole but in no such degree as was manifest in I919 and I920 when bills re ceivable were also increasing even more rapidly In the aggregate commercial bills and advances declined by nearly 8oo millions over I4 per cent during the year and private deposits shrank by approximately the same amount Both have declined further in I922 and are now lower than at any time since the close of the war The most impressive change in I92I has been the reduction in the advances to the state These stood at the maximum 26600 million francs during most of the last four months of I920 By the end of I92I they had been reduced by 2 billion francs in accordance with the con tract between the Bank and the state Since January i partly through the operation of a sinking fund to which the Bank credits interest payments in excess of a small figure which has yielded some I200 millions they have been re duced to as low as 22 billion francs Though variations in these advances during the year may be expected it appears probable that the gov ernment will be able to comply with its engage ment to reduce these advances by not less than 2 billion francs a year Partially offsetting this decline however is the steady increase through addition of interest charges in the treasury bills discounted for advances to foreign governments which now amount to over 4 million francs The note circulation declined in consequence of reductions in loans and advances by about Ii billion francs during I92i At the end of February I922 it stood at 36i31 million francs as compared with the peak of 39646 millions on November 6 I920 Further reductions in note circulation may be expected to accompany the repayment of advances by the state even though the portfolio of commercial bills expands with business improvement The reduction in the Banks advances to the state has been made possible not by a surplus of government revenues but by an increase in other classes of floating debt principally national de fense bills which increased by 23 billion francs during I92I to some 70 billions at its close It is sometimes stated that these national defense bills function as currency and therefore make for inflation as effectively as bank advances to the state This might conceivably occur either in substitution for cash or checks as Liberty bonds were used to a limited extent in the United States in I9I92I or as a basis for bank loans employed like the proceeds of any collateral loans The evidence is however that such uses are uncommon and negligible in amount A por tion of the bils are carried by the banks as in vestments A considerably smaller portion are held by business concerns as temporary invest ments of working capital These two items to gether probably do not exceed I5 or 20 billion francs out of the total issue The great bulk have been purchased and are held as invest ments by the French people who have absorbed them the more readily in a year when stocks were declining and bonds none too secure They are widely distributed In case of improvement in the security markets the government will doubtless issue a new consolidated loan which in part will operate to fund a part of thedefense bills and in part to limit the necessity of pressing the sale of new national defense bills Germany In Germany expansion continues in contrast to the contraction in other leading countries Of the Reichsbanks total assets at the end of I92I of I50 billion marks over I32 billions nearly 90 per cent consisted of dis counted treasury bills Other bills and checks amounted to the relatively insignificant figure of I062 millions Since May 1921 practically the entire increase in the floating debt has been added to the Reichsbanks portfolio of discounted treas ury bills whereas up to that time considerable amounts of the treasury bills were discounted I A W Kiddy Evening Post January 14 192272 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS outside the Reichsbank and the outside holdings not only were larger but increased at a more rapid rate than the Reichsbank holdings This is clear from Table 3 which shows quarterly figures since the war for these bills discounted Whereas in France and Italy contraction in advances to the state by the banks of issue have been made possible largely by the absorption of treasury bills or other shortterm paper by out side investors in Germany the cessation of this absorption has necessitated the ceaseless increase in advances to the state by the Reichsbank The inevitable consequence has been a vast increase both in notes and in private deposits Measures to restrict German currency inflation must not merely provide for larger government revenues but also at least for a considerable period must stimulate the absorption of government treasury bills or other loan paper by German investors The note circulation increased moderately during the first five months of I92I but very rapidly from May to December The net in crease in I92I as a whole was 45 billions as com pared with 33 millions in I920 but the rate of increase less than 70 per cent in I92I as com pared with over 90 per cent in I920 has been smaller This is revealed on the chart by the more moderate ascent of the curve in I92I This relative decline is the more noteworthy since the war loan bank notes decreased during I92I by 3708 millions so that the total note circulation as the chart indicates increased more slowly than that of the Reichsbank2 It is significant that the private deposits at the end of I92I some 253I4 million marks were nearly 25 times the commercial bills This indicates the extent to which the great banks obtain their credits at the Reichsbank mainly not by the rediscount of private bills but by the sale of treasury bills The decline in the Reichsbank gold reserve through export for reparation purposes is com mented upon elsewhere The reserve though still large is relatively insignificant only 07 per cent of note and deposit liabilities at the end of I92I and its present importance in the German monetary system is purely psycho logical Italy In Italy note circulation decreased pretty steadily throughout I92I save for a temporary increase in September and October until the banking crisis and seasonal require ments at the end of the year raised the issue to a point not far below that of the year before No new longterm loans have been issued but thanks to the depression and declining stock market the government has been able to borrow on shortterm treasury bills sufficiently to cover its current deficits and to repay over 24 billion lire to the banks of issue Note circulation on commercial account as contrasted with issues for account of the state continued to increase up to September though more slowly in I92I than in I920 when state circulation was also in creasing and less considerably than the state circulation declined Total circulation declined from I973I million lire at the end of I920 to I7920 million lire at the end of November I92I TABLE 3GERMAN TREASURY BILLS OUTSTANDING I9I82I  billion marks Date Held by Held Toa Reichsbank outside Total Reichisbank rgi8 December 31

from Wirt schaft und Statistik Complete data unavailable from September 1920 to April I92I inclusive I Undoubtedly a large part of the savings which might have been so invested have been sent abroad in various forms and into various countries large amounts into Switzerland Hol land and Sweden The difficulties of the German government in complying with the reparation terms are unquestionably due to a considerable extent to its failure to divert these funds to the Allies 2 Owing to the retirement and cancellation of large quanti ties of war loan bank notes the Reichsbanks own holdings of these shrank during I921 from 234I7 millions to 6964 millionsDEVELOPMENTS IN WORLD FINANCE 73 the lowest figure since July I920 Meanwhile state currency notes have remained stationary at 2270 million lire of 5 and iolire notes and 276 millions in smaller bills Loans and discounts of the leading private banks continued to increase up to the end of September and deposits up to the end of Octo ber Since then the situation is difficult to follow because of the serious embarrassment of the Banco Italiana di Sconto which failed near the end of the year The crisis which this failure precipitated was mitigated by the declaration of a moratorium for a year and by the support given by the other banks As in the case of Japan the basic cause was unsound banking practices notably tying up funds in essentially capital advances but the abnormal variations in prices and exchange and the effect of the de pression upon shipping iron and steel and other industries were important contributing factors The liquidation and reorganization of the bank appear to be progressing in orderly fashion Other countries Comparative statements of the Bank of Belgium show no appreciable change in its gold holdings but a 50 per cent increase in its silver reserve which now stands at 40o million francs Foreign bills and deposits continued to shrirnk and amounted to only 2 Imillions as com pared with I67 millions at the end of I9I3 Bills discounted are 426 millions very much smaller than in I920 or even I9I3 though somewhat larger than in I9I9 the decline reflects the business depression Public securities and in vestment of surplus are slightly larger loans se cured by foreign credits slightly smaller than a year ago The outstanding asset items are 480 nillions of provincial bonds and 5500 millions of advances to the government for the retirement of German marks deposited with the bank These two items constitute 6 of the banks assets neither decreased during I92I Note circulation which increased greatly in I9I9 and I920 has risen very little in I92I while private deposits are less than half the amount of a year ago and less than onefourth the amount at the end of I9I9 Here as in France and Italy the contrac tion of circulation depends largely upon the reduction in the advances made to the state in which no progress can yet be reported Netherlands Bank statements show a decline of 30 million florins 5 per cent in its gold reserve and I3 millions reduction in its silver Foreign bills too are much lower than at the end of I920 34 millions as compared with 53 Loans and dis counts are nearly 40 per cent larger than last year 270 millions but advances have fallen in greater degree to 5o per cent of last years amount The two items together have de creased from 444 millions to 395 Note circula tion is slightly over one billion florins deposits have shrunk markedly and both are now lower than since I9I7 Liquidation and currency con traction of moderate degree therefore charac terized I92I The present strength of the reserve is indicated by the ratio of 588 per cent of metallic reserve to notes and deposits combined while advances to the state are negligible in amount The Bank of Spain shows an increase of 56 million pesetas in gold making a total gold reserve of 25I3 millions the largest ever held Silver holdings which declined between I9I5 and I920 have risen by 52 millions to 625 mil lions Loans and discounts have increased by 957 millions practically 5o per cent signifi cantly government deposits have increased nearly by the same amount Note circulation and private deposits have both somewhat de clined The ratio of metallic reserves to note and deposit liabilities combined though smaller than in recent years stands at practically 5o per cent Statements of the Swiss National Bank show a slight increase in gold reserves chiefly in De cember I92I and erratic fluctuations in silver holdings Discounts and advances were on the whole lower in I920 than in I919 and somewhat lower still in I92i but the note circulation has been only slightly lower The reserve ratio remains high around 6o per cent In Sweden a slight decrease in gold reserves has been more than offset by increases in foreign bills and balances abroad Note circula tion has contracted materially Discounts and loans and deposits have greatly declined until the end of the year but the yearend figures are higher than at the close of I919 and I920 In Denmark and Norway on the other hand foreign bills and balances have declined and while the note circulation has declined slightly both discounts and loans and deposits increased during the year74 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS The Bank of CzechoSlovakia has restrained the increase in its note issue to moderate dimen sions Semiannual figures from June 30 1920 run as follows 8729 II288 iii68 I2I30 all in million kroner Thus the net increase in i8 months has been nearly 40 per cent The bulk of this increase however occurred in I920 during 1921 the net increase was only 8 per cent Deposits however have also increased in some what larger proportion The Bank of Finland has improved its condi tion in I92I While gold holdings remain un changed at 42 million finmarks balances abroad and foreign bills have increased fairly consistently since September 1920 and in the latter half of I92I averaged around 400 millions Holdings of government securities Finnish and foreign have declined from II12 millions at the end of March 1921 nearly the maximum reached in I920 to under goo millions in the later months of 1921 Owing to improvements in the govern mental position private loans and discounts could expand  indeed they have risen during the year from 255 millions to 657 millions  while the note circulation has tended downward since March I92I and in the later months has been much the same as in the latter part of 1920 The check to inflation is clearly evident In Roumania the note issue has expanded under the influence of marked increases in ad vances to the state only partially offset by de clines in other advances In JugoSlavia the new national bank note issue has expanded even faster than the increase in government advances owing to the increase in commercial biDs The same is true in Poland where the note issue rose from 5o billion marks to 230 during I92I as government advances rose from 6o billions to 221 and private loans and discounts from 41 billions to 34a deposit accounts rising at the same time from 14 billions to 49 In Austria the inflation has been similar and for the same rea sons while in Hungary it has been somewhat less extreme III GOLD RESERVES AND GOLD MOVEMENTS A conEspicuous event of the year 1921 was the remarkable flow of gold to the United States which has been continuous since September I9201 This movement is illustrated by Chart 5 showing monthly data of gold imports and ex ports since the beginning of I919 In the year 192I the net imports amounted to 667 million dollars Net imports from September I920 to January I922 have amounted to nearly goo mil ions Owing to this tremendous influx and the absorption of the product of American gold mines the gold stock of the United States i creased from less than 2700 milhon dollrs in the first half of 1920 to nearly 37oo mlons early In 1922 The great bulk of this gold has come not from central bank gold reserves but from new pro duction which amounted iM 1921 to about 321 million dollars and from Russian hoards seep mg through Sweden Switzerland France and other countries either as Russian gold or its eq  Indeed the stability of the central gold reserves has been quite striking In the last half of 192 the Reichsbank yielded on reparation accoun nearly xtoo millfion marks 1o per cent of its holdings Last spring the Netherlands Bank released 30 milion guilders 5 per cent of its reserve and late in 1921 the Swedish Rlkshank released IO million kroner order to replenish depleted foreign balances CHART 5 UNITED STATES GOLD IMPORTS AND EXPORTS MONTLY FROM OCTOBER I9I8 20 0 0o5 40 40 30 30 20 2 400 o 102 448 tgS 40 4  I 7C5  I I  6 r             7 this RvEV1w Sptember ig92n pp 319 32o

creased its gold holdings during I92I by 56 million pesetas Some of the newer nations notably Poland CzechoSlovakia and Jugo Slavia have begun to accumulate appreciable gold holdings which have increased more or less steadily since some time in I9201 The amounts however are still quite small and insignificant in comparison with the volume of currency out standing Minor increases also have taken place in the reserves of the Banks of France and Switz erland The more striking increases in Japan receive special comment below Upon the whole then the worlds central re serves have not materially changed during I92I either in aggregate amount or in distribution outside of America and Japan In these two countries and the European neutrals the reserve ratios are high generally elsewhere except in Great Britain they are extremely low because of the tremendous expansion in notes and deposits Almost universally the reserves are impounded for future use they are not at present function ing as reserves Few governments feel able to afford to lock up further funds in order to in crease them but few are willing to see them ma terially reduced Moreover no changes in gold policies have yet taken place2 Gold movements remain subject to serious restrictions Japan and the late neu trals still in the throes of industrial depression are unready to venture upon the bold policy of resuming gold redemption and stabilizing their exchanges Even in countries financially strong stabilization of exchange can hardly be counted upon in time to contribute to industrial recovery but promises rather to be accomplished in the course of that recovery or subsequently It is sometimes asserted or implied that Americas absorption of gold in the past two years has been to Europes detriment This is far from the truth Our free gold market has helped to keep umines in operation which an em bargo would have shut down adding to indus trial maladjustments The bulk of the rest has come from sources where it served merely as a rainy day fund which has now been employed in purchasing goods needed in the emergency It has been so used when its purchasing power over goods was higher than for years perhaps also higher than it may be in years to come European central banks cannot afford to buy much of it at a premium and can expect to ab sorb little of it without paying a premium while their currencies are so greatly depreciated We have actually benefited Europe by purchasing quantities of a liquid asset at good rates when no other large markets for the commodity were available From a narrowly selfish standpoint perhaps we have been foolish to accept all this gold We do not need it either for circulation or for bank reserves We are not using it it is merely piling up in the federal reserve banks By tempting to unhealthy expansion of currency and credit it threatens to do us actual harm and only time will show whether we are wise enough and strong enough to meet this danger successfully On the other hand since we can afford the luxury of a huge gold hoard there is much to be said for maintaining an important monetary policy such as that of free trade in gold and free coinage of gold even in the face of movements which are temporarily not to our advantage Americas huge and increasing gold reserves constitute a national problem of international importance Thanks to restrictions upon gold circulation and to the law requiring member banks to count as reserve only their deposits with federal reserve banks most of the gold is now held by the treasury and federal reserve banks The latter holdings constitute nearly 8o per cent of the entire note and deposit liabil ities of these banks as against a legal require ment of less than 40 The increase in this ratio contrasted with the more moderate increase in British central reserve ratio the stationary French ratio and the declining German ratio is shown in Chart 6 Allowing for the legal minimum reserve against deposits the reserve against federal reserve notes is well over ioo per cent The margin is extraordinarily large even for the present stage in the business cycle when reserve ratios are normally at a maximum when frozen loans have been liquidated in large measure and new borrowings are yet small There is no prospect that we can advanta geously employ these reserves in our domestic business To encourage credit expansion suffi ciently to reduce reserve ratios to more normal 1 Monthly Bulletin of Statistics 2 See however below pp 7678THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS proportions would lead to a most dangerous gold inflation The prospects are slight that foreign countries will in the near future be able to reverse the process which is leading to a net import and draw gold from us in the ordinary course of trade and finance even though we invest heavily abroad The time is coming however when the reestablishment of the gold standard abroad in one country after another can be greatly facilitated by a proper utilization of portions of this gold which we can easily spare at negligible cost to ourselves and to our ad vantage as well as to that of foreign countries Whether this can best be done by establishing an international bank or a gold exchange pool or by utterly different methods and how to judge when the time is ripe for such a move  these are matters which merit thorough study on the part of American banking leaders and the Treasury The recent slackening of gold imports into the United States is attributable partly to seasonal influences but more largely to large decreases in our excess of exports over imports which is more than a seasonal movement and to heavy out ward invisible movements of funds into foreign investments or balances abroad The Japanese specie position like the Ameri can is of more than national importance Here the significant figures are those of the socalled specie reserves reported twice a month by the Minister of Finance These consist in part of gold and silver held in Japan by the Bank of Japan and of deposits and giltedged securities abroad chiefly in London and New York Quarterly figures from the end of I9I8 are shown in Table 4 These reserves steadily increased to a maxi muM of 2I83 million yen at the close of I920 Since February I92I however they have de clined slowly reaching a figure of 2092 millions at the end of I92I This decline is undoubtedly attributable to the continued excess of merchan dise imports inadequately offset by earnings of Japanese shipping and foreign investments or by new investments abroad They would have un doubtedly decreased further had not the govern ment restricted specie exports when the tendency to export appeared early in I92I but this policy was adopted and is maintained even at the ex pense of the depreciation of the yen in New York which has continued throughout I92I The policy appears inexcusable when the re serve position is so strong that during most of I92I the note issue was more than covered by specie and the ratio of metallic reserves to the sum of notes and deposits largely government deposits has been well over 50 per cent CiART 6 FOUR

the close of I92I Thanks to this policy a large excess of merchan dise imports has not prevented the importation of specie Trade reports show huge specie im ports in the second half of I920 and continuing imports though at a rapidly diminishing rate through I92I offset to a very slight degree by exports of 5 millions in I9I9 and 4 millions in I920 The total imports reached 403 millions in I920 and I37 millions in I92I The great bulk of these consisted of gold silver imports were important only in the last quarter of I920 when they amounted to 77 million yen Thus the specie reserves held in Japan increased by 405 millions in I920 and II9 millions in I92I reach ing a maximum of I227 millions at the end of November I92I If Japan persists in restricting specie exports we cannot be surprised at the further deprecia tion of her exchange further expansion of her currency and a continued discrepancy between Japanese prices and world prices  movements which have been especially in evidence in the later months of I92I On the other hand a sound gold policy will call for restoring and maintaining parity of exchange even at the ex pense of gold exports and a reduction in the needlessly large reserve It will imply foreign lending by Japanese restriction of currency ex pansion and a renewed downward readjustment of Japanese prices Despite the temporary in conveniences of such a policy Japan is likely thereby to hasten her own recovery of normal domestic business and foreign trade as well as to contribute of her strength to the recovery abroad Persistence in the restrictive policy may lead to a domestic revival on an unsound basis for which there is no real excuse It is at last possible to record positive prog ress toward the restoration of the gold standard abroad It will be recalled that many of the neutrals notably Holland Sweden Switzerland and Spain as well as Canada the United King dom and Japan have possessed relatively large specie reserves and that in general these coun tries have contemplated and in some instances formally announced their intention of restoring the gold standard at old parities as soon as prac ticable The recent progress has been facilitated by the approach to stability of gold prices in the United States the contraction of currencies in most countries outside of central and eastern Europe the decline of price levels in these coun tries toward the level prevailing in the United States the approach to equilibrium in trade balances and partly in consequence of these factors the rise in foreign exchange rates in New York as well as by the increasing recog nition in America that much of our huge gold reserves can be safely used only to assist in the rehabilitation of foreign currencies Since De cember 9 Swiss exchange has been at or above par and Switzerland is again effectively if not necessarily permanently upon the gold standard Swedish Dutch Canadian and Japanese ex change all stand above 95 per cent of gold parity and sterling has recovered to over 90 per cent of that parity There are various possible methods by which the gold standard may be restored One is to abolish forthwith the restrictions on gold move ments and to resume specie payment for notes  either waiting until economic forces have brought exchange on New York to parity or to anticipate somewhat this achievement This method while fraught with some inconvenience if not with danger would be possible for countries with huge gold reserves such as Japan or Spain and with reasonable precautionary measures includ ing the establishment of reserves in America for several other countries Another possible method is to reach an inter national agreement whereby several nations would decide upon a common policy and take the necessary precautionary measures in com mon possibly with the assurance of assistance from America If it were not for the notorious difficulty in arriving at international agreement this method would doubtless be the best to pur sue If adopted even in part it may hasten the extension of the gold standard and widen the area of stable exchanges but it is not likely to be the initial step A third method capable of wider adoption has lately been suggested by a commission appointed to advise the Swedish government on measures for combating the trade depression This com mission reported in February proposals looking toward the restoration of the gold standard The78 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS economist Professor Hechscher urged an im mediate return to a full gold standard The

February the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the in tention of the government to permit the re establishment of an unrestricted market for gold in London at the earliest date at which the state of the exchange renders this course possible and desirable 2 The world output of new gold continues to decline partly because of the loss of most of Russian output partly because of increasing dif ficulties of mining in many fields but predomi nantly because the decreased purchasing power of gold over commodities reflected in the 50 per cent increase of American prices over the I9I3 level renders unprofitable mining operations in mines which at prewar price levels could be ad vantageously worked This decline in the out put is of present importance only to the gold mining industry its owners and the countries in which it constitutes a leading industry Whatever may be the future effect of a con tinued decline it cannot be regarded as a factor retarding the restoration of the gold standard or indeed as a factor materially affecting current price levels The gold at present in the worlds central reserves properly distributed and con trolled with a measure of equilibrium restored in industry and public finance will be adequate to maintain the gold standard in every country And the question of the level of commodity prices which will be reached within the next decade depends more largely upon the reientry of gold into circulation and upon the develop ment of banking methods than upon the output of new gold IV COMMODITY PRICES AND BUSI NESS FAILURES Since April I92I the general level of prices in the United States has been fairly stationary The Bureau of Labor Statistics index has varied between I54 and I48 per cent of the I9I3 level the Federal Reserve Board index from I43 to I48 per cent3 At no period since I914 has such stability persisted for as long a period as the past ten months when the variations have been little greater than were experienced before the war Fluctuations in prices of individual commodities and various groups have been rather greater than in normal times but have pretty much offset one another in any large grouping Too much emphasis can be laid upon this fact numerous adjustments of prices of particular commodities are still occurring and it is quite too early to speak of the present level as a stabil ized or normal postwar level Ordinarily busi ness recovery is accompanied by rising prices and the present level even if normal for a period of depression may be below the level around which prices would tend to fluctuate in the vari ous stages of activity and stagnation Nevertheless the major adjustments appear to have been made and provided a new era of gold inflation is avoided there is reason to hope that the violent fluctuations in gold prices and the value of gold are definitely behind us Abroad price movements have been dissimi lar4 The movements in both wholesale and retail prices abroad are illustrated in

rates of rise and fall shown by the different curves regardless of the level In India as in America the price level has been fairly stable at a level about i8o per cent of I9I3 prices In France the average level has fluctuated within a comparatively narrow range since May I92I Since August it has steadily declined and latterly has been lower than since the middle of I9I8 In Italy an upward move ment in the third quarter of I92I raised the average to about six times the I9I3 average and no marked changes have since taken place At this level Italian prices are only about io per cent below the peak reached in April and again in November I920 and 20 per cent higher than the point reached after a decline of seven months in June I92I In Great Britain Holland Switzerland Scan dinavian countries Canada and Australia the decline in price levels was resumed in the third or fourth quarters of I92I after a few months of moderate changes In most of these cases the average price level shows an increase over I913 of not more than io or I5 per cent greater than does the American price level and in the case of Australia and the United Kingdom the difference is smaller still In Japan the price level rose considerably be tween April and October but has since fallen somewhat nevertheless the present level stands more than twice the I9I3 average representing a much greater increase than is true of most countries except where inflation has been ex treme save only Norway France and Italy The height of this price level coupled with the current rate of exchange would appear to consti tute a strong stimulus to Japaneseimports and a factor retarding Japanese exports and to strengthen the forces making for gold exports from Japan In Germany where prices were falling in the first five months of I92I they have since risen by leaps and bounds with special rapidity in November and December Indeed between May and DecemberI92I two indexes agree that German wholesale prices increased from 24 to 2g times Here unquestionably currency inflation 1 See fuller statement in this REvIEw September 1921 p 32280 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS CHART 7 WHOLESALE PRICES IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES I9I822 AS

policy of currency inflation the upward price revolution is still in progress Upon the whole the movements of price index numbers in I92I particularly in recent months show an encouraging approach toward a common international level For the present prices in terms of gold seem to have touched bottom and prices in paper currencies in the British Empire and in Europe outside the inflationist countries are tending toward the same level Considering the progress already made the distance to a sub stantial accord among these price levels is now relatively slight in Great Britain Holland Sweden Switzerland In these countries there is prospect of comparatively early reestablish ment of the gold standard and gold prices The declines have certainly been hastened by con traction of currency and credit and also by the reduced demand characteristic of the business depression but the depression will have yielded excellent fruit if it is followed by a readjustment of price levels among several important coun tries On the other hand the renewal of marked inflation in Germany and its continuance else where in central Europe indicate the persistence of serious currency disorders and price variations which must retard economic progress and present a difficult problem for the future In Japan too prices have risen rather than declined and are farther from a world level than a year ago It will be noted that retail prices in the various countries show much less violent movements but that these too display much the same trends as wholesale prices They have tended toward a common international level and as a detailed examination makes clear have come more and more into adjustment with wholesale prices The prospects for price movements in the next year as for the past must be considered country by country It may be said that revival of busi ness will make for rising prices but that price readjustments toward the world level will gen erally make for falling prices There is certainly a prospect of more moderate fluctuations than characterized most of I920 and the first part of I02I but it is too early to applv any such com ment to Italy Germany Poland Austria and other inflating countries In America and in most of the sounder coun tries abroad the banking community is aware of the dangers of undue expansion of credit and currency even upon a gold basis and the effec tive resistance in recent months to proposals looking toward such expansion by artificial meas ures argues well for sane policies in the coming year Moreover the pressure from farming business interests has already somewhat dimin ished as farm prices have risen and a beginning in business recovery has appeared Nevertheless there are still insidious dangers of fresh inflation In particular the soldiers bonus unless financed by additional taxation promises to lead to an abnormal stimulus to demand and an increase in credit and currency even if the cash bonus is largely replaced by a certificate bonus The problem of reconciling the tremendous decline in commodity prices with the far more moderate decline in currency and bank loans in a period of reduced volume of industry and trade continues to attract attention of economists and analytical bankers Professor Cassel has empha sized the factor of hoarding Mr McKenna in his annual address to the stockholders of the London Joint City and Midland Bank estimates that in Great Britain the velocity of circulation of money including deposit currency declined in I92I by 40 per cent as compared with I920 In the United States a different theoretical prob lem now presents itself how to reconcile stability of the price level with continued contraction of currency and credit synchronous with a moderate increase in business activity It seems clear that quantity theorists who desire to apply the theory to shorttime movements must consider much more carefully the questions of velocity of circu lation of money credit and goods as well as the applicability of existing index numbers in testing such a theory Naturally the continuance of price declines has been accompanied by heavy business fail ures In all countries for which statistics are available including Germany these were far greater in 192 I than in I920 higher even than in the fourth quarter of I920 and upon a high level throughout the year Except in Germany and Great Britain the number of failures in I92I ex ceeded the number of I9I3 Compared with that 1 See Monthly Bulletins of Statistics and our Current Statis tics Statistical Data I92I Supplement April I922 Part VI Table 8DEVELOPMENTS IN WORLD FINANCE 83 base they were especially severe in Norway which has been hard hit by stagnation in shipping and by insurance failures In Germany the in crease represents a partial return to freer condi tions of business activity as contrasted with the protection accorded against failure during and since the war The tremendous increase from I919 and I920 does not indicate worse business conditions nor will further increases be disquiet ing In general the failures are not unusually large for a period of business depression If prices abroad decline further and if the re covery from the business depression is slow as seems now in prospect we may expect a slow decline in business failures but in most coun tries for which statistics are available they are likely to be lower in I922 than in I92I and lower in later quarters than in the first V FOREIGN EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS The movement of the foreign exchanges since the armistice challenges the best of analysis In normal times the subject is of endless complex ity intimes of dislocatedexchanges with world currencies tied to no common mooring it is baf fling in the extreme Established facts assumed facts and prospects differently interpreted all influence the course of exchange Large inter national financial payments often unrelated to trade movements figure invisibly The move ments have been especially complicated by the activity of considerable speculative interests unable to gauge accurately the relative weight of different influences unaccustomed to deal with the situation and moved alternately by immoderate enthusiasm and excessive pessimism One who examines the course of exchanges during the past three years is forced to the con clusion that the influences at work have been poorly gauged and that this inaccurate gauging has been a significant factor in the instability of the exchanges The correction is a double one first the nature of the operation of the funda mental forces at work must be understood and second the evidence regarding these forces must be made more completely available The stabil ization of foreign exchange rates which depends fundamentally upon the restoration of economic equilibrium and sound currencies can be pro moted by efforts leading to a better understand ing of the theory of foreign exchange the wider extension of this knowledge and a truer appre ciation of actual economic and financial develop ments abroad as well as at home A careful statistical analysis of foreign ex change rates should answer two questionsb re garding the rates of each country i Is the exchange tending up or down 2 Are the fluc tuations from the trend becoming more or less pronounced With these questions answered one is in a position to examine into three groups of related problems i How are we to account for the tendencies to rise or decline How far are these tendencies the reflection of domestic monetary influences in the country concerned how far to domestic conditions of production and trade how far to changes in the value of gold in terms of money in the United States a gold standard country 2 How are we to account for the major fluctuations from the trend in each coun try the similarity in these fluctuations from coun try to country and the significant variations How far are these due to seasonal influences how far the reflection of actual improvement or retrogression how far due to unbridled enthusiasm or panic on the part of speculative interests 3 What measures can wisely be taken toward modifying exchange fluctuations or reducing them to negligible proportions What will be the effect of measures proposed to this end How far can the evil of exchange in stability be corrected at once and to what extent must it be the goal of a long process No adequate answer to these questions can be attempted here but some discussion is called for not only by the importance of exchange move ments in world financial problems and by the significant developments which have recently transpired but by the very common misappre hension of the significance of foreign exchange rates as economic or financial barometers Any such discussion naturally proceeds from the exchange rates quoted at a single center For this purpose New York rates are most serv iceable since these rates at least after June I919 represent exchange upon the only country maintaining a full gold standard Moreover the movements must be considered country by country Inportant similarities in deed appear both in the shorttime movementsTHE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS and in the more basic trends But the differ ences are not less significant than the similarities and any average of the foreign exchange rates on several countries suffers by submerging notable differences without emphasizing the similarities which appear if one compares the separate move ments One might better ascertain for each rate a I2months moving average A compari son of these moving averages for several coun tries and a second comparison of the series of deviations from the moving averages would be most illuminating Without going so far as this however an illuminating comparison is furnished by logarithmic curves plotted on identical scales of the monthly average New York rates of ex change on leading foreign countries2 arranged in more or less natural groups These are shown in Chart 9 Any foreign exchange rate in New York at any one time is the gold dollar price of bills of exchange payable in the foreign currency con cerned Like other market prices it is deter mined by the volume of demand for such bills compared with the supply offered The supply arises from those individuals or organizations who have payments due from the country con cerned whether for imports into that country interest payments by that country repayments of bank balances or loans in that country and so on The demand arises from those who have payments to make to that country for its exports for new loans investments or temporary balances for tourist expenditures or immigrant remittances or otherwise Whatever increases any of the factors in demand tends to raise the rate whatever in creases any of the factors in the supply tends to lower it and vice versa All this is commonplace yet it is the starting point from which the influ ences operating upon exchange rates must be considered This trend of New York exchange on the late belligerents of Europe was continuously down ward from early in I9I9 until near the end of I920 In this decline three influences predomi nated i The withdrawal of United States treasury credits made impossible the continued pegging of exchanges Thus European countries were forced to obtain as best they could the funds to finance their purchases in the countries exporting food and raw materials Exchanges which had been maintained abnormally high therefore sought lower levels reflecting more or less accurately the difference in domestic price levels between the United States and the several countries A force tending to check but inade quate to prevent the decline was the tremendous extension of credit to European buyers by American exporters bankers and speculators which resulted in the accumulation of a mass of unfunded credits estimated to exceed 3 billion dollars 2 Government deficits and consequent currency inflation continued in a marked degree during I919 and in more moderate degree during I920 in most European countries Thus a larger amount of foreign currencies was offered for a given amount in dollars or dollar commodities leading to an increase in the relative value of the dollar and conversely a decline in the relative values of foreign currencies 3 American prices declined rapidly in the last eight months of I920 while foreign prices fell more slowly if at all Though in part this may have been an effect of the decline in exchange rates it is rea sonable to estimate that domestic factors were a weightier influence and that the divergence affected the exchange rates by stimulating for eign purchases in America and checking Ameri can purchases abroad The declines in the exchanges of the European belligerents were followed after an interval of shorter or longer duration by similar declines in the exchanges of the late neutrals Here the causes were largely the huge increase in imports of goods in which shortages had existed during the war either for domestic use or for reexport to the late belligerents unbalanced by increases in exports or in the case of South American countries and Japan by the heavy decline in exports unbalanced by declining imports The tendency to decline was more or less delayed for several countries by the possession of large bal ances accumulated in the United States during the war which were largely exhausted before the decline could begin Since late in I920 the trends have been more diverse In the case of exchanges on Canada 1 Compare a note by the present writer on Index Num bers of Foreign Exchange to appear in the Quarterly Journal of Economics May I922 2 These averages have been prepared by the

leading South American countries apparently show an upward turn in the trend in the middle of 1921 instead of late in I920 Exchanges on Germany and most eastern European countries where pronounced currency inflation has continued have shown a continued declining trend Exchange on Japan which has deviated only slightly from parity shows a downward trend since the xiiiddle of 192086 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS Several factors account for these differences in trend The upward tendency where it appears is generally due to the checking of currency in flation the passing of the emergency or specu lative demand for goods certain increases in exports as productive capacity improved and the resulting approach to equilibrium in interna tional trade The improvement has been assisted by the drift of German funds to various neutral centers such as Switzerland Holland and Swe den by the building up of other foreign balances in London Paris and elsewhere in anticipation of further economic improvement there and in reaction from the comparative illsuccess of American ventures in international banking and latterly especially by increased American investments in European and South American securities either in new issues or in far greater degree in established issues quoted abroad In the case of Great Britain an important support ing influence has been the improvement in the national credit in recognition of her achieve ment in balancing her budget in spite of the de pression the reduction in her foreign debt and her steps toward making payments in her huge debt to the United States government Increased tourist travel abroad and heavy re mittances from foreigners in America have con tributed much in certain instances toward recovery or to check declines The decline in the case of Germany is due essentially to the pressure for reparation pay ments under the terms agreed in May I92I coupled with the inability of the German gov ernment to marshal German resources for pay ment The check to the decline in I920 iS to be attributed largely to foreign speculative pur chases of marks and the resale of many of these doubtless made more precipitate the fall in the second half of I92I The increase in Ger man balances abroad has evidently continued in part this is a normal movement in conjunction with the restoration of German trade but to a large degree it represents the escape of German resources from the control of the German gov ernment and the burden of German taxation The decline in exchanges in most other eastern European countries reflects mainly the continu ajnce of unbalanced finances trade and curren cies which the improvement in production and export has not yet been sufficient to counteract and for which the supply of emergency credits has generally diminished In Japan the decline is essentially due to incomplete readjustments in the business depression coupled with an over cautious gold policy While there are thus certain common features of the movements since the armistice one must study the exchanges in individual countries in order to distingtuish differences of trend and sig nificant differences in movements Thus while French Belgian and Italian exchanges show much the same high points and low points and all have on the whole tended upwards since late in I920 French exchange has gained in I92I over Belgian which was higher until July I92I and Italian exchange has sagged well below both These differences reflect principally the more rapid recovery of Belgium from the wars effects the greater injury Belgium sustained in the in dustrial reaction the lower recuperative strength of Italy and the contrast between the currency contraction in France the moderate expansion in Belgium and the delayed contraction in Italy Similarly while the Scandinavian exchanges show considerable similarity only in shorttime movements Swedish exchange fell decidedly the least shows a distinctly narrower range of fluctu ation and though recovering less than Danish exchange has approached nearest to parity Norwegian exchange reached its lowest point only late in I92I whereas both Swedish and Danish exchange tended upwards through I92I These differences doubtless reflect in part the greater influence of the shipping depression upon Norway the sounder financial situation in Den mark and Sweden and the greater diversity of economic activity in Sweden Such analysis of past movements country by country contributes much to illuminate current movements and future prospects The most notable shortterm movement during the past year was the distinct improvement in most European exchanges in the first five months followed by a severe reaction in the next five or six months Seasonal influences were a factor in these movements as reflected for example in American trade balances in this period The upswing in April and May in certain exchanges reflects also an amount of unwarranted optimism 1 See this REvEw April 1922 Statistical Record 192T Part V Table IDEVELOPMENTS IN WORLD FINANCE 87 over the settlement of the German reparation terms which the subsequent months proved at least premature The rise toward the end of I92I represents partly seasonal influences partly a reaction from the undue pessimism of the sum mer and partly to fresh hopes derived from the Washington Conference and the proposal of the Genoa Conference Unquestionably one large factor in the violence of these shorttime movements is the presence of mobile funds in the shape of bank balances bills of exchange and foreign currencies which move from one center to another in response to politi cal and economic events like the fall of a ministry or a national coal strike Whereas in normal times such operations probably tend on the whole to minLmize fluctuations in exchange in the past two years they have probably increased those fluctuations Under more settled condi tions these funds will resume their stabilizing influence as indeed they may have already re sumed it in recent months Unquestionably the diminution in these fluctuations will be im mensely furthered as by international confer ences or otherwise the differences over the German reparations are composed the general issue of intergovernmental debts are settled and the return to the gold standard is hastened The problem of stabilizing exchanges has at tracted considerable attention but led to no direct action Upon the whole the instability was less extreme in I92I than in I920 and still less than in I9I9 but it remains abnormally large and unquestionably adds to the friction and costs involved in international trade The Brussels Conference in I920 it will be recalled refused to recommend formal stabilization meas ures whether established by national action or by international agreement and indicated that the instability would disappear as national cur rencies were stabilized and international trade became better balanced This conclusion is today quite generally accepted More progress toward stabilization can now be discerned than has yet clearly taken effect As we have already stated the return to the gold standard is now measurably within reach of several countries notably Canada Japan Great Britain Sweden and Switzerland Even before the full gold standard has been regained by these countries the precautionary measures of build ing up reserves in the United States with or without the formal assistance of the American government or federal reserve board are likely to result in more moderate fluctuations in certain exchange rates This same policy is open to countries like France which see no immediate prospect of restoring the gold standard but which have regained some measure of economic equi librium The possession of what is to all intents and purposes idle gold in America Japan and some other holders of heavy reserves puts these countries in a position to support such policies at small cost The pressure of savings for profitable investment and the continuance of the business depression have contributed to develop a state of mind more favorable to investment in foreign securities and to other measures tending to improve foreign markets Undeniably international agreements even of limited scope might facilitate the restoration of the gold standard and meanwhile lead to reduc tions in instability of the exchanges The diffi culties of reaching such international agree ments however have not yet been surmounted in spite of prevalent complaints regarding insta bility of exchange It must not however be concluded that no stabilization is possible with out formal international arrangements Even if international agreements should be effected the stabilization of the exchanges like the return to the gold standard and the normalization of cur rencies is likely to be piecemeal and gradual rather than comprehensive and simultaneous The foregoing discussion of foreign exchange is necessarily incomplete and considerably lack ing in balance Its conclusions are designed to be suggestive and tentative rather than finaland convincing If it furnishes a point of departure for further study it may be more serviceable than if it could be regarded as the last word on the subject

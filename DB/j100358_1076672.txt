EDUCATION ASSOCIATION TOGETHER WITH ITS SIXTEEN AFFILIATED SOCIETIES MET IN RICH MOND VIRGINIA FEBRUARY 2328 THE MORE IMPORTANT AFFILIATED ORGANI ZATIONS ARE THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION THE NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF EDUCATION AND THE SOCIETY OF THE COLLEGE TEACHERS OF EDUCATION CONCERNING THE PHILADELPHIA MEETINGS OF I913 THE SCHOOL REVIEW COMMENTED UPON THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT OF THE DISCUSSIONS MARKING A GREAT ADVANCE UPON THE INFORMAL INSPIRATIONAL PROGRAMS OF A FEW YEARS AGO EDUCATIONAL PROCESSES AGENCIES PRODUCTS ARE BEING MEASURED ARE BEING STANDARDIZED WITH RECOGNIZED UNITS OF EXACT VALUATIONS IN RICHMOND THIS SPIRIT OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION WAS EVEN MORE MARKED HERE AND THERE AN ADDRESS OF THE OLDER TYPE WAS HEARD BUT THE AUDIENCES INVARIABLY EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF UNSUPPORTED OPINIONS AND ASSERTIONS THE PROFESSION IN THE FUTURE WILL LISTEN ONLY TO THE MAN WHO TALKS FROM FACTS TYPES OF LEADERSHIP IN THE MEETINGS OF THE DEPARTMENT TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF LEADERSHIP WERE MANIFEST DAVID SNEDDEN COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION OF MASSA CHUSETTS WAS THE MOST PROMINENT LEADER OF THAT SENTIMENT WHICH STANDS FOR THE EXTREME IN EDUCATIONAL INNOVATIONS HIS ADVOCACY OF A SEPARATE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION FOR VOCATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION HOW EVER DID NOT RECEIVE WARM APPROBATION FROM THE RANK AND FILE OF SUPER INTENDENTS IN THE FIELD THE OTHER TYPE OF LEADERSHIP VOICED VERY EFFECTIVELY ON ONE OCCASION BY WILLIAM C BAGLEY OF ILLINOIS WHILE ADMITTING THE IMPERATIVE NECESSITY OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION INSISTED THAT IT OUGHT TO BE INSTITUTED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM INSISTED ALSO THAT THE VOCATIONAL CAN BE ARTICULATED WITH THE CULTURAL UNDER THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AND VIGOROUSLY PROTESTED AGAINST ANY ATTEMPT TO BELITTLE THE PLACE OF LIBERAL STUDIES THIS POSITION MET WITH THE HEARTY APPROVAL OF A LARGE MAJORITY IN THE CONVENTION 262EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT THE COLLEGE TEACHERS OF EDUCATION THE SOCIETY OF THE COLLEGE TEACHERS OF EDUCATION LISTENED TO A REPORT ON THE RATING PLACING AND PROMOTION OF TEACHERS BY A COM MITTEE FRANK E THOMPSON UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO CHAIRMAN DATA BASED UPON CAREFUL INVESTIGATION DISCLOSE THE FOLLOWING FACTS TEACHERS ARE IN LARGE NUMBERS INEXPERIENCED YOUNG WOMEN THEIR PREPARATION IS INADEQUATE THEIR TENURE OF ONE POSITION IS VERY BRIEF UNDER THE PROMPT INGS OF BUREAUS THEY CHANGE VERY OFTEN USUALLY TO POSITIONS BUT LITTLE IF ANY BETTER THAN THE ONES THEY LEAVE LARGE NUMBERS OF MEN DESERT THE PROFESSION BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE HOPE OF PROMOTION PETTY GOSSIP IN SMALL TOWNS DRIVES MANY YOUNG WOMEN OUT OF THE PROFESSION AND FINALLY A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE BEGIN THEIR WORK IN CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY SUCCEED THE COMMITTEE ASSERTED THAT ONE HALF OF THE EFFORT OF TRAINING TEACHERS IS LOST IN BAD PLACING IN THE ORIGINAL POSITIONS THE SOCIETY RECOGNIZED THAT THE PROBLEM IS ONE OF THE MOST VITAL OF THE DAY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN SUPERVISION ADMINISTRATION COURSES OF STUDY IS THE INDIVIDUAL TEACHER IN HER CLASSROOM NO THEORIZ ING NO PRACTICAL EFFORTS FROM ABOVE WILL BE ABLE TO OFFSET INEFFICIENCY IN THE TEACHING FORCE UNDER THIS CONVICTION THE SOCIETY CONTINUED THE COMMITTEE ANOTHER YEAR ITS SPECIAL DUTY BEING TO SUGGEST REMEDIES FOR I THE POOR METHOD OF SECURING SCHOOLS FOR BEGINNING TEACHERS 2 THE POOR METHOD OF PROMOTING 3 WHAT WAS TERMED THE TEMPERAMENTAL WAY OF RATING TEACHERS HOPE FOR BETTER CONDITIONS IN THE FUTURE SEEMS TO LIE IN THE CLOSER STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS AS FITTED FOR SPECIAL POSITIONS IN THE ELIMINATION OF THE COMMERCIAL TEACHERS AGENCIES AND IN SUBSTITUTING FOR THEM STATE AGENCIES WHICH CAN COOPERATE IN A SENSIBLE AND SYMPA THETIC RELATIONSHIP RURAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION THE RADICAL CHANGES NECESSARY IN RURAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION WERE OUTLINED IN A JOINT PAPER BY ELLWOOD P CUBBERLEY OF LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY AND E C ELLIOTT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN IF OUR RURAL AND SMALL VILLAGE SCHOOLS ARE AGAIN TO OCCUPY A VITAL PLACE IN OUR NATIONAL LIFE AND MINISTER TO THE REAL NEEDS OF RURAL LIFE THEY MUST BE FUN DAMENTALLY REORGANIZED AND REDIRECTED MAKING OF THEM NEW RURAL INSTITUTIONS ADAPTED TO MODERN NEEDS THIS WILL INVOLVE A COUNTY UNIT OF ORGANIZATION ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCES THE ELECTION OF A LAY COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION ANALOGOUS TO A CITY BOARD OF EDUCATION TO SELECT THE EXPERTS AND TO DETERMINE THE LARGER QUESTIONS OF POLICY AND PROCEDURE THE SUBSTITUTION OF AN APPOINTED 263THE SCHOOL REVIEW FOR AN ELECTED SUPERINTENDENT AND THE REORGANIZATION OF THE COUNTY ADMINIS TRATIVE OFFICE ALONG THE LINES OF THE BEST CITY ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE A REDIRECTION OF THE INSTRUCTION TO MEET MODERN EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AND THE TRAINING OF A BODY OF TEACHERS FOR RURAL WORK WHO CAN AND WILL RENDER COM MUNITY AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL SERVICE SEX HYGIENE THE DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE WENT ON RECORD UPON THIS MOOTED ISSUE IN THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION RESOLVED THAT WE RECOGNIZE FULLY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROPER TEACHING OF SEX HYGIENE BUT THAT WE BELIEVE THE IDEAL PLACE FOR GIVING SUCH INSTRUCTION TO BE THE HOME THAT WE BELIEVE THE SCHOOL SHOULD BE WILLING AND ANXIOUS TO HELP THE HOME IN THIS MATTER AS BEST IT CAN IF INSTRUCTION IN SEX HYGIENE IS TO BE GIVEN IN SCHOOL BY TEACHERS SPECIALLY QUALIFIED FOR SUCH WORK THE ORIGINAL RESOLUTION FAVORED INSTRUCTION TO INDIVIDUALS NOT TO CLASSES MRS YOUNG SUPPORTED BY PRESIDENT PEARCE OF MILWAUKEE NORMAL CARRIED THE AMENDMENT WHICH LEAVES THE METHOD OF TEACHING TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES DR DEVINES ADDRESS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE ADDRESSES WAS PRESENTED BY EDWARD A DEVINE DIRECTOR OF THE NEW YORK SCHOOL OF PHILANTHROPY SPEAKING AT THE OPENING SESSION OF THE CONVENTION HE SAID IN PART IF WE AGREE THAT NEITHER PUBLIC RELIEF NOR VOLUNTARY CHARITY HOWEVER NECES SARY AND VALUABLE THEY ARE HAD ANY POTENCY IN ITSELF FOR THE ABOLITION OF POVERTY WE ARE DRIVEN A STEP FURTHER TO AN ANALYSIS OF ITS CAUSES TO THE DISCOVERY OF ITS TAP ROOT CAUSEIF WE CAN FIND THATIF THERE IS ANY SUCH THING  POVERTY IS DUE TO THE EXPLOITATION OF THE EXPLOITABLE THE UNDERPAY OF THOSE WHO CAN BE UNDERPAID THE OVERWORK OF THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SECURE LEISURE THE LACK OF PROTECTION OF THE SUBNORMAL THE CULTIVATION FOR COMMERCIAL PROFIT OF VICIOUS HABITS OF DEPRAVED APPETITES OF HUMAN WEAKNESSES THE PLAY OF UNRESTRAINED GREED UPON INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT HAVE RESISTING POWER AS INDIVIDUALS AND WHOSE COMBINED LATENT RESISTING POWER IN THE FORM OF SOCIAL CONTROL HAS NEVER BEEN BROUGHT INTO EFFECTIVE COUNTERPLAY THE SCHOOL ITSELF IS THE NATURAL ORGANIZER OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH IT IMPARTS OR RATHER THE IMPARTING OF KNOWLEDGE AND ITS APPLICATION TO SOCIAL ENDS SHOULD NOT BE TWO PROCESSES BUT ONE IF THE ORGANIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE FOR THE COM MON GOOD DOES NOT TAKE PLACE COINCIDENTALLY WITH ITS ACQUISITION IT DOES NOT TAKE PLACE AT ALL OR AT LEAST ONLY PAINFULLY AND AT EXCESSIVE COST THE ASSUMP TION OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR POVERTY DISEASE AND CRIME CLEARLY INVOLVES THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SCHOOL INTO THE FOREMOST INSTRUMENT OF SOCIAL ECONOMY THIS IS NOT MERELY TO TACK A NEW LABEL ON AN INSTITUTION ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY 264EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT BELABELED ON THE CONTRARY IT MEANS SOMETHING AND WHAT IT MEANS IS FIRST A DIFFERENT TRAINING OF TEACHERS SECOND A NEW CURRICULUM AND THIRD MORE VITAL AND DIVERSIFIED CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE ADULT COM MUNITY IT IS FORTUNATE THAT OUR GENERATION IS INCLINING TO FORMULATE THE TASK OF EDUCATION LARGELY IN ECONOMIC TERMS IN TERMS OF EARNING AND SPENDING OF PRO DUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND STANDARDS OF LIVING THOSE ARE NO IGNOBLE OR PURELY MATERIALISTIC TERMS IT IS A MISINTERPRETATION OF THIS TENDENCY TO SAY THAT IT IS FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF INDUSTRY THE DEMAND IS MADE NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF INDUSTRY BUT IN THE NAME AND IN THE INTERESTS OF EDUCATION IF WE CAN INCREASE BY 50 PER CENT THE EARNING CAPACITY OF THE BOY WHO ENTERS INDUSTRY WE SHALL MAKE HIM RELATIVELY INDE PENDENT OF HIS EMPLOYER IF HE BECOMES WORTH 9 A WEEK AT THE START INSTEAD OF 6TO INDUSTRY HE BECOMES BY THE SAME EDUCATIONAL PROCESS WORTH I2 A WEEK TO HIMSELF I AM FAR FROM SUGGESTING THAT EARNING CAPACITY AT THE MOMENT OF LEAVING SCHOOL IS THE ONLY OR EVEN THE BEST TEST OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SCHOOLS BUT IT IS A VERY DEFINITE TEST AND ONE FROM WHICH THE EXPONENTS OF MODERN IDEAS IN EDUCATION SHOULD NOT SHRINK MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIT TO DO THE WORK OF THE WORLD AND KEEN TO APPRECIATE IN DUE PROPORTIONS THE FRUITS OF INDUSTRY CAPABLE WORKERS AND DISCRIMINATING ULTIMATE CONSUMERS PRODUCERS OF WEALTHIE OF WELLBEING AND RATIONAL USERS OF WEALTHTHESE ARE THE GOAL OF EDUCATION AS THE SOCIAL ECONOMIST WOULD FORMULATE IT ASKING FROM THE SCHOOLS NOT EVERYTHING BUT A GENEROUS SLICE OF THAT LARGE EVERYTHING OF WHICH SOCIAL WELFARE CONSISTS SOCIETY OF COLLEGE TEACHERS OF EDUCATION ACCOUNT OF THE

DAY HAS THUS COME TO CHICAGO IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY IO PER CENT INCREASE IN SALARY GRANTED TO THE TEACHERS WHOSE WORK TIME IS THUS EXTENDED THIS PROPOSAL OF THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF EDUCATION WITH BUT TWO DISSENTING VOTES HOWEVER BY A TIE VOTE NINE TO NINE THE BOARD DEFEATED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A NEW COURSE IN THE 268EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THIS COURSE HAD BEEN PREPARED BY MRS YOUNG THE DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THE REASON GIVEN FOR THE ACTION OF THE BOARD IS THAT THE PRO POSED COURSE HAS TOO MANY FADS AND FANCIES ONE MEMBER DECLARING I DONT BELIEVE IN SACRIFICING READING WRITING AND ARITHMETIC FOR BEAD WORKING AND SEWING THIS CRITICISM APPEARS TO BE ENTIRELY UNJUST MRS YOUNG IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID THE FIGHT IS AGAINST ME NOT AGAINST THE COURSE OF STUDY THE SCHOOLS OF CHICAGO ARE TO BE CON GRATULATED THAT THE BOARD OF EDUCATION REVISED ITS ILLCONSIDERED ACTION AND BY A VOTE OF 14 TO 2 ADOPTED THE ENTIRE PROGRAM FOR THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS MEANWHILE IT MAY BE NOTED THAT THE INFERIOR COURT HAS DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE OUSTED MEMBERS OF THE BOARD IN THE QUO WARRANTO PROCEED INGS JUDGE FOELL ASSERTS THAT THE MAYOR IN ACCEPTING RESIGNATIONS FROM THE TRUSTEES AT THE TIME OF THEIR APPOINTMENT WAS ACTING AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AND IN EFFECT DEPRIVING THEM OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION CONTEMPLATED IN THE LAW THE TWO PRINCIPAL POINTS UPON WHICH JUDGE FOELL RULED WERE THESE FIRST THE SUPREME COURT HAS HELD THAT THE MAYOR IS GIVEN ONLY THE POWER TO APPOINT MEMBERS OF THE SCHOOL BOARD NOT TO REMOVE SECOND THAT THE MAYOR CANNOT DO INDIRECTLY WHAT HE IS NOT GIVEN THE DIRECT POWER TO DO THE HOLDING OF RESIGNATIONS OVER THE HEADS OF HIS APPOINTEES VIRTUALLY GIVES HIM THE POWER OF REMOVAL MEETING OF THE ILLINOIS SCHOOLMASTERS CLUB THE FEBRUARY MEETING OF THE ILLINOIS SCHOOLMASTERS CLUB PRESIDENT DIRECTOR T C BURGESS BRADLEY INSTITUTE PEORIA WAS HELD AT DECATUR FEBRUARY 13 AND 14 AT THE FRIDAY EVENING SESSION AFTER THE USUAL BANQUET AN ADDRESS WAS GIVEN BY PRESIDENT W P MORGAN OF MACOMB NORMAL ON THE TOPIC CORRELATION OF GRADES MADE BY HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS AND WHAT THEY MEAN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF COLLEGE EN TRANCE ELABORATE STATISTICS WERE PRESENTED SHOWING THE RELATIVE STAND ING OF HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS THROUGH THE FOUR YEARS AND ALSO IN THE FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT A STUDENTS RECORD IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF HIS HIGHSCHOOL COURSE MAY BE SAFELY TAKEN AS A BASIS FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE THE FOURTH YEAR IS AS GOOD EVIDENCE OF FITNESS TO GO ON WITH COLLEGE WORK AS THE RECORD OF THE THIRD YEAR IS FOR ADMISSION TO THE FOURTH SUCH A MEANS OF DETERMINING FITNESS IS FAIRER THAN AN EXAMINATION GIVEN BY THE COLLEGE A CAREFUL RECORD OF EACH STUDENT BOTH RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND IN THE FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE WORK MAY SERVE ALSO AS A BASIS FOR TESTING AND CLASSIFYING HIGH SCHOOLS 269THE SCHOOL REVIEW AT THE SATURDAY MORNING SESSION SUPERINTENDENT SMITH OF PEORIA PRESENTED IN SOME DETAIL NEWER PHASES OF EDUCATIONAL WORK WHICH ARE BEING TRIED BY THE SCHOOL BOARD OF THAT CITY PARTICULARLY SPECIAL CLASSES AND TEACHERS FOR DEFECTIVES A VISITING NURSE TO LOOK AFTER GENERAL HEALTH AND A SAVINGS BANK SYSTEM SUPERINTENDENT ENGLEMANN OF DECATUR DISCUSSED THE QUESTION DOES OUR ORGANIZATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL NEED CHANGING FROM AN 84 TO A DIFFERENT BASIS  THE ADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD COME FROM A GROUPING OF THE FIRST SIX GRADES THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADES AND THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE WERE FULLY STATED IN THE SMALLER TOWNS THE DIVISION WOULD NECESSARILY BE 633 IN DISCUSSION PROFESSOR C H JOHNSTON OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS PRESENTED THE EVIDENCE OF THE SUCCESSFUL WORKING OF THIS NEW ARRANGEMENT IN MANY TOWNS AND CITIES FROM MAINE TO CALIFORNIA RECOGNITION OF SCHOLARSHIP WAS THE TITLE OF A SUGGESTIVE PAPER BY PRINCIPAL T J MCCORMACK OF LA SALLE IT WAS A PLEA FOR A PUBLIC OPINIONA SCHOOL ATMOSPHEREWHICH WOULD BESTOW AS PROMPT AND INSPIRING RECOGNITION UPON SCHOLARSHIP AS IS NOW THE CASE UPON OTHER ACTIVITIES A DEPARTURE IN EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITS MR BARR DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION AT THE PANAMAPACIFIC EXPOSITION IS MATURING PLANS WHICH CAN HARDLY FAIL TO BE OF GENUINE INTEREST TO EDU CATIONAL PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IN PAST EXPOSITIONS THE EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITS HAVE BEEN MADE BY VARIOUS TOWNS CITIES COUNTRIES AND STATES WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO ONE ANOTHER THE CITY OF NEW YORK FOR INSTANCE EXHIBITED WHAT IT CONSIDERED TO BE ITS BEST WORK THE CITIES OF BOSTON BUFFALO CHICAGO LOS ANGELES AND MANY OTHERS DID THE SAME THING EVEN IF THEY DUPLICATED PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING FOUND IN THE NEW YORK EXHIBIT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO EFFORT MADE IN PAST EXPOSITIONS TO PRESENT A REALLY PRACTICAL EXHIBIT OF THE BEST WORK TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND TO AVOID WEARISOME DUPLICATION BUT MR BARR PROPOSES TO FOLLOW A DIFFERENT PLAN IN THE EXHIBIT AT SAN FRANCISCO HE AND HIS ASSISTANTS WILL LOOK OVER THE WORLD AND FIND OUT WHERE THE BEST WORK IN MANUAL TRAINING FOR INSTANCE IS BEING DONE AND THEY WILL HAVE THIS WORK DIS PLAYED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ANYONE INTERESTED IN IT MAY EASILY RECEIVE HELP FROM IT NO OTHER TOWN CITY STATE OR COUNTRY WILL MAKE AN EXHIBIT OF MANUAL TRAINING BECAUSE THE BEST EXHIBIT THAT CAN BE MADE HAS BEEN SECURED MR BARR AND HIS COLLEAGUES WILL GO THROUGH EVERY 270EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT PHASE OF SCHOOL WORK AND TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS BEING DONE IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY THE EXHIBIT WILL BE MADE FROM THAT PLACE IF THIS PLAN IS FULLY REALIZED AS IT DOUBTLESS WILL BE THE EDUCATIONAL EXHIBITS WILL SHOW IN AN ORDERLY SYSTEMATIZED WAY WITHOUT REPETITION THE MOST INSTRUCTIVE EDUCATIONAL WORK WHICH IS GOING FORWARD ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TODAY A TEACHER THEN MAY WITHOUT CONFUSION OR FATIGUE STUDY THE EXHIBITS WITH A VIEW TO INFORMING HIMSELF REGARDING THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE WORK IN ANY SUBJECT OR FIELD IN WHICH HE IS INTERESTED THERE CAN BE NO RIVALRY BETWEEN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES OR INSTITUTIONS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES NO EXHIBITS WILL BE MADE FOR MERE ADVERTISING PURPOSES WHICH HAS BEEN THE CHIEF CONSIDERATION IN THE EXHIBITS IN PAST EXPOSITIONS AN EDUCATIONAL EXPOSITION WORKED OUT ON THIS PLAN CANNOT FAIL TO EXERT A TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE FOR GOOD ON TEACHING IN THIS COUNTRY M V OSHEA FREE TEXTBOOKS CALIFORNIA HAS HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF ONE YEAR UNDER THE FREETEXTBOOKS LAW THE SYSTEM WAS PUT IN OPERATION JANUARY I I913 DURING THE YEAR THE STATE HAS FURNISHED AND DISTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY I500OOOO BOOKS COSTING THE STATE 3I6000 IT HAS BEEN ASSERTED THAT THE COST PER PUPIL FOR BOOKS DURING THE ENTIRE YEAR WAS LESS THAN 80 CENTS AND THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN SAVED 500000 THIS LAST ESTIMATE IS BASED UPON PRICES WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID FOR BOOKS AS CATALOGUED BY GENERAL PUBLISHING FIRMS THIS EXPERIMENT IN CALIFORNIA IS BEING WATCHED VERY CLOSELY BY SEVERAL OTHER STATES NEBRASKA WYOMING COLORADO MINNESOTA PENNSYLVANIA AND OTHERS ALREADY HAVE FREE TEXTBOOKS KENTUCKY PASSED A LAW FOR UNIFORM TEXTS ON FEBRUARY 4 NATURALLY THE STEP FROM STATEWIDE UNIFORMITY IN TEXTBOOKS TO STATE PUBLISHING IS BUT A SHORT ONE KANSAS SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF CALIFORNIA AND IOWA GEORGIA KENTUCKY MINNESOTA AND WASHINGTON ARE STRONGLY AGITATING THE QUESTION AMONG THE ADVANTAGES THAT MAY BE GAINED BY STATE PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION ARE THE FOLLOWING I UNDER PROPER MANAGEMENT A SAVING OF AT LEAST OF 50 PER CENT IN THE COST OF BOOKS 2 EASE IN SECURING DESIR ABLE UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE 3 FREQUENT CHANGES HIGHLY UNDESIRABLE ARE LESS LIKELY 4 FREEDOM FROM THE CONSTANT STRIFE AND AGITATION STIRRED UP BY COMPETING BOOK FIRMS IN TENNESSEE THE GOVERNOR HAS SEEN FIT IN APPOINTING THE NEW TEXTBOOK COMMISSION TO WARN HIS 27ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW APPOINTEES AGAINST THE WILES OF BOOK AGENTS 5 THE ADAPTATION OF BOOKS TO LOCAL NEEDS THE KANSAS COMMISSION ASSERTING THAT THE ILLUSTRATIONS OF FARM LIFE IN MOST TEXTS ARE MERE CARICATURES HAS HIRED AN ARTIST TO DRAW SIXTY PICTURES OF REAL FARM LIFE FOR NEW PRIMERS 6 THE MONEY EXPENDED FOR BOOKS STAYS WITHIN THE STATE WITH THE EXCEPTION PERHAPS OF ROYALTIES PAID TO AUTHORS PROMISCUOUS CHANGING OF TEXTBOOKS OHIO IS EXPERIENCING HEAVY EXPENSE AND INCONVENIENCE CAUSED BY THE INADEQUATE TEXTBOOK REGULATIONS THE PRESENT LAW PROVIDES THAT SCHOOL BOOKS SHALL BE ADOPTED AND CONTRACTS LET FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS ANY SCHOOL BOARD HOWEVER BY A VOTE OF FIVESIXTHS OF ITS MEMBERS MAY CANCEL THE CONTRACTS AND ADOPT NEW BOOKS AT ANY REGULAR MEETING UNDER THIS LATTER PROVISION ACCORDING TO WIDESPREAD COMPLAINT THROUGH OUT THE STATE THE BOOK CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO NULLIFY THE FIVEYEAR CONTRACTS IN MANY CITIES THE MIXING IN LOCAL SCHOOL POLITICS OF OUT SIDERS WITH BOOKS TO SELL HOWEVER GOOD THE BOOKS MAY BE HAS BECOME EXASPERATING TO MANY SCHOOL AUTHORITIES BAD AS THE PRESENT SYSTEM IN OHIO IS IT IS TO BE SERIOUSLY QUESTIONED WHETHER THE THOMAS BILL PROPOSED IN THE LEGISLATURE IS ANY IMPROVEMENT THE BILL PROVIDES THAT NO TEXTBOOK NOW IN USE SHALL BE CHANGED PRIOR TO I9I9 AND THAT EVERY FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER TEXTBOOKS SHALL BE ADOPTED FOR FIVEYEAR PERIODS NO CHANGE BEING PERMITTED WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED PERIOD THE OBJECTION TO THIS LAW IS THAT IT MAY FASTEN INFERIOR BOOKS UPON THE SCHOOLS FOR NEARLY A WHOLE SCHOOL GENERATION INDEED RIGID STATEWIDE UNIFORMITY OF ANY KIND MAY SERIOUSLY BE QUESTIONED ANY SUITABLE LAW OUGHT TO MAKE PROVISION FOR AT LEAST A REASONABLE RANGE OF SELECTION BY VARIOUS LOCALITIES IN THIS MATTER AGAIN CALIFORNIA SEEMS TO HAVE SUGGESTED A METHOD OF PROCEDURE LET A STATE PRESCRIBE AND PUBLISH UNIFORM TEXTBOOKS WITH REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR SELECTION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES LET THE LAW GO INTO OPERATION WITH REGARD TO A FEW SUBJECTS AT A TIME IN THIS WAY THE IMMEDIATE BURDEN UPON THE STATE MAY BE MADE LIGHT FLEXIBLE COURSES OF STUDY BE MAINTAINED AND THE IRRITATING PERSISTENCE OF BOOK EXPLOITERS BE AVOIDED A PLEA FOR A STATE UNIVERSITY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SUPERINTENDENT HENRY C MORRISON OF NEW HAMPSHIRE IN A RECENT ADDRESS BEFORE THE MERRIMACK VALLEY TEACHERS ASSOCIATION MADE A VIGOROUS PLEA FOR A STATE UNIVERSITY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE HIS ARGUMENT 272EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT IS BASED UPON THE ASSERTION THAT THE NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION OF COL LEGES IS TO ALL INTENTS AN EDUCATIONAL TRUST DICTATING THE EDUCATIONAL POLICY OF THE WHOLE OF NEW ENGLAND AND THAT A STATE UNIVERSITY IS NECES SARY TO ROUND OUT A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS OF THE STATE AFTER NAMING THE SIXTEEN COLLEGES WHICH ARE REPRESENTED ON THE NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE ENTRANCE BOARD MR MORRISON CONTINUES THIS BOARD DETERMINES FOR ITSELF WHAT CONSTITUTES THE PROPER TEACHING FORCE PROGRAM OF STUDY AND EQUIPMENT FOR A SECONDARY SCHOOL AND IT MEASURES ACCORDING TO ITS OWN STANDARDS THE EFFICIENCY OF ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHICH DESIRE TO SEND STUDENTS UPON CERTIFICATE TO ANY OF THE COLLEGES HAVING MEMBERSHIP IN THE BOARD IT IS ESSENTIALLY AN APPLICATION OF THE TRUST PRINCIPLE IN EDUCATION  THE BOARD HAS OF LATE BEEN FOLLOWING OUT THE NATURAL COURSE OF EVOLUTION OF THE INDUSTRIAL TRUSTS BY COMPELLING SMALL INSTITUTIONS TO COME WITHIN ITS MEMBERSHIPS FOR SELFPROTECTION MR MORRISON THEN CITES AS EVIDENCE OF WHAT HE THINKS IS THE AUTO CRATIC AND HIGHHANDED DOMINATION OF THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE BOARD THE CASE OF THE DOVER HIGH SCHOOL WHICH WAS LAST YEAR SUMMARILY DROPPED FROM SCHOOLS ON THE ACCREDITED LIST HE SAYS DURING THE LAST YEAR THIS SCHOOL SENT 67 STUDENTS TO COLLEGES THIRTEEN OF THEM REPRESENTED ON THE NEW ENGLAND BOARD OF THIS NUMBER FOUR HAVE FAILED SIXTYTHREE STUDENTS DID NOT FAIL AND IN MANY CASES THEY ARE REPORTED BY THE COLLEGES AS HAVING DONE HIGHGRADE WORK  THE DOVER AUTHORITIES MIGHT READILY RECOVER THEIR POSITION IN THE GOOD GRACES OF THESE PEOPLE IF THEY WERE WILLING THAT THE TEACHING FORCE SHOULD DEVOTE ITS MAIN ATTENTION TO CRAM MING THE PITIFULLY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO EVER GO TO ANY OF THESE COLLEGES TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO MAKE THE STUDENTS CAPABLE OF AUTOMATICALLY GETTING BY THE FIRST SEMESTER OF INDIFFERENT OR MEDIOCRE TEACHING IN COLLEGE THE PRINCIPAL OF A HIGH SCHOOL RECENTLY SAID TO ME TWO OF THE MEMBERS OF MY FACULTY PRACTICALLY DEVOTE ALL THEIR INTERESTS FOR FOUR LONG YEARS TO THE TWO OR THREE CHILDREN OF WELLTODO FAMILIES WHO MAY POSSIBLY GO TO SOME COLLEGE REPRESENTED ON THE NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE ENTRANCE BOARD THE REAL KEYNOTE OF SUPERINTENDENT MORRISONS ARGUMENT LIES IN THE CONTENTION THAT THE ENTRANCE BOARD EXERTS UNDUE INFLUENCE ON THE CUR RICULUM EVERY SCHOOL WHICH INTRODUCES A CURRICULUM DEALING WITH THE PRACTICAL CONCERNS OF EVERYDAY LIFE DOES SO IN THE FULL ASSURANCE THAT STUDENTS ELECTING THAT CURRICULUM CAN GO NO FARTHER CAN FIND NO OUTLET TO ANY HIGHER INSTITUTION  IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES YOU CAN BEGIN TO DETECT THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEW ENGLAND BOARD AT ABOUT THE SIXTH GRADE TEACHERS ARE BEGINNING THERE TO LOOK OUT FOR THE STANDARD WHICH THE HIGH SCHOOL MUST MAINTAIN AS THE HIGH SCHOOL IN ITS TURN MUST LOOK OUT FOR THIS COLLEGE STANDARD IT IS BUILDING 273THE SCHOOL REVIEW FROM THE TOP DOWN INSTEAD OF FROM THE BOTTOM UP I BELIEVE THEREFORE THAT I AM WELL WITHIN THE TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES TODAY IS DOMINATED BY AN IRRESPONSIBLE BODY OF MEN OF WHOSE EXISTENCE THE GREAT MASS OF OUR PEOPLE ARE IGNORANT BASING HIS CONVICTION ON THESE TWO CONTENTIONS THAT THE NEW ENG LAND BOARD IS ARROGANT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF THE MERITS OF HIGH SCHOOLS AND THAT THE PRESSURE OF THE BOARD IS NOTICEABLE THROUGHOUT ALL THE SECONDARY SCHOOL AND PART OF THE ELEMENTARYSCHOOL ACTIVITIES MR MORRISON PLEADS FOR A STATE INSTITUTION THAT SHALL SERVE NEW HAMPSHIRE AS THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE AND THE VARIOUS STATE UNIVERSITIES OF THE WEST ARE SERVING THEIR STATES THESE INSTITUTIONS HE ASSERTS HAVE FRANKLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD ADAPT ITSELF TO THE WORK DONE BY THE LOWER SCHOOLS FOR THE GREAT MASS OF THE POPULATION AND THAT THE COLLEGES IN THEIR TURN SHOULD ADAPT THEIR WORK TO WHAT THE HIGH SCHOOL HAS DONE SO ONLY CAN WE BUILD FOR OURSELVES AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WHICH SHALL BE BOTH RATIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC  WE NEED AN INSTITUTION IN WHICH THERE SHALL BE A PLACE FOR EVERY BOY AND GIRL WHO IS ABLE TO MAKE HIS WAY IN COLLEGE AND WHICH SHALL NEVER DARE TO RAISE ANY ARTIFICIAL AND ARBITRARY OBSTACLES IN THE PATHWAY OF EDUCATION  I BELIEVE THAT THE NATURAL SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM AND INDEED THE ONLY SOLUTION IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRUE STATE UNIVERSITY IN OUR MIDST THIS POWERFUL ARRAIGNMENT OF COLLEGE DOMINATION IS SIGNIFICANT COM ING FROM THE CHIEF EDUCATIONAL OFFICER OF NEW HAMPSHIRE UNDER WHOSE LEADERSHIP THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS HAVE MADE SUCH RADICAL PROGRESS ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT H A BROWN IN THE MARCH AND APRIL NUMBERS OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW HAS SET FORTH CLEARLY THE EARNEST ENDEAVOR THAT THE LEADERS OF EDUCATION IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE MAKING TO BRING THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS INTO DIRECT AND VITAL CONNECTION WITH THE LIFE OF THE STATE IT IS MORE THAN AN ENDEAVOR THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED WITH SOME DISTASTE EVEN THE STATE UNI VERSITIES ARE COMING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY MUST LOOSEN THEIR HOLD ON THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND YIELD TO THE CONSTANT AND INCREASING DEMAND FOR THE RECOGNITION OF SUBJECTS NOT FORMERLY ACCREDITED FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE THE NATIONWIDE INSISTENCE THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL SHALL BECOME THE PEOPLES COLLEGE IS BOUND TO BE REALIZED IT IS RIGHT THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE MAJORITY SHOULD ALWAYS BE GIVEN EARNEST CONSIDERATION AND USUALLY PREFERENCE THE DOMINATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION BY COLLEGES LIKE THOSE OF THE NEW ENGLAND BOARD HAS BEEN OF INCALCULABLE BENEFIT DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS ON THE WHOLE THEIR INFLUENCE HAS BEEN CONSERVATIVE THOUGH MANY OF THE INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE RECENTLY COME INTO SECONDARY EDU CATION HAVE HAD THEIR INCEPTION IN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CIRCLES TODAY 274EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT THERE IS A NEW GROUP OF LEADERS OF WHOM SUPERINTENDENT MORRISON IS ONE WHO SEE THAT THE VAST BODY OF THE PEOPLE MUST BE HELPED IN THE SCHOOLS FOR THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE UNDER SUCH LEADERSHIP THE SECONDARYSCHOOL CURRICULUM HAS EXPANDED AND NOW INCLUDES MANY SUBJECTS THAT THE CONSERVATIVE COLLEGES HESITATE TO ACCEPT FOR ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS PROPER ARTICULATION BETWEEN THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGE IS COM PLICATED IN NEW ENGLAND AS ELSEWHERE BY MANY DIFFICULTIES OF WHICH TWO MAY BE NOTED HERE FIRST THE CURRICULUM OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS CAN BE EXPANDED VERY MUCH MORE READILY THAN THE CURRICULUM OF MOST COLLEGES WHILE THE SCHOOLS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN GROUPING THEIR WORK IN HIGHLY SPECIALIZED COURSES THE MAJORITY OF THE COLLEGES OF THE NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION REMAIN RELATIVELY SMALL INSTITUTIONS WITH FEW INSTRUCTORS AND FEW COURSES IT IS HARDLY TO BE EXPECTED THAT A COLLEGE ASSOCIATION CAN GIVE ENTRANCE CREDIT FOR A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF COURSES IF THE MAJORITY OF THE COLLEGES ARE UNABLE TO CARRY THOSE COURSES FARTHER IT MAY BE REMARKED TOO THAT THE COLLEGE AUTHORITIES ARE BETTER ABLE THAN THE SECONDARYSCHOOL OFFICERS TO DETERMINE WHAT SCHOOL SUBJECTS ARE IN LINE WITH THE FEW ADVANCED COURSES WHICH THE COLLEGES ARE ABLE TO OFFER FOR EXAMPLE VERY FEW OF THE NEW ENGLAND COLLEGES ARE EQUIPPED TO CARRY FARTHER STUDENTS WHO HAVE SPECIALIZED IN THE CURRICULUM OF MANUAL ARTS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE CURRICULUM IS DESCRIBED ON P 236 OF THIS ISSUE OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW THAT BEING THE CASE THE ASSOCIATION IS JUSTIFIED IN REFUSING ENTRANCE CREDIT EXCEPT TO HIGHLY TECHNICAL COLLEGES FOR MANY OF THE SUBJECTS IN THE CURRICULUM OF MANUAL ARTS THE PROPER ARTICULATION OF COLLEGE AND SECONDARY SCHOOL IS DIFFICULT ALSO BECAUSE THE COLLEGE IN ITS ORGANIZATION AND COURSES AIMS TO ACT AS A SELECTIVE AGENCY WHILE THE HIGH SCHOOL AS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION CANNOT TURN AWAY ANY SERIOUS STUDENTS WHO ARE SEEKING A PREPARATION FOR PRAC TICAL LIFE RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY THE COLLEGE TODAY AIMS TO MAKE SHORT WORK OF DROPPING STUDENTS IF THEY ARE INCOMPETENT HOWEVER PAINSTAKING AND FAITHFUL THEIR EFFORTS MAY BE THE COLLEGE FEELS THAT IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED IN GIVING ITS STAMP OF APPROVAL TO INCOMPETENTS THIS BEING THE CASE IN ALL JUSTICE TO STUDENTS SEEKING TO ENTER THE COLLEGE IS UNDER OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN A HIGH STANDARD OF ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS A COLLEGE WHICH DELIBERATELY ACCEPTS STUDENTS WHO ARE POORLY PREPARED ONLY TO DROP THEM AFTER A TRIAL WHICH IS DOOMED FROM THE BEGINNING TO BE A FAILURE IS TO BE UNSPARINGLY CONDEMNED CONTRAST WITH THIS SELECTIVE PROCESS WHICH THE COLLEGES ARE ENDEAVORING TO MAINTAIN THE DUTY OF A SCHOOL SYSTEM LIKE THAT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS A PUPIL HAS A RIGHT 275THE SCHOOL REVIEW TO REMAIN EVEN TO THE END HOWEVER MEDIOCRE HIS WORK MAY BE IF HE IS DOING THE BEST WORK OF WHICH HE IS CAPABLE HOWEVER IT BY NO MEANS FOLLOWS THAT BECAUSE HE REMAINS TO THE END IN A SCHOOL WHICH DOES NOT AIM TO BE SELECTIVE HE IS THEREBY FITTED TO ENTER A HIGHER SCHOOL WHICH IS ATTEMPTING TO BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE THE HIGH SCHOOL OF THE PAST HAS BEEN TRYING TO FIT A FEW OF ITS STU DENTS FOR COLLEGE AND TO FIT THE LARGE MAJORITY FOR PRACTICAL LIFE IT HAS ATTEMPTED TO PUT BOTH GROUPS THROUGH THE SAME COURSES OF STUDY HOPE IN THE FUTURE SEEMS TO LIE IN JUST SUCH CHANGES AS SUPERINTENDENT MORRI SON HAS INSTITUTED NAMELY VARIETY IN THE HIGHSCHOOL CURRICULUM IF A BOY ELECTS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE CURRICULUM IN MECHANICAL ARTS HE MAY BE PREPARING FOR WORK AT THE END OF HIS HIGHSCHOOL COURSE HE MAY AT THE SAME TIME LEAVE OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SECURING ENTRANCE CREDIT FOR THE DARTMOUTH ENGINEERING SCHOOL IF ANOTHER LAD FINISHES THE CUR RICULUM IN AGRICULTURE HE MAY GO TO WORK OR HE MAY BE GIVEN FULL ENTRANCE CREDIT FOR THE AGRICULTURAL COURSE IN CORNELL IF A GIRL COMPLETES THE CURRICULUM OF DOMESTIC SCIENCE SHE MAY BECOME A HOUSEKEEPER OR SHE MAY DESERVE FULL ENTRANCE CREDIT FOR A SPECIALIZED COURSE IN SIM MONS

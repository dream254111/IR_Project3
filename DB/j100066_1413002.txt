j100066,The American Journal of Psychology,1413002,The Association Method,i261648,THE ASSOCIATION METHOD By PROFESSOR CARL G JUNG Ladies and Gentlemen When I was honored with the in vitation from Clark University to lecture before this esteemed assemblage a wish was at the same time expressed that I should speak about my methods of work and especially about the psychology of childhood I hope to accomplish this task in the following manner In my first lecture I shall try to present to you the view points of my association methods in my second lecture I shall discuss the significance of the familiar constellations while in my third lecture I shall enter more fully into the psychology of the child I might easily confine myself exclusively to my theoretical views but I believe that it will be better to illustrate my lectures with as many practical examples as possible We shall there fore occupy ourselves first with the method of association a method which has been of valuable assistance to me both prac tically and theoretically The association method in vogue in psychology as well as its history is of course so familiar to you that there is no need to speak of it For practical pur poses I make use of the following formulary x head 2 green 3 water 4 to sing 5 dead 6 long 7 ship 8 to pay 9 window io friendly II to cook 12 to ask 13 cold 14 stem 15 to dance 16 village 17 lake 18

formulary has been constructed after many years of ex perience The words are chosen and partially arranged in such a manner as to strike easily almost all complexes of practical occurrence As shown by the above formulary there is a reg ular mixing of the grammatical qualities of the words This too has its definite reasons Before the experiment begins the test person receives the following instruction Answer as quickly as possible the first word that occurs to your mind This instruction is so simple that it can easily be followed by anybody The work itself moreover appears extremely easy so that it might be expected that any one could accomplish it with the greatest facility and promptitude But contrary to expectation the behavior is quite different An Example of a Normal

ASSOCIATION METHOD 223 4 3 2 I 6 5 4 3 2 I The illustrations below pp 224 ff show the course of the reaction time in hysterical individuals The light crosshatched columns denote the locations where the test person was unable to react socalled failures The first thing that strikes us is the fact that many test per sons show a marked prolongation of the reaction time This would make us think at first of intellectual difficulties wrongly however as we are often dealing with very intelligent persons of fluent speech The explanation lies rather in the emotions In order to understand the matter comprehensively we must bear in mind that the association experiments cannot deal with a separated psychic function for any psychic occur ence is never a thing in itself but is always the resultant of the entire psychological past The association experiment too is not merely a method for the reproduction of separated word couplets but it is a kind of pastime a conversation between experimenter and test person In a certain sense it is even still more than that Words are really something like con densed actions situations and things When I present a word to the test person which denotes an action it is the same as if I should present to him the action itself and ask him How do you behave towards it What do you think of it What do you do in this situation If I were a magician I should cause the situation corresponding to the stimulus word to ap pear in reality and placing the test person in its midst I should then study his manner of reaction The result of my stimulus words would thus undoubtedly approach infinitely nearer per fection But as we are not magicians we must be contented with the linguistic substitutes for reality at the same time we224 JUNG must not forget that the stimulus word will as a rule always conjure up its corresponding situation It all depends on how the test person reacts to this situation The situation bride or bridegroom will not evoke a simple reaction in a young lady but the reaction will be deeply influenced by the provoked strong feeling tones the more so if the experimenter be a man It thus happens that the test person is often unable to react 0 f 0n cu c THR ASSOCIATION METHOD 225 quickly and smoothly to all stimulus words In reality too there are certain stimulus words which denote actions situa tions or things about which the test person cannot think quickly and surely and this fact is shown in the association experiments The example which I have just presented shows an abundance of long reaction times and other disturbances LLo  l226 JUNG In this case the reaction to the stimulus word is in some way impeded that is the adaptation to the stimulus word is dis turbed The stimulus words are therefore merely a part of reality acting upon us indeed a person who shows such dis turbances to the stimulus words is in a certain sense really but imperfectly adapted to reality Disease is an imperfect adapta tion hence in this case we are dealing with something morbid 20 15O o   in the psychewith something which is either temporary or persistently pathological that is we are dealing with a psy choneurosis with a functional disturbance of the mind This rule however as we shall see later is not without its ex ceptions Let us in the first place continue the discussion concerning the prolonged reaction time It often happens that the test person actually does not know what to answer to the stimulusTHZ ASSOCIATION METHOD 227 word The test person waives any reaction for the moment he totally fails to obey the original instructions and shows himself incapable of adapting himself to the experimenter If this phenomenon occurs frequently in an experiment it signifies a higher degree of disturbance in adjustment I call attention to the fact that it is quite indifferent what reason the test per son gives for the refusal Some find that too many ideas suddenly occur to them others that not enough ideas come to their minds In most cases however the difficulties first per ceived are so deterrent that they actually give up the whole reaction The following example shows a case of hysteria with many failures of reaction Stimulus Reaction word Time Reaction Reproduction Unito2 second to sing 9 nice  dead 15 awful long 40 the time the journey  ship t  to pay II money window Io big high

misunderstanding t Denotes repetition of the stimulus words In example 3 we find a characteristic phenomenon The test person is not content with the requirements of the instruction that is she is not satisfied with one word but reacts with many words She apparently does more and better than the instruc tion requires but in so doing she does not fulfill the require ments of the instruction Thus she reactscustomgood barbaric foolishnarrow mindedrestricted familybig smalleverything possible228 JUNG These examples show in the first place that many other words connect themselves with the reaction word The test person is unable to suppress the ideas which subsequently occur to her In doing this she also pursues a certain tendency which perhaps is more distinctly expressed in the following reaction newoldas an opposite The addition of as an opposite denotes that the test person has the desire to add something explanatory or supplementary This tendency is also shown in the following reaction fingernot only hand also foota limbmemberextremity Here we have a whole series of supplements It seems as if the reaction were not sufficient for the test person as if some thing else must always be added as if what has been already said were incorrect or in some way imperfect This feeling we may with Janet designate as the senfiment dinconipltude which by no means explains everything I enter somewhat deeper into this phenomenon because it is quite frequently encountered in neurotic individuals Indeed it is not merely a small and un important subsidiary manifestation in an insignificant experi ment but rather an elemental and universal manifestation which otherwise plays a r6le in the psychic life of neurotics With his desire to supplement the test person betrays a ten dency to give the experimenter more than he wants he even exerts the greatest efforts to seek further mental occurrences in order finally to discover something quite satisfactory If we translate this elementary observation into the psychology of everyday life it signifies that the test person has a tendency constantly to give to others more feeling than is required and expected According to Freud this is a sign of a reinforced objectlibido that is it is a compensation for an inner unsatis faction and voidness of feeling In this elementary observation we therefore see one of the main qualities of hysterics namely the tendency to allow themselves to be carried away by every thing to attach themselves enthusiastically to everything and to always promise too much and hence do little Pa tients having this symptom in my experience are always hard to deal with at first they are enthusiastically enraptured with the physician for a time going so far as to accept every thing blindly but they soon merge into just as blind a resist ance against the physician thus rendering any educative influence absolutely impossible We see therefore in this phenomenon the expression of a ten dency to give more than the instruction demands and expects This tendency betrays itself also in other failures to follow the instruction to quarrelangrydifferent thingsI always quarrel at home to marryhow can you marryreunionunionTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 229 plumto eatto pluckwhat do you mean by itis it symbolic to sinthis idea is quite strange to me I do not recognize it These reactions show that the test person gets away alto gether from the situation of the experiment For the instruc tion demands that he should answer only the word which next occurs to him Here we find that the stimulus words apparently act with excessive strength that they are taken as if they were direct personal questions The test person entirely forgets that we deal with mere words which stand in print before us and seeks in them a personal meaning he tries to divine them and defend himself against them thus altogether forgetting the instructions This elementary observation depicts another common pecu liarity of hysterics namely that of taking everything person ally of never being able to remain objective and of allowing themselves to be carried away by momentary impressions this again shows the characteristics of the enhanced object libido Another sign of impeded adaptation is the often occurring repetitions of the stimulus words The test persons repeat the stimulus word as if they had not heard or understood it dis tinctly They repeat it just as we repeat a difficult question in order better to grasp it before answering This same ten dency is shown in the experiment The questions are repeated because the stimulus words act on hysterical individuals almost like difficult and personal questions In principle it is the same phenomenon as the subsequent completion of the re action In many experiments we observe that the same reaction constantly reappears to the most varied stimulus words These words seem to possess a special reproduction tendency and it is very interesting to examine their relationship to the test person For example I have observed a case in which the patient repeated the word  short  a great many times and often in places where it had no meaning The test person could not directly state the reason for the repetition of the word short From experience I knew that such predicates always relate either to the test person himself or to the person nearest to him I assumed that in this word short  he designated himself and that in this way he helped to express something very painful to him The test person is of very small stature He is the youngest of four brothers who in contrast to him are all tall He was always the child  in the family he was nicknamed Short and was treated by all as the little one This resulted in a total loss of self confidence Although he was intelligent and despite long JOURNAL4230 JUNG study he could not decide to present himself for examination he finally became impotent and merged into a psychosis in which whenever he was alone he took delight in walking about in his room on his toes in order to appear taller The word short therefore signified to him a great many pain ful experiences This is usually the case with the repeated words they always contain something very important for the individual psychology of the test person The signs thus far depicted are not found arbitrarily spread throughout the whole experiment but only in very definite locations namely in those stimulus words which strike against special emotionally accentuated complexes This fact is the foundation of the socalled diagnosis of facts Tat bestandsdiagnostik that is of the method employed to dis cover by means of an association experiment the culprit among a number of persons suspected of a crime That this is possible I should like to demonstrate briefly in a concrete case On the 6th of February 19o8 our supervisor reported to me that a nurse complained to her of having been robbed during the forenoon of the previous day The facts were as follows The nurse kept her money amounting to 70 francs in a pocketbook which she had placed in her cupboard where she also kept her clothes The cupboard contained two com partments of which one belonged to the nurse who was robbed and the other to the head nurse These two nurses and a third one who was an intimate friend of the head nurse slept in the same room where the cupboard was The room was in a section which was regularly occupied in common by six nurses who had free access to this room Given such a state of affairs it is not to be wondered that the supervisor shrugged her shoulders when I asked her whom she most suspected Further investigation showed that on the morning of the theft the abovementioned friend of the head nurse was slightly indisposed and remained in bed in the room the whole morn ing Hence following the indications of the plaintiff the theft could have taken place only in the afternoon Of the other four nurses upon whom suspicion could fall there was only one who regularly attended to the cleaning of the room in question while the remaining three had nothing to do in this room nor was it shown that any of them had spent any time there on the previous day It was therefore natural that these last three nurses should be regarded for the time being as less implicated and I there fore began by subjecting the first three to the experiment From the particulars of the case I also knew that the cup board was locked but that the key was kept not far away in aTHE ASSOCIATION MIETHOD 231 very conspicuous place that on opening the cupboard the first thing to be seen was a fur ornament boa and moreover that the pocketbook was between the linen in an incon spicuous place The pocketbook was of dark reddish leather and contained the following objects one 50 franc banknote one 20 franc piece some centimes one small silver watch chain one stencil used in the insane asylum to mark the kitchen utensils and one small receipt from Dosenbachs shoeshop in Ziirich Besides the plaintiff and the guilty one only the head nurse knew the exact particulars of the deed for as soon as the former missed her money she immediately asked the head nurse to help her find it thus the head nurse had been able to learn the smallest details which naturally rendered the ex periment still more difficult for she was precisely the one most suspected The conditions for the experiment were bet ter for the others since they knew nothing concerning the particulars of the deed and some not even that a crime had been committed As critical stimulus words I selected the name of the robbed nurse plus the following words cup board door open key yesterday banknote gold 70 50 20 money watch pocketbook chain silver to hide fur dark reddish leather centimes stencil receipt Dosenbach Be sides these words which referred directly to the deed I took also the following which had a special affective value theft to take to steal suspicion blame court police to lie to fear to discover to arrest innocent The objection is often made to the last species of words that they may produce a strong affective resentment even in inno cent persons and for that reason one cannot attribute to them any comparative value Nevertheless it may always be ques tioned whether the affective resentment of an innocent person will have the same effect on the association as that of a guilty one and that question can only be authoritatively answered by experience Until the contrary shall be demonstrated I maintain that even words of the above mentioned type may profitably be used I then distributed these critical words among twice as many indifferent stimulus words in such a manner that each critical word was followed by two indifferent ones As a rule it is well to follow up the critical words by indifferent words in order that the action of the first may be clearly distinguished But one may also follow up one critical word by another es pecially if one wishes to bring into relief the action of the second Thus I placed together darkish red and leather and chain and silver After this preparatory work I undertook the experiment232 JUNG with the three above mentioned nurses As examinations of this kind can be rendered into a foreign tongue only with the greatest difficulty I will content myself with presenting the general results and with giving some examples I first under took the experiment with the friend of the head nurse and judging by the circumstances she appeared only slightly moved The head nurse was next examined she showed marked excitement her pulse being 120 per minute immedi ately after the experiment The last to be examined was the nurse who attended to the cleaning of the room in which the theft occurred She was the most tranquil of the three she displayed but little embarrassment and only in the course of the experiment did it occur to her that she was suspected of stealing a fact which manifestly disturbed her towards the end of the experiment The general impression from the examination spoke strongly against the head nurse It seemed to me that she evinced a very suspicious or I might almost say impudent coun tenance With the definite idea of finding in her the guilty one I set about adding up the results One can make use of many special methods of computing but they are not all equally good and equally exact One must always resort to calculation as appearances are enor mously deceptive The method which is most to be recom mended is that of the probable average of the reaction time It shows at a glance the difficulties which the person in the experiment had to overcome in the reaction The technique of this calculation is very simple The prob able average is the middle number of the various reaction times arranged in a series The reaction times are for example1 placed in the following manner 5557777 8999 12 13 14 The number found in the middle 8 is the probable average of this series Following the order of the experiment I shall denote the friend of the head nurse by the letter A the head nurse by B and the third nurse by C The probable averages of the reaction are A B C 100 120 135 No conclusions can be drawn from this result But the average reaction times calculated separately for the indifferent reactions for the critical and for those immediately following the critical postcritical are more interesting From this example we see that whereas A has the shortest reaction time for the indifferent reactions she shows in com 1Reaction times are always given in fifths of a secondTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 233 The Probable Average of the Reaction Time for A B C Indifferent reactions    Ioo IIo 120 Critical reactions  16o 13 I150

there are on an average for the indifferent critical etc reactions The Average Complex Indicators for each Reaction for A B C Indifferent reactions    06 09 08 Critical reactions    13 09 12 Post

imperfect reactions behave The result for A  34 for B  28 and for C 30 Here too A reaches the highest value and in this I believe we see the characteristic moment of the guiltcomplex in A I am however unable to explain here circumstantially the reasons why I maintain that memory errors are related to an emotional complex as this would lead me beyond the limits of the present work I therefore refer the reader to my work Ueber die Reproductionsstdrrungen im Associationsexperiment IX Beitrag der Diegnost Associat Studien As it often happens that an association of strong feeling tone produces in the experiment a perseveration with the result that not only the critical association but also two or three successive234 JUNG associations are imperfectly reproduced it will be very interest ing for our cases to see how many imperfect reproductions are so arranged in the series The result of computation shows that the imperfect reproductions thus arranged in series are for A 647 for B 555 and for C 300 Again we find that A has the greatest percentage To be sure this may partially depend on the fact that A also possesses the greatest number of imperfect reproductions Given a small quantity of reactions it is usual that the greater the total number of the same the more imperfect reactions will occur in groups But in order that this should be probable it could not occur in so great a measure as in our case where on the other hand B and C have not a much smaller number of imperfect reactions when compared to A It is significant that C with her slight emotions during the experiment shows the minimum of imperfect reproductions arranged in series As imperfect reproductions are also complex indicators it is necessary to see how they distribute themselves in respect to the indifferent critical etc reactions Imperfect Reproductions which occur in A B C Indifferent reactions    Io 12 II Critical reactions    19 9 12 Postcritical reactions  5 7 7 It is hardly necessary to bring into prominence the differences between the indifferent and the critical reactions of the various subjects as shown by the resulting numbers of the table In this respect too A occupies first place Naturally here too there is a probability that the greater the quantity of the imperfect reproductions the greater is their number in the critical reactions If we suppose that the im perfect reproductions are distributed regularly and without choice among all the reactions there will be a greater number of them for A in comparison to B and C even as reactions to critical words since A has the greater number of imperfect reproductions Admitting such a uniform distribution of the imperfect reproductions it is easy to calculate how many we ought to expect to belong to each individual kind of reaction From this calculation it appears that the disturbances of re productions which concern the critical reactions for A surpass by far the expected for C they are 09 higher than the exTHE

intensity and hence the greatest suspicion falls on A Practically one may venture to designate such a subject as probably guilty The same evening A made a complete confession of the theft and thus the success of the experiment was confirmed I maintain that such a result should be of scientific interest and worthy of consideration There is much in experimental psychology which is less useful than the material treated in this work Putting aside altogether the theoretical interest we have in this case something that is not to be despised from a practical point of view to wit we have brought to light the culpable affair in a much easier and shorter way than is cus tomary What has been possible once or twice ought to be possible again in other cases and it is well worth while to in vestigate the means of rendering the method increasingly capable of rapid and sure results This applicability of the experiment shows it possible to strike a concealed indeed an unconscious complex by means of a stimulous word and conversely we may assume with great certainty that behind a reaction which shows a complex indi cator there is a hidden complex even though the test person strongly denies it One must get rid of the idea that educated and intelligent test persons are able to see and admit their own complexes Every human mind contains much that is unac knowledged and hence unconscious as such and no one can boast that he stands completely above his complexes Those who persist in maintaining it do not see the spectacles which they wear on their noses It has long been thought that the association experiment236 JUNG enables one to distinguish certain intellectual types That is not the case The experiment does not give us any particular insight into the purely intellectual but rather only into the emotional processes To be sure we can erect certain types of reaction they are not however based on intellectual peculiari ties but depend entirely on the proportionate emotionalstate Educated test persons usually show superficial and linguisti cally deep rooted associations whereas the uneducated form more valuable associations and often of ingenious significance This behavior would be paradoxical from an intellectual view point The meaningful associations of the uneducated are not really the product of intellectual thinking but are simply the results of a special emotional state The whole thing is more important to the uneducated his emotion is greater and for that reason he pays more attention to the experiment than the educated person and that is why his associations are more sig nificant Aside from the types determined by education we have to consider three principal individual types i An objective type with undisturbed reactions 2 A socalled complex type with many disturbances in the experiment occasioned by the constellation of a complex 3 A socalled definitiontype This type consists in the fact that the reaction always gives an explanation or a defini tion of the content of the stimulus word e g applea treefruit tablea piece of household furniture to promenadean activity fatherchief of the family This type is chiefly found in stupid persons and it is therefore quite usual in imbecility But it can also be found in persons who are not really stupid but who do not wish to be taken as stupid Thus a young student from whom associations were taken by an older intelligent woman student reacted altogether with definitions The test person was of the opinion that it was an examination in intelligence and therefore directed most of his attention to the significance of the stimulus words his associations therefore looked like those of an idiot Not all idiots however react with definitions probably only those so react who would like to appear smarter than they are that is those to whom their stupidity is painful I designate this widespread complex as intelligencecomplex A normal test person reacts in a most overdrawn manner as follows anxietyheart anguish to kissloves unfolding to kissperception of friendship This type gives a constrained and unnatural impression The test persons wish to be more than they are they wish toTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 237 exert more influence than they really have Hence we see that persons with an intelligence complex are usually not nat ural and unconstrained that they are always somewhat un natural and flowery they show a predilection for complicated foreign words high sounding quotations and other intellectual ornaments In this way they wish to influence their fellow beings they wish to impress others with their apparent educa tion and intelligence and thus to compensate for the painful feeling of stupidity The definition type is closely related to the predicate type or to express it more precisely to the predicate type expressing personal judgment  Wertpriidikat tyfus For example flowerpretty moneyconvenient animalugly knifedangerous deathghastly In the definition type the intellectual significance of the stim ulus word is rendered prominent while in the predicate type it is its emotional significance There are predicate types which are altogether overdrawn where there appear reactions like the following pianohorrible to singheavenly motherardently loved fathersomething good nice holy In the definition type an absolute intellectual makeup is manifested or rather simulated but here there is a very emo tional one Yet just as the definition type really conceals a lack of intelligence so the excessive emotional expression con ceals or overcompensates an emotional deficiency This conclu sion is very interestingly illustrated by the following discovery On investigating the influence of the familiar milieus on the association type it was found that young individuals seldom possess a predicate type but that on the other hand the predicate type increases in frequency with the advancing age In women the increase of the predicate type begins a little after the 40th year and in men after the 6oth That is the precise time when owing to the deficiency of sexuality there actually occurs considerable emotional loss If a test person evinces a distinct predicate type it may always be inferred that a marked internal emotional deficiency is thereby compensated Still one cannot reason conversely namely that an inner emotional deficiency must produce a predicate type no more than that idiocy directly produces a definition type A predicate type can also betray itself through the external behavior as for ex ample through a particular affectation enthusiastic exclama tions an embellished behavior and the constrained sounding language so often observed in society238 JUNG The complex type shows no particular tendency except the concealment of a complex whereas the definition and predicate types betray a positive tendency to exert in some way a definite influence on the experimenter But whereas the definition type tends to bring to light its intelligence the predicate type displays its emotion I need hardly add of what importance such determinations are for the diagnosis of character After finishing an association experiment I usually add another experiment of a different kind the socalled repr oduction I repeat the same stimulus words and ask the test persons whether they still remember their former reactions In many instances the memory fails and as experience shows these locations are stimulus words which touched an emotionally accentuated complex or stimulus words immediately follow ing such critical words This phenomenon has been designated as paradoxical and contrary to all experience For it is known that emotionally accentuated things are better retained in memory than indif ferent things This is quite true but it does not hold for the linguistic expression of an emotionally accentuated content On the contrary one very easily forgets what he has said under emotion one is even apt to contradict himself about it Indeed the efficacy of crossexaminations in court depends on this fact The reproduction method therefore serves to render still more prominent the complex stimulus In normal persons we usually find a limited number of false reproductions seldom more than 1020 while in abnormal persons especially in hysterics we often find from 2040 of false reproductions The reproduc tion certainty is therefore in certain cases a measure for the emotivity of the test person By far the larger number of neurotics show a pronounced tendency to cover up their intimate affairs in impenetrable darkness even from the doctor so that the doctor finds it very difficult to form a proper picture of the patients psychology In such cases I am greatly assisted by the association experiment When the experiment is finished I first look over the general course of the reaction times I see a great many very pro longed times which in itself means that the patient can only adjust himself with difficulty that his psychological functions proceed with marked internal frictions with resistances By far the greater number of neurotics react only under great and hence very distinct resistances there are however cases in which the average reaction times are as short as in the normal and in whom the other complex indicators are lacking but who despite that fact undoubtedly present neurotic symptoms These rare cases are especially found among very intelligent1 1t 31  1 I i  I          fi I i i II 10 i i I iit i 14 1114 Lf iI fijIiji ii ii i ij l i fii iiiiitii i i i jii ii i  iii fiiiiiiiiiii iiii iiiii

practice have learned to control their outward behavior and therefore outwardly display very little if anything of their neuroses On superficial observation they can be taken as normal yet in some places they show disturbances which betray the repressed complex After examining the reaction times I turn my attention to the type of the association to ascertain with what type I am dealing If it is a predicate type I draw the conclusions which I have detailed above if it is a complex type I try to ascertain the nature of the complex With the necessary experience one can readily emancipate himself from the test persons state ments and almost without any previous knowledge of the test persons it is possible under certain circumstances to read the most intimate complexes from the results of the experiment I at first look for the reproduction words and put them to gether and I then look for the stimulus words which show the greatest disturbances In many cases a mere assortment of these words suffices to show the complex In some cases it is necessary to put a question here and there It will be best to illustrate this with a concrete example It concerns an educated woman of 30 years who has been married for three years After her marriage she suffers from episodic excitements in which she is violently jealous of her hus band The marriage is a happy one in every other respect and it should be noted that the husband gives no cause for the jealousy The patient is sure that she loves him and that her excited states are groundless She cannot imagine whence these excited states originate and feels quite perplexed over them It is to be noted that the patient is a catholic and has been brought up religiously while her husband is a protestant This difference of religion did not admittedly play any part A more thorough anamnesis showed the existence of an extreme prudishness Thus for example no one was allowed to talk in the patients presence about her sisters childbirth because the sexual moment suggested therein caused her the greatest excitement She always undressed in the adjoining room and never in her husbands presence etc At the age of 27 she was supposed to have had no idea how children were born The associations gave the results shown in the accompanying chart The blue columns represent failures of reproductions the green ones represent repetitions of stimulus words and the yellow columns show those associations in which the patient either laughed or made mistakes using many instead of one word The height of the columns represent the length of the reaction time240 JUNG The stimulus words characterized by marked disturbances are the following yellow to pray to separate to marry to quarrel old family happiness false fear to kiss bride to choose contented The strongest disturbances are found in the following stimulus words to pray to marry happiness false fear and contented These words therefore seemingly strike the complex above all The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that she is not indifferent to the fact that her husband is a protestant for she again thinks of praying that there is something wrong with marriage that she is false that is she entertains fancies of faithlessness she is afraid of the husband  of the future  she is not contented with her choice to choose and she thinks of separation The patient therefore has a separation complex for she is very discontented with her married life When I told her this result she was affected and at first attempted to deny it then to mince over it but finally she admitted everything I said and added still more She reproduced a large number of fancies of faithless ness reproaches against her husband etc Her prudishness and jealousy were merely a projection of her own sexual wishes on her husband Because she was faithless in her fancies and did not admit it to herself she was jealous of her husband It is impossible in a lecture to give a review of all the possi ble uses of the association experiment I must consent myself with having demonstrated to you at least some of its chief uses LECTURE II TH FAMILIAR CONSTELLATIONS Ladies and Gentlemen As you have seen there are mani fold ways in which the association experiment may be em ployed in practical psychology I should like to speak to you today about another utilization of this experiment which is primarily of only theoretical significance My pupil Miss Fiirst M D has made the following research she has applied the association experiment to 24 families consisting altogether of ioo test persons the resulting material amounted to 2200 associations This material was elaborated in the following manner Fifteen separate groups were formed according to logicallinguistic standards and the associations were arranged as follows Husband Wife Difference I Coordination 65 05 6 II Sub and supraordination 7  7 III Contrast    IV Predicate expressing a personal judgment 85 95 865 V Simple

1I5 Average difference 15 As can be seen from this example I utilize the difference to show the degree of the analogy In order to find a base for the total resemblance I have calculated the differences among all of Miss Fiirsts test persons not related among themselves by comparing every female test person with all the other un related females the same has been done for the male test persons The most marked difference is found in those cases where the two test persons compared have no associative quality in common All the groups are calculated in percentages the greatest difference possible being 133  I The average difference of male unrelated test persons is 59 and that of females of the same group is 6 II The average difference between male related test per sons is 4 i and that between female related test persons is 38 From these numbers we see that relatives show a tendency to agreement in the reaction type III Difference between fathers and children 42  I mothers    35 The reaction types of children come nearer to the type of the mother than to the father IV Difference between fathers and their sons  3 1      daughters 49   mothers   sons  47      daughters  3o V Difference between brothers 47 1 1  sisters  51 If the married sisters are omitted from the comparison we get the following result Difference of unmarried sisters  38 These observations show distinctly that marriage destroys more or less the original agreement as the husband belongs to a different type The difference between unmarried brothers  48242 JUNG Marriage seems to exert no influence on the association forms in man Nevertheless the material which we have at our disposal is not as yet enough to allow us to draw definite conclusions VI The difference between husband and wife 47 This number however sums up very inadequately the differ ent values that is there are some cases which show a marked difference and some which show a marked agreement The description in curves of the different results follows In the curves here reproduced I have marked above the number of associations of each quality in percentages The Roman letters written below the

ASSOCIATION METHOD 245 Stimulus word Mother Daughter burn great pain painful door wide big hay dry dry month many days 31 days air cool moist coal sooty black fruit sweet sweet merry happy child child One might indeed think that in this experiment where full scope is given to chance individuality would become a factor of the utmost importance and that therefore one might expect a very great diversity and lawlessness of associations But as we see the opposite is the case Thus the daughter lives con tently in the same circle of ideas as her mother not only in her thought but in her form of expression indeed she even uses the same words What seems more flighty more incon stant and more lawless than a fancy a rapidly passing thought  It is not however lawless and not free but closely determined within the limits of the milieu If therefore even the super ficial and manifestly most flighty formations of the intellect are altogether subject to the milieuconstellation what should we expect for the more important conditions of the mind for the emotions wishes hopes and intentions Let us consider a concrete examplethe curve A See above The mother is 45 years old and the daughter 16 years Both have a very distinct predicate type expressing personal judg ment and differ from the father in the most striking manner The father is a drunkard and a demoralized creature We can thus readily understand that his wife perceives an emo tional voidness which she naturally betrays by her enhanced predicate type The same causes cannot however operate in the daughter for in the first place she is not married to a drunkard and secondly life with all its hopes still lies before her It is distinctly unnatural for the daughter to show an ex treme predicate type expressing personal judgment She re sponds to the stimuli of the environment just like her mother But whereas in the mother the formation is in a way a natural consequence of her unhappy condition of life this condition is entirely lacking in the daughter The daughter simply imi tates the mother she merely appears like the mother Let us consider what this can signify for a young girl If a young girl reacts to the world like an old woman disappointed in life this at once shows unnaturalness and constraint But more serious consequences are possible As you know the predicate type is a manifestation of intensive emotions emotions are always involved Thus we cannot prevent ourselves from answering at least inwardly to the feelings and passions of our JOURNALI5246 JUNG nearest environment we allow ourselves to be infected and carried away by it Originally the affects and their physical manifestations had a biological significance i e they were a protective mechanism for the individual and the whole herd If we manifest emotions we can with certainty expect to receive emotions in return That is the sense of the predicate type What the 45yearold woman lacks in emotions i e in love in her marriage relations she seeks to obtain from the outside and it is for that reason that she is an ardent participant in the Christian Science meetings If the daughter imitates this sit uation she does the same thing as her mother she seeks to obtain emotions from the outside But for a girl of 16 such an emotional state is to say the least quite dangerous like her mother she reacts to her environment as a sufferer soliciting sympathy Such an emotional state is no longer dangerous in the mother but for obvious reasons it is quite dangerous in the daughter Once freed from her father and mother she will be like her mother i e she will be a suffering woman craving for inner gratification She will thus be exposed to the great est danger of falling a victim to brutality and of marrying a brute and inebriate like her father This consideration seems to me to be of importance for the conception of the influence of environment and education The example shows what passes over from the mother to the child It is not the good and pious precepts nor is it any other inculcation of pedagogic truths that have a moulding influence upon the character of the developing child but what most in fluences him is the peculiarly affective state which is totally unknown to his parents and educators The concealed discord between the parents the secret worry the repressed hidden wishes all these produce in the individual a certain affective state with its objective signs which slowly but surely though unconsciously works its way into the childs mind producing therein the same conditions and hence the same reactions to external stimuli We know that association with mournful and melancholic persons will depress us too A restless and nervous individual infects his surroundings with unrest and dissatisfaction a grumbler with his discontent etc If grown up persons are so sensitive to such surrounding influences we certainly ought to expect more of this in the child whose mind is as soft and plastic as wax The father and mother impress deeply into the childs mind the seal of their personality the more sensitive and mouldable the child the deeper is the im pression Thus even things that are never spoken about are reflected in the child The child imitates the gesture and just as the gesture of the parent is the expression of an emotional state so in turn the gesture gradually produces in the child aTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 247 similar feeling as it feels itself so to speak into the gesture Just as the parents adapt themselves to the world so does the child At the age of puberty when it begins to free itself from the spell of the family it enters into life with so to say a sur face of fracture entirely in keeping with that of the father and mother The frequent and often very deep depressions of pu berty emanate from this they are symptoms which are rooted in the difficulty of new adjustment The youthful person at first tries to separate himself as much as possible from his family he may even estrange himself from it but inwardly this only ties him the more firmly to the parental image I recall the case of a young neurotic who ran away from his parents he was strange and almost hostile to them but he admitted to me that he possessed a special sanctum it was a strong box containing his old childhood books old dried flowers stones and even small bottles of water from the well at his home and from a river along which he walked with his parents etc The first attempts to assume friendship and love are con stellated in the strongest manner possible by the relation to parents and here one can usually observe how powerful are the influences of the familiar constellations It is not rare e g for a healthy man whose mother was hysterical to marry a hysterical or for the daughter of an alcoholic to choose an alcoholic for her husband I was once consulted by an intel ligent and educated young woman of 26 who suffered from a peculiar symptom She thought that her eyes now and then took on a strange expression which exerted a disagreeable in fluence on men If she then looked at a gentleman he became embarrassed turned away and said something rapidly to his neighbor at which both were either embarrassed or inclined to laugh The patient was convinced that her look excited in decent thoughts in the men It was impossible to convince her of the falsity of her conviction This symptom immediately aroused in me the suspicion that I dealt with a case of paranoia rather than with a neurosis But as was shown only three days later by the further course of the treatment I was mis taken for the symptom promptly disappeared after it had been explained by analysis It originated in the following manner The lady had a lover who deserted her in a very striking manner She felt utterly forsaken she withdrew from all society and pleas ure and entertained suicidal ideas In her seclusion there accu mulated unadmitted and repressed erotic wishes which she unconsciously projected on men whenever she was in their company This gave rise to her conviction that her look excited erotic wishes in men Further investigation showed that her deserting lover was alunatic which she did not apparently ob serve I expressed my surprise at her unsuitable choice and added248 JUNG that she must have had a certain predilection for loving mentally abnormal persons This she denied stating that she had once before been engaged to be married to a normal man He too deserted her and on further investigation it was found that be too had been in an insane asylum shortly beforeanother luna tic This seemed to me to confirm with sufficient certainty my belief that she had an unconscious tendency to choose insane persons Whence originated this strange taste Her father was an eccentric character and in later years entirely estranged from his family Her whole love had therefore been turned away from her father to a brother 8 years her senior him she loved and hon ored as a father and this brother became hopelessly insane at the age of 14 That was apparently the model from which the pa tient could never free herself after which she chose her lovers and through which she had to become unhappy Her neurosis which gave the impression of insanity probably originated from this infantile model We must take into consideration that we are dealing in this case with a highly educated and intelligent lady who did not pass carelessly over her mental experiences who indeed reflected much over her unhappiness without however having any idea whence her misfortune originated These are things which inwardly appeal to us as matter of course and it is for this reason that we do not see them but attribute everything to the socalled congenital character I could cite any number of examples of this kind Every patient furnishes contributions to this subject of the determi nation of destiny through the influence of the familiar milieus In every neurotic we see how the constellation of the infantile milieu influences not only the character of the neurosis but also lifes destiny in its very details Numberless unhappy choices of profession and matrimonial failures can be traced to this constellation There are however cases where the profession has been happily chosen where the husband or wife leaves nothing to be desired and where still the person does not feel well but works and lives under constant diffi culties Such cases often appear in the guise of chronic neurasthenia Here the difficulty is due to the fact that the mind is unconsciously split into two parts of divergent ten dencies which are impeding each other one part lives with the husband or with the profession while the other lives un consciously in the past with the father or mother I have treated a lady who after suffering many years from a severe neurosis merged into a dementia praecox The neurotic affection began with her marriage This ladys husband was kind educated well to do and in every respect suitable for her his character showed nothing that would in any way inTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 249 terfere with a happy marriage Despite that the marriage was an unhappy one merely because the wife was neurotic and therefore prevented all congenial companionship The important heuristic axiom of every psychanalysis reads as follows If a neurosis springs up in a person this neurosis ontains the counterargument against the relationship of the catient to the personality with which he is most intimately con nected If the husband has a neurosis the neurosis thus loudly proclaims that he has intensive resistances and contrary tendencies against his wife and if the wife has a neurosis the wife has a tendency which diverges from her husband If the person is unmarried the neurosis is then directed against the lover or the sweetheart or against the parents Every neu rotic naturally strives against this relentless formulation of the content of his neurosis and he often refuses to recognize it at any cost but still it is always justified To be sure the con flict is not on the surface but must generally be revealed through a painstaking psychanalysis The history of our patient reads as follows The father had a powerful personality She was his favorite daughter and entertained for him a boundless veneration At the age of 17 she for the first time fell in love with a young man At that time she had twice the same dream the im pression of which never left her in all her later years she even imputed to it a mystic significance and often recalled it with religious dread In the dream she saw a tall masculine figure with a very beautiful white beard at this sight she was permeated with a feeling of awe and delight as if she ex perienced the presence of God himself This dream made the deepest impression on her and she was constrained to think of it again and again The love affair of that period proved to be one of little warmth and was soon given up Later the patient married her present husband Though she loved her hus band she was led continually to compare him with her deceased father this comparison always proved unfavorable to her hus band Whatever the husband said intended or did was subjected to this standard and always with the same result  My father would have done all this better and differently Our patients life with her husband was not happy she could neither respect nor love him sufficiently she was inwardly dissatisfied and unsatiated She gradually evinced a fervent piety and at the same time there appeared a violent hysteri cal affection She began by going into raptures now over this and now over that clergyman she was looking everywhere for a spiritual friend and estranged herself more and more from her husband The mental trouble made itself manifest after about a decade In her diseased state she refused to have250 JUNG anything to do with her husband and child she imagined herself pregnant by another man In brief the resistances against her husband which hitherto had been laboriously re pressed came out quite openly and among other things mani fested themselves in insults of the gravest kind directed against her husband In this case we see how a neurosis appeared as it were at the moment of marriage i e this neurosis expresses the coun terargument against the husband What is the counterargu ment  The counterargument is the father of the patient for she verified daily her belief that her husband was not equal to her father When the patient first fell in love there also ap peared a symptom in the form of a very impressive visionary dream She saw the man with the very beautiful white beard Who was this man On directing her attention to the beautiful white beard she immediately recognized the phantom It was of course her father Thus every time the patient merged into a love affair the picture of the father in opportunely appeared and prevented her from adjusting her self psychologically to her husband I purposely chose this case as an illustration because it is simple obvious and quite typical of many marriages which are crippled through the neurosis of the wife The unhappi ness always lies in a too firm attachment to the parents The offspring remains in the infantile relations We can find here one of the most important tasks of pedagogy namely the solution of the problem how to free the growing individual from his unconscious attachments to the influences of the in fantile milieu in such a manner that he may retain whatever there is in it that is suitable and reject whatever is unsuitable To solve this difficult question on the part of the child seems to me impossible at present We know as yet too little about the childs emotional processes The first and only real con tribution to the literature on this subject has in fact appeared during the present year It is the analysis of a fiveyearold boy published by Freud The difficulties on the part of the child are very great They should not however be so great on the part of the parents In many ways the parents could manage more care fully and more indulgently the love of children The sins committed against favorite children by the undue love of the parents could perhaps be avoided through a wider knowledge of the childs mind For many reasons I find it impossible to tell you anything of general validity concerning the bringing up of children as it is affected by this problem We are as yet very far from general prescriptions and rules are still in the realm of casuistry Unfortunately our knowledge of the finerTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 251 mental processes in the child is so meagre that we are after all not in any position to say where the greater trouble lies whether in the parents in the child or in the conception of the milieu Only psychanalyses of the kind that Professor Freud has published in our Jahrbuch 1909 will help us out of this difficulty Such comprehensive and profound observations should act as a strong inducement to all teachers to occupy themselves with Freuds psychology This psychology offers more for practical pedagogy than the physiological psychology of the present LECTURE III EXPERIENCES CONCERNING THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD Ladies and Gentlemen In the last lecture we have seen how important for later life are the emotional processes of childhood In todays lecture I should like to give you some insight into the psychic life of the child through the analysis of a 4yearold girl It is much to be regretted that there are doubtless few among you who have had opportunity to read the analysis of  Little John Kleiner Hans which has been published by Freud during the current year I should prop erly begin by giving you the content of that analysis so that you might be in a position to compare for yourselves the results of Freud with those obtained by me and to observe the marked even astonishing similarity between the unconscious creations of the two children Without a knowledge of the funda mental analysis of Freud much in the report of the following case will appear to you strange incomprehensible and per haps unacceptable I beg you however to defer final judg ment and to enter upon the consideration of these new subjects with a kindly disposition for such pioneer work in virgin soil requires not only the greatest patience on the part of the in vestigator but also the unprejudiced attention of his audience Because the Freudian investigations apparently involve an indelicate discussion of the most intimate secrets of sexuality many people have had a feeling of repulsion and have there fore rejected everything as a matter of course without any real proof This unfortunately has almost always been the fate of Frends doctrines until now One must not come to the consideration of these matters with the firm conviction that they do not exist else it may easily come to pass that for the prejudiced they really do not exist One should perhaps for the moment assume the authors point of view and investigate these phenomena under his guidance In this way only can 1Jahrbuch f Psychoanalytische und Psychopathologische For schungen Band I Deuticke Wien252 JUNG the correctness or incorrectness of our observations be affirmed We may err as all human beings err But the continual holding up to us of our mistakesperhaps they are worse than mistakesdoes not help us to see things more distinctly We should prefer to see wherein we err That should be shown to us in our own sphere of experience Thus far how ever no one has succeeded in meeting us on our own ground and in giving us a different conception of the things which we ourselves see We must still complain that our critics are per sisting in complete ignorance and without the slightest notion about the matters in question The only reason for this is that our critics have never taken the trouble to become thor oughly acquainted with our method had they done this they would have understood us The little girl to whose sagacity and intellectual vivacity we are indebted for the following observations is a healthy lively child of emotional temperament She has never been seriously ill and never even in the realm of the nervous system had there been observed any symptoms prior to this investigation In the report which will now follow we shall have to waive a connected description for it is made up of anecdotes which treat of one out of a whole cycle of similar experiences and which cannot therefore be arranged scientifically and sys tematically but must rather be described somewhat in the form of a story This manner of description we cannot as yet dispense with in our analytic psychology for we are still far from being able in all cases to separate with unerring certainty the curious from the typical When the little daughter whom we will call Anna was about 3 years old she once had the following conversation with her grandmother Anna Grandma why have you such withered eyes Grandma Because I am old A But you will become young again G No do you know I shall become older and older and then I shall die A Well and then G Then I shall become an angel A And then will you again become a little child  The child found here a welcome opportunity for the provi sional solution of a problem For some time before she had been in the habit of asking her mother whether she would ever have a living doll a little child a little brother This nat urally included the question as to the origin of children As such questions appeared only spontaneously and indirectly the parents attached no significance to them but receivedTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 253 them as lightly and in appearance as facetiously as the child seemed to ask them Thus she once received from her father the amusing information that children are brought by the stork Anna had already heard somewhere a more serious version namely that children are little angels living in heaven and are brought from heaven by the stork This theory seems to have become the starting point for the investigating activ ity of the little one From the conversation with the grand mother it could be seen that this theory was capable of wide application namely it not only solved in a comforting manner the painful idea of parting and dying but at the same time it solved satisfactorily the riddle of the origin of children Such solutions which kill at least two birds with one stone were formerly tenaciously adhered to in science and even in the child they cannot be made retrograde without some shock Just as was the birth of a little sister the turning point in the history of little John  so it was in this case the birth of a brother which happened when Anna had reached the age of 4 years The pregnancy of the mother apparently remained unnoticed i e the child never expressed herself on this subject On the evening before the childbirth when the labor pains began to manifest themselves in the mother the child was in her fathers room He took her on his knee and said Tell me what would you say if you should get a little brother tonight  I would kill it was the prompt answer The expression to kill looks very serious but in reality it is quite harmless for to kill and to die in child language signify only to remove either in the active or in the passive sense as has already been pointed out a number of times by Freud To kill as used by the child is a harmless word especially so when we know that the child uses the word kill quite promiscuously for all possible kinds of destruction re moval demolition etc It is nevertheless worth while to note this tendency see the analysis of Kleiner Hans p 5 The childbirth occurred early in the morning in the presence of a physician and a midwife When all remnants of the birth including some blood traces were cleaned up the father entered the room where the little one slept She awoke as he entered He imparted to her the news of the advent of a little brother which she took with surprise and strained facial ex pression The father took her in his arms and carried her into the confinement chamber She first threw a rapid glance at her somewhat pale mother and then displayed something like a mixture of despair and suspicion as if thinking Now what else is going to happen Fathers impression She displayed hardly any pleasure at the sight of the new arrival so that the cool reception she gave it caused general disappointment254 JUNG During the forenoon she kept very noticeably away from her mother this was the more striking as she was usually much attached to her mother But once when her mother was alone she ran into the room embraced her and said Well are nt you going to die now  This explains a part of the conflict in the childs psyche Though the stork theory was never really taken seriously she accepted the fruitful rebirth hypothesis according to which a person by dying assisted a child into life Accordingly the mother too must die why then should the newborn child against whom she already felt childish jealousy cause her pleasure It was for this reason that she had to ascertain in a favorable moment whether the mother was to die or rather was moved to express the hope that she would not die With this happy issue however the rebirth theory sustained a severe shock How was it possible now to explain the birth of her little brother and the origin of children in general There still remained the stork theory which though never expressly rejected had been implicitly waived through the assumption of the rebirth theory The explanations next at tempted unfortunately remained hidden from the parents as the child stayed a few weeks with her grandmother From the grandmothers report we learned that the stork theory was often discussed and it was naturally reenforced by the concur rence of those about her When Anna returned to her parents she again on meeting her mother evinced the same mixture of despair and suspicion which she had displayed after the birth The impression though inexplicable was quite unmistakable to both parents Her behavior towards the baby was very nice During her absence a nurse had come into the house who on account of her uniform made a deep impression on Anna to be sure the impression at first was quite unfavorable as she evinced the greatest hostility to her Thus nothing could induce her to allow herself to be undressed and put to sleep by this nurse Whence this resistance originated was soon shown in an angry scene near the cradle of the little brother in which Anna shouted at the nurse This is not your little brother it is mine  Gradually however she became reconciled to the nurse and began to play nurse herself she had to have her white cap and apron and  nursed  now her little brother and now her doll In contrast to her former mood she became unmistakably mournful and dreamy She often sat for a long time under the table singing and rhyming stories which were partially incom prehensible but sometimes contained the nurse theme I am a nurse of the green cross Some of the stories howTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 255 ever distinctly showed a painful feeling striving for expres sion Here we meet with a new and important feature in the little ones life that is we meet with reveries tendencies towards the composition of poetry and melancholic attacks All these things which we are wont first to encounter at a later period of life at a time when the youthful person is preparing to sever the family tie and to enter independently upon life but is still held back by an inward painful feeling of homesickness and the warmth of the parental hearth At that time the youth begins to replace his longing with poetic fancies in order to compensate for the deficiency To approximate the psychol ogy of a fouryearold child to that of the age of puberty will at first sight seem paradoxical the relationship lies however not in the age but rather in the mechanism The elegiac rev eries express the fact that a part of that love which formerly belonged and should belong to a real object is now introverted that is it is turned inward into the subject and there produces an increased imaginative activity What is the origin of this introversion Is it a psychological manifestation peculiar to this age or does it owe its origin to a conflict This is explained in the following occurrence It often hap pened that Anna was disobedient to her mother she was in solent saying I am going back to grandma Mother But I shall be sad when you leave me Anna Oh but you have the little brother The effect which this produced on the mother shows what the little one was really aiming at with her threats to go away again she apparently wished to hear what her mother would say to her proposal that is to see what attitude her mother would actually assume to her whether her little brother had not crowded her out altogether from her mothers favor One must however give no credence to this little trickster For the child could readily see and feel that despite the existence of the little brother there was nothing essentially lacking for her in her mothers love The reproach to which she subjects her mother is therefore unjustified and to the trained ear this is betrayed by a slightly affected tone Such a tone if unmis takable shows that it does not expect to be taken seriously and hence it obtrudes itself reenforced The reproach as such must also not have been taken seriously by the mother for it was only the forerunner of other and this time more serious resistances Not long after the previously reported conversa tion the following scene took place Mother Come we are going into the garden now  Anna You are lying take care if you are not telling the truth256 JUNG M What are you thinking of I always tell the truth A No you are not telling the truth M You will soon see that I am telling the truth we are going into the garden now A  Indeed is that true Is that really true Are you not lying Scenes of this kind were repeated a number of times This time the tone was more rude and more penetrating and at the same time the accent on the word lie  betrayed something special which the parents did not understand indeed at first they attributed too little significance to the spontaneous utter ances of the child In this they merely did what education usually does with official sanction One usually pays little heed to children in every stage of life in all essential matters they are treated as not responsible and in all unessential mat ters they are trained with an automatic precision Under resistances there always lies a question a conflict of which we hear at later times and on other occasions But usually one forgets to connect the thing heard with the resist ances Thus on another occasion Anna put to her mother the following difficult questions Anna  I should like to become a nurse when I grow big why did you not become a nurse Mother  Why as I have become a mother I have chil dren to nurse anyway A Reflecting Indeed shall I be a different woman from you and shall I still speak to you  The mothers answer again shows whither the childs ques tion was really directed Apparently Anna too would like to have a child to nurse just as the nurse has Where the nurse got the little child is quite clear Anna too could get a child in the same way if she were big Why did not the mother become such a plain nurse that is to say how did she get a child if not in the same way as the nurse Like the nurse Anna too could get a child but how that fact might be changed in the future or how she might come to resemble her mother in respect to getting children is not clear to her From this resulted the thoughtful question  Indeed shall I be a different woman from you Shall I be different in every respect The stork theory evidently had come to naught the dying theory met a similar fate hence she now thinks one may get a child in the same way as for example the nurse got hers She too could get one in this natural way but how about the mother who is no nurse and still has children Looking at the matter at this point of view Anna asks  Why did you not become a nurse namely  why have you not got your child in the natural way This peculiar indirectTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 257 manner of questioning is typical and evidently corresponds with the childs hazy grasp of the problem unless we assume a certain diplomatic uncertainty prompted by a desire to evade di rect questioning We shall later find an illustration of this possi bility Anna is evidently confronted with the question  where does the child come from  The stork did not bring it mother did not die nor did mother get it in the same way as the nurse She has however asked this question before and re ceived the information from her father that the stork brings children this is positively untrue she can never be deceived on this point Accordingly papa and mama and all the others lie This readily explains her suspicion at the childbirth and her discrediting of her mother But it also explains another point namely the elegiac reveries which we have attributed to a partial introversion We know now from what real ob ject love had to be taken and introverted to no purpose namely it had to be taken from the parents who deceived her and re fused to tell her the truth What must this be which cannot be uttered What is going on here Such were the paren thetic questions of the child and the answer was Evidently this must be something to be concealed perhaps something dangerous Attempts to make her talk and to draw out the truth by means of insidious questions were futile she ex erted resistance against resistance and the introversion of love began It is evident that the capacity for sublimation in a 4 yearold child is still too slightly developed to be capable of per forming more than symptomatic services The mind there fore depends on another compensation namely it resorts to one of the relinquished infantile devices for securing love by force the most preferred is that of crying and calling the mother at night This has been diligently practised and ex hausted during her first year It now returns and correspond ing to the period of life it has become well determined and equipped with recent impressions It was just after the earth quakes in Messina and this event was discussed at the table Anna was extremely interested in everything she repeatedly asked her grandma to relate to her how the earth shook how the houses were demolished and many people lost their lives After this she had nocturnal fears she could not remain alone her mother was forced to go to her and stay with her otherwise she feared that an earthquake would appear that the house would fall and kill her During the day too she was much occupied with such thoughts While walking with her mother she annoyed her with such questions as  Will the house be standing when we return home Are you sure there is no earthquake at home Will papa still be living About every stone lying in the road she asked whether it was from an258 JUNG earthquake A new building was a house destroyed by the earthquake etc She finally even cried out frequently at night that the earthquake was coming and that she heard the thun der In the evening she had to be solemnly assured that there was no earthquake coming Many means of calming her were tried thus she was told for example that earthquakes only exist where there are vol canoes But then she had to be satisfied that the mountains surrounding the city were not volcanoes This reasoning gradually caused in the child an eager desire for learning strong but quite unnatural for her age which manifested itself in her requiring that all the geological atlases and textbooks should be brought her from her fathers library For hours she rummaged through these works looking for pictures of volcanoes and earthquakes and asking questions continually We are here confronted by an energetic effort to sublimate the fear into an eager desire for learning which at this age made a decidedly premature exaction but as in many a gifted child which suffers from precisely the same difficulty many effects of this immature sublimation were surely not to her advantage For by favoring sublimation at this age one merely enforces a fragment of neurosis The root of the eager desire for learning is the fear and the fear is the expression of a converted libido that is it is the expression of an introversion which henceforth becomes neurotic which at this age is neither necessary nor favor able for the development of the child Whither this eager desire for learning was ultimately directed is explained by a series of questions which arose almost daily Why is Sophie a younger sister younger than I Where was Freddy the little brother before Was he in heaven What was he doing there Why did he come down just now why not before This state of affairs induced the father to decide that the mother should tell the child when occasion offered the truth concerning the origin of the little brother This having been done Anna soon thereafter asked about the stork Her mother told her that the story of the stork was not true but that Freddy grew up in his mother like the flowers in a plant At first he was very little and then he became bigger and bigger just like a plant She listened attentively without the slightest surprise and then asked But did he come out all by himself Mother Yes Anna But he cannot walk  Sophie Then he crawled out Anna overhearing her little sisters answerIs there a hole here pointing to the breast or did he come out of the mouth Who came out of the nurse  She then interruptedTHEC ASSOCIATION METHOD 259 herself and exclaimed No no the stork brought little brother down from heaven She soon left the subject and again wished to see pictures of volcanoes During the evening fol lowing this conversation she was calm The sudden explana tion produced in the child a whole series of ideas which manifested themselves in certain questions Unexpected per spectives were opened she rapidly approached the main problem namely the question  Where did the child come out Was it from a hole in the breast or from the mouthk Both suppositions are entirely qualified to form acceptable theories We even meet with recently married women who still entertain the theory of the hole in the abdominal wall or of the Caesarean section this is supposed to betray a very curious form of innocence But as a matter of fact it is not innocence as we are always dealing in such cases with infantile sexual activities which in later life have brought the vias naturales into ill repute It may be asked where the child got the absurd idea that there is a hole in the breast or that the birth takes place through the mouth Why did she not select one of the natural openings existing in the abdomen from which things come out daily The explanation is simple Very shortly before our little one had invited some educational criticism on her mothers part by a heightened interest in both abdominal openings with their remarkable productsan interest not always in accord with the requirements of cleanliness and decorum Then for the first time she became acquainted with the exceptional laws of these bodily regions and being a sensitive child she soon learned that there was something here to be tabooed This region therefore must not be referred to Anna had simply shown herself docile and had so adjusted herself to the cultural demands that she thought at least spoke of the simplest things last The incorrect theories substituted for correct laws persisted for years until brusque explanations came from with out It is therefore no wonder that such theories the forming of and adherence to which are favored even by parents and educators should later become determinants of important symp toms in a neurosis or of delusions in a psychosis just as I have shown that in dementia praecoxl what has existed in the mind for years always remains somewhere though it may be hidden under compensations seemingly of a different kind But even before this question whence the child really comes out was settled a new problem obtruded itself viz the chil dren come out of the mother but how is it with the nurse 1Jung The Psychology of Dementia Praecox translated by Peter son and Brill Journal of Nervous and MIental Diseases Monograph Series No 3260 JUNG Did some one come out also in this case This question was followed by the remark No no the stork brought down the little brother from heaven What is there peculiar about the fact that nobody came out of the nurse We recall that Anna identified herself with the nurse and planned to become a nurse later forshe too would like to have a child and she could have one as well as the nurse But now when it is known that the little brother grew in mama how is it now This disquieting question is averted by a quick return to the storkangel theory which has never been really believed and which after a few trials is at last definitely abandoned Two questions however remain in the air The first reads as fol lows Where does the child come out  The second a consid erably more difficult one reads How does it happen that mama has children while the nurse and the servants do not All these questions did not at first manifest themselves On the day following the explanation while at dinner Anna spontaneously remarked My brother is in Italy and has a house of cloth and glass but it does not tumble down In this case as in the others it was impossible to ask for an explanation the resistances were too great and Anna could not be drawn into conversation This former officious and pretty explanation is very significant For some three months the two sisters had been building a stereotyped fanciful conception of a big brother This brother knows everything he can do and has everything he has been and is in every place where the children are not he is owner of great cows oxen horses dogs everthing is his etc Each sister has such a big brother We must not look far for the origin of this fancy the model for it is the father who seems to correspond to this conception he seems to be like a brother to mama The children too have their similar powerful brother This brother is very brave he is at present in dangerous Italy and inhabits an impossible fragile house and it does not tumble down For the child this realizes an important wish The earthquake is no longer to be dangerous As a consequence of this the childs fear disap peared and stayed away The fear of earthquakes now entirely vanished Instead of calling her father to her bed to conjure away the fear she now became very affectionate and begged him every night to kiss her In order to test this new state of affairs the father showed her pictures illustrating volcanoes and earthquake devastations Anna remained unaffected she examined the pictures with in difference remarking These people are dead I have already seen that quite often The picture of a volcanic eruption no longer had any attraction for her Thus all her scientific in terest collapsed and vanished as suddenly as it came DuringTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 261 the days following the explanation Anna had quite important matters to occupy herself with she disseminated her newly acquired knowledge amoihg those about her in the following manner She began by again circumstantially af firming what had been told her viz that Freddy she and her younger sister had grown in her mother that papa and mama grew in their mothers and that the servants likewise grew in their respective mothers By frequent questions she tested the true basis of her knowledge for her suspicion was aroused in no small measure so that it needed many confirma tions to remove all her uncertainties On one occasion the trustworthiness of the theory threatened to go to pieces About a week after the explanation the father was taken sick with influenza and consequently had to remain in bed during the forenoon The children knew nothing about this and Anna coming into the parents bedroom saw what was quite unusual namely that her father was remaining in bed She again took on a peculiar surprised expression she re mained at a distance from the bed and would not come nearer she was apparently again reserved and suspicious But sud denly she burst out with the question  Why are you in bed have you a plant in your belly too  The father was naturally forced to laugh He calmed her however by assuring her that children never grow in the father that only women can have children and not men thereupon the child again became friendly But though the surface was calm the problems continued to work in the dark A few days later while at dinner Anna related the following dream I dreamed last night of Noahs ark The father then asked her what she had dreamed about it but Annas answer was sheer nonsense In such cases it is necessary only to wait and pay attention A few minutes later she said to her mother I dreamed last night about Noahs ark and there were a lot of little animals in it Another pause She then began her story for the third time Idreamed last night about Noahs ark and there were a lot of little animals in it and un derneath there was a lid and that opened and all the little animals fell out The children really had a Noahs ark but its opening a lid was on the roof and not underneath In this way she deli cately intimated that the story of the birth from mouth or breast is incorrect and that she had some inkling where the children came out A few weeks then passed without any noteworthy occur rences On one occasion she related the following dream  I dreamed about papa and mama they had been sitting late in the study and we children were there too On the face of JOURNAI6262 JUNG this we find a wish of the children to be allowed to sit up as long as the parents This wish is here realized or rather it is util ized to express a more important wish namely to be present in the evening when the parents are alone of course quite inno cently it was in the study where she has seen all the interesting books and where she has satiated her thirst for knowledge i e she was really seeking an answer to the burning question whence the little brother came If the children were there they would find out A few days later Anna had a terrifying dream from which she awoke crying The earthquake was coming the house had begun to shake Her mother went to her and calmed her by saying that the earthquake was not coming that everything was quiet and that everybody was asleep Whereupon Anna said I would like to see the spring when all the little flowers are coming out and the whole lawn is full of flowers1 would like to see Freddy he has such a dear little face What is papa doing What is he saying The mother said He is asleep and is nt saying anything now Little Anna then remarked with a sarcastic smile He will surely be sick again in the morning This text should be read backwards The last sentence was not meant seriously as it was uttered in a mocking tone When the father was sick the last time Anna suspected that he had a  plant in his belly The sarcasm signifies  Tomor row papa is surely going to have a child But this also is not meant seriously Papa is not going to have a child mama alone has children perhaps she will have another child to morrow but where from  What does papa do  The form ulation of the difficult problem seems here to come to the surface It reads What does papa really do if he does not bear children  The little one is very anxious to have a solution for all these problems she woyld like to know how Freddy came into the world she would like to see how the little flow ers come out of the earth in the spring and these wishes are hidden behind the fear of earthquakes After this intermezzo Anna slept quietly until morning In the morning her mother asked her what she had dreamed She did not at first recall anything and then said I dreamed that I could make the summer and then some one threw a Punch down into the closet This peculiar dream apparently has two different scenes which are separated by then The second part draws its material from the recent wish to possess a Punch that is to 1This wish to sit up with the father and mother until late at night often plays a great part later in a neurosis Its object is to prevent the parental coitus 2A doll from Punch and JudyTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 263 have a masculine doll just as the mother has a little boy Some one threw Punch down into the closet one often lets other things fall down into the water closet It is just like this that tke children too come out We have here an analogy to the Lumpftheory of little John Whenever several scenes are found in one dream each scene ordinarily represents a particular variation of the complex elaboration Here accord ingly the first part is only a variation of the theme found in the second part The meaning of to see the spring or to see the little flowers come out we have already seen Anna now dreams that she can make the summer that is she can bring it about that the little flowers shall come out She herself can make a little child and the second part of the dream represents this just like a passage of the bowels Here we find the ego tistic wish which is behind the seemingly objective interest of the nocturnal conversation A few days later the mother was visited by a lady who ex pected soon to become a mother The children seemed to take no interest in the matter but the next day they amused them selves with the following play which was directed by the older one they took all the newspapers they could find in their fathers paperbasket and stuffed them under their clothes so that the intention of the imitation was quite plain During the night little Anna had another dream I dreamed about a woman in the city she had a very big belly The chief actor in the dream is always the dreamer himself under some definite aspect thus the childish play of the day before is fully solved Not long thereafter Anna surprised her mother with the fol lowing performance She stuck her doll under her clothes then pulled it out slowly head downwards and at the same time remarked Look the little child is coming out it is now all out By this means Anna tells her mother You see thus I appre hend the problem of birth What do you think of it Is that right  The play is really meant to be a question for as we shall see later this conception had to be officially confirmed That rumination on this problem by no means ended here is shown by the occasional ideas conceived during the following weeks Thus she repeated the same play a few days later with her Teddy Bear which functioned as an especially loving doll One day looking at a rose she said to her grandma See the rose is getting a baby As her grandma did not quite under stand her she pointed to the enlarged calyx and said You see she is quite thick here Anna once quarrelled with her younger sister and the latter See analysis of a 5yearold boy Jahrbuch f Psychoanalytische u Psychopathologische Forschungen Vol I264 JUNG angrily exclaimed I will kill you Whereupon Anna an swered When I am dead you will be all alone then you will have to pray to the dear Lord for a live baby But the scene soon changed Anna was the angel and the younger sister was forced to kneel before her and pray to her that she should present to her a living child In this way Anna be came the presenting mother Oranges were once served on the table Anna impatiently asked for one and said I am going to take an orange and swallow it all down into my belly and then I shall get a little child Who will not think here of the fairy tales in which childless women finally become pregnant by swallowing fruit fish and similar things Thus Anna attempts to solve the problem how the children actually come into the mother She thus enters into an examination which hitherto has not been formulated with so much sharpness The solution follows in the form of an analogy which is quite characteristic of the archaic thinking of the child In the adult too there is a kind of thinking by analogy which belongs to the stratum lying immediately below consciousness Dreams bring the analogies to the surface the same may be observed also in dementia pracox In German as well as in numerous foreign fairy tales one frequently finds such characteristic childish comparisons Fairy tales seem to be the myths of the child and therefore contain among other things the mythology which the child weaves concerning the sexual processes The spell of the fairy tale poetry which is felt even by the adult is ex plained by the fact that some of the old theories are still alive in our unconscious minds We experience a strange peculiar and familiar feeling when a conception of our remotest youth is again stimulated Without becoming conscious it merely sends into consciousness a feeble copy of its original emotional strength The problem how the child gets into the mother was difficult to solve As the only way of taking things into the body is through the mouth it could evidently be assumed that the mother eats something like a fruit which then grows in her belly But then comes another difficulty namely it is clear enough what the mother produces but it is not yet clear what the father is good for What does the father do  Anna now occupied herself ex clusively with this question One morning she ran into the parents bedroom while they were dressing she jumped into her fathers bed she lay down on her belly and kicked with her legs and called at the same time Look does papa do 1 Franz RiklinTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 265 that i The analogy to the horse of little John which raised such disturbance with its legs is very surprising With this last performance the solving of the problem seemed to rest entirely at least the parents found no oppor tunity to make any pertinent observations That the problem should come to a standstill just here is not at all surprising for this is really its most difficult part Moreover we know from experience that not very many children go beyond these limits during the period of childhood The problem is almost too difficult for the childish reason which still lacks much irre missible knowledge without which the problem cannot be solved This standstill lasted about five months during which no phobias or other signs of complex elaboration appeared After the lapse of this time there appeared premonitory signs of some new incidents Annas family lived at that time in the country near a lake where the mother and children could bathe As Anna feared to wade farther into the water than kneedeep her father once put her into the water which led to an outburst of crying In the evening while going to bed Anna asked her mother Do you not believe that father wanted to drown me A few days later there was another outburst of crying She continued to stand in the gardeners way until he finally placed her in a newly dug hole Anna cried bitterly and afterwards maintained that the gardener wished to bury her To finish up with Anna awoke during the night with fearful crying Her mother went to her in the adjoining room and quieted her Anna dreamed that a train passed and then fell in a heap We have here repeated the stage coach of little John These incidents showed clearly enough that there was again fear in the air i e that there again had arisen a resistance against the transposition on the parents and that therefore a larger part of the love was converted into fear This time sus picion was directed not against the mother but against the father who she was sure must know the secret but would never let anything out What could the father be secreting or doing To the child this secret appeared as something dan gerous so that she felt the worst might be expected from the father This feeling of childish anxiety with the father as object we see again most distinctly in adults especially in de mentia prnecox which lifts the veil of obscurity from many unconscious processes as though it were following psych analytic principles It was for this reason that Anna appar ently came to the very absurd conclusion that her father wanted to drown her At the same time her fear contained the thought that the object of the father had some relation to a dangerous266 JUNG action This stream of thought is no arbitrary interpretation Anna meanwhile grew up a little and her interest for her father took on a special coloring which is hard to describe Lan guage possesses no words to describe the very special kind of affectionate curiosity which radiated from the childs eyes Anna once took marked delight in assisting the gardener while he was sowing grass without apparently divining the profound significance of the childs play About a fortnight later she began to observe with great pleasure the sprouting young grass On one of these occasions she asked her mother the following question Tell me how did the eyes grow into the head The mother told her that she did not know Anna however continued to ask whether the Lord or her papa could tell this The mother then referred her to the father who might tell her how the eyes grew into the head A few days later there was a family reunion at a tea and after everything was over the guests departed The father remained at the table reading the paper and Anna also remained Sud denly approaching her father she said Tell me how did the eyes grow into the head Father They did not grow into the head they were there from the beginning and grew with the head A Were not the eyes planted F No they grew in the head like the nose A Did the mouth and the ears grow in the same way  and the hair too F Yes they all grew in the same way A And the hair too But the mousies came into the world naked Where was the hair before Were there no seeds added  F No you see the hair really came out of little grains which are like seeds but these were already in the skin long before and nobody sowed them The father was now getting concerned he knew whither the little ones thoughts were di rected but he did not wish to overthrow for the sake of a former false application the opportunely established seedtheory which she had most fortunately gathered from nature but the child spoke with an unwonted seriousness which demanded consideration Anna evidently disappointed and with a distressed tone But how did Freddy get into mama Who stuck him in and who stuck you into your mama Where did he come out from From this sudden storm of questions the father chose the last for his first answer Just think you know well enough that Freddy is a boy boys become men and girls women Only women and not men can have children now just think where could Freddy come out fromTHE ASSOCIATION METHOD 267 A Laughs joyfully and points to her genitals Did he come out here  Father Yes of course you certainly must have thought of this before A Overlooking the question But how did Freddy get into mama Did anybody plant him Was the seed planted  This very precise question could no longer be evaded by the father He explained to the child who listened with the great est attention that the mother is like the soil and the father like the gardener that the father provides the seed which grows in the mother and thus gives origin to a baby This answer gave extraordinary satisfaction she immediately ran to her mother and said Papa has told me everything now I know it all She did not however tell what she knew The new knowledge was however put into play the follow ing day Anna went to her mother and said Think mama papa told me how Freddy was a little angel and was brought from heaven by a stork The mother was naturally surprised and said No you are mistaken papa surely never told you such a thing whereupon the little one laughed and ran away This was apparently a mode of revenge Her mother did not wish or was not able to tell her how the eyes grew into the head hence she did not know how Freddy got into her It was for this reason that she again tempted her with the old story I wish to impress firmly upon parents and educators this instructive example of child psychology In the learned psy chological discussions on the childs psyche we hear nothing about those parts which are so important for the health and naturalness of our children nor do we hear more about the childs emotions and their conflicts and yet they play a most important r6le It very often happens that children are erroneously treated as quite imprudent and irrational beings Thus on indulgently re marking to an intelligent father whose 4yearold daughter masturbated excessively that care should be exercised in the presence of the child which slept in the same room with the parents I received the following indignant reply I can ab solutely assure you that the child knows nothing about sexual matters This would recall that distinguished old neurologist who wished to abjudicate the attribute sexual from a child birth phantasy which was represented in a dreamy state On the other hand a child evincing a neurotic talent exag gerated by neurosis may be urged on by solicitous parents How easy and tempting it would have been e g in the pres268 JUNG ent case to admire excite and develop prematurely the childs eager desire for learning and thereby develop an unnatural blas state and a precociousness masking a neurosis In such cases the parents must look after their own complexes and com plex tendencies and not make capital out of them at the expense of the child The idea should be dismissed once for all that children are held in bondage by or that they are the toys of their parents They are characteristic and new beings In the matter of enlightenment on things sexual it can be affirmed they suffer from the preconceived opinion that the truth is harmful Many neurologists are of the opinion that even in grownups enlightenment on their own psychosexual processes is harmful and even immoral Would not the same persons perhaps refuse to admit the existence of the genitals themselves  One should not however go from this extreme of prudish ness to the opposite one namely that of enlightenment d tout prix which may turn out as foolish as it is disagreeable In this respect I believe the use of some discretion to be decidedly the wiser plan still if children come upon any idea they should be deceived no more than adults I hope ladies and gentlemen that I have shown you what complicated psychic processes the psychanalytic investigation reveals in the child and how great is the significance of these processes for the mental wellbeing as well as for the general psychic development of the child What I have been unable to show you is the universal validity of these observations Unfortunately I am not in a position to show this for I do not know myself how much of it is universally valid Only the accumulation of such observations and a more farreaching penetration into the problem thus broached will give us a com plete insight into the laws of the psychic development It is to be regretted that we are at present still far from this goal But I confidently hope that educators and practical psycholo gists whether physicians or deepthinking parents will not leave us too long unassisted in this immensely important and interesting field

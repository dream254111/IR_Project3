the modern Northland boat which is in use along the coast of Norway round the North Cape to the frontier of Russia with the ancient Norsk boat In this boat he recognizes the oldest forms known These are known from the rock sculptures discov ered in Sweden and Norway which are supposed to have been made from five to eight hundred years before the Christian era from boatshaped stone burialgroups supposed to have been erected during the transition time from the bronze period to the iron age in Scandinavia and from boatremains The boat is lon narrow and low with stem and stern posts alike both being curved and high The rowlocks of these boats hear an oblique pro   7APRIL 8 1887 SCIE longation on one end and are furnished with a loop through which the oar is passed They have a single mast amidships and a single sail In the rock carvings similar boats are represented all along the coasts of the Baltic as far east as the southeast bank of Onega Lake and on the coast of Norway In the boatshaped stone groups the high stem and stern posts are indi cated by large bowlders the rowlocks by excava tions in the stones The boatrelics resemble the modern boat even in details and show how little change has been made in northern naval architec ture since olden times Donald A Cameron English consul for eastern Soudan is studying the ethnology of the district of Suakin The preliminary result of his re searches is that the Beja Bisharin which is the general name applied to all tribes of that country speaking Tobedawiet are the aborigines who gradually adopted Islam through contact with the coast or with Egypt after they had absorbed a number of Arabs from Yemen who had invaded their country Journ anthrop inst Feb 1887 The Bulletin of the Italian geographical society for February contains the catalogue of an ethno logical collection made by General Gene in the Italian possessions on the Red Sea It consists of implements clothing ornaments and weapons belonging to the Beja and some Somali and Abyssinian objects The explanation of the well known implements is very full and contains much valuable information Ph Paulitschke has published the results of his studies on the Somali Galla and Harrari  Bei trige zur Ethnographie und Anthropologie der Somafl Galla und Harari Leipzig 1886 He gives a full description of the ethnological char acter of these peoples and several anthropological measurements It is impossible to point out the numerous new observations contained in this book and we confine ourselves to stating the conclusions at which the author arrives regarding the history of these peoples Originally the country was in habited by negroes who had been driven from their old seats by Hamitic invaders who came from the north Later on an Arabic invasion took place which began in the sixth century and lasted until the sixteenth The invaders and Hamites intermarried and thus formed the Somali and Dankali which latter contain a larger propor tion of Semites These nations attacked the Gallas who were driven from the shore to the country they now occupy A map which accompanies the book shows the distribution of the tribes R N Cust has presented to the Anthropological institute of England a collection of symbolic letters such as are used by the Jebu in West NCE 335 Africa They are figured in the Journal of the anthropological institute February 1887 and full explanations are given There are many specimens of such messages in the ethnological collections but few of them have the explana tions which alone make them valuable It would be very desirable to have examples of symbolic messages collected among all peoples and their study pursued in connection with that of picturewriting and signlanguage The Journal of the anthropological institute February 1887 contains an interesting paper by A W Howitt on songs and songmakers of some Australian tribes and several specimens of songs noted down by G W Torrance The poets of the tribes are held in great esteem Their names are known to the neighboring peoples and their songs are carried from tribe to tribe even beyond the limits of the language in which they are com posed The natives believe that the songs are obtained by the bards from the spirits of the deceased usually their relatives during sleep in dreams but Howitt gives some instances of songs which are descriptive of events and as the poets declare composed under the influence of some natural cause Torrance gives three tunes which he has divided into bars according to the style of our music This however is not correct as the irregular accent does not allow their being arranged in this way Fortunately the study of aboriginal poetry and music is being taken up now by several students We call to mind Brin tons Stumpfs and Bakers researches But an energetic pursuit is very desirable as the native literature which is handed down by tradition alone is being rapidly lost everywhere Dr H Rink announces the death of Samuel Kleinschmidt which occurred at Godhaab Green land Feb 9 1886 Kleinschmidt who was born in Greenland is distinguished by his eminent knowledge of the Eskimo language The results of his studies which form the foundation of our knowledge of that language are contained in his dictionary and grammar of the Eskimo language Of late he took an active part in studying the meteorology of Greenland W Sievers gives a brief sketch of the Arhuaco Indians who live in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in the Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft fir Erd kunde vol xxi p 387 The author travelled in Columbia in 1886 and visited the four villages of these Indians The natives living on the northern declivity of the Sierra have preserved their old customs to a higher degree than the rest Sievers describes their round low huts and their scanty household goods which consist of a pot a bed a few wooden stools and a number of pouches336 SCIENCE made of the fibres of the agave The men and the women live in separate houses and are never allowed to be in one room The man takes his meals on a stone between his house and that of his wife They eat little meat but live princi pally on vegetables which are grown in small gardens Though many of them have become Christians they still adhere to their old religious feasts and dances which they perform at the celebration of the saints of their villages Each tribe has its peculiar dances which are accom panied by two kinds of flutes marimbas and rattles Sievers states that they believe a woman by the name of Inhimpitu to have been the mother of the ancestors of their gentes These ancestors created the earth the houses the sun which formerly was buried in the ground  the moon and the stars Takina is their princi pal place of worship Here rows of stones are found with interplaced granite bowlders A wizard watches this place which no Spaniard is allowed to visit In a small temple and two huts which stand near by various utensils used in the worship are kept  drums flutes masks rattles and tripods made of wood Under one of the large bowlders is the grave of a wizard to whom they give offerings The wizards cause disease by throwing spiders scorpions or lizards into the bodies of their enemies and cure the sick by ex tricating the cause of the disease They are not allowed to eat any salt During the great festi vals which are celebrated in January the Indians must abstain from the meat of domesticated ani mals At Masinga on the upper Manzanares there are large ruins of a temple and long re markably straight roads leading to it Ancient roads are found in many parts of the Sierra and are frequently used for the construction of modern roads A grammar of the language of the Arhuaco the K6ggaba has heen published by R Caledon  Gramatica de la lengua Koggaba Paris 1886 E T Hamy believes that the sinuous line which is found on one of the monuments of Copan in Honduras is identical with fhe Chinese TaYKi Journ anthrop inst February 1887 Though these figures closely resemble one another both consisting of two semicircles lying in opposite directions and touching each other this is no proof of a common origin and identical meaning The Chinese symbol represents two opposite prin ciples  the active and passive spirits the mascu line and feminine light and darkness The con clusion drawn from the similarity of ornaments occurring in widely separated regions upon the identity of their symbolic meaning or their com mon origin is fallacious VOL IX No 218 Chaffanjon who is exploring the upper Orinoco found at Ature in a cave of the Cerro de los muertos the burialplace of the Piaroas The corpses and those objects which had been most valuable to the deceased are put into a kind of basket or into a cylinder made of twigs arranged in parallel lines round the body and tied together Most of them are covered with stones to keep them from being disturbed In the cave of Arvina in Cerro Saloajito Chaffanjon found vases differing in style from those which Dr Creyaux found at Maipure On the rocks of Cerro Purtado he found large sculptures From his observations on these inscriptions he concludes that extraordinary means and a long time were required for making them These petroglyphs seem to be of frequent occurrence in those dis tricts Recently A Jahn found several in the Loma de Maya west of Caracas One of them is figured in the Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 1886 p 371 The commission for determining the bound ary between Brazil and Venezuela found others on the left bank of the Guainia between Solano and Buena Vista Similar rock inscriptions are found below Maroa near San Gabriel Itapini ma and at other places and according to W Sievers on the upper Manzanares Chaffanjon studied the dialects of the country he traversed and collected extensive vocabularies of the Bani ba Piaroa Guahiro Puinabe Piapoco and some of their grammatical elements All of these be long to the same stock

j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1010017,Notes,i242557,BOOK DEPARTMENT NOTES THE EDITOR OF EpochMaking Papers in United States History has collected a series of the most important American state papers from the Declaration of Independence to Lincolns Gettysburg address and accompanies these with an introduction and some thirty pages of notes His object is to prepare his collection for use in the public schools and so to render the pupils more familiar with those documents of American history that may truly be characterized as epochmaking The volume seems admirably adapted for use in the upper grades of school work THE MANUFACTURE AND PROPERTIES OF IRON AND STEEL is a supple ment to The Manufacture and Properties of Structural Steel by the same author published in I896 It aims to serve two purposes I To present in readable form the important technical facts of the iron and steel industry and 2 to discuss the question of international competition In Parts I and II of the volume the principal topics treated are the blast furnace the acid and basic Bessemer and openhearth processes of steel making the question of fuel the heat treatment of steel the methods of testing steel and the effect of various elements upon the physical properties of steel In Part III the posi tion of the leading factors in the worlds iron and steel trade is considered the industry in the United States being compared with that of the iron producing countries of Europe The book contains a large amount of statis tical matter and Part III gives an accurate description of the iron and steel industry of the world this being on the whole more satisfactory than anything hitherto published The book will be found of great service to the teacher of economics as well as to all those who are interested as investors or observers in the steel trade Its value to the engineer has been proven by the wide acceptance of the authors former work THE SIXTH

Annals of the American Academy been followed and the first part of the volume is devoted to two original studies covering one hundred and twentytwo pages The first of these is by the editor himself in collaboration with Mr M Mauss and treats of the primitive forms of classification that is of how human beings develop the idea of groupaction of organization implying the recognition of authority and the principle of cooperation in the attainment of definite ends The usual view of psychologists and logicians has been that this is an innate faculty of the understanding The view taken in this monograph is that these forms are determined through a sort of process of imitation from the form of society itself that is the way in which human beings group themselves and the manner of their divisions and subdivisions for the most elementary and general collective actions will be found running through every form of collective work and is determined by the same general considerations that determine such fundamental concepts as those of time and space The second monograph presents a general review of the most recent theories of the division of labor considered both as an economic and social principle It is by Mr C BouglI whose works on the social sciences in Germany and on ideas of equality are well known The second part covering 460 pages contains an analysis of all the important books monographs and scientific papers on sociological topics which appeared during the year This analysis is grouped under seven sec tions general sociology subdivided into method social philosophy ethno logical psychology history of civilization and history of sociology religious sociology juridical and moral sociology criminology economic sociology morphological sociology and finally a miscellaneous section with each of the foregoing sections containing many subdivisions THE STORY OF A GRAIN OF WHEAT is an account of an industrial process or rather of a series of processes made vivid by language and style that bring to description the relief of narrative and romance In this portrayal a human interest is engaged which is as universal as the desire for bread The history of wheat is made a historical presentation of human condition during the tardy development of enlightened production the black bread period the yellow bread period and the white bread period typify social environments which produced these forms of food It is a successful attempt to popularize exact knowledgethe results of solemn scientific research MR JOSEPH ELKINTON is to be commended for his work The Doukho bors5 It is seldom that a work intended as an appeal is reliable histori cally or of special interest to the general reader In both of these respects Mr Elkintons work is an exception

to habits formed under an old environment and to ignorance both of which may be overcome by a few rays of Western enlightenment rather than to any disposition that will stand permanently in the way of prosperity and good citizenship IN AN ESSAY ENTITLED Empire and Sovereignty Professor Freund dis cusses a variety of forms of state organization particularly those of the federal and imperial types from the point of view of sovereignty and reaches the conclusion that in scarcely any one of them is a perfect sovereignty coextensive with its political organization Beginning with that form which is commonly called the federal state he says the ingenuity of political writers has been taxed to fit the theory of the sovereignty of such a state to its peculiar struc ture His own opinion is that the federal state is not sovereign over its com ponent members because it never imposed its organization upon them by force or against their will and further because they cannot be destroyed by federal power As for the United States and Germany in particular he points out that certain matters are withdrawn from the power of constitutional amend ment We venture the opinion that Dr Freund has reached this conclusion which is not generally the accepted view from a failure to distinguish between state and government What he and others call a federal state is one having a dual system of government under a common sovereigntya sover eignty which stands back of the government is supreme over the government and legally unlimited If sovereignty is an essential attribute of every inde pendent state it is difficult to see how its form of government whether it be federal or consolidated can operate either to limit or enlarge its sovereignty The single limitation upon the sovereignty of the United States which he mentions with regard to the amendment of the Constitution is a selflimitation that is it is no limitation at all in law All other limitations are limitations upon the government and not upon the state Dr Freund reaches substantially the same conclusion with regard to states having autonomous colonies protectorates or other dependencies In all these dominions which include the whole of Australianearly the whole of America and a large part of Asia and Africa it is a very significant fact he says that there is no perfect sovereignty but only a qualified sovereignty A full realization of this fact if it be a fact must bring a revision of some of the fundamental doctrines of political science THE HISTORIAN OF THE MIDDLE AGES and the philosopher will find Pro fessor

is not as old as the Church It is true that the Church of the fourth century in which it took shape thought it found even in the apostolic age essentially similar institutions but the models which some persons have invoked and still invoke as precedents belong chiefly to legend Contrary to the tradition of centuries which has accustomed us to date the first secularization of the Church from the time when under Constantine she began to be a state Church Harnack maintains that in the middle of the third century she was already highly secularized She had already lowered her standard of life The strong bond that held her together was no longer a religious system or brotherly love but a hierarchic system which threatened to stifle not only Christian freedom and independence but also the very sense of brotherhood Especially under the influence of Neoplatonism Christianity became a philosophy rather than a religion But such a Church as this was no longer in a position to give peace to all that came to her and to shelter them from the world Then began the great upheaval and man fled not only from the world but from worldliness in the Church After discussing the rise of monasticism in pages which we have summar ized above the author considers the philosophy of monasticism its ideals and its evolution comparing the Eastern monasticism with that of the West and contrasting it with the tenets of modern Protestantism The second lecture that on St Augustine is shorter than the first but characterized by the same broad scholarship the same subtle psychological analysis and literary polish8 REV SAMUEL HEDGES book on Father Marquette9 is a laudatory but brief and rather unsatisfactory account of the great missionary and explorer It deals all too sparingly with the events of his busy life The object of the work is to prove that the town of St Ignace Michigan holds the remains of the picturesque apostle to the Indians The impression is gained that whatever Marquettes claims on posterity may be the writer never loses sight of the fact that he was a Jesuit JOHNS TRANSLATION OF THE CODE OF HAMMURABI King of Babylon B C 228522421 is an attempt to put into English a translation

the years 1669 and 1670 This is an interesting contemporary account of the character of the country which Lederer explored in three marches and of the customs and manners of the Indians of that region The original work of which there is a copy in the Harvard University Library is perhaps sufficiently rare to warrant this reprint which is neatly executed and accompanied by a reproduction of the map of the territory traversed HORACE GREELEY by William A Linn2 is the third of Appletons His toric Lives Series Himself an editor and for a time in personal contact with Mr Greeley Mr Linns writing carries a sympathy of expression that gives life to the sketch With Greeley we pass through many crucial experiences carrying with us the impressions and mental reactions the prejudices and the strong activities of a man whose influence was second to none and who pos sessed abilities equaled by few in a social and political contest which called away from private engagement and brought into public service the highest talents of nations The combined qualities of picturesqueness and great per sonal power of strong prejudice and high sense of honor of generosity and impetuosity make Greeley one of our most interesting public characters And Mr Linn has performed well the task of reproducing his leading charac teristics DR MEYER IN HIS RAILWAY LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES13 has added another

substantially evidenced by a recent publication of the Mississippi Historical Society4 a volume of nearly 6oo pages with some ten illustrations and maps Twentyseven different contributions are included in the contents all relating to some phase of the history of the state comprising papers of a military economic political biographical religious and archaeological char acter Several of these are of more than merely local interest especially six important articles on the political and constitutional history of the state notably those upon the Secession Convention the Reconstruction period and the Constitutional Convention of I890 The longest as well as one of the most inter esting and timely articles is that upon Suffrage and Reconstruction in Mis sissippi by Hon Frank Johnston The first report of the Department of Archives and History is also included in this volume A great deal of credit should be accorded to Professor Riley the secretary of the society and the chairman of the states Historical Commission for in large part it has been due to his enthusiasm and energy that this lively interest in the history of Mississippi has been aroused and has found expression in the establishment of a Department of Archives and History by the state5 WINTER INDIA by Miss Eliza R Scidmore is a charming book of travels Her descriptions have a vividness that enables the reader to see mental pictures quite as clearly as he sees the thirtyfour illustrations of the book and it matters not whether the subject of her pen picture be an inky black native of the Southern Capes or the snowwhite Himalayas Her account of the great empire in the East gives valuable side lights for the economist the sociologist and especially for the student of colonial questions who must know the ways of many types of men Those interested in the political aspects of Indian life should read the introductory chapter which gives a striking picture of the size and com plexity of India with its problems and its chaos 14Editedby Franklin L Riley Secretary Vol VI Pp 567 Oxford Miss 1902 15 Contributed by Herman V Ames 16p xvi 400 Price 2oo New York Century Company I90o 1T Contributed by J Russell Smith 346 102THE LETTERS OF DANIEL WEBSTER as compiled by Professor Van Tyne afford us a broad and interesting view of Websters personality Compara tively few are the instances where people of public note write personal letters with the intent that they shall ever become public Thus we find that a com plete collection of letters written on all varieties of occasions to people in high and low estate to people of importance and to those who are unknown beyond their own neighborhood to relatives friends and enemies would furnish better material for the estimate of character than most of the writings which were intended for the public eye Daniel Webster has a place in American history generally understood to be unique Biographies have appeared in numbers estimates of his character have again and again been written collections of his letters have been pub lished and his public acts should be known to every schoolboy Mr Van Tyne has at great pains supplemented the collection of letters before published and it seems unlikely that anything will be added in this line in the future The official correspondence of Webster can be obtained of course in the archives of the Department of State but the personal correspondence collected by Mr Van Tyne gives us an opportunity to see the man as he was to himself and to those who knew him best In a volume of nearly eight hundred pages have been collected and classi fied not alone letters written by Mr Webster but letters written to him which show perhaps as clearly as those sent by himself the general private trend of Mr Websters thought if indeed one may say there was a trend to his thought as revealed in these letters If one unacquainted with American history or the name of Webster were to read the book he might possibly not learn that Webster occupied a position so near to the summit of his ambition Indeed many of the letters written from Washington from the Senate or from the office of the Secretary of State are such as might have been written by any farmer manufacturer or village lawyer Perhaps there is as wide a difference between the public and private life of all men yet one is apt to look for a dif ferent form of expression or matter of discussion in the letters of those who are called great If the reading of letters is to give us all that can be found in them perhaps it is best that the work of the editor be not extended too far and that the letters be reproduced as nearly like those written as print can reproduce handwriting Abbreviations misspellings grammatical mistakes all those things in fact which may be found in a letter never intended for the public eye will show what could not be shown by the mere words if carefully edited We cannot be too thankful to Mr Van Tyne for his system of classifica tion of the letters The headings under which the letters are grouped are Early Life Local Politician The National Statesman Family Rela tions Relations with Friends and Neighbors The Farmer of Marshfield Intellectual Interests The Sportsman Personal Finances Religious and Moral Character Of course some who believe criticism to be fault finding might easily say that some of the letters belonged under headings 18By C H Van Tyne PhD Pp 769 Price 5co New York McClure Phillips  Co 1902 347 Notes I03The Annals of the American Academy where they are not found but it would take an unusual discernment and remarkable diligence to arrange the more than one thousand letters in a better manner than has been done by Mr Van Tyne The editor has suppressed him self except for a preface of ten pages and numerous footnotes which often throw light upon the ownership of the letters and upon references in the letters which would be otherwise obscure A few documents which are not letters are included and are not out of place Notes for some of Mr Websters most famous speeches are reproduced A few extracts from speeches made in the Senate have an added interest from the fact that they are taken from his own handwriting rather than from the official reports To comment upon many of the most interesting letters would fill too much space But among the hundreds which deserve comment especially interesting is one in February 1829 in which Webster gives a synopsis of his estimate of General Jackson No doubt all readers except those especially studying poli tics will be more interested in the letters classified under Family Rlations and other headings which include the private character of Mr Webster His letters to his children show clearly that he was not so thoroughly absorbed in his public career and his ambition to be President as to forget to discuss with interest the daily school work of his sons or to fulfill his promise of a new hat for his daughter While it may be noted that the tone of his letters to his first wife differ from that used toward his second wife it must be admitted that such difference could be amply explained by the different natures of the two women The special student and the cultivated reader of American history have great cause to be grateful to Mr Van Tyne for his volume of The Letters of Daniel Websterl9 THE POSSIBLE ECONOMIC FUTURE OF AFRICA assumes a rosier hue with the return of every explorer Twixt Sirdar and Menelik2 by Captain M S Wellby is the record of a journey from East Africa opposite Aden across Abyssinia to Lake Rudolph and down the Nile valley to Khartoum The traveler a British officer thinking of strategy of hunting and of polo gives us nevertheless side glimpses of a fine plateau country in Abyssinia The climate is good and bracing barley and native grains are cultivated the native pony is a hardy animal the native mule is excellent hogs cattle and sheep are kept game abounds and immense stretches of fertile land are covered with sixfoot grass and lying idle All these livestock possibilities are as near to Europe as are the plains of Wyoming and can easily be made as available or even more so The people of Abyssinia are much praised and after giving many instances of their amazing generosity the author declares I maintain that in Abyssinia there are just as good men to be found as there are in any other country 19 Contributed by George Emory Fellows Orono Maine 20 p xxv 408 New York Harper  Brothers 348 I04As might be expected the lowlying plains around Lake Rudolph and in the valleys tributary to the Nile were found to be far less promising2 REPUBLICS VERSUS WOMEN 2 is of interest from two standpoints I Because of its form and 2 because it so aptly represents the feelings of a proud American woman when she is forced to contemplate the mortifications of a womans social and political position in America The book is dramatic in effect for it purports to be a speech made by the writer to a secret society of foreign women of high birth who wished to elevate humanity by over throwing aristocracies In order to save them and especially a valued friend from this design the writer explained in full the political civil and legal status of women in the United States thereby making it plain to her hearers that since the first of all republics neglects women anarchy and socialism which must of necessity resemble a republic can only lead to a man govern ment in which women are not recognized The discourse is lucid forceful and able The relation of personal experiences undergone by a wellborn American woman in endeavoring to secure recognition adds to the interest Curious facts are used as illustrations In view of the accusations regarding womens luxury it is interesting to know that while New York women spend forty millions in dress the men spend one hundred and sixty million on alcohol and tobacco and sixty million on clubs and sports not to mention the millions that go to less reputable pleasures SPAIN AND HER PEOPLE23 by Jeremiah Zimmerman LL D contains in addition to considerable information needed by the prospective tourist an interesting study of the Spanish people since the war with the United States Unfortunately the book is without index or chapter analysis and the brief titles of chapters are often far from descriptive of the miscellaneous contents Much history is quoted from secondary sources and the work appears to be that of a clergyman prone to moralizing and the telling of all that he knows From many scattered passages one may piece together the following analysis of the Spaniard and his situation Backward and povertystricken Spain is a product of centuries of misgov ernment which still continues and the priestridden people lave no faith in the government an opinion in which the late Dr J L M Curry concurred The omnipresent beggar shows evident signs of hunger and it is estimated that onehalf of the population is underfed and this in a country where hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile soil lie idle and rich minerals are waiting to be mined Much of the country is deforested waste but the pro ductions of the soil might be increased 200 per cent if put on a par with France The laborer is often idle and the leading citizens have no capital and plan 21 Contributed by J Russell Smith 22 By Mrs

London and New York The Macmillan Company I9o3 These biographical studies by Mr Bryce are in the truest sense what the title indicates They are not biographies as biographies are usually consid ered but rather so many clear and apprerciative essays on the character and personality of a score of famous Englishmen of the last fifty years A number of them have appeared in periodicals but these have not been revised and enlarged for the present volume The studies begin with Disraeli and conclude with Gladstone But these two cannot be taken as typical Among the other names there are only a few of universal reputation They are for the most part men of eminence in special fields of human activity and although well known to the specialist their names are not familiar to the general reader Such

COLLABORATION WITH MR M MAUSS AND TREATS OF THE PRIMITIVE FORMS OF CLASSIFICATION THAT IS OF HOW HUMAN BEINGS DEVELOP THE IDEA OF GROUPACTION OF ORGANIZATION IMPLYING THE RECOGNITION OF AUTHORITY AND THE PRINCIPLE OF COOPERATION IN THE ATTAINMENT OF DEFINITE ENDS THE USUAL VIEW OF PSYCHOLOGISTS AND LOGICIANS HAS BEEN THAT THIS IS AN INNATE FACULTY OF THE UNDERSTANDING THE VIEW TAKEN IN THIS MONOGRAPH IS THAT THESE FORMS ARE DETERMINED THROUGH A SORT OF PROCESS OF IMITATION FROM THE FORM OF SOCIETY ITSELF THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH HUMAN BEINGS GROUP THEMSELVES AND THE MANNER OF THEIR DIVISIONS AND SUBDIVISIONS FOR THE MOST ELEMENTARY AND GENERAL COLLECTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE FOUND RUNNING THROUGH EVERY FORM OF COLLECTIVE WORK AND IS DETERMINED BY THE SAME GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT DETERMINE SUCH FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS AS THOSE OF TIME AND SPACE THE SECOND MONOGRAPH PRESENTS A GENERAL REVIEW OF THE MOST RECENT THEORIES OF THE DIVISION OF LABOR CONSIDERED BOTH AS AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PRINCIPLE IT IS BY MR C BOUGLI WHOSE WORKS ON THE SOCIAL SCIENCES IN GERMANY AND ON IDEAS OF EQUALITY ARE WELL KNOWN THE SECOND PART COVERING 460 PAGES CONTAINS AN ANALYSIS OF ALL THE IMPORTANT BOOKS MONOGRAPHS AND SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ON SOCIOLOGICAL TOPICS WHICH APPEARED DURING THE YEAR THIS ANALYSIS IS GROUPED UNDER SEVEN SEC TIONS GENERAL SOCIOLOGY SUBDIVIDED INTO METHOD SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY

MISCELLANEOUS SECTION WITH EACH OF THE FOREGOING SECTIONS CONTAINING MANY SUBDIVISIONS THE STORY OF A GRAIN OF WHEAT IS AN ACCOUNT OF AN INDUSTRIAL PROCESS OR RATHER OF A SERIES OF PROCESSES MADE VIVID BY LANGUAGE AND STYLE THAT BRING TO DESCRIPTION THE RELIEF OF NARRATIVE AND ROMANCE IN THIS PORTRAYAL A HUMAN INTEREST IS ENGAGED WHICH IS AS UNIVERSAL AS THE DESIRE FOR BREAD THE HISTORY OF WHEAT IS MADE A HISTORICAL PRESENTATION OF HUMAN CONDITION DURING THE TARDY DEVELOPMENT OF ENLIGHTENED PRODUCTION THE BLACK BREAD PERIOD THE YELLOW BREAD PERIOD AND THE WHITE BREAD PERIOD TYPIFY

TO HABITS FORMED UNDER AN OLD ENVIRONMENT AND TO IGNORANCE BOTH OF WHICH MAY BE OVERCOME BY A FEW RAYS OF WESTERN ENLIGHTENMENT RATHER THAN TO ANY DISPOSITION THAT WILL STAND PERMANENTLY IN THE WAY OF PROSPERITY AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP IN AN ESSAY ENTITLED EMPIRE AND SOVEREIGNTY PROFESSOR FREUND DIS CUSSES A VARIETY OF FORMS OF STATE ORGANIZATION PARTICULARLY THOSE OF THE FEDERAL AND IMPERIAL TYPES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SOVEREIGNTY AND REACHES THE CONCLUSION THAT IN SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM IS A PERFECT SOVEREIGNTY COEXTENSIVE WITH ITS POLITICAL ORGANIZATION BEGINNING WITH THAT FORM WHICH IS COMMONLY CALLED THE FEDERAL STATE HE SAYS THE INGENUITY OF POLITICAL WRITERS HAS BEEN TAXED TO FIT THE THEORY OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF SUCH A STATE TO ITS PECULIAR STRUC TURE HIS OWN OPINION IS THAT THE FEDERAL STATE IS NOT SOVEREIGN OVER ITS COM PONENT MEMBERS BECAUSE IT NEVER IMPOSED ITS ORGANIZATION UPON THEM BY FORCE OR AGAINST THEIR WILL AND FURTHER BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY FEDERAL POWER AS FOR THE UNITED STATES AND GERMANY IN PARTICULAR HE POINTS OUT THAT CERTAIN MATTERS ARE WITHDRAWN FROM THE POWER OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMEND MENT WE VENTURE THE OPINION THAT DR FREUND HAS REACHED THIS CONCLUSION WHICH IS NOT GENERALLY THE ACCEPTED VIEW FROM A FAILURE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN STATE AND GOVERNMENT WHAT HE AND OTHERS CALL A FEDERAL STATE IS ONE HAVING A DUAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT UNDER A COMMON SOVEREIGNTYA SOVER EIGNTY WHICH STANDS BACK OF THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPREME OVER THE GOVERNMENT AND LEGALLY UNLIMITED IF SOVEREIGNTY IS AN ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTE OF EVERY INDE PENDENT STATE IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW ITS FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT BE FEDERAL OR CONSOLIDATED CAN OPERATE EITHER TO LIMIT OR ENLARGE ITS SOVEREIGNTY THE SINGLE LIMITATION UPON THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH HE MENTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION IS A SELFLIMITATION THAT IS IT IS NO LIMITATION AT ALL IN LAW ALL OTHER LIMITATIONS ARE LIMITATIONS UPON THE GOVERNMENT AND NOT UPON THE STATE DR FREUND REACHES SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME CONCLUSION WITH REGARD TO STATES HAVING AUTONOMOUS COLONIES PROTECTORATES OR OTHER DEPENDENCIES IN ALL THESE DOMINIONS WHICH INCLUDE THE WHOLE OF AUSTRALIANEARLY THE WHOLE OF AMERICA AND A LARGE PART OF ASIA AND AFRICA IT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT FACT HE SAYS THAT THERE IS NO PERFECT SOVEREIGNTY BUT ONLY A QUALIFIED SOVEREIGNTY A FULL REALIZATION OF THIS FACT IF IT BE A FACT MUST BRING A REVISION OF SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES OF POLITICAL SCIENCE THE HISTORIAN OF THE MIDDLE AGES AND THE PHILOSOPHER WILL FIND PRO FESSOR

IS NOT AS OLD AS THE CHURCH IT IS TRUE THAT THE CHURCH OF THE FOURTH CENTURY IN WHICH IT TOOK SHAPE THOUGHT IT FOUND EVEN IN THE APOSTOLIC AGE ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS BUT THE MODELS WHICH SOME PERSONS HAVE INVOKED AND STILL INVOKE AS PRECEDENTS BELONG CHIEFLY TO LEGEND CONTRARY TO THE TRADITION OF CENTURIES WHICH HAS ACCUSTOMED US TO DATE THE FIRST SECULARIZATION OF THE CHURCH FROM THE TIME WHEN UNDER CONSTANTINE SHE BEGAN TO BE A STATE CHURCH HARNACK MAINTAINS THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THIRD CENTURY SHE WAS ALREADY HIGHLY SECULARIZED SHE HAD ALREADY LOWERED HER STANDARD OF LIFE THE STRONG BOND THAT HELD HER TOGETHER WAS NO LONGER A RELIGIOUS SYSTEM OR BROTHERLY LOVE BUT A HIERARCHIC SYSTEM WHICH THREATENED TO STIFLE NOT ONLY CHRISTIAN FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE BUT ALSO THE VERY SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD ESPECIALLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NEOPLATONISM CHRISTIANITY BECAME A PHILOSOPHY RATHER THAN A RELIGION BUT SUCH A CHURCH AS THIS WAS NO LONGER IN A POSITION TO GIVE PEACE TO ALL THAT CAME TO HER AND TO SHELTER THEM FROM THE WORLD THEN BEGAN THE GREAT UPHEAVAL AND MAN FLED NOT ONLY FROM THE WORLD BUT FROM WORLDLINESS IN THE CHURCH AFTER DISCUSSING THE RISE OF MONASTICISM IN

FIRST REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ARCHIVES AND HISTORY IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS VOLUME A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT SHOULD BE ACCORDED TO PROFESSOR RILEY THE SECRETARY OF THE SOCIETY AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

346 102THE LETTERS OF DANIEL WEBSTER AS COMPILED BY PROFESSOR VAN TYNE AFFORD US A BROAD AND INTERESTING VIEW OF WEBSTERS PERSONALITY COMPARA TIVELY FEW ARE THE INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE OF PUBLIC NOTE WRITE PERSONAL LETTERS WITH THE INTENT THAT THEY SHALL EVER BECOME PUBLIC THUS WE FIND THAT A COM PLETE COLLECTION OF LETTERS WRITTEN ON ALL VARIETIES OF OCCASIONS TO PEOPLE IN HIGH AND LOW ESTATE TO PEOPLE OF IMPORTANCE AND TO THOSE WHO ARE UNKNOWN BEYOND THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD TO RELATIVES FRIENDS AND ENEMIES WOULD FURNISH BETTER MATERIAL FOR THE ESTIMATE OF CHARACTER THAN MOST OF THE WRITINGS WHICH WERE INTENDED FOR THE PUBLIC EYE DANIEL WEBSTER HAS A PLACE IN AMERICAN HISTORY GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE UNIQUE BIOGRAPHIES HAVE APPEARED IN NUMBERS ESTIMATES OF HIS CHARACTER HAVE AGAIN AND AGAIN BEEN WRITTEN COLLECTIONS OF HIS LETTERS HAVE BEEN PUB LISHED AND HIS PUBLIC ACTS SHOULD BE KNOWN TO EVERY SCHOOLBOY MR VAN TYNE HAS AT GREAT PAINS SUPPLEMENTED THE COLLECTION OF LETTERS BEFORE PUBLISHED AND IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT ANYTHING WILL BE ADDED IN THIS LINE IN THE FUTURE THE OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF WEBSTER CAN BE OBTAINED OF COURSE IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE BUT THE PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE COLLECTED BY MR VAN TYNE GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE MAN AS HE WAS TO HIMSELF AND TO THOSE WHO KNEW HIM BEST IN A VOLUME OF NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED PAGES HAVE BEEN COLLECTED AND CLASSI FIED NOT ALONE LETTERS WRITTEN BY MR WEBSTER BUT LETTERS WRITTEN TO HIM WHICH SHOW PERHAPS AS CLEARLY AS THOSE SENT BY HIMSELF THE GENERAL PRIVATE TREND OF MR WEBSTERS THOUGHT IF INDEED ONE MAY SAY THERE WAS A TREND TO HIS THOUGHT AS REVEALED IN THESE LETTERS IF ONE UNACQUAINTED WITH AMERICAN HISTORY OR THE NAME OF WEBSTER WERE TO READ THE BOOK HE MIGHT POSSIBLY NOT LEARN THAT WEBSTER OCCUPIED A POSITION SO NEAR TO THE SUMMIT OF HIS AMBITION INDEED MANY OF THE LETTERS WRITTEN FROM WASHINGTON FROM THE SENATE OR FROM THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE ARE SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY ANY FARMER MANUFACTURER OR VILLAGE LAWYER PERHAPS THERE IS AS WIDE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE OF ALL MEN YET ONE IS APT TO LOOK FOR A DIF FERENT FORM OF EXPRESSION OR MATTER OF DISCUSSION IN THE LETTERS OF THOSE WHO ARE CALLED GREAT IF THE READING OF LETTERS IS TO GIVE US ALL THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THEM PERHAPS IT IS BEST THAT THE WORK OF THE EDITOR BE NOT EXTENDED TOO FAR AND THAT THE LETTERS BE REPRODUCED AS NEARLY LIKE THOSE WRITTEN AS PRINT CAN REPRODUCE HANDWRITING ABBREVIATIONS MISSPELLINGS GRAMMATICAL MISTAKES ALL THOSE THINGS IN FACT WHICH MAY BE FOUND IN A LETTER NEVER INTENDED FOR THE PUBLIC EYE WILL SHOW WHAT COULD NOT BE SHOWN BY THE MERE WORDS IF CAREFULLY EDITED WE CANNOT BE TOO THANKFUL TO MR VAN TYNE FOR HIS SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICA TION OF THE LETTERS THE HEADINGS UNDER WHICH THE LETTERS ARE GROUPED ARE EARLY LIFE LOCAL POLITICIAN THE NATIONAL STATESMAN FAMILY RELA TIONS RELATIONS WITH FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS THE FARMER OF MARSHFIELD INTELLECTUAL INTERESTS THE SPORTSMAN PERSONAL FINANCES RELIGIOUS AND MORAL CHARACTER OF COURSE SOME WHO BELIEVE CRITICISM TO BE FAULT FINDING MIGHT EASILY SAY THAT SOME OF THE LETTERS

DISCERNMENT AND REMARKABLE DILIGENCE TO ARRANGE THE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND LETTERS IN A BETTER MANNER THAN HAS BEEN DONE BY MR VAN TYNE THE EDITOR HAS SUPPRESSED HIM SELF EXCEPT FOR A PREFACE OF TEN PAGES AND NUMEROUS FOOTNOTES WHICH OFTEN THROW LIGHT UPON THE OWNERSHIP OF THE LETTERS AND UPON REFERENCES IN THE LETTERS WHICH WOULD BE OTHERWISE OBSCURE A FEW DOCUMENTS WHICH ARE NOT LETTERS ARE INCLUDED AND ARE NOT OUT OF PLACE NOTES FOR SOME OF MR WEBSTERS MOST FAMOUS SPEECHES ARE REPRODUCED A FEW EXTRACTS FROM SPEECHES MADE IN THE SENATE HAVE AN ADDED INTEREST FROM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE TAKEN FROM HIS OWN HANDWRITING RATHER THAN FROM THE OFFICIAL REPORTS TO COMMENT UPON MANY OF THE MOST INTERESTING LETTERS WOULD FILL TOO MUCH SPACE BUT AMONG THE HUNDREDS WHICH DESERVE COMMENT ESPECIALLY INTERESTING IS ONE IN FEBRUARY 1829 IN WHICH WEBSTER GIVES A SYNOPSIS OF HIS ESTIMATE OF GENERAL JACKSON NO DOUBT ALL READERS EXCEPT THOSE ESPECIALLY STUDYING POLI TICS WILL BE MORE INTERESTED IN THE LETTERS CLASSIFIED UNDER FAMILY RLATIONS AND OTHER HEADINGS WHICH INCLUDE THE PRIVATE CHARACTER OF MR WEBSTER HIS LETTERS TO HIS CHILDREN SHOW CLEARLY THAT HE WAS NOT SO THOROUGHLY ABSORBED IN HIS PUBLIC CAREER AND HIS AMBITION TO BE PRESIDENT AS TO FORGET TO DISCUSS WITH INTEREST THE DAILY SCHOOL WORK OF HIS SONS OR TO FULFILL HIS PROMISE OF A NEW HAT FOR HIS DAUGHTER WHILE IT MAY BE NOTED THAT THE TONE OF HIS LETTERS TO HIS FIRST WIFE DIFFER FROM THAT USED TOWARD HIS SECOND WIFE IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SUCH DIFFERENCE COULD BE AMPLY EXPLAINED BY THE DIFFERENT NATURES OF

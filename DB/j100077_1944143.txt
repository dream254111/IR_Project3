j100077,The American Political Science Review,1944143,Direct Legislation in 1916,i306597,Direct Legislation in 19161 Aside from electing a President of the United States United States senators in 32 States representatives to congress in every State and many state and local officers 38 States in the Union at the last election passed upon proposed changes in their constitutions or upon measures submitted under the initiative and referendum In these 38 States there was a total of 173 measures voted upon of which 96 or approximately 55 per cent were adopted These 173 proposals included 86 constitutional amendments proposed by legislatures 31 initiated constitutional amendments 24 laws re ferred by legislatures 14 laws referred by petition 15 initiated bills and 3 questions of sentiment voted upon in a number of representative districts in Massachusetts the result to serve to instruct representa tives from those districts in the general court Louisiana with 18 amendments led with the greatest number of proposed constitutional changes California which in 1914 had 48 measures on the ballot has this year only 7 Thirteen measures submitted in Alabama Geor gia Louisiana and South Carolina were purely local in character yet it was necessary that they be voted on by the electorate of the entire State In Oklahoma and Minnesota 8 constitutional amendments and measures were defeated for lack of a constitutional majority of all the votes cast at the election and considerable doubt prevails about the validity of a ninth in Illinois although every one of the measures re ceived an overwhelming majority of the votes that were cast on it The amendments and measures as usual covered the whole catalogue of public issues Taxation and finance Of all issues taxation and finance was the subject of the greatest number of proposed changes and there were submitted 27 measures bearing directly upon this subject Amend ments providing for the classification of property for purposes of taxa tion were voted on in four States namely Illinois South Dakota Utah and Montana In Illinois the amendment received a majority of 360516 of the votes cast upon it yet there is a controversy as to whether under the constitution a majority of all votes cast at the election was For referendum in constitutional conventions see p 110LEGISLATIVE NOTES AND REVIEWS 93 given the state canvassing board holding that only a majority of the votes cast for members of the legislature is required has ruled that the tax amendment was adopted If however the amendment must receive a majority of all the votes cast at the election for governor it has failed by approximately 15000 votes A test of the validity of the amendment in the supreme court is now awaited Since 1818 when the State was admitted to the Union there has been no fundamental change in the taxing system of Illinois although twice an overwhelm ing majority vote has been cast in favor of a proposal to give the legis lature power to devise a new taxing system A constitutional amend ment in South Dakota providing for the classification of property for assessment at different rates and for the taxing of incomes and fran chises failed as did also a tax amendment in Utah providing for classi fication and a whole new revenue scheme for the State In Montana a constitutional amendment providing for the creation of a county board of equalization and a state board of equalization and permitting the latter to require the same rate of assessment on the same classes of property in different counties was adopted An initiated measure proposing to abolish the Colorado tax commission and to transfer its powers and duties to the state board of equalization failed to carry In Louisiana a constitutional amendment creating a board of state affairs of three members was adopted The amendment makes it the duty of the board to assess all taxable property throughout the State uniformly and gives it such powers as may be conferred by the legislature in re spect to assessment budget income and expenditures The budget system for state revenues and expenditures was adopted in Maryland The amendment as passed requires that the governor shall present to the legislature a budget giving a complete plan of pro posed expenditures and estimated revenues for the two succeeding years showing clearly any surplus or deficit in state funds The governor may except where the amount is fixed by law as in the case of public schools revise the estimates presented to him either by state officers or stateaided institutions The legislature may not increase the es timates presented by the governor or pass any additional appropriation act except by a majority vote but may reduce items except the provi sion for the state debt and for the judiciary In Washington a meas ure providing for the budget system for the raising and expenditure of revenues by counties cities towns townships port districts school districts and metropolitan park districts which was passed by the See pp 11311494 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW legislature and ordered referred by petition was overwhelmingly de feated Two States considered the single item veto power of the gov ernor In Oregon such an amendment was adopted while in Minne sota the proposal to extend the governors power of veto to any part of any item in appropriation bills failed The single tax which has been twice rejected by the voters of Cali fornia in the past four years appeared again on the ballot and was again rejected It is interesting to note however that 260332 Cali fornians favored this system of taxation In Oregon a measure pro viding for a full rental land tax and at the same time a home makers loan fund was defeated The electors in Oregon voted to adopt a measure providing for the limitation of the taxing powers in the State and limiting the power of counties to incur indebtedness An amend rnent was rejected in Alabama which would allow certain cities and towns to vote on increasing city taxes for general purposes not exceed ing 1 per cent of the value of property in the towns Another amend inent carried in Alabama providing for reapportionment of taxes in the city of Selma Six States considered the question of tax exemptions The voters in Arizona did not approve of a long list of proposed exemptions including federal state county and municipal property public debts of all politi cal subdivisions property of widows up to 2000 and property of edu cational charitable and religious organizations An amendment failed to carry in Montana which also would have exempted federal state religious and charitable property from taxation and which in addition would have authorized the legislature to exempt from taxation evi dences of debt secured by mortgages upon real or personal property Hereafter in Florida property to the value of 500 of every widow who has a family dependent upon her for support and of every resident of the State who has lost a limb or has been disabled in war or by misfortune wilI be exempted from taxation Louisiana voted to exempt all ships engaged in oversea trade if domiciled in a Louisiana port It was voted in Oregon that all vessels of 50 tons or over should be exempt from taxation Georgia however will continue to collect a tax on ships owned in the State and trading overseas In two States amendments were adopted on the subject of indebted ness of cities In Louisiana two such amendments provided for the funding of certain debts of the cities of Shreveport and New Orleans and also of the school board of the latter the purpose being to take up the floating debt and put the finances of these cities on a cash basisLEGISLATIVE NOTES AND REVIEWS 95 An amendment approved in South Carolina allows the city of Anderson to increase its bonded indebtedness to an amount not exceeding 15 per cent of the value of its taxable property Authorization was given Louisiana municipalities parishes and wards to levy special taxes for the maintenance of fairs Another amendment in Louisiana which won at the polls gives the legislature authority to enact general laws authorizing parishes wards and municipalities to levy special taxes in aid of public improvements transportation lines and navigation canals with the consent of the property tax payers The Louisiana state peni tentiary was permitted by vote of the people to fund its indebtedness not exceeding 400000 at not more than 5 per cent Bond issues carrying millions of dollars for various purposes were submitted to the voters for their approval or rejection in 7 States There was a total of 10 such measures and all except the one in Mon tana for the purpose of starting a twine factory were approved As a result California will issue and sell state bonds in the sum of 15000000 for the construction of the uncompleted portion of the system of state highways prescribed by the state highway act of 1909 New York State will issue bonds in the sum of 10000000 for the acquisition of lands for state park purposes and New Jersey will construct and improve the highways of the State to the extent of the approved bond issue of 7000000 Three bond issues were carried in Rhode Island850000 for institutions 300000 for bridges and 130000 for an armory The Charleston South Carolina school district was authorized to vote bonds to an amount not exceeding 250000 for new school buildings and Ker shaw County in the same State may increase its bonded indebtedness for the erection of school buildings by submitting the question to the electors of the district The amount of bonded indebtedness of the State of Nevada was raised from 300000 to 1 per cent of the assessed valuation of the State in order to obtain money from the federal gov ernment for good roads Prohibition and the regulation of the liquor traffic was an issue in many States at the last election and was voted for both ways Michi gan Montana Nebraska South Dakota Idaho Missouri Arizona and California voted on statewide prohibition and as a result the first 4 States were added to the dry territory making a total of 23 dry States Idaho adopted a prohibition constitutional amendment after ten months experience under statutory prohibition and Arizona approved a simi lar amendment having been dry by statute since 1914 In addition to96 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW these States Alaska was voted dry and Florida and Utah elected legis latures and governors pledged to immediate statutory prohibition Missouri outside of St Louis gave a majority of 15000 for prohibi tion Of the 2543 counties in the United States 2188 were dry either by statute or local option following the last November election It is claimed now that only 40 per cent of the total population of the United States lives in wet territory and this wet territory is now reduced to 15 per cent of the total area of the United States Arkansas overwhelmingly turned down the proposal to substitute local option for prohibition and local option was also defeated in Ari zona and Michigan California had a second amendment on the liquor question providing for partial prohibition in 1918 but this too was turned down South Dakota besides adopting statewide prohibition voted down a liquor measure which would have provided for the issu ance of permits for the sale of intoxicating liquors and for the signing and filing of petitions for election on the subject of the sale of liquor Vermont voted on the question as to the time when the statewide pro hibition law should go into effect and decided it for the year 1927 Ore gon by a decided majority refused to permit the manufacture and regulated sale ofA4 per cent malt liquors and furthermore voted to pro hibit entirely the importation of intoxicating liquors for beverage pur poses The State of Washington by a vote of nearly 6 to 1 refused to sanction officially the hotel mens initiative bill which

manufacture and sale of beer in unbroken packages direct to the consumer The electors vetoed a second initiative measure in Washington known as the brewery bill which attempted to weaken the prohibition laws of the State by remov ing restrictions on home consumption authorizing the brewing of malt liquors regulating the sale by manufacturers and hotels and providing for brewery hotel and

Minnesota again polled a big majority on the amendment pro viding for the enactment of legislation including constitutional amend ments by means of the initiative and referendum but the measure failed for lack of a constitutional majority In Arizona the attempt failed which would require initiative measures to receive a majority of the total vote of electors voting at an election Washington electors strongly voted no on two proposals limiting the initiative referendum and recall by requiring that petitions be signed before registration offi cers and otherwise amending the present laws In Massachusetts a vote of sentiment as to the adoption of the initiative and referendum was taken in 37 representative districts of the commonwealth the re sult to instruct representatives from those

under which they would enforce any rights An amendment to the California direct primary law of98 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW 1913 governing nominations at primary elections failed to pass The amendment would have permitted the elector to declare his party affilia tion at the polls instead of when registering and provided that any such elector must cast his vote for candidates of that party only and for present nonpartisan offices In case the elector did not declare his party affiliation he could vote for nonpartisan offices only and the election officers before delivering the

party was adopted in Massachusetts Ver mont voted for giving immediate effect to a direct primary law An initiative measure that failed in Oklahoma although it received a majority of the votes cast

things aimed to prevent the legislature from passing any law concern ing registration of electors by providing the initiative as the only method to enact such a law An amendment based on the grandfather clause failed in Florida which had it passed offered the probability of liti gation extending to the United States supreme court The require ment that only tax payers be allowed to vote on

for a fivesixths jury100 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW verdict in civil cases Although both amendments received a majority of the vote on the question Minnesota can neither increase the size of the supreme court from five to seven members nor extend the terms of probate judges from two to four years because neither measure re ceived a constitutional majority of the total vote at the election The governor of North Carolina in order to prevent delays in trials was authorized to appoint emergency judges to hold courts when no regu lar judge is available The provisions of the organic

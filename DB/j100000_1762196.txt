destroy the red scale Furthermore they questioned whether the chalcid would destroy the true red scale as they did not believe that the scale on the or chards mentioned was identical with that about Orange The Vedalia has brought the people a simple rapid and effective remedy for the white scale and the commission was very solicitous lest the people should give up the use of washes for the reel scale and wait for the spread of the chalcid parasite If the parasite should multiply but slowly which seems probable the red scale would be enabled to spread and clo great harm before os ertaken It is of the highest importance at this time that a constant fight against this scale should be made and there should be no halting even if imperfect means of holding the pest in check are only at hand Professor Henry carefully examined the experiments conducted by Mr Coquillett with resin washes and considers that he has used excellent judgment in the manner in which he has conducted them and thinks he plans his spraying experiments carefully and with good judgment and carries them through with thoroughness to the end It seems of the highest importance that experimentswith washes be prosecuted and that the great advance of the last year be fol lowed Up vigorously With the resin washes for the red scale and the TEedalzcr for the white scale the citrus industry will again  move forward and people have the confidence in it of former days CAUSATION OF HOGCHOLERA  INVESTIGATIONS of the epizootic diseases of swine occurring in the neighborhood of Baltimore have been made by Professor Wil liam H Welch MD with the cooperation of A W Clement VS and F L Russell VS in the Pathological Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University during the past two years They examined about fifty hogs from six herds affected with hog cholera as well as several isolated cases Only a summary of the most important lesults will be given here a fuller report being in preparation for the volume of studies from the Pathological Lab oratory to be issued by the Johns Hopkins Hospital The mvst common and characteristic lesions as given in the lohns Ilopkzns Bsletzn for December consisted in superficial and deep necroses either circumscribed or diffuse of the inflamed mucous and other coats of the large intestine associated often with superficial branny diphtheritic exudation Similar necroses were occasionally found in the stomach and small intestine in the mouth palate and epiglottis and less frequently in the gallbladder bile ducts and preputial sac Some form of pneumonia was usually although not constantly present In a few cases pneumonia was present without intestinal lesions rnore frequently intestinal le sions were observed with little or no pneumonia Strongyles in the bronchi were rarely missed Bronchitis was the rule Pleurisy was common pericarditis and peritonitis were present in the minority of cases Redness of the skin was common but incon stant The subcutaneous mediastinal and abdominal Iymph glands were usually swollen and reddened chiefly in the periphery The spleen was often normal but in many cases xvas moderately and sometilnes extremely swollen The kidneys were either normal or the seat of hemorrhages and of parenchymatous degeneration or nephritis The liver was often normal but sometimes it pre sented necrotic areas Ecchymoses were often observed in the gastric and intestinal mucosa and beneath the epi and endo car eIium In sofze cases all of the organs of the body were studded with small hemorrhages The bacteriological examination consisted in the study of cover glass preparations from the diSerent parts of the body in the in oculation of animals either white mice or rabbits with parts of the lung spleen liver intestine and sometimes other organs and in the preparation of Esmarch roll cultures usually of agar from the blood intestinal contents and all of the principal organs of the body Of the bacteria isolated in pure culture and observed in micro scopical preparations of the tissues only two species were sufR ctently common or had such distibution as to suggest an etiological relation to the disease These are the socalled hogcholera bacil lus and the swineplague bacillus the former first described in the 4 Report of the Bureau of Animal Industry for I885  as the bac terium of swineplague and in the report for I886 as the bacterium of hogFcholeraa change of nomenclature due to the detection in certain diseased swine in this country of the latter organism which now received the name of the 4 bacterium of swineplague as it was believed to be identical with the microorganism previ ously described by Loffler and by Schutz as the specific cause of SchweineSeuche in Germany The bacilli of hogcholera are short rods with rounded ends averaging X jU  2 M in length anct about o6 y in breadth but forms both longer and shorter than these measurements may occur They are xery actively motile They grow readily on all of the ordinary culture media and best at temperatures between 30 and 38 C They do not liquefy gelatine The growth on gelatine and on agar has a grayish or whitish color often with a bluish trans lucence Bouillon cultures present a diffuse cloudiness with svllitish sediment and without surface membrane The growth on potato assumes generally a brownish or yellowish tint but it may be white and sometimes is indistinct although microscopically the growth isabundant The bacilli are killed by exposure for ten minutes to a temperature of 58 C In coverglass preparations from the fresh juices and tissues of animals dead of hogcholera the bacilli stain readily and for the most part uniformly with ani lineoil gentianviolet If the stained specimen be treated with acetic acid many of the bacilli appear with clear centre and stained margin which may be either uniform or slightly thicker at the poles as described in the reports of the Bureau of Animal Industry Some may present a typical polar staining but they are not re garded as good polar staining bacilli like those of swineplague Various irregularities in staining appear in old cultures The hogcholera bacilli are pathogenic for rabbits mice guinea pigs and pigeons Only the experiments with rabbits will be de scribed here These animals when inoculated subcutaneously with a platinum loop from a pure culture of hogcholera bacilli die usually in from six to eight days but the duration of life may be shorter or longer There is generally considerable dry purulent infiltration at the seat of inoculation the subcutaneous lymphatic glands on the sarne side are enlarged and often present necrotic foci the spleen is swollen as a rule extremely and of a dark red color and firm consistence the liver generally presents yellowish white streaks and dots the heartmuscle is fatty and in some cases ecchymoses necrotic patches and diphtheritic exudation may be found in the intestinal mucosa The bacilli which often occur in clumps are found most abundantly at the seat of inoculation in the affected lymphglands the spleen and the liver and are often so scanty in the blood as to escape detection by microscopical ex amination The statements in the reports of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the effects of these bacilli when inoculated in pigeons have been confirmed by Professor Welch The swineplague bacilli are shorter than the hogcholera bacilli Measuring on the average o8 to I4 y in length they may be very small and present the appearance of slightly oval bodies more like cocci than bacilli or on the other hand they may present them selves as rods of considerable length In appearance and other properties they belong to the same group of organisms as the well known bacteria of chickencholera and of rabbit septicamia They are devoid of independent motion They grow on the ordinary culture media with the exception of potato but at orlinary tem peratures the growth is less rapid and abundant than that of the hogcholera bacilli They do not liquefy gelatine On gelatine and agar the growth is grayish translucent not extending far from the point of inoculation Bouillon cultures are sometimes diSusely cloudy but more frequently the growth is in the form of a whitish rather viscid sediment or in little specks with clear fluid When planted on potato there may be a feeble invisible growth for one or two generations probably due to the transferrence of a little nutritive medium to the potato with the organisms We have not been able to cultivate thern for several generations upon potato They are killed at a temperature slightly lower than that destruc tive to hogcholera bacilli and their vitality in cultures is much shorter than that of hogcholera bacilli  In coverglass preparaDECEMBER 20 I 889 SCIENCE 4I7 double fibrinous pleurisy pericarditis and peritonitis and with very abundant swineplague bacilli in the exudates the blood and the organs Intestinal lesions were absent The injection of o5 of a cubic centimetre of bouillon culture of swineplague bacilli into each lung of another pig was followed by great rapidity and diffi culty of respiration and coughing The animal was killed at the end of a week Double seroEbrinous pleurisy and pericarditis and foci of pneumonia were found The swineplague bacilli were present in abundance The injection of pure cultures of swine plague bacilli with a fine hypodermic needle into the peritoneal cavity was not followed by any manifest effects but in two cases in which laparotomy was performed with antiseptic precautions and pure cultures of swineplague bacilli 65 cubic centimetres were injected into the duodenum the animals died in from sixteen to thirty hours with acute diffuse peritonitis pleurisy and peri carditis and an enormous number of swineplague bacteria in the exudates blood and organs but without intestinal lesions Doubt less some of the culture escaped into the peritoneal cavity Sub cutaneous inoculations in two cases and feeding in four cases of swineplague cultures produced no lesions save localized abscesses and sloughs after the injections   It is evident from these experiments that both the hogcholera bacilli and the swineplague bacilli are pathogenic for sWine that the former when fed or injected into the duodenum even in com paratively small quantity are capable of producing intense diph theritic inflammation and necrosis of the large intestine with gen eral infection and the latter when injected into the thoracic cavity or into the injured peritoneal cavity of causing pneumonia and in flammation of serous membranes If as seems probable from these observations and experiments the hogcholera bacilli are to be regarded as the cause of hog cholera at least of the intestinal lesions how is the failure to find these bacilli in a number of cases of the disease to be explained  A number of possibilities suggest themselves First the bacilli may be confined to the intestine and mixed with so many other bacteria that it is difficult or irnpossible to isolate them Their morphology and the appearance of their colonies are so little characteristic that this might readily happen That this however cannot always be the explanation is errident from the fact that in several instances rabbits inoculated with typical necrotic buttons have survived and cultures and inoculations from other organs have failed to reveal the bacilli of hogcholera Second the bacilli may be confined to the intestine and so modified that they fail to kill rabbits when inoculated subcutaneously These bacilli appear to vary somewhat in their virulence and the possibility suggested cannot at present be disproven Third as in cases of typhoid fever and croupous pneumonia in human beings the specific bacilli may disappear in the later stages of the disease This explanation which is suggested in the reports of the Bureau o f Animal Indus try seems probable but as already mentioned the investigators have not been able to distinguish anatomically cases in which hog cholera bacilli could not be detected from some of those in which they were present It is not clear to them what rdAe is to be assigned to the swine plague bacilli in the natural infections which they have studied The facts that experimentally the swineplague bacillus is capable of causing extensive pneumonia and inflammations of serous mem branes and that epizootics occur in swine in Germany with these as the predominant lesions without intestinal disease suggest that this organism which is apparently identical with that of the Ger man SchweineSeuche is also the cause of a similar affection in this country They are not however aware that any swine epi zootic of pneumonia without any intestinal lesions and with the sole presence of the swineplague bacillus has been observed in this country although cases of this description occur scattered in epizootics of hogcholera with intestinal lesions Until such an epizootic is observed in this country it is not likely that the question will be thoroughlJ elucidated as to the roZe of the swineplague bacilli It is possible that the swineplague bacilli are frequently present in the mouth the airpassages or the intestine of healthy hogs analogous to the frequent presence of the micrococcus of sputumsepticaemia and of pneumonia in the mouth of human beings and that in the mixed infections which have been observed tions from the fresh juices aud tissues ofanimals dead of swine plague inoculations the bacilli present an exquisite and typical polar staining unless the forms are very short when the staining as uniform They are pathogenic for rabbits mice guineapigs pigeons and bats Two degrees of virulence in this organism dhave been met The one kind kills rabbits in from sixteen to thirty hours with enormous multiplication of the bacilli in the blood and organs the other kind destroys life in from two to six days occasionally longer with extensive purulent and serous infil tration at the seat of inoculation often with peritonitis ancI with requently few bacteria in the blood and organs but an immense number in the inflammatory exudates Regarding the distribution in the diseased hog of these two spe ies of bacteria great variety exists which cannot be fully de scribed in this short communication In some cases the hogchol era bacilli have been found abundantly in the blood intestine and a11 of the organs in other cases they have been present only in certain parts most frequently the spleen and liver and absent in other parts They may be absent from the spleen when abundant elsewhere as in the kidney The swineplague bacilli when present likewise vary in differ ent cases in their distribution They are most frequently found in hepatized areas in the lungs but they may also exist in the intes tine the blood and various orgars As regards the frequency with which each of these organisms has been found in the diseased hogs the following groups of cases have been met first herds of diseased swine in which only the hogcholera bacillus has been found second herds in which only the swineplague bacillus was present third herds in which both the hogcholera bacillus and the swineplague bacillus were pres ent in the same animal or the hogcholera bacillus in sorne ani mals and the swineplague bacillus in others of the same herd A ew chiefly scattered cases in which neither the hogcholera nor the swineplague bacillus was found were met e  Professor Welch and his coworkers have not been able to es ablish any constant anatomical differences between the cases in which the swineplague bacilli alone were present and those in which only hogcholera bacilli or both organisms were found While they have frequently found only the swineplague bacilli in extensive hepatized areas in the lungs they have also sometimes found the hogcholera bacilli alone in apparently similar pneu monias They have not met any epizootic Acorresponding to the German SchweineSeuche in which pneumonia existed in anylarge number of cases without intestinal lesions With these results they naturally looked with especial interest to the effects of inoculation of healthy hogs with pure cultures of teach of these organisms The most stringent precautions were ztaken in the selection and care of the experimental hogs Two hogs weighing about 75 pounds not subjected to any pre liminary treatment were fed each 225 cubic centimetres of bouillon eulture of hogcholera bacilli The one died in four and the other in eight and a half days with extensive diphtheritic inflammation and superficial circumscribed necroses of the large intestine with moslerate swelling of the spleen and of the lymphatic glands and with ecchymoses in the lungs and elsewhere Strongyles were Ypresent in the bronchi but there was no pneumonia Hogchqlera bacilli were found in abundance in the blood intestine and organs fln a third hog 65 cubic centimetres of the same bouillon culture were injected with antiseptic precautions into the duodenum Oeath occurred in seven days with the same lesions as in the pre ceding hogs Two hogs exposed in the same pen with the first thog were sick for a number of days and gradually recovered These when killed presented undoubted evidence of the previous existence of acute diphtheritic inflammation of the large intes tine The injection into the thigh and into the lung of 5 cubic centi tnetres of the same bouillon culture in two other hogs produced only localized sloughs with slight constitutional disturbance The hogs were killed at the end of five weeks and hogcholera bacilli were found alive in the sloughs but none elsewhere in the body The injection into the right lung of a pig of 8 cubic centimetres eof a pure bouillon culture of swineplague bacilli was followed in ifrom fortyeight to sixty hours by death with extensive pneumoniaSCIENCE VOL XIV No 359 4 I 8 the widespread diffusion of the swineplague bacilli is due to secondary invasion following infection with the hogcholera bacilli This however does not remove the grave significance of the swine plague bacilli which certainly cannot be ignored in the studies in this country of the diseases knownt as hogcholera or swineplague While differing in some points from the conclusions reached by the workers on this subject in the Bureau of Animal Industry great pleasure is taken in recording the essential harmony of the obser vations here made with the facts which they have observed in their painstaking and creditable investigations of this diEcult subject as reported since the year I885 Through the kindness of Dr F S Billings Professor Welch has had the opportunity of examining a number of cultures from dis eased swine in Nebraska chiefly direct cultures from the spleen These in nearly all instances were pure cultures of the hogcholera bacillus Much confusion has resulted from Dr Billingss attempt to identify this organism with that of SchweineSeuche The former has had the opportunity of examining cuwltures of SchweineSeuche and also of the Scandinavian swinepest obtained from the lIygienic Institute in Berlin The organism in Schweine Seuche cultures is apparently identical with the swineplague bacillus which he has isolated The organism in the swinepest cultures is a different species of bacillus and appears to resemble closely if it is not identical with the hogcholera bacillus It is regarded of importance that the future study of swine af fected with hogcholera or swineplague should be accompanied with a more thorough bacteriological examination of each case than has hitherto been customary The mere production of a direct stabculture from one organ such as the spleen or the mere inoculation of an animal with material from one organ affords very incomplete and unsatisfactory information So long as the rela tions of the two organismsthe hogcholera bacillus and the swine plague bacillus to the diseases of swine are not thoroughly clear it seems necessary to make Esmarch or plate cultures from the blood the intestine and the principal organs of the body and also to inoculate animals with material from the lungs spleen in testine etc A single case thoroughly investigated according to modernbacteriological methods is of more value than many cases in which only stabcultures have been made from one or two organs or in which reliance is placed solely on the results of in oculating animals Little reliance can be placed upon the results of experimental inoculations of swine with the suspected organisms of hogcholera and of swineplague in regions where the disease prevails unless very strict precautions are taken in the selection and care of the experimental animals REJMINATION IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT IN the London MedgsaS Recorder for Nov 20 I889 Dr Ireland summarizes the contents of a paper on this curious phenomenon by Dr Sievers in the Fanska LakaresaZEskag5ets IandEgngar No 5 I 889 This author first gives a rEsumE of the different opinions upon rumination since I6I8 when Fabricius ab Aquapendente published the first case of this affection until the present time He recalls that since the appearance of the classical work by Adrien Dumur on the  Paralysis of the Cardiac Orifice or Merycism the most recent authors see in this affection a nervous moving of the stomach accompanied by more or less diminution of the tone of the cardiac orifice He thinks however that the true nature of rumi nation has not yet been thoroughly studied Like Johannessento whom we owe the most detailed examination of this subject Dr Sievers says that before drawing any conclusion the details should be more minutely studied But while the researches already made do not explain satisfactorily the nature of rumination they furnish us with very important facts for the therapeutic treatment Dr Sievers publishes three cases of rumination which he ob served in private practice at Helsingfors Besides these so far as he knows there are only three other cases of rumination mentioned in Scandinavia and reported by Johannessen in Zegtfsch fr kEgn Medicin Bander X and XII In the first case described the patient aged twentyseven who had been a governess and sicknurse be longed to a very nervous family though none of them suffered from insanity or any other grave disorder She had preariously en joyed good health She always ate very quickly and did not properly masticate her food It is now ten years since she com menced to ruminate her food after a seavoyage lasting from three to four days during which time she had not defecated owing to want of convenience Five ten or thirty minutes after eating the food is collected in little balls in the mouth in order to be subjected to asecond mastication The patient seems quite at ease during rumination After an ordinary dinner the rumination lasts from an hour and a half to two hours If she moves about or even if she is disturbed rumination begins sooner and is more active Trying to restrain the process brings on such distress that the patient is compelled immediately to give in During rumination she prefers to be seated She leans forward and at every mouth ful which returns she lowers her head On scrutinizing the abdomen during the act of ruminating one notices a dimplelike depression under the ribs This is accom panied by an uneasy sensation passing from right tO left This does not extend farther than about the cardiac orifice The patient feels a slight shock and the food returns to the mouth The stomach was found to be moderately distended with air There was no retardation of digestion and no excessive secretion of gas tric juice but there was found to be unusual acidity of the con tents of the stomach owing to the increased production of hydro chloric acid No lactic acid could be detected For this patient Dr Sievers prescribed a teaspoonful of Carlsbad salts before dinner and supper and a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda after each meal The diet was to consist of milk eggs meat and a very little bread Under this treatment there was a gradual im provement and at the end of five weeks the rumination had en tirely ceased nor did it return after she had discontinued using the alkalies The second case was a priest sixty years old He had always ruminated His father now eightyeight did the same The pro cess commenced after a meal and lasted from two to three hours He never tried to stop it and does not think he could as it goes on independently of his will He did not desire medical treatment with a view to remove it The third case was a Jewess thirtyfive years old of a highly neurotic family Her father also ruminated and one brother out of the family of nine occasionally did the same She herself has ruminated from childhood The food returns of itself The act causes her rso uneasiness which would not be the case if she tried to resist it She did not desire medical treatment The contents of the stomach were found to be very acid In La PsichgaZrza Fasc IIIIV there is a paper on  Rumi nation by Dr Cantarano He had opportunities of studying this affection in four idiots two imbeciles and three patients deeply demented No uneasiness seems in these cases to have followed the process Dr Sievers among other contributions to this curious subject refers to the papers of Alt BerZ kn WocAenscA I888 Nos 26 and 27 and of Boas No 3I same journal and in the Archgves de lVeroZogge VII I884 the reader

Syracuse NY re cently Col Albert A Pope of Boston said that the best roads in the world today are those of England France and Germany their excellence being due to the fact that those countries were the first to awaken from the long sleep of the dark ages and that the grow ing rivalry between them necessitated attention to their roads for the proper prosecution of both their military and their mercantile interests In each country the roads early came under the na  tional supervision the results of which are seen in the most splendid highways in existence costing the least to maintain and in

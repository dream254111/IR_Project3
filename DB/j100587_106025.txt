COAST OF ENGLAND IN A LETTER FROM JOHN WALSH ESQ F R S TO THOMAS PEN NANT ESQ F R S CHESTERFIELDSTREET JUNE 23 1774 DEAR SIR TO THE AUTHOR OF THE BRITISH ZOO LOGY IT WILL I AM PERSUADED BE NO UNWELCOME INFORMATION THAT THE TORPEDO OR ELECTRIC RAY FREQUENTS THE SHORES OF THIS ISLAND CONTRARY TO A RECEIVED OPINION AMONG NATURALISTS WHO HAVE IN GENERAL CONSIDERED IT AS AN INHABITANT ONLY OF WARMER CLIMATES REDDE JUNE 23 1774 IN CONSEQUENCE OF INQUIRIES I HAD SET ON FOOT IN SOME OF OUR SOUTHERN FISHING PORTS TWO TORPEDOS TAKEN IN TORBAY ONE IN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST AND THE OTHER IN THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER LAST YEAR HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY SENT UP TO THIS METROPOLIS THE FIRST PROCURED FOR ME BY THE GOOD OFFICES OF MR AMYATT APOTHECARY IN BERKELEY SQUARE ARRIVED DURING MY ABSENCE BUT IT WAS EXAMINED AND THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS WERE SUCCESSFULLY INJECTED BY MR JOHN HUNTER THE SECOND FORWARDED TO ME BY MR GRANT A PRINCIPAL FISHMONGER IN THE LAND CARRIAGE BRANCH THEN AT BRIXHAM CAME UP VERY FRESH AND PERFECT IN ONE OF HIS FISHMACHINES THIS I WEIGHED465 I WEIGHED AND MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS TOUCHED BY THE DISSECTING KNIFE AND FOUND IT TO WEIGH FISTY THREE POUNDS AVOIRDUPOIS AND TO MEASURE FOUR FEET IN LENGTH TWO FEET AND A HALF IN ITS EXTREME BREADTH AND FOUR INCHES AND A HALF IN ITS EXTREME THICKNESS THE LARGEST TORPEDO I MET WITH IN THE NEIGH BOURHOOD OF LA ROCHELLE WHERE UPWARDS OF SE VENTY PASSED THROUGH MY HANDS WEIGHED LITTLE MORE THAN TEN POUNDS AND MEASURED NOT QUITE TWO FEET IN LENGTH NOR QUITE SIXTEEN INCHES IN BREADTH AND THE LARGEST I HAVE READ OF IS THAT MENTIONED BY RHEDI TO LORENZINI A WEIGHING TWENTYFOUR POUNDS WITH OUT DOUBT OF LEGHORN WHICH MAKE ABOUT EIGHTEEN AVOIRDUPOIS THOUGH THIS MEDITERRANEAN TORPEDO HAS BEEN EVER CONSIDERED AS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY SIZE IT IS EXCEEDED IN WEIGHT NEARLY THREE TO ONE BY OUR ENORMOUS BRITISH TORPEDO THE BACK OF IT WAS OF A DARK ASHCOLOUR WITH SOMEWHAT OF A PURPLE CAST BUT NOT AT ALL MOTLED LIKE THOSE OF THE ATLANTIC COAST OF FRANCE NOR REGULARLY MARKED WITH EYES AS THEY HAVE BEEN CALLED LIKE SOME FOUND IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ITS UNDER PART WAS WHITE SKIRTED HOWEVER WITH THE SAME ASH COLOUR WHICH TOWARDS ITS TAIL BECAME ALMOST UNI VERSAL THE SIDE FINS BEING A LITTLE CONTRACTED AND CURLED UP PREVENTED THE PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF ITS BREADTH BUT IT APPEARED TO HOLD THE GENERAL PROPOR TION OBSERVED IN THOSE OF LA ROCHELLE THAT IS THE BREADTH WAS TWOTHIRDS OF THE LENGTH B ITS ELECTRIC A LORENZ OSS INTOR ALLE T ORP P 4 B THE BREADTH OF THE RAYTORPEDO OF BRAZIL IS ACCORDING TO MARCGRAVE JUST ONETHIRD OF THE LENGTH FALLING IN WITH THE PROPORTION OF THE SQUATINORAIA SEE MARCG LIB IV CAP 6 VOL LXIV O O O ORGANS466 ORGANS LIKEWISE WERE PROPORTIONATE WITH THEIRS EACH ORGAN MEASURING FIFTEEN INCHES IN EXTREME LENGTH AND EIGHT IN EXTREME BREADTH IN SHORT THE TOR PEDO OF TORBAY NO WAY DIFFERED FROM THOSE I SAW IN THE BAY OF BISCAY BUT IN SIZE AND COLOUR AND PER HAPS THIS DIFFERENCE MAY BE THOUGHT RATHER CASUAL THAN DENOTING A SPECIFIC DISTINCTION IT WAS A FEMALE WITHOUT ANY SIGNS OF PREG NANCY THE INTESTINES CONTAINED WITH SOME BLACK SLIME TWO VERTEBRES OF A FISH SEEMINGLY OF THE COD KIND THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS OF THIS TORPEDO WERE LIKEWISE INJECTED BY MR HUNTER THOUGH NOT WITH HIS FIRST SUCCESS FROM THE BURSTING OF THE ARTERY IN THE OPERATION HE DETERMINED HOWEVER THE NUM BER OF COLUMNS IN ONE ORGAN TO AMOUNT TO 1182 AND FULLY CONFIRMED THE OBSERVATION HE FORMERLY MADE THAT THEIR NUMEROUS HORIZONTAL PARTITIONS WERE VERY VASCULAR SHALL I TAKE NOTICE THAT THE REST OF THIS FISH WAS DRESSED AND BROUGHT TO TABLE AND THAT SOME OF MY FRIENDS SUFFERED A LITTLE FOR THEIR CURIOSITY IN TASTING IT RONDELET SPEAKS UNFAVOURABLY OF THE TORPEDO AS FOOD AND TELLS US THAT AT VENICE THE PREFECT OF HEALTH FORBIDS IT TO BE SOLD IN THE MARKET BUT TO DEEM IT WHOLESOME DIET WE HAVE THE SANCTION OF HIPPOCRATES AS WELL AS GALEN AND IF FORBID AT VENICE WHEN RONDELET WAS THERE IN THE MARKETS OF FRANCE I KNOW IT TO BE SOLD THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ELECTRICAL ORGANS WHICH MAKE ONE HALF OF THE ANIMAL ARE THOUGH WHOLESOME TO BE EATEN AN INSIPID MUCILAGE BUT ITS MUSCULAR PART IS AT LEAST AS PALATABLE AS THE FLESH OF THE OTHER RAYS AMONG THESE THE OLD AND OVERGROWN ARE EVER IN LITTLE REQUEST OUR TORPEDO WAS 7467 WAS DOUBTLESS SUCH AND WE MUST BESIDE CONFESS THAT AS A RARITY IT HAD BEEN KEPT TOO LONG THE FIRST TORPEDO WAS NOT WEIGHED BUT MR HUNTER WHO EXAMINED BOTH ASSURED ME THAT THEY APPEARED TO HIM EQUAL IN SIZE AND ALIKE IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT INDEED THEIR ELECTRICAL ORGANS PRE SERVED TO THIS HOUR SHEW THEM TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SAME MAGNITUDE THE FIRST WAS A FEMALE LIKEWISE AND NOT PREGNANT THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTS WERE RECEIVED FROM BRIX HAM CONCERNING TORPEDOS FOUND IN THAT QUARTER FROM MR PHILIP LYDE SURGEON AT BRIXHAM WHO FORWARDED THE FIRST ON THE 4TH OF AUGUST 1773  I SEND A TORPEDO OR NUMBFISH WHICH HAD  WHEN LIVING THE GREATEST EFFECT AS I AM INFORMED  BY THE MEN WHO CAUGHT IT THERE HAVE BEEN  THREE TAKEN THIS WEEK THE ONE SENT SEEMS TO BE  OF THE LARGEST SIZE IN AN EARLIER ACCOUNT DATED THE 23D JUNE IT IS MENTIONED THAT ONE OR TWO ARE CAUGHT THERE EVERY WEEK FROM MR GRANT FISHMONGER WHO SENT THE SECOND TORPEDO ON THE 3D NOVEMBER 1773  THE TORPEDO OR NUMBFISH IS BY NO MEANS  PLENTY IN THESE PARTS AS IT RARELY HAPPENS THAT  MORE THAN ONE IS TAKEN AT A TIME NOR CAN THE  PROPER SEASON FOR CATCHING THEM BE ASCERTAINED AS  THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN AT ALL TIMES OF THE YEAR THE  USUAL DEPTH OF WATER IN WHICH THEY ARE CAUGHT IS  FROM THIRTYSIX TO FORTY FATHOM AND BEING OF THE  RAY KIND THEY ARE COMMONLY TAKEN WITH THEM  AS TO THE TIME WHEN THEIR YOUNG ARE TO BE SEEN NO  SATISFACTORY INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED BUT IT IS O O O 2  IMAGINED468  IMAGINED THAT THE SEASON FOR THEM AND THE RAYS IS  THE SAME THEIR NUMBING QUALITY IS PRETTY STRONG  THROUGH THE NET THOUGH MUCH WEAKER THAN WHEN  THEY ARE TAKEN OUT THE GENERAL NAME BY WHICH  THEY ARE KNOWN HERE IS THE NUMB OR CRAMPFISH  FEW OR NO SMALL TORPEDOS ARE TO BE MET WITH IN  THESE PARTS THOSE HITHERTO CAUGHT BEING FROM TEN  TO SIXTY SEVENTY AND EIGHTY POUNDS WEIGHT  WHICH MAY PROBABLY PROCEED FROM THE YOUNG  BEING THROWN AWAY PROMISCUOUSLY WITH OTHER OFFAL  FISH AT LA ROCHELLE DURING THE INTIRE MONTH OF JULY MOST OF THE LARGER FEMALE TORPEDOS BEING THOSE FROM FIFTEEN INCHES TO TWO FEET IN LENGTH WERE FOUND WITH AN UNCERTAIN NUMBER OF EGGS IN THEIR MATRICES THE LARGEST FEMALES APPEARING TO HAVE THE GREATEST NUM BER THE EGGS OF THE SAME FEMALE DIFFERED LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER AS TO FORWARDNESS NOR DID THE EGGS OF ONE FEMALE DIFFER MUCH FROM THOSE OF ANOTHER THE EMBRYO IN ALL WAS BUT LITTLE ADVANCED A LETTER FROM M SAUNIER OF LA ROCHELLE WRITTEN ABOUT SIX WEEKS AFTER I HAD LEFT THAT PLACE INFORMED ME THAT ON THE 10TH SEPTEMBER HE OPENED A VERY LARGE TORPEDO OF ABOUT TWO FEET AND A QUARTER BY ONE AND A HALF AND DISCOVERED FLATING IN THE LEFT MATRICE NINE FETUSES QUITE FORMED NEAR TWO INCHES LONG AND DISTINCT FROM THEM NINE EGGS IN NO STATE OF FORWARD NESS AND THAT IN THE RIGHT MATRICE HE MET WITH FOUR SUCH FETUSES AND NINE SUCH EGGS THE OBSER VATION THEREFORE OF ARISTOTLE THAT THE TORPEDO BRINGS FORTH AT THE AUTUMNAL EQUINOX IS WELL FOUNDED NOTWITHSTANDING LORENZINI HAS QUESTIONED THE FACT FROM THE REMARKABLE SUPERFETATION IN THIS INSTANCE WE MAY BESIDES INSER THAT THE TORPEDO AGREEABLY TO469 TO ARISTOTLES INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CARTILAGI NOUS FISH IN GENERAL GOES WITH YOUNG NEAR SIX MONTHS AS THE EGGS HERE FOUND SEEM FROM THEIR BEING SO LITTLE ADVANCED IN SO LATE A TIME OF THE YEAR TO BE DESTINED FOR THE SPRINGBROOD LORENZINIS DISSECTIONS OF FEMALE TORPEDOS BIG WITH EGGS IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH AND OF OTHERS WITHOUT ANY IN APRIL SHEW THAT THEY PRODUCE ABOUT THE VERNAL AS WELL AS AU TUMNAL EQUINOX THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE MANY YOUNG TORPEDOS WE MET WITH IN THE MONTH OF JULY FROM FOUR AND A HALF TO SIX INCHES LONG WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY THE OFFSPRING OF THAT YEAR AMONG THESE HOWEVER WAS ONE TAKEN ON THE 4TH JULY WEIGHING ONE OUNCE AND MEASURING FOUR INCHES AND A HALF BY THREE WHICH HAD STILL ITS NATIVE YOLK UNCONSUMED IN ITS ABDOMEN BY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IT APPEARS THAT THERE MAY BE A PRODUCTION LIKEWISE AT MID SUMMER BUT OUR GENERAL OBSERVATIONS LED US TO CON CLUDE THAT IT PRINCIPALLY TAKES PLACE AT THE TWO EQUI NOXES I HAVE DWELT THE LONGER ON THE SEASON IN WHICH FOREIGN TORPEDOS BRING FORTH AS WE ARE YET ENTIRELY IGNORANT ON THAT POINT WITH REGARD TO THOSE OF OUR COLDER CLIMATE AND AS THIS KNOWLEDGE MAY IN SOME DEGREE ASSIST US IN KNOWING WHEN AND WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE ANIMAL MOST FISH WE ARE TOLD AP PROACH THE SHORE IN THE SUMMER SEASON AND THE TORPEDO WILL DOUBTLESS THEN IN QUEST OF FOOD AND OF A WARMER ELEMENT BOTH FOR ITSELF AND FOR ITS YOUNG HAUNT THE SHOAL WATER IN THE COLD AND TEM PESTUOUS PART OF THE YEAR WE SHALL PROBABLY FIND IT IN A DEEPER SEA WHICH THEN AFFORDS IT THE MORE MILD AND STILL RETREAT MY LEARNED FRIEND DR GEORGE BAKER HAS PROCURED FOR ME A DRAWING AND SOME ACCOUNT OF A TORPEDO TAKEN470 TAKEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS SINCE IN MOUNTS BAY IN CORN WALL THE PARTICULARS AS THEY WERE LATELY COLLECTED BY MR SCOBELL OF PENZANCE FROM THE FISHERMAN WHO TOOK IT ARE THESE  THAT HE JUDGED IT ON ME  MORY TO HAVE WEIGHED ABOUT FORTY POUNDS AND TO  HAVE BEEN ABOUT THREE FEET LONG AND TWO AND A HALF  BROAD THAT ITS SKIN WAS SMOOTH LIKE AN EEL DARK  BROWN ON THE BACK AND WHITE UNDERNEATH AND  THAT IT HAD BEEN CAUGHT WITH A LARGE HOOK IN THE  MONTH OF MARCH ON SANDY GROUND FOR THE SAKE OF OPPIANS FINE DESCRIPTION OF THE CAPTURE OF THE TORPEDO WHICH CLAUDIAN HAS ELEGANTLY PARAPHRASED AND WHICH YOU STRUCK WITH THE PASSAGE HAVE RENDERED IN ENGLISH METRE I AM GLAD THE TOR PEDO IS FOUND TO TAKE THE HOOK THAT DESCRIPTION THOUGH THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FABULOUS PROVES TO BE NO LESS JUST IN EACH CIRCUMSTANCE THAN AS IT WAS ALWAYS CONFESSED TO BE POETICALLY BEAUTIFUL IN THE WHOLE BUT TO CATCH WITH THE GREATEST SUCCESS THE TORPEDO AS WELL AS OTHER FLAT FISH WHICH KEEP NEAR THE GROUND THE TRAWL OR DRAGNET MUST BE USED THIS KIND OF FISHING IS MUCH PRACTISED IN TORBAY BUT IN MOUNTS BAY AS I AM INFORMED NOT YET ADOPTED WHICH MAY BE THE CHIEF REASON WHY THE TORPEDO HAS BUT SELDOM BEEN TAKEN AT THE ONE AND SO VERY FRE QUENTLY AT THE OTHER PLACE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY LAST AUTUMN OF MAKING A SHORT VISIT TO DUNGARVAN IN IRELAND WHERE SMITH IN HIS HISTORY OF WATERFORD AS YOU HAVE REMARKED MEN TIONS A TORPEDO OF SIX OR EIGHT POUNDS TO HAVE BEEN FOUND ABOUT THIRTY YEARS SINCE THE FISHERY THERE WHICH IS VERY CONSIDERABLE IS WHOLLY CARRIED ON WITH HOOK AND LINE AND THE FISHERMEN WERE ENTIRE STRANGERS TO THE TORPEDO BUT AT RING A FISHING VILLAGE471 VILLAGE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD FURNISHING ABOUT FOUR TEEN OR FIFTEEN SMALL VESSELS WITH WHICH THEY PRAC TISE POLETRAWLING THE FISHERMEN WERE ACQUAINTED WITH IT THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY SOMETIMES CAUGHT ONE OR TWO IN A YEAR AND SOMETIMES NONE FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS THAT THEY HAD TAKEN TWO THAT YEAR AND ONE THE YEAR PRECEDING THAT THESE WERE ABOUT EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG AND FOURTEEN BROAD AND WERE CAUGHT A LEAGUE OFF SHORE THAT THE FISH BENUMBS THOSE WHO TOUCH IT AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN BE NUMBED BY IT AND THAT ITS NAME IN IRISH IS AUNGHELLAW FROM THIS NAME IT MIGHT SEEM THAT THEY CONFOUNDED IT WITH THE ANGELFISH BUT BY THEIR DESCRIPTION BOTH OF THE ANIMAL AND ITS EFFECTS IT WAS PLAIN THEY KNEW AND MEANT THE TORPEDO TO PROVE THE ELECTRICAL EFFECT OF THE ANIMAL THE CURIOUS SHOULD BE INFORMED NOT ONLY WHERE TO FIND BUT HOW BEST TO PRESERVE IT ALIVE THE ELECTRIC RAY IS SO FAR AMPHIBIOUS AS TO EXIST IN AIR TWENTYFOUR HOURS IN FRESH WATER IT SURVIVES BUT LITTLE LONGER WELLBOATS KEPT IN SALT WATER AND NOT PUT INTO MUCH MOTION MAY BEST SUIT IT IN RESERVOIRS ON SHORE WHICH ON SEACOASTS ARE NOT UNFREQUENT IT WILL BE SUBJECT TO BE ANNOYED NOTWITHSTANDING ITS ELEC TRICAL ARMOUR BY THE SEALEACH AND THE COMMON SEACRAB A COMMODIOUS WELLBOAT WE EXPERIENCED MIGHT SOON BE MADE FROM A SMALL FLATBOTTOMED BOAT TERMED BY THE FRENCH POUSSEPIED WHICH PARTI TIONED WITH LATHS INTO THREE OR FOUR CHAMBERS AND SECURED IN THE SAME MANNER AT THE TOP KEPT FLOATING FROM ITS LEAKY STATE JUST EVEN WITH THE WATER IN THIS PEN WE WERE ABLE TO PRESERVE THEM SEVERAL DAYS AND ALWAYS WITHOUT FOOD FOR THOUGH IN THE STOMACH OF THESE472 THESE ANIMALS WHEN TAKEN A PLAICE OR SURMULLET MAY AS WE HAVE SEEN BE FOUND YET IN CONFINE MENT THEY NEGLECT ALL KINDS OF PREY IT WILL BE EASY HOWEVER AS THEY ARE OF A QUIET NATURE TO FORCE THEM TO SWALLOW FOOD IF NECESSARY BUT THE FREQUENT AND PERHAPS FAVOURITE SITUATION OF THE TORPEDO IS TO LIE IN CONCEALMENT UNDER SAND IF HE BE PLACED BY DESIGN AS HE IS SOMETIMES LEFT BY ACCIDENT IN ANY HOLLOW OF A SANDY BEACH FROM WHENCE THE TIDE HAS JUST RETIRED HE SWIMS TO THAT BRINK WHERE THE WATER IS STILL DRAINING AWAY AND ON FINDING HIMSELF UNABLE AFTER REPEATED AT TEMPTS TO PUSH HIMSELF OVER THE SHALLOW AND FOLLOW THE COURSE OF THE TIDE HE BEGINS WITH ADMIRABLE ADDRESS TO BURY HIMSELF IN THE SAND AND BY A GENTLE BUT QUICK FLAPPING OF HIS EXTREMITIES ALL ROUND SOON SINKS HIMSELF A BED AND IN THE ACTION THROWS THE SAND IN A LIGHT SHOWER OVER HIS BACK NEITHER THE ANIMAL NOR THE SPOT HE IS IN CAN NOW BE DISTINGUISHED SAVE ONLY THAT ON A NICE SEARCH HIS TWO SMALL INSPI RATORY FORAMINA AND THEIR MEMBRANES AT PLAY MAY BE PERCEIVED IT IS IN THIS SITUATION THAT THE TORPEDO GIVES HIS MOST FORCIBLE SHOCK WHICH THROWS DOWN THE ASTONISHED PASSENGER WHO INADVERTENTLY STEPS ON HIM I HAVE THUS SHEWN THAT GREAT BRITAIN TOO CLAIMS THE TORPEDO OR ELECTRIC RAY THAT OURS IS THE BROAD MARINE SORT WHICH SOCRATES AS MENO THOUGHT RESEMBLED AND THAT IT IS THE BLACK TORPEDO WHOSE INFLUENCE SUBDUES OBSTINATE HEADACHS AND THE GOUT ITSELF C IN ANNOUNCING TO OUR NATURALISTS AND C SCRIBONIUS LARGUS CAP 1  41 SEE ALSO SEVERAL OF THE EARLY PHYSICIANS ROMAN AND ARABIAN FOR DIFFERENT CURES ATTRIBUTED BY THEM TO

apparatus and its prod ucts is being pursued by Mr C C Speidel and the writer to determine its structure and function which is supposed to have some rela tion to the electric apparatus of the skates even if it does not prove to be the motor nerve cells of this apparatus ULRIC DAHLGREN THE EFFECT OF STORAGE IN RIVER WATER STERIL IZED ON THE PRODUCTION OF ACID IN CARBOHYDRATE SOLUTIONS BY THE BACILLUS COLI GROUP DURING the last decade the fermentation of the various carbohydrates with the production of acid and gas has been used almost exclu sively for dividing the Bacillus coli group into many subdivisions Theobald Smith 1893 seems to have been the pioneer in this field by his division of the colon group by the use of saccharose Of the later workers Win slow and Walker 1907 and MacConkey 1905 seem to have done the most careful work MacConkey divided the Bacillus coli group into four subgroups by the use of dulcite and saccharose according to the following scheme Saccharose Dul cite B coli communis    B coli communior    B coli aerogenes   B coli acidi lactici  In 1909 MacConkey further subdivided the groups by the addition of motility and lique faction of gelatine to his tests Jackson 1911 in America subdivided MacConkeys original scheme by the use of mannite raffinose ni trate reduction indol production motility and other similar reactions The fermenta tion of carbohydrates certainly offers a fruit ful field for the classification of the Bacillus coli group but we must soon decide just what the limits of fermentation must be for the list of carbohydratesi now in use is a long one and increasing steadily The question will soon come to the front Are these fermentations of the various carbohydrates permanent func tions of the organisms  Horrocks 1903 found that members of the Bacillus coli group which were kept in sterilized sewage and Thames River water as well as in well water showed only a weak production of indol and a delayed action on milk Peckham 1897 also found that the production of indol is vari able The purpose of the present work was to determine the permanency of acid production in carbohydrate solutions by the Bacillus coli group in stored river water Three organisms of the original MacConkey scheme were used namely B coli communis acidi lactici aero genes Procedure Water was taken from the Hudson River near the outlets of a sewer and 100 cc was poured into 30 bottles of 250 cc capacity The water was sterilized and the sterilization tested by plating out respective samples Pure agar cultures of B coli communis aero genes acidi lactici were emulsified in steril ized water One cubic centimeter of this emulsion was placed in each bottle thus giving ten bottles of communnis acidi lactici and aerogenes These bottles were stored away in a dark closet at 20 C At various intervals inoculations were made into the carbohydrate solutions and titrations made at the end of the twentyfourth hour or as near as possible to that period During the course of the experi ment the following carbohydrates were used Dextrose lactose raffinose saccharose salicin maltose and mannite The carbohydrates and other media used during the work were made according to stand ard methods of water analysis report of 1905 Liebigs Meat Extract 3 grams to the liter was used in place of meat and gave entirely satisfactory results The method used in titrating the cultures followed standard meth ods in detail Five cubic centimeters of the carbohydrate solution to be tested and 45 cubic centimeters of distilled water were placed in a casserole and boiled briskly for 1 minute One cubic centimeter of phenolphthalein was added as indicator and titration was made into the hot solution with N20 NaOH All re sults are expressed in per cent normal All cultures were incubated at 37 C and titrated at the twentyfourth hour Controls were run SCIENCE 863N S VOL XL No 1041 in all cases The author wishes to thank Meyer M Harris for the

very little effect upon the amount of acid pro duced in dextrose lactose saccharose maltose mannite salicin and raffinose by various mem bers of the Bacillus coli group i e Bacillus coli communis aerogenes and acidi lactici which indicates that production of acid is a permanent characteristic of the Bacillus coli group The slight decline of acid production may be due to diminished vitality of the organ isms as a result of long storage in the water WM W BROWNE THE COLLEGE OF THE CITY OP NEW YORK THE WASHINGTON MEETINGS OF THE AS SOCIATION OF AMERICAN AGRICUL TURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERIMENT

J100693,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16651678,101622,AN ACCOUNT OF SOME BOOKS,I206870,AN ACCOUNT OF SOME BOOKS I TRACTS WRITTEN BY THE HONOURABLE ROBERT BOYLE OF A DIS COVERY OF THE ADMIRABLE RAREF ACTION OF THE AIR EVEN WITHOUT HEAT NEW OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE DURATION OF THE SPRING OF THE AIR NEW EXPERIMENTS TOUCHING THE CON DENSATION OF THE AIR BY MEER COLD AND ITS COMPRES SION WITHOUT MECHANICAL ENGINS AND THE ADMIRABLY DIF FERING EXTENSION OF THE SAME QUANTITY OF AIR RARIFYED AND COMPRESSED LONDON FOR H HERRINGMAN 1670 IN 4 THE MAIN DRIFT OF THESE EXCELLENT TRACTS IS TO INVITE THE CURIOUS TO OBSERVE THE STUPENDIOUS MUTABILITY OF THE AIR AS TO RARITY AND DENSITY WHEREBY THE SAME QUANTITY OF AIR BEING SOMETIMES COMPRESSD SOMETIMES DILATED MAY CHANGE ITS DIMENSIONS TO A DEGREE THAT SEEMS ALMOST TO TRAN SCEND THE POWER OF NATURE AND ART AND MIGHT BE LOOKT UPON AS INCREDIBLE IF IT WERE ABRUPTLY AND NAKEDLY PROPOSED OR BY A PERSON OF ONLY COMMON SKILL IN THESE MATTERS IT2053 IT WILL THEN APPEAR BY THE EXPERIMENTS AND CALCULATION MADE BY OUR NOBLE AUTHOR THAT ACCORDING TO THE LEAST ESTI MATE OF ANY RECITED IN THEM THE EXTENSION OF THE SAME QUAN TITY OF AIR IS AS 1 TO 2744 OR THEREABOUTS AND IF INSTEAD OF THE MODERATEST THERE BY TAKEN THE GREATEST EXPANSION OF THE AIR BEING AS ABOUT 13000 TO 1 WHEN THE UNCOMPREST AIR WAS HIGHLY RARIFYD THAT NUMBER BEING MULTIPLYED BY 40 BECAUSE OF THE GREAT COMPRESSION OF THE AIR EFFECTED BY COLD AS AP PEARS IN THE THIRD OF THESE TRACTS WILL AMOUNT TO 520000 FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES BY WHICH THE AIR AT ONE TIME EXCEEDS THE SAME PORTION OF AIR AT ANOTHER TIME WHICH IS AN EXPAN SION SO GREAT THAT IT WILL EASILY KEEP THE READER FROM THINKING THE TITLE OF THIS DISCOURSE WHERE THE RAREFACTION OF THE AIR IS CALLD ADMIRABLE IMMODEST IT WILL ALSO APPEAR BY THESE TRACTS THAT THE AIR MAY BY THE INTERVENTION OF ART AND INSTRUMENTS BE MUCH MORE EXPANDED THAN IT HAS YET BEEN FOUND TO BE BY THE BARE APPLICATION OF EXTERNAL HEAT THOUGH IT WERE THAT OF AN INTENSE FIRE IT SELF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL DOUBTLESS UPON THE READING OF THIS STRANGE EXPANSION OF THE AIR BE EXCITED TO CONSIDER WHEN HE SHALL LOOK ON ONE OF OUR AUTHORS WELL EXHAUSTED RE CEIVERS HOW SMALL A PROPORTION THE COMMON AEREAL PARTICLES WHICH ARE VERY SPARINGLY DISPERSD THERE BEAR TO THE WHOLE CAVITY OF THE VESSEL WHICH BEFORE IT WAS EXHAUSTED WAS THOUGHT TO BE REPLENISHT WITH AIR ALONE CERTAINLY BOTH THE CARTESIANS AND EPICUREANS WILL FIND THEMSELVES HIGHLY CON CERND IN THIS MATTER THE FORMER WILL ENDEAVOR THEREBY TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSITY OF THEIR MATERIA SUBTILIS TO MAINTAIN THE PLENITUDE OF THE WORLD AND THE CIRCLE THEY ATTRIBUTE TO MO VING BODIES THE LATTER WILL THINK THEY HAVE CAUSE HERE TO TRIUMPH AS BELIEVING TO HAVE MET WITH A MORE ILLUSTRIOUS IN STANCE THAN EVER OF THEIR VACUUM COACERVATUM WITHIN THE WORLD SINCE HERE IS AN IMPENETRABLE VESSEL OUT OF WHICH TIS MANIFEST THAT AN ALMOST INCREDIBLE PROPORTION OF AERIAL SUB STANCE

YEARS AT ROME THAT IT HATH BEEN HIS CUSTOME TO ADVISE HIS SCHOLARS FIRST TO READ OVER THE DEFINITIONS THE TITLES OF PRO POSITIONS AND TO EXERCISE THEMSELVES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF PROBLEMS WITHOUT BEING SOLICITOUS OF THE TRUTH OF THE PROPO SITIONS OR CONSTRUCTIONS UNTIL THEY BECOME FAMILIAR AND AFTER THEY ARE SOMEWHAT CONVERSANT WITH THE GEOMETRICK ASSERTI ONS AND PHRASES THEN TO DOUBT OF THEIR TRUTH AS MUCH AS THEY PLEASE AND STUDY THEIR DEMONSTRATION THE SAME IN THE PROEME THINKING IT CONVENIENT TO BEGIN WITH QUANTITY TREATS OF IT ABSTRACTLY AS VOID OF SUCH AFFECTIONS AND MODES AS ARE CONGRUENT THERETO 1 IN HIS FIRST CHAPTER HE GIVETH DEFINITIONS POSTULATESAND AXIOMES 2 IN THE SECOND BECAUSE ONE QUANTITY IN RELATION TO ANO THER IS SAID TO HAVE A RATIO OR PROPORTION HE TREATS OF RATIOS AND DELIVERS THE DOCTRINE OF THE FIFTH BOOK OF EUCLID TO WHICH ARE ANNEXED 7 QUESTIONS ABOUT GEOMETRICAL PROPORTIONS WITH THEIR SOLUTIONS CLEARING UP THE DEBATES THAT THROUGH THE MISTAKES OF SOME LATE AUTHORS HAVE RISEN ABOUT RATIOS 3 HE TREATS OF ANGLES AND OF THE AFFECTIONS OF ANGLES IN PLAIN RIGHTLINED FIGURES AND AT THE END OF THIS CHAPTER HE STATES THE QUESTION WHETHER AN ANGLE BE A

TO DO IN HIS NEW EUCLID TO RENDER GEOMETRY CLEARER AND EASIER BY DELIVERING SUCH DEMONSTRATIONS AS PROVE THE THING IN HAND BY DIRECT AND INTRINSICK PRINCIPLES NOT SUCH AS ARE INDIRECT AND LEADING AD ABSURDUM  IMPOSSIBILE WHEREBY TIS ONLY CONCLUDED THAT THE THING CANNOT BE FALLE BUT NOT SHEWN WHY IT IS AND MUST BE TRUE IN REFERENCE TO WHICH HE CONSIDERS THAT WHEREAS GEO N N METRY2056 METRY CONSISTS IN DEMONSTRATING THE PROPRIETIES OF QUANTITY THERE IS NO SUCH PROPRIETY BUT IT BELONGS TO IT BY SOME GENUINE AND INTRINSICK PRINCIPLEEASILY TO BE FOUND OUT BY THE ANALYSIS OR GENESIS OF QUANTITY BY WHICH WAY HE JUDGETH THAT GEOMETRY MAY BE EXCEEDINGLY CONTRACTED FORASMUCH AS VERY MANY THINGS SEPARATELY DEMONSTRATED IN THE RECEIVED WAY MAY THEN BE EVINCED JOYNTLY BY ONE PLAIN AND EASY DEMONSTRATION CON SIDERING THAT WHERE THE SAME PROPRIETY BELONGS TO VARIOUS QUANTITIES AND FIGURES FROM THE SAME INTRINSICK PRINCIPLE WHE THER THEY BE PLAIN OR SOLID OR RIGHT LINED OR CURVE OR MIXT NOTHING HINDERS BUT THAT PROPRIETY MAY BE DEMONSTRATED OF THEM ALL BY ONE ONELY DEMONSTRATION AND HENCE THIS AUTHOR IS INCLINABLE TO LAY ASIDE THOSE MANY DIVISIONS OF GEOMETRY AS ARE MADE BY AUTHORS VIZ INTO TRI GONOMETRY PLANOMETRY AND STEREOMETRY AND PECULIAR AND PRO LIXE TREATISES OF CONICAL SECTIONS OF THE SPHAERE AND CYLINDER OF LINES OF DIVERS KINDS OF PLAIN AND SPHAERICAL TRIANGLES OF A SOLID ANGLE OF PROPORTIONS AND PROPORTIONALITIES C E STEEMINGTHAT A MORE CONVENIENT DIVISION WILL SERVE HIS DESIGN WHENCE HE COMPRISETH THIS WHOLE SYNOPSIS IN TWO PARTS THE FIRST TREATS OF THE ELEMENTS FOR BEGINNERS AND CONTAINS 6 PARTS IN THE FIRST WHEREOF ARE DELIVERD THE DEFINITIONS AND EXPLICATIONS OF TERMS THE AXIOMS AND POSTULATA IN THE SE COND ARE EXPLAIND THE GENESIS AND ANALYSIS OF FIGURES AND THEIR DIFFERENT CLASSES IN THE THIRD ARE DEMONSTRATED THE ELE MENTS OF LINES AND ANGLES IN THE FOURTH IS TREATED OF RATIOS AND PROPORTIONS IN THE FIFTH ARE CONSIDERED THE PRODUCTS OF THE SEGMENTS OF A LINE MULTIPLYED INTO ONE ANOTHER IN THE SIXTH ARE HANDLED THE REMAINING ELEMENTS IN THE OTHER HE PROCEEDS TO THE DEMONSTRATION OF HIGHER AND ABSTRUSER THINGS AND THIS PART HE DIVIDETH INTO SEVERAL CLASSES EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS ALL ITS HOMOGENEAL FIGURES RIGHT LIND OR CURVE SOLID OR NOT SOLID THERE BEING SO MANY SEVERAL RANKS AS THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF THEIR GENERATION THESE CLASSES ARE HERE DISTRIBUTED INTO TWO SORTSTHE ONE CONTAINS THOSE FIGURES WHOSE GENERATING QUANTITY IS DRAWN EITHER INTO THE WHOLE ALTITUDE OR INTO ITS RATIONAL OR COMMENSURABLE SEG MENT FOR THE AEQUATION OF THE FIGURE THE OTHER IS OF THOSE WHOSE GENERATING QUANTITY CAN ONLY BE DRAWN INTO AN IRRATIO NAL2057 NAL LINE FOR AEQUATION BUT HE ADDS THAT IT OFTEN FALLS OUTTHAT ONE AND THE SAME FIGURE BELONGS TO SEVERAL CLASSES IN REGARD THAT IT MAY BE RESOLVED INTO DIVERS ELEMENTSOR HAVE MORE THAN ONE GENITRIX AND THEREFORE ACCORDING TO THE VARIETY OF THE GENITRIX MAY BE DIVERSLY GENERATED AND THIS HE ESTEEMS DOTH VERY MUCH COMMEND HIS METHOD IN REGARD THAT THERE IS THE SAME AEQUATION OF THE SAME FIGURE WHETHER IT BE DEMON STRATED IN THIS OR THAT CLASSIS BY THIS INTRINSICK PRINCIPLE MEAN TIME THIS AUTHOR DENYETH NOT THAT THIS KIND OF DIRECT METHOD WAS BEFORE HIM DELIVERD AND PUBLISHT BY BONAVENTURA CAVALERIUS BUT ADDS THAT IT WAS DONE WITH SUCH DIFFICULTIES AND OBSCURITIES AS DETERRED YOUNG STUDENTS FROM IT WHICH IN THIS SYNOPSIS ARE SAID TO BE AVOIDED OR REMOVED AS TO THE THREE OPUSCULA ADJOYNED TO THE SYNOPSIS THE AU THOR AFFIRMS OF THE FIRST THAT IT WAS PUBLISHT ELEVEN YEARS SINCE BUT UNCORRECTEDLY NOW REPRINTED MORE CAREFULLY AND WITH A DESIGN TO GIVE A SPECIMEN OF HIS NEW METHOD IN THAT AB STRUSE ARGUMENT ADDING WITHAL THAT FOR OUGHT HE KNOWS HE IS THE FIRST THAT HATH WRITTEN OF THIS SUBJECT ONLY HE HAD SEEN SOME FEW THINGS CONCERNING THE CYCLOID IN TORRICELLIUS IN THAT APPENDIX WHICH HE SUBJOYND TO THE PROBLEM OF THE DI MENSION OF THE PARABOLA WHERE HE VERY WELL DEMONSTRATES THAT THE SPACE CONTAINED BY THE CYCLOID AND BASIS IS TRIPLICATE TO THE GENERATING CIRCLE BUT OUR AUTHOR AFFIRMS TO HAVE HERE ADDED MANY NEW DEMONSTRATIONS ALLEDGING THAT TORRICELLIUS IN THE SAID APPENDIX HATH DEMONSTRATED NOTHING ELSE BUT THAT ONE THING JUST NOW RECITED AND THOUGH THE SAME IN HIS FIRST BOOK DE MOTU GRAVIUM DOTH PROPOSE MANY EXCELLENT THINGS OF THE CYCLOID YET OUR AUTHOR OBSERVETH THAT HE HATH DEMONSTRA TED NONE OF THOSE CONCERNING THE SECOND OPUSCLE VIZ THE CENTURY OF HIS PROPOSITIONS DE MAXIMIS  MINIMIS HE AFFIRMS TO HAVE WRIT TEN THEM FOR HIS DIVERTISEMENT

CERNING LIGHT AND THAT GREAT CONTROVERTED POINT WHETHER IT BE A BODY AND WHETHER REFLECTION AND REFRACTION PROVE IT TO BE SUCH C AGAINST THE SECOND HE WRITETH ABOUT MOTION AND PERCUSSION WHERE MANY THINGS ARE DISCUSSED AS WHETHER MOTION BE PRODUCED OR TRADUCED WHETHER THE IMPETUS OF THE LEAST BODY MAY MOVE THE GREATEST BODY WHETHER THE FORCE OF PERCUSSION BE A CERTAIN ACTION OF COMPRESSION IN THE IMPEL LENT BODY WHAT ARE THE LAWS OF TWO PROJECTED BODIES EQUAL OR UNEQUAL OF EQUAL OR UNEQUAL VELOCITY WHETHER THE TIMES OF THE VIBRATIONS OF DIFFERENT PENDULUMS ARE IN A SUB DUPLICATE PROPORTION

WHOLE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A VAST AND BULKY BODY AND WHY AN HATCHET CLEAVETH WOOD WHEREAS A VERY HEAVY WEIGHT LAID ON AN HATCHET FIXED IN WOODDOTH NOT WHAT IS THE PRIN CIPLE OF THE MOTION OF RESTITUTION AND MANY MORE AGAINST THE THIRD HE WRITETH ABOUT THE ASCENT OF LIQUORS IN SLENDER TUBES TO WIT WHETHER THAT RISING PROCEEDS FROM THE GRAVI TATION OF THE AIR OR FROM ITS COMPRESSION ONLY PRESCINDED FROM ITS WEIGHT WHETHER LIQUORS DO RISE EQUALLY HIGH IN LONGER AND SHORTER TUBES BUT OF EQUAL BORE C THE TWO LAST DIALOGUES CONTAIN MISCELLANIES AS OF THE IM PETUS INNATE IN BODIES ASSIGNED

j100693,Philosophical Transactions 16651678,101622,An Account of Some Books,i206870,An Account of some Books I TRACTS written by the Honourable Robert Boyle of a Dis covery of the Admirable RAREF ACTION of the AIR even without Heat New Observations about the DURATION of the SPRING of the AIR New Experiments touching the CON DENSATION of the Air by meer COLD and its COMPRES SION without Mechanical Engins And the admirably DIF FERING EXTENSION of the same Quantity of Air rarifyed and compressed London for H Herringman 1670 in 4 THE main drift of these Excellent Tracts is to invite the Curious to observe the stupendious Mutability of the Air as to Rarity and Density whereby the same Quantity of Air being sometimes compressd sometimes dilated may change its Dimensions to a degree that seems almost to tran scend the power of Nature and Art and might be lookt upon as incredible if it were abruptly and nakedly proposed or by a person of only common skill in these matters It2053 It will then appear by the Experiments and Calculation made by our Noble Author that according to the least Esti mate of any recited in them the Extension of the same Quan tity of Air is as 1 to 2744 or thereabouts And if instead of the moderatest there by taken the greatest Expansion of the Air being as about 13000 to 1 when the uncomprest Air was highly rarifyd that number being multiplyed by 40 because of the great Compression of the Air effected by Cold as ap pears in the Third of these Tracts will amount to 520000 for the number of times by which the Air at one time exceeds the same portion of Air at another time Which is an Expan sion so great that it will easily keep the Reader from thinking the Title of this Discourse where the Rarefaction of the Air is calld Admirable immodest It will also appear by these Tracts that the Air may by the Intervention of Art and Instruments be much more expanded than it has yet been found to be by the bare application of External Heat though it were that of an Intense Fire it self The Natural Philosopher will doubtless upon the reading of this strange Expansion of the Air be excited to consider when he shall look on one of our Authors well exhausted Re ceivers How small a proportion the Common Aereal particles which are very sparingly dispersd there bear to the whole Cavity of the Vessel which before it was exhausted was thought to be replenisht with Air alone Certainly both the Cartesians and Epicureans will find themselves highly con cernd in this matter The former will endeavor thereby to establish the necessity of their Materia subtilis to maintain the Plenitude of the World and the Circle they attribute to Mo ving Bodies The latter will think they have cause here to triumph as believing to have met with a more illustrious In stance than ever of their Vacuum Coacervatum within the World since here is an impenetrable Vessel out of which tis manifest that an almost incredible proportion of Aerial sub stance hath been made to issue whereas tis no ways manifest to any of our senses that any other Body hath got in to succeed in its room II ELEMENTA2054 II ELEMENTA GEOMETRIAE PLANAE Authore AEgidio Francisco de Gottignies Bruxellensi Soc Jesu in Collegio Ro mano Matheseos Professore Romae 1669 in 12 THis Author in a Monitum to the Students of Geometry intimates that he hath read Mathematicks more than 7 years at Rome that it hath been his custome to advise his Scholars first to read over the Definitions the Titles of Pro positions and to exercise themselves in the Construction of Problems without being solicitous of the truth of the Propo sitions or Constructions until they become familiar and after they are somewhat conversant with the Geometrick Asserti ons and Phrases then to doubt of their truth as much as they please and study their Demonstration The same in the Proeme thinking it convenient to begin with Quantity treats of it abstractly as void of such affections and modes as are congruent thereto 1 In his first Chapter he giveth Definitions Postulatesand Axiomes 2 In the second because one quantity in relation to ano ther is said to have a Ratio or Proportion he treats of Ratios and delivers the doctrine of the fifth Book of Euclid to which are annexed 7 questions about Geometrical Proportions with their Solutions clearing up the debates that through the mistakes of some late Authors have risen about Ratios 3 He treats of Angles and of the affections of Angles in plain Rightlined Figures And at the end of this Chapter he states the question Whether an Angle be a Quantity shewing that Clavius affirms all Angles to be quantities Peletarius de nyes the Angle of Contract to be a quantity Tacquet condemns both denying any Angle to be a quantity to whom our Au thor assents and on this Hypothesis removeth 5 Paradoxes that are natural to the other assertion And whereas a late Writer alledgeth that it may be pleaded to be the opinion of the Antients he saith that among the Learned moderns it is now refuted herein siding with Gregory of St Vincent Ayns comb Tacquet and Dr Wallis 4 He treats of Rectangles 5 Of2055 5 Of Triangles and Rightlined Figures 6 Of Circles where he delivers the Doctrine of the third Book of Euclid and imitating Archimedes enlargeth this Chapter with other propertys which he had first shewn to be congruent to Rightlined Figures 7 He treats of Problemes by which a Preparation is made to pass from Speculation to Use and Practice The Author having thus altered Euclids order giveth an Index to shew where the Propositions of the 1235 and 6th Book of Euclid are to be found in these Elements He hath passed over all the Propositions of the 4th Book of Euclid as superfluous in his method In that Book tis known that Euclid teacheth How to Inscribe or Circumscribe somebut not any Regular Figures about a Circle Of this he treats at the end of the 7th Chapter This Doctrine is either necessary for Practice as in Fortification or in order to the Construction of the Canon of Sines He intends to treat of Trigonometry and Practical Geometry elsewhere saying in his Dedication Euclidem ex novo adornare studui brevi tamen scriptione con cinnatum ut esset opportunior Ex quo tanquam ex fundamento pendet reliqua mearum doctrina tractationum quas praelo paratos me habere probe nosti As to his method of Demonstration he saith Demonstrationes vix alias pono quam affirmativas ut dis centibus constetea quae proponuntur non tantum vera esse sed etiam cur vera sint in Euclide non pauca per negativas demonstratio nes probantur vel in his probandis negative tanium probata as sumuntur  An recte omnia nonnulli controvertunt III SYNOPSIS GEOMETRICA cum Tribus Opusculis De LINEA SINUUM  CYCLOIDE De MAXIMIS  MI NIMIS Centuria Et SYNOPSIS GEOMETRIAE PLANAE AuthHonorFabry SJesu Lugduni Galliarum 1669 in 12 o THis Author in this Geometrical Synopsis hath endeavourd as M Gottignies just now taken notice of promiseth to do in his New Euclid to render Geometry clearer and easier by delivering such Demonstrations as prove the thing in hand by direct and intrinsick Principles not such as are indirect and leading ad absurdum  impossibile whereby tis only concluded that the thing cannot be falle but not shewn why it is and must be true In reference to which he considers that whereas Geo N n metry2056 metry consists in demonstrating the proprieties of Quantity there is no such propriety but it belongs to it by some genuine and intrinsick principleeasily to be found out by the Analysis or Genesis of Quantity By which way he Judgeth that Geometry may be exceedingly contracted forasmuch as very many things separately demonstrated in the received way may then be evinced joyntly by one plain and easy Demonstration con sidering that where the same propriety belongs to various quantities and figures from the same intrinsick Principle whe ther they be Plain or Solid or Right lined or Curve or Mixt nothing hinders but that propriety may be Demonstrated of them all by one onely Demonstration And hence this Author is inclinable to lay aside those many Divisions of Geometry as are made by Authors viz into Tri gonometry Planometry and Stereometry and peculiar and pro lixe Treatises of Conical Sections of the Sphaere and Cylinder of Lines of divers kinds of Plain and Sphaerical Triangles of a Solid Angle of Proportions and Proportionalities c e steemingthat a more convenient Division will serve his Design whence he compriseth this whole Synopsis in two parts The First treats of the Elements for Beginners and contains 6 parts In the first whereof are deliverd the Definitions and Explications of Terms the Axioms and Postulata In the se cond are explaind the Genesis and Analysis of Figures and their different Classes In the third are demonstrated the Ele ments of Lines and Angles In the fourth is treated of Ratios and Proportions In the fifth are considered the Products of the Segments of a Line multiplyed into one another In the sixth are handled the remaining Elements In the Other he proceeds to the Demonstration of higher and abstruser things and this part he divideth into several Classes each of which contains all its homogeneal figures Right lind or Curve Solid or not Solid there being so many several Ranks as there are different ways of their Generation These Classes are here distributed into two sortsthe one contains those Figures whose Generating quantity is drawn either into the whole Altitude or into its Rational or Commensurable Seg ment for the AEquation of the Figure the other is of those whose Generating quantity can only be drawn into an Irratio nal2057 nal Line for AEquation But he adds that it often falls outthat one and the same Figure belongs to several Classes in regard that it may be resolved into divers Elementsor have more than one Genitrix and therefore according to the variety of the Genitrix may be diversly generated And this he esteems doth very much commend his Method in regard that there is the same AEquation of the same Figure whether it be demon strated in this or that Classis by this Intrinsick Principle Mean time this Author denyeth not that this kind of direct Method was before him deliverd and publisht by Bonaventura Cavalerius but adds that it was done with such difficulties and obscurities as deterred young Students from it which in this Synopsis are said to be avoided or removed As to the Three Opuscula adjoyned to the Synopsis the Au thor affirms of the First that it was publisht Eleven years since but uncorrectedly now Reprinted more carefully and with a design to give a Specimen of his new Method in that ab struse Argument adding withal that for ought he knows he is the first that hath written of this Subject only he had seen some few things concerning the Cycloid in Torricellius in that Appendix which he subjoynd to the Problem of the Di mension of the Parabola where he very well demonstrates that the Space contained by the Cycloid and Basis is Triplicate to the Generating Circle But our Author affirms to have here added many new Demonstrations alledging that Torricellius in the said Appendix hath demonstrated nothing else but that one thing just now recited And though the same in his First Book De Motu Gravium doth propose many excellent things of the Cycloid yet our Author observeth that he hath demonstra ted none of those Concerning the second Opuscle viz the Century of his Propositions De Maximis  Minimis he affirms to have writ ten them for his divertisement many years ago And the third which is a Short piece of Trigonometry he saith to have hastily Composed at the sollicitation of an Ingenious Friend to serve Mathematical Beginners IV DIALOGI PHYSICI

Galliarum 1669 in 8 o THis Learnd Jesuit in those Dialogues writeth against Gri maldi Alphonsus Borelli and Montanari who in divers things differ from what he hath written Against the first con cerning Light and that great controverted point Whether it be a Body And whether Reflection and Refraction prove it to be such c Against the second he writeth about Motion and Percussion where many things are discussed as Whether motion be produced or traduced Whether the impetus of the least Body may move the greatest Body Whether the Force of Percussion be a certain action of Compression in the Impel lent Body What are the Laws of two Projected Bodies equal or unequal of equal or unequal velocity Whether the Times of the Vibrations of different Pendulums are in a sub duplicate proportion of their Lengths Whether a Body im pelled being reflected by a Springy and Compressed Body re storing it self be moved and carried back with that Impetus only which it received from the same Whether a Body Ho rizontally projected will at the same time come to the ground as if it had of it self fallen down Perpendicularly Why Bricks are broken by the percussions of an Hammer though they re main whole under the weight of a vast and bulky Body And why an Hatchet cleaveth Wood whereas a very heavy weight laid on an Hatchet fixed in Wooddoth not What is the Prin ciple of the Motion of Restitution And many more Against the third he writeth about the Ascent of Liquors in slender Tubes to wit whether that Rising proceeds from the Gravi tation of the Air or from its Compression only prescinded from its weight Whether Liquors do rise equally high in longer and shorter Tubes but of equal bore c The Two last Dialogues contain Miscellanies As of the Im petus innate in Bodies assigned them by Nature to attain their respective Ends of the Gravitation of the Air and its pres sure downwards to make Vapors ascend of the Variety of Motion in Heavier and Lighter Balls moved on Longer or

in 4 o IN this Learned Treatise of the Sensesthe Author begins from the consideration of the Touch discoursing of the genuin Organ thereof which he maketh to be the soft substance of the Nerve only Nexthe treats of the Sight and its Organ where he largely discusseth the old Controversy of the manner how Vision is made whether by the Reception of the Species or visible rays of the Object or by the Emission of the Spirits of the Eye maintaining the former and resuting the latter Then he pro ceedeth 1 To speak of the nature of Light and Colours e steeming the distinction of Colours into Real and Apparent to be puerile 2 To treat of the Three Refractions of the Lumi nous rays made in the Eye by the several humors thereof 3 To assign the different apertures of the Pupill according to the distance of the object and the degrees of its illumination as also the respective offices of the Chrystallin Vitreous and Aqueous humors and the reason of their position and confi guration2060 gurationc 4 To give the History of the Tunicles and Mus cles of the Eye asserting the Retina to be the formal organ of Vision and Seven Muscles to perform all the motions therein and observing the curious structure and apparatus in all 5 To discourse of the various Distempers of Eyes and to observe that there is scarce any particle of that organ not subject to some peculiar distemper which he very learnedly and accu rately specifies and enlarges upon Thirdly he treats of Hearing and its Organ having premised that the difference of the several Senses consists only in the dif ferent apparatus by which all the sensible Objects are received in one and the same formal organ of the same kindas alsowhat Analogy there is in the structure of the Eye and Ear the Cor nea of the one answering the Membran of the otherthe Water within the Cornea to the Air within the Tympanum the Ciliar ligaments of the Eye relaxing or streightning the Pupill to the Stapes of the Ear capable to be easily moved inward and a lit tle outward Now of this Sense of Hearing he observeth1 The Airreflecting organ answerable to the Refractive organ in the Eye and remarketh the admirableness of its fabrick as also how exactly every vibration of the Air made upon the Drum by the outward Airis by the Labyrinth of the Eye distinguisht from one another 2 The manner how Hearing is performed where occur divers uncommon Observations about the Malle us Incusand Stapes and the three Holes in the Drum as also of the passageby which the cavity of the Drum hath a consent with the Palat c 3 The many distempers of this Organve ry accurately described Fourthly concerning the Sense of Smelling he 1 Taketh no ticethat Vesalius was the firstthat rightly observed the Olfactory Nerves 2 He observeth the Analogy of this Sense to those of Seeing and Hearing 3 Giveth the reason why Doggs Horses and some other Animals excel the rest in the strength of Smel ling 3 Affirms that moisture falls into the Nose not by the Holes of the Os Ethmoidesbut by those that are in the inward corners of the Eyes 4 The Diseases of this Sensewhere the Au thor taketh occasion to commend the Art of Taliacotius in re storing lost Nosesand to confirm the truth of that Practiceper formed by his own Father Fifthly2061 Fifthly touching the Tast he 1 Maketh the Tongue the Or gan of it as it is made up of such a kind of Porous Flesh coverd with such a coat and very plentifully enterwoven with such nerves furnisht with a fine Saliva which being mixed with the meat and drink sinks it into the nerves through the pores of the Coat and so gives different kinds of Tast 2 Compareth this Sense with all the former by observing the Analogy betwixt them 3 Assigneth the difference between Tast and simple Touch 4 Enumerateth the Affections of the T ongueand in sists especially upon the Convulsion and Palsywhich it is subject to Having dispatched his Dissertation about the Five Senses he proceeds to the consideration of the Brain whereof he 1 Ex plains the admirable structure connexion and dependency of its parts 2 Shews the difference of the Animals Spirits from the Vital which he esteems to be only this That the Animal Spirits are Vital Spirits highly rectified refined and perfected in and by the Brain for Sensation 3 Lays open the origine of the Nerves proceeding from that part of the Braincalld Pons Cere bri which he makes to be nothing else but a Congeries or Heap of innumerable Filaments divaricated out of the Solider sub stance of the Brain whence all the Nervesmany of those threds being joyned together take their rise which in their issue out of the Bones either those of the Skull or the Vertebras are inve vested by both Membrans which contain them as well as they do the Brain it self 4 Declaresthat in the said Pons Cerebrifrom whence all the Nerves proceed is transacted the Common Sensati on confidently affirming that whatever motions are made in the Organs of Sense by the Spirits that are in the Nerves they must needs be conveyed into the Principle of the Nerveswhich in his judgment is the Pons and that performed in a moment of time by reason of the continuity of the Spirits from the Sen sorys to the said common Source5Distinguisheth theOperations of the Common Sense from those of the Phancyand Memoryand withal teachethhow the Rational Soul differenceth the Appre hensions of things from those made by Brutes 6 Determins not whether for the Memory the vestigia of things are impressed in the Brain or whether the substance of the Brain be so framed that according to the different agitation of the Spirits it may be contracted or dilated or else whether the Pores or minute Pas sages2062 sages between the medullar Filaments be opendor shutand that more or lessor lastlywhether it bethat the Spirits are variously disposed whilst the Medulla of the Brain remains in the same state 7 Discourseth of Sleep and Waking where he very cu riously observeth firstHow far there is in Sleep a Cessation of Sense and Motion and how Nightwalkings and Respirationtwo very strong Motions are performed in Sleep Secondly What is the immediate cause of that Cessation viz a scanty and alterd influx of the Spirits into the Organs of outward Sense 8 Ascri beth the exact knowledge of the Medulla Spinalis to that excel lent English Physitian and Anatomist Dr Willis 9 Explains the order in which the several Combinations of the Nerves do pro ceed out of the Medullar Mass of the Brain into and through the whole Body 10Concludeth the whole with an Explication of the Affections and Diseases of the Brain and shewsfirst How the various Headaches are caused by the various qualities of the parts that compose the Bloud which being either bilious sulphu reous salin aqueous or terrestrial do accordingly cause lacera ting pricking vellicating or heavy pains Secondly How the Dropsy of the Brain is caused by the copious serosities gatherd between the Membrans of it Thirdly How Ulcers Obstructions and Inflammations are produced FourthlyHow those many Per turbations and Symptoms are occasioned in the Brain as Sadness FearSleepiness Madness Forgetfulness Epilepsys Apoplexys among which two last he finds this difference that an Epilepsy is not necessarily preceeded by any Obstruction an irritation and an offensive afflux to the Sensible parts being able to produce it alonewhereas an Apoplexy never comes without an Obstruction of the Spirits FifthlyHow Palsys are caused viz by an influx of impure Spirits from the Origine of the Nerves into the begin nings of the same Sixthly How Overmuch Watching is occasi oned namely by overhot Spirits as an Unnatural Sleep is produced by thick torpid and cold vapors intermingled with the Spirits c

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012892,THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH AS A MEANS OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,I242644,THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH AS A MEANS OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION BY M B WAITE PATHOLOGIST IN CHARGE FRUIT DISEASE INVESTIGATIONS UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE THE GREAT NEW FEATURE OF THE MODERN PROGRESS IN AGRICULTURE IS THE RAPID INCREASE IN THE UTILIZATION OF SCIENCE AND THE RESULTS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE IN IM PROVING AND PERFECTING AGRICULTURAL METHODS RESEARCH IN AGRICULTURE MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO MAIN CLASSES STRICTLY AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THE FIRST TYPE IS CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH ACTUAL METHODS OF GROWING AND UTILIZING CROP PLANTS WITH ANIMAL PRODUCTION ETC IT TAKES AGRICULTURAL METHODS DEVELOPED EMPIRICALLY AND SUBJECTS THEM TO CRITICAL EXPERI MENTATION IT GATHERS THE METHODS DEVELOPED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD AND TESTS THEM OUT EXPERIMENTALLY UNDER GIVEN CONDI TIONS IT UTILIZES PRECEPTS DEVELOPED IN THE SCIENCES OR RATHER TESTS THEIR AVAILABILITY FOR USE IN ACTUAL PRACTICE BY TRYING THEM OUT IN THE FIELD IT COULD HOWEVER THEORETICALLY BE CARRIED ON IN PART WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM SCIENCE AS A MATTER OF FACT AT THE PRESENT TIMNE IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE INFLUENCED BY SCIENTIFIC DATA ALL SUCH QUESTIONS AS DEPTH AND KIND OF TILLAGE VARIETIES OF CROPS TO BE PLANTED IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES KINDS OF ANIMALS TO USE FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES DEPTH AND DISTANCE AND TIME OF SEEDING AND PLANTING VARIETIES SUITED FOR DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND DIFFERENT PURPOSES ROTA TION OF CROPS KINDS AND AMOUNTS OF FERTILIZERS TO USE TIME AND AMOUNT OF WATER WHEN THIS IS ARTIFICALLY APPLIED AND IN FACT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL THE VARIOUS ROUTINE PRACTICES OF ACTUAL FARMING COME WITHIN ITS SCOPE THE SECOND TYPE IS RESEARCH IN THE SCIENCES WHICH HAVE A DIRECT BEARING ON AND ARE HELPFUL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURAL METHODS THESE SCIENCES ARE PRINCIPALLY CHEMISTRY INCLUDING PHYSIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY PHYSICS INCLUDING SOIL PHYSICS ZO6LOGY IN NEARLY ALL ITS BRANCHES INCLUDING ENTOMOLOGY ANIMAL 40RESEARCH AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL PATHOLOGY BOTANY IN MOST ALL ITS BRANCHES INCLUDING PLANT PHYSIOLOGY PLANT PATHOLOGY AND BACTERIOLOGY AGRICULTURE IS SO BROAD IN ITS SCOPE AND REQUIREMENTS THAT IT UTILIZES IN VARYING DEGREE AND GETS HELP FROM NEARLY ALL THE OTHER ARTS AS WELL AS FROM THE SCIENCES FOR EXAMPLE MODERN AGRICULTURE UTILIZES TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURE MANU FACTURING AND TRANSPORTATION AMONG THE USEFUL ARTS IT ALSO UTILIZES MATHEMATICS ASTRONOMY METEOROLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY AMONG THE SCIENCES IN ADDITION TO THOSE MENTIONED ABOVE IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED BY MANY THAT FARMERS AS A CLASS ARE CONSERVATIVETHAT THEY HESITATE TO TAKE UP NEW IDEAS THIS IS A NATURAL RESULT OF THE OLDTIME EMPIRICAL METHOD THE FARMER WAS COMPELLED TO STICK TO THE TIMETRIED METHODS KNOWN TO BE SUCCESS FUL BY LONG EXPERIENCE ANY OTHER COURSE THAN THIS WAS TO INVITE DISASTER REFERRING AGAIN TO THE STRICTLY AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH WORK NO ONE CAN ACCUSE THE PRESENT INVESTIGATORS IN THIS LINE OF BEING CON SERVATIVE THEY ARE HUNTING FOR SOMETHING NEW ALL THE TIME IN FACT THEY MAY EVEN BE ACCUSED AT TIMES OF BEING TOO ANXIOUS FOR NOVELTIES IN METHODS AND OF NOT GIVING THE PROPER WEIGHT TO THE BEST EMPIRICALLY DEVELOPED PROCEDURES THESE INVESTIGATORS HAVE AT THE PRESENT TIME THREE POSSIBLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION IN PERFECTING AGRICULTURAL ROUTINE PROCESSES FIRST THE OLD LINE EMPIR ICAL METHODS SECOND THE RESULTS OF TESTS WITH GROWING CROPS UNDER MODERN EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS AND THIRD THE DATA AND RESULTS AVAILABLE FROM THE DIFFERENT SCIENCES WE ARE NOW READY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION AS TO WHY SCIENCE HAS ONLY RECENTLY COME TO THE AID OF AGRICULTURE PARTICULARLY WHY CHEMISTRY AND THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES HAVE BEEN OF SO LITTLE USE TO THE FARMER IT SEEMS TO ME THE REAL REASON IS VERY SIMPLE IT IS BECAUSE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCIENCES HAS BEEN SO IMPERFECT AND INCOMPLETE NO ONE KNOWS BETTER THAN THE INVESTIGATING SCIENTIST THE FRAGMENTARY AND INCOMPLETE NATURE OF OUR EXACT KNOWLEDGE THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES TAKE BOTANY FOR INSTANCE HERE IS A SCIENCE WHICH DEALS WITH PLANTS AND WITH PLANT LIFE IN ALL ITS VARIOUS PHASES WHY HAS THE SCIENCE OF PLANTS UNTIL RECENTLY BEEN OF SO LITTLE USE TO THE CULTIVATOR OF PLANTS AND WHY HAS THIS SCIENCE LATELY BEEN UTILIZED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS WITH SUCH SPLENDID RESULTS IT IS BECAUSE THE SCIENCE ITSELF WAS WEAK ONLY 41THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FRAGMENTARY ISOLATED FACTS HERE AND THERE HAD BEEN WORKED OUT ONLY A FEW OF ITS PRINCIPLES HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BACTERIA HAD BEEN KNOWN AND DESCRIBED TO SOME EXTENT SINCE THE DAYS OF EHRENBERG 1830 IT REMAINED FOR PASTEUR IN 1862 TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE THE REAL CAUSE AND NOT THE RESULT OF FERMENTA TION HE DISCOVERED THE FIRST BACTERIAL DISEASE A SILKWORM DISEASE IN 1870 A YEAR OR TWO LATER HE PROVED THAT ANTHRAX OF CATTLE WAS CAUSED BY A BACILLUS BURRILL IN 1878 DISCOVERED THAT PEAR BLIGHT WAS CAUSED BY BACTERIA THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF A BACTERIAL PLANT DISEASE KOCH DISCOVERED THE GERM OF TUBERCULOSIS IN 1884 SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAS BEEN A CONTINUAL STREAM OF NEW AND IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES IN BACTERIOLOGY OF IMMEDIATE AND PRACTICAL BENEFIT TO AGRICULTURE THE FUNGUS DISEASES OF PLANTS HAVE BEEN KNOWN AND DESCRIBED FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS THE NUMBER HAS BEEN ADDED TO CONTINUALLY UNTIL IT RUNS UP INTO THE THOUSANDS MANY SINGLE SPECIES OF BOTH CULTIVATED AND NATIVE PLANTS HAVE FROM FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED FUNGUS ENEMIES ATTACKING THEM NOT UNTIL MILLARDET DIS COVERED THE EFFICACY OF BORDEAUX MIXTURE IN THE CONTROL OF THE VINE MILDEW IN 1883 AND PUBLISHED HIS RESULTS IN 1885 DID WE HAVE A SATISFACTORY AND DIRECT WAY OF KILLING THESE FUNGUS ENEMIES OR PRE VENTING THEIR ATTACKS ON THE HOST PLANT A NEW WORD FUNGICIDE HAD TO BE ADDED TO THE DICTIONARY ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF THE UTILIZATION OF THE VARIOUS SCIENCES IN AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN TO BRING TO NOTICE THE GAPS IN THE SCIENCES THE DEMANDS OF AGRICULTURE THEREFORE FOR NEW KNOWLEDGE IN SCIENCE HAVE ACTED AS A POWERFUL STIMULUS TO SCIENTIFIC MEN TO TAKE UP MANY PROBLEMS WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PASS UNNOTICED IN THIS WAY AGRICULTURE HAS GREATLY STIMULATED CERTAIN LINES OF RESEARCH SUCH AS MANY PROBLEMS IN CHEMISTRY INCLUDING PHYSIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY AND MANY BRANCHES OF BOTANICAL AND ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE PARTICULARLY IN PATHOLOGICAL AND BACTERIOLOGICAL LINES AGRICULTURE THEREFORE HAS NOT ONLY DRAWN HEAVILY ON SCIENTIFIC RESULTS BUT HAS IN TURN ENORMOUSLY STIMULATED INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY IN THESE LINES IN A MUCH MORE DIRECT WAY HOWEVER IT HAS FOSTERED AND ENCOURAGED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BY FINANCING AND SUPPORTING IT IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE IS FAR MORE SCIENTIFIC WORK BEING DONE DURING THE CURRENT YEAR IN BOTANY FINANCED BY AGRICULTURAL APPROPRIATION BILLS THAN ALL THE OTHER RESEARCH BOTANICAL ACTIVITY COMBINED WHETHER AMATEUR 42RESEARCH AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION OR PROFESSIONAL WHAT WE NEED IS MORE REAL SCIENCE THAT I THINK SOON BECOMES APPARENT TO ALL ENGAGED IN ATTACKING PROBLEMS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION CHEMISTRY HAS DONE GREAT THINGS FOR AGRICULTURE IT HAS FURNISHED THE METHODS OF FERTILIZING THE SOIL AND OF SECURING THESE FERTILIZERS FROM THE EARTHPOTASH PHOSPHORIC ACID AND NITROGEN IT HAS HELPED US IN COMPOUNDING A BALANCED COMPLETE FERTILIZER VARYING TO SUIT SOIL CONDITIONS AND CROPS IT TAUGHT US HOW TO FEED A BAL ANCED RATION TO OUR STOCK IT PROVIDED SIMPLE TESTS BY WHICH THE FARMER CAN DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BUTTER FAT IN ANY GIVEN SAMPLE OF MILK AND THUS FURNISHED A GUIDE FOR DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN PRO DUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE ANIMALS CHEMISTRY COMBINED WITH PLANTBREEDING METHODS HAS INCREASED THE SUGAR CONTENT OF SUGAR BEETS BY FURNISHING A METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE HIGH SUGAR CON TENT OF CERTAIN SPECIMENS TO BE USED FOR SEED PRODUCTION IT FUR NISHES THE BASIS OF MUCH AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTATION AND ASSISTS IN NEARLY ALL LINES OF RESEARCH THE SCIENCE OF ZO6LOGY HAS CONTRIBUTED MUCH INFORMATION OF USE TO AGRICULTURE PERHAPS IN NO WAY HAS IT BEEN MORE USEFUL THAN THROUGH THE RESEARCHES ON THE DISEASES OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND THE METHODS OF CONTROLLING OR MITIGATING THESE DISEASES MANY OF THESE DISEASES ARE NOT ONLY CONTAGIOUS TO THE ANIMALS BUT ARE DOUBLY SERIOUS BECAUSE COMMUNICABLE TO MAN ZO6LOGICAL SCIENCE HAS FURNISHED THE BASIS FOR THE ELABORATE SYSTEM OF MEAT INSPECTION OF DAIRY INSPECTION AND OF QUARANTINE OPERATIONS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TUBERCULIN TEST IN ELIMINATING TUBERCULOSIS FROM DAIRY HERDS MAY BE CITED AS A FINE PIECE OF WORK IN SOME ANIMAL DISEASES SUCH AS THE FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE AND SWINE PLAGUE WE ARE STILL IN THE CONDI TION OF NOT ENOUGH SCIENCE IN NEITHER OF THESE CONTAGIOUS DISEASES HAS THE GERM OR THE REAL CAUSE OF CONTAGION BEEN DISCOVERED MEN DELS LAW AND THE PRINCIPLES OF ANIMAL BREEDING WORKED OUT SCIENTIFIC ALLY HAVE GIVEN AN ENTIRELY NEW STATUS TO THIS ART RESULTS CAN BE FIGURED OUT SCIENTIFICALLY BY MATHEMATICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RULES AND A PREDICTION MADE BEFOREHAND AS TO WHAT MAY BE EXPECTED FROM CERTAIN CROSSES THE SCIENCE OF ENTOMOLOGY HAS BEEN OF THE UTMOST UTILITY TO FARMERS IN CROP PRODUCTION IN RECENT YEARS ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY MAY BE SAID TO DATE BACK FOR AT LEAST TWO GENERATIONS THE CONTROL OF INSECT PESTS IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTIONS OF SCIENCE 43THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TO THE FARMER A FEW STRIKING EXAMPLES MAY BE USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE SUCCESS THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN THIS LINE ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO THE POTATO BUG OR COLORADO POTATO BEETLE STARTED IN TO SIMPLY EAT UP OR CLEAN UP THE POTATO CROP OF THIS COUNTRY THE ENTOMOLOGISTS READILY FIXED UP A POISON TO KILL HIM PARIS GREEN EITHER SPRAYED OR DUSTED ON THE POTATO PLANTS QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY SOLVED THE PROBLEM THE CODLING MOTH OR APPLE WORM WAS THOUGHT BY MANY TO ORIGINATE SPONTANEOUSLY WITHIN THE FRUIT THE ENTOMOLOGISTS HAVE TAUGHT US THAT IT IS THE LARVA OF A HARMLESS LOOKING LITTLE GRAY MOTH THEY HAVE WORKED OUT THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE INSECT AND HAVE GIVEN US A SPRAYING ROUTINE WITH ARSENICAL POISONS BY WHICH PRACTICALLY COMPLETE CONTROL IS MAINTAINED THE COMMERCIAL APPLE ORCHARDIST WHO FOLLOWS THE RULES LAID DOWN BY THE ENTOMOLOGISTS CAN NOW ESTIMATE HIS CROP WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY AS FAR AS THIS PEST IS CONCERNED AS SOON AS THE FRUIT HAS SET IN MAY THE APPLE BUYER CAN KNOW THAT HE WILL GET REASONABLY SOUND FRUIT THROUGHOUT THE BARREL FROM A SPRAYED ORCHARD THE GOOD HOUSEWIFE CAN SERVE BAKED APPLES TO HER FAMILY OR GUESTS WITHOUT THE DANGER OF A DISGUSTING AND NAUSEATING WORM BEING FOUND WHEN THE APPLES ARE OPENED ONE CAN NOW EAT RAW APPLES IN THE DARK IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT WITHOUT A REMEDY FOR THIS ONE PEST ALONE COMMERCIAL APPLE CULTURE IN THIS COUNTRY COULD NOT POSSIBLY EXIST IN ANYTHING LIKE ITS PRESENT PROPORTIONS OUR 86000000 BARRELS OF APPLES IN THE CROP OF 1914 COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PRODUCED OR MARKETED WITH THIS PEST CONTROLLED APPLES ARE NOT ONLY SHIPPED TO ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FROM THE APPLE PRODUCING CENTERS BUT ARE SENT ALL OVER THE WORLD THE HESSIAN FLY HAS BEEN KNOWN TO DESTROY HALF TO TWO THIRDS OF THE WHEAT CROP IN THE WHEATGROWING DISTRICTS THE PROBLEM WAS ATTACKED BY THE ENTOMOLOGISTS AND THE LIFE HISTORY OF THIS INSECT FULLY WORKED OUT WITH THE RESULT THAT A PRACTICAL SATIS FACTORY REMEDY WAS DEVELOPED THE UTILIZATION OF WHICH ENTAILS NO ADDITIONAL EXPENSE TO THE FARMER THE REMEDY CONSISTS MERELY IN DEFERRING THE PLANTING OF THE WHEAT UNTIL AFTER THE EMERGENCE AND DEATH OF THE ADULT FLIES THE COTTON BOLLWEEVIL ENTERED THIS COUN TRY FROM MEXICO ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO AND ITS EFFECTS WERE SO SEVERE THAT IT THREATENED THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE COTTON INDUS TRY OF THE UNITED STATES SCIENTIFIC ENTOMOLOGISTS ATTACKED THE PROBLEM VIGOROUSLY AND BY MEANS OF A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE LIFE HISTORY AND HABITS OF THIS PEST FOUND A WAY OF GETTING AROUND 44RESEARCH AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IT IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE CRITICAL PERIOD IN THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE WEEVIL OCCURS DURING THE WINTER IT IS VERY RARE THAT MORE THAN THREE PER CENT OF THE WEEVILS IN THE FIELD IN THE FALL SURVIVE TO ATTACK THE CROP THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE FIRST STEP IS TO GREATLY REDUCE THIS THREE PER CENT BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THE REMAINS OF THE COTTON PLANTS IN THE FALL AFTER THE CROP IS HARVESTED THE ADVANTAGE OBTAINED BY THIS MEANS IS FOLLOWED UP BY PROCURING AN EARLY TYPE OF COTTON PLANTING EARLY AND PUSHING IT TO EARLY MATURITY DURING THE FOLLOWING SEASON BY THIS MEANS PRODUCTION HAS BEEN MAINTAINED FROM 50 PER CENT UNDER UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS TO NEARLY OR QUITE A FULL CROP UNDER FAVORABLE CONDITIONS THE SCIENCE OF BOTANY IS BEING UTILIZED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW METHODS IN AGRICULTURE THAT TO ATTEMPT TO ENUMERATE EVEN THE DIFFERENT LINES WOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARTICLE WITHOUT MINIMIZING THE IMPORTANT RE SULTS THAT ARE BEING SECURED THROUGH THE NEW METHODS OF PLANT BREEDING INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF MENDELS LAW AND OF OTHER METHODS OF CROSSING PLANTS BASED ON SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO INCLUDE THE MANY HELPFUL DISCOVERIES IN PLANT PHYSIOLOGY IT MAY AGAIN BE POINTED OUT AS IN CASE OF ZOOLOGY THAT SOME OF THE MOST MARKED TRIUMPHS HAVE BEEN SECURED IN THE CONTROL OF PLANT DISEASES PARTICULARLY IN CASE OF THE FUNGUS AND BACTERIAL DISEASES PREVIOUS TO 1885 THE FARMER FRUIT GROWER OR GARDENER WAS PRACTICALLY AT THE MERCY OF THE FUNGUS PESTS ON HIS CROPS THE LOSSES ARE STILL VERY LARGE IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT ALL PLANT PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY IS ANNUALLY REDUCED FROM 20 PER CENT TO 25 PER CENT THROUGH PLANT DISEASES AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE FOUNDATION FOR THIS ESTIMATE WHEN WE REALIZE THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH A CROP WORTH ANNUALLY BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ON THE FARM THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS LOSS IS APPALLING ONLY A PART OF THIS CAN OF COURSE EVER BE REACHED AND PREVENTED MANY DISEASES ARE PHYSIO LOGICAL PRODUCED BY THE EFFECT OF CLIMATIC AND SOIL CONDITIONS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE IN THE IRRIGATED REGIONS OF THE WEST NEW TYPES OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DISEASES HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS TROUBLES IN THE ORCHARDS OF DECIDUOUS FRUITS AND IN THE ORANGE GROVES IT MAY TAKE YEARS OF CAREFUL RESEARCH TO EVEN FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF SOME OF THESE TROUBLES AND THEY APPEAR TO BE DIFFICULT TO REMEDY EVEN WHEN THE CAUSE IS THOROUGHLY KNOWN 45THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ON THE OTHER HAND THE FUNGUS DISEASES OF PLANTS HAVE YIELDED TO RESEARCH DURING THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IN A MANNER THAT IS REALLY MARVELOUS THE BLACK ROT OF THE GRAPE A NATIVE DISEASE ON AMERI CAN WILD GRAPEVINES ATTACKED OUR RAPIDLY INCREASING GRAPE INDUSTRY IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES IN THE EARLY 80S THE DISCOVERY OF BORDEAUX MIXTURE IN FRANCE BY MILLARDET WHICH SHOWS THE IN TERNATIONAL CHARACTER AND VALUE OF RESEARCH OPENED UP NEW POSSI BILITIES THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AT WASHINGTON STARTED EXPERIMENTS IN 1886 AND WITHIN THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS GAVE TO THE GRAPE GROWERS A COMPLETE AND SUCCESSFUL ROUTINE TREATMENT BY SPRAYING THROUGH WHICH FROM 95 PER CENT TO 98 PER CENT OF THE CROP COULD BE SAVED THIS TREATMENT IS THE VERY BASIS OF THE GRAPE INDUSTRY WITHOUT IT THE VINES WOULD BEAR ONLY RAGGED AND UN SIGHTLY BUNCHES SCARCELY FIT FOR SHIPPING TO MARKET THE SOLID WELLFILLED BUNCHES OF SMOOTH BRIGHT BERRIES OF OUR AMERICAN GRAPES WHICH ARE SHIPPED BY THE THOUSANDS OF CARLOADS ANNUALLY CAN BE CLAIMED BY PLANT PATHOLOGY AS ONE OF ITS TRIUMPHS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY BY INVESTIGATING THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE FUNGUS PARASITE FINDING OUT ITS TIME AND METHOD OF INFECTION AND BY TESTING WITH SPRAYING MIXTURES MOST OF THE FUNGUS DISEASES OF THE APPLE PEAR AND PEACH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL APPLE SCAB BITTERROT BLACKROT AND LEAFSPOT PEAR SCAB FRUIT SPOT AND LEAFBLIGHT ARE ENTIRELY UNDER CONTROL BY ROUTINE SPRAYING METHODS THE PEACH WITH ITS SERIOUS DISEASE KNOWN AS BROWN ROT AND THE SCARCELY LESS SERIOUS BLACK SPOT OR SCAB FOR A LONG TIME PUZZLED THE PLANT PATHOLOGIST NOT BECAUSE THE CHARACTER OF THE DISEASE WAS MYSTERIOUS BUT BECAUSE THE AVAILABLE COPPER AND SULPHUR FUNGICIDES WERE TOO INJURIOUS TO THE FOLIAGE THE PROBLEM WAS COMPLETELY SOLVED HOWEVER BY THE DISCOVERY OF THE SELFBOILED LIMESULPHUR WHICH CAN BE SPRAYED ON TO THE PEACH WITHOUT INJURY AND WHICH KILLS AND PREVENTS THE FUNGI BY COMBINING THIS AS IN MOST SPRAY TREATMENTS WITH AN ARSENICAL INSECTICIDE SUCH AS ARSENATE OF LEAD A COMPLETE SPRAYING ROUTINE FOR THE INSECT PESTS AND FUNGUS DISEASES OF THIS FINE FRUIT IS NOW AVAILABLE THIS BENEFITS NOT ONLY THE PEACH GROWER BUT EVERY ONE INTERESTED IN THE PEACH BUSINESS AND THE CONSUMER AS WELL THE SPRAYED TREES YIELD A FAR BETTER AND MORE RELIABLE CROP OF HIGHER GRADE MORE PERFECT FRUIT TO THE PEACH GROWER THE PEACHES HANDLE AND SHIP BETTER IN THE REFRIGERATOR CARS AND ARE MORE SATISFACTORY FOR THE WHOLESALER AND JOBBER THE RETAILER FINDS 46RESEARCH AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THAT THE SPRAYED PEACHES STAND UP AND KEEP IN CONDITION FOR A LONGER TIME WHILE HE IS SELLING THEM INSTEAD OR ROTTING ON HIS HANDS AND PROVING A DISAPPOINTMENT AND THE CONSUMER ULTIMATELY GETS MORE LUSCIOUS PEACHES TO EAT PRODUCTION OF POTATOES CANTALOUPES CELERY AND EVEN TOMATOES HAS BEEN GREATLY HELPED THROUGH SPRAYING METHODS DEVISED AGAINST THE FUNGUS PESTS OF THESE VEGETABLE CROPS AND THROUGH OTHER METH ODS OF CONTROL WORKED OUT THROUGH SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THERE IS A FAMILY OF PARASITIC FUNGI THAT ATTACKS MANY SPECIES OF PLANTS PRODUCING DARK POWDERY MASSES OF SPORES IN SUCH ABUNDANCE THAT THEY ARE CALLED THE SMUTS THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF THIS FAMILY ATTACK A GREAT VARIETY OF PLANTS BUT SEVERAL SPECIES ATTACK OUR GREAT CEREAL CROPS THEY PRODUCE A SMUT OF INDIAN CORN AND THE CEREAL SMUTS ONE BOTANIST HAS ESTIMATED THAT THE ANNUAL LOSSES FROM THE CORN AND CEREAL SMUTS IN THIS COUNTRY EXCEED IN AMOUNT ALL THE TAXES THAT ARE COLLECTED BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL FOR MOST OF THESE SMUTS THE SCIENCE OF PLANT PATHOLOGY HAS FURNISHED A COMPLETE AND SATISFACTORY ROUTINE TREATMENT WHICH IS APPLIED AT A VERY SMALL COST IT CONSISTS IN DISINFECTING THE SEEDS IN MOST CASES IT CONSISTS IN SPRINKLING A LITTLE FORMALDEHYDE WATER OVER THE SEEDS AND COVERING THEM WITH SACKS FOR A FEW HOURS IN ONE CASE NOT CONTROLLABLE BY CHEMICAL DISINFECTION NAMELY THE LOOSE SMUT OF WHEAT THE REMEDY CONSISTS IN DIPPING THE SEED FOR THIRTY MINUTES IN HOT WATER AT 130 DEGREES F HOT ENOUGH TO KILL THE FUNGUS BUT NOT TO KILL THE SEED A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IAETHOD NAMELY DIPPING IN FORMALDEHYDE WATER HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE THE REMEDY FOR POTATO SCAB AND FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER POTATO DISEASES THE CONTROL OF PLANT DISEASES HOWEVER IS BY NO MEANS LIMITED TO SPRAYING WITH FUNGICIDES OR TO DISINFECTING THE SEEDS TUBERS CUTTINGS ETC BY CHEMICALS AND OTHERWISE MANY DISEASES ARE CONTROLLED ONLY BY ERADICATION METHODS IN CASE OF THE CONTAGIOUS PEACH YELLOWS THE ENTIRE TREE HAS TO BE PULLED UP AS SOON AS IT IS STRICKEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE REST OF THE ORCHARD AND THE COM MUNITY IN CASE OF PEAR BLIGHT AND APPLE CANKERS A THOROUGH LOCAL ERADICATION OF THE DISEASED SPOT IS NECESSARY BUT NOT THE DESTRUC TION OF THE REST OF THE TREE IN THIS DISEASE WHICH IS BACTERIAL IN ITS NATURE THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE CONTROL METHOD CON SISTS IN FINDING AND ERADICATING THE CASES OF HOLDOVER BLIGHT WHERE THE GERMS LIVE OVER WINTER TO ATTACK THE TREES THE FOLLOWING SPRING 47THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN 1905 PEAR BLIGHT THREATENED TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA PEAR INDUSTRY DURING THE FIVE YEARS PRECEDING IT HAD DESTROYED ABOUT ONETHIRD OF ALL THE PEAR PLANTINGS IN THE STATE THE APPLICA TION OF THESE METHODS WITH HOWEVER ONLY A MODERATE DEGREE OF THOROUGHNESS RESULTED IN SAVING THE GREATER PART OF THE INDUSTRY FROM DESTRUCTION CALIFORNIA STILL SHIPS HER CANNED BARTLETT PEARS ALL OVER THE WORLD MANY OF OUR WORST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE PLANT DISEASES HAVE BEEN IMPORTED FROM THE OLD WORLD SOME LIKE THE CHESTNUT BARK DISEASE AND THE CITRUS CANKER ARE VERY RECENT IMPORTATIONS PLANT PATHOLOGISTS HAVE DISCUSSED FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE ADVANTAGES OF SUPERVISION OVER PLANT IMPORTATIONS FORMERLY WE HAVE HAD NO LAW BY WHICH PLANT DISEASES COULD BE EXCLUDED FROM ENTRY AFTER SOME CONSPICUOUS CASES OF RECENT OCCURRENCE CONGRESS PASSED THE FEDERAL QUARANTINE ACT THIS PROVIDES FOR A BOARD OF SCIENTISTS KNOWN AS THE FEDERAL QUARANTINE BOARD AND GIVES THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE VERY WIDE AUTHORITY IN EXCLUDING NOT ONLY PLANT PESTS BUT THE IMPORTATION OF ANY PLANTS OR SEEDS ETC WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS WE ARE NOW TRYING TO SHUT OUT FROM THIS COUNTRY SEVERAL POTATO DISEASES FROM EUROPE WE ARE ENDEAVORING TO PREVENT FURTHER ENTRANCE OF CITRUS DISEASES BY EXCLUDING THE IMPORTATION OF CITRUS NURSERY STOCK WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP OUT FURTHER IMPORTATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN WHITEPINE BLISTER RUST WHICH THREATENS OUR WHITEPINE FORESTS WITH DESTRUCTION WHATEVER GOOD MAY COME FROM THIS WORK GOES BACK PRIMARILY TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON PLANT DISEASES IN DISCUSSING THE TRIUMPHS OF PLANT PATHOLOGY I OUGHT NOT OVERLOOK SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES AND FAILURES QUITE A NUMBER OF BACTERIAL DISEASES OF PLANTS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BUT IN ONLY A FEW CASES ARE THE REMEDIES OR METHODS OF CONTROL WELL WORKED OUT OR ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY THE ROOT DISEASES OF PLANTS ARE EITHER LITTLE KNOWN OR IF KNOWN LITTLE HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THE WAY OF THEIR PRACTICAL CONTROL IN MANY OF THESE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN PLANT PATHOLOGY INVESTIGATORS HAVE TURNED TO A DIFFERENT METHOD OF ATTACK NAMELY THE BREEDING AND SELECTION OF RESISTANT VARIETIES IN SOME CASES AS IN THE COTTON WILT OF OUR SOUTHERN STATES SIGNAL SUCCESS HAS BEEN OBTAINED I SHOULD NOT HOWEVER CONVEY THE IDEA THAT ALL PLANT DISEASES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL MANY PROBLEMS LIKE THE CROWN GALL OF FRUIT AND OTHER TREES THE ROOT ROTS 48RESEARCH AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION THE NEW CITRUS CANKER THE CHESTNUT BARK DISEASE AND NUMEROUS OTHERS STILL ATTACK VEGETATION UNCHECKED OR ONLY PARTLY CONTROLLED OR IN CASE OF THE CITRUS CANKER CONTROLLED BY HEROIC METHODS SUCH AS BURNING UP THE ENTIRE TREE WHEN ONLY A SINGLE LEAF IS AFFECTED I HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS PAPER CHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE SOIL AT FIRST THAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE IMPORTANT PROBLEM IN SOIL STUDIES LATER IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL WERE AS IMPORTANT OR POSSIBLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION STILL LATER WITHIN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IT HAS BEEN REALIZED BY INVESTIGATORS THAT THE BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL ARE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN EITHER ITS CHEMICAL OR ITS PHYSICAL PROPERTIES THE SOIL UNDER OUR FEET IS TEEMING WITH BACTERIA WITH FUNGI WITH ALGAE AND WITH MICROSCOPIC ANIMAL LIFE CHIEFLY NEMATODES THE SPECIES OF THE LATTER ALONE RUN UP INTO THE THOU SANDS THIS BRANCH OF SCIENCE HAS ONLY BEEN ENTERED UPON IT MAY BE SCARCELY SAID TO HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED AT ALL IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT A CUBIC FOOT OF ORDINARY GARDEN SOIL PRESENTS MORE UN SOLVED PROBLEMS IN BIOLOGY THAN THE ENTIRE SOLVED PROBLEMS UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND THESE PROBLEMS ARE MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE BUILDING OF THE PANAMA CANAL INCLUDING BOTH ITS ENGINEERING AND BIOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENTSMORE DIFFICULT THAN WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY THAN SUBMARINE OR AERIAL NAVIGATION FOR THESE LATTER HAVE IN PART BEEN SOLVED IF WE MAY JUDGE THE FUTURE FROM THE PAST WHILE GREAT THINGS MAY BE EXPECTED FROM SOIL BACTERIOLOGY AND SOIL BIOLOGY DURING THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS AT THE END OF THAT PERIOD NEW PROB LEMS JUST AS IMPORTANT WILL BE CLAMORING FOR SOLUTION ONE STRIK INGLY IMPORTANT THING HAS ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT OUT IN SOIL BACTERI OLOGY IN THIS CASE THE DISCOVERIES ARE PARTLY LINKED WITH PLANT PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES I REFER TO THE NITROGEN ASSIMILATING ORGANISMS IN THE ROOT TUBERCLES OF THE LEGUMINOSAE IT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS THAT CLOVERS AND SOME SIMILARLY RELATED PLANTS POSSESS A REMARKABLE POWER IN RENEWING SOIL FERTILITY WHEN THESE PLANTS ARE PLOWED UNDER FOR THE GROWING OF SUBSEQUENT CROPS IT WAS FINALLY DISCOVERED THAT THIS PROPERTY DEPENDED ON THE PRESENCE OF MINUTE TUBERS OR TUBERCLES THAT OCCUR ABUNDANTLY ON THE ROOTS AND THAT THE REAL FUNCTION WAS PERFORMED BY A TINY BACILLUS WHICH LIVES IN THESE TUBERCLES THE CLOVER PLANT EASILY FURNISHES THE SUGAR AS THE NECESSARY FOOD FOR THE BACTERIA THE BACTERIA LIVING IN THE TUBERCLES ARE ABLE TO FORCE THE FREE NITROGEN OF THE AIR INTO 49THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CHEMICAL COMBINATION AND BUILD UP NITRATES SUBSEQUENTLY READILY CONVERTED INTO PROTEIDS THE MOST VALUABLE FOOD OF BOTH PLANTS AND ANIMALS STILL LATER INVESTIGATIONS HAVE DEVELOPED PRACTICAL METHODS OF ARTIFICIALLY CULTIVATING AND DISTRIBUTING THESE GERMS FOR SOIL INOCULATION A FIELD WHICH HAD NEVER GROWN ALFALFA CANNOT ORDINARILY BE SUCCESSFULLY PLANTED TO THIS CROP WHEN SOIL IS SUPPLIED WITH THE PROPER STRAIN OF THE ROOT TUBERCLE BACILLUS ALFALFA CAN BE AT ONCE SUCCESSFULLY GROWN IN ACTUAL PRACTICE THE GERMS FROM LIQUID CULTURES ARE MIXED WITH A LITTLE PARTLY DRIED SOIL AND THIS IS SOWN OVER THE SURFACE AND IMMEDIATELY HARROWED IN IN SOME CASES THE ALFALFA OR OTHER LEGUMINOUS SEEDS MAY BE COATED WITH THE CUL TURE IN INTRODUCING A NEW LEGUMINOUS CROP LIKE ALFALFA IN MOST SECTIONS OF THE EASTERN STATES SOY BEANS FROM JAPAN HAIRY VETCH AND OTHER SPECIAL CROPS OF THE PEA BEAN AND CLOVER FAMILY THIS PROCESS GIVES US AT ONCE COMMAND OF THE SITUATION IT EXPLAINS THE CAUSE OF MANY FAILURES IN THE PAST THE RESULTS OF THE NEW DISCOVERIES AND THE CONTINUAL INTRODUC TION OF NEW METHODS HAVE BEEN TO PLACE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTATION ON A MUCH HIGHER PLANE IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE NECESSARY FOR THE WORKER ENGAGED IN STRICTLY AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH TO HAVE AT LEAST SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCIENCES TO DRAW INTO HIS SERVICE ALL THEIR AVAILABLE DATA AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH IS GIVING MORE AND MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE USE OF THE HIGHEST BRAINS AND INTELLECT MORE THAN THIS THE FARMER HIMSELF INSTEAD OF LEADING A LIFE OF DRUDGERY OR CARRYING OUT A FEW SIMPLE ROUTINE PROCESSES FINDS HIM SELF ENGAGED IN AN INTELLECTUAL OCCUPATION THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF FRUIT AND TRUCK FARMING AND THE GROWING OF SPECIAL CROPS BUT THE PRINCIPLE PERVADES ALL FARMING WE HEAR MUCH THESE DAYS ABOUT THE AGRICULTURAL UPLIFT THAT IS NOW GOING ON AND THE VARIOUS INFLUENCES THAT ARE BRINGING IT ABOUT I FEEL SURE THAT A CAREFUL ANALYSIS WILL SHOW THAT THE BIGGEST SINGLE FACTOR WHICH IS PRODUCING THIS UPLIFT AND THE GREATEST HOPE FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS MOVEMENT IS THE APPLICATION OF SCIENCE TO THE PROBLEMS OF CROP PRODUCTION 50

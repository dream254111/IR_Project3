J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108259,RESEARCHES IN THE THEORY OF MACHINES,I206996,28  XXI RESEARCHES IN THE THEORY OF MACHINES BY THE REV HENRY MOSELEY MA FRS PROF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND ASTRONOMY KINGS COLLEGE LONDON RECEIVED JUNE 10READ JUNE 18 1841 THE WORK OF A MECHANICAL AGENT MAY BE DEFINED AS THE UNION OF A CONTINUAL PRESSURE WITH A CONTINUAL MOTION THE WORK OF OVERCOMING A PRESSURE OF ONE POUND THROUGH A SPACE OF ONE FOOT IS IL THIS COUNTRY TAKEN AS THE UNIT IN TERMS OF WHICH ANY OTHER AMOUNT OF WORK IS ESTIMATED THE WORK OF ANY PRESSURE OPERATING THROUGH ANY SPACE IS EVIDENTLY MNEASURED IN TERMS OF SUCH UNITS BY MULTIPLYING THE NUMBER OF POUNDS IN THE PRESSURE BY THE NUMBER OF FEET IN THE SPACE IF THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESSURE BE CONTINUALLY THAT IN WHICH THE SPACE IS DESCRIBED IF NOT IT FOLLOWS BY A SIMPLE GEOMETRICAL DEDUCTION THAT IT IS MEASURED BY THE PRODUCT OF THE NUMBER OF POUNDS IN THE PRESSURE BY THE NUMBER OF FEET IN THE PROJECTION OF THE SPACE DE SCRIBEDT UPON THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESSURE THAT IS BY THE PRODUCT OF THE PRESSURE BY ITS VIRTUAL VELOCITY THUS THEN WE CONCLUDE AT ONCE BY THE PRINCIPLE OF VIRTUAL VELOCITIES THAT IF A MACHINE WORK UNDER A CONSTANT EQUILIBRIUM OF THE PRESSURES APPLIED TO IT OR IF IT WORK UNIFORMLY THEN IS THE AGGREGATE WORK OF THOSE PRESSURES WHICH TEND TO ACCELERATE ITS MOTION EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE WORK OF THOSE WHICH TEND TO RETARD IT AND BY THE PRINCIPLE OF VIS VIVA THAT IF THE MACHINE DO NOT WORK UNDER AN EQUILIBRIUM OF THE FORCES IMPRESSED UPON IT THEN IS THE AGGREGATE WORK OF THOSE WHICH TEND TO ACCELERATE THE MOTION OF THE MACHINE GREATER OR LESS THAN THE AGGRE GATE WORK OF THOSE WHICH TEND TO RETARD ITS MOTION BY ONEHALF THE AGGREGATE OF THE VIRES VIVA ACQUIRED OR LOST BY THE MOVING PARTS OF THE SYSTEM WHILST THE WORK IS BEING DONE UPON IT IN NO RESPECT HAVE THE LABOURS OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES MORE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THEORY OF  THE SENSE IN WHICH THE TERM WORK IS HERE USED WILL BE RECOGNISED TO BE THAT IN WHICH  DYNAMICAL EFFECT EFFICIENCY  WORK DONE  LABOURING FORCE C HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY DIFFERENT ENGLISH WRITERS AND MOMENT DACTIVITE QUANTIT6 DACTION PUISSANCE MECANIQUE TRAVAIL BY THE FRENCH AMONG THE LATTER THIS VARIETY OF TERMS HAS AT LENGTH GIVEN PLACE TO THE MOST INTELLIGIBLE AND THE SIMPLEST OF THEM  TRAVAIL THE ENGLISH WORD WORK IS THE OBVIOUS TRANSLATION OF  TRAVAIL AND THE USE OF IT APPEARS TO BE RECOMMENDED BY THE SAME CONSIDERATIONS M DUPIN HAS PROPOSED THE APPLICATION OF THE TERM DYNAME  TO A UNIT OF WORK THE AUTHOR OF THIS PAPER HAS GLADLY SHELTERED HIMSELF FROM THE CHARGE OF ADDING TO THE VOCABULARY OF SCIENTIFIC WORDS BY ASSUMING THE TERM ITSELF UNIT OF WORK TO REPRESENT CONCISELY AND CONVENIENTLY ENOUGH WITHOUT TRANSLATION THE IDEA WHICH IS ATTACHED TO IT T IF THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESSURE REMAIN ALWAYS PARALLEL TO ITSELF THE SPACE DESCRIBED MAY BE ANY FINITE SPACE  IF IT DO NOT THE SPACE IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE SO SMALL THAT THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESSURE MAY BE SUPPOSED TO REMAIN PARALLEL TO ITSELF WHILST THAT SPACE IS DESCRIBED286 PROFESSOR MOSELEY ON THE THEORY OF MACHINES MACHINES THAN IN THE APPLICATION WHICH HE HAS SO SUCCESSFULLY MADE TO IT OF THIS PRINCIPLE OF VIS VIVA  IN THE ELEMENTARY DISCUSSION HOWEVER OF THIS PRINCIPLE WHICH IS GIVEN BY M PONCELET IN THE INTRODUCTION TO HIS MECANIQUE INDUSTRIELLE HE HAS REVIVED THE TERM VIS INERTIE VIS INERTIE VIS INSITA NEWTON AND ASSOCIATING WITH IT THE DEFINITIVE IDEA OF A FORCE OF RESISTANCE OPPOSED TO THE ACCELERATION OR THE RETARD ATION OF A BODYS MOTION HE HAS SHOWN ARTS 66 AND 122 THE WORK EXPENDED IN OVERCOMING THIS RESISTANCE THROUGH ANY SPACE TO BE MEASURED BY ONEHALF THE VIS VIVA ACCUMULATED THROUGH THE SPACE SO THAT THROWING INTO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE FORCES UNDER WHICH A MACHINE WORKS THE VIRES INERTIAS OF ITS MOVING ELEMENTS AND OBSER VING THAT ONEHALF OF THEIR AGGREGATE VIS VIVA IS EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE WORK OF THEIR VIRES INERTIVE IT FOLLOWS BY THE PRINCIPLE OF VIRTUAL VELOCITIES THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE WORK OF THOSE FORCES IMPRESSED UPON A MACHINE WHICH TEND TO ACCELERATE ITS MOTION AND THE AGGREGATE WORK OF THOSE WHICH TEND TO RETARD THE MOTION IS EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE WORK OF THE VIRES INERTIAS OF THE MOVING PARTS OF THE MACHINE UNDER WHICH FORM THE PRINCIPLE OF VIS VIVA RESOLVES ITSELF INTO THE PRIN CIPLE OF VIRTUAL VELOCITIES SO MANY DIFFICULTIES HOWEVER OPPOSE THEMSELVES TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TERM VIS INERTIVE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEFINITIVE IDEA OF AN OPPO SING FORCE INTO THE DISCUSSION OF QUESTIONS OF MECHANICS AND ESPECIALLY OF PRACTICAL AND ELEMENTARY MECHANICS THAT IT HAS APPEARED TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS PAPER DESIRABLE TO AVOID IT IT IS WITH THIS VIEW THAT IN THE RESEARCHES WHICH FORM THE SUBJECT OF THE PAPER NOW SUBMITTED TO THE SOCIETY A NEW INTERPRETATION IS GIVEN TO THAT FUNCTION OF THE VELOCITY OF A MOVING BODY WHICH IS KNOWN AS ITS VIS VIVA ONEHALF THAT FUNCTION BEING INTERPRETED TO REPRESENT THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF WORK ACCUMULATED IN THE BODY SO LONG AS ITS MOTION IS CONTINUED AND WHICH NUMBER OF UNITS OF WORK IT IS CAPABLE OF REPRODUCING UPON ANY RESISTANCE WHICH MAY BE OPPOSED TO ITS MOTION AND BRING IT TO REST A VERY SIMPLE INVESTIGATION WILL ESTABLISH THE TRUTH OF THIS INTERPRETATION OF THE ANALYTICAL FORMULA REPRESENTED BY THE TERM VIS VIVA LET A BODY WHOSE WEIGHT IS W BE CONCEIVED TO DESCEND FREELY BY GRAVITY THROUGH A HEIGHT IHI AND TO ACQUIRE A VELOCITY V IT WILL HAVE BECOME CAPABLE BY REASON OF ITS MOTION OF OVERCOMING A CERTAIN PRESSURE THROUGH A CERTAIN SPACE THAT IS OF YIELDING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORK WHICH AMOUNT OF WORK MAY BE CONCEIVED TO BE ACCUMULATED IN IT THE AMOUNT OF THE WORK WHICH IT HAS BECOME CAPABLE OF YIELDING IS MANIFESTLY THAT WHICH WOULD RAISE ANOTHER BODY OF THE SAME WEIGHT W TO THE SAME VERTICAL HEIGHT HU OR IT IS EQUIVALENT TO A NUMBER OF UNITS OF WORK REPRESENTED BY W H OR SINCE V2  2 G H BY I   V2 THAT IS BY ONEHALF THE VIS VIVA THUS THE WORK ACCUMULATED IN A BODY NOVING WITH THE VELOCITY V IS REPRESENTED BY HALF THE VIS VIVA WHEN THAT VELOCITY IS ACQUIRED BY THE ACTION OF GRAVITY NOW THE WORK ACCUMULATED IN A BODY MOVING  SEE PONCELET MDCANIQUE INDUSTRIELLE TROISIEIME PARTIE T IF A MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCE COULD BE SO INTERPOSED AS TO RECEIVE THE WHOLE OF THE WORK OF THE DESCENDING WEIGHT AND COMMUNICATE IT TO AN EQUAL ASCENDING WEIGHT THIS LAST WOULD MANIFESTLY BE PROJECTED UPWARDS WITH THE SAME VELOCITY WITH WHICH THE FIRST REACHED THE GROUND AND WOULD THEREFORE ASCEND TO THE SAME HEIGHTPROFESSOR MOSELEY ON THE THEORY OF MACHINES 287 WITH THIS VELOCITY V IS MANIFESTLY THE SAME UNDER WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT VELO CITY MAY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED THE EFFECTS WHICH A BODY HAVING A GIVEN WEIGHT AND MOVING WITH A GIVEN VELOCITY IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE WORK WHICH IT IS CAPABLE OF YIELDING BEING MANIFESTLY INDEPENDENT OF THE CAUSES FROM THE OPERATION OF WHICH THAT VELOCITY HAS RESULTED SINCE THEN THE WORK WHICH A BODY IS CAPABLE OF YIELDING WHEN ITS VELOCITY HAS BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE FREE ACTION OF GRAVITY IS REPRESENTED BY THAT FUNCTION OF ITS VELOCITY WHICH WE CALL ONEHALF ITS VIS VIVA IT IS REPRESENTED BY THE SAME FUNCTION WHEN THAT VELOCITY HAS BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE ACTION OF ANY OTHER FORCE OR UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHATEVER AND IF THE WORK WHICH IT IS CAPA BLE OF YIELDING UPON ANY RESISTANCE OPPOSED TO ITS MOTION BE SAID TO BE ACCUMULATED IN IT BEFORE IT ENCOUNTERS THAT RESISTANCE THEN UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES IS THE ACCUMU LATED WORK OF A MOVING BODY REPRESENTED BY ONEHALF ITS VIS VIVA GIVING TO THE TERM VIS VIVA THIS NEW INTERPRETATION THE PRINCIPLE OF VIS VIVA AS APPLIED TO MACHINES MAY BE ENUNCIATED THUS  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE WORK DONE UPON THE MACHINE DURING ANY TIME BY THOSE FORCES WHICH TEND TO ACCELERATE THE MOTION AND THE AGGREGATE WORK DURING THE SAME TIME OF THOSE WHICH TEND TO RETARD THE MOTION IS EQUAL TO THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF UNITS OF WORK ACCUMULATED IN THE MO VING PARTS OF THE MACHINE DURING THAT TIME IF THE FORMER AGGREGATE EXCEED THE LATTER AND LOST FROM THEM DURING THAT TIME IF THE FORMER AGGREGATE FALL SHORT OF THE LATTER THUS THEN IF THE AGGREGATE WORK OF THE FORCES WHICH TEND TO ACCELERATE THE MOTION OF A MACHINE EXCEEDS THAT OF THE FORCES WHICH TEND TO RETARD IT THEN IS THE SURPLUS WORK THAT DONE UPON THE DRIVING POINTS ABOVE THAT EXPENDED UPON THE WORKING POINTS CONTINUALLY ACCUMULATED IN THE MOVING ELEMENTS OF THE MACHINE AND THEIR MOTION IS THEREBY CONTINUALLY ACCELERATED AND IF THE FORMER AGGREGATE BE LESS THAN THE LATTER THEN IS THE DEFICIENCY SUPPLIED FROM THE WORK ALREADY ACCUMULATED IN THE MOVING ELEMENTS OR IT IS LOST BY THEM SO THAT THEIR MOTION IS IN THIS CASE CONTINU ALLY RETARDED 2 THE MOVING POWER DIVIDES ITSELF WHILST IT OPERATES IN A MACHINE FIRST INTO THAT WHICH OVERCOMES THE PREJUDICIAL RESISTANCES OF THE MACHINE OR THOSE WHICH ARE OP POSED BY FRICTION AND OTHER CAUSES USELESSLY ABSORBING THE WORK IN ITS TRANSMISSION SECONDLY INTO THAT WHICH ACCELERATES THE MOTION OF THE VARIOUS MOVING PARTS OF THE MACHINE AND WHICH ACCUMULATES IN THEM SO LONG AS THE WORK DONE BY THE MUOVING POWER UPON IT EXCEEDS THAT EXPENDED UPON THE VARIOUS RESISTANCES OPPOSED TO THE MOTION OF THE MACHINE THIRDLY INTO THAT WHICH OVERCOMES THE USEFUL RESISTANCES OR THOSE WHICH ARE OPPOSED TO THE MOTION OF THE MACHINE AT THE WORKING POINT OR POINTS BY THE USEFUL WORK WHICH IS DONE BY IT NOW THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF UNITS OF USEFUL WORK YIELDED BY ANY MACHINE AT ITS WORKING POINTS IS LESS THAN THE NUMBER RECEIVED UPON THE MACHINE DIRECTLY FROM THE MOVING POWER BY THE NUMBER OF UNITS EXPENDED UPON THE PREJUDICIAL RESISTANCES AND BY THE NUMBER OF UNITS ACCUMULATED IN THE MOVING PARTS OF THE NIACHINE WHILST THE WORK IS BEING DONE FOR IF E U1 RE PRESENT THE NUMBER

ONEHALF THE AGGREGATE DIFFERENCE OF THE VIRES VIVAE OF THE MOVING ELEMENTS REPRESENTS THE WORK ACCUMULATED IN THEM DURING THE PERIOD IN RESPECT TO WHICH THE WORK IS ESTIMATED 3 AT EVERY PERIOD OF THE MOTION OF A MACHINE THERE OBTAINS A RELATION BETWEEN THE MOTION OF EACH ONE OF ITS ELEMENTS AND THAT OF EVERY OTHER ELEMENT SO THAT THE VELOCITY OF EVERY OTHER MOVING ELEMENT OF THE MACHINE MAY AT ANY TIME BE EXPRESSED BY AN ALGEBRAICAL FUNCTION OF THE VELOCITY OF THAT ONE ELEMENT AND THE SPACE TRAVERSED BY IT FROM A GIVEN PERIOD OF THE MOTION THE CONSTANTS ENTERING INTO WHICH FUNCTION ARE DETERMINED BY THE FORMS DIMENSIONS AND COMBINATION OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE MACHINE IF ANY ONE SUCH ELEMENT BE MADE TO MOVE UNIFORMLY THE OTHER ELEMENTS WILL EITHER MOVE UNIFORMLY OR WITH A PERIODICAL MOTION OR SOME OF THEM UNIFORMLY AND OTHERS WITH A PERIODICAL MOTION IN THE FIRST CASE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE MOTION OF EVERY ELEMENT WILL BEAR A GIVEN CONSTANT RATIO TO THAT OF EVERY OTHER IN THE SECOND CASE THAT IT WILL BEAR TO IT A RATIO WHICH WILL BECOME THE SAME AT THE EXPIRATION OF EACH GIVEN PERIOD IT IS EVIDENT MOREOVER THAT THIS GIVEN RATIO BETWEEN THE VELOCITIES OF THE MOVING ELEMENTS

FRICTION AND OTHER PREJUDICIAL RE SISTANCES OPPOSED TO THE MOTION OF THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE MACHINE IT MEASURES IN RESPECT TO EACH SUCH MACHINE THE LOSS OF THE WORK DUE TO THESE CAUSES AND THEREFORE CONSTITUTES A TRUE STANDARD FOR COMPARING THE EXPENDITURE OF MOVING POWER NECESSARY TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE SAME EFFECTS BY DIFFERENT MACHINES AND CWTERIS PA RIBUS A TRUE MEASURE OF THE WORKING QUALITIES OF SUCH MACHINES IT HAS BEEN THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THE RESEARCHES WHICH THE AUTHOR PROPOSES TO SUBMIT TO THE SOCIETY IN THIS AND A SUBSEQUENT PAPER TO DEVELOPE THESE PROPERTIES OF THE MODULUS UNDER A GENERAL FORM TO DETERMINE THE PARTICULAR MODULI OF SOME OF THOSE ELEMENTS WHICH ENTER MOST COMMONLY INTO THE COMPOSITION OF MACHINERY AND TO DEDUCE THE MODULI OF VARIOUS COMPOUND MACHINES BY A GENERAL METHOD FROM THE MODULI OF THEIR COMPONENT ELEMENTS 4 SOLVING EQUATION 2 IN RESPECT TO V2 WE OBTAIN V27122 2G YXU1 MU2  IT IS EVIDENT FROM THIS EQUATION THAT ANY INEQUALITY BETWEEN THE WORK I U1 DONE UPON THE MOVING POINT AND THAT E U2  E U YIELDED UPON THE WORK DONE AND UPON THE PREJUDICIAL RESISTANCES PRODUCES A GREATER OR LESS VARIATION IN THE VELOCITY OF THE MACHINE ACCORDING AS THE QUANTITY REPRESENTED BY  W 2 IS GREATER OR LESS IT IS PROPOSED TO CALL THIS QUANTITY WHICH HAS A DIFFERENT VALUE UNDER EVERY DIFFERENT MECHANICAL COMBINATION AND WHICH IS HERE IT IS

CASE BE DETERMINED AMONGST THESE PRESSURES THERE IS IN EVERY MACHINE INCLUDED THE RESISTANCE OF ONE OR MORE SURFACES DID NO FRICTION RESULT FROM THE PRESSURE OF THE SURFACES OF BODIES UPON ONE ANOTHER THEIR MU TUAL RISTANCE WOULD BE EXER TED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMON NORMAL TO THEIR POINLTPROFESSOR MOSELAEY ON THE THEORY OF MACHINES 293 OF CONTACT WE KNOW HOWEVER BY DAILY EXPERIENCE THAT THE RESISTANCE OF NO TWO SURFACES IS LIMITED TO THIS SINGLEDIRECTION FRICTION PRESENTS ITSELF WHEREVER THE RE SISTANCE OF THE SURFACES OF SOLID BODIES IS EXERTED AND IS IN FACT BUT THE RESOLVED PART OF THAT RESISTANCE IN A TANGENT PLANE TO THE SURFACES AT THEIR POINT OF CONTACT AND FROM THE LAWS WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVED BY EXPERIMENT TO OBTAIN APPROXIMATELY IN RESPECT TO IT IT FOLLOWS THAT WITHIN THE SURFACE OF A CERTAIN CONE CALLED THE CONE OF RESISTANCE WHOSE APEX IS AT THE POINT OF CONTACT OF THE SURFACES WHOSE AXIS COIN CIDES WITH THE NORMAL AND WHOSE ANGLE IS TWICE THAT WHICH HAS FOR ITS TANGENT THE COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION EVERY DIRECTION THAT CAN BE TAKEN IS ONE IN WHICH THE MUTUAL RESISTANCES OF THE SURFACES OF CONTACT IS EXERTED AS PERFECTLY AS IN THE NORMAL DIRECTION IN FACT THAT ANY PRESSURE LESS THAN THAT WHICH PRODUCES ABRASION BEING APPLIED TO THE SURFACE OF AN IMMOVEABLE SOLID BODY BY THE INTERVENTION OF ANOTHER BODY MOVE ABLE UPON IT IS SUSTAINED BY THE RESISTANCE OF THE SURFACES OF CONTACT WHATEVER BE ITS DIRECTION PROVIDED ONLY THE ANGLE WHICH THAT DIRECTION MAKES WITH THE PERPEN DICULAR TO THE SURFACES OF CONTACT DO NOT EXCEED A CERTAIN ANGLE CALLED THE LIMITING ANGLE OF RESISTANCE OF THOSE SURFACES RHHIS IS TRUE HOWEVER GREAT THE PRESSURE MAY BE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ABRASION ALSO IF THE INCLINATION OF THE PRESSURE TO THE PER PENDICULAR EXCEED THE LIMITING ANGLE OF RESISTANCE THEN THIS PRESSURE WILL NOT BE SUS TAINED BY THE RESISTANCE OF THE SURFACES OF CONTACT AND THIS IS TRUE HOWEVER SMALL THE PRESSURE MAY BE A LET P Q REPRESENT THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE SURFACES OF TWO BODIES ARE PRESSED TOGETHER AT Q AND LET Q A BE A PERPENDICULAR  OR NORMAL TO THE SURFACES OF CONTACT AT THAT POINT THEN WILL THE 4  PRESSURE P Q BE SUSTAINED BY THE RESISTANCE OF THE SURFACES HOW EVER GREAT IT MAY BE PROVIDED ITS DIRECTION LIE WITHIN A CERTAIN GIVEN ANGLE A Q B CALLED THE LIMITING ANGLE OF RESISTANCE AND IT WILL NOT BE SUSTAINED HOWEVER SMALL IT MAY BE PROVIDED ITS DIRECTION LIE WITHOUT THAT ANGLE FOR LET THIS PRESSURE BE REPRESENTED IN MAGNITUDE BY P Q AND LET IT BE RESOLVED INTO TWO OTHERS A Q AND R Q OF WHICH A Q IS THAT BY WHICH IT PRESSES THE SURFACES TOGETHER PERPEN DICULARLY AND R Q THAT BV WHICH IT TENDS TO CAUSE THEM TO SLIDE UPON ONE ANOTHER IF THEREFORE THE FRICTION F PRODUCED BY THE FIRST OF THESE PRESSURES EXCEED THE SECOND PRESSURE R Q THEN THE ONE BODY WILL NOT BE MADE TO SLIP UPON THE OTHER BY THIS PRESSURE P Q HOWEVER GREAT IT MAY BE BUT IF THE FRICTION F PRODUCED BY THE PER PENDICULAR PRESSURE A Q BE LESS THAN THE PRESSURE R Q THERE THE ONE BODY WILL BE MADE TO SLIP UPON THE OTHER HOWEVER SMALL P Q MAY BE LET THE PRESSURE IN THE DIRECTION OF P Q BE REPRESENTED BY P AND THE ANGLE A Q P BY G THE PERPENDICULAR

THE AXIS A Q SO C A THAT B Q MAY GENERATE THE SURFACE OF A CONE B Q C THEN DOES THIS CONE EVIDENTLY POSSESS THE PROPERTIES ASSIGNED TO THE CONE OF RESISTANCE  IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS SECTION Q IF THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESSURE P COINCIDE WITH THE SURFACE OF THE CONE IT WILL BE SUSTAINED BY THE FRICTION OF THE SURFACES OF CONTACT BUT THE BODY TO WHICH IT IS APPLIED WILL BE UPON THE POINT OF SLIPPING ON THE OTHER THE STATE OF THE EQUILIBRIUM IS THEN SAID TO BE THAT BORDERING UPON MOTION IF THE PRESSURE P ADMIT OF BEING APPLIED ONLY IN A GIVEN PLANE THERE ARE BUT TWO SUCH STATES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE DIRECTIONS OF P WHICH COINCIDE WITH THE TWO INTER SECTIONS OF THE PLANE WITH THE SURFACE OF THE CONE THESE ARE THE SUPERIOR AND THE INFERIOR STATES BORDERING UPON MOTION THUS THEN IT FOLLOWS CONVERSELY THAT WHEN ANY PRESSURE APPLIED TO A BODY MOVEABLE UPON ANOTHER WHICH IS FIXED IS SUSTAINED BY THE RESISTANCE OF THE SURFACES OF CONTACT OF THE BODIES AND IS IN EITHER STATE OF THE EQUILIBRIUM BORDERING UPON INO TION THEN IS THE DIRECTION OF THAT PRESSURE AND THEREFORE OF THE OPPOSITE RESISTANCE OF THE SURFACE INCLINED TO THE NORMAL AT A GIVEN ANGLE THAT CALLED THE LIMITING ANGLE OF RESISTANCES S IF ANY NUMBER OF PRESSURES P1 P2 P3 C APPLIED IN THE SAME PLANE TO A BODY MOVEABLE ABOUT A CYLINDRICAL AXIS BE IN THE STATE BORDERING UPON MOTION THEN IS THE DIRECTION OF THE RESISTANCE OF THE AXIS INCLINED TO ITS RADIUS AT THE POINT WHERE IT INTERSECTS ITS CIRCUMFERENCE AT AN ANGLE EQUAL TO THE LIMITING ANGLE OF RESISTANCE FOR LET R REPRESENT THE RESULTANT OF P1 P2 C THEN SINCE THESE FORCES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE UPON THE POINT OF CAUSING THE AXIS OF THE BODY TO TURN UPON ITS BEARINGS THEIR RESULTANT WOULD IF MADE TO REPLACE THEM BE ALSO UPON THE POINT OF CAUSING THE AXIS TO TURN ON ITS BEARINGS HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE DIRECTION OF THIS RESULTANT R CANNOT BE THROUGH THE CENTRE C OF THE AXIS FOR IF IT WERE THEN THE AXIS WOULD BE PRESSED BY IT IN THE  RHE

PERPENDICULARLY UPON ITS BEARINGS AND COULD NOT BE MADE TO TURN UPON THEM BY THAT PRESSURE OR TO BE UPON THE POINT OF TURNING UPON THEM THE DIRECTION OF R MUST THEN BE ON ONE SIDE OF C SO AS TO PRESS THE AXIS UPON ITS BEARINGS IN A DIRECTION R L INCLINED TO THE PERPENDICULAR C L AT THE POINT L WHERE IT INTERSECTS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE AXIS AT A CERTAIN ANGLE R L C MOREOVER IT IS EVIDENT BY THE LAST ARTICLE THAT SINCE THIS FORCE R PRESSING THE AXIS UPON ITS BEAR INGS AT L IS UPON THE POINT OF CAUSING IT TO SLIP UPON THEM THIS INCLINATION R L C OF R TO THE PERPENDICULAR C L IS EQUAL TO THE LIMITING ANGLE OF RESISTANCE OF THE AXIS AND ITS BEARINGS NOW THE RESISTANCE OF THE AXIS IS EVIDENTLY EQUAL AND OPPOSITE TO THE RESULTANT R OF ALL THE FORCES P1 P2 C IMPRESSED UPON THE BODY THE RESISTANCE ACTS THEREFORE IN THE DIRECTION L R AND IS INCLINED TO C L AT AN ANGLE EQUAL TO THE LIMITING ANGLE OF RESISTANCE IF THE RADIUS C L OF THE AXIS BE REPRESENTED BY G AND THE LIMITING ANGLE OF

THE CONDITIONS OF THE EQUILIBRIUM OF ANY NUMBER OF PRESSURES IN THE SAME PLANE APPLIED TO A BODY MOVEABLE ABOUT A CYLINDRICAL AXIS IN THE STATE BORDERING UPON MOTION LET P1 P2 P3 C REPRESENT THESE PRESSURES AND R THEIR RESULTANT ALSO LET A A2 A3 REPRESENT THE PERPENDICULARS LET FALL UPON THEM SEVERALLY FROM THE CENTRE OF THE AXIS THOSE PERPENDICULARS BEING TAKEN WITH THE POSITIVE SIGNS WHOSE CORRESPONDING PRESSURES TEND TO TURN THE SYSTEM IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE PRESSURE P1 AND THOSE NEGATIVELY WHICH TEND TO TURN IT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ALSO LET X REPRESENT THE PERPENDICULAR DISTANCE OF THE DIRECTION OF THE RESULTANT R FROM THE CENTRE OF THE AXIS THEN SINCE R IS EQUAL AND OPPOSITE TO THE RESISTANCE OF THE AXIS AND THAT THIS RESIST ANCE AND THE PRESSURES PI P2 P3 C ARE PRESSURES IN EQUILIBRIUM WE HAVE BY THE PRINCIPLE OF THE EQUALITY OF MOMENTS PIA  P2A2 P3A3 C R REPRESENTING THEREFORE THE INCLINATIONS OF THE DIRECTIONS OF THE PRESSURES P1 P2 P3 C TO ONE ANOTHER BY

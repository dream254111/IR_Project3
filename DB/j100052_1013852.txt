potential in the United States If we could organize the representatives of the countries of Europe who are in America behind a program for a reconstructed world we should have an instrument for world order whose potentiality can not be measured Instead we hide our heads in the sand and think to make them forget by teaching them English There is no panacea for dealing with the immigrant simpler than that re quired for the whole world And the existing deepseated psychoses can only be cured through a long process of time We must deal as wise physicians with a soulsick people for whose trouble we have no responsibility but who have become an integral part of our lives The spirit and method of American ization must be part and parcel of the solution of the problems of Europe The relations of groups both in con flict and in co6peration is the para mount issue of human society If we can learn even a few of the laws under lying the conflict of groups we shall make rapid progress where we have been blindly groping In the mean time however all these problems will resist solution until there is a just reorganization of Europe Only when the ideals of democracy have removed the possibility of imperialistic exploita tion will there be no longer a need for chauvinism to combat it America can not save herself unless Europe is saved Whether we will or not our immigrants make the worldproblem our problem and the problem pri marily one of psychology Immigration the Matrix of American Democracy By ALLEN T BURNS Director of the Studies in Americanization of the Carnegie Corporation New York City IMMIGRANTS to America for three hundred years have been inher ently the more individualistic of their native fellow countrymen Immigra tion with its inherent difficulties and new experiences has been a process of natural selection sorting out and ap pealing to the more daring enterpris ing selfreliant selfassertive members of any group Immigrants are all alike in possessing the spirit of the pioneer the innovator the explorer the adventurer America the product of immigration has come naturally and inevitably by her most distinguishing characteristics freedom liberty inde pendence Paul Bourget in Outre Mere says Everything in the United States grows clear when understood as an immense act of faith in the social beneficence of individual energy left to itself A friend recently remarked facetiously in connection with the deportation of Emma Goldman and her reported pleasure at being sent to Russia I dont see how being an anarchist she can like any country better than the United States These remarks recall the original constitutional convention with its advocates of as little govern ment as possible Certain exigencies of immigration have always tended to modify this aggressive enterprising individualism The journey was to a strange land unknown difficulties were to be met hostile forces were to be withstood and tremendous obstacles to security and success had to be overcome Rocky and wooded land or an industrial sys tem of steel and strain had to be made 144IMMIGRATION THE MATRIX OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY to yield a living treaties and a modus vivendi with Indian or Tammany braves had to be negotiated education in the religion learning and arts of the elders seemed necessary and protec tion against disease destitution and violators of morals had to be estab lished Individual resources and selfreli ance have never been entirely adequate for these vital necessities of strange people in a strange land There has had to be a pooling of interests and issues a surrender of some personal preferences and peculiar practices This merging of personal opinions and the fusion of individual resources have been the beginnings of collective deci sion and action the origin of American Democracy But this making of common cause has taken place only with one instinc tive purpose and under one imperative necessity This is when individual development and welfare could be bet ter promoted by joint rather than personal action and enterprise Gov ernment has not come into being in its own interest but in the interest of the governed The distinction between European and American Democracy is that the former is slowly centripetal the latter still more slowly centripetal Democracy in Europe has developed by gradually taking from the central authority rights and privileges de manded by the people for themselves In Anlerica the people have grudgingly and little by little surrendered some of their individual prerogatives and power to a central authority But this sur render has been after individual energy left to itself had proved insuf ficient and common decision and action were required for the greater satisfaction of the many whose per sonal welfare was the unique purpose of the establishment of the govern ment as well as of their own or their 11 ancestors immigration and adventure in independence Experience and practice in common decision and action found necessary by selfreliant immigrants have formed the cradle and school of American self government De Tocqueville the first European student of Americas unique experiment said Local assemblies of citizens constitute the strength of free nations Town meet ings are to liberty what primary schools are to science they bring it within the peoples reach they teach men how to use and how to enjoy it In the United States the inhabitants were thrown but as yesterday upon the soil they now occupy    the instinctive love of their country can scarcely exist in their minds but everyone takes as zealous an interest in the affairs of his township his county and of the whole state as though they were his own because everyone in his sphere takes an active part in the govern ment of society Would De Tocqueville visiting Amer ica today observe everyone takes an active part in the government of soci ety To judge by the universal newspaper and personal comment after the last national nominating conven tions he would find himself a very small minority if he made such a statement Otherwise why the backbreaking at tempts to revive the local assemblies of citizens to resuscitate community councils to restore the neighborhood association or social unit But what these champions of the primor dial cell of our body politic have failed to see is that the march of civil ization has rendered impossible this return to the practices of the fathers Town meetings functioned in the be ginning because vital everyday inter ests coincided with the restricted and relatively isolated area occupied by these fellow townsmen Fellowship sustenance security novelty adven ture all had to come within the round 145THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of town life Political institutions were naturally founded on geographi cal divisions because these divisions were foci of the vital interests of citizens Maintaining the political organization was synonymous with maintaining the collective activities necessary for life itself Universal transportation and com munication have broken up the orig inal structure of American political life Interests do not run primarily by locality but by occupation tastes experience education Only such as can make a living by it are sufficiently interested to maintain the old political devices so as to make them have the semblance of working So arises the political machine The lines of polit ical action are so diverse from lines of everyday interests and groupings that the average citizen is inevitably thwarted and baffled in trying to take an effective part in government But new organic groupings are in process investor employer laborer farmer lawyer teacher banker social worker All are trying to influence government through the old machin ery Some day the political structure will be changed to correspond with these new vital and active groupings as closely as the original framework based on territorial divisions coincided with the natural groupings of citizens of those days The voluntary spon taneous selfgoverning associations of those of kindred interests are the pre paratory schools of the coming political life of America In these days of transition and ap parent political paralysis every demo cratic vital organization is as impor tant as the local assembly proved to be for the beginnings of our national life Among these new cradles and schools of the selfgovernment that is to be are those organizations of new immigrants which are as natural and inevitable as those of the earliest set tlers As already suggested the forces producing these collective activities are similar to those that produced the original germ plasm of our democracy The new immigrant feels as isolated as his early prototype Added to the strangeness of the land is the mutual strangeness of himself and the native born On both sides this has made for shrinking from and avoidance of each other Selfassertive as the new comers must be to achieve immigra tion the new immigration has come from peoples with a greater solidarity and cohesiveness than the old Op pression discrimination remoteness from the more individualizing currents of civilization have produced a soli darity and unity which the wilderness gave our forefathers and for which we are again seeking and groping in order to have the makings of a newly effective democracy This isolation and solidarity is coin cident with many emergencies and problems too great for individual solu tion The situation has compelled a new pooling of interests and resources Benefit associations educational clubs synagogues churches nationalistic so cieties and labor organizations are samples of what the problems of new immigrants have generated under as pressing necessity as forced the first colonists to surrender sufficient indi vidualism for constituting a success ful town meeting No understanding of either the immigrant or the forces working for a reconstruction of politics can be adequate without inquiring whether the selfgoverning activities of the new inmmigrants will make a contribution to the new order Many recent experiences with immi grants indicate that in their spontane ous indigenous organizations these new Americans are acquiring the expe rience and selfreliance that made the 146IMMIGRATION THE MATRIX OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY American Revolutionaries insist that all government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed and made De Tocqueville say of the participant in such humble intimate group action He practices the art of government in the small sphere within his reach he accustoms himself to those forms which can alone insure the steady progress of liberty he imbibes their spirit he acquires a taste for order Two years ago a Ukrainian leader came into the writers office and said he was head of a Ukrainian social settle ment with a plant valued at 75000 He and his associates wanted advice as to their future policy and activities He was advised to go for help to the federation of settlements in his city His reply was that his institution had been named social settlement so that it would be understood by native Americans and because that was the name of the American institution most like the one in question These Amer ican institutions had been visited and carefully studied for effective methods But the settlement federation had never asked the Ukrainian settlement to affiliate So the Ukrainians would never seek advice from those who would not accept the Ukrainians as fellow workers and partners in a com mon field On July 4 1919 one hundred and thirty Italian sick and death benefit societies of Chicago held a picnic to get ler to forin a federation They had found the problems of their indi vidual societies so perplexing as to require the pooling of their interests and resources But another reason for the federation was given by the leader of the movement We have noticed that it is very popular among native Americans to conduct health campaigns directed largely at the foreign born The intended beneficiaries are never consulted in the planning or execution of these undertakings Then their origina tors wonder why their efforts fall so far short of their hopes They never realize that the immigrant is so American that he resents and rejects being made a mere recipient and beneficiary of others good works We are hoping that if our societies federate we shall look imposing and impor tant enough to be taken in and made part ners in all that is intended to promote our welfare In Fitchburg Massachusetts is a group of about six thousand Finns They have faced the common prob lems of thickly settled industrial work ers ie wholesome recreation physical exercise education labor organization housing and the high cost of living But by collective effort they have built a social hall where they con duct programs under the direction of fulltime paid musical and dramatic leaders They have erected another large building which has become the labor temple of the whole city Here were held the first classes in English and civics for immigrants at the ex pense of the Finns themselves In the same building is a gymnasium avail able for conmunity use and a coipera tive savings bank with deposits in the hundreds of thousands Outside the city a recreation farm has been purchased for weekend out ings and longer vacations In the city an apartment boarding house and store building has been put up A milk delivery bakery furnishing store and five meat and grocery shops are all operated on a cooperative basis A fixed interest is paid on capital and all profits are distributed in proportion to purchases A leader in these enterprises ex plained how the economic activities came about Most of the men be longed to an agitating revolutionary organization A handful of members proposed starting a co6perative store 147THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY as yielding more immediate benefits than a propaganda for the overturn of society These insurgents were ridi culed and voted down because their proposals if successful would lessen workingmens interest in revolution But like the original weavers of Roch dale the few had the courage of their convictions As they demonstrated their ability to improve their lot by collective concerted action in distrib uting the necessities of life their ridi culers began to take notice and one by one to secure membership in the demo cratic undertakings With this prac tical experience in the profitableness of seeking progress by selfgoverning group decision and action has come a marvelous change These erstwhile revolutionists have become ardent champions of the ballot as the only effective method of governmental prog ress In the place of the mere handful of advocates of democratic action there remains a mere handful of Reds In the little mining town of Avilla in southwestern Pennsylvania made up of Slovaks Poles Lithuanians and Negroes a veritable town meeting was held by the members of an incipient coiperative store A party of malcon tents wanted to throw over the attempt to progress by slow orderly efforts of a united group and to resort to discon tent and agitation This party seemed to be having the better of the argu ment until the cause of gradual per sistent but sure democracy was suc cessfully championed by a West Indian Negro Urging that effective collec tive action was the only sure though slow road to greater welfare and so the only sure cure for discontent he said This coiperative business is like a great ship bound for America from an infected port Of course before you are allowed to land in the wonderful country you must expect to be detained in quarantine a little while until you are thoroughly disinfected And democracy won the day Though the immigrants of today are learning les sons of selfgovernment in much the same way as the earliest immigrants and though America is searching for capacity in selfgovernment the inci dents related suggest that the friction or annihilation of immigrant organ izations might be cutting off ones nose to spite ones face Still the situations described leave something to be de sired Our problems of democracy are too big and inclusive to be solved by separate groups working out solutions by themselves Isolated selfgovern ing activities of immigrants may be as far from producing national effective ness as would have been the separate though selfgoverning activities of the thirteen original colonies How can these democratic propen sities of the immigrant be fused and transmuted into the life of our com munities and nation as a whole Can these beginnings of selfgovernment be merged and blended with the natural counterparts among the native born The town of Hatfield Massachu setts has become the home of large numbers of Poles like other Connecti cut valley villages At first the older residents scorned and resented them then feared the towns utter demorali zation Its traditional unity virtue and civic responsibility were threat ened As in many New England towns the private citizens took part and had influence in their communitys affairs through their church organiza tions These were the organic units of town life There was a Congrega tional Church and a Catholic Church but each appealed equally little to the Pole He consequently was declasse and becoming irresponsible and unde pendable Some Poles also were con cerned and proposed to mobilize Polish interest and responsibility in the way 148BOHEMIANS AND SLOVAKSNOW CZECHOSLOVAKS that Yankees had done the same for the town ie through a church that would appeal to Poles This was undertaken and the native residents joined in and contributed to the proj ect When the Poles had an equally representative and suitable organiza tion for participating in the towns affairs and were made welcome to do so the Poles accepted their part in the communitys business civic social and patriotic activities By discovery of an organization that could be an equal and natural partner with others that functioned for common welfare this town has been saved from the paralysis and deterioration of similar villages where no common unit of solidarity and cooperation has been operating On a larger scale the United States Government found a way of utilizing and so merging the democratic capaci ties of these immigrant associations After the first liberty loan campaign the son of an immigrant went to the Treasury Department and said that the handplucking buttonholing per sonally embarrassing methods were not yielding anything like the possible results among the immigrants He proposed that the thousands of immi grant societies be made agencies of the Liberty Loan Bureau The sugges tion was adopted While the popula tion related to these organizations is at the most 33 per cent of the people of the United States the subsequent Liberty Loan Campaign secured be tween 40 and 50 per cent of their total subscribers through the foreignlan guage division Capacity for responsible collective decision and action is the direst need of the United States Can immigrants again contribute to the generation of this capacity Then in the interest of national unity and welfare this capacity must be appropriated adopted and cherished as the earliest immigrant explorers would have seized the long sought fountain of the renewal of youth Bohemians and SlovaksNow Czechoslovaks By JAROSLAV F SMETANKA Consul Czechoslovak Republic Chicago W AR made many changes in the life of Bohemian and Slovak immigrants in America To start with one hardly knows by what name to call them The race from which they sprang is known as the Czecho slovak race and the land of their fathers is no longer a mere province of the AustroHungarian monarchy but the Czechoslovak Republic This odd looking name has by now become somewhat familiar to readers of Ameri can newspapers but it has not sup planted in this country the names by which immigrants of that race have always been knownthey are still Bohemians or Slovaks The events in Europe have left a deep impression on the state of mind of the foreignspeaking groups here Bohemians and Slovaks even more have acquired a feeling of dignity self confidence and assurance now that they are members of a race which ranks with the independent races of the world Men of Bohemian descent who formerly were almost unconscious of the fact that their roots were in Central Europe came forward in great numbers manifesting an interest in the country from which their parents came and those who were actually raised in what is now the Czechoslovak Republic follow eagerly the course of 149

situation which may be of great usefulness to the schools The character of a college may be that which its alumni determine and any engineering school may be improved by thoughtful suggestions and broadly considered criticisms emanating from its alumni and others who have its best interests at heart Two fundamental propositions must be held elearly in view in all such eriticisms if they are to be of service to the educational administration of the engineering colleges 1 That it is the business of these col leges to train young men into fertile and exact thinkers guided by common sense who have a profound knowledge of natural laws and the means for utilizing natural forees for the advantage of man In other words it is the business of the engineer ing colleges to produce not finished engi neers but young men with a great capactty fo beconng enytneers the goal being ob tained by the graduate only after years of develoNpment in the school of life 2 The problem to be met by the engi neering colleges is more particularly a problem in 710W to properly tratn to the stated purpose The names attached to the subjects taught are not so important as the results produced by the teaching namey the effect impressed on the Stll dents powers This is a teaehers prob lem a question of pedagogy rather than of the engineering profession It must be met with all the direetness and power of the engineers best eforts but it can not be solved as solely relating to the engineer ing profession Much error on this point lies in the minds of many who assume the part of crities of the curricula of the en gineering schools In this connection I may be permitted to point out that proposals set up as ap parently new in the presidential address one year ago by President Steinmets of the American Institute of Electrical En gineers have for many years been largely ineluded within the ideals  of numerous American colleges of engineering It must be admitted that only a few of the engineering schools are living up to their better ideals This is partially due on the one hand to personal or institutional am bitions which foster the sensational or spectacular and thereby inevitably ruin good teaching and on the other hand to the meager support in both encouragement and funds which I have noticed is the lot of the engineering schools attached to many universitties The latter like the former is often the result of personal prej udices or ambitions Most of the faults which are so trench antly and indiseriminately charged to engineering colleges by many engineers should so far as they are real be laid to the pedagogical inexperience and faulty ambitions of the authorities of the many colleges and exeeption should be made of the few of the first rank in which it is safe to say the ideals are high and well cen tered and the administrative organizations hold the ideals continuously in view The query here naturally arises Of what do these ideals properly consist and how fairly shoud they be met by the col lege before its course in electrical engineer ing may be approved as of first rank Eleetrieal engineering demands indus trial engineersmen with an industrial training of the highest type competent to eonceive organize and direct extended in dustrial enterprises of broadly varied char acter For the highest suecess these men must be keen straightforward thinkers vvho see things as they are and are not to be misled by faneies they must have an ex tended and even profound knowledge of712 SCIENCE N S VOL XVIII NO 46 natural laws nore particularly of those relating to energy whieh rest on the law of conservation of energy  an extended knowledge of the useful applieations of these laws and an instinetive capaeity for reasoning straight from eause to effect Moreover they must know men and the affairs of men which is soeiology and they must be acuainted with business methods and the affairs of the busiiless world Briefly to reaeh his highest in fluence eaeh man must eolubine in one a man in the physieal seienees a man in sociology and a man of business All en gineers ean not reaeh this high mark btlt the engineering college eollrse should start eaeh of its students toward that degree of attainment whieh his individual powers will permit Miehael Faraday whose eonserwvatism and intelleetual elearness are proverbial  saici that it requires twenty years to make a man in the physieal seienees The en gineering sehool nust put eaeh student in the way of beeoming so far as his mental and physieal powelqs warrant not only a man in the physieal seienees but a man in soeiology and a man in business as well and this must be done within the narrow limits of four years It is elear that only the foundations of the man may be laid in the preseribed time and the engineering eollege must therefore rigorously hold it self to the fundamentals The engineering eollege faeulty whieh is eontented to deal out soealled information eourses on the narrowly empirieal side of engineering praetiee deals a wrong to tts students whieh they may llot reeognize at the mo ment but whieh will ultilnately tell heavily against their sueeess The students that enter the engineering sehools of the west and I presume likewise of the east are from amongst the most vigorous minds of the high sehools and preparatory sehools and yet it must be aclmitted that they ordinarily possess little povfer of elear thinking power of initiative regard for aeeuraey or understanding of continuous and severe intelleetual effort as these important attributes are under stood in industrial eirees They are not yet mature in body and are less mature in nzind the latter being I think in aceord Rrith the natura order of development   But they eomlrlon7y are well equipped writh physieal vigor and latent mental strength Their preparatory sehooling has given them a defeetive aequaintanee with the eonstruction of the English language an l the spelling of English xvords a still more defeetive aequaintanee with Freneh or Ger man or a fairly good grounding in ele mentary Iatin a smattering of eivies ancl histaory a training in the elenentary prill eiples of arithmetie geometry and algebrsl from whieh the faetor of aeeuraev itl appli eation has often been omittecl and perhaps an enthusiastie interest in the physieaT seienees This enumeration of the attainments of the students entering the engineering eol leges may perhaps be interpreted as refleet ing on the seeondary sehool teaehers but I Tish vigorously to deny the validity of any sueh interpretation I ean truthfully say that eonsidering al of the eonditiotls there is no luore painstaking and right ishing body of people than these teaehers Many of the faults in the preparatory training of our engineering eollege stu dents are eallsed by a doubt whieh is noX apparently agitatinr edueational eireles on aeeount of the question whether the hioh sehools shall be the  people s eolleSes  or

preferred as a preparation for an engineering eollege eourse In my own estimation when ae eompanied with history and a year spent in eivies and natural seienee it is not only to be preferred as a sehool eourse for pre paring the student for college but also a eourse for those numerous students who can not go through eollege laking the students as they eome and nzay be expeeted to eome for the presentf the eleetrieal engineering eourse must in elude the following branehes of learning whieh are preparatory to the more strietly professional studies 1 That fuller training in the eonstrue tion of the English language whieh is requisite to elear thinking and elear wri ting preferably aeeompanied by an addi tional language for added strength 2 The eolateral art of expression in  urawlng 3 Mathematies through an appropriate arnount of ealeulus ineluding the integra tion and solution of equations involving derivatives and instruetion in the use of eoplanar veetors and perhaps quaternion quantities all of whieh should be taught as applied logie with speeial emphasis laid on interpreting the meaning of equations A The seienee of ehemistry soundly taught 5 The seienee of physies soundly taught with partieular emphasis laid on the elementary meehanies 6 Applied meehanies WIeehanies the philosophy of matter foree and energyis the baekbone of the eleetrieal engineers eollege training Instruction in the seienee branehes should be aeeompanied by welleoneeived and properly eondueted laboratory work nwostly of quantitative eharaeter aeeom panying and illustrating the elassroom in struetion and all instruetion whether in natural science mathematies or languages should be under the direetion of men who are engineers or in full sympathy with the aims and ideals of engineering A limited amount of manual training may well aeeompany these studies and likewise if time ean be found for it with out overburdening the reasonable physieal pomTers of the student a limited amount of proper instruetion in surveying ineluding the use of the eompass transit and level will always prove a foree for quiekening the students pereeptions and at the same time put him into possession of proeesses of probable future value In a few of our engineering eolleges whieh rigidly demand the best preparatory work from the high sehools and whieh are at the same time best manned in their faeulties not less than two years are re quirel to cover the ground above deseribed if the work is done in a reasonably satis faetory manner But the above ground cOan nott be eovered with anything like rea sonable sueeess in mueh or any less than three years in the larger number of engi neering sehools that are usually aeeorded high rank After eovering these branehes it seems to be the tendeney in many eol leges to fly of into superfieial or deserip tiare eourses relating to engineering prae tiee during the remaining time of the allotted four years This is espeeially ap parent in those eolleges where the faeulties are ambitious to see their graduates take an Wtedtate plaee of eonsiderable responsi bility in the world This is a fault that destroys mueh of the ultimate advantage whieh the students may derive from their engineering eourse It is a fault also whieh easts just suspieion on engineering edueation alike in eonservative aeademie eireles and in wellinformed industrial  1 elreles A resort to mainly deseriptive eourses of instruetion during the latter portion of the714 SCIENCE kN S Vot XVIII No 466 students life in eollege largely neutralizes the advantage flowing from the instruetion in the fundamentals herefofore deseribed The students are yet to be taught many things relating to engineering life They must learn something regarding the forms and formalities relating to the affairs of business life They must learn the ehar aeteristies and uses of materials their eor reet applieation to the building of aetual struetures the meaning of kinematies and the proeesses of designing and using real naehinery They must also learn to rea son regarding the speeial prineiples of hvdranulies and thermodynamies and the way in whieh they enter into the design eonstruetion and operation of maehines and the manner in whieh they modify the usefulness of maehines and the eeieneies of numerous industrial operations Again they must learn to reason elearly and rationally in regard to the speeife prin eiples relating to applied eleetrieity in euding its widely diverse faetors and the way in whieh these prineiples enter into everyday praetise And they should learn something of the history of the development of engineering and of the lives of its great men for the stirring of proper ambitions The eleetrieal engineering department should be divided into not less than four subdivisions eomprising respeetively Ap plied eleetromagnetism whieh ineludes the prineiples relating to eleetromagnetie ma ehinery and apparatus the theory and praetiee of alternating and variable eur rents whieh inelude the prineiples relating to all those numerous phenomena whieh accompany variable current flow applied eleetroehemistry and eleetrometallurgy and eleetrieal installations whieh ineludes the applieations in engineering praetiee of the numerous prineiples to the design eon struetion operation and testing of eom pete installations and the eomponent parts thereof The teaehing foree of the department should aSord a eompetent expert engineer for the head of eaeh of these subdivisions and sueh additional welltrained foree as tnay be neeessary to adequately earry on elassroom and laboratory instruetion for the partieular numbers of undergraduate and advaneed students whieh attend the eollege The head of sueh a department should spend mueh of his time in super vising the teaehing in elassrooin and labo ratory whieh is performed by his various subordinates But through all of this professional in struetion of the latter part of the eourse it is still prqxcptes prtnctptes prtrwctptes and rational methods of reasoning whieh must be taught if full justiee is done the students until eaeh student beeomes a man of open mind keen observation analytieal thinking and aeeurate powers of inferenee This instruetion should be kept elose to the tenets of good praetise and the senses of the student should be eonstantly stimulated by illustrations and problems drawn from praetiee The drill in reasoning ean un doubtedly be best gained through rational instruetion in the useful applieations of seientifie prineiples and laws and no eriti eism ean be justly passed even by the most eorlservative edueational eireles beeause the graduate is enabled to earn his living as a result of this training but the purely de seriptive should ordinarily be avoided ex eept in a few eases where it has a speeifie funetion in improving the understanding of an applieation of prineiples or is adopteci as a desirable auxiliary to stimu late the sustained interest of the students and thus add vitality to the teaehing In deed exeept for the purposes here defined the introcluetion of the purely deseriptive into the eleetrieal engineering eourse wastes

ehange almost before they ean be put to useful aeeount by the grad uates The students in these eourses frequently gain the impression that the highest type of engineering praetiee is no more than an advanced artisanship and that a graduate from the eleetrieal engineering eourse is the equivalent of a journeyman The most serious injury flows from this through the undesirable narrowing of ideals and ambitions This unfortunate result oeeurs the more readily beeause the popular usage of the word engineer makes it denote either an engine driver a man of purely manual ealling or a man skilled in the prineiples and professional praetiee of  e englneerlng Third are eourses following the ideals whieh I have herein earlier deseribed In eompetent students who enter these eourses are soon diseouraged and drop out Those whose ealling is to artisanship go elsewhere either to a diSerent sehool or direetly to an apprentieeship Those who eomplete the eourse as a rule are eompetent men but they are not likely to enter im mediately into positions of mueh responsi bility but rather to go into the soealled eadet positions or student positions of great industrial enterprises for the pur pose of gaining that experienee in the erafts whieh may enable them to make the most extended use of their training in prineiples Here they gradually  find themselves  and ultimately reaeh the in fluenee in the industrial world for whieh their ealiber and training fit them These men if properly taught have eleaneut ambitions and high ideals as well as the The typieal eourses in eleetrieal engineer ing whieh are today advertised in eollege eatalogues belong to three elasses or eom binations thereof Only the third of these may be aelinowledged to fairly meet the proper ideals in sueh a eourse It is to be remembered that I speak of professional engineering No one possesses a fuller sympathy with the ideals of sehools for training men for the meehanieal trades short of engineering and bordering thereon but these sehools are not eonsidered in my present diseussion First are eourses in whieh predominate the old time instruetion in physies with far more to do with the illustration of the beauties of nature than with the great un derlying natural laws The teaehing of mathematies meehanies and like ground work studies is not ordinarily well super vised in eolleges that maintain sueh eourses in eleetrieal engineering beeause the ad ministrative authorities are out of toueh with the industrial world and mistakXnly put the superfieial and speetaeular in sei enee into the plaee of that sound instruetion only through whieh an engineering eourse may be rightly maintained It is needless to add that the average graduate from eourses of this type is ordinarily of less value in engineering than the average graduate from an oldtime elassieal eourse where at least thoroughness is a require ment and eleetrieal engineering eourses of this type are rapidly disappearing through a merging into one of the following types Seeond are eourses in whieh the ground work studies English mathematies ehem istry physies meehanies are perhaps rea sonably well taught through the earlier

other points of a mixture of granitoid true Dimetian and felsite rocks and in some cases of schists I may further mention with regard to the crystalline schists in Anglesey and in Scotland supposed by the Geological survey also to be of Cam brian and Silurian age that the recent researches of Bonney Callaway Lapworth and myself tend to make it certain that they are all like the similar rocks in America described by Dr Sterry Hunt and others of preCambrian age HENRY HICKS Hendon N W London July 5 1883 Silurian strata near Winnipeg Presuming that it may be of interest to some read ers of SCIENCE to read something on the geology of a locality near Winnipeg I take pleasure in furnish ing information hitherto unpublished concerning an outcrop of Silurian strata in this part of the northwest This interesting exposure occurs a short distance from Selkirk situated some twentyone miles north of Winnipeg on the Canadian Pacific railway and near the Red River At this place a quarry was opened about a year ago which on examination affords many attractions to a student of science Fossils belonging to some sixteen species are readily obtained not only in the 169170 S CIE solid rock but also in the innumerable chippings that lie scattered about the quarry The rock is magnesian limestone dresses readily and when burnt supplies excellent lime Stone from this place is shipped by rail to Winnipeg where it is used for ordinary and ornamental buildingpurposes Many of the fossils being in the form of casts they frequently interfere with the successful dressing of the stone About four feet of drift material overlies the rock but at another quarry lately opened nearer the river and a short distance farthler north the drift material attains a thickness of twenty feet The rock is much the same but apparently not so fossil iferous In the quarry first referred to the remains of cor als belonging to the genera Alveolaria Halysites and Zaphrentis are very numerous Some specimens obtained bear a close resemblance to the genus Favo sites Another group of very common fossils are representatives of the genera Orthoceras Endoceras Ormoceras and Cyrtoceras An excellent specimen measuring eight inches in diameter with three whorls was found The specific characters are much obliterated but in general out line and appearance it bears a close resemblance to Trocholites ammonius of the Trenton Several imperfect specimens of Trilobites were found One appears to be a member of the genus Illaenus Fragmentsof Stromatopora are common showing in all cases distinct lamination and in sev eral welldefined oscula while in a few conical elevations can be observed The specimens obtained were found among the fragments of rock scattered about the quarry but the characters of all are exceed ingly uniform The largest obtained measures 7 inches across 5 in depth and 2 in thickness The laminae are well marked numbering four to the line They present a wavelike appearance there being three crests in the section under examination At the summit of each crest a large aperture is observed Viewing the specimen from the top six of these os cula are seen all about the same distance apart As yet I have discovered no rods or pillars present but there is no question regarding the presence of wellmarked laminae and oscula I have read carefully the description of the species S tuberculata S perforata S granulata S mam millata and S ostiolata of Nicholson and S concen trica of Goldfuss and none seem to embrace the species from this quarry If any reader of SCIENCE can suggest the species to which this interesting fos sil from Selkirk belongs he will confer a great favor upon the writer J HOYES PANTON PreBonneville climate In a critical notice of my preliminary report on Lake Bonneville SCIENCE no 20 Mr Davis points out that a certain conclusion as to the history of the basin is not sustained by the phenomena described Since reading his comment I have not been able to consult my text but if memory serves his restriction is fully warranted Still the conclusion is not of necessity overthrown for it is based in part on omitted data the report aiming to present only an outline of the subject Now that the matter is up for discussion it may be well to indicate these The facts set forth are as follows Above the Bonneville shoreline the topographic forms are those produced by subaerial agencies Below the shore line the details are of subaqueous origin but the NCE VOL II No 27 larger features are subaerial in type Especially are the great alluvial cones constituting the pedi ments of some of the mountains continued beneath the old watermargin their surfaces being lightly etched and embossed by lake agencies Evidently these alluvial cones are of preBonneville date and evideintly too the goal of drainage  the base level of erosion  was lower when they were built than during the Bonneville epoch The questioned conclusion is that the emptiness of the basin during the long preBonneville alluvial cone epoch was due to aridity Mr Davis acutely perceives that the adduced phenomena comport equally well with the alternative hypothesis that the preBonneville condition of the basin was one of free drainage to the ocean the present continuity of the basins rim having been instituted either at or just before the beginning of the Bonneville ep och On this hypothesis the place at which the drainage of the basin was discharged must have acquired the peculiar configuration of a riverchannel and since as our observations show alluvial accumulation has not been great in the region during Bonneville and postBonneville time vestiges of this channel should remain The fact that they have not been found goes far to show that they are not visible for intelligent search has been made for them our eyes having been trained for their recognition by the dis covery of preBonneville channels within the basin All the low passes of the enclosing rimn have been scrutinized At whatever points then earlier drain age systems have intersected this rim the channels appear to have been obliterated by the erosive and constructive agencies of land sculpture Again the principal plain of the Bonneville basin is at heart mountainous Its surface is level only because the alluvial mountain bases are deeply buried by later deposits Of the nature of these deposits we know little more than that the uppermost is lacustrine the Bonneville layer concealing all else The deposit representing the preBonneville or alluvialcone epoch must be relatively heavy and may be assumed to dominate in the determination of the general configuration of the plain With the basin closed a certain system of slopes would arise with the basin open there would arise a certain other system definitely related to the point of dis charge The actual system of slopes is adjusted to the existing status a closed basin with lacustral sedimentation Assuming that there was at some remote date a channel of outflow and that the configuration of the plain was adjusted thereto the period consumed in the obliteration of the one and the remodelling of the other must have been long as compared with the Bonneville epoch The preBonneville portion of the periodwhen the basin was closed but con tainied no lakewas presumably characterized by a climate similar to the present The aridity of the preBonneville epoch is one of the features associating the Bonneville history with glacial history for if it be disproved the Bonneville flooding no longer demonstrates a climatic episode and the apparent homology disappears And the Bonneville oscillations have of course no climato graphic value if they were orographically produced It is well therefore to test thoroughly every link in the chain of evidence G K GILBERT Nevada July 15 1883     I

of the distribution of the fishes is to be seen in the recent history of the Discuboli A short time ago it was supposed all the representatives of this group the Discoboles diskbearers lumpfishes sucking fishes or seasnails as they are variously called were re stricted to the Atlantic and Pacific in their northern parts and to the Arctic Ocean This was previous to 1870 At that date species were known of each of the families of the group From the Atlantic section there were two species of the Cyclopteridme  Cyclopterus lumpus and Eumicrotremus spinosus  and five species of the Liparididse  Liparis mon tagui L liparis L tunicatus Careproctus major and C Reinhardi And from the Pacific the list contained one species of the Cyclopteridse Eumicrotremus orbis two species of the Liparopsidte Cyclopterichthys ventricosus and Liparops stel leri and five species of the Liparididae Liparis mucosus L calliodon L Agassizii L pulchellus and Careproctus gela tinosus Between 1870 and 1891 the additions from the Atlantic were four species of the Liparidide  Careproctus micropus Paraliparis bathybius P liparinus P membranaceus In this period the northern Pacific had yielded one species of the same family Paraliparis rosaceus But the more impor tant additions in this time were from the southern end of the American continent whence came one species of the Liparopsidae Cyclopterichthys amissus and three species of LiparididaeLiparis antarctica L Steineni and L pallidus one or more of which may yet prove to be young of Care proctus Previous to 1891 this was the state of our knowledge of the Discoboles and the generally accepted idea of their distri bution limited them to the farnorth and to the farsouth and displaced them in the tropics by other diskbearers belonging to very distinct families the Gobiidse and the Gobiesocidae As such a number of the Discoboli were deepsea forms and as the anatomy in general was that of types adapted to a life far below the surface in low temperatures there seemed to be no reason for supposing them absent from great depths under the torrid zone These considerations induced me in monographing the group for this museum to predict that eventually the proper distribution would be found to extend from the northern to the most southern localities on the sea bottom Mem Mus Comp Zool XIV No 2 Since 1890 a new genus Cyclopteroides and new species have been added to the number of Discoboles known from the North Pacific They however did not affect the distri bution previously determined It remained for the United States Fishery Commission steamer Albatross under Commander Tanner to supply what was needed to verify the prediction Among the fishes collected by this vessel while dredging off the west coast of Central America in charge of Professor Alexander Agassiz I find representatives of two species which place the subequatorial distribution be yond question These specimens were secured within four degrees of the equator at depths of more than 1700 fathoms in temperatures of about 36 F They are figured and de scribed in the forthcoming report on the fishes of these ex plorations under the names Careproctus longifilis and Para liparis fimbriatus By their capture the Artarctic are con nected with the Arctic localities and the range of the Discoboli is proved to be one of the most extensive among the fishes though the affinities and habits of those we now know are such as indicate that the present list of the species lacks much of being complete NCE 187 But the modifications of our ideas by deepsea exploration as will be shown in a later writing are not confined to a particular group Our conclusions respecting numbers of the families with which we had supposed ourselves well ac quainted have been affected directly through new species and extended ranges and indirectly through peculiarities of ana tomical or other relationships that appear as evidences of the existence of allied forms not yet known and of yet to be discovered centres of distribution serving as sources of re plenishment for the fisheries retreats for recovery from de pletion or as possble new grounds for our fishermen S GARMAx Museum of Comparative Zoology Cambridge Mass Mar 7 NOTES AND NEWS A NEW Jahrbuch der Chemi4 is to be issued by the Ger man publisher H Bechhold Frankfort It will be edited by Pro fessor R Meyer who has secured the cooperation of many eminent men of science The intention is that the progress of pure and applied chemistry shall be recorded every year in a connected series of articles Japan has no fewer than 700 earthquakeobserving stations scattered over the Empire and the Tokio correspondent of the London Times is of opinion that they are all needed He points out that not only are the Japanese shaken up by fully 500 earth quakes every year  some of them more or less destructive  but at intervals there comes a great disaster amounting as in the earthquake of Oct 28 1891 to a national calamity Japanese annals record twentynine such during the last 1200 years The volcano of Kilauea is very active at present The cavity produced by the last breakdown has not filled up but there is an active lake two or three hundred feet below the general level of the floor and a quarter of a mile in diameter Rev S E Bishop of Honolulu says the whole plateau of Halemanman is steadily rising It is evidently being pushed up by lava working under neath and not built up by overflows Professor W D Alexander in charge of the Trigonometrical Survey writes that his assistant Mr Dodge will probably resurvey the crater during the coming summer for the purpose of comparing the present topography with that delineated in Science vol ix p 181 1887 The Vol cano Company is constantly improving the facilities offered to visitors for inspecting the crater It sometimes happens that peat bogs swell and burst giving out a stream of dark mud Herr Klinge as we learn from Nature has made a study of this rare phenomenon Bot Jahrb of which he has found only nine instances in Europe between 1745 and 1883 seven of these being in Ireland Heavy rains generally occur before thephenomenon and detonations and earth vibrations pre cede and accompany it The muddy stream which issues of various fluidity rolls along lumps of peat and moves now more quickly now more slowly After the outbreak the mud quickly hardens and the bog sinks at the place it appeared forming a funnelshaped pool The bogs considered by Herr Klinge have been almost all on high ground not in valleys He rejects the idea that the effects are due to excessive absorption of water by the bog The peat layers which often vary much in consistency have each a certain power of imbibition and the water absorbed does not exceed this limit Excessive rain affects chiefly the upper layer not yet turned into peat and the cover of live vegetation which gets saturated like a sponge after which the water collects in pools and runs off in streams The theory of gas explosions is also rejected and the author considers the real cause to lie in land slips collapses etc of ground under the bog permitting water or liquid mud to enter This breaks up the bog mechanically mixes with it and fluidifles it and an outburst at the surface is the result The limestone formations in Ireland with their large caverns and masses of water are naturally subject to those col lapses which with the vibrations they induce are more frequent in wet years The heavy rains preceding the bog eruptions are thus to be regarded as only an indirect cause of these   J W

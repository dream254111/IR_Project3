construction and maintenance sof roads American roads are far below the average they cer tainly are among the worst in the civilized world and always have beenlargely as a result of permitting local circumstances to de ermine the location with little or no regard for any general sys em and haste and waste and ignorance in building Among the benefits attendant upon the proper construction and maintenance of roadways the speaker mentioned the following Good roads attract population as well as good schools and churches and they improve the value of property so that it is said a farm lying five miles from market connected by a bad road is of less aralue than an equally good farm lying ten miles away from mar ket connected by a good road A larger load can be drawn by one horse over a good road than by two over a bad one Good roads consequently encourage the greater exchange of products and commodities between one section and another besides being sof great value to railroads as feeders As one solution of the road problem ol Pope outlined the fol Oowing plan A commissioner of highways might be provided for in the Agricultural Department with a corps of consulting engi neers and suitabe appropriations made for the prosecution of a general supervising work Under the charge of this commission full systems of maps should be prepared based largely perhaps upon the working of the state and county boards showing more or less completely as circumstances would permit the highways of the country For cooperation with this central bureau and the prosecution tof the work in the most thorough and practical way each State should have its highway commissioner charged with the highest nterests of the State in the way of maintaining its system of roads wunder the most approved methods and for the general public wel fare Then the best practical results could probably be attained zby the division of the State into highway districts consisting of Scounties or perhaps townships each ofwhich should have its everseer in full charge of the opening and construction of new roads in his district and the proper maintenance of all responsible for the expenditure of the regular appropriations for these pur poses These districts could then be Edivided into smaller ones under suboverseers The importance and the value to any country any section and every citizen from the highest to the lowest whether taxpayers or tramps of wellconstructed and properly maintained roads are not easily estimated but clearly are greater than of many affairs which are continually receiving the time and attention of the people in their homes countingrooms public meetings and legislative halls It is a matter to be considered side by side with our splendid and always improving system of public education the assessrnent of our tariff duties or the appropriations regularly made for river and harbor improvements   R A PEtOCTOR MEMORIAL FUND THE English magazine KnowEedZge calis attention to the an nouncement in many of the London papers stating that the mone tary affairs of the late Mr Proctor have now been wound up by his administrator and that the total sum available as provision for his widow and the seven children four of whom are daughters and one a little boy a permanent invalid from hipdisease is un Sder 20so To the small income which this will produce there is to be added Ioo per annum from the Civil List which is how ever granted only during Mrs Proctors life The 2000 above referred to as the value of the residue after the settlement of all debts solne of which were waived has been produced by the sale of Mr Proctors copyrights Mrs Proctor and the eldest daughter have under a satisfactory arrangement with Messrs Longmans retained a small interest in the works nqw in Messrs Longmans hands including the iOld and New As tronomy which will shortly be completed But the value of the nterest retained calculated on the basis of the sum given for the remainder of these copyrights by Messrs Longmans is included in the 20 as is also the money received for all the other copy rights which were purchased on liberal terms either by Messrs Chatto  Windus or by Messrs W H Allen  Co The money given immediately after the death of the late Mr Proctor by the lloyal Literary Fund and the proceeds of five lec tures given byMr W Lant Carpenter as well as gifts from other friends have enabled the family who owing to the suddenness of Mr Proctors death were absolutely without resourcesJ to weather through the first year But these funds have now been exhausted and a committee is in course of formation which the many friends of Mr Proctor are invited to join Subscriptions to the R A Proctor Memorial Fund and communications will be received by Mr E

preparing fluorine has been discovered by M WIoissan This discovery is the outcome of the success which has attended M Moissans efforts to prepare anhydrous fluoride of platinum During the process of his memorable work upon the isolation of fluorine by the electrolysas of hydrofluoric acid contain ing hydrogen potassium fluoride one of the most remarkable phe nomena noticed was the rapidity with which the platinum rod form ing the positive electrode was corroded by the action of the liber ated gaseous fluorine It was surmised that a fluoride of platinum yvas the product of this action but hitherto all efforts to isolate sucb a body have proved unsuccessful In fact for a reason which will be discussed subsequently it is impossible to prepare platinum fluoride in the wet way M Moissan has however as stated in Latvre been enabled to prepare anhydrous platinum fluoride by the action of pure dry fluorine itself upon the metal It was found at the outset that when fluorine is free from admixed vapor of hydrofluoric acid it exerts no action whatever upon platinum even when the latter is in a finely divided state and heated to IooQ C But when the temperature of the metal is raised to between 500 and 600 C combination readily occurs with formation of tetra fluoride of platinum and a small quantity of protofluoride The moment the gas is mixed with a little vapor of hydrofluoric acid the action is immensely accelerated and then occurs readily at ordinary temperatures The same rapid action occurs when plati num i5 placed in llydrofluoric acid saturated withfree fluorine which accounts for the disappearance of the positive terminal dur ing the electrolysis In order to prepare the fluoride of platinum a bundle of wires of the metal is introduced into a thick platinum or fluorspar tube through which a current of fluorine gas from the electrolysis appa ratus is passed On heating the tube to low redness the wires be come rapidly converted to fluoride when they are quickly trans ferred to a dry stoppered bottle If the operation is performed in a platinum tube a large quantity of fused fluoride remains in the tube The tetrafluoride of platinum PtF4 formed upon the wires consists either of fused masses of a deep red color or of small buff colored crystals resembling anhvdrous platinum chloride It is exceedingly hygroscopic With water it behaves in a most curious manner With a small quantity of water it produces a fawn colored solution which almost immediately becomes warm and decomposes with precipitation of hydrated platinic oxide and free hydrofluoric acid If the quantity of water is greater and the temperature low the fawncolored solution may be preserved for a few minutes at the expiration of which or immediately on boiling the solution the fluoride decomposes in the manner above indiSCIENtCE  No 359 420 cated This peculiar behavior with water explains the impossibil ity of preparing the fluoride in the wet way When the anhydrous fluoride is heated to bright redness in a platinum tube closed at one end fluorine at once begins to be evolved as gas and if a crystal of silicon be held at the mouth of the tube it takes fire and burns brilliantly in the gas The resid ual platinum is found on examining the contents of the tube to consist of distinct crystals of the metal Hence by far the most convenient method of preparing fluorine for lecture purposes is to form a considerable quantity of the fluoride first by passing the product of the electrolysis over bundles of platinum wire heated to low redness and afterwards to heat the fluoride thus obtained to full redness in a platinum tube closed at one end It only remains now to discover another method of preparing fluoride of platinum in the dry way to be able to dispense with the expensive electroly sis apparatus altogether M Moissan has also prepared a fluoride of gold in the same manner It is likewise very hygroscopic de composable by water and yields gaseous fluorine on heating to redness MENTAL SCIENCE Diseases of the Memory CASES of amnesia or the loss of a small or large portion of the contents of the mental storehouse have been observed from very ancient times and have always attracted attention The decline of mental powwers brought on by old age is frequently introduced by a failure of memory When however this sets in at an earlier period and develops rapidly and to an extreme degree we recognize an abnormal and striking phenomenon The possibility of such loss particularly when following a purely physical cause such as a blow a fall or other accident could not but suggest the physiological counterpart of the memory process as something very material Today we attempt to analyze such cases more minutely recog nizing in the diseases of memory a natural experiment that throws light upon the laws of mental growth and decay the interrelation of the various avenues of knowledge as well as the nexs of men tal function with anatomical characteristics In all these aspects a recent study of diseases of memory by Dr Korsakoff of Moscow Revue PAzZosophzgue November I889 iS interesting The first case described is that of a Russian writer afflicted with multiple neuritisa nervous disease affecting many groups of fibres as a consequence of alcoholic excess When the patient was first seen the trouble was very marked He had completely forgotten all recent events  he did not even remember whether he had dined or not The conversation just held was at once for gotten and when outsiders insisted that such and such things happened that the patient had forgotten he lightly remarked that he always had a poor memory Very striking is the fact that every thing previous to the onset of the disease he remembers clearly Of a novel that he was writing at the time and had half finished he remembers the first half but does not remember how he intended to finish it Though the domain of his thoughts is limited his reasonings are logical and his judgment sound But a slight inter ruption in the conversation will make him forget what it was about and he will say the same things over and over again using the same stereotyped forms of expression and forgetting that he has said it Moreover under the influence of certain external stimuli certain positions and suggestions he will always make the same remarks in which he draws upon the old storehouse without adding to it There are indications too that to a slight degree the unconscious registration of impressions is going on Thus though he forgets Dr Korsakoff between each visit he always makes the remark regarding it as original each time that the latter is a physician Emotions and feetings make more of an impression than facts and associations A posSmorSem examination in this case showed degeneration of both fibres and cells which had also been inferred from paralysis and other symptoms observed in the patiente Impairment of memory is characteristic of this disease the mem ory for recent events being lost svhile that for events antedating the attack remains and the patient retains judgment and reason ing power The same patient who forgets that he has dined five minutes after leaving the table can play cards or checkers with fair VOL XIV skill anticipating the consequences of his or his adzrersarys playss and following out a plan of attack or defence If the game is slightly disturbed he cannot go on The moment he is through playing he knows nothing of it and will declare he has not playec for a long time The contrast between the past antl the present is sharply brought out in one patient who tells of his travels at great length but repeats the tale a dozen times an hour and always with the same phrases Sometimes the patient does not even recall that he is ill explaining a paralysis as a momentary cramp in the legst and expressing his intention of rising as soon as that has passedO The same patient will cry out under his pain but a moment later will have forgotten the sound and the pain To show how slight an interval is needed for the impression to disappear it may be mentioned that thispatient in reading will read the same line twice having forgotten the one line before setting out upon the next Those who are constantly with such patients soon get to know what they will say upon the usual occasions Their life is monotonous a response to the suggestions from the outside anc not originating from internal impulses Theyare frequentlycon scious of their infirmity and anxious lest they commit some indis cretion   Dr Korsakoff thinks that while the patient does not consciously remember what is going on yet the surrounding events leave some trace by which future conduct is influenced Thus a patient who was undergoing an electric treatment and forgot all about it each time not being able to tell what the doctor was about to do if asked to look about him recognized the apparatus and its purposet which he did not know before his illness Another patient who said  Goodmorning   when the doctor made his first visit of the day did not remember the visit three minutes later but did not then say Goodmorning  The most convincing proof of thisf however appears when recovery sets in and the patient begins toB tell some little of what happened during his illness In one case a sphygmograph was describedan instrument the patient had seen only during his amnesic period Emotional states seem the ones most susceptible of this unconscious perception While the patient forgets his visitors from one time to another yet he meets them with sympathy or antipathy according to previous experiences  or again a patient who was treated with electricity remembered nothing of it but was always put into a bad humor when he savfir the machine In the process of recovery usually quite gradual several inter esting phenomena appear Frequently the patient begins to re member events but in isolation He cannot tell what happenedk just before or just after He cannot tell wAgn things happened as a rule regarding all things as more recent than they really are When he begins to remember new faces and places he still con tinues to repeat the same sayings again and again He will be able to say that he has read a certain thing but does not remember what it contained Thoughnot able to recall the events of his ill ness at will an incident or a suggestion may bring it up Little by little his past is filled out though in a somewhat chaotic manner dreams arld the products of his imagination intermingling with real events without definite relation in time He frequently continues to believe what has no basis in fact His recovery is often a matter of two or three years In another case after five years the memory of the patient continued weak He was able to resume his occupation of correcting sheets for the press but had to keep his finger on the lines so as not to go over the same line twice He even began to practise law though he was compelled to avail him self of all sorts of memoranda and was frequently perplexed by forgetting rhat he had said yet he was able to conduct himself consistently The memory for places streets and houses locali ties in general is restored long before that for time Dr Korsakoff next attempts to analyze just what factor in memt ory is affeeted eoneluding that it is simply the power to reeall im pressions the faets above eited showing that the impression is made though very faintly Moreover as recollection is based upon assoeiation those ideas being most at eommand that have the widest and deepest assoeiative eonneetions the defeet is referred to that portion of the nervous system instrumental in eonneeting nerveeentres with one another Into a more detailed and neees

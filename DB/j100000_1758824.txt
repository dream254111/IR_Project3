DARWIN I H E was a bold discoverer of the wise And lucid order of the world who bade Men love the truth and speak it and be glad When each ideal of superstition dies The bigot cursed him and with flaming eyes Flashed hate upon him as on one gone mad With stark Godenmity although he had No blacker sin than honest hearts devise He was a hero for the right of men To seek beyond their bibles churches creeds Beyond the rigid will of pope or priest Thought buried deep in nature holy when Revealed to us by any soul that reads The infinite mind in God and man and beast II Amid the hard endeavor of old days He strove supremely and with patient will Climbed masterfully onward upward till He rose above mens bitter blame or praise He probed our life along its secret ways Back through historic centuries farther still He traced the simple clear designs which fill Creation as they fill a robins lays Within the vast complexity of forms Births of one primal ancestry he saw Like stars and planets from one chaos hurled And showed through aeons of fire and flood and The march of evolution and of law storms The beauty and the wonder of the world III Ah we could only listen when he told How through the antique ages to the new Life from a barbarous toil and struggle grew Like a staunch creeper from an arid mould How savage instinct in the strong and bold Crushed out the weak and how the mightier few Roamed in their wild bloodthirstiness and slew The fiercefanged slayers that had been kings of old He pictured to our eyes the carnal strife The eternal woe and pathos of the earth And awful brooding death which makes us mute And thus lie spoke the story of our life Thi growth of mind from some tenebrious birth The sOUl of man developed from the brute T7o 19 J883 531 IV Since he has lived our human thoughlt has gained Fresh wings and ampler airs His courage broke The serfdom of tradition and awoke New visions of a freedom unrestrained He was our modern prophet Truth remained As fruit of all the burning words he spoke And seeing with his strong eyes our dreams evoke A future which shall be at last attained He shaped our way and we shall follow Time And hope are with him and with us today And out of sky and sunlight and the dark Shall come a knowledge radiant and sublime And song whose music will not pass away Triumphant as the singing of the lark GEORGE EDGAR MONTGOMERY RECENT EXPLORATIONS IN THE RE GION OF TIIE GULF STREAM OFF THE EASTERN COAST OF THE UNITED STATES BY THE U S FISHCOMAIIS SION 3 Influence of the Gulf Stream THE bottom along the upper part of this slope and the outermost portion of the adjacent plateau in 65 to 150 fathoms and sometimes to 200 fathoms or more is bathed by the waters of the Gulf Stream Consequently the temperature of the bottom water along this belt is decidedly higher than it is along the shallower part of the plateau nearer the shore in 30 to 60 fathoms The Gulf Stream itself is usually limited in depth to about 150 fathoms and often even less in this region below this the temperature steadily decreases to the bottom of the oceanbasin becoming about 3837 in 1000 to 1500 fathoms and falling to 3735 in 1500 to 2500 fathoms We may therefore properly call the upper part of the slope in about 65 to 150 fathoms the warm belt According to our observations the bottom temperature of the warmer part of this belt in 65 to 125 fathoms is usually be tween 47 and 53 F in summer and early autumn Between 150 and 200 fathoms the temperatures though variable are usually high enough to show more or less influence from the Gulf Stream On the warm belt we took numerous kinds of animals that were previ ously known only from the Gulf of Mexico or the Straits of Florida Some belong to tribes that have always been considered as tropical or subtropical such as Dolium Mar ginella and Avicula among the shells In 1 Continued from No 16SCIENCE Voli I No 19 4S1rU 0 31A 40  36 6 7o o 7lo  X SM    9  tfi75 ft7 7 t 777

According to our experience the influence of the Gulf Stream becomes decidedly marked by the rise in tem perature at a few fathoms below the surface  44 I 0 3 80 3 0  43 J 13 0 13 I 3 200 220 240 20 0

o and at 5 10 and 20 fathoms in the same localities The curves of bottom temperatures extend from the shore to near the 800fathom line on the Gulf Stream slope The position of each station is indicated by the total depth placed at the head of the vertical columns 532JTNE 15 1883 SCIE and also at the bottom along a belt corre sponding nearly with the 65fathom line in summer This is shown both by the abun dant occurrence of the various pelagic animals gulfweed etc characteristic of the Gulf Stream water farther south and by the tem peratures taken by us The diagrams of tem perature curves in 5 10 20 30 and 50 fathoms all illustrate this as well as those of the surface and bottom The recent English admiralty charts and others place the inner edge of the Gulf Stream in summer entirely outside the slope or 40 to 50 miles farther from the coast than we have found it in this region In summer as is well known the Gulf  20 4 s o  2o Stream is noticed near a er the coast than in winter but this doubt 7 less applies strictly or 7o chiefly only to the sur  face water But in  summer owing to the heat of the sun there is often very little differ 6 ence between the tem 60 perature of the sur 58 face water at the Gulf s  o0 Stream and on the in shore plateau Our in vestigations show that  the warm belt in 65 to 5 125 fathoms is inhab  ited by a peculiar south 4 0 ern fauna that could not   exist there if thp Gulf Stream did not flow 4 along this area at the 40 bottom both in winter DIAGRAM 4 Temperat and summer It is evi intermediate depths or dent that what many of tions were all made S these species require is between 30 and 50 fath not a very high but a nearly uniform temperature all the year round Such an equable temperature could not exist in this region except under the direct and constant influence of the Gulf Stream On the lower part of the slope in 300 to 780 fathoms we found numerous arctic forms of life corresponding to the lower temperature which at 300 to 500 fathoms is usually 41 to 40 F  and at 500 to 1200 fathoms 40 to 38 F On the inshore plateau which is occupied by a branch of the cold arctic current about 30 miles wide we found that the temperature of the bottom water usually varied from 46 to 42 F in August at the depths of 30 to 60 fathoms In some instances NCE 533 it was higher than this nearer the shore and especially opposite the mouths of the bays and sounds where the tidal flow rapidly mingles the warm surface water 70 to 75 with the bottom water On the cold part of the shore plateau we also found an abundance of arctic species of animals such as are found at similar and less depths north of Cape Cod and in the Bay of Fundy During the colder season of the year the temperature of the water over this plateau is decidedly lower for cod fish even are taken here in large numbers in winter This plateau especially over its shal lower portions has therefore a variable cold 160 500 24o 20 320 360 4o0  46 0 40t9 I

surface climate But the deep water below 300 fath oms has a uniformly cold climate It is evident that the warm belt is here a comparatively narrow zone along the bottom wedged in between the cold waters of the inshore plateau and the still colder waters that cover the outer and deeper part of the Gulf Stream slope The actual breadth of this warm belt varies however according to the steepness of the slope and in consequence of variations in the currents Just south of Marthas Vineyard as will be seen by map I the slope appears to be less rapid than it is either to the east ward or southward and consequently there is here a broader area occupied by the warm belt534 S CI1 especially between the 65 and 150 fathom lines Pirobably this warm belt finally narrows out and disappears from the bottom before reach ing the coast of Nova Scotia We have hitherto obtained no evidence of such a belt off that coast from temperature observations and the character of the fauna therefore it is probable that the cold water of the greater depths there mingles directly with that of the inshore plateau Southward the warm belt continues to the Straits of Florida and beyond the depth of the water characterized by iden tical temperatures gradually increasing as we go south At Cape Hatteras this belt be comes very narrow owing to the abrupt ness of the slope and approaches much nearer to the shore but off the Carolina epasts it spreads out over a wide area which ii iiihabited by a rich fauna similar to that irivestigated by us off Marthas Vineyard Many of the species are already known to be identical In the following summary table are shown the usual range of variation and the approxi mate average temperature at the bottom in the more characteristic zones of depth beyond 20 fathoms in

observations which were abnormally high have been excluded because they were probably erroneous owing to a displacement of the index or some other accident  A singular feature of the serial temperatures taken at many stations is illustrated by diagrams 3 and 4 In twentynine localities out of thirtysix where sufficiently full series of temperatures were taken the temperature was lower at 20 to 30 fathoms than at 50 fath oIms Usually the temperature falls pretty regularly from 5 to 30 fathoms it then rises often three or four degrees and sometimes eight E NCE VOL L No 19 to ten degrees at 50 fathoms falling again at 100 fathoms but the temperature at 100 fathoms was often higher than at 30 fathoms In some cases as shown in diagram 4 the temperature was lower 45 F at 30 fathoms than even at the bottom in 200 to 250 fathoms There is often therefore a stratum of colder water 20 to 40 fathoms beneath the surface overlying the warmer Gulf Stream water situ ated between 50 and 100 fathoms below the surface in this region This stratum of cold water may be a lateral extension of the cold water of the inshore plateau situated at simi lar depths Perhaps the greater density of the Gulf Stream water due to evaporation may so nearly balance the increase in density due to lower temperature as to make this a phenomenon of constant occurrence at these depths It happened not infrequently that the sur face temperature early in the morning when we usually began dredging was one or two degrees lower than that at 5 fathoms but dur ing the middle of the day the surface water was generally slightly warmer than that at 5 fathoms These changes are illustrated by some of the lines on diagrams 3 and 4  To be continued TRANSFERRED IMPRESSIONS AND VISUAL EXALTATION THERE has recently appeared in the Fort nightly review an article by Messrs Edmund Gurney and F W M Myers regarding the subject of what is popularly known as clair voyance By these authors it is termed  transferred impression The gentlemen in question working under the auspices of the Society for physical research have as they claim collected an enormous amount of evi dence all tending to prove that the mind can under certain conditions receive impressions through other agencies than the senses The mental conditions under which this power is developed are generally abnormal either as regards the Percipient or the person per ceived who is called the Agent The cases are classified in accordance with this condition I append here a specimen of the stories which these gentlemen attest as true A mesmerist well known to us was re quested by a lady to mesmerize her in order to enable her to visit in spirit certain places of which he himself had no knowledge He failed to produce this effect but found that he could lead her to describe places uLnknown to her but familiar to him Thus on one

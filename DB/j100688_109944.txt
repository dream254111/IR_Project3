the Deviation from Newtons Scale in the Tints which many of them develope on Exposure to a Polarized Ray By J F W Herschel Esq FRS Lond and Edin Read December 23 1819 Phil Trans 1820 p 45 When Malus published his discovery of the polarization of light the list of doublyrefracting crystals was small and as the most re markable of them possessed only one axis of double refraction it was presumed that the law discovered by Huyghens applicable to that one might hold good in all but the discovery of crystals with two axes of double refraction has proved the fallacy of such generali zation and rendered new and extensive investigations necessary There are two modes of conducting observations on double re fraction and polarization the one turns upon immediate observation of the angular deviation of the extraordinary pencil the other de pends upon the separation of a polarized ray into complementary portions by the action of a crystallized lamina After noticing the advantages of the latter Mr H observes that to render observations on the tints developed by polarized light available they must be comparable to each other hence the importance of discovering the existence and tracing the laws of those causes which operate to dis turb their regularity In the authors first inquiries on the polari zation of light he was struck by the great deviation from the suc cession of colours in their laminwe as observed by Newton which many crystals exhibit when cut into plates perpendicular to one of their axes and finding this phenomenon unconnected with irregu larities in their thickness or polish and uniformly repeated in diffe rent and perfect specimens he was led to inquire into their causes especially as they appeared to form an unanswerable objection to M Biots theory which perfectly explains the tints in crystals with one axis In the several sections of this communication Mr H first enters into a detailed description of tlhe phenomena themselves which are reducible to one general fact namely that the axes of double re fraction differ in their position in the same crystal for the different coloured rays of the spectrum being dispersed in one plane over an angle more or less considerable according to the nature of the sub stance In many bodies the magnitude of this dispersion of the axes is comparatively trifling while in some not otherwise remark able for a high ordinary or extraordinary dispersive power it is enor mous and renders all computation of the tints in which it is not taken into consideration completely erroneous A new element is thus developed which for the future must enter into all rigorous formulae of double refraction and another striking instance is pre sented of the inherent distinction between the different coloured molecules of light At the same time says the author by the com plete explanation this principle affords of all the more perplexing123 anomalies in the tints the theory of oscillations stands relieved of every difficulty and may be received as adequate to the representa tion of all the phenomena of the polarized rings and entitled to rank with the fits of easy transmission and reflection as a general and sim ple physical law A Case of the Human Foetus found in the Ovarium of the Size it usually acquires at the End of the Fourth Month By A B Gran ville MD FRS In a Letter addressed to Sir Everard Home Bart VPRS Read Jainuary 13 1820 Phil Trans 1820 p 101 The body of which the dissection is described in this paper ex hibited a considerable tumour placed immediately above the region of the pubis Upon opening the abdomen a quantity of fluid re sembling blood was found in its cavity and a tumour four times the size of a hens egg obstructed the view of the internal parts of gene ration resting upon the left portion of the anterior surface of the uterus a bloodvessel which proved to be a branch of the left sper matic artery and of the size of a large crowquill penetrated the dense portion of this tumour and a smaller vessel communicated with the spermatic vein The inferior portion of the tumour presented diaphanous membranes through which was seen a fcetus of about four months growth The fact of an extrauterine conception being thus made out the author proceeded to examine the connection of the tumour with the neighbouring parts and the condition of the uterus whence it ap pears that the tumour was seated in the left ovarium which had burst in three places so as to suffer the membranous sac containing the fcetus to protrude into the cavity of the abdomen and that by the growth of the fretus that part of the covering of the ovarium was ultimately lacerated which involved the placenta by which the ad hesions of the latter were torn producing the sudden and fatal haemorrhage which killed the patient and filled the abdomen with blood The uterus had acquired considerable development during the pe riod of ovariogestation the right ovary was healthy as also its Fallopian tube The left Fallopian tube was sound and loose and its fimbriated extremity had no connexion with the neighbouring tumour Many other circumstances relating to the history of this case and to the anatomical structure exhibited by the disputed parts are con tained in an explanation of Mr Bauers drawings which illustrate and accompany the paper

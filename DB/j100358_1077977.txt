O RUGG UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THE OUTSTANDING CHARACTERISTIC OF EDUCATION AS IT HAS DEVELOPED IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS IS FOUND TO BE A GENERAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE QUANTITATIVE METHOD BY SCHOOL MEN AS EDUCATION HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE A SCIENTIFIC PROFESSION IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE SCHOOL MAN IS DETERMINED MOST LARGELY BY THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE KEEPS IN TOUCH WITH THE QUANTITATIVE TOOLS TO THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR AND TEACHER THE MOST NECESSARY TOOLS OF THE DAY ASIDE FROM CLASSROOM AND SCHOOL EXPERIENCE ARE ACQUIRED BY KEEPING UP TO DATE WITH THE QUANTITATIVE LITERATURE IN EDUCATION THIS QUANTITATIVE LITERATURE IS MULTIPLYING MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE TEACHER OR SUPERINTENDENT INTERESTED IN THE GENERAL FIELD OF EDUCATION CAN HOPE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH IT WE RECOGNIZE CLEARLY TODAY THAT WE MUST SELECT OUR FIELD OF INTEREST AND WE FIND THAT EVEN WHEN DOING SO IT REQUIRES UNUSUAL EFFORTS TO KEEP ACQUAINTED WITH WHAT IS COMING OUT IN SCHOOL REPORT MAGAZINE MONO GRAPH AND BOOK AGENCIES WHICH ARE EQUIPPED TO ACQUAINT THE SCHOOL MAN WITH THIS RAP IDLY MULTIPLYING LITERATURE MUST TAKE UPON THEMSELVES MORE AND MORE ACTIVELY THE CARRYING OUT OF THIS FUNCTION IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE FOLLOWING DIS CUSSIONS TO PUT INTO THE HANDS OF SCHOOL PEOPLE A SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH THE QUANTITATIVE LITERATURE OF THE DAY IT MAY BE SAID AT THIS POINT THAT THE REVIEW EDITORS OF THESE JOURNALS WILL ATTEMPT TO KEEP THIS PAR TICULAR DEVICE UP TO DATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND THUS PLACE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE SCHOOL MAN AN EVERREADY TOOL TO HELP HIM IN STAYING ABREAST OF THE TIMES A THE NECESSITY FOR WELLSELECTED BIBLIO GRAPHIC MATERIAL THE STUDENT WHO WISHES TO ATTACK THE SOLUTION OF ANY NEW PROBLEM IN EDUCATION FACES FIRST THE TASK OF MASTERING

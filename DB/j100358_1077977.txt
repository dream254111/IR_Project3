O RUGG University of Chicago The outstanding characteristic of education as it has developed in the last fifteen years is found to be a general acceptance of the quantitative method by school men As education has become more and more a scientific profession it has been recognized that the success of the school man is determined most largely by the degree to which he keeps in touch with the quantitative tools To the school administrator and teacher the most necessary tools of the day aside from classroom and school experience are acquired by keeping up to date with the quantitative literature in education This quantitative literature is multiplying more rapidly than the teacher or superintendent interested in the general field of education can hope to keep in touch with it We recognize clearly today that we must select our field of interest and we find that even when doing so it requires unusual efforts to keep acquainted with what is coming out in school report magazine mono graph and book Agencies which are equipped to acquaint the school man with this rap idly multiplying literature must take upon themselves more and more actively the carrying out of this function It is the purpose of the following dis cussions to put into the hands of school people a systematic method of keeping in touch with the quantitative literature of the day It may be said at this point that the review editors of these journals will attempt to keep this par ticular device up to date from year to year and thus place at the disposal of the school man an everready tool to help him in staying abreast of the times A THE NECESSITY FOR WELLSELECTED BIBLIO GRAPHIC MATERIAL The student who wishes to attack the solution of any new problem in education faces first the task of mastering what has been done by others in the same field His first need is that of a wellselected bibliography in his particu lar field Most bibliographies covering the general field of education or even of its more important subdivisions contain material which has not in all cases been properly evaluated The student wishes to know out of the hundreds of studies which have been made in his field which ones will be most helpful 753754 THE SCHOOL REVIEW to him in starting upon his problem One of the characteristics of the recent movement in education is that school men have more and more turned to this task of making systematic evaluations of bibliographic material and have reported these in connection with their books or original studies in the particu lar fields The tendency recently has been to give the reader a selected and evaluated bibliography We therefore print first in this review a list of books each of which gives the reader for the field in question a wellannotated and clearly organized bibliography A LIST OF TEXTBOOKS ON EDUCATION EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHIC MATERIAL I SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION A General Field 1 CUBBERLEY E P Public School Administration

turn for bibliographic material the school man also needs to be in touch with the permanently established agencies which are constantly issuing quantitative literature For those administrative officers and school teachers who have not already at hand a list of these sources we enumerate the most important of them next In each case bureaus or other types of educational agencies have been included if it seems likely that the school man by keeping in touch with them will be able to secure from time to time material of a sort helpful to his school practice The idea underlying this next phase of our review is that there are certain more important bureaus foundations departments etc which are continually investigating scientifically specific aspects of school practice and which are reporting the results to workers interested in the various problems The list follows I BUREAUS AND FOUNDATIONS OF NATIONAL SCOPE I US Bureau of Education Washington DC Four types of publications a An nual Report of the Commissioner of Education comprises two volumes Vol I is made up of descriptive reports on current movements in education recent educa tional experiments and innovations descriptive

Statistics are for all phases of finance revenues and expenditures unit costs etc attendance statistics and statistics on the teaching staff b Bulletins of the Bureau of Education Each year the Bureau publishes approximately fifty bulletins written by collaborating specialists of the Bureau on particular problems of education In the past some most important contributions to educa tional administration have been made through these bulletins Lists can be found in the back cover of each bulletin Under war conditions charges are made for each of these bulletins to those who are not on

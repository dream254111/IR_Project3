Muelleriidae retained among the Dimyaria The Monomyaria seemed to me however to be a natural  genetic  group and the Muelleriidae were bimusculose in youth and their monomyarian characteristics in the adult appeared to be a peculiar teleological adaptation I am still disposed to believe that the Monomyaria con stitute a natural group although Mr Dall has good reasons for thinking that in fact there does not at present seem to be any good basis for ordinal divis ions in the Lipocephala What Mr Dall designates as the remarkable characters of the group of Met arrhiptae seemed to me to furnish as good a basis for an  order  as any of those that have been used for that purpose consequently I gave the name as an ordinal designation in 1871 But the question whether certain groups are of ordinal or minor value is of less moment than the natural subdivision of the class If the myological peculiarities are not the best criteria what are A view that has had some currency that the Mo nomyaria are inferior forms of Acephala is negatived by both embryological and paleontological evidence The testimony of both is conclusive that the Mono myaria are derivatives from Dimyaria Is it certain that the shell of the Polyplacophora Chitons is the exact homologue of the shells of the typical Gastropods  I am acquainted with what has beein published of the embryology of the group but am left in doubt both as to facts and interpretations At any rate it is certain that the old views of a close relation between the Polyplacophora and the doco glossate Gastropoda had very little morphological basis My gratitude for the excellent article of Professor Lankester impels me tocordially indorse the encomi ums of Mr Dall while I concur with the critic as to the family arrangement Professor Lankester has sometimes been misled too by not remembering that the same objects may be called by different names for instance he has referred to the  Rachiglossa I1  or 1 a gastro pod named Pyrula Lam fig 38 but the figure represents a type belonging to the  Tenioglossa 3 1 3 and repeated thereunder as one of the family 4 Doliide under the name Ficula As my eyes light on neighboring names I may add that the Pediculariidae and  Ovuhlm do not fulfil the conditions of the Siphonochlamnyda 4 shell always spiral they do not have true spires Professor Lankester has been deceived by false guides Such lapses are however of a kind inevi table in a general work for it is impossible for one man to verify every statement TIiEO GILL A fasting pig IN a recent flood June 26 that visited this neigh borhood Mr John Aughenbaugh of West Manchester township had five hogs carried away by the water On Aug 7 one of them was found under a large heap of driftwood about a mile from the home of Mr Aughenbaugh The animal had been securely imprisoned by the timber and had not eaten any thing for fortytwo days Although very consid erably emaciated when released from its prison it appeared to have no trouble in emptying a crock of thick milk that was offered it It has since been doing well and no doubt will soon recover all it lost in flesh E F S York Penn 335 A WIDER USE FOR THE LIBRARIES OF SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES To those who are obliged to use the libraries of our smaller colleges it is often a source of vexation to find that the books one is referred to are wanting The resources of the colleges are limited and the amount of money which can be expended for the purchase of new books small and that small amount often devoted according to the wishes of the donor to the class of books least needed A case in point occurred lately where a college professor of mathematics was asked to write a short account of the life of Todhunter and he felt obliged to say that he would be glad to undertake the article but could not before he had visited the libraries of either New York or Boston which he hoped to be able to do during his next vacation This constant lacking of just the books one needs for his work is most hampering It is not the Century or the Harper or the latest novel or the new book of travel which cannot be had these find their way into all the odd corners but it is the specialists books a volume of the transactions of some learned society a scientific journal or the modern treatises on thermodynamics on electricity or on biology which are needed anid which can be found only in a very few of our libraries in the necessary profusion A few such libraries have now been collected by our older scientific societies and our larger colleges The books of the college libraries are for a specific purpose and find abundant use at the hands of the students and professors With the societies the matter stands differently It cannot be denied that one of the original objects of the establishment of these societies was that by the publication of their own  proceedings they might by exchange gather a collection of books which could not in the then comparatively poor state of the country be gathered in any other way and which were to be for the use of the members and such favored friends as they might designate It has so happened that these societies were established by the small knots of scientific OCTOBER 3 1884

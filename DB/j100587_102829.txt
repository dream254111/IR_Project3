A LETTER FROM MR JOHN LUFFKIN TO THE PUBLISHER CONCERNING SOME LARGE  LATELY FOUND IN A GRAVELPIT  COLCHESTER S I R READING THE PH TRANSACTION FOR JULY LAST NO 271 I FIND AN ACCOUNT OF SOME STRANGE BONES FOUND IN THE GROUNDS OF MR SOMNER IN CHARTHAM NEAR CANTERBURY IN KENT C WHICH GIVES ME OCCASION TO INSINUATE TO YOU THE LIKEWISE FINDING THIS SUMMER ATWRABNESSA SMALLVILLAGE SITU ATE IN THE MOST EASTERN PARTS OF ESSEX UPON THE RIVER  NEAR HARWICH DIVERSE BONES OF AN EXTRAORDINARY BIGNESS WHICH WERE FOUND AT  OR SIXTEEN FOOT BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN DIGGING FOR GRAVEL TO MEND THE ROADS WITH C THE LARGEST AUD MOST REMARKABLE OF WHICH WAS PROCURED AND SENT TO ME BY THE LEARNED AND INGENIOUS MR RICH MINISTER OF THE PLACE WE READ IN CAMDEN PAG351 THAT IN THE TIME OF KING RICHARD II AND IN THE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZ THERE WERE FOUND IN THE MOST EASTERN PROMONTORY OF ESSEX AT A PLACE CALLED C DULFINESS WHICH I TAKE TO BE WALTON LARGE TEETH AND BONES OF AN EXTRAORDINARY BULK WHICH WERE ESTEEMED THE BONES OF GIANTS BUT MR CHILDREY IN HIS BRITANNIA BACONICA PAG 100 RATHER THINKS THEM TO BE THE BONES AND TEETH OF SOME ELEPHANT BURYED THERE BY THEIR LOVING MASTERS THE ROMANS THAT THESE WERE THE BONES AND TEETH OF SOME ELEPHANT I AM PRONE TO BELIEVE FIRST BECAUSE THEY FAR SURPASS IN MAGNITUDE THE BONES C OF THE LARGEST CREATURES THAT WE HAVE AT THIS DAY IN OUR ISLAND SECONDLY BECAUSE TIS EVIDENT FROM DIO CASSIUS AS QUO TED BY MR CAMDEN SEE THE ROMANS INBRITAIN AND IN HIS BRI925 BRITANNIA PAG 347 THAT ABUNDANCE OF ELEPHANTS WERE BROUGHT OVER INTO ENGLAND BY THE EMPEROR CLAUDIUS IN HIS WARS WITH THE BRITAINS YEA INTO ESSEX ITSELF AS AP PEARS FROM THE SAME DIO A LITTLE AFTER IN THESE WORDS CLAUDIUS HAVING AT LAST JOYNED PLAUTIUS AND TOOK THE COM MAND OF THE ARMY PASSED THE RIVER MEANING THE THAMES AND UPON A FAIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ENEMY WHO WERE POSTED THERE TO RECEIVE HIM OBTAINED THE VICTORY TOOK CAMOLODUNUM C THIRDLY IN COMPARING THIS BONE WITH THE OSTEOLOGY OF DR MULLINS IN HIS ANATOMICAL ACCOUNT OF THE ELEPHANT BURNT AT DUBLIN C I FIND IT PERFECTLY TO AGREE TO AND WITH THE OS HUMERI THEREOF NOT ONLY TO OUTWARD APPEAR ANCE OR FORM BUT TO MEASURE ALSO FROM WHICH CIRCUM STANCES WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT THESE WERE THE BONES C OF SOME ELEPHANT RATHER THAN OF ANY OTHER ANIMAL AND IT DOES SEEMINGLY APPEAR TO METHAT THESETEETH AND BONES MENTIOND BY MR SOMNERMIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TEETH AND BONES OF SOME ELEPHANT RATHER THAN OF THE HIPPOPOTA MUS AND THAT FIRST IN RESPECT OF THE PLACE FOR AS MR CAMDEN SAYS IN HIS BRITANNIA PAG 197 SPEAKING OF CHILHAM IN KENT OF WHICH THIS CHARTHAM IS A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE SITUATE IN THE SAME DOWN AND ON THE SAME RIVER STOWR THAT IT IS A CURRENT REPORT AMONGST THE INHABITANTS THAT JULIUS CAE SAR ENCAMPT THERE IN HIS SECOND EXPEDITION AGAINST THE BRITAINS AND THENCE IT WAS CALLED JULHAM AS IF ONE SHOULD SAY JULIUS STATION OR HOUSE IT APPEARS FURTHER BRITAN P 208 THAT RHATUPIAE WHICH WHETHER RICHBOROUGH OR STONER MATTERS NOT SITUATE NEAR THE PRESENT SANDWICH WAS THE PLACE OF CLAUDIUS HIS LAND ING IN BRITAIN AND THAT THROUGH THIS DOWN WAS HIS NEAR EST PASSAGE TO THE THAMES IS INDISPUTABLE WHITHER HE WAS GOING SO THAT TIS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT DURING THE STAY PASSING OR REPASSING OF THESE ROMAN ARMIES THROUGH THESE DOWNS SOME ONE OF THEIR ELEPHANTS MIGHT PERISH OR DYE AND BE BURIED THERE SE926 SECONDLY BY THE TEETH THEMSELVES FOR IF YOU COMPARE THE ICONS GIVEN BY MR SOMNER WITH THE DESCRIPTIONS OF DR MULLINS IN THE AFORESAID ANATOMY P 40 YOU WILL FIND THEM THE VERY SAME AS TO BREADTH AND DEPTH C AND THEIR BEING MOLARES FOR SAYS THE DR THESE EIGHT WHICH WERE ALL THE ELEPHANT HAD BESIDES THE TWO TUSHES WERE MOLARES FOR HE HAD NO INCISORES THIRDLY AND LASTLY TO SOLVE THAT GREAT DIFFICULTY WHICH OBLIGED THIS GENTLEMAN TO IMAGINE THIS DOWN TO HAVE BEEN AN AESTUARYTHAT HIS HIPPOPOTAMUS MIGHT THEREIN DIG ITS SELF A GRAVE OTHERWISE HOW SHOULD THESE BONES BE FOUND AT SUCH A DEPTH FOR WHO WITH REASON SAYS MR SOMNER CAN IMAGINE THAT ANY LAND CREATURE COULD EVER HAVE HAD AT FIRST SO DEEP A BURIAL THIS INDEED WOULD HAVE BEEN AN HERCULEAN LABOUR BUT TIS EASILY EXPLAINED WHY THESE BONES SHOULD AT THIS DAY BE FOUND AT SUCH DEPTHS IF WE CONSIDER THE ALTERATION OR RISING OF THE VALLEYS BY THE CONTINUAL WASHING DOWN OF THE LOOSE EARTH OR SOYL BY THE RAINS AND SNOWS FROM THE ADJACENT HILLS AND BY THE ANNUAL ROLLINGS OF THE GRASSSEDGE C GROWING UPON IT FOR PROOF OF WHICH TAKE THE FOL LOWING INSTANCE FROM DR PLOTIS NAT HIST OF STAFFORDSHIRE CHAP VI P 48 P 220 SPEAKING OF A MOSS C WHEREIN THERE WAS FOUND A LUMP OF COYNS OF EDWARD IV OF EN GLAND SUPPOSED TO BE LOST IN A PURSE OR CLOATH NOW ROT TED AWAY AT 18 FOOT DEEP WHICH BEING ABOUT 200 YEARS SINCE THAT IS WHEN THEY WERE FOUND WHOEVER PLEASES TO COMPUTE IT WILL FIND THIS MOSS GREW ABOUT ONE FOOT IN 11 YEARS OR ONE INCH PER ANNUM AND  PROXIME DIVERSE OTHER INSTANCES OF ALTERATION ARE MENTIONED IN THE SAME HISTORY AS IN CHAP 3 PAR 11 12 AND CH6 PAR 45 46 47 48 C NOW IT WILL BE EASILY GRANTED THAT IF THIS MOSS GREW OR ADVANCED ITSELF ABOVE ITS FORMER SURFACE 18 FOOT IN 200 YEARS THEN THIS VALE OR DOWN MIGHT ADVANCE ITSELF 17 FOOT IN ALMOST 1700 YEARS COLCHESTER SEPT 15 1701 II A

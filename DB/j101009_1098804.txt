should be addressed to the EDITOR at University Station Charlottesville Va BUSINESS communications to the PUB LISHERS THE chair in the Law Department of Washington and Lee Univer sity made vacant by the resignation of Professor Charles A Graves to accept a chair in the Law Department of the University of Vir ginia has been filled by the election of Professor William L Clark of the Catholic University of Washington Professor Clark has an enviable reputation as a law writer and will prove a valuable acquisi tion to the cause of legal education in Virginia We congratulate Washington and Lee upon so excellent a choice and extend to Pro fessor Clark a hearty welcome back to old Virginia and his native heath THE infamous case of Lord Audley 3 How St Tr 402 has re cently been paralleled in Louisiana where a husband was indicted for a rape upon his wife The proof was that he held the wife by the throat while another committed the act of sexual intercourse with her On a previous trial of the actual perpetrator of the crime he was ac quitted Upon the subsequent trial of the husband he was found guilty under the Louisiana statute declaring principals in the second degree indictable and punishable as those in the first degree On ap peal the appellate court held that a husband cannot himself commit the crime of rape upon the person of his wife that he may be a prin cipal in the second degree where he assists another in perpetrating the crime but that the principal in the second degree cannot be convicted where the alleged principal in the first degree has been acquitted Hence the court ruled the accused husband could not be convicted and the scoundrel went unwhipt of justice under the shield of this tech nicality The case is HIines v State 25 South 372 THE opinion of the Supreme Court of Georgia in the recent case of Johnstone v Taliaferro 32 S E 931 contains an interesting and valu able discussion of the question whether in a limitation to a female forVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER life remainder to her children the word children will include bastardswhere the lifetenant had no children legitimate or illegiti mate at the date of the deed and where the statute of the State similar in this respect to the Virginia statute renders bastards capa ble of inheriting and of transmitting inheritance on the part of the mother In the absence of statutory enactments it is well settled that bas tards are not included in the word children unless there are no other children but bastards at the date of the deed or will and no reasonable probability of any or it is plain from the instrument itself that the donors intention was otherwisethe maxim of the common law being qui ex damnato coitu nascuntur inter liberos non compu tentur See 1 Minors Inst 4th ed 447 and cases cited In Virginia our court has recognized this rule but has held that the effect of our statute declaring that bastards shall be capable of in heriting and transmitting inheritance on the part of their mother as if lawfully begotten  Va Code sec 2552 is to alter the common law rule as to the construction of the word  children and to entitle bas tards to claim under that description in all cases where the parentage is referred to the mother or as Professor Minor expresses it 1 Minors Inst 450 he is to be counted amongst the children of his mother and as a consequence will take by virtue of a devise or gift to his mothers children just as if he were legitimate See Bennett v Toler 15 Gratt 588 The Supreme Court of Georgia in the case above referred to reaches the opposite conclusion and seems to be supported by an almost un broken line of authorities The court cites and comments upon numerous authorities from the various States where similar statutes exist The Virginia case of Bennett v Toler is distinguished on the ground that in that case the bastard was in being at the date of the will and was known and recognized by the testator as his daughters son The reasoning of Allen P in that case leading to the conclu sion that even had the bastard not been born at the date of the will the result would have been the same is disapproved IN many of the States while there is a fixed legal rate of interest there is also a conventional rate greater than the legal rate when fixed by express contract of parties and it is probably the better doctrine that the contract will continue to bear the extraordinary rate after 112 Junematurity Cecil v Hicks 29 Gratt 6 Cromwell v County of Sac 96 U S 51 and ca ci If the agreed rate is greater than the ordinary legal rate this doc trine seems to be perfectly just since the debtor has the power to pay the debt at maturity according to his promise and thus avoid the fur ther payment of interest If he does not so pay it is but fair to as sume that he prefers to keep the money and pay the greater rate agreed upon originally But where the agreed rate is less than the legal rate and the debtor retains the creditors money against the will of the latter a wholly different principle ought to apply for here the creditor having agreed to lend his money at the lesser rate only until the ma turity of the debt he ought not to be compelled to accept the lesser rate after maturity if the debtor does not then pay and refuses to pay he ought to be compelled to pay the legal rate in the future otherwise he is encouraged not to pay and receives a reward for his delinquency That the creditor is willing to accept a less rate for the agreed time of the loan e g on call raises no presumption that the parties intended the lesser rate to continue after maturity of the debt and after the creditor has demanded the return of the money In the former casewhere the agreed rate is greater than the legal ratethe debtor may reasonably be presumed to claim under the contract be cause he has chosen to retain the money after maturity But in the other case claiming against the will of the creditor and therefore against the contract he ought to be required to pay the legal damages and the legal measure of damages for nonpayment of money is the legal rate of interest In both cases the burden should be on the de linquent debtor Where the agreed rate is greater than the legal rate the burden is put upon him by compelling him to pay the extraordinary rate where the agreed rate is less than the legal rate the burden should likewise be put upon him by compelling him to pay the legal rate If the loan were made without interest certainly the creditor would be entitled to the legal rate of interest after maturity The same rule should apply where the creditor has by contract relin quished not all but a part of the legal rate of interest Authorities requiring the debtor to continue to pay the extraordinary rate are abundant but no case has been found expressly deciding what rule should be applied where the agreed rate is less than the legal rate See cases collected in note to OBrien v Young N Y 47 Am Rep 74 1899 113 EDITORIALVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER WHILE it is well settled that the assignee of a chose in action takes subject to all the equities of the debtor against the assignor existing at the time of the assignmentin other words stands in the shoes of his assignoryet if he purchases in good faith he does not take subject to the equities of third persons who are not parties to the transaction and of whose equities he has no notice Thus where a guardian hold ing a bond payable to him as guardian assigned it to one of his wards upon her attaining her majority in payment of the balance in his hands belonging to her the title of the assignee thereto was held not to be affected by the fact subsequently disclosed that another ward owned onehalf interest in the bondtLe assignee having taken without notice of such interest Hunter v Lawrence 11 Gratt 111 See also Broadtts v Rosson 3 Leigh 12 Moore v Holcomb 3 Leigh 597 Jlott v Clark 9 Pa St 399 49 Am Dec 566 and note It is important to observe that under the Virginia statute giving the assignee the right to maintain in his own name any action which his assignor might have maintained Va Code sec 2860 the assignee cannot maintain the action save where it might have been maintained by his assignor Thus where there are two firms with a common mem ber and one of the firms is indebted to the other if the creditor firm assigns its claim to a third person such third person cannot maintain an action against the debtor firm at law because his assignor could not have maintained itit being a wellsettled rule that one firm can not sue another at law where there is a common member since such common member would be both plaintiff and defendantan anomaly which the courts of law will not sanction Aylett v Walker 92 Va 540 24 S E 226 It will sometimes happen that by the operation of an estoppel the assignee will get a better title than the assignor had Thus where one makes his bond to another for the accommodation of the latter in order that the bond may be assigned to a third person to raise money for the obligees benefit the obligor cannot in a suit brought against him by the assignee set off a note for the same amount held by him against the assignor and executed for the very purpose of being used as a set off since this would be a fraud upon the assignee Etheridge v Parker 76 Va 247 Again a promise made by the maker of a commonlaw instrument made to the assignee after the assignment is nudumpactum and not binding Hopkins v Richardson 9 Gratt 485 But if the promise be made before and with a view to the assignment or if the assignee alters his condition for the worse or foregoes any right on 114 JuDe1899 EDITORIAL 115 account of the promise or if when applied to by the proposed assignee for information the debtor assures him that the debt is good and will be paid then the debtor is estopped in a suit brought by the assignee to set up any equities existing between him and the assignor Hans brough v Baylor 2

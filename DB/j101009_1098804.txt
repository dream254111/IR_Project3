STATE SIMILAR IN THIS RESPECT TO THE VIRGINIA STATUTE RENDERS BASTARDS CAPA BLE OF INHERITING AND OF TRANSMITTING INHERITANCE ON THE PART OF THE MOTHER IN THE ABSENCE OF STATUTORY ENACTMENTS IT IS WELL SETTLED THAT BAS TARDS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE WORD CHILDREN UNLESS THERE ARE NO OTHER CHILDREN BUT BASTARDS AT THE DATE OF THE DEED OR WILL AND NO REASONABLE PROBABILITY OF ANY OR IT IS PLAIN

OF A DEVISE OR GIFT TO HIS MOTHERS CHILDREN JUST AS IF HE WERE LEGITIMATE SEE BENNETT V TOLER 15 GRATT 588 THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA IN THE CASE ABOVE REFERRED TO REACHES THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION AND SEEMS TO BE SUPPORTED BY AN ALMOST UN BROKEN LINE OF AUTHORITIES THE COURT CITES AND COMMENTS UPON NUMEROUS AUTHORITIES FROM THE VARIOUS STATES WHERE SIMILAR STATUTES EXIST THE VIRGINIA CASE OF BENNETT V TOLER IS DISTINGUISHED ON THE GROUND THAT IN THAT CASE THE BASTARD WAS IN BEING AT THE DATE OF THE WILL AND WAS KNOWN AND RECOGNIZED BY THE TESTATOR AS HIS DAUGHTERS SON THE REASONING OF ALLEN P IN THAT CASE LEADING TO THE CONCLU SION THAT EVEN HAD THE BASTARD NOT BEEN BORN AT THE DATE OF THE WILL THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME IS DISAPPROVED IN MANY OF THE STATES WHILE THERE IS A FIXED LEGAL RATE OF INTEREST THERE IS ALSO A CONVENTIONAL RATE GREATER THAN THE LEGAL RATE WHEN FIXED BY EXPRESS CONTRACT OF PARTIES AND IT IS PROBABLY THE BETTER DOCTRINE THAT THE CONTRACT WILL CONTINUE TO BEAR THE EXTRAORDINARY RATE AFTER 112 JUNEMATURITY CECIL V HICKS 29 GRATT 6 CROMWELL V COUNTY OF SAC 96 U S 51 AND CA CI IF THE AGREED RATE IS GREATER THAN THE ORDINARY LEGAL RATE THIS DOC TRINE SEEMS TO BE PERFECTLY JUST SINCE THE DEBTOR HAS THE POWER TO PAY THE DEBT AT MATURITY ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE AND THUS AVOID THE FUR THER PAYMENT OF INTEREST IF HE DOES NOT SO PAY IT IS BUT FAIR TO AS SUME THAT HE PREFERS TO KEEP THE MONEY AND PAY THE GREATER RATE AGREED UPON ORIGINALLY BUT WHERE THE AGREED RATE IS LESS THAN THE LEGAL RATE AND THE DEBTOR RETAINS THE CREDITORS MONEY AGAINST THE WILL OF THE LATTER A WHOLLY DIFFERENT PRINCIPLE OUGHT TO APPLY FOR HERE THE CREDITOR HAVING AGREED TO LEND HIS MONEY AT THE LESSER RATE ONLY UNTIL THE MA TURITY OF THE DEBT HE OUGHT NOT TO BE COMPELLED TO ACCEPT THE LESSER RATE AFTER MATURITY IF THE DEBTOR DOES NOT THEN PAY AND REFUSES TO PAY HE OUGHT TO BE COMPELLED TO PAY THE LEGAL RATE IN THE FUTURE OTHERWISE HE IS ENCOURAGED NOT TO PAY AND RECEIVES A REWARD FOR HIS DELINQUENCY THAT THE CREDITOR IS WILLING TO ACCEPT A LESS RATE FOR THE AGREED TIME OF THE LOAN E G ON CALL RAISES NO PRESUMPTION THAT THE PARTIES INTENDED THE LESSER RATE TO CONTINUE AFTER MATURITY OF THE DEBT AND AFTER THE CREDITOR HAS DEMANDED THE RETURN OF THE MONEY IN THE FORMER CASEWHERE THE AGREED RATE IS GREATER THAN THE LEGAL RATETHE DEBTOR MAY REASONABLY BE PRESUMED TO CLAIM UNDER THE CONTRACT BE CAUSE HE HAS CHOSEN TO RETAIN THE MONEY AFTER MATURITY BUT IN THE OTHER CASE CLAIMING AGAINST THE WILL OF THE CREDITOR AND THEREFORE AGAINST THE CONTRACT HE OUGHT TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE LEGAL DAMAGES AND THE LEGAL MEASURE OF DAMAGES FOR NONPAYMENT OF MONEY IS THE LEGAL RATE OF INTEREST IN BOTH CASES THE BURDEN SHOULD BE ON THE DE LINQUENT DEBTOR WHERE THE AGREED RATE IS GREATER THAN THE LEGAL RATE THE BURDEN IS PUT UPON HIM BY COMPELLING HIM TO PAY THE EXTRAORDINARY RATE WHERE THE AGREED RATE IS LESS THAN THE LEGAL RATE THE BURDEN SHOULD LIKEWISE BE PUT UPON HIM BY COMPELLING HIM TO PAY THE LEGAL RATE IF THE LOAN WERE MADE WITHOUT INTEREST CERTAINLY THE CREDITOR WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THE LEGAL RATE OF INTEREST AFTER MATURITY THE SAME RULE SHOULD APPLY WHERE THE CREDITOR HAS BY CONTRACT RELIN QUISHED NOT ALL BUT A PART OF THE LEGAL RATE OF INTEREST AUTHORITIES REQUIRING THE DEBTOR TO CONTINUE TO PAY THE EXTRAORDINARY RATE ARE ABUNDANT

generalizations have been recognized GLACIERS AS CONSERVATIVE AGENTS LEST the opinion in favor of strong glacial erosion should go too far it is well to give special attention to such articles as explain by other processes the particular relation of overdeepened main valleys and hanging side valleys to which so much prominence has recently been given in this connection Bou ney writing on Alpine Valleys in Relation to Glaciers  Quart Journ Geol Soc LVIII 1902 600702 recognizes the preva lently discordant relation of trunk and branch valley in certain parts of the Alps but con cludes on the basis of  personal examination of every part of the Alps of the Pyrenees the Apennines Scandinavia Auvergne and marly other hill and mountain regions that cirques are mainly the work of water and that in a system of valleys denudation would on the whole be checked where glaciers oc cupied the higher tributaries and intensified by the action of torrents in the principal val leys Garwood discussing the  Origin o Some Hanging Valleys in the Alps and lIim alayas Ibid 703715 also concludes that glaciers protect their floors He explains cer tain striking examples of discordance between trunk and branch valleys in the Alps as the result of the accelerated erosion of the trunk valley on account of the steepening of its stream by a tilting of the region while the side valleys at right angles to the direction of tilting are not cut down because their streams are not tilted Kilian presents some Notes pour servir a la geomorphologie des Alpes dauphinoises  La Geographie VI 1902 1726 and insists that the hanging lateral valleys of that district have been pro tected by glaciers while the main valleys have been deepened by normal stream work Lu geon adduces the occurrence of rock sills that rise across certain Alpine valley floors notably a sill known as the Kirchet in the Aar valley above Meiringen and a similar sill in the Rhone valley below Martigny to prove that the ancient glaciers were not de structive agents had they been these sills ought to ha0re been removed their presence is a peremptory argument against the deep ening of valleys by glaciers   Sur la re quence dans les Alpes de gorges epigenetiques et sur lexistence de barres calcaires de quel ques vallees suisses Blsz Iabor de geol Univ de Lausanne No 2 190t 34 pp excel lent plates This author takes no account of the hanging lateral valleys which are scs abundantly associated with the main valleys of the Aar and the Rhone and therefore naturally enough gives much importance to the rock sills which in the theory of strong glacial erosion are explained as residual hard rock inequalities in a muchdeepened valley Eloor The manifest difficulty in the wAy of e2C plaining hanging lateral valleys by the con servative action of the glaciers that once oc cupied them is the necessity of assuming a systematic and persistent termination of many independent glaciers at the mouths of lateral valleys for a period long enough to allow the main stream to deepen its valley by hundreds and to widen it by thousands of feet The difficulty in the way of accounting for overdeepened main valleys by tilting as suggested by Garwood is that in the plentiful examples of tilted and therefoPre dissected districts in nonglaciated regions the side streams cut down the side valleys about as fast as the main stream cuts down the main valley and by the time the main valley is well opened the side valleys enter it at grade in most accordant fashion W M Dsvx8 TE1PJ MISEQURI BOTANICAL AARDEN FROM advance sheets of the administrative report on the Btissouri Botanical Garden presented at the recent annual meeting of the Trustees it appears that the gross revenue for the year was 12443189 and the total ex penditure 11989384 OF which 2S35264 was spent for the maintenance of the garden proper and 8018646 for improvements and extensions in this department 301581 for the herbarium 659540 for the library

which those holding scholarships receive and which is ofEset by their services in the garden 248093 in carrying out bequests made by the founder of the garden and the remainder for expenses connected with the administration and maintenance of revenue property In connection with a popular account of the garden written by the director at the request of the editor of the Popt6lar Science Monthly and published in the January number of that magazine it is interesting to note that a net gain of tS84 species or varieties cultivated at the garden was made in 1902 bringing the total up to tt551 2t052 more persons visited the arden in 1902 than ever before recorded bringing the total up to 112314 for the year the herbarium which now includes 427797 specimens valued at 641695S was increased by the incorporation of 62844 specimens the library which now includes 4t224 books and pamphlets valued at 6750630 was increased by the addition of 2516 books and 2696 pamphlets and the current list of serial pub lications received at the library has been brought up to 1160 The ef3ort which the administration of the garden is making to serve the three principal purposes of lIenry Shaw in founding the garden is evident from the expenditures above recorded for the maintenance of a beautiful and instructive garden by the ewenditure for the instruction of garden pupils and the supportwithin the provisions of Mr Shaws willof the lIenry Shaw School of Botany of Washington University in which in addi tion to undergraduates one candidate for the Masters degree and four for the Doctors de gree in

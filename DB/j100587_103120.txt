SOUTHBRITAIN AND THE USE WHICH MAY BE MADE OF IT BY DR NEHE MIAH GREW FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS SEVERAL PERSONS AND SOME OF GREAT ABILITIES HAVE GIVEN US AS THEY HAVE SUPPOSED THE JUST NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN ENGLAND OR SOUTH BRITAIN OR VE RY NEAR IT THE EXCELLENT SIR WILLIAM  RECKONS ABOUT 28 MILLIONS OTHERS 29 MILLIONS OTHERS A FEW MORE BUT I HUMBLY AFFIRM THEY HAVE ALL BEEN MISTAKEN IN UNDERRECKONING AND THE REASON OF THEIR MISTAKE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THEIR RECKONING ONLY BY THE MAPS THAT IS BY COMPU TED AND NOT BY MEASURED MILES BY WHICH ONLY THE NUMBER OF ACRES CAN BE KNOWN I HAVE SEEN AN ACCOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF ACRES IN EACH COUNTY WHICH ACCOUNT WHETHER TAKEN FROM DOOMSDAY BOOK OR FROM ANY OTHER REGISTRY CANNOT BE TRUE FOR THO WE HAVE LOST SOME LAND YET THERE IS A GREAT DEAL MORE NOW GAINED WHICH IN THE CONQUE RORS TIME LAY UNDER SEA WITHIN 120 YEARS VERY MUCH HAS BEEN RECOVERED OUT OF THE SEAS AND MAIN TAINED BY BANKS IN THE MARSHES AND FENNS OF ESSEX KENT AND THE ISLE OF ELY AND IN SOME PARTS OF LIN COLNSHIRE THE LAND HAS GAINED OF THE SEA 4 MILES IN A DIRECT LINE FROM LAND TO SEA IN THE MEMORY OF MEN NOW LIVING NOR267 NOR IS IT THE TRUER FOR HAVING BEEN TAKEN FROM ANY OTHER RECORD FOR IF THE NUMBERS OF ACRES ACCORD DING TO THE SAID ACCOUNT IN EACH SHIRE BE PUT TOGE THER THEY EXCEED NOT 39 MILLIONS AND A QUARTER WHICH NUMBER THO IT COMES MUCH NEARER TO THE TRUTH THAN ANY OF THE FORMER YET IS A GREAT DEAL SHORT OF IT FOR HOWEVER ACCORDING TO VULGAR COMPUTATION EN GLAND OR SOUTH BRITAIN IS RECKOND IN LENGTH BUT 305 MILES AND IN BREADTH ABOUT 290 MILES NEVERTHELESS IT APPEARS BY AN EXACT WHEELMEASURE THAT FROM NEW HAVEN IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND TO LONDON ARE 56 MEA SURED MILES AND THAT FROM THENCE BY A STRAIT LINE CON TINUED TO BERWICK IN THE NORTH ARE 339 OF THE SAME MEASURED MILES IN ALL 395 MEASURED MILES THE TRUE LENGTH OF ENGLAND AND AGAIN THAT FROM THE SOUTH FORE LAND IN THE EAST TO THE LANDSEND IN CORNWALL ARE A BOUT 367 MILES OF THE SAME WHEELMEASURE THE TRUE BREADTH OF ENGLAND THIS BEING KNOWN IT IS EASY WITHOUT ANY LABORIOUS AND COSTLY SURVEY TO KNOW ALSO HOW MANY SQUARE MILES AND CONSEQUENTLY HOW MANY ACRES ARE CONTAINED IN ENGLAND OR GREAT BRITAIN TO WIT IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER IF A LINE BE DRAWN ON A CHART OF ENGLAND FROM THE SOUTH FORELAND IN KENT TO BERWICK AND FROM THE TWO ENDS OF THIS LINE TWO MORE LINES MEETING AT THE LANDS END IN CORNWAL THEY WILL MAKE THE TRIANGLE A B C  WHICH TRIANGLE IN THAT IT EXCLUDETH AS MUCH MORE OF THE LAND AS IT INCLUDETH OF THE SEA AS MAY ANSWER THE SMALL NUMBER OF MILES OBTAINED BY THE CURVITY OF THE ROADS IT MAY THEREFORE BE ALLOWD TO BE EQUAL TO THE AREA OF ENGLAND OR SOUTH BRITAIN SEE TAB 1 NEXT IF TO THE TRIANGLE A B C ANOTHER SIMILAR AND EQUAL TRIANGLE B C D BE ADDED BOTH TOGETHER MAKE THE RHOMBOID A B D C WHICH BEING DIVIDED AT   MAKETH THE RHOMBOIDS A C E F AND B D E F  ONE268 ONE TO ANOTHER ONE OF WHICH IS THEREFORE EQUAL TO THE TRIANGLE A B C AND THE RECTANGLE A G H F STAND ING UPON THE SAME BASE AND BETWEEN THE SAME PARALLEL LINES WITH THE RHOMBOID A C E F BY THE 35TH OF THE 1ST OF EUCLIDE IS EQUAL TO THE SAID A C E F EQUAL TO THE TRIANGLE A B C EQUAL TO THE AREA OF ENGLAND OR SOUTH BRITAIN NOW THE LENGTH BETWEEN BERWICK AND THE SOUTH FORELAND IN KENT BEING ABOUT 5 MILES MORE THAN BE TWEEN BERWICK AND NEW HAVEN WHICH IS 395 MILES THEREFORE THE LINE A B MAY BE TAKEN FOR 400 MILES  AND SO THE LINE A F FOR 200 AND THE LINE A G BE ING LESS BY ABOUT 7 MILES THAN BETWEEN THE SOUTH FORE LAND IN KENT AND THE LANDS END IN CORNWALL WHICH IS 367 MILES THE SAID A G MAY BE TAKEN FOR 360 MILES THEREFORE A G 360 BEING MULTIPLYD BY A F 200 PRO DUCETH 72000 SQUARE MILES AND 72000 BEING MULTI PLYD BY 640 THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN ONE SQUARE MILE PRODUCETH 46 MILLIONS AND 80000 THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN ENGLAND OR SOUTH BRI TAIN WHENCE IT APPEARS FIRST THAT IF THE PROVINCE OF HOLLAND CONTAINS AS IS COMPUTED BUT ONE MILLION OF ACRES THENENGLAND IS MORE BY A FRACTION OF 80000 ACRES THAN 45 TIMES AS BIG AS HOLLAND NEXT IF IN THE PROVINCE OF HOLLAND CONTAINING BUT ONE MILLION OF ACRES ARE TWO MILLIONS AND 400 THOUSAND SOULS OR TWO MILLIONS AND 4 10THS AS THEY ARE SAID TO BE THEN ENGLAND WHICH CONTAINS 46 MILLIONS OF ACRES TO BE PROPORTIONABLY POPULOUS SHOULD HAVE TWICE 46 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND 4 10THS OF 46 THAT IS ABOUT 110 MILLIONS BUT TO ALLOW ROOM ENOUGH FOR PERSONS OF ALL DEGREES UNDER OUR BRITISH MONARCHY IF ENGLAND WERE HALF AS POPULOUS AS HOLLAND WITH ONLY 55 MILLIONS IT WERE A GOOD269 GOOD PROPORTION AND WOULD BE NEAR 5 TIMES OUR PRE SENT NUMBER AND ABOUT 22 TIMES AS MANY AS IN THE PROVINCE OF HOLLAND TO PEOPLE ENGLAND IN A COMPETENT TIME WITH THIS NUMBER THERE ARE SUNDRY WAYS VERY PRACTICABLE BY WHICH I HAVE COMPUTED THE PRESENT NUMBER MAY BE DOUBLED IN 24 OR 25 YEARS AND PROBABLY QUADRUPLED IN ABOUT 36 YEARS ONE OF THESE WAYS THO NOT THE SPEEDIEST WOULD BE THE INTRODUCING OF STRANGERS YET TO MAKE USE OF THIS OR OF ANY OTHER WAY TO MULTIPLY THE PEOPLE BEFORE WE HAVE PROVIDED THE MEANS OF EMPLOYING THEM AS WAS LATELY DONE WOULD BE PREPOSTEROUS BUT WHEN WE SHALL ONCE IN GOOD EARNEST MIND OUR TRUE INTEREST IN EMPLOYING AND ENCOURAGING EVERY WHERE OUR OWN HANDS AND THE HANDS OF OTHER NATIONS AS THE FRENCH AND DUTCH DO IN ALL THE SORTS OF HUSBANDRY MANUFACTURY AND MERCHANTRY WHEN OUR NOBILITY AND GENTRY THEMSELVES SHALL AS IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES BE EXAMPLES IN SOME OR OTHER OF THESE PARTICULARS WHEN WE SHALL HEREBY BE UNIVERSALLY ENGAGD TO INCLOSE AND TO IMPROVE EVERY FOOT OF OUR LAND TO MAKE THE UTMOST USE OF ALL OUR HOME GROWTHS ABOVE AND UNDER GROUND AND OF ALL OUR PORTS ABOUT 200 GREAT AND SMALL MORE THAN IN ALL THE KINGDOMS AND STATES OF EUROPE PUT TOGETHER AND WHEN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND SHALL BOTH OF THEM AFTERWARDS BE IMPROVED IN LIKE MAN NER WHEN ALL MENS HEADS AND HANDS SHALL BE THUS EMPLOYED ABOUT SOME ONE HONEST AND PROFITABLE BUSI NESS AS IT WILL NATURALLY PROMOTE EVERY WHERE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP AMONG US SO IS IT EASY FOR ANY CONSIDER ING MAN TO FORESEE HOW HIGHLY IT WILL ADVANCE THE BRITISH MONARCHY AND PEOPLE AT HOME AND ALL OVER THE WORLD IN BEAUTY STRENGTH AND GLORY S S II OBSER

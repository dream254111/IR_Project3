long way toward pointing out to the practical man the methods by which he will be able to avoid bringing about those specific changes which end in disease It is cer tainly entirely within the bounds of the possible to know definitely just what par ticular changes lead to disease i e tend to invite a given parasite or a given degen eration and knowing these to put the plant or animal under such conditions as to food light air etc as will lead to the development of counter changes tending to ward off disease A beginning has already been made but much remains to be done and a more inviting field of research does not anywhere lie open to the young and earnest experimenter The socalled  practical man  has gone about as far as he can go and must have help from the technical and laboratory man Personally the speaker has no sym pathy with that line of thinking that would hold the pathologist to the narrowest kind of experimental or field work or which requires him to make bricks without straw Of course I mean bulletins without new discoveries to put in them Nothing is gained by repeated threshing of old straw and time the most precious of all things is lost Haphazard experimenting is not science Every decade will not be fortu nate enough to stumble on a Bordeaux mix ture The trained pathologist should be given plenty of time and the largest lib erty and allowed to work out his own salvation as best he can This he must do very largely by experimental devices and he certainly will never be able to get very far without a thorough technical training and use of the exact methods of the labora tory or as I have already pointed out without chemical knowledge and much as sistance from the chemist and physicist I would not disparage field work It is right as far as it goes and I think every patholo gist ought to have a thorough acquaintance with diseases as they occur in the field but a man may work all his life in the field and never get beyond a rule of thumb if he does not also have that technical training which is usually acquired only in the labo ratory The pathologist must be able to see all that the practical man sees and a great deal more In other words he must not only see that things go on in a certain way in the field but he must also be able to probe beneath the surface and determine why It is then often not difficult for him to make nature conform to some other and better plan whereby harvests are saved and the hungry are fed ERWIN F SMITH U S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF LEGISLATION GOVERNING THE LOBSTER INDUSTRY CAUSES OF THE DECLINE THE causes of the growing scarcity and the yearly diminishing average size of the lobsters caught are 1 The natural de mand arising from an increasing popula tion This increased demand has not been met by a correspondingly increased source of supply 2 The existing laws for the reason that the destruction of adults has been permitted The present laws with their practical difficulties of enforcement have had an adequate trial The decline of the lobster industry demonstrates that these laws have proved inefficient for in creasing or even for maintaining the sup ply The chief defect of the present laws seems to lie in permitting the destruction of adults SUGGESTIONS FOR REMEDIAL LEGISLATION Of the suggestions for legislation to check this decline seven either singly or in  Abstract

promi nent 1 A close season a for a portion of each year or b for a term of years 2 The continuance of the present 10I inch law under more effective enforce ment 3 The substitution of a 9inch law 4 The prohibition of the killing of egg bearing lobsters 5 The prohibition of the killing of any female lobsters 6 The removal of all restrictions as to catching And finally as an entirely new proposi tion which I personally venture to ad vance 7 The protection of all adult lobsters bove the breeding age and the removal of restrictions on the catching of the im mature which are of satisfactory market able size A just and adequate law which meets most requirements wherever identical con ditions obtain will increase the chances of securing effective uniform legislation throughout the lobsterproducing districts An impartial balancing of the merits and defects of the several propositions is here attempted 1 A Close Seasona For a portion of the year A close season may bring manifest and satisfactory results in cases where the animal is a rapid breeder or where the young reach maturity in a short time But a close season is not equally ap plicable for checking the numerical decline of every or any particular animal This is notably true of the lobster A close sea son must fail to bring the expected results for the reason that the lobster is a slow breeder laying eggs but once in two years and carrying these eggs attached to the modified legs under the abdomen for ten or eleven months after laying while the young require probably from four to seven years to reach maturity and attain a length of seven to ten inches Finally the fundamental defect of a closeseason law is that it restricts the de mand but does not adequately and econom ically increase the supply Aside from the practical difficulties of securing a uniform close season through out the lobster range and enforcing the laws the value of the close season to the lobster as a race is commensurate with the duration of this close season The longer it extends the better for the lobster but the worse for man The burden upon in vestments in the lobster fisheries is in creased The absence of the lobster from the human food supply is felt by the pub lic Yet all this is of little avail for the effects of the close season are not perma nent The causes of the decline have not been removed The lobsters through a close season either from one to six months each year may have a chance to catch up only to be themselves caught up with redoubled energy resulting in a glutted market and consequent economic waste for a time with the certainty of a rapid return to the former conditions which made a close season necessary b Close season for a term of years Most of the foregoing statements apply also to a close season for a term of years The primary inherent defects in the close sea son are that it does not reach the cause of the decline and it fails to recognize the fact that the lobster can and should be reckoned as a perennial and perpetual food for man Human effort can so control conditions that the supply may be large or small By taking proper measures the lobster supply can be made abundant and continuous instead of intermittent 2 and 3 Continuance of Present Length Law or Substitution of AnotherThe 9 SCIENCE 613N S VOL XV No 381 and 10inch laws are the ones which have met widest favor They are identical in inconvenience of application and in diffi culty of enforcement Neither the 9inch law in New York the 9inch and female lobster with spawn at tached in Connecticut 9inch and a closed season in Rhode Island 10inch in Mas sachusetts 10tinch and female lobsters while carrying their spawn or hatching their young in New Hampshire 10iinch since 1897 in Maine nor the 101inch and a closed season from June 30 to January 14 in the Maritime Provinces has pre vented the continued rapid decline in 1 the number of lobsters caught 2 the average size of the lobsters caught 3 the average number of eggbearing females reported 4 the number of persons who can depend upon the fisheries for support or 5 has checked the rapid rise in the price of lobster meat Further these laws have been found by experience to be difficult of application and expensive in enforcement and alike dis agreeable to officer and offender The sole apparent merit of this law seems to be that it does prevent the catch ing of some lobsters just how many is dependent upon the honor of the fishermen and the means of enforcing the law Its greatest defect and from a scientific point of view an irreparable one consists in the fact that it affords no protection to those lobsters which most need protectionthe mature breeding individualsbut puts a premium on their capture through tacitly specifying that only adults above the breeding age shall be killed What would be the effect upon our supply of poultry and eggs if a law should be made protect ing poultry under one year or under a certain size or weight It absolutely ig nores the biological laws which man has found by experience to be of the utmost importance wherever it has become neces sary to increase the natural food supply to meet the increasing populationthe pro tection of the adult animal in order to secure a supply of young of that species 4 The Prohibition of the Killing of Egg bearing LobstersTo prohibit the killing of any eggbearing lobsters is good legisla tion so far as it goes but it is open to the objection that it pushes into prominence the temptation to comb off the eggs and thus make the lobster a marketable one It has practical difficulties of enforcement 5 The Prohibition of the Killing of any Female LobstersThe prohibition of the killing of any female lobster would promise more effectiveness were it not for the fact that it involves catching and a subsequent sorting and liberation 6 The Removal of all Restrictions as to CatchingThe proposal to remove all re strictions as to catching lobsters must inevi tably lead to the destruction of the indus try unless a sufficient artificial supply can be maintained to meet the demand and thus far this seems impracticable Cer tainly satisfactory results have not been reached in the case of the lobster though further investigation and examination must yield farreaching results 7 The Protection of All Adult Lobsters Above the Breeding Age etcThe method of protecting all the adults and catching only a portion of the young promises very satisfactory results in the case of the lob ster for the reasons 1 That the ratio of the biological i e reproductive value increases very rapidly after the size of nine to ten inches has been reached as shown by Professor Herricks table 2 The number of enemies diminishes very rapidly as the lobster increases in size 614 SCIENCEAPRIL 18 1902 SUGGESTIONS FOR NEW LEGISLATION The logical basis then for the law is 1 Protect the adults Catch only the small lobsters not the large ones 2 Protect enough of the young to ensure a sufficient number of adults 3 Protect those below a size which ex perience has shown to be adapted for eco nomic use say six inches 4 Use only a legal standard pot having the opening of such size as to prevent the entrance of a lobster say above nine or ten inches and with slats far enough apart and numerous enough to insure the escape of all lobsters less than six inches Fix a date when all pots shall conform to the standard 5 Penalize the possession or sale of lob sters above ten inches and below six inches and of pots not conforming to the legal standard 6 Establish a State committee to co operate with similar committees from the other lobsterproducing States and the British maritime provinces for considering the advantages and possibilities of uniform lobster laws for coordinated investigations of the important economic facts in the nat ural history of the lobster and for devis ing improved methods of artificial lobster culture Rhode Island is obtaining very valuable and practical results on some im portant phases of the question under the direction of Professor Mead The chief apparent objections are 1 That such a proposal as has been out lined is too radical too great a departure from precedents and from the laws in force in other States To this it may be an swered that the existing lobster laws have little commonsense foundation they have been based upon misconceptions and often no doubt upon ignorance and local poli tics they are directly contrary to scientific experience and the continued decline of the lobster industry has proved them to be ineffective for the purposes for which they were instituted They are based neither upon the laws of human economy nor upon the natural history of the lobster 2 It has been claimed that such laws as those proposed would lead to the capture of all the lobsters At first an actually greater number of lobsters would undoubt edly come into the market but the in creased number of individuals killed would not result in such an increased weight as to materially affect market conditions and the productive capacity of the protected individuals would be expected to more than offset the apparent loss from the mar keting of immature individuals In other words the actual value of one above ten inches long in potential productive capac ity is many times that of one between six and ten inches long and man could use as food a larger number of sixinch lobsters without doing the biological damage which results from the killing of a single lobster of from nine to eleven inches long and at the same time have an actually greater weight of lobster meat If it is feared that under this proposal the lobster does not get sufficient protection make the limit still narrower say from between eight or nine inches to six inches 1 Such a law would be relatively easy of enforcement through the inspection of lobster pots 2 It would work a minimum injury to vested interests since sufficient time can be given to make all pots conform to the standard 3 It does not remove the lobster from the market and so does not interfere with the immediate or future interests of fisher men dealers and consumers 4 By protecting those lobsters which are of greatest biological value the interference SCIENCE 615616 SCIENCE with the natural laws of increase is mini mized 5 It furnishes a basis for uniform legis lation throughout the lobsterproducing section Being based upon common sense and in close conformity with the natural history of the lobster and with human sci entific experience with food supplies it commends itself to fishermen and others who know human nature and the lobster in a practical way Finally the proposed law while funda mentally scientific is eventually a com promise measure and combines the advan tages 1 of a close season throughout the year for a part of the lobsters i e for those productive adults above a size to be agreed upon and 2 of the size limit thus meeting the wishes of the believers in both the 10 and 9inch laws It seems to promise effectiveness in meeting exist ing conditions and in checking the decline It is adapted for ready enforcement with out resort to methods distasteful to officers and people and at a minimum expense to the state GEORGE W FIELD BIOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT MASSACHIUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MEMBERSHIP OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIA TION

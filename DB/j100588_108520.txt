umbilicatus compared with that of Nautilus Pompilius By JOHN DENIS MACDONALD RN AssistantSurgeon of HMSV Torch commanded by Lieut WILLIAM CHIMMO RN tender to HMS Herald Captain II M DENHAM RN FRS commanding the Expedition to the South Seas Comrnmunicated by Sir WILLIAM BURNETT K CB amc Received February 22Read March 22 1855 HER Majestys SteamnVessel  Torch having visited the Isle of Pines in the month of July 1854 one of the officers had the good fortune to pick up a recent specimen of Nautilus umbilicatus on the outer reef off Observatory Island The creature had most probably been thrown up by the waves and remained within a ledge of coral wvhen the spring tide receded The natives frequently find Nautili entrapped in this way but we could not prevail upon them to bring us the recent animals although a lileral remuneration was offered The specimen forming the subject of the present paper was alive when brought on board but it was too much exhausted to exhibit any active movements when placed in a vessel containing seawater On touching the tentacula they curlel up or moved about irregularly and the muscular fibres of the funnel lobe contracted slowly without however producing respiratory currents A considerable portion of the posterior part of the hood appeared to have been eaten away by some predaceous enemy but in other respects the animal was perfect On comparing the Nautilus Pompilius with Nautilus umbilicatus in the recent state besides the remarkable differences existing between their respective shells one is struck with the deep position of the latter animal when fully retracted the space between the upper surface of the hood and the lip of the shell being so considerable that in the lateral view no part of the creature is visible On the other hard the animal of N Pompilius completely fills the chamber of occupation and inany of the tentacula with a large portion of the hood rise above the peristome of the shell so that when the soft parts are removed the rounded orifice of the siph uncle may be distinctly seen in the lastformned septum Not so however with N umbilicatus on account of the great depth of the chamber in which the animal is lodged the open ing of the siphuncle cannot be seen in the empty shell It must be remembered however that when a new septum is formed the last chamber is comparatively shallow and it continues to deepen as new additions are made to the lip of the shell until the development of another septum is necessitated Apart from the slls these two species if indeed they may be considered distinct so 2 P2278 MR J D MACDONALD ON THE ANATOMY OF NAUTILUS UMVBIITCATUS closely resemble each other as to render it very much easier to trace out their simji larityv in corresponding parts than to deteimine essential differences between them T he specimen of N umbilicatus examined proved to be a femtale a fact which may serve to modify the views of those who adopting the ingenious speculations of 1JORBIGNY with reference to the sexes of the Ammitonites as indicated by the cha racters of their shells apply them also to the several kinds of Nautili known Tlb1e numbers of the different

seeing that in so doing I should be needlessly repeating all those particulars so succinctly detailed by Professor OWEN With respect to the N Pompilius I therefore purpose making some observations oni the microscopic anatomy of the organs of the special senses and the glan dular follicles appended to the four vessels which convey the blood from the sinussystem to the branchive and in the exp lanation of the figures I shall note as they occur all the more important miatters bearing on the question as to Whether the NV umbilicatus is to be regarded simhply as a variety of N Pompilius or as an originally distinct species Organ of VisionTo my former observations on the minute anatomy of the eye in N Pompilius I have little more to add as they are alike applicable to N umbili catus I am more fully satisfied than ever that the pigmentary coating is subjacent to the retina and that the filamentous ends of the fusiform cells of the formner comn mingle with the finely granular and vesicular Matter of the latter I have reason to believe also that the long axes of the pigmentcells themselves are perpendicular to the surface of the retina like the clubshaped bodies Of JACOBS membrane and parallel examples to this are found in the eyes of somne marine Ann elidanus I have not been able to trace ta vestige of a lens nor do I believe that such can exist  and the Only representative of a vitreous h umiour is a kind of viscosity which appears to protect the retina from the direct action of the seaxvater The exterior of the eye Plate XIV fig 1 a was marked at the back part and in the region of the puipil with blotches of the same rich brown pigment which tinted the upper surface of the hoo an a few of thtntcua sheathsCOMPARED WITH THAT OF NAUTILUS POMPILIUS 279 Organ of HearingThe thorough investigation of the various systems and organs of an animal previously almost wholly unknown with a single mutilated specimen at the disposal of the anatomist is attended with difficulties which can only be surmounted by the accomplished dissector An undertaking of this kind felt to the lot of Professor OWEN when he entered upon the examination of the first recent Pearly Nautilus that reached the shores of England and the beautiful monograph resulting from the right use of this single opportunity is a lasting memorial of the genius of its author The organ of hearing seems to have been the only matter of any importance that escaped the scrutiny of the Professor and although 1 have been fortunate enough myself to discover the auditory capsules in the recent N umbilicatus I can easily conceive the difficulty of detecting them in a specimen long preserved in spirits which renders the tissues opaque and illadapted for microscopic investigation The acoustic capsules in my specimen were about onetwelfth of an inch in dia meter subspherical in form and situated at the union of the supra with the suboeso phageal ganglia but more especially connected with the short pedicle of the anterior division of the latter Plate XV fig I d I have been induced to look for them in this locality beating in mind the condition of the organ of hearing in most Gastero poda and recognizing the close affinity of the Nautilus to this order In every instance the supracesophlageal ganglia occupy the cephalic region but on account of the great length of the neck and body anterior to the visceral nucleus in Heteropoda the suboesophageal nervous masses suffer the maximutml amount of backward displacement and the whole nervous system approximattes the Ihomogangliate type In this extreme case the ear is still preserved in the neigh bourhood of the eye and the special centres of vision and audition are incorporated with the supracesophageal ganglia from which both the auditory and optic nerves arise The inner wall of each earsac in the Nautilus is somewhat flattened lying in con tact with the nervous matter but its more convex external surface rests in a little depression on the upper and internal border of the cephalic cartilage It is enve loped in a kind of fibrous tissue and filled with a cretaceous pulp consisting of minute elliptical otokonia which when under a high power present a bright and strongly refracting point near each extremity These particles vary much in size and are sometimes curiously combined so as to appear double or assume the form of a star or cross c This simple auditory apparatus may be readily exposed by making an incision externally in the deep groove between the funnel lobe and the basal part of the tentacular sheaths immediately in front of the hollow subocular process The cilia lining an auditory sac containing minute otokonia are always much finer than those required to impart a rotatory motion to a single spherical otolithe I have not observed themn in the ear of the Nautilus although I cannot for a momnent doubt their existence280 MR J D MACDONALD ON THE ANATOMY OF NAUTILUS UMBILICATUS VALENCIENNES traced three small nervous filaments into a cavity of the cephalic cartilage which he says was filled with a homogeneous pulp and did not contain any kind of conciretions but not having had the opportunity of perusing his original memoir on the N Pompilius in which animal he observed this structure I cannot determine with any degree of certainty the parts to which he refers From my own observation I can scarcely imagine that the nature of the venous sinus which excavates the cephalic cartilage on either side could be mistaken by a well informed anatomist and yet there is nmuch probability in the suggestion of Pro fessor OWEN that this is the locality to which VALENCIENNES assigns the organ of hearing As our knowledge of the Mollusca advances the localization of the special centre of audition as well as the nature of the contents of the simple capsules which shadow forth the vestibule of the more perfect apparatus of hleating will prove of great im portance to the natural classification of these animals Thus even with respect to the contents of the capsules we find spherical otolithes present in the Heteropoda Pectinibranchiata and several other orders and otokonia in the Pulmonifera and as far as I have been able to discover except while yet in theirembryonic state in the whole of the Pteropoda including PERONS Phyllirho which is more closely allied to these last than to the Gasteropoda Now as we know that the earchambers in the dibranchiate Cephalopoda contain single otolithes of large proportional size although this rule may not be general in its application it would not be unreasonable to con clude from the evidence afforded by the Nautilus that the auditory sacs of the ex tinct Tetrabranchiata were distended with minute pulverulent otokonia Organ of TasteAlthough a doubt may still exist as to the locality of the olfac tory sense in the Nautilus this can hardly be said of the organ of taste the mucous mnembrane of the mouth is so richly supplied with sentient papilla These bodies are distributed in three principal groups thus a considerable number beset a stout vertical fold of the lining membrane extending on either side from the root of the tongue to the back of the pharynx The papilla are more numerous on the inner side and along the free border of each fold in order to give them a greater extent of motion and render themD opposable to the remaining group Plate XV fig 4 b which occupies the median line between the orifice of the tonguesac a and the commencement of the oesophagus e and although placed a little posterior to the organ usually recognized as the tongue in the higher Mollusca they may with great propriety be named the lingual papilla to distinguish them from the others All the papillae agree however in their general character and minute anatomy being either simple or compound exhibiting much irregularity in form and being clothed with long and delicate columnar epithelial cells the homogeneous basement mem brane enveloping a kind of areolar tissue Renal OrgansIt is reasonable to suppose that an animal possessing a complex digestive system for the seduction of crude animal matter should be also furnishedCOMPARED WITH THAT OF NAUTILUS POMPILIUS 281 with renal glands to separate from the blood those deleterious principles which must otherwise accumulate In the Nautilus there are no organs to which this function can be more justifiably assigned than the numerous glandular follicles appended to the vessels which convey the blood from the sinus system to the branchive admit ting also that by altering theit capacity they may serve to regulate the amount of blood circulating through the respiratory apparatus under those changes of pressure which the animal must experience in sinking to great depths and rising in its watery element MAYER suggested that the homologues of these follicles in the higher Ce phalopoda were the emunctories of the urine and Professor OWEN considers it more philosophical to conclude that the organs of so important an excretion should be present in all the class than that they should be represented by the inkgland and bag which are peculiar to one order As the most satisfactory method of arriving at a just conclusion however I shall leave further argument for the present and describe the minute anatomy of the organs which may be provisionally called the renal follicles of the Nautilus These follicles are subcylindrical in form somewhat dilated at the free extreemitv to which is appended a folded and funnelshaped process of membrane which ex pands rather suddenly presenting a jagged and irregular border They open by a smooth and oral or slitlike orifice into the afferent pulmonary vessels on each of which as Professor OWEN has observed they are disposed in three clusters The outer membrane is smooth and glossy homogeneous in structure and sprinkled over with minute rounded and transparent bodies probably the nuclei of cells Beneath this layer flat bundles of fibres apparently muscular are trace able here and there principally disposed in a longitudinal direction and sometimes branched The lining membrane consists of a loose epithelial pavement in many respects similar to that of the uriniferous tubules of the higher animals the cells containing besides the nuclei numerous minute oilglobules or a substance much resembling concrete fatty matter This membrane is thrown up into an infinite number of papille and corrugations so as to augment the extent of surface considerably The papillae are more numerous at the inner part or towards the attached end and a circlet of longitudinally dis posed folds radiate from the bottom of the follicles in which a number of small pits or fenestrations is sometimes visible The sides of these folds are wrinkled trans versely so as to present a median zigzag elevation The funnelshaped membranous process above noticed is continuous with the lining membrane consisting of an extension of the same epithelial pavement but the cells are somewhat larger and more regular in form The cavity of each follicle there fore communicates with the exterior through the centre of this process and the aperture is thus guarded by a kind of circular valve permitting the escape of secreted mpatters but effectually preventing the entrance of fluid from without982 MR J O MACDONA1LD ON THE ANATOMY OF NAUTILUS UMBILICATUS Now that grave doubts have been cast upon the existence of the socalled epithe lial investment of the Malpighian tufts of the kidney in Vertebrata the office of these minute vascular bodies would seem to present a solitary example of the secretion of a peculiar fluid directly from the blood or independently of the agency of nucleated cells The glandular follicles of the Nautilus just described appear as it were to go one step further the vascular and secreting portions having so far coalesced as to be almost undistinguishable the one from the other When the Malpighian tufts are excessively distended with the contained blood the albumninous elements pass away with the thinner parts and doubtless congestion of the renal follicles of the Nautilus would be attended by a similar result These views may be still further supported by glancing at the relationships of the kidney liver and respiratory organs in the Vertebrata and Mollusca respectively Thus in vertebrate animals the biliary fluid is secreted from venous blood supplied by the portal system In Mammals the secerning vessels of the kidney are chiefly arterial but in Fishes which possess a distinct portal system in connexion with the kidney the urine is principally separated from venous blood which ultimately com mingles with that returning from the liver before reaching the branchial heart In Mollusca on the contrary the biliary secretion is fiunished from arterial blood and if the glandular follicles of the Nautilus above noticed are veritable renal organs as they evidently appear to be the kidney exchanges place as it were with the liver lying between the great sinus system and the branchiv which return their blood into a systemiic heart It will be perceived therefore that in these respects a remarkable difference exists between the Mammalia and Mollusca but the steps of transition forom the one to the other are so distinctly marked in the intervening classes taken in their natural order that we are enabled more fully to comprehend the nature of this disparity the apparently anomalous position of the renal glands in Nautilus and Sepia and in deed also in certain Gasteropoda and Conchifera in which their function has been more satisfactorily determined being reconciled with the relative anatomy of those organs in animals of higher grades Tfhe body of N umbilicatus is larger and more elongated than that of N Ponmpi lius as it occurs in the South Seas although the specimens of the latter species brought from the Chinese Seas much exceed both in size In the N umbilicatus the longitudinal lamnellve on the median lobe of the external labial processes are divided by a wide groove into two distinct lateral sets and the corresponding lamtellve be tween the internal labial processes are about seventeen in number and of consider able thickness In NV Pomupilius the latter lamellve are much thinner and more numerous and the lateral sets of the former are united together in the median line O On comparing these follicles with their spongy homologues in Sepia for example one cannot fail to ob serve in them a relationship similar to that existing between the lobulated renal organ of the Porpoise and the more condensed and perfect kidney of ManCOMPARED WITH THAT OF NAUTILUS POMPILIUS 283 commencing anteriorly with an azygos transverse lamina In both kinds however I have distinctly traced out the corresponding tentacula with such minor differences as might be expected to occur in different specimens of either separately The ques tion here naturally arisesAre the peculiarities observable in the descriptive and microscopic anatomy of each of sufficient importance to entitle therm to be considered distinct species or are they within the pale of that latitude which must be allowed to variety Any tendency in a being to revert to an original type when such has been deter mined betrays variety but this tendency in the Xautili now under consideration is never manifested by the occasional occurrence of specimens presenting characters which place them intermediate between N Pompilius and N umbilicatus Having visited the Fijii Islands since my former paper on the N Pompilius was written I find that the umbilicated NVautili are not known to the natives although N Pompilius is very plentiful but at Fatuna or Walliss Island where both are found the people recognize the difference between them depending upon the presence or absence of umbilical pits Now although particular localities with all attending circumstances may favour the production of varieties yet the permanence of the distinctive characters of these Nautili without symptom of amalgamation and the discovery of a female specimen of T umbilicatus strongly support the view that they are distinct species though very closely allied EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES PLATE XIV Fig 1 Left lateral view of N

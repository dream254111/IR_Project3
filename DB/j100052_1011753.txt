BY JOHN WANAMAKER Philadelphia The application to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia during the month of September just past for a charter for the American University of Applied Commerce and Tradethe first of its sorthas brought perhaps rather importantly before the public eye an educational system that for as many as twelve years has been in active operation in a very quiet way under the title of The John Wanamaker Commercial Institute A StoreSchool it is commonly called by those who know it for it is an organization inside the Wanamaker store in Philadelphia to enable those who are doing the days work and earning a living to get a better education to earn a better living It is the first actual school of practice of business methods giving daily opportunities to obtain a working education in the arts and sciences of commerce and trade When a young man graduates from it he receives a degree which is in effect a combination of what Harvard College calls the degree of Master of Business Adminis tration with a certificate of a certain number of years actual ex perience in the business world His career and the development of his earning capacity have not had to wait until his college course endedthe two have marched along shoulder to shoulder study assisting labor and labor in turn illuminating and illustrating book knowledge The two together daily increase his value to his employer and to himself The idea of the commercial institute now developing into the American University of Applied Commerce and Trade came long ago to the writer with a realization of the full and sacred obligations of employer and employee The payment of an agreed wage from one to the other the taking in exchange specified hours of labor and the continuation of this mechanical system through weeks and months and years define neither an employers relation to his people nor the duty of the workers to one who happens to control their output of energy and brains I5IThe Annals of the Amnerican Academy Every man who studies along the fine and broad lines of com mercial enterprise today must recognize the fact that a business career is a profession as noble in its way as that of the lawyer or the engineer Men and women must be trained for it They must become specialists The little boy who comes into a store forced by the driving necessity to begin the task of earning a livelihood must not for the honor of the profession be allowed to drift along un disciplined and unlessoned in the science of his work He must not for his own sake be permitted to stand dead to development content to live on the small stock of educational provisions that he laid in before his working days commenced From some such threads of thought as these sprang the idea of The John Vanamaker Commercial Institute It has never been a part of the business made public and yet it hasbeen the pivot about which the organization of the store staff swings for it largely determines the positions of the younger people their wages and their advancement High standing in the schools records means certain promotion in the section of the store work to which a student is assigned habitual low marks indicating a lack of interest or a lack of capacity without improvement result in a change of names on the payroll Today about 7500 graduates of this commercial institute are showing the mercantile world what new kind of busi ness men and women may be produced by this storeschool Of necessity the time given to recitations in the schoolroom is limited It is little and often and continuous that counts as the horse said every time he put down a foot The smaller boys and girls of the store have their separate school sessions in the morning and reach their posts of duty in the business proper by ten oclock Each pupil has two such sessions a week besides the hours for drill and special training Three hundred older boys have two regular evenings of school each week after a hot supper in the store dining rooms at the close of the business day The faculty of the institute consists of twentyfour teachers some of whom are instructors in the daily schools of Philadelphia and in the curriculum you will find classes in reading writing arithmetic English spelling stenog raphy commercial geography commercial law and business methods A very important development of the school life among the boys is a military battalion of six companies officered by the boys I52The John Wanamaker Commercial In stituce themselves This military phase of the school is the garden where grow the lessons of discipline organization precision and obedience and the health lessons of muscular training that give bodily strength without which successful mental work is impossible A military band of seventyfive pieces and a drum and bugle corps of forty are outgrowths of the organization and happy summer vacation times are spent by the little soldiers tenting in squads on a campground of five acres at Island Heights New Jersey with headquarters at The Barracks by the sea The girls of the store also have their military drills and their own drum and bugle corps while their military band is developing All are trained in singing and there are many incidental interests such as the orchestra to which thirty students belong the mandolin club glee club savings fund etc For those who wish to become proficient in foreign languages there are classes in French and German Attendance at these classes is required of such of our people as need to go abroad in the course of their business dealings but is voluntary with others who are aiming to fit themselves for these positions Progress in the institute goes on by regular system The little boys of the morning school pass by promotion into the older corps and the evening school The girls classes always separate are graded from lowest to highest Boys and girls graduate in due process receiving a diploma that is highly prized as an evidence of experience attainment and good standing in the esteem and respect of the store management They are then fullfledged members of the staff of the particular section of the store in which they are employedno longer boys and girls but men and women of the store trained and fitted into some welldefined division of the activities of this great commercial house Their future is circum scribed only by their personal limitations for it is a great fixed policy of the house to build up from the ranks and the boys and girls of today will be the chiefs of tomorrow Twelve years have not been long enough to perfect this system of business education which has made notable improvements in the methods of work in the character outlook and ethics of the per sonnel of the store Unintelligent and wasteful labor has lessened The wisdom of cooperation and mutual helpfulnss has been recog nized Knowledge of merchandise its production distribution and I53I54 The Annals of the American Academy uses has been increased Principles of control and government and organization have developed I may be permitted to say here that my confidence and firm belief in the value of the commercial institute and its relation and application to the laws of the business has led me to build it into the new Philadelphia store building in stone and iron and cement Yesthere will be special classrooms a library and reading room a gymnasium and swimming pool for the use of the students But that as Kipling says is another story

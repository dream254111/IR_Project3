j100128,Columbia Law Review,1110437,The Progressiveness of the United States Supreme Court,i246307,THE PROGRESSIVENESS OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT During the past two years there has been much agitation directed against the Supreme Court of the United States frequent reference to judicial oligarchy usurpation and the like and demands for fundamental changes in the judicial system under the Constitutions not only of the States but of the United States An evil is alleged to have grown up requiring radical measures for its correctionan evil consisting in the supposed tendency of the National Supreme Court to invalidate by its decisions the liberal and progressive State legislation of the day There is grave danger that through constant iteration the truth of this charge will be assumed and that the discussion will be confined to the form of remedy needed The Bar of this country has too long neglected its duty in allowing this charge to take root in the minds of laymen swayed by unanswered articles in popular magazines and by uninstructed orators on the stump Unless the Bar and the law reviews set the real facts constantly before the people a complete misconception of our greatest Court may prevail to the detriment of its influ ence and of its powers The falsity of the charge is easily to be proved The reformers who claim that the Court stands as an obstacle to social justice legislation if asked to specify where they find the evil of which they complain and for which they propose radical remedies always take refuge in the single case of Lochner v New York decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1905 in which the Court held unconstitutional the bakers Iohour day law of New York1 Yet a single case does not necessarily prove the existence of an evil If the evil is as serious as is claimed it ought to be easy to point out numerous other cases The years I887 to I9II inclusive have constituted the period most productive of progressive and liberaleven radicalsocial and economic legislation in the United States The evil if it exists must have grown up during these years and should appear in the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in cases arising under the due process and equal protection of the Lochner v New York I905 I98 U S 45PROGRESSIVENESS OF SUPREME COURT 295 law clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment for under those clauses practically all State legislation of this kind can sooner or later be brought before that Court The records show that between these years887 to I9II in clusive 2the United States Supreme Court rendered over 560 decisions based on these clauses of the Federal Constitution and involving the validity of State statutes or other form of State action3 Examination of these 560 cases conclusively proves that the alleged evil in the trend of the Court is a purely fancied one for out of these 560 there are only two cases other than the Lochner Case in which any State law involving a social or economic question of the kind included under the phrase social justice legislation has been held unconstitutional by the Su preme Court One of these two possible exceptions is the Con itolly Case4 in which the Court in 1902 held invalid an Illinois antitrust law because it illegally discriminated in favor of cer tain classes the other exception is a case of minor importance the Allgeyer Case5in which in 1897 a Louisiana law depriving citizens of the right to order insurance by mail from foreign insurance companies was held invalid as an interference with liberty of contract Even if it be assumed that all three of these exceptional cases were wrongly decidedthree cases out of 560 yet any court or any official bodyexecutive or legislativewhich on any particular subject makes only three mistakes in twenty five years certainly has a remarkable record Even the People themselves in their referendums or recalls might easily err once every eight years The National Supreme Court so far from being reactionary has been steady and consistent in upholding all State legislation of a progressive type When this fact is once fimly grasped it becomes clear that there is no necessity for the introduction of the new remedyrecall of judicial decisionsor for its applica tion to decisions of State courts on questions involving the police power or social justice For if any State court be found reactionary or inclined to deny the constitutionality of State laws on social or economic matters a very simple remedy is at hand the enactment of a single change in the Federal Judiciary Act 2United States Supreme Court Reports Volumes 123 to 222 inclusive In the nineteen years previousI868 to I886there were only 46 cases decided under the same clauses Connolly v Union Sewer Pipe Co I902 184 U S 540 Allgeyer v Louisiana 1897 I65 U S 578COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW a change urged by many lawyers and Bar Associations The Supreme Court is now confined to passing on only those State statutes whose validity under the Federal Constitution a State court has upheld If that Act shall be amended so as to provide that an appeal may be taken to the United States Supreme Court on a decision of a State highest court denying the constitutionality of a State statute the people of this country can by that very slight change enacted by Congress be fully protected against any reactionary State courts if such exist and practically every State statute involving great social or economic questions can then be quickly and finally passed upon by the Supreme Court of the Nation whose progressiveness cannot be denied The following synopsis of State legislation upheld by the Su preme Court during the past twentyfive years is the best proof of its success in dealing with the new and advancing conditions of modern sociological economical and business life Lawyers and laymen alike may well refresh their memory with the actual record0 LABOR LEGISLATION The Supreme Court has upheld every State labor statute brought before it under these clauses of the Constitution with the single exception of the New York Iohour labor law as follows Wages Etc 8hour day law of Utah for miners 1898 Arkansas law requiring

preventing con tracting for wages on basis of screened coal mined I909 full This synopsis includes only cases appealed under the clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment There are of course many State statutes of a similar nature which have been considered by the Court in cases involving only the question whether the statute was or was not repugnant to the Federal jurisdiction over interstate commerce Such cases will show an equal progressiveness on the part of the Courtthe only statutes of this nature which have not been sustained being those which were a direct interference with the powers of the Federal Government over such com merce The dates given in the text are dates of actual rendering of decisions not dates of enactment of the legislation 296PROGRESSIVENESS OF SUPREME

cases parties have sought to overthrow State lawsover 560 in number between I887 and I9IIit is remarkable that the Court has held unconstitutional only three State statutes dealing with general social or economic conditions i e social justice laws In addition it is true it has held unconstitutional several instances of State legislation or of State action which involved simply private rights of property i e questions of illegal laxa tion and of other forms of actual taking of private property with out compensation No one claims however that the recall of judicial decisions or other radical remedies should be applied to court decisions which simply adjudicate private property rights Even in cases of this nature the Court has held State laws or State action unconstitutional and void in only 34 instances during the past 25 years as follows One street assessment tax act 20 6 acts authorizing taxes court judgments or disposition of property without hearing or reason able notice to property owners30 I act regarding enforcement of mortgages 1 8 acts taxing property outside the jurisdiction of the State32 4 tax acts imposing unlawful discriminations or denying equal protection of

penalties and for failure to provide for a hearing35 and 7 laws depriving corporations of their property without compensation as follows a Nebraska order of a Board requiring a railroad to allow persons to erect an elevator on its property 1896 a Texas constitution depriving a railroad of a vested right 1898 a Michigan law requiring a railroad to issue and accept interchangeable mileage tickets with other roads 1899 a California ordinance forbidding the erection of gas works pre viously authorized I904 an Ohio ordinance granting property of one street railway to another I907 a Kentucky law requiring a railroad to deliver its cars to other roads 9go9 a Nebraska law compelling construction of side tracks etc to private grain elevators without a hearing I9Io3 and I law of Texas requiring railroads losing suit to pay attorneys fees was held to deny equal protection of the law 8973 It thus appears that out of over 560 State statutes or other form of State action adjudicated upon under the due process and equal protection clauses during the last twentyfive years the Court has upheld over 530 it has held invalid only 3 relating to social justice and only 34

Y  H R R Co 1905 I97 U S 544 railroad profit law of Indiana Terre Haute etc R R v Indiana 1903 194 U S 579COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW The actual record of the Court thus shows how little chance a litigant has of inducing the Court to restrict the police power of a State or to overthrow State laws under the due process clause in other words it shows the Court to be a bulwark to the State police power not a destroyer And while its actual record proves the responsiveness of the Court to the changing needs of the times the words of its justices are quite as illuminating and encouraging The modern attitude of the Court was well ex pressed by Judge Harlan in one of its late decisions in I9II in which he said30 Among the powers of the State not surrendered is the power to so regulate the relative rights and duties of all within its juris diction as to guard the public morals the public safety and the public health as well as to promote the public convenience and the common good and that it is with the State to devise the means to be employed to such ends taking care always that the means devised do not go beyond the necessities of the case have some real or substantial relation to the objects to be accomplished and are not inconsistent with its own Constitution or the Constitution of the United States It has frequently been asserted by State courts and by law writers that the scope of the police power is confined to mat ters of public morals public health and public safety Such a restriction however finds no warrant in the late decisions of the Supreme Court for as Judge Harlan said in I90640 Wre hold that the police power of a State embraces regula tions designed to promote the public convenience or the general property as well as regulations designed to promote the public health the public morals or the public safety The criterion of the States power is the public welfare as viewed by the Legislature for as said by Judge Hughes in I91 41 In one case the Court held invalid an order of the Kentucky railroad commission fixing a general tariff of railroad rates but only because it exceded its statutory authority and not because the statute was deemed unconstitutional see Silver v Louisville  N R R Io09 213 U  S75 In an Illinois gas rate case Peoria Gas Co v Peoria I906 200 U S 98 the Court granted a temporary injunction but did not decide whether the rates were confiscatory under the Fourteenth Amendment referring the case to a master to find the facts so also in a Virginia railroad rate case Prentiss v Atlantic Coast Line Co 1908 21I U S 210 the Court merely held that it had jurisdiction but did not invalidate the rates In Amer Sugar Ref Co v New Orleans I9oo I8I U S 277 the Court upheld its jurisdiction but did not decide on the validity of the tax in volved House v Mayes 1911 219 U S 270 0C B  Q R R v Illinois 1906 200 U S 561 592 C B  Q R R v McGuire 19II 219 U S 549 310PROGRESSIVENESS OF SUPREMlE COURT 311 The right to make contracts    is subject also in the field of State action to the essential authority of government to maintain peace and security and to enact laws for the promotion of the health safety morals and welfare of those subject to its jurisdiction And Judge Holmes in I9II expresses the same view42 It may be said in a general way that the police power extends to all the great public needs It may be put forth in aid of what is sanctioned by usage or held by the prevailing morality or strong and preponderant opinion to be greatly and immediately necessary to the public welfare In an able article in a recent law review Judge Swayze of New Jersey says43 The interpolation of the word welfare in addition to the words health safety and morals seems likely to have important results It is apparent however from the whole trend of its recent opinions that the Court itself does not regard the addition of this word welfare as an interpolation or as the introduction of any change in the law which it had previously laid down Thus Judge Holmes in his opinion on the petition for rehearing of the Oklahoma bank guaranty case44 says with reference to his prior decision The analysis of the police power whether correct or not was intended to indicate an interpretation of what has taken place in the past nwt to give a new or wider scope to the power and Judge McKenna had already said in 9go746 referring to a previous case In that case we rejected the view that the police power can not be exercised for the general well being of the community That power we said embraces regulations designed to promote the public convenzience or the general prosperity and in the latest decision of the Court on this subject January 13 1913 Judge Day has said upholding a city ordinance of Chicago fixing the weight of bread loaves 46 This court has had frequent occasion to declare that there is no absolute freedom of contract The exercise of the police power Noble State Bank v Haskell 19I1 219 U S 104 IIO

standards must necessarily limit the freedom of contract which would otherwise exist Such limitations are constantly imposed upon the right of contract freely because of restrictions upon that right deemed necessary in the interest of the general welfare In this connection may be noticed the chargeoften refuted but as often reassertedthat the Court bases its decisions on its own views of the policy of a State law rather than on strict legal doctrines The Court however has time and again announced the exact contrary and in almost every decision of note in the last quarter of a century it has emphasized the point that it has no concern whatever with the wisdom or policy of the legis lation construed Thus Judge Peckham in the Lochner Case said This is not a question of substituting the judgment of the Court for that of the Legislature If the act be within the power of the State it is valid although the judgment of the Court might be totally opposed to the enactment of such a law Judge Harlan said in 191I 4 Much may be done by a State under its police power which many may regard as an unwise exertion of governmental au thority But the Federal courts have no power to overturn such local legislation simply because they do not approve it or because they deem it unwise or inexpedient And Judge Holmes said in the Oklahoma bank case in 191148 We fully understand the practical importance of the question and the very powerful argument that can be made against the wisdom of the legislation but on that point we have nothing to say as it is not our concern When the people of this country know and realize the import ance of these facts about its Supreme Court the present agitation based so largely on misconception will die away and all will agree with the patriotic sentiment expressed in I828 by a paper strongly opposed in politics to the Court during the heated States Rights and Nullification perioda period of far more violent agitation against the Court than the present 4 Though the Constitutional construction of this lofty tribunal is not wholly conformable to our humble opinion of right we have 4Brodnax v Missouri 19II 219 U S 285 Noble State Bank v

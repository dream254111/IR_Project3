PRINCIPAL CARE WHICH ALL MEN OWE TO THEIR MORE NECESSARY AND ESSENTIAL DUTIES WHETHER THEY RELATE TO THEIR OWN IMPLOYMENTS OR RE SPECT THEMSELVES OR OTHER PEOPLE IT IS REQUISITE THAT THEY CAREFULLY MAKE CHOICE OF SUCH DIVERSIONS AS ARE AS WELL USEFUL AS ENTERTAINING AND AS INQUIRIES INTO NATURE ARE AGREEABLE TO ALL SORTS OF MEN OF WHAT DE GREE OR STATION SOEVER IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE GREAT EST PART OF MANKIND HAS PREFERD THIS KIND STUDY WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN LOOKD ON AS A RECREATION AND A MEANS TO INSTRUCT AS WELL AS DIVERT THE MIND AND INDEED WHAT AMUSEMENTS CAN WE FIND MORE SOLID AND AGREEABLE OR IN WHAT SCIENCE CAN WE MAKE SO GREAT A PROGRESS WITH SO LITTLE PAINS IT IS NOT THE SAME IN OTHER PARTS OF PHILOSOPHY WHERE KNOWLEDGE IS NOT TO BE ATTAINED WITHOUT PROFOUND MEDITATION AND CONTINUAL LABOUR WHAT A DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWIXT THIS AND OTHER STUDIES THE ONE REQUIRES SOME FEW LEISURE MO MENTS ONLY BUT THE OTHERS A MANS WHOLE TIME HOW THEN CAN WE BLAME THOSE WHO SOMETIMES AMUSE THEMSELVES IN UNFOLDING THE SECRETS OF NATURE WHICH COSTS THEM SO LITTLE OR OUGHT ANY ONE TO DEPRIVE HIM SELF OF THE LIKE DIVERSIONS THE LEAST INSECT OR PLANT OR UNCOMMON STONE MAY AFFORD US AGREEABLE REFLECTI ONS3 ONS IN THE MOST SOLITARY PLACE EVERY THING INDUCES US TO ADMIRE THE INFINITE POWER AND WISDOM OF THE CREA TOR AND I DARE SAY THAT IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THIS WON DERFUL VARIETY WHICH APPEARS IN ALL HIS WORKS THAT HAS MOST CONTRIBUTED TO MAKE THE PAGANS THEMSELVES ACKNOW LEDGE A FIRST BEING TO BE THE SOLE AUTHOR OF THE UNI VERSE PHILOSOPHERS OF ALL AGES AND ESPECIALLY THE MO DERNS HAVE LOOKD ON THIS PART OF KNOWLEDGE AS THE FOUNDATION OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND IN APPLYING THEMSELVES TO SEARCH CAREFULLY INTO MATTERS OF FACT IT WAS ONLY FROM THENCE TO ARRIVE AT LAST AT THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAUSES THE INDUSTRY WITH WHICH THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT PARIS AND WE OF MONTPELLIER HAVE CULTIVATED THIS PART OF PHILOSOPHY WERE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE USEFULNESS OF IT BUT WITH OUT ALLEDGING HERE THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE LEARNED SOCIE TIES WHO SEEM BY THEIR INSTITUTION TO BE PARTICULARLY ENGAGED IN THIS STUDY HOW MANY EMPERORS KINGS PRINCES AND MAGISTRATES HAVE WE SEEN

BE SURPRIZD TO HEAR THAT SPIDERS MAKE A SILK AS BEAUTIFUL STRONG AND GLOSSY AS COMMON SILK THE PREJUDICE THAT IS ENTERTAINED AGAINST SO COMMON AND DISPICABLE AN INSECT IS THE REASON WHY THE PUBLICK HAS BEEN HITHERTO IGNORANT OF THE USEFULNESS OF IT AND INDEED WHO WOULD EVER HAVE IMAGIND IT WHEN THAT OF COMMON SILK AS CONSIDERABLE AS IT IS LAY SO LONG A TIME UNKNOWN AND NEGLECTED AFTER ITS DISCOVERY IT WAS IN THE ISLAND OF  COUS THAT PAMPHILA DAUGHTER OF PLATIS FIRST FOUND OUT THE INVENTION OF WORKING IT THIS DISCOVERY WAS SOON AFTER KNOWN TO THE ROMANS WHO BROUGHT THEIR SILK FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE  SERES WHERE SILKWORMS NATURALLY BREED BUT FAR FROM MA KING ANY ADVANTAGE OF SO USEFUL A DISCOVERY THEY COULD NEVER IMAGINE THESE WORMS SHOULD PRODUCE SO BEAUTIFUL AND VALUABLE A THREAD AND MADE A THOUSAND CHYME RICAL CONJECTURES ABOUT IT SO THAT THEIR IGNORANCE AND IDLENESS TOGETHER MADE SILK FOR SEVERAL AGES SO EXTRA ORDINARY SCARCE AND VALUABLE THAT IT WAS SOLD FOR ITS

RECEIVED THE INGENIOUS FABLE OF  ARACHNE SHOWS US THAT IT IS TO THE SPIDER WE OWE THE FIRST HINTS OF WEAVING CLOATH AND LAYING NETS FOR ANIMALS SO THE CONSTANT ADVANTAGE WHICH I AM SATISFYD MAY ARISE FROM THIS INSECT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE IT HEREAFTER ESTEEMD AS HIGHLY AS SILKWORMS AND BEES WHICH OF ALL INSECTS ARE THE MOST NECESSARY AS WELL AS WONDERFUL IN THEIR WORKS THO THE HISTORY OF SPIDERS BE VERY LARGE AN AC COUNT OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIES WHICH ARE OBSER VABLE IN EACH DIFFERENT KIND I THINK IT NOTWITHSTANDING ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN A FEW WORDS TO GIVE A GENERAL AND CURSORY ACCOUNT OF THIS INSECT BEFORE I ENTER UPON THE DESCRIPTION OF ITS SILK I SHALL THEREFORE REDUCE ALL THE DIFFERENT SORTS OF SPIDERS TO TWO PRINCIPAL KINDS VIZ SUCH AS HAVE LONG LEGS AND SUCH AS HAVE SHORT ONES THE LATTER OF WHICH FURNISHES THE SILK I AM NOW SPEAKING OF IN RESPECT OF THEIR PARTICULAR DIFFERENCES THEY ARE DISTINGUISHD BY THEIR COLOUR SOME BEING BLACK OTHERS BROWN YELLOW GREEN WHITE AND OTHERS OF ALL THESE SEVERAL COLOURS MIXT TOGETHER THEY DIFFER LIKEWISE IN THE NUMBER AND POSITION OF THEIR EYES SOME HAVING SIX OTHERS EIGHT AND OTHERS TEN DIFFERENTLY PLACED UPON THE TOP OF THE HEAD AS MAY EASILY BE SEEN BY THE NAKED EYE BUT MUCH BETTER BY THE HELP OF A GLASS THESE ARE THE PRINCIPAL DIFFE RENCES THEY BEING ALIKE IN OTHER RESPECTS AS THEIR BODY WHICH NATURE HAS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS THE FORE  PLINIJ HIST NATURAL LIB 7 CAP 56 QUAE QUIS INVENERIT IN VITA FUSOS IN LANIFIOIO  FILIUS ARACHNES LINUM  RETIA ARACHNE INVE NIT PART9 PART IS COVERED WITH A SHELL OR HARD SCALE SET WITH HAIRS IT CONTAINS THE HEAD AND BREAST TO WHICH ARE FIXD ITS EIGHT LEGS EACH OF THEM CONSISTING OF SIX JOINTS THEY HAVE LIKEWISE TWO OTHER LEGS WHICH MAY BE CAL LED THEIR ARMS AND TWO CLAWS ARMED WITH TWO CROOK ED NAILS AND JOYNED BY ARTICULATIONS TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE HEAD WITH THESE CLAWS THEY KILL THE INSECTS THEY FEED ON THEIR MOUTH BEING IMMEDIATELY UNDER NEATH THEM THEY HAVE LIKEWISE TWO SMALL NAILS AT THE END OF EACH LEG AND A SPONGY SUBSTANCE BETWEEN THEM WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY IS OF SERVICE TO THEM WHEN THEY GO UPON SMOOTH BODIES THE HINDER PART OF THE BODY OF THIS INSECT IS JOYNED TO THE FOREPART ONLY BY A SMALL THREAD AND COVERD WITH A THIN SKIN ON WHICH ARE HAIRS OF DIVERS COLOURS IT CONTAINS THE BACK BELLY PARTS OF GENERATIONS AND THE ANUS I SHALL APPLY MY SELF MORE PARTICULARLY TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ANUS AS BEING THE PART FROM WHENCE THE SPIDERS DRAW THEIR SILK IT NOT BEING MY DESIGN TO GIVE A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS INSECT BUT ONLY TO SPEAK OF THEIR SILK AND THE USESULNESS OF IT IT IS CERTAIN THAT ALL SPIDERS SPIN THEIR THREAD FROM THE ANUS ABOUT WHICH THERE ARE FIVE PAPILLAE OR SMALL NIPPLES WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT ONE WOULD TAKE FOR SO MA NY SPINDLES THAT SERVE TO FORM THE THREAD I HAVE FOUND THESE PAPILLAE TO BE MUSCULAR AND FURNISHED WITH A SPHINCTER A LITTLE WITHIN THESE I HAVE OBSERVD TWO OTHERS FROM THE MIDDLE OF WHICH ISSUE SEVERAL THREADS IN A PRETTY LARGE QUANTITY SOMETIMES MORE AND SOME TIMES LESS WHICH THE SPIDERS MAKE USE OF AFTER A VERY MECHANICAL MANNER WHEN THEY HAVE A MIND TO GO FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER THEY HANG THEMSELVES PERPEN DICULAR BY A THREAD AND TURNING THEIR HEAD TOWARDS THE WIND THEY SHOOT SEVERAL OTHERS FROM THEIR ANUS LIKE SO MANY DARTS AND IF BY CHANCE THE WIND WHICH SPREADS THEM ABROAD FASTENS THEM TO ANY SOLID BODY WHICH10 WHICH THEY PERCEIVE BY THE RESISTANCE THEY FIND IN DRAWING THEM IN FROM TIME TO TIME WITH THEIR FEET THEY THEN MAKE USE OF THIS KIND OF BRIDGE TO PASS TO THE PLACE WHERE THEIR THREADS ARE FIXT BUT IF THESE THREADS MEET WITH NOTHING TO FIX ON THE SPIDERS CON TINUE TO LET THEM OUT FURTHER UNTIL THEIR GREAT LENGTH AND THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE WIND DRIVES THEM SUR PASSING THE WEIGHT OF THEIR BODIES THEY FIND THEMSELVES TO BE STRONGLY DRAWN AND THEN BREAKING THE FIRST THREAD WHICH THEY HUNG BY THEY LET THEMSELVES LOOSE TO BE DRIVEN BY THE WIND AND FLUTTER ON THEIR BACKS IN THE AIR WITH THEIR LEGS STRETCHD OUT AND BY THESE TWO WAYS IT IS THAT THEY PASS OVER ROADS STREETS AND THE LARGEST RIVERS ONE MAY HIMSELF WIND UP THESE THREADS WHICH BY REASON OF THEIR BEING UNITED TOGETHER SEEM TO BE BUT ONE WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT A FOOT IN LENGTH BUT I HAVE DISTINGUISHD THEM INTO 15 OR 20 AT THEIR ISSUING FROM THE ANUS WHAT IS FURTHER REMARKABLE IS THE EASINESS WITH WHICH THIS INSECT MOVES ITS ANUS EVERY WAY BY MEANS OF THE MANY RINGS THAT BORDER UPON IT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR EM IN ORDER TO WIND UP THEIR THREADS OR SILK WHICH IN THE FEMALE SPIDER IS OF TWO SORTS HOWEVER I BELIEVE THIS INSECT TO BE ANDROGY NOUS HAVING ALWAYS FOUND THE SIGNS OF A MALE IN SUCH SPIDERS AS LAY EGGS BUT IT BEING OF NO SERVICE TO DIS CUSS THIS PARTICULAR I SHALL RETURN TO MY SUBJECT THE FIRST THREAD THAT THEY WIND IS WEAK AND SERVES THEM FOR NO OTHER USE THAN TO MAKE THAT SORT OF WEB IN WHICH THEY CATCH FLIES THE SECOND IS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE FIRST IN THIS THEY WRAP UP THEIR EGGS AND BY THIS MEANS PRESERVE THEM FROM THE COLD AND SECURE THEM FROM SUCH INSECTS AS WOULD DESTROY THEM THESE LAST THREADS ARE WRAPT VERY LOOSELY ABOUT THEIR EGGS AND RESEMBLE IN FORM THE BAGS OF SILKWORMS THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARD AND LOOSEND BETWEEN THE FINGERS IN ORDER TO11 TO BE PUT UPON THE DISTAFF THESE SPIDERS BAGS IF I MAY SO CALL THEM ARE OF A GREY COLOUR WHEN THEY ARE NEW BUT TURN BLACKISH WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN LONG EX POSED TO THE AIR IT IS TRUE ONE MAY FIND SEVERAL O THER SPIDERS BAGS OF DIFFERENT COLOURS AND THAT AFFORD A BETTER SILK ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE TARANTULA BUT THE SCARCITY OF THEM WOULD RENDER IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE EXPERIMENTS UPON THEM SO THAT WE MUST CONFINE OUR SELVES TO THE BAGS OF SUCH SPIDERS AS ARE MOST COMMON WHICH ARE THE SHORT LEGD ONES THESE ALWAYS FIND OUT SOME PLACE SECURE FROM THE WIND AND RAIN TO MAKE THEIR BAGS IN AS HOLLOW TREES THE CORNERS OF WIN DOWS OR VAULTS OR UNDER THE EAVES OF HOUSES AND BY GETTING TOGETHER A GREAT MANY OF THESE BAGS IT WAS THAT I MADE THIS NEW SILK WHICH IS NO WAYS INFERIOR IN BEAUTY TO COMMON SILK IT EASILY TAKES ALL SORTS OF COLOURS AND ONE MAY AS WELL MAKE LARGE PIECES OF IT AS THE STOCKINGS AND GLOVES WHICH I HERE PRESENT YOU I SHALL NEXT PROCEED TO SHOW THE MANNER HOW I PREPARED THE BAGS TO MAKE THE SILK THAT IS NOW BEFORE YOU AFTER I HAD GOT TOGETHER 12 OR 13 ONNCES OF THESE SPIDERS BAGS I BEAT THEM WELL FOR SOME TIME WITH THE HAND AND A SMALL STICK TO FREE THEM FROM DUST THEN I WASHED THEM IN WARM WATER TILL THE WATER THAT CAME FROM THEM WAS CLEAR AFTER THIS I LET THEM STEEP IN A LARGE POT WITH SOAP SALTPETRE AND SOME PIECES OF GUMARABICK AND LET THE WHOLE BOYLE 2 OR 3 HOURS OVER A GENTLE FIRE THEN I WASHED THEM AGAIN WITH WARM WATER TO FREE THEM FROM THE SOAP AND HAVING LET THEM DRY FOR SOME DAYS I LOOSEND THEM A LITTLE BETWEEN THE FINGERS THAT THEY MIGHT BE MORE EASILY CARDED BY THE COMMON SILK CARDERS EXCEPTING THAT I CAUSED THEM TO USE MUCH FINER CARDS BY THIS MEANS I HAD A SILK OF A VERY PARTICULAR ASHCOLOUR WHICH IS EASY TO BE SPUN AND AS YOU HERESEE AFFORDS A THREAD MUCH12 MUCH STRONGER AND FINER THAN THAT OF COMMON SILK WHICH SHOWS THAT ALL OTHER SORRS OF WORK MAY BE MADE OF IT AND THERE IS NO REASON TO FEAR BUT THAT IT WILL ENDURE ANY TRYALS OF THE LOOM AFTER HAVING PAS SED THAT OF THE STOCKINGWEAVERS HAVING ALREADY SHOWN THE USEFULNESS AND POSSIBILITY OF MAKING THIS SILK THE ONLY DIFFICULTY NOW LIES IN PRO CURING A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF SPIDERS BAGS TO MAKE ANY CONSIDERABLE WORK OF IT AND THIS WOULD BE NO DIFFI CULT MATTER IF WE COULD BREED SPIDERS AS THEY DO SILK WORMS FOR THEY MULTIPLY MUCH MORE AND EVERY SPI DER LAYS 6 OR 700 EGGS WHEREAS THE PAPILIOS OR FLYES OF SILKWORMS LAY BUT 100 OR THEREABOUTS AND OF THIS NUMBER WE MUST ABATE AT LEAST HALF ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR BEING SUBJECT TO SEVERAL DISEASES AND ARE SO TEN DER THAT THE LEAST MATTER HINDERS THEM FROM MAKING THEIR BAGS WHEREAS ON THE CONTRARY THE EGGS OF SPI DERS HATCH OF THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY CARE IN THE MONTHS OF AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER IN 15 OR 16 DAYS AFTER THEY ARE LAID AND THE SPIDERS THAT LAID THEM DIE SOME TIME AFTER AS FOR THE YOUNG SPIDERS THAT ARE BRED FROM THESE EGGS THEY LIVE 10 OR 11 MONTHS WITHOUT EATING AND CONTINUE IN THEIR BAGS WITHOUT GROWING EITHER BIGGER OR LESS TILL THE HOT WEATHER FORCES THEM TO COME FORTH AND SEEK FOOD THE REASON OF THIS IS PLAIN AND NATURAL FOR ALL INSECTS AND A GREAT MANY OTHER ANIMALS AS BEARS SERPENTS MOUNTAIN RATS C THAT LYE HID DURING THE WINTER ABOUND WITH A VISCID MAT TER WHICH IS NOT EASILY PUT IN MOTION SO THAT IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT YOUNG SPIDERS SHOULD LIVE IN THE COLD WEATHER UPON THEIR OWN SUBSTANCE WITHOUT ANY LOSS OF SPIRITS BUT AS SOON AS THE WARM WEATHER COMES IT PUT IN MOTION THIS MATTER AND FORCES THEM TO SPIN AND RUN FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN SEARCH OF FOOD AND AS SOON AS THEY BEGIN TO EAT ONE MAY PERCEIVE THEM TO GROW BIGGER AND BIGGER EVERY DAY FROM WHENCE WE MAY CER13 CERTAINLY CONCLUDE THAT IF WE COULD FIND OUT A WAY OF BREEDING YOUNG SPIDERS IN ROOMS THEY WOULD FUR NISH US WITH A MUCH GREATER QUANTITY OF BAGS THAN SILK WORMS DO FOR I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT OF 7 OR 800 YOUNG SPIDERS THERE SCARCE DIED ONE IN THE YEAR AND ON THE CONTRARY OF A HUNDRED YOUNG SILKWORMS NOT FORTY LIVD TO MAKE THEIR BAGS SO GREAT AND CONSIDERABLE A DIFFERENCE AS THIS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MOVE THE CURIOSITY OF SUCH AS ARE LOVERS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES TO ENDEAVOUR TO FIND OUT A WAY OF BREEDING THESE INSECTS IN HOPES THAT SOME LUCKY CHANCE OR MY OWN INDUSTRY MIGHT FAVOUR ME WITH SO USEFUL A SECRET I MADE USE OF THE FOLLOWING EXPEDIENT TO FURNISH MY SELF WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF THESE BAGS WHICH I NOW PROPOSE TO THE CURIOUS WHO MAY MAKE THE SAME TRYAL OF IT AS MY SELF I ORDERED TO BE BROUGHT TO ME ALL THE LARGE SHORTLEGD SPIDERS THAT COULD BE FOUND IN THE MONTHS OF AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER THESE I SHUT UP IN PAPERS AND PUT THEM INTO POTS AND COVERED THE POTS WITH A PAPER PRICKD FULL OF HOLES WITH A PIN AS WERE LIKEWISE THE SEVERAL PAPERS THAT WERE IN IT THAT THE SPIDERS MIGHT HAVE AIR I FED THEM WITH FLIES AND SOME TIME AFTER FOUND THAT THE GREATEST PART OF THEM HAD MADE THEIR BAGS OF WHICH THESE ARE SOME BUT I MORE EASILY PROCURED A GREAT QUANTITY OF THEM BY PROMISING TO PAY THE SAME PRICE FOR THEM BY THE POUND AS FOR COMMON SILK THIS ADVANTAGE FURNISHED ME IN A SHORT TIME WITH A LARGE QUANTITY AND THEY AS SURED ME THEY FOUND NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING THEM AND THAT IF THEY WERE PERMITTED TO GO INTO EVERY HOUSE WHERE THEY SAW THESE SPIDERS BAGS IN THE WINDOWS THEY CONLD FURNISH ME WITH WHAT I PLEASED SO THAT WE MAY EASILY CONCLUDE THAT THERE ARE SPIDERS BAGS ENOUGH IN THE KINGDOM TO MAKE LARGE PIECES OF WORK AND THAT THIS NEW SILK WHICH I PROPOSE IS NOT SO SCARCE OR DEAR C AS14 AS COMMON SILK WAS AT FIRST AND SO MUCH THE MORE BY REASON SPIDERS BAGS IN RESPECT OF THEIR LIGHTNESS AF FORD MUCH MORE SILK THAN THE OTHERS AS A PROOF OF WHICH 13 OUNCES YIELD NEAR 4 OUNCES OF CLEAN SILK 3 OUNCES OF WHICH WILL MAKE A PAIR OF STOCKINGS FOR THE LARGEST SIZD MAN THESE HERE WEIGH BUT TWO OUNCES AND A QUARTER AND THE GLOVES ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF AN OUNCE WHEREAS STOCKINGS OF COMMON SILK WEIGH 7 OR 8 OUNCES IT IS CERTAIN A GREAT ADVANTAGE MAY BE MADE OF THIS INSECT WHICH THE PUBLICK HAS ALWAYS LOOKD ON AS TROU BLESOME AND DANGEROUS ON ACCOUNT OF ITS VENOM BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU NOTWITHSTANDING THAT SPIDERS ARE NOT VENOMOUS HAVING BEEN VERY OFTEN BIT BY THEM MY SELF WITHOUT ANY ILL CONSEQUENCE AND AS FOR THEIR SILK IT IS SO FAR FROM HAVING ANY VENOM THAT EVERY BODY MAKES USE OF IT TO STOP BLEEDING AND HEAL CUTS AND INDEED ITS NATURAL GLUTEN IS A KIND OF BALSAM THAT CURES SMALL WOUNDS BY DEFENDING THEM FROM THE AIR THESE REASONS OUGHT TO BE SUFFICIENT TO TAKE AWAY THE FEAR AND PREJUDICE THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE AGAINST MAKING USE OF THE SILK OF SPIDERS BUT IS IS NE CESSARY BEFORE I END THIS DISCOURSE TO ADD OTHERS SO STRONG AND SOLID THAT THE MOST OBSTINATE MUST NEEDS BE CONVINCED THAT OF ALL INSECTS SPIDERS LEAST DESERVE THE CONTEMPT OF THE PUBLICK THEIR SILK IS USEFUL NOT ONLY IN RESPECT OF THE MANU FACTURE IT PRODUCES BUT IT USEFULNESS IS MUCH GREATER AND MORE ESSENTIAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE SPECIFICK MEDI CINES THAT MAY BE DRAWN FROM IT IT YIELDS BY DISTIL LATION A LARGE QUANTITY OF SPIRIT AND VOLATILE SALT AND I HAVE FOUND BY COMPARING THAT IT AFFORDS AT LEAST AS MUCH AS COMMON SILK WHICH OF ALL MIXT BODIES YIELDS THE MOST THIS SALT AND VOLATILE SPIRIT WHICH IS DRAWN FROM SPIDERS BAGS IS VERY ACTIVE AS MAY BE JUDGED BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS IT CHANGES THE TINCTURE OF15 OF THE FLOWERS OF TURNSOLE INTO A BEAUTIFUL GREEN EMERAL COLOUR IT CONGELES AND REDUCES TO A SORT OF SNOW THE DISSOLUTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE WHEREAS THE VOLATILE ALCALIES DRAWN FROM HUMAN SCULL HARTSHORN AND DIVERS OTHER MIXT BODIES ONLY RENDER IT WHITE OR MILKY SO THAT THIS NEW ALKALI WHICH I PROPOSE BE ING PREPARED AFTER THE SAME MANNER AS THAT WHICH IS DRAWN FROM THE BAGS OF SILKWORMS IN MAKING THE ENGLISH DROPS SO FAMOUS OVER ALL EUROPE MAY SERVE TO MAKE OTHER NEW DROPS WHICH MAY DESERVEDLY BE CALLED DROPS OF MONTPELLIER WHICH WE NEED NOT SCRUPLE TO MAKE USE OF WITH MUCH GREATER SUCCESS THAN THE OLD ONES IN APOPLEXIES LETHARGIES AND ALL SOPOROUS DI SEASES BY REASON OF THEIR GREAT ACTIVITY AND THEY WILL BE TAKEN WITH LESS REGRET BECAUSE THEIR SMELL IS NOT SO FETID AND DISAGREEABLE I SHALL NOT ENLARGE FURTHER ON THIS SUBJECT BUT RECOMMEND TO THE PHYSITIANS AND CHY MISTS OF THIS SOCIETY THE CARE OF INQUIRING INTO THE O THER USES WHICH SPIDERS BAGS AND THE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE TO BE DRAWN FROM THEM BY A CHYMICAL ANALYSIS MAY AFFORD IN PHYSICK EXPLICATION OF THE T A B L E S TAB 1 A SHOWS THE BELLY OF A SPIDER WITH THE ANUS AND FIVE PAPILLAE FROM

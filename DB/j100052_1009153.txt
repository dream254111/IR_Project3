j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1009153,Consumers Surplus,i242481,BRIEFER COMMUNICATIONS CONSUMERS SURPLUS Without entering into controversy I would like to say briefly that Professor Patten in his able paper in the last number of the ANNALS on  Cost and Utility has miscon ceived what I mean by the term Consumers Surplus He says p 30  The two methods of measuring utility can be illustrated by comparing Professor Marshalls view of consumers sur plus with mine He takes as the utility of the first incre ment of a good what a consumer would give if he possessed only one increment the utility of the second increment is what the consumer would give for it if he had but two in crements and so on In this way he gets the consumers surplus of each article     Suppose I am in a desert with three loaves of bread To the first I might attribute 200 units of pleasure as it would keep me alive to the second say 50 units as it would make me comfortable to the third say 5 units If instead of bread I had three pounds of meat I might attribute to the first pound 300 units of pleasure to the second 75 units and to the third say io units If as a third hypothesis I had both articles to the amount named could I add the two surpluses 255385 and say I had 640 units of pleasure Certainly not This is not perfectly explicit but I can understand it only as meaning that he would expect me to add them together in such a case And indeed he continues a little later on   Professor Marshalls consumers surplus would be much larger than mine because he estimates the surplus not from a given situation of the consumer but from a series of situ ations representing different stages of supply It seems to 618CONSUMERS SURPLUS 91 me misleading to add together the surplus under a variety of abnormal situations and call the sum the consumers surplus because it implies that the given surplus is really obtained by the consumer This is not true as no consumer can be in all these situations at the same time nor do any number of consumers find themselves in the variety of situa tions which would make the consumers surplus from the whole commodity correspond to the supposition which Pro fessor Marshall makes If I have interpreted him rightly he has interpreted me wrongly For my demand schedulefrom which my con sumers rent or surplus is derivedrepresents the prices at which various quantities of a commodity say bread can find a market In the case of any individual purchaser these prices represent marginal utilities of successive ele ments But in every Case all other things are supposed to remain unchanged and particular stress is laid on the fact that there is no change in the conditions of supply of any other commodity say meat which is a  rival to it the bread and can partially satisfy the same needs For instance on p 157 immediately after formulating the  Law of Demand I write  It must be remembered that the demand schedule gives the prices at which various quantities of a thing can be sold in a market during a given time and under given conditions If the conditions vary in any respect the figures of the schedule will probably require to be changed and this has constantly to be done when the desire for anything is mate rially altered by a variation of custom or by a cheapening of the supply of a rival commodity or by the invention of a new one For instance the demand schedule for tea is drawn out on the assumption that the price of coffee is known but a failure of the coffee harvest would raise the prices through out the demand schedule for tea and again the demand for gas is liable to be reduced by an improvement in electric lighting    The question where the lines of division  Second edition Nearly the same words occur on p I6o of the first edition 6r992 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY between different commodities should be drawn must be settled by the convenience of the particular question under discussion For some purposes it may be best to regard Chinese and Indian teas or even Souchong and Pekoe teas as different commodities and to have a separate demand schedule for each of them While for other purposes it may be best to group together commodities as distinct as beef and mutton or even as tea and coffee and to have a single schedule to represent the demand for the two combined but in such a case of course some convention must be made as to the number of ounces of tea which are taken as equivalent to a pound of coffee See also pp 4389 in both editions But the passage which most closely follows the lines of Pro fessor Pattens remarks is in a note in the Appendix p 753 referring to the passage in the text which contains my definition of consumers surplus it runs  If however an amount b of the commodity is necessary for existence the utility of the first element a will be in finite or at least indefinitely great for values of x less than b We must therefore take life for granted and estimate separ ately the total utility of that part of the supply of the com modity which is in excess of absolute necessaries  If there are several commodities which will satisfy the same imperative want as e g water and milk either of which will quench thirst we shall find that under the ordinary conditions of life no great error is introduced by adopting the simple plan of assuming that the necessary supply comes exclusively from that one which is cheapest This last passage seems almost to anticipate Professor Pattens problem about bread and meat and to state clearly how I would treat it I will however confess that my account of consumers surplus would be improved by fuller explanation even at the expense of some repeti tion As it stands it has misled other people besides Professor Patten though not so far as I know exactly in the same way  P 740 of the first edition 62093 Perhaps I may be allowed to end with an Englishmans expression of admiration tinged perhaps a little with envy at the generous opportunities which the rapidly growing number of American universities is offering for advanced economic study and at the zeal and ability with which these opportunities are being turned to account ALFRED MARSHALL Cambridge England

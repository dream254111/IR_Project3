J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109020,ON THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL GALLUS DOMESTICUS,I207024, 755  XXIX ON THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOVWL GALLUS DOMESTICUS BY WILLIAM KITCHEN PARKER FRS RECEIVED NOVEMBER 25 1868READ FEBRUARY 11 1869 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS IN MY FORMER PAPER WHICH TREATED OF THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL IN THE OSTRICHTRIBE I PROPOSED TO WRITE A SERIES OF SUCH PAPERS ON THE SKULL OF THE VERTE BRATA AND THAT THE FIRST OF THESE SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THAT OF THE COMMON FOWL THIS BIRD IS SELECTED FOR SEVERAL REASONS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THE READINESS WITH WHICH IT MAY BE OBTAINED BUT AS FAR AS SCIENCE IS CONCERNED A STILL MORE IMPORTANT REASON LIES IN THE FACT THAT IT NOT ONLY FORMS A GOOD HALFWAY SUBJECT BETWEEN THE OSTRICH AND THE SINGINGBIRD BUT IN A WIDER SURVEY IT SERVES AS AN EXCELLENT STANDPOINT FROM WHICH TO LOOK BACKWARD TO THE FISH AND FORWARD TO THE HIGHER MAMMALIAN FORMS THE PRESENT PAPER IS MUCH MORE SPECIAL THAN THE LAST WHICH TREATED OF THE SKULL OF SEVERAL KINDS OF STRUTHIOUS BIRDS IN JUST AS MANY STAGES AS I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN THIS TIME AN ESSAY HAS BEEN MADE TO DESCRIBE STEP BY STEP THE WHOLE PROCESS OF GROWTH OF THE SKULL FACE AND SENSECAPSULES FROM THE FOURTH DAY OF INCUBATION TO EXTREME OLD AGE MY REASON FOR NOT DESCRIBING THE EARLIEST STAGES IS THAT I FIND IT DONE TO HAND ALREADY AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE REPEATEDLY VERIFIED THE OBSERVATIONS OF OTHER AUTHORS ON THE PRIMARY CONDITION OF THESE PARTS YET I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO ADD TO WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN THE LATEST AND BEST DESCRIPTION THAT I HAVE SEEN OF THE PRIMORDIAL CONDITION OF THE HEAD OF THE CHICK IS TO BE FOUND IN PROFESSOR HUXLEYS ELEMENTS OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY PP 136142 AND FIGS 57 AG MY STARTINGPOINT IS AT THAT STAGE WHICH IS THE LAST BUT ONE IN PROFESSOR HUXLEYS SERIESNAMELY FIGS 57 F AND F P 138 MY SECOND STAGE AGREES WITH HIS FIG 57 G IN DESCRIBING THE STRUTHIOUS SKULL I DID NOT DEPEND MERELY UPON WHAT AN EXAMINATION OF THOSE TYPES REVEALED BUT HAD ALREADY MADE A LARGE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS AND DRAWINGS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL IN VARIOUS FAMILIES OF BIRDS AND ALSO IN MANY TYPES FROM THE OTHER VERTEBRATE CLASSES IT WAS SHOWN ME HOWEVER BY MY MOST JUDICIOUS FRIEND PROFESSOR HUXLEY THAT MY WORK MISSED ITS END IN SOME DEGREE FROM ITS DIFFUSENESS AND THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET A PERFECT HISTORY OF ONE TYPE OF SKULL THAN AN IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF ANY NUMBER WHATEVER SO TO BE THOROUGH IT MUST CONTENT ME TO CULTIVATE A SMALL AND MODEST PLOT AT ONE TIME TRUSTING IN THE UNITY OF NATURE FOR THE VALUE OF THE RESULTS AND CONFIDENT THAT IF I CAN READ THE MEANING OF THE FOWLS SKULL MY EYES WILL BE OPENED TO SEE VERY MUCH MORE BELOW ABOVE AND AROUND  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1866 VOL CLVI PART 1 PP 113183 PLS 715 5A2MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND THERE WILL BE NOW A NECESSITY FOR SOME MODIFICATION OF THE NOMENCLATURE USED IN THE FORMER PAPER BOTH WITH REGARD TO THE TISSUES AND THE VARIOUS MORPHOLOGICAL REGIONS FOR IN BOTH THESE DEPARTMENTS OF MY WPRK I TRUST THERE HAS BEEN SOME EXTENSION OF KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS RECTIFICATION OF FORMER ERRORS THE OSSIFIC PROCESS THAN WHICH NOTHING IS MORE CONFUSING TO THE MORPHOLOGIST HAS OF LATE RECEIVED A MORE DEFINITE NOMENCLATURE SEE ON THE SHOULDERGIRDLE AND STERNUM RAY SOC 1868 P 4 THE NEW TERMS WILL BE USED HERE THESE ARE1  ECTOSTOSIS FOR THAT TRACT OF OSSEOUS DEPOSIT WHICH IS FORMED BETWEEN THE PERICHONDRIUM AND THE CARTILAGINOUS MASS 2 ENDOSTOSIS FOR THAT DEPOSIT WHICH TAKES PLACE PRIMARILY IN THE INTERCELLULAR SUBSTANCE OF HYALINE CARTILAGE OR BETWEEN THE CELLS OF SIMPLE CARTILAGE AND 3 PAROSTOSIS FOR ALL OSSIFICATIONS OF MERE FIBROUS TRACTS IN THE PAPER ON THE SHOULDERGIRDLE P 10 I HAVE SPOKEN OF A MODIFICATION OF THE GROWTHPROCESS IN THE WARMBLOODED CLASSES WHICH UNTIL FAIRLY UNDERSTOOD COST ME MUCH PERPLEXING THOUGHT THIS IS WHERE A PAROSTEAL PATCH OF BONY MATTER GRAFTS ITSELF UPON A CARTILAGINOUS PLATE SETTING UP FIRST AN ECTOSTEAL DEPOSIT CLOSE UPON THE CARTILAGEMASS AND THEN AN ENDOSTEAL PROCESS BETWEEN THE CELLS THEMSELVES IN THIS CASE WE HAVE THE COEXISTENCE OF THE THREE TYPES OF  OSTOSIS  TO FORM A SINGLE OSSEOUS CENTRE AND THIS STATE OF THINGS SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS SEEN IN THE COLDBLOODED CLASSES AND BY NO MEANS TO BE CON FOUNDED WITH AFTERCOALESCENCE MUST BE LOOKED UPON AS A VERY IMPORTANT METAMORPHIC MODIFICATION IN THE SKELETON OF THE HIGHER TYPES  AS FAR AS I CAN SEE AT PRESENT AN EXPLANATION OF THIS DELIQUESCENCE AS IT WERE OF THE HISTOLOGICAL PROCESS IN THE FORMATION OF BONE WILL GREATLY SMOOTH THE DIFFICULTIES THAT HAVE HITHERTO STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE HOMOLOGICAL PART OF THIS SCIENCE IT WILL THUS BE SEEN THAT NOTHING IS MORE UNSAFE THAN HASTY DECISION UPON REPRESENTATIVE PARTS IN THE VARIOUS TYPES THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE IN THE STUDY OF CARTILAGE WITH REGARD TO MORPHOLOGICAL REGIONS AND THEIR COMPARISON IN THE VARIOUS TYPES FOR IN SOME CASES DIFFERENTIATION AND CHONDRIFICATION ARE SYNCHRONOUS AND IN A SENSE SYNONYMOUS WHILST IN OTHERS THE FISSION OF THE CARTILAGE DOES NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL IT IS THOROUGHLY CONSISTENT AND EVEN DENSE THIS AFTERSPLITTING MAY BE PERFECT OR MORE OR LESS IMPERFECT IN THE LATTER CASE A CARTILAGINOUS PLATE BECOMES NOTCHED IN SOME INSTANCES AND FENESTRATE IN OTHERS SEE SHOULDERGIRDLE AND STERNUM P 4 BUT AS HYALINE CARTILAGE IS MERELY TO BE CONSIDERED A CONSOLIDATED PRIMORDIAL CELL MASS AND A VERY FASTGROWING TISSUE ALSO IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND IT RUNNING RIOT OVER A LARGE NUMBER OF MORPHOLOGICAL TERRITORIES OP CIT P 4 THIS TAKES PLACE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT IN THE LOWEST AND MOST GENERALIZED TYPES WHICH HOWEVER LARGE EVEN GIGANTIC THEY MAY BECOME ARE NEVERTHELESS MERE EMBRYOS THROUGHOUT LIFE IN RESPECT OF THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT THE SHARP DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SKULL AND THE VERTEBRAE IS WELL SEEN IN THISTHAT X IN THE AMPHIBIA NO DEFINITE LINE CAN BE DRAWN BETWEEN PARASTOSES AND ECTOSTOSES AND THE MOST TYPICAL ENDOSTEAL DEPOSIT IS MERELY AN OSSIFICATION OF THAT PART OF THE FIBROUS LAMINAE WHICH IMMEDIATELY ENESSES THE CARTILAGE 756DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL WHILST THE WHOLE OF THE NOTOCHORDAL REGION OF THE SKULL BELONGS TO THE OCCIPUT THIS REGION IF IT HAD SUFFERED FISSION WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO FORM A WHOLE SERIES OF VERTEBRAE THUS THAT CRANIAL REGION WHICH HAS MOST OF THE VERTEBRAL NATURE IN IT CANNOT ANSWER TO ONE ACTUAL VERTEBRAL SEGMENT SEEING THAT IT CONTAINS SUBJECTED TO THE LAW OF A NEW TYPE OF GROWTH SEVERAL POTENTIAL SEGMENTS AS THE SKULL PROPER CANNOT BE SHOWN TO CONFORM TO THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN SO NEITHER CAN THE FACIAL ARCHES BE PUT INTO THE SAME CATEGORY WITH THE RIBS FOR THE PRESENT THEY MUST WAIT UNTIL THEIR DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN WORKED OUT PERFECTLY IN A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF VERTEBRATE TYPES I MENTION THIS TO EXCUSE MYSELF FROM ALL CONTROVERSY CON CERNING THEM IN THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION THE MOUTH AND THE FAUCES THE FAUCIAL REGION IS OF GREAT EXTENT IN THE CYCLOSTOMOUS FISHES ARE HEDGED IN BY WHAT ARE EVIDENTLY ONE CLASS OF CARTILAGES THESE MAY BE EITHER FREE RODS OR FENESTRATE PLATES I PROPOSE TO CALL THESE THE FACIOFAUCIAL  SKELETON THESE BARS EXTEND BEYOND THE SKULL AND ARE VERY VARIABLY ATTACHED TO ITIN SOME OF THE LOWEST VERTEBRATES AS THE CYCLOSTOMI THE CHIMEROIDS AND THE LEPIDOSIREN BEING ANTERIORLY MERE OUTGROWTHS OF THE SKULL WHILST IN THE HIGHER CLASSES THEY HAVE A VERY INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT IN THE BIRD THERE ARE ONLY THREE POSTSTOMAL ARCHES DEVELOPED WHILST IN THE GILLBEARING  ICHTHYOPSIDA THERE ARE SEVERAL IT SEEMED TO ME TO BE NECESSARY TO PREFACE THE DESCRIPTION THAT IS TO FOLLOW WITH THESE REMARKS BUT I MUST NOW LET THE BIRDS HEAD TELL ITS OWN TALE WHAT THERE MAY BE IN THIS ACCOUNT WHICH WILL NOT HARMONIZE WITH THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN IN THE FORMER PAPER WILL BE DULY NOTED FROM TIME TO TIME AND THE REASONS FOR A MODIFIED NOMENCLATURE WILL BE GIVEN STRUCTURE OF THE CHICKS SKULL FIRST STAGEHEAD OF EMBRYO 3 LINES LONG 4TH DAY OF INCUBATION THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHICKS HEAD AND FACE ON

APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE STATE OF THINGS AT THIS EARLY STAGE FIG 1 HOWEVER THE LOWER VIEW IS SOMEWHAT DIAGRAMMATIC AS I HAVE IN IT ANTICIPATED THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PTERYGOPALATINE BAR PGPA FROM THE NEXT STAGE THESE SHOW THE PARTS AS MAGNIFIED 9 DIAMETERS THE VISCERAL CLEFTS PLATE LXXXI FIG 1 123 ARE STILL EVIDENT AND THE FRONTONASAL PROCESS FN IS AS YET FREE AT ITS SIDES SO THAT THE ANTERIOR

HAS BEEN SLICED COMPLETELY THROUGH HORIZONTALLY FIG 2 THE SECOND AND THIRD CEREBRAL VESICLES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY REMOVED AND THE FIRST VESICLE THE SUBDIVIDING RUDIMENT OF THE HEMISPHERES HAS HAD ITS UPPER HALF REMOVED THE LOWER HALF OF EACH EYEBALL IS SHOWN ALSO IN SITU 757MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND THE NOTOCHORD NC IS SEEN TO BE HALF THE LENGTH OF THE HEAD OR A LINE AND A HALF AND TO REACH WITHIN A VERY SLIGHT DISTANCE OF THE PITUITARY SPACE PTS THIS RELATIVE BUT NOT REAL RETREAT OF THE NOTOCHORD NOW BESPEAKS THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE POST PITUITARY PART OF THE BASISPHENOIDAL REGION THE NOTOCHORD IS CLUBBED AT ITS FORE END IT THEN IS NARROWER THEN THICKER BETWEEN THE AUDITORY SACS CL AND IS AGAIN SOMEWHAT DIMINISHED AS IT PASSES INTO THE ATLANTAL REGION THE BROAD THICK PLATE OF CARTILAGE SHOWN AS SOMEWHAT SLICED AWAY HORIZONTALLY ABOVE THE COCHLEAR CAVITIES CL IN THE FIGURE WHICH LIES RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE NOTOCHORD IS THE  INVESTING MASS  IV OF RATHKE AT THIS STAGE THE  INVESTING MASS  IS RAPIDLY PASSING FROM SIMPLE CARTILAGE INTO THE SOLID HYALINE VARIETY IT IS MOST DENSE NEAREST THE NOTOCHORD AND BECOMES MORE AND MORE GELATINOUS AS IT IS TRACED UPWARDS INTO THE WALL OF THE CRANIUM HENCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SPINAL CHORD IS NOT AS YET BRIDGED OVER BY A CARTILAGINOUS SUPEROCCIPITAL PLATE AND THE CARTILAGE IN WHICH THE UPPER PART OF THE AUDITORY SACS ARE IMBEDDED IS STILL IN A SOFT CONDITION HERE IT MAY BE AT ONCE REMARKED THAT NO SEPARATE CARTILAGINOUS AUDITORY CAPSULE IS FORMED IN THE CHICK SUCH AS CAN BE PLAINLY SEEN IN THE TADPOLE BUT THE TWO MOIETIES OF THE INVESTING MASS GROW INTO ONE CONTINUOUS  OCCIPITOOTIC  CARTILAGE T AT A SMALL DISTANCE IN FRONT OF THE COCHLEAR CAVITY CL THE INVESTING MASS IS SUDDENLY NARROWED THIS IS WHERE THE FIFTH NERVE PASSES OUT AND THIS NERVE DIVIDES THE OCCIPITOOTIC REGION FROM THE POSTERIOR SPHENOIDAL AT MOST THE CLUBBED ANTERIOR END OF THE NOTOCHORD IS WEDGED INTO THE VERY END OF THE BASISPHENOIDAL REGION AND AFTERWARDS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE WHOLE OF ITS CRANIAL PORTION BECOMES THE AXIS OF THE BASIOCCIPITAL ALL THE NERVES BETWEEN THE FIFTH CRANIAL AND THE FIRST SPINAL ARE RELATED TO THE INVESTING MASS SO THAT EVEN IF IT WERE CEDED THAT THE OCCIPITAL REGION IS ESSENTIALLY VERTEBRAL IN ITS NATURE YET IT MUST THEN BE LOOKED UPON NOT AS ONE SEGMENT BUT THE NONSEGMENTED COUNTERPART OF SEVERAL ON EACH SIDE OF THE END OF THE NOTOCHORD THE INVESTING MASS AT FIRST GROWS OUTWARDS IN AN ANGULAR MANNER SHOWN IN PROFESSOR HUXLEYS FIG 57 F AND IN PLATE LXXXI FIG 2 LG THESE ANGLES ARE THE RUDIMENTS OF THE CARTILAGINOUS  LINGULAE SPHENOIDALES THESE PARTS ARISE FROM THE ROOTS OF THE TRABECULCE4  RATHKES ACCOUNT OF THIS PART IN HIS WORK ON THE SNAKE ENTWICKELUNGSGESCHICHTE DER NATTER 1839 IS THOROUGHLY CORRECT I WILL GIVE IT AS TRANSLATED BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY CROON LECT P 56 AND ELEM COMP ANAT P 237 THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BASIS OF THE SKULL AND THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN IN THE EARLIEST EMBRYONIC CONDITION ARE 1 THAT ROUND THAT PART OF THE NOTOCHORD WHICH BELONGS TO THE HEAD MORE OF THE BLASTEMA THAT IS TO BE APPLIED IN THE SPINAL COLUMN TO THE FORMATION OF THE VERTEBRAE AND THEIR DIFFERENT LIGAMENTS IS AGGREGATED THAN AROUND THE REST OF ITS EXTENT AND 2 THAT THIS MASS GROWS OUT BEYOND THE NOTOCHORD TO FORM THE CRANIAL TRABECULM T THE PERIOTIC MASS WHICH BECOMES PERFECTLY SEGMENTED FROM THE OCCIPITAL SCLEROTOME IN MANY MAMMALS BUT IN THEM ONLY IN THE LAST OR OSSEOUS STAGE OF GROWTHIS NEVER CLOVEN IN ANY DEGREE FROM ITS SURROUNDINGS IN THE FOWL IT IS HOWEVER PARTIALLY CLOVEN OFF IN MANY WATERBIRDS BY A FENESTRA WHICH APPEARS BETWEEN THE EPIOTIC AND THE LOWER EDGE OF THE SUPEROCCIPITAL  I THINK THAT RATIIRES TERM MIDDLE TRABECULA MAY BE DROPPED IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE MERELY THE ELATINOUS PRECURSOR OF THE  POSTERIOR CLINOID WALL AND HAS NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE BASAL PAIRED TRABECULHE SEE HUXLEYS CROON LECT P 57 758DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL THE TRABECULAR ROOTS ARE TRANSVERSELY CRESTED THE SOMEWHAT DIAGRAMMATIC FIGURE 2 SHOWS THIS BUT FEEBLY THIS IS THE ANGLE OF THAT BEND FORMED BY THE EARLY SKULL CALLED THE CRANIAL FLEXURE  HUXLEY ELEM P 137 THIS CREST BECOMES VERY LARGE AND IS PERSISTENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE AFTERSTRAIGHTENING OF THE CRANIOFACIAL AXIS IT IS CONNECTED WITH THE HIGH  POSTERIOR CLINOID WALL THE ANTERIOR SMALLER MOIETY OF THE CRANIOFACIAL AXIS IS BENT FIRST AT AN ACUTE AND AFTERWARDS AT AN OBTUSE ANGLE IT IS BECOMING OBTUSE ON THE FOURTH DAY ALL THIS FORE PART IS FORMED BY THE  PAIRED TRABECULAE THESE ARE FLAT BANDS OF AT PRESENT SOFT OR SIMPLE CARTILAGE THEY ARE NOW ABOUT O OF AN INCH IN WIDTH AND ARE MODERATELY THICK IN PROPORTION THESE BANDS ARE GENTLY CURVED OUTWARDS AT FIRST TO ENCLOSE AN ELEGANTLY OVOIDAL MEMBRA NOUS SPACE THE PITUITARY SPACE PLATE LXXXI FIG 2 TR PTS THIS SPACE IS ENCLOSED BY THE EARLY COALESCENCE OF THE SYMMETRICAL BANDS IN FRONT OF IT AND THIS COALESCED PART IS NEARLY EQUAL IN LENGTH TO THE PITUITARY REGION THE TRABECULE MAINTAIN A SIMILAR SIZE TO THEIR EXTREMITIES BUT AT THEIR COALESCED PART THEY HAVE BEGUN TO FORM AN ARCHED OUTGROWTH ON EACH SDE  THESE SYMMETRICAL EXPANSIONS ARE THE RUDIMENTS OF THE  ALIETHMOIDAL AND ALISEPTAL CARTILAGES OF THE NASAL LABYRINTH THIS BROADENED ETHMOIDAL PART OF THE TRABECULE IS BENT BACKWARDS IN A ROUNDED MANNER ON ITSELF SO THAT THE REMAINING PART OF THE TRABECULHE LIES ON A LOWER PLANE PARALLEL WITH THE PITUITARY FLOOR AND WITH THE FREE ENDS LOOKING DIRECTLY BACKWARDS PLATE LXXXI FIG 1 CTR THE FREE ENDS ARE SLIGHTLY DIVERGENT AND ARE SEPARATED BY A SPACE ABOUT EQUAL TO THEIR OWN WIDTH THESE FREE RETRAL ENDS OF THE TRABECULE ARE THE TRABECULAR HORNS THEY FORM THE SOFT SKELETON OF THE  FRONTONASAL LAMINA FN AND ARE DEVELOPED INTO THE  ALE NASI OR ALINASAL LAMINA AND DO NOT COALESCE TO FORM THE INTERMAXILLARY AXIS OR  PRENASAL CARTILAGE AS I ONCE SUPPOSED SEE FORMER PAPER PP 121  122 THE  FRONTONASAL LAMINAE WILL HAVE UNITED WITH THE MAXILLARY RUDIMENT MR TO ENCLOSE THE ANTERIOR NARES N BEFORE THE  INTERMAXILLARY AXIS WILL BE EVIDENT THIS WILL BE DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT STAGE HERE ONE MAY PAUSE TO REMARK THAT THE NASAL LABYRINTH IS FORMED CONTINUOUSLY WITH THE PRIMORDIAL CRANIUM JUST AS IS THE CASE WITH THE OTIC CAP SULE ANY SEGMENTATION THAT MAY APPEAR AFTERWARDS WILL THUS BE A SECONDARY MORPHO LOGICAL PROCESS AND THUS THE EYEBALLS ARE SHARPLY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE OTHER SENSE CAPSULES WHICH FROM THEIR UNDEFINED SKELETAL GROWTH AND THEIR RELATIONS TO THE VISCERAL ARCHES FORM A MOST PUZZLING PROBLEM TO THE MORPHOLOGIST IT WILL BE SEEN FROM THIS DESCRIPTION THAT THE ANTERIOR SPHENOIDAL REGION IS SCARCELY AT ALL REPRESENTED AT THIS STAGE FOR THE SOMEWHAT NARROWED WAIST FORMED BY THE TRABECULAE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE PITUITARY BODY IS ALL THAT HAS YET APPEARED OF THE ANTERIOR CLINOIDS THE PREPITUITARY PART OF THE BASISPHENOID AND THE PRESPHENOID THIS LATTER PART IS INDEED FEEBLY REPRESENTED IN THE ADULT BIRD AND ONLY OCCUPIES AN ANGULAR SPACE ABOVE THE JUNCTION OF THE PERPENDICULAR ETHMOID WITH THE BASISPHENOID AT PRESENT THERE IS A CURVED CLUBBED SUBOCULAR BAR THE  MAXILLARY RUDIMENT  MR WHICH COMES VERY CLOSE AT ITS ANTERIOR CLUBBED END TO THE  FRONTONASAL LAMINA BUT HAS NOT YET UNITED WITH IT TO ENCLOSE THE ANTERIOR NARES N IN FIG 1 THE CARTILAGINOUS DIFFERENTIATION OF 759MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND THE PITH OF THIS BAR MY STUDY OF WHICH HAS BEEN FROM FINE TRANSVERSE SECTIONS IN THE NEXT STAGE IS SOMEWHAT ANTICIPATED THE AXIS OF THIS SOFT BAR IS CONVERTED INTO THE PALATAL AND PTERYGOID RODS PA PG AND FROM THE OUTER EDGE OF EACH OF THESE BENT CLUBS A LAMINA GROWS DOWNWARDS SEE HUXLEY OP CIT FIG 57 G 1 IN THE INTERNAL FIBROUS STROMA OF WHICH THE MAXILLARY AND JUGAL BONES ARE AFTERWARDS FORMED THE AXIS OF THE MAXILLARY RUDIMENT NEVER HAS ANY CARTILAGINOUS CONNEXION ANTERIORLY IN THE BIRD WITH THE ETHMOIDAL LAMINA PREFRONTAL AND BEHIND THE CHONDRIFICATION OF THE PTERYGOID PORTION OF THIS AXIS IS QUITE DISTINCT FROM AND MUCH LATER THAN THAT OF THE QUADRATE HERE WE SEE THAT THE SUBOCULAR ARCH IS MUCH MODIFIED FROM WHAT IS SEEN IN THE ICHTHYOPSIDA THE PRIMORDIAL SKULL FIGURED BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY FIG 57 F MUST HAVE BEEN FROM A LESS MATURE EMBRYO THAN THAT WHICH I AM HERE ILLUSTRATING AS MY FIRST STAGE FOR IN THAT FIGURE THE QUADRATE QU IS SHOWN AS CONTINUOUS WITH THE ANTEROEXTERNAL PART OF THE INVESTING MASS IN MY SPECIMEN PLATE LXXXI FIGS 1  2 U THE QUADRATE IS ALREADY A VERY DISTINCT TUBEROUS MASS OF CONSISTENT CARTILAGE RAPIDLY BECOMING HYALINE MECKELS CARTILAGE NK IS ALSO VERY DISTINCT AND SOLID AND ITS ARTICULAR END HAS A SINUOUS FACE ANSWERING TO THAT ON THE LOWER END OF THE QUADRATE WHILST THE POSTERIOR AND INTERNAL ANGULAR OUTGROWTHS HAVE ALREADY APPEARED FIG 1 MK THESE MECKELIAN RODS ARE VERY SHORT IN PROPORTION TO THEIR THICKNESS ARE GENTLY CURVED FORWARDS AND NEARLY MEET AT THE MID LINE BY ROUNDED ENDS THESE AXIAL PARTS OF THE FIRST PAIR OF POSTSTOMAL LAMINAE ARE SURROUNDED BY VERY DELICATE BLASTEMATHE PARENT TISSUE OF THE SPLINTS MUSCLES AND SKIN OF THE LOWER JAW THE OUTLINE OF THIS PRIMORDIAL MANDIBLE IS EMARGINATE AT THE MID LINE THAT WHICH IS PERHAPS THE MOST NOTEWORTHY IN THE FIRST POSTSTOMAL ARCH AT THIS STAGE IS ITS POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE AUDITORY CAPSULE ITS PIER THE QUADRATE IS SEG MENTED FROM THE ANTEROEXTERNAL ANGLE OF THE INVESTING MASS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE PERIOTIC CAPSULE AND OPPOSITE THE JUNCTION OF THE ANTERIOR WITH THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE CRANIAL PART OF THE NOTOCHORD WHILST THE FIFTH NERVE 5 PASSES OUT IN FRONT OF IT THIS NORMAL POSITION IS LOST AND THEN REGAINED BEFORE THE CHICK IS RIPE CLOSE BEHIND THE QUADRATE THERE IS THE FIRST POSTSTOMAL CLEFT 1 READY TO BECOME CONVERTED INTO THE COMPLEX TYMPANIC CAVITY IN THE OBTUSE ANGLE FORMED BY THE MECKELIAN RODS AND LYING ON A HIGHER PLANE THAN THOSE RODS WE FIND THE DISTAL ARRESTED CARTILAGES THAT BELONG TO THE SECOND POSTSTOMAL ARCH THESE ARE THE CERATO AND BASIHYALS PLATE LXXXI FIG 1 CH BH AT PRESENT THESE ARE MERELY THICKENED MASSES OF BLASTEMA THEIR OUTLINE BEING SOMEWHAT INDISTINCT AS THE YOUNG CELLS OF WHICH THEY ARE COMPOSED ARE NOT SHARPLY SEPARATED FROM THE FORMATIVE SUBSTANCE WHICH WILL BECOME THEIR PERICHONDRIAL INVESTMENT THE CERATO HYALS CH ARE EVEN NOW ONLY HALF THE SIZE OF THE MANDIBULAR RODS BUT THIS IS THE GREATEST RELATIVE SIZE THEY ATTAIN FOR THEY DIMINISH MUCH AFTERWARDS THERE IS NO PROPER SKELETAL SUBSTANCE BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE CERATOHYALS AND THE TISSUE THAT FORMS THE AUDITORY  COLUMELLA STAPES THIS LATTER PART IS NOT DIFFERENTIATED SUFFICIENTLY TO BE DESCRIBED AT PRESENT IT IS BOTH LATE IN APPEARANCE AND ALSO VERY MINUTE 760DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL THE BASIHYAL BH ALTHOUGH FORMED IN THE UNITED EDGES OF SYMMETRICAL LAMINAE IS EVEN AS A DEFINED MASS OF THICKENED BLASTEMA QUITE AZYGOUS IT IS TEARSHAPED THE NARROW END LYING BETWEEN THE LOWER ENDS OF THE CERATOHYALS THIS BASAL PART IS BETTER DEFINED THAN THE ARCHES AND CHONDRIFIES FIRST BEHIND THE SECOND FASTCLOSING CLEFT 2 THERE IS NOW TO BE SEEN A PAIR OF WELLDEFINED RODS NEARLY AS LARGE AS THE MECKELIAN CARTILAGES AND AS EARLY IN THEIR CHONDRIFICATION THESE ARE THE BRANCHIALS CBR ANSWERING TO THE FIRST BRANCHIAL ARCH OF THE ICHTHYOPSIDA THERE IS A LESS DISTINCT UPPER PIECE POINTED AND SMALL EBR AND A DELICATE STREAK OF ILLDEFINED BLASTEMA BEHIND AND BETWEEN BBR THIS LATTER IS FORMED INTO THE LONG SLENDER SOCALLED UROHYAL THE COUNTERPART OF THE  BASIBRANCHIAL BAND BEHIND THE BRANCHIAL ARCH A CHINK STILL INDICATES THE PLACE OF THE THIRD VISCERAL CLEFT 3 AT THIS EARLY STAGE THE ARCH OF THE TONGUE HAS BEGUN TO LIE WITHIN THE MANDIBULAR ARCH JUST AS THE LESSENED FIRST BRANCHIAL ARCH COMES TO LIE WITHIN THE MASSIVE HYOID ARCH IN THE OSSEOUS FISH ALREADY THE THIRD VISCERAL ARCH OF THE BIRD HAS OUTGROWN THE SECONDA STATE OF THINGS UNIVERSAL IN THE CLASS OF BIRDS BEFORE LEAVING THIS STAGE IT MAY BE NOTED AS INSTRUCTIVELY PARALLEL WITH THAT WHICH IS PERSISTENT IN CARTILAGINOUS FISHES THAT THERE IS NO EXOSKELETON NO PRAEMAXILLEE MAXILLSE DENTARIES ANGULARS OR THE LIKE THE MOUTH AND UNENCLOSED NOSTRILS ARE ENTIRELY BELOW THE HEAD THESE AND THE RUDIMENTARY TYMPANIC CAVITIES OPEN FREELY INTO EACH OTHER AND ARE ALL LINED WITH DERMAL TISSUE WHICH IS AS IT WERE TUCKED IN BETWEEN THE VISCERAL LAMINAE FROM THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE HEAD SECOND STAGEIHEAD OF EMBRYO FROM 4 TO 5 LINES LONG 5TH TO 7TH DAYS OF INCUBATION IN THE COURSE OF TWENTYFOUR HOURS GREAT CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE CHICKS SKULL AND FACE IN AN EMBRYO WITH A HEAD 4 LINES LONG PLATE LXXXI FIG 3 6 DIAM A VERTICAL SECTION SHOWS THE NOTOCHORDAL REGION TO BE SHORTER THAN THAT FORMED BY THE TRABECULE AND THIS ANTERIOR MOIETY OF THE CRANIOFACIAL AXIS HAS BECOME MUCH STRAIGHTER THE HEAD HAVING NOW TO A GREAT EXTENT RECOVERED FROM THE  CRANIAL FLEXURE THE  IN VESTING MASS HAS BECOME MORE SOLID AND A DISTINCT SWELLING ON EACH SIDE POSTERIORLY SHOWS HOW THE OCCIPITAL CONDYLE OC IS FORMEDVERY REPTILIAN HOWEVER IN SHAPE AT FIRST ON EACH SIDE A THIN SOFT LAMINA OF CARTILAGE EO IS GROWING UP BEHIND THE THIRD CEREBRAL VESICLE CV 3 THIS IS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE OCCIPITAL PLANE AT THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE BENDING OF THE PRIMORDIAL CRANIUM UPON ITSELF A TRANSVERSE CREST OF CARTILAGE HAS GROWN RAPIDLY UPWARDS AND BACKWARDS THIS THE POSTERIOR CLINOID WALL PROTECTS THE PITUITARY BODY BEHIND AND LIES IN THE MIDST OF A QUANTITY OF DELICATE STROMA WHICH  TILL LATELY I HAVE PARTLY FOLLOWED PROFESSOR OWENS

CARTILAGE HAS BECOME HIGH EVEN BELOW AND BETWEEN THE OPTIC NERVES 2 AND CLOSE IN FRONT OF THE PITUITARY BODY THE ANTERIOR CLINOID RIDGE ACL HAS COMMENCED BUT IN FRONT OF THE OPTIC NERVES THE GREATEST AND MOST SUDDEN CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE THE VERY SHORT BROAD WAIST BETWEEN THE PITUITARY SPACE AND THE RUDIMENTARY ETHMOIDAL ALAE SHOWN IN FIG 2 BEING AT THIS STAGE GREATLY ELONGATED AND ALTOGETHER DEVELOPED INTO A HIGH CREST THIS IS THE ETHMOPRE SPHENOIDAL PLATE PSP ETH THIS PLATE WHICH IS RAPIDLY PASSING INTO HYALINE CARTI LAGE IS SOMEWHAT HIGHER BEHIND THAN BEFORE IS NEARLY STRAIGHT ABOVE IS OBLIQUE BEHIND ABOVE THE OPTIC NERVES CONCAVE BELOW AND HAS A GENTLY CONVEX MARGIN IN FRONT THE ALAE OF THE NASAL LABYRINTH ARE NOT SHOWN IN THIS SECTION BUT ABOVE AND BELOW THE LINE WHERE THESE HAVE BEEN CUT AWAY ON THE LEFT SIDE TWO PROJECTIONS ARE SEEN THE UPPER OF THESE IS THE RETRAL SPIKE IN WHICH THE ETHMOID ENDS BEHIND ABOVE THE OLFACTORY CRURA WHILST THE LOWER PROCESS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE FACE IT BEING THE PRENASAL OR SNOUTCARTILAGE PN THIS PART WHICH IS THE ENDOSKELETAL AXIS OF THE PREMAXILLARY REGION GROWS AT FIRST BACKWARDS AS WELL AS

ETHMOPRESPHENOIDAL PLATE THE CORNUA THEMSELVES AS I HAVE ALREADY ASSERTED DEVELOPE THEMSELVES INTO THE ALE NASI THIS CON DITION OF THE PRENASAL CARTILAGE IS LIKE WHAT IS SEEN IN THE RIPE EMBRYO OF THE GREEN TURTLE CHELONE MYDAS IN THAT ANIMAL HOWEVER IT IS LESS ROUNDED IN SHAPE AND PROJECTS FURTHER DOWNWARDS FORMING A SOFT CORE TO THE PREMAXILLARIEST THE THICK ARCUATE INFERIOR EDGE OF THE ETHMOPRESPHENOIDAL PLATE HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO BE UNDERLAIN BY THAT FIBROUS STROMA WHICH AFTERWARDS THICKENS VERY MUCH BETWEEN THE BASIS CRANII AND PALATAL SKIN TO FORM A NIDUS FOR THE ROSTRAL PART OF THE  PARASPHENOID BELOW AND ON EACH SIDE OF THE BASIS CRANII THE MAXILLARY RUDIMENT HAS BEGUN TO SEND DOWNWARDS THE FACIAL LAMINA IN WHICH THE MAXILLARY AND JUGAL BONES ARE AFTERWARDS DE VELOPED AND TO HAVE A MORE DISTINCT ROD ON THE INNER SIDE WHICH BECOMES THE PALATINE PA AND THE PTERYGOID PG BUT THIS WILL BE BEST STUDIED IN A CHICK A DAY OR TWO  THIS SPIKE IS CALLED  CRISTA GALLI CRG IN MY FORMER PAPER BUT PROFESSOR HUXLEY HAS SHOWN ME RECENTLY THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BIRD WHICH ANSWERS TO THAT PLATE SAVE THAT NOTCHED AND GROOVED PART OF THE PERPENDICULAR ETHMOID WHICH LIES EXACTLY BETWEEN THE OLFACTORY NERVES SO THAT PRACTICALLY IT MAY BE SAID TO BE UNDEVELOPED IN THIS CLASS T PROFESSOR HUXLEY IS STRONGLY INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE  TRABECULE FROM THEIR ROOTS ARE IN REALITY THE FOREMOST AND OF NECESSITY THE INNERMOST PAIR OF VISCERAL ARCHES 762DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL OLDER I SHALL ALSO LEAVE THE MANDIBULAR MK AND HYOID CARTILAGES H FOR DESCRIPTION FROM AN OLDER EMBRYO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PARTS GOES ON VERY RAPIDLY SO THAT WHEN THE HEAD IS 5 LINES IN LENGTH A MUCH CLEARER IDEA OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE PARTS CAN BE OBTAINED A VERTICAL SECTION LEFTHAND OF THE SEPTUM OF SUCH A SKULL IS SHOWN IN PLATE LXXXI FIG 4 AND A SIDE VIEW IN FIG 5 BOTH MAGNIFIED 6 DIAMETERS IN THESE VIEWS THE CEREBRAL VESICLES ARE NOT FIGURED A LOW ORNITHIC TYPE SUCH AS IS PERSISTENT IN THE OSTRICH IS NOW ATTAINED I HAVE ALREADY HAD TO COMPARE THE SKULL OF THE CHICK WITH THAT OF A PLAGIOSTOME AND OF A TURTLE AFTER THE STRUTHIOUS STAGE HAS BEEN PASSED MANY OF THE HIGHER ORNITHIC SPE CIALIZATIONS WILL RAPIDLY APPEAR THE STRAIGHTENING OF THE CRANIOFACIAL AXIS HAS GONE ON SO AS TO MAKE THE FACE MUCH MORE PROGNATHOUS AND THE AXIS OF THE ANTERIOR PART OF THE FACE PN IS ESPECIALLY ALTERED SO AS TO HAVE ALREADY TAKEN ON AN ORNITHIC CHARACTER THE BOUNDARY ALSO BETWEEN THE NASAL AND ORBITAL REGIONS CAN NOW BE SEEN ONE LANDMARK HAS BECOME ESPECIALLY VISIBLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE DENSER CONDITION OF THE CARTILAGE THIS IS THE BRIDGE FOR THE NASAL NERVE NN IN THE ADULT BIRD THIS IS SEEN NEAR THE FREE POSTEROINFERIOR ANGLE OF THE NASAL SEPTUM FOR SOME DISTANCE BEHIND THIS BRIDGE THE CARTILAGE CONTINUES THICKER THAN WE FIND IT BETWEEN THE EYEBALLS THE LARGER THINNER POSTERIOR PART OF THE CRANIO FACIAL AXIS ANSWERS TO THE WHOLE OF THE PRESPHENOID AND THE POSTERIOR OR INTERORBITAL PART OF THE PERPENDICULAR ETHMOID THE GROOVES FOR THE OLFACTORY NERVE 1 CAN BE WELL SEEN AND THE RETRAL SPIKE OF THE ETHMOID SURMOUNTING THE NERVEGROOVES HAS BECOME MUCH MORE DEFINED AND HAS BEGUN TO TAKE A BACKWARD DIRECTION INSTEAD OF THE VERTICAL AND HUMAN DIRECTION IT HAD A DAY OR TWO BEFORE SEE PLATE LXXXI FIG 3 ETH THIS IS NOW THE HIGHEST PART OF THE CRANIOFACIAL AXIS WHEREAS THE PRESPHENOID WAS THE HIGHEST IN THE LAST EMBRYO THE WHOLE BASE OF THE PREPITUITARY PART OF THE PRIMORDIAL SKULL IS VERY THICK AND ROUNDED AND ITS THICKNESS FROM SIDE TO SIDE INCREASES IN THE PRENASAL CARTILAGE PN WHICH NOW SHOWS ITSELF TO BE A VERY FIT MODEL ON WHICH THE PREMAXIL LARIES OF ANY TYPE OF BIRD MIGHT BE FORMED IN NO BIRD WHATEVER LET THE SHAPE OF ITS FACE BE WHAT IT WILL IS THE TYPE OF THE FIRST MODEL OR PLATFORM WHOLLY LOST ALTHOUGH IN EVERY CASE THE PRIMORDIAL STRUCTURE INTO THE TYPE OF WHICH THEY WERE CAST AS IT WERE UNDERGOES VERY EARLY WASTING BETWEEN THE PALATAL SKIN BELOW AND THE STILL VERY ARCUATE SKULLBASE ABOVE A CONSIDERABLE MASS OF STROMA IS FORMED WHICH IS CORDIFORM IN SECTION AND WHICH SOON BECOMES THE SEAT OF THE ROSTRAL OR ANTERIOR

ITS CARTILAGINOUS STATE AS WELL AS IN ITS OSSIFIED CONDITION IN THE PAPER ON THE OSTRICHS SKULL P 127 ET SEQ THIS PART WAS DESCRIBED AS CONTINUOUS WITH THE REST OF THE NASAL LABYRINTH 764DEVELOPMENT

NARROW SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE THE ALISPHENOID AS SHOWS AN OBLIQUE CREST THIS IS THE POST FRONTAL PLATE PF IT IS LARGELY DEVELOPED IN FISHES BUT ENTIRELY ABSENT AS IS ALSO THE ALISPHENOID ITSELF IN THE LIZARDS AND CHELONIANS INFEROLATERALLY THE CARTILAGE OF THE AUDITORY REGION IS SCOOPED TO FORM THE TYMPANIC CAVITY BUT AT PRESENT THIS PART IS FILLED WITH A GELATINOUS STROMA WHICH GROWS VERY RAPIDLY

FIRST STAGE PLATE LXXXI FIGS 1  2 Q HAS GROWN INTO AN ARCHED BLUNTPOINTED  ORBITAL PROCESS INFERIORLY IT HAS BECOME A THICK BAR WITH TWO OBLIQUE CONDYLES FOR ARTICULATION WITH THE MANDIBLE WHILST POSTERIORLY IT HAS GROWN INTO A LONG ARCHED CRUS WHICH NOT ONLY ARTICULATES WITH THE PERIOTIC CAPSULE ABOVE THE JUNCTION OF THE PROOTIC AND OPISTHOTIC REGIONS BUT ALSO WITH THE EXOCCIPITAL IN FRONT OF THE ROOT OF ITS TYMPANIC WING THIS ARTICULATION IS SHOWN IN FIG 5A 16 DIAM AND FIG 5 6 DIAM AND IT IS SEEN TO ANSWER TO WHAT IS DEPICTED IN MY FORMER PAPER ON THE OSTRICHTRIBE PLATES VIIXIV IN THE TINAMOU PLATE XV FIG 1 Q SOME RECOVERY OF THE ORIGINAL POSITION IS ATTAINED  WHERE THE QUADRATE CARTILAGE ARTICULATES WITH THE CRANIUM THE SIDE WALL IS SOMEWHAT SCOOPED BUT FURTHER DOWN TWO SMALL CLEFTS APPEAR WHICH HOWEVER NEVER GO BEYOND THE CONDITION OF FENESTRNE THESE ARE THE FENESTRA OVALIS AND F ROTUNDA OR F VES TIBULI AND F COCHLEME THE FENESTRA OVALIS IS PROPERLY SPEAKING AN APERTURE IN THE FUNDUS OF THE CUPSHAPED ARTICULAR CAVITY IN WHICH THE HEAD OF THE STAPES PLATE LXXXI FIGS 5  5A ST IS ARTICULATED AND IS MORPHOLOGICALLY LIKE THE ACETABULAR FENESTRA OF THE BIRD AND THE GLENOID FENESTRA OF THE PROTEUS AND CRYPTOBRANCHUS SEE  SHOULDERGIRDLE AND STERNUM PL 3 FIGS 1  3 GL FROM THE FIRST THE PARTS OF THE HYOID ARCH ARE VERY INFERIOR IN SIZE AND LATER IN DEVE LOPMENT THAN THOSE OF THE MANDIBLE AT THIS STAGE AFTER THE QUADRATE HAS UNDERGONE SO MUCH MODIFICATION AND IS SO WELL CHONDRIFIED THE STAPES CAN ONLY NOW BE DISTINCTLY SEEN AND ITS OUTGROWTHS ARE MERE BUDLIKE PROJECTIONS FROM THE MAIN SHAFT IT IS SEEN THAT THE  I MUST INSIST ON THE ZOOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF THIS CONDITION OF THE QUADRATE WHICH IS TEMPORARY IN THE FOWL AND PERSISTENT IN THE STRUTHIONIDE IN A LARGE NUMBER OF BIRDS THE HEAD OF THE QUADRATE INSTEAD OF BEING SINGLE AS IN THE STRUTHIONIDE AND IN THIS EARLY STAGE OF THE FOWL IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SHORT CRURA ONE OF WHICH THE ANTEROEXTERNAL KEEPS ITS NORMAL PLACE ON THE PROOTIC WHILST THE POSTEROINTERNAL CRUS RETAINS THE ACQUIRED STRUTHIOUS RELATION WITH THE EXOCCIPITAL ALA THE PARROTS COME NEAREST TO THE FOWLS IN THE FORWARD POSITION OF BOTH THE ARTICULAR FACETS WHICH ARE SEPARATED BY A VERY NARROW TRACT IN BOTH THESE TYPES THE INNER IS SLIGHTLY BEHIND THE OUTER 765MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND HEAD OF THE QUADRATE PROJECTS SOME DISTANCE BEHIND THAT OF THE STAPES BUT THIS TRULY ORNITHIC MODIFICATION IS EXCEPTIONALLY ONLY OF SHORT DURATION IN THE FOWL AT PRESENT THE STAPES IS RELATIVELY A MUCH MORE MASSIVE BAR THAN AFTERWARDS SEEN FROM THE FRONT AND SIDE PLATE LXXXI FIGS 9  10 24 DIAM IT APPEARS AS A FLATTENED ROD CURVED FORWARDS WITH AN OVAL HEAD AND A TRILOBATE FLATTENED BASE THE LEADING RAY OF WHICH IS MOST CURVED FORWARDS AND OUTWARDS THERE IS STILL A CONSIDERABLE TRACT OF CARTILAGE TO BE DESCRIBED IN THE PROXIMAL PART OF THE FACE NAMELY THE PTERYGOPALATINE BAR THE PRENASAL CARTILAGE ALREADY DESCRIBED IS AN AZYGOUS PRESTOMAL COUNTERPART OF THE MECKELIAN RODS ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT BECOME CLOVEN FROM THE PRIMORDIAL SKULL AND IS NEVER RELATED TO A FREE PROXIMAL CARTILAGE LIKE THE MECKELIAN BARS BUT THE PTERYGOPALATINE BAR IS PERHAPS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE CEPHALIC SKELETON TO INTERPRET SEEING ITS PRIMORDIAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE SKULL IN THE CHICK AND NOTING ITS EARLY SUBDIVISION INTO A POSTERIOR SHORT AND AN ANTERIOR LONGER BAR IT SEEMS TO BE VERY FEASIBLE TO COMPARE ITS TWO DIVISIONS WITH THE QUADRATE AND THE MECKELIAN ROD IT LIES ABOVE AND IN FRONT OF THE GREAT STOMAL CLEFT MUCH AS THE MANDIBULAR RODS LIE BELOW AND BEHIND BUT ITS POINT OF SUSPENSION IS A GREAT DIFFICULTY AND THE MIND OF THE OBSERVER WILL REVERT TO ITS VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT IN THE ICHTHYOPSIDA IN THE CHIMAEROIDS AND IN THE LEPIDOSIREN THIS PART IS NOT ONLY CONTINUOUS WITH THE SKULLBASE BUT ALSO WITH THE PRENASAL CARTILAGE IN FRONT AND WITH THE COMMON PIER OF THE MANDIBULAR AND HYOID ARCHES MULLER MYXINOIDS PL

PTERYGOPALATINE BAR IS BELOW AND EXTERNAL TO THE BASIS CRANII FIGS 5  6 FROM WHICH IT IS SEPARATE FROM ITS FIRST DIFFERENTIATION IT HAS HOWEVER A MUCH MORE INTIMATE CONNEXION WITH THE QUADRATE BUT IS WELL DIFFERENTIATED FROM IT ON THE FOURTH DAY PLATE LXXXI FIG 1 PG G AND INDEED HAS VERY DIFFERENTHISTOLOGICAL CHARACTERS THE SUSPENSORIAL PARTS OF THE PTERYGOPALATINE BAR ARE FEEBLY DEVELOPED AND ARE LATE IN THEIR APPEARANCE THESE COME TO BE BELOW THE OPTIC FORAMEN FOR THE PTERYGOID AND BELOW THE PREFRONTAL PLATE FOR THE PALATINE THESE WILL BE DESCRIBED HEREAFTER AT PRESENT THE RELA TION OF THE PALATINE BAR TO THE PREFRONTAL PLATE FIG 6 PP PA IS TOTALLY UNLIKE WHAT IS SEEN IN THE FROG FOR BETWEEN THE TWO THERE IS NOT ONLY THE THICK FIBROUS STROMA IN WHICH THE DELICATE PALATINE BAR IS IMBEDDED BUT ALSO THE OPEN CHANNEL WHICH CONNECTS THE CAVITY OF THE MOUTH WITH THE INTERIOR OF THE NASAL LABYRINTH I WOULD MUCH RATHER INTERPRET THIS BAR BY ITS SPECIALIZED AND FREED CONDITION IN THE BIRD THAN BY WHAT IS SEEN IN THE LOW VERTEBRATE TYPES WHERE THE RAMPANT GROWTH OF CARTILAGE MASKS THE PROPER MORPHOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES AND YET EVEN IN THE HIGH TYPE THE BAR WOULD SEEM TO BEAR TWO INTERPRETATIONSNAMELY THAT IT MAY BE A SINGLE ARCH LIKE THE MANDIBULAR THE PTERYGOID BEING THE EQUIVALENT OF THE QUADRATE OR ON THE OTHER HAND THE PTERYGOID AND THE PALATINE MAY B E PROXIMAL PARTS OF TWO ARCHES NEITHER OF WHICH HAS  THIS BAR MUST BE STUDIED AT AN EARLIER STAGE IN CYCLODONT LIZARDS AND CHAMTCLEONS THE TRILOBATE HYOID PORTION IS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THE CLUBBED PERIOTIC ROD 766DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL A FREE DESCENDING RAY BUT I AM EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL ABOUT THE LATTER INTERPRETATION AND STRONGLY INCLINE TO REGARD THE MANDIBULAR PTERYGOPALATINE AND TRABECULAR RAYS AS TRUE SERIAL COUNTERPARTS THE TRUE HISTOLOGICAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PTERYGOPALATINE BAR HAS COST ME MUCH LABOUR ONLY BY EXAMINING SECTIONS MADE AT MANY STAGES AND BY SEEING THESE UNDER VERY HIGH POWERS HAS THE MEANING BEEN MADE APPARENT IN A FRESHMADE SECTION AT THIS STAGE PLATE LXXXI FIG 6 THE TISSUES COMPOSING THE ETHMOID ETH THE ROSTRUM RST THE PALATINE PA AND THE SCLEROTIC SCL DO NOT APPEAR VERY MUCH UNLIKE WHEN SEEN BY LOW POWERS AFTERWARDS THEIR DIFFERING CHARACTERS MAY BE SEEN THE CELLS COM POSING THE SCLEROTIC SCL ARE SMALLER THAN THOSE WHICH MAKE UP THE ETHMOID ETH BUT THEY RAPIDLY FORM HYALINE CARTILAGE AND BOTH THESE TRACTS ARE MORE TRANSLUCENT THAN THE ROSTRAL STROMA OR THE CELLS COMPOSING THE PALATINE THE LATTER CAN HOWEVER BE SEEN TO TRANSMIT THE LIGHT BETTER THAN THE ROSTRAL MASS AND BY THE USE OF HIGH POWERS 320 DIAM THE STRUCTURE OF THE ROD BECOMES SHARPLY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE NASCENT CELLULAR TISSUE IN WHICH IT IS IMBEDDED AND ALSO FROM THE MORE ADVANCED CONNECTIVETISSUE CELLS OF THE ROSTRUM MUCH THE GREATER PART OF THE PALATINE BAR FIG 11 IS COMPOSED OF DELICATE SHARPENDED FUSIFORM CELLS OF SIMPLE CARTILAGE HAVING LARGE GRANULAR NUCLEI BUT THE PITH OF THE BAR IS COMPOSED OF STILL MORE DELICATE AND SMALLER CELLS HAVING AN OVAL FORM AND WITHOUT APPARENT NUCLEIAT LEAST AS SEEN MAGNIFIED 320 DIAMETERS IT IS THIS PITH WHICH IS THE FIRST TO OSSIFY AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SIMPLE CARTILAGE INTO BONE IS SO RAPID AS TO GIVE THE DEPOSIT THE APPEARANCE OF A MEMBRANE BONET THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE PALATINE BAR WILL BE DESCRIBED HEREAFTER AND THE PTERYGOID PG WHICH IS AT PRESENT COMPOSED OF SIMPLE CARTILAGE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PALATINE REGION WILL BE CONSIDERED AT THE SAME TIME THERE NOW REMAIN FOR DESCRIPTION THE FREE PART OF THE FACIAL POSTSTOMAL ARCHES AND THE KEYSTONES THAT COMPLETE THEM THERE IS NO KEYSTONE TO THE MANDIBULAR ARCH WHICH  PROFESSOR HUXLEY IS DISPOSED TO LOOK UPON WHAT I CALL SIMPLE CARTILAGE AS MERELY  INDIFFERENT TISSUE T FOR MANY YEARS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PTERYGOPALATINE BAR IN THE SAUROPSIDA AND MAMMALIA HAS BEEN A GREAT DIFFICULTY TO ME AS WITH MODERATELY HIGH POWERS AT STAGES MORE ADVANCED THAN THE ONE UNDER NOTICE I COULD NOT WELL SEE HOW THE MAIN PART OF THE BAR DIFFERED FROM A MEMBRANE BONE YET I HAD DISCOVERED THE EXISTENCE OF HYALINE CARTILAGE IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BAR IN BIRDS IN THE PASSERINME AND SOME OTHERS THE BROAD TRANSPALATINE ANGLE IS NOT OSSIFIED BY THE PROPER PALATINE CENTRE BUT BY A SEPARATE ENDOSTEAL DEPOSIT AND THAT LONG AFTER THE MAIN BAR SO THAT THE SIMPLE CARTILAGE GAINS TIME FOR A PLENTIFUL INTERCELLULAR DEPOSIT IN THE WOODPECKER PICUS VIRIDIS THE INNER EDGE OF EACH PALATINE DOES NOT OSSIFY FROM THE MAIN BONY ROD BUT DEVELOPES INTO HYALINE CARTILAGE COALESCES WITH ITS COUNTERPART OF THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN SLOWLY AND FEEBLY OSSIFIES BY ENDOSTOSIS THIS CENTRE BEING PROPERLY SPEAKING AN AZYGOUS C MESOPTERYGOID HYALINE CARTILAGE MAY BE FOUND AT THE PTERYGOID END OF THE PALATINE PROPER IN CERTAIN BIRDS E G CAPRIMULGUS THEN IT ALSO APPEARS IN THE COUNTERPART FACET IN THE PTERYGOID IT IS ALWAYS PRESENT ON THE QUADRATE END OF THE PTERYGOID AND WHENEVER THIS BONE ARTICULATES WITH A BASIPTERYGOID PROCESS A MENISCOID PLATE IS DEVELOPED ON THE CORRE SPONDING PART OF THE PTERYGOID IN MANY REPTILES LACERTIANS AND CHELONIANS THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE SUB OCULAR CARTILAGE CHONDRIFIES AND DEVELOPES INTO A STRAIGHT ROD WHICH IS OBLIQUELY SITUATED ABOVE THE FIBROUS OR MAIN PTERYGOID  OSSIFYING SEPARATELY IT BECOMES

INTERNAL IAP AND POSTERIOR PAP ANGULAR PROCESSES ALREADY THESE PROCESSES SHOW THE TYPE TO WHICH THE BIRD BELONGS FOR THEY HAVE A PECULIAR DEVELOPMENT IN THE WHOLE GALLOANSERINE  SERIES AND IN ONE OR TWO MIXED COGNATE FORMS FOR INSTANCE IN THE FLAMINGO THEY ATTAIN THEIR MOST EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT IN THE  TETRAONINE  SUB GROUP OF THE GALLINA AND ESPECIALLY IN TETRAO UTROGALLZS IN A SOMEWHAT

STRUTHIOUS BIRDS SEE FORMER PAPER PLATES IIXIV AND THE ENDS OF THESE SHORT PROCESSES ARE VERY KNOBBED IN THIS INSTANCE THE NASCENT CONNECTIVE FIBRES SURROUNDING THESE PARTS WERE QUITE FREE FROM OSSEOUS DEPOSIT AND SO WAS THE REST OF THE PRIMORDIAL SKULL NOW REPRESENTING THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES BUT IN ONE A DAY OR SO OLDER THE SPLINTBONES HAD COMMENCED OUTSIDE THE PERICHONDRIUM OF THE

OSTRICH PLATE 17 FIGS 5  6 PCR IS CONTINUOUS WITH THE REST OF  HERE LET IT BE REMARKED THAT MY DESCRIPTION OF THE BASE OF THE SKULL WILL DIFFER CONSIDERABLY FROM THAT GIVEN IN THE OSTRICHPAPER I HAVE NOW FOUND THAT THE  ROSTRUM  IS NOT PREFORMED IN CARTILAGE THAT THE PITUITARY FLOOR IS NEVER FILLED IN BY CARTILAGE THAT THE BASITEMPORALS ARE AT FIRST SPLINTBONES AND AFTERWARDS ECTOSTEAL PLATES THAT THEREFORE THEY DO NOT PERFECTLY CORRESPOND WITH THE SYMMETRICAL BASISPHENOIDS OF THE LIZARD AND LASTLY THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFERENT MODES IN WHICH THEY RECEIVE OSSIFIC MATTER THE BASI PTERYGOID

SPHENOIDALES  OF THE HUMAN EMBRYO THEY RECEIVE THEIR OSSEOUS DEPOSIT FROM ANOTHER SOURCE NAMELY FROM THE AZYGOUS PARA SPHENOIDAL PIECE BUT TO INTERPRET THE PRIMORDIAL SKELETON BY THE AFTERDEPOSITS OF BONE IS TO STUDY THE MASK AND NOT THE FACE BEHIND THE PITUITARY SPACE THE BASE OF THE SKULL IN ITS THICK PART FORMS A VERY NARROW WAIST AND THE MOIETIES OF THIS PINCHED PART ARE ALSO CONTRACTED AT

PARTS IN THE LOWER MAAMMALIA WITH THOSE OF MAN I FEEL SATISFIED THAT THE BONY LINGULA IN THAT CLASS ANSWER TO THE  BASITEMPORAL RUDIMENTS OF THE  PARASPHENOID 770DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON

STRONGLY INVEIGHED AGAINST SINCE BY PROFESSOR HTXLEY AT PAGE 113 I SPOKE OF THESE AS THE DISTINCT COUNTERPARTS OF THE PALATINE PLATE OF THE MAMMALIAN MAXILLARY I SHALL HENCEFORTH DROP THE TERM  PREVOMER AND CALL THE LACERTIAN BONE THE SOCALLED TURBINAL  SEPTOMAXILLARY THE BONE DESCRIBED AS THE MAXILLARY IN MY FORMER PAPER PLATE XI FIG 1 PLATE XIII FIGS 12  13 MX P 141 MAY BE CALLED THE  POSTMAXILLARY  THE FOWL DOES NOT POSSESS IT I AM NLOW SATISFIED THAT ALTHOUGH MANY BIRDS HAVE THE ADDITIONAL LACERTIAN BONE TRULY REPRESENTED BY MAXILLARY OUTGROWTHS YET THESE HAVE NO EXISTENCE IN THE GALLINACEAE AND IN NO BIRD IS THERE A DISTINCT SEPTOMAXILLARY THE COUNTERPART OF THE EXCEPTIONAL  POSTMAXILLARY  O THE BIRD MUST BE SOUGHT FOR FAR DOWN AMONGST THE GANOID FISHES 773MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND MY DESCRIPTION OF THESE PARTS WILL DIFFER CONSIDERABLY FROM THAT GIVEN IN MY FORMER PAPER AS IN MY EARLIER OBSERVATIONS I HAD MISTAKEN THE CELLULAR TISSUE COMPOSING THE  ROSTRUM  FOR SIMPLE CARTILAGE AND THE TWO PAROSTEAL TRACTS BEHIND IT THE BASITEM PORALS FOR ECTOSTEAL PLATES THE LAYER OF CARTILAGE ALSO WHICH I SUPPOSED  STRUTHIOUS SKULL P 117 TO FORM A FLOOR TO THE PITUITARY SPACE HAS NO EXISTENCE IN THE BIRD PROFESSOR HUXLEY OP CIT P 170 FIRST SHOWED THAT THE SOCALLED  BASIPRESPHENOID OF OSSEOUS FISHES IS NOTHING BUT A MEMBRANE BONE IN THEM AND IN THE AMPHIBIA A THICK TRACT OF CPALATOFATUCIAL SUBCUTANEOUS FIBROUS TISSUE IS CONVERTED INTO A LARGE BEAM OF BONE WHICH RUNS FORWARDS BENEATH THE NASAL REGION ANTERIORLY AND BACKWARDS BELOW THE TEMPORAL REGION BEHIND THIS BONE IS WELL DEVELOPED IN THE ANMPHIBIA HUXLEY OP CIT P 214 FIG 86 B X AND ITS POSTERIOR OR TEMPORAL WINGS ARE OUTSPREAD WHEREAS IN THE FISH THEY ARE OFTEN TURNED VERY SHARPLY UPWARDS IN THE CHICK IN THE NEXT STAGE TO BE DESCRIBED THERE IS EXACTLY SUCH A TRACT OF BONE BUT IT HAS FORMED STRONG BONY ATTACHMENTS TO THE TRUE SKULLBASE AT PRESENT THIS CONNEXION HAS BEGUN BUT IT IS SLIGHT AND EASILY DETACHED BUT BESIDES THIS THE OSSEOUS MATTER IS IN THREE SEPARATE TERRITORIES INSTEAD OF BEING ONE CONTINUOUS SHEET AS IN THE FISH AND FROG THE ANTERIOR NARROW OSSICLE THE  ROSTRUM IS STYLOID IT IS FORMED BY THE CONVERSION INTO BONE OF THE ROSTRAL STROMA FIGURED IN PLATE LXXXI FIGS 6  7 RST POSTERIORLY OSSEOUS MATTER HAS RUN FROIN IT INTO THE LOWER EDGE OF THE WALLS OF THE PITUITARY SPACE HERE THE INNERMOST PART OF A PAROSTEAL TRACT HAS BECOME THE ECTOSTEAL LAYER TO THE CARTI LAGE AND PAROSTOSES ECTOSTOSES AND ENDOSTOSES ALL RUN INTO EACH OTHER THE FIRST BEING THE  CUE  TO THE SECOND AND THIRD THIS I CALL THE GRAFTING OF AN EXOSKELETCA SPLINT BONE ULPON AN ENDOSKCELETAL REGION THE OSSEOUS DEPOSIT SO FAR FORTH AS IT HAS IMMEDIATE RELATION TO THE CARTILAGE OF THE PITUITARY REGION FORMS

SURFACE FIG 3 IT IS SHOWN HOW THE BONY MATTER CREEPS ROUND AND INTO THE TRABECULAR ROOT THE REST OF THE BASIS CRANII IS QUITE SEPARABLE FROM THE THICK SUBCUTANEOUS FLOOR AND THE BREADTH SUDDENLY EXPANDS BEHIND THE PITUITARY REGION SO ALSO THE FAUCIAL PORTION OF THE FIBROUS MAT IS OF GREAT BREADTH FIG 2 BT IN SHAPE THIS LAYER IS LIKE THE LEAF OF A BAUHINIA THE  ROSTRUM  ANSWERING TO THE LEAFSTALK THE POSTERIOR MARGIN OF THE BILOBATE MASS IS EXAGGERATED AS TO DISTINCTNESS IN THE FIGURE BUT IN REALITY THE WEB THINS OUT RAPIDLY IN FRONT OF THE EXIT OF THE VAGUS NERVES 8 THIS SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE THICKNESS OF THE CRANIAL FLOOR IS VERY REMARKABLE EVEN IN THE ADULT BIRD TWO LARGE TRACTS OF OSSEOUS DEPOSIT THE BASITEMPORALS HAVING A SOMEWHAT RENIFORM OUTLINE HAVE ALREADY APPEARED IN THIS THICK FIBROUS WEB FIG 2 BT THEY ARE ELEGANTLY  IN CERTAIN OSSEOUS FISHES FOR EXAMPLE THE PERCH PIKE GURNARD C THE PREPITUITARY PORTION OF THE BASI SPHENOIDAL CARTILAGE IS INVESTED BY A DELICATE ECTOSTEAL SHEATH THIS AZYGOUS BASISPHENOID IS THUS CONFINED TO THE FRONT OF THE PITUITARY SPACE THROULGH THE REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROOTIC FLOOR WHICH TAKES UP SO MUCH OF THE INVESTING MASS ANTERIORLY 774DEVELOPMENT OTE S OF TOF THE KULCOMMBON FOWL CORALLIKE IN APPEARANCE AND A ROW OF FEEBLE OSSELETS LYING ALONG THE GROOVED MID LINE ARE READY IN A FEW HOURSTO CONNECT TOGETHER THE WHOLE BASITEMPORAL TRACT NOT ONLY DO THESE SYMMETRICAL PLATES RAPIDLY COALESCE BUT THE  ROSTRUM ALSO WILL HAVE UNITED WITH THEM BY THE TIME THEY HAVE MELTED INTO EACH OTHER THEN THE  PARASPHENOID OF THE ICHTHYOPSIDAN WILL BE FULLY REPRESENTED AND THE OPEN PITUITARY SPACE WILL BE FILLED IN BELOW BY THE EXTRANEOUS PLATE IT CANNOT BE VOID OF INTEREST THAT THE ORNITHIC EMBRYO IS THUS SEEN TO ARRIVE AT ITS FURTHER GOAL BY PASSING AT FIRST ALONG ICHTHYOPSIDAN PATHS  NOT ONLY IS THIS SEEN IN THE SKULLBASE BUT ALSO IN ALL THE OUTWORKS OF THE FACE THE ANTERIOR TERMINATION OF THE ROSTRUM IS VERY THIN IT LIES IN THE MIDST OF A LARGE MASS OF STROMA PLATE LXXXII FIG 7 RBS UNDERLYING THE PERPENDICULAR ETH MOID ETH AND ABOVE AND BETWEEN THE LAMINAR PALATINES PA THIS SECTION SHOWS WELL HOW THOROUGH THE AMALGAMATION OF THE TRABECULE BECOMES CONJIJGATION OF SYMMETRICAL BANDS OF SIMPLE CARTILAGE AT THE MID LINE IS A FREQUENT PHENOMENON IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKELETON WHERE THE MOIETIES OF THE INVESTING MASS  EMBRACE THE PITUITARY BODY AND THUS BECOME TRABECULE ALL THE PRENOTOCHORDAL PART OF THE EARLY SKULLBASE IS TRABECULAR THERE THE CARTILAGE GROWS UPWARDS INTO THE ALISPHENOID PLATE

THIS WILL BE SEEN AT ONCE IF THE FIGURES IN PLATE LXXXII ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE IN PLATE LXXXIII ALL THE FIGURES IN PLATE LXXXIII AND FIGS 812 IN PLATE LXXXII ARE FROM A CHICK AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE THIRD WEEK OF INCUBATION THE HEAD BEING AN INCH IN LENGTH OR ONETHIRD LARGER THAN THAT FROM WHICH THE FIGURES 1 TO 7 IN PLATE LXXXII ARE GIVEN THIS STAGE HOWEVER WILL BE DRAWN NEARER TO THE LAST BY SHOWING THE STRUCTURE OF SOME YOUNGER EMBRYOS THE BASAL VIEW OF THE SKULL CANNOT BE SHOWN AS MERELY PRIMORDIAL SO THAT FIG 1 IN PLATE LXXXIII MUST BE COMPARED WITH FIGS 1  2 IN PLATE LXXXII IN THIS LATTER PLATE THE INNER VIEW OF THE SKULLFLOOR IS ONLY PARTIALLY GIVEN WHILST IN PLATE LXXXIII FIG 2 I AM ABLE TO SHOW THE ENTIRE PRIMORDIAL SKULL FROM ABOVE THE GRAFTED SPLINTS BELOW NOT BEING FOCUSED BUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BE NOTICED AND WHICH WAS COMMENCING BUT NOT DESCRIBED IN THE THIRD STAGE MAKES IT PROFITABLE TO COMPARE THE SECOND WITH THE FOURTH WE SAW THAT IN THE SECOND STAGE PLATE LXXXI FIGS 4  5 THE CRANIOFACIAL AXIS HAD ATTAINED TO A STRUTHIOUS CONDITION IN PLATE LXXXIII FIG 4 THIS PART IS SEEN TO BE RAPIDLY PASSING INTO THE TINAMINE STAGE THE REGION COMMON TO THE

HIGHER ARBOREAL TYPES THE VERTICAL ORBITONASAL SEPTUM HAS UNDERGONE FISSION BETWEEN THE EYES AS WELL AS BETWEEN THE OLFACTORY SACS A CONSIDERABLE SERIES OF THESE CLEFTS APPEAR IN THIS PLATE IN SOME BIRDS ALL AFTER ONE FASHION BUT IN THE FOWL THERE ARE ONLY TWO AND IN THE STRUTHIONIDAE ONLY ONE THIS POSTERIOR CLEFT DIVIDES THE ETHMOID ETH FROM THE PRE SPHENOID PS THIS LATTER REGION IS VERY FEEBLY DEVELOPED FOR THE FENESTRATE CLEFT ENDS BELOW AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE BASE AND THE ETHMOIDAL AND BASISPHENOIDAL REGIONS MEET BELOW IT THE BAR WHICH ENCLOSES THE ANTERIOR CLEFT BELOW IS VERY INSTRUCTIVE IT IS AT PRESENT OF CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS PLATE LXXXIII FIG 2 SV ALTHOUGH IT IS ABSORBED IN A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS PERIOD IT IS ALATE AND I PROPOSE TO CALL THE ALAR OUTGROWTHS THE SUPERVOMERINE LAMINAE TO CONNECT THEM WITH THEIR PERSISTENT AND MORE LARGELY DEVELOPED COUNTERPARTS IN THE FROG AND THE CROCODILE THEY HAVE THEIR LARGEST DEVE LOPMENT BEHIND SEE PLATE LXXXII FIG 11

RETIRED FAR FROM THE MID LINE THIS STATE OF THINGS COMBINED WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE INVESTING MASS AND THE ARREST OF THE NOTOCHORD HAS CAUSED THE POSTERIOR BASICRANIAL FONTANELLE PBF TO BECOME A

WERE MORE DISTINCT ON ACCOUNT OF THE ARRESTED GROWTH OF THE CHICKENS AT ANY RATE THEY ARE VERY INSTRUCTIVE AND THE FOWL IS THUS SEEN TO AGREE WITH THE OSSEOUS FISH AND WITH MANY FAMILIES OF ITS OWN CLASS IN THE SEPARATE FORMATION OF THESE BONES IN MY FORMER PAPER P 129 I STATED THAT THE POST FRONTAL OF THE BIRD IS AN ICHTHYIC BONE THE SOCALLED POSTFRONTAL OF THE LIZARD BEING A POSTORBITAL

ABOVE BETWEEN THE ROOFBONES AND THE NARROW SYNCHONDROSIAL TRACTS IN THE PRIMORDIAL SKULL MAKE THIS A VERY FITTING STAGE FOR COMPARISON WITH THE SKULL OF A REPTILE THE NOTOCHORD IS NOW FAIRLY VANISHED

HUGE ORBITOSPHENOIDS OF THE LIZARD BUT AS THERE ARE NO CARTILAGINOUS ALAE MINORES THE ECTOSTEAL PLATE DEGENERATES INTO A THICKISH  PAROSTOSIS AND THEN GRAFTS ITSELF UPON THE INDISTINCT ORBITOSPHENOIDAL LIPS OF THE PRESPHENOID THE ADDI TIONAL PAIR ARE VERY COMMON IN BIRDS AND I HAVE MENTIONED THE EXISTENCE OF TWO CENTRES IN THE EMU IN MY FORMER PAPER P 137 WHERE THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS

AFTERWARDS THEY SET UP OSSIFICATION IN IT IF THE NARROWEST PART OF THE TRACT OF CARTILAGE ABOVE THE INTERORBITAL FENESTRA WERE QUITE ASBORBED IT WOULD THEN BE PLAINLY SEEN WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THE TRUE MOR PHOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES OF THE PERPENDICULAR ETHMOID PE ETH THIS DOES TAKE PLACE IN SOME BIRDS AS IN THE CORMORANT THE SUNBITTERN AND THE STILTPLOVER AND THEN THE CLEFT ALSO RUNS ACROSS TO THE COMMON OPTIC FORAMEN SO THAT THE SMALL PRESPHENOID IS COMPLETELY SEVERED FROM THE ETHMOBASISPHENOIDAL BAND BELOW IN THE BIRD THE PRE SPHENOID IS TO BE REGARDED AS A WEDGE WITH ITS SHARP END BELOW CLEAVING THE BASAL REGION WHERE THE BASISPHENOID AND VERTICAL ETHMOID MEET THIS IS A REMARKABLE MODIFI CATION OF THE VERTEBRATE SKULL THE FRONTAL AND PERPENDICULAR REGIONS OF THE ETHMOID ARE NOT

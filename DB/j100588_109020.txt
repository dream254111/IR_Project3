Development of the Skull of the Common Fovwl Gallus domesticus By WILLIAM KITCHEN PARKER FRS Received November 25 1868Read February 11 1869 Introductory Remarks IN my former paper which treated of the structure and development of the skull in the Ostrichtribe I proposed to write a series of such papers on the skull of the Verte brata and that the first of these should be confined to that of the Common Fowl This Bird is selected for several reasons the first of which is the readiness with which it may be obtained but as far as science is concerned a still more important reason lies in the fact that it not only forms a good halfway subject between the Ostrich and the Singingbird but in a wider survey it serves as an excellent standpoint from which to look backward to the Fish and forward to the higher Mammalian forms The present paper is much more special than the last which treated of the skull of several kinds of Struthious Birds in just as many stages as I was able to obtain this time an essay has been made to describe step by step the whole process of growth of the skull face and sensecapsules from the fourth day of incubation to extreme old age My reason for not describing the earliest stages is that I find it done to hand already and although I have repeatedly verified the observations of other authors on the primary condition of these parts yet I have nothing more to add to what is already known The latest and best description that I have seen of the primordial condition of the head of the chick is to be found in Professor HUXLEYS Elements of Comparative Anatomy pp 136142 and figs 57 AG My startingpoint is at that stage which is the last but one in Professor HUXLEYS seriesnamely figs 57 F and F p 138 my second stage agrees with his fig 57 G In describing the Struthious skull I did not depend merely upon what an examination of those types revealed but had already made a large number of observations and drawings on the development of the skull in various Families of Birds and also in many types from the other Vertebrate Classes It was shown me however by my most judicious friend Professor HUXLEY that my work missed its end in some degree from its diffuseness and that it would be better to get a perfect history of one type of skull than an imperfect knowledge of any number whatever So to be thorough it must content me to cultivate a small and modest plot at one time trusting in the Unity of Nature for the value of the results and confident that if I can read the meaning of the Fowls skull my eyes will be opened to see very much more below above and around  Philosophical Transactions 1866 vol clvi part 1 pp 113183 pls 715 5a2MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND There will be now a necessity for some modification of the nomenclature used in the former paper both with regard to the tissues and the various morphological regions for in both these departments of my wprk I trust there has been some extension of knowledge as well as rectification of former errors The ossific process than which nothing is more confusing to the morphologist has of late received a more definite nomenclature see On the Shouldergirdle and Sternum Ray Soc 1868 p 4 the new terms will be used here These are1  ectostosis for that tract of osseous deposit which is formed between the perichondrium and the cartilaginous mass 2 endostosis for that deposit which takes place primarily in the intercellular substance of hyaline cartilage or between the cells of simple cartilage and 3 parostosis for all ossifications of mere fibrous tracts In the paper On the Shouldergirdle p 10 I have spoken of a modification of the growthprocess in the Warmblooded Classes which until fairly understood cost me much perplexing thought this is where a parosteal patch of bony matter grafts itself upon a cartilaginous plate setting up first an ectosteal deposit close upon the cartilagemass and then an endosteal process between the cells themselves In this case we have the coexistence of the three types of  ostosis  to form a single osseous centre and this state of things so different from what is seen in the Coldblooded Classes and by no means to be con founded with aftercoalescence must be looked upon as a very important metamorphic modification in the skeleton of the higher types  As far as I can see at present an explanation of this deliquescence as it were of the histological process in the formation of bone will greatly smooth the difficulties that have hitherto stood in the way of the homological part of this science it will thus be seen that nothing is more unsafe than hasty decision upon representative parts in the various types There is much to be done in the study of cartilage with regard to morphological regions and their comparison in the various types for in some cases differentiation and chondrification are synchronous and in a sense synonymous whilst in others the fission of the cartilage does not take place until it is thoroughly consistent and even dense This aftersplitting may be perfect or more or less imperfect in the latter case a cartilaginous plate becomes notched in some instances and fenestrate in others see Shouldergirdle and Sternum p 4 But as hyaline cartilage is merely to be considered a consolidated primordial cell mass and a very fastgrowing tissue also it is not surprising to find it running riot over a large number of morphological territories op cit p 4 this takes place to the greatest extent in the lowest and most generalized types which however large even gigantic they may become are nevertheless mere embryos throughout life in respect of their morphological development The sharp distinction between the skull and the vertebrae is well seen in thisthat X In the Amphibia no definite line can be drawn between parastoses and ectostoses and the most typical endosteal deposit is merely an ossification of that part of the fibrous laminae which immediately enesses the cartilage 756DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL whilst the whole of the notochordal region of the skull belongs to the occiput this region if it had suffered fission would have sufficed to form a whole series of vertebrae Thus that cranial region which has most of the vertebral nature in it cannot answer to one actual vertebral segment seeing that it contains subjected to the law of a new type of growth several potential segments As the skull proper cannot be shown to conform to the vertebral column so neither can the facial arches be put into the same category with the ribs for the present they must wait until their development has been worked out perfectly in a considerable number of Vertebrate types I mention this to excuse myself from all controversy con cerning them in the present communication The mouth and the fauces the faucial region is of great extent in the Cyclostomous Fishes are hedged in by what are evidently one class of cartilages these may be either free rods or fenestrate plates I propose to call these the faciofaucial  skeleton These bars extend beyond the skull and are very variably attached to itin some of the lowest Vertebrates as the Cyclostomi the Chimeroids and the Lepidosiren being anteriorly mere outgrowths of the skull whilst in the higher Classes they have a very independent development In the Bird there are only three poststomal arches developed whilst in the gillbearing  Ichthyopsida there are several It seemed to me to be necessary to preface the description that is to follow with these remarks but I must now let the Birds head tell its own tale What there may be in this account which will not harmonize with the descriptions given in the former paper will be duly noted from time to time and the reasons for a modified nomenclature will be given Structure of the Chicks Skull First StageHead of Embryo 3 lines long 4th Day of Incubation The appearance of the chicks head and face on the 4th day as seen from below is well shown in Professor HUXLEYS figure op cit p 139 fig 57 F another figure F shows the cartilaginous cranium of the same In Plate LXXXI figs 1  21 have given what appears to me to be the state of things at this early stage fig 1 however the lower view is somewhat diagrammatic as I have in it anticipated the differentiation of the pterygopalatine bar pgpa from the next stage these show the parts as magnified 9 diameters The visceral clefts Plate LXXXI fig 1 123 are still evident and the frontonasal process fn is as yet free at its sides so that the anterior nares n are still mere cleftsthe foremost or prestomal clefts The great mouthcleft m is foursided with concave sides and produced angles and the anterior angles run into the nasal clefts these clefts and their intervening arches all evidently belong to one category the arches surround and the clefts open into the orofaucial cavity To show the character of the skullfloor a chicks head at this stage has been sliced completely through horizontally fig 2 the second and third cerebral vesicles have been completely removed and the first vesicle the subdividing rudiment of the hemispheres has had its upper half removed the lower half of each eyeball is shown also in situ 757MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND The notochord nc is seen to be half the length of the head or a line and a half and to reach within a very slight distance of the pituitary space pts this relative but not real retreat of the notochord now bespeaks the first appearance of the post pituitary part of the basisphenoidal region The notochord is clubbed at its fore end it then is narrower then thicker between the auditory sacs cl and is again somewhat diminished as it passes into the atlantal region The broad thick plate of cartilage shown as somewhat sliced away horizontally above the cochlear cavities cl in the figure which lies right and left of the notochord is the  investing mass  iv of RATHKE At this stage the  investing mass  is rapidly passing from simple cartilage into the solid hyaline variety it is most dense nearest the notochord and becomes more and more gelatinous as it is traced upwards into the wall of the cranium Hence the commencement of the spinal chord is not as yet bridged over by a cartilaginous superoccipital plate and the cartilage in which the upper part of the auditory sacs are imbedded is still in a soft condition Here it may be at once remarked that no separate cartilaginous auditory capsule is formed in the chick such as can be plainly seen in the Tadpole but the two moieties of the investing mass grow into one continuous  occipitootic  cartilage t At a small distance in front of the cochlear cavity cl the investing mass is suddenly narrowed this is where the fifth nerve passes out and this nerve divides the occipitootic region from the posterior sphenoidal At most the clubbed anterior end of the notochord is wedged into the very end of the basisphenoidal region and afterwards it will be seen that the whole of its cranial portion becomes the axis of the basioccipital All the nerves between the fifth cranial and the first spinal are related to the investing mass so that even if it were ceded that the occipital region is essentially vertebral in its nature yet it must then be looked upon not as one segment but the nonsegmented counterpart of several On each side of the end of the notochord the investing mass at first grows outwards in an angular manner shown in Professor HUXLEYS fig 57 F and in Plate LXXXI fig 2 lg these angles are the rudiments of the cartilaginous  lingulae sphenoidales these parts arise from the roots of the trabeculce4  RATHKEs account of this part in his work on the Snake Entwickelungsgeschichte der Natter 1839 is thoroughly correct I will give it as translated by Professor HUXLEY Croon Lect p 56 and Elem Comp Anat p 237 The differences between the basis of the skull and the vertebral column in the earliest embryonic condition are 1 That round that part of the notochord which belongs to the head more of the blastema that is to be applied in the spinal column to the formation of the vertebrae and their different ligaments is aggregated than around the rest of its extent and 2 that this mass grows out beyond the notochord to form the cranial trabeculm t The periotic mass which becomes perfectly segmented from the occipital sclerotome in many Mammals but in them only in the last or osseous stage of growthis never cloven in any degree from its surroundings in the Fowl it is however partially cloven off in many Waterbirds by a fenestra which appears between the epiotic and the lower edge of the superoccipital  I think that RATIIrES term middle trabecula may be dropped it appears to me to be merely the elatinous precursor of the  posterior clinoid wall and has nothing in common with the basal paired trabeculhe See HUXLEYs Croon Lect p 57 758DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL The trabecular roots are transversely crested the somewhat diagrammatic figure 2 shows this but feebly this is the angle of that bend formed by the early skull called the cranial flexure  HUXLEY Elem p 137 This crest becomes very large and is persistent notwithstanding the afterstraightening of the craniofacial axis it is connected with the high  posterior clinoid wall The anterior smaller moiety of the craniofacial axis is bent first at an acute and afterwards at an obtuse angle it is becoming obtuse on the fourth day all this fore part is formed by the  paired trabeculae these are flat bands of at present soft or simple cartilage they are now about o of an inch in width and are moderately thick in proportion These bands are gently curved outwards at first to enclose an elegantly ovoidal membra nous space the pituitary space Plate LXXXI fig 2 tr pts this space is enclosed by the early coalescence of the symmetrical bands in front of it and this coalesced part is nearly equal in length to the pituitary region The trabecule maintain a similar size to their extremities but at their coalesced part they have begun to form an arched outgrowth on each sde  these symmetrical expansions are the rudiments of the  aliethmoidal and aliseptal cartilages of the nasal labyrinth This broadened ethmoidal part of the trabecule is bent backwards in a rounded manner on itself so that the remaining part of the trabeculhe lies on a lower plane parallel with the pituitary floor and with the free ends looking directly backwards Plate LXXXI fig 1 ctr the free ends are slightly divergent and are separated by a space about equal to their own width These free retral ends of the trabecule are the trabecular horns they form the soft skeleton of the  frontonasal lamina fn and are developed into the  ale nasi or alinasal lamina and do not coalesce to form the intermaxillary axis or  prenasal cartilage as I once supposed see former paper pp 121  122 The  frontonasal laminae will have united with the maxillary rudiment mr to enclose the anterior nares n before the  intermaxillary axis will be evident this will be described in the next stage Here one may pause to remark that the nasal labyrinth is formed continuously with the primordial cranium just as is the case with the otic cap sule any segmentation that may appear afterwards will thus be a secondary morpho logical process and thus the eyeballs are sharply distinguished from the other sense capsules which from their undefined skeletal growth and their relations to the visceral arches form a most puzzling problem to the morphologist It will be seen from this description that the anterior sphenoidal region is scarcely at all represented at this stage for the somewhat narrowed waist formed by the trabeculae immediately in front of the pituitary body is all that has yet appeared of the anterior clinoids the prepituitary part of the basisphenoid and the presphenoid This latter part is indeed feebly represented in the adult Bird and only occupies an angular space above the junction of the perpendicular ethmoid with the basisphenoid At present there is a curved clubbed subocular bar the  maxillary rudiment  mr which comes very close at its anterior clubbed end to the  frontonasal lamina but has not yet united with it to enclose the anterior nares n In fig 1 the cartilaginous differentiation of 759MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND the pith of this bar my study of which has been from fine transverse sections in the next stage is somewhat anticipated The axis of this soft bar is converted into the palatal and pterygoid rods pa pg and from the outer edge of each of these bent clubs a lamina grows downwards see HUXLEY op cit fig 57 G 1 in the internal fibrous stroma of which the maxillary and jugal bones are afterwards formed The axis of the maxillary rudiment never has any cartilaginous connexion anteriorly in the Bird with the ethmoidal lamina prefrontal and behind the chondrification of the pterygoid portion of this axis is quite distinct from and much later than that of the quadrate Here we see that the subocular arch is much modified from what is seen in the Ichthyopsida The primordial skull figured by Professor HUXLEY fig 57 F must have been from a less mature embryo than that which I am here illustrating as my first stage for in that figure the quadrate qu is shown as continuous with the anteroexternal part of the investing mass In my specimen Plate LXXXI figs 1  2 u the quadrate is already a very distinct tuberous mass of consistent cartilage rapidly becoming hyaline MECKELS cartilage nk is also very distinct and solid and its articular end has a sinuous face answering to that on the lower end of the quadrate whilst the posterior and internal angular outgrowths have already appeared fig 1 mk These Meckelian rods are very short in proportion to their thickness are gently curved forwards and nearly meet at the mid line by rounded ends These axial parts of the first pair of poststomal laminae are surrounded by very delicate blastemathe parent tissue of the splints muscles and skin of the lower jaw the outline of this primordial mandible is emarginate at the mid line That which is perhaps the most noteworthy in the first poststomal arch at this stage is its position with regard to the auditory capsule its pier the quadrate is seg mented from the anteroexternal angle of the investing mass directly in front of the periotic capsule and opposite the junction of the anterior with the middle third of the cranial part of the notochord whilst the fifth nerve 5 passes out in front of it This normal position is lost and then regained before the chick is ripe Close behind the quadrate there is the first poststomal cleft 1 ready to become converted into the complex tympanic cavity In the obtuse angle formed by the Meckelian rods and lying on a higher plane than those rods we find the distal arrested cartilages that belong to the second poststomal arch these are the cerato and basihyals Plate LXXXI fig 1 ch bh At present these are merely thickened masses of blastema their outline being somewhat indistinct as the young cells of which they are composed are not sharply separated from the formative substance which will become their perichondrial investment The cerato hyals ch are even now only half the size of the mandibular rods but this is the greatest relative size they attain for they diminish much afterwards There is no proper skeletal substance between the top of the ceratohyals and the tissue that forms the auditory  columella stapes this latter part is not differentiated sufficiently to be described at present it is both late in appearance and also very minute 760DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL The basihyal bh although formed in the united edges of symmetrical laminae is even as a defined mass of thickened blastema quite azygous it is tearshaped the narrow end lying between the lower ends of the ceratohyals this basal part is better defined than the arches and chondrifies first Behind the second fastclosing cleft 2 there is now to be seen a pair of welldefined rods nearly as large as the Meckelian cartilages and as early in their chondrification these are the branchials cbr answering to the first branchial arch of the Ichthyopsida There is a less distinct upper piece pointed and small ebr and a delicate streak of illdefined blastema behind and between bbr this latter is formed into the long slender socalled urohyal the counterpart of the  basibranchial band Behind the branchial arch a chink still indicates the place of the third visceral cleft 3 At this early stage the arch of the tongue has begun to lie within the mandibular arch just as the lessened first branchial arch comes to lie within the massive hyoid arch in the Osseous Fish Already the third visceral arch of the Bird has outgrown the seconda state of things universal in the Class of Birds Before leaving this stage it may be noted as instructively parallel with that which is persistent in Cartilaginous Fishes that there is no exoskeleton no praemaxillee maxillse dentaries angulars or the like the mouth and unenclosed nostrils are entirely below the head these and the rudimentary tympanic cavities open freely into each other and are all lined with dermal tissue which is as it were tucked in between the visceral laminae from the outer surface of the head Second StageIHead of Embryo from 4 to 5 lines long 5th to 7th Days of Incubation In the course of twentyfour hours great changes have taken place in the chicks skull and face In an embryo with a head 4 lines long Plate LXXXI fig 3 6 diam a vertical section shows the notochordal region to be shorter than that formed by the trabecule and this anterior moiety of the craniofacial axis has become much straighter the head having now to a great extent recovered from the  cranial flexure The  in vesting mass has become more solid and a distinct swelling on each side posteriorly shows how the occipital condyle oc is formedvery reptilian however in shape at first On each side a thin soft lamina of cartilage eo is growing up behind the third cerebral vesicle cv 3 this is the commencement of the occipital plane At the angle formed by the bending of the primordial cranium upon itself a transverse crest of cartilage has grown rapidly upwards and backwards this the posterior clinoid wall protects the pituitary body behind and lies in the midst of a quantity of delicate stroma which  Till lately I have partly followed Professor OWENS nomenolature for the third poststomal arch of the Bird calling its moieties  thyrohyal See Brit Assoc  Report on Archetype 1847 p 295 fig 23 where the lower piece is identified as the hypobranchial of the Fish and the upper is called  ceratobranchial I find however that the  thyrohyals of the Batrachia and Mammalia are merely retral  hypobranchial processes and I cannot consider the lower piece in the Bird to be other than the  ceratobranchial MDCCCLXl 5 I 761MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND eventually becomes the fore part of the  tentorium cerebelli The internal carotid artery ie is seen to be entering the skull in front of this wall The greater part of the investing mass may now be treated of as the basioccipital region bo anteriorly the nascent fibrous tissue is thickening below this part to become a bed for the deposit of the basitemporal The pituitary space is now much foreshortened very deep and is indicated in the figure by the entrance of the internal carotid artery ie the cartilage has become high even below and between the optic nerves 2 and close in front of the pituitary body the anterior clinoid ridge acl has commenced But in front of the optic nerves the greatest and most sudden change has taken place the very short broad waist between the pituitary space and the rudimentary ethmoidal alae shown in fig 2 being at this stage greatly elongated and altogether developed into a high crest this is the ethmopre sphenoidal plate psp eth This plate which is rapidly passing into hyaline carti lage is somewhat higher behind than before is nearly straight above is oblique behind above the optic nerves concave below and has a gently convex margin in front The alae of the nasal labyrinth are not shown in this section but above and below the line where these have been cut away on the left side two projections are seen The upper of these is the retral spike in which the ethmoid ends behind above the olfactory crura whilst the lower process is one of the greatest importance in the morphology of the face it being the prenasal or snoutcartilage pn This part which is the endoskeletal axis of the premaxillary region grows at first backwards as well as downwards having the same direction as the  frontonasal lamina and being an azygous outgrowth from the crest which forms between the trabecular cornuathe rudimentary septum nasi continuous with the ethmopresphenoidal plate The cornua themselves as I have already asserted develope themselves into the ale nasi This con dition of the prenasal cartilage is like what is seen in the ripe embryo of the Green Turtle Chelone mydas in that animal however it is less rounded in shape and projects further downwards forming a soft core to the premaxillariest The thick arcuate inferior edge of the ethmopresphenoidal plate has already begun to be underlain by that fibrous stroma which afterwards thickens very much between the basis cranii and palatal skin to form a nidus for the rostral part of the  parasphenoid Below and on each side of the basis cranii the maxillary rudiment has begun to send downwards the facial lamina in which the maxillary and jugal bones are afterwards de veloped and to have a more distinct rod on the inner side which becomes the palatine pa and the pterygoid pg but this will be best studied in a chick a day or two  This spike is called  crista galli crg in my former paper but Professor HUXLEY has shown me recently that there is nothing in the Bird which answers to that plate save that notched and grooved part of the perpendicular ethmoid which lies exactly between the olfactory nerves so that practically it may be said to be undeveloped in this Class t Professor HUXLEY is strongly inclined to believe that the  trabecule from their roots are in reality the foremost and of necessity the innermost pair of visceral arches 762DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL older I shall also leave the mandibular mk and hyoid cartilages h for description from an older embryo The development of the parts goes on very rapidly so that when the head is 5 lines in length a much clearer idea of the structure of the parts can be obtained A vertical section lefthand of the septum of such a skull is shown in Plate LXXXI fig 4 and a side view in fig 5 both magnified 6 diameters in these views the cerebral vesicles are not figured A low ornithic type such as is persistent in the Ostrich is now attained I have already had to compare the skull of the chick with that of a Plagiostome and of a Turtle after the Struthious stage has been passed many of the higher ornithic spe cializations will rapidly appear The straightening of the craniofacial axis has gone on so as to make the face much more prognathous and the axis of the anterior part of the face pn is especially altered so as to have already taken on an ornithic character the boundary also between the nasal and orbital regions can now be seen One landmark has become especially visible on account of the denser condition of the cartilage this is the bridge for the nasal nerve nn in the adult bird this is seen near the free posteroinferior angle of the nasal septum For some distance behind this bridge the cartilage continues thicker than we find it between the eyeballs the larger thinner posterior part of the cranio facial axis answers to the whole of the presphenoid and the posterior or interorbital part of the perpendicular ethmoid The grooves for the olfactory nerve 1 can be well seen and the retral spike of the ethmoid surmounting the nervegrooves has become much more defined and has begun to take a backward direction instead of the vertical and human direction it had a day or two before see Plate LXXXI fig 3 eth This is now the highest part of the craniofacial axis whereas the presphenoid was the highest in the last embryo The whole base of the prepituitary part of the primordial skull is very thick and rounded and its thickness from side to side increases in the prenasal cartilage pn which now shows itself to be a very fit model on which the premaxil laries of any type of Bird might be formed in no Bird whatever let the shape of its face be what it will is the type of the first model or platform wholly lost although in every case the primordial structure into the type of which they were cast as it were undergoes very early wasting Between the palatal skin below and the still very arcuate skullbase above a considerable mass of stroma is formed which is cordiform in section and which soon becomes the seat of the rostral or anterior parasphenoidal ossification this rostral stroma rst is shown in fig 6 magnified 12 diameters This tract is com posed of thinwalled baggy cells which never chondrify except on the surface in certain birds as the Psittacinae and Ardeine but develope either into bone internally or into periosteum externally In fig 7 the differentiation of the tissues that underlie the skullbase in the posterior ethmoidal region is shown magnified 160 diameters The ethmoid eth is already formed of ordinary hyaline cartilage with abundant intercel lular substance and tearshaped cells next below this is a tract of very delicate granular 5 2 763MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND stroma grst then a deep layer of the largercelled young connective tissue rst and below this the epithelium of the palate epl The aggregation of a thick bed of nascent fibrous tissue between the skullbase and the palate and fauces and the conver sion of the greater part of this mass into bone in a very early stage is common to many of the Vertebratafor instance the Ganoid and Teleostean Fishes the Amphibians and Ophidians the Lizards show this structure much more feebly The thickened and solidified postpituitary part of the basis cranii shows this super faucial massthe seat of the basitemporal ossifications Plate LXXXI fig 4 btst the fibrous layer thins out towards the occipital condyle The parts of the primordial skull can now be made out more clearly the exoccipital lamina eo is growing upwards to meet its fellow in the superoccipital region so and thus enclose the spinal chord Above the meatus internus mi the anterior semicircular canal is seen to bulge in wards and to grow backwards below and behind the meatus is seen the eighth nerve 8 below and in front of it the cochlear elevation cl nearing the mid line The low an terior clinoid elevation acl and the high posterior clinoid wall pdl are well seen and the notochord nc mounting up between the moieties of this wall which now begin to coalesce across their middle they do not unite however either above or below A thin lobe of cartilage ascends the side wall of the skull outside and behind the posterior clinoid wall this is the rudiment of the alisphenoid as it is connected with the periotic capsule by a bridge of cartilage which arches over the trigeminal nerve 5 The internal carotid artery ie finds its way into the pituitary space pts through a mass of soft fibrous stroma On the outer side of the primordial skull other parts can be seen this view is given in fig 5 here the facial arches are also shown The nasal labyrinth developes with extraordinary rapidity so that by the end of the first week all the main parts can be seen Anteriorly the flat trabecular horn has expanded into the alinasal cartilage aln with its enclosed turbinal or vestibular flap nt behind this is the aliseptal region als enclosing the inferior turbinal co and posteriorly there is the alietethe thmoidal lamina which is continued downwards between the nose and the eye as the anteorbital plate or  pars plana  pp  Fig 6 shows a transversely vertical section 12 diam through the ethmoidal region immediately in front of the anteorbital laminae pp which are seen to be continuous with the aliethmoidal coil ale and to have no distinct  middle turbinal outgrowth on their anterior face In this view part of the cartilaginous scle rotic scl is shown and the section is also made through the middle of the palatine bar pa Here is seen the true  schizognathous  condition of the palate the mouth  The  pars plana  is continuous with the rest of the nasal labyrinth in all Birds my earlier studies of these parts misled me and in my paper  On the Osteology of the Gallinacee  Zool Trans 1863 vol v p 179 I spoke of this plate as being  autogenous in its cartilaginous state as well as in its ossified condition In the paper on the Ostrichs skull p 127 et seq this part was described as continuous with the rest of the nasal labyrinth 764DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL cavity being continuous between the narrow palatines with the plicated nasal sac although the chink between the rostral stroma rst and the anteorbital plate is very narrow Seen from the outside the alisphenoid as shows an oblique crest this is the post frontal plate pf it is largely developed in Fishes but entirely absent as is also the alisphenoid itself in the Lizards and Chelonians Inferolaterally the cartilage of the auditory region is scooped to form the tympanic cavity but at present this part is filled with a gelatinous stroma which grows very rapidly for a week or two and is then absorbed The horizontal hsc and posterior psc semicircular canals now shine out through the occipital cartilage and the exoccipital region eo has developed its tympanic wing The quadrate cartilage q has received a large and peculiar development and like the uncloven orbitonasal septum has attained a struthious condition Anteriorly the little nodule figured in the First Stage Plate LXXXI figs 1  2 q has grown into an arched bluntpointed  orbital process inferiorly it has become a thick bar with two oblique condyles for articulation with the mandible whilst posteriorly it has grown into a long arched crus which not only articulates with the periotic capsule above the junction of the prootic and opisthotic regions but also with the exoccipital in front of the root of its tympanic wing This articulation is shown in fig 5a 16 diam and fig 5 6 diam and it is seen to answer to what is depicted in my former paper on the Ostrichtribe Plates VIIXIv in the Tinamou Plate xv fig 1 q some recovery of the original position is attained  Where the quadrate cartilage articulates with the cranium the side wall is somewhat scooped but further down two small clefts appear which however never go beyond the condition of fenestrne these are the fenestra ovalis and f rotunda or f ves tibuli and f cochleme The fenestra ovalis is properly speaking an aperture in the fundus of the cupshaped articular cavity in which the head of the stapes Plate LXXXI figs 5  5a st is articulated and is morphologically like the acetabular fenestra of the Bird and the glenoid fenestra of the Proteus and Cryptobranchus see  Shouldergirdle and Sternum pl 3 figs 1  3 gl From the first the parts of the hyoid arch are very inferior in size and later in deve lopment than those of the mandible at this stage after the quadrate has undergone so much modification and is so well chondrified the stapes can only now be distinctly seen and its outgrowths are mere budlike projections from the main shaft It is seen that the  I must insist on the zoological importance of this condition of the quadrate which is temporary in the Fowl and persistent in the Struthionide in a large number of Birds the head of the quadrate instead of being single as in the Struthionide and in this early stage of the Fowl is divided into two short crura one of which the anteroexternal keeps its normal place on the prootic whilst the posterointernal crus retains the acquired struthious relation with the exoccipital ala The Parrots come nearest to the Fowls in the forward position of both the articular facets which are separated by a very narrow tract in both these types the inner is slightly behind the outer 765MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND head of the quadrate projects some distance behind that of the stapes but this truly ornithic modification is exceptionally only of short duration in the Fowl At present the stapes is relatively a much more massive bar than afterwards seen from the front and side Plate LXXXI figs 9  10 24 diam it appears as a flattened rod curved forwards with an oval head and a trilobate flattened base the leading ray of which is most curved forwards and outwards There is still a considerable tract of cartilage to be described in the proximal part of the face namely the pterygopalatine bar The prenasal cartilage already described is an azygous prestomal counterpart of the Meckelian rods although it does not become cloven from the primordial skull and is never related to a free proximal cartilage like the Meckelian bars but the pterygopalatine bar is perhaps the most difficult part of the cephalic skeleton to interpret Seeing its primordial independence of the skull in the chick and noting its early subdivision into a posterior short and an anterior longer bar it seems to be very feasible to compare its two divisions with the quadrate and the Meckelian rod It lies above and in front of the great stomal cleft much as the mandibular rods lie below and behind but its point of suspension is a great difficulty and the mind of the observer will revert to its various development in the Ichthyopsida In the Chimaeroids and in the Lepidosiren this part is not only continuous with the skullbase but also with the prenasal cartilage in front and with the common pier of the mandibular and hyoid arches MULLER Myxinoids pl v fig 2 and HUXLEY op cit p 196 fig 78 and p 209 fig 85 in the Frog the palatine passes anteriorly directly into the prefrontal cartilage op cit p 216 fig 87 In the chick the position of the pterygopalatine bar is below and external to the basis cranii figs 5  6 from which it is separate from its first differentiation it has however a much more intimate connexion with the quadrate but is well differentiated from it on the fourth day Plate LXXXI fig 1 pg g and indeed has very differenthistological characters The suspensorial parts of the pterygopalatine bar are feebly developed and are late in their appearance these come to be below the optic foramen for the pterygoid and below the prefrontal plate for the palatine these will be described hereafter At present the rela tion of the palatine bar to the prefrontal plate fig 6 pp pa is totally unlike what is seen in the Frog for between the two there is not only the thick fibrous stroma in which the delicate palatine bar is imbedded but also the open channel which connects the cavity of the mouth with the interior of the nasal labyrinth I would much rather interpret this bar by its specialized and freed condition in the Bird than by what is seen in the low Vertebrate types where the rampant growth of cartilage masks the proper morphological boundaries and yet even in the high type the bar would seem to bear two interpretationsnamely that it may be a single arch like the mandibular the pterygoid being the equivalent of the quadrate or on the other hand the pterygoid and the palatine may b e proximal parts of two arches neither of which has  This bar must be studied at an earlier stage in Cyclodont Lizards and Chamtcleons the trilobate hyoid portion is quite distinct from the clubbed periotic rod 766DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL a free descending ray but I am extremely doubtful about the latter interpretation and strongly incline to regard the mandibular pterygopalatine and trabecular rays as true serial counterparts The true histological growth and development of the pterygopalatine bar has cost me much labour only by examining sections made at many stages and by seeing these under very high powers has the meaning been made apparent In a freshmade section at this stage Plate LXXXI fig 6 the tissues composing the ethmoid eth the rostrum rst the palatine pa and the sclerotic scl do not appear very much unlike when seen by low powers afterwards their differing characters may be seen The cells com posing the sclerotic scl are smaller than those which make up the ethmoid eth but they rapidly form hyaline cartilage and both these tracts are more translucent than the rostral stroma or the cells composing the palatine The latter can however be seen to transmit the light better than the rostral mass and by the use of high powers 320 diam the structure of the rod becomes sharply distinguished from the nascent cellular tissue in which it is imbedded and also from the more advanced connectivetissue cells of the rostrum Much the greater part of the palatine bar fig 11 is composed of delicate sharpended fusiform cells of simple cartilage having large granular nuclei but the pith of the bar is composed of still more delicate and smaller cells having an oval form and without apparent nucleiat least as seen magnified 320 diameters it is this pith which is the first to ossify and the transformation of the simple cartilage into bone is so rapid as to give the deposit the appearance of a membrane bonet The further development of the palatine bar will be described hereafter and the pterygoid pg which is at present composed of simple cartilage similar to that of the palatine region will be considered at the same time There now remain for description the free part of the facial poststomal arches and the keystones that complete them There is no keystone to the mandibular arch which  Professor HuxLEY is disposed to look upon what I call simple cartilage as merely  indifferent tissue t For many years the development of the pterygopalatine bar in the Sauropsida and Mammalia has been a great difficulty to me as with moderately high powers at stages more advanced than the one under notice I could not well see how the main part of the bar differed from a membrane bone yet I had discovered the existence of hyaline cartilage in several parts of the bar in Birds In the Passerinme and some others the broad transpalatine angle is not ossified by the proper palatine centre but by a separate endosteal deposit and that long after the main bar so that the simple cartilage gains time for a plentiful intercellular deposit In the Woodpecker Picus viridis the inner edge of each palatine does not ossify from the main bony rod but developes into hyaline cartilage coalesces with its counterpart of the other side and then slowly and feebly ossifies by endostosis this centre being properly speaking an azygous c mesopterygoid Hyaline cartilage may be found at the pterygoid end of the palatine proper in certain Birds e g Caprimulgus then it also appears in the counterpart facet in the pterygoid it is always present on the quadrate end of the pterygoid and whenever this bone articulates with a basipterygoid process a meniscoid plate is developed on the corre sponding part of the pterygoid In many Reptiles Lacertians and Chelonians the posterior part of the sub ocular cartilage chondrifies and developes into a straight rod which is obliquely situated above the fibrous or main pterygoid  ossifying separately it becomes the socalled columella the pterygoid of the higher Birds is more nearly related to this than to the underlying fibrous bone 767MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND is entirely composed of the articulomeckelian rod This rod Plate LXXXI figs 5  12 mk ar is a gently curved very solid bar of hyaline cartilage it bulges and narrows two or three times but does not greatly diminish in size even at its rounded anterior end The articular portion is scooped in harmony with the swellings on the lower face of the quadrate and from this part there project two fingershaped processes these are the internal iap and posterior pap angular processes Already these processes show the type to which the bird belongs for they have a peculiar development in the whole GalloAnserine  series and in one or two mixed cognate forms for instance in the Flamingo they attain their most extraordinary development in the  Tetraonine  sub group of the Gallina and especially in Tetrao utrogallzs In a somewhat earlier stage head of embryo 41 lines long see Plate LXXXI fig 12 12 diam notwithstanding the rapid elongation of the Meckelian bar mk these pro cesses are scarcely more developed than in the Struthious Birds see former paper Plates IIXIV and the ends of these short processes are very knobbed In this instance the nascent connective fibres surrounding these parts were quite free from osseous deposit and so was the rest of the primordial skull now representing the Cartilaginous Fishes but in one a day or so older the splintbones had commenced outside the perichondrium of the Meckelian rod fig 13 su Here the upper view of the articular part of the man dible shows that it is a bifurcating or partially double ray which developes a groove andridged articular surface on its upper face at the point of bifurcation The next poststomal cephalic arch the hyoid is slow of growth feeble in develop ment and rapidly gains an enclosed position instead of maintaining its proper surface parallelism with the mandibles The arches themselves the ceratohyals are mere distal rudiments such as we often see in the costal arches a long space of mere fibrous tissue intervening between the arch and the pier Their chondrification is late as a correlate of their feeble growth A somewhat earlier and stouter piece of cartilage appears between and behind them the basihyal bh it is

ossified whilst the secondary or splintskeleton is very frail and delicate such skeletons are possessed by the Lumpfish Cyclopterus and by the Salmon In the illustrations of this stage the figures are

a retral lobe could just be distinguished on each side of the pituitary space now a very perfect differentiation of this part is manifest and a pair of very notable earshaped processes Plate LXXXII

sphenoidales  of the human embryo they receive their osseous deposit from another source namely from the azygous para sphenoidal piece but to interpret the primordial skeleton by the afterdeposits of bone is to study the mask and not the face Behind the pituitary space the base of the skull in its thick part forms a very narrow waist and the moieties of this pinched part are also contracted at their inner edge This lateral retreat of the fore part of the investing mass gives rise to RATIIKES posterior basicranial fontanelle pbf it is occupied along its mid line by the noto chord Plate

on the outside they are bounded on the lower face of the skull by the carotid groove cg and posteriorly they nearly reach to the foramen for the vagus nerve 8 The noto chord nc which lies above as well as between the moieties of the investing mass has relatively receded through the more rapid growth of the surrounding structures it is now at its fullest development and osseous tissue has appeared on its upper surface behind Although belonging in the early embryo to the basioccipital region only the notochord becomes constricted in several places Plate LXXXII fig 3 nc as if it were ready if the investing mass were so disposed to undergo hourglasslike segmentation The cells of which the swollen parts are composed are oval thinwalled and contain many granules Plate LXXXII fig 5

exoccipital and the sulcus is the rudiment of the tympanic cavity Plate LXXXII fig 1 ty at present it is filled with a soft flocculent stroma soon to be absorbed The upper head of the quadrate is loosing its connexion with the occipital ala at the end of the sulcus and is acquiring a cupandball articulation with the fore part The low ridge bounding the sulcus externally is the rudiment of the

strongly inveighed against since by Professor HtxLEY At page 113 I spoke of these as the distinct counterparts of the palatine plate of the mammalian maxillary I shall henceforth drop the term

postmaxillary  the Fowl does not possess it I am nlow satisfied that although many birds have the additional Lacertian bone truly represented by maxillary outgrowths yet these have no existence in the Gallinaceae and in no bird is there a distinct septomaxillary the counterpart of the exceptional  postmaxillary  o the Bird must be sought for far down amongst the Ganoid fishes 773MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND My description of these parts will differ considerably from that given in my former paper as in my earlier observations I had mistaken the cellular tissue composing the  rostrum  for simple cartilage and the two parosteal tracts behind it the basitem porals for ectosteal plates the layer of cartilage also which I supposed  Struthious Skull p 117 to form a floor to the pituitary space has no existence in the Bird Professor HUXLEY Op cit p 170 first showed that the socalled  basipresphenoid of osseous Fishes is nothing but a membrane bone in them and in the Amphibia a thick tract of cpalatofatucial subcutaneous fibrous tissue is converted into a large beam of bone which runs forwards beneath the nasal region anteriorly and backwards below the temporal region behind This bone is well developed in the Anmphibia HUXLEY op cit p 214 fig 86 B x and its posterior or temporal wings are outspread whereas in the Fish they are often turned very sharply upwards In the chick in the next stage to be described there is exactly such a tract of bone but it has formed strong bony attachments to the true skullbase at present this connexion has begun but it is slight and easily detached but besides this the osseous matter is in three separate territories instead of being one continuous sheet as in the Fish and Frog The anterior narrow ossicle the  rostrum is styloid it is formed by the conversion into bone of the rostral stroma figured in Plate LXXXI figs 6  7 rst posteriorly osseous matter has run froin it into the lower edge of the walls of the pituitary space here the innermost part of a parosteal tract has become the ectosteal layer to the carti lage and parostoses ectostoses and endostoses all run into each other the first being the  cue  to the second and third this I call the grafting of an exoskeletca splint bone ulpon an endoskceletal region The osseous deposit so far forth as it has immediate relation to the cartilage of the pituitary region forms a pair of basisphenoidal ossiclesthe equivalents of the sym mnetrical basisphenoidals of the Lizard and of Man these are figured as detached from the rostrum  in Plate LXXXII figs 1  3 bs on the upper surface fig 3 it is shown how the bony matter creeps round and into the trabecular root The rest of the basis cranii is quite separable from the thick subcutaneous floor and the breadth suddenly expands behind the pituitary region so also the faucial portion of the fibrous mat is of great breadth fig 2 bt In shape this layer is like the leaf of a Bauhinia the  rostrum  answering to the leafstalk the posterior margin of the bilobate mass is exaggerated as to distinctness in the figure but in reality the web thins out rapidly in front of the exit of the vagus nerves 8 this sudden change in the thickness of the cranial floor is very remarkable even in the adult bird Two large tracts of osseous deposit the basitemporals having a somewhat reniform outline have already appeared in this thick fibrous web fig 2 bt they are elegantly  In certain osseous Fishes for example the Perch Pike Gurnard c the prepituitary portion of the basi sphenoidal cartilage is invested by a delicate ectosteal sheath this azygous basisphenoid is thus confined to the front of the pituitary space throuLgh the remarkable development of the prootic floor which takes up so much of the investing mass

Ichthyopsidan will be fully represented and the open pituitary space will be filled in below by the extraneous plate It cannot be void of interest that the ornithic embryo is thus seen to arrive at its further goal by passing at first along Ichthyopsidan paths  not only is this seen in the skullbase but also in all the outworks of the face The anterior termination of the rostrum is very thin it lies in the midst of a large mass of stroma Plate LXXXII fig 7 rbs underlying the perpendicular eth moid eth and above and between the laminar palatines pa this section shows well how thorough the amalgamation of the trabecule becomes Conjijgation of symmetrical bands of simple cartilage at the mid line is a frequent phenomenon in the development of the skeleton Where the moieties of the investing mass  embrace the pituitary body and thus become trabecule all the prenotochordal part of the early skullbase is trabecular there the cartilage grows upwards into the alisphenoid Plate

the third week of incubation the head being an inch in length or onethird larger than that from which the figures 1 to 7 in Plate LXXXII are given this stage however will be drawn nearer to the last

But one of the most important changes to be noticed and which was commencing but not described in the third stage makes it profitable to compare the second with the fourth We saw that in the second stage Plate LXXXI figs 4  5 the craniofacial axis had attained to a Struthious condition in Plate LXXXIII fig 4 this part is seen to be rapidly passing into the Tinamine stage the region common to the ethmoid and nasal septum having become largely fenestrate this is intermediate between what is seen in 775MER W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND Tinamcns robusttus where the fenestra becomes a notch Struthious Skull Plate xv fig 8 cfc and T ariegatus where it has not appeared the skull in this respect being perfectly Struthious  The distinction between the perpendicular ethmoid and the septum nasi is merely histological in the Mammal but here we see a true morphological cleft which is now imperfect above and below and never in the Fowl quite complete above although this is common in the higher arboreal types The vertical orbitonasal septum has undergone fission between the eyes as well as between the olfactory sacs a considerable series of these clefts appear in this plate in some birds all after one fashion but in the Fowl there are only two and in the Struthionidae only one This posterior cleft divides the ethmoid eth from the pre sphenoid ps this latter region is very feebly developed for the fenestrate cleft ends below at a great distance from the base and the ethmoidal and basisphenoidal regions meet below it The bar which encloses the anterior cleft below is very instructive it is at present of considerable thickness Plate LXXXIII fig 2 sv although it is absorbed in a few days after this period It is alate and I propose to call the alar outgrowths the supervomerine laminae to connect them with their persistent and more largely developed counterparts in the Frog and the Crocodile They have their largest deve lopment behind see Plate LXXXII fig 11 which shows them magnified 20 diam and from below the vomer commences below the middle bar at their front end Plate LXXXIII fig 1 v when there are symmetrical vomers as in Piczis they commence in the fibrous tissue below the laminas The posterior edge of the nasal septum is also alate Plate LXXXII fig 4 sn and has in front of the ale an upper and a lower thickening and a groove connecting these enlargements this is caused by the burrow ing of the nasal nerve as it passes downwards and forwards In fig 4 the aliethmoidal aliseptal and alinasal outgrowthls are cut away ale als alx the rounded

perfectly ornithic character and in Tinamus robustus is a beautiful correlate of the segmentation of the shouldergirdle across the glenoid facet and the acuteness of the angle at which the scapula and coracoid are bent upon each other On the 9th day of incubation the scapulocoracoid bar of the chick is falcate anid partly segmented but by the time the craniofacial cleft is well formed n14th to 16th day the scapula has acquired a typical condition 776DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL An upper view of the primordial skull at this period shows much that is noteworthy see Plate LXXXIII fig 2 magnified 4 diam and with the basal parts left out of focus Tlhe nasal labyrinth is relatively very large and posteriorly overhangs the orbital region it is at once seen how large and important the structures are that are trabecular in their origin their territory ranges from tlle pituitary space pts behind to the end of the prenasal cartilage pz in front  the postpituitary or notochordal region is short but very broad In this upper view of the skullbase the basioccipital bo is seen to have the form of a flint spearhead it has a longitudinal ridge arising from the enclosed notochordal shaft its point lies between the divisions of the occipital condyle oc and its blunt end lies between the cochlear elevations cl The cartilage does not extend far beyond the cochleae anteromesially but has retired far from the mid line this state of things combined with the rapid growth of the investing mass and the arrest of the notochord has caused the posterior basicranial fontanelle pbf to become a large lozengeshaped space merely filled with delicate stroma The exoccipitals eo are spreading and the superoccipitals so are large and are approaching the mid line The prootics pro are rapidly developing as ectosteal plates in front of and below the ampulla of the anterior semicircular canal asc and a large ectosteal tract covers the middle part of the alisphenoidal region The pituitary space pts is enclosed with derived bony matter but a considerable amount of the anterior acl and posterior pcl clinoid walls are still soft All the rest of the skull its trabecular portion is still soft and the notochordal regions are also to a large extent cartilaginous The tem poral wings of the exoccipital and the postfrontal outgrowths of the alisphenoid pf as are seen to be large masses of cartilage The foramina ovalia 5 are very large fenestral spaces between the alisphenoidal and periotic regions and the foranmina rotunda 5 a are oval in shape and pierce the root of the  greater wing The centre of the alisphenoid is occupied by a fenestrate cleft asf this is cordate with the apex downwards and tends to divide the ala into two barsan anteromesial and a postero external The alisphenoids are wide apart mesially exaggerated in the figure and there is no more cartilage until we reach the mid line occupied by the knifeshaped pre sphenoid ps Thus not only is the roof of the primordial skull occupied by an enormous fontanelle but there are two mesial fontanelles in the lowest part of the floor and its anterior or upper division is almost entirely membranous The division between the two basal fontanelles the posterior clinoid wall is imperfect above in my former paper Plate VII fig 1  Plate ix fig 1 pcl this is shown to be perfect in the Struthionide In the embryo of Struthio camelus Plate vnii fig 1 os there is also a considerable tract of cartilage underlying the fore part of the hemispheres this is formed of the lesser wings orbitosphenoids these are aborted in the Fowl  The development of the sphenoidal region of the Fowl and of Carinate birds generally is thus seen to be clean contrary to what obtains in the Lacertilia where the alisphenoids are absent and the orbitosphenoids are very large fenestrate and have like the alisphenoid of the Bird several osseous centres MDCCCLXIX 5 L 777MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND The broad rooflike frontal surface

aliseptal als regions and a lesser chink marks the posterior boundary of the alinasal aln region The diverging terminations of the ala nasi retain their primary form as the outturned trabecular horns they closely embrace that azygous outgrowth of the trabecule which I have called the prenasal cartilage pn this snoutcartilage is now at its full size In the under view Plate LXXXIII fig 1 I have depicted the splints that show them selves on the basal plane whilst the lacrymals 1 and frontals cf are merely indicated by a dotted outline The superoccipitals Plate LXXXII figs 8  9 so have nearly met above the foramen magnum fin the exoccipitals eo have enclosed the vagus 8 and are enclosing the ninth nerve 9 behind they mount over the posterior semicircular canal 2SG and are spreading along the tympanic wings of the occipital cartilage The occipital condyle Plate LXXXII fig 8 and Plate LXXXIII fig 1 oc has a piece of the notochord nc projecting from its dimpled end in froint it ends below the basioccipital which is underfloored anteriorly by the huge expanding almost coalesced basitemporals bt On each side the lower edge of the squamosal sq is seen dipping between the post frontal and exoccipital outgrowths The rostrum Plate LXXXIII fig 1 rbs is bluntpointed anteriorly it lies on a somewhat higher plane than the basitemporals and has lost its former distinctness and simplicity having ossified much of the lower part of the basisphenoidal cartilage bs But not only has this centre affected the overlying cartilage it has grown into short wings between the heads of the pterygoids forming the roots of the  anterior pterygoid processes ap and into huge pretemporal wings the posterior pterygoid processes prp The anterior pterygoid processes are capped with a cartilaginous plate to be described anon and the posterior wings have the lingulal sphenoidales as their cartilaginous or endoskeletal root this will be dilated upon when the sections are explained There is one more basicranial splintthe vomer v this is a very small style at present emarginate anteriorly and blunt behind but it changes its shape afterwards it is developed in the same general tract of subcutaneous tissue as the  rostrum The rest of the base of the cartilaginous axis is enveloped in soft fibrous stroma which is only subject to ossification from lateral symmetrical points These symmetrical ossicles are developed in the subcutaneous stroma of the facial laminae they are the premaxillaries p maxillaries mx jugals j and qua dratojugals gj all these have acquired considerable density since the last period The palatines pa are thoroughly ossified and the pterygoids have lost most of their simple cartilaginous pith a hyaline plate abuts against the anterior pterygoid processes and the capped unossified posterior end is acquiring considerable density 778DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL The ectosteal sheath of the quadrate g has spread largely but the upper and lower condyles and the orbital process are still soft The occipitootic region when seen from within Plate LXXXII fig 9 shows how the superoccipital bony plates spread over the posterior part of the anterior semicir cular canals and how the  prootic ectosteal plate has begun to grow over the ampulla of the same canal Between the great anterior canal and the edge of the occipital plane there is a large irregular fossa filled now with gelatinous tissue and afterwards with ingrowths from the parietal and squamosal The alisphenoidal isthmus as and the investing mass iv where it bounds the posterior basicranial fontanelle have been cut through The left half of the same preparation seen as an internolateral view is shown in Plate LXXXII fig 10 here besides a better view of the foramina we see an additional proper periotic bony ectosteal platethe opisthotic op two more plates have yet to appearnamely the  pterotic  and  epiotic mastoid The skull at this stage is still farther illustrated by a posterior view Plate LXXXII fig 8 and here the roofbones are shown The great upper fontanelle is being oblite rated by the frontals f and the parietals p these are formed by an infinity of rapidly coalescing bony grains formed in the subcutaneous web they are flanked by the squamo sals sq which have a similar nature The two ascending occipital laminae although they have coalesced at the mid line yet have left traces of their original distinctness in the upper and lower notch the superoccipitals so have not yet invaded this mesial part nor have they reached the ascending edge of the fastgrowing exoccipitals eo Above the selvedge bounding the foramen magnum fm is seen the sinus canal sc and in the broad interspace between the super and exoccipitals the horizontal hsc and poste rior psc semicircular canals shine out and are seen to cross each other Externally and below the exoccipital region eo the elegant tympanic wings of the occipital carti lage form a thick crescentic selvedge In Plate LXXXIII fig 4 the postorbital aspect of the skull is given this is from a less mature specimen than that shown in figs 1  2 Here on each side above the optic nerves 2 and reaching to the olfactory crura 1 there is nothing but the laminar presphenoid for a great extent except membrane This membrane is becoming bony by extension of the orbital plates of the frontals f and inferoexternally we have the alisphenoids as which pass to some extent within the orbital plates Much of the alisphenoidal lamina is still cartilaginous but the left has an irregular ectosteal tract as1 between the inner selvedge and the fenestra asf Another bony tract as 2 lies above the foramen ovale 5 on the right side these two plates have coalesced In my former paper Plate vII fig 1 p 125 I showed that the alisphenoid independent of its postfrontal outgrowth had two bony centres in Strztthio and some other birds this appears to be the rule but the postfrontal ossicle is not present in some of the higher Passerine types  This is a reversed figure 5 L2 779MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND The space between the  posterior pterygoid processes  rp and the basitemporals bt is filled with soft stroma afterwards to be absorbed In Plate LXXXIII fig 5 a lateral view of the nasal labyrinth orbital septum and palatine is given which shows how loose and membranous is the connexion between the ascending orbital plate of the palatine and the prefrontal or pars plana p The continuity of this anteorbital portion of the nasal labyrinth with the upper ethmoid eth the aliseptal als and with the alinasal aln is clearly shown these parts will be better understood by reference to the sectional views and by this means we shall also come to a fuller understanding of the rest of the skull at this stage I shall describe the sections from before backwards and the first of these transversely vertical sections Plate LXXXIII fig 6 passes through the middle of the prenasal rod these sectional views are magnified from 8 to 16 diameters and are given in Plates LXXXIII  LXXXIV A section through the fore part of the beak Plate LXXXIII fig 6 passes through the broadest part of the prenasal cartilage which is seen to be more convex above than below it lies in the midst of a mass of fibrous stroma which is being rapidly converted into the solid part of the premaxillaries px these are thickest above have a cultrate edge laterally and have already a small marrow cavity A section made a little further back fig 7 shows the narrower cylindrical part of the prenasal rod and

formation of the inferior turbinals itb the section is made where the lateral nasal wall is deficient so that the aliseptal plate turns abruptly upwards and inwards to form the inferior turbinal scroll which has exactly two turns The nasals n and nasal processes of the premaxillaries surmount the labyrinth and leaving out other bony parts I have shown the relation of the palatine plates of the maxillaries maxillopalatines pmx to the thick base of the the septum nasi The 10th figure illustrates the structure of the ethmoid behind the anteorbital plates the ethmoidal roof ae is seen to be concave at the mid line and convex laterally the perpendicular plate pe to be thinnest at the middle and the basal part to have the same bulbous outline as the septum nasi Here surrounded by a web of fibrous tissue is seen the crescentic section of the rostrum rbs and on each side the shelving section of the palatines pa at their broadest part 780DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL The next section fig 11 passes through the interorbital fenestra iof Above is seen that part of the presphenoid ps which runs into the perpendicular ethmoid anteriorly it is only thickened above and the orbitosphenoidal regions os are merely fibrous The middle of the section is nothing but fibrethat of the fenestra and below the lower part of the presphenoid ps passes insensibly into the basisphenoid bs Here the c rostrum rbs is thicker and the palatines pa are cut through their thick but narrow pterygoid extremity Only the lower part of the next two sections is given in fig 12 the soft fore end of the pterygoids pg is cut through showing the enclosed cartilaginous pith in fig 13 the pterygoids pg are cut through where they interpose a cartilaginous plate between themselves and the  rostrum  rbs But the structure here indicated is better displayed in a section fig 14 16 diameters made through the basisphenoidal cartilage exactly below the exit of the optic nerves and immediately in front of the anterior clinoid wall Here the section of the coalesced trabeculze has a pyriform outline the narrow end being upwards this is en closed in much fibrous tissue Imbedded in this stroma is the rostrum rbs which is here much broader but less deep Outside the upturned part of the rostrum there is on each side a plate of hyaline cartilage ap then a synovial cavity then a similar plate of cartilage which is formed in the perichondrium of the pterygoid pg and out side its ectosteal tube This is very different from what obtains in the Lizard and in the Ostrich First Paper Plate viI fig 4 ap in them the anterior pterygoid processes are direct outgrowths of the roots of the trabecule and on their ends cartilage remains for articulation in the Lizard this is very apt to acquire a rudimentary distinctness as a feebly ossified epiphysis il both the Lizard and the Ostrich a cartilaginous plate appears on the cor responding part of the pterygoid Notwithstanding the different manner in which the basipterygoids of the Ostrich and the Lizard are ossified namely in the former from the extraneous  rostrum and in the latter from the symmetrical basisphenoidal ectostoses yet morphologically they cor respond This dyingout of the cartilaginous shaft of the basipterygoid outgrowth in typical birds is very instructive being an instance of morphological subdivision in a higher type of that which is continuous uncleft in a lower or more generalized form In the Fowl the rostrum insinuating itself between the basis cranii and the basi pterygoid articular plate becomes one with the true basis cranii and ossifying the inner face of the articular plate leaves the rest soft for articulation with the pterygoid The relation of the basitemporals to the basisphenoid is shown in section in Plate LXXXIII fig 4 which displays the postorbital region In Plate LXXXIV fig 1 the lower portion of this section is shown magnified 10 diameters This transversely vertical slice shows that the roots of the trabecule tr are pyriform  I here use indifferently Professor HUXLEYS term  basipterygoids and my older name  anterior ptery goid processes 781MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND in outline the broad part below where they enclose the pituitary fontanelle They are enclosed in a strong ectosteal sheath the origin of which I showed in Plate LXXXII fig 1 as being from the inner layer of the parosteal rostrum the section is taken where the grcfting first commenced The bulbous base of these trabecular roots passes directly behind into the foremost part of the investing mass where it encloses the posterior fontanelle Plate LXXXII fig 1 ybf and also into the posterior clinoid wall Plate LXXXII fig 3 pcl This section well shows the absence of all cartilage under the pituitary body and how the  sella turcica is finished below by extraneous fibrous bone as in the Osseous Fish The slice of cartilage seen on each side of the trabecular roots front view belongs proximally and below to the lingule Ig and further outwards to the posterior clinoid wall where it ascends into and becomes the root of the alisphenoidal lamina see Plate LXXXIII figs 2  3 als pcl There is no more

the bony matter which originally commenced in a fibrous tract breaks away again from the primordial skull and converts large tracts of fibrous tissue into bony wings Outside the bony deposit shown at

as with the upper wings to enclose a large space which becomes the anterior tympanic recess  atr Between the lower wings there is a central tract of bone and two open spaces and here at every available point the basitemporals bt are forming adhesions witlh the wings that grow out from the basisphenoid  posterior pterygoid processes  of former paper or more accurately  tympanic wings of basisphenoid Laterally the lower basisphe noidal outgrowths have not united with the basitemporals thlus there is a space em in which the eustachian tube is formed Between the basitemporals there is another space this becomes the back part of the commonl vestibule in which the eustachian tubes meet at the mid line The histology of the thick cushion of stroma which intervenes between the primordial skull and the socalled mucous membrane of the fauces is peculiar I have spoken of the aponeurotic bands in which the bony matter runs and must now mention that the  anterior tympanic recess atr and the eustachian passages em are at present full of a delicate gelatinogranular stroma of a consistence little more dense than the mucous tissue of the umbilical cord of the Mammal this soft sarcodal substance is soon absorbed to form the highly labyrinthic tympanic cavities 782DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL Horizontal sections through the pituitary fontanelle throw light upon the perplexing morphology of this regionof the skull The lowest of these Plate LXXXIII fig 15 shows the internal carotids ic coming up from below also the bony ring which surrounds the lower part of the pituitary body the bony matter of which has spread right and left ossifying a thick fibrous band f Behind these posterior pterygoid processes is an open space from which the gelatinous tissue has been removed showing the formation of the anterior tympanic recess atr and behind this space the section passes through the lower part of the  posterior clinoid wall pcl where it is growing up from the investing mass iv Between the moieties of this mass is seen the fore part of the  posterior basicranial fontanelle  pbf which is being walledin with bony matter Higher up fig 16 above the  recess the pituitary space is lined with a thin bony layer which has grown up from below whilst in front the bony substance the same as seen at pcl in fig 1 is just growing into the cloven posterior clinoid wall Behind this wall there is a thin layer of bony matter which has crept up from the posterior fontanelle fig 15 pbf Near the top fig 17 the thick cleft clinoid wall pcl is notched on each side and the bony matter has risen up in front on each side of the notch Another transversely vertical section Plate LXXXIV fig 2 shows in a very instruc tive manner the structure of the posterior

region in the various types of the Vertebrate skull and should be glad to work ic out independently if time allowed I will here suggest that the condition of these parts in the Fowls skull be compared with what is seen in the Marsupial Edentate and Insectivorous 3Mlammals Let it be noted here that the 1 anterior tympanic recess  is formed of fibrous bony wings which in the Mar supial grow directly from the alisphlienoidal centre and in the Insectivora Erinaceus from the basisphenoids In Man the  lingulhr  evidently borrow their bony matter from the extraneous basitemporals whilst ill the AMammalia generally although these splints are present yet as a rule the lingulse are ossified directly from the basisphenoid 783MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND by the lower tympanic lip of the

close behind the basitemporal in the broadest part of the basioccipital see Plate LXXXIII fig 1 bo bt This section and the next to be described well show the triple nature of the basioccipital and

This bone is separated from the periotic mass by a quantity of the same kind of gela tinous tissue as that which fills the tympanic cavity The space between the squamosal and the periotic mass is very large because of the deep angular fossa which runs along the outside of the anterior canal this fossa is shown in Plate LXXXII fig 9 and in Plate LXXXIII fig 2 as well as in this section it may be called the  upper periotic fossa Fifth StageHead of Embryo 15 lines long 2nd Day after Iatching The skull of the ripe chick Plate LXXXIV figs 612 is interesting in many respects it is profitable for comparison with the skull of the Fish the Reptile and the immature Mammal and looked at in its general form it comes much closer to that of the nearest congeners of the typical Fowl than the skull of the adult bird The types suggested by a view of the chicks skull are the HIemipodiine Pterocline and Columbine outliers of the Gallinaceous Family see Trans Zool Soc vol v plates 3438 the skull of the adult Fowl has receded greatly from that of its lower and 784DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL more generalized relatives on one hand and from its higher and more specialized con geners on the other The period of a week has sufficed for very great changes in chondrous and fibrous tracts and now is the best nick of time for catching the true form of many of the osseous territories although some have already lost their distinctness whilst others have not yet appeared The ectosteal tracts have set up  endostosis in the cartilage lying between their plates so that the true endoskeletal bones are being enlarged intrinsically as well as from the immediate fibrous layers Save in the instance of the early grafted para sphenoids the parosteal tracts splint bones are still altogether free from union with the endoskeleton whether bony or cartilaginous The hyaline cartilage furnishing the interspaces and headlands of the ectosteal plates has become very dense through the abundance of the cheeselike intercellular substance it is semitransparent when thick and for the most part of a lilac colour The splint bones are still fibrous but are beginning to become smooth through the fresh and fresh ossification of aponeurotic layers as a correlate of this exogenous growth the first deposit of bony matter is beginning to be absorbed in many directions so as to form diploe this is most advanced in the basitemporals and squamosals The drawings given of the ripe skull might with very little modification serve as dia grams to illustrate the structure of the skull in any bird above the Struthionidae with the  Preecoces they answer as to period but they correspond to nestlings of the Altrices at about the end of the first week after hatching The increased development of the occipital region is shown in Plate LXXXIV figs 610 The basioccipital figs 6  10 bo has nearly obliterated the notochord and the bolny substance is spreading both laterally and backwards into the cartilaginous condyle anteriorly fig 10 it has obliterated the sphenooccipital synchondrosis at the mid line The form of the basioccipital is reptilian lozengeshaped above fig 10 and mlammalian almost oblong below fig 6 The exoccipitals eo are growing into large wings which reach up to the mastoid epiotic region externally and above and approach the superoccipitals at the foramen magnum fig 9 inside fig 7 they are still quite distinct from the opisthotic op and both outside fig 8 and inside fig 10 they have enclosed the anterior and posterior condy loid foramen 9 and the vagusforamen 8 On the outer occipital plane fig 9 the exoccipitals trespass extensively upon the mastoid portion of the periotic cartilage fig 9 hsc psc the true mastoid epiotic has not yet appeared The superoccipitals fig 4 so are fused together in their lower twothirds and form now a large shield of bone internally fig 7 they enclose the whole crown of the huge anterior semicircular canal asc and the sinus canal sc which burrows along the outer face of the arch and escapes near the inferior angle figs 7  9 The three periotic ectosteal plates which have at present made their appearance are all inside the cranial cavity fig 7 These are the front prootic ro the hinder opis thotic op and the small representative of the great otic wing of the osseous Fish MDCCCLXIX 5 M 785IMR W   PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND the pterotic pto this latter bone can now be seen in the  lateral cerebellar fossa on its front face  A deep fossa partly subdivides the periotic mass from the occipital ring on the inside fig 3 op eo but the osseous centres are here not quite accurate landmarks of mor phological regions as the four periotic bones fail to wallin the zfpper outer and lower portions of the auditory labyrinth this is a reptilian state of things The prootic pro is the earliest and as a correlate of this by far the most potent osseous growth of the four The crested fore edge of the periotic mass helps in front of and above the labyrinth to enclose the cerebral mass but the lateness of the small pterotic allows this cranial wing both in the Bird and in the Mammal see HUXLEY op cit p 245 fig 97 PrO which shows this part in the skull of a Beaver to be ossified by the early prootic whereas in the Osseous Fishes the massive cranial wall is very greatly indebted to the pterotic which is in them the largest of the periotic bones The prootic of the Fowl Plate LXXXIV fig 7 pro besides the scooped anterior crest the front of which is notched for the trigeminal nerve 5

passes in its posterior fork td the other end of the arch here it encloses the ovoidal pterotic plate pto The opisthotic fig 7 op is now a semnielliptical wedge of bone with its straight margin separated by a very narrow line of cartilage from the prootic and its crescentic margin lying as a bank in front of the occipitootic fossa the line of separation between the opisthotic and the exoccipital eo is a very narrow band of cartilage The complex basisphenoidal region has now only one osseous centre which mace rated away from the rest of the cranium forms a most perplexing bone to

This fourth periotic bone the socalled  mastoid in the Fish of CUVIER and OWEN was first determined by me in a note to Professor HUXLEY who spoke very cautiously about it at first see his I Elem Comp Anat p 188 In my former paper I described this bone which is very common in the Birdclass as the epiotic see Plates xiXII ep but it is too far forward for that bone the true  epiotic see First Paper Plate vii figs 4  8 op is formed over the crown of the posterior semicircular canal My error of taking the little pterotic for the epiotic misled me in naming the latter which I sLpposed to be an otter ectosteal plate to the opisthotic element and in the First Paper it will be seen that the letters op indicate both a postero internal true opisthotic and a superoexternal true mastoid or epiotic patch of bone I am indebted to Pro fessor HUXLLEY for leading me to see which was the true epiotic then the pterotic unconsciously assumed its true name 78GDEVELOPMENT OF THE SKILL OF THE COMMON FOWL

plate of fibrous tissue far away from the craniofacial axis and ready to lay hold on the fore spurs of the palatines fig 6 vpa 5M2 787MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND The nasal branch of the ophthalmic has left its burrow in the hinder part of the septum nasi which has bridged it over both above and below The rather strong septum nasi fig 7 sn ends in a rounded manner in front and still retains as a rostral process the fastdiminishing prenasal or snoutcartilage pn The swelling alinasal folds aln with their internal turbinal plate alt are best seen in fig 8 and in it also can be seen the  pars plana pp or lower part of the prefrontal plate The outer nasal wall Plate LXXXIV fig 6 onw and the prenasal bar pn are clearly seen from below in the fore part of the palate The palatines figs 6  8 pa the pterygoids pg the quadrate q and the stapes st have all made a great approach to the adult condition The pterygoids and palatines are well ossified but the former have a cartilaginous cup for articulation with the qua drate and a meniscoid plate fig 11 py for articulation with a similar disk on the anterior pterygoid process ap rbs The meniscus which articulates the pterygoid to the basipterygoid facet is composed of typical hyaline cartilage fig 12 200 diam this is separated from another tract of cartilage in immediate contact with the bonecells towards the fissure the cells are very much flattened those in contact with the endosteal deposit are baggy simple cartilage cells Hence it is evident that this facet of the pterygoid is a proper segment of carti lage and not a mere remnant of the main rod such as is seen on the quadrate end of the pterygoid The Fowl agrees with the Struthionidae in having no mesopterygoid contrary to what I once supposed see Zool Trans vol

fibrous skeleton has been described in connexion with the basisphenoidal stock on which it is grafted the splints are easily separable from the primordial cranium One pair only of these have coalesced at the mid line these are the premaxillaries fig 6 px these have already become truly Gallinaceous although in a generalized manner they have the  habit of those of the adults of the lower types In figs 6  7 it is shown how these bones are causing as it were the absorption of the axis pn on which they were modelled  This is in conformity with what is so common in the buildingup of the skull and face in the Warmblooded Tertebratathe  hoarding and the scaffolding  being formed subsequently to the proper walls and gates which walls and gates have to be taken down to a great extent to let the hoarding and the scaffolding stand alone 788DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMM3ON FOWL The premaxillaries anterior to their mesial coalescence are normally ichthyic with the exception that each bone developes a palatine process fig 6 as in the Mammal But the maxillary figs 68 mx of the Fowl above that of all other Birds is ichthyic in a very remarkable manner it is a perfect  os mystaceum and if the papillae of the horny beak covering the premaxillaries may be considered as in truth they are to be potential teeth then the maxillary is absolutely edentulous as in ordinary Teleostean Fishes it is a very small delicate style of bone and as in the Fish has a double head the anterior division articulating with the premaxillary and the posterior with the pala tine as in the Fish the posterior process is turned backwards The manner in which the Bird looks both ways backwards to the Fish and forwards to the Mammal is well shown in the maxillary In those low untypical Rodents the Leporidse the dentary portion of the maxillary is abortively developed in front and the second division of the palatine part of the Fowls maxillary reappears in them as a narrow backwardly placed palatine plate In most Mammals the palatine plate is trun cated anteriorly to form the posterior boundary of the  anterior palatine foramen  but in some for instance the Pangolin Manis and the Hedgehog Erinaceus the palatine plate is sharply wedgedin anteriorly between the dentary and palatine processes of the premaxillaries exactly as in the Fowl Plate LXXXIV fig 6 px mx The retral posterior palatine plates of the Fowls maxillaries maxillopalatines of HUXLEY are very thin scarcely reach the vomer v are fibrous and are less developed than in any family except the Picinae where they only just appear mesiad of the inner edge of the palatine see HUXLEY  On the Classification of Birds Zool Proc 1867 pp 448450 figs 30  31 mxp The rest of the maxillary of the Fowl is mere style a zygomatic process and ends free in the upper lip having the jugal j mounted on and overlapping it exactly as in those Teleostean Fishes which possess a jugal The jugal Plate LXXXIV figs 6  8 j is similar in form and size to the zygomatic process of the maxillary and is less than the quadratojugal qj which finishes the fixingbar to the quadrate q The quadratojugal like the rest of the facial splints continues distinct from its surroundings The nasals fig 8 n overlie the frontal part of the ethmoid imperfectly as in Struthious B13irds they have a concave semielliptic margin anteriorly this is bounded by an upper process which outlies the nasal process of the premaxillary and a descendinlg facial wallplate which articulates with the pre maxillary and maxillary below this lower process is a typically ornithic structure and is aborted in the Struthionide see First Paper Plates vIxvI n The lacrymal figs 6  8 1 has a large superorbital and a thickish twisted ante orbital plate these two parts are distinct bones in the

gene rally and show a large square plate on the inside of the skull fig 7 thus supplementing the wallplate of the prootic pro and the alisphenoid as The squamosals of the Fowl do not show the bifurcate character so well as in the other families of Birds and of several mammalian typesfor instance Cavia Arvicola Lepus c It is here fig 8 sq that the squamosal overlaps the whole side of the skull over the piers of both the mandibular and the hyoid arches thus whilst it is the counterpart of the principal  supratemporal of the Ganoid Fish it extends over the region occupied by the  pterotic the posterior portion of the squamosal has a separate counterpart in the Lacertilia just as in them the descending portion of the lacrymal is separately ossified In the mandible however the splint bones are as numerous in the Bird as in the Lizard but the Fowl is exceptional in possessing no coronoid piece The dentary Plate LXXXIV figs 7  8 d runs backwards almost to the articular facet the splenial fig 7 sp is oblong equidistant from the ends of the ramus and hides half the Meckelian rod The surangular figs 7  8 su is more external than internal the angular a belongs equally to both faces being laid on below it flanks the long posterior angular process of the endoskeletal ray Sixth StageChickens about 3 Weeks old At first sight there appeared to be but little alteration except general advancement of the ossification in this stage but the specimens examined were feebly grown and had died in a somewhat atrophied condition They yielded two new pairs of ossific centresthe postfrontals pf and the epiotics epwhich I had never before succeeded in demonstrating in the Fowl these are shown in Plate LXXXIV figs 13  14 I am rather inclined to suppose that these bony patches were more distinct on account of the arrested growth of the chickens at any rate they are very instructive and the Fowl is thus seen to agree with the Osseous Fish and with many families of its own Class in the separate formation of these bones In my former Paper p 129 I stated that the post frontal of the Bird is an ichthyic bone the socalled postfrontal of the Lizard being a postorbital subcutaneous scale In this as in many other respects it is not the Lizard but the Teleostean Fish which is the proper forerunner of the Bird The epiotics fig 13 ep are small foursided ectosteal plates formed over the arch of the posterior canal and having a somewhat indistinct and very transitory separateness from the exoccipital eo 790DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL Seventh StageChicken 2 Months old In this much more advanced condition of the skull many of the sutures still remain the two new bones described in the last stage have already lost their distinctness and two new pairs of osseous centres have appeared In Plate LXXXV fig 1 the left half of the skull is shown from the inside and the orbital septum not touched by the saw is shown on its right side this figure is mag nified 3 diameters Altogether the structures have begun to acquire that massiveness which characterizes the skull of the Fowl equally with that of the Ostrich The delicately toothed sutures above between the roofbones and the narrow synchondrosial tracts in the primordial skull make this a very fitting stage for comparison with the skull of a Reptile The notochord is now fairly vanished from the basioccipital bo but the vertical dimple in the condyle is a permanent remembrancer of what once existed the bony mass which has swallowed it up and replaced it is now a massive lozenge capped with cartilage behind It is surmounted on each side by the exoccipital eo the smooth faced wedgelike opisthotic op and by the posteroinferior margin of the manysided prootic pro Crowning all these there is the large elegantly sculptured superoccipital so half of which is occupied by the arch of the great anterior canal asc which is margined by the sinus fossa and canal sc The prootic pro is seen to be connected by its wallpiece to the fourcornered alisphenoid as a narrow synchondrosis uniting them the latter has not lost its fenestra asf The pterotic ptois seen in the an terior aspect of the lateral cerebellar fossa There is now a basisphenoid bs as massive as the basioccipital and containing between its two clinoid walls acl pcl the elegant cupshaped cavity for the in fundibulum pierced below for the internal carotids ic In front of this cup the basisphenoid forms a thick low wall above which the optic nerves diverge Beneath the sphenooccipital synchondrosis the thick skullbase is made doubly thick by the massive basitemporal bt In front of this superaddition the basal part of the equally extra neous rostrum rbs is capped on each side by the basipterygoid cartilaginous meniscus ap The presphenoidal region ps is still soft and the basisphenoid and perpendicular ethmoid are a long distance apart below but along the thick upper edge of the pre sphenoidal cartilage there are now two pairs of bony platesthe fibrous representatives of the orbitosphenoids The hinder pair evidently correspond to the ectosteal bars that appear behind the fenestra in the huge orbitosphenoids of the Lizard but as there are no cartilaginous alae minores the ectosteal plate degenerates into a thickish  parostosis and then grafts itself upon the indistinct orbitosphenoidal lips of the presphenoid The addi tional pair are very common in Birds and I have mentioned the existence of two centres in the Emu in my former paper p 137 where they are described as part of the pre 791MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND sphenoid they do cause its ossification The anterior bone os 1 is irregularly oval the larger posterior piece os2 is somewhat square in shape and is fast wedgedin between the posterosuperior margin of the presphenoid and the supero anterior margin of the alisphenoid these ossicles are still quite separable from the pre sphenoid although afterwards they set up ossification in it If the narrowest part of the tract of cartilage above the interorbital fenestra were quite asborbed it would then be plainly seen what should be considered the true mor phological boundaries of the perpendicular ethmoid pe eth This does take place in some birds as in the Cormorant the Sunbittern and the Stiltplover and then the cleft also runs across to the common optic foramen so that the small presphenoid is completely severed from the ethmobasisphenoidal band below In the Bird the pre sphenoid is to be regarded as a wedge with its sharp end below cleaving the basal region where the basisphenoid and vertical ethmoid meet this is a remarkable modifi cation of the Vertebrate skull The frontal and perpendicular regions of the ethmoid are not separately ossified as in the Struthionide First Paper p 127 et seg but the ectosteal plates right and left work upwards through the frontal plate At this stage the ethmoid is an irregularly oblong plate finished in front but deficient above below and behind The notched front margin is the posterior boundary of the great cranio facial cleft In the figure the isthmus of cartilage is seen as cut through below there is a small hook of cartilage the remnant of the lower boundary of the  fenestra  of the fourth stage this piece partly lies in the grooved fore end of the rostrum The position relation and advanced development of the three great splints f p sg that wallin the skull are shown in Plate LXXXV fig 1 anteriorly the frontal is seen to retire at the mid line thus exposing the ethmoid above An outer side view of this stage of the skull is shown in Plate LXXXV fig 2 where the superoccipital is seen to be still quite separate and the epiotic ep nearly coalesced with the exoccipital In the large sulcus behind the oblique cartilaginous selvedge of the prootic pro is seen a wedgelike plate of bone pto part of which appears onl the outstanding edge of the exoccipital in front of and below the remnant of the epiotic suture This is the pterotic the first ectosteal plate of which appears in the front and outer part of the  lateral cerebellar fossa fig 1 pto its subsequtent developmenlt is by endostosis at this stage it has worked to the outer surface and here it appears bethind the prootic pro in front of and external to the epiotic ep and above the opisthotic op No one familiar with the skull of the Cod Perch or Halibut will fail to see how  On this ground a parostosis and an ectostosis meet and nothing but the history of the development of the parts could have given any clue to the matter similarly in the Mammalia the  cornua sphenoidalia or mesopterygoids crop up again as mere late ossifications of membranous tracts of the pterygopalatine arcade and instructively as to the case of the Birds double orbitosphenoids in Man the mesopterygoids are double on each side 792DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL true the geograp7hical relations of this little bony territory are to those of the great ichthyic pterotic  The coalescence of the epiotic with the exoccipital is a Reptilian character but there is a tendency towards that affinity of the periotic centres for each other that we see in the Mammalia inasmuch as the prootic pterotic and opisthotic unite together before they coalesce with the surrounding bones Yet this is not very perfectly maintained for the opisthotic begins to coalesce with the exoccipital about the same time that it loses its distinctness from the prootic see Plate LXXXV fig 3 op eo The formation of the tympanic cavity in the Bird is extremely instructive the space itself is the remnant of the primordial cleft between the first and second poststomal arches this stage illustrates it well In Plate LXXXV fig 2 the occipitootic mass is seen from the outside in fig 3 part of the same is shown but the skull was tilted so as to give an inferolateral view it is magnified one half more than fig 2 The floor of the eardrum instead of being formed primarily of the inferior periotic lip and secondarily of the tympanic bone as in the Mammal is here altogether formed by the basitemporal splints This massive bone bt underlies the eustachian tube fig 1 eu the  anterior tympanic recess and the main part of the chamber The great wings prp that grow widely from the lingular bud of cartilage form a roof and side wall to the anterior recess the prootic pro forms the roof of the main chamber and the exoccipital eo by its large crescentic wing forms the posterior wall Where the prootic and exoccipital meet above the opisthotic op there is formed a very large aircavitythe upper tympanic recess  mtr the two eardrums communicate with each other through the diploe that lies between these upper recesses The outer part of the opisthotic is seen on the inner side of the drumcavity as an oblique bar separating the fenestra ovalis from the fenestra rotunda Above the opisthotic cochlear bar has coalesced with the exoccipital fig 3 below and in front it is still separate from the prootic The outer notched edge of the prootic from which the squamosal has been removed is still soft at its selvedge and a synchondrosial tract is seen running between this bone and the crescentic wing of the exoccipital Halfway between the outer selvedge of the prootic and the fenestra ovalis there is seen a thickened rib of bone which passes directly forwards and is terminated by an oblique subconcave oval facet this is the point of articulation of the inner head or prootic facet of the os quadratum Plate LXXXV fig 8 g pr the other facet of the quadrate is much larger and articulates with the squamosal fig 8 sqf This facet for the quadrate lies a little behind the great out growths of the basisphenoid prp This articular facet marks the great difference between the Fowls skull and that of Birds generally for this is the primordial point of attachment which was once lost Plate LXXXI figs 1 2 5  5a q and then  Professor HUXLEY would refer the epiphysis on the end of the outstanding occipitoperiotic mass in the Lizard to this element and he is undoubtedly right the same centre keeps

tympanic ring of the Mammal In the Fowl and in the true Galli naceve  Alectoromorphe Huxley I find scarcely a trace of ossification in the tendinous ring surrounding the membrana tympani In the Peafowl however a tympanic appears which is ornithically unique although many birds have a chain of tympanics this is formed in the posterior part of the shallow  meatus externus  see Memoir on Balceniceps p 316 and therefore answers to the posterior part of the bony meatus of the Mammal and lying as it does directly beneath the posterior process of the squamosal  supratemporal it may represent tlie ichthyic  opercular splintbone Eighth StageChickens 3 Months old The parts especially worthy of notice in this stage are the occipital periotic and posterior sphenoidal regions Plate LXXXV figs 47 fig 6 magnified 3 diameters and the others twice the natural size The degree of coalescence of parts at this stage is illustrated by figures of the skull basin All but the parasphenoidal splints which are so early engrafted upon the skull base are separable by maceration only the symmetrical premaxillaries and dentaries have united at the mid line the former very early and the latter soon after hatching In the regions figured several of the smaller sutures are closed and those that are still open are mostly narrow so that the true shape of the bony territory is well shown An upper and a lower notch still attest the original symmetry of the superoccipital Plate LXXXV figs 57 so The exoccipital eo has completely absorbed the epiotic which is now a mere region ep The basioccipital

the remnant of the epiotico occipital suture is gone and also the whole of that surrounding the outer part of the  I do not wish to push this doctrine of exact representatives or true homologues too

are absent here the tensor muscle which arises behind the  parotic bar and above and behind the head of the qutadrate sends its tendon between the forks of the  suprastapedial which is bilobate as in the Fowlto be inserted into the upper edge of the extrastapedial at its free end the  infrastapedial  is shorter than in the Fowl I here use these terms provisionally as my researches into the structure of these parts in the Batrachia have satisfied me that these prefixces should have been set before the term  incuLdal 798DEVELOPMiENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL against which the aliseptal fold terminates as a free lamina closely tied by fibrous tissue to the nervebridge Besides the proper nasal floor we have here a true bony palatine floor for here the palatine plates of the maxillaries mxpmx are at their fullest deve lopment and are expanded where they nearly meet each other and have the vomer v wedged in between them below A section through this part of the skull in the Turtle Chelone in the Pangolin Manis or in the Cat Pelis would show precisely the same disposition of these parts the vomer wedging itself in between the palatine plates of the maxillaries which fail where the vomer crops out to meet each other at the mid line At this part the upper and lower crura of the nasal n are cut through the dentary part of the premaxillary dpx is becoming thin the maxillary is at its greatest breadth and the palatine is growing thicker The feeble ichthyic maxillaries mx instead of protecting the side of the face are seen to be almost entirely at its base The next section fig 4 is taken where the large chink is seen in the upper view fig 11 between ale and aln here the aliseptal fold ends exactly where it has given off the inturned inferior turbinal coil it this coil has exactly two turns Below the posterior edge of the nasal wall nw is seen curving a little upwards where it touches the nasal nerve nn This section also passes through the maxillovomerine floor pmx v and here the nasal processes of the premaxillaries npx are flat and the dentary pro cesses dpx are very small the saw has passed through the nasals n close in front of their bifurcation The next section fig 5 cuts through the nasals behind their bifurcation and just this sectionnamely the zygomatic process and the posterior edge of the palatine plate As this section is taken behind the lateral chink the nasal wall nw reappears below the inturned inferior turbinal outgrowth itb The nasal nerves nn are seen turning downwards and by their close contiguity they have aborted the septum nasi at this part in many Birds especially the Raptores the posteroinferior angle of the septum is almost sawn off by these nerves Another branch is seen to perforate the winged top of the septum close below the nasal processes of the premaxillaries nyx In the next section fig 6 a front view is given of the end of the inferior turbinal itb and of the anterior face of the upper turbinal ntb this section passes through the craniofacial isthmus which is still surmounted by the flat ends of the nlasal processes of the premaxillaries npx On each side the nasals n form the roofbones which are flanked by the lacrymals 1 The upper turbinal utb like the lower is seen to be an involution or outgrowth of the nasal wall nw and here at this point they lie one above the other this is also shown in the lateral view in fig 10 In the next section fig 7 the inferior turbinal is cut away and the interior of the upper turbinal ztb is exposed Although appearing as a distinct outgrowth ante riorly fig 6 utb the upper turbinal is a mere bagged condition of the aliethmoidal lamina ale further back see figs 7  10 799MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND A section through the fore part of the ethmoid fig 8 eti pe showing the sharp front edge of the perpendicular plate gives a front view of the back wall of the nasal labyrinth in this figure the outer bones are not given This large back wall is the prefrontal plate and much of it answers to the pars plana of anthropotomy In this section the upper turbinal Ztb is seen to be at its posterior end an outgrowth from the posterior wall of the nasal labyrinth so that although it is a mere swelling bag at its middle figs 7  10 yet it is a fixed outgrowth from the walls of the labyrinth at both ends If the inner view of the left half of the cartilagi nous labyrinth fig 10 be compared with the front view of its back wall from which the turbinals have been cut away leaving their roots it will be seen that the inferior tur binal iib is an outgrowth of the pars plana posteriorly and that its root there is continuous with that of the upper turbinal utb Here there is no differentiation of a middle turbinal except a small lamina ntb which grows upwards from the inner side of the root of the lower turbinal in this respect the Galline like most other birds are inferior to the Struthionidae First Paper Plates vIIIxiv mtb which show a rudiment of those outgrowths which are so largely developed from the front face of the Mammalian  pars plana In this section the nasal nerves fig 8 nn are seen entering the labyrinth close below the roots of the cartilaginous aliethmoid ale whilst the smaller olfactory crura 1 enter between the widening part of the perpendicular ethmoid pe and the convex margin of the crescentic root of the upper turbinal tttb clos e above a little hornlike process growing from the superointernal angle of the pars plana pp The rostrum of the basisphenoid rbs reaches so far forwards as to underlie the cultrate fore edge of the perpendicular ethmoid A section fig 9 made through the most solid part of the ethmomost solid part of the ethmoid displays much that is instructive The nasal processes of the premaxillaries npx are reduced to delicate flat styles the nasals n are still of considerable breadth and overlie the wedgelike fore ends of the frontals f The lacrymals 1 send out here their broad superorbital plate and grow downwards into an imperforate styloid anteorbital process on the inside of each lacrymal in the recess between this bone and the nasal labyrinth is seen the pyriform nasal gland ng The huge perpendicular ethmoid pe has here grown out largely into the aliethmoidal wings ale only leaving the very edge soft from which a narrow isthmus grows downwards outside the nasal nerve connecting the  broad top of the ethmoid with the superoexternal angle of the anteorbital prefrontal plate This flat smooth subconvex sheet of cartilage the anteorbital is oblong in general form and has sinuous edges the inner of which although quite distinct from yet lies close to the perpendicular plate In the Fowl even to old age it is soft but in many birds it is ossified and is extremely apt to form bony adhesion with the per pendicular plate Below the anteorbitals the median plate becomes suddenly thin swelling a little below where it lies in the grooved rostrum rbs In this section the thick outer and the sharp orbital parts of the palatines are seen 800DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE COMMON FOWL the latter processes lie near the rostrum and are enveloped in the same stroma this projecting part forms an imperfect septum between the middle nasal passages mn which open into each other below compare this figure with Plate LXXXIII fig 10ye pa rst The whole nasal labyrinth is continuous the prefrontal wall the outer wall the tur binals and the alae nasi are all developed from that tract of the primordial skull which curls downwards in front of the pituitary space into the frontal wall of the embryonic skull Plate LXXXI figs 1  2 This free growth of cartilage into so many morphological territories is correlative to the simplicity of the tissue which rises but a step or two beyond protoplasm is ready to be metamorphosed into any other skeletal tissue and yet serves as a persistent ske leton to many parts especially those of the nasal labyrinth The quadrate end of the pterygoid is lined with flatcelled hyaline cartilage Plate LXXXVI fig 12 c and the contiguous osseous tissue o is formd by endosteal meta morphosis of more swollen cells When the cartilagecells of the articular facet are viewed endwise fig 13 c they are seen to have an oval outline The meniscoid facet has not changed except in size since the time of hatching Tenth StageFowls several years old By the time the young Fowl is a year old most of the cranial sutures are completely closed and then year by year the skull becomes more and more dense the periosteal layers fillingin every vacant space not needed for the transmission of vessels and nerves Thus in the skull of an aged bird Plate LXXXVII figs 410 the occipital otic pos terior and anterior sphenoidal and the ethmoidal regions have become one continuous bone with the old landmarks all removed and scarcely a sign left of its once highly complex condition This state of things for a bird is quite normal and although carried to a very high degree in the Fowl yet in some more typical birds the obliteration of all signs of the once composite condition of the skull is still more perfect The present paper is linked on to the first by the description of the skull in the aberrant Struthionidae Tinaminme or Dromseognathae in those birds there is some falling away from what is typically struthious and some approach to what we have here in the higher Gallinae In the skull however the Tinamous wherein they diverge from the Ostrichtribe do not equally approach the Gallinae but rather show affinity to the Charadriomorphous types This however is not all for the Tinamous have a tincture of the Reptilian nature in them and whilst the sutures close very perfectly in the Ostrich as in the Fowl and other typical birds in them several of the most important of those landmarks remain throughout life see First Paper pp 174178 Plate xv MdDCCCLXIX 5 o 801MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND In the side view of the skull of an old male Plate LXXXVII fig 1 we see how largely the face has gained upon the skull as compared with what had obtained in the ripe chick Plate LXXXIV figs 69 where the face had the feebleness seen in the Sandgrouse Syrrhaptes A zygomatic process has grown downwards from the squamosal Plate LXXXVII fig 4 sq and this has formed a bridge over the lower part of the temporal fossa by coales cence with the postfrontal pf The fenestre in the posterior orbital wall are all filled up and the olfactory opening 1 is merely large enough for the nerve whereas it once lay in a sheet of membrane In Plate LXXXVII fig 4 a trace of the interorbital space ios still exists but in another specimen fig 8 the periosteal layers of bone have completely obliterated it in the same figure wvhich shows the inside of the cranial cavity and the left side of the orbital septum it is seen that the rostrum rbs has completely coalesced with the base of the perpendicular ethmoid pe and that the upper part of the ethmoid eth has stopped its ossification at the craniofacial isthmus The nasal labyrinth which is nof displayed in these figures is but little altered since the first winter Plate LXXXVI but four small endosteal patches have appeared Plate LXXXVII fig 10 in front of the ethmoid eth One of these is in the isthmus another close in front of it is formed in the posterosuperior margin of the septum nasi sn and on each side of these there is one formed in that thick bridge of cartilage which protects the upper branch of the nasal nerve Plate LXXXVI fig 14 nn In the late arrested condition of the nasal ossicles the Fowl differs much from a large number of Birds especially the aerial Desmognathae and many also of the Schizognathae are less Reptilian in this respect than the Fowlt The nasal bones figs 4  6 n have coalesced posteriorly with the frontals f but the latter are wedgelike and divergent in front and thus expose the upper surface of the ethmoid

are removed and show the fenestra ovalis and fenestra rotunda fo fr on the surface a bristle is shown as passing along the tortuous canal for the internal carotid artery The figures as compared with what is seen in Aerial Birds show what every one is familiar with in the natural skull namely the nontypical coarseness and strength of the whole skull and face Concluding Remarks Having thus with as much expedition and brevity as I have been competent to run through the ten arbitrary but not unnatural stages in the morphological history of the Fowls head I would conclude by hinting at the importance of the various isomorphisms displayed by the skull and face of this one type in its stages of growth I have described it iTpwards but my long and really anxious labour has been in the opposite direction the stages were traced from that of the old bird downwards to that of the chick of the 4th day of incubation Whilst at work I seemed to myself to have been endeavouring to decipher a palim psest and one not erased and written upon again just once but five or six times over Having erased as it were the characters of the culminating typethose of the gaudy Indian birdI seemed to be amongst the sombre Grouse and then towards incubation  In a Junglefowl Gallus bandciva which I dissected for Professor HUXLEY the skull was much more fibrous and less dense than in the tame Fowl it was more like that of the Pheasant 5 o2 803MR W K PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND the characters of the Sandgrouse and Hemipod stood out before me Rubbing these away in my downward work the form of the Tinamou looked me in the face then the aberrant Ostrich seemed to be described in large archaic characters a little while and these faded into what could just be read off as pertaining to the Seaturtle whilst underlying the whole the Fish in its simplest Myxinoid form could be traced in mor phological hieroglyphics I have but little used the suggestions of comparison which have almost been burden some at times but other monographs must follow and that of the Osseous Fish which I hope to offer next will show how gentle and gradual are the metamorphic changes by which the skull and face of a Vertebrate animal grow into harmony with the most diverse conditions and habits of life DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATESt PLATE LXXXI First StageHead of Enmbryo from beak to occiput 3 lines long 4th Day

remark that what Dr GTNTHER Phil Trans 1867 p 599 Plate xxvi fig 2 has shown to be peculiar in Hatteria a modern Rhynchosaurian namely the articulation of the pterygoids with the vomers is normal in the young Bird in most of the Orders the cc mesopterygoid which is at first a mere extension forwards of the pterygoid articulates with the corre sponding vomerine fork thus the palatines are thrust aside from each other and from the mid line This being the case there is no difficulty about the separated palatines of Hatteria see Dr GtNIETHERS note to p 599 for separated palatines coexist with distinct palatomaxillaries in certain Birdsfor instance in Emberiza and Cardinalis t The cartilage is tinted of a lilac colour and the cartilagebones ochreyellow the membranebones and fibrous tracts

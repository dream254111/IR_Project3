j100128,Columbia Law Review,1110467,Corporate Privilege against Self Incrimination,i246292,CORPORATE PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION In I904 an author so conservative and exact of statement as Professor Wigmore wrote in his treatise on evidence 1 It is also plain on the other hand that a corporation when discovery is sought from it as such is to be equally protected from disclosure so far as it is capable of committing a criminal act In 1910 Judge Lacombe in the United States Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York held squarely that a cor poration Cannot avail of the provisions of the fifth amendment to the Constitution which declares that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself    2 And in January I9II Judge Hand in the same court upheld the validity of a subpcena directed to no human being but solely to a coporation and commanding it to produce books and papers before the Grand Jury in a proceeding against itself8 He dis posed of respondents insistence that by a long series of prece dents corporations are persons within the Bill of Rights and that at least if a part of the people to be protected by the Fourth Amendment they are persons within the Fifth by stating These are considerations solely for the Supreme Court they do not concern a Judge of first instance The process by which Professor Wigmores dictum has been temporarily at least destroyed and every vestige of torporate immunity against self incrimination swept away in the short in terval between I904 and I9II presents a curious intermingling of motives purposes and reasoning The causal psychology of the change is twofoldthe revolt against what a recent writer has called coddling the criminal4 and a revolt against corporate immunity and privilege generally It may be that each of these motives can be justified As to the former Professor Wigmores profound consideration of the policy of the privilege against in crimination weighing judicially its advantages and its evils leads 14 Wigmore Evidence 3II6 In re American Sugar Refining Co 19gI 178 Fed Io9 In re Bornn Hat Company g191 184 Fed 506 4Coddling the Criminal by C C Nott Jr I9II o07 Atlantic Monthly I64COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW him to the conclusion that The privilege therefore should be kept within limits the strictest possible5 As to the latter the general attack on corporate abuse may be justly entitled to use the destruction of this historic privilege as a weapon With the justification of these motives we are not here however primarily concerned We refer to them but to furnish explanation not excuse for the reasoning that has prompted the change and curiously warped the rules of law on this subject out of all possi bility of logical arrangement until the final word shall have been spoken by the Supreme Court and order once more restored out of chaos The case which gave rise to this confusion was the socalled Hale case6 Mr Hale was Secretary of the McAndrews  Forbes Company He was served with a subpoena duces tecum co produce before the Grand Jury books and papers of the corporation in a proceeding against the corporation under the Anti Trust Law of July 2 I890 He refused to obey the subpoena asserting both his own privilege and the privilege of the corporation His plea of personal privilege was held to be bad both by the Circuit Court and by the Supreme Court because of the Immunity Act of Feb I9 I903 which the Supreme Court had held afforded the witness complete protection against prosecution The decision of the lower court did not really involve the questions with which we are here concerned and held that the subpoena was so general as to amount to an unreasonable search that it therefore violated the rights of Hale under the Fourth Amendment guaranteeing him against unreasonable searches and seizures but that he would not be discharged because of the unwillingness of the court to interfere with the action of the Judge of concurrent jurisdiction who had made the contempt order and in view of the fact that an appeal was to be taken and that he would be released on bail pending the appeal7 In the Supreme Court the actual decision of the court went no further than that Hale could not plead his own privilege because of the immunity statute and could not plead the corporations privilege because the privilege was personal to the witness only and the witness could not plead the privilege of a third party even though that third party was a corporation of which he was an officer 4 Wigmore Evidence 3Io2 In re Hale I9o5 139 Fed 496 Hale v Henkel 19o6 201 U S 43 7Brown v Valker 1896 i6I U S 59I 446SELF INCRIMINATION There were handed down however four opinions in all the opinion of the court by Mr Justice Brown concurring opinions by Justices McKenna and Harlan and a dissenting opinion by Mr Justice Brewer From each of these opinions considerable com tort and considerable perturbation has been drawn by counsel on both sides of the controversy And the confusion resultant from the decision is traceable to the blind following of excerpts from the opinions not always wholy definite in themselves and stand ing alone not always wholly consistent with other parts of the opinions A careful study of those opinions is the necessary basis for consideration of the present status of the question Mr Justice Brown first holds that Hale could not plead his own privilege under the Fifth Amendment because of the im munity guaranteed to him by the act of Feb 25 1903 He writes The interdiction of the Fifth Amendment operates only where a witness is asked to incriminate himself   But if the criminality has already been taken away the Amendment ceases to apply He then considers the immunity statute and holds it to be an absolute immunity to Hale The opinion then continues But it is further insisted that while the immunity statute may protect individual witnesses it would not protect the corpo ration of which the appellant was the agent or representative This is true but the answer is that it was not designed to do so The right of a person under the Fifth Amendment to refuse to incriminate himself is purely a personal privilege of the witness It was never intended to permit him to plead the fact that some third person might be incriminated by his testimony even though he were the agent of such person It should be noted that Mr Justice Brown here does not say that the corporation has no privilege He says merely that the witness cannot assert the corporations privilege in refusing to answer orally Then follows The question whether a corporation is aperson within the meaning of this Amendment really does not arise except perhaps where a corporation is called upon to answer a bill of discovery since it can only be heard by oral evidence in the person of some of its agents or employes This refers obviously to oral testimony and not to the pro duction of documents 447COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW An officer of a corporation subpoenaed to testify orally could not assert the corporations privilege The corporation cannot testify orally So that as a matter of physical possibility a corporation can not assert the immunity of the Fifth Amendment to oral ques tioning because a corporation cannot be a witness under oral questioning Mr Justice Brown continues The Amendment is limited to a person who shall be com pelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself and if he cannot set up the privilege of a third person he certainly cannot set up the privilege of a corporation    Indeed so strict is the rule that the privilege is a personal one that it has been held in some cases that the counsel will not be allowed to make the objection Therefore there is nothing in this language which holds that a corporation when put in the only physical situation in which it may be compelled to give evidence against itself namely by the production of documents cannot assert the immunity of the Fifth Amendment or of the common law Mr Justice Brown then takes up the question of the production of documents and reaches the conclusion that to compel a man to produce his papers is com pelling him to be a witness against himself and is the equivalent of a search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment The Justice then refers to the fact that Hale however was immune from prosecution and continues Having already held that by reason of the immunity act of 1903 the witness could not avail himself of the Fifth Amendment it follows that he cannot set up that Amendment as against the production of the books and papers since in respect to these he would also be protected by the immunity act    If whenever an officer or an employe of a corporation was summoned before a grand jury as a witness he could refuse to produce the books and documents of such corporation upon the ground that they would incriminate the corporation itself it would result in the failure of a large number of cases where the illegal combination was determinable only upon the examination of such papers This last language certainly tends to the evasion of the cor porate privilege But two things are to be noted of it First it is really dictum The Hale case was decided conclusively by the proposition that Hale personally subpoenaed could not assert the corporations privilege Second the language limits itself to a 448SELF INCRIMINATION case where the officer is personally subpoenaed It does not suggest what the ruling would be were the corporation itself sub poenaed to produce It is true that Mr Justice Brown further elaborates a distinction between a corporation and an individual pointing out that corporate privileges should involve corporate re sponsibilities his thesis being represented substantially by the following language While an individual may lawfully refuse to answer incrim inating questions unless protected by an immunity statute it does not follow that a corporation vested with special privileges and franchises may refuse to show its hand when charged with an abuse of such privileges But again it is to be remembered that the decision did not really involve this question As to the Fourth Amendment guaranteeing against unreason able searches and seizures Mr Justice Brown writes We do not wish to be understood as holding that a corpo ration is not entitled to immunity under the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures In other words he carefully states that he is not holding that a corporation is not connoted in the word people in the Fourth Amendment where the people are guaranteed against unreason able searches and seizures Mr Justice Harlan for himself alone holds substantially that a corporation has no rights under either the Fourth or Fifth Amendment Mr Justice McKennas opinion is thus summed up by Judge Lanning of the Circuit Court of Appeals 8 Mr Justice McKenna leaves open the question whether a corporation can claim immunity under either the fourth or the fifth amendment It remains to be considered whether these utterances viewed on the light of precedent and subsequent citation justify the con clusion that corporate privilege against self incrimination by pro duction of documents is destroyed Professor Wigmore points out the ancient origin of the privilege9 to corporations In I744 in spection of corporate books was not allowed where there was an information against justices for granting licenses10 In 1749 an 8Cassatt v Mitchell Coal  Coke Co 1907 150 Fed 32 D4 Wigmore Evidence 3116 note Rex v Cornelius I744 2 Stra

corporation secretarys refusal to produce documents on account of their tendency to incriminate for whom I am inter ested and himself was sanctioned The Supreme Court of Penn sylvania writes 12 We have carefully considered the position taken by plaintiffs counsel on the reargument that we may require the defendant corporation to produce the required writings even though a natural person in a like case could not be called upon for their production We are not able to agree with the reasoning We think that the rules of evidence and the rules of law for the production of writ ings are essentially the same whether the defendant is a natural or an artificial person A corporation has been held to be a person within the meaning of the penal statutes13 It is a citizen under the provisions regard ing jurisdiction of the Circuit Court14 It is a person within the Usury Statute1 within the meaning of the Treaty of Peace16 within the Fourteenth Amendment  within the Statute of Limita tions18 within the Act of Congress of I797 applying to prefer ences19 within the Bankruptcy Act within Section 4901 of the Revised Statutes providing a penalty for marking an unpatented article Patented20 And as we have seen Mr Justice Brown himself in Hale v Henkel holds that it is embraced in the word people under the Fifth Amendment It is impossible to frame a logical theory con sistent with these precedents that shall exclude it from the conno tation of person in the Fifth Amendment Did Mr Justice Brown mean so to exclude it King v Purnell I748 I W Bl 37 45 aLogan v Pennsylvania R

simultaneously with Hale v Henkel he writes For reasons already partly set forth we think that the im munity provided by the Fifth Amendment against selfincrimina tion is personal to the witness himself and that he cannot set up the privilege of another person or of a corporation as an excuse for a refusal to answerin other words the privilege is that of the witness himself and not that of the party on trial If he had meant his language largely argumentative dictum as we have seen in the Hale case so to exclude it it cannot be believed that this simultaneous decision would be based not upon the ground that a corporation had no privilege but on the thesis that an individual could not assert that privilege as a bar to per sonal oral examination In the case of Wilson v United States argued in the Supreme Court but not yet decided a corporation was subpoenaed to pro duce its books The subpoena was answered by its officer Wilson with the statement that he had the books and that they tended to incriminate him The Circuit Court overruled this objection ap parently on the principle that he could not plead his privilege when the corporation was subpoenaedthe exact converse of Hale v Henkel Later decisions other than those of Judges Hand and Lacombe heretofore referred to seem to regard the question as open In Cassatt v Mitchell Coal  Coke Co22 Judge Lanning writes after summarizing the various opinions in the Hale case that These varying expressions of opinion emphasize the impro priety of any expression of opinion without full argument on the question of the existence of corpo rate privilege against self incrimination In Consolidated Ren dering Co v Vermont23 Mr Justice Peckham said The fifth objection is also without merit even upon the assumption that in such a case as this the company could take the objection through the witness The court simply held that it could not determine whether the objection as to incrimination was valid until the books were produced for inspection by the court though before they were to be used in evidence He places his ruling squarely not on the proposition that the corporation has no privilege but on the statement that if it has 2201 U S 90 9I Supra 45 2908 207 U S 541 552 451COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW one it must assert it in a particular way Professor Wigmore in his supplemental volume writes 24 The decision in Hale v Henkel supra may perhaps be sup ported on the ground that where the criminality of an act con sists for a corporation essentially in the violation of its franchise or privilege the feature of criminality is a merely incidental one or on the ground that the power to create involves the power to forfeit But the opinion does not face the argument contra based on the criminal capacity of a corporation Judge Hand in the case of the Bornn Hat Company hereto fore referred to regarded the question sufficiently doubtful to justify a supersedeas on the appeal to the Supreme Court But today in the Southern District of New York at all events it is temporarily at least the law that a corporation has no privilege against self incrimination The distinction between a corporation and an individual in this respect is not based on any legal logic If it is desirable to curtail the privilege generally appropriate constitutional amendment to that end is the proper course In its final analysis the fining of the corporation is deprivation of the property of its stockholders and the Fifth Amendment looks by its terms to the protection not only of life but of liberty and property And so long as those guarantees stand the property of individuals cannot reasonably be appro priated because it exists in corporate form by a process which if attempted to be applied to individuals would everywhere be regarded as a violation of fundamental privilege JOSEPH M PROSKAUER NEw YORK 25 Wigmore Evidence 228 452

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1077308,COURSES IN SPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING FOR HIGH SCHOOLS WITH REFERENCE TO MATHEMATICS,I244682,THE SCHOOL REVIEW A JOURNAL OF SECONDARY EDUCATION VOLUME XXIV FEBRUARY I916 NUMBER 2 COURSES IN SPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING FOR HIGH SCHOOLS WITH REFERENCE TO MATHEMATICS W D REEVE UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA WE NO LONGER BELIEVE THAT MERE KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECTMATTER IS THE ONLY PREREQUISITE FOR A TEACHER OF ANY SUBJECT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO MINIMIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF ADEQUATE INSTRUCTION IN A RANGE OF SUBJECTMATTER BROAD AND INCLUSIVE ENOUGH TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PROSPECTIVE TEACHER CERTAINLY A WISE STUDY OF THE PROBLEMS IN TEACHING ANY SUBJECT SHOULD BE BASED UPON A SOLID FOUNDATION OF KNOWLEDGE IN THAT SUBJECT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IF POSSIBLE IS TO SECURE THE PROPER RELATION BETWEEN THE TWO POINTS OF METHOD AND MATTER SO THAT ONE MAY NOT BE NEGLECTED FOR THE OTHER IT IS NOT OUR PURPOSE IN THIS PAPER HOW EVER TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECTMATTER THAT SHOULD FORM A PROPER BASIS FOR THE PROSPECTIVE TEACHER BUT RATHER TO DISCUSS SPECIAL METHODS OF HANDLING THE SUBJECTMATTER WHICH OUR PROSPECTIVE TEACHER HAS IN HIS POSSESSION WHEN HE ENTERS THE SPECIALMETHODS COURSE TOGETHER WITH A TREATMENT OF WHATEVER SUBJECTMATTER IT MAY SEEM NECESSARY TO GIVE DURING THE PERIOD OF INSTRUCTION IN MAKING A STUDY OF THE SITUATION THE WRITER HAS ATTEMPTED TO SURVEY SOME WHAT THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRAINING OF SECONDARY I PAPER READ BEFORE COLLEGE TEACHERS OF EDUCATION AT THE MINNESOTA EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION AT MINNEAPOLIS OCTOBER 29 1915 8990 THE SCHOOL REVIEW TEACHERS ESPECIALLY TEACHERS OF SECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN EUROPE AND IN THE UNITED STATES WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS STUDY AS TO WHAT MAY BE DONE WITH PROFIT IN A SPECIALMETHODS COURSE IN MATHEMATICS TWENTY YEARS AGO LITTLE ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE NEEDS OF PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS OF SECONDARY SUBJECTS ESPECIALLY TO PRO SPECTIVE TEACHERS OF SECONDARY MATHEMATICS EVIDENTLY IT NEVER OCCURRED TO MANY COLLEGE TEACHERS THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF THEIR STUDENTS WERE TO BE THE TEACHERS OF THE NEXT GENERATION AND THAT AS SUCH THEY SHOULD GO OUT WELL PREPARED TO GIVE ADEQUATE INSTRUC TION ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE AMERICAN COMMISSIONERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS NO SEPARATE INSTITUTIONS FOR THE TRAINING OF SECONDARY TEACHERS EXISTED IT SEEMS ALMOST INCREDIBLE THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT PRO FESSION AS THAT OF TEACHING SHOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED MORE CONSIDER ATION SOME OF US BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT YET RECEIVING ALL OF THE ATTENTION THAT IT DESERVES FOR SOME YEARS PAST HOWEVER METHODS COURSES OF ONE TYPE OR ANOTHER HAVE BEEN OFFERED IN MANY OF OUR LEADING NORMAL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND THE ORGANIZATION OF COLLEGES OF EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE LAND WHICH ARE OFFERING SPECIAL METHODS COURSES IN THE DIFFERENT SUBJECTS IS EVIDENCE ENOUGH THAT SCHOOL PEOPLE GENERALLY ARE BEGINNING TO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR A MORE TECHNICAL STUDY OF THE ART OF TEACHING THE FACT REMAINS THAT A LARGE MAJORITY OF TEACHERS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE HAD NO SUCH PREPARATION IN SPECIAL METHODS AND THEIR ONLY ASSET IS A KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECTMATTER WHICH THEY ARE TO TEACH IN MANY CASES EVEN THE LATTER IS VERY MEAGER AND INADEQUATE THE REPORT OF THE AMERICAN COMMISSIONERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS SAYS THE AVERAGE NEWLY APPOINTED TEACHER OF MATHEMATICS IS A COLLEGE GRADUATE WHO HAS HAD ONLY ABOUT ONE YEARS WORK FROM 90 TO I8O CLASS HOURS OF MATHE MATICS BEYOND THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL IN WHICH HE TEACHES THE AVERAGE PREPARATION INCLUDES NO STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL TRAINING NO COURSE IN THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS TO INITIATE THE CANDIDATE INTO THE TEACHERS MODE OF VIEWING THE EVENTS OF THE CLASSROOM CONSEQUENTLY HE ENTERS UPON HIS WORK WITH BUT LITTLE MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE IN ADVANCE OF HIS PUPILS AND WITH NO TRAINING AT ALL IN THE TECHNIQUE OF THE WORK HE IS ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE HE IS ESSENTIALLY A FORMER PUPIL SOMEWHAT MATURED BY THE GENERAL EXPERIENCE OF HIS COLLEGESPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING MATHEMATICS 91 STUDIES AND LIFE COME BACK TO TEACH HIS QUONDAM FELLOWS IF SUCCESSFUL IN HIS WORK HE DEVELOPS INTO A GOOD TEACHER AT THE EXPENSE OF MANY MISTAKES MORE OR LESS NUMEROUS AND SERIOUS ACCORDING TO HIS MEASURE OF NATIVE APTITUDE FOR THE WORK OF A TEACHER ON ALL SIDES WE HEAR THE CRY FOR SUPERVISION OF TEACHING A KIND OF TEACHING THAT RESULTS FROM THE SORT OF PREPARATION DESCRIBED ABOVE OFTEN AMOUNTS TO MERE TELLING IT IS A SHAME THAT SUCH A TEACHER ESPECIALLY THE NEW AND INEXPERIENCED SHOULD BE LEFT ALONE TO WORRY WITH THE THOUSAND PROBLEMS WITH WHICH HE MUST SURELY GRAPPLE AND OFTEN WITH LITTLE SUCCESS IN SPITE OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO IMPROVE TECHNIQUE IN TEACHING THERE ARE STILL MANY SCHOOLS WHICH IF THEY ARE NOT ENTIRELY IGNORING THE NEED FOR SPECIALMETHODS COURSES ARE SURELY MARKING TIME SO FAR AS PROGRESS IS CONCERNED BUT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A GREAT SEA OF PEDAGOGICAL UNREST AND WE MUST FACE THE SITUATION WITH COURAGE AND WITH SOME DEGREE OF SECURITY OF OUR MOORINGS IF WE ARE TO ADD ANYTHING CONSTRUCTIVE IN THE WAY OF PROGRESSIVE ACTION AMONG THE SCHOOLS WHICH HAVE BEEN GIVING SPECIALMETHODS COURSES REMARKABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN GENERAL PEDAGOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND THIS HAS LED TO A RENEWED STUDY OF THE NEEDS OF SPECIAL SUBJECTS AS MODIFICATIONS OF THE GENERAL SITUATION EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS OUR OWN HAVE BEGUN TO REALIZE THE NEED OF A MORE CENTRALIZED SYSTEM FOR THE TRAINING OF SECONDARY TEACHERS AND IN SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY IN GERMANY THE NEED FOR SPECIAL TRAINING IS NOT SO GREAT AS IT IS IN MANY PARTS OF OUR OWN COUNTRY THE PREPARATION OF MATHEMATICS TEACHERS WAS TO HAVE BEEN THE MAIN TOPIC OF DISCUSSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS AT MUNICH GERMANY IN AUGUST 1915 THIS UNIVERSAL UNREST AND DESIRE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING HAS LED TO A MORE SERIOUS STUDY OF THE SITUA TION THAN FORMERLY AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT MANY RADICAL CHANGES AND REFORMS BOTH IN THE SUBJECTMATTER AND IN THE TEACH ING OF SECONDARY SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED UNTIL RECENTLY MOST OF THESE PROPOSED CHANGES HAVE BEEN OFFERED WITH REFERENCE TO SUBJECTS SUCH AS THE LANGUAGES AND THE SCIENCES BUT IN SOME CASES THERE HAVE BEEN VERY MARKED CHANGES PROPOSED FOR THE92 THE SCHOOL REVIEW MATHEMATICS COURSES COMMISSIONER SNEDDEN OF MASSACHUSETTS AND SUPERINTENDENT MORRISON OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE ARDENT ADVO CATES OF REFORM BOTH IN THE SUBJECTMATTER AND IN THE TEACHING OF SECONDARY MATHEMATICS A DEANS OF ONE OF OUR BESTKNOWN COLLEGES OF EDUCATION HAS RECENTLY SAID THE SOCIAL VALUE OF GEOMETRY HAS BEEN RELATIVELY UNCHANGED IN TWO THOUSAND YEARS AND HE ADDS THOUGH GEOMETRY MAY HAVE BEEN THE BEST MATHEMATICS AVAILABLE FOR YOUTH IN PAST CENTURIES IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT IT CONTINUES TO BE THE BEST SUBJECTMATTER AVAILABLE AT THE PRESENT TIME WHILE WE MAY NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE OPINIONS OF DIFFERENT ADVOCATES OF REFORM WE MUST ADMIT THAT THERE IS SOME ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT BOTH IN SUBJECTMATTER AND IN METHODS OF TEACHING AS A RESULT OF ALL THIS AGITATION TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS HAVE BEGUN TO ASK THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY ARE REALLY OFFERING THE BEST COURSES IN THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER IN PARTICULAR THE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN EDUCATION ARE BEGINNING TO GET TOGETHER AND ARE TRYING TO FORMULATE PLANS AND TO ORGANIZE SPECIALMETHODS COURSES THAT WILL MOST NEARLY MEET THE REASONABLE DEMANDS OF THE TIME FOR PRO GRESSIVE ACTION AND WHICH WILL AT THE SAME TIME FUNCTION THE BEST IN THE FUTURE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION OF THE PROSPECTIVE TEACHER THE WRITER OF THIS PAPER HAS HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING IN SUCH A CONFERENCE OF TEACHERS AND HAS HEARD THE FRANK ADMISSION FROM MORE THAN ONE WELLKNOWN TEACHER OF METHODS THAT HE REALIZED THAT HIS COURSE WAS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE THAT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS MATERIAL WAS FILLER AND THAT SOMETHING DEFINITE SHOULD BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE COURSES IN SPECIAL METHODS THE TESTIMONY OF PRACTICE TEACHERS WITH WHOM THE WRITER HAS HAD SOME EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT THEY GAINED A GREAT DEAL FROM THE METHODS COURSES IN THE WAY OF HISTORICAL MATERIAL AND KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECTMATTER BUT SINCE THEY BEGAN TO TEACH THEY REALIZED THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACH ING IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MUCH OF THIS TECHNICAL INFORMATION CANNOT BE GIVEN AS SOME OF THE METHODS COURSES ARE NOW HANDLED I SCHOOL AND SOCIETY MAY I 1915 P 621 ALSO AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL MONTHLY APRIL I915 P II9 2 THIRTEENTH YEARBOOK OF THE NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF EDUCATION PART I 3 PARKER METHODS OF TEACHING IN HIGH SCHOOLS P 60SPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING MATHEMATICS 93 ANOTHER SEVERE CRITICISM THAT IS OFTEN HEARD IS THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF DUPLICATION OF SUBJECTMATTER IN THE SOCALLED METHODS COURSES ONE STUDENT SAID THAT HE HAD TAKEN THREE DIFFERENT METHODS COURSES AND HAD RECEIVED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INSTRUCTION THAT WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME IN ALL SUCH COURSES SHOULD BE REOR GANIZED OR THE STUDENT SHOULD HAVE HIS COURSE ARRANGED SO THAT SUCH DUPLICATION WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THE SOLUTION NO DOUBT INVOLVES THE GETTING TOGETHER OF THE GROUP OF PEOPLE GIVING THE METHODS COURSES CERTAIN STANDARDS AND PROGRAMS SHOULD BE SET UP THAT WILL NOT PERMIT OF SO MUCH REPETITION AND ACCOMPANYING WASTE FOUR WAYS HAVE BEEN OFFERED BY MEANS OF WHICH PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS MAY PROFITABLY PROCEED I BY READING THE PUBLISHED RESULTS OF THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS METHOD OF IMPROVEMENT IT OUGHT TO BE SAID THAT SUCH WORKS AS YOUNGS THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS SMITHS THE TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS AND THE TEACHING OF GEOMETRY SCHULTZES THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS IN SECONDARY SCHOOL AND EVANS THE TEACHING OF HIGHSCHOOL MATHEMATICS HAVE BEEN PROLIFIC SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND HELP TO A LARGE NUMBER OF PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS 2 BY PERSONAL CONSULTATION WITH EXPERIENCED TEACHERS THIS IS ALWAYS A HELPFUL METHOD OF IMPROVEMENT IF THE EXPERIENCED TEACHER IS A GOOD TEACHER 3 BY OBSERVING TEACHERS AT WORK IN THE REPORT OF COMMITTEE NO 8 OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE TEACHING OF MATHE MATICS P 30 WE FIND THIS STATEMENT IT IS BELIEVED BY MANY THAT THE BEST PEDAGOGICAL TRAINING COMES THROUGH CAREFUL AND DILIGENT STUDY OF THE SUBJECTMATTER UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF AN INSPIRING TEACHER WHO KNOWS HOW TO EXHIBIT GOOD METHODS AND TO IMPRESS THEM BY EXAMPLE RATHER THAN PRECEPT UPON THE STUDENTS THERE IS MUCH IN THIS STATEMENT PROVIDED THE METHODS TEACHER IS QUALI FIED TO DO A HIGH TYPE OF TEACHING 4 BY ACTUAL TEACHING IT IS SAID BY SOME THAT ACTUAL TEACHING EVEN IF IT AMOUNTS PURELY TO THE TRIALANDERROR METHOD IS THE BEST METHODS COURSE IN MATHEMATICS 1 ADAPTED FROM YOUNG THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS P 894 THE SCHOOL REVIEW WHATEVER ELSE BE INCLUDED IT SEEMS CLEAR TO THE WRITER THAT ALL OF THE FOUR METHODS ABOVE SHOULD HAVE A PART IN ANY SPECIAL METHODS COURSE WE HAVE REFERRED IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS PAPER TO THE SITUATION TWENTY YEARS AGO IN OUR OWN COUNTRY WITH REFERENCE TO THE TRAINING OF SECONDARY TEACHERS IN MATHEMATICS AND WE HAVE MENTIONED SEVERAL POINTS CONCERNING THE PRESENT SITUATION A LITTLE STUDY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SITUATION MAY ADD TO A BETTER UNDERSTAND ING OF THE WHOLE QUESTION OF TRAINING TEACHERS ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE AMERICAN COMMISSIONERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS THERE WERE AT LEAST FIVE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS TWENTY YEARS AGO WHICH ESTAB LISHED COURSES ON THE TEACHING OF ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY WHICH TOGETHER WITH A COURSE ON GENERAL PEDOGOGY FORMED A CERTAIN PRO FESSIONAL TRAINING FOR HIGHSCHOOL TEACHING IN MATHEMATICS UP TO 900OO ONLY FOUR OTHER COLLEGES WERE KNOWN BY THIS COMMITTEE TO HAVE ADDED TO THEIR PROGRAMS COURSES ON THE PEDAGOGY OF MATHE MATICS FROM 1900OO TO 910O ABOUT TWENTYFIVE OTHER COLLEGES BESIDES THOSE REFERRED TO ABOVE DEVELOPED COURSES SUCH AS THE HISTORY AND PEDAGOGY OF SECONDARY MATHEMATICS THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS COURSE IN ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY FOR THE OTHER HIGHSCHOOL STUDIES SUCH AS LATIN ENGLISH GERMAN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY THERE HAS BEEN A CORRESPONDING DEVELOPMENT OF PROFESSIONAL COURSES ON THE TEACHING OF THESE SUBJECTS IN 1911 THERE WERE AT LEAST TWELVE SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY WITH PROVISIONS FOR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND SINCE THAT TIME OTHERS HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED THERE ARE AT THE PRESENT TIME A FEW NORMAL COLLEGES SEPARATE FROM ANY UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE WHERE THE WORK IN THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS IS OF AS HIGH GRADE AS THAT OF THE COLLEGES AND LEADS ULTI MATELY TO THE BACHELORS DEGREE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WORK OFFERED BY THESE SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION AND NORMAL COLLEGES AND THAT OFFERED BY A UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT IS THAT PROFESSIONAL COURSES OF STUDY ARE FOUND TO BE BROADER IN SCOPE AND MORE TECHNICAL IE THE COURSES IN THE LATTER SBULLETIN NO 12 1911SPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING MATHEMATICS 95 OFTEN INCLUDE DIRECTED OBSERVATION AND SUPERVISED PRACTICE TEACHING IN SOME HIGH SCHOOL IN EACH OF THE SCHOOLS REPORTED ON BY THE AMERICAN COMMIS SIONERS THE MINIMUM TRAINING OF A PROFESSIONAL NATURE FOR SECONDARY WORK IS A DEFI NITELY ORGANIZED COURSE ON THE TEACHING OF SECONDARY MATHEMATICS  THIS COURSE VARIES IN LENGTH FROM 17 TO GO HOURS OF CLASS WORK THE AVERAGE FOR ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS BEING 48 HOURS THE METHODS OF HANDLING THE COURSE IS IN GENERAL BY LECTURES RECITATIONS ON ASSIGNED READINGS DISCUSSIONS WRITTEN REPORTS AND QUIZZES THE SUBJECTMATTER OF THIS COURSE VARIES SOMEWHAT IN EACH INSTITUTION THOUGH CERTAIN TOPICS ARE COMMON TO PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE COURSES THE COMMITTEE PREPARED A COMPOSITE SYLLABUS OF A TENTATIVE MAXIMUM COURSE BASED ON THE SYLLABI SENT IN BY THE LEADING INSTI TUTIONS THE COURSE TREATS OF SUCH TOPICS AS THE REASONS FOR TEACHING ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THESE SUBJECTS AND OF THE METHODS OF PRESENTING THEM THE WORLDS BEST LITERATURE CONCERNING THE TEACHING OF MATHE MATICS THE MATHEMATICAL CURRICULUM IN AMERICAN AND FOREIGN SECONDARY SCHOOLS THE ADAPTATION OF A CURRICULUM TO THE NEEDS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF SCHOOLS A STUDY OF TYPICAL AMERICAN AND FOREIGN TEXTS FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND THE VARIOUS MOVEMENTS TO REFORM THE TEACHING OF SECONDARY MATHEMATICS AT HOME AND ABROAD SOME ATTENTION IS OFTEN GIVEN TO THE METHODS OF CONDUCTING A RECITATION IN MATHEMATICS WITH DISCUSSIONS OF THE HUERISTIC METHOD THE LABORA TORY METHOD THE NOTEXT METHOD ETC THE COURSE ALSO CONTAINS A REVIEW OF TYPICAL PARTS OF ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY OFFERING SCIENTIFIC OR PEDAGOGIC DIFFI CULTIES SUCH AS THE NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA EQUIVALENT EQUATIONS FACTORING THEORY OF EXPONENTS SIMULTANEOUS QUADRATIC EQUATIONS GRAPHIC SOLUTIONS THE FOUNDATIONS OF GEOMETRY THE SEQUENCE OF PROPOSITIONS THE TREATMENT OF PARALLELS LOCI LIMITS INCOMMENSURABLE CASES METHODS OF ATTACKING EXERCISES IN GEOMETRY AND THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEMS AND EXERCISES OF ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY THE READING OF CURRENT PERIODICAL LITERATURE ON THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS AND THE DISCUSSION OF SUCH TOPICS AS TEACHING ALGEBRA AND GEOME TRY TOGETHER THE FUSION OF PLANE AND SOLID GEOMETRY ETC ARE OFTEN INCLUDED SUCH BOOKS AS SMITHS THE TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS AND THE TEACHING OF GEOMETRY AND YOUNGS THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS ARE FREQUENTLY USED AS OUTLINES OR TEXTS FOR SUCH A COURSE FINES COLLEGE ALGEBRA AND NUMBER SYSTEM OF ALGEBRA CHRYSTALS ALGEBRA AND THE HISTORIES OF MATHEMATICS BY BALL FINK CAJORI GOW AND ALLMAN ARE FREQUENTLY REPORTED AS REFERENCE BOOKS THE PREREQUISITES FOR THE ABOVE COURSE ARE ONE YEAR OF COLLEGE MATHEMATICS IN ABOUT HALF OF THE CASES AND THROUGH THE CALCULUS IN THE OTHERS EVEN WHERE96 THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE FORMER REQUIREMENT EXISTS IT USUALLY HAPPENS THAT MOST OF THE STUDENTS HAVE HAD THE CALCULUS AND SUCH COURSES AS THE THEORY OF EQUATIONS AND PRO JECTIVE GEOMETRY AS A MINIMUM PREPARATION BEFORE ENTERING THE PEDAGOGICAL COURSE THIS PEDAGOGICAL COURSE IS NORMALLY TAKEN IN THE SENIOR YEAR IN A FEW OF THE SCHOOLS OFFERING THE TEACHERS COURSES SYSTEMATIC WORK IN OBSERVATION AND PRACTICE TEACHING WAS GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE METHODS WORK SEVERAL YEARS AGO THIS WORK WAS CARRIED ON EITHER IN A HIGH SCHOOL CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION OR BY A SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT IN THE PUBLIC CITY HIGH SCHOOLS AT THE PRESENT TIME THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA DOES BOTH THE UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE STUDENTS WHO WANT TO OBSERVE AND TEACH SO AN ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE WITH SUPERINTENDENT SPAULDING OF THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY SCHOOLS WHEREBY PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS MAY DO OBSERVATION AND PRACTICE TEACHING IN THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHAT IS BEING DONE IN THIS COUNTRY AT THE PRESENT TIME IN SPECIALMETHODS COURSES IN THE TEACHING OF MATHE MATICS THE WRITER MADE A SURVEY OF SEVERAL OF THE LEADING SCHOOLS OF THIS COUNTRY THESE SCHOOLS WERE ASKED TO REPORT ON WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THEIR SPECIALMETHODS COURSES IN MATHEMATICS AND TO CONTRIBUTE ANY FURTHER IDEAS THEY MIGHT HAVE AS TO WHAT THEY THOUGHT OUGHT TO CONSTITUTE SUCH A COURSE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO SECURE REPLIES TO ALL THE INQUIRIES SENT OUT BUT FROM THOSE RECEIVED THE WRITER HAS COLLECTED A FEW INTERESTING FACTS I ONE SCHOOL HAS THREE DIFFERENT TEACHERS COURSES ONE FOR THOSE WITHOUT EXPERIENCE ONE FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE AND ONE FOR TEACHERS OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS 2 IN NEARLY ALL OF THE METHODS COURSES SUCH TEXTS AS YOUNGS THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS AND SMITHS THE TEACHING OF ELE MENTARY MATHEMATICS ARE USED AS REFERENCES 3 SOME OFFER NO SPECIALMETHODS COURSES AT ALL 4 THE AVERAGE TIME GIVEN IS FROM TWO TO THREE HOURS PER WEEK PER SEMESTER 5 VERY FEW HAVE DIRECTED OBSERVATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE METHODS COURSES IN MATHEMATICSSPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING MATHEMATICS 97 6 ONLY ONE OR TWO SCHOOLS OUT OF THOSE REPORTING REQUIRE ANY TEACHING IN CONNECTION WITH THE METHODS COURSE IN MATHEMATICS 7 IN A FEW CASES AT LEAST TWO METHODS COURSES ARE REQUIRED 8 IN SEVERAL SCHOOLS A GREAT DEAL OF THE TIME IS GIVEN OVER TO A DISCUSSION OF HISTORICAL MATERIAL AND SUBJECTMATTER WITH A MINI MUM OF REFERENCE TO TECHNIQUE IN TEACHING AND THE REAL LIVE PROB LEMS OF THE CLASSROOM THE STUDY WHICH THE WRITER HAS MADE HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETE ENOUGH TO INCLUDE ALL THE IMPORTANT FACTS THAT MAY EXIST IN REGARD TO SPECIALMETHODS COURSES BUT FROM THE REPLIES SENT IN IT IS CLEAR THAT NOT ENOUGH EMPHASIS SEEMS TO BE GIVEN IN MANY OF THESE COURSES TO DIRECTED OBSERVATION OF HIGHSCHOOL WORK AND TO TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING AS A RESULT OF ALL THIS STUDY OF SPECIALMETHODS COURSES TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM AND PERSONAL CONSULTA TION WITH MANY HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS AND PRACTICE STUDENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN COURSES IN SPECIAL METHODS IN MATHEMATICS THE WRITER WISHES TO SUBMIT SOME SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO TENTATIVE SPECIAL METHODS COURSES IN MATHEMATICS IN THE HOPE THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDS AND FURTHER STUDY MAY GIVE US A TYPE OF TRAINING THAT WILL MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE TIME I SPECIALMETHODS COURSES SHOULD BE ORGANIZED SO AS TO GIVE MORE TIME AT LEAST SOME TIME TO DIRECTED OBSERVATION AND TEACH ING BY THE TRIALANDERROR METHOD THIS WILL BE POSSIBLE ONLY WHERE HIGHSCHOOL CLASSES ARE ACCESSIBLE II THE STUDENT TEACHERS COURSE SHOULD BE SO CLEARLY OUTLINED AND THE PREREQUISITES SO SET UP THAT A GREAT DEAL OF THE MATERIAL NOW GIVEN IN SPECIALMETHODS COURSES MAY GIVE WAY TO THE DIRECTED OBSERVATION AND PRACTICE TEACHING REFERRED TO ABOVE THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE TRAINING FOR TEACHING MAY NOT BE MADE AS EFFICIENT AND DEFINITE AS FOR LAW MEDICINE OR ENGINEERING III THE PERSON GIVING THE METHODS COURSE SHOULD IF POSSIBLE BE IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE CLASSROOM WHILE THE OBSERVATION OR PRACTICE TEACHING IS BEING DONE BY HIS STUDENT TEACHERS HE MAY BE THE HEAD OF THE MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT IN THE HIGH SCHOOL THE  SEE BULLETIN NO 14 1912 US BUREAU OF EDUCATION ON PROPOSED MINIMUM REQUIREMENT98 THE SCHOOL REVIEW HEAD OF THE MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT IN THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION OR HE MAY BE A MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS BUT IN ANY CASE HE OUGHT TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE TIME HIS METHODS CLASS SEES IT HE MAY ACTUALLY TEACH THE CLASS HIMSELF OR HE MAY TAKE THE CLASS TO OBSERVE THE WORK OF SOME GOOD HIGHSCHOOL TEACHER IF THE HIGHSCHOOL TEACHER IS A GOOD ONE IT IS PERHAPS BETTER FOR THE METHODS TEACHER TO LOOK ON WITH HIS STUDENT TEACHERS IN THIS WAY HE GETS A FULLER AND MORE SPONTANEOUS REACTION FROM THESE STUDENTS IN SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS OF THE CLASS ROOM SITUATION IV THESE DISCUSSIONS OF THE CLASSROOM SITUATION OUGHT TO AFFORD THE MOST EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INSTRUCTION IN TECHNIQUE THE CLASSROOM WILL THUS BE SERVING THE STUDENT TEACHER IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS THE CLINIC AND HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE AS INTERNE SERVE THE PROSPECTIVE PHYSICIAN V IF ANY STUDENTS ARE ASKED TO TEACH THOSE WORKING FIRST SHOULD BE CAREFULLY SELECTED FROM THE STRONGER MEMBERS OF THE CLASS AND IF POSSIBLE FROM THOSE WHO MAY HAVE HAD A LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN NO CASE SHOULD A STUDENT WHO IS NOT ENTIRELY CAPABLE BE GIVEN ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF A CLASS THIS OF COURSE MUST BE LEFT TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE PERSON GIVING THE METHODS COURSE IF NECESSARY THE STUDENT SHOULD BE HELPED IN MAKING HIS PLAN WHEN HE FIRST BEGINS TO TEACH AND SHOULD BE JUDGED BY THE WAY IN WHICH HE USES IT VI STUDENTS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO SOME OBSERVING IN CLASSES OTHER THAN IN THE CLASS AND IN THE SUBJECT WHICH THEY EXPECT TO TEACH SO AS TO MAKE SOME COMPARISONS OF THE RECITATIONS VISITED IN REGARD TO SUCH ITEMS AS A TEACHERS I PERSONALITY AND PREPARATION OF TEACHERS 2 ROUTINE FACTORS OF RECITATION 3 DEVICES 4 DISCIPLINE 5 ASSIGNMENT B PUPILS I INTEREST IN AND ATTITUDE TOWARD SUBJECT 2 QUALITY OF ORAL AND WRITTEN WORK 3 DEPORTMENT SEE SUGGESTIVE OUTLINES FOR OBSERVATION ON P 5 OF THE REPORT AND RECOM MENDATIONS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRACTICE TEACHING PUBLISHED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTASPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING MATHEMATICS 99 VII A FEW OF THE FIRST MEETINGS OF THE CLASS IN SPECIAL METHODS MAY HAVE TO BE DEVOTED TO A DISCUSSION OF METHODS OF TAKING NOTES ON THE CLASSROOM SITUATION WHICH THE STUDENT TEACHERS ARE TO OBSERVE OR THEY MAY NOT RECEIVE A MAXIMUM OF PROFIT FROM THEIR VISITATIONS THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT ON SUCH DISCUSSIONS WILL VARY WITH THE SCHOOL THE RECORD OF TEACHING EFFICIENCY PREPARED BY THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WILL FURNISH SPECIALMETHODS TEACHERS WITH MANY IDEAS AS TO WHAT THINGS MAY BE LOOKED FOR IN VISITS TO THE CLASSROOM THE FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS TO STUDENTS WHO ARE TO DO DIRECTED VISITING MAY BE HELPFUL I TRY TO REACH THE CLASSROOM WHICH YOU ARE TO VISIT A LITTLE BEFORE TIME FOR THE RECITATION TO BEGIN INTRODUCE YOURSELF IF POSSIBLE AND TELL THE TEACHER IN CHARGE WHY YOU ARE THERE THE AVERAGE TEACHER DOES NOT CARE AS A RULE TO HAVE PEOPLE COMING INTO HIS CLASSES AFTER THE RECITATION HAS BEGUN STAY IF POSSIBLE UNTIL THE RECITATION IS OVER THIS IS AS IMPORTANT AS GETTING THERE ON TIME BE COURTEOUS ENOUGH TO PAY THE VERY BEST ATTENTION TO ALL THAT TAKES PLACE WHILE YOU ARE IN THE ROOM 2 REMEMBER THAT REAL CRITICISM IS CONSTRUCTIVE AS WELL AS ADVERSE NOBODY EVER GETS THE MOST FROM HIS VISITING WHO IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A CHANCE TO GIVE THE TEACHER A BLACK EYE THE TRUTH IS PERHAPS THAT THERE ARE MORE CHANCES TO COMPLIMENT DEVICES AND TO GAIN INSPIRATION THAN WE THINK 3 DO NOT BECOME SO ENGROSSED IN THE WORK AS TO FORGET TO JOT DOWN SIGNIFICANT POINTS AND BY ALL MEANS GIVE INFORMATION THAT IS DEFINITE AND TO THE POINT CONCERNING THE RECITATION BE SURE YOU HAVE SOMETHING FROM THE RECITATION IN BLACK AND WHITE TO SUBSTANTIATE WHAT YOU MAY SAY CONCERNING IT DO NOT BE AFRAID TO BE DETAILED IN YOUR STATEMENTS SUCH COMMENTS AS THE TEACHERS METHODS WERE EFFICIENT THE WAY HE HANDLED A SLOW PUPIL WAS INTERESTING ARE ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS AS INTELLIGENT COM MENTS ON ANY RECITATION DESCRIBE IN DETAIL SOME OF THE METHODS USED AND THE SUBSEQUENT REACTIONS SHOW HOW THE SLOW PUPIL WAS DEALT WITH AND PRESENT THE SITUATION FROM BEGINNING TO END ONLY IN THIS WAY CAN WE SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 4 WHAT ATTITUDE HAVE THE PUPILS TOWARD THE WORK IS THERE A SPIRIT OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TEACHER AND THE PUPILS I00 THE SCHOOL REVIEW HOW DO THE PUPILS RESPOND TO THE TASKS SET FOR THEM BY THE TEACHER  5 IS THE TEACHER GIVING THE PUPIL ANY GOOD HABITS OF STUDY  IS THERE ANY REFERENCE TO INDEPENDENT WORK OUTSIDE OF CLASS  IS THERE ANY PROVISION MADE FOR INSTRUCTING THE SLOW PUPILS OUTSIDE OF THE RECITATION  6 NOTE THE ROUTINE FACTORS OF THE SITUATION SUCH AS LIGHTING VENTILATION SEATING ARRANGEMENT MATERIAL EQUIPMENT FOR THE SUB JECT TO BE TAUGHT ETC 7 STUDY THE RECITATION AS A WHOLE DOES THE TEACHER ASK GOOD QUESTIONS WRITE DOWN SIGNIFICANT ONES DO THE PUPILS SHOW GREAT INTEREST BY VOLUNTEERING OR DO THEY RESPOND ONLY WHEN CALLED UPON BY THE TEACHER DOES THE TEACHER USE SARCASM  ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF DISCIPLINE AT ALL HOW DOES THE TEACHER HANDLE THEM WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN CHARGE IS THE RECI TATION OF SUCH A NATURE THAT NEW PROBLEMS ARISE IN CLASS  DOES THE TEACHER EQUIP THE PUPILS FOR THE HANDLING OF THESE PROBLEMS  8 DO NOT FORM ANY FINAL OPINION OF A TEACHER UPON THE BASIS OF THE VISITS OF A DAY OR EVEN OF A WEEK A FAIR JUDGMENT WILL INVOLVE CAREFUL VISITING OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME 9 KEEP YOUR NOTES CAREFULLY AND NEATLY AND DO NOT DESTROY THEM THEY WILL PROBABLY BE OF USE TO YOU LATER WHEN YOU GO OUT TO TEACH VIII IN ADDITION TO THE DISCUSSIONS REGARDING WHAT IS SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE CLASSROOM IT OUGHT TO BE POSSIBLE TO WORK IN DISCUSSIONS OF CERTAIN QUESTIONS WHICH ARE OF IMPORTANCE TO THE BEGINNING TEACHER I THE STUDENT TEACHER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO ANSWER THREE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT OF MATHEMATICS WHY IT IS TAUGHT WHAT IS TAUGHT AND HOW IT IS TAUGHT THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION INVOLVES A STUDY OF THE PURPOSE AND VALUE OF THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS THE TEACHER MUST KNOW ALL HE CAN ABOUT THE WHY OF THE TEACHING NOT ONLY THAT HE MAY BE ABLE TO INFORM OTHERS OF THE PURPOSE AND VALUE OF TEACHING MATHEMATICS BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO KEEP THE PLACE AND FUNCTION OF MATHEMATICS IN THE CURRICULUM CLEAR IN HIS OWN MIND IN NO OTHER WAY CAN WESPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING MATHEMATICS IOI SECURE THE BEST TEACHING THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION IS DETERMINED LARGELY BY THE MAKERS OF COURSES OF STUDY AND BY THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SELECTION OF TEXTBOOKS HOWEVER THE TEACHER IS ALWAYS FREE TO LET HIS OWN INDEPENDENT NOTIONS GUIDE HIM LARGELY IN THIS MATTER THEREFORE SOME ATTENTION CERTAINLY SHOULD BE PAID IN A SPECIALMETHODS COURSE IN TRAINING PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS TO A REVIEW OF COURSES OF STUDY AND TEXTS IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY HOWEVER THE STUDY OF THE SUBJECT ITSELF IS THE IMPORTANT THING A WELLTRAINED TEACHER SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ALONG WITHOUT A TEXT IF NECESSARY IT MIGHT BE WELL AT THIS POINT TO CONSIDER ALSO HOW THE NATURE AND CONTENT OF COURSES OF STUDY MAY BE MODIFIED BY SUCH ITEMS AS THE CHARACTER OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE MIDST OF WHICH THE HIGH SCHOOL MUST FUNCTION THE LENGTH OF THE PRESCRIBED COURSE THE RELATION OF MATHEMATICS TO THE OTHER COURSES IN A PARTICULAR SCHOOL AND THE AVAILABLE EQUIPMENT FOR CARRYING ON SUCH A COURSE THE ANSWER TO THE THIRD QUESTION HOW IT IS TAUGHT INVOLVES A STUDY OF METHODS AND MODES THE CLASSROOM OUGHT TO FURNISH ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS QUESTION SINCE IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT IN ANY CLASSROOM ONE METHOD WILL BE USED EXCLUSIVELY FOR AN EXCELLENT TREATMENT OF METHODS AND MODES THE READER IS REFERRED TO CHAP III IN YOUNGS THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS 2 AS SUGGESTED ABOVE THE STUDENT SHOULD BE HELPED IN MAKING HIS PLAN IF NECESSARY WHEN HE FIRST BEGINS TO TEACH AND SHOULD BE JUDGED BY THE WAY IN WHICH HE USES IT LATER THE QUESTION OF LESSON PLANS2 OUGHT TO BE DISCUSSED FULLY WITH REGARD TO THEIR PUR POSE GUIDING PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THEIR CONSTRUCTION TYPES TO BE CONSIDERED AND FINALLY THE ACTUAL WRITING OF SUCH PLANS SHOULD BE REQUIRED OF ALL FOR WHETHER THE STUDENT TEACHES IN THE PRACTICE SCHOOL OR NOT WE ARE PREPARING HIM NO DOUBT FOR A LARGER SCHOOL OF PRACTICE WHERE IT IS OF EQUAL IF NOT GREATER IMPORTANCE THAT HE KNOW JUST EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH DURING THE RECITATION 3 THEN IT IS OF SOME IMPORTANCE THAT THE RECITATION ITSELF BE CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO A ITS TRADITIONAL FUNCTION AND B PRESENTDAY VIEWS I SEE YOUNG THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS CHAP II 2 SEE MCMURRY THE METHOD OF THE RECITATION P 329102 THE SCHOOL REVIEW 4 SOME ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO A STUDY OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SUBJECT AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIVE STUDIES A A STUDY OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL IN CERTAIN TEXTS TO SEE IF THE ORDER IS PSYCHOLOGICAL B A STUDY OF THE PROBLEM OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO THE FOLLOWING ITEMS I PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PROBLEM 2 NORMAL PROBABILITY CURVE 3 THE NEED FOR SUPERVISION 4 VALUE OF STUDY CLASSESTEACHING CHILDREN HOW TO STUDY2 5 CONSIDERATION OF SLOW AND FAST WORKERS3 6 METHODS 7 REFERENCE MATERIAL C A STUDYOF PRESENT STANDARDS AND MEASUREMENTS OF MENTAL ABILITY IN REGARD TO I SIGNIFICANCE OF MOVEMENT 2 HISTORICAL AND CLASSROOM STUDY OF TESTS IN ARITHMETIC AND ALGEBRA SUCH AS THE COURTIS MONROE AND THORNDYKE TESTS 3 GRADING OF TEST PAPERS IN MATHEMATICS WITH AND WITHOUT STANDARDS4 HERE IT SEEMS TO THE WRITER IS THE PLACE TO RAISE THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WITH THE TEACHER STUDENTS A IMPORTANCE OF DECIDING WHAT POINTS OTHER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ARE TO TEST B WHAT WEIGHTS SHALL BE GIVEN TO THE CORRECT ANSWERS OF THESE QUESTIONS C WHETHER PUPILS SHOULD KNOW AT THE OUTSET THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PARTS D NECESSITY OF TEACHING CHILDREN TO PICK OUT THE PROBLEMS THEY ARE SURE THEY CAN DO FIRST SO AS TO USE MORE EFFICIENTLY THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR THE TEST E DEPARTMENTAL METHODS OF GRADING FINAL EXAMINATIONS THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE WHICH MAY BE TAKEN UP AND DISCUSSED IN A SPECIALMETHODS COURSE I A LIST OF REFERENCE BOOKS SUITABLE FOR THE HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS AND FOR THE TEACHERS SHOULD BE MADE5 THERE ARE CERTAIN WORKS IN THIS CONNECTION JUDDS PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS IS VERY HELPFUL 2 SEE MCMURRY HOW TO STUDY 3 THE READER IS REFERRED TO ARTICLES BY SCHORLING IN THE SCHOOL REVIEW OCTOBER AND DECEMBER 1915 ON THE PROBLEM OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE TEACHING OF SECONDARYSCHOOL MATHEMATICS 4 N THIS CONNECTION PROFESSOR CAJORIS ARTICLE IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CENTRAL ASSOCIATION OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS TEACHERS FOR 1913 IS VERY INTERESTING S SEE THE SUGGESTIVE LIST AT THE END OF THIS PAPERSPECIAL METHODS OF TEACHING MATHEMATICS IO3 WHICH THE HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS CAN APPRECIATE SUCH AS BALLS PRIMER OF THE HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS AND MATHEMATICAL RECREATIONS AND PROBLEMS THE TEACHER SHOULD BE PUT IN TOUCH WITH CERTAIN BOOKS ON SPECIAL METHOD SUCH AS YOUNGS TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS SHOULD BE INFORMED ABOUT THE BULLETINS ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT WASHINGTON AND SHOULD BECOME FAMILIAR WITH STANDARD SOURCES OF MATHEMATICAL INFORMATION 2 THE DISCUSSION OF WHAT SHOULD CONSTITUTE A MINIMUM OF EQUIPMENT AND A MEANS OF OBTAINING THE SAME SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AND SOME CONCRETE CONCLUSIONS REACHED 3 THE VALUE OF AN EXHIBIT OF THE WORK OF THE PUPILS IN MATHE MATICS 4 THE PLACE AND VALUE OF MATHEMATICAL CLUBS IN THE SCHOOL 5 THE VALUE OF MATHEMATICAL CONTESTS BETWEEN CLASSES OR SCHOOLS CARRIED ON IN MUCH THE SAME FASHION AS A CONTEST IN PUBLIC SPEAKING EVERY STUDENT IN THE METHODS COURSE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE A TERM PAPER ON A SUBJECT THAT HAS AS CONCRETE AND VALUABLE A SETTING AS POSSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE STUDENTS IN THE SPECIALMETHODS COURSE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA IS VISITING EVERY DAY A THIRDYEAR CLASS WHICH IS TAKING UNIFIED MATHEMATICS AND FOR HIS TERM PAPER HE IS GOING TO GIVE HIS OPINION AS TO THE ADVISABILITY OF UNIFYING THE ALGEBRA AND TRIGONOMETRY IN THE THIRD YEAR AT THE CLOSE OF THE SEMESTER SURELY SOME WRITTEN TEST SHOULD BE REQUIRED OF ALL STUDENTS THIS TEST SHOULD BE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT FROM THE RESULTS THE INSTRUCTOR MAY BE ABLE TO FIND OUT THOSE WHO HAVE REALLY GRASPED THE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THE COURSE AND GIVE THE PROPER JUSTICE WHERE CREDIT IS DUE A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID FOR THE SPECIALMETHODS COURSE IN MATHEMATICS APPLIES EQUALLY WELL TO THE SPECIALMETHODS COURSES IN THE OTHER SUBJECTS IN ANY EVENT IT IS THE HOPE OF THE WRITER THAT WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID HERE WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS FINAL BUT ONLY AS TENTATIVE

125VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER THE ACT FORBIDDEN IS NOT AN OFFENCE AGAINST THE COMMONWEALTH IT IS THE VIOLATION OF A CITY ORDINANCE WHICH THE STATE IN THE CHARTER WHICH IT CONFERRED UPON THE CITY AUTHORIZES IT TO PUNISH BY THE IMPOSI TION OF A FINE NOT EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND WHICH THE CITY BY ITS ORDINANCE PUNISHES BY IMPOSITION OF A FINE OF NOT LESS THAN FIVE DOLLARS NOR MORE THAN TWENTY DOLLARS THE CHARTER IS THE AUTHORITY TO THE CITY TO PASS THE ORDINANCE AND THE ORDINANCE IS THE EXECUTION OF THE POWER CONFERRED BY THE CHARTER IT REMAINS ALWAYS HOWEVER VIOLATION OF THE POLICE REGULATION OF THE CITY AND NOT A CRIME OF DEGREE AGAINST THE PEACE AND DIGNITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH IT IS WELL SETTLED THAT UNLESS THE POWER TO IMPRISON BE PLAINLY GIVEN IT DOES NOT EXIST AND WHEN GIVEN BEFORE IT CAN BE EXERCISED THERE MUST BE A JUDICAL ASCERTAINMENT BY A COMPETENT TRIBUNAL OR MAGISTRATE OF THE GUILT OF THE PARTY ACCUSED 1 DILLON ON MUN CORP 4TH ED SEC 353 AND WHERE A

51 GA 639 A MUNICIPAL COR PORATION WAS AUTHORIZED BY ITS CHARTER TO MAKE BYLAWS AND PUNISH THEIR INFRACTION BY FINE OR IMPRISONMENT HELD THAT THIS DID NOT AUTHORIZE IMPRISONMENT FOR NONPAYMENT OF A FINE IMPOSED BY AN ORDI NANCE THE CASE OF SLESSMAN V CROZIER 80 IND 487 IS EVEN MORE STRINGENT FOR IN THAT CASE THE CHARTER AUTHORIZED THE CITY AMONG OTHER THINGS TO RESTRAIN FROM RUNNING AT LARGE

THEIR STREETS OR OTHER PUBLIC PLACES IN STATE V BRIGHT 38 LA ANN 1 IT IS HELD THAT A MUNICIPAL COR PORATION HAS NO RIGHT TO ENFORCE OBEDIENCE TO THE ORDINANCES WHICH IT HAS THE POWER TO PASS BY FINE OR IMPRISONMENT OR OTHER PENALTY UNLESS THAT RIGHT HAS BEEN UNQUESTIONABLY CONFERRED BY THE LAWGIVER THE REASON GIVEN IS THAT THE PUNISHMENT OF A CITIZEN FOR THE COMMISSION OR OMISSION OF AN ACT IS A PREROGATIVE WHICH APPERTAINS TO THE SOVEREIGN ONLY IT IS SETTLED IN ENGLAND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF MAGNA CHARTA THAT WITHOUT THE EXPRESS SANCTION OF PARLIAMENT NO BYLAW CAN BE ENFORCED BY DISFRANCHISEMENT OF THE OFFENDER OR BY HIS IMPRISONMENT OR BY FORFEITURE OF HIS GOODS OR PROPERTY UNDER INCI DENTAL POWER TO PASS BYLAWS A CORPORATION MAY IN ENGLAND ANNEX PECUNIARY PENALTIES OF A CERTAIN FIXED AND REASONABLE CHARACTER BUT WITHOUT EXPRESS AUTHORITY GIVEN BY A STATUTE THE ONLY PENALTY IT CAN PRESCRIBE IS A PECUNIARY ONE USUALLY CALLED A FINE 1 DILLON SEC 336 THE COURT DID NOT ERR IN GRANTING THE FIRST INSTRUCTION THE SECOND INSTRUCTION EMBRACES A PROPOSITION IF POSSIBLE EVEN LESS OBNOXIOUS TO OBJECTION VIZ THAT THE DEFENDANTS HAD NO RIGHT IN THEIR CAPACITY AS INDIVIDUALS TO GIVE SUCH ORDER THE THIRD INSTRUCTION DIRECTS THE JURY THAT IF THEY BELIEVE FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENDANTS WHETHER ACTING AS THE BOARD OF POLICE COMMISSIONERS OR AS INDIVIDUALS DID ISSUE AN ORDER FOR THE ARREST OF THE PLAINTIFF FOR SO WEARING SUCH A UNIFORM AND THAT BECAUSE OF SUCH ORDER SO ISSUED THE SAID PLAINTIFF WAS ARRESTED AND IMPRISONED THEN THEY MUST FIND FOR THE PLAINTIFF THE PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR CONTEND THAT THEY WERE ACTING IN A QUASI JUDICIAL CAPACITY AND ARE THEREFORE PRO TECTED FROM LIABILITY THEREFOR IT IS TRUE AS DECIDED IN JENKINS V WALDRON 11 JOHN 114 THAT  OFFICERS REQUIRED BY LAW TO EXERCISE THEIR JUDGMENTS ARE NOT ANSWER ABLE FOR MISTAKES IN LAW OR MERE ERRORS IN JUDGMENT WITHOUT ANY FRAUD OR MALICE BUT IN ORDER THAT OFFICERS JUDICIAL OR OTHERWISE MAY CLAIM IMNMUNITY FOR THEIR ACTS THEY MUST KEEP WITHIN THE LIMIT OF THE JURISDICTION ASSIGNED TO THEM BY LAW EVERY JUDICIAL OFFICER WHETHER THE GRADE BE HIGH OR LOW MUST TAKE CARE BEFORE ACTING TO INFORM HIMSELF WHETHER THE CIRCUMSTANCES JUSTIFY HIS EXERCISE OF THE JUDICIAL FUNCTION A JUDGE IS NOT SUCH AT ALL TIMES AND FOR ALL PURPOSES WHEN HE ACTS HE MUST BE CLOTHED WITH JURISDICTION AND ACTING WITHOUT THIS HE IS BUT THE INDIVIDUAL FALSELY 1897 127VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ASSUMING AN AUTHORITY HE DOES NOT POSSESS THE OFFICER IS THE JUDGE IN THE CASES IN WHICH THE LAW HAS EMPOWERED HIM TO ACT AND IN RE SPECT TO PERSONS LAWFULLY BROUGHT BEFORE HIM BUT HE IS NOT JUDGE WHEN HE ASSUMES TO DECIDE CASES OF A CLASS WHICH THE LAW WITHHOLDS FROM HIS COGNIZANCE OR CASES BETWEEN PERSONS WHO ARE NOT EITHER ACTUALLY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY LEFORE HIM FOR THE PURPOSE NEITHER IS HE EXERCISING THE JUDICIAL FUNCTION WHEN BEING EMPOWERED TO ENTER ONE JUDGMENT OR MAKE ONE ORDER HE ENTERS OR MAKES ONE WHOLLY DIFFERENT IN NATURE WHEN HE DOES THIS HE STEPS OVER THE BOUNDARY OF HIS JUDICIAL AUTHOR ITY AND IS AS MUCH OUT OF THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW IN RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR ACT AS IF HE HELD NO OFFICE AT ALL COOLEY ON TORTS 2D ED P 486 IT IS UNIVERSALLY CONCEDED THAT WHEN INFERIOR COURTS OR JUDICIAL OFFICERS ACT WITHOUT JURISDICTION THE LAW CAN GIVE THEM NO PROTECTION WHATEVER COOLEY ON TORTS P 489 THE PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR CAN FIND NO SHELTER UNDER THE PRINCIPLE THEY HAVE INVOKED THEY WERE NOT JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND THE OFFENCE COM PLAINED OF WAS NOT A JUDICIAL ACT THE FAULT OF WHICH THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR WAS GUILTY IF INDEED IT BE A FAULT HAD NOT BEEN COMMITTED WHEN THE ORDER FOR HIS ARREST WAS ISSUED TO THE POLICE FORCE OF NORFOLK NOR WAS THERE ANY AUTHORITY OF LAW FOR HIS ARREST AND IMPRISONMENT FOR WEARING THE UNIFORM OF A POLICEMAN GRANTING THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF A VIOLATION OF THE ORDINANCE THE CITY HAD NO POWER TO PUNISH THE OFFENCE BY IMPRISONMENT BUT BY A FINE ONLY SO THAT THE ARREST AND IMPRISONMENT WAS WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION AND EXCUSE THERE WAS NO ERROR IN THE THIRD INSTRUCTION THE FOURTH INSTRUCTION TELLS THE JURY THAT AN IMPROPER MOTIVE MAY BE INFERRED FROM A WRONGFUL ACT BASED UPON NO REASONABLE GROUND AND THAT SUCH IMPROPER MOTIVE CONSTITUTES MALICE IN LAW THAT THE ACT NEED NOT BE PROMPTED BY ANGER MALEVOLENCE OR VINDICTIVE NESS BUT SUCH INFERENCE OF MALICE MAY BE REMOVED BY THE EVIDENCE THIS IS A CORRECT DEFINITION OF MALICE IN AN ACTION FOR FALSE IMPRISON MENT SEE FORBES  ALLERS V HAGMAN 75 VA 168 THE FIFTH INSTRUCTION IS AS TO THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES AND THE ELE MENTS OF DAMAGE TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE JURY THEY ARE TOLD THAT THE DAMAGES AWARDED MUST BE COMPENSATORY FOR THE LOSS OF TIME FOR THE SUFFERING BODILY AND MENTAL SUSTAINED BY REASON OF SUCH WRONGFUL ACT OR ACTS AND FOR EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCURING DISCHARGE FROM RE STRAINT INCLUDING A REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEE THE JURY ARE THEN INSTRUCTED THAT IF THEY BELIEVE THE ACT TO HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY THE 128 JUNEBOLTON V VELLINES DEFENDANTS WITH MALICE THEY MAY ALSO AWARD TO THE PLAINTIFF PUNITIVE DAMAGES THIS INSTRUCTION IS UNOBJECTIONABLE WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY THE COURT CORRECTLY PROPOUND THE LAW AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ASKED FOR BY THE PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR AND REFUSED BY THE COURT WERE PROPERLY REFUSED THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR WHO HAD BEEN CAP TAIN OF THE POLICE OF THE CITY OF NORFOLK WHOSE TERM OF OFFICE HAD EX PIRED BUT WHO HONESTLY BELIEVED THAT HIS OFFICIAL LIFE WAS EXTENDED BY LAW UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR HAD QUALIFIED APPEARED UPON THE STREETS IN THE UNIFORM OF AN OFFICER OF POLICE FOR THIS HE WAS ARRESTED CARRIED THROUGH THE STREETS IN A PRISON VAN FIRST SEARCHED AND THEN KEPT IN PRISON UNTIL RELEASED UPON A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS FOR THIS INDIGNITY TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECTED BY THE PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR ACTING WITHOUT A VESTIGE OF AUTHORITY THE JURY AWARDED HIM THE SUM OF 1000 AS DAMAGES THE COURT OF LAW AND CHANCERY OF THE CITY OF NORFOLK REFUSED TO SET THAT VERDICT ASIDE THERE IS NO PRECISE MEASURE OF DAM AGES IN SUCH CASES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN IN MONEY THE EXACT EQUIVALENT FOR BODILY OR MENTAL PAIN THEREFORE WHERE THEY ARE ELEMENTS OF DAMAGE TO BE ESTIMATED BY A JURY THE VERDICT WILL NOT BE DISTURBED UNLESS IT IS SO EXCESSIVE AS TO SUGGEST PREJUDICE PASSION OR ILLWILL THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR HAD BEEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE PO LICE FORCE OF THE CITY OF NORFOLK IT IS TO BE PRESUMED THAT HE WAS A MAN OF CHARACTER AND CONSIDERATION IN THAT COMMUNITY HE WAS KNLOWN TO THE COURT AND JURY BEFORE WHICH HE APPEARED AND TAKING ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO CONSIDERATION WE FIND OURSELVES UNABLE TO DISTURB THE VERDICT AS CONTRARY TO THE LAW AND EVIDENCE THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF LAW AND CHANCERY OF THE CITY OF NORFOLK MUST BE AFFIRMED AFFIRMED BY THE EDITORTHE HEADNOTE OF THIS CASE APPEARED IN THE LAST NUMBER OF THE REGISTER BUT THE CASE IS DEEMED OF SUCH IMPORTANCE THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PUBLISHED IN FULL THE LIBERTY OF THE CITIZEN CANNOT BE TOO CAREFULLY GUARDED AND THE VIEWS OF THE COURT SEEM TO BE NOT ONLY SOUND IN PRINCIPLE BUT WELL SUP PORTED BY AUTHORITY 129 1897

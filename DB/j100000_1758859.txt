S MINTOT RESEARCHES ONASTRONOMICAL SPEC TR UMPHOTOGRAPHY AT the time of his death in November 1882 Dr Henry Draper had for a number of years been large ly occupied with very tedious and costly investiga tions connected with the photography of the spectra of the heavenly bodies his unusual adaptedness for the prosecution of which research conducted him to results of the highest importance With true scien tific spirit Mrs Draper has generously placed at the disposal of Professor Young and Professor Pickering all the data necessary for the proper publication of the work and in a monograph of about forty pages the former gives an introduction to Dr Drapers researches together with a description of the appara tus with which they were made extracts from the original notebooks and a list of the photographic plates in Mrs Drapers possession while the latter who took a number of these plates to the observatory of Harvard college in the spring of 1883 presents the results of his measurements accompanied by a dis cussion of the plates Dr Drapers attention appears to have been first turned toward spectrumphotography in 1869 and 1870 although his photographic work in other fields previously tothis time had been singularly successful His first work in science conducted while a medi cal student in New York and which related to the function of the spleen was illustrated with micro photographs of great excellence and very soon after taking his degree while on a visit at Parsonstown Ireland he became so thoroughly impressed with the photographic possibilities of the great reflectingtele scope of the Earl of Rosse that soon after his return home he began the construction of a metallic spec ulum of fifteen inches diamneter which was soon re placed by a number of silveronglass mirrors of about the same size the details of the construction and mounting of which formed the subject of one of the Smithsonian contributions to knowledge published in 1864 Seven years laterhe had completed with his own hands the entire conitruction and mounting of a twentyeight inch silveredglass mirror with NCE VOL III No 71 which he obtained in May 1872 his first photographs of the spectrum of a Lyrae by merely inserting a quartz prism in the path of the rays just inside the focus of the small mirror and employing neither slit nor lenses Three months afterward the same method secured for him plates showing four lines in the spectrum of the same star For two or three years following Dr Drapers time was for the most part occupied with other lines of work connected with investigations of the solar spectrum and the superintendence of the photographic preparations for the transit of Venus of 1874 He returned to the subject of stellar spectra in 1876 obtaining a num ber of photographs with a fine twelveinch refractor by Alvan Clark  Sons This instrument now the lesser telescope of the Lick observatory was re placed in Dr Drapers establishment in 1880 by an eleveninch Clark refractor which was provided with a correctinglens fitted to be placed in front of the objectglass to adapt it to photographic work This instrument was mounted on the same set of axes with the twentyeight inch Cassegrain mirror as were also a finder of five inches aperture and one of two inches all of which are well shown in the picture of the telescopes in the Hastings observatory vol i of Science p 31 Dr Drapers eminent successes in celestial photog raphy were due in large degree to his own skill and discoveries in the manipulation of the sensitized plates Until 1879 wet collodion plates were used in all his experiments but after that time he em ployed exclusively the dry plates made by Wratten  Wainwright to the admirable performance of which in the hands of Dr Huggins his attention was called by that distinguished astronomical physicist on a visit of Dr Draper to England in 1879 Professor Young directs attention to the fact that the investigations of stellar spectra were by no means carried on continuously but only during Dr Drapers summer residence at his countryplace and in the in tervals of other to him even more absorbingly in teresting researches and urgent business occupations The difficulties proved to be wellnigh insurmount able for at first the limitations imposed upon the time of exposure by the use of the wet process made it almost impossible to get impressions of sufficient strength a difficulty which vanished on the intro duction of the modern dryplate processes and an other difficulty increasing with the length of the exposure was that of securing a sufficiently accurate movement of the drivingclock No less than seven such clocks were constructed before he succeeded in getting a perfect one Its regulator was a pair of heavy conical pendulums so hung that their revolu tions were sensibly isochronous through quite a range of inclination The gearing and drivingscrew were constructed for the most part by Dr Draper himself with the utmost care and accuracy and Professor Young says that in its ultimate perfected condition the drivingclock was as good as any in existence be ing able to keep a star upon the slit for an hour at aa time when near the meridian and not disturbed by changes of refraction    lJUNE 13 1884 SCIE And besides the effect of changes of temperature upon the spectroscopic portion of his apparatus and the difficulty of securing nights on which the atmos phere would not cut off the actinic rays to an unusual degree not to mention the fact that the observatory was more than two miles distant from his residence these and many other conditions hindered the prog ress of the work Spectrographic operations are as Professor Young well says much more sensitive to atmospheric conditions than are visual observations As regards the spectroscopic apparatus a great many forms were employed the first of which has already been mentioned Later directvision prisms were used in the same way and spectroscopes made up of such prisms some with a slit some without and some with a cylindrical lens to give necessary width to the spectrum In the definitive arrange ment of the apparatus with which all the plates measured by Professor Pickering were made a re modelled form of Browning s starspectroscope formed the basis of the instrument the telescope and colli mator each having a focal length of six inches and an aperture of 075 of an inch The eyepiece and micrometer being removed a block of hard wood was fitted on in such a way as to carry the photographic plate a small piece of glass about an inch square and a small positive eyepiece was mounted on the block so that the yellow and red portions of the spec trumn projected beyond the sensitive plate into the field of view could be examined at pleasure It was thus possible to be sure that the drivingclock was running properly and that all the adjustments re mained correct The whole apparatus weighed less than five pounds and could be screwed on the eye end of whichever telescope it was desirable to use it with The development of the plates was usually by ferrous oxalate though the alkaline development and pyrogallic acid were both used on some occa sions The pictures were about half an inch long and onesixteenth of an inch in width extending from a point between the Fraunhofer lines F and G to a point near M Professor Pickering divides his work on these plates into three parts first the determination of the rel ative positions of the lines in the various spectra in terms of any convenient unit of length second from the known spectra of the moon and Jupiter a deter mination of the relation of these measures to wave lengths third a reduction of the measures of the stellar spectra to wavelengths and a discussion of the results The stars whose spectra have been meas ured are a Aquilae a Lyrae a Aurigae a Bo6tis and a Scorpii The spectrum of the first of these stars is remarkable for containing in addition to the intense broad hydrogenbands which characterize the spec trum of a Lyrae and similar stars a multitude of very fine lines which are easily seen between G and H in several of the plates but are too delicate to be satis factorily measured Dr Draper considered these fine lines very important as showing that Altair should be regarded as a sort of intermediate link between a Lyrae and Sirius on the one side and Capella and the sun on the other NCE 727 On the plates of the spectra of a Aurigae and a Bo6tis not only do the lines appear to coincide in position with those of the sun but their relative in tensity seems to be nearly the same Of the twelve lines seen in at least seven of the nine spectra of the moon and Jupiter every one is contained in the spec tra of both a Aurigae and a Bootis Of the fifteen lines which are so faint as to be contained in but one or two of the spectra of the moon or Jupiter only four are contained in the spectrum of a Bootis and but one in that of a Aurigae There is therefore no room for doubt of the correctness of Professor Pick erings conclusion that the evidence afforded by these photographs is very strong indication of the same ness of their constitution with that of our sun Professor Pickerings method of deriving his results from these plates is worthy of note here as indicat ing the great degree of confidence to which they are entitled To secure entire independence in the re sults the measures were completed before the reduc tions were begun The lines in each plate were measured without comparison with any map and no search was made for lines which appeared to be want ing When two similar spectra were photographed side by side care was taken to cover one when meas uring the other Under these circumstances the agreement in the measures of several plates is strong evidence of the identity of the spectra Appended to this monograph are three of the pa pers of Dr Draper reprinted from the American jour nal of

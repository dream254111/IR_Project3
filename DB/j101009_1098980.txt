Court of Appeals At Wytheville June 20 1895 1 CRIMINAL PRACICcEGrand jurychargeindictment Failure to charge the grand jury as provided by Section 3982 of the Code does not vitiate an in dictment found by them The provision is directory only as are also the provisions of Sections 3984 and 3991 of the Code 2 CRIMINAL PRACTICECharge to juryeffect on verdict The chaige to the jury should be given by the clerk under the direction of the court but if it ap pears that they were fully informed of their duties and no injury resulted to the accused the verdict will not be set aside merely because a part of the charge was given by the clerk part by the court and part by the attorney for the Commonwealth 3 CRIMINAL LAWCircumstantial evidence In order to warrant a conviction of crime on circumstantial evidence every essential fact or circumstance upon which conviction depends must be proved by competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt 4 CRIMINAL LAWPossession of stolen goodspresumption The exclusive pos session of goods shortly after they have been stolen raises a presumption of fact that the possessor is the thief unless when called on for the purpose he can account for such possession consistently with his innocence 5 CRIMINAL PRACTICECorrection of verdictsformsubstance Trial courts should see that verdicts are put in proper form before juries are discharged but if any change is made in the substance of the verdict the jury should be sent back to their room where they can untrammelled by the presence and influence of others find such verdict as they think proper The effect of a change in substance where the jury is polled and assent to it alluded to but not decided Writ of error to a judgment of the Corporation Court of the City of Radford rendered December 17 1894 whereby the plaintiff in  Reported by M P Barks State Reporter 1895 263VItGINIA LAW REGISTER error was sentenced to be confined in the penitentiary for two years and six months Reversed The opinion states the case A R Heftin S H Hoge and Mliartin Williams for the plaintiff in error Attorney General R Taylor Scott for the Commonwealth BUCHANA  J delivered the opinion of the court The first assignment of error in this case is that the court failed to charge the grand jury after they were sworn in and before they were sent to their room as is provided by section 3982 of the Code The record shows that the grand jury were sworn and were sent to their room and afterwards brought in the indictment upon which the plaintiff in error was tried and convicted There is no pretence that the grand jury was not properly organized or that the indictment is not good but the contention is that the failure of the record to show that the grand jury were charged by the court as to their duties vitiates the whole proceeding The failure of the court to charge the grand jury as provided by the statute did not cause any advantage to be lost right destroyed or benefit sacrificed to which the accused was entitled Where no prejudice can result from the failure of the officers of the law to comply strictly with the provision of a statute such pro vision is usually held to be directory Cooleys Cons Lim p 88 etc Section 3984 of the Code provides that the names of the witness upon whose evidence the grand jury make their indictment shall be written at the foot of the indictment or presentment Section 3991 provides that in misdemeanors the name of the prosecutor if there be one shall be written at the foot of the indictment when made In each of these cases it lhas been held that the provisions are merely directory and not mandatory and the ground upon which such de cision is based is that the failure to comply with the provision locs not prejudice the accused Dever v Commonwealth 10 Leigh 685 Williams v Commonwealth 5 Gratt 702 Shelton v Comrlmoqveath 89 Va 450 This assignment of error must be overrulel Another assignment of error is that the charge given to the jury which tried the accused was improper because partly given by the clerk partly by the court and partly by the commonwealths attorney The proceeding complained of was irregular and contrary to tle usual rtactice The court should see that its clerk undler its direction in 264 August1895 PORTERFIELD V COMMONWEALTH 265 forms the jury plainly what offenses are charged and embraced in the indictment and the punishment that may be inflicted for each offense While the charge complained of was contrary to the usual practice the jury were fully informed as to their duties and no prejudice re sulted to the accused from such irregularity This assignment of error must be overruled The refusal of the court to give instruction No 1 asked for by the accused is assigned as error The instruction asked for is as follows The court instructs the jury that unless they believe from the evidence that the portion of the knife blade found in the storeroom has been identified beyond all reasonable doubt as the same blade which was in the possession of the prisoner previous to the offense they cannot consider it or treat it as a circumstance against the ac cused  The accused was indicted for feloniously entering a barroom with intent to commit grand larceny and with the commission of that offense The evidence introduced by the Commonwealth is wholly circumstan tial One of the circumstances relied on by the prosecution was that a portion of a knife blade was found in the barroom the morning after the alleged offense was committed which it was claimed was part of the blade of a knife shown to have been in the possession of the accused very recently before the commission of the offense charged The evi dence upon this point it was claimed by the accused did not prove its identity with that certainty required by law and could not therefore be relied upon by the jury in order to convict It is elementary that the guilt of the accused must be shown beyond a reasonable doubt whether the evidence relied upon be lirect or cir cumstantial In order to warrant a conviction for crime on circumstantial evidence every essential fact or circumstance upon which conviction depends must be proved by competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt Chief Justice Shaw in Websters case laid down the rule on the subject as follows The several circumstances upon which the conclusion de pends must be fully established by proof They are facts from which the main fact is to be inferred and they are to be proved by competent evidence and by the same weight and force of evidence as if each were itself the main fact 5 Cush 295 52 Amer Dec 711 Starkie in his work on Evidence page 856 9 Am Ed says The party upon whom the burden of proof rests is bound to prove every single circum stance wliich is essential to the conclusion in the same manner and toVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the same extent as if the whole issue had rested upon the proof of each individual and essential circumstance 3 Rice on Ev sec 346 This rule must from the very nature of the case be correct For how is it possible to reach a conclusion that the main fact is true beyond a reasonable doubt when the material and essential facts from which it is to be inferred are not shown to be true with a like degree of cer tainty  The evidence introduced by the Commonwealth as to the knife blade was clearly for the purpose of connecting the accused with the offence charged and if it were true it was a very material circumstance against him The object of the instruction asked for and refused was to inform the jury that they must be satisfied that the identity of the knife blade had been established beyond a reasonable doubt before they could rely upon that circumstance to convict the accused The instruc tion does not state that unless they believe that the circumstance in question was proved beyond a reasonable doubt they must acquit the accused It only cautions them that they must not consider it as evi dence against the accused unless so proved If it was not so proved the jury ought not to have relied upon it as a circumstance showing his guilt and if they had no right to rely upon it because not sufficiently proved there could be no objection to the courts so instructing them It was the duty of the court to have given the instruction as offered or to have given a general instruction that every material circumstance in the case must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and if any such circumstance was not proved it was the duty of the jury to discard such circumstance in making up their verdict The court erred in refusing to give the instruction asked for and for that error its judg ment must be reversed The court gave two instructions to the jury on motion of the Com monwealth to which the accused objected The first was as follows The court instructs the jury that the exclusive possession of money recently stolen unaccompanied by a reasonable account of how the pos session was acquired creates a presumption that the possessor is the thief but such possession is not prima facie evidence of house breaking It is well settled in this State that if property be stolen and recently thereafter be found in the exclusive possession of the accused such possession of itself affords sufficient ground for a presumption of fact that he was the thief and in order to repel such presumption it is in cumbent on him on being called upon for the purpose to account for such possession consistently with his innocence Prices Case 21 Gratt 266 AugustPORTERFIELD V COMMONWEALTH 846 and authorities cited The instruction complained of whilst not in the usual form we think correctly states the law By the other instruction to which the accused objected the jury were informed that whilst the possession of stolen goods was not prima facie evidence of the housebreaking charged in the indictment it was a circumstance which they might consider in connection with other facts in determining whether he was guilty of that offense This in struction was not to the prejudice of the accused and is fully sustained by the decisions of this court in the case of Walker v Commonwealth 28 Gratt 969 and Granby v Commonwealth 86 Va 393 The jury brought in their verdict in the following words We the jury find the defendant A F Porterfield guilty of grand larceny as charged in the indictment and fix his punishment at confinement in the State penitentiary for the period of two years and six months This verdict was amended by the Commonwealths attorney so as to read as follows  We the jury find the defendant A F Porterfield guilty as charged in the within indictment and fix his punishment at confinement in the State penitentiary for the period of two years and six months and as amended and assented to by each member of the jury was received by the court over the objection of the accused The practice of allowing the verdict of a jury to be put in form in open court is a proper and in many cases a necessary practice but the amendment made in this verdict was not as to a matter of form but of substance By the verdict returned by the jury the accused was acquitted of feloniously entering the barroom and found guilty of grand larceny By the amended verdict he is found guilty as charged in the indictment which embraces both the offense of entering the bar room and of grand larceny The fact that the jury was polled and each member assented to the amended verdict would perhaps have cured the irregularity but as the cause has to be reversed upon other grounds it is unnecessary to decide that question and we are not to be understood as expressing any opinion upon it The proper practice in such cases is for the trial court to see that the verdicts of the juries are put in proper form before they are discharged but if any change in the substance of the verdict is to be made the jury should be sent back to their room where they can untrammeled by the presence or influence of others find such verdict as they deem proper Other errors are assigned but they are not of sufficient importance to require special notice 1895 267VtIRGINIA LAW REGISTER The judgment of the Corporation Court of the city of Radford must be reversed the verdict set aside and a new trial awarded to be had in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion EWING V LITCHFIELD AND OTHERS Virginia Court of Appeals At Wytheville June 27 1895 Absent Buchanan Jt 1 CHANCERY JURISDICTIONSpecific performancecontract to build a railroad A court of equity cannot specifically enforce a contract to build a railroad or to procure a railroad to be built by others And where the chief object of a contract is to secure the building of a railroad and one of the parties stipu lates that upon failure to build such a railroad he will pay a sum certain in money or will transfer and deliver certain stock a court of equity will not entertain a bill to enforce the transfer of the stock 2 CHANCERY JURISDICTIONSpecific peformancepenaltyforfeitureiquidated damages Upon the case stated if the payment of the money or the transfer of the stock be regarded as a penalty or as a forfeiture a court of equity will not enforce it if as liquidated damages then a full adequate and complete remedy is afforded at law and equity has not jurisdiction 3 CHANCERY JURISDICTIONSpecific performancepenaltyforfeitureliquidated damages In proper cases where parties have no other adequate remedy a court of equity will specifically enforce contracts but it will neither enforce a penalty or a forfeiture nor permit it to be enforced in a court of law nor will it permit a party by the voluntary payment of the agreed penalty to defeat the enforcement of the alternative contract 4 CHANCERY JURISDICTIONDamagesancillary relief A court of equity will not entertain a suit merely for the recovery of damages nor will it under take to give damages save as ancillary or auxiliary to some one of its recog nized subjects of jurisdiction and then only such damages are awarded as may be necessary to do full and complete justice by way of compensation 5 CHANCERY JURISDICTIoNForfeiturepenaltyliquidated damages In cases of doubt whether the provisions of a contract colstitute a forfeiture a penalty or liquidated damages courts of equity strongly incline to that construction which declares it to be a forfeiture or a penalty rather than liquidated dam ages For if it be construed as a forfeiture or a penalty it will entertain jurisdiction to prohibit either the enforcement or the voluntary payment of the penalty or forfeiture and will compel the performance of the alternative contract if a proper case be made but if it be construed as liquidated dam ages the jurisdiction of the court of equity is at an end  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter t Judge Buchanan had been counsel in the Circuit Court 268 August

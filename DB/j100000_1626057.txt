all that they can but the most that can now be done is to observe the weather in 1899 in the hope of getting some new light on the matter So far as the eclipse is concerned which will certainly take place at the predicted time it is possible and practicable to make calculations from the data in our American Ephemeris and to do this within a few days and in the coming months to make all need ful preparations of instruments and train ing of observers and with abundant spare time left I shall report to our trustees that the main effort to be made then will be towards photographing the eclipse as well and com pletely at both points as the time short enough at best will allow At Norfolk in Virginia and Ovar in Portugal the eclipse will be total long enough to be well photographed by instru ments costing but little more than a hun dred dollars for each station instruments which can be made useful in several directions and can be readily placed at either station The advantage of making the effort to observe at both places will be of course not that of making observations at the same time but that of following out a uniform set of rules both in America and in Europe These rules can be readily formulated and practiced beforehand with compara tively little trouble provided the astron omers can come to an agreement which I think will be an easy matter The process of taking the photographs is so easy now that no difficulty will arise from this and it will also be easy to train intelligent students into the necessary phys ical manipulations with the help at least of the necessary photographers who I pre sume will be readily brought to either sta tion As the object of the present paper is merely to indicate what is to be done I shall defer to another occasion any further details In this as in many other problems of practical astronomy the main require ment is merely to indicate in common lan guage the problems to be solved and it will be sufficient to leave further consideration of the matter to another occasion TRUMAN HENRY SAFFORD RECEPTION AND EXHIBITION OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES THE Annual Reception and Exhibition of the New York Academy of Sciences has come to be one of the most interesting social events of the scientific circles of the city This fine spring weather and a beautifully suitable hall combined with the zeal of the exhibitors to furnish instructive entertain ment to about three thousand persons The reception was held as usual at the American Museum of Natural History the first evening being reserved for members exhibitors and special friends and some 500 availed them selves of this opportunity to become better acquainted with their fellow members and to see and discuss the advances in branches of science other than their own Indeed the justification and benefits of these exhi bitions are to be sought quite as much in their broadening influence upon the point of view of specialists as in their possibili ties for the layman and amateur The Museum authorities are exemplary in their hospitality and the relations be tween this gigantic object lesson in science and the Academy are yearly growing more cordial This year it was possible to hold the reception in the new hall of American Anthropology west of the entrance on the main floor The room is finished but is not yet occupied by cases and permanent fixtures A more suitable and appropriate location for a scientific reception it would be hard to imagine 616 SCIENCESCIENCE The General Committee in charge of the various sections were as

any ohe prominent object such as Xrays still it was characterized by an excellent average of exhibits of sterling value and should give its visitors an illustration of scientific interest as distinct from the spectacular It would of course be too prolix to at tempt to give anything more than a few of the typical objects enumerated in the cata logue of some twenty pages The exhibit in Anatomy though small in space contained examples of most interest ing points The variations in the vermiform appendix in the hepatic artery etc The Harvard Lick and Yerkes Observa tories joined with that of

State Surveys including the Geologic model of the Yellowstone National Park made by the U S Geological Survey to go to the Paris Exposition and a relief map of the Adirondack Region made by Merrill A suite of crude petroleums and several others of interesting rocks together with large thin sections three inches square of rocks furnished interesting material for the geol ogist and petrographer

SCIENTIFIC BOOKS Lectures on the Evolution of Plants By DOUGLAS HOUGHTON CAMPBELL P D Professor of Botany in the Leland Stanford Junior Uni versity New York The Macmillan Com pany 1899 12mo Pp viii  319 Professor Campbell is probably the foremost of the small group of what may be termed the philosophical botanists in America and he is no doubt better prepared to discuss the ques tions taken up in this book at least in so far as they deal with the archegoniates and seed plants than any other of our students of plants Some years ago he brought out his book The Structure and Development of the Mosses and Ferns in which he treated the subject in such a modern way as to give new meaning to what had to too great a degree been mere dry detail In no uncertain words he traced the genetic relationship of group to group and the student following him was made to feel that the fact of relationship was real and necessary and not doubtful or shadowy In the little book before us the author dis cusses in succession the conditions of plant life the simplest forms of life algae fungi mosses and liverworts ferns horsetails and clubmosses gymnosperms monocotyledons dicotyledons geological and geographical dis tribution animals and plants influence of en vironment and at the end brings together his results in a chapter entitled summary and conclusions We can do no better in endeavoring to give our readers an idea of the authors treatment and conclusions than to quote a sentence here and there from his final chapter as follows All plants agree closely in their essential cell structure the typical cell having a cellu lose membrane and a single nucleus The lowest plants are mainly aquatic and it is ex ceedingly probable that this is the primitive condition of plant life  The peculiar group of motile green algae the Volvocinese probably represents more nearly than any existing forms the ancestral type of all the higher green plants These ciliated algae are also probably related to certain colorless flagellate Infusoria which in turn may represent the startingpoint for the whole group of Metazoa among animals It is not unlikely that the separation of the two great branches of organisms plants and animals took place among the Flagellata Starting with this primitive motile unicellular organism there have evidently arisen a num ber of independent lines of development result ing in very divergent types of structure  In these lowly organisms there is no clearly marked line between vegetative and reproduc tive cells  The increasing complexity of the plant body has been accompanied by a corresponding special ization of the reproductive parts  The origin of the Phleophycese or brown algee from free swimming brown flagellate organisms is by no means unlikely and if this be shown to be the case they must be considered as a line of devel opment parallel with the Chlorophyceee rather than an offshoot from these The relation ship of the fungi is still an open question  The ancestors of the higher green plants must be sought among the simple freshwater green algae The genus Coleochsete the most special ized of the Confervacese is the form which shows the nearest analogy with the lower 618 SCIENCE

NOVEMBER  I902 NUMBER 99 EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN ENGLAND VI THE PRESENT EDUCATIONAL SITUATION THE QUESTION WHICH UNDERLIES THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR NATION AS A WHOLE I MEAN EDUCATIONIN WHICH WE ARE LAGGING SADLY AND WITH WHICH WE SHALL HAVE PEACEFULLY TO FIGHT OTHER NATIONS WITH WEAPONS LIKE THE BOW AND ARROW IF WE DO NOT PROGRESS WE HAVE NOTHING LIKE A NATIONAL SYSTEM BUT A GREAT CHAOS OF ALMOST HAPHAZARD ARRANGEMENT LORD ROSEBERY AT CHESTERFIELD THE OBJECT OF THIS MY SIXTH REPORT UPON EDUCATIONAL MOVE MENTS IN ENGLAND IS TO GIVE A GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE SITUATION CREATED IN THE EDUCATIONAL WORLD BY THE LATEST ATTEMPT OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY NOW IN POWER TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF REORGANISING SECONDARY EDUCATION SO IMPORTANT IS THIS SITUATION THAT ALL OTHER MATTERS MUST STAND OVER TO MY NEXT COMMUNICA TION AN EXCEPTION MUST HOWEVER BE MADE IN FAVOUR OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TEACHERS REGISTRATION COUNCIL AND THE FOR MATION OF A REGISTER OF TEACHERS THE ORDER OF THE KINGS PRIVY COUNCIL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGISTER OF TEACHERS WAS PUBLISHED AT THE END OF JANUARY 1902 THE REGISTER IS INCLUSIVE AND WILL ULTIMATELY MAKE TRAIN ING A SINE QUA NON THE LIST WILL BE ALPHABETICAL IN TWO COLUMNS COLUMN A TO WHICH ENTRANCE IS AUTOMATIC AND WITHOUT FEE WILL CONTAIN ALL TEACHERS WHO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT CERTIFICATE UNDER THE CODE COLUMN B WILL CONTAIN TEACHERS HOLDING ONE OR MORE IFOR A HISTORY OF THE MOVEMENT LEADING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGISTER OF TEACHERS IN ENGLAND SEE NATIONAL EDUCATION PUBLISHED BY MR JOHN MURRAY ALBEMARLE STREET LONDON ENGLAND 649THE SCHOOL REVIEW SCHEDULED QUALIFICATIONS SUCH AS A UNIVERSITY DEGREE A TEACHING DIPLOMA ETC WHO WILL PAY A FEE OF ONE GUINEA WITH HALFACROWN FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT RECORD AGAINST THEIR NAMES A SUPPLE MENTARY LIST CONTAINS TEACHERS QUALIFIED IN SPECIAL SUBJECTS RANG ING FROM MUSIC TO NEEDLEWORK FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS DATING FROM JUNE I902 EASY CONDITIONS OF REGISTRATION ARE ALLOWED THEREAFTER THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED WILL BE MORE EXACTING CANDIDATES WILL HAVE TO SHOW FIRST A FULL UNIVERSITY DEGREE OR ITS EQUIVALENT SECONDLY RESIDENCE AND A YEARS TRAINING AT A UNI VERSITY OR RECOGNISED TRAINING COLLEGE OR A DIPLOMA IN THEORY ACCOMPANIED BY A YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A STUDENT TEACHER AND LASTLY A YEARS EXPERIENCE OF TEACHING AS A PROBATIONER IN A RECOGNISED SCHOOL IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A BETTER CERTIFI CATE OF TEACHING POWER THAN THE ABOVE TRIPLE QUALIFICATION IF THE MIDDLE ELEMENTTHE CERTIFICATE OF TRAININGIS GIVEN WITH CONSCIENCE AND JUDGMENT BY THE TRAINING INSTITUTION BUT IT IS JUST HERE THAT THE DIFFICULTY UNDERLYING ALL CERTIFICATES OF CAPACITY THAT OF DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN REAL POWER AND THE CONVEN TIONAL SIMULACRUM OF ITWILL MAKE ITSELF FELT HEREAFTER NO LESS KEENLY THAN IT IS NOW THE FRAMING AND KEEPING OF THE REGISTER IS ENTRUSTED TO A COUNCIL OF TWELVE HALF OF THEM NOMINATED BY THE CROWN AND HALF BY VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL BODIES AT THE END OF THREE YEARS THE REGISTRATION COUNCIL WHICH MUST REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE BOARD OF EDUCATION WILL BE RECONSTITUTED BY AN ORDER OF THE KINGS PRIVY COUNCIL WEAK POINTS IN THIS SCHEME ARE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT THE CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE THE REGISTERED TEACHERS THEMSELVES AND ASSISTANT MASTERS AND MISTRESSES ARE NOT DIRECTLY REPRESENTED ON THE REGISTRATION COUNCIL THE EXPRESSIONS RECOGNISED SCHOOL AND ELEMENTARY TEACHER REQUIRE DEFINITION AGAIN IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY THE A COLUMN TEACHERS SHOULD PAY NO FEE AND BE REGISTERED EN BLOC WHETHER THEY DESIRE IT OR NOT KINDERGARTEN MISTRESSES WILL FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO REGISTER BUT THERE ARE ALSO STRONG POINTS ONE GOOD EFFECT MUST BE PRODUCED EVEN BEFORE THE END OF THE THREE YEARS OF GRACEA POWERFUL STIMULUS TO THE CAUSE OF TRAINING IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE 650EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN ENGLAND HOW HEADMASTERS CAN ANY LONGER REFUSE TO DRAW THE BAR OF TRAINING ACROSS THE DOOR OF THE TEACHERS ROOM SOONER OR LATER THE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS SURE TO REFUSE TO RECOGNISE ANY SCHOOL WHICH IS NOT LARGELY STAFFED BY REGISTERED TEACHERS ALREADY IN ITS RECENTLY ISSUED REGULATIONS FOR SECONDARY DAY SCHOOLS THE BOARD STATES THAT INCLUSION OF THE TEACHERS NAME IN COLUMN B OF THE OFFICIAL REGISTER OF TEACHERS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE BOARD AS EVIDENCE THAT A TEACHER IS DULY QUALIFIED THIS WILL BRING A VERY POWERFUL SCREW TO BEAR UPON THE GOVERNING BODY AND ONE THAT WILL ACT AUTOMATICALLY AND PROBABLY WITHOUT ANY APPRECIABLE FRICTION IT WILL ALSO ACT DIRECTLY UPON TEACHERS WHATEVER ESTABLISHED TEACHERS MAY DO NOW THE YOUNGER GENERA TION OF TEACHERS WILL NOT RUN THE RISK OF ENTERING THE EDUCATIONAL MARKET UNPROVIDED WITH A CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL BE UNOBTAINABLE WITHOUT A TEACHING DIPLOMA THIS PROVISION HAS ALMOST AT ONE STROKE OF THE PEN TRANSFORMED TEACHING INTO A LEARNED PROFESSION WE SHALL NO LONGER AS IN THE RECENT CASE OF THE MERCHANT TAYLORS SCHOOL HAVE A RAW SENIOR CLASSIC ALMOST IF NOT UTTERLY INNOCENT OF ANY TEACHING EXPE RIENCE APPOINTED TO THE HEADMASTERSHIP OF A GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOL A TEACHER WILL NO LONGER BE DEFINED AS A MAN LICENSED BY THE ORDINARY A MAN WITH AN M A DEGREE A MAN SANCTIONED BY APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION AND THE LAYING ON OF HANDS OR A MAN WHO IN A FREE COUNTRY TEACHES BECAUSE HE CHOOSES TO BUT SIMPLY AND COMPREHENSIVELY AS A MAN WHO CAN TEACH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS DEFINITION EVEN BY IMPLICATION AS A DESCRIP TION HALLMARKED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY IS SO GREAT A TRIUMPH FOR ENGLISH EDUCATION AND ONE SO PREGNANT WITH THE MOST FARREACHING POSSIBILITIES OF REGENERATION AND REINSPIRATION THAT THE MINOR DEFECTS OF THE REGISTRATION ORDER IN COUNCIL SINK INTO INSIGNIFICANCE BESIDE THIS GREAT BOON SO LONG SOUGHT AFTER AND SO HARDLY WON I TURN NOW TO THE EDUCATION BILL FIRST I WILL NAME THE PARTIES INTERESTED IN THE SCOPE OF THE NEW BILL AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRESSURE WHICH STIMULATED A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT TO ATTEMPT REFORM THESE FALL ROUGHLY INTO EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND EDUCATIONAL GOVERNING BODIES AMONG THE FORMER ARE ONTHE SCHOOL REVIEW THE ONE HAND PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS ENDOWED BY PIOUS FOUNDERS OR LIVING EITHER PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY UPON FEES AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE PRIVATE AND PROPRIETARY SCHOOLS OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS OR COMPANIES IN A THIRD CAMP ARE TO BE FOUND THE PUBLIC PRIMARY SCHOOLS SUPPORTED EITHER BY THE PUBLIC RATES OR BY VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS AMONG GOVERNING BODIES ARE THE GOVERNORS OF ENDOWED SCHOOLS THE SCHOOL BOARDS WHICH CONTROL THE RATEAIDED PRIMARY SCHOOLS THE MANAGERS OF VOLUN TARY PRIMARY SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE AND PROPRIETARY OWNERS THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF POWERFUL ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF HEAD AND ASSISTANT TEACHERS OF BOTH SEXES IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS LASTLY THERE ARE CERTAIN PUBLIC PURSE BEARERS SUCH AS THE TECHNICAL EDUCATION BOARDS OF TOWN AND COUNTY COUNCILS AND VARIOUS TRUSTS WHICH MAKE GRANTS TO EDUCA TIONAL INSTITUTIONS WITH THE CONFLICTING AIMS AND MOTIVES OF THESE VARIOUS PARTIES I WILL DEAL LATER HERE I WISH TO DRAW ATTENTION MERELY TO THE FACT THAT TRAVERSING ALL THEIR CLAIMS THERE RUN THE NONEDUCATIONAL POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHICH SWAY THE ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND CANNOT BE IGNORED IN ANY ATTEMPT TO APPRAISE THE RELATIVE DISINTERESTEDNESS OF THE VARIOUS PARTIES NAMED ABOVE BEFORE WE GO FURTHER IT WILL BE WELL TO CONSIDER THE SITUATION WHICH CALLED FORTH THE BILL THE ORIGIN OF THE I902 BILL IS TO BE FOUND IN THE SITUATION CREATED BY THE ABORTIVE BILL NO I AND THE BILL NO 2 WHICH WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR IT IN 190I IT IS IN EFFECT HOWEVER AN ATTEMPT TO COMPLETE THE LEGISLATION WHICH CREATED THE NEW BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE IN I900 THAT LEGISLATION HAVING ESTABLISHED A CENTRAL GOVERNING BODY I E THE BOARD OF EDUCATION WITH A PERMANENT ADVISORY BODY TO HELP IT I E THE CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE LEFT UNCREATED THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WHICH SHOULD IN EACH ADDITIONAL DISTRICT ACT AS THE EXECUTIVE OF THE CENTRAL BOARD OF EDUCATION THE BILL OF I902 ATTEMPTS TO SUPPLY THIS OMISSION THE GENESIS OF THE WHOLE MOVEMENT FOR REFORM IS WELL SET FORTH IN THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRES SPEECH AT THE CORONATION DINNER OF THE COUNTY COUNCILS ASSOCIATION HE SAID IN EFFECT THAT THE INEVITABLE CON SEQUENCES OF THE ACTS OF I870 AND I889 HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN 652EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN ENGLAND WHEN THEY WERE PLACED ON THE STATUTE BOOK NEITHER MR GLAD STONE NOR LORD SALISBURY FORESAW THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIMARY EDUCATION WOULD CALL FOR THE REORGANISATION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION NOR THAT THE TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION AUTHORITIES WOULD UNOFFICIALLY ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE CALL WITH COLLISION OF ADMINIS TRATION AND RESULTANT OVERLAPPING WHEN THIS OCCURRED IT WAS OPEN TO THE GOVERNMENT TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE WARRING INFLUENCES A SINGLE CENTRAL AND SINGLE LOCAL AUTHORITY TO DISTINGUISH SHARPLY BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY GRADES OR TO LET THE COM BATANTS FIGHT THE QUESTION OUT AT THE COST OF THE RATEPAYERS UNTIL THE FITTEST SURVIVED THE GOVERNMENT CHOSE THE FIRST AND MOST DIFFICULT BUT ALSO THE MOST STATESMANLIKE SOLUTION IT WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO QUOTE THE BILL IN EXTENSO THE FOLLOW ING PRECIS APPEARED IN THE LONDON JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR APRIL I902 PRECIS OF THE EDUCATION BILL THE LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITY IS THE COUNCIL OF EVERY COUNTY AND COUNTY BOROUGH EXCEPT THAT AS

OTHER DAY WITHIN A TWELVEMONTH AS THE BOARD OF EDUCATION MAY ENACT AS REGARDS ELEMENTARY EDUCATION THE APPOINTED DAY IS THE DAY ON WHICH THE RESOLUTION OF ADOPTION COMES INTO FORCETHIE SCHOOL REVIEW IT WILL BE INTERESTING NOW TO CONSIDER THE RECEPTION OF THE BILL BY VARIOUS PARTIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHOSE OPINIONS WILL THROW UP THE FEATURES OF THE BILL AND REFLECT THE MULTITUDE OF PERSONAL AND POLITICAL BIASES WHICH THIS ATTEMPT AT REFORM HAS HAD TO FACE FIRST THEN THE PRESS THE LEADING NEWSPAPERS CONCURRED IN APPROVING THE BILL BUT UNITED IN CONDEMNING THE LOCAL OPTION CLAUSE THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN ONE OF THE BEST OF THE ENGLISH PROVINCIAL PAPERS DESCRIBED IT AS A GENUINE EFFORT TO DEAL IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER WITH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ON THE OTHER HAND THE PALL MALL GAZETTE A CONSERVATIVE EVENING PAPER CONSIDERS THAT THE BILL WILL SET UP A GUERILLA WARFARE OF A SINGULARLY UNPLEASANT KIND THROUGH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE COUNTRY THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE A LIBERAL EVENING PAPER RESENTS THE DISBURSEMENT OF PUBLIC MONEY FOR THE SUPPORT OF DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS AND THE ATTACK ON SCHOOL BOARDS LASTLY THE DAILY CHRONICLE WHICH MAY BE TAKEN TO VOICE THE WISHES BOTH OF THE RADICAL PARTY AND THE FREE CHURCHES DESCRIBES THE BILL AS VERY FALTERING AND TENTATIVE IN ITS MOVEMENTS TOWARDS COORDINATION AND VERY REVOLUTIONARY IN ITS ATTITUDE TO THE VOL UNTARY SCHOOLS THE OPINIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LEADERS OF EDUCATIONAL THOUGHT ARE NO LESS INTERESTING AND INFLUENTIAL THE BISHOP OF SALFORD A CATHOLIC AND DEAN LYNCH AN ANGLICAN APPROVE THE BILL SIR JOHN HIBBERT APPROVES IT AS A SETTLEMENT OF THE GROWING FRICTION BETWEEN BOARD AND VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS THE BISHOP OF CHESTER BELIEVES THAT IT WILL DRAW THE MOST VENOMOUS STING OUT OF THE COMPETITION BETWEEN DENOMINATIONAL AND NONDENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS THE REV HUGH PRICE HUGHES AND DR PARKER OPPOSE THE BILL AS NONCONFORMISTS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JAMES BRYCE SAYS IT IS NOT AN EDUCATION BILL BUT SIMPLY A VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS ENDOWMENT BILL WRITING IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HE CRITICISES THE BILL FOR NOT MAKING PROVISION FOR FILLING GAPS IN AND RAISING THE QUALITY OF EXISTING EDUCATION FOR NOT DEALING WITH TRAINING AND ABOLISHING THE PUPIL TEACHER SYSTEM FOR ALIENATING POPULAR SYMPATHY AND ENCOURAGING SECTARIANISM AND FOR APPLYING TO THE TROUBLE OF RURAL SCHOOLS AND THE ATTENDANCE 656ED UCA TIONAL MOVEMENTS IN ENGLAND AGE A REMEDY WHICH IS BOTH COSTLY AND UNCERTAIN SIR JOSHUA FITCH SAYS THE DOMINANT PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO GIVE THE DENOM INATIONAL SYSTEM A RENEWED CHANCE OF PERMANENCE THE BISHOP OF ROCHESTER REGRETS THAT IT LEAVES THE LARGER PART OF OUR URBAN AREAS IN THE HANDS OF UNDENOMRINATIONISM AND TRAVERSES TRUST DEEDS AND TRADITIONS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE A H D ACLAND CONSIDERS THE BILL WHOLLY INADEQUATE LORD ROSEBERY APPROVES THE MUNICIPAL PRINCIPLE ON WHICH IT IS BASED ARCH DEACON SANDFORD CONSIDERS THAT THE BILL NEGLECTS SECONDARY TO THE ADVANTAGE OF PRIMARY EDUCATION AND MAKES NO PROVISION FOR SUBORDINATING LOCAL TO CENTRAL INSPECTION WHILE THE AREAS FOR WHICH LOCAL AUTHORITIES MAY BE CHOSEN ARE TOO SMALL OF THE VARIOUS BODIES AFFECTED THE SCHOOL BOARDS NATURALLY OBJECT ENTIRELY TO A BILL WHICH MAKES FOR THEIR ABOLITION THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF ENGLAND IS JUST AS NATURALLY PLEASED WITH A BILL THAT WILL RESCUE ITS SCHOOLS FROM IMPENDING RUIN THE FREECHURCH PARTY DENOUNCE AS IMPOSSIBLE AND UNWORKABLE SEV ERAL FEATURES OF THE BILL WHICH ARE SAID TO BE FOUND IN FULL WORK ING ORDER AMONG OUR BETTER EDUCATED INDUSTRIAL RIVALS ON THE CONTINENT THEY DESCRIBE THE BILL AS A SCHEME FOR ENDOWING DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS AND REFUSE TO PAY ELEVEN PENCE IN THE POUND IN THE SHAPE PARTLY OF RATES AND PARTLY OF TAXES IN EXCHANGE FOR HAVING DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS CONTROLLED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY THOUGH FORMERLY THEY PAID TEN PENCE IN TAXES AND HAD NO CONTROL BUT THE INCIDENCE OF RATES IS MORE DIRECTLY FELT AND THEREFORE MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD THAN THAT OF TAXES AND THE FREE CHURCHES ALWAYS REGARDED THE ABSENCE OF CONTROL AS A GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH SCHOOLS THE ATTITUDE OF THE EXTREME AGRICULTURAL PARTY IS NATURALLY BASED ON THE PRIN CIPLE MORE MANURE LESS LEARNING THOUGH ALL OVER THE COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE COUNTY BOROUGHS I E BOROUGHS LARGE ENOUGH TO RANK ELECTORALLY AS COUNTIES THE AGRICULTURISTS RATE FOR ELEMENT ARY EDUCATION WILL PROBABLY NOT EXCEED TWO PENCE HALFPENNY IN THE POUND LASTLY WE HAVE THE PROFESSION THE NATIONAL UNION OF TEACHERS WHICH CONSISTS ALMOST ENTIRELY OF PRIMARY TEACHERS BUT IS BY FAR THE LARGEST ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS IN THE COUNTRY 657THE SCHOOL REVIEW ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE BILL AT THEIR BRISTOL CONFER ENCE EXCEPTING ONLY THE CLAUSE ON LOCAL OPTION WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN ABANDONED BY THE GOVERNMENT THE TEACHERS GUILD THE ASSOCIATION OF HEADMASTERS AND THE ASSOCIATION OF ASSISTANT MASTERS REGARD THE BILL WITH FAVOUR THE COLLEGE OF PRECEP TORS THE OLDEST ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAS NOT YET MADE ANY FORMAL PRONOUNCEMENT ON THE SUBJECT AS FOR THE FAULTS AND VIRTUES OF THE BILL SOME HAVE ALREADY BEEN CITED IN MY ACCOUNT OF ITS RECEPTION BY PUBLIC MEN AND PARTIES TO GIVE ALL WOULD BE TEDIOUS BUT A FEW MORE MAY BE NOTICED HERE THE OPTIONAL CLAUSE IN RESPECT OF PRIMARY EDUCATION WAS FATAL AND NATURALLY DID NOT SURVIVE THE ATTACK IN PARLIAMENT THE ABSENCE OF PROVISION FOR TRAINING HAS BEEN ALREADY NOTICED AND A CLAUSE SHOULD BE INTRODUCED EMPOWERING COUNTY COUNCILS TO ESTABLISH TRAINING COLLEGES THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITY SHOULD HAVE A VETO ON THE APPOINTMENT BUT NOT ON THE DISMISSAL OF TEACHERS IS ABSURD THE PERMISSION TO ESTABLISH NEW DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS WILL REQUIRE MOST JEALOUS WATCHING IF PUBLIC MONEY IS NOT TO BE WASTED THE CLAUSE PROVIDING THAT THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY SHALL BE REQUIRED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF TEACHERS SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO COVER DISMISSAL ALSO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE EDUCATIONAL COMMITTEES IS TOO INDEF INITE A FIXED NUMBER SAY ONETHIRD OF THE MEMBERS SHOULD BE CHOSEN FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE CORRESPONDING COUNTY COUNCIL THE COMMITTEE THROUGH WHICH THE COUNCIL ACTS FOR BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SHOULD BE DEFINITELY THE EDUCATION COM MITTEE AND NO OTHER EDUCATIONAL BODIES LIKE SCHOOL BOARDS SHOULD HAVE A RECOGNISED POSITION INDEPENDENTLY OF THE WILL AND PLEASURE OF THE COUNCIL SUITABLE PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR PUPIL TEACHERS BELONGING TO THE FREE CHURCH CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES ARE APPARENTLY NOT PROVIDED FOR E G THE POSSIBILITY OF A DEADLOCK BETWEEN A COUNTY COUNCIL AND ITS EDUCATION COMMITTEE IF WE NOW TURN THE SHIELD IT APPEARS THAT THE BILL CONCEDES IN PRINCIPLE NEARLY ALL THAT THE TEACHERS GUILD THE ONE EDUCA TIONAL ASSOCIATION IN ENGLAND WHICH REPRESENTS ALL GRADES OF TEACHERS FROM THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST HAS CONTENDED FOR IT GIVES ONE LOCAL AUTHORITY FOR ALL EDUCATION OUTSIDE THE UNIVER 658EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN ENGLAIND SITIES ACTING THROUGH STATUTORY COMMITTEES ON WHICH EDUCATIONAL EXPERTS WILL HAVE A VOICE AND VOTE FURTHER THIS LOCAL AUTHORITY WILL HAVE NOT PERHAPS AN ADEQUATE BUT AT ANY RATE A SUBSTANTIAL SHARE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED AND OWNED BY DENOMINATIONAL BODIES EVENING SCHOOLS WILL BE DROPPED AND NOT REPLACED THE WHISKY MONEY IS NO LONGER EARMARKED FOR TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND WILL THEREFORE BE AVAILABLE FOR BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION THE ARRANGEMENT WITH REGARD TO VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS SEEMS TO MANY A FAIR COMPRO MISE WHICH WILL REDUCE THE  INTOLERABLE STRAIN THE EDUCATIONAL SUPPLY WILL NO LONGER VARY WITH THE RESOURCES BUT WITH THE NEEDS OF A DISTRICT THE GERM OF POPULAR CONTROL PERMEATES THE BILL MEANS ARE NOW AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION IN ALL ITS BRANCHES AND A FIRM FOUNDATION IS LAID ON WHICH FURTHER LEGISLATION CAN BE BUILT ONE ITEM OF SUPREME VALUE IS THE ELABORATE PROVISION MADE FOR THE COMBINATION INTO ONE COMMITTEE OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF A COUNTY AND ITS BOROUGHS AND URBAN DISTRICTS WHICH MAKES STRONGLY FOR CARRYING OUT THE MAIN INTENTION OF THE BILL I E COORDINATION OF ALL GRADES OF EDUCATION OVER THE WHOLE OF A GIVEN AREA I WILL CLOSE THIS SUM MARY OF FAVOURABLE POINTS IN THE BILL WHICH I HAVE CULLED FROM VARIOUS OPINIONS BY TWO QUOTATIONS MR HANCE OF LIVERPOOL SPEAKING AT A MEETING OF THE SCHOOL BOARD CLERKS ASSOCIATION SAID THE BILL WILL SET UP IMMEDIATELY FOR FIVESIXTHS OF THE POP ULATION BODIES CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH ALL FORMS OF EDUCATION  AND WILL EXTEND TO EVERY CHILD SUCH ADVANTAGES OF EDUCATION AS CAN BE SECURED BY PUBLIC EXPENDITURE DIRECTED TO A GREATER OR LESS EXTENT BY PUBLIC CONTROL DR OLIVER LODGE PRINCIPAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM DECLARES THAT THE BILL IS A STRENUOUS AND CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORT TO LEGISLATE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION A STATESMANLIKE ATTEMPT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE NUMEROUS DIFFICULTIES THAT LET OR HINDER A NATIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM OF EDUCATION2 I COME NOW TO THE QUESTION WHY IS THE BILL WHAT IT IS THE ANSWER IS TO BE SOUGHT IN THE MOTIVES OF THE VARIOUS PERSONS AND PARTIES WHOM THE GOVERNMENTA CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT 1 LONDON JOURNAL OF EDUCATION JULY 1902 PAGE 435 2 IBID 659THE SCHOOL REVIEW COMPELLED BY THE CRUEL IRONY OF FATE TO GRAPPLE WITH ITS IMME MORIAL BETE NOIRE REFORMHAS ENDEAVORED MORE POLITICO TO CONCIL IATE THESE OPPOSING POWERS WHOSE WHIMS AND WISHES MR ARTHUR BALFOUR HAS HAD TO REDUCE TO A COMMON DENOMINATOR FALL ROUGHLY SPEAKING INTO FOUR GROUPS THE SCHOOL BOARDS THE POL ITICIANS THE ESTABLISHED AND ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCHES WORKING IN THIS MATTER TOGETHER THE FREE CHURCHES AND THEIR PROPAGAN DIST ASSOCIATION THE LIBERATION SOCIETY THE SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE ENJOYED THE RIGHT OF SPENDING FUNDED RATES WHICH THEY DO NOT THEMSELVES RAISE AND NATURALLY RESENT ANY INTERFERENCE WITH THE PRIVILEGES OF THE IRRESPONSIBILITY THUS CREATED PRIVILEGES WHICH HAVE NARROWED THEIR VIEW OF EDUCATION AND DRIVEN THEM ALONG GROOVES OF EXTRAVAGANCE AND FADDISM THEY WOULD HAVE THE GOVERNMENT STAND ASIDE AND LET THEM FIGHT THE CHURCH PARTY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC RATES KILLING THE VOL UNTARY SCHOOLS BY LAVISHING MONEY ON THEIR OWN THE SCHOOL BOARDS IN THE PROVINCES THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEFIED BUT THE POWER OF THE LONDON SCHOOL BOARD IS SEEN IN THE PRESENT EXEMP TION OF LONDON FROM THE OPERATION OF THE BILL MR BALFOUR HOWEVER THREW OUT IN HIS SPEECH AT FULHAM A HINT THAT THE LONDON SCHOOL BOARD WOULD BE DEALT WITH NEXT YEAR WHICH BEING INTERPRETED MEANS WHEN THE PRESENT FERMENT HAS SUBSIDED AND HE CAN SAFELY BRING THE LEVERAGE OF THE FAIT ACCOMPLI IN THE PROVINCES TO BEAR UPON THE PROBLEM OF THE METROPOLIS THE PRESSURE OF THE POLITICIAN IS SEEN IN THE READINESS OF THE CHURCH PARTY TO CONCEDE THE RIGHT OF DENOMINATIONAL TEACHING TO ALL CREEDS IN EXCHANGE FOR RATE AID TO THE CHURCH SCHOOLS IT IS FURTHER SEEN IN THE FACT THAT THE CLAMOUR OF PROFESSIONAL ASSO CIATIONS PRODUCED LITTLE EFFECT UPON THE GOVERNMENT EDUCATION QUA EDUCATION WAS OF NO INTEREST TO IT BUT A LARGE BILL WAS SPEEDILY FORTHCOMING WHEN THE WRATH OF A POWERFUL POLITICAL INTEREST WAS AROUSED AND THE CHURCH PAPERS BEGAN TO ACCUSE THE GOVERNMENT OF HAVING ENTIRELY FORFEITED ITS CLAIM TO SUP PORT OF PLAYING FAST AND LOOSE WITH THE QUESTION AND OF  NOT FULFILLING ITS WHOLE PROMISE THE PRESENT BILL IS DUE TO THE PARLOUS STATE OF THE VOLUNTARY I E CHURCH PRIMARY SCHOOLS THE POWER OF THE CHURCH PARTY IS SEEN IN THE RETENTION OF 66OEDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IAR ENGLAND THE DUAL PRIMARY SCHOOL SYSTEM WITH ALL ITS UNFAIRNESS TO TEACHERS INEQUALITIES IN SALARIES AND SQUABBLES OF SECTARIAN AND UNSECTARIAN FANATICS IT IS SEEN AGAIN IN THAT THE BILL MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO REMEDY THE CRYING INJUSTICE THAT FREE CHURCHMEN ARE SOLELY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR RELIGIOUS OPINIONS DEBARRED FROM ENTERING 36 OUT OF THE 44 TRAINING COLLEGES WHICH ARE CHIEFLY MAINTAINED BY PUBLIC MONEY THE BILL LEAVES A SERIOUS GRIEV ANCE OF THE FREE CHURCHMEN FULL REPRESENTATION ON THE MANAGING BOARDS UNREMEDIED THE INFLUENCE OF THE FREE CHURCH PARTY IS SEEN IN THE CON CESSION OF AT LEAST PARTIAL CONTROL OF THE CHURCH SCHOOLS BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY BUT AS ALREADY EXPLAINED WITH THIS THEY ARE NOT CONTENT THEY DESIRE AN ABSOLUTE EQUALISATION OF RATE AID AND STATE CONTROL AS BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS OF BOTH CHURCHES THE CASE FOR THE FREE CHURCHES IS SO ABLY PUT BY A LEADER WRITER IN THE DAILY CHRONICLE FOR SEPTEMBER 24 THAT I CANNOT REFRAIN FROM MAKING TWO LONG QUOTATIONS THE ROMAN CATHOLICS APPLAUD THE BILL BECAUSE IT RECOGNISES THEIR PRINCIPLE OF MAINTAINING AT THE EXPENSE OF THE STATE A CATHOLIC ATMOSPHERE  IN THEIR SCHOOLS THE CONGREGATIONALISTS DENOUNCE THE BILL BECAUSE IT TRAVERSES PRIN CIPLES OF CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY WHICH THEY HAVE EVER HELD DEAR THE BILL PERPETUATES RELIGIOUS TESTS IN THE CASE OF A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION IT DOES NOTHING EFFECTIVE TO REMEDY THE GRIEVANCE OF NONCON FORMIST PARENTS WHO HAVE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO ANGLICAN SCHOOLS MANNED UNDER THIS SYSTEM OF TESTS SO AS TO SECURE AN ANGLICAN ATMOSPHERE THE BILL WHILE PERPETUATING THE WORST FEATURES OF THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS INTRODUCES A NEW AND REACTIONARY PRINCIPLE INTO OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IT PRO POSES TO LEVY A RATE WITHOUT GIVING TO THE RATE PAYERS ANY EFFECTIVE CONTROL OR MANAGEMENT IT QUARTERS CHURCH SCHOOLS ENTIRELY UPON THE PUBLIC PURSE WHILE LEAVING THE CHURCH MANAGERS IN SUPREME CONTROL IN ALL THESE WAYS THE EDUCATION BILL CUTS DEEP DOWN TO ISSUES WHICH MEN RIGHTLY DEEM TO BE ESSENTIAL THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOPS FOR THE BILL IS AS INTELLIGIBLE AND LEGITIMATE AS IS THE ANGER OF THE FREE CHURCHES AGAINST IT  IT IS SOMETIMES SAID THAT AFTER ALL THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE MADE BY THE BILL IN RELATION TO THESE ISSUES IS NOT VERY LARGE CHURCH SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY FOR THE MOST PART SUPPORTED BY PUBLIC FUNDS WHY IT IS ASKED SHOULD IT BE A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE TO REFUSE TO PAY A RATE WHEN NO SUCH SCRUPLES HAVE BEEN MANIFESTED ABOUT THE PAYMENT OF TAXES THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS AND MANI FOLD IN THE FIRST PLACE THIS IS A CASE OF  THE LAST STRAW SECONDLY IT IS A CASE OF A COMPROMISE BEING DISTURBED AND THIRDLY A NEW PRINCIPLE IS INTRO 66ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW DUCED NONCONFORMISTS HAVE CHAFED UNDER THE MANY GRIEVANCES INVOLVED IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE ACQUIESCED HITHERTO DOES NOT LOGICALLY REQUIRE THEM TO ACQUIESCE WHEN THE SUBVENTION TO DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS IS TO BE INCREASED AND WHEN THE LEVY OF IT IS MADE MORE DIRECT AGAIN THE PRESENT BOARD SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS THE RESULT OF A COMPROMISE NO DEMAND FOR ITS REVERSAL HAS COME FROM THE NONCONFORMISTS OR FROM ANY BODY OF THE LAITY IT IS BEING UPSET AT THE BIDDING OF THE ANGLICAN CLERGY AND THE ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS MR BALFOUR TALKS OF CONCESSIONS MADE IN THE BILL TO THE NONCONFORMISTS THEY ARE OF A VERY UNSUBSTANTIAL CHARACTER AND IN NO WAY MEET THE ESSENCE OF THEIR CASE AND THEY ARE FAR MORE THAN COUNTER BALANCED BY THE REST OF THE BILL AN ENTIRELY NEW SITUATION IS THUS CREATED AND THE NONCONFORMISTS ARE FREE TO TAKE THEIR STAND DE NOVO ON THEIR OWN FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THE LEVYING OF A RATE TO PAY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS INVOLVES ALSO A NEW ISSUE TO LEVY A RATE WITHOUT GIVING EQUIVALENT CONTROL IS A VIOLATION OF AN ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE OF FREE GOVERNMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF FIGHTING THIS MATTER TO THE DEATH THE FREE CHURCHES ARE NOW BUSILY ORGANIZING AN AUTUMN CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS EDUCATION BILL WHICH MAY END IN THE DESTRUCTION OF BOTH THE BILL AND ITS MAKERS FOR THE CRY OF RELIGIOUS EQUALITY WHICH EASILY COVERS ULTERIOR MOTIVES IS A POW ERFUL ONE AND HAS BEFORE NOW PROVED FATAL TO CONSERVATIVE GOV ERNMENTS IN ENGLAND SO FAR I HAVE DEALT WITH THE BILL AS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED BUT SINCE THEN IT HAS SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE ALTERATION IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE EXISTING TREASURY GOVERNMENT GRANT IS TO BE DOUBLED AND WILL NOW STAND AT ABOUT 7S 6D PER CHILD 4S BEING PAID TO THE SCHOOL AND THE REMAINDER APPORTIONED ACCORDING TO THE POVERTY OR WEALTH OF THE AREA AS SHOWN BY THE PRODUCE OF A PENNY RATE IN THIS GRANT OF 7S 6D ARE INCLUDED THE EXISTING SPECIAL AID GRANT TO VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS AND THE GRANT TO POOR SCHOOL BOARD AREAS THE PERMISSION TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITY TO CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF EDUCATION OTHER THAN ELEMENTARY IS NOW CONVERTED INTO AN ORDER BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF  SHALL  FOR  MAY PROVISION FOR TRAINING IS NOW SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED AND THE SPENDING OF THE WHISKY MONEY UPON EDUCATION HAS BEEN MADE COMPULSORY BY ANOTHER AMENDMENT THE NUMBER OF MANAGERS OF SCHOOLS IS FIXED AND REPRESENTATION IS GIVEN TO PARENTS AND PARISH COUNCILS IN COUNTY BOROUGHS THE RATE FOR SECONDARY EDU 662EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN ENGLAND CATION IS NOW UNLIMITED AND A SIMILAR RATE MAY BE LEVIED IN COUNTIES BY SIMPLE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD THE COWPERTEMPLE CONSCIENCE CLAUSE WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED SO LARGELY TO THE SMOOTH WORKING OF THE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION ACTS HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE SECONDARY EDUCATION CLAUSES IN SPITE OF THE OPPOSITION OF THE EXTREME CLERICAL PARTY THE FIRST EIGHT SECTIONS WHICH CONTAIN THE MAIN PRINCIPLES THAT OFFEND OR APPEAR TO OFFEND THE OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT HAVING PASSED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ADJOURNED FOR THE SUMMER VACATION AND THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL WILL BE RESUMED IN AN AUTUMN SESSION I COME LASTLY TO THE FUTURE ASSUMING THAT THE BILL PASSES IT CANNOT BE PLACED ON THE STATUTE BOOK MUCH BEFORE CHRISTMAS THE COUNTY COUNCILS CANNOT BEGIN TO FORM THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES BEFORE JANUARY 1903 WHICH LEAVES ONLY THREE MONTHS TO PREPARE FOR TAKING OVER FINANCIAL DUTIES AT THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR ON MARCH 3IST I903 IN THIS PERIOD OF PREPARATION EACH COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO SETTLE WHETHER IT WILL ASSUME THE IDEAL ATTITUDE AND ESTABLISH ONE SOLE AUTHORITY FOR ALL EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES IN THE COUNTY OR AVAIL ITSELF OF THE PERMISSIVE NATURE OF THE BILL IN THIS RESPECT AND ESTABLISH SEPARATE AUTHORITIES FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION THE GREAT OBJECT OF THE BILL WILL PROBABLY BE DEFEATED IF ALL GRADES OF EDUCATION ARE NOT PUT UNDER THE CON TROL OF THE SAME COMMITTEEAT ANY RATE IN COUNTIES WHETHER THE COUNCIL MAY OR MUST DELEGATE TO SUCH AUTHORITIES ALL POWERS EXCEPT RAISING A RATE OR BORROWING MONEY IS NOT MADE CLEAR IN THE BILL AS FAR AS IT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AS REGARDS FINANCE MOST IF NOT ALL COUNCILS ARE PROBABLY IN A POSITION TO ACT FORTH WITH BUT BEFORE ALL THESE THINGS CAN BE WE HAVE TO FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE BILL BEING THROWN OUT FOR REASONS ALREADY EXPLAINED THE FREE CHURCHES WILL HAVE NONE OF IT THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN THE CRY THAT HALF A LOAF IS BETTER THAN NO BREAD AND THAT THE CONCESSION OF SUBSTAN TIAL STATE CONTROL OVER THE SCHOOLS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH IS WORTH THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN THE RATES THE PRIME MINISTERS HINT OF A SUPPLEMENTARY BILL NEXT YEAR TO DEAL WITH LONDON ON THE SAME LINES HAS ARRAYED THE VAST INFLUENCE OF THE LONDON SCHOOL BOARD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THE LIBERAL PARTY HEADLESS AND INCHOATE AND UNPROVIDED WITH ANY ALTERNATIVE 663THE SCHOOL REVIEW SCHEME THOUGH IT IS SEEMS DETERMINED TO GO TO THE COUNTRY ON AN EDUCATION BILL ALTHOUGH THE ELECTORATE IS MOSTLY INCAPABLE OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN EDUCATION QUA EDUCATION AND THE SECTARIAN PROPAGANDISM WHICH MASQUERADES IN ITS ROBES THE URBAN POP ULATION MOREOVER HAS OUTLIVED ITS PREJUDICE AGAINST SCHOOL BOARDS AND IS NOW READY TO OPPOSE THEIR DESTRUCTION WITH THE SAME BLIND PARTISANSHIP WITH WHICH IT OPPOSED THEIR ESTABLISH MENT THUS THE BILL HAS PROVIDED ALL THE TRADITIONAL OPPONENTS OF CONSERVATISM WITH A RALLYING CRY WHICH MAY AT LEAST DURING THE BRIEF FERMENT OF THE POLLS STAND THEM IN PLACE OF A LEADER ON THE OTHER HAND ONCE THE CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT AWAKES TO THE UNION OF ITS HEREDITARY ENEMIES IT MAY AS OFTEN BEFORE CONSIDER THE ABANDONMENT OF A RELUCTANTLY ATTEMPTED REFORM AS FAR PREFERABLE TO THE RISKS OF EXTINCTION AT THE NEXT GENERAL ELEC TION THEN THE BILL WILL GO THE WAY OF ITS RECENT PREDECESSORS THIS WOULD I THINK BE ON THE WHOLE A MATTER FOR REGRET FOR THIS BILL HALTING AND IMPERFECT AS IT IS DOES AFTER ALL GIVE US MUCH THAT IS VALUABLE FIRST UNDER THIS HEAD MUST BE CITED THE MAIN PRINCIPLE OF THE BILL WHICH HAS SO FAR SURVIVED ALL ATTACKS I E THAT ALL SCHOOLS OF THE PEOPLE MUST BE BROUGHT UP TO AND MAINTAINED AT A CERTAIN STANDARD OF EFFICIENCY THAT TO SECURE THIS END EXISTING DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS MUST BE UTILISED AND SUPPORTED AT THE PUBLIC COST THEIR SECULAR TEACHING BEING SUBJECT TO PUBLIC CONTROL WHILE AS REGARDS THEIR RELIGIOUS TEACHING THEY RETAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AS ALREADY EXPLAINED THE BILL GIVES US AT LEAST PERMISSIVELY ONE LOCAL AUTHORITY ACTING THROUGH STATUTORY COMMITTEES LEAVENED BY EDUCATIONAL EXPERTS AND A SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC CONTROL OF DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS THIS IS NOT ALL ADVANCED EDUCATIONISTS WANTED BUT IT IS MUCH NEVERTHELESS THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN THE FUTURE WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PASTBUTTRESSES OF DENOMINATIONISM RATHER THAN AGENTS OF EDUCATION THIS WAS FRANKLY PUT BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOP OF CLIFTON AT THE CON FERENCE OF THE CATHOLIC TRUTH SOCIETY AT NEWPORT WHEN HE SAID THAT CATHOLICS DID NOT ATTACH SO MUCH IMPORTANCE IN EFFECT TO THE TEACHING OF ARITHMETIC OR GEOGRAPHY  THEIR PRIMARY DUTY WAS TO TRAIN THE CHILDREN TO BECOME GOOD CHRISTIANS AND GOOD CATHOLICS THE TRUE INWARDNESS OF THE BILL IS WELL 664ZEDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN ENGLAND STATED BY THE LEADER WRITER IN THE DAILY CHRONICLE ALREADY QUOTED  THE GOVERNING IDEA OF THE BILL IS NOT EDUCATIONAL THE IMPULSE BEHIND IT IS NOT DERIVED FROM ANY ZEAL FOR EDUCATION THE MAIN ISSUES WHICH IT RAISES ARE NOT EDUCATIONAL BUT POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS IT IS THIS ASPECT OF THE MATTER AND NOT ANY DISIN TERESTED CONCERN FOR EDUCATION WHICH CAUSES THE BILL TO EXCITE SO MUCH INTEREST THUS NOTHING REALLY SATISFACTORY AND FINAL WILL BE DONE UNTIL THE COUNTRY IS CONVINCED THAT PRIESTS AND PARSONS QUA PRIESTS AND PARSONS HAVE NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH EDUCATION IN ITS SECULAR ASPECTS WHICH ARE THE CONCERN OF THE STATE AND FURTHER THAT THE RELIGIOUS ASPECTS OF EDUCATION ARE BETTER RELEGATED TO THE SPHERE OF THE HOME AND THE AGENCY OF THE PARENT GUIDED BY THE PRIEST WITHIN THAT SPHERE THUS I HAVE SET FORTH WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE SITUATION IN THE RECENT HISTORY OF ENGLISH EDUCATIONAL DEVELOP MENTS AND CAST UPON IT THE LIGHT OF THOSE MANY AND DIVERSE OPINIONS SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL WHICH AT ONE TIME STIMULATE REFORM AT ANOTHER MODIFY ALL ATTEMPTS TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT AND EVENTUALLY ADD TO HISTORY SOME SMALL PORTION OF SOLID GAIN LOOKING UPON THE SITUATION WITH THE IMPARTIAL EYE OF PHILOSOPHY ONE CANNOT FAIL TO BE STRUCK WITH THE LACK OF GREATNESS IN CON CEPTION COURAGE IN EXECUTION AND RESOLUTION IN ACHIEVEMENT WHICH DISTINGUISH THE CREATIVE EFFORTS OF THE ENGLISH NATION HERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE A TRULY GREAT EDUCATIONAL REORGANISATION HERE WOULD A LITTLE TRUE COURAGE HAVE BROKEN DOWN FACTIOUS OPPOSITION AND HERE WOULD A MODICUM OF RESOLU TION HAVE CLUNG TO ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES TILL THEY HAD BEEN RECORDED ON THE STATUTE BOOK BUT WHAT HAVE WE REALLY OBTAINED A TRULY ENGLISH PRODUCT OF GREAT IDEAS CABINED CRIBBED CONFINED BY PETTY PARTY CONSIDERATIONS AND DISFIGURED BY THE FAMOUS BRITISH BRAND OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY YET IF THE BILL PASSES NO ONE CAN DENY THAT ANOTHER ADDITION WILL HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE SUM OF EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND FOR THAT WHILE THE IDEAL IST SIGHS THE PRACTICAL ENGLISHMAN WILL REJOICE AND BE GLAD WILLIAM K HILL GARDNOR HOUSE GARDNOR ROAD HAMPSTEAD LONDON N W ENGLAND SEPTEMBER 30 I902

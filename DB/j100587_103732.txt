III An Account of a Dropsy in the left Ovary of a Woman aged 58 Cured by a large Incision made in the Side of the Abdomen by Dr Ro bert Houstoun A U G U S T 1701 I was in the Country with a Patient the Lady Anne Houstoun Wife to Sir John Houstoun Baronet in the Shire of Renfrew ten Miles from Glasgow North Britain This charitable Lady pressd me with great Earnestness to visit a Tenants Wife who lay bedridden of an un common Disease which no Physician or Surgeon who had seen her could give any Name to or ac count for She informd me the ablest of that Coun try had forsaken her and declared her incurable so that I could lose no Reputation by the Result of my Endeavours In order to oblige this worthy Lady and in Com passion to the Distress of a poor Woman in so deplorable Condition deserted and given over on all sides I went determined to do every thing in my Power for her Re lief She was in the 58th Year of her Age her Name was Margaret Millar She informd me that her Midwife in her last lyingin at 45 Years old having violently pulld away the Burthen she was so very sensibly affected by a Pain which then seizd her in the left Side between the  and Groin that she scarce ever had been free from it after but that it had troubled her more or less during 13 Years together that for two Years past she had been extremely uneasy her Belly grew very large9 large and a Difficulty of breathing increased continu ally upon her insomuch that for the last six Months she had scarce breathd at all but with the utmost Dif ficulty That in all that Space of Time having quite lost her Appetite she had scarce eat so much as would nourish a sucking Child and that for three Months to gether she had now been forcd to lie constantly on her Back not daring to move at all to one side or other This Tumour was grown to so monstrous a Bulk that it engrossd the whole left Side from the  cus to the Pubes and stretchd the Abdominal Muscles to so unequal a Degree that I dont remember ever to have seen the like in the whole Course of my Practice It drew towards a Point Her being so long confined to lie continually on her Back having grievously excori ated her added much to her Sufferings which with want of Rest and Appetite had wasted her to Skin and Bone as the poor Woman herself expressed it Indeed she needed not to have told me so my Eyes were too faith ful Witnesses of her low and wretched Condition Scarce able to speak out she told me that having heard much of my Success she had strong Hopes of Relief provided I would try at least and do some thing in Pity to her Affliction I answerd her that I was willing but afraid in her low State she would want Strength to undergo a large Incision that in order effectually to relieve her I must be obligd to lay open a great Part of her Belly and remove the Cause of all that Swelling she seemd not frightened but heard me without Disorder and as if inspird with sudden Courage pressd and urgd me to the Operation I drew I must confess almost all my Confidence from her unexpected Resolution so that without loss of Time I prepared what the Place would allow and VOL XXXIII C with10 with an Imposthume Lancet laid open about an Inch but finding nothing issue I enlarged it two Inches and even then nothing came forth but a little thin yellowish Serum so I ventured to lay it open about two Inches more I was not a little startled after so large an A perture to find only a glutinous Substance bung up this Orifice All my Difficulty was to remove it I tryd my Probe I endeavourd with my Fingers but all was in vain it was so slippery that it eluded every Touch and the strongest hold I could take I wanted in this place almost every thing necessary but bethought myself of a very odd Instrument yet as good as the best in its Consequence because it answerd the End proposd I took a strong FirrSplinter such as the Poor in that Country ordinarily use to burn in stead of Candles I wrapt about the End of this Splinter some loose Lint and thrust it into the Wound and by turning and winding it I drew out above two Yards in Length of a Substance thicker than any Gellie or ra ther like Glue thats fresh made and hung out to dry the Breadth of it was above ten Inches this was fol lowed by nine full Quarts of such Matter as I have met with in Steatomatous and Atheromatous Tumours with several Hydatides of various Sizes containing a yellowish Serum the least of em bigger than an O range with several large Pieces of Membranes which seemd to be Parts of the distended Ovary Then I squeezd out all I could and stitchd up the Wound in three Places almost equidistant I was obligd to make use of Lucatelluss Balsam which was made by her Lady for the Use of the Poor with this Balsam I co vered a Pledget the whole Length of the Wound and over that laid several Compresses dippd in warm French Brandy and because I judgd that the Parts might have lost their Spring by so vast and so long a Distention11 Distention I dipt in the same Brandy a large Napkin four times folded and applied it over all the Dressings and with a couple of strong Towels which were also dipt I swathed her round the Body and then gave her about four Ounces of the following Mixture which I had from her Lady  Aq Menthae  ss Aq Cinnamomi fort  iss Syr Diacodii  vi M The CinnamonWater was drawn off from Canary and the best Cinnamon indeed it was the finest and most fragrant CinnamonWater I ever tasted of this Mixture I ordered her 2 or 3 Spoonfuls 4 times a Day Next Morning I found her in a breathing Sweat and she informed me with great Tokens of Joy that she had not slept so much nor found herself so well re freshd at any Time for three Months past I carefully attended her once every Day and as constantly dressed her Wound in the same Manner as above for about eight Days together I kept in the lower Part of the Wound a small Tent which discharged some Serosities at every Dressing for 4 or 5 Days But Business calling me elsewhere I left her having first instructed her two Daughters both Women who carefully attended her how to dress her Wound and told em what Diet I thought most proper enjoining em strictly to observe what I orderd Her chief Food was strong Broth made of an old Cock in each Porringer of which was one Spoonful of the Ladys CinnamonWater this was repeated 4 times a day and gave her new Life and Spirits After three Weeks Absence I called at her House and finding it shut up was a little surprizd but had not gone far before I was much more surprized when I found her sitting wrapt up in Blankets giving Dire ctions to some Labourers who were cutting down her Corn C 2 She12 She mended apace to the Admiration of every body thereabouts recovered surprizingly and lived in perfect Health from that time which was in August 1701 till October 1714 when she died in ten Days Sickness That this Tumour or rather Dropsy of the Ovari um proceeded from the Midwifes Rashness in pulling away the Placenta not knowing how to separate it from the Uterus skilfully seems to me plain from what the Woman herself told me and what fell out af terwards The Placenta adhering fast to the Uterus required more Art to bring it away than she was Mistress of which probably inducd her to use Violence by which she forcd down the Fundus Uteri so overstraind the Ligaments and all thats appended to em especially the Ligamentum latum of the left Side and its Ovari um which may be reasonably allowd to have been hurt in the Relaxation with the rest Hence the Ela sticity of these leased Parts was not only impaird but the small Lymphaticks rupturd so that the extravasa ted Lympha rushing out thickend and not being able to recirculate dilated the injurd Ovarium and thus increasd the Tumour and the Parts being already ex cessively distended and being no longer able to resist the new Influx of fresh Secretions rupturd also and by Degrees augmented to that huge and enormous Bulk Cyprianus in his Letter to Sir Thomas Millington gives several Instances of the Mischiefs committed by Midwives and other ignorant Persons When a Pla centa adheres then says he they tear all before em by pulling rudely they force down the Fundus Ute ri consequently do Violence to the Ovaria and other Parts whence follow Inflammations c Forestus l 28 Obs 80 says that an overbold Midwife pulled out the Placenta too hastily and that the13 the Woman presently fell into a Swoon and died im mediately Frederick Ruysch attributes the Cause of a Pla centas adhering close to a central Insertion of the Na velString into the Placenta in which Case it is hard to separate a Train of dismal Accidents attend those who not knowing how to do it venture to pull it a way by Force Vide Obs Anat 97 Dionis and la Motte have made the same Remark by the latter of which we are told of innumerable Accidents which he has known happen to Women in hard Labour by the Rashness and Ignorance of bold Pretenders who without Rule Precepts Practice or any suitable Instructions venture to practise Deliveries The aforesaid Ruysch has a remarkable Instance of the Effects of Violence in hard Labour The Case is curious Vide Obs Anat 63 Manget in his Theatrum Anat tells us that in all hard Labours where the Placenta sticks the Li gaments suffer more or less by a rash and ignorant Way of Pulling Examples of which see in Plateruss Obs lib 3 Bartholin Cent 2 Hist 91 Cent 5 Hist 19 Marchett Anat cap 7 and others of which Blasius has given us an ample List in his Commenta ries on Veslingius He likewise tells us that the Ovaria grow to a wonderful Bulk and contain such a huge Quantity of Liquor that they become dropsical whereof Skencki us in his Obs has recorded many Examples as hath Riolan and many others Munnicks in his Bibliothec Anat gives us the Hi story of a large Dropsy of the right Ovarium Mortgagni has told us that he has often met with large Vesicles in the Ovaria and in morbid Bodies sometimes full of purulent Matter Sylvius14 Sylvius Ex lymphaticis laesis tam Virilium quam Muliebrium Testiculorum c Hydrops particularis excitari potest Veslingius cap 7 has often met with large Tu mours from Obstructions in the Ovaria of Women Vesalius found in the right Ovarium 9 or 10 Glan dules like Goose Eggs with Matter not unlike the Whites of Eggs or rather thicker Gul Ballon paradig vi found an Imposthume of the Nature of a Steatoma near the Collum Uteri The Wo man had a large Tumour on her Side 16 Years and had only one Ovarium which was shown as a wonderful thing At Westminster about two Years ago I opened the Body of a Gentlewoman about 60 whose left Ova rium of a great Bulk weighd vi  to which ad herd several Hydatides like Pullets Eggs Hildan mentions an Hydropick Tumour of the right Ovarium of a prodigious bulk stuffd with Hair vide Gul Fab Hild Cent 5 Obs 48 Greg Horst Tom 2 l 4 Ob 53 Ruysch Obs Anat 17 A Dropsie says he of the Ovarium or if you please of the Eggs is an Affection or Disease well enough known to others but I am afraid not so well considerd Authors have agreed to call it Hydatis with which name I shall rest satisfied provided we agree about the subject of the Di stemper I observe this most frequently if not al ways to be the Eggs but so changd and sometimes swelld to such a Bulk that I have often seen them larger than a Childs Head Drelincourt has given us a very full and exact Ac count of a Dropsie of the left Ovarium in a Lady of 35 Years The Tumour of an enormous Bulk con tinud three Years The Body of the Ovarium with all containd in it weighd 60  It was nothing but15 but a number of little Globules clusterd together that disferd in their Roundness Form Colour and Consistence proceeding from little seminary Vesicles in a Cluster Some had Water extremely clear and liquid others a yellowish Serum thin others a glu tinous Matter some were as big as Pullets Eggs others bigger than ones Fist Let these few out of the many Instances which I could produce from Authors of undoubted Repu tation suffice to prove that the Ovaria as well as the Tubae Falloppianae Ligaments and Uterus itself are not free from Dropsies c and that they pro ceed from Obstructions often occasioned by rude and violent dealing with Women in difficult Labours which generally bring on a train of dismal Symptoms that sooner or later according to the Strength of the Sufferer after a miserable painful languishing Life end in Death The manifest Success in this uncommon Case may be of use and may shew that we ought not to dis pair too soon in Distempers that are seemingly most dangerous IV

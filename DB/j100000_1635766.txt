by general ob servations with an interesting discussion of the origin of cave life The latter is treated under three questions 1 How did these animals get into the caves 2 What was their condition when they entered 3 How have they reached their present state An swering these inquiries the author argues that cave animals originated from outside forms being predetermined to such cave con ditions as suited them that at first they differed slightly from similar forms but were better adapted than they for subterraneous existence and that they reached their present condition by gradual adjustment to environ ment modified by cumulative variations due to heredity Taking the monograph as a whole Mr Banta is to be congratulated on having given a most commendable example of what can be done by an exhaustive study of a small cavern and on having thus made a valuable contri bution to scientific literature HORACE C HOVEY SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND ARTICLES Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric

volume to his work on British vegetable galls1 There are chapters on the growth of galls characters and habits of the Cynipidme the British oak and collecting and mounting oak galls There is under each species a succinct statement com prising the English name of the gall the position of the gall the manner of growth color size time of year whether with one or many larvae where larva pupates time of is suance of fly and parasites and inquilines The insects are not described Fiftyfour galls of Cynipidse are treated and two of other insects The plates are photographs of 1British Oak Galls London Adlard  Son pp 170 68 plates 1908 the various galls often showing much varia tion in shape MR R E TURNER has completed a revision of the Australian species of a peculiar family of Hymenoptera the Thynnidle This family is extremely abundant in Australia about 400 species being known over 120 of which are described as new by Mr Turner Very little is as yet known of their life history a few bred from underground pupae of Lepidoptera or Hymenoptera The author severely criti cizes the classification of Ashmead but adopts most of the genera of Guerin and Westwood The characters at present used for the genera are found mostly in the sexual organs a better classification must await the discovery of characters associating the sexes Mr Turner excludes from this family the genus Anthobosca which he considers more related to Myzine With the exception of the genus zElurus the South American Thynnidae are of different genera than the Australian PROFESSOR WHEELER has written a most in teresting comparative study of the ants of Europe and North America3 He shows that there are fully twice as many kinds of ants in the United States as in Europe In both countries the antfauna is composed of two elements the boreal and the tropical The former is very similar in the two regions but the latter is very divergent owing to differ ent origins The difference in nidification of similar ants in Europe and North America is considered due to the amount of sunshine and it is shown that nests are more abundant in the interior of our country than in the eastern states There is a summary of the fossil ants of the two countries a chapter on the parasitic ants of Europe and on the myrmecophilous insects MR W SCHULTZE has an interesting article on the young of certain leafbeetles

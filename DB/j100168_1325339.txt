which they will be understood by that public in which they are to take effect United States v Isham 17 Wall U S 496 And as the phrase obtaining property on credit does not ordinarily import to the commercial public a bor rowing of money on time it is argued that procuring cash by false statements is not cause for denying discharge COLLIER BANKRUPTCY 6 ed I98 But the law recognizes property in cash And statutes defining the offense of ob taining property by false pretenses do not distinguish property in cash from property in other forms See State v Rowley 12 Conn Io1 Money then clearly comes within the terms of the Act Also in other sections of the Act property has been held to include money See Pirie v Chicago etc Co 182 U S 438 As nothing in the Act shows that the intention of Congress was to favor bankrupts who operate in cash the present case must be supported See In re Dresser  Co I44 Fed 318 BANKRUPTCY POWERS AND DUTIES OF TRUSTEE RECOVERY OF FRAU DULENTLY TRANSFERRED PROPERTY A trustee in bankruptcy filed a bill in equity to have a fraudulent transfer from the bankrupt to the defendant set aside The defendant pleaded in bar that the complainant with full knowledge of the facts had ratified the transfer by obtaining a judicial order requiring the bankrupt to turn over the balance of the amount received from the defendant for the transferred property and unaccounted for Held that the plea is a valid defense Thomas v Sugerman I57 Fed 669 C C A Second Circ The court relies on the doctrine of equitable estoppel as found in cases of conversion where a plaintiff having first brought an action ex contractu is held to have elected to pass title so that he cannot thereafter recover for the conversion Terry v Munger I2r N Y I6r The analogy is specious rather than convincing For the case does not seem to present an election by the trustee between inconsistent rights On the contrary he is but carrying out two statutory duties the one to collect property in the possession of the bankrupt the other to proceed against the bankrupts fraudulent grantees Indeed if he neglects the former he may be liable in damages It re Reinboth 157 Fed 672 see 21 HARV L REV 441 A trustees authority under the Bankruptcy Act is closely restricted and the sole provision for his passing title is under  70 c on a sale of bankrupt property It scarcely seems within the spirit of the Act to argue that a trustee by merely performing a duty has ratified the bankrupts fraudulent transfer and made a sale to the detriment of the creditors BANKRUPTCY PREFERENCES PAYMENT TO PUBLIC AGENT FOR HIS PRINCIPAL A bankrupt preferred a town making the payment to the town ship trustees an office created by statute and given power to sue and be sued on certain contracts

Appeal see 21 HARV L REV 214 CARRIERS CONNECTING LINES  LIABILITY OF INITIAL CARRIER FOR INJURIES OCCURRING ON CONNECTING LINES  The defendant accepted the plaintiffs goods for transportation beyond its own line receiving full payment and issuing a through bill of lading The goods were injured while in the possession of a connecting carrier Held that the defendant is liable St Louis I M  S Ry Co  v Randle 107 S W 669 Ark A carriers liability for injuries not occurring on its own line arises only by contract express or implied Whether such a contract is to be implied from the circumstances of a particular shipment is properly a question for the jury Gray v Jackson 51 N H 9 The present case however follows the English rule that as a matter of law mere acceptance of the goods for carriage beyond the carriers line constitutes an implied contract of through carriage In this country the greater distances and dangers making the hardship to the carrier seem larger apparently prevented its adoption generally and since the acceptance is obligatory this rule is certainly too strict Cf Nutting v Conn R R I Gray Mass 502 Van Santvoord v St John 6 Hill N Y 157 Nevertheless the shippers difficulties first in placing responsibility for a loss and then in suing in a distant state demand that a through contract should be readily implied especially as the carrier may to some extent limit his liability by express contract Therefore the result in the present case where a through rate was made and a through bill of lading issued each in itself strong evidence of a through contract seems correct R R Co v Pratt 22 Wall U S 123 CONFLICT OF LAWS  OBLIGATIONS EX DELICTO RECOVERY FOR CAR RIERS FAILURE TO DELIVER  The plaintiff delivered goods to the defendant carrier in Kansas for transportation to Massachusetts The goods were de stroyed in Kansas under circumstances rendering the carrier liable The plain tiff sued in Missouri ex delicto for failure to deliver and by the law of the forum if an action was barred by the statute of limitations in the state where it arose no action would lie Held that the right of action arose in Massachusetts and that the Kansas statute of limitations is inapplicable Merritt Creamery Co v Atchison T  S F Ry Co 107 S W 462 Mo K C Ct App It is generally recognized that a common carrier through whose fault goods are destroyed is subject to an action either ex contraczt or ex delicto Denman v Chicago etc Co 52 Neb 140 If the suit is ex contractu the validity of the contract and the extent of the carriers obligation should be governed by the lex loci contractus See IO HARV L REV I68 But if the contract is broken the right to damages is a cause of action arising at the place of per formance since it is there that the promisor breaks his contract See 17 HARV L REV 354 When sued in tort however the obligation of the carrier as well as its breach is governed by the law of the place where the acts complained of occurred Indiana etc Co v Masterson i6 Ind App 323 Had the plaintiff sued in contract for the breach his cause of action would certainly have arisen in Massachusetts Curtis v Delaware etc Co 74 N Y II6 But the defendant is under a duty apart from contract to deliver Raphael v Pickford 5 M  G 55I The cause of action founded on a breach of this duty also arose in Massachusetts and the present case is sound in so

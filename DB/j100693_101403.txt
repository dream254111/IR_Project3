J100693,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16651678,101403,THE MOTION OF THE LATE COMET PRAEDICTED,I206866,THE MOTION OF THE LATE COMET PRAEDICTED THERE WAS LATELY SENT TO ONE OF THE SECRETARIES OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A PACKET CONTAINING SOME COPIES OF A PRINTED PAPER ENTITULED THE EPHEMERIDES OF THE COMET MADE BY THE SAME PERSON THAT SENT IT CALLED MONSIEUR AUZOUT A FRENCH GENTLEMAN OF NO ORDINARY MERIT AND LEARNING WHO DESIRED THAT A COUPLE OF THEM MIGHT BE RECOMMENDED TO THE SAID SOCIETY AND ONE TO THEIR PRESIDENT AND ANOTHER TO HIS HIGHNESS PRINCE RUPERT AND THE REST TO SOME OTHER PERSONS NOMINATED BY HIM IN A LETTER THAT ACCOMPANIED THIS PRESENT AND KNOWN ABROAD FOR THEIR SINGULAR ABILITIES AND KNOW LEDGE IN PHILOSOPHICAL MATTERS THE END OF THE COMMUNICA TION OF THIS PAPER WAS THAT THE MOTION OF THE COMET THAT HATH LATELY APPEAREDHAVING BEEN PRAEDICTED BY THE SAID MONFIEUR AU A 2 ZOUT4 ZOUT AFTER HE HAD SEEN IT AS HIMSELF AFFIRMS BUT 4 OR 5 TIMES THE VIRTUOSI OF ENGLAND AMONG OTHERS MIGHT COMPARE ALSO THEIR OBSERVATIONS WITH HIS EPHEMERIDES EITHER TO CONFIRM THE HYPO THESIS UPON WHICH THE AUTHOR HAD BEFORE HAND CALCULATED THE WAY OF THIS STAR OR TO UNDECEIVE HIM IF HE BE IN A MISTAKE THE SAID AUTHOR DEDICATETH THESE HIS CONCEPTIONS TO THE MOST CHRISTIAN KING TELLING HIM THAT HE PRESENTS HIM WITH A DESIGN WHICH NEVER YET WAS UNDERTAKEN BY ANY ASTRONOMER ALL THE WORLD HAVING BEEN HITHERTO PERSWADED THAT THE MOTIONS OF COMETS WERE SO IRREGULAR THAT THEY COULD NOT BE REDUCED TO ANY LAWS AND MEN HAVING CONTENTED THEMSELVES TO OBSERVE EXACT LY THE PLACES THROUGH WHICH THEY DID PASS BUT NO MAN THAT HE KNOWS HAVING BEEN SO BOLD AS TO VENTURE TO FORETEL THE PLACES THROUGH WHICH THEY SHOULD PASS AND WHERE THEY SHOULD CEASE TO APPEAR WHEREAS HE EXHIBITES HERE THE EPHEMERIDES DETERMI NING DAY BY DAY IN WHAT PLACE OF THE HEAVENS THIS COMET SHALL BE AT WHAT HOUR IT SHALL BE IN ITS MERIDIAN AND AT WHAT HOUR IT SHALL SET UNTILL ITS TOO GREAT REMOTENESS OR THE APPROACH OF THE SUN HIDE IT FROM OUR EYES DESCENDING TO PARTICULARS HE SAITH THAT THIS STAR BEING DISENGAGED FROM THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IF HIS CONJECTURES BE GOOD EVER SINCE IT HATH BEEN OF 17 OR 18 DEGREES SOUTHERN LATITUDE AND THAT ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER LAST AND SOONER UNLESS IT HAVE BEEN TOO SMALL THAT HOWEVER IT HATH BEEN SEEN IN HOLLAND EVER SINCE THE 2D OF DECEMBER LAST AT WHICH TIME ACCORDING TO HIS RECKONING THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THE COMET SHOULD ALREADY AMOUNT TO 17 OR 18 MINUTES HE FINDS THAT THIS STAR MOVETH JUST ENOUGH IN THE PLAN OF A GREAT CIRCLE WHICH INCLINETH TO THE EQUINOCTIAL ABOUT 30 DEGREES AND TO THE ECLIPTICK ABOUT 49D OR 4912 CUTTING THE EQUATOR AT ABOUT 45D 12 AND THE ECLIPTICK AT THE 28D OF ARIES OR A LITTLE MORE HE SAITH JUST ENOUGH BECAUSE HE THINKS THERE MAY PERHAPS BE SOME PARALLAXE WHICH HE WISHETH COULD BE DETERMINED HENCESO HE GOES ONEVERY ONE WHO PLEASETHMAY SEEIN TRACING THE COMET UPON THE GLOBE THROUGH OR BY WHICH STARS IT HATH PASSED AND SHALL PASS ADDING THAT THERE WILL BE NEITHER CAUSE TO WONDER THAT HAVING DESCENDED TO ABOUT 6 DEG BENEATH THE TROPICK OF CAPRICORNHE HATH REMOUNTED AFTERWARDS AND SHALL GO ON5 ON ASCENDING SO AS TO PASS THE AEQUINOCTIAL AND PERHAPS PROCEED TO 15 DEGREES NORTHERN DECLINATION IF IT DO NOT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THAT TIME BY REASON OF ITS REMOTENESS NOR TO BELIEVE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TWO COMETS UPON ITS BEING SEEN AGAIN THE 31 OF DECEMBER SINCE ACCORDING TO HIM IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SO IF IT CONTINUE TO MOVE IN A GREAT CIRCLE HAVING HEREUPON SHEWED HOW THE MOTION IS TO BE TRACED UP ON THE GLOBE HE FINDSTHATACCORDING TO HIS CALCULATION THIS CO MET WAS TO PASS THE TROPICK OF CAPRICORN ABOUT THE 16 OF DECEM BER AND BEING ENTRED INTO THE SIGN OF VIRGO ON THE 20 OF THE SAME MONTH AND HAVING BEEN IN QUADRAT WITH THE SUNIT SHOULD STILL DESCEND UNTIL THE 26 OF DECEMBER IN THE MORNING AND THEN ENTER INTO LEO THAT HAVING ENTRED THE 28 OF THE SAME MONTH INTO CANCER AND BEEN A LITTLE AFTER THAT TIME IN ITS GREATEST IN CLINATION TO THE ECLIPTICK VID IN THE 28 DEGREE OF LEO IT WAS TO REPASS THE SOUTHERN TROPICK OVER AGAINST THE LITTLE DOGG ON THE 29 OF DECEMBER ABOUT 9 OR 10 OF THE CLOCK IN THE MORNING AFTER IT HAD BEEN OPPOSITE TO THE SUN 2 OR 3 HOURS BEFORE AND THAT ON THE 29 OF DECEMBER IN THE EVENING IT SHOULD BE IN GE MINI AND AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE NEW YEAR ENTER INTO TAURUS AFTER THISOUR AUTHOR FINDS THAT THIS COMET ACCORDING TO HIS ACCOUNT SHOULD PASS THE AEQUATOR ON THE 4 OF JANUARY BEFORE NOON AND THAT ABOUT 5 OR 6 OF THE CLOCK IN THE EVENING OF THAT DAY IT WAS TO COME INTO THE JAW OF THE WHALE AND THE 9 OF THE SAME AT 6 OF THE CLOCK IT SHOULD COME CLOSE TO THE SMALL STAR OF THE WHALE WHICH IS IN ITS WAY A LITTLE BELOW AT LENGTH HE FINDS THAT IT WAS TO ENTER INTO ARIES ON THE 12 OF JANUARY AND TO CUT THE ECLIPTISK ON THE 16 OF THE SAME MONTH ABOUT NOON AT WHICH TIME IT WAS TO BE AGAIN IN QUADRAS WITH THE SUN WHENCE DRAWING A LITTLE TO ABOVE THE NORTHERN LINE OF PISCES IT SHOULD IN HIS OPINION CEASE TO APPEAR A LITTLE BEYOND THAT PLACE WITHOUT GOING AS FAR AS TO THE MIDDLE OF ARIES IF SO BE THAT ITS REMOTENESS MAKE IT NOT DISAPPEAR SOONER HE CONTINUETH AND SAITH THAT THIS COMET SHALL NOT ARRIVE TO THE PLACE OVER AGAINST THE LINE OF PISCES TILL THE 10 OF FEBRUARY THAT THEN ITS DIURNAL MOTION SHALL NOT EXCEED 8 MINUTES AND NOT 5 MINUTES ABOUT THE 20 OF THE SAME MONTH AND THAT IN THE BE GINNING6 GINNING OF MARCH IF WE SEE IT SO LONG THE SAID MOTION SHALL NOT EXCEED 4 MINUTES AND SO SHALL BE STILL DIMINISHING EXCEPT THE COMET BECOME RETROGRADE WHICH AS VERY IMPORTANT HE WOULD HAVE WELL OBSERVED AS ALSO WHETHER ITS MOTION WILL BE ABOUT THE END MORE OR LESS SWIFT THAN HE HATH CALCULATED IT HE SUBJOYNETH THAT THE GREATEST WAY WHICH THIS STAR COULD MAKE IN 24 HOURS HATH BEEN 13D25 AND IN ONE HOURE ABOUT 34S AND THINKING IT PROBABLE THAT ABOUT THE TIME WHEN IT MADE SO MUCH WAY IT SHOULD BE NEAREST TO THE EARTH HE CONCLUDETH THAT ITS MOTION IN 24 HOURS MUST BE IN ITS LEAST DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH AS ABOUT 3 TO 14 OR 1 TO 423 AND THAT ITS MOTION IN ONE HOUR WAS TO BE TO THE SAME LEAST DISTANCE AS ABOUT 1 TO 10217 BUT THAT WHICH HE JUDGETH MOST REWARKABLE IS THAT HE FOUND BY HIS CALCULATION THAT THE SAID LEAST DISTANCE SHOULD BE ON THE 29 OF DECEMBER WHEN THE COMET WAS OPPOSITE TO THE SUNS WHICH HE DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER IT MAY NOT SERVE TO DECIDE THE GRAND QUESTION CONCERNING THE MOTION OF THE EARTH HE TAKETH FURTHER NOTICE THAT THE TAYL OF THE COMET WAS TO TURN WESTWARD WITH A POINT TO THE NORTH UNTIL THE 29 OF DECEM BER AT WHICH TIME IT WAS TO BE OPPOSITE TO THE SUN AND THAT THEN THE SAID TAYL WAS TO LOOK DIRECTLY NORTH BUT THAT AFTER THAT TIME THE TAYL WAS TO TURN EASTWARD AND CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL IT DISAPPEAR AND THAT IT SHALL DRAW A LITTLE TOWARDS THE NORTH UN TIL THE 8 OR 10 OF FEBRUARY AT WHICH TIME THE TAYL IS TO BE PA RALLEL TO THE AEQUATOR AS IF THE COMET BE YET SEEN FOR SOME TIME AFTER THE TAYL SHALL GO A LITTLE LOWER TOWARDS THE SOUTH BUT GROW SMALLER HE FINDS BY HIS HYPOTHESIS THAT ON THE 2 OF DECEMBER WHICH IS THE FIRSTOBSERVATION THAT HE HATH HEARD OF THIS STAR WAS TO BE ABOUT 7 TIMES MORE REMOTE FROM THE EARTH THAN WHEN IT WAS IN ITS PERIGEUM AND THAT IT WILL BE AGAIN IN AN EQUALL REMOTENESS FROM THE EARTH ON THE 27 OF JANUARY SO THAT HE IS OF OPINION THAT IN CASE THIS COMET HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN BEFORE THE 2 OF DECEM BER IT WILL NOT BE SEEN ANY MORE AFTER THE 27 OF JANUARY HE WISHES ABOVE ALL THINGS THAT IT MIGHT BE VERY EXACTLY OB SERVED AT WHAT ANGLE THE WAY OF THE COMET CUTS THE AEQUATOR AND MOST OF ALL THE ECLIPTICK THAT SO IT MAY BE SEEN WHETHER THERE7 THERE HATH NOT BEEN SOME PARALLAXE IN THE CIRCLE OF HIS MOTION AS ALSO THAT SOME OBSERVATIONS COULD BE HAD OF ITS GREATEST DE SCENT BENEATH THE TROPICK OF CAPRICORN IN THE MORE SOUTHERN PARTS WHERE HE SAITH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT REFRACTIONS MORE OVER OF THE TIME WHEN IT HATH BEEN IN QUADRAT WITH THE SUN A BOUT THE 20 OF DECEMBER AND THAT ALSO VERY EXACT OBSERVATION MIGHT BE MADE OF THE TIME OF ITS BEING AGAIN IN QUADRAT WITH THE SUN WHICH ACCORDING TO HIM WAS TO BE JANUARY 16 HE WISHES ALSO THAT SOME IN MADAGASCAR MAY HAVE OBSERVED THIS STAR SEEING THAT IT BEGAN TO APPEAR OVER THE MIDDLE OF THAT ISLAND AND PASSED TWICE OVER THEIR HEADS HE JUDGETH THAT THEY HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE US AND HE WISHETH LASTLY THAT THERE WERE SOME INTELLIGENT PERSON IN GUIANA TO OBSERVE IT THERE SEEING THAT WITHIN A FEW DAIES ACCORDING TO HIS RECKONING IT WILL PASS OVER THEIR HEADS AND WILL NOT REMOVE FROM THENCE BUT 8 OR 10 DE GREES NORTHWARD WHERE HE FAITH IT WILL DISAPPEAR THINKING IT IMPROBABLE THAT IT CAN STILL APPEAR AFTER THE SUN SHALL HAVE PAS SED IT THIS ACCOUNT BEARETH DATE OF THE 2 JANUARY NEW STILE 1665 AND THE AUTHOR THEREOF ADDETH THIS NOTE THAT SEEING IT COULD NOT BE PRINTED NOR DISTRIBUTED SO SOON AS HE DESIRED HE HATH HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VERIFIE IT BY SOME OBSERVATIONS FROM WHICH HE AFFIRMS HE HATH FOUND NO SENSIBLE DIFFERENCE OR IF THERE BE THAT IT PROCEEDS ONLY FROM THENCE THAT THE STARS HAVE ADVANCED SINCE HIS GLOBE WAS MADE HE CONCLUDETH THAT IF THIS CONTINUE AND THE FIRST OBSERVATIONS DO LIKEWISE AGREE OR THAT THE DIFFEREN CES DO ARRIVE WITHIN THE TIMES GHESSED BY HIM THAT HE HOPES HE SHALL DETERMINE BOTH THE DISTANCE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS COMET AND THAT PERHAPS ONE MAY BE ENABLED TO DECIDE THE QUESTION OF THE MOTION OF THE EARTH IN THE INTERIM HE ASSURETH THAT HE HATH NOT CHANGED THE LEAST NUMBER IN HIS CALCULATIONS AND THAT MUNSIEUR HUYGENS AND SEVERAL FRENCH GENTLEMEN TO WHOM HE SAITH HE HATH GIVEN THEM LONG SINCE CAN BEAR HIM WIT NESS THAT HE HATH DONE SO AS ALSO MANY OTHER FRIENDS OF HIS WHO SAW UPON HIS GLOBE SEVERAL DAIES BEFORE THE WAY OF THE CO MET FROM DAY TO DAY THUS FOR THE PARISIAN ACCOUNT OF THE COMET WHICH IS HERE IN SERTED AT LARGE THAT THE INTELLIGENT AND CURIOUS IN ENGLAND MAY COMPARE8 COMPARE THEIR OBSERVATIONS THEREWITH EITHER TO VERIFIE THESE PRAEDICTIONS OR TO FHEW WHEREIN THEY DIFFER WHICH IS AS WAS ALSO HINTED ABOVE THEE DESIGN OF THIS PHILOSOPHICAL PROPHET IN DISPERSING HIS CONCEPTIONS WHO DECLARETH HIMSELF READYIN CASE HE BE MIS TAKEN IN HIS RECKONING TO LEARN ANOTHER HYPOTHESIS TO EXPLICATE THESE ADMIRABLE APPEARANCES BY

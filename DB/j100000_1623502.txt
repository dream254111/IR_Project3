Constituci6n opposite the Portal de Mercaderes This was chiefly a visit  al arbol de la Noche Triste the famous tree against which Cortes rested and wept on the night of his terrible defeat The tree unfortu nately seems dying but its tremendous trunk a wooden tower may still be a land mark for centuries The tree of Montezuma at the back of Chapultepec is still flourishing one the grandest and most impressive of living things on this earth At ten oclock a visit was made to la Escuela Nacional de Ingenieros where is perhaps the greatest collection of large meteorites in the world At four oclock again in session in the Escuela Prepartoria But already we have followed long enough to give an insight into the life of this most enjoyable Congress and while the fortunate Americanistas go south by rail to Oaxaca thence to ride to Mitla digging in the pre historic past we face again the unsoftened raw newness of our own United States GEORGE BRUCE HALSTED AUSTIN TEXAS RECENT INVESTIGATIONS UPON THE EM BRYOLOGY AND PATIHOLOGY OF TEETH THE embryonic development of the teeth is now a subject of most active investiga tion and we are constantly receiving new communications from Leche in Stockholm Kiikenthal in Jena and Rose in Freiburg The most striking discovery is that of the existence throughout the mammalia of remnants of two series of teeth preceding the milk and permanent series The teeth represented in these two series are entirely vestigial both precede the embry onic development of the milk teeth and are indicated merely by indentations of the dental fold So far as known these germs never develop enamel but they constitute the most positive evidence of the deriva tion of the mammalia from reptilian or am phibian ancestors with a multiple dental succession These prelacteal teeth as they are called were first observed by Leche in 1892 in certain Insectivora but they have subsequently been found among the Marsupialia and in the seals R6se has now found unmistakable vestiges of these teeth in the human jaw Man therefore in com mon with many other mammals has four sets of teeth instead of two as formerly supposed R6ses investigations upon the teeth of Amphibia Reptilia and fishes demonstrate conclusively the truth of Hertwigs theory that teeth are modified scales which have passed into the mouth cavity He finds that the rudiments of the first series of teeth in each of these types develop exactly after the manner of the placoid dermal scale The second series of teeth develop after an intermediate type and it is only the third series of teeth which develop from the typical dental fold lying suspended within the mesoblast or lower tissue of that layer Dr R6se with Prof Kiikenthal of Jena has been the most active supporter of the theory of the origin of complex tooth crowns by concrescence of primitively sep arate cusps and this  concrescence theory  has spread very rapidly in Germany as an explanation of the mode of origin of the elaborate tooth forms There are very slight grounds of evidence for it among the mam malia in fishes however it has long appear ed probable that the wellknown type ofshark tooth Lantna consisting of three cusps united at the base so abundantly found in the phosphate beds of South Carolina rep resents a concrescence Rose has now made a very careful study of the tooth develop ment of Chlamydoselachus anguineus Garman and finds conclusive evidence that the com 686 SCIENCENOVEMBER 22 1895 pound crowns of this type are formed by the concrescence of three separate denticles Dr Carl Rose has also completed a most valuable investigation upon the causes of the decay of teeth  Ueber die Zahnverderb niss in den Volksschulen With the aid of two colleagues in the schools of Freiburg and the Black Forest he has examined 7364 children and 179087 teeth Special objects of the investigation were the relations of den tal caries to the geology of the country and the presence of a greater or less amount of lime salts in the water and secondly the influences of the consumption of different kinds of farinaceous food In general the use of water or food poor in lime salts af fects the development of the teeth very un favorably and the use especially of fine milled white bread is very prejudicial to sound teeth whereas the use of the com mon black bread keeps the teeth clean and the gums in a healthy condition As re gards stratigraphy the investigation shows that as we pass from granitic to overlying calcareous formations there is a steady de crease in the number of unsound teeth falling from 353 to 161 These figures are taken without regard to the character of the bread and other food consumed by the children and show exclusively the in fluence of water The conclusion is that the worst teeth of the calcareous districts are always better than the very best teeth found within the noncalcareous districts the degeneration of the teeth being indi cated by a yellowish white and bluish gray color In the matter of food meat is a great luxury among the peasant children enjoyed if at all only upon Sundays and can be left entirely out of account Dr Rose finds that the consumption of the German  Kuchen  made of white flour with milk butter or oil and more or less sugar raisins etc is very prejudicial to the teeth and in fact the very worst teeth are regularly found within those districts where these cakes are habitually consumed The conclu sion as to food is that the very best form of foods so far as teeth are concerned is the black bread with its coarse thick crust The investigation extends to the relation between the general condition of the mouth and gums and epidemics of diseases such as diphtheria which principally affect chil dren and Dr Rose maintains that there is a direct relation between the unhealthy condition of the teeth and gums and a pre disposition to epidemic diseases He be lieves that in times of epidemics these dis ease germs are found in the mouths of nearly all children and that a healthy con dition of the mouth resists the infectious power of the germ As regards sex there is very little difference between the boys and girls in the matter of decay It is an interesting point that the development of the teeth is very much more rapid in girls than in boys so that in children of the same age a much larger proportion of milk teeth are found among boys than among girls The article closes with a strong appeal for the education of children in the schools in the proper care and protection of the teeth and the author recommends not only the careful instruction of children in this respect but also the award of prizes H F O CURRENT NOTES ON PHYSIOGRAPHY THE MARGINAL PLAIN OF CHINA SKERTCHLY AND KINGSMILL describe

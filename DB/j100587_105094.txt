ROD OF THE PENDULUM MAY BE PREVENTED BY JOHN ELLICOTT F R S THE FIRST OF THESE METHODS CONSISTS IN A PARTICULAR CONSTRUCTION OF THE PEN DULUM ITSELF WHICH OCCURRD TO ME SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1738 I PUT INTO THE HANDS OF MR MACHIN THEN ONE OF THE SECRETARIES A DESCRIPTION AND A DRAWING OF SUCH A PENDULUM IN ORDER TO THEIR BEING LAID BEFORE THIS HONOURABLE SOCIETY BUT MR MACHIN SOON AFTER ACQUAINTING ME THAT A GENTLEMAN OF WHOSE SKILL AND JUDGMENT IN MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCES I HAD ALWAYS ENTERTAIND THE HIGHEST OPINION MADE SOME OBJECTIONS I WAS ADVISED TO DEFER COMMUNICATING MY INVENTION TO THIS SOCIETY TILL I SHOULD HAVE EXAMINED INTO THE WEIGHT OF THOSE OBJECTIONS AND BY A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL SHOULD BE FULLY ASSURED THAT THE CONTRIVANCE WOULD ANSWER THE END PROPOSED AND HAVING NOW AT LENGTH OBTAIND THAT SATISFACTION I BEG LEAVE TO GIVE A SHORT NARRATIVE OF SOME OF THE MOST REMARKA BLE OBSERVATIONS I HAVE MADE DURING THIS INQUIRY WHICH I HOPE WILL NOT PROVE UNACCEPTABLE TO THIS HONOURABLE SOCIETY READ JUNE 4 1752 ABOUT THE YEAR 1732 AN EXPERIMENT WHICH I MADE IN ORDER TO SATISFY SOME GENTLEMEN THAT THE ROD OF A PENDULUM WAS LIABLE TO BE CONSIDERABLY IN FLUENCED BY MODERATE DEGREES OF HEAT AND COLD LED ME480 ME TO CONSIDER THAT AS METALS DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER IN THEIR DENSITY IT WAS HIGHLY PROBABLE THEY MIGHT LIKEWISE DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER IN THEIR EX PANSION AND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE OF THE EXPANSIONS OF TWO METALS MIGHT BE SO APPLIED AS IN A GREAT MEA SURE TO REMOVE THOSE IRREGULARITIES IN THE MOTION OF A CLOCK WHICH ARISE FROM THE EFFECT OF HEAT AND COID UPON THE LENGTH OF A PENDULUM WITH THIS VIEW NOT LONG AFTERWARDS I CONTRIVED THE PENDULUM NOW DESCRIBED BY FIG 1 IN WHICH A B REPRESENTS A BAR OF BRASS MADE QUITE FAST AT THE UPPER PART BY PINS AND HELD CONTIGUOUS AT SEVERAL EQUAL DISTANCES BY THE SCREWS 1 2 3 C TO THE ROD OF THE PENDULUM WHICH IS A BAR OF IRON AND SO FAR AS THE BRASS BAR REACHES IS FILED OF THE SAME SIZE AND SHAPE AND CONSEQUENTLY DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE FIGURE BUT A LITTLE BELOW THE END OF THE BRASS BAR THE IRON IS LEFT BROADER AS AT D D FOR THE CON VENIENCY OF FIXING THE WORK TO IT AND IS MADE OF A SUFFICIENT LENGTH TO PASS QUITE THRO THE BALL OF THE PENDULUM TO C THE HOLES 1 2 C IN THE BRASS THRO WHICH THE SHANKS OF THE SCREWS PASS INTO THE IRON ROD OF THE PENDULUM ARE FILED AS IN THE

AGAINST THE END OF THE BRASS BAR AT 6 THINGS BEING IN THIS SITUATION LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE ROD OF THE PENDULUM AND THE BRASS ANNEXED TO IT GROW LONGER BY HEAT AND THAT THE BRASS LENGTHENS MORE THAN THE IRON OF THE SAME LENGTH THEN THE BRASS BY ITS EXCESS OF DILATATION WILL PRESS THE SHORT ENDS OF THE LEVERS DOWNWARDS AT 6 AND AT THE SAME TIME NECES SARILY LIFT UP THE BALL WHICH RESTS UPON THE LONG ENDS OF THE SAME LEVERS AT F F TO ANY PROPORTION NECESSARY AND PROVIDED THE ENDS OF THE SCREWS DO PRESS UPON THE LEVERS AT A PROPER DISTANCE FROM THE CENTRES THE SAID BALL WILL BE ALWAYS KEPT AT THE POINT OF SUSPEN SION NOTWITHSTANDING ANY ALTERATION THE ROD OF THE PENDULUM MAY BE LIABLE TO FROM HEAT OR COLD WHAT THIS DISTANCE OUGHT TO BE MAY VERY NEARLY BE DETER MINED IF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE EXPANSION BETWEEN THE BRASS AND IRON BARS IS KNOWN FOR THE PROPORTION THE SHORTER ARMS OF THE LEVERS OUGHT TO BEAR TO THE LONGER ONES WILL ALWAYS BE AS THE EXCESS OF THE EX PANSION OF THE BRASS IS

BE VERY LIABLE TO DO THE DESCRIPTION HERE GIVEN IS EXACTLY AGREEABLE TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRIVANCE AND THE ONLY ALTERATION I HAVE SINCE MADE IN IT CONSISTS IN PLACING THE SCREWS G G WITHIN THE BALL OF THE PENDULUM AS REPRESENTED IN FIG 4 BUT AS THE SUCCESS OF THIS CONTRIVANCE DEPENDED INTIRELY UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT METALS WERE EX PANDED DIFFERENTLY BY THE SAME DEGREE OF HEAT BE FORE I ATTEMPTED TO PUT IT IN EXECUTION I THOUGHT PROPER TO INQUIRE WHAT EXPERIMENTS HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE UPON THIS SUBJECT WHEN MR JOHN EAMES A LATE VERY WORTHY MEMBER OF THIS SOCIETY PUT INTO MY HANDS MR GRAHAMS ACCOUNT OF HIS QUICKSILVER PENDULUM483 PENDULUM AS IT IS NOW COMMONLY CALLED PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS NO 392 WHICH ACCOUNT I FOUND TO BE INTRODUCED BY THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH  WHEREAS SEVERAL WHO HAVE BEEN CURIOUS IN  MEASURING OF TIME HAVE TAKEN NOTICE THAT THE VI  BRATIONS OF A PENDULUM ARE SLOWER IN SUMMER THAN  IN WINTER AND HAVE VERY JUSTLY SUPPOSED THIS AL  TERATION HAS PROCEEDED FROM A CHANGE OF LENGTH IN  THE PENDULUM ITSELF BY THE INFLUENCES OF HEAT AND  COLD UPON IT IN THE DIFFERENT SEASONS OF THE YEAR  WITH A VIEW THEREFORE OF CORRECTING IN SOME DE  GREE THIS DEFECT OF THE PENDULUM I MADE SEVE  RAL TRIALS ABOUT THE YEAR 1715 TO DISCOVER WHE  THER THERE WAS ANY CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE OF EX  PANSION BETWEEN BRASS STEEL IRON COPPER SILVER  C WHEN EXPOSED TO THE SAME DEGREES OF HEAT  AS NEARLY AS I COULD DETERMINE CONCEIVING IT WOULD  NOT BE VERY DIFFICULT BY MAKING USE OF TWO SORTS  OF METALS DIFFERING CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR DEGREES OF  EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION TO REMEDY IN GREAT  MEASURE THE IRREGULARITIES TO WHICH COMMON PEN  DULUMS ARE SUBJECT BUT ALTHOUGH IT IS EASILY DIS  COVERABLE THAT ALL THESE METALS SUFFER A SENSIBLE  ALTERATION OF THEIR DIMENSION BY HEAT AND COLD  YET I FOUND THEIR DIFFERENCES IN QUANTITY FROM ONE  ANOTHER WERE SO SMALL AS GAVE ME NO HOPES OF  SUCCEEDING THIS WAY AND MADE ME LEAVE OFF PRO  SECUTING THIS AFFAIR ANY FARTHER AT THAT TIME THE READING THIS PARAGRAPH PROVED AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENT TO MAKE ME LAY ASIDE ALL THOUGHTS OF SUC CEEDING IN A CONTRIVANCE FOUNDED UPON PRINCIPLES WHICH A GENTLEMAN OF SO GREAT ABILITIES AND KNOWN P P P 2 ACCURACY484 ACCURACY IN MAKING EXPERIMENTS HAD AFTER TRIAL JUDGED TO BE INSUFFICIENT AND IT WAS NOT TILL ABOUT THE LATTER END OF THE YEAR 1734 THAT I AGAIN RESUMED THEM ON THE FOLLOWING OCCASION A GENTLEMAN DE SIROUS TO MAKE SOME EXPERIMENTS CONCERNING THE EX PANSIONOF METALS EMPLOYD ME TO MAKE HIM AN IN STRUMENT LIKE ONE INVENTED BY MR MUSCHENBROEK FOR THAT PURPOSE WHICH HE CALLS A PYROMETER UPON LOOKING OVER MR MUSCHENBROEKS EXPERIMENTS I NOT ONLY FOUND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXPANSION OF SOME OF THE METALS MUCH GREATER THAN I EXPECTED BUT AS I THOUGHT IF THEY WERE TO BE DEPENDED UPON SUFFICIENT TO ANSWER MY FORMER PURPOSE THIS LED ME TO CONSIDER THE STRUCTURE OF THE INSTRUMENT WHICH MR MUSCHENBROEK MADE USE OF IN HIS TRIALS AND UPON EXAMINATION I THOUGHT IT LIABLE TO SOME OBJEC TIONS WHICH I IMAGINED WOULD MAKE THE RESULT OF EXPERIMENTS MADE BY HIS INSTRUMENT VERY UNCERTAIN I THEREFORE ENDEAVOURD TO CONTRIVE ONE OF A DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION THAT MIGHT BE MORE TO BE DEPENDED UPON SUCH AN INSTRUMENT I SOME TIME AFTERWARDS COMPLETED AND HAD THE PLEASURE TO FIND IT SO FAR MET WITH THE APPROBATION OF SEVERAL VERY WORTHY MEMBERS OF THIS SOCIETY THAT AT THEIR PARTICULAR DE SIRE I DREW UP A DESCRIPTION OF IT WHICH WAS READ AND THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF SHEWN TO THE SOCIETY ON THE 8 OF APRIL 1736  AND THOUGH IT WAS NOT IN EVERY RE SPECT  THIS APPEARS FROM THE MINUTES OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY THO THE DESCRIPTION AND MANNER OF THAT INSTRUMENT WAS BY SOME MISTAKE PLACED SIX MONTHS LATER IN THE PHILOS TRANS VOL XXXIX N 443 FOR OCTOBER 1736 THE OTHER DATES MENTIOND IN THIS PAPER RE LATING TO THAT INSTRUMENT ARE LIKEWISE JUSTIFIED BY AUTHENTIC VOUCH ERS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY MR ELLICOTT485 SPECT SO ACCURATE AS I COULD WISH I AM FULLY PER SUADED THAT SUCH EXPERIMENTS AS ARE CAREFULLY MADE WITH IT MAY BE DEPENDED UPON AS VERY NEAR THE TRUTH HAVING MADE A GREAT VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTS WITH THIS INSTRUMENT UPON BARS OF DIFFERENT METALS AS NEARLY OF THE SAME DIMENSIONS AS POSSIBLE I FOUND UPON A MEDIUM THEIR SEVERAL EXPANSIONS BY THE SAME DEGREE OF HEAT TO BE AS FOLLOWS GOLD SILVER BRASS COPPER IRON STEEL LEAD 73 103 95 89 60 56 149 AND AS I FOUND SO GREAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EX PANSION OF BRASS AND IRON I IMMEDIATELY DETERMINED TO MAKE A PENDULUM AFTER THE MANNER ABOVE DE SCRIBED COMPOSED OF THOSE TWO METALS AND LIKEWISE ORDERD A CLOCK TO BE MADE WITH THE UTMOST CARE AND EXACTNESS AND AS I THEN APPREHENDED WITH SOME CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENTS WITH WHICH I IN TENDED TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENTS THESE WERE BOTH FINISHED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1738 AND HAV ING NO REASON TO DOUBT OF SUCCESS I SHEWD THE PEN DULUM TO THE LATE MR MACHIN AND GAVE HIM A DRAW ING AND DESCRIPTION OF IT IN ORDER TO ITS BEING COM MUNICATED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY BUT AS I HAVE AL READY OBSERVED OBJECTIONS WERE MADE TO IT OF WHICH THE ONLY ONE THAT APPEARED TO HAVE ANY WEIGHT WAS THAT IT HAD BEEN FOUND BY EXPERIMENT THAT TWO BARS OF DIFFERENT METALS SCREWD TOGETHER SO AS TO BE IN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER WOULD NOT EXPAND REGULARLY AND SMOOTHLY BUT BY JERKS IN ORDER TO EXAMINE INTO THE FORCE OF THIS OBJECTION I DIRECTED TWO BARS OF EQUAL DIMENSIONS TO BE MADE ONE OF BRASS THE OTHER OF IRON OF ABOUT TWO FEET IN LENGTH FASTEND TOGETHER AFTER THE SAME MANNER AS THE TWO RODS OF THE PENDULUM486 PENDULUM WHICH I INTENDED TO PLACE SO THAT BY ACTING VERY NEAR THE CENTRE OF AN INDEX OF A CONSIDER ABLE LENGTH EVEN THE SMALLEST ALTERATION IN THE BARS WOULD BE MADE SENSIBLE AND BY THE MOTION OF THE INDEX I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FORM A JUDGMENT WHETHER THE RODS MOVED REGULARLY AND FREELY OR NOT BUT BE FORE THIS WAS PUT INTO EXECUTION I CONTRIVED BY FASTENING THE TWO BARS TO THE BACK PLATE OF A CLOCK NOT ONLY TO MAKE THEM ANSWER THE END ABOVE PRO POSD BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO LENGTHEN OR SHORTEN A PENDULUM OF A COMMON CONSTRUCTION IN SUCH A MANNER AS SUFFICIENTLY TO CORRECT THE IRREGULARITIES ARISING FROM THE INFLUENCE OF COLD OR HEAT UPON IT THE MANNER OF APPLYING THEM IS DESCRIBED BY FIG 3 IN WHICH A A A A REPRESENTS THE BACK PLATE OF THE CLOCK B B B A TRIANGULAR PIECE OF BRASS SCREWD BY TWO SCREWS THRO THE SLITS C C TO THE PLATE YET SO THAT IT MAY BE DRAWN BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS BY MEANS OF THE SCREW AT D E F IS A BRASS BAR ABOUT TWO FEET IN LENGTH MADE FAST AT THE BOTTOM BY A SCREW AND TWO PINS AT F TO AN IRON ONE OF EQUAL DI MENSIONS TO WHICH IT IS LIKEWISE SCREWD BY THE SCREWS 1 2 3 C AFTER THE SAME MANNER AS THE ROD OF THE PENDULUM ALREADY DESCRIBED THE IRON BAR IS FASTENED AT THE UPPER END TO THE TRIANGULAR PIECE OF BRASS NEARLY UNDER THAT PART OF THE BRASS BAR MARKED E G H IS A STRONG BRASS OR IRON LEVER MOVE ABLE UPON A CENTRE AT G AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE UP PER END OF THE BRASS BAR I I IS THE COCK ON WHICH IN A COMMON CLOCK THE PENDULUM IS HUNG K K PART OF THE ROD OF THE PENDULUM WHOSE SPRING PASS ING THRO A FINE SLIT IN THE COCK I I IS FASTEND TO A STUD RIVETED INTO THE LEVER AT L THE SLIT IN THE COCK MUST487 MUST BE MADE SO CLOSE AS TO PREVENT THE SPRING FROM HAVING ANY LATERAL MOTION IN IT FROM THIS DESCRIPTION IT IS EVIDENT THAT IF THE BRASS BAR EXPANDS MORE THAN THE IRON ONE IT WILL RAISE UP THE LEVER AND CONSEQUENTLY THE PENDULUM WHICH IS FASTEND TO IT AND AS THE LENGTH OF THE PEN DULUM IS ONLY FROM THE CENTRE OF OSCILLATION TO THE UNDER PART OF THE SLIT THRO WHICH THE SPRING PASSES THE PENDULUM WILL BE THEREBY SHORTENED AND BY MAKING THE POINT OF THE BRASS BAR TO ACT UPON A PRO PER PART OF THE LEVER TO WHICH IT IS CAPABLE OF BEING ADJUSTED BY MEANS OF THE SCREW D THE PENDULUM MAY BE SHORTENED TO WHATEVER DEGREE SHALL BE NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE PENDULUM FROM BENDING THE BARS WHICH IT WOULD BE LIABLE TO DO IF THE BALL OF THE PEN DULUM WAS OF ANY CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT THE END OF THE LEVER FARTHEST FROM ITS CENTRE OF MOTION IS HOOKD TO THE END OF A CHAIN WHICH IS WOUND ABOUT AND FASTENED TO A SMALL PULLEY AT M UPON THE SAME ARBOR TO WHICH THIS PULLEY IS FIXED IS FASTENED AN OTHER PULLEY OF A MUCH LARGER DIAMETER TO WHICH IS HUNG BY A SILK LINE THE WEIGHT OR COUNTERPOISE N BY MEANS OF THIS COUNTERPOISE ANY PART OF THE WEIGHT OF THE PENDULUM THAT SHALL BE DESIRED MAY BE TAKEN OFF FROM PRESSING AGAINST THE BRASS BAR AND IF UPON THE END OF THE ARBOR TO WHICH THE PULLIES ARE FIXED AN INDEX BE PLACED SO AS TO POINT TO A GRADUATED CIR CLE THE LEAST MOTION OF THE LEVER WILL NOT ONLY BE EASILY PERCEIVED BUT ALSO WHETHER THAT MOTION IS UNI FORM AND REGULAR OR NOT AND UPON HAVING SOME TIME AFTER MADE A CLOCK WITH THIS CONTRIVANCE ADDED TO IT I HAD THE PLEASURE TO FIND THE INDEX NOT ONLY TO MOVE VERY SENSIBLY BUT VERY REGULARLY AND NEVER THAT488 THAT I COULD PERCEIVE BY JERKS AND I DOUBT NOT BUT WHEN THE POINT OF BEARING OF THE BRASS BAR UPON THE LEVER IS ONCE WELL ADJUSTED IT WILL BE FOUND TO LENGTHEN OR SHORTEN THE PENDULUM TO AS GREAT A DEGREE OF EXACTNESS AS ANY OTHER METHOD WHATSOEVER BUT AS I HAVE NOT AS YET THOUGHT OF ANY OTHER METHOD OF ADJUSTING IT EXCEPT FROM ACTUAL TRIAL IN DIFFERENT SEA SONS OF THE YEAR I MUST PREFER THE PENDULUM TO THIS METHOD WHICH FROM THE GREAT EASE AS WELL AS EX ACTNESS WITH WHICH IT IS CAPABLE OF BEING ADJUSTED WILL I THINK APPEAR TO HAVE MUCH THE ADVANTAGE OVER ANY OTHER CONTRIVANCE YET MADE USE OF FOR THIS PURPOSE THE METHOD I TAKE FOR ADJUSTING THE LONGER ARMS OF THE LEVERS OF THE PENDULUM TO THE SHORTER ONES IS DESCRIBED IN FIG 4 TO A STRONG POST FIXED TO THE WALL IS FASTENED A SMALL SHELF SUPPORTED BY TWO BRACKETS A B IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS SHELF IS FASTENED A WIRE BY THE SCREW  TO THE END OF WHICH THE PEN DULUM IS TO BE HUNG BELOW THIS SHELF AT THE DI STANCE OF ABOUT 40 INCHES IS PLACED THE INDEX C D TURNING FREELY UPON A CENTER THE LENGTH OF THE IN DEX IS 50 INCHES AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF AN INCH UPON A PART OF THE INDEX PRODUCED BEYOND THE CENTRE IS PLACED A STEEL PIN AND IN THE BACK OF THE PENDU LUM AS NEAR THE CENTRE OF OSCILLATION AS MAY BE IS DRILLED AN HOLE TO RECEIVE THIS PIN WHEN THE PEN DULUM IS HUNG UPON THE WIRE AGAINST THE POST AND THE WIRE IS SCREWD HIGHER OR LOWER BY THE SCREW E TILL THE PIN RESTING AGAINST THE UPPER PART OF THE HOLE WHICH IS FILED INTO A PROPER SHAPE FOR THAT PURPOSE KEEPS THE INDEX NEARLY IN AN HORIZONTAL POSITION BE LOW THE BOTTOM OF THE PENDULUM IS PLACED A SECOND INDEX 1489 INDEX F G EXACTLY LIKE THE FORMER EXCEPT THAT IT IS KEPT IN AN HORIZONTAL POSITION BY THE SCREW K BEARING AGAINST THE END OF THE IRON ROD WHEN THE EXPERIMENT IS TO BE MADE THE PENDULUM IS FIRST PUT INTO A BOX AND GRADUALLY HEATED BY A LARGE FIRE TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE BEING OFTEN TURNED THAT EVERY PART MAY BE EQUALLY EXPOSED TO THE FIRE AND HAVING CONTINUED SHUT UP IN THE BOX FOR SOME TIME AFTER IT IS REMOVED FROM THE FIRE THAT THE TWO RODS MAY BE HEATED AS UNIFORMLY TO THE SAME DEGREE AS POSSIBLE THE PENDU LUM IS HUNG UPON THE WIRE AND THE TWO INFERREDINDEXESINFERRED MADE TO STAND NEARLY IN AN HORIZONTAL POSITION THE TWO GRADUATED PLATES H I ARE THEN SLID UPON A WIRE TILL THE DIVISIONS IN EACH MARKD O ARE POINTED TO BY THE INDEXES AS THE PENDULUM COOLS THE LOWER IN DEX WILL BE SEEN GRADUALLY TO DESCEND BUT IF THE ENDS OF THE TWO SCREWS IN THE BALL OF THE PENDULUM ACT UPON PROPER PARTS OF THE LEVERS THE UPPER INDEX WILL CONTINUE IN THE SAME PLACE IF THE ENDS OF THE SCREWS ARE EITHER TOO FAR OFF OR TOO NEAR THE CENTRES OF THE LEVERS THE INDEX WILL EITHER RISE OR DESCEND AND BY COMPARING THE NUMBER OF DIVISIONS IT HAS VARIED WITH THOSE WHICH THE LOWER INDEX HAS VARIED A NEAR ESTI MATE MAY BE MADE HOW MUCH THE SCREWS REQUIRE TO BE ALTERD AND IN A VERY FEW TRIALS THEY MAY EASILY BE ADJUSTED TO A VERY GREAT EXACTNESS IN ORDER TO MAKE AN ACTUAL TRIAL HOW FAR THIS CONTRI VANCE OF THE PENDULUM WILL ANSWER THE END PROPOSED IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE CLOCK TO WHICH THE PENDULUM IS FITTED BE MADE WITH GREAT EXACTNESS AND INTIRELY TO BE DEPENDED ON FOR OTHERWISE THE EXPERIMENTS WILL BE VERY UNCERTAIN AS I FOUND IN THE CLOCK I FIRST MADE USE OF Q Q Q I HAVE490 I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THAT IN ORDER TO RENDER THIS CLOCK AS PERFECT AS POSSIBLE I MADE IT IN SEVE RAL RESPECTS DIFFERENT FROM THE COMMON ONES IN HOPES OF REMOVING SOME IMPERFECTIONS I APPREHENDED THEY WERE LIABLE TO BUT AS IN THIS ATTEMPT I FELL INTO AN ERROR WHICH IT WAS A CONSIDERABLE TIME BEFORE I DIS COVERD MY MAKING THE TRIAL WAS THEREBY GREATLY RE TARDED AND IN ORDER TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM FALLING INTO THE LIKE MISTAKE I SHALL BEG LEAVE TO GIVE SOME SHORT ACCOUNT OF IT IN A COMMON CLOCK THE PENDULUM IS USUALLY HUNG BY A SPRING TO A COCK ON THE BACK PLATE OF THE CLOCK WHILST THE WHEEL AND PALLETS BY WHICH THE PENDU LUM IS KEPT IN MOTION ARE PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRAME AND THE PENDULUM IS MOVED BY A PIECE OF STEEL CALLD THE CRUTCH RIVETED TO ONE END OF THE ARBOR TO WHICH THE PALLETS ARE FASTENED THIS DISPOSITION OF THE PIECES I APPREHENDED LIABLE TO SOME CONSIDERABLE OBJECTIONS TO REMEDY WHICH I CONTRIVED TO FIX THE PALLETS TO THE UPPER PART OF THE PENDULUM ITSELF ABOVE THE CENTRE OF MOTION AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THE PENDULUM VIBRATE AS FREELY AS POSSIBLE IT WAS MADE TO TURN UPON TWO STEEL POINTS AND WAS HUNG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRAME EXACTLY UNDER THE SWINGWHEEL AND SO AS TO VIBRATE IN THE SAME PLANE WITH IT BY THIS MEANS I WAS IN HOPES THAT IT WOULD HAVE MOVED WITH MUCH GREATER FREEDOM AND REGULARITY THAN WHEN HUNG AFTER THE COMMON METHOD AND UPON TRIAL IT WAS FOUND TO MOVE WITH SO GREAT FREEDOM THAT A PENDULUM OF ABOVE 20 POUNDS WEIGHT WHEN HUNG IN ITS PLACE WITHOUT THE CLOCKWORK AND MADE TO VIBRATE THRO AN ARCH OF TWO DEGREES WAS FOUND TO MAKE ABOVE 1200491 1200 VIBRATIONS BEFORE IT HAD LOST HALF A DEGREE AND WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE A SENSIBLE MOTION ABOVE 20 HOURS AFTERWARDS AND THE CLOCK WHEN FIRST PUT TO GETHER WAS KEPT GOING FOR SEVERAL DAYS BY A WEIGHT OF ONLY ELEVEN OUNCES HUNG TO THE END OF A SINGLE LINE BUT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE I DISCOVERD THAT THIS GREAT FREEDOM MADE IT LIABLE TO BE CONSIDERABLY AFFECTED BY THE LEAST MOTION A REMARBABLE INSTANCE OF THIS I COMMUNICATED TO THIS SOCIETY WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHI CAL TRANSACTIONS NO 453 BUT THE GREATEST OBJEC TION TO THIS METHOD WAS THE POINTS BEING SUBJECT TO WEAR AND I FOUND THAT THE LEAST ALTERATION IN THEM WOULD OCCASION THE CLOCK TO VARY MUCH MORE THAN WITHOUT HAVING MADE THE TRIAL I COULD HAVE IMA GINED TO REMEDY THIS INCONVENIENCE I MADE THE PENDULUM TO MOVE UPON EDGES LIKE THOSE ON WHICH THE BEAM OF A PAIR OF SCALES TURNS A METHOD I HAD GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE HAD BEEN MADE USE OF WITH SUCCESS BUT I FOUND THESE LIKEWISE LIABLE TO WEAR THO NOT IN SO SHORT A TIME AS THE POINTS SO THAT AFTER MUCH TIME SPENT IN MAKING SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS IN ORDER TO REMEDY THIS INCONVENIENCE I FOUND MYSELF OBLIGED TO LAY THIS METHOD WHOLLY ASIDE AND TO HANG THE PENDULUM UPON A SPRING AS USUAL IN MAKING THIS ALTERATION I OBSERVED ONE CIRCUM STANCE WHICH I THINK DESERVES TO BE TAKEN NOTICE OF BEFORE I MADE ANY ALTERATION IN THE WORK I TOOK PAR TICULAR NOTICE TO WHAT HEIGHT THE PENDULUM REQUIRED TO BE RAISED BEFORE THE PALLETS WOULD ESCAPE FROM THE WHEEL I NEXT OBSERVED THE NUMBER OF DEGREES OF EACH VIBRATION OF THE PENDULUM WHEN MOVD BY THE CLOCKWORK AND THEN THE CLOCKWORK BEING REMOVD Q Q Q 2 THE492 THE PENDULUM WAS MADE TO DESCRIBE AN ARCH OF TWO DEGREES AND PARTICULAR NOTICE WAS LIKEWISE TAKEN IN WHAT SPACE OF TIME IT HAD LOST HALF A DEGREE EACH VI BRATION HAVING THEN MADE THE NECESSARY ALTERATIONS FOR HANGING THE PENDULUM BY A SPRING AND PARTICULAR CARE BEING TAKEN THAT THE PALLETS SHOULD SCAPE OFF FROM THE WHEEL EXACTLY AT THE SAME ANGLE AS BEFORE THE PENDULUM BEING HUNG BY ITS SPRING AND MADE TO VIBRATE THRO AN ARCH OF TWO DEGREES IT WAS OB SERVED TO LOSE HALF A DEGREE IN ABOUT HALF THE TIME IT DID WHEN TURNING UPON EDGES BUT UPON BEING SET AGOING BY THE CLOCKWORK THE PENDULUM WAS FOUND TO DESCRIBE AN ARCH OF NEAR TWO DEGREES MORE THAN BEFORE FOR WHEN IT TURNED UPON THE EDGES IT DESCRIBED AN ARCH OF ONLY THREE DEGREES WHEREAS NOW IT WAS HUNG BY THE SPRING IT VIBRATED NEAR FIVE DEGREES WHICH WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I EX PECTED THIS ALTERATION BEING MADE I SOON FOUND THAT THE CLOCK WENT VERY REGULAR AND AFTER A SUFFICIENT TRIAL WAS FULLY SATISFIED THE PENDULUM WOULD ANSWER MY EXPECTATIONS BUT FEARING LEFT I MIGHT BE THOUGHT PREJUDICED IN FAVOUR OF MY OWN INVENTION I ENGAGED THE REV MR PROFESSOR BLISS TO MAKE TRIAL OF IT AND ACCORDINGLY IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1750 I SENT TO HIM AT OXFORD A CLOCK FOR THAT PURPOSE AND IN JANUARY LAST I RECEIVED FROM HIM A LETTER GIVING HIS OPINION OF IT OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING SO FAR AS RELATES TO THE CLOCK IS AN EXACT COPY  S I R  I HAVE NOW HAD THOROUGH TRIAL OF THE CLOCK  AND AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED THAT YOUR PENDULUM  TAKES493  TAKES OFF THE EFFECT OF HEAT AND COLD AS WELL AS  EITHER THE GRIDIRON  PENDULUM AS IT IS COM  MONLY CALLED OR THE QUICKSILVER PENDULUM AND  THIS UPON SUFFICIENT TRIAL FOR NEAR TWO YEARS IT HAS  THIS ADVANTAGE OF BOTH THE FOREMENTIOND ONES  THAT IT MAY BY LENGTHENING OR SHORTENING THE  LEVERS BE EASILY ADJUSTED TO THE EXACT PROPORTION  OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE IRON AND BRASS WHICH NEI  THER OF THOSE KINDS IS CAPABLE OF WITHOUT VERY  GREAT TROUBLE AND DIFFICULTY I WAS INDEED PREJU  DICED AGAINST THE METHOD OF DOING IT BY LEVERS AS  I HAD HEARD THE LATE MR GRAHAM SAY THAT HE HAD  TRIED LEVERS IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAT HE FOUND THEY  DID NOT WORK REGULARLY AND FREELY BUT BY JERKS  HOWEVER IN YOUR METHOD I AM SATISFIED BY THE  FULLEST EXPERIENCE THAT THEY SUCCEED AS WELL AS  EITHER OF THE OTHER SORTS OR PERHAPS ANY OTHER KIND  THAT MAY BE INVENTED HEREAFTER BEFORE I CONCLUDE THIS PAPER I SHALL BEG LEAVE TO ACQUAINT THIS HONOURABLE SOCIETY THAT IN THE YEAR 1748 I MADE A MODEL OF A CONTRIVANCE TO BE ADDED TO A POCKETWATCH FOUNDED UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES AND INTENDED TO ANSWER THE LIKE PUR POSE AS THE PENDULUM ABOVE DESCRIBED AND AT A MEETING OF A COUNCIL OF THIS SOCIETY ON FEBRUARY 15 LAST I PRODUCED A WATCH WHICH I HAD MADE FOR A GENTLEMAN WITH THIS CONTRIVANCE ADDED TO IT AND LIKEWISE THE MODEL BY WHICH WAS SHEWN TO THE GENTLEMEN THEN PRESENT WHAT EFFECT A SMALL DEGREE OF HEAT WOULD HAVE UPON IT BUT AS I HAVE NOT YET HAD SUFFICIENT TRIAL OF THIS WATCH I SHALL DEFER GIVING A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF THIS CONTRIVANCE TILL I AM FULLY494 FULLY SATISFIED TO WHAT DEGREE OF EXACTNESS IT CAN BE MADE TO ANSWER THE END PROPOSED I AM JUNE 4 1752 GENTLEMEN YOUR MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT J ELLICOTT LXXXII

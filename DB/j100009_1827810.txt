j100009,The American Economic Review,1827810,The Farmers Income,i331814,THE FARMERS INCOME The object of this paper is to estimate the average amount of income received by farm families in the United States during the census year 1909 A bulletin on the farmers income by W J Spillman based on preliminary census figures was issued by the Department of Agriculture on July 19 1913 since that time more detailed statistics have become available and investigations by the Department of Agriculture have supplied a basis for estimating certain items omitted by the census The following table presents a summary statement of the farm ers business for the year 1909 Income and Expenditures of Average Farmer 1909 Items Total Per farm I X LOME Value of crops  3250359348 511    livestock products2

wool and mohair 3Exclusive of value of unpaid family labor The first item in the table is the value of crops exclusive of crops fed to the livestock on home farms The value of crops fed1916 The Farmers Income 43 was ascertained in the following manner The total value of feedable crops that is corn oats barley hay and forage kafir corn emmer and spelt was 2786000000 of this amount 509 000000 represented the value of the feed sold by the farmers and 40000000 was the estimated value of the corn consumed by the farm families in the Cotton Belt at the rate of 20 per farm leaving 2236000000 as the value of the crops fed to the live stock on home farms By subtracting this figure from the 5487 000000 which represents the total value of all crops we obtain the value of crops not fed to the livestock on the home farm as given in the table To the net value of crops is added the value of livestock pro ducts and of animals sold and animals slaughtered on farms ag gregating 2958000000 In addition to this the farmer had the use of his house and some fuel and food supplied by the farm and not enumerated by the Census Office An estimate of these items has been obtained on the basis of Farmers Bulletin No 635 by W C Funk of the Office of Farm Management entitled What the Farm Contributes Directly to the Farmers Living Mr Funks investigation included 483 farm families scattered widely over the United States and his conclusion was that the average farm family receives about 125 as rental value of the farm house about 35 as the value of fuel and about 47 as the value of milk and cream consumed on the farm In connection with the item for rent it should be kept in mind that the farmer has been charged with 5 per cent interest and with maintenance on his entire property including his house so that it is necessary to credit him with the rental value of his house in order to offset these items of expenditure It may be that Mr Funks average of 125 is too high for the United States as a whole if that be so the income of the farmer as given in the table is above the true income by that excess According to Mr Funks figures 207 should be added to the average income of the farm family on account of rent fuel and milk and cream consumed none of which is in cluded in the census returns Furthermore the poultry and eggs the pork and beef and the vegetables and fruits consumed by the farm family are not completely covered by the census enumerator No satisfactory way of estimating the value of these omitted items is available but Mr Funks bulletin places the total value of the food supplied by the home farm at 261 of which about 150 was represented by pork and beef poultry and eggs apples and44 E A Goldenweiser March peaches and Irish and sweet potatoes It seems certain that the 47 for milk and cream can safely be raised to 100 to cover all these additional items and the total for house rent fuel and food not included in census returns but supplied by the farm thus becomes 260 When to this figure is added 161 as the value of food supplied by the farm and presumably counted by the census enumerators the total value of what the farm contributes directly to the farmers living appears to be 421 The total earnings of farms and farm families arrived at in this way were thus about 7862000000 or 1236 per farm The farm expenses were obtained through a combination of census fig ures and estimates based on agricultural surveys The amounts expended on hired labor 651000000 on fertilizers 115000 000 on feed 300000000 and on animals purchased 840 000000 were given by the Census Bureau In addition to this estimates were made of the amount expended for seed and for threshing charges The estinmates of the expenditures for seed were based on the acreage of each of the principal crops the average number of bushels used for seed per acre in the different regions of the United States obtained by correspondence with agents of the Department of Agriculture and the average value of seed per bushel obtained from the Census Reports This item totaled about 200000000 The expenditures for threshing were estimnated at about 90000000 on the basis of the acreage of the crops together with information collected by the Department of Agriculture on the expenditures for threshing in the different re gions The total for all enumerated items of expense was thus about 2195000000 or 345 per farm To this was added 6 of 1 per cent of the value of farm property for taxes and a mainten ance charge of 5 per cent on the value of buildings and of 15 per cent on the value of implements and machinery bringing the total amount of farm expenses to 2947000000 This figure was in creased by 102 per cent for miscellaneous expenses including overhead charges an estimate based on Farm Management sur veys so that the total expenditures were about 3256000000 or 512 per farm leaving net earnings per farm of 724 available for family expenses for payments on indebtedness and for sav ings This amount includes the interest on the investment which at 5 per cent is 322 leaving 402 as the earnings of the average farm family The interest paid by farmers on their mortgages should be sub1916 The Farmers Income 45 tracted from their net farm earnings but not from the earnings of farm families no satisfactory statistics of mortgage indebted ness however are in existence since the census reports this infor mation only for farms operated by their owners of whom one third reported mortgages If the proportion mortgaged were the same among farms operated by tenants as that among farms operated by owners and if the average size of the mortgages were the same then the average interest on mortgages paid by farmers would amount to about 34 a year and their net earnings including interest would be 690 instead of 724 The average mortgage is probably not so high however because the farms operated by tenants are likely to have proportionately fewer mortgages and also perhaps a lower average amount of mortgage At any rate this amount would not materially affect the averages here presented One way of analyzing the farmers income is to distinguish be tween the interest on his investment the wages earned by his own labor and superintendence the value of the unpaid labor of his family and the profits of his enterprise NTo information is available for apportioning the income between these elements except that about 322 represents interest and 402 includes all the other items In addition to the direct earnings of farmers derived from the value of farm products the item of increase in the value of their property must be considered The only way of estimating this increase is by subtracting from the total value of farm property in 1910 that for 1900 and dividing the difference by ten This calculation gives an average annual increase in the value of farm property of 2055000000 or 323 per farm of which about 242 was the increase in the value of land 44 in the value of buildings 8 in the value of implements and machinery and 29 in the value of livestock A part of this increase in value is the direct result of the farmers labor in improving his farm while another part is the farmers share in the increase of the nations wealth Owing to the fact that the census of 1900 was taken in June and that of 1910 in April the increase in the value of live stock is an understatement The increase in the value of farm property in so far as it is real represents a capitalization of the increase in the value of farm products and the farmer receives interest on the increase in the shape of greater returns for his crops It is probably true however that a certain amount of the46 E A Goldenweiser March increase in the value of the land represents an overvaluation by its owners which may never be realized by them Even if it is a genuine value for 1910 the farmer may not reap the benefit of that value unless he sells his farm for the price of land may decline Thus the farmers prosperity like that of any other independent business man is dependent on a large number of factors over many of which he has no control The amount of products for a given year depends in part upon the farmers industry and foresight and in part on weather conditions the price received for the principal products sold is very largely determined by conditions in the world market and is in large measure beyond the influence of the farmer The increase in the value of his land and other property reflects the income that he received for his products during previous years and is influenced by the growth of population the extension of transportation facilities and many other factors The figures on farm income are summarized in the graph below EARNINGS OF AVERAGE FARM AND FARM FAMILY EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS GROSS EARNINGS 1236  NET EARNINGS 724  f I  W I II FAMILY EARNINGS FARM EARNS l 402 bR INTEREST  322

the capital invested in the farm and 402 by the labor of the farmer and his family The 724 of net earnings were received by the family in the following manner 303 in cash 35 as fuel 125 as rent and 261 as food furnished by the farm The limitations of these figures on farmers earnings should be clearly understood In the first place they are average figures1916 The Farmers Income 47 for the United States as a whole covering decidedly varied con ditions in different parts of the country Figures for individual localities would be more illuminating but detailed information for regions is not available It is probably true also that in the figures for the United States as a whole the errors are more likely to bal ance each other than they would be in figures for smaller areas Considerably more significant than averages would be figures giving the number of farmers in each income group but such figures do not exist It should also be mnentioned that no attempt is here iiade to draw a distinction between the income of farmers culti vating their own land and the income of tenant farmers who have to depend almost entirely on what the family earns by its labor Another limitation of the figures is that they apply to the year 1909 and mav be very different in aniy previous or subsequent year It may be said however that 1909 was a fairly representa tive year anld that the data are as satisfactory for that year as they would be for any other single year Another limitation is that the census definition of a farm includes small farms in the neighborhood of large cities whose owners derive their principal revenue from other pursuits than agriculture It should be men tioned however that no farms under 3 acres are included in the census enumeration unless they produced 250 worth of crops or gave fulltime employment to at least one man In view of the fact that there were only 18000 farms under 3 acres in 1910 forming about 3 of 1 per cent of the total number of farms and that farms of over 3 acres are probably in most cases in the hands of genuine farmers this limitation is not serious Even operators of goodsized farms often add to their income by working part of the time on other farms or at other trades but money earned in this way is not included in our figures This item is of considerable importance in some regions but would not materially affect the averages for the country as a whole Finally in stating that the average farm family earned 402 in 1909 it should be kept in mind that the cost of living on the farm is very low as compared with that in the cities The farm family produced and consumed food valued on the farm at 261 in the city this same food would cost at least 100 additional the item for rent considering accommodations would be higher than 125 in the city and fuel would cost more than 35 The 400 earned by the farm family would thus probably correspond to an income of 600 or more received by an industrial worker in the48 E A Goldenweiser March city and two thirds of the farmers have in addition the interest earned by their investment Furthermore while the farming group is not entirely or even nearly homogeneous it is neverthe less true that the extremes of wealth and poverty are not repre sented in it and that the average is not composed of as widely divergent elements as would be a similar average for an industrial group It might be said that the earnings of farm families as here given do not materially exceed the earnings of one adult farm laborer at the rate of 30 a month and board The figures do not indeed speak of large wealth and do not seem to offer brilliant opportunities for young men seeking a short road to affluence nevertheless it is probably true that the farming population of the United States consisting as it does of more than 30 million people has a larger average income per family than any other equally homogeneous group of individuals of anything like the same size anywhere in the world E A GOLDENWEISER

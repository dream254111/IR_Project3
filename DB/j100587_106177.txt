ESQUIRE,I206930,72 VI REMARKS ON A LARGER SYSTEM OF REED PIPES FROM THE ISLE OF AMSTERDAM WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE NOSE FLUTE OF OTAHEITE BY JOSHUA STEELE ESQUIRE TO SIR JOHN PRINGLE BART P R S MARGARETSTREET S I R FEB 21 1775 T H E NOTICE TAKEN OF MY SMALL ENDEA VOURS BY YOUR ILLUSTRIOUS SOCIETY DOES ME MUCH MORE HONOUR THAN I DESERVE HOWEVER I RE CEIVE IT AS I OUGHT WITH RESPECT AND GRATITUDE I NOW INCLOSE TO YOU SUCH FARTHER REMARKS AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE BY REPEATED TRIALS ON THE LAST REED PIPES YOU BROUGHT ME FROM MR BANKS WHICH THOUGH MUCH LARGER AND MORE IN NUMBER ARE OF THE SAME GENUS WITH THE FORMER I HAVE ALSO EXAMINED THE NOSEFLUTE OF OTAHEITE WHICH MR BANKS FAVOURED ME WITH AND I FIND IT GIVES ONLY FOUR SOUNDS WITH THE FIRST DEGREE OF BREATH WHICH ARE IN AN ASCENDING SERIES BY A SEMITONE A TONE AND A SEMITONE THUS NOTED IN CONSORTPITCH INTERVAL OF A SEMITONE AND A TONE AND A SEMITONE REDDE FEB 22 1775 IF73 IF URGED WITH A STRONGER BREATH IT WILL GIVE OCTAVES ABOVE THESE BUT IT THEN BECOMES ILL IN TUNE AND I UNDERSTOOD FROM MR BANKS THE NATIVES OF OTAHEITE USE NO MORE THAN THOSE FIRST FOUR SOUNDS WERE I TO GIVE THESE NOTES DENOMINATIONS ACCORDING TO OUR SYSTEM OF MUSIC THEY SHOULD BE DISTINGUISHED THUS SHARP SEVENTH KEY NOTE SECOND FLAT THIRD NOTWITHSTANDING THE SMALL EXTENT OF THIS SERIES YET BY THE AID OF VARYING THE MEASURE IT IS CAPABLE OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT MELODIES THOUGH THE GENERAL CAST OF THEM WILL BE MELANCHOLY AS FOR EXAMPLE 3  OR 2  THESE TWO SPECIMENS OF MELODY ADAPTED TO THE NOSEFLUTE ARE HARMONICALLY THE SAME V O L LXV L THOUGH74 THOUGH RHYTHMICALLY DIFFERENT THE LATTER HAVING A DE GREE OF VIVACITY MORE THAN THE FORMER IN PROPORTION TO ITS MEASURE OF TIME TWO BARS OF THE FIRST BEING EQUAL IN LENGTH TO THREE OF THE SECOND I AM SIR WITH GREAT REGARD YOUR VERY HUMBLE SERVANT J O S H U A S T E E L E REMARKS ON THE LARGER SYSTEM OF REED PIPES FROM THE ISLE OF AMSTERDAM THE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THE SMALLER SYSTEM DESCRIBED BEFORE WILL BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS IT CONSISTS OF TEN PIPES JOINED TOGETHER IN THE SAME MANNER AS THOSE OF THE SMALLER SYSTEM THE FIRST NINE PIPES EXHIBIT TO THE EYE THE SAME FIGURE AS THE SYSTEM BEFORE DESCRIBED IN THE DRAW ING AND THE TENTH PIPE WHICH IS THE ADDITIONAL IS A LITTLE LONGER THAN NO 4 FOR IN THIS LARGER SYSTEM NO 8 IS THIRTEEN INCHES LONG NO 4 THIRTEEN AND A HALF NEAR LY AND NO 10 IS FOURTEEN INCHES THE SOUNDS WHICH EACH PIPE EXHIBITS EASILY ARE MARKED IN MINIMS AS FOL LOWS AND ARE NOTED AGREEABLE TO CONSORT PITCH NO 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 AS75 AS THE UPPER MINIMS ARE SIXTHS TO THOSE NEXT UNDER THEM IT FOLLOWS FROM THE LAW OF HARMONIC SOUNDS THAT THE LOWER MINIMS ARE FIFTHS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL SOUNDS OF THESE PIPES WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN QUAVERS TO SHEW THAT THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO BE PRODUCED THE UPPER MI NIMS OF NO 1 2 3 4 5 AND ALSO OF 10 ARE SHARP THIRDS OR RATHER MAJOR TENTHS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL SOUND OF EACH PIPE AND THE UPPER MINIMS OF NO 6 7 8 AND 9 ARE NEARLY MINOR TENTHS TO THEIR FUNDAMENTALS WHICH CIRCUMSTANCE SEEMS TO AGREE WITH WHAT I REMARKED IN THE SMALLER SYSTEM AS AN EXTRAORDINARY PROPERTY TOUCH ING THE MINOR THIRDS  BUT I WILL NOT YET ASSERT THAT THIS PROPERTY IS ALTOGETHER NATURAL BECAUSE I FOUND SOME OF THESE LATTER PIPES WERE PARTLY OBSTRUCTED BY ACCIDENTAL RUBBISH WHICH WAS DRAWN OUT WITH DIFFICULTY SO THAT I PRETEND NOT TO DECIDE WHETHER THE CAUSE OF THEIR BE ING NOT QUITE IN THE SAME PROPORTION OF TURNE AS I FOUND IN THE FIRST SYSTEM ARISES FROM SOME CASUAL INJURY OR FROM ORIGINAL INTENTION OR ORIGINAL INACCURACY  I HAVE SAID THE UPPER MINIMS OF NO 6 7 8 AND 9 ARE NEARLY MINOR TENTHS TO THEIR FUNDAMENTALS BECAUSE IN FACT I FOUND THEM SOMETHING MORE THAN MINOR AND YET NOT MAJOR WHEREFORE I HAVE USED THE MARK  OF A TRIPLE CROSS TO SIGNIFY SOMETHING MORE THAN  THE DOUBLE CROSS AND THE MARK OF X A SINGLE CROSS TO SIGNIFY A DIESIS OR SOMETHING LESS THAN  THE DOUBLE CROSS WHICH LAST IN THE MODERN PRACTICE OF MUSIC ALWAYS MEANS TO SAY PLUS A SEMITONE NEITHER MORE OR LESS FOR THOUGH  AND  REFERRED TO FROM THE FOLLOWING PAGE L 2 THE76 THE NICETY OF THE DIESIS IS STEALING INSENSIBLY INTO THE FAN CY OF SINGERS AND OF SOME OTHER ELEGANT MUSICAL PERFOR MERS IT IS NOT AS YET ADOPTED OR USED AS SUCH IN THE NOTA TION OF MODERN MUSIC THE INTERVAL BETWEEN NO 1 AND 2 IN THESE PIPES IS ONLY OF TWO SEMITONES WHEREAS THAT BETWEEN THE NO 1 AND 2 OF THE FORMER SYSTEM WAS OF THREE SEMITONES THE SERIES NO 2 3 4 AND 5 AND THE SERIES NO 6 7 8 AND 9 BOTH OF WHICH I HAVE DISTINCTLY MARKED WITHIN BARS HAVE SIMILAR INTERVALS IN BOTH SYS TEMS MAKING ALLOWANCE FOR WHAT I HAVE SAID IN PAGE 75  AND  WHEREFORE I IMAGINE THESE TO HAVE BEEN THE ORIGINAL EXTENT OF THE WHOLE MODULATING SERIES LIKE THE DOUBLE TETRACHORD OF THE GREEKS AND THAT THE NO 1 AND NO 10 ARE ADDITIONALS AT PLEASURE AS IN THE SMAL LER SYSTEM THE INTERVAL BETWEEN NO 1 AND 2 WAS A SE MITONE GREATER THAN THAT BETWEEN NO 1 AND 2 IN THE LARGER SYSTEM AND NO 10 IN THE SMALLER SYSTEM FIRST EXAMINED WAS TOTALLY OMITTED THOUGH I HAVE SEEN TWO OTHERS WHICH HAD IT THE SOUNDS IN THIS LARGER SYSTEM ARE SEVEN TONES LOWER THAN THOSE OF THE SMALLER WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH THE DIFFERENCE OF THEIR DIMENSIONS THE PIPE NO 4 IN THIS SYSTEM MEASURING NEARLY THIRTEEN INCHES AND A HALF IN LENGTH WITH DIAMETER SEEMINGLY PROPORTIONAL WHEREAS THE NO 4 IN THE SMALLER SYSTEM MEASURED ONLY SEVEN INCHES AND A QUARTER BY INCREAS ING THE VELOCITY OF THE BLAST I FOUND THESE PIPES GAVE SOUNDS STILL HIGHER WHICH WERE FOURTHS ABOVE THE UPPER MINIMS OR OCTAVE AND SIXTHS ABOVE THE FUNDAMENTALS AND WITH A LITTLE MORE FORCE TRITONES OR SHARP FOURTHS ABOVE77 ABOVE THE UPPER MINIMS WHICH WERE OCTAVE AND FLAT SE VENTHS ABOVE THE FUNDAMENTALS BUT THESE TWO THE 4TH AND SHARP 4TH ABOVE THE UPPER MINIMS SHOULD RATHER BE CONSIDERED AS ONE NOTE OF LATITUDE WHICH BY MORE OR LESS VELOCITY OR FORCE OF BREATH MAKES IN THE NO 1 2 3 4 5 AND 10 EITHER A SHARP 6TH OR A FLAT 7TH TO EACH OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OR IN THE NO 6 7 8 AND 9 EITHER A FLAT OR A SHARP 6TH FLAT 6TH SHARP 6TH SHARP 6TH FLAT 7TH FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTAL NO 8 NO 10 THIS NOTE OF LATITUDE IS COMMON TO ALL TUBES TRUM PETS HORNS C THE FOLLOWING NOTES MARK THE ASCENDING SERIES OF THE SOUNDS OF THIS LARGER SYSTEM OMITTING THE FUNDA MENTALS AND GIVING ONLY THOSE WHICH ARE MORE EASILY OBTAINED THE NUMERICAL FIGURES SHEW FROM WHICH PIPE THE NOTES WERE PRODUCED NO 1078 3 7 NO 10 4 8 5 9 2 6 1 FIFTHS ABOVE THE SUPPOSED FUNDAMENTALS PRODUCED BY A GENTLE BLAST 3 7 NO 10 4 8 5 9 2 6 1 TIERCES OR TENTHS ABOVE THE SUPPOSED FUNDA MENTALS PRODUCED BY A STRONGER BLAST VII DESCRIPTION

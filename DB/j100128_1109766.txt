j100128,Columbia Law Review,1109766,Abandonment of Felonious Design as Affecting Premeditation in Murder,i246246,was with child or not Bract 1 2 c 32 Co Litt 8 b Thus the writ was granted to save innocent life and where the party withhold ing the best evidence was at the same time attempting to convict the defendant of felony Its only use in a civil case was to protect the rightful succession to property thus affecting not merely the parties to the suit but frustrating an attempt which the rigor of the Gothic constitutions esteemed equivalent to the most atrocious theft and therefore punished with death I B Com 456 In view there fore of the common law theory that no man is bound to furnish his adversary with evidence strengthened here by the sanctity of the right of personal freedom the principal case seems correct in refusing to extend the right to compulsory physical examination beyond the few cases extraordinary in their circumstances in which it was allowed in early common law The need for such examination is often urgent where for example the defendants only argument is to discredit the plaintiffs witnesses but it would seem to be for the legislature and not the courts to remedy this lack of power ABANDONMENT OF FELONIOUS DESIGN AS AFFECTING PREMEDITATION IN MURDERMurder in the first degree under the clause in most penal codes defining it as a wilful deliberate and premeditated kill ing consists of two distinct elements both of which must concur i an act amounting to murder at common law and 2 the addi tional element of deliberation and premeditation Despite attempted distinctions these latter terms seem practically synonymous They mean that the defendant while in a cool and rational state of mind considered whether or not he should kill the deceased and decided definitely to kill him McClain Crim Law  358 People v Baw kins i888 Io9 N Y 408 People v Barberi I896 149 N Y 256 Keenan v Commonwealth i862 44 Pa St 55 The deliberation and premeditation must occur before the act and continue thereto This principle is well illustrated in those cases holding that where A assaults B with intent to murder but during the conflict withdraws and in good faith gives up his original design he is again remitted to his right of selfdefense and if forced to kill B to protect himself will not be guilty of murder Hale P C 482 Stofen v State 1864 15 Ohio St 47 Parker v State 1889 88 Ala 4 People v Button x895 xo6 Cal 628 State v Shockley I905 80 Pac 865 In view of these well settled rules a recent decision in California is worthy of notice The defendant was a member of an armed gang that went to rob a safe Finding the premises guarded they abandoned this plan and started back encountering some time later an officer who apparently undertook to arrest and search them A melee ensued in which the officer was shot and killed On appeal the Supreme Court affirmed a conviction of murder in the first degree holding that the evidence of preparations to kill made in connection with the projected burglary was sufficient proof of deliberate purpose State v Woods 9go5 8t Pac 652 It would seem that the court might well have found sufficient evidence of deliberation and pre meditation to commit murder upon the appearance of the officer and during the melee State v Brown 1889 41 Minn 319 State v NOTES 541COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW Duncan I893 II6 Mo 288 Miller v State goo 130 Ala i For although premeditation is required the length of time over which it extends is immaterial and it is sufficient if the defendant was able to exercise his judgment and to form a definite purpose State v Brown I889 41 Minn 319 State v Murray 1894 25 Ore 241 The California court does not notice this position but places its affirmance squarely upon the ground that the defendants original crim inal intent in arming himself for the proposed felony carried over after the abandonment of that plan and colored his subsequent independent act As a principle of law this attitude is difficult to support and it would be interesting to know to what extent the learned Court would carry it It would seem to be an extreme construction to hold that because the defendant had determined to kill anyone who might in terfere with him in committing burglary that he therefore intended to kill anyone who might try to arrest him for some other offense e g carrying concealed weapons after he had wholly abandoned his felonious plan THE NEW YORK ELEVATED RAILWAY CASESThe recent case of Muhlker v N   Harlem R R I905 197 U S 544 marks an interesting phase in the history of the Elevated Railway Cases but unfortunately leaves the ultimate fate of those decisions more con jectural than ever When this case was before the State court it was held that the doctrine of the Story case to the effect that a man had a property right to easements in the street for the infringement of which he could recover did not apply where the railroad had been ordered by the legislature to elevate its structure See 2 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW I58 3 Id 347 An appeal was taken to the United States Supreme Court upon the ground that the Act of 1892 compelling the defendant to ele vate its tracks did not provide compensation for the damage to the plaintiffs easements over the street and therefore violated the obliga tion of a contract in two regards first it violated the obligation of the contract made by New York City when it purchased the fee of Park Avenue from the plaintiffs predecessor and covenanted to keep the same open as a street and second it violated the obligation of the contract by which the plaintiff acquired the property since it disre garded the doctrine of the Story case which being law at the time the plaintiff acquired his property became part of his contract of purchase The Supreme Court while expressing its approval of the first ground assigned expressly based its decision upon the second but without citing any authorities The principle is not entirely novel Bronson v Kinzie 1843 i How 31 1 MlcCraken v Hayward 1844 2 How 608 These cases lay down the doctrine that the  obligation  of a con tract includes all the laws in force when the contract is made and applicable thereto Any modification of these laws is therefore uncon stitutional in so far as it affects contracts made under them Re ferring to the merits of the question involved in the Story case the U S Court expressed itself as being entirely satisfied with the prin ciples therein laid down Despite this endorsement the Court of Appeals shortly thereafter held Bennet v L I Ry Co NY 9o5 74 N E 418 that an abutting owner suffered no legal injury from an elevated structure of a surface 542

liquor is an article of interstate commerce The question was first presented to the state courts and they apparently departing from their former views sus tained the right of the state to regulate the business of soliciting on the ground that the contract is really made in the state where the vendee is to receive the liquor Hart v State 39 So 523 Jones v Surprise 9 Atl Rep 384 Lang v Lynch 38 Fed 489 4 L R A 83I The latter court says solic iting orders for the purchase of liquors constitutes a part of the transaction in the sale of the same The analagous cases may be mentioned where a state prohibits the soliciting of insurance for foreign insurance companies that have not complied with the states insurance laws The courts invariably assert the right to punish such solicitors who violate the law The Massachusetts courts says while the Legislature can not impair the freedom of M to elect with whom he will contract it can prevent the foreign insurers from shelter ing themselves under his freedom to solicit contracts which otherwise he would not have thought of making 175 Mass 154 affirmed in I83 U S 553 I55 U S 648 The court in Delamater v State considers this right to solicit orders which previously existed as an incident to the right to ship the liquors into another state as an article of interstate commerce and as such there sell the same in the original packages But as the right to sell after importation is taken away by the Wilson Act it follows logically that the incidental right to solicit proposals to purchase intoxicating liquors no longer exists A single conflicting decision has been noticed that of the Michigan court in Sloman v Moeb Co Io2 N W 854 which holds that where a whole saler contracted in Michigan to sell defendant whiskey shipped from Ohio the vendor was engaged in interstate commerce and was not required to comply with the laws of Michigan in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquors at wholesale within the state CONSTITUTIONAL LAWEQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWSTATE STATUTE The Illinois mining act entitled An Act to Revise the Laws in Relation to Coal Mines and Subjects Relating Thereto and Providing for the Health and Safety of Persons Employed Therein Laws of I899 p 300 Ill Rev Stat Chap 93 requires the selection of mine managers and mine examiners from among those holding licenses issued by the state mining board created by the statute and as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Illinois imposes upon mine owners responsibility for the defaults of said employees In an action against a mine owner for the death of an employee alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the mine manager it was contended that the above statute was unconstitutional in that it violated the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution The United StatesSupreme Court held the statute constitutional Wilmington Star Mining Company v Fulton 1907 27 Sup Ct Rep 412 The basis of the objection to the statute is the alleged incompatibility between the responsibility of the mine owner and the obligation imposed upon him to employ only persons licensed by the state Statutes similar in their general purpose have been enacted in Pennsylvania and West Virginia and 69oRECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS these statutes were dealt with in Durkin v Kingston Coal Co 171 Pa St I93 33 Atl Rep 237 29 L R A 808 50 Am St Rep 8oi and Williams v Thacker Coal and Coke Co 44 W Va 599 30 S E Rep IO7 40 L R A 812 The Pennsylvania statute was determined by the Supreme Court of that state in the case above cited to be unconstitutional it was also there said that the mining foreman is a fellowservant of the other employees of the same master engaged in a common business that the duty of the mine owner is to employ competent foremen to direct his operations and that when he does this he discharges the full measure of his duty to his employees and is not liable for an injury arising from the negligence of the foreman The West Virginia court followed the decision in the Pennsylvania case The Illinois courts have refused to follow the Pennsylvania and West Virginia cases and in Henrietta Coal Co v Martin 221 Ill 460 77 N E Rep 902 expressly held that under the Illinois mining act a mine manager and mine examiner were viceprincipals of the ownerand were engaged in the performance of duties which the owner could not delegate to others in such manner as to relieve himself from responsibility The same court has also held Consoli dated Coal Co v Seniger 179 Ill 370 53 N E Rep 733 that it is not obli gatory upon a mine owner to select a particular individual or to retain one when selected if found incompetent and it is because of this construction of the statute that the Federal Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the statute in question is not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution The principal case on a former appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals is reported in

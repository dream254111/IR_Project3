children are in most states made by statute heir to the adoptive parent19 Nor can these enactments be interpreted like that in the principal case as mere assignments of the states rights of escheat since they frequently provide that the statutory heir shall inherit share and share alike with the natural heirs of the intestate20 in which case there is of course no right of escheat to be assigned In view therefore of the differences which from the earliest days have marked the rules of descent not only as between different coun tries but also within the realm of England and which now distin guish our American statutory laws of inheritance it is difficult to sustain the elaborate and artificial interpretation placed upon the statute under consideration in the principal case It is submitted that statutory heirs should be accorded all the rights including cita tion to the probate of a will which the law confers upon those heirs who have been said to be created by natural law2 VALIDITY OF CORPORATIONS FORMED THROUGH DuMIs BY OTHER CORPORATONSIn view of the prevalence of the practice among cor porations of organiing subsidiaries and the frequency with which dummies are used in the creation of these and other corporations it is surprising how little the validity of such corporate organizations has been adjudicated While every corporation exists by virtue of the action of the state creating it which may vary with every juris diction and every corporation therein nevertheless in all the states of this country the legislatures have adopted general corporation laws substantially similar in character Some of these authorize any per sons not less than a specified number to form a corporation but many others in addition require a stock subscription by the incorpo rators Where the latter form of legislation prevails the creation of a corporation by other corporations would immediately raise the question of the right of one corporation to hold stock in another In this country it used to be generally regarded as ultra vires for one private corporation to acquire the stock of another2 except pos Ibid 3152 B g New Mexico Statutes Codification 1915 1850 Ibid

an authorization might be in cluded in the articles of a corporation organized under a general law silent on the subject is a point on which authorities differ4 But now by charter and general law corporations are usually endowed with the power of holding stocks in other corporations5 Since the method of acquisition is usually unlimited it would seem to include subscription to the stock of new corporations6 A corporation may thus subscribe directly and one with the right to subscribe may ordi narily exercise the right by an agent or trustee7 Even if the prin cipal were incompetent the actual subscriber might be held person ally liable and the subscription would be valid8 But various cases have denied the right to subscribe when the corporation by so doing would act as an incorporator9 Whether or not an incorporator is required to be a stockholder the capacity of a corporation to act as such is the essential question which we must consider It has never been seriously contended that a corporation could sign the articles in its own name but the general practice is rather for officers or agents to sign individually in behalf of the company This has been called an attempt to do indirectly what cannot be done directly10 But it is usually regarded as sufficient to have the formali ties complied withl and one man who could not by himself form a corporation is generally allowed to do so by signing with members of his family or clerks as dummies2 Nominal incorporators are SHowe v Boston Carpet Co 1860 82 Mass 493 see Converse v Emer son Talcott  Co 1909 242

by persons connected with a law firm in the interest of three other cor porations who subscribed to the stock was held to have an existence de facto at least in the recent case of Kardo Co v Adams 0 0 A 6th Cir Feb 18 1916 not yet reported This decision like many others on this subject5 needed to establish a corporation de facto only the existence of which is recognized by the federal courts in spite of lack of capacity on the part of the incorporators1 But Judge Hollister in his opinion seems to regard the method of incor poration as satisfying the requirements of the statute17 This appears in keeping with authority and with the policy of the law which recog nizes the importance for industrial development of allowing one cor poration to control another by stock ownershipl8 If a corporation may purchase the control of an existing corporation adapted to its needs it is equally essential that it may instigate the organization of a new corporation to answer this need when none already existsl9 The only method possible and the one sanctioned by general blsiness usage and judicial acceptance is through the medium of agents IhQUIDATION AND DISSOLUTION OF NATIONAL BANmSOne of the various means by which it is sometimes said that a corporation may be dissolved is a voluntary dissolution by vote of the stockholders By the weight of authority however such a resolution by the

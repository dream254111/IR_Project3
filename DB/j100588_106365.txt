experiment of determining the universal at traction of matter which you lately conducted with so much accuracy and success is of so great im VOL LXX B portance2 Doctor HUTTONS Determination of the portance and curiosity that it may probably be here after repeated by the learned in other countries and in other situations and as the utmost precision is desirable in so nice an experiment I have composed the inclosed paper to determine the best part of a hill for making the observations so as to obtain the greatest quantity of attraction I have no doubt Sir that the determination of this point will appear of some consequence in the opinion of one who has the improvement of useful knowledge so much at heart and if the manner in which it is here made meet your approbation I shall desire the favour of your presenting it to the Royal Society I have the honour to be c 1 ThePlace of greatest Attraction 3 1 The great success of the experiment lately made by the Royal Society on the hill Schehallien to deter mine the universal attraction of matter and the im portant consequences that have resulted from it may probably give occasion to other experiments of the same kind to be made elsewhere and as all possible means of accuracy and facility are to be desired in so delicate and laborious an undertaking it has occurred to me that it might not be unuseful to add by way of sup plement to my paper of calculations relative to the a bovementioned experiment an investigation of the height above the bottom of a hill at which its horizon tal attraction shall be the greatest since that is the height at which commonly the observations ought to be made and since this best point of observation has never been any where determined that I know of but has been va riously spoken of or guessed at it being sometimes ac counted at 13 and sometimes at 12 of the height of the hill whereas from these investigations it is found to be generally at about only 14 of the altitude from the bottom 2 Let ABCEDA be part of a cuneus of matter its sides or faces being the two similar rightangled trian gles ABC ADE meeting in the point A and forming the indefinitely small angle BAD Then of

the place where the attraction of a hill is greatest it will be necessary to suppose the hill to have some certain fi gure That position is most convenient for observing the attraction in which the hill is most extended in the east and west direction Supposing then such a position of a hill and that it is also of a uniform height and meridional section throughout the point of observa tion must evidently be equally distant from the two ends But instead of being only considerably extended I shall suppose the hill to be indefinitely extended to the east and to the west of the point of observation in order that the investigation may be mathematically true and yet at the same time sufficiently exact for the before said limited extent also It will also come nearest to the 1 practicalPlace of greatest Attraction 7 practical experiment to suppose the hill to be a long triangular prism so that all its meridional sections may be similar triangles Let therefore the triangle ABC re present its section by a verti B cal plane passing through the meridian or one side of an H P D E F indefinitely thin cuneus whose edge is in PG or rather A G I  PBCGP the side of one cuneus and PAG the side of another their common edge being the line PG perpendicular to the base AC P being the required point in the side AB where the attrac tion of the section ABC or indefinitely thin cuneus shall be greatest in a direction parallel to the horizon AC And then from the foregoing suppositions it is evident that in whatever point of AB the attraction of ABC is greatest there also will the attraction of the whole hill be the greatest 8 Now draw HPDEF parallel to AC and AH PG BI CF perpendicular to the same Then it is evident that at the point P in the direction PF the attraction of PBCGP is affirmative and that of PAG negative But PBCGP is  PBD  BDE  PFCG  EFC and PAG  PHAG  PHA Therefore the attractions of PBD BDE PFCG PHA are affirmative and those of EFC PHAG negative Put8

substituted which any practical case may require and the fluxion of this at traction be put  0 the root of the resulting equation will be the required height from the bottom of the hill 10 But for a more particular solution in simpler terms let us suppose the triangle ABC to be isosceles in which case we shall have d  e and g  2b  2c and then the above general formula will become 2ad  qq  dxdd b  x X h l 2ab  qq  bxb  d x s X  a  xd3 2b3 X h l 2ab2  dq2  b2  a2 x2b2 a  x for the value of the attraction in the case of the isos celes triangle where q2 is   4a2b2  4ab2x  d2x2 And the fluxion of this expression being equated to 0 the equation will give the relation between a and x for any values of b and d by a process not very trouble some 11 Now it is probable that the relation between a and x when the attraction is greatest will vary with the various relations between b and d or between b and a Let us therefore find the limits of that relation between which it may always be taken by using two particular extreme cases the one in which the hill is VOL LXX C very10 Doctor HUTTONS Determination of the very steep and the other in which it is very flat or a very small in respect of b or d 12 And first let us suppose the triangular section to be equilateral in which case the angle of elevation is 60 which being a degree of steepness that can scarce ly ever happen this may be accounted the first extreme case Here then we shall have d  2b  23a3 and the formula in Art 10 will become s X 2a  r  x2  x X h l 2a  2r  x3x  a  x4 X h l a  2r  xa  x for the value of the attraction in the case of the equilateral triangle in which r is   a2  ax  x2 13 Or if we take x  na where n expresses what part of a is denoted by x the last formula will become sa X 1  12n  12  1  n  n2  n X h

this equation 1  1  n 1  n  n2  2 h l 2  n  2  1  n  n23n  12 h l 1  n  2  1  n  n21  n the root of which is n 251999 Which shews that in the equilateral triangle the height from the bottom to the point of greatest attraction is onlyPlace of greatest Attraction 11 only 1500th part more than 14 of the whole altitude of the triangle And this is the limit for the steepest kind of hills 15 Let us find now the particular values of the mea sure of attraction arising by taking certain values of n varying by some small difference in order to discover what part of the greatest attraction is wanting by ob serving at different altitudes 16 And first using the value of n 251999 as found in the 14th article the general formula in Art 13 gives sa X 10763700 for the measure of the greatest at traction

attraction is continually less and less the higher we ascend up the hill above the251999 part or in round numbers252 part of the altitude Let us now descend by trying the numbers below252 and first 21

23 and 34 of the greatest attraction being some thing greater than 23 but less than 34 of it 25 The annexed table exhibits a summary of the 610 8109843 14 calculations made in the preceding 510 9340963 213 articles where the first column 410 10224232 120 shews at what part of the altitude 310 10702512 1180 of the hill the observation is made 2521000 10763700 0 the second column contains the 14 10763589 197852 210 10684622 1134 corresponding numbers which are 110 9986188 114 proportional to the attraction and 0 7746531 27 the third column shews what part of the greatest attraction is lost at each respective place of observation or how much each is less than the greatest 26 Having now so fully illustrated the case of the first extreme or limit let us search what is the limit for the other extreme that is when the hill is very low or flat In this case b is nearly equal to d and they are both very great in respect of a consequently the for mula for the attraction in Art 10 will become barely s x x x h l 2a  xx  2 a  x x h l 2a  xa  x the fluxion of which being put  0 we obtain 0  h l 2a  xx  2 h l 2a  xa  x  h l 2a  xx  h l 2a  xa  x2  h l a  2x 2 a  x hence therefore a  x2  x 2 a  x and x  a x 1  12  2929a14 Doctor HUTTONs Determination c 2929a Which shews that the other limit is 29100 that is when the hill is extremely low the point of great est attraction is at 29100 of the altitude like as it is at 25100 when the hill is very steep And between these limits it is always found it being nearer to the one or the other of them as the hill is flatter or steeper 27 Thus then we find that at 14 of the altitude or very little more is the best place for observation to have the greatest attraction from a hill in the form of a tri angular prism of an indefinite length But when its length is limited the point of greatest attraction will descend a little lower and the shorter the hill is the lower will that point descend For the same reason all pyramidal hills have their place of greatest attraction a little below that above determined But if the hill have a considerable space flat at the top after the manner of a frustum then the said point will be a little higher than as above found Commonly however 14 of the altitude may be used for the best place of observation as the point of greatest attraction will seldom differ sensibly from that place And when uncommon circumstances may produce a difference too great to be intirely neglect ed the observer must exercise his judgment in guessing at the necessary change he ought to make in the place of observation so as to obtain the best effect which the concomitant circumstances will admit of

EXPERIMENT OF DETERMINING THE UNIVERSAL AT TRACTION OF MATTER WHICH YOU LATELY CONDUCTED WITH SO MUCH ACCURACY AND SUCCESS IS OF SO GREAT IM VOL LXX B PORTANCE2 DOCTOR HUTTONS DETERMINATION OF THE PORTANCE AND CURIOSITY THAT IT MAY PROBABLY BE HERE AFTER REPEATED BY THE LEARNED IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND IN OTHER SITUATIONS AND AS THE UTMOST PRECISION IS DESIRABLE IN SO NICE AN EXPERIMENT I HAVE COMPOSED THE INCLOSED PAPER TO DETERMINE THE BEST PART OF A HILL FOR MAKING THE OBSERVATIONS SO AS TO OBTAIN THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF ATTRACTION I HAVE NO DOUBT SIR THAT THE DETERMINATION OF THIS POINT WILL APPEAR OF SOME CONSEQUENCE IN THE OPINION OF ONE WHO HAS THE IMPROVEMENT OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE SO MUCH AT HEART AND IF THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS HERE MADE MEET YOUR APPROBATION I SHALL DESIRE THE FAVOUR OF YOUR PRESENTING IT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE C 1 THEPLACE OF GREATEST ATTRACTION 3 1 THE GREAT SUCCESS OF THE EXPERIMENT LATELY MADE BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY ON THE HILL SCHEHALLIEN TO DETER MINE THE UNIVERSAL ATTRACTION OF MATTER AND THE IM PORTANT CONSEQUENCES THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM IT MAY PROBABLY GIVE OCCASION TO OTHER EXPERIMENTS OF THE SAME KIND TO BE MADE ELSEWHERE AND AS ALL POSSIBLE MEANS OF ACCURACY AND FACILITY ARE TO BE DESIRED IN SO DELICATE AND LABORIOUS AN UNDERTAKING IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE UNUSEFUL TO ADD BY WAY OF SUP PLEMENT TO MY PAPER OF CALCULATIONS RELATIVE TO THE A BOVEMENTIONED EXPERIMENT AN INVESTIGATION OF THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE BOTTOM OF A HILL AT WHICH ITS HORIZON TAL ATTRACTION SHALL BE THE GREATEST SINCE THAT IS THE HEIGHT AT WHICH COMMONLY THE OBSERVATIONS OUGHT TO BE MADE AND SINCE THIS BEST POINT OF OBSERVATION HAS NEVER BEEN ANY WHERE DETERMINED THAT I KNOW OF BUT HAS BEEN VA RIOUSLY SPOKEN OF OR GUESSED AT IT BEING SOMETIMES AC COUNTED AT 13 AND SOMETIMES AT 12 OF THE HEIGHT OF THE HILL WHEREAS FROM THESE INVESTIGATIONS IT IS FOUND TO BE GENERALLY AT ABOUT ONLY 14 OF THE ALTITUDE FROM THE

THE PLACE WHERE THE ATTRACTION OF A HILL IS GREATEST IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE THE HILL TO HAVE SOME CERTAIN FI GURE THAT POSITION IS MOST CONVENIENT FOR OBSERVING THE ATTRACTION IN WHICH THE HILL IS MOST EXTENDED IN THE EAST AND WEST DIRECTION SUPPOSING THEN SUCH A POSITION OF A HILL AND THAT IT IS ALSO OF A UNIFORM HEIGHT AND MERIDIONAL SECTION THROUGHOUT THE POINT OF OBSERVA TION MUST EVIDENTLY BE EQUALLY DISTANT FROM THE TWO ENDS BUT INSTEAD OF BEING ONLY CONSIDERABLY EXTENDED I SHALL SUPPOSE THE HILL TO BE INDEFINITELY EXTENDED TO THE EAST AND TO THE WEST OF THE POINT OF OBSERVATION IN ORDER THAT THE INVESTIGATION MAY BE MATHEMATICALLY TRUE AND YET AT THE SAME TIME SUFFICIENTLY EXACT FOR THE BEFORE SAID LIMITED EXTENT ALSO IT WILL ALSO COME NEAREST TO THE 1 PRACTICALPLACE OF GREATEST ATTRACTION 7 PRACTICAL EXPERIMENT TO SUPPOSE THE HILL TO BE A LONG TRIANGULAR PRISM SO THAT ALL ITS MERIDIONAL SECTIONS MAY BE SIMILAR TRIANGLES LET THEREFORE THE TRIANGLE

CUNEUS SHALL BE GREATEST IN A DIRECTION PARALLEL TO THE HORIZON AC AND THEN FROM THE FOREGOING SUPPOSITIONS IT IS EVIDENT THAT IN WHATEVER POINT OF AB THE ATTRACTION OF ABC IS GREATEST THERE ALSO WILL THE ATTRACTION OF THE WHOLE HILL BE THE GREATEST 8 NOW DRAW HPDEF PARALLEL TO AC AND AH PG BI CF PERPENDICULAR TO THE SAME THEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT AT THE POINT P IN THE DIRECTION PF THE ATTRACTION OF

OF THE ALTITUDE LIKE AS IT IS AT 25100 WHEN THE HILL IS VERY STEEP AND BETWEEN THESE LIMITS IT IS ALWAYS FOUND IT BEING NEARER TO THE ONE OR THE OTHER OF THEM AS THE HILL IS FLATTER OR STEEPER 27 THUS THEN WE FIND THAT AT 14 OF THE ALTITUDE OR VERY LITTLE MORE IS THE BEST PLACE FOR OBSERVATION TO HAVE THE GREATEST ATTRACTION FROM A HILL IN THE FORM OF A TRI ANGULAR PRISM OF AN INDEFINITE LENGTH BUT WHEN ITS LENGTH IS LIMITED THE POINT OF GREATEST ATTRACTION WILL DESCEND A LITTLE LOWER AND THE SHORTER THE HILL IS THE LOWER WILL THAT POINT DESCEND FOR THE SAME REASON ALL PYRAMIDAL HILLS HAVE THEIR PLACE OF GREATEST ATTRACTION A LITTLE BELOW THAT ABOVE DETERMINED BUT IF THE HILL HAVE A CONSIDERABLE SPACE FLAT AT THE TOP AFTER THE MANNER OF A FRUSTUM THEN THE SAID POINT WILL BE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN AS ABOVE FOUND COMMONLY HOWEVER 14 OF THE ALTITUDE MAY BE USED FOR THE BEST PLACE OF OBSERVATION AS THE POINT OF GREATEST ATTRACTION WILL SELDOM DIFFER SENSIBLY FROM THAT PLACE AND WHEN UNCOMMON CIRCUMSTANCES MAY PRODUCE A DIFFERENCE TOO GREAT TO BE INTIRELY NEGLECT ED THE OBSERVER MUST EXERCISE HIS JUDGMENT IN GUESSING AT THE NECESSARY CHANGE HE OUGHT TO MAKE IN THE PLACE OF OBSERVATION SO AS TO OBTAIN THE BEST EFFECT WHICH THE CONCOMITANT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ADMIT OF

1 IX Experiments and observations on the developement of mag netical properties in steel and iron by percussion Part II By WILLIAM SCORESBY Jun F R S E c Commuii cated by Sir HUMPHRY DAVY Bart Pres R S Read January 29 1824 HAV i N G had the honour of laying before the Royal Society a Paper on the  Developement of Magnetical Properties in Steel and Iron by percussion I beg permission to add to that Communication an account of other experiments in which much higher degrees of magnetic energy were ob tained by percussion in the employment of new combinations of rods of iron not previously magnetic It was shown in the former paper that the extraordinary developement of magnetism by this process arose from the use of a large bar of iron or soft steel first rendered mag netic by hammering irt the position of the dipping needle or in the direction of the magnetic force for on applying a similar quantity of percussion to the same bar whilst held on a mass of brass or stone or even on a bar of iron laid in the plane of the magnetic equator the polarity elicited did not exceed the twentyninth part of that obtained by the use of the vertical rod of iron In the subsequent experiments I had two principal objects  Philosophical Transactions for 1822 p 241198 Mr SCORESBYS experiments and observations on the ill view First to try by a new combination of auxiliary rods of iron to attain still higher degrees of magnetic energy and Secondly to endeavour to ascertain on what circum stances as to the magnitude of the rods of iron and the quality size and temper of the steel wires the highest suc cess of the experiment depends In the experiments formerly detailed a single rod of iron was used and the steel bars or wires were hammered upon it whilst both were held in a vertical position in which case the magnetism of the iron after hammering was em ployed in aid of the power of percussion for the develope ment of the magnetism of the steel bars But the magnetism of the iron rods was communicated only to the lower or north end of the steel bars the polarity of the upper or south end being merely consequential Hence it appeared pro bable that were the steel bars or wires placed between two rods of iron and thus subjected either directly or indirectly through the medium of the upper rod to percussion they would derive the advantage of the magnetism of both rods of iron acting consistently and at the same time upon their northern and southern poles so as I apprehended by the use of equal rods of iron to double the quantity of attraction formerly developed in the steel As however two long rods of iron were not so easily managed as a long one for below and a shorter for above I prepared my rods on this plan though with the expectation of sacrificing a proportion of power The rods I ordered for the experiment were of the re spective lengths of three feet and one foot and an inch indevelopement of magnetical properties in steel and iron c 199 diameter The weight of the former was 8lbs and of the latter 2lbs The end of the larger rod I i designed to be kept upward was made conical with the view of con centrating its magnetic force but this was truncated at the diameter of a quarter of an inch and a shallow hole drilled in the centre for steadying the steel wires when hammered the lower ends of which wires were rounded into a blunt point so as to fit the depression in tlle top of the iron rod The lower end of the shorter rod I ii was constructed in a similar manner As I could not hammer this conical extremity of the large iron rod without destroying its form and face I made use of another iron rod I iii corresponding in size and weight with the rod I ii but having its lower extremity hollowed like a cup to fit upon the conical termination of the larger rod I i  The larger rod was genlerally hammered before each experiment through the medium of this shorter rod I iii which not only served to preserve the other rod from injury but at the same time tended to augment its magnetism In experiments with this apparatus then after eliciting some magnetic energy in the rod I i by hammering it in the way just described the steel wire intended for receiving the magnetism was placed between the two rods with the conical  To prevent circumlocution I have distinguished the rods and wires used in the following experiments by the initial letters

terminations fI i and I iij the whole three sub stances forming a continuous straight line in lii a vertical position as in the annexed figure The upper end of the upper rod I ii being now s beaten with a small hammer acquired mag netical properties which were communicated to the steel wire whilst the lower rod receiv ing some influence from the percussion per h1 formed a similar office This kind of experi  ment I have in the subsequent details de nominated the compound process whilst the hammering of a wire upon the principal rod I i only without the use of the second rod Lff is called the simple process To give the experiments the best chance I made use en tirely of steel wire such as is employed by watchmakers which I found from several comparisons and experiments that I did not think it necessary to detail here had a much higher capacity for magnetism thus developed than any other steel that I tried and for obtaining the best effect in the trial of the lifting power produced in the steel wires by percussion I procured a series of nails of different weights made of good iron with flat heads so as to stand with their points upward in which position they are the most readily lifted  and after blunting their points I gave them some de gree of polish for improving the contact  The hammer employed in all the subsequent experiments weighed eleven ounces inclusive of the shaft Some trials were made with a larger hammer but its tendency to bend the wires was so great as more than to counterbalance the advantage it gave of a more speedy developement of magnetic energy This larger hammer however weighing twentyfive ounces was generally used for beating the iron rods before the different experiments when it was of decided advantagedevelopement of magnetical properties in

its lifting power was 482  90  572 being a loss of 90 grains MDCCCXXIV E e21o Mr SCORESBYS experiments and observations on the GENERAL REMARKS The results of the foregoing experiments were in general satisfactory though there were some trifling anomalies which will be noticed in their order The chief points I had in view were tolerably well determined but the investigation is so far from being complete that what has been done as is often the case in such researches opens a much wider field of en quiry than I at first contemplated I proceed however to state the chief results obtained consisting of such deductions as I trust the experiments will be considered legitimately to warrant i One principal object of enquiry in these experiments was to prove the effect of a combination of rods of iron on a plan previously arranged for augmenting the magnetic power by percussion The result was in the main perfectly agreeable to my expectations For by the employment of such a combination which I have denominated the compound process the magnetism developed was always more or less increased but the proportion of augmentation was by no means regular nor is the law by which it is governed very obvious In experiment No II the maximum effect of the simple process was an attractive force capable of lifting between 186 and 246 grains whilst the compound process readily augmented the lifting power to 326 grains And on repeating the trial Experiment III on the simple process the wire obtained a lifting power of 246 grains which the compound process increased to 345 But the advantage was the most obvious in experiment No VIII when a very short piece of wire was used In this case whilst the simple prodevelopement of magnetical properties in steel and iron c 2 11 cess only occasioned an attractive power capable of lifting between 56 and 88 grains though the wire was repeatedly hammered the compound process augmented the lifting power by 12 blows only up to 186 grains indicating three times the former magnetic energy But on the other hand in experiment No VII the appli cation of the compound process to a very long wire was pro ductive of very little advantage Nor was the compound process of so evident an advantage in the third series of ex periments in this case however the failure of effect was probably occasioned by the very small size of the upper rod I ii in comparison of the magnitude and mass of the lower 2 Another object of enquiry in these investigations was the effect or relation of temper in connection with the degree of magnetic energy developed The result with the first apparatus was conformable to the law of magnetics in ge neral naniely that the softer the temper the more suscep tible the steel becomes of the magnetic condition By a comparison of experiments No I with II V with VI and IX with XII and XIII the advantage of softening the wire is very obvious In the first instance a steel wire in the state in which it was drawn could only be made to lift between 36 and 73 grains but the same wire on being softened readily lifted 186 grains after nine blows on the simple pro cess and after 80 blows by both processes its lifting power was augmented to 326 grains being nearly twice its own weight and at least five times the power it acquired in its untempered state But this difference of susceptibility for receiving the magnetic energy is rendered still more obvious by a comparison of the second set of experiments No V and VI A long wire untempered being struck 20 or 309 Mr SCORESBYS experiments and observations on the smart blows by the simple process only acquired a lifting power of between 7 and 18 grains whilst the same wire after being softened and subjected to a similar treatment lifted 326 grains And in the third set of experiments IX XII and XIII the result was analogous The untempered wire by 5 blows on the simple process lifted only 37 grains and by the same number of blows on the compound process 73s whilst a similar wire tempered lifted after exactly the same treatment i86 grains by the simple process and 265 by the compound process The same result was indeed always obtained in various other experiments not included in the preceding details yet there is one in the third series No XVj which is apparently at variance with this conclusion The difference of effect however the untempered wire in this instance having re ceived an equal power to that of the softened wire of a similar kind was evidently owing to the employment of a very powerful apparatus the large bar of which had become highly magnetic from long continued use in these experiments Hence a greater action upon bars of harder temper was to be expected conformable to what occurs with the use of a powerful apparatus in the ordinary modes of giving inag netism to steel The facility with which magnetism may be developed in softened wires by this process is very striking The first five blows in experiment No II by the simple process pro duced a lifting power of 73 grains nearly onehalf the weight of the wire the first two blows in experiment No VII also by the simple process produced in a long wire whose mag netism had been totally destroyed by heating to redness a lifting power of 186 grains  and the first 5 blows in exdeelopement of magnetical properties in steel and iron c 21 3 periment No XIII on a new wire by the compound process occasioned in this wire of only 145 grains weight a lifting power of 265 grains 3 The increased magnetic energy developed by the use of larger bars of iron a fact indeed which it was reasonable to expect is quite satisfactory in all the comparative experi ments The long wire S t ii by the small apparatus was made to lift between 326 and 389 grains being the highest effect produced on it Experiment No VIIJ  but on applying it to the large apparatus its lifting power was at length aug mented to 662 grains Experiment XVIJ And by the small apparatus the highest power that could be given to the wire S t i was a capability of lifting a weight of 345 grains Ex periments II III IV  but on using the large apparatus the same wire EExperiment XIVJ was eventually made to lift 669 grains being abovefour times its own weight This was the highest effect produced The advantage however of the large apparatus was the most striking in the case of untempered wires An untempered wire S u i had its lifting power by the first apparatus with difficulty raised to nearly 70 grains Experiment I whilst a similar but somewhat shorter wire S u iii was by the use of the large apparatus readily made to lift 246 grains  and by continuing the pro cess on several different days its power was at length increased to 602 grains Experiment XVJ 4 It would appear from experiments IV and XV that in the use of any one apparatus there is a limit to the power which it is capable of developing whereas from the great augmentation of effect obtained by the use of a larger appa ratus it becomes probable that were iron rods sufficiently2  Mr SCORESBYS experiments and observations on the large employed there would be no limit to the attractive force developed in the steel wires until they were magnetised to saturation The quantity of effect produced by an iron bar seems to be in some certain proportion to the amount of its own magnetic energy as indicated by its action on a compass needle but not in the proportion of its lifting power 5 It is a well known fact in magnetics that the capacity of steel for magnetism is increased by timeby repeated re newals of the magnetising process at intervalsand by keep ing the magnet under constraint either by the contact of other magnetic substances or by the use of conductors be tween the opposite poles Hence I expected that a wire magnetised by percussion to a maximum for the time might have its power subsequently increased day after day in con sequence of its capacity being increased by a repetition of the process To a certain extent this was the case but when the iron bars had acquired their maximum energy and the wires were then hammered until there was a decided sus pension of increase of energy no future repetition of the process however laboriously conducted gave me any ad ditional power Experiments No IV and XV3 On the first view of the subject I was at a loss to account for the suspension of the augmentation when I had calculated on an increased capacity for magnetic energy with the con tinuation of the process agreeable to the known laws of mag netics but I eventually perceived that the analogy with the ordinary communication of magnetism was not complete It was evident that the suspension of augmentation did not arise from the want of capacity in the steel for magnetism the wires not being near a state of saturation  but it arose from thedevelopement of magnetical properties in steel and iron c incapability of the iron rods attaining or retaining more mag netic energy The maximum in their conditions it would appear determines the maximum in the condition of the steel But I apprehend had I used very large rods capable of com municating magnetism to the wires above the point of their saturation then the usual analogy would have been com plete and I should progressively have attained higher and higher degrees of polarity As the phaenomenon of the progressive elevation of the point of saturation in magnets became a matter of some thought and consideration with me I may be excused per haps for including here the substance of my reflections on this subject and especially as some change similar to what takes place in magnets having their saturated point raised by renewals of the magnetising operation c also takes place in the disposition of steel bars or wires for polarity by per cussion For as a magnet having its poles reversed will not at first by the same apparatus and process as that from which it originally derived its power acquire the same in tensity as before so in wires magnetised by percussion with the same end always held downward the inversion of the poles will not be accompanied by equal power as before Respecting this phenomenon I may suggest the following explanation The natural condition of iron is without polarity It ac quires polarity by certain modes of treatment or juxtapo sition with magnetic substances  until which it evinces no attractive property In this state its magnetic properties are neutral and there is no tendency in the iron to develope polarity But if it be rendered magnetic no matter by whati6 Mr SCORESBYS experiments and observations on the cause as it is now in a state of constraint or violence there is a tendency to return to the state of neutrality In soft iron the return to its former condition is almost instantaneous on the removal of the disturbing cause but in steel the resto ration to its former state is resisted by a force proportionate to the hardness of its temper Soft steel readily acquires po larity but it is evanescent and hard steel receives polarity with difficulty but it is very permanent Though in all mag netised substances there is a force always acting towards the restoration of the condition of neutrality yet when the mag netism has been highly developed it produces a permanent change in the point where the force ceases to act This point we may call the state of quiescence being the state of a mag netic substance when the different magnetisms though not perfectly neutralised are yet as it were balanced In the natural condition of a substance capable of some permanency of magnetism the neutral and quiescent states are coincident but after every magnetising operation if the denomination of the poles be always preserved the same they are farther and farther removed hence arises an increasing capacity for magnetic energy If for the sake of illustration a piece of steel somewhat soft be magnetised on the removal of the cause provided no artificial means be used to keep it up the polarity will gradually diminish until it comes to the quiescent condition or the state where the resistance natural to the metal has no returning force to oppose Suppose in this state it yet has polarity capable of lifting the weight of an ounce of iron and that in its highest or saturated state of magnetism it lifted 20 ounces On being again magnetised by the same means and process it will now have increaseddevelopement of magnetical properties in steel and iron c x17 its capacity to near 21 ounces By thus continuing the pro cess and using means to retain the magnetism developed the quiescent point may perhaps be raised as high as the original state of saturation that is to a lifting power of 2o ounces when its saturated lifting power will approach to 40 ounces But to effect this it will be necessary to continue the poles always the same for on every inversion of the poles the point of quiescence will return somewhat towards the point of neutrality and the magnetic energy will be pro portionably diminished On the first change of the poles the magnetic energy in a state of saturation will be dimi nished by about the difference of the points of quiescence and neutrality or nearly as much as in experiments with the same poles always preserved the magnetic energy is augmented Thus when in the above example the point of quiescence has a lifting power of 5 ounces capable when magnetised to saturation of being raised to 25 ounces on inversion of the poles it will only have a capacity for 15 ounces These most probably are not the exact powers for it is likely that the augmentation of force vwhich takes place on repeatedly mag netising at certain intervals beyond the point of quiescence may diminish in a geometrical ratio as the point of quiescence recedes from the point of neutrality  otherwise there would be no limit whatever to the power of a magnet The law however not having been determined I have used in the above examples an arithmetical ratio merely for the sake of illustration This doctrine is the same when applied to the develope ment of magnetism by percussion as by any other process and easily explains why on the first trial especially with a MDCCCXXIV F r218 Mr SCORESBYS experiments and observations on the weak apparatus or with bars not perfectly softened such great effects should not be produced as by numerous repe titions of the same process at different times The proof as to the cause being the removal of the point of quiescence from that of neutrality is I think quite conclusive For in an experiment one among many to the same effect made with the wire S t i I found that when 5 blows with a hammer on the compound process with the north end of the wire downward commencing when the attractive force was al most totally destroyed gave it a lifting power of 326 grains the same nnmber of blows with the south end down also commencing when the attractive force was very nearly neu tralised gave it only a lifting power of 2 grains In short I have raised the point of quiescence so high above the point of neutrality that a long and severe hammering south end of the wire downward only destroyed the original attractive force but did not produce inversion of poles 6 The foundation of this process for the developement of magnetism in steel is the employment of such magnetism of large rods of iron as can be derived from juxtaposition of the great magnet the earth And the high effects produced seem to depend on the disposition which percussion gives to the ferruginous particles for assuming that condition to which we give the name of magnetic The iron rod employed as soon as placed in a vertical position or in the direction of the dipping needle acquires polarity from the earth but the natural resistance of its particles to the state of constraint which it must be in when magnetic prevents its receiving the full power that the earth is disposed to communicate Percussion by producing a vibration among the particles ofdevelopement of magnetical properties in steel and iron c 219 the metal seems to overcome this resistance and at the same time disposes the iron for the retention of the mag netism acquired Now on placing a wire or bar of soft steel upon this rod of iron its magnetic virtue occasions some developement of the same power in the steel which is increased by the tendency that percussion has to aid its developement in the steel the same as it previously elicited in the iron By continuing this treatment the polarity of the steel is progressively augmented until it has acquired a max imum depending not so much on its own capacity for mag netism as on the capability of the iron to develope it But this condition it has been shown is only a maximum so long as the same iron bar or bars are used and so long as their mag netic energy obtains no augmentation for if by any means their polarity be increased the attractive force of the steel wires will rise in proportion From the whole phaenomena viewed in connection it seems that the simple general fact is this that percussion applied to magnetisable substances in contact with one another disposes them to an equality of condition If this view of the subject be correct we have a satisfactory explanation of some of the phenomena which were other wise obscure We see why large bars or wires of steel though they acquire a greater quantity of magnetic energy as shown by their higher action on a compass needle than small ones do not attain any higher lifting powers than much smaller wires Coinpare Experiments III with VII and XIV with XVI And above all we have an explanation of the apparently contradictory propositions that percus sion diminishes and has a tendency to destroy the energy of20 Mr SCORESBYs experiments and observations on the magnets and that percussion has a tendency to develope polarity in iron and steel not previously magnetic Both these propositions are undoubtedly true but they are under different conditions Percussion whilst it diminishes the energy of a magnet when held alone or even upon an iron bar would probably augment its energy if it were placed with consistent poles in contact with a more powerful magnet which is the condition of wires magnetised by percussion  because if they be hammered upon a substance not mag netic little or no energy is developed See Experiment No X These different effects would appear to be the necessary result of a tendency to equality of conditiona tendency which is precisely similar in respect to bodies of unequal temperatures when placed in contact or even in juxtaposition For as a hot body placed near or among cold substances of greater mass and capacity than itself has its temperature brought down nearly to the state of the colder substances whilst a cold body has its temperature raised by contact with hot substances in like manner a strong magnet hammered upon an iron rod has its energy brought down towards the condition of the iron and a bar not magnetic or slightly so hammered upon the same rod has polarity developed in it and raised progressively up to the condition of the iron As I apprehend it would be in vain to attempt to produce such strong magnetic effects as we derive from percussion by the simple use of the same bars and apparatus in any of the known modes of touching it becomes probable that this process might be applied in connection with other modes of magnetising for giving increased power to magnets Thedevelopement of magnetical properties in steel and iron c 2 21 extraordinary power of KNIGHTS magnets are well known though the secret of their manufacture died with him and no effect at all comparable has I believe been since produced Is it not probable that he may have employed a process of this description   I am indebted for this thought to a suggestion of Sir H DAVYs in a conver sation on these experiments W S Junro On board the ship Baffin off Iceland August 27 i823z

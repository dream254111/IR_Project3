J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106660,ON THE CONVERSION OF A MIXTURE OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AND PHLOGISTICATED AIR INTO NITROUS ACID BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK BY HENRY CAVENDISH ESQ F R S AND A S,I206940,261 XVII ON THE CONVERSION OF A MIXTURE OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AND PHLOGISTICATED AIR INTO NITROUS ACID BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK BY HENRY CAVENDISH ESQ F R S AND A S READ APRIL 17 1788 IN VOLUME LXXV OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS P 372 I RELATED AN EXPERIMENT WHICH SHEWED THAT BY PASSING REPEATED ELECTRIC SPARKS THROUGH A MIXTURE OF ATMO SPHERIC AND DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR CONFINED IN A BENT GLASS TUBE BY COLUMNS OF SOAPLEES AND QUICKSILVER THE AIR WAS CONVERTED INTO NITROUS ACID WHICH UNITED TO THE SOAPLEES AND FORMED NITRE BUT AS THIS EXPERIMENT HAS SINCE BEEN TRIED BY SOME PER SONS OF DISTINGUISHED ABILITY IN SUCH PURSUITS WITHOUT SUCCESS I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO TAKE SOME MEASURES TO AUTHENTICATE THE TRUTH OF IT FOR THIS PURPOSE I REQUESTED MR GILPIN CLERK OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY TO REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT AND DESIRED SOME OF THE GENTLEMEN MOST CONVERSANT WITH THESE SUBJECTS TO BE PRESENT AT PUTTING THE MATERIALS TOGETHER AND AT THE EXA MINATION OF THE PRODUCE THIS LABORIOUS EXPERIMENT MR GILPIN WAS SO GOOD AS TO UNDERTAKE IT WAS PERFORMED IN THE SAME MANNER AND WITH THE SAME APPARATUS WHICH WAS USED IN MY OWN EXPERIMENTS AND WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE ABOVEMEN TIONED PAPER AND IS ACCOMPANIED WITH A DRAWING THE N N 2 METHOD262 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON THE METHOD USED FOR INTRODUCING AIR INTO THE BENT TUBE WAS THAT DESCRIBED IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF P 373 IN THAT PAPER BY MEANS OF THE APPARATUS REPRESENTED IN FIG 3 OR THE RESERVOIR AS I SHALL CALL IT THE SOAPLEES LIKE THOSE OF MY OWN EXPERIMENTS WERE PREPARED FROM SALT OF TARTAR AND WERE OF SUCH STRENGTH AS TO YIELD 110 OF THEIR WEIGHT OF NITRE WHEN SATURATED WITH NITROUS ACID THE DEPHLO GISTICATED AIR WAS PREPARED FROM TURBITH MINERAL AND SEEMED BY THE NITROUS TEST TO CONTAIN ABOUT 118 PART OF PHLOGISTICATED AIR ON DECEMBER 6 1787 IN THE PRESENCE OF SIR JOSEPH BANKS DR BLAGDEN DR DOLLFUSS DR FORDYCE DR J HUNTER AND MR MACIE THE MATERIALS WERE PUT TOGE THER THE QUANTITY OF SOAPLEES INTRODUCED INTO THE BENT TUBE WAS 180 MEASURES EACH OF WHICH CONTAINED ONE GRAIN OF QUICKSILVER AND AS THE BORE OF THE TUBE WAS RATHER MORE THAN ONETHIRD OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER IT FORMED A COLUMN OF FIVE OR SIXTENTHS OF AN INCH IN LENGTH WHICH BY THE INTRO DUCTION OF THE AIR WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS ONE RESTING ON THE QUICKSILVER IN ONE LEG OF THE TUBE AND THE OTHER ON THAT IN THE OTHER LEG THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR WAS MIXED WITH ONE THIRD PART OF ITS BULK OF ATMOSPHERIC AIR OF THE ROOM IN A SEPA RATE JAR AND THE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED WITH THE MIXTURE AND FROM THENCE MR GILPIN AS OCCASION REQUIRED FORCED AIR INTO THE BENT TUBE TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THAT ABSORBED BY MEANS OF THE ELECTRIC SPARK FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IT APPEARS THAT THE MIXTURE EM PLOYED CONTAINED A LESS PROPORTION OF COMMON AIR THAN THAT USED IN EITHER OF MY EXPERIMENTS THIS MADE IT NECESSARY FOR MR GILPIN NOW AND THEN TO INTRODUCE SOME COMMON AIR BY 4 MEANSPHILOS TRANS VOL

WHENEVER FROM THE SLOWNESS OF THE ABSORP TION HE THOUGHT THERE WAS TOO SMALL A PROPORTION OF PHLOGISTI CATED AIR IN THE TUBE MY REASON FOR THIS MANNER OF PROCEEDING WAS THAT AS MY FIRST EXPERIMENT SEEMED TO SHEW THAT THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR OUGHT TO BE IN A RATHER GREATER PROPORTION TO THE PHLOGISTICATED THAN THE LATTER DID I WAS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN AS TO THE PRO PER QUANTITIES AND DOUBTED WHETHER I COULD PROPORTION THEM IN SUCH MANNER AS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY DURING THE COURSE OF THE EXPERIMENT TO ADD EITHER DEPHLOGISTICATED OR COMMON AIR I THEREFORE MIXED THE AIRS IN SUCH PROPORTION THAT I WAS SURE THERE COULD BE NO OCCASION TO ADD THE FORMER SINCE IT WAS MUCH EASIER AS WELL AS MORE UNEXCEPTIONABLE TO ADD COMMON AIR THAN DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR ON DECEMBER 24 AS THE AIR IN THE RESERVOIR WAS ALMOST ALL USED THIS APPARATUS WAS AGAIN FILLED IN THE PRESENCE OF MOST OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED GENTLEMEN WITH A MIXTURE OF THE SAME DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR AND COMMON AIR IN THE SAME PROPORTIONS AS BEFORE AND THE SAME THING WAS REPEATED ON JANUARY 19 ON JANUARY 23 THE BENT TUBE WAS BY ACCIDENT RAISED OUT OF ONE OF THE GLASSES OF MERCURY INTO WHICH IT WAS INVERTED BY WHICH IT WAS FILLED WITH AIR AND A GOOD DEAL OF THE SOAPLEES WERE LOST THERE HOWEVER WAS ENOUGH REMAINING FOR EXAMI NATION ON JANUARY 28 AND 29 THE PRODUCE OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS EXAMINED IN THE PRESENCE OF SIR JOSEPH BANKS DR BLAGDEN DR DOLLFUSS DR FORDYCE DR HEBERDEN DR J HUNTER MR MACIE AND DR WATSON IT APPEARED THAT 9290 MEASURES OF THE MIXED AIR HAD BEEN FORCED INTO THE BENT264 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON THE BENT TUBE FROM THE RESERVOIR BESIDES THIS MR GILPIN HAD AT DIFFERENT TIMES INTRODUCED 872 MEASURES OF COMMON AIR WHICH MAKES IN ALL 10162 OF AIR CONSISTING OF 6968 OF DE PHLOGISTICATED AIR AND 3194 OF COMMON AIR BUT AS THERE WERE 900 MEASURES OF AIR REMAINING IN THE TUBE WHEN THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED THE QUANTITY ABSORBED WAS ONLY 9262 BUT THIS IS A MUCH GREATER QUANTITY THAT WHAT FROM MY OWN EXPE RIMENTS SEEMED NECESSARY FOR THIS QUANTITY OF SOAPLEES THE SOAPLEES WERE POURED INTO A SMALL GLASS CUP AND THE TUBE WASHED WITH A LITTLE DISTILLED WATER IN ORDER THAT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE MIGHT BE LOST AS THEY WERE BY THIS MEANS CONSI DERABLY DILUTED THEY WERE EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE QUANTITY OF THE SALINE RESIDUUM AS IT WAS MIXED WITH A FEW PARTICLES OF MERCURY SOME VITRIOLIC ACID DROPPED ON A LITTLE OF THIS RESIDUUM YIELDED A SMELL OF NITROUS ACID THE SAME AS WHEN DROPPED ON NITRE PHLOGISTICATED BY EXPOSURE TO THE FIRE IN A COVERED CRUCI BLE BUT IT WAS THOUGHT LESS STRONG THE REMAINDER WAS DIS SOLVED IN A SMALL QUANTITY OF DISTILLED WATER AND THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS WERE TRIED WITH THE SOLUTION IT DID NOT AT ALL DISCOLOUR PAPER TINGED WITH THE JUICE OF BLUE FLOWERS IT LEFT A NAUSEOUS TASTE IN THE MOUTH LIKE SOLUTIONS OF MER CURY AND MOST OTHER METALLIC SUBSTANCES PAPER DIPPED INTO IT AND DRIED BURNT WITH SOME APPEARANCE OF DEFLAGRATION BUT NOT SO STRONGLY OR UNIFORMLY AS WHEN DIPPED IN A SOLUTION OF NITRE THE MARKS OF DEFLAGRATION HOWEVER WERE STRONGER THAN WHEN THE PAPER WAS DIPPED INTO A SOLUTION  THE METHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE QUANTITY OF AIR FORCED IN WAS BY WEIGHING THE RESERVOIR AS MENTIONED IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED PAPER P 374 OFFORMATION OF NITROUS  265 OF MERCURY IN SPIRIT OF NITRE BUT NOT SO STRONG AS WHEN EQUAL PARTS OF THIS SOLUTION AND SOLUTION OF NITRE WERE USED A SOLUTION OF FIXED VEGETABLE ALKALI DROPPED INTO SOME OF IT DILUTED PRODUCED A SLIGHT REDDISHBROWN PRECIPITATE WHICH AFTERWARDS ASSUMED A GREENISH COLOUR A BIT OF BRIGHT COPPER BEING DIPPED INTO IT ACQUIRED AN EVIDENT WHITISH COLOUR THOUGH NOT SO WHITE AS WHEN DIPPED INTO THE SOLUTION OF MERCURY IN SPIRIT OF NITRE FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS IT APPEARS THAT THE MIXTURE OF THE TWO AIRS WAS ACTUALLY CONVERTED INTO NITROUS ACID ONLY THE EXPERI MENT WAS CONTINUED TOO LONG SO THAT THE QUANTITY OF AIR ABSORBED WAS GREATER THAN IN MY EXPERIMENTS AND THE ACID PRODUCED WAS SUFFICIENT NOT ONLY TO SATURATE THE SOAPLEES BUT ALSO TO DISSOLVE SOME OF THE MERCURY THE TRUTH OF THE LATTER PART IS PROVED BY THE METALLIC TASTE OF THE RESIDUUM ITS NOT DISCOLOUR ING THE BLUE PAPER THE PRECIPITATE FORMED BY THE ADDITION OF FIXED ALKALI AND THE WHITE COLOUR GIVEN TO THE COPPER AND THE NITROUS FUMES PRODUCED BY THE ADDITION OF OIL OF VITRIOL AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH PAPER IMPREGNATED WITH THE RESIDUUM BURNT SHEW AS PLAINLY THAT THE ACID PRODUCED WAS OF THE NITROUS KIND IT IS REMARKABLE HOWEVER THAT DURING THIS EXPERI MENT THERE WERE NO SIGNS WHICH SHEWED WHEN THE SOAPLEES BECAME SATURATED THE ONLY TIME WHEN THE DIMINUTION PROCEEDED MUCH SLOWER THAN USUAL WAS ON JANUARY 4 IT THEN SEEMED TO GO ON VERY SLOWLY BUT AS THE AIR ABSORBED AT THAT TIME WAS ONLY 4830 MEASURES WHICH IS MUCH LESS THAN WHAT SEEMS RE QUISITE TO SATURATE THE ALKALI AND AS THE DIMINUTION IMME DIATELY WENT ON AGAIN UPON ADDING MORE COMMON AIR IT SEEMS NOT LIKELY THAT THE SOAPLEES WERE SATURATED AT THAT TIME ON JANUARY 10 MR GILPIN OBSERVED A SMALL QUANITY OF WHITISH SEDIMENT ON THE SURFACE OF THE MERCURY WHICH SEEMS TO266 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON THE TO SHEW THAT THE SOAPLEES WERE THEN SATURATED AND THAT THE ACID WAS BEGINNING TO CORRODE THE MERCURY THE QUANTITY OF AIR ABSORBED WAS ALSO 6840 MEASURES WHICH IS ABOUT AS MUCH AS I EXPECTED WOULD BE REQUIRED HOWEVER AS I WAS PERSUADED FROM THE EVENT OF MY OWN EXPERIMENTS THAT THE DIMINUTION WOULD EITHER INTIRELY CEASE OR GO ON VERY SLOWLY AS SOON AS THE SOAPLEES WERE SATURATED AND AS I WAS UNWILLING TO STOP THE EXPERIMENTS BEFORE THAT HAPPENED I THOUGHT IT BEST TO CON TINUE THE ELECTRIFICATION ON THE SAME MORNING MR GILPIN FOUND THAT ABOUT 120 MEASURES OF THE AIR IN THE BENT TUBE HAD BEEN SPONTANEOUSLY ABSORBED DURING THE NIGHT THE QUANTITY THEREIN BEING SO MUCH LESS THAN IT WAS THE PRECEDING EVENING THOUGH THE ELECTRICAL MACHINE HAD NOT BEEN WORKED OR ANY THING DONE TO IT DURING THE INTERMEDIATE TIME THE REASON OF THIS IN ALL PROBABILITY IS THAT AS THE ACID WAS THEN CORRODING THE MERCURY THE SOAP LEES BECAME IMPREGNATED WITH NITROUS AIR WHICH DURING THE NIGHT UNITED TO THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR AND CAUSED THE DIMI NUTION THOUGH IN REALITY THE EVENT OF THIS EXPERIMENT WAS SUCH AS TO ESTABLISH THE TRUTH OF MY POSITION THAT THE MIXTURE OF DE PHLOGISTICATED AND PHLOGISTICATED AIR IS CONVERTED BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK INTO NITROUS ACID AS FULLY AS IF THE EXPERIMENT HAD BEEN STOPPED IN PROPER TIME YET AS THE EVENT WAS IN SOME MEA SURE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF MY OWN EXPERIMENTS AND MIGHT AFFORD ROOM FOR CAVIL I WAS DESIROUS OF HAVING IT REPEATED AND AS MR GILPIN WAS SO OBLIGING AS TO UNDERTAKE IT AGAIN THE MATERIALS WERE ON FEBRUARY 11 PUT TOGETHER FOR A FRESH EXPERIMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF MOST OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED GEN TLEMEN THE SOAP LEES EMPLOYED WERE THE SAME AS BEFORE BUT 183 MEASURES WERE NOW INTRODUCED THE DEPHLOGISTCATED AIR WAS DIFFERENTFORMATION OF NITROUS ACID 267 DIFFERENT THE FORMER PARCEL BEING ALL USED IT WAS PREPARED LIKE THE FORMER FROM TURBITH MINERAL BUT WAS RATHER PURER AS IT SEEMED TO CONTAIN ONLY 132 OF PHLOGISTICATED AIR THE PROPORTION IN WHICH IT WAS MIXED WITH COMMON AIR WAS THAT OF 22 TO 10 SO THAT A GREATER PROPORTION OF COMMON AIR WAS NOW USED IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH IT WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR MR GILPIN TO INTRODUCE COMMON AIR SO OFTEN ON FEBRUARY 29 THE RESERVOIR WAS AGAIN FILLED WITH AIR OF THE SAME KIND IN PRESENCE OF SOME OF THE SAME GENTLEMEN AS IT WAS FOUND BY THE LAST EXPERIMENT THAT WE MUST NOT DE PEND ON THE SATURATION OF THE SOAPLEES BEING MADE KNOWN BY ANY ALTERATION IN THE RATE OF DIMINUTION THE PROCESS WAS STOPPED AS SOON AS THE AIR ABSORBED WAS SUCH AS FROM MY OWN EXPERIMENTS I JUDGED SUFFICIENT TO NEUTRALIZE THE SOAPLEES THIS WAS EFFECTED ON THE 15TH OF MARCH THE AIR REMAINING IN THE TUBE WHEN MR GILPIN LEFT OFF WORKING WAS 600 MEASURES BUT AT THE TIME THE PRODUCE WAS EXAMINED IT WAS REDUCED TO ABOUT 120 SO MUCH HAVING BEEN ABSORBED WITHOUT THE HELP OF ANY ELECTRIFICATION WHICH IS A STILL MORE REMARKA BLE INSTANCE OF SPONTANEOUS ABSORPTION THAN WHAT OCCURRED IN THE FORMER EXPERIMENT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE EXPERIMENT BE GAN A BLACK FILM WAS FORMED IN ONE OF THE LEGS WHICH I SUPPOSE MUST HAVE BEEN A MERCURIAL ETHIOPS BUT WHETHER OWING TO SOME SMALL DEGREE OF FOULNESS IN THE MERCURY OR TUBE OR TO ANY OTHER CAUSE I CANNOT TELL THIS FOULNESS SEEMED NOT TO INCREASE BUT ON MARCH 10 WHEN THE AIR ABSORBED WAS ABOUT 5200 A WHITISH SEDIMENT BEGAN TO APPEAR ON THE SURFACE OF THE MERCURY ON MARCH 19 THE PRODUCE WAS EXAMINED IN THE PRESENCE OF DR BLAGDEN DR DOLLFUSS DR FORDYCE DR HEBER DEN DR J HUNTER MR MACIE AND DR WATSON V O L LXXVIII O O THE268 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON THE THE MIXED AIR FORCED INTO THE BENT TUBE FROM THE RESERVOIR WAS 6650 MEASURES BESIDES WHICH MR GILPIN HAD AT DIFFERENT TIMES INTRODUCED 630 OF COMMON AIR WHICH MAKES IN ALL 7280 CONTAINING 4570 OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AND 2710 OF COM MON AIR THE SOAPLEES WERE EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS AS BEFORE THE RESIDUUM WEIGHED TWO GRAINS BUT THERE WERE TWO OR THREE GLO BULES OF MERCURY MIXED WITH IT WHICH MIGHT VERY LIKELY WEIGH HALF A GRAIN THIS BEING DISSOLVED IN A SMALL QUANTITY OF WATER THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE WITH IT IT DID NOT AT ALL DISCOLOUR PAPER TINGED WITH BLUE FLOWERS SLIPS OF PAPER WERE DIPPED INTO IT AND DIRED AND BY WAY OF COMPARISON OTHER SLIPS OF PAPER WERE DIPPED INTO A SOLU TION BOTH OF COMMON NITRE AND PHLOGISTICATED NITRE AND ALSO DRIED THE FORMER BURNT IN THE SAME MANNER AND WITH AS STRONG MARKS OF DEFLAGRATION AS THE LATTER IT HAD A STRONG TASTE OF NITRE BUT LEFT ALSO A SLIGHT METALLIC TASTE ON THE TONGUE IT DID NOT GIVE ANY WHITE COLOUR TO A PIECE OF CLEAN COPPER PUT INTO IT IN ORDER TO SEE WHETHER THE WHITISH SEDIMENT WHICH WAS BEFORE SAID TO BE FORMED IN THE BENT TUBE CONTAINED ANY MER CURY THE REMAINDER OF THIS SOLUTION WAS DILUTED WITH SOME MORE DISTILLED WATER AND SUFFERED TO STAND TILL THE WHITE SEDI MENT HAD SUBSIDED THE CLEAR LIQUOR BEING THEN POURED OFF THE REMAINDER CONTAINING THE SEDIMENT WHICH SEEMED TO AMOUNT ONLY TO A VERY SMALL QUANTITY WAS PUT ON A PIECE OF BRIGHT COPPER AND DRIED UPON IT A PIECE OF CLEAN GOLD WAS THEN LAID OVER IT AND BOTH WERE EXPOSED TO HEAT BOTH METALS ACQUIRED A WHITISH COLOUR ESPECIALLY THE GOLD BUT WHICH WAS VERY INDETERMINATE 5 INPHILOSTRANSVOLLXXVIII TAB IVP268 N T O G S B H FIG 1 J C L V P N F K M Q R A B I O FIG 2 Y D C V E F P N Q R I L X S G HFORMATION OF NITROUS ACID 269 IN ORDER TO DISCOVER HOW NICE A TEST OF ALCALINITY THE PAPER TINGED WITH BLUE FLOWERS WAS A SATURATED SOLUTION OF COM MON NITRE WAS MIXED WITH 1120 OF ITS BULK OF THE SOAPLEES AND THIS MIXTURE WAS FOUND TO TURN THE PAPER EVIDENTLY GREEN SO THAT AS THE SOLUTION OF NITRE CONTAINS ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH ALKALI AS THE SOAPLEES IT APPEARS THAT IF THE RESIDUUM HAD WANTED ONLY 1240 PART OF BEING SATURATED IT WOULD HAVE DISCO LOURED THE PAPER FROM THE FOREGOING TRIALS IT APPEARS THAT THE MIXTURE OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AND COMMON AIR IN THIS EXPERIMENT WAS ACTUALLY CONVERTED INTO NITROUS ACID AND WAS SUFFICIENT NOT ONLY TO SA TURATE THE SOAPLEES BUT ALSO TO DISSOLVE SOME OF THE MERCURY THE QUANTITY DISSOLVED HOWEVER WAS VERY SMALL AND NOT SUF FICIENT TO DIMINISH SENSIBLY THE DEFLAGRATING QUALITY OF THE NI TRE SO THAT THE PROOF OF THE AIR BEING CONVERTED INTO NI TROUS ACID WAS AS EVIDENT AS IF NO MERCURY HAD BEEN DISSOLVED IN THIS EXPERIMENT AS WELL AS THE FORMER NO INDICATION OF THE SOAPLEES BECOMING SATURATED WAS AFFORDED BY ANY CESSATION IN THE DIMINUTION OF THE AIR WHEREAS IN MY EXPERIMENTS IT WAS VERY MANIFEST I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THIS DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE OWING TO EXCEPT TO MR GILPINS GIVING MUCH STRONGER ELECTRICAL SPARKS THAN I DID IN HIS EXPERIMENTS THE METALLIC KNOB WHICH RECEIVED THE SPARK AND CONVEYED IT TO THE BENT TUBE WAS USUALLY PLACED AT ABOUT 212 INCHES FROM THE CON DUCTOR SO THAT THE SPARK JUMPED THROUGH 212 INCHES OF AIR IN PASSING FROM THE CONDUCTOR TO THE KNOB BESIDES FROM 112 TO 212 INCHES OF AIR IN THE TUBE WHEREAS IN MY EXPERIMENTS I BE LIEVE THE KNOB WAS NEVER PLACED AT THE DISTANCE OF MORE THAN 114 INCH FROM THE CONDUCTOR AND THE QUANTITY OF AIR IN THE TUBE WAS MUCH LESS BUT THE CONDUCTOR AND ELECTRICAL MACHINE WERE THE SAME O O 2 EXCEPT270 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON THE EXCEPT THIS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I KNOW IN THE MANNER OF CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENT IS FIRST THAT MR GILPIN USUALLY CONTINUED WORKING THE MACHINE FOR HALF AN HOUR AT A TIME WHEREAS I SELDOM WORKED IT MORE THAN TEN MINUTES AND SE CONDLY THAT IN MR GILPINS EXPERIMENTS THE COMMON AIR IN THE RESERVOIR BORE A LESS PROPOTION TO THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR THAN IN MINE IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HIM FREQUENTLY TO INTRODUCE COMMON AIR ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PROPORTION OF THE TWO AIRS IN THE BENT TUBE WOULD BE CONSI DERABLY DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES BUT ON THE WHOLE THE COMMON AIR ABSORBED BORE A GREATER PROPORTION TO THE DEPHLO GISTICATED THAN IN MINE THOUGH THE WHOLE QUANTITY OF AIR ABSORBED IN THESE EX PERIMETNS IS KNOWN WITH CONSIDERABLE PRECISION YET IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WITH ANY ACCURACY HOW MUCH OF EACH KIND WAS ABSORBED ON ACCOUNT OF OUR UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE AIR WHICH REMAINED AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT BUT IF IN THE LAST EXPERIMENT WE SUPPOSE THAT THE AIR ABSORBED SPONTANEOUSLY BETWEEN THE 15TH AND 19TH OF MARCH WAS INTIRELY DEPHLOGISTICATED AND THAT WHAT REMAINED AT THE END OF THAT TIME WAS OF THE PURITY OF COM MON AIR IT WILL APPEAR THAT 4090 OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AND 2588 OF COMMON AIR WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO 4480 OF PURE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR AND 2198 OF PHLOGISTICATED AIR WERE AB SORBED AT THE TIME THE ELECTRIFICATION WAS STOPPED AND CONSE QUENTLY THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR IS 204100 OF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR WHEREAS IN MY FIRST EXPERIMENT IT SEEMED TO BE 220100 AND IN MY LAST 253100 BUT THE QUANTITY OF ACID PRODUCED AND CONSEQUENTLY I SUP POSE THE SATURATION OF THE SOAPLEES DEPENDS ONLY ON THE QUAN TITY OF PHLOGISTICATED AIR ABSORBED AND THE EFFECT OF THE GREATER OR LESS QUANTITY OF DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR IS ONLY TO MAKE THE NITREFORMATION OF NITROUS ACID 271 NITRE PRODUCED MORE OR LESS PHLOGISTICATED NOW IN THIS EXPE RIMENT THE BULK OF THE PHLOGISTICATED AIR WAS 12210 THAT OF THE SOAPLEES IN MY FIRST EXPERIMENT IT WAS 11910 AND IN MY LAST 10810 AS MANY PERSONS SEEM TO HAVE SUPPOSED THAT THE DIMINUTION OF THE AIR IN THESE EXPERIMENTS IS MUCH QUICKER THAN IT REALLY IS THOUGH I DO NOT KNOW ANY THING IN MY PAPER WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO SUPPOSE THAT IT WAS NOT VERY SLOW IT MAY BE PROPER TO SAY SOMETHING ON THIS HEAD AS THE QUICKNESS OF THE DIMINU TION DEPENDS SO MUCH ON THE POWER OF THE ELECTRICAL MACHINE I CAN ONLY SPEAK AS TO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE MACHINE USED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS THIS WAS ONE OF MR NAIRNES PATENT MACHINES THE CYLINDER OF WHICH IS 1212 INCHES LONG AND 7 IN DIAMETER A CONDUCTOR OF 5 FEET LONG AND 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER WAS ADAPTED TO IT AND THE BALL WHICH RECEIVED THE SPARK WAS PLACED AT TWO OR THREE INCHES FROM ANOTHER BALL FIXED TO THE END OF THE CONDUCTOR NOW WHEN THE MACHINE WORKED WELL MR GILPIN SUPPOSES HE GOT ABOUT TWO OR THREE HUNDRED SPARKS A MINUTE AND THE DIMINUTION OF THE AIR DURING THE HALF HOUR WHICH HE CONTINUED WORKING AT A TIME VARIED IN GENERAL FROM 40 TO 120 MEASURES BUT WAS USUALLY GREATEST WHEN THERE WAS MOST AIR IN THE TUBE PROVIDED THE QUANTITY WAS NOT SO GREAT AS TO PREVENT THE SPARK FROM PASSING READILY THE ONLY PERSONS I KNOW OF WHO HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO RE PEAT THIS EXPERIMENT ARE M VAN MARUM ASSISTED BY M PAETS VAN TROOTSWYK M LAVOISIER IN CONJUNCTION WITH M HASSENFRATZ AND M MONGE I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE METHOD WHICH THE THREE LATTER GENTLEMEN EMPLOYED AND AM AT A LOSS TO CONCEIVE WHAT COULD PREVENT SUCH ABLE PHI LOSOPHERS FROM SUCCEEDING EXCEPT WANT OF PATIENCE BUT M VAN MARUM IN HIS PREMIERE CONTINUATION DES EXPERIENCES FAITES272 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS ON THE FAITES PAR LE MOYEN DE LA MACHINE ELECTRIQUE TEYLERIENNE P 182 HAS DESCRIBED THE METHOD EMPLOYED BY HIM AND M VAN TROOTS WYK THEY USED A GLASS TUBE THE UPPER END OF WHICH WAS STOPPED BY CORK THROUGH WHICH AN IRON WIRE WAS PASSED AND SE CURED BY CEMENT AND THE LOWER END WAS IMMERSED INTO MERCURY SO THAT THE ELECTRIC SPARK PASSED FROM THE IRON WIRE TO THE SOAP LEES AFTER SO MUCH OF A MIXTURE OF FIVE PARTS OF DEPHLOGISTI CATED AND THREE OF COMMON AIR AS WAS EQUAL TO TWENTYONE TIMES THE BULK OF THE SOAPLEES  WAS ABSORBED SOME PAPER WAS MOISTENED WITH THE ALKALI WHICH BY ITS BURNING APPEARED TO CONTAIN NITRE BUT SHEWED THAT THE ALKALI WAS NOT NEAR SATU RATED THE EXPERIMENT WAS THEN CONTINUED WITH THE SAME SOAPLEES TILL MORE OF THE AIR EQUAL TO FIFTYSIX TIMES THE BULK OF THE SOAPLEES WAS ABSORBED WHICH IS NEAR DOUBLE THE QUAN TITY REQUIRED TO SATURATE THEM BUT YET THE DIMINUTION WENT ON AS FAST AS EVER IT WAS THEN TRIED BY THE BURNING OF PAPER DIPPED INTO THEM HOW NEARLY THEY WERE SATURATED BUT THEY STILL SEEMED FAR FROM BEING SO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF USING THE IRON WIRE APPEARS EVIDENTLY OBJECTIONABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE DANGER OF THE IRON WIRE BEING CALCINED BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK AND ABSORBING THE DEPHLOGISTI CATED AIR AND WHEN I FIRST READ THE ACCOUNT I THOUGHT THIS THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULT OF OUR EXPERIMENTS BUT I AM NOW INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE CASE WAS OTHERWISE FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH M VAN MARUM EXPRESSES HIMSELF IT SEEMS THAT THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE FROM WHICH THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE ALKALI WAS NOT SATURATED WAS THE IMPERFECT MARKS OF DEFLAGRATION THAT THE PAPER DIPPED INTO IT EXHIBITED IN BURNING WHICH AS WE HAVE SEEN MIGHT PRO CEED AS WELL FROM SOME OF THE MERCURY HAVING BEEN DISSOLVED  THIS IS RATHER MORE THAN HALF OF THAT REQUISITE TO SATURATE THE SOAPLEES ASFORMATION OF NITROUS ACID 273 AS FROM THE ALKALI NOT BEING SATURATED I AM MUCH INCLINED TO THINK THEREFORE THAT SO FAR FROM THE SOAPLEES NOT HAVING BEEN SATURATED THE QUANTITY OF ACID PRODUCED WAS IN REALITY MUCH MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR THIS PURPOSE AND HAD DISSOLVED A GOOD DEAL OF THE MERCURY FOR THE QUANTITY OF AIR ABSORBED FAVOURS THIS OPINION AND THE PHAENOMENA AGREE WELL WITH MR GILPINS FIRST EXPERIMENT IN WHICH THIS WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE WHEREAS IF THE DIMINUTION HAD PROCEEDED CHIEFLY FROM THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR BEING ABSORBED BY THE IRON THE TUBE TOWARDS THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN FILLED CHIEFLY WITH PHLOGISTICATED AIR WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE DIMINUTION PROCEED MUCH FLOWER THAN BEFORE BUT WE ARE TOLD THAT IT WENT ON AS FAST AS EVER IT IS MOST LIKELY THEREFORE THAT THE APPARENT DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THEIR EXPERIMENT AND MINE PROCEEDED ONLY FROM THEIR HAVING CONTINUED THE PROCESS TOO LONG AND FROM THEIR NOT HAVING PROPERLY EXAMINED THE PRODUCE M VAN MARUM THEN PROCEEDS TO SAY  SURPRIS DE CETTE  DIFFERENCE DE RESULTAT JENVOYAI UNE

V A N M A R U M  S I R  I RECEIVED THE HONOUR OF YOUR LETTER IN WHICH YOU INFORM  ME OF YOUR ILL SUCCESS IN TRYING MY EXPERIMENT ON THE CON DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR INSTEAD OF THAT PREPARED FROM DR PRIESTLEYS BLACK POW DER CAN IN THE LEAST DEGREE FORM AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE AS IN THE SAME PARA GRAPH IN WHICH I MENTION MY HAVING USED THIS KIND OF AIR IN MY FIRST EXPERI MENT I SAY THAT IN MY SECOND EXPERIMENT I USED AIR PREPARED FROM TURBITH MINERAL  VERSIONFORMATION OF NITROUS ACID 275  VERSION OF AIR INTO NITROUS ACID BY THE ELECTRIC SPARK IT IS  VERY DIFFICULT TO GUESS WHY AN EXPERIMENT DOES NOT SUCCEED  UNLESS ONE IS PRESENT AND SEES IT TRIED BUT IF YOU INTEND TO  REPEAT THE EXPERIMENT YOUR BEST WAY WILL BE TO TRY IT WITH  THE SAME KIND OF APPARATUS THAT I DESCRIBED IN THAT PAPER  IF YOU DO SO AND OBSERVE THE PRECAUTIONS THERE MENTIONED I  FLATTER MYSELF YOU WILL FIND IT SUCCEED THE APPARATUS YOU  USED SEEMS OBJECTIONABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE DANGER OF THE  IRON BEING CORRODED BY ABSORBING THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR  AS TO THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR PROCURED FROM THE BLACK  POWDER FORMED BY AGITATING MERCURY MIXED WITH LEAD AS  IT WAS FOREIGN TO THE SUBJECT OF THE PAPER AND AS I PROPOSED  TO SPEAK OF IT IN ANOTHER PLACE I DID NOT DESCRIBE MY ME  THOD OF PROCURING IT AS FAR AS I CAN PERCEIVE THE SUCCESS  DEPENDS INTIRELY ON CAREFULLY AVOIDING EVERY THING BY WHICH  THE POWDER CAN ABSORB FIXED AIR OR BECOME MIXED WITH PAR  TICLES OF AN ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE NATURE OR ANY OTHER INFLAM  MABLE MATTER FOR WHICH REASON CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN NOT TO  CHANGE THE AIR IN THE BOTTLE IN WHICH THE MERCURY IS SHAKEN  BY BREATHING INTO IT AS DR PRIESTLEY DID OR EVEN BY  BLOWING INTO IT WITH A BELLOWS AS THEREBY SOME OF THE DUST  FROM THE BELLOWS MAY BE BLOWN INTO IT THE METHOD WHICH  I USED TO CHANGE THE AIR WAS TO SUCK IT OUT BY MEANS OF AN  AIRPUMP THROUGH A TUBE WHICH ENTERED INTO THE BOTTLE  AND DID NOT FILL UP THE MOUTH SO CLOSE BUT WHAT AIR COULD  ENTER IN FROM WITHOUT TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THAT DRAWN  OUT THROUGH THE TUBE  I AM C WITH REGARD TO THE MAIN EXPERIMENT IT WAS NOT IN MY POWER TO GIVE HIM FURTHER INFORMATION THAN I DID AS I POINTED OUT VOL LXXVIII P P THE276 MR CAVENDISHS EXPERIMENTS C THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE TO WHICH AT THAT TIME I COULD ATTRI BUTE THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR RESULTS AND WITH REGARD TO THE MANNER OF PREPARING THE DEPHLOGISTICATED AIR FROM THE BLACK POWDER I HAVE MENTIONED ALL THE PARTICULARS IN WHICH MY MANNER OF PROCEEDING DIFFERED FROM DR PRIESTLEYS AND HAVE ALSO EXPLAINED ON WHAT I IMAGINE THE SUCCESS INTIRELY DE PENDS SO THAT I BELIEVE NO ONE AT ALL CONVERSANT IN THIS KIND OF EXPERIMENTS WILL THINK THAT I DID NOT COMMUNICATE TO HIM MY METHOD OF PROCURING THAT AIR

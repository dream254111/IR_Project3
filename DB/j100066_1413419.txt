may be worth while to call attention to the Indian Hindu Harmonium manufactured by Messrs Moore and Moore New Oxford Street Lon don at the price of twenty pounds Style and finish are like those of the Ellis Harmonical made by the same firm instructions for tuning are furnished so that the possible effect of the journey upon intona tion need not be feared The harmonium designed with Mr K B Devals assistance by Mr H K Moore is fully described in a recent work by E ClementsIntroduction to the Study of Indian Music Longmans Green  Co 1913 2o00 net A more technical account is given in Specifications of Inventions etc 1911 lxxviii London Patent Office I913 under no 15548 Every octave has 23 notes giving the 22 srutis or degrees of the Indian scale with one additional note for modulation the II extra notes are played by pressure upon studs which pierce the black and white manuals The instrument is of great value both for classroom demonstration and for research II A THAYER TIGER Readers of A H and G H Thayers Concealing Coloration in the Animal Kingdom this JOURNAL XXi 1910 500 ff will remember the plate of the jaguar seen upon a background of forest leaves and the photographs of the cardboard zebra against reeds and straws pp 132 138 which illustrate typical obliterative picturepatterns of countershaded mammals These plates are sufficiently striking even though the animals appear in the flat and even though the fixity of the cameralens and the absence of color in the photographs make against obliteration The disappearance of the real animal into its background under favorable conditions of illumination is wonderfully shown by the model here pictured The model built by Mr A H Thayer is that of a tiger posed amidst long grass and seen against a grassy background The two photographs were taken by the same camera with no change of circumstance other than the shift of illumination In the lefthand figure the tiger stands out solid and substantial light and dark just as it might be seen upon the floor of a menagerie cage the lighting is due to three electric bulbs two below and one to the right of the model In the righthand figure in which the lighting simulates that of direct sunlight the animal has lost solidity has become amazingly transparent and merges as a colorpattern into the background An observer who views the change in an otherwise darkened room at a distance of some 15 m from a point squarely in front of the model will literally lose the tiger for some ten seconds with monocular vision he will lose it for a longer time No doubt the sudden increase in the intensity of light aids this disappearancethough it must be   i o   i IIII ii LABORATORY NOTES 297 remembered on the other side that the animal stays in place and that its contour is wellknown when the change occurs If the sunlighteffect is shown first to an untrained observer minutes may elapse before the tiger is made out when it is made out certain details especially of neck and head may be erroneously interpreted and it is judged when found to be painted on glass and not modelled in the round so that the assumption of solidity when the switch is turned comes with a distinct shock of surprise I am more impressed however by the magnitude of the change when observed with full knowledge of lighting and construction The model has been set up permanently in the demonstrational labora tory of our Department of Psychology It is the first model that Mr Thayer has built for public exhibition President Sanford and Professor Yerkes who have seen it join with me in the wish that its authoror some young artist of competence working under his directionmight be enabled to prepare similar models for the prin cipal psychological and biological laboratories of the country III THE HOLMGREN WORSTEDS I have examined a number of sets of the Holmgren Worsteds as supplied by various dealers and find that they differ very considerably Holmgren himself Om Fiirgblindheten Upsala 1877 p 135 men tions as his authorized agent Frl Letty Oldberg of Upsala Frl Oldberg still supplies the worsteds and though they differ a little from the standards shown in Holmgrens colored plate they agree more closely with these originals than does any other set that I have seen while the differences are such as might be expected on the hypothesis that the colors of the plate are somewhat faded The Holmgren test is so rough that the diversity of the sets found on the market probably makes very little difference in the results pro vided that there is a sufficiently full series of skeins for comparison For this reason I do not think it worth while to enter into particu lars Since however the test is still widely used and since the educa tional importance of holding to a standard can in general hardly be overestimated I have advised the C H Stoelting Co to import the Oldberg series and to supply it to all psychological and educational laboratories which order the Holmgren Worsteds Mr Stoelting will furnish these authorized sets as soon as they can be procured IV THE HERING GREY PAPERS The set of 50o Hering grey papers has not proved satisfactory2 Aside from the fact that many sheets are tinged with color a fact to which I called attention in Experimental Psychology I ii 19oi 1 The plate is reproduced in J E Jennings ColorVision and Color Blindness 1896 frontispiece and in Report of Royal Society Com mittee on ColorVision 1892 facing p 96 In the examples that I have seen the reproductions differ both from each other and from the Holmgren original 2 1 authorized the C H Stoelting Co in 19o2 to import these papers I was not as I need hardly say responsible for the form of the advertisement in the firms circular of that year The advertise ment was written with a too confiding trust in the statement of the German manufacturer298 TITCHENER 32 the numbered series is often markedly uneven The Leipzig manufacturer Herr Mitter sends the following information Where the divergent shades occur you have to do with a remanu facture of particular numbers The reason is this particular numbers are often ordered from the series while the less used numbers remain in stock Then in order to make the series complete the numbers that have been sold out are manufactured afresh It is unfortunately impossible exactly to reproduce the original shades a minute difference always appears and though this difference may be hardly noticeable in itself that is I suppose when the two papers the new and the old are compared it does show faintly in the series I have no doubt that this explanation is correct and it is readily conceivable that without a more careful process of manufacture than the demand for these papers and the price at which they sell now warrant some unevenness is inevitable I must add however that Herr Mitter seriously understates the defects of the series His letter goes on to say that he has received no complaints from his German customers and yet Hering himself wrote in 1907 Lehre vom Licht sinn 83 The series of grey papers prepared commercially at my suggestion unfortunately leave much to be desired The C H Stoelting Co has gone carefully over its stock regrading and renumbering and Herr Mitter undertakes in future  die Differen zen auszugleichen so gut es technisch m6glich ist But when all is done unevenness will remain and it should be understood that a reference to Hering grey no soandso indicates only approxi mately the grey actually employed The papers are exceedingly use ful they cannot however be relied upon as standards V THE HERING INDIRECTVISION COLORMIXER Certain passages in Rands Factors that Influence the Sensitivity of the Retina to Color I913 56 give the impressionso it seems to me and to other readers whom I have questionedthat the Hering IndirectVision ColorMixer was designed not by Hering but by Hess It is hardly likely that the writer fell into this mistake but since some unwary student may be misled I take this occasion to point out that the instrument has always been ascribed to Hering in Rothes catalogues and that Hess himself puts the matter beyond question Arch f Ophthal xxxv 4 1889 25 by the remark Diesen For derungen wurden in der folgenden Weise mit Hilfe eines von Herrn Professor Hering angegebenen Apparates erfiillt Rand asserts in a footnote that my Exp Psych I ii 1901 20 ascribes the description of this apparatus to Hering giving as refer ence A f 0 1889 xxv 4 p 63 I do not however ascribe the description of the apparatus but the apparatus itself to Hering and my reference is not xxv but xxxv In the article to which I refer Hering mentions the nach neuen Methoden angestellten Versuche of Hess with a footnote reference to Hess own paper and Hess p 2 speaks in like language of the neuen von ihm Hering an gegebenen Untersuchungsmethoden The Sachlage is surely clear enough Rand fails to state that I mention Hess on p 26 VI THE HERING COLORBLINDNESS APPARATUS The original description of Herings apparatus for testing colorblind ness figured in my Exp Psych I ii 190go 7 speaks of eine dem Apparate beigelegte Anweisung a set of directions for the adjustLABORATORY NOTES 299 ment of the instrument in order to the performance of a test without waste of time This Anweisung has been mentioned in various dealers catalogues There seems to be a reference to it in Spindler and Hoyers large Catalogue XXI preface dated 9go8  Mit dem Ap parate we read wird eine Beschreibung nach Hering mitgeliefert in welcher angegeben ist welche Farben man zu wihlen und wie man bei der Herstellung der Gleichung zu verfahren hat p 69 But this sentence may refer on the other hand simply to Herings account excerpted from the Arch f Ophthal which was formerly supplied by Rothe and in whichto be surethe apparatus is de scribed but which also contains the primary reference to the elusive Anweisung At any rate I have never been able to secure the set of directions in question although I have made enquiry of a number of colleagues have written to Professor Hering himself and have asked the prin cipal dealers Spindler and Hoyer included whether copies were available If any reader of this JOURNAL happens to possess the Anweisung I shall be grateful for the loan of it and will undertake with the owners permission to reprint it There is no particular dif ficulty in the use of the instrument provided that man sich auf den Standpunkt der Theorie der Gegenfarben stelle but uniformity of procedure is none the less desirable VII DEMONSTRATIONS OF COLORBLIND VISION Various attempts have been made to indicate by colored diagrams the appearance of familiar objects as seen by the partially colorblind I The Report of the Royal Societys I89p Committee on Color Vision 1892 prints facing p 4 a plate of 5 spectra normal green blind redblind violetblind induced by disease The plate is signed W de W Abney 2 A similar plate signed with the same initials and prepared by the same lithographer but printed with right left conversion forms the frontispiece of W de W Abneys Color Vision 1895 In the copy belonging to the Cornell University Library blue is entirely absent I should say from the general freshness of the plate that by an oversight the blue pigment had never been ap plied 3 The frontispiece of E W Scriptures Thinking Feeling Doing 1895 shows the American flag as seen by most people by red blind persons by greenblind persons by violetblind persons by totally colorblind persons In the edition of 1907 this plate has been sup pressed though a table on p 136 tells how the flag appears to tri chromats dichromats I dichromats II greenblind redblind blue blind and monochromats 4 In W F Norris and C H Oliver System of Diseases of the Eye ii 1897 W Thomson and C Weiland print four colored spectra facing p 315 that of the normal eye a combined spectrum of potassium lithium sodium thallium and caesium that of the greenblind and that of the redblind person 5 In The Century Magazine for April 19o7 lxxiii 882 ff E A Ayers has colored plates of roses and leaves as seen by normal redblind and greenblind eyes of three shades of red green violet as seen by three classes of colorblind and of a Venetian scene as it appears to normal eyes and to a person partially colorblind in red 6 There are colored plates of spectra again in Abneys Researches in Color Vision 1913 Plate I facing p 275 shows according to its legend  spectrum colors as named by persons who were completely or nearly completely red or green blind or shows according to the text p300 TITCHENER 275 how the completely red blind for instance sees the spectrum All of these chartsand there are doubtless others that I do not knoware in one way or another misleading whether the mistakes are due to theoretical bias to the difficulties of color printing or to sheer ignorance3 Yet it is distinctly of advantage to have demon strations of the spectrum of the partially colorblind ordinary redgreen blindness the blindness of the deuteranope or green blind and the less common redgreen blindness of the protanope or redblind the demonstration ad oculos is convincing and saves the lecturers time I have therefore had two large spectra painted in oil by Mr L A Fuertes the canvases about 150 by o0 cm were first marked off roughly at halfadozen points for the principal colors then subdivided for more accurate work into 35 or 40 strips of equal breadth and then colored as quickly as possible from an already prepared palette The yellowseries offers considerable technical diffi culty aside from questions of tint and chroma it is exceedingly diffi cult to rule out every hint of green General surroundings make more difference in this regard than even the trained eye would suspect so that a spectrum which appears greenless in the studio may show a faint wash of green when hung upon the wall of the lectureroom This fact makes me hesitate to undertake the preparation of these spectra for others Our own pair are excellent in our surroundings and so long as Mr Fuertes services are available can be duplicated in wide black frames for about 25 apiece VIII A DEMONSTRATION OF  TIED IMAGES  I owe to Dr W S Foster the suggestion that the pictures of Coles Phillips are useful for the demonstration of  tied visual images In particular the young lady who is on her knees before a box of silver has been reproduced on a large scale for advertising purposes De prived of the silver the unkindness is justified psychologically because the box gives the outline of her knee and pasted upon a deadblack background she is an instructive figure the observer sees a great deal that is not there to be seen and the imaginal vision is so far as our experience goes practically uniform at certain points tied imagery and extremely variable at others 3 C L Franklin Science xxv 1907 746

j100168,Harvard Law Review,1322535,Scope of the Remedy of Interpleader,i256879,SCOPE OF THE REMEDY OF INTERPLEADER  The equitable remedy by bill of interpleader seems always to have been regarded by the courts with peculiar jealousy and surrounded by unfortunate and unnecessary restric iions This tendency is illustrated by a recent decision under a statute allowing interpleader by motion the statute being as is usual in such cases construed as not extending the scope of the equitable remedy but only introducing it under different procedure into courts of law A pur chaser who was sued for the contract price of chattels sold and delivered to him was denied the right to interplead his vendor and one Coleman who claimed to be the owner of the chattels which he alleged had been converted by the vendor Coleman v Chambers 29 So Rep 58 Ala One ground of the decision was that the adverse claims were not for the62 HARVARD LAW REVIEW same thing that of the vendor being for the contract price and that of Coleman for damages for conversion by the vendee This objection would of course be final if the facts supported it But it distinctly appears that Coleman claimed the contract price and the inquiry should have been whether he showed any basis for such a claim It would seem that one whose goods have been conxerted and sold in exchange for a contract obligation on the part of the vendee might by bill in equity enforce a constructive trust of that obligation and thus claim the price from the vendee if for any reason the legal remedy was inadequate There are a few decisions involving the same principle in which the equitable remedy was allowed American Sugar etc Co v Fauclher 145 N Y 552 Cf Kaufman v Wiene i69 Ill 596 Judging from the lan guage of previous Alabama cases and the nature of modern practice the fact that the claim was equitable would be no objection to its introduc tion under the statutory interpleader though there seems to be no con clusive authority on the question In this view of the case another question might arise It has been repeatedly laid down as law in cases and textbooks that a bailee agent tenant or vendee cannot maintain a bill of interpleader against his bailor principal landlord or vendor and a third person claiming by independ ent or paramount title Just what is meant by independent title is not entirely clear As the rule is sometimes stated it seems to be based on the notion of a confidential or personal relation between the stakeholder and one claimant which forbids the stakeholder to quiestion the original right of that claimant although it allows him to interplead the latter and a third person who claims to have acquired such original right by assign ment attachment or other method since its origin 3 Pomeroy Eq Jurisp 2d ed  1327 The language of the courts which adopt this view however is broader than most of the decisions require and other cases apparently rest the rule on a less artificial foundation namely the requirement that both claimants shall demand not only the same thing but by virtue of the same debt or duty It is said for example that a bailees duty to his bailor and to a third person who claims the chattel merely as owner are essentially different obligations Crawshay v Thornton 2 Myl  Cr i This gives the rule a logical basis and explains most of the decisions but even in this form the rule introduces a needless restriction which the framers of the English Common Law Procedure Act took pains to eliminate from the statutory interpleader and apart from statute the soundness of the decision in Crawshay v Tlorion has been doubted both in England anid in this country Atten borough v London etc Co L R 3 C P D 450 456 458 Crane v AcDoIZald i i8 N Y 648 656 The case has been generally followed but often with reluctance and a few decisions apparently reject its prin ciple altogether First Nat Bank etc v Bininger 26 N J Eq 345 Chiid v Mantn L R 3 Eq 8o6 But accepting the principle of Craw shay v Thornton as law it would nevertheless follow that one who does niot deny the validity of the obligation between the stakeholder and his principal or vendor but attempts to secure to himself the benefit of that obligation on the theory of a constructive trust claims as against the stake holder by virtue of the same debt or duty and not by independent title A bill of interpleader has been allowed in such a case Goddardv Leech Wright Ohio 476 In another case of the same sort the rule as to paramount title seems to have been rested on the less satisfactory groundNVOTES 63 of the obligations imposed by a confidential relation and the bill was dismissed Marvinwv Ewood iI Paige 365 The opposite result was reached in the same state in a similar case where the trust was not constructive but express Richards v Salter 6 Johns Ch 445 If the rule in question rests on identity of obligation it would not exclude an interpleader in the principal case If it rests on anything else it is arti ficial contradicted by a number of cases and not likely to be generally followed The most troublesome objection to an interpleader in the principal case remains to be considered the objection that if Colemans claim was correct the vendee was a tortfeasor It has been held in several cases that where one of the adverse claims is based on the commission of a tort by the stakeholder the interpleader cannot be allowed Shaw v Cos ter 8 Paige 339 Ha6feld v Mc Whorter 4o Ga 269 The refusal to deliver a chattel to either of two claimants simply on the ground of the conflicting claims followed at once by proceedings to make the claimants interplead though involving a technical conversion is not of course within the rule But beyond that no distinction is made between inten tional and unintentional torts It is obviously just to refuse to a wilful wrongdoer the protection of a bill of interpleader but where the stake holder has acted conscientiously throughout and in perfect good faith and now asks only to be allowed to determine in the surest manner which claimant is entitled the rule which denies him such relief on the ground of a technical tort seems altogether inequitable UnfQrtunately however there seems to be no authority on the other side and the Alabama court was amply justified in following the established rule

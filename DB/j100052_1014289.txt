j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1014289,Food in the Reconstruction Period,i242671,Food in the Reconstruction Period By J S CRUTCHFIELD ViceAdministrator United States Food Administration for Pennsylvania IF food played a vital part in winning the war it occupies rela tively an even more important place in bringing about tran quility during the armistice and in the period of reconstruction The drastic food regulations imposed upon our country shortly after our entering the war were cheerfully accepted on the assur ance of Mr Hoover and the President that the regulations were a matter of a military necessity The effectiveness and success of the Food Administration was largely due to the fact that it reached every man woman and child in the nation as well as the men women and children of the Allies and those of the neutral countries dependent upon us The stimulation of industry and business in the United States so greatly increased the purchasing power of our people that if they had been so inclined they could easily have consumed and paid for a large portion of the food that we exported as well as that which was used The stabilization of food prices by the enforce ment of the law requiring middle men to sell all food products at cost plus a prewar profit without regard to market or replace ment value would also have encouraged an abnormally large consumption were it not for the conservation regulations volun tarily observed by the rank and file of our people The habit of the general public in adapting their diet to those foods which the market afforded as compared with what they ordinarily de manded played a large part in bringing about the desired results REDUCED INCOMES AND FOOD PRICES In this period of reconstruction the average income of our workers is materially reduced and advantage must be taken of the habits acquired of necessity during the war of substituting the use of those foods which are abundant and relatively cheap in price for those foodstuffs wlichl ilnder normal conditions we have been accustomed to demand In the exigencies of the pres ent situation there is an urgent delmand for statutory regulations 7THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY that will afford relief The people on the one hand wish to be freed from the onerous regulations and exactions of the war food laws in the matter of what they shall and what they shall not eat and on the other hand be protected against high prices and profiteering We are confronted with a condition and not a theory substan tial relief will not come to the public by the enacting of new laws against profiteering The unalterable law of supply and denland will determine the price of food Herbert Hoover did not as some suppose suspend the law of supply and demand He persuaded the public to stop demanding certain foods in the usual quantities in consideration of which he was able to furnish what food was actually needed at a stabilized and comparatively reasonable price The law regulating the profits of middle men without being accompanied concurrently by a voluntary general conservation in the use of food on the part of the public would not tend to lower or stabilize the price to the consumer Any profits that such a law would keep back from the middle man would auto matically go to the producer This is an indisputable and well established fact although difficult to comprehend on the part of many of our best economists It is a fact which must be recog nized immediately not only by the public but by Congress if the real solution of the present difficulties is to be found and made effective The solution of the problem of a decreased income and sustained high prices on many foodstuffs is found in the general adoption of the same habits of substitution and conservation in the use of foodstuffs as were practiced of necessity during the war He that controlleth his own appetite and adapteth his taste to what the market affords is greater than he that deviseth many laws against profiteering In other words this which the public is looking to the law makers to supply them with in the form of protection against exorbitant food prices lies within their own control Necessity is the mother of invention Misfortunes and even calamities are frequently blessings in disguise It would indeed be unfortunate if the valuable lessons in diet and in market ing which we were just beginning to learn were not driven home by a continued application during this period of readjustment The grossest ignorance exists in this country as to the relative 8FOOD IN THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD values of our large variety of foodstuffs There are scores of different kinds of foodstuffs which can be produced at onethird to onehalf the cost of production of the kinds of food which we have customarily consumed True it will require perhaps greater culinary skill to prepare these foods acceptably but it is all within easy reach of accomplishment Could the public be lieve this possible by making habitual and general those simple conservation measures which amounted to enough during the war to feed one hundred and twenty millions of our Allies without creating any undue hardship on our own people they would seek some agency that would direct and lead to such a movement The officials of the United States Food Administration in con nection with the United States Department of Agriculture Office of Markets have formulated a system of publicity which will in form and educate the public to a certain degree particularly on perishable foodstuffs Much more needs to be done in the mat ter of information and education in the more staple lines This would afford a splendid activity for those organized agencies which developed such a high state of efficiency in contributing to the winning of the war There is conspicuous absence of common sense and reasoning in the consideration of the food problems It is difficult though perhaps necessary to make provision for that considerable por tion of our people who live one day at a time No measure has been discovered to assist themindeed it may be undesirable to afford permanent help to those people who will not help them selves There is almost universal complaint on the part of the consumer because of the apparent profiteering on the part of the producer and a lack of understanding as to why the producers prices are not regulated The average family should not be so much interested in the cost of living this week or this month as they are in the average cost of living during the next twelve months or in fact as they are in the average cost of living during the entire reconstruction period of several years duration BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF LIVING Once again let me emphasize the indisputable fact that there are only two ways of bringing down the cost of living First by increasing the supply which is accomplished by paying the pro ducer an attractive price for his product Within a reasonable 910 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY time this invariably results in greatly increased production ex cept for providential interference Second by the economical use and wise choice of the kinds of foods consumedin other words the voluntary regulation of the demand These two factors an increasing supply on the one hand and a decreasing or well controlled demand on the other hand will give an average cost of foodstuffs which must be most satisfactory and gratifying To expect the food supply and prices to remain on an even level during these abnormal reconstruction days when the whole world is looking to the American market for an undue share of our supplies would be to expect conditions that obtain in no other department of life Hence the importance of acquiring the habit of adapting oneself to the supplies in the market and of accepting some of the ups and downs of prices in the cost of living We must recognize that of a necessity some periods of weeks or months naturally will favor the producer This will be a period of high prices which in turn will stimulate increased production Other periods of low prices of corresponding length will favor the consumer and have a tendency to decrease produc tion The Food Administration in conjunction with the federal and state departments have also formulated and encouraged the pass ing of laws which will regulate to a reasonable degree the distrib utors of foodstuffs Among other things it is proposed that many classes of middle men shall be relicensed particularly commission merchants and the packers The National League of Commission Merchants at their annual convention in January at Boston adopted resolutions favoring the licensing of the commission business in fruits and vegetables This will tend to eliminate the tricky and dishonest factors in the business which alike is a pro tection to the public and to the legitimate members of the trade In considering these vital food matters I have purposely re frained from referring to the larger and more unselfish question of conservation and the habits of eating which will best enable us to succor a faminestricken Europe It is obvious that what will serve our own economic needs in the matter of controlling the cost of living at home will most effectually aid those millions of stricken humanity in the wardevastated regions of Europe many millions of whom it must be remembered are suffering terri bly from wounds and disease directly due to the war

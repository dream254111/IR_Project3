MICHAEL FARADAY ESQ DCL FRS FULLERIAN PROF CHEM ROYAL INSTITUTION 2C SSC C BY J FREDERIC DANIELL ESQ FOR SEC RS PROF CHEM IN KINGS COLLEGE LONDON RECEIVED APRIL 22READ APRIL 28 1842 MY DEAR FARADAY I MUST BEG PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOU ONCE MORE UPON THE SUBJECT OF VOLTAIC COM BINATIONS TO THIS I AM PROMPTED BY SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE BEAUTIFUL LAW OF OHM AND THE SIMPLE EXPRESSION WHICH HE HAS GIVEN OF THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AND RESISTANCES OF A VOLTAIC CIRCUIT ENABLE ME TO REVIEW WITH ADVANTAGE AND TO CORRECT MANY OF THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH I HAD DERIVED FROM FORMER EXPERIMENTS AND HAVE SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS THE RESULTS OF WHICH WILL TEND I TRUST TO REMOVE SOME OBSCURITIES AND AMBIGUITIES WHICH WERE LEFT IN MY FORMER COMMUNICATIONS 2ND BY FOLLOWING OUT THESE PRINCIPLES I SHALL BE ENABLED TO OFFER SOME PRACTICAL REMARKS UPON THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF VOLTAIC BATTERIES WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FOR WARD TO ASSIST THE SPECULATIONS OF THE ACTIVE INQUIRERS WHO IN THE PRESENT DAY ARE SO EAGERLY ENGAGED IN APPLYING THE VOLTAIC FORCES TO THE SERVICE OF THE ARTS 3RD I WISH MOST PARTICULARLY TO EXPLAIN MORE FULLY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CYLINDRI CAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BATTERY WHICH I HAVE INTRODUCED AND WHICH APPEAR TO ME TO HAVE BEEN GREATLY MISUNDERSTOOD I AM DESIROUS HOWEVER THAT YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT I DO NOT PRESENT THE FOL LOWING OBSERVATIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF TESTING THE LAW IN QUESTION OR OF DETERMINING CONSTANTS CONNECTED WITH THE FORMULA FOR THAT COULD ONLY BE SATISFACTORILY EFFECTED BY EXPERIMENTS OF A MUCH MORE DELICATE AND ACCURATE NATURE THAN THOSE TO WHICH I SHALL HAVE TO REFER BUT WITH A VIEW TO SHOW HOW GENERALLY THE LAW APPLIES EVEN TO THE PRACTI CAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CARRIED ON UPON WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A MANUFACTURING SCALE IN WHICH DISTURBING INFLUENCES ARE NUMEROUS AND IN A GREAT MEASURE UNCONTROLABLE PROFESSOR OHM HAS ADOPTED I BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL CONCUR WITH ME IN THINKING MDCCCXLII TPROFESSOR DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS UNFORTUNATELY THE CONTACT THEORY OF THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AND ALTHOUGH HIS FOR MULA IS EASILY ADAPTED TO EITHER OF THE TWO RIVAL VIEWS IT IS PERHAPS NECESSARY IN SELECTING THE CHEMICAL THEORY THAT I SHOULD DEFINE THE EXACT MEANING WHICH I ATTACH TO HIS SYMBOLS AND EXPLAIN THE EXPANSIONS WHICH I THINK IT NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE THE FORMULA YOU WILL REMEMBER IS E RR A WHERE E REPRESENTS THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE SO CALLED IN THE CELL R THE RESISTANCES IN THE CELL R THE AMOUNT OF EXTERIOR RESISTANCES A THE EFFECTIVE FORCE MEASURED BY THE WORK PERFORMED NOW ACCORDING TO THE CHEMICAL VIEW E MUST BE THE BALANCE OF SEVERAL ACTIVE FORCES IN THE CELL 1ST THE SUPERIOR AFFINITY OF THE GENERATING PLATE FOR THE ANION OF THE ELECTROLYTE WHICH WE WILL DESIGNATE BY B 2ND THE INFERIOR AFFINITY OF THE CONDUCTING PLATE FOR THE SAME ANION WHICH WE WILL CALL B 3RD THE AFFINITY OF THE CATION DISENGAGED FROM THE ELECTROLYTE AND ACCUMULATED UPON THE CONDUCTING PLATE FOR THE ANION THIS WE WILL CALL E THESE TWO LAST TEND TO PRODUCE POLARIZATION AS IT IS NOT VERY APPROPRIATELY CALLED AND A CURRENT IN THE OP POSITE DIRECTION TO B THEREFORE E  B  B  E OR E B B  E R THE RESISTANCE IN THE CELL VARIES DIRECTLY AS THE THICKNESS OF THE ELECTROLYTE OR THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE GENERATING AND CONDUCTING PLATES D AND INVERSELY AS THE AREA OF THE SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE S THEREFORE R  R REPRESENTS ALL THE EXTERIOR RESISTANCES WHETHER METALLIC OR ELECTROLYTIC IN THE METALLIC PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT IT WILL BE INVERSELY AS THE AREA OF THE SECTION I E THE SQUARE OF THE DIAMETER OF THE WIRE S AND DIRECTLY AS THE LENGTH 1 OR DISTANCE THROUGH WHICH THE CURRENT PASSES IN ELECTROLYTIC WORK THIS METALLIC RESISTANCE MAY GENE RALLY BE DISREGARDED THE LENGTHS OF THE CONNECTING WIRES BEING INSIGNIFICANT WITH REGARD TO THE RESISTANCE OF THE ELECTROLYTE THIS LATTER WILL BE INVERSELY AS THE AREA OF THE SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE S AND DIRECTLY AS THE DISTANCE D BETWEEN THE ELEC TRODES THEREFORE I D R 7 R I BUT WE MUST NOW INQUIRE PARTICULARLY WHAT IT IS WE MEAN BY THE SECTION OF THE ELEC TROLYTE THE LIMITS OF THE SECTION OF THE METALLIC CONDUCTOR ARE STRICT AND EASILY  THE RESISTANCE OF EACH LIQUID IS SPECIFIC AND DEPENDS UPON THE NATURE OF THE LIQUID THE DEGREE OF SATURATION IF A SOLUTION AND THE TEMPERATURE THESE CIRCUMSTANCES REMAINING CONSTANT IT ALSO IS CONSTANT AND IS SO CONSIDERED IN THIS REVIEW OF THE FORMULA 138PROFESSOR DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS DETERMINED BUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE DIFFUSIVE NATURE OF THE ELECTROLYTIC FORCE AND THE WIDE SPREAD OF THAT POLARIZATION OF THE PARTICLES OF AN ELECTROLYTE WHICH WE HAVE TRACED UPON A FORMER OCCASION TO THE BACK SURFACE OF A CONDUCTING PLATE OPPOSED TO A MERE POINT OF GENERATING METAL IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO DEFINE THE LIMITS OF ITS ACTION SO AS TO SATISFY THE CONDITIONS OF THEFORMULA IN A CELL COMPOSED OF A PLATE OF GENERATING METAL WITH A CONDUCTING PLATE OF EQUAL DIMENSIONS THE INTERPOSED ELECTROLYTE ONLY WETTING THE OPPOSITE FACES OF THE TWO METALS THE AREA OF THE SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE WILL CLEARLY BE EQUAL TO THE AREA OF THE ACTING SURFACE OF THE CONDUCTING PLATE IN CASE THE TWO METALS SHOULD BE IM IMERSED IN A TROUGH IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO ALLOW OF THE ELECTROLYTE BEING IN CONTACT WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE PLATES IT IS ALSO PROBABLE THAT THE ACTION OF THE BACK SURFACES MIGHT BE DISREGARDED WITHOUT DANGER OF MATERIAL ERROR IN OUR CALCULATIONS ALTHOUGH WE KNOW IN FACT THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE WHOLLY PASSIVE UP TO THIS POINT THERE FORE THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN THE APPLICATION OF OHMS FORMULA BUT HOW ARE WE TO DETERMINE THE AREA OF THE SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE WHEN THE SURFACES OF THE GENERATING AND CONDUCTING PLATES ARE NOT EQUAL AS FOR INSTANCE IN THE CASE OF A ROD OF ZINC PLACED WITHIN A CYLINDER OF COPPER IS IT REFERRIBLE SOLELY TO THE SURFACE OF THE CONDUCTING PLATE  OR IS IT LIMITED BY THE MEAN OF THE SURFACES OF THE TWO PLATES  THE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THIS POINT ALTHOUGH THE FINAL RESULT IS EXTREMELY SIMPLE HAS COST ME MUCH LABOUR THE APPARENTLY UNLIMITED SPREAD OR RADIATION OF THE FORCE FROM A POINT OF GENERATING METAL OVER AN INDEFINITELY LARGE SURFACE OF CONDUCTING METAL STRONGLY SUGGESTED THE FIRST CONCLUSION THIS WAS MOREOVER CONFIRMED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATION VIZ IF WE TAKE THE MEAN SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE AS DETERMINED BY THE MEAN OF THE SURFACES OF THE TWO METALLIC PLATES BETWEEN WHICH IT IS INCLUDED IT IS CLEAR THAT THE RESULT OUGHT TO BE THE SAME WHETHER THE GENERATING OR CONDUCTING METAL BE THE LARGER OF THE TWO A ROD OF COPPER PLACED WITHIN A CYLINDER OF ZINC OUGHT TO CIRCULATE THE SAME AMOUNT OF FORCE AS A ROD OF ZINC PLACED WITHIN A CYLINDER OF COPPER THE DIMENSIONS IN BOTH CASES BEING RESPECTIVELY THE SAME NOW THE RESULTS OF A VAST NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS SOME OF WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED TO YOUT SEEMNED TO PROVE THAT SO FAR FROM THIS BEING THE CASE THE AMOUNT OF FORCE IS REDUCED ONEHALF WHEN THE LINES OF FORCE ARE MADE TO CONVERGE FROM A LARGE GENERATING SURFACE TOWARDS A SMALL CONDUCTING ONE INSTEAD OF DIVERGING IN THE CON TRARY ARRANGEMENT FROM A SMALL GENERATOR TO A LARGE CONDUCTOR THESE EXPERIMENTS I HAVE AGAIN REPEATED AND WHEN I MADE USE OF SULPHATE OF COPPER IN DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AS THE ELECTROLYTE WITH THE SAME GENERAL RESULTS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF RECONCILING THIS WITH THE LAW AND THE NECESSITY OF DETERMINING A POINT OF SUCH FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TOGETHER WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF UNSTEADI NESS OF ACTION IN THE EXPERIMENTS INDUCED ME AT LENGTH TO CHANGE THE ELECTROLYTE FOR ONE WHICH WOULD BE LESS LIABLE TO ALTER ITS CONDITION DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1838 PART I P 54 T IBID PP 47 49 53 T2 139PROFESSOR DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS OBSERVATIONS THE ARRANGEMENT WHICH I ADOPTED WAS THAT OF HOLLOW CYLINDERS OF AMALGAMATED ZINC WITH PLATINUM WIRE AND WIRE OF AMALGAMATED ZINC WITH PLATINUM CYLINDERS ALL OF EQUAL HEIGHTS  AND THE ELECTROLYTE IN CONTACT WITH THE ZINC CONSISTED OF STANDARD DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID SEPARATED BY A POROUS TUBE FROM STRONG NITRIC ACID IN CONTACT WITH THE PLATINUM A BREGUETS THERMOMETER ADAPTED TO THE PUR POSES OF A GALVANOMETER WAS SELECTED AS A MEASURE OF THE EFFECTS THE FOLLOWING TABLE EXHIBITS THE RESULTS  TABLE I DIAMETER OF ZINC DIAMETER OF PLATINUM DEGREES OF GALVANOMETER INCHES 24 WIRE 274 MEAN OF THREE OBSERVATIONS WIRE 2 255 MEAN OF THREE OBSERVATIONS WIRE 1I 279 1 WIRE 273 270 MEAN THE NEEDLE ALWAYS RETURNED AFTER EACH EXPERIMENT TO THE POINT FROM WHICH IT STARTED THERE CAN BE NO DIFFICULTY IN TAKING THESE RESULTS AS SENSIBLY EQUAL AND IT IS THEREFORE EVIDENT THAT A WIRE OF PLATINUM PLACED WITHIN A CYLINDER OF ZINC ESTABLISHED A CURRENT OF EXACTLY THE SAME FORCE AS A WIRE OF ZINC PLACED WITHIN A CYLINDER OF PLA TINUM OF EQUAL DIAMETER HENCE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT THE AREA OF THE EFFICIENT SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE IS THE MEAN OF THE OPPOSED FACES OF THE METAL PLATES BUT HOW SHALL WE ACCOUNT FOR THE CONTRARY RESULTS WITH SULPHATE OF COPPER AS THE ELECTROLYTE WHICH WERE CAREFULLY MADE AND GREATLY VARIED BUT WHICH ALWAYS GAVE A CONSISTENT RESULT OF ABOUT ONEHALF THE FORCE WHEN THE CONLUCTING WAS VERY SMALL IN PROPORTION TO THE GENERATING SURFACE BY SUBSTITUTING ACID SULPHATE OF COPPER FOR NITRIC ACID IN THE ARRANGEMENT JUST DESCRIBED AND CAREFULLY ATTENDING TO THE PROGRESS OF THE EXPERIMENT THE EXPLANATION BECAME OBVIOUS WHEN THE PLATINUM WIRE WAS PLACED IN THE POROUS TUBE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ZINC CYLINDER UPON FIRST CONNECTION WITH THE CALORIFIC GALVANOMETER THE NEEDLE ADVANCED TO 83 BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO RETURN TILL IT REACHED 28 AT WHICH POINT IT REMAINED STATIONARY WHEN THE WIRE WAS WITHDRAWN IT WAS FOUND COVERED WITH COPPER IN A SPONGY OR PULVERULENT FORM IT WAS WIPED AND REPLACED AND THE NEEDLE ADVANCED TO 85 BUT IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO RETROGRADE AND FELL AGAIN TO 28 THIS PROCESS WAS REPEATED MANY TIMES AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT IF WHILE THE GALVANOMETER WAS AT ITS HIGHEST POINT THE WIRE WAS MOVED ABOUT AND THE LIQUID KEPT IN A STATE OF AGITATION THE NEEDLE REMAINED STEADY FOR A LONGER TIME BUT WHEN THE WIRE WAS LEFT AT REST THE NEEDLE ALWAYS RECEDED  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1838 P 42 THIS INSTRUMENT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY TO BE DEPENDED UPON WHEN THE POWER IS HIGH AND THE DIFFERENCES TO BE MEASURED GREAT ON ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCES IN ITS RATES OF COOLING 140PROFESSOR DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS WHEN ON THE CONTRARY A ZINC WIRE WAS PLACED IN THE POROUS TUBE IN THE CENTRE OF THE PLATINUM CYLINDER CHARGED WITH THE SULPHATE OF COPPER THE NEEDLE ADVANCED TO 960 UPON AN AVERAGE OF THREE EXPERIMENTS AND THEN REMAINED QUITE STEADY IN THIS CASE THE PRECIPITATED COPPER WAS EQUALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE SURFACE OF THE PLATINUM AND CONSTITUTED A COMPACT LAYER FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE PLATE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IT IS THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE STATE OF THE PRECIPITATED METAL WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULTS OF THE TWO ARRANGEMENTS IN THE LAST CASE THE ELECTROLYSIS OF THE LIQUID WAS CARRIED ON WITHOUT THE DISENGAGEMENT OF ANY ELEMENT TENDING MA TERIALLY TO PRODUCE AN OPPOSING CURRENT WHILE IN THE FIRST THE SPONGY STATE OF THE COPPER RETAINED THE LIQUID WITHIN ITS PORES WHICH AFTER THE PRECIPITATION OF ALL THE SULPHATE OF COPPER WHICH IT CONTAINED GENERATED HYDROGEN WHICH WAS EQUALLY EN TANGLED IN IT AND PRODUCED A STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT THE AMOUNT OF THIS OPPOSITION IS DEFINITE AND OF NEARLY HALF THE FORCE OF THE PRINCIPAL CURRENT  AND HENCE I WAS LED TO THE ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION REGARDING THE RELATIVE SIZES OF THE GENERATING AND CONDUCTING PLATES TAKING THE MEASURE OF THE FORCE AT THE FIRST MOMENT OF MAKING THE CONTACTS THE RESULTS SUFFICIENTLY CONFIRM THE CONCLUSION DRAWN FROM THE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE NITRIC ACID I ONCE MORE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IT IS THE MEAN SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE WHICH REGULATES THE CURRENT AND THAT IT IS INDIFFERENT WHETHER THE CONDUCTING OR THE GENERATING METAL BE THE LARGER OF THE TWO PLATES BY MEASURING THE CHEMICAL RESULTS PRODUCED FOR THIS PURPOSE I WEIGHED THE AMALGAMATED ZINC CYLINDERS AND RODS BEFORE AND AFTER THE EXPERIMENT AND ASCERTAINED THE CONSUMPTION OF METAL FOR INTER VALS OF HALF AN HOUR DURING WHICH THE CIRCUITS WERE CLOSED THE CONDUCTING METAL WAS COPPER AND THE RODS HALF AN INCH IN DIAMETER THE ELECTROLYTE WAS SULPHATE OF COPPER AND DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND WAS KEPT AGITATED DURING THE IMMERSION OF TTLE COPPER RODS THE RESULTS ARE SET DOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE TABLE II DIAMETER OF ZINC DIAMETER OF COPPER LOSS OF ZINC IN THIRTY MINUTES INCHES INCHES GRS  1 30 Y   30 2  2 2 1 30 51 91 30 THESE RESULTS PERFECTLY ACCORD WITH THE PRECEDING FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS WE ARE LED TO ANOTHER IMPORT ANT RELATION OF THE GENERATING AND CONDUCTING METALS IN THESE CYLINDRICAL ARRANGE MENTS TO UNDERSTAND WHICH IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE SURFACES OF CYLINDERS OF EQUAL HEIGHTS ARE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONED TO THEIR RADII LET US THEREFORE IMAGINE AN INDEFINITELY SMALL ROD OF A GENERATING METAL PLACED IN THE AXIS OF A CYLINDER OF CONDUCTING METAL OF A GIVEN DIAMETER FILLED WITH AN ELECTROLYTE UPON MAKING CONTACT OF THE TWO METALS A CURRENT WOULD BE ESTABLISHED OF A DEFINITE 141PROFESSOR DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS AMOUNT THE AREA OF THE MEAN SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE WOULD BE THE AREA OF A CY LINDER PLACED HALF WAY BETWEEN THE CYLINDER AND ITS AXIS OR HALF THAT OF THE CYLINDER AND IT WOULD BE THE SAME WHETHER THE GENERATING OR THE CONDUCTING METAL WERE THE EXTERIOR OF THE TWO NOW THE AMOUNT OF THE CURRENT OUGHT TO BE THE SAME WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE DIA METER OF THE EXTERIOR CYLINDER FOR THE RESISTANCE OCCASIONED BY INCREASING THE DEPTH OF THE ELECTROLYTE THAT IS TO SAY BY INCREASING THE RADIUS OF THE CYLINDER IS EXACTLY COUNTERBALANCED BY THE INCREASED CONDUCTING POWER CONFERRED BY THE INCREASED AREA OF THE SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE AND VICE VERSD THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS CON FIRM THIS CONCLUSION FOR UPON REFERENCE TO TABLE I IT WILL BE SEEN THAT CYLINDERS OF 1 INCH AND 23 INCHES DIAMETER PRODUCED UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SAME AMOUNT OF CURRENT AND FROM TABLE II WE LEARN THAT CYLINDERS OF 24 INCHES AND 5  INCHES DIAMETER HAD EQUAL INFLUENCES YOU MAY PERHAPS REMEMBER THAT IN MY FORMER COMMUNICATIONS FROM SOME EXPERIMENTS UPON THIS POINT I HAD OBTAINED SOME ANOMALOUS RESULTS WHICH OCCA SIONED ME CONSIDERABLE PERPLEXITY BUT I HAVE SINCE MULTIPLIED OBSERVATIONS SUFFI CIENTLY TO PLACE THE CONFIRMATION OF THE LAW BEYOND A DOUBT AMONGST OTHERS I REPEATED THE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE LARGE BATTERY OF TEN CELLS OF FOUR INCHES DIAMETER IN COMPARISONN WITH TEN OF 3 INCHES AND FOUND THE RESULTS SEN SIBLY THE SAME THE ORIGIN OF THE ERROR IN MY FORMER OBSERVATIONS I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DETECT BUT IT IS PROBABLY TO BE ASCRIBED TO SOME FAULT IN THE CONNECTIONS OF THE CELLS THE ADVANTAGES OF THE CONCENTRIC CYLINDRICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE ELEMENTS OF A VOLTAIC CIRCUIT ARE VERY CONSIDERABLE BOTH IN THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF ITS COMPLEX ACTIONS AND IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS THE ABSOLUTE RESTRICTION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE METALLIC PLATES TO ONE SIDE RESPECTIVELY AND THE KNOWN DEFINITE RELATIONS OF THEIR SURFACES AND DIAMETERS RENDER THE NECESSARY CALCULATIONS FOR THE FORMER OBVIOUS AND EASY WHILE FOR THE LATTER THE REDUCTION OF THE SIZE OF THE GENERATING METAL AND THE LARGE QUANTITY OF THE ELECTROLYTE WHICH IT ADMITS OF GIVE FACILITIES FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF AN ENERGETIC AND CONSTANT CURRENT OF FORCE WHICH NO OTHER ARRANGEMENT CAN SUPPLY WITH EQUAL EFFECT I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVEDT THAT THE POSITION OF THE ROD WITHIN THE CYLINDER IS IMMA TERIAL TO THE EFFECTS AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WHEREVER PLACED THEIR MEAN DISTANCES AND CONSEQUENTLY THE MEAN SECTION OF THE INTERPOSED ELECTROLYTE MUST BE THE SAME A ZINC ROD OF HALF AN INCH IN DIAMETER PLACED IN THE AXIS OF A COPPER CYLINDER 3 INCHES DIAMETER PRODUCES A CERTAIN EFFECT WHICH IS SCARCELY AUGMENTED IN AN APPRE CIABLE DEGREE BY A SECOND OR EVEN A THIRD SIMILAR ROD PLACED IN CONTACT WITH IT THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS 1 ROD  22 2 RODS  24 3 RODS  25  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1839 P 90 T IBID 1838 PP 44 49 142PROFESSOR DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS EACH ROD SEPARATELY WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE IN ITS POSITION OF PRODUCING THE FULL EFFECT OF ONE BUT EACH WAS SCREENED BY THLE TWO OTHERS FROM THE FULL ASPECT OF THE CONDUCTING CYLINDER AND BUT A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE WAS GAINED FROM THE COMBINATION BY A SLIGHT INCREASE OF THE SECTION OF THE ELECTROLYTE UNCOMPENSATED BY ANY INCREASE OF DISTANCE I ANTICIPATED THAT IF EACH ROD WERE REMOVED AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE SIDES OF THE CYLINDER SO AS TO BE EQUIDISTANT FROM THE OTHER TWO THE SCREENING INFLUENCE COULD NOT TAKE PLACE TO THE SAME EXTENT AND THAT A GREATLYINCREASED EFFECT WOULD BE PRO DUCED A GLANCE AT THE ANNEXED DIAGRAM WILL EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TWO ARRANGEMENTS FIG 1 REPRESENTING A SECTION OF THE FIRST AND FIG 2 OF THE SECOND FIG 1 FIG 2 OB D OJDB UPON MAKING THE EXPERIMENT AS IN FIG 2 WITH THE RODS AND CYLINDER OF THE LAST EXPERIMENT THE RESULT WAS INCREASED TO 31 I ALSO TESTED THE CONCLUSION WITH THE LARGE BATTERY OF TEN CELLS OF FOUR INCHES DIA METER AND OBTAINED FROM SINGLE RODS 10 CUBIC INCHES OF MIXED GASES PER MINUTE AND FROM TWO RODS PLACED AS NEAR TO THE SIDES OF THE CYLINDERS AS POSSIBLE FOURTEEN CUBIC INCHES PER MINUTE THE LAW OF THE EXACT COMPENSATION OF THE GREATER RESISTANCE ARISING FROM THE IN CREASED THICKNESS OF THE ELECTROLYTE BY THE EXTENSION OF THE AREA OF ITS MEAN SECTION IS OF COURSE ONLY MATHEMATICALLY CORRECT WHERE THE INTERIOR WIRE IS INFINITELY SMALL BUT PRACTICALLY THE HALFINCH RODS BEAR SO SMALL A PROPORTION TO THE CYLINDERS WHICH I HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF EMPLOYING THAT THE RESULTS ARE NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THEIR DIMENSIONS WHEN HOWEVER THE INTERIOR CYLINDERS ARE ENLARGED THE THICKNESS OF THE ELECTROLYTE IS DECREASED AND THE AREA OF ITS SECTION INCREASED AT THE SAME TIME AND THE CIRCULATING FORCE RAPIDLY AUGMENTS THE RESULTS ARE EASILY SUBMITTED TO CAL CULATION FIG 3 FIG 4 C 2 INS Z C C1 INCH Z I S 7B 9 TX I M MX S I X I   I I   I I 100 50 0 100 75 50 LET C C FIG 3 REPRESENT A SECTION OF A

MEAN SECTION WILL BE INCREASED TO 75 AND THE THICKNESS OF THE ELECTROLYTE WILL BE DECREASED TO 1 INCH THE FORCE WOULD THEREFORE BE INCREASED IN THE PROPORTION OF 50  75 FOR THE FIRST AND OF 1  2 FOR THE SECOND CONSEQUENTLY COMPOUNDING THE PROPORTIONS THE FORCE CIRCULATING IN THE FIRST ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE TO THAT IN THE SECOND AS 1  3 IN THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS THE CYLINDERS AND RODS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OF EQUAL HEIGHTS WHEN ONE IS SHORTER THAN THE OTHER IT WILL BE OBVIOUS FROM A LITTLE CONSIDE RATION THAT THE DECREASE OF LENGTH IS EQUIVALENT TO AN INCREASE OF DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIG 5   Z

MAY BE TAKEN AS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONED TO THE LENGTHS OF THE RODS IMMERSED IN THEM LET US NOW TURN FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF SIMPLE CIRCUITS AND EXAMINE THE LAW OF A SERIES OR OF COMPOUND CIRCUITS OHMS FORMULA FOR THESE IS NE NRR A IN WHICH N REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF THE SERIES NOW SO LONG AS THE EXTERNAL RESISTANCE R INTERPOSED IN THE CIRCUIT IS MERELY ME TALLIC THE EXPRESSION ACCORDS STRICTLY WITH

FORMULA WILL NOT HOLD UNLESS THE OPPOSITE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE WHICH ARISES FROM THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE ELECTROLYTE AND CONSEQUENT ACCUMULATION OF IONS UPON THE ELECTRODES OF THE DECOMPOSING CELL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THIS IS OF THE SAME NATURE AS THE CONTRARY ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE IN THE CELL WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY POINTED OUT AND DESIGNATED BY E IN THE FORMULA E  B  B  E PROFESSOR WHEATSTONE FROM A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS MADE CONJOINTLY WITH MYSELF WITH MY BATTERY AND PUBLISHED IN MY FIFTH LETTER TO YOU INFERRED THAT IF THIS CONTRARY ELEC TROMOTIVE FORCE BE ASSUMED TO BE CONSTANT AND BE REPRESENTED BY E AND INTRODUCED INTO THE FORMULA THUS EE R R AN TABLES MIGHT BE CALCULATED WHICH WOULD REPRESENT APPROXIMATIVELY THE QUANTITY OF DECOMPOSITION FOR ANY NUMBER OF CELLS OF A GIVEN BATTERY WHILE THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY REGARDING THE VOLTAMETER MERELY AS A RESISTANCE ARE IT IS EVIDENT WIDELY AT VARIANCE WITH THE TRUTH PROFESSOR WHEATSTONE DEVISED THE FOLLOWING SIMPLE MEANS TO DETER MINE ON THIS SUPPOSITION THE VALUES OF THIS CONTRARY ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AND OF THE ADDED RESISTANCE INCLUDING THAT OF THE VOLTAMETER WITHOUT HAVING RECOURSE TO ANY OTHER MEASURING INSTRUMENT THAN THE VOLTAMETER ITSELF TO OBTAIN THE VALUE OF THE CONTRARY ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE HE COMPARED TWO EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH THE RESIST ANCES REMAINED THE SAME WHILE THE SUM OF THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCES ALONE VARIED IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IF THERE EXISTED NO CONTRARY ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE THE MEASURED EFFECT IN THE TWO CASES SHOULD BE SIMPLY AS THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE SERIES EMPLOYED A BATTERY OF FIVE SINGLE CELLS SHOULD HAVE HALF THE POWER OF A BATTERY OF TEN DOUBLE CELLS BUT INSTEAD OF THIS THE EFFECTS MEASURED BY THE VOLTAMETER WERE AS 6  20 10E E 5E E 10  5R   20  6 WHENCE E  2857E    2

ENERGY ARE AMPLY ATTESTED BY CONNECTING THE PLATINUM PLATES OF A VOLTAMNETER WHICH HAS BEEN SOME TIME IN ACTION WITH A GALVANOMETER BUT I PURPOSE TO SHOW THE GENERAL AGREE MENT OF THE AMENDED FORMULA WITH THE RESULTS OF VARIOUS AND MOST TRYING COMBINA TIONS OF DIFFERENT BATTERIES MANY OF WHICH WERE OBTAINED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPI CION OF THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH MIGHT BE DERIVED FROM THEM I SAY GENERAL AGREE MENT FOR THE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED NATURE OF THE ACTIONS TO BE MEASURED SUBJECTED AS THEY WERE TO THE NECESSARILY VARIABLE INFLUENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THEM THE LARGE SCALE UPON WHICH THE EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED ON AND THE ROUGHNESS AND IM PERFECTION OF THE MODES OF MEASUREMENT WOULD NECESSARILY PRECLUDE THE EXPECTATION OF ABSOLUTE ACCURACY THE REMAINDER OF THE EXPERIMENTS ALREADY PUBLISHED IN MY FIFTH LETTER MADE WITH CIRCUITS WHICH CONTAINED AN EQUAL NUMBER IN SERIES BUT IN WHICH THEY WERE COMBINED AS DOUBLE TREBLE QUADRUPLE CELLS C DO NOT FURNISH RE SULTS ACCORDING

MADE WITH A CONSTANT BATTERY COMPOSED OF COPPER CYLINDERS SIX INCHES HIGH 3 INCHES IN DIAMETER CHARGED IN THE USUAL WAY WITH DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND SULPHATE OF COPPER THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE WAS TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF E IN THESE COMBINATIONS IN THE MODIFIED FORMULA BY COMPARING THE RESULTS OF TWO ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE SUMS OF THEELECTROMOTIVE FORCES MIGHT VARY WHILE THE RESISTANCE

DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF R IN THE FORMULA WE MIGHT COMPARE IN A SIMILAR MANNER AS POINTED OUT BY PROFESSOR WHEATSTONE THE RESULTS OF TWO ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCES BEING EQUAL THE RESISTANCES IN THE CELLS ALONE SHOULD VARY AS HOWEVER FROM THE COMPLICATED NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE VARIA BILITY OF DIFFERENT INFLUENTIAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO WHICH I HAVE BEFORE ALLUDED I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAINI TWO PERFECTLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE RESULTS FOR THE COMPARISON I THOUGHT IT ALLOWABLE TO TAKE THE MEAN OF SEVERAL AND FROM THIS I FOUND THAT WITH A VOLTAMETER WHOSE PLATINUM PLATES ARE THREE INCHES IN LENGTH BY ONE INCH IN WIDTH A QUARTER OF AN INCH APART AND CHARGED WITH THE STANDARD DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID SP GR 1126 R  0541 R IN A CONSTANT BATTERY OF THE DIMENSIONS JUST DESCRIBED NOW IF A SINGLE CELL OF SUCH A BATTERY BE TAKEN AND THE CIRCUITS CLOSED BY A SHORT THICK WIRE AND THE ZINC ROD FORMING THE GENERATING PLATE OF THE ARRANGEMENT BE WEIGHED AT INTERVALS OF FIVE MINUTES IT WILL BE FOUND TO LOSE 11 26 GRS FOR EVERY SUCH INTERVAL THIS IS A MEASURE OF THE EFFECTIVE FORCE OF THE CIRCUIT AND ITS EQUIVALENT IN MIXED GASES IS 25 CUBIC INCHES THIS WILL BE TAKEN AS THE UNIT OF WORK IN THE TABLE THAT FOLLOWS I E   I AND THE CALCULATED RESULTS FOR THE DIFFERENT COM BINATIONS WILL IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH COLUMNS BE REPRESENTED IN FRACTIONS OF THIS UNIT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE AMOUNT OF ZINC DISSOLVED IN SUCH A SINGLE CIRCUIT FURNISHES A MEASURE OF THE MAXIMUM WORK THAT ANY NUMBER OF SUCH CELLS COMBINED IN A SINGLE E NE SERIES WOULD BE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING FOR  A AND NI CAN NEVER BE GREATER THAN R HOWEVER GREAT THE VALUE OF N MAY BE SO LONG AS R HAS A POSITIVE VALUE IN OTHER WORDS HOWEVER GREAT THE NUMBER OF CELLS IN A SERIES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS ANY EXTERNAL RESISTANCE IS INTERPOSED THAT THE RESULT SHOULD BE GREATER THAN THAT OF A SINGLE CELL IN WHICH NO EXTERIOR IRESISTANCE IS OPPOSED ALTHOUGH WHEN R IS VERY SMALL WHEN COMPARED WITH N R THE RESULTS MAY BE VIRTUALLY EQUAL IF UNITY BE TAKEN TO REPRESENT THE MAXIMUM WORK THAT ANY SINGLE CIRCUIT CAN PRO DUCE THEN E WILL BE REPRESENTED BY 1 AND R ALSO BY 1 AND E R1 IT IS EVIDENT THAT IN AN EFFECTIVE CIRCUIT R CAN NEVER EQUAL E BUT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF CALCULATION IT MAY BE ASSUMED TO BE SO AND AS ALL THE QUANTITIES IN THE NUME RATOR ARE COMPARED WITH E AND ALL IN THE DENOMINATOR WITH R THE RELATIVE PROPOR TIONS WILL BE EXACT TAKING THE FORMULA NEE NRR IF E  1 AND R  1 THEN E  249 R  0541 SUBSTITUTING DIFFERENT NUMERICAL

WHICH WOULD BE AFFORDED BY ANY COM BINATION OF CELLS TAKEN AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE CALCULATION MAY BE ALSO OBSERVED AS IN THE CASE OF THE TABLE DEDUCED FROM EXPERIMENTS WITH THE SMALLER BATTERY WHEN

THE RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BATTERY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES UPON COMPARING THESE RESULTS WITH THOSE OF THE FORMULA JUST GIVEN THE DISCREPANCIES WERE FOUND TO BE CONSTANT AND CONSIDERABLE SUCH HOWEVER AS MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY SUPPOSING THAT EACH REVERSED CELL INTRODUCED IN ADDITION TO THE REVERSED CURRENT AN EXTRA RESISTANCE UPON SEARCHING FOR THIS RESISTANCE IT WAS PROVED TO EXIST AND ITS CAUSE MANIFESTED BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS TEN SMALL CELLS CHARGED IN THE USUAL MANNER WERE ARRANGED IN SERIES INCLUDING A VOLTAMETER AND AN ADDITIONAL CELL WITH A SIMILAR CHARGE SUBSTITUTING A COPPER ROD IN THE INTERIOR FOR ONE OF ZINC IN FOUR MINUTES SEVEN CUBIC INCHES OF GAS WERE COLLECTED IN THE VOLTAMETER THE ACTION THEN SUDDENLY DECLINED IN INTENSITY AND IN THE NEXT FOUR MINUTES ONLY 34 CUBIC INCHES OF GAS WERE GIVEN OFF UPON EXAMINING THE COPPER ROD IT WAS FOUND COATED WITH A FILM OF OXIDE THIS WAS WIPED OFF AND A BRIGHT METALLIC SURFACE WAS AGAIN EX POSED AND ON ONCE MORE CONNECTING THE BATTERY SEVEN CUBIC INCHES OF GAS WERE GIVEN OFF AS BEFORE IN FOUR MINUTES THE QUANTITY AGAIN DECLINED THIS WAS SEVERAL TIMES REPEATED AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME GENERAL RESULTS IT IS HENCE EVIDENT THAT WHEN COPPER IS MADE THE ZINCODE IN THE SERIES A LAYER OF OXIDE IS DEPOSITED UPON IT WHICH IS NOT IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVED BY THE ACID AND OFFERS A RESISTANCE WHICH WILL VARY ACCORDING TO ITS THICKNESS AND THIS AGAIN WILL MUCH DEPEND UPON THE SIZE OF THE SURFACE 151152 PROFESSOR DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS THIS IS MOREOVER NOT THE ONLY POINT FOR CONSIDERATION FOR IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE HYDROGEN ACCUMULATED UPON THE ZINC OF THE REVERSED CELLS WOULD EXALT ITS ELECTRO NOTIVE FORCE SO THAT  E WOULD BE SOMEWHAT INCREASED AND UPON MILAKING THE CAL CULATION UPON THESE AMENDED DATA

UPON THE AMOUNT OF DECOMPOSITION MAY ALSO BE SUBMITTED TO CALCULATION IN THE SAME WAY THIS INFLUENCE WILL OF COURSE BE MOST PERCEPTIBLE WHEN A SMALL NUMBER OF ELEMENTS PRESENTING A LARGE SURFACE IS EMPLOYED WHEREAS WHEN A NUMEROUS SERIES IS MADE USE OF THE DI MENSIONS OF THE ELECTRODES ARE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE MADE WITH A LARGE VOLTAMETER KINDLY LENT TO ME FOR THE PURPOSE BY MR GASSIOTPROFESSOR DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS WILL PLACE THIS IN A STRIKING POINT OF VIEW THE VOLTAMETER CONSISTED OF FIVE PAIRSOF PLATINUM PLATES EACH FOUR INCHES BY 3 INCHES AT AN AVERAGE DISTANCE OF HALF AN INCH APART THESE WERE SO ARRANGED THAT ANY NUMBER OF THEM MIGHT AT PLEASURE BE CON NECTED WITH A BATTERY 20 CELLS OF THE SMALL BATTERY WERE SO ARRANGED AS TO FORM A SERIES

IN THE FORMULA IT WILL BE FOUND THAT EVERY DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENT MUST HAVE A DISTINCT NUMBER IN SERIES WHICH IT WILL BE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS TO WORK WITH AND THIS NUMBER WILL VARY IN THE SAME ARRANGE MENT WITH THE NATURE OF THE ELECTROLYTE AND ALSO WITH THE SIZE OF THE BATTERY PLATES IT WILL APPEAR FROM CALCULATION THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS COMBINATION IS THAT IN MDCCCXLII X 153PROFESSOR DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS WHICH THE VALUE OF A IN THE FORMULA N E  A MOST NEARLY APPROACHES TO 05 IT WILL THEREFORE VARY EVEN IN BATTERIES OF THE SAME CHEMICAL CONSTRUCTION INCREASING AS R DIMINISHES IN PROPORTION TO R OR IN OTHER WORDS WHEN THE PLATES ARE LARGE A MORE NUMEROUS SERIES IS REQUIRED THAN WHEN SMALL TO PRODUCE THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS RESULTS THIS IS LIKEWISE THE CASE WHEN THE EXTERIOR RESISTANCE IS INCREASED IN BOTH CASES R IS VIRTUALLY DIMINISHED IN RESPECT TO R IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS THAT ALL THE COMPARISONTS HITHERTO MADE BY DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTERS BETWEEN THE GENERAL RELATIVE POWERS OF DIFFERENT BATTERIES ARE FAULTY INASMUCH AS THEY ONLY HOLD GOOD IN THE PARTICULAR CASES TO WHICH THE EX PERIMENTS ARE LIMITED AND ONE BATTERY OF A CERTAIN SIZE MAY BE PREFERABLE FOR ONE KIND OF DECOMPOSITION AND YET MAY ALLOW OF CONSIDERABLE USELESS EXPENDITURE OF POWER WHEN A DIFFERENT ELECTROLYTE IS SUBJECTED TO ITS ACTION AS HOWEVER GREAT STRESS HAS BY SOME BEEN LAID ON COMPARISONS OF THIS KIND IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO GIVE A FEW EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS IN THE FOLLOWING ARRANGEMENTS THE CYLINDRICAL FORM WAS EMPLOYED IN EACH CASE THE PLATINUM CYLINDERS WERE 4

CONSTANT CURRENT OF KNOWN POWER MEASURING THE RETARDING INFLUENCE OF EACH BY ANOTHER VOLTAMETER CHARGED IN THE USUAL WAY WITH DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND INCLUDED IN THE SAME CIRCUIT THE FOLLOWING ARE

VARIES WITH EACH OF THE OTHER SUBSTANCES EMPLOYED IF CHLORIDE OF PLATINUM WERE NOT TOO EXPENSIVE TO ALLOW OF ITS BEING EMPLOYED AS THE EXTERIOR PART OF THE ELECTROLYTE IN CONTACT WITH A PLATINUM CONDUCTING PLATE E OR THE CONTRARY ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE WOULD BE WHOLLY ANNIHILATED AS NOTHING BUT PLATINUM WOULD BE THROWN DOWN UPON THE PLATINUM AND IT WOULD CONSTITUTE THE MOST PERFECT POSSIBLE ARRANGEMENT BUT WOULD NOT MUCH IF ANYTHING EXCEED THE EFFI CIENCY OF NITRIC ACID IN THE NITRIC ACID BATTERY THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE IS NEARLY DOUBLE THAT OF THE SUL PHATE OF COPPER ARRANGEMENT AND CONSEQUENTLY ONE CELL OF THAT CONSTRUCTION IS CAPA BLE OF EFFECTING THE DECOMPOSITION OF DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID IT IS EVIDENT THAT A SIMILAR SERIES OF CALCULATIONS MIGHT BE MADE FOR THIS BATTERY AND

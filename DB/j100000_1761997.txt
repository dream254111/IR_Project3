hyperbola Prof Alfred M Mayer in describing recent work stated that he had succeeded by the use of a lens of ebonite in inflaming various substances by the concentration of dark rays for which ebonite is translucent Dr S H Scudder gave a general account of the cockroach in the past and present Of all insect types this one is best represented in the rocks and especially the older rocks The carboniferous especially may fitly be called the age of cock roaches The paleozoic cockroaches were larger the more recent smaller than the modern Mr G K Gilbert discussed the geological age of the Equus fauna maintaining that it belongs to the upper quaternary later glacial and not to the upper pliocene where it had been assigned by students of vertebrate paleontology THE DATA NOW REQUISITE IN SOLAR INQUIRIES IN order to obtain the greatest amount of assist ance from observations of the eclipsed sun it is necessary to consider in the most general way the condition of solar inquiry at the time the ob servations are made If any special work com mends itself to those interested in the problem  work which may be likely to enable us to empha size or reject existing ideas  then that work should take precedence of all other Next if the observers are sufficient in number to undertake other work besides this then that work should be arranged in harmony with pre vious observations that is the old methods of work should be exactly followed or they should be expanded so that a new series of observations may be begun in the light and in extension of the old ones In my opinion and I only give it for what it is worth the three burning questions at the present time  questions on which information is required in order that various forms of work may be undertaken to best advantage besides eclipse work  are these  1 The true constitution of the atmosphere of the sun By this I mean are the various series of lines of the same element observed in sunspots eg limited to a certain stratum each lower stra tum being hotter and therefore simpler in its spectrum than the one overlying it and do some of these strata with their special spectra exist high in the solar atmosphere so that the Fraunhofer lines represented in the spectrum of any one substance are the result of an integration of the YVCJ T VOL VII No 169 various absorptions from the highest stratum to the bottom one This view is sharply opposed to the other which affirms that the absorption of the Fraunhofer lines is due to one unique layer at the base of the atmosphere I pointed out before the eclipse of 1882 that crucial observations could be made during any eclipse including the time both before and after totality I made the observations they entirely supported the first view but I do not expect solar inquirers to throw overboard their own views until these observations of mine are con firmed and I think one of the most important pieces of work to be done during the next eclipse is to see whether these observations can be de pended upon or not One observer I think should repeat the work over the same limited region of the spectrum near F another observer should be told off to make similar observations in another part of the spectrum I have prepared a map of the lines near E for this purpose showing those brigh tened on the passage from the arc to the spark and those visible alone at the temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame Whereas some of the spark lines will be seen seven minutes before and after totality as short bright lines some of the others will be seen as thin long lines just before and after totality We want to know whether the lines seen at the temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame will be seen at all and if so to what height they extend 2 The second point to which I attach impor tance is one which can perhaps be left to a large extent to local observers if the proper apparatus which may cost very little be taken out With this eclipse in view I have for the last several months gone over all the recorded in formation and have discussed the photographs taken at the various eclipses in connection with the spots observed especially at those times The simple corona observed at a minimum with a considerable equatorial extension 12 diameters according to Langley the complex corona ob served at maximum when the spots have been located at latitudes less than 20 have driven me to the view which I shall expand on another occasion that there is a flattened ring round the suns equator probably extending far beyond the true atmosphere that in this ring are collected the products of condensation and that it is from the surfaces of this ring chiefly that the fall of spotforming material takes place If we take any streamer in midlatitude we find that while the spots may occur on the equatorial side of it none are seen on the pole ward side I regard the streamers therefore like yAPRIL 30 1886 SCIE the metallic prominences as a sequel to the spot and there is evidence to suggest that a careful study will enable us to see by what process the reaction of the photosphere and underlying gases produced by the fall of spotmaterial tends to miake the spotmaterial discharge itself in lower and lower latitudes as the temperature of the suns lower atmosphere gets enormously increased The observations of Professors Newcomb and Langley at the minimum of 1878 on the equa torial extension are among the most remarkable Professor Newcomb hid the moon and 12 of arc around it at the moment of totality by a disk of wood carefully shielding his eyes before totality Professor Langley observed at a very considerable elevation It is therefore quite easy to under stand why this ring has not been seen or photo graphed at maximum At maximum no pre cautions have been taken to shield the eye no observations have been made at a considerable elevation while the fact that the ring if it exists consists of cool material fully explains how it is that the photographic plates have dis regarded it I would propose therefore that the repetition of Professor Newcombs observations of 1878 be made an important part in the arrangements of the eclipse for this year A slight alteration in the method will be necessary as the ring will be near the vertex and the lowest point of the eclipsed sun 3 Another point of the highest importance at the present moment has relation to the existence of carbon Until Tacchinis observations of 1883 the only trace of carbon in the solar spectrum conlsisted of ultraviolet flutings He observed other flutings in the green near the streamers in the eclipse referred to Duners recent work puts it beyond all doubt that stars of class III b have their visible ab sorption produced chiefly by carbon vapor On any theory of evolution therefore we must expect the suns atmosphere to be composed to a large extent of carbon at some time or other so that the highest interest attaches to this question in connection with the height in the atmosphere at which the evidence of carbon is observed The existence of the ultraviolet flutings among the Fraunhofer lines tells nothing absolute about this height although I inferred at the time I made the announcement that it existed at some height in the coronal atmosphere These three points then are those to which I attach special importance at the present time We next come to photographs of the corona I believe that with our present knowledge the chief thing we have to seek in such photographs KVCYE 387 is not merely the streamers and their outlines which we are sure to get anyway but images on a larger scale so that in a series of short expo sures we may endeavor to get some records which will eventually help us in determining the direc tions of the lower currents At present we do not know absolutely whether these flow to or from the poles My own impression is that the panaches at the poles indicate an upper outflow In coming to the photospectroscopic observa tions I am of opinion that of the two attacks which I first suggested for the eclipse of 1875 and which have also been used in the last two eclipses of 1882 and 1883 one of them should be discarded and the whole effort concentrated on the other We have learned very much from the use of the prismatic camera one of the instruments referred to but the results obtained by it are not of sufficient accuracy to enable them to be fully utilized On the other hand though the slit spectroscope failed in 1875 it succeeded with a brighter corona and more rapid plates in 1882 and with a proper reference spectrum every iota of the facts recorded can be at once utilized for laboratory work and subsequent discussion On these grounds then I would suggest that slit spectroscopes alone be used for photographic registration I think falling plates should be used and that the work should begin ten minutes before totality and continue till ten minutes after  provided the slit be tangential or nearly so to the limb I may state that arrangements have been made here to take such a series of photographs on the uneclipsed sun and with the improved appara tus I am greatly in hopes that we may get some thing worth having J NORMAN LOCKYER DEEPSEA SOUNDINGS IN THE ATLANTIC THE U S S Enterprise Commander Barker during her recent passage from Montevideo to Barbadoes and from thence to New York made a series of deepsea soundings through the Atlantic Oceans which add considerably to our knowledge of the depths of those seas Seventytwo casts were taken between Montevideo and Barbadoes the distance run being 5031 miles After leaving Montevideo the course of the Enterprise was laid to the northward towards Nelson shoal where a depth of 2088 fathoms of water was found instead of 19 fathoms as ap pears on all the charts of that locality Com mander Barker says  From this point I steamed slowly running from 200 to 250 miles to the north ward of the Challengers line taking casts at

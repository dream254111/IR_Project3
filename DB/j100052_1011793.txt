J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011793,CLOSER COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH LATINAMERICA,I242616,CLOSER COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA BY BERNARD N BAKER BALTIMORE MD THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRIES OF LATINAMERICA MIGHT BE OFFERED THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION OF POLICY FOR OUR COUNTRY TO PURSUE IS THE SECURING OF THE CONFIDENCE OF OUR SISTER REPUBLICS IN THE SOUTH BY CARRYING OUT IN SPIRIT AS WELL AS IN LETTER ANY AGREEMENTS OR TREATIES WE MAY MAKE WITH THEM OR WITH OTHER NATIONS IN THIS CONNECTION IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE ACTION OF OUR GOVERNMENT IN ACQUIRING FROM THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA THE RIGHT TO BUILD THE PANAMA CANAL WAS NOT ABOVE REPROACH AT THE TIME WE TOOK OVER THROUGH PURCHASE FROM THE FRENCH COMPANY THE RIGHTS THAT BELONGED TO THEM THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION BUT THAT WE ENCOURAGED THE CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA TO SECEDE FROM THE UNITED STATES OF COLOMBIA SO THAT WE MIGHT SECURE THROUGH TREATY WITH THE NEW REPUBLIC THE RIGHTS NECESSARY TO ENABLE US TO CARRY FORWARD THE GREAT WORK OF BUILDING THE PANAMA CANAL ALTHOUGH THE UNDERTAK ING AND PUTTING THROUGH OF THE CANAL WAS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE THE WAY IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED IS NOT AN EPISODE OF WHICH WE SHOULD BE TOO PROUD LOOKED AT FROM THE BROADEST ASPECT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS OUR ACTION WAS NOT ABOVE CRITICISM COLOMBIA WAS UNJUST AND UNREASONABLE AND EXPECTED TO SECURE FROM THE UNITED STATES UNDUE ADVANTAGES AND COMPENSATION BUT THIS DID NOT JUSTIFY US IN ACQUIRING PRACTICALLY BY FORCE THROUGH OUR SUPERIOR RESOURCES WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY TREATY AGREE MENT WE SHOULD NOW SEEK TO ESTABLISH CLOSER COMMERCIAL RELA TIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF CON CEDING TO IT SOME ADVANTAGES IN THE USE OF THE PANAMA CANAL SUCH AS INCLUDING ITS COASTWISE COMMERCE AS WE DO THAT OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA IN THE FREE USE OF THE CANAL FOR COLOMBIA LIKEWISE HAS A LARGE COAST LINE ON BOTH THE PACIFIC AND ATLANTIC OCEANS BY TREATING COLOMBIA IN THIS MAGNANIMOUS SPIRIT WE WOULD LEAD THE OTHER LATINAMERICAN REPUBLICS TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN ALWAYS DEPEND ON THE FAIRNESS AND JUSTNESS OF OUR COUNTRY SECOND WE ENTERED INTO A TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN IN GOOD 738CLOSER COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH LATINAMERICA FAITH THAT NO CONCESSIONS WOULD BE MADE IN THE USE OF THE PANAMA CANAL TO THE SHIPS OF ANY NATION THAT WERE NOT EQUALLY EXTENDED TO THE SHIPS OF ALL NATIONS THIS IMPLIED CERTAINLY ON OUR PART A MORAL OBLIGATION THAT IN THE FOREIGN COMMERCE OF THE WORLD AND OUR OWN INCLUDED WE WOULD TAKE NO UNDUE ADVANTAGE OF OUR RIGHTS IN THE PANAMA CANAL THIS CLAUSE IN OUR TREATY WAS A MISTAKE THE UNITED STATES IN SPENDING THE MILLIONS NECESSARY TO BUILD THIS CANAL SHOULD HAVE AS REGARDS ITS FOREIGN COMMERCE SOME ADVANTAGES BECAUSE OF THIS ENORMOUS EXPENDITURE IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE CANAL WILL EVER BE PROFITABLE DIRECTLY FROM TOLLS OR PAY ANYTHING LIKE A FAIR PER CENT UPON THIS ENORMOUS COSTAT LEAST FOR A GREAT MANY YEARS TO COME A NUMBER OF BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS TO GIVE FREE TOLLS TO SHIPS UNDER OUR OWN FLAG ENGAGED IN FOREIGN COMMERCE WE HAVE A PERFECT RIGHT TO GIVE FREE TOLLS TO SHIPS ENGAGED IN OUR COASTWISE COMMERCE BUT EVERYONE MUST CONCEDE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD DO NOTHING WHICH MIGHT IN ANY WAY BE CONSTRUED AS A VIOLATION OF THIS TREATY AGREEMENT WE SHOULD THEREFORE DISCUSS THE MATTER FRANKLY WITH ENGLAND BEFORE WE TAKE ANY ACTION OF THAT KIND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BY SO DOING WE MIGHT SECURE A MODIFICATION OF AN UNFORTUNATE AGREEMENT AND THUS OBTAIN RELIEF WITHOUT ANY ARBITRARY ACTION THE CONFIDENCE WHICH OUR SISTER REPUBLICS HAVE IN OUR INTEGRITY WOULD BE STRENGTHENED BY SUCH ACTION AND THEY WOULD BE WILLING IN THE FUTURE TO TRUST US MORE EXTENSIVELY THIRD A MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOP MENT OF CLOSER COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WILL BE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH REGULAR LINES OF COMMUNICATION IN STEAMSHIPS UNDER OUR OWN FLAG AS WILL CARRY TO THE PORTS OF SOUTH AMERICA SOME EVIDENCE UPON WHICH TO BASE A BELIEF THAT WE ARE A MARITIME AND EXPORTING NATION I KNOW IN SOME OF THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTH AMERICA THEY DO NOT BELIEVE WE CAN BUILD AND RUN SHIPS THEY THINK THAT WE ARE NOT A MARITIME NATION OTHER NATIONS SUCH AS JAPAN COME TO THEM AND SHOW THEM BY ACTUAL DEMONSTRATION IN THE PORTS OF THEIR COUNTRY SHIPS BUILT OWNED AND MANNED BY THE JAPANESE UNDER THE JAPANESE FLAG I ALLUDE NOW PARTICULARLY TO PORTS ON THE WEST COAST THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE OF ALL PORTS ON THE EASTERN COAST WHERE SELDOM IF EVER IS THE AMERICAN FLAG SEEN ON A SHIP OF OUR COUNTRY CONSE QUENTLY IT IS HARD FOR THE NATIONS OF SOUTH AMERICA TO REALIZE THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN BUILD SHIPS 739 I6ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FOURTH THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OF BANKING FACILITIES THROUGHOUT OUR LATINAMERICAN REPUBLICS WILL BE OF INESTIMABLE BENEFIT THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF COURSE FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO TAKE UP BUT IT IS A QUESTION THAT I THINK WILL BE VERY LARGELY INFLUENCED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT ON WHATEVER LINES ARE FAIR AND JUST OF REGULAR STEAMSHIP COMMUNICATION UNDER THE FLAG OF OUR COUNTRY FIFTH TODAY THE CONDITIONS EXISTING IN MEXICO AFFORD US A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE EVILS THAT MAY ARISE FROM A LACK OF PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THE CONDITIONS THAT GO TO MAKE UP CLOSER RELA TIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO FOR MANY YEARS HAS OFFERED OPPORTUNITIES AND COMPLETE PROTECTION TO CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES WISHING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS COUNTRY AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL HAS BEEN INVESTED IN MEXICO IN MANY CASES WITH VERY BENEFICIAL RESULTS TO THE CITIZENS OF BOTH COUNTRIES AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE ENTIRELY NEGLECTED MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BY REGULAR LINES OF STEAMERS UNDER OUR OWN FLAG AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT WE FIND ANOTHER NATION JAPAN STUDYING OUT HOW SHE MAY WISELY AND EFFICIENTLY DEVELOP CLOSER COM MERCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO BY ESTABLISHING LINES OF STEAMERS UNDER HER OWN FLAG A GREAT DEAL OF THE PRESENT DISCUSSION IN THE PRESS HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LINES OF STEAMERS UNDER THE JAPANESE FLAG AT SALINA CRUZ AND A CONCESSION BY THE MEXICAN GOV ERNMENT TO THIS LINE OF 5000 A VOYAGE MEXICO HAS GIVEN TO AN AMERICAN STEAMSHIP LINE THE AMERICANHAWAIIAN STEAMSHIP COM PANY A SPECIAL GUARANTEE AGAINST LOSS FOR A LINE ACROSS THE ISTHMUS OF TEHUANTEPEC THUS WE SEE THE REMARKABLE SITUATION OF AN AMERICAN LINE OF STEAMERS RECEIVING AID FROM THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND ALSO A JAPANESE LINE WHOSE INTERESTS ARE SO DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO OUR OWN PARTICULARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PACIFIC COAST TRADE THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SO ENCOURAGE OUR MERCHANT MARINE AS TO OBVIATE THE NEED OF ESTABLISHING THESE CLOSE RELATIONS WITH JAPAN WERE THERE FACILITIES UNDER THE AMERICAN FLAG THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO WOULD BE GLAD TO EXTEND TO US INSTEAD OF EXTENDING TO JAPAN SUCH ASSISTANCE AND THUS DRAW CLOSER OUR COMMERCIAL RELATIONS THERE IS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE BELIEF THAT REGULAR LINES OF COM MUNICATION WITH LATINAMERICA BY STEAMERS UNDER OUR OWN FLAG 740 I62CLOSER COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH LATINAMERICA WOULD DEVELOP CLOSER RELATIONS IN THIS CONNECTION THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN HIS MESSAGE OF DECEMBER I9O9 SPOKE AS FOLLOWS I EARNESTLY RECOMMEND TO CONGRESS THE CONSIDERATION AND PAS SAGE OF A SHIP SUBSIDY BILL LOOKING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LINES BETWEEN OUR ATLANTIC SEAPORTS AND THE EAST AND WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA AS WELL AS LINES FROM THE WEST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES TO SOUTH AMERICA PRESIDENTS MCKINLEY AND ROOSEVELT BOTH RECOMMENDED SUCH LEGISLATION AS DID ALSO POSTMASTERS GENERAL CORTELYOU MEYER AND HITCHCOCK SECRETARIES OF COMMERCE AND LABOR CORTELYOU STRAUS METCALF AND NAGEL ALSO ADMIRAL DEWEY PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL BOARD OF THE NAVY DEPARTMENT OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THE NATIONAL BOARD OF TRADE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS THE AMER ICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN COTTON MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION AND THE BOARDS OF TRADE AND CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE OF THE PRINCIPAL CITIES OF THE UNITED STATES BY ADOPTING RESOLUTIONS THEY ENDEAVORED TO ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULAR AMER ICAN LINES OF MAIL STEAMERS TO SOUTH AMERICA AS TO FOREIGN COUN TRIES AND ESPECIALLY VIA THE PANAMA CANAL SPAIN HAS PROVIDED BY LAW FOR COMPENSATION OF I90 A MILE FOR STEAMERS OF THIRTEEN KNOTS FROM BARCELONA TO THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA AND TO SAN FRANCISCO THROUGH THE CANAL WHEN COMPLETED A BILL IS PENDING IN THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT FOR A SIMILAR COMPENSATION JAPAN HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED A LINE TO THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA I SHOULD LIKE TO QUOTE THE FOLLOWING REPORT OF MR C J ARNELL A SUBSIDY OF 6905II YEN ANNUALLY FOR FIVE YEARS IS PROVIDED FOR A JAPANESE LINE TO SOUTH AMERICA THERE ARE TO BE SIX VOYAGES A YEAR SO THE SUBSIDY AMOUNTS TO 57000 A ROUND VOYAGE OF 2500O MILES OR AS NEAR AS MAY BE 460 PER NAUTICAL MILE OUTWARD BOUND THIS IS THE RATE PAID TO TWENTY KNOT MAIL STEAMSHIPS OF 80OO TONS OR OVER UNDER OUR OCEAN MAIL ACT OF I891 THE JAPANESE SHIPS HOWEVER ARE TO BE ONLY THIRTEEN KNOTS AND RANGE FROM 5200 TO 9300 TONS IN HIS ADMIRABLE REPORT ON THE JAPANESE LEGISLATION OF IO99 S DOC 152 6IST CONG IST SESS MR C J ARNELL OF OUR EMBASSY AT TOKYO SAYS OF THIS SOUTH AMERICAN LINE THE GOVERNMENTS PROPOSAL TO OPEN A REGULAR LINE TO SOUTH AMERICA MET WITH SEVERE OPPOSITION IN THE DIET AND CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM FROM THE PRESS ON THE GENERAL GROUNDS THAT IT WAS CONTRARY TO THE NEW POLICY OF FINAN 741 I63THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CIAL RETRENCHMENT TO SUBSIDIZE AN ENTERPRISE WHOSE IMMEDIATE UNDER TAKING WAS NOT ESSENTIAL AND WHICH DID NOT PROMISE TO BE PROFITABLE FOR SOME YEARS TO COME AS ALREADY REPORTED HOWEVER THE GOVERN MENT SEEMED TO ATTRIBUTE MORE THAN ORDINARY IMPORTANCE TO THE LINE AND AFTER VIGOROUS ACTION SUCCEEDED IN EFFECTING A COMPROMISE WITH THE DIET WHEREBY THE SUBSIDY FOR THE PRESENT YEAR ABOUT 500000 YEN WAS RETAINED IN THE BUDGET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE HOWEVER TO SHOW THAT THE MOTIVE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LINE IS MORE THAN PURELY COMMERCIAL AND THE GENERAL OPINION SEEMS TO BE THAT IT IS THE OUTCOME OF INVESTIGATIONS RECENTLY MADE IN SOUTH AMERICA BY MR UCHIDA DIRECTOR OF THE COMMERCIAL MARINE BUREAU THE IMMEDIATE SUBSIDIZING OF THE LINE WAS EVIDENTLY DESIRED IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN WHAT IS BELIEVED TO BE A PROMISING FIELDTHE PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULAR STEAMSHIP SERVICES BY THE HAMBURGAMER ICAN NORDDEUTSCHERLLOYD AND A CERTAIN CHINESE COMPANY THE NEW JAPANESE LINE WILL MAKE REGULAR CALLS AT HONGKONG MOJI KOBE YOKOHAMA HONOLULU SALINA CRUZ AND MAZANILLO MEXICO CALLAO PERU AND IQUIQUE AND VALPARAISO CHILE ON OCTOBER 25 I909 A BILL WAS PASSED IN THE MEXICAN CON GRESS TO GRANT FROM THE MEXICAN TREASURY TO THIS JAPANESE LINE A SUBSIDY OF IOOOO PESOS 5000 A VOYAGE OR 60000 ANNUALLY FOR FOURTEEN KNOT STEAMERS TO ARGENTINA ONCE A MONTH SPAIN IS WILLING TO APPROPRIATE AT THE RATE OF 460 A NAUTICAL MILE OUTWARD THE SAME RATE AS FOR SIXTEEN KNOT AMERICAN STEAMSHIPS DEFEATED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LAST MARCH THE RECENT SUBSIDY LEGISLATION OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN FACT SHOWS THAT VARIOUS SHIPPING PROPOSITIONS WHICH HAVE PASSED THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS AND FAILED IN THE HOUSE HAVE BEEN STUDIED ELSEWHERE AND THAT SOME OF THEIR FEATURES ADAPTED TO VARYING NATIONAL CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE LAWS OF OTHER COUN TRIES SPAIN HAS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR A SUBSIDIZED LINE THROUGH THE PANAMA CANAL SO IMPORTANT DOES THIS QUESTION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LINES OF STEAMERS UNDER THE FLAGS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRIES APPEAR TO FOREIGN NATIONS THAT TODAY THEY ARE SPENDING OVER 490O0000 PER ANNUM FOR THIS PURPOSE WE ARE DOING LITTLE OR NOTHING WITH THE LATINAMERICAN COUNTRIES WHERE THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY TODAY EXISTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EXPORT BUSINESS 742 164

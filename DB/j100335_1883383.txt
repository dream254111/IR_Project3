Zealand Parliament who voted for the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894 imagined that by so doing he was voting to take away from employers and employees the power to contract freely in their industrial relations Nothing in the discussions in Parliament indicates that this was the intention of the framer of the measure or of its supporters One of the latter Mr John Macgregor probably one of the bestinformed men in Parliament at that time said six years after the passage of the Act that he was driven by candour to admit that the system is not in any sense what it purports and was intended to be  a means of settling industrial disputes and strikes by conciliation and arbitration  but is rather 404REGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 405 a system for the regulation of the industries of the Colony by means of ordinances misnamed  awards  issued by a court of law To say that the system of compulsory arbitration is not what it was intended to be is not to condemn it as Mr Macgregor admits2 We must study the actual workings of the system see what it has accomplished and decide whether these results however unexpected they have been are worth the cost of the undertaking measuring costs not in money alone but also in the ef fects which judicial interference has shown on industrial and social welfare No subject with which the boards or councils of con ciliation or the court of arbitration has had to deal is so important as that of wages Nothing is so likely to cause a strike or a lockout as a disagreement between employees and their employer over the wages which are to be paid and the mode and time of payment To prevent strikes or lockouts the court has had to fix such wages in the different industries or industrial establishments as would in its judgment do justice to both employers and employees and thus avoid the necessity of an appeal to these crude modes of settle ment Hence the judicial regulation of wages has come to be the most important feature of the compulsory arbitration system If wages are to be regulated by the courts under the arbitration system it becomes a matter of fundamental importance to know what principle or theory of wages will be adopted by the judges who make the regulations I J Macgregor Industrial Arbitration in New Zealand Dunedin 1903 prefatory note 2 Ibid p 9  I do not say the act has been a failure What I do say is that if it is a success it is not as that which it was intended to be but assomething quite different406 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Will the competitive principle of fixing the price of labor according to the number of laborers in any given occu pation and the demand for their services be adopted  Will the principle of collective bargaining be recognized and an effort made to take into account the strength of the opposing forces  Will the needs of the industry or the needs of the workers be made paramount  The original act was silent in regard to the principle of wage payment and could therefore afford no guidance in this matter to either the boards or the court Wages are merely mentioned in section 2 as one of the  indus trial matters  which might be made a subject of an industrial agreement between employers and employees or which in the absence of such an agreement might give rise to an industrial dispute to be heard on appli cation by a board of conciliation or by the court of arbitration It may be said in passing that when an industrial dispute is heard by a board or council of conciliation there is no need of a statement of the principle on which wages are to be fixed The conciliation method is by its very nature a giveandtake method Any attempt to lay down a principle to be followed by the partici pants in conciliation in reference to wages or any other matter coming before them would defeat the very pur pose of these conferences Since conciliation implies an ultimate agreement between parties hitherto unable to agree it is important that every opportunity be afforded for them to compromise their differences Such a com promise would be unlikely if the disputants had to make a wage agreement on the basis of some principle not acceptable to both parties In the New Zealand conciliation councils as in the Australian wages boards wages are adjusted in accordance with no set principle Both sides make use of such arguments for or against anREGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 407 increase of wages as are likely under the circumstances to carry weight with their opponents and nothing is conceded by either side which is not necessary to prevent the conference from being a failure A court of arbitration on the other hand finds the need of some guiding principle when it faces the task of fixing the rate of wages in an industry or occupation in such a way as to avoid the necessity of a strike Finding no guidance in the words of the statute the New Zealand judges as well as those in Australia have had to decide for themselves the principle which they would follow The Australian judges have usually stated definitely the principle which they intended to follow and have discussed their reason for adopting it with much fulness In the published awards of the New Zealand Arbitration Court on the other hand we find little discussion of the basic principles of the award Pioneers in a new field of industrial regulation the New Zealand judges have proceeded with caution and mind ful of the effects which their awards would have upon the conduct of industry have hesitated to announce the adoption of a principle of wage payment which later experience would prove unwise or impracticable In the very first cases heard by the New Zealand Court no statement was made as to the principle which was being followed but the Court limited itself to the establishment of a minimum wage for workers in the industry as a whole or more likely a minimum which varied according to the occupation or to the nature of the work to be performed This practice received legislative approval in 1898 when by an amendment to the Arbitration Act Parliament authorized the Court to prescribe a minimum rate of wages or other remu neration with special provisions for a lower rate being fixed in the case of any worker who is unable to earn the prescribed minimum408 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS The practice of the Court in establishing this mini mum wage does not appear to have been uniform in the early cases decided Mr Broadhead says  Some of the questions put by the members of the Court to witnesses would appear to show that the minimum wage is sometimes at any rate fixed according to what is reckoned as the average wage ruling in the trade I In the case of the Canterbury bootmakers heard and decided in 1896 the Court accepted a schedule of wages and piece rates contained in a tentative industrial agreement drawn up by the employers and employees Furthermore it created a general board of conciliation composed of employers and employees in the trade to meet annually for the purpose of dealing with all ques tions of wages which was directly authorized  to alter the amount of the minimum wage 2 Local boards of conciliation in this industry were also provided for  to arrange all matters of wages not already provided for by the general board The plan adopted in this case of referring questions of wages to private boards of conciliation was not allowed to become a precedent however In fact the Court soon modified this very award by abolishing the private boards3 Since then the Court has itself prescribed the minimum wage to be paid altho in those cases where an elaborate schedule of piece rates had to be prepared it has usually asked the assistance of a committee of employers and employees in the trade 1 Broadhead State Regulation of Labour in New Zealand Christchurch 1908 p 57 2 Awards Recommendations Agreements etc made under the Industrial Con ciliation and Arbitration Act of New Zealand vol 1 p 205 2 Clark  Labor Conditions in New Zealand Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Labor No 49 November 1903 vol viii p 1205REGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 409 II In the absence of any clear enunciation of the prin ciple which guided the Court in the determination of the minimum wage during the early years we may say that a study of the awards themselves and especially of the brief comments which sometimes accompany them indicates that for several years the Court was chiefly concerned with the problem of preserving the existing industrial conditions in the Colony and was unwilling to allow such changes in wage rates as would tend to embarrass employers in the conduct of their businesses Indeed this was practically so stated by Mr Justice Williams the first president of the Arbitration Court who wrote to the London Times as follows The duty of the Court is to pronounce such an award as will enable the particular trade to be carried on and not to impose such con ditions as would make it better for the employer to close his works or for the workmen to cease working than to conform to them It was doubtless in line with this policy that the Court decided in 1896 in a goldmining case where the opera tors had reduced wages that while the reduction of wages was premature  looking to the large amount of money that was being expended by the Consolidated Goldfields Company in prospecting and opening up new ground these being nonpaying operations the miners should consent to take a lower wage for a limited period after which it should be permitted to reopen the whole question 2 When on the expiration of the period stated the question of wages was reopened altho a more detailed schedule of wages was adopted by the Court no advance in wages was allowed to the class of workers dealt with in the earlier cased I Quoted by Broadhead op cit p 57 2 Awards etc vol 1 p 178 a Ibid  p 183410 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Of a similar tenor was the decision of the Court in an important case heard in 1901 which affected the en tire Thames goldmining district In announcing the decision of the Court not to allow any advance in the wages paid the President of the Court Mr Justice Cooper said We ae satisfied that the goldmining industry in this industrial district is notwithstanding an increased output of gold from the Waihi mine in a languishing and depressed condition The Court is not in our opinion justified in so increasing the rate of wages as to destroy or in a great measure cripple an industry upon which so many workers now depend for their livelihood and in which so many individuals have invested their money The workers had urged an increase in the cost of living as a reason why higher wages should be paid but the Court found that while some articles had increased in price during the preceding eighteen months the evi dence submitted seemed to point to the conclusion that on the whole the cost of living was substantially the same as it had been eighteen months before The emphasis placed upon considerations affecting the prosperity of the industry was not confined to mining In several cases dealing with manufacturing industries which were heard by the Court in 1902 the same attitude was taken as that shown above In the case of the Auckland Iron and Brass Moulders the Court refused an increase in the minimum wage is 1 Id per hour fixed by an award made in 1899 The President Cooper said At the hearing before us it was clearly proved that the condition of the trade at present was no better than it was in July 1899 Indeed the effect of the evidence is to satisfy us that the trade is if anything in a less prosperous condition than it was then The union has therefore failed to establish a case justifying the Court in increasing the minimum wage fixed in 18992 1 Awards etc Vol ui p 24 2 Ibid p 89REGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 411 In the case of the Wellington bookbinders the Court called attention to the low margin on which the em ployers were operating owing to importations and said We have felt that any material additional burden or restriction placed upon manufacturers here will imperil the industry altogether and that the effect will be not to give more work to local journeymen at higher wages but to compel additional importations and to go far to destroy an industry which at the present time affords employ ment to a considerable number of workers who are not technically journeymen Outside competition was also found to prevail in the cycle manufacture and the Court said it was obliged to take it into consideration  in fixing the mini mum wage of adult workers and in considering the employment and apprenticeship of youths 2 The case however which better than any other illustrates the consideration which the Court gave during the early years to the interests of the employers is that of the Canterbury Woolen Mills Employees in which an award was made in 1902 The workers asked the Court to substitute for the existing piece rate system a system of weekly wages at certain rates stated in their petition After calling attention to the fact that such a change would involve an increase of wages to the amount of 11000 on an existing payroll of 25000 per annum the Court said that a careful examination of the wage sheets the conditions of work and the earnings of the piece workers had satisfied it that no real cause for complaint exists and that these workers are well treated and well paid under the present system In dealing with an industry of this description we have to consider the interests of the industry as a whole It it is to be successfully conducted 2 Awards etc  vol rn p 349 Cf Clark op cit  p 1239 2 Awards etc vol iii p 554412 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS reasonable provision has to be made for the maintenance of the machinery and plant under everchanging conditions and while it is the duty of the Court to see that the workers are reasonably and fairly paid for their labor the Court has also a duty to perform to the employer and to see that the conditions imposed are not such as to seriously imperil the existence of the industry and so produce results which would be disastrous to the employers to the workers and to the district Being satisfied therefore that the workers generally are fairly paid under the present piecework rates and conditions it is the duty of the Court to maintain as far as possible the present conditions And in this present dispute the Court must take into consideration the fact that the production of these mills have to be sold in competition with those of the other woolen mills in the other industrial districts No dispute exists in reference to these mills nor has the Court any power to make one award applying to the mills in the other parts of the Colony It would be manifestly unjust for the Court to impose conditions on the Canterbury mills which would seriously hamper their business and power to fairly compete with the other woolen mills in the Colony The inclination of the Court in its earlier decisions to emphasize the lack of prosperity of an industry when ever it refused an increase of wages led the workers not unnaturally to believe that the profits being obtained by certain establishments might properly be urged as a reason why increases of wages should be allowed Mr Justice Cooper the judge who made most use of the prosperityoftheindustry argument unwittingly lent color to this belief by a statement made by him in connection with a hearing of the Tanners and Fell mongers dispute at Christchurch in 1901 He said to the employers  It is quite clear that a good deal of the information upon which the union must necessarily rely to base a claim for higher wages is in possession of the other side and that is the profits you are making on your business 2 This statement was followed by a request that the employers furnish him with copies of their balance I Awards etc vol iu p 507 2 Broadhead op cit p 58REGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 413 sheets or other information necessary to enable the Court to tell what profits they were making It does not appear however that any use was made of this information or that the books were actually called for and inspected Any expectation that the workers may have had that under the Courts interpretation of the purposes of the act they might expect to share in the profits of success ful concerns was doomed to disappointment It was Mr Justice Cooper himself who first repudiated such an interpretation of his own decisions In the Thames goldmining dispute already referred to the miners employed by the Waihi mining companies claimed an increase of wages on the basis of the large profits being obtained by those companies The Court held the reason given to be insufficient and said The fact that two or three companies in the district are obtaining good returns and therefore that the rate of wages should be based upon the profits made by the companies affords in our opinion no sound reason for fixing a high rate of wages in a district where the great majority of mines are not obtaining payable returns2 Much criticism of this award was expressed by the workers and their sympathizers but even more dissatis faction was felt concerning a similar decision rendered in 1906 in a case brought by the Dunedin seamen against their employer the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand This company and other New Zealand ship I Broadhead op cit pp 5859 2 Awards etc vol lu p 25 In 1907 the Court allowed an

in order to make out a case before the Court the industrial union of workers which had been defeated in the former case had now split into two unions  The effect of this division he said  was to enable them to single out practically the only dividendpaying company in the district  ibid p 384414 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS ping companies had in 1893 reduced the wages of their seamen ten shillings per month owing to the bad times Ever since that time the employees had been endeavor ing without success to have their wages restored to the old level Failing to secure the increase by the volun tary action of the company they had recourse to the Arbitration Court As the case was presented to the Court much emphasis was placed by the employees on the prosperity of the Union Company In rendering a decision adverse to the claim of the employees Mr Justice Chapman said The majority of the Court do not think that any substantially dif ferent circumstances are shown to have arisen since the last award justifying an increase of wages Evidence was given as to the pros perity of the Union Steamship Company the chief employer in the Colony Such evidence is usually admitted by the Court as part of the general inquiry but the Court does not settle the wages on a profitsharing basis as that might in many industries involve the necessity of fixing a differential rate as between employers and would certainly lead to confusion The disappointment felt by the seamen over this award and the opinion of the Court was shared by many others Even the Secretary of Labour Mr Edward Tregear felt warranted in making it the subject of comment in his next annual report He said  The sailors took the view that if they did not get an increase during days of prosperity but only suffered reductions in hard times the position was unfair 2 A perusal of the above quotations from the opinions of the Arbitration Court giving reasons for refusing increases of wages on the ground that the prosperity of the industries concerned did not warrant such increases would naturally lead the reader to suppose that during the early years of the enforcement of the Conciliation I Awards etc vol vn p 60 2 Report of the New Zealand Department of Labour 1906 p viREGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 415 and Arbitration Act increases of wages were generally refused by the Court Such a conclusion however would be erroneous The general tendency during the early years of the Act was to advance wages and this tendency is noticeable in the awards of the Arbi tration Court as well as in the findings of the boards of conciliation Mr Ernest Aves reviewing the operation of the Act for the first twelve years of its history in his report to the British government gives a list of sixtyfour cases in which more than one award had been made in the same trade and in which increased wages or shorter hours generally had been allowed On the other hand there were only fortynine cases in which more than one award had been made and in which wages and hours had been left unaltered  In the whole series of awards he goes on to say  there has been only one insignificant case where wages have been reduced and two where hours have been increased 2 Altho the advances made by the Court in those cases where an increase of wages was allowed were in most cases not considerable they nevertheless do relieve the Court from the imputation that during the early years of its existence the workers who applied to the Court for an improvement in their situation generally went away emptyhanded In addition to the cases enumerated by Mr Aves where more than one award had been made by the Court he reported that up to March 31 1907 there were one hundred and fifteen cases in which only one award had been made3 It is doubtless well within the truth to say that in the majority of these cases the minimum wage fixed by the Court was some 1 Report to the Secretary of State for the Home Department on the Wages Boards and Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Acts of Australia and New Zealand London 1908 pp 9498 2 Ibid p 99 3 Ibid  p 98416 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS what above that which some of the workers in the trade in question had been receiving Altho the early decisions of the Court of Arbitration granting increases in wages seldom state the reasons which impelled the Court in allowing the increases the period was one of slowly rising prices and it soon became evident to the workers that arguments based on the increased cost of living were most likely to carry weight with the Court Perhaps such arguments exercised more influence than the facts warranted for as we shall later see the increase in the cost of living was much less in New Zealand than in other parts of the world but the statistics which showed this to be so had not yet been collected and tabulated and popular opinion was influenced by reports from Europe and America The Court of Arbitration in New Zealand has never directly declared it to be its intention to measure the wages by the cost of living of the workers The purpose of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was to prevent strikes not as in the case of the wages boards legis lation of Australia to prevent  sweating The first workers to take advantage of this Act were therefore not those in the unorganized and poorly paid trades but those already organized in strong trade unions It was not to be supposed that the disputes originated by this class of workers and carried to the Court of Arbi tration would have to do with wages insufficient to cover the cost of subsistence An award of the Court which allowed wages only sufficient to cover the cost of living would not serve to settle a dispute between a wellorganized union of skilled workers and their employers and therefore in the early awards made by the Court no effort was made to establish a standard minimum wage based on the cost of living to the unskilled worker The principle which governed theREGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 417 Court says Dr Clark was  to include in the award such terms as would probably have been included in a collective bargain between the parties thereto in case they had come to an extrajudicial agreement Such a wage was fixed as would be in the opinion of the Court a fair wage or a ruling wage in the locality in which the decision applies III As time went on several considerations led the Court of Arbitration in New Zealand to place more emphasis upon the cost of living as a standard by which to measure changes in the minimum wage established by the Court 1 Applications for awards became more numerous from industrial unions representing less highly skilled and poorer paid workers While the minimum wage in the case of the highly skilled workers bore no obvious relation to the cost of living of the workers for the unskilled and for women workers it would be the duty of the Court to see that the minimum wage established by the Court was high enough to enable the worker to maintain a decent standard of living 2 As most of the applications for awards came from the workers unions and as a demand for an increase of wages was invariably a part of such applications the Court naturally threw upon the applicants the burden of showing that an increase was necessary This was especially true in the case of second or subsequent awards made by the Court to the same group of workers When the Court has once made an award fixing the minimum rate of wages for a given trade and the workers upon the expiration of that award ask for an I Clark op cit p 1205418 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS increase of wages it is natural that the Court should demand the reason for altering the minimum wage It is equally natural that in a period of rising prices the workers should plead an increase in the cost of living as a reason for their demands and if they are able to show that an increase in house rents and in the prices of such commodities as are usually purchased by them has taken place since the last award was made it will be very difficult for employers to make a successful resistance before the Court to the demand on the part of their employees for an increase in the minimum wage 3 Cost of living was early made use of by judges of Australian courts of arbitration as a basis for the minimum wage Altho New Zealand judges were in no way bound to follow these precedents the argu ments by which the Australian judges defended their awards especially the argument of Mr Justice Higgins of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the Har vester case in which he laid down the principle that a fair and reasonable wage was one which provided for the normal needs of the average employee regarded as a human being living in a civilized community were widely quoted in New Zealand and undoubtedly exercised influence in the Arbitration Court Altho cost of living may have been one of the factors involved in the wage determinations of the earliest awards it is first mentioned in connection with an award made as late as 1902 The case was that of the Auck land carters and it was Mr Justice Cooper who rendered the decision He said In fixing the minimum wage we have had regard to the cost of living in Auckland the nature of the work to be performed for the wages fixed and the rates already fixed in other centers We believe 1 Ex parte H V McCay 2 Commonwealth Arbitration Reports p 1REGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 419 that the rates we have settled for Auckland are compared with the cost of living in the cities of Wellington and Dunedin where awards have already been made fair and reasonable and justified by the evidence adduced before us in the case The extent to which the Court would go in requiring proof of an increase in the cost of living of the workers before it would allow an increase of wages is well brought out in a decision made in 1905 after hearing a dispute brought by the miners of the Westland district On this occasion Mr Justice Chapman the President of the Court said In the latest awards made by the Court it has refused either to increase or decrease the wages on the evidence then brought forward We have been asked to deal with the question upon evidence put forward by the various parties As to this evidence it is sufficient for present purposes to say that it did not tend to show a general increase in the cost of living during the last few years and in this respect it stands in marked contrast with evidence which we have received in other parts of New Zealand At Reefton it was shown that there is no increase either in houserent or board In the case of the coal mines we do not think that the evidence tended to show that the established tonnage rates lead to substantially different results in the way of remuneration from those which the Court had before it in making the former awards2 The reference in the above quotation to the unsatis factory evidence which laborers were likely to offer to the Court to show that there had been an increase in the cost of living clearly indicates one reason why the New Zealand Court of Arbitration during the early years of its existence placed so little emphasis on cost of living as a principle for determining the minimum wage The evidence offered by the workers was for the most part personal  price quotations made from memory relative to the commodities which they had purchased or the rents paid for their houses Such evi dence could easily be matched by employers quoting 1 Awards etc vol m p 82 2 Ibid vol vi p 33420 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS instances of reductions which had taken place in prices and rents so that as more than one judge remarked the evidence taken in toto tended to furnish no proof as to what changes if any had taken place in the cost of living The New Zealand government made no extended study of the cost of living until 1912 But after the census of 1906 was taken a comparison was made of the changes in wages and of changes in the prices of food since 1895 the year the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act went into effect The year 1906 was made the basis of the index numbers used Later the figures were made to include the year 1907 The index numbers were as follows Year Wages Prices of Food 1895 848 843 1896 843 861 1897 846 861 1898 887 874 1899 880 836 1900 904 860 1901 897 896 1902 934 1056 1903 965 1005 1904 986 985 1905 980 1020 1906 1000 1000 1907 1049 1033 Except for a general upward tendency on the part of both wages and prices it cannot be said that these figures indicate that any close relationship existed between wages and prices in New Zealand during these years The fluctuations in one column seem to be independent of those in the other It is probably true however that taking the period as a whole wages kept pace with prices of food better in New Zealand than they I New Zealand Official YearBook 1908 p 540REGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 421 did in Europe and America It is doubtful however whether the awards of the Court of Arbitration can be said to have been in any large degree responsible for this parallel movement The wage statistics from which the above index numbers were calculated included the wages of agricultural and pastoral laborers and domestic servants practically none of whom was covered by court awards Some slight effect of the awards may perhaps be seen in the fact that wages in manufacturing occupations increased 19 per cent between 1895 and 1905 whereas wages in general increased only 155 per cent during these years Greater use was made of cost of living as a principle for determining the minimum wage by Mr Justice Sim who became President of the Court of Arbitration in 1907 than by any of his predecessors The reasons for this were presumably the following 1 The majority of the awards made during the first ten or twelve years of the operation of the Act had as we have observed allowed some increase in the wages of the workers After a time however it was found that conditions within an industry and the competition which it had to meet made it unwise to make further increases of wages unless it could be established by sufficient evidence that changes in the cost of living threatened to reduce the standard of living of the workers 2 The influence of the reasoning of Mr Justice Higgins in the Harvester and other cases which we have already mentioned In a conversation with the writer in 1911 Mr Justice Sim acknowledged that Mr Jus tice Higgins had expounded more fully than had anyone else the doctrine of a living wage and said that he was in thoro agreement with the latters exposition of the subject 1 New Zealand Official YearBook 1908 p 540422 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS The first important case in which Mr Justice Sim expressed his opinion concerning the relation which should exist between wages and the cost of living was that of the Gisborne painters heard in May 1909 The workers had asked for an increase of wages beyond that allowed them by an award of the Court made in 1905 In denying this request Mr Justice Sim said The union asked to have the minimum wage for painters increased from is 3d to 1s 41d per hour on the ground that the cost of living in Gisborne had increased since the last award was made So far from this being established the evidence went to show that the cost of a number of the necessaries of life was actually less than in 1905 Taking the case therefore as presented by the parties at the hearing if any alteration were to be made in the minimum wage it should be a reduction instead of an increase Altho this threat of a decrease of wages was not carried out the Court let the workers know in no uncertain language that they need expect no advances in wages unless they were able to bring proof of their necessity The judge continued Much expense and disappointment will be avoided if the executives of unions will ponder well what we have said and if before originat ing a dispute they will ascertain that there is some definite and reasonable ground for asking for an alteration in the terms of an existing award and will recognize that without some such ground it is useless to ask for any alteration It is idle to ask as many unions do for an increase in the wages fixed by an existing award and to have nothing better to offer in support of the application than the evidence of a number of workers who are prepared to say that in their opinion the wages asked for are reasonable To rely on evidence of that kind is to confess that the union has been unable to find anything in the shape of fact or argument to support its case2 This decision was very unfavorably received by unionists throughout New Zealand It seemed to them to be practically equivalent to saying that under com pulsory arbitration there was little hope of laborers improving their position They were asked to abandon  Awards etc vol x p 191 2 Ibid p 192REGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 423 the use of the strike and to accept in place thereof the awards of the Court If now these awards granted increases of wages only when the applicants were able to prove that the increases were necessary to maintain real wages at the existing level it was obvious that the Arbitration Court was not to be an instrument for bringing about a better distribution of wealth It is due to Mr Justice Sim to say that he recognized fully the force of this criticism In the conversation which the writer had with him the judge said that he did not see how the Conciliation and Arbitration Act could be made an effective instrument for bringing about a better distribution of wealth The Act assumed the continuance of the wage system The Court he thought could not do more than establish a minimum wage and he believed it was the intention of Parliament to establish by means of this minimum wage a level below which the competition of employers was not to be allowed to reduce wages Any attempt to bring about a better distribution of wealth must be made outside the sphere of the Court and by such means as profit sharing cooperative production socialism In harmony with its policy of requiring unions asking for higher wages to submit evidence tending to show the need of an increase the Court in August 1908 refused to fix a minimum wage for general farm laborers in the Canterbury district because the applicant union failed to furnish evidence to show that the majority of the workers were dissatisfied with existing wages The difficulties in the way of fixing a satisfactory minimum for the thousands of workers in an industry like farming were such that the Court held that it was not practicable to make an award fixing the hours of work and wages for general farm hands without altering seriously the conditions under which farming is now carried on I Awards etc vol ix p 526424 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS It might seem from this statement that the Court had put the prosperity of the industry above the welfare of the workers but this the Court did not admit Mr Justice Sim said If a strong case had been made out for interference the Court might have been compelled to make an award on the subject and to attempt to regulate the hours of work and wages of general farm hands Such a case however has not been made out and the Court is thus relieved from the necessity of making the perilous attempt to regulate by award the whole farming industry of the Dominion1 According to the evidence given in this case a large portion perhaps 90 per cent of the farm laborers lived with their employers who furnished them with board and lodging  The question of a livingwage there fore said the Court  does not arise in connection with this class of workers 2 The question did arise in connection with the day workers and the Court admitted its obligation to consider the claims of these workers The evidence submitted tended to show that a large number of the farmers pay their daylaborers 7s per day and upwards while others pay only 6s per day and some as low as 5s per day We think that anything less than 7s per day is not a livingwage where the worker has to maintain a wife and children andthat so far as the daylaborer is concerned a case has been made out for the interference of the Court In ordinary circumstances the Court would make an award dealing with this case The day laborers form however only a small fraction of the workers em ployed by farmers and we are not justified in bringing seven or eight thousand farmers under the operation of an award for the sake of benefitting a small number of daylaborers who are paid less than 7s per day3 Somewhat naively the Court made a  recommenda tion  that farmers pay their daylaborers not less than 7s per day and dismissed the case feeling assured that I Awards etc vol ix p 526  Ibid p 522 3 Ibid pp

application of the hotel and restaurant employees in private hotels and boarding houses in Christchurch The Court held that it was impracticable to classify the boarding houses in such a way as to fix varying scales of wages and that to require all to pay the same wages would drive some of them out of business Mr Justice Sim speaking for the majority of the Court declared that Even if they could afford to pay increased wages there is no reason why they should be compelled to do so Where as in the present case the workers concerned are provided with board and lodging and are paid a wage sufficient to furnish them with all other neces saries of life there can be no question of a livingwage and except in special circumstances the Court ought not to attempt to regulate the wages of such workers2 Mr McCullough the representative of the employees in the Court entered a vigorous protest to this decision declaring that the Court in refusing to make an award has made it possible for employers to sweat and underpay a very large and deserving number of young men and women3 A decision which at first blush seems to be contradic tory to that just considered was reached only a few months later in the case of the RotoRua tourist accommodation and boarding houses where an award was made fixing minimum wages for the various grades of employees and also fixing the hours of work The Court itself called attention to the fact that an award had been refused in the case of the Christchurch board ing houses but it noted the following differences I Awards etc vol ix pp 52728 2 Ibid vol

their business under similar conditions Hence it was possible for the Court to make an award and the evidence presented to the Court showed the need of some regulation of especially the hours of work The award was limited in its application to the parties mentioned and was not to apply to most parties keeping private hotels and boarding houses Other cases might be mentioned in which the Court has refused the demands of the workers for higher wages and has referred to its opinion in the Gisborne case concerning the tendency of the workers to submit their cases without proper evidence While the Court of Arbitration in New Zealand has not discussed at length in connection with its published awards the principles which have governed its mem bers in fixing the minimum wage as the Australian courts have done Mr Justice Sim in the abovemen tioned interview with the writer stated informally the principle on which the Court proceeded in estab lishing a minimum wage and the methods by which this was accomplished In later interviews Messrs Scott and McCullough the representatives of the employers and of the employees in the Court confirmed the correctness of this statement According to the statement made by Mr Justice Sim the underlying principle of the minimum wage as it was fixed by the New Zealand Court was that of a living wage to the unskilled worker In the absence of any

NEW ZEALAND 427 sufficient to guarantee a living wage to workers in unskilled occupations Just what these eight shillings were supposed to cover was not stated As in most occupations not more than fortyeight hours a week were worked this meant for unskilled workers such as builders laborers carters general laborers in metal working establishments unskilled workers in quarries weekly earnings of from fortyfive to fortyeight shil lings a week To this minimum wage of Is an hour which in the opinion of the Court constituted a living wage it was the custom of the Court to allow from 3d to 4 d per hour in addition as the minimum wage for skilled workers the amount of the addition depending in part on the number of hours worked per week and in part on the degree of skill required in the trade The intention seems to have been to fix a minimum wage of about 3 per week for skilled workers in most trades These rates were awarded by the Court even when laborers presented no reliable evidence as to their needs If higher wages were demanded the burden of proof as we have already stated was placed by the Court upon the workers to show why higher rates of pay should be allowed Such evidence as was presented said the judge was usually fragmentary in character arising out of the individual experiences of the men and was so incomplete and contradictory that the Court could make little use of it If the Labour Department or other governmental agency he continued would gather and tabulate statistics which showed what changes in wages and cost of living were taking place the Court of Arbitration would attach much importance to such evidence He also spoke approvingly of the sugges tion which had been made by Sir John Findlay at that time AttorneyGeneral that a permanent commission be appointed to study these changes and report on them regularly428 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Both the decisions of the Court and the statements made by the members of the Court show plainly that no attempt to determine what was the cost of living in order to use it as a basis for fixing the minimum wage had been made in New Zealand prior to 1912 The Court had apparently not even conducted such inquiries as were being made at this time in Australia by Mr Justice Higgins prior to the awards made in his court Instead of endeavoring to ascertain these costs the New Zealand Court had in large measure stereotyped its award wages by its insistence on 8s a day as the minimum wage Not even the employees represen tative on the Court seems to have objected to the lack of flexibility which this method of fixing the minimum wage involved His only contention at least as he expressed it to the writer was that the minimum wage should be lOs rather than 8s per day Altho a rigid minimum wage was fixed by the Court during these years one should not fail to mention the fact that it was not the expectation of the Court that employers would pay the minimum wage to all the workers of the class to which it applied nor does the evidence gathered by the Department of Labour con cerning the actual wages paid indicate that such was the practice This is a matter however which must be reserved for later treatment IV By the beginning of the year 1912 the members of the Court of Arbitration seem to have become convinced that some concessions to the laborers in the way of slight additions to their wages would have to be made Whether the Court reached this conclusion on the basis of evidence furnished by the workers or felt that generalREGULATION OF WAGES IN NEW ZEALAND 429 information concerning the upward tendency of prices was sufficient to warrant these increases of wages is not ascertainable from the published awards A Com mission on the Cost of Living in New Zealand was appointed this year by sanction of Parliament and made its report on August 30 1912 but the tendency on the part of the Court to allow increases of wages had already begun before the Commission made its report A survey of the wages paid to common laborers in the building trades will show this tendency Owing to its high rents Wellington is generally con sidered to be the most expensive place among the cities of New Zealand for laborers to live In 1907 the Court had fixed is 1ad per hour for a week of not to exceed fortyfive hours as the minimum rate to be paid to laborers in Wellington

Wellington and the Poverty Bay district forty seven hours were fixed as the length of the working week In 1908 the Court had fixed the minimum wage for builders laborers in the Wellington district

Court made in connection with the case was to call attention to the fact that the wages had been increased2 It should be said however that this new award applied only to certain incorporated towns in the district Napier Hastings and Wanganui and to the country roundabout Elsewhere in the district the former award continued in force Especial attention has been given to the wages of builders laborers because they well represent the class of workers to whom the minimum wage is intended to apply It is also possible to follow the awards for this class of workers through a series of years without being disturbed by the thought that they may not always represent the same grade of workers Other workers had their wages increased by the awards of the Court at about the same time In connec tion with an award made to the Wanganui drivers in October 1912 mention was made of the fact that the Court had been allowing an increase of wages for drivers generally throughout the Dominion  In the city of Wellington the increase is is per week In Auckland Christchurch and Dunedin the increase is 4s per week I Butchers wages at Auckland were increased at about the same time4 On the other hand

of their members the Court declared it would have made provision for them if the Association had placed before the Court sufficient information to enable an award to be made Where the Court is asked for the first time to regulate the wages and conditions in connection with any particular branch of industry it is necessary for the appli cant to put before the Court fully and fairly the conditions in that particular branch In November 1912 the Court in connection with an award made to employees of the Gisborne Freezing Works openly announced its policy with reference to the minimum wage for unskilled laborers The union had asked for a considerable increase of wages over those granted in 1910 when unskilled laborers had been allowed is an hour and most of the skilled laborers had been granted is 3d per hour The men now requested a minimum wage of is 3d per hour for the unskilled laborers The basis for this demand was cer tain agreements recently entered into with the meat companies at Wellington Wanganui Masterton and Patea These agreements were made during a period of industrial unrest and strikes were threatened unless the demands made by the workers were met Under these circumstances the Court came to the conclusion that the agreements which had been entered into were more or less forced and did not represent the normal demand for labor It therefore fixed the minimum wage for the unskilled laborers at the Gisborne Works at is 1Nd per hour and in doing so took occasion to speak of the abovementioned agreements as follows Under these agreements the lowest wage to be paid for unskilled labour of any kind is Is 3d per hour and the wages to be paid to 1 Awards etc vol xiii p 794432 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS the other workers are based on this as a minimum The highest wage fixed by the Court for general unskilled labour is is 14d per hour and awards with this as a minimum have been made recently in the Wellington and Taranaki districts In the opinion of the Court it would not be justified in treating Is 3d per hour as the proper minimum for unskilled labour and the award now made is based on is Wd per hour as the minimum for that class of labour The Court is in the habit of giving great weight to agreements made by the parties to an industrial dispute when it is clear that these agreements have been made voluntarily and that employers admit that the wages fixed thereby are fair remuneration for the work in question We are not satisfied however that the agree ments relied on in this case are of this character There was no information before the Court from the companies concerned as to the circumstances in which the agreements were made but it is difficult to believe that the companies would have agreed volun tarily to fix is 3d per hour as a minimum for unskilled labour and there is ground for suspecting that the agreements must have been obtained by pressure which the companies were unable to resist The admission by the Court that is 12d was a proper minimum wage for unskilled labor with 3d additional for skilled labor shows that the higher cost of living or other conditions were regarded as a justifi cation for a general advance in the minimum rates of pay over those which Mr Justice Sim and Mr Scott believed to be adequate a year before That the Court did not feel itself bound to take the market price of labor as a basis for a minimum wage is illustrated by the case of the Dunedin plasterers who in 1913 asked to have is 9d per hour fixed as a mini mum wage for their occupation The Court only allowed Is 6d per hour and said The fact that plasterers in Dunedin are able at present to obtain a wage of 14s or 15s per day is not of itself a valid reason for fixing Is 9d per hour as a minimum and no other reason was suggested for the proposed alteration2 Probably one reason for this decision was a feeling on the part of the Court that conditions in the building I Awards etc vol xlii pp 90304 2 Ibid vol xiv p

normal times The upward tendency of wages continued throughout the year 1913 In September of that year builders and contractors laborers were awarded a minimum wage of is 2d per hour which was Ud more than the Court had hitherto allowed for this kind of work This same allowance appears in the awards made to general laborers in other industries during the year That the Court was not acting in an extravagant manner or in opposition to public opinion in allowing this advance in wages is indicated by the fact that general laborers in Petone a suburb of Wellington had a minimum wage of is 3d per hour for a fortyfour hour week granted to them at about this time by the borough council as a result of an industrial agreement2 V If it be conceded as an established fact that within recent years cost of living has been the factor having most influence with the Court in the determination of the minimum wage it is important to ascertain how closely the wages awarded by the Court have followed

represented by the number 103 a rise of only five points In Europe the increase was much greater for these years Sauerbecks index numbers arranged on the same basis showed a rise from 96 in 1894 to 118 in 19101 The increase in New Zealand had been almost entirely due to the change in the prices of farm products whose index numbers had changed from 98 in 1894 to 127 in 1910 Nonfarm products on the other hand had fallen four points or from 98 to 942 The Commission appointed to investigate and report on the cost of living in New Zealand in 1912 took the McIlraith figures as its starting point but supplemented this study with information gained from other sources The index of wholesale prices of foodstuffs as reported by the Commission showed  a rise of 20 per cent between the triennal period 189496 and the year 1911 with the rise more marked after 1901 than before3 Retail prices in Auckland including not only food but other commodities and house rents showed a slightly higher rate

the size of the average family since the beginning of the period and the higher average income of the period must have tended to diminish the proportion which food is of the total expen diture and therefore to reduce the real rise to a little below that figure Early in 1914 the New Zealand Government Statis tician Mr Malcolm Fraser began the systematic collection of retail price statistics of foodstuffs and also the statistics of house rents in the four leading cities of New Zealand Auckland Wellington Christchurch and Dunedin Index numbers weighted according to total consumption and based on the average annual expenditures in the four chief cities were prepared The average for the fiveyear period 190913 was taken as the base which was expressed as 1000 Prices were collected for every year as far back as 1891 except at Christchurch where no grocery figures were available back of 1899 Separate indices were prepared for each of the three food groups groceries meats and dairy produce and also for house rent and an index number for all groups combined was also prepared For the food groups no perceptible and steady rise in the prices is to be noted until the year 1905 since when a general upward tendency is noticeable The rise in house rents is noticeable throughout the whole period Taking the index numbers for the combined groups and for all four cities we find a rise from 875 in 1899 to 1079 in 19142 equivalent to 234 per cent No corre sponding index number for wages has been prepared and it is impossible to make an accurate and scientific comparison of the movements of prices and wages in New Zealand during these later years We have already 1 Report of Commission on Cost of Living p xcix 2 Journal of the Department of Labour June 1916 p 492436 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS observed 1 that wages advanced about as rapidly as did the prices of food prior to 1907 We are not interested in this place however in the movement of wages in general but in the changes in the minimum wages established by the Court of Arbitra tion Altho the Court did not put cost of living in the foreground as a reason for advancing wages during the early years of its existence it seems probable that the gains which labor secured from the Court in the way of increased wages during these years were fully as great as the increase in the prices of those things which the laborer had to purchase The minimum wage awarded by the Court is seldom so stated as to enable percent ages to be calculated which would show the advances in wages from time to time At times the classification of the workers differs at other times the age or experi ence of the worker enters in to help fix the minimum Many of the awards take the form of a schedule of piece rates Sometimes the wages will be fixed in one award by the day in subsequent awards by the hour while in still other cases the size of the district covered by the award is different from that covered by the pre vious awards in the same occupation A comparison of the minimum wage fixed at different times for the same class of workers given for several occupations or industries may serve as evidence in support of the writers belief that for some years the advance in award wages was probably at least as considerable as the increase in the cost of living during these years Bootmakers throughout New Zealand received a

most phenomenal gain the minimum wage established in 1897 varied from 12s 6d to 17s 6d per week while in the year 1904 it was fixed at 25s Builders and general laborers who represent fairly well the unskilled class had their mini mum wage fixed in Canterbury in 1900 at from 42s to 48s per week and in 1906 at from 44s to 49s 6d per week In all the above cases unless otherwise specified the number of hours remained the same under the different awards During the early years of Mr Justice Sims tenure as President of the Court of Arbitration there was a ten dency already noted to refuse further advances in wages unless the workers could prove the need of such increases and this they could seldom do to the satis faction of the Court In the absence of any official statistics showing the direction and extent of changes in the cost of living the Court felt that the evidence presented was likely to be selfcontradictory Indeed it is doubtful if there was any considerable change in the level of prices in New Zealand during the years 1907 to 1911 inclusive The Mcllraith index numbers 2 of wholesale prices and those of retail prices subsequently I All the above figures are taken from the Aves Report pp 9498 2 Op cit  pp 6269438 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS prepared by the Government Statistician  indicate little change during these years Beginning with 1912 however the advance in general retail prices and in house rents was marked and continued steadily there after The average index numbers for the four leading cities taken together were 984 for 1911 1013 for 1912 1037 for 1913 and 1079 for 19142 How far the Court of Arbitration was influenced by the McIlraith figures published toward the end of 1911 and by the Report of the Commission on Cost of Living and how far by the evidence presented in Court does not appear from the comments published in con nection with the Courts awards Some influence was present for as we have already shown beginning early in 1912 the Court allowed considerable increases in the minimum wage to unskilled labor while it continued generally the 3d to 4Wd differential in favor of the skilled laborers The general practice during 1912 and 1913 was to grant an addition of ld per hour to both skilled and unskilled laborers over and above the wages allowed in the awards of 1911 This preserved the existing differential between the classes Occasionally the advance to unskilled labor was as much as 2d per hour Inasmuch as the general rule in 1911 and even earlier had been to allow is an hour to the unskilled laborers the advances made in 1912 and 1913 amounted to from 12 to 161 per cent which was doubtless suffi cient to cover the average increase in the cost of living for the laborers family 1 New Zealand Official YearBook

This was a longer period of service than that of any of his predecessors His place was taken by Mr Justice Stringer the present President of the Court No immediate change in the policy of the Court as regards the minimum wage was noticeable Indeed the new president early announced it as his intention to follow the rule laid down by his predecessor in regard to wages In connection with an award made to plumbers and gasfitters throughout the Dominion in March 1914 a minimum wage of is 6d per hour was fixed for registered plumbers and is 5d for those unregistered The Court felt it necessary to explain the increase of wages which had been allowed as follows We have thought it proper to offer some inducements to workers to qualify themselves for the higher branches of the industry and we have therefore differentiated between the registered and the unregistered plumber awarding the wages of Is 6d per hour to the former and Is 5d per hour to the latter The wage of Is 5d is con ceded on the basis of the voluntary agreement on the part of the master plumbers of Auckland to pay that rate If the agreement had not been made we should probably have fixed the wage of the unregistered plumber at Is 4d that being the rate arrived at by the Court after consideration of many cases extending over some years as the reasonable minimum wage for skilled workers which was to remain until it was satisfactorily established that the con ditions of the trade had so altered as to render some modification desirable and proper This statement by the Court was practically equiva lent to an announcement to employers that they need not concede to their skilled workers either by means of an industrial agreement or through the medium of the 1 Awards etc vol xv p 156440 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Conciliation Councils more than is 41d an hour as a minimum wage because the Court would support them in such a stand Furthermore the awards of the Court since that time show a determination to adhere to the ls 41d rate The minimum wage for men employed as pressers or in other capacities in the tailoring trade at Auckland at weekly rates was fixed at 3 per week  to bring them into something like conformity with the other skilled trades I The last award made in this industry in this same occupation had established 2 lOs per week as the minimum wage for this class of work2 A new timber workers award made in the northern district in May 1914 readjusted wages of all classes of workers generally allowing 9s per day to those workers who had received 7s 6d 8s or 8s 6d per day by the award of April 1911 and allowing correspond ingly higher wages to the men who had been awarded 9s or more per day by the award of 19113 These changes also were said to have been made for the pur pose of bringing the wages  in conformity with the minimum rate of wages ruling in other industries for the lower paid workers 4 Among recent awards I where the is 41d rate per hour has been fixed as a minimum for skilled workers may be mentioned those made to the boiler makers engineers boat builders picture framers and wire mattress makers flour mill employees and the canister workers All these awards were made in 1915 In the case of certain seasonal trades such as the building trades or where certain exceptional conditions prevailed the minimum rate for skilled workers has been made as high

1914 and 1915 seems to have been to maintain the is 1 Id hourly rate in most trades using this grade of labor Occa sionally the rate has been made is 2d or in Welling ton is 3d3 In some of the recent awards the Court while refusing to raise the minimum wage for skilled laborers because of industrial conditions due to the war has felt itself under the necessity of granting some increase to the lowestpaid laborers Thus in the case of the Canter bury metal workers assistants heard in June 1915 the Court made some increase in wages and said Although the Court was unable to increase the higher wages being paid to the skilled workers in the engineering trade it has felt that the lowerpaid assistants in that trade were entitled to some increase having regard to the fact that their minimum wages have remained stationary for some years while on the other hand cost of living during the same period has materially increased4 The minimum rates for the laborers were made d per hour less than the rates fixed a few months before at Wellington presumably because of the differences in house rents in the two places In the case of the Wellington flax mills employees heard in August 1915 the Court decided that industrial conditions due to the war made it inexpedient to raise the wages of the skilled workers In the case of the unskilled however the Court said The minimum wage fixed by the

other parts of the Dominion as the increase is granted owing to the excep tionally high rents which workers in this district have to pay for suitable dwelling houses  4 Ibid p 337442 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS reasonable livingwage and this the Court has substantially in creased altho it has not brought it up to the rate generally fixed for unskilled labour in other industries The lowerpaid shop assistants in the Wellington retail softgoods trade received an increase in the mini mum wages in September 1915 altho for the trade in general the Court thought it an inopportune time to make any substantial change in wages paid since the trade will inevitably be prejudicially affected by the lessened spending power of the people consequent upon the increased taxation which will have to be imposed to meet the heavy charges upon the Dominion in connection with the war2 A similar policy was followed in the case of the Welling ton Stationary and Traction Engine Drivers3 While these recent awards show that the interests of the lowerpaid workers have not been neglected by the Court the increases of wages allowed have been in considerable and have probably not been more than the workers if organized could have secured without the aid of the Court Indeed in some instances they have been less as is shown by the results of several industrial agreements recently made The Court in its awards has adhered pretty closely to the is 1ad rate for an hours work in the case of unskilled labor Occasionally it has allowed is 2d and in the city of Wellington is 3d On the other hand the Auckland Builders Con tractors and Industrial Workers Union has recently secured by means of an industrial agreement a minimum wage of is 3ad per hour4 and the general laborers employed by the

Dominion2 which according to Mr Fraser represents a rise of 2431 per cent in the typical household budget of the working class3 Mr Justice Sim had said that the Court of Arbitration would attach much importance to statistics collected by the Government showing the trend in the cost of living but it does not appear that the Court under the presidency of his successor made much use of such evi dence during the years 191415 Possibly the Court feared to make a change in the rates of wages while the war was in progress because the advance could not be sustained when the war closed Viewing the matter from this distance and frankly admitting our ignorance of the conditions disclosed at the hearings of the cases which have arisen it does not appear what justification if any there has been for the failure on the part of the Court to advance the minimum wage both for skilled and for unskilled labor since the outbreak of the war While the war has undoubtedly disturbed the normal operations of business New Zealand is said to be enjoy ing unusual prosperity due largely to the unusual de mands for her products in the countries engaged in war Greater steadiness of employment has doubtless come to the rescue of the worker and may have prevented a lowering in his standard of living even with a steady advance in retail prices But if this is the explanation of the Courts failure to advance the minimum wage it means that according to that tribunal the employing classes alone are to keep all the gains that come from a rise of prices 1 Journal of the Department of Labour May 1916 p 269 2 Ibid

following conclusions 1 The Court having little or no guidance from Parliament has limited its work in regulating wages to prescribing a minimum wage for a given class of workers usually distinguishing between the skilled and the unskilled in each industry or occupation but making no effort to determine the exact wages to be paid to those workers who are worth more than the minimum 2 During the early years of its existence the Court made no statement of the principles according to which the minimum wage was determined but while allowing many increases of wages it seemed inclined prior to 1907 to give chief consideration to the ability of the industry to support increases of wages under the existing competitive conditions 3 While giving such consideration to the profits earned by an employer as tend to show his ability to stand increases of wages the Court has steadfastly refused to fix wages on a profitsharing basis 4 Altho cost of living was not taken as a principle for determining wages prior to 1907 wages seem to have kept pace with advances in the prices of food prior to that date 5 Cost of living was definitely adopted as the prin ciple for determining the minimum wage in 1907 and thereafter The Court adopted a standard minimum wage of one shilling per hour for unskilled labor and fixed the minimum wage for skilled workers at from 3d to 41d above this amount The burden of proof to446 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS show that a higher minimum was needed was placed by the Court upon the laborers 6 Cost of living increased very little in New Zealand between 1907 and 1911 and during these years few changes were made in the minimum rates fixed by the Court at the beginning of this period 7 A rapid increase in the prices of food and in house rents took place during the years 1912 and 1913 and the Court advanced the minimum wages of both skilled and unskilled workers to keep pace with the increase in the cost of living 8 The advance of prices continued during the years 1914 and 1915 and this upward movement was greatly accelerated by the war The Court of Arbitration apparently because of war conditions allowed few increases of wages and they applied almost exclusively to the unskilled workers during these years M B HAMMOND OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY

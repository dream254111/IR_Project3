GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NORTH CAROLINA A LIKE ACT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE YEAR 1790 AND THE INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT CONTEMPLATED IN THE CHARTER WAS UNDER238 10 V IRGINIA LAW REGISTER JULY TAKEN COMPLETED AND PUIT INTO OPERATION THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT BUT THAT THE CANAL LOCKS CAUSEWAYS AND OTHER WOIRKS OF THE DISMAL SWAMP COMPANY SO LONG AS THEY SHOULD REMAIN THE PROPERTY OF THAT COMPANY WERE ENTIRELY FREE FROM THE IMPOSITION OF ANY TAX BY THE STATE OF VIRGINIA IT APPEARS FROM THE FACTS HOWEVER THAT IN THE YEAR 1867 A DECD OF TRUST WAS EXECUTED UPON ALL THE PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY AND THAT THIS DEED OF TRUST WAS FORECLOSED IN 1880 AND CONVEYANCE MADE TO CERTAIN PURCHASERS WHO ASSUMED THE COR PORATE NAME OF THE DISMAL SWAMP CANAL COMPANY THIS CANAL COMPANV NO 2 IN TURN EXECUITED A DEED OF TRUST UPON ALL THE PROPERTY OF THE CANAL OF EVERY CHARACTER TO CERTAIN TRUSTEES AND THIS DEED OF TRUST WAS LIKEEWISE FORECLOSED AND CONVEYANCE MADE IN 1889 TO CERTAIN PURCHASERS WHO ASSUMED THE CORPORATE NAME OF THE NOR FOLK  NORTH CAROLINA CANAL CO THIS THIRD CORPORATION ALSO EXE CUTED A DEED OF TRUST WHICLH WAS FORECLOSED IN THE YEAR 1892 AND CONVEYANCE OF THE PROPERTY MADE TO PURCHASERS WHO ASSUMED THE CORPORATE NAME OF THE LAKE DRUMMOND CANAL X WATER COMPANY THE PRESENT STYLE UNDER WHICH THE CANAL IS OPERATED THE LAKE DRUIMMOIID CANAL  WATER COMPANV NOW OWNS THE SAID CANAL AND ALL OF ITS PROPERTY AND APPURTENANCES AND THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMISSION IS WHETHER THE SAID CANAL AND OTHER PROPERTY IS FREE FROMN TAXATION IN THE HANDS OF THIS PRESENT OWNER THE LAKE DRUM MOND CANAL  WATER COMPANY THE THREE CORPORATIONS SUBSE QUENT TO THE ORIGINAL DISNMAL SWAMNP CANAL COMPANY BECAME COR PORATIOLNS EACH IN TURN RESPECTIVELY UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF A STATUTE CARRIED INTO THE CODE OF 1887 AS SECTIONS 1233 AND 1234 THIS STATUTE PROVIDES THAT UPON FORECLOSURE OF A DEED OF TRUST OR MORTGAGE COVERING ALL THE WORKS AND PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY THE

MAY NOT BE EXPRESSLY ASSUMED IN THE CONTRACT OF PURCHASE AND THE WHOLE PROFITS OF THE BUSINESS DONE BY SUCH CORPORATION SHALL BELONG1904 COMMONWEALTH V LAKE DRUMMOND CANAL CO 239 TO THE SAID PURCHASER AND HIS ASSIGNS IN SECTION 1233 IT IS ALSO PROVIDED THAT UPON CONVEYANCE TO THE PURCHASER THE FORMER COM PANY SHALL IPSO FACTO BE DISSOLVED WE DO NOT THINK THAT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF OUR STATUTES AN EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION PASSES TO THE NEW CORPORATION THESE STAT UTORY PROVISIONS WERE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IN N  IV PI PI CO V PENDLETON 156 TU S 667 AND CHESA PEA1ZE  OHIO R R CO V MILLER 114 U S 176 WE RATHER THINK THAT THE RESULT OF THE DECISIONS IN THESE TWO CASES IS THAT THE LAN GUAGE ABOVE QUOTED FROM OUR STATUTE DOES NOT CARRY OVER TO THE PUR CHASING CORPORATION AN EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION CONTAINED IN THE CHARTER OF A CORPORATION THE PROPERTY OF WHICH IS SOLD THERE IS SONE CONFUSION IN THE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AS TO WHETHER IN A STATUTE OF THE CHARACTER UNDER CONSIDERA TION HERE THE WORDS RIGHTS PRIVILEGES AND FRANCHISES INCLUDE EX EMPTION FROM TAXATION PERHAPS THE LANGUAGE OF JUSTICE FIELD IN PICARD V RAILROAD COMVPAIZY 130 U S 637 IS A FAIR EXPRESSION OF THE DOCTRINE OF THAT COURT ON THIS POINT HE SAID  YIELDING TO THE DOCTRINE THAT IMMUNITY FROM TAXATION MAY BE GRANTED THAT POINT BEING ALREADY ADJUDGED IT MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A PERSONAL PRIVILEGE NOT EXTENDING BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE GRANTEE UNLESS OTHERWISE SO DECLARED IN EXPRESS TERMS THE SAME CONSIDERATIONS WHIEH CALL FOR CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE TO JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSION THAT IMMUNITY FROM TAXATION HAS BEEN GRANTED IN ANY INSTANCE MUST REQUIRE SIMILAR DISTINCTNESS OF EXPRESSION BEFORE THE IMMUNITY WILL BE EXTENDED TO OTHERS THAN THE ORIGINAL GRANTEE IT WILL NOT PASS MERELY BY A CONVEYANCE OF PROPERTY AND FRANCHISES OF A RAILWAY COMPANY ALTHOUGH SUCH COMPANY MAY HOLD ITS PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM TAXATION AS WE SAID IN MORGAN V LOUISICTNA 93 U S 217 223 THE FRANCHISE OF A RAILROAD CORPORATION ARE RIGHTS OR PRIVILEGES WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE OPERATIONS OF THE CORPORATION AND WITH OUT WHICH ITS ROAD AND WORKS WOULD BE OF LITTLE VALUE SUCH AS THE FRANCHISE TO TO RUN CARS TO TAKE TOLLS TO APPROPRIATE EARTH AND GRAVEL FOR THE BED OF ITS ROAD OR WATER FOR ITS ENGINES AND THE LIKE THEY ARE POSITIHE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES WITHOUT THE POSSESSION OF WHICH THE ROAD OF THE COMPANY COULD NOT BE SUCCESS FULLY WORKED IMMUNITY FROM TAXATION IS NOT ONE OF THEM THE FORMER MAY BE CONVEYED TO A PURCHASER OF THE ROAD AS PART OF THE PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY THE LATTER IS PERSONAL AND INCAPABLE OF TRANSFER WITHOUT EXPRESS STATUTORY DIREC TION  IT IS TRUE THERE ARE SOME CASES WHERE THE TERM PRIVILEGES HAS BEEN HELD TO INCLUDE IMRNUNITY FROM TAXATION BUT THAT HAS GENERALLY BEEN WHERE OTHER PRO VISIONS OF THE ACT HAVE GIVEN SUCH MEANING TO IT THE LATTER AND WE THINK THE BETTER OPINION IS THAT UNLESS OTHER PROVISIONS REMOVE ALL DOUBT OF THE INTENTION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO INCLUDE THE IMMUNITY IN THE TERM PRIVILEGES I IT WILL NOT BE SO CONSTRUED IT CAN HAVE ITS FULL FORCE BY CONFINING IT TO OTHER GRANTS TO THE CORPORATION240 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JULY MANY CASES WERE CITED BY COUNSEL IN A VERY ABLE ARGUMENT MADE BEFORE THE COMMISSION MOST OF THESE EASES WILL BE FOUND IN NOYES ON INTEREORPORATE RELATIONS SECTION 160 AND THE NOTE TO THAT SEE TION AFTER A CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THIS BRANCH OF THE CASE WE CONCLULDE THAT THE EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION CONFERRED UPON THE ORIGR INAL DISMAL SWAMP CANAL COMPANY WAS NOT TRANSFERRED TO THE THREE CORPORATIONS SUCCEEDING RESPECTIVELY TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY IT WAS EARNESTLY AND VERY FORCIBLY CONTENDED BY COUNSEL FOR THE LAKE DRUMMOND CANAL  WATER COMPANY THAT THE EXEMPTION CON FERRED UPON THE DISMAL SWAMP CANAL COMPANY ORIGINALLY WAS NOT AN EXEMPTION IN THE NATURE OF A PERSONAL PRIVILEGE TO THE CORPORA TION BUT WAS AN EXEMPTION ANNEXED TO THE PROPERTY ITSELF ANI RATHER IN THE NATURE OF A COVENANT RUNNING WITH THE LAND ANL THEREFORE PASSING NECESSARILY TO THE SUCCEEDING OWNERS OF THE PROP ERTY THE ELNTIRE CHARTER IS COUCHED IN THE RATHER QUAINT LANGUAGE OF THE DAY BUT IN FACT THE CORPORATION CREATED HAS CONFERRED UPON IT POWER DIFFERING BUT LITTLE FROM THE POWERS CONFERRED UPON THE EARLIER INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT COMPANIES THE COMMISSION DOES NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO DECLARE A COMPANY OF THIS CHARACTER EXEMPT FRONM TAXATION UNLESS IT IS CONSTRAINED TO DO SO BY LANGUAGE PERFECTLY CLEAR AND PLAIN IT MAY BE THAT THE LANGUAGE USED IN THIS CHARTER IS SUS CEPTIBLE OF THE INTERPRETATION CONTENDED FOR BY THE DEFENDANT COMI1 PANYTHAT IS THAT IT CREATES AN EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION NECES SARILY INHERENT IN AND RUNNING WITH THE LAND INDEPENDENT OF THE OWNERS FROM TIME TO TIME WE DO NOT HOWEVER THINK IF THE INTEN TIOIN OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO CREATE SUCH AN UNUSUAL EXEMPTION IT LHAS BEEN SO DEFINITELY DECLARED AS TO AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSION TO HOLD THAT THE PROPERTY OF THE LAKE DRUMMOND CANAL  WATER COM PANY IS NOW EXEMPT FROM TAXATION IT WAS FURTHER CONTENDED THAT UNDER SECTION 30 OF THE CHARTER A CONTRACT WAS CREATED BETWEEN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA AND THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA EMBODYING ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THE CHARTER OF THE DISMAL SWANMP CANAL COMPANY AND THEREFORE THE STATE OF VIRGINIA COULD NOT TAX THE PROPERTY IN QUESTION WITHOUT THE CON SENT OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA IT SEEMS TO THE COMMISSION THAT THE COMPACT ALLUDED TO IN SECTION 30 OF TLLE CHARTER HAS REFER ENCE TO THE EIGHT 8 ITENMS SET OUT IN TERMS IN SECTION 28 AS CONSTI TUTING THE COMPACT BETWCCN THE TWO STATES AND THAT THE COMPACT1904 COMMONWEALTH V LAKE DRUMMOND CANAL CO 241 REFERRED TO IN SECTION 30 DOES NOT EMBRACE ALL PROVISIONS OF THE CHARTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE COMMISSION IS THAT WE ARE CONSTRAINED TO IMPOSE A FINE UPON THE DEFENDANT LAKE DRUMMOND CANAL  WATER COMPANY FOR FAILURE TO MAKE THE REPORT UNDER SECTION 27 OF THE REVENUE LAW UPON WHICH THIS PROCEEDING IS BASED IT IS ORDERED AS FOLLOWS IT APPEARING TO THE COMMISSION THAT THE DEFENDANT THE LAKE DRUMMOND CANAL  WATER COMPANY IS A CANAL CORPORATION OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA NOT EXEMPT FROM TAXA TION BY VIRTUE OF ITS CHARTER AND THAT IT FAILED AFTER HAVING BLANK FORMS FURNISHED TO IT TO MAKE A REPORT TO THE COMMISSION BEFORE THE FIRST DALY OF SEPTEMBER 1903 OF ALL OF ITS REAL AND PERSONAL PROPELTY OF EVERY DESCRIPTION AS OF THE THIRTIETH DAY OF JUNE 1903 IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES SET OUT IN SECTION 27 OF AN ACT ENTITLED AN ACT TO RAISE REVENUE TO PAY THE INTEREST ON THE PUBLIC DEBT AND TO PROVIDE A SPECIAL TAX FOR PENSIONS AS AUTHORIZED BY SEC TION 189 OF THE CONSTITUTION APPROVED APRIL 16 1903 THE COM MISSION BEING OF OPINION FOR REASONS SET OUT IN WRITING AND

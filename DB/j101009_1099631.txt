j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1099631,Hudson v Barham Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond January 15 1903,i245904,HUDSON V BARHAM Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond January 15 1903 1 TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES Impediments to a fair sale Duty of trustee Rights of parties interested A trustee in a deed of trust to secure debts is the agent of both parties and it is his duty to bring the property to sale under the best possible conditions If there is any cloud on the title or there is doubt or uncertainty as to the debts secured or the amount thereof or disputes or con flicts among creditors or any other impediment to a fair sale he should file a bill to have the matter determined and he may and should delay the sale R Reported by M P Burks State Reporter1903 HUDSON V BARHAM 737 until the matter has been adjusted If he fails or refuses to discharge his duty in this respect any party interested or who would be injured by his default may apply to a court of equity to have the necessary steps taken 2 TRUSTS AND TRUSTEESLiens on trust subject It is not the duty of a trustee to invoke the aid of a court of equity before making a sale merely because there are liens on the trust subject but only where such aid is necessary in order to remove some impediment to the fair execution of the trust 3 CHANCERY PRACTICEConfticting liens on trust propertyRetaining case On a bill filed to enjoin a trustee from selling the trust subject as a whole where it appears that the property conveyed has been subsequently divided into lots and portions of it sold to different purchasers who have erected buildings therepn and that there are liens of mechanics and others on the different lots and other impediments to a fair sale the court should settle the questions raised by the bill and retain the cause and have the trust executed under its supervision 4 INJUNCTIoNSDissolutionAnswer under oathEffect On a motion to dissolve an injunction statements of fact contained in an answer that is sworn to should be taken as true in the absence of evidence to the contrary 5 MECarANics LIENS Prior deeds of trust  Etent of lien  1ow ascertained Where a mechanics lien is recorded against property on which there is a prior deed of trust the trust creditor has priority only to the extent of the value of the land exclusive of the buildings or structures placed thereon by the mechanic since the lien of the deed of trust was created and the value of the land is to be ascertained at the time the liens are enforced by the court The value of the land is to be fixed by the court before sale and the court may fix such value either from evidence submitted to it directly or through the finding of a commissioner subject to review by the court The value so fixed is ali that the trust creditor can get from the proceeds of sale until the mechanics liens thereon have been satisfied 6 CHANCERY PRACTICEAccount of liensCase in judgmentSubsequent liens on property conveyed in trustSale in parcels In this case the trust subject having been divided into lots and lots having been sold to various persons who have erected buildings thereon against which mechanics bave docketed liens and there being judgments constituting liens on some of the lots an account should be taken showing what parts of the trust subject have been sold and to whom with a view to selling the property in the inverse order of alienation and the rights and priorities of the lien creditors should be ascertained and settled before a sale is ordered 7 APPEAL AND ERRoRRefusal to grant injunction No appeal lies to this court from an order of a circuit court refusing an injunction the remedy in such case being by application to this court to grant the injunction refused Appeal from two decrees of the Circuit Court of Elizabeth City county pronounced October 5 1901 and October 24 1901 in a suit in chancery wherein the appellant was the complainant and738 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb the appellees T J Barham trustee and W E Barrett were the defendants Reversed The opinion states the case Raymond M Hudson for the appellant John W Friend for the appellee HARRISON J delivered the opinion of the court This is an injuction bill alleging that on March 8 1900 John H Phillips and A L Weaver conveyed to J T Barham trustee 1086 acres of land in trust to secure W E Barrett the payment of a cer tain note for 2200 that the grantors had afterwards divided the land and had it laid off into 154 town lots with streets and alleys and that this plat entitled Map of Freemans Addition to the City of Newport News had been duly acknowledged and recorded in the clerks office of the county in which the land lay that a num ber of these lots had been sold and conveyed to the complainant and other persons that mechanics liens had been acquired upon build ings erected upon some of the lots and that judgments had also been obtained which rested as liens on the property It is further alleged that Barham trustee had advertised the land for sale as a whole and that if sold as advertised it would not bring enough to pay off the liens but that if sold in lots it would pay off the liens and leave the parcels that had been aliened undis turbed The prayer of the bill is that the trustee and the benefi ciary under the trust deed be made parties defendant and enjoined from selling the property until the further order of the court that the lots not sold be first subjected before selling the lots of com plainant that all necessary accounts be taken and concluding with the usual prayer for general relief The injunction was granted whereupon the trustee and the beneficiary under the deed of trust each filed an answer in which they admit all the allegations of the bill except that they neither admit nor deny that the property if sold in lots will satisfy the liens and leave undisturbed the lots that had been aliened W E Barrett the beneficiary under the deed of trust further answering says that the mechanics and judg ment liens referred to in the bill were acquired after the deed of trust had been executed and recorded and were therefore not valid encumbrances as against the deed of trust J T Barham the1903 IHlUDSON V BARHAM 739 trustee further answering says that before the property was ad vertised he did not know that any one other than the grantors in the deed of trust and the beneficiary thereunder had any interest in the subject that he intended to sell the property according to law and the terms of the deed of trust and that if any one had requested him before the sale to sell the property in lots he would have given such request due and impartial consideration and would not intentionally have permitted any party to be prejudiced by his act but that no such request was made of him On October 5 1901 the defendants moved the circmat court in vacation to dissolve the injunction At the same time the plaintiff asked leave to file an amended bill which set forth more in detail the several parties to whom lots had been sold and the several liens resting upon the property Upon the motion to dissolve the court declined to permit the amended bill as such to be filed but allowed it to be used as an affidavit in support of the original bill An affidavit by John H Phillips one of the grantors in the deed of trust was also filed showing that the Virginia Lumber  Manu facturing Company had mechanics liens on three houses built on the property advertised for sale Affiant further says that unless an account of the liens and their order of priority is taken and the property sold by the lot or in parcels the proceeds will be insuffi cient to pay all the liens without selling the lots purchased by the plaintiff and others Thereupon a vacation order was entered bringing the cause on to be heard upon the original bill the answers of the defendants and the affidavits filed upon consideration where of the injunction theretofore granted was so amended as to only enjoin the trustee from selling the property as a whole and in all other respects it was dissolved From this decree the present appeal has been allowed A trustee in a deed of trust is the agent of both parties and bound to act impartially between them nor ought he to permit the urgency of the creditor to force the sale under circum stances injurious to the debtor at an inadequate price He is bound to bring the estate to hammer under every possible advantage to his cestuis que trustent and he should use all reasonable dili gence to obtain the best price He may and ought of his own motion to apply to a court of equity to remove impediments to a fair execution of his trust to remove any cloud hanging over the title and to adjust accounts if necessary in order to ascertain the740 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb actual debt which ought to be raised by the sale or the amount of prior incumbrances And he will be justified in delaying for these preliminary purposes the sale of the property until such resort may be had to a court of equity If he should fail to do this the party injured by his default has an unquestionable right to do it whether such party be the creditor secured by the deed of trust or a subsequent incumbrancer or the debtor himself or his assigns Rosset v Fisher 11 Gratt 492 If a trustee in patis with power to make sale of real estate for the payment of debts attempts to make such sale while there is a cloud resting on the title to the property or there is any doubt or uncertainty as to the debts secured or the amounts thereof or a dis pute or conflict among the creditors as to their respective claims a court of equity on a bill filed by the debtor secured creditor subsequent incumbrancer or other person having an interest will restrain the trustee until these impediments to a fair sale have by its aid been removed as far as it is practicable to do so Shultz v Iansbrough 33 Gratt 567 Shickel v Improvement Co 99 Va 88 But it is not the duty of a trustee in every case to invoke the aid of a court of equity before making a sale of the trust subject where there are liens thereon and to hold that it is or that if he fails to do so an injunction will be awarded at the instance of any party in interest as of course would be to impose serious delays involving costs and expenses in the execution of deeds of trusts which the law never contemplated and without promoting the interests of either creditor or debtor It is only when the aid of a court of equity is necessary that it ought to be applied for and it is only in such a case that its aid will be extended If there are no real im pediments in the way of a fair execution of the trust then its aid is not necessary and the costs of a lawsuit ought not to be added to the ordinary cost of executing the trust Mullers Admr v Stone 84 Va 834 In the light of these wellsettled principles w3 are of opinion that the lower court in the exercise of a sound discretion should have retained the cause and had the trust executed under its super intendence and direction Anderson v Phlegar 93 Va 415 The answers admit the alleged alienations of portions of the property and admit the existence of the liens as alleged It is denied that the liens mentioned are prior in dignity to the deed of1903 HUDSON V BARHAM 741 trust and so far as the judgment liens are concerned this on a motion to dissolve must be taken as true the answers being sworn to and no proof adduced on the subject The appellees insist that the deed of trust constitutes the first lien upon the several houses and lots upon which mechanics liens are admitted to have been taken out This contention is not sound The prior incum brancer has the benefit of his lien upon the land to the extent of its value exclusive of the buildings or structures placed thereon since the lien was created and the value of the land is to be ascertained at the time the liens are enforced by the court Nor can there be any doubt as to the manner whereby it is to be ascertained It is to be fixed by the ccurt either from evidence submitted directly to it or through the finding of a commissioner subject to review by the court as in other chancery causes But the value is to be estimated and fixed by the court before the property is sold and the prior in cumbrancer as to the sum so fixed is to be preferred in the distribu tion of the proceeds of sale The amount however is all that can ob tain from the proceeds of sale until the mechanics having liens thereon are satisfied Trust Co v Dennis 93 Va 504 The decree appealed from restrains the trustee from selling the property as a whole It leaves him however with unlimited power to sell the whole property in parcels It is impossible that the houses and lots upon which the mechanics liens rest can be brought to sale without sacrifice until the value of such lots without the buildings is ascertained in order that the prior incumbrancer and the mechanic can know the extent of their respective interests in the subject Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the conditions dis closed by the record make it proper that the appellant should be allowed to file an amended bill bringing in all necessary additional parties to the end that the whole matter may be administered under the orders and decrees of the court That before a sale is ordered an account be taken showing what parts of the trust subject have been sold and to whom aliened with a view to selling the property in the inverse order of its alienation and that the rights and priorities of the several lien creditors be ascertained and established Shortly after the decree of October 5th was entered dissolving the injunction the appellant presented another bill praying for an injunction against the sale until an account was taken This motion was overruled by a vacation order of October 26 1901742 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb which is also complained of in the petition for appeal We have no power however to review that action as no appeal lies to this court from an order refusing an injunction the remedy in such case being by application to this court to grant the injunction refused For the foregoing reasons the decree appealed from of October 5 1901 must be reversed and the cause remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings to be had in accordance with the views ex pressed in this opinion Reversed NOTEThe various rulings in this case as to the proper practice where title to trust property is clouded and there are conflicting liens or liens for unascer tained amounts are sustained by numerous prior decisions and need no com ment It may be well to point out that the priority which the court accorded to the mechanics liens over the prior deed of trust to the extent of the value of the buildings rests not on the unwritten law as might be inferred from the opinion but on the express provisions of section 2483 of the Code The ruling that no appeal lies from an order refusing an injunctionthe proper method being to make an application to the appellate court in the nature of an original proceedingis we believe in accordance with the generally un derstood practice So far as we recall this is the first distinct ruling however on the point by the Supreme Court of Appeals

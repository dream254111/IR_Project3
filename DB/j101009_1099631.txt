DEBTS ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SUCH SALE WHILE THERE IS A CLOUD RESTING ON THE TITLE TO THE PROPERTY OR THERE IS ANY DOUBT OR UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE DEBTS SECURED OR THE AMOUNTS THEREOF OR A DIS PUTE OR CONFLICT AMONG THE CREDITORS AS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CLAIMS A COURT OF EQUITY ON A BILL FILED BY THE DEBTOR SECURED CREDITOR SUBSEQUENT INCUMBRANCER OR OTHER PERSON HAVING AN INTEREST WILL RESTRAIN THE

THAT ITS AID WILL BE EXTENDED IF THERE ARE NO REAL IM PEDIMENTS IN THE WAY OF A FAIR EXECUTION OF THE TRUST THEN ITS AID IS NOT NECESSARY AND THE COSTS OF A LAWSUIT OUGHT NOT TO BE ADDED TO THE ORDINARY COST OF EXECUTING THE TRUST MULLERS ADMR V STONE 84 VA 834 IN THE LIGHT OF THESE WELLSETTLED PRINCIPLES W3 ARE OF OPINION THAT THE LOWER COURT IN THE EXERCISE OF A SOUND DISCRETION SHOULD HAVE RETAINED THE CAUSE AND HAD THE TRUST EXECUTED UNDER ITS SUPER INTENDENCE AND DIRECTION ANDERSON V PHLEGAR 93 VA 415 THE ANSWERS ADMIT THE ALLEGED ALIENATIONS OF PORTIONS OF THE PROPERTY AND ADMIT THE EXISTENCE OF THE LIENS AS ALLEGED IT IS DENIED THAT THE LIENS MENTIONED ARE PRIOR IN DIGNITY TO THE DEED OF1903 HUDSON V BARHAM 741 TRUST AND SO FAR AS THE JUDGMENT LIENS ARE CONCERNED THIS ON A MOTION TO DISSOLVE MUST BE TAKEN AS TRUE THE ANSWERS BEING SWORN TO AND NO PROOF ADDUCED ON THE SUBJECT THE APPELLEES INSIST THAT THE DEED OF TRUST CONSTITUTES THE FIRST LIEN UPON THE SEVERAL HOUSES AND LOTS UPON WHICH MECHANICS LIENS ARE ADMITTED TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT THIS CONTENTION IS NOT SOUND THE PRIOR INCUM BRANCER HAS THE BENEFIT OF HIS LIEN UPON THE LAND TO THE EXTENT OF ITS VALUE EXCLUSIVE OF THE BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES PLACED THEREON SINCE THE LIEN WAS CREATED AND THE VALUE OF THE LAND IS TO BE ASCERTAINED AT THE TIME THE LIENS ARE ENFORCED BY THE COURT NOR CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE MANNER WHEREBY IT IS TO BE ASCERTAINED IT IS TO BE FIXED BY THE CCURT EITHER FROM EVIDENCE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO IT OR THROUGH THE FINDING OF A COMMISSIONER SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE COURT AS IN OTHER CHANCERY CAUSES BUT THE VALUE IS TO BE ESTIMATED AND FIXED BY THE COURT BEFORE THE PROPERTY IS SOLD AND THE PRIOR IN CUMBRANCER AS TO THE SUM SO FIXED IS TO BE PREFERRED IN THE DISTRIBU TION OF THE PROCEEDS OF SALE THE AMOUNT HOWEVER IS ALL THAT CAN OB TAIN FROM THE PROCEEDS OF SALE UNTIL THE MECHANICS HAVING LIENS THEREON ARE SATISFIED TRUST CO V DENNIS 93 VA 504 THE DECREE APPEALED FROM RESTRAINS THE TRUSTEE FROM SELLING THE PROPERTY AS A WHOLE IT LEAVES HIM HOWEVER WITH UNLIMITED POWER TO SELL THE WHOLE PROPERTY IN PARCELS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE HOUSES AND LOTS UPON WHICH THE MECHANICS LIENS REST CAN BE BROUGHT TO SALE WITHOUT SACRIFICE UNTIL THE VALUE OF SUCH LOTS WITHOUT THE BUILDINGS IS ASCERTAINED IN ORDER THAT THE PRIOR INCUMBRANCER AND THE MECHANIC CAN KNOW THE EXTENT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE INTERESTS IN THE SUBJECT UPON THE WHOLE CASE WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE CONDITIONS DIS CLOSED BY THE RECORD MAKE IT PROPER THAT THE APPELLANT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO FILE AN AMENDED BILL BRINGING IN ALL NECESSARY ADDITIONAL PARTIES TO THE END THAT THE WHOLE MATTER MAY BE ADMINISTERED UNDER THE ORDERS AND DECREES OF THE COURT THAT BEFORE A SALE IS ORDERED AN ACCOUNT BE TAKEN SHOWING WHAT PARTS OF THE TRUST SUBJECT HAVE BEEN SOLD AND TO WHOM ALIENED WITH A VIEW TO SELLING THE PROPERTY IN THE INVERSE ORDER OF ITS ALIENATION AND THAT THE RIGHTS AND PRIORITIES OF THE SEVERAL LIEN CREDITORS BE ASCERTAINED AND ESTABLISHED SHORTLY AFTER THE DECREE OF OCTOBER 5TH WAS ENTERED DISSOLVING THE INJUNCTION THE APPELLANT PRESENTED ANOTHER BILL PRAYING FOR AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE SALE UNTIL AN ACCOUNT WAS TAKEN THIS MOTION WAS OVERRULED BY A VACATION ORDER OF OCTOBER 26 1901742 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB WHICH IS ALSO COMPLAINED OF IN THE PETITION FOR APPEAL WE HAVE NO POWER HOWEVER TO REVIEW THAT ACTION AS NO APPEAL LIES TO THIS COURT FROM AN ORDER REFUSING AN INJUNCTION THE REMEDY IN SUCH CASE BEING BY APPLICATION TO THIS COURT TO GRANT THE INJUNCTION REFUSED FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS THE DECREE APPEALED FROM OF OCTOBER 5 1901 MUST BE REVERSED AND THE CAUSE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS TO BE HAD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VIEWS EX PRESSED IN THIS OPINION REVERSED NOTETHE VARIOUS RULINGS IN THIS CASE AS TO THE PROPER PRACTICE WHERE TITLE TO TRUST PROPERTY IS CLOUDED AND THERE ARE CONFLICTING LIENS OR LIENS FOR UNASCER TAINED AMOUNTS ARE SUSTAINED BY NUMEROUS PRIOR DECISIONS AND NEED NO COM MENT IT MAY BE WELL TO POINT OUT THAT THE PRIORITY WHICH THE COURT ACCORDED TO THE MECHANICS LIENS OVER THE PRIOR DEED OF TRUST TO THE EXTENT OF THE VALUE OF THE BUILDINGS RESTS NOT ON THE UNWRITTEN LAW AS MIGHT BE INFERRED FROM THE OPINION BUT ON THE EXPRESS PROVISIONS OF SECTION 2483 OF THE CODE THE RULING THAT NO APPEAL LIES FROM AN ORDER REFUSING AN INJUNCTIONTHE PROPER METHOD BEING TO MAKE AN APPLICATION TO THE APPELLATE COURT IN THE NATURE OF AN ORIGINAL PROCEEDINGIS WE BELIEVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERALLY UN DERSTOOD PRACTICE SO FAR AS WE RECALL THIS IS THE FIRST DISTINCT RULING HOWEVER ON THE POINT BY THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS

THE PROMOTION OF COMMERCE1 PRIOR TO THE UNIFICATION OT THE EMPIRE IN 1871 GERMANY REPRE SENTED AN AGRICULTURAL NATION WITH FEW MANUFACTURES WITH SCARCELY ANY MERCHANT MARINE AND WITH COMPARATIVELY LITTLE FOREIGN TRADE NEARLY TWOTHIRDS OF THE POPULATION WAS RURAL HER INDUSTRIAL CAPITAL WAS SMALL AND BUSINESS IN GENERAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH EXTREME CARE AND CAUTION WITHIN THE SHORT SPACE OF A FEW DECADES HOWEVER THE SITUATION HAS BEEN STRIKINGLY REVERSED AND HER INTERESTS INSTEAD OF BEING MAINLY AGRICULTURAL HAVE BECOME OVERWHELMINGLY THOSE OF A MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIAL NATION HER POPULATION ALREADY EQUAL TO OVER 650 FOR EVERY THOUSAND ACRES OF FOODPRODUCING LAND STILL SHOWS THE SURPRISING INCREASE OF EIGHT PER CENT DURING THE HALF DECADE FROM 1895 TO I900 NO LESS THAN FIFTYSEVEN PER CENT OF HER FIFTYSIX MILLION PEOPLE IN 900O WERE ENGAGED IN INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS WHILE DURING THE GENERATION FROM 1871 TO I9OO HER URBAN POPULATION IN CREASED FIFTEEN AND THREEFOURTHS MILLIONS AS OPPOSED TO AN INCREASE OF ONLY FIFTEEN AND ONETHIRD MILLIONS FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IN OTHER WORDS GERMANY HAS REACHED AN ECONOMIC POSITION WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THAT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF A COUNTRY NO LONGER SELFCONTAINED BUT WHOSE INDUSTRIES DEPEND TO AN INCREASING DEGREE UPON RAW MATERIALS FROM ABROAD AND ONETHIRD OF WHOSE POPU LATION IS FED WITH FOREIGN FOOD TO PROTECT HERSELF AGAINST THE VICIS SITUDES OF THE FUTURE GERMANY MUST NECESSARILY BECOME MORE AND MORE AN EXPORTING AND MARITIME NATION SUCH BEING THE PROBLEM WHICH DEMANDS SOLUTION IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS STATE AND IMPERIAL HAVE UTILIZED EVERY MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO STIMULATE TRADE AND NAVI GATION INDEED GOVERNMENT AID IN GERMANY HAS BEEN EXTENDED SO AS TO EMBRACE EVERY PHASE OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IN THE FIRST LAMONG THE CHIEF AUTHORITIES RELIED UPON IN THIS SKETCH ARE THE BRITISH DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR REPORTS THE AMERICAN CONSULAR REPORTS THE REPORTS OF THE COMMISSIONER OF NAVIGATION FROM 1899 TO 1903 HAMBURGS HANDEL UND SCHIFFAHRT LOTZS VERKEHRSENT WICKELUNG IN DEUTSCHLAND 18001900 H R MEYERS SERIES OF ARTICLES ON

DIE NORDWESTEUROPAISCHEN WELTHAFEN INFORMATION HAS BEEN FREELY DRAWN FROM THIS WORK IT PROVED TO BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS GENERAL AND EXHAUSTIVE TREATMENT OF THE SUBJECT 525THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PLACE GERMAN MANUFACTURERS ENJOY A FOREIGN MARKET WHICH HAS BEEN VASTLY ENLARGED SINCE 1891 THROUGH FAVORABLE TREATY ARRANGEMENTS LARGE SUMS ARE EXPENDED ANNUALLY IN FOSTERING INDUSTRIAL AND COM MERCIAL EDUCATION TO AN EXTENT SELDOM MET WITH IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND WITH RESULTS WHICH HAVE CALLED FORTH WARNING NOTES FROM BRITISH AND AMERICAN CONSULS IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD THE SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY IS FAVORED NOT ONLY WITH PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY RATES AND AN EXEMPTION FROM THE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMS DUTIES ON SHIPBUILDING MATERIAL BUT ALSO WITH A MONOPOLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL WAR VESSELS AND SUBSIDIZED MAIL STEAMERS FURTHERMORE THE IM PERIAL GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARKED UPON A POLICY OF SUBSIDIZING THE MERCHANT MARINE OVER 7000000 MARKS ARE PAID ANNUALLY IN THE FORM OF MAIL SUBSIDIES TO THOSE LINES WHICH ARE ENGAGED IN THE ASIATIC PACIFIC AND AFRICAN SERVICE WHILE THIS SUM IS PAID NOFNINALLY FOR CARRYING THE MAILS THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT AN EQUALLY IMPOR TANT REASON IS THE DESIRE TO STRENGTHEN THE NAVY TO FREE GERMAN COMMERCE FROM THE AGENCY OF FOREIGN NATIONS AND TO EXTEND GERMAN TRADE AND INFLUENCE TO THOSE PARTS OF THE EARTH WHERE HER POSITION IS WEAKEST AND WHERE PRIVATE INITIATIVE IF LEFT TO ITSELF MIGHT PROVE INADEQUATE ALL THESE METHODS OF ASSISTING COMMERCE HOWEVER CONSTITUTE ONLY A PART AND PERHAPS THE SMALLEST PART OF THE GENERAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AID IN HER SEARCH FOR A SHORT CUT TO COMMERCIAL POWER GERMANY LIKE ALL THE GREAT NATIONS HAS EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF CHEAP AND EASY TRANSPORTATION IN THE WINNING OF DISTANT MARKETS NEITHER MONEY NOR LABOR HAS BEEN SPARED IN AN ENDEAVOR TO FACILITATE TRANSPORTATION TO THE INNERMOST PARTS OF THE EMPIRE AND TO UNITE THE HIGHLY RAMIFIED SYSTEM OF ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL WATERWAYS OF THE INTERIOR WITH THE LARGER COMMERCIAL LIFE OF THE OCEAN IT IS TO A DISCUSSION OF THIS LAST PHASE OF GERMAN COMMERCE THAT THE PRESENT PAPER IS PRINCIPALLY DIRECTED IN THIS CONNECTION IT WILL BE ATTEMPTED TO STATE BRIEFLY THE ESSENTIAL FACTS WITH REFERENCE FIRST TO THE CONTROL AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE HARBORS AND SECONDLY TO THE RELATION WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN THESE HARBORS AND THE INTERIOR THROUGH THE NETWORK OF RIVERS CANALS AND RAIL WAYS I THE MANAGEMENT OF HARBORS ALTHOUGH THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT OF GERMANY EXERCISES A LARGE MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER THE MERCHANT MARINE AND OVER NAVIGA 526 96PROMOTION OF COMMERCE IN GERMANY TION ON INTERSTATE WATERWAYS IT POSSESSES BROADLY SPEAKING NO AUTHORITY TO CONSTRUCT OR MANAGE HARBORS THIS FUNCTION BEING INTRUSTED SOLELY TO THE CARE OF THE SEVERAL STATES IN HAMBURG AND BREMEN THE HARBORS ARE OPERATED AS STATE PROPERTY THE WORK OF CONSTRUCTION BEING PLACED IN THE HANDS OF A SPECIAL DEPARTMENT FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THE GENERAL SUPERVISION AND CARE OF THE HARBOR BEING EXERCISED IN HAMBURG BY A DEPART MENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE AND IN BREMEN BY A DEPARTMENT FOR HARBORS AND RAILWAYS OVER BOTH THESE DEPARTMENTS STANDS THE SENATE OF THE STATE WHICH EXERCISES THE ULTIMATE EXECUTIVE POWER ALL EXPENDITURES FOR PURPOSES OF CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION ARE BORNE BY THE TWO CITYREPUBLICS THEMSELVES AND ARE DEFRAYED FROM GENERAL TAXATION THE RECEIPTS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE MERGED WITH THE GENERAL INCOME OF THE STATE THERE BEING NO NECESSARY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE EXPENDITURES FOR HARBORS AND THE RECEIPTS DERIVED THEREFROM IN THE CASE OF BOTH THESE WORLDPORTS THE STATE EITHER OWNS OR CONTROLS THE LARGER PORTION OF THE WAREHOUSE SYSTENI BREMEN FOR EXAMPLE IN RETURN FOR A STIPULATED PERCENTAGE OF THE NET EARNINGS FURNISHES THE GROUND AND CONSTRUCTS THE BUILDINGS BUT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE MANAGEMENT OR BUSINESS ACTIVITY OF THE SYSTEM EXCEPT AS REGARDS THE REGULATION OF THE WAREHOUSE DUES HAM BURG ON THE OTHER HAND DOES NOT IN THE MAIN ASSUME THE DUTY OF CONSTRUCTING THE BUILDINGS BUT MEREL 7 LEASES THE GROUND FOR A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE NET EARNINGS TO A FREE HARBOR WAREHOUSE ASSO CIATION THIS ASSOCIATION WHILE OBLIGED TO CONSTRUCT ALL NECES SARY BUILDINGS AND BEAR ALL FINANCIAL LOSSES IS NEVERTHELESS SUBJECT TO A LARGE MEASURE OF STATE CONTROL TO THE SENATE BELONGS THE RIGHT OF REGULATING THE WAREHOUSE DUES AND OF DETERMINING THE NATURE OF THE BUILDINGS TO BE CONSTRUCTED LIKEWISE ALL ACTS WHICH INVOLVE AN INCREASE IN THE CAPITAL STOCK OR INDEBTEDNESS OF THE ASSO CIATION OR A CHANGE IN ITS RULES MUST BE SANCTIONED BY THE SENATE FINALLY THE STATE IS REPRESENTED IN THE DIRECTORATE OF THE ASSOCIATION AND POSSESSES THE POWER TO SUSPEND ANY ACT OF THAT BODY UNTIL THE SENATE MAY HAVE PASSED ON ITS EXPEDIENCY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID CONCERNING HAMBURG AND BREMEN HOLDS IN A GENERAL WAY FOR THE OTHER GERMAN HARBORS AS A RULE THEIR CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT IS INTRUSTED TO THE CARE OF LOCAL BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS SUBJECT TO THE GENERAL SUPERVISION OF THE STATE 527 97THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN LUEBECK TO A BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS AND THE POLICE AUTHORITY IN ROSTOCK TO A BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS AND IN WISMAR TO A HARBOR DEPARTMENT IN PRUSSIA THE MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF HARBORS IS CONDUCTED EITHER UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS FOR EACH RESPECTIVE CITY OR BY PERMANENT COMMISSIONS WHICH ARE LOCAL IN CHARACTER BUT WHICH MUST RECEIVE THE SANCTION OF THE STATE AS REGARDS HARBOR IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BE SPECIFIC ALL HARBOR MATTERS IN STETTIN ARE MAN AGED BY A BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS IN KIEL BY A HARBOR COMMIS SION IN FLENSBURG BY A HARBOR AND BRIDGE COMMISSION IN SWINE MUENDE BY A ROYAL COMMISSION OF NAVIGATION OFFICIATING AS A LOCAL AUTHORITY AND IN KOENIGSBERG BY A ROYAL HARBOR POLICE COM MISSION THE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A RULE ARE BORNE BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND ARE DEFRAYED FROM THE HARBOR RECEIPTS II IMPROVEMENT OF HARBOR CHANNELS DURING THE LAST TWENTYFIVE YEARS NEARLY ALL THE LEADING SEA PORTS OF NORTHWEST EUROPE HAVE EXERTED THEMSELVES TO THE UTMOST IN AN ENDEAVOR TO ADAPT THEIR FACILITIES TO THE GROWING CONDITIONS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE INDEED PRACTICALLY ALL THE LEADING PORTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LONDON HAVE REMAINED CLOSE RIVALS IN THIS RESPECT DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS PERIOD THIS STRENUOUS COMPE TITION MAY BE ATTRIBUTED FIRST TO THE RAPIDLY INCREASING SIZE AND DRAUGHT OF OCEAN STEAMERS AND SECONDLY TO THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THESE PORTS FOR THE EASTERN TRADE AND THE CONSEQUENT DESIRE TO ACCOMMODATE SHIPS OF THE SUEZ STANDARD THE LESS ANYONE OF THESE HARBORS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE INFLUENCE OF TIDE THE GREATER IS THE ADVANTAGE OF THAT PORT HENCE ANY EFFORT ON THE PART OF ONE HARBOR TO DEEPEN ITS CHANNEL OR TO IMPROVE ITS FACILITIES FOR LANDING LOADING AND UNLOADING HAS RESULTED IN A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE OTHER PORTS AS REGARDS THE CHANNEL LEADING FROM THE SEA TO THE LANDING PLACE THE GERMANDUTCHBELGIAN PORTS CANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN FAVORED BY NATURE WHATEVER POSITION THESE HARBORS NOW HOLD HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF VAST LABOR AND EXPENDITURE AND THE IMPROVE MENTS HAVE BY NO MEANS BEEN COMPLETED HAMBURG UNTIL ABOUT I850 POSSESSED A CHANNEL MEASURING ONLY FROM 40 TO 43 METERS IN DEPTH AT HIGH TIDE AT AN ENORMOUS EXPENDITURE THIS DEPTH HAS BEEN INCREASED TO 83 METERS WHILE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN 528 98PROMOTION OF COMMERCE IN GERMANY MADE FOR A FURTHER INCREASE OF 17 METERS BREMEN HAS ALSO LABORED UNDER UNUSUAL DIFFICULTIES SINCE ITS ORIGINAL CHANNEL MEASURED ONLY 25 METERS IN DEPTH AFTER AN OUTLAY OF SOME 50000000 MARKS HOWEVER THIS CITY HAS SECURED A CHANNEL WHICH CAN ACCOMMODATE OCEANGOING VESSELS WITH A DRAUGHT OF 6 METERS THE THREE DUTCHBELGIAN PORTS HAVE EACH ABANDONED THEIR ORIGINAL CHANNEL DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND WITH THE HELP OF THE STATE HAVE CONSTRUCTED FOR THEMSELVES AN ENTIRELY NEW OPEN ING TO THE SEA AMSTERDAM HAS RECEIVED FULLY 37000000 MARKS FROM THE STATE DURING THE LAST THIRTY YEARS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE NORTH SEA CANAL AND HAS INCREASED ITS DEPTH TO 9 METERS SO THAT ALL SHIPS EXCEPT THE VERY LARGEST CAN OBTAIN AN EASY ACCESS TO THE PORT ROTTERDAM ASSISTED LIBERALLY BY THE NATIONAL GOVERN MENT HAS SECURED THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW CHANNEL AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY 6I700000 MARKS FOR ANTWERP THE STATE HAS ALSO EXPENDED LARGE SUMS TOWARD DEEPENING AND STRAIGHTENING THE CHANNEL AND ACCORDING TO PLANS NOW BEING ARRANGED IT IS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE PRESENT DEPTH OF 6 METERS AT LOW JTIDE AND I04 METERS AT HIGH TIDE TO 8 AND I24 METERS RESPECTIVELY IN THE CASE OF EVERY ONE OF THESE PORTS LARGE SUMS HAVE THUS BEEN EXPENDED TO SECURE A SUIT ABLE WATERWAY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BREMEN EACH PORT HAS ALSO PLANS ARRANGED FOR OR UNDER PROSECUTION WHICH WHEN COM PLETED WILL ENABLE IT TO RECEIVE VESSELS WITH A DRAUGHT AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE SUEZ STANDARD III IMPROVEMENT OF HARBOR FACILITIES THE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE LEADING PORTS OF EUROPE CONCERNING THE IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR CHANNELS ALSO EXISTS IN THE PROVISION OF BASINS WHARVES WAREHOUSES AND OTHER NECESSARY EQUIPMENT ENOR MOUS SUMS HAVE BEEN PAID BY MOST OF THE PORTS IN RENDERING EASIER AND SWIFTER THE PROCESS OF LOADING AND UNLOADING PARTICULARLY IS THIS TRUE OF HAMBURG NEARLY ALL OF WHOSE HARBOR FACILITIES HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS EVEN AS LATE AS I866 ALL SEAGOING VESSELS WERE OBLIGED TO ANCHOR IN THE OPEN STREAM AND THE WHOLE PROCESS OF LOADING AND UNLOADING HAD TO BE CONDUCTED BY MEANS OF LIGHTERS ABOUT THAT TIME HOWEVER HAMBURG BEGAN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SERIES OF IMPROVEMENTS WITH THE RESULT THAT TODAY HER SYSTEM OF DOCKS AND PIERS IS REPUTED TO BE THE BEST IN EXISTENCE AND HER SHIP LINES ACCORDING TO DR WIEDENFELD ENJOY AN 529 99THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EASE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE SHORE FAR SUPERIOR TO THAT FURNISHED BY THE ENGLISH PORTS BESIDES POSSESSING PROBABLY THE BEST SYSTEM OF WAREHOUSES IN THE WORLD HAMBURG HAS MADE ADMIRABLE CONNECTION WITH THE RAILWAYS AND INTERIOR WATERWAYS SEPARATE HARBOR BASINS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED FOR THE NUMEROUS CANAL AND RIVER BOATS WHERE THEY MAY REMAIN TO AWAIT THE ARRIVAL OF STEAMERS THE STEAMER BASINS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED WITH A VIEW TO MAKING A SWIFT TRANSFER OF FREIGHT TO AND FROM VESSELS THE PRIME CONSIDERATION ANY GAIN IN THIS RESPECT MEANING OF COURSE A CORRESPONDING GAIN IN THE LENGTH OF AVAILABLE PIERS THE WHARVES BESIDES BEING EXCEEDINGLY SPACIOUS AND BUILT OF DURABLE MATERIAL ARE AMPLY SUPPLIED WITH HYDRAULIC MACHINERY AT THE PRESENT TIME THE BASINS COVER AN AREA OF 3364 ACRES WHILE THE TOTAL LENGTH OF QUAYS APPROXIMATES 85 MILES EX TENSIONS ARE NOW BEING MADE HOWEVER WHICH WILL INCREASE THE AREA OF THE BASINS TO 61256 ACRES AND THE LENGTH OF THE QUAYS TO 12 MILES WHEN THIS PROJECT IS COMPLETED HAMBURG WILL HAVE SPENT SOME 18OOOOOOO MARKS SINCE I880 FOR ITS HARBOR FACILITIESOF WHICH SUM THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTED 40000000 MARKS AT THE TIME OF HAMBURGS ACCESSION TO THE CUSTOMS UNIONAND THIS ENORMOUS OUTLAY DOES NOT INCLUDE THE LARGE SUMS EXPENDED IN DEEPENING AND OTHERWISE IMPROVING THE CHANNEL OR IN CONSTRUCTING THE EXCELLENT SYSTEM OF WAREHOUSES IT ONLY REQUIRES THE FURTHER DEEPENING OF THE CHANNEL FOR WHICH ARRANGEMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AND THE COMPLETION OF THE EXTENSIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE TO MAKE HAMBURGS HARBOR SATISFY THE HIGHEST REQUIREMENTS OF MODERN EFFICIENCY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID OF HAMBURG IS TRUE OF BREMEN AND THE DUTCHBELGIAN PORTS THOUGH ON A SMALLER SCALE IN THE PROVISION OF APPLIANCES FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING FREIGHT THESE HARBORS ARE PRACTICALLY ON A PAR AND MEET THE LATEST REQUIREMENTS IN ALL TOO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HARBOR WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE NEW WAREHOUSES WOULD BE SITUATED AT ONCE NEAR THE WATER AND IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE LARGE MERCANTILE OFFICES LIMITING OUR DISCUSSION TO THE SUMS EXPENDED IT APPEARS THAT SUBSEQUENT TO I885 BREMEN HAS PAID IN ROUND NUMBERS 93 800OQO MARKS FOR ITS HARBOR FACILITIES EXCLUSIVE OF THE 50000000 MARKS DEVOTED TO THE DEEPENING OF THE CHANNEL OF THIS SUM THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTED I2OOOOOO MARKS WHEN BREMEN 530 100PROMOTION OF COMMERCE IN GERMANY JOINED THE CUSTOMS UNION IN I888 AND 18OOOOO MARKS TOWARDS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE KAISERDOCK AT BREMERHAFEN EXCLUSIVE OF THE EXPENDITURES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CHANNEL AMSTER DAM HAS SPENT 42500000 MARKS FOR ITS HARBOR FACILITIES ROTTERDAM ABOUT 30000000 MARKS WHILE ANTWERP SINCE I879 HAS PAID APPROXI MATELY I3OOOOOOO FRANCS OF WHICH SUM THE STATE CONTRIBUTED CONSIDERABLE MORE THAN ONEHALF LARGE SUMS HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPENDED IN STETTIN DANZIG KIEL EMDEN AND OTHER SMALLER PORTS ON THE NORTH SEA STETTIN AFTER AN OUTLAY OF SOME 40000000 MARKS HAS SECURED A HARBOR WHICH IS NOT ONLY BEGINNING TO SHARE IN THE AMERICAN TRADE BUT WHICH AT THE EXPENSE OF COPENHAGEN AND GOTHENBURG IS RAPIDLY ACQUIRING MORE AND MORE OF THE RUSSIAN AND SCANDINAVIAN TRADE ALTOGETHER IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THE SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS OF GERMANY HAVE DEVOTED ABOUT I25000000 SINCE 1888 TOWARDS THE IMPROVEMENT OF HARBORS AND THAT OF THIS SUM ABOUT SIXTENTHS HAS BEEN USED FOR THE CHANNEL AND OTHER FACILI TIES OF HAMBURG ALONE THIS SINGLE PORT IT HAS BEEN SAID HAS SPENT MORE MONEY THAN ANY OTHER TWO HARBORS IN THE WORLD TOGETHER DURING THE LAST SCORE OF YEARS TO PERFECT ITS TECHNICAL FACILITIES2 IV COMMERCIAL GROWTH OF HARBORS ALONG WITH THE LARGE EXPENDITURES FOR HARBOR IMPROVEMENTS THERE HAS FOLLOWED AN INCREASED POWER TO HANDLE TRAFFIC AND A TRE MENDOUS GROWTH IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE HARBORS FROM THE STAND POINT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE THIS BECOMES ESPECIALLY CLEAR IF ONE COMPARES THE NET REGISTERED TONNAGE OF VESSELS ENTERING AND LEAVING THE VARIOUS PORTS THUS THE TOTAL NET REGISTERED TONNAGE OF VESSELS ENGAGED IN FOREIGN TRADE HAS BEEN COMPILED AS FOLLOWS FOR THE EIGHT LEADING HARBORS OF NORTHERN EUROPE TOTAL FOREIGN TRADE IN THS YEAR 8 1000 NET REGISTERED TONS 1870 1880 1890 1900 LONDON  7116 10577 13481 16701 LIVERPOOL 6773 9659 10941 11668

ACADEMY BURG IN I9OO I6088000 IS BUT SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THE TONNAGE OF LONDON I670I000 WHILE ANTWERP AND ROTTERDAM EACH HAS A TONNAGE WHICH ABOUT EQUALS THAT OF LIVERPOOL IT APPEARS FURTHERMORE THAT THE TONNAGE OF THE THREE PORTS OF HAMBURG ROTTERDAM AND ANTWERP HAS INCREASED DURING THE LAST THIRTY YEARS BY 443 PER CENT AS OPPOSED TO AN INCREASE OF ONLY I35 PER CENT FOR LONDON ONLY 72 PER CENT FOR LIVERPOOL AND GO PER CENT FOR HAVRE INDEED DURING THE SINGLE DECADE FROM I890 TO 900O THE TOTAL NET REGISTERED TONNAGE FOR THE FIRST THREE CITIES INCREASED OVER 63 PER CENT WHEREAS FOR LONDON LIVERPOOL AND HAVRE THE INCREASE BUT SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED 13 PER CENT FOR THE YEAR I902 THE TOTAL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF HAMBURG WERE APPROXIMATELY I707664000 AND FOR ANTWERP 660O60OOO AS OPPOSED TO 528741000 FOR BREMEN I260290000 FOR LONDON AND I138700OO000 FOR LIVERPOOL IT IS INTERESTING ALSO TO NOTE THAT THE COMBINED TRADE IN TONS OF THE FOUR PORTS OF KOENIGSBERG DANZIG LUEBECK AND STETTIN HAS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 50 PER CENT DURING THE DECADE FROM I890 TO I900 OR AT A RATE NOT VERY MUCH BELOW THAT OF HAMBURG AND BREMEN V CONSTRUCTION OF CANALS AND CANALIZATION OF RIVERS THE EXTRAORDINARY GROWTH WHICH WE HAVE JUST NOTED IN THE SEA NAVIGATION OF HAMBURG BREMEN AND THE DUTCHBELGIAN PORTS CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY THEIR GOOD CONNECTION WITH THE GERMAN INTERIOR IT IS THE RELATION TO A LARGE AND PRODUCTIVE INTERIOR MORE THAN ANY OTHER FACTOR WHICH DETERMINES THE INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF HARBORS AND HAMBURG BE IT SAID IN THIS CONNECTION IS MORE FAVORABLY SITUATED THAN ANY OTHER CITY OF THE OLD WORLD ITS INFLUENCE EXTENDS NOT ONLY OVER MOST OF GERMANY AND AUSTRO HUNGARY BUT AS REGARDS CERTAIN COMMODITIES EVEN INTO RUSSIA AND SWITZERLAND BESIDES BEING THE TERMINAL OF SEVEN SYSTEMS OF RAILWAYS THIS PORT RECEIVES THE TRAFFIC DRAINED BY AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF INLAND WATERWAYS WHICH CARRIES ITS INFLUENCE INTO CENTRAL EUROPE THE ELBE AND MOLDAU RIVERS NAVIGABLE FOR A DISTANCE OF 582 MILES SECURE FOR HAMBURG THE TRADE OF THE REGION AROUND THE IMPORTANT CENTERS OF MAGDEBURG DRESDEN AND PRAGUE THE SAALE HAVEL AND SPREE RIVERS DRAIN THE COMMERCE OF THURINGIA AND BERLIN WHILE THE ODERSPREE AND THE FINOW CANALS MAKE TRIBUTARY TO THIS PORT A LARGE PORTION OF THE TRADE FROM SILESIA THE WHOLE UPPER MIDDLE AND LOWER ODER AS WELL AS THE WARTHE IN 532 102PROMOTION OF COMMERCE IN GERMANY LARGE MEASURE THIS EXTENSIVE SYSTEM OF WATERWAYS IS NAVIGABLE FOR SHIPS OF 400 TONS AND IN THE MAIN DOES NOT REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF TOLLS BREMEN AS CONTRASTED WITH HAMBURG IS AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN WE CONSIDER INLAND NAVIGATION ITS INFLUENCE BEING CONFINED CHIEFLY TO THE RELATIVELY UNIMPORTANT WESER THE DUTCHBELGIAN PORTS HOWEVER DERIVE TRAFFIC FROM THE RIVERS AND CANALS OF NEARLY THE WHOLE OF NORTHWEST EUROPE BESIDES CONTROLLING THE TRADE OF THE NUMEROUS WATERWAYS OF HOLLAND AND BELGIUM THEY SHARE IN COMMON THE COMMERCE OF THE RHINE THIS RIVER IS NAVIGABLE AS FAR AS MANNHEIM A DISTANCE OF 560 KM FOR SHIPS OF I500 TONS AND TO STRASSBURG 700 KM FOR SHIPS OF 800 TONS THROUGH ITS PRINCI PAL TRIBUTARIESTHE MEUSE THE MOSEL AND THE MAINIT ALSO DRAWS TO THESE PORTS MUCH OF THE TRADE DRAINED BY THE NUMEROUS CANALS OF FRANCE AND WESTERN GERMANY THE MEUSE FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN RENDERED NAVIGABLE THROUGH CANALIZATION FOR SHIPS OF 300 TONS FOR A DISTANCE OF 600 KILOMETERS THROUGH CANALS THIS RIVER HAS ALSO BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE RHINE THE SEINE AND THE SONERHONE THUS MAKING TRIBUTARY ESPECIALLY TO ROTTERDAM MUCH OF THE TRADE FROM ALL OF NORTHERN AND EASTERN FRANCE THE MOSEL NAVIGABLE TO NANCY FOR 200 TON SHIPS IS LIKEWISE UNITED WITH THE SYSTEM OF FRENCH CANALS THE MAIN HAS BEEN CANALIZED SO AS TO BE NAVIGABLE FOR SHIPS OF I5O0 TONS AS FAR AS FRANKFORT FOR 120 TON SHIPS AS FAR AS BAMBERG AND FROM THERE HAS BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE DANUBE THROUGH THE LUDWIG CANAL PROCEEDING STILL FURTHER UP THE RHINE WE FIND THAT STRASSBURG HAS BEEN UNITED WITH THE WHOLE OF ALSACE AND WITH THE SONE AND RHONE BY MEANS OF CANALS WHICH CAN ACCOM MODATE SHIPS OF AT LEAST 200 TONS THIS EXTENDED ACCOUNT OF EXISTING WATERWAYS IS GIVEN WITH A VIEW OF SHOWING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE STATE HAS ASSISTED COM MERCE BY CONSTRUCTING CANALS AND CANALIZING RIVERS THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH AID CANNOT WELL BE OVEREMPHASIZED TRANSPORTATION BY WATER HAS DECIDED ADVANTAGES OVER TRANSPORTATION BY RAIL INSO FAR THAT CHEAP AND BULKY COMMODITIES CAN BE CARRIED MUCH MORE CHEAPLY OVER LONG DISTANCES AND SECONDLY BECAUSE TOLLS ON THOSE ARTIFICIAL WATERWAYS OF GERMANY WHICH BELONG TO THE STATE ARE LEVIED STRICTLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COST OF MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT THESE TWO ADVANTAGES OF WATER TRANSPORTATIONCHEAP CON 533 I03THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY VEYANCE FOR BULKY COMMODITIES AND A TARIFF POLICY VARYING WITH THE COST OF MAINTENANCEARE OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE IN GER MANY WHERE THE RAILWAYS CONSTITUTE A STATE MONOPOLY USED LARGELY AS A REVENUE PRODUCING AGENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT AND WHERE THE LEADING MANUFACTURING CENTERS AND THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF FUEL AND RAW MATERIAL ARE SITUATED REMOTELY FROM THE COAST THIS BE COMES ESPECIALLY APPARENT WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THAT THE RECEIPTS PER TONMILE CONCERNING THE TRAFFIC ON THE RIVERS IN GERMANY VARIES BETWEEN 0176 CT AND O519 CT AND UPON THE CANALS FROM 0346 CT TO 0692 CT4 WHEREAS FOR THE RAILWAYS THE AVERAGE EARNING PER TONMILE IN 1899 WAS ABOUT 142 CENTS ROUGHLY SPEAKING THERE FORE THE RATES ON THE RIVERS AND CANALS MAY BE SAID TO BE ABOUT ONETHIRD AS HIGH AS THOSE CHARGED ON THE RAILWAYS MOREOVER THERE IS THE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION THAT SUBSEQUENT TO 1875 THE AVERAGE RECEIPTS PER TONMILE ON THE WATERWAYS DECREASED ABOUT 50 PER CENT AS OPPOSED TO A DECREASE OF ONLY 15 PER CENT ON THE RAILWAYS5 ALONG WITH THESE LOW AND DECLINING FREIGHT RATES HAS GONE A MARVELOUS INCREASE IN TRAFFIC DURING THE TWENTY YEARS FROM 1877 TO I897 THE NUMBER OF CANAL AND RIVER BOATS INCREASED 28 PER CENT THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF THESE BOATS HOWEVER INCREASED DURING THE SAME PERIOD TO 3400000 TONS OR 143 PER CENT WHILE THE ACTUAL TRAFFIC INCREASED I59 PER CENT PRACTICALLY ALL THE RECENT CANAL PROJECTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE IN VIEW THE ACCOMMODATION OF 600 TON SHIPS WEST OF THE ODER AND 400 TONS SHIPS EAST OF THAT RIVER IN 1900 THE CANALS AND RIVERS CARRIED APPROXIMATELY 24 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL TRAFFIC OF THE COUNTRY THE AVERAGE HAUL BEING 320 KILOMETERS OR TWICE THAT ON THE RAILWAYS IT IS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE IMPORT AND EXPORT TRADE OF THE LEADING PORTS HOWEVER THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERIOR WATER WAYS HAS SHOWN ITSELF MOST PROMINENTLY BY WEIGHT ABOUT ONE HALF OF THE EXPORT TRADE TO THE DUTCH PORTS FROM THE REGION ALONG THE RHINE AND ABOUT THREEFOURTHS OF THE IMPORT TRADE MOVES BY RIVER INDEED DURING THE DECADE ENDING IN I900 THE TRADE OF ROTTER DAM BY WAY OF THE RHINE HAS NEARLY TREBLED AND AT PRESENT EXCEEDS THE RAILWAY TRAFFIC OF THE CITY BY ALMOST TWO TIMES LIKEWISE OF

OVER FOUR FIFTHS BY WEIGHT AND NEARLY THREEFIFTHS BY VALUE IS CARRIED BY WATER THESE FIGURES ILLUSTRATE THE TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE OF INLAND NAVIGATION IN DEVELOPING INDUSTRY AND IN ENLARGING THE EXPORT TRADE YET IN THE EFFORT TO EXTEND WATERROUTES TO EVERY PART OF THE EMPIRE GERMANY HAS BEEN ONLY ONE OF A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHICH ARE ALL STRIVING TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME END SOME NOTION OF THIS ACTIVITY MAY BE GAINED FROM THE STATEMENT THAT SINCE I830 BELGIUM HAS SPENT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FRANCS ON ITS INLAND WATERWAYS FRANCE ACCORDING TO ITS PROGRAMME OF I879 HAS ALREADY DEVOTED THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILLION FRANCS TOWARD THE IMPROVEMENT OF ITS RIVERS CANALS AND HARBORS WHILE AUSTRIA AND RUSSIA ARE LIKEWISE EXECUTING EXTENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THIS LINE IN GERMANY MOREOVER PROJECTS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION WHICH IF CARRIED OUT WILL ADD GREATLY TO THE 5495 KILOMETERS OF ARTIFICIAL WATER WAYS EXISTING IN THAT COUNTRY THE PRUSSIAN CANAL BILL COMMUNI CATED TO THE LANDTAG IN JANUARY 190O PROPOSED AN EXPENDITURE OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION MARKS BESIDES PROVIDING FOR THE OPENING OF THE WHOLE REGION OF SILESIA BY MEANS OF CANALS AND THE CANALIZATION OF A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT RIVERS THIS BILL EMPOWERED THE GOVERNMENT TO CONSTRUCT A RHINEWESERELBECANAL AN ODER VISTULA CANAL AND A LARGE WATERWAY BETWEEN BERLIN AND STETTIN THE ELBE AND ODER BEING ALREADY CONNECTED THIS BILL CONTEMPLATES A UNION OF THE FIVE GREAT RIVERS OF GERMANY WHICH FLOW INTO THE NORTH AND BALTIC SEAS AMONG NUMEROUS OTHER PROJECTS MAY BE MENTIONED THE PROPOSED ENLARGEMENT OF THE DANUBEMAIN CANAL AND THE PLAN OF AUSTRIA TO UNITE THE DANUBE WITH THE ELBEMOLDAU AND THE ODER IF THESE PLANS ARE REALIZED IT WILL MEAN NOT ONLY A UNION OF THE FIVE GREAT RIVERS OF NORTHERN GERMANY WITH THEIR NUMEROUS TRIBUTARIES AND BRANCH CANALS AND A CONTINUOUS WATERWAY FROM END TO END OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE BUT THROUGH THE RHINE WILL ALSO MEAN A UNION OF THESE WATERWAYS WITH THE SEINE THE SAONE AND THE RHONE MOREOVER THE DANUBE WILL BE CONNECTED THROUGH SEPARATE CANALS WITH THE RHINE THE ELBE AND THE ODER THUS CONSTI TUTING AN UNINTERRUPTED WATERROUTE FROM THE NORTH SEA TO THE BLACK SEA THE PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE TO THE REALIZATION OF THESE LARGER PLANS IS THE OPPOSITION OF THE AGRARIAN PARTY BUT GERMANY IS RAPIDLY OUTGROWING ITS AGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS AND THERE IS EVERY 535 105THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT AN IMPORTANT FORM OF STATE AID TO COMMERCE IN THE FUTURE AS IN THE PAST WILL BE THE CONSTRUCTION OF CANALS AND THE EANALIZATION OF RIVERS VI INFLUENCE OF PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY RATES IN THE FOREGOING PAGES THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN CONCERNING THE IMPROVEMENT OF HARBORS AND INTERIOR WATERWAYS IT NOW REMAINS TO DISCUSS BRIEFLY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE STATE HAS ENDEAVORED TO FACILITATE TRANSPORTATION BY RAIL OWING TO THE CENTRAL POSITION OF GERMANY IN EUROPE HER PORTS AND RAILWAYS MUST NECESSARILY COMPETE WITH THOSE OF THE SURROUNDING NATIONS TO MEET THIS COMPETITION AND TO ASSIST IN DEVELOPING HOME INDUSTRY AND THE EXPORT TRADE THE RAILWAY MANAGEMENT OF PRUSSIA HAS FROM TIME TO TIME INTRODUCED NUMEROUS SOCALLED PREFER ENTIAL RAILWAY TARIFFS IN THE MAIN THESE TARIFFS HAVE ALSO BEEN ADOPTED BY THE OTHER GERMAN STATES THE VARIOUS RAILWAY MANAGE MENTS PRESENTING IN THIS RESPECT A UNITED POLICY IN THE INTERESTS OF THE WHOLE NATION COMPARED WITH THE RATES OF OTHER LEADING EUROPEAN NATIONS THESE PREFERENTIAL TARIFFS ARE CONSPICUOUSLY LOW AND ARE APPLICABLE AT PRESENT TO NO LESS THAN 63 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL RAILWAY TONMILEAGE OF THE COUNTRY6 A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THESE PREFERENTIAL RATES SHOWS THAT THEY OPERATE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE GERMAN NORTH SEA HARBORS AS OPPOSED TO THE DUTCHBELGIAN PORTS THE RUSSIAN BLACK SEA HARBORS AND THE AUSTROHUNGARIAN PORTS ON THE ADRIATIC EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF ITS OWN SEAPORTS PRUSSIA HAS GRANTED PREFERENTIAL RATES TO HAMBURG AND BREMEN IN ORDER TO ASSIST THEM IN THEIR COMPE TITION WITH THE HARBORS OF NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST EUROPE THUS FOR EXAMPLE TO DIVERT TRAFFIC AWAY FROM THE DUTCHBELGIAN PORTS PREFERENTIAL RATES ARE GRANTED IN THE TRADE BETWEEN THE GERMAN COAST AND THE RHINEWESTPHALIAN REGION ON TOBACCO COTTON FISH COFFEE RICE AND A VARIETY OF OTHER COMMODITIES THE RATE BEING AS LOW FOR THE DISTANCE FROM ESSEN TO BREMEN AS FOR THE DISTANCE FROM ESSEN TO

OTHER INSTANCES MAY BE MENTIONED TO SHOW THAT WHERE THE INTERESTS OF GERMAN INDUSTRY OR INTERNATIONAL TRADE MAKE IT DESIRABLE THE GERMAN RAILWAY MANAGEMENTS HAVE NOT REFRAINED FROM GRANTING PREFERENTIAL TARIFFS WITHOUT REGARD TO THE NATIONALITY OF THE PORT TO ILLUSTRATE THE DUTCHBELGIAN PORTS THOUGH DERIVING A LARGE SHARE OF THEIR TRADE FROM THE INTERIOR WATERWAYS OF GERMANY ARE ALSO DEPENDENT FOR ANOTHER LARGE PORTION UPON THE RAILWAYS OF GERMANY IT IS TRUE THAT MUCH OF THEIR TRADE IS DIVERTED TO THE NORTH GERMAN COAST BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF SPECIAL RATES IN THE EXPORTATION OF SUCH COMMODITIES AS COAL GRAIN IRON AND OTHER MINERALS AND THE IMPORTATION TO SOUTHERN GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND OF PRODUCTS LIKE COFFEE TEA COCOA PEPPER AND RICE9 ONE OTHER IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE GERMAN SYSTEM OF RAIL WAY RATES REMAINS TO BE NOTICED NAMELY THE SOCALLED LEVANT AND EAST AFRICAN TRAFFIC TARIFFS ACCORDING TO THESE TARIFFS INTRO DUCED RESPECTIVELY IN I890 AND 1895 LARGELY REDUCED RATES ARE GRANTED BY THE STATE RAILWAYS TO GOODS EXPORTED FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY TO A LARGE NUMBER OF PLACES IN THE LEVANT AND EAST AFRICA AS WELL AS TO STATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL AND EAST AFRICAN RAILWAYS ASIDE FROM A REDUCTION IN THE USUAL RATES THESE TRAFFIC TARIFFS ALSO OFFER THE ADVANTAGE OF SENDING GOODS ON THROUGH BILLS OF LADING FROM THE PLACE OF DEPARTURE

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108271,ON BENZOLINE A NEW ORGANIC SALTBASE FROM BITTER ALMOND OIL,I207000, 263  IX ON BENZOLINE A NEW ORGANIC SALTBASEFROM BITTER ALMOND OIL BY GEORGE FOWNES ESQ PHD FRS RECEIVED MAY 9READ MAY 29 1845 WVHEN PURE OIL OF BITTER ALMONDS IS LEFT SOME DAYS IN CONTACT WITH A STRONG SOLU TION OF AMMONIA AT THE ORDINARY TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR IT IS SLOWLY BUT IN THE END COMPLETELY CONVERTED INTO A WHITE CRYSTALLINE SUBSTANCE INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT READILY SOLUBLE IN HIOT ALCOHOL THE SOLIDIFICATION OF THE OIL IS COMPLETE AND THERE IS NO SECONDARY PRODUCT THIS SUBSTANCE WAS EXAMINED BY M LAURENT WHO CON FERLRED UPON IT THE NAME OF HYDROBENZAMIDE AND ASSIGNED TO IT THE FORNMULA C42 IHI8 N2 IT IS GENERATED BY THE UNION OF THE ELEMENTS OF TWO EQUIVALENTS OF AMMONIA WITH THOSE OF THREE EQUIVALENTS OF HYDRURET OF BENZOYLE AND THE SEPARATION OF SIX EQUIVALENTS OF WATER 3 EQ BITTER ALMOND OIL  C42 HS 06 F HYDROBENZAMIDE C42 HS

THE CASE IS DIFFERENT SOLUTION OF POTASH EVEN AT A BOILING HEAT OCCASIONING AS REMARKED BY M LAURENT NO PERCEP TIBLE CHANGE I FOUND HOWEVER THAT WHEN THE BOILING WAS PROLONGED FOR SOME HOURS A CHANGE WAS INDUCED RESEMBLING THAT UNDERGONE BY FURFUROLAMIDET UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES A FEW BROWNISH CRYSTALLINE FLOCKS APPEAR IN THE SOLUTION AND AFTER COOLING THE CAKE OF RESINLIKE SUBSTANCE IS FOUND HARDER AND LESS FUSIBLE THAN HYDRO BENZAMIDE WHICH HAS BEEN NIELTED AND LEFT TO SOLIDIFY THIS CHANGE IS UNACCOMPANIED BY ANY NOTABLE ALTERATION OF WEIGHT ALTHOUGH A FAINT ODOUR OF BITTER ALMOND OIL IS DISENGAGED DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE EBULLITION THE NEW SUBSTANCE IS AN OLGANIC SALTBASE HAVING THE SAME COMPOSITION AS HYDROBENZALNIDE ITSELF IT MIGHT PERHAPS WITH PROPRIETY BE CALLED BENZOLINE THE SALTS FORMED BY THIS SUBSTANCE ARE FOR THE MOST PART REMARKABLE FOR SPARING SOLUBILITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ACETATE THE HYDROCHLORATE THE NITRATE AND THE SULPHATE ARE CRYSTALLIZABLE THE LASTNAMED SALT IS EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL CRYSTALLIZING FIROM AN ACID SOLUTION IN COLOURLESS PRISMS RESEMBLING THOSE OF OXALIC ACID PRECIPITATED BY AMMONIA FROM A COLD SOLUTION OF THE HYDROCHLORATE OR SULPHATE T SEE PRECEDING PAPER  ANN CHIM ET PHYS 62 P 23AIR G FOWNES ON BENZOLINE A NEW ORGANIC BENZOLINE SEPARATES IN WHITE CURDY MASSES WHICH WHEN WASHED AND DRIED DIMINISHED GREATLY IN VOLUME WHEN QUITE DRY THE POWDER IS SINGULARLY ELECTRIC  IF RUBBED WITH A SPATULA ITS PARTICLES REPEL EACH OTHER WITH VIOLENCE SCATTERING THE POWDER OVER THE PAPER ON WHICH IT LIES IT IS NOT SENSIBLY SOLUBLE IN WATER BUT DISSOLVES WITH GREAT EASE IN ALCOHOL AND ETHER A HOT ALCOHOLIC SOLUTION LEFT FOR SOME TIME DEPOSITS THE BASE IN BRILLIANT TRANSPARENT COLOURLESS CRYSTALS WHICH APPARENTLY HAVE THE FORM OF SQUARE PRISMS WITH VARIOUSLYTERMINATED SUMMITS THE ALCOHOLIC SOLUTION IS STRONGLY ALKALINE TO TESTPAPER AT A TEMPERATURE BELOW 212 BENZOLINE MELTS AND ON COOLING ASSUMES A TRANSPARENT GLASSY STATE WITHOUT ANY TENDENCY TO CRYSTALLIZATION HEATED IN A RETORT IT BOILS AND AT LENGTH ENTIRELY VOLATILIZES WITH SCARCELY A RESIDUE OF CHAR COAL AMMONIA IS DISENGAGED DURING THE DISTILLATION A HIGHLY VOLATILE OILY LIQUID HAVING THE ODOUR OF BENZINE COLLECTS IN THE RECEIVER AND A CRYSTALLINE SOLID MATTER CONDENSES IN THE NECK OF THE RETORT THIS LATTER SUBSTANCE WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE MOST ABUNDANT PRODUCT HAS BEEN BUT PARTIALLY EXAMINED  ITTIS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER THE NAME PYROBENZOLINE THE ACTION OF OXIDIZING AGENTS UPON BENZOLINE IS REMARKABLE WHEN HEATED IN A RETORT WITH A MIXTURE OF BICHROMATE OF POTASH SULPHURIC ACID AND WATER IT IS ATTACKED WITH GREAT ENERGY THE MIXTURE BECOMES DARK GREEN AND ON DISTILLATION BENZOIC ACID IN LARGE QUANTITY PASSES OVER WITH THE VAPOUR OF WATER WITH NITRIC ACID THE SAME CHANGE SEEMS TO OCCUR BUT THE ACTION IS NOT SO DEFINITE AND SPEEDY HYDRO BENZAMIDE UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES YIELDS THE SAME PRODUCT ACCOMPANIED HOW EVER IN THE FIRST PART

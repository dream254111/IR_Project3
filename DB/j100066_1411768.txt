Manhood By DAVID IRVINE London 1897 pp 281 Wagner said this contained his entire view of the world and that it was essentially at variance with established conceptions He is like Browning in the

weakness are in every ray of light whirlwinds of dust etc Stars are sylphlike dreams in gnomelike nightmares and many are personified as Gabriel Michael Raphael and Sabaoth They were invoked by many conjuration formulae and the letters of the names were full of symbolism and names and letters sub jected to many forms of permutation and combination In all there are over 3000 of these terms 55

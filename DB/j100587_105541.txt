HORNSBY M A AND SAVILIAN PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY AT OXFORD,I206919,145 XXV OBSERVATIONS ON THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN APRIL 1 1764 IN A LETTER TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JAMES EARL OF MORTON PRES R S FROM THE REVEREND THOMAS HORNSBY M A AND SAVILIAN PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY AT OXFORD MY LORD I TAKE THE LIBERTY TO TRANSMIT TO YOUR LORDSHIP THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS OF THE GREAT ECLIPSE OF THE SUN ON THE 1ST OF APRIL LAST IN HOPES THAT YOUR LORDSHIP MAY THINK THEM NOT UN WORTHY OF THE ATTENTION OF THAT LEARNED BODY OVER WHICH YOU PRESIDE READ MAY 10 1764 ON THE MORNING OF THE 1ST OF APRIL THE HEAVENS WERE SO UNCOMMONLY SERENE THAT I COULD NOT BUT FLAT TER MYSELF WITH THE HOPES OF A SKY VERY FAVOURABLE TO OBSERVATION BUT ABOUT EIGHT OCLOCK A HAZINESS BEGAN TO APPEAR AND SEVERAL CLOUDS TO ARISE FROM THE SOUTHWEST WHICH AT SMALL INTERVALS DEPRIVED US OF A SIGHT OF THE SUN THESE CLOUDS HOWEVER WENT OFF ENTIRELY TO THE NORTHEAST AND THE SUNS LIMB APPEAR ED VERY NICELY DEFINED AND WITHOUT THE LEAST UNDU LATION THROUGH AN EXCELLENT REFRACTING TELESCOPE OF 12 FEET FOCUS MADE BY MR BIRD TO WHICH HAD BEEN AP PLIED A SYSTEM OF EYEGLASSES SIMILAR TO THOSE USED FOR REFLECTORS AND THE USUAL APERTURE OF WHICH HAD BEEN INCH CONTRACTED TO 1 2 I CONTINUED TO KEEP MY EYE VERY ATTENTIVELY FIXED UPON THAT PART OF THE SUNS LIMB V O L LIV U WHERE146 WHERE I EXPECTED THE MOON WOULD MAKE THE FIRST IM PRESSION AND AT 8H 59 33 APPARENT TIME SAW A VERY SLIGHT ALTERATION ON THE SUNS LIMB WHICH I FLAT TER MYSELF MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE TIME OF THE BE GINNING OF THE ECLIPSE VERY ACCURATELY ASCERTAINED SINCE A GENTLEMAN THEN PRESENT WITH A REFLECTING TE ELESCOPE OF 18 INCHES SAW THAT THE ECLIPSE WAS BEGUN ABOUT 6 LATER BY THE SAME CLOCK AS THE ECLIPSE ADVANCED I PROPOSED TO MEASURE BOTH CHORDS AND THE QUANTITY OF THE LUCID PARTS WITH A REFLECTING TELESCOPE OF 9 INCHES ARMED WITH A MI CROMETER EXECUTED BY MR DOLLOND HIMSELF AND WHICH WAS VERY OBLIGINGLY LEFT ME FOR THAT PURPOSE BY MY WORTHY COLLEGUE THE REVEREND MR BLISS AND AC CORDINGLY AT 9H 37 17 APPARENT TIME AS ARE ALL THE TIMES HEREAFTER MENTIONED I MEASURED THE CHORD OF THE PART ECLIPSED AND FOUND IT  25 45 8 AT 9H 50 24 THE UNOBSCURED PART OF THE SUN WAS  13 17 7 AND AT 10H 3 39  8 33 8 AT THE TIME OF WHICH OBSERVATION THE COLOUR OF THE SKY WAS REMARKABLY CHANGED AT 10H 19 15 I DETERMINED BY THE OLD MICRO METER APPLIED TO THE 12 FOOT TUBE THE QUANTITY OF THE LUCID PARTS TO BE 3 45 BUT AS I FOUND SUCH MEA SUREMENTS COULD NOT BE TAKEN WITH THAT INSTRUMENT WITHOUT GREAT DIFFICULTY I IMMEDIATELY ENDEAVOURED TO DETERMINE BY THE OTHER MICROMETER THE QUANTITY OF THE MOONS HORIZONTAL DIAMETER AS SEEN UPON THE SUN AND FOUND IT BY A MEAN OF THREE OBSERVATIONS HARDLY DIFFERING FROM EACH OTHER TO BE 29 45 1 IT WAS FORMERLY A DISPUTE AMONG THE ASTRONOMERS WHETHER THE MOONS DIAMETER DID NOT APPEAR LESS WHEN VIEWED UPON THE SUN THAN WHEN SEEN UPON A DARKER147 DARKER GROUND THE OBSERVATIONS OF MR LE MON NIER IN SCOTLAND IN THE YEAR 1748 SEEMED TO LEAVE LITTLE ROOM FOR DOUBT AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT OB SERVATIONS MADE WITH LARGER AND BETTER INSTRUMENTS THAN MINE AND IN PLACES WHERE THE ECLIPSE WAS AN NULAR OR NEARLY SO WILL FULLY SETTLE THIS POINT AT THE TIME OF THE MIDDLE HERE THE MOONS CENTRE WAS ABOUT 39 DEGREES HIGH AND THEREFORE THE MOON AP PEARED UNDER A GREATER ANGLE TO THE EYE OF THE OBSERVER THAN IF SEEN FROM THE EARTHS CENTER BY ABOUT 18 SE CONDS THE TRUE HORIZONTAL DIAMETER FROM THE ABOVE OBSERVATIONS WAS THEREFORE 29 27 WHICH IS BUT 7 LESS THAN ACCORDING TO THE LATEST AND BEST TABLES WHICH TABLES MAY PERHAPS GIVE THE MOONS DIAMETER TOO LARGE BECAUSE CONSTRUCTED FROM OBSERVATIONS MADE WITH REFRACTING TELESCOPES THROUGH WHICH THE DIAME TERS BOTH OF THE SUN AND MOON MUST NECESSARILY APPEAR UNDER AN ANGLE SOMEWHAT ENLARGED ABOUT THE TIME OF THE MIDDLE OF THE ECLIPSE I CARE FULLY ATTENDED TO THE DISTANCE OF THE CUSPS BECAUSE FROM SOME CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN LAID BEFORE THE PUBLIC THE NORTHERN LIMIT OF THE ANNULUS WAS TO PASS WITHIN 4 OR 5 MILES OF THIS PLACE AND BY OTHER ACCOUNTS I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND MYSELF CONSIDERABLY WITHIN THE PATH OF THE ANNULAR PENUM BRA BUT AS NEARLY AS I COULD ESTIMATE BY MY EYE THE DISTANCE OF THE CUSPS WAS NOT LESS THAN 27 OF THE WHOLE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE SUN THE QUANTITY OF THE SUNS LIGHT WAS NOW VERY SENSIBLY DIMINISHED A VERY DISTINCT HALO WAS SEEN AT THE DISTANCE OF 12 OR 14 DEGREES ROUND THE SUN AND WE MIGHT HAVE EX PECTED TO HAVE SEEN THE PLANET VENUS HAD NOT THE SKY BEEN COVERED WITH A CONSIDERABLE HAZINESS AS U 2 THIS148 THIS HAZINESS CONTINUED I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT I MIGHT BE PREVENTED FROM OBSERVING THE END AND THEREFORE MEASURED AS CAREFULLY AS UNFAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD PERMIT THE FOLLOWING CHORDS H AT 11 33 56 CHORD  19 52 5 11 40 25   16 27 9 11 42 7   15 28 5 11 45 7   13 46 0 11 46 57   12 9 4 BUT THE SKY BEGAN TO CLEAR UP AND AT 11H 58 3 BY THE CLOCK OR 11H 54 2012 APPARENT TIME I OB SERVED THE END WHICH I BELIEVE MAY BE DEPENDED UPON TO 3 OR 4 SECONDS ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER THE SUN HAD PASSED THE MERIDIAN I MEASURED THE SUNS HORIZONTAL DIAMETER WITH DOLLONDS MICROMETER AND FOUND IT  32 0 8 AT SEVEN OCLOCK IN THE MORNING A FAHRENHEITS THERMOMETER MADE BY MR BIRD AND PLACED IN THE SHADE STOOD AT 4212 DEGREES AT 7H 32 I EXPOSED ANOTHER THERMOMETER OF THE SAME SCALE TO THE DIRECT RAYS OF THE SUN IN FIVE MINUTES THE MERCURY ROSE FROM 43 TO 59 AT 7H 44 IT STOOD AT 6712 AND A BOUT TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THE ECLIPSE BEGAN THIS THERMOMETER HAD RISEN EVEN TO 84 DURING149 DURING THE TIME OF THE ECLIPSE THE FOLLOWING OBSER VATIONS WERE MADE ON EACH THERMOMETER APPARENT TIME THERMOMETER THERMOMETER H IN THE SHADE IN THE SUN AT 9 11 53 62 9 30 53 9 38 5314 7012 9 52 5234 69 10 14 5114

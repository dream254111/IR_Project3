Communications with reference to CONTENTS should be addressed to the EDITOR at University Station Charlottesville Va BUSINESS communications to the PUB LISHERS WITH this number we close our Vth volume The accompanying volume index was prepared by H A Minor Jr of the Lynchburg bar OUR readers will doubtless be interested in the portraits of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia presented as a frontispiece with this number We doubt if any State of the Union can make a finer show of judicial faces WE are in receipt of the prospectus of a new law journal to be published at Raleigh North Carolina under the editorship of Paul Jones Esq of Tarboro in the same State The journal is to be known as the North Carolina Law Journal and the first number is promised during the month of April Up to this time we believe that Virginia and West Virginia are the only Southern States in which law journals are published We are glad to see our North Carolina brethren moving in that direction The REGISTER will extend a cordial welcome to its new neighbor We learn that a similar publication is projected in Georgia to be published in Atlanta A law journal in every State of the Union would work a great advance in our system of jurisprudence THE Bombay Lawv Reporter has enlarged its scope and plan by adding editorial and other matter to its reports of cases We have found the latter chiefly valuable for the athletic exercise derived froni an endeavor to pronounce the names of the parties For instance Khandubhai Gulabbhai v Pirbhai Klhakhibhai in which Mr Daji Abaji Khare appeard for the appellant and Mr Manekshah Jehangir shah and Messrs Daftari and Ferreira for the respondents In Jethabhaci Veharidas v Goridhan IKirpahankar we find a famniliarprinciple laid down that a a right to pass filthy and other water on the land of another can be acquired by immemorial user The February number before us contains much interesting matter including many notices of American cases BY a joint resolution of the two houses the legislature of Virginia at its recent session requested the State Board of Health and Vital Statistics to report to the next session of the legislature whether or not in their opinion some mode of inflicting the death penalty more humane and approved by science than the mode by hanging is prac ticable and also as to the advisability of having all such executions performed at some particular place in the State to be selected for that purpose Acts 18991900 p 513 It is therefore within the bounds of probability that Virginia may follow the lead of New York in executing criminals by electrocution The New York method seems to have given entire satisfaction to humanitarians and scientists How the electrocuted like it is not re corded ELSEWHERE will be found a synopsis of some of the more impor tant statutes passed at the recent session of the Virginia legislature The list is not exhaustive since the volume of Acts is yet unpublished and we have been able to examine only such advance sheets as had been issued up to the time the synopsis was prepared and of those examined we have selected only such as seem to be of special interest to the bar There was at this session radical legislation affecting the married woman and her estate and we had hoped to be able to publish this in full with comments in this number but were not able to procure copies in time We hope to do this in our May number From our examination of some of the acts on this subject the married woman seems to have been completely emancipated so far as concerns her property rights and powers of contract After Hirth v Hirth how ever we guess with caution WE commend to our readers a careful perusal of the paper by Mr Pettit published as the leading article in this number The paper is a criticism of the recent decision of the Virginia Court of Appeals in Patterson v Crawford the opinion in which case was published in full in our January number5 Va Law Reg 611 Mr Pettits point is that the courts reasoning does not accord with 859 1900 EDITORIAL860 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April its decision that while declaring the principle that the debtor cannot be held responsible for the receivers default resulting in a loss of the funds into which the debtors property had been converted and the latter be made to pay his debts twice the practical effect of the de cision is in fact to throw the burden of the loss on the debtor The argument is briefly this If there had been no other creditors than the five preferred lienors and the funds in the receivers hands sufficient to pay all these liens had been lost by the receivers de fault these debts must have been regarded as paid and although there were enough property still remaining in the debtor to pay such debts these creditors could not have had recourse against it because this would in effect have required the debtor to pay twice The fact that this remaining property was encumbered with other debtsdue to other creditors than the five mentionedcould on principle make no difference in the result Yet by the decision of the cjurt these five preferred creditors are let in on other property of the debtor and the inferior creditors are displaced for that purpose with the apparent right on the part of the latter to still look to the debtor for payment whereas if there had been no such inferior creditors the debts of the superior creditors would have perished with the loss of the funds in the receivers hands This reasoning is difficult to answer IN Stuart v Pennis 91 Va 688 it was held by a unanimous court that a contract in writing for the sale of growing trees is specifically enforceable rhe lower court had held otherwise on a demurrer to the bill but on appeal this decision was reversed and the demurrer overruled The correctness of the ruling on the demurrer was the only point involved in the appeal Judge Riely who delivered the opinion quoted the contract in full and entered into a full discussion of the question While conceding that the authorities are conflicting the court reached the conclusion that on reason and by the weight of authority such a contract is in substance a contract relating to realty and is therefore specifically enforceable Subsequently the case came before the court again apparently on precisely the same point On this second appeal the court apparently overrules its former decision without assigning any reasons and with out distinctly repudiating the former decision Judge Riely did not take part in the decision The conclusion is announced in the follow ing memorandum by Cardwell J In this case which is a sequel of the case of Stuart v Pennis 91Va 688 the court being equally divided as to the right of the appel lant to have a decree for the specific performance of the contract in his bill mentioned no opinion has been prepared but it appearing to the court that the decree dismissing the bill should have been without prejudice to the right of appellant to bring his action at law upon said contract if he be so advised the decree appealed from will be amended in this respect and as amended will be affirmed with costs to appellee 33 S E 1015 It will be observed that the point decided on the latter appeal was that while the plaintiff might have a remedy at law on the contract there was none in equity No reference is made to the opposite con clusion on the former appeal and it is not clear whether the former ruling was intended to be reversed or not When these two decisions are put side by side the law of the subject in Virginia is left in rather an unsatisfactory condition WE are indebted to a learned but modest correspondent who prefers not to be mentioned by name for calling our attention to the fact that the views expressed in the editorial note to Rowe v Hardy 5 Va Law Reg 672 with respect to keeping judgments perpetually alive by issuing execution under Va Code sec 3577 have not been uniformly accepted He calls attention to two articles by Mr Samuel D Davies of the Richmond bar published in 15 Virginia Law Journal pp 273 and 377 in which these views are controverted and papers in the same volume pp 341 and 445 by C E Nicol now Judge Nicol of Manassas maintaining the views expressed by the REGISTER and also to an unreported decision by the circuit court of the Sixth judicial circuit adverse to these views We are indebted to the same source for a reference to 2 Bartons Law Practice 790 note where this learned author expresses the opinion that a judgment may be perpetually revived if execution is continually renewed or scire facias or action be brought in due time We agree with our correspondent that the report of the revisors of the Code of 1849 seems to settle the question in favor of the views we have expressed Referring to section 11 of ch 186 Code of 1849 now embodied in sec 3577 of the Code of 1887 and to that por tion of the section which provides that  where execution issues within the year other executions may be issued     within ten years from the return day of an execution on which there is no return by an 1900 861 EDITORIAL862 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April officer or within twenty years from the return day of an execution on which there is such return the revisors say There is now no limitation in such case Although a return of no effects tends to repel a presumption of payment it is deemed not unreasonable that a creditor who wishes to preserve his execution in force after twenty years should take out another execution before the end of that time Report of Revisors p 920 We know of no authoritative decision on the subject If there be such we shall esteem it a favor if some of our readers will bring it to our attentionor preferably will favor us with a discussion for pub lication THE Canada Law Journal calls attention to a recent English de cision Consolidated Exploration Co v Musgrave 1900 1 Ch 37 in which the court appears to have held that securities placed in the hands of bail in a criminal case for his indemnity by a third person may be recovered on the ground that a contract to indemnify bail in a criminal case is contrary to the policy of the law and therefore in valid It seems to be well settled that there is no implied contract by the principal to indemnify his bail in a criminal case As said by Mr Justice Bradley in United States v Ryder 110 U S 729 to imply a contract of indemnity and to subrogate the surety to the rights of the government would render the surety less vigilant and relieve him of the motives to exert himself in securing the appearance of the principal Whether the same principle applies to an express contract by the prisoner or by a third person to indemnify the bail in case he shall incur the penalty of the bond by the prisoners default is not so clear on authority On principle there can be no sound distinction made between an implied and an express contract in such case or be tween cases where the promise of indemnity is made by the prisoner and where made by a third person The purpose of the bail bond is to secure the prisoners presence in court at the time fixed in the bond By denying the right of the bail to take indemnity his vigilance is secured and quickened and there is no inducement held out to him to relax his efforts to secure the prisoners appearance On principle therefore it cannot matter where the indemnity comes froti or how it ariseswhether from an implied or an express promise or from the prisoner or a third person In Cripps v Hartnoll 4 Best  S 116 E C I  414 there was anexpress parol promise by a father to indemnify the surety on a bail bond for his daughter accused of crime and the action by the bail against the father on this promise was sustained But the question whether the contract was against public policy was not raisedthe case going off on the question of the Statutes of Frauds The court does how ever decide that there was no implied promise on the part of the prisoner to indemnify the bail and hence that the promise of the father was original but the illegality of such a promise or a similar promise by a third person is not once referred to In Jones v Orchard 16 C B 81 E C L 614 it is held that there may be a valid indemnity to bail for costs and expenseswith an intimation that this is as far as the law will permit the indemnity whether on an express or implied contract In Herman v Jetchner L R 15 Q B Div 561 the bail bond was for the good behavior of the prisoner He deposited funds with the bail to indemnify him against loss In an action by the principal to recover the deposit such a transaction was declared to be illegal  because it takes away the protection which the law affords for secur ing the good behavior of the plaintiff When a man is ordered to find bail and a surety becomes responsible for him the surety is bound at his peril to see that his principal obeys the order of the court   But if money to the amount for which the surety is bound be deposited with him as indemnity against any loss which he may sustain by reason of his principals conduct the surety has no interest in taking care that the condition of the recognizance is performed This case is express authority for the proposition that a contract by the prisoner to indemnify the bail is contrary to public policy and invalid In United States v Simmons 47 Fed 575 14 L R A 78 it is held that persons who have been indemnified by the accused thereby disqualify themselves from being accepted as bailon the ground that such a transaction is contrary to public policy Whether the contract of indemnity in this case were enforceable or not was not before the court for decisionbut the court strongly condemns it and though ex pressing the opinion that it was not enforceable the court nevertheless held that the taking of the indemnity indicated a lack of confidence in the power or disposition of the bail to produce the prisoner at the proper time and an unlawful effort to provide indemnity for them selves in that event There are two American cases which appear to be opposed to the doctrine that bail cannot recover ilndemniity of the principalReynolds 1900 863 EDITORIALVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER v Harral 2 Strob So Car 87 and Simpson v Robert 35 Ga 183 Both of these are cited in U S v Ryder supra The first is critized by Mr Justice Bradley as being based on a nisi prius Eng lish decision long since overruled in England and the second is curi ously enough approved as in accord with Cripps v Hartnoll supra In the Georgia case thus approved by Mr Justice Bradley the facts were that the principal executed a mortgage to the bail as indemnity and the mortgage was sustainedthe court saying that the duty of the principal to indemnify his bail against the effects of the forfeiture has never been doubted by anybody and no authority is offered to the contrary Mr Justice Bradleys opinion clearly indicates that he understood the law to be that while there can be no implied contract of indemnity there may be an express oneand he cites Cripps v Hartloll supra as authority for this proposition But as shown the validity of the express contract was not raised in the latter case except as it was affected by the Statute of Fraudseither in the Queens Bench 2 Best  S 110 E C L 697 or on appeal in the Exchequer Cham ber 4 Best  S 116 E C L 414 The Georgia case therefore confessedly decided without examination of the authorities and on the belief expressed by the court that the right to indemnity has never been doubted by anybody can scarcely be regarded authoritative outside of the local jurisdiction Harp v Osgood 2 Hill N Y 216 sometimes cited in this con nection is not in point From these authorities the conclusion seems to be justified that a contract to indemnify bail in a criminal case is never implied by law save as to costs and expenses properly incurred by the bail and that an express contract to indemnify bail whether made by the prisoner or by a third person is invalid as contrary to public policy SEVERAL questions of apparent difficulty affecting rights of priority as between a conveyance and a judgment arise under the provisions of chapter 109 of the Code regulating the registry of deeds and sec tion 3570 touching the docketing of judgments These questions may have been judicially settled but not to our knowledge We call at tention to them in the hope that some of our subscribers may be in duced to discuss them through the columns of the REGISTER Sec 2465 of the Virginia Code declares in substance that every deed conveying real estate shall be void as to subsequent purchasers 864 Aprilfor value without notice and creditors until and except from the time that it is duly admitted to record By a subsequent section 2467 amended by Acts 18956 p 285 it is declared that if the deed not being a deed of trust or mortgage be admitted to record within ten days from the date of its acknowledgment before a notary or other officer such registry shall afford the same protection as if made on the day of such acknowledgment It is further provided by section 2470 that the word creditors in this connection shall embrace all creditors who but for the deed would lhave a right to subject the property to their debts Turning now to sec 3570 regulating the docketing of judgments This section provides that  no judgment shall be a lien on real estate as against a purchaser thereof for valuable consideration without no tice unless it be docketed according to the provisions of this chapter either within twenty days next after the date of such judgment or fifteen days before the conveyance of said estate to such pur chaser  The following cases seem to present difficulty 1 January 1 1897 Conveyance A to B July 1 1897 Judgment C v A September 1 1897 Bs deed recorded October 1 1897  Cs judgment docketed Who has priority B or C  When B failed to record his conveyance within ten days or at any time before C obtained his judgment the conveyance was clearly void as to this judgment But what is the effect of Cs failure to docket his judgment either within twenty days after its date or fifteen days before the conveyance to B the latter impossible in view of the fact that Bs conveyance was prior in date  Does the term  purchasers in sec tion 3570 refer to subsequent purchasers only  And purchasers who have recorded their conveyances according to the provisions of section 2465 Again 2 January 1 1897 Judgment C v A July 1 1897 Conveyance A to Bwithout notice September 1 1897 Cs judgment docketed October 1 1897 Bs deed recorded TWhich now has priority  By failure to docket his judgment within twenty days irom its date 19001 865 EDITORIAL866 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April or within fifteen days before the conveyance to B this judgment would seem to be void as to B But when B likewise failed to record his deed within ten days or at any time before the docketing of the judg ment his deed would seem to be void as to the judgment In other words there appears to be the paradoxical situation of each claim be ing void as to the other The question presents itself somewhat in this form When it is de clared that a conveyance is void as to creditors until recorded is the real meaning that it shall be void as to creditors who docket their judg ments as provided by section 3570  Or when it is declared by the latter section that an undocketed judgment shall be void as to pur chasers does the statute mean purchasers who record their conveyances within twenty days from date or who record at any time before the judgment is docketed  Or is it meant that by failure to docket the judgment the creditor loses his lien as against all subsequent but not prior purchasers  Or again reading sections 2465 and 3570 together where both the purchaser and the judgment creditor have failed to record or docket within the time prescribed is the effect of the combined sections to give priority to him who is lfterwards most diligent in the matter of registry or docketing  3 A case of even more difficulty is presented in the following January 1 1897 Judgmnent C v A January 25 1897 Cs judgment docketed January 27 1897 Deed of trust A to B January 28 1897  Bs deed of trust recorded Here not having been docketed within twenty days after its date nor within fifteen days before the execution of the deed of trust sup posed to have been taken without notice of the judgment the judg ment was by express provision of sec 3570 void as to the deed of trust at the moment of the latters execution But by the provisions of secs 2465 and 2467 the deed of trust is void as to all creditors including therefore C until recorded Not having been recorded immediately there was an interval between its date January 27 and its recordation January 28 during which time B the deed of trust creditor was in default And when his deed of trust is on January 28 placed on record Cs judgment is already on the lien docket Is B to be postponed to C or vice versa If B in such case is to be postponed to C because of the interval of twentyfour hours duringwhich he was in default the same result would seem to follow where the interval between the date of execution of the deed of trust and its recordation was but the necessary few minutes required for trans mission to the clerks office So it would follow in this view of the case where the judgment is docketed but not within the prescribed time that although the judgment creditor is within the condem nation of sec 3570 a subsequent deed of trust must always be postponed to such a judgment because the former is as to the judg ment without validity until actually admitted to recordin this re spect differing from an ordinary conveyance which has ten days of grace for purpose of registry And on the other hand if recordation of the deed of trust within twentyfour hours is sufficient to give priority to B the deed of trust creditor would not the same priority result if he recorded within twentyfour daysor twentyfour monthsor within any other imagin able time  If so then need B record his deed of trust at all so far as C is concerned  Has not C lost his priority absolutely so soon as B takes his deed of trust without actual notice of the judgment where the latter not being docketed within the prescribed time is void as to the deed of trust at the instant when the latter is executed  Does B in such case owe any duty of recordation to C  In this connection see opinion by Burks J in Davis v Beazley 75 Va 491 where it is held that a subsequent purchaser owes no duty of recordation to a prior purchaser Again what is meant by the date of the judgment in the provision of section 3570 that a judgment shall not be a lien as against a bona fide purchaser unless it be docketed  within twenty days next after the date of such judgment  Is it by relation the first day of the term according to the ordinary rule or is it the ac tual date on which the judgment is entered  If the former the judg ment creditor might lose the benefit of his lien by a sale of the prop erty during the term where the judgment is entered after the twentieth day of the term It follows under this view that if the judgment were entered on the twentyfirst day of the term and were at once docketed the judgment creditor would be liable to be postponed to any bona fide purchaser who bought either during the term or within the next fifteen days thereafter Does not the statute use the word  date  as meaning the actual date on which the judgment is entered  We do not mean to express an opinion on the questions suggested Indeed we are but in the doubting stage and have reached no satis factory conclusion Will some one who has made or is willing to make a study of these questions give us and through us our readers the benefit of his in vestigations  1900 867

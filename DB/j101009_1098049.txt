j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098049,Voluntary Conveyances Void and Voidable Subsequent Consideration,i245871,62 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May or no evidence doubt mistrust and so the adjective term suspicious descriptive of the quality or condition of a person as well the party suspecting as the party suspected is defined as apt to imagine with little or no reason distrustful liable or open to suspicion exciting suspicion giving reasons or grounds to suspect or imagine ill   A suspicious character however does not constitute crime nor does it justify the government in treating the party having such reputation as a criminal with out connecting him with some criminal act or conduct   It would seem to be clear that the offense as described in the statute and in the information is not such as will justify seizure and imprisonment of the party accused Under the Constitution of the United States Articles IV and VIII of the Amendments every person is intended to be secure in his person against unreasonable searches and seizures and against cruel and unusual punishments and it would clearly be a cruel and unnatural punishment to impose fine and imprisonment upon a party because he might happen to be regarded by some persons as a suspicious person without anything more VOLUNTARY CONVEYANCES VOID AND VOIDABLESUBSEQUENT CON SIDERATIONRecurring to the editorial note in the REGISTER for February 1900 page 709 on the case of Taylor v Mallory reported in 96 Va 18 a correspon dent sends us a note of a decision of the Chancery Court of the city of Richmond made in 1894 in the case of Norris v Jones The case went to the Supreme Court of Appeals where the decision was affirmed it is reported in 93 Va 176 and in 2 Va Law Reg 96 The following extracts from the opinion of Judge Lamb who decided the case in the Chancery Court throw some light on the general sub ject of voluntary conveyances and are of additional interest when read in con nection with the criticisms published in 2 Va Law Reg 241 by the late R G H Kean on the decision of the case in the Supreme Court of Appeals Judge Lamb said 1 I am of opinion that the word void used in sec 2459 Code 1887 which declares that every gift c which is not upon consideration deemed valuable in law    shall be void as to creditors whose debts shall have been con tracted at the time it was made must be construed as used in the sense of  voidable Such was the meaning given to the word  void at common law when used in connection with voluntary conveyances See Hutchison v Kelly 1 Rob 131 Huston v Cantril 11 Leigh 142 The statute was first enacted at the revisal of 1849 to set at rest a question which had been much discussed in the cases above cited and in other Virginia cases on the same subject In that discussion Judge Baldwin and other judges had held to the opinion that a voluntary conveyance the grantor being indebted at the time was only prima face void as to such debts and might be made valid or the presumption repelled by reference to the motives and circumstances of the grantor at the time of its execution On the other hand Judge Stanard main tained that such a conveyance was constructively fraudulent as to such debts and that the legal presumption of fraud could not be repelled by showing the motives and circumstances of the grantor In all those cases the word void was always used in the sense of voidable NOTES OF CASES and therefore I think that the rule of construction requires that the legislature shall be taken to have used it in that sense 1 Tucker Com p 13 Endlich on Statutes sees 3 127 See also Waite on Fraudulent Conveyances secs 317 408 445 In Johnston v Gill 27 Gratt 587 592 Judge Staples says of the statute  This provision excludes all inquiry into the motives and circumstances of the grantor it adopts the views of Judge Stanard in Hutchison v Kelly 1 Rob 131 and he might have added in Hunters v Waite 3 Gratt 25 and of Ch Kent in Reade v Livingston 3 John Ch R 481 500 that if the grantor be in debted at the time of the voluntary settlement it is presumed to be fraudulent in respect to such debts and no circumstances will permit those debts to be affected by the settlement or repel the legal presumption of fraud The effect of the statute is to disable the debtor from making any voluntary settlement of his estate to stand in the way of his creditors whose debts were contracted at the time It must be borne in mind that the  circumstances  here referred to are such as surrounded the grantor at the time of the execution of the deed not such as may have arisen subsequently The true rule is thus clearly stated in Hageman v Buchanan 45 N J Eq 292 14 Am St Rep 732 733 Neither the motive which induced the deed nor the solvency of the grantor at the time of its execution nor any other circumstances which might bear upon the bona fides of the parties to the conveyance is important 2 I am further of opinion that a deed which is voidable merelywhich is merely constructively fraudulentmay be rendered valid by matter ex post facto and will be allowed to stand as security for what is justly due to the grantee or for advances made subsequently to its execution Henderson v Hunton 26 Gratt 826 934 et seq and cases cited Huston v Cantril 11 Leigh 142 Waite Fraud Conv sec 192 etc 3 I am further of opinion that in the case of a conveyance merely voluntary where the evidence shows an entire absence of any fraudulent intent if the gran tee before the creditors of the grantor bring suit or take any steps to set aside the conveyance restore the property to the grantor or in good faith pay bona fide debts of the grantor or if the grantee make an advancement or loan to the grantor so closely connected with the original conveyance by time or by circumstances as to make it probable that the latter was an inducement to the former equity will hold the grantee acquitted in whole or in part accordingly as the property re stored or the debt paid or the advancement or loan is greater or less than the original gift I think that this follows as a necessary consequence from the princi ple above laid down See the cases cited in Henderson v Hunton supra at p 934 et seq see also Hutchins v Sprague 4 N H 477 Huston v Cantril supra EXTRATERRITORIAL SERVICE OF PROCESSIn Roller v Holly 20 Sup Ct 410 February 26 1900 it was held by the Supreme Court of the United States that personal service on nonresidents outside of the jurisdiction of the court may be sufficient in a suit brought to foreclose a lien upon land within the State but it was also held that five days notice to a nonresident defendant where four days of constant traveling was necessary to reach the court was insufficient Mr Justice Brown in delivering the opinion of the court stated the question in dispute to be  whether a notice served upon the plaintiff in Rockingham county 1900 63

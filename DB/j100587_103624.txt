FOR THE APPLYING IT TO USE THE INSTRUMENT CONSISTS OF A METALLINE SPECULUM ABOUT SIX INCHES IN DIAMETER THE RADIUS OF THE SPHERE ON WHICH ITS CONCAVE SURFACE WAS GROUND IS TEN FEET FIVE INCHES AND ONE QUARTER AND CONSEQUENT LY ITS FOCAL LENGTH IS 62 58 INCHES THE BACK HAS A HOLLOW SCREW MADE AT ITS CENTRE TO RECEIVE THE END OF A HANDLE WHICH IS SCREWD ON WHENEVER THE METAL IS TO BE MOVED IN ORDER TO AVOID SULLYING ITS POLISHD SUR FACE BY HANDLING THIS OBJECTMETAL A PL II FIG 1 IS PLACED IN ONE END OF AN OCTANGULAR TUBE B B ABOUT SIX FEET LONG AND SOMETHING WIDER THAN WHAT IS SUFFICIENT TO RECEIVE THE METAL DYED BLACK ON THE INSIDE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN INCHES IN LENGTH OF THE THREE UPPERMOST SIDES OF THE TUBE C TOWARD THAT END AT WHICH THE METAL IS PLACD ARE SEPARATED FROM THE REST AND OPEN WITH TWO HINGES TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE METAL TO BE PUT IN AND TAKEN OUT THE END OF THE TUBE IS CLOSED BY AN OCTANGULAR PIECE OF BOARD D WHICH HAS AN OPENING D ABOUT 23 OF AN INCH BROAD FROM THE TOP DOWN TO A LITTLE BELOW THE CENTRE TO GIVE ROOM FOR THE BEFOREMENTIOND HANDLE WHEN THE OBJECTMETAL IS LIFTED INTO OR OUT OF THE TUBE AT OTHER TIMES IT IS CLOSED WITH A SLIDING SHUTTER THE B B B 2 METAL304 METAL IS PLACED SO AS TO HAVE ITS AXIS COINCIDE WITH THAT OF THE TUBE BY THE MEANS OF THREE SMALL BUTTONS FIXD TO THE INSIDE OF THE TUBE HAVING THEIR HINDER ENDS ALL IN THE SAME PLANE TO WHICH THIS AXIS IS PERPENDICU LAR TWO OF THESE APPEAR AT A A THE THIRD BEING AT THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TUBE IS NOT SEEN THE FORESIDE OF THE METAL RESTS AGAINST THESE BUTTONS IN THREE POINTS OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NEARLY EQUIDISTANT FROM EACH OTHER AND IS HELD TO THEM BY THREE SCREWS ONE OF WHICH APPEARS AT B WHICH RUN THROUGH THE OCTAN GULAR BOARD AT THE END OF THE TUBE AND BEAR AGAINST THE BACK OF THE METAL IN THREE POINTS WHICH DIRECTLY ANSWER THOSE THREE ON THE FORESIDE WITH JUST SO MUCH FORCE AS IS REQUISITE TO KEEP IT STEADY IN ITS PLACE THEY MUST NOT BE SCREWD HARDER AGAINST THE METAL FOR FEAR OF BENDING IT WHICH THO IT IS HALF AN INCH IN THICK NESS A VERY LITTLE FORCE IS SUFFICIENT TO DO WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS NOT USED THESE SCREWS ARE LOOFEND AND THE OBJECTMETAL IS TAKEN OUT AND LAID BY TO PREVENT ITS TARNISHING THE OVAL PLANE IS COMPOSD OF A PLATE OF THE SAME METAL WITH THE GREAT SPECULUM ABOUT 115 OR 116 OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS FOLDERD ON THE BACK TO ANOTHER OF BRASS ITS BREADTH IS SOMETHING LESS THAN HALF AN INCH AND IS IN PROPORTION TO ITS LENGTH AS 1 TO  2 AT ONE END OF THE OVAL THE BRASS PLATE PROJECTS A LITTLE BE YOND THE OTHER AND HAS A SCREW CUT THROUGH IT IN THAT PART AS LIKEWISE ANOTHER DIRECTLY AGAINST THE CENTRE OF THE FORESIDE THE OTHER END IS CYPHERD AWAY ON THE BACKSIDE THAT IT MAY INTERCEPT AS FEW OF THE RAYS IN THEIR PASSAGE TOWARDS THE OBJECTMETAL AS IS POSSIBLE THE TWO SCREWHOLES IN THE BACK SERVE TO FIX THIS OVAL A FIG 2 TO A BRASS ARM B WHICH IS FASTENED AT THE OTHER END INTO A SLIDER EE FIG 1 AND 2 THIS SLIDER305 SLIDER IS OF AN EQUAL THICKNESS WITH THE SIDE OF THE INFERREDTUBEINFERRED AND HAS A GROOVE G G FIG 1 CUT FOR IT IN THAT SIDE PARALLEL TO THE AXIS AND LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE ROOM FOR ITS MOTION TO SET THE TWO SPECULA AT THE DIFFE RENT DISTANCES WHICH THE SEVERAL EYEGLASSES REQUIRE IT RESTS ON THE INSIDE AGAINST TWO THIN LEDGES FASTENED WITHIN THE TUBE ALONG THE SIDES OF THE GROOVE ON THE OUTSIDE IT IS KEPT IN ITS PLACE BY A SLIDING SHUTTER NOT EXPRESSED IN THE FIGURE IN THE MIDDLE IT HAS A CYLINDRICK CAVITY D FIG 2 WHOSE AXIS IS EXACTLY PERPENDICULAR TO ITS INNER AND OUTER SURFACES EACH OF THE BOXES IN WHICH THE EYEGLASSES ARE CONTAINED IS FITTED TO THIS CAVITY THE BEFORMENTIOND BRASS ARM IS FIXD INTO THE INSIDE OF THIS SLIDER TOWARDS THE END FARTHEST FROM THE OBJECTMETAL IT RISES PERPENDICULAR FOR ABOUT TWO INCHES AND IS MADE FLAT SO AS TO TURN ONE EDGE TO THE RAYS WHICH COME FROM THE OBJECT ABOUT B IT IS BENT FORWARDS AND FLATTED THE OTHER WAY SO THAT WHEN THE BACK OF THE OVAL PLANE IS HELD FLAT TO IT BY THE TWO SCREWS C C THE AXIS OF THE CYLINDRICK CAVITY MAY FALL ON THE CENTRE OF ITS FORESIDE INCLIND TO ITS SURFACE IN AN ANGLE OF SOMETHING LESS THAN FOURTY FIVE DEGREES THIS ANGLE IS BROUGHT TO BE EXACT BY TWO VERY SMALL SCREWS I I WHOSE THREADS TAKE HOLD IN THE FLATTED END OF THE BRASS ARM AND THEIR POINTS BEARING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE OVAL RAISE ONE END OF IT A LITTLE FROM THE FLAT OF THE ARM THE SPECULA ARE SET AT THEIR DUE DISTANCE BY TURNING OF A LONG SCREW C C FOR WHICH THERE IS A NUT LODGED IN THE SLIDER AT G THE SCREW IS KEPT FROM MOVING BACKWARD OR FORWARD WHEN TIS TURNED BY A BRASS PLATE F WHICH IS TO BE FIXD TO THE FLAT END OF THE SIDE OF THE TUBE AND TAKEN OFF AT PLEASURE EACH OF THE EYEGLASS BOXES H HAS A SCREW ON THE OUTWARD END TO FASTEN TO IT A BOWL OR DISH306 DISH I TO RECEIVE THE BALL OF THE EYE AND GUARD IT FROM EXTERNAL LIGHT ON THE TOP OF THE TUBE IS FIXD ON TWO SMALL PEDE STALS A COMMON DIOPTRICK TELESCOPE H FIG 1 ABOUT EIGHTEEEN INCHES LONG ITS AXIS PARALLEL TO THAT OF THE TUBE AND HAVING TWO HAIRS PLACD IN THE COMMON FOCUS OF ITS OBJECT AND EYEGLASSES CROSSING ONE AN OTHER IN ITS AXIS THERE ARE THREE CONVEX EYEGLASSES BELONGING TO THE INSTRUMENT THE FIRST OR SHALLOWEST HAS ITS FOCAL DI STANCE OF ABOUT 13 OF AN INCH THE SECOND OF 310 AND THE DEEPEST OF 1140 OR SOMETHING LESS WHEN THE FIRST OF THESE IS USED WITH THE INSTRUMENT IT MAGNIFIES ABOUT 188 OR 190 TIMES IN DIAMETER WITH THE SECOND ABOUT 208 AND WITH THE THIRD 228 OR 230 EACH OF THESE GLASSES HAS PLACED IN THAT FOCUS NEAREST THE OVAL A CIRCLE TO DETERMINE THE PART OF THE OBJECT SEEN AT ONE VIEW AND IN THE OTHER FOCUS TOWARD THE EYE A BRASS PLATE WITH A LITTLE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE TO LET NO LIGHT PASS TO THE EYE FROM THE INSIDE OF THE TUBE BUT WHAT COMES FROM THE OVAL BESIDES THESE THREE CONVEX THERE ARE TWO CONCAVE EYEGLASSES WITH WHICH IT MAGNIFIES ABOUT 200 AND 220 TIMES AND ALSO A SETT OF THREE CONVEX WHICH TURN IT INTO A DAY TELESCOPE MAGNI FYING ABOUT 125 TIMES THE APERTURE IS LIMITED BY A CIRCLE OF CARD OR PASTBOARD PLACED BEFORE THE OB JECTMETAL IN THE TUBE TO VARY THE APERTURE THERE ARE THREE OF THESE CIRCLES AND THE APERTURES ALLOWED BY THEM ARE FIVE INCHES AND AN HALF FIVE INCHES AND FOUR AND AN HALF THO FOR SOME OBJECTS THE WHOLE ME TAL MAY BE LEFT OPEN THE ENGINE MADE USE OF TO DIRECT THE TUBE TO ANY OBJECT CONSISTS OF A STRONG PLANK F F FIG 1 AND 3 ABOUT FOURTEEN INCHES WIDE AND TWO FEET AND AN HALF OR THREE FEET LONG WHICH SERVES AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE307 THE WHOLE NEAR ONE END OF THIS PLANK IS PLACED AN UPRIGHT FOURSIDED BOX III FIG 1 AND 3 ABOUT TWO FEET HIGH NARROWER AT THE BACK NEXT THE END OF THE PLANK THAN BEFORE ITS TWO SIDES ARE MORTISED BOTH IN TO THE PLANK BELOW A A FIG3 AND INTO THE TOP OF THE BOX ABOVE D D THE BACK AND FORE PART ARE FASTEND TO THE EDGES OF THE SIDES WITH WOODSCREWS THE TOP HAS A CIRCULAR HOLE CUT IN IT SOMETHING ABOVE THREE INCHES IN DIAMETER WHOSE CENTRE IS ABOUT THREE INCHES DISTANT FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BACK AND AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM THE TWO SIDES THIS HOLE GIVES PASSAGE TO A TURNING PILLAR B IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH THERE IS FIXD AN IRON PIVOT C TO TURN IN A THICK BRASS PLATE LODGED IN THE PLANK B THE UPPER END OF THE PILLAR RISES ABOUT AN INCH AND AN HALF ABOVE THE TOP OF THE BOX AND IS MORTISED INTO A STRONG HEAD K FIG 1 AND 3 ABOUT EIGHT INCHES IN LENGTH AND FOUR OR FIVE IN BREADTH AND THICKNESS THIS HEAD CARRIES TWO CHEEKS L L ABOUT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN INCHES IN HEIGHT THEIR HINDER EDGES TOWARDS THE LOWER END EXTENDING FIVE IN CHES BEYOND THE AXIS OF THE PILLAR BACKWARD ALONG THE BACK OF THESE CHEEKS AT EQUAL DISTANCES ABOVE ONE ANOTHER THERE ARE NOTCHES TENDING OBLIQUELY DOWN WARDS AND ANSWERING ONE ANOTHER IN EACH CHEEK TO RECEIVE THE PIVOTS OF A CROOKED IRON AXIS C FIG3 ON WHICH THE TUBE IS PLACD THE NOTCHES ARE MADE AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS TO KEEP THE EYEGLASS AT A PROPER HEIGHT FOR THE EYE IN DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS OF THE OB JECT ABOVE THE HORIZON THE FIGURE OF THE AXIS AN SWERS THAT OF THE THREE UNDER SIDES OF THE TUBE THE AXIS OF THE TUBE LIES ABOUT TWO INCHES AND AN HALF HIGHER THAN THE AXIS OF THE MOTION UPON THESE PIVOTS AND THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY WHEN THE OBJECTMETAL IS IN IS ABOUT THREE INCHES BACKWARDER TO KEEP THE TUBE FROM SLIPPING BACK WHEN ITS FORE END IS RAISED IT HAS TWO308 TWO BUTTONS FIXED TO IT WHICH REST AGAINST THE FORE PART OF THE AXIS TO KEEP THE PILLAR FROM TOUCHING ANY OF THE SIDES OF THE ROUND HOLE IN WHICH IT TURNS A CYLINDRICK SECTOR CONTAINING ABOUT 65 OR 70 AND ABOUT AN INCH IN HEIGHT IS CUT OUT ON THE BACK PART OF THE PILLAR NEAR THE UPPER END D IN THE SQUARE ANGLE OF THIS CAVITY IS FIXD A THIN STEEL PLATE O O BENT CROSS THE MIDDLE TO THE SAME ANGLE THE INTERNAL ANGULAR EDGE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTS OF THIS PLATE LIES IN THE AXIS OF THE PIL LAR AND TURNS UPON THE HARDEND EDGE OF A WEDGELIKE IRON F WHOSE BASE OR BOARD PART IS FASTEND WITH TWO STRONG SCREWS ON THE TOP OF THE BOX DIRECTLY BEHIND THE ROUND HOLE BEFOREMENTIOND THE UPPER PARTS OF THE CHEEKS ARE STRENGTHENED BY TWO BRACKETS G G LEAVING ROOM BETWEEN THEM FOR THE BOTTOM OF THE TUBE TO TOUCH THE UPPER EDGE OF THE FORE PART OF THE HEAD THE HINDER PART OF THE HEAD IS ALSO HOLLOWD IN THE MANNER REPRESENTED IN THE THIRD FIGURE THE HEAD ON ITS FORE PART CARRIES A FLAT ARM M FIG 1 ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN INCHES LONG A LITTLE TAPER TOWARDS THE FARTHER END WHERE IT IS FOUR INCHES BROAD THIS IS STRENGTHENED BY A NARROW SLIP GLEWD EDGE WISE ALONG THE MIDDLE UNDERNEATH OAND ALSO BY A BRACE OR STAY N REACHING FROM THE TURNING PILLAR TO WITHIN NINE INCHES OF THE END OF THE ARM THE STAY PASSES THROUGH A TRANSVERSE OPENING CUT IN THE FORE PART OF THE BOX P WHICH IS LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW ROOM FOR A SUF FICIENT MOTION OF THE PILLAR ROUND ITS AXIS ON THE OTHER END OF THE BOTTOM PLANK TRANSVERSELY TO ITS LENGTH IS ERECTED A BOARD ABOUT TWELVE INCHES WIDE AND TWENTY SIX OR TWENTY SEVEN HIGH Q THE TOP OF IT REACHING WITHIN AN INCH AND AN HALF OF THE UNDER SIDE OF THE ARM THIS BOARD IS HELD FIRM IN ITS  POSITION309 POSITION BY A SPUR R PART OF ITS UPPER END ON THE OUTSIDE IS PARED OFF TOWARD THE EDGES TO FORM IT INTO THE SEGMENT OF A CYLINDER WHOSE AXIS COINCIDES WITH THAT OF THE PILLAR ITS USE IS TO SUPPORT A REST SS ON WHICH THE END OF THE FLAT ARM MOVES BACKWARD AND FORWARD THIS REST BEING APPLYD TRANSVERSELY TO THE OUTER PART OF THE UPRIGHT BOARD WHERE IT IS MADE CY LINDRICK IS BENT INTO THE SAME FIGURE BY THE MEANS OF FOUR SCREWPINS TWO OF WHICH PASSING THROUGH EACH END OF THIS AND OF ANOTHER PIECE OF THE SAME LENGTH T BUT SOMETHING NARROWER PLACED OVER AGAINST IT ON THE INSIDE OF THE BOARD BY THEIR NUTS DRAW THEM TOGETHER SO AS TO GRASP THE END OF THE UPRIGHT BOARD BETWEEN THEM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE REST BEING FIRST SHOT WITH A PLANE VERY STRAIT AND SMOOTH TO RENDER THE MO TION OF THE ARM ALONG THE REST SMOOTH AND EASY IT HAS TWO ROLLERS LODGED IN A BOX FIXD NEAR TO THE END ON ITS UNDERSIDE V TO ROLL UPON THE EDGE OF THE REST WHEN THE END OF THE ARM IS MOVED ALONG IT ONE OF THE ROLLERS IS PLACED NEAR EACH EDGE OF THE ARM AND THEIR AXES LYE IN LINES PASSING THROUGH THE AXIS OF THE TURNING PILLAR THE REST IS KEPT UP TO THEM WITH A PROPER DEGREE OF FORCE BY TWO SCREWS W W WHICH RUN IN TWO PLUGS XX FASTENED ON THE SIDES OF THE UP RIGHT BOARD AND BEAR AGAINST THE UNDER SIDES OF TWO PIECES FIXD ON THE INSIDE OF THE REST THE MOTION OF THE TUBE IS GOVERNED BY TWO BRASS PEGS Y AND Z THE FIRST OF THESE Y IS PLACD ABOUT 10 OR 11 INCHES FROM THE END OF THE ARM AND HAS A LINE WOUND ROUND IT WHICH PASSING UNDER A SMALL PUL LEY F FIXD IN A VERTICAL POSITION NEAR THE END OF THE ARM IS FASTENED TO A STAPLE ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE TUBE G THIS LINE BY THE TURNING OF THE PEG BRINGS THE FORE END OF THE TUBE TO ITS DUE ELEVATION BEING ACTED AGAINST BY THE EXCESS OF WEIGHT IN THE HINDER END C C C OF310 OF THE TUBE WHEN THE METAL IS IN IT WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT TWO POUND AT G WHERE THE LINE IS FASTENED IN GREAT ELEVATIONS OF THE OBJECT ABOVE THE HORIZON THE LINE IS NOT CARRIED SO FAR AS THE POINT G BUT IS FASTEND A LITTLE ABOVE THE PULLEY TO A LIGHT SQUARE STICK H HAVING AT ONE END A HOOK BY WHICH IT TAKES HOLD OF THE STAPLE G THIS IS DONE THAT THE SPRINGYNESS OF THE LINE MAY NOT CONTINUE A VIBRATING MOTION IN THE TUBE WHEN ANY THING HAPPENS TO SHAKE THE INSTRUMENT AND MAKE THE OBJECT APPEAR TO TREMBLE THE LOWER PART OF THE STICK RESTS AGAINST THE END OF THE ARM AND BY ITS SLIGHT FRICTION CONTRIBUTES TO THE SAME EFFECT THE OTHER PEG Z IS SO PLACD THAT IT MAY BE CON VENIENTLY REACHED BY ONE HAND OF THE OBSERVER WHILE THE OTHER IS EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PEG Y IT REGULATES THE HORIZONTAL MOTION OF THE TUBE BY MEANS OF A LINE WHICH BEING WOUND ABOUT THE PEG AT ONE END PASSES BY ANOTHER SMALL PULLEY PLACED CLOSE BY THE SIDE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED ONE IN AN HORIZONTAL POSTURE NOT TO BE SEEN IN THE FIGURE AND IS HUNG ON A PIN DRIVEN INTO THE LITTLE HEAD K IT IS ACTED AGAINST BY TWO SPRINGS M AND N FIG 3 PLACED IN THE BOX III ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE TURNING PILLAR THAT ON THE RIGHT HAND M DRAWS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PILLAR FORWARD BY A VERY STRONG LINE WHICH BEING FASTENED TO THE HEAD OF THE SPRING PASSES ROUND THE BACK PART OF THE PILLAR TO A PIN AT P BY WHICH IT IS STRAIND TO ITS DUE STRENGTH THE SPRING ON THE LEFT HAND N DRAWS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PILLAR BACKWARDS IN THE SAME MANNER THESE PINS ARE PLACD ON THE PILLAR A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE TOPS OF THE SPRINGS THAT BEING DRAWN A LITTLE DOWNWARDS AS WELL AS TURND ROUND ITS AXIS THE PIVOT IN ITS BOTTOM MAY NOT BE RAISED OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BRASS PLATE WHEN THE REST BEARS HARD AGAINST THE ROLLERS AT THE END OF THE ARM EACH OF THESE SPRINGS DRAWS WITH A FORCE EQUAL TO ABOUT 18311 18 OR 20 POUNDS WEIGHT WHEN THE END OF THE ARM IS CARRIED CLOSE TO THE SMALL HEAD K FIG 1 AND CONSE QUENTLY THE SEMIDIAMETER OF THE PILLAR BEING AN INCH AND HALF AND THE DISTANCE OF THAT HEAD FROM THE AXIS ABOUT 28 OR 29 INCHES THE END OF THE ARM WILL BE CAR RIED BY THE UNITED FORCES OF BOTH THE SPRINGS TOWARDS THE OTHER END OF THE REST WITH A FORCE EQUIVALENT TO THE WEIGHT OF ABOUT TWO POUNDS EACH OF THE PEGS Y AND Z TURNS IN A HOLE MADE IN A PIECE OF WOOD L FASTNED TO THE UNDER SIDE OF THE ARM AND THE PIECES BEING SLIT WITH A SAW FROM ONE END THROUGH THE HOLE AND ABOUT HALF AN INCH BEYOND IT THE SEPARATED PARTS ARE DRAWN TO GETHER BY A SKREW M TILL THE END OF THE PEG IS GRIPED BETWEEN THEM WITH A DUE DEGREE OF FORCE BY THESE PEGS WITH THE HELP OF THE TELESCOPE H THE TUBE IS EASILY DIRECTED TO ANY OBJECT AND MADE TO ACCOMPANY A CELESTIAL ONE IN ITS DIURNAL MOTION WHILE THE END OF THE ARM MOVES THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE REST IF IT BE DESIRED THAT WHEN THE OBJECT IS FOUND THE TURNING OF ONE PEG SHOULD CARRY THE TUBE ALONG WITH THE MOTION OF THE HEAVENS SO AS TO KEEP THE OBJECT AL WAYS IN SIGHT THIS MAY EASILY BE EFFECTED IN VARIOUS MANNERS THE CONCAVE SURFACE OF THE OBJECTMETAL HAS MANY LITTLE SPOTS IN IT WHICH COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO TAKE A POLISH IN ONE OR TWO PLACES THE METAL ITSELF SEEMS TO HAVE SOME SMALL PARTS SOMETHING HARDER OR SOFTER THAN THE REST OCCASIONING AN IRREGULARITY IN THE FIGURE OF THE METAL ABOUT THEM BUT THESE PARTS BEING SMALL IN PROPORTION TO THE WHOLE DO NOT SEEM CONSI DERABLY TO AFFECT THE DISTINCTNESS OF THE APPEARANCE THE OPEN AIR HAS COMMONLY AN UNDULATING MOTION IN ITS PARTS ESPECIALLY IN THE DAY TIME WHICH OCCASIONS THE RAYS OF LIGHT TO DEFLECT A LITTLE FROM THE STRAIT LINES IN WHICH THEY OUGHT TO MOVE IN ORDER TO RENDER THE C C C 2 SPECIES312 SPECIES PERFECTLY DISTINCT THE EFFECT OF THIS THOUGH INSENSIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE OR EVEN THROUGH A SMALL TELESCOPE BECOMES CONSIDERABLE WHEN THE OBJECT IS VERY MUCH MAGNIFIED THE INSTRUMENT WHEN TRYD AT AN OBJECT ENCLOSED SO AS TO SECURE IT FROM THIS INCONVE NIENCE SEEMS TO BEAR AN APERTURE OF FIVE INCHES AND AN HALF WITH THE DEEPEST OF THE FOREMENTIONED EYEGLASSES AS WELL AS THE COMMON TELESCOPES DO THE USUAL CHARGE AND APERTURE GIVEN TO THEM EXCEPT THAT IN THESE THE OBJECTS APPEAR A LITTLE BRIGHTER FIG 1 REPRESENTS THE INSTRUMENT PLACED ON THE MA CHINE IN ORDER TO BE APPLYD TO USE FIG 2 REPRESENTS THE INSIDE OF THE SLIDER WITH THE REST OF THE APPARATUS BELONGING TO THE OVAL PLANE AND EYEGLASS FIG 3 REPRESENTS THE HINDER PART OF THE MACHINE THE BACK AND ONE SIDE OF THE BOX BEING TAKEN AWAY TO SHEW THE TURNING PILLAR AND SPRINGS ON THE INFIDE FIG 4 REPRESENTS SATURN AS IT APPEARD IN JUNE 1720 BY THIS TELESCOPE IX ANATOMIA

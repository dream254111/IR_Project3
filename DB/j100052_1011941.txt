AGREEMENTS AND AFFILIATIONS IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRADE BY S S HUEBNER PHD PROFESSOR OF INSURANCE AND COMMERCE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND EX PERT TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE MERCHANT MARINE AND FISHERIES DURING ITS INVESTIGATION OF SHIPPING COMBINATIONS THE RECENT INVESTIGATION OF SHIPPING COMBINATIONS BY THE COM MITTEE ON THE MERCHANT MARINE AND FISHERIES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRE SENTATIVES SHOWED THAT AS REGARDS NEARLY EVERY TRADE ROUTE IN BOTH THE FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES PRACTICALLY ALL THE WELLESTABLISHED STEAMSHIP LINES HAVE EITHER BEEN CONSOLIDATED THROUGH STOCK OWNERSHIP OR WORK IN HARMONIOUS CO6PERATION THROUGH WRITTEN OR ORAL AGREEMENTS AND CONFERENCE ARRANGEMENTS CONSIDER ABLY OVER 100 SUCH AGREEMENTS AND CONSOLIDATIONS AFFECTING THE COM MERCE OF THIS COUNTRY WERE FOUND TO EXIST NO ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO DISCUSS THESE AGREEMENTS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THEIR HISTORICAL DE VELOPMENT THEIR ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES AND THEIR ADMINIS TRATION AND ENFORCEMENT SINCE THESE SUBJECTS ARE COVERED BY OTHER ARTICLES IN THIS VOLUME INSTEAD THE PURPOSE IS TO OUTLINE THE VARIOUS AGREEMENTS UNDERSTANDINGS AND OTHER AFFILIATIONS AS THEY EXISTED WHEN THE COMMITTEE ON THE MERCHANT MARINE AND FISHERIES CONCLUDED ITS INVESTIGATION IN 1913 AND TO PRESENT IN CONNECTION THEREWITH AS FAR AS THE LIMITS OF AN ARTICLE PERMIT 1 A BRIEF DESCRIP TION OF THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF EXISTING CODPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND 2 A STATEMENT OF THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH MAY BE DRAWN FROM A STUDY OF ALL THE AGREEMENTS AND AFFILIATIONS CONSIDERED COLLECTIVELY AGREEMENTS AND CONFERENCES IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN TRADE IN VIEW OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AND CONFERENCE ARRANGEMENTS80 BEING DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT PREPARED FOR THE COMMITTEE ON THE MERCHANT MARINE AND FISHERIESLONLY A BRIEF DE 1 REPORT ON STEAMSHIP AGREEMENTS AND AFFILIATIONS IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRADE PREPARED BY S S HUEBNER AND PUBLISHED AS VOLUME IV OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE MERCHANT MARINE AND FISHERIES IN THE INVESTIGATION OF SHIPPING COMBINATIONS UNDER H RES 587 FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE NUMEROUS STEAMSHIP AGREEMENTS AND CONFERENCE ARRANGE 7576 THE ANNALS OF THE AMBRICAN ACADBMT SCRIPTION OF THE SAME CAN BE ATTEMPTED IN AN ARTICLE A COMPREHEN SIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF THESE NUMEROUS AGREEMENTS CAN BE BEST OBTAINED BY CONSIDERING THE SAME AS THEY EXIST IN THE FOLLOWING SIX GEOGRAPHIC DIVISIONS OF THIS COUNTRYS FOREIGN TRADE THIS METHOD HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF SHOWING HOW UNIVERSALLY THE NUMEROUS GROUPS OF REGULAR STEAMSHIP LINES ARE GOVERNED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE SPHERES BY COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WHICH HAVE FOR THEIR FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE THE CONTROL OF 1 COMPETITION BETWEEN THE SIGNATORY LINES AND 2 COM PETITION FROM NONCONFERENCE LINES WHICH MAY BE SEEKING TO SHARE THE TRADE THE NORTH ATLANTIC TRADE COVERING ALL PORTS OF EUROPEPRACTICALLY ALL THE WELLESTABLISHED LINES CONNECTING NORTH ATLANTIC PORTS OF THE UNITED STATES WITH THOSE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM NORTH EUROPE AND THE MEDITERRANEAN ARE PARTIES TO NUMEROUS FREIGHT AGREEMENTS COVERING IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER NEARLY EVERY SPHERE OF THE AMERICANEUROPEAN TRADE IN FACT OVER 40 REGULAR TRANSATLANTIC LINES ARE PARTIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE EUROPEAN TRADES TO AT LEAST 20 AGREEMENTS INVOLVING THE FREIGHT TRAFFIC

WESTBOUND TRAFFIC FROM GERMAN DUTCH BELGIAN AND FRENCH PORTS TO THE UNITED STATES IS REGULATED BY A NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE HAMBURGAMERICAN NORTH GERMAN LLOYD HOLLAND AMERICA AND RED STAR LINES ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE N D L V WESTBOUND FREIGHT AGREEMENT AS FAR BACK AS 1894 THIS AGREEMENT COMPRISED THE ENTIRE TRAFFIC OF THESE LINES FROM PORTS OF THE NORTH GERMAN SEACOAST HOLLAND AND BELGIUM TO PORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND HAD FOR ITS PURPOSE THE BRINGING ABOUT OF A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING REGARDING FREIGHT RATES TO BE MAINTAINED ON A CORRESPONDING BASIS AND TO PRESERVE TO EACH SEPARATE COMPANY ITS SHARE OF THE TOTAL INCOME FROM THE FREIGHT TRAFFIC ALTHOUGH MOD IFIED IN ITS ORIGINAL DETAILS THIS AGREEMENT IS OBSERVED BY THE LINES AT PRESENT THE N D L V ALSO EFFECTED AGREEMENTS 1 WITH THE COMPAGNIE GNDRALE TRANSATLANTIQUE WHEREBY THE PORT OF HAVRE IS RESERVED TO THE FRENCH LINE FOR BOTH FREIGHT AND PASSENGER BUSINESS BY DIRECT LINE TO AND FROM THE UNITED STATES THIS LINE IN TURN AGREEING NOT TO CALL AT ANY PORT BETWEEN CRONSTADT AND THE FRENCH FRONTIER EITHER FOR FREIGHT OR PASSENGER BUSINESS EXCEPT WITH THE CONSENT OF THE N D L V AND 2 WITH THE AUSTROAMERICANA WHEREBY THIS LINE AGREES NOT TO ESTABLISH ANY FREIGHT OR PASSENGER SERV ICE BETWEEN BORDEAUX OR PORTS NORTH OF BORDEAUX AND THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA THE N D L V LINES IN TURN DECLARING THEIR INTENTION NOT TO ESTABLISH LINES FROM THE ADRIATIC TO NORTH AMERICA FROM ANTWERP THE ONLY TWO IMPORTANT LINES OPERATING TO THE UNITED STATES ARE THE RED STAR LINE WITH SERVICES TO NEW YORK BOSTON PHIL ADELPHIA AND BALTIMORE AND THE LEYLAND LINE TO NEW ORLEANS BOTH BEING SUBSIDIARIES OF THE INTERNATIONAL MERCANTILE MARINE CO MINOR OUTSIDE LINES IT IS REPORTED ARE ABLE TO OPERATE THEIR SERVICES ONLY BY REASON OF DIFFERENTIAL RATE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE OTHER LINES THE REGULAR LINES OPERATING BETWEEN ROTTERDAM AND THE UNITED STATES ARE THE HOLLANDAMERICA RUSSIAN EAST ASIATIC AND URANIUM LINES WHILE78 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE LAST LINE IS IN OPEN COMPETITION WITH THE OTHERS THE FIRST TWO HAVE EFFECTED A TRAFFIC AGREEMENT WHEREBY THE RUSSIAN EAST ASIATIC LINE DECLARES ITS INTENTION TO OPERATE ONLY TO RUSSIAN PORTS AND THAT IF IT FINDS IT NECESSARY TO CALL FOR FREIGHT AT ROTTERDAM WHEN OTHER CARGO IS LACKING IT AGREES TO MAINTAIN THE RATES OF THE HOLLANDAMERICA LINE UNLIKE THE PRACTICE PREVAILING AMONG THE LINES OPERATING TO THE PORTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM IT APPEARS THAT THE CONTINENTAL LINES HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO CONFERENCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MINIMUM RATES IN THE EASTBOUND TRAFFIC REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE HOWEVER TO THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE HAMBURGAMERICAN LINE AND THE NORTH GERMAN LLOYD WHEREBY THESE LINES RESERVE TO EACH OTHER RE SPECTIVELY THE PORTS OF HAMBURG AND BREMEN AS REGARDS SAILINGS FROM ALL AMERICAN PORTS NORTH OF SAVANNAH ALL THE LINES IN THE TRADE BETWEEN NORTH ATLANTIC PORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND PORTS ON THE BALTICHAMBURGAMERICAN NORTH GERMAN LLOYD WILSON AND UNITED STEAMSHIP LINESARE PARTIES TO POOLING AGREEMENTS COVERING BOTH THE EASTBOUND AND WESTBOUND TRAFFIC IN THE EASTBOUND TRADE FOUR SEPARATE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS EXIST ONE PERTAINING TO FLOUR SHIPMENTS FROM BOSTON NEW YORK PHIL ADELPHIA BALTIMORE AND NEWPORT NEWS TO RUSSIAN AND GERMAN PORTS ON THE BALTIC AS WELL AS TO PORTS OF DENMARK NORWAY AND SWEDEN ONE TO EIGHTEEN LEADING COMMODITIES COMING UNDER THE HEAD OF PRO VISIONS FROM AND TO THE SAME PORTS ONE TO SHIPMENTS OF CERTAIN ARTICLES CLASSED AS AGRICULTURES AND THE LAST TO EIGHTEEN OTHER IM PORTANT ARTICLES OF EXPORT COMPRISING FEEDSTUFFS HEAVY GRAIN PRODUCTS OIL CAKE ETC IN THE WESTBOUND BUSINESS THE LINES ALSO OPERATE UNDER A POOLING AGREEMENT SIMILAR IN CHARACTER TO THAT ADOPTED IN THE EAST BOUND TRAFFIC ALL THE LINES SEEK TO CHARGE THE SAME RATES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS EXCEPT WHERE THEY CANNOT MAINTAIN THEIR ALLOTTED PERCENT AGES IN WHICH CASE IT IS EXPECTED THAT THEY WILL PURSUE A POLICY OF FORCING THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC BY ADJUSTING RATES UNTIL THE FULL PERCENTAGES ARE SECURED TURNING NOW TO A CONSIDERATION OF THE TRAFFIC TO AND FROM MEDITER RANEAN PORTS WE FIND THAT PRACTICALLY ALL THE LINES ON NEARLY EVERY TRADE ROUTE CO6PERATE UNDER SOME FORM OF RATE OR TRAFFIC AGREEMENT REFERENCE WILL BE MADE HERE ONLY TO THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE AGREE MENTS VIZ

BE DUE TO SHIPPERS UNTIL AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AFTER THE PERIOD FOR WHICH THEY ARE COMPUTED AND THAT THE ALLOWANCE SHALL BE SACRIFICED BY ANY SHIPPER WHO IN THE MEANTIME SHALL HAVE SUPPORTED A COMPETING STEAMER IN THE EASTBOUND TRADE THE LINES WERE REPORTED TO THE COMMITTEE AS HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING AS TO MINIMUM RATES OF FREIGHT THIS UNDERSTANDING IS NOT IN WRITING BUT THE AGENTS OF THE LINES MEET AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS ON THE AMERICAN SIDE TO DETER MINE RATES WHICH WHEN ESTABLISHED ARE CHANGED ONLY BY COMMON CONSENT THE LIMITED SPACE AT OUR DISPOSAL WILL PERMIT MERELY A REFER ENCE TO AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE NORTH ATLANTIC PASSENGER TRAFFIC SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT AT THE TIME OF THE COMMITTEES INVESTIGATION ALL THE PROMINENT PASSENGER LINES WERE PARTIES TO AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE NORTH ATLANTIC PASSENGER TRAFFIC TO AND FROM BRITISH NORTH CONTI NENTAL AND MEDITERRANEAN PORTS TWENTYEIGHT LINES COMPRISING ALL THE LARGE ONES WERE FOUND TO BE AFFILIATED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE SPHERES

ADMINISTERING THE PROVISIONS OF THE EASTWARD WESTWARD AND POOLING AGREEMENTS VIZ THE NEW YORK CONFERENCE THE HONGKONG AND SINGAPORE CONFERENCES AND THE LONDON CONFERENCE EACH CONFERENCE HAS ITS OWN FUNCTIONS TO PERFORM THE NEW YORK AGENTS OF THE LINES MEET IN THE NEW YORK CONFERENCE AND CONTROL THE MAKING OF EASTBOUND RATES AND TARIFFS SIMILARLY THE EASTERN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LINES MEETING IN THE HONGKONG AND SINGAPORE CONFERENCES HAVE THE SAME JURISDICTION OVER THE WESTBOUND TRAFFIC AS THAT EXERCISED BY THE NEW YORK CONFERENCE IN REGARD TO THE EASTBOUND VOYAGE THE LONDON CONFERENCE IS COM POSED OF THE OWNERS OF THE SEVERAL LINES AND NOT ONLY EXERCISES GENERAL SUPERVISORY CONTROL OVER THE OTHER CONFERENCES BUT DETERMINES THE SCHEDULE OF SAILINGS TO BE ADHERED TO AND CONTROLS AND

TONNAGE MUST BE PRO VIDED EQUALLY BY THE TWO COMPANIES BUT IN THE OUTWARD SERVICE THE TWO LINES IN THE ORDER NAMED FURNISH THE TONNAGE IN THE RESPECTIVE PROPORTIONS OF 75 AND 25 PER CENT FREIGHT RATES ON THE OUTWARD VOY AGE ARE FIXED AND CHANGED BY THE AGENTS IN INDIA IN CONSULTATION WITH THE LONDON PRINCIPALS THE EARNINGS OF THE STEAMERS WESTBOUND ARE POOLED AND AFTER ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN PAYMENTS ARE EQUALLY DIVIDED TO JAVA THE DIRECT SERVICE IS CONDUCTED UNDER A JOINT ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE HANSA LINE AND THE GERMANAUSTRALIAN STEAMSHIP CO THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS EFFECTED BY THE HANSA LINE WITH THE GERMAN AUSTRALIAN LINE BECAUSE OF THE LATTERS EUROPEAN SERVICE TO JAVA AND THE FEAR THAT TROUBLE WOULD ENSUE IF AN AGREEMENT COULD NOT BE REACHED ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT THE SAILINGS ARE ALLOTTED IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER SIX STEAMERS ARE FURNISHED ANNUALLY BY THE HANSA LINE THEN THE OTHER LINE SUPPLIES SIX IN CASE THAT MANY ARE REQUIRED AND IF MORE THAN TWELVE STEAMERS

DEFERRED REBATES TO LOYAL SHIPPERS THE CHIEF REASON BEING IT IS SAID THAT SHIPMENTS AT HONGKONG ARE MADE LARGELY BY CHINESE FIRMS WHICH CANNOT BE WATCHED LIKE EXPORTERS FROM JAPAN WHO ARE REGISTERED

WITH THE HAMBURG LINES IN THEIR BRAZILEUROPE SERV ICE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PANAMERICAN MAIL LINE AND THE LLOYD BRAZILEIRO SHOWS THIS DEFERRED REBATE SYSTEM TO CONSTITUTE AN ALMOST INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO THE SUCCESSFUL ENTRANCE INTO THE TRADE OF ANY INDEPENDENT REGULAR LINE WHICH DOES NOT POSSESS POWERFUL FINANCIAL BACKING OR THE GOOD WILL OF THE CONFERENCE LINES THE FIRST OF THESE INDEPENDENT LINES FAILED AFTER ITS FIRST TRIP LARGELY BECAUSE OF ITS INABIL ITY TO OBTAIN RETURN CARGO WHILE THE LAST LINE HAS ALSO FAILED TO OBTAIN A FAIR PROPORTION OF THE EXISTING CARGO ON THE NORTHWARD RUN IN THIS CONNECTION AS STATED IN THE REPORT TO THE COMMITTEE  IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT NEARLY EVERY SHIPPER OF ANY IMPORTANCE IN BRAZIL HAS CONNECTIONS IN EUROPE AS WELL AS IN THE UNITED STATES THE EUROPEAN INTERESTS IN MANY INSTANCES BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THIS REASON NEITHER THE PANAMERICAN MAIL LINE NOR THE LLOYD BRAZILEIRO COULD RELIEVE THE SHIPPERS 5 REPORT ON STEAMSHIP AGREEMENTS AND AFFDIATIONS IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRADE PP 164 165STEAMSHIP LINE AGREEMENTS 89 FROM THEIR DEPENDENCE ON THE CONFERENCE LINES WHICH CONTROL BOTH THE AMERI CAN AND EUROPEAN SERVICE BY GUARANTEEING TO CARRY ALL THEIR CARGOES UNLESS THEY ALSO ESTABLISH A EUROPEAN SERVICE BUT EVEN ASSUMING THAT THE INDEPEND ENT LINE WOULD UNDERTAKE TO ESTABLISH A EUROPEAN SERVICE IT WOULD STILL BE GREAT LY HANDICAPPED 1 BY THE DIFFICULTY OF A SINGLE LINE GIVING ITS PATRONS SUFFICIENTLY FREQUENT AND REGULAR SAILINGS AS COMPARED WITH THE LARGE CONFERENCE LINES WHICH ALTERNATE THEIR SAILINGS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TRADE AND THUS CO6PERATIVELY ACCOMPLISH IN THE WAY OF FREQUENCY AND REGULARITY OF SERVICE WHAT NO ORDINARY SINGLE LINE CAN HOPE TO DO AND 2 BY THE INDUCEMENTS AFFORDED TO SHIPPERS TO REMAIN LOYAL TO THE OLD ESTABLISHED LINES BY THE 10 PER CENT DEFERRED REBATE SYSTEM PREVAILING IN BOTH THE AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN TRADES IN THE SOUTHBOUND TRADE FROM NEW YORK TO THE RIVER PLATE AN ORAL UNDERSTANDING HAS EXISTED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 1912 BETWEEN THE LAMPORT AND HOLT HOUSTON PRINCE BARBER AND AMERICAN AND RIO PLATA LINES FOR THE FIXING AND MAINTENANCE OF RATES AND THESE LINES ALSO SEEM JUDGING FROM THE TESTIMONY TO HAVE A TACIT UNDERSTANDING WITH THE BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE LINES TO RESPECT EACH OTHERS TERRITORY AT THEIR WEEKLY CONFERENCE MEETINGS FREIGHT RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED FIVE RIVER PLATE LINES BUT THE FREIGHT MONEY IS NOT POOLED AND BELONGS TO EACH LINE AS EARNED NOR IS THERE ANY LIMITATION UPON THE NUMBER OR SIZE OF THE STEAMERS THAT MAY BE PLACED IN THE TRADE BY ANY LINE OR UPON THE TIME WHEN STEAMERS MAY BE DISPATCHED THE NORTON LINE ANOTHER CARRIER IN THE TRADE WAS A MEMBER OF THE CONFER ENCE UNTIL ITS RECENT VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL BUT WHILE THIS LINE HAS NOW NO UNDERSTANDING WITH THE CONFERENCE LINES AND DOES NOT PARTICI PATE IN THE CONFERENCE MEETINGS THE CONFERENCE LINES KEEP IT POSTED AS TO RATES THE TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES SHOWS THAT THE NORTON LINE HAS MAINTAINED THE RATES OF THE OTHER LINES AND THAT ITS RELATIONS WITH THE FIVE CONFERENCE LINES ARE AS CORDIAL AS THEY WERE WHEN IT HELD MEM BERSHIP IN THE CONFERENCE IN THE NORTHBOUND TRADE FROM THE RIVER PLATE THE BARBER LAMPORT AND HOLT AND HOUSTON LINES OPERATE UNDER AN AGREEMENT WHICH CONTAINS A DEFERRED REBATE FEATURE RATES ARE MADE IN COMMON AND SHIPPERS ARE ALLOWED A 5 PER CENT REBATE IF THEY CONFINE THEIR SHIP MENTS TO THE COMBINATION LINES FOR A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS THIS RE BATE ALLOWANCE APPLIES ON ALL ARTICLES EXCEPT CEREALS AND LINSEED WHICH CONSTITUTE A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE TRAFFIC FROM THE RIVER PLATE TO THE UNITED STATES ALL THE LINES IN THE TRAFFIC FROM THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA VIA PANAMA ARE90 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WORKING UNDER A TACIT RATE UNDERSTANDING THE LINES ENGAGED IN THIS TRADE ARE 1 THE ROYAL MAIL STEAM PACKET CO THE HAMBURG AMERICAN LINE ATLAS SERVICE THE UNITED FRUIT CO AND THE PANAMA RAILROAD STEAMSHIP CO FROM NEW YORK VIA PANAMA 2 THE UNITED FRUIT CO FROM NEW ORLEANS VIA PANAMA AND 3 THE MUNSON LINE WITH SAILINGS FROM BALTIMORE TO COLON AND OCCASIONAL SAILINGS FROM NEW YORK ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT OF THE UNITED FRUIT CO THERE IS A VERBAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN IT AND THE OTHER LINES TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WILL DISCUSS WITH THEM PROPOSED CHANGES IN RATES BEFORE THE SAME BECOME EFFECTIVE WITH A VIEW TO MAINTAINING STABILITY IN RATES AND KEEPING EACH LINE ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGES BY THE OTHERS WHILE ALL THE LINES HAVE ADOPTED THE PANAMA RAILROAD COS TARIFF THE UNITED FRUIT CO EMPHASIZED THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO AGREEMENT TO MAINTAIN ANY RATE ESTABLISHED BY THE OTHERS AND EACH COMPANY MAKES AND PUBLISHES ITS OWN RATES AND IS FREE TO ADHERE TO THESE RATES OR NOT AS IT SEES FIT IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THE UNITED FRUIT CO OBSERVES THE SAME RATES IN ITS NEW ORLEANS TO COLON SERVICE AS ARE CHARGED BY THE NEW YORK LINES AND THAT THERE IS A TACIT UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE LINES THAT THE RATES FROM NEW ORLEANS SHALL BE THE SAME AS FROM NEW YORK THE MUNSON LINE ALSO REPORTED TO THE COMMITTEE THAT IT HAS A VERBAL UNDERSTAND ING WITH THE LINES RUNNING OUT OF NEW YORK TO COLON BY WHICH IT CONFINES ITS COLON SAILINGS FROM NORTH OF HATTERAS PORTS TO THE PORT OF BALTIMORE AND THAT WHILE THERE IS NO AGREEMENT AS TO MAKING OR MAINTAINING RATES OF FREIGHT THE LINE TRIES TO SECURE AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE OUT OF BALTIMORE THE SAME RATES AS ARE SECURED OUT OF NEW YORK MUCH THE SAME SITUATION PREVAILS IN THE NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC FROM THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA TO THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD OF THE UNITED STATES VIA PANAMA CLOSE BUSINESS RELATIONS EXIST BETWEEN THE THREE LINES OPERATING FROM THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA TO PANAMA AND ALL OF THE FOUR LINES ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE OF THE ISTHMUS ARE SAID TO RECEIVE THE SAME PROPORTION OF THE THROUGH RATE WHICH THE COMMITTEE WAS ADVISED IS APPROXIMATELY 30 PER CENT WITH REFERENCE TO THE TRAFFIC BETWEEN PACIFIC COAST PORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE WEST COAST OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICO THE PACIFIC MAIL STEAMSHIP CO IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT AND IS SAID TO HAVE NO TRAFFIC OR RATE AGREEMENT WITH ANY OF THE OTHER LINES IN THE TRADE BUT WHILE THE EXISTENCE OF ANY AGREEMENTS ORSTEAMSHIP LINE AGREEMENTS 91 UNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN THE LINES HAS BEEN DENIED BY THE STEAMSHIP INTERESTS INVOLVED THE FREIGHT TARIFFS OF THE SEVERAL LINES AS WELL AS THE STATEMENTS MADE TO THE COMMITTEE BY AMERICAN CONSULAR REPRE SENTATIVES AND CERTAIN IMPORTANT IMPORTING FIRMS AT SAN FRANCISCO INDICATE THAT THE PACIFIC MAIL IS THE DOMINANT POWER IN THE TRADE AND THAT THE OTHER LINES ADOPT ITS RATES AND REFRAIN FROM ANTAGONIZING ITS INTERESTS IN THE TRAFFIC BETWEEN NEW YORK AND THE WEST COAST OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICO IT APPEARS THAT ALL THE LINES TRANSHIP THEIR NEW YORK CARGO AT THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA BY THE PACIFIC MAIL FOR DISTRIBUTION TO CENTRAL AMERICAN AND MEXICAN PORTS ON THE PACIFIC THE ATLANTIC LINES ARE THE SAME AS THOSE PREVIOUSLY DIS CUSSED AND THE BUSINESS IS CONTROLLED BY THE SAME RATE UNDERSTANDING WHICH GOVERNS THEIR OPERATIONS IN THE TRADE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA THE CARIBBEAN TRADE COVERING THE WEST INDIES CENTRAL AMERICA AND MEXICOTHE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE HAMBURGAMERICAN LINE AND THE ROYAL MAIL STEAM PACKET CO AND THE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THESE LINES AND THE UNITED FRUIT CO WHICH WERE REFERRED TO IN CON NECTION WITH THE TRADE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND THE CARIBBEAN PORTS OF COLOMBIA ALSO GOVERN THESE LINES IN THEIR TRADE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND JAMAICA AND CENTRAL AMERICA IT NEED ONLY BE STATED THAT WITH REFERENCE TO JAMAICA THE HAMBURGAMERICAN AND ROYAL MAIL LINES BESIDES AGREEING UPON FREIGHT RATES ALLOW A DEFERRED REBATE OF 10 PER CENT ON SHIPMENTS FROM NEW YORK TO KINGSTON JAMAICA THIS DEFERRED REBATE ALLOWANCE HOWEVER DOES NOT APPLY ON SHIPMENTS FROM NEW YORK TO JAMAICAN OUTPORTS OR ON SHIPMENTS FROM JAMAICA TO NEW YORK THE COMMITTEE WAS ADVISED BY A PROMINENT SHIPPING FIRM THAT IT RECEIVED THE SAME REBATE ALLOWANCE OF 10 PER CENT FROM THE UNITED FRUIT CO ON SHIPMENTS FROM NEW YORK TO KINGSTON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LINES OPERATING ON THE NUMEROUS OTHER ROUTES WITHIN THIS GROUP MAY BE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS FOR THE PRINCIPAL TRADES 1 IN THE TRADE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND NORTH CUBAN PORTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HAVANA THE NEW YORK AND CUBA MAIL STEAM SHIP CO HAD UNTIL RECENTLY AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMPAFIIA MARITIMA CUBANA FOR A TERRITORIAL DIVISION OF DESTINATION PORTS THE LATTER LINE APPEARS TO SERVE EXCLUSIVELY THE NORTH CUBAN PORTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NIPE BAY WHICH

AGENT OF THE COMPAFIIA MARITIMA CUBANA HAVING TESTIFIED THAT THE ROYAL MAIL GOES SO FAR AS TO ASK US WHETHER OUR RATES ARE BEING MAINTAINED IN SOME CASES WHERE SHIPPERS HAVE CLAIMED THAT THEY HAVE HAD LOWER RATES THEY LEAD US TO INFER BY THESE QUESTIONS THAT THEY ARE MAINTAINING OUR RATES AND OUR REPLY LETS THEM KNOW WHETHER WE ARE MAINTAINING THE RATES UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1911 THE ATLAS SERVICE OF THE HAMBURG AMERICAN LINE CONDUCTED A SERVICE FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR TO HAVANA AND AT THE TIME ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF ITS FREIGHT TRAFFIC MANAGER HAD A TACIT BUT UNWRITTEN UNDERSTANDING AS TO FREIGHT RATES WITH THE NEW YORK AND CUBA MAIL LINE THE NEW YORK AND CUBA MAIL IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE GULF FOREIGN FREIGHT COM MITTEE CONSISTING OF THE FIVE LINES OPERATING FROM KEY WEST MOBILE NEW ORLEANS AND GALVESTON TO CUBAN PORTS AND VICE VERSA ACCORD ING TO ITS REPORT THE LINE ATTENDS THE MEETINGS OF THIS COMMITTEE VERY INFREQUENTLY AND ITS ONLY REASON FOR BELONGING TO THE SAME IS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AS TO THE FREIGHT RATES FROM THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO THE SEABOARD AND FROM THE GULF TO CUBAN PORTS IN ORDER TO ENABLE IT TO MEET THEIR COMPETITION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE AMERICAN AND CUBAN STEAMSHIP LINE WITH SAILINGS TO CUBAN PORTS OTHER THAN HAVANA ONLY ABOUT EVERY THREE WEEKS THE NEW YORK AND CUBA MAIL AND THE HAMBURG AMERICANS ATLAS SERVICE ARE THE ONLY LINES CONNECTING NEW YORK WITH SOUTH CUBAN PORTS WHILE NO UNDERSTANDING EXISTS BETWEEN THE LINES THE FREIGHT TRAFFIC MANAGER OF THE ATLAS SERVICE TESTIFIED THAT THE TWO LINES AIM NOT TO UNDERQUOTE EACH OTHER AND IF THE NEW YORK AND CUBA MAIL FIXES A RATE ON A CERTAIN COMMODITY THEY WILL PROBABLY TELL US OF IT OR WE WILL LEARN OF IT IN THE MARKET AND WILL ADJUST OUR RATES ACCORDINGLY THE EVENTUAL RESULT OF THIS AD JUSTMENT HE FURTHER EXPLAINED IS THAT THE LINES HAVE THE SAME RATES BETWEEN NEW YORK AND SANTIAGO BOTH SOUTHBOUND AND NORTHBOUND ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE AN OCCASIONAL UNDERQUOTING OF RATES BECAUSE ONE LINE MAY NOT HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE OTHER IS DOING 2 THREE LINES CONTROL THE TRADE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND HAITI VIZ THE ATLAS SERVICE OF THE HAMBURGAMERICAN LINE AND THE ROYAL DUTCH WEST INDIA MAIL LINE FROM NEW YORK AND THE SEEBERG LINE FROM MOBILE THE LAST BEING THE ONLY LINE FROM ASTEAMSMIP LINE AGREEMENTS 93 SOUTHERN PORT THE CLYDE LINE ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE ONLY LINE SERVING THE PORTS OF SANTO DOMINGO UNTIL THE CLOSE OF 1912 THE TWO LINES CONNECTING HAITI WITH NEW YORK WERE PARTIES TO A POOLING AGREEMENT WHICH HAD FOR ITS PURPOSE THE DIVISION OF PORTS IN HAITI BETWEEN THE LINES THE FIXING AND MAINTENANCE OF FREIGHT AND PASSENGER RATES AND THE POOLING OF A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THE EARN INGS ALTHOUGH DISCONTINUED ON DECEMBER 21 1912 BOTH LINES CON TINUED TO OBSERVE THE SAME RATES AND CONDITIONS IN THE FREIGHT TRAFFIC THE HAMBURGAMERICAN LINE ALSO HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ROYAL MAIL STEAM PACKET CO WHEREBY THE LATTER AGREES NOT TO EXTEND ITS SERVICE TO HAITIAN PORTS

THE RAILROADS COULD TO A GREAT DEGREE CONTROL THE MOVEMENT OF THIS FREIGHT AND AS MR JULIUS BARNES OF DULUTH TESTIFIED SO LONG AS THIS CLASS OF FREIGHT ORIGINATES ON THE RAILROADS AND IS CONTROLLED BY THEM IT IS IN THEIR POWER TO SAY TO WHOM THEY WILL GIVE IT AND THEY WILL NOT SHARE IT WITH ANY INDIVIDUAL CARRIER THAT MIGHT OFFER AS A FURTHER OBSTACLE TO THE OPERATION OF INDEPENDENT LINES THE RAILROADS HAVE PURSUED THE PRACTICE OF CHARGING MORE FOR THE LOCAL HAUL FROM BUFFALO TO SEABOARD POINTS ON CERTAIN COMMODITIES THAT ARE TAKEN TO BUFFALO BY BOAT THAN THE PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE ALLRAIL HAUL FROM CHICAGO TO THE SEABOARD THUS MAKING THE THROUGH RAILWATER ROUTE UNPROFITABLE AS REGARDS AN INDEPENDENT LINE AS COM PARED WITH THE ALLRAIL ROUTE IE THE LOCAL RATE FOR THE EASTERN RAIL HAUL WAS MADE SO HIGH AS TO LEAVE LITTLE TO THE INDEPENDENT WATER CARRIER FOR ITS LOCAL LAKE HAUL ASSUMING THAT INDEPENDENT LINES COULD OVERCOME THE AFORE MENTIONED OBSTACLES THEY WOULD NEXT FIND THAT THE RAILROADS HAVE SECURED NEARLY ALL THE WATER FRONTAGE AT BUFFALO AVAILABLE FOR DOCK PURPOSES THE RAILROADS COULD ALSO REFUSE TO GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THEIR DOCK FACILITIES BOTH FOR THE DISCHARGING AND RECEIVING OF CARGO THUS COMPELLING THEM TO LOAD AND UNLOAD AT SOME OTHER DOCK AND TEAM THE GOODS TO OR FROM THE RAILROAD STATION AT THE SAME TIME THE RAILROADS HAVE SECURED EFFECTIVE

TOTAL OF 274 VESSELS WITH A TOTAL TONNAGE OF 1233868 GROSS TONS OR NEARLY 46 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL AMERICAN GREAT LAKES TONNAGE NOT ENGAGED IN LINE TRAFFIC AN EXAMINATION OF THE PERSONNEL OF THE MANAGEMENTS AND THE CHARTER RELATIONS FURTHER SERVED TO INDICATE THAT THESE EIGHT CONSOLIDATIONS OF BULK CARRIERS ARE THEMSELVES CLOSELY INTERRELATED A FURTHER COMPARISON OF THE OFFICIALS LEADING STOCKHOLDERS AND CHARTER RELATIONS OF OTHER AMERICAN BULK CARRYING COMPANIES ON THE GREAT LAKES SHOWED THAT THE AFOREMENTIONED EIGHT LEADING CONSOLIDATIONS WERE SO CLOSELY INTERRELATED WITH 29 OTHER GROUPS OF LESSER IMPOR TANCE AS TO WARRANT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ENTIRE LIST OF 37 GROUPS COMPRISING 105 COMPANIES FIRMS AND MANAGEMENTS REPRESENTS A VAST COMMUNITY OF INTEREST WHICH IF FOUND NECESSARY COULD EASILY BE DOMINATED BY THE LEADING INTERESTS THEREIN AS REGARDS RATES AND BUSINESS POLICY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS COMMUNITY OF INTEREST BECOMES APPAR ENT WHEN VIEWED FROM THE

TONNAGE OF 2939933 IT APPEARS THAT THE 37 AFFILIATED GROUPS OF BULK CARRIERS CONTROL APPROXIMATELY 85 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL AMERICAN GREAT LAKES TONNAGE THEIR IMPORTANCE IS ALSO INDICATED BY THE FACT

ROUTE COMPRISES THE PANAMA R R STEAMSHIP LINE FROM NEW YORK TO COLON THE PANAMA R R CO ACROSS THE ISTHMUS AND UNTIL RECENTLY TWO PACIFIC COAST SERVICES VIZ THE PACIFIC MAIL STEAMSHIP CO AND THE CALIFORNIA ATLANTIC STEAMSHIP CO THE SUNSETGULF ROUTE CONSISTS OF THE COMBINED RAIL AND WATER LINES OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC CO ITS STEAMERS OPERATING BETWEEN NEW YORK AND NEW ORLEANS AND GALVESTON THE GULF TERMINI OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC THUS ENABLING THE RAILROAD COMPANY TO COMPETE NOT ONLY WITH OTHER TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROADS BUT WITH THE SEVERAL INTER COASTAL WATER ROUTES WHILE THE RATES OF THE SUNSETGULF ROUTE ARE THE SAME AS THE ALLRAIL CHARGES THE RATES ON THE TWO ISTHMIAN ROUTES ARE FROM 20 TO 60 PER CENT BELOW THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY TARIFFS FIXED DIFFERENTIALS HOWEVER DO NOT EXIST THE WATER RATES BEING MADE SUFFICIENTLY LOWER THAN THE RAIL CHARGES TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT VOLUME OF DESIRABLE FREIGHT A COMPARISON OF THE PANAMA LINES RATES WITH THOSE OF THE AMERICANHAWAIIAN LINE SHOWS THEM TO BE THE SAME 12 FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION SEE PP 357365 OF THE REPORT ON STEAMSHIP AGREE MENTS AND AFFILIATIONS IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRADESTEAMSHIP LINE AGREEMENTS 103 FOR ABOUT ONETHIRD OF THE ARTICLES ENUMERATED WHILE FOR THE BALANCE THE PANAMA RATES SLIGHTLY EXCEED THE TEHUANTEPEC RATES AND VICE VERSA AT THE TIME OF THE COMMITTEES INVESTIGATION THE PANAMA R R CO HAD A TRAFFIC ARRANGEMENT WITH THE PACIFIC MAIL AND CALIFORNIA ATLANTIC LINES FOR THE EXCHANGE OF FREIGHT AND THE PACIFIC MAIL REGULARLY ADVISED THE PANAMA R R CO WHENEVER IT AGREED WITH THE CALIFORNIAATLANTIC LINE TO PUT INTO EFFECT CERTAIN CHANGES IN RATES FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO NEW YORK THE AMERICANHAWAIIAN LINE HOWEVER IS NOT A PARTY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO ANY UNDER STANDING WITH EITHER THE PANAMA R R CO OR ITS TWO CONNECTING CARRIERS ALTHOUGH MR R P SCHWERIN VICEPRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER OF THE PACIFIC MAIL TESTIFIED THAT THE AMERICANHAWAIIAN LINE WAS MAINTAINING RATES WITH THE OTHER LINES INLAND RIVERS AND CANALS AS CONTRASTED WITH THE GREAT INCREASE OF TRAFFIC IN THE COASTWISE AND GREAT LAKES TRADE TRAFFIC ON THIS COUNTRYS INLAND RIVERS AND CANALS HAS DECREASED BOTH RELATIVELY AND ABSOUTELY MOST OF THE CANALS HAVE LONG SINCE PASSED UNDER THE CONTROL OF COMPETING RAILROADS WITH THE RESULT THAT THE RAILROADS ALMOST INVARIABLY ABANDONED OR FAILED TO MAINTAIN THE SAME PROPERLY OR RAISED THE TOLLS SO HIGH AS TO PRECLUDE THEIR USE MANY OF THE CANALS HOWEVER OWING TO THEIR ANTIQUATED CHARACTER WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD HAVE CEASED TO EXIST BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO MEET THE LEGITIMATE COMPETITION OF THE RAILROADS EVEN THE ERIE CANAL IS DOMINATED TO SUCH AN EXTENT BY THE RAILROADS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THROUGH FREIGHT ORIGINATING OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK VIA THIS ROUTE HAS ALMOST REACHED THE VANISHING POINT THE RAILROADS OWNING ALL THE THROUGH LAKE LINES AND CONTROLLING PRACTICALLY ALL THE TERMINAL FACILITIES AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CANAL AS WELL AS THE LEADING CANAL FOR WARDING AGENCIES AND BOAT OWNERS MUCH THE SAME SITUATION ALSO EXISTS ON THE COUNTRYS LEADING RIVERS NOT ONLY HAS TRANSPORTATION ON THESE WATERWAYS DECLINED BECAUSE OF THE NATURAL EXTENSION AND LEGITIMATE COMPETITION OF THE RAILROADS BUT AS POINTED OUT ELSEWHERE1 THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE RAILROADS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY OP POSED THE MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF RIVER AND CANAL TRAFFIC BY A VARIETY OF EFFECTIVE METHODS MAINLY BY ACQUIRING COMPETITIVE WATER LINES AND CANALS BY OBTAINING CONTROL OF THE TERMINAL FACILITIES BY THE USE OF REBATES OR BY THE 1I IBID PP 406407104 THE ANNALS OF THEE AMERICAN ACADEMY UNDERCUTTING OF RATES ASIDE FROM THE ACQUISITION OF COMPETING LINES THE UNDER CUTTING OF RATES SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE FAVORITE METHOD ADOPTED BY RAILROADS TO ELIMINATE WATER COMPETITORS SINCE THE RAILROADS REACH ALL SECTIONS OF THE IN TERIOR AND THE INLAND NAVIGATION LINES ARE RESTRICTED TO THEIR WATER COURSE THEY CAN EASILY CONTROL SO LARGE A PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL FREIGHT AS TO LEAVE THE WATER LINES INSUFFICIENT FREIGHT TO MAINTAIN PROPER TERMINALS AND AN EFFICIENT SERVICE CONCLUSIONS HAVING OUTLINED BRIEFLY THE RELATIONS BETWEEN STEAMSHIP LINES OPERATING ON ALL THE IMPORTANT ROUTES OF OUR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC COMMERCE WE MAY NEXT SUMMARIZE THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH MAY BE DRAWN FROM A STUDY OF AGREEMENTS AND OTHER AFFILIATIONS CONSIDERED COLLECTIVELY SIX LEADING CONCLUSIONS SUGGEST THEMSELVES NAMELY 1 THE EXISTENCE OF COIPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE ELIMINA TION OF UNRESTRAINED COMPETITION IN RATES BETWEEN STEAMSHIP LINES ENGAGING IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN TRADE MAY BE SAID TO BE WELL NIGH UNIVERSAL IN FACT FOREIGN LINES FRANKLY CONTEND THAT SUCH COOPER ATIVE METHODS ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IN OCEAN TRANSPORTATION IF SHIP OWNERS ARE TO SECURE A DEPENDABLE RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT SUFFICIENTLY LARGE TO PROVIDE FOR THE PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRADE AND THE EFFICIENT HANDLING OF THE TRAFFIC AND IF SHIPPERS ARE TO ENJOY AN AMPLE FREQUENT AND REGULAR SERVICE AT STABLE RATES AND BE PRO TECTED AGAINST SECRET ARRANGEMENTS WITH COMPETITORS THE FEW IN STANCES WHERE TWO OR MORE LINES SERVE THE SAME ROUTE AND SEEM NOT TO OPERATE UNDER WRITTEN OR ORAL AGREEMENTS FOR THE REGULATION OF THE TRADE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND NOT THE RULE BUT IN NEARLY EVERY SUCH INSTANCE ONE LINE IN THE TRADE WAS FOUND TO BE SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL TO DOMINATE THE OTHERS AND WITHOUT EFFECTING ANY DEFINITE UNDERSTANDING SECURE THE DESIRED CONDITION IN RATES IN PRACTICALLY EVERY CASE THE FEW SMALL COMPETITORS ARE ALLOWED TO OPERATE BY THE DOMINANT CARRIER WITHOUT OPPOSITION SO LONG AS THEY CHARGE THE SAME RATES OR OBSERVE A CERTAIN DIFFERENTIAL FOR THESE SMALLER LINES TO START A RATE WAR WITH THE DOMINANT CARRIER WOULD MEAN THEIR SPEEDY ABSORPTION OR ELIMINATION IN SOME INSTANCES ALSO THE POWERFUL LINE MAY NOT ESPECIALLY FOR LEGAL REASONS HAVE SEEN FIT TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT OR TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A CONFERENCE YET IN NEARLY EVERY SUCH CASE THE NONCONFERENCE LINE WAS FOUND TO WORK IN FRIENDLY CODPERATION WITH THE CONFERENCE LINES AS REGARDS RATES A FEW INSTANCES WERE EVEN FOUND WHERE AN IMPORTANT LINE DELIBERATELY WITHDREW FROM THESTEAMSHIP LINE AGREEMENTS 105 CONFERENCE AND YET THE CONFERENCE LINE REPRESENTATIVES TESTIFIED THAT THEY KEPT THE NONCONFERENCE LINE POSTED AS TO THE RATES THEY WERE CHARGING ALTHOUGH UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO DO SO THAT THE NONCON FERENCE LINE MAINTAINED THESE RATES AND THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN IT AND THE COMBINATION LINES REMAINED AS CORDIAL AS THEY WERE WHEN THE LINE BELONGED TO THE CONFERENCE 2 AN ANALYSIS OF THE NUMEROUS AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN CARRIERS IN THE FOREIGN TRADE SHOWS THAT THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN THEIR DETAILS AND THAT IN MOST INSTANCES THEY HAVE BEEN ADAPTED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PARTICULAR TRADES TO WHICH THEY APPLY OR THE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE LINES WHICH ARE PARTIES TO THE AR RANGEMENTS14 BROADLY SPEAKING THE VARIOUS AGREEMENTS AND UNDER STANDINGS MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS FOLLOWS A RATE AGREEMENTS WHICH MAY BE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO FIXED RATE AGREEMENTS MINIMUM RATE AGREEMENTS AND DIFFERENTIAL RATE AGREEMENTS FIXED RATE AGREEMENTS5 AIM TO HAVE THE LINES MAINTAIN DEFINITELY FIXED RATES AS PRESCRIBED IN THE AGREEMENT OR IN THE TARIFFS AGREED UPON ALL CHANGES IN SUCH RATES TO BE MADE ONLY BY MUTUAL CONSENT SOMETIMES STEAMERS ARE ALLOWED TO ACCEPT CERTAIN HEAVY FREIGHT NOT EXCEEDING A CERTAIN DESIGNATED TOTAL AT LESS THAN THE PRESCRIBED RATES MINIMUM RATE UNDERSTANDINGS6 IN THE FREIGHT TRAFFIC USUALLY PROVIDE THAT THE LINES CANNOT FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME USUALLY THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS AND AS REGARDS A DESIGNATED LIST OF ARTICLES TAKE FREIGHT EXCEPT CERTAIN DESIGNATED BULK ARTICLES AT RATES BELOW AN AGREED MINIMUM ANY LINE HOWEVER CAN SERVE NOTICE THAT AT THE END OF THE DESIGNATED PERIOD IT WILL CHANGE THESE RATES DIFFERENTIAL RATE 14 FOR A DETAILED CLASSIFICATION OF AGREEMENTS AND CONFERENCE ARRANGEMENTS SEE PP 281293 OF THE REPORT ON STEAMSHIP AGREEMENTS AND AFFILIATIONS IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRADE IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MANY OF THE AGREEMENTS REPRESENT A COMBINATION OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF AGREEMENTS REFERRED TO IE AGREEMENTS MAY COMBINE THE FEATURES OF POOLING EARNINGS FIXING RATES GRANTING DEFERRED REBATES REGULATING SAILINGS ETC IN A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF INSTANCES AGREEMENTS ARE ALSO EFFECTED BETWEEN GROUPS OF CONFERENCE LINES 15 ILLUSTRATED BY THE N D L V FREIGHT AGREEMENT THE BALTIC POOL AGREE MENTS THE MEDITERRANEAN FREIGHT AGREEMENT AND THE

AS AN EXAMPLE THE ARRANGEMENT IT WILL BE RECALLED PROVIDES THAT THE MEASUREMENT CARGO CARRIED BY THE WHITE STAR LINE FROM NEW YORK VIA LIVERPOOL FOR AUSTRALIA SHALL NOT EXCEED ONEFOURTH OF THE AGGREGATE MEASUREMENT CARGO TAKEN BY ALL FOUR LINES E AGREEMENTS PROVIDING FOR THE POOLING OF ALL OR A PORTION OF THE FREIGHT MONEY COLLECTEDONLY BRIEF REFERENCE NEED BE MADE TO THIS TYPE OF AGREEMENT SINCE THE SUBJECT IS DISCUSSED IN ANOTHER ARTICLE IN THIS VOLUME USUALLY SUCH POOLING ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE AFTER DEDUCTING CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO MEET THE COST OF OPERATING THE STEAM ERS FOR THE DIVISION OF EARNINGS IN CERTAIN AGREED PROPORTIONS AMONG THE LINES WHICH ARE PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT SOMETIMES SUCH AGREE MENTS ARE ENTERED INTO BY TWO GROUPS OF LINES EACH GROUP RECEIVING A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL FREIGHT CARRIED BY ALL THE LINES IN OTHER INSTANCES THE SEVERAL LINES EACH RECEIVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE EARNINGS AND ONLY THE BALANCE IS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SIG NATORIES F AGREEMENTS PROVIDING FOR THE PAYMENT OF DEFERRED REBATESTHIS TYPE OF AGREEMENT ALLOWS TO SHIPPERS WHO AGREE TO EMPLOY EXCLU SIVELY THE STEAMERS OF THE CONFERENCE LINES IN A GIVEN TRADE A REFUND OF A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE USUALLY 5 OR 10 PER CENT BUT SOMETIMES AS HIGH AS 20 PER CENT OF THEIR FREIGHT PAYMENTS DURING A CERTAIN STIPULATED PERIOD USUALLY EVERY SIX OR TWELVE MONTHS BUT WHILE THE REBATE IS COMPUTED FOR THESE PERIODS IT IS NOT PAID UNTIL AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MONTHS USUALLY THREE OR SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PERIOD FOR WHICH IT IS COMPUTED AND ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT DURING THE ENTIRE TIME INCLUDING BOTH THE PERIOD FOR WHICH THE REBATE WAS COMPUTED AS WELL AS THE TIME OF DEFERMENT THE SHIPPER HAS GIVEN HIS EXCLUSIVE SUPPORT TO THE CONFERENCE LINES SUCH REBATES ARE AL LOWED IN THE IMPORT TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES IN A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF INSTANCES ESPECIALLY IN LONGDISTANCE TRADES SUCH AS THOSE FROM ORIENTAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN PORTS ALTHOUGH VARIOUS CONFERENCES HAVE IN RECENT YEARS DISCONTINUED THE SYSTEM THE FACTS PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE SHOW THAT THIS METHOD HAS PROVED ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE DEVICES FOR THE CONTROL OF THE TRADE SINCE THE TIME OF PAYMENT OF THE REBATES FOLLOWS THE PERIOD FOR WHICH THEY ARE COM PUTED THE SHIPPER IF HE DESIRES TO OBTAIN THE SAME SOMETIMES REACHING LARGE PROPORTIONS IS KEPT UNDER CONSTANT OBLIGATION TO THE108 THE ANNALS OF THEI AMERICAN ACADEMY CONFERENCE LINES AND IS PREVENTED FROM PATRONIZING ANY OTHER SERV ICE SINCE THAT ACT WOULD MEAN THE FORFEITURE OF ALL ACCUMULATED REBATES THE REBATE SYSTEMS NOW IN USE IT MAY BE ADDED ARE OPEN EQUALLY TO ALL SHIPPERS WHO AGREE TO GIVE EXCLUSIVE PATRONAGE AND ARE GRANTED WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION AS REGARDS THE SIZE OF INDI VIDUAL OR TOTAL SHIPMENTS 3 THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED TENDENCY IN RECENT YEARS FOR VAR IOUS CONFERENCE LINES TO DISCONTINUE THE USE OF DEFERRED REBATE SYSTEMS MOREOVER SUCH REBATES APPLY IN NEARLY ALL CASES TO THE AMERICAN IMPORT TRADE ONLY THREE INSTANCES HAVING BEEN FOUND BY THE COMMITTEE WHERE SUCH REBATES ARE GRANTED IN THE EXPORT TRAFFIC FROM AMERICAN PORTS AS STATED IN THE REPORT TO THE COMMITTEE19 WITH REFERENCE TO THE AMERICAN EXPORT TRADE IT SEEMS THAT THE LINES ARE LABORING UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT DEFERRED REBATES ARE ILLEGAL AND IN SOME CASES WHERE SUCH REBATES FORMERLY EXISTED THEY HAVE BEEN ABANDONED AND WHERE THEIR ADOPTION HAS BEEN TAKEN UNDER CONSIDERATION A DECISION WAS REACHED NOT TO ESTABLISH THE SAME IN THE IMPORT TRADE ON THE CONTRARY THE LINES APPEAR TO GO ON THE THEORY THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE MATTER AND THAT SUCH REBATES MAY BE FREELY GRANTED IF THE ARRANGEMENT IS MADE ABROAD AND IF THE REBATES ARE PAID AT A FOREIGN PORT BUT IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE DEFERRED REBATE SYSTEM ALTHOUGH APPLIED ONLY TO THE IMPORT TRAFFIC IS NEVERTHELESS A VERY EFFECTIVE DEVICE FOR THE CONTROL OF THE TRADE SINCE TO MAKE THE TRADE PROFITABLE AN INDEPENDENT LINE MUST HAVE CARGO IN BOTH DIRECTIONS 4 WHERE WRITTEN OR ORAL AGREEMENTS GOVERN THE RATES AND METHODS OF THE LINES THE TERMS THEREOF HAVE GENERALLY BEEN GUARDED WITH THE UTMOST SECRECY IN FACT ONE OF THE CHIEF OBJECTIONS OF MANY SHIPPERS TO STEAMSHIP CONFERENCES AND AGREEMENTS AS NOW CONDUCTED IS THAT THEY ARE SECRET IN MOST INSTANCES AND THAT SHIPPERS THEREFORE HAVE NO MEANS OF KNOWING WHETHER THE CONTENTIONS OF THE LINES FOR SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE TRUE OR NOT ALTHOUGH SOME LINES ENGAGED IN THE FOREIGN COMMERCE SHOWED A VERY COMMENDABLE ATTITUDE IN FRANKLY OFFERING TO SUBMIT THEIR AGREEMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE MERCHANT MARINE AND FISHERIES DURING ITS INVESTIGATION IT IS NOTE WORTHY THAT ONLY 88 OUT OF 208 FOREIGN LINES SAW FIT TO RESPOND AT ALL TO THE COMMITTEES REQUEST FOR INFORMATION A CONSIDERABLE NUM BER OF THE LINES OBJECTED TO ANY PUBLICITY BEING GIVEN TO THEIR AGREE MENTS BY THE COMMITTEE CHIEFLY ON THE GROUND THAT SUCH PUBLICITY WOULD ENABLE OTHER LINES TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR BUSINESS METHODS IN THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CASES AS WAS SHOWN BY THE TESTI 19 REPORT ON STEAMSHIP AGREEMENTS AND AFFILIATIONS IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRADE PP 288289STAMSMHP LINE AGREEMENTB 109 MONY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE THE AGREEMENTS WERE IN THE POSSESSION OF ONLY THE FOREIGN PRINCIPALS OF THE LINES MOST AMERICAN REPRE SENTATIVES OF THE LINES EXPRESSING A MERE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR EXISTENCE AND AN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF THEIR PROVISIONS SO PREVALENT WAS THE SPIRIT OF SECRECY SURROUNDING SUCH AGREEMENTS AND SO GEN ERAL THE OBJECTIONS OF SHIPPERS TO SUCH SECRECY THAT THE COMMITTEE SAW FIT TO REPORT TO CONGRESS THAT ALL CARRIERS BY WATER SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO FILE FOR APPROVAL WITH THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMIS SION A TRUE COPY OR IF ORAL A TRUE AND COMPLETE MEMORANDUM OF EVERY AGREEMENT UNDERSTANDING CONFERENCE OR OTHER ARRANGEMENT TO WHICH THEY ARE PARTIES OR TO WHICH THEY CONFORM IN WHOLE OR IN PART 5 NOT ONLY ARE PRACTICALLY ALL THE CONFERENCE RELATIONS BETWEEN LINES IN THE DOMESTIC TRADE VERBAL IN CHARACTER BUT A DECIDED TEND ENCY TOWARD ORAL UNDERSTANDINGS AS DISTINGUISHED FROM WRITTEN AGREEMENTS HAS ALSO MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE FOREIGN TRADE ABOUT ONEHALF OF THE COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE FOREIGN TRADE ARE ORAL IN CHARACTER MANY AGREEMENTS WERE OF AN ORAL NATURE FROM THEIR INCEPTION WHILE IN SEVERAL INSTANCES WRITTEN AGREEMENTS WERE UPON THEIR TERMINATION RENEWED IN THE FORM OF ORAL UNDERSTANDINGS THE STEAMSHIP LINE REPRESENTATIVES HOWEVER ADMITTING THAT THE LINES CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE SAME RATES AND CONDITIONS WHICH WERE PRE VIOUSLY OBSERVED UNDER THE WRITTEN AGREEMENTS WITNESSES BEFORE THE COMMITTEE REPEATEDLY DREW THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FORMAL WRITTEN AGREEMENTS AND ORAL OR TACIT UNDERSTANDINGS AND SEEMED TO REGARD ORAL UNDERSTANDINGS AS SAFER THAN WRITTEN AGREEMENTS THE EF FECTIVENESS OF ORAL AGREEMENTS HOWEVER WAS GENERALLY ADMITTED TO BE AS DEPENDABLE AS THAT OF WRITTEN AGREEMENTS AS STATED IN MY REPORT IN THIS CONNECTION20 WHILE NOT INVOLVING AS STRONG A MORAL OBLIGATION AS WRITTEN AGREEMENTS THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES ORAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE QUITE AS EFFECTIVE JUDGING FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH THE LINES OBSERVE THE SAME THE EXISTING ORAL UNDERSTANDINGS GIVE UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF THE HIGH ORDER OF INTEGRITY PREVAILING IN MODERN BUSINESS AND JUSTIFY FULLY THE PHRASE GENTLE MENS AGREEMENTS WRITTEN AGREEMENTS SEEM TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THEIR PUR POSE IN MANY TRADES AND ARE APPARENTLY NO LONGER NEEDED THE LINES IN SOME INSTANCES NEED NOT EVEN MEET IN CONFERENCE THEY MAY AVOID EVERY APPEARANCE AND EVERY ACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF AN AGREEMENT OR UNDER 20 IBID P 294110 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEIM STANDING AND YET OPERATE IN THE SAME SPIRIT OF HARMONY THAT WOULD PREVAIL IF A WRITTEN AGREEMENT EXISTED THERE IS STILL FRIENDLY RIVALRY IN PROCURING BUSINESS BUT THIS BUSINESS IS SECURED AT NOT LESS THAN CERTAIN UNDERSTOOD RATES AGAIN IN NEARLY ALL OF THE FEW TRADES WHERE AGREEMENTS OR UNDERSTANDINGS HAVE BEEN DENIED BY ALL THE INTERESTED LINES A REMARKABLE UNIFORMITY IN RATES SEEMS TO EXIST AND NOT A TRACE OF A RATE WAR CAN BE FOUND THE SITUATION HAS BEEN EX PLAINED TO THE COMMITTEE AS ONE OF FOLLOWING THE LEADER THE DOMINANT CARRIER FIXING THE RATES AND THE LESS IMPORTANT LINES ADOPTING THOSE RATES THEY BEING ALLOWED TO EXIST IN THE TRADE WITHOUT HAVING AN EFFECTIVE FIGHT WAGED AGAINST THEM AS LONG AS THEY CONFORM TO THE RATES AND CONDITIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE DOMINANT CARRIER 6 UNLIKE THE PRACTICE IN THE FOREIGN TRADE DEFINITE AGREEMENTS TO CHARGE CERTAIN RATES TO DIVIDE TERRITORY OR REGULATE SAILINGS TO POOL TRAFFIC TO IMPOSE DEFERRED REBATE STIPULATIONS ETC ARE VERY FEW IN THE DOMESTIC TRAFFIC CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF THEIR PROB ABLE ILLEGALITY UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS SUCH AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY AVOIDED YET THE PRESENCE OF ANY REAL COMPETITION BETWEEN THE LINES IN RATES IS QUITE AS DIFFICULT TO FIND IN THIS TRADE AS IN THE FOREIGN TRADE THE DESIRED ELIMINATION OF OBJECTIONABLE COMPETI TION HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN MANY OTHER WAYS THAN THROUGH THE EFFECTING OF DEFINITE AGREEMENTS WHICH MAY NOT STAND THE TEST OF LEGALITY SOME TWENTYEIGHT METHODS OF CONTROLLING COMPETITION BETWEEN DOMESTIC CARRIERS BY WATER HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO SEE APPENDIX II OF THIS VOLUME AND MOST OF THEM RELATE TO CONTROL THROUGH 1 THE ACQUISITION OF WATER LINES BY RAILROADS OR BY OTHER CARRIERS BY WATER 2 THE CONTROL BY PURCHASE OR OTHERWISE OF ACCES SORIES TO THE LINES AND 3 THE THROTTLING OF INDEPENDENT COMPETITORS BY VARIOUS SPECIAL PRACTICES WHICH MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SECURE BUSINESS ON ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS WHERE ONE METHOD WOULD NOT ACCOMPLISH THE ELIMINATION OF A WEAK COMPETITOR ANOTHER COULD BE EASILY SUBSTITUTED AND IN GENERAL ONE IS WARRANTED IN SAYING THAT THE METHODS OF CONTROL USED BY DOMESTIC CARRIERS HAVE BEEN QUITE AS EFFECTIVE IN ELIMINATING COMPETITION IN RATES IF NOT MORE SO THAN ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS PREVAILING IN THE FOREIGN TRADE CONFERENCE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE FOREIGN TRADE ARE BINDING ON THE MEMBERS IN THE DOMESTIC TRADE ON THE CONTRARY TRAFFIC ASSO CIATIONS AND CONFERENCES PARTICIPATED IN BY WATER CARRIERS DO NOT DEFINITELY BIND THE LINES IE THERE IS NO EXPRESS AGREEMENT TO OBSERVE THE RATES ONE OF THE MOST NOTICEABLE FEATURES OF THE COMMITTEES INVESTIGATION WAS THE PAINSTAKING AND EMPHATIC MANNER IN WHICHSTEAMSHIP LINE AGREEMENTS 111 THE REPRESENTATIVES OF DOMESTIC LINES REPORTED TO THE COMMITTEE THAT THEIR AFFILIATION WITH EXISTING TRAFFIC ASSOCIATIONS OR CONFERENCES IS SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCUSSION AND INTERCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND OPINIONS ON MATTERS OF MUTUAL INTEREST AND THAT THEIR RIGHTS OF SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT ACTION ARE IN NO WAY RESTRICTED YET THE TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE SHOWED THAT THE RATES AND DIVI SIONS OF RATES ARE DETERMINED ATTHESE CONFERENCES IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO CAUSE NO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ANY OF THE MEMBERS IT IS ALSO NOTEWORTHY THAT IN A NUMBER OF TRADES WHERE NOT A TRACE OF A RATE WAR COULD BE FOUND THE SEVERAL LINES OPERATING ON THE ROUTE REPORTED UNDER OATH THAT THEY HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OR WORKING ARRANGEMENT WHATSOEVER WITH ANY OF THE OTHER LINES EXCEPT THAT EACH LINE OF ITS OWN VOLITION GENERALLY NOTIFIES THE OTHER LINES OF CHANGES IN ITS RATES AND RECEIVES SIMILAR NOTIFICATION FROM THEM EACH LINE MAY THEN DO AS IT PLEASES SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ARE TRULY GENTLEMENS UNDERSTANDINGS AND ONE IS PROMPTED TO ASK HOW LONG IT WILL BE BEFORE DEFINITE AGREEMENTS WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL WILL NO LONGER BE NEEDED NOTE IN ADDITION TO THE REPORT ON STEAMSHIP AGREEMENTS AND AFFILIATIONS IN THE AMERICAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TRADE TO WHICH REFERENCE HAS BEEN MADE REPEATEDLY IN THIS ARTICLE THE

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075086,BOYS IN COMPOSITION,I244558,BOYS IN COMPOSITION THREE YEARS AGO A GRADUATE OF PRINCETON ACCEPTED THE POSI TION OF INSTRUCTOR IN ENGLISH IN THE LARGEST HIGH SCHOOL FOR BOYS IN ONE OF OUR EASTERN CITIES ONE PART OF HIS WORK WAS TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE COURSES IN COMPOSITION WHICH HAD NECESSARILY BEEN NEGLECTED BY THE SMALL CORPS OF TEACHERS WHO WERE ALREADY OVER WORKED WITH THE COURSES IN THE HISTORY OF LITERATURE HE FOUND THAT FEW OF THE STUDENTS COULD WRITE DOWN THEIR THOUGHTS COR RECTLY AND STILL FEWER HAD ANY IDEA OF THE CONSTRUCTIVE UNITY AND PROPORTION OF AN ESSAY THEY REALLY HAD HAD NO TRAINING IN WRITING AT LONG INTERVALS DURING THEIR FIRST YEAR THEY HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO HAND IN SHORT COMPOSITIONS ABOUT SOME BOOK SUCH AS HAWTHORNES TWICE TOLD TALES OR ABOUT THE LIFE OF SOME AUTHOR SUCH AS POE THESE COMPOSITIONS WERE SELDOM IF EVER CORRECTED AND THE STUDENTS ATTENTION WAS NEVER CALLED TO HIS ERRORS IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO DISCOVER THAT THE BOYS WERE NOT LEARNING THE PRACTICAL USE OF THEIR LANGUAGE FOR INSTANCE THEIR EXAMINATION PAPERS WERE USUALLY COLLECTIONS OF DISCONNECTED PHRASES FROM WHICH ONLY A SKILFUL INTERPRETER COULD DECIPHER THE MEANING THE INSTRUCTOR DETERMINED TO EXPERIMENT WITH A SECONDYEAR CLASS THREE HUNDRED IN NUMBER WHO CAME TO HIM ONCE A WEEK FOR COMPOSITION HE BELIEVED THAT BRIEF REGULAR PRACTICE WOULD TEACH THEM TO EXPRESS THEIR ORDINARY THOUGHTS CLEARLY AND CON CISELY EACH WEEK EACH BOY WAS REQUIRED TO HAND IN A COMPOSI TION VARYING IN LENGTH FROM ONE TO SIX HUNDRED WORDS ACCORDING TO THE SUBJECT THE FREQUENCY OF THESE COMPOSITIONS REQUIRED A CHANGE IN THE CHARACTER OF THE SUBJECTS AND THE METHOD OF SELECTING THEM THE OLD SUBJECTS OF BOOKS AND BIOGRAPHIES WERE DISCARDED BECAUSE THE STUDENTS DID NOT HAVE TIME FOR SO MUCH READING SOON THESE SUBJECTS WERE ENTIRELY FORBIDDEN BECAUSE THE INSTRUCTOR FOUND THAT SUCH COMPOSITIONS WERE MERELY PATCH WORKS OF EXTRACTS LONGER OR SHORTER FROM THE BOOKS BOYS WOULD COPY ENTIRE PHRASES SENTENCES AND PARAGRAPHS WITHOUT 636BOYS IN COMPOSITION UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OR APPRECIATING THE FORCE OF THE SEPA RATE WORDS THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO USE THE SAME WORDS IN ANY CONSTRUCTIONS EXCEPT THOSE OF THE BOOK THE CHIEF VALUE OF THIS NOTETAKING METHOD OF TEACHING COM POSITION IS SUPPOSED TO CONSIST IN ITS TRIPLE FUNCTION OF GIVING THE STUDENT AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH STANDARD LITERATURE AN ENRICHED VOCABULARY AND THE ABILITY TO WRITE CORRECT ENGLISH IN ATTEMPT ING TOO MUCH IT FAILS IN EVERY PART FEW BOYS FIND ANY PLEASURE IN BOOKS WHICH THEY ARE FORCED TO READ FOR SCHOOL WORK TOO OFTEN THE REMARK IS HEARD I NEVER LIKED THAT BOOK I HAD TO READ IT IN SCHOOL THE ACQUAINTANCE WITH LITERATURE WHICH IS ACQUIRED IN SCHOOL COMES CHIEFLY AND MOST EFFECTIVELY FROM THE STIMULATING INTERPRETATION OF THE TEACHER IN COMPOSITIONS ON BOOKS THE LANGUAGE IS ALWAYS SUBORDINATED TO THE STORY CRITICISM ASKS IS THE OUTLINE OF THE STORY CORRECT AND FORGETS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEAN ING  IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT A BOYS VOCABULARY IS ENRICHED BUT TOO OFTEN THIS ENRICHMENT IS ONLY IN BULK AND NOT IN USEFUL NESS THE AIM OF A COURSE IN COMPOSITION SHOULD BE TO ENABLE THE BOYS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES CLEARLY AND CONCISELY WHENEVER THEY MAY HAVE OCCASION TO WRITE OF THEIR DAILY EXPERIENCES FOR THIS PURPOSE IT IS BETTER TO TRAIN THEM TO USE SKILFULLY AND EASILY A SMALL VOCABULARY THAN MERELY TO INCREASE THE EXTENT OF THEIR VOCABULARY WHICH MAY ALWAYS REMAIN CLUMSY IN THEIR HANDS WHEN BOOKISH SUBJECTS HAD BEEN EXCLUDED THE INSTRUCTOR URGED THE BOYS TO DESCRIBE SOME FAMILIAR OBJECTS OF THEIR DAILY LIFE OR TO NARRATE SOME EPISODES OF THEIR EXPERIENCE HIS ONLY CAUTION WAS  DONT WRITE ABOUT THINGS YOU HAVE READ OR HEARD HE WOULD NOT SELECT SUBJECTS FOR THEM FOR HE FOUND THAT THE NECESSITY OF CHOOSING SUBJECTS INCREASED AND SHARPENED THEIR POWERS OF OBSERVATION AT FIRST THEIR SUBJECTS WERE TOO LARGE TO BE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED OR NARRATED IN SUCH BRIEF COMPOSITIONS HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INSIST THAT THEY WRITE UP THE ADVENTURES OF A SINGLE HOUR OR LESS RATHER THAN OF A DAY IN TOWN OR A TRIP TO THE SHORE HE URGED THEM TO WRITE ABOUT THE MOSQUITO THAT BIT ME LAST NIGHT RATHER THAN ABOUT A TRIP TO THE ZOO TO WRITE ABOUT A HORSE SHYING AT A NEWSPAPER RATHER THAN A DESCRIP 637THE SCHOOL REVIEW TION OF THE WHOLE STREET ACUTENESS OF OBSERVATION AND ACCURACY OF DETAIL WERE EMPHASIZED THE ORDINARY SUBJECT OF MY WALK TO SCHOOL WAS SPLIT UP INTO A DOZEN SUBJECTS WHY I WALK TO SCHOOL THE MAN THAT SELLS PAPERS AT THE CORNER THE SCHOOLMATES I MEET THE BARKING DOG THE BABY THAT SMILED ALWAYS SOMETHING FORGOTTEN ETC MOST OF THE BOYS HAD NO TROUBLE IN GETTING SUBJECTS THEIR ADVENTURES DURING THE SUMMER WERE THE MAIN SUPPLY SOME FEW FELLOWS REPORTED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET SUBJECTS THAT THEIR EXPERIENCES HAD RUN OUT THE INSTRUCTOR WOULD THEREFORE QUESTION THEM ABOUT AS FOLLOWS SO NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO YOU WORTH WRITING ABOUT NOTHING THAT I CAN THINK OF HAVE YOU BEEN IN ANY FIGHTS LATELY NO IN ANY ACCI DENTS NO HAD ANY QUEER DREAMS NONE THAT I REMEMBER DID YOU EVER HIT YOUR THUMB NAIL WITH A HAMMER YES TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT WHY YOU WERE USING THE HAMMER HOW YOU CAME TO MAKE THE FALSE BLOW HOW YOUR NAIL FELT AND HOW LONG IT WAS SORE USUALLY A BOY WOULD REQUIRE SUCH HELP ONLY ONCE JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS THERE CAME A GENERAL COM PLAINT ABOUT THE SCARCITY OF SUBJECTS THE USUAL SUGGESTION WAS TELL ME WHY YOU RAN OUT OF SUBJECTS MANY COMPOSITIONS WERE WRITTEN ON THE DIFFICULTY OF CHOOSING A SUBJECT THE FOLLOWING WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED IS QUITE COMMON IN STYLE AND MATTER OH THAT ESSAY WELL IT IS SUNDAY NIGHT AND I HAVE NOTHING TO DO ONE WOULD NATURALLY THINK IF HE MET ANY NICE GIRLS THAT DAY BUT LIKE A FLASH 1 REMEMBER THAT I HAVE NOT WRITTEN THAT BOTHERSOME ESSAY I SEAT MYSELF TAKE UP A PEN AND GET A PIECE OF PAPER WONDERING WHAT THE NATURE OF MY ESSAY SHALL BE MY THOUGHTS GO IN VARIOUS CHANNELS AND THEN ENTIRELY OFF OF ESSAYS AND I THINK OF TRIGONOMETRY GERMAN AND SHORTHAND THEN I SUDDENLY REMEMBER THAT I FORGOT MY SHORTHAND EXERCISE THAT I WAS TO COPY AND WONDER WHAT MR C WILL SAY THEN I THINK OF THE PROFESSORS PRINCIPALLY MY TWO PARTICULAR FRIENDS MESSRS P AND H  AND THEN OF PROF M AND THERE MY MIND STAYS I CAN ALMOST SEE HIM NOW INSTRUCTING F IN HIS QUIET DIGNI FIED MANNER WHILE F LOOKS HARD AT HIS BOOK SCRATCHES HIS SHIN WITH HIS FOOT AND ABRUPTLY COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE DOES NOT HEAR ANYTHING THAT IS GOING ON BY JOVE HERE I AM THINKING OF EVERYTHING BUT THAT PLAGUED OLD ESSAY THE THOUGHT SO STARTLES ME THAT I BEGIN TO SHUFFLE MY BARE FEET 638BOYS IN COMPOSITION ONLY TO BANG MY BIG TOE WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE DESK THAT MAKES MY EYES WATER AND I MIGHT HAVE MADE THE AIR BLUE AS THE MAN DID THAT WENT THROUGH THE ROOM AT NIGHT AND CRACKED HIS SHINS AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BED BUT CONTROLLING MYSELF I PICK UP MY PEN AND START TO WRITE OH HOW LONG IT TAKES TO FINISH THAT ESSAY IALMOST COME TO THE CON CLUSION THAT I HAD BETTER GO TO BED BUT THE THOUGHT OF THE D DEFICIENT THAT I GOT IN LITERATURE LAST TERM WAS ENOUGH AND I MANAGED TO FINISH AND WITH A SMILE OF SATISFACTION WENT TO BED MANY OF THE BOYS CHOSE AS THEIR SUBJECTS ORDINARY DAILY EPI SODES AND FREQUENTLY THESE WERE INTENSELY INTERESTINGABOUT BOATING SWIMMING SAILING BASEBALL FOOTBALL WHENEVER THE SCHOOL ELEVEN WOULD WIN AT LEAST ONEFOURTH OF THE NEXT LOT OF COMPOSITIONS WOULD DESCRIBE THE GAME A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER ESSAYS WERE ON SUBJECTS SIMILAR TO THE FOLLOWING A TRIAL OF TOILETTISM HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A BIG HURRY AND IN COMPLETING YOUR TOILET GET STUCK ON YOUR COLLAR OR COLLARBUTTON  IF SO I KNOW I HAVE YOUR GREATEST SYMPATHY ONE EVENING I WAS IN MY ROOM HURRYING TO COMPLETE MY DRESSING AND EVERY NOW AND THEN REPLYING ALL RIGHT TO THE NUMEROUS PERSUASIONS TO HURRY UP ILL BE DOWN IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES SAID I TO THE IOTH ITS AFTER EIGHT OCLOCK AH THANK HEAVENS THAT IS DONE IT WAS THE COLLAR AND AFTER A BRIEF STRUGGLE I HAD IT ON SURVEYING MYSELF IN THE MIRROR I GAVE THE COLLAR A FEW TWITCHES AND PULLS IN ORDER TO STRAIGHTEN IT WHEN THE COLLARBUTTON BROKE OH FRANK DO HURRY UP WE ARE LATE NOW CALLS UP MOTHER ALL RIGHT ILL BE DOWN IN A FEW SECONDS GET MY HAT AND COAT READY THEN HURRYING TO THE NEXT ROOM I PULL OPEN MY BROTHERS DRAWER AND PLUNGING MY HAND INTO A NEAT PILE OF HANDKERCHIEFS NECKTIES AND SO FORTH I PULL OUT HIS GOLD BUTTON WHICH BELONGS TO THE SET HE RECEIVED FROM A PETTI COAT NOT THINKING ABOUT THIS OR THE CONSEQUENCES I STUCK IT IN MY SHIRT AND FASTENING ONE SIDE OF MY COLLAR I START ON THE OTHER WALKING UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR WITH THE PERSPIRATION ROLLING DOWN MY FACE I TRIED IN VAIN TO FASTEN THAT COLLAR THIS IS WHERE YOUR RELIGION FORSAKES YOU OR RATHER WE FOR SAKE OUR RELIGION AT LAST THE COLLAR IS FASTENED AND HEARING SOME ONE COMING UP THE STAIRS I HASTILY KNOT MY TIE JUST THEN BROTHER WALKS IN CALLING ME A LOBSTER LOAFER AND OTHER PET NAMES I NOW HAD ON MY VEST BUT SEEING MY BROTHER START TOWARDS HIS OPEN DRAWER I WAITED NO LONGER AND CATCHING UP MY COAT I WENT FOR THE STAIRS FALLING INTO IT ON THE WAY DOWN 639THE SCHOOL REVIEW OTHER BOYS WOULD WRITE OF IMAGINARY EXPERIENCES FANCIFUL ADVENTURES WITH THEIR LATEST GIRLS QUEER TRAMPS OUTLANDISH EXPLORATIONS RIDICULOUS DETECTIVE WORK IN FACT IT WOULD BE DIF FICULT TO DISCOVER A SUBJECT WHICH THEY HAD NOT TOUCHED FROM THE PALACES OF FAIRYLAND TO THE FURNACES OF HELL ONE OF THE VERY BEST COMPOSITIONS WAS WRITTEN BY A LITTLE IRISHMAN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS HE HAD NOT HANDED IN ANY COMPOSITIONS AND THE INSTRUCTOR REPRIMANDED HIM THE NEXT WEEK IN CAME A COM POSITION WHICH IN SUBSTANCE WAS AS FOLLOWS LAST NIGHT I DREAMED I WENT TO HELL AND WAS TRIED BY SATAN AND A JURY OF IMPS THEY ASKED ME ALL SORTS OF QUEER QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS I KNEW NOTHING OF AND FINALLY THE JURY LEFT THE ROOM BEFORE THIS I HAD FELT CALM AND WAS SATISFYING MY CURIOSITY BY GAZING AROUND THE WONDERFUL COURT ROOM NOW I BEGAN TO FEAR MY SENTENCE WOULD THEY SCORCH ME PLUCK OUT MY EYES STARVE ME KILL ME WITH THIRST HANG ME UP BY THE FEET AND BEAT MY SOLES TILL THE NAILS DROP  I CAN REMEMBER DISTINCTLY HOW THE DOOR CREAKED WHEN THEY ENTERED IN A MOMENT I WAS PRONOUNCED GUILTY SATAN SEEMED STARTLED FINALLY HE ROSE FROM THE BENCH WITH A LOOK OF PITY ON HIS FACE THAT FRIGHTENED ME MORE THAN HIS FORMER MALICIOUS LOOKS HE SAID AS I STOOD WITH QUAKING KNEES YOUNG MAN I PITY YOU ONLY FEW MORTALS HAVE I PITIED BUT FATE COMPELS ME TO SENTENCE YOU YOUNG MAN  I CONDEMN YOU  TO WRITE AN ESSAY THIS COMPOSITION GAVE THE HINT TO OTHER BOYS AND AMONG THE COMPOSITIONS OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK WAS THIS A TRIP TO THE CLOUDS IN THE AIR IT WAS THE SAME OLD QUESTION WHICH BOTHERS ME AND MANY OTHERS IN OUR SECTION WHAT SHALL I WRITE FOR A COMPOSITION THIS WEEK  AS I SAT IN THE REVOLVING CHAIR I TURNED THE THOUGHTS OVER IN MY MIND SUDDENLY THE CHAIR STARTED TO GO AROUND AT A GREAT RATE FASTER THAN A TOP GOES IT KEPT GOING AROUND AND UP THE CEILING AND ROOF WERE NO OBSTRUC TION TO IT AND I WAS SOON AMONG THE CLOUDS BEFORE I HAD TIME TO LOOK AROUND ME I WAS SEIZED BY A FLOCK OF GREAT BIRDS AND CARRIED TO A HOLLOW IN A BANK OF CLOUDS THE BIRDS HAD THE POWER OF SPEECH AND THE LEADER INFORMED ME THAT I WAS TO BE TRIED FOR INTRUDING ON THEIR DOMAINS THEY FORMED A COURT WITH THE LEADER AS JUDGE AFTER MUCH CHATTERING I WAS CONVICTED AND SENTENCED THE PENALTY WAS TO WRITE A COMPOSITION TO BE READ BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT I WAS DISMAYED TO SENTENCE ME SO HEAVILY FOR SUCH A SMALL OFFENSE WAS OUTRAGEOUS IF THEY HAD SENTENCED ME TO SHOVEL A FEW CLOUDS FROM THEIR FRONT DOOR I 640BOYS IN COMPOSITION WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT ANYTHING OF IT BUT TO WRITE A COMPOSITION THAT WAS AWFUL WELL SEEING THEY WERE NOT TO BE TURNED FROM THEIR PURPOSE I SAID I WOULD ATTEMPT IT I FOUND THAT I HAD NO INK THE LEADER SENT ONE OF THE BIRDS TO GET SOME AND HE RETURNED FROM THE EARTH WITH AN OYSTER SHELL FULL OF WATER FROM OUR CITY HYDRANT AS I HAD NO PEN ONE OF THE BIRDS PLUCKED A QUILL FROM HIS BODY AND GAVE IT TO ME I HAD SOME OLD SCRAPS OF PAPER IN MY POCKET AND STARTED TO WRITE ON THEM I HAD JUST FINISHED ABOUT TWO WORDS WHEN A GUST OF WIND BLEW THE PAPER AWAY I TRIED TO SNATCH IT BUT I FELL OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLOUD AND INTO SPACE I LANDED ON MY BACK AND AWOKE TO FIND THAT I HAD TURNED THE CHAIR UP TOO FAR AND IT HAD FALLEN OVER AND LANDED ME ON MY BACK RARELY HOWEVER WAS THE INSTRUCTOR WEARIED WITH MANY COM POSITIONS ON THE SAME SUBJECT WHEN SOME EVENT OF SCHOOL IMPORTANCE HAD INTERESTED ALL THE STUDENTS THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPOSITIONS WERE UPON IT THE MOST WEARISOME LOT OF COMPO SITIONS CAME TO HIM ONE BRIGHT MORNING IN MAY HE HAD EXCUSED THE CLASS FROM HANDING IN COMPOSITIONS DURING THAT MONTH BUT TWICE HE GAVE THEM SUBJECTS TO WRITE UP DURING THE RECITATION HOUR ONE BEAUTIFUL MAY MORNING WHEN ALL THE WORLD EVEN THE BUSY CITY SEEMED TO HIM TO BE HAPPY AND HE HOPED THE BOYS TOO WERE HAPPY HE TRIED TO GIVE THEM THE LEAST WEARYING SUBJECT SO HE ASKED THEM TO WRITE ABOUT THE MOST PLEASANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE THE NEXT MORNING WHICH WAS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AND BRIGHT UPON EXAMINING THEM HE WAS ASTONISHED AND OVER POWERED TO FIND THAT NINETENTHS OF THE COMPOSITIONS WERE ON A DAY AT THE SHORE HE PLANNED REVENGE ONE WEEK LATER HE GAVE THE CLASS THE SUBJECT THE HARDEST THING I EVER DID AT THE END OF THE HOUR HE RECEIVED 218 COMPOSITIONS AND EVERY ONE WAS FAR ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN WORTH HE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT PLEASURE IS VAGUE BUT PAIN DEFINITE NO TWO OF THESE COMPOSITIONS WERE ALIKE IN STYLE OR TREAT MENT ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM WERE ON THE SAME SUBJECTS FOR INSTANCE THIRTYTHREE BOYS WROTE OF ADVENTURES AND WORK ON FARMS NINETEEN ON ROWING EIGHTEEN ON COMPOSITIONWRITING HOWEVER SEVENTYTWO SEPARATE SUBJECTS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED TWO BOYS WHO DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER AND WHO COULD NOT HAVE COMMUNICATED STARTED THEIR COMPOSITIONS WITH THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT THE HARDEST THING I EVER DID WAS TO ACT AS PALL 641THE SCHOOL REVIEW BEARER AT MY GRANDMOTHERS FUNERAL FOR SHE WAS SO HEAVY ONE LITTLE HEBREW WROTE THAT THE HARDEST THING HE EVER DID WAS TO LOSE A QUARTER WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD GIVEN HIM IN HIS GLEE HE TOSSED IT UP IN THE KITCHEN BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT HIT THE CEILING AND BOUNCED OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO A PILE OF LOGS HE WORKED HARD UNTIL HE PULLED THE LOGS OFF BUT EVEN THEN HE COULD NOT FIND THE MONEY IN THE CHIPS PIECES OF BARK AND MOLD SO HE CAME INTO THE KITCHEN AND BEGAN TO CRY BUT HIS MOTHER GAVE HIM ANOTHER QUARTER A SMALL REDHEADED BASHFUL BOY SURPRISED THE INSTRUCTOR VERY MUCH BY SAYING THAT THE HARDEST THING HE EVER DID WAS TRYING TO TEACH A GIRL TO SWIM SHE WOULD NOT WET HER BATHING SUIT ANOTHER BEAU COULD REMEMBER NOTHING HARDER THAN WAITING FOR HIS GIRL TO COME DOWN TO THE PARLOR ANOTHER THOUGHT THE HARDEST THING WAS TO STAY AWAY FROM THE THEATER TO STUDY HIS FRIEND HOWEVER SAID IT WAS HARDER TO HAVE TO STUDY AFTER COMING HOME FROM THE PLAY THE COMPOSITIONS COULD BE ROUGHLY CLASSIFIED INTO SIX GROUPS IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT JUST BEFORE THE FINAL EXAMINATIONS ONE THIRD OF THE CLASS OR SEVENTYFIVE BOYS SHOULD BE WORRYING OVER SCHOOL WORK ONLY ONESIXTH OF THE CLASS OR THIRTYSEVEN BOYS WROTE ABOUT SPORTS PROBABLY BECAUSE THOUGH SOME SPORTS ARE PAINFUL YET THEIR LABOR DELIGHT IN THEM SETS OFF AT FIRST GLANCE IT WAS ASTONISHING TO FIND THAT ONESEVENTH OF THE CLASS OF CITY BOYS OR THIRTYTHREE WROTE ON FARM WORK THE TRUTH IS THAT MANY OF THE SCHOOLBOYS SPEND THEIR SUMMERS ON FARMS WHERE THEY ATTEMPT TO PERFORM CERTAIN MANUAL TASKS FOR WHICH THEIR PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND TRAINING ARE INADEQUATE TWENTYTWO WORKED IN STORES DURING THE SUMMER AND COMPLAINED OF THE CON FINEMENT ON THE HOT DAYS WHEN THEY WISHED TO LOAF IN THE PARK OR TO GO SWIMMING TWENTYSIX BOYS THOUGHT THE HARDEST WORK OF THEIR LIVES WAS ABOUT THE HOUSE PUTTING UP AWNINGS BEATING CARPETS AND SO FORTH ONLY FOURTEEN WERE SO MUCH INTERESTED IN THEMSELVES THAT THEY WROTE OF THEIR PERSONAL HABITS SUCH AS GETTING AWAKE IN THE MORNING BEING PROMPT AT MEALS THE REMAINING ELEVEN COMPOSITIONS COULD NOT BE CLASSIFIED RANGING IN SUBJECTS FROM KILLING A DOG TO SINGING A SOLO UPON A SIMILAR OCCASION THE INSTRUCTOR ASKED A CLASS OF THIRTY 642BOYS IN COMPOSITION EIGHT BOYS TO WRITE A COMPLAINT ABOUT SOMETHING IN CONNECTION WITH THE SCHOOL TO GIVE THEIR REASONS AND TO SUGGEST REMEDIES TWENTY DIFFERENT GRIEVANCES WERE SUPPORTED BY SUCH GOOD REASONS THAT FOURTEEN OF THEM HAVE SINCE BEEN REDRESSED BY FACULTY ACTION AND THREE MORE ARE NOW AWAITING CONSIDERATION THE METHOD OF CORRECTING AND CRITICISING THE COMPOSITIONS VARIED ACCORDING TO THE SIZE OF THE CLASS A SMALL CLASS OF TWENTYFIVE WAS MOST SATISFACTORY TO WORK WITH EACH MONDAY MORNING THEIR COMPOSITIONS WERE COLLECTED AND ON THE LAST HOUR ON FRIDAY WHEN ALL OF THE BOYS WERE TIRED OF THE ORDINARY ROUTINE THEY CAME TO THE INSTRUCTOR AND HE READ THE COMPOSITIONS ALOUD TO THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IN THIS HOUR HE ATTEMPTED TO LESSEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN STUDENTS AND TEACHER BY URGING THEM TO CRITICISE AND COMMENT UPON THE COMPOSITIONS THEMSELVES FOR THE FIRST THREE WEEKS THE CLASS MADE FEW CRITI CISMS THE INSTRUCTOR THEN BEGAN TO READ OUT FAULTY SENTENCES AND ASK PARTICULAR BOYS TO CRITICISE THEM SOON THE BETTER PART OF THE CRITICISMS CAME FROM THE CLASS IF AN INTERESTING COMPO SITION WAS READ THEY WOULD LISTEN QUIETLY WITHOUT COMMENT IF THE SUBJECT WAS OLD AND FAMILIAR WITHOUT ANY NOVEL REDEEMING FEATURES THEY WOULD CALL OUT CHESTNUT OH GIVE US A REST IF AN INVOLVED SENTENCE WAS READ THE CRY WAS GUIDE WANTED IF THE SENTENCES WERE INCORRECT GRAMMATICALLY THEY WOULD CALL OH WHAT ARE YOU GIVING US IF THE WRONG WORD WAS USED THE CORRECT ONE WOULD BE SUGGESTED IF THE TREATMENT OF THE SUBJECT WAS DRY AND UNINTERESTING THE BOYS WOULD GROAN PRETEND TO SNORE CALL OH MY WAKE ME UP IF THE COMPOSITION WAS MONOTONOUSLY LONG THEIR COMMENT WAS CUT IT OFF IF TOO MANY THINGS WERE DISCUSSED THEY SAID GOOD FOR THREE DONT BE SO EXTRAVAGANT MEANING OF COURSE THAT THERE WAS MATERIAL FOR THREE COMPOSITIONS THE INSTRUCTOR REALIZED THAT HE MIGHT BE CRITICISED FOR PER MITTING THE USE OF SLANG IN CLASS WORK THE REMARKS OF THE BOYS MAY BE REGARDED AS INANE EFFORTS AT A SICKLY SORT OF HUMOR INSTEAD OF A SINCERE ATTEMPT TO POINT OUT MISTAKES FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CONCERNED NOT WILLING TO DECIDE THE MATTER BY THEORY HE PERMITTED THIS CLASS TO CONTINUE ITS COMMENTS IN ITS OWN 643THE SCHOOL REVIEW PHRASES BUT ANOTHER CLASS WAS REQUIRED TO EXPRESS ITS CRITICISMS IN STANDARD ENGLISH WITHOUT SLANG AFTER ONE MONTH HE ALLOWED BOTH CLASSES TO USE LEGITIMATE SLANG FOR HE FOUND THAT IN THIS WAY ONLY WOULD THE CLASS KEEP UP A SPONTANEOUS INTERESTING CRITICISM OF COURSE SLANG PHRASES OF UNUSUAL VAGUENESS AND INDELICACY WERE EXCLUDED HE TRIED TO POINT OUT THE LEGITIMATE USE OF SLANG AND REQUIRED THE BOYS IN THEIR COMPOSITIONS TO DISTINGUISH ALL THE SLANG PHRASES USED BY INCLOSING THEM IN QUOTATION MARKS BUT NOT MORE THAN ONE COMPOSITION IN A HUN DRED CONTAINED SLANG IN THE EXAMINATION PAPERS OF THE COURSES IN LITERATURE HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT SLANG EVEN WHEN APPROPRIATE FOR INSTANCE IN A TEST ON BYRONS CHILDE HAROLD HE ASKED DO YOU LIKE ONE CANTO MORE THAN THE OTHERS IF SO WHY SOME OF THE BOYS PREFERRED THE FIRST CANTO BECAUSE OF THE BULL FIGHT OTHERS PREFERRED THE THIRD BECAUSE OF THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AND A FEW PREFERRED THE FOURTH BECAUSE IT WAS THE LAST THE INSTRUCTOR WAS COMPELLED TO MARK ONLY ONE ANSWER DEFICIENT AND THAT WAS ALL COONS LOOK ALIKE TO ME IT BECAME CLEAR THEREFORE THAT TO GAIN THE BEST RESULTS IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE THE BOYS PARTICIPATION IN THE CRITICISM WHILE THE BOYS MIGHT BE INDIFFERENT TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE INSTRUCTOR THEY WERE ALWAYS OBLIGED TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE CLASS A BOY WOULD RARELY REPEAT A FAULT WHICH THE CLASS HAD CRITICISED A FRIENDLY RIVALRY WAS CREATED THE BOY WHO HAD BEEN CRITICISED WATCHED CLOSELY TO DETECT FAULTS IN THE WORK OF HIS CRITICS CONSEQUENTLY THE ENTIRE CLASS WAS ALERT AND INTERESTED AND THE FEW COMMENTS WHICH THE TEACHER INTERJECTED FELL ON OPEN EARS HOWEVER THE CLASS LEFT LITTLE FOR HIM TO COMMENT UPON EXCEPT SPELLING PUNCTUATION AND NEATNESS WHILE INDIVIDUAL BOYS MIGHT GIVE FAULTY AND INCOMPLETE CRITICISMS THE CRITICISM OF THE WHOLE CLASS WAS USUALLY VERY ACCURATE AND THOR OUGH IN THIS HOUR THE INSTRUCTOR BECAME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HIS CLASS THAN IN THE OTHER FOUR HOURS OF HIS WORK WITH IT DURING THE WEEK IT WAS ALSORESTFUL AND ENTERTAINING ONLY ONCE WAS HE COMPELLED TO RESORT TO DISCIPLINARY MEASURES TO KEEP ORDER IN THE ROOM SEVERAL TIMES HE WAS VERY MUCH AMUSED AT THE PER SONAL CRITICISM CONTAINED IN THE COMPOSITIONS ONCE IN PAR 644BO YS IN COMPOSITION TICULAR AS HE WAS READING THEM ALOUD IN REGULAR ORDER HE WAS ASTONISHED TO READ AS THE FIRST SENTENCE WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IF A YOUNG RATTLEBRAINED COLLEGE GRADUATE CAME TO YOUR SCHOOL AND MADE YOU WRITE AN ESSAY EACH WEEK  NATURALLY THIS TOOK HIS BREATH HE CHECKED HIS FIRST IMPULSE TO LAUGH FOR HE WON DERED WHETHER SUCH A BREACH OF DECORUM WOULD RUIN THE DIS CIPLINE OF THE CLASS YET IT WAS TOO GOOD TO STAND PUNISHMENT WITHOUT RAISING HIS EYES HE READ THE SENTENCE ALOUD AGAIN SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY AFTER A PAUSE HE TOOK HIS GLASSES OUT OF THEIR CASE RUBBED THEM CAREFULLY AND PUTTING THEM ON READ THE SEN TENCE A THIRD TIME ALL THIS TIME THERE WAS ABSOLUTE QUIET IN THE ROOM THE ASTHMATIC BREATHING OF A BOY ON THE SECOND ROW WAS THE ONLY SOUND THEN THE INSTRUCTOR LOOKED UP SLOWLY FROM THE PAPER AND DELIBERATELY STARED AT THE WRITER WHO SAT A FEW SEATS AWAY MUCH EMBARRASSED AND FRIGHTENED AFTER A LONG STARE THE INSTRUCTOR QUIETLY WINKED AT THE BOY AND THEN SMILED A LAUGH OF RELIEF BROKE FROM THE CLASS THEREAFTER THAT CLASS WAS THE BESTBEHAVED CLASS THAT CAME TO HIM FOR LARGER CLASSES THE METHOD WAS VERY DIFFERENT FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS THE INSTRUCTOR WOULD READ COMPOSITIONS ALOUD AND CRITICISE THEM AS HE READ TO THE WHOLE CLASS SOMETIMES THE BOYS READ THEIR OWN COMPOSITIONS ALOUD WITH A CLASS OF ONE HUNDRED BOYS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ ALL THE COMPOSITIONS DURING THE HOUR WITH SUCH LARGE CLASSES HIS METHOD WAS TO WAIT UNTIL EACH BOY HAD HANDED IN FOUR COMPOSITIONS THEN THE INSTRUCTOR WOULD CALL UP TO HIS DESK THE FIRST BOY IN THE CLASS AND LOOK OVER ALL FOUR OF HIS COMPOSITIONS PAYING STRICT ATTENTION TO THE ERRORS COMMON TO ALL MEANTIME THE SECOND BOY HAD TAKEN HIS COMPOSITIONS FROM THE DRAWER UNFOLDED THEM AND ARRANGED THEM IN REGULAR ORDER SO THAT ALL OF THE INSTRUCTORS TIME MIGHT BE GIVEN TO CRITICISM IN THIS WAY EACH BOY RECEIVED A PERSONAL CRITICISM OF ALL HIS COMPOSITIONS ONCE A MONTH FOR THE INSTRUCTOR COULD READ AND GRADE FOUR COMPOSITIONS OF ONE BOY IN THE TIME IT TOOK FOR TWO COMPOSITIONS OF SEPARATE BOYS IN FACT THIS WAS THE ONLY METHOD BY WHICH IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO CRITICISE AND GRADE THE WEEKLY COMPOSITIONS OF A CLASS OF THREE HUNDRED BOYS WHOM HE MET IN SECTIONS OF ONE HUNDRED ONLY ONE HOUR A WEEK 645THE SCHOOL REVIEW ONCE AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE SCHOOL HE TRIED TO LIGHTEN THE WORK BY CORRECTING ONLY EVERY FIFTH COMPOSITION OF EACH BOY THE BOYS SOON LOST INTEREST THEY WISHED TO KNOW HOW THEY WERE DOING TO SEE THEIR MISTAKES AT LAST IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SOME OF THE BOYS WERE COPYING OVER AND HANDING IN OLD COMPOSITIONS THEY NEEDED TO KNOW THAT EVERY BIT OF THEIR WORK WAS EXAMINED IT WAS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THE BOYS MIGHT CORRECT EACH OTHERS WORK THIS WAS FOUND IMPRACTICABLE BECAUSE THE BOYS WERE NOT SKILLED ENOUGH IN DETECTING ERRORS WHEN WORKING ALONE AND BECAUSE IT CAUSED TOO MUCH COMMOTION BESIDES TO GRADE THE PAPERS THEY HAD TO BE GONE OVER AGAIN BY THE INSTRUCTOR SUCH A METHOD MOREOVER SEEMED WRONG IN PRINCIPLE FOR STU DENTS SHOULD BE PREVENTED NOT ONLY FROM MAKING ERRORS BUT FROM SEEING THEM CONSTANT READING OF MISTAKES LEADS TO MAKING MISTAKES AS THE INSTRUCTOR LEARNED TO HIS REGRET WITH THESE LARGE SECTIONS HIS WORK WAS PERSONALLY DISCOUR AGING AND EXHAUSTING FOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO COME INTO AS CLOSE CONTACT WITH EACH BOY AS WORK IN COMPOSITION DEMANDS FOR LECTURES ON LITERARY MOVEMENTS AND THE LIVES OF AUTHORS AND READ INGS FROM THEIR WORKS SMALL SECTIONS MAY BE PROFITABLY COMBINED INTO A LARGE CLASS BUT FOR COMPOSITION WORK LARGE CLASSES SHOULD BE SPLIT UP INTO SMALL SECTIONS FOR THE DETAILED INDIVIDUAL WORK WHICH HAS PROVED BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE JAMES HUGH MOFFATT THE CENTRAL HIGH

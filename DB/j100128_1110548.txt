j100128,Columbia Law Review,1110548,Liability in Tort of Carriers of the Mail,i246319,LIABILITY IN TORT OF CARRIERS OF THE MAIL The question as to the right of the owner of a parcel consigned to the mail to recover in tort for its loss or destruction as against the carrier of such mail by contract whose servant has by negli gence or misfeasance occasioned such loss has only recently been directly passed upon by the courts1 Certain difficulties with which the courts seem to have been confronted in reaching their con clusions in these cases and certain other difficulties which are likely to arise in applying the decisions announced suggest a brief examination of the course of the decisions relating to the liability of postmasters and others who are engaged in discharging the functions assumed by the government in maintaining a postoffice department The history of the postmasters liability begins with the discus sion in the case of Lane v Cotton2 in which the views of the judges of the court of Kings Bench were fully expressed although judgment for the defendants was not entered until a year later The case was briefly as follows The plaintiff Lane having entrusted to the postoffice at London a letter containing two exchequer bills of three hundred pounds each addressed to one Jones at Worcester alleged that this letter with the bills contained therein was not conveyed to Worcester but was lost by the negli gence of the defendants Sir Robert Cotton and Sir Thomas Frank land who had been appointed jointly as postmastersgeneral of England and their servants There were special findings in the case in favor of the plaintiff on these allegations It appeared that the letter was delivered at the London postoffice to one Breese who had been appointed by the defendants to receive the letters at that office and it is plain from the opinions of the justices that if there was any negligence it was that of Breese who was appointed by the postmastersgeneral under authority of the statute to discharge the duties which he was performing in con nection with the receipt and custody of the letter The question submitted to the court was whether the action would lie against Bankers Mutual Casualty Co v Minneapolis etc Ry C C A I902 117 Fed 434 54 C C A 6o8 and Boston Ins Co v C R I  P Ry I902 II8 Iowa 423 2I70I I Ld Raym 646 also reported at length in 12 Mod 472 and briefly in other reportsLIABILITY OF CARRIERS OF THE MAIL 633 the postmastersgeneral for the neglect and nonfeasance of Breese The case was tried before Chief Justice Holt who reached the conclusion that the defendants were liable for the negligence of Breese who might also be liable not only as an officer but as a wrongdoer On a reargument before four justices of the Kings Bench three of them were of opinion that the defendants were not liable for the negligence of Breese but Chief Justice Holt adhered to his original view as to the defendants liability Sub sequently a judgment was rendered for the defendants but it is said that upon an intimation that the plaintiff intended to bring a writ of error on the judgment the defendants paid the plain tiffs claim The arguments for plaintiff and defendants and the views expressed by the justices are so pertinent to the question as to the liability in tort of a carrier of the mails that it will be inter esting briefly to summarize them8 For the plaintiff it was con tended that the office of postmaster was an ancient common law office exercisable by any person before the enactment of the Statute of 12 Car II c 35 which created the office of postmaster general with the purpose of making one public office of all the prior private ones the end proposed being a more speedy and safe conveyance of letters Therefore the posts whether private or public should be considered as common carriers of small packets and consequently liable as are other common carriers to make satisfaction for miscarriage It was further contended that the postmastergeneral appointed under the Statute was charged with the duty of carrying letters consigned to post and was an swerable for his subordinates whom he was authorized to appoint and that although in the letters patent issued to the postmaster general there was a covenant that he should not answer for the default of any other person nevertheless such letters patent con stituted only a private agreement between the King and his appointee which agreement could not deprive the subject of a benefit which was given to him by law reference being made to the liability of a sheriff for the negligence of his bailiff For the defendants it was contended that the liability arising out of com mon law offices was not applicable to this public office created by statute the smallness of the premium paid for the transportation The arguments of counsel pro and con are more fully stated in the report of the case in 12 Mod 472 than in the report given in i Ld Raym 646 but the latter report gives more specifically the views of the Justices and especially the views of Chief Justice Holt dissentingCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW of letters and parcels being relied upon as an argument that Parlia ment in the enactment of the Statute did not have in contempla tion any such liability of the postmastergeneral therein provided for It was further contended that there was no analogy between the postmastergeneral and a common carrier as the latter had the privilege of making his own price according to the risk run whereas the rate for the carriage of letters and parcels by post was fixed by statute The controversy as to whether the exchequer bills were within the contemplation of the Statute which provided for the carrying by post of all letters and and packages whatso ever need not be stated for on this question the justices were equally divided Gould Justice based his conclusion that the defendants were not liable especially on the ground that Breese was as much a Kings officer as were the defendants although the defendants were more general officers and that each was bound only to answer for himself He suggested moreover that if the defend ants had died yet Breese would have continued as officer and therefore Breese had a charge and trust of himself and was not a deputy to the defendants He also laid stress on the nature of the office as indicated by the general purpose of the Statute and insisted that since the defendants received only a salary there was no adequate recompense to find a contract rendering the post mastersgeneral liable for the value of the letters or parcels re ceivedthere being no proportion between the compensation and the hazard Powys Justice agreed that if such an office had been erected at common law by a private man for gain an action would have lain at common law for a miscarriage but he observed that Parlia ment in setting the price for carriage had regard only to the size and weight and not to the value from which he inferred that Parliament did not intend that the postmastergeneral should be answerable for the value of packages lost in the post But he thought that an action would lie against Breese who had received the letter on the theory that the inferior officers were servants of the King and not of the defendants their wages being paid out of the returns of the postoffice and security being taken of them in the name of the King He believed however that it would be otherwise if the office had been farmed Turton Justice made the rather irrelevant suggestion that an action would not lie against the custodian of records for so negli 634LIABILITY OF CARRIERS OF THE MAIL 635 gently keeping such records that a record was lost because other clerks beside his had access to the office but he agreed in general with Gould and Powys Chief Justice Holts dissent was stated at great length He not only undertook to answer the objections of the other justices to the right of recovery by the plaintiff but discussed seriatim various other objections no doubt for the purpose of meeting the arguments of defendants counsel His main points however may be suffi ciently summarized for present purposes as follows First the post mastergeneral is by the Statute intrusted with the interest and property of the subject and charged with the duty of safely keep ing at his peril all letters confided to his custody and the Chief Justice urge the analogy of the marshal or warden of a prison who is obliged safely to keep the prisoners at his peril Second the owner of the letter pays a premium for its carriage in pur suance of an employment which the postmastergeneral has accepted and to the objection that the office was founded by the government he answered that it was immaterial whether it was founded by the statute law or the common law As to the objec tion that the charge ought to be in pursuance of some sort of con tract he denied that any contract was necessary considering the duty of the office in itself sufficient to impose the obligation and he further contended that the defendants received a salary and the case was therefore like that of the master of a ship accepting goods for transportation and analogous to that of an innkeeper who is chargeable for goods in his custody His main contention however was that Breese had been appointed by the defendants and was removable by them though they did not pay him his wages But on the other hand if Breese was not a servant of the defendants the defendants were still liable for his wrong as that of a stranger for whose acts they had assumed liability by undertaking the duties of their office The case of Lane v Cotton then stands for the proposition that the postmastergeneral of England and by necessary applica tion of the line of reasoning any postmaster is a public officer not accountable for the misconduct of subordinates who though they may be appointed by him are officers of the postal department This proposition was reannounced seventyfive years later in the case of Whitfield v Lord Le Despencer in which the plaintiff sought to recover against the postmastersgeneral of England the 1778 2 Cowp 754COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW value of a banknote for one hundred pounds which he had sent in a letter lost in the mail There was a special finding that plaintiffs letter was delivered into the general postoffice in London and with the banknote enclosed came to the hands of one Michell a sorter of letters appointed by defendants and paid out of the revenues of the office who had given security and taken an oath for the faithful discharge of his duties and that the said Michell feloniously secreted plaintiffs letter and stole the banknote there from for which offense he was tried convicted and executed The question most elaborately argued was as to whether Michell was the servant of the public that is an officer of the department or whether he was the servant of the defendants Lord Mans field delivering the opinion of the court reexamined the question as to the state of the law prior to the decision of the case of Lane v Cotton and reached the conclusion that from the nature of his employment Michell was a public servant for whose mis conduct the defendants were not liable He was satisfied there fore to render a judgment for the defendants on the authority of Lane v Cotton which he said had been acted upon as law by Parliament the postoffice department and the people The de cision might well have been rested however upon the language of a statute passed after the decision in Lane v Cotton embodying the exemption from liability of the postmastergeneral which in the case of Lord Cotton and his associate was embodied only in the patent to the office The distinction between the rule of liability of a public officer for the misconduct of subordinate officers and that of a corporate body for the misconduct of its servants was pointed out in the case of The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board Trustees v Gibbs5 in which the cases of Lane v Cotton and Whitfield v Lord Le Despencer were commented upon In this case it appeared that the defendants plaintiffs in error were incorporated by act of Parliament for the purpose of maintaining certain public docks and that plaintiffs vessel was by reason of a mud bank injured in approaching such docks It was not contended that the trustees personally had knowledge of the unfit condition of the approach to the docks but it was insisted that they were charged with such knowledge through their servants and were therefore liable for failure to take reasonable care that the entrance to the docks should be kept in a safe condition for use On an appeal by the trustees 1I864 L R I H L 93 636LIABILITY OF CARRIERS OF THE MAIL 637 from a judgment in which they were held liable for the damages suffered by the plaintiff the judges ruled that the trustees were not public officers but constituted in effect a public corporation charged with a duty involving a liability for the negligent mainte nance of these public works The cases as to the postmasters general were distinguished on the ground that the latter were public officers servants of the government entrusted with the management of a branch of the government business and not responsible for the negligence or default of those in the same public employment as themselves Finally the cases as to the liability of the postmastersgeneral were followed in Bainbridge v PostmasterGeneral6 which was an action for personal injuries received in consequence of the negligent displacement of a footway for the purpose of repairing a telegraph cable The negligence was that of an engineer em ployed by the postoffice department in its function of maintaining the postal telegraph line and the attempt to distinguish the early postmastergeneral cases was based on the contention that the statute establishing the postal telegraph conferred upon the post mastergeneral a corporate function instead of an official duty with reference to the business transferred to him This contention was denied and the exemption of the defendant from liability was based on the conclusion that the functions of the postmastergeneral as to the public telegraph were analogous to those which he exer cised with reference to the mail service The doctrine of the cases above noticed has been uniformly followed in this country with the result that any officer of the postoffice department whether superior or inferior is liable to the owner of mailmatter for injury due to his own personal default in the discharge of his duties but not liable for the default of a subordinate officer or servant in the public employment Thus in Keenant v Southworth7 a postmaster was held not liable to the sender of a letter for its loss by the negligence of a clerk in his office the brief statement being that the postmastergeneral the deputy postmasters and their assistants and clerks appointed and sworn as required by law are public officers each of whom is responsible for his own negligence only and not for that of any of the others although selected by him and subject to his orders i9o6 i K B 178 C A I905 1872 IIo Mass 474COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW In Raisler v Oliver8 the same proposition is announced but with the limitation that it is applicable for the exemption of a postmaster from liability for the defaults of his clerks and assistants only where they are appointed in pursuance of some law expressly authorizing it so that by virtue of the law and the appointment the appointees become in some sort public officers themselves Under this qualification the court sustained a judgment against the defendant postmaster on the ground that it did not appear in the record that the clerk whose negligence caused the loss of registered letters was an employee of the department rather than a private clerk or assistant paid by the postmaster out of his own salary or means These cases have been discussed at some length for the pur pose of making clear a distinction which must be taken between the case of a postmaster sought to be charged for the default of a subordinate in the public service though appointed by him and the case of a carrier of mail under contract sought to be charged for the results of the negligence of a servant who is not in any way accepted by the postoffice department or recognized as being in the service of that department The failure to make such distinction misled the Supreme Court of Ohio in Conwell v Voorhees9 into holding that the owners and proprietors of a stage coach who had contracted for the carriage of United States mail were not liable to the owner for loss of a letter containing money on the ground that such contractors were public agents not responsible for the omissions negligence or misfea sance of those employed under them and having employed trust worthy persons of suitable skill and ability they had not cooperated in the wrong This case was followed in Hutchins v Brackett0 in which it was assumed that the English postmaster cases were controlling but the point was not really involved for it appeared that the servant who lost the letter was in fact a mailcarrier pre sumptively as it would seem recognized by the postoffice depart ment as a proper person to carry the mail under its authority These two cases however were criticised and their defective reasoning pointed out in Sawyer v Corse which involved the liability of a contractor carrying the mail for loss of a letter 1892 97 Ala 710 9I844 I3 Ohio 523 1oi85o 22 N H 252 Va I867 17 Gratt 230 638LIABILITY OF CARRIERS OF THE MAIL 639 containing banknotes due to the negligence of his private agent or servant it appearing that such servant was selected employed and paid by the contractor was under his direction and control worked for his benefit and profit and could be discharged by him at pleasure The court reasoned that though the contractor may be said to be in a certain sense an agent of the government because he is engaged in working for the government yet the laborers and others whom he employs under him in the execution of his con tract cannot be said to be agents of the government which does not know them does not appoint them does not control them does not pay them and has nothing to do with them The Supreme Court of Mississippi in Foster v Metts12 very clearly misconceived the distinction made in the case of Sawyer v Corse between the private servant of a contractor and a sub ordinate in the governments employ for it expressed its disap proval of the latter case favoring the views expressed in Conwell v Voorhees and Hutchins v Brackett although the facts under consideration involved the liability of a contractor for loss of a letter stolen by a government mailcarrier at least that is the inference suggested by the statement of the court that a carrier of the mails is required to be of a certain age take a certain oath etc and is subject to discharge by any postmaster under certain contingencies Such a carrier is of course a subordinate agent of the government whose employment is contemplated and provided for by the government in contracting to have the mail carried and the rule that postmasters are not liable for defaults of their subordinates was therefore applicable Apparently the first case of a suit involving the liability of a railroad company as a carrier of mail to the owner of mailmat ter for its loss or destruction due to the negligence of the servants of the company is that of Central R  B Co v Lampleyl3 decided by the Supreme Court of Alabama The plaintiff Lamp ley sued the defendant company to recover damages for the alleged conversion of 225 in money which the plaintiff had sent by mail enclosed in a registered letter which had never reached its destination It appeared that the pouch containing the letter was strapped and locked by the postmaster and delivered to an employee of the defendant the custom of the postoffice at that time being to deliver mail pouches to and receive them from the I877 55 Miss 77 1884 76 AIa 357COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW employees of the defendant It is clear from the testimony that this employee was merely a trainhand or porter and that the mail while being carried on defendants train was not in charge of any route agent or official of the postoffice department the pouches being placed in the baggagecar The conductor who seems to have been the only person on the train charged with any duty regarding the mail pouches was not a postal official Judg ment having been rendered against the railroad company for the loss of the money in the registered letter the Supreme Court on appeal held that the action for conversion would not lie and reversed the judgment saying that there was no evidence tending to show that the defendant was guilty of any wrongful disposi tion or appropriation or withholding of the letter other than the failure to deliver on the commencement of the suit On the gen eral proposition as to whether the defendant would be liable for loss of the letter by the negligence or want of care of defendants servants the court approved of the doctrine announced in Sawyer v Corse on the theory that the employees of the railroad are its private servants not engaged in the government employment and it noticed with disapproval the cases of Conwell v Voorhees and Hutchins v Brackett which have already been commented upon There was also some consideration in this case of the question whether the railroad company was with regard to the mail thus carried a common carrier of goods and the suggestion was made that its liability in this respect was only that of bailee for hire Following the chronological order of decisions as well as relevancy of subject matter we must next consider the English case of The Winkfield14 A collision occurred between the steam ship Mexican carrying the British mails for South Africa and the steamship Winkfield resulting in the loss of the former with a portion of the mail which she was carrying In proceed ings in the Admiralty Court to determine the liability of the owners of the Winkfield for the damages sustained by the Mexican and all other claims for damages resulting from the collision the court allowed claims of the postmastergeneral of England for the value of letters and parcels in respect of which the parties interested had made claims upon him and given him written authority to represent them in these proceedings but it refused to allow his claim for letters and parcels in respect of which no claims had been made or instructions received from the senders 1902 P 42 C A I9o0 640LIABILITY OF CARRIERS OF THE MAIL 641 or addressees although the postmastergeneral undertook to dis tribute the proceeds among them On appeal from the disallow ance of the latter claims it was held in the Court of Appeals that the postmastergeneral stood in the position of bailee for the owners of letters and parcels sent by the mail and as such bailee was entitled to recover the value of property lost through the negligence of the defendants thus overruling the case of Claridge v South Staffordshire Tramway Co15 in which it was held that as against a wrongdoer the bailee could only recover the damage to his interest in the property leaving the bailor to sue for his own loss The court discussed at length the nature of the bailees right in the property intrusted to him and reached the conclusion that his right to recover for its loss or injury did not rest upon his liability over to the bailor but upon his possessionthe duty to account to the bailor for the amount of the recovery over and above the value of his own interest as a bailee being a consequence of his having acquired a claim which was in his hands a substi tute for the lost property The significance of this decision so far as it relates to mailmatter is that as to such matter the postoffice department stands toward the owner as bailee authorized to con tract with reference to its transportation and on behalf of its owner to recover damages from any person who either by breach of contract or by tort has caused an injury to such owner Under this theory a contractor for the carriage of mail to whom mail matter is delivered for transportationfull custody and posses sion of the matter being given to the carrier and not to a servant of the department accompanying it during the transportation is a bailee of the department and liable to respond to the depart ment not only for breach of contract of transportation but also in tort for negligence resulting in damage or loss It is quite true as was suggested in Foster v Metts and Cetntral R  B Co v Lampley supra that a carrier of mail although engaged otherwise in the business of common carrier is not a common carrier as to the mail he transports but only a private carrier subject to the liability involved in that form of bailment for the carriage of the mail is not one of the functions which a public carrier of goods holds himself out to perform It is equally true as suggested in those cases that there is no privity of con tract between the carrier of the mail and the owner who confided it to the department for transportation But evidently neither r892 Q B 422COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW of these considerations relieves a carrier of the mail under contract from liability in tort to the department as bailee of the owner for loss of or injury to such mail in course of transportation If the owners of the Winkfield who had assumed no duty what ever to the department with reference to the mail were held prop erly chargeable for negligence in the management of the ship which resulted in loss of the mail in the possession of the depart ments bailee certainly this bailee himself must be liable for any negligence which should result in similar loss It would further appear that if the distinction taken in Sawyer v Corse between inferior postal officers or agents and private employees of a postal officer or agent who are not accepted or recognized by the govern ment as under its control and direction is sound then a carrier of the mail under contract is liable for the torts of his servants who are not in any way connected with the postal service and who owe no special duty to the department by reason of relation to it but owe duty only to the contractor as employer It may also be suggested that even when the mailmatter being transported by the carrier is in the possession and control of an officer or agent of the department so that possession has not passed to the carrier as bailee nevertheless the carrier must respond in damages for tort if through his wrongful act or that of his employee or servant not engaged in the service of the department injury or loss occurs for as to such matter he has assumed a relation necessarily in volving a duty of care and breach of this duty would constitute a tort A discussion of the question whether a carrier of the mail might by contract with the department relieve himself from this liability or limit the extent thereof and whether such contract if valid as between himself and the department would also be binding as against the owner of the mail matter is not here con templated It is sufficient for present purposes to seek a solution of the question as to liability in tort without reference to con tractual limitations of such liability To use a hypothetical case for illustration of the principles involved in the cases now to be considered would a contractor for the carriage of the mails between the railroad station and the postoffice assuming him to have been sworn and given security as an employee of the postoffice department be exempted from liability to the owner of mailmatter for a loss due to the negli gence of a driver whom he had incidentally and casually employed in driving his cart 642LIABILITY OF CARRIERS OF THE MAIL 643 The cases with reference to which the foregoing suggestions have been made relate to the liability of a railroad company engaged in carrying the mail to the owner of a letter or parcel destroyed as a result of the negligence of its employees The cases thus directly referred to are Bankers Mutual Casualty Co v Minneapolis etc Ry1 decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in July I902 and Boston Ins Co v C R I  P R Co17 decided by the Supreme Court of Iowa in October of the same year In the Iowa case it was assumed for the pur poses of the decision that a package of money in course of trans mission by registered mail being carried by the defendant railroad company in a mail car under contract with the postoffice depart ment was destroyed as a result of the negligence of the employees of the defendant in the operation of the train while in the Circuit Court of Appeals case it was assumed that a package of paper money consigned to the mail in like manner was lost through the negligence of a station agent of the railroad company into whose custody the mail pouch containing it had been delivered by the agent of the department in charge of the mail car on the defend ants train In each case the package of money was mailed by a bank and the action was brought by an insurance company which had assured the safe transportation of the package and now sued by right of subrogation In each case it was conceded that the railroad employee whose negligence resulted in the loss or destruc tion of the package was not an agent or servant of the postoffice department and had no relation to it In each case the railroad company was held not to be liable to the owner of the package for its loss The line of reasoning in the Circuit Court of Appeals case was substantially this First no contractual relation existed between the railroad company and the owner of the package Second the railroad company was not a common carrier as to the package thus transported Third the railroad company was but an instrumen tality of the government engaged in the discharge of a public function And fourth the station agent through whose negligence the package was lost was also engaged in the discharge of a public function although he had not been sworn as an official or employee of the postoffice department was not appointed or recognized by it and was in no way under its direction or control The con clusion of the court was therefore predicated upon the recognized 6C C A I902 XI7 Fed 434 54 C C A 608 I902 II8 Iowa 423COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW rule that superior postal officers are not liable for the negligence or default of inferior officers or agents of the department but only for their own personal negligence or default in the discharge of their duties The postmaster cases were cited and the cases of Sawyer v Corse and Central R  B Co v Lampley hereinbefore considered were said to be unsound In the Iowa case which approved in general the result reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals the reasoning was substantially as follows First the duties of the railroad company in carrying the mails under contract with the postoffice department are only those created by statute or arising out of the contract and the company owes no duty and incurs no liability in the performance of such contract to the owner of mailmatter which is being transported Second the railroad company is not a bailee of matter which in the course of transportation is in the custody and control of a mail agent Third the company in the performance of its contract is discharging a public function and is therefore a public officer not liable for the negligence or default of a subordinate officer or agent of the department The courts conclusion was that the doctrine of respondeat superior does not apply in such a case The postmaster and postal carrier cases were cited without reference to the conflict of authority as to the liability of a carrier of the mails for the default of his private servants In neither of these cases is there a discussion of possible tort liability entirely distinct from the liability assumed by contract or arising out of the undertaking to discharge a public function under the authority of the postoffice department The Wink field case is not noticed as it seems not to have occurred to either court to consider the question whether in analogy to that case if one railroad company negligently operating its train so as to destroy mailmatter carried in the train of another railroad should be held liable to the owner of such mailmatter on the broad rules of tort liability the railroad engaged in transporting such mail should not on similar principles be subject to the same liability These cases have not escaped adverse comment though it can hardly be said that a conflict of authority as to the exact question has yet arisen In Barker v Chicago etc Ry18 the Supreme Court of Illinois had before it the question whether a postal clerk injured through the negligence of a railroad company in operating the train on which the plaintiff was engaged in the discharge of his duties could recover damages for such injuries In answer to the 18Igo9 243 III 482 644LIABILITY OF CARRIERS OF THE MAIL 645 contention that the company was a governmental agency perform ing a public function and not therefore liable for the negligence of its employees the court expressed the view that the company was not a public officer or agent but a contractor with the government for the performance of a special service and that the same reason does not exist for holding it exempt from liability for the negli gence of its servants as for holding the postmastergeneral or a postmaster exempt from liability for the defaults of those who act under him in the public service as agents of the government and the court cited with approval the cases of Sawyer v Corse and Central R  B Co v Lampley It cited as contrary to these cases and in connection with Conwell v Voorhees and Hutchins v Brackett the two cases from the Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Iowa above commented upon and dis approved of the theory therein adopted The history of the evolution of this interesting question would not be complete without reference to the case of United States v Atlantic Coast Line R R9 recently decided in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina In a collision between two trains of the defendant railroad due to the negligence of its employees a mail car forming a part of one of the trains and the mailmatter carried therein were destroyed by fire The action was brought by the United States to recover damages for the loss of certain registered mailmatter in such car consisting in part of a package containing diamonds in course of transmission by mail from the sender in France to its destination in Cuba If there had been any controversy as to whether the package containing the diamonds was in fact in the mail car destroyed the evidence that many diamonds had been found and carried away by persons who raked over the ashes of the car would no doubt have been quite persuasive But it appeared that by the postal convention between France and the United States diamonds were not mailable matter and the court reached the very reasonable conclusion that since the owner could not have sued for the diamonds the United States suing in behalf of the owner was limited to that recovery which would have been available to the ownerwith the result that as the diamonds were never accepted for transportation by mail no liability as to such trans portation was assumed by the railroad company undertaking in this country to carry mailmatter only and having no knowledge that property of value other than mailmatter was included in the D C I913 206 Fed Igo affirmed C C A I914 215 Fed 56COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW mail pouches But with reference to the right of the United States to sue in behalf of the owner of letters and packages lost through the negligence of a contracting carrier the court made some observations which may well be noted Cases in a Circuit Court of Appeal and in Circuit Courts of the United States were cited in which it has been held that the United States is a bailee of letters and parcels consigned to the mails for transportation with the result that in an action against an officer or agent of the department under bond the United States may recover against the bondsmen the value of the articles wrongfully abstracted by such officer from the mail without regard to any question as to liability of the government to such owner or the measure of such liability20 But the court although noting the possibility of a tort liability on the part of the contracting carrier of mails to the owner of the mailmatter lost or destroyed by negligence cites with approval the cases of the Boston Insurance Co and the Bankers Mutual Casualty Co as though they were conclusive on that question and merely applications of the English postmaster general cases thus missing entirely the thought of a distinction with reference to tort liability between a postal officer sued for the wrong of a subordinate postal officer and that of a contracting carrier sued for the tort of his private servant Something should be said perhaps as to the suggestion in Boston Insurance Co v C R I  P R Co supra that a rail road carrying mailmatter transported in locked bags in charge of postal officers has no knowledge or means of knowledge as to its value and should not be liable therefor even though lost by the negligence of its servants That this reason for exemption from liability is not controlling may be illustrated by what is said in United States v Atlantic Coast Line R R above considered In that case it was well said that since the diamonds were not mail able and since neither the postal authorities nor the railroad had knowledge or could be charged with notice of their presence in the mail they were never accepted for transportation But the court seemed to think that the failure in some way to advise the postal authorities and the railroad that the contents of the package was of exceptional value was in itself sufficient to relieve the rail road from liability on the theory that if the nature of the articles had been disclosed special precaution for safety would have teen adopted and a higher charge exacted In the case of Gibbon v National Surety Co v United States C C A I904 xi9 Fed 7o United States v American Surety Co C C 19o7 I55 Fed 94I United States v American Surety Co C C I9o8 i6I Fed I49 646LIABILITY OF CARRIERS OF THE MAIL 647 Paynton2 from which the court made a quotation Lord Mansfield was careful to base his decision that the carrier was not liable for the loss of money hidden in some hay in an old bag delivered for transportation upon a finding of affirmative fraud on the part of the sender The suggestion in Southcotes Case22 that delivery for safe keeping of a locked chest containing goods did not charge the bailee with regard to the goods has not been followed In determining the liability of a passenger carrier for the contents of the passengers trunk the test is not whether the carrier has been advised or had notice of the extraordinary value of articles contained in the trunk but whether such articles are of the class or character which may be so carried that is baggage23 On simi lar reasoning a safety deposit company is held liable to one who rents a box in its vaults for the negligent loss of the contents of such box although it has no means whatever of knowing the exceptional value of such contents24 The rule not only as to carriers but as to all persons who undertake to render a service in the transportation or keeping of property intrusted to them seems to be that in the absence of fraud tending to mislead the custodian into assuming a risk which could not have been antici pated the custodian is chargeable with the value of the contents of a box or package or parcel although locked or sealed if such contents are of the general character of goods intended to be accepted If the custodian does not wish to rely upon the general character of the box or package as an indication of the contents he must make inquiry or limit his liability by some form of special acceptance It would seem clear that a railroad accepting mail for transportation cannot complain of want of notice of special character or value of the contents of the mail bags if they contain only such articles as may lawfully be sent in that manner It is suggested therefore in conclusion that the question of the liability of a contract carrier of mails to the owner of mail matter lost or destroyed through the negligence of the servants of such contractor who are in no sense employees of the postal de partment has not yet been adequately discussed by the courts and that the negative answer given in the two cases on the subject as above cited is far from satisfactory EMLIN McCLAIN STATE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA 2I769 4 Burr 2298 x6oo 4 Coke 83 Railroad v Fraloff 1879 Ioo U S 24 2National Safe Deposit Co v

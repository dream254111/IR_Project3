since that considering Mr Newtons Theorem for Raising a Binomi al to any given Power or Extracting any Root of the same I enquired whether what he had done for a Binomial could not be done for an infinite Multino mial I soon found the thing was possible and effected it as you may see in the following Paper I design in a little time to shew the Uses it may be applied to In the mean while those that are already versd in the Doctrine of Infinite Series and have seen what Appli cations Mr Newton has made of his Theorem may of themselves derive several Uses from this I suppose that the Infinite Number Multinomial is azbzzcz3dz4ez5 c m is the Index of the Pow er to which this Multinomial ought to be Raisd or is you will tis the Index of the Root which is to be Ex tracted I say that this Power or Root of the Multi nomial is such a Series as I have exprest For the Understanding of it it is only necessary to consider all the Terms by which the same Power of z is Multiplied in order thereto I distinguish two things in each of these Terms 1 The Product of certain Powers620 Powers of the quantities a b c d c 2 the Unciae as Oughtred calls em prefixt to these Products To find all the Products belonging to the same Power of z to that Product for instance whose Index is mr where r may denote any integer Number I divide these Products into several Classes those which imme diately after some certain Power of a by which all these Products begin have b I call Products of the 1rst Classis For Example am4b3e is a Product of the 1rst Classis because b immediately follows am4 those which immediately after some Power of a have c I call Pro ducts of the 2d Classis so am3ccd is a Product of the 2d Classis Those which immediately after some Power of a have d I call Products of the 3d Classis and so of the rest This being done I Multiply all the Products belong ing to zmr1 which precedes immediately zmr by b and Divide em all by a 2 I Multiply by c and Di vide by a all the Products belonging to zmr2 Except those of the 1rst Classis 3 I Multiply by d and Di vide by a all the Products belonging to zmr3 Except those of the 1rst and 2d Classis 4 I Multiply by e and Divide by a all the Terms belonging to zmr4 Ex cept those of the 1rst 2d and 3d Classis and so on till I meet twice with the same term Lastly I add to all these Terms the Product of am1 into the Letter whose Exponent is r1 Here I must take notice that by the Exponent of a Letter I mean the number which expresses what Place the Letter has in the Alphabet so 3 is the Exponent of the Letter c because the Letter c is the 3d in the Alpha bet It is evident that by this Rule you may easily find all the Products belonging to the several Powers of z if you have but the Product belonging to zm viz am To621 To find the Unciae which ought to be prefixt to eve ry Product I consider the Sum of Units contained in the Indices of the Letters which compose it the Index of a excepted I write as many Terms of the Series mm1m2m3c as there are Units in the Sum of these Indices this Series is to be the Numerator of a Fraction whose Denominator is the Product of the se veral Series 1  2  3  4  5 c 1  2  3  4  5 c 1  2  3  4  5  6 c the 1rst of which contains as many Terms as there are Units in the Index of b the 2d as many as there are Units in the Index of c the 3d as many as there are Units in the Index of d the 4th as many as there are Units in the Index of e c Demonstration To raise the Series azbzzcz3  dz4 c to a ny Power whatsoever write so many Series equal to it as these are Units in the Index of the Power demanded Now it is evident that when these Series are so Multi plied there are several Products in which there is the same Power of z thus if the Series azbzzcz3 dz4 c is raisd to its Cube you have the Products b3z6 abcz6 aadz6 in which you find the same Power z 6 Therefore let us consider what is the Condition that can make some Products to contain the same Power of z the first thing that will appear in relation to it is that in any Product whatsoever the Index of z is the Sum of the particular Indices of z in the Multiplying Terms this follows from the the nature of Indices thus b3z6 is the Product of bz2 bz2 b z2 and the Sum of the In dices in the Multiplying Terms is 222 6 abcz6 in the Product of az bzz cz3 and the Sumof them Indices of z in the Multiplying Terms is 1236 aadz6 is the Product of az az dz4 and the Sum of the Z z z z Indices622 Indices of z in the Multiplying Terms is 1146 the next thing that appears is that the Index of z in the Multiplying Terms is the same with the Exponent of the Letter to which z is joynd from which two Consi derations it follows that To have all the Products be longing to a certain Power of z you must find all the Products where the Sum of the Exponents of the Letters which compose em shall always be the same with the In dex of that Power Now this is the method I use to find easily all the Products belonging to the same Power of z Let mr be the Index of that Power I consider that the Sum of the Exponents of the Letters which com pose these Products must exceed by 1 those which belong to mmr1 now because the excess of the Expo nent of the Letter b above the Exponent of the Letter a is 1 it follows that if each of the Products belong ing to zmr1 is Multiplid by b and Diuided by a you will have Products the Sum of whose Exponents will be mr Likewise the Sum of the Exponents of the Letters which compose the Products belonging to zmr exceeds by 2 the Sum of the Exponents of the Letters which compose the Products belonging to zmr2 Now because the Exponent of the Letter a is less by 2 than the Exponent of the letter c it follows that if each Pro duct belonging to zmr2 is Multiplid by c and Divi ded by a you will have other Products the Sum of whose Exponents is still mr Now if all the Products belonging to zmr2 were Multiplied by c and Divided by a you would have some Products that would be the same as some of those found before therefore you must except out of em those that I have calld Products of the 1rst Classis what I have said shows why all the Products belonging to zmr3 except those of the 1rst and 2d Classis must be Multiplid by d and Divided by a Lastly you see the Reason why to all these Products is added623 added the Product of am 1 by the Letter whose Exponent is r1 Tis because the Sum of the Exponents is still mr As for what relates to the Unciae observe that when you Multiply azbzzcz3dz4 c by azbzzcz3 dz4 c each Letter a b c d c of the 2d Series is Multiplid by each of the Letters a b c d c of the 1rst Series Thus the Letter a of the 2d Series is Mul tiplid by the letter b of the 1rst and the letter b of he 2d Series is Multiplid by the Letter a of the 1rst therefore you have the 2 Planes ab ab or 2ab for the same reason you have 2ac 2ad c Therefore you must prefix to each Plane of those that compose the Square of the Infinite Series azbzzcz3 c the Number which expresses how many ways the Letters of each Plane may be changed Likewise if you Multiply the Product of the two preceeding Series by azbzzcz3 c each Letter a b c d of the 3d Series is Multiplied by each of the Planes formd by the Product of the 1rst and 2d Series Thus the Letter a is Multiplied by the Planes bc and cb the Letter b is Multiplied by ac and ca the Letter c is Multiplied by ab and ba theresore you have the 6 Solids abc acb bac bca cab cba or 6abc Therefore you must prefix to each Solid whereof the Cube of the Infinite Series is composd the Number which expresses how many ways the Letters of each Solid may be Changed And generally You must pre fix to any Product whereof any Power of the Infinite Series azbzzcz3 c is composd the Number which expresses how many ways the Letter of each Product may be changed Now to find how many ways the Letters of any Pro duct for instances amn bh cp dr may be changed this is the Rule which is commonly given write as many terms of the Series 1  2  3  4  5 c as there are Units in the Sum of the Indicesviz mnhpr let this Series Z z z z 2 be624 be the Numerator of a Fraction whose Denominator shall be the Product of the Series 1  2  3  4  5 c 1  2  3  4  5 c 1  2  3  4  5  6 c 1  2  3  4  5 c whereof the 1rst is to contain as many Terms as there Units in the 1rst Index mn the 2d as many as there are Units in the 2d Index h the 3d as many as there are Units in the 3d Index p the 4th as many as there are Units in the 4th Index r But the Numera tor and Denominator of this Fraction have a common Divisor viz the Series 1  2  3  4  5 c continued to so many Terms as there are Units in the 1rst Index mn therefore let both this Numerator and Denominator be Divided by this common Divisior then this new Nume rator will begin with mn1 whereas tother began with 1 and will contain so many Terms as there are Units in hpr that is so many as there are Units in the Sum of all the Indices excepting the 1rst as for the new Denominator it will be the Product of 3 Series only that is of so many as there Indices excepting the 1rst But if it happens withal that n be equal to hpr as it always happens in our Theorem then the Numerator beginning by mn1 and being continu ed to so many Terms as there are Units in hpr or n the last Term will be m necessarily so if you in vert the Series and make that the first Term which was the LasttheNumerator will be m  m1  m2  m3 c conntinued to so many Terms as there are Units in the Sum of the Indices of each Product ex cepting the 1rst Index There remains but one thing to demonstrate which is that what I have said of Powers whose Index is an Integer may be adapted to Roots or Powers whose Index is a Fraction but it appears at first sight why it should be so for the same Reason which makes me consider Roots un der the Notion of Powers will make me conclude that625 that whatever is said of one may be said of tother However I think to give sometime a more formal De monstration of it See the Theorem Fig 5

DEEDSAcknowledyments of married womenSufficiency of certilicate It is not necessary that the certificate of acknowledgment of a married woman to a deed shall conform to the exact words of the statute or that the several requisites mentioned in the statute shall be stated in the cer tificate in the order given in the statute A substantial compliance with the statute is all that is required The chief object of the statute was to protect married women from the imposition and coercion of their hus bands and when this appears to have been accomplished minor de fects and omissions will be disregarded  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter1903 GEIL V GEIL 531 2 DEEDsAcknowledgment of married womenCertificate A certificate of acknowledgment of a married woman which shows that the writing was fully explained to her that she was examined by the officer privily and apart from her husband and that she declared that she had willingly executed the same and does not wish to retract it sufficiently shows that she acknowledged the execution of the paper to be her act Hockman v McClanahan 87 Va 33 and Clinch River Veneer Co v Kurth 90 Va 737 overruled Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Rockingham county pronounced October 29 1902 in a suit in chancery wherein the appellant was the complainant and the appellee was the defendant Reversed The opinion states the case Sipe  Harris and J B Stephenson for the appellant Winfield Liggett for the appellee HARRISON J delivered the opinion of the court The first question to be determined in this case is raised by the crossappeal and involves the sufficiency of the acknowledgment of Rebecca Geil to the deed dated September 29 1871 from Henry Geil and wife to Jacob Geil So far as necessary to be stated the language of that certificate is as follows We do further certify that Rebecca Geil wife of Henry Geil whose name is likewise signed to the writing hereto annexed bearing date as aforesaid also personally appeared before us in our said county and having the writing aforesaid fully explained to her and being examined by us privily and apart from her said husband she the said Rebecca Geil declared that she had willingly executed the same and does not wish to retract it The statute by which the sufficiency of this acknowledgment must be tested is found in Code 1873 p 906 c 117 sec 4 It directs that the certificate of the justices must show that the married woman personally appeared before them that she was examined privily and apart frorn her husband and had the writing fully ex plained to her that she acknowledged it to be her act and deed and declared hat she had willingly executed the same and did not wish to retract it It is the poli y of the law to uphold certificates of acknowledg ment Clerical defects or omissions and obvious technical errors532 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Oct will be disregarded if the law has been reasonably and fairly com plied with Such certificates should be liberally construed if the substance be found the great object being to protect the married woman from imposition and coercion by her husband It is gen erally held and often by this court that in the acknowledgment of a deed by a married woman it is sufficient if it appears that the statute has been substantially observed and followed A literal com pliance is not demanded or expected As was said by Judge Mon cure in Grove v Zumbro infra to demand a literal compliance with them would be unnecessarily to obstruct the alienation of prop erty and throw a cloud over titles Devlin on Deeds sec 571 Langhorne v Hobsorn 4 Leigh 224 Hairston v Randolphs 12 Leigh 445 Grove v Zumbro 14 Gratt 501 Boiling v Teel 76 Va 496 Dundas v Hitchcock 12 How 256 13 L Ed 978 Deery v Cray 5 Wall 795 18 L Ed 653 We are of opinion that the certificate under consideration substan tially comnplies with the law that its prime object has been accom plished and the wife fully protected from imposition or coercion bv the husband so far as the justices could accomplish that end in tak inc tlhe acknowledgment The first objection urged to the certificate is that it fails to show that the explanation of the deed was made to the wife privily and apart from her husband It is not denied that the wife was privily examined by the officers and that the certificate clearly shows that fact but the contention is that because the declaration that the deed was fully explained to her precedes in order of statement the declaration that she was examined privily and apart from her hus band therefore it does not appear that the deed was explained while the wife was apart from her husband Conceding for the pur poses of this case merely that the explanation of the deed by the jutstices is one of the things that must be done without the presence of the husband we think the objection technical and unsubstantial Tie certificate declares in the language of the statute that the wife appeared before the functionaries had the writing fullv explained to her and was examined privily and apart from her husband and declared that she had willingly executed the deed and did not wish to retract it The order in which these several requisites are stated in the certificate is immaterial The law has been substantially complied with when the certificate shows that all of its requisites have been substantially met If the statement that the wife had1903 GEIL V GEIL 533 been examined privily and apart from her husband had been at the foot of the certificate it would have been as effectual as it would have been if that statement had appeared first The justices having certified that the deed was explained to the wife and the privy ex amination had the presumption is that it was done in the manner contemplated by the statute The second objection to the certificate is that it does not appear that the wife acknowledged the deed to be her act It is true that the certificate does not contain the words and acknowledged the same to be her act but it declares that she willingly executed the deed and does not wish to retract it We concur in the view expressed by a learned author that it is difficult to comprelhend how a married woman can declare that she has willingly executed a deed and does not wish to retract it with out thereby in substance and effect acknowledging the deed to be her act Burks Separate Estate of AMarried Women p 2 Judge Allen in Flairston v Randolphs 12 Leigh 445 savs The certificate must in some form show that she acknowledged the deed We are of opinion that when the wife apart from her husband de clares that she has willingly executed a deed and does not wish to retract it she in substance and effect acknowledges the deed to be her act and the law is substantially complied with We are aware that this conclusion is in conflict with the cases of Hockman v McClanahan 87 Va 33 12 S E 230 and Clinch River Veneer Company v Kurth 90 Va 737 19 S E 878 where it is held tat the omission from the certificate of the words and acknowledged the same to be her act was fatal and vitiated the conveyance We regard the conclusion reached in these cases as technical not war ranted by the law as established prior thereto and calculated to dis turb property rights There being no rule of property established by these decisions we feel less hesitation in overrulinlg them and re turning to the more liberal rule of construction established by this court prior to the decisions mentioned In this view of the case it is unnecessary to pass upon other ques tions presented by the record before us For these reasons the decree appealed from must be reversecl and the cause remanded for further proceedings not in conflict with this opinion Reversed EDITORIAL NOTE We cannot withhold a word of

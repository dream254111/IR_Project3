in expectorated fluids and in that from the oyster were first examined but since nitrate of silver and acetate of lead which have been supposed to detect mucus were found to act principally on the salts contained in them it became necessary to employ other means for the removal of the salts and the voltaic apparatus was applied for the purpose of extracting the alkalies at one pole and the acids at the opposite But there oc curred a phenomenon that was wholly unexpected as a considerable coagulation of albumen took place at the negative pole which Mr Brande at the suggestion of Mr Davy is inclined to ascribe to the separation of alkali with which it was combined and to which its solubility was owing It is observed in confirmation that when an egg is boiled for some time in water the liquid becomes alkaline to tests and still deposits by electrization a small quantity of albumen which the alkali re tains in solution The coagulation of albumen by acids is also ascribed to their su perior affinity for the alkali For discovering the nature of the saline ingredients the water in which some white of egg had been boiled and macerated was elec trified by a powerful battery through the medium of a cup of water on each side After the process had continued for one hour the fluids were examined that on the negative side contained a quan tity of soda nearly pure and that on the positive side a small quan tity of albumen with a little muriatic acid but not enough to satu rate the alkali The same means of analytic investigation being applied to other fluids detected larger quantities of albumen than were discoverable by heat alone as in saliva in the mucus from the oyster the mucus from the trachea in bile in milk and in the liquor of Amnios and hence the author is led to doubt whether mucus may not be a com pound of albumen either with muriate of soda or with excess of soda Hints on the Subject of animal Secretions By Everard Home Esq FRS Communicated by the Society for the Improvement of Ani mal Chemistry Read June 22 1809 Phil Trans 1809 p 385 The separation by electric powers of substances chemically united suggests the possibility that since the same power is known to exist in the torpedo and electrical eel it might be the means by which secretion in all animals is effected Since in these fish the abundance of nerves connected with the electrical organs proves that this power resides in them and since the arrangement of many nerves in animal bodies has evidently no connexion with sensation it seems not improbable that these may answer the purpose of supplying and regulating the organs of secre tion With a view to determine what changes could be produced in the blood similar to secretion Mr Brande applied the power of twenty343 four pair of fourinch plates of copper and zinc to blood and extracted acid and alkali at the opposite wires A second experiment was made with similar results on blood still fluid in the vein of an animal just killed A third experiment was made upon serum with 120 plates highly charged with the same result A fourth experiment was conducted in a similar manner with 12 pair of plates with sinmilar results In a fifth experiment 30 pair of plates very weakly charged also extracted alkali and acid from serum exposed to them Since powers so weak are capable of separating the constituent parts of blood it is suggested that the weaker powers existing in animals may produce the same effect and thus occasion all the dif ferent secretions and modify albumen into the states of the different animal solids On the comparative Influence of Male and Female Parents on their Offspring By Thomas Andrew Knight Esq FRS In a Letter to the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks Bart KB PRS Read June 22 1809 Phil Trans 1809 p 392 During the very extensive series of Mr Knights endeavours to improve the varieties of fruittrees he has also been occupied in making correspondent experiments on the breeding of animals and has always paid attention to the strong analogy which universally subsists between plants and animals in most points relating to gene ration Although the authors experiments have extended to many different species of fruittrees yet the greatest number and those under the most favourable circumstances were upon appletrees But as the results were all in unison the instances here adduced are from the apple alone Linmneus conceived the character of the male to predominate in the exterior both of plants and animals but Mr Knights observations have led him to form a different conclusion for he remarks that seedling plants and the young of animals inherit much more of the character of the female Seeds from cultivated appletrees impregnated by the Siberian crab produced larger fruit than those from the crab impregnated by stamina from the cultivated fruit but the quality and flavour of the fruit appeared to inherit in a greater degree the qualities of the male In consequence of the frequent intermixtures that have taken place in the breeding of domesticated animals there is often little resem blance to either parent but it is observed that the dimensions of the offspring are regulated principally by those of the female and that a corresponding length of legs appears especially necessary for accompanying the parent in flight But unless the male parent be proportionally strong the legs of the offspring may be too long in

At Wytheville June 14 1900 1 SEPARATE ESTATESInchoate dowerRelease directly to husbandSections 2501 and 2502 of Code The contingent right of dower of a wife in her husbands lands is not a separate estate within the meaning of chapter 103 of the Code and the wife having no other estate with reference to which she might con tract is not bound by the provisions of a deed of separation whereby she released directly to her husband her dower in her lands Sections 2501 and 2502 relate to deeds from husband and wife to third parties 2 JoINTUREDefinitionAt common lawIn Virginia Jointure at common law consists of an estate or interest in land to take effect in possession or profit immediately on the death of the husband in satisfaction of dower and it must so appear in the deed It is an absolute bar only when made before marriage If made after marriage it only puts the wife to her election whether to accept the provision or claim dower The only difference made by statute in Virginia is that the jointure may be of personal as well as real estate 3 JoINrUREEssentials to bar dower If after the husbands death the widow accepts a provision made for her in lieu of dower she bars herself of dower but if slie has received the provision during her husbands lifetime and has spent or wasted it she may take her dower as if no provision had been made It is necessary in order to estop her that she should have enjoyed the pro vision or a part of it at least after her husbands death 4 HUSBAND AND WIFEDeed of separation When void as to wifeMAoney con sideration paid by

sections 2277 and 2278 of the Code also apply Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Princess Anne county pronounced March 27 1899 in a suit in chancery wherein the appel lant was the complainant and the appellees were the defendants Reversed The opinion states the case  Reported by M P IBurks State Reporter 158 JulyBurroughs  Bro for the appellant Wm McK Woodhouse for the appellees CARDWELL J This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Princess Anne county and the case is as follows Appellant Laura L Land intermarried with John W S Land March 9 1890 and they lived together as husband and wife till June 27 1896 when they signed and acknowledged a deed of separation which was admitted to record in the clerks office of Princess Anne County Court The deed recites that owing to an incompatibility of temperament the parties mutually find it impossible for them to live happily and congenially together as hushand and wife and desired that each shall have the same liberty of person and personal rights and the same power to manage control use alien or convey their respective separate estates both real and personal which they or either of them now own or may hereafter acquire as if they were unmarried The consideration stated is the premises and 400 in cash paid by the husband to the wife followed with a mutual agreement that from that date the parties will live separate and apart from each other that each shall and will refrain from interfering with the person or prop erty of the other that they mutually and severally release and quit claim dower tenancy by the curtesy and all other rights which they may respectively acquire or may have already acquired by reason of their marriage in the property of each other that each shall enjoy free from molestation or interference of the other the same freedom of person the same rights of person and property and the unre strained power to manage control use transfer assign alien or con vey his or her separate estate then owned or thereafter acquired as if they had never been married They further mutually covenanted and agreed that the child born to them should remain in the posses sion of the mother free from the management and control of the father and he to be in no manner held responsible for the support and maintenance of the mother or child On the date of the deed of separation the husband executed a deed of trust in which the wife did not unite upon a tract of land about 132 acres situated in Princess Anne county and the only real estate owned by the husband to secure the payment of a debt of 56947 for borrowed money and out of which the 400 was paid to the wife Default having been made in the payment of the debt secured by 190oo 159 LAND V SHIPP160 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER July this trust deed the property was sold by the trustee in the lifetime of the husband to H E Shipp at the price of 3050 and after the payment of the costs of sale a debt of the husband secured by a for mer trust deed on the property in which the wife united the debt of 56947 with interest secured by the deed under which the trustee sold the balance of the purchase money was paid over by the trustee to the husband H E Shipp sold and conveyed the land on the 26th of May 1898 to Emerson Land at the price of 3500 having pre viously sold the timber on it for 250 and her husband having died appellant instituted this suit against H E Shipp and Emerson Land appellees claiming dower in the land and in the proceeds from the timber sold therefrom by Shipp She alleges in her bill that she was forced by her husbands threats of violence to execute the deed of separation from him of June 27 1896 but this is not clearly shown by the proof Therefore appellees contend first that appellant is bound by the provisions of the deed of separation which relate to her dower and having relinquished it by deed duly of record she cannot after the death of her husband assert her right of dower in the lands of which he was seized during the coverture and second that if the deed of separation did not release or relinquish appellants dower in the land she cannot assert claim to it and retain the money paid her in lieu thereof To sustain the first contention it is necessary to regard the wifes inchoate right of dower in her husbands lands as her statutory sepa rate estate with reference to which she has the power under the Married Womans Act chapter 103 of the Code to contract Sections 2501 and 2502 of the Code provide how deeds or conveyances by the husband and wife may be acknowledged for recordation and the effect of such conveyances when recorded upon the dower of the wife or her estate in the lands conveyed They are substantially the same as the provisions in the Codes of 1873 and 1860 relating to the acknowl edgment recordation and effect of a deed by husband and wife when recorded upon the dower of the wife etc except that the privy ex amination of the wife is dispensed with In Switzer v Switzer 26 Gratt 574 the question was raised as to the effect of the acknowledgment of a deed of separation between hus band and wife under these statutes as they formerly stood and it was held that they only applied to conveyances from husband and wife to a third party Says the court in the opinion by Staples J It is the union of the husband and wife as grantors that makes the instrument operative The court in that case expressly waiving the deci sion of the general question as to whether any deed of separation was valid to any extent or for any purpose held that a contract or agree ment for separation made directly with the husband is void as to the wife as her legal existence is merged in his and she is presumed to be acting under his influence The Married Womans Act makes no reference directly or indirectly to the rights of the wife in the husbands property real or personal acquired by the marriage It simply enlarges the powers of the wife over property declared in the act to be her separate estate There is nothing whatever in the act conferringupon the wife the power to contract generally whether she had separate estate or not Hirth v Hirth 2 Va S C R 137 5 Va Law Reg 594 97 Va Instead of enlarging the scope of the statute as it originally stood and which makes provision as to how the wife may relinquish her right of dower in her husbands lands the legislature has since the passage of the Married Womans Act restricted its scope by adding the following words thereto Such writing shall not operate any further upon the wife or her representatives by means of any covenant or warranty contained therein which is not made with reference to lier separate estate as a source of credit or which if it relates to her said right of dower or to any estate or interest conveyed other than her own is not made with reference to her separate estate as a source of credit Sec 2502 of the Code The plain purpose of this amendment and its effect is not the enlargement of the scope of the statute by reason of the Married Womans Act but a restriction so as not to affect the separate estate unless the covenants in the deed were made with refer ence to her separate estate as a source of credit In Mason v lMason 140 Mass 63 the wife by her deed made in her husbands life time in consideration of 300 paid her by the hus band or out of his estate undertook to convey to a son of the husband and one of the devisees under his will subsequently made all right title and interest which she then had or might thereafter have in her husbands estate expressly referring to her right of dower After the husbands death the wife claimed dower in his estate and the same defence was made to her demand as is made in the case at bar and it was held that the vifes inchoate right of dower was not separate estate that the wife might dispose of in the life of the husband that such a conveyance did not bar her dower and that she was not com pelled to refund the 300 as a condition of havinz her dower assigned 1900 161 LAND V SHIPP6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER The opinion expressly says that the statute in force in Massachusettes conferring upon a married woman the power to make contracts must be limited in construction so as to exclude the right of a married wo man to make contracts for the conveyance of her right of dower In lWhite v Wager 25 N Y 328 it was held that the disability of a husband to take land by conveyance from his wife is not re moved by the statute enabling her to devise and convey as if she were unmarried In Flynn v Flynn 171 Mass 312it was held that until the hus bands death and the actual assignment of the dower the wife or widow has no estate in the land but her interest is an inchoate charge of a peculiar nature which while it may be released to a vendee of the husband cannot be assigned or conveyed to any other In Moore v New York 8 N Y 110 which was also a proceeding to condemn lands of a married man under the New York statutes it was insisted that the wife was a necessary party defendant but the court held as in the case of Flynn v Flynn supra that she was not for the reason that while her inchoate right of dower in the land was an interest which might be released it was not the subject of grant or assignment  nor is it in any sense an interest in real estate We are cited by counsel for appellees to Jones v Fleming decided by the Court of Appeals of New York 104 N Y 418 10 N E R 693 and Rhodes v Dais 51 Mich 306 as holding that the wifes inchoate right of dower is her separate estate which she may release to her husband by virtue of the Married Womans Act The case of Jones v Fleming is very unlike the case at bar In that case the contract was between the children of the husband by a former marriage the committee of the husband a lunatic and the wife by which the wife in consideration of 3400 and the settlement of certain suits as to alimony agreed to release her right of dower in the husbands lands The contract was with a third party the chil dren of the husband not a contract with the husband Besides the court had in several previous cases decided that a married woman under their statute had the power to contract generally and whether she had separate estate or not at the time of the contract was im material Ackley v Wtestervelt 86 N Y 448 Leimeyer v Tcurnquist 85 N Y 516 This is contrary to the views expressed by this court in construing our Married Womans Act Hirth v fIirth supra In Rhodes v Davis supra the Supreme Court of Michigan con struing the statute of that State very similar to our Married Womans 162 JulyAct does hold that a married womans release to her husband of her dower right if made for a good consideration and without fraud or improper dealing is binding upon the wife In other words the court took the view that the act permitting the wife to dispose of her inter ests as if single empowered her to contract with reference to her in choate right of dower in her husbands estate regarding her dower interest as her statutory separate estate In this view we are unable to concur It is not in accord with the trend of the decisions of this court holding that the Married Womans Act gives to the wife such estate as is indicated by the plain words of the statute and such control of it as the statute directs and that in all other respects the relations of husband and wife as to property re main unaltered Section 2284 of chapter 103 Married Womans Act is specific in enumerating the various species of property that constitute the separate estate of a married woman and it is not pos sible we think by any liberality of construction to bring the inchoate right of dower in lands of which the husband is seized during the coverture within its provisions The only ground upon which appellant could be required to refund the 400 paid to her by her husband before having dower assigned in the lands in question is that the deed of separation of June 27 1896 created a statutory jointure and that she cannot retain the jointure and have dower in the land Sections 2270 and 2271 of the Code as to the jointure differ from jointure at common law only in that under the statute it may be of personal as well as real estate At common law the essentials of jointure were It must consist of an estate or in terest in land to take effect in possession or profit immediately on the death of the huband and must be made in satisfaction of the dower and so appear in the deed It is an absolute bar only when made be fore marriage if made after marriage it only puts the wife to her election whether to accept the provision or claim dower Under the statute as well as at common law a provision in lieu of dower is to take effect at the death of the husband for it is then that the widow is put to her election as to whether she will accept the jointure or claim dower in her husbands estate and the provision of the statute is that when she shall elect and receive her dower the estate so conveyed or devised to her shall cease and determine Sec 2271 If after the husbands death the widow accepts the provision made for her in lieu of dower she bars herself of dower but if she has re 1900 163 LAND V SHIPP6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ceived the provision during her Ihsbands life and has spent or wasted it she may take the dower as if it had not been made it is necessary in order to estop her that she should have enjoyed the provision or a part at least after her husbands death 5 Am  Eng Enc L 911 and authorities cited The deed of separation in this case contains none of the elements of a jointure It is nothing more nor less than an attempt to dissolve the marital relations between the parties to obtain from the wife a release directly to her husband of her inchoate right of dower in his estate and to place upon her the support of herself and the child of the marriage In the condition in which the wife was thereby placed the money consideration for entering into the contract was readily consumed in the use for the support of herself and child The wife being without power to make such a contract it is abso lutely void as to her and therefore does not bar her dower in the lands of which the husband was seized during the coverture Nor can she upon equitable grounds as is contended be re quired to refund the 400 paid her in lieu of her dower Her claim to dower is a common law right which she could enforce at law or in equity True she chose to assert her claim in a court af equity but she is not seeking equitable relief in the cancellation of a release or relinquishment of her dower She is entitled to dower in the estate of her husband to the extent to which she has not released or relin quished it in a manner authorized by law and her right is in no way affected by the deed of separation of June 27 1896 The learned judge of the court below having taken the view that appellant was not by reason of the deed of separation entitled to dower at all in the lands in question did not of course pass upon the character or extent of her dower interest therein She claims dower in the lands and in the proceeds from the sale of the timber received by appellee H E Shipp It is contended for her that as the debt secured by the trust deed upon the land made by the husband during the coverture in which she united had been satisfied her right of dower in the land was again in full vigor although the debt thereby secured was paid out of the proceeds from the sale of the land by the tustee in the subsequent deed of the husband in which the wife did not unite In this view we cannot concur The deed of separation being a nullity as to appellant her right of dower in her husbands estate at his death and now are the same as if it had never been en tered into That is to say the sale by the trustee in the subsequent July 164deed of trust given by the husband during the coverture did not affect appellants right of dower in the land to any further extent than a deed of conveyance by the husband to the purchaser would have affected her right When the deed of trust by the husband under which the land was sold was executed appellant held her inchoate right of dower in the equity of redemption in the land which was all the husband could convey to the trustee and upon the death of the husband this right of dower became consummate she not having released or relinquished it in any mode authorized by law Wheatleys Heirs v Calhoun 12 Leigh 280 and sec 2269 of the Code Sec tions 2277 and 2278 of the Code also apply The decree of the Circuit Court dismissing appellants bill will be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings therein in accordance with this opinion KEITH P concurs in the opinion of CARDWELL J Note by BUCIANAN and HARRISON JJ We concur in the opinion except so far as anything said therein may be construed as deciding to what extent a married woman re linquishes her right of dower when she unites with her husband in a deed of trust to secure a debt upon his real estate That question does not arise in this case and we do not wish to be understood as ex pressing any opinion upon it Reversed NOTEThe attention of the profession of the State is called to two import ant principles established in the excellent opinion of Judge Cardwell foregoing First That a contingent right of dower is not separate estate under chapter 103 of the Virginia Code and Second That under sec 2270 of the Code the  jointure  therein referred to as operating to bar dower does not include property in which a present estate is settled upon the wife but is confined to settlements to take effect at the death of the husband The language of sec 2270 is If any estate real or personal intended to be in lieu of dower shall be conveyed or devised for the jointure of the wife such conveyance or devise shall bar her dower of the real estate or the residue thereof and every such provision by deed or will shall be taken to be intended in lieu of dower unless the contrary inten tion plainly appear in such deed or will or in some writing signed by the party making the provision Unless the term jointure  here used be given its technical meaning as in the principal case the result would be that every gift from hus band to wife howsoever insignificant in value would operate under sec 2271 to put the wife to her election between such gift and her dower rights at the hus bands death The character of a contingent right of dower as an estate was discussed briefly in 5 Va Law Reg 529 In Sykes v Chadwick 18 Wall 141 the Supreme Court 1900 165 LAND V SHIPP166 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER July of the United States held that a contingent right of dower could not be regarded as separate estate under a statute declaring in substance that all property acquired by a married woman otherwise than by gift or grant from her husband should con stitute her separate estateand yet that having released such right in considera tion of a note executed to her by her husband and another the note became separate estate enforceable by her as a feme sole In other words as pointed out by Mr Justice Miller in his dissenting opinion the wife could make no contract except in connection with her separate estate If the contingent right of dower was not her separate estate the contract by which the makers of the note promised to pay her the amount named as consideration for the release was not a contract with reference to separate estate and therefore not enforceable by the wife in a sole suit So that while declaring in terms that the contingent right of dower was not separate estate the court in substance so treated it VIRGINIATENNESSEE COAL AND IRON CO V MCCLELLAND AND WIFE  Supreme Court of Appeals At

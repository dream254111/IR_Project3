Massachu setts College presidents too were numerous among the rest Dwight of Yale Gilman of Johns Hopkins Angell of Ann Arbor McCosh of Prince ton Adams of Cornell and the youthful head of old Bowdoin William De Witt Hyde of the Har vard class of 1879 The degree of doctor of laws was conferred on most of those who had not already received it and also on Leidy of Pennsyl vania Charles Deane of Cambridge and Gilder sleeve of Baltimore Mr Lowells oration contained that happy mix ture of wit and scholarly wisdom so essential to an interesting address As an example of this was the remark that the college buildings unlike those of the old country never looked old and never would Time refuses to console them he said 4 They all look as though they meant business and nothing more And it is precisely because this college meant business  business of the gravest import and did that business as thoroughly as it might with no means that were not niggardly except an abundant purpose to do its best it is precisely for this that we are gathered today Further on after describing the Puritan society of the early time Mr Lowell said  It was a com munity without charm or with a homely charm at best and the life it led was visited by no muse not even in dream but it was the stuff out of which fortunate ancestors are made and twenty five years ago their sons showed in no diminished measure the qualities of the breed But the por tion that aroused the most enthusiasm was at the close when he referred to the President of our country We have no politics here he said  but the sons of Harvard all belong to the party which admires courage strength of purpose and fidelity to duty    He has left the helm of state to be with us here and so long as it is in trusted to his hands we are sure that should the storm come he will say with Senecas pilot 0 Neptune you may save me if you will you may sink me if you will but whatever happens I shall keep my rudder true Coming after this oration Dr Holmess poem proved disappointing to many In the afternoon the alumni dined in the great hall and after satisfying the inner man as well as they could they listened to more speeches Especially deserving of remembrance was that of President Angell of the University of Michigan In brief he declared that all American colleges were indebted to Harvard for her brave experi mentations in college and university problems    Especially under the present vigorous administra CGE 451 tion there have been such exhaustive study and such courageous experimenting that the excite ment and stir have reached the remotest country college and the most secluded village academy   This has made an epoch Never before did the college and the people get so near together Those who do not accept the doctrines in favor here and those who do are alike indebted to you for we have all been stirred While the men were thus passing their time Mrs Eliot was introducing Mrs Cleveland to the ladies of Cambridge In the evening a public reception was held in the Hemenway gymnasium and the festival so happily conceived and so admir ably conducted was brought to a close Indeed perhaps not the least fruitful part of the whole celebration were the social relations which were begun or continued in the hospitable parlors of the college town NOTES AND NEWS THE semiannual meeting of the trustees of Princeton college last week was the occasion for the presentation of a report on the state of the college by President McCosh This year the col lege has more students than any previous year in its history Eightynine graduates are attending classes fifty of whom follow Dr McCoshs lectures on contemporary philosophy The trustees adopted a scheme similar to that in operation at Amherst and Harvard by which the students choose a standing committee to represent them in confer ences with the faculty This plan goes into effect at once The plans of President McCosh looking to the transformation of the college into a thoroughly equipped university were listened to with approval and referred to a special committee consisting of the standing committee on curricu lum and two other members of the board of trus tees  The following is a complete list of the papers entered to be read before the National sciences academy at the recent session in Boston Nov 9 11 S P Langley The solarlunar spectrum

college Appalachia vol i No 1 has been repub lished and copies will be furnished by the sales agents W B Clarke  Carruth Boston Mass The London literary journals announce that two interesting manuscripts have lately been pre sented to the British museum by her majestys consul at Chungking China The larger of the two fills seventythree folios and is in the Lolo character being written in verse of five characters NVCE VOL VIII No 198 to a line The smaller one is of thirteen folios and is in the writing of the Shinkia a Shan tribe of the southern portion of the province Kwei chow This is the first specimen of the writing of this tribe to reach Europe The characters are adaptations of contracted forms of an early kind of Chinese writing with an admixture of pic torial signs The work is one on divination each sentence closing with words of good or evil augury  Previous to 1879 typhoidfever was very prev alent in Vienna Austria At that time the drinkingwater was the water of the Danube In that year a new source for the citys water was drawn upon and since then the disease has very much decreased  The citizens and authorities of Chicago are very much interested at the present time in the solution of the problem of preventing the further contamination of the watersupply of that city The plan which seems to promise the best results is to divert all the sewage from the lake to the river and to pump from the river into the canal 12000 cubic feet per minute for every 1000 of the population The report of Dr Rauch submitted to the Illinois state board of health at its last meeting shows that by the adoption of such a plan the water of the lake would be in all respects adapted for domestic purposes and would be en tirely free from contamination while at the same time no contamination will result in the water of the river at points where other cities take their watersupply The Russian government is about to have constructed a petroleum pipeline with a capacity of 160000000 gallons of oil a year extending from Baku on the Caspian to the Black Sea a distance of about six hundred miles Mr Daniel G Brinton has been elected pro fessor of American linguistics and archeology in the University of Pennsylvania  A lady aged sixtytwo had for many years suffered from neuralgia of the face and ear and had also had an abscess form in the right ear She subsequently contracted what she supposed was a severe cold in the head and while blowing the nose forcibly expelled what proved to be a wis domtooth She remembered that some thirty years before she had suffered from cutting a wis domtooth but she was at that time relieved with out the appearance of the tooth It doubtless found its way upward into the upper jaw and finally liberated itself by ulceration through the nose in the manner described From a series of experiments by Zott ofNOVEMBER 19 1886 SCIE Munich it would appear that goldbeaters skin is a much better dialyzer than parchment paper so extensively employed for that purpose in chemi cal and other laboratories Taking goldbeaters skin as the unit Zott ascribes the following figures of effectiveness to the substances named gold beaters skin 1 sowbladder 07 parchment paper 05 leather 2 mm thick 002 caoutchouc 0001 Porous earthenware cells employed as dialyzers are but onesixtieth as effective as gold beaters skin T B Stowell PhD in a paper read before the American philosophical society has given in a most concise and thorough manner the anatomy of the trigeminous nerve of the domestic cat Dr Stowell has in this contribution to comparative neurology cleared up many points which have hitherto been obscure and has thus indirectly been of great service to students of human physi ology His paper on the vagus nerve in the same animal read before the same society some years ago was equally valuable and together they will have an important bearing on the future of neu rological science  Professor Vogel calls attention to the effect upon plants of growing them under unnatural con ditions He states the hemlock does not produce conine in Scotland and that the cinchona plants will not yield quinine when grown in hothouses He finds that tannin is produced in greatest quan tity in those which have had a full supply of direct sunlight  Dr Shoemaker of Philadelphia records in the Therapeutic gazette his experiences under the in fluence of ether In the first period which was brief and without excitement he was able to ask a rational question about the sheet with which he was to be covered but immediately thereupon control over the vocal apparatus was lost Of this he was conscious Then came the second or un conscious period Throughout this time there was present the single impression of two endless parallel lines in swift longitudinal motion each line being deflected at a certain point to form a wave All this was set on a misty background showing little of the lines at once though the lower line was clearly moving from left to right The lower line gave ascending waves which inter sected with the descending waves of the upper line There was also a low but distinct constant whir as if due to the running lines These lines occupied the whole mental field There were no visions no dreams of past experiences not even a conception as to what being it was that was re garding the two lines or that there was any such NCE 453 being All trace of personality was gone Then the lines began to move irregularly the patient drew a deep breath it dawned upon him that he was looking at the lines and the third period of recovery was begun Then came in an order which could not be remembered a series of curious impressions He felt that he had glimpsed the essential nature of human existence The lines were the existence of the soul of his soul and the waves were his animal life and were thus a temporary modification of a primary condition The idea was felt to be new and important and ought by all means to be remembered But the attempt was in vain there was a spiritual power controlling him and preventing it Though an unimaginative man it took days to shake off the feeling that another phase of existence had been revealed  The accompanying cut illustrates a meteoro logical observatory for automatic instruments erected by Mr W H Childs last May on Mount Wantastiquet over the eastern side of the Con necticut River opposite Brattleboro Vt It is 1060 feet above the river or about 1500 feet454 SCIE above sealevel The windvane turns the pointer on the dial seven feet in diameter so that the winddirection can be read with a glass from the town below The Robinson anemometer is con nected by wire with Mr Childs office where it has made continuous record since June 1 During the summer there has been a Draper thermograph belonging to the New England meteorological so ciety inside the shelter and a corresponding in strument belonging to Mr Childs in the town be low Next summer it is proposed to add selfre cording instruments of the Richardfreres pattern During the winter the weekly ascents of the mountain required for attention to the thermo graph have to be given up M Meguin claims to be able to determine the date of death by studying the generations of Acarina which have been at work upon the body Brouardel produced the cadaver of a young woman before the French academy of medicine which had lain in a cellar for a year He was able to trace five different species of Acarina and the order of succession and duration of each species He found dermestes sarcophagus lati crus and lucina cadaverina One species con sumes the fatty acids another absorbs the fluids and each dies when its work is ended The period of life of each in summer is from six to eight weeks In a case of murder in which the remains of the victim were discovered in a gar den Meguin was able to establish the date of burial with great accuracy The value of these observations and deductions if confirmed can not be overestimated as hardly a month passes without the discovery of a murdered body and in the course of the prosecution the probable date of death is always an important factor So far as we know no one has taken up this work of Me guin Brouardel and Laboutbene in this country and yet it would seem that no field offers more inducements to the medicolegal expert than the one just opened by these enterprising French savants Dr Lemuseau in Le moniteur du practicien gives a resurme of the progress made in the ex amination of blood and its detection during the last fifty years At the present time there are four methods employed for the determination of the presence of blood The first is that by means of the haematine crystals due to Teichman and improved by Struve and Morache The second method is spectroscopic examination The third is that of Taylor consisting in the employment of tincture of guaiacum which combined with the essence of turpentine or ozonized ether yields a beautiful blue color if blood be present The I AYCE VOL VIII No 198 fourth is microscopic examination In reference to the possibility of determining whether a given specimen of blood is human or not Vibet says it remains impossible to assert with positiveness that a bloodstain is formed of human blood It is in certain cases only admissible to say that it may be caused by human blood Sometimes it can be affirmed that the stain is of the blood of some other kind of marnmalia but not of man but in order to justify this opinion it will be neces sary that the bloodcorpuscles of the alleged animal be much smaller than those of man Dr Tipton of Selma Ala in the Sanitarian gives some very interesting facts and figures the result of his life among the blacks of the south He claims that their deathrate exceeds their birthrate the mortality being 30 per 1000 While during the slave state consumption was practi cally unknown now it is the principal factor in the diminution of the race Onehalf the male population is syphilitic and most of the women have uterine disease Hysteria rheumatism and alcoholism are common If Dr Tiptons opinions are correct it is only a question of time when the whole race becomes extinct unless by intermar riage with the wlhites the otherwise inevitable result is altered Even this will but postpone the blottingout of this people if disease prevails to the extent indicated  Lieutenant Yate who accompanied the AngloRussian boundary commission as a corre spondent has in press a book entitled England and Russia face to face in Asia It will describe the work of the boundary commission the topog raphy of the country and the character of the native tribes Lieutenant Yate is expected to throw new light on what the diplomatists unite in calling the  affair at Penjdeh LETTERS TO THE EDITOR The teaching of natural history IN the last numLer of Science A teacher com plains rather bitterly of your review of Frenchs  Butterflies and adds some comments on methods of instruction in natural history I have never had any experience as a teacher but the method of teach ing natural history has too much influence on the future growth of that science to fail to interest any naturalist even if he be unconnected with a school or college Without now inquiring whether the demand ex presses what is best for the advancement of knowl edge it seems to me that the actual demand of teachers and learners in entomology in this country is for a handbook of some group of insects on some such plan as is followed in Grays Manual of botany in which by analysis and by the characterization of each category of groups the relative affinities of the ob jects under treatment are throughout brought to

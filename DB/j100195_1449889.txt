j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1449889,Confession of Faith of the Almohades,i263125,360 The Jewish Quarterly Review Though therefore it is not absolutely certain that the anonymous Jewish sage whom Origen questioned concerning the Mosaic origin of the Psalms was Hoshaya as it might also have been Joshua ben Levi from whom we also have an utterance concerning these Psalms Shocher Tob Ps xc 1 and who used occasionally to visit Caesarea still after the arguments here adduced it is highly probable that personal intercourse took place between Hoshaya and Origen the fore most representatives of Judaism and Christianity in Caesarea W BACIIER III CONFESSION OF FAITII OF THE ALMOIIADES Professor Goldziher of Vienna has published in a recent number of the Zeitschrft of the German Oriental Society a short confes sion of faith composed for the Almohades or Unitarians by Muhammed Ibn Tumart of Magreb the founder of the sect In an earlier article 2 Prof Goldziher published and translated the Tauhid formula the Unitarian confession characterising it als Ausgangs punkt und gewissermassen Symbol einer der merkwiirdigsten Bewe gungen im magribinischen Islam immer werth dem Wortlaute nach bekannt und bewahrt zu werden Reference was made in the former article to a socalled  Murshida but Prof Goldziher could not state what was its exact nature3 He is now enabled to publish the Arabic text which exists among the Arabic MSS in the Royal Library at Berlin I am very glad indeed to give an English translation of the text The confession is interesting from many points of view It is interesting to the philosopher of religion as proving that while strict Monotheism is necessarily spiritual there is should be supplemented as follows NPlt l  Ul The saying springs out of a similar dictum by Joshua ben Levi in which the charge takes the followinIg form WDT nN1W NWh p D Un nllI 1ri i Dn3lD 2 D Ai1 About the term 11D see above The charge that the Jewish women in Egypt were faithless wives and cohabited with Egyptians was providentially confuted All the Jews born in Egypt showed unmistakably in their features that they were of pure Hebrew descent See also Levit rabba c 18 ad finel The lepers mentioned in Num v 2 were according to the Jlfidrasth so punished because they slandered Jewish families asserting that they were descended from lepers Vol XLIV page 168 2 Vol XLI page 72 3 Ad lo cit page 79Historical Nfotices 361 always a danger of its becoming Pantheistic It is interesting to the student of Jewish history as helping to explain how it was that during the Unitarian persecution Jews could easily become Moslems and how it came to pass that many who attributed conversion to one so great as Maimonides felt that he had committed no act which disgraced him The Moslem belief in the Unity of God is indeed as pure and as uncompromising as the Jewish The confession is in teresting to the student of the history of theology as showing that the nearness of religious belief is no safeguard against the spirit of persecution and it also brings very clearly before us that it must have been the determination to remain faithful to  historical Judaism rather than to adhere to certain dogmas or formulse which induced so many Jews to withstand the temptations to become followers of the  Apostle of God  in the latter half of the twelfth century The Confession of which I publish the translation is called the Murshida from the prayer  Arshadana llahu May God direct us in the right path with which it begins The title of the celebrated Caliph Haroun Arrashid will be familiar to the general reader as being connected with the same root I should like to call attention to the remarkable similarity there is between this formula and some of the Jewish hymns The well known Adon Olam in one verse takes up philosophical terms  There is no conjunction no separation and then speaks of God as the Re deemer that liveth In the MIurshida God is spoken of as  the Being of whom we can form no conception but still the most loving of rulers the tenderest of helpers without whose knowledge not even a leaf falls to the ground TRANSLATION In the name of God the Most Merciful the Most Gracious May Allah lead us and you in the right path Know ye then that it is absolutely necessary for every Muslim to know that God be he mag nified and extolled is One in his kingdom that he is the Creator of the whole Universe the heights and the depths the throne the heavens The Throne Two Arabic words are used here Arsh and Kursiu The worl Arskl is translated  throne but in a passage quoted in Lanes Arabic Lexicon page 2000 it is distinctly said that the Arsh of God is one of the things which mankind know not in reality but only by name If it were what the vulgar hold it to be it would be a support to God and not supported by him Maimon in his Letter of Consolation comments on the throne of Ezekiel i 22 and 2G in a similar fashion God carried the throne but the throne did not carry him JEWISH QUARTERLY Vol362 The Jewish Quarterly Reviewo and the earth and all that is in them and all that is between them All creation is subject to his power Not a mote is moved unless with his permission He has no counsellor in his kingdom no associate in the work of his creation He is living and ever existing To him appertaineth nlot slumber or sleep He knoweth that which is hidden and that which is seen Nought on earth or in heaven is concealed from him He knoweth that which is on dry land and that which is in the sea Not a leaf falls to the ground unless he knows it2 not a single grain in the darkest parts of the earth neither a green thing nor a dry thing that is not written in his clear book He comprehends all things with his knowledge He counts all things according to their number He doeth all that he desireth He hath power over all that he wisheth to perform To him is the kingdom to him belongeth wealth To him is power and might To him appertaineth eternity To him belongeth judgment lie maketh his decrees To him belong praise and adoration To him belong the best names3 None can hinder that which he decrees None can prevent that which he ordains He doeth in his creation that which he desires He hopes for no reward and fears no punishment He is subject to no decree to no judgment All his favours to us are acts of grace Every punishment he inflicts upon us is just None can say to him  What doest thou  but we can be asked as to our deeds He was before all Creation Of him we cannot attribute any direction in space He is not above us nor below us not at our right hand nor at our left not before us nor at our back The words whole and part II p 62 Some have made the distinction between Arsh and Kursiy by saying that Arsh is the highest sphere the empyrean and the Kurltsii is the sphere of the stars 1  He has no counsellor in his kingdom no associate in the work of his creation These words seem almost like an echo of Isaiah xl 13 11 2  Not a leaf falls to the ground    clear book This beautiful expression of the Omniscience of God is taken from The Qtran Stra 6 59 We might compare Matthew x 29 Beidhawi in his commentary on the passage leaves it open whether the clear book is to be taken figuratively as parallel with  God knoweth it or whether the clear book is not the same as the Lauh nl on which the divine decrees are ordained and which are sent down from heaven on the night of AlQadr during the Ramadhan Jews who know what is written about the book in which all events are written on the New Year will not assume that on account of such assertions IMuslims are blind fatalists 3 The  best names  are the ninetynine attributes of God which Muslims are in the habit of reciting They are given and

existeth He is the former of space the ordainer of time Time does not contain him Space does not hold him No intelligence can grasp him no intellect can comprehend him No imagination can characterise him No soul can form an image of his likeness Nought is like unto him But still be hears and he sees He is the tenderest of rulers the most loving of helpers Those who know him know him through his works but they deny all limit to his greatness However our imaginations may conceive God he the Exalted is different from our conception of him L M SIMMNONS

for war its signification had been forgotten by the Indians for was it not still the component element in a compound meaning war and warrior  This inference how ever was erroneous Since it is compounded with the verbstem keqte it must like on duta signify something which had to be borne on the back by the warrior Under the heading  Meubles mesnages outils  i e Family or household goods tools etc Fr Gabriel Sagard in his Dictionnaire de la Langue Huronne 1632 wrote Ballet Oscoera In the fifth edition of the  Dictionnaire de lAcademie Francoise Paris 1825 there are two forms of the word  ballet given one of these is balle signifying a large pack of goods bound with cords and wrapped in coarse linen cloth and the other is  ballot meaning a large pack or bundle of family or household goods The word bale is evidently the correct rendering of this word But it is very improbable that a bale as such formed a part of the family and household goodsand tools of the early Hurons It is likely however that oscoera signified a mat woven from the common Indian hemp Apocynum Cannabinum and thus merely a form of the modern Mohawk and perhaps proethnic oskara flax hemp tow the Tuskarora form of which is uskar  meaning shawl blanket bedding bedcover whatever is spread to lie upon being found in ydfkare nkua one uses it to spread which is a descriptive name of a carpet Father Bruyas on page 115 op cit has  Gentskaron estendre mettre la natte i e to spread or lay the mat or mattress and Gentskare S natte avoir une natte i e a mat to have a mat mattress Pbre Pierre Potier op cit has kaskcara tout ce qui sertf a coucheri e all that which is used for bed ding It is thus seen that the nounstem skar has the same meanings that ndut the stem of onduta has but it has a wider application in the modern vocabulary There is no attempt made here to connect these stems etymologically but a similar sematologic development only is shown in the two stems The stem of ka sken ra is sken r or better sken r In the stems skar and sken r we have two generic nounstems having the same consonnatic sounds sustaining one to the other the same positions in the two stems respectively but differing in the interconsonantic vowel which vocalizes them Nevertheless it is assumed that these two stems are derived from one and the same proethnic source It is clear that the stem skar is the older form in that it is the simpler of the two The change of the midstem vowel a to en is ex plained by the presence of the interrupted explosive repre sented by an apostrophe before a following r and by the presence of a k immediately before the vowel changed The cause of the change was the interrupted explosive which became a part of the stem by analogic metathesis a proced ure which is not unknown in this language So that there exists no formidable phonetic difficulty in the way of regard ing the two stems skar and sken r as derivatives from one and the same proetlmnic form having the meanings possessed by the stem skar already given above Thus it appears that kaskenra meant a mat or mattress and this is the meaning which is absolutely required by the verb stem keq te with which it is compounded Thus both the compoundstems ske ra kceqte and ndu takeqte were denotive of a custom of the Iroquoian war rior when on the warpath The pronominal prefixes have been suppressed for brevitys sake Prefixing the pronoun VOL XIX No 478 of the third person masculine singular of the anthropic gen der ro to the first we have roske  rakeqte he bears a mat on the back and ho a dialectic

consonant with the character of the journal The Bacillus of Influenza IN consequence of the inaccuracy of two articles which have recently appeared in Science on the subject of the bacillus of influ enza the undersigned considers it necessary to give the following de tailed abstract of the preliminary publications which have appeared this year in the Deutsche Medicinische Wochenschrift regarding the isolation and cultivation of this organism and its relation to the disease The bacillus of influenza was no doubt observed by Babes in 1890 but he describes a variety of other organisms as occurring in influenza and his communicAtions 1 2 show no more evidence than those of other authors of his having proved this or any other organism to be peculiar to the disease To the simultaneously published observations of Pfeiffer8 Kitasato4 and Canons we must look for definite information on this subject and to them most certainly is due the credit of discovery Where the bacillus of influenza is found The bacilli are found in large numbers in the sputa and bronchial secretion of those who are suffering from influenza and also to a greater or less ex tent in the blood The bacilli in the sputa have been obtained in pure culture after a new method by Kitasato and according to Pfeiffer their number in sputa bears a direct relation to the pro gress of the disease the bacilli disappearing together with the purulent bronchial secretion Pfeiffer suggests in view of this fact that the sputa be regarded as infectious material This au thor examined the purulent bronchial secretion of thirtyone cases of influenza and in all found the bacillus which will presently be described In uncomplicated Cases of influenza pure cultures of the organism were obtained He reports six autopsies in two of which he obtained pure cultures The bacilli occur in enormous numbers and frequently are observed in the pus cells The ex amination of the lungs showed that the bacilli penetrate from the bronchi into the peribronchial tissue and may even attain the pleural surface where in two of the autopsies the bacilli were obtained in pure cultures from the exsudate on the surface of the pleura In almost every one of twenty cases examined by Canon the characteristic bacilli were observed to be present in the blood see further under staining He usually found four to twenty isolated bacilli in each coverglass preparation In six cases where 1 Babes V Vorltufige Mittheilungen ueber einige bei Influenza gefun dene Bakterien Feb 17May 3 Centralbl f Bakteriol 1890 vol vii pp 288241 460464 496502

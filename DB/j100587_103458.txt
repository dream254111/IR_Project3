OF TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN CASTLE DOBBS SEPT 29 1725 I HERE SEND YOU AN ACCOUNT OF AN AURORA BOREALIS WHICH I SAW HERE THE 24TH 25TH AND 26TH INSTANT WITH REFLECTIONS UPON IT WHICH IF COMPARD WITH O THERS OR THE SAME VIEWD AT OTHER PLACES MAY IN SOME MEASURE CONTRIBUTE TO CLEAR UP THE NATURE OF IT I OBSERVD THAT THE THEATRE OF LIGHT FORMING AN IRREGULAR VARIABLE CURVE WAS AS AT MOST TIMES FORMER LY FROM E N E TO W N W THE HORIZON AND WHOLE HEMISPHERE SERENE LITTLE OR NO WIND WHAT THERE WAS SEEMD NORTHERLY THE SEEMING DAWN OR STAGE OF LIGHT GENERALLY CONTINUD IN AN IRREGULAR CURVE THE ONE POINT IN THE TWO FIRST NIGHTS WHILST I OBSERVD IT BEGAN NEAR THE HORIZON NEAR NNE THE OTHER POINT WAS AT WNW THE HEIGHT OF THE ARCH NOT EXCEEDING 20 DEGREES IN WHICH THERE SEEMD TO BE A CONTINUAL DAWN UNDER THAT FIELD OF LIGHT SEEMD TO BE A DARK CLOUD WHICH HOWEVER WAS A CLEAR SKY NOT FILLED WITH THAT LUMINOUS VAPOUR BECAUSE ALL THE STARS APPEARD DISTINCTLY AND TWINKLING THRO IT WHENEVER THAT LIGHT ROSE ABOUT 10 DEGREES HIGHER TO ABOUT 30 DEGREES THEN FLASHES OR CORUSCATIONS FOLLOWD AL TERNATELY AND SEEMED TO BE PILLARS OR BEAMS OF LIGHT WHICH FOLLOWD OR SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER AND BY THAT MEANS129 MEANS SEEMD TO MOVE AND CHANGE WITH ONE ANOTHER BY THE SUCCESSION OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS ACCORDING TO THE FLASHES WHEN THE LIGHTED VAPOUR ROSE HIGHER TO ABOUT 40 OR 45 DEGREES THEN THE APPEARANCE ALTERD AND INSTEAD OF BEAMS OR PILLARS OF LIGHT AS WHEN LOWER THERE WERE FLASHES LIKE THOSE ATTENDING EXPLOSI ONS WHEREIN FAINT COLOURS OF RED GREEN AND YEL LOW APPEARED BUT NOT VERY VIVID AND UPON EACH EX PLOSION IT WOULD SPREAD UPWARDS TOWARDS THE ZENITH IN THE APPEARANCE OF THIN ENLIGHTEND CLOUDS AND IM MEDIATELY DISAPPEAR ON THE 26TH ABOUT 9 AT NIGHT ONE OF THESE IRREGULAR ARCHES OF LIGHT HAD GOT UP TO THE ZENITH THE LOWER POINTS BEING NEAR E N E AND W S W I THEN SAW IT FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME AT LEAST A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND IT HAD BEEN THERE FOR SOME TIME BEFORE I SAW IT I COULD DISTINCTLY OBSERVE ALL THE DIFFERENT APPEARANCES ACCORDING TO ITS ALTITUDE IN THE HEMISPHERE VIZ THE LOWER PART BEING WITHIN 12 OR 14 DEGREES AS NEAR AS I COULD COMPUTE WAS A CON STANT FIXED LIGHT EQUAL TO THE LIGHT OF THE EDGE OF A WHITE CLOUD IN THE DAYTIME WHEN THE SUN SHINES ON IT AS IT ROSE HIGHER I COULD OBSERVE IT SOMEWHAT WEAK ER AND COULD PERCEIVE THE MOTION OF THE PILLARS OR BEAMS OF LIGHT AFTER EACH FLASH WHICH SEEMED BY THAT MEANS TO MOVE SOMEWHAT HIGHER AGAIN AT ABOUT 40 DE GREES THE FLASHES WERE LIKE EXPLOSIONS OF GREAT GUNS WITH THE FAINT COLOURS OBSERVED AS BEFORE BUT THE CORUSCATIONS OR FLASHES FROM THENCE TO THE ZENITH EX PANDED AT EVERY FLASH LIKE A BROAD THIN WHITE CLOUD OF WHICH SOME FAINT VIEW COULD BE SEEN AFTER EACH EXPLOSION FOR SOME TIME AND AFTER ALL THE EXPLOSIONS WERE OVER THERE REMAIND A THIN DUSKISH VAPOUR IN AND NEAR THE ZENITH AND ALL ALONG THE ARCH FROM EAST TO WEST FROM 14 TO 20 DEGREES BROAD WHICH UNDULA TED AND MOVD LIKE A STORMY SEA THE MOTION COMING FROM130 FROM THE SSE AND SO LESSEND TILL IT APPEARD NO BRIGH TER THAN THE MILKY WAY BUT MORE LIKE A VERY THIN CLOUD OR MIST THRO WHICH I COULD PERCEIVE THE STARS AT THE SAME TIME I SAW ANOTHER THIN CLOUD HAVING THE SAME APPEARANCE ARCHWAYS TO THE SOUTHWARD AT ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF 40 DEGREES WHICH I SUPPOSE HAD BEEN ANOTHER WHICH HAD BEEN OVER AND HAD MOVED THITHER FROM THE NORTHWARD BEFORE I WENT OUT AND DURING THE WHOLE TIME THERE WERE LESSER LIGHTS TOWARDS THE NORTH BUT DISPERSED HERE AND THERE AND NOT FORMING ANY LARGE BODY OF LIGHT DURING THE WHOLE TIME THE HEMISPHERE WAS CLEAR EXCEPT A FEW VERY SMALL CLOUDS NEAR THE HORIZON AND WHEN ANY MOVED INTO THE ENLIGHTEND ARCH THEY BROKE THE CON NEXION SO THAT THE LIGHT WAS ABOVE THEM AT THE SAME TIME IT FROZE HARD EACH NIGHT FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS I SUPPOSE THAT THE AURORA BOREALIS IS A THIN NITROSULPHUREOUS VAPOUR RAISD IN OUR ATMOSPHERE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE CLOUDS WHICH IS DISCONTINUED IN SEVERAL PLACES BY THE INTERSPERSD AIR AND WHICH BY PRESSURE AND MOTION IS KINDLED AND PERHAPS THE EXPLOSION OF ONE MAY BY ITS SHOCK AND MOTION CONTRIBUTE TO KINDLE THE NEXT BY WHICH MEANS THEY GO OFF ONE AFTER ANOTHER TILL THE WHOLE VAPOUR WITHIN THEIR INFLUENCE IS DISCHARGED AND THEN THE LIGHT DISAPPEARS AND THE THIN SMOAK APPEARS AND UNDULATES ACCORDING TO THE MOTION IN THAT PART OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND HENCE I THINK MOST OF THE APPEAR ANCES MAY BE SOLVD FOR 1ST AS TO THE CONTINUD LIGHT NEAR THE HORIZON THEY BEING AT A GREAT DISTANCE FROM US AND NEARLY IN A LINE ALL THESE EXPLOSIONS MAY SEEM AS A CONTINUED LIGHT WHEN THESE APPROACH NEA RER TO US AND BY CONSEQUENCE APPEAR HIGHER IN OUR HEMISPHERE WE OBSERVE THE MOTION IN EACH FLASH AND STILL SEEING THEM LATERALLY YET SOMEWHAT BREAKING THE CON131 CONTINUITY OF THE LIGHT THEY BY THE REFLECTION OF THE VAPOUR FLOATING IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND BEING NOT REFLECTED WHERE THE AIR BETWIXT THEM IS FREE OF THOSE VAPOURS MAY APPEAR AS PILLARS AND AS THE FLASH BE LOW AND BEYOND THEM MOVES AS IT KINDLES AND EX PANDS SO THEY SEEM TO MOVE AND PERHAPS ARE SHOCKD AT THE SAME TIME BY THE MOTION BUT AFTERWARDS WHEN THEY ARE NEARERAND RAISED TO THE ALTITUDE OF 40 DEGREES WE GET SOMEWHAT UNDER THEM AND SEE THE EXPANSION OF THE EXPLOSION WHICH APPEARING SOMEWHAT GLOBULAR GIVES THE FAINT COLOURS OBSERVED ABOVE THE LIGHT NOT BEING INTENSE ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM VIVID AND AFTER WARDS WHEN THEY RISE TO OR NEAR THE ZENITH THEY ARE NIGHEST TO US AND THEN EXPAND VERY WIDE AT EACH FLASH LIKE LITTLE CLOUDS AND I THINK THE GREAT OBJECTION OF THEIR APPEARING IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE HEMI SPHERE AND SELDOM OR NEVER IN THE SOUTHERN IS IN SOME MEASURE ANSWERD BY THE APPEARANCE ON THE 26TH SINCE AT LEAST HALF OF THE ARCH WAS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE HEMISPHERE AND PERHAPS THE REASON WHY THE LIGHT IS NOT SEEN NEAR THE HORIZON IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE HEMISPHERE MAY BE THIS THAT IN CLEAR SE RENE WEATHER THE WIND BEING GENERALLY NEAR THE NORTH OBJECTS FROM THENCE ARE MUCH MORE DISTINCTLY VIEWD AND AT A GREATER DISTANCE THAN FROM THE SOUTH AND TIS GENERALLY KNOWN THAT LANDS AT A GREAT DISTANCE ARE MOST DISTINCTLY SEEN WHEN THE WINDS BLOW FROM THEM AND PERHAPS A COLD NORTHERLY FREEZING AIR MAY BE NEEDFUL TO KINDLE THE VAPOURS WHEN A CONTRARY MOTION ABOVE HIGHER IN THE ATMOSPHERE MAY CAR RY THE SULPHUREOUS VAPOUR WHICH FALLING DOWN FROM THE NITROUS VAPOUR MAY BE KINDLED WHICH I SUPPOSE FORM THE UNDULATIONS OF THE SMOAK AFTER THE EX132 EXPLOSION WHICH SEEMED AS ABOVE LIKE A STORMY SEA MOVING FROM THE SSE NOTE THE BAROMETER WAS LOW FOR SOME DAYS BEFORE AND AFTER IT I AM C ARTHUR DOBBS

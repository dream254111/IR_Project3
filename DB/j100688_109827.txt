J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109827,ON THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE POLARIZATION OF LIGHT BY REFLECTION FROM TRANSPARENT BODIES ABSTRACT,I207044,14 ON THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE POLARIZATION OF LIGHT BY REFLECTION FROM TRANSPARENT BODIES BY DAVID BREWSTER LLD FRS EDIN AND FSA EDIN IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JO SEPH BANKS BART KB PRS READ MARCH 16 1815 PHIL TRANS 1815 P 125 THOUGH HUYGENS WHO FIRST EXPLAINED THE LAWS THAT REGULATE THE EXTRAORDINARY REFRACTION OF LIGHT AT A SURFACE OF ICELAND SPAR DISCO VERED THAT LIGHT THUS SEPARATED HAS PROPERTIES DIFFERENT FROM COMMON LIGHT AND THOUGH NEWTON OBSERVED THAT LIGHT THUS MODIFIED HAS PER MANENT PROPERTIES WITH REFERENCE TO THE PLANE IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN RE FRACTED AND EXPRESSED THIS PECULIARITY BY SAYING THAT THESE RAYS HAVE SIDES ACCORDING TO WHICH ITS SUBSEQUENT REFRACTIONS ARE REGULATEDIT WAS MALUS WHO GAVE TO THIS MODIFICATION THE NAME OF POLARIZATION A TERM BY WHICH HE COULD CONVENIENTLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS AFFECTIONS WHICH SUCH LIGHT UNDERGOES BY REFRACTION OR REFLECTION IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND COULD THEREBY MOST DISTINCTLY DESCRIBE THE VARIOUS PHENOMENA RELATING TO HIS IMPORTANT DISCOVERY THAT LIGHT MAY ALSO BY REFLECTION ACQUIRE THE SAME PROPERTIES THAT ARE GIVEN BY REFRACTION THROUGH ICELAND SPAR AND OTHER DOUBLY REFRACTING CRYSTALS MALUS ASCERTAINED THAT WHEN LIGHT IS INCIDENT ON THE SURFACE OF WATER AT A CERTAIN ANGLE THAT PORTION OF IT WHICH IS REFLECTED IS COM PLETELY POLARIZED AND THAT WHEN LIGHT IS INCIDENT ON THE SURFACE OF OTHER MEDIA THE ANGLE AT WHICH COMPLETE POLARIZATION OF THE REFLECT ED PORTION TAKES PLACE WILL BE DIFFERENT BEING GREATER WHEN THE RE FLECTING SUBSTANCE HAS A HIGHER REFRACTIVE BUT MALUS DID NOT SUC CEED IN DETECTING THE RULE BY WHICH THE REQUISITE ANGLES OF INCIDENCE FOR DIFFERENT BODIES COULD BE INFERRED FROM THEIR REFRACTIVE POWERS DR BREWSTER HAS BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS INQUIRY AND THE RESULT OF HIS OBSERVATIONS NOW COMMUNICATED IS THAT THE ANGLES OF INCIDENCE AT WHICH THE MAXIMUM OF POLARIZATION IS AFFECTED BY ALL SUBSTANCES HE HAS EXAMINED ARE SUCH THAT TANGENT OF INCIDENCE IS TO RADIUS AS SINE OF INCIDENCE TO SINE OF REFRACTION OR AS HE EXPRESSES IT TANGENT OF INCIDENCE IS EQUAL TO THE INDEX OF REFRACTION AND SINCE TANGENT IS RADIUS  SINE COSINE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE ANGLE OF REFRACTION IS THEN COMPLEMENT TO THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE OR THEIR SUM IS A RIGHT ANGLE AND HENCE THE REFLECTED RAY FORMS A RIGHT ANGLE WITH THE REFRACTED RAY AT EMERGENCE ALSO FROM A DENSE MEDIUM THE PART REFLECTED WILL BE MORE OR LESS POLARIZED AND THE MAXIMUM OF POLARIZATION WILL BE FOUND AS BEFORE TO OCCUR WHEN THE ANGLES OF INCIDENCE AND EMER GENCE ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO EACH OTHER OR WHEN THE REFLECTED POR TION MAKES A RIGHT ANGLE WITH THE REFRACTED RAY HENCE IN POLA RIZATION BY A PLATE OF GLASS OF WHICH THE SURFACES ARE PARALLEL IF THE INCIDENCE ON THE FIRST SURFACE BE SUCH AS TO POLARIZE THE REFLECTED RAY THE PORTION REFLECTED FROM THE SECOND SURFACE WILL BE POLARIZED AT THE SAME TIMEA FACT WHICH MALUS HAD OBSERVED BUT ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF UNABLE TO EXPLAIN DR BREWSTER FURTHER OBSERVES THAT IT IS ACCORDING TO THE SAME15 LAW THAT THE MAXIMUM OF POLARIZATION TAKES PLACE IN REFLECTION FROM THE JOINT SURFACE OF TWO MEDIA THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE IS COMPLE MENT TO THE ANGLE OF REFRACTION OR THE TANGENT OF INCIDENCE AS THE AUTHOR EXPRESSES IT IS EQUAL TO THE QUOTIENT OF THE INDICES OF REFRAC TION OF THE MEDIA AFTER DESCRIBING IN A SERIES OF PROPOSITIONS THE VARIOUS DEGREES IN WHICH LIGHT BECOMES POLARIZED BY REFLECTION OR REFRACTION AT DIFFERENT ANGLES AND THE NUMBER OF REFLECTIONS OR REFRACTIONS NECESSARY TO EFFECT COMPLETE POLARIZATION AT VARIOUS ANGLES REMOTE FROM THAT WHICH PRODUCES THE MAXIMUM THE AUTHOR INVESTIGATES THE ORIGIN OF A CER TAIN QUANTITY OF UNPOLARIZED LIGHT WHICH EXISTS EVEN AT THE MAXIMUM POLARIZING ANGLE IN REFLECTION FROM SUBSTANCES OF HIGH REFRACTIVE POWER AND HE SHOWS IT TO DEPEND ON THE DIFFERENT REFRANGIBILITY OF DIFFERENTLY COLOURED LIGHT FOR WHEN THE INCIDENCE IS SUCH THAT THE MEAN REFRANGIBLE RAYS ARE COMPLETELY POLARIZED IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE INCIDENCE WILL NOT BE SUCH AS TO POLARIZE COMPLETELY EITHER THE RED OR THE VIOLET RAYS AND CONSEQUENTLY A BEAM COMPOSED OF THESE WILL APPEAR AS WHITE LIGHT NOT POLARIZED AND WHEN THE POLARIZATION IS EFFECTED AT THE SURFACE OF SUBSTANCES OF HIGH REFRACTIVE AND DISPERSIVE POWER THIS PORTION WILL FORM A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE WHOLE RE FLECTED LIGHT ON THE CONTRARY ANY PENCIL OF HOMOGENEOUS COLOURED LIGHT THOUGH ONLY ONCE REFLECTED MAY BE COMPLETELY POLARIZED EVEN AT THE SURFACES OF THE DENSEST SUBSTANCES IF INCIDENT AT AN ANGLE COR RECTLY ADAPTED TO ITS REFRANGIBILITY THE AUTHOR PURPOSES ON SOME FUTURE OCCASION TO POINT OUT THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE POLARIZATION OF LIGHT UNDER VARIOUS OTHER CIR CUMSTANCES NOT NOTICED IN THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION ON SOME PHENOMENA OF COLOURS EXHIBITED BY THIN PLATES BY JOHN KNOX ESQ COMMUNICATED BY THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART GCB PRS READ APRIL 6 1815 PHIL TRANS 1815 P 161 IT IS NOT SURPRISING SAYS THE AUTHOR THAT NEITHER SIR ISAAC NEWTON NOR DR HERSCHEL NOR ANY OTHER WRITER WHO HAS FOLLOWED ON THE SAME SUBJECT HAVE GIVEN ANY EXPLANATION WHICH APPEARS TO HIM TO BE SA TISFACTORY SINCE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IN POSSESSION OF THE PHENOMENA CONNECTED WITH THIS INQUIRY AFTER STATING VARIOUS OBJECTIONS WHICH HE CONSIDERS AS CONCLUSIVE AGAINST THE ALTERNATE DISPOSITION TO BE RE FLECTED OR TRANSMITTED INHERENT IN THE RAYS OF LIGHT AND RECURRING AT CERTAIN EQUAL INTERVALS WHICH ARE EXPRESSED UNDER THE NAME OF FITS BY SIR ISAAC NEWTON MR KNOX PROCEEDS TO DESCRIBE THOSE NEW PHE NOMENA WHICH FORM THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECT OF HIS PAPER AND WHICH HE HAS BEEN ENABLED TO MAKE BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE METHOD OF OB SERVING SUCH APPEARANCES EMPLOYED BY DR HERSCHEL THIS METHOD CONSISTS IN USING THE SHADOWS OF SOME OPAKE SUBSTANCE HELD OVER THIN PLATES OF GLASS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISTINGUISHING FROM EACH OTHER THE SEVERAL EFFECTS PRODUCED BY DIFFERENT SURFACES EMPLOYED AT THE SAME TIME IF A PLATE OF UNSILVERED GLASS BE LAID UPON A TABLE BEFORE

j100358,The School Review,1078191,A New Elementary French Text,i244748,A new elementary French textAn elementary French text by Arthur G Bovye represents a gradual evolution It has evidently been developed in the classroom in accordance with all that is best in modern language teaching Typographically it is a superior product The pagination has been skil fully done the print is clear and the binding is solid This meets about all of the requirements for a school text It is possible that it may contain some errors but none were detected as the book was examined for the purposes of this review ARTHUR GIBBON BovEE Premiere Annie de Franpais Boston Ginn  Co 1922 Pp xx54636 1641922 EDUCATIONAL WRITINGS 629 As pointed out in the Preface the language is treated as a means of express ing human thought Consequently the author has made the thought the unit rather than the individual word In applying this principle the subjectmatter which is concrete is developed in connected thought groups which lend them selves readily to dramatization By the process of multiple associations the material is learned more easily and with a much better chance of retention The vocabulary seems intensely practical consisting of approximately 1500 words among which are found the 500 most important words indicated by Thorndike in The Teachers Word Book The author claims that the vocab ulary develops and unfolds logically and in perfect sequence in the same way as propositions in geometry which makes for perfect enchainement He has certainly been very consistent in the application of this principle In addition to wellchosen words there is a wealth of idiomatic French which contrasts strikingly with many translation books where the sentence structure often parallels the English Though the acquisition of a good vocabulary for reading purposes is the objective of the book grammar is not neglected It is caught through usage rather than taught by rule It is not merely explained but is taught by an abundance of repetition in varied constructions and new combinations Many rules are both simplified and unified by the application of phonetic laws Phonetics is an integral and organic part of the book The result must be a good pronunciation as well as a better appreciation of the language The common mistake of placing a phonetic hors doeuvre at the beginning of the book never or rarely to be referred to again has been wisely avoided As far as the arrangement of the material is concerned the book is rather unusual It is divided into lessons called Classes Each lesson is the faith ful record of what takes place in the classroom during the recitation It is in the form of a class program one for each day in the year Obviously there will be an economy of time for the experienced teacher Besides it furnishes a guide to the new teacher Furthermore since the teachers explanations become the home reading of the pupils what is apparently an oral method becomes in effect a prereading course of 250 pages The technique which the author has used has produced a definite result The subjectmatter of the whole book is logically knit together The lesson of today grows out of the lesson of yesterday and is a steppingstone to the lesson of tomorrow The known is used to explain the unknown and is constantly reworked with it The process resembles a piece of weaving rather than a series of watertight compartments In fact the author seems to stress con stantly the point of enchainement This text warrants serious consideration Not only is it based on sound principles of language pedagogy but it also takes account of the psychology of language learning In respect to the treatment of pronunciation vocabulary and grammar the book represents a decided advance in methods of modern language teaching JAMEs L BARKER UNIVERSITY OF UTAH

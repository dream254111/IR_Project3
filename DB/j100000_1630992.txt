classification of the bacteria presents peculiar difflculties for several reasons Mor phological distinctions are so slight that phys iological characters must necessarily be in voked in order to separate and classify the various organisms and these physiological characters are often variable Pathogenicity may be taken asta type of those powers of the organism which are Eeasily and profoundly modified by external conditions On the other hand there are numerous characters which ap pear to be extremely constant Such minute dif3erences as occur in the resistance of dif ferent races to unfavorable conditions often remain unchanged through long periods of cul tivation In using these constant characters for classification we are met by another diffl culty Though constant the diferences are  Preliminary communication From the Bio logical laboratories of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 669 very minute and in studying a number of organisms a perfect gradation is often found between the widest extremes This is es actly what should be e2rpected from organ isms which reproduce only by asesual method3 since it is the fusion of independent cells which swamps minor diferences producing the uniformity of species among higher plants With asesual reproduction every minute varia tion which is inheritable must persist un changed until some other chance variation occurs iEach such variation means a new and diferent type of bacterium The immense number of generations which may succeed each other sn a short space of time makes boundary lines as shifting as they would become among the higher plants if a dozen geological epochs were considered all at once Since with unicellular organisms acquired characters may probably be inherited in a higher degree than with other forms existing races of bacteria will be markedly influenced by the selective eect of environmental con ditions and must bear the impress of their recent history There are therefore no species among the bacteria in quite the sense in which we or dinarily use the wordas indicating a group of individuals bound together by a number of constant characters and easily identified by nutual ertility From one point of view each distinct race lnight be considered a spe cies but to apply a name for every grade of difference in each varying character vwould be impracticable and such names could have no true specific value The best solution of the difflculty is the establishment of certain types around which the individual organisms may be more or less closely grouped but it must be clearly recogllized that the groups thus formed are defined by relation to the type at their center and are not sharply marked of3 at their extremities from the other groups adjacent It is impossible to make a natural classiSca tion of the bacteria which shall be a true es pression of phylogeny by considering a single character at a time for example by dividing a group dichotomously first according to mor6o SCIENCE N S VOL XXI NO 539 phology then according to liquefaction etc IJarger groups at least should manifestly be lndicated by the collocation of several char tacters the association of any two of which markedly strengthens their significance By applying this principle Sve fairly wellmarked genera of coccaceae may be distinguished Iour of these Sarcina Micrococcus Strepto coccus and Ascococcus date back to the early days of bacteriology although the latter term has fallen into disuse The mere property of zooglea formation should not be considered of generic importance but the few peculiar species which are capable of growing under purely saprophytic conditions and producing large gelatinous masses are so far marked of Sfrom other cocci as to warrant in our judg ment the retention of Cohns genus The genera Micrococcus Streptococcus and Sarctna are retained since in them morphological dif ferences appear to be correlated with dier fences in biochemical characters or habitat and we have considerably enlarged the definitions of these genera to include physiological and tecological factors With regard to the genus Diplococctis suggested by Weichselbaum for the parasite of pneumonia it should be remem bered that any coccus may at times occur in pairs Yet those organisms which are strictly parasitic and which normally occur only in ag gregations of two cells appear to mark a valid group The morphological character of a sgenus must never be too rigidly interpreted DIt refers to the typical and most commonly Ncharacteristic growth forms and other groupings may at times occur Therefore we recognize five genera based in each case on a more or less constant association of sev eral independent characteristies The old genera Merispomedia and Staphylococcus are merely synonyms of Cohns Micrococcus and Ascococcus antedates Leuconostoc Fischers characterization of Pediococcus by regular division into two sections at right angles to each other rests upon a variable and thor oughly artificial character and probably in cludes some species of Hficrococcus and some imperfectly studied species of iSarcina With regard to the genera Ptanosarcia and Planococc us founded upon the single char acteristic of the possession of flagella there may be more uncertainty The slow revolu tion and steady translation observed by Ali Cohen and Migua as associated with flagella is certainly a phenomenon distinct frozll the irregular vibratory and rotary movement3 noted by other observers but the resemblance between motile and nonmotile forms is so close in all other characters that we can not consider this single property to be of generic im ortance  The Sve genera above mentioned have been discussed Srst because their characteristics are already somewhat familiar but in logical order the larger subdivisions should have been previously considered The family Coccacese although defined only by the spherical form of the individual is a thoroughly satisfactory natural group its members being also marked of3 in certain physiological characters from individuals of other groups The family appears to be divisible into two subfamilies The first for which we suggest the name Paracoccacex paratrophic cocci includes DtpEococcus and Streptococcus parasitic forms which do not develop abundant growth on artificial media and nThich thrive better under anaerobic than under aerobic conditions and appear in small cell aggregates of pairs or chains The second subfamily the Metacoccacese meta trophic cocci includes Micrococcus Sarcina and Ascococcus saprophytic or semisapro phytic types which are aerobic and form abundant surface growths of large cell groups The species of the coccacea3 are consider ably more obscure We have reviewed the descriptions of 445 supposedly distinct species given by Cohn Migula iFlugge Chester Sternberg ljehmann and Neumann iEngler F  and Prantl Rabenhorst Frankland and Woodhead and find a wonderful amount of duplication Our observations have con vinced us that minute differences in mor phology as for example the distinction be tween large and small cells or long and short chains are not sufficiently constant for the erection of speciS Again slight differences in the appearance of colonies on gelatin which orma large number of German species vary1 SCIENCE WAPRIL 28 1905

turbidity later settles to form sediment and those constant differ vences wllich do exist appear to be connected with the size of the cell aggregates Organ isms growing in large groups like most of

Nahrsto agar are correlated witll the general vigor of a particular race and vary ularkedly Temperature relations Xare sisnilarly inconstant and what marked differences exist are correlated with other

then for the establishment of species the relation of the organism to gelatin its action upon sugars its pigment production and its power to form nitrites and indol In regard to all these points much more thorough study is needed In particular almost no tdata exist with regard to indol and nitrite production By using the first three char acters with one or two others which are o im portance in special cases we have made a tentative division of the 445 described forms lmder thirtyone types A careful comparison eOf the published descriptions furnished no evi fdence for more true species and 85 cultures isolated from various sources and obtained from the principal American laboratoriGs which we have studied in considerable detail fall naturally under some one of the types sestablished S

formed Two species are distinguished A mesen teroides Cienkowski a nonliquefying form and A nxucilaginosus Migula a liquefier The characters of the species tentatively de fined above are still somewhat artificial and may be subject to revision and modification when our studies are complete It is prob able that the liquefaction of gelatin can not bear any very direct relation to phylogeny since in every genus except Dtplococcus and in each subdivision of a genus a liquefying and a nonliquefying form occur parallel to each other Synonymy will be discussed in our full com munication later but we have strictly followed the rules of priority as recognized in other fields of systematic biology In reviewing our genera a serial arrange ment is at once apparent Diplococcus is strictly parasitic and commonly produces onlgf aggregates of two cells Streptococcqbs also normally parasitic thrives better though still not luxuriantly on artificial media and its typical growthform is a chain Micrococcus includes both pathogenic and nonpathogenic forms but all grow abundantly on gelatin and agar in rather large irregular cell aggregates while some produce acid and some alkalies in miLk Sarcina shows further development in the same direction its growth form being larger and produced by three planes of divi sion its saprophytic habit being more marked no truly pathogenic forms known to exist with the power of acid production generally wanting Ascococcus in spite of its slight acid production and chain formation appear3 on the whole to form the extreme of this series since its entirely saprophytic existence and large vegetative growthforms are far removed from the pathogenic micrococci The genera above defined seem to mark the important transition stages beginning with such strict parasites as D WeichseZbaumii and ranging through the intermediate forms of Strep tococci Micrococci and Sarcinae to the sapro phytic Ascococcus wLesenteroides at another estreme We believe that these genera hav true phylogenetic sipificance and represent real groups of organisms having natural affinities aE A WINSLOW ANNE F ROGERS

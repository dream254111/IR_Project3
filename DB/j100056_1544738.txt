j100056,American Fern Journal,1544738,American Fern Society,i269021,AMERICAN FERN SOCIETY introduced by a florist here and there is a beautiful vine growing in the place where the greenhouses were origin ally It has been suggested that the spores of the fern may have been brought from Japan in rice The ferns grow ing in Charleston were undoubtedly introduced by a florist but it seems unlikely that those growing in Sum merville thirty miles away owe their origin to the same source A friend who has spent many years in Japan writes that she has found the Lygodium japonicum in a half dozen places around Kamahura growing generally in the long bamboo grass on the edge of a pine wood on a sandy hillside where it climbs up the grass stems or trails on the ground The fern is not cultivated in Japan nor used ornamentally as one or two native ferns areMARY L ANDERSON LAMBERTVILLE N J American Fern Society Charles Noyes Forbes Curator of Botany in the Bernice Pauahi Bishop of Museum Polynesian Eth nology and Natural History Honolulu died at his home in Honolulu on August 10 1920 Mr Forbes was born at Boylston Massachusetts September 24 1883 Following his elementary training he attended the Fay school Southboro Massachusetts 18951897 and the High School at National City California In 1908 he was graduated from the Uni versity of California with the degree of Bachelor of Science Soon after Mr Forbes came to the Bishop MIuseum as Assistant in Botany and was later appointed Curator of Botany During his twelve years on the staff of the Museum Mr Forbes developed a small miscellaneous collection 91AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL of plants into an excellent herbarium of the Hawaiian flora a considerable part of which is the product of his skillful field work Plans to extend Mr Forbes studies to Samoa and Tonga where he was to have made a botanical survey for the Bayard Dominick Expedition were unfortunately rendered impossible by his death In addition to his exacting routine duties as Curator Mr Forbes has contributed 12 articles to the Occasional Papers of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum of Polyne sian Ethnology and Natural History His last work is a paper on Salient Features of Hawaiian Botany which forms part of the Proceedings of the First Pan Pacific Scientific Conference held in Honolulu August 2 to 20 1920 A review of Mr Forbes work reveals an enthusiastic and courageous devotion to the cause of science re markable in view of his continuous poor health and re sulting in valuable contributions to the knowledge of Polynesian botany

Scientific Conference Honolulu T H August 1920 Mrs Emily Hitchcock Terry a member of the Amer ican Fern Society since 1893 died in the Dickinson Hospital at Northampton Mass February 6 1921 after an illness of about a year Mrs Terry was the youngest daughter of President Edward Hitchcock of Amherst College and was born in the Presidents house at Amherst Massachusetts November 9 1837 She graduated from Mount Holyoke College in the class of 1859 and soon after married the Reverend Cassius M Terry After the death of Mr Terry in Minnesota Mrs Terry returned to Northamp ton and became matron of Hubbard House Smith Col lege She held this position for twentyfive years and after her retirement continued to live in Northampton the remaining eight years of her life During all this time she exerted a strong influence in the college and community Mrs Terry was an accomplished botanist and made some very interesting discoveries of plants new to New England and of new stations for rare plants Her her barium of flowering plants and a remarkable series of paintings of wild flowers made by her in early life were presented to Smith College Her special interest and study however was ferns She early formed a friend ship with Mr George B Davenport and in her little fern garden in front of Hubbard House she had growing some of the rarest of American ferns which Mr Daven port had given her Among these were Aspidium spinulosum variety concordianum Davenp Eastman Aspidium pittsfordense Slosson later found to be a hybrid between A spinulosum 0 F Mueller Sw and A marginale L Sw and Dicksonia punctilobula 93AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL Michx Gray forma cristata Maxon Clute When she gave up her home at Hubbard House these ferns she passed on to the writer She was very fond of the Vermont country and spent many summers in Hartland Pittsford Bennington and Dorset She was an intimate friend of the late Miss G A Woolson and Miss Margaret Slosson and with them had botanized extensively in Pittsford Her favorite botanizing ground however was Dorset Here she and Mr Allan Bourn made many interesting finds As a result of her botanizing in Dorset she published in the Fern Bulletin for January 1898 a brief article on Dorset ferns This region she regarded as one of the most prolific in the country where in a two hours walk she could bring home thirtyseven species and varieties This article was supplemented by another in the July 1905 issue of the same magazine More about the Ferns of Dorset  At this time she increased her original list to fiftythree species and varieties A few years before she died Mrs Terry made a collec tion of the ferns of Dorset This collection was carefully mounted by her and is now preserved in the village library in Dorset where it will be available to allH G RUGG Miss Nellie Mirick in a recent letter to the Treasurer makes mention of the fact that she has been a member of the Society twentyfive years This has led to a cen sus of the members who joined during the first three years of the Societys life and are still on our rolls There are eleven in all First come the three charter members Prof Clute the founder Prof Petty and Dr Waters Miss Elmira Elsie Noyes joined in 1893 but not as a charter member After her come Miss Dora Radlo 1894 our President and Miss Harriet Wheeler 1895 and besides Miss Mirick Mrs M A Noble Charles 0 Rhodes and D Leroy Topping in 1896 We 94AMERICAN FERN SOCIETY wish to congratulate them all and still more heartily to congratulate the Society on their continued interest and service in it In connection with the Fern Exhibit of the Mass Horticultural Society there was called a meeting of the members of the American Fern Society living in and near Boston About twenty members were present with Mr Wm R Maxon President in the chair Mr Maxon was president in connection with the Fern Ex hibit for which he had been asked to serve as one of the judges Dr Benedict was in charge of the exhibit sent by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden he also delivered an illustrated lecture on ferns and prepared a pamphlet on cultivated ferns which was distributed by the Horti cultural Society to persons attending the exhibit Miss Marshall and the other two editors were also present so that the officers were pretty well represented The meeting included a discussion of various items connected with the increase in membershipthe So ciety has now for the first time reached the mark of three hundred members and is still growing Mrs Scott suggested that members locally might well en deavor to interest their park authorities in establishing plantations of local hardy ferns both for their beauty and to educate the public to a better knowledge of these plants The question of enlarging the scope of the American Fern Journal by endeavoring to secure more articles on various greenhouse ferns especially those which are valuable as house plants was discussed It was pointed out that even if we were disposed to interpret with en tire strictness the statement on our stationery that the Society is devoted particularly to the study of native ferns the tropical ferns of Porto Rico Panama and the Philippines might now be said to be natives of the United States 95AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL Quite aside from this Mr Maxon called the attention of the members to a series of herbarium specimens of beautiful tropical ferns not now in cultivation and which possess elements of marked beauty surpassing many of those now in the trade Species of Anemia Elapho glossum Polybotrya a miniature tree fern from Cuba of perfect proportion but like an umbrella in size were among the specimens shown It is Mr Maxons hope that on some of his future trips to the tropics he may be able to make arrangement for the introduction of some of these plants Following the informal meeting the members met in formally for supper The Judge of Elections reports the reelection of the present officers by a vote of 85 to 0 in each case Mr Nathaniel T Kidder Milton Mass would be glad to hear from anyone who has for sale any of the first 12 numbers of the Fern Bulletin except no 9 and Vol 4 except no 2 Mr W R McColl

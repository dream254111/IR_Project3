C A J A BRAUNIO ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM MEMBRO C BY WILLIAM WATSON M D R S S,I206917,AN ACCOUNT OF A TREATISE IN LATIN PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTITULED DE ADMIRANDO FRIGORE ARTIFICIALI QUO MERCURIUS EST CONGELATUS DISSERTATIO C A J A BRAUNIO ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM MEMBRO C BY WILLIAM WATSON M D R S S TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY GENTLEMEN VERY EARLY LAST YEAR WE WERE IN FORMED THAT AT PETERSBURG BY THE MEANS OF ARTIFICIAL COLD THE MERCURY IN THERMO METERS HAD BEEN CONDENSED TO SO GREAT A DEGREE AS TO BECOME PERFECTLY FIXED AND SOLID BUT AS THIS IN FORMATION WAS RECEIVED ONLY IN A LOOSE WAY FROM THE PUBLIC GAZETTES THE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHERS HERE WERE SUSPENDED IN RELATION TO THEIR GIVING CREDIT TO THIS READ MAY 21 1761157 THIS VERY EXTRAORDINARY PHAENOMENON UNTIL THE TRUTH OF IT COULD BE SUFFICIENTLY AUTHENTICATED THIS HAS VERY LATELY BEEN DONE BY PROFESSOR BRAUN WHO FIRST MADE THE EXPERIMENTS AND WHO PRESENTED AN ACCOUNT OF THEM TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY AT PETERSBURG A PRINTED COPY OF WHICH HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED BY HIM TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY PROFESSOR BRAUN OBSERVES THAT EVERY AGE HAS ITS INVENTIONS AND THAT THE DISCOVERY OF SOME THINGS SEEM TO BE RESERVED FOR PARTICULAR PERSONS TO THIS THE HI STORY OF SCIENCES IN ALL AGES MORE PARTICULARLY OF THE LATE AND THE PRESENT BEARS WITNESS SUFFICIENTLY BY THE INVENTION OF THE AIRPUMP BAROMETERS THERMOMETERS OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS ELECTRICITY MORE PARTICULARLY THE NATURAL ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS PHOSPHORUS THE DISCOVERY OF THE ABERRATION OF LIGHT AND OF MANY OTHER THINGS IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY HE DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER THE CONGELATION OF MERCURY WHICH IT WAS HIS GOOD FORTUNE TO DISCOVER MAY NOT BE RANGED AMONG THESE FOR WHO DID NOT CONSIDER QUICKSILVER AS A BODY WHICH WOULD PRESERVE ITS FLUIDITY IN EVERY DEGREE OF COLD NEITHER WAS THE FACT OTHERWISE IF THIS IS UNDERSTOOD OF NATURAL COLD SUCH AS IT HAS BEEN FOUND IN ANY PART OF THE GLOBE HITHERTO DISCOVERED BUT IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN THAT THE NATURAL COLD SHOULD EVER BE SO IN TENSE AS ARTIFICIAL COLD HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE THE WHOLE GLOBE WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT FACE AS MEN ANIMALS AND PLANTS WOULD CERTAINLY BE DESTROYED HE DID HINT SOME TIME SINCE IN A DISSERTATION UPON THE DEGREES OF HEAT WHICH CERTAIN LIQUORS AND CERTAIN FLUIDS WOULD BEAR BEFORE THEY BOILED AND THE DEGREES OF COLD THEY RESPECTIVELY BORE BEFORE THEY WERE CON VERTED INTO ICE THAT THERE WAS A SUSPICION THAT THE MERCURY158 MERCURY IN SOME OF THE BAROMETERS AND THERMOME TERS MADE USE OF FOR EXPERIMENTS IN SIBERIA HAD BEEN FROZEN BUT SINCE THAT IN GREATER DEGREES OF COLD THE MERCURY CONTINUED FLUID IN OTHER BAROMETERS AND THERMOMETERS THE IMMOBILITY AND HARDNESS OBSERVED IN SOME OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS ATTRIBUTED MORE PROBABLY TO THE LEAD OR THE BISMUTH WITH WHICH THE MERCURY HAD BEEN ADULTERATED AND WAS NOT CON SIDERED AS A REAL FREEZING OF THE MERCUCY BUT THIS HAS BEEN SINCE PUT OUT OF ALL DOUBT SINCE IT IS CER TAIN THAT PURE MERCURY WOULD NOT FREEZE UNDER SUCH SMALL DEGREES OF COLD GREAT AS THEY WERE FOR NATURAL COLD THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH THE PROFESSOR MADE IN ORDER TO CONGEAL MERCURY DEMONSTRATE THIS MOST EVIDENTLY BESIDES WHICH THEY EXHIBIT NEW PHAENO MENA THERE HAPPENED AT PETERSBURG ON THE 14TH OF DECEMBER 1759 A VERY GREAT FROST EQUAL IF NOT MORE INTENSE THAN ANY WHICH HAD BEEN OBSERVED THERE FOR BETWEEN NINE AND TEN OCLOCK IN THE MORNING DELISLES THERMOMETER STOOD AT 205 AT SEVEN OCLOCK AT 201 WHICH LAST WAS THE GREATEST DEGREE OF COLD THAT HAD BEEN OBSERVED AT PETERSBURG EITHER BY HIMSELF OR OTHERS AT ONE OCLOCK AT NOON THE THERMOMETER STOOD AT 197 MR BRAUN HAD BEEN EMPLOYED SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THIS IN OBSERVING THE SEVERAL DEGREES OF COLD WHICH DIFFERENT FLUIDS WOULD BEAR BEFORE THEY WERE CONVERTED INTO ICE PARTLY TO CONFIRM THOSE THINGS WHICH HE HAD ALREADY LAID BE FORE THE ACADEMY AND PARTLY TO MAKE EXPERIMENTS UPON LIQUORS WHICH HAD NOT YET BEEN EXAMINED AS ON THE DAYS BETWEEN THE 7TH AND 14TH THE COLD WAS INTENSE159 INTENSE ENOUGH TO BE BETWEEN THE DEGREES OF 181 AND 191 WHEN THE NATURAL COLD WAS SO INTENSE AS TO BE AT 205 PROFESSOR BRAUN CONJECTURED THAT IT WAS OF ALL OTHERS THE MOST PROPER OCCASION TO TRY THE EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL COLD NOT DOUBTING BUT THAT ARTIFICIAL COLD WOULD BE INCREASED IN PROPORTION AS THE NATURAL WAS MORE INTENSE AQUAFORTIS WHICH WAS FOUND BY THE THERMOMETER TO BE 204 DEGREES COLD WAS THE GREATEST PART OF IT FROZEN THE ICE HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF CRYSTALS OF NITRE WHICH HOWEVER IMMEDIATELY DIS SOLVED IN A SMALL DEGREE OF HEAT THIS AQUAFORTIS WHICH THOUGH FROZEN AT THE SIDES WAS LIQUID IN THE MIDDLE WAS POURED UPON POUNDED ICE IN THAT PRO PORTION WHICH WAS DIRECTED BY FAHRENHEIT THE FIRST PERSON WHO MADE ARTIFICIAL COLD WITH SPIRIT OF NITRE BUT BEFORE THE PROFESSOR MADE THIS EXPERIMENT HE BY EXAMINATION FOUND THAT BOTH THE ICE AND AQUA FORTIS WERE OF THE TEMPERATURE WITH THE AIR WHICH WAS THEN 204 UPON THE FIRST POURING THE MERCURY FELL 20 DEGREES THIS SPIRIT WAS POURED OFF AND FRESH PUT ON SEVERAL TIMES BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE BY THESE MEANS TO INTRODUCE NO MORE THAN 30 DEGREES OF COLD SO THAT THE MERCURY IN THE THERMOMETER FELL NO LOWER THAN 234 SINCE THEREFORE FAHRENHEIT COULD NOT PRODUCE COLD GREATER THAN THAT OF 40 BELOW THE CYPHER OF HIS THERMOMETER WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH 210 OF THAT EMPLOYED BY PROFESSOR BRAUN NOR REAUMUR NOR MUSCHENBROEK WHO OFTEN REPEATED THE SAME EXPERIMENT OUR AUTHOR WAS UPON THE POINT OF GIVING UP THIS PURSUIT AS CONSIDERING THIS AS THE GREATEST DEGREE TO WHICH ARTIFICIAL COLD COULD BE CARRIED THINKING IT SUFFICIENT HONOUR TO HIMSELF TO160 TO HAVE ADDED 20 DEGREES TO THE COLD FORMERLY KNOWN BUT REFLECTING THAT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE FRUIT HE EXPECTED FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS HE DETERMINED TO PURSUE THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER TO VARY THE MANNER OF THEM BY GOOD FORTUNE HIS ICE WAS ALL GONE AND HE WAS COMPELLED TO USE SNOW IN ITS STEAD AFTER HAVING FIRST TRIED AND FOUND THE SNOW OF THE SAME DEGREE OF COLD WITH THE AIR AT THIS TIME 203 THE SNOW THE THERMOMETER AND THE AQUAFORTIS BEING OF THE SAME TEMPERATURE HE IM MERSED THE THERMOMETER IN SNOW CONTAINED IN A GLASS AND AT FIRST ONLY POURED A FEW DROPS OF THE AQUAFORTIS UPON THAT PART OF THE SNOW IN WHICH THE THERMOMETER WAS IMMERSED UPON WHICH HE OB SERVED THE MERCURY TO SUBSIDE TO 260 ELATED BY THIS REMARKABLE SUCCESS HE IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVED HOPES THAT THESE EXPERIMENTS MIGHT BE CARRIED FURTHER NOR WAS HE DECEIVED IN HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR REPEATING THE EXPERIMENT IN THE SAME SIMPLE MANNER HE POURED ON ONLY SOME MORE AQUAFORTIS AND IMMEDIATELY THE MERCURY FELL TO 380 UPON WHICH HE IMMERSED THE THERMOMETER IN ANOTHER GLASS FILLED WITH SNOW BEFORE IT HAD LOST ANY OF THIS ACQUIRED COLD AND AT LENGTH BY THIS THIRD EXPERIMENT THE MERCURY SUBSIDED TO 470 DEGREES WHEN HE OBSERVED THIS ENORMOUS DE GREE OF COLD HE COULD SCARCE GIVE CREDIT TO HIS EYES AND BELIEVED HIS THERMOMETER BROKE BUT TO HIS INFINITE SATISFACTION UPON TAKING OUT HIS THERMOMETER HE FOUND IT WHOLE THOUGH THE MERCURY WAS IM MOVEABLE AND CONTINUED SO IN THE OPEN AIR TWELVE MINUTES HE CARRIED HIS THERMOMETER INTO A CHAM BER WHERE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS 125 DE GREES161 GREES AND AFTER SOME MINUTES THE MERCURY BEING RESTORED TO ITS FLUIDITY BEGAN TO RISE BUT TO BE CER TAIN WHETHER THIS THERMOMETER HAD RECEIVED ANY IN JURY AND WHETHER IT WOULD YET CORRESPOND WITH HIS THERMOMETER WHICH HE KEEPS AS A STANDARD HE SU SPENDED THEM TOGETHER AND IN TWENTY MINUTES THE THERMOMETERS CORRESPONDED ONE WITH THE OTHER THE THERMOMETERS WHICH OUR AUTHOR USUALLY EM PLOYS HAVE A SPHERICAL BULB AND THEIR SCALE IS DIVIDED INTO 1200 PARTS OF WHICH 600 ARE ABOVE THE CYPHER WHICH DENOTES THE HEAT OF BOILING WATER AND 600 BE LOW THAT HEAT A THERMOMETER OF THIS CONSTRUCTION WAS USED IN INVESTIGATING THE HEAT OF BOILING MERCURY AND OILS HE HAD ANOTHER THERMOMETER OF WHICH THE SCALE WENT NO LOWER THAN 360 DEGREES BELOW THE CYPHER DENOTING THE HEAT OF BOILING WATER HE RE PEATED THE FORMER EXPERIMENT WITH THIS AND THE MER CURY VERY SOON DESCENDED SO THAT THE WHOLE WAS CON TAINED IN THE BULB WHICH HOWEVER IT DID NOT QUITE FILL THE MERCURY IN THIS BULB WAS IMMOVEABLE EVEN THOUGH HE SHOOK THE THERMOMETER UNTIL ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT BEGAN TO ASCEND IN THE OPEN AIR AND IT CONTINUED TO ASCEND TILL IT BECAME HIGHER THAN THE CIRCUMAMBIENT AIR SEEMED TO INDICATE HE WAS STRUCK WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY PHAENOMENON AND VERY ATTENTIVELY LOOKED AT THE MERCURY IN THIS THER MOMETER AND FOUND CERTAIN AIR BUBBLES INTERSPERSED WITH THE MERCURY WHICH WERE NOT IN THAT OF THE OTHER THERMOMETER FROM THESE AND OTHER EXPERI MENTS IT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY TO RECITE THEM ALL HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THE MERCURY IN THESE THERMO METERS HAD BEEN FIXED AND CONGEALED BY THE COLD V O L LII Y HITHERTO162 HITHERTO OUR PROFESSOR HAD ONLY SEEN THE MERCURY FIXED WITHIN THE BULB OF HIS THERMOMETERS THESE HE WAS UNWILLING TO BREAK HE WAS HOWEVER DE SIROUS OF EXAMINING THE MERCURY IN ITS FIXED STATE AND THEREFORE DETERMINED TO BREAK HIS THERMOMETERS IN THE NEXT EXPERIMENTS IT WAS SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE HE GOT OTHER THERMOMETERS WHICH EXACTLY CORRESPONDED WITH THOSE HE HAD ALREADY EMPLOYED WHEN THESE WERE PROCURED THE NATURAL COLD HAD SOMEWHAT RELENTED IN THE FORMER EXPERIMENT THE THERMOMETER STOOD AT 204 IT WAS NOW AT 199 IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENT HE VARIED THE MANNER A LITTLE HE FIRST PUT THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER INTO A GLASS OF SNOW GENTLY PRESSED DOWN BEFORE HE POURED ON THE AQUAFORTIS HE THEN IN ANOTHER GLASS POURED THE AQUAFORTIS UPON THE SNOW BEFORE HE IMMERSED HIS THERMOMETER THEREIN HE THEN IN LIKE MANNER PUT THE SNOW TO THE AQUAFORTIS BEFORE HE PUT HIS THER MOMETER THEREIN WHICH EVER OF THESE WAYS HE PROCEEDED HE FOUND THE EVENT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE WHOLE DEPENDED UPON THE AQUAFORTIS DISSOLVING THE SNOW WHEN HE HAD PROCEEDED SO FAR AS TO FIND THE MERCURY IMMOVEABLE HE BROKE THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN CRACKED IN THE EXPERIMENT BUT THE PARTS WERE NOT SEPARATED HE FOUND THE MERCURY SOLID BUT NOT WHOLLY SO AS THE MIDDLE PART OF THE SPHERE WAS NOT YET FIXED THE EXTERNAL CONVEX SURFACE OF THE MERCURY WAS PERFECTLY SMOOTH BUT THE INTERNAL CONCAVE ONE AFTER THE SMALL PORTION OF MERCURY WHICH REMAINED FLUID WAS POURED OUT APPEARED ROUGH AND UNEVEN AS THOUGH COM POSED OF SMALL GLOBULES HE GAVE THE MERCURY SEVE RAL STROKES WITH THE PESTLE OF A MORTAR WHICH STOOD NEAR163 NEAR HIM IT HAD SOLIDITY ENOUGH TO BEAR EXTENSION WITH THESE STROKES ITS HARDNESS WAS LIKE THAT OF LEAD THOUGH SOMEWHAT SOFTER AND UPON STRIKING IT SOUNDED LIKE LEAD WHEN THE MERCURY WAS EXTENDED BY THESE STROKES HE CUT IT EASILY WITH A PENKNIFE THE MERCURY THEN BECOMING SOFTER BY DEGREES IN ABOUT TWELVE MINUTES IT RECOVERED ITS FORMER FLUIDITY THE AIR BEING THEN 197 THE COLOUR OF THE CONGEALED MERCURY DID SCARCE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE FLUID IT LOOKED LIKE THE MOST POLISHED SILVER AS WELL IN ITS CONVEX PART AS WHERE IT WAS CUT THE NEXT DAY THE COLD HAD INCREASED TO 212 DE GREES WHICH WAS 7 DEGREES BEYOND WHAT IT HAD EVER BEFORE BEEN OBSERVED AT PETERSBURG THE SEASON SO MUCH FAVOURING HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO CONTINUE HIS PURSUIT NOT ONLY IN FURTHER CONFIRMATION OF WHAT HE HAD ALREADY OBSERVED BUT TO INVESTIGATE NEW PHAENO MENA IN TWO THERMOMETERS HE OBSERVED THE SAME FACTS IN RELATION TO THE CONGEALING OF MERCURY AS HE DID THE PRECEDING DAY IN THE BULBS WHICH HE BROKE THE WHOLE OF THE MERCURY WAS NOT FIXED AS A VERY SMALL PORTION MUCH LESS THAN THAT OF THE PRECEDING DAY CONTINUED FLUID HE TREATED THIS MERCURY AS HE DID THE FORMER HE BEAT IT WITH A PESTLE HE CUT IT AND EVERY THING WAS THUS FAR THE SAME BUT HE SAW A VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE IN RELATION TO THE DESCEND ING OF THE MERCURY IN THE THERMOMETER THE LIKE OF WHICH DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM NEITHER IN THE FORMER NOR ANY OF THE SUBSEQUENT EXPERIMENTS FROM THE FORMER ONES IT APPEARED THAT THE MERCURY IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT HAD ONLY DESCENDED TO 470 WHEN IT BE CAME IMMOVEABLE THOUGH THE GLASS BULB WAS NOT CRACKED IN THE EXPERIMENT OF THE 25TH IT DESCENDED Y 2 TO164 TO 530 AND IN TWO THERMOMETERS ON THE 26TH TO 650 BUT AS WELL IN THE THERMOMETER WHICH HE USED ON THE 25TH AS IN TWO OF THE 26TH THE BULBS WERE CRACKED IN THE EXPERIMENT THEY COHERED HOW EVER NOR WAS THE LEAST PART OF THE BULB SEPARATED BUT THE CONGEALED MERCURY SEEMED TO ADHERE TO ALL PARTS OF THE BULB IN THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS HE INVARIABLY FOUND THAT THE MERCURY SUNK LOWER IF THE WHOLE OF IT WAS CONGEALED THAN IF ANY PART OF IT REMAINED FLUID IT THEN GENERALLY DESCENDED TO 680 AND 700 BUT THE BULBS WERE NEVER WITHOUT CRACKS MOREOVER IT DESCENDED TO 800 AND BEYOND EVEN TO 1500 BUT IN THIS LAST EXPERIMENT THE BULB WAS QUITE BROKE SO THAT THE GLOBE OF MERCURY THOROUGHLY FROZEN FELL OUT AND BY ITS FALL OF ABOUT 3 FEET THE GLOBE OF MERCURY BECAME A LITTLE COMPRESSED BUT IN THE FORMER ONLY SOME PARTS OF THE BULB FELL OFF MR BRAUN ALWAYS FOUND THAT CAETERIS PARIBUS THE MORE INTENSE THE NATURAL COLD WAS THE MORE EASY AND MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY THESE EXPERIMENTS DID SUC CEED IN CONTINUING THESE EXPERIMENTS HE OBSERVED THAT DOUBLE AQUAFORTIS WAS MORE EFFECTUAL THAN SIMPLE SPIRIT OF NITRE BUT THAT IF BOTH THE AQUAFORTIS AND GLAUBERS SPIRIT OF NITRE WHICH HE SOMETIMES ALSO USED WERE WELL PREPARED THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT VERY CONSIDERABLE WHEN HIS AQUAFORTIS WAS FROZEN WHICH OFTEN HAPPENED HE FOUND THE SAME EFFECTS FROM THE FROZEN PARTS WHEN THAWED AS FROM THAT PART OF IT WHICH REMAINED FLUID IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTLE SIMPLE SPIRIT OF NITRE THOUGH IT SELDOM BROUGHT THE MERCURY LOWER THAN 300 DEGREES BY THE FOLLOWING METHOD HE EVEN FROZE MERCURY WITH IT HE165 HE FILLED SIX GLASSES WITH SNOW AS USUAL AND PUT THE THERMOMETER IN ONE OF THEM POURING THEREUPON THE SPIRIT OF NITRE WHEN THE MERCURY WOULD FALL NO LOWER IN THIS HE IN THE SAME MANNER PUT IT IN A SECOND THEN IN A THIRD AND SO IN A FOURTH IN WHICH FOURTH IMMERSION THE MERCURY WAS CONGEALED ANOTHER VERY CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE PRESENTED IT SELF IN PURSUING THESE INQUIRIES WITH REGARD TO THE MODE OF DESCENT OF THE MERCURY HE CONSTANTLY AND INVARIABLY OBSERVED THAT THE MERCURY DESCENDED AT FIRST GENTLY BUT AFTERWARDS VERY RAPIDLY BUT THE POINT AT WHICH THIS IMPETUS BEGINS IS NOT EASY TO ASCERTAIN AS IN DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS IT BEGINS VERY DIFFERENTLY AND SOMETIMES AT ABOUT 300 AT OTHER TIMES ABOUT 350 AND EVEN FURTHER IN THE EXPERI MENT BEFOREMENTIONED IN WHICH THE MERCURY FELL TO 800 IT PROCEEDED VERY REGULARLY TO 600 ABOUT WHICH POINT IT BEGAN TO DESCEND WITH VERY GREAT SWIFTNESS AND THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER WAS BROKE THE MERCURY HOWEVER WAS PERFECTLY CON GEALED HE FREQUENTLY OBSERVED ANOTHER REMARKABLE PHAE NOMENON WHICH WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THE SPIRIT OF NITRE THE SNOW AND THE MERCURY IN THE THERMOME TER WERE PREVIOUSLY REDUCED TO THE SAME TEMPERATURE UPON POURING THE SPIRIT OF NITRE UPON THE SNOW THE MERCURY IN THE THERMOMETER ROSE BUT AS THIS DID NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN HE CAREFULLY ATTENDED TO EVERY CIR CUMSTANCE FROM WHICH IT APPEARED THAT THIS EFFECT AROSE FROM HIS POURING THE AQUAFORTIS IMMEDIATELY UPON THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER NOT PREVIOUSLY WELL IMMERSED IN THE SNOW HE LIKEWISE OBSERVED ANOTHER EFFECT TWICE ONLY AND THIS WAS THAT AFTER THE166 THE THERMOMETER HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE SNOW AND AQUAFORTIS THE MERCURY CONTINUED TO SUBSIDE IN THE OPEN AIR DOWN AS LOW AS THE CONGEALATION OF MER CURY IN THE COURSE OF THESE INQUIRIES OUR PROFESSOR FOUND NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER HE MADE USE OF LONG OR SHORT THERMOMETERS WHETHER THE TUBES WERE MADE OF THE BOHEMIAN OR THE GLASS OF PETERSBURG UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES THE SAME EFFECTS WERE ALWAYS PRODUCED MAKING AN ALLOWANCE FOR THE DIFFERENT CONTRACTION OF THE DIFFERENT GLASSES UNDER SO SEVERE A DEGREE OF COLD BUT IF THESE TUBES WERE FILLED WITH DIFFERENT MERCURY THERE WAS THEN A SENSIBLE DIF FERENCE INASMUCH AS MERCURY REVIVED FROM SUBLI MATE DID NOT SUBSIDE SO FAST IN THE THERMOMETER AS THAT DID WHICH WAS LESS PURE HE HAS EVEN FOUND THAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONGEAL THE LESS PURE MER CURY AT A TIME WHEN HE COULD NOT BRING THE REVIVED MERCURY LOWER THAN 300 DEGREES BUT THIS HE WOULD TILL FARTHER TRIALS HAVE BEEN MADE NOT HAVE CONSIDERED AS A GENERAL AXIOM FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS OUR AUTHOR CONCEIVES IT DEMONSTRATED THAT HEAT ALONE IS THE CAUSE OF THE FLUI DITY OF MERCURY AS IT IS THAT OF WATER AND OTHER FLUIDS IF THEREFORE ANY PART OF THE WORLD DOES EXIST IN WHICH SO GREAT A DEGREE OF COLD PREVAILS AS TO MAKE MERCURY SOLID THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT THAT MERCURY OUGHT TO APPEAR THERE AS A BODY EQUALLY FIRM AND CONSISTENT AS THE REST OF THE METALS DO HERE THAT MERCURY UPON CONGEALING BECOMES ITS OWN ICE HOWEVER DIFFERENT THE MERCURIAL ICE MAY BE FROM THAT OF WATER OR OTHER LIQUIDS THE IDEA OF FREEZING DOES OR CAN COMPREHEND NOTHING MORE THAN 6167 THAN A TRANSITION OF BODIES FROM A STATE OF FLUIDITY TO THAT OF FIRMNESS BY THE SOLE INTERPOSITION OF COLD THE ICE OF OILY AND SALINE BODIES DIFFERS GREATLY FROM THAT OF WATER WHICH IS FRIABLE AND EASILY BROKE WHEREAS THAT OF MERCURY IS DUCTILE AND M BRAUN PROCEEDS TO CONSIDER ALL BODIES WHICH LIQUIFY BY HEAT AS SO MANY SPECIES OF ICE SO THAT EVERY METAL WAX TALLOW AND GLASS COMES WITHIN HIS VIEW IN THIS RE SPECT MERCURY THEN IS IN ITS NATURAL STATE A SOLID ME TAL BUT IS FUSIBLE IN A VERY SMALL DEGREE OF HEAT EVERY METAL BEGINS TO FLOW IN A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HEAT BUT THIS DEGREE IS DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT METALS PURE TIN BEGINS TO RUN AT 420 LEAD AT 530 AND BISMUTH AT 470 IN FAHRENHEITS THERMOMETER OR ACCORDING TO OUR AUTHOR LEAD LIQUIFIES AT 320 ABOVE THE CYPHER IN HIS SCALE WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH 596 IN FAHRENHEIT LEAD AT 170  416 OF FAHRENHEIT BISMUTH AT 235  494 ZINC REQUIRES A GREATER HEAT TO MELT IT THAN WILL MAKE MERCURY BOIL NOW IF IT COULD BE SETTLED AT WHAT POINT MERCURY WOULD BE GIN TO BE CONGEALED WE SHOULD KNOW THE POINT AT WHICH IT BEGAN TO FLOW AS IT HAS BEEN LONG KNOWN THAT WATER IS EITHER FLUID OR SOLID AS THE HEAT OF IT IS A VERY FEW DEGREES ABOVE OR UNDER 32 IN FAHRENHEITS THERMOMETER JUST SO METALS BECOME SOLID AT ALMOST THE SAME DEGREE OF HEAT IN WHICH THEY BECOME FLUID BUT IN MERCURY THE CONGEALING POINT IS AT TOO GREAT A LATITUDE TO BE EXACTLY DETERMINED BUT OUR AUTHOR ESTIMATES IT TO BE ABOUT 469 DEGREES IN HIS THERMO METER AT A LESS DEGREE THAN WHICH HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBSERVE THE SLIGHTEST CONGEALATION HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE CONDENSATION OR CONTRACTION AND CONSEQUENTLY168 CONSEQUENTLY THE DIMINUTION OF THE VOLUME OF MER CURY MUST BE VERY GREAT INDEED THIS IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE GREAT DESCENT OF THE MERCURY IN THE THERMO METER WHILE IT IS FREEZING BUT HOW GREAT THIS DI MINUTION OF THE VOLUME OF THE MERCURY IS CANNOT EXACTLY BE DETERMINED AND HENCE ARISES NO SMALL DIF FICULTY IN DETERMINING ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY AS THIS LAST MUST INCREASE AS THE BULK OF THE MERCURY LESSENS HENCE AS MERCURY EVEN IN ITS FLUID STATE COMES OF ALL BODIES PLATINA EXCEPTED THE NEAREST TO GOLD IN ITS SOLID STATE IT MUST STILL APPROACH MUCH NEARER OUR AUTHOR HAD THREE THERMOMETERS FILLED WITH THE MOST HIGHLY RECTIFIED SPIRIT OF WINE THESE NOT ONLY CORRESPONDED EXACTLY WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT IN LESS SEVERE TRIALS CORRESPONDED REASONABLY WELL WITH THOSE FILLED WITH MERCURY BUT BY THE MIXTURE OF SNOW AND SPIRIT OF NITRE WHICH FROZE THE MERCURY HE NEVER WAS ABLE TO BRING THE SPIRIT THERMOMETERS LOWER THAN 300 FROM HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE HEAT WHICH WILL FREEZE MERCURY WILL NOT FREEZE SPIRIT OF WINE AND THAT THEREFORE SPIRIT THERMOMETERS ARE THE MOST FIT TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF COLDNESS IN FRIGORIFIC MIXTURES UNTIL WE ARE IN A SITUATION TO CONSTRUCT SOLID METALLIC THERMOMETERS WITH SUFFICIENT ACCURACY OUR AUTHOR MADE MANY EXPERIMENTS TO TRY THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT FLUIDS IN HIS FRIGORIFIC MIXTURES HE INVARIABLY FOUND THAT GLAUBERS SPIRIT OF NITRE AND DOUBLE AQUAFORTIS WERE THE MOST POWERFUL WITH OIL OF VITRIOL THE MOST PONDEROUS OF ALL ACIDS HE WAS NEVER ABLE TO CONGEAL MERCURY HE LIKEWISE TRIED A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER FLUIDS BOTH ACID AND SPIRITUOUS WHICH THOUGH WHEN MIXED WITH SNOW PRODUCED COLD IT WAS IN VERY DIFFERENT DEGREES HE TRIED169 TRIED A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO THIS PURPOSE BUT IT WAS IN WEATHER FAR LESS COLD THAN THE PRECEDING EX PERIMENTS WERE TRIED IN VIZ BETWEEN 159 AND 153 BY HIS THERMOMETER BY THESE IT APPEARS THAT SPIRIT OF SALT POUNDED UPON SNOW INCREASED THE NATURAL COLD 30 DEGREES SPIRIT OF SAL AMMONIAC 10 OIL OF VITRIOL 35 GLAUBERS SPIRIT OF NITRE 58 AQUAFORTIS 40 SIMPLE SPIRIT OF NITRE 30 SPIRIT OF VINEGAR AND LEMON JUICE MADE NO REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE DULCI FIED SPIRIT OF VITRIOL 20 HOFFMANS LIQUOR ANODYNUS 32 SPIRIT OF HARTSHORN 10 SPIRIT OF SULPHUR 10 SPIRIT OF WINE RECTIFIED 20 CAMPHORATED SPIRIT 15 FRENCH BRANDY 12 AND EVEN SEVERAL KINDS OF WINE INCREASED THE NATURAL COLD TO 6 7 OR 8 DEGREES THAT INFLAMMABLE SPIRITS SHOULD PRODUCE COLD SEEMS VERY EXTRAORDINARY AS RECTIFIED SPIRIT SEEMS TO BE LI QUID FIRE ITSELF AND WHAT STILL APPEARS MORE PARDOXI CAL IS THAT INFLAMMABLE SPIRITS POURED INTO WATER CAUSE HEAT UPON SNOW COLD AND WHAT IS WATER BUT MELTED SNOW THOUGH NOT IMMEDIATELY RELATING TO THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OF THIS TREATISE OUR AUTHOR MEASURED BY HIS THERMOMETER WHEN IT STOOD IN HIS STUDY AT 128 DE GREES THE HEAT OCCASIONED BY POURING DIFFERENT FLUIDS INTO WATER HE FOUND THAT OIL OF VITRIOL PRODUCED 35 DEGREES SPIRIT OF SEA SALT 10 HOFFMANS ANODYNE LIQUOR RECTIFIED 5 SPIRIT OF WINE 10 ON THE CON TRARY SPIRIT OF SAL AMMONIAC MIXED WITH SNOW SPIRIT OF SULPHUR AND SPIRIT OF HARTSHORN MIXED LIKEWISE WITH SNOW MADE NO PERCEPTIBLE DIFFERENCE HIGHLY RECTI FIED CHYMICAL OILS MIXED WITH WATER PRODUCED NO HEAT NOR WITH SNOW NO COLD AS WAS TRIED IN THE OILS OF TURPENTINE AMBER MINT AND MOTHER OF THYME V O L LII Z AND170 AND HERE IT IS TO BE REMARKED NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONTRARY HAS BEEN GIVEN OUT BY SOME THAT THESE CHY MICAL OILS MIXED WITH THE MOST HIGHLY RECTIFIED SPIRIT OF WINE DO PRODUCE NO COLD EITHER UPON THEIR MIX TURE OR HALF AN HOUR AFTER IT RESULTS FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY LIQUIDS WHICH CAN PRODUCE ARTIFICIAL COLD THE NITROUS ACID IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND MERCURY MAY BE CONGEALED BY IT WITHOUT ANY DIF FICULT PROCESS AT ANY TIME WHEN THE HEAT OF THE AT MOSPHERE IS NOT GREATER THAN 175 BY THE THERMOME TER BEFOREMENTIONED AND THESE EXPERIMENTS HAVE NOT ONLY SUCCEEDED WITH OUR AUTHOR BUT WITH MANY OTHERS AMONG WHOM IT MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO MEN TION MESSIEURS LOMONOSOW ZEIHER AEPINUS AND MODEL AS THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE MADE THEMSELVES WELL KNOWN IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL WORLD THE NITROUS ACID WAS POURED UPON THE SNOW IN NO DETERMINATE QUANTITY SOMETIMES A FEW DROPS WERE SUFFICIENT SOMETIMES IT REQUIRED A LARGER QUANTITY SNOW SEEMS TO BE MORE FIT FOR THOSE EXPERIMENTS THAN POUNDED ICE AS THE FORMER FROM ITS LOOSE TEXTURE IS OF MORE APT AND EASY SOLUTION HENCE IT APPEARS THAT MERCURY IS NO LONGER TO BE RANKED WITH THE SEMIMETALS BUT AS A PERFECT ONE FUSIBLE THOUGH WITH A MUCH LESS DEGREE OF HEAT THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS IT AGREES LIKEWISE WITH OTHER METALS AS THEIR PARTS LIKE IT WHEN IN FUSION ATTRACT ONE ANOTHER AND RUN INTO GLOBULES AND FROM A STATE OF FLUIDITY PASS INTO A SOLID STATE NOT ALL AT ONCE BUT SUCCESSIVELY AND VICE VERSA BUT IT IS WORTH INQUIRING WHETHER THIS METAL WHICH AGREES WITH ALL OTHERS BOTH IN A SOLID AND FLUID STATE HAS NOT THE PARTICULAR 5 PROPERTY171 PROPERTY OF BOILING AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HEAT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS TO BE OBSERVED IN OTHER METALS THE DEGREE OF HEAT IN WHICH MERCURY BEGINS TO BOIL IS NOT AT 600 OF FAHRENHEITS SCALE AS IS GENERALLY IMA GINED BUT AT LEAST AT 709 OF THE SAME SCALE WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH 414 OF OUR AUTHORS WHOSE CYPHER IS AT THE HEAT OF BOILING WATER BOTH THE BOILING AND FREEZING OF MERCURY HAVE THIS IN COMMON THAT WHEN IT BEGINS TO BOIL IT RISES WITH RAPIDITY AND DESCENDS RAPIDLY WHEN IT BEGINS TO FREEZE IF THEREFORE THE MEAN TERM OF THE CON GEALATION OF MERCURY IS FIXED AT 650 BELOW THE CYPHER AND THE TERM OF ITS BOILING AT 414 ABOVE THE CYPHER ITS GREATEST CONTRACTION TO ITS GREATEST DILATATION WILL BE 1064 DEGREES OF OUR AUTHORS THERMOMETER AND 1237 OF FAHRENHEITS AS 212 IS THE POINT OF BOIL ING WATER IN THIS LAST AND 32 THE FREEZING ONE WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH 150 UNDER THE TERM OF BOILING WA TER IN OUR AUTHORS HENCE EVERY ONE WILL SEE THE GREAT ALTERATION OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY IN FROZEN AND BOILING MERCURY AS BETWEEN ONE AND THE OTHER THE TENTH PART OF THE VOLUME IS LESSENED IT MAY BE ASKED WHY THE MIXTURE OF SNOW AND NITUROUS ACID DOES NOT RUN INTO A SOLID MASS AND FORM ITSELF INTO ICE BUT REMAIN OF A SOFT CONSISTENCE AL THOUGH ACTUALLY MUCH COLDER THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED TO FREEZE AQUAFORTIS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT AQUAFORTIS FREEZES AT 204 OF OUR AUTHORS THERMO METER WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH 34 BELOW THE CYPHER OF FAHRENHEITS THE FRIGORIFIC MASS IN A DEGREE OF COLD FAR BELOW THIS REMAINED SOFT LIKE A PULTICE THE CAUSE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY PHAENOMENON SEEMS TO BE NO OTHER THAN A CONTINUATION OF THE SOLUTION OF Z 2 THE172 THE SNOW AND ITS MIXING WITH THE NITROUS ACID FOR AS THE PRODUCTION OF COLD DEPENDS SOLELY UPON THE SOLUTION AND MIXTURE IT CANNOT HAPPEN THAT THIS MASS WHICH CONSTITUTES A FLUID OF A HARD KIND SHOULD RUN INTO A SOLID CONSISTENCE SO LONG AS THE SOLUTION AND MIXTURE CONTINUE AND NOW GENTLEMEN IT REQUIRES NO SMALL SHARE OF YOUR INDULGENCE TO PARDON MY HAVING EXTENDED THIS ACCOUNT SO FAR BUT I HAVE TO PLEAD IN MY EX CUSE THAT THE SUBJECT OF THIS WORK IS INTIRELY NEW AND REPLETE WITH A VAST VARIETY OF CURIOUS FACTS ALL WHICH EXACTLY FALL IN WITH OUR EXCELLENT INSTITUTION FOR WHO BEFORE MR BRAUNS DISCOVERY WOULD HAVE VENTURED TO AFFIRM MERCURY TO BE A MALLEABLE METAL WHO THAT SO INTENSE A DEGREE OF COLD COULD BE PRODUCED BY ANY MEANS WHO THAT THE EFFECTS OF POURING NITROUS ACID UPON SNOW SHOULD SO FAR EXCEED THOSE WHICH RESULT FROM MIXING IT WITH ICE WHEN SNOW AND ICE ARE PRODUCED FROM THE SAME SUBSTANCE AND SEEM TO DIFFER ONLY IN THEIR CONFIGURATION AS MR BRAUNS WORK IS IN VERY FEW HANDS I HAD REASON TO HOPE THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE DISPLEASED TO BE IN FORMED IN A DEGREE SOMEWHAT CIRCUMSTANTIAL OF THESE VERY EXTRAORDINARY FACTS I AM WITH THE MOST PROFOUND RESPECT GENTLEMEN YOUR MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT W WATSON APRIL 18 1761 XXXII OB

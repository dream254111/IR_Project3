complete description of the calorimeter chamber which they are using at Middletown in their interesting experiments upon energy transformations in the human body THE COMPENSATED ALTERNATOR THE alternating current dynamo when used to supply current to lamps only or to one type of electric motors only may be made to give constant electromotive force by providing a compound field winding When however an alternator supplies current in varying amounts to lamps and to motors simultaneously the electromotive force cannot be kept constant by compounding One of the most interesting of recent improvements in the alternator is that of E W Rice Jr of the General Electric Com pany The alternator and exciter are mounted on the same shaft and the alternating currents pass through the exciter armature on their way to the mains causing such variations of the electromotive force of the exciter as to compen sate for all kinds of variations of load on the alternator This new alternator is described in the American Electrician for November W S F NOTES ON INORGANIC CHEMISTRY A PAPER has been lately issued by the Wis consin Academy on the influence of the presence of pure metals upon plants by E B Copeland and L Kahlenberg It is a complete refu tation of the theory of Nageli of the oligo dynamic effects of metals upon plants which is that where a plant is growing in water in contact with a metal as copper a trace of cop per goes into the solution as a metal and pro duces a toxic action very different from that produced by a salt of copper in solution In the experimental portion of the work of Cope 861 land and Kahlenberg plants corn oats lupines and soja beans were grown in water in paraffin coated glass beakers in which were exposed as nearly as possible the same surfaces of different metals Twentyfive or more elements were tested and while at the end of the experiment many of them were scarcely tarnished most showed themselves to have had some influence upon the plant used Comparing with the se quence given by Neumann of elements arranged according to their surface tensionsmagnesium aluminum manganese zinc cadmium thallium iron cobalt nickel lead hydrogen bismuth arsenic antimony tin copper mercury silver palladium platinum goldall of these ele ments down to mercury except aluminum tin and magnesium are injurious and except ing further manganese and bismuth fatal dur ing the time of the experiment Mercury and silver were sometimes injurious palladium platinum and gold never Regarding aluminum and magnesium their salts are comparatively harmless Comparing their results with the known toxicity of the salts of the correspond ing metals the authors conclude that the poison ous action is due to the solution of the metal in the form of a salt and not to an action of any other nature The paper gives an interesting summary of our knowledge on the toxicity of metals toward plants and has also a bibliog raphy of the subject IN a paper on the heat of combination of cop per with zinc presented to the Chemical So ciety London Dr T J Baker makes use of chlorin water and of HNO3 3H20 as solvents of the brass Up to 30  copper no heat of forma tion could be detected it then begins and rises to an illdefined maximum at 62o copper and then gradually sinks to zero at 100 cop per This alloy of 62 copper while pos sessed of somewhat remarkable properties does not correspond to any simple atomic com pound Cu5Zn3  618 copper the existence of the supposed compound CuZn2 326 copper is rendered doubtful from the fact that the alloy of this proportion shows almost no heat of formation FURTHER researches on radiant matter in pitchblende have been made by A DeBierne DECEMBER 8 1899N S VOL X No 258 and are published in the Comptes Rendus Polo nium already found by Curie seems akin to bismuth and radium to barium DeBierne has worked upon that portion of the solution of pitchblende which is not precipitated by hydro gen sulfid in acid solution but is by ammonia or ammonium sulfid In this portion were present with iron and aluminum small quantities of many other metals as zinc manganese chromium vanadium etc and rare earths A new radiant substance was found closely akin analytically to titanium whose power is 5000 times as great as that of uranium but is not spontaneously luminous as in the case with radium IN the Zeitung fur Biologie H Harms has gone over again the question of the quantity of fluorin in bones and his conclusion is that the amount varies from 0005 o to 0022 o and that the quantity is so small and variable that it must be considered not as belonging to the con stitution of the bones and teeth but as merely accessory IT has long been believed that the step from the inorganic carbon dioxid and water to organic plant substance that is to the carbohydrates was by way of formaldehyde but the actual existence of the intermediate product could not be proven By macerating fresh leaves with pure water and immediately distilling it has been possible for Gino Pollacci to detect formaldehyde in the dis tillate The test used for formaldehyde is the violet color given with codein and concentrated sulfuric acid A NOTABLE contribution to the stereochem istry of nitrogen by W J Pope and S J Peachey appears in the last Proceedings of the Chemical Society London When abenzyl phenylallylethyl ammonium iodid is heated with silver dextrocamphorsulfonate it is re solved into optical isomers respectively dextro and levorotary Here the optical activity ap pears to be clearly due to the asymmetry of the quinquevalent nitrogen atom linked to five dif ferent groups or atoms When the paper was read Dr Armstrong characterized it as being the most valuable contribution to stereochemistry since the introduction of geometrical consider ations by Le Bel and vant Hoff J L H SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS MEMORIAL exercises in honor of the late Ed ward Orton were held at the Ohio State Univer sity on

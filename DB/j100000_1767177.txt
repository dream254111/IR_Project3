of Chinese Literature in the University of Leyden has undertaken to resolve a series of problems relating to the identification of various mysterious peoples mentioned by the early Chinese historians They have more than special interest because they bear on the question of the peopling of America from Asiatic sources As early as 500 AD there is a description of a tattooed people Wenchin living 7000 li northeast of Japan Dr Schlegel identi fies them with the inhabitants of Ouroup one of the Kurile is lands but adds that in historic times every tribe from the island of Yezo to Greenland had the habit of tattooing except the Ghiliaks and Itulmens of Kamschatka He would also place the  Land of Women Niukouo said to be 1000 1i east of Fu sang somewhere in the southern portion of the Kurile Archi pelago In an article on The Land of Little Men he main tains the important thesis that the Tungusic stock at one time occupied the whole of the Japanese archipelago Professor Schlegels essays may be had of E J Brill publisher Leyden An interesting study of Chinese gilds recently appeared in the Yale Review from the pen of the accomplished sinologue Mr Frederick Wells Williams Within a few pages he exemplifies the great extent and completeness of the gild system among the Chinese and illustrates the singular similarity of their laws to those of mediaeval and modern trades unions in Europe and America Progress in American Archaeology The science of American archaeology and ethnology owes a large and increasing debt to Professor F W Putnam who rep resents those branches in the faculty of Harvard University and who is also Curator of the Peabody Museum and Chief of the Department of Ethnology and Archaeology of the Worlds Col umbian Exposition All these posts he fills admirably as any one will see who will read his Report of the Peabody Museum for 1892 just issued One fact will be sufficient that within the last two years he has engaged trained and sent into the field  and the field means the whole American continent from Greenland to Tierra del Fuegoabout one hundred assistants and students actively interested in collecting archmeological and ethnological material He says with pardonable pride and en tire justice Never before has such an extensive field of an thropological research been covered in two years time A brief reference to the results obtained is included in the report Natu rally the exploration of the wonderful ruins of Copan Honduras is most prominently alluded to In connection therewith Pro fessor Putnam cannot refrain from a mild indulgence in his favorite manie hinting at the discovery of  several facts point ing to Asiatic arts and customs as the origin of those of the early peoples of Central America Shade of Brasseur de Bourbourg With like enthusiasm though on a less scale the Department of Archaeology of the University of Pennsylvania sent several explorers to the field in 1892 and has added largely to its collec tions by their efforts while the National Museum the Bureau of Ethnology and the Smithsonian Institution will show in time by their reports that the year was also singularly fruitful for them The Study of Hair A note which I inserted in Science Nov 4 on this subject led Mr Mott FRGS to send me a reprint of an article which he read some time ago before the Leicester Literary and Philosophi cal Society The position he maintains has at any rate the merit of novelty Arguing not quite correctly that the highest races of man are the hairiest he maintains that this is the result of natural selection that therefore these hairiest types will in crease while the more naked forms will be eliminated until in a few centuries men and women will be clothed with natural garments of fine soft fur and the occupation will be gone of both Parisian milliners and the i old clo man  More practical are the observations in the last number of the Zeitschrifb fuir Ethnologie on the prevalence of moustaches in I59 women by Dr S Weissenberg He was struck with their fre quency in Constantinople and on several occasions counted the number of visibly hirsute upper lips on the women between eighteen and fifty years of age whom he met in the streets He found it to be about ten per cent of the total number which he justly claims is a high rate On reading his article I made similar observations in the streets and stores of Philadelphia and found the moustached women between the ages mentioned to be less than three per cent but I attribute little value to this state ment for I happen to know that the depilatory Rusma has an active sale in the drug stores and that more than one physi cian makes a profitable little specialty of destroying unsightly hairs by electropuncture These considerations interfere with ethnographic observations I have noticed more moustached women in Madrid than in any other city Dr Weissenberg be lieves the Armenian women present this peculiarity most fre quently The Madridlenas will surely push them close In ne gresses and mulattoes it seems quite absent Recent Craniological Studies Professor Sergi of the University of Rome has lately pub lished two applications of his taxinomic method in crani ology the one to a collection of 400 skulls from Melanesia the second to a smaller assortment from Sardinia In the formerhe begins by speaking of the chaos in the descriptions of the Crania Ethnica of De Quatrefages and Hamy averring that nothing less than the thread of Ariadne could guide one in such a labyrinth He then describes his own method and very pru dently gives a vocabulary of the astonishing Greek descriptive terms which he has coined a few of which were mentioned in Science Feb 24 1893 The result of his study he claims to be the annihilation of the Papuas as a race and he demands that the name be stricken from the ethnographic lexicon as the al leged Papuas are a compound of many varieties not confined to Melanesia as the term is generally understood but extending over Australia many islands of Polynesia and Micronesia and even to the Andaman Islands A few only of these varieties are localized as for instance the hypsistenoclitobrachymetopus stenocrotaphicus neocaledonensis Applying his method to skulls from Sicily and Sardinia from a moderate number Professor Sergi defines thirteen varieties in the former isle and eight in the latter and intimates that this does not at allexhaust the types He believes that by noting such types 1 we can follow the migrations and diffusion of the varieties which have peopled Italy and resolve many problems in anthropology and ethnology hitherto obscure He regards the long narrow cranium as that most ancient in the two islands and it is a form still common among the inhabitants However much we may admire Professor Sergis enthusiasm and the nicety of his observations it must appear evident to the unbiased observer that his results are open to serious question ings I find that in any collection of skulls whether from Melanesia Sicily or Sardinia he discovers by his  method a new type in at least every twenty he adduces no evidence to show that these types correspond to any ethnic distinction whether physical or psychical he makes no effort to show nega tively that these various types are not from children of the same parents and same lineage nor that the same types may not be found in perfection among races the most distant and of no eth nic relationship I am sure that some of the types he describes are as truly American as they are Sicilian or Melanesian The conclusions arrived at by such reasoning are I submit like those of other authorities which he himself stigmatizes as not merely incorrect but misleading An interesting point in the anatomy of the skull is discussed in a late number July 1892 of the Proceedings of the Berlin Anthropological Society It is in reference to the frequency of that enlargement of the palate known as the  torus palatinus It is present in threefourths of the Slavic Poles in about one half of the Sibiric tribes in about onefourth of the American Indians and Europeans of Aryan race while it is quite absent among Jews and Gypsies What its ethnic significance is if it has any remains for future investigators to determine MARCH 24 1893

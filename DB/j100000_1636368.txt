right in both cases As you will note from the North American Flora which we have published the Saliax and Populus forms are very similar Since your material came in I have gone over it very carefully and I feel sure that they do have some fundamental differences The Larix rust associated with Salix has been collected be fore once in Alberta and once in Wisconsin The one associated with Populus has been proven by cultures but not before collected H H WHETZEL D REDDICK DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY CORNELL UNIVERSITY SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES THE academy met at St

1910 President Woodward in the chair Two papers were read Present High Temperature Work Abroad Dr A L DAY of the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington The paper dealt with the speakers observations while recently visiting the three principal physical laboratories of Europe in France Germany and England with special reference to the present status of high temperature work now in progress in those countries The reasons why none of these countries are at present active in high tempera ture work was explained and it was also stated that such work would soon be resumed by them At the Reichsanstalt good activity was found in vapor tension and absolute temperature deter minations and radiation measures at these temp eratures In this connection Nernsts spectro bolometric measures were mentioned The speaker told of his efforts to calibrate a thermoelement by means of the boiling point of sulphur and of finding a difference of about one and one half degrees from the gas thermometer This led him to inquire into the previous deter minations of the sulphur boiling point and of the conditions surrounding them The difficulties of making such determinations were explained at some length Weather Proverbs and their Justification Dr W J HUMPHREYS of the U S Weather Bureau The paper dealt especially with the causes of the phenomena described by some of the useful proverbs and the relation of these phenomena to others they precede Weather conditions have always exerted great influence upon human affairs and due to which 806 SCIENCEDECMBER 2 1910 many rules have been formulated in all ages and by all peoples for foretelling coming changes of weather some of which rules have more or less to support them and are worthy of careful consid eration and study since they have in them accu rate descriptions of the phenQmena and state the events following them Although mqst countTies aow have a national weather service which gathers accurate informa tion of meteorologieal conditions all over a con tinent yet in general it is not practicable to fore cast the weather conditions for 4efinite hours nor for particular farms and villages also it is not possible in many places to get official forecasts or maps upon which ta base ones own conclusions and under such cixcumstances certain weather signs are of special value Several classes of proverbs were quoted by the speaker and were discussed at some length Among these were those in reference to the sea sons the sun sky color coronas and haloes the moon the stars the wind the clouds sound etc especial reference being made to those which are concerned with sky coloring including the physical justification for the opposite meanings of a red sky in the evening to that of a red morning sky R L

communication of the evening was by Ch Wardell Stiles on  Work of the Committee on Nomenclature at the Graz Zoological Con gress Dr Stiles told of the organization meth ods of procedure and future plans of the com mittee It is hoped that With cooperation of the leading zoologists of the world decided progress toward stability of nomenclature will soon be made The paper was discussed by L 0

Friday October 28 1910 at eight oclockPM President Winm A Taylor presided Thirtyeight members were in attendance Mr H C Gore reported new facts developed during the study of the processing of Japanese persimmons In experimenting with a modifica tion of the Japanese method in which alcohol was used as the active agent instead of saki it was found that the fruits often become soft and that the alcohol seemed to stimulate the softening as well as increase the rate of the disappearance of soluble tannin PrinzenGeerligs has observed that on keeping bananas in an atmosphere deprived of oxygen the fruit remained firm and the use of some inert gas in which to keep the persimmons during the processing suggested itself Experi ments were therefore tried in which the air was displaced by carbon dioxide A marked retarda tion in softening occurred while the fruits proc essed successfully both in vapors of alcohol and also in presence of carbon dgoside alone Alcohol therefore is unnecessary in processing persimmons Whether the fruits become nonastringent as a result of the exclusion of oxygen or because of the specific activity of carbon dioxide is as yet unde 807N S VOL XXXII No 831 termined Five varieties of Japanese persimmons were found to process satisfactorily in carbon dioxide in from three to five days The following papers were read The Behavior of Pure Line Cultures of Glomer ella Dr C L SHEAR Studies of pure line pedigreed cultures of a species of Glomerella obtained from an acervulus on a leaf of the avocado Persea gratissima were made starting with a single conidium isolated in a poured plate and transferred to a tube of corn meal agar Twentythree successive generations were grown from this culture and carefully com pared with each other Single ascospore cultures obtained in the same manner from the same initial culture were also made and studied through seven generations All were grown on the same medium and kept under apparently the same conditions of environment Variations in all the characters of the organism occurred The variations of the conidial fructi fications and perithecia were most striking The greatest variation was shown in the series origin ated from a single conidium Some of the char acters were transmitted for several generations and then either suddenly or gradually disappeared Others appearing suddenly in one generation were not transmitted to the next but reappeared in later generations The kinds of variLation occurring and their be havior were so erratic that they are not easily classified or explained Whether these variations should be regarded as new expressions of latent hereditary characters as fluctuating variations or as mutations is not clear Much more data must be collected before any satisfactory conclusion can be drawn Though the physical chemical and biological characters of environment of the organ ism were supposed to be the same it is possible that some of the variations observed may have been in some way induced or influenced by some slight unrecognized variation of some environ mental factor or factors It seems more probable at present however that some of the sudden and striking variations noted would more properly be referred to some other category not usually re garded as primarily due to the influence of en vironment Line Breeding of Vegetables Professor L 0 COR BETT This paper outlined the commercial need for line breeding by citing the chaotic condition of such groups as the garden beet in which the socalled varieties are distinguished merely by the predom inance of a given form If for instance 60 per cent of the plants in any sample are blood turnip although the other 40 per cent may be composed of a number of different types the variety is according to the trade blood turnip What is true of the beet is also true of cabbage The work the department of agriculture is doing in the line breeding of lettuce cauliflower cabbage beets tomatoes and beans was described and illustrated by photographs The work is to make true rather than new types and strains The trade already has too many socalled varieties But there is great need of strains true to type especially adapted to particular uses and industries Some Aspects of the Speoies Question Dr E L GREENE The full paper is to be published elsewhere W W STOOEBEoREB Corresponding Seoretary THE ANTIHROPOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON THE 448th regular meeting of the society the first of the present session was opened by the president Dr J Walter Fewkes in the hall of the Public Library October 18 1910 8 PM The speaker of the evening was M Capitan Professeur au College de France who delivered a discourse entitled Apercu sur lAreheologie Pr6historique de la France illustrated with lan tern slides The lecturer illustrated and described Swiss dwellings dolmens and numerous imple ments of the chase used by the prehistoric races of France Frequent comparisons were made with archeological objects from America It was shown that religious and superstitious motives largely entered into the making of the earliest rock in scriptions Among the views shown were a reindeer found at Brunequil horses skulls elephants female figures on rocks and stelae from Mas dAzil a re production of the grotto at Lourdes as also carved and incised figures of the horse and hip potamus The grotto of Eyzies Dordogne where Mr Otto Hauser has carried on extensive excava tions was also thrown on the screen Other slides illustrated household furnitures and uten sils It was also pointed out by the lecturer that the prehistoric inhabitants made use of the eleva tions and rugged surfaces in the rocks in the delineation of their drawings J M CASANOWICZ Secretary b08 SCIENCE

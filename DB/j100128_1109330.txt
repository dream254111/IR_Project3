Federal Legislation,i246238,THE HISTORY OF THE ADOPTION OF SEC TION I OF ARTICLE IV OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND A CONSID ERATION OF THE EFFECT ON JUDG MENTS OF THAT SECTION AND OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION The object of this paper is to sketch briefly an interest ing bit of legal history It is well worth while to discover that the favored position over foreign judgments which our own judgments possess wherever the United States has jurisdiction was deliberately intended for them and was established by enactments which have proved sufficiently broad to meet the changing conditions of our national expansion but it is just as much worth while to get an in sight into the difficulties of construction which have been overcome Both ends are sought in this article a HISTORICAL RETROSPECT Prior to the adoption of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union  by the thirteen American Colonies the courts of one colony in the absence of statutory provision prescribing another rule regarded the judgments of courts of sister colonies as foreign judgments in the strict sense i e as only prima facie evidence in many instances of the de mand recovered on and hence subject to be reexamined on their merits and impeached for fraud want of jurisdiction or prejudice Indeed under the common law of England today the judgments of the courts of the various colonies of Great Britain have only the standing of strictly foreign judgments when sued on in the courts of other colonies2 Local statutes may vary this common law rule at the pres Hilton v Guyot I895 I59 U S at

329330 and cases citedARYICLE IV SECTIONI OF THE CONSTITUTION 471 ent time in some colonial jurisdictions but prior to the adoption of the Articles of Confederation only a few of the American colonies had passed statutes by which judg ments rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in a neighboring colony could not be impeached1 The prov ince of Massachusetts Bay was one It was governed in the matter by its provincial act of 14 George III c 2 which provided that judgments rendered in the courts of neigh boring colonies might be sued on in Massachusetts in actions of debt and that on a plea of nul tiel record the records of those judgments attested by the clerk of the court rendering the same should be good and sufficient evidence of the records By this statute judgments rendered in the courts of the neighboring colonies could not be here in Massachusetts impeached provided the courts rendering those judgments had competent jurisdic tion2 The inconvenience caused by debtors after judg ments against them in one colony removing with their effects into the then province of Massachusetts Bay before satisfying those judgments2 and then impeaching the justice of the judgments when sued on in Massachusetts gave rise to this provincial Act of 14 George III c 2 and the same inconvenience in the different colonies caused the insertion of a provision about judgments in the Articles of Confederation When in 1778 the American colonies formed the con federacy of The United States of America it was seen by the wise men of that day that the powers necessary to be given to the Confederacy and the rights to be given to the citizens of each State in all the States would produce such intimate relations between the States and persons that the former would no longer be foreign to each other in the sense that they had been as dependent provinces and that for the prosecution of rights in courts it was proper to put an end to the uncertainty upon the subject of the effect of judgments obtained in the different States Accordingly in the Articles of Confederation there was this clause Full faith and credit shall be given in each of these States 1 Hilton v Guyot 1895 159 U S at p 181 2 Bissell v Briggs 1813 9 Mass at p 465COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW to the records acts and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates of every other State  Under the Articles of Confederation it seems that a question then arose as to the mode of authentication 2 which was left by the Articles unprovided for so when the con federacy was replaced by the Union the constitution of the United States contained the still stronger provision  Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state And the Con gress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof3 1 McElmoyle v Cohen 1839 13 Pet at p 325 Articles of Confedera tion Art IV last paragraph The full faith and credit clause of the Articles of Confederation was adopted by the Continental Congress on Nov I2 1777 without division and It was then moved to add and an action of debt may be com menced in a court of law of any state for the recovery of a debt due on judgment of any court in any other state provided the judgment creditor shall give bond with sufficient sureties before the said court in which the action shall be brought to answer in damages to the adverse party in case the original judgment should be afterwards revised and set aside and pro vided the party against whom such judgment may have been obtained had notice in fact of the service of the original writ upon which such judgment shall be founded  but the motion to add was voted down 2 Journals of Congress I777I778 at p 325 The full faith and credit clause of the Articles of Confederation neces sarily permitted actions of debt on judgments and it was held that notice in fact was necessary to give a personal judgment the protection of the clause See Phelps v Holker Pa 1788 I Dall 26I so the only part of the motion to add which did not go into effect was the requirement of a bond 2Haines J

the final discussion took place as follows Monday Sept 3 1787 In convention Mr Gouverneur Morris moved to amend the Report concerning the respect to be paid to acts records etc of one state in other states see the ISt of September by striking out judgments obtained in one state shall have in another and to insert the word thereof after the word effect Col Mason favored the motion particularly if the  effect was to be restrained to judgments and judicial proceedings Mr Wilson remarked that if the legislature were not allowed to declare the effect the provision would amount to nothing more than what now takes place among all independent nations  Dr Johnson thought the amendment as worded would authorize the general legislature to declare the effect of legislative acts of one state in another state  Mr Randolph considered it as strengthening the general objection against the plan that its definition of the powers of government was so loose as to give it opportunities of usurping all the state powers He wasCOLUMBIA LAW RIEVIEW  This section was intended to give the same conclusive effect to the judgments of all the states so as to promote certainty and uniformity in the rule among them This section has three distinct objects I To declare that full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the records etc in every other state 2 The manner of authenticating such records etc and 3 their effect when so authenticated The first is declared and established by the constitution itself and was to receive no aid nor was it susceptible of any qualification by the legislature of the United States The second and third objects of the section were expressly referred to the legislature of the union to be carried into effect in such manner as to that body might seem right2 It will be noticed that the chief difference between the provision in the Articles of Confederation and that in the United States Constitution is that under the constitution Congress can fix the method of proving judicial acts and can declare their effect when so proved whereas under the Articles of Confederation Congress could not provide the method of authentication and could not legislate upon what should be the effect of a judgment obtained in one state in the other statess for not going further than the report which enables the legislature to provide for the effect ofjudgments On the

McElmoyle v Cohen 1839 13 Pet at p 326 The Federalist supported the full faith and credit clause of the consti tution in the following language The power of prescribing by general laws the manner in which the public acts records and judicial proceedings of each state shall be proved 474ARTICLE IV SECTIONI OF THE CONSTITUTION 475 The very first Congress of the United States exercised some of its power under this section of the federal consti tution by passing the following act approved May 26 I7901 Be it Enacted etc  That the acts of the legislatures of the several states shall be authenticated by having the seal of their respective states affixed thereto that the records and judicial proceedings of the courts of any state shall be proved or admitted in any court within the United States by the attestation of the clerk and seal of the court annexed if there be a seal together with a certificate of the judge chief justice or presiding magistrate as the case may be that the said attestation is in due form And the said records and judicial proceedings authenticated as aforesaid shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the state from whence the said records are or shall be taken This act was later supplemented by one approved March 27 I804 which prescribed the authentication of records etc not appertaining to a court and then continued Sec 2 And Be It Further Enacted that all the provisions of this act and the act to which this is a supplementt shall apply as well to the public acts records office books judicial proceedings courts and offices of the respective territories of the United States and countries subject to the and the effect they shall have in other states is an evident and valuable im provement on the clause relating to this subject in the Articles of Confeder ation The meaning of the latter is extremely indeterminate and can be of little importance under any interpretation which it will bear The power here established may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice and be particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous states where the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly translated in any stage of the process within a foreign jurisdiction Federalist No 42 41 written by Madison See Fords Edition p 279 Madison is thus shown both to have been inappreciative of the clause m the Articles of Confederation and also to have favored the clause in the constitution for the very reasons which led Massachusetts to adopt her pro vincial act on the subject 1 I U S Stat at Large 122 The Act was probably approved May 6 1790 instead of May 26th The bill was introduced into the House of

records office books judicial proceedings courts and offices of the several states1 b LEGAL CONSTRUCTION The question of the effect of the constitutional provision and of the acts of May 26 1790 and March 27 I804 caused much conflict of opinion Many state courts held that the constitution and the statutes intended merely to provide a mode of authentication and proof of the records and judicial proceedings of other States and consequently did not mean to confer upon the judgments of courts of sister States any greater rights than were accorded foreign judgments at the common law They held in other words that the federal constitution and statutes left sisterstate judgments like other foreign judgments only prima facie evidence of the matter adjudged2 But in I813 the United States Supreme Court decided3 that by virtue of the constitution and laws of the United States the judgment of a State court which has jurisdic tion is conclusive evidence in every court in the United States of the matter adjudged and that decision is still law The court devoted its attention in that case particularly to the argument that the act of May 26th 1790 did not exercise the constitutional power of Congress to declare the 2 U S Stat at Large pp 2989 The act of 1790 and the part of Sec 2 of the act of 1804 applicable to judgments appear now as  905 of the Revised Statutes of the United States which section reads as follows  go5 The acts of the legislature of any state or territory or of any country subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall be authenti cated by having the seals of such state territory or country affixed thereto The records and judicial proceedings of the courts of any state or territory or of any such country shall be proved or admitted in any other court within the United States by the attestation of the Clerk and the seal of the Court annexed if there be a seal together with a certificate of the judge chief justice or presiding magistrate that the said attestation is in due form And the said records and judicial proceedings so authenti cated shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the States from which they are taken The Annals of Congress do not give any of the debates on either of the bills embodied in this Section They seem to have been passed as a matter of course 2 See cases collected in margin of p i85 of I59 U S with this view Chief Justice Marshall seems at first to have coincided Peck v William son 1813 Fed cases No 10896 see Hilton v Guyot I895 I59 U S at p I82 but in I818 he wrote the opinion in Hampton v McConnell I818 3 Wheat 234 affirming Mills v Duryee I813 7 Cranch 481 3 Mills v Duryee 1813 7 Cranch 48I 476ARTICLE IV SECTIONI OF THE CONSTITUTIONI 477 effect of authenticated judgments and in reference to that said speaking through Story J It is argued that this act provides only for the admission of such rec ords as evidence but does not declare the effect of such evidence when ad mitted This argument cannot be supported The act declares that the record duly authenticated shall have such faith and credit as it has in the state court from whence it is taken If in such court it has the faith and credit of evidence of the highest nature namely record evidence it must have the same faith and credit in every other court Congress have there fore declared the effect of the record by declaring what faith and credit shall be given to it  It remains only then to inquire in every case what is the effect of a judgment in the State where it is rendered Under Mills v Duryee and subsequent cases following it a State judgment is placed on a different footing in other States from that accorded to a strictly foreign judgment It is not merely prima facie evidence but conclusive evi dence of every matter properly adjudicated and it has other advantages to be gone into later Then again there were some judges who held that the first part of the full faith and credit clause of the federal constitution was not selfexecuting and that therefore we must look to the acts of Congress alone to find out the effect or degree of force which judicial proceedings are to have outside of the States where they take place2 Other judges however followed Judge Story in holding that the first sentence of the full faith and credit clause was selfexecuting and rendered the judgments of courts of sis terstates conclusive when properly proved regardless of the acts of Congress 3 While the proposition has never been expressly decided by the Supreme Court of the United States the dicta are all to the effect that the first sentence of the full faith and credit clause is selfexecuting For instance in Huntington v Attrill4 the court approved Judge Storys doctrine as follows Mills v Duryee I813 7 Cranch 48r at p 484 2 Warren v Flagg 1824 2 Pick 448 Robinson v Prescott I828 4 N H 450 Snyder v Wise 1848 Io Pa St

6845COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW  This clause of the constitution like the less perfect provision on the sub ject in the Articles of Confederation     had three distinct ob jects first to declare and by its force establish that full faith and credit should be given to the judgments of every other State second to authorize Congress to prescribe the manner of authenticating them and third to authorize Congress to prescribe their effect when so authenticated Story on the Constitution  I307 1308 And in McElmoyle v Cohen1 the Court by Wayne J said  The authenticity of a judgment and its effect depend upon the law made in pursuance of the Constitution the faith and credit due to it as the judicial proceeding of a State is given by the Constitution independently of all legislation If the full faith and credit clause is selfexecuting there is no doubt that the full faith and credit properly given the judgment in the State where it is rendered for nothing short of that could be full faith and credit2 In any event the fact remains that but for the full faith and credit clause of the United States constitution the judgments of the courts of sisterstateswhich for brevity we shall denomi 1839 13 Pet at p 3245 2 The question whether the first sentence of the full faith and credit clause in the constitution is selfexecuting is raised in practice by asking whether the judgments of Justices of the Peace rendered in one State are entitled to full faith and credit in another The doubt on the matter arises in this way Under the Act of Congress of May 26 1790 judgments are authenti cated as we have seen  by the attestation of the clerk and the seal of the court annexed if there be a seal together with a certificate of the judge chief justice or presiding magistrate that the said attestation is in due form U S Rev Stats  905 Courts of Justices of the Peace however are not usually so constituted as to have seals or clerks and therefore most cases hold that they are not within the act

who have compared the copy with the original Blackwell v Glass 1884 43 Ark 209the question arises what is its effect  The cases cited above to the proposition that such a judgment is not within the act of May 26 I790 all agree that the effect is exactly the same as that of a strictly foreign judgment viz that the judgment is ordinarily only primafacie evidence See also Evans v Cleary 1889 125 Pa 204 Other cases hold that once the jurisdiction of the justice is shown the effect of such a judgment is just the same as that of a judgment of a court of record authenticated under the Act of Congress These last cases all go on the ground that the first sentence of the full faith and credit clause in the U S Constitution is selfexecuting and that once a judgment is proved no matter how to be a valid sisterstate judgment it must by virtue of the constitutional provision itself be given full faith and credit i e such faith and credit as it has in the State where it was rendered Silver

judicialf5roceedings of every other state and judgments of Justices of the Peace are of course judicial pro ceedings as much as judgments of courts of record are If as the cases last cited hold and as seems to be the better view this provision is self executing the judgments of Justices of the Peace of another State if once proved to be such and to be within the jurisdiction of the justice are as fully protected as are duly authenticated judgments of courts of record A few cases say that whether the full faith and credit clause is self executing or not usually they hold not a properly proved judgment of a Justice of the Peace of a sisterstate should be given the same conclusive effect as is given to judgments of courts of general jurisdiction authenti cated under the Act of Congress Glass v Blackwell i886 48 Ark 50 Gayv Lloyd Iowa 1847 I Greene at p 85 Danforth v Thompson I872 34 Iowa 243 Banister v Campbell 1903 138 Cal 455 semble Such a position is of course defensible on the ground that judgments of sisterstates should be given superior rights over strictly foreign judg ments because of the greater comity which exists between sisterstates The intimate union of these states as members of the same great political family the deep and vital interests which bind them so closely together should lead us in the absence of proof to the contrary to pre sume a greater degree of comity and friendship and kindness towards one another than we should be authorized to presume between foreign nations Bank of Augusta v Earle i839 13 Pet 519 at p 59o Considering however that where a

62 Case v Huey I88I 26 Kas 553 See Swift J in Bissell v Edwards Conn I812 5 Day 363 at p 366 The question is of comparatively little practical importance today because the protection of the Constitution and of the acts of Congress may be obtained for Justices judgments in another way In almost every State if not in every State it is provided by statute that a transcript of any judgment of a Justice of the Peace duly certified by the Justice may be filed with a court of record in the county where the Justice holds court and upon the proper entries being made in the office of the clerk of the court of record execution may issue thereon from said court of record and the said judgment may become a lien in the same way as judgments of the court of record Where such statutory provisions exist and are complied with the Justices judgment so treated can be authenticated under the act of Congress as a judgment of the court of record and is fully protected by the full faith and credit clause of the constitution and the acts of Congress Rowley v Carron 1887 117 Pa 52 I Atl 435 Bright v Smitten 1891 10 Pa Co Ct Rep 647 Upham v Damon I866 94 Mass 12 Allen 98 But while such

v Arguelles I83I Fed Cas No 213 4Cranch C C 170 Pierce v Davidson 1894 58 Mo App o06 Ellis v White 1854 25 Ala 540 A way thus exists to give to judgments of Justices of the Peace the protection of the U S Constitution and laws by resort to a court of record though it is submitted for the reasons above given that they are entitled to such protection in the absence of any such procedure The question whether the constitutional requirement is selfexecuting will some day come before the United States Courts in a case where a demurrer is interposed to a complaint which alleges a sisterstate judg ment but does not proffer a copy authenticated under the acts of Congress There the judgment will be admitted but not being  so authenticated  as required by Sec 905 of the Rev Stats it cannot be given any greater faith and credit than would be accorded to a strictly foreign judgment unless the first sentence of the full faith and credit clause is selfexecut ing There seems to be no reason to doubt that under such circum stances the sisterstate judgment would be given the full benefit of the constitutional provision Though the report of the case does not show it that was just what was done in the case of Keyser v Lowell 1902 II7 Fed 400 Dorsey v Maury 1848 i8 Miss io Smedes  M 298 Smith v Lathrop I863 44 Pa St 326 Pritchett v Clark 3 Harr Del 5I7 Eastern Townships Bank v Beebe I880 53 Vt 177

question of whether the full faith and credit clause is selfexecuting as to deserve considera tion with it is the question of whether the acts of Con gress of May 23 I790 and of March 27 1804 derive their whole validity from that clause The former question as we have just seen in note 20 p 478 involved the standing of judgments of sisterstate Justices Courts and other courts not courts of record and also of those sisterstate judg ments of courts of record which have been proved in other ways than by the method authorized by the acts of Congress but the latter question moots the standing of United States Court judgments in the different States of territorial judg ments in the States sisterterritories and insular possessions and of the judgments of courts of our insular possessions in the States territories and sisterinsular possessions For a long time it was supposed that the acts of May 26th I790 and of March 27 1804 depended wholly on the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitu tion for their validity and that as state  in that clause means only territory admitted to statehood the different States were not bound to regard the judgments of courts of the District of Columbia or of the territories as within the acts or protected by the United States Constitution On this ground it was decided in an early case that the judgments of courts of the District of Columbia were not within the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution and were therefore on no better footing in a State than foreign judg ments1 But in the case of Embry v Palmer the United States Supreme Court decided that while judgments of the District of Columbia were not within the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution Congress had power to prescribe their effect in the different States under the general judicial power of the United States and had done so in the Acts of May 26 1790 and March 27 1804 which require that judgments must be given such faith and credit as they are entitled to in the courts of the State territory or other country subject to the jurisdiction of the United States from which they are taken2 1 Drapers Executors v Gorman I837 8

only de cided the law for the District of Columbia it governs the cases of the territories proper and of countries appurte nant to the United States2 It has been decided that the judgments of the courts of the Indian nations are entitled to the same faith and credit as sisterstate judgments3 The following language of the court in Embry v Palmer is particularly instructive  So far as this statutory provision relates to the effect to be given to the judicial proceedings of the states it is founded on Art IV Sec i of the constitution which however does not extend to the other cases covered by the statute The power to prescribe what effect shall be given to the judicial proceedings of the courts of the United States is conferred by other provisions of the constitution such as those which declare the extent of the judicial power of the United States which authorize all legislation neces sary and proper for executing the powers vested by the constitution in the government of the United States or in any department or officer hereof and which declare the supremacy of the authority of the National Government within the limits of the constitution As part of its general authority the power to give effect to the judgments of its courts is coextensive with its territorial jurisdiction That the Supreme Court of the District of Colum bia is a court of the United States results from the right of exclusive legis lation over the district which the constitution has given to Congress Accordingly the judgments of the courts of the United States have invariably been recognized as upon the same footing so far as concerns the obligation created by them with domestic judgments of the states wherever rendered and wherever sought to be enforced1  8I3 7 Cranch 481

States and Territories of the United States as well as the effect of strictly sisterstate judgments but they determine the effect of other than strictly sister state judgments by virtue of other constitutional provisions than Art IV Sec i A judgment of a federal court of record in Porto Rico or the Philippines must be given in any state as much effect as would be given to a judgment of a court of record of a neighboring state of the Union not because of the full faith and credit clause of the federal constitution but because of the general powers of Congress exercised in the Acts of May 26 1790 and March 27 I8041 It has repeatedly been laid down by the United States Supreme Court that under these acts the judgments and decrees of courts of the United States are entitled to the same sanctity and effect in the courts of each state as judg ments and decrees of the courts of other States would be  nothing more but nothing less 2 for  The laws of the United States are laws in the several states and just as much binding on the citizens and courts thereof as the state laws are 3 and the judgments of United States courts are just as binding as those of the state courts and in some cases more so3 It must be admitted however that under a 1A judgment of a Justice of the Peace in a Territory say in New Mexico would raise squarely the question of whether the acts of May 26 1790

judgments if not covered by the acts of May 26 1790 and March 27 I804 are no better off in other states and territories than strictly foreign judgments 2Metcalf v Watertown 1894 153 U S 67I at p 676

not require state courts to give full faith and credit to judgments of United States courts and that it is somewhat judicial legislation for the United States Supreme Court to exact full faith and credit for such judgments1 Under  905 of the Revised Statutes of the United States if it stood alone it might be questioned whether the judg ments of the State courts stood on any better footing in Porto Rico and the Philippines than strictly foreign judg ments do for that simply provides that such judgments when authenticated as in the act required  shall have the same faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the states from which they are taken and under Downes v Bidwell 2 and subsequent cases it is doubtful if Porto Rican and Philippine Courts are courts within the United States But under a familiar rule of statutory interpreta tion we are authorized to look at the original acts of May 26 g90o and March 27 1804 to see what was meant by the words  within the United States in  905 the phrase being ambiguous 3 When we do so we discover that the act of March 27 I804 extended the act of May 26 I790 to cover the courts and judicial proceedings of countries subject to the jurisdiction of the United States as fully as the courts and judicial proceedings of the States4 and that therefore the language of the revisers of the Federal Statutes must be broadened by construction so as to give State and Territorial judgments the same effect in countries appurtenant to the United States and subject to its juris

be given in a State of the Union For the same reason the word  States in the same phrase  shall have the same faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the States from which they are taken must be enlarged to mean  States Territories or countries appurtenant to the United States and subject to its jurisdiction so as to give to the judgments of the Ter ritories and of our insular possessions the same faith and credit in the courts of the different States other Territories and other insular possessions that they have at home Having thus seen that the full faith and credit clause of the Federal constitution and the Acts of Congress of May 26 I790 and March 27 1804 were adopted for the express purpose of putting State and Territorial judgments on a favored footing over strictly foreign judgments when pleaded and proved in courts within the United States or within countries subject to its jurisdiction and that the purpose was accomplished it remains for us to consider briefly the exceptions which have been made to the general proposition that sisterstate judgments including there under Territorial and other judgments favored by the acts of Congress are conclusive evidence while strictly foreign judgments are only prima facie evidence of the matter adjudged The first thing to notice is that unless tainted by fraud certain strictly foreign judgments rendered by courts hav ing jurisdiction are as conclusive as are sisterstate judg ments Such favored strictly foreign judgments were grouped by Mr Justice Gray of the United States Supreme Court as follows  IJudgments in rem adjudicating the title to a ship or other moveable property within the custody of the court 2Judgments that are not contrary to the policy of the law of the State which is asked to enforce them and that affect the status of persons among which judgments are decrees confirming and dissolving a marriage 3Judgments under which a person has been compelled to pay money so far at least as to prevent him from having 1 Sussenbach v Wagner 1889 41 Minn io8 2 Hilton v Guyot t895 159 U S at pages I67168COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW to pay again or as to allow him to recover on a promise of indemnity 4Judgments discharging the obligations contracted in the foreign country between citizens or residents thereof But even these strictly foreign judgments are favored wholly because of comity They do not stand on the con stitutional and statutory right which sisterstate judgments do What comity sustains unfriendliness can take away and the case of Hilton v Guyot itself decided that comity does not require us to do more by others than they do by us and that therefore judgments rendered in any foreign country by the laws of which our own judgments are reviewable on the merits are only prima facie evidence of the justice of the claims they represent The second point to observe is that it is undecided as yet in the United States whether foreign judgments may be impeached if procured by false and fraudulent representa tion and testimony in behalf of the judgment creditor where the same question of fraud was passed on by the for eign court in giving judgment but that while the princi ple of Hilton v Guyot makes impeachable for fraud in ob taining them the judgments of English and other foreign courts which hold our own judgments impeachable for such fraud sisterstate judgments are not impeachable for any fraud which was matter of defense in the original ac tion2 nor for any other fraud which would not be good ground for defending against them at law or impeaching them in equity in the States where they were rendered3 Here again comity determines very largely the status of strictly foreign judgments but has nothing whatever to do with that of sisterstate judgments The third established doctrine to consider is the one early decided that a sisterstate judgment like a strictly foreign judgment is of no effect unless the court rendering it has jurisdiction4 This doctrine has been carried so far that I895 159 U S 13 2 Christmas v Russell 1866 5 Wall 290 Maxwell v Stewart I874 22 Wall 77 Allison v Chapman i884 I9 Fed 488 Union Trust Co v Rochester I886 29 Fed 609 Barras v Bidwell 1876 3 Woods U S 5 U S v Throckmorton 1878 98 U S 61 3Warrington v Ball I898 90 Fed 464 Ball v Warrington 19oI 1o8 Fed 472 Chadron Bank v Anderson 1896 6 Wyo 518 DArcey v Ketchum 1850 i How i65 486ARTICLE IV SECTION I OF THE CONSTITUTION 487 in deciding that one State need not enforce the judgments of a sisterstate which are penal in the international sense the United States Supreme Court by saying that a State court has no jurisdiction of such sisterstate judgments practically asserted that a State could not enforce penal sister state judgments if it wanted to This last assertion would certainly seem to be wrong But it is undoubtedly law that the provision in the fifth amendment forbidding the United States and that in the fourteenth amendment forbidding the States to deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law makes it impossible for either Congress or the States to make valid as a per sonal judgment one recovered after service by publication only and no appearance or valid as a judgment in renm one recovered where there was no jurisdiction of the subject matter2 Unless jurisdiction of the person is obtained there cannot be a valid personal judgment and unless juris diction of the subject matter is obtained there cannot be a valid judgment in rem and that is as true of sisterstate judgments as it is of strictly foreign judgments The cases on that proposition are many3 So while there was early a dispute as to whether where a sisterstate judgment re cited jurisdictional facts the nonexistence of those facts could be shown4 it was settled by Thomson v Whit man6 since severaltimes affirmed that the full faith and credit clause did not prevent the contradiction and dis proval of necessary jurisdictional facts recited in a sister state judgment That being so any court which refuses to allow such contradiction in an action on the judgment is really violating the United States constitution by depriving 1 Wisconsin v Pelican Ins Co 1888 127 U S 265 2 Pennoyer v Neff 1877 95 U S at pp 733734 3 See an article by the present writer

affirmed in German Savings and Loan Society v Dormitzer I904 192 U S 125 for there the court had acquired jurisdiction of the parties by their appearance but as it had not acquired jurisdiction of the res the judgment was a nullity 4 See cases collected in the American and English Encyclopaedia of Law ist Ed Vol XII pages I48x to I48z 2nd Ed pages 993 to 994 5 I873 i8 Wall 457COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW the apparent judgment debtor of his property without due process of law 1 The fourth and last proposition to remember is that a State may prohibit any action on a foreign judgmentTexas did so before its annexation to the United States but that while it may provide reasonable statutes of limitation for sisterstate judgments3 it cannot absolutely prohibit any action on such sisterstate judgments4 unless such judgments are penal in the international sense6 or unless they are sued on by foreign corporations6 c CONCLUSION Summing up what our review has shown us we note FirstThat the fundamental difference between strictly foreign judgments and those American judgments which we have denominated sisterstate judgments lies in the fact that the standing of the former rests on comity while that of the latter is protected by constitutional and statutory pro visions SecondThat Article IV Sec I of the United States Constitution like its prototype in the Articles of Confedera tion was framed for the express purpose of giving sister state judgments a favored footing over strictly foreign judg ments and that the acts of Congress carried out the pur l See Pennoyer v Neff 1877 95 U S pages 733734

that a judgment owned by a foreign corporation is entitled to no faith nor credit because the corporation is not entitled to the privileges and immunities of a citizen and it would seem to follow that if the foreign corporation should assign the judgment to a citizen it would in the latters hands be given full faith and credit It has been so decided in New York Nazro v McCalmont Oil Co I885 36 Hunn 296 This is undoubtedly true where under the law of the state in which the judgment is rendered the title to the judgment passes by the assignment Martin v Wilson 19o3 t20 Fed 202 488ARTICLE IV SECTIONI OF THE CONSTITUTION 489 pose by providing a mode of authentication which when resorted to would entitle them to that favored footing ThirdThat Article IV Sec I of the United States constitution applies only to State judgments when proved in other States but that the acts of Congress go farther and give effect to State judgments in the territories and insular possessions as well as in other States and likewise in aid of the general judicial power of the United States give the same conclusive effect in the States to the judgments of our territorial and insular possession courts FourttThat by judicial legislation the judgments of United States courts are held to be as conclusive in the States as are sisterstate judgments FiftThat the acts of Congress provide a mode of authentication which would seem erroneously to be deemed by some courts to be applicable to judgments of courts of record alone and that since it has never been determined by the United States Supreme Court that Article IV Sec i of the Constitution is selfexecuting there is a conflict of State authority as to whether a judgment of a Justice of the Peace of one State rendered with jurisdiction is conclusive evidence when proved in the courts of another SixtzThat the favored standing of sisterstate judg ments does not exist as to certain strictly foreign judgments made conclusive by comity does not extend to sisterstate judgments rendered without jurisdiction over the person or the res may not exist as to judgments obtained by fraud except in cases where our own judgments when sued on in the country from which the foreign judgment comes are not protected from reexamination as to matters of fraud already passed upon by the courts rendering the judgments and does not apply to sisterstate

j100011,Biological Bulletin,1535814,The Maturation of the Mouse Egg,i268186,THE MATURATION OF THE MOUSE EGG WILLIAM B KIRKHAM Sobotta 95 after careful study of a very large number of preparations of the egg and ovary of the white mouse came to the conclusion that in nine tenths of these eggs the maturation processes involve the suppression of the first polar spindle and the formation of only a single polar body Gerlach o6 after a study of preparations made at least as early as 1890 has re vived Tafanis theory that in the majority of mouse eggs the second polar body is suppressed Gerlachs conclusion is that when a spermatozoon enters an egg sometime after it has formed the second polar spindle the second polar body fails to develop and the spindle degenerates within the egg These results are at variance with the majority of opinions reached before and since by investigators of the eggs of other animals vertebrate and invertebrate and a reinvestigation of the maturation processes in the egg of the white mouse has brought it into line with most other metazo6n eggs Material and Method The mice used have been killed dur ing the period of most active breeding namely April May June and September and serial sections made of the ovaries and Fallo pian tubes Ovulation during the spring months occurs very soon after parturition independent of copulation as observed by Rubaschkin 05 in the guineapig When observed to be pregnant the females were mated and killed some a few days or hours before parturition others during that process and still others at intervals from a few minutes to thirty hours after giving birth to a litter The tissues were killed with a variety of the more generally used cytological fluids and the following is a brief summary of the results obtained All the ovaries contained some eggs with the second polar spindle and accompanied by the first polar body and a majority of the series revealed ovarian eggs at the end of the spireme or with the first polar spindle The eggs observed in the Fallopian tube fall into two main groups those which had not been fertilized and 259WILLIAM B KIRKHAM therefore retained the second polar spindle  some being accom panied by the first polar body more without it  and those which had been fertilized The latter included stages from the entrance of the spermatozo6n through the cleavage stages FIG I Ovarian egg showing first polar spindle Zona pellucida represented by double line X 1200 First Polar Spindle Fig i  The preparations in which there are stages immediately preceding the formation of the first polar spindle have not been fully studied but there is evidence of a precocious division the number of chromatin masses being be tween twelve and twentyfour The first polar spindle when first formed lies with its axis per pendicular to the radius of the egg as found by Rubaschkin 05 in the egg of the guineapig and later one pole swings some what toward the center of the egg The chromosomes of the first polar spindle are short and thick Fig 2 and vary greatly in size The spindle fibers come to more or less of a focus and centrioles have often been seen at the poles of this spindle where they are made up of several distinct eccentrically placed granules 260THE MATURATION OF THE MOUSE EGG First Polar Body Figs 3 and 5The study of many preparations reveals the following facts None of the eggs in the Fallopian tube have failed to develop at least to the formation of the second polar spindle and all the ovarian eggs which by their size slightly denser protoplasm and large follicles appear to be nearly ripe have already extruded the first polar body The conclusion arrived at is that ap parently every egg which is capable of further development forms a first polar body within the ovary This agrees with the observations of Ru baschkin o5 upon the guineapig egg and those of Van der Stricht o  upon the egg of a bat Vesper ugo noctula FIG 2 Diagram of chromo somes in first polar spindle Note great variation in size Four more chromatin masses in adjacent sections This point established it is next necessary to explatn the dis appearance of the first polar body in the majority of eggs seen in the Fallopian tube The zona pellucida may persist in the mouse egg undiminished through the early cleavage stages but in the majority of instances during the process of ovulation the first polar body is either forced through a weakened part of the zona or frees itself by amceboid movements and comes to lie outside the zona as described and figured by Van der Stricht 04 The first polar body is usually oval in form and is character ized as found by Van der Stricht 04 in the egg of V noctula by often possessing a little maturation spindle of its own and in other instances having its chromosomes scattered In some of these cases which possess a spindle the first polar body would probably have divided mitotically as observed by Sobotta 95 in the mouse egg and once by Rubaschkin o5 in the egg of the guineapig The polar bodies vary somewhat in size and in one series of ovarian eggs there have been found first polar bodies of about four times the average volume The number of chromo somes in the first polar body is twelve dyads Second Polar Spindle Fig 3 Immediately after the forma tion of the first polar body the twelve dyads remaining in the 26I262 WILLIAM B KIRKHAM egg are drawn into the equator of a new spindle split longitudi nally and the twentyfour daughter univalent chromosomes FIG 3 Ovarian egg showing first polar body and second polar spindle Seven teen masses of chromatin some of which are undivided dyads are scattered through the first polar body twentyfour univalent chromosomes appear in the equator of the second polar spindle Certain chromosomes have becn added from adjacent sections A minute centriole appears at each pole of the second spindle The zona pellucida is represented by a double line X I200  4 Diagram of univalent chromosomes in second polar spindle indicating FIG 4 Diagram of univalent chromosomes in second polar spindle indicating difference in size lengthen out into filaments of various sizes Fig 4 Like the first polar spindle the second varies in size and lies with its axis atTHE MATURATION OF THE MOUSE EGG right angles to the radius of the egg usually near the first polar body Centrioles similar to those described above for the first polar spindle have frequently been observed in second polar spindles and in some cases a few radiating aster fibers have been seen at the poles In attempting to determine whether a given polar spindle is first or second the character of the chromatin has always been found a positive guide K FIG 5 Egg in Fallopian tube showing both polar bodies Note spindle in first polar body The sperm head appears at left the female pronucleus at right in the egg X 1200 Mature eggs which are retained within the ovary together with such as are discharged and fail to be fertilized degenerate with the second polar spindle as found by Rubaschkin o05 in the case of the guineapig egg Second Polar Body Figs 5 and 6  Only one spermatozo6n enters an egg and it carries in most if not all of its tail a fact observed by Van der Stricht 04 in the egg of F noctula When fertilized the egg at once forms its second polar body This is more or less nearly spherical smaller than the first polar body and as stated by Van der Stricht 04 for V noctula generally 263264 WILLIAM B KIRKHAM has its chromosomes gathered into a single compact mass It quickly forms a resting nucleus possessing compact masses of chromatin and is usually the only polar body seen during the early cleavage stages In one instance Fig 6 a second polar body was observed which had just been constricted off and in consequence showed the separate chromosomes twelve in num FIG 6 Egg in Fallopian tube showing second polar body First polar body has disappeared At left in the egg is seen the sperm nucleus and above it the separated tail of the spermatozoon at right appears the egg nucleus surrounded by delicate radiating fibers X 1200 ber and another preparation showed the second polar body form ing the resting nucleus The mouse egg is thus shown to be no exception to the general rule that the maturation process in the metazo6n egg involves the formation of two polar bodies In

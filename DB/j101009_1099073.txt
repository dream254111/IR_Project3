other removals No exception is made in the statute Sec 4 ch 148 Code of 1873 4 ATTACHMENTDeed of trust on property on leased premisesIntention of trustee to remote The trustee in a deed of trust given by the lessor on property after it has been carried on leased premises cannot remove the property from the leased premises without security to the lessor for one years rent He can stand on no higher

OTHER RECENT VIRGINIA DECISIONS but only the duty of ordinary care It may not wilfully injure him but is not obliged to take precautions to prevent injury until it has such notice or belief of his danger as would put a prudent man on the alert The company is not obliged to reduce the speed of its trains nor to stop them whenever an object is seen on the track at a point where it has the exclusive right of way which it has no rea son to believe is but which by possibility may be a human being in peril in order to ascertain what it is And though the object be between its rails and the en gineer of the train observe it in ample time to reduce the speed of the train or stop it and neither blows the whistle rings the bell nor slackens the speed of the train until too late to avoid a collision and such collision occurs resulting in the death of a human being the company is not liable if the engineer and those in charge of the train have no reason to believe and do not in fact believe that the object is animate until within a very short distance of it and then use all the means within their power to avoid such collision without avail RIGGANS ADMR V RIGGANDecided at Richmond April 16 1896 Cardwell J Keith P dissenting 1 TRUSTSParol agreementRevocation of trustHusband to hold wife s property for herSees 2413 2414 and 2840 of Code A valid trust can be created by parol in personalty or the proceeds of real estate and when once created it cannot be subsequently altered or revoked by the party creating it but is governed by the same rules as trusts created in writing A husband and wife may agree by parol that he shall hold for her separate use property acquired by him by virtue of the marriage and if the rights of creditors will not be thereby anected a court of equity will enforce the agreement If the property is her separate estate by virtue of law there is a valuable consideration for the agreement if not and the agree ment is made after marriage the consideration is meritorious In the case in judgment there was such an agreement and it is sufficiently established by proof Sections 2413 2414 and 2840 of the Code have no application to the case 2 SEPARATE ESTATESUncollected choses on April 7 1877Act of limitations between husband and wife Choses in action of a wife remaining uncollected on or after April 7 1877 are the separate estate of the wife though the marriage was previously solemnized and the husband is liable to the wife therefor if he collects them The act of limitations on such collections begins to run against the wife from the time that she has knowledge of such collections CHESAPEAKE  OHIO RAILWAY Co v MOSBYDecided at Rich mond April 16 1896Harrison J 1 CONTRACTSCapacity of parties Weakness of mindCase in judgment The law presumes that every one is capable to contract and exemption from liability for want of such capacity must be strictly established Mere weakness of mind lack of skill or immaturity of judgment in one who has attained full age are not of themselves sufficient to invalidate a contract though taken in connection with other evidence showing a lack of consent and an intention of the other party to overreach they may have that effect The case in judgment falls within the general rule The evidence does not show a lack of legal capacity in the appellee to contract 379

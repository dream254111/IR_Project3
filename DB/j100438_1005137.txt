By Isaac LeaRead before the dmerican Philosophical Society November 2d 18Q7 N the present contribution to the science of Conchology I have endeavoured to be as brief as I thought the subject would permit I have often felt the great inconvenience sustained from too short and indefinite descriptions and am therefore fully sensible of the necessity for the proper distinction of the spe cies of a more minute notice of their characters than is usu ally given In this Mr Barnes has shewn a laudable example and he deserves the acknowledgments of the conchologist It will be observed I have followed his plan of dividing the margin of the disk into eight parts reversing his posterior and anterior margins  Swainson says  Although Lamarck has described so many Uniones the short descriptions he has given and the want of figures to elucidate them render it impossible to determine accurately one half the species which he has enumerated260 SiX NEW SPECIES The genus Unio established by Bruguieres and placed by Cuvier in his fourth class of mollusques les acephales and second family acephales testaces or the mytilaces and by Lamarck in his eleventh class conchiferes first order conchi feres dimyaires thirteenth family les nayades is to the con chologist one of the most interesting of all the genera Re cent American writers on the subject have added many new species to this genus and other new ones are almost daily dis covered I propose now to add six species which I believe to be dis tinct from any hitherto described In doing which I give very exact descriptions accompanied by drawings with a hope they may not hereafter be confounded xvith other species The constant and perplexing changes which the species of this genus assume have led even the accurate Lamarck into the error of describing several varieties as different species and it is not without due hesitation and caution that I am in duced to add the present It has been doubtful with some conchologists whether the species of the genus Unio are not the mere varieties of one speciest To the naturalist who has had the opportunity of examining numerous specimens the gradations are so interesting and at the same time so perplex ing that he is lost in the maze of their changes and he seeks almost in vain to draw a distinctive line between them for even the tuberculated shells sometimes pass by almost insensible gradations into smooth ones Although this line may not always be satisfactorily drawn I think their division into spe cies should be retained if it were only for the sake of system The comparative anatomist finds in the animal of the Unio an organization very far advanced towards a state of perfection Lamarck places it in his scale of perfection higher than in sects and we cannot be surprised at this when we examine its structure and find it possessed of brain heart branchiae  Regne Animal vol ii p 453 t The following genera separated from the genus Unio dipsas Leach hy ria

complete as to excite our greatest admiration Taking the natural position of the animal I have reversed the anterior and posterior margins as used by Linnoeus Bru guieres Lamarck Bosc and others and have followed Cuvier and Blainville That margin which has the ligament be tween it and the beaks is considered by Lamarck as the ante rior margin but it will be found on examination not entitled to be so considered for two reasons 1 The mouth over which is situated the brain is placed in the opposite margin 2 When the animal is in progressive motion this opposite margin is always pointed in the direction of its progress I therefore follow Cuvier in his anterior and posterior margins because they are founded in truth A recent and very accurate writer Blainville gives us so simple an explanation of the position in which a bivalve should be placed that I am induced to extract it He says4 We suppose the shell to cover the animal and that it is passing from the observer the head mouth in front The beaks should be abovethe ligament between the beaks and the observer In this position the opposite side to the beaks would be the base and the two extremes of the perpendicular diameter of this direction would be the one anterior the other posterior Of the habits of this animal we know little future obser vations must open to us an interesting history of them With regard to their food it seems to be a matter of doubt upon what they subsist I have strong reasons to believe they feed upon animalcula which are ever found to exist in water and which they might separate from the constant stream which they pass from the posterior part of the shell and which must be taken in at another part This interesting operation I witnessed frequently in a vessel in which I kept them forsome months If the water was not changed for twentyfour hours I uni formly found my interesting captives perfectly quiet but within  Regne Animal vol ii p 472 VOL III3 U262 SIX NEW SPECIES a few minutes after it was changed they as uniformly com menced the passage of this constant stream J I cannot sup pose this operation to be for the sole purpose of breathing as there is no intermission in the stream of the water and the quantity thrown out is too great for this purpose only I believe it to be the result of the action of the separation of the animalcula from the water Lamarck informs us that the animal of the anadonta which is essentially the same with the unio is hermaphrodite and seems viviparous for the eggs pass into the oviduct placed along the superior branchiae where the young are found with their shells complete In the dissection of an anadonta undu lata nearly three inches long I met with the oviducts charged with about 600000 as nearly as I could calculate young shells perfectly formed both valves being distinctly visible with the microscope There cannot be a doubt that the two pairs of muscles which support the foot and serve by their alternate action to give the animal locomotion are entirely distinct from the great anterior and posterior muscles which seem but to serve the purpose of closing the valves opened by the elasticity of the ligameent The cicatrices of the muscles of the foot ante riorly are placed under the great anterior cicatrix posteriorly overthe great posterior cicatrix and are sometimes confluent with the great cicatrices sometimes entirely distinct from them It is necessary to notice here another set of attaching mus cles which seem to have escaped attention We find on closely examining the region of the cardinal tooth a small ir regular row of muscular impressions In those species which possess large lobed teeth these will be found generally on the inner side of them and somewhat underneath In the more fragile shells possessing comparatively small teeth such as the alatus gracilis c we find these impressions in the cavity of the valve beneath the beaks To this part of the shell I found in many species the animal to be quite strongly attached It seems to serve to support the mantle branchiaeOF THE GENUS UNIO 263 c by the centre and in this certainly serves a very useful purpose Being exceedingly anxious to examine the animals of the various species of the Unio from the Ohio my brother T G Lea kindly sent me thirteen species and many varieties which with the assistance of Mr Stewart were carefully dis sected Those consisted of the species mytiloides and meta nevra of Rafinesque siliquoideus triangularis gibbosus and cornutus of Barnes purpureus alatus ovatus of Say E sopus of Green irroratus and ellipsis now first described This ex amination furnished me with several interesting results It con firmed me entirely in my belief that the bviducts of the irro ratus were different from any other species yet examined a drawing and description of which will be found in this paper The prolongation of the sacks of the oviducts is peculiarly interesting In some of the varieties of the cornutus which seem to run into the AEsopus we found the posterior and infe rior parts of the shell uninaturally extended The mark of the animal on the shell had its usually curved shape while the mantle quite callous extended to a protruded and irregu lar margin It has been a matter of speculation how the calcareous matter was secreted to increase the outer margin of the teeth as well as their whole surface In this examination we found the surface of the broad teeth some of which were near half an inch thick to be completely covered with a prolongation of the mantle extending from the great anterior to the great posterior cicatrix so that when the teeth closed they completely enveloped it This part of the mantle is exceedingly thin and transparent In the study of this genus we are naturally attracted by the beautiful rays which frequently are found in the epidermis This to the unpractised eye would seem to be a sufficiently distinctive characteristic to mark a species There is however no character more fleeting and various The young of many species uniformly possess rays and we sometimes find fine adult specimens of extreme beauty The264 SIX NEW SPECIES naturalist is therefore obliged to abandon this character as al most useless In noticing the colouring of the epidermis we must not pass unobserved the peculiar spots which are found on the cylindricus of Say the metanevra of Rafinesque and triangularis of Barnes These have generally the form of an arrowhead but sometimes so much elongated as to form rays The hair like rays of the cornutus of Barnes and its varieties are peculiarly beautiful in fresh and perfect speci mens and the spotted lines covering the irroratus over its whole disk will yield to none of the painted epidermides In the measurements I have adopted the plan of Barnes the greatest transverse line is the breadth the greatest line perpendicular to this is the length and the greatest line per pendicular to those lines that is from the most ventricose part of one valve to the most ventricose part of the other is the diameter We thus have the three greatest measure ments of the shell and the marginal descriptions give the form It should be remembered that different localities pro duce various sizes and even the thickness of the shell is frequently changed from this circumstance In considering the word Unio as of the masculine gen der I have followed the American conchologists in oppo sition to Lamarck and other Europeans who consider it as feminine Ainsworth in that part of his dictionary ap propriated to pure Latinity gives the following definition Unio onis m ab unus quod in conchis nulli duo reperi antur indiscreti i e similes d pearl called a union because many being found in one shell not any of them is like the other Plin 9 35 Unionum conchw mother ofpearl Suet Ner 31 In Ainsworths Index Vocum Vitandarum is to be found the following definition Unio onis f quod unum facit Union concord agree nment the number of one Theol In this latter sense it must be masculine as ternio senio c J C i J C John Carey the editor of the last edition of Ainsworths quarto dic tionaryOF THE GENUS UNIO 265 It is evident that the word explained by the former of these definitions is the most proper to express a genus of shells and consequently in Conchology the word Unio is masculine 1 UNIO CALCEOLUS Plate III fig 1

RemarksThis curious little shell is peculiar in its promi nent curved tooth shutting in before that of the other valve VOL III3 X266 SIX NEW SPECIES Its nacre is uncommonly silvery It swells considerably along the posterior umbonial slope This causes its greatest diame ter to be semidistant between the beaks and posterior margin I have given a view of the right valve of this shell for the purpose of exhibiting its remarkable tooth It might at first be considered as a malformation but in the three specimens which I have seen this character has been uniform The calceolus approaches as nearly in its general appearance to the donaciformis as to any other species It is however a thinner shell and differs in the teeth as well as the colour of the epidermis 2 UNIo LANCEOLATUS Plate III

RemarksThis species which I have seen only in Tar River N C approaches more closely to the unio picto rum of Europe than any yet discovered in this country When I first found it I felt assured it was the same but upon closer examination and comparison find it to be essen tially different The cavity of the beak is much less and the cardinal tooth shorter and more lobed 3 UNIO DONACIFORMIS Plate IV

closely together as scarcely to admit the edge of a piece of fine paper In its most prominent character the peculiar angulated slope it most resembles the ovatus of Say but differs greatly in the size the ovatus being four or five inches in breadth and very much more inflated The latter has a double car dinal tooth in each valve the donaciformis only in the left valve 4 UNIo ELLIPSIS Plate IV fig 4

pearly white and silvery RemarksThe very minute and delicate spotted lines which pass from the beaks to the margin of this species well characterize it They are so fine and approach so nearly to each other as to give a general olive appearance to the disk the ground of which is really yellow I have not observed this to pervade completely the surface of any other spe cies and in this it is constant The substance of the shell is exceedingly massive and ponderous more so for its size than any other species which I have seen The animal is the only one in the organization of which during my examination of this genus I have been able to detect any essential differ ence From the shell being longitudinal and peculiarly mas sive we might be led to suspect a conformation different from the other species anid such is the case By the exertion of nmy brother T G Lea I have been for tunate enouglh to obtain three individuals of this species in a state of impregnation considerably developed In those I ob served an appendage in form of a depressed cone attached to the branchiw on either side and a very slight examination fully satisfied me these were the oviductsOF THE GENUS UNIO 17 1 In all the other species which I have examined I have found the ovaries and oviducts as described by Cuvier Bosc Ca rus c The oviducts in these lie in a direct line between the two great muscles and are attached to the upper pair of branchia In the irroratus this space is so small as is also the cavity that it seems to require a different conformation to accommodate the oviducts and thus we find them pendent and not placed along the plane of the branchiaw The long sacks containing the ova are inserted about half way up the branchiae and somewhat posterior to the centre The num ber of these sacks in mny three specimens consists of eight in two and seven in the other The posterior sack is the outer or surrounding one and measured two inches  the second and fourth 22 the third 24 the fifth 1 9 the sixth 1P6 the seventh 1 4 In diameter the sacks are nearly the same size the interior ones being ratLher smaller than the exterior which measures onetwentieth of an inch These measurements were effected by separating the mem branes which connect the sacks together and stretching them out The diameter of the cone is 6 its elevation 2 of an inch The outer sack terminates after making one revolu tion the second advances onethird on the succeeding reve lution and each succeeding one obeys the same law until the last terminates in the centre and the mass having performed three revolutions the whole formns a depressed cone This curious arrangement of the sacks to form the depres sed cone which has its base resting on the region of the sto mach is admirably calculated by the economy of nature to harmonize with the construction of shell which presents only at the centre of its disks room for the essential purpose of propagation See plate V Fig 6 represents the interior fig

of the tubercles is very peculiar and they distinctly mark this fine species The specimen represented in the drawing is the largest of five which I have seen This species is more nearly allied to the metanevra of Rafinesque than to any other It differs however essen tially in its having a greater number and more distinct tuber cles its colour and the tuberculous ridge of the latter being replaced by a smooth furrow enlarging from the beaks to the posterior basal margin and bordered by two rows of small tu bercles The metanevra is also larger and more ponderous VOL 1113 Z SU 7 1 Unt7io

REVIEW A JOURNAL OF SECONDARY EDUCATION UNIVERSITY INSPECTION OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND THE SCHOOLS EXAMINATION BOARD OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY Hitherto the universities and colleges of the country have shown little direct interest in the aims and methods of secondary education Such coiperation as the colleges offered has concen trated attention upon the college admission requirements to the neglect of other important considerations For generations the colleges have made their entrance requirements and the schools have met them in accordance with a tacit understanding that this arrangement was proper and desirable But there the direct in fluence of the colleges on the schools ceased Indeed the sec ondary schools generally speaking have for a long time cher ished the conviction that any interest in secondary education shown by the colleges could have no other direct aim than a pro posed modification of college preparatory courses or of existing plans for admission to college in the interests of the colleges themselves This conviction is on the whole just for it is evi dent enough that most of the attempts at closer affiliation of col leges and secondary schools hitherto proposed by the colleges have not aimed directly at the improvement of secondary educa tion as such but at the elevation of the colleges through such im provements in the secondary schools as the successful operation of the various plans for admission to college viz by examina tions by diplomas or by certificates from accredited schools might bring about Of these three plans the examinations have been most effective in producing a real co6peration in the interests of secondary eduThe School Review cation But there are different kinds of examinations When the demands of an examination can be satisfied quantitatively only or when the demands of the examination can be satisfied by skilful coaching without skilful teaching it is evident that the cobperation of colleges and secondary schools promoted by such ex aminations necessarily affects favorably only the range of the subjects taught and the extent to which each subject required by the college is pursued but does not necessarily affect favorably the teaching of those subjects and the general tone of the school On the other hand when examinations are so planned as to test the quality as well as the quantity of the results of school work the school necessarily co6perates with the college in the interests of secondary education so far at least as the subjects required by the colleges are concerned Even such examinations however have sometimes been regarded by the schools as an obstruction to be evaded and not as a means of guiding teachers and pupils to do better work In such cases there is no real co6peration in the interests of education true educational interests are sacri ficed by such schools in systematic efforts to overcome the obstacle set up by the college with the least expenditure of force by school and pupil Again neither admission by diplomas nor admission by certifi cates from accredited schools is well adapted to promote any real coiperation between colleges and secondary schools in promoting the interests of secondary education Theoretically this statement does not apply to the diploma plan for in this plan the inspection of a school by one or more officers of the university involves the actual presence of the university officers at the school and this always implies a degree of co6peration in the interests of the school itself But the large number of schools accredited to the universities that have adopted the diploma plan of admission and the distance of many of those schools from the universities them selves have often especially in recent times reduced actual in spection to the visit of a single officer making a comparatively brief stay Under such circumstances there can be little real cooperation for the improvement of the school itself except once moreas regards the range of the course of study and the extent to which each subject is pursued both deter mined however by the college admission requirements Further 258University Inspection of Secondary Schools the actual inspection of a school has not always been a necessary part of this diploma plan of admission to college At least two respectable universities one of them a large and influential insti tution are known by me to have accepted the diplomas of gradu ates of high schools without any approach to an inspection of the schools concerned This extension of the diploma plan is not uncommon in some portions of the country and it then does not differ materially from the certificate plan of admitting students to college This latter plan indeed makes no pretensions to influ encing the secondary schools except in relation to the college ad mission requirements It is well known how widely American colleges and universities have adopted the practice of establishing accredited secondary schools either by the diploma or by the certificate plan and it is evident that with this great extension of the plan of accredited schools the influence of the higher institutions on the secondary schools has become less and less direct and that under it anything like real co6peration between colleges and secondary schools does not exist except in the particulars already mentioned more than once namely that the accredited schools do in most instances organize their courses of study so as to satisfy quantitatively the requirements of the institutions to which they are accredited Different in important respects is the aim of the affiliation of colleges and secondary schools promoted by such organizations as the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools and the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Mid dle states and Maryland The New England association has nat urally paid much attention to college admission requirements and no doubt it always will But the avowed aim of the association is  the advancement of the cause of liberal education by the promo tion of interests common to colleges and preparatory schools But even this association as its name implies regards the sec ondary schools in the first instance as  preparatory schools and only secondly as in a sense independent educational institu tions with a distinct sphere of activity peculiar to themselves Moreover the New England Association of Colleges and Prepar atory Schools though effective in bringing about a real coopera tion of the two educational forces concerned necessarily deals with general considerations whose main influence like the other 259The School Review plans of cooperation already discussed is only felt if at all in the aims and organization of the schools rather than in their work The association can have little direct influence on the schools and often its influence does not reach the schools at all That this must be true will be apparent when one remembers that many schools are not represented at all or with little regularity in the meetings of the association that the meetings cannot be at tended by many teachers not principals and that the admirable proceedings of the association though printed each year are in all probability not read by many of those who would be especially benefitted American secondary school teachers are not as a rule much addicted to reading professional literature even the best It thus appears as was stated at the outset that the main in fluence of such cooperation as has existed heretofore between the colleges and secondary schools has concentrated attention on col lege admission requirements and further that while such influ ence has usually been of value in enriching the course of study in secondary schools it has had more direct reference to the pupils career in college than to his work in school On the other hand increased attention to college admission requirements has some times been positively harmful by leading a school to work chiefly in the interests of the few pupils who were going to college to the disadvantage of the majority or by transforming it into an insti tution which merely prepares pupils to meet the college entrance re quirements without any thought of the educational value of the subjects taught or of the methods employed Finally none of the plans of cooperation proposed thus far have carried the influ ence of the colleges into individual schools in the most effective way i e so as to make the schools selfcritical in respect to their aims and methods and conscious of their separate educa tional responsibilities This brings me to the real topic which I am to discuss namely university inspection or examination of secondary schools irre spective of college admission requirements an examination cover ing the organization aims and actual work of each school exam ined and intended to ascertain the merits and defects of the school as an educational institution so that possessing the nec essary information the university may by criticism and sugges tion co6perate with the school in its efforts after improvement 260University Inspection of Secondary Schools A little while ago I said that the secondary schools had become convinced that any proposal from the colleges whatever its apparent aim could only bear on the question of college admission requirements That does not state the whole truth Not only have the schools firmly held the opinion just stated but many of them do not see how any possible advantage could arise from an inspection or examination by officers of the university which did not directly affect the admission to college of graduates of the in spected schools When the schools examination board of Har vard university was established and correspondents were told that the proposed inspections called examinations of schools under the direction of this board had nothing to do with college admission requirements or with plans of getting their pupils into college many of them in astonishment simply said cui bono and became indifferent University inspection was regarded by such schools as a luxury that might be harmless if indulged in moder ately but not as a plan of cooperation that could really bring the resources of the university to bear on the secondary schools in an important and useful way It took a little time for the schools to realize that the plan proposed concerned itself primarily with the interests of secondary education as such and only incidentally with preparation for college that is that the aim throughout is to serve the best interests of the pupils themselves Is it not strange by the way that we have come to speak of preparation for college and of secondary education as if they were two dis tinct kinds of education We say of the high school that it  fits for life and that it also fits for college We began to use such expressions when the only road to college was by way of the classics and we have finished by separating in thought and some times in practice two ideas between which there is no valid dis tinction For whether a youth studies classics and mathematics or science and modern languages he is inevitably preparing for life or missing such preparation as the case may be whether he goes to college or not The schools examination board of Harvard university was established a little more than a year ago The board comprises  These paragraphs describing the organization and work of the schools examination board follow very closely the circular of the board pub lished by the university 26l262 The School Review representatives from both the secondary schools and the univer sity and consists of the president four professors and two prin cipals of secondary schools Under the direction of this board any school public endowed or private of a grade to prepare boys for Harvard college or the Lawrence Scientific school is on request thoroughly examined An examination may cover the entire work of a school or only the work in a department or departments specified in the application for an examination Ex aminations are invited by the master of a public school with the approval of the superintendent if there be any by the master or principal of an endowed school or academy with the approval of some appropriate officer of the board of trustees and by the master of a private school When a school invites an examination the university is thereby asked to give to the school a friendly criticism of its aims organ ization equipment and work Inasmuch as the distribution of the work among the teacherswhether by the departments or otherwisethe order and distribution of the subjects in the course of study the discipline and the general tone of the school have much to do with the efficiency of a school these matters as well as the work in detail of each department are carefully consid ered in each examination To make a complete examination of a school which has a com prehensive programme of studies six examiners are ordinarily re quiredone for each of the following subjects classics mathe matics natural science history English and other modern languages Sometimes a school in its application asks specific ally for an examination into its organization In that case an ex aminer may be appointed to consider especially that feature of the school If the number of pupils be large assistants for the principal examiners are also required The examinations in the different departments are not usually simultaneous although two examiners may sometimes visit a school on the same days Ordi narily not less than two days at a school are required by each examiner When requested the board states beforehand how many examiners and assistants will be needed for either a partial or a complete examination Each examiner makes a complete re port in writing to the board and on the basis of these reports a confidential report is made by the board to the master or prinUniversity Inspection of Secondary Schools cipal of the school examined By agreement this report must not be published by either party It may however be used con fidentially in the university committees on admission in the board of trustees of an endowed school or academy and by the superintendent of schools if there be any in the case of a public school No report or record is made of the attainments of indi vidual pupils Since the object of an examination is to subject the aims the organization the equipment and the efficiency of a school to thorough scrutiny and frank discussion the examination can not be exclusively nor especially directed to ascertaining the attain ments of the pupils It does not therefore consist chiefly of written or oral tests to which the pupils are subjected although such tests may enter into the examination at the discretion of the examiner The application to pupils of such tests would not require the presence of the examiner in person In accord ance with the intentions of the schools examinations board each examiner goes to ascertain by personal inspection the range and quality of the instruction and the use made of library labora tories apparatus text and reference books to note the meth ods of teaching and the habits of the classes to catch the spirit of the place to feel its influence and to judge of the effect of that influence in shaping the intellectual habits and the charac ters of the pupils Such an examination accordingly covers the teachers as well as the pupils The examinations may or may not cover methods of discipline outside of the schoolrooms and they do not cover religious instruction sanitary condition or arrange ments for boarding and lodging pupils The cost of an examina tion depends on whether a complete or a partial examination is asked for and also on the distance of the school from the uni versity The method of an examination is in substance as follows In his instructions from the board each examiner is informed that while it is expected that the examination of a school will be searching it is also expected that it will be conducted in the most friendly and helpful spirit further that he is expected to inform himself beforehand concerning the course of study and daily pro gramme of the school so far as they relate to his own subject At the school each examiner is expected to confer with the principal 263The School Review and through the principal to make himself known to all the teachers directly affected by his visit He is expected in all cases to observe the ordinary work of the school teaching examin ing experimenting etc in progress he may also in his discretion with the concurrence of the principal and teachers examine pupils or classes orally A satisfactory amount of the written work which has been done in the ordinary routine of the school is examined and exam iners may also themselves propose questions to be answered by the pupils in writing Suchtests should not ordinarily require much time and all mechanical details should be arranged by the teacher of the class Each examiner if he thinks it necessary may employ an assist ant for the examination of written work To save expense to the schools it is recommended that this written work be examined in Cambridge Each examiner makes a full report to the board This is a confidential report intended for the board alone and covers 1 The proportionate attention which the school gives to the examiners subject and its relative weight in determining a pupils advancement 2 The quality and range of the books used 3 The equipment of the school as regards library laboratories and apparatus 4 The scholarship and the professional training or experience of the teachers 5 The aims and methods of the teachers 6 The tests employed for teaching purposes or for promotion 7 The general atmosphere of the schoolwhether kindly in spiring and refining or otherwise On the basis of such examiners reports the board makes its re port to the school A list of the schools examined with the dates of the examinations and the departments in which they were examined is printed in each successive annual catalogue of the university accompanied by the statement that this publication conveys no information in respect to the results of the examina tion 264University Inspection of Secondary Schools Now what reasons may be given for the belief that such an ex amination may promote the cause of liberal education in sec ondary schools and colleges First The inspections or examinations directed by the schools examination board are disinterested in character Neither the uni versity nor an inspected school can by the mutual agreement under which an examination takes place derive from the examina tion any kind of immediate popular approval By the terms of this agreement the results of an examination are embodied in a confidential report to the master or principal of the school As this report cannot be published by either party it is impossible to make capital out of it for any external advantage Second The disinterested and confidential character of the ex aminations makes it possible for the school to subject itself to the examination without reserve and for the university to do its part with perfect frankness The board through its examiners can therefore know the school just as it is It is only on the basis of such a thorough knowledge of the school that any commendations or recommendations made by the board can have real value Third This knowledge on which the board bases its commenda tions and its recommendations is obtained through several exam iners for each school Each of the examiners brings the resources of a specialist to bear on his examination Moreover since the examinations in different departments are seldom simultaneous the examinations reveal the condition of the school as a whole and of its different departments at different times and under dif ferent circumstances The conditions under which the board obtains its knowledge of a school are therefore conducive to accuracy and completeness and tend to prevent as perfectly as may be the acceptance of merely temporary or accidental char acteristics as essential features of the school Fourth Such examinations usually lead to conferences sought by the principal and teachers during the examiners visit or after wards and in this way the ideas of the university teachers are brought directly into the schools in an intimate and helpful way It may be said in passing that some schools were at first sceptical in regard to the capacity of college teachers to appre ciate the merits and defects of secondary schools No doubt such scepticism still exists though the board has reason to believe 265The School Review that the experience of the past year has lessened it The efficiency of college men as examiners depends in part no doubt upon the fact that many of them have had experience as teachers in secondary schools Fifth The inspection benefits the university as well as the schools The university learns how much the secondary schools can do and do well to meet the college admission requirements and how difficult it is in small schools to combine college and noncol lege preparatory courses It thus learns the capabilities needs and difficulties of the secondary schools and on the basis of the good mutual understanding which such knowledge promotes both are better able to work together in the interests of a liberal education Sixth Finally such university inspection as I have described focuses the attention both of the university and the secondary schools examined on educational aims It therefore guards against the tendency to make secondary education synonymous with preparation for college admission requirements and converges the efforts of both school and college on the endeavor to define the aims of secondary education and to find the means best adapted to accomplish those aims No one will doubt the importance of just aims clearly conceived Without such aims the work of a school is sure to lack definiteness and vigor Now is it going too far to say that the most common defect of the work of our secondary schools is its aimlessness due to an in adequate conception of what should be done in secondary educa tion and how it should be done The educational horizon of most secondary school teachers is limited by the subjects they have to teach Even the most conscientious among them usually regard themselves as teachers of subjects instead of teachers of minds by means of subjects The pupils early education should have opened his mind it should have made him receptive and eager to extend his knowledge and to try his power in fresh fields it should have exploited and developed many intellectual interests and should have begun the unification of these interests by mak ing each of them manysided All this should lead to the begin ning of a mental and moral stability alertness and vigor the development of which it is the function of the secondary school to promote The pupils secondary education therefore begins before he enters the high school and continues throughout the 266University Inspection of Secondary Schools entire high school period During that period the pupil should be led to find for himself what his tastes and capacities really are This is the period of dawning and developing mental and moral selfconsciousnessthe period when the pupil should be gradually led to emancipate himself from intellectual and moral guidance and authority and to assume wisely the independent control of his own development to determine intelligently his own future This emancipation and selfrevelation is the main function of secondary education and on its fulfilment depends very largely the pupils subsequent progress happiness and usefulness When a youth enters college the burden of deliberate choice choice with reasonsis intentionally and repeatedly laid upon him Without this reiterated choice with the consciousness of personal responsibility there can be no real mental and moral development there can be no approximation to that mental and moral stability alertness and vigor to which I referred a moment ago and which is the final aim of all education If a youth does not go to college the duties of life inevitably thrust the burden of choice upon him at once and continually With the comple tion of the period assigned to secondary education a youth should be prepared to choose deliberately he should face the world with modesty but with the consciousness of power to achieve and interest in achievement and with the determination to become one who while performing his private duties and enjoying what ever leisure he may earn is also to be a participator in the worlds affairs and to work with his fellow men for the continuous im provement and happiness of the race This interest in achievement this consciousness of power and this determination to contribute something be it little or much to the happiness and prosperity of the race the university aims to extend to deepen and to strengthen Is it not desirable that the university and the secondary schools should cooperate in the en deavor to attain such a consummation Paul H Hanus Harvard University 267

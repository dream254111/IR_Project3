J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107723,A LETTER FROM LEWIS WESTON DILLWYN ESQ ADDRESSED TO SIR HUMPHRY DAVY BART P R S,I206979,C 413 J XXI A LETTER FROM LEWIS WESTON DILLWYN ESQ ADDRESSED TO SIR HUMPHRY DAVY BART P R S READ MARCH 25 I824 MY DEAR SIR T HROUGH YOU I BEG LEAVE TO OFFER TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY SOME FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE RELATIVE PERIODS AT WHICH DIFFERENT FAMILIES OF TESTACEOUS ANIMALS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CREATED AND ON THE GRADUAL APPROXIMATION WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN OUR BRITISH STRATA FROM THE FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE OLDEST FORMATIONS TO THE LIVING INHABITANTS OF OUR LAND AND WATERS THE SERIES OF STRATA BEGINNING WITH TRANSITION LIME AND ENDING WITH LIAS CONTAINS SHELLS BELONGING TO VARIOUS GENERA OF CONCHIFERA CEPHALOPODA ANNELIDES AND HERBIVOROUS TRA CHELIPODA AND ALSO SOME OTHER SHELLS AS FOR INSTANCE THE MULTILOCULAR AND SPIRIFEROUS BIVALVES WHICH CANNOT BE REFERRED TO EITHER OF THOSE NATURAL ORDERS OR GROUPS OF GENERA INTO WHICH ALL THE OTHER TESTACEA BOTH RECENT AND FOSSIL HAVE BEEN DIVIDED IN THE SIMPLE BIVALVES BELONGING TO THESE STRATA THE MARKS WHICH BEST SERVE TO DISTINGUISH THEIR FAMILIES ARE GENERALLY OBLITERATED AND BUT LITTLE MORE CAN WITH ANY CER TAINTY BE OBSERVED THAN THAT THE TWO ORDERS INTO WHICH LA MARK HAS DIVIDED THEM HAVE EXISTED TOGETHER THROUGHOUT EVERY FORMATION FROM TRANSITION ROCKS TO THE PRESENT DAY AN EXAMINATION OF THE FEW PERFECT SPECIMENS WHICH I HAVE MET WITH HOWEVER LEADS ME TO SUSPECT THAT ALL THE DIMYAIRIAMR DILLWYN ON FOSSIL SHELLS OF THESE STRATA HAVE THE LIGAMENT EXTERNAL AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT INTERNAL LIGAMENTS WERE CONFINED TO THE MONOMYAIRIA TILL AFTER THE LIAS HAD BEEN DEPOSITED IN THE SECONDARY BEDS ABOVE THE LIAS ALL THE SHELLS MAY BE REFERRED TO SOME OF OUR NOW EXISTING ORDERS OF ANIMALS AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE UNKNOWN ORDERS IS IMMEDIATELY FOL LOWED BY THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF ANOTHER ORDER OF MOLLUSCA TO WHICH LAMARCK HAS LIMITED THE NAME OF GASTEROPODA AND AS WAS FIRST SUGGESTED TO ME BY MR MILLER ALL THOSE FOSSILS OF THE OLDER STRATA WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO BE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CASTS OF PATELLAE WERE OBVIOUSLY FORMED IN THE CONCAVE SIDES OF THE VERTEBRA OR BY THE INTERVERTEBRAL CARTI LAGES OF A FISH AS A FEW OF THE CARNIVOROUS TRACHELIPODA ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE OOLITES THEIR FIRST APPEAR ANCE MAY PROBABLY BE REFERRED TO THE SAME EPOCH BUT I HAVE NOT MYSELF BEEN ABLE TO DETECT EITHER OF THE FAMILIES OF THIS SECTION OF TRACHELIPODA IN ANY SECONDARY BED EXCEPTING THE DENUDED TRACTS OF GREEN SAND IN DEVONSHIRE AND THERE PER FORATIONS EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH ABOUND AMONG TER TIARY AND RECENT SHELLS ARE ALSO OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER MET WITH ANY SUCH PERFORATION IN ANY OTHER SECONDARY FORMATION NOR EVEN IN ANY OF THOSE REGULAR BEDS OF GREEN SAND WHICH ACTUALLY UNDERLIE THE CHALK IN OTHER COUNTIES I AM NOT ENOUGH OF A GEOLOGIST TO DECIDE AS TO WHETHER ANY ADMIXTURE OF SECONDARY AND TERTIARY FOSSILS MAY POSSIBLY HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHEN THESE DENUDATIONS WERE MADE BUT I CAN IN NO OTHER WAY ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT ALL THE SPECIES WHICH HAVE BEEN PERFORATED AS WELL AS THE CARNI VOROUS TRACHELIPODES THEMSELVES ARE NEARLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE LONDON CLAY AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY 414MR DILLWYN ON FOSSIL SHELLS SUCHPERFORATION IN EITHER OF THOSE SPECIES WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE MORE REGULAR BEDS OF GREEN ISAND AND WHICH ARE SOME TIMES MIXED WITH THEM THESE PERFORATIONS MAY BE READILY DISTINGUISHED FROM THOSE MORE OBLIQUE AND LATERAL BURROW INGS WHICH ARE OFTEN FOUND IN SECONDARY FOSSILS AND ARE AL WAYS CONVENIENTLY FORMED FOR SUCTION BY BEING BROADEST IN THE OUTER SURFACE AND GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THAT IPART OF THE SHELL WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY OVER THE ANIMAL WHEREAS IN THE LATTER THE HOLES ARE CYLINDRICAL ANDMUCH SMORE RESEMBLE THE INDISCRIMINATE BURROWINGS WHICH ARE COMMON IN RECENT OYSTER SHELLS IN MY FORMER LETTER WHICHTHE ROYAL SOCIETY HASDONE ME THE HONOUR TO PUBLISH IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF LAST YEAR I HAVE POINTED OUT SOMIE OF THE CHANGES WHICH TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CHALK FORMATION WAS COMPLETED AND OF THE BRITISH STRATA IT MAY BE FURTHER OBSERVED THAT IT IS ONLY IN THE TERTIARY BEDS THAT ANY TRACES OF THE CIRRHIPEDA OR OF ANY OF THE FAMILIES OF NAKED MOLLUSCA HAVE BEEN FOUND THE BEAK WHICH HAS BEEN FIGURED BY BLUMENBACH AND WHICH AMONG THE FOSSILS OF THE LIAS IS MENTIONED BY CONY BEARE AND PHILLIPS AS THE BEAK OFO A SEPIA BELONGED AS I THINK UNQUESTIONABLY TO THE CEPHALOPODE ANIMAL OF AN AM MONITE AND IT SUFFICIENTLY RESEMBLES THE LOWER MANDIBLE OF THE PARROTLIKE BEAK WHICH RTUOPHWS HAS DESCRIBED OF NAU TILUS POMPILIUS AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED IF THESE MANDIBLES OR RATHER CASTS OF MANDIBLES BELONG TO THE AMMONITES THEY DIFFER GENERICALLY IN SHAPE FROM THOSE OF EVERY LIVING GENUS OF CHEPHALOPODA WHICH HAS BEENFIGURED OR DESCRIBED AND I HAVE FOUND THEM IN ALL THOSE BEDS AND SO FAR AS I CAN 415MR DILLWYN ON FOSSIL SHELLS ASCERTAIN THEY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THOSE BEDS ONLY OF THE LIAS LOWER OOLITE AND CHALK WHICH CONTAIN THE LARGER AMMONITES FROM THE GREATER TENUITY OF THESE BEAKS IN THE SMALLER SPECIES THEY MAY PROBABLY HAVE YIELDED TO PRESSURE AND DECAY BEFORE THE MUD WHICH FILLED THEM HAD BECOME SUFFICIENTLY HARD TO RETAIN THEIR SHAPES AND AS THE LOWER MANDIBLES OF THE CEPHALOPODA ARE ALWAYS MUCH LARGER AND THICKERTHEN THE UPPER ONES THE NONAPPEARANCE OF ANY OF THE LATTER MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE SAME WAY THE SEPIAE ARE MOREOVER FURNISHED WITH ONE OF THOSE THICK DORSAL PLATES WHICH ARE COMMONLY CALLED CUTTLEFISH BONES AND MOST IF NOT ALL THE OTHER SEPIADSE CONTAIN AN INTERNAL HORNY SUBSTANCE OF THE SAME NATURE WHICH IS GENERALLY AT LEAST AS THICK AND DURABLE AS THE MANDIBLES AND IF THE FOSSIL BEAKS OF THE SECONDARY STRATA BELONGED TO THIS FAMILY THEN IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME OF THE DORSAL PLATES WOULD BE FOUND WITH THEM BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN ANY OLDER BRITISH STRATUM THAN THE LONDON CLAY SO FAR FROM BEING ABLE TO DETECT ANY TRACES OF THE NAKED MOLLUSCA I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND IN THE SECONDARY STRATA EITHER OF THOSE SHELLS BY WHICH THE ANIMAL IS ONLY PARTIALLY COVERED NOR ANY OF THOSE OF THE CONVOLUTAE WHICH NECESSARILY CHANGE THEIR SHELLS AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THEIR GROWTH AND OF WHICH THE ANIMAL MUST THEREFORE OCCASIONALLY REMAIN EXPOSED TILL A FRESH COAT OF CALCAREOUS MATTER HAS BEEN SECRETED IN MY FORMER LETTER I HAVE STATED THAT ALL THE MARINE SPIRIVALVES OF THE SECONDARY STRATA BELONG TO OPERCULATED GENERA AND THESE OBSERVATIONS SERVE STILL MORE STRIKINGLY TO PROVE THAT TILL THE CHALK DEPOSITS WERE COMPLETED THE MOLLUSCA IN OUR 416MR DILLWYN ON FOSSIL SHELLS LATITUDE REQUIRED A MORE PERFECT PROTECTION EITHER FROM THEIR ENEMIES OR FROM THE SURROUNDING ELEMENT THAN AFTERWARDS BECAME NECESSARY THE SAME GRADUAL APPROXIMATION TOWARDS RECENT SHELLS WHICH MAY BE TRACED IN THE OLDER STRATA IS ALSO CARRIED ON THROUGH THE TERTIARY FORMATIONS AND THE AFFINITY WHICH IS COMPLETE WITH RESPECT TO ORDERS IN SECONDARY BEDS ABOVE THE LIAS BECOMES FURTHER EXTENDED AND EVERY TERTIARY SHELL MAY BE REFERRED TO SOME EXISTING GENUS BUT THOUGH THE AP PROXIMATION HAS PROCEEDED THUS FAR IN THE LONDON CLAY YET ALL ITS IMMENSELY NUMEROUS SPECIES ARE NOW EXTINCT AND IT IS ONLY IN THOSE UPPERMOST BEDS OF CRAG WHICH LIE BETWEEN THE LONDON CLAY AND OUR PRESENT CREATION THAT ANY FOSSIL CAN BE COMPLETELY IDENTIFIED WITH A LIVING SPECIES THE SHELLS WHICH MAY BE THUS IDENTIFIED ARE HOWEVER MIXED WITH MANY EXTINCT SPECIES AND THOUGH THE FOSSILS OF THE CRAG APPEAR GENERALLY TO HAVE BELONGED TO A WARMER CLIMATE THAN OURS YET THEIR CHARACTER IS MUCH LESS TROPICAL THAN THOSE OF THE LONDON CLAY AND IN EVERY RESPECT THEY ALL APPROACH NEARER TO THE PRESENT INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH COASTS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THAT THE SHELLS OF UNKNOWN FAMILIES ARE CONFINED TO THE BEDS BELOW THE LOWER OOLITE AND IN ALL THE UPPER FORMATIONS A RELATIONSHIP IS COMPLETED BETWEEN FOSSIL AND RECENT SHELLS IN THE FOLLOWING REGULARLY APPROXIMATING SERIES IN THE SECONDARY STRATA ABOVE THE LIAS AS TO NATURAL ORDERS IN THE LONDON CLAY AS TO GENERA AND PARTIALLY AS TO SPECIES IN THE CRAG THESE OBSERVATIONS REFER EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ANIMALS OF THE GTH LOTH IITH LATH AND ISTH CLASSES OF INVERTEBRATA IN LAMARCKS ARRANGEMENT AND WHETHER THE SAME SORT OF MDCCCXXIV 3 H 417418 QMR DILLWYN ONFOSSIL SHELLS REGULARLY APPROXIMATING AFFINITY CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE OTHER CLASSES I MUST LEAVE IT FOR THOSE WHO ARE MORE CON VERSANT WITH THEM TO DECIDE I REMAIN MY DEAR SIR VERY FAITHFULLY YOURS L W DILLWYN PENLKERGARE EB I 18Z4 SIR HUMPHRY DAVY BART PRS C C

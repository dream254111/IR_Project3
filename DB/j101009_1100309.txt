shall take effect from its passage and the term of the first judge elected hereunder shall commence on the first day of February nineteen hundred and seven Evils of Present Land Laws 1 Only evidences of title are recorded Hence all the evidence must be examined every time and the difficulty danger and labor increases with every transfer This causes increasing delays and costs besides augmented uncertainties 2 Much important evidence is not recorded but is altogether in pais particularly evidence concerning the true heirs of decedents This adds to uncertainties and fills the past with ghosts that not only haunt but fre quently take actual possession of lands transferred to their detriment 3 There is no proof of the genuineness of signatures to deeds Forgeries are easy 4 There is no certainty of identity of parties The examiner relies wholly upon seeming identity shown by index of deeds But there may be many John Smiths 5 There is no proof of delivery of deed It may have been executed as an escrow 6 There is no proof of legal capacity of parties at time deed was deliv ered 7 No certainty about marriage or divorce Rights of dower and curtesy 8 Lands may be subject to rights by adverse possession or prescrip tion of which there is absolutely no record 9 Rights may arise under wills not required to be recorded for seven years 10 Rights may arise under wills impeached or established within two years after ex parte probate and the statute gives an additional reserva tion in favor of infants and nonresidents 11 There is no certainty about boundaries under our present system 12 Pocket deeds may be recorded within ten days and will relate back to date This reduces every transfer to a matter of confidence in the grantor unless the purchase money is withheld 13 The loss of title by eminent domain may not appear by ordinary examination11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 14 Loss of title by reversal of decree of court may not be shown by the deed books 15 Conflict of patents and interlocks will not appear by ordinary exami nation The chain may be faultless while the original link is worthless 16 Indexes are imperfect and fatal mistakes may be made by reason of omissions and other defects 17 It is not even necessary that deeds should be recorded or indexed at all They are binding and serve as constructive notice to all the world from the time when lodged for record with the clerk 99 Va 460 18 Court titlesthose passing through suitsare the most uncertain of all Questions of proper parties and procedure must be determined by each examiner 19 Ceaseless examination of title entailing delay and expense 20 Titles dependent upon the opinion of each examiner Doubts may be raised and clouds cast by any tyro The character of every mans prop erty is therefore subject to destructive or costly libel and slander by any irresponsible examiner One may buy on the opinion of an expert and be prevented from selling by the opinion of a novice 21 The difficulties dangers and costs of examining titles grow with in creasing records 22 No certainty can be obtained with rare exceptions and absolutely none can be maintained Though all questions of title be judicially settled today others may arise under the present system with every transfer 23 Real estate is forfeited for the nonpayment of taxes This is not done with personalty and is an arbitrary distinction and discrimination against realty without foundaton in justice or necessity The State should take no more than her just due she should give good and absolute title to the property she undertakes to sell the sale should he made on the prem ises after proper advertisement and the proceeds should be dealt with as if arising from the enforcement of a deed of trust Under these circum stances a sound article being sold the property would bring its full market value and the surplus proceeds of sale after the satisfaction of taxes and other costs and charges should be paid over to the previous owner This is equity and would prevent legalized robbery of the poor and unfortunate a system to which the State is now a party but from which she derives no peculiar benefit Results of Present System First Transactions in real estate are curtailed 1 By uncertainty of title 2 By delays in transferring title 3 By costs of transfering title Second Uses of real estate are lessened Third Values of real estate are lowered Fourth Unnecessary burdens are imposed on real estate Fifth The large body of the peoplethe small ownersare the chief sufferers 448 Sept

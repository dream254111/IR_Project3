the Cape Verde and Canary Islands has prompted Hann to bring together Met Zeitschlr Dec 1906 the published observations of wind direction on the summit of the Peak of Teneriffe Lat 280 49 N Long 160 W altitude 12172 feet The conclusion is as follows the S W and W wind which is very often observed above 3000 meters even in summer is certainly not a local wind but belongs to the upper mem bers of the general atmospheric circulation The N E trade occasionally blows on the top of the peak at least in summer The mean direction of cirrus clouds in winter is W by S The N W winds observed by Hergesell in summer in the vicinity of the Canary Is lands were probably connected with the then location of the subtropical highpressure area of the North Atlantic Ocean The map of isobars at 4000 meters Teisserenc de Bort shows in July the center of the maximum somewhat N W of the Canaries so that north erly winds at 4 km above sealevel would not be contradictory to the pressure distribution According to the interesting observations of temperature and humidity made by Hergesell in the free air above the anticyclone the latter may extend to greater altitudes than has thus far been assumed More constant equatorial currents are to be expected over the West Indies and Central America in the same lati tudes CLIMATOLOGY OF THE UNITED STATES THE Climatology of the United States by Professor A J Henry Bull Q U S Weather Bureau 4to 1906 pp 1012 Pls 34 Figs 7 is one of the most important publica tions of our Weather Bureau The need of a compact summary of the essential cliinato logical data for the United States has long been felt Hitherto these tabulationis have been scattered through various annual reports of the chief of the Weather Bureau Since Loren Blodgets famous classic  The Clima tology of the United States 1857 there has been no attempt to collect into one volume and to discuss the mass of climatological ma terial collected by our official and voluntary observers The data in this volume cover generally speaking the period 18701893 There is a discussion satisfactory on the whole of the climates of the United States in general 84 pages illustrated by a consider able number of maps This is the portion of the book which will be most generally used and it will serve its purpose well A long series of tables follows in such form that they can easily be referred to by those who wish detailed information At the end occupying the larger part of the volume come condensed summaries for the different states The ad vertised price of the book is 10 which is much too high if the volume is to find its wayMARCH 1 19071 SCIENCE 355 geerally into our libraries but it is to be hoped that all educational institutions will secure free copies THE ANTITRADE OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN THE Results of the FrancoAmerican Ex pedition to explore the Atmosphere in the Tropics are discussed by Professor A L Ratch in the Proc Amer Acad Arts and Sci Vol 42 No 14 Dec 1906 A summary of these results has already appeared in ScI MNCE This expedition it will be remembered was sent out in the summer of 1905 at the joint expense of Messrs Teisserenc de Bort and Rotch and made studies of the atmos pheric conditions in and above the N E trade belt of the eastern North Atlantic by means of small balloons and kites The most im portant result of the summers work was the establishment of the fact that the classic ob servations of the return trade which were long ago made on the Peak of Teneriffe indicate a general phenomenon and agree with those obtained over the open ocean by the present expedition We note also a confirmation p 268 of the view that at sea cumulus clouds noted at the edge of the N E trade in this case are probably formed by the condensa tion of water vapor which is diffused upward from the ocean surface THE TSUKUBA OBSERVATORY We have received the results of meteoro logical observations made on Mt Tsukuba Japan during the year 1902 This moun tainl is about forty miles northeast of Tokio and rises to 2854 feet at its highest summit Although the altitude is not great the ex posure is excellent In addition to the sum mit station there are also a base and an inter mediate station The observatory is well equipped with standard instruments Obser vations are taken at 2 6 and 10 AM and PM on the summit at 0 2 4 6 8 10 AM and Pm at the intermediate station At the base observations are made weekly when the ther mograph and barograph sheets are changed On the summit liourly records can be ob tained from the selfrecording instruments An annual publication is issued On the title page appears this statement  Herausgegeben von HofmarschallAmt S K H des Prinzen Yamashina TUBERCULOSIS AMONG THE INDIANS OF ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO UNDER the above

No climate is a specific It is certainly of great benefit to those in the early stages of tuber culosis but is of little value when a patient is improperly nourished and is surrounded by filth or

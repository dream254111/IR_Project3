POWER OF MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS TO GRANT EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES The rapid development of the law due to the ever increasing number and importance of public service corporations has given rise to many inter esting questions of vital importance to both the corporations and the munici palities and has left it in many respects in an uncertain and unsettled condition Because of the fact that cases involving the question indicated in the heading often go off on constitutional grounds two very recent de cisions by the United States Supreme Court Vicksburg v Vicksburg Wla terworks Company 202 U S 453 26 Sup Ct Rep 660 decided in I9o6 and Water Light  Gas Company v City of Hutchinson 207 U S 583 28 Sup Ct Rep I35 decided Dec 23 I907 are especially worthy of note In the Vicksburg case the facts briefly stated were as follows The city of Vicksburg Miss with the usual general authority to supply itself and inhabitants with water and to enter into contracts with refer ence thereto executed a contract with the water companys assignors where by they were to furnish the city with water the city on its part contract ing that in consideration of the public benefit to be derived therefrom the 35 CENTS PER NUMBERMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW exclusive right and privilege is hereby granted for a period of thirty 30 years    of erecting maintaining and operating a system of water works etc Vicksburg Waterworks Co v Vicksburg 185 U S 65 69 Later the Mississippi legislature passed an act authorizing municipal cor porations within the state to establish municipal water plants for the pur pose of furnishing themselves and inhabitants with water for public and domestic purposes Pursuant to authority granted by this act the city council of Vicksburg enacted an ordinance for the establishment of such a plant whereupon the water company instituted suit in the United States Circuit Court to enjoin the city from proceeding further claiming that this last ordinance and the proceedings about to be taken thereunder interfered with its exclusive right and impaired the obligation of its contract with the city The circuit court allowed the injunction which order upon ap peal to the supreme court was affirmed 5 MICH LAW REV 42 In the Hutchinson case the complainant company had acquired from its assignors rights under a certain contract made with the defendant city whose authority from the state was of the same general nature as that of Vicksburg The contract in terms granted them the exclusive right and privilege for the term of twenty years from the date of the passage and approval of this ordinance No 402 of supplying the city of Hutchinson Reno county Kan and the inhabitants thereof by a system of water works with water    with electric current for electric light and power etc That the contract conferred or purported to confer an exclu sive right or privilege cannot be denied and the supreme court so consid ered it in its opinion In 1905 some years after the date of the contract referred to and after the company had expended considerable sums of money in improvements etc on the strength of its supposed exclusive right the city council by its ordinance No 65I granted to certain other parties the right to construct and operate a street railway and to construct and op erate electric and gas plants for the purposes for which electricity and gas may be used Thereupon the complainant brought suit in the United States Circuit Court to restrain the city and the grantees of the right under ordi nance No 65I from interfering with its exclusive rights basing its claim upon the same grounds that were urged in the Vicksburg case The court refused to grant the injunction for the reason that the city of Hutchinson had no authority under the charter and the laws of Kansas to grant an exclusive right or privilege such as it had purported to give complainant I44 Fed 256 5 MICH LAW REV 136 On appeal to the supreme court the decree of the lower court was affirmed It will thus be seen that in these two cases in which the decrees of the supreme court were exactly opposite the only difference in the facts out of which they arose was that in the one it was a thirtyyear exclusive fran chise to furnish water which was violated by the city attempting to estab lish a municipal water plant while in the other case the franchise was for twenty years violated by the city attempting to grant the right to furnish electricity to the city and its inhabitants to a new company Neither the difference in time nor the fact that in one case it was a water supply that 398NOTE AND COMMENT 399 was involved while in the other it was electricity seemed to influence the court in arriving at its conclusions thus leaving as the only real distin guishing feature the fact that in the Vicksburg case it was the city itself that attempted to establish a competing plant while in the Hutchinson case the city instead of putting in its own plant granted that right to third par ties At first blush the two cases seem to be almost squarely in conflict but a careful analysis of the opinions and facts upon which they were based shows possible grounds of distinction It is the purpose of this note to point out and briefly discuss those grounds together with a consideration of the prin ciples involved and the cases relative thereto with especial reference to the decision of the United States Supreme Court Municipal and public corporations are creatures of the state created pri marily for the purpose of enabling the state to more adequately administer its governmental functions and duties and as such they act as agents of the state As such agents they have no powers except those granted by the charter or the general law in express terms or by necessary implication In the case of the municipal corporation there is the additional feature that to a certain extent its creation is for the benefit of the people within its limits but that fact does not confer upon them any wider powers As between the state and the municipality any doubt as to the construction of powers granted is re solved in favor of the state the interest of the public at large being in theory considered as superior to that of any portion thereof Detroit Cit izens Street R Co v Detroit R Co 171 U S 48 43 L Ed 67 I8 Sup Ct Rep 732 While as between the municipality and an individual or pri vate corporation any doubt as to the construction of the extent of any power or right granted by the city is resolved in favor of the city the interest of a portion of the public being considered as of paramount importance to that of any individual or private corporation Rogers Park Water Co v Fergus I80 U S 624 45 L Ed 702 21 Sup Ct Rep 490 Freeport Water Co v Freeport I80 U S 598 45 L Ed 688 2I Sup Ct Rep 497 Joplin v South west Missouri Light Co I9I U S I50 48 L Ed 127 24 Sup Ct Rep 43 Owensboro v Owensboro Waterworks Co I9I U S 358 48 L Ed 217 24 Sup Ct Rep 82 In the early and leading case of Charles River Bridge v The Warren Bridge II Pet 422 the rule was stated by Mr CHIEE JUSTIcE TANEY to be that no grant by the legislature to a private corporation or individual would be considered as exclusive unless granted in the clearest express terms and that every doubt would be resolved against the individual and in favor of the public The principle of this case has since been reaffirmed in a multitude of cases So had the legislatures of Mississippi and Kansas made the contracts directly with the water companies instead of making them through their agents the cities of Vicksburg and Hutchinson such contracts would not have been construed as granting exclusive rights unless so expressed in the most unequivocal terms Still in the Vicksburg case the court held that a contract by the city granting an exclusive right was valid for otherwise the city would not have been barred from erecting its plant thus necessarily holding that the city had such authority from the stateMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW But its authority from the state was in mere general terms there being no express power given to confer exclusive rights In reaching its conclusion it is apparent that the court went squarely contrary to the settled rules of construction and held in effect that what the state could not do directly it could do indirectly through its agent It may be answered to this objection that the power to make such a con tract was given Vicksburg by necessary implication that it could not exer cise tl4e powers expressly granted except in that manner But the court did not put its decision on that ground and in the Hutchinson case it concluded that such a contract was not necessarily the only manner in which the citys express powers could be exercised The only case which it has been possible to find holding that such a contract was necessary to the execution of the powers conferred is Atlantic City Waterworks Co v Atlantic City 39 N J Eq 367 It would seem therefore that in the Vicksburg case the supreme court must have found the contract between the city and the water company to be valid as otherwise the city would not have been prevented from establish ing its own plant there being no contention that there was anything besides the contract that prevented it In the cases in which the supreme court has been called upon to consider the question it has held that a municipal or public corporation cannot grant an exclusive franchise without express authority from the state so to do Minturn v LaRue 23 How 435 Wright v Nagle IOI U S 791 In Minturn v LaRue the city of Oakland which had general authority by its charter to establish and regulate ferries granted to the complainant the exclusive right of operating a line of ferries between that city and San Francisco Later the defendant undertook to run a competing line The object of this action was to secure an injunction restraining the defendant from interfering with the complainants exclusive right The question whether under the power conferred upon the city it had authority to grant the exclusive right which it purported to have done was squarely presented In holding that the city had not such authority the court by Mr Justice NELSON said page 436 It is a well settled rule of construction of grants by the legislature to corporations whether public or private that only such powers and rights can be exercised under them as are clearly comprehended within the words of the act or derived therefrom by neces sary implication regard being had to the objects of the grant Any ambig uity or doubt arising out of the terms used by the legislature must be re solved in favor of the public This principle has been so often applied in the construction of corporate powers that we need not stop to refer to au thorities In Wright v Nagle the Inferior Court which under the statutes of Geor gia had authority to establish and regulate ferries and bridges gave to com plainants what in terms amounted to an exclusive right to maintain toll bridges within certain limits Later the commissioners of roads and revenue for the county authorized the defendant to erect and maintain a bridge with in the limits of the grant to complainants who thereupon applied for an in 400NOTE AND COMMENT junction to restrain the interference with their exclusive right The lower court and the Georgia Supreme Court held that the grant to complainants did purport to be exclusive but that the Inferior Court had not the power under the general authority conferred upon it to grant an exclusive right to erect and maintain toll bridges and so refused the injunction On appeal to the United States Supreme Court the decision was affirmed In the other federal courts and in the state courts almost without ex ception the rule seems to be to the same effect as announced in Minturn v LaRue and Wright v Nagle See Jackson County Horse R Co v Inter state Rapid Transit Co 24 Fed 306 Saginaw Gas Light Co v City of Sag inaw 28 Fed 529 Grand Rapids E L  P Co v Grand Rapids E E L  F G Co 33 Fed 659 The Westerly Waterworks Co v Town of West erly 80 Fed 6 1 Norwich GasLight Co v Norwich City Gas Co 25 Conn I9 Gale v

262 Altgeld v City of San Antonio 8I Tex 436 Syr acuse Water Co v City of Syracuse 16 N Y 167 The decision in the Vicksburg case as appears from the opinion of Mr JUSTIcE DAY was based upon the decision of the same court in Walla Walla v Walla Walla Water Co 172 U S I 19 Sup Ct Rep 77 But as pointed out in 5 MICH LAW REV 42 the facts in the two cases were not at all the same In the Walla Walla case the city had granted the water company a franchise to furnish water for public and domestic purposes the city agree ing on its part that the city of Walla Walla shall not erect maintain or become interested in any waterworks except the ones herein referred to etc Subsequently the city attempted to establish a municipal plant and an injunction restraining the city from violating its contract was granted But in that case there was involved no question of the validity of an exclusive grant the only question considered being whether the city could contract to exclude itself from competing and the decision of the court went only to the extent of holding that a contract such as the city had there made was valid The contract being valid of course the city was properly enjoined In the Vicksburg case the contract attempted to do more than merely exclude the city itself from competition it purported to create an absolutely exclusive franchisein other words a monopoly In the Hutchinson case the court in line with what is manifestly the overwhelming weight of authority in the other courts and its own decisions prior to the Vicksburg case held that such a contract was ultra vires It being ultra vires on grounds of public policy the contract was void If such a contract really is ultra vires is it not a rather startling proposition to hold that by it a municipality can bar itself from establishing a plant of its own and thus destroy the monopoly and still at the same time and under the same contract is not prevented from granting the privilege to a third party and thus indirectly accomplish the same purpose Yet that is exactly the condition in which the law is left by the decisions in the Vicksburg and Hutchinson cases There are two reasons given for holding these exclusive privilege con 401MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW tracts void first because the city has no authority from the state to enter into such contracts and second because a monopoly is thereby created and monopolies are odious However since the primary reason for holding that cities have no such authority is that a monopoly is created the creation of which is possible only by the clearest terms and since the city has only such power as is given it it is apparent that the two reasons really amount to but one and that the laws aversion to monopolies In practically every in stance in which a city has granted such an exclusive right and then at tempts to grant a new franchise to other parties or to establish a plant of its own it is self evident that the object is the betterment of conditions caused by the monopoly Nor does it require judicial expression to establish the fact that in villages and cities of comparatively small size where there are public service corporations already in operation it is next to impossible to induce private capital to enter into competition In such cases unless the municipality can install its own plant the established companies have in effect as complete and secure a monopoly as they would have were their con tracts purporting to give them their exclusive rights held valid and binding In view of the large number of exclusive franchises which our municipalities have purported to give and the ever increasing popularity and demand for municipal ownership of public service enterprises it is indeed much to be desired that the supreme court will not feel inclined to follow its decision in the Vicksburg case In the opinion of the court in the Hutchinson case in distinguishing that case from the Vicksburg case besides the difference in the facts there was given one other ground stated by the court as follows In the Vicksburg case it was pointed out that the power of the city to exclude itself from building waterworks was recognized to exist by the Supreme Court of Mis sissippi A most careful examination however of the opinion and state ment of facts in that case discloses no such conclusion or even intimation that the decision was in anywise founded on that fact The only Mississippi law or cases referred to were Collins v Sherman 31 Miss 679 Gaines v Coates 5I Miss 335 and Greenville Waterworks Co v City of Greenville 7 So 409 As clearly pointed out by Mr JUSTICE DAY those cases only went to the extent of holding that an exclusive grant would not be presumed that clear and express termsmust be used But even granting that such had been shown to be the law of Mississippi it seems that it would not have been controlling In Wright v Nagle at page 793 Mr Chief Justice WAITE said It is true the court below disposed of the case by deciding that the state statutes did not authorize the Inferior Court to grant Miller an ex clusive right to maintain bridges within the designated limits and that in so doing it gave construction to a state statute It is also true that ordi narily such a construction would be conclusive on us One exception how ever exists to this rule and that is where the state court has been called upon to interpret the contracts of states though they have been made in the forms of law or by the instrumentality of a states authorized functionaries in conformity with state legislation See also Jefferson Branch Bank v Skelley I Black 436 Louisville  Nashville Railroad v Barnes og9 U S 402NOTE AND COMMENT 403 254 257 Louisville Gas Co v Citizens Gas Co 115 U S 683 697 Douglas v Kentucky i68 U S 488 Vicksburg v Vicksburg Waterworks Co 202 U S 453 It seems then that the only possible manner of distinguishing or recon ciling the decisions in the two principal cases is on the theory that though a contract of a city granting an exclusive right for a term of years is void to the extent of not barring the city from conferring a franchise to other parties still there is left in that contract enough force and vitality to pre vent the city from establishing a plant of its own In other words the court having held in the Walla Walla case that it was competent for a city by ex press contract to bar itself from competition in cases involving such con tracts as was considered in the Vicksburg and Hutchinson cases the court will hold invalid only that part which makes the contract exclusive thus in effect severing it retaining that which when standing alone has been held valid and rejecting the remainder But suppose this kind of contract were presented to the court A franchise to a public service corporation the city contracting not to grant a similar right to others either not mentioning it at all or expressly reserving the right to establish a municipal plant Would not the court have to hold such contract valid There certainly would not be present the element of exclusiveness or monopoly the ground upon which these franchises have been held invalid And if the court would hold such contract valid what would their holding be in another case sim ilar to the Vicksburg case In adopting this doctrine of the severability of the contract the court has adopted a rule of cohstruction quite contrary to the trend of previous decisions for the tendency has been to hold that the municipality has not excluded itself In fact there is very respectable authority for the view that even by express contract a city cannot exclude itself there being no question of creating a monopoly involved ELLIOT MUNIC CORPS  148 DILLON MUNIC CORPS  97 and cases cited R W A POLICE REGULATION OF SLEEPING CAR BERTHSFrom the time of the in troduction of the sleeping car there has been a constant feud between the sleeping car companies and the travelling public in regard to the upper berths The exigencies of the situation have of course made economy of space a prime requisite in sleeping car construction and there is no doubt but that a high degree of success in this respect has attended the efforts of the sleeping car builders The public has usually been tolerant enough of the close quarters assigned to it when crowding has seemed necessary to accommodate the travellers applying for sleeping car space but it has never been quite clear to the average traveller why he should be forced to practice the arts of the contortionist at the risk of breaking his head against the up per berth when no one occupied or wanted that upper berth He has usually assumed that the companys regulation in regard to unoccupied upper berths has been designed to force him to buy an entire section if he wished headroom enough to make a lower berth comfortable

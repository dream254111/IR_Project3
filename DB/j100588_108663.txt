J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108663,ON THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADAE,I207013, 279  XVI ON THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADW BY J S BOWERBANK LLD FRS ELS C RECEIVED JUNE 17READ JUNE 18 1857 PART ION THE SPICULA HITHERTO THE SPONGIADAE HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED EITHER BY THEIR EXTERNAL FORM OR IN ACCORD ANCE WITH THEIR CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS IN THE SECOND EDITION OF LAMARCKS ANIM S VERT 138 SPECIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENUS SPONGIA WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REFERENCE TO THEIR INTERNAL STRUCTURE AND THEY ARE DIVIDED INTO SEVEN GROUPS BY EXTERNAL FORM ONLY THE SAME CHARACTERS SERVING ALSO IN A GREAT DEGREE TO DISCRIMINATE THE SPECIES FLEMING GRANT JOHNSTON AND OTHER MODERN NATURALISTS HAVE MADE THEIR PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS DEPEND ON THEIR CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS AND HAVE THEREFORE CONSTRUCTED THREE GREAT DIVISIONS AS GENERASPONGIA COMPOSED OF KERATOSE FIBRES UNMIXED AS IT WAS SUP POSED WITH EARTHY MATTER IALICHONDRIA FORMED PRINCIPALLY OF SILICEOUS SPICULA AND GRANTIA HAVING THE SKELETON COMPOSED OF CALCAREOUS SPICULA INCLUDED IN THE SECOND OF THESE DIVISIONS ARE THE GENERA TETHEA GEODIA PACHYMATISMA SPONGILLA DYSIDEA AND IALISARCA AND THESE NINE GENERA ARE ALL THAT ARE CONTAINED IN DR JOHNSTONS  HISTORY OF BRITISH SPONGES BOTH OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE VERY INSUFFICIENT AND THAT OF LAMARCK COMPLETELY INEFFECTUAL INASMUCH AS THERE IS NO CLASS OF ANIMALS IN WHICH THE FORM VARIES TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENCE OF LOCALITY OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALSO EVEN WHEN THERE IS A STRIKING NORMAL FORM IT IS RARELY THOROUGHLY DEVELOPED UNTIL THE ANIMAL HAS REACHED ITS FULL MATURITY ACCORDING TO THE PRACTICE OF LAMARCK EVEN UNDER THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE FREQUENTLY RECURRING DIFFICULTIES IN THE DETERMI NATION OF THE SPECIES BY THIS METHOD AS THE SAME FORMS ARE FOUND TO BE COMMON TO A GREAT NUMBER OF SPONGES THE INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF WHICH ARE WIDELY DIFFERENT TO EACH OTHER FROM THESE CAUSES IT IS THAT NO NATURALISTS WITH WHOM I HAVE CONFERRED ON THIS SUBJECT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY THE SPECIES OF A SPONGE BY THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY LAMARCI IN HIS  ANIM S VERT OR BY THOSE OF ANY OTHER AUTHOR WHO HAS ADOPTED THE SAME METHOD OF DESCRIPTION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PERHAPS A FEW VERY STRIKING SPECIES THE DIVISION OF THE SPONGIADAE BY THEIR CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS MAY SERVE VERY WELL TO SEPARATE THEM INTO PRIMARY GROUPS BUT THEY ARE FAR TOO LIMITED TO BE APPLIED AS GENERIC CHARACTERS I HAVE THEREFORE FOR THIS PURPOSE REJECTED BOTH SYSTEMS AND HAVE RETAINED THE LATTER ONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING PRIMARY DIVISIONS ONLY AND I PURPOSE FOUNDING THE GENERIC CHARACTERS PRINCIPALLY ON THE ORGANIC STRUCTURE AND MODE OF ARRANGEMENT OF MDCCCLVIII 2 Q280 DR J S BOWERBANK ON THE ANATOMY THE SKELETON SPONGILLA DIFFERS IN NO RESPECT FROM ILALICHONDRIA AS NOW ACCEPTED BY NATURALISTS AND THE LATTER EVEN IN THE NARROW CIRCLE OF THE LIST OF BRITISH SPECIES CON TAINS AT LEAST TEN DISTINCT MODES OF ARRANGEMENT OF THE SKELETON EACH OF WHICH IS CON STANT AND WELLDEFINED IN ITS CHARACTER IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO PROPOSE THE REJECTION OF ANY OF THE WELLESTABLISHED GENERA OF MY PREDECESSORS  BUT TO CONFINE EACH GENUS STRICTLY WITHIN THE BOUNDS INDICATED BY THE PECULIAR MODE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON WHICH EXISTS IN THAT SPECIES OF SPONGE WHICH IS THE OLDESTESTABLISHED AND BESTKNOWN TYPE OF THE GENUS AND TO REFER ALL OTHERS THAT MAY DISTINCTLY DIFFER FROM THAT TYPE TO NEW GENERA FOUNDED ON STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES WHEN I COMMENCED IN A SIMILAR MANNER A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE SPECIFIC CHARAC TERS OF PRECEDING AUTHORS AND ENDEAVOURED TO COLLECT AND CLASSIFY THEM I FOUND THEM TO BE STILL MORE INDETERMINATE THAN THOSE OF CLASS OR GENERA IN TRUTH IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS SCARCELY AN APPROACH TO A DISTINCT TERMINOLOGY TO THE SCIENCE AND THAT THE SAME AUTHOR FREQUENTLY DESIGNATED THE SAME ORGAN UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES BY A TOTALLY DIFFERENT NAME I THEREFORE FELT IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE DESCRIP TION OF NEW SPECIES TO ENTER INTO A THOROUGH SYSTEMATIC EXAMINATION OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE WHOLE OF THE SPECIES WITHIN MY REACH AND TO CHARACTERIZE THE ORGANS IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO RENDER THE TERMS I APPLIED TO THEM DEFINITE IN THEIR MEANING AND LIMITED IN THEIR APPLICATION AND IN PURSUING THIS OBJECT I QUICKLY FOUND AN ABUNDANCE OF CON STANT AND WELLCHARACTERIZED FORMS AND COMBINATIONS OF ORGANIZATION CAPABLE OF BEING APPLIED WITH PRECISION TO THE PURPOSES OF GENERIC AND SPECIFIC DESCRIPTIONS I PROPOSE THEREFORE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO CHARACTERIZE THE ELEMENTARY TISSUES IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER 1 SPICULA 2 KERATODE OR HORNY SUBSTANCE A MEMBRANOUS TISSUES 4 FIBROUS TISSUES 5 CELLULAR TISSUES 6 SARCODE AND IN THE SECOND PLACE TO TREAT OF THE ORGANIZATION AND PHYSIOLOGY IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER 1 THE SKELETON 2 THE SARCODOUS SYSTEM 3 THE INTERSTITIAL CANALS 4 INTERMARGINAL CAVITIES 5 DERMAL MEMBRANE 6 THE PORES 7 THE OSCULA 8 INHALATION AND EXHALATION  FTETHEA GEODIA DYSIDEA AND A FEW OTHERS ARE THE ONLY WELLDEFINED GENERA THAT HAVE

CHARACTERS AND ON THE METHOD OF EXAMINATION IN MY REFERENCES TO THE VIEWS OF PRECEDING WRITERS REGARDING THE ANATOMY AND PHY SIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADVE I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO CORRECT THE ERRORS RATHER THAN TO POINT OUT THE AUTHORS OF THEM FEELING SATISFIED THAT POSTERITY WILL CARE AS LITTLE ABOUT THE PETTY ANGRY DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING THE FACTS AND OPINIONS OF THE PRESENT PERIOD AS WE DO ABOUT THOSE OF OUR ANCESTORS AT THE SAME TIME I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO DO JUSTICE TO THE INDUSTRY AND RESEARCH OF PRECEDING NATURALISTS WHOSE ERRORS OF OMISSION ARE ENTITLED TO EVERY POSSIBLE EXCUSE WHEN WE REMEMBER THE DIFFICULTIES THEY LABOURED UNDER IN THE COURSE OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS FOR WANT OF COMPETENT MICROSCOPIC POWERS WITH WHICH TO WORK OUT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE MINUTE AND DELICATE OBJECTS OF THEIR RESEARCH WHILE WE ARE IN FULL POSSESSION OF ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF THE MODERN IMPROVEMENTS OF THE MICROSCOPES GIVING A PLEASURE AND FACILITY TO OUR INVESTIGATIONS THAT MUST HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY ALMOST UNKNOWN TO OUR PREDECESSORS THE SPICULA THE SPICULA ARE ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT IN CHARACTER FROM THE FIBRES OF THE SPONGE ALTHOUGH THE LATTER MAY BE EQUALLY SILICEOUS WITH THE FORMER HOWEVER CLOSELY THE SPICULA MAY BE BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH SILICEOUS FIBRE THEY DO NOT APPEAR TO UNITE OR ANASTOMOSE WHILE THE FIBRE WHETHER SILICEOUS OR KERATOSE ALWAYS ANASTOMOSE WHEN IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH OTHER PARTS OF ITS OWN BODY OR OF THOSE OF ITS OWN SPECIES THEY DIFFER EXCEEDINGLY IN DIMENSIONS THE LONGEST I HAVE SEEN ARE THE PREHENSILE ONES AT THE BASE OF EUPLECTELLA CUCUMER OWEN WHICH EXCEED 3 INCHES IN LENGTH THEY ARE AMONG THE EARLIEST ORGANS THAT ARE PRODUCED IN THE YOUNG SPONGE DR GRANT IN HIS VALUABLE PAPERS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPONGIADO STATES THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CILIATED GEMMULE OF THE SPONGE HE HAS DESCRIBED AS HALICHONDRIA PANICEA HAS ATTACHED ITSELF TO A ROCK OR STONE IT SPREADS OUT INTO A THIN GELATINOUSLOOKING SPOT AND VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THERE APPEARS A FEW SPICULA IRREGULARLY DISPOSED IN ABOUT THE CENTRE OF THE MASST IN THE YOUNG GEMMULES OF TETHEA CRANIUM WHILE IN A VERY IMMATURE CONDITION THEY ARE PROJECTED FOR HALF THEIR LENGTH BEYOND THE SURFACE OF THE SMALL NUCLEUS OF ANIMAL MATTER THAT EXISTS AT THE EARLY STAGE OF ITS DEVELOPMENT WHILE IN THE MATURE GEMMULE NOT A VESTIGE OF THEM IS APPAREVT BEYOND ITS SURFACE IN THE EARLY STAGE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT THE SPICULA APPEAR TO CONSIST OF A DOUBLE  IRALICHONDRIA INCRUDSTAN JOHNTSTONS BRITISH SPONGES T EDINBURGH PHIL JOURN VOL XIII P 3813 2 Q 2282 DR J S BOWERBANK ON THE ANATOMY MEMBRANE BETWEEN WHICH THE FIRST LAYER OF SILEX IS SECRETED AND IN THIS CONDITION THEY PRESENT AN INTERNAL CAVITY APPROACHING VERY NEARLY TO THE SIZE OF THEIR EXTERNAL DIAMETER IN THIS STATE THEY READILY BEND ABRUPTLY IN ANY DIRECTION WITHOUT BREAKING AS MAY BE SEEN IN PLATE XXIII FIG 1 WHICH REPRESENTS A PORRECTOTERNATE SPICULUM FROM THE TERMI NATION OF ONE OF THE RADIAL LINES OF THE SKELETON AT THE SURFACE OF TETEEA CRANIURM THIS SPICULUM HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY DISTORTED BY PRESSURE ON THE POINTS OF THE RAYS AT ITS APEX THE DEPOSIT OF THE SILEX IS NOT CONTINUOUS AND HOMOGENEOUS BUT IS PRODUCED IN SUCCESSIVE CONCENTRIC LAYERS WHICH IT WOULD APPEAR ARE AT LEAST FOR A PERIOD EQUALLY SECRETED BY THE INNER SURFACE OF THE OUTER MEMBRANE AND THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE INNER ONE FOR WE ALWAYS FIND THAT AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPICULUM PROGRESSES THE INTERNAL CAVITY GRADUALLY BECOMES LESS UNTIL FINALLY IT EXISTS ONLY AS A CENTRAL CANAL OF VERY MINUTE DIAMETER IN COMPARISON WITH THAT OF THE SPICULUM ITSELF THESE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT MAY OFTEN BE SEEN IN THE SPICULA OF YOUNG SPECIMENS OF SPONGILLA FJLVIATILIS ESPECIALLY IN THE SPRING WHEN THEY AXE GROWING RAPIDLY IF SMALL FRAGMENTS OF THE SPONGE BE SLIGHTLY CHARRED IN THE FLAME OF A LAMP AND THEN SUBMITTED TO MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINA TION THE OUTER AND INNER MEMBRANES OF THE SPICULA WILL READILY BE RENDERED VISIBLE PLATE XXIII FIGS 2 AND 3 IN IMMATURE SPICULA THE INTERNAL MEMBRANE IS REPRESENTED BY A DENSE BLACK FILM OF CHARCOAL AS IN PLATE XXIII FIG 3 WHILE IN THE MATURE ONES THE SMALL CENTRAL CAVITY IS SEEN TO BE LINED BY SO THIN A MEMBRANE AS TO AFFORD BY ITS CHARRING A SLIGHT BROWN TINGE ONLY TO ITS WALLS PLATE XXIII FIG 2 THE CONCENTRIC DEPOSITION OF THE LAYERS OF SILEX OR CARBONATE OF LIME IN THE SPICULA ARE ALSO READILY TO BE SEEN PLATE XXIII FIG 4 IN TRANSVERSE FRACTURES OF ALMOST ANY LARGE SPICULUM EITHER SILICEOUS OR CALCAREOUS AND THEY PRESENT THE SAME ASPECT AS SIMILAR SECTIONS OF EITHER THE PRISMATIC CELLS OF SHELL TISSUE OR THE SPICULA OF A GORGONIA THE AMOUNT OF SILEX AND THE MANNER OF ITS DEPOSITION IN THE SPICULA IS NOT THE SAME UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE SPICULUM IS SIMPLY REQUIRED TO GIVE STRENGTH AND FIRMNESS TO THE SKELETON AS IN THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE HALICHONDRACEOUS SPONGES THE WHOLE INTERIOR OF THE SPICULUM BECOMES RAPIDLY FILLED WITH SILEX BUT WHERE STRENGTH IS REQUIRED TO BE COMBINED WITH GREAT ELASTICITY AND TOUGHNESS THE MODE OF DEPOSIT IS ESPECIALLY ADAPTED TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE OCCASION THE AMOUNT OF THE SILEX DEPO SITED IS SMALL AND CONFINED WHOLLY TO THE SURFACE WHILE THE INTERIOR APPEARS TO BE FILLED WITH KERATODE THESE LAWS OF DEPOSIT WILL PERHAPS BE BEST ILLUSTRATED BY MY DETAILING A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS I MADE BY THE INCINERATION OF THE SPICULA OF VARIOUS SPONGES IN THE FLAME OF A SMALL SPIRITLAMP I WAS LED TO THIS SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS BY FREQUENTLY OBSERVING DURING THE COURSE OF MY INVESTIGATIONS THE GREAT AMOUNT OF FEXURE THAT MANY OF THE LARGE AND LONG SPICULA WOULD SUSTAIN WITHOUT FRACTURE AND THE PERFECT ELASTICITY WITH WHICH THEY REGAINED THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND POSITION THUS IN MOUNTING THE SPICULA OF TETHEA CRANIUM IN CANADA BALSAM THE LONG AND SLENDER PORRECTOTERNATE DEFENSIVE SPICULA PROJECTED FROM ITS SURFACE WOULD FREQUENTLY HAVE THE SHAFT BENT INTO A SERIES OF SIGMOID CURVES OR EVEN LOOPS AND THE THICKEST PORTION OF THE SAME SPICULA WHILE IN THEIR NATURAL CONDITION MAY BE BENT DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF THE SPONGE FROMAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADA 283 WHICH THEY SPRING AT RIGHT ANGLES SO AS TO FORM AN ARC OF THE THIRD OF A CIRCLE WITH PER FECT IMPUNITY THIS GREAT FLEXIBILITY APPEARED TO ME TO BE SO INCOMPATIBLE WITH A PURELY SILICEOUS STRUCTURE THAT I DETERMINED TO SELECT THE SPICULA OF TETHEA CRANUM MORE ESPECIALLY TO WORK OUT THIS PROBLEM AND FROM THE LARGE SIZE OF THOSE OF THE SKELETON FASCICULI THEY ARE MORE THAN USUALLY FAVOURABLE FOR THE PURPOSE IF WE VIEW THESE SPICULA IN THEIR NATURAL CONDITION MOUNTED IN EITHER WATER OR CANADA BALSAM BY TRANSMITTED LIGHT AND A LINEAR POWER OF 150 THEY PRESENT ALL THE USUAL APPEARANCES OF SOLID SILICEOUS SPICULA THERE IS A SMALL CENTRAL TUBULAR CAVITY AND THE SUBSTANCE OF THE SPICULA INTER VENING BETWEEN IT AND THE EXTERNAL SURFACE PRESENTS TO THE EYE THE LINEAR APPEARANCE THAT CHARACTERIZES A DEPOSIT IN CONCENTRIC CIRCLES AND THE FRACTURED ENDS HAVE PRECISELY THE SAME ASPECT THAT FILAMENTS OF THE SAME SIZE OF HARD DRY GLUE OR GLASS WOULD PRESENT TO THE EYE IF THESE SPICULA BE NOW BURNED IN THE FLAME OF A SMALL SPIRITLAMP UNTIL THE COMBUSTION IS COMPLETED AND THE MASS IS BROUGHT TO A WHITE HEAT AND IT BE THEN EXAMINED AS BEFORE THE RESULTS ARE WIDELY DIFFERENT IN THEIR ASPECT THE SPICULA HAVE BECOME CONSIDERABLY INCREASED IN DIAMETER AND INSTEAD OF BEING SOLID THEY ARE NOW EXTREMELY THIN TUBES OF SILEX LINED WITH A DENSE AND NEARLY OPAKE FILM OF CHARCOAL ROUGH AND GRANULATED IN ITS APPEARANCE I THOUGHT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THAT I MIGHT HAVE UNWITTINGLY SELECTED A FASCICULUS OF YOUNG SPICULA ONLY FOR BURNING AND I THEREFORE REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT BURNING ONLY HALF OF THE FASCICULUS AND PRESERVING THE REMAINDER IN AN UNALTERED CONDITION AND ON CAREFULLY MOUNTING THE SPECIMEN IN CANADA BALSAM I FOUND THE SAME RESULTS PRECISELY THE UNBURNED HALF OF THE FASCICULUS PRESENTED ALL THE CHARACTERS OF SOLIDITY THAT I HAVE BEFORE DESCRIBED WHILE THE BURNED HALF WAS IN PERFECT UNISON WITH THE PREVIOUS RESULTS OF INCINERATION AND AT THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO THE TRANSITION FROM THE ONE STATE TO THE OTHER MIGHT BE READILY TRACED EVEN IN SINGLE SPICULA THE EXTERNAL COAT OF SILEX IN THESE SPICULA IS SO THIN AND THE COAT OF CHARCOAL WITH WHICH IT IS LINED SO ROUGH AND OPAKE THAT THE THICKNESS OF THE SILEX CANNOT BE READILY ASCERTAINED BUT IN ONE OF THE SHORT STOUT FUSIFORMIACERATE SPICULA OF THE DERMAL COAT OF THE SPONGE WHICH IS ABOUT THE SAME DIAMETER AS THAT OF THE SKELETON SPICULA I SUCCEEDED IN MEASURING THE THICKNESS OF THE SILICEOUS COAT ACCURATELY AFTER INCINERATION THE LENGTH OF THE SPICULUM WAS 3LTH OF AN INCH THE GREATEST DIAMETER ITH OF AN INCH AND THE THICKNESS OF EXTERNAL SILICEOUS CASE 71AUTH OF ANINCH PLATE XXIII FIGS 5 AND 6 REPRESENT PORTIONS OF TWO OF THE LARGE SPICULA OF THE SKELETON AFTER INCINERATION I HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE COMBUSTIBLE MATTER IN THE INTERIOR OF THESE LARGE SPICULA IS REALLY KERATODE ONE OF THE MOST ELASTIC AND DURABLE ANIMAL SUBSTANCES WITH WHICH WE ARE ACQUAINTED THE MODE OF ITS DEPOSITION WITHIN THESE ORGANS IS PRECISELY THE SAME WITH THAT PRESENTED IN ALL THE VARIETIES OF KERATOSE FIBRE WITH WHICH I AM ACQUAINTED AND FROM ITS CONCENTRIC ARRANGEMENT THE NATURE OF THE MATERIAL ITSELF AND ITS COMBINATION WITH A THIN EXTERNAL CASE OF SILEX IT PRESENTS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST ADMIRABLE NATURAL COMBINATIONS OF STRENGTH ELASTICITY AND DURABILITY THE STRUCTURE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AS PREVAILING IN TETHEA CRANITTUB IS NOT PECULIAR TO THAT GENUS I OBTAINED VERY SINIILAR RESULTS FROM THE INCINERATION OF THE SPICULA OF284 DR J S BOWERBANK ON THE ANATOMY GEODIA MIANDREWII BOWERBANI MS A NEW AND REMARKABLY INTERESTING SPECIES IN THIS SPONGE THERE APPEARED TO BE A GREATER AMOUNT OF SILEX SECRETED IN THE LARGE SKELETON SPICULA THAN IN TETHEA WHILE SOME OF THEM AFTER INCINERATION WERE RESOLVED INTO THIN SHELLS OF SILEX OTHERS WITHSTOOD THE OPERATION AND RETAINED THEIR FORM AND SOME WERE SO COMPLETELY SILICEOUS THAT ON PLUNGING THEM INTO THE DROP OF WATER FOR EXAMINATION WHILE REDHOT FROM THE FLAME OF THE LAMP THE RESULT WAS THE SAME AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SOLID GLASS RODS AND THESE WERE CRACKED AND SHATTERED IN EVERY DIRECTION PLATE XXIII FIG 8 I SUBMITTED TO THE SAME MODE OF INCINERATION A FEW OF THE LONG SILICEOUS SPICULA OR FIBRES OF EUTLECTELLA ASPERGILLUM OWEN BURNING ABOUT HALF OF EACH FIBRE AND THE RESULT ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT WAS EQUALLY SATISFACTORY THE UNBURNED PORTION APPEARED PERFECTLY SOLID BUT EXHIBITED THE USUAL TRACE OF CONCENTRIC STRUCTURE THE END THOROUGHLY BURNED BECAME REDUCED TO A THIN FILAMENT OF DENSELY BLACK MATTER LIKE CHARCOAL BUT THE JUNCTION OF THE BURNED AND UNBURNED PORTIONS WAS EXTREMELY INTERESTING AT THIS POINT THE ACTION OF THE HEAT UPON THE CONCENTRIC LAYERS HAD SEPARATED THEM FROM EACH OTHER IN THE FORM OF A SERIES OF THIN CURVED FLAKES OR COATS ILLUSTRATING THE THIN CONCENTRIC STRUCTURE IN A VERY SATISFACTORY MANNER DEMONSTRATING THAT THE OUTER COAT OF SILICEOUS MATTER WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE AND THAT PROBABLY THERE WERE SEVERAL COATS EACH CONTAINING A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF SILEX IN ITS COMPOSITION TO RESIST DISINTEGRATION BY INCI NERATION PLATE XXIII FIG 7 ON OPERATING IN LIKE MANNER ON THE SPICULA OF HALICKLONDRIA OCULATA JOHNSTON LITTLE OR NO ALTERATION WAS PERCEPTIBLE IN THE SPICULA THE INNER CAVITY REMAINING THE SAME AS IN THE UNBURNED ONES AND DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY A SLIGHT BROWN TINT INDICATING THE EXISTENCE OF BUT A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF ANIMAL MATTER WITHIN THIS RESULT MIGHT BE EXPECTED THE SPICULA BEING IMBEDDED IN THE KERATOSE FIBRE TO GIVE IT ADDITIONAL FIRM 1ESS AND STRENGTH ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE ELASTIC THEY ARE THEREFORE SHORT COMPARATIVELY STOUT AND SOLID IN THEIR STRUCTURE A SPECIMEN OF HALICHTONDRIA PANICEA JOHNSTON BURNED IN THE FLAME OF A SPIRITLAMIP TO A WHITE HEAT EXHIBITED NO ALTERATION IN THE MATURE SPICULA IN MANY OF WHICH I COULD NOT DETECT A CENTRAL TUBULAR CAVITY AND I PRESUME IN THESE CASES THE SPICULA WERE ENTIRELY FILLED WITH SILEX AS IN YOUNGER SPICULA IT WAS MORE OR LESS APPARENT WHEN THE CAVITY WAS VERY SMALL THE COLOUR HAD A VERY FAINT TINGE OF BROWN AND AS IN OTHER CASES WHEN THE CAVITY INCREASED IN DIAMETER THE AMOUNT OF COLOURING MATTER PRODUCED BY THE INCINERATION OF THE ANIMAL MATTER WITHIN BECAME GREATER AND DEEPER IN ITS TINT UNTIL IN THE YOUNG AND IMMATURE SPICULA THE INTERNAL CAVITY OCCUPIED THE GREATER PART OF ITS DIA METER AND IT BECAME PERFECTLY BLACK AND OPAKE AND IN ONE SPICULUM THE GASEOUS MATTER GENERATED WITHIN EXPANDED ONE PART OF THE SPICULUM TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO CAUSE IT TO RESEMBLE EXACTLY A HYDROMETER IN FORM THE RESULT OF THE INCINERATION OF IALITIONDRIA INCRUSTANS JOHNSTON WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF HAL PANICEA THE ADULT SPICULA REMAINED UNALTERED AND THE CENTRAL CANAL WAS RENDERED MORE APPARENT THAN IT WAS BEFORE ON BURNING PORTIONS OF CSYONGLLA LUVATILIS AND LACUSTS JOHNSTON AND OF S7PONGLLAAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADIE 285 CEREBELLATA BOWERBANK MS I FOUND THE RESULTS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE OBTAINED FROM HALICELONDRIA PANACEA AND INCRUSTANS AS REGARDS THE SPICULA OF THE SKELETON BUT IN THE SMALL SPINOUS SPICULA INVESTING THE GEMMULES OF THE LASTNAMED SPECIES THERE WAS NO APPARENT ALTERATION NOR COULD ANY INDICATION OF A CENTRAL CAVITY BE SEEN THE CALCAREOUS SPICULA OF GRANTIA COMPRESSA WITHSTOOD INCINERATION BETTER THAN I EXPECTED THE SURFACE WAS STUDDED WITH NUMEROUS LITTLE VESICLES GENERATED BY THE HEAT AND WHICH INTERFERED WITH THEIR TRANSPARENCY BUT THEY RETAINED NEARLY THEIR ORIGINAL COLOUR AND PROPORTIONS AND IT MAY THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT THEY CONTAINED SO GREAT A PROPORTION OF CALCAREOUS MATTER AS TO PREVENT THEIR DISINTEGRATION BY HEAT MANY OF THE FORMS OF THE SPICULA ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIAR TO THE SPONGIADO BUT ON THE CONTRARY AS I SHALL HEREAFTER SHOW THEIR TYPES ARE FREQUENTLY TO BE FOUND IN THE MORE HIGHLY ORGANIZED CLASSES OF ANIMALS AND ESPECIALLY AMONG THE ZOOPHYTA THE TUNI CATA AND THE NUDIBRANCHIATE MOLLUSCA THEY ARE ALWAYS OF AN ORGANIC TYPE NEVER CRYSTALLINE OR ANGULAR EACH OF THE ELONGATED FORMS OF SPICULA MAY BE SAID TO BE COMPOSED OF THREE PARTS THE BASE THE APEX AND THE SHAFT INTERVENING BETWEEN THE TWO AND GENERALLY SPEAKING THESE PARTS MAY BE READILY DETERMINED EVEN WHEN THE SPICULA ARE ISOLATED EACH SPECIES OF SPONGE HAS NOT ONE FORM OF SPICULUM ONLY EQUALLY DISPERSED THROUGH OUT ITS WHOLE SUBSTANCE BUT ON THE CONTRARY WE FIND THAT SEPARATE PARTS HAVE EACH ITS APPROPRIATE FORM AND THUS WE FIND THAT THREE FOUR OR EVEN MORE FORMS OFTEN OCCUR IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL AND IN TETHEA CRANIUM THERE ARE NO LESS THAN SEVEN DISTINCT SHAPES BUT THESE DIFFERENCES IN STRUCTURE MUST NOT LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT EVERY STRANGE FORM OF SPICULUM THAT MEETS THE EYE IS A NORMAL ONE REMARKABLE VARIATIONS ARE OFTEN PRODUCED FOR ESPECIAL PURPOSES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SKELETON OR FOR OTHER OBJECTS AND IN SOME SPECIES SPONGILLA LACUSTRIS FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF ODD MALFORMATIONS THAT ARE OCCASIONALLY FOUND IS VERY REMARKABLE THE SIZE ALSO OF THE NORMAL FORMS OF SPICULA WILL OFTEN VARY TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT IN THE SAME SPONGE BUT IF ADULT THEY ARE ALWAYS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TYPE FORM AND IF NOT ADULT INTERMEDIATE STATES OF GROWTH ARE GENE RALLY PRESENT TO ASSIST US TO FORM CORRECT CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THEM THE FORMS THUS APPROPRIATED TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SPONGE ARE NOT ALWAYS PECULIAR TO CERTAIN SPE CIES BUT ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE FREQUENTLY FOUND TO BE REPEATED IN OTHER SPECIES DIFFERING WIDELY IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION THE SPICULA THUS APPROPRIATE TO PARTICULAR PARTS OF THE SPONGE ARE UNIFORM IN THEIR GENERAL CHARACTERS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF THE SPONGIADE AND A GREAT PORTION OF THEM ARE SO WELL CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR FORM AS TO ENABLE THE STUDENT WHEN ONCE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR PECULIARITIES TO ASSIGN EACH READILY TO ITS PROPER PLACE IN THE SPONGE I PURPOSE THEREFORE IN DESCRIBING THEM TO TREAT OF THESE ORGANS IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER 1 SPICULA OF THE SKELETON 2 CONNECTING SPICULA 3 DEFENSIVE SPICULA 4

TRIRADIATE SPICULA ARE FOUND IN ABUNDANCE ALL THE ELONGATE FORMS OF SPICULA OF THE SKELETON ARE SUBJECT TO EXTREME VARIETY IN LENGTH IN SOME SPECIES THEY MAINTAIN A GREAT DEGREE OF UNIFORMITY WHILE IN OTHERS THEY VARY TO A VERY CONSIDERABLE EXTENT ACCORDING TO THE NECESSITIES ARISING FROM THE MODE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SKELETON THE COMMONEST FORM OF SKELETON SPICULUM IS PERHAPS THE ACERATEOF

MR THOMAS INGALL FOR A PORTION OF THE SPONGE CONNECTING SPICULA THE CONNECTING SPICULA ARE NOT NECESSARILY A PART OF THE SKELETON THEY ARE A SUBSIDIARY PORTION OF IT OCCURRING UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN A FEW GENERA ONLY SUCH AS GEODIA PACHYMATISMA AND OTHER SPONGES WHICH HAVE A THICK CRUSTATED SURFACE WHICH THEY SERVE TO SUPPORT AND RETAIN IN DUE CONNEXION WITH THE MASS OF THE ANIMAL BENEATH THE TRIRADIATE APICES ALSO SERVE TO CONSTRUCT AREAS IN WHICH ARE SITUATED THE PROXIMAL ORIFICES OF THE INTERMARGINAL CAVITIES WHICH ARE IMBEDDED IN THE CRUSTATED SURFACE OF THE SPONGE THE NORMAL FORM OF THESE SPICULA IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE SPICULA WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GENERAL MASS OF THE SKELETON AND THEY ARE FAR MORE COMPLEX AND VARIED IN THEIR STRUCTURE THEY USUALLY HAVE A LONG STOUT CYLINDRICAL OR ATTENUATED SHAFT TERMINATING EITHER ACUTELY OR HEMISPHERICALLY AT THE BASE WHILE THE APEX IS DIVIDED INTO THREE STOUT EQUIANGULAR RADII WHICH ASSUME IN DIFFERENT SPECIES A CONSIDER ABLE AMOUNT OF VARIETY AS REGARDS FORM AND DIRECTION THE TRIRADIATE APICES ARE USUALLY CEMENTED FIRMLY TO THE INNER SURFACE OF THE CRUSTATED COAT OF THE SPONGE WHILE THE STOUT AND ELONGATED SHAFT IS INTERMINGLED WITH AND FIRMLY CEMENTED BY KERATODE TO THE GENERAL MASS OF THE SKELETON FROM THE TRIFID NATURE OF THE APEX I HAVE DESIGNATED THE SEFORMS AS TERNATE SPICULA PREFIXING SUCH TERMS AS MAY BEST SERVE TO DISTINGUISH THEM INDIVIDUALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PERMANENT VARIATIONS FROM EACH OTHER THE PREFIXED DESIGNA TIONS OF THE SPICULA MUST NECESSARILY IN SOME MEASURE BE ARBITRARY AS THE DIFFERENCES ILL THE DEGREE OF THE EXPANSION OF THE RADII CANNOT BE STRICTLY DEFINED AND ALTHOUGH THE FORMS ARE WELL CHARACTERIZED IN EACH SPECIES YET EVEN WITHIN THESE BOUNDS A SLIGHT DEGREE OF VARIATION ARISING FROM THE LOCAL NECESSITIES OF THE CASE WILL OCCUR THE TER NATE SPICULUM THEREFORE AS A GENERAL DESIGNATION MAY BE SAID TO BE AN ELONGATE SPICU LUM WITH A TRIPLE APICAL TERMINATION THESE SPICULA ARE NOT CONFINED TO THE OFFICE OF CON NECTING ONLY BUT ARE ALSO FOUND AMONG THE DEFENSIVE ONES AS WILL BE HEREAFTER SHOWN PORRECTOTERNATEHAVING THE TERMINAL RADII

SECONDARY BIFURCATIONS ARE NOT ALL OF THEM IN THE SAME PLANE AS THE PRIMARY ONES A PORTION OF THEM BEING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO IT AND THE SHAFT IS ALSO CARRIED THROUGH THE COMMON CENTRAL BASE OF THE WHOLE GIVING IT A SPICULATED FORM AS REPRESENTED IN THE FIGURE THIS PROLONGATION OF THE SHAFT THROUGH THE COMMON BASE OF THE RADII OF THE TERNATE SPICULA IS NOT CONFINED TO THE ONE DESCRIBED ABOVE BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A NORMAL FORM I HAVE NEVER SEEN A QUATERNATE SPICULUM ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONNECTING SPICULA IN WHICH ALL THE RADII WERE EQUIDIVERGENT IN ALL SUCH CASES THREE APPEAR TO REPRESENT THE TERNATE TYPE OF SPICULUM AND THE FOURTH OR SUPPLEMENTAL ONE IS A CONTINUATION OF THE AXIAL LINE OF THE SHAFT WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE UNITED BASES OF THE TERNATE PORTION OF THE SPICULUM I HAVE THEREFORE DESIGNATED THESE FORMS AS SPICULATED TERNATE RATHER THAN QUATERNATE THESE SPICULA ARE RATHER ANOMALOUS IN THEIR CHARACTER THEY FREQUENTLY BUT NOT UNIVERSALLY ACCOMPANY THE TRUE CONNECTING SPICULA THE TERNATE APICES DO NOT USUALLY REACH THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CRUSTATED COAT IN GEODIA BARRETTI AND SOME OTHER SPECIES IN WHICH THEY OCCUR BUT OCCASIONALLY THEY PARTIALLY FULFIL THE OFFICE OF CON NECTING SPICULA THERE IS A CONSTANT AND STRIKING DIFFERENCE IN THE PROPORTIONS OF THEAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIAD2E 291 TRUE AND THE PSEUDOCONNECTING SPICULA IF WE MAY SO TERM THEM

AS A MEANS OF ATTACHMENT TO OTHER BODIESI KNOW OF BUT ONE FORM OF THIS DESCRIPTION OF SPICULUM AN EXCEEDINGLY ELONGATED FUSIFORMI ACERATE ONE WITH A STOUT RECURVOQUATERNATE APEX IT OCCURS AT THE BASE OF EUPLECTELLA ASPERGILLUM AND E CUCUMER OWEN THE LONG ATTENUATED BASAL PORTIONS OF THE SHAFT BEING WITHOUT SPINES ARE INCORPORATED WITH THE LONGITUDINAL FASCICULI OF THE SKELETON WHILE THE APICAL PORTIONS OF THEM ARE PROJECTED FROM THE BASE OF THE SPONGE AND EMBRACE AND HOOK ON TO ANY EXTRANEOUS MASS NEAR WHICH IT MAY BE SITUATED AND THIS FREE PORTION IS THICKLY BESET WITH STRONG ACUTELY CONICAL SPINES REFLECTED AT ABOUT THE SAME ANGLE AND IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE RADII OF THE QUATERNATE APEX AND TO WHICH THEY ARE AUXILIARY AS PREHENSILE ORGANS AND AS WE PROCEED FROM THE APEX TOWARDS THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE SPICULUM THE SPINES SUCCESSIVELY DECREASE IN LENGTH UNTIL AT ABOUT ONETHIRD OF THE LENGTH OF THE SPICULUM FROM ITS APEX THEY BECOME OBSOLETE I AM INDEBTED TO MY FRIEND DR ARTHUR FARRE FOR THE SPECIMEN FIGURED OF THIS SINGULAR AND INTERESTING FORM OF SPICULUM AND THE ONLY SPONGE IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND IN A PERFECT STATE IS THE DELICATE AND BEAUTIFUL ONE DESIGNATED BY PROFESSOR OWEN EUPLECTELLA CUCUMER THEY OCCUR IN GREAT PROFUSION EMBRACING THE MASS OF MATTER AT ITS BASE IN EVERY DIRECTION I PROPOSE THEREFORE TO DESIGNATE THIS FORM AS AN APICALLY SPINED RECURVOQUATERNATE SPICULUMN PLATE XXIII FIG 53 AS THE APICAL PORTION OF THE SPICULUM B A PORTION FROM THAT PART OF THE SHAFT AT WHICH THE SPINES BECOME OBSOLETE AS A SOLITARY INSTANCE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF A SPICULUM SO SINGULAR IN ITS FORM AND SO UNUSUAL IN ITS APPLICATION AND BEING LIKE THE CONNECTING SPICULA TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT INCORPORATED WITH THE SKELETON OF THE SPONGE I HAVE THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO DESCRIBE IT AS AN AUXILIARY FORM RATHER THAN TO CONSIDER IT AS THE TYPE OF A CLASS292 DR J S BOWERBANK ON THE ANATOMY BEFENSIVE SPICULA THERE ARE TWO CLASSES OF DEFENSIVE SPICULA 1ST THOSE OF THE EXTERIOR 2ND THOSE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE SPONGE THEY ARE NEITHER OF THEM NECESSARILY PRESENT IN EVERY SPECIES NOR ARE THEY CONFINED TO PARTICULAR GENERA BUT OCCUR OCCASIONALLY AND IN CERTAIN SPECIES OF VARIOUS GENERA APPA RENTLY AS THE NECESSITIES OF THE ANIMAL MAY RENDER THEIR PRESENCE REQUISITE IF THE EXTE RIOR OF THE ANIMAL BE AMPLY SUPPLIED WITH THEM THE INTERIOR RARELY POSSESSES THEM THEIR OFFICE IS EVIDENTLY TO DEFEND THE SPONGE FROM THE ATTACKS OF PREDACIOUS ANIMALS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE VERY PROBABLY DESTROY IT AND THUS IT IS THAT THE EXTERNAL DEFENSIVE SPICULA ARE FREQUENTLY OF MORE THAN THE USUAL LENGTH AND STRENGTH OF THESE ORGANS THEY ARE PROJECTED FOR ABOUT HALF OR TWOTHIRDS OF THEIR LENGTH AT VARIOUS ANGLES FROM THE SURFACE OF THE SPONGE APPARENTLY WITH THE OBJECT OF MEETING THE ATTACKS OF THE LARGER CLASS OF DEPREDATORS BUT AS BETWEEN THESE LARGE SPICULA THE SMALLER TRIBES OF ANNULATE ANIMALS WOULD READILY INSINUATE THEMSELVES THERE IS FREQUENTLY A SECONDARY SERIES OF DEFENCES CONSISTING OF INNUMERABLE SHORT FINELYPOINTED SPICULA THE APICES OF WHICH ARE PROJECTED A SHORT DISTANCE ONLY BEYOND THE SURFACE OF THE DERMAL MEMBRANE THUS RENDERING THE PROGRESS OF THE SMALLER AND MORE INSINUATING ENEMIES EXTREMELY DIFFI CULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE IN YOUNG SPONGES AS IN SPONGILLA FLUVIATILIS AND OTHERS THE OFFICE OF EXTERNAL DEFENSIVE SPICULA IS FREQUENTLY PERFORMED BY THE CONTINUED EXTENSION OF THE RADIAL LINES OF THE SKELETON THE TERMINAL SPICULA OF WHICH OFTEN PROJECT TO MORE THAN THE EXTREME LENGTH OF A SPICULUM BEYOND THE SURFACE OF THE DERMAL MEMBRANE WHEN THE DEFENSIVE SPICULA ARE INTERNAL THEY ASSUME A DIFFERENT CHARACTER FROM THE EXTERNAL ONES THE MOST COMMON FORM UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS THAT OF A SHORT STOUT ATTENUATOACUATE SPICULUM PROFUSELY AND ENTIRELY SPINED THEY ARE FIRMLY BASED IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE SKELETON AND THE GREATER PORTION OF THEIR LENGTH IS PROJECTED AT VARIOUS ANGLES FROM THE SIDES OF THE INTERSTITIAL CANALS AND CAVITIES OF THE SPONGE THEY WOULD THUS RENDER THE PASSAGE OF MINUTE ANNELIDS AND OTHER SMALL ENEMIES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND IN ONE INSTANCE THE MODE IN WHICH THE PROTECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE SPONGE IS PROVIDED FOR IS VERY REMARKABLE AND CURIOUS LARGE SPINULORECURVOQUATER NATE SPICULA WITH ATTENUATING RADII ARE GROUPED TOGETHER ON THE ANGLES OF THE NETWORK OF THE SKELETON AND ARE PROJECTED IN A RADIATING MANNER INTO THE CAVITIES OF THE INTERIOR OF THE SPONGE FORMING A MOST EFFECTUAL PREVENTION TO THE PASSAGE OF ANY SMALL ANIMAL THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS COMPLICATED AND BEAUTIFUL FORM OF SPICULUM IS A SINGULAR DEVIA TION FROM THE NORMAL MODE OF DEFENCE AND ALMOST INDUCES THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS INTENDED THAT SUCH INTRUDERS AS EFFECTED AN ENTRANCE WERE MEANT TO BE RETAINED AND THEIR DECOM POSED PARTICLES APPROPRIATED TO THE NUTRITION OF THE SPONGE IN OTHER CASES WHERE NO DEFINITE FORM OF DEFENSIVE SPICULUM FORMS A PART OF THE SPONGE THE OFFICE OF THOSE ORGANS IS FREQUENTLY PERFORMED BY THE PROJECTION OF SPICULA SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE SKELETON INTO THE CANALS AND CAVITIES OF THE INTERIORAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADJE 293 FUSIFORMIACERATE GEODIA BARRETTI BOWERBANK MS ON THIS REMARKABLY FINE SPECIES OF GEODIA THIS FORM OF DEFENSIVE SPICULUM OCCURS IN PARTS IN SUCH ABUNDANCE THAT THEY COMPLETELY COVER AND OBSCURE THE SURFACE OF THE SPONGE FROM WHICH THEY PRO JECT NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THEIR LENGTH THE PROXIMAL ENDS OF MANY OF THEM SCARCELY PASS ING THROUGH THE DERMAL CRUST OF THE SPONGE THIS SPONGE HAS ALSO A SECONDARY SERIES OF DEFENSIVE SPICULA OF THE SAME FORM AS THE LARGER ONES THE LATTER OFTEN EXCEEDING XTH OF AN INCH IN LENGTH WHILE THE SECONDARY SPICULA DO NOT EXCEED WITH OF AN INCH IN LENGTH FOR THE FORM OF THIS SPICULUM SEE PLATE XXIII FIG 10 ATTENUATOACUATE ENTIRELY SPINEDLDICTYO YLINDRUS VENTILABRUM BOWERBANK MS THIS SHORT FORM OF SPICULUM IS OF VERY FREQUENT OCCURRENCE IN THE INTERIOR OF SPONGES OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT GENERA THEY ARE USUALLY PROFUSELY SPINOUS AND ESPECIALLY AT THE BASE WHICH IS FIRMLY IMBEDDED IN THE KERATODE OF THE SKELETON THE SPINES ARE IRREGULARLY DISPERSED OVER ALL PARTS OF THE SHAFT TO THE VERY APEX OF THE SPICULUM THEY ARE PRO JECTED INTO THE INTERSTITIAL CAVITIES AND CANALS OF THE SPONGE AT ALL ANGLES TO THE AXIS OF THE SKELETON ON WHICH THEY ARE BASED AND NO DEGREE OF REGULARITY EXISTS IN THEIR MODE OF DISPERSION IN SOME SPONGES THEY OCCUR IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS BUT IN OTHERS WHERE THE ANIMAL IS WELL PROTECTED BY THE ABUNDANCE OF THE LARGE RADIAL SPICULA THEY ARE FEW IN NUMBER AND ARE NOT TO BE DETECTED WITHOUT A VERY CAREFUL SEARCH PLATE XXIV FIG 1 ACUATE ENTIRELY AND VERTICILLATELY SPINED PLATE XXIV FIG 2THIS FORM OF SPICULUM IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE AND BEAUTIFUL OF ITS TRIBE I HAVE FOUND IT IN TWO DISTINCT SPECIES OF SPONGE FROM THE WEST INDIES IN ONE IT IS IRREGULARLY DISPERSED AND IN THE OTHER IT IS COLLECTED INTO RADIATING GROUPS THE FORM OF THE SPICULUM IS SHORT STOUT AND REGULARLY ACUATE HAVING THE ACUTELYCONICAL SPINES ARRANGED IN NEARLY EQUIDISTANT RINGS OF A SINGLE SERIES EACH FROM THE BASE TO THE APEX OF THE SPICULUM CYLINDRICAL ENTIRELY AND VERTICILLATELY SPINED PLATE XXIV FIG 3I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE SPONGE WHENCE THIS BEAUTIFUL SPICULUM CAME I FOUND IT IN THE REFUSE MATTER FROM THE BASE OF A SPECIMEN OF OCULINA ROSEA FROM THE SOUTH SEAS THE SHAFT OF THE SPICULUM FROM END TO END HAS EQUIDISTANT RINGS OF SINGLE SERIES OF ACUTE CONICAL SPINES AND THE BASE AND APEX OF THE SPICULUM ARE EACH EQUALLY CROWDED WITH SPINES I HAVE ARRANGED IT AS A DEFENSIVE SPICULUM FROM ITS NEAR APPROXIMATION TO THE CHARACTERS OF THE SPICULUM LAST DESCRIBED BUT IT IS SUBJECT TO THE DOUBT WHETHER IT MAY NOT ULTIMATELY PROVE TO HAVE BELONGED TO THE SKELETON AS WE HAVE IN HALICHONDRIA INCRUSTANS JOHNSTON ENTIRELY SPINED ACUATE SPICULA FORMING THE SKELETON THE CHARAC TERS OF WHICH ARE SO CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE ATTENUATOACUATE DEFENSIVE SPICULA SO COMMON IN THE INTERIOR OF SOME SPONGES THAT HAD WE FOUND BUT A SINGLE SPICULUM OF THE SKELETON OF THAT SPONGE WE SHOULD VERY NATURALLY HAVE CONCLUDED IT TO HAVE BEEN AN INTERNAL DEFENSIVE SPICULUM SPINULORECURVOQUATERNATEI HAVE FOUND THIS REMARKABLE FORM OF SPICULUMIN ONE SPONGE ONLY AND I AM INDEBTED TO MY FRIEND MR THOMAS INGALL IN WHOSE CABINET IT IS FOR

FULLYDEVELOPED CONDITION THE APEX IS FORMED OF FOUR EQUIANGULAR ATTENUATED INCURRED RADII PLATE XXIV FIG 7 THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FORM OF SPICULUM IS INTER ESTING AND VERY INSTRUCTIVE IN AN EARLY STAGE OF ITS DEVELOPMENT IT HAS THE APPEAR ANCE OF A SLENDER INEQUIBICLAVATE CYLINDRICAL SPICULUM AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIV FIG 4 IN THE NEXT STAGE THERE IS A SLIGHT INDICATION OF THE SPINULATE BASE AND A CORRE SPONDING AMOUNT OF EXPANSION OF THE APEX BUT NO INDICATION OF THE RADII PLATE XXIV FIG 5 FROM THIS STATE TO THE NEXT WELLMARKED STAGE OF GROWTH REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIV FIG

THE THICKEST PORTION OF THE SHAFT THE TERNATE RADII ARE PROJECTED FROM THE APEX OF THE SHAFT AT ABOUT AN ANGLE OF 20 FROM ITS AXIS AND ARE ABOUT L 5 TH OF AN INCH IN LENGTH PLATE XXIV FIG 10 THE SHAFTS OF THESE SPICULA POSSESS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY AND AS THE CENTRAL CAVITIES OF THE RADII EXCEPTING AT THE APICES ARE OFTEN VERY LARGE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEY POSSESS FLEXIBILITY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ALSO AND THIS APPEARS TO BE THE CASE FROM THE SINGULAR CONTOR TIONS THAT THEY FREQUENTLY EXHIBIT ONE OF THESE ACCIDENTS IS WELL REPRESENTED PLATE XXIII FIG 1 WHICH EXHIBITS THE DISTAL END OF ONE OF THESE SPICULA IN THIS CASE IT IS EVIDENT THAT A VIOLENT DOWNWARD PRESSURE HAS BENT THE RAY WHILE IN A YOUNG CON DITION IN NO LESS THAN SIX DIFFERENT PLACES WITHOUT DESTROYING IT

DERMAL MEMBRANE AND IT TERMINATES IN A LARGE BULBOUS CAVITY AT THE BASE OF THE TERNATE RADII OF THE APEX IN THE MATURE SPICULA THREE SMALL TUBULAR CAVITIES TRAVERSE THE RADII FROM THE BASE TO THE APEX

THE SECOND CLASS IS THAT OF ASSISTING IN THE RETENTION OF THE SARCODE ON THE INTERSTITIAL AND OTHER MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURES THEY ARE USUALLY MINUTE IN SIZE AND OFTEN VERY COMPLICATED IN FORM I PROPOSE

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

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADAE 301 ABBREVIATED BIHAMATETHE BIHAMATE SPICULA ESPECIALLY THE SIMPLE FORM ARE SUB JECT TO CONSIDERABLE VARIETIES OF SIZE AND SHAPE SOMETIMES AS IN ABBREVIATED BIHA MATE WE HAVE THE HOOKS TERMINATING ABRUPTLY IMMEDIATELY BEYOND THE PROXIMAL CURVES AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIV FIG 42 I HAVE FOUND BUT VERY FEW SPECIMENS OF THIS FORM AND IN NO CASE IN SITU AND I AM THEREFORE IN DOUBT WHETHER IT BE AN ADULT SPICU LUM OR MERELY A VARIETY ARISING FROM AN ARREST OF DEVELOPMENT DEFLECTED BIHAMATEWHEN THE HAMI ARE BOTH DEFLECTED IN THE SAME DIRECTION AT NEARLY RIGHT ANGLES TO THE PLANE OF THE SHAFT PLATE XXIV FIG 43 THE VARIETY IN THE AMOUNT OF CURVATURE AT THE MIDDLE OF THE SHAFT OF THE SPICULUM IS ALSO VERY GREAT AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIV FIGS 39 42 AND 43 BUT THESE VARIATIONS ARE NOT PURELY ACCIDENTAL ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE MORE OR LESS CONSTANT IN EACH SPE CIES OF SPONGE AND FREQUENTLY AFFORD GOOD SPECIFIC CHARACTERS IN THE SIMPLE BIHAMATE FORM WHERE THE TWO HAMI ARE CURVED IN THE SAME PLANE AND TOWARDS EACH OTHER THE SPICULUM IN ITS NATURAL CONDITION IS USUALLY ATTACHED TO THE SURFACE OF THE MEMBRANE BY THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK OF THE CURVED SHAFT AND THE TWO HOOKS ARE PROJECTED INTO THE SARCODE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE PLANE OF THE MEMBRANE ON WHICH IT IS BASED WHEN THE HAMI ARE DEVELOPED REVERSED OR AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER ONE OF THEM IS THEN USUALLY IMBEDDED SIDEWAYS ON THE MEMBRANE AND THE OTHER WITH THE SHAFT IS PROJECTED FROM THE PLANE BENEATH INTO THE SARCODE AT VARIOUS DEGREES OF ANGLE OR IN THE DEFLECTED FORM THE SHAFT MAY BE FIRMLY CEMENTED TO THE MEMBRANE BY ONE SIDE WHILE THE HAMI ARE BOTH PROJECTED UPWARD INTO THE MASS OF SARCODE IN SOME SPECIES OF SPONGE ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE FORMS MORE ESPECIALLY PREVAILS BUT IN OTHERS AS IN IALICHONDRIA INCRUSTANS JOHNSTON THE SIMPLE REVERSED AND CONTORT FORMS ARE INDISCRIMINATELY MIXED IN THE TISSUES AND THEY OCCUR IN EVERY IMAGINABLE FORM OF ATTACHMENT IN GREAT PROFUSION AND ACCOMPANIED BY THE ANCHORATE FORMS AS WELL THE TYPE OF THIS FORM OF SPICULUM THE SIMPLE BIHAMATE IS NOT PECULIAR TO THE SPON GIADAEE IT OCCURS IN A MUCH MORE HIGHLY ORGANIZED CLASS IN A RADIATE ANIMAL ECHINUS SPHERA FORBES  BRITISH STARFISHES WHERE WE FIND AN ABUNDANCE OF THESE ORGANS DISPOSED ON THE EXTERNAL SURFACE OF THE TUBULAR SUCKERS OF THE ANIMAL BUT THEY ARE COMPOSED OF CARBONATE OF LIME INSTEAD OF SILEX I AM INDEBTED TO MY FRIEND MR JOHN HOWARD STEWART FOR MY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS INTERESTING FACT SOMETIMES THE SIMPLE FORMS OF BIHAMATE SPICULA HAVE THE MIDDLE OF THE SHAFT UMBO NATE AND THIS OCCURRENCE IS SUBJECT TO THREE VARIETIES EXTERUMBONATEWHEN THE UMBO IS ON THE MIDDLE OF THE OUTER CURVE OF THE SHAFT PLATE XXIV FIG 44 INTERUMBONATEWHEN THE UMBO IS ON THE MIDDLE OF THE INNER CURVE OF THE SHAFT PLATE XXIV FIG 45 BIUMBONAT EWHEN THE MIDDLE OF BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER CURVE OF THE SHAFT HAVE AN UMBO PLATE XXIV FIG 46 CLAVATED BIHAMATETHIS SINGULAR FORM OF BIHAMATE SPICULUM WAS FOUND BY MR TOPPING IN A SMNALL PIECE OF SPONGE FROM THE COAST OF SICILY THE TERMINATIONS OF THE302 DR J S BOWERBANK ON THE ANATOMY HAMI BEING DISTENDED IN THE FORM OF LARGE ROUND OR OVOID MASSES AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIV FIGS 47 48 AND 49 I FOUND THE REMAINS OF THE MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURES CROWDED WITH THESE VERY MINUTE SPICULA WHICH VARIED EXCEEDINGLY IN FORM AND IN AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT AND AMONG THEM WERE A GREAT VARIETY OF OTHER FORMS OF BIHAMATE SPI CULA UNICLAVATE BIHAMATE PLATE XXIV FIG 47 I BELIEVE TO BE AN ARREST OF DEVELOP MENT RATHER THAN A SEPARATE FORM FOR ALTHOUGH I FOUND MANY SPECIMENS OF IT INTER MIXED WITH THE BICLAVATE FORMS I ALSO FOUND OTHERS ASSUMING TRANSITIONAL FORMS THAT APPEARED ULTIMATELY TO CONNECT IT WITH THE BICLAVATE SPICULA BICLAVATE BIHAMATE PLATE XXIV FIGS 48 AND 49THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE VARIA TION IN THE SHAPE OF THIS SPICULUM THE FORM REPRESENTED BY FIGURE 48 IS PERHAPS THE MOST NUMEROUS BUT THAT OF FIGURE 49 IS THE LARGEST AND MOST FULLY DEVELOPED IN A NEW SPECIES OF BRITISH SPONGE ILALICHONDRIA 1YNDMANI BOWERBANK MS WE FIND ANOTHER FORM OF EXPANDED TERMINATION TO THE HAMI THE POCILLATED BIHAMATE WHICH GRADUALLY LEADS US TO THE TRUE ANCHORATE FORMS IN THE SIMPLE FORM OF POCILLATED BIHAMATE SPICULA THE TERMINATIONS OF THE CURVED SHAFT RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO TWO NEARLY EQUAL CIRCULAR CONCAVOCONVEX PLATES THE CONVEX SURFACES BEING IN EACH CASE OUTWARD AND THE SIDES OF EACH PLATE CURVING CON SIDERABLY TOWARDS THE OTHER THEIR PLANES BEING AT A RIGHT ANGLE TO THE AXIS OF THE SHAFT IN OTHER CASES ONE CUP WILL BE DEVELOPED WITH ITS PLANE IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS TH E AXIS OF THE SHAFT WHILE THE OTHER CUP IS PRODUCED WITH ITS PLANE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE AXIS AND ALSO OF THE PLANE OF THE FIRST CUP IN THESE VARIATIONS OF DEVELOPMENT THERE FORE THIS FORM OF SPICULUM MAY BE COMPARED TO THE SIMPLE AND CONTORT FORMS OF BIHA MATE SPICULA AND IN TRUTH THEY DIFFER FROM THEM ONLY IN THIS THAT IN THE ONE THE TERMINATIONS OF THE HAMI ARE ATTENUATED AND ACUTE AND IN THE OTHER THEY ARE EXPANDED INTO CONCAVOCONVEX DISCS THESE TWO MODES OF DEVELOPMENT APPEAR TO BE SUBJECT TO A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF VARIATION IN THE GROWTH OF THE TERMINAL DISCS AS IN SOME CASES WE FIND THE DISTAL PART OF THE TERMINAL PLATE TO CONSIST OF A UNIFORM CURVE WHILE IN OTHER CASES THE SHAFT IS CARRIED THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THAT CURVE FORMING AS IT WERE A SUPPLEMENTAL HOOK THESE VARIATIONS ARE IN PERFECT ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL LAWS OF DEVELOPMENT IN THIS CLASS OF SPICULA AS WE FIND BOTH IN THE BIHAMATE AND ANCHORATE FORMS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE STRUCTURE AND POSITION OF THESE ORGANS IN THE SAME SPECIES OF SPONGE UNIPOCILLATED BIHAMATE PLATE XXIV FIG 50ONE TERMINATION FULLY DEVELOPED IN THE FORM OF A CUP WHILE THE OTHER IS ONLY PRODUCED TO THE EXTENT OF THE TWO LATERAL CURVES AND A TERMINAL UMBO TO THE SHAFT SIMPLE BIPOCILLATED BIHAMATE PLATE XXIV FIG 51HAVING BOTH TERMINATIONS DEVELOPED

ONLY PLATE XXIV FIG 54 A VIEW IN PROFILE OF A UNIPOCILLATED SPICULUM THE UPPER PART OF THE FIGURE REPRESENTS A SIDE VIEW OF THE CUP WHILE THE TERMINATION OF THE LOWER POR TION IS MORE THAN USUALLY ELONGATED SHOWING HOW THE UMBONATION IS PRODUCED ON THE DISTAL EDGE OF THE SPICULUM REPRESENTED BY FIG 53 THE TRANSITION FROM THE POCILLATED BIHAMATE TO THE MORE FULLY DEVELOPED AND BEAUTIFUL ANCHORATE SPICULA IS EASY AND NATURAL THE TERMINATIONS ARE MORE ELABORATELY ADAPTED TO THEIR RETENTIVE PURPOSES AND THE MECHANISM OF THE CURVED BOW WITH THE BROAD PALMATE TERMINATIONS OF THE ANCHOR WHICH COST MAN THE ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM OF AGES TO BRING TO PERFECTION IS WONDERFULLY FORESHADOWED IN THESE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ORGANS ANCHORCTE SPICULA THE ANCHORATE SPICULA UNLIKE THE BIHAMATE FORMS APPEAR NEVER TO OCCUR REVERSED OR CONTORTED BUT ALWAYS TO PRESENT THEIR TERMINATIONS IN THE SAME POSITION AS THOSE OF THE BOW OF AN ORDINARY SHIPS ANCHOR IN SOME SPONGES THEY ARE TOLERABLY UNIFORM IN SHAPE AND PROPORTIONS WHILE IN OTHERS THEY VARY EXCEEDINGLY NOT ONLY WHILE IN COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT BUT EVEN IN THEIR ADULT CONDITION THEY GLIDE SO INSENSIBLY FROM ONE FORM INTO ANOTHER THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM AND YET NOTWITH STANDING THIS LATITUDE INSHAPE AND DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE VERY CHARACTERISTIC OF SPECIES AS THERE ARE ALWAYS A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF FULLY DEVELOPED ONES THAT EXHIBIT THE NORMAL FORM IN ALMOST EVERY CASE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE BESIDE THE LARGE AND FULLY DEVELOPED ORGANS WE FIND A SECONDARY SERIES ACCOMPANYING THEM WHICH ARE VERY MUCH SMALLER IN SIZE AND VARY EXCEEDINGLY BOTH IN SYMMETRY AND AMOUNT OF DEVELOPMENT AND THERE IS EVERY APPEARANCE THAT THEY ARE SIMPLY ABORTIVE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE LARGER AND MORE PERFECT ORGANS WITH WHICH THEY ALWAYS APPEAR TO AGREE IN THEIR NORMAL CHARACTERS THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY DIVISIONS OF THESE FORMS OF SPICULAEQUIANCHORATE WHEN BOTH TERMINATIONS ARE PRODUCED TO AN EQUAL EXTENT AS IN PLATE XXIV FIG 57 OR PLATE XXV FIGS 1 AND 2 AND INEQUIANCHORATE WHEN THE DISTAL TERMINATION IS LARGELY AND FULLY DEVELOPED WHILE THE PROXIMAL ONE IS COMPARATIVELY PRODUCED TO A VERY LIMITED EXTENT AS IN PLATE XXIV FIGS 55 AND 56 EACH OF THESE IS SUBJECT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TO SIMILAR DEGREES OF FURTHER DIVERSITY OF FORM WHICH MAY BE DESIGNATED BIDENTATE TRI DENTATE AND PALMATE THESE FORMS ARE IN TRUTH BUT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE NORMAL PALMATE FORM BUT AS WE FIND THESE VARIATIONS CONSTANT IN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SPONGES IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THEY SHOULD BE SEPARATELY DESIGNATED AS THEY AFFORD EXCELLENT SPECIFIC CHARACTERS THUS IN HALICHONDRIA GRANULATA BOWERBANK MS A NEW BRITISH SPONGE WE FIND LARGE EQUIANCHORATE SPICULA IN WHICH THE LATERAL EXPANSIONS OF EACH END OF THE CURVED SHAFT OR BOW WHICH FORMS THE PALMATE TERMINATIONS OF THE SPICU LUM EXTEND ALONG THE SHAFT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE BOW VERY LITTLE BEYOND THE POINT MDCCCLVIII 2 T304 DR J S BOWERBANK ON THE ANATOMY OF CURVATURE FORMING THE BASAL COMMENCEMENTS OF THE HOOKS BUT ALTHOUGH NOT DECUR RENT ON THE SHAFT THE LINES OF THE INNER MARGINS ARE PROJECTED FORWARD AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 45 DEGREES TO THE AXIS OF THE SHAFT AND AS THE OUTER LINES ARE PROJECTED IN A CORRESPONDING DEGREE WE HAVE THE PALM PRODUCED IN THE FORM OF TWO CONCAVE CONICAL TEETH OR PALMS AT EACH END OF THE SPICULUM AND BETWEEN THESE THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST APPEARANCE OF THE ENDS OF THE HAMI WHICH APPEAR TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TERMINAL PALMS OR TEETH THIS FORM I THEREFORE PROPOSE TO TERM BIDENTATE EQUI ANCHORATE THE SAME TERMINATION OCCURS AMONG THE INEQUIANCHORATE FORMS AND THIS MODE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEETH IS WELL SHOWN IN THE DISTAL OR LARGER PORTION OF THE BIDENTATE INEQUIANCHORATE SPICULUM REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXIV FIG 55 IN OTHER CASES THE TERMINATION OF EACH HOOK DOES NOT THUS MERGE IN THE TEETH BUT IS CARRIED FOR WARD BETWEEN THEM EITHER IN THE FORM OF A SIMPLE ATTENUATED TERMINATION AS REPRE SENTED IN PLATE XXIV FIG 57 OR IT EXPANDS LATERALLY AND FORMS A THIRD INTERMEDIATE TOOTH OF A HASTATE FORM AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXV FIG 7 IN EITHER OF THESE CASES I THEREFORE PROPOSE TO DESIGNATE THE SPICULUM AS TRIDENTATE IN OTHER CASES THE LATERAL EXPANSIONS FORMING THE PALM ARE CONTINUED ALONG THE SHAFT OF THE SPICULUM TO NEARLY OR QUITE THE FULL EXTENT OF THE PALM FORMING A SINGLE UNDIVIDED MORE OR LESS CONCAVE TERMINATION AS IN PLATE XXIV FIG 56 I PROPOSE THEREFORE TO DESIGNATE THIS FORM AS PALMATOANCHORATE AND INTERMEDIATE FORMS BETWEEN THE DECIDEDLY DENTATE OR PALMATE ONES WOULD BE DESIGNATED AS TRIDENTATOPALMATE PLATE XXV FIG 7 THE PALMATE FORM BEING IN EXCESS OF THE DENTATE STRUCTURE OR PALMATO TRI OR BIDENTATE WHEN THE TEETH ARE IN THE ASCENDANT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE ENDS OF THE SHAFT OF EACH ANCHORATE SPICULUM EITHER BECOME OBSOLETE AT THE BASE OF THE TEETH AS IN BIDENTATE FORMS OR THEY ARE CONTINUED IN A REGU LAR CURVE FORMING THE THIRD TOOTH AS IN THE TRIDENTATE FORM BUT IN SOME CASES AS IN IALICHONDRIA PLUWOSA JOHNSTON THE SHAFT APPEARS TO TERMINATE ABRUPTLY AT EACH END AND THE PALMS OR TEETH ARE PROJECTED TOWARDS EACH OTHER AT A SHARP ANGLE TO THE ENDS OF THE SHAFT OR BOW OF THE SPICULUM IN THIS CASE WE SHOULD TERM THE SPICULUM ANGULATED ANCHORATE AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXV FIGS 1 2 AND 3 THE ANCHORATE SPICULA ARE NOT LIKE THE ACERATE ACUATE AND OTHER SIMPLE FORMS OF THE SAME SHAPE OR NEARLY SO FROM THE COMMENCEMENT TO THE TERMINATION OF THEIR GROWTH BUT ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE DEVELOPED PROGRESSIVELY IN A NEW SPECIES OF HALICHONDRIA FOR WHICH I AM INDEBTED TO MY FRIEND MR THOMAS INGALL THE COURSE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS DISPLAYED IN A VERY INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE MANNER THE FIRST CONDITION IN WHICH WE DETECT THEM IS IN THE FORM OF AN EXCEEDINGLY SLENDER AND ELONGATED SIMPLE BIHAMATE SPICULUM WHICH IS READILY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE TRUE BIHAMATE FORM BY THE STRAIGHTNESS OF THE SHAFT THE COMPARATIVE SHORTNESS OF THE HAMI AND THE OBTUSENESS OF THEIR TERMINATIONS AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXV FIG 4 WE NEXT FIND THE SAME FORM INCREASED IN STRENGTH AND WITH SLIGHT LATERAL FIMBRIA NEAR EACH END OF THE SHAFT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE HAMI AS IN PLATE XXV FIG 5 IN A MORE ADVANCED STAGE WE FIND A REGULARLY CURVED EXTENSION OF THE FIMBRIE SLIGHTLY SOAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADE 305 AT ONE EXTREMITY OF THE SHAFT AND CONSIDERABLY SO AT THE OTHER AND AS THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES THE CURVES OF THE FIMBRIAE ARE EXTENDED IN AN OUTWARD DIRECTION AND BECOME ANGULAR THE EXTREMITIES OF THE HAMI EXPAND LATERALLY AND ASSUME A FOLIATED APPEARANCE AS SEEN IN THE DISTAL OR LARGER END ESPECIALLY PLATE XXV FIG 6 BUT THE FIMBRIAE AT THE SMALLEST OR PROXIMAL END OF THE SPICULUM AND THE FOLIATED EXTREMITY OF THE ADJOINING HAMUS ARE STILL SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AND THIS PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT MAY BE OBSERVED IN ALL ITS STAGES UNTIL THE CONNEXION OF THE PARTS IS COMPLETED AND THE FULLY DEVELOPED FORM REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXV FIG 7 IS PRODUCED THE SAME PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS FORM OF SPICULUM MAY BE TRACED IN THOSE OF HALICHONDRIA LINGUA BOWERBANX MS A NEW SPECIES OF BRITISH SPONGE FROM THE HEBRIDES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR NATURAL OFFICE IN THE SPONGE WE FIND THE SAME LAWS OF ATTACHMENT AND PROJECTION OBTAIN THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED IN TREATING OF THE BIHAMATE SPICULA IN THE EQUIANCHORATE FORMS WHERE THE TERMINAL PALMS OR TEETH ARE EQUALLY DEVELOPED THE SHAFT IS ATTACHED BY THE MIDDLE OF THE EXTERNAL CURVE BUT IN THE INEQUI ANCHORATE FORMS WHERE ONE PALM IS DEVELOPED TO A VERY MUCH GREATER EXTENT THAN THE OTHER WE FIND THE SMALLER ONE IS ATTACHED TO THE MEMBRANE AND THE LARGER IS PROJECTED AT ABOUT AN ANGLE OF 45 DEGREES GENERALLY SPEAKING THE ANCHORATE SPICULA LIKE THE BIHAMATE ONES ARE IRREGULARLY DISPERSED OVER THE SURFACE OF THE MEMBRANES BUT OCCASION ALLY AS IN FALICHONDRIA LINGUA THEY ARE DEVELOPED IN CIRCLES OR ROSETTEFORMED GROUPS AS MAY BE IMAGINED FROM THEIR OFFICE AND SITUATION IN A THIN STRATUM OF A GELATINOID SARCODE THEY ARE AT ALL TIMES SMALL AND IN MANY CASES SO MINUTE AS TO REQUIRE A MICRO SCOPIC POWER OF AT LEAST 600 LINEAR TO RENDER THEIR STRUCTURE DISTINCTLY VISIBLE THEY OCCUR IN ALL PARTS OF THE SARCODOUS SURFACE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE SPONGE AND ARE FRE QUENTLY FOUND IN GREATER PROFUSION THAN USUAL ON THE INNER OR SARCODOUS SURFACE OF THE DERMAL MEMBRANE BUT I DO NOT RECOLLECT AN INSTANCE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE ON THE OUTER SURFACE OF THAT ORGAN WHILE ON THE SARCODOUS OR INTERSTITIAL MEMBRANES THEY ARE FRE QUENTLY TO BE OBSERVED IN ABOUT EQUAL PROPORTIONS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE SAME MEM BRANE IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY TO DESCRIBE OR FIGURE THE WHOLE OF THESE VARIABLE FORMS OF SPICULA I HAVE THEREFORE SELECTED THOSE ONLY THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED MORE ESPECIALLY AS TYPE FORMS TRIDENTATE EQUIANCHORATE PLATE XXIV FIG 57HAVING EACH TERMINATION EQUALLY AND FULLY DEVELOPED IN THE FORM OF TWO LATERAL AND SLIGHTLY PALMATE AND ONE CENTRAL

SHORT OBTUSE TOOTH FROM SPONGIA LOBATA MONTAGT IN THE COLLECTION OF PROFESSOR GRANT X 1060 DENTATOPALMATE ANGULATED ANCHORATE PLATE XXV FIGS 1 2 3I HAVE FOUND THIS FORM OF SPICULUM ONLY IN SPONGICT PLUMNOSA MONTAGU EACH OF THE HAMI APPEAR AS IF FORCIBLY COMPRESSED TOWARDS THE TERMINATION OF THE SHAFT WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN EQUALLY INFLUENCED BY THE COMPRESSION SO THAT THE HAMI HAVE BECOME ANGULATED AS REPRESENTED IN THE PROFILE VIEW OF ONE OF THE SPICULA PLATE XXV FIG 3 THE WHOLE OF THE SPICULA ARE DENTATOPALMATE AND THE ADULT ONES HAVE THE TERMINATIONS OF THE HAMI STRONGLY PRODUCED AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXV FIG 1 WHILE IN THE IMMATURE SPICULA ALTHOUGH THE PALMS ARE FULLY PRODUCED THE TOOTH APPEARS IN A RUDIMENTARY CONDITION AS IN PLATE XXV FIG 2 SPICULA OF THE SARCODE AS THE TENSION SPICULA OF THE MEMBRANES ARE DESTINED TO STRENGTHEN AND SUPPORT THOSE TISSUES SO THE NUMEROUS AND BEAUTIFUL TRIBE OF STELLATE SPICULA APPEAR TO BE DEVOTED TO CONNECT AND GIVE SUBSTANCE TO THE GELATINOID SARCODE WHICH SO ABUNDANTLY COVERS THE WHOLE OF THE INTERIOR MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURES OF THE SPONGES IN WHICH THEY OCCUR IT IS DIFFICULT AT FIRST SIGHT TO DETERMINE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OFFICE OF THIS CLASS OF SPICULA AND THOSE OF THE INTERNAL RETENTIVE ONES AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT IN SOME CASES WHEN IT SO HAPPENS THAT THE RADII OF THE STELLATE FORMS REST ON AND BECOME CEMENTED TO THE MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURES THEY MAY PERFORM TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE SAME FUNCTION THAT OF ASSISTING TO CONNECT THE MEMBRANES AND SARCODOUS STRUCTURES MORE FIRMLY TOGETHER BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE SMALLER FORMS OF THESE ORGANS FOR IN COMPARATIVELY THICK LAYERS OF SARCODE WE FIND THEM IN ALL PARTS AND MANIFESTLY UNCONNECTED WITH THE MEMBRANES BENEATH AND IN SPONGES WHICH HAVE UNDER GONE SUCH AN AMOUNT OF DECOMPOSITION AS TO LEAVE THE MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURES ENTIRELY OR VERY NEARLY FREE FROM SARCODE WHILE WE SEE THE RETENTIVE FORMS REMAINING FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE MEMBRANES WE RARELY FIND THE STELLATE ONES EXCEPTING WHEN ENTANGLED AMONG THE SURROUNDING SPICULA OF THE SKELETON WE MAY THEREFORE REASONABLY CON CLUDE THAT THEIR NORMAL FUNCTION IS THAT OF INCREASING THE STRENGTH AND SUBSTANCE OF THE SARCODOUS STRUCTURE OF THE SPONGE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS OFFICE OF STRENGTHENING AND SUPPORTING THE SARCODE WE FIND A SINGULAR CLASS OF SPICULA CONSISTING OF FROM THREE TO SIX RAYS EMANATING FROM A COMMON CENTRE AND ALWAYS DISPOSED AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER BETWEEN THE EXTREME FORMS OF DEVELOPMENT OF THESE AND THE SIMPLE STELLATE SPICULA THERE IS A VERY GREAT AMOUNT OF STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE BUAT ON A MORE INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE INTERMEDIATEAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADA 307 FORMS WE FIND THEM PASSING INTO EACH OTHER SO GRADUALLY AS FINALLY TO CONNECT THE WHOLE INTO ONE GROUP SIMPLE STELLATE SPICULA STELLATE SPICULA ARE COMPOSED OF FEW OR MANY RADII EMANATING FROM A CENTRE IN ALL DIRECTIONS THEIR SIMPLEST FORM IS WHEN THE BASES OF THE RADII ALL PROCEED FROM A COM MON CENTRAL POINT PLATE XXV FIG 9 IN WHICH CASE THEY SHOULD BE DESIGNATED SIMPLY STELLATE SPICULA BUT WHEN THE RADII SPRING SEPARATELY AND DISTINCTLY FROM A COMMON CENTRAL SPHERICAL OR OVAL BASE THEY SHOULD BE DESIGNATED SPHEROSTELLATE SPICULA PLATE XXV FIGS 13 16 17 IN BOTH THESE CLASSES OF SPICULA THERE IS A VERY CONSIDER ABLE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR

PROPORTIONS OF THESE SPICULA VARY CONSIDERABLY SOMETIMES THE DISTAL TERMINATIONS OF THE RADII ARE SLIGHTLY INCLINED TO BE CLAVATE AND AT OTHERS THERE IS A GRADUAL TRANSITION FROM SIMPLY STELLATE TO

IS NEVER SEEN SPHEROSTELLATE PLATE XXV FIG 15HAVING THE RADII ACUTELY CONICAL AND BASED ON A LARGE CENTRAL SPHERE OF GREATER DIAMETER THAN THE LENGTH OF THE RADII TETHEA ROBUSTA BOWERBANK MS A NEW SPECIES FROM AUSTRALIA IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM PRESENTS AN EXCELLENT TYPE OF THIS FORM OF SPICULUM AS THE CENTRAL NUCLEUS APPEARS UNDER FAVOUR ABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WE DISTINCTLY TRACE A CENTRAL CANAL IN EACH RAY PASSING FROM THE CENTRE OF THE SPHERE TO NEAR THE DISTAL TERMINATION OF EACH OF THE RADII AS REPRESENTED IN PLATE XXV FIG 17 THESE CANALS ARE NOT USUALLY APPARENT IN THE PERFECT SPICULA PRO BABLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE FLUID BEING HERMETICALLY SEALED WITHIN THE CANALS OF THE RADII BUT I COULD NOT DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF THE FLUID BY POLARIZED LIGHT SPHEROSTELLATE WITH CYLINDROSUBFOLIATE RADII PLATE XXV FIG 16HAVING THE CYLINDRICAL RADII SLIGHTLY EXPANDED AND SOMEWHAT FOLIATED AT THE DISTAL EXTREMITIES THIS REMARKABLE FORM WAS OBTAINED BY WASHING SOME SPECIMENS OF OCULINA ROSEA FROM

SINGULARLY VARIABLE SPICULA ARE ABUNDANT IN SPONGILLA PLUMOSA CARTER THEY ARE REMARKABLE AS AFFORDING A SERIES OF TRANSITIONAL FORMS FROM A SINGLE STRAIGHT SPICULUM TO THE REGULAR MULTIRADIATE STELLATE ONE FIG 20 REPRESENTS ABOUT THE FIRST STAGE OF VARIATION FROM THE SIMPLE ELONGATE SPINOUS SPICULUM A FEW RATHER STRONGLY PRODUCED CYLINDRICAL SPINES APPEARING NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE SHAFT IN FIG 21 TWO OF THESE SPINES ARE CONSIDERABLY MORE ELONGATED THAN THOSE IN FIG 20 AND THE SHAFT IS NOT SO LONG AS THAT OF FIG 20 IN FIG 22 THE AXIAL SHAFT IS STILL MORE CURTAILED IN ITS PROPORTIONS AND THE CENTRAL RADII ARE FURTHER ELONGATED AND INCREASED IN NUMBER AND IN FIG 23 WE FIND THE AXIAL SPICULUM SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE LATERAL RAYS WHEN THE RADII PROJECTED ARE FEW IN NUMBER THEY ARE USUALLY AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE AXIAL SPICULUM BUT WHEN THEY ARE PRODUCED IN GREATER NUMBERS THEY ARE PROJECTED AT VARIOUSAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIAD2E 309 ANGLES AND THE AXIAL SPICULUM CAN SCARCELY BE DETECTED IN SPICULA HAVING NUMEROUS RADII THEY FREQUENTLY UNITE AT THEIR BASES AND PRODUCE THEIR EXTREME VARIATION OF FORM A SUBSPHEROSTELLATE SPICULUM NO TWO OF THESE SINGULAR SPICULA ARE ALIKE AND THEY PRESENT EVERY IMAGINABLE VARIATION IN THE MODE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR ORIGIN FROM AN AXIAL SPICULUM AND IN THEIR TENDENCY TO THE PROJECTION OF SECONDARY RADII AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THAT AXIS THESE SPICULA FORM A CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE SIMPLE MULTIRA DIATE FORMS AND THE MORE COMPLICATED ONES BELONGING TO THE NEXT DIVISION OF THE SUBJECT COMPOUND STELLATE SPICULA THE CURIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF THIS SERIES OF SPICULA ALL BELONG TO THE CLASS OF SPONGES THAT HAVE A SKELETON COMPOSED OF SILICEOUS FIBRE AND THEY ARE PRINCIPALLY FROM TROPICAL CLIMATES THE CENTRAL BASAL STRUCTURE FROM WHICH THE RADII ARE PROJECTED IN EVERY CASE WITH WHICH I AM ACQUAINTED IS A RECTANGULATED HEXRADIATE SPICULUM FROM THE APICES OF WHICH A VARIETY OF BEAUTIFUL TERMINATIONS ARE PROJECTED WHICH VARY IN FORM EXCEEDINGLY IN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SPONGES IN THE CLASS OF SPONGES TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS RECTANGULATED SPICULA VARYING IN THE NUMBER OF RADII FROM THREE TO SIX THE APICES OF THE RADII BEING EITHER ACUTELY TERMINATED OR MORE OR LESS CLAVATED AND THESE FORMS VARY VERY MUCH IN SIZE THEY ARE UNCONNECTED WITH THE SKELETON AND EVIDENTLY BELONG TO THE SARCODOUS SYSTEM OF THE SPONGE THEY ARE VERY MUCH LARGER THAN THE HEXRADIATE CENTRES OF THE COMPOUND STELLATE SPICULA BUT AS THEY ARE EVIDENTLY THE NORMAL FORMS OF THAT TRIBE I SHALL DESCRIBE THE GENERAL CHARACTERS OF THESE LARGE SIMPLE HEXRADIATE FORMS BEFORE THOSE OF THE MORE COMPLICATED STELLATE ONES ATTENUATED RECTANGULATED IEEXRADIATE PLATE XXV FIG 32THE FIRST STATE IN WHICH WE FIND THEM IS IN THAT OF AN INEQUIACERATE SPICULUM PLATE XXV FIG 24 IN WHICH CONDITION THEY ARE IN FACT THE TWO AXIAL RADII OF THE HEXRADIATE FORM WHICH THEY ULTIMATELY ATTAIN WHEN IN THEIR FULLEST STATE OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE NEXT STAGE WE FIND A BUDLIKE PROJECTION ISSUING FROM THE SIDE OF THE THICKEST PORTION OF THE INEQUI ACERATE SPICULUM FIG 25 WHICH IS ULTIMATELY DEVELOPED IN THE FORM OF A RECTANGULATED TRIRADIATE SPICULUM AS IN FIG 28 OR TWO BUDS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROJECTED AS IN FIGS 26 AND 27 AND THE RESULT IS A REGULAR RECTANGULATED QUADRIRADIATE FORM AS IN FIG 30 OR IF THE SECOND RAY BE AT A RIGHT ANGLE TO THE ONE FIRST PROJECTED THE RESULT IS AN IRRE GULAR QUADRIRADIATE FIGURE AS REPRESENTED BY FIG 29 IN LIKE MANNER THE IRREGULAR PENTRADIATE FORM ARISES FROM THE ABSENCE OF ONE OF THE FOUR SECONDARY RAYS AS IN FIG 31 OR IT SOMETIMES OCCURS THAT THE APICAL PORTION OF THE INEQUIACERATE AXIAL SPICULUM IS DEFICIENT AND THEN THE RESULT IS AS REPRESENTED BY FIG 33 A REGULAR PENTRADIATE FORM IF THE WHOLE OF THE RADII ARE EQUALLY PRODUCED THE RESULT IS THEN THE REGULAR ATTENUATED RECTANGULATED HEXRADIATE SPICULUM FIG 32 SOMETIMES BUT RARELY WE FIND A SINGLE RAY MORE OR LESS SPINOUS AT ITS DISTAL END IN THIS CASE IT IS PROBABLE THAT IT WAS ATTACHED BY THAT POINT TO THE MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURE OR TO SOME PART OF THE KERATODE OF THE SKELETON THE WHOLE OF THESE INTERESTING SPICULA WERE OBTAINED FROM MR CUMINGS SPECIMEN OF310 DR J S BOWERBANK ON THE ANATOMY EUPLECTELLA ASPERYILLUM THEY ARE ABUNDANT IN THAT SPONGE FREQUENTLY FILLING UP THE INTERSTICES OF THE NETWORK OF THE SILICEOUS SKELETON OR OTHERWISE ENTANGLED IN THE TISSUES IN DR A FARRES SPECIMEN OF EUPLECTELLA THEY ARE EQUALLY ABUNDANT AND ARE NOT TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THOSE IN MR CUMINGS SPECIMEN THEY ARE LIKE THE GREAT EXTERNAL PREHENSILE SPICULA AND THE FIBRE OF THE SKELETON COMPOSED OF NUMEROUS CONCENTRIC LAYERS OF SILEX WHICH READILY SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER BY DECOMPOSITION I CANNOT SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT THIS TRIBE OF SPICULA BELONG REALLY TO THE SARCODE AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN SPECIMENS OF EITHER OF THE SPECIES I HAVE NAMED IN WHICH THEY OCCUR IN PROFUSION IN SUCH A STATE OF PRESERVATION AS TO ALLOW OF THEIR POSITION BEING POSITIVELY DETERMINED BUT AS IN ANOTHER SPECIMEN OF SPONGE WITH A SILICEOUS SKELETON LIKE THAT OF DACTYLOCALYX PJNICEA STUTCHBURY THE SARCODE IS PRESERVED IN EXCELLENT CON DITION AND OCCURS IN SUCH ABUNDANCE FILLING ALL THE INTERSTICES OF THE SKELETON OF THE SPONGE AND AFFORDING AMPLE SPACE FOR THE IMBEDMENT OF SUCH SPICULA IN ITS SUBSTANCE I AM THEREFORE INDUCED TO THINK IT PROBABLE THAT A SIMILAR ABUNDANCE OF SARCODE MAY EXIST IN DACTYLOCALYX AND OTHER SIMILARLY CONSTITUTED SPONGES AND THAT HEREAFTER EVEN THE LARGEST OF THIS TRIBE OF SPICULA WILL BE FOUND COMPLETELY IMBEDDED IN THE SARCODE SLENDER ATTENUATED RECTANGULATED HEXRADIATE PLATE XXV FIG 34BESIDE THE LARGE AND STOUT ATTENUATOHEXRADIATE SPICULA IN EUPLECTELLA ASPERGILLUM THERE ARE COMPARATIVELY SMALL AND VERY SLENDER ONES MANY OF WHICH ARE NEARLY OF THE SAME PRO PORTIONS AS THE LARGER ONES BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE AXIAL RADII ARE MORE ELONGATED AND IN SOME CASES THE BASAL END IS EXTENDED TO FOUR OR SIX TIMES THE LENGTH OF THE APICAL PORTION THESE SPICULA DO NOT PRESENT THE SAME IRREGULARITY IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT THAT WE OBSERVE IN THE STOUT ONES AND IT IS A RARE OCCURRENCE TO FIND ONE WITHOUT THE FULL NUMBER OF RAYS THEY ARE EXCEEDINGLY NUMEROUS IN THE SPONGE AND THEY OCCUR IN CLOSELY PACKED FASCICULI THE AXES OF THE SPICULA NEARLY TOUCHING EACH OTHER AMIDST THESE FASCICULI WE FIND THE LARGE STOUT FORMS IMBEDDED THE WHOLE OF THEM APPARENTLY HAVING BEEN COMPLETELY ENVELOPED BY THE SARCODE OF THE SPONGE CYLINDRORECTANGULATED HEXRADIATE APICALLY SPINED PLATE XXV FIG 35THIS FORM IS VERY ABUNDANT IN AN UNDESCRIBED SPECIES OF EUPLECTELLA IN THE MUSEUM OF THE JARDIN DES PLANTES PARIS THE FIGURE REPRESENTS THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SPICULUM ONLY THE LOWER PORTION OF THE AXIAL SHAFT BEING EXCEEDINGLY ELONGATED WHEN EXAMINED WITH A POWER OF 400 LINEAR THE APICES OF THE RADII ARE SEEN TO BE ABUNDANTLY BUT MINUTELY SPINED THE AXIAL SHAFT OF THIS SPICULUM WITHOUT ANY OF THE LATERAL RADII DEVELOPED IS ALSO ABUNDANT IT IS EXCEEDINGLY LONG AND AT THE PROPER DISTANCE BELOW THE APEX WE OFTEN OBSERVE A GRADUAL ENLARGEMENT OF THE DIAMETER AS REPRESENTED IN FIG 37 AND THE RUDIMENTARY CANALS FOR THE LATERAL RADII ARE FREQUENTLY APPARENT THIS FORM OF SPICULUM IS ALSO VERY ABUNDANT IN DACTYLOCALYX PUMICEA STUTCHBURY IPHITEON OF THE FRENCH MUSEUM IN GENERAL CHARACTER THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE EAPLECTELLA DESCRIBED ABOVE WITH THE ADDITION OF THE APICES OF THE RADII BEING MORE OR LESS CLAVATEDAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADA 311 ALL THE SIMPLE RECTANGULATED HEXRADIATE FORMS OF SPICULA HITHERTO DESCRIBED ARE LARGE COMPARED WITH THE RECTANGULATED HEXRADIATE SPICULA WHICH FORM THE CENTRAL BASES OF THE COMPOUND STELLATE FORMS AND EXCEPTING THE DISPARITY IN SIZE THE TRANSITION FROM THE LAST FORM DESCRIBED TO THE COMPLICATED AND BEAUTIFUL COMPOUND STELLATE ONES IS EASY AND NATURAL THE APICES OF THE HEXRADIATE FORM BECOMING THE BASES OF THE NUMEROUS RADII OF THE STELLATE ONES THIS TRANSITION FROM THE SIMPLE TO THE COMPOUND FORMS IS ADMIRABLY ILLUSTRATED IN A BIFURCATED SPICULUM THAT OCCURS IN THE NEW SPECIES OF EUPLECTELLA IN THE MUSEUM OF THE JARDIN DES PLANTES WHICH I PROPOSE TO DESIGNATE AS FOLLOWS BIFURCATED RECTANGULATED HEXRADIATE STELLATE PLATE XXV FIG 38IT IS MINUTE AND SLENDER AND THE BIFURCATING RAYS ARE IRREGULAR OFTEN TORTUOUS AND ARE FREQUENTLY NOT PRODUCED ON ONE OR TWO OF THE PRIMARY RADII THESE INDECISIVE CHARACTERS COMMON TO ALL THE SPECIMENS OF THIS FORM OF SPICULUM THAT I HAVE SEEN COMBINED WITH THE ELONGATE CHARACTERS OF THE RADII SEEM STRONGLY TO MARK THIS SPICULUM AS THE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE SIMPLE HEXRADIATE AND THE COMPOUND STELLATE FORMS OF SPICULA TRIFURCATOHEXRADIATE STELLATE PLATE XXV FIG 39THE CENTRAL RADII CONSIST OF SIX RECTANGULATED PRIMARY RAYS OF EQUAL LENGTH EACH OF WHICH TERMINATES IN THREE EQUIDISTANT SECONDARY ATTENUATING RAYS WHICH ARE PROJECTED FROM THE APICES OF THE PRIMARY ONES AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 45 DEGREES TO THE COMMON BASAL OR PRIMARY RAY THESE SPICULA OCCUR IN ABUNDANCE IN EULPLECTELLA ASPERGILLWM OWEN AND IN DACTYLOCALYX PYRNICECT STUTCHBURY I OBSERVED THEM FIRST IN SOME FRAGMENTS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SPECIMEN OF B JYAMICEA HALF OF WHICH IS IN THE POSSESSION OF DR J E GRAY AND THE OTHER HALF IS I BELIEVE IN THE MUSEUM OF THE BRISTOL INSTITUTION AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN A SECOND SPECIMEN IN THE POSSESSION OF MY FRIEND MR THOMAS INGALL IN WHOSE SPONGE THERE ARE REMAINS OF THE SARCODOUS STRUCTURE WHICH IS LITERALLY CROWDED WITH THEM AND THE SPINULOHEXRADIATE STELLATE ONES THEY ARE ALSO ABUNDANT IN A SPECIMEN OF I BELIEVE A DIFFERENT SPECIES IN THE MUSEUM OF THE JARDIN DES PLANTES AT PARIS WHERE THE SPONGE IS DESIGNATED IPLITEON THERE IS A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN THE FORM AND MODE OF RADIATION OF THE SECONDARY RAYS IN THE SPECIMENS OF THESE SPICULA THAT OCCUR IN MR CUMINGS BEAUTIFUL SPECIMEN OF EUPLECTELLA ASPERGILLUM AND THOSE FROM DACTYLOCALYX AND THEY ARE NOT IN THE FORMER SPECIES ACCOMPANIED BY THE SPINULOHEXRADIATE ONES AS IN DACTYLOCALYX JTNUMICEA IN MY FRIEND DR A FARRES BEAUTIFUL SPECIMEN OF EWPLECTELLA THEY ARE TO BE FOUND BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS IN MR CUMINGS SPONGE BUT THEY ARE OF PRECISELY THE SAME FORM AS THE SPICULA FROM THAT SPECIMEN SPINULOTRIFURCATED HEXRADIATE STELLATE PLATE XXVI FIG 1THE CENTRAL RADII CONSIST OF SIX RECTANGULAR PRIMARY RAYS OF EQUAL LENGTH EACH OF WHICH TERMINATES IN THREE EQUIDISTANT CYLINDROSPINULATE RADII PROJECTED FROM THE APICES OF THE PRIMARY ONES AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 45 DEGREES TO THE AXIS OF THE COMMON BASAL PRIMARY RAY OCCASIONALLY WE FIND FOUR SECONDARY RADII IN PLACE OF THREE BUT THIS IS NOT OF COMMON OCCURRENCE AND IN THE FULLY DEVELOPED SPICULA THE SPINULATE TERMINATIONS ARE USUALLY NOT GLOBULAR BUT OF A MORE OR LESS DEPRESSED FORM THIS SPICULUM I HAVE FOUND ONLY IN 3MDCCCLVIII 2 U312 DR J S BOWERBANK ON TIL ANATOMY DACTYLOCALY PUMICEA INTERMINGLED WITH THE TRIFURCATOATTENUATOHEXRADIATE SPICULA AND IT APPEARS TO BE EVEN MORE ABUNDANT THAN THE LASTNAMED FORM SPINULOQUADRIFURCATE HEXRADIATE STELLATE PLATE XXVI FIG 2A RECTANGULATED HEXRADIATE SPICULUM HAVING EACH PRIMARY RAY TERMINATING IN FOUR NEARLY EQUIDISTANT CYLINDROSPINULATE SECONDARY RADII THESE SPICULA OCCUR ABUNDANTLY IN A BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE SPECIMEN OF A CUPSHAPED SILICEOFIBROUS SPONGE IN THE CABINET OF MY FRIEND MR THOMAS INGALL THE REMAINS OF THE SARCODE ARE CROWDED WITH THEM IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION THE SPECIMEN REPRESENITED BY FIGURE 2 HAS HAD THREE OF ITS PRIMARY RADII BROKEN OFF NEAR THEIR COMMON BASE THUS ENABLING US TO SEE DISTINCTLY THE STRUCTURE OF THIS CURIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL FORM OF SPICULUM FLORICOMOHEXRADIATE PLATE XXVI FIGS 3 AND 4THE CENTRAL RADII CONSIST OF SIX RECTANGULATED PRIMARY RAYS OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH SLIGHTLY EXPANDED TERMINATIONS FROM EACH OF WHICH THERE ISSUE SEVEN OR MORE PETALOID SECONDARY SPICULA THE WHOLE FORMING ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SIMULATIONS OF A FLOWER IMAGINABLE EACH PETALOID SPICULUM IS SLENDER AT ITS PROXIMAL TERMINATION AND CONTINUES TO BE SO UNTIL NEAR ITS DISTAL END WHERE IT EXPANDS LATERALLY AND PRESENTS A NEARLY SEMICIRCULAR CONCAVOCONVEX TERMINATION WITH A BEAUTIFUL DENTATE MARGIN THE NUMBER OF THE DENTS BEING USUALLY SEVEN EACH OF THE PETALOID SPICULA CURVES GENTLY OUTWARD FROM ITS BASE THE FLOWING LINE RETURNING TOWARDS THE CENTRAL AXIS OF THE FLOWER AT ABOUT HALF OF ITS HEIGHT FROM THE BASE AND THEN IT AGAIN CURVES OUTWARD UNTIL THE APICAL EXPANSION IS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE FLORAL AXIS SO THAT THE WHOLE RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A FORM LIKE THAT OF THE FLOWER OF A JASMIN THE BEAUTIFUL TERMINAL PETALOID EXPANSIONS WITH THEIR REGU LARLY DISPOSED MARGINAL DENTS RENDERS THE ILLUSION COMPLETE THE UNITED BASAL CURVES LOOKING AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PRODUCED BY THE SWELLING OVARIUM OF A FLOWER I HAVE OBTAINED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF THESE ELEGANT SPICULA FROM MY FRIEND MR CUMINGS BEAUTIFUL SPECIMEN OF EUPLECTELLA ASPERGILLUMN WHICH WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED LIBERALITY HE PLACED AT MY DISPOSAL FOR EXAMINATION THEY ARE FOUND ALSO IN DR A FARRES SPECIMEN OF EMPLECTELLA AGREEING IN EVERY RESPECT WITH THOSE FROM MR CUMINGS SPONGE CORONATOHEXRADIATE STELLATE PLATE XXVI FIG 5THE CENTRAL RADII CONSIST OF SIX RECTANGULATED PRIMARY RAYS OF EQUAL LENGTH EACH TERMINATING IN A DISCOID EXPANSION THE MARGIN OF WHICH IS FURNISHED WITH NUMEROUS CURVED PETALOID RADII I OBTAINED THIS BEAUTIFUL BUT VERY MINUTE SPICULUM THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF PROFESSORS MILNEEDWARDS AND VALENCIENNES FROM A SPECIMEN OF EUPLECTELLA IN THE MUSEUM OF THE JARDIN DES PLANTES PARIS IN WHICH THERE ARE TWO OF THESE BEAUTIFUL SPONGES ONE BEING IN A MUCH BETTER STATE OF PRESERVATION THAN THE OTHER AND IN THE MUTILATED SPECI MEN THIS BEAUTIFUL FORM WAS FOUND THE SPICULUM IS EVIDENTLY NOT IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION AS THERE ARE ONLY FOUR RAYS OUT OF THE SIX PRESENT BUT AT THE CENTRE OF THE SPICULUM THERE IS THE INDICATION OF THE FORMER EXISTENCE OF ONE OF THE TWO MISSING RADII THE CORONAL TERMINATIONS ARE VERYAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADM 313 LIKE THE RECEPTACLE OF THE GREAT COMMON HELIANTHUS OR SUNFLOWER AND THE MARGINAL RADII RESEMBLE THE PETALS OF THE SAME FLOWER BUT ARE SOMEWHAT LONGER IN THEIR PROPOR TIONS THE SPICULUM IS VERY MINUTE THE EXTREME DIAMETER MEASURING 1Y  OF AN INCH AND THE DIAMETER

CONCAVOCONVEX DISC OR CUP THE CONVEX SURFACE BEING OUTWARD I FOUND THIS EXTREMELY MINUTE FORM ENTANGLED IN THE TISSUES OF A SPECIMEN OF HALI CHONDRIA INCRUSTANS DREDGED UP BY MY FRIEND MR ICANDREW AT THE ORKNEY ISLANDS AND IT IS PROBABLY FROM ONE OF THE SMALL SPECIES OF EUMLECTELLA THAT ARE FOUND IN THE NORTH SEA THE SPECIMEN HAS SHIFTED IN THE SLIDE IN WHICH IT IS MOUNTED INTO SO OBLIQUE A POSI TION THAT THE ACCURACY OF THE SIZE ONLY CAN BE DEPENDED UPON BUT WHEN FIRST OBSERVED IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT WAS MOUNTED I OBTAINED A VERY SATISFACTORY VIEW OF ITS STRUCTURE AND MADE A ROUGH SKETCH OF IT AT THE TIME AND FROM THIS AND FROM ITS PROJECTION BY THE CAMERA LUCIDA AT THE PRESENT PERIOD THE DRAWING OF IT HAS BEEN MADE THERE ARE FOUR ONLY OF THE RADII REMAINING AND ITS HEXRADIATE FORM IS THEREFORE ONLY SURMISED ON THE STRENGTH OF ITS AFFINITY TO MORE PERFECT SPECIMENS OF THAT TYPE OF FORM IT IS THE MOST MINUTE SPICULUM OF THIS DESCRIPTION THAT I HAVE SEEN THE EXTREME DIAMETER OF THE DISTAL ENDS OF THE OPPOSITE RADII MEASURED ONLY IJ14 OF AN INCH BESIDE THE STELLATE AND HEXRADIATE FORMS OF SPICULA THERE ARE A FEW OTHERS FOUND IN THE SARCODE WHICH DO NOT APPEAR TO BE CONSTRUCTIVELY CONNECTED WITH EITHER OF THOSE GROUPS ATTENUATORECTANGULATED TRIRADIATE APICALJY SPINED PLATE XXVI FIG 7THIS FORM IS NOT AS IT MIGHT BE HASTILY SURMISED THE TRIRADIATE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF A HEXRADIATE SPICULUM IT IS LARGER IN EVERY RESPECT THAN THE SLENDER VARIETY OF THE HEX RADIATE FORM AND LESS STOUT BUT MUCH LONGER THAN THE STOUT VARIETY OF THE HEXRADIATE FORM PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED AND ALTHOUGH INTERMINGLED WITH THEM AND THE OTHER FORMS OF SPICULA IN ENPLECTELLA ASPERQILLUM IT IS ALWAYS READILY TO BE DISTINGUISHED BY AN EXPERIENCED OBSERVER THE SPINES ARE SMALL BUT THICKLY DISPERSED

PRECISELY THAT OF FIG 7 PLATE XXVI EXCEPTING THAT THE RADII ARE CYLINDRICAL INSTEAD OF ATTENUATED SPICULATED BITERNATE PLATE XXVI FIGS 8 AND 9I FOUND SEVERAL OF THESE SPICULA IN THE DUST SHAKEN FROM THE SILICEOFIBROUS MASSIVE SPONGE AT THE BASE OF MY FRIEND DR A FARRIES SPECIMEN OF ETPLECTELLA CITWURNER OWEN AND I HAVE NO DOUBT OF THEIR BELONGING TO THE SARCODE OF THE SPONGE AT ITS BASE THEY

BIFURCATED RADII THAT I HAVE YET SEEN THEY VARY ALSO CONSIDERABLY IN SIZE THE SIMPLER OF THE TWO FORMS FIGURE 8 BEING MUCH LARGER THAN THAT REPRESENTED BY FIGURE 9 MULTIANGULATED CYLINDRICAL PLATE XXVI FIG 10THIS SINGULAR LITTLE FORM OF SPICULUM OCCURS ABUNDANTLY IN THE SARCODE OF GEODIA CARINATA BOWERBANK MS IT IS ANGULATED ALTERNATELY IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AT REGULAR DISTANCES FROM TWO TO SIX OR SEVEN TIMES IT IS EXTREMELY MINUTE A FULLSIZED FIVEANGLED ONE MEASURING IN LENGTH L14TH OF AN INCH AND DIAMETER OF SHAFT L 666TH OF AN INCH IT IS DIFFICULT TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS BELONGING TO THE MEMBRANES BUT ITS EXTREME MINUTENESS IS NOT IN FAVOUR OF THAT SUPPOSITION AND IN CAREFULLY FOCUSING THE SPECIMENS OF THE SPICULA IN SITU NO TWO APPEAR TO BE IMBEDDED IN THE SAME PLANE ABOVE THE INTER STITIAL MEMBRANES WHERE THEY ARE TO BE OBSERVED BEST I HAVE THEREFORE CONSIDERED IT AS BELONGING TO THE SARCODOUS RATHER THAN TO THE MEMBRANOUS STRUCTURES SPICULA OF THE GEMMULES THE SPICULA APPROPRIATED TO THE GEMMULES OF SPONGES OCCUR IN VARIOUS MODES OF DISPOSITION 1ST THEY ARE IMBEDDED IRREGULARLY IN AN EXTERNAL ENVELOPE OF THE GEMMULE OR ON THE SURFACE OF THE

IN FASCICULI IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE GEMMULE FROM THE CENTRE TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE IN THE FIRST MODE OF DISPOSITION THEY ARE SOMETIMES OF THE SAME FORM AS THOSE OF THE SKELETON BUT CONSIDERABLY LESS BOTH IN LENGTH AND DIAMETER TO ADAPT THEM TO THE OFFICE THEY HAVE TO PERFORM IN OTHER CASES THEY DIFFER MATERIALLY IN BOTH SIZE AND FORM FROM THOSE OF THE SURROUNDING SKELETON BUT IN EVERY CASE WITH WHICH I AM ACQUAINTED THEIR LONG AXES ARE PARALLEL TO THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE CASE OF THE GEMMULE OR TO THE SURFACE OF THE GEMMULE ITSELF IN THE SECOND MODE OF DISPOSITION THEY ARE IMMERSED IN THE COMPARATIVELY THICK CRUST OF THE GEMMULE THEIR LONG AXES BEING ALWAYS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO LINES RADIATING FROM ITS CENTRE TO ITS CIRCUMFERENCE THEIR FORMS BECOME WIDELY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE

THICK CORIACEOUS COAT OF THE GEMMULE THAT THEY ARE PERFECTLY INVISIBLE UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND IT IS ONLY AFTER THE GEMMULE HAS BEEN BOILED IN NITRIC ACID FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD THAT IT IS RENDERED SUFFICIENTLY TRANSPARENT TO ALLOW OF THE SPICULA BEING SEEN IN SITU THE PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE FORMS OF SPICULA IS VERY BEAUTIFULLY EXHIBITED IN THE SPICULA FROM THE GEMMULES OF SPONGILLA PLUMOSA CARTER WE FIRST OBSERVE THEMAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADL 317 WITH A LINEAR POWER OF 660 IN THE SHAPE OF SLENDER SMOOTH CYLINDRICAL SPICULA WITH A SLIGHT ENLARGEMENT AT EACH TERMINATION AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST INDICATION OF SPINES ON THE SHAFT AND IN THIS CONDITION THE CENTRAL CAVITY IS LARGE OCCUPYING ABOUT ONE THIRD OF ITS DIAMETER PLATE XXVI FIG 18 IN THE SECOND STAGE THE ONLY ALTERATION IN ITS FORM IS AN ENLARGEMENT OF THE TERMINATIONS THE EDGES ASSUMING AN ANGULAR SHAPE AND A FEW SLENDER SPINES ARE OBSERVABLE PLATE XXVI FIG 19 IN THE THIRD STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THE TERMINATIONS ASSUME THE FORM OF DISTINCT CIRCULAR PLATES OR INCIPIENT ROTULKE THE MARGINS OF WHICH ARE SLIGHTLY CRENATE THE SHAFT EXHIBITS NUMEROUS LONG SLENDER SPINES AND THE CENTRAL CAVITY NOW DOES NOT OCCUPY MORE THAN ONEFIFTH OF THE DIAMETER OF THE SPICULUM PLATE XXVI FIG 20 FROM THIS FORM SPECIMENS IN EVERY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT MAY BE READILY TRACED UNTIL THE STRONGLY SPINOUS MARGIN THE PRO MINENT CONVEXITY OF THE ROTULAE AND THE ROBUST SHAFT WITH ITS LONG CONICAL SPINES INDI CATE THE COMPLETELY ADULT CONDITION OF THE SPICULUM AND IN THIS STATE THE CENTRAL CAVITY CAN VERY RARELY BE SEEN PLATE XXVI FIG 21 THE GROWTH OF THESE SPICULA IN THEIR EARLY STAGES IS PROBABLY VERY RAPID AS THE NUM BER OF THOSE IN THE FIRST AND SECOND STAGES IS REMARKABLY SMALL AS COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE THIRD AND SUBSEQUENT STAGES IN THE INEQUIBIROTULATE SPICULA OF SPONGILLA PAULTLA BOWERBANK MS WE FIND A NUMBER OF RADIAL CANALS PASSING FROM EACH END OF THE CENTRAL CAVITY OF THE SHAFT TO THE EXTREME CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE ROTULE AND IT IS THEREFORE PROBABLE THAT THIS EXPANDED PART OF THE SPICULUM IS SIMILAR IN CHARACTER TO THAT OF THE FOLIOPELTATE SPICULUM WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED PAGE 299 IN TREATING OF THE SPICULA OF THE MEMBRANES AND THAT THEY ARE IN FACT ORIGINALLY COMPOSED OF A SERIES OF TERMINAL RADIAL SPICULA EXPANDING AND COALESCING LATERALLY AND THUS FORMING ONE PLANE

THE CONGENEROUS FORM IN S ONGILLALVIATILIS INASMUCH AS THE SPINATION OF THE SHAFT IN SP MEYENI IS THE RULE WHILE IN SP FILVIATILIS IT IS A RARE EXCEPTION RECURVODENTATE BIROTULATE PLATE XXVI FIGS 21 AND 22THIS ELEGANT FORM OF SPICULUM IS FROM THE COAT OF THE GEMMULE OF SPONGILLA PAIRNOSA CARTER FROM THE WATER TANKS OF BOMBAY IT IS THE MOST PERFECTLY DEVELOPED FORM OF ITS CLASS WITH WHICH WE ARE ACQUAINTED IT VARIES TO SOME EXTENT IN SIZE AND FORM THE LENGTH OF THE SHAFT IS FROM THREE TO THREEANDAHALF TIMES THE DIAMETER OF THE ROTULKE AND IT IS COVERED PRO FUSELY WITH STOUT ACUTELYCONICAL SPINES WHICH FREQUENTLY EXCEED THE DIAMETER OF THE SHAFT IN LENGTH THE ROTULN ARE INTERNALLY CONCAVE AND CONSIDERABLY AND REGULARLY CONVEX ON THE OUTER SURFACE AND THEY HAVE THEIR MARGINS IRREGULARLY DENTATE THE DENTS IN FULLYDEVELOPED SPECIMENS BEING MUCH RECURVED THE SHAFT IS USUALLY REGULARLY CYLINDRICAL THROUGHOUT ITS LENGTH BUT IN VERY FULLYDEVELOPED SPICULA IT SOMETIMES INCREASES CONSIDERABLY IN ITS DIAMETER AT A SLIGHT DISTANCE FROM ITS JUNCTIONS WITH THE ROTUKE IN THIS SPICULUM AS IT OCCURS IN SPONGILLA PLUMOSA CARTER THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIROTULATE FORM IS

SINGULAR FORM OF SPICULUM IS FROM THE OUTER PORTION OF THE GEMMULES OF A NEW SPECIES OF FRESHWATER SPONGE FROM THE RIVER AMAZON SPONGILLA RECURVATA BOWERBANIK MS THE EXTERNAL SURFACES OF THE ROTULHE ARE SMOOTH VERY CONVEX AND IN MANY CASES ALMOST HEMISPHERICAL SO THAT THE POINTS OF THE CURVED SPINES ARE IN THE DIRECTION OF LINES PARALLEL TO THE SHAFT OF THE SPICULUM AND THE ROTULE ARE CLEFT

IMME DIATELY BENEATH THE OUTER MEMBRANE OF THE GEMMULE OF A NEW SPECIES OF FRESHWATER SPONGE FROM THE RIVER AMAZON SPONGILLA BROWNII BOWERBANK MS THE FORM IS TRULY THAT OF A LITTLE SHIELD THE LOWER SURFACE BEING CONCAVE WHILE THE UPPER ONE HAS A CORRESPONDING DEGREE OF CONVEXITY AND THE UMBO PROJECTS FROM ITS CENTRE IN THE SHAPE OF A SMALL CONE THE DIAMETER OF AN AVERAGESIZED ONE IS 19JATH OF AN INCH AND THE HEIGHT VERY NEARLY EQUALLED THE DIAMETER INEQUIJTRIROTULATE PLATE XXVI FIG 38HAVING TWO TERMINAL ROTULAE OF EQUAL SIZE AND ONE INTERMEDIATE OF GREATER DIAMETER THAN THE TERMINAL ONES I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPONGE FROM WHICH THIS SPICULUM IS DERIVED NOR IN TRUTH WHETHER IT BE FROM A SPONGE I FOUND TWO OF THEM AMONG A GREAT VARIETY OF SPONGE SPICULA PROCURED BY WASHING SOME SPECIMENS OF OCULINA ROSEA FROM THE SOUTH SEA THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE SPICULUM IS THE SAME AS THAT OF A BIROTULATE ONE FROM A SPON GILLA AND THE ROTULAE EXHIBIT RATHER INDISTINCTLY THE SAME DESCRIPTION OF RADIAL CANALS THAT ARE SO DISTINCTLY PORTRAYED IN PLATE XXVI FIG 32 IT MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN DISENGAGED BY DECOMPOSITION FROM THE GEMMULE OF SOME UNKNOWN SPECIES OF SPONGILLA BROUGHT

THE SURFACE OF THE GEMMULES OF TETHEA CRANIUM JOHNSTON THE LARGEST DIAMETER OF THE SPICULUM IS AT ABOUT ONE FOURTH OR ONEFIFTH OF ITS LENGTH FROM ITS BASE AND THENCE IT GRADUALLY DIMINISHES IN SIZE TO THE VERY ATTENUATED APEX THEY ARE ABOUT LTH OF AN INCH IN LENGTH UNIHAMATE ATTENUATOCLAVATE PLATE XXVI FIG 40THIS SINGULAR FORM OCCURS ABUNDANTLY IN THE GEMMULES OF TETHEA CRANIUM JOHNSTON THE LONG ATTENUATED SHAFT INCREASES GRADUALLY IN SIZE FROM ITS PROXIMAL END TO ITS DISTAL ONE WHERE IT RAPIDLY BUT PROGRESSIVELY INCREASES IN DIAMETER AND TERMINATES HEMISPHERICALLY FROM THIS CLAVATE MASS A SINGLE HOOK IS PROJECTED WHICH CURVES SLIGHTLY TOWARDS THE SHAFT OF THE SPICULUM SO THAT ITS APEX REACHES A POINT AT ABOUT 450 FROM THE AXIS OF THE SPICULUM THE LENGTH OF THE HOOK IS ABOUT EQUAL TO THE DIAMETER OF THE CLAVATE MASS FROM WHICH IT EMANATES I HAVE SEEN A GREAT NUMBER OF SPICULA OF THIS FORM FROM DIFFERENT SPECIMENS OF TETHEA CRANIUM AND NEVER FOUND MORE THAN ONE TERMINAL HOOK BUT IT APPEARS HIGHLY PROBABLE FROM A COMPARISON OF THESE SPICULA WITH ALLIED FORMS FROM THE GEMMULES OF ZETHEA SIMILIMUS BOWERBANI MS FROM THE SOUTH SEA IN THE MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS THAT IT IS BUT A PERMANENT VARIETY OF THE RECURVOTERNATE FORM THAT OCCURS SPARINGLY AMONG THE DEFENSIVE SPICULA OF T CRANIUM ATTENUATORECURVOTERNATE PLATE XXVI FIGS 41 AND 42IN THE GEMMULES OF TETHEA STMILIMUS BOWERBANK MS FROM THE SOUTH SEA THERE ARE NUMEROUS SPICULA LIKE THOSE REPRESENTED BY FIGURE 40 FROM T CRANIUM BUT NOT QUITE SO MUCH RECURVED AND MANY OF THESE HAVE THE RUDIMENTARY CANAL OPPOSITE TO THE WELLDEVELOPED HOOK INDICATING A PREDISPOSITION TO ELIMINATE A SECOND ONE IN OTHER SPICULA WE FIND THE SECOND HOOK FULLY PRODUCED AS REPRESENTED BY FIGURE 41 AND OCCASIONALLY THOUGH RARELY WE FIND A COMPLETELY TERNATE TERMINATION AS REPRESENTED BY FIGURE 42 ATTENUATOPORRECTOTERNATE PLATE XXVI FIG 43THIS FORM IS FOUND IN ABUN DANCE IN THE FASCICULI OF SPICULA IN THE GEMMULE OF TETHEA CRANIUM JOHNSTON IT IS VERY LIKE THE PORRECTOTERNATE SPICULA THAT ARE PROJECTED FROM THE SURFACE OF THAT SPONGE BUT IT DIFFERS FROM THEM IN ALWAYS HAVING THE RADII EXPANDED TO A GREATER AMOUNT IN MANY CASES ATTAINING AN ANGLE OF NEARLY 40 DEGREES TO THE SHAFT OF THE SPICULUM THE TERNATE TERMINATION IS ALWAYS THE DISTAL ONE THE POSITIONS IN THE SPONGE OF THE WHOLE OF THE SPICULA HITHERTO FIGURED HAVE BEEN DETERMINED WITH AS GREAT A DEGREE OF ACCURACY AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED BESIDE THESE THERE ARE OTHER INTERESTING FORMS OF SPICULA OF THE SPONGEOUS ORIGIN OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO REASONABLE DOUBT WHICH HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES DURING THE COURSE OF MY RESEARCHES AND WHICH I HAVE THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO DESCRIBE SEPARATELYAND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SPONGIADE 321 ICULA THE POSITION OF WHICH ARE UNKNOWN BIRECURVTOQUATERNATE MEDIALLY SPINED PLATE XXVI FIG 44THIS SPICULUM IS FIGURED AND DESCRIBED BY MY FRIEND PROF QUEKETT IN THE  CATALOGUE OF THE HISTOLOGICAL SERIES IN THE MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS PLATE 11 FIG 9 B P 187 A P 46 AS A RECURVOTERNATE FORM BUT A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THREE SPECIMENS FOR WHICH I AM INDEBTED TO HIM HAS SATISFIED ME THAT THE TERMINATIONS ARE QUATERNATE THE TWO ENDS OF THE SPICULUM DIFFER CONSIDERABLY IN STRUCTURE AT ONE TERMINATION THERE IS LITTLE OR NO ENLARGEMENT OF THE SHAFT AND THE HOOKS ARE PROJECTED SOMEWHAT UPWARD AS WELL AS OUTWARD AND ARE SO CURVED THAT EACH FORMS NEARLY A SEMICIRCLE WHILE THOSE AT THE OPPOSITE END EACH CURVES DOWNWARD FROM ITS BASE TO ITS APEX DESCRIBING NOT MORE THAN THE FOURTH PART OF A CIRCLE AND THIS END OF THE SPICULUM HAS THE SHAFT STRONGER AND MORE CLAVATE THAN THE OTHER THE SPINES ON THE SHAFT ARE MORE OR LESS CURVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOOKS OF THE LARGER END FROM THESE CHARACTERS I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE SPICULUM IS AN INTERNAL DEFENSIVE ONE AND THAT THE SMALLER END THE LEAST RECURVED IS THE BASAL ONE THE TWO PERFECT SPICULA IN MY POSSESSION WERE AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE OF THE SAME SIZE TLWTH OF AN INCH IN LENGTH IT WAS OBTAINED FROM SOME SPONGEOUS MAT TER TAKEN FROM THE BASE OF A LARGE CUPSHAPED SPONGE IN THE MUSEUM AT EDINBURGH TUBERCULATED

BY MY FRIENDS MESSRS MATTHEW MAR SHALL LEGG AND INGALL BUT THE SPONGE WHENCE IT IS MOST PROBABLY DERIVED HAS NEVER YET BEEN DETERMINED IT IS REMARKABLE AS BEING THE ONLY WELLDEFINED AND PERFECT SILI CEOUS SPICULUM THAT HAS YET BEEN OBSERVED TO POSSESS THE SHORT STOUT TUBERCLES THAT ARE SO CHARACTERISTIC OF ITS STRUCTURE FRAGMENTS OF TWO OTHER SPICULA POSSESSING SIMILAR CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY ME AND ARE REPRESENTED BY FIGURES 46 AND 47 INL THE SPECIMEN REPRESENTED BY FIGURE 46 THE TUBERCLES ARE LESS IN NUMBER BUT ARE CONSIDERABLY MORE PRODUCED AND THEIR TERMINATIONS ARE MORE ABRUPTLY TRUNCATED IN THE SPICULUM REPRESENTED BY FIGURE 47 THEY ARE STILL MORE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED ARE SHORTER AND MORE INCLINED TO BE CONICAL SO THAT THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THEY HAVE BELONGED TO THREE DISTINCT SPECIES OF SPONGE BUT IN ALL THREE OF THEM THERE IS ONE PECULIARITY THAT OF THE MANNER OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE TUBERCLES ON THE SHAFTS OF THE SPICULA WHERE WE OBSERVE THEM TO BE DISPOSED IN MORE OR LESS REGULAR LONGITUDINAL LINES AND THAT THE TUBERCLES FORMING EACH LINE ALTERNATE WITH THOSE OF THE LINE NEXT TO THEM SO THAT THEY ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF A SPIRAL ARRANGEMENT THE CLOSE ALLIANCE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THESE SPICULA WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF A PECULIAR TRIBE OF SPONGES WITH WHICH WE ARE AT PRESENT ENTIRELY UNACQUAINTED ACERATE VERTICILLATELY SPINED PLATE XXVI FIG 48I OBTAINED THIS SINGULAR FORM FROM A PARASITICAL SPONGE FROM WESTERN AUSTRALIA THIS CURIOUS SPONGE IN THE FORMATION OF ITS SKELETON APPEARS TO HAVE APPROPRIATED THE SPICULA OF

ROSEA BY A DEALER IN THE PROCESS OF CLEANING THE CORAL IT IS NOT A MALFORMATION AS THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THEM IN THE SAME SLIDE AND THEY ARE ALL ANGULATED TO THE SAME EXTENT IT IS PROBABLY AN INTERNAL

BE FROM ASH ISLAND NEW SOUTH WALES WHEN WELLDEVELOPED BOTH THE TERMINATIONS OF THE CYLINDRICAL SHAFT ARE MORE OR LESS SPINULATE AND ONE OR BOTH OF THE ENDS OF THE SHAFT ARE INCIPIENTLY SPINOUS THE NEAREST FORM TO THIS SPICULUM IS THE ARCUATE ONE THAT IS FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE GEMMULE OF SPONGILLA LACUSTRIS JOHNSTON AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS ONE IS ALSO FROM A SPONGE OF THAT GENUS AS I

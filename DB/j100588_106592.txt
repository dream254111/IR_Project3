THIS SUBSTANCE WAS GOT OUT OF A LEADMINE AT ALSTON MOOR IN CUMBERLAND I FIRST SAW IT IN THE VALUABLE COLLECTION OF MY WORTHY AND INGENIOUS FRIEND MATTHEW BOULTON ESQ AT SOHO WHO WHEN HE PICKED IT UP CON JECTURED FROM ITS WEIGHT THAT IT CONTAINED SOMETHING METALLIC ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I SAW IT IN HIS POSSESSION AND PARTLY FROM ITS APPEARANCE BEING DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ANY CALCAREOUS SPAR I HAD SEEN AND PARTLY FROM ITS GREAT WEIGHT I SUSPECTED IT TO BE THE SPATUM PONDEROSUM A FEW EXPERIMENTS MADE AT THE MOMENT CONFIRMED MY SUS PICIONS AT LEAST SO FAR AS TO SHEW THAT IT CONTAINED A LARGE PRO PORTION OF THE TERRA PONDEROSA UNITED TO FIXED AIR BUT I DID NOT THEN FLATTER MYSELF THAT IT WOULD PROVE SO PURE AS I AFTERWARDS FOUND IT TO BE PROFESSOR294 DR WITHERINGS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS PROFESSOR BERGMAN IN HIS SCIAGRAPHIA REGNI MINERALIS PUBLISHED LAST YEAR AT LEIPSIC CONJECTURES  58 WITH HIS USUAL SAGACITY  TERRA PONDEROSA NITRATA FORTE ALICUBI NATIVA  OCCURRIT A NEMINE TAMEN ADHUC INVENTA QUOD ETIAM VALET  DE AERATA I WAS MUCH DELIGHTED BY THE DETECTION OF A SUBSTANCE WHICH PROMISES TO BE OF VERY CONSIDERABLE UTILITY IN CHEMICAL INQUIRIES AND MORE SO WHEN I FOUND IT TO BE A NATIVE OF THIS COUNTRY FOR IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT IT MAY BE MET WITH IN MANY OTHER MINES BESIDES THAT AT ALSTONMOOR MR BOULTON WITH HIS USUAL BENEVOLENCE PRESENTED ME WITH A PIECE OF IT PART OF WHICH ACCOMPANIES THIS PAPER FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY MORE OBVIOUS PROPERTIES ITS GENERAL APPEARANCE IS NOT MUCH UNLIKE THAT OF A LUMP OF ALUM BUT UPON CLOSER INSPECTION IT SEEMS TO BE COMPOSED OF SLENDER SPICULAE IN CLOSE CONTACT BUT MORE OR LESS DIVERGING IT MAY BE CUT WITH A KNIFE ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS FROM 4300 TO 4338 IT EFFERVESCES WITH ACIDS AND MELTS UNDER THE BLOWPIPE THOUGH NOT VERY READILY PLACED IN A COVERED CRUCIBLE IN A HOT PARLOUR FIRE IT LOST ITS TRANSPARENCY AFTER EXPOSURE TO A MODERATE HEAT IN A MELTING FURNANCE IT ADHERED TO THE CRUCIBLE AND EXHIBITED SIGNS OF FUSION BUT WAS NOT DIMINISHED IN WEIGHT DID NOT FEEL CAUSTIC WHEN AP PLIED TO THE TONGUE NOR HAD IT LOST ITS PROPERTY OF EFFERVESCING WITH ACIDS HENCEON THE TERRA PONDEROSA C 295 HENCE IT IS PROBABLE THAT ITS LOSS OF TRANSPARENCY WAS RATHER OCCASIONED BY NUMEROUS SMALL CRACKS THAN BY ANY ESCAPE OF THE WATER OF CRYSTALLIZATION OR OF ITS AERIAL ACID E X P E R I M E N T S A 500 GRAINS DISSOLVED IN MURIATIC ACID IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NOTHING BUT ELASTIC FLUID COULD ESCAPE LOST IN SOLUTION 104 GRAINS AND THERE REMAINED AN INSOLUBLE RESIDUUM OF NEARLY 3 GRAINS 2 IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT 100 GRAINS LOST IN SOLUTION 21 GRAINS AND THERE REMAINED 06 OF A GRAIN OF INSOLUBLE MATTER B 100 GRAINS DISSOLVING IN DILUTE MURIATIC ACID GAVE OUT 25 OUNCE MEASURES OF AIR THIS AIR WAS RECEIVED IN QUICKSILVER AND WHEN THE SPAR WAS WHOLLY DISSOLVED THE SOLUTION WAS BOILED IN ORDER TO DRIVE OUT WHAT AIR MIGHT BE LODGED IN IT 2 THIS AIR WAS HEAVIER THAN ATMOSPHERIC AIR IT WAS READILY ABSORBED BY AGITATION IN WATER IT PRECIPITATED LIME FROM LIME WATER AND IT EXTINGUISHED FLAME THE WATER WHICH HAD AB SORBED IT CHANGED THE BLUE COLOUR OF LITMUS SLOWLY  TO A RED SO THAT THIS ELASTIC FLUID WAS UNDOUBTEDLY FIXED AIR C THE SOLUTION B BY THE ADDITION OF MILD FOSSIL FIXED ALKALY AFFORDED A PRECIPITATE WHICH AFTER PROPER WASHING AND DRYING WEIGHED 100 GRAINS 2 THIS PRECIPITATE UPON BEING AGAIN DISSOLVED IN MARINE ACID YIELDED ONLY 20 OUNCE MEASURES OF FIXED AIR  OTHER ACIDS TURN THE BLUE OF LITMUS INSTANTLY TO A RED WHILST WATER IMPREG NATED WITH FIXED AIR DOES NOT CHANGE THE LITMUS IMMEDIATELY BUT AFTER SOME SECONDS THE RED COLOUR BEGINS TO APPEAR AND THEN GRADUALLY GROWS MORE DISTINCT D TO296 DR WITHERINGS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS D TO A SATURATED SOLUTION IN MARINE ACID MILD FIXED VEGE TABLE ALKALY WAS ADDED THE EARTH WAS PRECIPITATED AND A QUAN TITY OF FIXED AIR ESCAPED 2 THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN MILD FOSSIL ALKALY WAS ADDED 3 WHEN CAUSTIC VEGETABLE ALKALY WAS USED THE PRECIPITATION TOOK PLACE BUT WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF EFFERVESCENCE 4 50 PARTS DISSOLVED IN MARINE ACID LOST DURING THE SOLU TION NEARLY 105 THIS SOLUTION UPON THE ADDITION OF CAUSTIC VEGETABLE ALKALY LET FALL A PRECIPITATE WHICH WHEN WASHED AND DRIED WEIGHED 455 5 PHLOGISTICATED ALKALY PRECIPITATED THE WHOLE OF THE EARTH FROM PART OF THE SOLUTION D FOR MILD FIXED ALKALY AFTERWARDS ADDED TO THE FILTERED LIQUOR OCCASIONED NO FURTHER PRECIPITATION E PART OF THE PRECIPITATES D 1 2 AFTER EXPOSURE TO A STRONG HEAT IN A CRUCIBLE WAS THROWN INTO WATER NEXT MORNING THE WATER WAS COMPLETELY COVERED WITH AN ICELIKE CRUST AND HAD THE ACRID TASTE OF LIMEWATER IN A VERY HIGH DEGREE 2 THE SMALLEST PORTION OF VITRIOLIC ACID ADDED TO THIS WATER OCCASIONED AN IMMEDIATE AND COPIOUS PRECIPITATION AND WHEN THIS ACRID WATER WAS DILUTED WITH 200 TIMES ITS BULK OF PURE WATER THE PRECIPITATION UPON THE ADDITION OF VITRIOLIC ACID WAS YET SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS 3 A SINGLE DROP OF THIS ACRID WATER ADDED TO SOLUTIONS OF TARTAR OF VITRIOL GLAUBERS SALT VITRIOLIC AMMONIAC ALUM EPSOM SALT SELENITE OCCASIONED AN IMMEDIATE PRECIPITATION IN ALL OF THEM F THE PRECIPITATE THROWN DOWN BY THE CAUSTIC VEGETABLE ALKALY D 3 WAS PUT INTO WATER IN EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD MAKE LIMEWATER BUT NEITHER UPON STANDING NOR AFTER BOIL ING DID THIS WATER EXHIBIT ANY PRECIPITATION WHEN CONCENTRATED VITRIOLICON THE TERRA PONDEROSA C 297 VITRIOLIC ACID WAS DROPPED IN IT NOR HAD IT ANY ACRIMONIOUS OR OTHER PECULIAR TASTE G CONCENTRATED VITRIOLIC ACID WAS ADDED TO ONE PORTION OF THE PRECIPITATE D 3 CONCENTRATED NITROUS ACID TO A SECOND PORTION AND MARINE ACID TO A THIRD PORTION NO EFFERVESCENCE COULD BE OBSERVED NOR WAS THERE ANY APPEARANCE OF SOLUTION AFTER STANDING ONE HOUR WATER WAS ADDED AND THE ACIDS THUS DILUTED WERE SUFFERED TO REMAIN UPON THE PORTIONS OF THE PRE CIPITATE FOR ANOTHER HOUR THEY WERE THEN DECANTED AND SATU RATED WITH MILD FOSSIL FIXED ALKALY BUT WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITATION H THE PART PRECIPITATED BY THE PHLOGISTICATED ALKALY WHEN MIXED WITH NITRE AND BORAX AND FLUXED BY A BLOWPIPE UPON CHARCOAL FORMED A BLACK GLASS UPON FLINTGLASS A WHITE AND UPON A TOBACCOPIPE AN OPAQUE YELLOWISH WHITE ONE 2 ANOTHER PORTION MELTED WITH SOAP AND BORAX IN A CRUCIBLE FORMED A BLACK GLASS BUT WITHOUT ANY METALLIC APPEARANCE I THE INSOLUBLE REFIDUUM A WAS BOILED IN WATER THE WATER DECANTED AND MILD FIXED ALKALY ADDED BUT WITHOUT ANY SUBSEQUENT PRECIPITATION 2 THIS INSOLUBLE POWDER WAS NOT ATTACKED BY THE NITROUS OR MARINE ACIDS BUT BEING PUT INTO VITRIOLIC ACID AND BOILED A CONSIDERABLE TIME UNTIL THE ACID BECAME HIGHLY CONCENTRATED IT DISSOLVED ENTIRELY AND SEPARATED AGAIN UPON THE ADDITION OF WA TER IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THE SAME THING HAPPENS TO MARMOR METALLICUM WHEN DISSOLVED BY BOILING IN THE ACID OF VITRIOL VOL LXXIV R R C O N298 DR WITHERINGS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS C O N C L U S I O N S HENCE IT APPEARS THAT 100 PARTS OF THIS SPAR CONTAIN TERRA PONDEROSA PURA  786 MARMOR METALLICUM 6 FIXED AIR    208 100 O B S E R V A T I O N S 1ST THE QUANTITY OF MILD FIXED ALKALY NECESSARY TO SATURATE AN ACID PREVIOUSLY UNITED TO THE TERRA PONDEROSA CONTAINS MORE FIXED AIR THAN IS NECESSARY TO SATURATE THAT QUANTITY OF TERRA PON DEROSA D 1 2 2DLY THE TERRA PONDEROSA WHEN PRECIPITATED FROM AN ACID BY MEANS OF A MILD FIXED ALKALY D 1 2 READILY BURNS TO LIME AND THIS LIMEWATER PROVES A VERY NICE TEST OF THE PRE SENCE OF VITRIOLIC ACID E 2 3 3DLY IT IS VERY REMARKABLE THAT THE TERRA PONDEROSA SPAR IN ITS NATIVE STATE WILL NOT BURN TO LIME IN THE LOWER DEGREES OF HEAT IT SUFFERS NO CHANGE AS WAS BEFORE OBSERVED BESIDES THE LOSS OF ITS TRANSPARENCY WHEN URGED WITH A STRONGER FIRE IT MELTS AND UNITES TO THE CRUCIBLE BUT DOES NOT BECOME CAUSTIC I BURIED IT IN CHARCOALDUST IN A COVERED CRUCIBLE AND THEN EXPOSED IT TO A PRETTY STRONG HEAT BUT IT DID NOT PART WITH ITS AIR MAY WE NOT CONJECTURE THEN THAT AS CAUSTIC LIME CANNOT UNITE TO FIXED AIR WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF MOISTURE AND AS THIS SPAR SEEMS TO CONTAIN NO WATER IN ITS COMPOSITION THAT IT ISON THE TERRA PONDEROSA C 299 IS THE WANT OF WATER WHICH PREVENTS THE FIXED AIR ASSUMING ITS ELASTIC AERIAL STATE THIS SUPPOSITION BECOMES STILL MORE PROBA BLE IF WE OBSERVE THAT WHEN THE SOLUTION OF THE SPAR IN AN ACID IS PRECIPITATED BY A MILD ALKALY C 1 2 SOME WATER EN TERS INTO THE COMPOSITION OF THE PRECIPITATE FOR IT WEIGHS THE SAME AS BEFORE IT WAS DISSOLVED AND YET CONTAINS ONLY 20 OUNCE MEASURES OF FIXED AIR WHILST THE NATIVE SPAR CONTAINED 25 OUNCE MEASURES SO THAT THERE IS AN ADDITION OF WEIGHT EQUAL TO THAT OF 5 OUNCE MEASURES OF FIXABLE AIR OR 314 GRAINS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHICH CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THE WATER AND THIS PRECIPITATE THUS UNITED TO WATER READILY LOSES ITS AERIAL ACID IN THE FIRE E 1 4THLY PROFESSOR BERGMAN SUPPOSES THE TERRA PONDEROSA TO BE A METALLIC EARTH  ITS ENTIRE SEPARATION FROM AN ACID BY MEANS OF THE PHLOGISTICATED ALKALY D 5 CERTAINLY FAVOURS SUCH A SUPPOSITION BUT IF IT BE SO IT IS EVIDENT FROM EXPERI MENTS H 1 2 THAT OTHER MEANS THAN THOSE COMMONLY EM PLOYED MUST BE USED TO EFFECT ITS REDUCTION 5THLY THE PRECIPITATE MADE BY THE CAUSTIC VEGETABLE ALKALY D 4 TAKING SOME OF THE ALKALY DOWN WITH IT AND THUS FORM ING A SUBSTANCE NEITHER SOLUBLE IN WATER NOR IN ACIDS IS A VERY CURIOUS PHAENOMENON I AFTERWARDS VARIED THE EXPERIMENT BY ADDING THE TERRA PON DEROSA LIMEWATER E TO CAUSTIC VEGETABLE AND CAUSTIC FOSSIL ALKALY IN BOTH CASES THIS INSOLUBLE COMPOUND WAS IMME DIATELY FORMED BUT NOT SO WHEN CAUSTIC VOLATILE ALKALY WAS USED THIS COMPOSITION OF AN ALKALY AND AN EARTH CERTAINLY DESERVES MORE ATTENTION THAN I AM AT PRESENT ABLE TO BESTOW UPON IT 6THLY AS IT APPEARS FROM EXPERIMENTS D 1 2 3 4 THAT  SEE PREFACE TO HIS SCIAGRAPHIA REGNI MINERALIS R R 2 FIXED300 DR WITHERINGS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS FIXED ALKALIES BOTH MILD AND CAUSTIC SEPARATED THE TERRA PONDEROSA FROM MARINE ACID I WAS AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHY PROFESSOR BERG MAN IN HIS ADMIRABLE TABLE OF SIMPLE ELECTIVE ATTRACTIONS PLACED THE TERRA PONDEROSA CAUSTICA IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE VI TRIOLIC NITROUS AND MARINE ACIDS AND CONSEQUENTLY ABOVE THE CAUSTIC ALKALIES I WAS INTERESTED IN THE REALITY OF THE FACTS BECAUSE I HAD SO SELDOM SEEN REASON TO DOUBT THE OBSERVATIONS OF THAT VERY EXCELLENT CHEMIST AND THEREFORE MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS TO DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF TERRA PONDEROSA SALITA AND TERRA PON DEROSA NITRATA I ADDED DROP BY DROP CAUSTIC VEGETABLE CAUSTIC FOSSIL AND CAUSTIC VOLATILE ALKALIES IN EVERY CASE THE EARTH WAS THROWN DOWN AND I HAVE SO OFTEN REPEATED THESE EXPERI MENTS TO SATISFY MYSELF AND OTHERS THAT I AM PERSUADED THE TERRA PONDEROSA CAUSTICA OUGHT TO BE PLACED BELOW THE ALKALIES EXCEPT IN THE COLUMN APPROPRIATED TO THE VITRIOLIC ACID AND IT MAY BE SEPARATED EVEN FROM THAT ACID BY THE VEGETABLE FIXED ALKALY IF THE ALKALY BE APPLIED VIA SICCA AS WILL APPEAR IN THE NEXT SECTION 7THLY THE NECESSITY FOR USING PURE ACIDS UPON MANY OCCA SIONS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING THEM PURE ARE SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS THE VITRIOLIC ACID AS MADE IN THE LARGE WAY IS GENERALLY PURE ENOUGH FOR MOST PURPOSES IT IS APT TO GET CO LOURED BY INFLAMMABLE MATTER BUT THIS IS SELDOM AN INCONVE NIENCE AND WHEN IT WOULD BE SO IT IS EASY TO DRIVE IT OFF BY BOILING THE ACID IN A FLORENCE FLASK OVER A COMMON FIRE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CAUSE OF IMPURITY IN THIS ACID WHICH APPEARS UPON DILUTING IT WITH WATER FOR THEN IT BECOMES MILKY AND IN A SHORT TIME A POWDER SUBSIDES  THE  ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I EXAMINED THIS POWDERY MATTER BOTH THAT WHICH WAS THROWNON THE TERRA PONDEROSA C 301 THE ACID MAY BE FREED FROM THIS POWDER EITHER BY DISTILLA TION IN GLASS VESSELS WHICH IS A TEDIOUS AND DANGEROUS PROCESS OR BY THE AFFUSION OF WATER AND AFTER THE POWDER HAS SUBSIDED A GENTLE EVAPORATION WILL DRIVE OFF MOST OF THE SUPERFLUOUS WATER NITROUS ACID MAY BE FREED FROM VITRIOLIC AND MARINE ACIDS BY SOLUTION OF SILVER IN THE ACID OF NITRE AS IS DAILY PRACTISED BUT THE MARINE ACID HAS NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE BEEN PURI FIED BY ANY OTHER METHOD THAN THE LABORIOUS ONE OF REDISTILLING IT FROM COMMON SALT IT IS GENERALLY MIXED WITH VITRIOLIC ACID AND OFTEN IN LARGE PROPORTION THERE IS NO TEMPTATION AND SCARCELY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR IT TO BE CONTAMINATED BY NITROUS ACID FROM THE VITRIOLIC ACID THEN IT MAY BE READILY PURIFIED BY THE ADDITION OF TERRA PONDEROSA CAUSTICA DISSOLVED IN WATER OR BY THE TERRA PONDEROSA SALITA IF THE LATTER BE USED A SMALL THROWN DOWN BY DILUTION WITH WATER AND ALSO SOME WHICH DR PRIESPLEY GAVE ME BEING THE RESIDUUM OF VITRIOLIC ACID DISTILLED TO DRYNESS IN A SLINTGLASS RETORT 1ST REPEATED BOILING IN WATER REDUCED 612 GRAINS TO 2 GRAINS 2DLY THIS SOLUTION BY GENTLE EVAPORATION AFFORDED 5 GRAINS OF CRYSTALS AS HARD AND AS TASTELESS AS SELENITE 3DLY TO THESE CRYSTALS REDISSOLVED IN WATER MILD FOSSIL ALKALY WAS ADDED AND A WHITE POWDER PRECIPITATED 4THLY THIS POWDER AFTER EXPOSURE TO A PRETTY SHARP HEAT WAS THROWN INTO WATER PART OF IT DISSOLVED AND THE WATER GOT THE TASTE AND OTHER PROPERTIES OF LIMEWATER 5THLY THE INSOLUBLE PART 1 SUFFERED NO CHANGE BY BOILING IN NITROUS ACID ONEHALF OF IT MIXED WITH BORAX AND EXPOSED TO THE BLOWPIPE UPON CHARCOAL VITRIFIED THE OTHER HALF MIXED WITH BORAX AND CHARCOALDUST LIKEWISE VITRIFIED CONCLUSIONS IT APPEARS THEN THAT THE GREATER PART OF THIS SUBSTANCE WAS CALX VITRIOLATA OR SELENITE THE REMAINDER A VITRIFIABLE EARTH I HAD BEFORE FOUND THAT THE TERRA PONDEROSA VITRIOLATA OR HEAVY GYPSUM WOULD DISSOLVE IN CONCENTRATED VITRIOLIC ACID BUT ALWAYS SEPARATED IN A POWDERY FORM UPON THE AFFUSION OF WATER AND NOW IT APPEARS THAT CALX VITRIOLATA OR SELENITE DOES THE SAME PORTION302 DR WITHERINGS EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS PORTION OF THE ACID MUST FIRST BE TRIED IN A DILUTED STATE FROM WHENCE WE MUST JUDGE HOW MUCH OF THE TERRA PONDEROSA SALITA THE WHOLE WILL REQUIRE OR ELSE THE WHOLE OF THE ACID MUST BE DILUTED WITH WATER WHETHER WE USE THE TERRA PONDEROSA DIS SOLVED IN WATER OR IN MARINE ACID IN EITHER CASE THE ACID OF VITRIOL IMMEDIATELY SEIZES UPON IT AND SUBSIDES WITH IT IN FORM OF AN INSOLUBLE POWDER AS THERE ARE REASONS FOR PREFERRING THE MARINE ACID IN SEVERAL OF THE NICER AND MORE IMPORTANT ENQUIRIES OF CHEMISTRY THIS READY METHOD OF PURIFYING IT CANNOT BUT PROVE ACCEPTABLE S E C T I O N II TERRA

LEAD CRUCIBLE LOST FIVE GRAINS IN WEIGHT BUT AS A SULPHUREOUS SMELL WAS PERCEPTIBLE I SUSPECTED THAT A DECOMPOSITION HAD TAKEN PLACE AND THEREFORE EXPOSED ANOTHER PORTION TO A SIMILAR HEAT FOR THE SAME SPACE OF TIME IN A TOBACCOPIPE THIS HAD NO SMELL OF SULPHUR NOR WAS IT DIMINISHED IN WEIGHT 2 IT IS BARELY FUSIBLE UNDER THE BLOWPIPE BUT WITH BORAX FLUXES READILY INTO A WHITE OPAKE GLASS B 100

SENSIBLY LOST WEIGHT 2 TO SEPARATE PORTIONS OF THE WASHING WATER WERE ADDED MILD VEGETABLE AND MILD FOSSIL ALKALY BUT WITHOUT ANY APPEAR ANCE OF PRECIPITATION NITRE OF MERCURY GAVE A VERY SLIGHT BROWNISH CLOUD BARELY DISCERNIBLE AND NITRE OF SILVER AN EX TREMELY SLIGHT BLUISH APPEARANCE 3 THE SAME POWDER BOILED AGAIN IN FRESH WATER DID NOT AFFECT THE WATER AT ALL FOR IT STOOD THE TEST OF

NITROUS ACID E SHOT READILY INTO BEAUTIFUL PERMANENT CRYSTALS OF A ROUGH BITTERISH TASTE 2 SOME OF THIS SALT WAS DEFLAGRATED WITH NITRE AND CHARCOAL AND THE ALKALY AFTERWARDS WASHED AWAY 3 THE RESIDUUM BEING THE EARTH OF THE MARMOR METALLI CUM WAS VERY WHITE BURNT TO LIME AND AGAIN FORMED AN IN SOLUBLE COMPOUND WITH ACID OF VITRIOL I 100 GRAINS OF TERRA PONDEROSA AERATA WERE DISSOLVED IN DI LUTED MARINE ACID VITRIOLIC ACID WAS DROPPED INTO THIS SOLU TION UNTIL NO MORE PRECIPITATION ENSUED THE PRECIPITATE AFTER VERY CAREFUL WASHING AND DRYING WAS EXPOSED TO A RED HEAT IN A COVERED

CONSEQUENTLY IT HAD TAKEN 384 OF VITRIOLIC ACID O B S E R V A T I O N S THE APPARENT INSOLUBILITY OF TERRA PONDEROSA AERATA IN THE DILUTED VITRIOLIC ACID I 2 CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY REMARKING THAT THE MOMENT THE SURFACE OF THE LUMP WAS ACTED UPON BY THE ACID AN INSOLUBLE COAT OF MARMOR METALLICUM WAS FORMED UPON IT WHICH EFFECTUALLY PRECLUDED ANY FURTHER OPERATION OF THE ACID PROFESSORON THE TERRA PONDEROSA C 307 PROFESSOR BERGMAN IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE EARTH FROM THE TERRA PONDEROSA VITRIOLATA DIRECTS THE LATTER TO BE ROASTED WITH FIXED ALKALY AND THE DUST OF CHARCOAL BUT I HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT BY CHARCOAL DUST ALONE THOUGH PROBABLY THIS METHOD MAY REQUIRE A GREATER DEGREE OF HEAT IT HAS BEEN REMARKED THAT TERRA PONDEROSA AND CALX OF LEAD RESEMBLE EACH OTHER IN MANY RESPECTS AND I MUST ADD THAT THE VITRIOL OF LEAD DISSOLVES IN THE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED VITRIOLIC ACID MUCH IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THE MARMOR METALLICUM DOES AND LIKE THIS TOO SEPARATES UPON THE AFFUSION OF WATER BUT I NEVER OBSERVED IT DISPOSED TO CRYSTALLIZE THE MARMOR METALLICUM MAY PROBABLY BE USEFUL IN SOME CASES WHERE A POWERFUL FLUX IS WANTED FOR I ONCE MIXED SOME OF IT WITH THE BLACK FLUX AND EXPOSING IT TO A

TERRA PONDEROSA C 311 G E N E R A L O B S E R V A T I O N S THE TERRA PONDEROSA SEEMS TO CLAIM A PLACE BETWIXT THE EARTHS AND THE METALLIC CALCES LIKE THE FORMER IT CANNOT BE MADE TO ASSUME A METALLIC FORM BUT LIKE THE LATTER IT MAY BE PRE CIPITATED FROM AN ACID BY MEANS OF PHLOGISTICATED ALKALY IN MANY OF ITS PROPERTIES IT MUCH RESEMBLES THE CALX OF LEAD AND IN OTHERS THE COMMON CALCAREOUS EARTH BUT STILL SEEMS SUFFICIENTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT TO CONSTITUTE A NEW GENUS AS WILL APPEAR FROM A LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES TERRA PONDEROSA TERRA CALCAREA WHEN DISSOLVED IN WATER

HEAVY ENOUGH TO COUNTENANCE SUCH AN APPELLATION BUT THE EARTH ITSELF DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A HEAVY SUBSTANCE AND I IMAGINE THE GREAT WEIGHT OF ITS COMPOUNDS WITH THE VITRIOLIC AND AERIAL ACIDS IS

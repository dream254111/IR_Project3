j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1014235,A Discussion of Professor Cassels Article,i242678,A DISCUSSION OF PROFESSOR CASSELS ARTICLE By A BARTON HEPBURN Chairman Advisory Board Chase National Bank New York City I have read Professor Gustav Cas sels paper with very great interest and general approval I take exception to some things however What has Happened to the Worlds Monetary Standards is well stated Like all devotees of the quantity theory of money however Professor Cassel gets the cart before the horse Under the heading Popular Ideas in arguing that the quantity of money fixes the price level and in combating popular ideas which are erroneous in his opinion he says This is the case eg when people speak of high wages high cost of raw material etc as the causes of the general increase in prices The cost and hence the prices of finished goods are represented mainly by the cost of labor and the cost of raw material When the cost of these items is increased the cost of the finished product is neces sarily increased and high or higher prices inevitably result This is so manifestly true that it seems strange that anyone can argue that the quan tity of money is alone responsible for increased prices People do not actually borrow money in advance with which to go shopping even when they arrange credit in advance The issue of the credit instrument in pay ment invaribly follows the trans actions People buy products and then they seek some sort of credit282 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY with which to pay for the same This may result in increased bank credit it may result in certain instances in increased bank circulating notes but the increase of the credit instrument whatever form it may take follows the business transaction and is the result and not the cause When at the beginning of the European war because of the limited supply of com modities different nations began bid ding against each other in order to supply their needs that bidding nec essarily increased the price Then these respective bidders sought credit as a means of payment It was the competitive bidding that advanced the prices not the creation of credit instruments with which to pay for commodities The fact that Europe in the first two years of the war sent us a billion dollars in gold in payment for their purchases was not what advanced prices nor would the cause have been money had they made loans in this country instead to pay the debts in curred It was their necessitous and insistent demand for the product and their bidding against each other that advanced prices and not the quan tity of money or credit instruments Credit instruments whether currency or otherwise are not created in ad vance of business transactions but are created to enable the party purchasing to consummate the transaction by means of payment Payment is a subsequent event I agree with Professor Cassel that the world is suffering at present most severely from the uncertainty of the internal value of money in the different countries Many years ago my bank correspondent in Amsterdam gave me a luncheon which was attended gen erally by the bankers of Amsterdam I recall one of the bankers telling me that during our Civil War he pur chased a large volume of United States bonds paying for the same in European exchange which of course was the equivalent of gold at that time at 43 cents on the dollar He held these bonds until after the resumption of specie payment in 1879 and later sold them at 118 Gold went to a premium in the United States in 1862 and re mained at a premium until the resump tion of specie payment January 1 1879 During this interval we had the greenback craze and the doubt as to whether the United States would redeem its obligations in gold according to their tenure had the effect of greatly depreciating our currency Our legal tender note was worth at one time only 40 cents on the dollar From the close of the Civil War till January 1 1879 there was a continuous trade balance in favor of the United States The balance of trade is only one factor in determining exchange the doubt as to the real value of a countrys cur rency is another and very important element to be considered Professor Cassel says also In the whole world the rates of discount have been too low during the war That is manifestly true If our government had offered its bonds at the current rate of interest instead of appealing to the patriotism of thepeople and resorting to a propaganda in order to place the issue the bonds would have stayed at par or above and the public would have continued to own them instead of selling them forcing them into money centers and very largely into the banks The apparent savingDiscussioNs 283 in the low rate of interest cost people many times that rate of interest in the depreciation of their securities and the inflation of prices generally Prices generally depend upon the law of supply and demand Money is no exception High prices lessen the demand and tend to bring about a stable equilibrium It is always in the interests of commercial commu nities to charge fair rates for money as it is to charge fair rates for any other article or service Had our govern ment paid fair rates they would have kept their securities at or about par kept them in the hands of the public and made it much easier to overcome high prices which are the result of inflation Our government spent over a billion dollars purchasing its own securities in the market under the mistaken idea that they were sustaining the prices of the same The prices nevertheless continued to recede Had they not adopted this policy the interest being certificates in the banks would be less ened by that amount and our com mercial and financial interests would be in that much better position We can have no deflation until this floating debt of the government carried by the banks in the form of interest bearing certificates which now exceeds three billions of dollars is retired The banks will then have sufficient funds to supply the commercial de mands of the business community and prices will go down from their present dizzy height to a more normal level I cordially endorse what Professor Cassel says about the reduction of state expenditures Until the incomes of the governments recently at war equal their expenditures in other words so long as they go on increasing their debt deflation is impossible and the uncertainty of the value of their currency is intensified This is a question which must be settled by each country itself Eng lands trade balance according to Lloyd George is now favorable and her income will for the present fiscal year equal her expenditures England is in a position to come back and resume her position as one of the leading com mercial nations of the world The continental countries are by no means in as favorable a condition

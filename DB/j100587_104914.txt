AND F R S,I206914,96 XXI QUERIES SENT TO A FRIEND IN CONSTAN TINOPLE BY DR MATY F R S AND AN SWERED BY HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES PORTER ESQ HIS MAJESTYS AMBASSADOR AT CON STANTINOPLE AND F R S THE QUERIES PROPOSED WERE THE SEVEN FOLLOWING WHETHER WE MAY KNOW WITH ANY CERTAINTY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY CARRIED OFF BY THE PLAGUE AT CONSTANTI NOPLE READ APRIL 10 1 1755 2 WHETHER THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS IN THAT CAPITAL MAY BE ASCERTAINED 3 WHETHER WHAT HAS BEEN ADVANCED BY SOME TRAVELLERS AND FROM THEM ASSUMED BY WRITERS ON PO LITICS BE TRUE THAT THERE ARE MORE WOMEN THAN MEN BORN IN THE EAST 4 WHETHER PLURALITY OF WIVES IS IN FACT AS IT WAS CONFIDENTLY AFFIRMED TO BE IN THE ORDER OF NATURE FAVOURABLE TO THE INCREASE OF MANKING 5 WHAT IS THE ACTUAL STATE OF INOCULATION IN THE EAST 6 WHAT IS BECOME OF THE PRINTINGHOUSE AT CON STANTINOPLE AND ARE THERE ANY ORIGINAL MAPS OF THE TURKISH DOMINIONS DRAWN FROM ACTUAL SURVEYS 7 WHAT SORT OF LEARNING IS CULTIVATED AMONG THE GREEKS AND AMONG THE TURKS TO97 TO THESE QUERIES HIS EXCELLENCY JAMES PORTER ESQ HIS MAJESTYS AMBASSADOR AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND FELLOW OF THIS SOCIETY WAS PLEASED TO MAKE THE FOL LOWING ANSWER 1 THE ONLY PLAGUE WHICH I OBSERVED AT CONSTAN TINOPLE IN THE COURSE OF SEVEN YEARS WAS THAT OF THE YEAR 1751 THERE ARE ALMOST ANNUALLY DISPERSED ACCI DENTS SOME PERHAPS REAL SOME SUGGESTED BY TRICK AND DESIGN TO SERVE SINISTER PURPOSES I ATTEMPTED THAT YEAR TO THROW SOME OBSERVATIONS ON PAPER BUT ALL THAT I COULD MAKE OUT OF THEM WAS SO UNSATISFACTORY TRITE AND IMPERFECT THAT I THOUGHT THEM ON A REVIEW SCARCE WORTH NOTICE I AM CONVINCED THAT WHATEVER IS TOLD US OF THAT DISTEMPER IS SCARCE TO BE DEPENDED ON RATHER CON JECTURE THAN OBSERVATION RATHER THE PLAY OF IMAGINA TION THAN FACT HOWEVER I HAD MADE IT A PRINCIPAL STUDY TO ATTAIN TO SOME DATA WHEREBY I COULD DRAW A PROBABLE CONCLUSION CONCERNING THE NUMBER OF THE DEAD THAT YEAR WHICH MIGHT ALSO HAVE LED ME TO HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT OF THE INHABITANTS AT CONSTAN TINOPLE 2 THE TURKS HAVE NO REGISTER NO BILLS OF MOR TALITY THEY ARE PROHIBITED BY THEIR LAW TO ENUME RATE THE PEOPLE I APPLIED TO THE REIS EFFENDI AND OTHER MINISTERS OF THE PORTE TO KNOW WHAT PROBABLE CALCULATION THEY COULD MAKE CONCERNING THE NUM BER OF DEAD BUT THEY ALL CONCURRED IN ONE GENERAL ANSWER THAT THEY HAD NO OTHER BUT WHAT WAS FOUNDED ON THE DECREASE OF THE CONSUMPTION OF THE QUANTITY OF CORN OR BREAD AND IN GENERAL TALKED OF ABOUT 150000 I THEREFORE BETOOK MYSELF WITH ALL MY VOL 49 O CARE98 CARE AND INDUSTRY TO TRY WHAT PROBABLE CONCLUSIONS I COULD DRAW FROM THAT IMPERFECT DATUM CORN IS DELIVERED OUT BY AN OFFICER OF CONSIDERATION AND AN EXACT REGISTER KEPT BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE PLAGUE THAT WAS IN MARCH AND APRIL 1751 THE CONSUMPTION OF CORN WAS 19000 MEASURES CALLED KHILOS ON ITS CONTI NUANCE AND DECREASE IT DIMINISHED TO 17000 AND ON ITS TOTAL CESSATION IT WAS FOUND NOT TO AMOUNT TO ABOVE 14000 A KHILO WEIGHS TWENTYTWO OKES IT IS GROUNDED TO EIGHTEEN OKES OF FLOWER THE BAKERS HAVE GENERALLY THE SECRET TO MAKE OUT OF THIS LAST QUANTITY TWENTYSEVEN OKES OF BREAD THEY ADD TO AN OKE OF FLOWER ONE OF WATER BESIDES SOME SALT AND AS THEIR BREAD IS ALMOST DOUGH FEW OF THE WATRY PARTICLES ARE EXHALED AND IT IS THOUGHT OF THE BEST IF IT IS NOT DOUBLED IN QUANTITY WHEN TAKEN OUT OF THE OVEN THE COMMON PEOPLE AND EVEN MOST OF THE MID DLING AND EASY LIVE PRINCIPALLY ON BREAD THE FOR MER WITH ONION GARLICK FRUITS OR PULSE ACCORDING TO THE SEASONS THE LATTER WITH VERY SMALL PORTIONS OF FLESH OR FISH THE MORE LABORIOUS PROFESSIONS AS LABOURING MEN STONECUTTERS CARPENTERS C EAT FROM TWO TO TWO AND A HALF OKES A DAY THE OTHER ACCORDING TO THE COMMON RUN OF FAMILIES COMPOSED OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN HALF AN OKE EACH SO THAT THE LOWEST CALCULATION ON A MEDIUM MAY BE ABOUT AN OKE AND A QUARTER DAILY EATEN BY EACH PERSON AT CONSTANTINOPLE BUT SHOULD IT BE THOUGHT TOO MUCH AN OKE WHICH IS TWO POUNDS THREEQUARTERS ENGLISH WE MAY SUP POSE99 POSE NEARER TRUTH THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS THEN WILL RESULT THAT THEREFORE ON THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF 19000  27 WE HAVE 513000 THE QUANTITY OF OKES OF BREAD CONSUMED AND CONSEQUENTLY THE NUMBER OF SOULS AT CONSTANTINOPLE THAT ON THE DECREASE OF THE PLAGUE TO 17000 54000 PERSONS WERE EITHER DEAD OR MIS ING THAT WHEN THE QUANTITY WAS REDUCED TO 14000 ON THE CESSATION THOSE EITHER FLED OR DEAD AMOUNTED TO 135000 IT IS SAID BY SOME THAT CONSTANTINOPLE CONTAINS NEAR THREE MILLIONS OF INHABITANTS BUT ON WHATEVER SUPPOSITION WE TAKE THE CONSUMPTION OF THE QUANTITY OF BREAD THAT QUANTITY WILL BE FOUND ERRONEOUS ON A GROSS CALCULATION MADE BY SOME OF THE PRIN CIPAL MEN AND PARTICULARLY THE CHIORBACHEES OR COLONELS OF JANIZARIES WHO HAD THEIR STATIONS AT THE MOST NOTED AND ONLY PLACES WHERE THE FUNERALS PASS THEY RECKONED FOR SIX WEEKS WHILST THE PLAGUE WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AND IN ITS CRISIS FROM 900 TO 1000 PER DIEM AND THAT THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF THE DEAD IN THAT TIME MIGHT BE ABOUT 40000 AND FROM THE TIME IT WAS IN ITS INCREASE AND DECLINE THEY ADDED 15 TO 20000 MORE IF THEREFORE WE ADMIT 60000 IN THE WHOLE IT WILL BE AS THAT SUM TO 513000 OR AS 1 TO 8 1120 THERE IS A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THIS PROPORTION AND THE NUMBER OF DEAD WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT OF THE ADRIANOPLEGATE DURING TWELVE DAYS THE SAME SEASON OF THE YEAR 1752 AND OF THE LIKE NUMBER OF DAYS IN 1751 O 2 1752100 1752 HEALTH 1751 PLAGUE JUNE 1411 JUNE 1224 15 3 1329 16 5 1432 17 5 1535 18 4 1624 19 8 2050 20 3 2534 22 3 2237 23 5 2352 24 4 JULY 1456 25 5 1557 26 3 1659   59 489   SO THAT THE NUMBER OF DEAD AT LEAST THROUGH THAT GATE IN TIME OF COMMON HEALTH WAS TO THOSE IN THAT OF SICKNESS AS 59 TO 489 OR AS 1 TO 8 13 NEARLY THE ADRIANOPLEGATE IS RECKONED THE GREATEST PAS SAGE FOR THE DEAD ON ACCOUNT OF ITS VICINITY TO THE MOST EXTENSIVE BURIALPLACES A GREAT DEDUCTION MUST BE MADE FOR THE VAST DE CREASE OF THE CONSUMPTION OF WHEAT TOWARDS THE CESSATION OF THE PLAGUE FROM THE CONSIDERABLE NUM BERS WHO FLED INTO ASIA THE ISLANDS OF THE ARCHIPE LAGO AND ROMELIA A COGENT ARGUMENT WITH ME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT CONSTANTINOPLE IS NOT PEOPLED IN PROPORTION TO ITS EXTENT IS THE IMMENSE CARE WHICH THE LATE SULTAN MAHMUD TOOK NOT TO ADMIT NEW INHABITANTS OR STRANGERS101 STRANGERS NONE COULD REMAIN A NIGHT IN THE CITY WITHOUT COMMANDS FROM THE PORTE AND THOSE WERE WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY OBTAINED IT IS EXTREME DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO COME AT ANY OTHER COMPUTUS OF THE NUMBER OF INHABITANTS MUCH MORE SO OF HOUSES AT CONSTANTINOPLE THE CITY IS DIVIDED SOMEWHAT IN THE MANNER IT WAS UNDER THE GRAECIAN EMPIRE THAT IS INTO DIFFERENT QUARTERS CALLED MAHALES AND EACH UNDER THE SPECIAL DIRECTION OF AN IMAUM AS FAR AS IT EXTENDS TO THEIR IMME DIATE ADVANTAGE THEY ARE INFORMED OF THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES IN THEIR DISTRICT BUT WHOEVER WOULD DARE TO COLLECT FROM THEM MIGHT NOT ONLY RISK THE CEN SURE OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT HIS HEAD BESIDES IF THE INQUIRY IS GENERAL CONCERNING HOUSES IT IS IM POSSIBLE TO FIX A DETERMINED IDEA THEY CONFOUND PA LACE SERAGLIO SHOP ROOM AND CALL THEM INDISCRI MINATELY HOUSES THE JEWS SAY THAT THEY HAVE 1 0000 HOUSES AT CONSTANTINOPLE BUT IN WHAT WE CALL A HOUSE THERE ARE PERHAPS TEN FAMILIES AND THE DI STINCT NUMBER OF THE LATTER THEY DARE NOT MENTION I ENDEAVOURED WITH PERSUASION AND ALL MY WEIGHT TO INDUCE THE GREEK AND ARMENIAN PATRIARCHS TO OB TAIN FOR ME A REGISTER OF THE BIRTHS AND BURIALS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES BUT AT LENGTH THEY ACKNOW LEGED IT IMPOSSIBLE THEIR PARISHES ARE FARMED TO CURATES BY THE DIOCESAN BISHOPS THE INCOME ARISES FROM BIRTHS AND BURIALS SO THAT TO CONCEAL THE FORMER THEY MUST LIKEWISE THE LATTER AND THEY NEVER EXHIBIT A FAITHFUL REGISTER 3 THAT THERE ARE MORE WOMEN THAN MEN BORN IN THE EAST SEEMS A FIGMENT OF TRAVELLERS RATHER THAN SOUNDED IN TRUTH IT IS SCARCE TO BE KNOWN WHERE POLYGAMY 1102 POLYGAMY IS LAWFUL THE APPARENT CONCLUSION MAY SEEM NATURAL BECAUSE MANY OF THE HAREMS OF THE OPULENT ESPECIALLY IN THE GREAT CITIES ARE NUMEROUS BUT THESE ARE NOT COMPOSED OF THE NATIVES OF THOSE CITIES BUT ARE BROUGHT FROM COUNTRIES WHERE THE CHRISTIAN RITES ARE OBSERVED IN TIME OF PEACE FROM GEORGIA AND OF WAR FROM HUNGARY AND RUSSIA C SO THAT IF MORE WOMEN ARE FOUND IN SUCH FAMILIES THAN MEN THEY MUST BE LOOKED UPON AS AN EXTRA NEOUS PRODUCTION ANNUALLY OR DAILY IMPORTED I THINK I CAN AVER ON GOOD FOUNDATION THAT WE HAVE NOT YET EXTANT AN EXACT GENUINE ACCOUNT OF THE CUSTOMS MANNERS AND PRACTICES OF THESE PEOPLE NOR REALLY OF THESE COUNTRIES THOSE WHICH I HAVE READ ARE EXTREME FAULTY NOT TO SAY WORSE IN MANY PARTICULARS WHICH HAVE FALLEN UNDER MY OWN KNOW LEGE WHAT AM I THEN TO CONCLUDE AS TO THOSE THAT HAVE NOT AND HOW CAN A TOURNEFORT AND MANY OTHERS I COULD NAME IN RUNNING OVER VAST TRACKS OF COUNTRIES IN TWO YEARS OR LESS SOMETIMES BY NIGHT SOMETIMES BY DAY WITH HASTY CARAVANS GIVE US A TRUE HISTORY EVEN RICAUTS HE WHO DWELT SOME YEARS IN THESE COUNTRIES IS FOUNDED ON VERY IMPER FECT MEMOIRS WHAT HE SAYS OF THE INTERIOR OF THE SERAGLIO IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE KNOWN AND I FIND BY SOME ORIGINAL LETTERS OF HIS FROM HAMBURG TO A NEPHEW HE HAD AS SECRETARY TO THIS EMBASSY THAT HE BEGGED FOR SOME NOTES OF ONE MR COKE FORMERLY IN THAT OFFICE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE HIS HISTORY NOW IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL SUCH NOTES MUST HAVE BEEN ONLY THE HEARSAY OF THE CHRISTIANS OF PERA WHO NEITHER HAVE NOR EVER HAD KNOWLEGE OR OBSERVATION SUFFI CIENT TO BE DEPENDED ON NOR DARE THEY VENTURE TO ENTER103 ENTER INTO INTIMATE PARTICULARS WITH SUCH MAHOMETANS AS COULD TRULY INFORM THEM CREDULITY AND VULGAR ERRORS ABOUND AS A CONSE QUENCE OF THEIR FAITH FOR THEY ARE ALL GREEKS OR RO MANISTS THOSE ARE TAKEN TRADITIONALLY TO INSTANCE IN ONE COLLECTED FROM THEM AND UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED BY TRAVELLERS THEY TELL US THAT THE TURKS MAKE PUB LICK PRAYERS AND PROCESSIONS IN TIME OF PLAGUE WHEN 1000 CORPS A DAY ARE CARRIED OUT OF THE ADRIANOPLE GATE THIS TRADITION WAS CURRENT IN THE YEAR 1751 I KNEW IT MUST BE FALSE FROM THE VERY KORAN HOW EVER I HAD THE QUESTION PUT TO MANY PARTICULARLY TO THE REIS EFFENDI GREAT CHANCELLOR OF THE EMPIRE WHO LET ME KNOW THEY NEVER NUMBERED THEM NOR INQUIRED MINUTELY HOW MANY DIED THAT IN TIME OF GREAT CALAMITY OR SICKNESS THEY ONLY ORDERED A PASSAGE OF THE KORAN TO BE READ IN THEIR MOSCHES THUS BY A SINGLE INQUIRY I DETECTED A FABLE WHICH HAS PASSED CURRENT SINCE MAHOMET THE SECONDS TIME THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY 4 I CAN AFFIRM WITH TRUTH WHAT MAY SEEM A PA RADOX THAT IN GENERAL MAHOMETANS NOTWITHSTAND ING THEIR LAW PROCREATE LESS THAN CHRISTIANS THE RICH WHO ARE THE ONLY PERSONS THAT CAN MAINTAIN CONCUBINES HAVE SELDOM FOUR OR FIVE CHILDREN FEW I HAVE HEARD OF OR KNOWN EXCEED TWO OR THREE MANY OF THE FORMER AND MOST OF THE MIDDLING AND POORER SORT HAVE GENERALLY BUT ONE WIFE THE LATTER INDEED EXCHANGE THEM WITH FACILITY BUT YET WE DO NOT PER CEIVE THEY HAVE A NUMEROUS PROGENY I TAKE THIS TO ARISE FROM A CAUSE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS COM MONLY ASSIGNED NOT FROM THEIR BEING ENERVATED BY VARIETY BUT RATHER FROM THEIR LAW THE FREQUENT ABLUTIONS104 ABLUTIONS REQUIRED BY THE DOCTRINE OF PURITY AND IM PURITY PERHAPS MAY CHECK THE LIBIDINOUS PASSION OR WHEN IT IS AT ITS HEIGHT THEY FIND THEMSEVES PROHI BITED ENJOYMENT TO ENFORCE THIS OBSERVATION MIGHT LEAD ME INTO SOME SINGULAR REFLECTIONS 5 INOCULATION IS PRACTISED AT PRESENT AMONG THE GREEKS AND NOTWITHSTANDING RELIGIOUS SCRUPLES AMONG THE ROMANISTS WITH THE FEW WHOM I HAVE KNOWN IT GENERALLY SUCCEEDED BUT THE NUMBERS WILL NOT ADMIT OF COMPARISON THERE ARE NOT PERHAPS TWENTY IN A YEAR INOCULATED THE TIMONI FAMILY PRE TEND THAT A DAUGHTER HAD BEEN INOCULATED AT SIX MONTHS OLD BUT AFTERWARDS ACQUIRED THE SMALLPOX IN THE NATURAL WAY AND DIED AT TWENTYTHREE YEARS THE EVIDENCE IS DOUBTFUL TIMONIS ACCOUNT IS INCOR RECT HIS FACTS ARE NOT TO BE DEPENDED ON PYLARINIS IS MORE EXACT IT WAS NEITHER CIRCASSIANS GEORGIANS NOR ASIATICS WHO INTRODUCED THE PRACTICE THE FIRST WOMAN WAS OF THE MOREA HER SUCCESSOR WAS A BOS NIAC THEY BROUGHT IT FROM THESSALY INFERREDOFINFERRED THE PELO PONNESUS NOW MOREA THEY PROPERLY SCARIFIED THE PATIENT COMMONLY ON MANY PARTS SOMETIMES ON THE FOREHEAD UNDER THE HAIR SOMETIMES ON THE CHEEKS AND ON THE RADIUS OF THE ARM A FATHER TOLD ME THAT THE OLD WOMAN NOT BEING ABLE THROUGH AGE TO MAKE THE INCISION ON HIS DAUGHTER WITH THE RAZOR HE PER FORMED THAT OPERATION THE NEEDLE HAS ALSO BEEN USED THE TURKS NEVER INOCULATE THEY TRUST TO THEIR FATUM WHENCE THE METHOD HAD ITS ORIGIN SEEMS HERE UN KNOWN A CAPUCHIN FRIAR WHOM I OFTEN SEE WAS ON A MISSION IN GEORGIA FOR ABOVE SIXTEEN YEARS HE HAS RE TURNED ABOUT TWO YEARS HE IS A GRAVE SOBER MAN WHO GIVES AN HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE VIRTUES AND VICES GOOD AND105 AND EVIL OF THAT COUNTRY WITH PLAINNESS AND CAN DOUR THE USUAL INTRODUCTION AND SECURITY OF THESE MISSIONARIES IS THE PRETENCE TO THE PRACTICE OF PHY SIC THAT IN DESTROYING BODIES THEY MAY SAVE SOULS SO THAT THIS HONEST MAN WHO IS EXTREMELY IGNORANT WAS IN HIGH REPUTATION BOTH AS PHYSICIAN AND CON FESSOR IT WAS THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE AS HE HIMSELF OBSERVES THAT EITHER THE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PRACTICE OF INOCULATION COULD BE CONCEALED FROM HIM BUT HE HAS MOST SOLEMNLY DECLARED TO ME REPEATEDLY THAT HE NEVER HEARD ONE WORD ABOUT IT AT AKALSIKE IMI RETTE OR TIFFLIS HE IS PERSUADED THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN AMONG THEM HE HAS OFTEN AND FRE QUENTLY ATTENDED THE SMALLPOX WHICH IS ALMOST CER TAIN DEATH THERE AND GENERALLY IF NOT ALWAYS OF THE CONFLUENT KIND 6 PRINTING WAS INTRODUCED BY AN HUNGARIAN RE NEGADO WHO CALLED HIMSELF IBRAHIM EFFENDI IT HAD NO LONG CONTINUANCE THE COPIES ARE NOT MANY AND ARE NOW VERY DEAR AND SCARCE FEW EVEN TO BE BOUGHT THE MAPS DID NOT EXCEED THREE OR FOUR ONE OF PERSIA ONE OF THE BOSPHORUS AND ONE OF THE EUXI NUS OR BLACKSEA THEY ARE NOT TO BE FOUND BUT IN PRIVATE HANDS ALL OUR MAPS OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE EXTREMELY IMPERFECT AND INCORRECT THE JEALOUSY AND SUPERSTITION OF THE PEOPLE THO THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PERMIT CHRISTIANS TO RAISE ANY PRINTINGHOUSE WOULD BE AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPEDIMENT AND THEY ARE TOO IGNORANT THEMSELVES TO BE EVER CA PABLE OF DOING IT THE ADOPTIVE SON OF THIS IBRA HIM EFFENDI WHO BEARS THE SAME NAME IS SECRETARY UNDER THE INTERPRETER OF THE PORTE HE HAS ALL THE VOL 49 P MATERIALS106 MATERIALS FOR PRINTING BUT NEVER COULD FIND SINCE HIS FATHERS DEATH AND DURING SULTAN MAHMUDS REIGN MONEY TO CARRY IT ON THE QUESTION IS NOW WHETHER SULTAN OSMAN IS NOT TOO STRICT A MUSSULMAN TO CONTINUE THE PERMISSION 7 THE PROGRESS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES AND LITERA TURE SEEMS TRAVELLING ON GRADATIM TO THE WESTWARD FROM AEGYPT TO GREECE FROM GREECE TO ROME THENCE TO THE WEST OF EUROPE AND I SUPPOSE AT LAST TO AMERICA WE FIND FEW TRACES IN THE EAST THE GREEKS WHO SHOULD BE THE DEPOSITARIES OF THEM ARE THE SAME GREEKS THEY EVER WERE HOMINES CONTENTIONIS CUPIDIORES QUAM VERITATIS THEY HAVE RETAINED ALL THE VICES IMPERFECTIONS ILL HABITUDES OF THEIR AN CESTORS BUT HAVE LOST ALL THEIR PUBLIC SPIRIT AND PUBLIC VIRTUES THE CLERGY WHO SHOULD SUPPORT THE WHOLE MACHINE OF LEARNING ARE THEMSELVES THE SOURCE OF IGNORANCE ALL THEIR TALENTS AND ACQUISITIONS CON SIST IN BRIBING AMONGST THE TURKS AND SOLLICITING TO DESTROY ONE PATRIARCH IN ORDER TO MAKE ANOTHER TO RAISE FROM A CURACY TO A BISHOPRICK AND TO EXCHANGE FROM AN INDIFFERENT ONE TO A BETTER THEY ENDEA VOUR TO CULTIVATE LITERAL GREEK AND SOME STUDY IT BUT ADVANCE NO FURTHER THERE ARE NEITHER GRAM MARIANS CRITICS HISTORIANS NOR PHILOSOPHERS AMONG THEM NOR HAVE THEY PROPER PRECEPTORS OR MASTERS TO INSTRUCT THEY HAVE FORMED A SORT OF AN ACADEMY AT MOUNT ATHOS FOR THEIR YOUTH WHICH WILL SCARCE SURVIVE THE PERSON WHO HAS UNDERTAKEN IT HE HAS HIMSELF BUT THE MERE ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE HOW EVER HIS DESIRE OF KNOWING MAY IMPROVE HIM AND HE MAY PERHAPS LAY THE FOUNDATIONS IN SOME YOUTH WITH SUCCESS THE107 THE TURKS HAVE MANY BOOKS AMONGST THEM THO EXCEEDINGLY DEAR FOLIOS I HAVE SEEN COST 100 TO 2 AND 300 DOLLARS EACH IE FROM 15 L TO 45 L THE FEW PRINTED FOLIOS SOME OF WHICH I PICKD UP SOME YEARS AGO COST 5 L TO 6 L STERLING THEIR SCRIBES SPEND MANY YEARS ABOUT A FEW COPIES THEIR LEARN ING CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY IN ABSTRUSE METAPHYSICS SOME FEW TOUCH THE SURFACE OF SCIENCE I HAVE LOOKED OUT WITH GREAT INDUSTRY FOR OLD ARABIAN MANUSCRIPTS IN THE MATHEMATICAL WAY WHAT THEY BROUGHT ME WERE TRANSLATIONS OF SOME PROPOSITIONS OF EUCLID THEO DOSIUS ARCHIMEDES AND APOLLONIUS THEY HAVE SOME PARTS OF ARISTOTLE BUT THEIR FAVOURITE PHILOSO PHY IS THE ATOMICAL OR EPICUREAN WHICH WITH THEM IS CALLED THE DEMOCRITICAL FROM DEMOCRITUS MANY OF THEIR SPECULATIVE MEN HAVE ADOPTED THAT SYSTEM AND CONFORM TO IT IN THEIR SECRET PRACTICE THE IN STITUTES AND PRACTICE OF PHYSIC ARE TAKEN FROM GALEN EBEN ZYNA OR AVICENA IS A PRINCIPAL GUIDE MA THIOLUS IS KNOWN BUT WITH ALL THIS AS THE SOLE DRIFT AND END OF THEIR STUDY IS GAIN THERE DOES NOT SEEM THE LEAST EMULATION TOWARDS TRUE KNOWLEGE SO THAT THE STATE OF LETTERS MAY BE SAID TO REMAIN DEPLORABLE WITHOUT THE LEAST GLIMMERING OR REMOTE PROSPECT OF A RECOVERY J P CONSTANTINOPLE FEB 1 1755 P 2 SINCE108 SINCE THE RECEPTION OF THIS MEMOIR DR MATY HAS RECEIVED ANOTHER LETTER FROM THE SAME GENTLEMAN IN WHICH HE FINDS SOME NEW FACTS TENDING TO CLEAR UP THE ACCOUNTS RELATING TO THE PRACTICE OF INOCULATION AMONG THE GEORGIANS THESE HE HOPES WILL NOT BE UNACCEPTABLE AS THEY COME FROM A PERSON EQUALLY ABLE BY HIS UNIVERSAL KNOWLEGE AND DISTINGUISHED STATION TO PROCURE THE BEST INFORMATIONS AND WILLING FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND TO COMMUNICATE THEM IN THE MOST OBLIGING AND CANDID MANNER CONSTANTINOPLE MAY 17 1755 I A M NOW TO CORRECT THE REPORT OF THE CAPUCHIN CONCERNING INOCULATION IN GEORGIA ONE OF THEIR PHYSICIANS A MOST IGNORANT FELLOW WHO LIVES BY HIS PROFESSION HERE AVERS THAT AMONG THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE TRUE GEORGIAN RITES NOT ROMANISTS THE PRACTICE IS COMMON IT HAS ITS RISE FROM MERE SUPERSTITION HE TELLS US  THAT THE TRADICTION AND RELIGIOUS BE  LIEF OF THAT PEOPLE IS THAT AN ANGEL PRESIDES OVER  THAT DISTEMPER THAT THEREFORE TO SHEW THEIR CON  FIDENCE IN HIM AND TO INVITE HIM TO BE PROPI  TIOUS THEY TAKE A POX FROM THE SICK PERSON AND  BY A SCARIFICATION THEY INSERT IT IN ONE IN HEALTH  GENERALLY BETWEEN THE FOREFINGER AND THUMB IT  NEVER MISSES ITS EFFECT AND THE PATIENT ALWAYS RE  COVERS TO ATTRACT THE ANGELS GOODWILL MORE  EFFECTUALLY THEY HANG THE PATIENTS BED WITH RED  CLOTH OR STUFF AS A COLOUR MOST AGREEABLE TO HIM  HE HAS BEEN ASSISTANT TO THIS PRACTICE AND DECLARES  IT TO BE COMMON PERHAPS THE ONLY GOOD EFFECT EVER KNOWN PRODUCED BY THAT MONSTER SUPERSTITION THE CAPUCHIN ACKNOWLEGES THAT IT MIGHT BE AMONGST THE109 THE GEORGIANS THE DOCTOR MENTIONS AND NOT HAVE FELL UNDER HIS KNOWLEGE TO VINDICATE HIS IGNORANCE HE DISTINGUISHES THE PARTS OF GEORGIA OR ITS DIVISIONS HE HAS NEVER BEEN AT CACKETT AND STAID BUT THREE WEEKS AT ONCE IN TIFFLIS J P

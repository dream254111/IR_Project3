MISSIONS JAMES L BARTON BosTON One would be indeed presumptuous to predict the effect of this war upon foreign missionary operations Indeed to report fully the present effect of this world war upon the work of the various foreign missionary societies of the world is an impossible task Missionary leaders are however attempting to estimate the significance of the present bearing of war conditions while few would be so bold as to suggest even what the future may be That foreign missionaries and their operations are seriously and fundamentally affected all will agree It could hardly be otherwise when nearly every country in which foreign missionaries and their institutions are located is under the flag of one of the belligerent powers and much mission territory is actually within the zone of war or of active military preparations Within the war zone are the mission fields of the Balkan Peninsula all of the Turkish Empire Syria Arabia Egypt Persia all of the former German colonies in Africa and the islands of the Pacific held by Germany at the outbreak of the war while North Africa Ceylon India Burmah Siam British South Africa and Portuguese East and West Africa are upon the borderland of war or of direct2 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW preparation for war Beyond these areas all that re mains of Africa all of China Japan extensive sections of South America and the Philippine Islands as well as other lesser territories are under a flag of one of the Allies and so are within the war field and subject to special war regulations We can mention here but few of the conditions which have especially confronted for eign missionary enterprises during the last four years some of which have been fundamental to future work while others are only incidental and will quickly pass when war conditions cease I EXTERNAL CONDITIONS The first missionary areas to be seriously disturbed were the four German colonies in Africa and the German possessions in the Pacific Islands These colonies and the Islands were the field of Protestant missionary oper ations largely of British American and German mis sionaries The Allies at once made attack upon these colonies and in practically every instance the mission ary areas were invaded and the mission stations were occupied by one party or the other and made the base of military activities Great hardship was suffered by some of the missionaries especially the British when invaded by the Germans although the German mis sionaries make fully as strong complaint against their treatment at the hands of British and French invaders The German missions were more depleted since German missionaries of military age were called upon to join the fighting forces and in some fields nearly the entire Ger man male missionary body was transferred to the ranks and the mission work was left without much male supervi sion The native Christians too were seriously involved A British war vessel visited a station of one of the Ameri can Mission Boards with direction to take on board theEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 3 American missionaries After due deliberation the mis sionaries replied that as they were at the place of duty and opportunity they had unanimously decided to remain in spite of the friendly offer of the Admiral to carry them to a place of safety The Admiral removed his hat and replied Many a man today wears the Vic toria Cross for acts of heroism far less worthy than that which you exhibit While the missionaries suffered necessarily many hardships no violent deaths have been reported and after the colonies had been entirely over come by the Allies the work settled down to more normal conditions In the Balkan Peninsula an area fought over since 1912 more than any other section of the world mission work has been very little disturbed There are mission stations in the Balkan Peninsula that have been under four different flags in the last six years Monastir for instance was under the Turkish flag in 1912 This flag was replaced by the Bulgarian in the first Balkan war and that by the Serbian flag in the second Balkan war in 1913 and now by the French flag None of the parties taking possession of the country have materially inter fered with missionary work The Bulgarian govern ment was wholly friendly The Serbian government was somewhat suspicious but not hostile Turkey has differed from all others connected with the war because it has experienced atrocities such as the world has seldom before witnessed while at the same time it has been the field of military operations of the first order The war has raged in the west about the Dardanelles in the southeast in Syria and Mesopotamia and in the northeast along the Russian and Persian border From twentyfive to thirty per cent of the missionaries who were there at the outbreak of the war have remained About five per cent of those who re mained have died during this war period most of them4 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW from typhus typhoid and cholera The character of the work was materially changed owing to the unprecedented conditions The Persian situation has differed little from the Turkish except that Persia has been outside of the real war zone although the northern section of the country has been fought over by Russian Turkish and Allied troops and there have been many local disturbances which have at times threatened the life of the mission aries Irresponsible mobs have taken possession of some mission stations as at Tabriz where the Presbyterian Hospital was sacked together with the American Con sulate The missionary enterprise throughout the world has suffered seriously from the loss of manpower Many missionaries recognizing as paramount the call of their country have withdrawn temporarily from missionary service and taken up some form of war work Some of the Mission Boards in Great Britain and Canada have lost in this way more than fifty per cent of their male missionaries of war age So far as reported the American missionary societies have not lost that number but the Mission Boards have taken the position that they would throw no obstacle in the way of any missionary who wished to enter military service The number of new appointees has necessarily been reduced From twenty to thirty is the age when most missionaries are appointed and while theological students and ordained men are exempt from the draft there were many who did not wish to claim this exemption Many Mission Boards are sending out for educational industrial and medical work men who are not ordained and who thus would not be exempt It is an interesting fact that some of these missionaries have been given their release from military service on the ground that the service they contemplated rendering in the mission field was calculated to aidEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 5 materially in winning the war There have been many interesting cases of this character showing the breadth of the Exemption Bbards in their recognition of the work of the foreign missionaries as international agencies working in the interests of international brotherhood and good understanding The German missions have probably suffered more from a loss of manpower than any others because a larger percentage of their missionaries were bound by military regulations to take their place in the ranks whenever their country called for their services It has already been stated that in the German colonies in Africa a large number of the German missionaries joined the military forces This was true of many who were at home on furlough and of others who were deported from their mission fields early in the war At the same time it was impossible for the Mission Boards in Germany to communicate with their mission fields so that mission aries even past the military age who were caught at their homebase could not return and in fact their return was forbidden in all cases where their mission territory came under the flag of a country at war with Germany The effect therefore of the war upon the manpower and support of German missions has been disastrous This condition has attracted the attention of the British and American missionary societies and considerable sums of money have been raised both in Great Britain and the United States to conserve the German work and the Government of India has been most liberal in its treatment of these missions The financial loss of the missions has been great caused by the increased cost of nearly all commodities every where No part of the world is free from the apparently universal advance in the price of foodstuffs labor and of wearing apparel This has compelled the increase of the annual allowance for the support of missionaries6 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW At the same time the cost of transportation both of the missionary and his supplies has more than doubled and to this is to be added the increase of cost of exchange brought about chiefly by the rise in the price of silver As an illustration the year before the war exchange in China went as high as 215 in silver for one dollar gold Since the war began the price has been falling rapidly so that it has reached according to latest reports the unprecedented figure of a little better than one dollar silver for one dollar gold As all payments in China are made in silver this item alone has nearly doubled the expenditure of missionary funds in that country in order to maintain the work upon its former basis The movement of missionaries has been severely ham pered by war conditions Necessarily the Government has been compelled to put new and stringent restrictions upon the issuing of passports since the passport privilege has been abused by representatives of the Central Powers In addition to this Great Britain because of her disastrous experience with German missionaries put re strictions upon the entrance of missionaries from coun tries other than Great Britain into British possessions For instance if a Mission Board wishes to send a mis sionary into India whether he is a new appointee or a veteran returning to his field of labor application for permission must be made through the British Embassy at Washington This application properly vouched for is sent to India through England and after investiga tion in India as well as in the United States if nothing appears against the candidate permission for going to India is granted A passport cannot be secured from the United States government until this permission is obtained This has caused much delay and has also excluded from British colonies many missionaries of German descent Other difficulties have appeared in the form of limited facilities for travel Steamship linesEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 7 have been reduced in number until it has become almost impossible to secure passage for a missionary or mis sionary family to cross either the Atlantic or the Pacific without waiting for several months The northern Atlantic has been closed to missionary travel but the southern Atlantic still remains open while there have been no restrictions upon the Pacific except such as are caused by lack of passenger service II THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON MISSION WORK IN TURKEY AND PERSIA The most striking illustration of the effect of the war upon mission work in Turkey will be discussed under the head of The Effect of the War on the Mohammedan World At the outbreak of the war Turkey was occu pied as a mission field principally by the Presbyterian Board of Missions carrying on extensive work in Syria and Palestine and the American Board of Commission ers for Foreign Missions conducting work across Asia Minor through Armenia and Kurdistan and down into northern Syria This work was established about a century ago and out of it had grown not only a large number of churches but an extensive medical work and educational institutions of national and international repute When missionaries entered the country there was not a vestige of modern education to be found throughout the land It was inevitable that men and women trained in our best American colleges and uni versities should there lay the foundation for a thorough education for all classes The Armenians were the first to respond followed by the Bulgarians of the western part of the country and of Macedonia and then the Greeks the Mohammedans coming last Besides the large number of hospitals under American missionary physicians of the highest standing there have grown up8 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW a long list of notable colleges like the Syrian Protestant College at Beirsit Euphrates College at Harpfit Robert College at Constantinople the American College for Girls at Constantinople the International College at Smyrna Anatolia College at Marsovan Aintab College at Aintab St Pauls Institute at Tarsus Central Turkey College for Girls at Marash and last and perhaps least the American College at Van just beginning its career as a college at the beginning of the war In addition to these colleges were several times their number of pre paratory schools and academies much more widely dis tributed throughout the country At the outbreak of the war in these higher intermediate and primary schools in Turkey directly under the control and direction of Americans most of whom were missionaries there were nearly thirty thousand of the best and brightest young men and women of Turkey receiving a modern educa tion There was some work carried on by British societies in Mesopotamia and in the vicinity of Constantinople and German missionaries for some fifteen years previous to the outbreak of the war had been carrying on limited missionary operations The Germans had been strength ening their missions continuously during the entire period they having begun there after the massacres of Armenians in 18956 and the friendly alliance created by the visit of the Kaiser to Abdul Hamid in 1898 All this work had been established under what are known in the diplomatic world as concessions and capitulations Turkey was loath to make treaties with western Powers it being contrary to the dignity and rights of the Caliph of Islam the Sultan of Turkey thus to bind himself Concessions were made which theoretically at least upon the part of the Sultan might be abrogated at will Under these concessions foreigners were allowed to come into the country missionary work was especially recogEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 9 nized and more or less foreign business had been built up between Turkey and the western nations Missionary medical educational and charitable institutions which had been founded during the last sixty years had been established under privileges granted by these concessions and capitulations Within a month after the war began and before Turkey had actually joined the belligerents the capitulations were abrogated by an official proclamation which diplo matically and legally left no standing whatever for any foreign institution within Turkey There were no laws and no treaties by which foreign property and foreigners themselves could claim protection The proclamation of abrogation demanded that all foreigners and all for eign property should come at once under Turkish law and that foreigners should have no right of appeal to their consuls or ambassadors If these conditions had been immediately and strictly carried out it would have caused the destruction of all missionary work The American ambassador joining with all of the other ambassadors in Turkey including the German made strenuous protest against such a step on the part of Turkey claiming as they had a right to claim that the capitulations and concessions were virtually treaties and that they could not be abrogated without the consent of all parties concerned The decree of abrogation was not carried out in all details Missionaries did appeal to their consuls and to their ambassadors While local officials in some of the interior stations overstepped their rights breaking the seal of American consuls and taking possession of American schools the central Government gradually yielded to the arguments of the ambassadors and issued a series of regulations which were afterward materially modified so that missionary work was not vitally interfered with Much credit is due to Ambas sador Morgenthau for his strenuous and effective protest10 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW with the Turkish officials against any such drastic treat ment of American interests in Turkey At the time the order of abrogation was issued there were from eight to ten million dollars worth of property in Turkey owned by American missionaries and American educational institutions This was in the form of educational medi cal printing industrial and religious plants with their buildings and equipment including the residences of Americans engaged in the conduct of the different forms of work Back of these plants there was a total of in vestment of not less than forty millions of dollars cover ing nearly a century of endeavor in the country Attention was very soon turned from controversy over the abolition of the capitulations to the atrocities which Turkey under the leadership of Germany began to per petrate first against the Armenians and later upon Syrians and Greeks This attack upon the Armenians who comprised the larger part of the student and teach ing force and working Christian body in Asiatic Turkey struck a direct blow at the educational and missionary work Native professors in American colleges teachers pastors leaders and students in the educational insti tutions were seized by the thousands some of them horribly tortured many put to death while others were sent into exile down into Syria and northern Arabia The story of these atrocities is too well known to require repetition here The effect upon educational work in the interior of Turkey was paralyzing as in the College at Aintab Euphrates College at Harpfit and the College at Van Nearly every Armenian teacher was at once eliminated and the older students either taken into the army exiled or killed The missionaries remained on the ground and used their influence as far as they were able to counteract the disastrous effect of this atrocious attack They were recognized as the defenders of the Christian populationsEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 11 against the Government measure of extermination Relief funds were furnished them from the American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief in the United States and from that time to this large numbers of them have given a greater part of their time and strength to the carrying out of measures of relief by the aid of over 5000000 of funds provided from America After the first attack against American institutions and their native constituencies a constantly increasing num ber of Mohammedan officials seemed to begin to realize something of the heinousness of their acts and so con sequently to withdraw their opposition They began to afford the missionaries a measure of cooiperation for instance the Syrian Protestant College at Beirit re ceived much help from Djemal Pasha a former member of the Young Turk Cabinet and later commander of the Fourth Turkish Army Corps that was operating against Egypt and the Allied forces in Syria Through him in the face of difficult food conditions supplies were secured and the College was able to carry on its work with a larger number of students than it has had before in its history This increase of students was partly due to the closing of British and French schools at Beirft and also to the feeling on the part of many parents that the safest place for their children was in the American school This same condition prevailed also in Constantinople and Robert College and the American College for Girls have been overwhelmed with students in spite of the increased cost of living According to latest reports Robert College had more than fifty per cent increase in its student body as did the American College for Girls and Talaat Pasha then Grand Vizier was giving much assistance in obtain ing fuel and food The International College in Smyrna although its president is a British subject has continued its work uninterruptedly It has been compelled to12 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW reduce the number of students it could accept owing to its shortened teaching force and limited finances but the president reports this last year to be one of the most encouraging and promising in the history of the College Institutions in the interior have not fared so well Ana tolia College at Marsovan lost most of its faculty and its student body Only the Greeks remained after the first onslaught on the College Nearly a year before the breaking of diplomatic relations between Turkey and the United States the entire missionary force at Marsovan was removed by the government under military order but later four members of the station were allowed to return and the work for girls was resumed but the boys college has remained closed Euphrates College at Har pfit remained open although no work of college grade was carried on after the first attack This work was suspended when diplomatic relations were broken with the United States It has been impossible for the last two years to send out of the country any detailed reports of the progress of the work but between one and two hundred Americans missionaries and teachers and physicians have remained in the country continuing the educational and medical work as far as possible but devoting themselves prima rily to acting as agents for reaching with measures of relief the starving stricken exiled peoples of that coun try These have remained in spite of the urgent demand of Ambassador Elkus at the time when diplomatic rela tions with the United States were broken that they all should withdraw from the country The State Depart ment even demanded that all Americans should come out but this large company of men and women in spite of the possibility that the United States might soon be at war with Turkey decided to stay where they de clared they believed they could render the largest ser vice to humanity and the world They were consciousEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 13 of the fact that should they withdraw these suffering scores of thousands of people would be left without aid and at the mercy of any one who wished to attack them Many have died during this war period of disease incident to the country Of the missionaries of the American Board alone seven have died of typhus and possibly eight The death of seven others who were not physically strong was undoubtedly hastened by the severe strain upon them One Mrs G C Raynolds died through an accident incurred on the flight of the missionaries from Van preceding its recapture by the Turks Two suffered probably a violent death although the case of Mr George P Knapp a graduate of Harvard University in the class of 1887 might have been a case of typhus The truth will undoubtedly remain a secret Two Presbyterian missionaries in Syria died one of typhus and the other of cholera In Persia the situation has been somewhat similar to that in Turkey although Persia has not been within the actual western war zone Its northern territory has been overrun by both Turkish and Russian troops and the Kurdish element got out of control and added to the terror of the situation Six of the Persian Presby terian missionaries died of typhus and cholera but most of them are there on the ground today administering relief as far as they are able to the starving population of more than one million souls In both Turkey and Persia the fact that missionaries have remained at their posts of service in the midst of peril from disease and in many cases from violence when it was fully known to the authorities and to the Mohammedan populations that they not only had the privilege of withdrawing to their homeland but were even ordered by their govern ment to do so has had a mighty influence on the think ing of the Mohammedans This example of missionary14 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW heroism and devotion never surpassed in the history of Christian missions is leading to most serious thought on the part of Moslems They recognize in this act a vast difference between Islam and Christianity and while they may reject the preaching of the missionaries and declare impracticable many of the demands of the gospel of Christ they cannot deny the fact that these Christian missionaries coming to their country in the name of the Christ have exhibited Him with mighty power in the lives of sacrifice and peril they have lived and in the heroic deaths they have died Through these condi tions a message of surpassing power and influence has been delivered and is still being delivered to the Moslem populations of these two great Mohammedan countries III THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON THE MOHAMMEDAN WORLD There is reason for referring to Mohammedanism as the Mohammedan world although followers of Mohammed are widely scattered among many different peoples speaking various tongues and occupying but a mere fragment of the worlds surface under Mohammedan governments Nevertheless the unity that has pre vailed among Mohammedans in creed practice ideals and expectations no matter what their language or nationality has given ground at least for the expression Also the Mohammedans have presented an organized unified resistance to the Christian approach to such an extent that it has seemed like the resistance of a single body united with one purpose This resistance has been so persistent that the Christian approach to the Moham medans has made but little general progress in the past and the Christianization of the Mohammedans has been almost the despair of missionary organizations MohamEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 15 medanism in extending itself among pagan peoples as in Africa and in propagating its faith among the non Moslem populations among which Mohammedans have dwelt has made much use of the argument that Moham medanism is a unit undivided with a single ideal and purpose more unified than any other religion and ulti mately bound through its unity of creed and effort to win the entire world This was the state of affairs at the outbreak of the war and it was a condition that Germany made deep plans to use in prosecuting the war There is evidence to show that it was Germanys purpose to fire the Mo hammedan world with a mighty jihad that would para lyze civilization The wellknown effort inaugurated through the SheikulIslam and the Sultan of Turkey acting as the Caliph of Islam has passed into history Its failure was a surprise to the entire world bringing con sternation to Germany The alliance of Turkey with socalled Christian Germany and Austria has estranged Turkey as the only existing Mohammedan government of recognized significance from the other great national bodies of Islam India Egypt the North African states and other Mohammedan countries repudiated the alli ance and refused to join in a holy war under Turkeys leadership The result has been the dismemberment of Mohammedanism as a centralized religious force Never since the day of Mohammed has the Mohammedan world been so disrupted disorganized and destitute of religious leadership After the shock of the refusal of the Mohammedans to respond to the call for a holy war the next great cleavage thrust into the very centre of Mohammedanism was the disaffection of the Arabian tribes their repudiation of Turkey and their affiliation with the Allies The chief significance of the separation of Arabia from Turkey lies in the fact that the sacred places of IslamMecca and Medinaare located in16 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Arabia and the Sultan of Turkey for centuries has been recognized as the keeper and protector of these sacred shrines As the direct result of this endeavor of Turkey under German leadership to precipitate a holy war we find that Mohammedanism has lost its Caliph and is now without an accepted religious head The Mohammedans of India Egypt and in fact nearly all parts of the world have either tacitly or officially repudiated the Sultan of Turkey as the Caliph of Islam a position which he has held for four centuries or more This leaves Moham medans without a recognized leader while the Mohamme dans of India and Egypt have declared their loyalty to Great Britain thus breaking the centralized political power of Mohammedanism in addition to its disrupted religious solidarity Arabia under the leadership of the Sherif of Mecca has officially and religiously rejected the Sultan as the Caliph and has assumed absolute control of the sacred shrines of Islam The Sherif has set himself up as the King of the Hedjaz and the legitimate and proper pro tector of Mecca and Medina In his proclamation to the Mohammedan world he severely condemns the Sultan of Turkey as the Caliph of Islam for the action taken in calling a holy war in conjunction with Germany To the present time no Mohammedan country or Moham medan leader has come forward as the defender of the Sultan or his claim upon the Caliphate There is no agreement among the Mohammedans upon a Caliph The law of Mohammedanism would seem to demand that the Caliph shall be the ruler of an inde pendent Mohammedan country as he is supposed to be not only the religious but the political head of his people At the present time the only ruler of what may be called an independent Mohammedan kingdom is the Sherif of Mecca selfproclaimed as the King of the Hedjaz twoEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 17 small provinces in Arabia upon the Red Sea but in which are located Mecca and Medina Whether or not the Mohammedans will recognize the King of the LHedjaz as the Caliph remains to be seen but apart from him there seems to be no available candidate Thus it is apparent that the organic religious and polit ical unity of the Mohammedan world has been shattered so that no longer can Moslems present a united front in opposition to Christianity or of any other religion nor can they exercise political power for intimidating Moham medans who are inclined to turn away from their ancestral faith and consider the contents and claims of Christian ity Already there are indications of a new sense of liberty and freedom in some countries which is but a part of the movement so prevalent in the world today from autocracy toward democracy It indicates a desire and a purpose on the part of many Mohammedans at least to exercise their own judgment and to demand liberty of action in religious matters This state of affairs would seem to open the door of approach for the Christian teacher and preacher more favorably than it has ever been open since the days of Mohammed Mohammedans are beginning to realize that their solidarity is broken that their hope of universal Mohammedan rule over the world is shattered forever Intelligent Mohammedans are recognizing the fact that Mohammedanism does not contain those elements of strength which furnish an adequate religious motive and ideal for any society much less for a State This has brought to them a sense of discouragement and in many places almost of despair for the future of their faith There are many indications that large groups of Moham medans are ready to inquire sincerely and earnestly into the principles of Christianity and what it promises to its followers There has never been a time since Christian ity came into open conflict with Islam when conditions18 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW seemed so favorable for a wise judicious united approach to the Mohammedan world with the message of Chris tianity There are no people who need more the gospel of sanitation of industry of brotherhood of intelligence of sacrifice and of consecration than do the Mohamme dans The task is a colossal one involving the approach to fully oneseventh of this worlds population dwell ing largely within or near the tropics prejudiced and fanatical It is too great for any one communion to undertake it is too important to be undertaken by all communions acting separately There are many who feel and believe that through this war and its effect upon Mohammedanism as well as upon Christianity at home the time has come for a united effort on the part of the Christian world to approach the Mohammedan world in a way that will win their confidence and gradually their cooperation and ultimately their allegiance The most fundamental effect of this war upon the nonChristian world is that of its influence upon Mohammedanism con stituting a new challenge to the Christian Church IV THE EFFECT OF THE WAR UPON THE GERMAN ATTITUDE TOWARDS MOHAMMEDANISM In German colonies in Africa at the outbreak of the war there were less than two million Mohammedans Apart from these colonies German territory had prac tically no Mohammedan population The Christians of Germany were deeply interested in Mohammedan prob lems and in missionary endeavor to reach the people of that faith In 1910 a German Colonial Congress was held in Hamburg in which the Moslem peril in East Africa was seriously discussed After the discussion the Congress adopted the following resolution Since the progress of Islam in our colonies is accompanied by grave perils this Colonial Congress recommends a thorough studyEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 19 of Moslem propagandism The Congress is thoroughly convinced that everything which favors the progress of Islam and hinders the progress of Christianity should be avoided and especially commends the cultural efforts of missionary education and hospital work to the support of the Colonial Government We also recognize in the Moslem peril an urgent challenge to German Christianity to oc cupy the regions threatened by Islam with missionary effort It is an interesting fact that in this conference there were Protestants Roman Catholics and Socialistic lead ers The clearcut utterance of the resolution above quoted does not tally well with the fact that for the last twenty years the Kaiser has made no utterance so far as records show that would in any way offend the most fanatical Mohammedan When the war began it was evident that Germany was putting much reliance upon her relations with Turkey as the central Mohammedan power The German Government went so far as to plan with Turkey for calling a holy war Germany placed much dependence upon the uprising of the two hundred and thirty millions of Mohammedans in a real alliance with Germany thus striking a fatal blow at Great Britain France Italy and Russia each of whom had large Mohammedan populations under its flag England alone ruled over ninetyone millions of Moham medans of which sixtyseven millions were in India Soon after the alliance between Germany and Turkey was established Christian leaders in Germany began to show a different attitude toward Mohammedanism as for instance Professor Friedrich Delitzsch of Berlin who as early as the spring of 1915 in an address to a Berlin audience said Islam so far from being a barren and retrogressive faith leaves the door wide open to religious moral and social progress and therefore no German Christian need be ashamed of an alliance which begun in time of war will be cemented and bear worthy fruit in times of peace20 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW In a lecture delivered in the spring of the same year Professor Wilhelm Hermann of Marburg said We must be convinced that they the Turks understand us and we them Were this not the case our alliance would be a false and unworthy one As Christians we can understand and reverence their religious convictions and our future lies along the same road as theirs After discussing the alliance of Germany with Islam at about the same period Professor Troeltsch said Islam is thereby recognized as one of the great acknowledged religious world powers which can no longer be a missionary objec tive but must be left just as in the Christian world to its own inner religious development It is unlikely that this result will ever be reversed and it will affect the treatment of the Moslem prob lem in our Colonial possessions For all that Christianity is of course not invalidated in the territories occupied by the white race to which apart from the Christian communities in our colonies it seems bound to confine itself though it is limited as regards its world mission It seems to be conclusively established that humanity is distributed into distinct spheres of religious life free henceforth to stimulate one another religiously but each bound to fulfil its own destiny This will astonish or alarm no one who has already come to this conviction on general principles from a study of the history of religion but it is now beginning to be universally evident from the course of historical events These quotations are sufficient to show the trend of thought among many of the religious leaders but they do not represent the sentiment of all the Christian people of Germany MissionsMagazin of which Herr F Wiirz is editor took up the discussion maintaining strongly that the German Government could make no alliance with a religion and that the Christian people of Germany in order to maintain loyalty to their country were not to assume that Mohammedans do not need Christianity In the midst of this discussion Herr Wiirz says Our own share in the gospel of Christ may well be at stake if in the political alliance with the Mohammedan world we lightlyEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 21 esteem the incomparable treasure with which we have been en dowed by God That would mean not the end of the world mission of Christianity but certainly the end of our world mission on behalf of Christianity It may be difficult for us when as a natural conse quence of political alliance the consensus of public opinion is friendly toward Islam to maintain our clear Christian consciousness with regard to that faith But if we do we may bring blessing to the Mohammedan world with which we are now outwardly so closely associated Professor Julius Richter of Berlin editor of the Allge meine Missions Zeitschrift takes up the discussion but not with the same clearness and emphasis as Herr Wtiirz In 1915 there was an assembly of the German Evangelical Missionary Committee to discuss this important ques tion Every German Evangelical Missionary Society was represented Bishop Hennig a member of the Con tinuation Committee of the Edinburgh Missionary Con ference presided One of the most important questions discussed was What Missions may do in order to protect the home Churches from a wrong valuation of Islam So far as is known no resolutions were passed but in reporting this Conference in the Evangelisches MissionsMagazin of June 1916 Herr Schlunk of Ham burg among other things said Wide circles of the German people not only stand in actual danger of placing an incorrect valuation upon the religion of Mo hammed but they have already fundamentally fallen prey to this danger Through a determined admiration of Islam they become equally determined to forget their own Christian position and believe that they are in this way fulfilling their obligation to the German cause If one demands however that the Ottoman king dom should be absolutely excluded from the sphere of missions he seeks thereby to cut the vital nerve of all missionary work and to bring into question the essential superiority of Christianity to the nonChristian religions This question is still under discussion in Germany but not so prominently as in the first year of the war It22 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW will remain to be seen whether when the war is over the Christians of Germany will have reached the con clusion that the Mohammedan world is outside of the sphere of their missionary activity It is not improb able also that Great Britain may feel herself to be under special obligations to Mohammedans and to such a degree that there will be a tendency to put restriction upon missionary work among and for Mohammedans under the British flag The fact that she rules over such a vast Mohammedan population and that the Moham medans exert such a dominant influence especially in India and Egypt will undoubtedly lead many statesmen of Great Britain to raise the question as to whether Christian missionaries should not be excluded from undertaking any direct religious work for Mohammedans in these countries at least if not in all other countries where Mohammedans are found in any considerable number Such an attitude can be taken only under the mistaken supposition that Christian missionaries are a disturbing element when working among Moslems Mis sionary Societies and Boards are eagerly watching the trend of events as they affect the relations of Moslems to the great missionary movement V ENLARGED VISION OF MISSIONS IN RELATION TO THE STATE The war is having a marked effect not only upon the administrative officers and missionaries of foreign mission organizations but also upon the constituency at large by way of giving them all a new conception of the place of foreign missions in establishing throughout Asia and in Africa a civilization in harmony with the twentieth century Christian ideals The old conception that the foreign missionary went out to teach pagan peoples a creed in order to save them from the wrath to come hadEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 23 already become enlarged during the last generation of missionary endeavor to a more balanced conception of the sociological value of Christianity Christian mis sionaries have been for the last two decades attempting scientifically to apply the principles of the gospel of Christ and the teachings of the New Testament to the society of the East and this effort has not been without a large degree of success The war however has brought to the front a new and enlarged phase of the missionary enterprise hardly dreamed of before but now becoming important in the light of presentday questions The missionaries and missionary administrators are recogniz ing that the gospel is not simply for the individual and for society but that it is a gospel suited to the needs of the State We are learning the same lessons also in the West The principles that lie at the foundation of the most stu pendous alliance of nations the world has ever seen are the principles taught in the New Testament These are justice and righteousness in national administration the right of the individual and of the small nation to live and to enjoy a large degree of liberty without fear or favor the principle that the stronger nations are under God the natural protectors of the weaker nations These principles are now at the front in the discussion of war questions and especially of questions looking to a per manent peace yet to be established The discussion has already passed beyond that of the value of the principles of the gospel in the organization and conduct of the affairs of a nation to international relations where nation deals with nation so affecting the permanent peace of the world This conception of international Christianity was perhaps thrust for the first time into diplomatic circles by our own Secretary John Hay when the great powers of Europe set about to partition China He in the name of the United States Govern ment protested against such partitioning This protest94 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW raised a storm of opposition among his fellow diplomats on the ground that diplomacy as between nations must remain always and forever purely selfish The state ment was made that if the United States wished a por tion of China she should put in her claim and defend it but if she did not she had no right to lift her voice in the interests of the integrity of China for Chinas sake It was maintained that such an attitude was unknown in international diplomacy Secretary Hay held his position and saved China from dismemberment The principle however did not seem to reach the inner con sciousness of the national life of the world until the outbreak of the present war The last two years have revealed a marvellous advance in the thinking of the civil ized world upon the sisterhood of nations The world is rapidly learning that when one nation suffers all suffer that when one is prosperous all are prosperous in a pro portionate degree We are learning that no nation or country on earth can remain backward intellectually morally or nationally and not to a degree become a dead weight and even a menace to the other nations of the world This at once brings the whole subject up to the very door of the foreign missionary enterprise There are two illustrations now prominently before the world which may be given as concrete examples of the point under consideration A few years ago China the oldest autocracy on the face of the earth with enormous although undeveloped wealth at her disposal and with a population twice in excess of that of any other nation decided to throw off her autocracy depose her Emperor and establish a con stitutional government This decision was not made hastily but followed extended discussions and long de liberation When the decision was reached it seemed to carry with it practically the entire population of that great empire and China quietly and unostentatiouslyEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 25 swung out from the number of hereditary monarchies into the circle of democracies A constitution was adopted a President was elected by the people parlia ment assembled laws were made for the government of the new republic and all without any untoward disturb ance It is true there were riots in some parts of the empire as there have always been since China has been known to the Western world but no more Foreign relations were not disturbed foreign commerce was not interfered with foreigners dwelling in the country did not regard their lives in peril or their property in jeopardy For half a dozen years China has moved forward under a democratic form of government and only recently has elected a new President without disturbance and appar ently to the entire satisfaction of all of the people As the great war developed China believing in democracy as the form of government best suited to her particular genius joined the Allies and at once became a force in winning this war for world justice righteousness broth erhood and human freedom Her men by the hundreds of thousands have gone to France and are there assisting to the limit of their power in the cause of her allies and she was ready to furnish still larger forces for the achieve ment of victory Another and a more recent illustration of a movement in the same direction is that of Russia She too decided to depose her timehonored monarch and become a demo cratic nation This step was taken as one of the imme diate results of the war The Czar was dethroned amid scenes of riot and bloodshed and almost immediately the greater part of the Russian Empire was thrown into dis order and anarchy reigned from Vladivostok to the North Sea Russia withdrew from the war as a positive force in aid of the cause of the Allies and became an ally of the Central Powers Foreign trade was paralyzed throughout the land The lives of foreigners were im96 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW perilled and their property destroyed no life was secure law and order were abandoned and anarchy ruled Russia became not only no help to the Allies but became a menace to the world One cannot examine these two illustrations of recent events in the national life of two countries which com prise together fully onethird of the worlds total popu lation without raising the question as to what has made the difference between these two great nations moving from an absolute monarchy to a democracy in the same general period We at first might say that it was due largely to the religious and fundamental ideals of the two nations We must remember however that China has always been classed as a pagan nation Her people are largely Confucianists Buddhists and Taoists These religions inculcate gentleness of action and friendliness of spirit At the same time we must remember that Russia was a Christian country controlled by a national Chris tian Church conspicuous among the churches of the world with magnificent cathedrals and a great far reaching powerful church organization It is impossible to find in these two religious principles the reason why the fundamental change was made in one instance in quietness and peace and in the other in riots and disorder If we go back for a century and look into the history of these two countries we find that Christian missionaries entered China at the beginning of the nineteenth century The Bible was translated into the languages of the people Christian institutions were established schools were opened and Western learning was introduced until grad ually Western educational institutions from the kinder garten to the college and university stretched across China from south to north and from the east to the most remote province of the west Chinese young men of the most daring spirit and of the broadest intellect soonEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 27 found their way to the West and took extensive courses of study in the best institutions of America and England Preceding the adoption of the constitution by China she adopted the system of Western learning which had been introduced into her borders by the missionaries It became the education of the Government Through this Western learning in which constitutional govern ment and modern history as well as the principles of Christianity were systematically and thoroughly taught China saw a new light Then when she began to long for a larger liberty in the making of her own laws and the administration of her own affairs it was but natural that the country should turn to the young men who had been educated in mission institutions and in colleges and uni versities in the West to assume places of leadership These men had the confidence of the Chinese The people were ready in a large degree to follow their lead ership and so when word went forth that China was to change her monarchy to a democracy these students of the West and of the constitutional governments of the world were called upon to prepare a constitution which when prepared was accepted and China became free With Russia it was different While the Bible in Russia was freely printed and freely distributed there was no liberty given to the people to study constitutional government and modern history No missionaries were allowed to enter the great Russian Empire and establish modern Christian schools upon the modern Christian basis Russian students who had studied these great subjects abroad were not allowed to return and if per chance any did reenter the country their lives were in peril and in multitudes of cases their liberty was taken from them on the mere supposition that they were sup porters of the doctrine of the rights of the people to have a voice in the making and execution of their own laws28 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW When Russia took the important step towards a demo cracy she had no leaders of adequate training and of safe ideals Those who did assume control had been trained in the school of socialism and anarchy into which the principles of justice and righteousness and brotherhood had not entered It does not require a great stretch of the imagination to picture what might have been the result had Russia at the beginning of the eighteenth century permitted American missionaries men and women of the highest intellectual and spiritual equipment with lofty ideals taught by the gospel of Christ to enter her empire and establish there great outstanding modern educational and religious institutions Then when her hour of crisis came she would have had men and women of moral and intellectual strength and of recognized leadership to lead Russia safely over the bar into the harbor of peace I do not believe it is presumptuous to say that one of the outstanding differences between these two countries in the method and results of their throwing off their mon archy and establishing a constitutional democratic form of government is due in large part if not entirely to the fact that Christian missionaries were given so large op portunity in China to promote those lofty ideals taught by Christ Himself and His disciples and to build them into institutions that have already become a part of Chinas national social and intellectual life and that if they had had the same privileges in Russia for the same period the outcome in Russia would have been wholly different from what it is today Facts of this character are convincing the missionary leaders that the horizon of their vision must be enlarged to include a message to the nations as well as to the individual and to society Much of the teaching in the New Testament in the light of present history not only can be interpreted in terms of the nation but we are rapidly learning that anythingEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 29 short of such an interpretation is a clear misreading of the purpose and order of God VI WORLD DEMOCRACY AND MISSIONS The last twelve years have recorded a rapid advance among the nations of the world from an autocratic to a democratic form of government By democratic form of government we mean a government in which the people have a voice in deciding to what laws they shall be sub ject the method by which these shall be executed and by whom President Wilson has given to the world the declaration that this war is now being fought to make the world safe for democracy Twenty years ago but a small proportion of the worlds population lived under a democratic form of government The monarchy was the rule A hundred years ago democracies were not only the exception but they were looked upon by most of the world as an experiment in government destined to disaster Today more than twenty nations are joined together in a mighty alliance for the protection of demo cracy or in other words for the protection of the rule and rights of the people as against the divine right of kings There have been many instances in history where an autocracy has gone wrong History is full of the records of kings deposed and their successors installed often by violence the only remedy the people had for protection against a rule that was unjust and intolerable This was remotely an expression of the spirit of democracy but however that may be it was a remedy by which an auto crat gone wrong might be prevented from working evil in the world It was the only recognized and known method of reform for an impossible autocrat On the other hand a democracy is the rule of the people It is the people themselves the majority under leadership who decide what form the democracy shall take who30 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW shall guide it and under what laws The success of a democracy depends upon the steadiness and intelligence of the people and upon their being actuated and inspired by the right ideals It is not sufficient that the people shall have ideals Germany was as thoroughly actu ated by ideals as any country on the face of the earth at the outbreak of the war These ideals had been taught to all her citizens from their youth up and had become a part of their inmost thinking but the ideals were low unworthy an intelligent people and when carried into action became a menace to the world We have found that when an autocracy goes wrong there is a remedy but when a democracy goes wrong it becomes a curse to itself and the world While President Wilson announced that this war is being fought to make the world safe for democracy undoubtedly if he were to express his thought on the subject at the present time he would say it was to make democracy safe for itself and for the world The entire world is moving with startling rapidity toward a democratic form of government While Japan main tains a monarchy nevertheless the people of Japan have a large voice and strong influence in shaping Japans national life She has a constitutional government a parliament elected by the people and while the Emperor rules in Japan nevertheless he would indeed be a brave and bold Emperor who would take any step that would run athwart the will and wishes of the people of Japan In the Japanese pressdiscussions upon government plans for internal development or affecting relations with the outside nations one sees nothing as to the opinion of the Emperor upon the subject Japan has already reached that stage where the voice of the people is heard with authority and where the peoples will is becoming the supreme will of the nation We have already referred to China where that vast population having thrown off the rule of the aristocracyEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 31 now come under a government of selfrule and selfdeter mination No words can be found to describe adequately the significance of China democratized or what she may become with her resources of men and material wealth developed and her relations to the Far East touching as she does upon one side the great Russia and the waters that connect Japan with India and on the other side bordering upon the Pacific Ocean over against the United States Chinas place in world progress is one of portent far beyond the power of any prophet now to foresee Coming further west we find India with some 325000 000 of people who have been for more than half a cent ury controlled in most part by England Among this number there are 67000000 Mohammedans in some respects the most virile of the country English rule has been benevolent aiming at the development of the Indian people and their preparation for a measure of selfgov ernment Indias millions watched with profound inter est the conflict between Russia and Japan since they had been brought up to believe that the Asiatic races were naturally subject to the white races of the West When Russia was defeated India got a new conception of the possibility of independence for the Asiatic She began to demand from England a larger measure of selfgovern ment and selfexpression which was freely granted The present war however has carried India an enormous stride forward in selfconsciousness and in her desire for home rule She has furnished more than a million men to Great Britain to fight the war of the West for demo cracy She was ready to furnish more men but at the same time she has obtained a new conception of the possibilities that lie before India in the line of selfgovernment De mands have been made on Great Britain that a larger measure of home rule shall be given India and these de mands are receiving favorable consideration and India willS3 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW soon be making her own laws and choosing those who shall execute them India which only fifty years ago seemed nationally helpless and incapable of selfgovernment be cause of the lack of training and of dissensions among the various races making up her diverse population is now uniting the Hindu and the Mohammedan alike demanding that she have a share and a large share in the mighty democratic movement of the age England has already promised India a large part at least of that for which she is asking We will not refer again to Russia with its 180000000 already broken away from its autocratic government and old traditions and feeling its way blindly toward some form of selfgovernment that shall recognize the rights of the people and grant them power of selfexpression We will not prolong the list but there are other smaller peoples moving in the same direction and countries that retain their monarch but shorn largely of power to rule because of the insistence of the people themselves upon a larger measure of selfrule We have here named four countries which possess about twothirds of the entire population of this world all of which within the last decade have moved with startling rapidity away from an autocratic government into a form of democracy If the movement of all these peoples is actuated by the proper ideals and the laws that they make are based upon the principles of justice righteousness and brotherhood the world will move on speedily and steadily toward that happy day when nations shall dwell together in unity But what will be the result to the world if these thou sand million of the worlds population or any important portion of them should come into a democratic form of government with ideals which will be a menace not only to their own populations but a curse to the rest of the world Under such conditions we can turn only to the God of nations and devoutly call upon Him to have mercyEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 33 upon the world gone wrong and headed for selfdestruc tion It is fundamentally imperative therefore that these nations moving toward democracy should be in spired with ideals which will guarantee safety for themselves their people their immediate neighbors and for the remoter nations that must deal with them in international relations What safeguard therefore can be thrown about this mighty almost universal democratic movement so as to turn a possible curse into the greatest of blessings There will always remain the influence which goes out from the Christian method of dealing with Eastern races but such influences must necessarily be limited The Christian merchant from the West can exert a strong helpful influence upon these people of the East but this influence is hampered by the fact that he goes to the East for personal gain There are those who claim that edu cation will make these nations safe that if Japan China India and Russia will only adopt modern education build up great colleges and universities put a high pre mium upon modern scholarship introduce all the modern sciences teach history and all that goes with it this will make these coming Eastern democratic countries safe for the world There is no denying the fact that a modern education has the greatest value which cannot be over looked when we consider those forces that must be brought to bear upon the East in this critical period of their history At the same time we cannot forget and must not that Germany at the outbreak of this great war was called the besteducated nation on the face of the earth Neither can we escape from the fact that because of her education in every department of science and history Germanys menace to the world has been vastly greater than it otherwise would have been Edu cation has not saved Germany from bringing upon the world the greatest war of history accompanied by atro34 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW cities surpassing those perpetrated by the worst African tribes or the savages of the South Seas forcing the world to make the greatest sacrifice ever made in any equal period of the worlds history Modern education without those ideals that must lie at the base of a safe and just and righteous government as taught by Jesus and his apostles and handed down through the universal Church from age to age can never make safe a nation or a democracy We come then to the inevitable conclusion that it is only the living Church of Christ reaching out into these great countries of the East through its multiform mis sionary agencies and establishing there Christian institu tions of every character and grade that we can implant in the hearts of their leaders who make the laws shape the government and establish international relation ships those principles of righteousness which will make them a blessing and not a curse to the world This is putting upon the Church and the great missionary cause a stupendous and overwhelming responsibility and yet it is one that they cannot evade It is a responsibility that never was dreamed of a generation ago but one that now with all its force thrusts itself to the front To meet this responsibility the Church at home must rally its forces to the last man and the last woman and its resources to the last dollar that it may fulfil its sacred and worldembracing mission This conflict is now ended with the one mighty menace to human liberty crushed and now the Church must take up its task greater and more enduring even than the one for which the Allies fought namely to make through the power of the uni versal gospel committed to it the emerging democracies of the nations safe for themselves and for the world This is the task of the Church revealed to it by this war The fact that foreign missions are the only agencies through which the Church can influence the ideals ambiEFFECT OF THE WAR ON PROTESTANT MISSIONS 35 tions thought and life of the great nations and coming races of Africa and the East for justice righteousness and fraternity removes them from the inferior position in which they have hitherto been classed and gives them a place among the most important worldshaping agencies The most potent energy today operating for international fraternity and world peace is the force that acts through modern foreign missions

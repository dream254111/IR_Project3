ON THE CASE WHEREIN THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR WAS THE PLAINTIFF AND THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR WAS THE DEFENDANT REVERSED THE OPINION STATES THE CASE  REPORTED BY M P BURKS STATE REPORTER812 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MARCH J ALSTON CABELL AND J JORDAN LTAKE FOR THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR R T LACY AND JOHN A LAMB FOR THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR KEITH P DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT THIS WAS AN ACTION OF TRESPASS ON THE CASE BROUGHT BY LINDSAY TO RECOVER DAMAGES FOR AN INJURY SUSTAINED WHILE IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE TRIGG COMPANY IN WHICH THE JURY RENDERED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF SUBJECT TO A DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE THE COURT OVERRULED THE DEMURRER AND GAVE JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFF AND THE CASE IS BEFORE US UPON A WRIT OF ERROR THE CASE PRESENTED IS AS FOLLOWS DONOVAN AND ANOTHER EMPLOYEE WERE ENGAGED IN PUTTING UP SHAFTING AND PULLEYS BY WHICH EMERY WHEELS USED IN THE BUSINESS OF THE TRIGG COMPANY WERE MADE TO REVOLVE THE POWER WAS COMMUNICATED THROUGH LEATHER BELTS WHICH IT WAS THE DUTY OF LINDSAY TO LACE THE SHAFTS THE PULLEYS THE BELT AND THE EMERY WHEELS CONSTITUTING WHEN PLACED IN PROPER RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER A COMPLETED MACHINE WHEN THE POWER WAS APPLIED AND THE MACHINE PUT IN MOTION THE BELT INSTEAD OF RUNNING TRUE MOVED IN A ZIGZAG OR WABBLED AS WE MAY SAY AND LINDSAY WAS DIRECTED TO HOLD A STICK AGAINST THE BELT TO KEEP IT UPON THE PULLEY WHILE A PART OF THE MACHINERY WAS BEING OILED BY REASON OF THE IMPROPER ADJUSTMENT OF THE PULLEYS DUE TO THE IGNORANCE OR CARE LESSNESS OF DONOVAN A SPEED OF MORE THAN 4000 REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE WAS GIVEN TO THE EMERY WHEELS WHILE IT WAS INTENDED THAT THEY SHOULD SUSTAIN AND THEY HAD BEEN TESTED FOR FROM 1500 TO 1600 REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AFTER THE MACHINE WAS PUT IN MOTION ESTIMATED BY THE WITNESSES AT NOT MORE THAN THREE MINUTES TWO OF THE EMERY WHEELS BURST AND A FRAGMENT COMING IN CONTACT WITH LINDSAYS HAND INFLICTED UPON HIM A SEVERE INJURY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE MACHINE WHICH WAS BEING PUT TOGETHER WAS INCOMPLETE UNTIL THE BAND HAD BEEN PROPERLY LACED AND ADJUSTED TO THE PULLEYS THE MACHINE WAS AS INCAPABLE OF USEFUL OPERATION WITHOUT THE BAND AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT THE SHAFT OR PULLEY THIS APPEARS FROM THE EVIDENCE OF SEVERAL OF THE WIT NESSES AND SEEMS TO BE OBVIOUSLY TRUE THE IMPROPER ARRANGE MENT OF THE PULLEYS WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AND THIS RESULTED FROM THE FAULT OF DONOVAN WHO WAS A FELLCWSERVANT OF THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR1903 W R TRIGG CO V LINDSAY 813 AS WAS SAID BY THIS COURT IN DONNELLYS ADMR V RAILROAD CO 88 VA 853 ALL SERVING A COMMON MASTER WORKING UNDER THE SAME CONTROL DERIVING AUTHORITY AND COMPENSATION FROM THE SAME SOURCE AND ENGAGED IN THE SAME GENERAL BUSINESS ALTHOUGH IN DIFFERENT GRADES OR DEPARTMENTS ARE FELLOWSERVANTS AND TAKE THE RISK OF EACH OTHERS NEGLIGENCE THE SAME PRINCIPLE IS ASSERTED IN THE FOLLOWING CASES MORE RE CENTLY DECIDED BY THIS COURT RAILROAD CO V NUCKOLS ADMR 91 VA 193 FORD V LOCOMOTIVE WORKS 94 VA 627 MOORE LIME CO V RICHARDSONS ADMR 95 VA 326 RAILROAD COMPANY V HOUCHINS 95 VA 398 AND RAILROAD CO V MAUZY 98 VA 692 THE BURDEN OF PROVING NEGLIGENCE IN SELECTING OF CONTINUING AN UNFIT SERVANT IS UPON THE PLAINTIFF HE MUST PROVE THE SPECIFIC NEGLIGENT ACT ON WHICH THE ACTION IS FOUNDED WHICH MAY IN SOME CASES BUT NOT GENERALLY BE SUCH AS TO PROVE INCOMPETENCY BUT NEVER CAN OF ITSELF PROVE NOTICE THEREOF TO THE MASTER 1 SHEAR  RED ON NEG SEC 192 DONOVAN HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE TRIGG COMPANY THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF HIS UNFITNESS OR IN CAPACITY TO PERFORM THE DUTIES ASSIGNED HIM EXCEPT THE NEGLIGENT ACT WHICH CAUSED THE INJURY UNDER INVESTIGATION AND OF THAT NEGLI GENCE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE MASTER COULD HAVE HAD NO NOTICE NOR DOES THE EVIDENCE SUPPORT THE CHARGE THAT THE TRIGG COM PANY FAILED IN ITS DUTY TO USE ORDINARY CARE TO PROVIDE REASONABLY SAFE MACHINERY FOR THE USE OF ITS EMPLOYEES THE MACHINE HERE WAS IN PROCESS OF ERECTION IT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AND MADE READY FOR OPERATION THE SEVERAL PERSONS ENGAGED IN PUTTING IT TOGETHER WERE ALL EMPLOYED ABOUT THE SAME BUSINESS PERFORMING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SAME DUTY PERFECTING THE MACHINE WHICH IT WAS THE DUTY OF THE MASTER TO USE ORDINARY CARE TO MAKE REASON ABLY SAFE FOR THOSE WHO WERE TO USE IT WHEN COMPLETED IF THE EMERY WHEELS HAD NOT BURST UNTIL THIS MACHINE HAD BEEN TURNED OVER AND WAS BEING OPERATED AS IT WAS DESIGNED THAT IT SHOULD BE IN DOING ITS PART IN THE WORK OF THE TRIGG COMPANY AND AN EMPLOYEE HAD BEEN INJURED BY REASON OF ITS FAULTY CONSTRUCTION IT MAY BE THAT GROUND WOULD HAVE EXISTED FOR HOLDING THE TRIGG COMPANY LIABLE FOR THE INJURY THE DISTINCTION WHICH WE ARE HERE MAKING IS WELL ILLUSTRATED BY THE CASE OF MURPHY V BOSTON  ALBANY R R CO 88 N Y 146 IN THAT CASE FRANCIS MIURPHY THE PLAINTIFFS INTESTATE WAS ENGAGED814 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MARCH BY THE DIRECTION OF THE MASTER MECHANIC OF THE SHOP IN SETTING THE SAFETY VALVE UPON AN ENGINE WHICH WAS IN THE SHOP FOR REPAIRS SO AS TO ALLOW A PRESSURE IN THE BOILER OF 133 POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST LIMIT OF STEAM PERMITTED IN THE USE OF LOCOMOTIVES ON THAT ROAD WHEN SENT TO THE SHOPS CERTAIN DEFECTS WERE REPORTED BY THE ENGINEER BUT IT WAS A RULE OF THE COM PANY KNOWN TO THE EMPLOYEES THAT NOT ONLY SHOULD THE DEFECTS REPORTED BE REPAIRED BUT AN EXAMINATION SHOULD BE MADE TO SEE IF ANY OTHER DEFECTS COULD BE DISCOVERED AND IF THERE WERE ANY OF A SLIGHT NATURE THEY SHOULD BE REPAIRED FIRST AND REPORTED AFTERWARDS BUT IF OF A SERIOUS NATURE THEY SHOULD BE REPORTED FIRST AND REPAIRED AFTERWARDS THE BOILER IN QUESTION UNDER THE PRESSURE TO WHICH IT WAS SUBJECTED BURST AND AFTER THE EXPLOSION IT WAS FOUND ON EXAMINATION THAT TWENTY OF THE STAYBOLTS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOILER WERE BROKEN THE FRACTURES BEING APPARENTLY OLD AND THE RIGHT SIDE SHEET NEAR THE MUD RING WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY FIVE SIXTEENTHS OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS HAD BEEN WORN DOWN TO ONE SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH THE EVIDENCE TENDED TO SHOW THAT THE EX PLOSION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE DEFECTS WHICH RENDERED THE BOILER INCAPABLE OF SUSTAINING THE PRESSURE DIRECTED TO BE PUT UPON IT AND THAT THE DEFECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY THE BOILER MAKERS IF THEY HAD PERFORMED THEIR DUTY TO MAKE THOROUGH INSPEC TION OF THE BOILER WITH A VIEW TO ASCERTAINING WHETHER ANY DEFECTS EXISTED IN THE TRIAL COURT THE PLAINTIFF WAS NONSUITED AND UPON APPEAL THE COURT SAID THE MASTER DOES NOT GUARANTY EITHER THE COMPETENCY OF THE CO SERVANTS OR THE SAFETY OF THE MACHINERY AND APPLIANCES HE UNDER TAKES TO USE DUE AND REASONABLE CARE IN BOTH RESPECTS AND THAT THERE SHALL BE NO NEGLIGENCE ON HIS PART OR ON THE PART OF ANY PERSON INTRUSTED BY HIM WITH THE BUSINESS OF EMPLOYING SERVANTS AND PROVIDING SAFE MACHINERY ETC IT IS PLAIN THAT THE MASTERS LIA BILITY IF SUSTAINED IN THIS CASE RESTS UPON THE SECOND EXCEPTION STATED VIZ THE NEGLIGENT FURNISHING OF AN UNSAFE MACHINE FOR THE USE OF THE INTESTATE THE COMPETENCY OF THE BOILERMAKERS AND MACHINISTS EMPLOYED IN REPAIRING THE LOCOMOTIVE BEFORE IT CAME TO THE HANDS OF THE INTESTATE AND SMITH IS NOT QUESTIONED THE RULES OF THE SHOP WERE COMPREHENSIVE AND REQUIRED A FULL EXAMINATION BY THE BOILERMAKERS AND MACHINISTS TO DISCOVER DEFECTS THEIR NEGLIGENCE IS NOT A GROUND OF ACTION AGAINST THE MASTER UNLESS AS BETWEEN THE INTESTATE AND THE MASTER IT WAS THE MASTERS DUTY TO1903 W R TRIGG CO V LINDSAY 815 ASCERTAIN BEFORE THE INTESTATE AND SMITH WERE PUT TO SETTING THE VALVE THAT THE BOILER WAS SAFE AND WOULD BEAR THE REQUIRED PRESSURE WE THINK THIS CASE IS NOT WITHIN THE PRINCIPLE WHICH HOLDS THE MASTER RESPONSIBLE FOR UNSAFE MACHINERY FURNISHED FOR THE USE OF THE SERVANT THE CASE OF FULLER V JEWETT 80 N Y 46 IS A DIS TINCT AUTHORITY FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT IF THIS LOCOMOTIVE HAD BEEN SENT OUT FROM THE SHOP AND AFTERWARDS EXPLODED WHILE IN USE ON THE DEFENDANTS ROAD INJURING THE ENGINEER OR OTHER SERVANTS OF THE DEFENDANT THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE BOILERMAKERS IN THE CASE SUPPOSED WOULD BE REGARDED AS THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE MASTER THE RISK OF THE NEGLI GENCE OF THE REPAIRERS AND MACHINISTS WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE RISKS WHICH A SERVANT IN WHOSE HANDS THE MACHINE WAS SUB SEQUENTLY PLACED FOR USE HAD ASSUMED THE PLACING OF THE LOCOMO TIVE ON THE ROAD FOR USE WOULD BE AN ASSURANCE THAT IT WAS FIT AND SAFE AND AN ENGINEER OR OTHER SERVANT EMPLOYED ON THE TRAIN COULD NOT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE KNOWN THE CONDITION OF THE LOCOMO TIVE OR WHETHER THE MEN EMPLOYED TO MAKE REPAIRS WERE COMPETENT OR THE MANNER IN WHICH THE WORK HAD BEEN DONE IN THIS CASE MURPHY WAS NOT WE THINK A SERVANT IN WHOSE HANDS THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS PLACED BY THE DEFENDANT FOR USE WITHIN THE PRINCIPLE OF FULLER V JEWETT AND LIKE CASES THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS SENT TO THE REPAIR SHOP IN ORDER THAT IT MIGHT BE MADE FIT FOR USE THE MECHANICS IN THE REPAIR SHOP INCLUDING THE INTESTATE WERE EMPLOYED FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPAIRING DEFECTIVE LOCOMOTIVES THE INTESTATE AND HIS COLABORERS IN THE SHOP WERE ENGAGED IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT OF SERVICE WORKED UNDER THE SAME CONTROL AND IN THE CASE IN QUESTION THE BOILERMAKERS AND THE OTHER MECHANICS WERE EMPLOYED TO EFFECT THE SAME OBJECT VIZ THE REPARATION OF THE SACRAMENTO IT IS TRUE THAT THE WOIK WAS DONE IN SUCCESSIVE STAGES AND DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORK WERE INTRUSTED TO DIFFERENT PERSONS THE REFITTING OF THE VALVE AND ITS ADJUSTMENT TO THE REQUIRED PRESSURE WERE THE LAST THINGS TO BE DONE THIS WORK WAS HOWEVER AS NECESSARY AS FITTING THE LOCOMOTIVE FOR USE AS THE WORK OF THE BOILERMAKERS OR MACHIN ISTS THE INTESTATE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM HIMSELF OF THE COMPETENCY OF HIS COSERVANTS IN THE SHOP HE DOUBTLESS SUPPOSED THAT THE BOILERMAKERS HAD PERFORMED THEIR DUTY UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAD NEGLECTED IT BUT WE THINK THE RISK OF THEIR NEGLIGENCE WAS ONE OF THE RISKS HE ASSUMED AS INCIDENT TO HIS EMPLOYMENT IN THE COMMON SERVICE IT WOULD BE TOO CLOSE TO A CONSTRUCTION TO816 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MARCH HOLD THAT THE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED WHEN HIS WORK COMMENCED AND THAT THE SETTING OF THE VALVE WAS INDEPENDENT AND DISCONNECTED SERVICE IN RESPECT TO A MACHINE PUT INTO HIS HANDS BY THE COMPANY FOR USE THIS CLAIM OF THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL WOULD MAKE THE MASTER RESPONSIBLE TO EACH SUCCESSIVE EMPLOYEE ENGAGED ON THE REPAIRS FOR ANY NEGLIGENCE OF A COEMPLOYEE WHOSE WORK WAS PRIOR IN POINT OF TIME ALTHOUGH DONE IN EFFECTING THE COMMON PURPOSE IN WHICH ALL WERE ENGAGED THIS WOULD WE THINK BE EXTENDING THE LIABILITY OF THE MASTER FURTHER THAN IS WARRANTED BY THE AD JUDGED CASES WE HAVE QUOTED THUS FULLY FROM THIS CASE BECAUSE IT APTLY ILLUS TRATES THE PRINCIPLES WHICH CONTROL THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION WE DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE TRIGG COM PANY FAILED TO PERFORM ITS DUTY IN THE SELECTION OF SERVANTS OR IN PROVIDING MACHINERY FOR THE USE OF ITS EMPLOYEES AND THE JUDGMENT COMPLAINED OF MUST BE REVERSED REVERSED NOTETHE PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN IN THIS CASE TOUCHING THE LIABILITY OF THE MASTER FOR THE SAFETY OF THE SERVANT HAVE BECOME QUITE FAMILIAR TO VIRGINIA PRACTITIONERS SO OFTEN HAS THE COURT IN RECENT YEARS REITERATED THEM IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THERE SEEMS TO BE NOTHING NOVEL EITHER IN THE PRINCIPLES AN NOUNCED OR IN THEIR APPLICATIONUNLESS THERE BE NOVELTY IN THE OBVIOUSLY SOUND PROPOSITION THAT WHERE SEVERAL SERVANTS ARE ENGAGED IN THE COMMON EMPLOYMENT OF PUTTING UP AND PERFECTING MACHINERY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ONE OF THEM IN ADJUST ING AND TESTING THE MACHINERY WILL NOT BE IMPUTED TO THE MASTER

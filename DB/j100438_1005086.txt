NineKiller,i241956,NO XIII A Letter from Mr JOHN HECKEWELDEER to Dr BAR TON giving fome account of the remarkable inJlinS of a bird called the NineKiller Bethlehem December i8th 1795 Read April AVING an opportunity by a friend of i I796 mine to Philadtlphia I muff mention to you a curious fad that came to my knowledge but yefterday I went to a farm about eleven miles and a half from this place to view a young orchard which had been planted about five weeks ago under my direion where on viewing the trees I found to my great aftonifhment almoft on every one of them one and on fome two and three grafshoppers fluck down on the fharp thorny branches which were not pruned when the trees were planted I immediately called the tenant and afked the reafon and his opinion of this He was much fur prifed at my ignorance about the matter and informed me  that thefe grafshoppers were iluck up by a fmall bird of prey which the Germans called Neuntoedter in EnglifhODF TH E NINEK1LLER 125 Englifli Ninekiller that this bird had a praCtice of catclhing and fickinig up nine grafshoppers a day and that as he well knew they did not devour the grafshoppers nor any other infeds he thought thiey muff do it for pleafiire I afked him for a defcription of this bird and was perfeCtly fatisfied that it lived entirely on finall ani mals fuch as fmall birds mice c for I had paid at tention to this bird as early as the year I76I when in the winter one of the fame fpecies took a favourite little bird out of my cage at the window from wvhich tiine I have watched thein more clofely and have found thenm more numerous in the wefterncountry than here Not being fatisfied with what the tenant had told me re fpeCting the intention of the birds doing all this viz for diverfion fake and particularly obfervilng each and every one of thefe grafshoppers ftuck up fo regularly and in their natural pofition as when on the ground not one of them having its back downwards I began to conje6ture what might be the real intention which the bird had in this and my determined opinion was that this little birdhawk by inftind made ufe of this art in order to decoy the fmaller birds which feed on infes and by thefe means have a fair opportunity of catching them All this I communicated to my friends on my return home and they were not lefs aftonifhed at what I had related to them than I had been on difcovering the faa It being agreed that one or more gentlemen of learning and obfervation hould more nminutely examine into this matter the proprietor of this farm with another gentle man and myfelf went this day out for the purpofe and viewing the grafshoppers on a number of thefe fmall trees fome of which we cut off and took home we returned to the tenant who not only himfelf but alfo his father and filler gave us the befl affurances that they had long fince and from time to time obferved this R bird126 REMARKABLE INSTINCT bird catching grafshoppers and flicking them up in the manner already related and that fometimes they had obferved in places whlere this fpecies of bird keeps numbers of grafshoppers ftuck uip on a thornbufh in like manner The Reverend Mr V Vleck is perfed ly fatisfied that this birdhawk is the Lanius Canaden fis in Bartram  and has obligingly conlmnunicated the following account of this little birdlhawk to me it is extraaed from a German publication printed at Gaettingen in I778 under the title of  Natural Hif tory for Children by M George Chriftian Paff who after giving a defcription of the different fpecies of this bird concludes thus  Why is this bird of prey called the ninekiller Becaufe it is faid to have the habit of iticking beetles or other infeas and perhaps fometimnes nine of them in fucceffion upon thorns that they may not efcape until he has leifure to devour them all at once And for the fame reafon it is fometimes called the thorn flicker Now by the above account we fee that it is known in Europe that this fame fpecies of birds aatually does ftick up infeas of different kinds on thorns c but it is fuppofed they eat them immediately after being ftuck up Here the cafe is quite otherwife They re main ftuck up for we muft fuppofe thefe to have been Ituck up at leaft fome weeks ago and before the hard frofis fet in The very birds as we fuppofe that ftuck them up are now on the fame ground watching the fmaller birds that come out to feed and have been feen catching the latter but a few days ago If it were true that this little hawk had ftuck them up for himfelf how  I do not find that Mr Bartram has mentioned in any part of hs Travel a Lanius Canadenfis Since the date of this letter Mr Hecke welder has favoured me with a wellpreferved fpecimen of the birdhawk It proves to be the Lanius Excubitor of Linnxus the greatfhrike of Mr pennant B S 1B longOF THE NINlEK1LLERR long would he be feeding on one or two hundred grafs hoppers  But if it be intended to feduce the fmaller birds to feed on thefe infetts in order to have an opportunity of catching them that number or even one hlalf or lefs mnay be a good bait all winter and all of us who have confidered thefe circumftances are firmly of opi niion that thefe infeats thus fluck up are to ferve as a bait c through the courfe of the winter You will readily excufe my being fo lengthy oni this fubjeat The matter appeared to me of too much con fequence to pafs over haftily I fhall be glad to hear your opinion on this fubjedc I fend you a few of thefe grafshoppers as I cut them from the trees They being hard and dry moft of their legs broke off in taking them home I am with great refpeat Dear Sir Your moft obedient and Humble fervant JOHN HECKEWELDER

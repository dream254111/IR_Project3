AN OPPORTUNITY BY A FRIEND OF I I796 MINE TO PHILADTLPHIA I MUFF MENTION TO YOU A CURIOUS FAD THAT CAME TO MY KNOWLEDGE BUT YEFTERDAY I WENT TO A FARM ABOUT ELEVEN MILES AND A HALF FROM THIS PLACE TO VIEW A YOUNG ORCHARD WHICH HAD BEEN PLANTED ABOUT FIVE WEEKS AGO UNDER MY DIREION WHERE ON VIEWING THE TREES I FOUND TO MY GREAT AFTONIFHMENT ALMOFT ON EVERY ONE OF THEM ONE AND ON FOME TWO AND THREE GRAFSHOPPERS FLUCK DOWN ON THE FHARP THORNY BRANCHES WHICH WERE NOT PRUNED WHEN THE TREES WERE PLANTED I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE TENANT AND AFKED THE REAFON AND HIS OPINION OF THIS HE WAS MUCH FUR PRIFED AT MY IGNORANCE ABOUT THE MATTER AND INFORMED ME  THAT THEFE GRAFSHOPPERS WERE ILUCK UP BY A FMALL BIRD OF PREY WHICH THE GERMANS CALLED NEUNTOEDTER IN ENGLIFHODF TH E NINEK1LLER 125 ENGLIFLI NINEKILLER THAT THIS BIRD HAD A PRACTICE OF CATCLHING AND FICKINIG UP NINE GRAFSHOPPERS A DAY AND THAT AS HE WELL KNEW THEY DID NOT DEVOUR THE GRAFSHOPPERS NOR ANY OTHER INFEDS HE THOUGHT THIEY MUFF DO IT FOR PLEAFIIRE I AFKED HIM FOR A DEFCRIPTION OF THIS BIRD AND WAS PERFECTLY FATISFIED THAT IT LIVED ENTIRELY ON FINALL ANI MALS FUCH AS FMALL BIRDS MICE C FOR I HAD PAID AT TENTION TO THIS BIRD AS EARLY AS THE YEAR I76I WHEN IN THE WINTER ONE OF THE FAME FPECIES TOOK A FAVOURITE LITTLE BIRD OUT OF MY CAGE AT THE WINDOW FROM WVHICH TIINE I HAVE WATCHED THEIN MORE CLOFELY AND HAVE FOUND THENM

OBFERVILNG EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEFE GRAFSHOPPERS FTUCK UP FO REGULARLY AND IN THEIR NATURAL POFITION AS WHEN ON THE GROUND NOT ONE OF THEM HAVING ITS BACK DOWNWARDS I BEGAN TO CONJE6TURE WHAT MIGHT BE THE REAL INTENTION WHICH THE BIRD HAD IN THIS AND MY DETERMINED OPINION WAS THAT THIS LITTLE BIRDHAWK BY INFTIND MADE UFE OF THIS ART IN ORDER TO DECOY THE FMALLER BIRDS WHICH FEED ON INFES AND BY THEFE MEANS HAVE A FAIR OPPORTUNITY OF CATCHING THEM ALL THIS I COMMUNICATED TO MY FRIENDS ON MY RETURN HOME AND THEY WERE NOT LEFS AFTONIFHED AT WHAT I HAD RELATED TO THEM THAN I HAD BEEN ON DIFCOVERING THE FAA IT BEING AGREED THAT ONE OR MORE GENTLEMEN OF LEARNING AND OBFERVATION HOULD MORE NMINUTELY EXAMINE INTO THIS MATTER THE PROPRIETOR OF THIS FARM WITH ANOTHER GENTLE MAN AND MYFELF WENT THIS DAY OUT FOR THE PURPOFE AND VIEWING THE GRAFSHOPPERS ON A NUMBER OF THEFE FMALL TREES FOME OF WHICH WE CUT OFF AND TOOK HOME WE RETURNED TO THE TENANT WHO NOT ONLY HIMFELF BUT ALFO HIS FATHER AND FILLER GAVE US THE BEFL AFFURANCES THAT THEY HAD LONG FINCE AND FROM TIME TO TIME OBFERVED THIS R BIRD126 REMARKABLE INSTINCT BIRD CATCHING GRAFSHOPPERS AND FLICKING THEM UP IN THE MANNER

Intestines of Birds By James Macartney Esq F R S Read March 21 1811 EVERY author who has written upon the incubation of the egg except LEVEILLE has admitted the existence of a direct communication between the yolk bag and the small intestine of the chick to which the name has been sometimes given of Ductus Vitellointestinalis It was likewise known to STENON NEEDHAM and MAiTRE JAN that this duct remains in the form of a small coecum during life but I do not find that any anatomist was acquainted with the great size that this part possesses in particular species or its internal structure and uses in the adult bird I was led to examine this process more attentively than it had been by others in consequence of meeting with it in the snipe in which bird it surpasses in length the coeca of the great intestines The appendix has an uniform structure in all the birds I have inspected for it There appear to be but two tunics the external is tile continuation of the peritonaeum the internal of the villous coat of the intestine The inner surface of the intestines exhibits different appearances according to the spe cies In some it furnishes fine villous processes in others zigzag or waving laminae which produce a texture to the naked eye like that of twilled cloth but whatever may be MDCCCXI L 18 Mr MACARTNEYS Account of an Appencix the arrangement of the internal coat of the intestine the ap pendix is constantly found to present a surface composed of small cells similar to those assemblages of mucous follicles that are met with in different parts of the alimentary canal I have not observed in any instance that the appendix received the natural contents of the adjoining intestine but have always found it filled with a mucous fluid I therefore conclude that it performs the office of a mucous gland The magnitude and form of the appendix are not so deter mined as its structure In the snipe as already mentioned it exceeds in length the coeca of the great intestines its width also is equal to that portion of the gut from which it arises but it becomes smaller towards the extremity In the curlew I have found it of a very considerable size although less in proportion to the intestine than in the snipe It is wider in the middle than at its origin or termination In the woodcock it is nearly as capacious as in the curlew I have found it very slender but above an inch long in the black coot In this bird the intestines are all long and slender and the coeca of the great intestines singularly so The appendix in the swan and goose is rather larger than in birds generally and ends in a point It is remarkably small in the heron In a great number of the passerine and gallinaceous birds that I have examined for the purpose I have found it very small It is short also in the hawk The greater size which this process of the intestine pre serves in the snipe curlew and woodcock would seem to depend upon the mode of feeding and habits of those birdsto the small Intestines of Birds although I do not perceive in what manner this peculiarity of structure becomes useful to them The aependix in most birds retains the marks of its origin thus the remnant of the yolk bag is commonly found attached to its free extremity with which it still preserves a communi cation This occurs particularly in the passerine tribe and amongst the accipitres In the nightingale the duct is so short that it is scarcely visible but the yolk bag remains during life about the size of a small pea adhering to the intestine with which it communicates The preceding facts furnish a curious example of the oeco nomy of nature in adapting an organ of fcetal life to the exercise of a particular function in the full grown bird They likewise affbrd a proof that the yolk bag and intes tine not only have communicated but that they were originally continuous structures a fact which has been lately denied by LEVEILLE At a future period I hope to lay before the Society some observations upon the functions of the different parts of the egg during incubation from which it will be found that a communication between the yolk bag and intestines exists as a matter of necessity L1 2 2590Mr MACARTNEYS Account c EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURES Fig i Represents a considerable portion of theintestinal canal of the snipe in order to show the relative size of the appendix in that bird a Indicates the small intestine b The great intestine or rectum c Is the appendix on which may be seen even upon the external surface the marks of the cellular structure At the extremity of the appendix the remnant of the yolk bag may be perceived d Shows the two coeca of the great intestine which are shorter in this bird than the appendix Fig 2 Is a short portion of the small intestine with the ap pendix in the curlew a Is the intestine laid open to exhibit the plicated or twilled appearance of the villous coat which is a common structure in birds b The appendix opened also to expose the cellular surface internally c Is the remnant of the yolk N B This figure represents the parts perhaps a little larger than natural owing to the drawing being made from a preparation in spirits but the proportion between the ap pendix and intestine are nevertheless correct 26oIi os fis MDCC CzXTIcZa ml p 4 I  4            2  K   a A  IC 1

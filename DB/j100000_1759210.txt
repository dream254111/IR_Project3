thousand ways can b kept for more than a few days fermenting and s oiling they are the despair of the economists In this decomposition the sub stance becomes filled w ith an immense number of very minute organisms How can a liquid like milk or soup free from all fo eign germs become invaded in a few hours by these innumerable legions of mi crobes  The first hypo lhesis suggested is that all these organisms are the result of the decomposition and that they are produi ed spontaneously at the ex pense of the altered sustance This is the theory 1 By Dr I FOL of Genev  Translated from the Jouzrnal de Geneve IVCG VOL III No 52 of spontaneous generation so vigorously maintained by Pouchet and it is certainly one of the greatest of Mr Pasteurs good offices that he has refuted one by one the arguments of the supporters of this attrac tive theory pursued them to their last defence with his invincible logic and his unexceptionable experi ments The fermentation is produced by the microbes and these by a wonderfully rapid propagation are derived from germs carried by the air or adhering to the vessels which hold the fermentable liquids The dili gent researches of Mr Miquel show that the com paratively pure air of the suburbs of Paris holds from a hundred and fifty to a thousand living germs per cubic metre In a hospital at the centre of the capital each cubic metre of air contains from five thousand to thirty thousand according to the season Although these figures appear prodigious they are nevertheless very small compared to the number of spores which cling to all the solid objects surrounding us A simple cleansing is powerless to remove them only fire or strong antiseptic solu tions can destroy them A fermentable liquid can be preserved indefinitely if it is protected from all microbes but it is easily seen after what we have just said how difficult it must be to obtain this per fectly insulated state All these lower vegetable types are found in two forns  1 the vegetative or active form and 2 the passive form that is the spores which play here a part analogous to that of seeds in plants In the active state most microbes show little en durance many species cannot stand a drying of any duration and in moisture a temperature of 70 to S0 C continued for two or three hours destroys them almost without exception Spores are more hardy boiling water does not kill them but for this purpose water must be heated to 120 130 and even 150 When dry the spores do not succumb to a temperature below 180 to 200 and according to Mr Fricz cold of 110 has no effect upon them To disinfect clothing without burning would then be an impossibility if fortunately Mr Koch had not discovered that the germs cannot resist the action of a continued current of steam at a temperature of 100 It is peculiarly difficult to protect a liquid from all germs or to destroy all those which have penetrated it however it is possible and the liquid is then said to be barren Certain soups are prepared in this way that they may be sown with very small particles of substances containing the microbes to be studied and thus the desired species obtained to the exclu sion of every other Laboratories devoted to these studies annually distribute hundreds and thousands of litres of these soups The organisms which here claim our attention be long to three families all allied to fungi moulds yeasts and microbes proper Each kind of fermen tation is produced by a certain species of these small organisms and takes place only if the species in question is present in the liquid fronm the beginning of the fermentation in sufficient numbers not to be rv IL l IFEBRUARY 1 1884 seCI choked by other species Thus the mycoderm of wine is found in abundance in the flower of the bit ter grape and is naturally scattered in the must which flows from the press In Japan the vine grows with wonderful rapidity and bears magnificent grapes but the mycoderm is lacking and the fermentation pro duced by the other microbes yields only an undrink able liquid The bakers and brewers know very well how to introduce into their dough and must the species needed Without microbes milk would not curdle cheese and vinegar would be unknown the vegetable debris would not decompose and there would be no loam Some one has calculated that a gram of soil contains a million of these little crea tures We are so accustomed to associate the word microbes  with the most dreaded diseases that we lose sight of the important part they play in nature We can confidently say that their suppression would completely overthrow the present order of things The power of causing fermentations is certainly one of the most curious phenomena which these lower vegetable types present This power belongs only to certain species Mr Pasteur was the first to discover that certain microbes live in the air and breathe like animals these do not produce fermentation Others live only when protected from the air and cause fer mentation in the matter which contains them To these two classes there has recently been added a third amphibious microbes simply vegetating while in the air and producing fermentations only when the air is withdrawn Fermentation thus seems to be a kind of respiration The yeasts decompose liquids in order to obtain products rich in oxygen which take the place with them of respirable air These facts are highly important in explaining the mechanisml of diseases In short from a practical point of view we may divide microbes into three classes those which are useful those which seem to have no effect and those which are positively harmful We have already men tioned the first class the second are very numerous for to say nothing of the many species which inhabit all the recesses of nature and concern us only very indirectly we undoubtedly support quantities of them in the cavities of the surface of our bodies and of our digestive canal Nothing equals the astonishment and confusion of very solicitous persons when by a turn of the hand the micrograph shows them all the various forms which live at their expense They are all kinds from the harmless Spirillum in the saliva to the Leptothrix which is the most active agent in the decay of teeth But all this is on the surface the interior of our bodies is completely free from them and it may be said that in our organization every means is taken to defend the entrance to the organs from ordinary microbes and to remove them if they succeed in forcing entry There is how ever a certain number of species which have the sad privilege of being able to penetrate and support themselves in the body of a subject predisposed to receive them The microbe of septaecemia enters only through an open wound while those of tu berculosis and leprosy attack directly the lungs or NCE 129 mucous memibranes of the persons afflicted The surfaces of the lungs and of the alimentary canal seem to be the customary points of attack for the organisms which cause various infectious diseases Our organization is like that of a civilized nation whose citizens are represented by our cells The skin becomes broken the wall of China discloses a breach and immediately there are hordes of savage microbes which enter at strife with the national sol diers our cellular tissues The microbes multiply and scatter around a poisonous liquid the cells com bine and try to starve their dreaded enemies and to repair the breach The battlefield is small but the victory is warmly contested and the sight has its ex citing aspect The result of the struggle depends on the number of combatants and on the energy of the competing forces The antiseptic treatment of wounds as at present skilfully used by Professors Julliard and Reverdin and Dr A Reverdin aims to reduce as much as possible the number of microbes which enter and to retard their development for no one familiar with the subject would think it possible to entirely exclude them How interesting it would be to trace the events of the contest between the organism and its invaders in the case of an epidemic disease Science we hope will soon be in condition to give us this history The diseases which have been traced with certainty to parasites are as yet few in number they may be counted on the fingers To discover the nature of a disease there must be a uniformity of experiments and evidence of which the public and even the ma jority of specialists take no account Nothing is easier than to examine with a microscope small parts of the various organs of a dead body and attribute the fatal disease to the microbes found under these circumstances These wouldbe discoveries soon disproved have only the effect of causing the public to mistrust useful investigations and cast undeserved discredit on serious work performed in the most methodical mlanner To know a parasitic disease it is not enough to have seen the pathogenic microbe it must have been removed from the other microbes and cultivated through a long series of generations in sterilized soups animals must be inoculated at various times with these pure types and each time all the symptoms of the disease whose cause is sought must be observed In this way Mr Koch has re vealed the microbes of charbon and tuberculosis and these discoveries have been granted to science after being examined by a number of investigators among them Professor dEspine Long and very careful cultivation was necessary to show after Dr Hal tenhoffs interesting paper on this subject that the juice of the jequirity owes its extremely virulent properties only to the microbes which it contains We know quite satisfactorily the organisms which produce leprosy erysipelas and symptomatic char bon but for diphtheria typhus intermittent fevers and many other diseases the agents are still undis covered Intermittent fevers afford a good example of how easily errors arise and spread They were at first and130 SCOIE without sufficient evidence said to be caused by the palms  comparativel3 high vegetable types per fectly innocent of the crime of which they were accused Late investig Ations point to a bacterium of elongated forrm as tie cause but the proofs are still insufficient To le rn to recognize the enemy is certainly the most necessary thing to be done but it is only half the task Le must then learn to resist it The more or less effective means of combat which have been employed up to the present tine have aimed 1 to prev nt the dissemination of dan gerous microbes 2 tc make the organism unsuit able for the propagation of the intruders 3 to retard as far as possibli the growth of those which have entered in order t give the organs opportunity to throw them off 1 he first of these measures engrosses the attention of the hygienists hospitals quarantines and disinf ctants are among the means employed I will not tnter upon a subject which touches so many disput d questions but will confine myself to noticing certa n facts and to rectifying cer tain very widespread rrors Regarding infection the nose is a poor guide for the experiments of Mr Miquel show very distinctly that substances in a state of putrefaction se long as they are moist do not emit living germs  he water of the Paris sewers holds eighty million miirobes per litre and yet the air of the sewers contaiirs only eight hundred or nine hundred germs per cubi metre about onetenth the number found in a hospi al By inoculating a rabbit it was shown that these germs are perfectly harm less The moist earth does not give out living organ isms to the atmosphere On the contrary the dust of our rooms which we dc not at all mistrust shows about two millions of tihese living germs per gram The bacteria of intermitent fevers which vegetate in the soil of the Romal Campagna begin to spread in the air and to becon e dangerous only when the soil dried by a scorching sun is raised by the wind in the form of dust It would be easy to multiply ex amples and to prove ti at in point of hygiene we must be guided by sens rather than by smell We have as yet but begun his kind of study for how does this total number 3f germs which the air or water holds interest us  We would prefer to know the number of dangerolts germs The proportions would doubtless be very different from those which concise analysis affords Until we are better in ormed we shall do well to push cleanliness to an extreme and especially to put little trust in disinfei tion The number of sub tances which are less in urious to man than to mi croparasites is very smai The best disinfectant is perfectly useless if too Aeak a dose be used For each of these substance there is one proportion which will destroy the rerms and another which will arrest their vegetat on but not destroy them This last dose is the one ith which we are generally obliged to content ourse ves The experiments of Air Koch and Mr Miq Lel show that the narcotic effect begins to be effect ive on microbes only when the substance in which tl ey are vegetating contains among a thousand parts 5 parts of alcohol or 70 of NCE VOL III No 52 borax or 10 of salicylate of soda or 32 of phenic acid or 5 of quinine or 06 of bromine or 007 of bichloride of mercury or 005 of oxygenated water Certain of the substances indicated are useful in these doses while others as bromine are impracti cable But especially let us not forget that the result is not a radical disinfection it is merely a momentary weakening Is it still needful to insist on the use lessness of too mild doses  We are constantly seeing phenic acid used at less than one in a thousand parts with the sole effect of creating a mistaken sense of security Let me mention another almost unknown antiseptic essence of terebinthine according to Mr Koch arrests the vegetation of microbes in a dose of 7 a0 a quantity easily endured by man All these hygienic precautions are bristling with difficulties How convenient it would be to let the microbes live and to protect our bodies from their influence Unfortunately we know but one way to effect this it is based on a remark made long ago that certain diseases can be retaken only after many years and that this freedom mnay be obtained by con tracting the disease in a very mild form This is the principle of vaccination and also of inoculation em ployed by Mr Pasteur on certain animals The mat ter inoculated contains the microbe of the disease from which we wish to protect the subject but modi fied by a special cultivation it is a virus weakened according to the methods of Mr Toussaint and Mr Pasteur We touch here upon a question at present much contested in regard to the regularity of specific forms of these very low vegetable types Mr Zopf and the school of Munich believe that the most harmless species can under certain circumstances be changed into dangerous ones and vice versa The school of Berlin thinks that artificial modifica tions are only transient and momentary and that the species may be considered invariable However this may be it is certain that if the inoculations of Mr Pasteur have no great practical importance in their present form they at least have a considerable theoretical value We may hope that the time will come when it will be possible to vaccinate for all dis eases which can seldom be taken a second time Who knows if it will not end by discovering the na ture of the influence which the parasitic invasion exerts on the tissues of our bodies and in obtaining the same result in a more direct way without inocu lation  When we consider the progress of science in the last half of the present century we venture no longer to answer Imnpossible THE WATERPORES OF THE LAMELLI BRANCH FOOT IN 1817 Cuvier showed that in Aplysia there was a closed vascular system and claimed the same for all Mollusca His view was followed till 1845 when Valenciennes and others described in many lamelli branchs pores which passed through the foot to intro duce water into the lacunar tissue where the blood circulates This view found general acceptance and

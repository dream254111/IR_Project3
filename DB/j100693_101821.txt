CAVA COMMUNICATED BY EDW TYSON A M AND MS OXON THE ANATOMIE OF MORBID BODIES AS DR HARVEY HATH OB SERVED IS MOST INSTRUCTIVE THEREBY WE ARE ACQUAINTED NOT ONLY WITH THE MANY CAUSES THAT OPPRESS NATURE BUT LIKEWISE WITH THE LIBERTY SHE OFTEN TAKES IN FORMING THE PARTS DIFFERENT FROM HER USUAL RULE OUR PRESENT SUBJECT AFFORDS BOTH FOR ON SEPTEMBER 14TH 1678 OPENING THE BODY OF A REVEREND AND WORTHY CLERGYMAN OF THIS CITY WHERE WERE 6 U PRESENT1036 PRESENT LIKEWISE DR PAGET DR MORTON DR WITTIE DR DAREL C WE OBSERVED THE LIVER TO BE VERY LARGE AND FAST NED TO THE DIAPHRAGM MORE THEN USUALLY THE GOLON SO FIRMLY JOYNED TO THE LIVER NEAR THE GALLBLADDER THAT I COULD NOT SEPARATE IT WITHOUT INCISION THE GIBBOUS PART OF THE LIVER TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE APPEARED DISCOLOURED WHERE MAKING AN INCISION THERE PLENTIFULLY ISSUED OUT A PERFECT PUS VERY FAETID AS LIKEWISE THERE DID FROM A WOUND I MADE IN ITS CA VOUS PART NEAR THE FISSURE THIS PURULENT MATTER I FOUND NOT CONTAINED IN ANY PARTICULAR CYSTIS OR BAG BUT INSEVERAL SINUSS IN THAT PART OF THE LIVER WHEREAS THE OTHER PARTS SEEMED SOUND AND WELL COLOURED NOR DID I MEET WITH ANY WHERE ANY TUBERCULES GLANDULES OR SCHIRRHUS THIS ABFCESS MAY WELL BE PRESUMED THE CAUSE OF THAT LURK ING FEAVER THAT TOOK OFF THE PATIENT HE LABOURING UNDER IT ABOUT SIX WEEKS YET WITHOUT MUCH COMPLAINTS OF SICKNESS BUT TROUBLED WITH IRREGULAR HEATS YET SOMETIMES SUCH AS WERE INPERCEPTIBLE TO HIMSELF TWICE OR THRICE BUT AT GREAT DISTAN CES HE HAD PAROXYSMS OF CHILL FITS LIKE AN INTERMITTENT FEA VOR BUT SUCH A FAETOR AND DRYNESS IN HIS THROAT AS PROVED OB STINATE TO ALL MEDICINES HIS APPROACHING DEATH WAS ATTEND ED WITH OTHER SYMPTOMS THAT USUALLY FOLLOW THE AFFECTION OF THE BRAIN AND GENUS NERVOSUM FORMERLY HE HAD BEEN OFTEN SUBJECT TO THE YELLOW JAUNDICE AND TIS WELL WORTH THE EN QUIRY WHY AT PRESENT NOTHING THEREOF APPEARED SINCE THE GALL BLADDER WAS NOT ONLY FILLED AND CRAMMED WITH STONES BUT LIKEWISE THE MEATUS CYSTICUS AND DUCTUS COMMUNIS EVEN TO THE DUODENUM WERE VERY MUCH EXTENDED WITH THEM AS LIKE WISE IN THE PORUS BILARIUS I MET WITH SEVERAL SMALL ONES THERE WAS NO FLUID GALL CONTAINED IN THE BLADDER BUT SOME THAT WAS SOFT OF A DEEP YELLOW OCHRE COLOUR THAT FILLED UP THE INTER STICES OF THE STONES THESE STONES WERE OF A VARIOUS BIGNESS FROM THAT OF A LARGE NUTOR NUTMEGTO A PEPPER CORN THEIR CO LOUR WAS OF A DARKISH YELLOW OCHRE ALTHOUGH IN SOME THERE AP PEARED LAMINAE OF A BROWNER COLOUR TO THE TOUCH WHEN A LITTLE DRYTHEY SEEMED SOAPY THEIR WEIGHT WAS LIGHTAND THEIR SCENT VERY FETID RESEMBLING THAT OF THE PURULENT MATTER IN THE LI VER THEIR CONSISTENCE WAS FRIABLE THEIR FIGURE FOR THE MOST PART TRIANGULAR OR INCLINING TO THAT FIGURE BUT ALL ANGU LAR THAT SIDE TOWARDS THE GALL BAG WAS PROTUBERANT AND CON VEX1037 VEX THE OTHER TWO SIDES WERE FLATSO THAT HAVING THE LESSER ANGLE TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE CAVITY OF THE GALL BAG LIKE SO MANY WEDGES THEY MORE COMPLEATLY FILLED IT I NUMBRED I THINK ABOVE THIRTY WHETHER THEIR TRIANGULAR FIGURE BE FROM THE SHOOTING OF ANY SALTS IN THE GALL OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSES TIS HARD TO DETER MINE BUT I DO SUPPOSE TWILL BE FOUND THAT THEY USUALLY AFFECT THIS FIGURE AS IN SOME OTHERS I HAVE BY ME TAKEN OUT OF THE GALLBLADDER OF A WOMAN AT OXON SOME YEARS AGO DO MORE PLAINLY APPEAR WHICH ARE ALSO LIGHT DO FEEL SOAPY CONSIST OF LAMINAE ARE OF A WHITISH COLOUR NOT ILL SCENTED AS THE FORMER AND OF A TRIANGULAR FIGURE OUR ENQUIRY THUS FAR HAD INFORMED US OF THE CAUSE OF THE PATIENTS DEATH AS WELL AS OF HIS FORMER ILLNESS AND FREQUENT DISPOSITION TO THE JAUNDICE BUT PROSECUTING OUR SEARCH WE WERE MORE SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THE UNUSUAL STRUCTURE AND CON JUNCTION OF BOTH KIDNEYS THE PARENCHYMA OF THE ONE BEING CONTINUED OVER THE SPINE UNTO THE OTHER SO THAT THEY BOTH MADE BUT ONE CONTINUED SEMILUNARY BODY THIS ALTHOUGH RARE YET HATH BEEN SOMETIMES OBSERVED BY FORMER AUTHORS SCHENCKIUS MENTIONETH FROMCASPERWOLPHIUS THAT RONDELETIUS FOR MERLY OBSERVED BUT ONE KIDNEY IN AN HUMANE BODY QUI FORMA LUNARI ERAT AMBO NIMIRUM SIMUL CONJUNCTI CASPAR BAUHINUS IN HIS THEATR ANATOM HATH GIVEN A FIGURE OF SUCH A KIDNEY BUT THAT WHICH BARTHOLIN DESCRIBES IN HIST ANATOM CENT 2 HIST 77COMES MUCH NEARER OUR SUBJECTALTHOUGH IN SEVERAL PARTICU LARS DIFFERENT AS WILL APPEAR BY HIS CUT THERE OR AS TIS AD DED BY BLASIUS IN HIS APPENDIX TO BELLINUS DE STRUCTURA  USU RENUM THE KIDNEYS HERE WERE LARGE THAT PART THAT CONJOYNETH THEM AND LAY OVER THE SPINE WAS SOMETHING LESSER THEN THE TRUE KIDNEYS AND IN ITS OUTWARD TUNICLE OR MEMBRANE HAD THREE SEAMS ALTHOUGH THAT PARENCHYMA INWARDLY SEEMED NOT TO OB SERVE SUCH A DIVISION BUT WAS THE SAME WITH THE SUBSTANCE OF THE KIDNEYS THE EMULGENT VESSELS WERE VERY NUMEROUS FOR BESIDES TWO LARGER VEINS THAT WERE SUBDIVIDED INTO SEVERAL LESSER RAMIFICATIONS THERE WERE DIVERS OTHER THAT WERE SINGLE EVEN TO THEIR INSERTION INTO THE VENA CAVA THE MIDDLE PART LIKEWISE BY WHICH BOTH KIDNEYS WERE CONJOYNED WAS PLEN 6 U 2 TIFULLY1038 TIFULLY PROVIDED WITH BLOOD VESSELS FOR IT RECEIVED FROM THE AORTA TWO ARTERIES WHICH BEFORE THEIR INSERTION WERE EACH SUBDIVIDED INTO THREE BRANCHES AND IT SENT OUT TWO VEINS WHICH BEING JOYNED AFTERWARD INTO ONE ENTERED THE VENA CAVA BESIDES AT THE SEAM AT THE LOWER PART OF THE  KIDNEY IT HAD A VEIN AND ARTERY WHICH AFTERWARDS INSERTE THEMSELVES INTO THE ILIAC BRANCHES OF THE AORTA AND CAVA S THAT NATURE THOUGH ERRING FROM HER WONTED RULE IN  THIS PART YET WAS PROVIDENT IN FURNISHING IT WITH VESSELS BUT TO THE WHOLE COMPAGES OF THE KIDNEYS THERE BE LONGED ONLY TWO URETERSBUT THE GREAT DILATATION OF THE PELVIS IN EACH WAS REMARKABLE FOR THAT OF THE LEFT KIDNEY WHEN BLOWN UP WAS LARGER THEN IT IS REPRESENTED IN THE FIGURE AND HAD A TRIPLE ORIGINATION THE RIGHT HAD BUT A SINGLE ONE AND WAS LESS WHETHER THIS CONFORMATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEYS AND ITS VESSELS WERE OF MUCH INCONVENIENCE TO THE PATIENT I SHALL NOT DEFINE BUT AM APT TO THINK THAT IT MIGHT OCCASION AS WELL THE GREAT DILATATION OF THE VENA CAVA AS ALSO OF THE PELVIS FOR THE MIDDLE PART CONJOYNING BOTH THE KIDNEYS LYING OVER THE VENA CAVA BY ITS WEIGHT PRESSING THEREON WOULD HINDER THE FREE RETURN OF THE BLOOD WHICH YET WOULD MAKE ROOM FOR ITS SELF BY ENLARGING ITS OWN CHANNEL WHICH WAS SO CAPACIOUS AS TO CONTAIN THREE OR FOUR OF MY FINGERS SO LIKEWISE THE URE TERS RUNNING OVER THAT PART THAT CONJOYNS THE KIDNEYS LIKE STRINGS OVER THE BRIDGE OF A VIOL IN SOME POSITION OF THE BODY THEY MIGHT HAVE THEIR PASSAGE SO STREIGHTNED THAT THE URIN BE ING IMPEDED AND REGURGITATING MIGHT SWELL AND STRETCH THE

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108981, ON THE CHEMICAL INTENSITY OF TOTAL DAYLIGHT AT KEW AND PAR 1865 1866 AND 1867 ,I207022, 555 1 XVII ON THE CHEMICAL INTENSITY OF TOTAL BAYLIGHT AT KEW AND PARA 1865 1866 AND 1867 BY HENRY E ROSCOE FS RECEIVED MAY 14READ JUNE 20 1867 PART ITIE KEW OBSERVATIONS IN THE YEAR 1864 I COMMUNICATED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE DESCRIPTION OF A METHOD FOR THE METEOROLOGICAL REGISTRATION OF THE CHEMICAL INTENSITY OF TOTAL DAYLIGHT FOUNDED UPON AN EXACT MEASUREMENT OF THE TINT WHICH STANDARD SENSITIVE PAPER ASSUMES WHEN EXPOSED FOR A GIVEN TIME TO THE ACTION OF DAYLIGHT DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS MEASUREMENTS OF THE CHEMICAL INTENSITY ACCORDING TO THIS PLAN HAVE THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF DR BALFOUR STEWART BEEN MADE REGULARLY EVERY DAY AT THE KEW OBSERVATORY BY MR T W BAKER AND THUS THE PRACTICABILITY OF CARRYING OUT A CONTINUED SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS ACCORDING TO THIS METHOD HAS BEEN EFFECTUALLY AND SATISFACTORILY TESTED OWING TO THE PRESS OF REGULAR WORK AT THE OBSERVATORY ONLY THREE SEPARATE REGISTRA TIONS OF CHEMICAL INTENSITY COULD BE MADE AT DIFFERENT HOURS EACH DAY HENCE THE RESULTS OBTAINED DO NOT IN ANY WAY INDICATE THE HOURLY VARIATION OF CHEMICAL INTENSITY NOR CAN EVEN THE INDIVIDUAL INTEGRALS OF DAILY INTENSITY GIVING THE MEAN CHEMICAL ACTION EACH DAY BE SAID TO DO MORE THAN EXHIBIT APPROXIMATELY THE CHANGES WHICH GO ON FROM DAY TO DAY THE MONTHLY INTEGRALS ON THE OTHER HAND EACH CALCULATED FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS SHOW WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF ACCURACY THE RISE AND FALL OF THE CHEMICAL INTENSITY WITH THE CHANGING SEASONS OF THE YEAR AND ENABLE US TO DEDUCE FROM THIS THE FIRST SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS OF THE KIND THE MEAN MONTHLY AND YEARLY CHEMICAL INTENSITIES AT KEW FOR 1865 1866 AND 1867 THE HOURS AT WHICH THE CHEMICAL INTENSITY WAS REGISTERED EACH DAY WERE THOSE CHOSEN FOR THE READING OF THE METEOROLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS VIZ 911 30M AM 211 30N PM AND 4X 30M PM THE CONDITION OF THE SUNS SURFACE AS REOARDS FREEDOM FROM CLOUD THE AMOUNT OF THE CLOUD THE TEMPERATURE WET AND DRY BULB AND THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE WERE ALSO NOTED AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE RESULTS

THE RELATION AS LOW AS 8 OF ALTITUDE AND THIS IS TO BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT THE OBSERVATIONS AT HEIDELBERG WERE MADE AT AN ELEVATION OF 1900 FEET ABOVE THE SEALEVEL AND THEREFORE AT A SITUATION

ALTITUDE BEING THE SAME IN BOTH CASES THE CURVE FIG 8 PLATE XXII EXHIBITS THE BIENNIAL VARIATION OF CHEMICAL INTENSITY AT KEW FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDING APRIL 1 1867 THE YEARLY INTEGRAL FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS JANUARYMARCH 1867 AND APRILDECEMBER 1865 IS 557 WHILST THAT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS OF 1866 IS 547 THE MARKED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CHEMICAL INTENSITIES IN SPRING AND AUTUMN MUST BE CAUSED BY CORRESPONDING DIFFERENCES EITHER IN THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD OR IN THE TRANS PARENCY OF THE ATMOSPHERE FROM TABLE IV P 561 IT IS SEEN THAT THE MEAN AMOUNT OF CLOUD IN MARCH 1867 AND APRIL 1865 IS 5 9 AND THAT IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 1865 47 WHILST THE MEAN CLOUD FOR MARCH AND APRIL 1866 IS 5 9 AND THAT FOR THE COR RESPONDING AUTUMN MONTHS6 8 IF THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS MADE WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BE COMPARED WITH THOSE MADE WHEN THE SUNS SURFACE IS OBSCURED BY CLOUDS IT IS SEEN THAT OF SIXTYNINE OBSERVATIONS MADE IN APRIL 1865 THE PROPORTION BETWEEN CLOUD AND SUNSHINE WAS AS 1 TO 1 9 WHEREAS IN THE MONTHS OF AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER OUT OF 130 OBSERVATIONS THE PROPORTION BETWEEN CLOUD AND SUNSHINE WAS 1 TO 21 IN 1866 OUT OF 123 SPRING OBSERVATIONS THE RELATION IS 1 CLOUD TO 0 55 SUNSHINE AND OUT OF 122 AUTUMN OBSERVATIONS THE RELATION WAS FOUND TO BE 1 CLOUD TO 0 60 SUNSHINE HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE EFFECT OF VARYING AMOUNT OF CLOUD HAS BEEN ELIMINATED BY THE NUMBER OF THE OBSERVATIONS AND THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN CHEMICAL INTENSITY CANNOT BE ASCRIBED TO THE PRESENCE OF MORE CLOUD IN THE SPRING THAN INL THE AUTUMN THE ONLY OTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS TO BE SOUGHT IN THE DIFFERENCE IN ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPARENCY IN SPRING AND AUTUMN AND THE ONLY INDICATION WHICH WE AT PRESENT POSSESS OF SUCH VARIATION IN TRANSPARENCY IS AFFORDED BY MEASUREMENTS OF THE HYGROMETRIC CON DITION OF THE AIR THE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY OF MOIST AIR FOR THE VISIBLE RAYS BEING WELL KNOWN IN MARCH 1867 AND APRIL 1865 THE MEAN AMOUNT OF MOISTURE WAS FOUND TO BE 282 GRAINS PER CUBIC FOOT IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 1865 IT WAS 465 GRAINS IN MARCH AND APRIL 1866 THE MOISTURE WAS 28 GRAINS AND IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 421 GRAINS THIS GIVES A RELATION OF 1 TO 1A65 FOR SPRING AND AUTUMN MOISTURE 1865 AND 1 TO P150TOTAL DAYLIGHT AT KEW AND PAIRA 563 FOR THE SAME IN 1866 ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR AS INFLUENCING THE TRANSPARENCY MUST NOT BE OVERLOOKED VIZ THE PRESENCE OF FINELY DIVIDED SOLID PARTICLES WHICH FLOATING ABOUT PRODUCE THE PHENOMENON OF ATMOSPHERIC OPALESCENCE THIS TAKEN IN CONNEXION WITH THE WELL KNOWN FACT OF THE GREATER VELOCITY OF THE WINDS IN SPRING THAN IN AUTUMN THUS INCREASING THE QUANTITY OF THESE FLOATING PARTICLES IN THE SPRING POINTS TO AN EXPLANATION OF THE HIGH AUTUMNAL AND LOW VERNAL CHEMICAL INTENSITY PART ILTEE PARA OGBSERVATIONS OUR KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE CHEMICALLY ACTIVE RAYS ON THE EARTHS SURFACE IS AS YET VERY LIMITED AND ANY CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE INTENSITY OF THE CHEMICAL RAYS IN THE TROPICS HAVE BEEN UP TO THE PRESENT TIME BASED UPON THE VAGUE AND UNSATISFACTORY STATEMENTS OF PHOTOGRAPHERS ACCORDING TO PHOTOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS IT WOULD APPEAR THAT IN ADVANCING FROM ENGLAND TOWARDS THE EQUATOR THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING GOOD PICTURES IS INCREASED AND MORE TIME IS SAID TO BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT UPON A SENSITIVE FILM UNDER THE FULL BLAZE OF A TROPICAL SUN THAN IN THE GLOOMIER ATMOSPHERE OF LONDON IT IS LIKEWISE STATEDT THAT IN MEXICO WHERE THE LIGHT IS VERY INTENSE FROM TWENTY MINUTES TO HALF AN HOUR WAS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE PHO TOGRAPHIC EFFECTS WHICH IN ENGLAND OCCUPY BUT A MINUTE AND IT IS SAID THAT TRAVELLERS ENGAGED IN COPYING THE ANTIQUITIES OF YUCATAN HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ABANDONED THE USE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERA AND TAKEN TO THEIR SKETCHBOOKS DR DRAPER HAS ALSO NOTICED CERTAIN DIFFERENCES OF A SIMILAR KIND BETWEEN THE LIGHT OF NEW YORK AND THAT OF VIRGINIA AND HENCE A SUPPOSITION HAS BEEN THROWN OUT OF THE EXISTENCE OF A PECULIAR RETARDING ACTION EXERTED BY THE LUMINOUS AND THE CALORIFIC RAYS UPON THE MORE REFRANGIBLE AND CHEMICALLY ACTIVE PORTION OF THE SUNLIGHT IN ORDER TO TEST THE VALIDITY OF THESE STATEMENTS IT BECOMES A MATTER OF GREAT INTEREST TO DETERMINE DIRECTLY THE INTENSITY OF THE CHEMICALLY ACTIVE RAYS IN THE TROPICS THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF MESSRS ALFRED BOOTH AND CO OF LIVERPOOL AND THANKS TO THE ZEAL AND ABILITY OF MY ASSISTANT MR T E THORPE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH A SET OF MEASUREMENTS MADE AT PARA SITUATED NEARLY UNDER THE EQUATOR IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCE OF THE BRAZILS AND LYING UPON A BRANCH OF THE AMAZONS IN LONGITUDE 480 30 WEST AND LATITUDE 10 28 SOUTH THE OBSERVATIONS THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE GIVEN BELOW WERE MADE AT PARA BY MR THORPE FROM THE 4TH TO THE 26TH OF APRIL 1866 IN A SITUATION POSSESSING A CLEAR HORIZON OWING TO THE RAINY SEASON HAVING SET IN WHEN THE EXPERIMENTS WERE COMMENCED THE CHANGES IN THE CHEMICAL INTENSITY AS OBSERVED FROM HOUR TO HOUR AND EVEN FROM MINUTE TO

INTENSITY OF DAYS OF APRIL 18TH 23RD 25TH AND 26TH THE CURVES FOR THESE DAYS COMPARED WITH THE DOTTED LINES BELOW INDICATING THE CORRESPONDING ACTION AT KEW SHOW THE ENORMOUS VARIATION IN CHEMICAL INTENSITY WHICH OCCURS UNDER A TROPICAL SUN IN THE RAINY SEASON REGULARLY EVERY AFTERNOON AND SOMETIMES AT OTHER HOURS OF THE DAY ENORMOUS THUNDER CLOUDS OBSCURE THE SUN AND DISCHARGING THEIR CONTENTS IN THE FORM OF DELUGING RAIN REDUCE THE CHEMICAL ACTION NEARLY TO ZERO THE STORM QUICKLY PASSES OVER AND THE CHEMICAL INTENSITY RAPIDLY RISES TO ITS NORMAL VALUE IF WE COMPARE THE DAILY MEAN INTENSITIES AT PARA AND KEW ON THE SAME DAYS WE GAIN SOME IDEA OF THE TRUE CHEMICAL ACTION OF THE TROPICS AND IT BECOMES AT ONCE EVIDENT THAT THE ALLEGED FAILURE OF PHOTOGRAPHERS CANNOT AT ANY RATE BE ASCRIBED TO A DIMINUTION IN THE SUNS CHEMICAL INTENSITY BUT MUST RATHER BE REFERRED EITHER TO OVEREXPOSURE OF THE PLATE OR MORE PROBABLY TO THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING A DISTINCT IMAGE OWING TO

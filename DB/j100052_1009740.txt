recent decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York is a severe blow to the rapid transit projects of the commissioners appointed under the Rapid Transit Act of 1891 The act provided for the appointment of a commission to consist of eight members in every city having one million inhabitants This board was given power to fill any vacancies that might occur It was made the duty of the board to determine the advisability of constructing a rapid transit system If the board should come to an affirmative conclusion it is given power to determine the route and the general plan of construction A copy of these plans must be transmitted to the common council and approved by the latter by a twothirds vote and also by the mayor After obtaining the approval of the local authorities the board is required to obtain the consent of the property owners along the line of the route If such consent cannot be obtained the board may make application to the general term of the Supreme Court for the appointment of three commissioners to determine and report after due hearing whether such railway ought to be constructed A favorable report of the commissioners if approved by the Supreme Court may be taken in lieu of the consent of the property owners Acting under its authority the commission first attempted in 1891 to obtain from the existing elevated railway companies the exten sions and other facilities necessary to secure rapid transit The companies refused to comply with the requirements of the commis sion in making such extensions In November 1894 the people of the city voted for the municipal construction of a rapid transit system The act of I891 was amended in 1895 giving to the com mission additional power The commission immediately prepared plans for an underground railroad secured the approval of the local authorities and of the commission appointed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court In May 1896 however the Appellate Division refused to confirm the report of the commission The objection of the court was based mainly upon the uncertainty of the amount requisite for the construction of the road Further more the loan necessary for the construction of the subway would 2741NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 139 probably have carried the city beyond the constitutional limits of its borrowing power Early in 1897 the commission prepared a second plan which was approved by the local authorities In July of that year another commission was appointed by the Supreme Court which in October of last year unanimously approved the plan In a decision just handed down the court approves of the report of the commissioners but prescribes such additional conditions as to make the execution of the work practically impossible Section 34 of the Rapid Transit Act requires that the individual or corporation con structing the road for the city should file a penalty bond with sureties to double the amount of the bond The court requires that this bond be fixed at not less than 15oooooo which would mean providing for joint and several sureties to the amount of 30000000 Furthermore the court requires that the bond of 15ooo000000ooo be provided for a period of fifty years in other words not only for the period of construction but also for the period of lease of the operating company A committee of the commission in a report issued on January 13 1898 criticises the decision of the court maintaining that the Rapid Transit Act does not contemplate a bond beyond the period of con struction If a bond for 15oooooo to continue for fifty years were required says the committee the obligation of the con tractor by way of security would be first to deposit the ioooooo second to advance from time to time the cost of construction until he was repaid by the city third to submit to the with holding of percentages until complete construction and equipment fourth to provide for the first lien to the city on an equipment worth between 6ooocoo and iooooooo and fifth to provide sureties to the extent of thirty million dollars for a period of fifty years  The contractor must then return to the city in rental its expenditure for construction with the interest thereon and at the end of the lease absolutely surrender the railway to the city The city no doubt ought to make such a bargain if such a bargain be possible but in the opinion of your com mittee it is under municipal and business conditions now existing or in prospect obviously and absolutely impossible If there be a contractor who can meet these requirements he would find it far more to his advantage to build the railroad himself assuming all its risks and enjoying its ownership  In conclusion the committee states that the maximum amount of security that can be exacted from the contractor at the present time would be a cash de posit of iooo ooo a retention of not less than io per cent of the cost of the work until completion several bonds to secure construction 275140 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY and equipment amounting in all to not more than 7500000 or 25 per cent of the cost of construction and a continuing bond for such an amount as with the citys lien on equipment would be equal to seven years rental  The indications at the present time are that the Supreme Court will refuse to recede from its position in which case the prospect for the construction of an underground railway is very slight indeed The probabilities are that the commission will be com pelled to invite existing elevated railway companies to submit plans for the extension and improvement of the present system Street Cleaning The Commissioner of Street Cleaning Mr George E Waring Jr has just presented a final report of the operations of the Department of Street Cleaning during the three years of the administration of Mayor Strong The report gives evidence of the great progress that has been made in the administra tion of this department in the efficiency of the service and in every thing that pertains to the utilization and effective disposal of refuse material While the cost of the department to the city has materially increased the increase has been largely due to the improvement in the plant and in repairs to the equipment made necessary by the failure of the preceding administration to keep the plant in good order One of the most striking results has been the utilization of waste products Of the 8ooooo loads of domestic ashes per annum equal to 1200ooo cubic yards 20 per cent repre sents unused coal easily recoverable This means some 144000 tons for which the city receives something like 36oooo and other products such as fine ash clinker etc would yield a little over 30oooo although the latter has not as yet been so utilized In the other branches of the Street Cleaning Department similar advances have been made The method of unloading garbage on tidewaters has been abandoned resulting in far greater cleanliness as well as improved sanitary conditions in many of the coast resorts of Long Island The report contains a great number of cuts illustrating the different processes and changes adopted by the department ChicagoCivil Service Decision The recent decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois on the constitutionality of the Civil Service Law of March 28 1895 has given a strong impetus to the reform movement in that city The law provides that officials whose appointments are subject to the confirmation of the city coun cil and the heads of any principal departments of the city are to be exempt from the provision of the law With the new city administration which came into office last year the interpretation 276NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 141 placed upon such clauses was such as practically to nullify the pro vision of the act The provision in question was so interpreted as to give power to the common council to increase by ordinance the number of officers to be appointed by the mayor subject to the confirmation of the city council and thus to increase the number of exemptions under Section ii of the act Acting under this sup posed power councils proceeded to exempt the assistant superin tendent the inspectors and captains of police from the classified service It is this action which the court declares to be illegal and adds that all ordinances exempting departmental subordinates from the classified service are illegal All positions which are of a lower grade than the chiefs or heads of those departments must be placed in the classified service with this qualification that wher ever at the time the Civil Service Act was passed an office or place of employment was one the appointment to which was to be made by the mayor subject to the confirmation of the city council it is within the exception named in Section II and is excluded from the classified serviceI The effect of this decision will be to prevent further violations of the spirit of Civil Service Law PennsylvaniaStreet Railways The report of the Bureau of Railways which has just been published gives some interesting information as to the development of the street railway system in Pennsylvania During the year ending June 30 1897 the total amount of outstanding capital stock of street railway companies was 1434893o09 the amount of indebtedness 28812430 the amount of current liabilities 84266976 representing a total capitalization of 220 568715 Of this total the street railway corporations themselves own 52 314349 Major Brown the Chief of the Bureau comments at length upon the fact that the compar ison of figures for different years is sure to be misleading as the increase in capitalization does not represent a corresponding growth of the street railway system owing to process of lease merger and consolidation There is a constant tendency to the inflation of capitalization While there have not been many consolidations or mergers in law yet practically there have been a large number of cases where traction companies as authorized by law have leased lines of other street railway corporations upon a nominal rental The stock or a larger portion of the stock of a leased company is assigned to the traction company by stock holders taking in lieu thereof stock of the new company This is practically a consolidation as the stock so held by the traction company of the leased line or lines is of no great value in most 2771142 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY cases there being little or nothing paid in the way of dividend or for rentals There are of course exceptions to this view of the case but if a fair appraisement could be made of the cash value of the 52 314 349 of the stocks and bonds owned by the street railway companies it would be found that the figures would be very much reduced  The great advance of the total capitalization during the last six or eight years is largely due to the fact that when a traction company takes charge of lines by lease merger or consolidation the capitalization of the traction company is made usually two or three times as great as are the combined capital of the companies leased merged or consolidated The report dwells upon the decline of street railway traffic due to the extended use of the bicycle An inquiry conducted in Harrisburg led to the following interesting results Between the hours of seven in the morning and six in the evening it was found that of a total of 6078 persons passing a given point in the cars or on bicycles 4161 or 677 per cent used the latter method of conveyance and but 323 per cent the former That this means a serious inroad upon the receipts of the company requires little demonstration BostonStreet Railway Lines An excellent instance of the value of public control over corporations enjoying public franchises is seen in the recent action of the Massachusetts Board of Railway Commissioners in withholding their approval from a proposed lease of the franchise and property of the West End Street Railway Company to the Boston Elevated Railway Company until the parties thereto had complied with the conditions prescribed by the board Under an act of 1894 as amended in 1897 the Boston Elevated Railway Company was empowered to enter into a lease or contract for the operation of the West End Street Railway Company One clause of the act provided that No such lease or operating contract shall be valid until the terms thereto so far as they relate to the rental or compensation to be paid and to the due and safe transpor tation of the public have been approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners  According to the terms of the lease the Boston Elevated agreed to pay for the property and franchises of the West End Company all expenses interest taxes and charges of every kind and an annual sum of 7500 for the maintenance of the corporate organiza tion of the West End Company and also to pay on each and all of the charges of the preferred and common stock of the West End Company now outstanding or hereafter issued a cash dividend of 8 per cent free of all taxes in each and every year during the term 278NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 143 of ninetynine years from October I 1897 After a careful appraisal of the property of the West End Company and its probable earning capacity the commissioners are led to the conclusion that this is not a reasonable rental charge They clearly see to what ani extent a lease of this kind would hamper the legislature and municipal council in dealing with the rapid transit problem in Boston In permitting a lease of this character to go into effect the city would be deprived of a share in the increasing profits of the street railway traffic As the commissioners say this rental must be paid in full before more than the minimum percentage of compensation tax could accrue to the city or town Whatever the future accepted rate of return hitherto tending downward on capital invested in public service corporations or at whatever rate under private or public ownership or control fresh capital might be forthcoming the rate here fixed would run on until the end of the lease without diminution or power of revisionI The commissioners furthermore objected to the long rental period of ninetynine years In accordance with the suggestions of the com mission the terms of the lease were modified by reducing the stipu lated rental on the West End Company stock from 8 to 7 per cent and by shortening the term of the lease from ninetynine years to twenty four years eight months and nine days In this way the terms of the contract are such as to safeguard the interests of the public while at the same time preventing inflated capitalization of the leasing company which the original lease would have made necessary Report of Rapid 7Transit Commission The third annual report of the Boston Rapid Transit Commission for the year ending August 15 1897 indicates that the original plan of underground transit has nearly reached completion With the termination of this work however the duties of the commission will by no means be ended as recent enactments of the Massachusetts Legislature have placed in its charge a number of additional plans for the extension of the sys tem the completion of which will probably cover several years The portion of the subway system now completed will relieve the congestion of traffic in the central districts of Boston The expense of construction will practically be borne by the railway company leasing the subway although the original outlay was made by the city The agreement which has been entered into with the West End Railway Company the lessee of the subway gives to that company the use of the subway for a period of twenty years This right it may sublet to any other corporation or corporations or may assign all its rights and privileges In return for this grant the company binds itself First to pay a sum equal to 41 per 279144 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY cent of 7o000000 or 41 per cent of the net cost of the subway if such cost shall be less than 7 ooo ooo In no case however is the payment to be less than a sum calculated by charging a toll of five cents for each passage through the subway of a car not exceeding twentyfive feet in length and a proportionately greater charge for cars of greater length second the company is required to equip the subway with tracks wires appliances fixtures machin ery furniture and apparatus third suitably adequately and to the satisfaction of the commission to light the subway and the cars running therein by electrcity or such other nonexplosive illuminant as may be approved by the commission fourth to maintain the subway in good condition and to make all repairs necessary therefor at its sole cost and expense fifth the power to be used for the operation of the railway within the subway and all of the apparatus placed therein is limited to electricity com pressed air or some agent the use of which will not be accom panied by smoke steam or noxious products the use of steam or animals within the subway as a motive power except temporarily in cases of emergency being prohibited sixth advertising within the subway on the walls or otherwise is prohibited The company is permitted however to place and maintain booths of suitable size and character upon each platform for the sale of newspapers maga zines periodicals and books seventh the city reserves the right to place in the subway such wire and apparatus as may be necessary for its police and firealarm service The company is given power to grant to any person or corporation authorized by law the right to use and maintain for purposes other than railway business the wires conduits for wires and pneumatic tubes within the subway It will readily be seen from an examination of the terms of this contract that the interests of the public are carefully safeguarded The short duration of the lease viz twenty years will enable the city to make new and better terms with the company at the expiration of the contract By that time the payments of the company will have been sufficient to meet the annual interest and sinking fund require ments of the bonds that have been issued for the construction of the subway Consolidation of Gas Companies During the last few years the process of consolidation of private corporations performing quasi public service has proceeded at such a rate that at the present time the principle of natural monopoly has fully asserted itself in most of our large cities One of the recent steps in this direction has been the consolidation of the gas companies of Boston through purchase by the New England Gas and Coke Company The price 280NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 145 paid by the latter company was 14ooo ooo This represents however but a part of the actual capitalization as many of the stockholders of companies thus purchased have received stock in the New England Company in exchange for that of the original company Mtayors Address Hon Josiah Quincy was reelected Mayor of Boston in December and delivered his inaugural on Monday January 3 The address included a detailed review of the years municipal activities and contained some novel recommendations looking towards improved methods of government He expresses a strong belief in the desirability and practicability of doing away with nominating conventions for all city offices the regulation of the caucus and its consequent development into a primary election having progressed far enough to make it possible to abolish the political convention altogether and to make municipal nominations come direct from the party voters The next step in electoral reform would logically be to give the voter in his party caucus the right to designate directly instead of indirectly his choice for the party nomination The average results would be better and safer more representative of the popular will and less subject to the intrigues of ward politicians He favored the adoption of the New York City charter clause that provides that every exmayor so long as he remained a resident of the city should be entitled to a seat in the city council and to participate in its discussions but not entitled to a vote With a view to further strengthening the city council and bringing it into closer touch with the great interests of the city a similar right should be conferred upon a representative from each of two important organizations one representing capital and the other labor and each constituted upon the federation plan One of these is the Associated Board of Trade the other the Central Labor Union The mayor recommends the establishment by ordinance of a Public Baths Department to be managed by a commission of seven unpaid members of whom at least two should be women The proposed ordinance provides for full terms of five years and gives the commission full charge of all public baths and public conve nience stations These functions are at present in the hands of the Board of Health In place of the existing Art Commission the mayor recommends the establishment of an art department to consist of five members one each to be named by the trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts the Boston Society of Architects and the Boston Art Clubthe other  Communication of Sylvester Baxter Esq 281146 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY two to be appointed by the mayor and to be either an architect a sculptor or a painter each member to be appointed for five years This board would have the same functions as the present Art Commission and also award commissions for works of art for which city appropriations are made or which are otherwise under control of the city Merchants Municip5al Committee The Merchants Municipal Committee to serve as an advisory body for the mayor which became a feature of the administration at the beginning of Mayor Quincys term two years ago consisted of seven members appointed by each of several representative mercantile associations The mayor has now changed its basis by delegating to the Associated Board of Trade representing all the mercantile bodies the appointment of the seven members A M3unicipal Newspaper In accordance with an intention an nounced in the mayors inaugural a municipal newspaper was established with the beginning of the year It is called the City Record and is the official gazette of the executive departments of the city It is the second newspaper of the kind in this country the city of New York having maintained a similar publication for over twenty years Such municipal publications are not uncommon in Europe The mayor holds that in view of the successful opera tion of the municipal printing plant it seems particularly appropri ate that Boston being equipped to issue such publication without making any contract therefor should adopt this policy The City Record is issued weekly at an estimated cost of not over 5000 a year The paper is edited under the direction of the Board of Munic ipal Statistics Dr Edward M Hartwell the secretary of the board being practically the editor The city departments are supplied with the paper free and citizens may obtain it at five cents a copy or by subscription at 2 a year One of the mayors reasons for establishing the paper is to throw the fullest light of publicity upon all executive actions as a basis for proper public criticism The mayor urges that the publication be provided for by ordinance making it the official gazette of the entire city The verbatim pro ceedings of the city council are now published by contract in one of the daily newspapers and it would save considerable expense to have this publication take place in the City Record The cost of the City Record is borne proportionately by the various de partments Advertisements of the departments and other legal notices are printed at 12Y cents a line The departments furnish for publication each week reports of all meetings of boards all formal action taken by heads of departments a full copy of every 282NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 147 advertisement issued and a summary of all proposals received in response to the same a statement of all awards of contracts and such current statistical matter relative to department operations as appears suitable for regular or occasional publication The plan of the paper includes a record of all executive activities such as messages from the mayor orders ordinances or votes approved or gone into effect without approval notices of all public hearings a summary or full text of important bills affecting the city pending in the legislature and the full text of all laws passed affecting the city official actions of the school committee vital and social statis tics from the Board of Municipal Statistics including official infor mation of the operations of other cities in this country or abroad special communications to the mayor from heads of departments and information for the public from the departments a record of lawsuits affecting the city and of the settlement of claims against the city an outline of principal features of the city finances illustrations of work proposed or executed by any department as may be desirable to give a clear idea of the same activities of the Civil Service Commission concerning the city official information concerning the several metropolitan commissions and actions taken or reports made affecting the city by state commissions and officers The City Record in the few numbers already pub lished proves exceedingly interesting to all students of municipal affairs School Board Reform A scheme for a radical reform in the constitution of the school board has been agreed upon by a number of persons having the welfare of the schools at heart and will be urged upon the present legislature It provides for a complete separation of the legislative and executive functions whose combina tion in one body makes the existing school board so inefficient Under the new plan there would be a school board of twelve members nine of whom are to be elected by the voters three being chosen each year The other three members are to be appointed by the mayor one each year The annual appropriation for school purposes including construction of schoolhouses would be made by the board but kept within a fixed limit determined upon a percentage of taxable valuation All executive work would be performed by the superintendent of schools and his staff all busi ness including purchase of supplies by a business agent Boards of visitors are provided forone of twelve members for the schools in general and a local board of three members for each school district A novel feature is a school faculty composed of a certain number of teachers to meet at regular intervals for 2831148 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY discussion of matters affecting the schools and report to the school committee Franchise for Refrigeration Conduits A franchise has been given to the Eastern Cold Storage Company to lay in certain streets conduits and pipes for refrigeration purposes the company to pay to the city for each of the first three years after the laying of its pipes one per cent of the gross receipts from customers supplied with refrigeration from such pipes and thereafter two per cent of the gross receipts Repair Division The municipal policy of direct purchase of materials and the direct employment of labor under competent technical supervision and executive direction that was successfully put in practice by the Electrical Construction Division of the Public Buildings Department has received further application in the establishment of the Repair Division of the same department In establishing this division the mayor holds that with a small per manent force to be increased whenever special work may require it will be possible to execute all repairing at a saving of expense and at the same time guaranteeing a better quality of work It might even prove desirable to have such a force do some special portions of the work on new buildings or even wholly to construct small buildings The mayor sees very considerable practical ad vantages in having a permanent staff familiar with all of the work of the city instead of distributing such work among a large number of contractors not all of whom are likely to do good work In certain other departments such as the Bridge Division the city already does its own carpentering and painting upon a consid erable scale The Repair Division will do carpentering plumbing painting etc The Architectural Division has general supervision over the Repair Division The mechanics employed are obtained from the civil service commission by requisition The wages and hours of work are those fixed by the unions for first class workmen The mechanics are not permanently employed and they continue on the payroll only while there is work for them The mayor holds that the city should be able not only to save the profit upon mate rials now charged by contractors but to purchase in sufficient quantities to obtain lower prices than small contractors can secure Friends of the direct employment of labor on public works see in this innovation the germ of a regular works or construction depart ment that eventually will do all building for the city San FranciscoCharter After several unsuccessful attempts to avail itself of the home rule provisions of the constitution of Cali fornia San Francisco is about to make another effort in this 284NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 149 direction The constitution provides that in all cities with a popula tion of Ioooo or over the inhabitants may frame their own charter by electing a board of fifteen freeholders to draft the same which draft must be submitted to the people at a special election Previous charters framed in this way have been rejected in San Francisco owing to the fact that the political party in power has always seen reason to oppose them Some time ago the mayor of San Francisco appointed a Committee of One Hundred to con sider the question of a new charter for the city After many months of careful and serious consideration this committee finally agreed upon the outline of such a charter This charter convention nominated fifteen freeholders as candidates for the charter board provided for by the constitution At a recent election the fifteen candidates of the Committee of One Hundred were elected thus assuring the incorporation of the ideas of the Committee of One Hundred in the proposed new charter It remains to be seen how ever whether the fate of this charter will be the same as that of its predecessors FOREIGN CITIES BirminghamPublic Baths The superintendent and engineer of the Birmingham Public Baths have recently issued an exhaustive report on the development of the system in that city Since the beginning of the movement for the establishment of permanent public baths in England in 1851 the city has constructed four large enclosed establishments and two openair baths The total cost has been about a half million of dollars During the fiscal year ending March 1897 401 745 persons madeuse of the facilities offered The total receipts for the same period were 30482 the total expendi ture including interest and sinking fund on the loans for the con struction of the baths amounted to little over 470ooo0 leaving a deficit of 16518 The rather high excess of expenditures over receipts has been due to several causes In the first place the price of first and secondclass baths has been kept at a low figure the former costing 6d the latter 3d with reductions for commutation or club tickets as will be seen from the following table FIRSTCLASS DEPARTMENTS Swimming or Private Teaching Baths Single Tickets with Two Towels    12 Books of xo Tickets for Swimming Bath only               112 Books of

GrenobleMunicipal Restaurant The Department of Labor in a recent Bulletin publishes an interesting account of a municipal restaurant in the city of Grenoble France For a period of over fortyfive years

average nearly 1300 meals are served each  Change of fiscal year to March 3r instead of December 31 286NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 151 day which does not include the food furnished the public and

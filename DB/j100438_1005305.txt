Observations on Nebulce with a Fourteen Feet Reflector made by H L Smith and E P Mason during the year 1839 By E P Mason Read April 17 1840 1 ALTHOUGH a period of nearly fifty years has now elapsed since the re searches of the elder Herschel exposed to us the wide distribution of nebulous matter through the universe we are still almost as ignorant as ever of its nature and intention The same lapse of time that among his extensive lists of double stars has revealed to us the revolution of sun around sun and given us a par tial insight into the internal economy of those remote sidereal systems has been apparently insufficient to discover any changes of a definite clharacter in the nebulke and thereby to inform us at all of their past history the form of their original creation or their future destiny At the same tinme the detection of such clhanges is in the highest degree desirable since no other sources of evidence can be safely relied uponi in these inquiries That the efforts of as tronomers have thus far ended at best in vague and contradictory conjectures is principally attributable to the great difficulty of originally observing and of describing to future observers bodies so shapeless and indeterminate in their forms with the requisite precision For we cannot doubt authorized as we are to extend the laws of gravitation far into the recesses of space that these masses of diffused matter are actually undergoingc vast revolutions in form and constitution The main object of this paper is to inquire how far that minute accuracy which has achieved such signal discoveries in the allied department of the double stars may be introduced into the observation of nebule by vII2 R166 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE modes of examination and description more peculiarly adapted to this end than such as can be employed in general reviews of the heavens The observations which are detailed in this paper are brought forward in illustration of this inquiry 2 It will conduce to a clearer understanding of our object to point out ge nerally and rapidly the distinctions between our own theorv of observation and that commonly adopted It consists not in an extensive review but in confining the attention to a few individuals upon these exercising a long and minute scrutiny during a succession of evenings rendering even the slightest particulars of each nebula as precise as repeated observation and comparison with varied precautions can make them and confirming each more doubtful and less legible of its features by a repetition of suspicions which are of weight in proportion as they accumulate and lastly when practicable correcting by comparison of the judgments of different persons at the same time Thus much for observationfor rendering the idea of the object as perfect as may be in the mind of the observer For the most unimpaired communi cation of this idea or perception the theory of the process adopted is briefly 1st To form an accurate chart of all stars capable of micrometrical measure ment in and around the nebula 2d From these as the greater landmarks to fill in with all the lesser stars down to the minimum visible by estimation which with care need not fall far short of ordinary measurement 3d On this as a foundation to lay down the nebula After this preparation subject to no material distortion except such digression from the original perception of the observer as the difficulties of accurate representation by a shaded ground and subsequent copying and engraving may cause Lastly the process in cludes the adoption of a method of representing nebule intended to remove the formidable and acknowledged difficulties just namned and at the same time to introduce a numerical precision in the manner of expressing on paper their various features thereby transmitting the best impressions of observation with almost unimpaired fidelity and entailing only the necessary defects of original vision It is not supposed that this process as more fully to be illustrated in its application is the best adapted to meet the end in view for greater experi ence and reflection would certainly suggest particular modifications if not ge neral alterations nor is it intended as a description of what has been done in the present instance but rather of what might be done with more time andWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 167 under more favourable circumstances by observers of greater skill and longer practice 3 The observations presented in the following paper are a portion of a series undertaken in the summer of 1839 The range of objects which at that time passed under inspection was considerably more extensive than the present list but many of these were examined in a desultory manner and the rest of those excluded are not favourable specimens of the style of observation which it is intended to exemplify The telescope employed was of the Herschelian con struction with an aperture of twelve inches and a focal length of fourteen feet A short description of its construietion and powers will not be uninteresting and may serve to show what degree of confidence is warranted irL results ob tained by its aid Although much inferior in size and light to some of the gigantic reflectors of the Herschels it yet is entitled to some distinction as the largest telescope on this side of the Atlantic The instrument was first planned and beguni in the summer of 1838 by my friend and classmate Mr H L Smith A tolerably good metal was cast after several failures and the specu lum was finally polished near the close of the summer Mr Smith and Mr Bradley shared the expenses attending the formation of the mirror and erection of the telescope and divided the long labour of grinding the speculum and I united with them in the less tedious task of giving the mirror its final polislh and figure An account of its performance in some of our first rough trials of its figure is furnished in a note on the 174th page of the XXXVth volume of Sillimans American Journal of Science It has since been frequently and perseveringly repolished by Messrs Smith anid Bradley the test objects men tioned in that note however have been about the limit of its separating power 4 The mode of mounting the telescope was similar to Ramages but ruder The base consisted of three beams forming a triangle which revolved on a circular ledge of plank by means of rollers at the angles and which was guided truly in its circuit by a crosspiece through which rose a central bolt firmly driven into the ground From the angles of this base rose three beams meeting at a height of sixteen or seventeen feet from the ground and a rope passed through a pulley fixed at this height and sustained the weight of the upper part of the telescope The lower end containing the speculum rested on a small platform at one of the solid angles of the base and revolved with the frame The quick motion in altitude was by means of the rope just men168 OB3SERVATIONS ON NEBULA tioned which passed down to a windlass at the base while a slow motion was gained by an apparatus very similar to that described and figured in Pearsons Astronomy as attached to Ramages telescopea combination of ropes within the immediate command of the observer In azimuth the whole frame could be wheeled about by a single person and a slower motion was obtained by simply swinging the telescope by the hand which could be done by the ob server in following a star with perfect steadiness At very high altitudes the systemn of ropes was not available but the weight of the upper end of the tele scope was then so little that the observer could grasp the tube in his arms steadying them by contact with the converging beams and carry on his work nearly as well as before This method of directing a large telescope is much ruder in description than in practice A light framework of steps detached from the main frame served to sup port the observer in his elevated situation Against this the tube of the tele scope could be steadied at any moderate elevation by means of a simple con trivance this however was never necessary unless in high winds The tube was at first of wood but was afterwards replaced by sheet iron on account of its superior lightness and portability it was painted outside and inside and protected during bad weather by oilcloth the speculum at such times being taken out 5 It was our intention at first to have availed ourselves of the power and light of this instrument in a meridional review of a portion of the double stars of the younger Herschels catalogue But a short experience convinced us that its large surface was mnuch better adapted to observations on the fainter nebula than its power of separation to the examination of close double stars And an imperfection in the casting which in spite of the most patient endea vours in renewed and frequent polishing seemed to vitiate a portion of the  It is exceedingly difficult to obtain a good casting of so large a speculum The metal in itself is of a composition that presents obstacles of no ordinary difficulty while from the compa rative ignorance and unskilfulness of many of our workmen in this department those facilities are not afforded for overcoming these obstacles whlich scientific interest in Great Britain and the older countries of Europe has conferred For a telescope considerably less in size I have had more than fifty specula cast before I could obtain one free from imperfections and susceptible of a very ex cellent figure In the present case the general figure of the speculum except in the neighbour hood of the flaw I have spoken of seemed to be excellentWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 169 speculum near it although it did not prevent a very perfect definition of the discs of large stars was yet apt to throw around them flitting rays and burrs of light sometimes hiding very close or faint companions By a skilful appli cation of diaphragms these might be so far annihilated as to afford a good separation of such stars as a Corona3 Borealis  Orionis 5t2 Bootis y Virginis X Ophinchi and others of less than I in distance but the loss of light by this mode of proceeding was a serious inconvenience On objects as illdefined as nebule however the full light of the telescope could be employed to the ut most advantage It was not long before a strict scrutiny revealed to us many particulars concerning the nebule of the elder and younger Herschels which it was obvious that they had not noticed anid in some instances spaces of nebu lous matter of great extent contnected with well known nebule but altogether overlooked by former observers These considerations decided the application of the instrumental power we had obtained to this interesting field of inquiry 6 The nebule which are the subjects of the present paper are 1991 2008 2092 and 2093 of Sir J F W Herschlels large catalogue Phil Trans 1833 These are in reality but three since 2092 and 2093 as will be shown in this paper are but parts of one very extensive nebula united by a long irregular band of very faint nebulous mnatter These three nebulwe are among the most interesting objects in the lheavens perhaps with the exception of Nebula Orionis and Nebula Andromedae the most so They are represented in Plates IV VI and VII with the stars in and near them visible in the fourteen feet telescope The number of objects examined is small in order that the utmost accuracy in the delineation of the peculiar features and minutiw of these ne bule attainable by protracted scrutiny might be aimed at This must still be limited by the unavoidable errors of judgment and the power of the tele scope It is hoped however that by this means somethinc has been done to supply in the examination of these nebule the place of measurement in that of double stars and to put in our possession data by which future changes if there be any can be recognised and detected in at least a few of these wonder ful sidereal systems 7 The first intention was to intrust entirely to careful estimation the copy ing of the stars which were to form the groundwork of the nebula since no means of measuirement were then at hand The following is a skietch of the course of procedure adopted in pursuance of this plan The limits of the VII2 S170 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULIE nebula were traced as far as long and close examination could discern them and a rough chart was made of the principal stars within it This preparation was indispensable because in the consequent mapping down of all the visible stars in the nebula it was necessary to use a light out of doors and the object of course became invisible The distance between any two conspicuous stars favourably situated in the nebula was then chosen as a standard of reference anid from this as a base a kind of triangulation was carried out by the eye to all the stars in the neighbourhood and these were successively marked on a sheet of paper at the time their magnitudes were also affixed to each according to a fictitious scale for which a few stars conveniently situated furnished standards of reference as to size A lamp was close at hand whose light could be cut off at pleasure an almost direct comparison was thus instituted between the stars in the field of view and those on paper and corrections made where any distortions in the latter were observable As the work advanced from night to night the reference to the lamp was necessarily less and less direct since a longer exclusion of light was necessary to see the fainter stars Finally the nebula itself was drawn upon the map by the guidance of the stars already copied and although only an occasional and unfrequent reference could be made to a lamp the stars within it had become so familiar by their constant recurrence that the memory could as easily as before retain its estimations of distance and direction until mutual comparison could be made between the map and the heavens The assistance which is rendered to the faithful description of these remark able objects by thus laying a groundwork of stars may be well illustrated by the familiar expedient of artists who divide any complicated engraving which they would copy into a great number of squares their intended sketch occu pying a similar number The stars which are apparently interwoven through out the whole extent of the nebule furnish a set of thickly distributed natural points of reference which truly transferred to the paper are as available as the crosslines of the artist in limiting and fixing the appearance of the future drawing S In nebule of great extent however correctly estimated may be the stars immediately around the standard of reference those in the distant parts of the nebula are liable to suffer from an accumulation of errors of nearly the same kind as that arising in an extended trigonometrical survey But if the placesWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 171 of the larger stars are well settled by fixed instruments there will be far less room for error in estimations which spread as from so many centres over the remaining intervals It was extremely desirable in the present case to ensure accuracy by such a course although it wouild have been preferable had the means existed to have resorted to it in the first instance The opportunity was however fortunately afforded at a late period of this research by the un expected arrival of an excellent micrometer from England belonging to Yale College and adaptable to the ten feet Clarkes telescope in the observatory of the institution I was enabled by the kindness of Professor Olmsted to avail myself of this instrument and during the fall of 1839 took repeated measures in right ascension and declination of so many stars in each nebula as would serve to determine within a very small quantity the places of those which were utterly too faint for any measurement An abstract of these measures is contained in this paper By these means the places of all the stars were brought to such a degree of exactness that it was thought expedient to throw them into the form of catalogues especially as a direct reference could thus be made to any particular star and through it to any portion of each nebula without the necessity of enlcumbering the map witlh multitudes of letters or numbers These catalogues which are contained in Articles 37 38 and 39 will be referred to constantly in this paper and from them the star correspond ing to any number in the catalogues will be easily found on the maps 9 There must be a very considerable though partial dependence after all upon the eye of the observer and the delicacy of its judgments And as in the use of any instrument we feel unsafe and distrustful until aware of its errors and their probable amount so in this kind of estimation by the eye a knowledge of its liability to error is necessary to comnmand the confidence either of the observer or of others in the results obtained by this means To ascer tain the liability of these charts to error from this source I frequently drew a set of triangles upon paper and after estimating their angles and the compara tive lengths of the sides measured the same Fromn the mean of a great num ber of trials I found my average error in such estimations to be less than two degrees upon angles and J or L in comparative distances A fairer allow ance may perhaps result from estimated angles of position and distances of double stars I have a record of a considerable number of such observed on the meridian during the summer of 1838 thirtysix of which are comparable172 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE with standard catalogues The mean error of these estimations in position is 40 in distance 09 of the whole As these estimations were of absolute dis tance and included stars ranginc from i Libram and x Ophinchi to such as were several minutes asunder it may be inferred that the errors of merely relative distance in the drawings will be considerably less A still better test is afforded by the comparison of the starcharts as first copied from the heavens by simple estimation with the projections afforded by later micrometrical measurement The latter were laid over the former and the discordances between the two are given in numbers in Article 34 By taking from that table the mean of the errors of estimation on each star we find that where they were made in the most careful manner their average error in right ascension is about 0s4 and in declination about 62l These were in a space of 20 diameter the spaces included between the settled or standard stars are generally much smaller than this and of course diminish the lia bility to error Although the mean errors named above show that careful esti mations need not in small spaces be in error to so great an amount as 5 or 6 an accuracy not very far from that of actual measurement yet it may be well to add that some portions of the larger nebule were more hurriedly and less accurately observed as explained in Article 34 From all these sources a tolerably correct idea of the probable error of judgment so to speak may be deduced 10 I will here speak of a method that I hit upon for the exact representation of nebulke which has essentially contributed to the accuracy of the accompa nying delineations the one referred to in Article 2 It was first suggested by the method usually adopted for the representation of heights above the sea level on geographical maps by drawing curves which represent horizontal sec tions of hill and valley at successive elevations above the level of the sea that is by lines of equal height and it is the same in its principle It is obvious that if lines be imagined in the field of view winding around through all those portions of a nebula which have exactly equal brightness these lines trans ferred to our chart of stars will give a faithful representation of the nebula and its minutiae and of the suddenness as well as of the amount of transition from one degree of shade to another I cannot better illustrate my idea than by a reference to Plate II the lines of which were transferred directly from the field of view to the paper in this way and will be immediately recognised asWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 173 identical with the nebula of Plate IV The lines marked 5 were traced in the telescope among the stars and imagined to surround all those portions of the nebula which are of uniform brightness and brighter than any other part The first perceptible gradation or diminution of light is bounded by the lines marked 4 and so on successively to the line  which represents the utmost bounds of the visible nebula All these lines were first traced carefully by the eye in their windings among the stars in the field retraced by the pencil upon a map of the stars at hand and finally corrected by repeated and mutual com parison 11 If we suppose in Plate V the faintest perceptible tint to be laid over all the space included within the line 27 and upon that another layer of shade bounded by the line 1 such that the gradation shall be just perceptible and so go on increasing in depth of shade till the last tint laid on within the lines 5 shall represent the brightest portions of the nebula we have at once a repre sentation of h 1991 giving in its fullest perfection the original idea of the observer as formed with the object under his immediate and minute inspection The great errors which are likely to arise in drawing and shading such deli cate objects are done away In the usual mode a slight pressure of the pen cil or even the inequalities of the paper may give a different impression of the particular features of the object from that which the observer intended and where the gradations of shade to be represented are so extremely delicate it cannot go through the process of engraving without still farther suffering in accuracy In the method here proposed these sources of error are annihilated for these lines can be drawn and corrected out of doors with the native object in view and can be transferred to the engraved plate without appreciable alteration 12 In strictness we should further suppose that these tints shade off into each other at their boundary lines or that the lines should be drawn at infi nitesimal intervals from each other as exact theory must require and con formnity with the gradual decrease of light in the objects themselves But in practice it is only necessary to draw the lines so that the spaces betweenl them shall represent the least equal gradations of light visible to the eye as has been  The reference to Sir J F WT Herschels catalogues is here anid elsewhere by means of the small letter Il according to his own notation So also Sh refers to  Herschel and Souths Cata logue 1824 VIT2 T174 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBtJLAE done in Plate V Farther tlhan this of course it would be useless to multiply lines and these express the rate of condensation as well and in much the same way as a series of points distributed at very small equal intervals serve to de termine the curve in which they are situated This method may be designated as a method by lines of equal brightness in analogy with the terms  cotidal lines lirnes of equal magnetic intensity c to which modes of expressing facts it is nearly allied 13 In the double nebula Plate V the southern member of which is the very remarkable and well known nebula divided into three portions by dark rifts and having a triple star in the centre and the northern member one hitherto overlooked and surrounding the bright star in its neighbourhood the lines of equal brightness enable uis to recognise at once particulars such as these that the portion of the trifid marked A suddenly shades off almost to darkness on the side towards the triple star as is indicated by the closeness with which the lines succeed each other while the transition outward is very slow and gradual that the three nuclei of the southern portion running up to shade 5 are perceptibly brighter than that of the northern whose brightest portion is only within the line 4 and others of a similar description It is evident at once that all such particulars concerning a nebula as are expressed in the younger Herschels nomenclature by the terms  gradually  suddenly and  very suddenlybrighter in the middle are indicated in this method by a greater and greater proximity and crowding of the lines while the distinction between such terms as these suddenly brighter and  suddenly much brighterin the middle are marked by a greater number of these lines inter vening in the latter case than the former It will be easy to conceive how all other particulars concerning a nebula except perhaps its resolvability and the like can be at once embodied in the simplest form of diagram at the time of observation 14 The half lines serve to show strongly suspected gradations of shade for instance within the space enclosed by the line 1 the nebula is suspected to brighlten up a little dividing the rift a into two branches Many minute par ticulars are perfectly and readily distinguished at a glance in Plate V but far less easily and definitely in Plate IV And even Plate IV as well as the other shaded drawings owe much of their minute accuracy in the hands of the en graver to drawings similar in design to Plate V They are in fact copiedWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 175 from such by the artist in a way somewhat resembling the imaginary process I have described in Article 11 of laying upon them successive tints of shade 15 It will be observed that but one nebula is represented in the figures by this method of lines It was deemed expedient to adopt at present the com mon mode that the drawings might be better understood The originals by lines however are preserved and are considered more accurate sources of reference 16 I will now proceed to the immediate observations on the nebule only premising that less care was taken to keep records of them in the form of a journal than to embody them in drawings From these drawings the plates accompanying this paper have been principally compiled I regret that I have at hand no notes of Mr Smiths observations distinct from my own and can therefore furnish only such scattered remarks of his as I have happened to re cord at the time This deficiency is of little real consequence since it was the constant practice for each of us to verify the observations of the other Indeed in all cases where there could be any doubt no particular was considered as any thing more than a mere suspicion whose existence had not been fully and independently corroborated by the othiers testimony OBSERVATIONS WITH THE FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 17 Nebula h 1991 1839 July 12Saw the triple nebula in Sagittarius The three clefts which divide it were made out without difficulty although the whole nebula was extremely faint Rather low in the horizon dug 1Observed the trifid nebula of Herschel The double star is certainly not as figured in the Phil Trans 1833 but rather adhering to the left of the three divisions A diagram was made exhibiting this peculiarity The star was not seen triple dug 7 Nebula IV 41 The nebula much brighter than I have seen it before Mr Smith and myself both remarked that the large star 22 immediately adjoining was sur rounded with a very distinct nebula not far inferior in brightness to the trifid It was scarcely to be overlooked and was seen at the first glance into the field Its limits are nearly as great as those of the trifid nebula with which it is nearly or quite in contact On looking over Herschels observations on this nebula it was very evident that this is to be176 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE classed among the Nova although immediately contiguous to one of the most remarkable and frequently observed nebula in the heavens Jug 9Figured some half dozen of the stars of the trifid nebula I see distinctly the star near its centre triple but a ray or burr of light from the larger star nearly obscures the faint companion so that I can scarcely tell whether the difficulty of the small star con sists in its closeness or faintness Estimated distance of AB 10l of AC 5 but the last may easily be in error from the cause just mentioned The triple star is certainly not central but involved in the skirts of the division marked A in the diagram and also is north of the point where the three clefts meet being in the cleft y The division B runs up at the junction towards or into the opposite cleft 3 a little way shading offl at the same time so gradually that at first sight the rift a seems to proceed more directly from the triple star than it really does dug 10Finished figuring the stars in Nebula Trifid There is scarcely a visible star in the nebula above the triple star Figured the nebula There is a peculiarity about the cleft X which had been suspected on the night of the 9th It shelves off suddenly to the north with a pretty well defined boun dary which I can trace nearly up to the star 2 if I mistake not it divides in two leaving an extremely faint nebulosity or fourth portion isolated from the rest Mr S saw the sud den turn of the cleft northwards but could not satisfy himself as to its division into two which must therefore remain uncertain Peculiarities of the lower nebulaThere is a large but indistinct vacancy or gap north or below its central star where the nebula is decidedly less bright while on the left hand of this vacancy is a small portion brighter than the rest of the nebula  I think the va cancy runs up past the central star though narrower thereS In my own observation I think it does not quite reach the central star so that it remains doubtful whether the star in the centre is not somewhat isolated from the surrounding nebula I saw the same appear ance described by Mr Smith but considered it the effect of the brightness of the star in effacing the impression of the nebula in its immediate neighbourhood Our estimates of the utmost extent of the lower nebula nearly agreed although its boundary was very indefinite dug 14The nebula IV 41 again examined the moon at first troublesome but setting I tried this evening a plan for better delineating this nebula by lines which represented equal gradations of shade I find it more convenient and direct and I believe much more accurate I think I can thus take a copy of the nebula with as much exactness as I can see it To settle the angles of position of the triple star lines were drawn on the starchart re presenting their apparent directions as referred to other stars in the nebula The nebula as delineated by lines was compared by Mr Smith and verified some slight alterations were suggested by himself nearly all of which a reexamination confirmed and some others added which are better expressed in the drawing than by descriptionWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 177 18 Nebula h 2008 1839 dug 1Observed nebula M 17 Nearly all the parts figured by Herschel in the Phil Trans are distinctly and beautifully seen The night has evidently improved The two knots which Herschel describes in the appendix to his paper are well seen tbut the upper one not resolvable the lower one is seen by Mr Smith and myself oval and ex tending downwards I think there is a small branch at the angle of the nebula in a down ward direction towards a coarse collection of large stars just below A careful diagram made of this and other particulars dug 3The curved part of this nebula is certainly smaller in proportion to the bright following branch than is represented in Herschels figure The extremely faint preceding branch neither of us are able to see although guided by Herschels figure dug 7There is a coarse collection of stars below this nebula in which I have once or twice suspected faint nebulosity The branch before spoken of as extending downwards from the smaller of the two knots seems to pass to the right hand part of this cluster and perhaps running through it to rise again returning to the bright arm of the nebula near the star 29 This is but a bare suspicion for an assemblage of stars often gives a deceptive ap pearance of nebulosity among them  There is I think a faint ray from the internal angle of the nebula towards the upper star of Herschels figure 25 of Plate VIS This observation of Mr Smiths it was too late for me to verify dug 10MIessier 17 Figured the stars in this nebula amountinig to upwards of thirty also the principal features of the nebula The bright following branch is remarkably devoid of large stars it is however thick set with extremely small stars just beyond the limits of distinct visibility the places of three of these after long attention I have succeeded in fixing and with time and patience could obtain more but have little of either to spare the fatigue of the eye moreover is extreme The observation made by Mr Smith on the 7th of a faint ray towards the star 25 is in a great measure confirmed I see certainly the upper boundary of such a ray but think it melts into or joins with the bright branch of the nebula below being like a thin veil or gauze of light drawn up from the bright nebula and stretched from the star to the internal  It is scarcely to be supposed that this very common illusion is due to the sympathy of the neighbouring party of the retina which is only adequate to account for the usual aberration or irradiation of stars If I might hazard a conjecture I should perhaps attribute it to the same optical effect by which Sir J Herschel Mem Ast Soc Vol II p 490 is inclined to explain the apparent recession of the nebula Orionis from the stars of the trapezium situate within it contrast with their strong light blotting out the nebula in their vicinity So the diffuse starlight which always redeems the sky from perfect blackness may perhaps among many large stars be faintly revealed by contrast with the portions effaced in the immediate vicinity of the stars This is at best a very doubtful explanation and principally thrown out for the purpose of calling attention to the phenomenon VII 2 U178 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULA angle where lies Herschels resolvable knot And if I mistake not all the space from this star to the vertex of the bend is filled up with extremely faint light The knot is isolated from the rest of the nebula and the vacancy in which it is situated is closed in on the right and left hand but I think not above and below or at least above The nebula at the external angle stretches much farther towards the north preceding than in Herschels figure but with a faint shade Mr Smith confirms my view of his ray d3ug 14Finished the delineation of the nebula 17 of Messier by the mode of lines The larger knot stretches faintly upwards to a second nucleus or rather star just above With close attention I am almost satisfied it is a very small star The curve of the bright following branch is much as in Herschels drawing I think the curve of the faint bend dif fers more materially aug 19Attempted some observation on Messier 17 but the moon interferes It is too late for the star seen on the 14th in Herschels knot to be verified by Mr Smith Farther reexamination was desirable upon this nebula and the places of the stars it contained but such is now impracticable 19 Nebula h 2092 and 2093 1839 JulyThere were several observations of little importance during the month of Jfuly in which these two nebule were noted as separate and the peculiarities of Herschels description recorded as being 4 well seen dug 1The faint band suspected between V 14 and 2093 of Herschels catalogue is fully confirmed by this evenings observation Mr Smith and myself were both able to trace the nebula continuously from one to the other and the reverse so that these are now satisfactorily ascertained to constitute one immense nebula stretching through several fields of 30 diameter From the right ascensions and declinations of these two nebuhe as given by Herschel the whole cannot well be less than 20 or 30 long The double star mentioned by Herschel is seen as also the trapezium near the bifurcation but the latter is evidently somiiewhat distorted in his figure The peculiar characteristic of the upper portion of the nebula cannot be mistaken I can think of no comparison as good as that which Herschel gives it that of a network or interlacing of nebula The stars follow the disposition of this network very perfectly and their real connexion with the nebula is as obvious as the testi noiiy of the eye and of common sense can make it It is almost impossible that the pheno menon can result from a mere superposition of stars indeed the chances against the suppo sition of their independence of each other must be very nearly infinite d2ug 3Attempted a triangulation among the principal stars in the great Nebula Cygni so assist in exactly copying the nebula Thirteen were thus taken their angles of position with each other and comparative distances carefully estimated and called out by one of us while the other recorded The power used was the ordinary observing powei of 80WITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 179 dug 7Nebula Cygni The method of fixing the places of the stars adopted on the 3d was found much too slow and tedious I therefore fixed a lamp just beneath my feet on the ladder of steps and found I could by this means easily copy the stars from the field on a sheet of paper I think this method is as exact as that of the 3d I can thus correct and re correct as long as my eye perceives any difference between the original and the copy It is moreover much more rapid I have recorded and corrected fiftyeight stars in the course of three or four hours and affixed their magnitudes with equal care The nebula is at the trapezium of stars divided as in Herschels figure but just below this the larger branch forks again or at least is fainter along the middle than at the edges Mr Smith and myself noticed this independently of each other and without previous notice of each others views The brightest part of the nebula is at the bifurcation near the trapezium the next brightest though considerably fainter is situated in the interlaced portion and lies along the two stars 133 and 162 Jug 9Figured one hundred and thirtyfour stars in the same way as on August 7th about ninety of these are new The time occupied was about six hours These complete all within the network portion of the nebula All the stars down to the minimum visibile are put down which are near the brighter portions of the nebula in some excessively faint branches and convolutions winding away to a greater distance only those more easily seern are recorded The scale of magnitudes is an artificial one from 1 to 12 the star 187 being of magnitude 1 and the  minima visibilia 149 and 156 being of the 12th Care has been taken to set down every star in the dark hollows left by the interwoven nebula and the  wonderful phenomenon described by Herschel becomes in this way very apparent for a tolerably correct represerntation of many of the windings of the nebula in the heavens may be obtained by simply following on the starchart the courses marked out by the stars themselves On the complete map of the stars the future nebula already strikes the eye In the lower part of the nebula for convenience sake termed  the bifurcate while the upper may be called the network portion the same faint division was seen as last night With 220 faint stars were seen in each division of the great branch Mr Smith suspected another branch turning off to the right hand towards the bright star 8 I am of the same opinion There is a chain of stars consisting of three loops or more which hang festoon like from the preceding side of the nebula and which seem to be mixed with nebulosity in the same way as in the network portion If this is so the branch noticed by Mr Smith forms the beginning of one of those loops But there is great liability to error where nebu losity is suspected among a congeries or chain of stars and especially is this the case in the present nebula on account of the wonderful peculiarity already mentioned Jug 10The stars along the bifurcate portion of the nebula were recorded this evening twentyfive of which out of between fifty and sixty were new On this evening and on former evenings the lowest power of about 80 was employed in taking all the stars down to the ninth or tenth magnitude of my scale and a higher power of 220 was employed to ob180 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE tain the fainter stars of the eleventh and twelfth magnitudes where such were deemed de sirable The nebula itself was decidedly fainter with 220 than with 80 and on this account as well as from its great extent the nebula was examined and figured principally with the lowest power These remarks apply also to the powers commonly used on the other nebulae I think the nebula terminates near a pretty bright star 1 I cannot certainly trace it far ther Two bright stars of my first magnitude or rather higher than any magnitude of my scale lie a little to the left hand of this extremity Much of the nebula was roughly figured last night the figuring tonight completed in the network portionalso in the faint band down to the bifurcation The character of this band seems to change as it approaches the network beginning to break up into windings and hollows as if it partially partook of the strange peculiarity of that portion in its approach thereto The other end of the nebula seems disposed if I may so speak to break up into rifts and branches nearly parallel and is certainly very different in its characteristics from the upper portion adug 19Nebula Cygni Thirty or forty stars were added to the extreme lower por tion of which not onehalf are new The description of the nebula by lines begun I am still uncertain about the three loops mentioned on the 9th If they are as suspected there is reason to believe the same in many places all around Indeed the whole background of the heavens around the network and in some places below seems intersected with loops of suspected nebulosity it is certainly different in appearance from other portions of the hea vens The loops and lacework which are certainly visible probably fade off into such as we cannot see or at least can but suspect I am not entirelycertain of the subdivision into two of the larger bifurcate branch first inoticed August 7th With 220 two or three minute stars are set down in each of the sup posed branches which certainly add to the effect if they do not produce it But with con siderable attention the division seems to exist above and below the place where these minute stars are the nebula between the two minor branches being not much inferior to either of them in brightness The other division that of Herschel is tolerably black and very dis tinct On the whole I tlhink the existence of a second division is coinfirmed dug 20The description of the Nebula Cygni by lines completed The stars in the extreme lower part of this nebula are not so accurately placed as at the bifurcation and in the network nor do they descend to as definite and equal a limit in the scale of magnitudes But such care is obviously of less use in this lower diffuse part The star 83 at the bifurcation was suspected to be a nucleus With 220 it appears somewhat blotty and different from other equal stars in the vicinity It is in the very brightest portion of the nebula at the principal bifurcation With long attention I am still uncertain whether this be a nucleus or a kind of nebulous star To determine this point must require a telescope of greater light or at least a better eye Mr Smith had no oppor tunity of examining this pointWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 181 The various particulars in the figured nebule were confirmed by Mr Smith on different evenings and such points as he did not confirm are considered as uncertain MICROMETRICAL MEASURES OF THE STARS IN THE NEBULE 20 The instrument with which these were taken was the ten feet telescope of G Dollond belonging to the philosophical department of Yale College The aperture of this telescope is five inches and its defining power is such as to resolve E Librwe a Coronw Borealis and other double stars of between 1 and 2 distance and to exhibit the division in the ring of Saturn with ease The micrometer is also of Dollonds most recent construction a parallel wire mi crorneter with screws of about one hundred threads to the inch each revolu tion of the screw being subdivided into lOOths upon graduated heads Farther subdivision when desirable is easily made by estimation The wires are I  The fourteen feet telescope used in these observations was taken down in the latter part of August On the graduation of the class in Yale College to which Mr Smith and myself had belonged the reflector became wholly the property of Mr Smith and was removed to Ohio City Ohio It has already been remounted there and in a better frame and with mnore perfect adjustments than before as an extract from a recent letter of his will show The stand he writes  is precisely similar to the engraving in the Philosophical Transactions of the one erected by Ramage at the Royal Observatory Greenwich It is full twenty feet high and has a sliding gallery that will hold with convenience four persons The telescope swings between two parallel beams about six feet apart up and dowln these the gallery can be raised or depressed by one person easily The telescope is con structed to roll forward so that the mouth may be at a convenient distance from the gallery After observing the tube can be let down into a tight box and locked up the whole is supported by four iron rollers and can be turned by one person in any direction The apparatus for slow motion in altitude is the same as in New Haven I have been making some arrangements for a slow motion in azimuth Mr Smith farther writes that he has been prevented fromn mnaking any observations of importance by the continuance of unfavourable weather He has however lately fitted an excellent micrometer to his telescope the work of an American artist and will soon be prepared for fresh labours From his zeal and activity with so valuable an instrument we cannot but expect the most interesting results By the same letter I am furnished with a note of his observations on the 16th of July 1839 which I insert as favourably exhibiting the power and capability of the telescope about the time it was employed on the foregoing nebule     July 19 8 P M Saw k Virginis with 400 and 700 the latter a single lens very beautifully the same evening 10 P M saw A Ophinchi distinctly separated and at II P M  Bootis

the defining power of the instrument But few of the common tests of light have been observed Favourable specimens of its  minimum visibile are however 149 and 156 of the large Nebula Cygni already instanced besides two or three of the smallest stars in each of the other nebuln By an entry in the rough journal of observations it appears that A 250 or the  Polarissima  of Herschel a nebula almost exactly at the pole was if certainly seen a fair example of its limit of visual power VIT2 v182 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE believe of platina with the present telescope they are each 228 in thickness their number and arrangement as also the construction of other parts of the micrometer is very similar to that of Troughtons spiderline micrometer as described in Pearsons Practical Astronomy 21 The illumination however is different and resembles that employed by Frauenhofer to render visible his lines on glass The light falls on the wires at right angles to the optical axis of the telescope thus illuminating them upon one side while the rest of the field is dark This arrangement possesses con siderable advantages in rendering visible small stars which it would be other wise extremely difficult to measure if indeed they could be seen at all in an illuminated field I found this property of great use since nearly all the stars I wished to measure were below the tenth or eleventh magnitude The chief faults of the present construction were two The scale of teeth in the field of view which marks the number of whole revolutions is illuminated only edge wise by the light it was in all positions difficult and in many impossible to be read off Great loss of time and sometimes impaired accuracy was the necessary consequence The other defect was in the size of the wires this made the line of illumination needlessly broad and prevented small stars from being seen near or on it unless too faintly lighted for accuracy Neither of these faults are necessary to this construction and both might be remedied without difficulty 22 The telescope being mounted with an altitude and azimuth motion which moreover was quite unsteady and liable to tremors was illadapted to micrometrical observation The mode of managing the micrometer was ne cessarily peculiar and its essential differences from the common and more regular employment of the instrumnent I shall briefly describe The circle of the micrometer was turned until the stars in the field ran parallel to the two moveable wires Their transits across the fixed wire which then represented an hour circle at that point of the heavens were noted blindly in a book at hand no other way being practicable with a succession of stars at intervals of a few seconds each or occasionally of less than a second These furnished differences of right ascension Those of declination were obtained by bringing the moveable wires over the two stars whose difference was required No measure was considered good in which some star brought on one of the wires for that purpose was not completely bisected during the whole run across theWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 183 field and at each new bearing of the telescope preparatory to a fresh run the circle of position was altered accordingly But in this way many measures were necessarily rejected The farther end of the telescope was steadied by contact with a double opening windowshutter which gradually yielded to the azimuthal motion yet with sufficient resistance to maintain the stars in the field at perfect rest In declination on account of the defects before mentioned and others of minor importance more than one measure could seldom be obtained during a single run across the field and that not cotemporaneously with the transits In addition to this the frequent necessity of entire disadjustment of the micro mneter in order to read off the scale within the field caused a great waste of time so that the measurement of the stars in the nebule though of less im portance than the observations with the reflector occupied very much more time and labour And it will not be surprising after this very incomplete statement of the difficulties which it was necessary to encounter and of the numerous sources of error thence arising if the following measures should in a few cases offer somewhat greater discordances than those which occur in observations with a steady instrument moving in the parallel of the star and employed in measuring objects that can bear direct vision and full illumi nation 23 Reduction of the Mleasures The value of the screw since the field would scarce include the suns diameter was determined entirely by passages of known stars over a given interval a number of which were observed nearly every evening on which any measures were taken It was subject to a very slight fluctuation depending on changes of temperature and minute differences of focal adjustment and hence it was checked by a comparison of the measures of the largest differences of declination on different evenings One revolution of the screw at its mean state was equal to 171640 The zero error was always measured by daylight and was applied as a cor rection to the intervals of passage on all stars which were taken to determine the value of the scale and to all measures in declination During the fall months it increased gradually and uniformly from  157 to  383 There is evidently no allowance necessary for the thickness of the wires on account of their partial illumination in any of the different uses to which the micrometer was applied in the presenit instance184 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE 24 A correction remains to be noticed which is due to difference of refrac tion in any two stars whose apparent differences of R A and Decl have been measured This becomes of considerable importance from the construction of the observatory which was such as to limit the range of the telescope to com paratively low altitudes for the stars of the nebule were observable only during the last two or three hours of their diurnal circles The altitude of the object at the time of observation was therefore noted at first roughly by means of a rude quadrant or by estimation from the bearing of the telescope afterwards when the importance of this correction was fully known and especially in the Nebula Cygni where the distances measured were considerable by recording the sidereal time of observation from which the hour angle anid thence the altitude of the object is easily deduced The altitude being known the ob served measures were corrected for refraction by the following equations If A and D  the observed differences of R A and Decl between any two stars in the field reckoned with their usual signs and in minutes of space and A and D  the true differences      CC r  difference of refraction for 1 at the known altitude always positive v  the angle of variation of the hour circle in the field of view reckoned from the

observed differences of Decl and R A be tween two stars in the field of view the last to observed passages of a single star between two wires in determining the value of the scale These equa tions are not such as they would be for an instrument mounted equatorially they express the condition that the stars in the field shall at all altitudes run on a parallel to one of the wires which was in the present instance the only practicable mode of conducting observation For the three nebule observed the values of r cos2 v eq 1 and 2 r sin V cos v sec S eq 2 were calculated for every observable degree of altitude andWITH A FOURTEEN PEET RE3FLECTOR 185 their logarithms to two places tabulated Its application to each individual measure thus becomes very easy 25 The first column of the following series of measures contains the date of observation In the second are the numbers of the measured stars as referred to the catalogue The sign  between them indicates diferences of right as cension or declination thus in Art 26 1 9 stands for Decl of star 1 Decl of star 9 The third column contains the observed difference of right ascension A or of declination of D The fourth shows the altitude or sidereal time of ob servation In the fifth is the correction for refraction due to such altitude for declination r D cos2 v and for right ascension 2 r D sin v cos v sec S ac cording to

several sets of measures have been obtained between the same two stars they have been combined by assigning to eaclh a weight proportioned to the value of 2 with some restrictions where either n or e are so small as to render the weight very minute on the one hand or immensely large on the other And wherever as is frequently the case measures have been taken through a series of stars by different steps and intervals of progress so as mutually to check each other the most probable results have been deduced from their combination by the method of minimum squares and are given below The first

Cygni that incidentally given by Sir J Herschel in his description of nebula h 2088 Phil Trans 1833 No 1 of192 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE h 1991 in my catalogue corresponds to A S C 2063 and is in the same field with the nebula The places of the stars of h 1991 may therefore be regarded as tolerably accurate The intervals between the other two nebule and the respective stars to which they were referred were much larger the one occu pying 1 the other 12m of sidereal time and of course as great exactness was not attainable by the means employed The necessity of selecting a calm evening and of maintaining perfect stillness in the observatory during these long intervals on account of its height and the unsteadiness of the telescope yet at the same time of correcting the uncompensated clock which was em ployed by coincident observations with the transit instrument rendered these comparisons less frequent than they otherwise would have been The small uncertainty which this circumstance introduces into the absolute right ascen sions of the stars is a constant error and is of slight importance since the places of the standard stars as assumed above would alone give rise to uncer tainty of the same nature The reduced differences in Article 32 were made such as they would have been at the epoch 18300 The measured stars previouisly arranged in the form of a catalogue by means of the three already mentioned were projected on paper and compared with the original charts described in Article 7 by pricking the stars through from one upon the other 34 To form some idea of the amount of necessary error involved in the pro cess of estimation described in Article 7 the differences of R A and Decl be tween the measured and estimated places in h 1991 were carefully measured by a scale and vernier They are as follows Error ir Star R A Decl 1 1s7 22117 2 0 4 14 5 8 0 10 09 9 000 00 18 0 26 00 21 0 17 14 22 0 68 38 24 042 19 5 25 0 23 00 28 0 03 0 9 It is to be noticed that star 24 was excessively difficult of measure ment not being seen on or very near the wire The large errors apparentlyWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 193 belonging to it are probably not those of estimation but of rough and difficult measurement The errors of star 1 are on account of its distance from the nebula without any intermediate stars recorded and the remainder except 2 are all within very close limits It may be farther remarked that the errors in h 2008 were generally about foujr times as large as in h 1991 also in h 20923 they were three or four times as large at similar distances and in some instances on the remote con fines much larger More time and pains were spent on the first of the three partly in order to ascertain how much error was necessarily included in the method of estimation 35 The places of the following stars Ii 1991 24 h 2008 6 9 23 25 Ii 20923 129 144 differ in a slight degree in the catalogues from the resuilts of measurement These are cases in which the measures are rendered some what uncertain on account of extreme faintness and are afterwards found to disagree with the original chart The general closeness with which the esti mations coincide with good measures authorize in these few instances an equal or greater confidence in the former 36 The artificial scale of magnitudes mentioned in the observation of Aug 9th Article 19 was converted into the common nomenclature by comparison with various stars incidentally noticed by Sir J Herschel in this respect The magnitudes assigned in his several catalogues of double stars to the three in dividuals of the triple star in h 1991 and those of six stars described by himr as forming a trapezium or oval at the bifurcation of the Nebula Cygni see Article 59 are principally relied on The first column in the following catalogues contains the number of the star in order of right ascension the second its magnitude the third its mean right ascension and the fourth its mean declination at the epoch A D 18300 The right ascension is given to the nearest tenth of a second of time except that of the stars measured by the micrometer which are distinguished from the rest by the addition of a second decimal So the declination is in even seconds for the estimated and descends to teinths for the measured places NOTEIt appears to the committee that the coefficient 2 in Mr Masons formula for correctingfI the observed differenice of riglht ascension should be omitted and this correction be made only half as great as Mr Masons The error from this source does not on the average amount to more than Os1 in time in the following catalogue vii2 Y194 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE 37 Catalogue of the Stars in the Nebula h 1991 No Mag R A 18300 Decl 18300 1 67 17 51m 36s51 220 45 58115 2 1112  5783

due to the some what hurried completion of the map of that nebula in the month of August the mooni becoming troublesome sooner thani was altogether convenient And for the purposes of correction only two or three stars exist in or very near this nebula of a magnitude as great as the eleventh so that it was necessary to place reliance on the extremely difficult measures of the twelfth and thirteenth magnitudes But one set of measures in Decl were taken of star 193 in the large nebulaWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 197 and this was found to differ considerably from the original map The number of even revolutions of the micrometer screw may possibly have been read off wrong and if this is the case some eight or ten stars in its neighbourhood will be affected by its error But these are out of the direct course of the nebula In general the relative places are well determined by these right as censions and declinations DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES 41 By far the greatest obstacles to the successful comparison of modern ob servations on nebule with those which own at least a brief antiquity exist in the want of precision with which the labours of former observers have been conducted and hence all attempts to trace the slow progress of their changes end in uncertain conjectures and conflicting probabilities I shall not there fore incur the charge of unnecessary minuteness in endeavouring to render by every means our knowledge of the present form and state of at least these few nebulae as far as possible standard and although laden with the neces sary imperfections of original observations yet free from adventitious and un necessary vagueness in the communication of them In order to supply to any future observer those slight particulars which a chart cannot easily urge upon the notice of any but the original compiler and farther to indicate the degree of certainty with which different features of the nebule were recognised it is thought proper to bring under this head the enumeration of various facts not expressed in the journal of observations These are divided into  things certain nearly certain strongly suspected and  slightly suspected 42 The plates are such as to distort as little as possible the relative posi tion of the stars since the development of the spherical surface is by projection on a plane tangent to the centre of each nebula The nebulae are in the position in which they appear in a Herschellian re flector when on the meridian south being uppermost in the present cases and the preceding the right hand portions The letters s p n f on the plates serve as ready references where these terms are used in description In plate V where one of the nebule is represented by lines of equal bright ness Article 12 the half lines serve to indicate suspected gradations of shade while the even numbers mark those that are more certain Thus the lines 1 VIT2 z198 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE are the utmost limits of nebulous light perfectly and certainly visible while the line I is about as far as it is suspected to extend The line 1 also encloses a space suspected to be a little brighter than the surrounding parts Nebula h 1991 43 Things certain1 A large nebula surrounding the star 22 not hitherto noticed See Art 17 Aug 7 and 10 2 A slight diminution of its light within the pentagon formed by the stars 15 20 27 26 and 22 Art 17 Aug 10 3 It is more extensive on the northern than southern side but its gradation or concentration is evidently from all directions toward the bright star 22 4 In the trifid nebula The particulars concerning the attachment of the triple star to the skirts of the part A and of its eccentricity in other respects as mentioned in Art 17 Aug 1 and 9 5 The rift a suddenly shelves outwards and to the north forming a tole rably definite boundary as is indicated by the comparative closeness with which the lines succeed each other See Art 17 Aug 10 6 This boundary is convex inwards or towards the stars 3 and 5 7 The gradation from light to darkness on the inner boundary of the portion A is somewhat more sudden than on that of the other two 8 And in all three it is more sudden on the inner than on the outer boun daries 44 NVearly certain1 The portion B extends down to the stars 2 and 21 2 It also runs up a little into the cleft 3 fading off very imperceptibly Art 17 Aug 9 3 The boundary of A running down from the triple star turns faintly off at an obtuse angle at the star 19 while a portion of somewhat less intensity encompasses the star 25 This fact is expressed in Plate V by the bending of lines 2 and 3 at that point and their proximity the line 1 diverging from them to the star 25 4 The upper extremity of A between the stars 12 and 28 runs up to a pretty sharp angle 5 In the northern nebula A slight increase of intensity on the right hand of the vacancy it is enclosed by the line 4 Art 17 Aug 10WITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 199 45 Strongly suspectedI A slight brightening up of the nebula where enclosed by the line 11 as if beginning to break up into a still farther subdi vision This if real subdivides the dark branch a into two in its outward course Art 17 Aug 10 2 The filling up of the clefts with faint nebulosity 3 The same between the northern and southern nebula faintly uniting the two 46 Slightly suspected1 The angular irregularity on the south and fainter side of the part C renderinig it not unlike a shell with a subangular margin Nebula h 2008 47 Things certain1 The resolvable knot mentioned by Herschel Art 58 Phil Trans 1833 near the star 18 is isolated or nearly so from the rest of the nebula Not seeni resolvable by us See Art 18 Aug 10 2 The smaller knot is apparently not affected with this peculiarity 3 Of the faint bend or loop at the right hand the following half is brighter than the preceding 4 The bright branch fades gradually away to the left terminating near the star 36 it is convex upwards 5 The external angle of the nebula stretches down from the star 17 towards the north preceding much farther tharl in Herschels drawing Art 18 Aug 10 6 The bend in the drawing of Sir J Herschlel is too large especially in a vertical direction when compared with the bright following branch Art 18 Aug 3 and 14 48 Nearly certain1 The bright branch is more definitely bounded on its upper or southern side than upon the lower 2 From the larger knot at the internal angle of the nebula a faint ray proceeds as far as star 25 Art 18 Aug 7 and 10 3 The upper margin of this ray is tolerably definite and thence it spreads downwards till it iningles with the brightness below Art 18 Aug 10 4 The resolvable knot of Herschel has either a second nucleus or in volves a faint star 18 in its upper margin Art 18 Aug 14 5 The partially vacant space in which it is situated is closed in by the ne200 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE bula on the right and left and perhaps beneath but is more open upward Art 18 Aug 10 6 The star 11 is too far down the preceding limb of the bend in Sir J Herschels figure it should be nearer the vertex 7 A slight protrusion from the upper curve of the bend involves the star 9 49 Strongly suspected1 Very faint nebulosity stretching across from star 25 to star 9 filling all the internal angle of the nebula Art 18 Aug 10 2 Faint nebulosity extending from the stars 6 and 4 to or beyond star 2 3 A considerable but faint diffusion of the nebula at the external angle towards the north preceding 4 The fainter knot stretches still more faintly a little way downward Art 18 Aug 1 5 Just above star 16 is a portion a little brigrhter than the rest of the bend 50 Slightly suspected1 An extension of the appearance mentioned in No 4 of Art 49 downwards past stars 19 and 20 Art 18 Aug 1 and 7 2 A bare suspicion of nebulosity among a coarse cluster of stars between llm and 1rn 30 and in about16 8 or 10 Decl Art 18 Aug 7 Nebula h 2092 and 2093 51 Things certain 1 The brightest accumulation of nebulous matter is within the triangle formed by stars 69 83 and 93 2 Not much inferior to this in intensity is the portioln included between the bright stars 133 and 162 Art 19 Aug 7 3 The brightest loop of the network portion is a figure not altogether unlike a Greek v turned thus t and containing No 2 just described The first or upper bend of this figure contains two curious triplets of stars very similar in position and magnitude the south following angle has in it a quintuple or sextuple star of which two individuals 149 and 156 are about the minima visibilia of the 14 feet reflector Art 19 Aug 9 4 These two No 1 and 3 are the two great nuclea of the nebula 5 From the north following angle of the v at the star 162 a branch pro ceeds southward of brightness little inferior to that of the v for the sake of shortness I call this A though possessing no resemblance to that letter 6 All the other loops and branches in this region except the v and A are extreinely faintWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 201 7 The obtuse angled parallelogrram preceding the v certainly exists 8 All or nearly all the visible stars in its neighbourhood are as certainly arranged along its course in apparent intimate connexion with it Art 19 Aug 9 9 It is without doubt connected to the v in the way represented in the figure 10 The loop which parts from the v at the quintuple star and passing out wards by the stars 157 and 142 rejoins it near the double triplet of stars 11 That this loop sends out a very faint branch towards stars 171 and 174 is more than nearly certain though not absolutely so 12 The same may be said of a slight nebulosity in the region of the stars 183 and 184 13 That the stars in this neighbourhood are to a certain extent disposed in the same order as the nebulous matter forming rude chains or loops coincident with those of the nebula is certain This feature is most strongly developed in the v and in the parallelogram No 7 of Art 51 and though less striking is certainly recognisable in the circuits Nos 3 8 9 and 10 of Art 52 and in the branch No 1 of Art 53 Art 19 Aug 1 and 9 14 Proceeding downwards now towards the triangle of bright stars on the parallel of 300 40 the faint band connecting h 2092 and h 2093 branches from the 4 near the star 166 and taking the conspicuous stars 176 121 129 and 103 in its course brightens at last into the very considerable intensity mentioned in No 1 This connexion undoubtedly exists Art 19 Aug 1 15 The faint branch starting from this band near its connexion with the 4 towards stars 177 and 180 is about as certain as that of No 11 16 The faint branich in the opposite direction starting fronm the A at stars 166 and 168 towards star 119is certain 17 In the bifurcate portion Of the two main branches into which it forks the upper or s p is far the widest and most conspicuous They are much too nearly equal in the drawing of Sir J Herschel 18 The n f branch extends but little beyond the double star 56 57 19 The s p branch reaches much farther fading away in diffused nebu losity nearly or quite as far down as star 1 Art 19 Aug 10 52 Nearly certain1 The lonig faint trace of light No 13 of Art 51 ap pears at first sight a band of nearly uniform breadth and light and tolerably VII3 A202 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE straight But with long attention the irregularities represented in the figure are pretty certainly made out The narrow winding part differs in intensity from the rest of the band too minutely to be at all represented in an engraving unless much exaggerated as in Plate VI The chief irregularities are at tended with little doubt and are as follow 2 Beginning at the upper end it bends outward so as to involve the the bright star 176 fading off very diffusely in the concavity on the opposite side 3 It forms an illdefined and scarcely complete loop around the stars 163 165 161 159 143 128 it being faintest and most imperfect on its p or n p side It is at this point that in tracing the nebula from north to south it first begins to assume the remarkable peculiarity of interweaving with stars in loops or network Art 19 Aug 10 4 Turning from the bright stars 121 and 129 it bends perhaps more than in the drawing towards the stars 146 and 160 on the following side involving the former and the pretty bright star 144 in its course 5 Bending back to the preceding side it very nearly reaches and per haps involves the bright star 103 6 On the opposite side it faintly diffuses itself to a considerable distance fading away nearly or quite as far as the stars 138 and 139 the space be tween these and 155 134 being however quite vacant 7 After crossing the parallel of 300 o it soon grows brighter and passes into the bifurcate portion 8 In the network portion A very faint loop whose extremities are the branches Nos 11 and 15 of Art 51 and which takes in its course No 12 of the same is either  nearly certain  or strongly suspected Its course be ginning from the south is along the stars 174 183 184 188 189 194 191 192 180 and 177 9 The extension of branch No 16 of Art 51 as far as star 119 10 This branch also sends off a subdivision towards or along stars 145 135 132 and 127 11 The part of the v about the double triple star brightens up a little making a kind of feeble third nucleus with Nos I and 2 of Art 51 12 In the bifurcate portion The broad s p division forks again into two one branch of which passes as niear as can be judged over star 32 the other beWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 203 tween stars 32 and 24 The space between them is very little less nebulous than the branches rendering their separate courses indefinite and somewhat uncertain The stars of the 15th and 16th magnitudes namely 51 52 43 and 34 are in the lower and 33 41 are in or just beneath the upper of these two subdivisions These stars prevent this fromr being classed in Art 51 See Art 19 Aug 7 9 10 19 13 A diffuse and faint nebulosity fills up all the space in the principal rift 14 The n p division pretty certainly involves the double star 56 57 in its northern margin not as Hershel describes and figures it passing clear of it to the south 15 At the point of bifurcation the nebula runs up to a dense nucleus of somewhat definite outline the figure of 74 which as referred to the stars in that quarter is by a careful 66 comparison of the drawings of two evenings as in the margin The fork originates very near or at the star 78 9 53 Strongly suspectedl The faint branch of nebula starting from the upper end of the v along the bright stars 98 84 and 66 and spreading through the cluster 97 92 75 71 70 63 60 59 55 53 It is very faintly described in the engraving Stars clustering thickly are so apt to deceivle in this respect that what would otherwise be considered as certain is in this in stance only  strong suspicion 2 From the south preceding angle of the parallelogram No 7 of Art 51 a faint branch is believed to extend to star 14 or beyond It is very slightly marked in the engraving 3 The branch No 9 of Art 52 probably completes the loop by joining the v at the two bright stars 104 and 110 4 The branch No 10 of Art 52 also probably extends to the v It is pretty definitely bounded on its preceding but fades diffusely on the following side filling nearly all the vacancy between it and the 4b with vacrue nebulosity 5 The A seems to be barely disjoined from the v at and near the star 162 as if it were in the act of breaking away by the force of contrary attractions This may very possibly be owing to the effect of the bright star 162 in appa rently effacing the nebula in its immediate vicinity 6 From the northern extremity of the parallelogram No 7 of Art 51 near stars 54 and 47 the loop faintly marked in the engraving probably curves round and joins the loop No 3 of Art 53 near the stars 106 119204 OBSERVATIONS ON NEBULE 7 The loop No 10 of Art 51 is very indefinite on its inner margin and perhaps very

Observations of these Nebulae 55 All the light which we can obtain on the past history of these niebule becomes of great moment in the inquiry Whether their present form and character are now sufficiently well determined to be a standard for the future I have therefore collected into one group in order of time such scattered notices of each as I have been able to find the collection of which as independent observations differing greatly in point of time is of considerable interest in detecting some important errors and in ascertaining the probable stability of the nebule And furthermore the distinguishing characteristics of that mode of observing and describing the nebulk which it is a chief object of this paper to explain will be more distinctly illustrated by a comparison of former with the present observations 56 At the time of pursuing these inquiries with the 14 feet Reflector the great catalogue of Sir J Herschel Phil Trans 1833 was the only one with

regard to stars Of these the most singular are IV 41 fig 80 and that of fig 82 The lat ter however is very imperfectly expressed in the drawing Indeed it would be excessively difficult to execute a drawing of such an object with any pretensions to correctness In this general resemblance and character only has been aimed at enough to express the peculiar feature of the object which is a net work or tracery of nebule following the lines of a similar network of stars It is an extremely faint and difficult object and only once observed but I do not thinik it possible I could have been deceived as to the reality of the phenomenonz especially since the brighter parts of the nebula are stated in the observation to have been distinctly seen 60 A number of interesting results are deducible from the comparison of these observations with each other and with those embodied in this paper some few of which I shall point out 61 The large nebula surrounding star 22 of h 1991 appears to have escaped the eyes of both the elder and younger Herschels Unless we construe the remarks of Sir Wm Herschel in his paper of 1811 that  more faint nebu losities are following as a notice of this nebula But had Sir Wm Herschel actually seen the nebulous companion which surrounding a bright star at so short a distance from the principal triple nebula at once renders the whole system one of the most wonderful and instructive in the heavens it is in the highest degree improbable that he would have passed over withi so light a comment a fact more highly illustrative of his peculiar views than any of the instances he has so laboriously collected His remark which seems otherwise inapplicable as a description of this object more probably refers to some smaller and very faint nebulosities at several fields distance one or two such were marked by us as Nove having no synonyms in the younger Herschels catalogue but for want of proper instrumental means their places could not be settled 62 Measures

be confirmed 63 The nebula IV 41 and V 10 11 and 12 of Sir Win Herschels cata logues are identical Sir J Herschel seems to have recognised only the former And it appears that Sir Wm Herschel supposed them different nebulke from his assigning to them two different places in his catalogues 64 Tlle observations on h 2092 and 2093 by former observers are in great confusioln inter se Of the two  compound systems or milky ways in Sir Wm Herschels first quoted paper the  second  answers to the bifurcate and tlhe  third to the network portion of this nebula If the descriptions there given did not show conclusively that this was the case the places assigned would remove all doubt Again in his first catalogue of 1000 he repeats the description of the third milky way under the title of V 14 which must there fore correspond to the network and the place he assigns when reduced be comes R A 20 501 0 Decl  300 50 which exactly coincides with the brightest point of this portion Sir J Herschel seems to have overlooked or mistaken some of these observations by applying the synonym V 14 to the bi furcate portion and calling the network  Nova whereas both these suppo sitions the above comparison shows to be unwarrantable There is also some reason to believe from the description in his paper of 1811 Art 59 that the elder Herschel saw the faint band which I have shown connects these two portions or in other words traced out the whole nebula the figure 1 however to which he refers so immediately exhibits no trace of resemnblance to the object as seen by us nor is the difference such as coulld be caused by any difference in telescopes Nor is it at all in favour of this beliefWITH A FOURTEEN FEET REFLECTOR 213 that he quotes from his catalogue under the title of V 14 which I have shown corresponds to the network onlyand assigns as in that catalogue an extent of 52 in a meridional direction a quantity entirely too small to include the whole nebula especially when we consider that in other particulars of dimension he has rather over than under estimated I am therefore unable to decide this point At the time of our own observations and until quite recently I did not know that there was any ground for attributing to the elder Herschel a full view of the whole nebula and the remarks of the younger Herschel show conclusively that he was not aware of their being united nor so understood his fathers observations 65 It will be seen by reference to the figured nebulh of Sir J Herschel that his figure 34 represents that portion of our largest nebula included be tween the parallels 30 55 and 31 20 in Plate VII Figure 82 represents the general character of the portion between 30 10 and 30 40 66 The N P D of 1i 2093 as given by Herschel is 600 26 6 or in decli nation  290 34 A reference to the map or catalogue will show the brightest portion to be about  300 28 40 The place assigned by Sir J Herschel is therefore nearly a degree in error I was led on this account in early obser vations to attribute to the nebula a greater extent than actually belongs to it It does not much exceed a degree in declination and it is between 3m and 4111 broad in right ascension It would be very absurd to account for the error in Herschels place by supposing that not this but some nebula about a degree farther south and unseen in our observations is the one recorded by him I think it probable that the confusion I have above alluded to in the synonyms of different portions of the whole nebula is chiefly owing to this mistake inP D vII3 D

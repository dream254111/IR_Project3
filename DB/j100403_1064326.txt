injury takes place There is more difficulty in determining whether the injury arises out of the em ployment that is in establishing the causal connection between the em ployment and the injury Mueller Construction Co v Industrial Board of Illinois 283 Ill 148 118 N E 1028 An injury arises out of an employment when it occurs in the course of the employment and is a natural and necessary incident or conse quence of it though not foreseen or expected Larke v John Hancock Mut Life Ins Co 90 Conn 303 97 Atl 320 L R A 1916E 584 Only those accidents are embraced which happen to a servant while he is en gaged in the discharge of some function or duty which he is authorized to undertake and which is calculated to further directly or indirectly the masters business The injury must be reasonably incident to the employment Fitzgerald v Clarke 1908 2 K B 796 1 B W C C 197 If one employee assaults another employee solely to gratify his feel ing of anger or hatred the injury results from the voluntary act of the assailant and cannot be said to arise either directly out of the em ployment or as an incident of it Jacquemin v Turner etc Co 92 Conn 382 103 Atl 115 L R A 1918E 496 In the present case not only was the injury caused by the voluntary attack of the assailant but also the plaintiff instigated the altercation The resulting assault then pro ceeded from a risk not originated by or arising out of the employ ment Morever in provoking the assault the plaintiff performed no duty for his master but on the contrary deserted that duty for personal ends and thereby stepped out of his employment Griffin v Roberson 162 N Y Supp 313 Union Sanitary Mfg Co v Davis 64 Ind App 227 115 N E 676 See L R A 1916A 40 240 for full discussion of injuries arising out of and in the course of employment See also 3 VA LAW REV 232 6 VA LAW REV 67 MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONSPOLICE POWERBUILDING LINESA State statute gave a city the power to establish building lines within its limits and did not provide for compensation to the owner of property fronting on the streets where such lines were established The defendants were interested in the development of a certain tract of land in the city and laid out plans and sold lots on newly formed streets without regard to the building lines as established by the city The city brought suit to restrain them from further opening such streets or selling lots front ing thereon The defendants claimed that the statute in question was void as providing for the taking of property without due process of law compensation not being provided for The city contended that this was a proper exercise of the police power Held that the defendants be re strained Town of Windsor v Whitney Conn 111 Atl 354 See NOTES p 649 NUISANCEINJUNCTIONCOTTON GTNPlaintiffs acquired homes in that part of a town which was known as the ginning section To the 661VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW knowledge of plaintiffs but without objection from them defendant erected a cotton gin in close proximity to plaintiffs homes equipping it with modern devices calculated to prevent vibrations and the escape of dust and lint In spite of these precautions plaintiffs suffered an noyance from the gin and brought this suit to have it enjoined as a nuisance Held the injunction is denied Oliver v Forney Cotton Oil  Ginning Co Tex Civ App 226 S W 1094 Unless a nuisance exists per se or unless the loss resulting from the nuisance is irreparable the courts will not enjoin it Goodall v Crofton 33 Ohio St 271 31 Am Rep 535 And where it appears that the injury to plaintiff is not comparable to that which defendant and the general public would suffer if the nuisance were enjoined the court will deny the injunction Galveston etc R Co v De Groff 102 Tex 433 118 S W 134 21 L R A N S 749 But though an injunction restraining the nuisance is not allowed the plaintiff still has an action for damages for the loss he has sustained Rainey v Red River etc R Co 99 Tex 276 89 S W 768 90 S W 1096 3 L R A N S 590 122 Am St Rep 622 13 Ann Cas 580 See Baltimore etc R Co v Fifth Baptist Church 108 U S 317 On principle cotton gins so far from being nuisances per se are necessary establishments in all cottonproducing communities and to secure an abatement of them plaintiff should be required to show ma terial injury to himself or his property Where he is able to show such loss as where the gin diminished the rental value of plaintiffs house on account of emission of dust and lint an injunction is granted Faulkenbury v Wells 28 Tex Civ App 621 68 S W 327 But where he can show annoyance only the injunction will be denied Hamm v Gunn 51 Tex Civ App 424 113 S W 304 A fortiori equity will not usually enjoin a thing which is not but may become a nuisance Thus an injunction was not issued to prevent the construction of a cotton gin admitted to be a useful and necessary business although plaintiff could establish that by its erection the air in his home would probably be rendered impure Royse v Martin 75 Ala 510 51 Am Rep 463 So where defendant was about to drill a gas well near plaintiffs premises the court would not enjoin the drilling on the ground that the con templated injuries complained of were not inevitable but merely doubt ful and contingent Windfall Mfg Co v Patterson 148 Ind 414 47 N E 2 37 L R A 381 62 Am St Rep 532 In cases which seek to enjoin alleged nuisances where there is an apparent conflict of rights locality is usually the determining factor Gose v Coryell 59 Tex Civ App 504 126 S W 1164 Thus where defendant built a machine shop in an exclusive residential section of a city the court enjoined it as being a nuisance McMorran v Fitz gerald 106 Mich 649 64 N W 569 58 Am St Rep 511 On the other hand where an injunction was sought against a coffin manufacturing company in a city on account of smoke and cinders from the factory it was denied the court admitting the inconveniences complained of but holding that they were mere incidents of city life Louisville Coffin Co v Warren 78 Ky 400 See Bentley v Empire Portland Cement Co 96 N Y Supp 831 662RECENT DECISIONS 663 Persons seeking to have nuisances enjoined usually rely on the maxim Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas which is at the basis of all suits for injunctions on account of nuisances Ross v Butler 19 N J Eq 294 97 Am Dec 654 Rouse v Martin supra But the interests of the public often require the application of the converse which is equally sound that the plaintiff is without this remedy if for example he deliberately settles in that part of a town already devoted to offensive but lawful enterprises otherwise many manufactories and other industries es sential to the industrial development of a city could be summarily stopped Gilbert v Showerman 23 Mich 448 Similar reasons were given in denying an injunction against a cotton ginning company the court declaring the interests of the public paramount to those of the plain tiff Strieber v Ward Tex Civ App 196 S W

can be fixed at which children shall be excluded from testifying State v Tolla 72 N J L 515 62 Atl 675 3 L R A N S 523 The mental capacity required consists of ability to receive just im pressions of facts to which the testimony relates and ability to relate such facts correctly People v Bernal 10 Cal 66 Wade v State 50 Ala 164 A further requirement is the appreciation of the nature and obligation of an oath McGuff v State 88 Ala 147 7 So 35 16 Am St Rep 25 Flanagin v State 25 Ark 92 This does not imply however that the child must be able to define the word oath or understand the legal nature

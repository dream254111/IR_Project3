for the suppression of sleeping sickness Throughout the country efforts will be made to exterminate the tsetse fly which is supposed to be the cause of the disease The natives to the estimated number of 20000 are to be removed from the flyinfested district on the shores of Lake Victoria to healthful locations inland The sick are to be placed in segregation camps where they will undergo the socalled atoxyl treatment The landingstages along the shore of Victoria Nyanza will be freed from the tsetse fly by means of the complete clearance of all vegetation Fords ferries and waterholes will be similarly dealt with The native chiefs appear to appreciate fully the importance of the matter and are cooperating loyally with the Government in helping to stamp out the terrible scourge of Central Africa E H AMERICA WATERRESOURCES INVESTIGATIONSDuring the fiscal year 19078 the water resources branch of the Geological Survey will carry on measurements of the quantity of water in important streams at over 600 gauging stations in fortytwo States In California Washington Oregon and Maine the work will be in co operation with the States but many stations will be maintained by the Survey for the Reclamation Service in connection with irrigation projects Specialground water investigations will be carried on in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains GEOLOGIC SURVEYS IN NEW JERSEYThe survey of the geology of the New Jersey highlands is being continued this year by the United States Geological Survey the work having been assigned to W S Bayley Mr Bayley expects to finish the field work on the Greenwood Lake and Ramapo quadrangles before the close of the season A STUDY OF AMERICAN INDIAN GAMESThe Twentyfourth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology 190203 just issued contains besides the administrative report only a single paper a monographic study of American Indian Games by Mr Stewart Culin of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences He began the collection of the data in 1903 in collaboration with the late Mr F HCushing whose illhealth however prevented him from doing more than to offer advice and suggestions Under the studies of Mr Culin the prevalent notion that Igames of chance are trivial and of little significance as a subject of research gives way to an appreciation of their importance as a part of human culture He finds that the Indians of both sexes play games of chance persistently and with utter recklessness as to the wagers laid and yet these games are intimately connected with religious beliefs and practices and have among all tribes a devotional aspect and in some cases are of divinatory significance Thus his study of Indian games is not only an exposition of their technology but also contributes to an appreciation of native modes of thought and of the motives and impulses that underlie the conduct of primitive peoples Over 800 small quarto pages profusely illustrated and well indexed are given 555Geographical Record to this description of the numerous Indian games The author received important assistance from many workers and several museums the material was found to be enormous and the letterpress is illustrated by xxI2 figures The volume contains a classified and illustrated list of practically all the American Indian gaming implements in American and European museums with a more or less exhaustive summary of the entire literature of the subject The collection is confined to games in which implements are used RELATIVE HUMIDITY CHARTS OF THE UNITED STATESIn x880 Professor Elias Loomis published the first chart of relative humidity for the United States On this chart which was based on observations made during January I875 only four humidity lines were drawn but two important facts were clearly shown First the general north and south trend of the lines over the Great Plains second that east of the Rocky Mountains there is a belt of territory where the mean relative humidity is less than onehalf to quote Loomiss statement Later charts for January July and for the year were published the latest ones being those in the Report of the Chief of the Weather Bureau for 190102 We now have the first relative humidity charts for each month drawn by Kenneth S Johnson of Harvard University and published in the Report of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science for x906 pp I61I68 Cape Town 19o7 These charts are based on data for the uniform period of 14 years 1888I901 pub lished in the Report of the Chief of the Weather Bureau for 190102 p 318 The curves are drawn for differences of xo per cent only for the sake of clearness in presenting the main facts Furthermore the length of the records is not sufficient to warrant greater detail Among the most striking features shown on the charts is the uniform high relative humidity along the coasts in contrast with which is the extremely low relative humidity in the southwestern interior especially in Arizona Nevada southeastern California and the adjacent districts While the high relative humidity on the coasts remains fairly constant through out the year the low in the interior basin becomes more marked as summer ap proaches thereby increasing the already strong relative humidity gradient between the Pacific coast and the interior Another interesting fact is the annual movement of the lines in the northern part of the interior basin These travel north in summer reaching the northern limit in June or July returning south or perhaps entirely disappearing in winter Among other features worthy of note is the distorting effect of the Great Lakes where the relative humidity tends to remain at or near 8o an effect quite similar to that produced by the oceans Alsoa thing which rarely occursthere is a prevailing north and south trend of the lines over the Great Plains originally pointed out by Loomis as above noted in the vicinity of the tooth meridian show ing that the relative humidity there does not vary with latitude R DEC W CINDER CONE NATIONAL MONUMENTThe President has issued a proclama tion declaring that the area in the Lassen Peak National Forest California which embraces Cinder Cone the Lava Field Snag Lake and Lake Bidwell is reserved from private appropriation and use and set apart as a national monument It is to be known as the Cinder Cone National Monument The proclamation was issued by authority of an act of Congress approved on June 8 x906 entitled An Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities The act authorizes the President in his discretion to declare historic landmarks historic and prehistoric structures and other objects of historic or scientific inter 556Geographical Record est on lands owned or controlled by the Government to be national monuments and to reserve them from private use and to prevent unauthorized persons from settling upon the lands or from appropriating injuring or destroying any feature of the national monuments The area now set apart as the Cinder Cone National Monument is described in the Lassen Peak Folio of the Geologic Atlas Folio 15 It is situated near the southern terminus of the Cascade Range Cinder Cone is about ten miles northeast of Lassen Peak The cone rises about 640 feet above the river plain in which it stands is dull black in colour and composed of scoriae lapilli and sand On the summit of the cone is a welldeveloped crater with a depth of 240 feet The lava field which encircles the Cinder Cone on three sides covers an area of about one by two and onethird miles ends abruptly on all sides and is in many places over Ioo feet in height Snag Lake was formed by the damming up of the stream that flowed through the plain by the lava field Lake Bidwell on the other side of the lava was once much larger than it is today a part of its area having been covered by the lava field This district has been reserved as a monument because its features as above mentioned are of great scientific inter est as illustrations of volcanic activity which are of special importance in tracing the history of the volcanic phenomena of that vicinity OASES IN THE ATACAMA DESERTDr Simon contributes to Der Tropenpflanzer No 6 1907 a paper entitled Oasenkultur in der chilenischen Wiiste Atacama in which he describes some of the oases in the desert where nitrates are the great product Pica and Matilla are the most important oases The supply of drink ing water for Iquique is piped from Pica over sixty miles These oases are fed by underground water coming from the cordilleras on the east Intensive agri culture is carried on in the oases and the product though limited in quantity is very important to the thousands of men engaged in the nitrate industry who would be compelled to live chiefly on preserved foods if it were not for the vege tables and fruit received from Pica and Matilla Pica wine a heavy sweet wine resembling madeira or port is widely known throughout Chile Alfalfa is a large crop and is cut five times a year supplying fodder to the cattle and the draft animals in the nitrate service A number of the oases also grow species of acacia which make excellent fuel This culture is important in a region whose main industry requires large quanti ties of fuel EXPLORING THE PILCOMAYOThe Pilcomayo River in its lower course is the boundary between Paraguay and the Argentine Republic It crosses the extensive plain of the Gran Chaco which is inhabited by the Chiriguanos Mataguayos Tobas and other Indian tribes For generations the navigability of the Pilcomayo has been a vexed question and it was while Crevaux was trying to solve the problem that he was assassinated in I882 by the Tobas In 1905 according to La Geographie Mr Gunnar Lange a Norwegian en gineer studied the navigation of the Pilcomayo from its confluence with the Para guay to the colony Buena Ventura near 22 S Lat He says that the river is not navigable all the year because of the shallowness of its lower part and bar riers of vegetation above Junta Fontana During most of the year however it is accessible to boats drawing not more than a meter It would not be expensive to keep the channel free of logs and vegetation and dams and locks would pro vide sufficient water through the shallows 557Geographical Record In the middle region where the river is no longer navigable but is divided into small shallow streams a canal of about 2700 meters would connect with the Dorado on which boats might reach the upper Pilcomayo Mr Lange thinks it would not be very costly to fit the Pilcomayo for navigation for at least 500 kilo meters from its confluence with the Paraguay Mr W Herrmann who was studying the middle course of the Pilcomayo last year wrote from the lower river in September Zeitsch Berlin Geog Soc No 10 I906 that he had surveyed it between Lat 24 and 22 S and this stretch of the river is navigable for small boats He had been informed that this was the case as far up the river as San Francisco in Bolivia near Lat 21 S and he expected to examine this matter on his return He says that the maps of Thouar Campos and Fontana are very erroneous EXPLORATION OF THE RIO TIETEThe Geographical and Geological Commis sion of Sao Paulo Brazil has issued another of the beautiful Reports describing the very detailed exploration and survey of the larger rivers of the State The report a large folio in form contains a description of the Rio Tiete illustrated with many admirable photographs and detailed maps These reports are among the most noteworthy accounts of recent exploration in America EUROPE THE NINTH INTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL CONGRESSThe Committee on Or ganization of the Ninth International Geographical Congress which will be held in Geneva July 27Aug 6 1908 has arranged ten excursions some of which will occur before the Conigress meets and the others immediately after its adjournment The scientific direction of each has been placed in the hands of a competent leader who will this summer study the field to be traversed by the excursion in his charge Eight or ten days will be the extreme limit of these excursions The programme of excursions will be given in a preliminary circular and later in more detail in a pamphlet to be issued in January I908 which will contain scientific and bibliographical information relating to the excursions and the cost to the participants The excursions will be given to the study of the morphological phenomena of the Alps superficial deposits in the foreAlps and the limestone and crystalline High Alps economic forestry at high altitudes structure of the Jura the plateau and the Alps following a transversal profile in the three regions botanical ex cursions among the limestone Alps and the mountains around Lake Geneva the study of glacial morphology especially the contrasts between the regions which were covered by ancient glaciers and those which were not for the comparative study of fluvial and glacial erosion for the study of the structure of the northern part of the crystalline Alps and for the study of chemical erosion The Committee on Organization will receive offers of papers under the con ditions previously prescribed until Nov 30 1907 Copies of the circular of invi tation the preliminary programme etc may be obtained by addressing the Com mittee on Organization of the Ninth International Geographical Congress Athenee Geneva Switzerland Le Globe No 2 1907 has a long report of the recent meeting of the Committee in which these arrangements were made IDENTITY OF LEUCAS ISLAND WITH ANCIENT ITHACAIn x904 Emperor Wil liam II of Germany provided the means for a topographic survey of the island of Leucas in the Ionian Archipelago as a contribution to the study of the question 558Geographical Record whether Leucas is identical with the Homeric island of Ithaca as has been re cently maintained by Dorpfeld and other archaeologists It is well known that some students hold the view that Homer drew upon his imagination for his de scriptions of Ithaca the island home of Ulysses while others have held that the ancient Ithaca was identical with the small modern island of that name Under the auspices of the Emperor a party consisting of Captain Walther von Mar6es Prof Wilhelm Dorpfeld of the Archaeological Institute of Athens and Lieut Nonne began the survey and study of Leucas in March 1905 The result is a folio of forty pages accompanying a portfolio of six maps in colours and well produced the whole published under the title Karten von Leucas Beitrage zur Frage LeukasIthaka The text and maps are by Captain Marees A number of excellent photographs of various parts of the island illustrate the conclusions which the investigators reached A study was made of the geology topography and meteorology of the island The investigations show that within the historic period Leucas must always have been an island instead of having been attached to the mainland Many data were collected showing striking resemblances between parts of the island and its coasts and ancient Ithaca as described in the Odyssey Captain von Marees says that the present appearance and conditions of Leucas prove that it was the topo graphic background of the Odyssey that Leucas is the Homeric Ithaca and that the author of the poem knew the island well THE DEVELOPMENT OF TURINThe population of this city has quintupled since 1813 It numbered only 45000 inhabitants in 1706 In 1796 the population was 93000 The Napoleonic period was detrimental to its prosperity and the population fell to 65588 in x813 Its population in 1905 was 36I317 Turin is one of the most healthful of cities The average annual deathrate from 1901 to 1905 was only 1667 per x000 inhabitants STATISTICS OF THE GERMAN EMPIREThe Statistisches Jahrbuch fur das Deutsche Reich for 1907 issued by the Imperial Statistical Office Berlin is as usual a model of firstclass statistical compilation and arrangement All the information it contains is readily accessible The twentyfour groups in which the tables are arranged include the statistics of popnlation agriculture fisheries animal industries manufacturinig communications internal and external com merce money prices consumption of materials public schools prices of labour labour organization medicine and hygiene sport meteorological data the pro tectorates and an appendix summarizing international statistics with diagrams showing the sea trade of the leading worldports AUSTRALIA CLIMATE AND VEGETATION IN AUSTRALIAThe general relations of climate and vegetation in Australia are clearly emphasized in a recent book by Dr L Diels Die Pflanzenwelt von WestAustralien siidlich des Wendekreis Engelmann Leipzig I906 which forms Part VII of a larger memoir entitled Die Vegetation der Erde In the interior is an extensive plateau arid with few rivers On the east there are high mountains descending abruptly to the ocean while on the other coasts the descent is more gradual In the north the climate is tropical with summer monsoon rains in the south it is more temperate with winter subtropical rains Tropical forests are found in a few restricted areas between the eastern mountains and the sea especially on the Bellenden Kerr Range re 559Geographical Record sembling the tropical forests of Africa South America and the Malay Peninsula Here the rainfall is heavy and occurs throughout the year In southeastern Vic toria and Tasmania there is also forest growth in the temperate climates of those regions there being many trees here which are not found in the tropical rainforest On the uplands of Victoria and also more extensively in the extreme southern angle of Western Australia a third form of forest is found the Sclero phyll or evergreen forest and bush Most of the continent is subject to droughts and straggling trees occur in groups along watercourses or wherever they can find moisture Eucalypti are found under all conditions in the lofty forests in the widelydispersed Blue Gum scrubs on the grass lands and as lowly scrubby trees in the more arid interior country or on the exposed mountain slopes The leaves are set edgewise and the buds are protected by a lid which falls off as the buds open The following scheme of vegetation types shows the characteristic variation with rainfall from the tropical rainforest to the desert TYPE OF VEGETATION PRINCIPAL TREE UNDER SHRUBS SURFACE VEGETATION Tropical rainforest Mixture of heavy trees Numerous shrubs No grass Temperate rainforest Eucalyptus dominant A few

No 3 I907 on his journeys chiefly for anthropological study in German British and Dutch New Guinea occupying nearly two years 19041906 He travelled around nearly three fourths of the island residing for some months at five different places His longest stay was at Potsdamhafen and its neighbourhood on the north coast of German New Guinea where he made a study of the Monumbo and also visited the Alepapun who are hostile to the Monumbo and live twodays march in the interior Though the Germans have occupied Potsdamhafen for years the Alepa pun were unknown to them and Dr Poch was in virgin territory when he reached them Many similar cases might be mentioned Dr Poch attributes the fact that so much of New Guinea is still unknown to the great difficulties of travel and the unfriendliness of the natives He found that the words of songs with which the Monumbo accompany their dances are not understood by them They told him that they derived these songs from the Watam whom he visited and found that they also did not understand the songs but the words they said came down to them from their fathers He believes that these words are from a lost language and have been handed down by tradition He spent some time at Merauke the military post recently established by the 560Geographical Record Dutch Government near the southeast corner of Dutch New Guinea The post owes its origin to a protest from the British Government relating to the greatly feared head hunters who cross the border from Dutch territory to kill natives in the British domain From this part of the Dutch coast nothing can be seen but a flat plain stretching to the horizon The unfavourable conditions of navigation and the wild character of the natives have discouraged Malay sailors from visit ing the coast and not even the widelydistributed hen of the Malay archipelago is known there Along the coast are villages of from 80 to 120 huts each the distance between the villages being not more than a half hours walk The KajaKaja who inhabit them are head hunters with peculiarities of their own The use of the pot in cookery is unknown and all food is roasted at an open fire The men live together in huts while the women and children occupy huts by themselves Before one of the warriors kills an enemy he seeks if possible to learn his name which the conqueror givesto his own son POLAR THE BRITISH ANTARCTIC ExPEDITIONLieutenant Shackleton gives in the Scottish Geographical Magazine July I907 more precise details of the plans for his Antarctic expedition than the first announcement contained BULL April 1907 p 237 He has selected King Edward VII Land at the eastern end of Rosss Great Ice Barrier as the base of operations instead of Victoria Land at the western end of the barrier The Newfoundland sealing steamer Nimrod of 250 net tonnage with capacity for 300 tons of coal in addition to all supplies has been purchased She will leave England about the end of July and magnetic observations will be taken during the trip to New Zealand Lieut Shackleton will leave the vessel at Madeira but will rejoin her at Lyttelton N Z from which port she will sail south about the first week in the new year The expe dition will probably include twentyeight members of whom twelve will be the landingparty at King Edward VII Land which it is hoped to reach by Feb x The Nimrod will return to New Zealand and will be devoted for eight or nine months to a magnetic survey between New Zealand Australia and the east coast of Africa The exploring party will place on King Edward VII Land a wellplanned liv ing hut twelve Siberian ponies a team of twelve picked dogs and a specially constructed motor car Before winter closes in it is hoped a line of supply depots will be established at least 50o geographical miles to the south It is expected that the winter quarters on King Edward VII Land will be in about 77 30 S Lat or 750 geographical miles from the pole Throughout the work scientific investi gation will be coupled with exploration and during the year in the far south the geologist the biologist and the magnetician will devote themselves entirely to their special researches within a radius of 00oo miles or so from winter quarters In the spring efforts will be made to extend the line of depots another ioo miles to the south A party limited to three members will attempt to reach the south pole using six of the Siberian ponies and the motor car Great hopes are entertained of the value of the motor car for traction purposes but its employ ment is recognized as an experiment As a final resort dogs will be used A second party of three will penetrate to the southeast behind the coast of King Edward VII Land while three other men will try to follow the coast east in the direction of Alexander Land So little is known of all this region that these 561Geographical Record journeys can hardly fail to prove fruitful The return of the Nimrod to take the explorers home has been fixed for about the end of January I909 COMMANDER PEARYS EXPEDITIONThe following statement published in the Necw York Herald of August I2 explains itself NEW YORK CITY August 10 1907 Owing to the failure of the contractors for the Roosevelts new boilers to live up to their agree ment the main expedition of the Peary Arctic Club will be postponed for a year and the Roosevelt when the work of repairs is completed will go north on a flying trip to deposit my proposed coal dep6t at Etah Greenland returning the last of September In this connection it is proper to state that the contract for the construction and installation of the two new boilers for the Roosevelt was made upon the assurance of the contractors that the work should be completed on June x and this provision was embodied in the contract As a matter of fact the boilers are only just completed and the installation has yet to be done This will require several days and put the departure of the main expedition so late in the season as to be inadvisable The question of funds does not and has not entered into this unfortunate situation The contract for the work was guaranteed and all payments

OF THOSE ANIMALS BY JOHN HUNTER F R S,I206929,205 XXIX AN ACCOUNT OF CERTAIN RECEPTACLES OF AIR IN BIRDS WHICH COMMUNICATE WITH THE LUNGS AND ARE LODGED BOTH AMONG THE FLESHY PARTS AND IN THE HOLLOW BONES OF THOSE ANIMALS BY JOHN HUN TER F R S T H E SINGULAR COMMUNICATIONS WHICH ARE FOUND TO SUBSIST IN BIRDS BETWEEN THE CAVITIES OF THE LUNGS AND CERTAIN OTHER CAVITIES IN THE FLESHY PARTS AND IN THE BONES BEING PECULIAR TO THAT TRIBE OF ANIMALS AND HAVING NEVER YET BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED NOR PERHAPS ATTENDED TO EITHER BY ANA TOMISTS OR NATURAL HISTORIANS I IMAGINE THAT AN AC COUNT OF THEM WILL NOT BE UNACCEPTABLE TO THIS SOCIETY IT IS NOT MY PRESENT DESIGN TO ENTER INTO MINUTE DESCRIPTIONS OF ALL THE PARTICULAR COMMUNICATIONS OF THIS SORT TO BE FOUND IN THE DISSECTION OF THESE ANI MALS BUT ONLY TO MENTION SUCH GENERAL FACTS AS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT INTO NATURAL HISTORY AND SERVE TO OPEN THE ENQUIRY INTO THE FINAL CAUSE TO MAKE THIS MATTER MORE INTELLIGIBLE I MUST PREVIOUSLY GIVE AN IDEA OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PARTICULAR CELLS IN QUESTION AND THOSE OTHER CELLS OF THE CELLULAR MEMBRANE COMMON TO ALL ANIMALS AND206 AND ALSO SHEW WHEREIN THOSE BONES WHICH RECEIVE AIR DIFFER FROM SUCH AS DO NO THE AIRCELLS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE SOFT PARTS OF BIRDS HAVE NO COMMUNICATION WITH THE CAVITY OF THE COMMON CELLULAR MEMBRANE OF THE BODY SOME OF THEM COMMUNICATE IMMEDIATELY WITH ONE ANO THER AND ALL OF THEM MAY BE SAID TO HAVE A COM MUNICATION TOGETHER BY MEANS OF THE LUNGS AS A COMMON CENTRE SOME OF THESE ARE BAGS PLACED IN LARGER CAVITIES SUCH AS THE ABDOMEN OTHERS ARE SO LODGED IN THE INTERSTICES OF PARTS THAT THEY WOULD AT FIRST APPEAR TO BE THE COMMON CONNECTING MEM BRANE AS ABOUT THE BREAST AXILLA C THEY ARE OF VERY DIFFERENT SIZES JUST AS BEST SUITS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR PARTS WHERE THEY ARE PLACED THE BONES WHICH RECEIVE AIR ARE OF TWO KINDS SOME AS THE STERNUM RIBS AND VERTEBRAE HAVE THEIR INTERNAL SUBSTANCE DIVIDED INTO INNUMERABLE CELLS WHILST OTHERS AS THE OS HUMERI AND THE OS SE MORIS ARE HOLLOWED OUT INTO ONE LARGE CANAL SOME TIMES WITH A FEW BONY COLUMNS RUNNING ACROSS AT THE EXTREMITIES BONES OF THIS KIND MAY BE DISTIN GUISHED FROM THOSE THAT DO NOT RECEIVE AIR BY SEVERAL MARKS 1ST BY THEIR LESS SPECIFIC GRAVITY 2DLY BY BEING LESS VASCULAR THAN THE OTHERS AND THEREFORE WHITER 3DLY BY THEIR CONTAINING LITTLE OR NO OIL AND CONSEQUENTLY BEING MORE EASILY CLEANED AND APPEARING MUCH WHITER WHEN CLEANED THAN COMMON BONES 4THLY BY HAVING NO MARROW NOR A BLOODY PULPY SUBSTANCE EVEN IN THEIR CELLS 5THLY BY THEIR NOT BEING IN GENERAL SO HARD AND FIRM AS OTHER BONES THOSE OF SOME BIRDS ARE SO SOFT THAT THEY CAN BE SQUEEZED207 SQUEEZED TOGETHER WITH THE FINGER AND THUMB HOWEVER THE BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES HAVE VERY SOLID SIDES 6THLY THE PASSAGE BY WHICH THE AIR GETS INTO THE BONES CAN BE EASILY PERCEIVED EVEN IN CLEANED BONES GENERALLY THERE ARE SEVERAL HOLES PLACED TOGETHER NEAR THE END OF THE BONE WHICH IS NEXT THE TRUNK OF THE BIRD AND DISTINGUISHABLE BY HAVING THEIR EXTERNAL EDGES ROUNDED OFF WHICH IS NOT THE CASE WITH THOSE HOLES THROUGH WHICH EITHER NERVES OR BLOOD VESSELS PASS INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BONE I MUST NEXT GIVE AN IDEA OF THE MECHANISM OF THE LUNGS IN BIRDS WHICH RENDERS THEM FIT FOR COM MUNICATING AIR TO THE ABOVE DESCRIBED PARTS THIS CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY IN CERTAIN CONNEXIONS IT HAS BEEN ASSERTED THAT BIRDS HAVE NO DIAPHRAGM BUT THIS OPINION MUST HAVE ARISEN EITHER FROM A WANT OF OBSERVATION OR FROM TOO CONFINED AN IDEA OF A DIAPHRAGM FOR THERE IS A PRETTY STRONG BUT THIN AND TRANSPARENT MEMBRANE WHICH COVERS THE LOWER SURFACE OF THE LUNGS AND ADHERES TO THEM THIS MEMBRANE GIVES INSERTION TO SEVERAL THIN MUSCLES WHICH ARISE FROM THE INNER SURFACES OF THE RIBS THE USE OF THIS PART IS TO LESSEN THE CONCAVITY OF THE LUNGS TOWARDS THE ABDOMEN AT THE TIME OF IN SPIRATION AND THEREBY TO ASSIST IN DILATING THE AIR CELLS FOR WHICH REASON IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS ANSWERING ONE MAIN PURPOSE OF A DIAPHRAGM BESIDES THIS ATTACHMENT OF THE LUNGS TO THE DIA PHRAGM THEY ARE ALSO CONNECTED TO THE RIBS AND SIDES OF THE VERTEBRAE THESE ADHESIONS ARE PECULIAR TO THIS TRIBE OF ANI MALS AND ARE OF SINGULAR USE OR RATHER OF ABSO LUTE208 LUTE NECESSITY IN SUCH LUNGS AS THOSE OF BIRDS OUT OF WHICH THE AIR CAN FIND A PASSAGE INTO OTHER CAVITIES FOR IF THE LUNGS WERE LOOSE IN THE CAVITY OF THE THORAX AS IS THE CASE IN ALL OTHER ANIMALS THEIR CELLS COULD NOT BE EXPANDED EITHER BY THE DEPRESSION OF THE DIAPHRAGM OR THE ELEVATION OF THE RIBS SINCE THE AIR RUSHING IN TO FILL UP THE VACUUM IN THE CAVITY OF THE CHEST OCCASIONED BY THESE ACTIONS WOULD TAKE THE STRAIGHT ROAD FROM THE TRACHEA THROUGH THOSE PASSAGES AND OF CONSEQUENCE EXPAND NO PART OF THE LUNGS WHICH LAY OUT OF THAT LINE WHEREBY RESPIRATION WOULD BE TOTALLY PREVENTED IT WOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME CASE AS WHEN THE LUNGS ARE SO MUCH WOUNDED IN OTHER ANIMALS AS TO ALLOW OF A FREE PASSAGE FOR THE AIR INTO THE CAVITY OF THE THORAX C OF THE INTERNAL OPENINGS OF THE LUNGS THE OPENINGS IN THE LUNGS BY WHICH THEY COM MUNICATE AIR TO THE OTHER PARTS ARE AS FOLLOW THE MEMBRANE OR DIAPHRAGM ABOVE MENTIONED IS PERFORATED IN SEVERAL PLACES WITH PRETTY LARGE HOLES WHICH ADMIT OF A FREE PASSAGE BETWEEN THE CELLS OF THE LUNGS AND THE ABDOMEN A COMMUNI CATION WHICH HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN NOTICED TO EACH OF THESE PERFORATIONS IS JOINED A DISTINCT MEMBRANOUS BAG WHICH IS EXTREMELY THIN AND TRANSPARENT IT RECEIVES THE AIR AND BEING AFTER WARDS CONTINUED THROUGH THE ABDOMEN GETS ATTACH MENTS TO MANY OF THOSE PARTS WITH WHICH IT COMES IN CONTACT 5 THERE209 THERE IS NO OCCASION TO DESCRIBE HERE ALL THESE BAGS OR THEIR ATTACHMENTS IT BEING SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT THEY EXTEND OVER THE WHOLE ABDOMEN THE LUNGS OPEN AT THEIR ANTERIOR PART THAT IS TOWARDS THE STERNUM INTO CERTAIN MEMBRANOUS CELLS WHICH LIE UPON THE SIDES OF THE PERICARDIUM AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE CELLS OF THE STERNUM THE SUPERIOR PART OF THE LUNGS OPENS INTO THE LARGE CELLS OF A LOOSE NETWORK THROUGH WHICH THE TRACHEA OESOPHAGUS AND LARGE VESSELS GOING FROM AND COMING TO THE HEART PASS WHEN THESE CELLS ARE DISTENDED WITH AIR IT EN CREASES THE SIZE OF THAT PART WHERE THEY LIE VERY CONSIDERABLY WHICH IN GENERAL IS A MARK OF PAS SION AS APPEARS EVIDENTLY IN THE TURKEYCOCK THE POUTINGPIDGEON C AND IS EXTREMELY VISIBLE IN THE BREAST OF A GOOSE WHEN SHE CACKLES THESE CELLS COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS IN THE AXILLA UNDER THE LARGE PECTORAL MUSCLE C AND THOSE AGAIN WITH THE CAVITY OF THE OS HUMERI BY MEANS OF SMALL OPENINGS IN THE HOLLOW SURFACE NEAR THE HEAD OF THAT BONE THE POSTERIOR EDGES OF THE LUNGS WHICH LIE ON THE SIDES OF THE SPINE AND PROJECT BACKWARDS BETWEEN THE RIBS OPEN INTO THE CELLS OF THE BODIES OF THE VERTEBRAE THOSE OF THE RIBS THE CANAL OF THE ME DULLA SPINALIS THE CELLS OF THE SACRUM AND OTHER BONES OF THE PELVIS FROM WHICH PARTS THE AIR FINDS A PASSAGE TO THE CAVITY OF THE THIGHBONE THIS ACCOUNT AGREES WITH WHAT WE FIND IN MOST BIRDS THOUGH SOME HAVE MORE AND SOME SEWER OF THESE COMMUNICATIONS V O L LXIV E E IN210 IN THE O S T R I C H NO AIR GETS INTO THE OS HUMERI BUT IT ENTERS EVERY OTHER PART AS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN VERY LARGE QUANTITIES IN THE COMMON F O W L NO AIR APPEARS TO ENTER ANY BONE BUT THE OS HUMERI THE W O O D  C O C K HAS NONE EITHER IN THE FIRST BONE OF THE WING OR IN THE THIGHBONES ON THE OTHER HAND IN THE P E L I C A N THE AIR PASSES ON TO THE ULNA AND RADIUS AND INTO THOSE BONES WHICH ANSWER TO THE CARPUS AND METACARPUS OF QUADRUPEDS THUS THEN THE ABDOMEN THE CELLS SURROUNDING THE PERICARDIUM THE LOWER AND SORE PART OF THE NECK THE AXILLA THE CELLULAR MEMBRANE UNDER THE PECTORAL MUSCLES C ALL COMMUNICATE WITH THE LUNGS AND ARE CAPABLE OF BEING FILLED WITH AIR AND AGAIN FROM THOSE CELLS THE STERNUM RIBS VERTEBRAE OF THE BACK AND LOINS BONES OF THE PELVIS OSSA HUMERORUM AND OSSA FEMORUM CAN IN MANY BIRDS BE FURNISHED WITH AIR THIS SUPPLY OF THE BONES WITH AIR IS NOT WHOLLY BY MEANS OF THE LUNGS FOR THE CELLS OF THE BONES OF THE HEAD IN SOME BIRDS ARE FILLED WITH IT OF WHICH THE O W L IS A REMARKABLE INSTANCE IN THIS BIRD THE DIPLOE BETWEEN THE TWO PLATES OF THE SCULL IS CELLULAR AND ADMITS A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF AIR WHICH IS FURNISHED BY THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE SOME AUTHORS CONSIDERED THE DIPLOE IN THE CRANIUM OF A BIRD AS A CONTINUATION OF THE MAMILLARY PRO CESS  AND HAVE LOOKED UPON IT AS A CIRCUMSTANCE PECULIAR TO SINGING BIRDS BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE  THE ONLY THING SIMILAR TO THIS COMMUNICATION IN BIRDS OF THE CELLS OF BONES WITH THE EXTERNAL AIR IS THAT OF THE INTERNAL EAR OF QUADRUPEDS BY THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE 3 THE211 THE LOWER JAW OF THE P E L I C A N IS ALSO FURNISHED WITH AIR BUT BY WHAT MEANS I DO NOT KNOW HAVING FORMERLY OBSERVED THESE FACTS I MADE SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS IN THE YEAR 1758 UPON THE BREATHING OF BIRDS TO PROVE THE FREE COMMUNICA TION BETWEEN THE LUNGS AND THE ABOVEMENTIONED PARTS THE FIRST WAS UPON A C O C K I MADE AN OPENING INTO THE BELLY OF THIS ANIMAL AND INTRODUCED A SILVER CANNULA THEN TIED UP THE TRACHEA AND FOUND THAT HE BREATHED BY THIS OPENING AND LIVED BUT AN INFLAMMATION CAME ON IN THE BOWELS WHICH PRO DUCED ADHESIONS AND CUT OFF THE COMMUNICATION I CUT THE WING THROUGH THE OS HUMERI IN ANOTHER FOWL AND TIED UP THE TRACHEA AS IN THE COCK AND FOUND THAT THE AIR PASSED TO AND FROM THE LUNGS BY THE CANAL IN THIS BONE THE SAME EXPERIMENT WAS MADE WITH THE OS FEMORIS OF A YOUNG H A W K WHICH WAS ATTENDED WITH NEARLY THE LIKE SUCCESS BUT THE PASSAGE OF AIR THROUGH BOTH THESE PARTS ESPECIALLY THE LAST WAS ATTENDED WITH MORE DIFFICULTY THAN IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT INDEED SO MUCH AS TO RENDER IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ANIMAL TO LIVE LONGER THAN TO PROVE EVIDENTLY THAT HE DID BREATHE THROUGH THE CUT BONE THE EXCEEDING SINGULARITY OF THESE COMMUNICA TIONS IN BIRDS PUT ME UPON THINKING WHAT COULD BE THE FINAL CAUSE AT FIRST I SUSPECTED THAT IT MIGHT BE INTENDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF FLYING THAT BEING THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH APPEARS THE MOST PECULIAR TO BIRDS AND IT MIGHT BE OF SERVICE IN THIS RESPECT I THOUGHT BY ENCREASING THE VOLUME AND STRENGTH WITH THE SAME QUANTITY OF MATTER AND THEREFORE E E 2 WITHOUT212 WITHOUT ADDING TO THE WEIGHT OF THE WHOLE WHICH WILL RATHER INDEED BE DIMINISHED BY THE DIFFERENCE OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL AND IN TERNAL AIR THIS OPINION WAS STRENGTHENED BY OB SERVING THAT THE FEATHERS OF BIRDS ALSO CONTAIN A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF AIR AND IN THE VERY PART WHICH REQUIRES THE GREATEST STRENGTH AS LIKEWISE BY THE ANALOGY OF FISH WHICH HAVE AIR CONTAINED IN THEIR BODIES TO LESSEN THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY THOUGH THE USE OF THIS IN FISH WHICH ARE TO MOVE IN A MUCH HEAVIER ELEMENT IS MORE OBVIOUS THAN IN BIRDS BUT WHEN I FOUND THE O S T R I C H WHICH IS NOT IN TENDED TO FLY ENDOWED WITH NEARLY THE SAME CON STRUCTION AND THAT THE COMMON F O W L AND MANY OTHERS OF THAT CLASS WHICH DO FLY AND ALSO THE W O O D  C O C K WHICH FLIES AND IS SUPPOSED TO BE A BIRD OF PASSAGE ARE NOT SO WELL PROVIDED WITH AIR AS THE O S T R I C H AND THAT THE B A T T WHICH FLIES DIF FERS NOT IN THAT WAY FROM ANIMALS THAT DO NOT FLY SO MANY CONTRADICTIONS TO THE THEORY OBLIGED ME TO THINK OF SOME OTHER USE FOR THIS SINGULAR MECHANISM THE NEXT CONJECTURE THAT OFFERED ITSELF WAS THAT THESE PARTS WERE TO BE CONSIDERED AS AN APPENDAGE TO THE LUNGS THE ANALOGY OF AMPHI BIOUS ANIMALS LEADS TO THIS FOR IN MANY OF THEM THE SNAKE VIPER C THE LUNGS ARE CONTINUED DOWN THROUGH THE WHOLE BELLY IN FORM OF TWO BAGS THE UPPER PART ONLY OF WHICH CAN DO THE OFFICE OF RESPIRATION AND THEREFORE THE REMAINDER IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS A RESERVOIR OF AIR NOW THERE IS A GREAT SIMILARITY BETWEEN BIRDS AND THAT CLASS OF ANI MALS213 MALS CALLED AMPHIBIOUS AND ALTHOUGH A BIRD AND A SNAKE ARE NOT THE SAME IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS YET THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE AIR PASSING BEYOND THE LUNGS INTO THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN IN BOTH NATURALLY LEADS US TO SUPPOSE THAT SO SIMILAR A STRUCTURE IS DESIGNED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE IN BOTH AND THIS ANALOGY IS FURTHER CON FIRMED BY THE TEXTURE OF THE LUNGS IN BOTH WHICH CONSIST OF LARGE CELLS NOW IN AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS THE USE OF THIS CONFORMATION OF THE LUNGS IS EVI DENT FOR IT IS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS THAT THEY CAN BREATHE LESS FREQUENTLY THAN OTHERS CONSIDERING THE MATTER IN THIS LIGHT IT MAY STILL IN BIRDS HAVE SOME CONNEXION WITH FLYING FOR THAT MOTION MAY EASILY BE IMAGINED TO RENDER FREQUENCY OF RESPIRATION DIFFICULT AND MAY THEREFORE MAKE A RE SERVOIR OF AIR SINGULARLY USEFUL IT MAY PERHAPS OCCUR TO SOME THAT THE WHOLE OF THESE COMMUNICATING CELLS ARE TO BE CONSIDERED AS EXTENDED LUNGS BUT I CAN HARDLY THINK THAT ANY AIR WHICH GETS BEYOND THE VESICULATED LUNGS THEM SELVES IS CAPABLE OF AFFECTING THE BLOOD OF THE ANI MAL AS THE OTHER CAVITIES INTO WHICH IT COMES AS WELL THOSE OF THE SOFT PARTS AS OF THE BONES ARE VERY LITTLE VASCULAR HOW FAR THIS CONSTRUCTION OF THE RESPIRATORY OR GANS MAY ASSIST BIRDS IN SINGING IS WORTHY OF CONSI DERATION AS THE VAST CONTINUANCE OF SONG BETWEEN THE BREATHINGS IN A C A N A R Y  B I R D WOULD APPEAR TO BE OWING TO THIS CAUSE AT PRESENT I SHALL PURSUE THIS SUBJECT NO FARTHER BUT LEAVE IT TO A SUBSEQUENT PAPER AS REQUIRING A GREAT MANY COMPARATIVE FACTS TO ESTABLISH THE FINAL CAUSE XXX

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074665,WHAT SHOULD THE MODERN SECONDARY SCHOOL AIM TO ACCOMPLISH I,I244496,WHAT SHOULD THE MODERN SECONDARY SCHOOL AIM TO ACCOMPLISH I THE SECONDARY SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY ESPECIALLY THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IS JUST BEGINNING TO ASSUME CONSCIOUSLY THE IMPOR TANCE OF AN INDEPENDENT EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION THERE WILL NO DOUBT CONTINUE TO BE HEREAFTER AS THERE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST PREPARATORY SCHOOLS THAT IS SCHOOLS WHOSE AIMS AND WORK ARE DETERMINED WHOLLY BY COLLEGE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS BUT IN GENERAL THE SECONDARY SCHOOL IS NOT DESTINED TO BE A PREPARATORY SCHOOL IT WILL AIM NOT MERELY TO PREPARE FOR EDUCATION IT WILL AIM AT EDUCATION ITSELF THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT MEAN OF COURSE THAT THE SECONDARY SCHOOL WILL AIM TO COMPLETE A HUMAN BEINGS EDUCATION BUT THAT THE SCHOOL WILL DECLINE TO CONTINUE TO DEFER UNTIL THE PUPIL ENTERS COLLEGE THE SPECIFIC TRAINING IN KNOWLEDGE AND POWER WHICH ENABLES HIM TO GET A PROPER ACQUAINTANCE WITH MODERN LIFE ITS PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND THE CORRESPOND ING DEGREE OF POWER TO PARTICIPATE INTELLIGENTLY AND SUCCESSFULLY IN HUMAN AFFAIRS THIS IS THE MEANING OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING CURRICULA OF OUR SECONDARY SCHOOLS BUT THE MOST OBVIOUS RECENT EVIDENCE OF THIS REVISED CONCEPTION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IS THE DEMAND THAT ANY SUBJECTS WELL PURSUED IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL SHALL BE MADE AVAILABLE IN SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO COLLEGE IN OTHER WORDS THE SCHOOLS ARE BEGINNING TO DEMAND THAT WHILE HERETOFORE THEY HAVE VERY GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE COLLEGES IN REGARDING LATIN AND GREEK AS THE MOST VALUABLE SUBJECTS IN THE COURSE OF STUDY FOR ALL SECONDARY SCHOOL PUPILS AND FOR THOSE PUPILS WHO INTENDED TO GO TO COLLEGE IN PARTICULAR THE COLLEGES SHALL NOW FOLLOW THE SCHOOLS IN ABATING THIS EMPHASIS ON THE TRADI READ BEFORE THE MICHIGAN SCHOOLMASTERS CLUB APRIL 2 I897 387THE SCHOOL REVIEW TIONALLY PREFERRED SUBJECTS AND WHEN THEY MAKE THIS DEMAND THEY MAKE IT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PUPILS THEMSELVES THE QUESTION HERE AT ISSUE IS OF COURSE BROADER THAN THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CLASSICS OR MODERN LANGUAGES AND SCIENCE POSSESS THE GREATEST EDUCATIONAL VALUE THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE INDEPENDENT FUNCTION OF MODERN SECONDARY EDUCATION AND WHAT ARE THE FORM AND CONTENT OF THE MOST DESIRABLE PROGRAMME THROUGH WHICH THIS FUNCTION MAY BE FULFILLED  TO THIS QUESTION I INVITE YOUR ATTENTION AT THE OUTSET IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO GLANCE AT THE PRESENT CONDITION AND CONTEMPORARY AIMS OF ELEMENTARY PRESECONDARY EDUCATION IN ORDER THAT WE MAY SEE WHAT THE GROUNDWORK IS ON WHICH THE SECONDARY EDUCATION OF THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE MAY BUILD AND ALSO THAT WE MAY DETERMINE APPROXIMATELY THE TIME LIMITS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION ITSELF IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY CONFINED ITSELF ALMOST ENTIRELY FOR THE FIRST EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OF THE PUPILS SCHOOL LIFE TO THE SCHOOL ARTSREADING WRITING ARITHMETIC AND ENGLISH GRAMMARTOGETHER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF STATISTICAL BOOK GEOGRAPHY AND USUALLY A LITTLE HISTORY AND CIVIL GOVERNMENT THIS CURRICULUM IS RAPIDLY GIVING WAY TO THE MODERN ENRICHED CURRICULUM WITH ITS NATURE STUDY ITS CLAY MODELING ITS DRAWING AND OTHER FORMS OF ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION IN THE FINE ARTS ITS MANUAL TRAINING ITS BIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL STUDIES ITS LITERATURE ITS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ITS MUSIC ITS PHYSICAL TRAINING AND IT IS TOLERABLY CLEAR THAT THESE RAPID CHANGES NOW GOING ON IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COURSES OF STUDY THOUGH DOUBTLESS OFTEN THE RESULT OF MERE IMITATION ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DUE TO CORRESPONDING CHANGES OF AIM IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION FROM THE OLD TO THE NEW THERE IS MUCH CONFUSION MISTAKES ARE DOUBTLESS MADE WE SOMETIMES HAVE A FAULTY AND BELATED ENRICHMENT OF THE LATER YEARS OF THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL COURSE ONLY INSTEAD OF A COMPLETE REVISION AND ENRICHMENT OF THE COURSE FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAVE CONGESTED COURSES AND THE CORRESPONDING SCRAPPY AND SUPERFICIAL WORK WE HAVE MANY TEACHERS POORLY PREPARED OR NOT PREPARED AT ALL TO 388AIM OF THE MIODERN SJECONDARY SCHOOL ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEWER COURSES OF STUDY AND HENCE A JUST ESTIMATE OF WHAT IS OR MAY BE ACCOM PLISHED IS DIFFICULT AND OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE PROFESSION AND EVEN WHOLE COMMUNITIES UNABLE TO SEE THE UNIFYING AIM AND GENERAL PURPOSE WHICH UNDERLIE SPECIFIC CHANGES RECOMMENDED MAY REGARD THESE CHANGES AS FADS AND REFUSE THEIR CONSENT TO HAVE THEM TRIED OR AT LEAST MAY WITH HOLD THEIR SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE OLD NARROW COURSE OF STUDY WITH ITS FORMAL CONTENT AND MECHANICAL ROUTINE IS DOOMED AND THAT A RICHER COURSE OF STUDY WITH A BROADER AND MORE INSPIRING CON CEPTION OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLTEACHERS RESPONSIBILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES IS TAKING ITS PLACE THE OLD CONCEPTION OF THE PROPER FUNCTION OF THE FIRST EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OF THE PUPILS SCHOOL EDUCATION WAS A THOROUGH DRILL IN THE SCHOOL ARTSTHE INSTRUMENTS OF THE ACQUISITION AND EXPRESSION OF KNOWLEDGE THE NEW CON CEPTION THE PRESENT AIM OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EDUCATION SEEMS TO ME TO BE FAIRLY EXPRESSED IN THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ELE MENTARY OR PRESECONDARY SCHOOL EDUCATION SHOULD PROVIDE THE MOST SALUTARY PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PUPIL AND PROMOTE HIS NORMAL PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH APPROPRIATE TRAINING IT SHOULD OPEN THE MIND OF THE CHILD AND AND LET THE WORLD IN IT SHOULD STIMULATE AND GRATIFY CURIOSITY IN EVERY FIELD OF WORTHY HUMAN ACTIVITY AND UTILIZE THIS CURIOSITY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INCIPIENT PERMANENT INTERESTS IN AND POWER OVER THIS KNOWLEDGE IT SHOULD ACQUAINT THE PUPIL WITH HIS DUTIES AND HIS PRIVILEGES AS A TEMPORARILY DEPENDENT MEMBER OF SOCIETY AND PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HABITS OF THOUGHT AND CONDUCT IN HARMONY WITH HIS GROWING INSIGHT AT ABOUT THE AGE OF TWELVE THE PERIOD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SHOULD BEGIN WHAT NOW IS THE FUNCTION OF MODERN SECONDARY EDUCATION  THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION MUST BE SOUGHT IN AN INTERPRETATION OF RECENT CHANGES IN SECONDARY SCHOOL COURSES OF STUDY FOR THESE CHANGES REPRESENT NOT ONLY THE ENDEAVOR OF THE SCHOOLS TO MEET THE MORE OR LESS REASONABLE DEMANDS OF MODERN COMMUNITIES 389THE SCHOOL REVIEW BUT ALSO THE ENDEAVOR ON THE PART OF THINKING PERSONS BOTH TEACHERS AND LAYMEN TO MAKE THE SCHOOLS MINISTER TO WHAT SEEM ON CAREFUL INVESTIGATION TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS AND REAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY AND OF THE INDIVIDUAL IF WE NOW TURN TO THE SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAMMES AS THEY ARE WE FIND THAT DURING THE RECENT PAST THESE PROGRAMMES HAVE SHOWN A RAPIDLY INCREASING TENDENCY TO CHANGE FROM THE OLD SINGLE FIXED CURRICULUM EMBRACING CHIEFLY LATIN GREEK AND MATHEMAT ICS TO TWO OR MORE PARALLEL COURSES OF STUDY COMPRISING MANY OTHER SUBJECTS AS WELL AS ONE OR BOTH OR NEITHER OF THE CLASSICAL LANGUAGES STILL MORE RECENTLY THERE IS A MARKED TENDENCY TO CONVERT ALL THESE COURSES INTO A SINGLE FLEXIBLE COURSE FROM WHICH THE PUPIL MAY UNDER CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS SELECT HIS STUDIES AT WILL THAT IS TO SAY RECENT CHANGES IN SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN IN THE DIRECTION OF SCOPE AND FLEXIBILITY IT NEED HARDLY BE REPEATED THAT THESE CHANGES ARE CHIEFLY THE RESULT OF EXTERNAL DEMANDS AND OF THE CONVICTIONS OF THE TEACHERS WHO MANAGE THE SCHOOLS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN STIMULATED BY THE MARKED ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE COLLEGES FOR AT THE PRESENT DAY SEVERAL IMPORTANT COLLEGES STILL DECLINE TO REGARD ANY PRECOLLEGI ATE COURSE OF STUDY AS COMPARABLE IN VALUE TO THE TRADITIONAL CLASSICAL COURSE THE PRESENT CHARACTERISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAMMES HAVE THEREFORE DEVELOPED RATHER IN SPITE OF THAN WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE COLLEGES BEARING IN MIND THE GREAT INFLUENCE OF COLLEGIATE PREFERENCES ON PRECOLLEGIATE COURSES OF STUDY IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS SHOW CLEARLY THAT WHATEVER ELSE THE SECONDARY SCHOOL MAY ATTEMPT IT MUST AFFORD EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL PUPILS TO GET THE ELEMENTS OF GENERAL CULTURE WHETHER THE PUPILS SUBSEQUENTLY GO TO COLLEGE OR NOT AND THAT ON THIS POINT THE TEACHERS AND THE COMMUNITY ARE IN SUBSTANTIAL AGREEMENT WHAT EVER THE ATTITUDE OF THE COLLEGES MAY BE BUT WHAT IS GENERAL CULTURE THIS QUESTION I SHALL ANSWER BY AND BY THERE IS STILL SOMETHING THAT I WISH TO SAY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RECENT CHANGES IN SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAMMES CONSIDERED AS THE RESULT OF REASONABLE PUBLIC DEMANDS 39AIM OF THE MODERN SECONDARY SCHOOL THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL AND THE FINAL ACCEPTANCE AND CHEERFUL SUPPORT OF IT AS A FIXED AND INDIS PENSABLE PORTION OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS DATE ONLY FROM THE RECENT PAST ANTIHIGHSCHOOL WAVES NO LONGER TRAVERSE THE COUNTRY SINCE THE HIGH SCHOOL HAS CEASED TO SERVE ONLY A LIMITED PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY BY A TOO CLOSE ADHERENCE TO THE CLASSICAL COURSE OF STUDY THE PREFERRED COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSE AND SINCE IT HAS AIMED TO ADAPT ITSELF MORE AND MORE THROUGH THE SCOPE AND FLEXIBILITY OF ITS PROGRAMMES TO THE GROWING DEMANDS OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY SO FAR AS THE DIFFER ING OPPORTUNITIES AND CAPACITIES OF THE CHILDREN PERMIT TOGETHER WITH THIS IMPROVED ADAPTATION OF THE SCHOOL TO THE NEEDS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL THERE IS ALSO A GROWING RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANT SOCIAL AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION WHICH THE SCHOOL HAS TO FULFILL THIS IS AS IT SHOULD BE THE VERY LIFE OF ANY INSTITUTION OF MODERN SOCIETY DEPENDS ON ITS EFFICACY IN PROMOTING PUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIVATE ENDS IT HAS BEEN JUSTLY SAID THAT ALL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS MUST DIE WHICH DO NOT DIRECTLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY PROMOTE EITHER THE SPIRITUAL OR MATERIAL INTERESTS OF MEN NOW THE MATERIAL AND THE SPIR ITUAL INTERESTS OF MEN CHANGE WITH ADVANCING CIVILIZATION HENCE THE PRIMARY SOCIAL FUNCTION OF ALL EDUCATION AND IN PARTICULAR OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IS TO ADAPT EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO THE CIV ILIZATION OF HIS TIME IT IS NO WONDER THAT CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT SHOULD EMPHASIZE THIS FUNCTION OF MODERN EDUCATION THE ONLY WONDER IS THAT WE HAVE NOT EMPHASIZED IT LONG AGO HOW MODERN ELEMENTARY OR PRESECONDARY SCHOOL EDUCA TION AT PRESENT BEGINS THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS FUNCTION WAS BRIEFLY SET FORTH ABOVE IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT DURING THE STAGE OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION THE CHILD WAS TO BE MADE RESPON SIVE TO THE VARIED INTERESTS OFLIFE WAS TO HAVE THE OPPOR TUNITY TO EXERCISE ALL HIS POWERS AND WAS TO DEVELOP HABITS OF THOUGHT AND CONDUCT IN HARMONY WITH HIS GROWING INSIGHT AS A TEMPORARILY DEPENDENT MEMBER OF SOCIETY ON THIS BASIS SECONDARY EDUCATION IS TO BEGIN THE TIME FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION TO BEGIN IS NOT ARBITRARILY 391THE SCHOOL REVIEW CHOSEN THE YEARS COVERED BY IT SAY FROM THE PUPILS THIRTEENTH TO HIS NINETEENTH OR TWENTIENTH YEAR MARK THE TRANSITION FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD INTO LATER CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH THE PERIOD DUR ING WHICH THE CHILD SHOULD PUT AWAY CHILDISH THINGS AND LEARN TO APPRECIATE THE INTERESTS AND THE PURPOSES OF MEN LEARN TO FIND HIS PLACE IN THE SOCIAL WHOLE AND TO REALIZE THE INTERDEPEN DENCE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INTERESTS IT IS THE PERIOD WHEN LIFE AIMS AND LIFE HABITS EMERGE DISTINCTLY AND WHEN THEY SO FAR AS THEY ARE AMENABLE TO EDUCATION MAY THEREFORE BE PERMANENTLY INFLUENCED THESE LIFE AIMS AND LIFE HABITS DEPEND PRIMARILY ON THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUPILS DOMINANT INTERESTS AND POWERS FOR AN INDIVIDUALS DOMINANT INTERESTS AND POWERS WHOLLY DETERMINE THE KIND OF WORK HE VOLUNTARILY ENGAGES IN AND ALSO THE SOURCES OF HIS PLEASURES AND THUS ULTIMATELY WHOLLY DETERMINE HIS PRODUCTIVENESS AND THE CHARAC TER OF HIS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE TO CARRY FORWARD THE WORK OF DEVELOPMENT ALREADY BEGUN IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND AT THE SAME TIME TO DISCHARGE ITS DUTY TO SOCIETY AS WELL AS TO THE INDIVIDUAL IT IS THEREFORE CLEAR THAT SECONDARY EDUCATION SHOULD ESPECIALLY PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EACH PUPILS DOMINANT INTERESTS AND POWERS AND FURTHER THAT IT SHOULD SEEK TO RENDER THESE INTERESTS AND POWERS SUBSERVIENT TO LIFES SERIOUS PURPOSES AND ALSO TO THE POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATION IN THE REFINED PLEASURES OF LIFE THE SERIOUS PURPOSES OF LIFE ARE FIRST SELFSUPPORT OR WHEN THAT IS UNNECESSARY SOME WORTHY FORM OF SERVICE SECOND INTELLIGENT ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN HUMAN AFFAIRS THE DESIRE TO BE ONE WHO WHILE PERFORMING HIS PRIVATE DUTIES AND ENJOYING WHATEVER LEISURE HE MAY EARN OR DESERVE IS TO WORK WITH HIS FELLOW MEN FOR THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND HAPPINESS OF HIS RACE HIS NATION AND HIS OWN IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY THE REFINED PLEASURES OF LIFE ARE FOUND IN THE ABILITY TO PAR TICIPATE WITH INTELLIGENCE AND APPRECIATION IN THE INTELLECTUAL AND ASTHETIC INTERESTS OF CULTIVATED MEN THESE PLEASURES LIKE MOST OF THE INSPIRATION TO WORTHY LIVING IN THE PURSUIT OF THE SERIOUS PURPOSES OF LIFE ARE BROUGHT WITHIN THE REACH OF MEN THROUGH GENERAL CULTURE 392AIM OF THE AIODERN SECONDARY SCHOOL THIS IS THE MEANING OF THE SCOPE OF THE MODERN SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAMME AND ALSO OF THE GROWING TENDENCY TOWARD FLEXIBLE RATHER THAN MANDATORY PROGRAMMES ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS SO FAR AS THESE PROGRAMMES ARE BASED ON REASONABLE PUBLIC DEMANDSDEMANDS APPROVED BY THOUGHTFUL TEACHERS IT SEEMS TO ME THEREFORE THAT THE INDEPENDENT FUNC TION OF MODERN SECONDARY EDUCATION IS FAIRLY DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT FIRST TO PROMOTE THE PUPILS NORMAL PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT SECOND TO STIMULATE EVERY INDIVIDUAL TO AIM AT INTELLIGENT SELF SUPPORT OR SOME WORTHY FORM OF LIFEWORK WHETHER HE INHERITS AN INCOME OR NOT AND TO GIVE HIM GENERAL PREPARATION FOR SUCH ACTIVITY THIRD TO STIMULATE AND PREPARE EACH PUPIL SO FAR AS HIS AGE AND THE TIME LIMITS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION PERMIT TO PARTICIPATE INTELLIGENTLY AND HELPFULLY IN PROMOTING THE WELFARE OF THE SOCIETY OF WHICH HE IS TO FORM A PART FOURTH TO PREPARE AND TO STIMULATE EACH PUPIL TO CARRY FOR WARD HIS OWN DEVELOPMENT UNINTERRUPTEDLY SO FAR AS HIS CIRCUM STANCES PERMIT THROUGH SELFTEACHING WHETHER HE CONTINUES HIS STUDIES IN SOME HIGHER INSTITUTION AFTER HIS SCHOOL LIFE IS CLOSED OR WHETHER HE ENTERS AT ONCE ON HIS ACTIVE LIFE WORK THIS CONCEPTION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION I NOW INTEND TO DIS CUSS AND JUSTIFY BUT MY TIME IS LIMITED I MUST BEG YOU TO ACCEPT AN OUTLINE OF THE ARGUMENT RATHER THAN THE ARGUMENT ITSELF IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE STATEMENT OF THE FUNCTION OF SEC ONDARY EDUCATION JUST GIVEN COMPRISES THREE CLASSES OF AIMS NAMELY VOCATIONAL AIMS SOCIAL AIMS AND CULTURE AIMS THESE THREE AIMS ARE OF COURSE NOT SEPARABLE IN PRACTICE ALTHOUGH THEY CAN BE RARELY IF EVER EQUALLY INFLUENTIAL IN DETERMINING ANY PARTICULAR PHASE OF SCHOOL WORK MOREOVER AS I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO SHOW FARTHER ON THE ATTEMPT TO SEPARATE THEM IN PRACTICE WOULD GREATLY IMPAIR THEIR EFFICACY AND IN PARTICULAR THE ONLY WAY TO REALIZE THE CULTURE AIMS FOR MANY PUPILS WILL BE THE CLOSE AFFILIATION WHICH THE PUPILS MUST BE LED TO SEE BETWEEN THESE AND 393THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE VOCATIONAL AND SOCIAL OR CIVIC AIMS THESE THREE AIMS THEN OUGHT TOGETHER TO PERMEATE AND UNDERLIE ALL THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SCHOOL WE MAY HOWEVER DISCUSS THEM SEPARATELY TO ASSERT THAT SECONDARY EDUCATION SHOULD MINISTER TO VOCA TIONAL AIMS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SECONDARY SCHOOL SHOULD TEACH A TRADE OR A PROFESSION IT MEANS PRIMARILY THAT THE SCHOOL SHOULD ACQUAINT THE PUPIL WITH THE MEANING AND THE IMPOR TANCE OF A VOCATION BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT THE SCHOOL SHOULD GIVE THE PUPIL SUCH GENERAL PREPARATION FOR THE LIFE PURSUIT FOR WHICH HIS TASTES AND APTITUDES ESPECIALLY QUALIFY HIM THAT WHEN HE LEAVES THE SECONDARY SCHOOL HE MAY ENTER ON THE PREPARATION FOR HIS CHOSEN PURSUIT OR THAT PURSUIT ITSELF WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF ITS SCOPE AND MEANING SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES ON WHICH SUCCESS IN IT DEPENDS AND SOME POWER OVER ITS FUNDAMENTAL FACTS AND PROCESSES SUCH PREPARATION THE SECONDARY SCHOOL MAY BE EXPECTED TO GIVE BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE INSPIRING EXAMPLE OF CULTIVATED TEACHERS DEVOTED TO THEIR VOCA TION TEACHERS WHO CONSCIOUSLY BUT JUDICIOUSLY CULTIVATE SYM PATHETIC RELATIONS WITH THEIR PUPILS AND LOSE NO OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH UNOBTRUSIVELY AND WITHOUT PREACHING THE BEARING OF ALL EDUCATION ON A LIFE OF USEFULNESS SUCH TEACHING WE HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT OF THE SECONDARYSCHOOL TEACHER WHO CAN DOUBT THAT IT WOULD HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON THE DEVELOP MENT OF A PERMANENT BENT ON THE PART OF ALL TEACHABLE PUPILS TOWARD AN ACTIVE LIFE TOWARD AN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME WHEN THEY TOO HAVING MADE THE BEST POSSIBLE USE OF THEIR PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT LAY HOLD ON LIFES LARGER DUTIES AND BECOME INDEPENDENT WORKERS IN THE WORLD  BUT WE ALSO EXPECT THE SECONDARY SCHOOL TO MINISTER DIRECTLY TO VOCATIONAL AIMS THROUGH ITS COURSE OF STUDY VOCATIONS SPEAKING BROADLY ARE MECHANICAL OR INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL THE VOCATIONAL AIMS OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR INTELLECTUAL PURSUITSFOR THE PROFESSIONSHAVE LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED AND JUSTIFIED AND NEED NOT DETAIN US IT SHOULD BE SAID HOWEVER THAT SECONDARY EDUCATION HAS NOT BEEN SO ADMIN 394IAM OF THE MODERN SECONDARY SCHOOL ISTERED IN THE PAST THAT THIS FUNCTION HAS BEEN ADEQUATELY DIS CHARGED ALTHOUGH RECOGNIZED A FEW MOMENTS AGO I REMINDED YOU THAT SINCE AN INDIVIDUALS GREATEST CAPACITY FOR SERVICE AND FOR HAPPINESS DEPENDS ON THE DISCOVERY AND CULTIVATION OF HIS PERMANENT INTERESTS AND REAL ABILITIES THE PUPILS GRADUAL SELF REVELATION IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION THIS SELFREVELATION AND THE CORRESPONDING DEVELOP MENT BASED ON IT HAVE OFTEN BEEN THWARTED OR AT LEAST OBSCURED AND DELAYED IF NOT ENTIRELY THWARTED BY THE NARROW AND RIGID PROGRAMMES OF THE PAST WITH THE ADVENT OF AN ENLARGED SCOPE AND THE FLEXIBILITY NOW HAPPILY BECOMING GENERAL IN SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAMMES WE MAY CONFIDENTLY HOPE FOR STEADY IMPROVE MENT IN THIS REGARD IN THE FUTURE WE MUST ADMIT HOWEVER THAT THE VOCATIONAL AIMS OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL AS REGARDS PREPARATION FOR PROFESSIONAL PURSUITS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AND JUSTIFIED WHATEVER SHORTCOMINGS IN ACHIEVEMENT THERE MAY BE WHAT WE DO NOT YET FULLY RECOGNIZE HOWEVER IS THE FUNCTION OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL AS REGARDS THE VOCATIONAL AIMS OF THOSE WHO SUBSEQUENTLY DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO INDUSTRIAL AND COMMER CIAL PURSUITS THIS FUNCTION DESERVES RECOGNITION ON THE BROAD EST GROUNDS BOTH FOR THE SAKE OF THE VOCATIONAL INTERESTS THEM SELVES AND FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THE POSSIBLE INTERESTS WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL OR SOCIETY HAS THIS MEANS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PURELY INTELLECTUAL COURSES OF THE SCHOOL WE SHOULD MAINTAIN IN EVERY SECONDARY SCHOOL WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COURSES IN MANUAL TRAINING AND COM MERCIAL COURSES WHICH TOGETHER WITH THEIR GENERAL EDUCATIONAL AIMS MINISTER DIRECTLY TO VOCATIONAL AND SOCIAL AIMS I AM AWARE THAT THE ARGUMENT FOR COURSES IN MANUAL TRAIN ING IS NOT A NEW ONE BUT WHO WILL ASSERT THAT WE HAVE HEEDED IT AS IT DESERVES TO BE HEEDED AGAIN I DESIRE TO INSIST ON THE INDISPENSABLE VALUE OF SUCH COURSES IN ALL SECONDARY EDUCA TION AND NOT ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ISOLATED MANUAL TRAINING OR COMMERCIAL HIGH SCHOOLS ALTHOUGH I AM READY TO ADMIT THE PRES ENT VALUE OF SUCH SEPARATE SCHOOLS AS IMPORTANT TRANSITIONAL STAGES IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE SCHEME OF SECONDARY EDU 395THE SCHOOL REVIEW CATION TOWARD WHICH I BELIEVE WE ARE TENDING AND WHICH SEEMS TO ME BOTH INEVITABLE AND DESIRABLE MOREOVER IN THE EXISTING MANUAL TRAINING CLASSES AND MANUAL TRAINING OR MECHANIC ARTS HIGH SCHOOLS PEDAGOGICAL RATHER THAN VOCATIONAL AND SOCIAL ENDS HAVE RECEIVED MOST ATTENTION AND THE GREATEST EMPHASIS THIS IS ATTESTED BY THE PREVALENT TONE OF MOST OF THE DISCUSSION OF MANUAL TRAINING AND ALSO BY THE FACT THAT MANUAL TRAINING CLASSES AND SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ATTENDED HITHERTO FAR MORE NUMER OUSLY BY THE CHILDREN OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL CLASSES THAN BY THE CHILDREN OF ARTISANS I AM FAR FROM INDIFFERENT TO THE GENERAL EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF APPROPRIATE MANUAL TRAINING FOR ALL CLASSES OF CHILDREN OF BOTH SEXES AS WILL BE APPARENT FARTHER ON BUT MY PRESENT PURPOSE IS TO INSIST ON THE NECESSITY OF MANUAL TRAINING AND COMMERCIAL COURSES IN ALL SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR VOCATIONAL AND SOCIAL ENDS AND FOR THE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMER CIAL CLASSES IN PARTICULAR I BEG YOU TO BEAR WITH ME THEREFORE WHILE I BRIEFLY REMIND YOU OF TWO OR THREE OF THE ARGUMENTS MOST IMPORTANT FOR MY PRESENT PURPOSE FIRST AS TO MANUAL TRAINING THE ESSENTIAL POINT TO BE KEPT IN MIND IN THE DISCUSSION OF MANUAL TRAINING FOR VOCATIONAL ENDS IN EDUCATION IS THIS THAT OURS IS THE EPOCH OF INDUSTRIAL INSTA BILITY AND INDUSTRIAL SPECIALIZATION BY REASON OF WHICH THE WORKING BOY OF TODAY NEEDS NOT SO MUCH ANY ONE TRADE AS THAT COMBINATION OF QUALITIES WHICH WILL ENABLE HIM TO TURN WITH FACILITY FROM ONE OCCUPATION TO ANOTHER AS EACH IN TURN IS SUP PLANTED IN THE COURSE OF THE INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTION SUCH TRAIN ING IS OF COURSE VERY DIFFERENT FROM TRAINING FOR A SINGLE TRADE THE POLICY OF TRAINING BOYS FOR ONE NARROW TRADE CANNOT PER MANENTLY COMMEND ITSELF TO MEN AND WOMEN IN AN EPOCH OF INDUSTRIAL CHANGE AND OF HIGHLY SPECIALIZED MECHANICAL SKILL ON THE CONTRARY THE MORE SPECIALIZED THE PROCESSES OF COM MERCE AND MANUFACTURE BECOME THE MORE MUST WE INSIST ON THE EDUCATION OF ALL THE POWERS OF ALL THE WORKERS THE MORE STUPE FYINGLY MONOTONOUS THE MANIPULATION WHICH THE MACHINE PRE  THE WORKING BOY BY FLORENCE KELLEY AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY II 158 396AIM OF THE MODERN SECONDARY SCHOOL

MERELY PRESSING A BUTTON THAT THE COMPOSITOR WILL BE SUPPLANTED BY THE LINOTYPE AND THE TAILOR BY THE LITTLE GIRL AT THE MACHINE THE MORE MUST THE SCHOOL DO FOR ALL THREE THAT WHICH THEIR OCCUPATIONS CAN NO LONGER DO FOR THEM NAMELY TEACH THEM TO THINK AND LIVE AND USE ALL THEIR FACULTIES THE MORE PRECARIOUS THE POSITION OF THE SKILLED MAN THE MORE MUST WE DEMAND OF THE SCHOOLS VERSATILITY

EDUCATION AT THE COST OF THE COMMUNITY EXTENDING OVER SEVERAL YEARS FOR ONE SET OF CHILDREN WHILE FOR ANOTHER AND MUCH LARGER SET THERE ARE AT MOST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF INSTRUCTION OF MEAGER READING WRITING AND ARITHMETIC FOL LOWED BY ENTRANCE UPON THE WORK OF LIFE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD WITH NO PREVIOUS PREPARATION FOR IT AND NO UNITY WHATEVER BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND WORK2 NEXT AS TO THE COMMERCIAL COURSES AS VARIED AND COMPLEX AS ARE THE WANTS OF OUR NATIONAL LIFE SO VARIED AND COMPLEX ARE THE NEEDS OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM  IF WE SHOULD FIND THAT THERE IS AN EDUCATIONAL NEED AND NO CORRESPONDING EDUCAR TIONAL INSTITUTION IT BECOMES OUR DUTY AS PUBLIC SPIRITED CITIZENS TO DO OUR BEST TO SECURE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH INSTITU TIONS  1  THE WORKING BOY BY FLORENCE KELLEY AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY II 158 IBID 397THE SCHOOL RE VIEW NOTHING IS MORE OBVIOUS AND REMARKABLE IN THE DEVELOP MENT OF MODERN SOCIAL LIFE THAN THE EVERINCREASING IMPORTANCE OF THE BUSINESS CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY EVEN IN EUROPE WHERE THE NOBILITY THE ARMY THE CIVIL SERVICE THE LEARNED PRO FESSIONS STILL OCCUPY THE LEADING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL POSITIONS THE SOCIAL STATUS OF THE BUSINESS CLASSES IS CONTINUALLY CHANGING FOR THE BETTER THE BUSINESS CLASSES THEMSELVES ARE ACQUIRING A CONTINUALLY INCREASING INFLUENCE IN POLITICS AND SOCIETY IN OUR OWN COUNTRY WHERE BUSINESS WAS FROM THE BEGINNING THE OCCU PATION OF THE LEADING PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY THE BUSINESS CLASSES WERE NEVER BEYOND THE PALE OF SOCIETY AS IN EUROPE BUT EVEN HERE THE RELATIVE POSITION OF BUSINESS MEN IN POLITICS AND SOCIETY IS RAPIDLY CHANGING TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE CLASSES FORMERLY LOOKED UPON AS SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LEADERS THE HEROES TO WHOM OUR CHILDREN LOOK UP WHOSE DEEDS ARE RELATED WITH ADMIRATION ARE TODAY THE GREAT CAPTAINS OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY AS THE GREAT ORATORS PREACHERS AND LAWYERS WERE OF A FORMER PERIOD WHETHER FOR WEAL OR WOE THE DOMINATING TONE OF AMERICAN SOCIETY THE IDEAS OF AMERICAN YOUTH ARE SET TO AN EVERINCREASING EXTENT BY THE GREAT RAILROAD MANAGER THE INSUR ANCE DIRECTOR THE BANKER THE MERCHANT THE MANUFACTURER THE AIM OF COMMERCIAL EDUCATION SUCH AS I DESIRE MAY HE STATED IN A FEW WORDS IT IS TO AWAKEN A PROFOUND INTEREST IN BUSINESS AS SUCH TO TRAIN A YOUTH TO AN APPRECIATION OF THE FUNCTIONS OF BUSINESS AND BUSINESS PRACTICE IN OUR MODERN LIFE TO INFORM HIM AS TO THE HISTORY OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE TO AWAKEN HIS INTEREST IN ITS FUTURE TO TRAIN HIM TO KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AS TO BUSINESS POSSIBILITIES TO INSPIRE HIM WITH A HEALTHY RESPECT FOR BUSINESS IN ALL ITS BRANCHES TO AROUSE A DETERMINATION TO BECOME NOT ONLY A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MAN IN THE ORDINARY SENSE OF THE TERM BUT A USEFUL ONE AS WELL TO BEGET A PUBLIC SPIRIT TO EXCITE AN INTEREST IN THE HIGHER WELFARE OF SOCIETY IN A WORD TO BECOME A PUBLICSPIRITED INTELLIGENT WELL EDUCATED AND SUC CESSFUL MAN OF AFFAIRS 2 PROFESSOR EDMUND J JAMES IN AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE AMERICAN BANKERS ASSO CIATION PUBLISHED BY THE ASSOCIATION 2 IBID 398AIM OF THE MODERN SECONDARY SCHOOL ALTHOUGH WE HAVE COMMERCIAL COURSES IN EXISTING HIGH SCHOOLS AND MANY SOCALLED COMMERCIAL COLLEGES IT CAN HARDLY BE CLAIMED THAT THE AIMS AND WORK OF THESE COURSES AND COMMERCIAL COLLEGES MEET THE DEMAND JUST QUOTED SECONDARYSCHOOL COURSES WITH SUCH AIMS SEEM TO ME AS IMPORTANT AS THE MANUAL TRAINING COURSES AND FOR LIKE REASONSI E PRIMARILY FOR VOCATIONAL AND SOCIAL EDUCATION BUT ALSO IN AN IMPORTANT SENSE FOR THE GENERAL EDUCA TION THE GENERAL CULTURE WHICH MAY BE BASED ON THEM OR NATURALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND WHICH WITHOUT THEM IS TOO OFTEN MISSED ALTOGETHER BY MOST CHILDREN AND YOUTH OF THE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL CLASSES UNLESS THE PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOL WHICH THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BY TAXATION OR THE PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOL WHICH INVITES THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY RESPONDS TO THE TWO FUN DAMENTAL NEEDS OF OUR YOUTH WHICH HAVE JUST BEEN CONSIDERED PUPILS TOO OFTEN PASS AT ONCE FROM THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TO THEIR LIFE WORK OR IF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES PERMIT THEY MAY SO FAR AS PREPARATION FOR BUSINESS IS CONCERNED SEEK IT AT PRESENT IN SOME INFERIOR INSTITUTION LIKE THE COMMERCIAL COLLEGES IN EITHER CASE THE RESULT IS LIKELY TO BE ATTENDED BY WIDESPREAD IGNORANCE AMONG THE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL CLASSES WHICH MAKES THEM THE PREY OF THE DEMAGOGUE AND THE SOCIAL AGITATOR AND BY THE ACCOMPANYING DISHEARTONING INDIFFERENCE TO ALL INTERESTS EXCEPT THE NARROWLY USEFUL IMPORTANT AS THESE ARE A CHILD WHO ON LEAVING THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THENCEFORWARD DEVOTES HIMSELF TO A TRADE OR TO BUSINESS IS ALMOST SURE TO HAVE HIS INTERESTS LIMITED BY HIS OCCUPATION WHETHER WITH OR AGAINST HIS ORIGINAL INCLINATION TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT HIS SUCCESS IS MADE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF HIS IGNORANCE AND INAD EQUATE PREPARATION IF HOWEVER ALL OBSTACLES TO SUCCESS ARE ULTIMATELY OVERCOME BY HIS UNUSUAL INDUSTRY AND NATURAL CAPACITY IN THE END THE SUCCESSFUL BUT UNENLIGHTENED MERCHANT OR ARTISAN IS ALMOST SURE TO SWELL THE RANKS OF THE PHILISTINES FOR HE HAS MISSED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE EXTRAVOCATIONAL INTERESTS WHICH PERSONS OF SOME DEGREE OF CULTIVATION POSSESS IN COMMON AND WHICH SERVE TO ENRICH AND SWEETEN LIFE 399THE SCHOOL REVIE W I HAVE URGED THE SPECIAL IMPORTANCE OF COURSES IN MANUAL TRAINING AND COMMERCIAL COURSES FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL CLASSES BUT SUCH COURSES ARE NEEDED NOT MERELY TO SATISFY THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF THESE CLASSES MANY A YOUTH FROM THE PROFESSIONAL CLASSES WOULD BE MUCH MORE USEFUL AND HAPPY MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL AND A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT MEMBER OF SOCIETY IN AFTER LIFE IF INSTEAD OF ATTEMPTING TO PUR SUE A PROFESSION WHICH HE HAS DRIFTED INTO OR WHICH HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY CHOSEN FOR HIM HE HAD CULTIVATED HIS MECHANICAL OR BUSINESS TASTES AND CAPACITIES AND HAD LEARNED THROUGH COURSES IN MANUAL TRAINING AND COMMERCIAL COURSES WHILE STILL A YOUTH TO SELECT THE CALLING FOR WHICH HE IS BEST FITTED BY NATURE BY FAILING TO PROVIDE SUCH COURSES FOR SUCH A PUPIL WE HAVE PRE VENTED HIM FROM DEVELOPING THE POWERS WHICH HE HAS WE HAVE DWARFED HIS GENERAL CULTURE BY REQUIRING HIM TO FOLLOW A COURSE OF INSTRUCTION TO WHICH HE WAS NOT ADAPTED AND THIS HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY A PROFESSIONAL TRAINING THROUGH WHICH HE COULD ONLY HOPE TO ESCAPE FAILURE OR AT BEST TO ATTAIN MEDI OCRITY AND ALL THIS IS A SINFUL PERVERSION OF OPPORTUNITY THESE COURSES ARE ACCORDINGLY NEEDED AS WELL AS THE PURELY INTELLECTUAL COURSES FOR THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOMINANT INTERESTS AND CAPACITIES OF ALL CHILDREN BY PLACING SUCH COURSES SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE INTELLECTUAL COURSE BY MAKING THEM SOLID AND LIBERALIZING WE ATTACH DUE WEIGHT TO THEIR SCOPE AND MEANING WE PUT THE STAMP OF GENERAL APPROVAL ON THEM WE DIGNIFY THEM WE MAKE THEM WORTH CHOOSING NO MATTER FROM WHAT CLASS OF SOCIETY THE PUPIL MAY COME BY SO DOING THE SCHOOL MAY MINISTER DIRECTLY AND WISELY TO VOCATIONAL AIMS SO MUCH FOR VOCATIONAL AIMS WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE COURSES WHICH MINISTER TO THEM ALSO MINISTER INCIDENTALLY AND IN AN IMPORTANT SENSE TO SOCIAL AIMS BUT THE SOCIAL AIMS THEMSELVES ARE TOO IMPORTANT FOR ALL CLASSES OF PUPILS TO PERMIT US TO BE SATISFIED WITH THIS THESE SOCIAL AIMS MUST THEMSELVES RECEIVE SPECIAL RECOGNITION IHARVARD UNIVERSITY PAUL H HANUS CONTINUED IN SEPTEMBER 400

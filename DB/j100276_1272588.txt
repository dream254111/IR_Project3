j100276,Michigan Law Review,1272588,Bankruptcy Mechanics Lien Setoff,i254452,MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW control Held I that such provision applied only in case of the bankrupts death 2 that if applied to a wifes inchoate right of dower the provision would be unconstitutional and 3 that the principle of allowing the lex situs to control the admeasurement of dower was not a violation of the con stitutional provision requiring Bankruptcy Acts to be uniform throughout the United States Thomias v Woods et al I909  C C A 8th Cir  173 Fed 585 The first holding seems reasonably clear from the language of the section but the constitutional question suggested is more difficult It has long been held that the constitutional requirement that Bankruptcy Acts shall be uniform does not affect the admeasurement of dower Darling v Berry 13 Fed 659 nor the bankrupts exemptions where Congress has not legislated upon the subject Hanover National Bank v Moyses i86 U S I8I 22 Sup Ct 857 46 L Ed 1113 And it is equally well settled that the right to dower is determined by the lex situs Jennings v Jennings 21 Oh St 56 Atkinson v Staigg 13 R I 725 The power of Congress to make a different rule apply is exceedingly doubtful A wifes right to dower even though inchoate is none the less her property and forms no part of the bankrupts estate The right to control its admeasurement seems therefore not a necessary part of a Bankruptcy Act and hence not within the power of Congress BANKRUPTCYMECHANICS LIENSETOFFA building contractbr had contracted to put up a building upon certain realty but became bankrupt before the building was paid for by the owner After the contractor had been adjudged a bankrupt the owner paid certain subcontractors the amount of their claims against the principal contractor in order to discharge a mechanics lien against the property created by the statutes of Pennsylvania In a suit by the bankrupts trustee against the owner for the contract price of the building the defendant sought to have these claims set off against the plaintiffs demand under Bankruptcy Act July i 1898 c 541  68 30 Stat 565 U S Comp St I901 p 3450 which provides that a In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of the bankrupt and a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set off against the other and the balance only shall be allowed and paid b A setoff or counterclaim shall not be allowed in favor of any debtor of the bankrupt which is not provable against the estate    On behalf of the trustee it was contended that the defendants expenditures in discharging the liens were not provable at the time of filing the petition because the defendants liability to such subcontractors was merely contingent and could not have been proved against the estate of the bankrupt when he made the payments Held that the payments could be set off against the amount due on the contract Wagner v Burnhamt I909  Pa  73 Atl ggo The right of a surety to set off payments made upon his principals debt is well recognized In re Dillon Ioo Fed 627 In the principal case it is observed that the defendant is in effect a statutory surety and therefore his right to set off ought to be the same Whether such a debt is provable within the meaning of  68 supra is more difficult In Morgan v Wordell I7 412RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS Mass 350 59 N E Io37 55 L R A 33 it was held that a claim could be set off if provable at the time it was attempted to be set off though not strictly so at the time of filing the petition the court holding that provable meant 4provable in nature This view was approved in Norfolk  W Ry v Graham 145 Fed 809 76 C C A 385 I6 Am B R 6Io and derives con siderable support from the fact that provable in nature was the language used in the Act of 1867 There seems to be no good reason why one discharg ing a mechanics lien which may subsequently be enforced against him should not be held to possess the same equities as a surety discharging the obliga tion of his principal debtor The one claim appears no more contingent than the other BILLS AND NOTESUSURYWHEN NOTE IS VOID AS TO BOTH PRINCIPAL AND INTERESTPlaintiff brings suit to recover the amount of a promissory note The note represented a loan of 225 made by the plaintiff to the maker and 25 interest charged thereon for the use of the 225 for eight months and ten days The maker to secure the indorsement of his codefefdants who were merchants trading under a firm name made the instrument payable to the firm and it was indorsed as such to plaintiff Held HAYES J dissent ing that under Ind Ter St I899  3043 Mansf Dig  4732 the note was void as to both principal and interest and there could be no recovery on the same Sulphur Bank  Trust Co v Medlock et al I9o9  Okl  105 Pac 321 This decision is interesting in showing the courts literal construction of the usury statute The case however would be much more interesting if in the unofficial report the dissenting opinion of Judge HAYES had been given The courts are not in harmony in construing usury statutes The conflict between the state courts is due in a great measure to the wording of the various state statutes Where a part of a contract is tainted with usury the whole contract is illegal Ormund v Hobart 36 Minn 306 31 N W 213 Brown v Nevitt 27 Miss 8oi A usurious contract is not absolutely void but voidable only to the extent of the interest Masterson v Grubbs 70 Ala 406 Dawson v Burrus 73 Ala III Usury avoids a contract only as to the excess above legal interest Farmers  Traders Bank v Harrison 57 Mo 503 The statute in the principal case expressly declared all contracts for greater rate of interest than Io per cent per annum shall be void as to principal and interest In Claflin v Boorum 122 N Y 385 Judge VANN says a note void in its inception for usury continues void forever whatever its subsequent history may be The principal case was correctly decided and from the express terms of the statute is amply sustained by reason and authority See Claflin v Boorum supra Schlessinger v Lehmaier I9I N Y 69 BOUNDARIESMEANDER LINERIPARIAN

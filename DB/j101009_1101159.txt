J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1101159,THE TORRENS SYSTEM AN OPEN SYMPOSIUM HON EUGENE C MASSIES REPLY TO HON E P COX AND HON A A PHLEGAR,I245939,1905 THE TORRENS SYSTEM 649 THE TORRENS SYSTEM AN OPEN SYMPOSIUM HON EUGENE C MASSIES REPLY TO HON E P COX AND HON A A PHLEGAR THE LAW REGISTER IS PERFORMING A GREAT PUBLIC SERVICE BY OPEN ING ITS COLUMNS FOR THE DISCUSSION OF OUR LAND LAWS THE WRITER REJOICES THAT THE PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA HAVE BEEN AWAKENED TO THE NEED FOR REFORM AND HE FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THE BAR WILL ASSUME ITS PROPER PLACE OF LEADERSHIP IN A MOVEMENT DESTINED TO SWEEP THE STATE AND CLEAR OUR JURISPRUDENCE FROM THE COBWEBS OF AN EF FETE SYSTEM THIS OPEN SYMPOSIUM IS THEREFORE MOST WELCOME SINCE FROM WHATEVER POINT OF VIEW IT MAY BE REGARDED IT MUST LEAD TO BENEFICIAL RESULTS BUT IN THE BEGINNING LET THESE FACTS BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD FIRST IT IS NOT CLAIMED THAT THE TORRENS SYSTEM OF LAND REGISTRATION IS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION THAT WERE TO RAISE IT FROM THE REALM OF THE HUMAN TO THAT OF THE DIVINE SECOND NOR IS IT CLAIMED THAT THE PROPOSED TORRENS BILL IS PERFECT THAT WERE TO ASSUME A POSITION OF RIDICULOUS ARROGANCE THE EXISTENCE OF AND NECESSITY FOR HUMAN LAWS IMPLIES A SAD STATE OF HUMAN IMPERFECTION HOWEVER MUCH WE MAY EMULATE THE VISION OF THAT EMINENT DIVINE RICHARD HOOKER WHOSE CONCEPT WAS OF THE LAW WHOSE SEAT IS THE BOSOM OF GOD HER VOICE THE HAR MONY OF THE WORLD THE HIGHEST EFFORT OF LEGISLATION IS TO PRODUCE WHAT MY LORD COKE TERMS THE LAW WHICH IS PERFECTION OF REASON RESPONDING TO THIS TEST WE ARE READY TO SUBMIT THE TORRENS SYSTEM TO THE CALM JUDGMENT OF THE VIRGINIA BENCH AND BAR AND WE ASK WHETHER IT IS MORE REASONABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH MERE EVIDENCES OF TITLE IN ALL LAND TRANSACTIONS OR TO DEAL IN EVERY TRAASACTION WITH THE TITLE ITSELF  AS IS DONE BY THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE IN ALL THE VAST TRANSACTIONS WITH PERSONAL PROPERTY WE ASK WHETHER IT IS MORE REASONABLE TO CLING TO THE LETTER OR THE SPIRIT OF LAWS MADE CENTURIES AGO AND FORCED UPON OUR ANCESTORS BY A FOREIGN CONQUEROR OR TO OPEN OUR EYES TO THE PROGRESS OF THE HUMAN RACE AND PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE WHO SPEAK OUR TONGUE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTICLEAV ING OUT IF YOU PLEASE THE ENLIGHTENED NATIONS OF A DIFFERENT RACE650 11 VIRGINFA LAW REGISTER DEC WHO MIGHT ALSO TEACH US THE USES OF REGISTRATION THE EXACT PROPO SITIONS ARE FIRST THAT THE TORRENS SYSTEM OF LAND REGISTRATION REG ISTERING AT EVERY TURN THE TITLE ITSELF IS AN IMPROVEMENT UPON THE RECORD SYSTEM PREVAILING IN VIRGINIA UNDER WHICH MERE EVIDENCES OF TITLE ARE PERMITTED TO BE RECORDED AND NO PROVISION WVHATEVER IS MADE FOR THE COMPLETE RECORD OF ALL SUCH EVIDENCES SECOND THAT THE PROPOSED BILL IS EITHER GOOD ENOUGH TO BEGIN WITH OR CAN BE MADE SO BY PROPER AMENDMENTS IT IS CONCEDED THAT VIRGINIA OUGHT TO HAVE NONE BUT THE BEST AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT HER BENCH AND BAR SHALL DO THEIR FULL DUTY IN THIS BEHALF TT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN ONE ARTICLE TO ATTEMPT TO ANSWER ALL THE OB JECTIONS SUGGESTED IN THE NOVEMBER NUTMBER OF THE REGISTER AND AS MY BROTHER COX AND MY BROTHER PHLEGAR WILL BOTH HAVE VOTES IN THE NEXT GENERAL ASSEMBLY MY FIRST ENDEAVOR WILL BE TO ALLAY THEIR FEARS AND SATISFY THEIR CONSCIEINCES CONCERNING THE EFFECT OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION REPLY TO HON EDWIN P COX MR COX SEEMS TO PIN HIS FAITH TO MIR WILLIAM C NIBLACK OF THE CHICAGO BAR WHO HAS WRITTEN A TREATISE ENTITLED THE TORRENS SYS TEM ITS COST AND COMPLEXITY MR NIBLACK FRANKLY CONFESSES IN HIS PREFACE THAT FOR TWELVE YEARS HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE STOCK HOLDERS OFFICERS AND ATTORNEYS OF THE CHICAGO TITLE AND TRUST COMPANY THIS CORPORATION HAD AN INCOME OF 49695258 FROM THE EXAMINATIONS OF TITLE ALONE IN 1903 WHEN MR NIBLACKS BOOK WAS WRITTEN TO SAY NOTHING OF WHAT IT GATHERED IN FROM ITS BUSI NESS OF INSURING TITLES MR NIBLACKADMITS THAT THE INCOME OF HIS COMPANY WOULD BE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE GROWTH OF THE TOR ENS SYSTEM AND THEN ADDS NAIVELY THIS FACT MAY AFFECT MY JUDGMENT AND RENDER ME LESS CAPABLE OF PASSING IMPARTIAL OPINIONS ON THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF THE TORRENS LAWS HAVING THUS ASSTUAGED HIS CONSCIENCE LHE PROCEEDS TO ATTACK THE TORRENS SYSTEM FROM EVERY CONCEIVABLE POINT OF VIEW IN AN ELEGANT ANID HIGHLY EN TERTAINING MANNER I HAVE READ HIS BOOK CAREFULLY AND WHILE I ENJOYED THE ABILITY WITH WHICH HE PRESENTS HIS VIEWS I DO NOT RE CALL A SINGLE ARGUMENT THAT CAINNOT BE ANSWERED OR THAT HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED BY STUDENTS OF THE SUBJECT 1IS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED TO STEM THE TIDE OF POPULAR AND PROFESSIONAL FAVOR WITH WHICH THE1905 THE TORRENS SYSTEM 651 ILLINOIS ACT WAS BEING RECEIVED THE RESULT OF THE EFFORT MAY BE LEARMED FROM THE FACT THAT WHEN AN AMENDMENT REQUIRING EXECU TORS AND ADMINISTRATORS SIC TO REGISTER THE TITLES TO REAL ESTATE UNDER THEIR CONTROL WAS SUBMITTED TO THE PEOPLE IN NOVEMBER 1904 THE VOTERS OF CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY DECLARED THEMSELVES IN FAVOR OF IT BY A POPULAR MAJORITY OF 211883 THE TOTAL VOTE WAS 241926 AND THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF THE GREAT TITLE COMPANIES AND ALL OPPONENTS OF THE TORRENS SYSTEM ONLY SUCCEEDED IN MUSTER ING 30043 PERSONS AGAINST IT THIS IS A SAMPLE OF THE FAVOR WITH WHICH THE SYSTEM IS REGARDED WHEREVER IT HAS BEEN TRIED MR COX SUGGESTS SEVERAL OBJECTIONS 1 THAT THE TORRENS SYSTEM MAY SUIT OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE CONDITIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM OURS IMPLYING THAT IT WILL NOT SUIT VIRGINIA THIS SUGGESTION IS ANSWERED BY THE HISTORY OF REGIS TRATION IN AUSTRALIA ENGLAND CANADA ILLINOIS MASSACHUSETTS MLINNESOTA AND OTHER COUNTRIES 2 HE OBJECTS THAT THE ACT IS ALONG THE LINE OF STATE SOCIALISM HOW THE STATE IS ASKED TO GIVE NOTHING TO ANY CLASS OR INDI VIDUAL NOR DOES SHE ASSUME ANY LIABILITY OF ANY SORT SHE IT SIMPLY ASKED TO PASS A GENERAL LAW FOR THE ASSURANCE OF TITLES A GENERAL LAW IN PRINCIPLE NOT UNLIKE THAT GOVERNING NEGOTIABLE IN STRUMENTS 3 HE OBJECTS TO 230 ADDITIONAL OFFICIALS THAT SOUNDS AS IF THE STATE WERE ASKED TO FEED A HUNGRY HORDE OR AS IF AN ARMY OF PENSIONERS WERE TO BE BILLETED ON THE PEOPLE IN POINT OF FACT IT MEANS EXAMINERS OF TITLE WHO ARE NOT TO BE PAID ONE CENT BY THE STATE NOR THE HALF OF A CENT BY ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT WISH TO EMPLOY THEM DO WE HEAR OBJECTIONS MADE TO THE NEGOTIA BILITY OF BILLS OF EXCHANGE NOTES AND DRAFTS BECAUSE NOTARIES PUB LIC MUST BE APPOINTED TO NOTE DISHONOR AND PROTEST OR DO WE HEAR COMPLAINTS WHEN AN INCREASE OF BUSINESS REQUIRES AN INCREASE OF NOTARIES  4 HE OBJECTS THAT THE BILL MAKES NO MENTION OF THE TAX ON DEEDS AND ASKS IF IT IS PROPOSED TO ABOLISH THIS TAX OF COURSE NOT SEE SECTIONS 48 AND 50 5 HE OBJECTS THAT THE BILL MAKES NO ADEQUATE PROVISIONS FOR THE LEVYING OF TAXES AND LEVIES AND THE TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP ON THE LAND BOOKS A MERE INSPECTION OF SECTION 48 WILL SHOW THE CONTRARY652 11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC 6 HE OBJECTS THAT THE BILL WILL NOT REDUCE COST OF TRANSFER BUT WILL ACTUALLY IMPOSE AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN THIS IS CON TRADICTED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERY COUNTRY THAT HAS TRIED THE TORRENS SYSTEM ONO OF ITS MAIN OBJECTS IS TO REDUCE COSTS AND THE TESTIMONY IS UNANIMOUS THAT IT DOES REDUCE THEM THE CASE OF VIRGINIA B  L CO V GLENN 99 VA 460 IS NOT IN POINT THE EX PARTE RECORD OF A DEED CANNOT BE COMPARED TO A DECREE OF COURT INTER PARTES AND IN A PROCEEDING IN REM 7 HE OBJECTS THAT NEW LEGISLATION WILL FURNISH ENDLESS CAUSES OF LITIGATION FOLLOWING OUT THAT IDEA A PERPETUAL INJUNCTION SHOULD BE OBTAINED AGAINST THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND EVERY EFFORT TO REVISE LEGISLATION OR IMPROVE BUSINESS METHODS REPLY TO HON A A PHLEGAR I JUDGE PHLEGAR OBJECTS THAT AS THE TORRENS SYSTEM IS IN TENDED TO BE OPTIONAL WE WILL HAVE TWO SYSTEMS FOR THE TRANS FER OF TITLES BUT HE DOES NOT INDICATE THAT HE WOULD BE SATISFIED IF THE TORRENS SYSTEM WERE IMMEDIATELY MADE COMPULSORY OR SHOULD BECOME EXCLUSIVE THIS MAKES IT EVIDENT THAT THE REAL OBJECTION IS NOT TO THE DUAL SYSTEM BUT TO THE FACT THAT THE TORRENS SYS TEM IS TO BE ONE OF THE TWO SYSTEMS THE POINT ABOUT GRAY HORSES AND BAY HORSES IS NOT WELL TAKEN THERE IS NO QUESTION OF TWO METHODS OF SALE FOR REAL ESTATE THE QUESTION IS ONE OF TITLE THE MAN WHO BUYS A GRAY HORSE AND TAKES A BILL OF SALE MAY BE ABLE TO SELL AGAIN MORE READILY THAN THE PURCHASER OF A BAY HORSE WITHOUT A BILL OF SALE BUT OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE DUE TO TITLE AND NOT TO COLOR SO THE MAN WHO BUYS REGISTERED LAND WITH A CERTIFICATE OF TITLE MAY BE ABLE TO SELL AGAIN MORE READILY THAN THE PURCHASER UNDER A DEED WITH WARRANTY OF TITLE BUT AS THE PURCHASER OF A HORSE MAY NOT RE QUIRE A BILL OF SALE SO THE PURCHASER OF LAND MAY NOT REQUIRE A CERTIFICATE OF TITLE WHAT IS THERE ABOUT THE REGISTRATION OF TITLE AND THE RECORD OF DEEDS LOGICALLY TO SUGGEST A LAW FOR THE SALE OF BAY HORSES IN ONE WAY AND GRAY HORSES IN ANOTHER AS THE OWNER MAY ELECT  THE OWNER OF UNREGISTERED LAND COULD NOT AT HIS ELECTION SELL IT AS REGISTERED LAND NOR VICE VERSA AND IF DUAL SYSTEMS OF PROPERTY ARE TO BE CONDEMNED SHOULD WE NOT ABOLISH THE DUAL SYSTEM OF LEGAL AND EQUITABLE TITLES 1905 THE TORRENS SYSTEM 653 II JUDGE PHLEGARS CRITICISM OF THE CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH OF SEETION 12 OF THE BILL IS ANSWERED BY THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THAT SECTION AND BY THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 13 14 15 17 18 19 AND 35 HE SAYS THERE IS NOTHING REQUIRING THE PETITIONER TO MAKE INQUIRY FOR SUCH PERSONS MEANING ALL PERSONS THAT MAY BE INTERESTED IN THE PROCEEDINGS FOR REGISTRATION THE SECTIONS CITED ABOVE PLAINLY IMPOSE UPON THE PETITIONER THE DUTY OF SETTING FORTH ALL ADVERSE CLAIMS AND IF HE FAILS TO GIVE FULL INFORMATION IN THE PETITION THE FACTS WILL BE SUBSEQUENTLY BROUGHT OUT AT HIS EXPENSE IN THE CDURSE OF THIS PROCEEDING THE CRITICISM OF SECTION 14 IS ANSWERED BY SECTION 1105 F 14 OF THE CODE JUDGE PHIEGAR SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF THE LAWYERS IN WHOSE MIND A QUAERE MAY ARISE AS TO JUST WHAT THE PUBLICATION IN OTHER PROCEEDINGS IN REM IS IN VIRGINIA IN ADDITION TO CONDEMNATION CASES IN WHICH AN ORDER OF PUBLICATION IS REQUIRED TO BE MADE WHERE THERE IS NO TENANT OF THE FREEHOLD DOES HE NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT WE ALSO HAVE ESCHEATS TAX SALES ATTACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AND ADMIRALTY CASES IN VIR GINIAALL PROCEEDINGS IN REMIN WHICH NOTICE IS GIVEN BY PUB LICATION OR BY PUBLICATION AND POSTING IN LIEU OF PERSONAL SERVICE OF PROCESS IF THERE IS ANY AMBIGUITY ABOUT SECTION 15 I WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE JUDGE PHLEGARS COOPERATION IN MAKING IT PLAIN THE WORDS EXCEPT AS HEREIN PROVIDED IN SECTION 23 WERE IN TENDED TO REFER TO THE ACT AND NOT TO THE SECTION IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE CRITICISM THAT THERE IS NO SUCH PROVISION WE CAN EASILY SAY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS ACT IN THIS PORTION OF HIS PAPER JUDGE PHLEGAR NEXT COMPLAINS THAT THE PROVISIONS FOR NOTICE OF REGISTRATION ARE NOT SUFFICIENT BUT IN HIS VIJTH INDICTMENT HE COMPLAINS THAT THE PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE BILL FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCOVERING EVERY ADVERSE CLAIMANT AND NOTIFYING EVERY ONE WHO MAY BE INTERESTED IN ANY WAV ARE UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE IF THE ADVOCATES OF THE BILL WERE TO ARGUE IN THAT WAY I FEAR THEY WOULD BE ACCUSED OF BLOWING HOT AND COLD NO EFFORT HAS BEEN SPARED IN THE BILL TO REACH EVERY ONE WHO MAY HAVE ANY SORT OF CLAIM OR INTEREST IN ANY LAND OFFERED FOR REGISTRATION THE 20 STEPS CITED BY JUDGE PHLEGAR IN THE VIITH DIVISION OF HIS PAPER ARE FULL CONFIRMA TION OF THIS STATEMENT I WOULD LIKE FOR EVERY MEMBER OF THE BAR TO STUDY THE BILL IMPARTIALLY AND THEN SAY WHETHER OR NOT ANY654 11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC OWNER OF PROPERTY WILL BE LIKELY TO BE ROBBED BY REGISTRATION WITH OUT NOTICE OR WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD READ THE ABLE OPINION OF CHIEF JUSTICE HOLMES IN TYLER V JUDGES OF THE COURT OF REGISTRATION 175 MASS 71 51 L R A 433 REMEMBERING THAT THE PROVISIONS FOR NOTICE IN THE PROPOSED VIRGINIA BILL ARE MORE AMPLE THAN THOSE OF THE MASSACHUSETTS ACT IF SPACE PERMITTED I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THE PROVISIONS OF THE VIRGINIA STATUES FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS IN VARIOUS CASES BUT AS I CANNOT NOW GO INTO THE DETAILS I MAY HEREAFTER SUABMIT TO THE PROFESSION A TABLE OR SYNOPSIS SHOWING THE SUBSTITUTES FOR PER SONAL SERVICE OF PROCESS IN VIRGINIA UNDER MANY EXISTING STATUTES FOR THE PRESENT I BEG LEAVE TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF ALL THOSE INCLINED TO INSIST UPON PERSONAL SERVICE OF PROCESS BY THE SHERIFF IN ALL CASES TO SECTIONS 2967 2979 3207 3225 AND 3321 OF THE CODE STUDY ALSO SECTIONS 3230 AND 3231 HAVE YOU EVER RE FLECTED UPON THE PROVISION FOR AN ORDER OF PUBLICATION ON AFFIDAVIT OF DILIGENCE USED BY THE PLAINTIFF TO ASCERTAIN IN WHAT COUNTY OR CORPORATION THE DEFENDANT IS WITHOUT EFFECT HAVE YOU EVER REFLECTED UPON THE PROVISION FOR AN ORDLER OF PUBLICATION ON AFFIDAVIT THAT PROCESS DIRECTED TO THE OFFICER OF THE COUNTY OR CORPORATION IN WHICH HE RESIDES OR IS HAS BEEN TWICE DELIVERED TO SUCH OFFICER MORE THAN 10 DAYS BEFORE THE RETURN DAY AND BEEN RETURNED WITHOUT BEING EXECUTED HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT AN ORDER OF PUBLICATION MAY BE MADE IN ANY SUIT IN EQUITY WHERE THE BILL STATES THAT THERE ARE OR MAY BE PERSONS INTERESTED WHOSE NAMES ARE UNKNOWN AND AFFIDAVIT IS MADE THAT SUCH PARTIES ARE UNKNOWN HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT AN ORDER OF PUBLICATION MAY BE MADE IN ANY SUIT IN EQUITY WHERE MORE THAN 30 DEFENDANTS HAVE BEEN SERVED WITH PROCESS AND IT APPEARS BY THE BILL OR OTHER PLEADING OR EXHIBITS FILED THAT SUCH DEFENDANTS REPRESENT LIKE IN TERESTS WITH PARTIES NOT SERVED WITH PROCESS AND WILL YOU PLEASE REFLECT THAT ANY ORDER OF PUBLICATION MAY BE PUBLISHED IN SUCH NEWSPAPER AS THE COURT MAY PRESCRIBE OR AS THE CLERK MAY DIRECT BUT THAT THE COURT OR THE JUDGE THEREOF IN VACATION MAY IN ANY CASE DISPENSE WITH SUCH PUBLICATION IN A NEWSPAPER AND SIMPLY HAVE THE ORDER POSTED AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE COURTHOUSE ESPECIAL ATTENTION IS ALSO DIRECTED TO SECTIONS 23612367 IN CLUSIVE OF THE CODE IN WHICH SOME REMARKABLE PROVISIONS ARE1905 THE TORRENS SYSTEM 655 TO BE FOUND OF WHICH I DARE SAY FEW MEMBERS OF THE PROFESSION HAVE TAKEN NOTE JUDGE PHLEGAR EXPRESSES APPREHENSION THAT PROPERTY MAY BE TAKEN FROM ONE RESIDENT ANLD GIVEN TO ANOTHER UNDER THE TOR RENS BILL WITHOUT AN EFFORT AT PERSONAL SERVICE OF PROCESS HE EVINCES NO SYMPATHY FOR A NONRESIDENT WHO MAY BE TREATED IN THAT WAY BUT DECLARES THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG TO SUBJECT ANY RESIDENT TO SUCH A POSSIBILITY SURELY HIS FEARS CAN BE CALMED IN THIS REGARD FOR THE PROPOSED BILL DOES MAKE AT LEAST AN EFFORT AT PERSONAL SERVICE OF PROCESS AND IN ADDITION TO THIS HE SHOULD TAKE SOME COMFORT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES IN WHICH NO EFFORT IS MADE FOR WHAT HE CONSIDERS PERSONAL SER VICE OF PROCESS THE TORRENS ACTS USUALLY PROVIDE FOR AN AS SURANCE FUND OUT OF WHICH COMPENSATION MAY BE MADE TO ANY OR4E WHO HAD NO ACTUAL NOTICE OF ANY REGISTRATION AND THE STA TISTICS SHOW VERY FEW AND VERY SMALL CLAIMS FOR THIS OR ANY OTHER CAUSE AGAINST THE ASSURANCE FURID AFTER 38 YEARS EXPERIENCE HON J 0 BOURNE REGISTRAR OF TITLES AT BRISBANE QUEENSLAND WROTE ME IN 1900 THE TRANSACTIONS SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE NUMBER 1397910 AND THERE HAS BEEN ONLY ONE INSTANCE OF LOSS THROUGH AN INCORRECT TITLE HAVING BEEN ISSUED ONE ERROR IN MORE THAN ONE AND ONETHIRD MILLIONS OF TRANSACTIONS IS CEITAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO CAUSE MUCH ANXIETY IN NEWV SOUTH WALES UP TO 1889 THERE HAD BEEN 209894 REGISTRATIONS AND ONLY 1172 LS PAID OUT OF THE ASSURANCE FUND SHOWING AN AVERAGE RISK OF ERROR ON EACH TRANSACTION OF 1 PENNY 3 FARTHINGS IN TASMANIA AFTER 29 YEARS OF ACTIVE OPERATION NO ERRORS WERE SHOWN UP TO THE END OF 1891 IN WEST AUSTRALIA NO ERRORS APPEARED AFTER 16 YEARS UNDER THE TORRENS BILL I HAVE NO LATER STATISTICS FROM THESE COUNTRIES IT MAY BE ADDED THAT NO ERRORS HAVE BEEN REPORTED SO FAR AS I KNOW IN AMERICA NOR HAVE I HEARD OF ANY OTHERS ELSEWHERE AND AFTER ALL WHAT IS PROCESS  IS IT ANYTHING MORE THAN NOTICE  AND WHAT IS PERSONAL SERVICE OF PROCESS  IS IT ANYTHING MORE THAN NOTICE BOUGHT HOME TO THE PERSON AND IS THERE ANY SPECIAL VIRTUE OR MAGIC IN HAVING THAT NOTICE BROUGHT HOME TO THE PERSON BY A SHERIFF THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THIS WAS THE BEST OR ONLY WAY BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED AND IT MAY BE SAID TO BE UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED THAT FOR ALL BUSINESS PUR656 11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC POSES THERE IS NO BETTER AGENICY THAN THE POST OFFICE REGISTRY DE PARTMENT TO CARRY ANY NOTICE HOME TO ANY PERSON ANYWHERE AND BRING BACK A RETURN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE RECEIPT OF NOTICE CAN THIS STATEMENT BE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED III JUDGE PHLEGAR OBJECTS THAT THE PROPOSED BILL WILL RESULT IN AN ABSOLUTE TIE UP OF EQUITABLE ESTATES BUIT A CAREFUL READ ING OF SECTION 38 WILL SHOW THAT IF THERE IS ANY TIE UP IT WILL BE DUE TO THE CREATOR OF THE ESTATE IF HE NISHES THE CESTUI QUE TRUST OR BENEFICIARY TO HAVE THE JUS DISPONENDI IT IS EASY ENOUGH TO GIVE THAT POWER IN EXPRESS TERMS IF NO SUCH POWER BE GIVEIL IN EXPRESS TERMS IT CANI ONLY BE DECLARED WITH CERTAINTY TO EXIST BY THE DECREE OF SOME COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IV THE OBJECTIONS TO SECTIONS 39 AND 40 IF FAIRLY SUSTAINED CAN BE READILY REMOVED BY A SIINPLE AMENDMENT THE INTERPO SITION OF THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE TO HOLD THE TITLE TO LAND DUR ING THE SETTLEMENT OF DECEDENTS ESTATES IS IN LINE WITH THE BEST MODERN THOUGHT AND PRACTICE THE PRINCIPLE IS EMBODIED IN THE GREAT ENGLISH LAND TRAINSFER AET OF 1897 FOR A BRIEF DISCUS SION OF WHICH I REFER TO VI VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER PP 6668 JUDGE PHLEGAR OBJECTS THAT HEIRS MUST SUE STARVE OR INDEMNIFY BEFORE THEY CAN GET POSSESSION HE SEEMS TO OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT SECTION 40 DECLARES THAT THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES SHALL HOLD THE REAL ESTATE AS TRUSTEES FOR THE PERSONS BY LAW ENTITLED THERETO BUT SHALL BE ENTITLED TO NO COMMISSIONS THEREON EXCEPT IN CASES OF NECESSARY SALES IN DUE COURSE OF ADMINISTRATION IF THERE BE ANY DANGEROF THE HEIRS BEING KEPT OUT OF POSSESSION UNDER THIS PROVISION THE SECTIONS MAY BE AMENDED BY EXPRESSLY PROVIDING THAT THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES SHALL SIMPLY HOLD THE TITLE TO THE ESTATES CONFERRED UIPON THEM BY SECTIONS 39 AND 40 V JUDGE PHLEGAR OBJECTS THAT THE LONG ESTABLISHED AND BENE FICIAL POLICY OF QUIETING TITLE BY ACTUAL ADVERSARY POSSESSION IS ABOLISHED THIS IS THE PLAIN DECLARATION OF SECTION 47 BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE CASE COULD BE DIFFERENT EVEN IF THAT SECTION HAD BEEN OMITTED THE CARDINAL DOCTRINE OF THE TOR RENS SYSTEM IS IHAT TITLE CAN PASS ONLY BY REGISTRATION THIS PRE CLUDES ALL NECESSITY FOR QUIETING TITLE BY THE SLOW UNCERTAIN AND EXPENSIVE METHOD OF ACTUAL ADVERSARY POSSESSION  AND IT ALSO PRECLUDES THE POSSIBILITV OF ANY POSSESSION BEING ADVERSARY IN ANY WAY TO CONFER TITLE IT WILL BE A HAPPY DAY FOR THE OWNERS1905 THE TORRENS SYSTEM 657 OF REAL ESTATE IN VIRGINIA WHEN THE REIGN OF THE SQUATTER IS ENDED AND THE DANGER OF TRAMP AND ROBBER TITLES IS FOREVER BANISHED BUT IN ORDER THAT THERE MAY BE NO MISUNDERSTANDINIG ATTENTION IS CALLED TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL NOR IN SECTION 47 TO ABOLISH THE DOCTRINE OF ADVERSE POSSESSION AS TO UNREGISTERED LANDS IT IS TRUE THAT SECTION 49 ADMITS THE POSSIBILITY OF CONFLICTING CLAIMS BETWEEN REGISTERED OWNERS IT DOES SO BOLDLY AND ATTEMPTS NO CONCEALMENT OF THE FACT BUT PLEASE OBSERVE THAT SUCH CONFLICTS CAN ONLY ARISE FROM CONFLICTING SURVEYS AND AS THESE SURVEYS ARE TO BE MADE BY THE COLNTY SURVEYORS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE COURT IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE CONFLICTING CLAIMS WILL EVER BE SERIOUS IT CERTAINLY REQUIRES SOME STRETCH OF IMAGINATION TO CONCEIVE OF SUCH A CASE AS THAT DEPICTED BY JUDGE PHLEGAR MOD ERN SURVEYS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE MADE FOR THE OLD LAND GRANTS WITH WHICH HE HAS HAD TO DEAL NOTHING CAN GIVE MORE REPOSE TO SOCIETY THAN THE OPERATION OF A TORRENS ACT THE CHIEF PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO SETTLE TITLES AND THE CHIEF GLORY OF WHICH IS THAT IT DOES SETTLE TITLES VI JUDGE PHLEGAR OBJECTS TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COURT OF LAND REGISTRATION UPON THIS POINT I REFER TO MY ARTICLE IN THE SEPTEMBER LAW REGISTER THE CONSTITUTION CONTEMPLATES A SPE CIAL COURT OR COURTS AND EVERY CIRCUIT JUDGE WITH WHOM I HAVE TALKED HAS EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT IT WILL BE BETTER TO HAVE A SPECIAL COURT THE REASONS IN SUPPORT OF THIS VIEW ARE TO MY MIND OVERWHELMING IN NO OTHER WAY CAN UNIFORMITY OF PRAC TICE AND DECISIONS BE SECURED AND ONE OF MY CHIEF REGRETS IS THAT BY REASON OF HIS SEAT IN THE SENATE JUDGE PHLEGAR IS INELIGIBLE TO FILL THE PROPOSED BENCH FOR WHICH HIS DEEP LEARNING AND WIDE EXPERIENCE HAVE SO WELL FITTED HIM A STUDY OF THE BILL WILL SHOW THAT NO PAINS HAVE BEEN SPARED TO BRING EVERY PROCEEDING FOR REGIS TRATION HOME TO THE PEOPLE ALL THE RECORDS ARE KEPT AT HOME AND I AM CONFIDENT EXPERIENCE WILL QUICKLY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COURT OF LAND REGISTRATION WILL PROVE AS LITTLE INCONVENIENT AS ANY COURT CAN BE THE CIRCUIT COURTS ARE STEADILY BECOMING MORE BURDENED WITH BUSINESS AND WILL BE MORE AND MORE CROWDED AS POPULATION AND TRADE INCREASES THE GENERAL OPINION IS THAT THEY COULD NOT SATISFACTORILY ASSUME THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION OF THE REG TRATION OF TITLES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COURT OF LAND REGIS658 11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC TRATION WILL RELIEVE THEM OF MUCH TEDIOUS BUSINESS AND TEND TO PREVENT THE NECESSITY FOR AN INCREASE OF THE CIRCUITS A MOVE MENT HAS ALREADY BEEN BEGUN IN RICHMOND FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANOTHER COMMON LAW COURT AND DOUBTLESS THERE ARE OTHER SEC TIONS OF THE STATE SUFFERING AS WE ARE FOR THE NEED OF MORE COURTS ALL THAT JUDGE PHLEGAR SAYS ABOUT THE ANNOVANCE AND EXPENSE OF A SPECIAL COURT IS FULLY ANSWERED BY ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IN VIRGINIA WITLH OUR STATE CORPORATION COMMISSION WOOULD JUDGE PHLEGAR OR ANY OTHER CITIZEN OF VIRGINIA NOT CONTROLLED BY PERSONAL INTERESTS LIKE TO ABOLISH THAT SPECIAL COURT BECAUSE IT USUALLY SITS IN PIICHMOND PEOPLE APPEAR BEFORE THE CORPORATION COMMISSION WHENEVER THEY THINK IT WILL PAY THEM TO DO SO AND IT WILL BE THE SAME CASE WITH THE COURT OF LAND REGISTRATIONI NO MAN WILL ATTEMPT TO HAVE HIS LAND REGISTERED UNLESS HE THINKS IT WILL PAY HIM TO DO SO IT IS TRUE THAT EVERY ADJOINING LAND OWNER MUST SEE THAT THE SURVEY OF THE TRACT OFFERED FOR REGISTRATION DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY OF HIS PROPERTY BUT IT IS NOT TRUE THAT HE MUST WATCH THE ENTIRE PROCEEDINRGS OR HE MAY LOOSE SOME OR ALL OF HIS LAND HOW COULD JUDGE PHLEGAR MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT UNLESS HE HAD BEEN CARRIED IIITO EXTREMES BY THE ZEAL OF THE ADVOCATE I MULST REMIND HIM ALSO THAT EVERY ADJOINING LAND OWNER MUST WATCH HIS NEIGHBOR NOW EVERY TIME HE HAS HIS LAND SURVEYED OR CHANGES A LINE FENCE ONE DIFFERENCE IS THAT HE MAY HAVE NO NOTICE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS UNDER OUR PRESCENT LAWS UNTIL HE HAS LOST HIS PROPORTY WHILE HE MUIST BE NOTIFIED UNDER THE TORRENS B3ILL BEFORE ANYTHING IS DONE TO AFFECT HIS TITLE IS THAT ANY HARDSHIP IS IT NOT RATHER PLAIN JUSTICE AND A BENEFIT TO ALL CONCERNED IF THERE IS ANY DISPUTE OR POSSI BLE CONFLICT ABOUT BOUNDARIES THE SOONER THE MATETR IS CLEARED UP AND FOREVER SETTLED THE BETTER VII I AM GLAD JUDGE PHLEGAR HAS TAKEN THE PAINS TO CATA LOGUE THE STEPS NECESSARY FOR ORIGINAL REGISTRATION FOR HE RENDERS IT EASY FOR ANY ONE TO OBSERVE THE VERY GREAT CARE TAKEN TO GIVE THOROUGH NOTICE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND PREVENT MISTAKES THE BILL CANNOT BE DISCREDITED IN THE MINDS OF THOUGHTFUL AND IMPAR TIAL CRITIES BY THE FACT THAT IT REQUIRES THE EXERCISE OF EXTREME CAUTION AND CALM JUDICIAL DETERMINATION BEFORE A TITLE CAN BE REGISTERED1905 THE TORRENS SYSTEM 659 JUDGE PHLEGARS QUESTIONS CONCERNING REGISTRATION ON THE DUPLI CATE CERTIFICATES SHOW THAT HE HAS NOT WELL CONSIDERED THE MATTER THE DUPLICATE CERTIFICATE IS SIMPLY A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL CERTIFI CATE WHICH LATTER PERPETUALLY REMAINS IN THE CLERKS OFFICE AND IS THE FINAL RECORD OF THE TITLE A DUPLICATE IS SIMPLY GIVEN TO THE OWNER FOR HIS CONVENIENCE AND HAS NO INHERENT VIRTUE BUT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE OWNER AND OF THOSE WITH WHOM HE MAY WISH TO DEAL THE BILL PROVIDES MEASURES TO CAUSE THE DUPLICATES TO CON TINUE EXACT COPIES OF THE ORIGINALS SEE SECTION 34 IT IS THERE FORE ABSURD TO TALK ABOUT SELLING OR BUYING A DUPLICATE CER TIFICATE WHAT ONE SELLS OR BUYS IS THE TITLE OF WHICH THE DUPLI CATE CERTIFICATE IS ONLY SECONDARV EVIDENCE NONE BUT A VERY FOOLISH OR IGNORANT PERSON WOULD ATTEMPT TO BUY A TITLE UPON THE SOLE EVIDENCE OF A DUPLICATE CERTIFICATE UNLESS HE HAD ABSOLUTE CON FIDENCE IN THE PERSON WITH WHOM HE WAS DEALING A PRUDENT PUR CHASER WILL ALWAYS COMPARE THE LAST ENTRY ON THE DUPLICATE WITH THE LAST ENTRV ON THE ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE WHICH CAN ALWAYS BE DONE WITHOUT THE HELP OF A LAWYER BUT THE CULMINATION OF JUDGE PHLEGARS ARGUMENT IN THIS DI VISION OF HIS PAPER IS HIS CALCULATION THAT IT WILL COST 22654 00000 TO REGISTER ALL THE LANDS IN THE STATE LET US CONSIDER WHAT REGISTRATION MEANS IT MEANS AT LEAST THESE THINGS FIRST THE SETTLING OF TITLES NOT FOR A DAY BUT FOR ALL TIME SECOND THE PREVENTION OF ENDLESS CAUSES OF LITIGATION ARIS ING FROM BAD AND DOUBTFUL TITLES THIRD THE ABOLITION OF THE NECESSITY FOR THE ENDLESS EXAMI NATION OF TITLES BY EXPERTS FOURTH THE SAVING OF THE COST OF SUCH ENDLESS EXAMINATION OF TITLES BY EXPERTS FIFTH THE SAVING OF THE TIME REQUIRED FOR SUCH ENDLESS EX AMINATIONS OF TITLES BY EXPERTS SIXTH THE ADDITION OF A MERCHANTABLE QUALITY TO TITLES RENDER ING LANDS MARKETABLE AND A SOURCE OF READY COMMERCIAL CREDIT FOR SHORT LOANS AS WELL AS SMALL LOANS SEVENTH THE ENORMOUS INCREASE OF THE BANKABLE CAPITAL OF VIRGINIA MULTIPLYING IT NEARLY THREEFOLD AS I HAVE SHOWN IN OTHER WRITINGS660 1 1 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC EIGHTH THE EMANCIPATION OF THE OWNERS OF SMALL HOMES FROM THE HANDS OF THE MONEYSHARKS WHO NOW CHARGE OUTRAGEOUS RATES FOR SMALL LOANS AS I HAVE ALSO ELSEWHERE SHOWN NINTH THE FREE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE BY SETTLING TITLES IN A COMPARATIVELY CHEAP EXPEDITIOLUS AND MOST EFFECTIVE MAN ER TENTH THE AUGMIENTATION OF THE REVENUES OF THE STATE FROM THE INCREASED VALUES OF HER LANDS ELEVENTH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF IMMIGRATION BY THE CERTAIN TY OF GOOD TITLES OF COURSE IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO EXPECT ANY SUCH RESULTS ABSO LUTELY FREE OF COST IT WOULD ALSO BE FOLLY TO EXPECT ALL THE LANDS OF VIRGINIA TO BE REGISTERED AT ONCE OR TO EXPECT ALL THE GOOD RESULTS OF REGISTRATION TO BE REALIZED AT ONCE THE PROCESS OUGHT TO BE AND WILL NECESSARILY BE SLOW BUT LET US DO SOME FIGURING OF OUR OWN THE TOTAL ASSESSED VALUE OF REAL ESTATE IN VIRGINIA IS 34379031600 EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT ASSESSMENTS ARE GEN ERALLY FAR BELOW ACTUAL VALUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT EVEN TAKING THE FIGURES GIVEN IT WILL APPEAR THAT JUDGE PHLEGARS ESTI MATE OF THE TOTAL COST OF REGISTRATION WOULD ONLY BE ABOUT SIX AND TWOFIFTHS PER CENT OF THE PRESENT ASSESSED VALUES THE LAWYERS OF ROANOKE CHARGE ONE PET CENT OF THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY FOR EACH AND EVERY EXAMINATION OF TITLEAND THIS IS AN ENDLESS TAX IT WOULD NOT TAKE MANY TRANSFERS UNDER OUR PRESENT SYSTEM TO EQUAL THE COST OF REGISTRATION UNDER THE TORRENS SYSTEM CORRESPONDENCE CONDUCTED BY ME WITH CLERKS OF COURTS THROUGH OUT THE COMMONWEALTH SHOWS THAT IT COST THE PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA NO LESS THAN 42182000 FOR THE EXAMINATION OF TITLES ALONE IN 1904 THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN AVERAGE CHARGE OF 1000 IN THE CITIES AND 500 IN THE COUNTIES FOR EACH TITLE TRANSFERRED THIS WAS NEARLY AS MUCH AS WAS SPENT UPON ALL THE PUIBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE 100 COUNTIES OF OUR STATE AND MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT WAS SPENT FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION IN EVERY CITY AND COUNTY IN THE STATE IF OUR LANDS HAD BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE TORRENS SYSTEM THAT SNUG SUM WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED TO THE PEOPLE I DO NOT SAY THAT MY FIGURES ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT BUT I DO DECLARE THAT THEY PRESENT A FAIR ESTIMATE FREQUENTLY THE CHARGE FOR A SINGLE EXAINI NATION OF TITLE WILL RUN UP INTO THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A LETTER WAS READ FROM A DISTINGUISHED LAWYER OF SOUTH WEST VIRGINIA1905 THE TORRENS SYSTEM 661 BY AN OPPONENT OF MY BILL IN THE LAST LEGISLATURE STATING THAT THE USUAL CHARGE FOR EXAMINING THE TITLE TO TRACTS OF 100 ACRES OF LAND IN THAT SECTION OF THE STATE WAS FROM 5000 TO 25000 THAT FOR LARGER TRACTS THE CHARGE RANGED FROM 100000 TO 2000 00 AND THAT HE HAD KNOWN INSTANCES IN WHICH 500000 HAD BEEN PAID A FEW INSTANCES LIKE THESE WOULD MATERIALLY RAISE THE AVER AGE OF MY ESTIMATES AND ENOUGH EAN BE COUNTED ON TO SATISFY ANY UNPREJUDICED MIND THAT MY FIGURES ARE NOT EXCESSIVE THE ROA NOKE CHARGE OF 1 PER CENT WOULD ALSO LIFT THE AVERAGE OF MY CITY ESTIMATES MUCH ABOVE THE ESTIMATE OF 1000 AND A CONSIDERATION OF THE RICHMOND CHARGES IS LIKEWISE CONVINCING THAT MY FIGURES ARE MODERATE AGAIN THE REGISTRATION OF TITLE IS A PERMANENT IMPRDVEIMENT TO REAL ESTATE THIS STATEMENT IS MADE AND CAN BE ACCEPTED WITH OUT QUALIFICATION WE ARE HOWEVER ACCUSTOMED TO THE UISE OF THESE WORDS IN CASES WHERE THEY SHOULD BE SEVERELY QUALIFIED WE SPEAK OF BUILDINGS AND EVEN OF FENCES AS PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR LANDS BUT CONSTRUCT YOUR HANDSOME RESIDENCE ERECT YOUR AMPLE BARNS AND BUILD YOUR BEST FENCES IF YOU PLEASE IN A FEW MONTHS OR CERTAINLY IN A FEW YEARS THE PLUMBER THE TINNER THE MASON THE CARPENTER AND THE PAINTERONE OR ALL OF THEM MUST BE CALLED INTO REQUISITION AND THE TAXGATHERER IMMEDIATELY RAISES YOUR ASSESSMENT SO THAT INSTEAD OF MAKING A PERMANENT IMPROVEMENT YOU HAVE IN REALITY ONLY INVITED A HIGHER PERMANENT TAX BUT WHEN YOU ONCE REGISTER THE TITLE TO YOUR LAND YOU HAVE TRULY MADE A PERMANENT IMPROVEMENT TO YOUR PROPERTY YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING THAT WILL ENDURE AS LONG AS THE COM MONWEALTH SURVIVES AND AS LONG AS THE REIGN OF LAW CONTINUES YOU THINK NOTHING OF SPENDING 5000 OR 10IQ00 ON YOUR BARN OR PERISHABLE FENCES WILL YOU HESITATE TO SPEND A SIMILAR AMOUNT IF NECESSARY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF A PERPETUAL BENEFIT THE BUILD INGS IN VIRGINIA ARE ASSESSED AT 14794959900 IF THE PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT IT WELL TO SPEND THAT MUCH FOR THESE SOCALLED PERMA NENT IMPROVEMENTS IT DOES NOT SEEM UNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THEY MIGHT THINK IT WISE TO INVEST EVEN 2265400000 OR 15 PER CENT OF THE BUILDING ASSESSMENTS TO SECURE A REAL PERMANENT IMPROVE MENT TO THEIR LANDS AND PLEASE REMEMBER AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT NO ONE WILL REGISTER HIS LANDS UNLESS HE THINKS IT WILL PAY AND WHY SHOULD JUDGE PHLEGAR OR ANY OTHER OPPONENT662 11 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC OF THE TORRENS SYSTEM OBJECT TO THE COST OF REGISTRATION THE BILL LEAVES IT ENTIRELY OPTIONAL WITH EVERY OWINER WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL REGISTER HIS PROPERTY AND IF THE COST OF REGISTRATION WILL IN REALITY BE SO OUTRAGEOUS OPPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM OUGHT TO SAY NOTH ING ABOUT IT BUT REJOICE IN SECRET BECAUSE NO ONE WILL REGISTER AND THE BILL WILL KILL ITSELF MOST EFFECTUALLY BUT LET US APPLY JUDGE PHLEGARS ARGUMENT TO OTHER CASES TAKE THE CASE OF THE RAILROADS FOR INSTANCE THE GROSS TRANSPORTATION RECEIPTS OF ALL THE STEAM RAILROADS IN THE STATE IN 1903 WAS 31 618 95300 THINK OF IT HOW CAN THE PEOPLE STAND IT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THERE WERE NO RAILROADS IN VIRGINIA A STATES MAN USING JUDGE PHLEGARS LINE OF ARGUMENT MIGHT THEN HAVE SAID IF YOU ARE SILLY ENOUGH TO CHARTER THESE RAILROADS AND ALLOW THEM TO DO BUSINESS IN VIRGINIA I TELL YOU THE TIME WILL COMNE WHEN THEY WILL WRING FROM OUR DEFENSELESS PEOPLE IN A SINIGLE YEAR MORE THAN ENOUGH TO PAY THE WHOLE STATE DEBT AND WLHAT DO YOU WANT WITH RAILROADS ANYHOW CANT YOU GET ABOUT FAST ENOUIGH IN YOUR OX CARTS  THIS LINE OF ARGUMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HURLED AGAINST EVERY ACHIEVEMENT OF MODERN CIVILIZATION AND BE OPPOSED TO EVERY SUGGESTION FOR FURTHER PROGRESS AND WHILE WE ARE CONSIDERING THE COST OF THE TORRENS SYSTEM AC CORDING TO JUDGE PHLEGARS FIGURES LET US ATTEMPT FOR A MOMENT TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF WHAT HE TERMS THE LONG ESTABLISHED AND BENE FICIAL POLICY OF QUIETING TITLE BY ACTUAL ADVERSARY POSSESSION HE TELLS US THAT THERE ARE 482800 TRACTS OR PARCELS OF LAND IN VIRGINIA TO QUIET THE TITLE TO THESE TRACTS BY ACTUAL ADVERSARY POSSESSION EACH ONE MUST BE COMPLETELY FENCED THERE ARE 25 081848 ACRES OF LAND IN THE STATE AND CONSIDERING ALL THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR BOUNDARIES IT SEEMS CONSERVATIVE TO SAY THAT THIS LARGE AND INTRICATE AREA COULD NOT BE FENCED FOR LESS THAN 12 PER ACRE THAT WOULD MEAN A COST OF 50 16369600 REMEMBER TOO THAT THE AVERAGE LIFE OF A FENCE IS NOT OVER 10 OR 15 YEARS BUT THESE FIGURES GIVE ONLY A PARTIAL IDEA OF THE COST OF QUIETING AND HOLDING TITLE BY ADVERSARY POSSESSION IF THE LOSS OF FULL USE ARND DEVELOPMENT DURING THE PERIOD OF DISQUIET AND UNCERTAINTY BE CONSIDERED IT WILL BE FOUND DIFFEULT TO ESTIMATE THE VAST LOSS NOT ONLY TO THE INDIVIDUAL HUT TO THE COMMONWEALTH AS WELL SURELY IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF SOMETHING BETTER THAN THE LONG1905 THE TORRENS SYSTEM 663 ESTABLISHED AND BENEFICIAL POLICY OF QUIETING TITLES BY ACTUAL ADVER SARYR POSSESSION AND SINCE THE EXPERIENCE OF MIIANY COTINTRIES HAS DEMONSTRATED THE FACT THAT THE TORRENS SYSTEM WILL DO THIS AS WELL AS OTHER HIGHLY BENEFICIAL THINGS SHALL WE NOT BE PERMITTED TO TRY IT IN VIRGINIA WE ONLY ASK THAT THOSE WLHO WISH TO TRY IT SHALL BE PERMITTED TO DO SO WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO FORCE IT UPON ANY ONE WHO DOES NOT DESIRE TO TEST ITS BENEFITS VIII THE LAST POINT MADE BY JUDGE PHLEGAR IS THAT CON CERNING THE CREATION OF ADDITIONAL OFFICERS WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED HLE ASSURES US HOWEVER THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER OBJECTIONS TO THE BILL WHICH IT IS UINNECESSARYR TO MENITION HERE EVEN IF SPACE ADMITTED OF DOING SO IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT HE WILL LET US KNOW EVERY OBJECTION THAT CAN BE ADVANCED AND THAT WHEN HE HAS EXHAUSTED HIS DESTRUCTIVE ABILITIES HE WILL LEND HIS GREAT CONSTRUCTIVE POWERS TO THE PERFECTION OF THE BILL AS YET HE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO SEE ANY GOOD WHATEVER IN THE MEASURE BUT HE MUST ADMIT THAT THE HISTORV AND FACTS CONCERNING REGISTRATION OF TITLE ENTITLE THE TORRENS SYSTEM TO RESPECTFUL CONSIDERATION AND PROVE THAT IT HAS AT LEAST OPERATED WITH GREAT SUCCESS IN MANY COUNTRIES AND UNDER THE MOST VARIED CONDITIONS LET US HOPE THAT THERE IS NOTHING SO PECULIAR ABOUT VIRGINIA THAT SHE IS DESTINED TO REMAIN FOREVER THE LAND OF THE BOURBONS THE PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA WANT AND ARE DEMANDING REFORM OF OUR LAND LAWS IN ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT THE PRACTICAL BUSINESS MEN OF THE STATE THINK OF THIS MOVEMENT IT MAY BE MENTIONED THAT THE RICHMOND CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND POST A T P A HAVE RECENTLY UNDERTAKEN TO PRINT AND DISTRIBUTE 100000 LEAFLETS ON THE SUBJECT WE MUST HAVE THE TORRENS SYSTEM AND NO ONE IS BETTER FITTED THAN JUDGE PHLEGAR TO BE OUR HONORED LEADER AS THE NOVEMBER REGISTER DID NOT REACH ME UNTIL THE 20TH AND I HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO PREPARE THIS MANUSCRIPT PRIOR TO THE 24TH I TRUST SOME ALLOWANCE WILL BE MADE FOR ANV EVIDENCE OF HASTE I SHALL ATTEMPT TO ANSWER IMR BULLITTS PAPER IN THE JANUARY REGISTER

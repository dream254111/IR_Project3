CRUELTY TO CHILDREN1 The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children occu pies a unique position in the metropolis It is at once a state agency and a private institution a seeming contradiction of terms but not so understood by those who know the causes underlying the granting of extraordinary legal powers to a private institution whose records are not public property The action of the legislature in delegating such authority to the societies organized in New York under the Membership Corporations Laws is thor oughly approved by judges and jurists and was indeed held by the Court of Appeals of New York State to have been a wise public policy The Society does a work of prevention the extent of which is not only little known but can probably never be fully understood by the general public It is necessarily a quiet work being of a more or less personal nature and requiring ceaseless attention night and day The community at large will never know the number of rescues of children from neglect and abuse and unspeakable cruelties which are being continually made by the Societys agents in New York City alone Annual reports and public statements can refer in but a very vague and general way to the breadth of the work and to the detail which can never be written Almost threequarters of a million of children have been involved in the investigations made by the Societys officers and the welfare of each of them contributed to directly or indirectly in such a manner as to have improved their condition in some way This IContributed by E Fellows Jenkins Secretary and Superintendent 492 Infant Mortality in the American Cities 193 some way may mean the absolute removal from improper guardians the commitment to institutions of such as require reformation or placing in suitable juvenile reformatories boys who have through their own mis conduct or the influence of others become such as to require that sort of care It may mean the releasing on parole of a larger number than was committed for any of the causes just stated It is worthy of note that 400 societies in fortyfour states of the Union are operating under laws based on those of New York for the prevention of cruelty to children This is quite a remarkable condition in view of the fact that the laws of most of the states on given subjects are widely divergent The world has watched the progress in New York the result of appeals to the higher courts from judgments made under the statutes whose passage was secured by the Society and has with remarkable unanimity adopted these same statutes in toto excepting with slight changes to meet local conditions The British Parliament in considering the application of the eminent ladies and gentlemen who applied for a Charter for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children London caused inquiry to be made of the conditions in New York and of the strength of the laws which had been in operation here for thirteen years A royal charter was granted to the great London Society whose magnificent organization is such that no child in Great Britian or Ireland is too far away to be visited on short notice by an inspector of the National Society and its conditions improved if need be In Scotland a similar institution does a similar work and so it is throughout most of the European countries in India South Africa Aus tralia Tasmania and South America This Societys great work still lies as much in the prosecution of offenders against children as in the prevention of cruelty to them The record of criminal prosecutions instituted by the Society the startling number of convictions the wellfilled cells in the State Prison speak more forcefully than statistics of the result of the work of prevention which had its origin in New York City The work is not limited to the removal of children from unfit homes Unfit homes there are as there aways have been and probably will be and it is in these places that the Society finds its great opportunity No one but the persons concerned can ever know what it means to visit a home of neglect and dissipation and miserable conditions to administer an official warning to return and find a partial improvement and as the visits continue to see unclean rooms become clean ones children better clad and drunken parents become sober because they fear the law Moral suasion is a fallacy with these people until the unfit guardians become more careful in their duties not bcause of any kindly word spoken but because of the fear which they entertain Ignorant and vicious people must be compelled to do what is right by the strong arm of the law But once this work of compulsion is begun once these people undergo the unpleasant experience of being visited at uncertain hours of the day and night once they realize that others will do for them that which they have neglected to do they wake up to the fact that theirs will be the loss Few fail to profit by it The Society never removes a child from any home unless the case is a hopeless one Removal 493194 The Annals of the American Academy in fact is the last resort But who will say that the little ones are not rescued when the Society steps in to take them from depraved and naturally unfit guardians Who will object to a childs removal from a brothel and its transfer to proper surroundings Who will say that little children should be permitted to be reared in scenes and homes of continual drunk enness  494

control The work of searching for the affinities of great groups is and those who were opposed to this were trying to get the the crying need of systematic botany today The speaker right to vote or refuse taxes Now every civilized country called attention to the danger of magnifying the importance in western Europe and America vests the right to say what of certain periods or organs in indicating affinities and taxes should be levied and how they shall be levied in the summed up what was said under this head as follows I people or their representatives It is accepted as a definite have thus spoken of the study of lifehistories to indicate principle that the people are the sole source of the authority to that its chief function lies in the field of systematic botany determine what taxes should be levied to suggest that it take into account development at every We have indeed always had that principle accepted in this period and of every organ and so obtain a mass of cumula country to a greater or less extent and in all its fulness tive evidence for safe generalization and to urge upon those ever since the Revolution People thought formerly that as not thoroughly equipped great caution in publication soon as that principle was accepted tax problems would be The speaker spoke of the necessity of constructing a natu solved But it did not take long to find out how great an ral system with easy advance in the knowledge of affinities error this notion was Hardly had the principle been ac as a convenient summary of information a sort of milepost cepted as a part of the fundamental law of the country when to tell of progress and to direct future effort The concluding the representatives of the people found out that they were summary was as follows The points presented in this con only at the verge so to speak of the question The political sideration of the third phase of systematic botany are that side of the problem had been settled to a certain extent but the last and highest expression of systematic work is the con that only left room for the economic aspect to appear in struction of a natural system based upon the accumulations sight with a vast array of the most difficult questions It of those who collect and describe and those who study life soon became e7ident that under the systems of taxation in histories that this work involves the completest command of existence some people paid more than they ought to and literature and the highest powers of generalization that it is some paid less Some classes were taxed but lightly or not essential to progress for a natural system to be attempted at all and others very heavily Then began the fight between with every advance in knowledge and that all the known the classes between those exempted by law and those sub facts of affinity thus brought within reach should be ex jected by law to taxation This conflict was slowly fought pressed in all systematic literature In conclusion I have through and now in nearly all civilized countries there are but to say that I have attempted to indicate the true relation few classes exempted by law from taxation But it was soon which exists among the different phases of systematic botany found that it was not necessary to exempt by law in order to point out an affinity which there is danger of ignoring and to take advantage of circumstances in such a way as to mate to maintain that all these departments of work looking to the rially lighten ones burdens Then began another struggle same end are equally important equally honorable between the various classes as to which could shift the burden of taxation more completely under the forms of law to the THE FARMER AND TAXATION1 shoulders of the other The town was arrayed against the country the producer against the consumer the rich against QUESTIONS of taxation have played a prominent part in the the poor the laborer against the capitalist etc We are still polity of Englishspeaking communities for many centuries in the thick of this ght and there is no sign of an end to and they have not been without importance in the history it It is raging in all countries alike Our tax problems of other civilized countries as well A history of English are not very different in some of their most important features taxation would be in no small part a history of the English from the tax problems of England France and Germany people itself and each of these countries can learn something from the It was a quarrel about taxation between the nobles andexperience the successes and failures of the others King John which led to the granting of the Great Charter The problem is all the more difficult because even if all and thus planted the seeds of modern constitutional govern parties were willing to do exactly the fair thing we should ment English liberty indeed has been developed chiefly in still find it difficult to determine exactly what the fair thing connection with disputes about taxation Charles I owed is Where you cannot obtai common consent as to whatis the loss of his throne and of his head largely to his deter fair and proper we need not expect that private individuals mination to levy such taxes as he pleased without consulting will relax their efforts to get exemptions and make laws un the great men of his realm English obstinacy in regard to der which they cn escape what others may consider their the principle of taxing the colonies led to the American Revo fair share of taxation lution and the disruption of the British Empire It was at The matter is destined to become more rather than less bottom a question of taxation which led to the French Revoimportant and that from several reasons In th first place lution and the turning and overturning of Europe whkch the amount of money to be raised by taxation is destined to has hardly ceased even now And the history of this cen increase pretty steadily if not very rapidly This fact of tury on the continent shows how fundamental tax questions course makes a bad system of taxation become worse with are to the welfare and prosperity of modern nations  every increase of the amount If for example we had in Of late the question has become of even more importance this country to raise only a small sum for public purposes and has acquired a very different aspect from that of former say ten million dollars in all for federal state and loca centuries The disputes about taxation were down to a re governments it would not matter much how we raised it cent date largely of a political nature They turned not so We might have an income tax on all incomes over ten thou much on the amount of the tax or the manner in wphich it sand dollars a year or on all incomes of less than that or a Address before the Section of Economic Sciepce and Statistics of the uniform tax on lands irrespective of their value or even on American Association for the Advancement of Science at Washington DC Aug 1925 1891 by Edmund J James vicepresident of the section polls and while it might be very unequal yet the wholeSEPTEMBER 4 I89I SCIEL amount would be so slight that it would not be worth while complaining about it Even such a sum as a hundred mil lion a year could be raised very easily by almost any system of taxation But when you want to raise seven hundred millions it is a very different matter A system of taxation which would yield a small sum becomes absolutely insup portable when you attempt to raise a large sum by it There are some theorists it is true who maintain that all the revenues necessary for public purposes could be raised easily by a land tax or by an income tax or by an excise tax Such people have given little study to the organic nature of the State In determining how much of a burden an organic body can bear you must consider not only the weight itself but also its distribution Take a soldier for example Would you measure the burden which he could carry in the field by the amount he could drag in the shape of an iron ball attached to one of his feet or the amount he could carry in one hand or suspended from one finger  Of course not Every one recognizes that a load which would tire a man out completely in a few hours if placed on one part of the body can be carried for an indefinite period if only it be properly distributed So with taxation Any single tax presses down and destroys or tends to destroy some one part of the eco nomic body Increase it and you not only destroy that part but by sympathy the whole body economic Given a sys tem of taxation then which will yield a certain revenue easily without injuring any part of the body economic if you double the amount to be raised you will in all proba bility make the system absolutely insupportable Now this is exactly what we have done in this country We have in essence the same systemn of taxation which was in vogue a hundred years ago Indeed we may say that in all its most important features it is the same as was adopted in England in the time of Queen Elizabeth for our ancestors brought it with them and adopted it almost without change when they settled the country In the mean time our in dustry has changed our agriculture has changed we have changed our style of dress We wear different hats a better boot and shoe we drive a better horse milk a better cow fatten a better hog have invented a new plough invented and utilized the railroad steamboat mowingmachine reaper selfbinder etc but we stick to an antiquated system of taxa tion which was not very good at the time it was adopted and has become worse ever since If we were willing to abolish the public school system entirely give up trying to improve the roads starve the inmates of our jails and almshouses tie up our insane to a post until they die of starvation and neglect go back to the fourteenth century system of sanita tion abolish universal suffrage and set up a class of nobles and kings to rule over us perhaps we could get money enough out of the community to serve such public purposes as would then be necessary by the system of taxation which we now have I take it however that we are not aoing to do any of these things On the contrary we propose to have better schools better roads take better care of our poor be more reasonable in our treatment of the insane and criminal classes establish better conditions of public health do more to develop our industries in a word we propose to advance and not decline in civilization All this will require more m oney than we have now and a system of public revenue nmust be established which will not only enable us to raise the sums at present demanded but very much larger sums and at a less cost of effort Think for a moment how enormously the expenditure for public purposes has increased of late years in all civilized NCE I29 countries The ordinary expenditures of the Federal Gov ernment for the decade 17911800 were about four millions of dollars For the decade 18701879 it was more than forty times as much while the population was only about twelve times as great In the State of New York the amount raised by taxation rose from twenty millions in 1861 to fifty millions in 1870 in Massachusetts from eight to twentytwo millions in the same period approximately and in Ohio from eleven to twentytwo In the fifteen years from 1860 to 1875 the total amount raised by taxation rose in Baltimore by 110 per cent in Boston 241 Brooklyn 313 Chicago 1445 Cincin nati 377 Detroit 384 Louisville 318 Milwaukee 326 Newark 558 New York 430 Philadelphia 317 etc For fourteen large cities the amount of increase was 363 per cent while the population increased only seventy per cent Now it is plain that a tax system which might have been at least bearable in 1860 was in all probability out of all reason in 1875 when nearly four times the revenue had to be raised by it Taking all the cities in Massachusetts they paid six dollars per head in taxes in 1861 and over seventeen dollars in 1875 The city debts had increased from less than eight dollars per head to over fiftyfour per head Even if we take the period after the war from 1866 to 1876 and take the average of 130 cities in the United States including therefore the smaller ones also it will be seen that the taxes rose from sixtyfour to one hundred and thirteen million dollars They have not declined since but have all risen at least as rapidly as the population This phenomenon is not by any means confined to our own country but is quite as noticeable abroad The expenses of Vienna rose from thirtyseven to sixtyseven million francs in the years from 1865 to 1874 Breslan from four to eight Florence froin nine to twentyfour Berlin from eighteen to fortysix Paris rose from eightythree to one hundred and ninetysix million francs in ten years Thirtytwo cities of Prussia increased their taxes eightythree per cent in seven years A moments reflection will convince any of you of the enormous increase in this burden even if you did not have these figures You all know that the expense for schools has become enormously greater than formerly Every country district must now have its school taught from five to six months in the year by a teacher who gets on the average nearly twice as much as two generations ago Every little village must have its system of graded schools and if it gets a trifle larger must have its high school We are now calling for manual training in the schools and we are no longer satisfied with the horrible accommodations for teacher and pupils which used to satisfy our fathers Our poorhouses must be at least halfway decent places our jails are vastly improved etc In a word our expenditures are vastly greater and conse quently the sum of money to be raised by taxation As a result the revenue system has broken down and there are loud calls for a better one Now in deciding upon a system of public revenue two things are to be kept in view We must first of all find out where the wealth is that we wish to reach and second we must then adopt the best system we can devise to find and tax that wealth There is no use of adopting specific taxes unless there is something to be taxed Now here is just the difficulty in our present condition Our tax system does not correspond to our industrial condi tions It was devised in all its essential features over three130 SCIENCE centuries ago and has undergone little change If we except the indirect taxes like customs duties our present system is based on the idea that the chief wealth of the country is in its agricultural districts in its farms and consequently it is adapted to reach the main elements in such a condition of society But nothing could be further from the truth It was so a century ago but has long ceased to be so In 1790 there was no railroad in the country scarcely any banks few trades little manufacturing scarce a dozen cor porations in the whole country no very large cities and ninetyseven per cent of the people lived in the country What wealth there was was in the countryin the farms and lands and farm products A system of taxation based on this fact worked fairly well iHow is it now  Where is the bulk of the wealth of this great country of ours  It is no longer in the country it is in the cities in and around which nearly half the population is aggregated It is no longer in agriculture it is in rail roads it is in gas companies in streetcar lines in merchan dizing and trading everywhere but in farming The earn ings of the railroads of the country during the year 1888 were over one thousand millions of dollars We have no reports as yet on the earnings of gas companies electriclight companies telephone companies streetcar lines telegraph companies express companies sleepingcar companies man ufacturing corporations standard oil monopoly cottonseed oil trust They mount up into the hundreds of millions every year The profit of trade in the agricultural products of the country alone amount to more than the total value of those products only a few decades back In a word the wealth has been steadily flowing away from the farms and into other forms This has come about in two ways first by the natural increase of manufacturing industry and of commerce in an age of steam and electricity which would show relative in crease of capital invested in those branches and second by the actual fall of late years in all farm values in the old and settled communities incident to the opening up of new fields which are enabled to compete in the worlds market by the cheapening of transportation in railway and steamship ser vice Not only Dakota and Montana compete in London with the Pennsylvania wheat but also India Russia and even Africa There has been a great fall of late in the value of farm staples in the worlds market which has depressed the value of farms in all the settled countries in England France and Germany as well as in our Eastern States There are no signs that those prices will go up again at least in your day and mine Africa South America India Russia and Australia will be opened up faster than the demand for breadstuffs will in crease and you may be sure that Europe will not pay as high prices for our surplus wheat and corn when it can get cheaper supplies elsewhere We need expect then no recov ery in farm values so far as these depend on the price of staple commodities In examining this question of taxation then let us im press upon our minds several points first that we cannot hope to get money where it is not no matter how good our system may be second that the wealth of the country is no longer in its farms third that the present revenue system is based on that supposition and that consequently our whole revenue system must be radically changed to bring it into harmony with our modern industrial conditions No mere tinkering or pottering around with existing taxes is going to help We must make up our minds to go to the VOL XVIII No 44S root of the matter at once recognize that if we wish revenue we must reach the place where it is and not try to get it from where it is not Before proposing our remedy it is desirable to glance at our present system and its effect We have already seen that it is inadequate to meet the demands we are making and shall make upon it It is simply impossible to get adequate revenue from it There is however another reason why our present revenue system is unsatisfactory besides the mere reason that it can not meet the heavier demands upon it ie than its insuffi ciency to get the necessary revenue and that is that owing to the great changes in our industry it has become grossly unjust We may characterize the system as a whole as the generat property tax system ie the effort is made to ascertain the valuation of the entire property belonging to every taxa ble and then to collect a certain per cent of that valuation for the use of the public Even if it were possible to ascertain such value and collect the tax levied upon it the system would be a grossly unequal one and undesirable from many points of view It would tax for example the thrifty far mer who had accumulated from his savings a sum sufficient to purchase a small farm in proportion to his thrift and sav ings while it would let the extravagant lawyer or physician who makes thousands of dollars every year and lives it all up go scotfree of all taxation All those classes who use up their income as they go along would escape taxation while those who save and invest it in some form of property would have to bear all the burden of taxation It would in a word discourage savings and encourage waste Such a tax makes no distinction between the people of small property and those of large means The true principle of taxation is not every one in propor tion to his property but every one in proportion to his ability and ability is not measured by possession of property alone since a man of large means may better afford to give a larger sum than a person of small means a small sum A general property tax moreover takes no account of whether the prop erty is available for purposes of income or not A person is taxed upon what he has irrespective of the fact whether he can get anything out of it or not And so I might go on and show how unequal and wasteful such a tax is even if it could be fully assessed and collected but the fundamental objection to it is that it can never be assessed and collected To make it even approximately complete you must rely on the declaration of the taxable that he has given a full and true list of his property A portion of this property can of course be seen such as houses and lands and furniture im plements and tools pictures books pianos etc But another class cannot be seen such arestocks and bonds notes mort gages where owned outside of the community etc and all other forms of immaterial rights It is impossible to assess these things except upon the personal declaration of the owner Now everybody who has looked into the matter at all agrees I believe that this cannot be relied upon at all All tax commissions which have reported upon this point say that existing laws do not secure such a return Taxables commit perjury by wholesale in such matters and think nothing of it How much of this sort of property escapes taxation can be seen from examining the tax books and re ports of any of our leading American cities We have of course no adequate statistics of the relative value of person alty and real estate for any country or part of a country No one however estimates the value of the personal propSEPTEMBER 4 1891 SCIENCE 13 erty held by the inhabitants of a great city at anything less with which it escapes taxation This is a phenomenon of than the total value of the real estate and it is my opinion comparatively recent date The corporation first became a that it is much more According to the report of the tax prominent feature of our industrial life as of that of other commission of the State of New York in 1871 the real estate countries since 1850 There were of course many corpora assessed in that State for the years 186970 was more than tions before that date and one or two flush periods when three and onehalf times as valuable as all the personal prop nearly everybody took a hand in them but they were con erty owned by citizens of that State In the city of Brooklyn fined to few departmentsof industry After 1850 they grew the valuation of real estate was over ten times as much as rapidly In Germany for example only 54 are known to that of personal property Rochester over six times Buffalo have been founded before 1850 while 1150 have been formed and Albany over four times as much In the city of New since that time In Austria there were in 1857 only 58 in York it was nearly two and onehalf times as much One all but they had risen to 731 by 1873 England and America county in New York reports real estate worth seventy times are however the classic lands for the development of cor as much as all the personal property owned by its citizens porations In 1844 there were 119 in England but they had Massachusetts which has perhaps the best enforced law of increased to 2549 in 1862 and by 1886 over 25000 had taken this kind does not reach over two thirds of the personal out charters though many of them had wound up their property in the opinion of its tax collectors Connecticut affairs so that only 11000 were in operation in that year misses forty per cent One may almost say that in the large with a paid up capital of over three thousand millions of cities much the larger half of the personal property escapes dollars taxation altogether That means of course that the other Tn this country we have accurate statistics only for a few forms of property are disproportionately burdened The of the States and then only in regard to certain formal facts total personal property of the entire State of New York was In Massachusetts from 1852 to 1863 anywhere from ten to returned in 1870 at 434000000 Why there were at that fifty companies were formed each year The next three years time in the city of New York alone twentyfive individuals averaged three times as many then came a long period up who together probably possessed that sum The value of the to 1880 in whichl about seventyfive to one hundred were es steam railroads in that State in that year was 300000000 tablished each year and since 1880 an enormous number In a debate in the constitutional convention of 1867 Mr have been formed rising to 233 in 1889 The total capital Pierrepont of New York said that he could name thirty in of these companies aggregated upwards of 300000000 In dividuals in New York City whose combined personal prop the State of Ohio in 1889 over three hundred corporations erty exceeded the whole assessment of the State for that year for manufacturing purposes were organized and the average by a very large sum The whole personal property assess for the last ten years has been over two hundred Now all ment of the city of Brooklyn against private individuals for these things mean of course that property of the community the year 1867 was less than ten million dollars Possibly it is all the while taking on more and more the personal prop had a single citizen who was worth that amount erty form is leaving the country for the city and that any But why multiply examples They are like sands of the generalproperty tax system is becoming more and more un sea for multitude Now under any such a system as this equal owing to impossibility of keeping track of it With those classes who have comparatively speaking little per every passing year then our present system is becoming sonal property are the ones who must bear the burden of more and more untenable and yet we are not ready to break taxation Who are they  Speaking generally the farmer with it in the country and the small man in the city the laborer There is still another circumstance which should be con who has saved up money to buy him a little house and sidered in this connection before leaving it as having a whose whole property is therefore open to the assessor the special relation to the farming classes and that is the rapidly farmer who has put all his money into his farm Who profits changing proportion between town and country population by it  The man of means who invests his money in rail It is easier to avoid personal property taxation in the city roads bank stock gas companies etc than in the country And thus from this reason also the The objection which I have been urging against the gen burden of taxation becomes more unequal In 1790 only eralproperty tax which forms the backbone of our system three per cent of the population of the United States lived in would apply more or less to the system at all times but it is cities of 8000 and upwards In 1800 using round numbers becoming more and more potent as time goes on owing to four per cent in 1810 five per cent 1830 seven 1840 nine per the fact above mentioned that the proportion of wealth in an cent 1850 thirLeen 1860 sixteen 1870 twentyone and in immaterial form such as stocks and bonds is steadily in 1880 twentythree It is not yet known exactly what the creasing I hardly need to dwell upon this point You all new census will show in this respect as the population of all know how enormously the value of railroads in this country cities above eight thousand has not been given But some is increasing Nearly all of it consists of immaterial or per figures have been given to show that this tendency has steadily sonal property or where it consists of real estate the value increased In 1880 there were twentyfour cities in the of such real estate cannot be measured by the ordinary United States with 75000 inhabitants and over while in 1890 standards but it possesses a value growing out of the pecu this number had increased to thirtyfour ie while ten years liar business of the railroad whicil is rarely reflected as it ago about thirteen per cent of the people of the country were should be in the tax books The railroad is the most strik living in cities of 75000 and over today over sixteen per ing example but not even is it so important as the aggregate cent are to be found in such cities The increase of these of similar undertakings in other lines of business Consider thirtyfour cities without counting New York has been for a moment the stock of express companies telegraph com almost fortyfive per cent while the general increase in the panics telephone companies gas companies electric lighting country as a whole has not exceeded twentyfive per cent companies joint stock banks manufacturing companies etc Reports have been also published of fortytwo other cities Indeed the marked tendency of capital today isto assume having a population of 20000 or over The increase in the the corporate form owing among other things to the ease seventysix cities over the population of the same cities in132 SCIENCE 1880 was about fortyeight per cent The census may be faulty but I take it that we shall have to admit that growth of the cities has been much more rapid than that of the country This being so it still further tends to increase the burdens of those classes who can least easily conceal their property under a generalproperty tax system viz the far mers The rapid growth of the cities in many cases at the ex pense of the country tends moreover to leave a continually increasing burden of expense upon the shoulders of the rural districts which tends to overburden the latter still more Under our system of taxation then the farmer using that term for the country districts in general is at a disadvantage in several respects In the first place as we have seen our method of obtaining public revenue by taxation touches chiefly that form of property which is visible and can not escape the eye of the tax assesssor or tax collector while that which can be hidden or known only by a general sys tem of registry such as mortgages bonds stocks etc prac tically escapes taxation altogether Now the farmer has a larger proportion of his property in this form than any other class If he is thrifty he can buy more land put up a better class of buildings get a better breed of stock use better ma chinery etc Every improvement in his condition in a word reflects itself in something visible about the farm and thus subjects him to heavier taxation It is very different with the inhabitants of the cities A wealthy man of course occupies as a rule a better house in a dearer neighborhood than a poor man and to that extent pays more taxes but as his wealth increases his house does not necessarily grow better His scale of living may not increase proportionately A millionaire is quite as likely to live on as great a scale as one who has ten times the property As a result the visible forms of wealth do not increase as rapidly in the case of the wealthy city man as in the case of the country farmer More and more of the property takes the form of mortgages bank railroad and manufacturing stock and bonds All these things escape the eye of the tax assessor and to that extent relatively lighten the burden of the wealthier classes To be continued NOTES AND NEWS THE bacillus of tuberculosis says Nature is often to be found in places lived in by consumptives Herr Prausnitz has lately collected the dust in various compartments of trains which often convey patients from Berlin to Merani and inoculated a number of guineapigs with it Two out of five compartments so exam ined were found to contain the bacillus the dust of one rendered three out of four guineapigs tuberculous that of the other two The animals were killed after ten to twelve weeks but in no case was the disease very advanced the author supposes the number of bacilli to have been but small The facts however seem to point to the necessity of disinfection of such railway carriages especially the carpets or mats Under the will of Dr Fothergill 1821 funds were bequeathed to the Society of Arts London for the offer of medals for subjects in the first instance relating to the prevention of fire The soci ety now offers a gold medal or 20 for the best invention having for its object the prevention or extinction of fires in theatres or other places of public atmusement In cases where the invention is in actual use reference should be made to places where it could be inspected A full description of the invention accompanied by such drawings or models as are necessary for its elucidation must be sent in on or before the 31st of December 1891 to the secretary of the Society of Arts John Street Adelphi London The council reserve the right of withholding the prize in case there is nothing in their opinion deserving the award or sufficiently complying with the conditions sent in for competition VOL XVIII No 448 To the usual wellknown ways of stimulating muscles to contraction viz electrical thermal mechanical and chemical M DArsonval has recently added that by means of light Nature Aug 20 He could not indeed get any contraction in a fresh frogmuscle when he suddenly threw bright light on it in a dark chamber but having first in darkness stimulated a muscle with induction currents too weak to give a visible effect and then sud denly illuminated the muscle with an arc light the muscle showed slight tremnulation Not thinking this conclusive how ever M DArsonval attached a muscle to the middle of a piece of skin stretched on a funnel and connected the tube of the funnel by means of a piece of indiarubber tube with the ear The mus cle being now subjected to intense intermittent light he heard a tone corresponding to the period of illumination and this ceased when the muscle was killed with heat Arc light was used which was concentrated by a lens and passed through an alumsolution to stop the heat rays From a recent issue of Nature we learn that M Raspail has lately called attention in the Zoological Society of France to the serious diminution of birds in that country through destruction of their nests Some insectivorous species are becoming very rare while the ravages of parasites on useful plants are extending Boys of course do a great deal of the mischief and of the vari ous animals which attack nests the squirrel the hedgehog the dormouse the magpie etc M Raspail regards the cat as the worst offender On a recently wooded property of about seven acres he observed last year as follows  Out of thirtyseven nests carefully watched only eight succeeded twentynine were de stroyed fourteen of these by the cat though effort had been made to ward off this insatiable marauder On a large property in the centre of a village the owner had about eighty cats annu ally caught in traps The place having lately changed hands the gardeners estimate that more than one hundred nests were de stroyed last year threefourths of these by cats M Raspail ad vocates a rigorous application of the law for protection of insec tivorous species the disqualification of the cat as a domestic animal and the giving of prizes to foresters and others for de struction of all animals which prey on eggs and young in the nest Tobacco fermentation a very essential process is brought about by firmly packing ripe tobacco in large quantities Nature states that it had been generally supposed that the fermentation is of purely chemical nature but Herr Suchsland of the German Botanical Society finds that a fungus is concerned in it In all the tobaccos he examined he found large quantities of fungi though of only two or three species Bacteriacee were predomi nant but Coccacer also occurred When they were taken and increased by pure cultivation and added to other kinds of to bacco they produced changes of taste and smell which recalled those of their original nutritive base In cultivation of tobacco in Germany it has been sought to get a good quality chiefly by ground cultivation and introduction of the best kinds of tobacco But it is pointed out that failure of the best success may be due to the fact that the more active fermenting fungi of the original country are not brought with the seeds and the ferments here cannot give such good results Experiments made with a view to improvement on the lines suggested have apparently proved successful  Experiments in various methods of seeding wheat have been conducted for a series of years at the Ohio Experiment Station with the following results In the average of four years experi ments wheat covered one inch or less has produced at the rate of thirtyfour bushels per acre that covered two inches has pro duced thirtyfive bushels and that covered three inches thirty four bushels Judging from a smaller number of experiments it does not seem advisable to sow deeper than three inches In the average of six years wheat sown with the rollerpress drill has yielded about eight per cent more than that sown with the ordi nary drill More or less increase has followed the rollerpress in almost every season but a single trial has given results unfavora ble tQ the use of the common roller after seeding Broadcast wheat has this year yielded about the same as that drilled but in

ARE NATURALLY POOR TOGETHER WITH A BOTAN ICAL DEFCRIPTION OF THE PLANT BY DR JAMES GREENI WAY OF DINWIDDIECOUNTY INVIRGINIA READ MAY T N MARYLAND AND ON THE EAFTERNSHORE OF VIR 2A I788 GINIA THEY HAVE LONG BEEN IN THE PRAAFICE OF FOWING A FEED WHICH THEY CALL A BEAN FOR THE FAKE OF RE CRUITING THEIR WORNOUT LANDS AND ENRICHING FUCH AS ARE NATURALLY POOR THE HEFT INFORMATION THAT I HAVE IS THAT THEY FOW A PINT OF THE BEAN WITH EVERY BUFLIEL OF OATS THE OATS RIPEN AND ARE CUT IN JULY AT A TIME WHEN THE YOUNG BEANS ARE FMALL AND EFCAPE THE INJURY OF THE FCYTHE THE BEANS FLOWER IN AUGUFT AND SEPTEMBER IN ODOBER THE LEAVES FALL FF THE FEEDS RIPEN AND THE POD OPENS WITH FUCH CLAFTICITY AS TO FCATTER THE BEANS TO FOME DIFTANCE AR ROUND THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE FIELD IS CULTIVATED WITH CORN THE BEANS WHICH FPROUT EARLY ARE ALL DEFTROYED WITH THE PL5W AND HOE BUT THE MORE NUMEROUS PART NOT MAKING THEIR APPEARANCE ABOVE GROUND UNTIL THE CORN IS LAID BY FPRING UP UNHURT BY THE INFTRUMENTS OF AGRICUL TURE AND FURNIFH FEED FOR THE ENFUING YEAR WHEN THE FIELD IS AGAIN FOWED IN OATS THE GROUND IS ALTERNATELY CUL TIVATED WITH CORN AND OATS ANNUALLY AND IN THE COURFE OF EIGHT OR TEN YEARS FO GREATLY IMPROVED THAT WITHOUT ANY OTHER MANURE THAN THE MOULDERED LEAVES AND FTALKS OF THE BEANS FALLING ON IT THE PRODUCE WILL BE TBREE  BARRELS TO THE ACRE ON FUCH AS PRIOR TO THIS MANAGEMENT WOULD  A BARREL IS A RMEAFURE OF FIVE BUFHELS MUCH USED IN VIRGNREMARIKS ON THE CASSIA C 227 WOULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED MORE THAN ONE THIS IS FAID TO HAPPEN FROM THE QUICK MOULDERING OF THE LEAVES AND FIALKS OF THE BEAN PLANT AND ITS APTITUDE TOMINGLE AND UNITE WITH THE EARTH WITHAUT UNDERGOING A TERMENTATION THUS THE FOIL IS YEARLY AND GRADUALLY ENRICLHED BY THIS FIMPLE AND EAFY PROCEFS OF NATURE WITHOUT THE LABOUIR AND EXPENCE QF ACCUMULATING ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE MATTERS TO UNDER GO THE TEDIOUS OPERATION OF FERMENTATION AND PUTREFADI ON BY WHICH THE DIFFOLUTION OF THOFE FUBIFANCES IS BROUGHT ABOUT AND FILLED FOR MANURE IN THE UFUAL WAY NOT WITHFTANDING THIS EXTRAORDINARY CHARATER OF THE EAFLERN SHOREBEAN I AM CLEARLY OF OPINION THAT OUR COMMON CORNFIELDPEA IS FAR PREFERABLE TO EVERY THING THAT I HAVE FEEN TRIED FOR THIS PURPOFE EVERY FARMER WHO LEAVES HIS PEAVINES ON THE GROUNDW AND DOES NOT IN THE ACCUF TOMED MANNER PULL THEM UP FOR FODDER MUFT OFTEN HAVE OBFERVED THAT THEY QUICKLY MOULDER AND FALL TO PIECES FUR NIFHING A COVERING TO THE GROUND WHICH READILY UNITES AND BLENDS WITH IT IN THE MANNER MENTIONED OF THE BEAN IF A PIECE OF EXHAUFLED LAND FUFFICIENTLY LEVEL TO PREVENT ITS WAFFING AWAY WITH THE RAIN BE ANNUALLY CULTIVATED IA PEAFE LEAVING THE FLALKS AND LEAVES TO MOULDER AND CRUM BLE TO PIECES UPON IT THE GROUND WILL IMPROVE BEYOND EX PEALATION THE CROP OF PEAFE INCREAFING EVERY YEAR AND THE FAIL BECOMING RICHER AN D RICHER WITHOUT ANY OTHER MANURE I WAS TOLD BY AN EMINENT PLANTER THAT POOR GROUND MIGLHT BY THIS MANAGEMENT ALONE BE MADE RICH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE GOOD TOBACCO THEFE HINTS ON THE CULTURE OF THE EAFTERNSHOREBEAN AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE LAND THEREBY ARE RELATED FROM THE BEFT INFORMATION I COULD GET IF ANY GENTLEMEN EX PERIMENTALLY ACQUAINTED WITH IT WOULD FAVOUR THE PUBLIC WITH A MORE AMPLE ACCOUNT IT WILL NO DOUBT BE WELL RE CEIVED AND BE OF UTILITY MY PRINCIPAL DEFIGN IN THIS F F 2 PAPER228 R E M A R K S ON THE PAPER IS TO AFFIFT THE FARMER AS WELL AS THE NATURALIFI BY POINTING OUT THE PLANT AND DEFCRIBING IT FO THAT IT MAY BE DIFFINGUIFHED WITH CERTAINTY FROM ALL OTHERS THE EAFTERNSHOREBEAN  FO CALLED FROM ITS BEING

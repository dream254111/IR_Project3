the parties in which it would be unconscionable to continue to hold the surety to his legal obligation without giving notice No cases have been found to support the decision Where the risk is increased through no act of the obligee the cases go no further than to give a defense when the employee is retained in service after knowledge of his dishonesty Phillips v Foxall L R 7 Q B 666

Contents Observations continued upon the Barometeror Ballance of the Air A Relation concerning the Earthquake neer Oxford together with some Observations of the sealed Weatherglass and Barome ter thereupon by Dr Wallis A more full and particular Account of those Observations about Jupiter that were mentiond in Numb 8 An Account of some Books lately publisht videl Mr Boyles Hydrostatical Paradoxes Steno de Musculis  Gladulis De Graeff de Natura  Usu Succi Pancreatici Observations continued upon the Barometer or rather Ballance of the Air THese Transactions being intended not only to be by parcels brief Records of the Emer gent Works and Productions in the Uni verse Of the Mysteries of Nature of later discoveries And of the growth of Useful Inventions and Arts but also and chiefly to sollicite in all parts mutuall Ayds and Collegiate endeavours for the farther ad vancement thereof We shall begin this Second year of our Pub lications in this kindin whichfor 3moneths the Printingpres ses were interrupted by the publick Calamity with a few more particular Observations upon the Ballance of the Air as they are most happily invented and directed by Mr Boyle and deserve to be prosecuted with care and diligence in all places But it is to be premised that that Worthy person who was alledged as the Author of the Observations delivered of this kind in the last of these Tracts Dr Beale gives notice That Z he164 he did not pretend to exactnessbut only to excite the careful ness of others in the several distant places and chiefly such as can have the assistance of a Wheelballance perfectly filled with out both which aids he hopes not to obtain all the benefits and mysteries of this Invention This being thus briefly intimated the Account of the Ob servations themselves as they were extracted out of a late Let ter of the same Person areas followes 1 As I have fitted and filled the Single Cane I can say in the general That I have not yet found any such infallible Progno stick of these changes of weather which do follow a long sere nityor setled weather And perchance in brighter Climats it may be constantly infallible In these Northern Islands the Clouds are so short and narrow and by fickle changes are sometimes emptied upon ussometimes so neeras may make so little variation in the weight of the whole Atmosphere of Air as may sometimes deceive us or smother and hide from us the causes of fixednessor of changes I wish I could see a good Ca lender or Journal taken in Tangier and in some of our Northern and most Southern parts of America I have store of Hygroscopes of divers kinds and I do remark them and the sweatings of Marble and as many other famed Progno sticksas I can hear offbut can find nothing so neerly indicative of the change of weather as this Ballance Those others are often changed by Dews which do not at all alter the Ballance nor alter the state of the weather And the open Weatherglass is known to signifie nothing at certaintyhaving a double obedience to two Masterssometimes to the Weight of the Airsometimes to Heatas the service is com manded Hygroscopes are Instruments to discover the degrees of Moi sture and Drought of the Air 2 And in further confirmation of this Note I may adde to the former That in January last 16656 from the fourth and more especially from the seventh day for many daies it continued ve ry dark so that all men expected daily great rain yet the Mer cury held very highneer to the greatest height And though in those daies sometimes thick mists arose and some small rain fell yet the Quick silver held at a great height which did indicate to methere could then be no great change of weatherAs the small rain fell it yeilded somewhat not much and that does more con165 confirm the indication And more latelyin very dark daies I had the same confidence upon the same ground and I was not disappointed 3 Again if the Mercury ascends to a good height after the fall of rain as sometimes but less often it does then I look for a setled serenity but if it proceeds after rain in a descending mo tionthen I expect a continuance of broken and showry wea ther But in allas I only sayFor the most partso I dare not posi tively declare it an affirmative result but do refer it to the re marks of othersAnd this may explicate the Notes 6 and 14 of Num 9 into more clearness 4 That we find the Weather and our Bodies more chill cold and drooping when the Mercury is lowest and the Air lightest besides other causes I guess That as Air is to us the breath of lifeas water is to Fishes sowhen we are deprived of the usual measure of this our food tis the same to us as when the water is drawn ebb from Fishes But I would much rather be instructed by othersthen offer much in this kind 5 The lowest descent of the Mercury in all the time since I have observed itwas Octob 26 1665 in the Evening when it was very near at 27 12 Inches Which I find thus circumstanced with the weather in my notes Inch Oct25 Morning Mercury at 2812 Great storms and much rain Oct26 Morning Merc at 28 winds quietthick dark clouds Oct26Evening Merc at 2712 That day and some daies fol lowing the weather was variable frequent rain and as you see the Mercury lowerthan usual 6 Over the place where this Mercurial Cane stands I have set a Wind vane with purpose of exactness of a Streamer in Brass so largeand pointing to a Board indented in the Margin that I can at a sure Level upon the Vane take every of the 32 points of the Wind half points and quarter pointsat good distance Otherwise we may find our guesses much deceived as the best guessers upon trial do acknowledge And this exactness may become the Wheelballance which shews the minutest variations almost beyond imagination And thus any servant at the ap proach of a thick Cloud or other Meteor higher or loweror at the rising of a storm or fresh wind in the nightor daymay bring a report of the Weight of the Air as certainly and almost as Z 2 easily166 easily as of the Sun from the Dial in a Sunshine It were good to have an Index of Winds that discoverd as well their Ascent and Descent as their Sidecoastings

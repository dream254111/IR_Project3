AND I FLATTER MYSELF THAT THE FOLLOWING ANECDOTES WILL NOT BE ALTOGETHER UNACCEPT ABLE TO YOU READ NOV 2 1772 THE SCIENCES WE KNOW ARE SUBJECT TO REVOLUTIONS BUT IS IT NOT A VERY EXTRAORDINARY ONE THAT BOTANY SO USEFUL TO MANKING AND SO WELL KNOWN TO THE AN CIENTS SHOULD FOR SOME AGES ABANDON EUROPE AND REMAIN ALMOST UNKNOWN THERE TILL THE SIXTEENTH CEN TURY WHEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SUDDENLY REVIVED AND HAS SINCE BY THE INDUSTRY OF THE MODERNS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE HIGHEST PERFECTION 1 THE80 THE TRUTH HOWEVER IS THAT BOTANY RETURNED INTO ENGLAND LONG BEFORE THIS AERA IT WAS BROUGHT BACK

EXTANT IN PRINT TO COME TO LATER TIMES THE INGENIOUS MR GOUGH IN HIS BRITISH TOPOGRAPHY P 61 INFORMS US  THAT BEFORE THE YEAR 1597 JOHN GERRARD  CITIZEN AND SURGEON OF LONDON SEEMS TO BE THE  FIRST WHO CULTIVATED A LARGE PHYSIC GARDEN WHICH  HE HAD NEAR HIS HOUSE IN HOLBORN WHERE HE  RAISED 1100 DIFFERENT PLANTS AND TREES HE MIGHT HAVE ADD THAT GERRARD HAD ANOTHER PHYSIC GARDEN IN OLDSTREET CONTAINING A GREAT VARIETY OF PLANTS A PRINTED CATALOGUE OF WHICH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE LIBRARIES OF THE CURIOUS BUT GERRARD HAD A FAMOUS COTEMPORARY WHO GREATLY ADVANCED THAT VALUABLE SCIENCE AND OF WHOM BUT LITTLE HATH HITHERTO BEEN SAID BY THE MODERN BIOGRAPHERS JOHN TRADESCANT IS THE PERSON MEANT AND I HOPE SIR THAT AN ATTEMPT TO REVIVE THE MEMORY OF THIS ONCE EMINENT BOTANIST AND VIRTUOSO WILL NOT BE DISPLEASING JOHN TRADESCANT WAS ACCORDING TO ANTHONY WOOD A FLEMING OR A DUTCHMAN WE ARE INFORMED BY PARKINSON THAT HE HAD TRAVELLED INTO MOST PARTS OF EUROPE AND INTO BARBARY AND FROM SOME EM BLEMS REMAINING UPON HIS MONUMENT IN LAMBETH CHURCHYARD IT PLAINLY APPEARS THAT HE HAD VISITED GREECE EGYPT AND OTHER EASTERN COUNTRIES IN HIS TRAVELS HE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE COLLECTED NOT ONLY PLANTS AND SEEDS BUT MOST OF THOSE CURIO SITIES OF EVERY SORT WHICH AFTER HIS DEATH WERE SOLD BY HIS SON TO THE FAMOUS ELIAS ASHMOLE AND DEPO SITED IN HIS MUSEUM AT OXFORD WHEN83 WHEN HE FIRST SETTLED IN THIS KINGDOM CANNOT AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME BE ASCERTAINED PERHAPS IT WAS TOWARDS THE LATTER END OF THE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZA BETH OR THE BEGINNING OF THAT OF KING JAMES THE FIRST HIS PRINT ENGRAVEN BY HOLLAR BEFORE THE YEAR 1656 WHICH REPRESENTS HIM AS A PERSON VERY FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS SEEMS TO COUNTENANCE THIS OPI NION HE LIVED IN A GREAT HOUSE AT SOUTH LAMBETH WHERE THERE IS REASON TO THINK HIS MUSEUM WAS FRE QUENTLY VISITED BY PERSONS OF RANK WHO BECAME BE NEFACTORS THERETO AMONG THESE WERE KING CHARLES THE FIRST TO WHOM HE WAS GARDENER HENRIETTA MARIA HIS QUEEN ARCHBISHOP LAUD GEORGE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM ROBERT AND WILLIAM CECIL EARLS OF SALISBURY AND MANY OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINC TION F JOHN TRADESCANT MAY THEREFORE BE JUSTLY CONSIDERED AS THE EARLIEST COLLECTOR IN THIS

THIS HOUSE BELONGS AT PRESENT TO JOHN SMALL ESQ WHO ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO PURCHASED IT OF SOME OF ASHMOLES DESCENDANTS AND MY HOUSE ONCE A PART OF TRADESCANTS IS ADJOINING THERETO IT WERE MUCH TO BE WISHED THAT THE LOVERS OF BOTANY HAD VISITED THIS ONCE FAMOUS GARDEN BEFORE OR AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY BUT THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY NEGLECTED TILL THE YEAR 1749 WHEN YOURSELF AND THE LATE DR MITCHEL FAVOURED THE ROYAL SOCIETY I WITH THE ONLY ACCOUNT NOW EXTANT OF THE REMAINS OF TRADESCANTS GARDEN IN IT SIR YOU SEEM TO CONFINE THE EXTENT THEREOF TO 8  JOHN

ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT NUM BER OF PLANTS TREES C AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT TRADESCANTS GARDEN EXTENDED MUCH FARTHER BOUNDED ON THE WEST BY THE ROAD ON THE EAST BY A DEEP DITCH STILL EXTANT IT CERTAINLY EXTENDED A GOOD WAY TOWARDS THE NORTH AND TOOK IN NOT ONLY MY ORCHARD AND GARDEN BUT ALSO THOSE OF TWO OR THREE OF MY NEXT NEIGHBOURS AND SOME ANCIENT MULBERRY TREES PLANTED IN A LINE TOWARDS THE

material changes produced in the brain and the consideration of the time that these might reasonably be sup posed to take in their development Darwin was inclined to believe that ar ticulate speech came at an early period in the history of the sterform of man Ro manes gives a realistic picture of an indi vidual decidedly superior to the anthropoid ape but distinctly below the existing sav ages This hypothetical form half simian half human was according to his sponsor probably erect he had arrived at the power of shaping flints as tools and was a great adept at communicating with his fel lows by gesture vocal tones and facial grimaces With this accomplished ancestor in his mental eye it is not surprising that Ro manes was inclined to consider that artic ulate speech may have come at a later pe riod than is generally supposed At the time that Romanes gave expres sion to these views he was not acquainted with the very marked structural peculiar ities which distinguish the human brain in the region of the speech center I do not refer to the development of the brain in other districts because possibly Romanes might have held that the numerous accom plishments of his speechless ancestor might be sufficient to account for this I merely allude to changes which may reasonably be held to have taken place in direct con nection with the gradual acquisition of speech These structural characters constitute one of the leading peculiarities of the human cerebral cortex and are totally absent in the brain of the anthropoid ape and of the speechless microcephalic idiot Further it is significant that in certain anthropoid brains a slight advance in the same direction may occasionally be faintly 647 traced whilst in certain human brains a distinct backward step is sometimes no ticeable The path which has led to this special development is thus in some meas ure delineated It is certain that these structural addi tions to the human brain are no recent ac quisition by the stemform of man but are the result of a slow evolutionary growtha growth which has been stimulated by the laborious efforts of countless generations to arrive at the perfect coordination of all the muscular factors which are called into play in the production of articulate speech Assuming that the acquisition of speech has afforded the chief stimulus to the gen eral development of the brain and thereby giving it a rank high above any other fac tor which has operated in the evolution of man it would be wrong to lose sight of the fact that the first step in this upward move ment must have been taken by the brain itself Some cerebral variationprobably trifling and insignificant at the start and yet pregnant with the most farreaching pos sibilitieshas in the stemform of man con tributed that condition which has rendered speech possible This variation strength ened and fostered by natural selection has in the end led to the great double result of a large brain with wide and extensive asso ciation areas and articulate speech the two results being brought about by the mutual reaction of the one process upon the other D J CUNNINGHAM PROFESSOR PA WLOWS RESEARCHES ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF SECRETION THE publication last year of the condi tions which are to govern the award of the Nobel prizes was followed not long since by the announcement that Professor J P Pawlow of St Petersburg had been desig nated with Professor Niels R Finsen of Copenhagen as the first recipient of this honor for the most important discovery in OCTOBER 25 1901N S VOL XIV No 356 the department of physiology or of medi cine To those readers of SCIENCE who are not familiar with the details of modern physiological investigation a brief review of the more important work of this brilliant Russian investigator may be of interest Professor Pawlows researches have for the most part been directed to the solution of problems connected with the physiology of secretion His persistent efforts in this field have been crowned with success to an unusual degree and physiology owes to him and his coworkers much of the prog ress which has been made in recent years towards a clearer understanding of the processes of digestion in the animal organ ism New experimental methods have been devised and older ones applied to new purposes With reference to the nitrogenous met abolism of the salivary glands Pawlow showed 1888 by direct chemical analysis that anabolic and katabolic processes are coincident in the secreting organ This observation usually overlooked by physiol ogists was in itself an important contri bution to the theory of secretion The extensive series of experiments on the innervation of the gastric and pancreatic glandsresearches which have had their origin in Pawlows laboratoryhave evoked the widest attention In this study of gastric secretion the improvements in the general technique consisted primarily in the simultaneous introduction of an ordi nary gastric fistula in dogs and a division of the oesophagus in the middle of the neck The cut ends were attached to openings in the neck so that swallowed food passed out at one opening without reaching the stomach and through the other food which it was desired should enter the stomach could be passed in The more important facts ascertained by the use of this method were that when food is eaten a flow of gastric juice is started inasmuch as under the experimental conditions re ferred to the ingested material fails to reach the stomach the reflex character of the im pulses which provoke the secretion can thus be demonstrated The paths along which the reflex stimulation reaches the gastric glands were shown to be the vagus nerves for while section of the splanchnics does not interfere with the reflex secretion this reaction entirely disappears after di vision of the vagi To make the proof complete Pawlow showed that artificial stimulation of the peripheral end of a cut vagus will incite a flow of active gastric juice The possibility of obtaining pure gastric juice uncontaminated with the products of digestion was thus accomplished in a way never before equaled It remained how ever to observe the production of the se cretion and its properties during the course of actual digestion Heidenhain had al ready developed a method of isolating one portion of the stomach from the rest so that it was possible to keep animals in this con dition under observation for a long period In his operations however the nerve sup ply to the isolated portion was undoubtedly seriously interfered with Pawlow im proved the method so that there remained an undisturbed nerve distribution the func tional importance of which he clearly showed Secretion in the isolated portion could thus be followed while digestion was proceeding in the adjoining parts of the stomach Along similar lines our knowledge of the work of the pancreas and the production of the bile has been largely added to by Paw low and his pupils The introduction of a successful method for obtaining permanent fistulas has been followed by a study of the secretory activity of the pancreatic gland The reflex character of the ordinary stimuli has been demonstrated and the paths through which the impulses reach the gland ascertained The existence of inhibitory 648 SCIENCEOCTOBER 25 1901 nerves for the secretory glands has been made more probable byPawlow The true significance of this discovery lies in the fact that it has enabled us to appreciate more clearly the mechanism by which the secre tory glands like other organs adapt them selves so perfectly to the work which they have to accomplish at different times With pure digestive juices made thus readily available it is not surprising to find interest in the study of their composition renewed The way has been opened for more purely chemical investigations such as the recent one of Professor v Nencki a colleague of Professor Pawlowon the character of the enzymes of the gastric juice From the general biological point of view one of the most interesting aspects of the work of the St Petersburg school is the demonstration of the purposeful char acter of secretion into the alimentary canal Quantitatively and qualitatively the work of the glands varies with the character of the substances upon which they exert their action at different times Changes in diet bring variations in the character of secretion Pawlow has broadly expressed this view in summarizing his contributions to our knowledge of the spe cific excitability of the digestive glands He writes  Our results have we trust dispelled from our domain once for all the unfruitful idea that the alimentary canal is excitable by any agent whatsoever me chanical chemical or thermal without re gard to the peculiarity of each specific di gestive task At present agencies such as these vigorously applied must be regarded merely as favoring or inhibitory influences not as the normal and determining factors which excite secretory activity In place of gross uncertainty Scheinwissen we now see the outlines of an artistic mechanism which like everything that we understand in nature exhibits an unusual degree of ex actness and utility in her processes It remains to speak of Pawlows work in cooperation with v Neneki and others on the functions of the liver Here again a brilliant operative techniquethe Eck fis tula by which the portal blood is diverted directly into the vena cava without entering the hepatic capillarieshas inaugurated progress The splendid researches on the seat of urea formation in mammals have modified and shaped the current teaching of this subject and other aspects of interme diary metabolism What light they may throw upon the pathogeny of certain abnor mal states such as uraemia and diabetes can scarcely be foretold Among the comparatively recent contri butions to physiological literature no book has exerted a more stimulating influence than Pawlows  Die Arbeit der Verdauungs driisen J F Bergmann Wiesbaden 1898 It summarizes in suggestive chapters the main achievements of the author in his chosen field of work Its original treat ment of the problems in this domain has aroused the interest of both physiologists and physicians and the work has already served in fulfilment of the authors hope to further physiological science by promot ing a more active interchange of ideas between the practitioner and the laboratory worker Pawlows work has demonstrated what Sir Michael Foster has written in another connection that I the heart of physiology is in the laboratory It is this which sends the lifeblood through its frame and in respect to this perhaps more than anything else has the progress of the past years been striking

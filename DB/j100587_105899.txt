PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CAM BRIDGE H A V I N G LATELY HAD OCCASION IN SOME CHEMICAL ENQUIRIES TO MAKE VARIOUS SOLUTIONS OF SALTS I MET WITH SOME PHAENO MENA WHICH DID NOT APPEAR TO ME EITHER TO HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY ATTENDED TO OR CONSISTENTLY EXPLAINED BY WRITERS UPON THAT SUBJECT THE SUSPENSION OF SALTS IN WATER OF METALS IN ACIDS OF SULPHUR IN OILS AND OF OTHER BODIES IN MENSTRUUMS SPECIFICALLY LIGHTER THAN THE BODIES THEMSELVES HATH EVER BEEN CON SIDERED IN CHEMISTRY AS A PROBLEM OF DIFFICULT SO LUTION THOSE PHILOSOPHERS WHO ACQUIESCE UPON THE WHOLE IN THE CAUSE WHICH HATH BEEN ASSIGNED FOR THIS PHAENOMENON BY SIR ISAAC NEWTON IN HIS OPTICAL QUESTIONS HAVE TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO ILLUSTRATE THE MANNER HOW IT IS EFFECTED BY SUPPOSING THAT THE BODIES ARE RECEIVED INTO THE PORES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MENSTRUUMS AND THERE KEPT SUSPENDED BY THE AT TRACTION OR AS BERNOUILLI AND FREIND WOULD HAVE IT BY THE RESISTANCE ARISING FROM THE TENACITY OF THE FLUID HENCE IT HAPPENS SAY THESE PHILOSOPHERS THAT AFTER READ MAY 24 31 1770326 AFTER WATER IS SATURATED WITH ONE SALT IT IS STILL CAPABLE OF DISSOLVING SOMEWHAT OF A SECOND KIND AND BEING SATURATED WITH THAT OF A THIRD AND SO ON JUST AS A VESSEL FILLED AS FULL AS POSSIBLE WITH SPHERES OR CYLINDERS OF ONE MAGNITUDE HATH A CAPABILITY OF RECEIVING SIMILAR BODIES OF AN INFERIOR SIZE OR BODIES OF A DIFFERENT FIGURE

BETWEEN THE ELEMENTARY PARTICLES OF WATER ARE ENLARGED BY THE EXPANSION OF THE FLUID AND MIGHT THEREFORE BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF ADMITTING INTO THEM A LARGER QUANTITY OF SALT THIS DOCTRINE HATH BEEN EMBRACED BY MOST PHILOSO PHERS ESPECIALLY BY THE LATE ABBE NOLLET IN THE 4TH VOLUME OF HIS LECONS DE PHYSIQUE AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT IT HATH BEEN OPPOSED BY ANY BODY THE LATE327 LATE MR ELLER OF BERLIN HATH CARRIED THIS SPECULATION SO FAR AS TO PUBLISH A TABLE IN THE BERLIN MEMOIRS FOR 1750 EXHIBITING THE SEVERAL QUANTITIES OF ABOVE TWENTY DIFFERENT KINDS OF SALT WHICH A GIVEN QUAN TITY OF WATER WILL ABSORB INTO ITS PORES WITHOUT BEING IN THE LEAST AUGMENTED IN BULK IT IS NOT THEREFORE WITHOUT SOME UNEASINESS THAT I FIND MYSELF CON STRAINED TO DISSENT FROM THE GENERAL OPINION AND PAR TICULARLY TO DIFFER FROM MR ELLER WHO HATH TREATED THIS SUBJECT EX PROFESSO WHO MADE HIS EXPERIMENTS AS HE HIMSELF ASSURES US WITH THE GREATEST EXACTNESS AND WHO WAS LED BY THEM TO THE DISCOVERY OF WHAT HE IS PLEASED TO CALL UNE VERITE INCONTESTABLE SAVOIR QUE LES PLUS PETITES PARTIES CONSTITUANTES DE LEAU SONT DOUEES DE PORES OU DINTERSTICES DANS LESQUELS LES ATOMES DE SEL PEUVENT NICHER SANS AUGMENTER LEUR VOLUME I DO NOT AT PRESENT SEE ANY VERY PROBABLE METHOD OF RECON CILING THE DIFFERENT RESULTS OF OUR ENQUIRIES I WILL THEREFORE CONTENT MYSELF WITH GIVING A PLAIN RELATION OF THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE MADE UPON THIS SUBJECT E X P E R I M E N T I I TOOK A LARGE MATTRASS CONTAINING WHEN FILLED TO THE MIDDLE OF ITS NECK 132 OUNCES OF WATER TROY WEIGHT THE DIAMETER OF THE CAVITY OF THE NECK WAS SIX LINES HAVING WITH A DIAMOND MARKED THE PLACE WHERE THE WATER STOOD IN THE NECK OF THE MATTRASS I DROPPED INTO IT A SINGLE PIECE OF PURIFIED NITRE THE WEIGHT OF WHICH WAS A 2600TH PART OF THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER AND IMMEDIATELY OBSERVED THAT THE WATER WAS CONSIDERABLY ELEVATED IN THE TUBE DURING THE SOLUTION328 SOLUTION OF THE SALT THE WATER SUNK NEAR ONE THIRD OF ITS WHOLE ELEVATION BUT WHEN THE SOLUTION WAS ENTIRELY FINISHED IT REMAINED VERY SENSIBLY RAISED ABOVE THE MARK SO THAT EVEN FROM THE EXPERIMENT WITH THIS INSTRUMENT WE MAY BE ASSURED THAT WATER CAN NOT ABSORB 12 0 0 0TH PART OF ITS WEIGHT OF NITRE WITH OUT BEING AUGMENTED IN BULK MR ELLER FROM HIS EXPERIMENTS CONCLUDES THAT EIGHT OUNCES OF WATER WILL ABSORB ONE DRACHM AND A HALF OR ABOVE A 42D PART OF ITS WEIGHT OF NITRE AND HENCE I SUPPOSED THE QUANTITY OF WATER WHICH I USED WOULD HAVE ABSORBED ABOVE SIXTEEN TIMES AS MUCH OR ABOVE 3 OUNCES WHEREAS THE EVENT SHEWED THAT IT COULD NOT ABSORB 12 0 OF AN OUNCE FROM THE SINKING OF THE WATER DURING THE SOLUTION I WAS AT FIRST INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT SOME PART AT LEAST OF THE NITRE WAS TAKEN INTO THE PORES OF THE WATER IN ORDER TO SEE WHETHER THIS CONJECTURE COULD BE VERIFIED BY FACT I MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT E X P E R I M E N T II I CHOSE TWO MATTRASSES OF UNEQUAL SIZES CONTAIN ING QUANTITIES OF WATER IN THE PROPORTION OF 12 TO 1 THE DIAMETERS OF THE NECKS BEING EQUAL INTO THE LARGEST I PUT 16 5 0TH PART OF THE WATERS WEIGHT OF NITRE AND AN EQUAL QUANTITY INTO THE SMALLER AND I OBSERVED THAT THE WATER AS WELL BEFORE AS AFTER THE SOLUTION WAS EQUALLY ELEVATED IN THEM BOTH THIS EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED NOW IF A GIVEN QUANTITY OF WATER CAN ABSORB INTO ITS PORES WITHOUT BEING IN CREASED IN MAGNITUDE ANY QUANTITY OF SALT HOWEVER SMALL IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT A QUANTITY CONTAINING329 CONTAINING TWELVE TIMES AS MANY PORES SHOULD ABSORB TWELVE TIMES AS MUCH SINCE IT IS AN ALLOWED FACT THAT THE MINUTEST PORTION OF A SALT IS UNIFORMLY DIFFUSED THROUGH THE LARGEST QUANTITY OF WATER AND IT MIGHT CONSEQUENTLY BE EXPECTED THAT THE WATER SHOULD RISE HIGHER IN THE NECK OF THE SMALLER MATRASS THAN IN THAT OF THE LARGER WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE EXPERI MENT E X P E R I M E N T III APPREHENDING THAT COMMON PUMP WATER WITH WHICH I HAD MADE THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS MIGHT HAVE ITS INTERSTICES PREOCCUPIED BY SELENITES AND OTHER HETEROGENEOUS MATTERS AND BE THEREBY RENDERED IN CAPABLE OF ADMITTING INTO THEM ANY ADDITIONAL SUB STANCE AND OBSERVING THAT MR ELLER HAD USED IN ALL HIS EXPERIMENTS 8 OUNCES OF DISTILLED WATER I HAD HOPES TO HAVE RECONCILED MY EXPERIMENTS TO HIS BY THAT MEANS BUT UPON TRIAL WITH DISTILLED WATER I FOUND THE ELEVATION PRECISELY THE SAME AS BEFORE NOR DO THE CONCLUSIONS DEPEND UPON THE KIND OF SALT THEY HOLD TRUE MUTATIS MUTANDIS OF ANY OTHER SALT AS WELL AS NITRE DURING THE SOLUTION THE WATER IS REFRIGERATED AND THEREBY CONTRACTED IN MAGNITUDE AND THE SMALLER THE QUANTITY THE GREATER WILL BE THE COLD AND CONSEQUENT CONTRACTION PRODUCED BY THE AD DITION OF SMALL PORTIONS OF SALT BUT I CANNOT SUP POSE THAT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE COULD BE OVERLOOKED BY MR ELLER THOUGH IT INDUCED ME TO USE A MUCH LARGER QUANTITY OR THAT HE ATTRIBUTED THE SINKING OF THE WATER DURING THE SOLUTION TO AN IMBIBITION OF THE PARTICLES OF THE SEVERAL SALTS INTO THE PORES OF THE VOL LX U U WATER330 WATER AND THENCE BY CALCULATION CONSTRUCTED HIS TABLE E X P E R I M E N T IV HAVING ALWAYS REMARKED THAT THE WATER IN THE NECK OF THE MATRASS WAS ELEVATED HIGHER UPON THE FIRST IMMERSION OF THE SALT THAN AFTER IT WAS WHOLLY DISSOLVED I ENDEAVOURED TO ASCERTAIN THE DIFFERENCE IN SEVERAL KINDS OF SALT TO DO THIS WITH THE GREATER EXACTNESS I PITCHED UPON A MATRASS WHICH HAD A NECK AS FAR AS I WANTED IT ACCURATELY CYLINDRICAL AS I FOUND BY OBSERVING THE ELEVATIONS OCCASIONED BY THE ADDI TIONS OF EQUAL PORTIONS OF WATER THE MATRASS HELD ABOUT 67 OUNCES OF WATER THE SALTS I USED WERE ALL DRY AND IN AS LARGE PIECES AS THE NECK OF THE MA TRASS WOULD ADMIT THE WATER WAS HEATED TO THE FORTY SECOND DEGREE OF FAHRENHEITS THERMOMETER AND KEPT AS NEARLY AS COULD BE IN THAT TEMPERATURE I CHANGED THE WATER

TURBITH MINERAL 9 0 HAD I NOT BEEN IN SOME MEASURE PERSUADED FROM THE RESULT OF THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS THAT NO PORTION OF ANY SALT COULD BE ABSORBED INTO THE PORES OF WA TER I SHOULD HAVE READILY CONCLUDED THAT THE THIRD COLUMN OF THIS TABLE DENOTED SUCH PARTS OF 24 PENNY WEIGHTS OF THE SEVERAL SALTS AS MIGHT BE LODGED IN THE INTERSTICES OF 67 OUNCES OF WATER WITHOUT INCREASING ITS MAGNITUDE THE QUANTITIES INDEED WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN THUS ASCERTAINED WOULD HAVE BUT ILL AGREED WITH THOSE WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY MR ELLER AND U U 2 THAT332 THAT DIVERSITY OF QUANTITY MAY SUGGEST A DOUBT CON CERNING THE VALIDITY OF HIS PRINCIPLE THE SINKING OF THE WATER IN THE NECK OF THE MATRASS SEEMS TO BE A GENERAL PHAENOMENON ATTENDING THE SOLUTION OF ALL SALTS THE QUANTITY OF THE DESCENT IS VARIOUS FROM 14 0 TO 12 OF THE WHOLE ELEVATION IN THOSE SALTS WHICH I HAVE TRIED IN FORMING THE TABLE I REPEATED MANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS BUT FOUND NO VARIATION WHICH COULD AFFECT THE GENERAL CONCLUSION WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION I REPEATED THE SOLUTION OF VITRIOLATED TARTAR FOR I THOUGHT IT A VERY REMARKABLE CITCUMSTANCE THAT ONE OF THE HARDEST SALTS SHOULD BE MORE DIMINISHED IN PROPORTION TO ITS WHOLE BULK THAN ANY OTHER BUT THE NUMBERS IN THE TABLE 22 AND 11 ACCURATELY EX PRESSED THE HEIGHT BEFORE AND AFTER SOLUTION UPON THE REPETITION OF THE EXPERIMENT SO THAT IT MAY BE RELIED UPON AS A CERTAIN FACT THAT A CUBIC INCH OF VITRIOLATED TARTAR IS BY SOLUTION IN WATER REDUCED TO HALF A CUBIC INCH THOUGH THE WATER CANNOT AS APPEARED FROM AN EXPERIMENT I MADE ABSORB 11 0 0 0TH PART NOR AS I BELIEVE ANY PART OF THAT SALT WITHOUT BEING AUGMENT ED IN MAGNITUDE IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE TABLE THAT SAL GEMMAE BLUE VITRIOL CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE CALCINED VITRIOL AND IN GENERAL THOSE SALTS WHICH RETAIN THE LEAST WATER IN THEIR COMPOSITION AND CONSTITUTE THE HARDEST MASSES SINK MORE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BULKS THAN ANY OTHER I OWN MYSELF AT A LOSS FOR A GENERAL PRINCIPLE TO EXPLAIN THIS GENERAL PHAENOMENON UNLESS THE AIR CONTAINED IN THE SEVERAL SALTS MAY BE ESTEEMED SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE A VERY COPIOUS SEPARATION OF AIR FROM THE SALTS DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF THEIR SOLUTION MAY BE READILY OBSERVED IN ALL OF THEM AND A SMALL PORTION OF IT COMBINED WITH THE333 THE PARTICLES OF A SALT MAY AUGMENT ITS BULK WITH OUT SENSIBLY INCREASING ITS WEIGHT YET THE TWO FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS RATHER TEND TO DIMINISH THE PROBABILITY OF THIS OPINION E X P E R I M E N T V I TOOK WATER WHICH HAD BEEN WELL PURGED FROM ITS AIR BY LONG BOILING AND WHICH HAD BEEN CORKED UP WHILST IT WAS WARM WHEN IT HAD ACQUIRED A PROPER TEMPERATURE I FILLED A MATRASS WITH IT AS BEFORE AND PUTTING INTO IT SAL GEMMAE C I OBSERVED THAT THE ELEVATION BEFORE SOLUTION WAS THE SAME AS WHEN COM MON WATER WAS USED AND THAT IT SUNK EQUALLY IN THE NECK DURING THE SOLUTION BUT THEN THE SEPARATION OF AIR SEEMED GREATLY LESS IN ALL THE TRIALS I MADE THIS PHAENOMENON IS EASILY EXPLAINED COMMON WATER IS ALWAYS SATURATED WITH AIR UPON THE ADDITION OF ANY SALT THE PARTICLES OF WATER BEGIN TO ATTRACT AND DISSOLVE THE SALT AND LET GO THE AIR WITH WHICH THEY ARE UNITED THIS AIR ADDED TO THE AIR CONTAINED IN THE SALT RENDERS THE WHOLE MUCH MORE VISIBLE IN COMMON THAN IN BOILED WATER MUSSCHENBROOK AND OTHERS ARE OF OPINION THAT AIR ONLY FILLS THE INTERSTICES OF WATER WITHOUT AUGMENTING ITS BULK THEY GROUND THEIR OPINION UPON OBSERVING THAT THE SPECIFIC GRAVI TIES OF COMMON WATER AND OF WATER PURGED FROM ITS AIR ARE EQUAL THE FACT TAKING IT FOR GRANTED WILL SCARCELY AUTHORIZE THE CONCLUSION FOR SUPPOSING THAT A CUBIC INCH OF COMMON WATER CONTAINS EVEN A CUBIC INCH OF AIR THE DIFFERENCE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER WHEN SATURATED WITH AIR AND WHEN FREED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM IT THOUGH PROBABLY IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY334 WHOLLY FREED FROM IT WILL NOT EQUAL 14 OF A GRAIN HOW IMPERCEPTIBLE THEN MUST THE DIFFERENCE BE IF WATER INSTEAD OF AN EQUAL BULK DOTH NOT CONTAIN 11 0 0TH PART OF ITS BULK OF AIR WHICH IS A SUPPOSITION MUCH NEARER TO THE TRUTH THE AIR IS SEPARATED FROM THE WATER DURING THE SOLUTION OF THE SALT AND THE PARTICLES OF THE SALT PROBABLY OCCUPY ITS PLACE AS HAPPENS IN OTHER CHEMICAL PRECIPITATIONS BUT WE CANNOT THENCE INFER THAT THEY ARE RECEIVED INTO THE INTERSTICES OF THE WATER UNLESS WE HAD MORE CON CLUSIVE ARGUMENTS TO PROVE THAT THE AIR ITSELF WAS LODGED IN THEM I VARIED THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENT BY PUTTING TWO EQUAL AND TRANSPARENT PIECES OF SAL GEMMAE INTO TWO TALL DRINKING GLASSES FILLED ONE WITH COMMON THE OTHER WITH BOILED WATER FROM THE FIRST THERE CONTINUALLY ASCENDED A VERY VISIBLE STREAM OF AIR AND THE SALT AND THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS WERE COVERED WITH BUBBLES IT SEEMING AS IF THE WATER QUITTED ITS AIR TO DISSOLVE THE SALT IN THE OTHER THOUGH SOME AIR WAS SEEN BREAKING OUT FROM THE SALT WHILST IT WAS DISSOLVING THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANY PRECIPI TATED AS IT WERE FROM THE WATER IN MOST OF THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I MADE THE BOILED WATER DISSOLVED A GIVEN QUANTITY OF SALT SOONER THAN THE COMMON WATER WHEN THEY HAD THE SAME DEGREE OF HEAT BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME MIGHT BE OWING TO THE DIFFERENT MAGNITUDE OF THE SURFACES OF THE SALT THOUGH FROM THE GENERALITY OF THE EVENT I SHOULD RATHER ATTRIBUTE IT TO THE DIFFERENT DISSOLVING POWERS OF WATER WHEN REPLETE WITH AND WHEN DEPRIVED OF AIR E X P E R I335 E X P E R I M E N T VI THINKING THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BULKS OF THE WATER BEFORE AND AFTER SOLUTION MIGHT BE OWING TO THE SEPARATION AND ESCAPE OF SOME VOLATILE PRINCIPLE I TOOK CARE TO BALANCE AS ACCURATELY AS I COULD WATER AND SAL GEMMAE WATER AND SALT OF TARTAR WATER AND VITRIOLATED TARTAR C AND THEN PUTTING THE SEVERAL SALTS INTO THE WATER I OBSERVED WHEN THE SOLUTION WAS ACCOMPLISHED WHETHER THE EQUILIBRIUM OF THE SCALES WAS AFFECTED BUT I COULD NOT DISTINGUISH ANY CHANGE DR HALES AND OTHERS HAVE SPOKEN OF THE EXISTENCE OF AIR IN SALTS AND HAVE IN TWO OR THREE INSTANCES INVESTIGATED THE QUANTITY BUT AFTER A VERY DIFFERENT MANNER FROM THAT I HAVE USED NOR CAN I THINK MYSELF AT LIBERTY TO ESTEEM THIS AIR WHICH IS SEPARATED BY SOLUTION OF THE SAME NATURE WITH THAT WHICH IS CALLED BY HIM AND OTHERS FIXED AIR INASMUCH AS FIXED AIR MAKES A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE WEIGHT OF THE BODIES FROM WHICH IT IS EXTRACTED PRECIPITATES LIME WATER AND IS SELDOM DISCHARGED OR PERHAPS PRO DUCED FROM SOME OF THE MINUTE PARTS OF THE BODY BEING CONVERTED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE FIRE C INTO AN ELASTIC FLUID EXCEPT WHEN THE BODY IS DECOM POSED WHEREAS THIS MAKES ONLY A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE BULK OF BODIES AND THUS DIMINISHES THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY WITHOUT SENSIBLY INCREASING THEIR AB SOLUTE WEIGHT DOES NOT AS I COLLECTED FROM SOME ROUGH TRIALS RENDER LIME WATER TURBID AND IS SET AT LIBERTY THOUGH NOT BY A MECHANICAL DIVISION YET BY AN OPERATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM CHEMICAL DE COMPOSITION IT HATH BEEN REMARKED BY SOME THAT SALINE336 SALINE SOLUTIONS WILL NOT CRYSTALLIZE WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY IN AN EXHAUSTED RECEIVER PERHAPS BECAUSE THE PARTICLES OF SALT CANNOT ATTRACT THAT PRINCIPLE WHICH SHOULD CEMENT THEM TOGETHER WHICH AT LEAST MAY BE SEEN ESCAPING FROM THEM WHEN THEY BEGIN TO BE SEPARATED MR BOYLE OBSERVED THAT AQUAFORTIS POURED UPON A STRONG VEGETABLE ALCALI DID NOT CRY STALLIZE TILL IT HAD BEEN LONG EXPOSED TO THE AIR THOUGH I SHOULD RATHER ATTRIBUTE THIS FAILURE TO THE WEAKNESS OF HIS AQUAFORTIS THAN TO THE WANT OF AIR SINCE I HAVE FREQUENTLY BY USING THE FUMING SPIRIT OF NITRE OBTAIN ED CRYSTALS OF AN INCH IN LENGTH ALMOST INSTANTANE OUSLY AND SEVERAL OTHER PHAENOMENA MIGHT BE AD DUCED RESPECTING THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF SALTS WHICH SEEM TO INDICATE THE NECESSITY OF ADMITTING AIR AS A VERY EFFICACIOUS INSTRUMENT IN PRODUCING THAT EFFECT BUT FUTURE EXPERIENCE MAY TEND TO ELUCIDATE THIS MATTER HAVING USED GREAT ATTENTION IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENTS FROM WHICH THE PRECEDING TABLE WAS COMPOSED I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD OPPORTUNITY OF DERIVING FROM IT THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF THE SALTS WHICH ARE THERE MENTIONED I ACCORDINGLY CALCULATED THE FOLLOWING TABLE IN THE FIRST COLUMN OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSED THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES AS CALCULATED FROM THE INCREASE OF BULK BEFORE SOLUTION IN THE SECOND

THAN WHAT ARE ASSIGNED TO THESE BODIES BY SOME AUTHORS AND LESS THAN WHAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BY OTHERS IT SEEMS AS IF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF SALINE BODIES MIGHT IN A PROPER VESSEL BE MORE ACCURATELY ASCERTAINED FROM THE OBSERVED INCREASE OF THE WATERS BULK THAN ANY OTHER WAY UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE ESCAPE OF THE AIR IS THE REASON OF VOL LX X X THE338 THE WATERS SINKING DURING THE SOLUTION AND THAT THIS AIR CONTRIBUTES LITTLE TO THE WEIGHT OF THE SALTS THOUGH IT MAY BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THE EXHIBITING THE SALINE MOLECULAE UNDER A VISIBLE CRYSTALLINE APPEARANCE THE SECOND COLUMN WILL DENOTE THE REAL SPECIFIC GRA VITIES OF THE SALTS AS FREED FROM AIR THAT THIS AIR IS COMBINED WITH THE SALTS AND DOTH NOT SIMPLY ADHERE TO THEIR SURFACES MAY APPEAR FROM HENCE THAT THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES AS CALCULATED FROM THE INCREASE OF BULK OBSERVED IN THE WATER BEFORE SOLUTION SUFFICIENTLY CORRESPOND WITH THOSE WHICH PHILOSOPHERS HAVE DETER MINED HYDROSTATICALLY NOR INDEED UPON EXHAUSTING THE AIR FROM THE SALTS BY AN AIR PUMP COULD I OBSERVE THAT IT WAS SEPARATED IN LESS QUANTITY DURING SO LUTION E X P E R I M E N T VII SINCE EQUAL QUANTITIES OF SALT MUST CONTAIN EQUAL QUANTITIES OF AIR IT MIGHT BE EXPECTED A PRIORI IF THE ESCAPE OF THE AIR WAS THE OCCASION OF THE WATERS SINKING THAT EQUAL WEIGHTS OF SALT WOULD PRODUCE EQUAL AUGMENTATIONS OF BULK AND UNEQUAL WEIGHTS AUGMENTATIONS PROPORTIONABLE TO THEIR WEIGHTS BUT TO BE ASSURED OF THIS I TOOK A MATRASS CONTAINING ABOUT 30 OUNCES OF WATER THE TUBE BEING CYLINDRICAL FOR ABOUT 7 INCHES IN LENGTH WHEN THE MATRASS WAS FILLED TO A PROPER MARK I PUT INTO IT 7 PENNY WEIGHTS OF POWDERED SAL GEM THE WATER AFTER THE SOLUTION HAD RISEN THROUGH 17 TENTHS OF AN INCH BY THE ADDITION OF 14 PENNYWEIGHTS MORE THE WATER WAS RAISED THROUGH 51 DIVISIONS FROM THE FIRST MARK OR TWICE 17 FROM WHERE IT STOOD AFTER THE SOLUTION OF 7 PENNY339 7 PENNYWEIGHTS IN THE SAME MATRASS I TRIED A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT WITH NITRE THE WATER WAS RAISED THROUGH 10 DIVISIONS BY 3 PENNYWEIGHTS OF POWDERED NITRE AND BY 18 MORE IT STOOD AFTER THE SOLUTION AT THE 70TH DIVISION FROM THE FIRST MARK AND CONSE QUENTLY ROSE THROUGH SIX TIMES THE SPACE THROUGH WHICH IT HAD BEEN RAISED BY 3 PENNYWEIGHTS FROM THESE AND OTHER EXPERIMENTS OF THE SAME KIND I AM DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT EQUAL PORTIONS OF SALT PRODUCE EQUAL AUGMENTATIONS IN THE BULK OF THE WATER WHEREIN THEY ARE DISSOLVED AT LEAST THIS HOLDS TRUE WHEN THE SALT DISSOLVED BEARS BUT A SMALL PROPORTION TO WHAT WOULD BE REQUISITE TO SATURATE THE WATER BUT IN MAKING THIS EXPERIMENT GREAT CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO KEEP THE SALTS OF THE SAME DRYNESS I HAD ONCE TRIED IT WITH THREE EQUAL QUANTITIES OF SEA SALT AND ARRIVED AT A QUITE DIFFERENT CONCLUSION THE INCREASES OF BULK OCCASIONED BY THE SOLUTION OF THE SEVERAL SALTS BEING SEPARATELY TAKEN AS 15 16 17 BUT THE SALT BEING MUCH DRIER THAN THE AIR IN THE LABORATORY HAD UN DOUBTEDLY ATTRACTED THE HUMIDITY AND THAT PORTION HAD ATTRACTED THE MOST WHICH HAD BEEN THE LONGEST IN IT AND WHICH WAS LAST DISSOLVED NOR SHOULD THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER BE NEGLECTED A SENSIBLE ERROR MAY PROCEED FROM A MINUTE CHANGE IN THAT THIS EXPERIMENT CONFIRMS THE FIRST FOR WAS ANY PART OF SALT ABSORBED INTO THE PORES OF THE WATER IT CER TAINLY OUGHT TO BE EXPECTED THAT THE ELEVATION OC CASIONED BY THE SOLUTION OF 3 PENNYWEIGHTS OF NITRE SHOULD BE LESS THAN 16TH OF THAT OCCASIONED BY 18 PENNYWEIGHTS AND YET I FOUND IT TO BE ACCURATELY 16TH UPON REPEATING THE EXPERIMENT WITH DISTILLED WATER IT CONFIRMS IT TOO IN ANOTHER VIEW 3 PENNY X X 2 WEIGHTS340 WEIGHTS OR 1200TH PART OF THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER RAISED IT THROUGH ONE INCH HENCE 12000TH PART WOULD HAVE RAISED IT THROUGH ONE TENTH OF AN INCH WHICH ANY EYE MAY DISTINGUISH DR LEWIS FOR WHOSE GREAT ABILITIES IN CHEMISTRY I HAVE A VERY HIGH RESPECT IN HIS LITTLE TREATISE UPON AMERICAN POTASHES IS OF OPINION THAT THE AUGMEN TATION OF THE BULK OF WATER DOTH NOT PROCEED UNI FORMLY ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITY OF SALT ADDED AND HE FORMS HIS CONCLUSION FROM OBSERVING THAT THE LOSSES OF WEIGHT SUSTAINED BY THE SAME BODY IN DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS WERE NOT UNIFORM BUT CONTINUALLY DIMI NISHED THE LOSSES CORRESPONDING TO SEVEN SUCCESSIVE EQUAL QUANTITIES BEING AS 2412 24 2312 22 22 21 20 UPON CONSIDERING THIS MATTER IN A MATHEMATICAL LIGHT I AN INCLINED TO DRAW A QUITE DIFFERENT CONCLU SION BUT I WILL FIRST MENTION SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAD FORMERLY MADE WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW AND WHICH AGREE VERY WELL WITH DR LEWISS E X P E R I M E N T VIII I HAD CONCEIVED THAT IF IN A GIVEN QUANTITY OF WATER SEVERAL QUANTITIES OF SALT INCREASING IN ANY ARITHMETICAL OR GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION WERE DISSOLVED THAT THE INCREMENTS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY WOULD INCREASE IN THE SAME PROGRESSION IN ORDER TO SEE WHETHER THIS CONJECTURE COULD BE ESTABLISHED BY EXPERIMENT I DIS SOLVED IN A GIVEN QUANTITY OF WATER DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF SEA SALT INCREASING IN THE PROGRESSIONS EXPRESSED IN THE ANNEXED TABLES WHERE THE FIRST COLUMN OF EACH DENOTES THE PROPORTIONAL QUANTITIES OF SALT IN PENNY WEIGHTS THE SECOND THE LOSS OF WEIGHT OF A GIVEN 5 BODY341 BODY IN QUARTER GRAINS THE THIRD

DIFFERENCE OF THE NUMBERS IN THE THIRD CO LUMN OF EACH TABLE FROM ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSIONS IS OBVIOUS AT FIRST VIEW THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TWO LAST NUMBERS OF EACH BEING CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIRST AND THE NUMBERS 6 11 22 41 CORRESPONDING TO THE GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION 5 10 20 40 IN THE SECOND TABLE AS WELL AS THE NUMBERS 16 32 62 113 CORRESPONDING TO THE GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION 4 8 16 32 IN THE THIRD DIFFER CONSIDERABLY FROM GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSIONS WHOSE COMMON RATIO IS 12 IN MAKING THESE EXPERIMENTS THERE ARE THREE OBVI OUS SOURCES OF ERROR THE HEAT MAY NOT REMAIN CON STANT THE ADDITIONAL WEIGHTS OF SALT MAY NOT BE AC CURATELY EQUAL AND THE WEIGHT OF THE GIVEN BODY MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN WHAT IS EXPRESSED BY ANY QUANTITY342 QUANTITY LESS THAN 14 OF A GRAIN YET THE DIFFERENCES OF THE PRECEDING NUMBERS FROM ARITHMETICAL OR GEOME TRICAL PROGRESSIONS ARE TOO GREAT TO BE EXPLAINED FROM ANY OR ALL OF THESE SOURCES TAKEN TOGETHER WE MAY OBSERVE THAT THE LOSSES OF WEIGHT CORRESPONDING TO EQUAL PORTIONS OF SALT ARE UPON THE WHOLE DI MINISHED BUT IT WILL NOT FOLLOW FROM THENCE THAT THE BULKS ARE NOT EQUALLY AUGMENTED FOR SINCE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF EVERY BODY IS PROPERLY DENOTED BY A FRACTION WHOSE NUMERATOR EXPRESSES THE ABSOLUTE WEIGHT AND DENOMINATOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE BODY LET WM WXMY W2XMZ W3XMS C BE A SERIES OF FRACTIONS WHOSE SEVERAL NUMERATORS EXPRESS THE WEIGHTS OF A GIVEN QUANTITY OF WATER AS INCREASED BY THE ADDITION OF EQUAL PORTIONS OF ANY SALT DENOTED BY X AND WHOSE DENOMINATORS EXPRESS THE BULKS OF THE WATER AFTER THE SOLUTION OF EACH PORTION OF SALT THE INCREMENTS OF BULK BEING DENOTED BY Y Z S NOW LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE LOSSES OF WEIGHT SUSTAINED BY THE SAME BODY THAT IS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES INCREASE UNIFORMLY THEN WILL THE ABOVE SERIES OF FRACTIONS INCREASE UNIFORMLY LET WM  A WXMY  AB W2XMZ  A2B W3XMS  A  3 B FROM THESE EQUATIONS INVESTIGATING THE PROPORTION BETWEEN Y Z S WHICH REPRESENT THE

HAVE BEEN HAD THE DENOMINATORS OR THE BULKS OF THE FLUID IN CREASED343 CREASED UNIFORMLY WHEN THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OR AB SOLUTE WEIGHTS INCREASED UNIFORMLY WE SEE FROM THIS WHAT CONCLUSION SHOULD HAVE BEEN FORMED HAD THE INCREMENTS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY FROM EQUAL PORTIONS OF SALT BEEN EQUAL AGAIN SUPPOSE THAT WM WPMQ W2PM2Q W3PM3Q C DENOTE A SERIES OF FRACTIONS WHOSE NUMERATORS EXPRESSING THE WEIGHTS OF A GIVEN QUAN TITY OF WATER AS INCREASED BY THE ADDITION OF SALT AND WHOSE DENOMINATORS EXPRESSING THE BULKS BOTH IN CREASE UNIFORMLY THEN WILL THE SEVERAL DIFFERENCES BE TWEEN THE 2D AND 1ST BETWEEN THE 3D AND 2D AND SO ON BE AS 1MXMQ 1MQXM2Q 1M2QXM3Q 1M3QXM4Q C WHICH FRACTIONS BEING INVERSELY AS THEIR DENOMINATORS CONSTITUTE A DECREASING SERIES BUT THE INCREMENTS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY FROM THE ADDITION OF EQUAL PORTIONS OF SALT ARE PROPORTIONABLE TO THESE FRACTIONS AND THEREFORE OUGHT PERPETUALLY TO DECREASE THOUGH WE ALLOWED THE BULK OF THE COM POUND TO BE PRECISELY EQUAL TO THE BULK OF THE WATER AND SALT TAKEN TOGETHER THAT IS THOUGH WE ALLOWED THE BULK OF THE WATER TO INCREASE UNIFORMLY ACCORD ING TO THE QUANTITY OF SALT ADDED NOW AS IT IS EVIDENT FROM DR LEWISS EXPERIMENTS AND FROM EACH OF THE PRECEDING TABLES THAT THE INCREMENTS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY DO DECREASE UPON THE WHOLE WHEN THE ABSOLUTE WEIGHTS INCREASE UNIFORMLY WE MAY VENTURE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE BULKS INCREASE UNIFORMLY ALSO I THOUGHT PROPER TO EXPLAIN THE FOREGOING PRINCIPLE AND TO DETERMINE THE RATIO BECAUSE THE MATTER344 MATTER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN BY MANY HOW EVER IT MAY BE EASILY APPREHENDED THAT THE INCREMENTS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY FROM THE ADDITION OF EQUAL QUAN TITIES OF SALT TO A GIVEN WEIGHT OF WATER OUGHT PER PETUALLY TO DECREASE BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF THE WATER AND OF THE SALT PERPETUALLY DECREASES AS THE WATER APPROACHES TO PERFECT SATURATION IN LIKE MANNER IF TO A GIVEN QUANTITY OF WATER WE ADD ANY NUMBER OF EQUAL QUANTITIES OF OIL OF VITRIOL OR ANY FLUID MISCIBLE WITH AND HEAVIER THAN WATER THE INCREMENTS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY WILL PERPETUALLY DECREASE THOUGH THEY WILL NEVER ENTIRELY VANISH BECAUSE THERE IS A PERPETUAL APPROXIMATION TO THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE ACID WHICH YET THE MIXTURE CAN NEVER ACQUIRE AND VICE VERSA IF TO WATER WE ADD A LIGHTER FLUID AS SPIRITS OF WINE BY EQUAL PORTIONS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE MIXTURE WILL CONSTANTLY DECREASE BY UNEQUAL DECRE MENTS BUT THE DECREMENTS WILL NEVER VANISH BECAUSE THE MIXTURE MUST EVER REMAIN SPECIFICALLY HEAVIER THAN SPIRIT OF WINE E X P E R I M E N T IX THE QUANTITIES OF VARIOUS SALTS WHICH MAY BE DISSOLVED IN A GIVEN QUANTITY OF WATER HAVE BEEN ASCERTAINED BY BOERHAAVE ELLER SPIELMAN AND OTHERS THEIR ACCOUNTS DIFFER SOMEWHAT FROM ONE ANOTHER AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OF THE AIR THE DIFFERENT STATE OF THEIR SALTS THE DIFFERENT TIMES A CIRCUMSTANCE OF NO SMALL CONSIDERATION IN THIS MATTER WHICH THEY ALLOWED THE WATER TO ACT UPON THE SALTS BEFORE THEY CONCLUDED IT TO345 TO BE FULLY SATURATED AND FROM SOME OTHER CIRCUM STANCES WHICH MIGHT PERHAPS WITH ADVANTAGE BE TAKEN INTO THE ACCOUNT AND A MORE ACCURATE TABLE COMPOSED THAN HATH HITHERTO BEEN PUBLISHED BUT AS THE DIFFER ENCES WOULD BE SMALL AND MIGHT NOT TEND TO ANY NEW DISCOVERIES I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO BE AT THE TROUBLE OF MAKING THE REQUISITE EXPERIMENTS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A MORE USEFUL UNDERTAKING TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF SATURATED SOLUTIONS OF VARIOUS SALTS IN COMPOSING THE FOLLOWING TABLE I USED EVERY POSSIBLE PRECAUTION THE SOLUTIONS WERE FULLY SATURATED BY PERMITTING THE WATER TO REST UPON THE SALTS FOR SOME WEEKS AND FREQUENTLY SHAKING THE SOLUTIONS DURING THE INTERVAL I HAD SOME REASONS FOR CHUSING THIS METHOD RATHER THAN THE MUCH SHORTER ONE OF DISSOLVING THE SALTS IN HOT WATER AND LETTING THE SOLUTIONS COOL THOUGH THE EVENT WILL BE MUCH THE SAME IN BOTH WAYS MY BALANCE WAS EXTREMELY SENSIBLE THOUGH I DID NOT USE ANY WEIGHT LESS THAN A QUARTER OF A GRAIN THE WATER IN WHICH THE SALTS WERE DISSOLVED WAS NOT 14 OF A GRAIN IN 890 HEAVIER THAN DISTILLED WATER THE SOLUTIONS WERE ALL OF THE SAME TEMPERATURE FAHRENHEITS

HEAT INCREASES OR DECREASES IN ANY KNOWN RATIO IT IS EXTREMELY PROBABLE THAT THE LAW ACCORD ING TO WHICH THE DISSOLVING POWER OF WATER VARIES WITH THE VARIATION OF ITS HEAT MIGHT BE INVESTIGATED I HAVE SOME REASONS FOR THINKING THAT THOUGH IT IN CREASES WITH THE INCREASE OF HEAT YET IT DOTH NOT INCREASE IN THE DIRECT SIMPLE RATIO OF THE HEAT BUT WHAT THE LAW IS OR WHETHER ALL SALTS FOLLOW THE SAME LAW I CANNOT FROM ANY EXPERIMENTS I HAVE ALREADY MADE DETERMINE AND I HAVE NO LEISURE AT PRESENT TO PROSECUTE THE ENQUIRY THE CONCLUSION WILL BE UN AVOIDABLY LIABLE TO A SMALL INACCURACY FOR WHETHER THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES BE INVESTIGATED BY WEIGHING THE SEVERAL FLUIDS IN A GIVEN VESSEL FILLED TO A GIVEN MARK OR BY WEIGHING A GIVEN SOLID IN EACH OF THEM WE SHALL NOT THENCE OBTAIN THE WEIGHTS OF EQUAL BULKS SINCE THE CONTAINING VESSEL OR THE SOLID FROM THE DIFFERENCE OF THE HEATS HAVE A DIFFERENT CAPACITY OR A DIFFERENT BULK HOWEVER IT IS NOT APPREHENDED THAT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD SENSIBLY AFFECT THE CONCLU SION ESPECIALLY AS IT IS SUBJECT TO CALCULATION AND MIGHT347 MIGHT BE ALLOWED FOR IT OUGHT AT THE SAME TIME TO BE OBSERVED THAT A GIVEN BULK OF THE WATER WITH WHICH THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES ARE COMPOSED WILL HAVE DIFFERENT WEIGHTS WHEN THE HEATS ARE DIFFERENT AND THESE DIFFERENCES OUGHT FIRST TO BE ASCERTAINED E X P E R I M E N T X HAVING THUS DETERMINED THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF SATURATED SOLUTIONS OF SEVERAL SALTS IN A GIVEN DEGREE OF HEAT MY NEXT ENQUIRY WAS TO FIND THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF WATER IMPREGNATED WITH A GIVEN QUANTITY OF THE SEVERAL SALTS

CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE AND A GREAT MANY OTHER SALTS HOWEVER AS SUCH A TABLE CAN NOT FAIL OF BEING USEFUL IN CHEMICAL AND PERHAPS MEDICAL RESEARCHES IT WOULD BE WORTH WHILE TO MAKE IT MORE GENERAL EITHER BY DISSOLVING A LESS PORTION OF SALT OR MAKING USE OF A GREATER DEGREE OF HEAT E X P E R I M E N T XI TO THESE TABLES I HAVE SUBJOINED ANOTHER OF A DIFFERENT NATURE WHEREIN THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF WATER IMPREGNATED WITH DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF THE SAME SALT FROM 13 DOWN TO THE 1024TH PART OF THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER ARE DETERMINED I CANNOT ACCUSE MYSELF OF CARELESSNESS IN MAKING ANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS FROM WHICH THE TABLE IS FORMED BUT PART OF IT BEING MADE IN A ROOM WHERE THE HEAT WAS ABOUT 55 AND THE OTHER IN MY LABORATORY WHEN IT DID NOT EXCEED 46 A CERTAIN INACCURACY THOUGH IT WILL BE A VERY SMALL ONE AND SCARCE SENSIBLE IN THE WEIGHT OF THE SMALL BODY WHICH I USED WILL ATTEND IT UPON THAT ACCOUNT THE SALT WAS SEA SALT OF THE FINEST KIND AND EXTREMELY DRY MANY OF THE EXPERI

INCREASED BY THE SOLUTION OF A GIVEN QUANTITY OF SALT AND VICE VERSA IF WE KNOW THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF ANY SOLUTION OF SALT WE MAY FORM A GOOD CONJECTURE OF THE QUANTITY OF SALT CONTAINED IN IT WHICH OBSERVATION MAY BE OF READY USE IN ESTIMATING THE STRENGTH OF BRINE SPRINGS AND OF SEA WATER TAKEN UP IN DIFFERENT CLIMATES OR UPON DIFFERENT COASTS IN THE SAME CLIMATE THUS IF A SALT SPRING OR SEA WATER SHOULD WEIGH 150 MORE BULK FOR BULK THAN COMMON WATER WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IT CONTAINS 136 OF ITS WEIGHT OF SALT IF 140 IT HATH NEARLY 128 IF 125 118 IF 120 114 AND SO ON WE MAY ALWAYS FIND LIMITS NEAR ENOUGH TO FORM A CONCLUSION FROM THOUGH THE EXACT NUMBER DENOTING THE WEIGHT IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE SHOULD NOT BE MET WITH IN THE TABLE AFTER I HAD DRAWN UP THE PRECEDING ACCOUNT OF THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAD MADE I RECEIVED THE BERLIN MEMOIRS FOR 1762 PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IN WHICH THERE IS A MEMOIRE ENTITLEDEXPERIENCES SUR LE POIDS DU SEL ET LA GRAVITE SPECIFIQUE DES SAUMURES FAITES ET ANALYSEES PAR M LAMBERT IN THIS MEMOIRE THE VERY INGENIOUS AUTHOR HATH MADE MUCH USE OF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO CALL IN QUESTION IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS PAPER AND HATH CALCULATED THE DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF SEA SALT WHICH ARE ABSORBED INTO351 INTO THE PORES OF WATER WHEN A GIVEN QUANTITY IS DISSOLVED IN DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF WATER THE AD MISSION OF THIS PRINCIPLE HATH DRAWN HIM INTO SOME CONCLUSIONS WHICH SEEM NOT QUITE CONSONANT TO TRUE PHILOSOPHY AS WHEN HE ASSERTS THAT THE QUANTITY WHICH IS ABSORBED INTO THE PORES IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE NUMBER OF THE PORES OR THE QUANTITY OF WATER FOR IF A GIVEN QUANTITY OF WATER SUPPOSE A WILL ABSORB A GIVEN QUANTITY OF ANY SALT SUPPOSE A I CAN SEE NO POSSIBLE REASON WHY M A SHOULD NOT ABSORB M A FOR IMAGINING M A TO BE DIVIDED INTO PORTIONS RESPECTIVELY EQUAL TO A AND EQUAL QUANTITIES OF SALT TO BE DISSOLVED IN EACH OF THEM THEN FROM THE SUP POSITION EACH OF THEM WILL ABSORB A AND WHEN THEY ARE ALL MIXED TOGETHER AS NO PRECIPITATION WILL ENSUE THE SUM OR M A MUST HAVE ABSORBED M A BUT I HAVE NO INCLINATION TO ANIMADVERT UPON WHAT SEEMS TO BE A SMALL MISTAKE OF AN AUTHOR WHOSE VARIOUS WRITINGS DO MUCH HONOUR TO PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL NOR TO INVOLVE MYSELF IN A DISPUTE WITH ANY ONE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT MAY PERHAPS BE THOUGHT CONCLUSIVE AGAINST THE DOCTRINE OF SALTS BEING ABSORBED INTO THE PORES OF WATER I TOOK A LARGE GLASS RECEIVER CONTAINING NEAR SIX GALLONS INTO ITS NECK BY MEANS OF A HOLE BORED THROUGH A CORK I CEMENTED A SMALL GLASS TUBE AND HAVING FILLED THE WHOLE UP TO THE MIDDLE OF THE TUBE WITH WATER I DROPPED IN A PIECE OF SEA SALT WEIGHING LESS THAN ONE FORTY THOUSANDTH PART THE WEIGHT OF THE WATER THE WATER INSTANTLY ROSE IN THE TUBE CONTINUED SINKING DURING THE SOLUTION BUT AT LAST REMAINED AS MUCH ELEVATED AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THERE BEEN NO 3 MORE352 MORE WATER THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DISSOLVE IT IN MAKING THIS EXPERIMENT THE RE CEIVER SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED BY THE HAND FOR ITS PARTS SUDDENLY EXPANDING THEMSELVES OCCASION AN INSTANTANEOUS SINKING OF THE WATER IN THE TUBE AS I HAVE FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCED AND MIGHT THUS IN DUCE A SUSPICION OF THE WATERS NOT BEING ELEVATED BY THE ADDITION OF SALT I WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS TO DENY THE POROSITY OF WATER SINCE PHILOSOPHERS HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE PAS SAGE OF LIGHT THROUGH IT AND OTHER PHAENOMENA INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF VACUITIES IN IT BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE HOWEVER SOLUTION BE CARRIED ON THAT THE SMALLEST QUANTITY OF SALT CAN BE DISSOLVED IN THE LARGEST QUANTITY OF WATER WITHOUT INCREASING ITS MAGNITUDE THE CAUSE OF THE WATERS SINKING DURING SOLUTION DOTH NOT APPEAR TO BE SO CERTAIN THE ESCAPE OF AIR TO WHICH ALL THE APPEARANCES INDUCED ME TO REFER IT AND TO WHICH IT MAY PERHAPS STILL BE OWING SEEMS TO BE LIABLE TO SOME OBJECTIONS NOT ONLY FROM THE EXPERIMENTS I HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED BUT FROM THE FOLLOWING E X P E R I M E N T XII I TOOK TWO MATRASSES OF EQUAL DIMENSIONS ONE FILLED WITH COMMON WATER THE OTHER WITH BOILED WATER I POURED INTO THEM EQUAL QUANTITIES OF OIL OF VITRIOL IN THE FIRST THERE SEEMED TO BE AN UNIVER SAL PRECIPITATION OF AIR AS IT WERE FROM EVERY PARTICLE OF THE FLUID WHICH BY LITTLE AND LITTLE FORM ED ITSELF INTO LARGER BUBBLES AND ASCENDING THROUGH THE353 THE NECK ESCAPED IN THE OTHER HARDLY ANY AIR COULD BE OBSERVED THE WATER SUNK DURING THE SO LUTION OF THE ACID VERY APPARENTLY YET 11000TH PART OF THE WATERS WEIGHT OF ACID CAUSED A SENSIBLE ELEVATION SO THAT WHATEVER MAY BE THOUGHT OF THE CAUSE OF THE WATERS SINKING DURING THE SOLUTION OF A SALT THE PRINCIPLE OF ITS BEING TO A CERTAIN DEGREE IMBIBED INTO THE PORES OF WATER SEEMS IN NO CASE TO BE TRUE WHETHER THE SALT BE IN A CONCRETE OR FLUID FORM THIS SUBJECT MAY RECEIVE SOME ILLUSTRATION FROM WHAT IS OBSERVED IN THE FREEZING OF WATER ICE FROM COMMON WATER IS ALWAYS SPECIFICALLY LIGHTER THAN WATER FROM ITS RETAINING IN ITS CONCRETE FORM SEVERAL AIRBUBBLES WHICH ENLARGE ITS BULK WITHOUT ADDING TO ITS WEIGHT THIS ICE WHEN PUT INTO A MATRASS AFTER THE MANNER IN WHICH ALL THE PRECED ING EXPERIMENTS WITH SALTS WERE MADE WOULD ELEVATE THE WATER MOST UPON THE FIRST IMMERSION THE WATER WOULD SINK AS THE ICE MELTED EQUAL PORTIONS OF ICE WOULD PRODUCE EQUAL ELEVATIONS BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER SOLUTION THE AIR WOULD BE SEPARATED IN A FORM MORE OR LESS VISIBLE ACCORDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE EXPERIMENT SHOULD BE TRIED AND NOT THE SMALLEST PORTION OF ICE COULD BE DISSOLVED WITHOUT INCREASING THE BULK OF THE WHOLE SALTS DO NOT SEEM TO DIFFER MUCH FROM ICE IN THE MANNER OF THEIR FORM ATION AND AS SIMILAR PHAENOMENA ATTEND THEIR SOLUTION IN WATER WHY MAY WE NOT EXPLAIN THEM FROM THE SAME CAUSE BUT IF ANY ONE SHOULD THINK DIFFERENTLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED I PROFESS MYSELF EXTREMELY READY TO LISTEN TO ANY REASONING FOUNDED UPON EXPERIMENT WHICH VOL LX Z Z MAY354 MAY TEND TO PROVE MY OPINION TO BE

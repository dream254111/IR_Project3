j100011,Biological Bulletin,1535577,A Theory of the Nature of Protoplasmic Respiration and Growth,i268248,A THEORY OF THE NATURE OF PROTOPLASMIC RESPIRATION AND GROWTH A P MATHEWS Respiration is probably the most fundamental of living pro cesses It is common to all forms of protoplasm as long as it persists protoplasm is said to live when it ceases protoplasm dies and it is the point of attack of the most powerful poisons such as the isocyanides Most of the other protoplasmic func tions depend directly or indirectly on respiration as for example the discharge of impulses from the nerve cells the beating of the heart and so on The protoplasmic syntheses and many of the decompositions have been ascribed since Drechsels work and that of HoppeSeyler to this fundamental process In any general theory of respiration the following facts have to be explained I Even though surrounded by oxygen all protoplasm main tains itself while alive in a reduced state and acts as an intense reducing agent Its reducing powers are comparable to those of nascent hydrogen 2 For all forms of protoplasm free oxygen above a certain tension is an intense poison For some forms this tension may be no more than a very small fraction of an atmosphere for others it is from three to four atmospheres 3 Atmospheric oxygen has little oxidizing power whereas protoplasm brings about oxidation of the most radical nature and is comparable in its oxidizing powers to the most intense chemical oxidizing agents 4 Hydrogen is evolved as a gas by a great variety of bacteria and moulds 5 The production of carbon dioxide by protoplasm stands in no direct or immediate relation to the consumption of free oxygen 6 Many forms of protoplasm such as the anaerobic bacteria are able to bring about intense oxidations in the absence of atmospheric oxygen 331A P MATHEWS The only general theory of the nature of respiration which has been carefully worked out is that of HoppeSeyler According to this hypothesis there occurs in the cell a fermentative decom position of some substance analogous in all respects to the fer mentative decomposition of calcium formate by many bacteria CHO22Ca  H 20 CaCO3  CO2  2H2 By this fermentation nascent hydrogen is set free the nascent hydrogen keeps the protoplasm in its reduced state it com bines with one atom of the oxygen of the air to form water and sets free the other atom as nascent oxygen which thus causes the intense oxidations of protoplasm This hypothesis was attacked by Traube who showed in many cases that the process included the formation of hydrogen peroxide which was the real oxidizing agent HoppeSeyler demonstrated however that some of these oxidations were more powerful than hydrogen peroxide which is not a very strong oxidizing agent could produce With the discovery of the oxidases HoppeSeylers hypoth esis has fallen into the background without the oxidase hypoth esis giving a better explanation in its stead The manner of action of the oxidases is still obscure their chemical composi tion is unknown and no oxidase will cause oxidations in the absence of oxygen whereas many forms of protoplasm can carry out such oxidations in the presence of no free oxygen at all or only of traces of free oxygen The studies of Armstrong Dixon and others on the pro cesses of slow and explosive oxidations and combustions throw in my opinion a remarkably clear light on protoplasmic respira tion These authors have shown that in ordinary oxidation the presence of some water is necessary to the oxidation Phos phorus in a perfectly dry state will not ignite in dry air Arm strong 2 concludes that the primary oxidation in all these cases is not brought about by the gaseous oxygen but by the water The atmospheric oxygen acts the part only of a depolarizer to take care of the nascent hydrogen formed from the water 1 HoppeSeyler Physiologische Chemie I Theil Allgemeine Biologie p 126 ff Berlin I877 2Armstrong Chemzical News July 15 1904 vol 90 p 25 Transactions Chem ical Soc vol 63 p io88 1903 332NATURE OF PROTOPLASMIC RESPIRATION The formula for the rusting of iron on this hypothesis would be as follows I Fe  20H2  FeOH2  2H II 4H  O2 2HaO or 2H  02  H202 H202 Fe F eO  H20 Reaction I cannot go on unless oxygen is present to remove the nascent hydrogen If no oxygen is present the nascent hydrogen at once reduces the iron oxide and forms metallic iron again The atmospheric oxygen does not unite with the iron but with the hydrogen The same hypothesis will explain protoplasmic respiration and at once makes clear the identity of anaerobic and aerobic respira tion The following theory of respiration is founded in part on Armstrongs work The real respiration of all forms of protoplasm both aerobic and anaerobic is brought about not by the oxygen of the air but by that of the water The hydrogen set free from the water combines with other elements of the protoplasm thus keeping it reduced it also combines with the oxygen of the air if this is present to form water and in the absence of oxygen it may escape as free hydrogen The only difference between anaerobic and aerobic respiration is that the anaerobic protoplasm is so powerful a reducing agent that it is able to drive hydrogen out of the water thus oxidizing itself without the aid of atmospheric oxygen to act as a depolarizer AErobic protoplasm being less powerfully reducing requires the presence of more or less oxygen to take care of the hydrogen The difference between these different kinds of protoplasm is exactly the difference between metallic sodium and metallic iron Sodium is so powerful a reducing agent that it oxidizes itself at the expense of water driving out hydrogen even in an atmos phere of hydrogen This corresponds to anaerobic protoplasm Na  HOH  NaOH  H Iron is so weak a reducing agent that it requires the presence of free oxygen to take care of the hydrogen set free before it will oxidize itself This corresponds to aerobic respiration Pro 333A P MATHEWS toplasmic respiration therefore is in reality not the consumption of gaseous oxygen and the liberation of carbon dioxide as ordi narily stated We now know that the production of carbon dioxide stands in no direct causal relation to the consumption of oxygen Respiration is in fact the dissociation of water witlh the liberation of hydrogen The evidences of the truth of this hypothesis are many and have been collected in part by HoppeSeyler Hydrogen is produced and set free as such by a great many moulds and bacteria i e coli communis penicillium butyricus etc In the case of facultative anaerobes like the colon bacillus the hydrogen appears only if no atmospheric oxygen is present it is burned to water if this be present In many cases where the hydrogen is not set free as such it escapes as marsh gas or combines with the protoplasm or some of the constituents of the culture medium such as levulose or sulphur Thus as HoppeSeyler showed in the fermentation of calcium acetate the hydrogen unites with the methyl or methylene set free by fermentation and comes off as marsh gas CH3CO22Ca  H20  CaCO3  CO2  2CH4 In the second place hydrogen is set free in the case of some bacteria which are able to oxidize substances in the absence of oxygen In this case the oxygen can only have come from the water Such a case has been reported recently by Maze In the case of a certain bacterium alcohol was oxidized to acetic acid in the absence of air if levulose was present The levulose was at the same time converted into mannite The reaction was probably as follows I C2H50OH  H20  C2H402  4H II 4H  2C6H206  2C6H1406 Mannite Reaction I can only go on in a positive direction or from left to right if some substance is present to remove the hydrogen and thus prevent equilibrium from being established It will be seen that as atmospheric oxygen acts the part only of a depolarizer any other oxidizing agent that is any other sub  Maze Annales de l nstitut Pasteur XVII 334NATURE OF PROTOPLASMIC RESPIRATION stance which unites readily with nascent hydrogen can replace the atmospheric oxygen and permit oxidation to go on in the absence of air In the example just cited levulose acts in this way This principle is of considerable importance in bacteriology The hypothesis just stated necessitates as will be seen a total abandonment of the common interpretation of anaerobic respiration as taking place at the expense of the oxygen of some food stuffs and shows at a glance the identity of the process in aerobic and anaerobic forms What is the nature of the process going on in protoplasm by which this decomposition of water is produced  A great number of reactions occur of just this type in organic and inorganic chemistry One of the most striking is the oxida tion of alcohol to aldehyde accompanied by the reduction of benzophenone to benzopinakon which occurs when an alcoholic solution of benzophenone is exposed to sunlight The interpre tation of this reaction as given by Nefs1 brilliant hypothesis gives at the same time an interpretation of the living respiration which wonderfully simplifies the problem of the chemical basis of life According to Nef many organic reactions are brought about by a change in valence of the carbon atom from four to two In the case just cited alcohol in the sunlight splits off water to some degree just as it does when heated and forms extremely active ethylidene particles as follows I CH3  CH2OH  CH  CH   H20 Ethylidene If now benzophenone is present to act as a depolarizer the active ethylidene attacks the water and oxidizes itself to aldehyde setting free nascent hydrogen which reduces the benzophenone II CH3  CH  OH2   CHCH 0  2H Aldehyde III 2H  2C6H2CO C6H2CHO2 l Benzopinakone It will be seen how exactly this process fulfills the require ments of the facts for a complete theory of respiration Owing 1 Nef Liebigs Annalen vol 335 1904 p I92 335A P MATHEWS therefore to Nefs hypothesis and without this the exact mechan ism of the process would be obscure the following picture of protoplasmic respiration may be formed In protoplasm there is some substance or substances of unknown nature which splits off water from itself just as the alco hol does in the above reaction or as ammonium hydrate does and sets free from itself active particles having the properties of ethyl idene The following three well known reactions are exactly similar to this primary process NH4OH H3N   H20 H2S3 02SH 20 C2HO5H  CH3 CH   H2 For protoplasm the reaction is as follows R CH20H RCH H20 In this reaction RCH2OH is some unknown substance The nature of the substances thus reacting in protoplasm is unknown There is no evidence however nor is there any reason for assuming that they are complex substances It is probably not a substance acting by means of a change in valence of nitrogen for the reason that the nitrogen substances such as ammonia do not have so great an affinity for oxygen as that required of the unknown substance We do not get for example such a decom position of ammonia as this NH3   OH2  H3NO  H2 On the other hand the substance possesses the powers ascribed by Nef to bivalent carbon Carbon has a powerful affinity for oxygen It may well be therefore that the substance is a car bon compound presumably of simple nature and derived directly or indirectly from the foods so that new raw material for the reaction is constantly supplied If this is the case Nefs view that bivalent carbon is at the bottom of the vital reaction would be justified 1 Probably all reducing agents act in some measure in this way For example in egg white a substance is present which forms sulphuretted hydrogen in the presence of sulphur This substance is of unknown nature The reaction probably is a follows XCHOH2 XCHO 2H 2H 4 S  H2S 336NATURE OF PROTOPLASMIC RESPIRATION Whatever their composition may be the active particles attack the water of the protoplasm oxidize themselves to aldehydes and set free nascent hydrogen R  CH  OH RCHO  2H This explains the presence of aldehydes in protoplasm the production of hydrogen by many or all forms of protoplasm as assumed by HoppeSeyler and the keeping of the cell protoplasm in a reduced state It is perfectly clear that surrounded by oxygen as most protoplasm is it could not possibly continue in its reduced condition if some strong reducing agent such as hydrogen was not constantly produced If too much free oxy gen is present the aldehydes will be converted into acids the reaction of the protoplasm changed and the life of the cell destroyed Oxygen in other words above a certain pressure is poisonous for protoplasm In those forms of protoplasm called anaerobic the active par ticles are of such a character and so powerful that in the absence of oxygen they can like sodium oxidize themselves and set free hydrogen or in the presence of certain foods which will com bine with hydrogen such as levulose they are able to oxidize themselves In those forms of protoplasm called aerobic the active particles are not so powerful and require the aid of atmos pheric oxygen to combine with the hydrogen before they can decompose water While the active particles are formed spon taneously the conditions in protoplasm may be such as to accel erate their formation ferment action see Nef A few examples will perhaps make clear the possible relations of this fundamental reaction to the synthetic properties of the protoplasm The fundamental nature of most of these syntheses is simple and consists in the elimination of water between two simple molecules to form a complex molecule as for example in the condensation of the amino acids to form albumin of the monosaccharids to form disaccharids and polysaccharids of the amino acids to form pyrimidin of the alcohols and fatty acids to form fats of ammonia and oxyacids to form amino acids Two explanations of this process may be given That of Drechsel is the first According to this theory the elements to 337A P MATHEWS form water are eliminated by a successive oxidation and reduc tion of the substances A type of this reaction is the conversion of ammonium carbamate into urea NH40CONH2  0  NH20CONH2  H20 NH20CONH2  2H  NH2CONH2  H20 Urea Upon the basis of this hypothesis Drechsel succeeded outside the cell by rapidly alternating reductions and oxidations produced by induction shocks in obtaining urea from albumin in synthe sizing hippuric acid from benzoic acid and glycocoll and in syn thesizing ethereal sulphates These syntheses may thus very readily be the secondary result of that fundamental respiratory process characterized as it is by a simultaneous reduction and oxidation The syntheses may also be due as shown by Nef for many reactions to the condensation of active particles that is particles formed by the dissociation of organic substances and containing open valencies A typical synthesis of this sort would be the formation of olefine gas from methyl alcohol or the condensation of the isocyanides I 2H  NC  HNC   HNC  H2N2C2 II 2CH3OH  2CH2   2H0  C2H4  2H20 Olefine If in protoplasm conditions are such as to cause a good many active particles to be produced syntheses by condensations of all kinds must spontaneously and of necessity occur In this way it is seen that both growth and respiration are due to the spontane ous formation of active particles from the foods In the third place mere reduction may cause many syntheses A typical example of this sort is the condensation of acetone by nascent hydrogen CH3 CH3 CH3 CHI3 C  0 0 C 4H COH CH3 CH3 COH CH3 CH3 Acetone Pinacone 338NATURE OF PROTOPLASMIC RESPIRATION In this case a forked chain is produced in which the carbon atoms are attached directly Moreover from the aldehydes produced in the way indicated all manner of compounds will originate spontaneously as Loew has particularly pointed out Thus from formaldehyde formose and the sugars spontaneously originate in faintly alkaline solu tions glycerine aldehyde goes over of itself into a hexose sugar acetic aldehyde in the presence of ammonium cyanide forms propionic amidonitril which readily passes into amido propionic acid or alanin one of the most common constituents of the albumins The albumins themselves are nothing else as Kossel and Fischer have shown than condensed amino acids This condensation there is every reason to believe can be brought about by cell extracts since from the kidney a sub stance has been isolated which brings about identically the same kind of a condensation namely that of benzoic acid and glyco coll to form hippuric acid Finally by spontaneous union of the aldehydes with the cyanides found in so many cells carbon chains are built up readily outside the cell and presumably in the cell also since nitrils are not uncommon constituents of protoplasm Many other examples might be given here but these will I think indicate how completely the formation of substances found in protoplasm can be accounted for by means of this fundamental reaction which is going on These syntheses and decompositions must take place as a matter of course if the reaction is of the nature sketched I do not mean to imply that the amino acids for ex ample originate altogether in the manner indicated They may also be formed by the union of oxyacids dissociated in Nefs sense with NH3 without the intermediate formation of aldehydes or ketones Nef has shown that the lactates for example disso ciate as follows CH3 CH3 CHOH s C  I I COOM COOM Lactate If now NH3 is present union takes place directly with the bivalent carbon atom 339A P MATHEWS CH3 CH3 C  NH HCNH2 NH2 2 COOM COOM Alanin In any case it will be apparent that the synthetic powers of the cell depend on the same process as the respiratory powers While the interpretation of the exact mechanism by which the respiratory substance or substances for there may be many such substances in one cell dissociate water depends as will be seen upon Nefs hypothesis and is due to this hypothesis the general hypothesis that such dissociation of water is taking place and that this is the basis of respiration is independent of Nefs hypothesis If however that hypothesis be accepted and of its truth he has already produced so many proofs as to entitle it to pro visional acceptance we can go farther and ascribe this most fundamental of living reactions and many protoplasmic syntheses to methylene dissociation that is to bivalent carbon particles in protoplasm as Nef himself has pointed out Protoplasmic res piration must in any case be defined in the light of known facts somewhat differently from the ordinary statement Respiration is that process going on in protoplasm by which water is decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen The oxygen combines with the substances of the protoplasm thus oxidizing them the hydrogen is either set free in the gaseous form or it is united with atmospheric oxygen to form water or it combines with other substances in the protoplasm The reaction may be written as follows For anaerobic protoplasm I RCH20H  R CH   H20 II RCHOH2RCH OH1 For aerobic protoplasm I R C H20H R CH  H20 II R CH OH O  RCH O H20 or III R  CH   0112  02  RCH 0  H202 IV R CH   H202  R CH 0 H20 1 A great number of reactions of this type are given in Nefs paper already referred to See also Nef Journal of the American Chemical Society Vol XXVI 1904 p 1549 340NATURE OF PROTOPLASMIC RESPIRATION The views expressed in this paper may be harmonized with those in a previous paper in which the oxidations and reductions going on in protoplasm were regarded as electrical if the follow ing explanation of the dissociation of NH4OH into NH3 and H20 be adopted At present no clear connection between ionic dissociation and such dissociations as that of ammonia has been established The relation of the two processes may be the fol lowing if Thompsons electron hypothesis be adopted In sodium chloride the sodium and chlorine are held together by the affinity each has for a negative electron NaeCl On going into aqueous solution the atoms separate and chlorine having the greater affinity for the electron  1965 volts to  254 volts for the sodium in normal solution takes it away from the sodium The sodium being thus left with an unsaturated affinity for a negative charge becomes a positive ion the chlor ine with a free negative charge becomes a negative ion The free charges being on separate atoms and free to move the solu tion conducts the current In the albumin molecule of am photer reaction hydrogen ions are dissociated at one place hy droxyl at another A free positive charge and a free negative charge reside on the same molecule though on different atoms The albumin molecule may therefore be unable to take part in the conduction of the current although ionized   H 0 albumin  0OH In the nitrogen atom as it exists in ammonia the opposite charges are on the same atom The condition may be repre sented as follows where nitrogen is trivalent Ho  H0 N Oz Ho Y If N is the nitrogen atom it has three valencies satisfied by hydrogen At x and y two points on its surface there is a posi tive charge not entirely compensated by the atom itself This charge is compensated by the electron z This electron may be regarded as holding together the two parts of the nitrogen atom at xand y just as the electron held together the separate atoms l Mathews Amer Journal of Physiology 1904 X p 290 34IA P MATHEWS of sodium and chlorine In this case I assume the condition is that of Nefs polarized valencies Particles in this condition he assumes to be inert so far as valencies x andy are concerned Nef assumes that these polarized valencies open up and they open up more readily under some conditions than under others For example the polarized valencies of the carbon atom open up when the carbon is joined to nitrogen as in the isocyanides far more easily than they do when the carbon is joined to oxygen as in carbon monoxide The opening up of the valence is I think identical in character with the dissociation of a salt into its ions The opening of these valencies constitutes a dissociation of valencies It makes of course no difference theoretically whether those valencies are on the same atom or on different atoms At any rate NH3 goes over into HO   HOeN He yz These are Nefs active particles It is only when in this condi tion of dissociation that these valencies will combine One of these valencies x is positive the other y is negative Such particles although they are really in an ionic form cannot con duct the current because they are positive and negative at the same time These particles combine as follows H0O  eOH HON Ho H Exactly the same reasoning applies to all atoms including bivalent carbon It will be seen therefore that this explanation which is but a trifling addition to the fundamental idea of Nef of polarized valencies would bring the respiratory reactions into the domain of electrical reactions No doubt this explanation has occurred to others and I give it only as a convenient picture It bridges so well the gap between Nefs views of organic re actions and Ostwalds hypothesis that inorganic reactions are ionic that it may be useful It will be noticed also that upon this view residual valencies may be pictured as polarized valencies and in each case both pos 342NATURE OF PROTOPLASMIC RESPIRATION itive and negative valencies are opened simultaneously The number of residual valencies may be considerable since upon Thompsons hypothesis of the electronic constitution of matter the movement outward of any electron owing to the speed of rotation of the atom or a disturbance of its electrical equilib rium would open up such valencies In fact the whole atom would be made up of polarized valencies if we look at it in this way SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The foregoing hypothesis has a close bearing on the spon taneous origin of living matter As a result of chemical and histological work it is now clear that living matter is a mixture of various substances and is not a chemical compound there is no living compound While this conclusion may not be ad mitted by all it is in my opinion clearly established There is no longer any doubt that the different phenomena of life are due to different constituents in this mixture The histological phys iological pharmacological and chemical evidence is unanimous on this point The problem of the origin of life no longer appears therefore under its former guise of how the foods are transformed into a living molecule or compound but in its place we have instead how are the foods transformed into the mixture of substances which is called living matter The question which we have to answer is this is the transfor mation of the foods into living matter produced by the foods or is it produced by the living matter At first glance everyone would say that the transformation was caused by the living matter This is the answer everyone has given hitherto and its truth appears to be selfevident If we mix the foods by them selves they do not produce living matter This answer has made it difficult to see how living matter originated on the earth Preexisting living matter was always needed to get living matter In the light of the foregoing discussion and the study of the transformations of the foods in protoplasm it appears highly prob able that this answer is erroneous Living matter does not cause the transformation of foods into living matter as we imagine instead the foods today spontaneously change themselves into living matter just as they did at the beginning The change goes on very rapidly in living matter but very slowly outside 343The cause of the formation of living matter is to be sought in the foods and not in the living matter As this conclusion has not so far as I know been hitherto per ceived the reasons for it may be briefly presented They are in brief two The examination of protoplasm has shown that it contains a great number of catalyzing agents or ferments So many of these have been found in all cells and so clearly do protoplasmic reactions partake of this nature that the opinion is widely accepted that the chemical transformation of the foods in protoplasm into the substances constituting protoplasm is brought about by ferments The work which has been done by the phys ical chemists and others upon ferments shows in the clearest manner that ferments are substances which do not cause reac tions they only accelerate reactions which will go on anyway in their absence but which go on very slowly Ferments there fore are accelerators of spontaneous reactions Zymase does not cause the decomposition of the sugar molecule it only accel erates its decomposition The necessary result of this funda mental conception of the nature of ferment actions is this the nature of the chemical transformations which the foods undergo in protoplasm is not altered or determined by the protoplasm The nature of the transformation is determined by the foods protoplasm by means of the ferments it contains only influences the rate of the transformation This means as already pointed out that the foods must spontaneously transform themselves into the mixture called protoplasm if given time enough In proto plasm this transformation goes on very rapidly because some of the products of the reaction act as catalyzers to hasten the rate of this or that phase of the reaction In the second place a careful study of the transformations of the foods within and outside of protoplasm has failed to show a single instance in which the character of the transformation is different in two cases This result is now so well understood in physiological chemistry that if we wish to discover what sub stances are formed out of any food or other substance during its passage through protoplasm we subject the substance to de compositions hydrolytic oxidative or reducing outside the body determine the substances formed and then look for these substances in the organism knowing that they will be formed there also 344 A P MATHEWSNATURE OF PROTOPLASMIC RESPIRATION In the third place a mass of evidence shows that substances outside the body simply dissolved in water break up at a very slow rate but into the same compounds in many instances as ap pear at a rapid rate in protoplasm These facts may be summarized in the general statement Living matter does not determine the clharacter of the transfor mation of the foods it only determines the rate of transformation This conclusion at once makes clear that living matter is today originating spontaneously from the foods just as it always has The transformation goes on now very rapidly owing to catalyzers in protoplasm whereas originally the transformation probably went on slowly until some of the products of the reac tion were produced which acted as catalyzers for this or that phase What we call living matter is of importance in the proc ess only because it contains from the outset these endproduct catalyzers formed from the previous reaction The whole proc ess is I conceive as follows The carbon constitutents of the foods spontaneously decom pose By this decomposition particles in a nascent state are formed Upon Nefs hypothesis these would be particles with bivalent carbon Whatever their nature these nascent particles either act on the water oxidizing themselves to aldehydes or ketones and setting free hydrogen and in this manner causing protoplasmic respiration or they combine with each other to form the various constituents of protoplasm and thus cause growth What they combine with depends on what substance is near when they become nascent If it is ammonia amids aminoacids and other nitrogen compounds are formed if an other carbon compound the carbon chains are built up and the complex substances which make up protoplasm The whole process is due to a spontaneous dissociation of the food mole cules and is not due to any vital energy Some of the endprod ucts of this spontaneous rearrangement act as ferments that is as accelerators of some phase of the reaction or they may act as negative catalyzers delaying some phase Examples of such processes are well known in chemical reactions In exactly what manner they accelerate or delay the reaction is not certain The bearings of this conclusion upon many problems of biol ogy and particularly upon the problem of differentiation in 345A P MATHEWS development is obvious The substances produced from the foods depend on the foods and not on the protoplasm The so called organforming substances of the egg described by Whitman Lillie Conklin and others determine necessarily the character of the protoplasm formed from them There is but one other fac tor to be considered i e the presence of catalyzers which may accelerate different phases of a reaction By this means a food substance undergoing in many different cells the same course of transformation will give rise in each to different proportions of substances depending upon what stage of its transformation is accelerated Thus for example a sugar undergoing one trans formation into alcohol lactic acid and carbon dioxide or other substances may very readily give rise almost exclusively to lactic acid if the proper phase is accelerated In this way it is possible to see how the same foods in differ ent protoplasms will form substances which are present in the different cells in widely different proportions A specific instance will make this clear Aminoacids spontaneously split off the amid group and form oxyacids This occurs at a very slow rate and is a reversible change In the liver of mammals there is a catalyzer which greatly accelerates this transformation The re sult is that in this organ quantities of ammonia are produced and a nonnitrogenous residue In cells lacking this ferment this reaction goes on so slowly that there is no opportunity for the accumulation and farther decomposition and recombination of the products thus set free Numerous other examples will occur to all physiological chemists In conclusion I wish to point out that this conception is in many important particulars only an application to some of the problems of physiological chemistry of Nefs theory of the nature of organic chemical reactions As will be seen from this paper I believe that his hypothesis of the spontaneous decomposition of organic molecules with the formation of extremely reactive dissociation products throws a new light on the chemical trans formations in protoplasm and that many of those reactions become clear at once if it be assumed that the reactive particles have the properties of bivalent carbon The importance of this theory for physiological chemistry is not yet sufficiently recognized 346

j100128,Columbia Law Review,1110606,A Revival of Codification,i246281,A REVIVAL OF CODIFICATION Almost a century has passed since Jeremy Bentham addressed to President Madison his famous proposal to prepare a complete code of law for the United States Give me Sir wrote Bentham the necessary encouragement I mean a letter importing approbation of this my humble pro posal and as far as depends upon yourself acceptance I will forthwith set about drawing up for the use of the United States or such of them if any as may see reason to give their acceptance to it a complete body of proposed law in the form of Statute law say in one word a Pannomiona body of statute law including a succedaneum to that mass of foreign law the yoke of which in the wordless as well as boundless and shapeless shape of comnnon alias unwritten law remains still about your necks 1 The letter went unanswered for a number of years and the answer when made though very courteous was a virtual declina tion of the great codifiers offer on the ground that a compliance with your proposals would not be within the scope of my proper functions 2 Meanwhile Bentham had extended similar proposals to the Governors of several States and shortly after the receipt of President Madisons answer he proffered his services to the citizens of the several American United States 3 Two of the GovernorsSnyder of Pennsylvania and Plumer of New Hampshirewere captivated by the philanthropic communi cation They urged its consideration upon their respective legis latures but without favorable result Governor Plumer promptly intimated to Bentham his own lack of power in the matter as well as his misgivings about the attitude of the legislature How far it is practicable to establish such a system in New Hampshire I cannot determine he writes We have not only a host of prej udices to encounter but the interests of a body of lawyers many of whom here as in all other countries dread reform fearing it would diminish their individual profits 4 Benthams Works Vol 4 p 45I The italics and capitals are the au thors The date of the letter is Oct 18II Ibid 467 The letter is dated May 8 I816 In replying to it in Sep tember 1817 Bentham remarked Length of intervals considered our cor respondence has been better suited to an antediluvian life than to one which is so near its close as mine is 3Ibid 478507 Ibid 577A REVIVAL OF CODIFICATION That the Governors misgivings were well founded is shown by an extract published by Bentham from a private letter written to him by one whom he styles a distinguished Functionary in the United States Member of the House of Representatives in his State and Delegate therefrom to Congress 5 This letter assures Bentham that his proposal was fairly brought before the legislature by Governor Plumer that to give it a better chance of success a son of the Governor who was a member caused the greater part of an article on this subject in a late Edinburgh Review6 to be published and distributed among the legislators but that all the lawyers of that body except the Governors son declared it inex pedient to accept the codification proposal These lawyers Ben thams distinguished friend assured him were actuated by various motives Some believed that the common law was the perfection of reason Others who were advanced in years did not like the idea of adopting a new system which would compel them to learn the law over again Still others were perhaps swayed by the persuasion that the new system would prove injurious to the pro fession by rendering the law more clear and explicit and thus diminishing the profits which are at present derived from its un certainty and obscurity Whether the legal profession were actuated by the sinister motives thus ascribed to them may well be doubted but there can be no doubt that the great majority of the bench and bar both in England and the United States were opposed a century ago and are still opposed to Benthamistic codification They have not be lieved with Benthams distinguished but unnamed functionary of New Hampshire that a pannomion does constitute the beau ideal of law On the other hand they have looked askance at all attempts to codify our private law7 Notwithstanding this traditional attitude of the legal profession its members seem to be growing more and more tolerant of the idea of enacting what Bentham styled particular codes that is codes containing such matters only with which some one class or denomination of persons only have concern8 Advocates of scientific codification like Sheldon Amos are as stoutly opposed Benthams Works Vol 4 p 578 Probably reference is made to Sir Samuel Romillys article in 29 Ed Rev 217 published Nov 1817 Perhaps the fullest and best reasoned statement of objections to such codification is found in Mr Carters posthumous work Law Its Origin Growth and Function 8Benthams Works Vol 4 p 454 119COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW to such enactments as they are to the old policy as they conceive it of allowing law to be made by judicial legislation Mr Amos refers to the particular codifiers as those who are fond of speak ing of gradual or progressive codification They desire to reconstruct large portions of the law each severally by itselfin fact converting all the law on each separate topic into a statute the statutes being quite independent of one another or only casu ally related The subjects to be thus codified in turn would be chosen either in view of their apparent importance or of the pressing need they stand in of having some process of reorganiza tion performed upon them Mr Amos fears that the codifier of this sort may interpose permanent barriers in his path which shall forever prevent him from progressing to the highest point of per fection viz the production of the ideal code which he declares is eminently a product of logical art 9 In the face of this and abundant other criticism the progress ive codifiers have been making considerable progress both in England and on this side of the Atlantic The first of their pro ductions to secure Parliamentary sanction was the Bills of Ex change Act I88210 although several years earlier Sir James FitzJames Stephen had done pioneer service in the cause by his Digest of the Law of Evidence and had been followed by Sir Frederick Pollock with his Digest of the Law of Partnership Judge Chalmers tells us that the idea of codifying the law of nego tiable instruments was first suggested by the Digest of the Law of Evidence and he ascribes the success of his Bill to the wise lines laid down by Lord Herschell who insisted that the Bill should be introduced in a form which did nothing more than codify existing law and that all amendments should be left to Parliament A Bill he adds which merely improves the form without alter ing the substance of the law creates no opposition and gives very little room for controversy    I am sure that further codifying measures can be got through Parliament if those in charge of them will not attempt too much but will be content to follow the lines laid down by Lord Herschell Let a codifying Bill in the first instance simply reproduce existing law however defective If the defects are patent and glaring it will be easy to get them amended If an amendment be opposed it can be dropped without sacrificing the Bill The form of the law at any rate is improved and its substance can always be amended by subsequent legislation If a Bill when introduced proposes to effect changes in the law every clause is looked at askance and it is sure to encounter opposition 9Amos The Science of Law Ch XIII Chalmers Bills of Exchange Act 5th ed xliv Ibid xliv xlvii 120A REVIVAL OF CODIFICATION I his policy was adopted by Sir Frederick Pollock whose Part nership Bill considerably amended became The Partnership Act I890 and by Judge Chalmers again in the Bill which became the Sale of Goods Act 1894 Another fundamental tenet of these successful codifiers is that while any branch of the law is in process of formation it is un wise to attempt to codify it To quote Judge Chalmers again A code should be formed on a firm basis of experience You then know what you are doing A practical and working code cannot spring from the head of the draftsman as Pallas Athene is fabled to have sprung fully equipped from the head of her father Zeus In legislation as in other sciences the a priori road is a dangerous one to tread When the principles of the law are well settled and when the decided cases that accumulate are in the main mere illustrations of accepted general rules then the law is ripe for codification A code can usefully settle disputed points and fill up small lacunae in the law but it should always have its feet on the ground If you go above and beyond experience you are codi fying in the air and will probably do more harm than good to commerce and mercantile law No service is done to the cause of codification by putting the case for it too high The province of a code I venture to think is to set out in concise language and logi cal form those principles of the law which have already stood the test of time 12 It is quite clear that the revival of codification in England is due to the fact that its promoters have been content to act upon the discreet and unambitious principles enunciated above by Judge Chalmers They have not posed as iconoclasts of the common law They have not proclaimed themselves law reformers They have not undertaken the task of substituting for existing law the law as it ought to be It has not been their aim to show themselves wiser than the courts On the other hand it will be observed they do not attempt to codify any branch of the law until its principles have become well settled And then their codes are not to contain experiments but are to embody experience The enactment of the Bills of Exchange statute in England aroused immediate interest in this country Resolutions were passed by the American Bankers Association at their meeting in I88213 favoring like legislation here Pursuant to this action a bill was drawn largely a copy of the English statute which was introduced in the House of Representatives May 12 1884 The constitutional power of Congress to legislate upon this topic was Codification of Mercantile Law 25 Am Bar Assoc Rep 282 I9 Law Quart Rev Io The date of the English Act is Aug I8 I882 121COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW questioned and no serious attempt was made to pass the bill Nor was the subject taken up by the several state legislatures A few years later however Gov David B Hill of New York suggested in his annual message14 that some motion should be made at this session toward a conference of representatives of all the States or of such as may choose to be represented to con sider the question of uniform marriage and divorce laws A re newal of this suggestion the following year15 led to the enactment of a law for the appointment of three commissioners to promote the uniformity of legislation in the United Statesxs At a meeting of the Tennessee Bar Association in 1889 President McFarland called the attention of that body to the desirability of securing uniform legislation on the topic specified by Gov Hill as well as on Taxation the acknowledgment of deeds the execution and probate of wills the inheritance of real estate and kindred ques tions Upon the motion of a delegate from Tennessee the Ameri can Bar Association at its meeting a few weeks later appointed a committee on uniform state legislationl7 As a result of this action by the State of New York and the American Bar Associa tion a conference of Commissioners from seven States met at Sara toga in I89218 Recommendations were made for uniformity in the forms of notarial certificates in the acknowledgment of deeds and certificates to be attached thereto in the execution of deeds and wills in the probate of wills and in legislation concerning marriage and divorce One of the commissioners read an able paper on the Problem of Uniform Legislation in the United States but no very definite action was taken in the matter9 Indeed for Public Papers of Gov Hill for I889 p 37 Public Papers of Gov Hill for I890 p 43 6Ch 2o5 L I89o The duty of these commissioners was described in the statutes as follows to examine the subjects of marriage and divorce in solvency the form of notarial certificates and other subjects to ascertain the best means to effect an assimilation and uniformity in the laws of the States and especially to consider whether it would be wise and practicable for the State of New York to invite the other States of the Union to send representatives to a convention to draft uniform laws to be submitted for the approval and adoption of the several States and to devise and recom mend such other course of action as shall best accomplish the purpose of this act lReports of Am Bar Assoc Vol 12 p 50 The reports of this Com mittee may be found in Vol 13 ibid p 336 and Vol 14 p 365 It is an interesting fact that one member of this original conference and one only is still a commissioner from his StateHon Peter W Meldrim of Georgianow VicePresident of the Conference and one of its most influential members Reports of the Am Bar Assoc Vol I5 p 287 122A REVIVAL OF CODIFICATION some years the energies of the commissioners were bent chiefly to securing the establishment of similar commissions in other States Not until I896 did they venture upon sending up to the state legislatures a bill of any length and that was described by their chairman as substantially the English Act of 1882 on Nego tiable Instruments 20 The favor with which this bill was received by state legislatures induced the commissioners to attempt the production of other bills During I9023 Professor Samuel Williston of Harvard at the request of the commissioners prepared a draft of an Act to make uniform the Law of Sales It followed pretty closely the lines of the English Sale of Goods Act In this form it did not prove entirely satisfactory to the Committee on Commercial Law who proceeded to make numerous changes in its provisions and to add a number of sections on the transfer of property in goods by means of documents of title As a result of these changes a bill was sent out which was not only at variance with the English Sale of Goods Act but with existing rules of law in most of our States It has not met with the legislative favor which was accorded to the Nego tiable Instruments Law and has been adopted in but five States and one Territory Possibly this is due in part to the fact that the commissioners disregarded Judge Chalmers advice and went above and beyond experience Legislators may agree with him in the belief that when codifiers do this they are codifying in the air and will probably do more harm than good to commerce and mercantile law In I904 the American Warehousemens Association placed a sum of money at the disposal of the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in the National Conference to meet the expense of the preparation of a draft of a uniform Act on the subject of Warehouse Receipts The money was accepted the draft was made and approved by the Conference in I906 and the bill has become law in eighteen States and Territories This statute changes existing law upon several points and has met with serious opposition from mercantile interests21 On the other hand certain interests were so anxious for it that they were ready to Reports of the Am Bar Assoc Vol I9 p 407 Notably the Merchants Association of New York City which num bers about two thousand mercantile firms and corporations and claims to be the most representative mercantile body in the United States both as to diversity of merchandise handled and amount of business done 123COLUM1BIA LAW REVIEW put up the money necessary for its preparation and to champion it before legislative bodies Still greater changes from existing law were incorporated in the Transfer of Stock Act and the Bills of Lading Act which were approved by the Conference of Commissioners in I909 By these proposed measures certificates of stock and bills of lading are to be made as fully negotiable as bills of exchange and promis sory notes If in such form as to be transferable by delivery a thief or a finder can pass perfect title to them and to the property represented by them to a purchaser in good faith for value22 Value is defined as any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract An antecedent or preexisting obligation whether for money or not constitutes value where a bill is taken either in satisfaction thereof or as security therefor And a thing is done in good faith when it is done honestly whether it be done negli gently or not 3 These provisions it is admitted when taken together work a radical change in the law So far as certificates of stock are con cerned there is no statute in England or in any of our States which carries their negotiability to the extent now proposed nor is there a decision of any court recognizing a mercantile usage of such negotiability On the other hand the ability of a thief or finder to pass title to certificates of stock though indorsed in blank even to a bona fide purchaser for value has been repeatedly denied by the courts on both sides of the Atlantic24 The proposed bill does not profess to codify existing law but to work a legal reform It breathes the spirit of Bentham not that of Chalmers Perhaps this spirit is even more apparent in the Bills of Lading Act As originally drawn this did not attempt to make a bill of lading fully negotiable It contained the same provisions on this point that are found in the Warehouse Receipts Act and the Sale of Goods Act Indeed the latter Act included bills of lading among the documents of title therein legislated upon and distinctly pro vided that a negotiable document of title may be negotiated a By the owner thereof or b By any person to whom the possession or custody of the document has been entrusted by the owner if by Transfer of Stock Act  3 5 Bills of Lading Act  31 32 Bills of Lading Act  53 The same definitions are contained in the Transfer of Stock Act 24Knox v Eden Musee Co I896 148 N Y 44I Scollans v Rollins 1899 173 Mass 275 and cases cited therein 121A REVIVAL OF CODIFICATION the terms of the document the bailee issuing the document under takes to deliver the goods to the order of the person to whom the possession or custody of the document has been entrusted or if at the time of such entrusting the document is in such form that it may be negotiated by delivery25 In commenting on this and a subsequent section the learned draftsman of the Act has said In this respect the Sales Act does not go to the full extent of the law of bills and notes There is this reason for drawing the line between a transfer by a custodian and a thief In the former case the owner of the document has voluntarily put it in the power of another to deceive a purchaser the deception is therefore accomplished by means which the owner has furnished the cus todian An element of estoppel exists which does not exist in the case of theft There seems no reason in justice in the latter case why the new bona fide purchaser should be preferred over the orig inal owner There is no doubt that under the existing law aside from statute a thief can give no title even to a bona fide purchaser whatever the form of the document of title 26 In accordance with these views the original provisions of the Bill of Lading Act did not permit a thief or a finder to transfer title to a bill of lading or to the goods which it represented These provisioris remained unquestioned until the preparation of the fourth tentative draft when section thirtyone was changed to read as follows WHO MAY NEGOTIATE A BILLA negotiable bill may be negotiated by any person in possession of the same however such possession may have been acquired if by the terms of the bill the carrier undertakes to deliver the goods to the order of such person or if at the time of negotiation the bill is in such form that it may be negotiated by delivery The reasons for this change were stated by the able and in fluential chairman of the Committee on Commercial Law at the last Conference of Commissioners substantially as follows When the Sale of Goods Act was drafted the subject of bills of lading had not been forcibly brought to the attention of the Committee or the Conference The Committee had not then had the benefit of expert opinion on the subject nor had the Committee had an opportunity to study the history of the development of bills of lading or ex amine what had been said on the subject by economic writers Sale of Goods Act  32 The same limitation on the power of transfer is found in the Warehouse Receipts Act  40 Williston Sales 749 125COLUMBIA L4AW REVIEW During the sessions of the Committee and the period which had intervened since the Sales Act was drawn matters had been brought to the attention of the Committee not before it when the Sales Act was adopted in the light of which the change had been made He believed it was demanded by the commercial interests of the country and supported by the views of economic writers It was also justified by legislative and judicial precedents in some States He thought the provision in the Sales Act on this topic an obsolete rule If that were restored in this Act he said I would be ashamed to go before any legislative body and present the Bills of Lading Act and if they asked me whether this was the best thought of the time say No it is not but this is the condition of stagnation that existed two years ago  2 Nothing could show better the tendency of the Conference of Commissioners to adopt the Benthamistic view of codification than this address of Mr James Uniformity of law is not to be sought in an Act embodying those existing rules which are sustained by the weight of judicial authority and satisfactory business ex perience throughout the United States but in an Act which sets forth the Commissioners ideals There is a fascination un doubtedly in restating the law in accordance with ones own notion of what the law ought to be Nor is the fascination greatly dimin ished though one convinces himself that his ideals accord with business usages or even with what those usages are tending to become Whether the Commissioners ought to yield to this fasci nation is a point upon which the present writer has grave doubts In his opinion better results will be achieved if the Conference and its Committees adhere strictly to the wise lines laid down by Lord Herschell and observed by Chalmers and Pollock Undoubtedly Mr James and those who follow his able leader ship believe that in attempting to put bills of lading into the same category with bills of exchange and promissory notes they are responding to the legitimate demands of commercial interests But some of the most influential representatives of those interests hold quite a different view The Merchants Association of New York City referred to earlier in this article is strenuously opposed to this provision especially in connection with the definitions of value and good faith which the Act contains28 Quite as strong opposition has been expressed by the Merchants and Miners Reports of Am Bar Assoc Vol 34 p o019 lbid Vol 34 p I085 126A REVIVAL OF CODIFICATION Transportation Company and by the various lines of carriers em ploying the Standard bill of lading29 This document contains the following clause This bill of lading is assignable it is negotiable only in so far as may be required to carry out the promise of the carrier made in the following surrender clause and is enforceable as provided in section ten of this bill of lading according to its original tenor and effect Even the American Bankers Association I am informed have never urged the full measure of negotiability of bills of lading which is provided in the uniform Bills of Lading Act although they have agreed to recommend that act for state adoption In the face of these facts and assurances the writer is curious to know what did convince the Committee on Commercial Law that noth ing short of full negotiability of bills of lading would properly sub serve business interests Certainly the extracts from economic writers which are set out in the Committees latest report30 do not appear very convincing For example Mr McPherson is thus quoted It the bill of lad ing is not only a certificate that merchandise is in transit but a first lien upon that merchandise in a way a title of ownership and as fulfilling this function negotiable In this as well as in the other quotations supplied by the Committee each author is describ ing bills of lading under existing law and not one of them fur nishes an argument or even drops a hint that existing law is so loose and out of joint as to need the heroic treatment prescribed in the Bills of Lading Act In a note to section thirtyone of this Act it is said This section and the following are of fundamental importance to the mercantile community They state familiar law in regard to bills and notes and there is authority for applying the same rules to bills of lading both in the statute making bills of lading nego tiable and in the decisions of courts recognizing mercantile custom In support of this statement six cases are cited It may be profitable to consider them briefly Reports Am Bar Assoc Vol 34 p I097 Mr Hayne counsel for the company and chairman of the Southern Classification SubCommittee writes under date Dec 30 I9o9 It is a pleasure to advise that the Standard Bill of Lading has worked admirably in all localities where it has been used which comprise substantially the entire section south of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi rivers and all water lines along the Atlantic coast from New York to Louisiana and some lines reaching into Boston Reports Am Bar Assoc Vol 34 pp 10924COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW The opinion in the Georgia case expressly declares that a bill of lading is not in the full sense a negotiable instrument31 and the court found no trouble in protecting the bona fide pledgee of such a bill against the owner of goods who had shipped them to his broker and sent to the latter the bill of lading endorsed in blank It will be seen that the case is anauthority for the original draft of this section and not for the propriety or need of the sec tion as redrawn The two cases from the Federal Reporter belong to the same class Both declare that bills of lading are not nego tiable instruments in the full sense that promissory notes are 32 but that when an owner of goods delivers to his agent an order bill of lading therefor indorsed in blank by such documentary evi dence he clothes such agent with the apparent absolute ownership of the goods and must bear the consequences of his act33 Three decisions are cited from Maryland and Louisiana based on statutes of those States declaring warehouse receipts and bills of lading negotiable to the same extent as bills of exchange and promissory notes The only point actually decided in the Mary land case34 is that one who takes an order bill of lading in payment of an antecedent debt becomes a purchaser and bona fide holder thereof for value and is entitled to the goods represented by it as against a defrauded vendor of the consignee The Louisiana cases35 refer to bills of lading as having been made by statute negotiable as commercial paper but in neither case did the rights of a bona fide purchaser from a thief or finder of the docu ment come in question nor did the court intimate that it would sustain such a title to the goods against that of the true owner The conclusions reached in these cases have been reached eIse where under nonnegotiable bills of lading36 and in jurisdictions which deny full negotiability to order bills37 Commercial Bank v Armsby Co I904 I20 Ga 74 76 3Pollard v Reardon 1895 65 Fed 848 Munroe v Phil Warehouse Co I896 75 Fed 545 Tiedeman v Knox r88o 53 Md 612 6i6 The court said The pres ent case does not require us to construe or give effect to this statute save in one or two particulars and does not raise the question presented in the case decided in the Supreme Court viz Shaw v Railroad Co I879 IOI U S 557 3Hardie v Vicksburg etc Ry I9o7 II8 La 254 The action was by one who had received the bill from the former owner of the goods after the latter had sold and delivered them to a third party and was against the railroad who had surrendered the goods without taking up the bill of lading Scheuermann v Monarch Fruit Co 19O9 123 La 55 38Bank of Bristol v Baltimore etc R R I904 99 Md 661 Chesa peake S S Co v Mierchants Bank I906 I02 Md 589 See cases cited in Williston Sales 729 730 128A REVIVAL OF CODIFICATION Moreover it has been held even in Maryland that one cannot take the property of another person either by intentional trespass or by mistake or without authority from the owner and by ware housing it or by shipping it under a bill of lading to his order and then endorsing the document of title to a bona fide purchaser for value divest the true owner of his title to such property8 So long as this remains the lawand section thirtytwo of the Bills of Lading Act seems to recognize its continuanceany attempt to make a bill of lading as fully negotiable as a bill of exchange is doomed to failure A boza fide holder of a valid negotiable bill or note owns not simply the document but the debt owing by prior parties to it As against him they are not permitted to dispute their liability Such paper is the obligation of the parties to it But a bill of lading is a symbol or representative of specific chattels a muniment of title to goods No statute has ever been enacted to the effect that the owner of chattels shall not be heard to assert his title to them even against a bona fide holder of a bill of lading for them provided such bill was taken out by a thief or finder of the goods or by one having no semblance of authority from the owner to ship them Nor has any court in England or this coun try ever recognized a mercantile usage to that effect Every bill of lading therefore must necessarily fall short of full negotiability A transferee takes it always at the risk of showing that the goods represented by it were the property of the shipper or that he had power to convey title to them It is incorrect to say that in the commercial world the bill of lading represents the goods and the owner thereof is considered to be the owner of them While the Act in question does not enable a thief of goods to transfer a perfect title to them as we have seen it does enable a thief of a bill of lading which is endorsed in blank by the owner of the goods to give a perfect title both to the document and the goods In so doing it seems to the writer to do without excuse what a learned English judge once said the law ought not to do to find facilities for enabling one man to steal another mans property The tendency towards Benthamistic codification above de scribed seems to accord with the views of a considerable part of the legal profession At least such appears to be the opinion ex pressed by a distinguished lawyer in the January number of this Seal v Zell  Sons 1884 63 Md 356 The same doctrine is stated and sustained by abundant authority in Williston Sales  416 421 129COLUMIBIA LAW REVIEW Review39 On the other hand not a few of the commissioners on Uniform State Laws who have voted in favor of reporting the bills herein referred to believe that these productions are not Benthamistic but have been kept quite within the lines drawn by Judge Chalmers and Lord Herschell This belief is expressed by the eminent President of the Conference of Commissioners in his Introduction to a pamphlet recently published containing the text of all these bills He writes Each of these Acts has had the most careful scrutiny and as a result it is believed that they represent the actual law upon all the subjects covered and where the law of the various States dif fers the weight of opinion is expressed in these Acts40 I venture to express the hope that every member of the bar will secure a copy of this pamphlet and make a careful study of its contents My inquiries lead me to believe that very few lawyers have become interested in the work of the Conference or have any knowledge of the bills resulting therefrom and of the changes which their legislative enactment will make in existing law FRANCIS M BURDICK COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY A

165 XXVI A LETTER FROM MR JAMES SHORT F R S TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF MACCLESFIELD PRESIDENT CONCERNING A PA PER OF THE LATE SERVINGTON SAVERY ESQ RELATING TO HIS INVENTION OF A NEW MICRO METER MY LORD IT IS NOW ABOVE A YEAR SINCE I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE REV F PEZENAS PROFESSOR OF HYDROGRAPHY TO THE FRENCH KING AT MAR SEILLES IN WHICH HE INFORMED ME THAT M BOUGUER HAD READ BEFORE THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT PARIS IN THE YEAR 1748 A MEMOIR IN WHICH HE DE SCRIBES AN HELIOMETER WHICH IS AN INSTRUMENT CON SISTING OF TWO OBJECTIVE GLASSES FOR MEASURING THE DIA METERS OF THE PLANETS HE SAID ALSO THAT THIS MEMOIR WAS ACTUALLY IN THE HANDS OF M DE FOUCHY PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF THE ACADEMY OR AT THE ROYAL PRINTING HOUSE AND THAT IT WAS REGISTERD IN THE MINUTES OF THE ACADEMY FOR THE YEAR 1748 READ MAY 10 1753 IMMEDIATELY AFTER READING THIS LETTER I RECOLLECTED TO HAVE HEARD A PAPER UPON THE SAME SUBJECT FROM THE LATE SERVINGTON SAVERY OF EXETER ESQ READ BE FORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY ABOUT THE YEAR 1743 I THERE FORE HAD RECOURSE TO THE MINUTEBOOK OF THE SOCIETY FOR THAT YEAR WHERE I FOUND THE FOLLOWING MINUTE WHICH I COPIED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE RIGHT HONOUR ABLE THE LORD CHARLES CAVENDISH THEN VICEPRE SIDENT  A166  A PAPER COMMUNICATED FROM MR SAVERY AT  EXON CONTAINING A NEW METHOD FOR MEASUR  ING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APOGEAL AND  PERIGEAL DIAMETERS OF THE SUN WAS SHEWN AND  THANKS BEING ORDERED DR BRADLEY WAS DE  SIRED TO OBLIGE THE SOCIETY WITH AN ACCOUNT OF  ITS CONTENTS  OCTOB 27 1743 UPON MENTIONING LAST YEAR THE WHOLE OF WHAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED TO YOU YOUR LORDSHIP WAS PLEASED TO PROMISE TO SPEAK TO DR BRADLEY WHO WAS THEN IN OXFORDSHIRE CONCERNING THIS PAPER OF MR SAVERY IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH I ABOUT THE END OF LAST MAY RECEIVED THE ORIGINAL PAPER OF MR SAVERY FROM THE DOCTORS HANDS THE VOLUME OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY FOR THE YEAR 1748 BEING NOW PUBLISHED I HAVE FOUND THAT F PEZENASS INFORMATION WAS JUST AND THEREFORE I HAVE SENT INCLOSED TO YOUR LORDSHIP AS PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE ORIGINAL PAPER OF MR SAVERY WHICH IF YOUR LORDSHIP THINKS PROPER MAY BE RE TURNED TO THE SOCIETY YOUR LORDSHIP WILL OBSERVE UPON THE BACK OF THE ORIGINAL PAPER OF MR SAVERY A MEMORANDUM IN THE HANDWRITING OF OUR LATE WORTHY PRESIDENT MARTIN FOLKES ESQ AS A FURTHER PROOF OF ITS AUTHENTICITY WHICH RUNS IN THESE WORDS  DELIVERED TO ME BY MR GRANAM SEALED UP  BY THE AUTHOR AND THEN BROKE OPEN IN HIS  PRESENCE  26 OCT 1743  M FOLKES I HAVE LIKEWISE MY LORD IN MY HANDS AN ORIGI NAL LETTER OF MR SAVERY TO THE LATE MR GEO GRAHAM 6 UPON167 UPON THE SAME SUBJECT DATED NOV 30 1743 AND A COPY OF THIS LETTER SHALL BE DELIVERED IF COMMANDED BY THE SOCIETY AS A FARTHER PROOF OF THE AUTHENTICITY OF MR SAVERYS PAPER I AM MY LORD YOUR LORDSHIPS MOST OBEDIENT SURREYSTREET MAY 10 1753 AND MOST HUMBLE SERVANT JAMES SHORT A NEW WAY OF MEASURING THE DIFFERENCE BE TWEEN THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF THE SUN AT THE TIMES OF THE EARTHS PERIHELION AND APHELION OR WHEN THE SUN IS NEARER TO OR FARTHER FROM THE EARTH WITH A MICROME TER PLACED IN A TELESCOPE INVENTED FOR THAT PURPOSE THO THE CHARGE OR MAGNIFYING POWER OF THE TELESCOPE IS SO GREAT THAT THE WHOLE SUNS DIAMETER DOES NOT APPEAR THEREIN AT ONE VIEW BY SERVINGTON SAVERY OF EXETER ESQ MENTIOND IN MR SHORTS PRE CEDING LETTER THIS I DOUBT NOT WILL AT FIRST SIGHT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE SINCE ONLY A PART OF THE DIAMETER APPEARS AND NO VISIBLE MARK OR POINT THEREIN FROM WHICH SUCH MEASURE CAN BE TAKEN AND INDEED IT IS SO BY OBSERVATIONS WITH OUR COMMON TELE SCOPES WHETHER DIOPTRIC OR REFLECTING ONES I HAVE READ OCT 27 1743168 I HAVE THEREFORE CONTRIVED SOME DIOPTRIC TELESCOPES AND A REFLECTING ONE EITHER OF WHICH BY REPRESENT ING THE OBJECT DOUBLE WILL IF WELL MADE ANSWER THE DESIGN FIG 1 REPRESENTS THE WHOLE BODY OF THE SUN AS IT APPEARS DOUBLE AND MAGNIFIED IN THE TELESCOPE LET A N BE THE DIAMETER OF THE ONE AND R X OF THE OTHER IMAGE OF THE SUN IN PERIGAEO SO SHALL N R BE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO IMAGES AT THAT TIME WHICH MEASURED WITH THE MICROMETER IS EQUAL TO SUPPOSE 10 SECONDS LET B M BE THE DIAMETER OF THE ONE SOLAR IMAGE AND S W OF THE OTHER WHEN IN APOGAEO SO SHALL M S BE THE THEN DISTANCE OF THE SOLAR IMAGES MEASURING WITH THE MICROMETER SUPPOSE I MINUTE 10 SECONDS THE DIF FERENCE OF THESE TWO OBSERVATIONS 1 MINUTE IS THE APPARENT DIMINUTION OF THE SUNS DIAMETER THE LITTLE CIRCLE WHOSE DIAMETER IS D T IS THE WHOLE AREA VISIBLE AT ONCE IN THE TELESCOPE WHICH IS NOT ONE THIRD PART OF THE MAGNIFIED DIAMETER OF THE SUN BUT SINCE BOTH N R AT ONE TIME AND M S AT ANOTHER TIME ARE VISIBLE WITHIN THE TELESCOPES AREA IF GOOD INSTRU MENTS ARE PROCURED I CAN SEE NO DIFFICULTY IN PERFORM ING WHAT I HAVE PROPOSED ABOVE MORE ACCURATELY THAN IT HAS EVER YET BEEN DONE EXCEPT THIS ONE WHICH SOME TIME SINCE MR GRAHAM IN A LETTER TO ME MEN TIOND VIZ THAT OF DEFINING THE SUNS DISK TRULY AND I THINK TO DO THAT TO GOOD PERFECTION IS BEYOND HU MAN ART A TELESCOPE FOR THIS USE MAY BE MADE TO MAGNIFY THE SUNS DIAMETER TO ANY DEGREE WHATSOEVER NOT EXCEEDING SUCH DEGREE AS WILL MAKE ANY PART OF THE LINE M S FALL WITHOUT THE AREA OF THE TELESCOPE AND I THINK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE ONE WITH A CHARGE173 A CHARGE SO GREAT AS NOT TO HAVE MORE THAN A GEOME TRICAL MINUTE OF THE SUNS APPARENT DIAMETER VISIBLE AT ONCE SINCE THE SUN IS AN OBJECT SO VERY REMOTE THE PEN CIL OF RAYS FLOWING FROM THE CENTER OF ITS DISK AND INCIDENT ALL OVER AN OBJECTLENS THO IT SHOULD BE A FOOT BROAD WOULD NOT DIFFER SENSIBLY FROM A PERFECT CYLINDER WITHIN THE DISTANCE OF ABOVE 100 MILES FROM ITS BASIS AT THE LENS THO IN REALITY THE WHOLE PENCIL IS AN ACUTE CONE WHOSE ANGLE AT THE VERTEX IS ALMOST EVANESCENT HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT IF THE TWO POLES OF TWO EQUAL OBJECTGLASSES ARE PLACED AT THE DISTANCE SUPPOSE OF A FOOT FROM ONE ANOTHER THE TWO CENTERS C V OF THE TWO SOLAR IMAGES MUST AS TO SENSE REMAIN ALWAYS AT THAT VERY SAME DISTANCE VIZ 1 FOOT FROM ONE ANOTHER THO THE SUN SHOULD BE PLACED TEN TIMES AS FAR OFF AS IT NOW IS BUT SINCE THE SUNS GREATER DISTANCE WOULD DIMINISH THE DIAMETERS OF BOTH OF THE SOLAR IMAGES M N ADDED TO R S MUST BE THE TRUE DIFFERENCE OF THE APPARENT DIA METERS OF THE IMAGES AND ALSO OF THE SUN AT DIF FERENT TIMES ACCORDING TO MR AZOUT HARRISS LEXIC TECHN VOL I SEE SUN THE APPARENT DIAMETER OF THE SUN NEVER EXCEEDS 32 45 WHENCE ITS RADIUS NEVER EX CEEDS 16 22 30 THE TANGENT WHEREOF IS ABOUT 476328 IF I MISTAKE NOT TO THE RADIUS 100000000 AS THE SAID TANGENT TO THE SAID RADIUS SO HALF AN INCH TO 04 96 INCHES AND DECIMAL PARTS ACCORDING TO THIS IF THE FOCAL LENGTH OF A LENS IS 10496 INCHES AND PARTS IT CANNOT COLLECT THE SUNS RAYS TO A LESS FOCUS Y AT170 AT THE TIME OF HIS PERIGEE THAN ONE INCH IN DIAMETER OR HALF AN INCH RADIUS FIG 2 THE WHOLE CIRCLE REPRESENTS A WELLCENTERD OBJECT LENS WHOSE FOCAL LENGTH IS AS ABOVE CALCULATED 10496 INCHES AND PARTS RATHER A LITTLE LESS THAT THE TWO IMAGES MAY BE SURE NOT TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER LET THE TWO DIAMETERS D M QF DIVIDE IT INTO FOUR QUADRANTS BUT THE DIAMETER Q F MUST BE OCCULT OR DELIBLE LET C W BE HALF AN INCH AND C V EQUAL TO IT THROUGH V AND ALSO THRO W LET A CHORDLINE BE DRAWN PARALLEL TO THE DIAMETER D M VIZ B G H P THRO THE SAID CHORDLINES B G AND H P AND ALSO THRO THE DIAMETER D M DIVIDE THE LENS INTO FOUR PARTS FIG 3 LET THE STRAIT EDGE OF THE FRUSTUM B V G Q IN THE PRECEDING FIGURE BE CEMENTED FAST TO THAT OF THE SIMI LAR FRUSTUM B W P F OF THE SAME LENS AS THEY APPEAR IN THIS PRESENT FIG 3 WHEREIN FOR THE EASIER UNDER STANDING THE PLACING THEM I HAVE NOTED EACH FRUSTUM WITH THE SAME LETTERS IT WAS NOTED WITHAL IN THE PRE CEDING FIG 2 HAVING THEN WITH BARM FASTENED A WHITE PAPER ALL OVER BOTH SIDES OF THE LENS I MADE FOR TRIAL WHICH I DID NOT ONLY TO SECURE THE CEMENTED JOINT FROM BREAKING BUT TO PREVENT THE INJURY WHICH THE POLISH MIGHT RECEIVE IN CUTTING AND GRINDING THE EDGES I DESCRIBED A CIRCLE Q M N F ON THE CENTER C FIT FOR THE TUBE I HAD TO PUT IN IT AND HAVING MADE IT ROUND AND WASHD IT CLEAN AFTER THE EDGES WERE GROUND TRUE THAT NOTHING SANDY MIGHT HURT THE POLISH I SOAKD IT IN CLEAN WATER TILL I COULD EASILY TAKE OFF THE171 THE PAPER I ALSO BEFORE I TOOK OFF THE PAPER MARKD ONE END OF EACH FRUSTUM IN THE EDGE AT M AND N THAT IF THEY FELL ASUNDER THEY MIGHT BE CE MENTED TOGETHER AGAIN THE SAME WAY THIS MODEL MADE OF A SPECTACLEGLASS ABOUT 12 OR 13 INCHES FO CUS GAVE ME ENCOURAGEMENT TO TRY THE FOLLOWING ONE WHICH I THOUGHT BETTER FIG 4 I MADE MY SECOND MODEL OFTHE TWO MIDDLE FRUS TUMS M C D H W P M C D B V G OF THE LENS FIG 2 BY CEMENTING THEIR EDGES H W P B V G TOGETHER AS THEY ARE PLACED IN THE PRESENT FIG 4 SO THE POLE C OF EACH PART MUST CONSEQUENTLY BE HALF AN INCH SUPPOSING ITS FOCAL LENGTH IS ABOUT 104 INCHES FROM THE MIDDLE WHERE C STOOD IN FIG 2 VIZ THE POLE OF ONE FRUS TUM WHERE V AND OF THE OTHER WHERE W NOW STANDS I LEFT OPEN AT EACH POLE A SEMICIRCULAR APERTURE R W Q S V T ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF AN INCH DIAMETER AND CO VERD ALL THE REST OF THE CIRCLE A X L K Z O TO WHICH I HAD CUT IT FIT FOR THE TUBE THE FOCUS OF THE LENS I MADE IT OF WAS ABOUT 3 FEET NOTE THE RAYS OF RED LIGHT IN THE TWO SOLAR IMAGES WILL BE NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER IN BOTH THESE MODELS WHICH I TAKE IT WILL RENDER THE SUNS DISK MORE EASY TO BE OBSERVED THAN THE VIOLET ONES THIS I MENTION BECAUSE THE GLASSES IN THESE TWO SORTS ARE SOMEWHAT PRISMATICAL BUT MOSTLY THOSE OF MY FIRST MODEL WHICH COULD THEREFORE BEAR NO GREAT CHARGE ALSO THE FRUSTUM ON THE RIGHTHAND OF MY FIRST MO DEL RENDERS THE SOLAR IMAGE AT THE FOCUS ON THE LEFT AND THAT ON THE LEFTHAND RENDERS IT ON THE RIGHT BUT IT IS NOT SO WITH THE SECOND MODEL OR WITH THE NEXT CONTRIVANCE WHICH IS THE BEST IF WELL MADE Y 2 FIG176 FIG 5 IN THIS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY CONSISTS IN GETTING TWO WELLCENTERD OBJECTGLASSES WHOSE FOCAL LENGTHS ARE EQUAL FOR IT IS NECESSARY THEY SHOULD BE SO BECAUSE THEY ARE TO BE COMBINED WITH THE SAME CONVEX EYE LENS COMMON TO THEM AT THE SAME DISTANCE A B IS THE DIAMETER OF A PLAIN BRASS PLATE WHICH MAY BE TWO INCHES AND A HALF BROAD OR SOMEWHAT LESS TWO SHORT EQUAL CYLINDRIC BRASS TUBES M N R S MUST BE FASTENED THEREON WITH THEIR CENTERS P C EQUIDISTANT FROM THE CENTER L OF THE PLATE AND DISTANT ONE INCH FROM ONE ANOTHER IN THE DIAMETER A B AS THE FIGURE SHEWETH IN THE TUBES MUST BE PUT TWO EQUAL OBJECT GLASSES OF THE FOCAL LENGTH OF 104910 INCHES OR RATHER SOMEWHAT LESS AS AFORESAID THROUGH THE PLATE THERE MUST BE MADE IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH TUBE A ROUND APERTURE VIZ H G W X WHOSE DIAMETERS MUST BE PROPORTIOND TO THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE EYELENS AND NOT EXCEED THE THIRD PART THEREOF LEST THE OBJECT APPEAR CONFUSED AND SINCE IT IS SCARCE POSSIBLE TO CENTER AN OBJECT LENS TO VERY GOOD PERFECTION THOSE IN THE TWO CYLIN DERS THO PUT IN BY A GOOD ARTIST MAY HAPPEN TO REN DER THE TWO SOLAR IMAGES AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE FROM OR TOO NEAR TO ONE ANOTHER BUT THIS FAULT IF NOT TOO GREAT MAY BE REMEDIED BY TURNING ONE OR BOTH OF THE LENSS A LITTLE WAY ROUND AND THEN THEIR ECCEN TRIC POLES WILL BY THAT MEANS BE BROUGHT NEARER TO OR FURTHER FROM ONE ANOTHER AND WHEN THEY ARE ONCE WELL PLACD THERE SHOULD BE A MARK MADE IN EACH LENS AND ITS CYLINDER THAT IF IT IS TAKEN OUT TO BE WIPED IT MAY BE PUT IN AGAIN THE SAME WAY THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A DIFFERENT MARK IN ONE OF 6 THE177 THE GLASSES THAT EACH MAY KNOW ITS OWN CYLINDER THEY MUST BOTH OF THEM BE VERY CLOSE ALL ROUND TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CYLINDERS OTHERWISE ONE LENS MAY SLIDE NEARER TO OR FURTHER FROM THE OTHER WHICH IF IT SHOULD IN THE LEAST DEGREE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SE COND OBSERVATION ALL THE LABOUR WOULD BE LOST EITHER OF THESE THREE PARTS OF DOUBLE LENSS MAY BE COMBINED WITH A CONVEX EYELENS AS USUAL AND HAVE A MICROMETER PLACED AT THE COMMON FOCUS SUCH A DOUBLE LENS OF EITHER SORT MAY BE PROVED WHETHER IT IS WELL COMPOSED OR NOT WITHOUT THE TROUBLE OF COMBINING IT WITH ITS EYELENS BY HOLDING IT IN THE SUNS RAYS AS ONE WOULD A BURNING GLASS AND APPLYING A PIECE OF WHITE PAPER AT ITS FOCUS WHERE I APPREHEND THE TWO SOLAR IMAGES WILL APPEAR AS DISTINCT AS WHEN AN EYELENS IS APPLIED THO NOT SO LARGE AND EACH OF THEM ONE INCH BROAD IF THE FO CAL LENGTH IS AS ABOVE I E ALMOST 104910 INCHES AFTER THE SAME MANNER MAY THE DOUBLE OBJECT MIRROR OF A REFLECTING TELESCOPE FOR THIS USE BE PROVED FIG 6 THE CIRCLE B D H P M G IS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CON CAVE MIRROR MADE OF BLACK GLASS IT MUST BE VERY THICK THAT IT MAY NOT SPRING OR BEND WITH ANY THING THAT PRESSETH ON IT TO KEEP IT FAST FOR THAT MAY IN JURE THE CONCAVITY OF IT THE CIRCLE WITHIN IT ON THE SAME CENTER C SHEWETH THAT THE CONCAVITY THEREOF MUST NOT BE CONTINUED QUITE HOME TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE MIRROR BUT THE LITTLE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO CIRCLES MUST BE GROUND VERY TRUE ON A PLAIN THE PRICKD LINES MUST NOT BE DRAWN THEY ARE ONLY TO INDICATE WHERE THE POLES V W174 V W OF THE TWO FRUSTUMS MUST BE BROUGHT AFTER THE MIRROR IS DIAMETRICALLY BISECTED LET THE CONCAVE SIDE BE DEFENDED BY PASTING A PAPER ALL OVER IT AND THEN LET IT BE DIVIDED WITH A SAW IN THE DIAMETER D C M TAKING CARE THAT THE SAID DIAMETER BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KERF WHICH MAY BE AS BROAD AS THE SPACE BETWEEN THE LINES A O E Q LET THE ASPERITIES OF THE EDGES OF BOTH FRUSTUMS BE GROUND OFF THAT THEY MAY BE VERY STRAIT AFTER THEIR BEING SAWN FIG 7 REPRESENTS A THICK ROUND PLATE OF BRASS VERY PLAIN AND EQUALLY THICK ALL OVER HAVING LINES DRAWN ON IT AS ON FIG 2 ALSO ONE LINE ON EACH SIDE OF THE DIAME TER D M EQUIDISTANT FROM IT AND PARALLEL THERETO THE DISTANCE OF THESE TWO LINES A O E Q FROM ONE ANOTHER EQUAL TO THE KERF OF THE SAW WHICH DIVIDED THE MIRROR THE DIAMETER OF THIS PLATE MUST BE EQUAL TO THAT OF THE MIRROR BEFORE IT WAS DIVIDED ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE PLATE MUST BE TWO PINS FASTENED THERETO T T THEIR DIAMETERS EQUAL TO THE KERF OF THE SAW THAT THEY MAY KEEP THE TWO FRUSTUMS OF THE MIRROR AT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER THAT THEY WERE BEFORE THEIR DIVISION SO SHALL THEIR CIRCULAR EDGES BE EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE CIRCUMSE RENCE OF THE PLATE AND THEIR STRAIT EDGES TOUCH THE SAID PINS IN THE LINES A O E Q THE END OF THE TUBE MUST BE TURND ON THE INSIDE EXACTLY TO FIT THE PLATE AND MIRROR THAT THEY MAY NOT SLIDE ANY WAY FOR THAT WOULD SPOIL THE OBSERVA TIONS IN THE DIAMETER OF THE PLATE R S ON THE POINTS V W DISTANT HALF AN INCH FROM C THE CENTER OF THE PLATE AND175 AND A WHOLE INCH FROM EACH OTHER LET A CIRCLE FOR THE APERTURE OF EACH FRUSTUM OF A PROPER SIZE AC CORDING TO THE INTENDED CHARGE OF THE TELESCOPE BE DESCRIBED AND CUT OUT ALSO IN THE SAID DIAMETER EQUIDISTANT FROM THE CENTER C VIZ AT X AND Z LET THERE BE A SCREW FOR EACH FRUSTUM TO ELEVATE IT A LITTLE FROM THE PLATE AS SHALL BE NEEDFUL LET THERE BE A SPRING CONTRIVED TO PRESS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE ONE FRUSTUM O R A AGAINST THE POINT V BEING THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE EDGE A O AND THE SCREW X TO KEEP THE FRUSTUM CLOSE TO THE PLATE AT THE POINTS A O AND ALSO CLOSE TO THE SCREW X WHEN IT IS SCREWD IN LET THE LIKE BE ALSO DONE ON THE BACK OF THE OTHER FRUSTUM E S Q I SAY THEN 1 THAT BEFORE THE TWO SCREWS ARE PUT IN AT X Z THE TWO FRUSTUMS OF THE MIRROR WILL LIE PLAIN ON THE PLATE OF BRASS AND HAVE ONE POLE AT C COMMON TO THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY WILL COLLECT ALL RAYS WHICH DURING THEIR INCIDENCE ARE PARALLEL TO THE AXIS OF THE TUBE TO ONE COMMON FOCUS IN THE SAID AXIS OF THE TUBE JUST AS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE BEFORE THE MIRROR WAS DIVIDED 2 BUT WHEN THE TWO SCREWS X Z ARE PUT IN THEIR PLACES AND SCREWD A LITTLE WAY THROUGH THE BRASS PLATE THEY WILL LIFT THE TWO FRUSTUMS FREE FROM THE PLATE AT THEIR CIRCULAR EDGES VIZ AT R AND S WHILE THEIR STRAIT EDGES A O E Q ARE KEPT TO TOUCH THE PLATE WITH BOTH THEIR ENDS NOT IN THE MIDDLE BY REASON OF THE MIRRORS CONCAVITY BY THE PRESSURE OF THE SPRINGS AS WAS MENTIOND ABOVE BY THIS MEANS THE POLE C OF THE FRUSTUM O R A WILL BE REMOVED FROM C TOWARD180 TOWARD R AND LIKEWISE THE POLE C OF THE OTHER FRUS TUM E S Q BE REMOVED FROM C TOWARDS S MORE OR LESS ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITY OF THE ELEVATION OF EACH FRUSTUM BY THE SCREW THAT RAISETH IT SO THAT NOW THERE WILL APPEAR AT THE FOCUS TWO SOLAR IMAGES WHEREAS THERE WAS BUT ONE BEFORE THE SCREWS WERE PUT IN BY MOVING THE SCREWS THE TWO SOLAR IMAGES MAY BE BROUGHT TO ANY DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER BUT CARE MUST BE TAKEN NOT TO RAISE ONE FRUSTUM MORE THAN THE OTHER AND THE TWO SOLAR IMAGES MUST ALMOST TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AT THE TIME OF THE PERIGEE OTHER WISE IT MUST BE BETTER ADJUSTED THIS TELESCOPE MAY BE FINISHED WITH A SMALL EL LIPTICAL SPECILLUM OF BLACK GLASS GROUND PLAIN ON ITS REFLECTING SURFACE AND A CONVEX EYELENS LIKE THAT DESCRIBED BY J HADLEY ESQ F R S IN PHIL TRANS N 376 A MICROMETER MAY BE CONTRIVED FOR IT AT THE COMMON FOCUS NEAR THE EYELENS SUCH A DOUBLE OBJECTSPECULUM WOULD BE CAPABLE OF A VAST IMPROVEMENT BY COMBINING IT WITH A CON CAVE SPECILLUM WHICH WOULD REFLECT THE IMAGES THRO A HOLE IN THE CENTER C OF THE SAID SPECULUM TO FALL ON A CONVEX EYELENS AFTER THE MANNER OF OUR NEW SORT OF REFLECTING TELESCOPES WAS IT NOT FOR THE DIFFICULTY OF ADAPTING SUCH A MICROMETER TO IT AS WOULD EXACTLY MEASURE MINUTES AND SECONDS FOR THE EYEGLASSES OF SUCH HAVING USUALLY A PRETTY LERG FOCAL LENGTH WOULD BEAR MUCH LARGER DIVISIONS ON A MICROMETER THAN MR HADLEYS WITH A SMALL EYEGLASS CAN DO THO THEIR CHARGES SHOULD BE EQUAL OR THAT OF THE FORMER DID EXCEED I FIND THAT LARGE OBJECTGLASSES FOR TELESCOPES ARE NOT COMMONLY WELL CENTERD WITH THEIR POLES IN THE VERY MIDDLE177 MIDDLE OF THEM I SENT FOR TWO TO LONDON BOTH OF WHICH WERE FAULTY I THEREFORE RETURND THEM AND HAD TWO SENT ME AGAIN AS ECCENTRIC WELL NIGH AS THE FORMER ONES HARRISS LEXICON TECHN VOL I SEE OPTICS GIVES A RULE FOR CENTERING OPTICGLASSES BUT I THINK THE FOL LOWING MAY BE MORE SURE AND HANDY FOR A GLASS GRINDERS USE AND SOON TRY WHETHER A CONVEX LENS IS WELL CENTERD FIG 8 REPRESENTS A ROUND PLATE OF BRASS CONVENIENTLY THICK AND WELL HARDEND BY HAMMERING WERE IT NOT FOR THE RUST HARDEND STEEL WOULD BE BETTER HAV ING MANY NOTCHES ROUND IT ONE A LITTLE WIDER THAN THAT WHICH IS NEXT TO IT AND NUMBERD 1 2 3 C IN THEIR PROPER ORDER EACH OF THEM WIDER AT THE BOT TOM THAN AT THE ENTRANCE I FITTED SUCH A NOTCH TO THE THICKEST SIDE OF ONE OF THE GLASSES I HAD FROM LONDON SO AS THE EDGE ENTERD IT BUT A LITTLE WAY NOT HALF THE DEPTH THEREOF BUT ON TRYING THE OP POSITE SIDE IT WENT IN THE WHOLE DEPTH THEREOF AND WOULD HAVE GONE DEEPER IF THE NOTCH HAD BEEN SO CUT I THEN GROUND THE LENS NARROWER ON THAT SIDE WHICH WAS THINNEST UNTIL I FOUND IT WAS AT THAT PLACE AS THICK AS WHERE I FIRST TRYD IT IN THE NOTCH AFTER THIS MANNER I REDUCD THE GLASS TO AN EQUAL THICKNESS ON ITS FOUR QUARTERS AND THEN GROUND OFF FROM OTHER PLACES WHAT WAS NEEDFUL TO BRING IT CIR CULAR I ALSO TOOK CARE WHEN I TRIED IT IN THE NOTCH THAT THE LENS SHOULD NOT BE WARMER ON THE ONE SIDE THAN ON THE OTHER BY GRINDING BUT TARRIED TILL I THOUGHT IT THROUGHLY COLD AND WAS ALSO CAREFUL NOT TO THRUST IT IN HARDER ON THE ONE SIDE THAN ON THE Z OPPOSITE178 OPPOSITE SIDE FOR I COULD PLAINLY OBSERVE A DIFFERENCE AFTERWARD IF I NEGLECTED TO MIND BOTH THESE CIRCUM STANCES OR INDEED EITHER OF THEM

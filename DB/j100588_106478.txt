S,i206938,15 III Conclusion of the Experiments and Observations concerning the Attractive Powers of the Mineral Acids By Richard Kir wan Esq F R S Read Dec 12 1782 HAVING found as exactly as I was able the quantity of each of the mineral acids taken up at the point of satu ration by alkalies and earths and also that taken up by phlo giston when these acids are by it converted into an aerial form I next endeavoured to find how much of these acids was taken up at the point of saturation by each of the metallic substances and for this purpose procured the most saturated solution possi ble of each metallic substance soluble in any of these acids These solutions did not indeed immediately answer my pur pose as they constantly retained an excess of acid yet as they were the foundation of my subsequent observations and as the experiments themselves are in many respects useful to be known I shall here briefly relate their result and confine myself to those circumstances singly that relate to my future investiga tions or that have not heretofore been satisfactorily explained The acids I used were dephlogisticated so far as to be colourless the metals were for the most part very fine filings or reduced in a mortar to a fine powder They were added little by little to their respective menstruums much more being thus dissolved than if the whole was thrown in at once and the solution was performed in glass phials with bent tubes Solution16 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations concerning Solution of iron in the vitriolic acid 100 grs of bariron in the temperature of 56 require for their solution 190 grs of real acid whose proportion to that of the water with which it should be diluted is as 1 to 8 10 or 12 It would act on iron though its proportion were greater or lesser but not so vigourously If towards the end a heat of 200 were applied 123 grs of real acid would be sufficient The air produced by this solution is intirely inflammable and generally amounts to 155 cubic inches Iron is also soluble with the assistance of a strong heat and in smaller quantity in concentrated vitriolic acid and in this case scarce any inflammable air is produced but a large quan tity of vitriolic air as Dr PRIESTLEY has observed and a small quantity of sulphur sublimes at the latter end This fact is a clear refutation of Mr LAVOISIERS hypothesis for is it not evident that the same substance which when a dilute acid is used goes off in the form of inflammable air does when a concentrated acid is used to unite this acid and thus form both vitriolic air and sulphur In the first case it cannot unite to the acid by reason of the large quantity of water combined with the acid and as the liquor being mostly aqueous contains a large quantity of specific fire it receives that fire when the acid unites to the metallic earth and flies off in the form of air But in the second case the concentrated acid containing much less specific fire can not expel the phlogiston in the form of inflammable air as this air absorbs a vast quantity of fire but unites to it when by heat it is further stripped of its water and thus forms both 100the Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 17 vitriolic air and sulphur 100 grs of iron dissolved without heat afford upwards of 400 of vitriol 100 grs of the vitriol crystallized contain 25 of iron 20 of real acid and 55 of water When calcined nearly to redness these crystals lose about 40 of water The calces of iron are more or less soluble in this acid according to their degree of dephlogistication Those that are phlogisticated as that recently precipitated from a solution of vitriol by fixed alkalies are also most soluble and upon eva poration afford crystals though paler than those formed of ge nuine iron Those that are least phlogisticated are also least soluble that is require more real acid for their solution and afford no crystals but only a magma or mother liquor Hence also solutions of iron newly made diminish and consequently phlogisticate the superincumbent air and consequently gra dually emit phlogiston and hence the calx being more de phlogisticated gradually falls unless more acid be added to keep it in solution Iron in the nitrous acid 100 grs of iron to be perfectly dissolved and not barely calcined require 142 grs of real nitrous acid so diluted as that its proportion to water should be as 1 to 13 or 14 and when this last proportion is used the heat of a candle may be applied for a few seconds and the access of common air pre vented In this case not above 18 cubic inches of nitrous air are produced all the rest is absorbed by the solution and no red vapours appear But if the proportion of acid and water be as 1 to 8 or 10 and heat be applied a much greater quantity of iron will be dephlogisticated though very little of it be held in solution and by this means I have obtained from 100 grs of iron 8387 cubic inches VOL LXXIII D of18 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on of nitrous air and by distilling the solution a still greater quantity may be obtained which was absorbed by the solution No inflammable air is obtained from solutions of iron or any other metallic substance in the nitrous acid because this acid has less affinity to water and more to phlogiston than the vitriolic acid and also contains much less fire than either the vitriolic or marine acids as will be seen in the sequel and therefore unites to phlogiston instead of barely expelling it And hence it is that the vitriolic acid though united with 30 times its weight of water will still visibly act on iron and sepa rate inflammable air in the temperature of 55 whereas nitrous acid diluted with 15 times its weight of water will have no visible effect on iron in that temperature The calces of iron if not too much dephlogisticated are also soluble though difficulty in the nitrous acid Iron in the marine acid 100 grs of iron require 215 of real marine acid for their solution The proportion of acid to that of water in the spirit of salt I used was as 1 to 4 When it is as 1 to 4 it effervesces too violently Heat is rather prejudicial as it volatilises the acid No marine air flies off and the quantity of inflammable air is just the same as if dilute vitriolic acid were used The calces of iron are also soluble in marine acid They may be distinguished from genuine iron in this that their colour when precipitated by fixed alkalies is reddish whereas the precipitate of genuine iron is greenish Copper in the vitriolic acid 100 grs of copper require nearly 183 grs real vitriolic acid for their solution The proportion of acid to that of water 4 beingthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 19 being as 1 to 12 or at least as 1 to 710 and a strong heat must also be applied I could never dissolve the whole of any quan tity of copper but to dissolve a given quantity of it a still greater must be used in the proportion of nearly 28 to 100 though this residuum also is soluble by adding more acid When copper has been dephlogisticated in this manner a solu tion of it is obtained by adding warm water to the dephlogisti cated mass The dephlogistication of 128 grs of copper treated in this manner affords 11 cubic inches of inflammable air and nearly 65 of vitriolic air When I obtained inflammable the acid was a little more aqueous The reason why copper cannot be dephlo gisticated by dilute vitriolic acid nor even by the concentrated without the assistance of a strong heat as iron is appears deriveable from its much stronger attraction to phlogiston and the much greater quantity of it which copper contains as will hereafter be seen Hence 100 grs of vitriol of copper contain 27 of copper 30 of acid and 43 of water of which it loses about 28 by evapora tion or slight calcination The solution of 100 grs of copper affords 373 of blue vitriol Copper in nitrous acid 100 grs of copper require 130 of real nitrous acid to dissolve them If the acid be so far diluted as that its proportion to that of water be as 1 to 14 the assistance of heat will be neces sary otherwise not This solution affords 6712 cubic inches of nitrous air The calces of copper are also soluble in this acid D 2 Copper20 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on Copper in marine acid 100 grs of copper require 1190 grs of real marine acid to dissolve them and also the assistance of a moderate heat the proportion of acid to that of water being as 1 to 413 that is its specific gravity being 1186 if a greater heat be used more of the acid will be requisite as much will be dissipated If the acid be more concentrated it will act more vigorously In my last paper I mentioned that 812 grs of copper afforded 86 of marine air however I must now add a circumstance which I then did not attend to which is that the mercury over which that air was received was acted upon so that part of the air was due to this action which invalidates the conclusion I there drew concerning the quantity of phlogiston in marine air which hence appears to be greater than I there estimated it The calces of copper are also soluble in this acid though not so easily as in the nitrous acid Tin in the vitriolic acid 100 grs of tin require for their perfect solution 872 grs of real vitriolic acid whose proportion to water should not be less than as 1 to 910 and also the assistance of a strong heat when the action of the acid has ceased some hot water should be added to the turbid solution and the whole again heated This solution affords 70 cubic inches of inflammable air Tin is also soluble in a more dilute acid but not in so great quantity The calces of tin except that precipitated from marine acid by fixed alkalies are insoluble in this acid Tinthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 21 Tin in the nitrous acid 100 grs of tin require for their perfect solution 1200 grs of real nitrous acid whose proportion to water should be at least as 1 to 25 and the heat not exceeding 60 the quantity of air afforded by such solution is only ten cubic inches and it is not nitrous The solution is not permanent for in a few days it deposits a whitish calx and if the weather be warm bursts the phial The calces of tin are insoluble in this acid Tin in the marine acid 100 grs of tin require for their solution 413 of real marine acid whose proportion to water is as 1 to 412 and also the assistance of a moderate heat This solution affords about 90 cubic inches of inflammable air and 10 of marine air The calces of tin are nearly insoluble in this acid Lead in the vitriolic acid 100 grs of lead require for their solution 600 grs of real acid whose proportion to water is not less than that of 1 to 710 and better if the quantity of water be still less and hence as with regard to copper a greater quantity of lead should be employed than is expected to be dissolved A strong heat is also requisite and hot water should be added to the cal cined mass though sparingly as it occasions some precipita tion This metal is also soluble but in a very small degree in dilute vitriolic acid for it effervesces with spirit of vitriol whose specific gravity is only 1275 The22 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on The calces of lead are something more soluble in this acid 100 grs of vitriol of lead formed by precipitation contains 73 of lead 17 of real acid and 10 of water Vitriol of lead formed by direct solution contains a large proportion of acid Lead in the nitrous acid 100 grs of lead require for their solution about 78 grs of real acid whose proportion to that of water may be as 1 to 11 or 12 and the assistance of heat towards the end This solu tion affords but eight cubic inches of nitrous air The calces of lead are also soluble in this acid but if much dephlogisti cated they become less soluble 100 grs of minium require 81 grs of real acid 100 grs of nitrous salt of lead contain about 60 of lead Lead in the marine acid 100 grs of lead require 600 grs of real acid to dissolve them when the specific gravity of the spirit of salt is 1141 and also the assistance of heat by which much of the acid is dissipated A stronger acid would dissolve more The calces of lead are more soluble in this acid than genuine lead 100 grs minium require 327 grs of real acid but white lead is much less soluble 100 grs of horn lead formed by precipitation contain 72 of lead 18 of marine acid and 10 of water Silver in the vitriolic acid 100 grs of pure silver require to dissolve them 530 grs of real vitriolic acid whose proportion to water is not less than that of 1 to 310 and when such a concentrated acid is used it acts slightly even in the temperature of 60 but for a copious solutionthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 23 solution a moderate heat is requisite This solution affords 30 cubic inches of vitriolic air Standard silver affords more air and requires more acid for its solution The calces of silver that is silver precipitated from its solution in nitrous acid by fixed alkalies and wellwashed but which still retains some ni trous acid are soluble even in dilute vitriolic acid without the assistance of heat 100 grs of vitriol of silver formed by pre cipitation contain 74 grs of silver about 17 of real acid and 9 of water Silver in the nitrous acid 100 grs of the purest silver require for their solution 36 of mere nitrous acid diluted with water in the proportion of one part real acid to 6 of water applying heat only when the solu tion is almost saturate If spirit of nitre be much more or much less dilute it will not act without the assistance of heat The last portions of silver thus taken up afford no air Stan dard silver requires about 38 grs of real acid to dissolve the same proportion of it And the solution of it affords 20 cubic inches of nitrous air whereas 100 grs of silver revived from luna cornua afford about 14 Silver in the marine acid I have not been able to dissolve silver in its metallic state in spirit of salt yet I believe it may be effected if sufficient time be allowed as Mr BAYEN in his Treatise on Tin p 201 says he dissolved 312 grs of silver by digesting it for some days in two ounces of strong spirit of salt Leaf silver is also said to be corroded by strong spirit of salt 1 NEWM 70 The dephlogisti cated marine acid also dissolves it according to the observations of Mess SCHEELE and BERGMAN and so does the phlogisti cated24 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on cated in a vaporous state 100 grs of horn silver contain 75 of silver nearly 18 of acid and 7 of water Gold in aqua regia I made several experiments with aqua regia in which the nitrous and marine acids were mixed in different proportions and found that to succeed best in which the quantity of real marine acid was to that of the nitrous as 3 to 1 and both as concentrated as possible though if both be very concentrated it is hard to mix them so as to prevent a great quantity from escaping as they effervesce very violently some time after mix ture 100 grs of gold require 246 grs real acid for their solu tion the two acids being in the above mentioned proportion The specific gravity of the nitrous acid I used was 1465 and that of the marine 1178 The solution is better promoted by allowing it sufficient time than by applying heat The heat I used did not exceed 90 or 100 Very little air is produced and the solution is very slow Aqua regia made with common salt or sal ammoniac and spirit of nitre is much less aqueous than that resulting from an immediate combination of both acids and hence is the fittest for the production of crystals of gold Gold is also soluble in the dephlogisticated marine acid but in very small quantity unless this acid be in a vaporous state for in a liquid state it is too aqueous In vitriolic and nitrous acids it is also insoluble but the calces of gold are easily solu ble in the marine acid very slightly in the nitrous and scarce at all in the vitriolic Gold in its metallic state may be diffused through but not dissolved by the concentrated nitrous acid 6 Mercurythe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 25 Mercury in vitriolic acid 100 grs of quicksilver require for their solution 230 grs of real vitriolic acid whose proportion to that of water is at least as 1 to 810 and also a strong heat The air produced is vitriolic Precipitate per se is still less soluble 100 grs of vitriol of mercury produced by precipitation contain 77 of mercury 19 of acid and 4 of water Mercury in nitrous acid 100 grs of mercury are dissolved by 28 grs of real nitrous acid whose proportion to that of water is as 1 to 1 and 52100 and without the assistance of heat Mercury is also soluble but in smaller quantity in a much more dilute acid with the assistance of heat The product of air is about 12 cubic inches or less if heat be not applied Mr LAVOISIER found the pro duct of air much greater which evidently was caused by his using red or yellow spirit of nitre which already contains much phlogiston When I dissolved a hundred grs of mercury in three times more acid than was necessary for its solution and without heat I obtained but 7 cubic inches of nitrous air and the solution was green but on applying heat when the solu tion was over I obtained 2 more cubic inches and then the solution was of the colour of oil of olives Precipitate per se is much more difficulty dissolved by nitrous acid than genuine mercury which I attribute to the attraction of the aerial acid contained in the precipitate Mercury in marine acid The marine acid in its common phlogisticated state does not act on mercury at least in its usual state of concentration VOL LXXIII E but26 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on but Mr HOMBERG in the Paris Memoirs for the year 1700 assures us he dissolved mercury in marine acid whose specific gravity was 1300 by keeping it some months in digestion The authors of the Cours de Chymie de Dijon affirm also its solubility in this acid though in very small quantity The dephlogisti cated marine acid in a vapourous state certainly acts upon it though while in a liquid state it is too weak by reason of its dilution Precipitate per se is also soluble in marine acid with the assistance of heat 100 grs of sublimate corrosive contain 77 of mercury 16 of real acid and 6 of water 100 grs of mercurius dulcis contain 86 of mercury and 14 of acid and water Zinc in vitriolic acid 100 grs of zinc require for their solution 100 grs of real acid whose proportion to that of water may be as 1 to 8 10 or 12 applying heat towards the end when the acid is almost saturated A small quantity of black powder always remains undissolved The product of inflammable air is 100 cubic inches It is soluble in the concentrated vitriolic acid with the aid of heat 100 grs of vitriol of zinc contain 20 of zinc 22 of acid and 58 of water The calces of zinc if not exceedingly dephlogisticated are also soluble in this acid Zinc in nitrous acid 100 grs of zinc require for their solution 125 grs of real nitrous acid whose proportion to that of water is as 1 to 12 applying from time to time a slight heat If a concentrated acid 2 bethe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 27 be used less will be dissolved as much of the acid will escape during the effervescence I could procure no nitrous air from the solution by any management as the nitrous acid is in part decomposed during the operation The calces of zinc if not too much dephlogisticated are also soluble in this acid Zinc in Marine Acid The same quantity of zinc requires of this acid 210 grs the proportion of real acid in the menstruum being as 1 to 9 and using from time to time a slight heat If a less dilute acid be used more real acid will be requisite as much of it will escape during the effervescence The calces of zinc are also soluble in this acid Bismuth in vitriolic acid 200 grs of oil of vitriol whose specific gravity was 1863 dissolved but three grs of wismuth in a strong heat but slightly dephlogisticated a greater quantity 400 grs of spirit of vitriol whose specific gravity was 1200 dissolved but one grain The calces of wismuth are much more soluble The solution of the 3 grs afforded 4 cubic inches of vitriolic air Bismuth in nitrous acid The solution of 100 grs of bismuth require but 100 grs of real nitrous acid whose proportion to water should be as 1 to 8 or 9 In this last case a gentle heat may be applied This solution affords 44 cubic inches of nitrous air The calces of bismuth are also soluble in this acid E 2 Bismuth28 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on Bismuth in marine acid 400 grs of spirit of salt whose specific gravity is 1220 dissolved only 3 or 4 grs of bismuth Nickel in vitriolic acid 100 grs of concentrated vitriolic acid dissolve about 4 of nickel with the assistance of a strong heat The calces of nickel are much more soluble Nickel in nitrous acid 100 grs of nickel require for their solution 112 grs of ni trous acid whose proportion to water is as 1 to 11 or 12 assisted with a moderate heat A concentrated acid acts so rapidly that much is dissipated The product of nitrous air is 79 cubic inches The calces of nickel are also soluble in this acid Nickel in marine acid 200 grs of spirit of salt whose specific gravity is 1220 dissolved 4 or 5 grs of nickel without the assistance of heat A weaker acid dissolves less and requires the assistance of heat In all these cases of difficult solution more of the metal will be taken up by distillation and cohobation but the proportion will be difficult to assign The calces of nickel are also difficulty soluble in this acid Cobalt in vitriolic acid 100 grs of cobalt require 450 grs of real acid whose pro portion to its water is not less than 1 to 710 and a heat of 4 270the Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 29 270 at least By pouring warm water on the dephlogisticated mass a solution is obtained The calces of cobalt are still more soluble even a dilute acid will serve Cobalt in nitrous acid 100 grs of cobalt requires 220 grs of real nitrous acid whose proportion to water is as 1 to 4 giving towards the end a heat of 180 The calces of cobalt are soluble in this acid Cobalt in marine acid 100 grs of spirit of salt whose specific gravity is 1178 dissolves with the assistance of heat 212 grs of cobalt A more concentrated acid will dissolve more The calces of cobalt are more soluble in this acid Regulus of antimony in vitriolic acid 100 grs of regulus of antimony require for their solution 725 grs of real acid whose proportion to water is as 1 to 710 and a heat of 400 More regulus should be employed than is expected to be dissolved and the resulting salt requires a large quantity of water to dissolve it for the concentrated acid lets fall much when water is added to it A less concentrated acid will also dissolve this semimetal but in smaller quantity The calces of antimony even diaphoretic antimony are something more soluble Regulus of antimony in nitrous acid 100 grs of this semimetal require 900 grs of real nitrous acid whose proportion to water is as 1 to 12 aided with a heat30 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on heat of 110 The solution however becomes turbid in a few days The calces of antimony are soluble in a much less degree Regulus of antimony in marine acid 100 grs of spirit of salt whose specific gravity is 1220 dissolve about 1 gr of regulus with the assistance of a slight heat Spirit of salt whose specific gravity is 1178 also acts upon it but dissolves still less I believe the concentrated acid would in a long time and with the help of a gentle heat dissolve much more of it The calces of antimony are much more soluble in this acid Regulus of arsenic in vitriolic acid 200 grs of oil of vitriol whose specific gravity is 1871 dissolve 18 of regulus of arsenic in a heat of 250 Of these about 7 crystalize on cooling and are soluble in a large quan tity of water The calces of arsenic are more soluble in this acid Regulus of arsenic in nitrous acid 100 grs of this semimetal require 140 grs of real nitrous acid whose proportion to water is as 1 to 11 and the assistance of heat It is soluble in a less or more concentrated acid but in a lesser degree This solution affords 102 cubic inches of nitrous air The barometer at 30 and the thermometer at 60 The calces of arsenic are also soluble in this acid Regulus of arsenic in marine acid 100 grs of spirit of salt whose specific gravity is 1220 dissolve 112 grs of regulus of arsenic the marine acid in its commonthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 31 common dilute state that is whose specific gravity is under 117 does not at all affect it The calces of arsenic are less soluble in this acid than in the vitriolic or nitrous We have now gone through most of the bases to which acids are capable of uniting maganese and platina I have purposely omitted as I was not possessed of a sufficient quantity of either in that degree of purity requisite for exact experiments We have also seen the quantity of the mineral acids requisite to saturate each basis except the metallic bases all of which require an excess of acid not only to dissolve them as in most cases much of it flies off with the phlogiston in an aerial form but also to keep them in solution The quantity of any basis taken up by a given quantity of any of these acids is easily found for if 100 grs of any basis take up at the point of saturation or require for their solution the quantity a of any acid the quantity taken up or dissolved by 100 grs of that acid will be 10000a The proportion of ingredients which I have assigned to dif ferent neutral salts appears at first sight very different from that which Mr BERGMAN has ascribed to them This for some time made me very uneasy as I have the highest confi dence in the skill and judgement of that excellent chymist but on a strict examination I have found that the difference is more apparent than real Mr BERGMAN has never attempted to ascertain the quantity of real acid in any substance but has according to the custom of all preceding writers bestowed the title of acid on those liquids which contain it in the most con centrated or at least in a very concentrated state but which still32 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on still confessedly contain some undetermined proportion of wa ter and by the quantity of water he commonly understands that which is retained by crystallization thus in his first vol p 137 he says that 100 grs of vitriol of iron contain 23 of iron 39 of vitriolic acid and 38 of water But in his treatise De Productis Vulcanicis  12 he says that 100 grs of vitriol of iron contain 24 of iron 24 of dephlegmated vitriolic acid and 52 of water and this last calculation scarcely differs from mine as I assign to 100 grs of vitriol 25 of iron 20 of real vitriolic acid and 55 of water The difference manifestly arises from the quantity of water still contained in his de phlegmated acid The most material difference between us regards the quantity of the mineral acids taken up by alkalies for according to his and Mr SCHEFFERS experiments they take up more of the vitriolic than of the nitrous and more of the nitrous than of the marine whereas according to Mr HOMBERGS Dr PLUMMERS Mr WENZELS and my experiments this does not happen This difference arises in all probability from the different degrees of evaporation by which the crystals of these salts are obtained for which reason I did not examine the quantity of the crystals which must be variable but that of dry salt left after through evaporation With regard to the quantity of earth and metallic basis in dif ferent salts Mr BERGMANS experiments and mine agree almost intirely The advantages resulting from these inquiries are very consi derable not only in promoting chymical science which being a physical analysis of bodies essentially requires an exact deter mination as well of the quantity and proportion as of the quality of the constituent parts of bodies but also in the practical way Thus in the first place it is well known that severalthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 33 several important processes are very inaccurately described by antient chymical writers and even by some of a modern date they frequently for instance describe the acid they employed by reference to the quantity of fixed alkali earth or metal a given quantity of such acid was capable of neutralizing or dissolving Now the foregoing observations immediately in form us of the quantity of real acid capable of performing that effect the remainder therefore must have been water and the quantity of real acid and water being known the specific gravity is easily found by the help of the foregoing tables and thus an acid of the same strength may be formed Thus SCHLUTTER in the best treatise on Essaying yet extant  in forms us that the best aqua fortis for parting silver from gold is that of which a pound dissolves one mark that is half a pound of silver then 1000 grs of it should dissolve 500 of silver Now by the foregoing experiments we find that 100 grs of alloyed silver require 38 of real acid for their solu tion consequently 500 grs of silver will require 190 grs consequently 1000 grs of such spirit of nitre should contain 190 grs of real acid and 810 of water Then recurring to the table of the nitrous acid I find by the rule of proportion that the specific gravity of this acid must be about 1261 for as 190 is 810 so is 393 acid to 1675 of water This pro portion of water is somewhat greater than that I used but SCHLUTTER uses a sand heat 2dly The importance of this knowledge in the art of phar macy is very obvious especially with regard to medicines formed of metallic substances whose powers depend on the proportion of their ingredients and their action on each other 3dly This degree of precision must tend considerably to the  Vol I p 332 French edition VOL LXXIII F improve34 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on improvement of the arts of dying and enamelling the pro cesses by which many of their ingredients are procured being at present much too vague Thus the process at present used for preparing the precipitate of CASSIUS frequently fails the strength of the acids not being sufficiently ascertained 4thly The uses of this knowledge in the examination of mineral waters and in essaying of ores have been amply proved in the elaborate treatises which the celebrated BERG MAN has lately given us on these subjects And I may further add that the knowledge of the quantity of acid requisite for the solution of different metallic substances may also furnish us with a new criterion for distinguishing them from each other and the purer from their alloys and in some cases inform us of the quantity and quality of the alloy thus 100 parts pure silver require less of the nitrous acid to dissolve them than 100 grs of standard silver thus also by dissolving in spirit of salt any metallic substance sufficiently soluble therein we may know whether it contains the smallest particle of silver quick silver or arsenic as these are almost insoluble therein or of regulus of antimony cobalt nickel or wismuth of which it also takes but a small proportion But the end which of late I had principally in view was to ascertain and measure the degrees of affinity or attraction that subsist betwixt the mineral acids and the various bases with which they may be combined a subject of the greatest impor tance as it is upon this foundation that chymistry considered as a science must finally rest and though much has been already done and many general observations laid down on this head yet so many exceptions have occurred even to such of these observations as seemed to have been most firmly established that not only a variety of tables of affinity have been formed 7 butthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 35 but many very eminent chymists have been induced to doubt whether any general law whatsoever could be traced But as the judicious BERGMAN well observes it were much more rea sonable to examine the circumstances of these exceptions which undoubtedly arise from the introduction of new powers and lay down rules qualified with such restrictions as are observed in the action of these antagonist powers This is the plan I have followed but before I proceed to explain myself I must open the subject in a more general way Chymical affinity or attraction is that power by which the invisible particles of different bodies intermix and unite with each other so intimately as to be inseparable by mere mecha nical means In this respect it differs from magnetic and electrical attraction It also differs from attraction of cohesion in this that the latter takes place betwixt particles of almost all sorts of bodies whose surfaces are brought into immediate contact with each other for chymical attraction does not act with that degree of indifference but causes a body already united to another to quit that other and unite with a third and hence it is called elective attraction Hence attraction of cohe sion often takes place betwixt bodies that have no chymical attraction to each other thus regulus of cobalt and wismuth have no chymical attraction to each other for they will not unite in fusion yet they cohere with each other so strongly that they can be separated only by a stroke of a hammer Hence bodies which refuse to unite to each other chymically when they are most minutely divided as when both are in a vaporous or aerial state or when both are in a liquid state may be judged in the first case to have none or in the second case to have at best but a very small affinity to each other But those that unite when one of them only is in a liquid state F 2 may36 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on may be said to have a strong affinity to each other and it is thus that acids unite to alkalies earths and metals for the most part In order to determine the degrees of affinity Mr GEOFFROY has laid it down as a general rule that when two substances are united and either quits the other to unite to a third that which thus unites to this third substance must be said to have a greater affinity to it than to the substance it has quitted This undoubtedly is the case when only two attractive powers are concerned thus when selenite is decomposed by a caustic fixed alkali it is evident that the vitriolic acid has a stronger affi nity to the alkali than to the earth but in many cases a de composition seemingly single is in fact double and the result of the action of more than two powers and then it is not easy to know which is the greatest nor consequently to determine the degree of attraction for instance the vitriolic acid unites to a mild fixed alkali and expels the fixed air from it yet it does not necessarily follow that the vitriolic acid attracts or is attracted by the alkali more strongly than the aerial acid for though there appears here only a single decomposition yet in reality a sort of double decomposition takes place the vitriolic acid giving out its fire to the aerial while the aerial resigns the alkali to the vitriolic and hence a decomposition might well take place even on the supposition that the affinity of both acids to the alkali was equal therefore to attain any certainty in this matter it is necessary to ascertain the quantity and force of each of the attractive powers and denote it by numbers Mr MORVEAU was the first who perceived the necessity of this calculation and he has accordingly communicated to us in numbers a table of the attractive power of mercury with respect to metals but his method is incapable of being genera 5 lizedthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 37 lized Mr WENZEL had also an eye to such calculation but his method is much more defective It is only this  To  discover says he the quantity of affinity which the nitrous  acid bears to the different substances with which it is capable  of uniting let small equal cylinders of each of the metals  be covered over except at one end with melted amber and  then exposed to equal quantities of the same spirit of nitre  and in the same temperature then let the times of the solu  tion of each be noted The affinity of the acid to each of these  metals will be inversely as the times necessary for the solution of  equal quantities of them And as he well knew that spirit of nitre of the same degree of concentration would not act equally on each of them he required that it should be diluted in some cases and undiluted in others and allowance to be made for this in the subsequent calculation But alkalies and earths are here intirely omitted and even as to metals no conclusion can be drawn by this method Tin and regulus of antimony are most rapidly attacked by this acid lead and cop per much more slowly yet it is well known that its affinity to lead is much stronger than its affinity to tin and its affinity to copper greater than to regulus of antimony Silver and quicksilver are more slowly dissolved and yet the affinity of the nitrous acid to these metals as will be seen in the sequel is by far the greatest Neither can this method be in any wise applied to the estima tion of the affinities of the other mineral acids for though the vi triolic and marine acids dissolve very slowlydifficultly and spa ringly several metals that are copiously and readily dissolved by the nitrous yet they both have a stronger affinity to those very metals than the nitrous has to them as is evident with regard to silver mercury and lead which are precipitated from the nitrous38 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on nitrous by the vitriolic and marine though the two first are insoluble in the marine and all three difficultly soluble in the vitriolic Accordingly we do not find that Mr WENZEL has ever made the proposed experiments at least he makes no men tion of their result The discovery of the quantity of real acid in each of the mineral acid liquors and the proportion of real acid taken up by a given quantity of each basis at the point of saturation led me unexpectedly to what seems to me the true method of in vestigating the quantity of attraction which each acid bears to the several bases to which it is capable of uniting for it was impossible not to perceive First That the quantity of real acid necessary to saturate a given weight of each basis is inversely as the affinity of each basis to such acid Secondly That the quantity of each basis requisite to saturate a given quantity of each acid is directly as the affinity of such acid to each basis Thus 100 grs of each of the acids require for their satura tion a greater quantity of fixed alkali than of calcareous earths more of this earth than of volatile alkali more of this alkali than of magnesia and more of magnesia than of earth of allum as may be seen in the following table Quantity of basis taken up by 100 grs of each of the mineral acids Veg fixed Min Calcar Vol Mag Earth of alkali alkali earth

numbers agree with what common experience teaches us concerning the affinity of these acids with their respective bases they may be considered as adequate expressions of the quantity of that affinity and I shall in future use them as such Thus the affinity of the vitriolic acid to fixed vege table alkali that is the force with which they unite or tend to unite to each other is to the affinity with which that same acid unites to calcareous earth as 215 grs to 110 and to that which the nitrous acid bears to calcareous earth as 215 grs to 96 c But before I proceed further in the comparison of these forces it is necessary to say something of the nature of saturation A body is said to be saturated with another when it is so intimately combined with that other as to lose some peculiar characteristic property which it possesses when free from that other Thus acids possess the property of changing the juice of turnsol or infusion of litmus red According to Mr BERGMAN one grain of the most concentrated oil of vitriol will give a visible redness to 172300 grs of this infusion and one cubic inch of water saturated with fixed air the weakest of all acids as is generally thought of which water takes up only about its own bulk and consequently 253 grs take up only about half a grain reddens 50 cubic inches that is about 12650 grs of the infusion When acids lose this pro perty they are said to be saturated and if both bodies are satu rated the compound is said to be neutralized If an acid be united to less of any basis than is requisite for its saturation its affinity to the deficient part of its basis is as the ratio which that deficient part bears to the whole of what the acid can saturate Thus if 100 grs of vitriolic acid be united to 55 parts only of calcareous earth its affinity to the deficient 55 parts40 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on 55 parts should be estimated half of its whole affinity as 55 is the half of 110 but its affinity to the retained part is as its whole affinity I shall now shew how all decompositions in which these three acids and the above mentioned bases are alone concerned may easily be explained In all decompositions we must consider first the powers which resist any decomposition and tend to keep the bodies in their present state and secondly the powers which tend to effect a decomposition and a new union The first I shall call quiescent affinities and the second sort divellent A decomposition will always take place when the sum of the divellent affinities is greater than that of the quiescent and on the contrary no decomposition inferredwillinferred happen when the sum of the quiescent affinities is superior to or equal to that of the divellent all we have to do therefore is to compare the sums of each of these powers Thus if the solutions of tartar vitriolate and nitrous selenite be mixed a double decomposition will take place a true selenite and nitre being the result of such mixture Quiescent affinities Divellent affinities Vitriolic acid to fixed veget alkali 215 Vitriolic acid to calcareous earth 110 Nitrous acid to calcareous earth 96 Nitrous Acid to vegetable alkali 215   Sum of the quiescent affinities 311 Sum of the divellent  325 Hence a double decomposition must necessarily happen The same double decomposition will be produced if instead of tartar vitriolate GLAUBERS salt be used 1 MARGR 392 for the sum of the quiescent affinities is 261 and that of the divellent 275 So also if vitriolic ammon be used for the sum ofthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 41 of the quiescent is 186 and that of the divellent 195 or Ep som salt 1 MARGR 390 Mem Par 1778 p 339 or allum 1 MARGR 387 The determinations however with regard to allum are not quite so exact as the foregoing because allum whether vitriolic nitrous or marine constantly retains an excess of acid the exact point of saturation cannot be found as I have already remarked and is well known however the superiority is on the side of the divellent affinities as it should be If instead of a solution of nitrous selenite that of ma rine selenite be mixed with the solutions of the above men tioned vitrioliconeutral salts the same sort of double de composition will happen and a true selenite will be formed 1 MARGR 382 and on calculation it will be constantly found that the sum of the divellent constantly exceeds that of the quiescent affinities So also if a solution of tartar vitriolate be mixed with a solution of nitrous or marine Epsom a double decomposition will take place though no visible change will appear in the mixed liquor as vitriolic Epsom is exceeding soluble in water and therefore is not precipitated as selenite is on account of its insolubility Mem Par 1778 p 338 In the first case the sum of the quiescent powers is 290 and of the divellent 295 in the second case that of the quiescent is 286 and of the divellent 295 If a solution of GLAUBERS salt be mixed with that of ni trous or marine Epsom an invisible double decomposition will also happen Mem Par ibid Hence Mr QUATREMERE DIJONVAL who lately denied this double decomposition ROZ Mai 1782 p 392 was certainly deceived In the first case the sum of the quiescent affinities is 240 and of the divellent 245 in the second case that of the quiescent is 236 and of VOL LXXIII G the42 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on the divellent 238 Further if a solution of nitre be mixed with a solution of marine selenite an invisible double decom position will ensue Mem Par 1778 p 341 the sum of the quiescent powers being 304 and of the divellent 313 If a solution of nitrous Epsom be mixed with that of ma rine selenite a double decomposition will be the consequence 17 ROZ 393 the sum of the quiescent affinities being 164 and that of the divellent 167 From all which I collect first that the quantity of each affinity as here determined perfectly coinciding with all the facts hitherto known which are pretty numerous may be looked upon as exact or nearly so 2dly That these decompo sitions are perfectly consistent with the superior affinity which hitherto has been generally ascribed to the vitriolic and nitrous acids with fixed alkalies over that which these acids bear to earths and do not in the least infringe the received laws of affinities as Mess MARHER MONNET and lately Mr COR NETTE in the Memoirs of Paris for 1778 p 339 do insinuate There is a fact however in that valuable repository of chymical knowledge Mr CRELLS Chymical Journal  which at first sight seems contrary to one of the above determinations it is there said that if solutions of one part allum and two parts common salt be mixed together evaporated to a certain degree and set to crystallize a GLAUBERS salt will be found yet in this case the sum of the quiescent affinities is 233 and that of the divellent but 223 I repeated this experiment without success and indeed the author owns it never succeeds but during the most intense cold If it does succeed at all the decomposition must arise from a large excess of acid in the allum which acted upon and de  6 THEIL p 78 composedthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 43 composed the common salt and this explanation is confirmed by the small proportion of GLAUBERS salt which is said to be obtained by this process for from 30 lbs of common salt and 16 lbs of allum only 15 lbs of GLAUBERS salt were pro duced whereas if the whole of the allum were decomposed there should be formed according to my computation of the proportion of acid in different salts 2912 lbs and according to Mr BERGMANS 22 lbs of GLAUBERS salt Besides these powers there exists another which neutral salts possess of uniting to certain substances without suffering any or but a very small decomposition and thus forming triple salts and sometimes quadruple This often causes anomalies and has not as yet been sufficiently investigated  Volatile alkalies in particular possess this power and hence perhaps arises the difference between Mr BERGMANS table and mine with regard to them and magnesia for though when perfectly caustic they do not perfectly precipitate magnesia from Epsom salt it is because they combine with this salt and form a triple salt According to my table the three mineral acids have the same affinity to vegetable fixed alkalies which will undoubtedly appear extraordinary to many as it is well known that the vitriolic acid decomposes both nitre and salt of sylvius but it should be remarked that tartar vitriolate is also decomposed by the nitrous and marine acids as Mr BAUME MARGRAAF and BERGMAN have found and nitre is decomposed by the marine acid as Mr CORNETTE has shewn at large in the Me moirs of Paris for 1778 and not only these salts but also GLAUBERS salt and vitriolic ammoniac are decomposed by the  In my next paper I shall examine some exceptions arising from this source G 2 nitrous44 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on nitrous acid and also these salts together with cubic nitre and nitrous ammoniac are decomposed by the marine acid as Mr BERGMAN and Mr CORNETTE have remarked all which shew that these decompositions are the effect of a double affinity or at least of compound forces I always suspected they arose from the different capacities of these acids for elementary fire but as the subject appeared to me of importance for greater certainty I made a series of experiments which differ from those hitherto made in several respects particularly in this that no heat was applied and the decompositions were disco vered not by crystallization but by tests First I procured equal weights of each of the mineral acids containing each the same quantity of real acid and throwing each suddenly on an ounce of the same oil of tartar I had the following results the temperature of all before mixture being 68 of FAHRENHEIT 100 grs of vitriolic acid containing 266 grs of real acid projected on 480 of oil of tartar raised the thermometer to 138 100 grs of spirit of nitre which also contained 266 grs real acid projected in the same manner on 480 grs of the same oil of tartar produced a heat of 120 100 grs of spirit of salt whose specific gravity was 1220 and which contained 266 grs of real acid projected on the above quantity of the same oil of tartar raised the thermo meter from 69 to 129 Hence it follows that the vitriolic acid contains more speci fic fire or at least gives out more on uniting to fixed alkalies than either the nitrous or marine and therefore when the vitriolic acid comes in contact with either nitre or salt of syl vius its fire passes into these acids which are thereby rarefied to a great degree and are thus expelled from their alkaline basisthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 45 basis which is then seized on by the vitriolic This explana tion is confirmed by the following experiments Into 400 grs of spirit of vitriol whose specific gravity was 1362 I put 60 grs of nitre The thermometer fell from 68 to 60 and during this time the nitrous acid was not expelled for I put in some filings of copper and they were not in the least acted upon but in five minutes after they visibly effer vesced which shews that the nitrous acid began to be expelled Again to 400 grs of oil of vitriol whose specific gravity was 1870 I put 60 grs of nitre the thermometer immediately rose from 68 to 105 and the nitrous acid was expelled in the form of a visible fume These experiments prove first that neutral salts are not decomposed by mere solution in an acid different from that which they possess 2dly That the nitrous acid being converted into vapour had imbibed a large quantity of fire But as the vitriolic in both these experiments was in much larger quantity than was necessary to saturate the alka line basis of the nitre I put 60 grs of nitre into 64 of the above spirit of vitriol which contained the same quantity of real vitriolic acid as the 60 grs of nitre did of the nitrous and added 40 grs of water and also a few grains of filings of cop per In less than two hours the copper was acted upon and consequently the nitrous acid was expelled Again to about 400 grs of oil of vitriol whose specific gra vity was 1870 I put 100 grs of common salt it immediately effervesced and gave out the marine acid in the form of a white vapour A thermometer held in the liquor rose but 4 but when placed in the froth it rose to 10 and fell again on being put into the liquor whence it follows that the vitriolic acid gave out its fire to the marine and that this latter received more46 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on more than it could absorb even in the state of vapour and hence communicated heat to the contiguous liquor From these experiments it is evident that the nitrous and marine acids receive fire from the vitriolic and are thrown into a vapourous state or at least so much rarefied as to be expelled from their alkaline basis notwithstanding that their affinity to that basis may be equally strong with that of the vitriolic I next proceeded to examine how tartar vitriolate and GLAU BERS salt are decomposed by the nitrous acid Into 400 grs of spirit of nitre whose specific gravity was 1355 and which contained about 105 grs of real acid I put 60 of pulverised tartar vitriolate The thermometer which stood at 68 was not in the least affected by standing in this mixture and there was scarce any sign of solution To try whether the vitriolic acid was disengaged I threw into the liquor a few grains of powdered regulus of antimony in 24 hours the vitriolic acid was in part disengaged for the regulus was acted upon and the liquor became greenish This semimetal being soluble in a mixture of the vitriolic and nitrous acids but in neither singly however a great part of the tartar vitriolate still remained un dissolved Afterwards I put the same quantity of tartar vitri olate into 400 grs of spirit of nitre whose specific gravity was 1478 the thermometer rose from 67 to 79 the tartar vitri olate was quickly dissolved and the regulus of antimony shewed the vitriolic acid was disengaged Hence it follows that in the last experiment the nitrous acid having the same affinity to the alkaline basis as the vitriolic but giving out during the solution more fire than was necessary to perform the solution the vitriolic receiving this fire was dis engaged for as it cannot unite to alkalies without giving out fire so when it receives back that fire it must quit them The reasonthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 47 reason why the nitrous acid which specifically contains less fire than the vitriolic gives out so much is that its quantity in both these experiments is far greater than that of the vitri olic it being in the first as 105 to 17 and in the second as 158 to 17 For this reason to 60 grs of spirit of nitre whose specific gravity was 1355 I added 1000 grs of water and into this dilute acid I put 60 grs of tartar vitriolate which contained exactly the same quantity of acid as the 60 grs of spirit of nitre After eight days the tartar vitriolate was almost intirely dissolved yet I could perceive no sign of its decomposition and after evaporation no nitre was found Hence I conclude that the nitrous acid can never decompose tartar vitriolate without the assistance of heat but when its quantity is so great that it contains considerably more fire and by the act of solution is determined to give out this fire The decomposition of GLAUBERS salt and vitriolic ammon neither of which as Mr BERGMAN observed is ever total may be explained in the same manner whereas the vitriolic ever so dilute decom poses both nitre and nitrous ammoniac totally Tartar vitriolate is also decomposed by the marine acid though very slowly for the same reason and in the same circumstances as it is decom posed by the nitrous acid as appears by the following experi ments Into 400 grs of spirit of salt whose specific gravity was 1220 I put 60 grs of tartar vitriolate The thermo meter was not in the least affected and the salt dissolved very slowly To try whether the vitriolic acid was disengaged I added some pulverised bismuth in twelve hours part of the bismuth was dissolved and could not be precipitated by the affusion of water a sign that it was held in solution by the compound acid which alone hath the property of 5 preventing48 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on preventing its precipitation by the affusion of water as Mr WENZEL has discovered Here the quantity of marine acid was much greater than that of the vitriolic and consequently it contained more fire but this circumstance alone is not sufficient it must besides be determined to give out that fire by the act of solution This appears by the experiments of Mr CORNETTE for when he mixed half an ounce of tartar vitriolate previously dissolved in water with two ounces of spirit of salt the tartar vitriolate was not decomposed Memoirs Paris 1778 p 49 for it being already dissolved no cold or heat was generated by mixing it with the spirit of salt and consequently the latter did not give out any fire Mr CORNETTE also observed that GLAU BERS salt is easier decomposed by the marine acid than tartar vitriolate this I have also experienced and the reason is first because GLAUBERS salt is more easily soluble in spirit of salt than tartar vitriolate and secondly because its alkaline basis takes up a greater quantity of the real marine acid than of the vitriolic whereas the basis of tartar vitriolate takes up an equal quantity of both acids consequently the marine gives out more fire in uniting to the basis of GLAUBERS salt than on uniting to that of tartar vitriolate Vitriolic ammoniac is also decomposed by the marine acid for the reason but in all these cases the quantity of the marine acid must much exceed that of the vitriolic or no de composition will take place The decomposition of nitro neutral salts by the marine acid depends on the same principles Mr CORNETTE found that cubic nitre was more easily decom posed than prismatic nitre and accordingly during the solu tion of prismatic nitre only 3 of cold were produced but during that of cubic nitre the thermometer fell 6 a sign that the spirit of salt gave out more fire in the latter case than inthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 49 in the former and its quantity must always be greater than that of the nitrous acid contained in the mineral alkaline basis because this basis requires for its saturation more of the marine than of the nitrous acid as we have already seen Yet the nitrous acid in its turn decomposes salt of sylvius and common salt as Mr MARGRAF has shewn but it must always be in greater quantity than the marine in order to con tain a sufficient quantity of fire for that effect To 400 grs of colourless spirit of nitre whose specific gravity was 1478 I put 60 grs of common salt it quickly effervesced and grew red yet the thermometer rose but 2 a sign that the marine acid had absorbed the greater part of the fire which the nitrous had given out and was thus expelled besides in this case the superior affinity of the nitrous acid to the mineral basis hastened the decomposition and hence the decomposition hap pens without solution whereas the marine acid does not de compose cubic nitre until it has dissolved it which is worthy of notice This mutual expulsion of the nitrous and marine acids by each other is the true reason why aqua regia may be made as well by adding nitre or nitrous ammoniac to spirit of salt as by adding common salt or sal ammoniac to spirit of nitre as Mr CORNETTE has well remarked Selenite is decomposed neither by the nitrous nor by the marine acids as Mess CHAPTAL and CORNETTE have observed The reason is evident on the above principles it is dissolved by neither without the assistance of heat and then the solution is performed by a foreign heat and not by that which these acids give out when they act without the assistance of heat Lastly whenever a vitrioliconeutral salt decomposed by either the nitrous or marine acid is evaporated to a certain degree the vitriolic expels these acids in its turn for the free VOL LXXIII H part50 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on part of the former acids being expelled by the heat of evapora tion the neutral salts begin to crystallize and consequently give out heat but the vitriolic being then in greater proportion reacts on these salts restores their specific fire to their acid principle and recombines with their alkaline basis as already explained Hence though allum is in reality decomposed by the nitrous and marine acids yet when the solution of it in either of these acids is evaporated to a certain degree the vitriolic acid of which it contains a larger proportion than any other terrene salt reacts on the nitrous and marine allums and expels their acids as Mr CHAPTAL has shewn In explaining these phenomena I have all along supposed the doctrine of Dr BLACK to be well known viz that solids ab sorb heat during their solution Both the heat and cold pro duced in different solutions seem to me to depend on the same principle If the menstruum gives out only so much of its fire as the solvend can absorb or less then cold is produced but if it gives out more of its specific fire than the solvend can absorb this surplus becomes sensible and affects the thermometer by producing heat in proportion to its quantity Of the affinity of the mineral acids to metallic substances Having thus in every instance established the agreement betwixt the quantity of any alkaline or terrene basis taken up at the point of saturation by a given weight of any of the three mineral acids and the quantity of affinity which each of these acids bears to such basis I naturally extended my views to metallic substances to try whether this coincidence could be traced with regard to them also but the difficulties that oc curred in this inquiry were so great that the same degree of certainty must not be expected as in the foregoing part Metalllcthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 51 Metallic substances when freest from all foreign mixture are obtained either in a reguline state or in that of a calx These calces if formed by fire are constantly combined with more or less of the aerial acid which is very difficulty ex tracted from them and very soon reabsorbed and if formed by solution they as constantly retain a portion of their solvent or precipitant so that the precise weight of the really metallic part is difficultly ascertained But though this should easily be effected still they would for the most part be unfit for my purpose because most of them when much dephlogisticated are insoluble in some or all the acids hence I chose metals in their metallic state for the subject of my experiments These consist of specifically different earths and phlogiston and of this they must lose a part before they can be dissolved in acids but besides that which escapes in an aerial form much more of it though separated from the metallic earth is yet retained in the solution by the compound of acid and calx It is this calx thus differently dephlogisticated by the different acids whose proportion I endeavoured to ascertain The great difficulty that occurred in this inquiry was that of finding the exact quantity of acid necessary to saturate the metallic substances for all metallic solutions turn solution of litmus red and consequently contain an excess of acid And the reason is because the salts formed by a due proportion of metallic calx and acid are nearly insoluble in liquids that do not contain a further quantity of acid and in some cases this quantity and even its proportion to the aqueous part of the liquor must be very considerable as in solutions of bismuth Hence I in vain endeavoured by caustic alkalies and limewater to deprive these solutions of this excess for when deprived even of only part of it many of the metals precipitated and all H 2 would52 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on would if deprived of the whole of it On this account I was obliged to use different methods of which I shall here give an instance With regard to the solution of silver in the nitrous acid as it could be had extremely saturate I began with it 657 grs of this solution contained according to my calcula tion and allowing for the quantity of acid carried off in the nitrous air 3138 grs of real acid and 100 grs of silver Of this solution I found that 9 grs gave a visible red tint to as much of a dilute solution of litmus as a quantity of spirit of nitre which contained 810ths of a grain of real acid and therefore I judged these 9 grs to contain an excess of acid amounting to 810ths of a grain and if 9 grs contain such an excess then the whole solution must have contained an excess amounting to 5610ths of a grain deducting which from 3138 we find the quantity of acid saturated by 100 grs of silver to be 2578 grs In this manner I proceeded with most other metallic solutions The vitriolic solutions of tin wismuth regulus of antimony nickel and regulus of arsenic contain ing a large excess of acid I saturated part of it with caustic volatile alkali before I tried them with the infusion of litmus and I used the same expedient with the nitrous solution of iron lead tin and regulus of antimony and all the marine solu tions The proportion of vitriolic and marine acid taken up by lead silver and mercury I determined by computing the quantity of real acid necessary to precipitate these metals from their solutions in the nitrous acid and of all the determina tions these appeared to me to be the most exact However as all the vitriols of these metals are though in a slight degree soluble in the nitrous acid I was obliged to rectify the result from other considerations and the same necessity occurred with regard to the marine salts of lead and mercury Thethe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 53 The result of these experiments was that 100 grs of each of these acids take up at the point of saturation of each me tallic substance dephlogisticated to such a degree as is necessary for its solution in each acid the quantities expressed in the fol lowing table which denote their degree of affinity to each metal Table of the affinity of the three mineral acids to metallic substances 100 grs Iron Cop Tin Lead Silver Mer Zinc Wis Nickel Co Reg of Reg of per cury muth balt antimo arsenic

I cannot say that these numbers are precisely such as I could extract from my observations on the colour of the solution of litmus for these indications are so precarious that I did not absolutely confide in them but adjusted the numbers as I thought other phenomena required However the deviations were not so considerable as to induce a doubt that metallic earths had not almost all a stronger affinity to the three acids than even fixed alkalies Nevertheless the common tables which postpone metallic substances to all others are in reality just they only require a different denomination being in fact tables of precipitation rather than of affinity as far as they relate to metallic substances expressing by their order what metallic substances precipitate others from the different acids But these precipitations are constantly the result of a double affinity and decomposition54 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on decomposition the precipitating metal yielding its phlogiston to the precipitated metal while the precipitated metal yields its acid to the precipitant Nor has this escaped the sagacity of Mr BERGMAN 2 N Act Ups 205 who has even confirmed it by experiments which I have repeated and found exact Thus though copper in its metallic form precipitates silver and mercury from the nitrous acid with great ease yet the calx of copper will precipitate neither The superior affinity of acids to metallic earths in preference to alkalies and unmetallic earths requiring further proof I shall here demonstrate it in a few instances with regard even to those metals which are com monly thought to have the least affinity to acids And first that the nitrous acid has a stronger affinity to silver than to fixed alkalies appears by a curious experiment of Mr MONNETS Dissolution des Metaux p 159 If a solution of silver in nitrous acid be poured into a mixed solution of fixed alkali and common salt the silver will be precipitated by the marine acid of the common salt and not by the free alkali contained in the liquor for a luna cornua is found Now if the nitrous acid had a greater affinity to the free alkali than to the silver it is evi dent that the decomposition would be wrought by the free alkali and then the silver would be precipitated pure and not in the state of horn silver but as it is precipitated in the state of horn silver it is plain its precipitation was not effected by a single but by a double affinity From whence it also follows that the marine acid has a greater affinity to silver than the nitrous has to fixed alkalies I repeated this experiment with a solution of lead and also of mercury in the nitrous acid and the result was similar horn lead and marine salt of mercury being formed Withthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 55 With regard to mercury the experiments of Mr BAYEN are well known he has shewn that vitriol of lead and sub corrosive can be deprived of no more than half of their acid even by caustic fixed alkalies 3 ROZ 293 Again as to lead if perfectly dry common salt be pro jected on lead heated to incandescence the common salt will be decomposed and horn lead formed 1 MARGRAF 35 and 38 Nor can this be attributed to the volatilization of the acid by heat for the alkali is as fixed as the lead and must there fore be caused by the greater affinity of the calx of lead to which when dephlogisticated the acid can unite Mr SCHEELE informs us that if a solution of common salt be digested with litharge the common salt will be decomposed and a caustic alkali produced SCHEELE on Fire p 175 He also decom poses common salt by simply letting its solution slowly pass through a funnel filled with powdered litharge  Mr TUR NER daily decomposes common salt by means of litharge Mr SCHEELE also decomposes marine selenite by means of litharge through simple mixture without the assistance of heat and the calcareous earth is separated in a caustic state which shews that this salt is decomposed by the single superior affinity of the metallic calx to the marine acid SCHEELE on Fire p 174 That acids have less affinity to volatile alkalies than to seve ral metallic substances appears in sundry instances Horn silver is soluble in volatile alkalies as is well known Now if this solution be triturated with four times its weight of mercury the marine acid will combine with the mercury and not with the volatile alkali for a mercurius dulcis and not a sal ammo niac will be formed as Mr MARGRAF has shewn 1 MARGR 286 If two parts sal ammoniac and one of filings of iron be  SCHFFER Chymische Foceles  59 triturated56 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on triturated together the smell of the volatile alkali will imme diately be perceived  or if instead of iron minium or diapho retic antimony or zinc be used that smell is perceived as soon as they are mixed 9 Mem Scav Etrang p 575 MONNET Diss Met 209 But it will naturally be asked how then it happens that all metallic solutions are precipitated by alkalies and earths The answer is easy all metallic salts are held in solution by an excess of acid If alkalies and earths did nothing more than absorb this excess of acid a precipitation ought to take place but they do still more for they take up the greater part even of the proportion of acid necessary to saturate the metallic earth and this they are enabled to do by means of a double affinity for during the solution of metals only a comparatively small part of the phlogiston escapes out of the solution the remainder is retained by the compound of acid and calx when therefore an alkali or earth is added to such a solution the phlogiston quits the acid and recombines with the calx while the greater part of the acid unites to the preci pitant Notwithstanding this great affinity of metallic earths to acids salts whose basis is a fixed alkali or earth are in few instances decomposed by metals or their calces by reason of the inability of the acids while combined with these basis and thereby deprived of a great part of their specific fire to volati lize the phlogiston combined with the metallic earths which must necessarily be expelled before an acid can combine with them And as to metallic calces they are generally combined with fixed air which also must be in part expelled But ammoniacal salts containing much more fire for they absorb fire during their formation for that reason act much more powerfully on metals Allowing then the affinity of the  MONNET Dissol Met 71 6 mineralthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 57 mineral acids to metallic substances to be as above all double decomposition in which only salts containing these acids united to alkaline terrene or metallic bases are concerned admit of an easy explanation nay I am bold to say they cannot other wise be explained Thus if a solution of tartar vitriolate and of silver in the nitrous acid be mixed in proper proportions which is always to be understood nitre and vitriol of silver will be formed and this latter for the most part precipitated Quiescent affinities Divellent affinities Nitrous acid to silver  375 Nitrous acid to vegetable alkali 215 Vitriolic acid to vegetable alkali 215 Vitriolic acid to silver 390 Sum of the quiescent  590 Sum of the divellent powers 605 So also if instead of a solution of tartar vitriolate that of GLAUBERS salt or of vitriolicammoniac or selenite Epsom or allum be used for in all these cases the balance is con stantly in favour of the divellent powers yet the solutions of selenite and allum produce but a slight precipitation I also found that the solution of silver is precipitated by the vitriolic solutions of iron copper tin and probably by many other vitriolic solutions if for no other reason at least for this that they constantly contain an excess of acid but if a satu rate solution of silver be mixed with a very saturate solution of lead or mercury in the vitriolic acid the silver will not be pre cipitated as I have observed and in both cases the balance is in favour of the quiescent affinities The nitrous solution of silver is also decomposed and the silver precipitated by all marino neutral salts whether the basis be alkaline terrene or metallic as I have experienced and VOL LXXIII I these58 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on these decompositions are constantly indicated by the balance of affinities exhibited as above In the same manner silver is precipitated from the vitriolic acid by marino neutral salts whether their basis be alkaline terrene or metallic as I have found on trial and as the balance of affinities requires The nitrous solution of lead is also decomposed and the lead for the most part precipitated unless the solution be very dilute in the form of vitriol of lead by all the vitriolico neutral salts and also by all the marino neutral salts except marine salt of silver which only precipitates it by virtue of its excess of acid The marine solution of lead is decomposed by all vitriolico neutral salts except selenite and vitriol of nickel which can only precipitate it by virtue of an excess of acid The nitrous solution of mercury is also decomposed and the mercury for the most precipitated in the form of vitriol of mercury by all vitriolic neutral salts except vitriol of lead which can only decompose it by an excess of acid Nitrous solution of mercury is also decomposed by marino neutral salts except the marine salt of silver and lead which can only affect it by an excess of acid Vitriol of mercury is also decomposed by marino neutral salts which decomposition is also apparent by exposing the an tagonist powers yet a precipitation does not always appear as I have remarked particularly when marine allum is used which I attribute to the facility with which a small quantity of the marine salt of mercury is soluble in an excess of acid Marine salt of silver decomposes vitriol of mercury only through its excess of acid 2 Hencethe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 59 Hence we see why horn silver can never be reduced by fixed alkalies without loss as Mr MARGRAAF has shewn 1 MARGR 277 nor could it be decomposed at all but that the action of heat helps that of the alkali If to a solution of sublimate corrosive oil of vitriol be added a precipitation will appear but as Mr BERGMAN well remarks this does not proceed from a decomposition but from a substraction of the water necessary to keep the sublimate dissolved If to a solution of vitriol of iron some nitrous acid be added it immediately becomes turbid because the nitrous acid dephlo gisticates the calx of iron too much but the addition of more acid restores the transparency as the dephlogisticated calx is still soluble by a greater quantity of acid I omit a number of other curious phenomena which are explicable on these prin ciples I have assigned in the foregoing table two different affinities to the vitriolic acid with regard to wismuth and also to the marine acid with regard to nickel and wismuth The first shews that which these acids bear to those metals when de phlogisticated only by solution in those acids The second number that which the acids bear to them when more dephlo gisticated as they are when dissolved in the nitrous acid On the other hand all the acids have less affinity to the calces of iron zinc tin and antimony when they are dephlogisticated to a certain degree but as I could give no criterion of this dephlogistication I did not attempt to indicate the diminution it causes in the affinities of acids I 2 Of60 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on Of the precipitation of metals by each other from the mineral acids I am now come to the last point of my inquiry and the most difficult to be set forth with that degree of precision which I have been enabled to attain in the former parts for in the first place it is necessary to find the quantity of phlogiston in each of them not only in general but according to their various degrees of dephlogistication by each of the acids In this last particular I cannot assert that I have attained any thing like a certainty yet I hope what I advance may not be useless to chymical readers as it is not altogether groundless as it con tradicts no chymical fact but on the contrary is agreeable to many and affords a ready solution of all the phenomena Of the absolute quantity of phlogiston in metals The proportion of phlogiston in metallic substances rela tively to each other has been investigated in so masterly a man ner by Mr BERGMAN that I lay it down as the ground of my inquiries After his discovery all that remained was to find the absolute quantity of it in any one metal for then by an easy calculation it may be determined in all the rest The sub stance I chose for this purpose was regulus of arsenic as being most capable of dephlogistication by nitrous acid though not altogether so From 100 grs of regulus of arsenic dissolved in dilute nitrous acid as already seen 102 cubic inches of nitrous air and 410ths are obtained barometer at 30 thermometer at 60 I must add that I made the experiment on 5 grs only so that the calculation relates only to the quantity of air which 100 grsthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 61 grs should give I repeated the experiment three times with the same success I attempted getting more air from the resi duum left by a gentle evaporation but though fresh spirit of nitre grew red with it the quantity of air was quite inconsi derable Now this quantity of nitrous air contains 686 grs of phlo giston according to the calculation to be seen in my former paper and hence I conclude that 100 grs of regulus of arse nic contains 686 grs of phlogiston This regulus was made by Mr WOLFE and perfectly bright Hence the relative proportion of phlogiston in metals being as found by Mr BERGMAN and set forth in the first column of the following table the absolute quantity will be as shewn in the second column Relative quantity of phlogiston Absolute quantity 100 grs Gold  394   2482 Copper  312   1965 Cobalt  270   1701 Iron  233   1467 Zinc  182   1146 Nickel  156   982 Regulus of

ascertain it still further by other experiments and as62 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on as silver loses a certain quantity of phlogiston which escapes and separates from it during its solution in nitrous acid I con ceived that if the solution was exposed to nothing from which it could reobtain phlogiston and thus distilled to dryness and intirely separated from the acid as much silver should remain unreduced as corresponded with the quantity of phlogiston lost by it And if this quantity of phlogiston corresponded with that assigned to silver in the foregoing table that then this table was just For this purpose I dissolved 120 grs of clean filings of standard silver in dilute dephlogisticated nitrous acid and obtained from it 24 cubic inches of nitrous air This solution I gently evaporated to dryness by the evaporation I found a little of the silver volatilized but not more than a quarter of a grain I then distilled the dry residuum and kept it an hour in almost a white heat in a coated green glass retort During the distillation abundance of the nitrous acid passed off a green and white sublimate arose in the neck of the retort and some passed even into the receiver When all was cold I broke the retort the inside of which was penetrated into its very substance with a yellow and red tinge and partly covered over with an exceeding fine silver powder which could scarcely be scraped off The remainder of the silver was perfectly white and free from acid but not melted into a but ton and when collected weighed 94 grs therefore 26 grs were lost that is were sublimed or vitrified but of these 26 grs 9 grs were copper for 100 grs standard silver contain 712 of copper therefore only 17 grs of pure silver remained un reduced being either volatilized or vitrified The whole quan tity of pure silver in 120 grs of standard silver amounts to 111 grs then if 111 grs of pure silver lose 17 by reason of its lossthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 63 loss of phlogiston 100 grs of pure silver should lose 153 and by the above table 153 grs of silver should contain 0945 of a grain of phlogiston Let us now see whether this quantity of phlogiston corresponds with that which 100 grs of pure silver really lose by solution in nitrous acid 100 grs of pure silver afford as already said 14 cubic inches of nitrous air which by my computation contain 0938 of a grain of phlogiston which differs from 0945 only by 71000 The un reduced part of the silver was 153 grs and by calculating what it should be by reason of the loss of the phlogiston con tained in the nitrous air it would amount to 14 and 910ths of a grain a difference certainly immaterial In this experiment only as much of the silver sublimed as could not regain phlogiston the remainder regained it from the nitrous air absorbed by the solution and also from that which remained united to the acid and calx If this were not so I do not see why the whole of the silver would not sublime Again Dr PRIESTLEY having several times dissolved mer cury in the nitrous acid and revivified it by distilling over that acid constantly found a considerable proportion of it unre duced To try whether that proportion corresponded with my calculation I have examined the experiment which he made with most care and which is to be found in his 4th vol p 262 We there find that having dissolved 17 dwts 13 grs  321 grs of mercury in nitrous acid 112 dwt that is 36 grs remained unreduced Now according to my calculation 56 grs should remain unreduced for 100 grs of mercury afford 12 cubic inches of nitrous air therefore 321 grs should afford 3852 which contain 258 grs of phlogiston and if accord ing to the table 456 grs of phlogiston be necessary to metallize 100 grs of mercury 258 will be necessary to metallize 56 grs of64 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on of mercury and I am satisfied from my own trials that more than 50 grs would be found unreduced if dephlogisticated ni trous acid had been used in dissolving the mercury and the solution performed with heat and a strong acid but that which Dr PRIESTLEY used being the red or yellow sort already contained much phlogiston which contributed to the revivifi cation of a larger quantity of mercury than would otherwise be found It is true that Dr PRIESTLEY afterwards revivified a great part of what originally remained unreduced but this happened after it was for some time exposed to the free air from which the calces of the perfect metals always attract phlogiston as is evident in luna cornua which blackens on exposure to the air and hence also proceed the reductions operated by Mr BAYEN But Dr PRIESTLEY to whose luminous experiments chy mistry is already so much indebted has been so obliging as to furnish me with some which tend more directly to elucidate the present question In one experiment he found that nearly 5 dwts of minium from whence all its air was extracted that is about 118 grs absorbed 40 oz measures of inflammable that is 758 cubic inches  265 grs of phlogiston and were then reduced then 100 grs of minimum should require for their reduction nearly 225 grs of phlogiston In another experiment made with more care he found that 480 grs of minium absorbed 108 oz measures of inflammable air according to this then 100 grs of minimum require for their reduction 149 grs of phlogiston and in two other experiments he found this quan tity still less Upon which I remark first that the whole of the minium was not dephlogisticated for besides that it is never throughout equally calcined much of it must have been reducedthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 65 reduced during the expulsion of its air secondly that the quantity of the phlogiston in the inflammable air may have been greater as this varies with its temperature and the weight of the atmosphere so that upon the whole these experiments confirm the results expressed in the table Of the affinity of metallic calces to phlogiston That inflammable air or phlogiston is condensed to a very considerable degree by uniting to any metallic substance so that its specific gravity is not only equal but much superior to that of the metallic earth with which it combines may easily be concluded from the example of fixed air which by uniting to calcareous earth acquires a specific gravity equal to that of gold and hence that metallic earth which condenses phlo giston most and in greatest quantity uniting to it most closely may be said to have the greatest affinity to it so that if we could find the specific gravity of a calx perfectly pure both from phlogiston and fixed air we could by comparing its den sity with that of the same calx when metallized know the density which phlogiston acquires by its union with such calx but to procure such calces hath hitherto proved impossible as during their dephlogistication they combine with fixed air or some particles of their menstruum and hence their absolute weight is increased though their specific gravity be somewhat diminished From this last circumstance it appears that the spe cific gravity of calces differs much less from that of their respec tive metals than does the specific gravity which the phlogiston acquires by its union with those calces from that which it possesses in its uncombined state in the same manner as the density of quicklime differs much less from that of lime stone than does the density which fixed air acquires by its VOL LXXIII K union66 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on union with quicklime from that which belongs to it in its aerial state and hence instead of deducing the quantity of affinity of metallic calces to phlogiston from the following proposition viz that the affinity of metallic calces to phlogiston is in a com pound ratio of its quantity and density in each metal I am obliged to deduce it from this other viz that the affinity of metallic calces to phlogiston is directly as the specific gravity of the respec tive metals and inversely as the quantity of calx contained in a given weight of those metals This latter proposition is an ap proximation to the former founded on this truth that the larger the quantity of phlogiston in any metal is the smaller is the quantity of calx in a given weight of that metal and that the density which the phlogiston acquires is as the specific gravity of the metal This latter proposition however is not exactly true for this density is much greater yet it is the nearest approximation I can make and its defect is sensible only with regard to those metals which contain a considerable quantity of phlogiston viz gold copper cobalt and iron with regard to the rest it is of no importance Then the specific gravity of metals being as represented in the first column of the following table the affinity of their calces to phlogiston will be as is shewn in the second column The third column expresses these affinities in numbers homo genous with those which express the affinities of acids with their basis Goldthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 67 Specific gravity Affinity of the calces to phlogiston

any of the imperfect metals and hence its use in cuppellation for after it has lost its own phlogiston it extracts that of the base metals and thus pro motes their calcination and vitrification Though the numbers in the second column express tolerably well the greater or lesser affinity of metallic calces to phlo giston yet they have this inconvenience that they are not homogenous with those that express the affinities of acids to other bases which limits their use to a narrow compass they being on that account incomparable with those that express the affinities of acids I therefore endeavoured to find a coin cidence between them in some one instance in order to reduce them to the same standard as will be seen in the next para graph K 2 Os68 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on Of the affinity of the vitriolic acid to phlogiston in sulphur According to the principle above laid down this affinity is in a compound ratio of the quantity of phlogiston taken up by 100 grs of the vitriolic acid and of the density it acquires by its union with the acid Now 100 grs of sulphur contain 59 of acid and 41 of phlogiston and the specific gravity of sulphur is 2344 therefore the loss of weight of sulphur in water  1002344  4266 grs the loss of weight of the acid part of the sulphur is 594226  1396 grs therefore the remainder of the loss of sulphur is the loss of the phlogistic part  2870 grs then the absolute weight of the phlogiston being 41 grs its density will be 1429  41287 and since 100 grs of vitriolic acid take up 70 of phlogiston its affinity will be 1429 x 70  100 But if the affinity of the vitriolic acid to phlogiston in sulphur had been sought in the same manner with the affinity of metallic calces to phlogiston the quantity would be the same though the expression of that quantity would be different as relating to a different standard for by that method the affinity would be directly as the density of the phlogiston and inversely as the quantity of vitriolic acid contained in 100 grs of sulphur that is 142959 024 therefore this expression answers to and is equivalent to the former viz 100 By this means I formed the quantities expressed in the third column which are homo genous to those which express the affinities of acids to their basis Thus the affinity of the calx of gold to phlogiston is 1041 for 024 10025 1041 c Thethe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 69 The third point necessary for the explanation of the pheno mena attending the solution of metals and their precipitation by each other is to determine the proportion of phlogiston which they lose by solution in each of the acids and the affi nity which their calces bear to the part so lost I have not been able to determine this by any direct experiment for though I might determine the part which escapes in the form of air yet I could not that which is equally separated from the metal but retained in the solution yet from various collateral considerations I am induced to think the proportion of phlo giston separated from the metals by the different acids is at a medium as expressed in the following table Iron Cop Tin Lead Silver Mer Zinc  Co Nickel Reg of Reg of per cury muth balt antimo arsenic By vitriolic acid 23 810 710 98100 Intire 87100 85100 85100 93100 Intire 97100 86100 By nitrous acid 23 81100 710 88100 Intire 910 99100

calculated for they may be considered as acids whose affinity to the deficient part of their basis is as the ratio which that part bears to the whole as already said Thus the affinity of iron thoroughly deprived of its phlogiston being 375 as it loses 23ds of its phlogiston by solution in the vitriolic acid the affinity of iron to these two thirds is 23ds of its whole affinity that is 23ds of 375  250 These affinities together with those of the three acids to the several calces are represented together in the following table Vitriolic70 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on Iron

dephlogistication according to the species concentration and dephlogistication of their menstruum The more they are dephlogisticated the greater their affinity to phlogiston and in general the less their affinity to the mineral acids Yet there is a point of dephlogistication at which the attraction of acids to the calces is strongest thus the vitriolic acid attracts bismuth most strongly after it has been dephlogisticated by the nitrous acid and the marine acid attracts both bismuth and nickel more powerfully when dephlogisticated by the nitrous or vitriolic acids From these data we may easily conceive in most cases what will happen on putting one metal into the solution of another Thus if a piece of copper be put into a saturate solution of silver the silver will be precipitated for

metal will be dissolved by the free acid before any precipitation can appear yet it must not be intirely satu rate at least in some cases as will presently be seen I said in most cases because in some particularly where mer cury bismuth cobalt regulus of antimony or arsenic are used another power intervenes which has not yet been fully investigated viz the attraction of calces to each other which I shall occasionally mention It is worthy of observation that the precipitating metals are more dephlogisticated by this means than by direct solution in their respective menstruums and are even dissolved by men struums that would not otherwise affect them because their phlogiston is torn from them by two powers instead of one thus though copper be directly soluble in the vitriolic acid only when this acid is concentrated and heated to a great degree yet if a piece of copper be put into a dilute cold solu tion of silver or mercury in the vitriolic of acid or even into a dilute solution of iron exposed to the open air it will be dis solved a circumstance which justly excited the wonder of Mr MARGRAAF and Mr WENZEL who did not apprehend the theory of it and hence we see how vitriol of copper may be formed by nature and why it always contains a mixture of iron Of solutions in the vitriolic acid This acid dissolves iron and zinc without the assistance of heat because its affinity to their calces is greater than the affi 5 nity72 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on nity which these calces bear to that portion of phlogiston which they must lose before they can unite to the acid as may be seen by inspecting the table but all other metallic sub stances unite to this acid only where it is concentrated and heated Of solutions in the nitrous acid The nitrous acid has less affinity to all metallic substances than either the vitriolic or marine It has also less affinity to them than they have to that portion of phlogiston which they must lose before they can unite to it yet it dissolves them all gold and platina excepted even without the aid of heat be cause it unites itself to phlogiston unless too dilute and the heat produced by its union with phlogiston is sufficient to promote the solution But if it be too concentrated it will not act either on lead or silver without the assistance of heat as BOYLE and BOER HAAVE have remarked  for the difference betwixt its affinity to these metals and that of these metals to the portion of phlogiston which they must lose before they can unite to it is very great and when it is very concentrated the liquor does not contain fire enough to throw the phlogiston and it into an aerial form and reduce the solid to a liquid the same would probably be observed with regard to mercury if it had not been already in a liquid state STAHL has also remarked that it produces very little heat in dissolving silver and none in dis solving lead or mercury  This is easily explained now that we know that silver contains but little phlogiston and lead much less the heat being evidently produced according to the  1 SHAWS BOERH 508 2 SHAWS BOYLE 335  STAHL sur les sels 168 1 lawthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 73 law discovered by Dr CRAWFORD by the union of phlogiston to the acid for metallic calces produce no heat As to mer cury the observation is not exact for its solution is accompanied with heat as Mr LAVOISIER has observed 1 LAVOIS 248 Of solutions in the marine acid This acid is known to dephlogisticate metals less than any other Where the portion of phlogiston necessary to be sepa rated is more strongly attracted than the acid itself it can operate no solution or at least very slowly without the aid of heat nor even where the attraction of acid is stronger to the calx than that of the portion of phlogiston it separates if the proportion of acid to such calx be very small because so small a quantity of acid does not contain fire enough to volati lize the phlogiston and hence heat is necessary for the solution of lead in this acid The dephlogisticated acid acts more powerfully Of precipitations of and by iron The mutual precipitations of iron and copper from the vitriolic acid by each other have been well explained in a ge neral manner by Mr MONNET and Mr BERGMAN I shall here shew the reason of these precipitations more distinctly If a piece of copper be put into a saturate solution of iron fresh made no precipitation will happen nor will any of the copper be dissolved in twelve hours nor even in a longer time if the access of air to the solution be prevented but if the solution be exposed to the open air the addition of a volatile alkali will shew the copper to have been acted upon in 24 hours or sooner if heat be applied and a calx of iron is pre cipitated The operation of the affinities in the first case is as follows VOL LXXIII L Quiescent74 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on Quiescent Divellent Vitriolic acid to calx of iron 270 Vitriolic acid to copper  260 Copper to its phlogiston  360 Calx of iron to phlogiston 250 Sum    630 Sum    510 Hence in this case no decomposition can happen but in the second case much of the phlogiston of the solution of iron having escaped the affinity of the calx of iron to acid is diminished and that to phlogiston is increased and therefore the quiescent affinities may be supposed and the divellent Vitriolic acid to the calx of iron 240 Vitriolic acid to copper  260 Copper to its phlogiston  360 Calx of iron to phlogiston 370 600 630 But from the increased affinity of the calx of iron to phlo giston it might be inferred that as the iron recovers its phlo giston the acid should react upon it and quit the copper and this would certainly happen if it recovered its phlogiston in sufficient quantity but the access of air and heat prevents its retaining it at least in sufficient quantity This increased affinity of the calx of iron to phlogiston is not a mere supposition for if into a solution of iron so far de phlogisticated as to refuse to crystallize some fresh iron be put the impoverished calx will reattract so much of the phlogiston given out during the solution of the fresh iron that it will now afford crystals as Mr MONNET has observed in his excel lent Treatise on Vitriolization The diminished attraction of the calx of iron to acids is also evident from this experiment 4 andthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 75 and also from the necessity of adding more acid to a turbid solution of iron in order to reestablish its transparency The calces of copper also precipitate a dephlogisticated solution of iron as they should the affinity of the acid to such calx of iron being 240 and that to copper being 260 With regard to the solution of iron in nitrous acid the same thing happens but as this solution contains a large excess of acid a portion of copper is dissolved even before any of the iron is precipitated With regard to a solution of iron in the marine acid though exposed to the open air copper precipitates nothing from it in 24 hours But if a clean piece of iron be put into a solution of copper in the vitriolic acid the copper is immediately precipitated for here the quiescent and divellent affinities exhibited in the first scheme are reversed the quiescent becoming the divellent and vice versd It is needless to add that copper is in the same manner precipitated by iron from the nitrous and marine acids Hence the practice of extracting copper from some mineral waters by means of iron These waters therefore furnish afterwards by evaporation vitriol of iron but it is remarka ble that this vitriol is much paler than the common and less fit for dying 2 SCHLUTTER 507 The Reason of which is that it is more dephlogisticated not only because old iron is chiefly used but because copper containing more phlogiston than an equal weight of iron deprives it of more of its phlo giston than it would lose if barely dissolved in the vitriolic acid Cast iron according to SCHLUTTER will scarcely precipi tate a solution of copper and in effect Mr BERGMAN has found that it contains less phlogiston than bar iron L 2 I have76 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on I have always found silver to be easily precipitated from its solution in the nitrous acid by iron The sum of the quiescent affinities being 625 and that of the divellent 746 yet Mr BERGMAN observed that a very saturate solution of silver was very difficultly precipitated and only by some sorts of iron even though the solution was diluted and an excess of acid added to it  the reason of this curious phenomenon appears to me deducible from a circumstance first observed by Mr SCHEELE in dissolving mercury namely that the nitrous acid when saturated with it will take up more of it in its metallic form  The same thing happens in dissolving silver in the nitrous acid in a strong heat for as I before remarked the last portions of silver thrown in afford no air and consequently are not dephlogisticated Now this compound of calx of silver and silver in its metallic form may well be unprecipitable by iron the silver in its metallic form preventing the calx from coming in contact with the iron and extracting phlo giston from it and hence also iron has sometimes been ob served not to precipitate a solution of mercury in this acid  It has been long thought that iron may be precipitated from acids by zinc though NEWMAN long ago denied it but Mr BERGMAN has satisfactorily cleared up this point by shewing that zinc cannot precipitate iron from the vitriolic acid until the solution of iron loses part of its phlogiston With regard to the nitrous acid I found that zinc does not precipitate iron but on the contrary iron precipitates zinc but in a short time the acid redissolves the zinc and lets fall the iron which evidently proceeds from the too great dephlogistication of the calx of iron But zinc precipitates iron from the marine  Dissert de

struck a black I should also add that iron does not precipitate zinc from the vitriolic acid Most metallic substances precipitated by iron from the ni trous acid are in some measure redissolved shortly after as the nitrous acid soon dephlogisticates the iron too much then lets it fall and reacts on the other metals and redissolves them The precipitation of the argillaceous earth from allum by iron is owing to the excess of acid in the allum which first dephlogisticates the iron and when this is dephlogisticated it attracts the acid more strongly Earth of allum on the other hand precipitates iron when the solution of iron is dephlo gisticated by heat It may also produce this effect by depriving iron of its excess of acid which keeps it in solution Of precipitations of and by copper When silver is dissolved in the nitrous acid and a piece of copper is put into the solution it sometimes happens that the silver is not precipitated as Dr LEWIS has observed  This happens either when the nitrous acid is supersaturated with silver having taken up some in its metallic form as already observed or when the silver is not much dephlogisticated for then its affinity to phlogiston which is the principal cause of its precipitation is less than 491 therefore the remedy is to heat it and add more acid by which it is dephlogisticated fur ther However the nitrous acid always retains a little silver S C H L U T T E R 362 Hist Mem Par 1728 It is commonly said that if filings of copper be put into a hoilding solution of allum vitriol of copper will be found and  Commercium Philos p 157 the78 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on the earth of allum precipitated If this were true it would be very surprising as copper is soluble even with the assistance of heat only in the concentrated vitriolic acid Hence I made the experiment and found that after 20 hours boiling not the smallest particle of copper was dissolved for the colour of the solution was not altered by volatile alkalies and though the allum was precipitated it still retained its saline form so that it lost only its excess of acid in this experiment Of precipitations of and by tin Tin is not precipitated in its metallic form by any metallic substance and the reason is because its precipitation is not the effect of a double affinity but of the single greater affinity of its menstruum to every other metallic earth Metals that are precipitated from the nitrous acid by tin are afterwards re dissolved because the acid soon quits the tin it becoming too much dephlogisticated Of precipitations of and by lead Metals dissolved in the vitriolic and marine acids and preci pitable by lead according to the indication of the balance of affinities are yet slowly precipitated because the first portions of lead that are dissolved form salts of difficult solution which cover its surface and protect it from the further action of the acid and yet it contains so little phlogiston that a great deal of it must be dissolved before it gives out enough to precipitate the dissolved metals Mr BERGMAN observed that a very saturate solution of lead is difficultly if at all precipitable by iron Does not this also arise from some lead being taken up in its metallic form Iron does not precipitate lead from the marine acid though a prethe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 79 precipitate appears for this precipitate still retains the marine acid on the contrary lead precipitates iron from this acid though very slowly Of precipitations of and by mercury Though the difference betwixt the quiescent and divellent powers be very small yet mercury is quickly precipitated from the vitriolic acid by copper because the attraction of the calx of mercury to phlogiston is very strong and a very small pro portion of that contained in copper is sufficient to revive it Silver does not precipitate mercury from the vitriolic acid unless it contains copper and then it does precipitate it yet if silver and turpeth mineral be distilled the mercury will pass in its metallic form WENZEL 42 which shews that the affinity of calx of mercury to phlogiston is increased by heat The difference betwixt the quiescent and divellent powers is indeed very small Silver appeared to me to precipitate mercury from the nitrous acid though very slowly when the solution of mercury was made with heat and not over saturated but when the solu tion of mercury was made without heat it was not at all pre cipitated On the other hand mercury precipitates silver from this acid not by virtue of the superiority of the usual divellent powers but by reason of the attraction of mercury and silver to each other for they form partly an amalgama and partly vegetate and scarce any of either remains in the solution The same thing happens that is they vegetate if solutions of both metals in the same acid be mixed together Silver does not precipitate mercury from the solution of sublimate corrosive but on the contrary mercury precipi tates silver from the marine acid and if a solution of horn silver in volatile alkali be triturated with mercury the silver will80 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and

precipitations of and by bismuth With respect to the vitriolic acid I have made the sum of the quiescent and divellent powers equal though in fact some times the one preponderates and sometimes the other Wis muth precipitates nothing from vitriol of copper in 16 hours nor does copper from vitriol of wismuth Copper is said to precipitate wismuth from the nitrous acid but I have also seen copper precipitated from this in its metallic form by wismuth The variations proceed from the different dephlogistication of copper Of precipitations of and by nickel Unless nickel be pulverised it scarcely precipitates any metal Zinc precipitates a black powder from the solution of nickel in the vitriolic and nitrous acid which Mr BERGMAN by a method peculiar to him has shewn to consist of arsenic nickel and a little of the zinc itself The arsenic attracting the calx of nickel  but zinc precipitates nickel from the marine acid The solution of iron in vitriolic acid acts on nickel and that of nickel in this same acid acts on iron but neither pre cipitates the other in 24 hours but on longer rest iron seems to have the advantage but iron clearly precipitates nickel  I SUENSK Handling 1780 I fromthe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 81 from the nitrous acid and though nickel seems also to preci pitate iron yet this arises only from the gradual dephlogistica tion of the iron Nickel precipitates copper in its metallic form from the vitriolic acid It also precipitates copper from the nitrous and marine acids but copper precipitates arsenic from a nitrous solution of nickel The vitriolic and nitrous solutions of lead seem to act in specie on nickel that is to dissolve it without any decomposition the calces uniting to each other The vi triolic and nitrous solutions of nickel for some time act on lead in the same manner but at last nickel seems to have the ad vantage With regard to the marine acid lead seems to have the advantage though a black precipitate is seen whichever of them is put into the solution of the other Nickel readily precipitates wismuth from the vitriolic and nitrous acids but as to the marine I found each of these semi metals soluble in the solution of the other yet nickel precipi tates wismuth very slowly and only as to part and wismuth precipitates a red powder which I take to be ochre from the solution of nickel Nickel and tin are slightly acted on each by the salt of the other but the precipitations are as indicated by the balance of affinities Of precipitations of and by cobalt Cobalt is not precipitated either from the vitriolic or nitrous acid by zinc but it seemed to me to be precipitated by zinc from the marine acid Though iron precipitates cobalt from the three acids yet I found much of the cobalt retained both by the vitriolic and nitrous acids particularly the latter which after letting fall V O L LXXIII M the82 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations on the cobalt afterwards retakes it and lets fall the dephlogisti cated calx of iron Nickel also though it does not precipitate cobalt itself as appears by the remaining redness of the solution yet constantly precipitates some other heterogenous substance from it The solution of cobalt in the marine acid becomes colourless by the addition of nickel Wismuth is soluble in the vitriolic and nitrous solutions of cobalt and causes a small white precipitate but does not affect the true cobaltic part These solutions in vitriolic acid cannot be attributed to an excess of acid as they are made in a dilute acid and without heat Copper also precipitates a white sub stance from the nitrous solution of cobalt which I take to be arsenic It is difficult to procure either nickel or cobalt very pure it is evident those I used were not so Of precipitations of and by regulus of antimony Copper neither precipitates nor is precipitated from the vitriolic acid by regulus of antimony at least in three days but vitriol of antimony in specie dissolves it slowly The regulus is also acted upon by vitriol of lead for it be comes red after remaining 16 hours in the solution of that vi triol and lead scarcely precipitates it from the vitriolic acid I also found that powdered regulus precipitates vitriol of mercury very slightly Wismuth neither precipitates nor is precipitated by this regulus from the vitriolic acid in 24 hours Though tin precipitates this regulus from the nitrous acid yet if the regulus be put into a solution of tin in this acid in 16 hours neither will be found in the solution either bythe Attractive Powers of Mineral Acids 83 by reason of the dephlogistication or of the union of the calces to each other Iron does not precipitate this regulus intirely from the marine acid but a triple salt seems to be formed consisting of the acid and both calces The regulus is also soluble in marine salt of iron Neither does copper precipitate the regulus from marine acid in 16 hours and if the regulus be put into marine salt of copper it will be dissolved and volatile alkalies will not give a blue but a yellowish white precipitate so that here also a triple salt is formed Of Precipitations of and by regulus of arsenic The solutions of arsenic act in most cases like two acids thus iron copper lead nickel and zinc are acted on by vitriol of arsenic that is its solution in vitriolic acid but scarce give any precipitate Neither does iron precipitate arsenic from the nitrous acid but copper does and even silver gives a slight white precipitate but regulus of arsenic precipitates silver completely in 16 hours Hence the former precipitate seems to be a triple salt Mercury also slightly precipitates arsenic from the nitrous acid and seems to unite to it yet is itself precipitated by regulus of arsenic in 24 hours Wismuth forms a slight precipitate in the nitrous solution of arsenic but regulus of arsenic forms a copious precipitate in the nitrous solution of wismuth so that I believe the calces unite Nickel does not precipitate arsenic from the nitrous acid but both calces unite but regulus of arsenic produces a copious pre cipitate in the nitrous solution of nickel yet the liquor continues M 2 green84 Mr KIRWANS Experiments and Observations c green so that certainly the nickel is not precipitated the white precipitate in this case seems to be slightly dephlogisticated arsenic This regulus also causes a white precipitate in the nitrous solution of cobalt but the liquor still continues red With regard to the marine acid copper precipitates the regulus but volatile alkalies do not strike a blue with this solu tion which shews the copper unites with the arsenic Iron also precipitates the arsenic Tin is soluble in marine solution of arsenic but I could observe no precipitate nor does regulus of arsenic precipitate tin Neither wismuth nor the regulus of arsenic precipitate each other from the marine acid in 16 hours Regulus of antimony is also acted upon by the marine solution of arsenic though it causes no precipitate nor does the regulus of arsenic precipitate it

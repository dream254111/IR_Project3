call a summer meeting at the time and place of the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science The Society has recently published a vol ume of Current Superstitions by Mrs Fanny D Bergen and it has now in press a volume entitled Navaho Legends by Dr Washington Matthews A full programme of papers was pte sented of which only a part can be here mentioned Miss Alice C Fletchers  Notes on Certain Early Forms of Ceremonial Expression de veloped the idea that among savage peoples the burden of the song is to a greater ex tent than heretofore recognized correlated with the emotion which the song is desired to express Miss Fletcher has investigated this subject specially among the Omahas and her studies in this direction are still in progress Incidentally the accuracy of repetition and pure preservation of native songs was mentioned an example being an Omaha song recorded by means of the pho nograph which agreed in every detail with the same song as collected twelve years prior  Ceremonial HairCutting among the Omahas was treated by the same speaker The hair has been associated with strength in the lore of many peoples and has been treated as of close connection with the life and reality of the individual Thus some peoples when giving a name and thus ad ding an important part to the personality of an individual think it necessary to counter balance this act by cutting off a portion of the hair Mr W W Newells paper on The Le gend of the Holy Grail was intended to suggest that literary productions under certain circumstances may develop into folktales 215 s801SYCEN S VOL V No 110 Dr Robert M Lawrence spoke of the many superstitions connected with common salt even among our own people Mr Stewart Culin exhibited a number of Divinatory Diagrams from Tibet China Mexico etc and called attention to their similarity as well as to the fact that they being arranged on a plan of four quarters might be developed from the idea of the four cardinal points An Ojibwa Myth by Harlan I Smith referred to the whitedog sacrifice and ideas common to several of the neighboring tribes The Psychic Origin of Myth by Dr D G Brinton was an inquiry into how far the psychic unity of man satisfactorily accounts for similarities in myths found among widely separated peoples Dr Brintons position that it accounted for even minor details was vigorously contested by several present Mr Stansbury Hagar contributed from his store of Micmac mythology such parts as related to weather and the seasons Miss Whitney Secretary of the Balti more Branch of the Society contributed a paper on the lore of  The Sword and Belt of Orion or De Los Ell an Yard It seems that this group of stars in the constellation of Orion holds an important place in the folk lore of the negroes Dr Franz Boas related A Star Legend from the Interior of Alaska and its Ana logues from the other parts of America While holding to the idea generally ac cepted among scientists that the same fundamental concept may arise independ ently among widely separated peoples hav ing no contact and due purely to the same psychic phenomena common to man yet he held that similarity in a long series of minor details especially in cases where contact was possible could not be positively accounted for in that way and that historic influence must be considered as well as psychic unity Mr W S Scarborroughs paper on Ne gro Songs was an interesting contribution on the play songs of negro children  The True Story of Blue Beard by Pro fessor Thomas Wilson illustrated the mak ing of folklore the changing of a historic story to a legend by continual repeating with slight change in a way exactly oppo site to the accurate repetition of the Omaha song A public lecture was given in the evening by Mr Heli Chatelain on  African Life Illustrated Mr Chatelain who was late United States Commercial Agent in Angola spoke very feelingly against the existing Arab slave trade while his main subject was the ethnology of the Negroes of An gola from whom he collected the volume of folktales recently published by the So ciety The meeting concluded with the annual dinner In this the Society was

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108822,ON LARIXINIC ACID A CRYSTALLIZABLE VOLATILE PRINCIPLE FOUND IN THE BARK OF THE LARCH TREE PINUS LARIX LINN,I207017, 53 1 IV ON LARIXINIC ACID A CRYSTALLIZABLE VOLATILE PRINCIPLE FOUND IN THE BARK OF HE LARCH TREE PINUS LARIX LINN BY DR JOHN STENHOIUE FRS RECEIVED JULY 10READ NOVEMBER 21 1861 THE MOST CONVENIENT WAY OF PREPARING THIS SOMEWHAT SINGULAR SUBSTANCE CONSISTS IN CUTTING THE BARK OF THE LARCH INTO SMALL PIECES AND THEN DIGESTING IT IN WATER FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AT A TEMPERATURE OF ABOUT 80 CENT THE SOLUTION WHICH HAS A DEEP REDDISH BROWN COLOUR IS THEN POURED OFF ON TO A SECOND PORTION OF LARCH BARK AND DIGESTED AS BEFORE THE CONCENTRATED INFUSION IS THEN CAUTIOUSLY HEATED IN AN OPEN PORCELAIN DISH AT THE TEMPERATURE OF ABOUT 80 CENT TILL IT IS CONVERTED INTO A SYRUP A PORTION OF THIS SYRUP IS THEN DISTILLED EITHER IN GLASS OR PORCELAIN RETORTS OR WHAT IS BETTER THAN EITHER IN A SILVER ALEMBIC IRON RETORTS CANNOT BE EMPLOYED FOR THIS PURPOSE AS THE ACETIC ACID WHICH IS ALWAYS PRODUCED DURING DISTILLATION BY FORMING ACETATE OF IRON INSTANTLY DESTROYS THE LARIXINIC ACID BY CHANGING IT INTO A DEEPPURPLECOLOURED LIQUID WHEN A SILVER ALEMBIC CANNOT BE PROCURED A VERY CONVENIENT WAY OF DISTILLING THE EXTRACT OF THE LARCH IS TO POUR IT INTO A LARGE FLORENCE FLASK THE NECK OF WHICH IS PASSED OBLIQUELY THROUGH A CORK OR BUNG WHICH IS INSERTED INTO A GLASS CONDENSER WHEN THE FLASK IS CAUTIOUSLY HEATED ON A SANDBATH THE LARIXINIC ACID COMES OVER WITH THE FIRST PORTIONS OF THE LIQUID BUT BECOMES MORE ABUNDANT AS THE DISTILLATION PROCEEDS AND USUALLY FORMS LARGE FLAT CRYSTALS WHICH CONDENSE ON THE SIDES AND NECK OF THE RECEIVER THE LIQUID WHICH IS DISTILLED OVER AND WHICH CONTAINS THE GREATER PORTION OF THE LARIXINIC ACID SHOULD BE POURED INTO SMALL FLAT BASINS AND CAUTIOUSLY VCONCENTRATED AT ABOUT 60 CENT WHEN THE GREATER PORTION OF THE WATER HAS BEEN DISSIPATED IT IS ADVISABLE ESPECIALLY IN WARM WEATHER TO COMPLETE THE OPERATION BY SPONTANEOUS EVAPORATION FOR UNLESS THE CONCENTRATION OF THE AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF LARIXINIC ACID IS CONDUCTED CAUTIOUSLY THE LARIXINIC ACID VOLATILIZES ALONG WITH THE VAPOUR OF WATER AND IS THEREBY LOST THE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED SOLUTION OF LARIXINIC ACID OBTAINED IN THE WAY JUST DESCRIBED ON STANDING DEPOSITS BROWNISHYELLOW CRYSTALS WHICH ARE IMPURE LARIXINIC ACID THIS IS TO IBE PRESSED BETWEEN FOLDS OF BLOTTINGPAPER AND AGAIN TO BE CRYSTALLIZED OUT OF A SMALL IQUANTITY OF WATER THE LARIXINIC ACID MAY BE RENDERED PERFECTLY PURE BY SUBLIMING IT ONCE ORTWICE THIS IS EASILY EFFECTED BY PLACING THE LARIXINIC ACID BETWEEN TWO WATCH GLASSES OR IN ANY OTHER SUITABLE APPARATUS AND HEATING IT CAUTIOUSLY ON A SANDBATH OR EVEN ON A WATERBATH AS THE LARIXINIC ACID SUBLIMES AT THE VERY LOW TEMPERATURE OF 93 CENT THE LARIXINIC ACID IS A PROXIMATE PRINCIPLE WHICH EXISTS READY FORMED IN THE LARCH THIS IS EASILY PROVED BY DISTILLING EVEN A DILUTE INFUSION OF THE BARK WHEN THE LIQUID WHICH PASSES OVER WILL BE FOUND TO STRIKE A DEEP PURPLE COLOUR WITH A PERSALT OFDR STENHOITSE ON LARIXINIC ACID IRON WHICH IS VERY PERSISTENT THE BARK OF OLD LARCH TREES CONTAINS VERY LITTLE LARIXINIC ACID BUT THE BARK OF THE SMALL BRANCHES AND THAT OF THE STEMS OF THE LARCH WHEN NOT MORE THAN FROM TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CONTAINS VERY CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF THIS SUBSTANCE THE CONCENTRATED SYRUP FROM THE PORTIONS OF BARK YIELDING MORE LARIXINIC ACID THAN AN EQUAL WEIGHT OF CATECHU DOES OF OXYPHENIC ACID LARIXINIC ACID AFTER IT HAS BEEN PURIFIED BY SUBLIMATION FORMS BEAUTIFULLY WVHITE CRYSTALS OFTEN MORE THAN AN INCH IN LENGTH OF A BRILLIANT SILVERY LUSTRE VERY MUCH RESEMBLING BENZOIC ACID IN APPEARANCE THEY SUBLIME AT 93 CENT AND MELT AT 153 CENT BUT ITS AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS VOLATILIZE AT ORDINARY TEMPERATURES I AM INDEBTED TO THE KINDNESS OF PROFESSOR W H MILLER OF CAMBRIDGE FOR THE SUBJOINED MEASUREMENTS OF THE CRYSTALS OF LARIXINIC ACID  THE CRYSTALS OBTAINED BY SUBLIMATION BECOME ROUGH SO RAPIDLY WHEN EXPOSED TO THE AIR THAT VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE CAN BE PLACED IN THE FOL FI 1 LOWING RESULTS THE CRYSTALS BELONG TO THE OBLIQUE SYSTEM THEY USUALLY OCCUR IN TWINS LIKE THE ANNEXED FIGURE THEY ARE EXTREMELY THIN IN A DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO B DENOTING BY  M N FACES IN THE ZONE A B AND BY R A T A FACE IN

SMELL OF THE AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF LARIXINIC ACID IS SWEETISH LIKE THAT OF A SYRUP BUT THE SMELL OF THE SUBLIMED ACID IS VERY PECULIAR AND SLIGHTLY EMPYREUMATIC AS LARIXINIC ACID EMITS A SENSIBLE ODOUR AT ORDINARY TEMPERATURES IN THIS RESPECT IT CON 54DR STENHOUSE ON LARIXINIC ACID SIDERABLY RESEMBLES NAPHTHALINE AND ORDINARY CAMPHOR THE TASTE OF LARIXINIC ACID IS SLIGHTLY BITTER AND ASTRINGENT IT REDDENS LITMUS PAPER VERY SLIGHTLY BUT A SINGLE DROP OF POTASH OR AMMONIA WHEN ADDED TO A SOLUTION OF A LARGE QUANTITY OF LARISINIC ACID RENDERS IT ALKALINE LARIXINIC ACID IS VERY SOLUBLE IN BOILING WATER BUT IS BY NO MEANS VERY SOLUBLE IN COLD WATER 8788 PARTS OF WATER AT 15 C DISSOLVING 1 PART OF THE ACID ONLY BUT THE SOLUBILITY OF LARIXINIC ACID IN COLD AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS IS GREATLY INCREASED BY THE ADDITION OF EITHER ACIDS OR ALKALIES LARIXINIC ACID IS DEPOSITED FROM ITS AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS IN CRYSTALS WHICH ARE VERY BRITTLE AND OFTEN AN INCH OR TWO IN LENGTH IT LIKE WISE DISSOLVES IN COLD ALCOHOL BUT TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT IN HOT ALCOHOL THE CRYSTALS DEPOSITED FROM ITS ALCOHOLIC SOLUTIONS ARE THICKER AND MORE DISTINCTLY FORMED THAN THOSE FROM WATER IT ALSO DISSOLVES BUT SPARINGLY IN ETHER AND IS DEPOSITED IN CRYSTALS OF VERY CONSIDERABLE LUSTRE  THE FOLLOWING ARE THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE LARIXINIC ACID I 0221 SUBLIMED ACID DRIED IN VACUO GAVE 0A4633 CARBONIC ACID AND

PROPORTION OF C2 H1 O OR SOME MULTIPLE OF THESE NUMBERS C20 HI1 010 BEING THE NUMBERS WE HAVE ADOPTED AS THE MORE PROBABLE WHEN A QUANTITY OF LARIXINIC ACID WAS DISSOLVED IN A GREAT EXCESS OF LIQUID AMMONIA A YELLOWCOLOURED SOLUTION WAS PRODUCED WHEN THIS WAS EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS OVER SULPHURIC ACID IN VACUO THE LARIXINIC ACID WAS DEPOSITED IN CRYSTALS WHICH WERE NEARLY UNALTERED IT GAVE ITS CHARACTERISTIC REACTIONS WITH SALTS OF IRON AND WHEN BOILED WITH MILK OF LIME GAVE OFF NO TRACE OF AMMONIA THE COMBINATION WHICH LARIXINIC ACID FORMS WITH AMMONIA IS THEREFORE SO FEEBLE THAT IT IS DECOMPOSED BY THE VOLATILITY OF THE AMMONIA IN THIS RESPECT THEREFORE AND IN ITS FORMING NO HYDRATE LARIXINIC ACID CLOSELY RESEMBLES BOTH PYROGALLIC AND OXYPHENIC ACIDS WHEN LARIXINIC ACID WAS TREATED WITH AN EXCESS OF AQUA POTASSAE IT VERY READILY DIS SOLVED FORMING A YELLOWISH SOLUTION WHEN DRIED OVER SULPHURIC ACID IN VACTO THE POTASH COMBINATION FORMED LONG FLATTISH CRYSTALS HAVING CONSIDERABLE LUSTRE BUT OF A REDDISHBROWN COLOUR THESE CRYSTALS WHEN PRESSED BETWEEN FOLDS OF BLOTTINGPAPER TO FREE THEM FROM EXCESS OF POTASH AND RECRYSTALLIZED IN VACUO YIELDED CRYSTALS WHICH WERE MORE DEEPLY COLOURED THAN THE FIRST THIS POTASH COMBINATION IS SO VERY FEEBLE THAT  THE CRYSTALS OF LARIXINIC ACID CATCH FIRE READILY AND BURN WITH A BRIGHT FLAME LEAVING NO RESIDUE 55DT STENHOTUSE ON LARIXINIC ACID IT IS DECOMPOSED BY CARBONIC ACID IT CONTAINED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF POTASH BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN IT OF A CONSTANT COMPOSITION A SOLUTION OF LARIXINIC ACID GIVES NO PRECIPITATE EITHER WITH LIMEWATER OR WITH SACCHARATE OF LIME THE BEHAVIOUR OF LARIXINIC ACID WITH BARYTA IS EXTREMELY SINGULAR AND CHARACTERISTIC WHEN A SOLUTION OF CAUSTIC BARYTA IS ADDED TO A CONCENTRATED AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF LARIXINIC ACID THE LATTER BEING IN EXCESS A BULKY SEMITRANSPARENT GELATINOUS PRECIPITATE IMMEDIATELY FALLS AND IF THE SOLUTIONS ARE CONCENTRATED FILLS THE WHOLE VESSEL THIS PRECIPITATE WHICH CONSIDERABLY RESEMBLES HYDRATED ALUMINA IS BUT SLIGHTLY SOLUBLE IN COLD WATER BUT IT DISSOLVES VERY READILY IN BOILING WATER FROM WHICH IT IS AGAIN DEPOSITED ON THE COOLING OF THE LIQUID THIS BARYTA COMPOUND IS READILY DECOMPOSED BY CARBONIC ACID WHEN THROWN ON A FILTER AND WASHED THE AIR BEING CAREFULLY EXCLUDED IT WAS DRIED IN VACUO OVER SULPHURIC ACID AND WAS THEN FOUND TO CONTAIN AS THE MEAN OF TWO EXPERIMENTS 3492 PER CENT OF BARYTA A SOLUTION OF LARIXINIC ACID YIELDS NO PRECIPITATE WITH EITHER BASIC OR NEUTRAL ACETATE OF LEAD NEITHER IS IT PRECIPITATED BY NITRATE OR AMMONIONITRATE OF SILVER BUT WHEN ITS SOLUTION IN THE LATTER SALT IS BOILED THE SILVER IS REDUCED IN A PULVERULENT STATE LARIXINIC ACID FORMS NO PRECIPITATE WITH PERCHLORIDE OF PLATINUM EVEN ON THE APPLICATION OF HEAT IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY NITROGEN IT DOES NOT REDUCE OXIDE OF COPPER WHEN TRIED BY TROMMERS TEST  I TDISSOLVES IN CONCENTRATED SULPHURIC ACID BUT NO CONJUGATE COMBINA TION IS PRODUCED AS WAS ASCERTAINED BY NEUTRALIZING WITH CARBONATE OF BARYTA LARIXINIC ACID BEING OBTAINED UNCHANGED WHEN LARIXINIC ACID IS BOILED WITH A MIXTURE OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND CHLORATE OF POTASSA IT IS DECOMPOSED BUT WITHOUT THE FORMATION OF CHLORANILE WHEN IT IS BOILED WITH A SOLUTION OF HYPOCHLORITE OF LIME NO COLORATION IS PRODUCED IT IS READILY ATTACKED BY NITRIC ACID ESPECIALLY WHEN ASSISTED BY HEAT NITROUS FUMES ARE GIVEN OFF AND OXALIC ACID IS THE ONLY FIXED PRODUCT IT IS ALSO READILY ATTACKED BY BROMINE ESPECIALLY WHEN ASSISTED BY HEAT ABUNDANT VAPOURS OF HYDRO BROMIC ACID ARE GIVEN OFF THE LARIXINIC ACID BEING ENTIRELY DESTROYED AND CONVERTED INTO AN UNCRYSTALLIZABLE RESIN THE SALTS OF COPPER PRODUCE AN EMERALDGREEN COLOUR IN SOLU TIONS OF LARIXINIC ACID BUT NO PRECIPITATE CHLORIDE OF MANGANESE PRODUCES NEITHER COLORATION NOR PRECIPITATION PROTOSULPHATE OF IRON STRIKES A BROWNISHRED COLOUR WITH SOLUTIONS OF LARIXINIC ACID WHICH ACQUIRE A BRIGHTER RED COLOUR ON STANDING RESEM BLING MECONATE OF IRON PERCHLORIDE AND PERSULPHATE OF IRON PRODUCE A BEAUTIFUL PURPLE DAHLIACOLOUR WHICH IS VERY PERSISTENT AND STANDS DILUTION WELL ITS REACTIONS WITH SALTS OF IRON ARE VERY CHARACTERISTIC OF LARIXINIC ACID WHICH FORMS AN EXCELLENT REAGENT FOR THE DETECTION OF SALTS OF IRON EVEN IN VERY MINUTE QUANTITY IN THIS WAY THE PRESENCE OF IRON IN TOLERABLY PURE SULPHATE OF COPPER CAN READILY BE DETECTED BY THE PURPLE COLORATION PRODUCED LARIXINIC ACID DOES NOT AFFECT NEUTRAL PROTONITRATE OF MER CURY IN THE COLD AND ON THE APPLICATION OF HEAT NO MERCURY IS REDUCED LARIXINIC ACID APPEARS TOBE PECULIAR TO THE LARCH TREE AT LEAST I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A TRACE OF IT IN THE BARK OF THE SPRUCE FIR ABIES EXCELSA OR IN THAT OF THE SCOTCH FIR PINUS SYLVESTRIS LARIXINIC ACID EVIDENTLY BELONGS TO THAT SMALL GROUP OF SUBSTANCES 5657 DR STENHOUSE ON LARIXINIC ACID OF WHICH PYROGALLIC ACID AND PYROCATECHINE THE OXYPHENIC ACID OF GERHARDT ARE THE ONLY OTHER MEMBERS YET KNOWN LARIXINIC ACID IS MUCH LESS EASILY OXIDIZABLE THAN OXYPHENIC ACID WHICH AGAIN IS LESS EASILY OXIDATED THAN PYROGALLIC ACID LARIXINIC ACID VOLATILIZES AT A MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURE THAN EITHER OF THESE TWO SUBSTANCES FROM WHICH IT ALSO DIFFERS IN BEING A READYFORMED PROXIMATE PRINCIPLE AND NOT AN EDUCT ADDENDUMIN CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY FEEBLE IF NOT SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL ACID PROPERTIES OF THE SOCALLED LARIXINIC ACID PERHAPS THE NAME LARIXINE WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE BUT IN THAT CASE THE NAME OF PYROGALLIC ACID SHOULD BE ALTERED TO PYROGAL LINE AND THAT OF OXYPHENIC ACID TO PYROCATECHINE THE NAME ORIGINALLY GIVEN TO IT BY ZWENGER J S MDCCCLXII I

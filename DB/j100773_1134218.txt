ANTHROPOLOGYPSYCHOLOGYLEGAL MEDICINE Report of the New York Psychiatrical Society Re Clinical Psychologists At a meeting of the New York Psychiatrical Society held December 6 1916 a committee was appointed to inquire into the activities of psychologists and more particularly of those who have termed themselves clinical psy chologists in relation to the diagnosis and treatment of abnormal conditions This committee desires to make the following report We have been greatly impressed by the earnestness and success with which psychologists are endeavoring to make their science serviceable in deal ing with the practical affairs of everyday life We wish to record our belief in the wide usefulness of the application of psychological knowledge and of the findings of certain psychological tests in such fields as the modification of educational methods with reference to individual differences the vocational problems presented in various special industrial operations the development of scientific methods in advertising salesmanship and other means of business appeal and in the investigation of such special problems as the relation of environmental factors to the quality and quantity of the output of the in dividual We feel that the results to be attained in these fields justify the belief that the widening of the scope and application of psychological knowl edge will make psychology one of the most useful of the social sciences instead of a narrow field for study and research with but little actual contact with the practical problems of life We have observed with much distrust however the growing tendency of some psychologists most often unfortunately those with the least amount of scientific training to deal with the problem of diagnosis social management and institutional disposal of persons suffering from abnormal mental condi tions We recognize the great value of mental tests in determining many ques tions which arise in dealing with such patients but we have observed that most of such work which is being done by psychologists and particularly by persons whose training in psychology is confined entirely to learning how to apply a few sets of these tests is carried on in schools courts correctional institutions and socalled psychological clinics quite independently of med ically trained workers who are competent to deal with questions involving the whole mental and physical life of the individual We believe that the scientific value of work done under such conditions is much less than when carried on in close cooperation with that of physicians and that serious disadvantages to patients suffering from mental disorders and to the community are likely to result and in many instances which have come to our attention have resulted This is especially true when the mental con dition of the patients examined involves questions of diagnosis loss of liberty or educational issues more serious than redistribution of pupils or rearrange ment of courses of study In spite of these facts two states have enacted laws permitting judges to commit mentally defective persons to institutions upon the socalled expert testimony of clinical psychologists regarding the abnormal mental conditions from which patients are alleged to suffer We believe that the examination upon which a sick person is involuntarily committed to perma nent institutional custody is one of the most serious responsibilities assumed by physicians and that in no cases whatever should it be entrusted to persons without training enabling them to take into consideration all the medical factorsANALYSIS OF SIGNATURES 267 involved The same is true of mental examinations of juvenile delinquents and criminals whose whole careers depend in many cases upon the determina tion of their condition We desire to make the following specific recommendations 1 We recommend that the New York Psychiatrical Society affirm the general principle that the sick whether in mind or body should be cared for only by those with medical training who are authorized by the state to assume the responsibility of diagnosis and treatment 2 We recommend that the Society express its disapproval and urge upon thoughtful psychologists and the medical profession in general an ex pression of disapproval of the application of psychology to responsible clinical work except when made by or under the direct supervision of physicians quali fied to deal with abnormal mental conditions 3 We recommend that the Society disapprove of psychologists or of those who claim to be psychologists as a result of their ability to apply any set of psychological tests undertaking to pass judgment upon the mental condition of sick defective or otherwise abnormal persons when such findings involve questions of diagnosis or affect the future care and career of such persons CHARLES L DANA Chairman ADOLF MEYER THOMAS W SALMON Logical Analysis of Subscribed SignaturesEvery signature which is subscribed must be either of the true name or not of the true name of the writer If the signature is of the true name of the writer it must have been written either with or not with the intent to thereby identify the writer If the signature is of the true name written with the intent to identify the writer it will have no conscious or voluntary variation from the usual and customary manner or style of signature automatically natural to the writer under the conditions under which the signature is written To make it other wise would be but to surely defeat the very intent of the signer If the signature is that of the true name but is not written with the intent that it shall identify the writer it may be written in one of the three follow ing ways Firstly if there be simply an absence of afy active intent that it shall identify the writer the signature will be automatically written in the usual and customary style natural under the circumstances under which the writing is made Secondly if there be but a moderately active intent that the signature shall not identify the writer he will seek to modify his conscious habits which he recognizes as affecting the general pictorial appearances of his signature in so far as he can control them and deems it necessary to accomplish his object Thirdly if there is a strong positive intent that the written signature shall not identify the writer he will to the best of his ability and understanding not only endeavor to write the signature so dissimilar to that of his own usual and customary automatic hand that it shall not only be not taken to be his signature but will even from its marked sim ilarity to the usual style of signature of another particular person be taken to have been written by that person If the signature is however not that of the true name of the writer it ANALYSIS OF SIGNATURES 267

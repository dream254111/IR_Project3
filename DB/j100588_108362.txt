J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108362,ON A GENERAL METHOD IN ANALYSIS,I206999, 225  VIII ON A GENERAL METHOD IN 4NALYSIS BY GEORGE BOOLE ESQ COMMUNICATED BY S HUNTER CHRISTIE ESQ SEC RS SFC RECEIVED JANUARY 12THREAD JANUARY 18TH MUCH ATTENTION HAS OF LATE BEEN PAID TO A METHOD IN ANALYSIS KNOWN AS THE CALCULUS OF OPERATIONS OR AS THE METHOD OF THE SEPARATION OF SYMBOLS MR GREGORY IN HIS EXAMPLES OF THE DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL CALCULUS AND IN VARIOUS PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE CATNBRIDGE MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL VOLS I AND II HAS BOTH CLEARLY STATED THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE METHOD IS FOUNDED AND SHOWN ITS UTILITY BY MANY INGENIOUS AND VALUABLE APPLICATIONS THE NAMES OF M SERVOIS ANNALES DES MATH6 MATIQUES VOL V P 93 MR R MURPHY PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 18373 PROFESSOR DE MORGAN C SHOULD ALSO BE NOTICED IN CONNECTION WITH THE HISTORY OF THIS BRANCH OF ANALYSIS AS I SHALL ASSUME FOR GRANTED THE PRINCIPLES OF THE METHOD AND SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO REFER TO VARIOUS THEOREMS ESTABLISHED BY THEIR AID IT MAY BE PROPER TO MAKE SOME GENERAL REMARKS ON THE SUBJECT BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION MR GREGORY LAYS DOWN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE METHOD IN THESE WORDS C THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THEOREMS IN ORDINARY ALGEBRA WHICH THOUGH APPARENTLY PROVED TO BE TRUE ONLY FOR SYMBOLS REPRESENTING NUMBERS ADMIT OF A MUCH MORE EX TENDED APPLICATION SUCH THEOREMS DEPEND ONLY ON THE LAWS OF COMBINATION TO WHICH THE SYMBOLS ARE SUBJECT AND ARE THEREFORE TRUE FOR ALL SYMBOLS WHATEVER THEIR NATURE MAY BE WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAWS OF COMBINATION THE LAWS OF COMBINATION WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN RECOGNISED ARE THE FOLLOWING R AND G BEING SYMBOLS OF OPERATION U AND V SUBJECTS 1 THE COMMUTATIVE LAW WHOSE EXPRESSION IS TRGUTRU 2 THE DISTRIBUTIVE LAW ZRUV TUTRV 3 THE INDEX LAW RXMNU R MNU PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE THIRD LAW DOES NOT RATHER EXPRESS A NECESSITY OF NOTATION ARISING FROM THE USE OF GENERAL INDICES THAN ANY PRO PERTY OF THE SYMBOL R THE ABOVE LAWS ARE OBVIOUSLY SATISFIED WHEN R AND E ARE SYMBOLS OF QUANTITY THEY ARE ALSO SATISFIED WHEN Z AND G REPRESENT SUCH SYMBOLS AS D A C IN COMBI NATION WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH CONSTANT QUANTITIES THUS 2 G2MR BOOLE ON A GENERAL METHOD IN ANALYSIS D AUAU A DU DYV D THESE PROPERTIES OF THE SYMBOL 7 TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRINCIPLE ABOVE ENUNCIATED LEAD TO THE MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS THAT HAVE BEEN YET ESTABLISHED BY THE CALCULUS OF OPERATIONS WE HAVE AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF THEIR APPLICATION IN THE SYM BOLICAL FORM OF TAYLORS THEOREM VIZ D ATH S F A RESULT TO WHICH WE SHALL OFTEN REFER IS THE FOLLOWING IF WE HAVE A LINEAR EQUA TION WITH CONSTANT COEFFICIENTS OF THE FORM RNU AL7RN LU A2N2U  ANUX WHEREIN R OPERATES SOLELY ON U AND IS THEREFORE COMMUTATIVE WITH RESPECT TO A1 A2 C THEN UATR1 A22 AN 1X NL A1LXXN2RA2LX C N1 N2 A A2 HAVING THE SAME VALUES AS IN THE RESOLUTION OF THE RATIONAL FRACTION INTO A SIMILAR SERIES OF TERMS IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE ABOVE METHOD IS OF NECESSITY LIMITED IN ITS APPLICATION IT IS ONLY IN LINEAR EQUATIONS WITH COMSTANT COEFFICIENTS THAT THE OPERATIVE SYMBOLS COM BINE IN SUBJECTION TO THE LAW WE HAVE SUPPOSED ACCORDINGLY IT HAS BEEN REMARKED THAT THE CALCULUS OF OPERATIONS HAS TENDED RATHER TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESSES OF ANA LYSIS THAN TO EXTEND ITS POWER THE OBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEVELOPE A METHOD IN ANALYSIS WHICH WHILE IT OPE RATES WITH SYMBOLS APART FROM THEIR SUBJECTS AND MAY THUS BE CONSIDERED AS A BRANCH OF THE CALCULUS OF OPERATIONS IS NEVERTHELESS FREE FROM THE RESTRICTIONS TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED THE LINEAR EQUATION WITH VARIABLE COEFFICIENTS WHETHER IN DIFFERENTIALS OR IN FINITE DIFFERENCES WILL BE TREATED UNDER THE FORM FOR UJRFRE2RU  C U U BEING A FUNCTION OF THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE X AND X AND G OPERATIVE SYMBOLS WHICH COMBINE IN SUBJECTION TO THE LAW F9 RF7MU AND WHICH WHEN THE SUBJECT FUNCTION U IS UNITY FURTHER SATISFY THE RELATION ARMFMR IT MIGHT BE EXPECTED A PRIORI THAT A THEORY OF LINEAR EQUATIONS FOUNDED ON SUCH A CAMBRIDGE MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL VOL II P 114 VOL III P 239 226MR BOOLE ON A GENERAL METHOD IN ANALYSIS BASIS WOLLLD BE OF PECULIAR CHARACTER ITS ACTUAL ADVANTAGES I CONCEIVE TO BE THE FOLLOWING 1 THE NECESSARY REDUCTIONS TRANSFORMATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS ARE EFFECTED FOR THE MOST PART BY THEOREMS THE EXPRESSION OF WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE FORMS OF FOOR FL4R C 2 WE ARE THUS ABLE TO ESTABLISH A PERFECTLY GENERAL METHOD FOR THE SOLUTION OF LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS TOTAL AND PARTIAL IN SERIES AND FOR THE CALCULUS OF GENE RATING FUNCTIONS 3 THE FORM OF THE ANALYSIS AFFORDS FACILITIES WHICH ARE BELIEVED TO BE PECULIAR TO ITSELF FOR THE FINITE INTEGRATION OF LINEAR EQUATIONS AND FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF IN TEGRABLE FORMS THE RECEIVED THEORY OF THE SOLUTION OF LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IN SERIES IS GIVEN BY EULER IT CONSISTS IN ASSUMING UZAMXM AND DETERMINING BY SUBSTITUTION THE RELATION CONNECTING THE SUCCESSIVE VALUES OF A OR AS IT IS CALLED THE SCALE OF THE EQUATION THIS METHOD FAILS WHEN IN SEEKING THE FIRST INDEX OF A DEVELOPMENT WE ARRIVE AT EQUAL OR IMAGINARY VALUES I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY MATHEMATICIAN HAS SHOWN HOW THIS FAILURE IS TO BE REMEDIED NOW THE METHOD DEVELOPED IN THIS PAPER HAS NO SUCH CASES OF EXCEPTION THE THEORY OF SERIES AND OF GENERATING FUNCTIONS HAS BEEN SUCCESSIVELY DISCUSSED BY EULER AND LAPLACE A FULL ACCOUNT OF THEIR RESEARCHES IS GIVEN IN LACROIXS LARGER TREATISE ON THE CALCULUS TORN III IN THE CHAPTERS THDORIE DES SUITES AND THDORIE DES FONCTIONS GDNDRATRICES I CLASS THESE INVESTIGATIONS TOGETHER BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THEIR OBJECTS ARE DISTINCT THEIR MATHEMATICAL THEORIES ARE VIRTUALLY THE SAME EULER PROPOSES TO DETERMINE THE GENERATING FUNCTION OF A SERIES 2UMTM WHEN THE COEFFICIENTS ARE FORMED ACCORDING TO SUCH A LAW AS THE FOLLOWING  AM BAM 4 BL   M  CM ECLM EL   HE SHOWS THAT BY SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENTIATIONS AND INTEGRATIONS THE FACTORS AM B CME MAY BE ELIMINATED AND THE PROBLEM FINALLY REDUCED TO THE SOLUTION OF A DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION LAPLACET CONSIDERING THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY U IN AN EQUA TION OF DIFFERENCES AS THE GENERAL COEFFICIENT OF THE EXPANSION OF A FUNCTION U PROPOSES TO DETERMINE U AND THEN BY EXPANSION TO OBTAIN U IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR US TO CONSIDER HERE WHETHER THE THEORY OF GENERATING FUNCTIONS IS OF ANY IM PORTANCE TO THE SOLUTION OF EQUATIONS OF DIFFERENCES THE DISCOVERY OF THE GENE RATING FUNCTION OF A SERIES IS IN ITSELF A PROBLEM BOTH INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT THOSE WHO HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT WILL I THINK ADMIT THAT THE THEORIES BY WHICH EULER AND LAPLACE HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECT LABOUR UNDER TWO DEFECTS ONE ARISING FROM THE TEDIOUS CHARACTER OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE DIF FERENTIAL EQUATION IS FORMED THE OTHER FROM THE DIFFICULTY OF ITS INTEGRATION THIS DOES BY NO MEANS DEROGATE FROM THE GENIUS OR THE CLAIMS OF THOSE WONDERFUL MEN  CALC INTEG VOL II T TH6ORIE DES PROBABILITES

THE ADVANTAGES WHICH THE METHOD OF THIS PAPER IS BELIEVED TO POSSESS AS RESPECTS THE THEORY OF SERIES ARE THE FOLLOWING 1 THE LAW OF THE SERIES BEING KNOWN OR THE EQUATION OF DIFFERENCES GIVEN THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION IS KNOWN BY INSPECTION THE RULE IS ABSOLUTELY GENERAL WHATEVER MAY BE THE FORMS OF THE COEFFICIENTS 2 THE FORM UNDER WHICH THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION IS PRESENTED OFFERS GREAT FACILI TIES FOR ITS INTEGRATION THOSE FACILITIES ARE CHIEFLY OWING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE FORM OF THE EQUATION PERMITS US AS BEFORE REMARKED TO EFFECT THE REQUISITE TRANS FORMATIONS BY GENERAL THEOREMS THAT THIS FORM HAS A PECULIAR FITNESS FOR THE PRO CESSES OF INTEGRATION IS FURTHER SHOWN BY THE CIRCUMNSTANCE THAT THE METHOD OF RESO LUTION WHICH IN THE COMMON THEORY LEADS TO THE SOLUTION

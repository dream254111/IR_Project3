function of the age in which it flourishes The ancient academies accomplished a work now performed by the universities The Italian academies of the Renaissance variously estimated at from 500 to 700 in number represent different purposes al most as numerous as the institutions them selves But in general they were literary and scientific clans they belonged to a period when learning was the possession of the few to a period when one might still take all science for his domain The modern academy is as a rule closely allied with the sovereign power of some state whose interests are promoted by it consciously and unconsciously in a variety of ways The service which it renders is sometimes political sometimes literary sometimes scientific sometimes social But so far as I can see they all have in common these two ends namely the encouragement of the individual and service to the community The triple purpose of the Illinois State Academy of Science is clearly stated in the second article of its constitution as being the promotion of scientific research the diffusion of scientific knowledge and of the scientific spirit and the unification of the scientific interests of the state just how this object can best be secured is the inter esting subject of an afterdinner discussion this evening I leave this problem therefore with the 1 Presidential address delivered before the Illi nois Academy of Science at Peoria February 21 1913N S VOL XXXVII No 952 single remark that the importance of cul tivating individual initiative and of hand ing on to the community the best there is in the achievements of science is not likely to be overestimated Symonds2 points out that Athens and Florence owed their wonderful intellec tual artistic and literary success mainly to the fact that they nourished the indi viduality of their citizens while Sparta and Venice comparatively barren of per manent results illustrate the lack of such encouragement I now invite your attention to one of the earliest members of the venerable and thankworthy Academy of the Lyncei a man who represents in the highest degree the individuality then cultivated in Tus cany a man whose impress upon his stu dents was so deep that shortly after his death they united to form one of the most productive and justly celebrated of all the Italian academies3 a man whose written works fill twenty splendid quarto volumes4 a man who in his efforts to put before the people the best science of his times en dured opposition criticism disgrace and social ostracism throughout most of his thinking life I refer to Galileo But I shall speak only of what he did in physics because I believe this phase of his work is too little known What Galileo saw through telescopes of his own make though not of his own in vention is so familiar that possibly a majority of intelligent men think of him mainly as an astronomer The spots on the sun the mountains on the moon the 2 Renaissance in Italy Vol I p 234 8

hereafter as Nat Ed satellites of Jupiter the phases of Venus the triple character of Saturn the solar rotation period lunar libration and earth shine are some of the celestial phenomena associated with the name of Galileo These and his brilliant defense of the Copernican system are responsible for the impression that his accomplishments are chiefly astro nomical To another large group of men he stands mainly for liberty intellectual social and religious These men classify him with Giordano Bruno and De Dominis and Cam panella who also had some experience with the cardinals of the Inquisition For them Galileo is the man who dared to differ with Aristotle the man who brushed aside the mists of philosophy the man who banished church traditions from his thinking while he calmly pursued his search after unity in the physical universe5 It is doubtless his splendid stand for spiritual freedom which leads Goethe6 in his historical sketch of optics to say Even though he never seriously studied the sub ject of color I must at least adorn my page with his name But there is still a third group of men to whom the great Italian appeals most strongly because he has given them a new method of working and thinking a new viewpoint a new apermu To put this con tribution in its proper perspective is not an easy matter we are too near it and too familiar with it If however one consid ers the time interval between Archimedes and Kelvin he can not fail to notice a sharp discontinuity in the progress of physics occurring about the beginning of the sev 1For a masterly presentation of this

commerce and industry led up to and prepared the way for this step is the subject of a most inter esting chapter by a member of this acad emy Professor Mann7 Without underestimating the contribu tions of Pappus or Tartaglia or Benedetti or Stevinus or Leonardo da Vinci to me chanics and without denying the impor tant role of statics in architecture and in other structural work one may I believe fairly say that the years which intervene between Archimedes and Galileo are prac tically barren of progress in physics It is true indeed that during this in terval a large number of isolated physical facts had been discovered indeed there is scarcely a chapter in physics in which some advance of this type can not be mentioned but during all this while nothing in the way of development is seen individual discoveries remain isolated they do not bear fruit speculation and guessing were still employed where we use observation and measurement and computation Leonardo da Vinci likens a scientific con quest to a military victory in which theory is the field marshal experimental facts the soldiers The philosophers who pre ceded Galileo had in the main been try ing to fight battles without soldiers The only possible exceptions to this statement are Roger Bacon Leonardo da Vinci Stevinus and Gilbert They had measured some mechanical quantitiesa few of them masses and stressessuch as could be obtained by means of a steelyard and a measuring stick but they were still in the domain of statics Now from a geomet rical esthetic or even utilitarian stand point it is difficult to imagine any finer subject than graphical statics and yet when we regard the progress of physics Mann Teaching of Physics pp 107110 Macmillan 1912 statics is to dynamics somewhat as osteol ogy is to physiology a veritable valley of dry bones The live part of mechanics is kinetics the study of masses which are in motion the consideration of bodies which are changing their velocities currents of water oscillating magnets vibrating strings rotating wheels electric motors heat engines electromagnetic waves and Xrays These are the problems over which men lose sleep these are the ques tions which compel the interest of the physicist these are the subjects whose mas tery confers power upon the engineer The one confessed aim of physical science is indeed to describe the motion of bodies in the simplest possible manner Indeed it is only by the aid of this modern science of the energy of motion that any of the ancient mechanical doctrinessuch as the atomic theory of Democritushave ac quired validity it is this same science which has rendered the heliocentric theory of Copernicus not merely a plausible view but the one possible view We pass now to a more definite ques tion namely what contribution did our Academician make to the solution of problems of this type to the science which now goes by the name of physics To answer briefly and baldly he instituted the method and set into motion the machinery by which practically all these problems have been solved in so far as they have been solved at all But lest I give the false impression that Galileo was the an cestor of all the physical sciences I hasten to a more detailed answer of the query What did Galileo 1 First no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that Galileo was the first man to differ with Aristotle the academy of Cosenza having opposition to the peripatetic philosophy as its avowed purpose was established at Naples about 465 MARCH 28 1913466 SCIENCE the time when Galileo was born but he was the first man to offer experimental evidence against the conclusions of Aris totle and in so doing he established what we now call the experimental method He was not handing on an opinion which some dustyminded professor had inherited from an ancestor of the same type Only two methods of investigation were known to the ancients the philosophical and the mathematical to these Galileo added a third the experimental The philosophical method consisted in assuming certain general principles and trying to find in them an a priori explanation of the universe Briefly described the attempt was to stare nature out of countenance Failure was inevitable not for want of intellectual acumen but because as every one in this assembly knows it sometimes requires a lifetime of effort to explain a single detail Witness almost any chapter in Darwins  Origin of Species Details must be mastered before one can pass to general principles The mathematical method consisted only in applying geometry to certain well known areas volumes and angles espe cially to those angles observed in the sky but always with the idea of describing the known rather than of discovering the un known the mathematicians do not appear to have put any deliberate questions to nature or as Rowland said A mathematical investigation always obeys the law of the conservation of knowledge we never get out more from it than we put in The knowl edge may be changed in form it may be clearer and more exactly stated but the total amount of the knowledge of nature given out by the investi gation is the same as we started with The experimental method established mainly by Galileo not only combines the observations of the philosophers with the measurements of the mathematicians but N S VOL XXXVII No 952 adds deliberate experiment with a distinct purpose to interrogate nature concerning some detail of her behavior Generaliza tions based upon these details the experi menter reserves for a later date The high regard in which Galileo held experimental facts is reflected in the following from a letter8 to the Grand Duchess Christina dated 1615 He says I would entreat these wise and prudent fathers to consider diligently the difference between opinionative and demonstrative doctrines to the end that they may assure themselves that it is not in the power of professors of demonstrative sci ences to change their opinions at pleasure Or witness the following paragraph from the Saggiatore9 as illustrating the great weight which Galileo attached to ex perimental evidence He says We examine witnesses in things which are doubtful past and not permanent but not in things which are done in our presence If discussing a difficult problem were like carry ing a weight then since several horses will carry more sacks of corn than one alone I would agree that many reasoners avail more than one but discoursing is like coursing and not like carrying and one barb by himself will run faster than a thousand Friesland horses In all his thinking nothing is exempt from experiment Astronomy even in his hands ceases to be a purely observational science for when he wishes to discover whether the bright portions of the moons surface are rough or smooth he sets up two surfaces one rough and one smooth then illuminates them with Italian sun light Desiring to learn at what rate fall ing bodies gain speed he devises a time measuring machine invents a method of diluting gravity and actually measures the rate at which speed is gained His dis cussions begin and end with experiment I Nat Ed Vol 5 p

dialoguesone dealing with astronomy the other with mechanics abound in experimentsmost of them apt and clever Leonardo da Vinci advo cates experiment Galileo uses experiment 2 The second great achievement of Gali lei was his seizure upon momentum as the fundamental quantity in the science of mechanics and his demonstration that velocity is a factor in momentum Galileo was by no means the first to study and dis cuss kinematical problems B3enedetti 15301590 one of the many distinguished alumni of the University of Padua had not only expressed dissatisfac tion with the artificial distinction between violent and natural motions but had gone farther and had paved the way for mechanics and the differential calculus by recognizing the fact of continuous varia tion in motion Benedetti1 had in partic ular studied oscillatory motion and had shown that such a motion is continuous even when the vibrating particle is at rest at the end of its path He had in fact introduced the modern idea of continuous variation But none of the predecessors of Galileo had so far as I have been able to discover pushed their study of inoving bodies beyond the mere consideration of change of position None of them had recognized the inertia of the moving body as a fundamentalperhaps the funda mentalfact of mechanics Princes and paupers for ages had stumped their toes against bricks and stones they were doubtless quite as familiar as we with the mere fact of inertia But to Galileo it was a cardinal fact because he was the first to see that the future history of a body de pends upon its possession of inertia To  Lasswitz Atomistik IBd 2 pp 1423 gives a good description of Benedettis work 467 him the importance of a motion is in gen eral measured by the inertia involved or as was then saidthe weight involved Hence he assigned to the product of the weight and velocity of a body the name momentum which is merely the Latin word for importance as a synonym he sometimes uses the word impetus thus emphasizing the impetuosity of motion But Galileo never got beyond the point where he measured inertia by weight as indeed engineers still doall at least except electric engineers The invention of the idea of mass was reserved for New ton Even Huygens who first mastered the idea of centrifugal force never got beyond the point where he measured cen trifugal forces in terms of weight thus avoiding the conception of mass in all his work Those who wish to see just how clearly Galileo conceived that the future behavior of a body is connected with its inertia should read those propositions in his Mechanics 12 in which he calculates the path of a projectile by assuming that the horizontal speed of a shot after it has left the muzzle of a gun continues to be uni form His repeated use of this principle makes it perfectly clear that he discovered what we now calland perhaps properly callNewtons first law of motion Gali leo failed to generalize it by extending it to all bodies whether subject to the earths gravitation or not This Newton did be cause he had acquired the new concept of massthat constant property which never deserts a body in any position or condition 3 The next great step which Galileo 1 Huygens Horologium Oseillatorium  Part V Prop 13 or Hobart School Science and Mathematics Vol 11 p 692 1911 for trans lation of Huygens s paper Galileo Dialogues on Motion Fourth Day Problem I et seq MARCH 28 1913SCIENCE made was the discovery of the constant factor in the motion of falling bodies One of his earliest experiments performed while still a young man at the University of Pisa was to allow a bronze ball to roll down a carefully prepared inclined plane an experiment from which he cleverly in ferred that while the position and speed of the ball were changing the timerate at which it gained momentum remained con stant It was with reference to these par ticular experiments that Goethe remarked den Genie ein Fall fiir tausend gelte The experiment is completed by showing how one can compute the momentum or speed of a body after it has been falling for any given time or through any given distance In all these computations the unit of momentum employed is that which a body acquires in falling freely through an arbitrarily selected unit of distance As illustrating how tenaciously he clings to the idea of momentum witness the fol lowing clear exact and thoroughly modern definition dating from the year 160413 I call a motion uniformly accelerated when starting from rest its momentum or degree of speed increases directly as the time measured from the beginning of the motion Observe that we have here without any mention of the word precisely the dynam ical idea which we today use under the name of a constant force There is indeed no necessity for the name for Galileo attempts nothing more than to dis cover how the momentum of a body changes owing to the presence of another body such as the earth in the neighborhood action at a distance or owing to contact with an elastic body such as the hot gases of exploding gunpowder in the barrel of a gun action through a medium Later generations had not yet beclouded the idea of force with tendencies to motion they lNat Ed Vol II p 166 had not yet identified it with that vastly more complex muscular sensation they had not yet made it over in the form of a man they had not yet named it an agent they had not yet identified it with a state of stress or strain which one elastic body exhibits when held perma nently at rest by another elastic body still less had there been any attempt to con vince peopleprincipally highschool lads and college studentsthat all these various things are one and the same since for sooth at various times we call them by one name force Some of Galileos most worthy successors such as Clifford14 Poin care15 and Hertz have pointed out our inconsistent definitions of force and have advocated in the most outspoken manner a return to the simple methods of this Italian academician The best known of all his experiments is of course that in which he proves that the time of fall is independent of weight an experiment which completes to a first approximation the laws of falling bodies practically as we have them today He accomplishes a second approximation by eliminating the buoyant force of the me dium He is prevented from making a third approximation only because he meets the barrier of viscosity a barrier which still renders impossible the solution of any but a few simple cases in fluid motion The one remaining fundamental phe nomenon of falling bodies is that the ac celeration of gravity is independent of the substance of which the falling body is com posed This Galileol6 proved by swinging side by side two pendulums having bobs 14Clifford Nature Vol 22 p 122 1880  Poincare lecture before the Wissenschaftlich Verein in Berlin p 116 Teubner 1912 1Nat Ed Vol 8 pp 128130 First Day translated into German by von

ampli tudes they had equal velocities at each point of their path It is difficult to find in Newtons hollow pendulum experiment much more than a second approximation in which he eliminates the air resistance from this experiment of Galileo 4 The fourth advance which we owe to Galileo is the observation that the momen tum communicated to a body in one direc tion does not alter its momentum in a direction at right angles This indepen dence of components of momenta now known as Newtons second law of motion was in the hands of Galileo no mere philo sophical theorem no vague guess but a practical rule of action to be employed in mechanical operations It is by com pounding a uniform horizontal velocity with an accelerated vertical velocity that he proves for the first time that the path of a projectile is a parabola It was by means of this principle that he prepared a range table for gunners The fact is then that Galileo discovered and employed the first two of Newtons laws essentially as we use them today It requires more than sheer strength to climb a difficult mountain peak one must start in on the right trail More than mere intellectual ability is needed to make an important discovery in physical science one must start in with the correct view point This viewpoint is precisely what Aristotle lacked and exactly what Galileo possessed It is Gomperz17 the distin guished historian of Greek thought who says The physical doctrines of Aristotle are a dis appointing chapter in the history of science They 17 Greek Thinkers Vol 4 p 108 Berry s translation display to us an eminent mind wrestling with problems to which it is in no wise equal 5 As a minor achievement of Galileo allow me to mention some discoveries to which he blazed a part of the road In a letter to a friend he says he had spent more years in the study of philos ophy than weeks in mathematics It is therefore extraordinarily surprising to find set forth in his Dialogues on Motion18 all the detailed facts and ideas which are involved in the modern definition of an infinite quantity developed by Boltzano Canlor and Dedekind viz an assemblage containing a part which may be put into onetoome correspondence with the whole Again he paves the way in a very dis tinct manner for the differential calculus in pointing out that the definitions19 of constant velocity and constant accelera tion hold only when the times considered are all whatsoever If therefore one wishes to employ these definitions in the discussion of variable motion he must take his time intervals indefinitely small The invention of the wellknown thermo scope which Galileo employed in his lec tures at Padua also belongs here for while it is not a true thermometer it doubtless led immediately to those exquisite sealed instruments shortly afterwards constructed by the Accademia del Cimento and still preserved in the Tribuna di Galileo at Florence The theory of dimensions first stated by Fourier was led up to in the First Day of the Dialogues on Motion The principle employed in his measure ment of the density of air20 is one which is not only faultless in principle but one which makes it plainly evident that Gali leo had properly conceived that idea of atmospheric pressure which in the hands 8 First Day Nat Ed Vol 8 p 78 19 Third Day Nat Ed Vol 8 p 191 20 Nat Ed Vol 8 p 124 First Day SCIENCE 469470 SCIENCE of two of his students led to the invention of the barometer and in the hands of von Guericke to the air pump Torricelli knew well the Dialogues on Motion 6 Finally Galileo was an inspiring teacher and built up at Padua a great school of physics Many of his students lodged under his own roof helped him in his own garden ate at his own table He had his own workshop and employed his own mechanicians Generous with his time his energy and his money master of a fine literary style endowed with a keen sense of humor familiar with the bestthat had been said and thought in the world standing in the front rank of investigators is it any wonder that young men of talent hastened to Padua from all parts of Europe Could any higher compliment be paid to a teacher than the devotion exhibited by the youthful Viviani a lad in his teens for his master already some seventy years old and a Prisoner in Acetri  If deferred payments of the kind that teachers mostly depend upon ever get as far as the next world surely this courageous spirit harried throughout his long life by poverty illhealth and the censorship of the church must have been gratified by the work of the Accademia del Cimento which was with the exception of a single man composed entirely of his students Mechanics was the one subject to which he was devoted consistently and persistently throughout his life it was the subject of his earliest investigation when a young man at Pisa the subject upon which he lectured when in his prime at Padua the subject of his latest and most mature reflection at Arcetri His most important contribution to dynamics was published in the seventythird year of his age If in conclusion I were asked to sum marize in a single sentence the principal contributions of Galileo to the science of N S VOL XXXVII No 952 physics I should mention the two follow ing facts 1 That knowledge of physical phenomena which is to receive imper sonal verification and become useful must be obtained mainly by experiment adapted to ask of nature some particular question 2 That momentum considered as a function of time and position is a fundamental dynamical concept or in other words to discover how the change of momentum of any body is connected with the physical circumstances in which the body is placed is the one great problem of dynamics But perhaps after all his most impor tant contributions lie outside of physics Indeed Galileo has not yet shot his last arrow For his life still teaches us that nothing is so because any man says it is so His example still shows how experiment can rob a man of all arrogance of opinion how familiarity with unsolved problems can give a man genuine humility and how on the other hand the possession of clear experimental evidence arms him with sure confidence Critics tell us that Florence during the Renaissance shone with a borrowed light a light reflected from Athens But I venture to think that those who will take the pains to look over the pages of Galileo will find them selfluminous HENRY CREW NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FACTS AND FICTION ABOUT CROPS THE Association of Official Agricultural Chemists of the United States at

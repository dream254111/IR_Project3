where obstacles now exist Furthermore the desirable cooper ation between investigators would become a much simpler matter to arrange than it is now Every laboratory for research would become a nucleus around which individual enterprises might cluster each giving and receiving help A great work wisely planned always attracts colaborers its mere suggestiveness is enough to provoke widespread intellectual activity Here there is no monopoly no limit to competi tion no harmful rivalry every research is the seed of other researches and every ad vance made by one scholar implies the ad vance of all In the realm of thought we gain by giving and the more lavish our offerings the richer we become We glory in the achievements of chem istry and we find merit also in its imper fections for they give us something more to do Never can the work be finished never can all its possibilities be known Hitherto the science has grown slowly and irregularly testing its strength from step to step and securing a sure foothold in the world Now comes the time for better things for system for organization for transforming the art of investigation itself into something like a science The endow ment of research is near at hand and the results of it will exceed our most sanguine anticipations F W CLARKE U S GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 4RADED CONDENSATION IN BENZINE VA POR AS EVIDENCED BY THE DISTORTED CORONAS AND MARKED AXIAL COLOR EFFECTS ATTENDING CLOUDY CONDENSATION 1 It would be difficult to read the ad mirable work on the relation of rain and atmospheric electricity which has issued from the Cavendish Laboratory without being convinced of the strength of the argu ments put forth That in a repetition of these researches in particular of the ex periments of C T R Wilson on the com parative efficiency as condensation nuclei of positively and negatively charged ions one would but reproduce his results ad mits of no doubt In so important a question however it is none the less desirable to reach identical conclusions from entirely different methods of approach It has been part of my pur pose to be driven to like inferences in other words to reach a point in my work where I should have to abandon the nucleus as an agency which for purely mechanical or thermodynamic reasons facilitates con densation and be compelled to recognize the special activity due to its charge I had hoped to accomplish this in the following experiments with benzine when contrasted with the corresponding be havior of water but the results contrary to my expectation are so curious and pro nounced an accentuation of the nuclear theory that it seems worth while to spe cially describe them 2 The work originated in the following point of view if the action promoting con densation is in any degree of a chemical nature such suppositions have been made the production of hydrogen superoxide for instance has been suggested then there should be a marked difference in the effi cacy of the same nucleus when the satu rated water vapor is replaced by the vapor of some electrolytically neutral liquid like a hydrocarbon I accordingly made a series of experiments with benzine en deavoring at first to utilize benzine jet and color tube in the usual way In this I failed for reasons without much relevant interest here I then adopted the method of adiabatic cooling partially exhausting a spherical receiver Coulier Kiessling about 23 cm in diameter illuminated by  C T R Wilson Phil Trans London Vol CXCIII pp 289308 1899 SCIENCE 175N S VOL XV No 370 white light diverging from an external point In this way not only were copious fogs obtained but the coronas produced were additionally available as evidence In the benzine jet particles are probably cooled too suddenly and at once attain a size incompatible with axial color effects Using the exhaustion method however these axial colors appearing in benzine are not only of pronounced depth but they run into higher orders than in the case of moist air subjected to like exhaustions Sequences passing through blue green yellow brown purple etc green brown etc may be seen in the axis of a column only 23 cm long The reason no doubt is the lower latent heat of benzine insuring the formation of drops not less uniform but of a size caet par regularly larger than for water vapor The fact that axial colors are producible both with water and with a pronounced insulator like benzine is a result of fundamental importance in its bearing on any theory adduced to account for the axial absorption in question 3 The exhaustion experiments were thus at once successful Cloudy condensation was as densely produced in benzine vapor as in water vapor with phosphorus flame and other nuclei Care was taken to in sure dryness of vessel by test experiments both before the benzine was introduced and after it had been quite removed by evapo ration The exhaustion of about one sixth say 13 cm seemed best adapted to bring  For some time I have been making experi ments with the coronas of cloudy condensation on a large scale with the purpose of comparing the diffraction colors so produced with the axial colors of the steam jet The latter are almost complementary to the colors of the central patches of the corresponding coronas betraying a difference of origin in the two cases of great theoretical interest One is tempted to infer that the light axially absorbed illuminates the colored inner circle of the corona but the proof of such an assertion is a long stride out the following phenomena When the receiver was left standing overnight no marked condensation occurred in the ab sence of nucleation or else the condensa tion was rain like a fine mist falling about 2 or 3 cm per second The introductory experiments were made with light nearly in parallel the suns image being used as a coronal center The even dense tawny benzine fog after the first nucleation was expected to develop on subsequent exhaustions each followed by an influx of filtered air into the magnifi cent coronas which characterize this ex periment in the case of water vapor On the contrary however the fogs were more fleeting showed a more rapid descent than aqueous fogs and the color fields obtained were not ringshaped as expected but sharply stratified horizontally roughly speaking in alternations of green and red Moreover if the exhaustions were made successive without influx of air between each the colors rose in strata from below as they fell in strata when left to them selves On mounting the strata grew suc cessively wider and thinner till they van ished from sight brown yellowwhite being the last colors observed Uniform color fields strata of limiting width were eventually producible in this way Yellow brown crimson arose from a whitish blue base then descended again on completed exhaustion reminding one of the extension of an accordion The speed of apparent viscous subsidence of the top bands has no direct meaning since fall or rise is here complicated by evaporation On entrance of air vortices were evi denced by ringshaped threads of color so that mixture was at first inevitable One must wait till this ceases before again ex hausting Convection currents due to local reheating of the adiabatically cooled gas by the walls of the receiver were equally apparent stringy colors rising on the out SCIENCE 176JANUARY 31 1902 side and descending into the middle of the receiver It is the phenomenon which in terferes with the usefulness of narrow tubular apparatus 4 As this subsidence of color bands in benzine vapor is an observation of impor tance I resolved to repeat the work under more normal conditions Accordingly I used as my source of light the bright area of the mantle of a Welsbach burner seen through a small hole in the metallic screen by an eye looking centrally through the receiver containing saturated benzine vapor and nucleated air Punk nuclei replaced the phosphorus nuclei On exhaustion without nucleation after standilg over night the coronas were white centered fringed with brown about as large as ordi nary lycopodium coronas seen under like conditions These large drops are a proof of the relative absence of nuclei initially After nucleation the first dense fogs were vaguely annular during the first five successive exhaustions filtered air being supplied between each The next five ex haustions produced more nearly finally very fully stratified colors in spite of the point source of light Shaking the receiver violently at any time so as to scatter the liquid benzine within always reproduced a nearly perfect corona which on standing became distorted again in color at least I now made special experiments shaking the receiver before each observation bringing out successive coronal effects never as per fect as with water however always show ing the tendency to stratification The characteristic coronas succeeded each other so rapidly that it would be difficult to make them out Nuclei however were still pres ent after over two hours the eventually white centered coronas showing a continued shrinkage to smaller diameters in accord ance with the diminishing number of nuclei These will be described for water vapor in a subsequent paper present Twenty exhaustions did not re move them Here as above therefore the fleeting character of the coronas their tendency to depart from the normal annular charac ter into stratification the speed of descent of the color bands their rise upward on exhaustion like a fog from a lake are the special characteristics of the colored cloudy condensation occurring in benzine To these are to be added the striking axial colors mentioned above 5 To explain the above phenomena in their variation from the normal aqueous corona it is first necessary to account for the more rapid subsidence of nuclei I am not aware of appreciable differences of vis cosity in the two vapors but benzine has the smaller latent heat of evaporation by over seven times Hence under identical conditions of nucleation and for like ex haustions or like adiabatic cooling of a given mass of saturated air the drops would be larger the colors more advanced in benzine than in water and since the square of radius is in question this would point to subsidence of the loaded nuclei in benzine nearly four times more rapid It would also account for more rapid evapor ation or more fleeting colors which is the case Again if the loaded nuclei be regarded as mechanical particles the largest will eventually be found in the lower strata the smallest in the upper strata as in a case of ordinary subsidence of suspended matter in water It is well known more over that smaller droplets wane larger droplets grow Hence on increasing ex haustion condensation takes place first at the bottom and last at the top since the smallest nuclei correspond to greatest vapor pressure or difficulty in condensa tion and since the largest nuclei have been loaded with condensed liquid first have parted with it last have had greater time SCIENCE 177178 SCIENCE in falling and have therefore sunk deep est before losing their liquid load The strata mount upward as fresh exhaustion proceeds The last colors to appear are the browns and yellows of the first order also seen in the steam tube for vanishing con densations The whole phenomenon is thus the result of strata of invisible nuclei graded in virtue of the loading mechanism and partakes throughout of a mechanical character to the extent that the nuclei are not even a uniform product The forced distribution is sufficiently powerful to en tirely mask the elementary optical phe nomenon On shaking the liquid benzine in the receiver uniform distribution is again pro moted with the result that annular coronas reappear It is particularly to be noticed that subsidence is due to loaded nuclei The free nucleus does not appreciably de scend Even with water vapor loading does not produce stratification Water fogs when exceptionally dense may sometimes  Since writing the above I have made similar experiments with benzol reaching the additional result that nuclei are produced by the liquid it self spontaneously in the dark They ascend against gravity in horizontal strata at the rate of 2 or 3 cm per sec in the lower hemisphere They may be completely precipitated by partial exhaustion leaving the air in the vessel free from nuclei but the above flask will be refilled to sat uration in 10 or 20 minutes The experiment may be repeated any number of times The sharp demarcation of the pure air above from the rising surface of nuclei is beautifully evidenced by the coronas which are annularly perfect for axial beams below the surface asymptotically bowl shaped at the surface and absent for axial beams above the surface Shaking produces the coronas from pure air instantly but these are usually smaller In so far as the spontaneous coronas have fixed diameters for fixed exhaustions supersatur ation the number of nuclei eventually reaches a maximum or saturation Among many interest ing problems growing out of the present observa tions the corresponding behavior of water is most important N S VOL XV No 370 be seen to rise but the diffraction pat tern is always annular and usually with out color distortion CARL BARUS BROWN UNIVERSITY PROVIDENCE R I DATA ON SONG IN BIRDS THE ACQUISI TION OF NEW SONGS THE purpose of this paper is to set forth the evidence that has come under the writers personal observation regarding the propensity of birds to acquire new methods of expression in song This faculty may be properly divided into three categories First the disposi tion of wild birds to interpolate new phra sing into what may be called their normal song or to acquire new songs Second education of expression by direct teaching from man to birds in confinement Third the propensity of caged birds to imitate voluntarily sounds that attract their attention The evidence under the first division of this thesis is absolute and also well known However a few special cases may serve to emphasize the matter Every trained field ornithologist dis criminates individuality in song and some have been so fortunate as to have noted wide and radical departures from what I have distinguished as the normal song The slight variation from the normal is of too common occurrence to be dwelt on here Suffice to say that as set forth in a previous paper in this journal most observers recognize degrees of excellence in the songs of wild birds of the same kind Again a few observers have heard wild birds imitate or produce not only the songs of other birds but also the barking of dogs human speech and mechanically produced sounds such as the creaking of a wheel the filing of a saw and the like The facility See SCIENCE October 4 1901 p 522

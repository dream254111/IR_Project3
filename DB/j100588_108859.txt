J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108859,THE LIGNITES AND CLAYS OF BOVEY TRACEY DEVONSHIRE,I207017, 1019  XXXIX THE LIGNITES AND CLAYS OF BOVEY TRACEY DEVONSHIRE BY WILLIAM PENGELLY F GS COMMUNICATED BY SIR CHARLES LYELL FRS RECEIVED NOVEMBER 16READ NOVEMBER 21 1861 THE LITTLE TOWN OR VILLAGE OF BOVEY TRACEY IN DEVONSHIRE NESTLES AT THE FOOT OF DART MOOR VERY NEAR ITS NORTHEASTERN EXTREMITY IT IS SITUATED ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE RIVER BOVEY ABOUT TWO MILES AND A HALF ABOVE THE POINT AT WHICH IT FALLS INTO THE TEIGN AND IS ABOUT ELEVEN MILES FROM EACH OF THE TOWNS EXETER TORQUAY AND TOTNES BEARING SOUTHWESTERLY FROM THE FIRST NORTHWESTERLY FROM THE SECOND AND NORTHERLY FROM THE LAST A CONSIDERABLE PLAIN STRETCHES AWAY FROM IT IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION HAVING A LENGTH OF SIX MILES FROM A POINT ABOUT MILE WEST OF BOVEY TO ANOTHER NEARLY AS FAR EAST OF NEWTON ITS GREATEST BREADTH FROM CHUDLEIGH BRIDGE ON THE NORTHEAST TO BLACK POOL ON THE SOUTHWEST IS FOUR MILES IT FORMS A LAKELIKE EXPANSION OF THE VALLEYS OF THE TEIGN AND BOVEY RIVERS ESPECIALLY THE LATTER WHOSE COURSE IT MAY BE SAID TO FOLLOW IN THE HIGHER PART WHERE IT IS MOST FULLY DEVELOPED WHILST THE TEIGN CONSTITUTES ITS AXIS BELOW THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO STREAMS ITS UPPER OR NORTHWESTERN PORTION IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE IS KNOWN AS  BOVEY HEATHFIELD AND MEASURES ABOUT 700 ACRES ON ITS WEST AND NORTHWEST RISE THE LOFTY GRANITE HILLS OF DARTMOOR WITH THEIR BORDER OF METAMORPHIC ROCKS ON THE NORTH THE TRAPPEAN ELEVATIONS OF HENNOCK ON THE NORTH EAST AND EASTE THE GREENSANDS OF THE ALDONS AND THE TRAPS AND LIMESTONES OF THE CHUDLEIGH AND KINGSTEIGNTON DISTRICTS AND ON THE SOUTH THE TRAPS DEVONIAN LIME STONES AND ASSOCIATED ROCKS EXTENDING FROM NEWTON TOWARDS ASHBURTONT CONTRASTED WITH THIS RUGGED AND ELEVATED COUNTRY THE SOCALLED  PLAIN  IS NOT WITHOUT SOME CLAIM TO THE APPELLATION THOUGH BY NO MEANS CHARACTERIZED BY EVENNESS OF SURFACE SHAFTS AND OTHER EXCAVATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE DEPOSITS IN THIS BASIN CONSIST OF AN ACCUMULATION OF COARSE GRAVEL MIXED WITH SAND AND CLAY OF VARIABLE THICKNESS UNCON FORMABLY COVERING DISTINCT STRATA OF LIGNITE CLAY AND SAND WHICH ARE FAMILIAR TO GEOLOGISTS AS THE  BOVEY DEPOSIT WHILST THE LIGNITE IS EQUALLY WELL KNOWN AS  BOVEY COAL THIS DEPOSIT NOT ONLY OCCUPIES THE PLAIN WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BUT IS CONTINUED IN A NARROW SOUTHERLY PROLONGATION FROM NEWTON TO NEAR KINGSKERSWILL ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MILES FROM TORBAY THIS ENTIRE PROLONGATION IS A DIVERGENCE FROM THE TEIGN WHERE IT CROSSES THE ESTUARY OF THAT RIVER IT IS ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM THE COAST THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE EXCAVATIONS IS THAT KNOWN AS THE  COALPIT WHICH IS SITUATED ON THE HEATHFIELD SOMEWHAT LESS THAN A MILE SOUTH OF THE VILLAGE AND ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE WESTERN MARGIN OF THE DEPOSIT IT IS OPEN TO THE DAY AND  THE DISTANCES THROUGHOUT ARE MEASURED IN STRAIGHT LINES ON THE ORDNANCE MAPS T SEE MAP PLATE LII 6Z MDCCCLXIIMR PENGELLY ON THE LIGNITES AND IS IN FORM A RUDE PARALLELOGRAM HAVING ITS LONGEST SIDE ABOUT 960 FEET IN THE DIRECTION FROM S 75 E TO N 75 W WHILST THE SHORTEST MEASURES 340 FEET AND HAS A BEARING OF N 35 E TO S 35 W ITS GREATEST DEPTH AT THE WESTERN END IS NEARLY 100 FEET SUBTERRANEAN EXCAVATIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON VERY EXTENSIVELY IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS BY MEANS OF TUNNELS OPENING OUT OF THE PIT AT ITS BOTTOM AT PRESENT THE WORKING IS CONFINED TO ONE TUNNEL EXTENDING 190 FATHOMS ALMOST IN A STRAIGHT LINE IN THE DIRECTION N 65 W FROM THE WESTERN END OF THE PIT THE LIGNITE WAS FORMERLY USED IN LARGE QUANTITIES IN AN ADJOINING POTTERY AT PRESENT BUT LITTLE IS EMPLOYED THERE AND ITS USE IS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONFINED TO THE POORER COT TAGERS OF THE IMMEDIATE DISTRICT A VERY OFFENSIVE SULPHUROUS SMELL WHICH IT EMITS DURING COMBUSTION PREVENTS ITS GENERAL DOMESTIC USE THE REFUSE MATTER CONSISTING OF CLAY AND WASTE OR VALUELESS LIGNITE IS LODGED ON THE SURFACE AROUND THE PIT IRONPYRITES OCCURS IN IT IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES AND SPON TANEOUS COMBUSTION IS COMMON IN FRESH REFUSE ESPECIALLY AFTER MUCH RAIN THE FIRE IS NOT GENERALLY VISIBLE NEAR THE SURFACE IN THE DAYTIME BUT ITS PRESENCE IS INDICATED BY SMOKE AND THE VERY OFFENSIVE ODOUR PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CRACKS HAVING THEIR SIDES LINED WITH FLOWERS OF SULPHUR CROSS THE BURNING MASS IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS OCCASION ALLY CRYSTALS OF SULPHATE OF ALUMINA ARE ALSO FORMED THE ATTENTION OF BOTH THE SCIENTIFIC AND THE COMMERCIAL WORLD HAS LONG BEEN CALLED TO THIS DEPOSIT SEVERAL ACCOUNTS OF IT HAVE BEEN LAID BEFORE VARIOUS LEARNED SOCIETIES AND OTHERWISE GIVEN TO THE WORLDT MANY OF THESE BESIDES DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CHARACTERS  THE BEARINGS ARE IN ALL CASES MAGNETIC WHEN EXPRESSED AS

DEVONSHIRE AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE STRATA CONTAIN SPECULATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS ON VARIOUS TOPICS ESPECIALLY THE MINERAL OR VEGETABLE ORIGIN OF THE LIGNITE THE MODE IN WHICH THE MATE RIALS OF THE DEPOSIT WERE ACCUMULATED AND THE PLACE OF THE FORMATION IN THE CHRONOLO GICAL SERIES OF THE GEOLOGIST THESE MAY BE SAID TO HAVE RESULTED IN A SETTLED CONVICTION THAT THE LIGNITE IS OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN THAT THE CLAYS AND SANDS HAD BEEN FURNISHED BY THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE DARTMOOR GRANITE AND THAT THE WHOLE IS OF SUPRACRETACEOUS AGEAND A GENERAL BELIEF THAT THE PLANTS HAD NOT GROWN ON BUT HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED TO THE AREA THEY NOW OCCUPY THE EXACT CHRONOLOGY OF THE FORMATION WAS BY NO MEANS AGREED ON FURTHER THAN THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE A PREVALENT BUT VAGUE OPINION THAT GEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING IT WAS VERY MODERN THE ONLY DEFINITE EXPRESSION THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN ON THE QUESTION WAS THE PROVISIONAL ONE THAT THE DEPOSIT BELONGED TO THE POST PLIOCENE EPOCH THIS WAS BASED ON A CONE SAID TO HAVE BEEN FOUND IN ONE OF THE UPPER MOST BEDS OF LIGNITE AND WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED BY DR HOOKER AS BELONGING TO THE SCOTCH FIR PINUS SYLVESTRIS  THIS AND SOME SMALL SEEDVESSELS DESCRIBED BY DR HOOKER UNDER THE NAME OF FOLLICULITES MINUTULUS WERE THE ONLY IDENTIFIABLE FOSSILS WHICH PRIOR TO THE LATE EXPLORATIONS HAD BEEN FOUND AT BOVEY INDEED SO RECENTLY AS 1839 SIR H DE LA BECHE STATED THAT EXCEPTING THE LIGNITE ITSELF NO ORGANIC REMAINS HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE DEPOSITT MANY GEOLOGISTS HOWEVER WERE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THIS CHRONOLOGY AS CONCLUSIVE NOR WERE THEY WITHOUT HOPES THAT ON A CAREFUL AND THOROUGH EXAMINATION BEING MADE THE BEDS MIGHT BE FOUND TO CONTAIN FULLER AND MORE RELIABLE EVIDENCE ON THE QUESTION DURING THE SPRING OF 1860 DR FALCONER MADE SEVERAL VISITS TO BOVEY AND VARIOUS LOCALITIES IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE CLAYWORKS WERE OR HAD BEEN CARRIED ON THE RESULT WAS A STRONG IMPRESSION THAT THE DEPOSIT WOULD BE FOUND TO BELONG TO THE MIOCENE PERIOD IN ONE OF THESE VISITS HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE REV R EVEREST FGS AND COLLECTION OF SPECIMENS OF THE LIGNITE MADE BY THE LATE DR CROKER SOON AFTERWARDS DR FALCONER INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT TO MISS BURDETT COUTTS AS ONE WHICH FOR THE CREDIT OF BRITISH GEOLOGY IT WAS EMINENTLY DESIRABLE TO HAVE VERY FULLY INVESTIGATED AFTER A VISIT TO THE BOVEY  COALPIT MISS COUTTS WITH CHARACTERISTIC LIBERALITY FURNISHED ME WITH MEANS TO

OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT THE LIGNITEBEDS HAVING SUFFERED LESS FROM THE WEATHER THAN THE IINTERSTRATIFIED CLAYS AND SAND STAND OUT IN RELIEF LIKE A SERIES OF RUDE MOULDINGS ON THE WALL OF THE PIT

THAN ABOUT 5 FEET THE FACT HOWEVER THAT THEY ARE NOT PRESENT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT IT AMOUNTS TO THIS BY REMOVING 460 FEET FURTHER INTO THE ANCIENT BOVEY LAKE FOR SUCH I ASSUME THE AREA TO HAVE BEEN460

PREVIOUSLY OCCURRED MOREOVER ON THIS HYPOTHESIS IT IS REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT SAND WOULD HAVE BEEN LARGELY DEPOSITED IN FUTURE INSTEAD OF WHICH THE OLD ORDER OF CLAY AND LIGNITE ALTERNATELY IS CONTINUED FOR EIGHTEEN ADDI TIONAL BEDS INCREASING THE DEPTH OF THE DEPOSIT BY NEARLY 40 FEET INDEED OMITTING THE TWO ARENACEOUS BEDS 9TH AND LLTH WHICH OCCUR ONLY IN THE FIRST SECTION WE HAVE NO MORE

TOTAL DEPTH BELOW THE SURFACE IS 99 FEET THE SYMBOLS HAVE THE SAME MEANING IN BOTH A IS THE  OLD ENGINESHAFT B THE EASTERN END OF THE  COALPIT  56 FATHOMS WEST OF A C MR DIVETTS  BORING  70 FATHOMS EAST OF A D 80 FEET BELOW THE SURFACE IS A HORIZONTAL EXCAVATION VERY NEAR THE ENGINESHAFT AND OPENING EASTWARD OUT OF A WORKING WHICH RUNS PARALLEL AND ADJACENT TO THE  FAULT SEE FIG 2 E F IS THE HYPOTHETICAL PLANE OF THE  FAULT WITH THE OMISSION OF A FEW UNIMPORTANT LOCAL DIFFERENCES THE WESTERN SECTION REPRE SENTS THE ASCERTAINED SUCCESSION AND THICKNESS OF THE BEDS FROM A TO NEARLY HALF A MILE WESTWARD THEY ARE PROBABLY CONTINUED MUCH FURTHER IN THIS DIRECTION BUT ARE KNOWN TO TERMINATE EASTWARD ABRUPTLY AT THE FAULT EF IMMEDIATELY EAST OF A THE LOWEST BED SHOWN IS THE 62ND IN THE PIT SECTIONS THE EASTERN SECTION IS DRAWN FROM THE DATA OBTAINED IN MR DIVETTS BORING AT C P 1033 AND SHOWS ALL THE BEDS CUT THERE THESE ARE ASSUMED TO EXTEND IN THE SAME ORDER WESTWARD TO E F AND THOUGH NO EXCAVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE SURFACE IN THE INTERMEDIATE SPACE THE ASSUMPTION IS BY NO MEANS GRATUITOUS SINCE A BED OF SAND HAVING THE SAME CHARACTERS AND AT THE SAME DEPTH BELOW THE SURFACE HAS BEEN MET WITH BOTH IN THE  BORING C AND THE EXCAVATION D THOUGH THE EXISTENCE AND SITUATION OF THE  FAULT  HAS BEEN WELL ASCERTAINED THE ANGLE WHICH ITS PLANE  E F MAKES WITH THE HORIZON IS NOT SO WELL KNOWN IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPLETE EVIDENCE ON THIS POINT IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT BEST TO DRAW IT AT RIGHT ANGLES MORE ESPECIALLY AS THE EVIDENCE SO FAR AS IT GOES IS TO THAT EFFECTU OARPOFM J DAD APJ

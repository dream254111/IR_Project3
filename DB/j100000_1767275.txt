names in  the pedigree of human thought GEORGE BRUCE HALSTED 2407 Guadalupe Street Austin Texas Nesting of the RoadRunner THIS very peculiar longtailed bird is common here throughout the year It inhabits mainly the broad arroyos covered with chapparal thickets and scruboaks as here is found its principal food small snakes and lizards The breeding season is from the middle of March to the last of July The number of eggs laid varies in this locality from three to nine though usually four to seven The eggs are pure white covered with a thick chalky coating which is often found partly scratched off The nests are built in thick chapparal bushes or scrub oaks from two to five feet from the ground They are composed of coarse sticks placed roughly across the supporting branches to the thickness of about two inches and a diameter of ten inches Over this platform is placed a layer of sage leaves and twigs forming a shallow saucershaped depression Then last but invariably is placed in the depression a small amount of dry horsemanure broken into small pieces I do not know the reason of this last addition but it is nevertheless an invariable constituent of the RoadRunners nest The nest of the Burrowing Owl presents the sane peculiarity though with an apparent reason The nest cavity of the Bur rowing Owl is always partly filled with green horsemanure In this case the decaying vegetable matter probably forms heat enough to carry on the incubation But in regard to the Road Ranners nest I do not see the necessity of the dry horsemanure I would be pleased to hear from any one who is acquainted with the nesting habits of the RoadRunner JOE GRINNELL Pasadena Cal Ad Ignorantiam THE calumniators of Professor Wright have been fully met and an animus for their attack suggested There are some critics remaining who have used an argument not found in logic that 4 ad ignorantiam  with freedom and to the users with telling effect A few words as to this argument may not be inopportune A can neither recognize the peculiarly shaped pinnacles on the top of a glacier from day to day nor can he remember the names of the people who are introduced to him at the receptions to which he goes B can do both readily and states his ability todo so Thereupon 0 jumps up and says that it is impossible to B to speak the truth as it is notorious that A can do neither and A is an authority on all subjects A finds it impossible on Monday to stake out the surface of a slippery sidewalk and publishes the fact On Tuesday B comes along with knit socks over his boots and makes that sidewalk look like a dressmakers pin cushion When this fact is published the ubiquitous C springs up and tells how often the frame of A subsided in the attempts and therefore B never did what he claims to have done A whole tribe of As fail to find Truth at the bottom of the well all oldauthorities to the contrary notwithstandingand thereupon dogmatize to the effect that she is not there or if there is a pal impsest edition introduced by exOlympian means When B shins down the rope and brings up the damp and coy dame he is met by shrieks of C to the effect that he carried her down in his pocket because all the As aided by the strongest microscopes could not locate her within seven rows of apple trees of the place It may strike people as rather funny for men who have said that certain things do not exist to prove that they do not exist by failing to find them It is not their business to find them or rather it would seriously hurt their business to find them They cannot adduce their ignorance or inability against the knowl edge and power of others who have done what they have failed to do and what they wished to fail to do The writer does not think many of the questions as fully 247 settled as they might be but he does not propose to believe a man because he poses as an ignoramus EDWARD H WILLIAMS JR Bethlehem Penn April 14 Color in Flowers IN reply to the inquiry on p 179 will say that the preservation of colors in flower is fully explained in Professor Baileys Horti cultural Rule Book F H PLUMB Springfileld Mass April 20 BOOKREVIEWS Idle Days in Patagonia By W H HUDSON New York D Appleton  Co VIII 256 p 8 THE author of  The Naturalist in La Plata reviewed on a previous occasion in these columns has given us in the present volume another interesting book At first sight the title seems somewhat misleading inasmuch as the author met with an acci dent a few days after his arrival in the country and was confined to the house for a considerable period As however he says the book would probably never have been written if the original in tentions in visiting the country had been carried out we may consider the accident a lucky one His Idle Days gave him ample time for thought and in this as in the previous volume we have many original ideas The most of the time was spent in the valley of the Black River and in his chapter upon the valley we note a fact that may be of interest at the present time in view of the controversy going on in relation to palaeolithic man in America In wandering along the banks of the stream he found many arrowheads on the ancient village sites They were of two widely different kinds  the large and rudely fash ioned resembling the palaeolithic arrowheads of Europe and the highlyfinished or neolithic arrowheads of various forms and sizes but in most specimens an inch and a half to two inches long Here there were the remains of the two great periods of the Stone Age the last of which continued down till the discovery and colonization of the country by Europeans The weapons and other objects of the latter period were the mlost abundant and occurred in the valley the ruder and more ancient weapons were found on the hillsides in places where the river cuts into the plateau The site where I picked up the largest number had been buried to a depth of seven or eight feet only where the water after heavy rains had washed great masses of sand and gravel way the arrowheads with other weapons and implements had been exposed These deeply buried settlements were doubt less very ancient He found that to the inhabitants of the valley the river was all in all Beyond its banks spread the gray desolate desert within the valleys bounds were light and life Just as all things were mirrored in its waters so was the stream reflected in the minds of the people Even the European colonists says he I have not been unaffected psychologically by the peculiar con ditions they live in and by the river on which thay are de pendent When first I became cognizant of this feeling which was very soon I was disposed to laugh a little at the very large place  the river occupied in all mens minds but after a few months of life on its banks it was hardly less to me than to others and I experienced a kind of shame when I recalled my former want of reverence as if I had made a jest of something sacred Nor to this day can I think of the Patagonian river merely as one of the rivers I know Other streams by compari son seem vulgar with no higher purpose than to water man and beast or to serve like canals as a means of transport So powerfully did the river impress the native minds that they be came incapable of imagining any place to be habitable without it In one chapter we have an account of the habits of several breeds of dogs A Scotch collie was found to take kindly to the wild life in the desert and soon became the leader of the ordinary dogs But four purebreed grayhounds when tired of moping about the house would take to the desert and course on their own MAY 5 I893

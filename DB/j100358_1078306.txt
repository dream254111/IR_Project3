in the measurement of accomplishment in school subjects have for the most part concerned the elementary school For a variety of reasons the investigation of problems in the methods and technique of high school work has lagged far behind Any contribution to this latter field is therefore doubly welcome and the recent survey of Latin instruction in New Hampshire is one which will assuredly prove suggestive as a pioneer study of this sort The purpose of this investigation was stated to be the testing and evalua tion of present aims methods and practices in     the teaching of Latin in secondary schools Seven problems were selected for attack among them questions as to the extent to which the schools are now succeeding in producing a mastery of the Latin language the methods proving most successful in prac tice the relation of knowledge of grammar and vocabulary to ability in transla tion and the relation of time spent to results achieved No attempt was made to settle the broader issues as to the educational value of Latin and its place in the curriculum but the findings inevitably throw some light upon such questions For purposes of the investigation four tests were devised and evaluated a continuous passage from Caesar of which pupils were to translate as much as possible in fifteen minutes a scale of twenty sentences for rendering into Eng lish with unlimited time a similar scale of grammatical constructions which the pupil was asked to explain and a vocabulary of fifty Latin words to be identified Twentynine schools were examined and each test was applied to from eight hundred to two thousand individuals The results were such as fully to justify the contentions of many of the bitterest critics of Latin in our schools The sentence scale for example revealed that at the end of four years of Latin instruction the average pupil can translate just over six of the easiest of twenty sentences all of about the difficulty of those in a beginners text On the connected passage from Caesar pupils at the end of the fourth year showed an average ability to write in  H A BROWN A Study of Ability in Latin in Secondary Schools Oshkosh Wis consin State Normal School 1920 Pp xI70 229230 THE SCHOOL REVIEW March English in fifteen minutes the thought of a little less than fifteen lines of Latin with about eight and a half lines correct  The test on grammar gave twenty sentences with translation supplied each illustrating a single familiar construc tion In more than half the schools firstyear classes failed to average a single answer correct The average score of fourthyear pupils from all schools indicated an ability to explain just seven of the twenty examples Only in the vocabulary test was any fair measure of success achieved and this is important chiefly as pointing the moral that mere ability to recognize words does not make an intelligent translator In all the tests progress shown in the upper years is remarkably small If allowance could be made for the elimination so strongly operative among Latin students these returns might be interpreted as meaning no real advance whatever above the second year The report is curiously silent upon this point so significant in its bearings on the whole The findings of most immediate practical interest are doubtless in those sections of the report which compare the results obtained from different teaching practices The principal issue is the justification in educational returns for the large amount of time devoted in many schools to the study of Latin grammar To obtain light upon this the schools were classified in three groups of eight each Group I includes those schools which follow most closely the socalled  translation method Group III those which lay most stress upon grammar and syntax The results of the tests were decidedly in favor of the former It is perhaps not surprising that pupils in these schools should show marked superiority in the translation of connected prose but many will find it strange that they were also during the first three years at least abreast of Group III in ability to explain grammatical constructions When to these points are added figures showing that schools employing the grammatical method devote approximately 25 per cent more time to the subject the relative inefficiency of this method becomes strikingly manifest It is how ever interesting to remark one fact nowhere commented upon in the text The schools of Group II made up of those which follow Group III in placing chief emphasis in the first year upon formal grammar but later shift to rapid translation achieve results almost uniformly superior to either of the other groups in all tests save that of connected translationeven there their record runs a close second to Group I It must be admitted though that this superi ority is achieved at a somewhat disproportionate cost in time The number of schools examined was of course too small for any findings to be final A study of the records of graduates from these schools in their subsequent university courses in Latin indicates pretty clearly however that the quality of their previous instruction has been above rather than below the country average When consideration is given the further fact that the investigators have discarded results from schools or classes exceptional by reason of particularly gifted or deficient teachers the striking agreement in the indications obtained must assuredly command respect

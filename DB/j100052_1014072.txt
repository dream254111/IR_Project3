J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014072,FOOD CONDITIONS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,I242681,FOOD CONDITIONS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION BY DR HUBER SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE MUNICH TRANSLATED BY E M FOGEL PHD UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA BEFORE THE WAR THE GERMAN PEO PLE IMPORTED A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THEIR FOODSTUFFS AND FEEDS CONSID ERING THE NOT ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE NAT URAL CONDITIONS OF SOIL AND CLIMATE GERMAN AGRICULTURE PROGRESSED ALMOST AS RAPIDLY AS GERMAN INDUSTRY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FEED THE CONSTANTLY INCREASING POPULATION WITH HOME PROD UCTS ESPECIALLY SO BECAUSE THE POPULA TION WAS DRIFTING TO THE CITIES IN GREATER AND GREATER NUMBERS THE EXPORT OF MANUFACTURES AND THE PROFITS FROM GERMAN SHIPPING AND FROM OTHER GER MAN ENTERPRISES PAID FOR THE FOODSTUFFS IMPORTED AND THE RAW MATERIALS AND AIDS IN PRODUCTION ROHUND HILFSMITTEL REQUIRED FOR OUR INDUSTRIES NOT ONLY WERE VERY CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF GRAIN ANIMAL FATS AND DAIRY PRODUCTS IMPORTED FOR IMME DIATE HUMAN CONSUMPTION BUT IN THE DECADE PRECEDING THE WAR INCREASINGLY LARGE QUANTITIES OF FERTILIZERS TO PROMOTE GREATER SOIL PRODUCTIVITY AND FEEDS BARLEY CORN LINSEEDCAKE FOR STOCK RAISING AND MEAT PRODUCTION WERE IMPORTED ALTHOUGH WE IMPORTED VIR TUALLY THE SAME QUANTITIES OF WHEAT AND ONLY A LITTLE MORE OF CATTLE AND MEAT 6 PER CENT OF THE TOTAL MEAT CONSUMPTION ACCORDING TO PROFES SOR WARMBOLD GERMAN AGRICULTURE BEFORE THE WAR FURNISHED DEDUCTING THE FOOD PRODUCED BY THE AID OF IMPORTED FERTILIZERS AND FEEDS ABOUT 90 PER CENT OF OUR VEGETABLE FOODS 67 PER CENT OF OUR MEATS AND FATS 50 PER CENT OF OUR MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS AND 70 PER CENT OF OUR POULTRY THAT IS TO SAY ABOUT ONESIXTH OF OUR POPULA TION DEPENDED ON FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR FOOD THE WAR AGGRAVATED THE FOOD PROB LEM IN TWO WAYS FIRST THE ENEMY BLOCKADE STOPPED THE IMPORTATION OF FOOD AND RAW MATERIALS FOR AGRICUL TURAL PURPOSES ALMOST ENTIRELY FURTHER MORE DOMESTIC AGRICULTURE WAS SO DERANGED THAT IN SPITE OF EVERY UTMOST EFFORT IT COULD NOT MAINTAIN ITS FORMER PRODUCTION THE WAR TOOK AWAY 40 PER CENT OF THE BEST MALE LABOR AND THE SAME PROPORTION OF HORSES AND CAT TLE USED ON THE FARMS AND THE LOSS WAS NOT PERMANENTLY COMPENSATED BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN CHILDREN AND PRISONERS OF WAR ON THE FARMS SECONDLY WE LACKED FERTILIZERS FEEDS AND OTHER FARM ESSENTIALS ONLY ONE THIRD OF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL QUANTITY OF NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORIC ACID WAS PUT IN THE SOIL AND THERE WAS LESS THAN ONETENTH OF THE USUAL SUPPLY OF CON CENTRATES AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF THE BLOCKADE AS A RESULT OF THE SHORTAGE OF IM PORTS FARM PRODUCTION DECLINED AND COMPELLED THE GERMAN PEOPLE TO SUB MIT TO MOST DRASTIC AND OPPRESSIVE RESTRICTIONS IN FOOD AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN AGRICULTURE AND THE DECREASED AVERAGE YIELD PER ACRE THE TOTAL CROPS SANK TO LESS THAN TWOTHIRDS OF THE NORMAL PREWAR YIELD AND POTATOES TO LESS THAN HALF THE SUGAR BEET WHICH WAS THE BEST INDEX TO OUR INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED SUCH DECREASED ACREAGE AND YIELD THAT THERE IS SCARCELY ENOUGH BEET SUGAR TODAY TO MEET THE MOST URGENT NEEDS OF THE POPULATION WHEREAS BEFORE THE WAR 131THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY GERMANY WAS THE PRINCIPAL EXPORTER OF BEET SUGAR FROM NOVEMBER 1913 TO NOVEMBER 1919 CATTLE DECREASED 123 PER CENT AND PIGS 50 PER CENT AND THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF DRESSED BEEF AS A RESULT OF INSUFFICIENT FEEDS DECREASED 45 PER CENT FOR CATTLE AND 25 PER CENT FOR HOGS BEFORE THE WAR HOMERAISED HOGS CONSTITUTED TWO THIRDS OF THE MEAT SUPPLY OF THE POPULA TION DURING THE LAST YEARS OF THE WAR THE URBAN MEAT SUPPLY WAS LIMITED ALSO ENTIRELY TO CATTLE OF VERY INFERIOR QUALITY AND QUANTITY THE LACK OF CONCENTRATES FURTHERMORE CAUSED A DECREASE OF ALMOST 50 PER CENT IN 1919 IN THE AVERAGE YIELD OF COWS MILK IN THE FIRST PLACE THE END OF THE WAR BROUGHT ABOUT NO CHANGE OF CONDITIONS THE BLOCKADE WAS NOT LIFTED UNTIL A CONSIDERABLE TIME AFTER THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND EVEN NOW THE IMPORTA TION OF FOODSTUFFS AS WELL AS OF FERTILIZERS AND FEEDS IS LIMITED TO THE LOWEST POSSIBLE QUANTITY NECESSARY BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING THEM AND PAR TICULARLY BECAUSE OF GERMANYS FINAN CIAL CONDITION AND THE DEPRECIATED MARK IT WILL REQUIRE YEARS OF INTEN SIVE EFFORT TO RESTORE OUR AGRICULTURE IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE PEACE TREATY HAS DEPRIVED GERMANY OF VERY IMPORTANT TERRITORY PRODUCING SURPLUS FOOD IIBERSCHUSSGEBIETE THE POPULATION OF THE TERRITORY SURRENDERED IS NOT NEARLY SO GREAT AS THE AGRICUL TURAL AREA SURRENDERED FOR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ALSACELORRAINE MOST OF THE COUNTRY SURRENDERED IS AGRICULTURAL APART FROM THE DISTRICTS WHERE SELF DETERMINATION IS PERMITTED GERMANY LOSES 75 PER CENT IN POPULATION AND 149 PER CENT IN FARM LANDS AS A RESULT OF THE SELFDETERMINATION OF NORD SCHLESWIG THIS LOSS IS ALL THE GREATER BUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF TERRITORIAL LOSS IS NOT REALIZED UNTIL ONE CONSIDERS THE RESULTANT LOSS IN FOODSTUFFS WITH THE SURRENDER OF ALMOST ALL OF POSEN AND WEST PRUSSIA TO POLAND GERMANY LOSES ONE OF ITS BEST GRAIN BELTS SINCE THOSE REGIONS PROVIDED MIDDLE GER MANY AND BERLIN ESPECIALLY WITH GRAIN THE PROVINCE OF POSEN PRODUCED ONE TENTH OF ALL THE RYE RAISED IN GERMANY AND THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR POTATOES SUGARBEETS AND BARLEY WHEREAS THE POPULATION OF THE PROVINCE IS ONLY ONETHIRTYFIFTH OF THAT OF THE NATION ITS WHEAT CROP WAS ONETWENTIETH OF THAT OF THE NATION BUT IT MUST BE EMPHASIZED THAT GERMANYS BREAD GRAIN IS RYE AND NOT WHEAT WEST PRUSSIA CONTRIBUTED VERY CONSIDERABLY TO THE FOOD AND FODDER GRAINS AND POTA TOES OF GERMANY ALL TOLD GERMANY LOSES THROUGH THE PEACE TREATY 25 PER CENT OF ITS GRAIN AND POTATO CROPS AND 10 TO 12 PER CENT OF ITS CATTLE RAISED WITH THE GENERAL DECLINE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY GRAINS DECREASED FROM 1913 TO 1919 FROM 307 MILLION TONS TO 151 MILLION TONS POTATOES FROM 50 MILLION TO 20 MILLION TONS RAW SUGAR FROM 27 MILLION TONS TO SEVENTENTHS OF ONE MILLION TONS THE FOOD SHORTAGE RESULTING FROM THE BLOCKADE AND DECREASED DOMESTIC PRODUCTION HAD FRIGHTFUL EFFECTS ON THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHICAL HEALTH OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE AS THE WAR CONTINUED AND THE SHORTAGE BECAME GREATER THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO LIMIT FOOD CONSUMPTION EARLY IN 1916 THE MOST IMPORTANT FOODSTUFFS BREAD MEAT POTATOES MILK BUTTER SUGAR ETC WERE RATIONED FOOD SHORTAGE REACHED ITS LOWEST POINT IN THE ILL FAMED YELLOW TURNIP WINTER OF 191617 WHEN THE POTATO FAILURE OF 1916 COMPELLED THE RAISING OF YELLOW TURNIPS FOR FOOD IN MANY CITIES EITHER NO POTATOES AT ALL OR AT MOST ONLY ONEHALF POUND OF POTATOES PER PERSON PER WEEK COULD BE OBTAINED AN IDEA OF CONDITIONS IN GERMAN CITIES CAN BE GAINED FROM THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF RATIONS AS FIXED BY THE CITY OF 132FOOD CONDITIONS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION BOCHUM AND BOCHUM WAS ONE OF THOSE CITIES WHICH HAD THE LARGEST FOOD SUP PLY THE FOLLOWING TABLE GIVES THE FOOD RATIONS PER PERSON

MILK AND ONE BOX OF SARDINES PACKED IN OIL CERTAIN ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES OF BREAD AND FATS WERE RATIONED TO THOSE WHO DID THE HARDEST AND HEAVIEST WORK BUT THEY WERE OF SUCH SMALL QUANTITY AS TO BE NEGLIGIBLE MILK AND TOAST WERE GIVEN ONLY IN SPECIAL CASES OF DIRE NEED AT TIMES THE MILK SUPPLY OF BOCHUM FELL TO 7000 LITERS PER DAY AS COMPARED TO 42000 LITERS PER DAY BEFORE THE WAR IN ORDER TO REALIZE FULLY WHAT THESE CONDITIONS MEANT WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT WAR RATIONS SHOWED A PREPONDER ANCE OF CARBOHYDRATES OVER ALBUMENS AND FATS AND THAT MUCH OF THE FOOD WAS OF A POOR QUALITY BUT THE SHORTAGE OF ANIMAL FOODS BUTTER LARD MEAT EGGS MILK CHEESE ETC WAS MOST ACUTE AND AVERAG

MEAT WAS SHORT OF FAT BECAUSE THE CATTLE WERE VERY POORLY FED SO THAT THE AVERAGE MEAT RATION OF 135 GRAMS 485 OZONEEIGHTH OF PEACETIME CONSUMPTIONDURING THE LAST MONTHS OF THE WAR COULD IN NO WISE BE COMPARED IN QUALITY OR FOOD VALUE WITH THE MEAT CONSUMED IN PEACE TIMES BREAD WAS OFTEN INFERIOR IN QUALITY BECAUSE WITH THE GRAIN SHORTAGE IT WAS FINALLY NECESSARY TO SO GRIND THE GRAIN THAT THE WHOLE BRAN REMAINED IN 133THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE FLOUR NOT ONLY WAS MUCH OF THE FLOUR OF INFERIOR QUALITY BUT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ADULTERATE IT WITH RAW POTATOES DESICCATED POTATO PRODUCTS BARLEY FLOUR OATMEAL CORNMEAL BEAN FLOUR PEA FLOUR AND FINALLY EVEN TURNIPS THE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT IN MANY DISTRICTS WHERE THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION ALLY ACUTE SHORTAGE OF FLOUR THE BREAD SOMETIMES BECAME ALMOST UNEATABLE ANOTHER SERIOUS FEATURE IN THE FOOD PROBLEM WAS THE EXCESSIVE MONOTONY OF FOOD AND THE INCREASING SALE AND USE OF ADULTERANTS AND DELETERIOUS SUBSTI TUTESAGAINST THIS THE GOVERNMENT WAGED AN OBSTINATE BATTLE SINCE THE RESUMPTION OF IMPORTS CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED MATERIALLY BUT THEY ARE FAR FROM NORMAL IN 1918 PUBLIC RATIONS WERE ONEHALF THE MINI MUM FOR AN ADULT AS TO CALORIES AND ABOUT ONEFIFTH OR SIXTH AS TO FATS AS A RESULT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOODS FLOUR AND FATS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES THERE WAS A TEMPORARY IMPROVEMENT IN THE SUMMER OF 1919 BUT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT RATIONS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE PRESENT YEAR AND THE PERIOD BEFORE THE LIFTING OF THE BLOCKADE IS A GREATER SUPPLY OF FATS SINCE THE LAST YEARS OF THE WAR THE SMUGGLING OF FOODS HAS BECOME VERY COMMON AND PLAYS AN INCREASINGLY LARGE ROLE IN THE FOOD PROBLEM THE PRESSURE RESULTING FROM YEARS OF PRIVATION HAS BECOME SO GREAT THAT THE PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER WILLING TO SUBMIT TO ADMINISTRA TIVE RESTRICTIONS THIS AND RESTORA TION OF IMPORTS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT REASONS WHY THE GOVERNMENT HAS DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS ABOLISHED COMPULSORY FARMING IN MANY DISTRICTS AND REISTABLISHED UNLIMITED TRADE IN THE FUTURE WHEN FOOD IS NO LONGER UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE GOVERN MENT WILL LIMIT ITS ACTIVITIES TO A GENERAL SUPERVISION OF DISTRIBUTION AND PRICES AND WILL MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF GOVERN MENT DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE FOODS WHICH ARE ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL BASES OF SUB SISTENCE PARTICULARLY BREAD MILK AND FOR THE TIME BEING SUGAR IMPORTA TION OF OTHER NECESSARY FOODSTUFFS LIKE FISH EGGS CHEESE VEGETABLES AND FRUIT IS ALSO FREE MOREOVER THE EFFORTS OF THE GOVERNMENT ARE DIRECTED TOWARD IMPORTING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF FOOD STUFFS CHIEFLY GRAIN MEAT AND FATS IN ORDER TO HAVE LARGE SUPPLIES ON HAND AND THUS TO PREVENT ANY FOOD SHORTAGE OR STOPPAGE SUCH AS WAS THE CASE A FEW MONTHS AGO WITH BREAD RATIONS IN ONE OF GERMANYS LARGEST INDUSTRIAL AREAS THE FUTURE OF GERMANY DEPENDS FIRST AND FOREMOST ON THE SOLUTION OF ITS FOOD PROBLEM INSUFFICIENT FOOD FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS HAS SO SAPPED NATIONAL STRENGTH AND VIGOR THAT ITS EFFICIENCY IS MOST MOMENTOUSLY IMPAIRED THE RESULTS ARE MANIFEST NOT ONLY IN UNIVER SAL LOSS OF WEIGHT BUT ALSO AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN LOSS OF HEALTH AND IN CREASED MORTALITY STATISTICS SHOW A MARKED INCREASE IN DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS AND IT WAS IN THIS SPECIAL FIELD THAT GERMAN SCIENCE HAD ATTAINED SUCH REMARKABLE RESULTS BUT THE WAR AND THE BLOCKADE HAVE DE STROYED IT ALL FOR A LONG TIME TO COME AMONG THE DISEASES WHICH CAME IN THE WAKE OF THE WAR IN ESPECIALLY LARGE NUMBERS ARE THOSE OF THE STOMACH AND THE INTESTINES AND THESE ARE THE DIRECT RESULT OF POOR OR BAD FOOD BUT SADDEST OF ALL IS THE PERMANENT INJURY WHICH THE RISING GENERATION IS SUFFERING IN ITS DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH IN PRUSSIA THE MORTALITY OF CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF ONE AND FIVE WAS IN 1914 52924 AND IN 1918 67369 EVEN THOUGH THE BIRTHRATE HAD FALLEN ABOUT 40 PER CENT DURING THE WAR AGAIN IN PRUSSIA THE MORTALITY OF CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIVE AND FIFTEEN ROSE FROM 25730 IN 1914 TO 50391 IN 1918 THE DIRE INCREASE IN MORTALITY IN CHILDREN DURING THE PERIOD WHEN THEY ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND SCHOOL 134FOOD CONDITIONS AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IS DOUBTLESSLY DUE TO LACK OF MILK AND OF ALBUMENOUS AND NITROGENOUS FOOD AMONG ADULTS THE EFFECTS OF UNDER NOURISHMENT ARE MANIFESTED FIRST IN LACK OF EFFICIENCY AND DISINCLINATION TO WORK NOT TO MENTION THE INCREASE IN SICKNESS AND DEATHRATE THESE CONSTI TUTE THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO THE REHA BILITATION OF GERMAN AGRICULTURAL LIFE AND THUS THE ABILITY TO MEET THE RE QUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON GERMANY BY THE PEACE TREATY SECONDLY IN A TEND ENCY TO RADICAL VIEWS AND VENTURES WHICH ARE INTENSIFIED BY UNEMPLOY MENT AND CONSTANTLY THREATEN THE SAFETY OF STATE AND SOCIETY THEREFORE FOR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REASONS WE MUST TAKE VIGOROUS MEASURES AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT TO BRING ABOUT AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THIS GERMANY NEEDS THE MOST FAR REACHING SUPPORT OF THE OTHER NATIONS DOCTOR HERMES THE GERMAN NATIONAL FOOD ADMINISTRATOR REPEATEDLY EM PHASIZED AT THE SPA CONFERENCE AND IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ENGLISH AND ITALIAN FOOD ADMINISTRATORS THAT WITHOUT A MATERIAL INCREASE IN FOOD SUPPLIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IT WILL BE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTORE THE HEALTH AND EFFICIENCY OF GERMAN LABOR UNLESS THE MINERS RECEIVE BETTER AND MORE FOOD IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET THE SPA DEMANDS FOR COAL AND THE MINERS HAVE DECLARED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO INCREASE THE REQUIRED OUTPUT IF THEY ARE GIVEN SUFFICIENT FOOD AT THE PRESENT TIME GERMAN FARMERS SUPPLY THE CITIES WITH AT LEAST THREE FIFTHS OF THE MINIMUM FOOD REQUIRE MENTS THE REMAINDER MUST BE MADE UP PARTLY BY FOOD IMPORTS FOR IMME DIATE HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND PARTLY BY IMPORTING THOSE THINGS WHICH WILL ENABLE PLANT AND ANIMAL PRODUCTION TO BE INCREASED THE TOTAL VALUE OF THESE MINIMUM IMPORTS NECESSARY TO RESTORE THE GERMAN FOOD SUPPLY TO A NORMAL CONDITION AMOUNTS TO MORE THAN THREE AND ONEHALF MILLION GOLD MARKS THE PAYMENT OF THIS SUM WILL NOT BE POSSI BLE WITHOUT EXTENSIVE CREDITS NATURALLY THESE IMPORTS ARE ONLY A MAKESHIFT IN VIEW OF THE INDEM NITIES IMPOSED BY THE PEACE TREATY THE GERMAN PEOPLE MUST STRIVE TO DE RIVE THEIR FOOD SUPPLY FROM DOMESTIC SOURCES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE PRE SUMPTION IS IN OUR FAVOR IN THIS RESPECT BECAUSE GERMAN AGRICULTURE WAS IN SUCH A BRILLIANT STATE OF DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THE WAR AND SURPASSED THE CROPS OF MOST OTHER COUNTRIES IN SPITE OF A LESS FAVORABLE CLIMATE THIS SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS STILL ALIVE IN THE GERMAN FARMER ALTHOUGH IT IS OBSTRUCTED BY THE GREAT DIFFICULTIES IN FARMING WHICH CONTINUE UNABATED AS THE EFFECTS OF THE WAR AND THE CONDITIONS RESULTING THERE FROM THE AGRICULTURAL AREAS HAVE BEEN IMPOVERISHED BY THE WARYEARS OF SOILROBBING BUILDINGS AND STOCK ARE WORN OUT THE REISTABLISHMENT OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY REQUIRES ENOR MOUS MEANS ESPECIALLY SO BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY RISE IN PRICES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1919 WHICH IS PARTLY DUE TO THE DEPRECIATION OF THE MARK AND SO A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF FARMERS HESITATE TO SPEND LARGE SUMS OF MONEY FOR COMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS BECAUSE EITHER THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THEM OR IT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE A POOR INVESTMENT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE LOW PRICES WHICH THEY RECEIVE FOR THEIR PRODUCTS BUT THE IMPERATIVELY NECESSARY DROP IN PRICES FOR FARM STOCK DEPENDS ESSEN TIALLY ON A DECREASE IN THE COST OF INDUS TRIAL PRODUCTION AND THIS LATTER IS AGAIN INFLUENCED BY THE COST OF FOOD GER MANY IS THUS IN A FATAL CIRCLE LACK OF FOOD CAUSES INSUFFICIENT PRODUCTION AND PERMANENT INCREASE IN WAGES THE RESULT OF WHICH IS FEW AND DEAR PRODUCTS FROM THE FACTORY AND HIGH PRICES OF MANUFACTURES RETARD AGRICUL 135THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TURAL PRODUCTION SO THAT PRICES KEEP ON RISING CONSTANTLY UNLESS THIS CIRCLE IS BROKEN SOMEWHERE AND THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED ONLY WITH THE AID OF FOOD FROM THE OTHER NATIONS AN ESPECIALLY GREAT OBSTACLE TO AGRI CULTURAL PRODUCTION IS THE DIRE LACK OF FERTILIZERS CONTAINING PHOSPHORIC ACID IN THE FERTILIZER YEAR 191920 GERMAN FARMERS OBTAINED ONLY 139000 TONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACIDONLY ONEFIFTH OF THE PREWAR PERIOD ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THROUGH THE LOSS OF THE MINES IN LUXEM BURG LORRAINE AND THE SAAR VALLEY THE AVAILABLE THOMAS SLAG DECREASED AT LEAST 600000 TONS AND ON THE BASIS OF PEACETIMES PRODUCTION ABOUT 12 MILLION TONS GERMAN FARMS WILL NEED AT LEAST 500000 TONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID ANNUALLY UNDER THE BEST POS SIBLE CONDITIONS OF PRODUCTION AND IMPORTATION OF THOMAS SLAG AT LEAST 235000 TONS MUST BE OBTAINED BY THE IMPORTATION OF AT LEAST 500000 TONS OF RAW PHOSPHATE ROHPHOSPHATE IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THE SHORTAGE OF PHOSPHORIC ACID IT IS TO THE MUTUAL ADVANTAGE OF BOTH GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES THAT GERMANY SHOULD EXCHANGE POTASH FOR PHOSPHATE THE ENORMOUS NITROGENPRODUCING PLANTS CONSTRUCTED DURING THE WAR WILL IN THE FUTURE ENABLE GERMANY TO MEET ITS DEMANDS FOR NITROGENCONTAINING FERTILIZERS PROVIDED THAT THE COAL NECES SARY FOR NITROGEN PRODUCTION CAN BE OBTAINED THE YEAR 191920 SHOWS A MARKED INCREASE IN NITROGEN PRODUC TION OVER 191319 BUT IT IS NOT SUFFI CIENT TO MAKE UP FOR THE SHORTAGE DURING THE WAR GERMANY WILL LIKEWISE BE ABLE TO BUY ITS CONCENTRATES FROM THE UNITED STATES AND SO INCREASE ITS PRODUCTION OF MEATS FATS AND MILK THE GERMAN PEOPLE FEEL WITH DEEP GRATITUDE THE EVIDENCES OF GENEROSITY WHICH ARE EXPRESSED IN THE GREAT AID BY THE AMERICAN RELIEF SOCIETIES TO STARVING GERMAN CHILDREN THROUGH THEIR NOBLEMINDED ACTS THE DIRE NEED OF THE POOREST AND MOST INNOCENT VICTIMS OF THE MISERY CAUSED BY THE WAR WILL AT LEAST BE AMELIORATED 136

j100358,The School Review,1075537,Open School Organizations,i244571,THE SCHOOL REVIEW For a closing sentiment let me suggest the following No castes no secret societies no privileged classes in the schools but the schools and every feature of them of the people for the people and by the people As a part of the report relating to the influence of these organizations in secondary schools from the different viewpoints of the member of the fraternity or sorority the parent and some of the leading educators other than highschool or academy principals is in the form of letters it is not deemed practical to reproduce this part of the report here This matter will be included in a later report of the committee At the close of this report President Harper asked whether he com mittee had any recommendations to make The chairman stated hat the committee would like to present its report as a report of progress and to be continued with a view to report further at the next session It was accordingly moved that the committee be continued After further discussion of the question involved in the report it was voted that in view of the evidence submitted in the opinion of those in attendance at this meeting the presence of secret societies in schools of secondary grade is harmful to the best interests of these schools and of the individuals concerned It was then voted to defer the discussion of the third topic announced on the program namely cooperation of school with town for civic improvement and that a committee be named by the chair to report upon that topic at the executive session of Deans and Prin cipals for the Nineteenth Educational Conference OPEN SCHOOL ORGANIZATIONS PRINCIPAL PAUL G W KELTTER Manitowoc Wis ABBREVIATED The problem of school organizations is one that touches in its first and last analysis a fundamental principle in our civic life of which the school itself with its organizations is an important part at least the school is a great factor in the molding of those activities which later will be a part of the civic life It is not the purpose of this paper to point out the elements in secret organizations which are undemocratic and so inconsistent with the ideal of an American school system nor to discuss the legality of the control of such organizations by school authorities I will IOEIGHTEEN TII EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE only touch upon the question of how open organizations can be made to take the place of secret organizations If we could grant that secret organizations are the outgrowth of a desire on the part of the student body to supply a social want or any other not supplied by the regular school activities then it seems to me it would be comparatively easy to show how open activities can be made to supplant the secret organizations directly The very fact however that such organiza tions are designated as secret which really means that they are clannish and select shows that their origin does not lie in a whole some social motive The cause of this undesirable motive is to be sought outside of the school namely in the home and social sur roundings Thus it is clear that open organizations could not be directly substituted for secret organizations since the motives are diametrically opposed to each other The only aid we can expect then of open organizations in solving this problem is to have the open activities so vigorous and so democratic and aggressive in spirit that the other organizations cannot flourish That there is a desire on the part of highschool students to do something outside of the regular classroom work I am certain and it is the duty of the school to supply this want in a measure Where such opportunities are offered to students there is very little danger of there being social cliques an excess of student parties with the attending unwholesome results dancing parties and other outside ofschool affairs in which students take part for want of something better to do It is clear to me that we must reach outside of the school to get the grip on our boys and girls which we must have to get lasting results not as to mindtraining so much but as to heart training The natural way to begin is to take such interests as the students show and develop them thus building up activities which take up about all their leisure time Of course it is clear that such activities are not always under the direct supervision of a member of the faculty but when not the students interests and hearts are with the work and whatever time the student may have at his disposal is taken up in preparation for the next meeting As I look back upon the develop ment of the work I am certain that success depends upon the fact that this work must be the outgrowth of an interest on the part of IITHE SCHOOL REVIEW the students To illustrate this let me state how one or two of our most recent organizations came into being I For two years past we have been doing systematic work in rhetoricals Each student took part in this work and the drilling was put into the hands of all the members of the faculty in turn This year there was a vacancy in the department of English and in securing the teacher to fill this place care was taken to secure a teacher capable of handling this work Through the two years of practice and the inspiration this teacher gave twentyfive students became intensely interested in the work in expression and reading They met and arranged to talk the matter over with us The result is an Expressive Reading Club which meets once a week in the evening with the teacher of English Their cooperative spirit showed itself at the first meeting they wished to do something at once which they might present to the school for the Thanksgiving or Christmas programs at which time friends and parents visit the school 2 Our orchestra was organized in a similar way It kept up practice during the summer vacation and had several surprises in store for us when school opened in the way of new selections Through the orchestra in particular have we learned what the effect of these organizations is on the life outside of the school In some cases it has changed the whole plan of the family circle during those times when all the members are gathered especially in the evening Concerning the music where before there was halfhearted practice as a simple matter of course there is now earnest devotion to the work since there is a purpose in it all and through all this the effort to keep these boys and girls at home is lessened The boys and girls glee clubs sprang up in the same way though not all at the same time The girls had been enjoying their work for over a semester when the boys became interested Now each organization meets once a week with the director and they themselves spend even ings enjoying the preparation of selections for the next meeting 3 Those students interested in business activities are associated with the management of the highschool paper At present they are planning to lay aside the margin made each month to purchase a small printing outfit with which to do their own and most of the schools printing This in turn will offer an opportunity for a prac 12EIGHTEENTH ED UCATIONAL CONFERENCE tical kind of manual work for those boys interested in the work of the printer The students who have charge of the literary and edi torial departments are constantly on the lookout for ways and means of aiding any and all the other activities of the school 4 The members of the Associated Press committee review the material on the readingtables and post pictures clippings and notes on interesting material on a bulletin board for this purpose They keep the school posted through this and occasional talks on all the important topics of the day Then they give valuable assist ance to students preparing work for the literary society The society meets every other week in the evening and the work is under the guidance of two members of the faculty The details of the work are carried on by regularly elected officers and members of the asso ciation 5 The work of the athletic organizations is very much the same as in other schools 6 The last two years the school has also conducted a course of lectures and entertainments the management of which is largely in the hands of the students under faculty supervision In mentioning these different lines of work I know I am enumer ating activities which are more or less common to all progressive high schools Our aim is to blend all these activities so that the spirit of cooperation and mutual helpfulness shall be the leading motive in all Each organization does its own work with results characteristic of that organization yet we try wherever possible to show the leaders at least that the work has failed of its higher mission if it does not contribute something to the life of the school as a unit We aim to teach the lesson of cooperation in a practical way in order that every student may carry away with him a prac tical ideal of civic cooperation which will bear fruit in the profes sions or in business or in the shop We want him to realize that even work done as well as it can be done is not an end in itself it must be properly related to the circle of activities in which it is done In other words we aim to teach the lesson of unselfishness and that cooperation pays We have had and have still social organizations of small groups of students These are usually formed along the lines of genuine I3THE SCHOOL REVIEW common interest such as the love of music similar work at school athletics art etc If a student has the time and cares to associate himself with any of them he is perfectly free to do so The ideal of one of these organizations is quite clearly set forth in a part of a letter written by a member of the F F club who is now in Cali fornia in answer to my question asking what benefits she derived from the club You may remember that I got special mention the first time I took the fiveweeks test Well the sophomore girls club F F which means Friend ship and Fun saw it and very shortly afterward I was asked to join the club and I never can be glad enough It seems a little thing but I came in contact with bright lively and still industrious girls who spent one evening a week Friday or Saturday in fun which helped through the coming week of study and application to the work in hand We used to have such good times and they will always be part of my delightful memories of school life I believe that every student ought to if he can do something of this kind for if the brain alone is cultivated at the expense of the body it starts the owner into the world top heavy Associating with other students brushing up against every variety of temperament and disposition mingling in all the activities outside the class these are the things that strike the happy balance and round out the man Noth ing is more delightful than these little informal societies for it is here where we learn our first lessons in life and contact with others beside the home circle when we are old enough to decide for ourselves what kind of friends we wish to have It must be confessed that the handling of this problem of outside or open school activities is not an easy task However it is worth all the time we give to it and I believe we could well afford to lose a little on the side of intellectual training if through that we can get a grip on the activities of the boys and girls outside of school especially those which make for hearttraining an earnest wholesome civic pride and the broad spirit of cooperation The main topic considered by the General Session of the Conference assembled in Mandel Hall on Saturday morning November II was The Extension of the High School to Include the First Two Years of College Work This topic had likewise been before the Conference of November 1902 and that of I903 A r6sume of the discussions at the session of I903 was presented by Principal John C Hanna of Oak Park These papers were printed in full in the issue of this magazine for January I903 Fol lowing Mr Hanna Superintendent J Stanley Brown

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075374,EDITORIAL NOTES,I244580,EDITORIAL NOTES GEORGE HERBERT LOCKE THIS JOURNAL WAS FOUNDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN AMERICA BY BEING A SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND INSPIRATION AND A MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATION AMONG THOSE ENGAGED IN THAT THE VALEDICTORY WORK IT HAS HAD BUT TWO EDITORS THE FOUNDER AND THROUGH OF THE EDITOR SEVEN YEARS THE EDITOR DR CHARLES H THURBER WHO IN MARCH 900OO PASSED OVER THE CARES RESPONSIBILITIES AND PLEASURES OF EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL ISM TO THE ONE WHOSE NAME HAS SINCE THAT TIME APPEARED AT THE HEAD OF THIS DEPART MENT DR THURBERS NAME DID NOT AT ONCE DISAPPEAR FROM THE TITLEPAGE PERHAPS FOR THE SAME REASON THAT ACTUATES MANY MERCANTILE HOUSES TO PERPETUATE THE NAME THAT HAS MADE THE BUSINESS A GREAT SUCCESS EVEN AFTER THE OWNERS REPRESENTED BY THAT NAME HAVE LONG SINCE RETIRED SUCH AT ANY RATE WAS THE FEELING OF HIS SUCCESSOR WHO FOUND THIS JOURNAL PREEMINENTLY A GOING CONCERN THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN IDEALS IN THE CHANGE OF EDITORS FOR WE HAVE ENDEAVORED TO CARRY OUT THE POLICY WHICH UNDER DR THURBER HAD WON THE CONFIDENCE OF SO MANY PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE WORK OF SECONDARY EDUCATION THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A NATIONAL JOURNAL IN THAT IT REFLECTED THE VIEWS OF NO PARTICULAR SCHOOL OF EDUCATIONAL THEORY OR PRACTICE BUT WAS READY AT ALL TIMES TO PUBLISH THE VIEWS OF ANY PERSON WHO HAD ANYTHING OF IMPORTANCE TO COMMUNICATE TO THOSE WHO WERE WORKING FOR THE INTERESTS OF GIRLS AND BOYS OF THE HIGHSCHOOL AND COLLEGE AGE TO THAT EXTENT IT HAS BEEN A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR EDUCATIONAL OPINION AND EXPERIENCE AND IT IS A PLEASURE TO POINT OUT THAT ITS INTELLECTUAL AND MATERIAL RECEIPTS HAVE KEPT PACE WITH THE GROWING PROSPERITY OF THE NATION AT LARGE THIS IS THE GREATEST PROFITSHARING ENTERPRISE OF THE DECADE IN THAT THE SUBSCRIBERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING A CONSTANTLY INCREASING DIVIDEND UNTIL AT THE PRESENT TIME EIGHT HUNDRED PAGES PER ANNUM ARE GIVEN FOR SUCH A MODEST SUM THAT WE REFRAIN FROM MENTIONING IT AT A MEETING OF THE HARVARD TEACHERS ASSOCIATION SOME TWO YEARS AGO THE SUBJECT FOR DISCUSSION AT THE ANNUAL DINNER WAS THE COMPENSATION OF THE TEACHER AND IT WAS CLEARLY POINTED OUT THAT THIS LAY NOT IN SILVER AND GOLD BUT IN THE OPPORTUNITY OF HELPING OTHERS THIS APPLIES WITH LIKE FORCE TO HIGHER EDUCATIONAL JOURNALISM AND DESPITE ITS MATERIAL DRAWBACKS THERE IS A CERTAIN SATISFACTION IN THAT OPPORTUNITY OF HELPFULNESS AGAIN THE EDITOR HAS AN OPPOR TUNITY NOT ONLY TO HELP OTHERS BUT TO GROW IN GRACE HIMSELF BY ACQUIRING ALL THE GRACES OF PATIENCE LONG SUFFERING MEEKNESS BROTHERLY KINDNESS AND CHARITY 828EDITORIAL NOTES 829 THESE HE HAS NOT TO SEEK BUT LIKE THE GREATNESS ACQUIRED BY SO MANY MEN IN THIS MATERIAL AGE THEY ARE THRUST UPON HIM THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE SCHOOL REVIEW REPRESENT THE WORKERS IN THE FIELD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION AND HAD WE THE INTEREST OF THE STATISTICIAN WE COULD SHOW WHAT A GOODLY COMPANY THEY ARE TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO DURING THESE YEARS HAVE RESPONDED SO HEARTILY TO THE REQUESTS OF THE EDITOR IN HIS MANY HOURS OF NEED AND TO THOSE WHO HAVE SAID AND WRITTEN ENCOURAGING WORDS THE EDITOR BIDS FAREWELL WITH MANY REGRETS IN THIS DAY OF ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN OUR SECONDARY SCHOOLS WE FEEL IT WILL BE OF DECIDED BENEFIT TO THE TEACHERS AS WELL AS TO THE STUDENTS TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT MR HENRY JAMES DID SAY IN MR HENRY JAMES THE FAMOUS SPEECH MADE AT BRYN MAWRTHE CAUSE OF SO MUCH ON ENGLISH AS SPOKEN BY THE COMMENT IN THE NEWSPAPERS MR JAMES HAS A RIGHT TO SPEAK AMERICANS ON THIS SUBJECT FOR HE IS A MASTER OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THOUGH FORTUNATELY THERE MAY BE MANY MASTERS AND ONE MAY CHOOSE HIS SPEECH WAS DIVIDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CRITICISM INTO SEVENTEEN PARTS BY AN INDUSTRIOUS AND INTERESTED HEARER THEY ARE I SPEECH IS VERY IMPORTANT 2 AMERICANS DONT SPEAK SO WELL AS THEY THINK THEY DO 3 THEY HAVE NO VOCAL TONE SUCH AS THE ENGLISH FRENCH GERMANS AND ITALIANS HAVE 4 THE SPEECH OF THE YOUNG IS NEGLECTED BY THEIR ELDERS 5 FLATNESS CRUDITY NEGLIGENCE CHARACTERIZE OUR SPEECH 6 THE CONSONANTS ARE NOT WELL ARTICULATED ARE EVEN DROPPED OUT AS IN YEEH FOR YES 7 THE LETTER R IS TRILLED 8 OR ADDED WHERE IT DOES NOT BELONG AS IN IDEAR POPPER 9 THE LETTER S IS SIMILARLY ADDED AS IN NOWHERESELSE A GOOD WAYS OFF IO SOME VOWELS ARE DRAWLED FLATLY AS IN GAWD DAWG SAWFT LAWFT GAWN LAWST FRAWST II IN FIFTY YEARS IF WE TRY HARD WE MAY SHINE PHONETICALLY 12 NO LANGUAGE WAS EVER SO ABUSED AS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAS BEEN ABUSED IN AMERICA BECAUSE OTHER LANGUAGES HAVE STAYED IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE 13 THE COMMON SCHOOLS HELP TO VULGARIZE THE LANGUAGE 14 THE NEWSPAPERS WITH THEIR MANIACAL HEADLINES ARE WORSE I15 WORST OF ALL ARE THE IMMIGRANTS WHO TREAT OUR LANGUAGE LIKE A CHEAP TENEMENT 16 BUT WORSE THAN THE WORST IS THE SLACKNESS OF NATIVE AMERICANS THEIR DISREGARD FOR AUTHORITY THEIR LACK OF SENSITIVENESS TO VOCAL ATROCITIES 17 IT IS BETTER TO BE CONSCIOUS AND IMITATIVE IN SPEECH THAN NOT TO ATTEMPT IMPROVEMENT830 THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE COMMITTEE ON SALARIES TENURE AND PENSIONS OF TEACHERS APPOINTED BY THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND

PROVED TO BE OF SPECIAL INTEREST INASMUCH AS REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS SOMENEXPERIENCES COLLEGES WERE CALLED UPON TO REPORT ON THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH WITH THE COLLEGE THE BOARD MISS PENDLETON OF WELLESLEY COLLEGE SAID ENTRANCE I KNOW THAT THE HISTORY OF THE BOARD HAS BEEN THAT ON JOINING EXAMINATION BOARM THE BOARD WITHOUT GIVING UP ITS OWN EXAMINATIONS AN INSTITUTION HAS AFTER A YEAR OR PERHAPS MORE HAVING SEEN THE WORKINGS OF THE BOARD GIVEN UP ITS OWN EXAMINATIONS THAT WAS THE CASE IN THE COLLEGE WHICH I REPRESENT WELLESLEY COLLEGE JOINED THE BOARD I THINK AFTER ITS FIRST YEAR ACCEPTING THE INVITATION WHICH WAS FIRST GIVEN TO NEW ENGLAND COLLEGES WE KEPT OUR OWN EXAMINATIONS FOR THAT FIRST YEAR AND HAVE SINCE GIVEN THEM UP ENTIRELY OTHER COLLEGES I KNOW HAVE DONE THE SAME BUT IT IS TRUE AS PROFESSOR HALL HAS SAID THAT THERE ARE COLLEGES THAT BELONG TO THE BOARD THAT DO STILL RETAIN THEIR OWN EXAMINATIONS IN SOME CASES HOWEVER I THINK IT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THE EXAMINATIONS OF THE BOARD ARE TOO DIFFICULT BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE ON ACCOUNT OF A PECULIARITY IN ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS THE EXAMINATIONS SET BY THE BOARD FAIL TO FIT THEIR OWN PARTICULAR ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS AND FOR THE CON VENIENCE OF THE STUDENTS THEY OFFER THEIR OWN EXAMINATIONS AT LEAST THAT IS THE REASON GIVEN AND I KNOW IN SOME CASES THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY SOEDITORIAL NOTES 833 MISS JORDAN AS A MEMBER OF THE EXAMINING BOARD OF SMITH COLLEGE I MAY SUPPLEMENT WHAT MISS PENDLETON HAS SAID WE HOLD EXAMINATIONS IN JUNE AND SEPTEMBER IN NORTHAMPTON AND IN OTHER PLACES WHEN STUDENTS APPLYING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PASS A LOCAL EXAMINATION WRITE TO LEARN WHETHER THE COLLEGE AUTHORITIES PREFER THAT THEY SHOULD GO TO ONE OF THE LOCAL EXAMINATIONS HELD BY THE EXAMINING BOARD OR GO TO NORTHAMPTON IT HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM OF THE REGISTRAR TO REPLY THAT IF IT WERE EQUALLY CONVENIENT TO THE CANDIDATES THE COLLEGE WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THEM COME TO NORTHAMPTON THE INCREASING CONFIDENCE FELT BY OUR EXAMINING BOARD IN THE WORK OF THE CENTRAL EXAMINATIONS MAKES IT LIKELY THAT WE SHALL SUBSTITUTE THESE LOCAL EXAMINATIONS FOR OURS AND AS A FIRST STEP SHALL GIVE UP OUR JUNE LOCAL EXAMINATIONS OUTSIDE OF NORTHAMPTON THERE HAS BEEN A STRONG PREJUDICE ON THE PART OF INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS IT HAS BEEN VOICED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THIS BODYAGAINST GIVING UP WHAT THEY CALL THE PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THEIR CANDIDATES THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID IN FAVOR OF THE AGREEABLE ADVERTISING CHARACTER OF A VISIT TO THE SEAT OF LEARNING STUDENTS WHO COME FOR EXAMINATIONS AND FAIL PERHAPS IN THEIR EXAMINATIONS BECOME SO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE FORM OF MISFORTUNE TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED THAT THEY WISH TO COME AGAIN AND TO TRY AGAIN IN SMITH COLLEGE WE FEEL THAT THE BOARD DOES OUR WORK WELL WE HAVE HOWEVER BEEN INFORMED THAT IT CONSIDERS 6O PER CENT A GOOD PASS THAT BEING THE FACT A STUDENT WHO DOES NOT GET 6O PER CENT IS IMMEDIATELY UNDER SUSPICION AND USUALLY HAS TO TAKE EITHER A SECOND EXAMINATION BY THE BOARD OR SUPPLEMENT THE UNSATISFACTORY EXAMINATION BY EXAMINATION IN NORTHAMPTON OR IN SOME OTHER PLACE WHERE OUR EXAMINATIONS ARE HELD PRESIDENT WOOLLEY OF MOUNT HOLYOKE THE COLLEGEENTRANCE EXAMINA TION BOARD HAS NOT REACHED A STATE OF PERFECTION I THINK AS YET BUT IT IS VERY EARNESTLY TRYING TO PREPARE A SET OF PAPERS WHICH SHALL NOT BE ERRATIC WHICH SHALL REALLY REPRESENT NOT THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF ANY ONE INSTITUTION BUT THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OF OPINION IN THE SUBJECT WHICH IS UNDER EXAMINATION THE FACT THAT EXAMINATIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS SATISFACTORY COMES VERY QUICKLY TO THE EARS OF THE BOARD CERTAINLY TO THE EARS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE EVEN IF IT DOES NOT ALWAYS SEEM NECESSARY TO PRESENT THE ENTIRE MATTER TO THE BOARD AND ANY SUBJECT SUCH AS ENGLISH OR LATIN WHICH HAS NOT BEEN SATISFACTORY IS AT ONCE REFERRED BACK TO THE BOARD OF EXAMINERS FOR CORRECTION ANOTHER YEAR AS THE EXAMINERS REPRE SENT SO MANY INSTITUTIONS AND THE READERS REPRESENT SO MANY MORE IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT IN THE COURSE OF TIME THESE EXAMINATIONS REALLY WILL BE REPRESENTATIVE IF THEY ARE NOT SO TODAY OUR OWN EXPERIENCE HAVING SENT STUDENTS TO THE BOARD OF EXAMINERS FOR THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS FOR OUR JUNE EXAMINATIONS HAS BEEN A VERY SATISFACTORY ONE IT IS TRUE THAT IN A CERTAIN SENSE THE BOARD DOES ESTABLISH THE STANDARD THAT IS ITS READERS MARK ON A CERTAIN SCALE BUT EACH COLLEGE IS LEFT ENTIRELY FREE TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THESE RECORDS AS THEY COME INTO ITS REGISTRARS OFFICE IF THE COLLEGES ARE ERRATIC IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT SHOULD BE CRITICISED AND NOT THE BOARD THE BOARD REALLY HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO834 THE SCHOOL REVIEW WITH THE RECORDS AFTER THEY ARE ONCE SENT IN TO THE COLLEGES I THINK THAT THE COLLEGE SHOULD BE AS CAREFUL TO BE PERFECTLY FAIR IN THE ACCEPTANCE OF THESE RECORDS AS IT WOULD BE IN THE ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE WHICH COME FROM ITS OWN EXAMINATIONS IT HAS BEEN OUR FEELINGI SAY OUR AS REPRESENTING OF COURSE ONLY MY OWN COLLEGETHAT THE PREPARATORY SCHOOLS WOULD PREFER SOMETHING WHICH TENDS TO UNIFORMITY SO THAT THE SAME SCHOOL WOULD NOT BE OBLIGED TO MEET THE REQUIRE MENTS OF HALF A DOZEN INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS OFTEN A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO DR GALLAGHER THE DIFFICULTY WAS MET THERE THAT WAS MET WITH IN NEW ENGLAND AND I SUPPOSE WILL BE MET WITH EVERYWHERE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANY STANDARD ON WHICH ALL WOULD AGREE I MEAN TO HAVE A SET OF EXAMINATIONS AND THEN HAVE THE PERCENTAGE AT WHICH THEY ARE RATED AGREED UPON BY ALL THE INSTITUTIONS CONCERNED THAT HAS BEEN THE DIFFICULTY IN TRYING TO FORM BOARDS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN COLLEGES THIS BOARD DOES NOT PRETEND TO CERTIFY TO ANY COLLEGE IT SIMPLY HOLDS EXAMINATIONS AND GIVES RATINGS OF PERCENTAGES THEN EACH INSTITUTION IS LEFT FREE TO DETERMINE AT WHAT RATE IT WILL ACCEPT THE PERCENTAGES THAT ARE ASSIGNED BY THE BOARD SO THAT IT LEAVES IT PERFECTLY FEASIBLE FOR A IF IT CHOOSE TO TAKE STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN EXAMINED BY THIS BOARD TO SAY THAT IN A CERTAIN SUBJECT THEY MUST ATTAIN 90 PER CENT AS RATED BY THE BOARD IT WOULD ENABLE B IF IT CHOSE TO DO SO TO SAY WE WILL TAKE 40 PER CENT SO THAT THE QUESTION WHETHER THE EXAMINATIONS ARE TOO HARD OR TOO EASY WOULD NOT APPEAR IN A TABLECOULD NOT BE PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORM MAY I SAY THAT OF THE THIRTY NINE GENTLEMEN AND LADIES WHO MAKE OUT THE PAPERS THIS YEAR THIRTEEN COME FROM OUR NEW ENGLAND COLLEGES  I THINK THAT PRESIDENT HALL HAS JUST HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD IN REGARD TO THIS MATTER EVERY LARGE THING IN THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT MUST HAVE ITS ACTIONS AND REACTIONS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AT ANY ONE TIME TO SAY IT IS PERFECT WE CAN ONLY APPROXI MATE THAT INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES PRO OR CON ARE NOT TO BE WEIGHED TOO HEAVILY ANY MAN WHO HAS TAUGHT SCHOOL FOR FIVE YEARS CAN BRING UP INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES ON BOTH SIDES OF ANY QUESTION IT IS ALWAYS TO BE REMEMBERED THAT DEQUINCEY HAD A LONG LIST OF PREDECESSORS IN MAKING JUDAS ISCARIOT THE TYPICAL APOSTLE THE BEST ONE OF THE TWELVE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION THERE WILL ALWAYS BE INDIVIDUAL EXCEPTIONS TO EVERY MATTER THAT IS PRESENTED

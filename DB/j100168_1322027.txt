its tax receivable coupons as to impair its contract obligation within Article I Section IO of the Constitution The Act also provided that the State officers should at once bring suit against those tendering couponls without the requisite proof as delinquents field that under the eleventh amendment the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to enjoin the officers from bringing such suit Osborn v Bank 9 Wheat 738 see supra p 223 in which State officers were enjoined from seizing property for taxes in pursuance of a levy under an uncon stitutional State law and Poindexter v Greenhow II4 US 270 in

individuals the State was not a party at all As individuals they must make out their defence under the law of the United States and the State statute being unconstitutional would not be regarded In the present case the only party bringing the suit against which an injunction is asked is the State though of necessity represented by its officers Harlan J dissented holding that the cases were not

intoxicating liquors and although it results in greatly diminishing the value of property engaged in the busi ness it is not depriving  any person of life liberty or property without due process of

might be used for other purposes without com pensation to owners He thus objects particularly to the clause which gives power to shut up and abate such place by taking possession thereof and destroving all intoxicating liquors found therein together with all signs screens bars bottles glasses and otlher property used in keeping and maintaining said nuisance Mugler v State 36 Alb LJ 525 US

Court go upon the ground that one who makes a representation as to the estate of the proposed husband forming an inducement to the marriage is bound to make it good in the manner represented The plaintiff being the issue is considered to have all the rights of her mother especially since if the representation had been true all the property would have gone to the plaintiff Upon legal principles the result reached by the Court seems somewhat extraordinary No authority is cited that in the least sustains the proposition that Ds misrepresentation about his pro perty to the mother made him a constructive trustee for the mother and so for her heir Her remedy was at law for deceit It may be possible to conceive that Ds fraud was an equitable tort toward the unborn issue but the

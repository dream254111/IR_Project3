J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011742,PUBLIC EVENING SCHOOLS OF TRADES,I242595,PUBLIC EVENING SCHOOLS OF TRADES BY CHARLES F WARNER PRINCIPAL OF THE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL SPRINGFIELD MASS IN OCTOBER I898 THE CITY OF SPRINGFIELD MASSACHUSETTS OPENED THE MACHINE SHOP OF ITS NEWLY ESTABLISHED MECHANIC ARTS HIGH SCHOOL FOR EVENING CLASSES IN MACHINE TOOL WORK THE CITY ALSO AS SUMED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CONTINUING THE PLUMBING CLASSES OF A PRI VATE TRADES SCHOOL WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED ON FOR TWO YEARS WITHOUT MAKING MUCH PROGRESS AND WAS THEREFORE READY TO PUT ITS BUILDING AND SUCH OF ITS EQUIPMENT AS MIGHT BE USED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL AUTHORITIES THESE CLASSES IN MACHINE TOOL WORK AND PLUMBING FORMED THE BEGINNINGS OF THE SPRINGFIELD EVENING SCHOOL OF TRADESTHE FIRST TRADES SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES TO BE SUP PORTED AT PUBLIC EXPENSE THE FIRST CLASSES ORGANIZED UNDER THIS NEW DEPARTURE WERE NECES SARILY CONDUCTED ON A SOMEWHAT EXPERIMENTAL PLAN BUT THEY IMME DIATELY BECAME POPULAR WITH THE LOCAL MECHANICS AND THE FIRST SEASON PROVED TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL NOT ONLY WAS THE INSTRUCTION PROMPTLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE OF GREAT VALUE TO THE MEN WHO RECEIVED IT BUT IT WAS NO LESS PROMPTLY SEEN TO BE OF GENERAL PROFIT TO THE TRADES REPRESENTED BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE FIRST YEAR THE MASTER PLUMB ERS ASSOCIATION VOLUNTARILY AGREED IN EMPLOYING HELP TO GIVE THE PREFERENCE TO MEMBERS OF THE EVENING CLASSES IN PLUMBING LEADING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE IRONWORKING TRADES EXPRESSED APPROVAL AND ADVISED THEIR EMPLOYEES TO JOIN THE MACHINE SHOP CLASSES THIS EARLY SUCCESS ENCOURAGED THE AUTHORITIES TO EXPAND THE WORK OF THE SCHOOL CLASSES IN PATTERNMAKING AND OTHER KINDS OF WOODWORK WERE ADDED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND SESSION AND THE ENROLMENT IN THESE CLASSES THOUGH LESS THAN THAT IN THE MACHINESHOP WORK HAS STEADILY INCREASED A CLASS IN MATHEMATICS FOR MECHANICS WAS ORGANIZED AT THE OPENING OF SCHOOL IN OCTOBER I901 AND IT PROVED TO BE A VALUABLE ADDITION THE ENROLMENT IN THIS WORK DURING THE YEARS FOLLOWING IS EVIDENCE OF THE GROWING APPRECIATION OF THE VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUCTION THERE ARE NOW TWO CLASSESAN ELEMENTARY AND 56PUBLIC EVENING SCHOOLS OF TRADES AN ADVANCED CLASS WHICH TOGETHER COVER A WIDE RANGE OF MATHE MATICAL SUBJECTS A LECTURE COURSE IN ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM WAS ALSO STARTED IN I9OI AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR THIS WORK WAS EXTENDED BY THE ADDITION OF TWO LABORATORY CLASSES IN APPLIED ELEC TRICITY EACH MEETING TWICE A WEEK THESE CLASSES HAVE MET THE POPULAR INTEREST IN ELECTRICAL SUBJECTS AND THE WORK ALREADY ACCOM PLISHED JUSTIFIES THEIR CONTINUANCE IN THIS SAME YEAR I9OI THE EVENING MECHANICAL DRAWING CLASSES WHICH UNDER THE MASSACHUSETTS STATUTE OF I870 HAD ALREADY BEEN IN OPERATION THIRTY YEARS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE EVENING SCHOOL OF TRADES IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE WORK OF THIS SCHOOL NOW INCLUDED THOROUGH INSTRUCTION IN ME CHANICAL DRAWING MACHINESHOP PRACTICE AND TOOLMAKING PLUMBING JOINERY CABINETMAKING WOOD TURNING AND PATTERNMAKING SHOP MATHEMATICS AND ELECTRICITY THE ENROLMENT FOR THE SEASON OF I9078 AMOUNTED TO 396 AND THE ATTENDANCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN REMARKABLY CONSTANT SHOWING A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN IS COMMON IN EVENING SCHOOLS IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE FIRST THAT THE EXPENSE OF MAINTAINING THIS IMPORTANT ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF SPRINGFIELD WOULD NOT BE A SERIOUS MATTER AND THE SUCCESSIVE CITY GOVERNMENTS ALMOST INVARIABLY HAVE PROMPTLY VOTED THE MODERATE SUM REQUIRED AS A PIONEER IN THIS MOST PRACTICAL PHASE OF AMERICAN PUBLIC SCHOOL WORK AND ALSO BECAUSE OF ITS PROMPT SUCCESS THE SPRINGFIELD EVENING TRADES SCHOOL ATTRACTED VERY WIDE ATTENTION NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT ALSO ABROAD FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF SPRING FIELD OTHER AMERICAN CITIESNOTABLY CAMBRIDGE HARTFORD AND CLEVELANDHAVE OPENED UP THE SHOPS OF THEIR MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF MECHANICS IN EVENING CLASSES IN EVERY CASE THE RESULTS HAVE AMPLY JUSTIFIED THE PLAN OF UTILIZING THE EQUIP MENT AND TEACHERS OF MANUAL ARTS SCHOOLS ALREADY ESTABLISHED FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF MECHANICS APPRENTICES OR OTHERS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH WORK IN THE MANUAL ARTS IN SUCH PROCESSES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL TRADES AS COULD BE WELL TAUGHT IN THIS WAY THE GENERAL AIM OF THE EVENING TRADES SCHOOLS IS TO GIVE MEN ALREADY EMPLOYED IN THE TRADES A CHANCE TO BROADEN THEIR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND THUS MAKE THEMSELVES MORE EFFICIENT WORKMEN THEY HAVE BEEN SOMETIMES CLASSIFIED AS CONTINUATION SCHOOLS BORROWING A TERM THAT IS MUCH USED IN DESIGNATING EVENING SCHOOLS FOR WORK MEN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES BUT THEY DIFFER FROM FOREIGN CONTINUATION 57THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SCHOOLS IN ONE IMPORTANT RESPECT VIZ IN PLACING THE MAJOR EMPHASIS UPON TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL SHOPS GENERALLY SPEAKING THE OBJECT OF THE CONTINUATION SCHOOLS OF GERMANY AND ENGLAND IS TO EXTEND THE TRAINING OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN LANGUAGE MATHEMATICS DRAWING AND SCIENCE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO APPLICATIONS OF THESE SUBJECTS IN THE LEADING INDUSTRIES OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE SCHOOL IS LOCATED DIRECT TRAINING IN THE USE OF TOOLS AND MACHINES IS LEFT TO THE SHOPS AND FACTORIES WHERE THE MEMBERS OF THE SCHOOL ARE EMPLOYED DURING THE DAY EITHER ON PART TIME OR ON FULL TIME IN SO FAR AS EVENING TRADES SCHOOLS OF THE AMERICAN TYPE GIVE INSTRUC TION IN MATHEMATICS MECHANICAL DRAWING AND SCIENCE THEY RESEMBLE FOREIGN SCHOOLS OF THE KIND REFERRED TO BUT THEIR MAIN OBJECT AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS TO SUPPLEMENT THE IMPERFECT AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED TRAINING OF MODERN SHOPS BY GIVING MACHINE HANDS HELPERS AND APPRENTICES SO FAR AS THERE ARE ANY APPRENTICES AN OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN PRACTICE IN A GREATER VARIETY OF ACTUAL SHOP WORK THAN IS EVER LIKELY TO BE OPEN TO ANY ONE MAN UNDER THE MODERN SYSTEM OF MACHINE PRODUCTION THE MECHANICS CHIEF AIM IN ENTERING THESE SCHOOLS IS TO ACQUIRE A WIDER RANGE OF PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF HIS WORK IN ORDER TO REACH IN HIS TRADE A HIGHER CLASSIFICATION WITH INCREASED WAGES SOME RECENT STATISTICS OF THE SPRINGFIELD EVENING TRADES SCHOOL SHOW PLAINLY THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE CLIENTELE OF SUCH SCHOOLS AND THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THOSE WHO ATTEND THESE FACTS APPEAR IN THE FOLLOWING TABULAR STATEMENT IN WHICH THE FIGURES GIVEN INCLUDE THE ENTIRE ENROLMENT IN THE VARIOUS CLASSES EXPERIENCE IN TRADE TAUGHT NONE  LESS THAN ONE YEAR  ONE TO TWO YEARS  TWO TO THREE YEARS  OVER THREE YEARS  SOME EXPERIENCE IN OTHER EMPLOYMENT  AIM IN TAKING COURSE TO IMPROVE KNOWLEDGE OF TRADE  TO LEARN A TRADE  TO GAIN GENERAL INFORMATION  I6 96 I6 9 I6 I9  6 2 I5 I2 2 13 5 I I9  8 4 42 2 4  I 77 96 21 9 I8 83 I6 II 4 8 88 APPRENTICES IN PLUMBING MERELY BEGINNERS IN OTHER TRADES 28 I4 4 8 8 4 12 I5 7 58PUBLIC EVENING SCHOOLS OF TRADES A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE STATISTICS GIVEN IN THIS TABLE REVEALS SEVERAL INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT ONETHIRD OF THE MEN WERE ENROLLED FOR INSTRUCTION IN THE MECHANICAL DRAWING CLASSES ONLY FOUR PER CENT OF THESE HOWEVER HAD ACTUALLY BEEN EMPLOYED IN THAT LINE OF WORK AND OF THE REMAINING NINETYSIX PER CENT EIGHT PER CENT ONLY WISHED TO BECOME DRAFTSMEN WHILE EIGHTYEIGHT PER CENT WERE ENGAGED PERMANENTLY IN SOME OTHER WORK IN WHICH A KNOWLEDGE OF DRAFTING WOULD BE OF SERVICE THESE FIGURES SUSTAIN IN A MARKED DEGREE THE STATEMENT OFTEN EXPRESSED WITH REFERENCE TO THE EFFECT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS LAW OF I870 WHICH REQUIRES ALL TOWNS IN THE COM MONWEALTH OF TEN THOUSAND INHABITANTS OR MORE TO MAINTAIN AN EVENING DRAFTING SCHOOL CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATION OF SOME OF THE FRAMERS OF THE LAW THESE CLASSES DO NOT TURN OUT DRAFTSMEN IN LARGE NUMBERS BUT THEY AFFORD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MEANING OF WORKING DRAWINGS AND HOW THEY ARE MADEINFORMATION OF GREAT VALUE IN MANY OCCUPATIONS TURNING TO THE TABLE AGAIN WE FIND THAT MORE THAN TWOTHIRDS OF THE ENROLMENT IS FOR INSTRUCTION IN THE STRICTLY MECHANICAL TRADES THIS INDICATES A GREATER DEMAND FOR THE DIRECT SHOP TRAINING PECULIAR TO AMERICAN TRADE SCHOOLS THAN FOR THE BROADER AND MORE GENERAL THOUGH NO LESS PRACTICAL INSTRUCTION GIVEN IN THE CONTINUATION SCHOOLS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED TOO THAT IN THE SPRINGFIELD SCHOOL ALTHOUGH TUITION IS FREE TO ALL RESIDENTS OF THE CITY AN INCIDENTAL FEE VARYING FROM 400 TO 800 IS CHARGED IN THE MACHINE SHOP PLUMBING WOODWORKING AND ELECTRICAL CLASSES WHILE NO FEE AT ALL IS CHARGED FOR MECHANICAL DRAWING THIS FACT MAKES THE LARGER TOTAL ENROLMENT IN THE SHOP CLASSES EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT IT WILL BE NOTED ALSO THAT A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF THOSE ENROLLED IN THE SHOP CLASSES PARTICULARLY IN THE MACHINE SHOP HAD ALREADY HAD SEVERAL YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE TRADES THEY WERE FOL LOWING AND YET THEY FELT THE NEED OF TRADES TEACHING THERE WERE COMPARATIVELY FEW BEGINNERS OR APPRENTICES A CONSIDERABLE PER CENTAGE OF BEGINNERS HOWEVER WAS FOUND IN THE PLUMBING WOOD WORKING AND ELECTRICAL CLASSES AND IN PLUMBING THESE BEGINNERS WERE APPRENTICES FROM THE LOCAL SHOPS BUT IN THE MACHINE SHOP WE FIND THAT NEARLY HALF THE MEN HAD HAD OVER THREE YEARS EXPERIENCE WHILE LESS THAN ONESIXTH OF THE ENROLMENT WAS MADE UP OF BEGINNERS MOST OF THESE MEN KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT MACHINE TOOL WORK THEIR EXPERIENCE HOWEVER HAD BEEN LIMITED TO ONE MACHINE OR AT MOST TO 59THE ALNNALS OF THE AMNERICAN ACADEMY TWO OR THREE THE SCHOOL AFFORDED THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF THE FUNDAMENTAL MACHINE TOOLS OF THE MODERN SHOP AN OPPORTUNITY WHICH THE MODERN SHOP ITSELF DOES NOT AFFORD BUT PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACT OF ALL REVEALED BY THE TABLE IS FOUND IN THE LARGE NUMBERS WHO HAD HAD MORE OR LESS EX PERIENCE IN EMPLOYMENTS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHICH THEY WERE FOL LOWING OR FOR WHICH THEY WISHED TO RECEIVE PREPARATION IN THE TRADES SCHOOL ABOUT THREEFOURTHS OF THOSE ENROLLED IN THE MACHINE SHOP HAD DRIFTED INTO THIS WORK FROM OTHER TRADES OR OCCUPATIONS NEARLY HALF OF THOSE IN THE PLUMBING CLASSES AND IN THE WOODWORKING CLASSES HAD DONE THE SAME THING THIS IS MERELY ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION OF THE WELLKNOWN FACT THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF OUR YOUNG MECHANICS DRIFT ABOUT FROM ONE EMPLOYMENT TO ANOTHER MORE OR LESS UNSKILLED BEFORE THEY FIND THEMSELVES WELL ENOUGH GROUNDED IN ANY TRADE TO BE ABLE TO CLAIM HONESTLY A FAIR KNOWLEDGE OF IT IN FACT THE WELL TRAINED SKILFUL MECHANIC IN ANY TRADE IS RARELY TO BE FOUND OBJECTION WILL BE MADE THAT EVENING TRADES SCHOOLS THOUGH THEY MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOME GOOD IN THE INDUSTRIAL WORLD MUST ALWAYS FALL FAR SHORT OF FULLY SATISFYING THE DEMAND FOR TRAINING IN THE TRADES IT IS TRUE THAT AN IDEAL SCHEME OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION WHICH HAS FOR ITS OBJECT THE UPBUILDING OF ALL LINES OF INDUSTRY AS THE RESULT OF THE TRAINING OF THE WORKERS IN SKILL AND EFFICIENCY WITH OUT NEGLECTING THEIR PHYSICAL INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL WELL BEING MUST ASSUME THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORE THOROUGH AND FAR MORE COM PREHENSIVE PLAN OF OPERATION THAN CAN BE CARRIED OUT IN ANY SYSTEM OF EVENING SCHOOLS BUT THESE SCHOOLS DO NOT CLAIM TO OFFER A COM PLETE AND PERFECT SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION THEY DO OFFER HOWEVER A PARTIAL SOLUTION OF GREAT VALUE WHICH MAY OPEN THE WAY TO A VERY WIDE EXTENSION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL WORK TO MEET THE NEW DEMANDS OF A MACHINEWORKING AGE SO LONG AS EVENING TRADES SCHOOLS DEPEND FOR THEIR EXISTENCE AND FOR THE SCOPE OF THEIR WORK UPON THE SHOPS AND EQUIPMENTS OF MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS WHICH ARE COMPARATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER AND RARELY EXTENSIVE THEIR USEFULNESS MUST BE CONFINED WITHIN COMPARATIVELY NARROW BOUNDS BUT WHY NEED THEY BE THUS CONFINED WHILE THE NEED FOR INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE GREAT PUBLIC QUESTIONS OF THE DAY DEMANDING THE ATTENTION OF EDUCATORS LEGISLATORS AND ALL ASSOCIATIONS OF MEN 60PUBLIC EVENING SCHOOLS OF TRADES INTERESTED IN SOCIAL PROGRESS IT IS ALSO A QUESTION THAT APPEALS TO THE PRIVATE INTERESTS OF THE MANUFACTURER AND THE WAGE EARNER IT THEREFORE CALLS FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS ON THE ONE HAND AS REPRESENTING PUBLIC INTERESTS AND MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIA TIONS AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS ON THE OTHER AS REPRESENTING PRIVATE INTERESTS HERE IS A WIDE FIELD FOR COOPERATION IN WHICH THE MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOLS AS NOW EQUIPPED AND CARRIED ON MAY BE OF SERVICE WHAT THEY NEED AND WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MORE EFFECTIVE IS ENCOURAGEMENT AND ENLARGEMENT THROUGH THE CO OPERATION OF THE OTHER INTERESTS CONCERNED IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO ENLARGE THE EVENING TRADES SCHOOLS AND EXTEND THEIR USE FULNESS UNDER PUBLIC MANAGEMENT IF ALL THE INTERESTS CONCERNED WOULD TAKE HOLD OF THE MATTER EARNESTLY AND CONTRIBUTE THEIR JUST SHARE IN EXPENSE AND EFFORT THIS IS ALREADY BEING DONE IN SOME SECTIONS AND ALL FRIENDS OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION WILL FIND ENCOURAGEMENT IN THE GROWTH OF THE COOPERATIVE SPIRIT IT IS ADMITTED THAT EVENING TRADES SCHOOLS AT THEIR BEST CANNOT FULLY MEET INDUSTRIAL NEEDS THEY HAVE THEIR NATURAL LIMITATIONS THE COURSES WHICH THEY OFFER MUST BE BRIEF AND INTENSELY PRACTICAL EVENING WORK IN ITSELF HOWEVER KEEN THE INTEREST LACKS THE FRESH NESS AND VITALITY OF SIMILAR EDUCATIONAL WORK DONE IN THE DAYTIME THE CLIENTELE OF THE EVENING SCHOOLS IS NATURALLY MADE UP OF THOSE BEYOND THE ORDINARY SCHOOL AGE OR OF ADULTS BECAUSE THE NEED FOR THIS TRAINING HAS BEEN IMPRESSED UPON THEM BY THEIR FIRST CONTACT WITH INDUSTRIAL LIFE NOT ALL THE WORKERS HOWEVER HAVE COME THROUGH THE YEARS OF TRANSITION BETWEEN THE PERIOD OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IF THEY HAD ANY AND THE AGE WHEN THEIR PRODUCTIVE WORK SHOULD BEGIN WITH A DESIRE FOR TRAINING AND AN APPRECIATION OF ITS VALUE THE GREATEST INDUSTRIAL NEED IS AN EFFECTIVE PLAN FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL RESOURCES THIS PROBLEM WILL FIND ITS BEST SOLUTION WITHOUT DOUBT IN DAY TRADES SCHOOLS MEANTIME AND PERHAPS FOR MANY YEARS EVENING TRADES SCHOOLS HAVE THEIR MISSION THEY WILL ATTRACT LARGE NUMBERS AND A GREAT VARIETY OF WORKMEN THOSE WHO ATTEND THEM WILL ALWAYS HAVE A DEFINITE AND SINCERE PURPOSE AND THEY WILL SECURE PROMPTLY THE TRAINING AND INFORMATION WHICH THEY NEED THE LABORER THE EMPLOYER AND THE TAXPAYER WILL APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUCTION SUCH SCHOOLS CANNOT FAIL TO GIVE A DIRECT PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO MUCH OF OUR PRESENT INDUSTRIAL NEED THIS ALONE WOULD BE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY EVERY EFFORT THAT MAY BE 6ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEZMY MADE FOR THEIR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT BUT THESE SCHOOLS SHOULD INTEREST THE FRIENDS OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION FOR ANOTHER REASON THEY WILL TEACH BY EXAMPLE THE POSSIBILITY OF TRADE TRAINING UNDER PUBLIC AUSPICES AND SHOW THE VALUE OF IT TO THE MANUFACTURER TO THE WAGEEARNER AND TO THE COMMUNITIES WHICH BOTH SERVE THIS WILL BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE IN THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF CREATING A COMPLETE AND

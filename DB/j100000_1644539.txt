Contest at Storrs during the year 191314 and 1914 15 3 are laid beside those presented here from the Vineland data The essential constants appear in the ac companying table This gives the per cent of the flock which did and which did not lay during the months of the first year in which any considerable proportion of the birds did not lay The average annual production for these birds in the first year of both the Storrs 191314 and 1914 15 and the Vineland 1916 17 contests and in the second year 191718 of the Vineland contest are shown While the actual differences in egg preduction are the data of practical significance com parison between the three series is facilitated by expressing the differences between these annual means for the birds of the two classes as percentages of the actual annual average productions4 of the flock Considering first the records of the pullet year we note that for the Storrs series the birds which laid in any given month show an average annual pullet year egg production of from 274 to 828 eggs higher than those which did not lay or from 179 to 541 per cent For the Vineland series the difference in the production of the two groups ranges from 367 to 655 eggs or from 211 to 376 per cent Thus the difference in the annual egg production of the birds which did and which did not lay in any given month as well as the percentage of the birds which are not laying varies greatly according to the month considered During the months of November December and January the percentage differences in the annual produc tion of the two groups of birds is higher in the Vineland than in the Storrs series whereas for the other months of the eight considered the reverse is true The average percentage difference is 304 in the Storrs series and 266 in the Vineland series 3 Harris Blakeslee and Kirkpatrick loc cit p 42 4 These are 15319 eggs for the first year at Storrs 17405 eggs for the first year at Vineland and 13979 eggs for the second year at Vineland Thus the constants show conspicuous differ ences of great practical significance in the first pullet year records of birds which did and those which did not lay during the individual months of the first year The results for the first year records at Storrs and the first year records at Vineland are in fair agreement Turning to the second year means we note that for each of the eight months of the first year used as a basis of selection for an in crease of second year preduction the second year record of birds is higher if they laid dur ing the special month under consideration in the first year than if they did not lay in that month The differences between the groups amount to about two dozen eggs or more per bird in five of the eight months considered It is clear therefore that so simple a criterion as laying vs non laying in the first year may furnish a criterion of some value for the selection of the birds to be retained in the flock for breeding and for second year production J ARTHUR HARRIS HARRY R LEWIS

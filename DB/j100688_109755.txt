J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109755,ON SOME COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR AND ON SOME OTHER SUBJECTS OF CHEMICAL INQUIRY ABSTRACT,I207043,440 AND HIS DESCRIPTIONS ARE ACCOMPANIED WITH DRAWINGS OF VARIOUS PECU LIARITIES OF STRUCTURE OF THE BIRDS THAT LIVE ON ANIMAL FOOD THE AUTHOR HAS EXAMINED SEVERAL KINDS OF FALCON THE SOLAND GOOSE THE CRANE THE CORMORANT THE COMMON GULL AND THE SNOWBIRD THE LAST OF WHICH DIFFERS CON SIDERABLY FROM THE REST AMONG GRAMINIVOROUS BIRDS THE SWAN AND GOOSE ARE NOTICED AS DIFFERING FROM MOST OTHERS IN THE SITUATION AND STRUCTURE OF THESE GLANDS OTHERS OF THIS TRIBE HERE EXAMINED ARE THE TURKEY THE CAS SOWARY THE AMERICAN OSTRICH AND THE AFRICAN OSTRICH IN THE THREE LAST THE SOLVENT GLANDS ARE IN A CAVITY OF UNUSUAL SIZE AND THE MUS CULAR STRUCTURE OF THE GIZZARD IS UNCOMMONLY WEAK WHICH THE AUTHOR CONCEIVES TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE MODE OF PROGRESSIVE MOTION WHICH IS THE SAME IN THESE BIRDS AND MAY SERVE TO GRIND THE FOOD WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF STRONG MUSCULAR ACTION ON SOME COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR AND ON SOME OTHER SUBJECTS OF CHEMICAL INQUIRY BY SIR HUMPHRY DAVY KNT LLD SEC RS READ JUNE 18 1812 PHIL TRANS 1812 P 405 THE AUTHOR HAS FORMERLY DESCRIBED TO THE SOCIETY TWO COMPOUNDS CONSISTING OF PHOSPHORUS AND OXYMURIATIC ACID OR CHLORINE ONE OF THEM IS A SOLID COMPOUND AND BY HIS PRESENT EXPERIMENTS CONSISTS OF THREE PARTS OF PHOSPHORUS COMBINED WITH TWENTY OF CHLORINE THE SECOND COMPOUND CONTAINS ONLY HALF THIS QUANTITY OF CHLORINE AND IS A FLUID HAVING THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF 146 THE FLUID WILL ALSO DIS SOLVE A STILL FURTHER QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORUS BUT THE AUTHOR HAS NOT ASCERTAINED WHETHER THERE IS ANY DEFINITE LIMIT TO THE PROPORTION SO DISSOLVED WHEN THIS FLUID COMPOUND IS TREATED WITH WATER IT FORMS A THICK FLUID OF THE CONSISTENCE OF SYRUP THAT CRYSTALLIZES SLOWLY BY COOLING THESE CRYSTALS MAY BE CALLED HYDROPHOSPHOROUS ACID FOR BY HEAT THEY ARE DECOMPOUNDED INTO PHOSPHORIC ACID AND A PECULIAR GAS CONSIST ING OF PHOSPHORUS AND HYDROGEN THIS GAS DIFFERS FROM COMMON PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN IN NOT BEING SPONTANEOUSLY INFLAMMABLE WHEN MIXED WITH COMMON AIR AND IN BEING CONSIDERABLY LESS FETID THAN THAT GAS THE PROPORTIONS OF ITS CONSTITUENT PARTS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE FOUR HYDROGEN WITH TWENTY PHOSPHORUS THE PHOSPHORIC ACID CONTAINED IN THE CRYSTALS DERIVED ITS ORIGIN FROM THE WATER ADDED TO THE ORIGINAL FLUID WHILE THE HYDROGEN OF THE WATER ESCAPED WITH THE CHLORINE IN THE FORM OF MURIATIC GAS IN THE INTERCHANGE OF ELEMENTS WHICH TAKES PLACE IN THESE COMBI NATIONS THERE ARE MANY CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURABLE TO ASCERTAINING THE PROPORTIONS IN WHICH THE SEVERAL ELEMENTS UNITE WITH EACH OTHER AND THE AUTHOR OBSERVES THE RESULTS ACCORD REMARKABLY WELL WITH OTHER DETERMINATIONS IN THE SAME MANNER RESPECTING SULPHUR A SIMILAR ACCORDANCE BE TWEEN THE PROPORTIONS BY WEIGHT IN WHICH IT UNITES WITH DIFFERENT ELEMENTS CONFIRMS OTHER ESTIMATES OF THE ELEMENTARY NUMBER FIT TO441 EXPRESS THE RELATION OF THIS BODY TO HYDROGEN THE UNIT OF THLE SCALE FOR SINCE IN SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN THE HYDROGEN IS NOT ALTERED IN BULK BY THE SULPHUR IT HOLDS IN SOLUTION THE INCREASE OF WEIGHT SHOWS THE PROPORTION OF SULPHUR COMBINED AND SO LIKEWISE IN SULPHUROUS ACID GAS THE BULK IS NOT GREATER THAN THAT OF THE OXYGEN WHICH IT CONTAINS AND SINCE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS DOUBLE THAT OF OXYGEN THE INCREASE PROVES THAT SULPHUR IN THIS INSTANCE HAS COMBINED WITH AN EQUAL WEIGHT OF OXYGEN WHEN SULPHUR COMBINES WITH A LARGER PRO PORTION OF OXYGEN THE PRESENCE OF WATER APPEARS TO BE REQUISITE AS THE MEDIUM OF UNION IN THE PHOSPHORIC ACID ON THE CONTRARY WATER IS NOT NECESSARY FOR UNITING THE FULL PROPORTION OF OXYGEN WITH WHICH PHOSPHORUS IS CAPABLE OF COMBINING WITH RESPECT TO THE WATER THAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED TO BE RETAINED BY MANY EARTHS AND METALLIC PRECIPITATES IT IS REMARKED THAT THIS IS PROBABLY COMBINED WITH THEM IN DEFINITE PROPORTION AND THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE WATER HAS CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON THEIR COLOURS AND ON OTHER PROPERTIES ON A NEW DETONATING COMPOUND IN A LETTER FROM SIR HUMPHRY DAVY LLD FRS TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART KB PRS READ NOVEMBER 5 1812 PHIL TRANS 1813 P 1 THE PRESENT ACCOUNT IS INTENDED AS A CAUTION TO OTHERS AGAINST THE DANGEROUS EFFECTS OF THE VERY EXPLOSIVE DETONATION BY WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS HIMSELF BEEN A SUFFERER HIS ATTENTION WAS FIRST DIRECTED TO THE SUBJECT BY A LETTER RECEIVED FROM FRANCE MENTIONING THAT ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS SINCE A COMPOUND HAD BEEN DISCOVERED OF AZOTE WITH CHLORINE WHICH APPEARS IN THE FORM OF AN OIL HEAVIER THAN WATER AND WHICH EXPLODES BY A GENTLE HEAT WITH ALL THE VIOLENCE OF THE FULMINATING METALS THE LETTER ADDS THAT THIS DISCOVERY COST THE OPERATOR AN EYE AND A FINGER SINCE THE LETTER CONTAINED NO ACCOUNT OF THE MODE OF PREPARING THE COMPOUND AND AS NONE COULD BE FOUND IN ANY OF THE FRENCH JOURNALS SIR HUMPHRY DAVY PURSUED A HINT GIVEN HIM BY MR CHILDREN WHO INFORMED HIM THAT HIS FRIEND MR BURTON HAD IN THE MONTH OF JULY LAST OBSERVED THE FORMATION OF A VOLATILE OILY SUBSTANCE IN A SOLUTION OF NITRATE OF AMMONIA EXPOSED TO CHLORINE IN THE STATE OF GAS IN REPEATING THE EXPERIMENT THE AUTHOR PERCEIVED FIRST AN OILY FILM ON THE SURFACE OF THE FLUID WHICH GRADUALLY COLLECTED INTO SMALL GLOBULES AND FELL TO THE BOTTOM ONE OF THESE GLOBULES BEING TAKEN OUT WHILE FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND SLIGHTLY WARMED EXPLODED WITH BRILLIANT LIGHT BUT WITH OUT ANY VIOLENCE OF DETONATION IN A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS CARRIED ON JOINTLY WITH MIR CHILDREN AND MR WARBURTON OTHER AMMONIACAL SOLUTIONS WERE SUBSTITUTED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SAME PRODUCT WAS OBTAINED BY MEANS OF OXALATE OF AMMONIA OR BY A WEAK SOLUTION OF PURE AMMONIA THE FIRST INSTANCE THAT OCCURRED OF VIOLENT EXPLOSION WAS IN THEIR ENDEA VOURS TO FORM LARGER QUANTITIES IN A WOLFES APPARATUS BY A SERIES OF BOTTLES CONTAINING THE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS

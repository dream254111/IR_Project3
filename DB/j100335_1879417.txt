j100335,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,1879417,The Tariff 18301860,i332262,THE TARIFF 18301860 IN the years between 1832 and 1860 there was great vacillation in the tariff policy of the United States there were also great fluctuations in the course of trade and industry A high tariff succeeded a low tariff and was in turn succeeded by another low tariff Periods of undue inflation and of great demoralization of prosperity and of depression followed each other The changes in the rates of duty and the fluctuations in industrial history have often been thought to be closely connected Protec tionists have ascribed prosperity to high tariffs depression to low tariffs free traders have reversed the inference It is the object of the present paper to trace so far as this can be done the economic effect of tariff legislation dur ing the thirty years of varying fortune that preceded the civil war First by way of introduction a sketch must be given of the history of the tariff We begin with the tariff act of 1832 a distinctly protectionist measure passed by the Whigs or National Republicans which put the protective system in a shape such as the advocates of protection hoped it might retain permanently It levied high duties on cotton and woolen goods iron and other articles to which protection was meant to be applied On articles not produced in the United States either low duties were imposed as on silks or no duties at all as on tea and coffee The average rate on dutiable articles was about 34 per cent In 1833 the Compromise Tariff Act was passed and remained in force until 1842 That act there can be little doubt was the result of an agreement between Clay and Calhoun the leaders of the protectionists and freeTHE TARIFF 18301860 315 traders while it secured also the support of the Jackson administration Clay had been hitherto the most uncom promising of the protectionists Calhoun had represented the extreme Southern demand that duties should be re duced to a horizontal level of 15 or 20 per cent The compromise provided for the retention of a considerable degree of protection for nearly nine years and thereafter for a rapid reduction to a uniform 20 per cent rate The tariff of 1832 was the startingpoint All duties which in that tariff exceeded 20 per cent were to have onetenth of the excess over 20 per cent taken off on January 1 1834 onetenth more on January 1 1836 again one tenth in 1838 and another in 1840 That is by 1840 fourtenths of the excess over 20 per cent would be gone Then on January 1 1842 onehalf the remaining excess was to be taken off and on July 1 1842 the other half of the remaining excess was to go After July 1 1842 therefore there would be a uniform rate of 20 per cent on all articles Obviously the reduction was very grad ual from 1833 till 1842 while in the first six months Qf 1842 a sharp and sudden reduction was to take place Considered as a political measure the act of 1833 may deserve commendation As an economic or financial measure there is little to be said for it It was badly drafted No provision was made in it as to specific duties yet it was obviously meant to apply to such duties and the Secretary of the Treasury had to take it on himself to frame rules as to the manner of ascertaining the ad valorem equivalents of specific duties and making the reductions called for by the act4t Again the reduc  The Nullifiers had said that such a horizontal rate was the least they were willing to accept See the Address to the People of the United States by the South Carolina Convention in the volume of State Papers on Nullification published by the State of Massachusetts p 69 f The instructions issued from the Treasury Department may be found in Exec Doc 183334 vol i No 43 It has been thought that the act did not apply to specific duties but this is a mistake316 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS tions of duty were irregular Thus on one important article rolled bar iron the duty of 1832 had been specific 150 per hundredweight This was equivalent at the prices of 1832 to about 95 per cent The progress of the reductions is shown in the table Up to 1842 they were comparatively moderate but in the six months from Jan uary 1 to July 1 1842 the duty dropped from 65 to 20 per centt Producers and dealers necessarily found it hard to deal with such changes It is true that a long warning was given them but on the other hand Con gress might at any moment interfere and modify the act Finally and not least among the objections there was the ultimate horizontal rate of 20 per cent a crude and indiscriminating method of dealing with the tariff prob lem which can be defended on no ground of principle or expediency The 20 per cent rate according to the terms of the act was to remain in force indefinitely that being the concession which in the end was made to the extremists of the Southt As it happened however the 20 per cent duty remained in force for but two months from July 1 till September 1 1842 At the latter date the tariff act of 1842 went Year Duty per cent 1834 87 1836 80 1838 725 1840 65 Jan 1 1842 425 July 1 1842 20 t This calculation is on the basis of the prices of 1833 If prices changed and they did change greatly the rates under the Compromise Act would vary materially from those given in the text since the ad valorem equivalent of the specific duty and its excess over 20 per cent were ascertained for each year according to the prices of that year I Clay who drafted the act probably had no expectation that the 20 per cent rate ever would go into effect He thought Congress would amend before 1842 and intended to meet by his compromise the immediate emer gency only See his Works ii pp 131 132 He tried to show Appleton and Davis two leading representatives of the protectionists that no future Congress would be bound by the act See Appletons speech on the Tariff Act of 1842 Appendix to Congr Globe 184142 p 575  The Compromise Act was so loosely constructed that doubt was enter tained whether under its terms any duties at all could be collected after JuneTHE TARIFF 18301860 317 in force That act was passed by the Whigs as a party measure and its history is closely connected with the political complications of the time The Whigs had broken with President Tyler and had a special quarrel with him as to the distribution among the States of the proceeds of the public lands Tyler vetoed two successive tariff bills because of clauses in them in regard to distribu tion The bill which he finally signed and which became law was passed hurriedly without the distribution clause Attention was turned mainly to the political quarrel and to the political effect of the bill in general The act naturally enough was a hasty and imperfect measure of which the details had received little consideration The duties which it levied were high probably higher than they would have been had the tariff discussion been less affected by the breach beween Tyler and the Whigs The act though distinctly protective and proclaimed to be such by the Whigs had not behind it such a strong popular feeling as had existed in favor of the protective measures of 1824 1828 and 1832 In the farming States the enthusiasm for the home market idea had cooled per ceptibly and in the manufacturing States the agitation came rather from the producers directly interested than from the public at large There is much truth in Cal houns remark that the act of 1842 was passed not so much in compliance with the wishes of the manufact urers as because the politicians wanted an issuet 30 1842 The point was carried before the Supreme Court which decided however that the rate of 20 per cent was in effect during the two months before the act of 1842 went in force Aldridge v Williams 3 Howard 9 Mr Justice McLean dissented and there is much force to his dissenting opinion and to the argument of Mr Reverdy Johnson the counsel against the government A full account of this struggle is in Von Holsts Constitutional History iii pp 451463 t Works iv pp 199 200 Calhoun thought that a good deal was due also to the influence of the  moneyed men  who wanted the Treasury to be filled318 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS The act of 1842 remained in force for but four years It was in turn superseded by the act of 1846 again a political measure passed this time by the Democrats The act of 1846 carried out the suggestions made by Sec retary Walker in his much debated Treasury Report of 1845 Indeed it may be regarded as practically framed by Walker who professed to adhere to the principle of free trade and the act of 1846 is often spoken of as an instance of the application of freetrade principles In fact however it effected no more than a moderation in the application of protection The act established several schedules indicated by the letters A B C D and so on All the articles classed in schedule A paid 100 per cent all in schedule B paid 40 per cent all in schedule C paid 30 per cent and so for the rest Schedule C with the 30 per cent duty included most articles with which the protective controversy is concerned iron and metals in general manufactures of metals wool and woollens man ufactures of leather paper glass and wood Cottons were in schedule D and paid 25 per cent Tea and coffee on the other hand were exempt from duty The act of 1846 remained in force till 1857 when a still further reduction of duties was made The revenue was redundant in 1857 and this was the chief cause of the reduction of duties The framework of the act of 1846 was retainedthe schedules and the ad valorem duties The duty on the important protective articles in schedule C was lowered to 24 per cent cottons being transferred moreover to that schedule Certain raw materials were at the same time admitted free of duty The act of 1857 remained in force till the close of the period we have under examination We begin with a high protective tariff in 1832 then follows a gradual reduction of duties ending in 1842 with a brief period of very low duties In the four years 184246 we have a strong application of protection In 1846 begins whatTHE TARIFF 18301860 319 is often called a period of free trade but is in reality one of moderated protection In 1857 the protection is still further moderated and for a few years there is as near an approach to free trade as the country has had since 1816 Turning now to the economic effect of this legislation we have to note first its connection with the general pros perity of the country That there was a distinct connec tion is asserted by both protectionists and free traders The protectionists tell us that the compromise tariff caused the disastrous crises of 1837 and 1839 that the high tariff of 1842 brought back prosperity that depression again followed the passage of the act of 1846 and that the panic of 1857 was precipitated by the tariff act of 1857 On the other hand free traders not infrequently describe the period between 1846 and 1860 as one of exceptional prosperity due to the low duties then in force It would not be worth while to allude to some of these assertions if they were not so firmly embedded in current literature and so constantly repeated in many accounts of our industrial history This is especially the case with the curious assertion that the crises of 1837 and 1839 were caused by the compromise tariff of 1833 or con nected with it This assertion had its origin in the writ ings of Henry C Carey who has been guilty of many curious versions of economic history but of none more remarkable than this It may be found in various pas sages in his works and from them it has been transferred to the writings of his disciples and to the arguments of protectionist authors and speakers in general Yet no References to the supposed effects of the act of 1833 abound in Careys works As good a specimen as any is this  Agitation succeeded in producing a total change of system in the tariff of 1833  Thenceforward the building of furnaces and mills almost wholly ceased the wealthy English capitalists having thus succeeded in regaining the desired control of the great American market for cloth and iron As a consequence of their triumph there ensued a succession of crises of barbaric tendency the whole terminating in 1842 in a320 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS fairminded person having even a superficial knowledge of the economic history of these years can entertain such notions The crises of 1837 and 1839 were obviously due to quite a different set of causes to the bank troubles the financial mistakes of Jacksons administra tion the inflation of the currency and of those general conditions of speculation and unduly expanded credit which give rise to crises The tariff act had nothing whatever to do with them Indeed the reductions in duty under it as we have seen were slight until 1840 and could hardly have influenced in any degree the break ing out of the panics Even if the reductions of duty had been greater and had been made earlier they would prob ably have had no effect favorable or unfavorable on the inflation of the earlier years or on the depression which followed We may dispose at this point of a similar assertion occa sionally made in regard to the crisis of 1857 that the tariff act of 1857 caused or intensified it This view also is traceable probably to Carey It appears in his writings scene of ruin such as had never before been known bankruptcy among the people being almost universal etc Letters on the Iron Question 1865 p 4 printed in his Miscellaneous Works 1872 To the same effect see his Finan cial Crises p 18 Review of Wellss Report p 5 Social Science ii p 225 Professor Thompson makes the same statement in his Political Economy p 353 See also Elder Questions of the Day 1871 pp 200 201 Senator Evarts in a speech made in 1883 ascribed to the act of 1833  a bankruptcy which covered the whole land without distinction of sections with ruin The pedigree of statements of this kind which are frequent in campaign literature can be traced back to Carey Doubtless Carey wrote in good faith but his preju dices were so strong as to prevent him from taking a just view of economic history Oddly enough Calhoun ascribed the crisis of 1837 to the fact that duties under the act of 1833 remained too high The high duties brought in a large revenue and caused a surplus in the Treasury the deposit and distribution of this brought inflation and speculation and eventually a crisis Works iv p 174 No doubt the high duties were one cause of the government surplus and thereby aided in bringing about the crisis so that this view incomplete as it is has more foundation than Careys explanation On the other hand Clay not unnaturally took pains to deny that the act of 1833 had anything to do with the troubles of the years following its passage Works ii pp 530 531 edition of 1844THIE TARIFF 18301860 321 and in those of his disciples In fact the crisis of 1857 was an unusually simple case of activity speculation overbanking panic and depression and it requires the exercise of great ingenuity to connect it in any way with the tariff act As it happened indeed the tariff was passed with some hope that it would serve to prevent the crisis Money was accumulating in the Treasury and it was hoped that by reducing duties the revenue would be diminished money would be got out of the Treasury and the stringency which was already threatening pre ventedt The reduction failed to prevent the panic but at the time it would have been considered very odd to ascribe the disaster to the tariff act On the other hand it has been very often said that the activity of trade in 184344 was due to the enactment of the protective tariff act of 1842 There may be a de gree of truth in this The unsettled state of legislation on the tariff before the act of 1842 was passed must have been an obstacle to the revival of confidence After July 1 1842 there was the uniform duty of 20 per cent nay it was doubtful whether there was by law even that duty in force It was certain that Congress would wish not to retain the horizontal rate but would try to enact a new tariff law yet the quarrel between the Whigs and Tyler made the issue quite doubtful Such uncertainty neces sarily operated as a damper on trade and the passage of any act whatever settling the tariff question for the time being would have removed one great obstacle to the return of activity and prosperity It is even possible that the passage of the act of 1842 may have had a more direct Carey speaks in one place of the terrific freetrade crisis of 1857 Letters to Colfax p 15 Financial Crises p 8 Review of Wells p 5 all in his Miscellaneous Works Thompson Political Economy p 357 says In 1857 Congress reduced the duties 25 per cent    It at once intensified all the unwholesome tendencies in our commercial and industrial life

Hunter ibid 329322 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS effect than this No doubt in the regular recurrence of waves of activity and depression the depression of 1840 42 would soon have been followed in any event by a period of activity The point at which activity will begin to show itself under such circumstances is largely a matter of chance It begins for some perhaps accidental reason with one industry or set of industries and the materials for general revival being ready then spreads quickly to the others In the same way when the materials for a crisis are at hand a single accidental failure may precipitate a general panic In 184243 the high duties of the tariff act probably helped to make profits large for the time being in certain manufactures notably those of cotton and iron Prosperity in these set in and may have been the signal for a general revival of confidence and for a general extension of business operations To that extent it is not impossible that the protective tariff of 1842 was the occasion of the reviving business of the ensuing years But it is a very different thing from this to say that the tariff was the cause of prosperity and that depression would have continued indefinitely but for the reestablish ment of high protective duties In truth there has been a great deal of loose talk about tariffs and crises Whenever there has been a crisis the free traders or protectionists as the case may be have been tempted to use it as a means for overthrowing the system they opposed Cobden found in the depression of 183940 a powerful argument in his crusade against the corn laws and knew that a return of prosperity would work against him Within a few years the opponents of protection in this country have found in general de pression a convenient and effective argument against the tariff In the same way the protectionists have been tempted to use the crises of 1837 and 1857 and conversely the revival of 184344 to help their case But the effect of tariffs cannot be traced by any such roughandready  See passages in Morleys Life of Cobden pp 162 163 210THE TARIFF 18301860 323 method The tariff system of a country is but one of many factors entering into its general prosperity Its influence good or bad may be strengthened or may be counteracted by other causes and it is exceedingly diffi cult generally impossible to trace its separate effect Least of all can its influence be traced in those variations of outward prosperity and depression which are marked by good times and crises A protective tariff may sometimes strengthen other causes which are bringing on a commercial crisis Some such effect is very likely to be traced to the tariff in the years before the crisis of 1873 It may sometimes be the occasion of a revival of activity when the other conditions are already favorable to such a revival That may have been the case in 1843 But these are only incidental effects and lie quite outside the real problem as to the results of protection As a rule the tariff system of a country operates neither to cause nor to prevent crises They are the results of conditions of exchange and production on which it can exercise no great or permanent influence Remarks of the same kind may be made on the fre quent assertion that the prosperity of the country from 1846 to 1860 can be traced to the low duties then in force He who is convinced on grounds of general rea soning and of general experience that the principles of free trade are sound and that protective duties are harm ful can fairly deduce the conclusion that the moderate tariffs of 1846 and 1857 contributed so far as they went to general prosperity But a direct connection cannot be traced A number of favorable causes were at work such as the general advance in the arts the rapid growth of the railway system and of ocean communication the Californian gold discoveries There is no way of elimi nating the other factors and determining how much can be ascribed to the tariff alone Even in the growth of international trade where some direct point of connec324 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS tion might be found we cannot measure the effect of low duties for international trade was growing between all countries under the influence of cheapened transportation and the stimulus of the great gold discoveries The in ductive or historical method absolutely fails us here We turn now to another inquiry as to the effect of the fluctuating duties of this period on the protected indus tries That inquiry it is hardly necessary to say leads us to no conclusion as to the effect of the duties on the welfare of the country at large It is quite conceivable and indeed on grounds of general reasoning at least prob able that any stimulus given to the protected industries indicated a loss in the productive powers of the com munity as a whole But it has often been asserted and again often denied that the duties caused a growth of certain industries and it is worth while to trace if we can the tangible effect in this direction even though it be but a part of the total effect It is the production of iron in the unmanufactured form that has been most often discussed in the protective controversy And in regard to this fortunately we have good if not complete information The duty on pig iron had been 621 cents a hundred weight under the tariff act of 1828 In 1832 it was reduced to 50 cents or 10 per ton This rate was equivalent to about 40 per cent on the foreign price at  The growth of foreign trade under the tariffs of 1846 and 1857 was

made 30 per cent on the value and in 1857 24 per cent As the value varied the duty under these acts of course also varied In 1847 a time of high prices the duty of 30 per cent was equal to 575 per ton

duties were reduced under the Compromise Act and as we have seen the reduction on rolled bar was very great and in 1842 very sudden Under the act of 1842 the duty on hammered bar was made 17 per ton that on rolled bar 25 per ton The act of 1846 gave up finally the discrimination between the two kinds and admitted both alike at a duty of 30 per cent and the act of 1857 admitted them at 24 per

1410 340 t Between 1832 and 1842 an exception had been made for one class of rolled iron iron rails actually laid down on railroads These were admitted326 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS For the understanding of the effect of the duties it will be necessary to refer to the tables in the Appendix of the production and importation of iron As will be seen from the explanations in the notes to that table the statistics are by no means completely trustworthy but they enable us to draw some general conclusions It seems to be pretty clear that the importation of iron was somewhat affected by the tariff The years before 1842 when the compromise tariff was in force were years of such disturbance that it is not easy to trace any effects clearly to the operation of the tariff but imports during these years were a smaller proportion of the total con sumption of iron than they were during the period after 1846 It must be remembered that from 1830 till 1842 all railroad iron was admitted free of duty and that a large part of the imported iron consisted of rails If this quantity be deducted from the total import the remaining quantity which alone was affected by the duties becomes still smaller as compared with the domestic product In 1841 and 1842 when duties began to be low under the operation of the Compromise Act imports were larger in proportion to the home product On the other hand in the four years 184346 under the act of 1842 they show a distinct decrease After 1847 they show as dis tinct an increase and continue to be large throughout the period until 1860 In the speculative and railroadbuild ing years from 1852 to 1857 the importation was espe cially heavy and in 1853 and 1854 the total quantity of iron imported was almost as great as the home product The most effective part of the iron duties until 1846 was the heavy discriminating duty on rolled bar iron That duty amounted from 1818 till 1846 except during a few months in 1842 to about 100 per cent Rolled free of duty or rather a drawback was granted of the full amount of duty due or paid on them Between 1828 and 1832 a drawback had been granted such as to make the duty on railroad iron only 25 per cent After 1842 how ever it was charged with duty like any other ironTHE TARIFF 18301860 327 iron made by the puddling process and by rolling is the form of bar iron now in common use The process was first applied successfully by Cort in England about 1785 and in that country was immediately put into extensive use It made bar iron much more cheaply and plentifully than the old process of refining in a forge and under a hammer and at the present time hammered bar of the oldfashioned kind has ceased to be made except in com paratively small quantities for special purposes Corts processes of puddling and rolling were possible only through the use of bituminous coal and coke The abun cdant and excellent coal of Great Britain gave that country an enormous advantage in producing rolled iron as it had already done in smelting pig iron and put her in that commanding position as an iron producer which she con tinues to occupy to the present day When rolled iron first began to be exported from England to foreign coun tries it aroused strong feelings of jealousy being so much cheaper than other iron Several countries fought against the improvement by imposing discriminating duties on it That course was adopted in the United States In 1818 a discriminating duty was put on rolled iron partly be cause it was said to be inferior in quality to hammered iron and partly from a feeling in favor of protecting the domestic producers of hammered iron The duty was re tained as we have seen till 1846 Its effect was neutral ized in part by the free admission of railroad iron which was one form of rolled iron but so far as it was applied to rolled iron in general it simply prevented the United States from sharing the benefit of a great improvement in the arts It had no effect in hastening the use of the puddling and rolling processes in the country Though introduced into the United States as early as 1817 these  In France a discriminating duty equivalent to 120 per cent was

no firm hold until after anthracite coal began to be used about 1840 as an ironmaking fuel We turn now to the history of the domestic production By far the most important event in that history is the use of anthracite coal as a fuel which began about 1840 The substitution of anthracite for wood charcoal revo lutionized the iron trade in the United States in the same way as the use of bituminous coal coke had revolution ized the English iron trade nearly a century before Up to 1840 pig iron had been smelted in this country with charcoal which was an expensive fuel and tended to become more and more expensive as the nearer forests were cut down and wood became less easily attainable Charcoal pig iron could not have competed on even terms with the coalmade English iron But between 1860 and 1840 it was protected by the heavy duties on English iron and under their shelter the production in those  The first puddling and rolling mill in the United States was put up in Pennsylvania in 1817 The first puddling in New England was done as late as 1835 Wood was used as fuel at the outset Swank Iron in All Ages pp 166 330 The effect of the duty on rolled iron cannot be better described than in the clear and forcible language used by Gallatin in 1831  It seems impracti cable that iron made with charcoal can ever compete with iron made from bituminous coal A happy application of anthracite coal to the manufact ure of iron the discovery of new beds of bituminous coal the erection of iron works in the vicinity of the most easterly beds now existing and the improved means of transportation which may bring this at a reasonable rate to the sea border may hereafter enable the American ironmaster to compete in cheap ness with foreign rolled iron in the Atlantic districts On those contingencies the tariff can have no effect To persist in the present state of the manu facture in that particular competition and for that purpose to proscribe the foreign rolled iron is to compel the people for an indefinite time to substitute a dear for a cheap article It is said that the British iron is generally of inferior quality this is equally true of a portion of that made in America In both cases the consumer is the best judgehas an undoubted right to judge for himself Domestic charcoal iron should confine itself to a com petition with the foreign iron made from the same fuel Gallatin added prophetically  Your memorialists believe that the ultimate reduction of the price of American iron to that of British rolled iron can only and ultimately will be accomplished in that Western region which abounds with ore and in which are found the most extensive formations of bituminous coal Menrorial of the Free Trade Convention pp 60 61THE TARIFF 18301860 329 years steadily increased There seems to be no doubt that with lower duties or no duties at all the domestic production would have been less and the imports greater In other words the duty operated as a true protective duty hampering international trade and increasing the price of the home product as well as of the imported iron In 1840 however anthracite coal began to be applied to the making of pig iron The use of anthracite was made possible by the hot blasta process first put in successful operation in England and then transferred to this country by persons who had seen it in Englandt The importance of the new method was immediately appreciated and pre dictions were made that henceforth there would be no longer occasion for importing iron even under the 20 per cent duty of the Compromise Act Many furnaces were changed from the charcoal to the anthracite method4 At very nearly the same time as it happened the tariff act of 1842 was passed imposing heavy duties on all kinds of iron among others on the railroad iron which had hitherto been admitted free Very shortly afterwards a general revival of trade set in Under the influence of these combined causes the production of iron was sud denly increased Between 1842 and 1847 it is said to have more than doubled Some part of this great increase was certainly due to the high protection of 1842 but under any circumstances the use of anthracite would The reader will bear in mind what was said in a previous note on the unsatisfactory character of the statistics f The hot blast was successfully applied in a furnace in

shown by the course of events under the tariff acts of 1846 and 1857 The production remained on the whole very steady throughout the years when these acts were in force For a few years after the passage of the act of 1846 the reduction of the duty to 30 per cent had little if any effect Prices were high both in England and in the United States for it was a time of active railroad building in England and consequently of great demand for iron The ad valorem duty was correspondingly high In 185051 the usual reaction set in prices went down production decreased and the ironmasters complained But the natural revival came after a year or two Prices rose again production increased and continued to in crease until 1860 Although the duty which had been 9 a ton under the act of 1842 was no more than 3 and 4 under the 24 per cent rate which was in force during the years 1858 1859 and 1860 and although these were not years of unusual general activity the domestic pro duction showed a steady growth The country was grow ing fast many railroads were in course of construction much iron was needed An undiminished home product was consumed as well as largely increased imports The most significant fact in the iron trade however is to be seen not in the figures of total production but in the shifting from charcoal to anthracite iron While the total product remained about the same the component  The ironmasters admitted that the act of 1846 had been sufficiently protective when first passed But in 1849 and 1850 they began to complain and ask for higher duties See Proceedings of Iron Convention at Pittsburg 1849 p 9 Proceedings of Convention at Albany pp 27 42 They certainly had a legitimate subject for complaint in the operation of the ad valorem duty in that it tended to exaggerate the fluctuations of prices When prices abroad were high the duty was high when prices abroad were low the duty was low Consequently the price of foreign iron in the United States which is the sum of the foreign price and the duty fluctuated more widely than the foreign price alone This was certainly an evil especially with an article whose price was liable under any conditions to vary so much as the price of iron See the table p 325THE TARIFF 18301860 331 elements changed greatly The production of anthracite iron rose steadily that of charcoal iron fell as steadily The first

ECONOMICS at least should disappear was inevitable Charcoal iron for general use was a thing of the past and the effect of the tariff of 1842 was to call into existence a number of furnaces which used antiquated methods and before long must have been displaced in any event by anthracite fur naces The use of anthracite not only stimulated the produc tion of pig iron but also that of rolled iron and railroad bars Anthracite was first used in puddling and reheat ing in 1844 and 1845 and thenceforward rolled iron was made regularly in large quantities In 1856 the produc tion of rolled iron was nearly 500000 tonst Iron rails first began to be made while the tariff act of 1842 was in force though the steps towards making them were taken even before that act put an end to the free admission of English railst With the decline in railroad building and the general fall in iron prices which took place in 1849 many of the rail mills stopped work But the business revived with the general prosperity which set in early in the decade and the production of rails steadily increased until 1856 Under the influence of the crisis of 1857 it fell but soon rose again and in 1860 was more than

use The first step towards a vigorous and healthy growth of the iron industry was in the use of anthracite in 1840 That step so far from being pro moted by the high duties was taken in a time when duties were on the point of being reduced to the 20 per cent level Hardly had it been taken when the high duties of the tariff act of 1842 brought about not indeed alone but in conjunction with other causes a temporary return to the old charcoal process A number of new charcoal furnaces were built unsuited to the industry of the time and certain to succumb before long Under the lower duties from 1846 to 1860 the charcoal production gradu ally became a less and less important part of the iron industry and before the end of the period had been re stricted to those limits within which it could find a perma nent market for the special qualities of its iron On the other hand the lower duties did not prevent a steady growth in the making of anthracite iron while the pro duction of railroad iron arid of rolled iron in general also made possible by the use of anthracite showed a similar steady progress There is no reason to doubt that had there been no duty at all there would yet have been a large production of anthracite pig and rolled iron Mean while the country was rapidly developing and needed much iron The low duties permitted a large importation of foreign iron in addition to a large domestic production The comparative cheapness and abundance of so impor tant an industrial agent could not have operated other wise than to promote material prosperity  Charcoal iron has qualities which cause a certain quantity of it to be in demand under any circumstances Since it settled down about 1860 to its normal place as a supplement to coalmade iron the product has steadily increased with the growing needs of the country In the years 186365 the annual product was about 240000 tons In 1886 it was 460000 tons334 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS We turn now to another industry the manufacture of cotton goods by far the largest and most important branch of the textile industry Here we are met at the outset by the fact that at the beginning of the period which we are considering the cotton manufacture was in the main inde pendent of protection and not likely to be much affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in duties Probably as early as 1824 and almost certainly by 1832 the indus try had reached a firm position in which it was able to meet foreign competition on equal terms Mr Nathan Appleton who was a large owner of cotton factory stocks and certainly a good judge and who was also one of the ablest and most prominent advocates of protective duties said in 1833 that at that date coarse cottons could not have been imported from England if there had been no duty at all and that even on many grades of finer goods competition was little to be feared In regard to prints the American goods were quality for quality as cheap as the English but might be supplanted in the absence of duties by the poorer and nominally cheaper English goods an argument often heard in our own day which obviously puts the protective system on the ground of regulating the quality of goods for consumers The general situation of the cotton manufacture as described by Appleton was one in which duties had ceased to be a factor of much importance in its developments During the extraordinary fluctuations of industry and the gradual reduction of duties which ensued under the compromise tariff of 1833 the cotton manufacture was profitable and expanded or encountered depression and loss in sympathy with the industry of the country at large being influenced chiefly by the expansion of credit and the rise of prices before 1837 and 1839 and the crisis

duty under the Compromise Act large investments were made in the business in the earlier part of the period Thus in 183536 the Amoskeag Company began on a large scale its operations in Manches ter New Hampshire The depression at the close of the decade checked growth for a while but did not prevent new investments from being made even before the passage of the act of 1842 settled the tariff

they made no mention of duties or of tariff4t Appletons account of the stage reached by the industry finds confirmation in a careful volume on the cotton manufacture in the United States published in 1840 by Robert Montgomery This writers general con clusions are much the same as those which competent observers reach for our own time Money wages were about twice as high in the United States but the prod uct per spindle and per loom was considerably greater The cotton in his time was not so well mixed not so thoroughly cleaned not so well carded in the United States as in England but on the

Americans in exporting cottons to greater honesty in manufacturing and to the superior quality of their goods During the years following the passage of the act of 1842 by which the duties on cottons were increased largely the manufacturers made high profits In Secre tary Walkers Report and in other attacks on protective duties much was made of this circumstance the high profits being ascribed to

profitable More over the price of raw cotton was low in these years lag ging behind the advance in the price of cotton goods and as long as this lasted the manufacturers made large gains The fact that prosperity was shared by the cotton manufacturers in England shows that other causes than the new tariff must have been at work On the other hand when the act of 1846 was passed the protectionists predicted disaster  but disaster came not either for the country at large or for the cotton in dustry Throughout the period from 1846 to 1860 the manufacture of cottons grew steadily affected by the gen eral conditions of trade but little influenced by the lower duties Exact figures indicating its fortunes are not to be had yet we have enough information to enable us to judge of the general trend of events The number of spindles in use gives the best indication of the growth of cotton manufacturing We have no trustworthy figures as to the number of spindles in the whole country but we have figures collected by a competent and wellinformed writer in regard to Massachusetts That State has always been the chief seat of the cotton manufacture and its progress there doubtless indicates what took place in the country at large The number of spindles in Massachu setts which was in round numbers 340000 in 1831 had nearly doubled in 1840 was over 800000 in 1845 and was over 1600000 in 1860

Report to the338 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS compiled independently reach the same general result Between the first half of the decade 184050 and the second half of the decade 185060 the quantity of raw cotton used in the mills of the United States about doubled The annual consumption which had been about 150000 bales in 1830 rose to an average of more than 300000 bales in the early years of the next decade and again to one of more than 600000 bales in the years 185054 In the five years immediately preceding the civil war the average annual consumption was about 800000 bales During these years the consumption of cotton in Great Britain seems to have increased at very nearly the same rate Such figures indicate that the cotton manufacture was advancing rapidly and steadily Another sign of its firm position is the steady increase during the same period in the exports of cotton goods chiefly to China and the East The value of the cotton goods exported averaged but little over 3000000

was confined mainly to the production of plain cheap staple cotton cloths and was not extended to the making of finer and fancy  goods But even under the high protective duties of the last twentyfive years the bulk of the product has continued to be of the first mentioned kind and cottons of that grade have been sold quality for quality at prices not above those of foreign goods while comparatively little progress has been made in the manu facture of the finer grades The situation of the woollen manufacture differs in some important respects from that of the cotton manufacture most noticeably in that it is less favorable as regards the supply of raw material The maker of cotton goods is sure of securing at home cotton of the best quality at a price below that which his foreign rival must pay But many qualities of wool cannot be produced to advantage in the United States while others cannot be grown at all or at least notwithstanding very heavy protective duties have not been grown in fact Moreover the raw material  Batchelder who was a decided advocate of protection wrote in 1861 a series of articles for the Boston Commercial Advertiser in which after compar ing the prices and qualities of English and American shirtings he said  The inquiry may then be made What occasion is there for a protective duty  The answer is There would be none in the ordinary course of business But there are sometimes occasions when  there has been a great accumulation of goods in the hands of manufacturers abroad so that if crowded on their market it would depress the price of the usual supply of their customers at home On such occasions our warehouse system affords the opportunity at little expense to send the goods here where they may be ready to be thrown on the market to be sold etc In Ellisons Handboolc of the Cotton Trade 1858 it is said at p 29  It is believed that had it not been for the freetrade policy of Great Britain the manufacturing system of America would at the present time have been much more extensive than it is but the spinners and manufacturers of Lancashire can as yet successfully compete with those of Lowell though for how long a time remains to be seen for the latter are yearly gaining experience and improving their machinery so that before long they will be able to compete with the old country more especially should the executive sic abolish the present protective system adopted with respect to the import of cotton manu factures340 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS when obtained is neither so uniform in quality nor so well adapted to treatment by machinery as is the fibre of cotton Wool is of the most diverse quality varying from a fine silklike fibre to a coarse hairy one A process of careful sorting by hand must therefore be gone through before manufacture can begin In some branches of the industry the qualities of the fibre and those of the goods which are to be made from it call for more of manual labor and admit in less degree of the use of machinery than is the case with cottons and it is a familiar fact though one of which the true meaning has not often been grasped that a need of resorting to direct manual labor in large proportion and a difficulty in substituting machin ery constitute under conditions of freedom an obstacle to the profitable prosecution of an industry in the United States But on the other hand certain qualities of wool are grown to advantage in the climate of this country and under its industrial conditions especially strong merino wools of good though not fine grade of comparatively short staple adapted for the making of flannels blankets and substantial cloths At the same time machinery can be applied to making these fabrics with less difficulty than to the manufacture of some finer goods Our information in regard to the history of the woollen manufacture is even more defective than that on iron and cottons For the period between 1830 and 1840 we have no information that is worth anything In 1840 the industry was confined to making satinets a substan tial inexpensive cloth ilot of fine quality broadeloths flannels and blanketst The tariff act of 1842 imposed on woollen goods a duty of 40 per cent and on wool one of three cents a pound plus 30 per cent on the value It is said that during the four years in which these I reserve for another occasion

ad valorem duty on wool The act however did not remain in force long enough to make it clear what would have been its permanent effect on the woollen manufacture Whatever may have been the start made in these few years in making finer woollens this branch of the industry as is generally admitted wellnigh disappeared under the duties of 1846 The act of that year imposed a duty of 30 per cent on woollen goods in general but flannels and worsteds were admitted at 25 per cent and blankets at 20 per cent On wool also the duty was 30 per cent Under this arrangement of duties  whether or not in consequence of it no develop ment took place in those branches of the manufacture which needed wool that was subject to the 30 per cent duty The finest grades of woollens were not made at all But the manufacture of cloths of ordinary quality socalled cassimeres and similar goods and that of blan kets and flannels continued to show a regular growth The census figures are not of much value as accurate sta tistics but there seems no reason for doubting that they prove a steady advance in the woollen manufacture as a wholet The growth was confined mainly to those branches which used domestic wool but within these there was not only increase but development The methods of manufacture were improved better machinery was introduced and new kinds of goods were mladef It Grosvenor Does

of which most of the laboring people and all the boys are supplied with woollen gar ments The manufacture of flannels blankets and ordi nary knit goods  pure necessaries of life  occupies most of the other mills engaged in working up carded wool  Some outlying branches of the woollen manufacture however showed a striking advance during the period we are considering The most noteworthy of these is the carpet manufacture which received a great impetus from their beautiful colorings as well as star twills halfdiamonds Up to that time fancy cassimeres had been made largely through the Blackstone Valley in Rhode Island on the Crompton and Tappet looms as made by William Crompton As early as 1846 the Jacquard was used at Woonsocket and Blackstone From 1850 to 1860 fancy cassimeres made a rapid advance and the styles ran to extremes far more than they have ever since Wades Fibre and Fabric as quoted above p xlviii According to the official Statistical Information relating to Certain Branches

the more complicated loom for weaving Brussels carpets was first perfected by the same inventive genius in 1848 The new machinery at once put the manufacture of carpets on a firm basis and in its most important branches the manufacture of ingrain and Brussels carpets it became independent of aid from protective duties A similar development took place in the manufacture of woollen hose The knitting Irame had been invented in England as early as the sixteenth century but had been worked only by hand It was first adapted to machinery in the United States in 1831 and was first worked by machinery at Cohoes in New York in 1832 Other inventions followed and a prosperous in dustry developed which supplied the entire domestic market and was independent of protective dutiest On the other hand hardly more than a beginning was made before the Civil War in the manufacture of worsted goods In 1860 there were no more than three considerable factories engaged in making worsteds and the imports largely exceeded the domestic productt Some explana tion of this state of things may be found in the compara tively low duty of 25 per cent which worsteds paid under the tariff of 1846 Something was also due to the fact that the worsted industry in England not only was long established but was steadily improving its methods and through French importations The vast carpet manufacture of Philadelphia larger than in any city of Europe has its chief occupation in furnishing carpets for the more modest houses  See the sketch of Mr Bigelows career up to 1854 in Hunts Merchants Magazine As

Protection a Boon to Consumers Boston 1867 pp 911 No attempt had been made before 1860 in the United States or elsewhere to make knit goods of cotton t See the Introduction to the volume on Manufactures Census of 1860 pp xxxvixxxix From the figures of production in the Census of 1860 and from those of344 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS machinery But the most important cause doubtless was the duty of 30 per cent on the long staple comb ing wool which then was needed for making worsted goods and which physical causes have prevented from being grown to any large extent in the United States The greatest difference between the woollen industry as it stands today and as it stood before 1860 is in the large worsted manufacture of the present which has grown up almost entirely since the wool and woollens act of 1867 The high duties undoubtedly have been a cause of this development or at least were so in the beginning but a further and important cause has been the great improvement in combing machinery which has rendered it possible to make socalled worsted goods from almost any grade of wool and has largely done away the dis tinction between woollen and worsted goods The re sult has been that the worsted makers as well as the makers of woollens have been able to use domestic wool and it is in the production of goods made of such wool that the greatest growth of recent years has taken place The tariff act of 1857 reduced the duty on woollens to 24 per cent but much more than made up for this by admitting wool practically free of duty Wool costing less than twenty cents at the place of exportation was admitted free which amounted in effect to the exemption of almost all wool from duty Moreover dyestuffs and other materials were admitted free or at low rates The free admission of wool from Canada under the reciprocity treaty of 1854 bad already been in force for three years imports in the Report on Commerce and Navigation for the fiscal year 185960

reciprocity treaty and were used in making worsteds and carpets In 1866 when the treaty was terminated and high duties had been imposed on wool inTHE TARIFF 18301860 345 As might have been expected these changes served to stimulate the industry and it grew and prospered during the years immediately preceding the Civil War A remis sion of duty on materials obviously operates mainly to the advantage of producers and middlemen in the first in stance and brings benefit to consumers only by a process more or less gradual The experiment of free wool with a moderate duty on woollens was not tried long enough to make certain what would be its final results But it seems to have had little if any effect on the prices of domestic wool it gave a distinct stimulus to the woollen manufacture and it must have tended at the least to cheapen for the consumer goods made in whole or in part of foreign wool It would be possible to extend this inquiry farther but enough has been said for the present purpose In the main the change in duties has had much less effect on the protected industries than is generally supposed Their growth has been steady and continuous and seems to have been little stimulated by the high duties of 1842 and little checked by the more moderate duties of 1846 general the manufacturers pleaded hard for the continued free admission of Canada wool though they were active in securing the general high duties of 1867 on wool and woollens But they did not succeed in getting the Canada wools free See the Statement of Facts relative to Canada Wools and the Manu

about the same t In the Introduction to the volume on Manufactures of the Census of 1860 to which reference has been made before there is a useful sketch of the history of various branches of manufacture up to that date346 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS and 1857 Probably the duties of the lastmentioned years while on their face protective duties did not have in any important degree the effect of stimulating indus tries that could not have maintained themselves under freedom of trade They did not operate as strictly pro tective duties and did not bring that extra tax on con sumers which is the peculiar effect of protective duties The only industry which presents a marked exception to these general conditions is the manufacture of the cruder forms of iron In that industry the conditions of pro duction in the eastern part of the United States were such that the protective duties of 1842 caused a return to old processes and an enhanced price to the country with out a corresponding gain to producers Even under the rates of 1846 and after the use of anthracite coal the same effect can be seen though in less degree The present situation is not so different as is generally supposed from that which existed before 1860 The man ufacture of crude iron in the eastern part of the United States now presents in some degree a case of the effect of a pure protective duty But at present as before 1860 the great textile manufactures are not dependent in any considerable degree on protective duties and the produc tion of crude iron would not be more likely now than then to disappear entirely under moderate duties No doubt the growth of manufacturing industries has been greatly stimulated by the high duties which have been maintained since the civil war and in some cases stimu lated beyond the point at which they could maintain themselves without some degree of protection But ex perielnce under the more moderate duties of the earlier period indicates that a steady growth would have taken place in any event Some branches of manufactures may be dependent on the present high duties but the bulk of them probably would have reached something like their present position under a much more moderate system F W TAUSSIG

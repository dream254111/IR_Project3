purpose of this discussion to direct attention to a single phase of the problem of sex hygiene the adequate training for teachers who are to give the instruction The importance of such training is obvious when one considers that the character of ones knowledge and the conditions under which it has been attained largely determine his emotional reaction to a situation and the discernment of individual needs while largely a matter of tact and insight also depends in great measure upon a broad and sure knowledge of the facts involved in the type of situation con fronting us Hence the valuable thing for educators seems to be a restatement of the aims of sexual education and the study of the available materials and methods by which those who are directly or indirectly responsible for sex instructionwhether parents teach ers administrators or religious and social workerscan attain a due preparedness to achieve these ends The positive aims of sexual education on its more elemental side are physical and biological They look toward sound physique and function normal marriage and a reasonable number of healthy offspring These are cardinal and we do right to direct primary attention to them But it is as great a mistake to suppose that they express the whole of sexual education as to assume that preparation to earn a living is the whole of education in general Primary sexual functioning in man even more than in the lower animals normally falls into a comparatively inconspicuous place among his lifeactivities On the other hand the range of second ary sexual activity has been immensely increased in man and has tinged many other phases of life with such numerous and varied colors that we cannot ignore sex if we would It is absurd to suppose that these are not fit subjects for the attention of education since they so profoundly affect life We do not hesitate to assign 249THE SCHOOL REVIEW as a part of the aims of sexual education that the youth shall learn the graces of social life in relation to sex that fashion shall be sane and refined in its expression of the sex instinct that the sexual element in recreation shall be spontaneous without excess or morbidity that a sexual selection which makes for individual happiness and racial wellbeing shall be exercised under the pro tection of a trained capacity for the judgment of sexual charms that the erethic glow of art and religion shall find a due apprecia tion drawing warmth from sex and imparting control to it and that the finer graces and essential chivalry of ethics shall find a congenial soil In the face of these positive aims we cannot but see the purely incidental nature of the negative propaganda which has hitherto dominated There is need of prophylactic teaching of course Unhygienic and vicious habits must be prevented Premature and violent sexual stimulation must be avoided The association of the obscene with sex must be forestalled Inhibitions of modesty and chastity must be imposed upon the sexual impulse but it cannot be too strongly emphasized that these inhibitions as heretofore imparted to girls have often been of a perniciously indiscriminate nature What we are advocating as sexual education is a far larger thing than teaching the avoidance of certain vices It is a thing of rich emotional and cultural possibilities and must be approached from many angles with as large and comprehensive and constructive an ideal as possible So far as explicit school courses are concerned we do well to leave it an integral part of biology or physiology provided only that this refusal of a special place to it be not con strued into a tacit admission of its unimportance or impropriety resulting in its total neglect In the studies named the tendency is steadily in the direction of a careful scientific training for the teacher But it often happens that such instruction is needed in schools where there is no trained biologist that the ruralschool teacher the minister and above all the parent finds an occasion when there is need for individual advice or instruction for which he feels his inadequacy that the principal or superintendent has to judge of the fitness of material method or teacher for formal sex 250READING FOR TEACHERS OF SEX HYGIENE instruction or that a firm and sure knowledge of sex problems is required of some man as a leader in the community irrespective of his professional function It is such situations that require a sane and constructive and unshrinking concept of sex which cannot be made to order For the benefit of those who may face these problems we venture to suggest a series of studies which we think will serve the double purpose of leading the student of them into an adequate view of sex and of aiding in the evaluation of the immense mass of literature from which these titles are selected The mature and educated person who has not studied the sub ject at all will perhaps require to be awakened to the need of sexual education A large part of the periodical literature of sex has had this purpose It would be too much to say that this literature is unduly an alarmist but at least it is likely to convey an excessive emphasis on the pathological side shockingly prevalent as that is Some typical titles are Addams Jane A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil McClures XXXVIII 23240 This is one of a series all valuable Henderson Charles Richmond Education with Reference to Sex Eighth Yearbook of the National Society for the Scientific Study of Education The University of Chicago Press I909 Pp 7489 Morrow Prince A Social Diseases and Marriage New York Lea Bros  Co I904 This material soundly scientific as it is must be regarded as inadequate just in proportion to its ease of acquisition It merely directs attention to the field and is entirely useless unless followed up with a constructive type of knowledge For the child the real foundation for sexual education is not to be found in any printed literature but in the habit of regarding organic nature as one great realm of genesis and growth none of whose secrets is necessarily locked to him This attitude can be imparted to any child in the grades by the teaching of elementary biological facts frankly and without the prudish exclusion of human reproductive processes which too generally mars such teaching Training of this kind will at least give a point of view to which leaders of public thought can afterward appeal when these children need specific sex instruction or themselves become parents and are confronted with the problem of instructing their own 25ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW children Material of this kind is discussed in the following literature Eddy Walter H An Experiment in Teaching Sex Hygiene

speak from adequate knowl edge must know not only pathological conditions and have the normal biological attitude toward sex The specifically human physiology of sex and reproduction should be studied

FOR TEACHERS OF SEX HYGIENE were stressed while the part of bisexuality in organic life and in human society was not explicitly studied To this training then should be added a study of the important biological and anthropo logical aspects of sex such as are to be found in the following Darwin Charles The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex New York Appleton I887 Pp 688 Ellis Havelock

Press 3 vols Westermarck A History of Human Marriage Westermarck The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas This stage of sex study which may be regarded as the substance of that required by the college man or woman should not be regarded as complete without some knowledge of the specifically psychological problems of sex Those who are familiar with general psychology will find their point of departure in the place of instinct and emotion in human activity as discussed by James Principles of Psychology chaps xxiv and xxv Dewey A Theory of Emotion Psy Rev I 55369 II 1332 Ribot The Psychology of the Emotions New York Scribner and McDougall Social Psychology Boston Luce  Co The theory of emotion is well summarized by Angell Psychology chaps xviii and xix In English the best special treatments of sexual psychology at this level are the following Bell Sanford A Preliminary Study of the Emotion of Love between the Sexes Amer Jour of Psy XIII 32554 Scott Colin A Sex and Art Amer Jour of Psy VII 153226 The lastnamed is particularly full and illuminating There would seem to be a gap in sex literature at this point calling for a single volume of moderate size dealing with the psychology of sex and summarizing the valid and important conclusions of these and of more elaborate studies to be mentioned presently It does not appear either that the significant phenomena recorded by Bell on the question of socalled romantic love have attracted the further investigation which they deserve No phenomena of human psychology are of greater value and significance for the emotional life of the individual and few touch more closely the fundamental 253THE SCHOOL REVIEW bonds of society and yet none has received less intelligent treat ment at the hands even of those scientists who have deigned to notice them at all The question deserves a critical study to ascertain the meaning of love in terms of biology and anthropology and to free it from the vaporings of an overdone romanticism The teacher who has to deal largely with the matter will need to be familiar also with the general views of the sex problem arising out of the large experience of eminent physicians and scholars Three such have come to us from the German one is English They are Bloch Ivan The Sexual Life of Our Times Ellis Havelock Studies in the Psychology of Sex Vol VI cited below Forel A The Sexual Question New York Rebman Co I908 Pp xv536 Moll Albert The Sexual Life of the Child New York Macmillan 1912 Pp xv339 i75 The writer has not had the privilege of seeing Blochs work Forels is a standard Moll has dealt with a most important phase of the problem in a way which is invaluable to the teacher if he possesses the larger view of sex to which the course of reading here suggested is intended to lead Before undertaking any of these volumes the student should be sure that he can assimilate the pathological sources which they use At this stage of study the teacher should be prepared to evaluate independently the flood of books intended to convey sex instruction for the untrained Generally speaking these books are makeshifts The best of them are of the class issued by the American Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis There are a number of books for young people which are reasonably free from objection such as the following Educational Pamphlets of the American Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophy laxis New York Lea Bros  Co No i The Young Man Problem No 2 Instruction in the Physiology and Psychology of Sex For teachers No 3 The Relations of

Hygiene Jour of Ed Psy II 46470 The objection to the literature criticized in the last four titles is that it singles out sex and centers attention upon it The true attitude is summed up admirably by Parkinson A wholesome view of sex makes it an integral part of life so that specific instruc tion need not come with an air of constraint The last volume of Ellis great work has already been cited as in the same class with those of Bloch Forel and Moll As a whole however we may cite it as constituting the next higher phase of the subject namely the exhaustive study of the entire problem from the sources It is a work beyond the needs of the ordinary teacher and attains a minuteness of analysis that is only excelled in the monographs which deal at first hand with the specialists phases of the subject Ellis work is Ellis Havelock Studies in the Psychology of Sex Philadelphia F A Davis  Co 6 vols In conclusion we may be permitted to say from personal experi ence that sex instruction is neither so easy as some enthusiasts would have us believe nor so impossible as would appear to the apprehensive conventionality of those whose lips have always been sealed to the subject It should not be attempted except in emergency without a definite and sure knowledge beyond that which is to be imparted This knowledge in our opinion need not be that of the biological specialist but only the acquaintance which every educated person is presumed to have with the fundamentals of biology 255

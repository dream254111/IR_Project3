8fc Communicated by Major LUDLOW BEAMISH FRS Received February 8Read March 15 1849 Preliminary Remarks IN the first part of these researches I have endeavoured by generalizing the hypothesis on which is usually founded the theory of the earths figure not only to improve that theory but also to establish a secure basis for researches into the changes which may have taken place within and at the surface of the earth during the epochs of its geological history Although I stated that no precise physical evidence could be adduced for the examination of the assumption that the molecules of the primitive fluid supposed to have constituted thle earth retained their positions aftetr solidifica tion it yet appears that such evidence exists if we may be permitted to draw any conclusions relative to the physical properties of substances in the earths interior from the observed physical properties of substances at its surface Professor BISCHOF of Bonn has shown that Granite contracts in volume in passing from the fluid to the solid crystalline state from 1 to 7481 Trachyte from 1 to 8187 and Basalt from 1 to 8960 The first of these rocks appears as far as can be observed to con stitute the greater part of the earth  hence the assumption alluded to must be con sidered not only as superfluous but as erroneous In this Part it is my object to discover relations between the interior structure of the earth and phenomena observed at its surface and also the effects of the reaction of the fluid nucleus described in Article 6 Part I upon the solid crust I divide this Part into sections each containing a distinct investigation the order of arrange ment of these sections being determined according to their fundatnental importance The statement of the geological results capable of being deduced fromn these investi gations is for greater clearness reserved for the end Such of thtese results as chiefly depend on the validity of the reasonings used in Section III are presented with some diffidence owing to the imperfect experimental knowledge we possess respecting the subjects discussed in that section The diminution of the earths mean radius by refri geration is neglected all through except where the contrary is specially mentioned I THE PRESSURES OF THE SHELL AND NUCLEUS AT THEIR SURFACE OF CONTACT 1 In this investigation the earth is supposed to consist of a nucleus of fluid matter inclosed in a solid shell The inner and outer surfaces of the shell are sup  LEONHARD und BRONNS Neues Jahrbuch 1841 p 565 See also a paper by the same writer in the N Jahrbuch for 1843 p 1 These results seem also to be confirmed by others subsequently found by M DEVILLE 3 2MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS posed to be spheroidal oblate and nearly spherical Both shell and nucleus are supposed to be formed of strata increasing in density according to unknown laws as the radii of these strata decrease If the earth were solid from its surface to its centre all the phenomena of its rota tion could be determined by the integration of three differential equations relative to its motion about its centre of gravity and of three more relative to the motions of its principal axes referred to three rectangular axes fixed in space The constants contained in these equations would depend on the attractions of exterior bodies on the impressed forces and on the arrangement of the particles composing the earth It is evident that similar equations would suffice for the case of an empty shell con stituted in the manner above mentioned after the substitution of the constants depending on the magnitude and internal constitution of the shell for those depend ing on the magnitude and internal constitution of the entirely solid spheroid By adopting this method no new analytical transformations are required in discovering the phenomena of the shells independent rotation for we can thus avail ourselves of the researches already made by geometers relative to the rotation of the entirely solid spheroid I have therefore thought it sufficient for our present purposes to mnerely present the following conclusions to which I have arrived by using the method above indicated 1st If the original impressed forces were the same in direction and intensity for the shell asfor the entirely solid spheroid the angular velocity of the former about its instantaneous axis would be greater than the angular velocity of tile latter about its instantaneous axis 2nd The influence of exterior disturbing forces would be insensible relative to the rotation of the shell about its centre provided that its strata possess nearly similar laws of arrangement with those of the solid spheroid 3rd The motions in space of the axes of the shell due to the action of exterior disturbing bodies would be affected to a greater degree than similar motions of the axes of the solid spheroid If no other forces acted on the fluid nucleus besides the attractions of its own particles the attraction of the shell and centrifugal force its surface would be an ellipsoid of revolution and it would rotate steadily about the axis of its greatest mo ment of inertia If tie action of exterior disturbing bodies be added to these forces tidal oscillations in the surface of the nucleus would tend to be produced but it is evident that unless the disturbing forces were very great the position in space of the axis of rotation of the mass would be much less affected than if it existed in the solid state Let in addition to the forces already enumerated as acting on the fluid nucleus certain molecular forces be conceived to act on its particles by which the whole mass might in general acquire a tendency to expand or contract and also to change its form This class of forces may be conceived to be resolved into two pressurles acting at the inner surface of the shell one of them being supposed to be constant for every point and the other variable If moreover the constitution of the shell 512MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS and nucleus should be favourable to a great amount of friction at their surface of contact it is at least possible to conceive that if the sum of the pressures existing at the same surface be sufficiently great the whole mass might rotate nearly as if solid from its surface to its centre As it will hereafter appear that such conditions must almost necessarily exist it is superfluous for our present object to fuirther examine the general problem of the rotation of the shell and nucleus I shall therefore proceed to consider the pressures which might take place at the surface of contact of the shell and nucleus 2 Abstracting the action of exterior disturbing bodies the pressure of the nucleus at the inner surface of the shell will result from the attractions of all the particles of the shell and nucleus centrifugal force and molecular actions Unless the last mentioned class of forces should have a tendency to disturb the position of the axes of rotation of the shell and nucleus it is plain that these axes may be considered as coincident Of the two resultant pressures mentioned in the preceding article it is evident that the variable pressure may be conceived to result from the difference in form of the free surface of the nucleus and the shells inner surface If these surfaces be very nearly spheroids of revolution described about the shells axis of rotation it follows that the greatest pressure will be at the equator or poles of the shell according as the tendency of the nucleus may be to become more or less oblate In either case it is evident that every point on certain lines situated between the equator and poles will not be subjected to any pressure from this cause or in other words the sum of all the pressures at the points in question will be equal to the constant pressure The general expression for the pressure at any point of the shell may therefore be made to contain the coordinates of the lines in question as constant quantities As these lines in the case considered are evidently circles parallel to the equator of the shell we may call them the parallels of mean pressure Let a straight and indefinitely narrow canal of fluid be conceived to reach firom the centre to the surface of the nucleus Let the origin of the coordinates of any point in it be fixed at the centre of gravity of the mass and let the plane of x y be perpendicular to the axis of rotation Let r represent the radius drawn from the origin to a molecule in the canal a the angle made by this radius with the axis of rotation and w the angle formed by the projection of the radius on the plane of r y with the axis of y then zr cos 0 yr sin d cos  xr sin 0 sinW The pressure p at the point in the canal having these coordinates will be expressed by the equation dpXdxYdyZd z2xdxydy in which as in art 2 Part I X Y Z represent the components of the attractions parallel to the three rectangular axes of x y and z a the angular velocity of rota 613MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS tion of the nucleus and g the density at the point in the canal This equation may be written as

by combining the foregoing expressions and neglecting the difference between r and r PI 2 a sin20sin2l J rdr  1 For the pressure P at the shells inner surface we shall have P1  a2 o sin2 0 sin 20 rdr  2 r and Hi representing respectively the radius and pressure at the surface stratum of the nucleus If HI be not negative this expression will be always positive with respect to some portion of the shells inner surface for when a 7  the greatest pressure is at the equator and 0 7 01 when a a the greatest pressure is at the poles and consequently 0 Z 0l 3 The determination of 0 may be thus easily effected Let the equations of the generating ellipses of the surfaces of the nucleus and shell be respectively A2 A2B 2Z2A2B2 A2zx2 B2 z2A 2B A1 B1 and A2 B representing respectively the less and greater axes of these surfaces The volumes contained within these surfaces being equal we have AlB A2B2 and hence at the parallels of mean pressure where xx and z Z AA  B 2  y B2A2B21A 514MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS This expression shows that the parallels of mean pressure are symmetrically situated at each side of the equator If for z its value be substituted and the condition of equality of volumes be re membered we shall obtain A cos  VAAA  3 r1 being supposed to differ very little from A If the changes in the oblateness of the nucleus be small cos 0 will be nearly con stant and the parallels of mean pressure will oscillate but slightly about their mean position Hence if A2A1 s s will be a very small quantity depending on the difference of the ellipticities of the two surfaces but by TAYLORS theorem FAFA FA  2FA Hence if the surface of the shell should change with every change of form of the nucleus s will be infinitely small and consequently cos  4 If the surface of the shell should not change its form for every change in form of the nucleus s might yet be so small as to be negligible compared with other quanti ties entering into our analytical expressions and hence in such a case the above ex pression for 01 will be approximately true As 0 is the complement of the latitude at the parallel of mean pressure we may conclude fiom the preceding investigation that at the parallel the square of the sine of the latitude of which is onethird the pressure of the fluid is always the same as if the surface of the nucleus were one of equal pressure for the shell Hence if we represent byf the centrifilgal force at the equator of the shells outer surface where the radius is supposed equal to unity and byf its value corresponding to a equation 1 becomes PIf cos2D e  d  5 where a represents the radius of a sphere equal in volume to the spheroid included within the stratum of the nucleus with the radius r and which consequently differs but little from r The simple expressions for the pressure on any stratum of the nucleus and on the shells inner surface obtained in this section will be found useful in the course of these researches and particularly in the succeeding section II THE VARIATION OF GRAVITY AT THE EARTHS SURFACE 4 It is in general evident that if the laws of arrangement of the molecules cotii posing the shell and nucleus be different the variation of gravity at the surface of 515MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS the former will not be the same as if in solidifying all the particles retained the same positions which they had when constituting the entirely fluid mass All investiga tions heretofore made of the variation of gravity at the earths surface being grounded on this very untenable hypothesis it seems desirable that a more general solution of the question should be obtained in which such a supposition would not be involved The forces acting on a particle at the shells outer surface which we have here to examine arelst the shells attraction 2nd the attraction of the nucleus 3rd centrifugal force If the laws of arrangement of the matter composing the shell be continuous the first of these forces will be equal to the difference between the attraction of the entirely solid spheroid and that of the spheroid produced by the complete solidification of the nucleus the particles in both spheroids arranging them selves according to the influence of the forces acting on them 5 Attraction of the ShellIn a spheroid differing but little from a sphere and com posed of homogeneous strata varying in form and density the expression upon which its attraction on an exterior point depends is thus written p47 a 47r pa a4 V rf 2a2da J g2da3Wo  3W c   6 the radius of each

LAPLACES coefficients g2 the density of any stratum a the value of a at the surface and r the radius of the attracted point If the above expression be supposed to refer to the spheroid included within the shells outer surface it is evident that a corresponding expression may be obtained for the spheroid included within the shells inner surface by merely changing 13 into i and a into al P being a constant depending on the ellipticity of that surface and a the value of a corresponding to it we shall have therefore 4r 4rr3 Lp I  a4 V1Wa2da et  7 VIrf2a2dar  If 6 and 7 be differentiated with

surfaces of both spheroids to be covered with a homogeneous fluid to a small depth compared with their radii The bounding surfaces of these fluid strata will depend on the attractions of the spheroids and also on the attractions of the fluid particles If the density of each of these strata be nearly the same as that  See PONTECOULANT Th6orie Analytique c Livre V No 23 516MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN

expression for the attraction of a homogeneous shell with surfaces of equal ellipticity is evidently GMl 5al  ale l a  cos2   15 6 Attraction of the NucleusThe forces acting on any stratum of the nucleus by changing the arrangement of its particles must in general influence their action on exterior bodies hence to obtain the attraction of the nucleus it is necessary to take all such forces into consideration These forces are in the present case the attractions and pressures of masses of fluid within and without the stratum the attraction of the shell and centrifugal force Hence for any stratum we have the following equation of equilibrium pdp24 a a3 4 a3  3 4 5 etc J P rJ0 da3 4Jr JOgdaYQaYlaY2 etc ai a ar y v r4 2a gda 247 gdYa2Y YY 2 etc at a 2r g2da24srg eda2Wo  arW  Wo etc  ifr2 fr2cos  3 where p represents the pressure at any point in the stratum YO YI c are functions of the coordinates satisfying the equation of LAPLACES coefficients and also possess ing the property of forming the terms of the series into which the radius of the point may be developed But as the nucleus is inclosed in a rigid shell its surface is constrained to take a form different from that which it would have if the shell were removed The in tegral at the left side of the above equation is consequently variable The condi tions of equilibrium require that it should be constant and these conditions may be fulfilled by separating the variable from the constant terms in that quantity and transposing the former terms to the right side the quantities YO Yi c being sup posed to undergo any variations which may be required by the new conditions By article 2 pIIff cos2 0f ada I being such a pressure that p I ff sin2 O gada O being that value of d which makes pII and p a function of a1 and consequently a constant for the nucleus 3x2 519520 MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS On developing ra1ly and substituting the value of p we obtain f4ni Iyf ylda3 da3  Y  l gda4Y j da5Y

being the ellipticity of the surface of the nucleus and consequently of the shells inner surface The general form of the function upon which depends the attraction of the nucleus on an exterior point may be found by substituting these values in 7 having first changed 2 into e and W0 WI c into YO Y c hence V3 l l r cos2 j  a fm i a a cos2  18 assuming that the mass of the nucleus is equal to the mass of the solid spheroid included within its surface having the same law of density asthe shell The truth of this assumption will appear more manifest further on 7 If in a similar manner we substitute the values of W2 c P1W2 c in 8 then develope r in both 8 and 18 after the differentiation of 18 we shall have the sum of the attractions of the nucleus and shell on a point at the shells outer surface by adding the resulting expressions If to this sum we add the term pro duced by the centrifugal force we shall have for G gravity at any point of the surface having 6 for the complement of its latitude the expression G  cos2    19 where Im23fa  pa lf  r mt 1 4ta aa2e3e2a   20 all terms of the second order being as usual neglected m standing for the value of m corresponding tof and G for gravity at the equator When the mass is supposed to be entirely fluid aa1 mm a  a 1 and consequently hme as should be expected The foregoing is the most general expression for the varia tion of gravity at the earths surface yet obtained gravity at any point being expressed 521MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS as a function of the latitude of that point of the radii and ellipticities of the shells inner and outer surfaces and of functions depending on the constitution of the shell and nucleus Its value is not merely speculative for it will be found to assist in ex plaining certain apparent anomalies detected by observation in the variation of gravity at the earths surface as well as in pointing out the limits assigned by obser vation to the thickness of the solid crust III THE LAWS OF DENSITY OF THE SHELL AND NUCLEUS 8 The density g of a stratum of the mass when entirely fluid has been shown in Part I to depend on the pressure to which it may be subjected and to the mole cular properties of the fluid The density of a stratum of the nucleus must evidently depend on the same circumstances and hence we may assume its expression to have the same general form as for the entirely fluid mass but yet containing variable indeterminate coefficients If the solidification of the nucleus proceeded entirely from its centre to its surface no shell could at any time exist and as it will appear that it could not simultaneously solidify both from its centre towards its surface and from its surface towards its centre we can here consider only the latter case When the solidification of the nucleus proceeds in this manner its superficial stratum in contact with thle inner surface of the shell will be the first to assume the solid state As solidification must proceed very slowly from the slowness of the refrigeration of the entire mass it is evident that the thickness of the stratum may be considered indefinitely small com pared with the radius of the nucleus Let its density in the fluid state be gi in the solid state  and let fk2 k being a function depending on the contraction of the fluid when solidifying If in conformity with the preceding remarks we assume c1 sin an1 c and n varying with a the mean radius of the nucleus we shall have to determine four quantities in order to arrive at a knowledge of the laws of density of the shell and nucleus It appears however that the number of known conditions which these quantities must satisfy will not suffice for their complete determination although it is possible to conceive hlow a new condition could be experimentally found by which the required number would be made up For if the physical properties of the matter composing the earths interior resemble those of the matter at its surface the form of k could be found with some degree of approximation by a series of experiments on the contraction of fused matter at different densities resulting from differences of pressure The conditions which can be at present determined are easily found thus If the law of density of the shell be continuous which must result from its mode of formation and if the variations of a and a from refrigeration be neglected we shall  Articles 6 and 7 3522MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS have a at a 4r g2a2da4  g2a2da  o a2da and consequently a2da f fa2da    21 n2 2

line to the surface of the nucleus and consequently to pass through the surface stratum having the thickness dal Conceive this stratum to con sist of an infinite number of elementary parallelopipeds having their bases resting against the shells inner surface As the oscillations of the shells surface are small the simultaneous contraction of all these paralielopipeds can take place only in a direction perpendicular to their bases and consequently dal will become klda k being the cubical contraction of a mass of the fluid composing the stratum The increase in volume of the shell by the addition of the new stratum will be less than the de crease in volume of the nucleus by its abstraction from its mass and hence the nucleus must tend to expand in order to fill the empty space which would otherwise exist This would evidently result as a necessary consequence of the cause of the variation in density of the strata from its centre to its surface The radius of the nucleus after the solidification of its superficial stratum being a  kda and it being manifest that the entire mass of the nucleus before the solidifi cation took place is equal to the mass of the solid stratum with the thickness kda and the mass of the new nucleus aIl alkda Ia2d a 0 2dal a2dka  a a2da1 or a i  al  k dal a g2a2dadg gga daO where g is the density of the stratum with the radius a after the

pansion of the stratum to which it refers we may write gfa gfac kda 523524 MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS c being indeterminate hence ckdalcka ada  12  consequently 23 becomes after substitution and differentiation with respect to a dg2 dg 21kj  dada a 24 neglecting terms of the second order and making c c If we assume sin a 1 2 C2 and n2 being constants and make q1 1 an cot aln

cot n2 n being the value of n at the surface of the entirely fluid mass and k the value of k determined by experiment at the surface under atmospheric pressure But firom 22 we have knq   27 n q  hence for the determination of n we obtain n2c 1 2  n  28 In obtaining these results some assumptions had to be made which in the absence of experimental data can be considered only provisional but it will be satisfactory to perceive that the results themselves seem to be in accordance with what we would expect from known physical laws When a0 qlO 3O0 and kl its greatest value k consequently increases as the thickness of the shell increases or as the density of the surface stratum of the nucleus increases But the cubical contraction is equal to the cubical dilatation of the mass if reduced again to the fluid state under the same pressure and by a recognized physical principle the dilatation of a body is equal to its resistance to compression or inversely proportional to its compressibility But the compressibility of a stratum of the nucleus decreases as its density increases hence the above result appears to be in conformity with an observed physical lawMR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS Equation 28 may be thus written mcr  al2n1          29 mc       an29 mI makingn from which it is evident that m decreases with a and consequently that the less the volume of the nucleus the more does it approach the state of homo geneity 10 If any grounds existed for believing that experiment could never even ap proximately disclose the laws of density and contraction of the matter composing the earths interior we should not be justified in attaching much importance to any hy pothesis however plausible which may be formed relative to the forms of these laws Such grounds would partially exist as long as doubts could be formed relative to the great or small specific density of the matter of the earths interior The variation in density of the spheroidal strata composing the earth could be due to an accumulation near its centre of substances possessing a high specific density From what we know of the matter composing the earth I believe that almost all substances having a density much greater than that of the outer portion of its crust are metals bodies which from their chemical nature do not probably exist to any great extent within the globe Recent experiments tend to show that many metals are but com pound radicals which exist only under certain conditions and it is probable that the constituents of any one of these radicals have densities less than that of the metal itself KANE LAURENT and GERHARDT are of opinion for instance that the known metals do not exist in their oxides but are eliminated when the oxides are decom posed The metals alluded to are also simple bodies in the sense generally used namely that of being the lowest terms as yet known of compound bodies Recent chemical researches seem to show that such simple bodies existed in the earths pri mitive state even in less quantity than we can at present discover them The chemical laws in virtue of which this would be true would under certain conditions act as well in the interior as at the earths surface if we are entitled at all to admit their generality and hence we must conclude that the specific density of the sub stances in the earths interior must be subordinate to the effects of mechanical and physical causes in producing the observed variation in the density of its strata IV THE FORMS OF THE STRATA OF THE SHELL 11 As every stratum of the shell was originally the surface stratum of the fluid nucleus its form must depend on that of the shells inner surface and of the iso thermal surfaces passing through its poles and equator At first I shall abstract the influence of the isothermal surfaces in order to simplify the problem of the deter mination of the form of the stratum As in art 1 the shell is here supposed to be rigid and to be perfectly filled  See BIscHOF Lehrbuch der Chem und Phys Geologie Bd I s 584 and Bd II s 6 525 MDCCCLI 3 YMR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS with the fluid matter but here we cannot consider the transition from solidity to fluidity as abrupt Many physical analogies lead us to believe that on the contrary this transition must be gradual or that a stratum of matter not completely fluid must exist between the highly fluid matter of the nucleus and the solid matter of the shell The transition from this imperfectly fluid stratum to the perfectly fluid matter within it will be also gradual but it is possible to conceive that a portion of it in immediate contact with the shell may merely possess that kind of fluidity which in solids would be considered extreme softness This matter will cohere to the shell with a considerable force compared to the cohesion of the fluid particles and this fact combined with its viscidity must serve to remove any doubt as to its not being subjected to the same hydrostatical laws as the perfect fluid If now a surface be conceived to exist which may be called the effective surface of separation of the per fect from the imperfect fluid it is evident that its form will depend on the pressures which the former tends to exert Let AEBF in the accompanying figure represent the profile of the inner surface of the shell aebf of the similar and concentric surface of the perfect fluid In this case the pressure exerted by the nucleus would be the same for all points of the shell and the thickness of the stratum of imperfect fluid would be everywhere the same If however the pressure of the perfect fluid were not constant its surface would tend to assume a different form in order to reestablish equilibrium it might 526MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS for example tend to assume the form of which cgdh is the profile The thick ness of the stratum of imperfect fluid would then be greatest at A and least at E On solidifying the new stratum thus added to the shell would have the same proportional thickness and its interior surface would in this particular case be more elliptical than its exterior surface If as seems extremely probable the imperfectly fluid stratum be thin and if it strongly adhere to the shell it will exercise no sensible pressure on the perfect fluid and must consequently take the form impressed on it without any sensible resistance 12 It can be easily shown that in general the pressure of the perfect fluid will not be constant Let a spheroidal mass of fluid be conceived consisting of nearly similar spheroidal strata these strata increasing in density as their radii decrease The ellipticities of the bounding surfaces of any stratum will depend on the con stitution and thickness of the strata outside it If possible let the mass outside the stratum be removed without altering the law of density of the remaining fluid it is manifest that equilibrium will be obtained only where the surface of the stratum at any point becomes perpendicular to the resultant of all the forces acting on that point With the same law of density as the entire mass and urged by the same forces the ellipticity of its surface must be the same as that of the surface of the primitive mass If however the law of density changed in such a way as to render the remaining fluid more homogeneous the ellipticity of its surface would be greater than that of the primitive fluid spheroid Hence we may conclude1 that if the angular velocity and law of density of the nucleus remained unchanged after the formation of the first stratum of the shell the outer and inner surfaces of that stratum would be similar and its attraction on the interior mass would consequently by a wellknown theorem be evanescent The next formed stratum would thus also have similar surfaces and so on with every stratum until the mass should have completely solidified In this case therefore the surfaces of all the strata would have the same ellipticity as the outer surface 2 If the forces acting on the nucleus after the solidification of the first stratum of the primitive fluid were such as to give the surface of the nucleus a tendency to become less oblate the ellipticity of the interior surface of the imperfectly fluid stratum would be less than that of its exterior surface and the resulting attraction of the shell after the solidification would manifestly tend to increase in the same direction the effect of the forces previously in action 3 If on the contrary the resultant of all these forces were such as to increase the oblate ness of the perfect fluid it is evident from the preceding considerations that the inner surface of the shell so produced would always be more elliptical than its outer surface These conclusions will be necessarily modified when the influence of the isothermal surfaces in the interior of the spheroid is considered It seems that no complete and general solution of the problem of finding the forms of these surfaces has been yet  See POIssoN Mecanique ii p 546 2nd edition 3 2 527MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS achieved but an approximate solution founded on an hypothesis to which no weighty objections can be urged has been given by Mr HOPKINS This solution will suf fice for my present purpose particularly when I only refer to the general result of his analysis The result in question is that the oblateness of the isothermal surfaces increases with their distance from the earths surface This result combined with the first of the three conclusions in the foregoing paragraph seenls to show that if the earth solidified from its surface to its centre without changing its law of density the ellipticity of the shells inner surface would be greater than that of its outer surface The truth of the second conclusion would be considerably weakened while that of the third would be strengthened to the same amount 13 It will immediately appear thlat this last is the conclusion which must be de finitely adopted if we admit that the matter composing the nucleus becomes denser in assuming the solid state Using the notation of art 6 and neglecting the effect of isothermal surfaces the ellipticity of the surface of the perfect fluid may be generally expressed thus em qalmtal a the double sign being placed before mtala to show that according as the ellipticity of the shells inner surface is greater or less than that of its outer surface this term should be added or subtracted as must appear from the theory of thle attraction of spheroids If when el is supposed to increase the small term alluded to be neglected the truth of any conclusion as to the rapid increase of el deduced from an examina tion of the remaining term will be only rendered still more manifest Let at any period of the shells existence the surface of the nucleus be supposed to coincide with the shells inner surface then mm and consequently from the

rotation upon its principal moments of inertia and the resulting connexion which thus subsists between these phenomena and the internal constitution of the earth renders a complete investiga tion of

constitution 531MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS of the earth Thus an expression for finding a has been obtained in which e is absent the elimination having been effected between the expressions depending on the variation of gravity at the earths surface and the precessional phenomena 2 As CACBM4 it follows that the difference of the principal moments of inertia of the earth is proportional to t But from the general expression for t and from Section IV it is evident that t increases as a diminishes hence we may in general conclude that the diJerence between the greatest and least moment of inertia of the earth increases as the thickness of the shell increases This conclusion being independent of any knowledge of the absolute laws of density of the earths interior deserves particular attention VI ON THE EXISTENCE OF A SOLID NUCLEUS WITHIN THE EARTH 15 In the preceding investigations the earth has been supposed to solidify solely from its surface towards its centre but it is possible to conceive how from the enor mous pressure on its central strata solidification could also proceed from the centre towards the surface If the influence of pressure in promoting solidification were sufficiently great the earth might have solidified entirely from its centre towards its surface according to the theory proposed by POIssoN It becomes important there fore to examine how far we are justified in adopting the theory of solidification first mentioned If solidification took place from the centre towards the surface alone we should believe the earth to be now entirely solid The forms of the solid strata composing the spheroid in this case would not be in general the same as if the original fluid mass had solidified from its surface towards its centre Before the solidification of any part of the mass it would consist in virtue of hydrostatical laws of a series of sphe roidal strata of equal pressure Refrigeration at the centre would proceed at an almost insensible r ate from the impediments to convection adduced in article 6 Part I and from the necessarily slow conducting power of the fluid and the theory of solidi fication examined requiring the predonlinance of pressure over refrigeration as an agent in solidifying the mass it must follow that the forms of the isothermal surfaces would have little influence on those of the solidified strata For greater simplicity I abstract in the first instance the effects of refrigeration in contracting the solid nucleus and the surrounding fluid The first small nucleus solidified would evidently be bounded by the surface of equal pressure due to its radius No change can take place therefore in the direc tion of the resultant of the forces acting on any molecule of the stratum in contact with the solid nucleus and hence on solidifying it will retain its formn The next stratum must become solid similarly without changing its form and so on towards the surface Hence the ellipticities of the strata of the solid spheroid would be the same as when it existed in a fluid state 532MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS If the effect of refrigeration in contracting the matter of the entire spheroid be now considered it is evident that it will tend to lessen the mean radius of the entire mass and consequently to increase its angular velocity of rotation The ellipticities of the strata of fluid surrounding the nucleus would be greater after every new addition to its mass than they were before that addition took place and therefore after the com plete solidification of the entire mass its strata would increase in ellipticity frorn its centre to its surface more rapidly than the strata of the original fluid mass increased in ellipticity In this case the variation of giavity at the surface of the earth in going from its equator to its poles should by the theory of the attraction of spheroids be greater than for the same mass in a fluid state with the same ellipticity at surface Ob servation however shows that on the contrary the variation of gravity at the earths surface is less rapid than for the primitively fluid spheroid The earth could not therefore have solidified in this manner required by this theory 16 If by the action of refrigeration and compression solidification proceeded simultaneously from the surface towards the centre and from the centre towards the surface it will not be doubted but that the former process when once commenced must proceed far more rapidly than the latter The temperature at the centre would be nearly constant compared with the temperature of the surface of the fluid from the obstacles opposed to convection and the laws of propagation of heat by conduc tion Solidification at the centre will therefore be due chiefly to pressure but if con traction accompany the change of state of the fluid matter in becoming solid it ap pears from Section III that the pressure on every stratum of the fluid will decrease with the radius of the shells inner surface The pressure on the solid nucleus will thus be continually diminishing while its temperature will remain almost unchanged The solid nucleus would therefore instead of acquiring increased magnitude tend to return to its original fluid state This will evidently be true at every period of the existence of the nucleus and hence we must conclude that this mode of solidification is incompatible with our original assumptions VII THE DIRECTIONS OF THE FISSURES IN THE SHELL WHICH MIGHT BE PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF THE PRESSURES CONSIDERED IN SECTION I 17 If the pressure of the nucleus against any part of the shell be sufficiently in tense to produce a fissure the direction of that fissure will depend on those of the tensions resulting from the fluid pressure and on the physical structure of the shell In the actual case of the earth it is probable that the highly crystalline structure which we have reason to believe is characteristic of the shell would give to some portions of it a tendency to fiacture in particular directions We have at present no precise physical reasons for thinking that this tendency should follow any general law so that it must now be considered as only a source of irregular deviations in the directions of the fissures from those which they would have if the shell possessed an uniform cohesive strength MDCCCLI 3 z 533MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS Abstracting these irregular causes an examination of the question of the directions of the fissures in a spheroidal and nearly spherical shell composed of strata each possessing in itself an uniforn cohesive strength but differing in this respect from every other would assist in pointing out what should be the predominant directions of the fissures if the greater effectiveness of general over particular causes be allowed The problem which is here to be examined is therefore simply to find the directions of the fissures in a thin solid and nearly spherical shell resulting from the pressures of a mass of fluid inclosed in it the cohesion of the shell being supposed to vary according to some continuous law along a vertical line from its inner to its outer surface If the constant pressure referred to in Section I alone acted on the shell the ten sions at any point in one of the shells indefinitely thin strata would be equal to each other and situated in the tangent plane at that point The position of the maximum resultant tension would tlerefore be indeterminate and consequently there would be no tendency tform a fissure in any particular direction rather than in any other If the variable pressure be superimposed on the constant pressure the direction of the maximnum resultant tension would be determinate and consequently also the line in which a fissure would connmmence At first if the intensity of the pressures should gradually increase a portion of the shell at each side of the equator bounded by parallels would be subjected to tensions sufficiently glreat to ptoduce fissures while beyond these parallels the shell would remain unfiractured The portion where the tensions would be sufficiently great to produce fissures would thrs constitute a dis turbed district with nearly fixed boundaries At a point where there is a tendency to wards the formation of a fissure the direction of the maximum resultant tension will be in the direction of the tangent to the meridian the greatest tendency to form a fissure will therefore be parallel to the equator From the nature of the variable pressure the maximumr tensions must be equal at equal distances from the equator hence such a fissure when once commenced would tend to be propagated along a parallel of latitude until the force of the tensions become sufficiently lessened by the separation of the extended portion of the shell Similar fissures would be formed simultaneously and symmetrically at each side of the equator As long as the ten sions in the directions of the tangents to the meridians continued sufficiently great such fissures would be formed  but as already mentioned their formation would tend to annul these tensions and a new system would result having a tendency as may be readily deduced from Mr HOPKINSS investigations to produce fissures perpendicular to those previously formed If the maximum intensity of the variable pressure be not inconsiderable compared to the constant pressure it will follow if the pressures continue to act with sufficient energy that all the shells fissures will be either parallel or perpendicular to the equator If on the contrary the constant pressure were far greater than the variable pres  Cambridge Philosophical Transactions vol vi 534MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS sure the maximumt and minimum resultant tensions would be nearly equal and con sequently the directions of the fissures would be governed chiefly by accidental causes Taking into consideration the causes which have been abstracted it appears therefore that the directions of the fissures might in general have no necessary rela tions with that of the equator If such a fissure commenced forming in the direction of any great circle it would evidently continue to be propagated in the same general direction unless accidental causes should alter its course At some stages of the shells existence the relation between the variable and the constant pressure might be such as to cause the maximum tension at any point to be in the direction of the tangent of the meridian or parallel at that point and hence in this case at least all simultaneously formed fissures should be parallel the term parallel being used to mean that the tangents to the circles forming the prolon gations of these fissures should all form equal angles at the points of intersection with the tangents of a great circle bisecting them VIII ON THE EXISTENCE OF A ZONE OF LEAST DISTURBANCE IN THE SHELL 18 During the process of the formation of the shell the forces tending to fracture it and those holding its parts together will in general be continually varying If the intensity of the former class of forces increased much nmore rapidly than that of the latter there would be no limit to the disturbed part of the shell if on the contrary the latter class of forces increased more rapidly in intensity than the former some parts of the shell might after a certain time be comparatively undisturbed It is even possible to conceive if the constant pressure of the fluid against the shell be small that in some parts of the shell the cohesive forces keeping its particles together might be always greater than the rupturing forces at these parts In order to form a general idea of the positions of such undisturbed portions of the shell the variation of the effective pressure at any point in the shell must be con sidered Of the two different ways in which the effective pressure colld vary in going from the equator to the pole of the shell it is evident from Section IV that the only one which it is necessary to consider is that of its decrease In this case we may conclude from article 2 that the pressure everywhere between the equator and parallel of mean pressure must be greater than that which exists at the same parallel and that everywhere between this line and the pole the pressure will on the contrary be less The disturbed portion of the shell must therefore be near the equator and that line must divide it into two equal parts In order that an undisturbed zone of the shell may exist it is not necessary that the latter should be perfectly rigid it may be capable of subsiding by the abstraction of a certain amount of the pressure of the fluid until its parts should rest in equilibrium With a considerable variable pressure and a constant pressure insufficient to produce fractures in the shell it is possible to conceive how this could occur and hence the most general idea which can be formed of the undisturbed portion of the shell at either side of the equator is that 3 z 2 535MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS it must be a zone bounded by two parallels both of which may become coincident with the equator or evanescent according as the pressures are very small or very great If it be admitted that any great disturbances in the shell must have been chiefly due to the action of such pressures it would be useful to exatmine the probleln of the de termlination of the boundaries of the zone of least disturbance By comparing the results of our investigation with observed phenomena we may be able to deduce some conclusions directly applicable to geology I proceed therefore to deterlnine the analytical expressions for the latitude of the limiting parallel of rupture on the side of the zone nearest to the equator Let 02 re present this latitude 03 the latitude of a parallel in the supposed undisturbed part of the shell It will appear that the general equation between the rupturing and cohesive forces upon which the position of the parallel of mean pressure depends can when the influence of temperature is abstracted be made to contain but two independent variables 0 atnd a or that it will be of the form F0 a0 The value required of 02 must evidently be a maxirnurm and hence we must determine it in general by eli mination between the equations F02 a da  d da0  or d 0 Fda d dal the fact of the resulting value bSing a maximum or minimum can be determined as d2O usual by the sign of da 19 Let two infinite planes be conceived to pass through the axis of rotation of the shell making so small an angle with each other that the curvature of the arc of the equator intercepted between then could be considered as insensible The ratio of the rupturing to the cohesive forces in either of the opposite portions of the shell thus intercepted will be the same as for the whole shell under our assumed conditions The conditions for finding the section of rupture of one of these bands will therefore be the same as those for the entire shell Let dL represent an element of the area of the section of rupture I its perpen dicular distance fromn the neutral surface 1 and 1 the perpendicular distances of the neutral surface from the outer and inner surfaces of the shell s the resistance mneasured by the number of units of force required to rupture a square unit of section of the material of the shell at the distance I The meaning generally attached in works on mechanics to the term neutral surface is that here attached to it namely the surface at which the portions of the band subjected to the rupturing forces are neither compressed nor extended Let as is generally assumed s be a function of I and let s be its value at the distance 11 If the deflection of the band in a state of tension and bordering on rupture be very small as must undoubtedly be the case fiom its physical structure the directions of 536MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS the rupturing forces will be perpendicular to the neutral surface and therefore from a wellknown property of that surface 1 and 1 will be the perpendicular distances of the centre of gravity of the section of rupture from the outer and inner surfaces of the shell The force developed upon the element dL opposed to the compression or extension of the material of the band at the distance 11 will be sT dL and its moment about the line formed by the intersection of the neutral surface with the section of rupture will be 12dL Let r2

all comparisons heretofore made of the mean and surface density of the earth the mean density of the sedimentary rocks has been erroneously taken into consideration From a comparison of the densities of granite obtained in different countries on the authority of different geological and engineering works I have decided that the mean density of the rock cannot be less than 27 Adopting this value

Q045253 X sin n20260259 GEOLOGICAL DEDUCTIONS FROM THE FOREGOING INVESTIGATIONS 1 The Stability of the Axis of Rotation of the Earth 23 The conclusion arrived at in article 14 shows that if the rotation of the earth were originally stable about its axis it would continue to rotate in the same way for ever The action of exterior bodies has been heretofore alone examined in considering the question of the position of the earths axis of rotation within it From this exami nation it results that the action of such bodies would be incapable of producing any change in the position of the axis and hence if such a change were at all possible it should be produced by some interior action by which the distribution of the particles composing the earth would be changed It is admitted that if the earth were fluid and in rotation with an angular velocity differing but little from its present angular velocity it would rotate stably about its shorter axis During the process of its suc cessive solidification it might happen that the new arrangements of the particles  See HUMBOLDTS Kosmos Bd I s 174 and PONTICOULANT tonle iv p 486 4A2 543MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS might be such as to disturb the rotation not only by increasing or lessening the an gular velocity but also by changing the position of the axis It appears however from the article cited that the difference of the greatest and least moment of inertia of the earth must progressively increase during the process of solidification and hence that the stability of rotation must continually increase until it reaches its limit when the mass shall have arrived at the entirely solid state Thus not only does a question closely connected with geological theory seem to be definitively settled but also the future stability of the earths rotation appears to be completely assured 2 The Thickness of the Earths Solid Crust 24 In Section II expressions have been obtained in which the variation of gravity at the earths surface is a function of the radius and ellipticity of the fluid nucleus supposed to exist within it from which it will be possible to deduce the limiting values of that radius and consequently of the thickness of the solid shell If we riefer to the general expression 20 it will be perceived ttlat the greater is e the less the thickness of the shell hence we would be able to obtain its greatest thick ness consistent with observation other quantities remaining unchanged by giving to e its least value But from Section IV the least value of e is e or the ellipticity of the surface of the shell hence in this case mm and x 33faaafa m  2e3pae The greatest value which a can receive will depend on the limits imposed on the values of the functions depending on the earths internal constitution and if we give to these values favourable to a large value of a el must very nearly be equal to e The above expression for X will therefore suffice for this case by attributing the proper values to the functions fa andfal But when ee we have by the expression deduced in article 5 X  2em 2  2alve v representing the same quantity as in article 13 I will differ but little from a when ele and with a continuous law of density of the strata of the shell hence in a first 5 approximation we may assume their equality But Xme e being the value of e deduced by the ordinary theory from observation of the variation of gravity at the earths surface hence 2 5o3eeel 1 ay 13 6e5o2emJ To find the limiting values of a we must make this a maximum or a minimunm If we suppose v to differ

d0 gives a minimum for a This value is evidently  3q2p On substituting this in the value of a we shall have a10 dr 0 would be also satisfied by making co  but the supposition that v is finite and little different from 1 excludes this value Hence a must increase from its least value as a decreases to its least value but this is when al1 or when the shell is supposed to be homo geneous consequently the greatest value of a will be determined from the equation 5 5 5 Ix  am 2e A m m  e 5m 2 e 2 1 4me al   5 3  35 35 3me 3m e me From Section IX e94 nearly and using for e and nm the

From Section III it appears that as k diminishes the more will the constitution of the nucleus and shell be different and consequently the least value which can be attributed to k from observation may be assumed to give the least value of a in equation 35 By using this equation together with 29 I find after a few trials that with a85 the approximate value of Q would be 023441 But Q increases with al hence the greatest thickness of the shell cannot on the above assumption be greater than 15 or 600 miles nearly 3 The Earths Ellipticity when entirely fluid 25 By the aid of equation 11 Part I the following values of the earths primi tive ellipticity have been obtained with different values of k With k 7481 E30222 k  896 E310 1 E3 k16 545MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL4 PHYSICS The value of the earths moment of inertia used in these calculations was deduced by using the value of p found in Section IX and that of A found from the lunar inequalities If the value of the latter quantity found in the section referred to were used the resulting values of E would all be a little smaller it may therefore be concluded that the earths primitive ellipticity was less than its present ellipticity although the difference between them may be neglected 4 The Direction of great Lines of Elevation on the Surface of the Earth 26 If a zone of least disturbance existed near the parallel of mean pressure the directions of great lines of elevation should be nearly parallel or perpendicular to the equator Its nonexistence there which observation seems to show proves at least that the variable pressure did not predominate over the constant pressure As yet observation seems to prove that such a zone does not exist on the earths surface and hence from Section VIII we must provisionally conclude that the con stant pressure greatly predominated over the variable pressure and consequently that the directions of lines of elevation must be comparatively arbitrary Geological and geographical observations present results which are generally in accordance with these views 5 The Existence of great Friction and Pressure at the Surface of Contact of the Nucleus and Shell 27 The conclusions arrived at in Section IV combined with the important result obtained by Mr HOPKINS in his second memoir on Physical Geology show that great friction and pressure must exist between the shell and fluid nucleus The result alluded to as quoted in Mr HOPKINSS third memoir is P 1P PI X1 h P1 where P denotes the precession of a solid homogeneous spheroid of which the ellipti citysl that of the earths exterior surface and P the precession of the earth sup posed to consist of a heterogeneous fluid nucleus contained in a heterogeneous sphe roidal shell of which the interior and exterior ellipticities are respectively s and s the transition being immediate from the entire solidity of the shell to the perfect fluidity of the mass This result was found on the hypothesis of the nonexistence of friction and pressure from molecular causes at the surface of contact of the shell and nucleus if this hypothesis were true we should have in general from articles 12 and 13 P Z P or at least we could not have P7 P1 This result is so different from that obtained by this observation that we are entitled to assume that the motion of rota tion of both shell and nucleus takes place nearly as if the mass were entirely solid It must evidently result that at the surface of contact of the solid and fluid a con  Philosophical Transactions 1840 p 207 546MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS siderable amount of friction and pressure should necessarily exist From physical reasons there is also a great probability of the truth of this proposition The highly crystalline structure which must necessarily be assigned to the shells inner surface combined with the viscidity of the strata of the nucleus in immediate contact with it would evidently if sufficiently great tend constantly to equalize the motions of both shell and nucleus and to cause the whole to rotate as one mass Of the truth of the fundamental assumption in article 1 I nlay therefore venture to hope no reasonable doubt can exist 6 The Amount of Elastic Gases given off at the Surface of the Nucleus during different Geological Epochs 28 If in the strata of the nucleus elastic gases were confined by the compression of the superior strata it must follow from Section III that during the solidification of the upper parts of the ide the rest will tend to expand and consequently to set free the confined gases If the amount of elastic gases in a cubic unit of any stratum be proportional to the pressure to whic that stratum is subjected it must follow that the quantity evolved on the solidification of the surface stratum must be pro portional to the amount of contraction of that stratum in solidifying The expansion of the other sttata yet in a fluid state would also tend to produce an evolution of such gases The evolution of gases from the solidifying stratum would evidently be proportional to 1ka2 and from any other stratum with the radius a proportional to the density g of that stratum But it has been shown in Section III that in general g and Ik decrease as a decreases hence we may conclude that the amount of elastic gases given off from the surface of the nucleus rapidly decreases as the thickness of the shell increases 7 The Distribution of the Waters on the Surface of the Globe 29 The expressions for the variation of gravity obtained in Section II show that if the angular velocity of rotation of the earth remained unchanged the waters on its surface would tend to accumulate towards the equator by the gradual thickening of the shell and the consequent change in the direction of gravity 547

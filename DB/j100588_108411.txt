J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108411,RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS PART II,I207006, 511  XXII RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICSPART II BY HENRY HENNESSY MRIA 8FC COMMUNICATED BY MAJOR LUDLOW BEAMISH FRS RECEIVED FEBRUARY 8READ MARCH 15 1849 PRELIMINARY REMARKS IN THE FIRST PART OF THESE RESEARCHES I HAVE ENDEAVOURED BY GENERALIZING THE HYPOTHESIS ON WHICH IS USUALLY FOUNDED THE THEORY OF THE EARTHS FIGURE NOT ONLY TO IMPROVE THAT THEORY BUT ALSO TO ESTABLISH A SECURE BASIS FOR RESEARCHES INTO THE CHANGES WHICH MAY HAVE TAKEN PLACE WITHIN AND AT THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH DURING THE EPOCHS OF ITS GEOLOGICAL HISTORY ALTHOUGH I STATED THAT NO PRECISE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE COULD BE ADDUCED FOR THE EXAMINATION OF THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MOLECULES OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUID SUPPOSED TO HAVE CONSTITUTED THLE EARTH RETAINED THEIR POSITIONS AFTETR SOLIDIFICA TION IT YET APPEARS THAT SUCH EVIDENCE EXISTS IF WE MAY BE PERMITTED TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS RELATIVE TO THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SUBSTANCES IN THE EARTHS INTERIOR FROM THE OBSERVED PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SUBSTANCES AT ITS SURFACE PROFESSOR BISCHOF OF BONN HAS SHOWN THAT GRANITE CONTRACTS IN VOLUME IN PASSING FROM THE FLUID TO THE SOLID CRYSTALLINE STATE FROM 1 TO 7481 TRACHYTE FROM 1 TO 8187 AND BASALT FROM 1 TO 8960 THE FIRST OF THESE ROCKS APPEARS AS FAR AS CAN BE OBSERVED TO CON STITUTE THE GREATER PART OF THE EARTH  HENCE THE ASSUMPTION ALLUDED TO MUST BE CON SIDERED NOT ONLY AS SUPERFLUOUS BUT AS ERRONEOUS IN THIS PART IT IS MY OBJECT TO DISCOVER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE INTERIOR STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH AND PHENOMENA OBSERVED AT ITS SURFACE AND ALSO THE EFFECTS OF THE REACTION OF THE FLUID NUCLEUS DESCRIBED IN ARTICLE 6 PART I UPON THE SOLID CRUST I DIVIDE THIS PART INTO SECTIONS EACH CONTAINING A DISTINCT INVESTIGATION THE ORDER OF ARRANGE MENT OF THESE SECTIONS BEING DETERMINED ACCORDING TO THEIR FUNDATNENTAL IMPORTANCE THE STATEMENT OF THE GEOLOGICAL RESULTS CAPABLE OF BEING DEDUCED FROMN THESE INVESTI GATIONS IS FOR GREATER CLEARNESS RESERVED FOR THE END SUCH OF THTESE RESULTS AS CHIEFLY DEPEND ON THE VALIDITY OF THE REASONINGS USED IN SECTION III ARE PRESENTED WITH SOME DIFFIDENCE OWING TO THE IMPERFECT EXPERIMENTAL KNOWLEDGE WE POSSESS RESPECTING THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED IN THAT SECTION THE DIMINUTION OF THE EARTHS MEAN RADIUS BY REFRI GERATION IS NEGLECTED ALL THROUGH EXCEPT WHERE THE CONTRARY IS SPECIALLY MENTIONED I THE PRESSURES OF THE SHELL AND NUCLEUS AT THEIR SURFACE OF CONTACT 1 IN THIS INVESTIGATION THE EARTH IS SUPPOSED TO CONSIST OF A NUCLEUS OF FLUID MATTER INCLOSED IN A SOLID SHELL THE INNER AND OUTER SURFACES OF THE SHELL ARE SUP  LEONHARD UND BRONNS NEUES JAHRBUCH 1841 P 565 SEE ALSO A PAPER BY THE SAME WRITER IN THE N JAHRBUCH FOR 1843 P 1 THESE RESULTS SEEM ALSO TO BE CONFIRMED BY OTHERS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND BY M DEVILLE 3 2MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS POSED TO BE SPHEROIDAL OBLATE AND NEARLY SPHERICAL BOTH SHELL AND NUCLEUS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FORMED OF STRATA INCREASING IN DENSITY ACCORDING TO UNKNOWN LAWS AS THE RADII OF THESE STRATA DECREASE IF THE EARTH WERE SOLID FROM ITS SURFACE TO ITS CENTRE ALL THE PHENOMENA OF ITS ROTA TION COULD BE DETERMINED BY THE INTEGRATION OF THREE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS RELATIVE TO ITS MOTION ABOUT ITS CENTRE OF GRAVITY AND OF THREE MORE RELATIVE TO THE MOTIONS OF ITS PRINCIPAL AXES REFERRED TO THREE RECTANGULAR AXES FIXED IN SPACE THE CONSTANTS CONTAINED IN THESE EQUATIONS WOULD DEPEND ON THE ATTRACTIONS OF EXTERIOR BODIES ON THE IMPRESSED FORCES AND ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTICLES COMPOSING THE EARTH IT IS EVIDENT THAT SIMILAR EQUATIONS WOULD SUFFICE FOR THE CASE OF AN EMPTY SHELL CON STITUTED IN THE MANNER ABOVE MENTIONED AFTER THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE CONSTANTS DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE AND INTERNAL CONSTITUTION OF THE SHELL FOR THOSE DEPEND ING ON THE MAGNITUDE AND INTERNAL CONSTITUTION OF THE ENTIRELY SOLID SPHEROID BY ADOPTING THIS METHOD NO NEW ANALYTICAL TRANSFORMATIONS ARE REQUIRED IN DISCOVERING THE PHENOMENA OF THE SHELLS INDEPENDENT ROTATION FOR WE CAN THUS AVAIL OURSELVES OF THE RESEARCHES ALREADY MADE BY GEOMETERS RELATIVE TO THE ROTATION OF THE ENTIRELY SOLID SPHEROID I HAVE THEREFORE THOUGHT IT SUFFICIENT FOR OUR PRESENT PURPOSES TO MNERELY PRESENT THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH I HAVE ARRIVED BY USING THE METHOD ABOVE INDICATED 1ST IF THE ORIGINAL IMPRESSED FORCES WERE THE SAME IN DIRECTION AND INTENSITY FOR THE SHELL ASFOR THE ENTIRELY SOLID SPHEROID THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE FORMER ABOUT ITS INSTANTANEOUS AXIS WOULD BE GREATER THAN THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF TILE LATTER ABOUT ITS INSTANTANEOUS AXIS 2ND THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERIOR DISTURBING FORCES WOULD BE INSENSIBLE RELATIVE TO THE ROTATION OF THE SHELL ABOUT ITS CENTRE PROVIDED THAT ITS STRATA POSSESS NEARLY SIMILAR LAWS OF ARRANGEMENT WITH THOSE OF THE SOLID SPHEROID 3RD THE MOTIONS IN SPACE OF THE AXES OF THE SHELL DUE TO THE ACTION OF EXTERIOR DISTURBING BODIES WOULD BE AFFECTED TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN SIMILAR MOTIONS OF THE AXES OF THE SOLID SPHEROID IF NO OTHER FORCES ACTED ON THE FLUID NUCLEUS BESIDES THE ATTRACTIONS OF ITS OWN PARTICLES THE ATTRACTION OF THE SHELL AND CENTRIFUGAL FORCE ITS SURFACE WOULD BE AN ELLIPSOID OF REVOLUTION AND IT WOULD ROTATE STEADILY ABOUT THE AXIS OF ITS GREATEST MO MENT OF INERTIA IF TIE ACTION OF EXTERIOR DISTURBING BODIES BE ADDED TO THESE FORCES TIDAL OSCILLATIONS IN THE SURFACE OF THE NUCLEUS WOULD TEND TO BE PRODUCED BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT UNLESS THE DISTURBING FORCES WERE VERY GREAT THE POSITION IN SPACE OF THE AXIS OF ROTATION OF THE MASS WOULD BE MUCH LESS AFFECTED THAN IF IT EXISTED IN THE SOLID STATE LET IN ADDITION TO THE FORCES ALREADY ENUMERATED AS ACTING ON THE FLUID NUCLEUS CERTAIN MOLECULAR FORCES BE CONCEIVED TO ACT ON ITS PARTICLES BY WHICH THE WHOLE MASS MIGHT IN GENERAL ACQUIRE A TENDENCY TO EXPAND OR CONTRACT AND ALSO TO CHANGE ITS FORM THIS CLASS OF FORCES MAY BE CONCEIVED TO BE RESOLVED INTO TWO PRESSURLES ACTING AT THE INNER SURFACE OF THE SHELL ONE OF THEM BEING SUPPOSED TO BE CONSTANT FOR EVERY POINT AND THE OTHER VARIABLE IF MOREOVER THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SHELL 512MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS AND NUCLEUS SHOULD BE FAVOURABLE TO A GREAT AMOUNT OF FRICTION AT THEIR SURFACE OF CONTACT IT IS AT LEAST POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE THAT IF THE SUM OF THE PRESSURES EXISTING AT THE SAME SURFACE BE SUFFICIENTLY GREAT THE WHOLE MASS MIGHT ROTATE NEARLY AS IF SOLID FROM ITS SURFACE TO ITS CENTRE AS IT WILL HEREAFTER APPEAR THAT SUCH CONDITIONS MUST ALMOST NECESSARILY EXIST IT IS SUPERFLUOUS FOR OUR PRESENT OBJECT TO FUIRTHER EXAMINE THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF THE ROTATION OF THE SHELL AND NUCLEUS I SHALL THEREFORE PROCEED TO CONSIDER THE PRESSURES WHICH MIGHT TAKE PLACE AT THE SURFACE OF CONTACT OF THE SHELL AND NUCLEUS 2 ABSTRACTING THE ACTION OF EXTERIOR DISTURBING BODIES THE PRESSURE OF THE NUCLEUS AT THE INNER SURFACE OF THE SHELL WILL RESULT FROM THE ATTRACTIONS OF ALL THE PARTICLES OF THE SHELL AND NUCLEUS CENTRIFUGAL FORCE AND MOLECULAR ACTIONS UNLESS THE LAST MENTIONED CLASS OF FORCES SHOULD HAVE A TENDENCY TO DISTURB THE POSITION OF THE AXES OF ROTATION OF THE SHELL AND NUCLEUS IT IS PLAIN THAT THESE AXES MAY BE CONSIDERED AS COINCIDENT OF THE TWO RESULTANT PRESSURES MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING ARTICLE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE VARIABLE PRESSURE MAY BE CONCEIVED TO RESULT FROM THE DIFFERENCE IN FORM OF THE FREE SURFACE OF THE NUCLEUS AND THE SHELLS INNER SURFACE IF THESE SURFACES BE VERY NEARLY SPHEROIDS OF REVOLUTION DESCRIBED ABOUT THE SHELLS AXIS OF ROTATION IT FOLLOWS THAT THE GREATEST PRESSURE WILL BE AT THE EQUATOR OR POLES OF THE SHELL ACCORDING AS THE TENDENCY OF THE NUCLEUS MAY BE TO BECOME MORE OR LESS OBLATE IN EITHER CASE IT IS EVIDENT THAT EVERY POINT ON CERTAIN LINES SITUATED BETWEEN THE EQUATOR AND POLES WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO ANY PRESSURE FROM THIS CAUSE OR IN OTHER WORDS THE SUM OF ALL THE PRESSURES AT THE POINTS IN QUESTION WILL BE EQUAL TO THE CONSTANT PRESSURE THE GENERAL EXPRESSION FOR THE PRESSURE AT ANY POINT OF THE SHELL MAY THEREFORE BE MADE TO CONTAIN THE COORDINATES OF THE LINES IN QUESTION AS CONSTANT QUANTITIES AS THESE LINES IN THE CASE CONSIDERED ARE EVIDENTLY CIRCLES PARALLEL TO THE EQUATOR OF THE SHELL WE MAY CALL THEM THE PARALLELS OF MEAN PRESSURE LET A STRAIGHT AND INDEFINITELY NARROW CANAL OF FLUID BE CONCEIVED TO REACH FIROM THE CENTRE TO THE SURFACE OF THE NUCLEUS LET THE ORIGIN OF THE COORDINATES OF ANY POINT IN IT BE FIXED AT THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF THE MASS AND LET THE PLANE OF X Y BE PERPENDICULAR TO THE AXIS OF ROTATION LET R REPRESENT THE RADIUS DRAWN FROM THE ORIGIN TO A MOLECULE IN THE CANAL A THE ANGLE MADE BY THIS

MATTER COMPOSING THE EARTHS INTERIOR WE SHOULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED IN ATTACHING MUCH IMPORTANCE TO ANY HY POTHESIS HOWEVER PLAUSIBLE WHICH MAY BE FORMED RELATIVE TO THE FORMS OF THESE LAWS SUCH GROUNDS WOULD PARTIALLY EXIST AS LONG AS DOUBTS COULD BE FORMED RELATIVE TO THE GREAT OR SMALL SPECIFIC DENSITY OF THE MATTER OF THE EARTHS INTERIOR THE VARIATION IN DENSITY OF THE SPHEROIDAL STRATA COMPOSING THE EARTH COULD BE DUE TO AN ACCUMULATION NEAR ITS CENTRE OF SUBSTANCES POSSESSING A HIGH SPECIFIC DENSITY FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF THE MATTER COMPOSING THE EARTH I BELIEVE THAT ALMOST ALL SUBSTANCES HAVING A DENSITY MUCH GREATER THAN THAT OF THE OUTER PORTION OF ITS CRUST ARE METALS BODIES WHICH FROM THEIR CHEMICAL NATURE DO NOT PROBABLY EXIST TO ANY GREAT EXTENT WITHIN THE GLOBE RECENT EXPERIMENTS TEND TO SHOW THAT MANY METALS ARE BUT COM POUND RADICALS WHICH EXIST ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE CONSTITUENTS OF ANY ONE OF THESE RADICALS HAVE DENSITIES LESS THAN THAT OF THE METAL ITSELF KANE LAURENT AND GERHARDT ARE OF OPINION FOR INSTANCE THAT THE KNOWN METALS DO NOT EXIST IN THEIR OXIDES BUT ARE ELIMINATED WHEN THE OXIDES ARE DECOM POSED THE METALS ALLUDED TO ARE ALSO SIMPLE BODIES IN THE SENSE GENERALLY USED NAMELY THAT OF BEING THE LOWEST TERMS AS YET KNOWN OF COMPOUND BODIES RECENT CHEMICAL RESEARCHES SEEM TO SHOW THAT SUCH SIMPLE BODIES EXISTED IN THE EARTHS PRI MITIVE STATE EVEN IN LESS QUANTITY THAN WE CAN AT PRESENT DISCOVER THEM THE CHEMICAL LAWS IN VIRTUE OF WHICH THIS WOULD BE TRUE WOULD UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS ACT AS WELL IN THE INTERIOR AS AT THE EARTHS SURFACE IF WE ARE ENTITLED AT ALL TO ADMIT THEIR GENERALITY AND HENCE WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT THE SPECIFIC DENSITY OF THE SUB STANCES IN THE EARTHS INTERIOR MUST BE SUBORDINATE TO THE EFFECTS OF MECHANICAL AND PHYSICAL CAUSES IN PRODUCING THE OBSERVED VARIATION IN THE DENSITY OF ITS STRATA IV THE FORMS OF THE STRATA OF THE SHELL 11 AS EVERY STRATUM OF THE SHELL WAS ORIGINALLY THE SURFACE STRATUM OF THE FLUID NUCLEUS ITS FORM MUST DEPEND ON THAT OF THE SHELLS INNER SURFACE AND OF THE ISO THERMAL SURFACES PASSING THROUGH ITS POLES AND EQUATOR AT FIRST I SHALL ABSTRACT THE INFLUENCE OF THE ISOTHERMAL SURFACES IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM OF THE DETER MINATION OF THE FORM OF THE STRATUM AS IN ART 1 THE SHELL IS HERE SUPPOSED TO BE RIGID AND TO BE

CONSIDER THE TRANSITION FROM SOLIDITY TO FLUIDITY AS ABRUPT MANY PHYSICAL ANALOGIES LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT ON THE CONTRARY THIS TRANSITION MUST BE GRADUAL OR THAT A STRATUM OF MATTER NOT COMPLETELY FLUID MUST EXIST BETWEEN THE HIGHLY FLUID MATTER OF THE NUCLEUS AND THE SOLID MATTER OF THE SHELL THE TRANSITION FROM THIS IMPERFECTLY FLUID STRATUM TO THE PERFECTLY FLUID MATTER WITHIN IT WILL BE ALSO GRADUAL BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE THAT A PORTION OF IT IN IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH THE SHELL MAY MERELY POSSESS THAT KIND OF FLUIDITY WHICH IN SOLIDS WOULD BE CONSIDERED EXTREME SOFTNESS THIS MATTER WILL COHERE TO THE SHELL WITH A CONSIDERABLE FORCE COMPARED TO THE COHESION OF THE FLUID PARTICLES AND THIS FACT COMBINED WITH ITS VISCIDITY MUST SERVE TO REMOVE ANY DOUBT AS TO ITS NOT BEING SUBJECTED TO THE SAME HYDROSTATICAL LAWS AS THE PERFECT FLUID IF NOW A SURFACE BE CONCEIVED TO EXIST WHICH MAY BE CALLED THE EFFECTIVE SURFACE OF SEPARATION OF THE PER FECT FROM THE IMPERFECT FLUID IT IS EVIDENT THAT ITS FORM WILL DEPEND ON THE PRESSURES WHICH THE FORMER TENDS TO EXERT LET AEBF IN THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURE REPRESENT THE PROFILE OF THE INNER SURFACE OF THE SHELL AEBF OF THE SIMILAR AND CONCENTRIC SURFACE OF THE PERFECT FLUID IN THIS CASE THE PRESSURE EXERTED BY THE NUCLEUS WOULD BE THE SAME FOR ALL POINTS OF THE SHELL AND THE THICKNESS OF THE STRATUM OF IMPERFECT FLUID WOULD BE EVERYWHERE THE SAME IF HOWEVER THE PRESSURE OF THE PERFECT FLUID WERE NOT CONSTANT ITS SURFACE WOULD TEND TO ASSUME A DIFFERENT FORM IN ORDER TO REESTABLISH EQUILIBRIUM IT MIGHT 526MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS FOR EXAMPLE TEND TO ASSUME THE FORM OF WHICH CGDH IS THE PROFILE THE THICK NESS OF THE STRATUM OF IMPERFECT FLUID WOULD THEN BE GREATEST AT A AND LEAST AT E ON SOLIDIFYING THE NEW STRATUM THUS ADDED TO THE SHELL WOULD HAVE THE SAME PROPORTIONAL THICKNESS AND ITS INTERIOR SURFACE WOULD IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BE MORE ELLIPTICAL THAN ITS EXTERIOR SURFACE IF AS SEEMS EXTREMELY PROBABLE THE IMPERFECTLY FLUID STRATUM BE THIN AND IF IT STRONGLY ADHERE TO THE SHELL IT WILL EXERCISE NO SENSIBLE PRESSURE ON THE PERFECT FLUID AND MUST CONSEQUENTLY TAKE THE FORM IMPRESSED ON IT WITHOUT ANY SENSIBLE RESISTANCE 12 IT CAN BE EASILY SHOWN THAT IN GENERAL THE PRESSURE OF THE PERFECT FLUID WILL NOT BE CONSTANT LET A SPHEROIDAL MASS OF FLUID BE CONCEIVED CONSISTING OF NEARLY SIMILAR SPHEROIDAL STRATA THESE STRATA INCREASING IN DENSITY AS THEIR RADII DECREASE THE ELLIPTICITIES OF THE BOUNDING SURFACES OF ANY STRATUM WILL DEPEND ON THE CON STITUTION AND THICKNESS OF THE STRATA OUTSIDE IT IF POSSIBLE LET THE MASS OUTSIDE THE STRATUM BE REMOVED WITHOUT ALTERING THE LAW OF DENSITY OF THE REMAINING FLUID IT IS MANIFEST THAT EQUILIBRIUM WILL BE OBTAINED ONLY WHERE THE SURFACE OF THE STRATUM AT ANY POINT BECOMES PERPENDICULAR TO THE RESULTANT OF ALL THE FORCES ACTING ON THAT POINT WITH THE SAME LAW OF DENSITY AS THE ENTIRE MASS AND URGED BY THE SAME FORCES THE ELLIPTICITY OF ITS SURFACE MUST BE THE SAME AS THAT OF THE SURFACE OF THE PRIMITIVE MASS IF HOWEVER THE LAW OF DENSITY CHANGED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO RENDER THE REMAINING FLUID MORE HOMOGENEOUS THE ELLIPTICITY OF ITS SURFACE WOULD BE GREATER THAN THAT OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUID SPHEROID HENCE WE MAY CONCLUDE1 THAT IF THE ANGULAR VELOCITY AND LAW OF DENSITY OF THE NUCLEUS REMAINED UNCHANGED AFTER THE FORMATION OF THE FIRST STRATUM OF THE SHELL THE OUTER AND INNER SURFACES OF THAT STRATUM WOULD BE SIMILAR AND ITS ATTRACTION ON THE INTERIOR MASS WOULD CONSEQUENTLY BY A WELLKNOWN THEOREM BE EVANESCENT THE NEXT FORMED STRATUM WOULD THUS ALSO HAVE SIMILAR SURFACES AND SO ON WITH EVERY STRATUM UNTIL THE MASS SHOULD HAVE COMPLETELY SOLIDIFIED IN THIS CASE THEREFORE THE SURFACES OF ALL THE STRATA WOULD HAVE THE SAME ELLIPTICITY AS THE OUTER SURFACE 2 IF THE FORCES ACTING ON THE NUCLEUS AFTER THE SOLIDIFICATION OF THE FIRST STRATUM OF THE PRIMITIVE FLUID WERE SUCH AS TO GIVE THE SURFACE OF THE NUCLEUS A TENDENCY TO BECOME LESS OBLATE THE ELLIPTICITY OF THE INTERIOR SURFACE OF THE IMPERFECTLY FLUID STRATUM WOULD BE LESS THAN THAT OF ITS EXTERIOR SURFACE AND THE RESULTING ATTRACTION OF THE SHELL AFTER THE SOLIDIFICATION WOULD MANIFESTLY TEND TO INCREASE IN THE SAME DIRECTION THE EFFECT OF THE FORCES PREVIOUSLY IN ACTION 3 IF ON THE CONTRARY THE RESULTANT OF ALL THESE FORCES WERE SUCH AS TO INCREASE THE OBLATE NESS OF THE PERFECT FLUID IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE INNER SURFACE OF THE SHELL SO PRODUCED WOULD ALWAYS BE MORE ELLIPTICAL THAN ITS OUTER SURFACE THESE CONCLUSIONS WILL BE NECESSARILY MODIFIED WHEN THE INFLUENCE OF THE ISOTHERMAL SURFACES IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SPHEROID IS CONSIDERED IT SEEMS THAT NO COMPLETE AND GENERAL SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF FINDING THE FORMS OF THESE SURFACES HAS BEEN YET  SEE POISSON MECANIQUE II P 546 2ND EDITION 3 2 527MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS ACHIEVED BUT AN APPROXIMATE SOLUTION FOUNDED ON AN HYPOTHESIS TO WHICH NO WEIGHTY OBJECTIONS CAN BE URGED HAS BEEN GIVEN BY MR HOPKINS THIS SOLUTION WILL SUF FICE FOR MY PRESENT PURPOSE PARTICULARLY WHEN I ONLY REFER TO THE GENERAL RESULT OF HIS ANALYSIS THE RESULT IN QUESTION IS THAT THE OBLATENESS OF THE ISOTHERMAL SURFACES INCREASES WITH THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE EARTHS SURFACE THIS RESULT COMBINED WITH THE FIRST OF THE THREE CONCLUSIONS IN THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPH SEENLS TO SHOW THAT IF THE EARTH SOLIDIFIED FROM ITS SURFACE TO ITS CENTRE WITHOUT CHANGING ITS LAW OF DENSITY THE ELLIPTICITY OF THE SHELLS INNER SURFACE WOULD BE GREATER THAN THAT OF ITS OUTER SURFACE THE TRUTH OF THE SECOND CONCLUSION WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED WHILE THAT OF THE THIRD WOULD BE STRENGTHENED TO THE SAME AMOUNT 13 IT WILL IMMEDIATELY APPEAR THLAT THIS LAST IS THE CONCLUSION WHICH MUST BE DE FINITELY ADOPTED IF WE ADMIT THAT THE MATTER COMPOSING THE NUCLEUS BECOMES DENSER IN ASSUMING THE SOLID STATE USING THE NOTATION OF ART 6 AND

LEAST MOMENT OF INERTIA OF THE EARTH INCREASES AS THE THICKNESS OF THE SHELL INCREASES THIS CONCLUSION BEING INDEPENDENT OF ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE ABSOLUTE LAWS OF DENSITY OF THE EARTHS INTERIOR DESERVES PARTICULAR ATTENTION VI ON THE EXISTENCE OF A SOLID NUCLEUS WITHIN THE EARTH 15 IN THE PRECEDING INVESTIGATIONS THE EARTH HAS BEEN SUPPOSED TO SOLIDIFY SOLELY FROM ITS SURFACE TOWARDS ITS CENTRE BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE HOW FROM THE ENOR MOUS PRESSURE ON ITS CENTRAL STRATA SOLIDIFICATION COULD ALSO PROCEED FROM THE CENTRE TOWARDS THE SURFACE IF THE INFLUENCE OF PRESSURE IN PROMOTING SOLIDIFICATION WERE SUFFICIENTLY GREAT THE EARTH MIGHT HAVE SOLIDIFIED ENTIRELY FROM ITS CENTRE TOWARDS ITS SURFACE ACCORDING TO THE THEORY PROPOSED BY POISSON IT BECOMES IMPORTANT THERE FORE TO EXAMINE HOW FAR WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN ADOPTING THE THEORY OF SOLIDIFICATION FIRST MENTIONED IF SOLIDIFICATION TOOK PLACE FROM THE CENTRE TOWARDS THE SURFACE ALONE WE SHOULD BELIEVE THE EARTH TO BE NOW ENTIRELY SOLID THE FORMS OF THE SOLID STRATA COMPOSING THE SPHEROID IN THIS CASE WOULD NOT BE IN GENERAL THE SAME AS IF THE ORIGINAL FLUID MASS HAD SOLIDIFIED FROM ITS SURFACE TOWARDS ITS CENTRE BEFORE THE SOLIDIFICATION OF ANY PART OF THE MASS IT WOULD CONSIST IN VIRTUE OF HYDROSTATICAL LAWS OF A SERIES OF SPHE ROIDAL STRATA OF EQUAL PRESSURE REFRIGERATION AT THE CENTRE WOULD PROCEED AT AN ALMOST INSENSIBLE R ATE FROM THE IMPEDIMENTS TO CONVECTION ADDUCED IN ARTICLE 6 PART I AND FROM THE NECESSARILY SLOW CONDUCTING POWER OF THE FLUID AND THE THEORY OF SOLIDI FICATION EXAMINED REQUIRING THE PREDONLINANCE OF PRESSURE OVER REFRIGERATION AS AN AGENT IN SOLIDIFYING THE MASS IT MUST FOLLOW THAT THE FORMS OF THE ISOTHERMAL SURFACES WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THOSE OF THE SOLIDIFIED STRATA FOR GREATER SIMPLICITY I ABSTRACT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE EFFECTS OF REFRIGERATION IN CONTRACTING THE SOLID NUCLEUS AND THE SURROUNDING FLUID THE FIRST SMALL NUCLEUS SOLIDIFIED WOULD EVIDENTLY BE BOUNDED BY THE SURFACE OF EQUAL PRESSURE DUE TO ITS RADIUS NO CHANGE CAN TAKE PLACE THEREFORE IN THE DIREC TION OF THE RESULTANT OF THE FORCES ACTING ON ANY MOLECULE OF THE STRATUM IN CONTACT WITH THE SOLID NUCLEUS AND HENCE ON SOLIDIFYING IT WILL RETAIN ITS FORMN THE NEXT STRATUM MUST BECOME SOLID SIMILARLY WITHOUT CHANGING ITS FORM AND SO ON TOWARDS THE SURFACE HENCE THE ELLIPTICITIES OF THE STRATA OF THE SOLID SPHEROID WOULD BE THE SAME AS WHEN IT EXISTED IN A FLUID STATE 532MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS IF THE EFFECT OF REFRIGERATION IN CONTRACTING THE MATTER OF THE ENTIRE SPHEROID BE NOW CONSIDERED IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT WILL TEND TO LESSEN THE MEAN RADIUS OF THE ENTIRE MASS AND CONSEQUENTLY TO INCREASE ITS ANGULAR VELOCITY OF ROTATION THE ELLIPTICITIES OF THE STRATA OF FLUID SURROUNDING THE NUCLEUS WOULD BE GREATER AFTER EVERY NEW ADDITION TO ITS MASS THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THAT ADDITION TOOK PLACE AND THEREFORE AFTER THE COM PLETE SOLIDIFICATION OF THE ENTIRE MASS ITS STRATA WOULD INCREASE IN ELLIPTICITY FRORN ITS CENTRE TO ITS SURFACE MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE STRATA OF THE ORIGINAL FLUID MASS INCREASED IN ELLIPTICITY IN THIS CASE THE VARIATION OF GIAVITY AT THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH IN GOING FROM ITS EQUATOR TO ITS POLES SHOULD BY THE THEORY OF THE ATTRACTION OF SPHEROIDS BE GREATER THAN FOR THE SAME MASS IN A FLUID STATE WITH THE SAME ELLIPTICITY AT SURFACE OB SERVATION HOWEVER SHOWS THAT ON THE CONTRARY THE VARIATION OF GRAVITY AT THE EARTHS SURFACE IS LESS RAPID THAN FOR THE PRIMITIVELY FLUID SPHEROID THE EARTH COULD NOT THEREFORE HAVE SOLIDIFIED IN THIS MANNER REQUIRED BY THIS THEORY 16 IF BY THE ACTION OF REFRIGERATION AND COMPRESSION SOLIDIFICATION PROCEEDED SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE SURFACE TOWARDS THE CENTRE AND FROM THE CENTRE TOWARDS THE SURFACE IT WILL NOT BE DOUBTED BUT THAT THE FORMER PROCESS WHEN ONCE COMMENCED MUST PROCEED FAR MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE LATTER THE TEMPERATURE AT THE CENTRE WOULD BE NEARLY CONSTANT COMPARED WITH THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SURFACE OF THE FLUID FROM THE OBSTACLES OPPOSED TO CONVECTION AND THE LAWS OF PROPAGATION OF HEAT BY CONDUC TION SOLIDIFICATION AT THE CENTRE WILL THEREFORE BE DUE CHIEFLY TO PRESSURE BUT IF CON TRACTION ACCOMPANY THE CHANGE OF STATE OF THE FLUID MATTER IN BECOMING SOLID IT AP PEARS FROM SECTION III THAT THE PRESSURE ON EVERY STRATUM OF THE FLUID WILL DECREASE WITH THE RADIUS OF THE SHELLS INNER SURFACE THE PRESSURE ON THE SOLID NUCLEUS WILL THUS BE CONTINUALLY DIMINISHING WHILE ITS TEMPERATURE WILL REMAIN ALMOST UNCHANGED THE SOLID NUCLEUS WOULD THEREFORE INSTEAD OF ACQUIRING INCREASED MAGNITUDE TEND TO RETURN TO ITS ORIGINAL FLUID STATE THIS WILL EVIDENTLY BE TRUE AT EVERY PERIOD OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE NUCLEUS AND HENCE WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT THIS MODE OF SOLIDIFICATION IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH OUR ORIGINAL ASSUMPTIONS VII THE DIRECTIONS OF THE FISSURES IN THE SHELL WHICH MIGHT BE PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF THE PRESSURES CONSIDERED IN SECTION I 17 IF THE PRESSURE OF THE NUCLEUS AGAINST ANY PART OF THE SHELL BE SUFFICIENTLY IN TENSE TO PRODUCE A FISSURE THE DIRECTION OF THAT FISSURE WILL DEPEND ON THOSE OF THE TENSIONS RESULTING FROM THE FLUID PRESSURE AND ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE SHELL IN THE ACTUAL CASE OF THE EARTH IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE HIGHLY CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE WHICH WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SHELL WOULD GIVE TO SOME PORTIONS OF IT A TENDENCY TO FIACTURE IN PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS WE HAVE AT PRESENT NO PRECISE PHYSICAL REASONS FOR THINKING THAT THIS TENDENCY SHOULD FOLLOW ANY GENERAL LAW SO THAT IT MUST NOW BE CONSIDERED AS ONLY A SOURCE OF IRREGULAR DEVIATIONS IN THE DIRECTIONS OF THE FISSURES FROM THOSE WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE IF THE SHELL POSSESSED AN UNIFORM COHESIVE STRENGTH MDCCCLI 3 Z 533MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS ABSTRACTING THESE IRREGULAR CAUSES AN EXAMINATION OF THE QUESTION OF THE DIRECTIONS OF THE FISSURES IN A SPHEROIDAL AND NEARLY SPHERICAL SHELL COMPOSED OF STRATA EACH POSSESSING IN ITSELF AN UNIFORN COHESIVE STRENGTH BUT DIFFERING IN THIS RESPECT FROM EVERY OTHER WOULD ASSIST IN POINTING OUT WHAT SHOULD BE THE PREDOMINANT DIRECTIONS OF THE FISSURES IF THE GREATER EFFECTIVENESS OF GENERAL OVER PARTICULAR CAUSES BE ALLOWED THE PROBLEM WHICH IS HERE TO BE EXAMINED IS THEREFORE SIMPLY TO FIND THE DIRECTIONS OF THE FISSURES IN A THIN SOLID AND NEARLY SPHERICAL SHELL RESULTING FROM THE PRESSURES OF A MASS OF FLUID INCLOSED IN IT THE COHESION OF THE SHELL BEING SUPPOSED TO VARY ACCORDING TO SOME CONTINUOUS LAW ALONG A VERTICAL LINE FROM ITS INNER TO ITS OUTER SURFACE IF THE CONSTANT PRESSURE REFERRED TO IN SECTION I ALONE ACTED ON THE SHELL THE TEN SIONS AT ANY POINT IN ONE OF THE SHELLS INDEFINITELY THIN STRATA WOULD BE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER AND SITUATED IN THE TANGENT PLANE AT THAT POINT THE POSITION OF THE MAXIMUM RESULTANT TENSION WOULD TLEREFORE BE INDETERMINATE AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE WOULD BE NO TENDENCY TFORM A FISSURE IN ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION RATHER THAN IN ANY OTHER IF THE VARIABLE PRESSURE BE SUPERIMPOSED ON THE CONSTANT PRESSURE THE DIRECTION OF THE MAXIMNUM RESULTANT TENSION WOULD BE DETERMINATE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO THE LINE IN WHICH A FISSURE WOULD CONNMMENCE AT FIRST IF THE INTENSITY OF THE PRESSURES SHOULD GRADUALLY INCREASE A PORTION OF THE SHELL AT EACH SIDE OF THE EQUATOR BOUNDED BY PARALLELS WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO TENSIONS SUFFICIENTLY GLREAT TO PTODUCE FISSURES WHILE BEYOND THESE PARALLELS THE SHELL WOULD REMAIN UNFIRACTURED THE PORTION WHERE THE TENSIONS WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY GREAT TO PRODUCE FISSURES WOULD THRS CONSTITUTE A DIS TURBED DISTRICT WITH NEARLY FIXED BOUNDARIES AT A POINT WHERE THERE IS A TENDENCY TO WARDS THE FORMATION OF A FISSURE THE DIRECTION OF THE MAXIMUM RESULTANT TENSION WILL BE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TANGENT TO THE MERIDIAN THE GREATEST TENDENCY TO FORM A FISSURE WILL THEREFORE BE PARALLEL TO THE EQUATOR FROM THE NATURE OF THE VARIABLE PRESSURE THE MAXIMUMR TENSIONS MUST BE EQUAL AT EQUAL DISTANCES FROM THE EQUATOR HENCE SUCH A FISSURE WHEN ONCE COMMENCED WOULD TEND TO BE PROPAGATED ALONG A PARALLEL OF LATITUDE UNTIL THE FORCE OF THE TENSIONS BECOME SUFFICIENTLY LESSENED BY THE SEPARATION OF THE EXTENDED PORTION OF THE SHELL SIMILAR FISSURES WOULD BE FORMED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SYMMETRICALLY AT EACH SIDE OF THE EQUATOR AS LONG AS THE TEN SIONS IN THE DIRECTIONS OF THE TANGENTS TO THE MERIDIANS CONTINUED SUFFICIENTLY GREAT SUCH FISSURES WOULD BE FORMED  BUT AS ALREADY MENTIONED THEIR FORMATION WOULD TEND TO ANNUL THESE TENSIONS AND A NEW SYSTEM WOULD RESULT HAVING A TENDENCY AS MAY BE READILY DEDUCED FROM MR HOPKINSS INVESTIGATIONS TO PRODUCE FISSURES PERPENDICULAR TO THOSE PREVIOUSLY FORMED IF THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY OF THE VARIABLE PRESSURE BE NOT INCONSIDERABLE COMPARED TO THE CONSTANT PRESSURE IT WILL FOLLOW IF THE PRESSURES CONTINUE TO ACT WITH SUFFICIENT ENERGY THAT ALL THE SHELLS FISSURES WILL BE EITHER PARALLEL OR PERPENDICULAR TO THE EQUATOR IF ON THE CONTRARY THE CONSTANT PRESSURE WERE FAR GREATER THAN THE VARIABLE PRES  CAMBRIDGE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS VOL VI 534MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS SURE THE MAXIMUMT AND MINIMUM RESULTANT TENSIONS WOULD BE NEARLY EQUAL AND CON SEQUENTLY THE DIRECTIONS OF THE FISSURES WOULD BE GOVERNED CHIEFLY BY ACCIDENTAL CAUSES TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CAUSES WHICH HAVE BEEN ABSTRACTED IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT THE DIRECTIONS OF THE FISSURES MIGHT IN GENERAL HAVE NO NECESSARY RELA TIONS WITH THAT OF THE EQUATOR IF SUCH A FISSURE COMMENCED FORMING IN THE DIRECTION OF ANY GREAT CIRCLE IT WOULD EVIDENTLY CONTINUE TO BE PROPAGATED IN THE SAME GENERAL DIRECTION UNLESS ACCIDENTAL CAUSES SHOULD ALTER ITS COURSE AT SOME STAGES OF THE SHELLS EXISTENCE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE VARIABLE AND THE CONSTANT PRESSURE MIGHT BE SUCH AS TO CAUSE THE MAXIMUM TENSION AT ANY POINT TO BE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TANGENT OF THE MERIDIAN OR PARALLEL AT THAT POINT AND HENCE IN THIS CASE AT LEAST ALL SIMULTANEOUSLY FORMED FISSURES SHOULD BE PARALLEL THE TERM PARALLEL BEING USED TO MEAN THAT THE TANGENTS TO THE CIRCLES FORMING THE PROLON GATIONS OF THESE FISSURES SHOULD ALL FORM EQUAL ANGLES AT THE POINTS OF INTERSECTION WITH THE TANGENTS OF A GREAT CIRCLE BISECTING THEM VIII ON THE EXISTENCE OF A ZONE OF LEAST DISTURBANCE IN THE SHELL 18 DURING THE PROCESS OF THE FORMATION OF THE SHELL THE FORCES TENDING TO FRACTURE IT AND THOSE HOLDING ITS PARTS TOGETHER WILL IN GENERAL BE CONTINUALLY VARYING IF THE INTENSITY OF THE FORMER CLASS OF FORCES INCREASED MUCH NMORE RAPIDLY THAN THAT OF THE LATTER THERE WOULD BE NO LIMIT TO THE DISTURBED PART OF THE SHELL IF ON THE CONTRARY THE LATTER CLASS OF FORCES INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY IN INTENSITY THAN THE FORMER SOME PARTS OF THE SHELL MIGHT AFTER A CERTAIN TIME BE COMPARATIVELY UNDISTURBED IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE IF THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF THE FLUID AGAINST THE SHELL BE SMALL THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE SHELL THE COHESIVE FORCES KEEPING ITS PARTICLES TOGETHER MIGHT BE ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE RUPTURING FORCES AT THESE PARTS IN ORDER TO FORM A GENERAL IDEA OF THE POSITIONS OF SUCH UNDISTURBED PORTIONS OF THE SHELL THE VARIATION OF THE EFFECTIVE PRESSURE AT ANY POINT IN THE SHELL MUST BE CON SIDERED OF THE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE EFFECTIVE PRESSURE COLLD VARY IN GOING FROM THE EQUATOR TO THE POLE OF THE SHELL IT IS EVIDENT FROM SECTION IV THAT THE ONLY ONE WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER IS THAT OF ITS DECREASE IN THIS CASE WE MAY CONCLUDE FROM ARTICLE 2 THAT THE PRESSURE EVERYWHERE BETWEEN THE EQUATOR AND PARALLEL OF MEAN PRESSURE MUST BE GREATER THAN THAT WHICH EXISTS AT THE SAME PARALLEL AND THAT EVERYWHERE BETWEEN THIS LINE AND THE POLE THE PRESSURE WILL ON THE CONTRARY BE LESS THE DISTURBED PORTION OF THE SHELL MUST THEREFORE BE NEAR THE EQUATOR AND THAT LINE MUST DIVIDE IT INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS IN ORDER THAT AN UNDISTURBED ZONE OF THE SHELL MAY EXIST IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT THE LATTER SHOULD BE PERFECTLY RIGID IT MAY BE CAPABLE OF SUBSIDING BY THE ABSTRACTION OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE PRESSURE OF THE FLUID UNTIL ITS PARTS SHOULD REST IN EQUILIBRIUM WITH A CONSIDERABLE VARIABLE PRESSURE AND A CONSTANT PRESSURE INSUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE FRACTURES IN THE SHELL IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE HOW THIS COULD OCCUR AND HENCE THE MOST GENERAL IDEA WHICH CAN BE FORMED OF THE UNDISTURBED PORTION OF THE SHELL AT EITHER SIDE OF THE EQUATOR IS THAT 3 Z 2 535MR HENNESSYS RESEARCHES IN TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS IT MUST BE A ZONE BOUNDED BY TWO PARALLELS BOTH OF WHICH MAY BECOME COINCIDENT WITH THE EQUATOR OR EVANESCENT ACCORDING AS THE PRESSURES ARE VERY SMALL OR VERY GREAT IF IT BE ADMITTED THAT ANY GREAT DISTURBANCES IN THE SHELL MUST

trust is involved For it is well settled that the power of courts of equity to construe wills will be exercised liberally on behalf of executors trustees or other persons interested in trusts created by will See Christian v Worsham 78 Va 100 Osborne v Taylor 12 Gratt 117 McCrum v Lee 38 W Va 583 18 S E 757 Accordingly as an executor is regarded as a trustee of his testa tors personal property even though no express trust is created by the will equity will entertain suits by executors for the construction of wills of personal property where they would refuse to construe devises of real estate

SameReservationsEffectA stipulation in a deed of trust for the benefit of creditors which after authorizing the trustee to con tinue the business of the grantor reserves to the grantor the power to require the trustee to close up the business and sell the property is not inconsistent with the objects of an assignment for the benefit of creditors and does not render the deed void as fraudulent though a deed reserving power inconsistent with the avowed objects thereof is per se fraudulent Appeal from Circuit Court Bath County Suit by Bowling Spotts  Co against J Graham Davidson and others From a decree for defendants complainant appeals Affirmed J M Perry for appellant Greenlee D Letcher for appellees 4 1908 71313 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER WHITTLE J This appeal is from a decree of the circuit court of Bath county whereby it was adjudged that a deed of trust ex ecuted by the appellee J Graham Davidson for the benefit of cred itors was not fraudulent per se and void The deed is admittedly free from the imputation of fraud in fact and its provisions are characterized by commendable fairness to all parties concerned It includes all the grantors assets and secures all his creditors ratably and contains no clause releasing the debtor from such portions of his indebtedness as may remain undischarged by the trust fund The administration of the trust is confided to a former clerk of the grantor a man of exemplary character and thoroughly familiar with the business It also appears that the grantors mother his largest creditor has agreed to surrender all benefit under the deed to such of the creditors as may accept its terms The fairness of the arrangement is moreover attested by the cir cumstance that out of 50 odd creditors secured by the deed the appellant alone challenges the correctness of the decree The in tention and acts of the grantor give a deed its character and it is apparent that it was the purpose of the appellee who was en gaged in the mercantile business and failed to avoid bankruptcy by making a full and fair surrender of all his assets for the benefit of creditors Though it is true that whether or not a deed is fraudulent as a matter of law that is to say whether it contains some stipula tion irreconcilable with an honest purpose is a question to be de termined by the court from an inspection of the instrument itself it is but just to the grantor that the foregoing statement of un disputed facts be made matter of record The deed empowers the trustee should he deem it to the interest of the creditors to continue the business for six months from its date and if at the end of that time the indebtedness is not paid and it is demonstrated that a continuance of the operation of the business will be to the advantage of the creditors the said trustee may continue to operate the business for six months longer but at any time he shall be requested in writing by any two or more of the creditors holding in the aggregate over 2000 of the debt the said trustee shall forthwith proceed to close up the business with the most practicable dispatch and at any time that the trustee deems it wise or is requested so to do in writing by J Graham Davidson he will proceed to close up the business    sell ing the remainder of the property    as authorized in this deed After the expiration of twelve months after the date hereof the trustee may if he deem it best for the creditors continue the business for twelve months longer or less if requested in writing by J Graham Davidson and creditors holding a majority in amount of the debts secured by this deed Jan 7141908 VA F  M INS CO V J I CASE ETC CO There is striking similarity between this instrument and the deed the validity of which was sustained in Hurst v Leckie 97 Va 550 34 S E 464 75 Am St Rep 798 But it is contended that the differentiating features of the two deeds and the vitiat ing feature of this deed are to be found in the stipulation con tained in the latter reserving to the grantor power at any time to require the trustee to foreclose The law has been settled in this state from the time of the de cision in Lang v Lee 3 Rand 410 that a deed which reserves to the grantor power inconsistent with the avowed object for which the deed is made is per se fraudulent This principle in varying form has repeatedly received the sanction of this court but no case has been cited and we know of none where a deed has been condemned as fraudulent which reserves to the grantor the power to require the trustee at any time to foreclose the deed Surely a reservation the exercise of which must result in an immediate sale of the trust subject and application of the avails to the payment of debts cannot be declared inconsistent with the objects of an assignment for the benefit of creditors or be construed in any just sense as amenable to objection on the ground that it may be used to hinder or delay creditors This precise question has been decided adversely to the view of the appellant in Sipe v Earman 26 Grat 563 and therefore a re view of analogous cases would be unprofitable The court in that case at page 569 observes Nor is the provision which author izes an earlier sale if desired by the grantor repugnant to and in compatible with the avowed object and purpose of the deed so as to render it invalid and void For these reasons we are of opinion that the decree of the cir cuit court is without error andought to be affirmed Affirmed VIRGINIA FIRE  MARINE INS Co T J I CASE THRESHING MACH Co Nov 21 1907 59 S E 369 1

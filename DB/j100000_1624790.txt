qualified for original research PLIOCENE MAN IN BRITAIN GEOLOGICAL readers are aware that the Cromer Forest Beds of eastern England are to be assigned to either the latest Pliocene or oldest Pleistocene They are distinctly preglacial and contain remains of a sub tropical fauna From an article in Natural Science for January it appears that Mr W J Lewis Abbott has collected from these beds a series of chipped flints bearing a striking resem blance to the work of man and have been pronounced to be such by competent ex perts One showed a plain bulb of per cussion As there seems no doubt about their de position with the original strata the only question remaining is their production whether by the hand of man or natural agencies There still remains some doubt even as to the flints from the plateau of Kent on this vital point D G BRINTON UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA NOTES ON INORGANIC CHEMISTRY ON January llth Professor Clemens Winkler of Freiberg delivered an address before the Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft on The Discovery of New Elements during the last twentyfive years and problems connected therewith He first considered the quantitative distribution of the ele ments showing by Professor F W Clarkes tables that as far as concerns the outer ten miles of the earth together with the atmos phere onehalf of all the material is oxygen and onequarter is silicon and that these two elements with aluminum iron cal cium magnesium sodium and potassium make up over 75 per cent None of the remaining elements occur in as great abun dance as one per cent In the process of cooling of the earth and subsequent geo logic action many of the less abundant ele ments have become somewhat localized or concentrated as for example chlorin in the sea and in salt deposits the heavy metals in veins and lodes Were this not the case many of the rarer elements must have escaped detection An instance of this is scandium discovered by Nilson in 1879 of whose oxid but a few grams exist This element and gallium discovered by Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875 and germa nium discovered by Prof Winkler himself in 1886 possess a peculiar interest in that the properties of each had been quite accurately predicted by Mendel6ef in 1871 Their dis covery was a complete confirmation of the principles of the periodic law The mineral gadolinite with others closely kin has been a fertile source of investigation and the list of rare earths  that have been discov ered in it is apparently by no means com plete Erbium holmium thulium dyspro sium terbium gadolinum samarium decip ium and ytterbium have been discov ered by various observers but the independ ent existence of several of these is far from certain Of several supposed new elements the nonexistence is more sure such are metacerium russium jargonium austrium norwegium actinium idumium and mas rium The same may perhaps be said of the recently patented lucium kosmium and neokosmium These last do not derive their appellation from kosmos but from Kos mann their discoverer and patentee Work by Auer von Welsbach on his incan descent light led him to the decomposition of didymium into neodymium and praseo dymium whose beautiful red and green salts were well shown at the Chicago Ex position The last elements considered by Professor Winkler were argon and helium These apparently do not as yet fall into SCIENCE 439N S VOL V No 115 harmony with the periodic system The same may be said of tellurium and cobalt or nickel Whether some or all of these ele ments are mixtures or whether their seem ingly anomalous atomic weights must be explained in some other way does not as yet appear THE action of the silent electric dis charge in effecting chemical synthesis is being studied by Losanitsch and Jovit schitsch at the Konigliche Hochschule at Belgrade The apparatus used is an ordi nary ozonizator or as they prefer to call it electrizator Mixed gases are led through the apparatus exposed to the discharge of a Ruhmkorff excited by a current of 70 volts and three to five amperes Carbon monoxid and water also carbon dioxid and hydrogen are condensed to formic acid carbon dioxid and water yield formic acid and free oxygen carbon monoxid and hy drogen give formaldehyde which quickly polymerizes apparently to a polymer gly colaldehyde Carbon dioxid and methane condense to acetaldehyde which soon forms aldol A general method for formation of aldehydes is thus presented Nitrogen and water condense directly to ammonium nitrite a fact known to Berthelot and con sidered to have a bearing on plant nourish ment Other interesting syntheses were obtained with sulfur compounds and with ammonia In general the reactions seem to be rather the reverse of those produced by heat THE December Zeitschrift fur physikalische Chemie contains a study by Paul and Kronig on the behavior of bacteria towards solu tions of different salts All salts of the same metal do not have the same germicidal effect upon the spores of the anthrax ba cillus used for most of the experiments Thus mercuric chlorid is more deadly than mercuric cyanid Apparently those solu tions containing the largest number of free ions of a metal possessing a specific poi sonous character are most active Mercuric chlorid is more completely dissociated in solution than the cyanid Alkaline chlorids are often used to promote the solution of mercuric chlorid but they also decrease the antiseptic power of the solution since they diminish the dissociation and hence decrease the number of free mercuric ions Dissolved in alcohol mercuric chlorid has practically no effect on anthrax spores J L H SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS REVUE DE MCANIQUE A NOTABLE addition to the list of technical journals has been made in the establishment of this

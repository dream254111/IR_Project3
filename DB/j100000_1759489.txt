which he maintained that the early set tlers of the English NorthAmerican colonies did not leave behind them the experience in the management of local affairs which they had inherited from their ancestors and which formed one of the most precious inheritances of the English race but that they brought such experience to this country and there applied it so far as the peculiar conditions of their environment would permit He further said that he thought the English commonlaw parish of 1600 was the most important connecting link between the institutions of the English race in their two homes and he gave some examples of this connection Dr Charles Deane gave the pith of the argument ad vanced by Judge Aldrich at a recent meeting of the Antiquarian society that the NewEngland town system was but a legislative creation Dr H B Adams said that in his opinion there was not one institution of early New England which did not have its analogue in the institutions of old England and he thought that the author of the paper under discus sion had found the connecting link Judge Cham berlain of the Boston public library endeavored to show that the two theories were not inconsistent and likened the experience that the NewEngland fathers had brought with them to a grain of English wheat which when planted in our soil reproduced its kind so far as circumstances would permit Presi dent White in closing the discussion remarked that he considered the paper an example of the union of the analytic and synthetic methods which he had advocated Mr C H Levermore of Johns Hopkins then read an able essay on the founders of New Haven  John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton who had strength ened class distinctions at the outset in their colony and had created a ruling caste of Brahmins Prof T M Crane of Cornell described some new sources of mediaeval history which he has recently opened up He thought the field would be an attrac tive one both from the large amount of new material and also from the new methods applied to old mate rial such as local traditions popular songs and folk tales which often contained details not to be found in written history A still more curious source was the collections of stories with which the preachers of that time enlivened their sermons each in itself of little value but forming en bloc invaluable material for the historian This new method of study would react most favorably upon the study of our own his tory arid encourage the collection of local traditions folksongs and tales of which an excellent beginning has been made in Allens Slave songs of the South and Newells Songs and games of American children President White spoke of the importance of Profes sor Cranes work and then introduced Dr Francke of Harvard college who described the founding and progress of the Monumenta Germaniae with which he had been associated for two years Justin Winsor closed the session with an account of the Narrative 313 and critical history of America that he is now edit ing and of which two volumes are already printed although not published At a public session in the afternoon Professor Tyler of Cornell presented a rather commonplace and eulogistic paper upon the influence of Thomas Paine on the declaration of independence and Professor Austin Scott  formerly associated with George Bancroftread an essay on the constitutional de velopment of the United States The intense heat interfered with the authors delivery and also with the taking of notes but it may be said that the author maintained that what he termed the federa tive principle was the key to our constitutional his tory and he traced its action with great care and detail through the successive periods of our national growth It is to be hoped that Mr Scott will still further elaborate and publish his paper which showed considerable ability and thought NOTES ON THE ELECTRICAL CON FERENCE THE Electrical conference called together by the commission appointed by the president of the United States met in Philadelphia on Monday Sept 8 and continued its sessions throughout the week The firstmeetings were held in the lecturehall of the Electrical exhibition but on account of the bad acoustic properties of that room the sessions after Tuesday took place in the hall of the Franklin in stitute About one hundred and seventyfive delegates were invited by this commission to be present and con stitute the conference Of these the greater number were American investigators and electricians but a nunber of foreign conferrees were also included Of these it should be mentioned that there were present Sir William Thomson who was also vice president of the conference Professor Fitzgerald of the University of Dublin Professor Oliver Lodge of Liverpool Mr W H Preece of the English postal telegraph Professor Arthur Schuster of Manchester and Professor Silvanus P Thompson of University college Bristol The conference was designed to be representative of all interested in progress in electrical knowledge and so not only were those present who are more concerned with the purely theoretical questions in volved but also those especially occupied in develop ing applications of electricity Prof Simon Newcomb on behalf of the commis sion opened the conference in a brief address of wel come and also stated the objects for which the con ference had been called He was followed by the president of the conference Prof Henry A Row land who delivered a carefully prepared and very interesting address in which were discussed among other things the interdependence of applied and pure science some of the questions still open in electrical science and the need of more careful train ing in the theory of electricity in technical schools SEPTEMBER 26 1884314 SCIE Sir William Thomson then made a short address after which the conference adjourned to meet on Tuesday when the regular discussions were begun The object of the conference was to take authorita tive action respecting the electrical standards recom mended by the international convention to consider the advisability of recommending the establishment by the government of a bureau of physical standards to consider what could be done by the U S signal service with the cooperation of the various telegraph and telephone companies towards increasing our knowledge of atmospheric electricity and earthcur rents and to discuss subjects in which the knowledge possessed by those acquainted with the theory of electricity could be brought to the aid of those en gaged in the applications of the science The senti ment of the conference was in favor of adopting the electrical standards recommended by the interna tional convention which met at Paris last April but as considerable difference of opinion exists as to the best standard of light to be adopted the whole sub ject of the electrical standards was referred to a com mittee which is to report to the commission within three months In the discussion of the adoption of the legal ohm as defined by the Paris convention as the resistance of a column of pure mercury at zero degrees centigrade of one square millimetre cross section and one hundred and six centimetres in length it was brought out that the results obtained in the experiments which have been carried on du ring the past year under Professor Rowlands direc tion give very nearly 10628 centimetres as the length of the column of mercury which represents the true ohm The subject of the best methods of extending our knowledge of atmospheric electricity and earthcur rents and any possible relation that may exist between them and the weather was introduced by Professor Abbe of the signalservice He represented the im portance of the subject and that by using suitable methods and by the cooperation of the various tele phone and telegraph companies much valuable in formation might be obtained and without interfering with the regular work of the lines employed Sir William Thomson called attention to the fact that in the study of earthcurrents the quantity to be meas ured is the difference of potential between the points of observation By such measurements the distri bution of potential at any time over the country exam ined may be mapped and studied The question of the establishment of a bureau of physical standards was introduced by Professor Snyder who pointed out the advantages which would result from having physical standards preserved and verified under government supervision Work which is now being done by different observers all over the country and in a way which is often necessarily incomplete from the lack of funds could thus be done at a central laboratory more cheaply effectively and accu rately and thus the physicists now engaged in these laborious determinations and comparisons would be free to occupy themselves with investigations looking to the discovery of new truth In the discussion NC  VOL IV No 86 which followed Professor Rogers of Cambridge Mass urged that the bureau should engage in auxil iary research and showed how this was necessary for the accurate establishment of units Lieut Allen of the signalservice read a paper giving an account of the success that had attended the work of that depart ment in obtaining accurate standards for thermome try and barometry Professor Hilgard superintendent of the U S coastsurvey was not in favor of such a bureau on the ground that it would discourage pri vate research and that the present bureau of weights and measures met every requirement Professor Simon Newcomb spoke in favor of the proposed bu reau and Sir William Thomson not only favored the idea but thought that instruments of the accuracy required by such a bureau for its work would soon be devised and constructed and the time was there fore ripe for such action to be taken Finally the conference adopted a resolution to the effect that it deemed it of national importance that Congress should fix standards of electrical measures and establish a bureau charged with the duty of examining and veri fying instruments for electrical and other physical measurements The commission was urged to bring the matter before congress and it was left with them to decide upon the manner of the carryingout of the idea whether by a special bureau or by enlarging the powers and duties of existing departments Among the discussions that occupied the attention of the cornference perhaps the most interesting one was that opened by Prof Henry A Rowland upon the theory of the dynamoelectric machine Professor Rowland maintained that neglecting the question of strength and rigidity and other such mechanical reasons a single magnetic circuit is better than a double one meaning by a single magnetic circuit such a one as would be obtained by placing the armature between the poles of an ordinary horse shoe magnet and by a double magnetic circuit one of the form obtained by putting two horseshoe magnets end to end with their similar poles together and put ting the armature between the compound north and south poles thus formed In the single circuit the lines of force after passing through the armature can only return in one way through the magnet in the double circuit however the lines of force can return by passing around either through one magnet or the other Professor Rowland is of the opinion that there is far more leakage of the lines of force in the case of the double circuit than in the case of the single and therefore other things being equal the single circuit is the better form This is however a ques tion that should be investigated by experiment Both forms of dynamo should be carefully examined to determine the amount of leakage at every point Such an investigation would be very important Professor Rowland also advocated the use of magnets of cylindrical section rather than flat or oval magnets on the ground that the least amount of wire would then be used to produce the required magnetization of a given mass of iron Professor Silvanus P Thomson differed on this point and preferred iron cores of oval section giving as his reason that he had found v IsIr I  f liSEPTEMBER 26 1884 SCIE by actual experiment that the central part of an iron core was not nearly so powerfully magnetized as the outer part Professor Rowland called attention to the fact that Professor Thompsons experiments had been made with short straight iron magnets where the resistance of the air to the magnetic lines of force came in as the most important factor and therefore had led Professor Thompson into error but that since in the dynamo the only airspaces hre those between the armature and the pole pieces it closely resembles a ring magnet where the magnetic circuit is completed in the iron itself and therefore as in the ring magnet the iron in the centre of the core of the magnets of the dynamo is quite as important as that on the outside Professor Fitzgerald of Dublin showed that the loss due to selfinduction in the armature is propor tional to the linear velocity and length of the coils Professor Silvanus P Thompson of Bristol called attention to the fact that whenever a coil is shortcir cuited there is a real loss of energy in heat and there fore it is bad to set two brushes one a little ahead of the other to reduce sparking for this prolongs the time during which the single coils are shortcir cuited He also noticed that since selfinduction is increased in proportion to the increase in the velocity of the armature or to the increase in the number of turns of wire which it contains higher electromotive force is to be best obtained by strengthening the mag netic field The speaker then referred to the great importance of using the best soft iron in the field magnets instead of cast iron stating that an English maker had nearly doubled the capacity of a machine by substituting for its old castiron magnets and pole pieces new ones made of best forged iron Professor Thompson even went so far as to say that in his opinion it was important that the grain of the iron should run in the same direction as the lines of mag netic force The speaker also objected to the use of large masses of iron in the magnets on the ground that the great time required for such masses to come to their full degree of magnetization interfered with their government Professor Elihu Thomson on the other hand stated that when the iron masses were small the extra current from the machine had so high an electromlotive force as to make trouble and when the machine was used for arclights even caused a sort of vibration in their intensity Prof F E Nipher of Washington University St Louis opened the discussion of the electrical trans mission of energy by a discussion of the case of two dynamos one being used as a generator and one as a motor He showed that the performance of such a system could be advantageously studied by a series of three surfaces in each surface two of the variables being the speeds of the two machines and the third variable being in the three surfaces respectively the work supplied to the generator the work done by the motor and the efficiency of the system as indi cated by the ratio of these two quantities of work The question of storagebatteries was discussed at considerable length Mr W H Preece of London opened by a paper upon the subject giving his expe NCE 315 rience in the use of cells of the Plant6 form He has these cells in his house using electricity not only for lighting but in many other ways The cells are charged for two hours every day by a dynamo ma chine but he hopes when the cells are in a little better condition than now to have to charge them only once a week Each cell is made up of twelve sheets of lead about a foot square and separated by thin sheets of hard rubber punched full of holes the alternate plates are joined together thus forming two sets of six plates each Professor Dewar of Cambridge England gave an account of the chemis try of the storagecell which was of very great inter est There was considerable general discussion upon the subject of the storagebattery and there still seems to be much to be cleared up in regard to its action The chemical actions are by no means simple The subject of longdistance telephony and the difficulties that attend it was introduced by Mr T D Lockwood who in a long and interesting paper gave the results of a great deal of experience with long telephone lines Some interesting points were brought out The noises on telephonelines arise not only from electrostatic and electrodynamic induction but also from earthcurrents and atmospheric elec tricity imperfect contacts and leakage from other lines Long lines are of course more subject to these troubles than short ones and lines running north and south are more subject to disturbance than those running east and west Sometimes one end of a line will be noisy and the other quiet as between Chicago and Milwaukee where the Chicago end is very quiet but the Milwaukee terminal is very noisy Lines subject to pretty uniform leakage are less noisy than wellinsulated ones perhaps for this reason lines near the sea are quieter than those inland Lines on high or mountainous land are subject to periodic storms the noises being most intense at cer tain hours of the day Lines constructed of wire of high conductivity are less noisy than those of greater resistance Lines of small wire thus having less electrostatic capacity are less noisy than lines of large wire A good method of treating a noisy line is to provide a metallic returncircuit hung parallel to the first and similarly to it Many of the sources of disturbance will thus be gotten rid of In case of a long airline ending in a short underground cable the person at the end of the cable can make himself heard at the other end of the line but the man at the end of the long line can not make himself heard For short lines less than two miles in length cables of insulated wire covered with tinfoil this covering being grounded are useful and get rid of some sources of disturbance but on account of the large capacity of such a line the retardation is very great Professor Fitzgerald who was expecting to give an abstract of the paper read by Lord Rayleigh before the British association on the subject of longdis tance telephony had been obliged to leave so no complete presentation of Lord Rayleighs results could be obtained but Professor Rowland made a brief statement of the nature of the problem that316 SCIT the passage of the wavecurrent propagating the tele phonic action was exactly similar to the sinking of the heatwaves into the earth treated by Fourier and by reasoning from the nature of that wave propa gation he concluded that the sound of a deep bass voice could be heard farther than that of a high pitched voice Mr Lockwood said that experience in oceancable telegraphy confirmed this Professor Carhart stated that Lord Rayleigh had from similar considerations calculated the farthest distance at which telephonic comrmunication could be main tained in such a cable as the Atlantic cable and gives the extreme limit as twenty miles This is fully confirmed by experience according to the testi mony of Messrs Preece and Lockwood Capt 0 E Michaelis of the Frankford arsenal read a paper in which he recommended the study of the structural metals iron copper brass etc by electrical or magnetic methods with a view to ascer taining whether some such methods could not be de vised that should detect weaknesses not otherwise to be discovered A short discussion then took place on the measure ment of large currents in which there was nothing particulary interesting brought out Professor Rowland then took up the subject of lightning protection and gave a short development of Maxwells suggestion that the house s  ld be placed in a metallic cage A house in a complete metallic cage one enclosing it below as well as above would be completely protected if the wires of the cage were sufficiently good conductors This fact leads to the following considerations Lightning rods should run down the four corners of the house and across the angles of the roof joining at the top thus forming the skeleton of a cage If rods are also run down the middle of the sides of the house or if in a long building two or three equidistant rods are run down the sides and connected with the PJ NCE VOL IV No 86 rods running across the roof so much the better These rods must be well grounded otherwise they are of no use at all and may be worse than useless for suppose the gaspipes running through the house have good earth connections the lightning will be likely to leap from the rods to the gaspipes and so cause destruction The rods down the sides should therefore be connected by rods running across under the building as well as by those over the roof and the gas and water pipes as well as all large masses of metal in the building should be connected with the rods by good conductors It is of course necessary that the rods should be of good conducting material solid not hollow As it is important that the rods should have a large crosssection the twisted forms with large surface and very little mass of metal are not good as there is no use in the twisting and the most important thing is that there should be plenty of metal to conduct There is not the slightest necessity for insulating a lightningrod the safety of a building depends only on its being easier for the lightning to go around it than to go through it Of course from the cage of rods above described small rods bearing points are to rise at different points on the roof How high these should be or how close together is not very well determined It is con sidered by some that a rod protects the space in cluded in the cone whose height is that of the rod and the radius of whose base is also equal to the length of the rod Others think that a space is protected equal to the cone whose height is that of the rod and whose base has a radius of twice that amount The time for adjournment having come the con ference adjourned subject to the call of the chair man Professor Rowland who is also president of the commission It is possible that there may be another session in Philadelphia about the close of November BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE AD VANCEMENT OF SCIENCE PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECTION OF ANTHROPOLOGY THE admirable survey of the progress of anthro pological science comprised in the address made by Dr Tylor as president of the section was listened to with great satisfaction by the members In this as sociation as in the American anthropology has been late in finding the recognition which its importance as a science deserves Heretofore it has been treated as a department of the biological section As the communications have gradually taken a wider range and become more numerous it was found that this subordinate status was inconvenient At the present meeting anthropology for the first time takes the rank of a section and with a fortunate choice of officers the vicepresidents being Professors Boyd Dawkins and Dr Daniel Wilson and the secretaries Messrs G W Bloxam recorder Rev J Campbell Walter Hurst and J M P Lemoine Among the papers which attracted most attention may be ranked that of Professor Boyd Dawkins on the range of the Eskimo in space and time In this paper Professor Dawkins again urged with much in genuity and force his wellknown opinions as to the probability that the Eskimos are the survivors of the prehistoric race known in Europe as the cave dwellers The Eskimos are found along the Arctic Ocean from Labrador and Greenland to the west coast and thence extendingr into Asia Everywhere they appear to be a receding race gradually retreat ing northward as they are pressed by stronger and more warlike tribes in America by the Indians in Asia by the Mongols The researches of Mr Dall had produced evidence that they formerly dwelt on the west coast of America far south of their present

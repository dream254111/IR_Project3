during its recent ses sion JanuaryMarch 1902 passed an act for the cooperative insurance of employees engaged in certain dangerous occupa tions against injuries resulting in death While the law is confessedly tentative and narrowly restricted in its scope it is noteworthy because it introduces a new principle into Ameri can labor legislation In the United States attention has been given heretofore to modifying the common law rules as to negligence The Maryland act goes further and following the lines marked out by foreign legislation Provides for the indemnification of all injuries resulting in death irrespective of cause It is recognized that the burden of the trade risk should not fall primarily on the workman At the same time also a practically compulsory system of insurance against such injuries is created The law hinges on the conditional abrogation of the  fellow servant rule It is provided that a ny corporation com pany partnership association individual or individuals en gaged in the business of operating any coal or clay mine quarry steam or street railroad in the State of Maryland and any incorporated town city or county engaged in the work of constructing any sewer excavation or other physical struct ure or the contractors for any such town city or county shall be liable in law to any employee engaged in the above named occupations or in case of death to his wife    for the damages flowing from an injury to said employee or from the death of such employee when such injury or death is caused by the negligence of the employer or by the negligence of any servant or employee of such employer By the opera tion of this section of the act the liability of employers is greatly increased since heretofore the negligence of a fellow servant has not been ground for a damage suit in Maryland The remainder of the act offers to employers a method by which they may escape this increased liability for damages592 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS It is believed that they will prefer to comply with the require ments of the other sections of the law rather than to run the risk of having to make large payments for damages If however employers do not avail themselves of this alternative the result will be the abrogation of the fellowservant rule in the specified trades In order to be relieved from liability to their employees for damages employers in the industries included under the act must pay into the hands of the State Insurance Commissioner the following sums  Annual Payment per Employee Coal and clay mining              180 Steam railroads                300 Street railroads and trolleys            060 Municipal works        Amount to be fixed by commissioner Onehalf of the amount paid by an employer may be de ducted by him from the wages of the employee  In the event of the death of an employee insured under this act who shall have come to his or her death in the course of the employ ment and by causes arising therein provided such death shall not have occurred at a period longer than one year from the date of the injury then the Insurance Commissioner upon being satisfied by adequate evidence of such death shalll pay to the administrator or executor of the deceased or unto the widow or husband or children of the deceased as the said Insurance Commissioner shall deem wisest for the defendants if there be any the sum of one thousand dollars and shall pay such indemnification for no other reason or cause whatsoever The number of workmen covered by the act is small Ac cording to the census of 1890 the persons engaged in the occupations named in the law amounted to probably 12000 divided among the trades as follows Mining         4093 Street railroads 923 Steam railroads      6589 Municipal works   Not given The total number at the present time probably does not exceed 15000 The Insurance Commissionier may exempt from the provisions of the act those employers who give satisfactory evidence that they are already and will conNOTES AND MEMORANDA 593 tintie making better provisions for the workmen employed either by way of payments in case of death injury sickness or old age or all combined and are contributing more in such manner to the said workmen than    they   would be obliged to do under the insurance provisions hereof Both the Baltimore  Ohio and the Pennsylvania Railroads have insurance systems for the benefit of their employees and if the Insurance Commissioner decides that these the largest employers of railroad operatives in the State are exempt from the requirements of the law the number of workmen insured under the act will probably not exceed 10000 On the other hand the commissioner is authorized to extend the insurance sections of the act to other trades but he cannot chance the liability of employers in such industries and since the increase in liability is the vital force in the law it cannot be expected that many employers will voluntarily insure their workmen The law is open to criticism in a number of directions A workman insured under the law and severely but not fatally injured not only has no claim for compensation from the insurance fund but his case is somewhat worse than formerly since under the present law such a workman will no longer have a right of action even if his injury has been caused by the negligyence of his employer While very few injuries received by employees can be made the basis of successful action against employers the removal of all fear of such suits cannot but have the effect of causing employers to be more negligent of the safety of their work men The system of assessment provided for in the law gives no encouragement to employers to be careful that their work men shall not be injured All employers in an industry pay into the insurance fund at the same rate Under the English Workmens Compensation Act the liability for the indemnifi cation of injuries falls directly on the employer Also under the Austrian law for the insurance of workmen against injuries the employers are classified within each trade according to the risk and a higher insurance premium exacted from those  This is seemingly the intent of the act but no case has been passed upon by the courts and it is possible that it may be held that payments to the insurance fund do not release employers from liability in such cases594 QUARTERLY JO URNAL OF ECONOMICS employers whose works are conducted without proper safe guards In both cases there is a strong inducement to em ployers to adopt adequate precautions for the safety of their men Mine and factory inspection laws are well supplemented by such appeals to individual interest The prevention of the loss of lives is as much a matter of economic concern as the indemnification of such loss when it occurs The provisions for the maintenance of the insurance fund are illconsidered The intent of the law seems to be that the receipts and payments shall balance each year and this prin ciple would be a correct one if the base were sufficiently large but the number of the insured is probably too small to furnish even an approximately regular number of deaths from year to year A single accident in the coal mining industry may involve the loss of the lives of many workmen and a serious mishap of this character might deplete the fund for several years It would have been more in accord with sound insurance principles to have provided specifically for a large reserve fund But despite these imperfections in the law the position of the workman looked at from the standpoint of practical pro tection is undoubtedly better than under the legislation formerly existing The act went into effect July 1 and has not yet been before the courts Its success and perhaps the success of such legislation in general in America will depend very largely on the view the courts take of it The operation of the act will be watched with interest by all of those who so long have advocated the shifting of the burden of the trade risk from the laborer to the industry GEORGE E BARNETT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY

reflection or vortex mo tion I omit divergency because the only functions I can find connected with divergency which would prevent discontinuity either van ish at a short distance from the source or only exist at the lateral edges of the wave and hence do not affect spherical waves Now in a fluid like the ether viscosity hysteresis and heat conduction losses can not occur Nor if my work is correct can reflec tion occur without vortex motion and then not necessarily But the vortex motion is a necessity in a fluid like the ether whenever a spherical wave reaches a certain distance from its source And gravitational waves must therefore give rise to vortices in the ether And the satisfactory point about these vor tices is that they are exactly similar irrespec tive of the intensity of the gravitational wave and dependent only upon the elasticity and density of the medium This therefore relieves us of the necessity of assuming a single vor tex filament There are some points still to be cleared up For example one might anticipate that the ro tational velocity of the vortices would be the same as the translational velocity of the wave but there appear to be at least one and pos sibly two other types with rotational veloci ties of the square and cube root of the wave velocity also in some respects the motion of what I have called the oscilla appear to differ from that of our standard vortex filament All this is at present rather hard to interpret but doubtless as the difficulties of the analysis are gradually overcome we shall be able to visual ize the system more clearly As the work is still under way the above re sults would not have been published but for the fact that it appears to have been generally assumed at the last British Association meet ing that Plancks  quanta  theory and Max wells continuous medium theory are mutually exclusive and that one or the other must be given up Now the results referred to above show that this is not so but that every con tinuous medium theory must involve quanta and we might almost say that a continuous medium begins to count as soon as it gets its legs A unit quantity is therefore just as natural a thing as a flux and in this connec tion it is interesting to note how from Newton and Leibnitz down to Maxwell and Planck the English mind runs always to continuities and fluxes and the German to quanta and infini tesimals It may also be pointed out that quanta are a necessary consequence of motion due to cen tral attraction One visible example of this is the gaps in Saturns rings These are due to satellite resonance but I have found that nucleus resonance gives quanta6 whether the resonant nucleus be the sun or the positive electron The latter case is much the simpler as all the corpuscles are the same size and so what we may call the quanta orbits are simpler From the above it will be seen that the problem of the transmission of plane waves in a frictionless fluid is not as has been generally assumed a matter of no practical importance and of interest to pure mathematicians only But that it is a matter of very great practical importance and that the complete solution of the problem is of capital importance in many fields from the design of aeroplanes and the calculation of frictional resistance of ships to the theory of the constitution of the ether and the structure of the positive charge REGINALD A FESSENDEN THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF SILT1 IN a report recently published by the De partment of State entitled  Silt in the Rio Grande certain fundamental ideas are pro mulgated concerning the specific gravity of silt which seemed to the writer incorrect and of sufficient importance to be worthy of a brief note in SCIENCE The author W W Follett consulting engi neer of the

engineer commission for the equitable distribution of the waters of the Rio Grande takes up the problem of how much space a given weight of riverborne silt will occupy when deposited in a reservoir saying on pages 11 and 12 It was evident that the per cent of bulk ob tained from test tubes would be too large for the desired unit because there was no weight on the silt in the tube to compact it as there would be in a reservoir  Something more than guesswork was wanted It did not seem proper to us to found all our silt calculations on an assumed bulk for it which was as it were simply pulled out of the air The de sire was to approximate as closely as possible to the conditions which would be found in the bot tom of a reservoir After considering various schemes to all of which there seemed to be valid objections it was finally decided to seek a mud bar in the river where the water had been com paratively still and which had shrunk enough to show material cracks and to cut from this bar a threeinch cube have it dried out and weighed and to abide by the result whatever it was The idea was that a bar should be chosen which had shrunken enough to make up for the compression which the silt in the bottom of a reservoir would undergo from the weight of the water over it Of course the necessary amount of shrinkage could not be told exactly but it was thought that a fairly good guess could be made The threeinch cube was collected dried and found to weigh 85 per cent as much as a threeinch cube of water It was therefore assumed that the above experiment fairly determined the weight of reservoir silt and that all silt determinations should be divided by 085 in order to obtain the actual final vol ume of the silt The collection of the three inch cube of silt is further described on page 75 of the report The first idea which seems incorrect is that deep water through its greater weight makes deposited silt more compact than shallow water If the pores are filled with water the pressure must be equal in all directions and the individual particles of silt being practi cally incompressible the weight of the water must have negligible effect on the compact ness of the silt If the pores are not filled with water but contain some air or other gas the material would be compressed in propor tion to the quantity of gas and the amount of pressure but it does not seem probable that the compactness of silt is in general greatly affected by compression of included gases It seems more reasonable to suppose that any greater compactness displayed by silt de posited in deep water is due to the arrange ment of the particles or a modification of their form brought about by the great dis tance traversed in settling and especially is this true unless it can be shown that such silt expands when taken out of the water The second somewhat surprising idea is that one threeinch cube furnishes a better basis for determining the specific gravity of Rio Grande silt than all other available data both inferential and experimental If this be correct there is certainly great need of adding to the available data for the determination concerning the threeinch cube seems to be a small foundation for the argument and hun dreds of computations which are based upon them The result obtained namely that silt free from water weighs only 53 pounds per cubic foot is considerably below most esti mates and means that the material has a pore space of nearly 68 per cent E W SHAW ON PSYCHOLOGY AND MEDICAL EDUCATION 1 FOLLOWING the symposium on psychology 1eport of the Committee of

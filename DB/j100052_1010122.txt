j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1010122,The Neutralization of the Suez Canal,i242542,THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL The Turkish Sultan Mustapha III is reported to have once remarked  If a happy circumstance can dictate altera tions in immutable laws the canal from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean will one day become the basis of a new rule of international law Mustaphas words were truly pro phetic for to the student of international law and its history the case of the Suez Canal presents an interesting and impor tant example of the adaptation of the rules of international jurisprudence to altered conditions and changed circum stances For up to the third quarter of the last century jurists were almost entirely silent regarding the legal status of artificial canals connecting two seas and utilized by the public and private vessels of several states They have discussed alone the legal necessities of existing condi tions and consequently have had no occasion to deal with cases which under thenexisting conditions could not arise The Suez Canal was at the time of its construction a work so unique that it would be idle to consult the file of pre cedence in the hope of finding precept or rule such as would throw any light upon its legal position But no small por tion of the present body of international law has had its origin in the continual extension of simple principles to complex cases and in the detection of analogies between new and old sets of facts The great but simple rules of Hugo Grotius respecting the freedom of the high seas have in later centuries received applications of which their author could have had no conception The Congress of Vienna for example applied the principle to the chief rivers of North eastern Europe declaring that the Rhine Meuse Scheldt Moselle and Elbe should be free to the vessels of all nations from the point at which they became navigable down to the sea thus putting an end to the mass of vexatious regula 40914 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY tions and tolls which had hitherto rendered them practi cally useless as highways of trade Similarly the principle of the immunity of noncombatant territory and of non combatant persons has been extended to render immune certain works of international importance such as the arti ficial entrances at the mouths of the Danube while the Geneva Convention applied the principle of immunity to surgeons nurses and others whose intimate connection with combatants had hitherto deprived them of a neutral char acter Political necessities too had at various times secured the perpetual immunity of whole states such as Luxemberg Belgium and Switzerland The step from an international agreement for the immunity from hostile attack of territories works and persons to an agreement for the guarantee of like immunity to an inter oceanic waterway of the greatest political and commercial importance to many states was not a long one and the Suez Canal had not been many years in operation when a move ment with this end in view began But movements of this kindowing to the number and variety of the interests con cernedprogress very slowly and it was not until nearly two decades had passed that international agreement finally secured for the great waterway a full guarantee of immunity from belligerent operations under all circumstances whatso ever And in view of the frequency with which during the recent discussions upon the HayPauncefote negotiations the action of the Powers in regard to the Suez Canal has been seized upon and advanced as a precedent it may be well to examine the history both of the canal construction and of the subsequent international negotiations with a view to discovering whether or not all the essentials of a valid pre cedent are present The importance commercially and strategically of a navi gable waterway across the Isthmus of Suez had long been recognized As early as I798 Bonaparte had caused the route to be surveyed but his engineers reported the scheme 41oTHE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL 15 impracticable giving as their reason that the Red Sea level was some thirty feet above that of the Mediterranean and the project was consequently dropped But about half a century later a new survey served to show the complete inaccuracy of its predecessor and a project for the construc tion of a canal was once more put forward There was moreover another circumstance which rendered the pros pects for the successful construction of such a work much more favorable than heretoforethe increased strength and stability of the Egyptian government From the beginning of the century the political affairs of Egypt had never been satisfactory On the departure of the French forces Mehemet Ali had seized the reins of government and had in time been able to wring from the Sultan a more or less indefinite recog nition of the authority which he had established in the country Proving a successful ruler Mehemet kept up a considerable military establishment by means of which he was able to make important extensions of his territory The Sultan embarrassed with the Greek revolt was unable to prevent these extensions until after the definite cession of Grecian independence when an endeavor to curtail the powers of the Egyptian Pascha led to an open rupture The Porte had however underestimated Mehemets military resources and the complete assertion of Egyptian inde pendence was in 1832 only prevented by the intervention of Europe But the Pascha conscious of Turkish weakness continued his aggressions till I840 when he was definitely warned that the Powers would under no conditions allow the existence of a new independent Arab empire in the Levant In that year Lord Palmerston instructed the British agent at Cairo to warn Mehemet Ali that Great Britain would aid the Sultan in preventing any further extension of the Paschalic powers and that orders had been given to the British fleet in this regard In this move 1 Correspondence relating to the affairs of the Levant Parliamentary Papers I841 Part I p 502 Part II pp 5 I8i 4IIl6 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Great Britain seems to have merely acted as spokesman for the other Powers since the principles of international policy embodied in Lord Palmerstons despatch were fully carried into execution by the convention of London in I840 whereby Great Britain Austria Prussia and Russia agreed to protect the Porte by coercive measures if necessary against aggres sion on the part of the Egyptian government Accordingly Mehemct threw overboard his greater ambitions and in I84I received from the Sultan a firman which laid down specifically the limits of his territories and powers This firman which though several times since amended is still the legal basis of the khedival power in Egypt was likewise submitted to the Powers and approved by them it being at the same time understood that amending firmans should receive the same approval before going into effect Some years later Lord Clarendon informed the British agent at Cairo  that the great Powers would not allow the Porte to abrogate or diminish the authority of the Khedive without their consent while likewise they would prevent any attempt on the part of the Khedive to extend his authority without Turkish permission Thus it was not till I840 that the legal status of Egypt had become definitely fixed under the guarantee of the Powers hence it was only then that the obtaining of a reliable charter to execute a great public work such as that of a canal across the Isthmus of Suez became for the first time possible During the course of the forties elaborate surveys were made and in the early fifties definite proposals for the construction of the canal began to be put forward Negotiations with the Khedive were undertaken by the French engineer M de Lesseps and on January 5 I856 these were concluded through the issue of a firman by the terms of which de Lesseps was given power to form a company to be called  La Compagnie Universelle du Canal de Suez and to proceed with the work The influence of Great Britain had throughout the course of the negotiations been 412THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL 17 thrown against the proposals as Lord Palmerston deemed that the construction of the canal would be very detrimental to British political and commercial interests That it did not ultimately prove so was due no more to British com mercial enterprise than to the lack of this quality among the people of certain continental countries who otherwise might have turned the new route to their own advantage By the terms of the charter of I856 the company was given certain territorial concessions for a period of ninety nine years was guaranteed the free use of a large amount of forced labor on the part of the fellaheen and was given certain rights in regard to the construction of subsidiary freshwater canals and works In return the company was under obligation to execute the whole project at its own expense the Egyptian government to be given when the canal was in full operation 15 per cent of the net annual earnings the original shareholders 75 per cent and the pro motors the remaining o1 per cent On the expiration of the period for which the charter was granted the canal with all its appurtenances was to become the property of the Egyptian government And by Article 14 of the charter the right of free navigation under equal conditions was guaranteed to the ships of all nations It was this article which some years later was utilized by de Lesseps in an endeavor to prove that the canal had been  neutralized  by the terms of the companys charter The terms of the charter were deemed satisfactory and the work of construction com menced But at this point the Sultan stepped in and declared that those clauses in the charter which had made concessions of territory and which had placed the forced labor of the fellaheen at the companys disposal were ultra 1 We solemnly declare for ourselves and our successors that the Grand Maritime Canal from Suez to Pelusium and its dependent ports shall be open forever as neutralpassages to all ships of commerce passing from one sea to the other with out any distinction exclusion or preference of persons or nationalities on pay ment of the dues and compliance with the regulations established by the Conces sionary Universal Company for the use of the said canal and its dependencies 41318 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY vires of the Khedive This turn in affairs caused a suspen sion of operations the company making claim against the Egyptian government for damages consequent upon a breach of contract However the matter was submitted by both parties to Napoleon III with the result that the Khedive was adjudged liable to pay the sum of 3360ooo indem nity The original capital of the company had been fixed at 8oooooo of which sum the Khedive had himself sub scribed about threeandahalf millions the balance being taken up by the various European financial houses iln 20 shares But by the time the canal was formally opened in I869 successive issues had brought the total capital up to more than 17oooooo The opening of what M Gambetta called  the carotid artery  between East and West was an event of great inter nrtional importance more especially to such of the European Powers as had territorial and commercial interests in Asia Prominent among such was Great Britain the government of which was not slow in realizing that the control of the canal by any other Power would constitute a grave menace to India During the course of the FrancoPrussian war of i87071 no attempt was made by either Power to engage in belligerent operations within the limits of its waterway or ports but the danger of such was nevertheless made appar ent and in 1873 an International Commission summoned at Constantinople on the invitation of the Sultan agreed upon the general principle that the navigation of the canal should at all times be equally enjoyed by the vessels of all nations This declaration 614 December 1873 was accepted by the Porte by the president of the canal com pany and by the Powers but it in no wise specifically pro hibited belligerent acts within the waters of the canal and its approaches nor did it serve to secure the waterway against a blockade in case the territorial power should become a belligerent The inadequacy of the declaration was furthermore demonstrated in 1875 when complications 414THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL arose leading to a threat on the part of the companywhich was entirely under French controlof closing the canal temporarily to all vessels a threat which would probably have been carried into effect but for the prompt action of the Egyptian authorities In view of this situation the policy of the British government directed itself towards the obtaining of a controlling interest in the company through the purchase of shares and on November 25 I875 Disraeli played what proved to be a masterstroke in this direction by buying out for the sum of 4000000 the shares held by the Khedive This action on the part of the English minister was soundly criticised at home and roundly ridiculed abroad but both politically and financially the investment proved a wise one for the purchase made Great Britain the largest individual shareholder in the company thus giving that Power an undeniable right to a voice in the general management of the canal while at the same time the shares have greatly risen in marketable value Not long after this time the RussoTurkish war of 1877 began and there appeared a grave danger that the Medi terranean entrance to the canal would be blockaded by the Russian fleet Anticipating such an eventuality the British authorities informed the governments of Russia Turkey and Egypt that any attempt to blockade or to otherwise inter fere with the canal or its approaches would be regarded by Her Majesty as a menace to India and as a grave injury to the commerce of the world Further the British note declared  that Her Majestys government are firmly deter mined not to permit the canal to be made the scene of any combat or other warlike operations 1 In reply Prince Gortchakoff declared that Russia did not propose to blockade interrupt or menace the canal in any way but that on the contrary the Russian government considered the canal to be  an international work of such importance Derby to Lyons Parliamentary Papers June 5 1877 The Times June 6 1877 415 I920 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY to the commerce of the world that it should remain untouched It was this danger and the attitude of Great Britain in regard thereto which led de Lesseps as president of the canal company to seize the moment as an opportune one for laying before the British ministry a project for the perma nent protection of the freedom of the canal by an interna tional agreement He accordingly proposed to Lord Derby that the government of Great Britain should invite the chief Powers of Europe to give assent to the following decla ration International Agreements as to the Passage of Ships of War through the Suez Canal Since the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 the com plete liberty of passage through the Maritime Canal and the ports connected with it has been respected for state vessels as well as for merchant ships even on the part of belligerent Powers at the time of the FrancoPrussian war The governments of    now agree to maintain the same liberty to all national and commercial vessels whatever may be their flag and without any exception it being understood that national ships will be subject to the measures which the territorial authority may take to prevent ships in transit from embarking on Egyptiatn territory any troops or munitions of war The British Ministry did not however receive this pro posal favorably for after due consideration reply was made to de Lesseps  that the scheme proposed for the neuraliza tion of the canal by an international convention was open to so many objections of a political and practical character that they could not undertake to recommend it for the support of the Porte and the Powers Lord Derby some little time later proposed to the French government that the public vessels of France and Great Britain should jointly patrol the canal and its approaches during the course of hostilities 416THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL and this plan not commending itself to the authorities of the former Power the Italian foreign office made suggestion of a temporary patrol by a fleet composed of vessels detached for this purpose by all the Powers As a matter of fact the canal was not blockaded during the course of the RussoTurkish war but it would be diffi cult to deny that if Russiaagainst whom the Khedive had furnished a quota of troops to the Ottoman armyhad deemed fit to adopt this method of inflicting an injury upon a belligerent she would have been quite within her rights at international law in so doing1 The position assumed by Great Britain restedas Sir Robert Phillimore has shown upon no other basis than that of political and commercial selfinterest together with her ability as the predominant naval power to make her dicta in the matter respected It is true that the charter of concession to the canal com pany January 5 1856 had guaranteed the neutral passage of the canal to all ships of commerce without distinction of flag But that the Egyptian government had not even as between the company and itself contemplated the immunity of the canal from hostile operations may be seen by reference to another article in the charter Art Io wherein it was provided that the military authorities of Egypt should have at all times the right to occupy strategic positions on the canal banks Furthermore no government couldeven if it so desiredhave divested itself of any of the responsi bilities of belligerency through a private contract with a chartered company The Declaration of Constantinople December I4 1873 likewise provided for the equal not for the free use of the canal by the ships of all nations and the existence of a blockade shutting out all vessels alike would have been in no sense a violation of the principle of equality which the Declaration enjoined This latter had not prevented the canal company from preparing to make good its threat to close the waterway in I875 1Phillimore Principles of International Law Vol I p 155 417 2122 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY But the dangers of I877 showed clearly enough the advisa bility of some concerted action in the direction of neutraliza tion although as to how such should be effected was by no means so clear So important did the latter question appear to the jurists of Europe that the Institut du droit Interna tionale at its annual meeting in Zurich at once appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Sir Travers Twiss to consider the best possible method of securing the immunity of the canal from hostile operations At the annual meeting of the Institut held in Paris during the course of the fol lowing year this committee reported but so much discussion arose over the exact import of the word  neutralization  that the Institute contented itself with expressing in general terms its opinion that it is in the interest of all nations that the Suez Canal be declared by an international act free of any hostile attempt during war reserving the details for future consideration In 1879 a further report was sub mitted by the committee in which four main principles were advanced I That the Powers are agreed that complete freedom of passage through the canal should be always respected by belligerents in the case of ships of war as well as private vessels 2 That no troops or munitions of war should be landed along the canal without the consent of the territorial Power 3 That should the territorial Power be at war a reason able time should be allowed to the trading vessels of the enemy to leave the canal 4 That the neutrality of the canal ought to be respected even when the territorial Power is belligerent No opposition was advanced by the members to the first three of the foregoing propositions but much discussion arose as to what the term  neutrality as employed in the final proposition could be held to imply M de Martens of St Petersburg advocated the  neutrality  of the water way in the sense that it should in time of war be declared 4 8THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL 23 entirely inaccessible to the warships of belligerents Sir Travers Twiss pointed out that Great Britain would never be a party to any agreement such as would in time of war cut off her marine connection with India Professor Neu mann suggested the possibility of creating a  Marine Bel gium but finally the Institute placed its views on record by voting three declarations I That it is to the general interest of all nations that the maintenance of the Suez Canal and its use for communica tions of every kind shall be as far as possible protected by treaty 2 With this object in view it is desirable that states should come to an arrangement with a view to avoiding as far as possible every act whereby the canal and its dependencies might be damaged in time of war 3 If any Power should damage the works of the canal it shall be bound to repair as speedily as possible the dam age and to reestablish full liberty of navigation These declarations were far from satisfying the more ardent advocates of a stringent international control such as were Professors Martens and Bluntschli their adoption was only secured through the influence of Mr Holland But the proceedings of the Institutecited here in the absence of any diplomatic discussions on the matterdisclose that despite the interplay of varied motions and interests repre sentative jurists of all nationalities were convinced of the desirability of rendering the canal inviolate in time of war through the medium of an international agreement For as motives in this direction the political interests of several states were supplemented by the desire of shareholders in the canal company to obtain the greatest possible revenue in tolls and the wish of shipowners and forwarders of all countries for the securing of an unimpeded transit The idea of neutrality was moreover not a new one although there had as yet been no instance of the suc cessful application of the principle to the case of an arti 41924 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ficial canal Not only had territories such as those of Switzerland Savoy Belgium and Luxemberg been rendered immune from hostile operations but the principle of neu trality had been extended to waters in case of the Black Seadeclared neutral by the Treaty of Paris in I8561 The ClaytonBulwer Treaty of I850 had in one of its clauses contained the guarantee of the signatory Powers that the canal to be constructed across the Central American isthmus should be  forever open and free while a treaty between the United States and New Granada now Colombia in 1846renewed in I87ohad guaranteed the neutrality of the whole Isthmus of Panama But while the savants of the Institute were discussing the possibilities of a successful application of the principle of complete neutrality to the Asiatic gateway the finances of Egypt reached the state which necessitated the joint interven tion of Great Britain and France the governments of which countries assumed control of the Pashas financial affairs in the interest of European bondholders A couple of years later came Arabis revolt upon which France after vacillating in its attitude threw the whole burden of Egyptian affairs upon British shoulders with the result that the eventual British occupation of Egypt gave a new aspect to the whole question of canal neutralization for the government of Great Britain now claimed a dominant voice as representing not alone the largest financial and commercial interest in the canal but as representing the territorial power as well The canal com pany was however still completely under French influence and during the early eighties English shipping interests had complained loudly of discrimination in favor of French com merce alleged to have been made by the canal officials But 1  The Black Sea is neutralized Its waters and ports thrown open to the mer cantile marine of every nation are formally and in perpetuity interdicted to the flag of war of either of the Powers possessing its coasts or any other Power Treaty of Paris Art XI 2 In 1883 Great Britain owned nearly half the shares in the canal while four fifths of the traffic which passed through was British ownedDicey  Nine teenth Century August i883 pp x89205 420THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL 25 now that British influence in Egypt had become predomi nant proposals began to be made looking toward the con struction of a second canal which should be entirely under British control In I882 a proposal in this direction was actually laid before Parliament by the ministry of the day but that body refused its ratification and the project of a second canal was allowed to drop But the failure of this new project to receive Parliamentary concurrence served only to strengthen the attitude of the British Ministry with regard to the freedom of the existing channelan attitude which first declared in 1877 had been reiterated by Mr Gladstone in a speech at the Mansion House in 1882 on which occasion he declared that  Egypt having become the great gate between East and West it is essential for the industry and enterprise of ipankind that the gate should be open The events of 1882 had however even more than the events of I877 shown the difficulty and the not improb able impossibility in certain eventualities of fully enforcing this canon of British policy for during the course of the revolt the temporary success of Arabis forces aided by the all but active sympathy of the canal officials had almost succeeded in effecting the closure of the waterway to Eng lish commerce The British Ministry concluded therefore that the difficulty would be removed by the permanent neu tralization of the canal under an international guarantee and accordingly on January 3 1883 Lord Granville addressed a note to the Courts of Paris Berlin Vienna Rome and St Petersburg looking toward the consumma tion of an agreement with this end in view The direct causes of this proposal were given by Lord Granville under three heads I the danger to which the canal had been exposed during the brief period of the success of the recent in surrection 2 The altered circumstances resulting from the British occupation of Egypt in aid of the Khedive and 3 the attitude assumed by the directors and officials of the canal company at a critical period in the course of the campaign 42126 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The note contained a proposal embodied in eight clauses suggesting in general that the canal should be free for the passage of all ships in any circumstances that no hostilities should take place in the canal or in its approaches even in the event of Turkey being one of the belligerents that no troops or munitions of war should be disembarked on its banks nor fortifications erected thereon or in the vicinity and that each government should be made liable for any damage done the canal by one of its public vessels Finally Lord Granville suggested the convening of an international congress to discuss the proposals advanced The British occupation of Egypt had however in the opinion of some of the continental powers put a new face on the whole question France and Russia now conceived that their interests would be better served by the permanent neutralization not of the canal alone but of Egypt itself In other words the Suez question had become overshadowed by the Egyptian question Thus the eminent Russian Jurist Professor Martens in an article contributed to the Revue du droit Internationale about this time declared  The danger which menaces the canal in time of war will be very sensibly diminished if the permanent neutrali zation of Egypt is made an accomplished fact and if such is guaranteed by all the great European powers In this case the Egyptian government established on a solid basis can make its first object the guaranteeing of the security of the canal and all the Powers guaranteeing will be obliged to defend Egypt against an attack whether directed against the canal or its inviolate territory But an international congress for the discussion of the whole Egyptian question was not what the British govern ment desired and for two years the adhesion of the Powers to Lord Granvilles proposal of 1883 was not secured In I885 however a convention of the Powers met in London to discuss certain matters relating to Egyptian finances and this 1 La Question Egyptienne t le droit internationale Vol xiv pp 355402 422JTHEI NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL 27 occasion the British foreign office seized to reiterate its propo sals with regard to the security of the canal And under instructions from their respective governments the delegates to the financial convention agreed that a further congress should be forthwith assembled at Paris to attempt the estab lishment of a definite understanding designed to guarantee in all times and by all the Powers the free usage of the Suez Canal This congress was duly convened at Paris on March 30 I885 the states represented being Germany AustroHungary Spain France Great Britain Holland Russia Turkey and Egypt1 At the outset the representatives of France and of Great Britain submitted projects which differed principally not in regard to the nature of the neutralization but in regard to the means whereby the maintenance of strict neutrality should be assured The British representatives proposed to leave the enforcement of neutrality in the hands of the Khedivethis ruler being at the time under British control while the French delegates desired rather the formation of a permanent international commission composed of represen tatives of the great Powers together with a delegate from Turkey and one from Egypt which should be charged with the duty of seeing that no infringement of the international agreement occurred On the main question of the advisa bility of an international guarantee of neutrality there was complete unanimityand the diverse interests of France and Great Britain were finally reconciled as regards the mode of supervision by the adoption of a compromise wherein provision was made that the execution of the agreement should rest in the first place with the Khedive and failing him with the Porte the Powers being duly advised and consulted by the latter Accordingly articles of agreement to the number of seventeen in all were drawn up and agreed 1 Egypt was represented by Fakry Pascha who had a consultative voice only in the proceedings The British delegates to this congress were Sir Julian now Lord Pauncefote and Sir Charles RiversWilson the present president of the Grand Trunk Railway 42328 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADBMY upon by which the high contracting parties covenanted that the Suez Canal should be for all time  free and open as well in time of war as in time of peace to all ships both of com merce and of war without distinction of flag  and bound themselves not to make any attack upon the channel nor  to exercise the right of blockade The same immunity was to apply to the subsidiary freshwater canal and to the mate rials works and appurtenances belonging to the company The Maritime Canal was to rest even in time of war open to the war vessels of belligerents but  no right of war nor any act having for its result the obstruction of the freedom of navigation should be exercised within the canal nor in its ports of access nor within a radius of three marine miles of its ports even although the Ottoman Porte should be one of the belligerents Moreover the war vessels of belliger ents shall not in the canal nor in its ports of access revictual or provision except within the limits of strict necessity and the transit of such vessels shall be effected with the least possible delay Further it is provided in the Articles that the sojourn of belligerent warships at Port Said and in the roadstead of Suez  shall not be longer than twentyfour hours save in the case of a forced putting into port And where vessels of both belligerents happen to be contemporaneously in port it is provided that an interval of at least twentyfour hours shall elapse between the time of their respective departures Belligerents are bound not to disembark nor to take on within the canal or its ports any troops munitions or materials of war but in the case of an accidental obstruction of the channel they may dis embark or embark in the ports of access troops in bodies not exceeding one thousand men with stores and munitions in proportion Prizes en route are by the terms of the agree ment to be reckoned as vessels of war and no signatory Power is to permanently maintain within the canal waters any armed vessel Nevertheless in the ports of Port Said and Suez a permanent station of not more than two vessels 424THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL 29 may be maintained by any Power so desiring always pro vided that the Power so doing be not at the time a bellig erent The foregoing were the chief declaratory provisions then follow provisions designed to ensure their execution In the first instance the diplomatic agents in Egypt of the signatory Powers are charged with the duty of taking cognizance of any menace to the free passage of the canal or any threatened violation of the provisions agreed upon They are to meet on the request of any three of their numberunder the presidency of their deanand to inform the Egyptian government of any apprehended or actual danger In any casewhether danger appears or notthe agents are to meet annually under the presidency of a speciallyappointed commissioner of the Ottoman Porte or of their own accord in the absence of this official and to satisfy themselves that the provisions of the agreement have been observed The Egyptian government on the receipt of information from the agents at Cairo of the signatory Powers shall take within the limits of his powers    such measures as are necessary to secure the observance of the agreement But in case the Egyptian government shall not have at its disposal sufficient means of doing this it shall make appeal to the government of the Ottoman Empire upon which shall then devolve the duty of taking such measures as are neces sary to secure the observance of the international agreement respecting the canal at the same time giving advice to the governments of the six great European Powers and if need be consulting with them on the matter It was provided moreover that the provisions of the agreement should not operate to prevent Turkeyor the Khedive acting in virtue of his authority conferred by firmanfrom taking such measures as might become neces sary for the defence of their respective territories provided always that no hindrance to navigation ensued and that due notice of such necessity be given to the governments of the 42530 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY six chief Powers by the Ottoman authorities But this exception was not to be construed as permitting either the Turkish or Egyptian government to erect any fortifications within the neutralized area Finally the high contracting parties agreed by the application of the principle of equality in all that con cerns the free usage of the canala principle which forms one of the bases of the agreementthat none among themselves should have any territorial or commercial advan tages or privileges in the international arrangements made in regard to the canal They likewise agreed to bring the agreement to the notice of such states as had not been rep resented in the congress and to invite their adhesion Rati fications were to be exchanged at Constantinople within the space of one month or as soon thereafter as possible but it was not however until October 29 I888 that these were formally given The assent given by England was a qualified one for it stipulated that the terms of the agree ment should be held to bind Great Britain only when a set tlement of the internal affairs of Egypt should have enabled her to withdraw her troops from that country As it was generally understood by the Powers that the British occupa tion would be a matter of short duration no objection seems to have been raised to this proviso in the assent given by the British representative at the time ratifications were exchanged But the longlookedfor British evacuation of Egypt has not yet come and it was upon this qualification that Mr George now Lord Curzon when Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs stated in the House of Com mons a few years ago that Great Britain did not yet look upon the provisions of the international agreement as binding her own actions with regard to the Suez Canal1 1 On July I 1898 Mr Davitt inquired in the House of Commons as to the breach of Article 4 of the Suez Canal Convention by Spanish ships of war remaining at Port Said beyond the twentyfour hours therein stipulated to which Mr Curzon replied The provisions of the Suez Canal Convention to which the honorable 426THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL 31 Such then is the history of those rather extended steps through which the canal neutralization was eventually con cluded The significance of the matter as a precedent for the neutralization of similar future works was indeed great but it was greatly lessened by the presence of several impor tant attendant circumstances peculiar to the case and care must therefore be had that the precedent be not given a too unqualified application During the course of the negotia tions between the United States of America and Great Britain in regard to the adoption of an understanding with reference to the proposed Nicaraguan Canal and during the course of the discussions upon the sotermed HayPauncefote Treaty constant reference has been made to the Suez neutralization agreement as a pertinent precedent But it is not so certain that the analogy holds good in every way In the first place it may be noted that in the case of the Suez Canal negotiation for neutralization began after the work had been completed and after many nations had by virtue of longcontinued use acquired a more or less vested interest in its free navigation The companys charter had as has been seen provided that the waterway should always remain open as a neutral passage to all ships and acting upon the assurance thus given the commercial interests of the East and West had already entered into relations based upon the member refers have never been brought into operation Hansard Fourth Series Vol 60 pp 799800 Subsequently on July 12 1898 Mr Gibson Bowles asked a further question as to whether the Convention was still in existence and in operation and if not when and under what circumstances the Convention had ceased to exist or to operate Mr Curzon in reply said  The Convention in question is certainly in existence but as I informed an honorable member in reply to a question some days ago has not been brought into practical operation This is owing to the reserves made on behalf of Her Majestys government by the British delegates at the Suez Canal Commission Hansard Vol 6i p 667 The reservation made by the British delegates may be found on page 292 of Blue Book Egypt No 19 and is as follows Aussi les Delegu6s de la Grande

alwaysopen transit via Suez But in the case of the Nicaraguan Canal proposal is made to secure the immunity from belligerent operations of a work which as yet does not exist and in regard to which no quasirights of passage can have been acquired The territorial power in Central America has not moreover stipulated that the canal shall be perpetually a neutral passage and while the char tered company which undertook the construction of the Suez waterway was most persistent in its efforts to secure for it a guarantee of immunityhaving only financial and not strategic interests to servethe United States as constructor of the Nicaraguan Canal may not unreasonably find that political and strategic considerations require it to exert its efforts in just the opposite direction from that pursued by the Suez Company Again one must bear in mind that the question of transit across the Isthmus of Suez has at all times been more or less closely connected with the greater Egyptian question Egypt had been as has been pointed out for over half a century under the more or less strict control of the European Powers which from the Convention of London in I840 had treated the affairs of the Khedival State as their common property Not only so but being under Turkish suzerainty Egypt and Egyptian affairs formed a factor in the greater  Eastern Question in the handling of which the Powers of Europe had long since acquired vested rights Let it be borne in mind therefore that the question of the status of the Suez Canal in time of war was not an isolated one but formed a part of the Egyptian question and through it of the Eastern Question in dealing with which the various Powers of Europe had acquired the right to a predominant voice The neutralization agreement was looked upon as being but one step in the settlement of the mass of intricate questionsmany of them still unsettledarising out of the rival ambitions of European states to acquire interests in the Levant 428THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE SUEZ CANAL 33 And yet anotherthough perhaps not as important point of difference may be noted The neutralization of the Suez Canal was undertaken and effected through the cooperation of practically all the European states The Nicaraguan negotiations are being conducted by two Powers only with the result that an eventual agreement would neces sarily bindin the first instancethose two states alone It can scarcely be taken as a certainty that all other states would give an unqualified assent to an agreement in the formulation of which they had been given no voice what ever No agreement between the United States and Great Britain can establish any guarantee of neutrality which shall be more than coextensive with the ability of those two Powers to enforce the provisions in the event of an attempted violation by nonsignatory states In the case of the Suez provisions deference was duly had to the wishes of all the states which had cared to send representatives and important attractions in the original drafts were made in compliance with the wishes of such minor states as Spain and Holland It may be added that all important neutralizations such as those of Savoy Belgium Luxemberg the mouths of the Danube and the Black Sea as well as that of the Suez Canal have been the result not of an agreement between the two individual states most directly concerned but of a general international agreement The case of the Suez Canal therefore can scarcely be takenas some British writers and the British press gener ally have been rather disposed to take itas an unqualified precedent for the neutralization of the projected Nicaraguan Canal by means of an agreement between the governments of Great Britain and the United States Furthermore if we recall that ILord Palmerston stoutly opposed at the very out set the construction of the Suez Canal on the ground that it would be detrimental to British commercial and political interests that after its successful completion the British ministry refused to accept de Lesseps proposal for its 42934 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY neutralization on the ground that  it was open to many objections of a political and practical character  asserting instead that Great Britain would by her own might secure the immunity of the canal from hostile attack that the earliest sign of British disposition to concur in an agreement for the neutralization of the Suez waterway came only after the English occupation of Egypt and finally that in the absence of any official disavowal of Lord Curzons statement Great Britain still stands unpledged to observe the terms of the agreement of 1885 if these features are borne in mind it will be seen that from a British standpoint the precedent is not one to be ruthlessly advanced Nevertheless the action of the various European states in relation to the Suez Canal marked an important victory for the general idea of the neutralization of important inter national works The day now seems almost gone when large developments in international law can satisfactorily be effected through the agencies of logic or analogy The jurists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries reasoned out the principles of their science their successors however must chiefly build upon conventions between nations As legal fictions and equity have ceased to be agents by which private law is extended or brought into harmony with the wants of society and have given place to legislation so in public law the dicta of textwriters count as time goes on for less and less while treaties and conventions import more and more WV BENNETT MUNRO Berlin

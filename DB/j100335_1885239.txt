THIS is undoubtedly the most notable work upon its subject that has been written in America For the first time scholars have seriously analyzed innumerable laws and their working and have compared them with their counterparts abroad and produced a book for the guidance of others Anyone familiar with continental textbooks like those of Bry and Pic will appreciate the kind of book in question From such works it differs most in its natural emphasis upon American law and laws and in its commendable directness and compactness These qualities justify its desire to help the plain citizen who unlike the student reads not compulsorily but of his volition Great care has been taken in the selection and orderly presentation of material College teachers who have been referring their students to a dozen books for acquaintance with the worlds chief laws will be deeply grateful for this volume Some of the laws have been nowhere so effectively described There is generally a history of the steps of legisla tion the provisions of important laws are stated with elab orateness and the more pointed court interpretations are almost invariably given More or less is said of what things employers and employees desire and oppose Both authors bring to their study an established interest in democratic movements for legislation  In a democracy it is the people themselves whose collective opinion finally determines what the laws shall be The collective opinion is to be touched through  the citizen and the student  by formulating  fundamental principles which may be gener ally applied  Throughout it is the principles of labor law    which are emphasized The books title and such passages as these in its Preface are tempting and they sug I Principles of Labor Legislation By John R Commons and John B Andrews New York Harper and Brothers 1916 pp 524REVIEWS 567 gest a more philosophic treatment than a manual would give Should we have legislation  Why  How much should we have  Why Of what sorts  Why  Unless he can deal with these questions the way is thorny for whoever tries to persuade the unpersuaded In a book intended partly for the citizen there is of necessity no place for highly abstract reasoning Similarly altho the great problems of human policy reach off into the controverted realms of ethics and of politics there need be here no excursion into those realms A nearer ground exists in which pragmatic tests of reason ableness avail In the present review no attempt is made to give a summary of the books contents nor to deal with minor issues of opinion and fact I desire rather to point out what a study of principles seems to entail and how the present book accords with what seem legitimate expectations The initial chapter entitled  The Basis of Labor Law tells how the free laborer and the permanent laboring class emerged what the rights of individuals are and by what legal principles they are safeguarded Much of this is finely explicit and clear Partly it is overconcentrated The notion for instance of the  free  laborer pp 2 3 should be made clearer since the task of the volume is to show how his life may become less constrained The rights and princi ples discussed turn upon the Declaration of Independence and the constitutions For a study of the principles of American labor legislation such a treatment has obvious value But since much of the book deals with foreign laws enacted to deal with situations similar to those of the United States a better procedure would seem to be to discuss broadly the uni versal grounds for legislation and only then to introduce the American viewpoint whose rationality is not obvious All men are equal and therefore have equal rights  but equality seems insufficiently defined and different state constitutions list different rights certain rights are inalienable  yet this phrase has to be interpreted to mean  alienable but pro tected Since rights have been so fundamental in legislation since no concept is more loosely used on the platform and in the press since such a phrase as  the right to labor  has568 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS been so notable in labor movements and we hear so much today of  the right to a living wage it is regrettable that the argument does not go farther Numerous allusions to rights elsewhere in the volume while they throw some light chiefly accentuate the need for an ampler earlier statement The reader infers readily that rights are modifiable and he is told in so many words that some important American rights have proceeded from amendment of the fundamental law and from judicial readings The recent literature of ethics and jurisprudence contains much that one would like to see re flected here Our fundamental laws grew out of a laissez faire philosophy The new social tendencies conflict with the philosophy so as to produce a kind of legal hypocrisy We wish to restrict child labor because child labor is bad for the child A good constitution would here see and approve a general principle But we can enact the law only on the ground that interstate commerce needs to be regulated anew We would protect matchworkers from  phossy jaw The Constitution gives to Congress the power to raise money to pay bills Congress taxes the match industry by a law that would be regarded as a failure if any revenue were collected By such strange justifications we can enact desirable laws but in the circumstances the Constitution hardly remains a good instrument through which to begin a study of general principles of legislation A labor law is set forth to be one which protects the labor contract Chapter I It has long seemed to me that such a definition is needlessly narrow The  laboring class  includes large groups of individuals who have no employer but are in most other respects placed as are the employed I refer especially to the host of small tradespeople independent artisans cash and share tenant farmers fisherfolk peasant proprietors even who in some places are a veritable proleta riat Commons and Andrews second chapter dealing with  Individual Bargaining and having in mind the laborer as debtor creditor tenant and competitor cannot escape touching one or two of these groups Some of the measures dealt with in this chapter  imprisonment for debt homeREVIEWS 569 stead exemption loans to farmers legal aid have the larger scope so have many measures later considered The difficulty is more serious when as in the chapter on health and safety a great problem is presented which only inciden tally turns upon the labor contract There we are told that when the workers are independent they can control their working conditions But since the industrial revolution they have toiled upon premises controlled not by thenm selves but by another  the employer  p 295 But this argument for legislation fails to note that safety and health depend not only on control but on technical knowledge and willingness to provide against risks the worker is deficient in both If all workers were independent the problem would doubtless still have to be managed by legislation So it is not surprising that tenement house work which  is done by the family group in its customary livingquarters  p 336 usually evades the rules of health This second chapter illustrates well what seem to be both the strength and the weakness of the book There is a survey singularly inclusive in its brevity of the characteristic laws concerning wage payment agricultural immigrant and con vict labor and industrial courts The telling features of the laws of various countries and many states are adduced On the other hand there is little evaluation of laws There is almost no attempt to say what circumstances make for the fitness of one or another kind of law It is commonly not clear which law is to be approved if any A section on the conditions of hired labor in agriculture is included but the section on agricultural labor legislation barely hints at appro priate measures for this problem and is merely descriptive of other measures A more definite position is argued on prison labor On the other hand tho Mr Commons has written one of our best books on immigration it cannot be inferred from the text that the measures of restriction here described are those which should be enacted Such inconclusiveness and lack of pointed argument such an absence of constructive reasoning in the way of measures not hitherto enacted is common in this volume570 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS No better writing in point of balance and incisiveness is contained in the book than that which describes the law of conspiracy in its relation to collective bargaining The ques tion of rights reappears and again one wishes that the previous specific discussion had been ampler The wobbling of the courts in their attitude toward strikes introduces a discussion of principles in which the authors sympathy occasionally shows though conclusions are not presented For lack of argument these sections would not guide the next judge in the next strike The discussion of boycotts and of picketing also brings no specific recommendations for legislation The authors general attitude appears in a section headed the  justification of true collective bargaining These five pages are the most important in a chapter of seventyfive Complete freedom to combine  they hold  should be given to both employers and employees And again  It is in the interest of the public that the most favorable condi tions of labor shall prevail Since labor constitutes such a large part of the public the general welfare depends inti mately upon its advancement While the public suffers from high prices it benefits from high wages Any excess of advantage that organized laborers might secure would be held in check by organized employers It is at such a point that the plan of the book seems most open to question No one could ask for abridgment of the descriptive and expository sections But the crucial discus sion of principle is all too brief If trade unions tend to standardize working terms they are so far good But can the organized employers neutralize the possible gains of a mon opoly union  Not necessarily Technically as the authors say unions  have nothing to sell  p 116 yet such is their power that labor contracts are not concluded till unions have fixed the terms One set of laborers may tie up a complex industry completely A railway may hold it cheaper to raise the wages of its engineers than to stop transportation The public would pay If all organized workmen were to secure higher wages would not all unorganized workmen be worse off because of higher prices  And if all workmen wereREVIEWS 571 organized would there be any effect upon wages apart from standardization  Again the coal miners may ask for an increase The opera tors may presently grant the increase and lift the price so that a monopoly wage and a monopoly price would both result So A and B employer and employee oppress C consumer The state is asked to acquiesce if A and B are equally strong Once more is standardization of working conditions secured through collective bargaining better than through legislation and administration  Later p 246 it is held that where trade unions cannot regulate the hours of labor of men the state should do so But nowhere apparently is there a comparison of the two methods worked out altho upon the results of a comparison may depend the degree and sense in which the state encourages collective bargaining If it should be the case that indefinitely only some workmen will be strongly unionized and if through influence on prices that should redound to the disadvantage of other workpeople then perhaps comprehensive legislative regulation of wages might be a better policy than the encouragement of trade unions In theory such a course is not fanciful It need only be re called that a stock argument for compulsory insurance is that too few persons are reached by the mere encouragement of voluntary measures  the English friendly societies had even a much wider membership than the English trade unions have when compulsory insurance supervened In the treatment of mediation by government in collective bargaining there appears again an admirable survey of the existing kinds of legislation The merits and demerits of our state laws are not discussed and we are not told why the Erdman act was superseded an untouched field for federal legislation exists but we are not told what form this legisla tion should have An analysis of the Australian measures in about fifteen pages is by all odds the best brief discussion of those laws which I have seen Compulsory arbitration is opposed Laborers do not want it employers do not Only  the immense but miscellaneous class of unskilled and semi skilled men and of women and children  would gain  a572 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS rather important group But the public gains too Anyone who has read the statistics of the collapse of employment in the great branches of British industry during the coal strike of 1912 must see that the public are not the only consumers of products who must suffer during a strike and that unorgan ized workpeople are far from the only ones who would gain by the prompt adjustment of a dispute The argument for the minimum wage turns largely upon the absence of organization which itself tends to be explained by the overcrowding of occupations by young inexperienced often temporary workers Both in Australia and England however later developments have carried the law far beyond its first intention and in Australia at least rulings cover many industries in which wages are not low in the sense which this chapter initially outlines When the wages bill is small and when abnormal  almost pathological  conditions of living exist the evidence as to wage increase as in the English chainmaking industry seems reliable But the general evi dence on page 191 is open to criticism Lately perhaps because of the decline of immigration in war time New England textile mills announced a ten per cent increase in wages had a wage board decreed this increase it would have seemed as good evidence of minimum wage effectiveness as any evidence here given The most extraordinary enactment as yet is the English coal mines act involving a million workers but the effect apart from some standardization of working conditions has so far been disappointing In general the reasoning in this chapter concerning effects has a post hoc ergo propter hoc character which in the complexity of social problems is dangerous The minimum wage is an extremely interesting experiment which I think can do little harm and I hope and believe will do good but no advantage will come from the overstatement of its benefits There is a good dis cussion of constitutionality but questions of right the right to a living wage and to a family living wage are here omitted At the very end of a chapter on hours of labor reference is made to  the need for a system whereby permanent bodies will be authorized    to fix varying hours of labor on aREVIEWS 573 basis which will adequately protect the health and welfare of the employees and the state That hours of labor should vary is then a main principle of social policy It is a pity that this position was not taken in the first paragraph and then amply explained and defended Not that one would desire the disappearance of sixty compact pages of survey of legislation  they are too good to be lost  but one could read with a sense of direction With trade unions the demand for shorter hours is often a veiled demand for higher wages this since health is the issue should make us skeptical of them The  eighthour day  slogan may arouse a natural sympathy for some workers if no other agency is at hand to regulate hours but it is a pernicious slogan if its seeming desire for equality covers and perpetuates real inequality Much more should be made of the tendency of shorterday regulations to exaggerate the pace of industry Chi va piano va sano chi va sano va lontano Life loses its poise and whole someness when men rush for onethird of the day and try to regain their balance in twothirds as seems to be the case in such a place for example as Butte Perhaps such a chap ter as this dealing with the problems arising from the length of the working day should discuss the related prob lem of scientific management a device in which the state as employer at least has an interest That legislation has not been enacted may be the best reason for discussing principles of legislation The chapters on  Unemployment  and  Social Insur ance especially the latter suffer from brevity of treatment Social insurance appears to be taken to mean  insurance by society I had perhaps wrongly supposed Sozialversicherung and assurances sociales to be alternative to Arbeiterversich erung and workmens insurance The insufficient incomes of men are held to explain the failure of voluntary associations state control and subsidy are inadequate so compulsion and a tax on employers are necessary One cannot help feeling that much of the reasoning here including that on division of costs this is supplemented in the books last chapter is too simple Would a related reasoning call for compulsory labor574 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS exchanges and other applications of the compelling power to labor problems  It is natural here to speak of compulsory institutions because notable laws provide them One feels for instance that if St Gall and England had not legislated upon compulsory unemployment insurance this book altho a constructive work discovering and applying principles might not have gone beyond a consideration of voluntary insurance In the present chapter the difficult problems of malingering and other fraud or demoralization are not seriously discussed nor are certain ulterior consequences of a traceable sort The concluding chapter is on  Administration It has a clear sense of its problem and appears to rest on sure ground Especially well managed is a section on  cooperation by pressure which sketches certain fundamental notions that deserve elaboration It is as a study of principles that Commons and Andrews book falls short of expectations What it says about prin ciples has been said before and as well Principles should point to laws rather than be inferred from them Legislation is only the agent of social policy which first envisages its problem and then asks how desired changes may be secured So much is not novel to our authors but they seem to have underestimated its importance and made their book in con trast a survey of the forms of labor legislation Pigous book on industrial peace begins with the declaration  The prob lem of this book is ethical  to determine what principles and methods ought to be employed in the settlement of in dustrial differences rather than to describe those which are employed  such a procedure warrants the use of the name Principles in a title In the book of Commons andAndrews the reader often feels that one law is commended as much as a different one or the authors seem neutral and unwilling to commit themselves Skilfully selected excerpts from court utterances are made or the intentions of different laws are set forth but no recommendation based on principle follows If principles do not guide they are not worth writing a book about It ought to be possible to reduce the main principlesREVIEWS 575 of each chapter to a set of propositions and each of these should have been demonstrated in the text The principles so presented should stand in a clear relation to the larger principles set forth in an introductory chapter Such a pro cedure would demand a bolder wrestling with serious diffi culties than has been undertaken but a contribution to principles would more probably result Where a principle cannot be developed so much should be explicitly stated I should be sorry if my comment seemed to unsay the praise with which the review began The positive excellences of the book are many As a text it makes an admirable basis for class discussion students find it direct clear interesting Its inclusion of detail will necessitate revision every few years but I do not expect it soon to be superseded as a class text And if its title had not stressed principles I should have written a different review  and a shorter one ROBERT F FOERSTER HARVARD UNIVERSITY

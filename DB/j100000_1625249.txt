atomic weight determina tion of tellurium by Masumi Chikashige already noticed in SCIENCE Previous de terminations have been made from tellu rium associated with heavy metals and the figure found 1276 is higher than that of iodin below which it should be according to the periodic law It has been thought that some impurity of higher atomic weight might account for the anomaly Chika shige worked with a tellurium of a wholly different Japanese origin occurring as sociated with sulfur and selenium He also reaches the same result 1276 It may however be noted that if the supposed con tamination in the American and European tellurium be due to a higher element of the sulfur group it would not be un natural to suppose the same element present in the Japanese mineral which contains 9975 per cent sulfur 006 per cent selen ium and 017 per cent tellurium J L H ASTROPHYSICAL NOTES IN Circular No 12 of the Harvard Col lege Observatory dated November 2 1896 Professor Pickering published the discovery on the Draper Memorial photographs of a remarkable stellar spectrum that of Zeta Puppis Mag 25 R A 8 01m Dec 390 43 In addition to dark hydrogen lines and K there were two broad bright lines at A 4633 and 4688 and a peculiar series of dark lines whose wavelengths were rhythmically related These were A 4544 4201 4027 3925 3859 3816 and 3783 It was at first thought that they represented some new element not yet found on the earth or in the stars Circular No 16 of date Janu ary 12 1897 announced however the im portant discovery that these lines are very I VCE N S VOL V No 123 probably due to hydrogen being produced under conditions of luminosity not hitherto known Professor Pickering finds that by writing Balmers formula connecting the wavelengths of the hydrogen lines in the form 36461 2 the ordinary lines will be given when for n the even integers 6 8 10 etc are substi tuted and the new lines when the odd integers from 9 to 21 are successively as signed to n It appears that the lines for n  7 A 5412 9 A 4544 11 A 4201 and 13 A 4027 have been hitherto recorded in certain spectra of type IIb Professor Pickering has since reported that three other southern stars are somewhat similar to Zeta Puppis in having part of the lines of the new series MEANWHILE Professor H Kayser of Bonn whose work in conjunction with Professor Runge on the harmonic relations of spectral lines is so favorably knownalso investi gated the origin of the new lines and pub lishes his conclusions in two articles in the Astrophysical Journal for February and April Hydrogen had been the only element hav ing harmonically related lines which had possessed only a single series of such lines Now Kayser and Runge have found that two of the series of lines for an element end at nearly the same place Hence on exam ining the frequencies of the new lines Kayser concluded that they have this char acteristic and represent a new hydrogen series a conclusion confirmed in his second article written after seeing Circular No 16 Thus the spectral relations of hydrogen lines become normal It is a matter of much interest to know if the lines of the new series can be pro duced in laboratory experiments If so im portant information as to stellar tempera tures and pressures is likely to be o btained   MAY 7 1897 SCIENCE THE Lick Observatory has just sent out Plates 2 to 5 of its Observatory Atlas of the Moon finely reproduced in photogravure on a scale of 38 inches to the lunar di ameter from the negatives obtained with the great refractor The publication of this valuable series of photographs was made possible by the generosity of a citizen of New York Mr W H Law IN the Monthly Notices of the Royal As tronomical Society for January Mr W F Denning contributes a catalogue of the real paths of 107 meteors observed by himself and others in England during the last ten years The averages are Height at first appearance736 miles 106 meteors Height at disappearance453  107 meteors Length of path621  105 meteors Velocity per second 269  58 meteors The greatest height of any wellobserved meteor was 126 miles In the above aver ages no distinction was made between fire balls and shootingstars IN the same number of the Notices Pro fessor G von Neissl of Briinn contributes a list of the real paths of 100 large meteors which have been authentically observed chiefly in the last two decades For these the average height when first seen was 91 miles No 77 of the list was visible from Servia to France traveling in a real path of 1770 miles from the hardly credible ele vation of 483 miles to that of 115 miles From a comparison of the catalogues of von Neissl and himself Denning shows several instances of the recurrence of large meteors from the same radiant indicating that they belonged to the same swarm E B F SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS Miss ALICE BACHE GOULD has given 20000 to the National Academy of Sciences as a me morial to her father the great astronomer B A Gould It will be known as the Gould fund and the income will be used to promote re searches in mathematics and astronomy SIR HENRY THOMPSON has presented the Royal Observatory at Greenwich with a tele scope said to be the most powerful instrument at present existing for the prosecution of astro nomical research by means of photography The photographic refractor has an object glass 26 inches in diameter The photographs it will take will be on twice the scale of 2 mm to one minute of arc and its short focal length gives it great lightgathering power The instrument now mounted at Greenwich has been in course of construction by Sir Howard Grubb of Dublin during the last three years THE Royal Observatory at Bonn has received from the state a preliminary appropriation of 30000 Marks which will ultimately be in creased to 90000 Marks for the construction and mounting of a refracting telescope of medium size SIR WILLIAM FLOWERS term o office as Di rector of the Natural History Departments of the British Museum has been extended for three years from the expiration of his retirement date under the age regulation of the Civil Service THE American Philosophical Society Phila delphia will hold a conversazione in honor of Sir Archibald Geikie on the evening of May 7th Sir Archibald Geikie will make a communica tion on recent geological work in the Hebrides and Faroe Isles THE Council of the British Medical Associa tion has conferred the gold medal of the Asso ciation on Mr C G Wheelhouse and Sir Wal ter Foster THE Cothenius medal Leopold Carolinische Akademie der Naturforscher has this year been awarded to Dr G Quincke professor of physics at Heidelberg DR P GRuHANT professor of physiology in the Paris Museum of Natural History has been awarded 4000 francs by the French govern ment to promote his researches on the applica tions of physiology to hygiene MR J H PRATT instructor of mineralogy in the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale Univer

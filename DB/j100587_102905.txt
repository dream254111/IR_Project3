PAST,I206888,IV A LETTER FROM THE REVEREND MR WILLIAM DERHAM F R S TO MR JOHN HAUGHTON F R S CONTAIN ING HIS OBSERVATIONS ON THE WEATHER C FOR SOME YEARS LAST PAST UPMINSTER APRIL THE 5TH 1703 I LATELY SENT MY WEATHER AND TABLES OF LAST YEAR TO DR SLOANE AND PROMISD WHEN I SHOULD HEAR FROM MR TOWNE LEY IN LANCASHIRE AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE WROTE THAT WAS CU RIOUS I HAVE LATELY RECEIVD MR TOWNELEYS LETTER AND TAKE THE OCCASION OF THAT LETTER TO WRITE NOW TO YOU TO GIVE YOU MY HEARTY THANKS FOR ALL FAVOURS THAT I HAVE RECEIVD FROM YOU AS WELL AS TO SEND YOU SOME OF THAT INGENIOUS CURIOUS GENTLEMANS OBSERVATIONS OF LAST YEAR AND MY OWN AND FIRST AS TO THE MOST REMARKABLE WEATHER ESPECIALLY RAIN OF LAST YEAR AND THE EFFECTS THEREOF MR TOWNELEY TELLS ME THAT IT IS A GENERAL COMPLAINT IN THE NORTH OF ENG LAND1444 INFERREDLANDINFERRED THAT THERE WERE BUT SMALL CROPS OF HAY WHICH CALA MITY BEFEL THE SOUTHERN PARTS ALSO THE CAUSE WHEREOF MAY BE PERCEIVD BY THE FOLLOWING FIRST TABLE OF MONTHLY RAIN IN WHICH YOU MAY PERCEIVE THE GROWING MONTHS OF MARCH AND APRIL TO HAVE BEEN DRY MONTHS IN LANCASHIRE AND MAY NO WET MONTHCONSIDERING THE QUANTITIES OF THE OTHERMONTHS AND OF OTHER YEARS PUBLISHD HERETOFORE IN THE PHILOS TRANS HERE AT UPMINSTER APRIL WAS FORTUNATELY A WET MONTH TILL THE 23D OR ELSE NO DOUBT WE SHOULD HAVE SUFFERD MORE THAN WE DID IN THE WANT OF HAY FOR THE GROWING MONTH OF MARCH WAS A DRY MONTH BY THE FOLLOWING TABLE AND MAY WHICH BY THE SAME TABLE SEEMETH TO HAVE HAD NEAR A DUE QUANTITY OF RAIN WAS A VERY DRY MONTH BY THE TABLES SENT TO DR SLOANE FOR IT APPEARS BY THEM THAT VERY LITTLE RAIN FELL FROM APRIL 23 TILL MAY 29 AND THEN FELL IN GREAT SHOWERS THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF THAT MONTHS RAIN MR TOWNELEY DOTH NOT TELL ME PARTICULARS BUT I GUESS IT TO BE AFTER THIS MANNER WITH THEM IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND FOR BESIDES THAT MARCH AND APRIL WERE DRY MONTHS WITH THEM AND MAY SOMEWHAT MORE WET YET PROBABLY THE WET OF MAY DID NOT FALL EARLY IN MAY FOR IT APPEARS BY THE FOLLOWING TABLE THE THIRD THAT THE MERCURY WAS HIGH AND IN SOME WHAT A FIXD STATION ON MAY 13 THUS MUCH FOR THE WEATHER IN THE SPRINGMONTHS OF THE YEAR 1702 AND THE EFFECTS IT HAD ON HAY WHICH EFFECTS I HAVE SOME REASON TO THINK EXTENDED TO MANY PARTS OF THIS KINGDOM BESIDES THOSE ALREADY SPOKEN OF AS TO THE OTHER MONTHS THERE IS LITTLE REMARKABLE BE SIDES THE VAST DISPROPORTIONS OF RAIN BETWEEN LANCASHIRE AND ESSEX WHICH I SHOULD SCARCE TAKE NOTICE OF IF IT WAS NOT WHAT HAPPENETH ALMOST EVERY YEAR AS WILL APPEAR BY THE FOLLOWING TABLE 1ST WHICH I NOW SEND TO COMPLEAT WHAT HATH BEEN PUBLISHED IN FORMER YEARS IN THE TRANSACTIONS THE CAUSE OF THIS I CANNOT JUDGE OF UNLESS IT BE THAT LANCASHIRE IS A MORE HILLY COUNTRY THAN ESSEX WHICH SORT OF LANDS AS THEY MORE NEED WET THAN VALES AND LOW PLAIN COUNTRIES DO1445 DO SO HAVE GREATER SHARES OF IT THAN THESE HAVE BESIDES I LEAVE IT TO YOU AND OTHERS TO JUDGE WHETHER SOMETHING MAY NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE WESTERN SCITUATION OF LANCASHIRE NEAR THE SEA FROM WHICH QUARTER THE WINDS IN ENGLAND BLOW MORE THAN FROM THE EASTWARD AT THE FOOT OF THE TABLE OF RAIN BESIDES THE QUANTITY WHICH FELL IN EACH YEAR I HAVE ADDED THE DEPTH THEREOF IN INCHES OR WHAT DEPTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OF IF THE EARTH HAD NOT IMBIBD IT BUT IT HAD STAGNATED ON THE SURFACE THERE OF FOR THE SATISFACTION OF YOUR SELF AND OTHERS THAT ARE CU RIOUS I HAVE ADDED TWO TABLES MORE OF THE STATIONS OF THE MERCURY IN THE BAROMETER AT TOWNELEY IN LANCASHIRE AND AT UPMINSTER IN ESSEX WITH THE DIFFERENCES THEREOF AND THIS OBSERVD AT 3 TIMES OF THE DAYVIZ IN THE MORNINGAND ABOUT 3 IN THE AFTERNOON AT TOWNELEYBUT AT NOON AT UPMINSTERAND AT 9 A CLOCK AT NIGHT ONE TABLE TO THE FIRST DAY OF EVERY MONTH THE OTHER THE MOST REMARKABLY LOW HIGH AND MORE SETTLD STATIONS OF THE  THE LAST YEAR 1702 BY THESE BAROMETRICAL TABLES IT MAY BE SEEN WHETHER AT ALL OR HOW FAR CONSENTANEOUS TO TRUTH THAT OPINION IS OF SOME LEARNED CURIOUS MEN BOTH IN ENGLAND AND ABROAD VIZ THAT THE  ASCENDETH AND DESCENDETH IN ALL PLACES AT THE SAME TIME AND IN THE SAME PROPORTION IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE  DOTH COMMONLY RISE AND FAIL IN ONE FAR DISTANT PLACE WHEN IT DOTH SO IN ANOTHER BUT NOT ALIKE ALSO WHEN ANY CON SIDERABLE VARIATION IS IN ONE PLACE IT IS SO IN ANOTHER WHEN REMARKABLY HIGH REMARKABLY HIGH WHEN LOW LOW WHEN A GREAT ASCENT OR DESCENT GENERALLY THE SAME ELSEWHERE BUT ONLY THE DIFFERENCES OF ALL THESE ARE NOT IN EQUAL PROPOR TION IN ALL PLACES ALL WHICH SEEMETH REASONABLE TO BE EX PECTED BY REASON OF THE DIFFERENCE OF WEATHER IN DIFFERENT PLACES ESPECIALLY AS TO WET AND DRY THERE IS ONE THING MORE IN THE FOLLOWING THIRD TABLE WHICH I THINK DESERVETH ESPECIAL REMARK BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT TO BE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE ALTERATION OF THE MERCURY THAT O O O O O O O O HATH1446 HATH EVER HAPPEND SINCE THE INVENTION OF THE BAROSCOPE AND THAT WAS THE DESCENT ON FEB 3D AND 4TH LAST CONCERNING WHICH MR TOWNELY IN A FORMER LETTER GIVES ME THIS ACCOUNT  THAT ON FEB 3D THE  WAS AT 3 IN THE MORNING AT 29 15  AT3 H 28 50 AND AT 10 AT NIGHT AT 27 5 THE NEXT DAY  IT FELL YET LOWER AND ABOUT 12 WAS AT THE LOWEST VIZ  27 39 BUT FOR AN HOUR BEFORE AND AS MUCH AFTERIT VARIED  ONLY SO MUCH AS TO MAKE IT SENSIBLE THAT IT WAS FALLEN AND  BEGAN TO RISE AGAIN THE LOWEST HE HAD EVER SEEN IT BEFORE  WAS ON NOV 18 1674 WHEN IT FELL TO 27 63 THAT MR  FLAMSTEED AT THE OBSERVATORY OBSERVD AS REMARKABLE A DI  SCENT OF HIS  AND THAT IT HAPPEND ABOUT THE SAME TIME  OF THE DAY VIZ 2 OF THE CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AT BOTH  PLACES AND LASTLY HE TELLS ME  THAT THE DESCENT IN FEB LAST  WAS THE GREATEST THAT HAS BEEN SINCE THE FILLING HIS TUBE  WHICH WAS IN MARCH 1665 THE PARTICULARS WHICH I OB SERVD HERE AT UPMINSTER ABOUT THAT DESCENT WERE THAT ON FEB 12 THE  WAS HIGH VIZ 29 80 THE NEXT MORNING 29 50 AT NOON 29 16 AT NIGHT 28 43 THE NEXT MORNING VIZ FEB 4 AT 7 OF THE CLOCK IT WAS FALLEN TO 28 5 AND WAS GLOBOSE AS IF IT HAD RISEN OR WAS INCLIND TO RISE BUT IT CONTINUD IN THE SAME STATION TILL AFTER NOON AND THEN BEGAN TO RISE ABOUT 2 OF THE CLOCK AND ROSE HASTILY THE WEATHER ACCOMPANYING WAS FAIR ON FEB 3D IN THE MORN ING HAZY AT NOON AND RAIN AT NIGHT AND A VIOLENT TEM PEST IN THE NIGHT AND ALL THE NEXT MORNING OF FEB 4TH THUS SIR I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE TROUBLE OF A LONG LETTER BUT WITH NO OTHER DESIGN THAN TO SHEW YOU MY RESPECTS AND GRATITUDE IF YOU THINK ANY THING IN IT WORTH THE COGNI ZANCE OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY YOU MAY COMMUNICATE IT IF YOU PLEASE HOWEVERI DESIRE YOU TO DO ME THE FAVOUR TO SHEW IT TO DR SLOANE BECAUSE I

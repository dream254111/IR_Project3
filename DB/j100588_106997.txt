Bart K B P R S,i206951,IV A mineralogical Account of the Native Gold lately disco vered in Ireland In a Letter from Abraham Mills Esq to Sir Joseph Banks Bart K B P 1A So Read December 17 1795 Cronebane Copper Mines near Rathdrun SIR Nov zi 1795 TFHE extraordinary circumstance of native gold being found in this vicinity early excited my attention and led me to seize the first opportunity that presented itself after my late ar rival here to inspect the place where the discovery was made I went thither on Tuesday the 8d of this monfth with Mr LLOYD of Havodtnos and Mr WEAVER The former having given you some account of the circumstances which attended the original discovery and since he left me a favourable day having enabled me to take a second view of the adjacent count try I shall now attempt to describe the general appearance and add such further information as has coirle to my knowP ledge The workings which the peasantry recently undertook are on the northeast side of the mountain Croughan K inshelly within the barony of Arklow avid county of Wicklow on the lands of the Earl of CARYSFORT wherein the Earl of ORMOND claims a right to the minerals in consequencee as I have been informed of a grant in the reign of King HENRY the SecondMr MILLSS mineralogical Account c 39 by Prince JOHN during his command of his fathers forces in Ireland  which grant was renewed and confirmed by Queen ELIZABETH and again by King CHARLES the Second The summit of the mountain is the boundary between the countiesofWicklowand Wexford seven English niles westfrom Arklow ten to the southwestward of Rathdrum and six south westerly from Cronebane mines by estimation about six hun dred yards above the level of the sea It extends W by N and Eby S and stretches away to the northeastward to Ballycoage where shafts have formerly been sunk and some copper and mnag netic iron ore has been found and thence to the NE there ex tends a tract of mineral country eight miles in length running through the lands of Ballymurtagh Ballygahan Tigrony Cronebane Connery and Kilmacoe in all which veins of copper ore are found and terminating at the slatequarry atBalnabarny On the highest part of the mountain are bare rocks being a variety of argillite whose joints range NNE and SSW hade to the SSW and in one part include a rib of quartz three inches wide which follows the direction of the strata Around the rocks for some distance is sound ground covered with heath descending to the eastward there is springy ground abounding with coarse grass and below that a very extensive bog in which the turf is from four to nine feet thick aid beneath it in the substratum of clay are many angular fragments of quartz containig chlorite and ferruginous earth Below the turbary the ground falls with a quick descent and three ravines are observed The central one which is the most considerable has been worn by torrents which derive their source from the bog the others are formed lower down  KxRWAN Edit i794 p23440 Mr MILLSs mineralogical Account of the mountain by springs which uniting with the former be low their junction the gold has been found The smaller have not water sufficient to wash away the incumbent clay so as to lay bare the substratum and their beds only contain gravel consisting of quartz with chlorite and other substances of which the mountain consists The great ravine presents a more interesting aspect the water in its descent has in a very short distance from the bog entirely carried off the clay and considerably worn down the substrata of rock which it has laid open to inspection Descending along the bed of the great ravine whose general course is to the eastward a yellow argillaceous shistus is first seen the laminve are much shattered are very thin have a slight hade to the SSW and range ESE and WNW Included within the shist is a vein of compact barren quartz about three feet wide ranging NE and SW  below this is another vein about nine inches wide having the same range as the former and hading to the northward consisting of quartz including ferruginous earth Lower down is a vein of a com pact aggregate substance apparently compounded of quartz ochraceous earth chert minute particles of mica and some little argillite of unknown breadth ranging E and W had ing fast to the southward and including strings of quartz from one to two inches thick the quartz containing ferruginous earth The yellow argillaceous shistus is a gain seen with its former hade and range and then adjacent to a quartz vein is laminated blue argillaceous shistus ranging NE and SW and hlading SE which is afterwards seen varying its range and hade running ENE and WSW and hading NNW lower down the blue shist is observed more compact though stillthe Native Gold discovered in Ireland 41 laminated The ground less steep becomes springy is in closed and the ravine shallower has deposited a considerable quantity of clay sand and gravel Following the course of the ravine or as it may now more properly be called the brook arrive at the road which leads to Arklow here is a ford and the brook has the Irish name of Augbatinavouglt the river that drowned the old maali hence it descends to the Aughrim river just above its confluence with that from Rathdrum which after their junction take the general name of the Ovo that discharging itself into the sea near the town of Arklow forms an harbour for vessels of small burthen The lands of Ballinvally are to the southward and the lands of Ballinagore to the northward of the ford where the blue shistus rock whose joints are nearly vertical is seen ranging ENE and WSW including small strings of quartz which con tain ferruginous earth The same kind of earth is also seen in the quartz contained in a vein from ten to twelve inches wide ranging ENE and WSW and hading to the southward which has been laid open in forming the Arklow road Here the valley is from twenty to thirty yards in width and is covered with substances washed down from the mountain which on the sides have accumulated to the depth of about twelve feet A thin stratum of vegetable soil lies uppermost then clay mingled with fine sand composed of small particles of quartz mica and shist beneath which the same substances are larger and constitute a bed of gravel that also contains nodules of fine grained iron stone which produces so per cent of crude iron incumbent on the rock are large tumblers of quartz a variety of argillite and shistus many pieces of the quartz are perfectly pure others are attached to the shistus MDCCXCVI G42 Mr MILLSS mineralogical Account of others contain chlorite pyrites mica and ferruginous earth and the arsenical cubical pyrites frequently occurs imbedded in the blue shistus In thismass of matter before the work ings began the brook had formed its channel down to the surface of the rock and between six and seven feet wide but in times of floods extended itself entirely over the valley Researches have been made for the gold amidst the sand and gravel along the run of the brook for near half a mile in length but it is only about one hundred and fifty yards above and about two hundred yards below the ford that the trials have been attended with much success within that space the valley is tolerably level and the banks of the brook have not more than five feet of sand and gravel above the rock added to this it takes a small turn to the southward and conse quently the rude surfaces of the shistus rock in some degree cross its course and form natural impediments to the par ticles of gold being carried further down the stream which still lower has a more rapid descent  besides the rude manner in which the country people worked seldom enabled them to penetrate to the rock in those places where the sand and gra vel were of any material depth Their method was to turn the course of the water wherever they deemed necessary and then with any instruments they could procure to dig holes down to the rock and by washing in bowls and sieves the sand and gravel they threw out to separate the particles of gold which it contained and from the slovenly and hasty way in which their operations were performed much gold most probably escaped their search and that indeed actually ap pears to have been the case for since the late rains washed the clay and gravel which had been thrown up gold has beenthe Native Gold discovered in Ireland 43 found lying on the surface The situation of the place and the constant command of water do however very clearly point out the great facility with which the gold might be se parated from the trash by adopting the mode of working practised at the best managed tin stream works in the county of Cornwall that is entirely to remove by machinery the whole cover off the rock and then wash it in proper buddles and sieves And by thus continuing the operations constantly advancing in the ravine towards the mountain as long as gold should be found the vein that forms its matrix might probably be laid bare The discovery was made public and the workings began early in the month of September last and continued till the i5th of October when a party of the Kildare militia arrived and took possession by order of government and the great con course of people who were busily engaged in endeavouring to procure a share of the treasure immediately desisted from their labour and peaceably retired Calculations have been made that during the foregoing pe riod gold to the amount of three thousand pounds Irish ster ling was sold to various persons the average price was three pounds fifteen shillingsper ounce hence eight hundred ounces appear to have been collected within the short space of six weeks The gold is of a bright yellow colour perfectly malleable the specific gravity of an apparently clean piece 19ooo A specimen assayed here by Mr WEAVER in the moist way produced from 24 grains 22jU grains of pure gold and 1iA43n of silver Some of the gold is intimately blended with and adherent to quartz some it is said was found united to the G e44  Mr MILLSS mineralogical Account of fine grained iron stone but the major part was entirely free from the matrix every piece more or less rounded on the edges of various weights forms and sizes from the most mi nute particle up to 2 OZ 1 7dwt only two pieces are known to have been found of superior weight and one of those is j and the other 22 ounces IV much regret not having been present when the work was going on that I might have seen the gold as found before prepared for sale by breaking off any extraneous matter that adhered for in that state a proper attention to the substances with which it was united and a subsequent diligent inspection of the several veins that range through the mountain might assist towards the discovery of that from whence it was de tached I shall shortly return to England and on my arrival will send specimens of the gold and of the different substances of the mountain to be deposited if you think proper in the cob lection of the Royal Society And am with great respect c ABRAHAM MILLS The bearings are all taken by the compass without allow ing for the variation BESIDES these accounts of the gold found in Ireland the following information has been received on that subject WILLIAM MOLESWORTH Esq of Dublin in a letter to RICHARD MOLESWORTH Esq F R S writes that he weighed the largest piece of gold in his balance both in air and waterNorth SKE T CII 0 tillW

specific gravity of another specimen to be as 13 to 18 Hence as the gold was worth 4 an ounce Mr WILLIAM MOLESWORTMI Concl udes that the specimens are full of pores and cavities which increase their bulk and that there are some extraneous substances such as dirt or clay contained in those cavities This opinion was discovered to be well founded by cutting through some of the small lumps STANESBY ALOHORNE Esq his Majestys Assaymaster at the Tower of London assayed two specimens of this native gold The first appeared to contain in qu carats 216 of fine gold i8i of fine silver 3 of alloy which seemed to be copper tinged with a little iron The second specimen differed only in holding 2 1is instead of 2468 of fine gold Major JOHN BROWN of the royal engineers transmitted to the Right Hon THOMAS PELHAM a sketch of the spot where the gold was found which Mr PELHAM has obligingly permitted to be engraved for the use of the Royal Society See Tab II CoB

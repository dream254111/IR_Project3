BY THE PLEADINGS THE ONLY REMAINING ALLEGATION OF THE DECLARATION IS THAT AFTER THE NOTES HAD BEEN DISHONORED AND NOTICE THEREOF GIVEN THEY WERE SOLD AND TRANSFERRED BY MRS T F TAYLOR TO THE PLAINTIFF IT IS INSISTED BY THE PLAINTIFF THAT SECTION 3279 OF THE CODE APPLIES ALSO TO THIS LAST ALLEGATION THE TITLE OF THIS SECTION IS  WHEN PROOF OF WRITING NOT REQUIRED UNLESS DENIED BY AFFIDAVIT FILED

IN ISSUE BY THE PLEA OF NIL DEBET JUST AS IT WAS AT COMMON LAW THE PLAINTIFF ALLEGES THAT MRS T F TAYLOR SOLD AND TRANSFERRED THE NOTES TO HIM AFTER MATURITY THIS THE DEFENDANT BY HIS PLEA OF NIL DEBET DENIES ON THIS ISSUE THE PARTIES WENT TO TRIAL AND THE BURDEN WAS ON THE PLAINTIFF TO PROVE THE CASE STATED THE ONLY EVI DENCE IS THAT OF THE PLAINTIFF WHO HELD THE NOTES IN HIS HANDS WHILE HE WAS TESTIFYING THE TITLE IN AND OWNERSHIP OF WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED BY THE ADMISLIONS IN THE PLEADINGS IN MRS T F TAYLOR AND TESTI FIED THAT HE ACQUIRED THE NOTES FROM MR T F TAYLOR THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO SHOW THAT MR TAYLOR HAD ACQUIRED TITLE TO THE NOTES FROM MRS T F TAYLOR AND NOT A WORD OF EVIDENCE OFFERED TO ESTABLISH IN ANY WAY HIS RIGHT AND TITLE TO THE NOTES THE ISSUE WAS WHETHER THEY HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED BY MRS TAYLOR TO THE PLAINTIFF THEY WERE NOT ENDORSED BY HER AND SO FAR FROM PROVING THE ALLEGED SALE AND TRANS FER BY HER THE PLAINTIFF PROVED THAT HE GOT THEM FROM ANOTHER WHO IS NOT SHOWN TO BE THE AGENT OF THE ADMITTED OWNER OR TO HAVE EVER HAD ANY AUTHORITY FROM THE OWNER TO SELL AND TRANSFER THEM 190 JULYTHE MATERIAL FACT PUT IN ISSUE WAS WHETHER THESE NOTES ADMITTED TO BE THE PROPERTY OF MRS TAYLOR HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED BY HER OR BY HER AUTHORITY TO THE PLAINTIFF THERE WAS A TOTAL FAILURE TO SUSTAIN THIS ISSUE ON THE PART OF THE PLAINTIFF AND ON THE DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE JUDGMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RENDERED FOR THE DEFENDANT FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT MUST BE REVERSED AND SET ASIDE AND THIS COURT WILL ENTER SUCH JUDGMENT AS THE SAID CIRCUIT COURT OUGHT TO HAVE RENDERED REVERSED BY THE EDITORBY INCAUTIOUSLY JOINING IN THE DEFENDANTS DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE AND SUBMITTING THE CASE TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT ON THE DEMURRER THE PLAINTIFF LOST HIS CASE WHICH WOULD SEEM OTHERWISE TO HAVE BEEN IN HIS FAVOR AT COMMON LAW THE PLEA OF NIL DEBET PUTS IN ISSUE EVERY MATERIAL ALLEGATION OF THE DECLARATION AND DEVOLVES THE BURDEN OF PROVING THE SAME ON THE PLAINTIFF THE DECLARATION IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE ALLEGED THAT THE DEFENDANT CLASON MADE THE NOTES SUED ONTHAT THE PAYEES EN DORSED THEM TO MRS TAYLOR AND THAT SHE SOLD AND TRANSFERRED THEM TO THE PLAINTIFF AFTER DEFAULT IN PAYMENT BY THE MAKER AND ENDORSERS UNDER THE PLEA AT COMMON LAW IT WAS INCUMBENT ON THE PLAINTIFF IN ORDER TO RE COVERY TO PROVE EACH AND ALL OF THESE ALLEGATIONS WE SUPPOSE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS BUT BY OUR STATUTE SEC 3279 OF THE CODE PROOF OF THE MAKING AND ENDORSEMENT OF THE NOTES THE SAME BEING ALLEGED IN THE DECLARATION IS DIS PENSED WITH THERE BEING NO AFFIDAVIT FILED WITH THE PLEA DENYING SUCH MAKING AND ENDORSEMENT THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE THE FULL EXTENT TO WHICH THE STATUTE GOES IT DOES NOT DISPENSE WITH THE PROOF OF OTHER ALLEGATIONS NECESSARY AT COMMON LAW TO BE PROVED UNDER THE PLEA IT WAS NOT ALLEGED IN THE DECLARATION THAT MRS TAYLOR THE ENDORSEE OF THE PAYEES EITHER ENDORSED OR ASSIGNED THE NOTES TO THE PLAINTIFF BUT THAT SHE  SOLD AND TRANSFERRED THEM TO HIM IF ENDORSEMENT OR ASSIGNMENT BY HER HAD BEEN ALLEGED IN THE DECLARATION PROOF OF THE ALLEGATION WOULD HAVE BEEN DISPENSED WITH BY THE STATUTE UNLESS AN AFFIDAVIT WITH THE PLEA PUTTING THE FACT IN ISSUE HAD BEEN FILED DENYING THAT FACT BUT THERE WAS IN THE DECLARATION NO ALLEGATION THAT MRS TAYLOR AFTER SHE BECAME THE OWNER OF THE NOTES AS THE DECLARATION ALLEGES EITHER ENDORSED OR ASSIGNED THEM TO THE PLAINTIFF OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON THE WORDS SOLD AND TRANSFERRED ARE NOT IT IS BELIEVED EQUIVALENT TO THE TERMS  ENDORSED ASSIGNED USED IN THE STATUTE THESE LATTER TERMS ARE EVIDENTLY USED IN THE STATUTE IN A RESTRICTED SENSETHE TRANSFER OF TITLE IN A PARTICULAR MANNERBY ENDORSEMENT OR ASSIGNMENT WHICH NECESSARILY IMPLIES SIGNATURE AT LEAST THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE THE IMPORT OF THE WORDS THEMSELVES BUT IT IS PUT BEYOND QUESTION BY THE CONTEXT SUCH ENDORSEMENT ASSIGNMENT AC CEPTANCE OR OTHER WRITING AS THE NOTES WERE ENDORSED TO MRS TAYLOR IN BLANK IT WAS PERFECTLY COMPETENT FOR HER TO SELL THEM AND TRANSFER THE LEGAL TITLE WITHOUT EITHER ENDORSEMENT OR ASSIGN MENT THIS AS ALLEGED IN THE DECLARATION SHE DID THE ALLEGATION WAS MATERIAL AND BEING DENIED BY THE PLEA IT WAS INCUMBENT ON THE PLAINTIFF TO PROVE IT THE STATUTE NOT DISPENSING WITH SUCH PROOF SO FAR FROM THERE BEING ANY SUCH PROOF THE PLAINTIFF TESTIFYING ON HIS OWN BEHALF AND HOLDING THE NOTES SUED ON IN HIS 1896 191 CLASON V PARRISHVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER HANDS WHILE HE WAS TESTIFYING THERE WAS NO OTHER EVIDENCE ON THIS POINT STATED THAT HE PURCHASED THEM NOT FROM MRS TAYLOR WHO WAS ENTITLED TO THEM ACCORD ING TO THE DECLARATION BUT FROM ANOTHER PERSON HER HUSBAND WHOSE TITLE IF ANY HE HAD WAS NOT SHOWN IT IS TRUE THAT THE PLAINTIFF MIGHT HAVE SHOWN IF SUCH HAD BEEN THE FACT THAT IN THE SALE AND TRANSFER OF THE NOTES TO HIM MR TAYLOR WAS ACTING AS THE AGENT OF HIS WIFE AND HIS ACT THEREFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERS BUT THERE WAS NO SUCH PROOF ON THE CONTRARY THE INFERENCE IS THAT MR TAYLOR WAS THE OWNER OF THE NOTES IN HIS OWN RIGHT AS THE PLAINTIFF CREDITED THE GREATER PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ON A DEBT OWING TO HIM BY THE HUSBAND FROM WHOM HE PUR CHASED HE THUS PROVED HIMSELF OUT OF COURT HE STATED ONE CASE IN HIS DECLA TION AND PROVED ANOTHER WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE ONE STATED THIS MATERIAL VARIANCE BETWEEN THE ALLEGATIONS AND THE PROOFSTHE CASE STATED AND THE CASE PROVEDWAS FATAL TO THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIM ON DEFENDANTS DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE NOTWITHSTANDING THE RIGOROUS RULES APPLIED BY THE LAW TO THE DEMUR RANT IT IS SUGGESTED HOWEVER THAT IT WAS STILL IN THE POWER OF THE PLAINTIFF TO SAVE HIMSELF EVEN AFTER THE DEFENDANTS DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE WAS TENDERED FIRST HE MIGHT PERHAPS UNDER SEC 3384 OF THE CODE UPON ASKING FOR IT HAVE OBTAINED LEAVE TO AMEND HIS DECLARATION SO AS TO CONFORM IT TO THE FACTS DEVELOPED IN THE EVIDENCE IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT THIS SECTION HAS SUBSTITUTED THE WORDS IF IT THE COURT CONSIDER THAT SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE WILL BE PROMOTED FOR THE WORDS IN THE FORMER STATUTE IF IT THE COURT CONSIDER THE SAME THE VARIANCE NOT MATERIAL TO THE MERITS OF THE CASE THE SUBSTITUTED LANGUAGE IS BROADER THAN THAT OF THE FORMER STATUTE AND WAS INTENDED TO ENLARGE THE POWERS OF THE COURT IN CASES OF VARIANCE FOR THOUGH THE COURT MIGHT CONSIDER THE VARIANCE MATERIAL TO THE MERITS YET IF JUSTICE WOULD BE PROMOTED BY AMENDMENT OF THE PLEADINGS SO AS TO CORRECT THE VARIANCE SUCH AMENDMENT WAS PROVIDED FOR SECOND THE PLAIN TIFF ON DISCOVERING THE VARIANCE MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED A NONSUIT AND IN A NEW ACTION FRAMED HIS PLEADINGS TO SUIT THE FACTS OF THE CASE IN VAIN THE NET IS SPREAD IN THE SIGHT OF ANY BIRD WROTE THE WISEST OF MEN IN THE OLDEN TIME BUT IF SOLOMON

9 1896 1 PLEADINGNVil debetProof of handwriting at common law and in Virginia Trasitfers by delivery merely In an action of debt at common law on a nego tiable note the plea of nil debet put in issue the execution of the note and all transfers thereof but by statute in Virginia sec 3279 Code when the exe cution and endorsements of the note are averred in the declaration no proof thereof is required unless the plea putting it in issue be supported by affidavit The object of the statute is to dispense with the proof of handwriting in cer tain cases and it has no application to a transfer of paper by mere delivery Upon an averment of such transfer by the wifeproof of transfer by the hus band without proof of his agency is not sufficient even on a demurrer to the evidence by the defendant to maintain the issue on the part of the plaintiff tendered by the plea of nil debet Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond rendered June 15 1893 in an action of debt wherein defendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintift in error was the defendant Reversed This was an action of debt on three negotiable notes The notes are substantially alike and the following is a copy of one of them and of the endorsements thereon 14243 RICHMOND VA Nov 20th 1888 Ninety days after date I promise to pay to the order of E E Taylor  Co one hundred and fortytwo and fortythree onehundredths in dollars for value received negotiable and payable without offset at the First National Bank of Richmond Va and we the makers and endorsers of this note hereby severally waive the benefit of our Homestead Exemption as to this debt No Due AUG CLASON Endorsed by E E TAYLOR  CO Mrs T F Taylor cancelled The declaration sets out the making of each note the endorsement thereof to Mrs T F Taylor and the subsequent dishonor thereof and hen as to each note avers that after the dishonor and notice thereof the said Mrs T F Taylor sold and transferred to the said plaintiff the said note in writing The defendant demurred and pleaded nil  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter July 188debet The demurrer being overruled and issue taken on the plea it was agreed that the following was all the evidence given in the cause The plaintiff testified as follows I acquired three notes for value from Mr T F Taylor in March 1892 paid 100 in cash for them and credited the balance of the purchase money on a debt due me by said Taylor for money I had paid for him on a judgment gotten against me as his surety The plaintiff held in his hand the notes sued on and showed them to the jury Thereupon the defendant demurred to the evidence and the court gave judgment for the plaintiff on the demurrer to the evidence and the defendant applied for and obtained a writ of error and supersedeas Hill Carter  A K Leake for the plaintiff in error Meredith  Cocke for the defendant in error HARRISON J delivered the opinion of the court The declaration in this case avers that the defendant made three several negotiable notes and promised thereby to pay the same to E E Taylor  Co or order and that said E E Taylor  Co did endorse each of said notes to Mrs T F Taylor before maturity and that after said notes had been dishonored and notice thereof given to the maker and endorsers Mrs T F Taylor sold and transferred each of said notes to the plaintiff This declaration was demurred to and  nil debet pleaded The demurrer was overruled and the plaintiff took issue on the plea Upon the trial the plaintiff testified that he acquired the three notes sued on for value from Mr T F Taylor This was all the evidence in the case and the defendant demurred to the plaintiffs evidence in which demurrer the plaintiff joined and thereupon the jury found a verdict for the amount of the notes subject to the opinion of the Court upon the law Upon consideration whereof the court was of opinion that the evidence was sufficient in law to maintain the issue joined and gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount ascertained by the verdict of the jury Whether or not there is error in this judgment is the question now to be determined by this court At common law in an action of this kind every allegation of the declaration the execution of the notes as well as all the different assignments of them have been put in issue by the plea of nil debetChitty on Bills Old Ed p 389 1 Saunders on P1  Ev p 615but under our statute sec 3279 of the Code there could be no issue as to the execution of these notes or the endorsement 1896 189 CLASON V PARRISHVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER thereof to Mrs T F Taylor because the making and endorsing to her were alleged in the declaration and there was no affidavit filed denying the truth of those allegations Under the pleading in this case on the issue of nil debet the declaration having charged that the defendant in the suit had made the notes sued on and that E E Taylor  Co had endorsed them over to Mrs T F Taylor and the plea of the defendant not being sup ported by affidavit there was no issue of fact as to the execution of these notes nor of their endorsement and transfer to Mrs T F Tay lor These facts are admitted by the pleadings The only remaining allegation of the declaration is that after the notes had been dishonored and notice thereof given they were sold and transferred by Mrs T F Taylor to the plaintiff It is insisted by the plaintiff that section 3279 of the Code applies also to this last allegation The title of this section is  When proof of writing not required unless denied by affidavit filed with plea The effect of the statute is to dispense with the proof of handwriting in actions on writings not under sealnothing more Phaup v Stratton 9 Gratt 619 The question of handwriting is not involved in the allegation of the declaration that the notes were sold and transferred by Mrs T F Taylor to the plaintiff and therefore section 3279 does not apply This last allegation is put directly in issue by the plea of nil debet just as it was at common law The plaintiff alleges that Mrs T F Taylor sold and transferred the notes to him after maturity This the defendant by his plea of nil debet denies On this issue the parties went to trial and the burden was on the plaintiff to prove the case stated The only evi dence is that of the plaintiff who held the notes in his hands while he was testifying the title in and ownership of which had been placed by the admisLions in the pleadings in Mrs T F Taylor and testi fied that he acquired the notes from Mr T F Taylor There was no attempt to show that Mr Taylor had acquired title to the notes from Mrs T F Taylor and not a word of evidence offered to establish in any way his right and title to the notes The issue was whether they had been transferred by Mrs Taylor to the plaintiff They were not endorsed by her and so far from proving the alleged sale and trans fer by her the plaintiff proved that he got them from another who is not shown to be the agent of the admitted owner or to have ever had any authority from the owner to sell and transfer them 190 JulyThe material fact put in issue was whether these notes admitted to be the property of Mrs Taylor had been transferred by her or by her authority to the plaintiff There was a total failure to sustain this issue on the part of the plaintiff and on the demurrer to the evidence judgment should have been rendered for the defendant For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed and set aside and this court will enter such judgment as the said Circuit Court ought to have rendered Reversed BY THE EDITORBy incautiously joining in the defendants demurrer to the evidence and submitting the case to the judgment of the court on the demurrer the plaintiff lost his case which would seem otherwise to have been in his favor At common law the plea of nil debet puts in issue every material allegation of the declaration and devolves the burden of proving the same on the plaintiff The declaration in the principal case alleged that the defendant Clason made the notes sued onthat the payees en dorsed them to Mrs Taylor and that she sold and transferred them to the plaintiff after default in payment by the maker and endorsers Under the plea at common law it was incumbent on the plaintiff in order to re covery to prove each and all of these allegations We suppose there can be no doubt about this But by our statute sec 3279 of the Code proof of the making and endorsement of the notes the same being alleged in the declaration is dis pensed with there being no affidavit filed with the plea denying such making and endorsement This would seem to be the full extent to which the statute goes It does not dispense with the proof of other allegations necessary at common law to be proved under the plea It was not alleged in the declaration that Mrs Taylor the endorsee of the payees either endorsed or assigned the notes to the plaintiff but that she  sold and transferred them to him If endorsement or assignment by her had been alleged in the declaration proof of the allegation would have been dispensed with by the statute unless an affidavit with the plea putting the fact in issue had been filed denying that fact But there was in the declaration no allegation that Mrs Taylor after she became the owner of the notes as the declaration alleges either endorsed or assigned them to the plaintiff or to any other person The words sold and transferred are not it is believed equivalent to the terms  endorsed assigned used in the statute These latter terms are evidently used in the statute in a restricted sensethe transfer of title in a particular mannerby endorsement or assignment which necessarily implies signature at least This would seem to be the import of the words themselves but it is put beyond question by the context such endorsement assignment ac ceptance or other writing As the notes were endorsed to Mrs Taylor in blank it was perfectly competent for her to sell them and transfer the legal title without either endorsement or assign ment This as alleged in the declaration she did The allegation was material and being denied by the plea it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove it the statute not dispensing with such proof So far from there being any such proof the plaintiff testifying on his own behalf and holding the notes sued on in his 1896 191 CLASON V PARRISHVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER hands while he was testifying there was no other evidence on this point stated that he purchased them not from Mrs Taylor who was entitled to them accord ing to the declaration but from another person her husband whose title if any he had was not shown It is true that the plaintiff might have shown if such had been the fact that in the sale and transfer of the notes to him Mr Taylor was acting as the agent of his wife and his act therefore would have been hers but there was no such proof On the contrary the inference is that Mr Taylor was the owner of the notes in his own right as the plaintiff credited the greater part of the purchase price on a debt owing to him by the husband from whom he pur chased He thus proved himself out of court He stated one case in his decla tion and proved another wholly inconsistent with the one stated This material variance between the allegations and the proofsthe case stated and the case provedwas fatal to the plaintiffs claim on defendants demurrer to the evidence notwithstanding the rigorous rules applied by the law to the demur rant It is suggested however that it was still in the power of the plaintiff to save himself even after the defendants demurrer to the evidence was tendered First he might perhaps under sec 3384 of the Code upon asking for it have obtained leave to amend his declaration so as to conform it to the facts developed in the evidence It will be observed that this section has substituted the words if it the court consider that substantial justice will be promoted for the words in the former statute if it the court consider the same the variance not material to the merits of the case The substituted language is broader than that of the former statute and was intended to enlarge the powers of the court in cases of variance for though the court might consider the variance material to the merits yet if justice would be promoted by amendment of the pleadings so as to correct the variance such amendment was provided for Second the plain tiff on discovering the variance might have suffered a nonsuit and in a new action framed his pleadings to suit the facts of the case In vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird wrote the wisest of men in the olden time but if Solomon

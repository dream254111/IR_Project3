By the Rev W Lax A M Lowndess Professor of Astronomy in the University of Cambridge,i206954,74 1 VII A Method of inding the Latitude of a Place by Means of two Altitudes of the Sun and the Time elapsed betwixt the Observations By the Rev W Lax A M Lowndess Pro fissor of Astronomy in the University of Cambridge Read January io 1799 I HOPE the following method of determining the latitude by means of two altitudes of the sun and the time elapsed betwixt the observations will be found not less convenient for nautical purposes than the rules which are commonly employed But I would rather recommend it in those cases where rigid accu racy is required and the astronomer is provided with no better instrument for taking the suns altitude than a HADLEYS sextant of the most improved construction The process will be neither difficult nor tedious and if the observations are made with proper exactness I conceive the latitude will generally be ob taimed within a few seconds of the truth With these expecta tions I have ventured to reduce the method into its present form and submit it with the utmost deference to this learned Society In thespherical triangle whose sides are the complements of the latitude declination and altitude let z represent the angle at the pole and t its tangent Z the azimuth and T its tangent L the la titude and  its cosine radius being unity then if the altitude and declination remain constant we shall have L  TA 1 and con sequently L will vary as T  when the increment of A comMr LAXS Method offtiding the Latitude of a Place c 75 pared with x itself is inconsiderable Hlence if the abscisse of the curve ABCD fig i be always pro Fi G portional to z and its ordinate to T the area GB intercepted betwixt any two of these or dinates may represent the increment of the latitude corresponding to the increment of the time EG Let abcdd fig 2 be another curve whose abscisse ae is always equal to AE in the preceding figure but whose ordi A 3 nate eb isl proportional to t the tangent of the hourangle then will the area gb vary FiG  as GB at small distances from the meridian and of course may represent the increment of the latitude Now to prove this we have only to shew that T and t when both are small bear to each other a given ratio a g e Let S and Y be the sine and cosine of the azimuth s and T the sine and cosine of the angle at the pole then will  Z IFL and tZ   Z    and z  But since the 1 t 0 complements of the declination and altitude remain constant whilst the latitude is made to vary S will be to s as S to s T S  TZ I and therefore we shall have  tx l w X   T1 i  t l the square of the secant of the azi muth the square of the secant of the hourangle which may be considered as a ratio of equality when the angles are very small Tile fluxions therefore of the tangents are as the tan gents themselves and consequently they must always preserve the same ratio towards each other Let us now suppose that L276 M lZr LAXs Method offnding tbe Latitude of a Plac an altitude of the sun is taken at the distance ae from the merit dian but that inl consequence of an error in the assumed latitude the calculated time is ag and that with a lat differing from the former by one minute we computeagain and the time is found equal to a then will the area g be to gb as one ra nute to the whole error in latitud 6e L  et another al titude be taken at the distance ae from noon and let the times com puted with the two differeant latitiudes that were employed be fore be agi and af then inthis case likewise the areagc will be to the area gb as one minute to the errorin latitude Now the latter curve is the fgra tangenliur7 whose quadrature is given by COTES in his Harnmonia M3ensurarum and the ex pression for which is extremely simple For the fluxion of the area is  and the area itself log 1o og Se cant of the angle at the pole The difference of the log secants or log cosines wili of course be equal to the area intercepted betwixt the tangents which correspond to them Hence a table might easily be constructed with a double argu mentthe distance from noon and the variation in time arising from the different suppositions of latitude which might imme diately exhibit the logarithm of the area corresponding to any particular base eg supposed to be given A second table mnight have for its argument the difference of the logarithms of the area gb and the area gi which is likewise conceived to be known and discover at once in degrees minutes and seconds the cor rection to be made in the assumed latitude This correction

method8 beMret ceived with approbation and in the mean time it is proposed to subjoin a short specimen which is already completed I have presumed that we are able to determine eg the error in time arising from an error in the ss2umeI latitude at either of the observations and hence it becomes necessary before we can avail ourselves of the principles which have been laid down to point out the manner in which this ray be accomplished TLhe clock gives us the whole interval betwixt the observations sup posed L to be lmade on different sides of the meridian equal to ae  ae and by computation we obtain ag  g and thence we deduce eg  eg the whole error in time Now the area gb is equal to gb aand therefore if we make atrough divi sion of the whole error without anly regard to accuracy in the inverse ratio of the hourangles at the two observations and entering the first table with thesetimes mark the area corre sponding to each at their respective distances from nloon and increase the one and diminish the other equally till we get the areas of the same magnitude this we may conclude is the prop per value of each If the table were constructed to every second of time we might ascertain these ogarithmic areas merely from inspection but as it will be advisable to confine it within narrower limits we shall sometimes find it necessary as in other tables to deduce their ultimate value by the rule of three When we have increased oneportion of time and diminished the other till the difference of their corresponding areas becomes a mznimum we must divide this difference betwixt them in the proportion Of78 Mr LAXS Metbod of finding the Latitude of a Place their respective increments in the next interval of time and sub tract or add the part  assigned to each according as it is greater or less than the other The table however might easily be carried to such an extent that exactness in this division could never be required but on the contrary it would be quite sufficient when the hourangles were nearly equal to add the areas together and take half the sum for the value of each From these principles may be deduced the following practical rule for determining the latitude of a place When the sun comes within fifteen degrees of the meridian in the morning let his altitude be taken and the time of the observation be accurately marked and let another altitude be taken after he has passed the meridian whilst his distance from it is less than fifteen de grees and let the time of this observation likewise be noted Then with the supposed latitude of the place compute the times corresponding to each of the altitudes in terms of the log cosi of the hourangle and take the difference of the intervals shewn by the clock and determined by calculation and divid it betwvixt the observations in the manner explained above Compute the log cosine of the houraIngle a second time with the greatest altitude and the latitude increased or diminished by a minute according as it appears fromn a comparison of the intervals to have been too little or too great and take the dif ferencel betwixt this log cosine and that wlhich resulted from the first operations when the same altitude was employed Having thus obtained the two areas gb and Lgc we must subtract their logarithms from each other and with their difference entering the second table we shall find theA degres minutes and seconds by which the assumed latitude is to be increased or diminished It will be needless perhaps to suggest that in the higherby Means of two Altitudes oJ thde Sun 79 latitudes we may extend the limits above specified a few degrees farther from the meridian without offeringany mantrial violence to the theory as it has hitherto been explained xand that on the other hand when the declination and latitude are nearly equal and of the same denomination it whill be expedient to confine our observations within a much shorterdistance from noon But it will afterwards be demonstrated that whatever be the magnitude of the hourangles or however nearly the lati tude and declination may approach towards each other we can always secure with very lifttle additional trouble an exact conclusion We may remark that the latitude determined in this mman ner will be nearly equivalent in point of accuracy to the mean result of two meridian altitudes For we know that the incre ment of latitude  increment of altitude radiuscosine of azi muth and since the cosine of a small angle differs so little from the radius this may be  considereds within the limits which I have prescribed as a ratio of equality If therefore one altitude of the sun were taken and wevould ascertain the error in time arising from an error in the assumed latitude without the aid of a second observation the latitude would be discovered with nearly the saie precision as if it had been de duced from the meridian altitude But by means ot a second obseravationr made on a different side of noon we obtain a second error fin time of the samekind and this being added to the former and their sum divi ded in a just Iroportion he twixt the two observations the same effect wilblhe produced with respect to the accuracy of the result as if two latitudes had been deduced from meridians adltitudes an1d a mean be twixt them had been takenSo Mr LAXT Meldbpd Of findins the Latituddeof a Place I might perhaps be allowed to say more for I am satisfied from experience that I can take an altitude of the sn with greaterexactness When he is in any other situation than when he is upon the meridian If we culd ascertain within a few seconds or even within a minute thetimne when he attains his greatest altitude there would thenv be no reason why an ob Servatioon should not be made with the same degreeiof cer vtainty in this as in other cases but we are generally obliged to keep our eye stedfastly fixed for several minutes upon the two images and it is well known that in such circum stances the best eyes are apt to be deceived Besidesj it is im possible to preserve the contact of the limbs by perpetually moving the index whilst the sun continues to ascend so very slowly We are compelled to wait till they are evidently sepa rated and then by one turn of the screw to bring them into contact again which must necessarily be a source of some inac curacy It is for the first of these reasons that in taking an altitude of the sun when he is near the meridian I have found it advisable hot inhthe usual manner to bring the images almostto touch each other and then to wait till they actually do so but to bring them at once into contact with such a de gree of velocity as would make them sensibly overlap or sepa rate whilst the clock beats a second But I consider it as oneof the principal advantages of this method that wve can availourselves of any number of altitudes and of course approximate as near as we please to a true conclusion with so little additional labour If there be an equal number of observations made on each side of the meri dian we must combine them together by pairs according to the preceding instructions and thus determine the differentby Means of two Altitudes of the SunZ 8 logarithmicvvalues of gb Having then added them all toge ther and taken a mean betwixt them we have only to come pute a single incremental area gc with any of the altitudes and the lat varied one minute and subtracting its log from the mean logvalue of gb we shall obtain a very accurate cor rection of the assumed latitude But if there be more obser vations on one side of the meridian than on the other when all the pairs have been united and the areas resulting from them found we may combine the supernumerary observations on either side with any of those which are made on the opposite side The properest however for this purpose is the observa tion which is made at the least distance from the meridian I should hope moreover the practical astronomer will think it a circumstance of some moment that the principal part of the work consists in finding the timne an operation which he is obliged so frequently to perform Any of the three methods which are usually adopted upon this occasion might easily be applied to the tables which have been described but I iII venture to recommend a different rule which I conceive to be better adapted to our purpose than any of the others and to which thedirections before given had a particular reference Let a be the sine of the altitude y the cosine of the hour angle d the sine  the cosine and r the tangent of declina tion I the sine X the cosine and s the tangent of the latitude adl a dl  ars a Then  ars r 5 S when radius is unity but i rs when radius is m x  into the square of the tangent of the arc whose se  3 4cant is d o Hence we deduce the following rule for deters MDCCXCIX M82 Mr LAxs Method of fn the Latite of a Place mining the log cosine of the angle at the pole From the log sine of the altitude increased by three times the log radius sulbtract the sum of the log sines of the latit and dedinatioin take half of the remainder and coMsidering it as the log secant of an arc find the log tangent corresponding multil this by 2 and add the log tangents of the latit and declin and reject thrice the log radius the sum will be the log cosine of the angle required But when the declin and latit are of a different denomination it is evident that our expression be comes m  ad  l3 which is equal to 4 X  into the square of tle secant of the arc whose tangent is fr In this case therefore having found the log value of a and divided it by 2 we must consider the quotient as the log tangent of an arc whose log secant being taken we are to proceed as in the former case The advantages of this rule are obvious We obtain the angle in terms of the log cosine and consequently when we have calculated the second time with the new latit we have only to subtract one result from the other and we imme diately determine the area corresponding to the difference of the times Besides in the second computation fewer of the elements are changed by this rule than by any of those which are usually employed and this is a consideration of much imp portance But if we are disposed to adopt the following method of ascertaining the in cremental area gc this advantage will be found still greater Let us resume the expression adl I dx ia Ad be  and we shal hav ty  beby Means of tw Altitudes of the Sun 83  d I ing the succeeding value of x  x dAxza Ix d1A dxx adl I taking x positive instead of negative as it ought to be when i is positive s  s  and consequetly 2 1 2Z S  wvhen radius is unity btit a 2 i  v when radius is in Sy NI Now may be considered as the increment of the hyperbolic log of y and therefore with its proper modulus may represent the area which is the object of our investigation We may sup pose the other side of the equation to bethe square of the co sine of the arc whosegsine is 9i x  into the increment of the hyperbolic log of AX divided by the square of the radius and if instead of taking this log with the hyperbolic we take it with BRIGGSS modulus we must then consider Y as the in crement of the log of y according to the same system But 1 being equal to s when L is only one minute it will vary as s and therefore if its value be determined according to BRIGGss system When s is equal to radius and be denominated v its value in any other case will be expressed by v24 Hence to obtain the log of the area gC the quantity with which we are immediately concerned we must find the log value of  and divide it by  we must then take out the log cosine of the arc whose log sinie is equal to the quotient and having multiplied it by owe must add the product to the constant log of v 310ol5 and the log tangent of the sup M 284 Mr LAxs  Method of fiding the Latitude of a Place posed latitude rejecting thrice the log radius But if rmZ be greater than radius which must necessarily be the case when the azimuth is greater than a right angle we must then consider Z ml as the square of the tangent of the arc Sr whose secant is 5 observing in other respects the direc tions before given The quantities r and s are both employed in the first computation from the result of which we also ob tain y and consequently this operation will not be attended with much trouble The above instructions it is manifest are given upon the supposition of r and S having the same sign but if the declin and latit should not be of a similar denomination then will our expression becomem1 m  and we must consider fl2  rS 1 as the square of the secant whose corresponding Sy tangent is rm With this exception the process will be the same as when the tangents r and s are both affirmative The preceding formula naturally suggests to us another method of finding the log area gc and as some perhaps may think this more eligible than either of the former I shall take the liberty of explaining it When the latit is given the area G C it is obvious must invariably preserve the same mag nitude at all distances from the meridian and consequently the area gc which is proportional to it must likewise remain constant If therefore we can ascertain this area when the hourangle is supposed to vanish we may employ it when the sun is at any distance from noon  Let us now conceive the declin to be equal to nothing then will our expressionby Means of two Altitudes of the Sun for the area gc become A and consequently since the tan gents of the azimuth and hourangle vanish in the ratio of their sines or of the sines of the opposite sides in the triangle alluded to before we shall have the area GC  t when the sun is upon the meridian  But this area is always the same when the latitude is given whatever be the suns declination and therefore may always be represented by AV X v i and the area g  will be generally expressed by x cos of merid galtit i x cos of medltit when the hourangle does not exceed the limits cos of declin which have been recommended Hence if we add together the constant log 31o15 the log radius and the log cosine of the merid altitude and subtract from their sum the log cosines of the latit and declin we shall obtain the log value of gc It will be necessary perhaps to meet anl objection which some may be inclined to urge against the method of deducing the hourangle in terms of the cosine when this angle is very small But it should be recollected that with the angle itself we have no immediate concern the accuracy of our conclusion depending entirely upon the accuracy with which the area cor responding to any particular incrrement of time can be deter mined Now this area whatever be the suns distance fMrm the meridian will be nearly proportional to the increment of the latit and consequently its magnitude is totally unconnected with that of the hourangle A given error in the quantity which expresses this area will equally affect our conclusion whether the angle be 2 or whether it be 2o degrees But let us inquire what effect will actually be produced by admitting86 Mr LAXS Method of finding tlae Latitu f a Place an error of half an unit in each of the logcosines whose dif ference is equal to the area gc and of course in some instances an error of an unit in the area itself upon any partie cular supposition of latit and declin We have only toascertain the ratio which this area bears to unity for the same ratio will the correction of the latit bear to the error in our re sult If the latit for instance be 50o and the decline lo on the same side of the equator with the latit then radius being L unity Z the increment of the hourangle will equal rp g being the sine of the hourangle and Cos 5 0oX L 9 the cos of the altit s x i t minutes nearly when z is t and we have seen that at any other dis tance from the meridian the incremental area will be of the same magnitude Hence subtracting the log cosine of SO from that of 5c 11 o we get the difference equal to 1238 and consequently the error in our approximation will be to the error in the assumed latit as I1 9238 when the log cosines are carried to seven places of decimals But when the zenith distance of the sun at his greatest altit is very small and there is moreover a considerable uncer tainty with respect to the latit this error will probably become of more importance and we may find it necessary to guard against it Now it is manifest that by diminishing the mul tiple which the area gb is of the area gc exactly in the same proportion we shall diminish this error and I shall afterwards explain in what manner it may be accomplished The same expedient is also calculated to prevent another species of inacoby Means of two Altitudes of the Sun 87 curacy to which under similar circumstances our process is liable If we are desirous of knowing how much our conclusion is affected by substituting the tangent of the hourangle for the tangent of the azimuth it may be done with the greatest faci lity We have seen that the area GC fig 1 is to GB as one minute to the error in the assumed latitude But our method supposes that gc fig 2 is to gb as one minute to the correc tion required and we must therefore estimate tle difference betwixt these ratios in order to ascertain how far the ap proximlation is inaccurate Let EGm x FG and then since GC may be considered as FG and GB 2 D  GD EB GD  EB x EG  x m x FG the former ratio will 2 GDED equal G x m  according to the notation employed above m T mm  m 2 nearly  the minutes contained in the computed

equal to m 2 mi nutes of a degree Let the assumed diff from the true lati tude ten minutes z e let m i a then Qwill the error amount to half a second and if we suppose m a 3o the error will not exceed four seconds If instead of varying the assumed latitude one minute we vary it n minutes in calculating the area gc the above ex 11   2  m I Zgr n 2sr s pression will be transformed into m zL 2L  2r  1 00000 S r the increment of the latitude being in this case n L The error will consequently vary as m m  n when the declinaa tion latitude and time of observation are given and if we suppose the real to differ from the assumed latitude p minutes p  I p npn this last expression will become P  np  7 which varies as itnn when p remains constant and of course n the error may be diminished in any proportion by diminishing this quantity PLn  Now the increment of the latitude is al ways x T z and therefore since z is determined by the process explained above we have only to ascertain the value of T in order to approximate nearly to p But the sine of theby Means of two Altitudes of the Sun 89 azimuth is  k which is known and consequently the tangent may likewise be obtained Having thus discovered a near value of p or of the error in our first assumed latitude we are enabled so far to correct it in our second hypothesis and in a much greater degree to reduce the error in our conclusion As it will sometimes though not often be necessary to have recourse to this expedient two short tables might be added in order to facilitate the operation The first might contain the log cosines to every degree from the ith to the goth of the quadrant and be so contrived as likewise to exhibit the log sine of any arc as far as the 75th degree expressed in minutes and seconds of time that by subtracting the log cosine of the altitude from the log sine of the hourangle the cosine of de clination being considered as equal to radius we might obtain the log sine of the azimuth This should be made one of the arguments of the second table the other being the cosine of the latitude to every five degrees of the first sixty of the quadrant and the table should give us the value of 15 x A To hich mul tiplied into the minutes contained in the error of time would determine with sufficient exactness the quantityp We might indeed with the same facility compute the fourth table accord ing to the mean value of the cosine of declination if it could be supposed that such a degree of precision would ever be required Perhaps it would be advisable for the mariner in order to avoid all distinction of cases to calculate in every instance his incremental area with the lat vried ten minutes instead of one and then he would always be secure of a result sufficiently correct for his purpose In the case supposed above if the real MDCCXCIX N9o Mr LAX sMethod of finding tbe Latitude of a Place were to differ from the assumed latitude 30 minutes the error in his conclusion would not exceed the fourth part of a second We must observe that if n the approximate value of p thus deduced be the minutes by which the first assumed lat is varied in our second hypothesis we ought to multiply the cor rection after it is taken from the 2d table by this quantity but as n is always supposed to be a whole number the addi tional trouble arising from this process can never be an object of the smallest consideration The 2d table however may be as conveniently applied to the case where the lat is varied ten minutes as where it is varied only one The loga rithms which form the argument are the same in both cases except that the index in the former is less by unity than in the latter Another species of inaccuracy originates in our conceiving the fluxion of the lat to vary as Tz instead of x Tz  and it may be useful to ascertain how much our conclusion is affected by this circumstance We suppose in fact that the incre ments of the lat corresponding to the finite times gf and ge are to each other as the areas g c and g b drawn into the co sine of the first lat whereas in strict propriety they are to each other as the sum of all the elements of these areas drawn into the cosines of the latitudes belonging to each i e if ge  rn X gf we consider these increments as being in the ratio ofgcxXgbxAinsteadof gcx gbx Hence 2kh  mX gb b  I    g c m Alc12 S L rads i 2gg 2 gb  n

will scarcely amount to a single second But if either the cosine of the latitude should be so small or the difference betwixt the supposed and true latitude so great as to render this error of any importance we may prevent it by the same means that were recommended in the preceding case In computing the incremental area gc we must correct our first hypothesis respecting the latitude with the assistance of the third and fourth tables and for the reasons assigned above the cause of this inaccuracy will be removed There is still another part of our process which will some times be the source of a small error We are directed to dis tribute the whole increment of the time betwixt the two obser vations by equalizing the areas corresponding to each in the figura tangentium whereas they can only be considered as perfectly equal in the original curve whose ordinates are the tan gents of the azimuth It is supposed in reality that gc bears to GC the same ratio which gc bears to GC or which is nearly the same thing that gd is to GD as gd to GD we must therefore estimate the difference betwixt these ratios and we shall easily deduce the amount of this error Let us retain the notation employed above and moreover let r represent the cosine and r the tangent of the hourangle at the observation farthest from noon A the difference betwixt the hourangles and y the excess of y above r

same kind and one of the alti tudes be taken at the distance of Aft the other at the distance of e from the meridian this error will amount to TI oth part of the whole difference betwixt the real and the assumedby Means of two Altitudes of the Sun 93 latitude Hence if this difference be ten minutes the error in the approximation will not be more than 7th part of a second and if the difference be one degree the error will only be six times greater than in the former case It will therefore always be inconsiderable except when the latitude and declination are nearly equal and on the same side of the equator But if this cause should be likely to produce an effect of some importance we may prevent it by computing an incremental area with the least altitude likewise and the latitude increased or diminished by a minute and then taking a mean betwixt them both for the magnitude of the area gc Thus wve shall generally obtain a conclusion sufficiently exact but if we are desirous of rendering it perfectly so in every instance we must divide the difference betwixt the real and apparent in tervals in such a manner that the areas assigned to the two observations may be to each other in the same ratio as their correspondent incremental areas This divisionwill be readily dispatched by making the difference betwixt the logarithms of the two first terms in the proportion taken from the 1st table equal to the difference betwixt the logarithms of the two last which are given when either of the formulae mW  41 v m cos of merid alt K orA cosof id lt  is employed but must be found if the first method of computing the area gc be adopted Suppose that a and b representing the logs of the areas gb and gb in the table appear from inspection to exceed each other nearly as much as the logs of the areas gc and gc let c and d be the two next terms in succession and let m and n be the logs of the quantities expressing the incremental areas then will94 Mr LAXS Method of finding the Latitude of a Place a bc da bM n a c the quantity to be added to or subtracted from a to make it of the required mag nitude We have then only to subtract m from this corrected value of a to proceed with the remainder to the second table and take out the corresponding error in the assumed latitude This precaution however can very seldom be necessary and even when it is deemed advisable to adopt it the division may be performed with so little regard to exactness as to render the process easy and expeditious But we are not to conclude that  because this inaccuracy and also the two first species that were considered are likely to be introduced when the latitude and declination are nearly equal and of the same kind they will therefore unavoidably exist in these circumstances On the contrary they may always be pre vented when the weather is favourable by making the observa tions within a smaller distance from the meridian We have only to wait till the increase of the suns altitude becomes so slow as not to produce a visible separation of the limbs in two or three seconds and then we may be assured that the azimuth is small and consequently that none of these errors will be consi derable I have hitherto supposed that this method is only to be adopted when the sun at each observation is within fifteen de grees of the meridian or to speak more accurately when both the azimuth and the hourangle are so small that we may consider their tangents as bearing a given ratio to each other and indisputably these limits should never be transgressed when it can possibly be avoided for we have seen page 79th that whatever be the method employed the smaller theby Means of tuio Altitudes of the Sun 9 hourangle the greater is the exactness with which the lat is determined Sometimes however it will be impossible to make both or perhaps either of our observations within the distance which I have recommended but even in these cases our rule may be conveniently applied It has already been demon strated that we can never be subject to any material error in consequence of the inequality of the areas g b and gb except when the zenithdistance of the sun at his meridian altitude is very small and for this case an effectual remedy has been pro vided We need not therefore make any farther remarks upon this species of inaccuracy But perhaps it will be imagined that because we still continue to suppose the areas of the figura tain6entium to represent the increments of the latitude a considerable error will be in troduced Wecan easily prove however that in consequence of the increment of the time being so much diminished by increasing the distance from noon this error will seldom be of moment enough to claim our attention Let T be the tangent of the azimuth and r the tangent of the hourangle at the ob servation farthest from noon then it follows from what has been demonstrated before that the ratio of gb to gc will ex ceed the ratio of GB to GC and consequently the ratio of gb to gc supposed to be of a proper magnitude by ml  m r  2 rS L Hence it is evident that by diminishing one of these ratios and increasing the other as we are directed in the present case till they become equal we augment the latter by a t portion of this difference expressed by tX and on this ac u t wl bt re2rS count it will be made too great by M r T96 Mr LAxs Method of fding

whenever it is judged necessary to guard against this species of error we need only diminish the value of P in the last expression and this will readily be effected by dividing the difference betwixt the real and computed intervals of time in such a manner that the portions belonging to the two obser vations may be to each other inversely as the quantities taken out of the fourth table according to the instructions before deli vered When the portion belonging to the greatest altitude is thus obtained we can immediately deduce the correction to be made in the first assumed latitude and then proceed to calculateby Means of two Altitudes Of the Sun 97 the incremental areas Let us suppose for instance the difference betwixt the intervals to be q and the quantities deduced from the 4th table to be a and b then will a  the minutes by which ab the former latitude is to be varied If however there be any considerable uncertainty respecting the latitude I would recommend the following method of ob taining an approximate value of it before we begin the process for investigating its real magnitude This will effectually prep dcude in almost every instance the various errors that have been described The increment of the altitude is equal to x Sz and therefore when the azimuth is so small that its sine varies nearly as the arc the whole increase of the altitude whilst the sun is moving to the meridian will be Az x i  LZA the sine of the hourangle being considered as equal to the arc itself Now the first of the two tables which have just been explained will enable us to find the value of g by subtracting the log cosine of the altitude from twice the log sine of the hourangle and a third table might be added to furnish us with the whole expression  according to the mean value of As one of its arguments being the quantity 4 already determined and the other the supposedlatitude It might perhaps beadvisable to add another column to the firstof these tables containing twice the logarithmic sine of the hourangle as this would in some measure abridge the operation We should find it more conve nient too if the last table were to give us the complement of the arc whose value is 2 rather than the arc itself because it MDccxc3xe 098 Mr LAXS Method of fdgthe Latitude f a Place would then only be necessary to subtract the observed altitude from this complement and we should immediately deduce the zenith distance of the sun when he had arrived at the meridian This being ascertained we should have no farther difficulty in finding the latitude to be adopted in the subsequent computation The exactness of the conclusion which4 is derived from this pro cess will necessarily depend upon the degree of certainty withW which the time is given when the observation is made An error in time may arise both from an irregularity in the going of the clock and a small inaccuracy in estimating the diffiwencebe twixt the longitude of the place where the altitude is now taken and that where the time was last determined but these causes it is evident can seldom be very considerable We may gene rally I think be sure of the time within two or three minutes The principle upon which this approximation depends will open to us a more compendious way of finding the area g b and which may always be pursued with advantage when one of the altitudes can be taken at a small distance from the meridian In the higher latitudes indeed the hourangle may amount to five or six degrees but when the latitude and declination approach towards an equality and are of the same denomination this angle must be restrained within narrower limits If instead of deducing the meridian altitude from the altitude observed according to the directions before given we consider it as being actually equal to the meridian altitude and employ the latitude resulting from this hypothesis in computing the hourangle this angle must necessarily be found equal to nothing We may therefore spare ourselves the trouble of performing this part of the operation and need only calculate the time belonging to the second obser vation which is supposed to be made when the sun is at a greaterby Means of two Altitudes of the Sun 99 distance from the meridian The error in the assumed latitude will in this case be equal to the whole increase of the altitude betwixt the time of observation and n1oon and from this consi deration we may be enabled in any particular instance to dis cover at what distance from the meridian this plan may be safely adopted We can extend it also to any number of observations that happen to be made within the proper limits by connecting them successively with one on the opposite side of the meridian and thus determiini ng the areas gb corresponding to each lav ing afterwards calculated an incremental area with any of the assumed latitudes varied one minute we must subtract its loga rithm from the logarithmic value of each of the areas gb and wee shall discover by means of the second table the correction to be applied to each of the supposed latitudes But the method which has just been explained might always be safely adopted within the limits prescribed to the former rule if in computing the incremental area we were to employ the latitude obtained by means either of the 3d and 4th or of the 8d and 5th tables This precaution would entirely prevent the error which might arise from the inequality of the ratios of GC to GB and gc to gb when the difference betwixt the real and the assumed latitude was very considerable The error which is occasioned by the disparity of the hourangles might be obviated by the same means that were practised in the first meth0d There is only one objection indeed to this rules being exclusively adopted when either of the altitudes is taken within the distance at first recommended It would be neces sary in that case to extend the table much farther than we are obliged to do if we adhere to the former rule but the labour is so much abridged by this plan that I am dQubtful 00oo Mr LAxs Method of Jdg the Latitude of a Place whether its advantages might not be more than sufficient to coMr pensate this inconvenience Thetable should at least be carried to such a length as would enable usto pro ee6d in this mranner whenever an observation was made whin five orsix degrees of the meridian I must not forget to observe before I conclude the theory that although I have directed the altitudes to be taken on different sides of the meridian it is by no means requisite that we should inva riably adhere to this preept We have seen thef reason indeed why it is expedient in mbst instances to prefer this mthod as being generally calculated to produce a much greater degree of exactness in the result This however is not always the case for if one of the observations be made beyond the distance originally prescribed it is of little importance whether the second altitude be takenon the same side of the meridian or not But it will sometimes be impossible to make the observa tions on different sides of noon and hence it becomes necessary to inquire in what manner the real latitude may be discovered inr these circumstances The clock gives us the interval betwixt the observations equal to ae ae and by computation we find ag and ag and thence weV deduce eg eg the difference be twixt the errors in time Having then assumed without any regard to accuracy two portions of time corresponding to the  two observations whose difference is the same as the difference betwixt the errors before determined and which are to each other in the inverse ratio of the hourangles we must increase or diminish them both equally till we get the areas in the first table of the same magnitude and then we may conclude that we have obtained the proper value of each The directions which have been given for the prevention of errors in theby Means of two Altitudes of the Sunm ci former case when the altitudes are taken on different sides of the meridian are very easily accommodated to the present and it would therefore be superfluous to bestow any farther consideration upon them From a review of the inaccuracies to which this method in particular cases may be liable it appears that none of them can ever be of sufficient importance to affect the mariner If he only computes the time with each of the altitudes and the latitude by account and an incremental area with the greatest altitude and the former latitude varied ten minutes the correction will generally be deduced within much less than a second and in the most unfavourable circumstances within a minute of the truth But the astronomer in every instance even when the latitude and declination are nearly equal and of the same kind by adopting the precautions which have been recommended may be assured of a result perfectly exact If however he should entertain any doubts upon this point he might easily compute a second value of the incremental area with the latitude already determined and this it is evident would necessarily produce a conclusion not less accurate than if it were obtained from the direct method The most satisfactory way of proving the utility of this rule will be to suppose a particular latitude and declination with these to compute the altitudes when the sun is at two given distances from the meridian and thence to deduce the latitudee by an application of our own principles EXAMPLE I Let the latitude be 5e 27 50 north and the declin wheni the first altit is taken 2 An 121 and when the

an approximate value of p page 89 by means of the 3d and 4th tables and compute an incremental area with the least as well as with the greatest altitude If this plan had been pursued the latitude would have been ascertained within less than a second of the truth Or if the weather had been favourable we might have prevented the error as effectually by making the observations when the hourangles were much less and approached nearer to an equality N B The log sines and tangents of the declin and lat to be employed in all the operations should be taken out at the same time But when the first method of computing the incremen tal area is adopted we may avail ourselves with considerable advantage of the following expedient Instead of taking the whole log sine and tangent of the new lat take the increments of each or the difference betwixt their respective values in the two suppositions and find the increment of the log tangent corresponding to the increment of the log secant t This may readily be effected when the log tangent is deduced from the log secant in the former process by taking the rate of in crease belonging to each and thence inferring by an easy pro portion the proper increment of the log tangent in the latter case The difference betwixt this increment and the increment of r is the value of the area gc An instance of the method thus improved shall be given in the

have demon strated above can never be necessary except when the zenith distance at noon is very rsmall The error of three seconds arises from a different cause and might have been entirely excluded

nSut  REMARKS i All the altitudes that are taken on the same side of noon tend only to correct the error which may be supposed to exist in the greatest of these altitudes and can have no effect in removing any inaccuracy to which the greatest altitude on the other side of the meridian may be subject Hence we must take more than one altitude on each side of noon if we are desirous of obtaining a very exact conclusion 2 When some of the observations are made in the morn ing and others in the afternoon the smaller the hourangle in every instance the more favourable it will be for our purpose But if we cannot procure an altitude on each side of the meri dian we ought to make one observation when the hurangle is as large as possible and with this all the rest should be se parately combined We must be cautious  however not to let the sun be too near the horizon lest the apparent altitude should be affected by the uncertainty of the refraction A If the clock were to furnish us with the true time we might combine together any two observations made within the proper limits without applying to the first table and deduce a very exact correction Should there even be a Ismall error in the supposed time we might still proceed in the same manner without being liable to any material inaccuracy provided the difference betwixt the hourangles was not very considerable The error indeed occasioned by adopting this method of find ing the two areas and taking a mean betwixt them for the value of g b may easily be determined in any particular case If t and t be the respective tangents

been an error of a single se cond in the conclusion 4 If the time were determined by equal altitudes and one of them were to be employed in computing the area g b it is manifest that we should entirely exclude the error which has just been considered It would be necessary however in order to correct by the second observation any inaccuracy that may have occurred in reading off at the first

Place This process will require very little explanation The first co lumn contains the observed double altitudes as they were read off from the sextant the second contains the corresponding times given by the clock the third contains the times from noon determined with sufficient exactness by taking half the interval betwixt the first and last observations in which the altitudes are equal and supposing this to be the time elapsed betwixt the first observation and the sungs reaching the meri dian The fourth column is formed of the log cosines of the hourangles taken immediately from the argument of the first table and the last column exhibits the latitudes deduced from every two corresponding altitudes and is intended to shew the agreement betwixt these results It is not necessary that we should employ the tables in this operation for we may take the log cosines of the hourangles from TAYLORS Logarithms after the time is reduced into de grees minutes and seconds and by dividing the area gb 7537 by the area gc 203 the natural number belonging to the log 33081 we shall obtain the correction requiredTABLEJI o Zl oz l 0 3 6 093 I 0 1 lZ 1 2g l 3611 I 4S 20 2 12 999 21z z 21 I3 3

THE TABLES Tab I This table contains two arguments One is the dis tance of the sun from the meridian which is expressed in hours minutes and seconds and also in terms of the log cosine of the hourangle This argument is placed in the first column The second stands at the top of the table and consists of the minutes and seconds contained in the error of time The table itself exhibits the logarithm of the area gb corresponding to any given error at any particular observation But it was necessary to give the log value of this area in both directions from the tangent gd i e both when the computed is greater and when it is less than the real interval of time These two values are included in the same column but are separated fromby Means of two Altitudes of the Sun 19 each other by a point The first quantity expresses the log area in the latter the second expresses it in the former case Thus for instance in the fifth column we have i36io8 and we are to understand that the log of the area gb is equal to 156 when the computed time is too small and equal to io8 when the computed time is too great The argument at the top is carried to every twelve seconds of time or every three minutes of a great circle  and should be continued as far as four or five minutes of time for the first twelve or fourteen degrees from the meridian as far as three minutes for the next ten degrees two minutes for the next ten degrees and so on the time being diminished as the tangent of the hourangle increases as far as sixty or sixty five degrees beyond which the table need not be extended The argument in the first column should be carried to every eight seconds of time for the first twelve or fourteen degrees and to every twenty seconds for the rest of the table Tab II This table consists of two columns The first contains the differences betwixt the logs of the area gb and gc when the latit is varied one minute in calculating the in cremental area These differences are negative as far as the fourteenth because so far the areagc exceeds the areagb In the second column are exhibited the errors in the assumed latit corresponding to these differences Tab III This table is composed of four columns The first contains the computed distance in time from noon the second the altitude of the sun the third the log sine of the hourangle or the log cosine of the altitude expressed in the first column and the fourth twice the logarithm in the formeri2o Mr LAXs Methodof findig the Latitudea f a Place c column being intended to save us troble of multiplying by 2 when we are finding the logarithm of At  Tab IV In this table there are two arguments One of them occupies the first column and consists of the log sines of the azimuth which are found by subtracting the log cosine of the altitude from the log sine of the hourangle as they stand in the preceding table The other argument is placed at the top of the columns and is formed of the assumed latitude The table is designed to exhibit the product of the taangent of the azimuth multiplied into the cosine of the latit and into 15 so that by taking out this quantity and multiplying it into the minutes contained in the error of time we may at once deter mine how much the assumed latit is to be varied in computing the incremental area Tab V There are two arguments in this table likewise That which stands in the first coltumn is the log value of A obtained from the second table by subtracting the log cosine of the altitude from twice the log sine of the hourangle The second argument which is placed bove the columns is the supposed latitude The table itself contains the compleent of the meridian altitude at the place of observation

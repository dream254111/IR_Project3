shipment though he may not be in possession of the bill of lading On this point the court said The sixth instruction states that Unless the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was the holder of the bill of lading for the goods at the time this suit was commenced June 24 1913 they must find for the defendant This instruction is based upon the Carmack Amendment which read as follows That any common carrier railroad or transportation company re ceiving property for transportation from a point in one State to a point in another State shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor and be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss damage or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier rail road or transportation company to which such property may be delivered or over whose line or lines such property may pass and no contract receipt rule or regulation shall exempt such common carrier railroad or transportation company from the liability hereby

Classical Library London William Heinemann New York G P Putnams Sons 1917 pp xxii 620 150 This is another unit in that Loeb Classical Library which is doing so much to contradict the asser tion that the dead languages and their literature are no longer with us Truth to tell however only a couple of decades ago a volume with the text of Caesars Commentaries on one page and a tolerably literal translation on the other confronting the first the whole served up as an honest book and not as a subterranean trot  would have produced wrath among the schoolmasters even now it may excite the doubts of the timorous To all however who really desire that the cause of the classics should not be lost it becomes a most valuable reenforcement The interests of Latin studies are decidedly advanced when a good translation of Caesar is hailed as a guide and not as a bandit Mr Edwardss translation of the eight books of the Gallic War has been well executed It is very much superior as a piece of English as well as being founded upon a considerably better text to the old Mc Devitte and Bohn translation of ancient date in the familiar Bohn library The language is smooth and easy although sometimes possibly a little too diffuse to carry over the compact phrases of the Latin The translation however compares very favorably with the recent version by T Rice Holmes I have not been able to compare it with the other modern attempt by F P Long The Gallic War constitutes a fairly selfinterpreting narrative Mr Edwards provides very few notes and those of only one or two lines each In an introduction and two appendixes however he undertakes to supply sufficient explanatory apparatus to make the story intelligible to the much beset average reader In frankness it must be said that this apparatus is less satisfactory than the translation It is too brief to be always lucid and Caesar is too great a man to have his genius summarized and disposed of in one and a half small pages Further more the appendix on the Roman army although containing a great amount of compact information yet in the constant attempt at brevity sometimes commits itself to general statements which seem open to so many exceptions as to make them misleading to the uninitiated One gets the impression that this apparatus was prepared rather out of a sense of duty than as an essential part of the volume428 Reviews of Books On the other hand the maps nine in number are excellent and some of them seem decidedly superior to the corresponding maps that are inserted in the ordinary  Caesar texts  in our highschools WILLIAM STEARNS DAVIS The Gradutal Acceptanice of the Copernican Theory of the Universe By Dorothy Stimson PhD New York Baker and Taylor Company I9I7 pp I47 I25 This intelligent and entertaining little study sketches the rise of the heliocentric theory from the Greeks onward as well as its advocacy by Copernicus and its vicissitudes down to our own day That in so vast a field she has used but a part of the litera tureshe has missed even books so important as those of Pierre Duhem goes without saying but she has moused to excellent purpose and has handled her materials with insight and sound sense That the volume is a thesis for the doctorate may perhaps be inferred from the  PhD  following the authors name and the thanks in her preface show the book an outcome of the teaching of Professor Robinson at Columbia It may be warmly commended to the American editors whose ready acceptance of the denial that theology has ever hampered science has of late made some of us rub our eyes There is of course in the work much that testifies to the authors immaturity but what most tempts to censure is a carelessness in the minutiae of the scholars workin punctuation in the spelling of for eign names in the quoting and the abbreviation of titles in the reading of proofwhich though some effort has clearly been given to these shows a lack in the training fairly to be expected in the holder of so advanced a degree Copernician is almost as frequent as Coper nican  and a writer who is happily not yet  the late President White  will be puzzled by the ascription to him of a History of the  Welfare  of Science But such slips though not few are slight flecks in so live a book Its last forty pages are devoted to a bibliography and to trans lated extracts from Ptolemy Copernicus Bodin and the Louvain pro fessor Feyens G L B The Revival of the Conventual Life in the Church of England in the Nineteetth Centtury By Ralph W Sockman MA New York the Author I9I7 pp 230 Mr Sockman makes it clear in his preface that no field work in England was done for his sympathetic study of the revival of the conventual life in the Church of England in the nineteenth centurythat all the research was done in the libraries of New York This is evident again at several places in the book itself for there is a complete absence of any local color when Mr Sockman is describing the life of the conventual establishments in urban communities and in rural England that have come into existence since I847 To some extent this lack of local description impairs the value of the book forMinor Notices 429 it is difficult to realize to the full the mission which these conventual establishments assigned to themselves without some description of their environment and the local conditions urban or rural that surrounded them This much said nothing but commendation remains for Mr Sockmans interesting study of a comparatively new phase in the life and service of the Established Church in England He has moved into a field that hitherto had had very little systematic tillage and his work in this new ground has been singularly successful His history of the thirty conventual establishmentsall connected with the Church of Eng landthat came into existence between I847 and i899 is an excellent piece of work These establishments are likely to extend themselves or to be added to from time to time for the war will almost certainly have its influence on the movement of which Mr Sockman writes with so much sympathetic care The second half of the book may thus before long come to need revision and addition But the first half is so com plete so comprehensive and so thoroughly well done that it will long stand as a really serviceable contribution to English ecclesiastical his tory and incidentally to the history of some aspects of English thought and social life from the Restoration to the early years of Queen Vic torias reign The remarkable care with which Mr Sockman has traced and described the various influences and forces working towards a revival of the conventual life under sanction of the Established Church obviously gives the book this permanent value There is a bibliography of twenty pages but no index British Foreignt Policy in Europe to the End of the Igth Century A Rough Outline By H E Egerton MA Beit Professor of Colonial History and Fellow of All Souls College Oxford London Macmillan and Company I9I7 pp x 44o 6 sh If the people are not instructed in history as a result of the war it will not be the fault of the scholars At any rate the supply of manuals larger or smaller covering mainly recent history but some of them reaching back into a longer past has been greatly multiplied in the last two years Professor Egertons book is among the shorter of these manuals and it is addressed to the better informed among general readers It must be judged not by what one should expect of a complete history of British foreign policy but by its avowed purpose It is in the first place plainly stated in the preface to be a book  dealing with British foreign policy apart from a narrative of events  To this purpose the author keeps surprisingly close with the result that those who are not familiar with the events or who do not accompany their reading with a narrative history will find much that is blind to them The object of the book is to show the motives and purposes which have guided British foreign policy and to do so as nearly as possible in the words of the men who have had most influ ence in shaping the policy It contains therefore numerous extracts especially from the speeches and letters of statesmen and diplomats in430 Reviews of Books which they have urged or defended their ideas The student and the teacher will find in this the greatest usefulness of the book It is a chronological index to the sources where will be found the best and most authoritative statements of intention and motive made by the men who determined events in this field and it gives to ones hand what we may conclude to be the most telling of these statements In the second place the object of the book is frankly a defense of British foreign policy Professor Egerton is marshalling the evidence which shows that the policy of the country on the whole has been singularly honest and straightforward p 2 The book certainly gives that impression and not by glozing over the bad spots No real defense is attempted of the action of England in seizing the Danish fleet in I807 or her part in bringing on the Crimean War or in the settlement at its close and the best that can be found to say for the Spanish war which began in I739 is that  its real raison detre was alto gether rational the expansion of British trade and shipping  It may be added that such an interpretation of British foreign policy as we are here given would have been impossible fifteen years ago because the revelation which has been made of Germanys plans of world empire throws back a light upon all that happened at least since the begitining of the struggle with Louis XIV which enables us now to see connections and consequences before obscure and changes the rela tive emphasis to be given to items in the code of international ethics Origins of the Triple Alliance Three Lectures By Archibald Cary Coolidge Professor of History in Harvard University New York Charles Scribners Sons 19I7 pp Vi 236 I25 This volume is a development of the BarbourPage Lectures for I9I6 at the University of Virginia Its outstanding merit is lucidity of presentation and in this respect the book considering its small compass and the involved nature of its subject is a model of exposition Professor Coolidge divides it into three chapters following the main episodes which marked the de velopment of Bismarckian diplomacy from I87I until I882 The first sketches the state of international relations in I87I and the beginnings of the League of the Three Emperors a fine sense of dramatic values has led the author to conclude the chapter with the warscare of I875 which is the first presage of Bismarcks ultimate failure to transform the league into a solid alliance The second chapter is devoted to the Eastern crises of I876i878 As might be expected Professor Coolidges treatment of Balkan and Turkish affairs is the liveliest and most in teresting portion of his work upon it he lays particular emphasis for it was in the Near East that the conflicting interests of Russia and AustriaHungary became inexorably clear and that Bismarcks original dream of an alliance of empires was finally shattered The third chapter shows us Bismarck compelled to choose between Russia and Austria presents the reasons for the chancellors preference for the latter powerMinor Notices 431 as an ally and describes his ultimate decision to substitute Italy for the former For the most part the author does not depart widely from the generally accepted interpretation of events he makes it clear that the combination of the three empires was Bismarcks real preference and that the Triple Alliance as finally formed was a pis aller he is frank in recognizing that Bismarckian policy from I876 to I878 was a fail ure to the role played by Andrfassy he ascribes greater importance than historical writers have usually accorded We may regret that Professor Coolidge has chosen to make his style quite so severely pragmatic and that he has not given his personal opinions at greater length especially in the case of the Balkan settle ment of I878 The ordinary student would also have been grateful for a list of authorities other than the few referred to in the sparse foot notes The note on page 2I9 which gives the date of the publication of the text of the Triple Alliance as i883 instead of i888 is obviously a misprint Devant lHistoire Causes connues et ignorees de la Guerre Par Paul Giraud Docteur en Droit Paris BergerLevrault 19I7 pp xix 263 3 fr 50 The descriptive subtitle of this book is hardly accurate for the author does not attempt to introduce any warbreeding factors which have not already received careful attention by many writers and the major portion of his work is devoted merely to an analysis of the diplomatic negotiations which failed to prevent the conflict His sources of information are restricted almost entirely to the official multicolored documents issued by the governments of the warring nations all of which have been dissected and analyzed many times The manuscript was obviously prepared before the revelations furnished by the Rus sian trials of last spring and by the publication of the Kaisers telegram of August IO I9I4 to President Wilson M Girauds study is none the less an excellent example of careful and exact analysis and should not be regarded as superfluous It is more scholarly in method than Becks The Evidence in the Case and more convenient for the general reader than the longer analyses contained in Headlams History of Twelve Days and Stowells Diplomacy of the War at the same time it is more complete than the excellent but brief Qui a voulu la Guterre of Durkheim and Denis M Giraud has also included a brief discussion of the German theory of Einkreisung a criticism of the German claim to a place in the sun and an illuminating collection of dicta illustrating the frame of mind characteristic of typical German rulers warriors publicists and pastors The conclusions reached are identical with those now generally held in this country The author does not insist that the German government knew in advance the exact terms of the Austrian note of July 23 but he considers it certain that German diplomats were aware of its general character and therefore must stand responsible for the consequences He believes that during the course of the crisis Ger432 Reviews of Books many played a consistently hypocritical role and that when Count Berchtold changed his tone on July 30 and declared his willingness again to take up conversations with Russia Germany destroyed this last chance of a peaceful settlement by her utterly unjustifiable ulti matum to Russia The book is evidently issued as part of a campaign of patriotic edu cation and may serve as a model to those American writers who are anixious that our nation shall know the truth about the war The authors language in his verdict of German guilt is strong but he takes care to give chapter and verse to support each of his conclusions England and the War i9i4i9i5 By Andre Chevrillon With a Preface by Rudyard Kipling Garden City and New York Doubleday Page and Company I9I7 pp XXi 250 i6o The war has been a revelation of England to the world and to herself and of the world to England For many years there has been a rather general feeling out side of England and to a considerable extent within England as well that there had taken place a decided decline of her national vigor and spirit that she would be found very reluctant to enter upon a great war and would be proved by a war to have become more or less degenerate The Boer War which was in some important ways a preparation for the present war should have proved this belief unfounded but Eng lands military difficulties and military failures in that war obscured the evidence In a quite different direction and unconsciously in this case England was out of harmony with the world or with the greater portion of the world Without reasoning about it and without exhortation or reso lution she had gone some distance ahead of most other nations in the application of the standards of individual morality to national action A great change had slowly come about in this respect in half a century whose roots lie much farther back in the past Because this change had been so gradually coming about it was not clearly understood either at home or abroad Particularly did England fail to understand how far Germany had lagged behind herself As M Chevrillon says The war had found her in ignorance and apathy she knew nothing but herself she hated nobody she did not even know she had enemies hardly knew the full meaning of that word During the last ten years those who governed and represented England had done their best to preserve the peace nay had been inspired by purest pacifism All their political activity had been directed towards the ideals of humanity fraternity and justice Germanys longaccumulated hatred and envy burst out with such brutality that England was at last awakened from her dream of idealism p 223 England now knows the world and she knows her own strength and the world knows herMinor Notices 433 It is the story of this awakening that M Chevrillon tells His book is not history in the technical sense But it is the raw material of his tory and of the greatest value It is the account of an eyewitness who watched the process under the best of conditions with every facility given him and with a keenness of insight equalled by few political ob servers The French quickness of understanding and ability to put oneself in anothers place come here to the advantage of the future his torian The theme of the book is really how an unprepared democracy gets itself ready to meet on equal terms a prepared autocracy and it is doubtful if in general or in detail the description will ever be better done The story of the discoveries and experiences which led up to con scription is especially significant and instructive and takes up half the book but in other things also the growth and power of public opinion the reasons for Englands slowness in getting under way the doubtful and changing attitude of labor the author is equally illuminating The account closes with the end of the year I9I5 G B A Balfoour Viviani antd

in chronological order the coming of these commissions and their speeches and doings in the United States and Canada which are followed by a chapter on the arrival of the first American forces in England and France There is no preface so the purpose of the booka record of events or merely a pleasant patriotic excursioncan be inferred only from the contents The writers sources are mainly the news columns of the daily papers together with some references to the Cotgressional Record and Canadian Parlia mentary Reports Newspaper  clippings  it would seem should hardly be given un edited to posterity They could not include in this case much that was of importance concerning these visits hence the record is neither com plete nor accurate We read however  The distinguished visitors were offered lemonade in tin cups and buttermilk in sanitary paper cups  p I45 and As the crowd passed the Equitable Building someone sent down a shower of paper that looked like confetti  p 237 Such trivialities prevent the reader from appreciating properly the Italian appeal for coal or the Russian declarations of policy Much indeed of value in regard to the state of mind of all our Allies could be gleaned by carefully winnowing the speeches of their representatives and had the compiler assisted us better in this process we should have appreciated his book more Its chief worth would have been that it made easily AM HIST REV VOL XXIII28434 Reviews of Books accessible and inspiring the statements of the commissioners but this the author has not fully succeeded in doing Index and

and Company I9I7 pp vi 3IO 250 This book is called a character sketch but it is really an excellent political biography The author is I take it a Boer who has hardly forgotten the Jameson raid but is thoroughly committed to the English connection although no Anglophile We have been goinig very fast in South Africa Smuts once said It has been a progress marked by bitter controversy and Smuts has been in the midst of it His campaigns his addresses his political programmes and their effect upon the public upon his party and the opposition these are the matters of the biography The author uses speeches and the press commnents upon them in such a way as to bring out the strength and weakness of this great South African and does it so deftly that one scarcely real izes where praise ends and blame begins If his account is chronolog ical he never forgets that he is attempting to explain Smuts the polit ical Smuts in particular Boswell was not more interested in Doctor Johnson He makes a good case for Smuts but the passing months prove increasingly that a good case can be made It is a pity that he takes so much for granted Familiar himself with the intricacies of South African politics he is too sure that his many allusions will be understood He might well at several points have made an analysis of party groupingsfor which he is qualified as few men To test his accuracy would be impossible short of London or Pretoria His sources are the South African newspapershe has not overlooked the cartoonsand a close personal acquaintance with Jan Smuts But his pages evidence such restraint he is so dispassionate in dealing with controversial matters where he must have earnest convictions he has used so many materials where he might have been tempted to write from memory that one gains confidence in him The work gives one the flavor of South Africa It is not only the racy English idiom enlivened with fresh South African phrases nor the imagination that loves to play with odd figures of speech drawn from the authors own experience and plays with them like a Meredith some times possibly too daringly it is the insight into the Boers the sympa thetic insight of a man who has seen a wider world only to estimate his own better Few men in their lifetimes have been so fortunate in their biographers as General Smuts WALLACE NOTESTEINMinor Notices 435 The Rcbirth of Russita By Isaac F Marcosson New York John Lanie Companiy I9I7 PP XVi 208 I25 True to its Foreword  this volume is  frankly journalistic and has no  serious historic preten sions  It is one of the many appearing and yet to appear no doubt Upon this momentous theme Unfortunately for the writer especially in a journalistic narrative he did not reach Petrograd till after the Great Upheaval was an accomplished fact when he  found the capital delirious with freedom  He was obliged to accept from others the narration of the events of those long dark uncertain days the prel ude of the Revolution as well as of the Revolution itself and in con trast with other journalists living on the spot was in this respect at a great disadvantage Such a journalist would not have misjudged for inistance the amount of revolutionary sentiment and the freedom with which it was expressed in Petrograd just prior to the outbreak as is to be seen on page 35 et seq in this volume There are a few other inac curacies which may be set downl just as probably to misprint as for instanice ArchProtagonist  on page 22 where it is likely the opposite was initended Those who have followed these absorbing events in the press fromn day to dayand who has notwill be especially grateful for a more rationalized and consecutive account in book form than the daily press cotuld possibly afford This volume makes it easier to comprehend the existence of German influenice at court and the means of accomplishing its purpose While one cannot without a knowledge of the Russian psychology comprehend the establishment of the dual government the abolition of the death penalty in the army the dismissal of their most valued and trusted leaders in the midst of war and the deliberation with which they set about the wellnigh impossible task of constructing a new and untried form of government during such a crisis the turmoil is at least fascinating and the narration thereof spite of our impatience with their inaction is most thankfully received The reader has reason to be grateful to this volume also for the pen portraits of the really great men who have come to the front in this world drama especially Miliukov Rodzianko Lvov and Gutchkov and other members of the first provisional government His characteriza tion of Kerensky as a great leader does not seem to be borne out by his account of the man nor are we ready to say yet that this will be the verdict of history We seem to be still waiting for the great leader six months after the emergence of Kerensky and the Bolsheviki with whom he must be always associated This sentence in the opening paragraph of the concluding chapter carries a muchneeded and welldeserved assurance to this side of the water  A people who could show restraint when a long and poignant past cried out for vengeance are capable of still greater things J E CONNER436 Reviews of Books The Amterican Inidiats North of MIlexico By W H Miner Cam bridge University Press 19I7 PP xi I69 ioo Specialists are so seldom willing to devote any attention to the production of popular works that attempts on the part of nonprofessionals to meet the need for such publications should be treated leniently In the present instance we are able to be more than lenient because Mr Miner has been well advised in his choice of authorities and has escaped most of the pitfalls into which other wouldbe popular writers frequently fall As he has compressed his treatment into i69 small pages it is apparent that although he has confined himself to that part of America north of Mexicoall that is attempted is a popular primer the merest taste of the snbject something to give the lay reader a little glimpse into the lives of those peoples who preceded us in the occupation of the western conti nent and it must be viewed only in that light A work of this kind might be handled either in a series of general discussions of the material culture sociology mythology and so on of the peoples of the area taken as a whole or in the form of a bundle of specific descriptions of certain selected tribes Mr Miner however has chosen a middle course After a brief introduction in which he out lines the physiographic background of American Indian life he begins the main part of his task with a short chapter in which certain  Gen eral Facts  regarding the origin and distribution of the Indians are set forth and follows it with a longer account of Indian Sociology At this point he suddenly shifts to the specific method in discussions of the Plains Indians and the Indians of the Southwest but in his final chapter on Indian Mythology he reverts to the generalizing method Some notes a very good bibliography and an adequate index close the volume While a methodological mixture of the above kind in a work of this character has much to recommend it it would have been better had the specific narratives been appended to the general discussion instead of being sandwiched into the middle of it The former would also have been improved considerably by a chapter on material culture and eco nomic life Yet with all this and in spite of occasional errors and some awkwardness in expression Mr Miner has produced a very readable booklet which may be used by the lay inquirer with comparative safety JOHN R SWANTON Apprentticeship anad Apprenticeship Education in Colonial New Eng land anid New York By Robert Francis Seybolt PhD Assistant Pro fessor of Education in the University of Wisconsin Teachers College Columbia University Contributions to Education no 85 New York Teachers College 19I7 Pp I21 ioo The title reveals accurately the character of the book After an introductory chapter on English ap prenticeship Professor Seybolt traces from such records as laws in dentures and wills the development of the institution in colonial New England and New York He emphasizes apprenticeship not so muchMinor Noices 437 as trainiing for a trade but as a means for providing a general elemen tary educationi His main contention is that apprenticeship was the most fundamental educatiolnal instittution of the period  p 22 The first chapter is written with apparent care and fortified with many references to sources But it furnishes no real contribution to historical knowledge all the points emphasized have been covered by other writers Of specific assertions one at least may be called in ques tion the statement that by I400 apprenticeship  was practised by most gilds and required by most towns p 4 The evidence furnished drawn chiefly from London records certainly fails to substantiate this statement Succeeding chapters more valuable in content are inferior in style Not only is the writing heavy but it is diffuse and involved Oft quoted indentures weary with their sameness see pp 29 34 5859 88 89 and appendix A Certain material in the text should have been condensed put in the footnotes or omitted Failure to stummarize im portant poilnts confuses the reader From a windinlg and thorny path however Professor Seybolt finally conles into the Promised Land In the last and best chapter his findings emerge froml the obscurity of muddy style He brings out the signifi catnce of the Massachusetts Bay Act of I642 a departure from English precedent  the first comptulsory education law in America p IO5 He shows how the example of Massachusetts in making masters respon sible for the elementary education of their apprentices either personally or through local schools was followed in other colonies It may indeed be questioned whether  the apprenticeship system took care of the enltire problem of public elementary education during the coloniial period p 107 parents as well as masters had to provide instruc tion But in general his conclusions are of real value not only to the specialist in the history of education but to the student of social and economic coniditions in the colonies as well JONATHAN F SCOTT Tlhe Life of Robert Hare ait Americant Chemist I78II858 By Edgar Fahs Smith Provost of the University of Pennsylvania Phila delphia and Lonldon J B Lippincott Company I917 PP viii 508 5oo Robert Hare was born in Philadelphia in 178i he studied chemistry unider Woodhouse at the University of Pennsylvania in i8i8 he was appointed professor of chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania a position which he held for twentynine years he died in i858 eleven years after he gave up teaching There are some poinits about Hares career which appeal to the student of history and psychology Hare was admittedly the best chemist of his day in America and he was a man who wotld have raniked high in any country at any time In spite of that his nlame is practically unknown today and few people would kniow anything about him if it were not for this biography Sometimes438 Reviews of Books a man ranks high among his contemporaries without ever doing any thing striking which should be referred to by succeeding generations btut Hare was lnot of this type When only twentyone he invented the oxyhydrogen blowpipe which gave the highest temperature then known anid which is a regular piece of laboratory apparatus today We might just as well call it the Hare blowpipe as to speak of the Bunsen lamp and the Btunsen cell but Bunsens name has come down to us and Hares has not If Hare had been born in Germany his name would be known today in connection with the blowpipe The difference seems to be that Bunsen had many students who published articles while Hare had very few Hare also invented two pieces of electrical apparatus the calorimotor and the deflagrator which were marked improvements over any bat teries then in use and which enabled him to work at very high tempera tures In addition he built an enclosed electric furnace which was promptly forgotten and was reinvented many years later Although a brilliant experimenter Hare did not succeed in doing anything which was wanted then It was Davy who isolated sodium and potassium and it was Faraday who worked out Faradays law Hare did brilliant work with his electric furnace making calcium carbide graphite etc but people were not interested in such things then Hare was in many respects the precursor of Moissan though a much more brilliant man than the latter Moissan was born at the right time however and will be known for a long time on account of his electric furnace work be cause his efforts have been followed up Hare was born too early and his work led to nothing If we call Moissan the Christopher Columbus of the electric furnace we must call Hare the Leif Eriksen of the same

Cambridge Mass Harvard Uni versity Press I917 Pp 225 I25 These letters from a fine officer of the regular army are a valuable addition to the firsthand literature of the Mexican War The title is somewhat misleading for one is almost halfway through the volume before Scott is overtaken and the earlier part is not inferior in any way to the later With the exception of the fighting at Monterey which occurred while Captain Smith was absent on leave all the striking incidents of Taylors operations from the sojourn at Corpus Christi to the battle of Buena Vista are included and we are given the only detailed account of Worths unduly hurried march from Saltillo to  the Brazos  Under Scott the author fought at VeraMinor Noices 439 Cruz but missed Cerro Gordo because of going on an expedition up Alvarado River of which he gives the best account His command was not at Contreras but he distinguished himself at Churubusco and at the next battle Molino del Rey he fell mortally wounded Many sub jects besides battles however are touched upon One of the striking features of the letters is the writers appreciation of beautiful scenery On page 23 he speaks of the Nueces as winding through the prairie like a blue ribbon carelessly thrown on a green robe and many fine descriptive passages c g pp 68 74 I40 2I0 remind us that profes sional soldiers are by no means mere fighters Like other excellent offi cers the captain feltand no doubt with justicethat honors did not always fall to the most deserved p I55 but was determined to do his duty in spite of that utnpleasant fact In his opinion of the volunteer forces also he concurred with other competent regulars pronouncing them expensive unruly unreliable though sometimes brave in battle and too frequently a terror to the inhabitantsin all of which minus a certain allowance for the regular army point of view he was right The reader of these as of all other such documents must ask himself here and there whether the writer was in a positiont to know the truth of what he believed alid said and by doing so will avoid accepting some errors For example it is stated p I32 that Santa Anna had his miniisters

contributtes a handsome introductioln JUSTIN H SMITIHI Old Roads outt of Philadelphtia By John T Faris Philadelphia and London J B Lippincott Company I9I7 pp xix 327 400 This book aptly compares the old roads leading from Philadelphia to the wvings of a fan stretching otut into the country to south and west and north The topography of the country renders this inevitable In early days of settlement the most of the Quakers and Germans were farmers and such roads were needed to convey produce to the city for consump tion and shipment  Near these roads residences and inns naturally were placed and a large number of these buildings remain in a good state of preservation Some old inns have been converted into spacious dwelling houses architects skillfully harmonizing old and new Around many have grown up traditions of history and of personal experience dating back to colonial or revolutionary times Brandywine Valley Forge German town and others have a national significance440 Reviews of Books The old simple architecture has been largely preserved and has set the style for many modern residences The farmers houses of the dis trict within twentyfive miles of Philadelphia of from IOO to 200 years ago have been reproduced with many expensive variations in the sub urban residences of wealthy Philadelphians There is thus both in old and new an atmosphere of the past along these roads which is easily noticeable Often out of sight however on side roads and in beautiful valleys are old farmhouses which date back to I700 or thereabouts These have been improved by each generation by additions to buildings or planting which reveal the fact that these homesteads coming down by will from father to son from the days of William Penn have been the homes of a body of hereditary yeomen almost unknown elsewhere in the country The Civil War and the years which followed broke up this succession in many cases but the houses still remain So far as relates to the eleven roads and their surroundings Mr Faris has done his work well The writer of this review has lived in part of this territory since his boyhood and can testify to the substantial accuracy and in general the judiciousness of the selection of material for his descriptions There are some omissions which individuals locally interested may regret but such will be reassured by the new matter drawn from

field this book is a work of very great excellence Local histories and es pecially local histories dealing with certain classes or races are prone to jump at conclusions and to show little of the scientific historical spirit From such a fault the history under consideration is refreshingly free It is based on an examination of the Richmond city archives most careful and exhaustive on books on newspapers and on the statements of living witnesses of character and credibility A book of the sort makes one feel that the lives of men are not so entirely writ in water so evanescent as they sometimes seem to be for in the moderate com pass of a single volume the authors have presented the lives of all the Hebrews of any note at all who have been connected with Richmond Jews have played a prominent part in the life of the city from its very inception among the first business men who came to turn the insignifi cant village of Revolutionary times into the trading town of the nine teenth century were a number of Hebrews Several of them rose to wealth and distinction And since the early period men of note like Sir Moses Montefiore and Sir Moses Ezekiel have lived and worked inMinor Notices 44I Richmond not to mention the famous lawyer and statesman Judah P Benjamin who of course directed the Confederate foreign policy from this city And there are scores of other men and of women in the pages of the history who have left their mark on the community The authors imbued with a high ideal of historical accuracy have left no labor un spared to make their work complete and a good deal of matter which is of value in throwing light on general social and business conditions in Richmond has been included One feature of interest is a list of Con federate soldiers of Hebrew blood who entered service from Richmond or who were connected with the city in after life The part played by Jews in the military and civil concerns of Richmond all through the niineteenth century is given in great detail as well as the history of the various synagogues a matter of less interest to the general reader Mr Lichtenstein who largely conducted the research is a North Carolinian and the author of a number of good papers on the early history of his state Mr Ezekiel the coauthor a newspaper man of experience has put the book in a readable style which is to be highly commended All in all the work might serve as a model for this particular kind of his tory writing H J ECKENRODE Economlic anid Social History of Chowait Coutnity North Carolina 1880i9i5 By W Scott Boyce PhD Assistant Professor in Eco nomics in the Connecticut College for Women Studies in History Economics and Public Law Columbia University vol LXXVI no I New York Columbia University I9I7 PP 293 250 In this volume Dr Boyce portrays the life and customs of Chowan County in i88o and in I9I5 sets forth the main causes of the remarkable economic anid social changes which took place between those dates and points out the principal factors  which so long delayed the economic de velopment of a region of such enormous possibilities He treats his subject uinder four general heads I Elements of Economic and Social Life II Development of Economic Life III Development of Social Life IV Conclusions to which he appends twentyfour statistical tables The various phases of the subjectagriculture fish ing mantufactturing lumbering communication and transportation labor alnd wages education sanitation and hygiene religion social customs are all discussed with the initimate knowledge derived from personal association and close observation The author is at his best in describing social customs though at times multiplicity of details obscures the pic ture perhaps however this is unavoidable His statements of facts are generally accurate but it is doubtful to say the least whether there can be found in Chowan County any woman who thinks that  any use ful work whatsoever ill befits a lady pp I53 256 whether Drink ing in those days i88o was a mark of gentility  p I97 Nor are the authors conclusions always convincing The lack of ready capital442 Reviews of Books for instance certainly played a larger part in the economic conditions of Chowan County in i88o than the author seems disposed to concede the conclusion that the timesystem which he so justly condemns is the child of slavery pp 25I252 is certainly open to discussion Again the conclusion that negro women are withdrawing from domestic service because they have absolutely no protection from being grossly insulted by white men that the more educated and refined she the negro woman is the greater the efforts made by white men to seduce her pp I53I54 is so far from being justified by the facts that one can scarcely exercise proper selfrestraint in referring to it Improved economic conditions which enable negro men to support their wives and daughters who are thus able to devote themselves to their own families and domestic affairs and these alone are responsible for the withdrawal of negro women from the domestic service of white families In spite however of these and a few minor faults such as occasional flippancy in treatment and the use of slang expressions e g local sheet for local newspaper p I87 an eighteenyearold for a blushing bride p i89 Dr Boyce has produced an interesting and il luminating

Jacob Van der Zee Codification of Statute Law in Iowa by Dan E Clark Interpretation and Construction of Statutes in Iowa by 0 K Patton the Drafting of Statutes by Jacob Van der Zee the Committee System by Frank E Horack and Some Abuses connected with Statute Lawmaking by Ivan L Pollock The book constitutes a complete review of legislative organization and operation in Iowa and is the first comprehensive study of a state legislature although too little attention is given to the governors share in legislation The monographs maintain a high standard of excel lence although one feels that some of them have been written rather from printed records than from firsthand observation of legislative activities The first monograph in the volume that devoted to the his tory and organization of the legislature contains much useful informa tion but reads in places more like a catalogue than a treatise Dr Van der Zees study of the form and language of statutes in Iowa is especially well done and gives useful illustrations of practices common to all state legislatures To the reviewer Dr Horacks study of the committee system is also of distinct interestMinor Notices 443 A sttudy such as that in the voltume under review has the merit of giving the facts in detail upon a specific problem but it has the disad vantage of viewinig the local situation with too little reference to similar problems presenting themselves elsewhere A broader view for ex ample would probably have led to a less hostile view of subcommittees p 564 An erroneous statement is made regarding the extent of the powers of state governors to veto items in appropriation bills p 652 One to some extent familiar with Illinois legislative developments in recent years may perhaps be permitted to question the

Rev H N Herrick DD and William Warren Sweet Professor of History in De Pauw University Indianapolis W K Stewart Company I9I7 pp 363 xii 250 This work was projected by the Rev Horace N Her rick of North Indiana Conference in I9IO He was able to give five years to collecting material which he did with marvellous industry and intelligence Dr Herrick died in I9I5 whereupon the work of digesting this material and of preparing it for publication was committed to Pro fessor William VV Sweet of DePauw University a practical writer of history with special knowledge of Methodist matters The outcome is a worthy memorial of a great religious movement and a significant con trilution to the social history of a sovereign state There were Meth odist itinerants in what is now the state of Indiana as early as i8oi The first organized pastoral charge however dates from I807 It is estimated that the entire Methodist following at that time so far as membership lists made record did not exceed twenty souls What there was of supervision for the small and scattered Methodism in Indiana was given by the stronger organizations in Kentucky and Illinois The growtlh of the church was rapid In i832 the membership is reported at 20000 and Indiana Conference was organized In i844 this conference with a membership of 67000 was divided into the Indiana Conference and North Indiana Conference the latter beginning its his tory with a membership of 28ooo In I9I6 this last named single con ference reported a membership of 88ooo while the total Methodist membership in the state is reported at 262000 Moreover the religious movement was supplemented by educational and philanthropic enter prises which have served to extend the influence of the denomination far beyond denominational lines DePauw University for instance wlhich now has over seven hundred students and over one million dollars worth of property and the Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis which receives patients regardless of denominational affiliation Professor Sweet shows in a most convincing way the intimate bear ings of religion upon social movements notably those dealing with the abolition of the slavetrade and of the liquor traffic He notes also the444 Reviews of Books influence of the Gas Boom of i888 which in its earlier stages pro moted a hectic prosperity and in its later stages a deep depression alike of religious and of all other enterprise There are interesting and in structive passages dealing with the attitude of the church towards amusements and church music It seems inconceivable to us in this day that an otherwise progressive and cultivated church should object to the use of the organ in public worship but in the earlier day even so eminent an apostle as Peter Cartwright bitterly opposed what he termed hightoned music As late as I870 when the annual confer ence was in session at Kokomo the antiorgan agitators filled the organ with pepper which set the choir and congregation to sneezing and coughing as soon as the organ was started Not the least useful func tion of this interesting and comprehensive study is the light it sheds upon the manners customs prejudices and enthusiasms of our imme diate forebears CHARLES M STUART Reiniiscences By William Fletcher King New York and Cin cilinati the Abingdon Press 19I5 PP 7I6 250 This bulky volume of reminiscences is by the president emeritus of Cornell College Mount Vernon Iowa He became a teacher in this college in I862 and con tinued in active service until I908 serving from i865 as its president His career as a college president thus covered a period of fortythree years one of the longest on record At the ripe age of eightytwo he set about writing his reminiscences urged by his friends to the task The book follows the simple chronological order starting with An cestors and Childhood and ending with a Cruise around the World There are thirtyfour chapters in all Naturally the casual reader would hardly be interested in a number of the more personal chapters but to the graduate of Cornell College or to an acquaintance of the author it would prove a fascinating book There are however several chapters which deserve to be classed as historical material The author was born in a frontier community in Ohio and his description of the neighborhood in which he spent his boyhood and youth are both interesting and instructive Most of the original settlers were still living during his boyhood and he had thus the opportunity of hearing at first hand the tales of the hardships and adventures attending the settlement of a frontier community He gives considerable space to the country school which he attended and to the textbooks used as well as to a description of the country church and the part it played in the social life of the community The author spent the year I853I854 in the South teaching in ani academy in Tennessee where he had an opportunity of observing the operation of the institution of slavery Among his experiences while in the South was attendance upon a slave auction Another opportunity of considerable interest which came to him was that of accompanyingMinor Notices 445 Shermans army in its march from Savannah northward through the Carolinas The occasion of this visit to Shermans army was to collect money from the Iowa troops toward a fund that was being provided by Cornell College to assist in the education of returned soldiers and their children This scheme was approved by the officials of the state of Iowa anid the appeal met a hearty response from the Iowa troops who sulscribed nearly thirty thousand dollars toward the fund Among the other varied experiences of the author of this volume is the getting together of a fortune of some two hundred thousand dollars largely through fortunate realestate investments which he has in recent years turned over to the last penny to the college to which he has de voted his long life W W SWEET El Genteral Sutcre Por Carlos Pereyra Biblioteca de la juventud HispanoAmericana Madrid Sociedad General Espafiola de Libreria I9I7 PP 303 350 pesetas The text of this volume the fourth in a series by the same author is designed to tell the story of the life and times of Antonio Jose de Sucre to the youth of Hispanic America The nar rative is not so much an actual biography of that patriot as a collection of episodical sketches in which he appears less frequently than might be expected In its preparation the author has used for the most part the standard lives of Sucre and some of the contemporary memoirs Had he availed himself of the correspondence gathered by OLeary and centred attention upon the man himself instead of upon his historical environment a more intimate personal picture of Bolivars great lieu tenant would have been the outcome Two of the appendixes also are rather irrelevant

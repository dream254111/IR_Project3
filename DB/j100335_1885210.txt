j100335,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,1885210,Some Recent Books on Protective Tariffs,i332411,REVIEWS SOME RECENT BOOKS ON PROTECTIVE TARIFFS The work by Professor L FontanaRusso of the Insti tute of Commercial and Colonial Studies at Rome first appeared in Italian in 1906 The French translation is fluent and shows little trace of Italian idioms The typo graphical work however is unsatisfactory Many letters and syllables are missing and there are not a few misspelled words Book I is devoted to the theory of international com merce including 1 the origin and nature of international commerce 2 the doctrine of comparative costs 3 the balance of debits and credits 4 the part played by money in foreign commerce especially where there is a premium on gold In general this book is based on Bastable and the classical school tho in reference to the effects of a pre mium on gold the author at times follows Loria as against Marshall As a whole it gives a clear and useful exposition of accepted doctrines Book II discussing the different kinds of economic and commercial policies contains the meat of the work Here are most of the chapters to which the author calls special attention in the preface notably those on the forces which determine commercial policies and the relation of these policies to the density of population the distribution of wealth and to colonization These chapters contain con siderable useful matter especially a detailed demonstration if anyone anywhere still stands in need of such a demon 1 Trait6 de politique commercial par L FontanaRusso Traduit de 16dition italienne remaniee par Felix Poli vii 707 pp Paris 1908 637538 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS stration of how the interests of economic classes continu ally dominate politics On the whole however the result is undeniably disappointing The fundamental defect is that the work is not logically sound different chapters and even parts of the same chapter are utterly irreconcilable unless by an appeal to the identity of being and notbeing For example after giving what is essentially the Ricard ian theory of international commerce which as the author himself says leads inevitably to the policy of free trade he forgets all about this theory when he comes to discuss commercial policies and develops into an enthusiastic pro tectionist even going to the extreme of advocating double protection  agricultural and industrial  at the same time This occurs moreover without the least attempt to reconcile protection with the theory of international commerce so that the reader begins to doubt whether the author has really understood the theory he has just ex pounded He does indeed see clearly the evil effects of protection and especially of agricultural protection on the distribution of wealth tho he thinks these effects may be neutralized by differential taxation and the activity of labor organizations On the other hand he returns again and again to the statement that protection does actually increase production Thus he contends that protection causes capital to withdraw from less productive and em bark in more productive enterprises that it also stimu lates the growth of capital and attracts capital from abroad that it moreover increases the exports of domestic goods and finally that the burden it imposes is less than the loss which would otherwise occur through unemployment The only argument introduced in support of these propositions which are apparently regarded as selfevident is an appeal to the prosperity of Germany and the United States on the principle of post hoc ergo propter hoc In contrast to these alleged beneficent effects of protec tion it is argued that free trade would indeed give lower prices but to no purpose since the people would lack the means with which to buy that the depopulation of IrelandREVIEWS 539 was due to the repeal of the Corn Laws and that in Italy an agricultural country none of the principal crops is cap able of prospering without protection It would logically follow that a nation without protection may be unable to compete in anything and have no option but to sit down and starve All of which suggests a chamber of commerce petition or a  standpatter  speech in the Congressional Record If a surmise may be ventured as to the root fallacy underlying these crude empiricisms it is the tacit assumption 1 that the labor and capital employed in a protected industry would not be employed at all without protection or 2 that they would be less productively employed because the owner of a protected plant is able to make a larger profit than in an unprotected industry which of course involves a confusion between individual profit and social production Moreover in discussing the relation of protection to distribution a course of economic development is assumed which is contrary both to history and reason Thus it is asserted that the rate of interest is low in new countries and rises as capital comes more into use Again it is argued that land requires more fixed capital than do manufactures yet in absolute contradiction with this view that as a country gets older and more of the circulating capital wages fund is transformed into fixed capital the necessary result is a fall in wages Moreover it is maintained that the law of decreasing returns whenever it applies generally is opposed to economic rent Further it is held that the  productive classes  profit more than they lose from the rise in prices due to protection because they are more largely debtors than creditors Finally it is repeatedly declared that the extension of protection in recent decades has been due in great part to the need of more revenue whereas as the author elsewhere recognizes a protective duty in so far as it is protective of course cannot yield any revenue whatsoever Book III is devoted to the Technique of Commercial Policies covering topics such as the classification of tariffs540 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS commercial treaties and commercial statistics In general it is usable but not highly important tho the author calls special attention to the chapters on the  measure and duration of tariff duties and the  shifting and incidence of tariff duties the one because he regards it as treating a subject hitherto neglected the factors entering into com parative costs the other because of  the many grievous errors  which have been made in the field of taxation Incidentally it may be noted that altho the author refers in the preface to  les remarquables ouvrages  of Eliferich Grunzell Shippel and Van der Borght there is no reference to them in the body of the work and but little evidence of familiarity with them In fact very few German works are cited at all except in French translations and the German words quoted are often quoted incorrectly Professor Pigous Protective and Preferential Import Duties is a small book of decided interest and value It is indeed easily the most important product of the fiscal controversy in England so far as concerns the discussion of fundamental doctrines The book embodies portions of the Riddle of the Tariff by the same author published in 1903 together with the substance of several articles which appeared in the Edin burgh Review and the Fortnightly Review in 1904 and 1906 This material has been worked over into a compact and logical whole The argument refers to present conditions in England and the work is controversial to the extent of opposing Mr Chamberlains proposals In point of method however it is rigorously scientific and some use is made by way of illustration of mathematical processes The author indeed carries his impartiality to an extreme so to speak making some concessions to the protectionist argu ment which are logically unnecessary The effect of this impartiality of course is to increase the weight of the adverse verdict that is eventually reached 1 Protective and Preferential Import Duties by A C Pigou xiv 117 pp London 1906REVIEWS 541 Part I containing two chapters discusses protective tariffs in relation to 1 the national dividend 2 the na tional welfare while Part II also containing two chapters considers preferential tariffs under corresponding heads Despite the authors insistence that  the part which eco nomic conclusions should play in determining questions of practical politics is often exceedingly small it is clear that the chief value of this book lies in its searching analysis of the incidence and economic effects of protective tariffs The substance of the argument is found in the first chapter tho Part II Chapter I on the economics of colonial prefer ence also contains some acute reasoning To begin with the author concedes that  the absolute a prior method of advocating free trade that does duty in much popular discussion breaks down before serious analysis  and then proceeds to deal with the principal arguments advanced in England against the general free trade theory In answer to the contention of Professor Ashley that protection will attract foreign capital it is shown that protection must inevitably repel at least as much as it attracts and in answer to the familiar infant industries argument it is pointed out that however valid as applied to an agricultural country it can have no point in an old industrial country such as England In reply to the argument that protection will increase the scale of home production it is shown that this may mean 1 an increase in the total output of the country 2 an increase in the average size of plants 3 a lessening of shorttime 4 a vertical consolidation of industry through control of suc cessive processes 5 a horizontal consolidation through control of plants carrying on the same process as in the ordinary trust It is further shown that only the horizontal consolidation which witholds from the public the benefit of economies in production is effectively promoted by a protective tariff Again in reply to the assertion that protection will prevent destructive  dumping it is pointed out 1 that undercutting arises in the ordinary course of business among domestic as well as foreign concerns542 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 2 that a freetrade country with a lower scale of prices can more easily dump into a protected country than vice versa 3 that deliberate dumping by a protected into a freetrade country would be useless because the advantages of monopoly prices could not be enjoyed even tho all domes tic concerns should be put out of business Finally in answer to the claim that the foreigner can be made to pay part of the tax it is shown that this condition must at best be temporary because the production of the taxed article will be checked tho this check may eventually be spread in the form of a slightly lessened real return to all indus tries in the country producing the taxed article Especially penetrating is the discussion of the incidence and the revenue results of differential taxation viz a high duty on commodities from several sources a when both sources are foreign b when one is foreign and one domestic The work by Mr Robertson 1 is an elaboration of a sketch published in 1904 Like the book by Mr Pigou it deals chiefly with the fiscal question in England but in point of method and tone it offers a marked contrast It is a slash ing polemic written by a man whose viewpoint is essentially that of the philosophical radicals to whom the doctrine of relativity in economic matters is anathema and who will consequently concede nothing to his opponents Each line of argument is pursued and driven home until the pro tectionists are denounced by implication and sometimes in express terms as lacking in intelligence or intellectual integrity that is as least of all concerned to reach scientific views or to state critically the truth Of the  fighting books  generated by the attempt to restore a protective tariff in England this is certainly one of the best It adds nothing to the theory of free trade indeed it does not attempt to deal with modernrefinements of the theory represented by men like Bastable and Pigou Even Mill and Fawcett and of course Sidgwick in Mr  Trade and Tariffs by John M Robertson M P ix 331 pp London 1908REVIEWS 543 Robertsons opinion concede too much to the adversary But the author is a very keen dialectician who with rigor ous logic exposes to contempt and scorn the innumerable selfcontradictions of the protectionist movement in Eng land Part I on the  Present Protectionist Movement prac tically summarizes the main points of the book Part II traces English restrictive legislation as to trade and navi gation from medieval times down to the repeal of the Corn Laws showing how it uniformly failed to accomplish the objects sought how poverty and unemployment increased apace and how free trade was finally forced by the peril of impending famine Part III traces the effects of free trade in Holland in Britain and in New South Wales prior to confederation Part IV examines the  Modern Failure of Protectionism  in France AustriaHungary Russia Switzerland Sweden and Norway Spain and Portugal and especially the data as to unemployment emigration wages and cost of living in Germany and the United States Part V on  The Protectionist Case discusses the theory of international trade taking up in turn the arguments relating to the balance of trade retaliation dumping un employment revenue colonial preference the effects of protection on food prices the parasitic character of pro tected industries and  the final futility of protection Part VI finally discusses the ethics of protection while an appendix is devoted to  Protectionist Fables A special merit of the work is the detailed proof offered of the shifting and mutually contradictory purposes of the protection movement in Great Britain Thus Mr Cham berlains original argument in 1903 was based on the slow expansion of the export trade in manufactures Now that a great expansion has occurred in this trade he shifts to unemployment as the chief ground of complaint yet he had previously claimed that an expansion of the export trade in manufactures would cure unemployment Again his original plan contemplated merely a preferential duty on wheat now he calls for a duty on both food and manu544 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS factures but promises to offset the duties on food by lower ing the duties on tobacco and tea He claims however that the duty on wheat will not mean dearer bread Where then is the advantage to the British farmer whom he is so anxious to protect  Or to the colonial farmer  Or why do the duties on foods need to be offset as he proposes  Or why finally does he not also impose duties on raw mate rials if such duties will not raise the price  Further the purpose is declared to be chiefly to cure unemployment by keeping out foreign manufactures but it is also intended to raise additional revenue for imperial or social purposes If foreign goods are kept out how is additional revenue to be raised  Moreover if foreign manufactures are ex cluded the labor now employed in making the articles exported in exchange for such manufactures must be diverted to make these same manufactures at home which conse quently means smaller exports and higher prices If it is desired to export more manufactures protection is thus precisely the best way not to accomplish the purpose By way of criticism it may be noted that the argument usually assumes that the whole of the tariff is added to the price in practically every case This sweeping assumption is in striking contrast with Pigous guarded utterances Again it is contended that the adoption of protection was due alike in France Germany and the United States to the need of more revenue yet elsewhere it is shown that a protective tariff just in so far as it is protective does not and cannot yield revenue Further it is denied that the change in the British Patent Law of 1907 which recognizes foreign patents only in case the goods are manufactured in Great Britain is in effect protection This denial is based on a mere quibble to the effect that a patent is itself protection hence the refusal of a patent right except on certain conditions cannot be protection Obviously pro tection is here used in two senses one referring to an indi vidual the other to a nation Inasmuch as many foreign firms have been induced to set up factories in England not by the natural advantages it offers but by the necessityREVIEWS 545 of protecting their patent rights the amended patent law clearly acts as an indirect form of protection in the national sense Minor blemishes are occasional errors of fact  notably the reference to Hamburg as still a free port  and certain eccentricities of diction such as  pococurantist  deleted  worsens  worsening  worsened  minute general tariff  low general tariff  foresters  lumbermen and followed upon with which is quite unintelligible These peculiarities are however much less prominent than in the same authors Introduction to English Politics pub lished in 1900 The author of Sixty Years of Protection in Canada was formerly an English journalist but for many years has lived in this country He is the author of several works on topics relating to England and of two previously on Canada  one on Canadian journalism another on the iron and steel bounties in Canada He also traveled for several months with the Canadian Tariff Commission in 19056 and gathered material which is used to good effect in the book under review The present work deals with men and measures rather than with doctrines and is consequently historical and political rather than economic in its bearings It is essen tially the work of a journalist this fact suggests at once its merits and its limitations It is however journalism of the best type The author is a clearheaded man of sense and of ideals who does not mince words in dealing with politi cal infidelity he has carefully sifted a vast mass of material relating to commercial policies in Canada and he presents a most impressive array of facts tending to show the moral and political havoc wrought by protection Incidentally it may be added that he has a keen sense for the vivid and picturesque in language which contributes not a little to the pleasure of reading the book 1 Sixty Years of Protection in Canada 18461907 where Industry Leans on the Politician by Edmund Porritt x 478 pp London 1908546 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS A long introductory chapter entitled  The Grip of the Protected Interests on the Government and the Press  in a measure summarizes the work This is followed by a brief account Chap 2 of the repeal of the Corn Laws in England in 1846 and the consequent grant of fiscal free dom to Canada Out of this revolutionary change came four distinct movements in Canada and the remainder of the book is devoted to tracing their development and influence The free trade movement inaugurated by the Free Trade League was kept alive by the Liberals until the  Great Betrayal  of 1897 The movement for annexation to the United States commanded some support for several years culminating in the annexation manifestoes of 1849 It was never however of a serious character being partly a counsel of despair and partly intended to frighten England into restoring a preference for Canadian products The movement for reciprocity with the United States was far more substantial leading to the ElginMarcy treaty in effect 18541866 and to several later attempts on the part of Canada to renew reciprocal relations with the United States The chapters on reciprocity IVVI are a distinct contribution to the literature of the subject giving a keen analysis of the causes leading to the treaty of the distribu tion of benefits of reciprocity and of the reasons for its abrogation by the United States Finally the bulk of the book Chaps VIIXIV is devoted to the history of the National Policy in Canada especially the protective tariffs of the United Provinces of Ontario and Quebec in 185859 which were largely responsible for the abrogation of recip rocity the retaliatory Dominion tariffs of 187074 the protective policy of the conservative governments from 1878 to 1896 and the great extension of the protective system by the liberals from 1897 to 1907 not only through higher duties but also through various supplementary measures The most important of these are 1 lavish bounties 2 the law requiring Canadian rails and rolling stock to be used on all roads receiving government subREVIEWS 547 sidies 1900 3 the amended patent law of 1903 which it is alleged has forced 130 American concerns to open branch factories in Canada 4 the AntiDumping Act of 1904 and 5 the revision of postal rates in 1907 designed to exclude or at least to limit the circulation of advertising matter from the United States When to all this are added bounties from the provincial treasuries and many forms of aid by municipalities free sites bonuses free loans tax exemptions fixed taxes for a long term of years the author would appear to be well within the truth in maintaining that  protection to home industries is today more firmly intrenched in Canada than in any other country in the AngloSaxon world Incidentally a lurid light is cast on the  Red Parlour the Canadian counterpart of the  fatfrying  process familiar in the United States on the extortions practiced on the public by the multitude of combinations in restraint of trade which promptly grew up behind the tariff wall on the control of newspapers by captains of protected in dustries which has left the general public practically with out organs of publicity and on the betrayal of their own political principles by the Liberals when they came into power which has left the farmers and the laboring classes  everyone in fact except the two thousand members of the Canadian Manufacturers Association  entirely with out representation in Parliament and helpless in the face of the organized special interests that prey upon society It is also made clear how unutterably absurd from the Canadian standpoint is the Chamberlain plan of inter lacing a protective system in England with a protective system in the colonies In brief the book is valuable for its clear and concrete presentation of the facts as to reciprocity and protection in Canada and parts of the discussion especially those pertaining to the effect of protection in raising prices fo menting combinations creating a privileged class whose interests differ from the interests of the public and debauch ing political life are equally applicable to other countries548 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Two omissions may be noted There is no adequate explanation why if the farmers understand the futility of a tariff on imports to raise the prices of their exports as they do not in the United States but are said to do in Canada they have not established a party to represent their interests Again no attempt is made to trace the effects of the preference established for British goods in 1897 and still maintained with some modifications in details It is a familiar argument in the United States that the protective tariff is unconstitutional the author of The Passing of the Tariff I holds that it is unChristian and irreligious  a relic of barbarism along with slavery and polygamy and as such destined to be speedily destroyed Indeed he adds the high tariff men    have barely prevailed to postpone tariff reform till after the presidential election of 1908 This was obviously written before revision downward  had been officially interpreted by the PayneAldrich bill In a more definite way it is predicted that the protective tariff will be abolished 1 because  the international conferences at The Hague mean the political unity of man kind  2 because protection is believed to foster trusts 3 because people resent the sale of goods cheaper in foreign countries than at home 4 because some manufacturers believe the tariff hinders the winning of foreign markets 5 because protective tariffs lead to retaliation and 6 because incomes and inheritances are about to be taxed consequently the tariff can be lowered as less revenue will be needed from imports The author evidently has no suspicion that a reduction of the tariff might increase the revenue from it It is unfortunate that the author did not develop his dictum that  The commercial world will work out its sal vation on commercial lines    The Free Trade League is about to find itself distanced in the race by the men who 1 The Passing of the Tariff by Raymond L Bridgman 272 pp Boston 1909REVIEWS 549 have been the supporters of the Home Market Club As matters stand the book does indeed treat a number of new points and a number of important points but what is new is not important and what is important is not new There is however a bare possibility that it may convince some sentimentallyminded general reader who has been voting for high tariffs of the error of his ways especially as the authors declaration that  the mistaken doctrine protec tion is fast approaching to the limit of its earthly existence suggests tremendous possibilities elsewhere Evidently Dante missed a great opportunity EDWARD VAN DYKE ROBiNSON UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA

upward still with motionless wings to a height of some feet but never to the height from which he descended I have seen an eagle at the end of a halfmile sail glide upward ten or fifteen feet to his objective point and I think this is about the limit he can attain without beating his wings Now with the aerodrome of Professor Langleys dream it with an initial impulse it could be maintained on a horizontal forward course by adjustments of its inclina tions to the internal working of the column of air over which it is passing its force of gravity would be immedi ately neutralized and its onward flight consequently arrested A plane body many times heavier than air can not be sustained in direct horizontal flight through the air except by an expenditure of internal energy sufficient to propel it with a speed proportionate to the require ments of its specific gravity qualified by its surface area Professor Langley will not have fariled to observe or the mention of the fact will recall it to his recollection that sailingbirds pursuing an onward course do not main tain a horizontal line by availing themselves of any inter nal motion in the air but simply by their own unaided physical energies Recurring now to the less clearly apprehended problem of circling I believe that Professor Langleys argument that the bird could not circle with motionless wings in a horizontal current requires one important qualification he should have added  at least not if he carries his own wings level with the horizon This the circling bird never does He could no more circle while he did so than a bicyclist could circle on an upright wheel But by holding his wings obliquely to the horizontal circle of his flight he can utilize the wind as a lifting power for about fiveeighths of his courseand for propulsion also over nearly the same length provided the wind blows faster than he flies This is precisely on the principle on which a perforated card or messenger screws its course up the string of a kite The wind blows horizontally but strikes the messenger obliquely If the bird describes an oval facing the wind only on the short course he may utilize the wind for driving over threefourths of the course or even more There is hence at every sweep an accumulation of impulse to urge it over the difficulty of sailing against the wind At that stage the bird can most easily adjust his wings so as to make the opposing air lift him  the effort is required only to force himself into the wifids eye By gliding slightly downward over the onehalf or more of the course with the wind he acquires an impulse from the joint action of wind and gravity almost or quite sufficient to drive him over the remainder of the course and to raise him to his original level while facing the wind If the impulse is not strong enough the effect will be seen not necessarily in the bird falling to a lower level but in his circling further and further to leeward at every sweep In fact the aero drome of the future although like the bird it may not sail a straight horizontal course without an expenditure of energy may nevertheless like the bird be maintained in circling flight in a moderate breeze indefinitely with a minimal expenditure of energy not in consequence of the  internal work of the air but in spite of it But while this explanation of the mechanics of circling flight renders it conceivable that given the initial impulse it can be ac complished in a moderate breeze without any expenditure of energy beyond what is required for constant readjust ment of the inclination of the plane I am by no means certain that in the case of the bird the tail is not an im portant adjunct in propulsion This obliquity of the direc tion of the wings to the horizon of flight is the clue to the whole mystery of circling or soaring flight 47 The clue being given the following propositions will I think serve to completely unravel it First A bird gliding down an inclined plane owes his forward flight to the force of gravity Second To maintain himself in horizontal flight whether in a direct line or in a circle power is necessary first to overcome the force of gravity second to propel him on his course Third The bird flying in a direct line provides both lifting and driving power by beating his wings as the boat man uses his oars  the circling bird achieves the same ends by trimming his wings to the wind as the sailor trims his sails Professor Langley suggested the solution when he argued that the power must come from the air LETTERS TO THE EDITOR e Correspondents are Ir

qteries consonant with the character of the journal A Curiosity in the Vegetable World NEAR a country roadside in Tate County Miss is a curiosity which is of interest to every passerby but is especially interesting to a student of nature All of us doubtless have observed  twin  or double  trees which have a common stock for some distance above ground and which might be accounted for by the cessation of growth of the terminal bud of the trunk and by the upward development of two branches from lateral buds But the phenomenon I speak of is this two large elm trees Umus Americana about I2 and 2 feet in diameter respectively have crossed each other and have grown together in this wise The trees are about 8 feet apart at ihe base and one crosses the other about 6 feet from the ground the trees and the ground between forming a rightangled triangle  rather an obtuseangled triangle  for the tree which is most nearly erect is inclined slightly in the direction in which the other lies It seems that when young or at least some years ago one of the trees was blown up against the other the two uniting where they crossed as solidly as if one were a branch of the other the one growing almost upright while the other continued its growth in a nearly horizontal direction The latter is I should say about 50 feet long and the upper end of its trunk about 15 feet from the ground T 0 MABRY University of Mississippi Jan 23 I894  Red Ants A SHORT time since I read an article in Science con cerning red ants I wish somebody could tell me how to rid a building of them Upon our grounds are two buildings hardly fifty rods apart the  South Hall being infested from garret to cellar and the  North Hall  being absolutely free from them I can find no great difference of soil or position to account for this Why the one building should be so infested with them and the other not is more than I can explain I have tried almost every known remedy against them without success For weeks even months our rooms will be appa rently clean and free from these pests Let me bring a piece of meat on a plate into the room set it any where I choose and within twentyfour hours there will be hundredsif it remain over night thousands literally of them covering it and the neighboring ob January 26 I89448 SCIENCE jects I have held plates over the lamp or stove and burned them by the thousands yet in twentyfour hours as many more would appear Where do they come from Leave them alone and they will eat the refuse and disappear as mysteriously as they came A dead bird animal or glass in which there has been sugar a piece of cake or bread evenit is just the same I have made some interesting observations in watch ing these small apparently insignificant animals They march in long slender lines and with the regularity of clock work I have dropped a small crust of moist bread in the centre of a room and of a tapestry carpet and in half a day or less found it one living red mass of these small red ants They seem to be everywhere I believe they have regular scouts always roving about seeking food An ant that has found a bit of food will turn and re trace his steps until he finds a companion they will put their heads and their antennae or both together touching each other a number of times as if really in communica tion with one another as I do not doubt they are when the first ant will return to the food and the one bearing the message will rove round until he can communicate with another ant when he will return likewise to the same food And so it goes on It seems to be necessary that each communicate with some other before he can take his course to where the food is So each communi cates with another or some others I have in this way seen a single ant turn the course of a procession of five hundred and over I have had much amusement in keeping these ants from the table of a sick person upon which were an assortment of provisions First the ants crawled up the legs of the tablethen I tied papers of naphtha line around the legs This kept them off for awhile but they soon walked fearless over the naphthaline and were up the table again Old lemon did no good vari ous kinds of sure cure did no good finally I cut four squares of sticky fly paper a foot square and put a piece under each leg The ants came up to it walked all around it tried it in various places and then backed out They would daintily step here and there upon it feeling all about with their antennae and retreat again About a dozen and no more lost their lives by ventur ing on it But let the dust collect or the paper bend or break and in less than half an hour the table was alive with them They appeared in a procession orderly and when the food was gone disappeared in a proces sion orderly They often come from the least crack in the wall or floor in the centre of a roomwhether they crawl around the room in and out of the chinks or come directly from the walls in which they live I can not tell I once had a nest of them between the leaves of a book catalogue in the interior of my writing secre tary When and how they came there I do not know I could doubtless fill a whole issue of Science with the results of my watching of these interesting scavengers for they are nothing else but space forbids I have had them all over the body of a sick person without any attempt to bite the person and only intent upon eating or carrying away crumbs of bread left there and in the immediate vicinity I have put food in various situations for them and watched them find it Some kinds of food they do not touch apparently others they are greedy for and swarm to Is it possible to clear the building of these pests  I call them pests as they are so active so abundant and will not let food placed for others and not for them alone W A STEARNS Atlanta University Atlanta Ga Vol XXIII No 573 On the Coloration of the Ruffed Grouse ONE is rather left to suppose that Mr J H Bowles believes from what he says in his article of the above title Science No 571 p i6 that the Eastern forms of Bonasa exhibit a dichromatism of plumage such as we find in the screech owls of the genus Megascops This is the more likely to be so from the fact that he nowhere has stated in his article that ornithologists recognize at least two forms of Bonasa in New England He simply explains his meaning by selecting three birds from a bag taken in this vicinity Ponkapog Mass as they show to perfection the three different phases seen in this species viz gray brown or red and intermediate Now Bonasa in the matter of plumage is not dichromatic as is Megascops but two of the forms described by Mr Bowles are either wellrecognized species or subspecies of ruffed grouse In his  Manual of North American Birds  Mr Ridg way gives us the following representatives of this genus viz  Bonasa umnbelus B u umbelloides B u togata and B u sabini Of these I compare Bonasa umbellus and Bonasa umnbellus togata with Mr Bowless specimens Mr RIDGWAY B umbellus a1 Paler with brown markings on lower parts rather indistinct except on flanks and more or less concealed on breast and belly by broad whitish tips to the feathers these brown markings usually without distinct edges bars on flanks usually clear hair brown bl B umnbellus Upper parts mostly or entirely rusty the tail usually rusty ochraceous

 The Southern form The phase found in the southern portions Its fan is of a decided rufous tint appearing in no way like that of the northern bird except for proportions and the transverse black bands These bands are always black having a decided tinge of rufous in but very few cases The tail coverts and upper parts are also of a reddish tint the ruffs being a strong brownish red tipped with dark brown and tinged with iridescent brown  The Northern form Taking the one in the gray plumage which is the type found most commonly in Maine and the other northern parts the fan of long tailfeathers is of a decided grayish cast the back upper and lower tail coverts being of the same shade The tail coverts and back vary in intensity to a greater or less extent in individuals The ruffs are black throughout with a strong tinge of iridescent green

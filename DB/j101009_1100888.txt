throughout the transaction resulting in her getting the deed of April 25 1901 and the possession of the land it purported to convey Under these circumstances notice to J Samuel Schreckhise of the rights of appellee was notice to appel lant his principal That he had full and ample notice of the rights of appellee is shown beyond all question He surveyed the 15 acres of land owned by Richard F Humphreys dividing it into lots to be conveyed by Humphreys to his children he prepared at the same time the deeds taking Humphreys acknowledgment to each he knew that the deed to appellee had been delivered to his mother Amanda Schreckhise to be by her delivered to appellee at the death of Humphreys he obtained the deed from his mother after she had refused to deliver it to others by telling her that if she did not give it up Humphreys would prosecute her he knew of the destruction of the deed after it was gotten he must have known under the circumstances that the object in destroying the deeds Humphreys had made to his children was to divest appellee and the other children of Humphreys except Mary Echard of all interest in the land and secure to the latter the proceeds from its sale It was not until he had procured the deed to appellee from the hands of his mother and it had been destroyed that the transaction initiated in February was consummated by the deed of April 25 1901 whereby appellee as he supposed was deprived of her right to the three acres of land conveyed to her by the destroyed deed Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the decree appealed from which

Burks State Reporter 1903 7279 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER regarded as liquidated damages or as a penalty must depend on the facts of the particular case regardless of the name by which the parties have called it If the contract is for the doing of a single specific act and there is no adequate means of determining from the contract or otherwise the precise damage which may result from its breach the sum agreed will generally be regarded as liquidated damages and not a penalty but when from the nature of the contract or the work to be performed it is not difficult or impossible to ascertain the damages resulting from a breach the sum stipulated will generally be regarded as a penalty 2 CONTRACTSPeriodical paymentsReservation of a per centPenalty Security Where a per cent of periodical payments under a contract to cut and deliver wood is reserved until the contract is completed the sum reserved is regarded as a penalty or security for the com pletion of the work or the payment of the damages resulting from a failure to complete it 3 PLEADINGJeofailsLack of issue The statute of jeofails does not cure a total want of issue Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Scott county

the plaintiff in error HIoge  Bailey and W S Cox for the defendants in error CARDWELL J delivered the opinion of the court The Stony Creek Lumber Co a corporation brought its action of assumpsit in the Circuit Court of Scott county against Oliver Fields J G Fields and Rufus Fields partners under the firm name of Fields  Co having for its object the securing of 500 damages for breach of a written contract to do a certain job of logging and 35590 balance on store account alleged to be due the plaintiff The defendants plead jointly the general issue of nonassumpsit filing therewith their grounds of defense and also a cross demand of setoffs alleging that the plaintiff was indebted to them in the sum of 20410 a reserve of fifty cents on the thousand for 408190 feet of logs cut and delivered by them and also 12840 damage for what their profits would have been on 256807 feet which the plaintiff prevented them from delivering Upon the issues joined 728 DecSTONY CREEK LUMBER CO V FIELDS  CO on these several pleas a trial was had resulting in a verdict and judgment for 35590 in favor of the plaintiff against Rufus Fields alone for the balance due on the store account and for 14039 in favor of Oliver and J G Fields against the plaintiff To this judgment a writ of error was awarded the plaintiff by one of the judges of this court and the first error assigned is the refusal of the trial court to allow S M Henofer the secretary and general manager of the Stony Creek Lumber Company to answer the ques tion Please state what if anything the plaintiff company was damaged on account of the defendants failing to comply with their contract now in controversy It appears that the reason for the refusal to allow the question to be answered was that the following stiuplation in the contract sued on fifty cents per M ft is to be reserved from the payments which are to be made monthly till the contract is completed con stituted liquidated damages and if there was a violation of the contract the parties themselves had fixed the damages It is well recognized in all the authorities that it is competent for parties entering on an agreement to avoid all future questions of damage which may result from a violation thereof and to agree upon a definite sum as that which shall be paid to the party who alleges and establishes the violation In such a case the damages so fixed are termed liquidated stipulated or stated damages Welch v McDonald 85 Va 500 and authorities cited But the authorities are not harmonious as to when the sum stated in a contract to be paid or forfeited by one party to the other upon a breach of the con tract is to be regarded as liquidated damages or a penalty and the decisions seem each to have been on the particular facts of the case We have no decision in this state construing a contract of the type here under consideration that is having the provision that a part of the consideration to be paid at stated times or as work progresses shall be retained by the employer as security for complete per formance or damages for any breach by the other party and in the other states the decisions as to whether such a stipulation is to be construed as liquidated damages or a penalty are not uniform In Wolf c v The Des Moines c Ry Co 64 Iowa 380 the con tract stipulated for a reservation of ten per cent of the payments to be made monthly as liquidated damages until the completion of the work when a final settlement and payment was to be made within thirty days Held that the sum so reserved constituted 1903 7299 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER liquidated damages but the opinion says The question whether a sum named in a contract as liquidated damages for a failure to perform shall be treated as liquidated damages in fact or only in the nature of a penalty is not concluded by the terms used by the parties but is to be determined by the court from a consideration of the nature of the agreement and the surrounding circumstances When from the nature of the contract the extent of the damages which would result from a breach thereof is difficult or impossible of ascertainment and the parties have deliberately named a sum as liquidated damages the courts are more disposed to hold them to a literal interpretation of their own words Here as will be observed it was considered that from the nature of the contract the extent of the damages which resulted from the breach was diffi cult or impossible of ascertainment therefore it was a proper case in which to treat the sum which the parties had deliberately named as liquidated damages In Clements v Schuyl R c Co 132 Pa 445 the same view of the law is taken but the court was of opinion that the contract was an unconscionable one and held the sum fixed by the contract as a penalty and not as stipulated or liquidated damages The contract in that case was to raise a dwelling The house and the lot upon which it was erected were worth about 3000 and the rental value was about 25 The contract provided that the owner should be paid 150 per week after the expiration of the period within which the work was to be completed The verdict and judg ment was in favor of the plaintiff for 4400 damages and in the opinion of the appellate court it is said that it was the plain duty of a court exercising equity powers to relieve against such injustice and that it was no injustice to allow the plaintiffs to recover such loss as they could show they had sustained since the damages could be easily and accurately assessed To the same effect is Welch v McDonald supra where the con tract provided that the defendant was to pay to the plaintiff 5 per day for each day after the period at which the contract was to be fulfilled and the jury had rendered a verdict in favor of the plain tiff for 190738 as damages for the breach of the contract when for the full completion of it the defendant was to receive only 750 In Streeper v Williams 48 Pa 450 the opinion by Mr Justice Agnew says Upon the whole the only general observation we can 730 Dec1903 STONY CREEK LUMBER CO V FIELDS  CO make is that in each case we must look at the language of the con tract the intention of the parties as gathered from all its pro visions the subject of the contract and its surroundings the ease and difficulty of measuring the breach in damages and the sum stipulated and from the whole gather the view which good con science and equity ought to take of the case Sedgewick in his work on Damages Vol 1 sec 412 says Whenever the stipulated sum is to be paid on breach of a contract of such a nature that the loss may be much greater or much less than the sum it will not be allowed as liquidated damages In a contract providing for payment in instalments it is often provided that a certain proportion of the contract price shall be retained at each payment and upon breach of the contract the whole sum so retained shall be forfeited It is held in some of the states and this seems the correct view that this sum bears no porportion to the actual damage since the earlier and presumably the more in jurious the breach the less the stipulated damages are and in these states the amount is therefore not allowed as liquidated dam ages In other states however the amount if not excessive is allowed In S  C R Rd Co v Callahan 56 Ga 331 the question was whether the stipulation in the contract for retaining ten per cent of the periodical cash estimates until the completion of the work should be treated as a penalty or stipulated damages and it was held to be a penalty The opinion says Such questions are among the most vexed in the law Notwithstanding the hundreds or per haps thousands of cases to be found on the subject each case must depend in a great degree on its own facts we think the facts of the present case give it a closer alliance with penalty than with stipulated damages A similar provision was contained in the contract construed in Dullaghan v Fitch 42 Wis 679 and the view taken was that the fifteen per cent reserved out of the periodical payments was in the nature of a penalty as distinguished from liquidated damages and was intended to indemnify the party retaining it against loss from a breach of the contract Where the contract is for doing a simple specific act and there are no adequate means furnished by the contract or otherwise for ascertaining the precise damage which may result from a breach of it the courts seem to have held quiteuniformlythatthesum 7319 VIRGINIA LAW REGII lSK stipulated to be paid or forfeited should be regarded as liquidated damages and not as a penalty But when from the nature of the contract or the work to be performed it is not difficult or impossible to ascertain and assess the damages resulting from a failure to perform the decisions with equal inanimity hold that the sum reserved from periodical payments until final settlement or until the work is completed is to be treated as in the nature of a penalty or as security for the completion of the work or the payment of the damages resulting from a failure to complete the work and the weight of authority is unquestionably that way when from the subject matter of the contract the nature of the stipulations and the surrounding circumstances it is made to appear what was the real intent of the parties Cushing v Drew 97 Mass 445 Clements v R Rd Co supra Condon v Kemper and note thereto 13 L R A 671 The subject matter of the contract in the case at bar is the cutting of logs from an agreed area or locality and the delivery of them to a named line of railroad for which work one of the parties the Stony Creek Lumber Company was to pay and the other Fields and Company to receive a stipulated sum per M feet for all logs cut and delivered but the sum of fifty cents per M feet is retained on the payments to be made monthly until the completion of the entire work It would seem wholly unreasonable to deduce from this contract that it was intended by the parties that the stipulation for the reserve of fifty cents per M feet of the logs deliv ered until the completion of the entire work was to be regarded as stipulated or liquidated damages and not merely as a security for the completion of the work To so construe this type of con tract would oftener than otherwise work inequality and injustice since the nearer the approach of the completion of the work its breach occurred the larger would be the amount withheld and the nearer the beginning of the work the breach occurred the less would be the amount retained as damages although presumably the breach would be more injurious in the latter case than in the former If the sum reserved until the fulfilment of the contract be treated as a penalty or as a security for its fulfilment and not as liquidated damages no injury could result to either party as in such a case the party injured by the breach would be entitled to recover of the offending party the damages he alleges and proves no more and no less We see nothing in the contract under consideration to indi 732 Dec1903 STONY CREEK LUMBER CO V FIELDS  CO cate that it would be impossible or even difficult to establish by competent proof the actual damages resulting from its breach if a breach be shown It follows that we are of opinion that the Circuit Court erred in not allowing the plaintiff to introduce its evidence as to the damages sustained by reason of the alleged breach of the contract in question on the part of the defendants The remaining assignments of error raise in different forms the question whether the defendants who had entered no plea denying the partnership alleged in the declaration could rely on the evidence introduced tending to show that the alleged partner ship had been terminated when the cause of action arose upon which the suit is brought but as the case must go back for retrial we do not deem it necessary to consider these assignments since the defendants will have an opportunity to file the plea required under the statute section 3280 of the Code if either one or more of them rely on the defense that the alleged partnership had terminated before the cause of action arose This is not a case in which the defendants can invoke the statute of jeofails as that statute does not cure a total want of issue 4 Minors Inst Part 1 942 and authorities cited Petty v The Frick Co 86 Va 501 Nor is it a case for the application of the rule that when upon a survey of the whole record the judg ment appears to be substantially right it will be affirmed not withstanding an error may have been committed in the progress of the cause c The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed and annulled the verdict of the jury set aside and the cause remanded for a new trial to be had in accordance with this opinion Reversed 733

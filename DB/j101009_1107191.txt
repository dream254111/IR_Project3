money but the court held in view of the special circumstances substantial damages covering losses directly accruing as well as gains pre vented might furnish a legitimate basis for compensation to the in jured party It was held further that expenditures fairly incurred in preparation for performance or part performance where such expenditures are not otherwise reimbursed would be proper sub jects for consideration in estimating the damages The court quotes with approval from the opinion of Mr Justice Bradley in United States v Bohan 110 U S 338 4 Sup Ct 81 28 L Ed 168 as follows It does not lie however in the mouth of the party who has vol uptarily and wrongfully put an end to the contract to say that the party injured has not been damaged at least to the amount of what he has been induced fairly and in good faith to lay out and ex pend CorporationsStock SubscriptionsFraudulent Representations In Jones v Bankers Trust Company United States District Court D New Mexico November 8 1916 239 Fed 770 it is held that re lief will be afforded against the fraudulent misrepresentations of an agent taking subscriptions to the capital stock of a corporation even though the contract of subscription contains a clause provid ing that no statement representation or agreement of warranty made by the agent should operate to cancel or annul the contract unless reduced to writing and incorporated therein Plaintiffs had subscribed for 2000 shares of the capital stock of the defendant corporation agreeing to pay therefor 23500 Five hundred dollars of the purchase price was presently paid in cash the balance being evidenced by a promissory note due one year from date In the sale defendant was represented by two men who were its duly cred ited agents After the transaction was completed a suit was broug for the purpose of procuring a decree canceling and an nulling tlhe sale on the ground of the fraud deceit and misrepre sentation of the agents The contract contained a provision reading as follows I fur ther agree that no statement representation or agreement of war ranty made to me by the person taking this contract shall in any way operate to cancel or annul this contract unless the same be re duced to writing With reference to this provision and the statements made by the agents the court says As provisions in writing such as that there relied upon by defendant to work an estoppel and close the door to an inquiry into the very truth of the matter are contrary to natural justice they are strictly construed as to their terms against the party pleading the estoppel Looking therefore first at the lan guage of the provision in this light it is seen by its very terms to be limited to statements representations and agreements of war1918  NOTES OF CASES 707 ranty alone    Now the word warranty has a wellde fined legal meaning  Browne in his work on Fraud says A warranty differs from a representation in that a warranty must always be given contemporaneously with and as a part of the con tract whereas a representation precedes and induces to the con tract And while that is their difference in nature their difference in consequence or effect is this That upon breach of warranty or false warranty the contract remains binding and damages only are recoverable for the breach whereas upon a false representation the defrauded party may elect to avoid the contract and recover the entire price paid So construed an examination of the petition will disclose the alleged fraudulent representations of defendants agents making the sale of the shares of the plaintiffs are not in any sense warranties or statements of warranty but are merely statements and represen tations of material existing facts made by the agents for the pur pose of inducing plaintiffs to purchase the shares    Again where one party to a trade has been induced to enter into it through the fraud deceit and misrepresentations of the other party in ma terial matters no binding trade results and the defrauded party does not become bound by its terms As to him the apparently completed transaction remains as though it had never existed Such party is bound neither to its provisions nor by the principles of the law applicable to valid transactions of such nature The court therefore granted the application for a rehearing in this case holding that those paragraphs of defendants answer to the amended petition relied upon to work an estoppel or in bar of the further prosecution of this suit must be and are held insufficient for such purpose and in so far as relied upon to constitute an estoppel or any bar to the further prosecution of this suit are dismissed therefrom as contrary to good conscience and fair dealing between man alnd man HospitalsLiability

administer ing the rule respondent superior they called for at least passing notice because the same tribunal had recently gone to the full length in exonerating a public charitable hospital from

negligence of its employees although the patient pays full price

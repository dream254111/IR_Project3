latter thus making ordinary or common use conclusive of the employers nonliability Titus v Bradford B  K Ry Co 136 Pa St 618 20 Atl 517 20 Am St Rep 944 Ford v Mt Tom Sulphite Pulp Co 172 Mass 554 52 N E 1065 48 L R A 96 According to some of the best considered decisions however proof of the common use of an appliance is held to be prima facie proof only of the nonliability of the employer and capable of being rebutted by the proof of the dangerous character of the appliance Prattville Cot ton Mills v McKinney 178 Ala 554 59 South 498 Winkler v Power  Mining Machinery Co 141 Wis 244 124 N W 273 Geno v Fall Moun tain Paper Co 68 Vt 568 35 Atl 475 See Wabash Ry Co v McDaniels 107 U S 454 The ground for this view is that many well regulated plants do not use due or proper diligence in regard to every appliance in the plant and for this reason proof of customary use should not raise a conclusive presumption that any particular appliance is reason ably safe On principal it would seem that the view of the principal case is sound and that proof of the common use of an appliance should be strong prima facie evidence of the employers nonliability to be re butted only by the clearest proof of its dangerous character See Going v Alabama Steel  Wire Co 141 Ala 537 37 South 784 MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONSPOLICE POWERSREGULATION OF BILLBOARDS A city ordinance provided that any person who allowed any advertise ment of liquor to be displayed on his property should be deemed guilty of suffering a nuisance to exist Held the ordinance is invalid Haskell v Howard Ill 109 N E 992 For principles involved see 2 VA L REv 72 NEGLIGENCENEGLIGENCE OF HUSBAND AS IMPUTED TO WIFEThe plain tiffs intestate was killed in a collision with defendants train while riding in a vehicle driven by her husband Held the husbands negli gence will not be imputed to the wife Chicago  E R Co v Biddinger Ill 109 N E 953 For discussion of the principles involved see 1 VA L REV 252 PAYMENTRECOVERY OF PAYMENT MADE UNDER DURESSAs a condition precedent to the obtaining of a liquor license an illegal fee was exacted from the plaintiff The loss of the license would have occasioned great depreciation in the value of the plaintiffs property Had he been en titled to the license the plaintiff could have obtained the same by legal proceedings Held there can be no recovery Baldwin v Village of Chesaning Mich 154 N W 84 See NoTES p 309 POWERSNONEXCLUSIVE POWrERILLUSORY APPOINTMENTA beneficiary under a will was given certain property which upon his death should be distributed as he might direct by his last will to his wife and heirs at law The donee of this power by will appointed a sum of 147000 to his widow and only 1000 to his heirs at law Held the appoint 322RECENT DECISIONS 323 ment is void since it is merely illusory Barret v Barret Ky 179 S W 396 The rule appeared to be at one time established in England that where a nonexclusive power was given to appoint among a class whereby no right existed to exclude any member thereof then in equity at least there must be a substantial appointment to each member or the ap pointment will be regarded as illusory and thence void Wall v Thur bane 1 Vern 414 Spencer v Spencer 5 Ves 362 Kemp v Kemp 5 Ves 849 See 2 SUGDEN POWERS 534 et seq But a substantial part only need be given to each member of the class and equality is not necessary Butcher v Butcher 1 Ves  B 79 5 Grays Cas 371 This doctrine has now been abrogated in England by the statute of 37 and 38 Vict c 37  1 See MINOR REAL PROP  1320 TIFFANY REAL PROP  288 In this country the authorities are in a very unsatisfactory state By some strong dicta the former English rule that where the donee of a nonexclusive power fails to give to each member of the class a sub stantial share the appointment is regarded as illusory and void would seem to be regarded with favor by certain courts See Clay v Small wzood 100 Ky 212 38 S W 7 Knight v Yarbrough 21 Va 27 Thrasher v Ballard 35 W Va 524 14 S E 232 See TIFFANY REAL PROP  288 17 HARV L REV 498 In those cases however in which the precise point has arisen it has been held that the doctrine of illusory appointments will not be applied Hawthorn v Ulrich 207 Ill 430 69 N E 885 Graef v De Turk 44 Pa St 527 Cowles v Brown 8 Va 477 See also Lines v Darden 5 Fla 51 81 Fronty v Fronty 1 Bailey Eq S C 509 522 And this would seem to be the ibetter rule Thus where a power of appoint ment among a class is given by will a court of equity should not con trol the appointments actually made where the donee of the power has acted in good faith even though the shares given to the various members of the class may appear to the average mind to be unequal and the discrimination unwise Portstmouth v Shackford 46 N H 423 Graef v DeTurk supra See also Lines v Darden supra The donor of the power has relied upon the discretion of the donee and for a court to prohibit the exercise of this discretion would be to disregard the exipress command of the donor See Bax v VWhitbread 16 Ves 15 Fronty v Fronty supra Of course where the exercise of the power by the donee has tbeen actuated by fraudulent motives then a court of equity should annul the appointments made thereunder since no one may profit by his own wrong Stocker v Foster 178 Mass 591 60 N E 407 Degnman v Deglman 98 Ky 717 34 S W 523 And where the exercise of the power is declared void or the power has not been exer cised the estate is distributed equally on the ground that equality is equity Wetmore rv Henry 259 Ill 80 102 N E 189 Degman v Deg Ian supra TRIALSCHANCE

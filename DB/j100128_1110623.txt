ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACT TO REGULATE COMMERCE In these latter days a court should have little difficulty in de termining its proper course when plainly called upon to choose as courts are often compelled to choose between the letter and the spirit of a statute For the primary object of construction is after all to carry out the legislative will and this is not to be accom plished without subordinating the language of a statute to its policy and purpose when the two are squarely in conflict This familiar canon of interpretation is now accepted at least in theory by most if not all courts most notably perhaps by the Supreme Court of the United States Only the particular appli cations of the rule are disputed Except in our highest tribunal departures in practice are by no means rare and in matters of great public interest a fearless adherence to the principle occasion ally excites adverse criticism both lay and professional The de cisions in the Standard Oil2 and Tobacco3 cases are familiar exam ples of this Such criticism may even go the length of attacking the doctrine and demanding its abandonment4 Yet unless the courts are to abdicate one of their weightiest functionsthat of giving rational and effective voice to the obscure or conflicting ut terances of the legislaturethe rule of reason cannot be laid aside Like any other efficient instrument of government it may be abused or perverted This affords small excuse for stripping the courts of its intelligent use whenever such use is essential to supplement the written law Certain recent decisions of the Federal Supreme Court round out a process of judicial development under the Act to Regulate Commerce which strikingly illustrates this sort of creative interpre tation The Commerce Act has sorely needed the fostering aid of such interpretation to effectuate its underlying purposes It has grown by a process of gradual accretion Particularly in extend ing the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission has Con HIoly Trinity Church v United States 1892 143 U S 457 Pickett v United States I9Io 216 U S 456 461 Standard Oil Co v United States I9II 221 U S I United States v American

certain inconsis tencies on its face which have called for intelligent and at times dynamic construction to weld it into a coherent whole Yet were their field less technical or better understood than it is today by the public at large at least one of these decisions could hardly have escaped the hostile eye of the undiscriminating critic As it is they have passed into the body of law comparatively unnoticed and may here be placidly discussed on their merits The phase of this judicial evolution which the present article seeks to trace concerns those remedial provisions of the Act which declare the respective functions of the Commission and the courts To define somewhat more exactly the scope of this article it deals but incidentally with the power of the courts to review the Com missions findings or with the machinery provided for enforcing its orders Our question is one of priority of jurisdiction the circumstances under which an order or finding by the Commission is a condition precedent to any judicial action PRIVATZ REMEDIES The rules which govern in civil suits under the Act have now been worked out to a point which closely approaches completeness The doctrines of the three leading cases of this branch of the problem are familiar law By way of premise to our subsequent discussion however they may well be set down here The first of these was Texas and Pacific Railway Co v Abilene Cotton Oil Co6 There a shipper sued a carrier in a state court to recover damages for alleged unreasonable rates charged on inter state shipments of cotton seed oil The rate complained of was part of a schedule duly filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission That body had never passed on its legality The trial court how ever found as a fact that the rate was unreasonable The Su preme Court held that the action did not lie that the shipper must first invoke redress through the Interstate Commerce Commission before seeking relief in the courts The suit was based upon the common law right to recover dam ages for unreasonable charges by a common carrier and might have been disposed of on the ground that the Act abrogated that See especially  15 and I6 of the original Act 24 Stat 384 385 and cf amendments of March 2 i889 25 Stat 859 June 29 I9o6 34 Stat 589 590 and June I8 x9Io 36 Stat 55I 554 Oi9o6 204 U S 426 212ENFORCEMENT OF THE COMMERCE ACT 213 right But the court went farther than this Section 9 of the Act7 was relied on to show that Congress intended the courts to exercise independent jurisdiction in awarding damages to shippers The court without alluding to the fact that the section had no appli cation to state tribunals8 flatly refused to construe it as conferring any right to recover damages for unreasonable charges prior to a finding by the Commission Since the Act required that estab lished rates be adhered to until altered by action of the Commis sion or the filing of new rates the result of recognizing such a right it was said would be that a shipper might obtain relief upon the basis that the estab lished rate was unreasonable in the opinion of a court and jury and thus such shipper would receive a preference or discrimination not enjoyed by those against whom the schedule of rates was con tinued to be in force The counter suggestion that the judgment of the court in such a suit would ipso facto change the scheduled rate was declared to be untenable For if without previous action by the Commission power might be exerted by courts and juries generally to determine the reasonableness of an established rate it would follow that unless all courts reached an identical conclusion a uniform standard of rates in the future would be impossible as the standard would fluctuate and vary dependent upon the divergent conclusions reached as to reasonableness by the various courts called upon to consider the subject as an original question Indeed the recog nition of such a right is wholly inconsistent with the administrative power conferred upon the Commission and with the duty which the statute casts upon that body of seeing to it that the statutory requirement as to uniformity and equality of rates is observed Equally obvious is it that the existence of such a power in the courts independent of prior action by the Commission would lead to favoritism to the enforcement of one rate in one jurisdiction and a different one in another would destroy the prohibitions 7Providing that any person    claiming to be damaged by any common carrier    may either make complaint to the Commis sion    or may bring suit in his    own behalf for the recovery of the damages    in any district or circuit court of the United States of competent jurisdiction but such person    shall not have the right to pursue both of said remedies and must in each case elect which one of the two methods of procedure herein provided for he    will adopt 24 Stat 382 8Since this decision  I6 has been amended by Act of June I8 I9IO 36 Stat 551 so as to allow suit on an award of reparation by the Commission to be brought in a state court of general jurisdiction as well as a federal district court Darnell v Illinois Central R R Co I9I2 225 U S 243 This apparently has no effect however on the original suit for damages contemplated by  9COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW against preferences and discrimination and afford moreover a ready means by which through collusive proceedings the wrongs which the statute was intended to remedy could be successfully inflicted The effect of  9 was thus defined The independent right of an individual originally to maintain actions in courts to obtain pecuniary redress for violations of the act conferred by the ninth section must be confined to redress of such wrongs as can consistently with the context of the act be redressed by courts without previous action by the Commission9 This case has been quoted from at length because it is the foun dation of substantially all the later law on the subject It was followed in 1910 by Baltimore  Ohio Railroad Co v Pitcairn Coal Col0 In that case mandamus was brought by a ship per against the railroad under  23 of the Act to prevent an al leged discrimination in the distribution of coal cars pursuant to a regulation of the carrier Although by the terms of  2311 this remedy is cumulative the court held that it could not be availed of prior to a finding by the Commission that the practice was unjustly discriminatory This result was based largely upon the considerations which governed the decision in the Abilene case and in addition upon the amendment to  15 of the Act adopted in I9o612 whereby the Com mission was empowered not only to determine the legality of the practice complained of but to direct the practice to be followed in the future It was declared that to give to  23 the broad meaning which the court below affixed to it would be to destroy or render inefficacious the remedial pur poses of the amendments enacted in I906     9906 204 U S 440 442 IgIo 215 U S 481 USection Io of Act of March 2 I889 25 Stat 862 concluding Pro vided That the remedy hereby given    by writ of mandamus shall be cumulative and shall not be held to exclude or interfere with other remedies provided by this Act or the Act to which it is a supplement 34 Stat 589 In U S ex rel Stony Fork Coal Co v L  N R R Co 1912 I95 Fed 88 the Commerce Court two judges dissenting held the doctrine of the Pitcairn case inapplicable to a petition by a shipper alleging that the defendant carriers refused to move his coal at all under a through route and joint rate established by them and issued a writ of mandamus under  23 without prior action by the Commission This conclusion finds support in L  N R R Co v Cook Brewing Co I9i2 223 U S 70 8384 where it was held unnecessary under the Abilene rule for a shipper who had been refused transportation of liquor into dry territory because of the alleged prohibition of a state statute to go to the Commission before suing for a mandatory injunction to compel such service 214ENFORCEMENT OF THE COMMERCE ACT 215 In Robinson v Baltimore  Ohio Railroad Co18 the defendant railroad had charged 50 cents more per ton for the shipment of coal loaded from a wagon than from a tipple A shipper sued in the state court to recover as damages the excess paid for coal loaded from a wagon alleging that the rate was unjustly discrimi natory But as the rate was part of a filed and published schedule and the Commission had not acted in the premises it was held that the doctrine of the Abilene case applied and the action did not lie The Robinson case goes somewhat farther than its predeces sors It was urged that a prior decision by the Commission in a proceeding brought by another shipper finding the rate in ques tion to be unjustly discriminatory should have been judicially no ticed by the trial court under  1414 of the Act The Supreme Court overruled this contention holding that the Commissions de cision should have been introduced in evidence if relied on but added that The result    would have been the same had the decision been properly before the court An examination of it discloses that it did not contain any finding or direction as to what if any reparation should be made because of prior exactions of the rate which it condemned It did find that the complaining party in that proceeding had been injured by the refusal of the railroad company to furnish cars on certain occasions for the shipment of coal and did direct that reparation therefor be made but that is without bearing here This might be taken to mean that a reparation order in favor of some other shipper would have sufficed But since a shipper who seeks to recover for unlawful discrimination must prove the extent of his actual damage and cannot claim as of right the difference between the charges paid by him and the lowest rates charged to others15 a finding that some one else had suffered injury to a cer tain amount would have little if any bearing upon the measure of his damages It may therefore be safely inferred from the pas sage quoted that the shipper should have obtained an order from the Commission awarding a specific amount of reparation to himt I9I2 222 U S 506 Providing that The Commission may provide for the publication of its reports and decisions    and such authorized publications shall be competent evidence of the reports and decisions of the Commission therein contained in all courts of the United States and of the several States without any further proof or authentication thereof 34 Stat 589 Penn R R Co v Internat Coal Co x193 230 U S I84COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW before bringing his action at law16 In other words the Act does not contemplate a mixed proceeding partly judicial under  9 and in part administrative under  i6 if the shipper has to go before the Commission in the first instance the Commission must carry the case through and award reparation if any is to be recovered and cannot turn that function over to the court And this would presumably be true whatever the character of the damages claimed6 Unless one believes that the court when confronted by the dilemma of doing violence to the language of a single section or of subverting the manifest purpose of the entire Act must needs choose the latter alternative the logic of the Abilene and Robinson decisions is unanswerable If a carrier may be mulcted in dam ages for not departing from an established schedule in a given in stance it may surely compromise a claim for such damages in ad vance of action Whatever the measure of these damages the 6National Pole Co v Chicago  N W Ry Co D C Wis 1912 200 Fed 185 Franklin v Phila  R Ry Co D C Pa I913 203 Fed 134 accord as to damages for unreasonable charges In Lehigh Val ley R Co v Clark C C A 3rd C 1913 207 Fed 717 the court held that as the findings and order of the Commission in a reparation case are prima facie evidence only of the facts therein stated a finding that a former rate was unreasonable to the extent it exceeded the new rate and an order for reparation to the amount of such excess payments was not sufficient to make a prima facie case for the shipper This was on the theory that under  I6 a shipper must prove actual damage which would not amount as a matter of law to the difference between the rate paid and a reasonable rate This is true as to damages for rebates or discriminations Penn R R Co v Internat Coal Co supra note I5 It seems less applicable to actions for unreasonable rates where the shipper may well be regarded as damaged at the moment of payment to the ex tent of the unreasonable exaction Such has been the measure of damages commonly applied by the Commission Drinker The Interstate Com merce Act  314 and cases cited see Fidelity Lumber Co v Great Northern Ry Co C C A 9th C 1912 I93 Fed 924 laIn Joynes v Penn R R Co I909 17 I C C 36I the Commission held that it had no power to award damages for preferences in the use of terminal facilities but that its jurisdiction was limited to socalled rate damages as distinguished from general damages of the kind claimed which it was said could only be recovered in the courts In Hillsdale Coal  Coke Co v Penn R R Co I912 23 I C C i86 however this ruling was reversed in view of the decision in Morrisdale Coal Co v Penn R R Co C C Pa 910o I76 Fed 748 C C A 3rd C I9Io 183 Fed 929 that a suit for damages for discriminatory coal car distribution could not be brought originally in the Circuit Court and reparation for such distribution was awarded the Commission neverthe less expressing grave doubts of its authority in the premises This ex ercise of jurisdiction was sustained in Jacoby v Penn R R Co D C Pa I912 200 Fed 989 the court holding that the Act made no distinction between rate and general damages but gave the Commission original jurisdiction as to both in discrimination cases Since the affirmance of the Morrisdale decision by the Supreme Court 1913 230 U S 304 discussed infra this result seems hardly open to question 216ENFORCEMENT OF THE COMMERCE ACT 217 consequence of permitting their payment would be to allow the car rier to prefer the aggrieved shipper to all other similarly circum stanced and thus to create a discrimination and give a rebatethe very practices which the Act was particularly designed to abolish The rule of the Pitcairn case follows of necessity from that of the other two Carriers must file schedules of regulations and practices as well as of rates and a departure from the practice thus established is made an offence equally with rebatingl7 There is no more reason in one case than in the other for permitting such a departure under the sanction of judicial process Underlying these particular reasons however is the courts conviction that the Interstate Commerce Commission is in law and in fact the proper body to pass on administrative questions arising under the Acti e questions as to which the Act prescribes no definite rule of action but merely provides the tests of reasonable ness preference or discrimination under substantially simi lar circumstances and conditionsl8 These are questions of fact and undoubtedly it was in part because of the assumed unfitness of a court or jury to pass on questions of this nature that the Com mission was created That body acts in such matters as a jury and more its findings cannot be upset by the courts if they have any substantial evidence to support theml9 and it deals alike with individual complaints and general rates and practices and both awards reparation for past misconduct and prescribes a rule for the future In view of the nature and powers of the Commission the court naturally imputed to Congress the purpose of confiding to it exclusive original jurisdiction of such problems The powers of the Commission over past as well as present and continuing rates and practices asserted by Mr Justice White in the Abilene case20 is attested by two recent decisions In Mitchell Coal and Coke Co v Pennsylvania Railroad Co2 decided last June the shipper claimed damages for the payment of alleged rebates to other coal companies in the same field The pub lished tariff named the rate from station to destination but it was usually construed to include the haul from the mines within the See  6 as amended by Act of

The carrier had paid to many of these companies a socalled trackage or lateral allowance as compensa tion for hauling cars from their mines to the station Upon its refusal to make such allowance to the plaintiff this action was brought in the district court The carrier sought to justify the al lowance contending that because of dissimilar conditions it could itself haul plaintiffs cars from the mines but could not do so eco nomically for the other shippers The court regarding as proper the construction of the rate as from mine to destination held Mr Justice Pitney dissenting that whether or not the allowance was proper was an administrative question for the Commission to pass on and hence that the action did not lie It was said that since the legal quality of the practice complained of was not definitely fixed by the statute the legal ity of the allowance depended upon its reasonableness But to determine that question involves a consideration and com parison of many and various facts and calls for the exercise of the discretion of the rateregulating tribunal The courts have not been given jurisdiction to fix rates or practices in direct proceed ings nor can they do so collaterally during the progress of a law suit    22 The further feature of the case that the claim was based upon the unreasonableness of past rates and discontinued practices gave rise to the assertion that nothing was presented but a judicial question for the courts to decide This contention was decisively overruled the court pointing out that the rateregulating discre tion was equally involved in dealing with past and with present rates and that the courts had no more authority to declare un reasonable a former rate lawfully established than a present one In Morrisdale Coal Co v Pennsylvania Railroad Co23 the matter complained of as undue discrimination was a long abandoned method of coal car distribution which operated to the alleged in jury of the complaining shipper Here too the court held Mr Justice Pitney again dissenting that a prior finding by the Com mission that the practice was unreasonable was essential to the cause of action The power to investigate and award reparation for past mis conduct is thus seen to be plenary and not merely incidental to the power to deal with existing abuses and so defined it is exclusive 2Ibid p 255 I9Q3 230 U S 304 218ENFORCEMENT OF THE COMMERCE ACT 219 The court has thus definitely rejected the distinction urged by Mr Justice Pitney in his dissenting opinion24 that questions of admin istration necessarily relate solely to the present and future and not to the past The determining factor is the nature of the problem presented and not its place in point of time25 The above cases all rest on the circumstance that questions of an administrative nature were involved Where no administrative question is presented the situation is governed by the rule laid down in Pennsylvania Railroad Co v International Coal Mining Co2 decided on the same day as the two cases last cited There the carrier had collected the published tariff rate on all coal but differentiated between free coal and contract coal i e coal already sold for future delivery refunding on the latter a certain sum to the shippers The published tariffs made no distinction between contractand free coal but named one rate for both It was consequently held that a shipper who had not received such rebates and had been damaged by their payment to others could recover his damages in an action at law without prior action by the Commission in the premises Here the preference complained of was a departure from a filed and published rate and that was unlawful as a matter of law Consequently it was immaterial whether a difference in rates could have been made between free and contract coal since none was made in the only way in which it could have been lawfully done There was therefore no call for the exercise of the rateregu lating discretion of the administrative body to determine that purely academic question Cases are likely to arise where the question whether the illegal ity of the carriers conduct is matter of law or of fact will prove a Ibid p 267 In this respect the administrative function of the Commission is broader than the legislative as distinguished from the judicial function of such a

Law 14 Columbia Law Rev 1226 I9r3 230 U S I84COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW close one It is believed however that the test adopted in the International Coal Mining Co case will solve nearly all such diffi culties For example carriers frequently give a months credit or even more to regular shippers If the rules governing the ex tension of credit are set forth in the published tariffs the question of the legality of the practicei e whether it was an undue pref erence to the shippers thus favoredmight well be held to depend upon its reasonableness and thus to be in the primary cognizance of the Commission But the giving of credit not so named in the tariffs would seem to be a departure from the filed and published schedule and therefore unlawful per se as a secret rebate27 Since the carrier has failed to provide for credit in the only lawful way the reasonableness of the practice is not in issue For the printed schedule is designed to cover all the relations between shipper and carrier under the Act and anything outside its four corers is anathema and void28 Again the propriety of lateral allowances is intrinsically an administrative question29 But an allowance to a consignee for hauling his freight in wagons from station to warehouse if not granted in accordance with the printed schedule involves a de parture from the published rate which no ruling by the Commis sion could validate and is therefore a gifta rebatea thing ipso facto illegal and prohibited by the statute30 These instances suggest however a possible qualification of this test Some practices have been judicially condemned as unjustly discriminatory per se whether contained in the printed schedule or not Thus a carrier may not charge railroads less than it charges other shippers for transporting coal30 nor sell transportation for See United States v Hocking Valley Ry Co D C Oh 19II 194 Fed 234 United States v Sunday Creek Co D C Oh i9Ii I94 Fed 252 Chicago  Alton R R Co v Kirby 1912 225 U S

the legality of a discrimination in rates against forwarding agents may depend upon circumstances within the exclusive cognizance of the Commission even though the Act does not authorize such discriminationan anomalous result if true 220ENFORCEMENT OF THE COMMERCE ACT 221 advertising30b Decisions of this sort apparently proceed upon the theory that the conduct complained of is illegal as matter of law regardless of surrounding circumstances Where this is so since no ruling by the Commissioncould legalize the violation of the statute there seems to be nothing for the administrative discretion of that body to act upon In that situation it would seem useless to require the shipper to obtain an order by the Commission before bringing his action at law for damages or mandamus In every ac tion brought without such a ruling the court must first decide whether the complaint alleges facts amounting in law to a clear in fringement of the Act in order to determine its own jurisdiction and if our reasoning is sound this question cannot always depend solely on whether a departure from the schedule is involved That is too narrow a test to meet all cases A carrier should not be al lowed to convert a plain violation of law into an administrative problem simply by filing a schedule setting forth the illegal practice in terms Hence the unqualified statement that questions of discrimina tion or preference are always administrative in character is perhaps too broad The test may rather be whether or not the case pre sents any question upon which the finding of the Commission would be conclusive as a finding of fact If it does it involves matters of administration with which the Commission alone can deal but if not a court should be competent to handle the problem de novo like any other judicial question This possible limitation on the Abilene principle while largely a matter of conjecture until reduced to certainty by the Supreme Court3so cannot be wholly ignored in determining the true scope of that doctrine 3bChicago Ind  L Ry Co v United States 19II 219 U S 486 496 Although in this case the alternative mode of payment by advertising

down in the Pitcairn case 215 U S 481 499 And in L  N R R Co v Cook Brewing Co supra note I2 where notice of refusal to ship into dry territory had been filed with the Commission it was said that the

which it claimed on the ground that the Commission would then have nothing left to decide This reductio ad absurdum demonstrates the soundness of the prevailing viewthat the Act contemplated the filing of a rate and its enforcement without ju dicial interference and left to the Commission the task of determin ing its reasonableness Indeed if the Interstate Commerce Com mission has sole primary jurisdiction of an action for damages re sulting from a rate already in force a fortiori it has of a complaint concerning a future rate where even according to Justice Pitneys distinction heretofore mentioned the question presented is wholly an administrative one Especially is this so now that the Com mission under  15 may suspend a new rate pending an investi gation of its reasonableness The result of the civil cases may be thus summarized I An action for damages for unreasonable or discriminatory practices or rates or a petition for mandamus to compel the aban donment of a discriminatory or preferential rate or practice does not lie unless founded on an order by the Commission determining the question of fact in the shippers favor and awarding the par ticular reparation or decreeing the particular relief demanded 2 Such an order may not be necessary however if the dis crimination charged is illegal per se and as matter of law 3 Suit may be brought without prior action by the Commis sion to recover damages for or probably to compel the relin quishment of a rate or practice not according to the filed and pub lished schedule 4 By the better view a suit to restrain the enforcement of a proposed advance or change in rates as unreasonable is not main tainable either before or pending action by the Commission CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS Until the past year no

powers of the Commission A few decisions in the district courts have gone farther than this and sustained indictments for unjust discrimination where no finding by the Commission was alleged34 In only one of these35 however was the authority of the Abilene case relied on in defence and the grounds on which the court distinguished that case were at least questionable The question whether an indictment for unreasonable rates unlawful preferences or unjust discriminations is maintainable without a prior finding by the Commission against the carrier on these issues was therefore res nova until quite recently It was settled by the Supreme Court in United States v Pacific and Arctic Co83 decided in April last That was an indictment against the principal railway company in Alaska and three steamship companies operating between Seattle Vancouver and Skagway Alaska alleging unjust discrimination in the transportation of passengers and freight as against the Hum boldt Steamship Company a competitor of the defendant steam ship lines It was charged that the defendants had entered into an arrangement for the through billing of freight and passengers from the southern ports to points on the Yukon at a joint through rate but that the defendant railroad had refused without cause to make such an arrangement with the Humboldt Company and consequently charged that company from 5 to 300 more for carry ing freight than it received from the defendant steamship com panies under the joint through rate The district court sustained a demurrer to the indictment on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the questions United States v Miller 1912 223 U S 599 Great Northern Ry Co v United States 1908 208 U S 452 Armour Packing Co v United States I908 209 U S 56 Wight v

upon by the Commission This ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court which expressly held that the principle of the Abilene and Pitcairn cases was equally applicable to criminal and to civil proceedings It was urged by the Government in argument that the Inter state Commerce Act made no provision for the effect of a finding by the Commission in criminal cases that if such finding were ineffectual it would be vain to require it that to make it con clusive or prima facie evidence was unwarranted by the Act and perhaps in violation of the Sixth Amendment It was further pointed out that such an administrative finding must be equally effective whether against the defendant or for him and if a finding in his favor could be set up in bar to a prosecution the Interstate Commerce Commission would become practically the court of final criminal jurisdiction The courts answer to these arguments is worth quoting The contentions of the Government would be formidable in deed if the Interstate Commerce Act was entirely criminal But it is more regulatory and administrative than criminal It has it is true a criminal provision against violation of its requirements but some of its requirements may well depend upon the exercise of the administrative power of the Commission This view avoids the consequences depicted by the Government It keeps separate the civil and criminal remedies of the act each to be exercised in its proper circumstances It makes the Interstate Commerce Act what it was intended to be and defined to be in the cases cited by the District Court towit Texas  Pacific Ry Co v Abilene Cotton Oil Co and Baltimore  Ohio Railroad Co v Pitcairn Coal Co supra And it would in our judgment be an erroneous view to take that the great problems which the act was intended to solve and the great purposes it was intended to effect should be considered of less consequence than the facility which should be given to some particular remedy civil or criminal We need not extend the discussion The purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act to establish a tribunal to determine the relation of commu nities shippers and carriers and their respective rights and obli gations dependent upon the act has been demonstrated by the cited cases and also the suiffciency of its powers to deal with the cir cumstances set forth in the indictment Italics ours37 This passage particularly the italicized portion seems to sug gest at least that in cases of this class involving questions of un reasonableness and discrimination there is no offence until the Interstate Commerce Commission has made an order altering the Ibid p o17COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW rate or practice complained of and that order has been violated In other words a discriminatory or unreasonable rate or practice is not a criminal violation of the Act unless persisted in after its cessation has been decreed by the Commission Nor is there any question that the court intends the same tests of jurisdiction to apply hereafter in criminal as in civil cases In Mitchell Coal Co v Pennsylvania Railroad Co38 an action for damages plaintiff relied on an earlier criminal case39 where the Supreme Court without preliminary action by the Commission held that a certain allowance to a consignee was a rebate and pun ishable under the Statute The court however distinguished that case not as a criminal prosecution but simply because it involved a departure from the published rate which was ipso facto illegal The act complained of it was said was therefore one for which the guilty carrier was subject to criminal indictment and for which damages could have been awarded on the civil side of the court40 In other words if under a given state of facts a ruling by the Commission is an essential preliminary to a civil suit it is equally indispensable to a criminal prosecution and vice versa The body of law worked out in private suits may therefore be transferred and applied without change to the criminal side of the docket The first objection to this result is that it seems to ignore the plain provisions declaring all such rates and practices unlawful and in violation of the Act41 and making all violations of the Act punishable offenses42 The court apparently was not blind to this seeming obstacle But again it found itself confronted by the dilemma presented in the Abilene Pitcairn and Robinson cases that of adhering to the strict language of a particular provision or of interpreting that provision in the light of the Act as a whole In view of its previous course in that situation its choice of the latter alternative is not surprising It cannot be denied however that the decision in effect wipes out the criminal efficacy of the provisions43 requiring reasonable Supra Wight v United States

the Commission that body if it finds the complaint justified will order a new rate or regulation filed And when filed it is to be observed a de parture from its terms is per se a violation of the Act regardless of the causes which led to its adoption44 True the carrier might openly refuse to file the new rate or obey the order and it may be argued that even under the Pacific and Arctic decision such refusal would necessarily be unreasonable or discriminatory44 But in view of the distinct penalties now imposed for any violation of an order by the Commission45 the argument seems open to doubt and as a practical matter the question is unlikely to arise since carriers today find it more profitable not to incur those penalties but to obey the Commissions orders and contest them if at all by equity proceedings in the courts It follows that while a carrier after the Commission has found its rate or practice discriminatory or unreasonable may be held to account civilly for damages accruing to a shipper prior to such finding it probably cannot be punished criminally for such ante cedent misconduct While anomalous on its face the result is not an undesirable one If the average jury is incompetent to decide the complex questions of reasonableness and discrimination in an action for damages it can hardly be asked to do so in a criminal prosecution Where experts honestly differ twelve laymen would seldom be found to agree with a like number in another jurisdic tion and the consequence would be intolerable confusion as well as frequent injustice to defendant carriers whose views on a nice question of railroad administration happened to conflict with those of a particular jury Indeed it might well happen that the Com mission would sometimes be actually if not legally particeps crimninis If the ruling of that body agaitst the carrier were not a necessary prerequisite to an indictment it is hard to see why its finding for the carrier should be a bar to prosecution We might thus have juries condemning criminally an act which the Com mission had expressly sanctioned It may be suggested that these consequences could have been avoided and the full effect of the Act preserved by holding that the carrier might be indicted after an adverse finding by the Com Section 6 as amended note 17 supra  I of Elkins Act note 42 supra 44See La  P Ry Co v United States 19I3 209

heavier penalties therein prescribed for violating such an order Section I6 as amended in 90o6 34 Stat 590  6 as amended in I9IO 36 Stat 548COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW mission for its previous misconduct There are several objections to this Some of them were suggested in the Governments brief above referred to that the Act says nothing about the effect of such a finding in a criminal trial and consequently the court could not give effect to it without legislating that to hold it ineffective would render its requirement a vain thing But beyond all this there is at least an apparent injustice in holding any person indi vidual or corporate answerable criminally for conduct concerning whose legality honest men both can and do differ The certainty requisite to a criminal statute appears to be wanting here46 The carrier it is true must act at its peril so far as its civil liability is concerned Every new rate or practice may prove a ground for redress to some shipper for be it observed that as long as the Act permits discriminations where conditions warrant them so long will the shippers discriminated against complain of their injustice This however imposes no undue hardship on the carrier it is its business to guess right in these matters The reparation awarded is merely compensatory and is likely to be the difference between the rate the carrier charged and the rate it should have charged4 Besides the allowance of any compensation is within the discre tion of the Commission and there is no review of that bodys re fusal to grant it48 To require the carrier to act at its peril of a criminal prosecution where it must act is quite another matter To persons who object on principle to government by commis sion the decision in the Pacific and Arctic case will seem a dan gerous step for it is plainly in the direction of enlarging the powers of our most powerful administrative body On the other hand those who have no inflexible theories which predetermine their thought and judgment on new problems of government but who prefer to test empirically the wisdom of new solutions are likely to welcome it as an intelligent extension of that bodys control over the railroads

SProcter  Gamble Co v United States I9II 225 U S 282 The question whether this result deprives the shipper of his right to a jury trial contrary to the Seventh Amendment seems never to have been

language was anciently spoken by a tribe of the same name living at the close of the seventeenth century on the lower course of Yazoo river about twenty miles from its mouth The word is from a native root uni or oni meaning person the equivalent of Lat in hoimo but they called their tribe Yoron a word of uncertain origin From a statement by the French officer Diron dArtaguette we know that another tribe known as Tiou living associated with the Natchez spoke the same language and shared the same customs and there is strong circumstantial evidence that two other tribes on the lower Yazoo the Ya zoo and Koroa spoke dialects which were at least closely related According to Le Page du Pratz a fourth tribe the Grigra which also lived with the Natchez shared with those enum erated the phonetic peculiarity of r and hence we may assume they were also of this group Most of the evidence on which this relationship has been established has been given by the writer in Bulletin 43 of the Bureau of Amer ican Ethnology to which the reader is referred as also for an account of the history of each of the tribes mentioned 2 The Tunica are the only tribe of the Tuni i Published by permission of the

reservation just south of the town of Marksville La The great body of Tunica material upon which the present sketch is based was collected by the late Dr A S Gatschet between October and December I886 at Lecompte La from an Indian of the Marksville band named William Ely Johnson I 1907 19o8 and rgIo the writer paid visits to the band and went over Dr Gatschets material Perhaps owing to the fact that he was able to communicate with these Indians in French this work by Dr Gatschet seems to have been exceptionally well done and the writer was able to add little to it except in the way of verification He also collected a few texts but with hardly as much success as Dr Gatschet since there are no Tunica men of sufficient intelligence to make good inter preters and the language itself is fast falling into disuse Probably not more than half a dozen use it with anything approaching fluen cy The writer feels that particularcredit is due to Dr Gatschet for the manner in which he recorded and elucidated the structure of this particular language in many respects one of the most peculiar spoken in the Gulf area He made it the subject of papers before scientific bodies from time to time but these contain nothing but the barest outlines  VOLUME 2 NUMmRS I AND 2 I2 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL 2 PHONETICS The signs employed to represent Tunica sounds must be considered merely as approx imations to the original phonetics While more careful recording mightintroduce some improve ment it is probable that many of the ancient peculiarities have been lost in the breaking down of the language The signs have been made to conform as nearly as possible to those recommended in the Report of the Committee of the American Anthropological Association on the  Phonetic Transcription of Indian Languages  as  the simpler system the second alternative being adopted in the repre sentation of vowels The following are the vowel signs actually employed a as in FATHER d as

where we find a consonant followed by a vowel which is in turn followed by a spirant as haxka CORN haxsa TO SAW hexpu TO CLIMB kaxci REAL  nuxti TO ROCK SuxsU MUSCADINE yaxpa HUNGRY In some of these

In many of these cases we have good reason to suspect that a weak final vowel has been omitted While syllables are typically of the conson antvowel type stems are more often disyllabic usually of

will be used approximately as often in verbs as in nouns in the same situa tion The accompanying tables shows the results of this examination It is to be noted that siice the number of nominal stems was some what smaller than the number of verbal stems the figures in the nominal column have been artificially increased in each case in due propor tion so that they could be compared directly with

that stems in h k y s and tc occur with about the same frequency among both nouns and verbs While stems with initial c are more frequent among nouns than among verbs this may very probably be accounted for by the occurence of a prefix already alluded to and to be later discussed On the other hand there are distinctly more nominal stems with initial vowels  particularly initial o  and initial n and t Vowels are initial in nouns twice as LAST CONSONANT IN VERBAL AND NOMINAL STEMS Velb 59 55 53 28 22 20 19 i6 I5 I 5 12 IO 9 333 Noun  42 83 II 20 20 II 30 35 I4 I3 16 30 4NOS I2 THE TUNICA LANGUAGE5 often as with verbs and n and t are initial sounds nearly twice as often To counter balance this I and r are initial sounds in verbs twice as often as in nouns and mi p and w nearly three times as often It is possible that initial t may occur more frequently with nouns because the stem as I have recorded it con tains some form of the article ta but I have no explanation of any kind for the other facts noted particularly as Tunica prefixes are com paratively few The preponderance of labials as initial sounds in verbs is particularly striking Consideration of the last consonant usually the last phonetic in the stem but one is impor tant because Tunica is a suffixing language and it is quite possible that many of the disyl labic stems may prove to be compounds although of course there is no necessity that such should be the case On analyzing the facts contained in this table we find that tc h s y m and w occur in about equal proportions in this situation in both nouns and verbs or else they occur so sparingly that no attention need be paid to them k r n 1 and c occur a dis proportionately large number of times in nomi nal stems k in onefourth of the cases r in oneeighth n in more than onetenth and  and c in one eleventh In verb stems the lead ing sounds are r k and p which occur in about onesixth of the cases examined The number of occurrences of n and c with nouns does not have much significance by itself but gains such significance when we compare them with the occurences with verbs We then find that n occurs only onehalf as often and c one third as often among verbs The c cases as also the I cases include several in which these sounds are final and I believe that they indicate the presence of suffixes or structural com plexity in the noun itself In the same way the preponderance of ns seems to be due to a suffix na probably identical with a nounforming suffix to be considered later The prominence of p r and k with verbs and of k and r with nouns is due I believe to the presence of cer tain suffixes to be explained later We shall find the use of p five times as often with verbs as with nouns to be full of significance In considering the final vowels it is convenient to class the few forms in e under those in i and the few forms in o under those in u We then find that u appears to be used decidedly oftener with nouns than with verbs This may also be attributed to a suffix though I do not know that such a suffix can be isolated with certainty THE VERB The general nature of the verb stem has already been outlined Apparently the care with which plurality is indicated by affixes has prevented a considerable employment of distinct stems for singular and plural A careful examination seems to show but four cases of the kind all of them except one auxiliary verbs They are TO GO singular a plural ci TO BE singular a plural on TO CAUSE singular ta plural an or in TO EAT saku to eat one thing cimu to eat several kinds of food I have only one example of this last which is doubtful especially since singular dual and plural pro nominal affixes are all used with saku In the two first cases the dual stems are identical with those employed in the singular Reduplication is a feature of Tunica as it is of most of the other southeastern languages Where the verb or adjective stem consists of but one syllable the entire syllable is duplicated where it consists of two syllables the duplica tion is sometimes complete sometimes confin ed to the first syllable The following are all of the examples which my

NAME OF A WILD APPLE seems to mean  shooting up  The two following although nouns should evidently be inserted here The reduplication which they contain is evidently due to the fact that they are from verbal stems though the originals are not otherwise in use soksoxkana THE SWALLOWTAILED HAWK tciktciri THE CAROLINA WREN The verb complex consists normally of a single stem one or two prefixes and usually a much larger number of suffixes but some times there is an auxiliary in addition to the main stem and sometimes we find two or rarely three principal stems THE PRONOUNS AND PRONOMINAL AFFIXES The most remarkable feature of Tunica is the prominence given to the expression of sex This occurs in both nouns and verbs but is most marked in the verbs There are distinct masculine and feminine prefixes not only in the third person singular as with us but in the second and third persons of all three numbers singular dual and plural  and almost com plete sets for both subjective and objective relations The objective forms are always pre fixed the subjective forms are suffixed except when they are used with auxiliaries with which they are prefixed in all numbers and persons except the first person singular and the plural of two of the forms The following table gives a complete list of these affixes PRONOMINAL AFFIXES Singular Objective Subjective Ist pers ik 2d pers masc wik 2d pers fem

3d pers fer sin si siti When examined closely this complicated system is seen to be built up from a very small number of roots In the first place the dual is distinguished by the use of an n and the plural by a t This latter appears it is true only in the subjective forms but its absence from the objective forms may be explained by the fact that with one exception they are identical with the corresponding forms of the dual and may be supposed to have been adopted from them The exception noted is the form for the third person masculine and this is remarkable as containing a k which would otherwise appear to be a sign of the objective series in the singular This sign k is wanting in the subjective series but it is possible that it has been dropped off for harmonic reasons or because the subjective pronouns require no particular mark to distinguish them The root sound of forms in the first person except perhaps the subjective singular is plainly i The sign of the second person masculine in all numbers appears consistently as wi and hi or some near approach to it as the sign of the second person feminine The third person masculine in the singular and dual is indicat ed by u but X is wanting in the plural In the plural subjective form it has perhaps been dropped the original having been uta or uti instead of ta The third person plural mascu line is quite irregular combining a syllable otherwise used only for feminine forms in the dual and plural with the k characteristic of the singular objectives The root used in the femin ine singular is ti apparently unrelated to the si sign which we find in the dual and plural forms of that gender These divergencies must be the result of an evolution which it is now impossible to reconstruct The objective prefixes are also used as possessives Besides employing an indefinite singular in the subjective iti as given in the above table there is a marked tendency to use the mascu line plural suffix for the indefinite or the passive The corresponding feminine form seems to be wanting Examples rixk haxsanta A SAWED PIECE OF WOOD imat ikoxsonta I AM SCRATCHED THEY HAVE SCRATCHED ME ahekinta IT IS MIXED

DREN ALL CAME THERE It is perhaps for this reason that the plural forms sama and sinima are sometimes used like plural suffixes to nouns When sinima is employed in this manner it is usually contract ed to sin and this contracted form appears occasionally after nouns usually considered masculine It is possible therefore that sin was in process of becoming a true plural suffix to nouns without regard to gender The dual unima is sometimes employed in the same manner Examples eti sama hotu ALL MY KINSFOLK tOni mi sa ma THOSE MEN DOWN THERE toni mi u nima THOSE TWO MEN DOWN THERE ta Tcaxta

it after them for perhaps ta should be considered as an independent wordNOS I2 THE TUNICA LANGUAGE 9 Examples iwitaHIMSELF mata THYSELFm hamata THYSELF f umata THEIR 2 SELVES tixta HERSELF In addition to ta there is a suggestion of another reflexive cincorporated in the verb which is of interest because it is identical in form with reflexives found in both Natchez and Chitimacha The existence of such a prefix can not be asserted with positiveness but it is indicated by a considerable body of evidence Very likely it became atrophied in later times The evidence for this is as follows The stem of the verb meaning to think is niyu niyukani I THINK but icniyuki appears with the sense  I recollect  I remember  I reflect In this latter the objective pronom inal prefix is used in place of the subjective pronominal suffix but a c appears between it and the stem which is not accounted for This is however the kind of verb in which a reflexive is likely to appear Again we find a word pi tohata DO NOT LOSE YOURSELF in which the common reflexive tq seems to be used though in an unusual situation and the verb icpi toki I FORGET Unfortunately I have but one example of the first form This may also explain the first syllable of cri TO SMELL since rina signifies PERFUME and rici NOSE The expression used for A VIRGIN is nuxtci te tini yura A WOMAN WITH A HARD OR FIRM HEART and this suggests that ni ucra A MAN WHO CAN KEEP HIS OWN COUNCIL AND NOT TELL THINGS TO EVERYONE A DISCREET MAN may mean literally a man his hardness  or  a man his firmness c being this same prefix Another example is the word for witch ticlinaxtc which means  always renewing herself and is said to be formed from lina meaning  indestructible  The initial sound in ctuka TO BE ABLE may be the same prefix It is to be noted that most of the best examples are presented where there is very close personal ownership especially in connection with mental processes and this adds great importance to the fact that a number of names for parts of the body begin with two consonants of which the first is the one in question Thusicka is MY FOOT i cki MY BACKSIDES ictaxpuc MY FACE and to these may perhaps be added cteluac which signifies SPITTLE SLIME FOAM etc Moreover the words meaning mouth and forehead also begin with c vi ixciohu MY MOUTH ixcgmili MY FOREHEAD If the names of body parts beginning with s be added to these we have still more Oxsa HIS TAIL  ex jsini MY HEAD stakali PENIS estayi MY BODY  iXStuxsu MY EYE SU A WOMANS GENITALS More importance is to be attached to those words beginning in s followed by

and howaxta The endings ta and c are locative suffixes after nouns and demons tratives to be treated more at length presently At one time it appeared to the writer that two other locative prefixes must be added to the above ya toward speaker and yu away from speaker but further examination showed that these occurred only as prefixes to one verb or as parts of two independent verbs a point not yet determined It was also discovered that the stems yaka and yuka are inseparable and the pronominal objects stand before them whereas the true locatives always precede the prono minal prefixes

might be considered when we come to treat of the compounding of verb stems but they have become so closely bound up in the verb complex that it is best to con sider them as parts of it Furthermore these auxiliaries exhibit two peculiarities which set them distinctly apart from all other verbs The first of these is the fact that as already stated with one possible exception the auxiliaries are the only verbs which have different stems for singular and plural The second is the anoma lous position of the pronouns when used with them The auxiliaries are a sing ci plural TO GO  a sing on plural TO BE ta sing in or an plural TO CAUSE ana sing plural TO SIT  ara sing  plural TO REMAIN axsa sing  plural TO COME Defec tive material prevents me from telling whether the last three auxiliaries enumerated have separate plural stems or not and similarly the plural stem of the auxiliary to cause is known only by examples of the third person plural masculine There are also anomalies in the use of the two remaining plural stems since the pronominal affixes always precede ci but follow on In this particular in or an agrees with the latter There is still one more anomaly connected with the auxiliary to be which I do not feel sure that I have explained correctly I present my solution as the best I can give with the material at hand Since each of the verbs to go and to be has the same stem in the singular it would appear that considerable confusion might arise between them This is avoided however by the fact that the former is almost always accompanied by the perfect suffix xki or ki The association of the two is so intimate that it has at times seemed doubtful to the writer whether the stem was not rather axki or aki However there appear to be enough cases of the indepen dent use of a and ki to justify the conclusion to which I have arrived It is probably for this reason that the auxiliary frequently appears with the force of English  to have  Why the perfect suffix has not been added to on is still left unexplained Following are the cases of the use of these auxiliaries independently as recorded by Doctor Gatschet and myself ani I GO wia YOU m GO heya YOU f GO ua HE

JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL 2 auxiliary to be but we do not know the plu ral stems of ana ara and axsa The fact that the auxiliary to be  usually occurs combined with the perfect as axki suggests a possibility that ana ara and axsa may be similar com binations with suffixes na ra and sa or xsa but this can neither be proved nor disproved on the basis of the material available The above list contains one or two anomalies In the dual of the verb to go is an unexplained vowel a probably merely euphonic as is per haps the vowel in the third person plural mas culine which carries the accent The feminine forms in the third person singular are all irre gular Instead of taa we have ata and instead of taki tata tara and taxsa  aki ata ara and axsa the first consonant having seemingly been dropped Examples of the use of these auxiliaries with other verbs will be found throughout this sketch as also in the following list a ci TO GO saakua HE WENT ACROSS siknaxcuwa HE LED

is ami to go instead of ani In addition to the auxiliary to be  there is an independent verb of similar significance of which a word might be said This has been recorded by Doctor Gatschet and myself as axtca axtci or aitca In some of the examples possession appears to be indicated but this is probably only a special use The following are all of the examples that have so far come to my notice seoxta hikic axtcani BEADS WERE IN IT oni ri axtca THERE WAS A PERSONS HOUSE enaciakawe ri tale axtca WHEN HE BROUGHT ME THERE WAS A FINE HOUSE THERENOS I2 THE TUNICA LANGUAGE I3 laspiku ikaxtca I

A BIG CLUMP OF BRIARS THAr WAS THERE Before leaving the subject of auxiliaries reference must be made to indications of the existence or former existence of two other suffixes which seem to belong to this class From the data at hand it would appear either that these affixes were very closely bound to the stem or else that they were in process of losing their independence One of them is pa with a causative significance the other u of more uncertain meaning As the cases in which these appear are few each will be fully discussed by itself In opening my argument for the  at least former  existence of a p suffix with verbs let me first recall the comparative analysis of verbal and nominal stems given some pages back according to which verb stems in which the last consonant was p were found to be five times as numerous as the corresponding nomi nal stems This is full of significance when taken in conjunction with the proportions maintained by other sounds We have more specific evidence however The stem raxki signifies TO BE CLOSED SOMETHING TIGHT raxpa TO ENCLOSE TO CATCH BY ENCLOSING and raxpu A COVERING A COAT we also find stems koxpa TO SURROUND TO ENCLOSE and luxpa TO COLLECT TO GATHER as if the ele ment pa were essential to the thought in each Lahi means TO BURN as in iglahek I BURN MYSELF and laxpa has a similar meaning as ilaxpakati SHE IS BURNING ME icioho iglax pati I BURN MY MOUTH  she or it is burning my mouth  Taka means TO RUN AFTER TO PURSUE tapi TO CATCH TO GRASP and taxpa TO TOUCH Again kantuk utcukani means I AM SUCKING SOMETHING tcuxpakani I AM SUCKING OUT applied only to a doctor sucking blood from a wound perhaps with the significance  I am causing blood to be drawn out  The following forms found with the verb  to be a chief  seem also to contain this suffix tcoha piaxkjta I HAVE BEEN CHIEF and am such no longer tcoha ptnikaxtca I SHALL BE CHIEF  6ni tcoha ixki piuxki A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CHIEF  tCOha p BE CHIEF  itcoha pli BE OUR CHIEF tcoha ipi4 BE OUR CHIEF TAINESS  winima ili tcoha impwiti BE OUR CHIEFS  winima tcoha piwiti BE CHIEFS  hinima tcoha pihiti BE CHIEFTAINESSES  These forms are at least remarkable since the usual imperative sign is k or ki Other cases though not so clear may be cited as follows lexkini I POUR INTO lexpi TO ENCLOSE TO SHUT IN lixpU A BUTTON A BLISTER  kaxtc TO BITE p kp TO NIP or CUT as with scissors also the stem of the word for TONGS cf kaxti TO BUTTON TO LOCK kixti TO PINCH sihu DRY as iksihu I AM DRY sopi TO WIT HER or DRY UP as in rixku oracki sopun A LEAF WITHERED BY DRYNESS cikur KNIFE ciX kal ROCK and FLINT cixpa TO PRICK TO POINT The case for u is not so strong partly because it is frequently difficult to tell wether we are dealing with this suffix or the sign of the third person masculine As with the suffix just con sidered it is indicated by the fact that it appears strikingly oftener as a terminal sound to nouns than to verbs This might be supposed to14 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL 2 indicate a nominal suffix but in fact the mean ing which must be assigned to it as indicating something stationary of long continuance would tend to its frequent use as a nounforming suffix Such a view is suggested by the usage of similar suffixes in Chitimacha and the Muskhogean languages and in fact the existence of such a suffix in those tongues lends ad ditional support to the otherwise indicated presence of a similar suffix in this language More evidence is contained in the following examples laki IT IS NIGHT laa AT NIGHT Tafc mili yarakati THE RED RIVER IS FALLING  the Red river she is falling  Tauc mili yarata THE RED RIVER IS LOW urotkatg I AM NAILING SOMETHING YIxki ta rotani A NAIL mara mera CYLINDRICAL A ROLLER yanka merka A SPOOL OF THREAD tarku merkuniku A WOODEN BARREL sapi A WAVE sapiku THERE ARE WAVES hintowaran LET US GO WALKING TO HUNT  ai axkalai ta hinu LOCO MOTIVE  the walking thing that produces fire  Possibly this suffix is identical with the stem of the verb uki TO SIT TO REMAIN TO BE PLACED the second syllable of which may be in reality a perfect suffix to be noted pre sently If so however the association of u and ki has become almost inseparable and the same perfect suffix is used over again with it as aukuxki HE REMAINED HE HAD BEEN SEATED THE CONTINUATIVE SUFFIX This is ka or k its use is sufficiently illus trated by the following examples akani I AM GOING erikani I AM LIFTING pokani I AM SEEING fkimakani I AM PUSHING HIM lekati THE SETTING SUN irakati IT femn IS FLAPPING ikkaxtcakata THEY ARE BITING ME tomuksina THEY 2 WERE POUNDING uwita maxsikuta HE IS TURNING HIMSELF The regular position of this suffix is just before the pronoun or the auxiliary but when followed bythe future or negative suffixes it fol lows them Examples  sagunikaxtca  I WILL BE EATING   sagwinagaxtca  YOU 2 m WILL BE EATING   tcoha uwiyatakaxtca HE WILL BE CHIEF he sakuni ctukaha I CAN NOT EAT THAT  wahantakaha THEY DO NOT LIGHT UP THEY ARE NOT BRIGHT korinakaha WE 2 DO NOT DRINK THE PERFECT As already stated this is ki or xki Its intimate connection with the auxiliary a TO BE has been dwelt upon and examples of that usage have been given The following appear to be cases in which this suffix is connected directly with the principal verb stem although the weak character of the auxiliary stem

I AM CONCEALING MYSELF pihuxkini I AM CONCEALED I am inclined to see a contrast between a and i or ka and ki which if proved would bring Tunica in this particular in line with Choctaw The contrast between ka and ki is not marked in the material as it stands but this may be accounted for by the fact that ka is almost always suffixed to the principal stem while ki is more often attached to the auxiliary to be However it is possible that the examples given above are imperfect forms in ki intended either for the perfect suffix or for a modal suffix to be pre sently considered THE FUTURE

haxtci cka ukaxtci i HAS HE BITTEN SOMEONE  should be placed here as also the following hatikani yui GIVE ME MORE although the k is wanting It is not impossible that this suffix instead of being identical with that found in impera tives and interrogatives is merely another use of the perfect though in that case we must assume that it may be employed twice in the same form A few examples seem to indicate that there is another suffixed connective in k but the correctness of these is somewhat in doubt The examples are anik ikyaki IT IS NECESSARY FOR ME TO LEAVE sikcixkatanik igia gi haxtci I

this connection mention should be made of the coordinate conjunctions ma and cka which especially the former are evidently more closely connected with the preceding than with the following clause Thus in Tunica thought they evidently tend to an association with the subordinating verbal suffixes They will be considered more at length when we take up the conjunctions THE SUFFIX ni or n This is always

hoxtcixtc A LAME WOMAN There is evidence that sexuality has not in Tunica become a matter of grammar as in some European languages at least not for animate be ings Inanimate objects must have been classed into masculine and feminine since it was necessary to refer to them in the verb by either a masculine or a feminine particle and I have in fact a sex classification of many such objects although it is incomplete I confess a frank doubt regarding the rigidity of the system but it now appears to be impossible to settle the matter beyond question The gender of all of the nouns in the Tunica vocabulary collected by Gatschet is not given and in many cases the gender given has not been carefully established Nevertheless a study of the gender of those nouns whose classification has been obtained is interesting If reliance may be placed upon it the idea of sexuality was more important than sexuality as a grammati cal process Thus such words as male father and nephew are male  woman mother and sisterinlaw female while the sex of the vords for person parent child grandparent and for brotherinlaw and sisterinlaw where these are reciprocal changes with a change in the sex of the person to whom the term is applied The wotds for dog and cat take the masculine or feminine suffix according to theNOS I2 THE TUNICA LANGUAGE 23 sex of the dog or cat mentioned and there is every reason to believe that this indicates a general rule At the same timne most of the animal names recorded by Gatschet are given as of one sex or the other rabbit turtle dove beaver alligator hummingbird pig opossum cardinal bird fox otter elk being masculine and weasel feminine We may begin to suspect formal gender however in the case of the wood tick flea centipede ant gaspigou bedbug turtle crawfish chameleon lizard and certain other small animals and insects which appear as masculine The fact that none of these smaller creatures is given as feminine along with the further fact that the generic terms fish shell fish or bivalve bird and animal also appear as masculine may have significance regarding the classification of lower organisms There is some evidence that the gender of the parts of the body varied with the sex of the person mentioned At least I have the words for breast leg arm and apparently toe and finger given as both masculine and feminine though the others are divided the calf of the leg nose eye hip thigh hand wrist hair tooth heart navel knee bone and shoulderblade being masculine the liver bile spleen or milt lungs flesh head and sole of foot feminine The sexual organs are classed as might be expected and the word for milk is very naturally feminine I find the general word meaning skin or bark given as feminine but the word for deerhide compounded from it as masculine Among inanimate objects the wind dew a knife and fence appear as both masculine and feminine There may be an error in each case or in the case of knife a mans knife and a womans knife may be referred to respectively The following inanimate objects and abstractions are classed as masculine  housepost rock comb noise of thunder winter hoe clothesbrush brick a switch

white oak and grass are masculine sassafras pin oak grain or seed lima beans vegetables the harvest and a plantation are feminine The only points that come out from this at all clearly are the facts that diseases the seasons of the year and the divisions of the day are feminine A closer study of the texts would perhaps add a few entries to the above lists LOCATIVE SUFFIXES The existence of locative verbal prefixes has already been commented upon and connectives showing space relations and similar to our prepositions although actually they are post positions exist in Tunica But in addition to these there are three or four locative signs which are affixed so closely to the preceding noun that they may best be regarded as suf fixes They occur also after demonstratives and adverbs or postpositions indicating location They are the following c or ic The nearest English equivalent to this suffix appears to be  to  Position as the result of motion appears to be indicated Exam ples

sign is tu which appears with the masculine and feminine endings in the forms tuk tuxku tuxkutc tufhku tf huktc etc It should perhaps be regarded as an independent adjective but is frequently united

Adjectives are treated like intransitive verbs and take the same affixes When used with auxiliaries they may also take objective pronom inal prefixes It is among adjectives that we find the greatest number of cases of reduplica tion When in apposition to nouns adjectives may take the suffixes indicating gender and location The introduction of numerals and the ad jective hotu ALL into the verb has

only ma or rma and cka We have noted already that even in the case of these or at least the first of them there is a marked ten dency toward association with the preceding rather than with the following clause More often however it approximates the use of English  and  as in the following examples kiwuraotima oktcaamakani SHE PUT IT ON and SHE WENT AWAY nitima hakaliti SHE SPOKE THUS AND

SCRATCHED HERSELF ALL OVER AND THEN she wept This attachment of the idea to the preceding word is well illustrated by its employment in the connective hiarima  then  which has much the same

elements entering into nouns demonstratives and verbs are placed In the noun unless it is of immediate verbal origin it rarely happens that two affixes occur together in fact only two cases of the kind have come to my attention One of these is the use of the locative tik after either c or ta as  pikatictik uwa HE WENT TOWARD THE RISING SUN  kaxtatik FROM WHICH BANK OF THE RIVER  The second is where the diminutive is an integral part of the noun in which case it may take the suffixes indicating gender as ixkin tahbku THE LITTLE FINGER Properly however this is only a special case of the general rule in accordance with which the suffixes indicating gender may be suffixed to the adjec tive depending on a noun rather than the noun itself yota rotten rixku yotaku a rotten tree C and tik and ta and tik are combined after demonstratives as after nouns In hantu we have apparently the suffix n followed by the diminutive In the verb complex the locative prefix always precedes the objective pronominal prefix which in turn is immediately followed by the principal stem The adjective suffixes follow this stem immediately as does the continuative I have no examples of theuse of the latter in conjunction with the adjective suffixes but the perfect always follows them In the exam ples at my disposal the auxiliaries follow the continuative and never take a continuative suffix themselves but as already explained the auxiliary a occurs oftener with the perfect suffix than without it so that an impression is given that the perfect suffix occurs nearer the end of the word than does the continuative Another apparent inversion also explained above is found in the use of the pronominal subjects with the auxiliaries in all persons except the first person singular and excepting on and in the plural forms of the auxiliaries to be and to cause Still another irregularity already explained is in the position of the continuative before the future and negative suffixes which it immediately precedes in such cases coming after the pronominal suffixes The negative suffix and the suffix ki follow the sign of the future wherever we have an opportunity to test the matter and the infinitive suffix in xtc or tci is placed at the very end ma occurs of course at the very end In the following table I give a number of actual examples illustrating the structure of the verb32

peculiar to it It is a decidedy vocalic language with few conson antal clusters and exhibits a minimum number of phonetic changes In possessing a true r it is separated from all surrounding tongues the only other languages of the area which contain it being Timucua one dialect of Cherokee and the dialects of the Siouan tribes of the Carolinas Tunica is peculiar also in that the greater number of the apparent stems consist of two syllables It is a suffixing rather than a prefixing language but the total number of affixes is small Its most remarkable feature one which gives it a unique position among36 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS VOL 2 American languages is the possession of sex gender expressed in both noun and verb and particularly distinction of gender in the second person of the verb as well as the third The structure is in general loose the position of the various elements in the sentence being therefore of considerable importance but dependence on position is relieved to a con siderable extent by the elaborate pronominal system TUNICA TEXT THE TUNICA ASCEND RED RIVER AND SETTLE AT MARKSVILLE RECORDED BY Dr A S GATSCHET witcuxki 37 Hihiawima38 ta25 him up

determine the origin of the two elements or which part is the true stem ha is the negative suffix 85 Independent personal pronoun of the first person plural or dual It consists of ini which is used as the objective prefix in verbs and ma which is identical with the independent conjunction 86 Adjective long in all senses 87 amar is here employed as an adverb it is also used as a verb stem 88 This

people of this nation which was below on the Mississippi came up They went along with their canoes joined end to end The chief was in advance He called out to his friend He said to him  Let us eat  So he called all of his people and he landed After he had done so a Chickasaw gave him white hominy to eat He ate it and he made him his firm friend For that reason he led the Tunica chief to the Marksville prairie When he arrived he found an Avoyel Indian The Avoyel had his house in the earth The Tunica made him his friend They greeted each other They grasped each others hands They greeted each other by grasping each other on the upper arms That is why they have since owned the village Since then they have called it the Tunica village All of the old people over there are dead The young people keep up the language The place where they settled may still be seen And that proves this story to be true After this occasion the Chickasaw is not heard of No one knows where he went But the Tunica have always remained here although there are not many If there is a truer history regarding ourselves we do not know it Nevertheless this story has been known for a long enough time This story

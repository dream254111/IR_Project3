J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1013264,PHILADELPHIAS TRANSIT PROBLEM,I242642,PHILADELPHIAS TRANSIT PROBLEM BY A MERRITT TAYLOR DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CITY TRANSIT PHILADELPHIA LARGE CITIES OF THE UNITED STATES ARE CONSTANTLY OUTGROWING THE CAPACITY OF EXISTING FACILITIES FOR PUBLIC SERVICE AMONG THOSE FACILITIES WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY ESSENTIAL TO A CITYS DEVELOPMENT ARE WATER MAINS SEWERS AND TRANSPORTATION LINES THEY MAY BE LIKENED TO THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM OF THE HUMAN BODY WHEN THEY BECOME INADEQUATE AND CHOKE THE CIRCULATION WHICH THEY ARE DESIGNED TO CARRY OR WHEN THEY FAIL TO EXPAND AS THE BODY GROWS AND TO MEET ITS INCREASING REQUIREMENTS THE VARIOUS SECTIONS INVOLVED MUST WITHER AND THE BODY AS A WHOLE MUST SUFFER PHILADELPHIA IN COMMON WITH OTHER LARGE CITIES HAS OUTGROWN HER PRESENT URBAN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND IS PROCEEDING TO ESTAB LISH SUCH ADDITIONAL FACILITIES AS ARE REQUIRED TO FURNISH ADEQUATE SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CITY OF INDIVIDUAL HOMES SPREAD OVER A COMPARATIVELY LARGE AREA WE ARE NOW CONFRONTED WITH THE NECES SITY OF PROVIDING RAPID TRANSIT FACILITIES TO ELIMINATE EXISTING CONGES TION OF TRAFFIC AND THE EXCESSIVE LOSS OF TIME IN TRAVELING THE INCREAS INGLY GREAT DISTANCES BETWEEN AVAILABLE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT THE INEVITABLE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO CROWD THE FUTURE INCREASED POPULATION INTO FLATS AND TENEMENTS IN THE AREAS ALREADY BUILT UP SUCH CONDITIONS ARE BEYOND THE PALE OF CON SIDERATION STANDING SQUARELY BY THE ANCIENT ADVICE LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP THE CITY UNDERTOOK TWO YEARS AGO TO MAKE A PRACTICAL SCIEN TIFIC AND COMPLETE STUDY OF WHAT IS NEEDED AND OF WAYS AND MEANS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WERE EMBODIED IN THE REPORT OF THE TRANSIT COMMISSIONER IN 1913 AND WERE CRYSTALLIZED IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE IMMEDIATE CONSTRUCTION OF TWENTY SIX MILES OF HIGHSPEED LINES BY THE CITY TO BE EQUIPPED AND OPER ATED PREFERABLY BY THE EXISTING COMPANY WHICH CONTROLS PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE STREET RAILWAYS IN THE CITY NEGOTIATIONS WERE THEN UNDER TAKEN WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EXISTING COMPANY 28PHILADELPHIAS TRANSIT PROBLEM THE PROGRAM RESULTING FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE EXISTING COMPANY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CITY TRANSIT PROVIDES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN SUBWAY AND ELEVATED RAILWAY LINES BY THE CITY AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY 46000000 AND THE EQUIPMENT AND OPERATION THEREOF BY THE COMPANY IN COMMON WITH ITS EXISTING SYSTEM AS ONE GREAT UNIT FOR PUBLIC SERVICE THE COST OF EQUIPMENT WILL BE APPROXIMATELY 12000000 PROPER PROVISION IS ALSO MADE FOR FUTURE EXTENSIONS THE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR THE OPERATION OF ALL HIGHSPEED LINES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SURFACE SYSTEM WHICH WILL SERVE WITH OUT EXTRA CHARGE AS THE AGENT FOR THE GATHERING AND DISTRIBUTING OF PASSENGERS WHO USE THE HIGHSPEED LINES THUS THE ADVANTAGES OF RAPID TRANSIT WILL BE EXTENDED AS EQUALLY AS PRACTICABLE TO EVERY FRONT DOOR IN PHILADELPHIA PASSENGERS WILL BE ENABLED TO TRAVEL IN A FORWARD DIRECTION FOR ONE FIVECENT FARE BETWEEN EVERY IMPORTANT SECTION OF THE CITY AND EVERY OTHER IMPORTANT SECTION OF THE CITY CONVENIENTLY QUICKLY AND COMFORTABLY BY WAY OF THE COMBINED SURFACE AND HIGHSPEED LINES REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF TRANSFERS REQUIRED IN SO DOING RECENT LEGISLATION HAS CLOTHED THE CITY WITH THE LEGAL AUTHORITY FINANCIAL ABILITY AND EXECUTIVE MACHINERY TO CONSTRUCT AND IF NECES SARY TO EQUIP AND TO OPERATE THESE FACILITIES AS WELL AS SURFACE LINES A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IN PROCESS OF ADOPTION WILL PROVIDE MANY ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES IN FINANCING THE UNDERTAKING WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COMPANY IN ESTABLISHING THESE NEW FACILITIES IN A MANNER CAL CULATED TO BEST SERVE THE PUBLIC WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING AGAINST DESTRUCTIVE COMPETITION CAPITAL WHICH HAS BEEN INVESTED IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM THE PROGRAM AS ARRANGED PROVIDES THAT THE EXISTING COMPANY SHALL RECEIVE ANNUALLY OUT OF THE EARNINGS OF THE MUNICIPALLYOWNED LINES 1 INTEREST ON THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT 2 A FURTHER PAYMENT WHICH WILL SUSTAIN THE COMPANYS NORMAL NET INCOME GAINED PRIOR TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MUNICIPALLY OWNED LINE OR LINES AGAINST DECREASE OR LOSS DUE TO THE COMPANY PARTICIPATING IN THE COOPERATIVE PROGRAM AS STATED THEREIN IT FURTHER PROVIDES FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE DISCRIMINATORY EIGHTCENT EXCHANGE TICKET NOW IN USE IN CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE 29THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CITY IN A MANNER WHICH HAS BEEN ARRANGED BETWEEN THE OFFICIALS OF THE COMPANY AND THE DEPARTMENT THIS PROGRAM STILL AWAITS RATIFICATION BY THE UNDERLYING COM PANY WHICH IS CALLED UPON BY THE OPERATING COMPANY TO SUPPLY ANNUALLY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WHICH MAY BE NEEDED FOR THE NORMAL EXTENSION OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM PHILADELPHIANS ARE PRACTICALLY UNANIMOUS IN URGENTLY DEMAND ING RAPID TRANSIT FACILITIES AND FREE TRANSFERS NO INDIVIDUAL OR OBSTACLE CAN WITHSTAND THE UNITED PUBLIC IN THIS MATTER AS THE CITIZENS ARE DETERMINED TO ESTABLISH ADEQUATE RAPID TRANSIT FACILITIES THEY WILL BE ESTABLISHED WE EXPECT THE EXISTING COMPANIES TO WELCOME THE ADEQUATE PROTECTION WHICH THE PROGRAM FOR RAPID TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT AFFORDS THEIR STOCKHOLDERS AGAINST LOSS TO THEIR PRESENT NET INCOME BY REASON OF THEIR COOPERATION THE USE OF THE PUBLIC CREDIT IN SUCH AN ENTERPRISE AS THIS IS ESSENTIAL AND ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED THE CITY GETS AN ALMOST INDISPEN SABLE MODERN UTILITY THE PEOPLE OBTAIN WIDE AND COMFORTABLE RANGE OF MOVEMENT AND ENORMOUS AND VALUABLE TIME SAVING THE CITY GETS GREAT INCREASES IN TAXABLE VALUES AND A REVENUE PRODUCING PROP ERTY WHICH WITH THE GROWTH OF THE CITY WILL NOT ONLY BECOME MORE THAN SELFSUPPORTING BUT WILL REAP OUT OF EARNINGS ITS ENTIRE COST THE CITY WILL THUS ULTIMATELY OWN THE HIGHSPEED SYSTEM AS A GREAT INCOMEPRODUCING MUNICIPAL ASSET WITH THE ENTIRE COST THEREOF REPAID OUT OF EARNINGS WE ARE NOW DESIGNING AND PREPARING TO CONSTRUCT THE RECOM MENDED SUBWAY AND ELEVATED RAILWAY LINES THAT THEY WILL BE CON STRUCTED AND OPERATED THERE IS NO DOUBT FOR IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE UPON THE PART OF THE EXISTING COMPANY TO CO6PERATE AS PROVIDED AN INDEPENDENT OPERATOR CAN READILY BE OBTAINED TO EQUIP AND OPERATE THE MUNICIPALLYOWNED HIGHSPEED LINES UPON FAVORABLE TERMS AS A VERY LAST RESORT THE CITY ITSELF IS THOROUGHLY COMPETENT TO EQUIP AND OPERATE THE FACILITIES TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY AS A MUNICI PAL UNDERTAKING WE DO NOT EXPECT THE EXISTING COMPANY TO CO6PERATE WITH THE CITY IN ESTABLISHING THE RAPID TRANSIT LINES IN A MANNER WHICH WILL REDUCE ITS EXISTING NET INCOME ON THE CONTRARY WE ARE EXTENDING TO THE EXISTING COMPANY ADEQUATE PROTECTION AGAINST ANY SUCH LOSS IN CONSIDERATION OF ITS COOPERATION THEREFORE NO LOSS CAN COME TO 30PHILADELPHIAS TRANSIT PROBLEM THE COMPANY BY REASON OF THE CITYS ACTION UNLESS THE COMPANY SHOULD DECLINE TO CO6PERATE AND TO ACCEPT THE PROTECTION PROFFERED BY THE CITY I HAVE NOW COME TO THE POINT WHICH I WISH TO PARTICULARLY EMPHASIZE PHILADELPHIANS STAND FOR A SQUARE DEAL BETWEEN THE CITY AND VESTED INTERESTS WE RECOGNIZE THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF HONESTLY PROTECTING CAPITAL INVESTED IN PHILADELPHIA TO THE EXTENT THAT IT SHALL PRODUCE AN ATTRACTIVE RETURN FOR REASONABLE SERVICE RENDERED TO THE PUBLIC IN THE CASE OF OUR LOCAL RAILWAY SYSTEM A CONTRACT WAS ENTERED INTO IN 1907 BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COMPANY WITH THETERMS OF THIS CONTRACT IN FORCE AS A BASIS IT IS THE POLICY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CITY TRANSIT IN ESTABLISHING THE HIGHSPEED LINES UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CO6PERATIVE PROGRAM TO PROTECT THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT OF ITS ANNUAL NET EARNINGS GAINED PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE MUNICI PALLYOWNED LINES REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL ACTUALLY IN VESTED IN THE PROPERTY WE WANT PHILADELPHIA TO STAND OUT AS A SAFE PLACE FOR THE INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL FOR PUBLIC SERVICE WE RECOGNIZE THE GREAT PART WHICH THE RAILROADS AND OTHER PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATIONS CAN TAKE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS CITY AND ITS INDUSTRIES BUT TO SO TAKE THIS PART THEY MUST HAVE CREDIT UPON WHICH TO RAISE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY AND THEY MUST BE ASSURED OF AN ADEQUATE AND ATTRACTIVE RETURN THEREON AND IMMUNITY FROM UNWARRANTED COMPETITION OR POLITICAL AND PUBLIC ATTACKS THE CAPITALISTS OF THIS COUNTRY ARE GOING TO INVEST THEIR MONEY IN COMMUNITIES WHERE CAPITAL IS JUSTLY TREATED AND PERMITTED TO EARN ATTRACTIVE RETURNS AND ARE NOT GOING TO INVEST CAPITAL IN COMMUNITIES WHERE ITS SECURITY IS IMPAIRED AND ITS PRODUCTIVENESS IS UNDULY CURTAILED BY UNREASONABLE LEGISLATION REGULATION OR COMPETITION I BELIEVE THAT THE TIME IS PAST WHEN CORPORATIONS THROUGH POLITICAL FINANCIAL OR OTHER INFLUENCE CAN RETARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESOURCES OF OUR GREAT CITIES MAKE UNFAIR BARGAINS FOR FRAN CHISES OR REFUSE TO CO6PERATE UPON JUST TERMS IN CARRYING OUT GREAT MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS WHICH ARE DEPENDENT UPON THEIR CO6PERATION ON THE OTHER HAND I BELIEVE THE TIME IS AT HAND WHEN COWARDLY PUBLIC OFFICIALS WILL NOT BE PERMITTED BY THE THINKING PUBLIC TO BE LED BY BLACKMAILERS AND DEMAGOGUES INTO IMPOSING UNREASONABLE AND 3132 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ONEROUS TERMS AND CONDITIONS UPON CORPORATIONS AND VESTED INTER ESTS THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO MAKE POLITICAL CAPITAL BY PUR SUING ANY SUCH COURSE IN AN ENLIGHTENED COMMUNITY THE PEOPLE OF PHILADELPHIA WILL BE FAIR WITH CORPORATIONS AND WITH CAPITAL BUT THEY WILL DEMAND THE SAME FAIRNESS FROM COR PORATIONS AND CAPITAL IN RETURN ONLY THOSE WHO FAIL TO HEED THIS PUBLIC DEMAND NEED FEAR THE INEVITABLE DISASTER WHICH THE IRE OF AN INCENSED PUBLIC FOCUSED ON THEM FROM EVERY ANGLE IS SURE TO BRING ABOUT

to do Weeks and months and sometimes years of tedious experimenting dauntless patience and unflagging industry have marked his onward march to victory from the beginning until now His is a splendid example of scientific pertinacity rarely if ever surpassed in the his tory of human achievement Ie has won and held the admiration of the world and his in fluence must remain as a permanent source of inspiration both within the schools and without RICHARD C MACLAURIN MAssACHUSETTS INSTITUTE rF TECHNOLOGY THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY AS A MEDIUM OF PUBLICATION THE establishment of monthly Proceedings by the National Academy of Sciences in which the first announcements of new advances are made has met with instant recognition by a wide circle of investigators Eightythree original papers have appeared in the first five numbers and the inflow of manuscripts is con tinually increasing Many university depart ments and several research laboratories namely the Rockefeller Medical Institute the Lick and Yerkes Observatories the Nutrition Experimental Evolution and Marine Biolog ical Laboratories and the Mount Wilson Ob servatory of the Carnegie Institution and the Research Laboratories of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have already indicated their intention of adopt ing the Proceedings as their regular medium for announcing new and important results The success of the Proceedings is therefore amply assured The need of a national journal representing the joint interests of science as a whole and providing for the prompt publication and wide distribution of the chief results of American research has been felt in every department of science The vigorous developments of sci ence in recent years have carried us past the time when all of the special journals could assure early publication and their very multi plicity has stood in the way of wide foreign 815 circulation Four leading American journals of biology have an average paid foreign cir culation of 93 copies maximum 109 minimum 77 This is not due to any inferiority in quality as all of these journals are of the first rank Nor does it indicate that they are un desirable places to publish On the contrary they have come into existence to meet a nat ural demand and they certainly afford the most satisfactory means of publishing extended technical papers intended for investigators in the fields which they represent The Proceed ings are expected to supplement them and should aid materially in increasing their cir culation for authors are requested to adopt the uniform practise of referring in each article to the journal in which the details of their investigations will subsequently appear Such frequent references seen by a wide circle of readers will soon have their effect It is in the character and scope of their circulation that the Proceedings will perform their best service Truly national in char acter with a membership elected on equal terms from all sections of the country and serving as the representative of the United States in the International Association of Academies the National Academy of Sciences is peculiarly fitted to bring its publications to the attention of foreign readers In Europe the academy is regarded as the natural repre sentative of American research and this fact gives at once to the Proceedings an authorita tive standing among foreign investigators As foreign secretary of the academy I have been called upon to prepare with the coopera tion of the editors representing all departments of science a comprehensive list of foreign exchanges Every effort has been made to secure a wellbalanced distribution From the extensive data in Minerva relating to acad emies societies universities seminars general and special libraries laboratories observatories museums botanical and zoological gardens biological stations geological surveys and other centers of study and research a repre sentative group of about 900 foreign institu tions has been compiled In preparing this mailing list use has also been made of the exN S VOL XLI No 1066 change lists of the Royal Society and other similar bodies Bibliographical bureaus year books and journals giving special attention to abstracts and reviews have been included in the mailing list Chief stress however has been laid on placing the Proceedings in the leading research centers including university departmental libraries when these are of suffi cient significance In many cases it by no means suffices to send the Proceedings to a general university library they must also be readily accessible in the departments and seminars where the work of research is mainly done Such a distribution will obviate the neces sity felt by some American investigators of publishing their papers in foreign journals They may now secure the circulation they de sire by presenting their chief results in the Proceedings and the details in an American special journal Publication in the Proceedings will also have the advantage of bringing researches in one department of science to the attention of scholars in other departments who would otherwise fail to see them In a period when many of the greatest advances are being made in the fields lying between the traditional branches of science and when the wide adap tability of various methods of research is being repeatedly demonstrated it is unnecessary to dwell upon this point It may only be men tioned by way of example that a wellknown physicist has recently spoken to me of the ad vantage of seeing in the Proceedings short astronomical papers which he would not have opportunity to read in their more extended form As readers in widely separated fields may be expected authors should make their papers as clear and as readable as possible The papers should open with a statement of the purpose in view and the broader bearing or antecedent conditions of the investigation and should close with a summary of results The papers should be short of two to six pages in length but they should not be mere abstracts devoid of interest except as a bare statement of facts but complete and wellrounded articles ground ing their conclusions upon a substantial basis of calculations observations or experiments though free from all unnecessary technicalities and details and from extensive tabulations of data They should always appear in the Pro ceedings prior to their publication in special journals While serving the purposes already enumer ated the Proceedings will attempt also to con tribute to the popularization of scientific re search Nothing could be more injurious to the public appreciation of science than its current distortion by the newspapers Mr Mfelville E Stone general manager of the Associated Press feels this no less keenly than the men whose work is so often misrepresented by reporters He would heartily welcome means of securing reliable statements of progress in science expressed in clear and un sensational form for use by the Associated Press By an arrangement with him the editors of the Proceedings will attempt to supply suitable statements based upon such articles as are of sufficient general interest and importance Authors who prefer not to have their articles used in this way may notify the editors Every effort will be made to se cure clear and dignified statements expressed whenever possible in the authors own lan guage The experiment is not without its difficulties and success may not be attained at once It nevertheless seems important to make the attempt in order to counteract in some measure the present unfortunate condi tion of affairs Provision will also be made for a review of the papers published in the Proceedings in the widely circulated journals of general sci ence Thus such a review will appear regularly in the columns of SCIENCE and an arrange ment has been made with the editor of Nature for the publication of reports on the monthly issues of the Proceedings The Scientific American which is conducted in a very cred itable manner will also through an arrange ment made with its managing editor Mr Waldemar Kaempfert present accounts of the articles of popular interest In closing this paper in which I have tried to indicate how the Proceedings of the Na tional Academy may serve as a prompt and 816 SCIENCEJUNE 4 1915 SCIENCE convenient means of announcing and circu lating the chief results of research I should perhaps add a word to those who have not yet contributed to their pages Papers are ac cepted solely on their merits from nonmem bers as well as from members of the Academy To facilitate the work of the editors it is re quired that papers by nonmembers be trans mitted to the managing editor by a member but neither the manner of printing nor the se quence of the papers in the Proceedings is affected by this fact Further information may be obtained from Professor A A Noyes chairman of the board

overwhelmingly in favor of the Great Northern Railroad which stops at Glacier National Park arrangements have been made with this road for the party to leave Chicago at 505 PM Thursday August 26 One and one half days will be spent at Glacier National Park and Seattle will be reached at 6 PM August 30 August 31 September 1 and 2 will be spent at Seattle and on the even ing of September 2 the party will take a special train to Mt Ranier National Park where they will remain on Friday September 3 leaving there that evening and arriving at Portland the following morning spending the day in Port land as the guests of the Oregon Section leav ing Portland Saturday night passing through the Mt Shasta and Mt Lassen region on Sun day and arriving in San Francisco Sunday evening At San Francisco the party will break up returning via any route they choose The roundtrip rates from Chicago are 80 The sleeping car rates from Chicago to San Francisco by the route of the special train are as follows Lower berth 2250 upper berth 1800 compartment 6300 drawing room 8000 There will be an additional Pullman charge to Mt Ranier National Park which will how ever be little if any more than hotel accommo dations should the party remain in Seattle There may be also a small additional Pullman charge for holding the train at Glacier and Portland There will be a charge of 1250 for 114 miles of automobile trip and 20 miles of launch trip in Glacier National Park and 500 for the side trip through Tacoma to Mt Ranier National Park The hotel rates in Glacier National Park are from 300 to 500 per day on the American plan Those who wish may spend the night at Many Glacier Camp instead of at GoingtotheSun Camp  on the night of August 29 which will give them plenty of time to take a side trip to the wonderful Iceberg Lake on the morning of the 29th As the Great Northern passes the very gates of Glacier National Park a trip through the park is a very simple matter The tremendous mountain land of Glacier National Park sits high up in the Rocky Mountains of north western Montana and stretches to the Cana dian border The park is of 1525 square miles extent with a veritable army of magnificent peaks rising from 8000 to 10000 feet with their bases thickly timbered and their lime stone crests painted in many colorsreds browns blues and purples On the tops of these mountains are 20 glaciers every bit as inspiring as those ice fields which Americans have been crossing to Switzerland to see of these the great Blackfeet Glacier has an area of five miles There are more than 250 glacier fed blue mountain lakes So well have the most important sections of the park been linked by government auto stage roads that it is now possible to see within a short time what formerly required weeks to visit So much has been written about the wonders of Mt Ranier National Park that there is little need to add detail here The following quotation from the Travelers Magazine will be sufficient Read as much about it as you will see it pictured a thousand times and be lieve all the tales you hear of it and on going there you will find that it has been underrated It is hard to believe when you see it Mt Ranier is the highest mountain in the United States and has a glacial system greater than that of the whole Swiss Alps The National 817

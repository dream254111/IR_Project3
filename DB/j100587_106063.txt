EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE WATERS OF BUXTON AND MATLOCK IN DERBYSHIRE BY THOMAS PERCIVAL OF MAN CHESTER M D AND F R S T H E WATER OF SAINT ANNSWELL IS FOUND BY ANALYSIS TO CONTAIN CAL CAREOUS EARTH FOSSIL ALKALI AND SEA SALTS BUT IN VERY SMALL PROPORTIONS FOR A GALLON OF THE WATER WHEN EVAPORATED YIELDS ONLY TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY FOUR GRAINS OF SEDIMENT IT STRIKES A LIGHT GREEN COLOUR WITH SYRUP OF VIOLETS SUFFERS NO CHANGE FROM AN INFUSION OF GALLS FROM THE FIXED VEGETABLE ALKALI OR FROM THE MINERAL ACIDS BECOMES MILKY WITH THE VOLATILE ALKALI AND WITH SACCHARUM SATURNI AND LETS FALL A PRECIPITATE ON THE ADDITION OF A FEW DROPS OF A SOLUTION OF SILVER IN THE NITROUS ACID THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THIS WATER IS PRECISELY EQUAL TO THAT OF RAIN WATER WHEN THEIR TEMPERATURES ARE THE SAME BUT IT WEIGHS FOUR GRAINS IN A PINT LIGHTER WHEN FIRST TAKEN FROM THE SPRING THE HEAT OF THE BATH IS ABOUT 82 DEGREES OF FAHRENHEITS THERMOMETER THAT OF SAINT ANNS WELL AS IT IS A SMALLER BODY OF WATER AND EXPOSED TO THE OPEN AIR IS SOMEWHAT LESS THE WATER IS TRANSPARENT SPARKLING AND HIGHLY GRATEFUL TO THE PALATE  READ JUNE 25 1772  I AM INDEBTED TO THE INFORMATION OF THE WORTHY PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDS AT BUXTON FOR SOME OF THESE FACTS IN456 IN OCTOBER 1769 I PASSED A FEW DAYS AT BUXTON AND DURING MY STAY THERE AMUSED MYSELF WITH THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS ON THE EFFECTS OF THE WATER OF SAINT ANNS WELL ON MY PULSE E X P E R I M E N T I OCTOBER 12 EIGHT OCLOCK IN THE MORNING THE DAY COLD AND MOIST MY PULSE BEAT 84 STROKES IN A MINUTE I DRANK AT THE WELL THE THIRD OF A PINT OF WATER AND USING EVERY NECESSARY PRECAUTION EXA MINED MY PULSE AT CERTAIN INTERVALS OF TIME IN FIVE MINUTES PULSE 80 IN TEN MINUTES PULSE 80 FULLER AND HARDER IN TWENTY MINUTES PULSE 85 IN HALF AN HOUR PULSE 90 E X P E R I M E N T II ELEVEN OCLOCK IN THE FORENOON TWO HOURS AFTER BREAKFAST THE AIR WARM AND SERENE PULSE 90 I RE PEATED THE DRAUGHT OF WATER IN SEVEN MINUTES PULSE 109 IN FIFTEEN MINUTES PULSE 103 IN THIRTY MINUTES PULSE 100 HEADACH IN AN HOUR AND A HALF PULSE 95 HEADACH ABATED E X P E R I M E N T III OCTOBER 13 EIGHT IN THE MORNING THE DAY COLD PULSE 92 I DRANK THE QUANTITY OF WATER ABOVEMEN TIONED IN FIVE MINUTES PULSE 86 IN FIFTEEN MINUTES PULSE 86 FULL AND HARD IN TWENTY MINUTES PULSE 100 IN HALF AN HOUR PULSE 92 FROM THE FIRST AND THIRD EXPERIMENTS IT APPEARS THAT THE COLDNESS OF THE MORNING COUNTERACTED FOR A TIME THE EFFECTS OF THE BUXTON WATER AND REDUCED THE457 THE VIBRATIONS OF MY PULSE FROM 84 TO 80 AND FROM 92 TO 86 BUT THE STIMULUS OF THE WATER SOON BE CAME SUPERIOR TO THE SEDATIVE POWERS OF THE COLD TO WHICH I WAS EXPOSED FOR WITHIN THE SPACE OF HALF AN HOUR MY PULSE ROSE TO 90 IN THE FIRST AND TO 100 STROKES IN THE SECOND TRIAL AT ELEVEN OCLOCK BE FORE NOON WHEN THE AIR WAS WARM AND SERENE THE WATER IN A MUCH SHORTER TIME EXCITED ITS FORCE IN CREASING THE VELOCITY OF MY PULSE FROM 90 TO 109 VIBRATIONS IN A MINUTE THESE EXPERIMENTS EVINCE THE HEATING QUALITY OF BUXTON WATER AND SUGGEST TO US THE PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN THE USE OF IT SMALL QUANTITIES SHOULD ONLY BE DRUNK AT ONCE AND FREQUENTLY REPEATED THE BELLY SHOULD BE KEPT SOLUBLE WITH LENITIVE ELECTUARY OR ANY OTHER MILD PURGATIVE AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COURSE THE PATIENT MAY BE DIRECTED TO SUFFER THE WATER TO REMAIN A FEW SE CONDS IN THE GLASS BEFORE HE SWALLOWS IT FOR THIS CELEBRATED SPRING ABOUNDS WITH A MINERAL SPIRIT OR MEPHITIC AIR IN WHICH ITS STIMULUS AND INDEED ITS EFFICACY RESIDES AND WHICH IS QUICKLY DISSIPATED BY EXPOSURE TO THE AIR THE HONOURABLE AND INGENIOUS MR CAVENDISH HAS SHEWN BY HIS EXPERIMENTS ON RATHBONE PLACE WATER PH TRANSACTIONS VOL LVII THAT CALCAREOUS EARTHS MAY BE RENDERED SOLUBLE IN WATER BY FURNISHING THEM WITH MORE THAN THEIR NATURAL PROPERTY OF FIXED AIR AND IT HAS LATELY BEEN DISCOVERED THAT IRON ALSO MAY BE SUSPENDED BY THIS PRINCIPLE IN THE SAME MENSTRUM  IT APPEARED THEREFORE HIGHLY PROBABLE TO ME THAT A CHALYBEATE IMPREGNATION MIGHT WITH GREAT FACILITY  VID MR LANES EXPERIMENTS PH TRANSACTIONS VOL LIX V O L LX II N N N BE458 BE COMMUNICATED TO THE BUXTON WATER WHEN FRESH DRAWN FROM THE SPRING A QUALITY WHICH IN MANY CASES WOULD ADD GREATLY TO ITS MEDICINAL EFFICACY I SUGGESTED THE TRIAL TO MR BUXTON A VERY WORTHY AND SENSIBLE APOTHECARY NEAR THE WELLS WHO HAS LATELY AT MY REQUEST MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT E X P E R I M E N T IV A QUART BOTTLE CONTAINING TWO DRACHMS OF IRON FILINGS WAS FILLED BY IMMERSION WITH THE WATER OF SAINT ANNES WELL CORKED AND AGITATED BRISKLY UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IT WAS THEN SUFFERED TO RE MAIN IN THE WELL TILL THE FILINGS HAD SUBSIDED WHEN THE WATER WAS CAREFULLY DECANTED INTO A HALF PINT GLASS TO THIS WERE ADDED THREE DROPS OF THE TINCTUREOF GALLS WHICH IMMEDIATELY OCCASIONED A DEEP PURPLE COLOUR AND TRANSPARENCY WAS PRESENTLY RESTORED BY A FEW DROPS OF THE ACID OF VITRIOL EVIDENT PROOFS THAT A SOLUTION OF THE IRON WAS EFFECTED IN A FEW MINUTES THE WATER ALSO WITHOUT THE TINCTURE OF GALLS HAD A CHALYBEATE TASTE AND LEFT AN AGREEABLE ASTRINGENCY ON THE PALATE BY THIS EXPERIMENT IT APPEARS THAT A WARM CHALY BEATE ABOUNDING WITH A MINERAL SPIRIT AND GRATEFUL TO THE TASTE MAY WITH VERY LITTLE TROUBLE BE OBTAINED AND THIS METHOD OF IMPREGNATING THE BUXTON WATER WITH IRON MUST INCREASE ITS TONIC POWERS AND IN MANY CASES IMPROVE ITS MEDICINAL VIRTUES IT IS A COMMON PRACTICE TO JOIN THE USE OF A CHALYBEATE SPRING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ST ANNES WELL WITH THAT OF THE BUXTON WATER BUT THE SUPERIORITY OF THE ARTIFICIAL MINERAL WATER MUST BE APPARENT IF WE CONSIDER ITS AGREEABLE WARMTH VOLATILITY LEVITY AND GRATEFULNESS TO THE PALATE BUXTON459 BUXTON BATH IS VERY FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED AS A TEM PERATE COLD BATH FOR AS THE HEAT OF THE WATER IS ABOUT SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN DEGREES BELOW THAT OF THE HUMAN BODY A GENTLE SHOCK IS PRODUCED ON THE FIRST IMMERSION THE HEART AND ARTERIES ARE MADE TO CON TRACT MORE POWERFULLY AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS BRACED AND INVIGORATED BUT THIS SALUTARY OPERATION MUST BE GREATLY DIMINISHED OFTEN INDEED MORE THAN COUNTERBALANCED BY THE RELAXING VAPOURS WHICH COPIOUSLY EXHALE FROM THE BATH TO WHICH THE PA TIENTS ARE EXPOSED DURING THE TIME OF DRESSING AND UN DRESSING A SEPARATE ROOM IS INDEED PROVIDED FOR THE LADIES BUT THE GENTLEMEN HAVE NO OTHER ACCOM MODATIONS THAN WHAT THE VAULT AFFORDS IN WHICH THE BATH IS CONTAINED AND ARE THEREFORE LIABLE TO ALL THE INCONVENIENCES ARISING FROM WARMTH AND MOISTURE JUNE 12 1772 THE MERCURY STOOD IN THE SHADE AT 65 BUT IN THIS VAULT QUICKLY AROSE TO 78 DEGREES EXPERIMENTS ON M A T L O C K W A T E R E X P E R I M E N T I A THERMOMETER MADE BY DOLLOND AND GRADUATED ACCORDING TO FAHRENHEITS SCALE WAS EXPOSED FOR A SUFFICIENT LENGTH OF TIME TO THE STEAM OF THE WA TER AS IT GUSHES FROM THE ROCK AND ALSO IMMERSED IN THE BASON THAT RECEIVES IT THE MERCURY ROSE TO 66 DEGREES E X P E R I M E N T II SIX DROPS OF SP SAL AMMON VOL WERE POURED INTO A GLASS OF THE SPRING WATER WHICH CONTAINED N N N 2 ABOUT460 ABOUT THE SIXTH OF A PINT A VERY SLIGHT CLOUDINESS IMMEDIATELY ENSUED BUT NO PRECIPITATION WAS AFTER WARDS OBSERVABLE E X P E R I M E N T III SIX DROPS OF A SOLUTION OF SALT OF TARTAR OCCASIONED A CLOUDINESS JUST PERCEPTIBLE IN THE SAME QUANTITY OF WATER NO PRECIPITATION ENSUED E X P E R I M E N T IV SIX DROPS OF A SOLUTION OF SACCHARUM SATURNI IM MEDIATELY PRODUCED A MILKINESS IN THE WATER BUT NO SENSIBLE PRECIPITATION E X P E R I M E N T V SIX DROPS OF A SOLUTION OF SILVER IN THE NITROUS ACID INSTANTLY OCCASIONED A MILKINESS IN THE WATER AND AFTER STANDING AN HOUR A GREY POWDER WAS OBSERVA BLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS E X P E R I M E N T VI TEN DROPS OF THE INFUSION OF GALLS NEITHER PRO DUCED ANY CHANGE OF COLOUR IN THE WATER AT THE TIME THEY WERE ADDED NOR WAS THE SLIGHTEST PURPLE HUE PERCEPTIBLE TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS E X P E R I M E N T VII A PIECE OF PAPER BESMEARED WITH SYRUP OF VIOLETS WAS DIPPED INTO A GLASS FULL OF WATER NO CHANGE OF COLOUR ENSUED EXPE461 E X P E R I M E N T VIII ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER MOISTENED IN THE SAME MANNER WITH THE SYRUP WAS PLACED OVER A GLASS OF WATER AS SOON AS IT WAS TAKEN FROM THE SPRING THE PAPER SUFFERED NO CHANGE OF COLOUR ALTHOUGH IT RE MAINED AN HOUR UPON THE GLASS E X P R R I M E N T IX MY PULSE BEAT 84 STROKES IN A MINUTE AT THE TIME WHEN I DRANK A HALF PINT GLASS OF THE MATLOCK WA TER IN 20 MINUTES MY PULSE ROSE TO 86 IN HALF AN HOUR AFTER THEY SUNK TO 82 AND CONTINUED TO VIBRATE THE SAME NUMBER OF TIMES FOR AN HOUR WHICH WAS AS LONG AS I THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THEM E X P E R I M E N T X THE MERCURY IN THE THERMOMETER WHEN IMMERSED IN EACH OF THE BATHS STOOD AT 68 IN THE RIVER DER WENT WHICH FLOWS THROUGH THE VALLEY OF MATLOCK AT 52 THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE IN THE MONTH OF JUNE 1772 AND THE WEATHER WAS WARM E X P E R I M E N T XI A FOUR OUNCE PHIAL AFTER BEING ACCURATELY COUNTER POISED IN A VERY NICE BALANCE WAS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH DISTILLED WATER WHICH WEIGHED THREE OUNCES FOUR DRACHMS FORTY FIVE GRAINS AND A HALF THE SAME PHIAL EXACTLY BALANCED AS BEFORE WAS THEN FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH MATLOCK WATER OF THE SAME TEM PERATURE462 PERATURE WITH THE DISTILLED WATER WHICH WEIGHED THREE OUNCES FOUR DRACHMS AND FORTY SIX GRAINS MATLOCK WATER IS GRATEFUL TO THE PALATE AND OF AN AGREEABLE TEMPERATURE BUT EXHIBITS NO MARKS OF ANY MINERAL SPIRIT EITHER BY ITS TASTE SPARKLING APPEAR ANCE IN THE GLASS OR BY THE CHEMICAL TEST EMPLOYED IN EXPERIMENT 8 THE SECOND AND THIRD EXPERI MENTS SHEW THAT IT IS VERY SLIGHTLY IMPREGNATED WITH SELENITES OR OTHER EARTHLY SALTS AND OF THIS ITS COMPARATIVE LEVITY AFFORDS ALSO A FURTHER PROOF FOR IT WEIGHS TWENTYSIX GRAINS IN A PINT LIGHTER THAN THE MANCHESTER PUMP WATER AND ONLY FOUR GRAINS HEAVIER THAN DISTILLED WATER THE PRECIPITATION OF A GREY POWDER BY THE ADDING OF A SOLUTION OF SILVER IN AQUA FORTIS TO THE WATER RENDERS IT PROBABLE THAT A SMALL PORTION OF SEA SALT IS CONTAINED IN IT FOR THE POWDER IS FOUND TO CONSIST OF THE PARTICLES OF SILVER COMBINED WITH THE MURIATIC ACID WHICH IS SEPARATED FROM THE FOSSIL ALKALI BY THE SUPERIOR AFFINITY THE NITROUS ACID BEARS TO IT AND THUS A DOUBLE ELEC TIVE ATTRACTION TAKES PLACE IN THIS EXPERIMENT THIS WATER IS SAID TO CONTAIN IRON BUT THE ASSER TION IS AT LEAST RENDERED DOUBTFUL BY THE 6TH EXPERI MENT WHICH WAS MADE WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT IT IS ENTIRELY WITH OUT FOUNDATION THE SPRING IS JUSTLY CELEBRATED FOR ITS EFFICACY IN HAEMOPTOES AND HENCE IT MAY HAVE BEEN TOO HASTILY CONCLUDED THAT IT POSSESSES SOME SLIGHT DEGREE OF STYPTICITY BY MEANS OF A CHALYBEATE IMPREGNATION  VID THE AUTHORS TREATISE ON THE PUMP WATER OF MANCHES TER ESSAYS MEDICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL P 207 2D EDIT THE463 THE 9TH EXPERIMENT WHICH MY SHORT STAY AT MATLOCK WOULD NOT ALLOW ME LEISURE TO REPEAT AF FORDS A PRESUMPTION THAT THE WATER IS NOT POSSESSED OF ANY STIMULATING POWERS FOR THE SMALL INCREASE OF QUICKNESS IN MY PULSE ON DRINKING HALF A PINT OF IT MAY BE ASCRIBED MORE TO THE QUANTITY RECEIVED INTO THE STOMACH THAN TO THE HEATING QUALITY OF THE WATER THE BRISTOL AND MATLOCK WATERS APPEAR TO RESEM BLE EACH OTHER BOTH IN THEIR CHEMICAL AND MEDICI NAL QUALITIES I HAVE EXAMINED AND COMPARED THEM TOGETHER BY THE TEST MENTIONED ABOVE AND SO FAR AS SUCH TRIALS MAY BE BE DEEMED CONCLUSIVE THERE SEEMS TO BE NO OTHER THAN THE FOLLOWING SLIGHT DIF FERENCE BETWEEN THEM BRISTOL WATER BECOMES A LITTLE MORE MILKY ON THE ADDITION OF A SOLUTION OF FIXED ALKALI AND OF SACCHA RUM SATURNI THAN THAT OF MATLOCK THE FORMER ALSO WEIGHS NEAR A GRAIN IN A PINT HEAVIER THAN THE LATTER IS IT NOT TO BE LAMENTED THEREFORE THAT SO LITTLE AT TENTION IS PAID TO MATLOCK EVEN BY THE PHYSICIANS WHO RESIDE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF IT IN HECTIC CASES HAEMOPTOES THE DIABETES AND OTHER DISORDERS IN WHICH THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IS RAPID AND IRREGULAR I SHOULD APPREHEND THAT MATLOCK WATER ON SOME ACCOUNTS CLAIMS THE PREFERENCE TO THAT OF BRISTOL FOR IT IS LESS DISPOSED TO QUICKEN THE PULSE AND MAY THEREFORE BE DRUNK IN LARGER QUANTITIES BUT IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE CLIMATE OF BRISTOL IS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF MATLOCK A CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE TO CONSUMPTIVE PATIENTS SITUATED IN A DEEP THOUGH DELIGHTFUL VALLEY AND SUR ROUNDED BY VERY HIGH MOUNTAINS THE SUN DISAPPEARS 1 AT464 AT MATLOCK EARLIER IN THE EVENINGS THE FOGS ARE LONGER IN DISPERSING AND IT MAY BE PRESUMED THAT RAIN FALLS HERE MORE FREQUENTLY AND COPIOUSLY THAN IN OTHER PLACES FOR AT CATSWORTH WHICH IS EN

EXGOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATION FOR THE PREVENTION OF CHILD LABOR MEETS THE SAME DIFFICULTY THE PRESIDENT HAS ENCOUNTERED IN HIS DESIRE TO SECURE EQUITA BLE REGULATION OF CORPORATIONS THE UNITED STATES THOUGH REALLY A NATION IS LEGALLY STILL A FEDERATION IT IS CONSEQUENTLY QUITE POS SIBLE FOR THOSE NOT IN SYMPATHY WITH SQUARE DEALING PROGRESS AND HUMANITY IF BARRED FROM EVILDOING BY THE LAWS OF ONE STATE TO SECURE IMMUNITY UNDER THE LAWS OF ANOTHER PRESIDENT TAFT IS RIGHT IN GOING BEYOND MERE UNIFORMITY OF LAWS IN REGARD TO GREAT CORPORATIONS AND SEEKING TO MAKE ONE LAW A NATIONAL LAW TO GOVERN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION BOTH THE INCORPORATION AND THE REGULATION OF THESE GREAT ORGANIZATIONS WHY STOP WITH CORPORATION LAW WE HAVE NATIONAL LAW REGU LATING THE DISTILLING OF INTOXICANTS NATIONAL LAW REGULATING ALL BANKS OF ISSUE NATIONAL LAW REGULATING THE OPERATION OF THE SOCALLED TRUSTS NATIONAL LAW REGULATING THE SETTLEMENT OF BANKRUPTS NATIONAL LAW INSUFFICIENT AND TOO FEEBLY ENFORCED WE OF MASSACHUSETTS THINK THAT IS SUPPOSED TO SECURE PURE FOOD WHY SHOULD NOT THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY OF LAW BE CAR RIED FURTHER IN ALL MATTERS OF NATIONAL MOMENT IT IS BETTER TO VIOLATE A SHADOWY STATE RIGHT THAN TO CONSENT TO A SUBSTANTIAL NATIONAL WRONG WE ARE READY IF NEED BE TO DIE IN WAR UNDER ONE COM MON NATIONAL FLAG WHY SHOULD WE SHRINK FROM LIVING IN PEACE UNDER ONE COMMON NATIONAL LAW  NATIONAL CHILD LABOR LAW NEEDED THE BOAST OF AMERICA IS ITS PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHY SHOULD SCHOOLS BE BUILT IF THE CHILDREN ARE PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING THE STATES WITH STERN RESTRICTION OF CHILD LABOR HAVE SEEN THEIR INDUSTRIES CHECKED AND THEIR CAPITAL GO TO DEVELOP INDUSTRIES IN STATES WHERE ANARCHY IS BRED IN THE COAL BREAKER AND THE COTTON MILL WHERE BRAIN AND BODY ARE DWARFED AND STUNTED IN LITTLE CHILDREN CITIZENS IN THE MAK 1SEE APPENDIX ACCOUNT OF LEGISLATIVE HEARING FOR EIGHTHOUR BILL AND PROHIBITION OF NIGHT WORK 7THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ING WHOSE TOILING HANDS ARE SCARCELY LARGE ENOUGH TO SWING A BALL BAT OR CAGE A BUTTERFLY WHY SHOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR ANY STATE TO OFFER EXTRA DIVIDENDS TO CAPITAL BY PERMITTING THE KIND OF LABOR THAT STRIKES AT THE VERY ROOT OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP BY DWARFING THE BRAINS AS WELL AS THE BODIES OF FUTURE AMERICAN CITIZENS WE MUST ULTIMATELY STAND UP NOT AS MEN OF ONE STATE OR OF ANOTHER STATE BUT AS AMERICANS AGAINST THIS INHUMANE THIS INHUMAN LINE OF CLEAVAGE BETWEEN THE STATES NATIONAL LAW MUST ULTIMATELY TAKE THE CHILDREN FROM THE MILLS AND MINES AND PUT THEM IN THE SCHOOLS NOT IN ONE BUT IN EVERY STATE IN THE UNION THE PREPARATION AND ENACTMENT OF A NATIONAL LAW IS HOWEVER A CAMPAIGN OF YEARS MEANTIME HERE AND NOW IT IS OBVIOUSLY OUR DUTY TO ADVANCE TOWARD WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE COURAGE TO RECOG NIZE AS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL BY SECURING UNIFORMITY OF STATE LEGISLATION SUCH UNIFORMITY OF COURSE SHOULD BE A PROCESS OF LEVELING UP NOT OF LEVELING DOWN MASSACHUSETTS NO LONGER LEADS HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS I REGRET TO SAY IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO ADVANCE AS FAST AS WE SHOULD HAVE ADVANCED EVERY YEAR WE ARE NOW OBLIGED TO FIGHT IN THE LEGISLATURE EVEN TO RETAIN SUCH MEASURE OF PROTECTION FOR THE CHILDREN AS WE HAVE EVERY YEAR UNDER THE GUISE OF PHILANTHROPY THE THEATRICAL MANAGERS JOIN HANDS WITH CER TAIN MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY IN A CONSTANT PRESSURE THAT LITTLE GIRLS OF TENDER AGE BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE PROTECTION OF OUR CHILD LABOR LAWS AND PUT UPON THE PROFESSIONAL STAGE FOR THE DAILY STRAIN OF WORK AT NIGHT AMID THE SURROUNDINGS OF MOCK PRIZE FIGHTS AND AMAZON MARCHES HITHERTO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEFEAT THIS PRES SURE THE MODERN CHILD BECOMES SOPHISTICATED SOON ENOUGH HEAVEN KNOWS NEITHER MORAL MENTAL NOR PHYSICAL HEALTH CAN BE PROMOTED BY THE PARTICIPATION OF LITTLE CHILDREN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT IN THE WORK OF THE CORPS DE BALLET THE LITTLE GIRLS PLACE AFTER DARK IS NOT IN THE UNHEALTHY EXCITEMENT OF WORK BEFORE THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT IN THE QUIET RESTFULNESS OF HOME AND A MOTHERS ARMS FIVE NEW LAWS FOR MASSACHUSETTS WE ARE NOT CONTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE DONE WE ARE NOT CON TENT WITH PREVENTING BAD LEGISLATION IN MASSACHUSETTS WE HOPE TO 8CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION IN MASSACHUSETTS ENACT MORE GOOD LEGISLATION WE WISH MASSACHUSETTS NOT MERELY TO LEAD IN SOME THINGS BUT TO LEAD IN ALL THINGS THAT MAKE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE CHILD FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE HOME THIS IS A GOVERNMENT OF PUBLIC OPINION TO SUCCEED IT MUST BE A GOVERNMENT OF INTELLIGENT PUBLIC OPINION INTELLIGENT PUBLIC OPINION CANNOT BE CREATED IF WE PERMIT CHILDREN TO GROW UP WITH STUNTED MINDS OR STUNTED BODIES THE CRUSADE FOR THE CHILDREN HAS PROGRESSED SO RAPIDLY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT MASSACHUSETTS MUST ACT AND ACT NOW IF SHE WOULD RECOVER THE LEADERSHIP WHICH SHE NOW NO LONGER HOLDS IN THIS GREAT REFORM NEW YORK NEW JERSEY AND THE CENTRAL WEST HAVE IN THE LAST THREE YEARS OUTSTRIPPED EVEN MASSACHUSETTS IN THE CARE OF THE CHIL DREN AND FAR OUTSTRIPPED THE REST OF NEW ENGLAND WHICH AS A SECTION IS DESCENDING LOWER AND LOWER IN THE SCALE AS OTHER SECTIONS ADVANCE TO THE END OF RESTORING TO MASSACHUSETTS HER LOST LEADERSHIP FIVE SPECIFIC REFORMS HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE SHORTER HOURS I SHORTER HOURS FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE IN SPITE OF THE RECENT LAW REDUCING THE LEGAL NUMBER OF HOURS A WEEK FOR FACTORY LABOR IT IS STILL POSSIBLE TO WORK A CHILD FOR TEN HOURS IN ANY ONE DAY IN ANY MASSACHUSETTS FACTORY THIS IS NOT THE VARIED WORK OF A COLLEGE PROFESSOR OR OF A CLERGYMAN NOR THE INTERESTING WORK OF A SCULPTOR OR AN ARTIST BUT THE DREARY MONOTONOUS FEEDING OF MACHINES WISCONSIN COLORADO CALIFORNIA DELAWARE IDAHO MISSOURI NEW JERSEY TOGETHER WITH OKLAHOMA OHIO ILLINOIS NEBRASKA AND NEW YORK ALL HAVE A SHORTER WORKING DAY FOR CHILDREN THAN MASSACHUSETTS THE LAST FIVE STATES RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF WORKING HOURS RIGIDLY TO NOT OVER EIGHT HOURS A DAY TO THE OBJECTION THAT SHORTER HOURS FOR CHILDREN MEAN NECESSARILY SHORTER HOURS FOR ADULTS ALSO THE EXPERIENCE OF OHIO SHOWS THAT THIS OBJECTION CAN BE MET BY HIRING TWO SHIFTS OF CHILDREN IF THEY MUST BE HIRED AT ALL WHO DIVIDE THE LONG WORKING DAY BETWEEN THEM 9THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY NO NIGHT WORK 2 NO NIGHT WORK FOR CHILDREN IN 1907 MASSACHUSETTS ENACTED A LAW PROHIBITING ANY MINOR UNDER EIGHTEEN OR ANY WOMAN FROM WORKING BEFORE SIX OCLOCK IN THE MORNING OR AFTER SIX OCLOCK IN THE EVENING IN TEXTILE FACTORIES THIS WAS A WISE LAW IT SHOULD BE EXTENDED WHY SHOULD NOT THE SAME PROHIBITION OF NIGHT WORK BY CHILDREN IN TEXTILE FAC TORIES BE EXTENDED TO CHILDREN IN ALL EMPLOYMENTS NIGHT WORK OF ANY KIND IS EXHAUSTING ENOUGH TO MEN IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNFIT FOR CHILDREN EXISTING LAW IN MASSACHUSETTS EXCEPT AS TO TEXTILE FAC TORIES IN THIS RESPECT LAGS BEHIND THAT IN OHIO NEW YORK OREGON WISCONSIN MICHIGAN ILLINOIS KENTUCKY MINNESOTA MISSOURI NEW JERSEY NEBRASKA AND RHODE ISLAND MEDICAL CERTIFICATES URGED 3 CHILDREN IN UNSOUND HEALTH SHOULD BE BARRED FROM WORK THAT WILL PREVENT THEIR RECOVERY IN 1906 AND I908 STATUTES WERE ENACTED BY MASSACHUSETTS IN SISTING UPON MEDICAL INSPECTION FOR ALL CHILDREN IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF MASSACHUSETTS THIS STATUTE NEEDS AMENDMENT AS ITS PROVISIONS ARE EVADED AND NOT ENFORCED BY MANY OF OUR CITIES AND TOWNS THE MACHINERY FOR SUCH INSPECTION HOWEVER DOES EXIST THE SCHOOL DEPARTMENTS NOW ISSUE AGE AND SCHOOLING CERTIFICATES FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FOURTEEN AND SIXTEEN YEARS WHO WISH TO WORK IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY SIMPLE LO ISSUE TO THE SAME CHILD AT THE SAME TIME A HEALTH CERTIFICATE FROM THE PHYSICIAN ALREADY ASSIGNED TO THE SCHOOL SUCH CERTIFICATE SHOULD BE USED AS THE AGE CERTIFICATE IS USED THAT TENDENCY TO TUBERCULOSIS HEART DISEASE OR AFFECTIONS OF THE EYES OR SPINE MAY NOT BE CONVERTED INTO CHRONIC DISEASE BY PREMATURE EMPLOYMENT A SECOND TEST OF HEALTH SHOULD BE MADE BY THE STATE HEALTH EXAMINERS WHEN THE MINOR APPLIES AT THE FACTORY FOR WORK SOME DISEASES NOT NECESSARILY A BAR TO ALL WORK SHOULD EFFECTUALLY PREVENT EMPLOYMENT AT SOME PARTICULAR WORK A CHILD WITH WEAK LUNGS WHO MAY BE KILLED BY EMPLOYMENT IN A COTTON MILL MAY BE POSI TIVELY BENEFITED BY REGULAR PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR DANGEROUS TRADES BARRED 4 THE OCCUPATION OF CHILDREN IN POSITIVELY DANGEROUS TRADES OR PROCESSES OF TRADES SHOULD BE PROHIBITED IOCHILD LABOR LEGISLATION IN MASSACHUSETTS IN I907 A STATUTE WAS ENACTED IN MASSACHUSETTS PROVIDING FOR THE DIVIDING OF THE COMMONWEALTH INTO FIFTEEN HEALTH DISTRICTS IN WHICH FIFTEEN HEALTH INSPECTORS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR SHOULD INSPECT NOT MERELY GENERAL SANITARY CONDITIONS BUT THE ACTUAL CONDI TIONS OF HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY OF THOSE WORKING IN FACTORIES THEIR REPORTS HAVE BEEN MOST VALUABLE AND HAVE ALREADY LED TO MUCHNEEDED REFORMS THE INSPECTORS HAVE DISCOVERED AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT CERTAIN TRADES DAMAGING TO ALL HEALTH ARE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS IF NOT DEADLY TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT ATTAINED THE STRENGTH OF ADULT AGE ALL THE HEALTH INSPECTORS CAN DO AT PRESENT IS TO REPORT AND RECOMMEND THEY HAVE NO POWER TO REMOVE CHILDREN FROM UN WHOLESOME WORK THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH SHOULD BE GIVEN AUTHORITY TO DESCRIBE WHICH OCCUPATIONS OR PROCESSES OF MANUFACTURE ARE PECULIARLY DANGEROUS TO MINORS THE HEALTH INSPECTORS WORKING UNDER ITS CONTROL SHOULD BE GIVEN AUTHORITY TO REMOVE CHILDREN EN GAGED IN SUCH OCCUPATIONS OR TO TRANSFER THEM TO SOME OTHER PROCESS IN THE SAME OCCUPATION THAT MAY NOT BE SIMILARLY DANGEROUS THERE IS AT PRESENT IN MASSACHUSETTS A VAGUE PROHIBITION OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN IN OCCUPATIONS DANGEROUS TO HEALTH AND MORALS THE EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN IS PROHIBITED UNDER CERTAIN CIR CUMSTANCES IN THE MANUFACTURE OF ACIDS BOTH THESE LAWS ARE A DEAD LETTER MASSACHUSETTS HAS A CHANCE TO LEAD THE UNION BY THE PREPARA TION SCIENTIFICALLY OF A BLACKLIST OF DANGEROUS PROCESSES MOST LISTS HITHERTO PREPARED ARE UTTERLY UNSCIENTIFIC THERE SHOULD BE A DIS TINCTION BETWEEN INDUSTRIES WHERE ALL WORK IS UNDERTAKEN AT THE RISK OF THE WORKER AND INDUSTRIES WHERE ONLY CERTAIN PROCESSES ARE A MENACE TO HEALTH IN SOME FORMS OF MANUFACTURE ALL PROCESSES EXCEPT PACKING AND SHIPPING ARE DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHOSE IMMATURITY MAKES THEM LESS ABLE TO RESIST UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS SUCH AN INDUSTRY IS THE MANUFACTURE OF PEARL SHELL AS DR HANSON OF THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE BOARD OF HEALTH HAS RECENTLY SHOWN EVEN WITH THE MOST APPROVED PROCESSES OF MANUFACTURE EMPLOYEES IN THE PEARL INDUSTRY ARE ALWAYS SUBJECTED TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DUST WHICH BEING A NONMETALLIC MINERAL DUST NOT ONLY IRRITATES THE THROAT AND TRACHEA CAUSING ONE TO COUGH AND TO CLEAR THE THROAT BY IITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EXPELLING MUCUS WITH DUST BUT MAY OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS EXTEND ITS ACTION TO THE LUNGS AND GIVE RISE TO SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND OTHER SYMPTOMS OF DUSTDISEASED LUNGS OR OF TUBERCULAR COMPLICA TION FOR THIS REASON IT IS NONE TOO RADICAL A STEP TO BRING SUCH PRESSURE TO BEAR UPON THE MANUFACTURER OF MOTHEROFPEARL GOODS AS WILL PREVENT THE EMPLOYMENT OF EITHER BOYS OR GIRLS UNDER EIGHT EEN YEARS OF AGE ON THE OTHER HAND RUBBER FACTORIES SHOULD NOT BE ENTIRELY BANNED FROM THE EMPLOYMENT OF MINORS BUT ONLY THE PARTICULAR PROCESSES IN THOSE FACTORIES SUCH AS RUBBER CEMENT WORK WHERE THE CONSTANT INHALATION OF TOXIC NAPHTHA FUMES ALWAYS UNWHOLESOME IS PARTICULARLY DEADLY IN ITS EFFECT ON THE UNDEVELOPED NERVES AND ORGANS OF THE YOUNG WHAT IS NEEDED IS A CLEANCUT SPECIFIC LIST OF PROCESSES AND OF MANUFACTURES PREPARED BY MEDICAL EXPERTS FROM WHICH ALL MINORS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED MOREOVER POWER SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE HEALTH INSPECTORS FOR SUMMARY ACTION ON THE SPOT WHEN CHILDREN ARE FOUND SO EMPLOYED ILLINOIS KENTUCKY MINNESOTA MISSOURI OHIO AND WISCONSIN HAVE SUCH LAWS WHY NOT MASSACHUSETTS STREET CHILDREN NEED PROTECTION 5 THE SOCALLED BOSTON REGULATIONS IN REGARD TO CHILDREN EM PLOYED IN STREET TRADES SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED AND ENLARGED THE MASSACHUSETTS LAW OF I902 AMENDED AND ENLARGED IN I906 IN WHICH THE POWERS TO REGULATE AND LICENSE THE MORE YOUTHFUL STREET PEDDLERS IS VESTED IN THE SCHOOL COMMITTEES OF CITIES HAS WORKED ADMIRABLY IN BOSTON WHERE IT WAS FIRST TRIED MOST OTHER CITIES HOWEVER HAVE NOT ADOPTED IT THE ACT BEING PERMISSORY IT SHOULD BE A MANDATORY ACT ON ALL COMMUNITIES OF ANY SIZE MORE OVER THE PENALTY FOR VIOLATION OF THE ACT NOW FALLS ON THE CHILD THE PENALTY SHOULD BE MADE TO FALL ALSO ON THE PERSON WHO SENDS HIM TO WORK OR THE PERSON WHO SUPPLIES HIM WITH HIS WARES THE SOCALLED BOSTON LAW ENACTED BY MASSACHUSETTS FOR STREET CHILDREN HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE THE BEST AND MOST WORKABLE OF ANY YET DEVISED IN THIS RESPECT MASSACHUSETTS STILL LEADS WE HAVE MADE BEGINNINGS BY NATIONAL LAW TO REMOVE THE ABUSE OF CHILD LABOR FOR THE WHOLE UNITED STATES LET US HELP THE CAUSE BY ATTENDING TO OUR OWN FRONT YARD AND MAKE MASSACHUSETTS A HAPPIER HOME FOR THE CHILDREN 12

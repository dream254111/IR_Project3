essentially the same as involved in the Fisher and Mugge cases was examined and denied German Alliance Insurance Co v Home Water Supply Co Nov I909 174 Fed 764 The court considers the Fisher case and concludes that the observations of Mr Justice BREWER were unnecessary to the decision of the matter then be fore the court the only point in issue being the nature of the judgment of the North Carolina court which being found to have been based on the tort any examination into the merits of the case presented to the state court wa beyond the point and the conclusions of the court thereon dicta On the matter of the water company being engaged in a public calling the court after an examination of the authorities concludes that it was not The opinion of the court is not convincing and it is to be hoped that the supreme court may consent to bring the case up on certiorari thus settling authoritatively at least so far as the federal courts are concerned this important and interesting question For a further discussion of the matter see 5 MICH L REV 362 R W A JUDGMENTS AS CONTRACTS AND THE EFFECT OF MOTIVE IN CREATING A TORT Two unrelated but interesting questions were raised in a recent Wisconsinr case One of these is a question which for years has caused much confusionr and difficulty in the law of torts i e can a bad motive make an act tortious the other may a judgment be regarded as a contract is an equally troublesome question in contract law Defendant the owner of certain real estate made a land contract with plaintiff A decree or judgment of strict foreclosure of this contract was entered providing that the plaintiff might redeem by paying to defendant on or before a certain day the sum of 60000 Prior to the day named in the decree plaintiff repeatedly attempted to pay the said sum to the defendant but was unable to do so because the defend ant willfully avoided plaintiff with the intention of preventing plaintiff from saving his rights under the terms of the foreclosure and the plaintiffs right of redemption was therefore forfeited Plaintiff having made an agreement with a third person for the sale of the said prop erty for 70000 was prevented by defendants acts from fulfilling his part of the agreement and thereby lost the profits of said sale and suffered other damage for all of which he brought suit against the defendant attempting to state an action in tort Defendant demurred to plaintiffs complaint Loehr v Dickson 19IO  Wis  124 N W 293 The court first addressed itself to the question in the law of torts and held that the complaint stated no cause of action in tort as defendants acts were entirely lawful in and of themselves and the presence of a malicious motive for doing them did not make them actionable The court undoubtedly reached a proper result here but the statement of principle as is true in so many cases of this kind is misleading In the course of his opinion Judge DODGE states the principle that the presence of mere malice or motive to injure does not impose liability for a lawful act This principle would cause no difficulty if applied in cases only where the acts are done in exercise of an absolute right Some few rights are of this sort but the vast number are not absolute 486NOTE AND COMMENT and where this is true and the exercise of such a right as is not absolute causes injury to another the motive of the inflictor affects indeed determines the right to recover If the motive for the exercise of the right is good i e is reasonable the defendant is not liable to the person damaged but if the motive for the act is bad and hence unreasonable as for example where the sole purpose of the act is to injure another then the person injured may recover In cases where the right the exercise of which injured another is not absolute the principle stated in the case reviewed is certain to be mis leading Tuttle v Buck I909 Io7 Minn 145 Plant v Woods I900 I76 Mass 492 499 see article on The Influence of Social and Economical Ideals on the Law of Malicious Torts 8 MICH L REV 468 The principal case is irt accord however with the other Wisconsin cases on the same subject The Wisconsin court has gone farther than any other court in maintaining the principle stated and has even held that the owner of land on which there is an artesian well may allow this well to flow continuously and the water to waste even though the flow of his neighbors well is thereby seriously dimin ished and though the defendants intent was to injure his neighbor In order to reach this result it was necessary for the court to declare unconstitutional a state statute making the owner of an artesian well liable to the owners of wells in the same district for the damage which they should sustain because of his allowing his well to discharge more water than was reasonably necessary for his use Huber v Merkel I903 II7 Wis 355 See also Metzger v Hoch rein I90oo 107 Wis 267 One can scarcely understand why the attorneys for the plaintiff in the principal case conceived their action to be in tort unless they allowed their desire to recover as damages the profits lost on the pro posed sale of the property to obscure their judgment as to the sufficiency of such acts to constitute a cause of action in tort The court Judges KERWIN and TIMLIN dissenting decided that the plaintiffs complaint did state a cause of action in contract In reaching this conclusion the court reasoned as follows where one enters into a contract which invests a right in or imposes a duty on the other party one of the implied terms of the contract is that the first party will do nothing to prevent the second party from enjoying that right or performing that duty that a judgment is a contract therefore the judgment or decree of foreclosure pro viding for a redemption by the payment of a certain sum imposed a con tractual duty on the defendant to do nothing to defeat plaintiffs payment of that sum arnd defendants willful avoidance of the plaintiff having caused a breach of this duty plaintiff was entitled to recover proper damages from the defendant In other words the court allowed the plaintiff to treat the decree or judgment as a contract and sue for damages for a breach of its terms It is a general rule of contract law that if one party to a contract by his conduct prevents another from performing his part the party so hindered is excused from a strict performance United States v Peck I880 oz2 U S 64 Williams v United States Bank I829 2 Pet 96 Eliot National Bank v Beal et al I886 141 Mass 566 But conceding this to be the law should a judgment be regarded as a contract so that a suit for damages for 487MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW breach may be brought thereon It is true that a judgment has been held to be a contract in some cases Johnson  Stevens v Butler 1856 2 Ia 535 Childs v Harris Mfg Co 1887 68 Wis 231 Sawyer v Vilas 1846 I9 Vt 43 Sprott v Reid 1852 3 G Greene Ia 489 in the majority of these cases the question decided was whether a judgment was a contract within the meaning of statutes which manifestly intended to divide all causes of action into two broad classes actions on contract and actions on tort It would be generally conceded that if the field of actions were to be so divided judg ments would fall into the contract rather than the tort class and one would ascribe no other idea than that to the legislators since judgments have generally been classified as one species of contracts of record Nearly all of the cases have refused to recognize judgments as contracts where this broad division is not clearly intended as for instance in cases where the ques tion of the unconstitutionality of a law as impairing the obligation of contract is raised Morley v Lake Shore  M S Ry Co I892 146 U S 162 OBrien v Young 1884 95 N Y 428 Jordan v Robinson I838 15 Me 167 Masterson v Gibson 1876 56 Ala 56 Wolffe v Eberlein 1883 74 Ala 99Larrabee v Baldwin i868 35 Cal 155 Wyoming National Bank v Brown 1898 7 Wyo 494 Gaffney v Jones 1905 39 Wash 587 8I Pac 1058 Sheehan  Loler Transp Co v Sims 1887 28 Mo App 64 There seem to be no cases which have gone so far in regarding a judgment as a contract as to allow an action for damages for failure to satisfy it In this respect the principal case is at least novel and likely erroneous G S INTERVENING AGENCY AS AN ELEMENT IN DETERMINING PROXIMATE CAUSE In the law of negligence probably no subdivision is of greater importance than that of proximate cause and incidentally the elements affecting and con stituting it The case of Scott v Shepherd 2 W B1 892 famous as the Squib Case and often cited is a very early case on the effect of an intervening act on proximate cause having been decided in the reign of George III but this case was decided on the theory of natural and probable result rather than on the point of intervening agency In the recent decision of the supreme court of Illinois in the case of Seith v Commonwealth Electric Co 1909  Ill  89 N E 425 there is an extensive discussion of the effect on proximate cause of an intervening agency the facts of the case being that a live electric light wire broke and fell into the street where it lay between the sidewalk and the roadway and as the plaintiff was passing a policeman struck the wire with his club and threw it against the plaintiff who received therefrom a severe shock which caused the injuries alleged It was held VICKERS and CARTER JJ dissenting that the act of the policeman in striking the wire with his club was an inde pendent act which the defendant was not bound to foresee and that this and not the original negligence was the proximate cause of the injury It is altogether probable that no two accidents ever happen in exactly the same way and the courts generally determine cases involving proximate cause 488

INQUISITIVE DR WILLIAM COLE TO THE RSOCIETY,I206876,A DISCOURSE CONCERNING THE SPIRAL INSTEAD OF THE SUPPOSED ANNULAR STRUCTURE OF THE FIBRES OF THE INTESTINS DISCOVERD AND SHEWN BY THE LEARND AND INQUISITIVE DR WILLIAM COLE TO THE R SOCIETY DISCOURSING NEAR TWO YEARS SINCE WITH A VERY INGENIOUS PER SON CONCERNING THE MECHANICAL REASON OF THE PERISTALTICK MOTION OF THE INTESTINES WHICH IS BY ANATOMISTS DEDUCED PRINCI PALLY FROM ANNULAR FIBRES CONSTITUTINGACCORDING TO THE RECEIVED DOCTRINEWITH THE RIGHT FIBRES IMMEDIATELY INVESTING THEMTHOUGH BY THE BY I TAKE THESE TO MAKE A DISTINCT COAT ONE OF THE COATS OF THEM HIS SENCE WAS WHICH HE TOLD ME WAS THAT LIKEWISE OF SOME OTHERS OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE THAT THEY MIGHT BE RATHER NUMEROUS THOUGH SMALL SPHINCTERMUSCLES THAN SINGLE FIBRES TO WHICH THAT MOTION IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED MUSCLES BEING IN MOST IF NOT ALL OTHER INSTANCES OWNED TO BE THE ADEQUATE INSTRUMENTS OF MOTIONS ANALO GOUS TO THIS AND FIBRES THOUGH ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY YET BEING NO OTHERWISE SO THAN AS A NUMBER OF THEM BEING COLLECTED AND FITLY DISPOSED THEY CONSTITUTE A MUSCLE THE CONJECTURE SEEMED TO ME MORE PROBABLE THAN THE VULGARLY RECEIVED604 RECEIVED OPINION BUT YET WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE ABETTORS OF EITHER SEVERAL DIFFICULTIES OCCURRED TO ME WHETHER OF THE TWO SUPPOSITIONS SOEVER WERE ALLOWED FOR FIRST I CONCEIVED IT MIGHT BE DOUBTED EACH OF THESE WHE THER SINGLE FIBRES OR MUSCLES BEING SUPPOSED DISTINCT AS I THINK THEY GENERALLY ARE AND IF ANNULAR I CONCEIVE MUST BE HOW THE ACTUATING MATTER OR IMPRESSION ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF SOME LEARNED MEN SHOULD BE TRANSMITTED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER DOWN ALONG THE WHOLE TRACT OF THE INTESTINES SINCE NATURES USUAL WAYFOR THE PROPAGATION OF ANIMAL MOTION IS BY A CONTINUATION OF VESSELS OR AT LEAST FIBRES WHETHER THEY BE CONCAVE OR NOT FROM THE PART WHERE IT BEGINS TO THAT TO WHICH TIS IMPARTED EITHER FOR THE CON VEYANCE OF SOME ACTUATING SUBSTANCE OR ACCORDING TO THE OTHER HYPOTHESIS THE COMMUNICATING AN IMPRESSION BUT THERE BEING IN THE ANNULAR SUPPOSITION NO SUCH CONTINUATION OF VESSELS OR FI BRES A LATERAL CONTIGUITY BEING ALL THAT CAN BE PRETENDED IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE URGEDTHAT THE INFLUENT AND MOVING MATTER ACCORDING TO THAT NOTION MIGHT BE TRANSMITTED BY MUTUAL INOSCULATIONS BE TWEEN THE CONTIGUOUS FIBRES ALONG THEIR SIDES WHICH IF THERE BE NO COMMUNICATION BY VESSELS WAS THE ONLY WAYI COULD GHESS AT TO SOLVE THE DOUBT FORTHE NOTION OF AN IMPRESSION WOULD HARDLY DO THE BUSINESS SINCE IT SEEMED NOT EVIDENTTHAT THERE COULD BEIN THAT SUPPOSITION OF A CONTINUITY OF FIBRES TENSITY ENOUGH IN THE INTESTINS TO CARRY ON SUCH A MOTION BUT TO THIS I CONSIDERED SECONDLY THAT SUCH A SUPPOSITION SEEMED NOT VERY AGREEABLE TO NATURES METHODS WHICH ORDINARILY MAKES USE OF VESSELS AND THOSE BOTH CLOSE AND AS DIRECT AS THE DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION OF THE PART WILL BEAR FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF THE FLUID SUBSTANCES IN THE BODIES OF ANIMALS NOT LATERAL EMISSARIES EXCEPT WHERE SOME GREAT INCONVENIENCE IS DESIGNED TO BE PREVENTED BY THE HELP OF SUCH CONVEYANCES AS FOR INSTANCE BY THE ANASTOMOSESDISCOVER ED TO BE BETWEEN VEINS AND VEINS ARTERIES AND ARTERIES IN WHICH VESSELS THE BLOUD RUNNING WITH A LARGE AND RAPID STREAM SHOULD ANY OF THEM CHANCE TO BE OBSTRUCTED THE CIRCULATION SO NECESSARY TO LIFEMUST NEEDS BE INTERCEPTED WITHOUT SOME LATERAL CONVEYANCE OF IT INTO OTHERS OF THE SAME KIND WHICH INCONVENIENCE YET I SUPPOSED WOULD HARDLY BE ALLEDGED IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT FA BRICK OF THOSE VESSELS SEEMING TO BE DESIGNED FOR EXTRAORDINARY EMERGENCIESBUT THESE BEINGACCORDING TO THE PRESENT SUPPOSITION THE CONSTANT AND NECESSARY DUCTS OF THIS ACTUATING MATTER BUT NEVERTHELESS THIRDLY605 THIRDLY IT SEEMED DIFFICULT TO ME AT LEAST TO SOLVE THIS INTESTI NAL CONTRACTION THOUGH THESE LATERAL APERTURES WERE SUPPOSED FOR IF FIBRES WHETHER CONSIDERED AS SINGLE OR AS CONSTITUTING A MUSCLE BE CONTRACTED ACCORDING TO THEIR LENGTH FROM SOME INFLU ENT MATTER IT MUST BEACCORDING TO MY SENCE FROM A DISTENSION OF THEM IN BREADTH AND IN ORDER TO THAT THIS MATTER MUST UNDERGO SOME CONSINEMENT IN THE PART TO BE DISTENDED BUT IF THEY HAVE LA TERAL PERFORATIONS AND THOSE IN THE OPPOSITE PART PROPORTIONATE TO THOSE IN THAT WHICH ADMITS THIS MATTER WHICH MUST I CONCEIVE BE GRANTED SINCE THE CONTRACTION IS ALL ALONG THE INTESTINES PROPOR TIONATE HOW CANIT BE SUPPOSED A DISTENSION AT LEAST SUCH A ONE AS IS HERE REQUIRED CAN HAPPEN WHEN THE MATTER DESIGNED TO EFFECT IT HAS SO READY A PASSAGE FORTH ESPECIALLY ITS DETERMINATION FROM THE IMPELLING CAUSE BEING IN RIGHT LINES DOWNWARD IF IT WERE OBJECT ED THAT THE MOTION OF THIS SUBSTANCE MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO BE LA TERAL AS WELL AS DIRECT IN REGARD THERE WOULD BE A PASSAGE FOR IT IN TO THE FIBRES AS WELL AS THROUGH THE ANASTOMOSES AND THAT IN PRO PORTION LARGER THAN THROUGH THESE WHENCE NOTHING SEEMS TO HIN DER BUT THAT A DISTENSION OF THEM MIGHT FOLLOW I SUPPOSED IT MIGHT BE REPLYED THAT BY REASON OF SUCH A DISTORSION OF PART OF THE IMPELLED MATTER IT SEEMS THAT THE IMPRESSED MOTION WOULD BE SOON LOST ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF MOTION UNLESS THE IMPELLING CAUSE WERE MORE VIOLENT THAN I SEE REASON IN THIS CASE TO IMAGINE IT TO BE BUT INDEED I THINK NO ANATOMISTS HAVE OBSERVEDTHAT MUS CLES SUPPOSING THESE SUCH RECEIVE THEIR ACTUATING MATTER IN AT THEIR SIDES OR WHEN THEIR MOTION CEASES SEND IT FORTH THAT WAY BUT ALL SO FAR AS HAS BEEN OBSERVED ARE SENCED WITH A CONSIDERABLY COMPACT AND COMPARATIVELY IMPERVIOUS MEMBRANE FOURTHLY I CONSIDERED THAT ALL MUSCLES ARE OBSERVED TO HAVE TWO TENDONS ONE AT EACH EXTREMITY BY THE APPROACH OF ONE WHEREOF TOWARD THE OTHER ITS MOTION WHICH IS CONTRACTION IS PERFORMED BUT IT SEEMS HARD TO CONCEIVE THAT THESE TENDONS SHOULD COINCIDE AS IN THIS SUPPOSITION THEY MUST AND IF THEY DO I PRESUMED IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT PART OF THESE CIRCULAR MUSCLES IF SUCH THE TENDONS ARE AND WHERE THE MOTION SHOULD BEGIN IN EACHIT BEING OBSERVED THAT ALL MUSCLES ARE SASTNED TO SOME EITHER SIMPLY OR COMPARATIVELY UNMOVABLE PART TOWARD WHICH ORDINARILY THEY MOVE AND BY WHICH THE INSTINCT OF MOTI ON IS FROM THE NERVES CONVEYED TO THEM BUT NO ANATOMISTS SO FAR AS I HAD OBSERVED HAVING DISCOVERED THAT ANY ONE PART OF THESE606 THESE MUSCLES OR MOVING FIBRES WHICHSOEVER THEY BE HAS ANY STRI CTER COHESION THAN OTHER WITH ANY OF THE ADJACENT PARTS I CONCEI VED I MIGHT BE ALLOWD THE LIBERTY TO DOUBT OF THE HYPOTHESIS ESPE CIALLY IF I COULD SATISFIE MY SELF BETTER BY ANOTHER FOR INSTEAD OF THESE SOLUTIONS THERE OCCURRED TO MY THOUGHTS A THIRD WAY WHICH PROVIDED EXPERIENCE WOULD COUNTENANCE IT SEEMED MORE MECHANICALLY ADJUSTED TO SOLVE THE PHAENOMENON VIZ THAT THOSE FIBRES WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTEEMED ANNULAR MIGHT PER HAPS BE SPIRAL AND SO BE CONTINUED DOWN IN ONE TRACT TO THE LOWEST EXTREMITY OF THE INTESTINES WITHAL THAT THEIR SINALNESS COMPARED WITH THE COMPASS THEY SETCH ABOUT THE INTESTINE MIGHT VERY EASILY I CONCEIVED IMPOSE UPON ANY WHO MADE NOT THOSE REFLECTIONS OR TRIED NOT TO UNRAVEL THEM THEIR DECLINATION BEING FOR THAT REASON NOT EASILY DISCERNIBLE WHICH IF TRUE IT SEEMED PROBABLE TO ME THAT WHEN EITHER A BARE MOTION SHALL BE IMPRESSED ON THEM AT THEIR BEGINNING OR ANY SUBSTANCE IMPELLED INTO THEM THEY BEING TO BE SUPPOSED IN STATU NATURALI MODERATLY TENSE SO LONG AS THE MOVING CAUSE CONTINUES THE MOTION MUST BE SUCCESSIVELY CONTINUED ALL ALONG THEIR TRACTS AND THAT BEING IN AMBITUM MUST THEREFORE WHILST IT LASTS BY ABBREVIATING THESE FIBRES STRAITEN THE INTESTINE AND SO THRUST FORWARD WHAT IS CONTAINED IN IT ESPECIALLY IF THEY PROVED TO HAVE A MUSCULAR FABRICK THE CONJECTURE AS TWAS NOT DISRELISHED BY THE PERSON TO WHOM I PROPOSED IT SO GRATISIED ME THE MORE FOR THE SEEMING EASINESS OF THE PERFORMANCE NATURES OPERATIONS BE ING THE MOST EASY AND SIMPLE THAT CAN BE IMAGINED THOUGH FOR THAT REASON VERY OFTEN I DOUBT OVERLOOKD BUT THE NOTION LAY AFTER WARD LONG DORMANT TILL ABOUT HALF A YEAR SINCE BEING REVIVED BY I KNOW NOT WHAT OCCASION I CONSIDERD TWAS TOO UNPHILOSOPHICAL TO ACQUIESCE IN BARE SPECULATION WHEN AUTOPSY MIGHT BE CONSULTED AND THEREFORE I SET UPON THE EXPERIMENT WHICH I FIRST MADE IN A PORTION IN THE UPPER INTESTINES OF AN OX WHICH BY REASON OF THEIR LARGENESS OF PROPORTION TO THOSE OF MOST OTHER SPECIES OF ANIMALS SEEMD FITTEST FOR THE TRYALAFTERWARDS IN THOSE OF SHEEP AND CALVES BESIDE THE REPETITION OF IT IN OXEN AND NOT ONLY IN THE SMALLER IN TESTINES BUT IN THE COLON AND CAECUM ALSO THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND RESULT OF WHICH TRYALS ARE AS FOLLOWS TO EFFECT A DUE DISJUNCTION OF THE MEMBRANES AND FIBRES WHICH I FOUND TWAS HARD IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO MAKE WHILE TWAS RAW I WAS SAIN TO CAUSE THE INTESTINE OF OXEN TO BE BOILED 5 OR 6 HOURS OF SHEEP 4 WHEREBY THE COMPAGES OF THE PARTS WAS SO LOOSNED607 LOOSNED THAT THE TWO OUTWARD COATS VIZTHE COMMON ONEAND THAT CONSISTING OF RIGHT FIBRES WERE EASILY SEPARATED IF IT WERE ATTEMPTED SOON AFTER IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE WATER FROM THAT TO WHICH MY SEARCH WAS DESTINED AND LEST THOSE REPUTED ANNULAR ONES NAKED THOUGH BY THE WAY TOO LONG COCTION WOULD PROVE PREJUDICIAL ON THE OTHER HAND BY TOO MUCH INTENERATING THE FIBRES THESE AT THE TOP OF THE INTESTINE I ATTEMPTED TO SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER AND WHEN THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN DECURTATED BY THE UNEQUAL CUTTING OF THE KNIFE WERE TAKEN OFF I FOUND FIRST THAT I COULD NOT SEPARATE A SINGLE FIBRE FROM HIS FELLOWS TO ANY CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ALL OF THEM TO MY OBSERVATION BEING VERY SMALL AND IN THE SEPARATION RUNNING SMALLER AND SMALLER AND WITHAL BY REASON OF THEIR IMPLICATION OR STRICTER COHESION ONE WITH ANOTHER EASILY BREAKING BUT A CONGERIES OF THEM TO BE OBSERVED ESPECIALLY THOUGH NOT PRECISELY ALWAIES IN THOSE PLACES WHERE BY GENTLY EXTENDING THE INTESTINES SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN LETTING IT RETURN AGAIN THE COHESION OF THE SEVERAL SERIES OF THEM BECAME LOOS NEDWHICH AT FIRST VIEW WOULD RESEMBLE A PRETTY LARGE FIBRE WOULD WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY RISE TOGETHER THE VERY SMALL CONSTITUTING FIBRES OF WHICH CLUSTERS YET IF THE BOILING HAD BEEN VERY LONG CON TINUED WHEREBY THE COMPAGES WAS VERY MUCH RELAXED WOULD IN THE RAISING BE VERY APT TO SEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER AND APPEAR DI STINCT BY REASON OF THEIR INSERTIONS BY AND BY TO BE MENTIONED SECONDLY THAT WHEN BEGINNING AT THE TOP I ATTEMPTED THE SE PARATION OF ONE OF THESE SUPPOSED ANNULAR CLUSTERS OF FIBRES TO WARDS MY RIGHT HAND ON THAT SIDE OF THE INTESTINE I MEAN WHICH WAS TURNED TOWARDS ME A WHOLE RING WOULD COME OFF TOGETHER EXCEPTING THAT SOME FIBRILLAE WHICH RISING FROM CONTRARY PARTS DECUSSATED ONE ANOTHER AT THE TOP IN THAT PHASIS WOULD A LITTLE RE TAIN IT WHICH AT FIRST STAGGERD ME AS TO MY FOREMENTIONED CONJE CTURE BUT ENDEAVOURING IT TOWARDS MY LEFT I FOUND FOR THE MOST PART I COULD EASILY ENOUGH UNRAVEL THAT CLUSTER TO A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH VIZTHAT OF SOMETIMES MORE THAN TWO OR THREE SPANSBEFORE RUPTION OF THE WHOLE CLUSTER I MEAN WHICH YET AT LAST TWOULD BE SUBJECT TO FOR THIRDLY THOUGH THOSE CONVOLUTIONSAS TO THE GREATEST PART OF THEM APPEARED DISTINCT YET I FOUND THAT FROM EVERY ONE OF THEM AT SHORT DISTANCES SOME FIBRES DID OBLIQUELY AND THE MOST OF THEM TO MY BEST OBSERVATION ACCORDING TO THE COURSE OF THOSE I HAVE MENTIO NED INSERT THEMSELVES INTO THE NEXT CONVOLUTION AND BECOME A PART OF IT THOUGH WITHAL SOME I OBSERVED TO HAVE A CONTRARY TEN K K K K DENCY608 DENCYOR RATHER SEEMD TO ASCEND FROM THE LOWER TO THE UPPER CON VOLUTION AND HELP TO CONSTITUTE IT AND SO TO OBSERVE THE COURSE MENTIONED NAY SOMETIMES WOULD GO FARTHER THAN THE NEXT CONVO LUTION AND RUNNING UNDER IT APPLY THEMSELVES OBLIQUELY TO SOME HIGHER WHICH YET BEING IN A SMALLER NUMBER THAN THE REST THAT LAY IN THE ORDER CONTRARY TO THEM DID NOT VERY MUCH HINDER THE DISSO CIATION OF THE MAIN ONES WHICH FIBRES BREAKING OFF AND THAT IN SOME PLACES IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN IN OTHERS WOULD AT LAST AND THE SOONER IF THE INTESTINE BEGAN TO GROW DRY WHICH TWOULD QUICKLY DO CAUSE THE WHOLE CLUSTER TO BREAK OFF FOURTHLY I OBSERVED THAT AS THE MOST OF THESE FIBRES WOULD BY DEGREES ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF THE CONVOLUTIONS INSERT THEMSELVES INTO THE NEXTSO SOME OF THEM WOULD IN THE SAME ORDER PASS OVER IT AND MORE SO FAR AS I HAVE OBSERVED WOULD RUN UN DER ITAND EITHER ADJOYN THEMSELVES TO SOME MORE REMOTEOR ELUDE MY SEARCHING BY HIDING THEMSELVES UNDER THEM THIS INSERTION OF THESE FIBRES SEEMS TO BE THE REASON OF THE ANNULAR PHASIS THAT I MEN TIONED EVEN NOW IN THE CONTRARY WAY OF SEPARATION FOR THE AT TEMPTING IT CONTRARY TO THEIR ORDER MUST HINDER IN SOME MEASURE THE READY DISSOCIATION OF THE NEXT CONVOLUTIONS UPWARDS ESPECI ALLY NEAR THE SEVERED EXTREMITY WHERE THERE IS LESS RESISTANCE OF THE ADJACENT PARTS THE MENTIONED FIBRES ALSO SEEMING SOMEWHAT BIG GER AND CONSEQUENTLY STRONGER IN THE UPPER THAN AFTER THEIR IN SERTION INTO THE LOWER CONVOLUTION THOUGH INDEED FIFTHLY I FOUNDTHAT IF I BEGAN AT A LOWER PART OF THE INTESTINEAND TRYD TO UNRAVEL UPWARDSTHERE WAS NOT MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY IN SO DOING THAN WHEN BEGINNING ABOVE I ATTEMPTED IT DOWNWARDS OF WHICH THE REASON I SUPPOSEMIGHT BE THE TENDERNESS OF THE PART OC CASIONED BY LONG BOILING WHEREBY I COULD NOT PERHAPS JUDG OF THE DEGREES OF RENITENCY IN THOSE SMALL FIBRES IN THIS CONTRARY WAY OF SEPARATION TOOTHE OPERATIONI OBSERVD WOULD NOT SUCCEED UNLESS I ATTEMPTED IT IN THE CONTRARY ORDERVIZTOWARDS MY RIGHT HAND SIXTHLY WHEN BEFORE BOILING I CAUSED THE INSIDE OF THE INTE STINE TO BE TURNED OUTWARD AS I DID IN TWO TRYALS AND AFTERWARD BY TAKING OFF THE GLANDULOUS AND VASCULAR COATSWHICH I THINK TO BE DISTINCT FROM ONE ANOTHER AS I SAID BEFORE OF THOSE CONSISTING OF RIGHT FIBRES AND THE SUPPOSED ANNULAR ONESENDEAVOURED TO UNRA VEL THE FIBRES I FOUND THEY WOULD COME OFF IN THE CONTRARY ORDER VIZ FROM MY LEFT HAND TOWARD MY RIGHT WHICH I CONCEIVE CON FIRMS THE OBSERVATION ABOVE DELIVERD IN REGARD THE INTESTINE BE ING INVERTED THE ORDER OF SEPARATION MUST BE SO TOO THOUGH I SOUND609 FOUNDOR THOUGHT THE OPERATION MORE DIFFICULT BY REASON OF SOME FIBRES LYING IN THE OPPOSITE ORDER MENTIONED UNDER THE THIRD PAR TICULAR AND IN THIS APPEARANCE LYING UPPERMOST SEVENTHLY IN ONE OF THESE ATTEMPTS OF UNRAVELLING THE FIBRES OF THE INTESTINE OF AN OX SO INVERTED I FOUND THAT THOUGH THE FIBRES I TOOK UP CAME OFF IN THE ORDER I JUST NOW MENTIONED YET RUN NING OVER SOME OTHERS THEY MADE A MORE OBLIQUE EXCURSION AND FOR TWO OR THREE CONVOLUTIONS LEFT BETWIXT THEM A CONSIDERABLE AREA OF FIBRES AMOUNTING ACCORDING TO MY CONJECTURE TO FIVE OR SIX TIMES OR MORE THE BREDTH OF THOSE THAT SO CAME OFF TILL GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER AMONG THE OTHER FIBRES AND AT LAST RUNNING UN DER THEM THEY COULD BE NO LONGER TRACED BUT BRAKE OFF WHETHER THIS BE USUAL OR ONLY LUSES NATURAE I CANNOT DETERMINE EIGHTLY I FOUND IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IN THAT ONE TRYAL I MADE TO UNRAVEL THE FIBRES OF THE CAECUM THAN THE OTHER INTESTINE WHICH SEEMED MORE INTERWOVEN THAN THOSE OF THE REST AND TO HAVE CONTRARY TENDENCIES ONE AMONG ANOTHER THIS IS THE SUM OF MY OBSERVATIONS HITHERTO CONCERNING THIS COAT WHICH I TAKE LEAVE TO THINK ONE CONCAVE AND HELICAL MUSCLEIF I MAY SO STYLE IT AND THAT IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED SUCH THE FORE MENTIONED INSERTIONS SEEMD TO EVIDENCE THEY APPEARING TO ME IN THE SEPARATING APPOSITELY ENOUGH TO REPRESENT THE FABRICK OF A MUSCLE DELIVERED BY THE ACCURATE STENO WHERE THE TENDONS OF IT ARE FIXED IS NOT EVIDENT BUT IF I MAY HAVE THE LIBERTY TO CONJECTURE I SHOULD THINK THE UPPER OF THEM TO BE RADICATED AT LEAST AT THE PYLORUS IF NOT AS HIGH AS THE SPHINCTER GULAE IF THIS BE NOT IT SINCE THE CARNEOUS COAT OF THE STOMACH BEING BY THE LEARNED DR WILLIS FOUND TO BE A MUSCULAR CONTEXTURE AND THERE BEING A CONTINUA TION OF MOTION BETWEEN THAT PART AND THE INTESTINES IT SEEMS TO ME NOT ALTOGETHER IMPROBABLE THEY MAY BE BUT ONE MUSCLE AND THE OTHER AT THE ANUS WHETHER THE SUPPOSED ANNULAR FIBRES OF THE VEINS AND ARTERIES MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME FABRICK AS THOSE OF THE INTESTINES SINCE BOTH THESE KINDS OF VESSELS SEEM TO HAVE A PERISTALTICK CONTRACTION OF THEIR OWN AND NOT TO BE BARE CONDUITPIPES TO TRANSMIT THE IMPELLED BLOUD I PROPOSE TO BE CONSIDERED AND EXAMINED BY PERSONS OF MORE ACUTE HANDS AND JUDGMENTAS I DO ALL WHAT I HAVE HERE DELIVE RED NOT DARING TOO MUCH TO TRUST EVEN THE INFORMATIONS OF MY OWN HANDS AND EYES TILL I FIND THEM CONFIRMED BY THOSE OF OTHERSMORE JUDICIOUS AS WELL AS DEXTROUS IN MAKING EXPERIMENTS K K K K 2 MONSIEUR

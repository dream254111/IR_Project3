were 1 Ocean Carrents on ths XorAhEast Coast of South America By J A MANN Esq FRGS THE eurrent or oeeanstream setting along the northeast eoast of South Ameriea frozn Cape St Roque to the West India Islands known as the Guiana eurrent is supposed to run eontinuously in a north est direetion at a rate varying from 1 to 4 knots per hour In this paper is given an aeeount of a voyage of the brigantine Monte Christo from Cayenne in Ereneh Guiana to Paranahiba in Brazil in July and August 1862 from whieh the author eonsiders that the ellrrent was at that time reversed in a most unmistakeable manner The departure was taken from  Ile la Mer one of the islands known as  Remire  of Caenne on the 26th the wind blowing east with whieh a direet northerly eourse was made until the 30th when the position of the ship was 7 nol th and in the same longitude as Cat enne On this date the wind ehanged to the south and eontinued to blow from that quarter to the ssw until the 7th of August when the ships position by dead reekoning was 42 14 Mr and an Austrian ship that was spoken gave the position as 27 W It was not diseovered until some days after when a seeond ship was spoken that the latter was the aetual position From this it appears that for eight eonseeutive days the Hlonte Christo was drifted at the rate of 4i knots an hour in an ESE direetion diametrieally opposite to the usual flow of the stream Throllghout the remainder of the voyage extendillg over a further period of fourteen days the sanle eurrent was experieneed The eaptain of another ship tho loyal which eame into Paranahiba some days after having a ehronometer on board had abandoned his observations believing his ehronometer to be out of order Also while sailing on board the French manofwar steamer Alecton from Surinam to Cayenne the author met with the same phenomenon leaving little room for doubt that the eurrent was reversed throughout and for a eonsi derable time Mention is made of unusual winds south and ssw at Surinam These eoming up from the Cordilleras were very patent causing influenza and eolds and for some time previous similar complaints had been prevalent throughout the West Indies The PRESIDENT said there was present that distinXuished geographer of the seas Captain Maury who had recently arrived frolll America and who lvas perhaps better acquainted than any other individual with the currents and tiles of the Atlantic Any oleservations he miaht offer upon the subject would be extremely gratifying to the Societyss 1S 1863 REVERSAL OF THE GULFgEAM 1 CAPTAIN MAURY said he had scarcely come prepared to say anything at the Meetill because as they mifflht well imaCine his mind for the last year or two had been occupied with subjects entirely different from ocean currents In fact much to his reCret he had now very little to do with the sea Mr Mann in his interestillffl and philosophical papel set out with a remark that is perfectly correct and which evely physical georrapher who has attempted the study of the ocean has no doubt felt to be painfully truethat these currents were most capricious thints they not only sornetimes Gease to rtm but they occasionally turn alll run backwards lhe Gulfstream is one of the most marked and illteresting phenomena of the sea When he was at Bermuda7 on his way to England from South Carolina he had the pleasure of nzeetinC there the officers of some of Her MaJestys ships who had been cruising on tho North American station for several years One of them told hul as corroborative of what Mr Maml had said that he had bund the Gulfxtream on his passage from Halifax to Berlnuda acttlally runnin to the southward axld westward It struck him as beinr very sinrular The temperature of the water was all ricrht but his leckonina was all wrong So when he went back hs thought he would try it again takinr care to verify his instIuments Sinvllarly enough he found the Gulfstream not runninC in its usual course but runninffl backwards That the Gulfstream is this capricious thinC of creation needed no other evidence than the sinfflularly mild winter nve are 110W enjoying in Great Britain In studying oceancurrents we have to look at what they do in the lont run because there are many exceptional cases The case of the Guiana strealll mentioned by Mr Manll is almost as peculiar a phenomenon as that of the Gulfstream running backwards The current is well known amonCall Brazilian naviaators  and consequently when they wish to sail from Para at the mouth of the Amazoll to Rio de Janeirc they make a stretch to the nolthwald and westnvard until they get up to 25 or 30 N and iIl longi tude 60 therl gettin into the tradewind they go south aCain Thus they dodCe those very currents to which Mr Mann had drawn our attention Since he had been in Entland he had received one of the most valuable con tributiolls to our knowledge of the currents of the Equatorial Atlantic that he had ever seen It was the result of a great deal of patieIlt observation aIld research by Mr Capella the head of thf3 MeteoroloCical ObservatoEy at Lisbon That gentleman has constructed a windchart vf the Equatorial Atlantic between the coast of Africoa and the coast of America he has discussed hundleds of observatioIls and he has established a wellmarked current just on the north of the equator settinffl to the east and another eqalally well markel current just to the south of the equator settiIla to the west At the same time he discussed the force of the wind  and he has found just a little south of the Cape de Verd Islands takin the form of an ellipse a retion in which the northeast tradewind blows with the greatest force  and so in like manner he finds between St Helena and Cape St Roque a reion where as Jallsen had shown the southeast tradeurillds blow with the greatest folce Now if we have so manr exceptions xvith the winds which have so much to do with currents we may well expect to find occasional exceptions in the currents themselves The PRESIDENT in presenting the last letter he had received fronl Dr Livingstone took a brief review of his operations on the Shird river and said that ending the delay of carryinffl his vessel to that river from the Zambesi he had gone northnvards alon the coast of Africa to tbe mouth of the river Rovuma As that river lies to the north of all territories to which the Pvrtu guese lay claile Dr Livin rstone was ansious to ascertain how far  omtnercial enterprise could be establiashed between its mouth arid the countries watered by the Shird He therL read the following letter E 22 LETTER FROM DR LIVINGSTONE Jif 12 1863  River Rovuma Oct 101862  MY DEAR SIR RODERIC1I We have just returned from a months boat exploration of the Rovtlrnt River WVe turned at lon 38 3 E and lat 11 13 s so assurnino the longitude of the anchoraCe to be 40 30 E and lat 10 28 s we went about 114 miles as the crow flies fron the coast Adding our loncritude and latitude tooether we wetlt 156 miles up the river lt was unusually and excessively low and elltailed frequent dragaing of the boats at the crossings Whell the water split up illtO three channcls the work was grievous but having cllosen the dry season when we cannot do tntlch in the Zambesi we put  a stout heart to a stey brae nesTer stopped except Oll Sundays and after 15 days up and 10 down find ourselves rather tired and brown  The bed of the river is about threequarters of a mile wide It is flanked by a wellwooded tablelanl which looks like ranCes of hills 500 feet high Some times the spurs of the hiah land conae close to the water but generally there i a mile of level alluvial soil between them and the bank So few peole aIpeared at first it loolied like a  land to let  but having walked up to the edte of the platelu considerable cultivatiorl was met with thouoh to make a garden a great nlass of brushuTood must be cleared away The wometl anzl children fleel but callillg to a man not to be afraid he asked if I had any objectioll to  liluor with him and brouaht a cup of native beer There are nany llew trees on the slolhes plent of ebony in some places and tlliclSets of brushwooel The whole scenery had a light gray appearance dotted over witl masses of greell trees which precede the others in putting on new foliaOe for this may be called our winter Other trees showed their youtlg leaves brownish red but soon all will be gloriollsly green Fllrther up we came to numerous villages perched on sandbanks in the river They had villacres on shore too and plenty of grain stowed awav in the woods They did IlOt fear for their victulls but were afraid of beinc stoletl themselves We passed througll them all right civilly declinint an illvitation to land at a villaae where two huma heads had been cut off A lot of tllese rivertsilots then followed us till there was only a narrow leassa le under a hirh bank and there let lrive their arrows at us VVe stopped and expostulated with them for a loner time then got theln to one of the boats and exlained to them how easily we coulcl dlive them off with our rifles and revolvers but we wished to be friends and oave about 30 trards of calico in presents in proof of friendship All this time we were withill 40 yards of a lot of them armed with musliets and bows Oll the high batll On paltina as we thought on friendly terms and movina on we received a volley of musketballs alld arrows four bulletholes beinC ulade in my sail but findint that we instead of running axvay returned the firethey took to their heels and left the conviction that these are the Border ruffians ho at various points present olstacles to African explorationmelsstealero ill fact who care no more for human life than that respectable tarty in Londol who stuffed the  Pioneers  lifebuoys with old straw instead of cork lt uas sore against the grain to pay away that calico it was submitting to be robbed for the sake of peace It cannot be called  black mail for that implies the rendering of importal1t services by Arabs nor is it  custorn dues It is rob bery perpetlated by any one who has a traveller or trader in his power and when tamely submitted to increases in amount till wood water grass and every conceivable subject of oSence is made oecasion for a fine On our return we passed quietly throllgh them all and probably the next Entlish boat will be respected Beyond these Makende all were friendly and civil layintr down their arms before they came near IlS Much trade is carried on by means of canoes and we hatl the tompany of seven of these sntall craft for three da s They brint rice and grain down to purchase salt When about 60 miles up the tableland mentioned above retiles and we have an imrnense plain with detached grarlite rocks arld hills dotted over Some rocks therl appear in thezAN 12 1863 CONDITION OF THE ATLANTIC SEABED 3 river and at last at ollr tllrning point the bed is all rocky masses four or five feet high with the water rushinC through by numerous channels The canoes go through with ease and we might have talien the boats llp also but we were told that further up the channels were much narrower and thele vvas S high degree of probability that we should get them smasied in coming down  We were on part of the slaveronte from the Lake Nyassa to Quiloa Kilwa about 30 miles below the station of Ndende where that route crosses Xovuma and a little further from the confluence of the Liende which arising fIom the hills on the east of the Lake Nyassa flows into Rovuma lt is said to be very large with reeds and aquatic plants gmwing in it but at this time only ankledeep It colltains no rocks till near its sources on the mountains anl between it and the lake the distance is reported to require between two and three days At the cataracts where we turned there is no rock on the shole as on the Zambesi at Kebrabasa and Murchisons Cataracts The land is erfectly suooth and as far as we could see the couIltry presented the same flat appearance with only a few detached hills The tsetse is met with all along the Rovuma and the people have no cattle iil consequence They procluce larCe qllantities of oilyielding seeds as the sesame or gerzelin and have hives placezl on the trees es ery few miles We never saw ebony of equal size to 7hat we met on tllis river and as to its navigability as the mark at rhich water stands for many months is three feet above what it is now and it is now said to be a cubit lower than usual I have no doubt that a vessel clrawing whell loaleR about 18 inches would ruIl with ease during many months of the year Should FnClish trade be established on the Lake Nyassa Englishmen will make this their outlet rather than pay dlles to the Portuguese  Bre retllrn to put our ship on Nyassa by the Shird because there we have the friendship of all the people except that of the slavehunters Forrnerly we found the Shire people far more hostile than are the Makonde of I20vllma but now they have confidenee in llS and we in them To leave them nomr would be to open the country for the slavehtlIlters to pursue their calling thelein and we should be obliged to go through the whole process of gaininC a peoples confidence again  It may seem to some persons weak to feel a chord vibratina to the dust of 11er WhO rests on the banks of the Zambesi and thinking that the path thereby is consecrated by her remains We go back to Johanna and Zambesi in a few days Kinl regards to Lady M and believe me ever aSectionately yours

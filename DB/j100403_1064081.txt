property caused by it or by any connecting carrier Act of June 29 1906 c 3591  7 34 Stat at L 584 595 Interest attaches to the decision in the instant case as being the first one in which the United States Supreme Court has passed on the ques tion whether the words loss damage or injury are broad enough to make the initial carrier liable for pecuniary loss to the shipper due to delay occurring on the line of a connecting carrier as well as for that due to damage to or loss of the goods occurring there The decision carries out the purpose of Congress to relieve interstate commerce from the burden of diverse state laws and to secure a unity of responsibility for there is no reason why diversity of laws governing liability for de lay do not cause as much confusion and inconvenience as diversity of laws governing liability for actual loss or damage The state courts in which the question has arisen have almost uniformly held the initial carrier liable for delay as well as for actual damage injury or loss caused by a connecting carrier Norfolk Truckers Exch v Norfolk South ern R Co 116 Va 466 82 S E 92 Southern Pac Co v Lyon Miss 66 South 209 Pecos  N T R Co v Cox Tex Civ App 150

price of advertisements inserted in the Sunday and weekly editions of its paper All work except works of necessity or charity were prohib ited on Sunday by statute Held the plaintiff can recover the contract price of the advertisements since the publication of a newspaper on Sunday is a work of necessity Pulitzer Pub Co v McNichols Mo 181 S W 1 The decisions of the courts of the different states as to what are works of necessity within the meaning of the term as used in the Sunday laws vary according to the public policy of the different states for the term is elastic and indefinite See State v James 81 S C 197 62 S E 214 McGatrick v Wason 4 Ohio St 566 Hence that which is considered a work of necessity in one state may not be so considered in another State v Goff 20 Ark 289 State v Turner 67 Ind 595 It is generally agreed that the meaning of the term work of necessity is not confined to absolute physical necessity but that whatever is rea sonably necessary for the comfort convenience or wellbeing of a com munity on Sunday comes within the meaning of the term Common wealth v Louisville  Nash Ry Co 80 Ky 291 Augusta etc Ry Co v Renz 55 Ga 126 Yonoski v State 79 Ind 393 That work can be done with more convenience and less expense on Sunday does not make it a work of necessity State v Goff supra Commonwealth v White 190 Mass 578 77 N E 636 5 L R A N S 320 Nor does the fact that cer tain kinds of work are ordinarily considered necessary mean that they will be considered so if done on Sunday unless it be necessary to do the work on that day it does not come within the exception

in the absence of such special circumstances ordinary work cannot be justified under Sunday laws on the grounds of commercial necessity since their very object is to prohibit such activity Commtonwealth v White supra Airnheiter v State 115 Ga 572 41 S E 989 The publication of newspapers on Sun day may be considered a commercial necessity since news even a day old is practically worthless but their publication cannot be justified on that ground and until the decision in the principal case it was uni formly held that their publication and sale was illegal Handy v Globe Pub Co

public opinion has changed very much as to what activities are proper on Sunday and the interest of the public in world events has increased to such an extent that it seems the publica tion of Sunday newspapers could be justified on these grounds See State v James supra Edgerton v State 67 Ind 588 SURETYSHIP IN REPAYMENT BY CONTRACTOR TO MATERIALMANAPPLICA TION AS AGAINST OWNERMECHANICS LIENThe defendant owner of a building in process of construction made a payment to a contractor on estimates Out of this payment the contractor made a payment to a materialman who held unpaid accounts against the contractor for ma terials furnished for several buildings including the defendants The contractor not directing the application of the payment the material man without knowledge of the source of the funds applied them upon the contractors account for materials furnished for another building and brought an action to foreclose a mechanics lien on the defendants building for the whole amount of materials furnished for it Held the payment made by the contractor must be credited to the defendants account Sioux City Foundry  Mfg Co v Merten et al Iowa 156 N W 367 Independently of special statute the owner is under no personal ob ligation to protect the materialman Schrieber v Bank 99 Va 257 38 S E 134 Thus the general contractor being personally liable to the materialman on his contract and the owner not being personally liable but liability attaching to his building alone a case is presented where the property of one person is standing surety for the personal obliga tion of another creating the relation of suretyship in re Hill v Witimer 2 Phila Pa 72 Lowry v McKinney 68 Pa St 294 Bank of Albion v Burns 46 N Y 170 As such surety the owner is entitled to the bene fit of the rules prohibiting all dealings of the creditor with the principal debtor to his prejudice Bank of Albion v Burns supra The general rule is well settled that where a debtor makes a voluntary payment to his creditor who has several claims against him and fails to direct application of the payment on any particular claim the cred itor has the right to apply the payment to any of the claims which he has against the debtor North v LaFlesh 73 Wis 520 41 N W 633 Austin v Southern Home Bldg  Loan Assn 122 Ga 439 50 S E 382 Gay v Gay 5 All Mass 157 But some courts make an exception

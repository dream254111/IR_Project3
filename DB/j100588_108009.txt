J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108009,ON THE FIGURES OBTAINED BY STREWING SAND ON VIBRATING SURFACES COMMONLY CALLED ACOUSTIC FIGURES,I206988, 593  XXV ON THE FIGURES OBTAINED BY STREUING SAND ON VIBRATING SUIFACES COM MONLY CALLED ACOUSTIC FIGURES BY CHARLES WHEATSTONE ESQ COMMU NICATED BY MICHAEL FARADAY ESQ DCL FRS SSC SC 8SC RECEIVED FEBRUARY 12READ MARCH 14 1833  1 THALF A CENTURY HAS NEARLY ELAPSED SINCE THE ATTENTION OF PHILOSOPHERS WAS FIRST CALLED TO THE CURIOUS PHENOMENA EXHIBITED WHEN SAND IS STREWED ON VI BRATING SURFACES LONG BEFORE THIS TIME GALILEO HAD NOTICED THAT SMALL PIECES OF BRISTLE LAID ON THE SOUNDINGBOARD OF A NLUSICAL INSTRUMNENT WERE VIO LENTLY AGITATED ON SOME PARTS OF THE SURFACE WHILST ON OTHER PARTS THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO MOVE AND OUR OWN COUNTRYMAN DR HOOKE WHOSE SAGACITY IN ANTI CIPATING MANY OF THE DISCOVERIES OF LATER TIMES HAS BEEN SO FREQUENTLY REMARKED HAD PROPOSED TO OBSERVE THE VIBRATIONS OF A BELL BY STREWING FLOUR UPON IT BUT TO CHLADNI IS DUE THE SOLE MERIT OF HAVING DISCOVERED THE SYIMMETRICAL FIGURES EXHIBITED ON PLATES OF REGULAR FORMS WHEN CAUSED TO SOUND HIS FIRST INVESTI GATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT ENTDECKUNGEN IIBER DIE THEORIE DES KLANGES WERE PUBLISHED IN 1787 THIS WORK WAS FOLLOWED BY HIS AKUSTIK IN 1802 AND HIS NEUE BEYTRAGE ZUR AKUSTIK 1817 A FRENCH TRANSLATION BY HIMSELF OF HIS SECOND WORK WAS PUBLISHED AT PARIS IN 1809 ALL THE FIGURES OBTAINED BY CHLADNI ON SQUARE SURFACES ARE DELINEATED IN PAGES 611 613 615 THEY ARE COPIED FROM THE NEUE BEYTRAIGE WHICH WOLRK CONTAINS HIS MOST MATURE EXPERIMENTS BUT NOT HAVING BEEN TRANSLATED EITHER INTO FRENCH OR ENGLISH IT IS BUT LITTLE KNOWN IN THIS COUNTRY THE FOLLOWING ARE THE GENERAL RESULTS DEDUCED BY CHLADNI FROM HIS OBSERVATIONS RESPECTING THESE FIGURES HIS WORKS MAY BE REFERRED TO FOR THE DETAILS OMITTED AND FOR THOSE CONCERNING THE VILBRATIONS OF PLATES IN GENERAL IN ALL THE MODES OF VIBRATION OF A SQUARE OR RECTANGULAR PLATE THE FIGURESMR WHEATSTONE ON THE FIGURES OBTAINED EVEN IF THEY CONSIST OF DIAGONAL OR TORTUOUS LINES MAY ALL BE REFERRED TO A CER TAIN NUMBER OF NODAL LINES IN THE TWO DIRECTIONS PARALLEL TO THE SIDES TO ESTABLISH A CONVENIENT NOTATION FOR THESE FIGURES HE REPRESENTS THE LINES IN THE TWO DIRECTIONS BY NUMBERS SEPARATED BY A VERTICAL LINE THUS FOR EXAMPLE 310 SIGNIFIES THE MODE OF VIBRATION IN WHICH THERE ARE THREE LINES IN ONE DIRECTION AND NONE IN THE OTHER 512 DENOTES THAT IN WHICH THERE ARE FIVE LINES PARALLEL TO ONE SIDE AND TWO TO THE OTHER C THE NODAL LINES WHICH MAY ALWAYS BE CONSIDERED AS HAVING BEEN ORIGINALLY STRAIGHT MAY CURVE THEMSELVES MORE OR LESS AND IN GENERAL THE FLEXIONS OF THESE LINES WHETHER THEY ADJOIN EACH OTHER OR ARE SEPARATED BY A STRAIGHT LINE MUTUALLY APPROACH TO OR RECEDE FROM EACH OTHER IN SOME MODES OF VIBRATION THE NODAL LINES ARE NEVER STRAIGHT IN SOME INSTANCES THE SAME MODE OF VIBRATION MAY MANIFEST ITSELF IN TWO ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT WAYS ACCORDING AS THE FLEXIONS OF THE LINES OR THE GREATER NUMBER OF THEM ARE INWARD OR OUTWARD IN THE FIRST CASE THE SOUND IS USUALLY GRAVER THAN IN THE SECOND THIS DIFFERENCE IS REMARKED IN THOSE FIGURES WHERE THERE IS AN ENTIRE NUMBER OF FLEXIONS AS IN 210 311 4110 513 612 C BUT NEVER IN THOSE FIGURES WHERE THERE ARE 1 2 C AS IN 310 411 50 512 C TO DISTINGUISH THE FIRST FROM THE SECOND FIGURE CHLADNI PLACES A HORIZONTAL LINE ABOVE THE NUMBERS IN THE FIRST CASE AND BELOW THEM IN THE SECOND CASE THUS 412 412 WHEN TWO OR MORE FIGURES HAVING THE SAME NOTATION OCCUR IN THE TABLE THE OTHERS ARE TO BE CONSIDERED AS DISTORTIONS OF THE FIRST OCCASIONED BY ALTERING THE FIXED POINTS AND THE PLACE AT WHICH THE BOW IS APPLIED IF FOUR PLATES OF THE SAME SIZE AND UPON WHICH THE SAME FIGURE HAS BEEN PRODUCED BE PLACED TOGETHER SO AS TO FORM A LARGER SQUARE THIS COMPOUND FIGURE MAY ALSO BE MORE OR LESS ACCURATELY PRODUCED ON A SINGLE LARGER PLATE SEVERAL INSTANCES OF THIS MAY BE SEEN BY REFERENCE TO THE TABLE OF FIGURES THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS THE RELATIVE SOUNDS EXPRESSED BOTH BY THEIR MUSICAL NAMES AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR VIBRATIONS OF ALL THE MODES OF VIBRA TION OF A SQUARE PLATE EXPERIMENTALLY ASCERTAINED BY CHLADNI THE HORIZONTAL SERIES OF NUMBERS DENOTES THE LINES PARALLEL TO ONE OF THE SIDES AND THE VERTICAL SERIES THOSE PARALLEL TO THE OTHER 594BY STREWING SAND ON VIBRATING SURFACES TABLE F5 330 336 F  343 345 2 3 4 6 7 8 THE FIGURES PLACED AS EXPONENTS INDICATE THE OCTAVES IN WHICH THE SOUNDS OCCUR AND THE CHARACTERS  AND  DENOTE THAT THE SOUNDS TO THE CHARACTERS OF WHICH THEY ARE AFFIXED ARE RESPECTIVELY SHARPER AND FLATTER THAN THE TRUE IN TERVALS 1 595MR WHEATSTONE ON THE FIGURES OBTAINED HAVING THUS BRIEFLY STATED THE GENERAL RESULTS DEDUCED BY CHLADNI FROM HIS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES I SHALL PROCEED TO CLASS AND ANALYSE THE PHENOMENA AND I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW THAT ALL THE FIGURES OF VIBRATING SURFACES ARE THE RESULTANTS OF VERY SIMPLE MODES OF VIBRATION OSCILLATING ISOCHRONOUSLY AND SUPERPOSED UPON EACH OTHER THE RESULTANT FIGURE VARYING WITH THE COMPONENT NMODES OF VIBRATION THE NUMBER OF THE SUPERPOSITIONS AND THE ANGLES AT WHICH THEY ARE SUPERPOSED IN THIS FIRST PART OF THE INVESTIGATION I SHALL CONFINE MYSELF TO THE FIGURES OF SQUARE AND OTHER RECTANGULAR PLATES 2 THE MOST SIMPLE MODES OF VIBRATION OF A RECTANGULAR SURFACE ARE THOSE WHICH EXHIBIT QUIESCENT LINES PARALLEL TO ONE OF ITS EDGES EULER HAS THEORETICALLY ESTABLISHED THAT A ROD OR BAND HAVING BOTH ITS ENDS UNFIXED CAN VIBRATE WITH 2 3 4 5 6 C QUIESCENT LINES PARALLEL TO THE ENDS AND THAT THE CORRESPOND ING NUMBERS OF VIBRATION ARE VERY NEARLY AS THE SQUARES OF THE ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION 3 5 9 11 C THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE FULLY CONFIRMED BY EXPERI MRENT HE HAS PROVED MOREOVER THAT WHEN THE SAME MODE OF VIBRATION OF DIFFERENT PLATES IS COMPARED THE NUMBER OF VIBRATIONS IS INVERSELY AS THE SQUARE OF THE LENGTH OF THE PLATE BUT THAT INCREASE OF BREADTH OCCASIONS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE SOUND AND THAT THE DISTANCE FROM A FREE END TO A QUIESCENT LINE IS RATHER LESS THAN HALF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO QUIESCENT LINES FIG 1 A PAGE 617 SHOWS THE NUMBER AND SITUATIONS OF THE QUIESCENT LINES IN THE FIRST FOUR MODES OF VIBRATION OF THIS SERIES FIG 1 B AND C ARE PROFILES OF THE PRECEDING AND REPRESENT THE CURVATURE OF EACH PARALLEL FIBRE PERPENDICULAR TO THE QUIESCENT LINES AT THE TWO OPPOSITE LIMITS OF THEIR VIBRATION THE QUANTITY OF MOTION AT EACH POINT IS INDICATED BY THE CORRESPONDING ORDINATE OF THE CURVE AND ITS DIRECTION BY ITS SITUATION ABOVE OR BELOW THE HORIZONTAL LINE IT WILL BE CONVENIENT TO DISTINGUISH THESE STATES OF MOTION IN WHICH EVERY CORRESPOND ING POINT IS MOVING IN DIRECT OPPOSITION AND I SHALL THEREFORE CALL THE FIRST B POSITIVE STATES OF VIBRATION AND THE SECOND C NEGATIVE STATES OF VIBRATION WHEN THERE IS AN EVEN NUMBER OF QUIESCENT POINTS THE POSITIVE STATE OF VIBRA TION MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THAT IN WHICH THE MOTION AT THE CENTRAL PART IS ABOVE THE PLANE OF EQUILIBRIUM AND THE NEGATIVE THAT IN WHICH IT IS BELOW IT IF WE SUPPOSE TWO SIMILAR SURFACES WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF QUIESCENT LINES TO 596BY STREWING SAND ON VIBRATING SURFACES BE SUPERPOSED AND BOTH TO VIBRATE IN CONCURRENCE I E BOTH EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY THEY WILL MUTUALLY ASSIST EACH OTHERS EFFECTS BUT IF THEY VIBRATE IN OPPOSING DIRECTIONS THEY WILL DESTROY EACH OTHERS MOTIONS AND THE ENTIRE SURFACE WILL BE AT REST 3 WHEN THE RECTANGULAR SURFACE IS EQUILATERAL IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IT MAY VIBRATE IN TWO DIFFERENT RECTANGULAR DIRECTIONS SO AS TO GIVE THE SAME SOUND AND PRESENT THE SAME ARRANGEMENT OF QUIESCENT LINES NOW THIS PLATE MAY BE EX CITED AT VARIOUS POINTS WHERE THE MOTION OF EACH MOTDE OF VIBRATION IS AT ITS MAXIMUM IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND OF EQUAL INTENSITY SUCH BEING THE CASE THERE IS NO REASON WHY ONE MODE OF VIBRATION SHLOULD BE PRODUCED IN PREFERENCE TO THE OTHER AND ON CALCULATING THE EFFECT OF SUCH COEXISTENCE IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE RESULTANTS OF THESE COMBINED MODES OF VIBRATION SIMILAR IN EVERYTHING BUT IN THEIR DIRECTION WITH REGARD TO THE SIDES OF THE PLATE GIVE RISE TO NEW QUI ESCENT LINES WHICH ACCURATELY CORRESPOND WITH FIGURES DESCRIBED BY CHLADNI WHILE THE HENUMBER OF VIBRATIONS DOES NOT MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE COR PONENT MODES OF VIBRATION THE PRINCIPAL RESULTS OF THE SUPERPOSITION OF TWO SIMILAR MODES OF VIBRATION ARE THESE 1ST THE POINTS WHERE THE QUIESCENT LINES OF EACH FIGURE INTERSECT EACH OTHER REMAIN QUIESCENT POINTS IN THE RESULTANT FIGURE 2NDLY THE QUI ESCENT LINES OF ONE FIGURE ARE OBLITERATED WHEN SUPERPOSED BY THE VIBRATING PARTS OF THE OTHER 3RDLY NEW QUIESCENT POINTS WHICH MAY BE CALLED POINTS OF COMPENSATION ARE FORMED WHEREVER THE VIBRATIONS IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS NEU TRALIZE EACH OTHER AND LASTLY AT ALL OTHER POINTS THE MOTION IS AS THE SUM OF THE CONCURRING OR THE DIFFERENCE OF THE OPPOSING VIBRATIONS A PRIMARY FIGURE HAVING AN EVEN NUMBER OF QUIESCENT LINES MAY BE SUPER POSED TWO WAYS AND MAY CONSEQUENTLY GIVE RISE TO TWO DISTINCT RESULTANT FIGURES ONE WHEN THE CENTRAL VIBRATING PARTS CONCUR AND THE OTHER WHEN THEY ARE IN OPPOSITION BUT IF THE NUMBER OF THE QUIESCENT LINES IN THE PRIMARY FIGURE BE UNEVEN THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE RESULTANT FIGURE THE QUIESCENT LINES WHICH THUS RESULT MAY BE VERY EASILY ASCERTAINED I WILL TAKE AS AN EXAMPLE THE FIRST MODE OF VIBRATION HAVING TWO PARALLEL QUIESCENT LINES THIS BEING SUPERPOSED IN TWO RECTANGULAR DIRECTIONS AND SO THAT THE STATES OF VIBRATION ARE OPPOSING PAGE 617 FIG 2 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NO LINES OF MDCCCXXXIII 4 H 597MR WHEATSTONE ON THE FIGURES OBTAINED COMPENSATION CAN EXIST IN THE FOUR RECTANGULAR SEGMENTS A A A A AS EVERY POINT INCLUDED WITHIN THEM IS ACTUATED BY CONCURRENT MOTIONS BUT IN ALL THE OTHER RECTANGLES THEY MUST NECESSARILY BE FORMED AS EVERY POINT WITHIN THEM IS AFFECTED BY THE TWO OPPOSING MOTIONS AND IF THE TWO MODES BE OF EQUAL INTEN SITY THE COMPENSATIONS MUST OCCUR AT EVERY POINT EQUALLY DISTANT FROM THE TWO RECTANGULAR QUIESCENT LINES EACH APPERTAINING TO A DIFFERENT MODE OF VIBRATION THE RESULTANT FIGURE WILL THUS BE FOUND TO CONSIST OF TWO DIAGONAL LINES PER PENDICULAR TO EACH OTHER AND PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE PLATE BUT IF THE TWO SUPERPOSITIONS VIBRATE IN CONCURRENCE THE RECTANGLES B B B B WILL BE FREE FROM COMPENSATING POINTS BUT THESE WILL OCCUR IN THE OTHER RECTANGLES AND FORM THE FIGURE REPRESENTED FIG 3 WHICHL ALSO CONSISTS OF DIAGONAL LINES IN THE SAME MANNER THE RESULTANT OF ANY TWO SIMILAR MODES OF VIBRATION WITH NODAL LINES PARALLEL TO THE SIDES MAY BE PROVED TO CONSIST OF LINES PARALLEL TO THE DIAGONALS 4 IT IS NOT A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE VIBRATIONS OF A SQUARE PLATE THAT THE PRIMARY NODAL LINES SHALL BE PARALLEL TO A SIDE THEY MAY ALSO BE PARALLEL TO A DIAGONAL OR TO ANY LINE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN A TRANSVERSE AND A DIAGONAL LINE IN THESE CASES THE SUPERPOSITIONS TAKE PLACE ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING RULE THAT THE AXES OF THE SUPERPOSED MODES OF VIBRATION MUST MAKE EQUAL ANGLES WITH A TRANSVERSAL LINE PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRE FOR OTHERWISE THE MODES OF VIBRATION WOULD NOT BE SIMILAR BY THE AXIS OF A PRIMARY MODE OF VIBRATION I MEAN A STRAIGHT LINE PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE PLATE AND PARALLEL TO THE QUIESCENT LINES CONSIDERATIONS OF THE KIND ALREADY EMPLOYED WILL SHOW THAT IN ALL THESE INSTANCES THE RESULTANT FIGURES CONSIST OF LINES PARALLEL TO THE EDGES OF THE PLATE AND THAT THEY ARE ALWAYS THE SAME IN NUMBER AS THE NODAL LINES OF A COMPONENT MODE OF VIBRATION BUT DIFFERENTLY DISTRIBUTED IN THE TWO DIRECTIONS ACCORDING AS THE ANGLE OF SUPERPOSITION VARIES THE VARIOUS PRIMARY MODES OF VIBRATION TRANSVERSE INTERMEDIATE AND DIAGO NAL AND THE ANGLES WHICH THE QUIESCENT LINES OF TWO SIMILAR FIGURES MAKE WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THEY ARE SUPERPOSED ARE REPRESENTED IN THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE GENERAL TABLE PAGE 619633 IN THE SECOND COLUMN OF THIS TABLE ARE PLACED THE FIGURES RESULTING FROM THEIR OPPOSING SUPERPOSITIONS AND IN THE THIRD COLUMN THOSE WHICH ARISE FROM THEIR CONCURRING SUPERPOSITIONS 598BY STREWING SAND ON VIBRATING SURFACES WE OBTAIN BY EXPERIMENT A LIMITED NUMBER ONLY OF FIGURES WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED THE RESULTANTS OF PRIMARY MODES OF VIBRATION CONSISTING OF ANY GIVEN NUMBER OF OBLIQUE LINES BUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT AS THE VARIOUS DEGREES OF OBLIQUITY ARE INFINITE SO THERE SHOULD BE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF RESULTANT FIGURES PASSING INTO EACH OTHER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS BY CALCULATION THIS SHOULD BE SO BUT THERE ARE CAUSES OF LIMITATION WHICH I SHALL PROCEED TO EXPLAIN IT APPEARS THAT NO RESULTANT FIGURE IS MAINTAINABLE UNLESS THE GREATEST EXCUR SIONS OF THE EXTERNAL VIBRATING PARTS OCCUR AT THE EDGES OF THE PLATE IN THE CON CURRING SUPERPOSITIONS OF EIGHT OBLIQUE LINES THIS CONDITION CAN ONLY BE FULFILLED WHEN THE ANGLES THEY MAKE WITH EACH OTHER ARE EITHER 90 OR 143 8 IN THE FIRST CASE THE RESULTANT FIGURE CONSISTS OF FOUR LINES IN EACH TRANSVERSE DIRECTION IN THE SECOND OF SIX LINES IN ONE DIRECTION AND TWO IN THE OTHER IN THE OPPOSING SUPERPOSITIONS OF THE SAME NUMBER OF LINES THE CONDITION IS FULFILLED WHEN THE ANGLES AT WHICH THE LINES ARE INCLINED ARE 118 4 AND 1630 44 THE RE SULTANT FIGURE OF THE FORMER CONSISTS OF FIVE LINES IN ONE DIRECTION AND THREE IN THE OTHER AND THAT OF THE LATTER OF SEVEN IN ONE DIRECTION AND ONE IN THE OTHER  5 I HAVE IN THE PRECEDING SECTIONS DESCRIBED THEVARIOUS MODES OF BINARY SUPER POSITIONS WHICH MAY TAKE PLACE ON A SQUARE SURFACE BUT THERE ARE NUMEROUS CASES IN WHICH FOUR SUPERPOSITIONS MAY COEXIST AND THESE I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN THE AXIS OF A PRIMARY FIGURE CORRESPONDS EITHER WITH A DIAGONAL OR WITH A TRANSVERSE LINE PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE PLATE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE OTHER LINE OF EQUAL LENGTH WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THE AXIS OF A SIMILAR AND ISOCHRONOUS MODE OF VIBRATION IN THESE CASES IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE TWO SUPERPOSITIONS BUT IN EVERY INTERMEDIATE DIRECTION OF AN AXIS THERE ARE THREE OTHER LINES OF EQUAL LENGTH WHICH CONSTITUTE AXES OF SIMILAR MODES OF VIBRATION AND FOUR SUPERPOSITIONS CAN THEREFORE TAKE PLACE WHENEVER THE AXIS OF A COMPONENT MODE OF VIBRATION IS NEITHER A DIAGONAL NOR A TRANSVERSE LINE IT WOULD BE A TEDIOUS AND LABORIOUS PROCESS TO ASCERTAIN A RESULTANT FIGURE BY COMBINING ITS FOUR COMPONENT MODES OF VIBRATION BUT THE SAME PURPOSE WILL BE EFFECTUALLY ANSWERED BY COMBINING THEM FIRST IN PAIRS AS EXPLAINED IN THE 4H 2 599MR WHEATSTONE ON THE FIGURES OBTAINED PRECEDING SECTION AND THEN COMBINING TWO OF THESE FIRST RESULTANTS RECTANGU LARLY TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING PROCESS AFFORDS GREAT FACILITY FOR ASCERTAINING THE SECOND RESULTANT FIGURE WHICH ARISES FRIOM THE SUPERPOSITION OF TWO FIRST RESULTANTS A AND B FIG 4 PAGE 617 ARE THE TWO COMPONENT FIRST RESULTANTS THE SIMILAR LINES OF ONE BEING PLACED RECTANGULARLY TO THOSE OF THE OTHER THE VIBRATING PARTS ARE INDICATED BY THE LETTERS P AND N ACCORDING AS THE VIBRATIONS ARE POSI TIVE OR NEGATIVE AT C THE TWO FIGURES ARE SUPERPOSED A BEING REPRESENTED BY THE CONTINUOUS AND B BY THE DOTTED LINES THE SURFACE IS NOW SUBDIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF UNEQUAL RECTANGLES AND BY COMPARING THE TWO COMPONENT FIGURES TOGETHER IT IS EASY TO SEE WHICH OF THESE RECTANGLES ARE INFLUENCED BY CON SPIRING AND WHICH BY OPPOSING MOTIONS IF THE MOTIONS ARE FOUND TO CONSPIRE THE LETTERS P OR N MUST BE PLACED IN THESE RECTANGLES ACCORDING AS THE COEXIST ING MOTIONS ARE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IF THE MOTIONS ARE IN OPPOSITION A MARK MAY BE MADE TO INDICATE THAT A QUIESCENT LINE PASSES THROUGH THIS RECTANGLE WHEREVER A CONTINUOUS LINE INTERSECTS A DOTTED LINE A MARK IS TO BE MADE TO INDICATE THAT A QUIESCENT POINT IS FORMED AND AS IN EVERY OTHER PART THE QUI ESCENT LINES OF ONE FIGURE PASS OVER VIBRATING PARTS OF THE OTHER THE BOUNDARY LINES OF ALL THE RECTANGLES MUST BE MARKED WITH THE LETTERS INDICATING THE MO TIONS OF THE VIBRATING PARTS THEY SUPERPOSE THE FIGURE C BEING THUS MARKED THE RESULTANT FIGURE IS EASILY DESCRIBED BY JOINING THE FIXED POINTS BY LINES DRAWN THROUGH THE RECTANGLES SHOWN TO BE ACTUATED BY OPPOSING MOTIONS CAREFULLY AVOIDING TO ENCROACH UPON THE RECTANGLES OF CONSPIRING MOTION MARKED P OR N THAT THE DIAGONAL LINE IS PERFECTLY STRAIGHT MAY BE PROVED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER IT MUST FIRST BE PREMISED THAT THE RECTANGLES INCLUDED WITHIN THE QUIESCENT LINES OF EACH OF THE FIRST RESULTANT FIGURES HAVE PRECISELY THE SAME QUANTITY OF MOTION IN THE SAME RELATIVE POINTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SURROUNDING SIDES AND THAT THE VIBRATING PARTS AT THE EDGES AND CORNERS OF THE PLATE MUST BE CONSIDERED RESPECTIVELY AS EXACT HALVES AND QUARTERS OF A COMPLETE VIBRATING PART THIS BEING UNDERSTOOD IF TWO SIMILAR FIRST RESULTANTS BE LAID ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER IN THE DIRECTIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE TO BE SUPERPOSED AND IF A DIA GONAL LINE BE SIMILARLY DRAWN THROUGH EACH OF THEM IT WILL BE OBVIOUS THAT EVERY CORRESPONDING POINT OF EACH LINE MUST POSSESS THE SAME INTENSITY OF MOTION IF THE SUCCESSIVE SEGMENTS EQUAL IN EACH FIGURE THROUGH WHICH THE 600BY STREWING SAND ON VIBRATING SURFACES LINES SIMULTANEOUSLY PASS BE IN OPPOSITE STATES OF VIBRATION THEY WILL NEUTRALIZE EACH OTHERS EFFECTS AND A DIAGONAL QUIESCENT LINE WILL BE FORMED AND IF THEY BE CONCURRING ALL THE PARTS BETWEEN THE COINCIDENT OR FIXED POINTS WILL BE IN MOTION IN THE DIAGRAM FIG 4 C ONE DIAGONAL IS IN THE FIRST STATE AND THE OTHER IN THE SECOND IF THE NUMBER OF LINES IN THE COMPONENT FIRST RESULTANT FIGURES BE UNEVEN THEY ADMIT OF ONLY ONE MODE OF SUPERPOSITION BUT FIRST RESULTANTS HAVING AN EVEN NUMBER OF QUIESCENT LINES ADMIT OF BEING SUPERPOSED IN TWO WAYS ACCORD ING AS THEY ARE VIBRATING IN CONCURRENCE OR IN OPPOSITION IT FREQUENTLY OCCURS THAT ENTIRE QUIESCENT LINES SUPERPOSE EACH OTHER THUS WHEN IN THE COMPONENT FIGURE THERE IS AN UNEVEN NUMBER OF LINES IN EACH DIRECTION THE TWO RECTANGULAR CENTRAL LINES OF EACH SUPERPOSED FIGURE MUST COALESCE AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY CONTINUE IN BOTH THE RESULTANT FIGURES EXANI PLES OF THIS ARE SEEN IN THE RESULTANTS OF 311 511 513 711 713 715 C AGAIN WHEN THE NUNLBER OF QUIESCENT LINES IN ONE DIRECTION OF THE COMPONENT FIGURE IS THREE TIMES GREATER THAN THAT IN THE OTHER THE NUMBER OF COINCIDING FIXED LINES IN EACH DIRECTION OF THE RESULTANT FIGURE IS EQUAL TO THE SMALLEST NUMBER IN THE FIRST RESULTANT AS IN 612 913 1214 1515 C SEE THE GENERAL TABLE PAGE 619633 THE FOLLOWING GENERAL RESULTS ARE OBTAINED FROM CONSTRUCTING THE SECOND RESULTANT FIGURES ACCORDING TO THE RULES ABOVE GIVEN IN SUPERPOSING FIRST RESULTANTS CONSISTING OF AN EVEN NUMBER OF LINES 1ST WHEN THE NUMBER OF LINES IN EACH DIRECTION OF THE FIRST RESULTANTS IS EVEN AND THE MODES OF VIBRATION ARE CONCURRING NO LINE PASSES THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE SECOND RESULTANT FIGURE WHEN THE MODES OF VIBRATION ARE OP POSING TWO RECTANGULAR DIAGONAL LINES OF COMPENSATION OCCUR 2NDLY WHEN THE NUMBER OF LINES IN EACH DIRECTION IS UNEVEN AND THE MODES OF VIBRATION ARE CONCURRING THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO PERPENDICULAR TRANSVERSAL LINES PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRE AND WHEN THE MODES ARE OPPOSING THERE ARE IN ADDITION TO THESE FIXED LINES THE TWO DIAGONAL LINES OF COMPENSATION WHEN THE FIRST RESULTANTS CONSIST OF AN UNEVEN NUMBER OF LINES IN WHICH CASE THERE IS NO DISTINCTION OF CONCURRING AND OPPOSING VIBRATIONS ONE DIAGO NAL LINE ONLY INVARIABLY OCCURS IN NO CASE IS IT NECESSARY TO CALCULATE AN ENTIRE FIGURE WHEN THE NUMBER OF NODAL LINES IN THE PRIMARY MODE OF VIBRATION IS EVEN ONLY ONE QUARTER OF 601MR WHEATSTONE ON THE FIGURES OBTAINED THE FIGURE IS REQUIRED TO BE CALCULATED AS IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERY SECOND RE SULTANT OF THIS KIND CONSISTS OF FOUR SYMMETRICAL AND AS IT WERE REFLECTED POR TIONS BUT WHEN THE PRIMARY NUMBER OF QUIESCENT LINES IS UNEVEN IT IS NECES SARY TO CALCULATE ONE HALF THE OTHER HALF IS SYMMETRICAL AND INVERTED SOME OF THE FIRST RESULTANTS ARE NEVER OBTAINED BY EXPERIMENT WHEN THE NUMBER OF QUIESCENT LINES IN THE PRIMARY MODE OF VIBRATION IS UNEVEN EITHER THE FIRST OR THE SECOND RESULTANT MAY BE OBTAINED AT PLEASURE THUS IN 312 IF THE IMPULSES BE MADE AT A CORNER WHERE THE MOTION OF BOTH SUPERPOSITIONS IS AT ITS MAXIMUM THE SECOND RESULTANT MUST ARISE BUT IF THEY BE MADE AT THE MIDDLE OF A SIDE THE FIRST RESULTANT ONLY WILL APPEAR BECAUSE THE POINT OF EX CITATION IS A QUIESCENT POINT OF THE OTHER BUT IN ALL CASES WHERE THERE IS AN EVEN NUMBER OF LINES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN THE FIRST RESULTANT BECAUSE EACL MAXIMUM OF VIBRATION EQUALLY BELONGS TO BOTH SUPERPOSITIONS 6 I HAVE GIVEN IN PAGES 619633 A TABLE WHICH SHOWS EVERY PERFECT RE SULTANT FIGURE OF A SQUARE SURFACE WHEN THE NUMBER OF QUIESCENT LINES IN THE PRIMARY MODES OF VIBRATION DOES NOT EXCEED TWELVE I HAVE CAREFULLY CALCU LATED EACH FIGURE BY THE RULES LAID DOWN IN THE PRECEDING SECTIONS AND HAVE SHOWN IN THE TABLE THE SUCCESSIVE PROCESSES OF SUPERPOSITION THE FIRST VER TICAL ROW EXHIBITS THE TWO PRIMARY MODES OF VIBRATION SUPERPOSED AT THE RE QUIRED ANGLES ONE FIGURE BEING REPRESENTED BY THE CONTINUOUS LINES AND THE OTHER BY THE DOTTED LINES THE SECOND ROW CONTAINS THE FIRST RESULTANTS WHICH ARISE FROM THE OPPOSING SUPERPOSITIONS OF THE PRECEDING AND THE THIRD ROW THOSE WHICH RESULT FROM THEIR CONCURRING SUPERPOSITIONS THE FOURTH AND FIFTH ROWS EXHIBIT THE PERFECT SECOND RESULTANTS WHICH ARE FORMED THE FORMER BY THE OPPOSING AND THE LATTER BY THE CONCURRING SUPERPOSITIONS OF THE FIRST RESULT ANT WHICH THE PLATE HAS BEEN ALREADY FOUND COMPETENT TO PRODUCE ON COMPARING THE CALCULATED FIGURES WITH THOSE OBTAINED EXPERIMENTALLY BY CHLADNI THE GREATER NLUMBER ARE FOUND EXACTLY TO AGREE THERE ARE HOWEVER SOME DIFFERENCES WHICH IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS AN OBVIOUS CAUSE OF ERROR IN DELINEATING FIGURES FROM EXPERIMENT FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCETHAT THE SAND ACCUMULATES IN THE SPACES WHERE TWO CONVEX CURVES ARE NEAR AND OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER THE MOTION BEING THERE VERY SMALL SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE CURVES JOIN OR NOT SECONDLY 602BY STREWING SAND ON VIBRATING SURFACES INEQUALITIES IN THE PLATE WILL SOMETIMES OCCASION LINES WHICH OUGHT TO INTERSECT EACH OTHER SO AS TO APPEAR SEPARATED CURVES ON COMPARING TOGETHER THE FIGURES CHLADNI HAS MARKED AS 614 614 712 714 813 C C WITH THOSE OF THE CALCULATED TABLE THEY WILL BE FOUND TO DIFFER ONLY IN THESE RESPECTS ANOTHER CAUSE OF DIFFERENCE IS THIS WHEN THE LINES OF ONE COMPONENT FIGURE VERY NEARLY COINCIDE WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER BUT WITHOUT ACTUALLY DOING SO THE RESULTANT FIGURE MAY BE SUCH AS WOULD ARISE FROM THEIR ACTUAL SUPERPOSITION INSTEAD OF THAT WHICH ACCURATE CALCULATION WOULD GIVE IN CHLADNIS TABLE THERE ARE TWO INSTANCES OF THIS ALTERATION 712 A AND 813 A A FEW OF THE FIGURES DELINEATED BY CHLADNI ARE IRREGULAR RESULTANTS FORMED BY THE SUPERPOSITIONS OF DISSIMILAR MODES OF VIBRATION THESE IRREGULAR RE SULTANTS CAN BE FORMED ONLY WHEN THE DISSIMILAR COMPONENT MODES OF VIBRATION GIVE THE SAME SOUND AND HAVE A MAXIMUM POINT OF VIBRATION IN COMMON AT WHICH THEY CAN BE SIRNULTANEOUSLY EXCITED THE FIGURE MARKED BY CHLADNI 6 1 I FIND TO BE AN IRREGULAR RESULTANT FORMED BY THE COMBINATION OF 611 WITH 315 WHICH BOTH GIVE THE SAME SOUND C4 THE IRREGULAR FIGURE MARKED IN HIS TABLE 511 A IS A COMPOUND OF 511 AND 215 THE CALCULATED FIGURES 611 711 811 911 1011 1012 AND 1111 ARE NOT TO BE FOUND IN CHLADNIS TABLE THE NEAR APPROACH OF THE INCLINED LINES OF THEIR PRIMARY COMPONENT FIGURES TO PARALLELISM IS THE CAUSE OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING THESE FIGURES BY EXPERIMENT THE FIGURES MARKED BY CHLADNI 1013 914 815 716 1014 915 816 AND 917 EXCEED THE LIMITS WITHIN WHICH I HAVE CALCULATED THE TABLE AND ARE THEREFORE NOT TO BE FOUND IN IT  7 IMPERFECT RESULTANT FIGURES I HAVE HITHERTO CONSIDERED THOSE RESULTANT FIGURES ONLY WHICH ARISE FROM THE SUPERPOSITIONS OF SIMILAR MODES OF VIBRATION EACH EXACTLY EQUAL IN INTENSITY THESE I SHALL IN FUTURE CALL PERFECT RESULTANT FIGURES BUT WHEN THE VIBRATIONS OF THE SUPERPOSED MODES ARE UNEQUAL IN INTENSITY THEN A FIGURE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE PERFECT RESULTANT AND ONE OF ITS COMPONENTS IS FORMED  THESE IN TERMEDIATE FIGURES I SHALL CALL IMPERFECT RESULTANTS THEY ARE EXPERIMENTALLY OBTAINED BY VARYING IN A SLIGHT DEGREE THE PLACES AT WHICH THE PLATE IS HELD OR TOUCHED FROM THOSE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE CORRESPONDING PERFECT RESULTANT FIGURE THE PLACE AT WHICH THE BOW IS APPLIED REMAINING IN BOTH CASES THE SAME FIG 6 A B C D E IN CHLADNIS TABLE PAGE 611 REPRESENTS THE SUCCESSIVE 603MR WHEATSTONE ON THE FIGURES OBTAINED TRANSFORMATIONS OF FIGURE WHICH TAKE PLACE WHEN EACH COMPONENT MODE OF VIBRA TION PRESENTS THREE TRANSVERSAL LINES A AND E ARE THE TWO COMPONENTS C THE PERFECT RESULTANT B AN IMPERFECT RESULTANT IN WHICH THE EXCURSIONS OF A ARE THE GREATEST AND D AN IMPERFECT RESULTANT IN WHICH E HAS THE GREATEST ENERGY FIG 11 A 6 PAGE 611 EXHIBITS THE TRANSITIONS OF THE OPPOSING SUPERPOSITION OF TWO PRIMARY FIGURES EACH PRESENTING FOUR TRANSVERSAL LINES AND FIG 12 A AND B THE CHANGES OF THE CONCURRING SUPERPOSITION OF THE SAME THESE ARE THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF PRIMARY FIGURES INTO FIRST RESULTANTS IN EACH OF THESE SERIES OF TRANSITIONS THERE ARE CERTAIN POINTS WHICH ARE INVARIABLE DURING EVERY CHANGE THESE ARE THE QUIESCENT POINTS FORMED BY THE NODAL LINES OF ONE FIGURE INTERSECTING THOSE OF THE OTHER AND THE CENTRES OF VIBRATION WHERE THE MAXIMA OF POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE VIBRATION AGREE IN EACH COMPONENT MODE OF VIBRATION THE POINTS OF COMPENSATION ARE CHANGEABLE FIGS 29 A AND 30 A PAGE 613 REPRESENT IMPERFECT SECOND RESULTANTS FORMED BY TWO SUPERPOSITIONS OF THE FIRST RESULTANT FIGURE 612 FIG 29 A ARISES FROM CONCURRING AND FIG 30 A FROM OPPOSING SUPERPOSITIONS THE STRAIGHT LINES IN THESE IMPERFECT FIGURES ARISE FROM THE COINCIDENCE OF ENTIRE QUIESCENT LINES IN EACH COMPONENT FIGURE AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY REMAIN UNALTERED WHATEVER MAY BE THE RELATIVE INTENSITIES OF THE SUPERPOSED MODES OF VIBRATION BUT THE CURVED LINES WHICH ARE FORMED OF COMPENSATING POINTS CHANGE WITH THE VARYING IN TENSITIES 8 FIGURES OF IRREGULAR PLATES IF THE SIDES OF THE SQUARE BE NEARLY BUT NOT EXACTLY EQUAL THE SUPERPOSITIONS OF TWO SIMILAR MODES OF VIBRATION WITH TRANSVERSAL LINES STILL TAKE PLACE BUT INSTEAD OF EXHIBITING PERFECT RESULTANTS FIGURES RESEMBLING TRANSITIONAL FIGURES APPEAR THUS IN THE BINARY SUPERPOSITION PAGE 611 FIG 1 OF THE FIGURE WITH TWO TRANSVERSAL LINES IF THE SIDES BE UNEQUAL THE CROSSED LINES SEPARATE AT THEIR POINT OF INTERSECTION AND ARE CONVERTED INTO TWO CURVES THE SUMMITS OF WHICH RECEDE FROM EACH OTHER AS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LENGTHS OF THE SIDES BECOMNES GREATER ALSO IF THE DIAGONALS OF THE SQUARE BE UNEQUAL THE RESULTANT FIGURE PAGE 611 FIG 2 ARISING FROM TWO SUPERPOSED MODES OF VIBRATION WITH DIAGONAL AXES WILL BE MODIFIED IN A SIMILAR MANNER CORRESPONDING MODIFICATIONS ARE OCCASIONED THROUGH ACCIDENTAL DIFFERENCES OF ELASTICITY C IN THE DIRECTIONS OF THE AXES OF THE SUPERPOSED MODES OF VIBRA TION EVEN WHEN THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PLATE ARE APPARENTLY EQUAL 604BY STREWING SAND ON VIBRATING SURFACES IF A PLATE OF GLASS BE COVERED ON ONE OF ITS SIDES WITH LEAFGOLD OR IF A PLATE OF GROUND GLASS BE SUBSTITUTED FOR AN ORDINARY GLASS PLATE WITH SMOOTH SUR FACES THE FIGURES MAY BE OBTAINED DISTINCTLY DELINEATED BY LINES CONSISTING OF A SINGLE ROW OF GRAINS OF SAND EXPERIMENTS MADE IN THIS MANNER UPON SQUARE PLATES CAREFULLY PREPARED INDUCED PROFESSOR STREHLKE TO CONCLUDE AFTER MANY MINUTE MEASUREMENTS OF THESE LINES THAT ALL ACOUSTIC FIGURES ARE FORMED OF HYPERBOLIC CURVES AND THAT THE QUIESCENT LINES NEVER INTERSECT EACH OTHER BUT HOWEVER CORRECT THESE EXPERIMENTS MAY HAVE BEEN THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THEM ARE UNWARRANTED WERE IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN PLATES OF A PERFECTLY HOMOGENEOUS SUBSTANCE AND OF ACCURATELY EQUAL DIMENSIONS THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE LINES HOWEVER FINELY DEFINED WOULD ACTUALLY INTERSECT EACH OTHER  9 I HAVE ALREADY  1 GIVEN CHLADNIS TABLE OF THE COMPARATIVE SOUNDS AND NUMBERS OF VIBRATIONS OF THE FIGURES OF SQUARE SURFACES OBTAINED FROM EXPERI MENT IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE THESE RESULTS ARE ARRANGED SO AS TO CORRESPOND WITH THE VIEWS TAKEN IN THIS PAPER THE NUMBERS IN THE FIRST VERTICAL ROW INDICATE THE NUMBER OF PARALLEL QUIESCENT LINES IN THE PRIMARY FIGURE IN THE HORIZONTAL ROWS THE ANGLES AT WHICH THE LINES OF THE PRIMARY MODES OF VIBRATION INTERSECT EACHL OTHER ARE SHOWN AND THE FIGURES BETWEEN BRACKETS GIVE THE NOTATION OF THE FIRST RESULTANT PRODUCED BY THEIR SUPERPOSITION BELOW THESE ITS NUMBER OF VIBRATIONS AND THE CHARACTER REPRESENTING ITS MUSICAL SOUND ARE GIVEN WHEN THERE ARE TWO OF THESE LOWER LINES SEPARATED BY A HORIZONTAL DASH THE ONE ABOVE INDICATES THE SOUND OF THE OPPOSING SUPERPOSITION AND THAT BELOW IT THE CONCURRING SUPERPOSITION THUS IT APPEARS THAT EVERY FIGURE OF A SQUARE SURFACE WHICH EXPERIMENT CAN GIVE MAY BE REDUCED TO A PRIMARY FIGURE WITH PARALLEL LINES GIVING THE SAME SOUND IF THEREFORE THE ANALYTICAL INVESTIGATION BE CONFINED TO THESE MANY OF THE DIFFICULTIES WILL DISAPPEAR EULER HAS INVESTIGATED THE SUBJECT WHEN LINES PARALLEL TO A SIDE ONLY ARE CONCERNED IT REMAINS TO EXTEND THE INQUIRY TO MODES OF VIBRATION THE NODAL LINES OF WHICH ARE PERPENDICULAR TO ANY LINE PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE SURFACE AN ANALYTICAL EXPRESSION FOR ALL THE SOUNDS OF A SQUARE PLATE MAY PROBABLY BE OBTAINED WHICH SHALL BE A FUNCTION OF THE NUMBER OF QUIESCENT LINES AND THE LENGTH OF THE AXIS OF THE MODE OF VIBRATION MDCCCXXXIII 4 I 605TABLE G 6 D9 EF 10 3

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

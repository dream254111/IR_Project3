insurance provided that no premiums in arrears could be received except by agreement in writing signed by certain officers of the society an agent employed or authorized to collect an overdue premium had no authority to bind the insurer to grant an extension of time to pay such premium 3 SameEstoppelA policy provided that general agents had no authority to extend the time for the payment of premiums but a rule of the company authorized acceptance of overdue premiums between the due date and that when the premium receipt must be returned for cancellation unless paid provided the superintendent can certify that the former insured is in good health An agent authorized to accept an overdue premium went to the house of insured to collect the same and without authority agreed to accept the premium on the succeeding day requesting the insurers assistant superintendent to collect the same which he agreed but failed to do and on such day insured was sick from the illness of which she died Held that such facts did not estop the insurer from enforcing a forfeiture of the policy for nonpayment of premium 4 EvidenceCompetencyConclusionsIn an action on a policy questions as to whether insured would have paid the premium on the day it was demanded in case she had been told that the policy would otherwise be forfeited and whether it was not the duty of the agent of the insurer to collect the premiums at insureds residence after the time for payment had been extended were incompetent as calling for conclusions CHESTNUT v CHESTNUT Nov 23 1905 52 S E 348 1 Bills and

in which case equity may correct it Ed NoteFor cases in point see vol 7 Cent Dig Bills and Notes  89 2 SameIn the absence of evidence that the blank in a note with reference to the amount thereof was the result of a mistake the presumption is that the payee who is the holder may fill up the blank with the amount agreed on and this right continues unless his exercise thereof has been unreasonably

EDMUNDSON Nov 23 1905 52 S E 350 1 InsuranceFire PolicyProofs of LossTime for Furnishing Where a fire policy provides for furnishing of proofs of loss within 60 days but it is not provided that there should be a forfeiture in case of failure to so furnish them it is sufficient if they are furnished within a reasonable time 2 SameInstructionsIn an action on a fire policy the evidence was conflicting as to whether insured was told by the agents of the insurer at the time the insurance was taken that an inventory exhibited by insured was sufficient and defendant requested an instruction that if it was understood between the parties that the inventory offered was not a sufficient compliance with the provisions of the policy and that insured promised to make a new inventory and on such understanding the policy was written plaintiff could not re cover Held that it was proper to modify the instruction by stating that such was the case unless insured was told by insurers agent at the time the insurance was taken that the inventory was sufficient 3 SameIronSafe ClauseSubstantial ComplianceA substantial compliance by an insured in a fire policy with the ironsafe clause is sufficient

AUGUSTE CAHOURS FCS Received May 15 1857 Abstract In a communication addressed to the Royal Society some time ago Proceedings vol viii No 1 9 we endeavoured to delineate the cha racters of a new alcoholthe Allylic alcohol which is the prototype of a new class of alcohols We have since continued these researches in order to complete the history of this remarkable compound In submitting to the Royal Society the full account of our expe rimients upon the subject we beg leave to menition in this abstract briefly some additional compounds which we have examined since ouir last communication512 Sulphide of Allyl Garlic Oil C12 Il1 S  When iodide of allyl is allowed to fall drop by drop into a concentrated alcoholic solution of protosulphide of potassiumn a very energetic action ensues the liquid becomes very hot alnd an abiundant crystalline deposit takes place of iodide of potassium It is imnportant that the iodide of ally should only be added gradually to avoid spirting by which a part of the product would be lost As soon as the action ceases the liquid is mixed with a slight excess of sulphide of potassium addition of water now separates a light yellowish limpid oil possess ingo a strong smell of garlic When rectified this liquLid becomes colourless it boils at 1400 C and gives with nitrate of silver a crystal line precipitate soluble in a boiling mixture of alcohol anid water and separating from this solvent in the form of beautiful white needles absolutely identical with those which the natural esselnce of garlic produces Sulphide of allyl also comports itself with corrosive sublimate anid with bichloride of platinun exactly like the natural garlic oil AllylMercaptan C6 11 S2 When in the process for the prepa ration of the preceding compound the protosulphide of potassium is replaced by the hycdrosulphate of sulphide of potassium a volatile product is obtained having a similar but more ethereal odour This substance acts with energy upon protoxide of mercury with which it forms a compound dissolving in boiling alcohol anid separating from it on cooling in the form of pearly scales of remarkable brilliancy which present the greatest resemblance to tlle mercaptide of mercury The liquid obtained in the abovementioned reaction boils at 900 and possesses a composition and ani aggregate of properties which closely resemble those of the mereaptan of the ethylseries being int fact the allylic mercaptan C6 HG S2 Allylamine C6 117 NBy boiling cyanate of allyl C8 I15 NO2 with a concentrated solution of caustic potassa until the oily layer entirely disappears a complete decomposition ensues alnd the residue contains only a mixture of carbonate of potassium with an excess of the alkaline hydrate the volatile products condensed in hydrochloric acid fuirnish a saline mnass which may be obtained crystalline on evaporation This substance is always a mixture the constituents of which vary both in nature anld properties The action of potassa on it not only separates a base wlhich is readily soluLble in water btit513 also insoluble basic oils the boilingpoinit of which rises to 1800 C Simple distillationi of the liberated bases appears to give rise to de compositions and thus to induce further complication We have not succeeded in ascertainilng with perfect precision the nature of this mixture but we have found that it invariably containis a con siderable quantity of a base which bears the same relation to allylic alcohol that is observed between ethylaminie and ordinary alcohol The formation of this substance which we propose to designate allylamine C 117 N is perfectly analogous to the production of ethylamine by means of cyanate of ethyl Diallylarnine C12 1111 NImpure allylamine obtained by the action of potassa on the cyanate when digested with a second quan tity of iodide of allyl is rapidly changed into a mass of hydriodates of new compounds This crystalline mass evidently conitains a con siderable quantity of the hydriodate of diallylaminie but to succeed in separating it from this very complicated mixture would have re quired a more considerable quantity of substance than we had at our disposal lTriallylanine CIS HI NThe oxide of tetrallylammonium to which we shall presently allude submitted to the action of heat is decomposed with liberation of a basic oil The perfect analogy of the oxide of tetrallylammonium with the corresponding ethylcom pound leaves no doubt respecting the nature of this basic substance It is obviously triallylamine When saturated with lhydrochloric acid anid mixed with bichloride of platinum it deposits a yellow plati numsalt the analysis of which leads to the formula Cs s N E Cl lt C1 C6 115J Oxide of Tetrallylamnonium C241H20NO HO The chief product of the action of ammonia upon iodide of allyl is a magnificent crystal line compound which is deposited from the solution resultilng from the reaction Iodide of allyl is rapidly attaeked even by an aqueous solution of ammonia at the common teinperature By a few days contact a large quantity of the iodide dissolves and the solution be comes a solid mass If no depositioni of crystals take place fromn tlle soluLtion it is only lnecessary to add a concenitrated solution of caustic potassa which causes the separation of an oily layer that514 speedily solidifies The crystals thus formed are the iodide of te trallylammonium which like the corresponding compound of the ethylseries is but slightly soluble in solution of potassa It is ob tained pure by exposing it to the air until the potassa is converted into carbonate auid then recrystallizinig it from absolute alcohol The iodide by treatment with oxide of silver is immediately tralls formed into the oxide This forms an alkaline solution which pos sesses all the properties of the oxide of tetrethylammolnium The iodide conitainis C6 H1 Cli 115 N I C6 5 On taking a retrospective glance at the results obtainied in this inquiry it is obvious that propylene a homologue of olefiant gas is susceptible of furnishing a monoacid alcohol which bears to it the same relationi that is observed between methylalcohol and marsh gas or between benzoic alcohol and toluol the analogue of marsh gas among the derivatives of the aromatic acids The hydrocarbonls homologous and analogous to marshgas the homologues of olefiant gas and indeed probably a very considerable number of other hydro carbons may be regarded as startingpoints for the production of monoacid alcohols and of all their derivatives All these alcohols are formed by the fixation of two equivalenits of oxygen which oxi dation however cannot be effected directly but is accomplished by a series of substitutionprocesses C214402C21402 Marshgas Metlhylalcohol C14 H1 02 C14 H 02 Toluol Benzoylalcohol C6 16  02  C6 H1 02 Iropylene Allylalcohol But olefiant gas and its holiologues are capable of furnishling mono10acid alcohols by another r eactioni wlhich has not yet been515 applied to the series of bodies homologous to marshgas In fact we have learnt by the beautiful researches of M Berthelot that ole fiant gas and its homolooues are capable of being transformed into alcohols by the absorptioln of two equivalenits of water olefiant gas furnishes by this reaction ordinary alcohol and propylene propylic alcohol thus C4 H4 2HOC4 I6 02 Olefiant gas Ethylic alcohol C6 H6  2H10 C6 18 02 Propylene Propylic alcohol Olefiant gas then alnd all its homologues are capable of furnish ing two monoacid alcohols exhibiting slightly different features but resenting in all their principal characters the most obvious analogy The alcohols formed by fixation of water such as ethylic alcohol have long been well kinown in fact the detailed study which has been made during the last quarter of a century of most of their derivatives has exercised the most beneficial influence upoil the development of organic chemistry The same remark does not apply to the alcohols produced from these same hydrocarbons by fixation of oxygen The history of allylic alcohol which we have endeavoured to trace in the preceding pages and to which of late important contributions have been fur nished moreover by MM Berthelot and De Luca and by M Zinin begins to throw light also upon this second group of alcohols For this reason the discovery of allylic alcohol appears to clainm the attention of chemists even if it had not assisted in fixing in the system of organic compounds the exact position of several very in terestinig natural products viz the sulphuretted oils furnished by the bulbs of the garlic Alliumn sativum and the seeds of the black nustard Sinapis nigra which it had not been possible up to the present time to group around a similar centre

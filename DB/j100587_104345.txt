SOME OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE VIRTUE OF THE JELLY OF BLACK CURRANTS IN CURING INFLAMMATIONS IN THE THROAT BY HENRY BAKER F R S S I N C E PROVIDENCE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO BESTOW CERTAIN MEDICINAL VIRTUES ON MANY ANIMALS VEGETABLES AND MINERALS WHICH IN PARTICULAR CASES MAY BE HIGHLY SERVICEABLE TO THE HEALTH OF MANKIND WHEN SUCH VIRTUES ARE HAPPILY DISCOVERED THEY SHOULD BE MADE AS GENERALLY KNOWN AS POSSIBLE THAT ALL MAY PARTAKE THE BENEFIT NO FARTHER APOLOGY NEED BE OFFERED TO THIS ILLU STRIOUS S O C I E T Y FOR COMMUNICATING A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE SPEEDY RELIEF MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS HAVE FREQUENTLY RECEIVED IN A VERY TROUBLESOME AND OFTEN DANGEROUS DISORDER BY THE PARTICULAR VIRTUE AND EFFICACY OF A SHRUB WELL KNOWN AMONGST US THOUGH COMMONLY BUT LITTLE REGARDED FROM MY CHILDHOOD TILL WITHIN ABOUT TWELVE YEARS PAST I USED ALMOST CONSTANTLY UPON TAKING COLD TO BE SEIZED IMMEDIATELY WITH AN INFLAMMATION IN THE THROAT ATTENDED WITH GREAT SWELLING THROB BING AND SORENESS AND NOTWITHSTANDING BLEEDING AND PURGING TOGETHER WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GARGLES LINCTUSS AND ALL THE OTHER METHODS GENERALLY MADE USE OF IN SUCH CASES IT MOST COMMONLY WOULD TAKE ITS COURSE THAT IS IN ABOUT A WEEK OR TEN DAYS TIME IT WOULD SUPPURATE AND BREAK A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF FETID MATTER WOULD BE DISCHARGED AND THEN I SOON RECOVEREDDURING ITS CONTINUANCE I WAS656 WAS UNABLE TO SWALLOW ANY THING BUT WARM LIQUIDS AND EVEN THOSE NOT WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY AND PAIN BUT UPON ITS BREAKING I FOUND IMMEDIATE EASE THIS DISORDER ATTACKING ME FIVE OR SIX TIMES A YEAR AND SOMETIMES OFTENER AFFORDED BUT TOO FRE QUENT OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPERIENCING THAT ALL THE COMMON METHODS DID ME NO GOOD AT ALL BUT ON THE CONTRARY MADE MY UNEASINESS LAST THE LONGER BY RETARDING THE SUPPURATION WHICH OFTEN DETERMINED ME TO LEAVE IT WHOLLY TO NATURE WITH THE ASSISTANCE ONLY OF WARM BROTHS AND GRUELS BUT ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH A LEARNED AND INGENIOUS CLERGYMAN THE REVD MR WASHBOURNE VICAR OF EDMONTON AND ONE OF THE CANONS OF ST PAULS WHO TOLD ME THAT FROM MANY EXPERIMENTS ON HIMSELF AND OTHERS SCARCE EVER FAILING OF SUCCESS HE COULD ALMOST ASSURE ME OF A CERTAIN CURE IF AS SOON AS EVER I SHOULD PERCEIVE ANY SWEL LING OR SORENESS IN THE THROAT BEGIN I WOULD SWALLOW LEISURELY A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE JUICE OF BLACK CURRANTS  MADE INTO A JELLY OR IF THE JELLY COULD

ESQ F R S IN HIS MISCELLANIES PRINTED AT LONDON 1721 IN 8VO P 63 SAYS THAT A GENTLEWOMAN HAD HER SORE THROAT CURED BY A PULTESS OF BLUE CURRANTS THE EFFICACY OF THE JELLY OF BLACK CURRANTS IN CURING SORE THROATS HAS BEEN LONG KNOWN AMONG SEVERAL GOOD WOMEN WHO GIVE AWAY MEDICINES IN THE COUNTRY YET IT HAS BEEN HITHERTO SO OVERLOOKED BY PHYSICIANS AS NOT TO BE ORDERED TO BE KEPT IN THE APOTHECARIES SHOPS AND EVEN THE ROB OR JELLY OF ELDERBERRIES WHICH COMES UP TO THIS NEXT IN VIRTUE ALTHOUGH ORDERED IS KEPT BUT IN FEW SHOPS C M NOT657 NOT BE GOT A DECOCTION OF THE LEAVES IN MILK OR EVEN OF THE BARK IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN IN WINTER USED BY THE WAY OF GARGLE WOULD PROVE HE SAID A SPECIFIC FOR ALL INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS OF THE THROAT THOUGH I HAD NO GREAT FAITH I RESOLVED TO TRY THIS EASY REMEDY AND AS SOON AS BLACK CURRANTS COULD BE GOT CAUSED A QUANTITY OF THEIR JELLY TO BE MADE NOR WAS AN OCCASION OF TRYING IT LONG WANTING WHEN TO MY GREAT SURPRIZE AND JOY I FOUND ITS EFFECT BEYOND ANY THING I COULD IMAGINE FOR IN TWO OR THREE HOURS THE INFLAMMATION AND SWELLING INTIRELY VANISHED AND MY THROAT REMAINED AS EASY AS IF NOTHING AT ALL HAD HAPPENED FROM THAT TIME TILL VERY LATELY FOR A DOZEN YEARS TOGETHER THIS MEDICINE HAS NEVER FAILED ME ONCE BUT HAS ON NUMBERLESS TRIALS TAKEN AWAY THIS DIS ORDER FROM ME IN A FEW HOURS IT HAS LIKEWISE HAD THE SAME GOOD EFFECT ON MANY OF MY FRIENDS TO WHOM I HAVE AT DIFFERENT TIMES RECOMMENDED IT SO THAT SEVERAL OF THEM ARE NEVER NOW WITHOUT IT IN THEIR HOUSES BUT A DISAPPOINTMENT I LATELY IMAGINED I HAD MET WITH FROM THIS MEDICINE IS THE REASON OF MY LAYING BEFORE YOU THE FOLLOWING FACT UPON TAKING COLD ABOUT TEN WEEKS AGO I WAS SEIZED WITH AN INFLAMMATION IN MY THROAT ATTENDED WITH SORENESS AND THROBBING PAIN ON WHICH I APPLIED TO MY OLD REMEDY BUT WITHOUT THE USUAL SUCCESS FOR THOUGH I TOOK IT SEVERAL TIMES A DAY FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS TOGETHER THE DISORDER GREW CONTINU ALLY WORSE AND THE LEFT SIDE OF MY THROAT WAS SO VIOLENTLY INFLAMED AND PAINFUL AND SWELLED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO SWALLOW EVEN LI QUIDS658 QUIDS WITHOUT ABUNDANCE OF TROUBLE IN SHORT IT EXACTLY RESEMBLED THE SORE THROATS I USED TO BE AFFLICTED WITH BEFORE MY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MEDICINE AND THEREFORE I GAVE IT UP TO TAKE THE SAME COURSE IT WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO FORMERLY AFTER ABOUT A WEEK WHEN I HAD GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE COLLECTION OF MATTER AND I EXPECTED IT EVERY HOUR TO BREAK I WAS CALLED BY BUSINESS TO A RELATIONS HOUSE AT TOTTENHAM IN MIDDLE SEX WHERE BEING SCARCE ABLE TO GET DOWN A SINGLE DISH OF TEA MY FRIENDS WHO HAVE BEEN LONG ACQUAINTED WITH THE VIRTUES OF BLACK CURRANT JELLY INQUIRED WHEREFORE I HAD NOT APPLIED TO MY USUAL REMEDY I TOLD THEM THAT I HAD BUT TO NO PURPOSE AT ALL WHICH I KNEW NOT HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR UNLESS MINE BEING ABOVE TWO YEARS OLD TIME HAD DESTROYED ITS VIRTUE THEY SAID THEY HAD LATELY MADE SOME AND IMMEDI ATELY FETCHED A GLASS OF IT WHICH THEY PERSUADED ME TO MAKE USE OFI TOOK THREE OR FOUR SPOONFULS OF IT RATHER THROUGH CIVILITY THAN FROM ANY HOPE OF ITS DOING GOOD AT A TIME WHEN I EVERY MOMENT EXPECTED AND WISHED IT TO BREAK IN ABOUT AN HOURS TIME AS I SAT BY THE FIRESIDE I PERCEIVED A SORT OF DISAGREEABLE PUTRID SMELL WHICH I DID NOT MIND AT FIRST SUPPOSING IT SOMETHING ACCI DENTAL BUT FINDING A CONTINUANCE OR RATHER AN IN CREASE OF IT I BEGAN TO EXAMINE WHAT IT MIGHT BE OWING TO AND WAS CONVINCED AFTER I HAD CHANGED MY PLACE THAT IT PROCEEDED FROM MYSELF AND WAS REALLY THE SMELL OF MY OWN PERSPIRATION WHICH I FOUND SO MUCH INCREASED AS TO BECOME ALMOST A SWEAT AT THE SAME TIME FANCYING MY THROAT A LITTLE EASIER I TOOK SOME MORE OF THE JELLY I659 I CAME TO TOTTENHAM ABOUT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON AND BEGAN WITH THE JELLY ABOUT SIX AT SUPPER I WITH SOME DIFFICULTY GOT DOWN A LITTLE GRUEL AND WHEN I WENT TOBED DRANK SOME LINSEEDTEA SWEET ENED WITH SYRUP OF MULBERRIES  I SOON GOT TO SLEEP BUT WAKING AFTER SOME HOURS FOUND MYSELF IN A GENTLE BREATHING SWEAT ATTENDED WITH THE SAME UN PLEASANT PUTRID SMELL THE SWELLING IN MY THROAT WAS HOWEVER SENSIBLY DIMINISHED AND THE SORENESS MUCH ABATED AT WHICH BEING REJOICED I TOOK A MOUTHFUL OF THE JELLY THAT STOOD BY MY BEDSIDE AND COMPOSED MYSELF TO SLEEP AGAIN A GENTLE SWEAT CONTINUED DURING THE WHOLE NIGHT AND IN THE MORN ING THE SWELLING TO MY GREAT AMAZEMENT WAS QUITE REDUCED AND THE SORENESS SO INCONSIDERABLE THAT ABOUT TEN OCLOCK I EAT SOME TOAST WITH CHOCOLATE AND BY DINNERTIME HAD NO MORE REMAINS OF ANY DISORDER THAN IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN I AM VERY CERTAIN THE SWELLING WAS NOT DISCHARGED BY BREAKING FOR HAD IT BROKE EVEN IN MY SLEEP I MUST HAVE FOUND SOME ILL TASTE IN MY MOUTH AT WAKING WHEREAS I WAS NOT SENSIBLE OF ANY DISAGREE ABLE TASTE AT ALL BUT THE SMELL BEFOREMENTIONED WAS GREATLY OFFENSIVE TO ME WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE INTO THE BED DURING THE WHOLE TIME I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF THAT IS FOR ABOUT SEVENTEEN HOURS I MADE WATER BUT ONCE ONLY AND THEN IN A SMALL QUANTITY THE COLOUR OF IT WAS VERY HIGH AND IT SOON THREW DOWN AN EXCEEDING THICK SEDIMENT AS DID ALL I MADE FOR TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS THOUGH GRADUALLY CLEARING UP MORE AND MORE Q Q Q Q I660 I SHALL NOT PRESUME TO OFFER ANY OPINION AS TO THE MANNER THIS MEDICINE OPERATES BUT LEAVE IT TO BE CONSIDERED BY MORE PROPER JUDGES ONLY PERMIT ME TO OBSERVE THAT WERE THE VIRTUES OF SIMPLES DILIGENTLY INQUIRED INTO WE MIGHT PERHAPS DISCOVER MORE READY AND CERTAIN CURES FOR SOME DISTEMPERS THAN WHAT WE KNOW AT PRESENT THE BARBAROUS NEGROES MERELY BY TRIALS AND OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT BOTH POISONS AND COUNTERPOISONS ON WHICH IF OUR ACCOUNTS OF THEM BE TRUE THEY CAN DEPEND WITH CERTAINTY AND WE KNOW THAT THE SAVAGES IN AME RICA HAVE DISCOVERED BY THE SAME MEANS AND GENE ROUSLY TAUGHT US THE MEDICINAL EFFECTS OF THEIR IPE CACUANHA CONTRAYERVA PERUVIAN BARK AND SOME OTHER SIMPLES WHICH ARE ALMOST INFALLIBLE IN CURING THE DISORDERS OF THE CLIMATE WHERE THEY GROW NOR IS IT

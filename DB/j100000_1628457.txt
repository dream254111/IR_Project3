conditions which were eminently suitable to the de velopment of the parasitic form they re sisted its action perfectly though control plants which had not been cultivated in the ground infected by the attenuated form were killed very quickly From their ex periments the authors claim to have shown that the form of Botrytis cinerea inter mediate between the gonidial and the sterile form can make plants immune to the at tacks of the latter Researches of a somewhat kindred nature dealing with the infection of particular plants by specific fungi have been communi cated recently to this section by Professor Marshall Ward in his paper read last year on the bromes and their brown rust They brought to light many very important facts connected with the question of adaptive parasitism and immunity Few questions in vegetable physiology can compare in economic importance with these when we think of their possible development in re lation to agriculture I have now somewhat hurriedly surveyed certain parts of the field of vegetable physiology It has been impossible in an address like this to do more than indicate what seem to me some of the more impor tant problems awaiting investigation May we hope that all such work will be vigor ously conducted but that the conclusions reached will be scrutinized with the greatest care and subjected to repeated examina tion Great hindrances to the advance of the science resulted from dogmatic as sertions made by eminent men in the past their personal influence having led to their conclusions not altogether accurate being nevertheless almost universally accepted Many years subsequently these conclusions have needed reexamination the result be ing the destruction of a whole fabric that had been reared upon this unworthy foun dation I may close as I began by an ap peal to the younger school of botanists to take some of this work in hand and by assiduous and critical experiment and ob servation to contribute to the solution of the problems pressing upon us in this field J REYNOLDS GREEN CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY AMERICAN ORNITHOLOGISTS VNION THE Twentieth Congress of the Ameri can Ornithologists Union convened in Washington D C Monday evening No vember 17 The business meeting of the fellows was held at Dr Merriams resi dence and the public sessions commencing Tuesday November 18 and lasting three days were held at the U S National Mu seum Dr C Hart Merriam of Washington D C was reelected president Charles B Cory of Boston and C F Batchelder of Cambridge Mass vicepresidents John H Sage of Portland Conn secretary William Dutcher of New York City treasurer Frank M Chapman Ruthven Deane E W Nelson Witmer Stone Drs A K Fisher Jonathan Dwight Jr and Thos S Roberts members of the Council The expresidents of the Union Dr J A Allen and Messrs William Brewster D G Elliot and Robert Ridgway are ex officio members of the council Harry C Oberholser of Washington D C was elected a fellow Ernst Hartert of

Thirteen associates were elected to the class known as mem bers and eightyfour new associates were elected SCIENCE 938SCIENCE Mr Witmer Stone in his paper entitled A Glance at the Historical Side of the CheckList of North American Birds re ferred to the help accorded by the earlier ornithologists in making a checklist pos sible and gave in detail the number of species described by each Dr Allen traced the history of the present A O U checklist from its inception and spoke of its future Much discussion ensued and many in quiries were made regarding the protec tion of birds The report of the commit tee having this matter in charge showed that satisfactory results had been obtained during the past year and that interest in the preservation of wild bird life was not lacking at the present time Dr Bishop spoke of the slaughter by marketmen and milliners agents of the species found along the coast of North Carolina and Mr Dutcher remarked on the proposed legisla tive bills for the preservation of such birds Dr Palmer told of the immense number of ducks annually taken to the northern markets from the North Carolina coast He thought the upland as well as the shore birds needed protection Professor T Gilbert Pearson referred to the destruction of bobwhite in his state North Carolina and of the illegal methods used in trans porting them north Mr Chapman compared the birdlife of Gardiners Island N Y and Cobbs Island Va accompanying his remarks with lantern slides As a result of rigid protection birds are abundant on the former island while at the latter island for want of suitable protection they are nearly exterminated Mr George Spencer Morris gave many facts relating to the life of Edward Harris the friend of Audubon and read extracts from his unpublished journals It was an important contribution to the historical side of ornithology 939 The Union sustained a severe loss in the death of Major Jas C Merrill U S A a prominent fellow of the Union who died in October and of Chester Barlow a mem ber who died the present month Mr Barlow was also the leading spirit in the Cooper Ornithological Club of California The day following adjournment the members of the Union were invited by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to visit the National Zoological Park and many availed themselves of the privilege Secretary Langley received the visitors who were subsequently taken through the Park by Dr Frank Baker the Superin tendent The question of holding a special meet ing of the Union in California the coming year was referred to a committee with power

OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH IN the charter granted to the incorpora tors of the Institute of Technology forty one years ago they and their successors were made a body corporate for the pur pose of instituting a society of arts a mu seum of arts and a school of industrial science In addition the purpose and aim of the corporation was then declared to be to aid generally by suitable means the advancement development and practical application of science in connection with arts agriculture manufacture and com merce This intention to advance and to develop the practical applications of science has Extract from an announcement about to be i ssued by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology been steadily kept in view and the corpo ration and faculty of the Institute have striven constantly in the four decades of its history to advance the quality of in struction and to enlarge the facilities for laboratory practice The curriculum of studies offered to undergraduate students of the Institute has gradually changed with the growing demands of the indus trial life of the country New engineer ing courses have differentiated themselves fiom those originally established At its foundation the Institute offered but three distinct courses for engineerscivil me chanical and mining engineering Today it offers in addition to these courses in electrical engineering chemical engineer ing sanitary engineering and naval archi tecture and in several of these branches applications of science are employed which forty years ago were unknown Thus biology brings to the aid of the sanitary engineer today a technical knowledge ab solutely essential in his profession which was impossible forty years ago The demands of modern civilization call for engineers who can do more than keep abreast of the theory and practice of their profession They must be able to solve new problems and to advance the state of the art in which their work lies In ap plied science no less than in pure science there is need for research and for the de velopment of the research spirit Prob lems of immense practical importance are pressing for immediate solution Such questions as the cheapening of electric power the problem of longdistance trans mission the purification of streams and the sanitary engineering of great cities the numerous applications of chemical engineering to the arts furnish numerous problems of investigation whose solution affords at once the keenest intellectual ex ercise and the most practical and useful results The larger industrial and manu 0940 SCIENCE

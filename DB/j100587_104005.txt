J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,104005,THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF SPHERICAL MAPS OR SUCH AS ARE DELINEATED UPON PORTIONS OF A SPHERICAL SURFACE BY MR JOHN COLSON M A F R S,I206904,204 XI THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF SPHERICAL MAPS OR SUCH AS ARE DELINEATED UPON PORTIONS OF A SPHERICAL SURFACE BY MR JOHN COL SON M A F R S GEOGRAPHICAL MAPS AND HYDROGRAPHICAL CHARTS THOUGH THEY ARE REPRESENTATIONS OF A CONVEX SPHERICAL SURFACE YET WERE FIRST DELINEATED UPON PLANES AS BEING THE MOST EASY AND OBVIOUS THO NOT THE MOST NATURAL AND ACCURATE REPRESENTATIONS AND THEY WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY NEAR THE TRUTH WHEN THE PART OF THE EARTH OR SEAS TO BE DESCRIBED IS NOT OF A VERY LARGE EXTENT SUCH AS THESE HAVE BEEN USUALLY CALLED CHOROGRAPHICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL MAPS BUT WHEN THE MAP IS ANY THING GENERAL OR IS TO CONTAIN ANY LARGE TRACT OF THE EARTH OR SEAS SUPPOSE FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE WORLD AS THEY ARE CALLD THEN WHEN THEY ARE PROJECTED OR REPRESENTED UPON A PLANE THE PARTS MUST NECESSARILY BE DISTORTED ONE WAY CONTRACTED BEYOND THE TRUTH ANOTHER WAY DILATED SO AS TO GIVE NO JUST IDEA OF THE WHOLE NOR CAN THIS DI STORTION BE POSSIBLY AVOIDED WHEN ANY CONSIDERABLE PART OF A SPHERICAL SURFACE BY ANY PROJECTION WHAT EVER IS TO BE REPRESENTED UPON A PLANE TIS TRUE THIS DISTORTION IS ALWAYS REGULAR AND ACCORDING TO CERTAIN LAWS SO THAT KNOWING THE NATURE OF THE PROJECTION IT MAY TOLERABLY WELL BE ALLOWD FOR BUT TO DO THIS SCIENTIFICALLY AND AS IT ONGHT TO BE DONE REQUIRES MUCH SKILL AND ACCURACY IN THE MAKER205 MAKER AS WELL AS GOOD PROFICIENCE AND EXPERIENCE IN THE PERUSER AND THEREFORE NOT SO PROPER FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO LEARNERS IN THE RUDIMENTS OF GEO GRAPHY YOUNG MINDS ARE APT TO RECEIVE WRONG NO TIONS AND PREJUDICES FROM THEM AT LEAST CANNOT BE RIGHTLY AND EASILY INSTRUCTED BY THEM TO OBVIATE THIS INCONVENIENCE GEOGRAPHERS HAVE CONTRIVED AND CONSTRUCTED THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE ON WHICH THEY ENDEAVOUR TO DELINEATE ALL THE PARTS OF THE EARTHS SURFACE IN THEIR NATURAL STATE AS TO LON GITUDE LATITUDE DISTANCE BEARING MAGNITUDE C WHICH BEING A TRUE AND GENUINE REPRESENTATION OF THE WHOLE SUPERFICIES OF THE EARTH AS FAR AS IT IS YET KNOWN IS THE BEST ADAPTED FOR CONVEYING JUST NO TIONS TO YOUNG MINDS AND FOR PREVENTING ALL FALSE CONCEPTIONS AND PREPOSSESSIONS AFTER THE FIRST RU DIMENTS OF GEOGRAPHY HAVE BEEN IMBIBED FROM HENCE THEY WILL BE THEN PREPARED FOR THE USE OF PLAIN MAPS AND THEY WILL AFTERWARDS FIND THAT LARGE PROJECTIONS OF PARTICULAR COUNTRIES KINGDOMS AND PROVINCES IN PLANO WILL BE OF EXCELLENT SER VICE TO THEM FOR THEIR FARTHER IMPROVEMENT IN THIS USEFUL AND NECESSARY SCIENCE NOR WILL THEY NOW BE IN ANY DANGER OF BEING MISLED BY SUCH MAPS THO THEY ARE NOT SO JUST AND NATURAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE EARTHLY GLOBE NOW THE SAME CONVENIENCIES THAT MAY BE DERIVED FROM THE WHOLE GLOBE MAY IN PROPORTION BE HAD FROM ANY NOTABLE PORTIONS OF IT AS AN HEMISPHERE A QUADRANT A SECTANT AN OCTANT OR OTHER PART BUT WITH THIS ADVANTAGE BESIDES THAT THESE PARTIAL SPHERICAL MAPS WILL NOT ONLY BE MUCH LESS CUMBER SOME AND MORE MANAGEABLE THAN A WHOLE GLOBE D D BUT206 BUT MAY BE MADE MUCH MORE ACCURATE AND PARTICULAR AS BEING CAPABLE OF BEING FORMD TO A MUCH LARGER DI AMETER THAN A GLOBE CAN CONVENIENTLY BE MADE TO THE MAPS MAY FIRST BE PRINTED UPON A PLANE AS IS USUAL IN THE COMMON GLOBES AND THEN PASTED UPON THIN CONVEX SHELLS OF PASTBOARD FORMD TO THE INTEN DED RADIUS THE FORMING OF THESE SPHERICAL COATS OF PASTBOARD WILL BE A MATTER OF NO GREAT DIFFICULTY EVEN TO AS LARGE A DIAMETER AS SHALL BE DESIRED BUT THE CHIEF ART WILL BE REQUIRED IN PROJECTING THE MAPS IN PLANO AFTER THE SIMPLEST AND EXACTEST MANNER SO AS THAT THEY MAY ADAPT THEMSELVES WITH AS LITTLE ERROR AS POSSIBLE TO A SPHERICAL SURFACE FOR A PLANE SURFACE CANNOT BE CONVERTED INTO A SPHERICAL SURFACE WITHOUT SOME ERROR THE BEST METHOD OF DOING THIS WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE ERROR I THINK WILL BE AS FOLLOWS INSTEAD OF THE USUAL SLIPS OR GUSSETSAS IS THE MANNER OF GLOBEMAKERS WHICH ARE COMPREHENDED BETWEEN TWO MERIDIANS AT SOME DISTANCE AND ARE FORMD ONLY TENTATIVELY AND MECHANICALLY WITHOUT THE HELP OF ANY JUST THEORY WE MAY DIVIDE THE WHOLE SPHERI CAL SURFACE INTO PARALLEL PORTIONS OR ZONES THAT IS INTO PARTS TERMINATED BY TWO PARALLELS TO THE EQUA TOR AT THE DISTANCE SUPPOSE OF TEN DEGREES AS IF THE FIRST OF THESE PORTIONS OR ZONES WERE AT THE EQUATOR ITSELF AND EXTENDED TO FIVE DEGREES OF LA TITUDE ON EACH SIDE OF THAT CIRCLE THE SECOND ZONE WOULD BE AT THE PARALLEL OF TEN DEGREES OF LATITUDE AND WOULD EXTEND TO FIVE DEGREES OF LATITUDE ON ONE SIDE AND TO FIFTEEN DEGREES OF LATITUDE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT PARALLEL AND SO OF THE SUCCEEDING ZONES NOW207 NOW WE MAY CONCEIVE THE FIRST OF THESE PORTIONS OR ZONES TO BE CONVERTED FROM A SPHERICAL SURFACE TO A PLANE SURFACE IN THIS MANNER WITHOUT SENSIBLE ERROR LET THE MIDDLE LINE OF THIS ZONE THAT IS THE EQUATOR CONTINUE IN ITS SITUATION AND LET THE SEGMENTS OF THE MERIDIANS ON EACH SIDE BE CON CEIVED TO UNBEND THEMSELVES GRADUALLY TILL THEY ARE EXTENDED INTO RIGHT LINES PERPENDICULAR TO THE EQUA TOR THEN WILL THAT WHICH WAS BEFORE A ZONE OR PORTION OF A SPHERICAL SURFACE WITH A SMALL ALTERA TION BECOME A PORTION OF A CYLINDRICAL SURFACE CIR CUMSCRIBED ABOUT THE SPHERE WHOSE BREADTH IS EVERY WHERE EQUAL TO TEN DEGREES OF THE SPHERE AND WHOSE CIRCUMFERENCE IS EQUAL TO THE EQUATOR AND THUS EVERY PARALLEL TO THE EQUATOR AS FAR AS THAT OF FIVE DEGREES OF LATITUDE ON EACH SIDE WILL BE STRETCHD AND EXTENDED INTO A CIRCLE AS LARGE AS THE EQUATOR BUT THEY WILL ALL KEEP THE SAME DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER AND FROM THE EQUATOR THAT THEY HAD BEFORE THIS EXTENSION OR ALTERATION WILL BE EVERY WHERE REGULAR AND UNIFORM AND WILL BE BUT VERY LITTLE EVEN WHERE IT IS MOST FOR THE LEAST OF THESE CIRCLES WHICH IS THE PARALLEL OF FIVE DEGREES OF LATITUDE HAS THE SAME PROPORTION TO THE CIRCLE IT IS STRETCHD TO OR THE EQUATOR AS THE SINE OF 85 DE GREES HAS TO THE RADIUS OR AS 9961947 TO 10000000 WHICH APPROACHES VERY NEAR TO A RATIO OF EQUALITY AND NOW IT WILL BE EASILY CONCEIVED THAT WITHOUT UNDERGOING ANY OTHER ALTERATION OR DISTORTION THIS PORTION OF A CYLINDRICAL SURFACE MAY BE RECTIFIED OR EXTENDED INTO A PLANE PARALLCLOGRAM WHOSE LENGTH WILL BE EQUAL TO THAT OF THEEQUATOR AND WHOSEBREADTH WILL BE EQUAL TO ANARCH OF 10DEG OF THE SAMEEQUATOR D D 2 AND208 AND CONSEQUENTLY BY AN OPERATION THAT WILL BE JUST THE REVERSE OF THIS IF UPON A PLANE WE DELI NEATE SUCH A PARALLELOGRAM AS THIS WE MAY THEN LAY DOWN ALL THE PLACES THAT ARE CONTAIND IN IT VERY EX ACTLY IN THEIR PROPER SITUATION OF LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE AND THEN APPLY ITS MIDDLE LINE OR EQUA TOR TO THAT OF A GLOBE OF A DUE MAGNITUDE WHICH WILL THEN BECOME A PORTION OF A CYLINDRICAL SURFACE CIRCUMSCRIBED ABOUT THE GLOBE THEN BY PRESSING IT CLOSE TO THE BODY OF THE GLOBE WE SHALL CAUSE IT TO CONTRACT ITSELF A VERY LITTLE BUT REGULARLY WHICH CONTRACTION WILL BE ONLY ACCORDING TO LONGITUDE AND NOT AT ALL ACCORDING TO LATITUDE AND THEN THE CYLINDRICAL SURFACE WILL BE CHANGED INTO THAT OF A SPHERE AND WILL BECOME THE FIRST SPHERICAL ZONE BEFORE DESCRIBED WITH ALL ITS DELINEATIONS IN THEIR DUE POSITION WITHOUT SENSIBLE ERROR IN LIKE MANNER IN THE SECOND SPHERICAL PORTION OR ZONE COMPREHENDED BETWEEN THE PARALLELS OF FIVE AND FIFTEEN DEGREES WHOSE MIDDLE LINE IS THE PA RALLEL OF TEN DEGREES WE MAY CONCEIVE THE SEG MENTS OF THE MERIDIANS TO UNBEND GRADUALLY ON EACH SIDE AND TO EXTEND THEMSELVES INTO TANGENT RIGHT LINES WHICH THEREFORE WILL FORM A SEGMENT OF A CONICAL SURFACE STILL TOUCHING THE GLOBE IN THE PA RALLEL OF TEN DEGREES OF LATITUDE THE AXIS OF THIS CONE WILL COINCIDE WITH THE PROLONGED AXIS OF THE GLOBE AND THE SIDE OF THE CONE WHICH IS TO BE ESTIMATED FROM THE VERTEX TO THE CIRCLE OF CON TACT WILL BE THE COTANGENT OF THE LATITUDE OR THE TANGENT OF 80 DEGREES NOW THIS PORTION OF A CONICAL SURFACE MAY EASILY BE CONCEIVED TO BE UN ROLLD OR TO BE EXPANDED INTO A PLANE SURFACE WITH OUT209 OUT UNDERGOING ANY OTHER ALTERATION AND THEN IT WILL BECOME A PORTION OF A SECTOR OF A CIRCLE WHICH PORTION WILL HAVE FOR ITS LENGTH OR MIDDLE LINE AN ARCH OF A CIRCLE DESCRIBED WITH THE AFORESAID TAN GENT AS A RADIUS WHOSE LENGTH WILL BE THE SAME AS THE PARALLEL OF CONTACT AND ITS BREADTH WILL BE EQUAL TO AN ARCH OF THE EQUATOR OF TEN DEGREES AS BEFORE THIS SEGMENT OF A SECTOR OF A CIRCLE SO PRODUCED MAY THEREFORE BE EASILY DESCRIBED IN PLANO AND WITHIN IT MAY BE INSERTED ALL THE PLACES BELONG ING TO IT ACCORDING TO THEIR LONGITUDE AND LATI TUDE THEN IT MUST BE APPLIED TO THE GLOBE SO AS THAT ITS MIDDLE LINE SHALL COINCIDE WITH THE PARALLEL OF TEN DEGREES THEN BY PRESSING IT MAY BE BENT TO THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE EVERY MERIDIAN TO ITS RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVE BY WHICH IT WILL UNIFORM LY CONTRACT A LITTLE ACCORDING TO LONGITUDE BUT NOT AT ALL ACCORDING TO LATITUDE AND THUS THE GLOBE WILL BE COVERD AS FAR AS 15 DEGREES OF LATITUDE THE NEXT ZONE OR THAT BELONGING TO THE PARALLEL OF 20 DEGREES MAY BE THUS CONSTRUCTED A PRIORI UPON A PLAIN PAPER WITH RADIUS EQUAL TO THE TAN GENT OF 70 DEGREES DESCRIBE AN ARCH WHOSE LENGTH IS EQUAL TO THAT OF THE PARALLEL OF 20 DEGREES AS ALSO TWO OTHER CONCENTRICK ARCHES ON EACH SIDE AT A DISTANCE FROM THE MIDDLE ARCH EQUAL TO AN ARCH OF FIVE DEGREES THIS WILL BE THE REQUIRED SEGMENT OF THE CIRCULAR SECTOR IN WHICH ARE TO BE INSERTED ALL THE PLACES BELONGING TO IT ACCORD ING TO THEIR LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE THEN THE MIDDLE LINE OR ARCH IS TO BE APPLYD TO THE PARALLEL OF 20 DEGREES UPON THE GLOBE AND THE SEGMENT OF THE CONICAL SURFACE THENCE ARISING IS TO BE DULY CON TRACTED210 TRACTED AS BEFORE OR PRESSD CLOSE TO THE GLOBE BY WHICH MEANS THIS ZONE WILL ALSO BE COMPLEATED AND IN THE SAME MANNER WE ARE TO PROCEED TO THE SUCCEEDING ZONES TILL THE WHOLE GLOBE IS COVERD AND THE METHOD WILL NOT DIFFER IN ANY MATERIAL CIR CUMSTANCE IF INSTEAD OF A WHOLE GLOBE WE ARE TO CONSTRUCT ANY PART OF IT ONLY OR WHAT I HERE CALL A SPHERICAL MAP TO REDUCE THIS THEORY TO PRACTICE AND AS A SPE CIMEN OF SPHERICAL MAPS I HAVE CONSTRUCTED A TER RESTRIAL HEMISPHERE TO A DIAMETER OF NEAR 15 INCHES TO WHICH I HAVE GIVEN THE NAME OF THE BRITISH HEMISPHERE BECAUSE IT HAS GREATBRITAIN IN THE CENTER OR RATHER AT ITS VERTEX IT IS THEREFORE ADAPTED TO THE MERIDIAN AND HORIZON OF LONDON AND EXHIBITS ONE HALF OF THE EARTHS SURFACE AS IT LIES ROUND ABOUT THIS CITY WHICH IS VASTLY THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE WHOLE EARTHS SUPERFICIES THE LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE OF PLACES ARE HERE EASILY KNOWN BY INSPECTION AND THEIR BEARING AND DISTANCES MAY BE NEARLY ESTIMATED AND ALL THE DELINEATIONS ARE AS ACCURATE AND PARTICULAR AS THIS SMALL RADIUS WOULD PERMIT I CONCEIVE THEREFORE IT MAY BE NO UNFIT INSTRUMENT FOR INSTRUCTING BEGINNERS OR FOR INITIATING YOUNG MINDS IN THE FIRST RUDIMENTS OF GEOGRAPHY F I N I S

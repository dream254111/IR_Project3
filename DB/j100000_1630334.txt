with the low muchbranched shrub known as the sand cherry Prunus pumtla and bear ing small fruits which have a thin flesh Prob ably few of them are familiar with the western sand cherry Prunus bessey which grows on the prairies and great plains from blallitoba and Minnesota to Nebraska and Kansas rShe latter has a much larger shortstalked cherry which has a colored juicy flesh The plants of the two species are much alike but there are constant differences in habit and fruit suffl eiellt to warrant their separation For prac tical purposes the two are very distinct the western species even in the wild state being valuable for culinary purposes In a recent bulletin No 8X of the North Dakota Experiment Station Professor Han son makes a discussion of this fruit giving the results of his experiments extellding over fourteen or fifteen years These may be sum marized as follows t It is exceedingly variable in the size and cuality of its fruit but all forms are accept able for culinary use 2 Erom them 100 varietles have been se lected and are now under propagation Some of these bear fruit from three fourths to sevell eighths inches in diameter and of a quality acceptable for eating without cooking 3 It hybridizes readily with at least three other species 4 Seedlings bear fruit in the third year b  After fruiting many thousands of seed lings it appears reasonable to believe that in this species we have a bush cherry that can be raised to advantage upon the most exposed prairies As to the present value of this species Pro fessor Hansen says 1  It is a native northwestern prairie fruit worthy of being tamed and transferred to the small frtlit garden 2  It is yet in the early stages of develop ment too much must not be expected at first 3  Even unselected seedlings are

it is the opinion of this committee 1 that this science should be taught in high schools for the benefit of pupils who will have no other opportunity of acquiring general knowl edge of animals and 2 that zoology thus taught from the point of vlew of general sec ondary education should have recognition as a collegeentrance option in order that pu pils who can not decide to go to college before the close of highschool work may not be held deficient in credits because zoology was elected But although thus recognizing zool ogy from the standpoint of secondary educa tion this committee wishes to emphasize the opinion that zoology is not one of the most desirable subjects as preparation for college and that the physical sciences should first of all be recommended to pupils who expect to go to college In reaching these conclusions the commit tee has not failed to consider the value of general acquaintance with common animals and with the essential principles of the ele mentary physiology and hygiene of the human body but these are commonly taught in the years below the second of high school and work in these loJwer years does not in the case of other subjects closely concern the question of collegeentrance options These preliminary statements will make it clear that the following suggestions for a scheme of collegeentrance credits in zoology are intended by this committee simply to pro vide for crediting the zoology which should be elective in every good general high school but not to advocate the subject as one which from the college standpoint is desirable in preparation for college In other words this committee is simply recommending that zool ogy studied as part of a liberal secondary education intended primarily to prepare for life should be recognized as preparing for en trance to college the minor question of prep aration for entrance to college courses in zoology being here laid aside General Staternent of Opt1onsa One point option To count as one unit or point in thirteen to fifteen required for entrance to college This should consist of one yearsof at least five hours per week devoted to study of zoology as indicated in outline of course given below b Halfpoint option one point in biol ogy To count as one half unit in thirteen to fifteen required only when a half unit of botany taken in the same continuous course is offered to complete a full Ullit in biological science A half year of zoology independent of botany should not be accepted A twopoint option is not recommended because more than one full year in zoology is extreme specialization which no secondary school can properly undertake Outt1ne for the OnePo1nt Opt1on 1n Zoology The following outline includes the principles of zoology which are indispensable to a gen eral survey of the science It is not intended to indicate order of study of the topicsthis must be left to the teacher and the textbook With little modification the courses presented in general books such as Needhams Klengs leys Kelloggs and Coltons revised cover the ground outlined below t The general natural history including general external structure in relation to adap tations life histories geographical range re lations to other plants and animals and eco nomic relations of at least one animal of each rominent order of vertebrates and one of each prominent class of invertebrates so far as representatives of these groups are obtain able in the locality where the course is given Tn the case of arthropods pupils should become familiar with common crustaceans spiders myriapods and insects representing at least five orders Actual examination of commo animals with reference to the above points should be supplemented by reading giving naturalhistory information equivalent to that in recent books by Davenport Jordan  Heath or Kingsley 2 The classification of animals into phyla and leading classes except the modern subdi visions of the worms and the great charac teristics of these groups In the case of in  A large part of this naturalhistory informa tion will be gained from the naturestudy of the elementary school and from the course often given in the first year of high school852 SCIENCE N S VOL XX NO 820 sects and vertebrates the characteristics of the prominent orders The teaching of classi fication should be by practical work so as to train the pupil to recognize animals and to point out the chief taxonomic characteristics The meaning of species genera and larger groups should be developed by constructive practical work with representatives of insect or vertebrate orders 3 The general plan of internal structure not the anatomical minutise of one verte brate preferably frog or fish in general com parison with human body an arthropod pref erably a decapod an annelid earthworm or Nereis a ccelenterate hydroid hydra or seaanemone a protozoon a ciliate and amceba when possible In place of any of above types not locally available there may be substituted a second vertebrate an insect or an echinoderm Tissues should be exam ined first with the unaided eye in such a structure as a frogs leg and then with a mi croscope demonstrate the relations of cells and intercellular substance in epithelium and cartilage and if possible in other tissues The functions of the chief tissues and their positions in the body of a vertebrate should be pointed out 4 a The general physiology of above types involving the essentials of digestion absorption circulation respiration cellmet abolism secretion exeretion and nervous func tions This should apply comparatively the essentials of elementary work in human phys iology see chapters 8 9 and 10 in Martins  Human Body Briefer Course  Demon strations and experiments such as are sug gested in highschool textbooks on human physiology should be introduced or recalled if not previously well presented in elementary physiology in connection with the discussion of the chief functions As far as practicable structure and function should be studied together b Comparison of the general lifeproc esses in animals and plants in connection with botany if zoology is Arst studied

features of embryological development in a fish or frog and the general cellular nature not centro somes and the like of germcells fertilization and cell division in developing eggs should as far as possible be demonstrated and briefly described Also the most interesting features of development should be pointed out in the case of other animals studied The limited microscopic work suggested above might all be carried out with only one microscope for demonstrations 6 The prominent evidences of relationship suggesting evolution within such groups as the decapods the insects and the vertebrates should be demonstrated A few facts indi cating the struggle for existence adaptation to environment variations of individuals and mans selective induence should be pointed out but the factors of evolution and the dis cussion of its theories should not be attempted 7 Some leading facts regarding the epoch making discoveries of biological history and the careers of such eminent naturalists as Darwin Huxley Pasteur and Agassiz should be presented The above outline of a course in general zoology should be developed on the basis of a course of laboratory study guided by defi nite directions This should be supplemented by the careful reading of at least one modern elementary textbook in general zoology At least two thirds of the time should be devoted to the practical studies of the laboratory If good naturestudies have not preceded the course in highschool zoology pupils should be encouraged to do supplementary work in the line of natural history A notebook with carefully labeled outline drawings of the chief structures studied and with notes on demonstrations and in explanation of draw ings with dates and an index must be sub mitted properly certified by the teacher at the time of the examination It will be graded as one third of the examination The question whether a course as outlined above should admit students to the second college course in zoology is one which must be answered by each college for itself It i8SCIENCE 853 DECEMBER 16 1904 Dartmouth The main part of the building is 102 x bl feet on the ground plan and this part consists of basement three

try all sorts of fool experiments then in view of the infinite multiplicity of things which they might have tried what is the probability that they would have discov ered all or nearly all of the fundamentally new facts which twenty years ago were yet to be brought to light According to the theory of probability this chance is practically nil Let us put with this result the further fact that for many hundred years men had been looking at phenomena with care and had not found the important facts discovered in this twentyyear period Then in view of all this we can only conclude that it is extremely probable that there is yet an unlimited or at least a very great number of fundamental facts still to be discovered We can hardly refuse to draw the further conclusion that all we know at present is only a mere fragment of what we shall ultimately find out We can indicate the immediate prospect nore precisely by a consideration of the pres sent state of physics which I believe now stands in an enviable position with respect to all science and all philosophyin fact with respect to every body of doctrine whose de velopment makes for human progress In re cent years it has undergone a marvelous re juvenation into the detail of which we can not now enter It requires no eye of prophecy to see that this is certain to make itself felt in valuable advances in astronomy and geol ogy and to lead the way to new and funda mental conquests in chemistry and biology All branches of the sciences of phenomena should sit at the feet of the new physics in order to get in touch with her most recent dis coveries and to carry them over to their con sequences in other special domains of re search All indications point to magnificent con quests of research in the immediate future and for many years to come An analysis of the past gives us a strong assurance that there are many important things yet to be dis covered The progress of the preceding de cade shows that we have in hand tools that have been effective and we can hardly sup pose that they have just now finished their work when we consider the sort of achieve ments which have just been made Notwith standing that the war in Europe will cut off many young men of enthusiasm and power and hinder the work of all investigators on that continent it is yet true that there is an enthusiastic body of workers especially in America still carrying on their silent con quests which will take a place alongside the great achievements of the race It is a pleas ure to know that there is such an organization as this society to foster a work of this sort I am glad that so many of us have entered upon the undertaking already and I hope that young men and women of promise will see a possibility of labor toward the good of the whole future of mankind and will lay their lives and their energies upon the altar of service in science R D CARMICHAEL THE PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY VITALISM VERSUS MECHANISM IN comparison with mathematicians and physicists biologists have contributed little to philosophical literature notwithstanding the close relations existing between their science and philosophy The most notable instance of recent years has been Driesch whose attempts at philosophical commentary and interpreta tion seem however to have given on the whole little satisfaction to either biologists or philos ophers Bergson the biological philosopher as Driesch calls himbases much of his doc trine on biological data and the use of such data appears to be becoming more frequent among philosophers Lately professed biol ogists have shown somewhat more tendency to enter the field of philosophical discussion and it is remarkable that when they do so they often adopt a vitalistic point of view Haldanes  Mechanism Life and Personality is one recent illustration of this tendency and the present book of Johnstones is another 1  The Philosophy of Biology by Jamne Johnstone DSe Cambridge University Press 1914 840 SCIENCEDECEMBER 11 1914 As the author himself explains the point of view and methods of treatment are largely those suggested by Driesch and Bergson The book is not long there are eight chapters en titled respectively the Conceptual World the Organism as a Mechanism the Activities of the Organism the Vital Impetus the Indi vidual and the Species Transformism the Meaning of Evolution the Organic and the Inorganic there is also an appendix with a brief account of the chief principles of ener getics In the table of contents is given a concise yet complete and connected summary of each chapter This makes it unnecessary for the reviewer to summarize the whole book and this review will be confined chiefly to a criticism of the authors main contentions and especially of the arguments by which he seeks to support his vitalistic thesis The first chapter discusses the relation of conceptual reasoning to reality The author agrees with Bergson in regarding intellect as essentially a biological function which reacts in a characteristic manner on the flux of real ity and dissociates this more or less arbitrarily into detached elements the aim of this dis sociation is practicalnamely to facilitate definite or effective action on the part of the organism Scientific method follows an essen tially similar plan our scientific descriptions and formulations of natural processes are con ceptual schemata their correspondence with real nature is inevitably inexact they neces sarily simplify and diagrammatize In reality however nature can not be regarded as a com posite of separate processes individually sus ceptible of exact description in intellectual terms and interconnected in ways which are similarly definite and quantitatively deter minable it is rather a continuous or fluxlike unitary activity exhibiting a progressive and irreversible trend hence actual duration is distinct from the conceptual time of physicists Now the intellect in making its characteristic conceptual transformation neglects or ignores or even falsifies much of the essential char acter of reality This is how it becomes pos sible to view the living organism as a mechan ism the physiologist substitutes for the real living organism the conception of a system of physicochemical processes conceived as inter connected in a definite way by doing so he is enabled to view the organism as essentially a physicochemical mechanism but we must note that the conceptual elements out of which he builds up his scientific view of the organism inevitably determine the nature of this end conception which is physicochemical or mechanistic only because his method does not permit him to regard the organism as any thing but a summation or integration of the physicochemical processes that form the ele ments of his synthesis As a result however he really misses what is most distinctive of living beings and reaches a point of view which is not only inadequate for scientific purposesas shown by the failure of physico chemical analysis in the case of many vital processesbut in its very nature far removed from the actuality itself This is the fundamental criticism which the author makes of the accepted scientific meth ods of investigating lifephenomena In the remainder of his book he interprets the char acteristics of the organism and of the evolu tionary process from this general or Berg sonian point of view He sees operative in life a distinctive agency corresponding to the elan vital of Bergson or the entelechy of Driesch which acts typically in a direction contrary to that characteristic of inorganic processes these latter tend toward homogeneity and dissipation of energy in living organisms on the contrary evolution tends toward the pro duction of diversity and the tendency of en tropy to strive toward a maximum may be compensated or even reversed by vital activity Life when we regard it from the point of view of energetics appears as a tendency which is opposed to that which we see to be characteristic of inorganic processes    The effect of the movement which we call inorganic is toward the abolition of diversities while that which we call life is toward the maintenance of diversities They are movements which are opposite in their direction page 314 It is here that the authors views become most seri ously open to scientific attack the evidence SCIENCE 841N S VOL XL No 1041 that the second law of thermodynamics does not always apply to lifeprocesses is certainly inadequate there is exact experimental evi dence that the first law that of conservation holds for organisms and the storing of solar energy by chlorophyll is in no sense evidence that the second law is evaded There seems in fact to be a fundamental misconception in this part of the authors argument Ie holds that life may play the part of the Maxwellian demon under appropriate circumstances page 118 and defends this view on the ground that the laws of molecular physics are statistical in their nature and might be different if it were possible to control the movements of indi vidual molecules such control it is implied is possible to the vital entelechy It seems to the reviewer however that the application of the second law to gases or solutions implies simply a tendency of the freely moving mol ecules to uniform distribution the resulting homogeneity can be prevented only by adding energy to or abstracting it from part of the system even Maxwells demon has to work a partition which resists the impact of the faster moleculesa consideration which shows that any coordination or sorting of molecules would in itself involve the performance of work Johnstones supposition however is that the vital entelechy can without altering the total energy of the system control or direct the otherwise uncoordinated motions of the indi vidual molecules and that the purposive or directed character of the individual organisms life and also of the whole organic or evolu tionary process is conditional on the existence of such an agency and is indeed the character istic expression of its activity He thus main tains in effect that physiological processes are unintelligible unless we can assume the existence of some such directive agency pecu liar to life which can vary the nature inten sity and direction of the physicochemical proc esses and coordinate them in the interest of the organism This entelechy is what imparts their distinctive quality to lifephenomena It has long seemed to the reviewer that fail ures or deficiencies in the physiological anal ysis of complex or delicately adjusted functions form no sufficient ground for rejecting such methods of investigation as in their nature inadequate Vitalists however are fond of this kind of attack and both Haldane and Johnstone adduce instances which they believe make it incredible that physicochemical proc esses unguided by an entelechy could ever form the basis of vitality At present our knowledge of the physiology of embryonic development and of certain types of form regulation is especially defective and such phe nomena are cited more frequently than any others as proving the inadequacy of physico chemical analysis Drieschs logical proof of vitalism quoted in the present book is an instance of this tendency even relatively simple processes like muscular contraction and nerve conduction remain largely mysterious and we find also scepticism as to the possibility of any satisfactory account of these processes in physicochemical terms cf page 100 of the present book A twofold reply to this type of vitalistic argument may be given First it is to be noted that the failure of physicochemical anal ysis is often due to mere complexity of condi tion But complexity as such does not introduce any essentially new problems it simply makes more difficult and may for a time make impossible the task of analysis Provided that the more elementary processes forming a complex process are characterized by constancy in their nature and in the condi tions of their occurrence any degree of com plexity in the total process is possible Ordi nary experience with complex artificial sys tems of a mechanical or other kind verifies this contention we find that there is no limit other than that set by practical expediency to the complexity of a system whose component parts operate and interact in a constant manner In all such cases smaller and simpler parts are taken as units from which higher compound units are built up and these second ary units are then similarly utilized for the construction of more complex systems these may be still further combined and so on The one indispensable condition is that there should be an essential invariability in the operation 842 SCIENCEDECEMBER 11 1914 and interaction of the parts of the system Similarly with life and its manifestations the complexity of organisms and of organic proc esses so far from making us despair of the adequacy of physicochemical analysis in deal ing with vital phenomena seems in fact to the reviewer the surest witness to their essential adequacy For these vital processes however complex and mysterious are unfailingly con stant in their normal manifestation one has only to reflect on what is continually happen ing in the body of a healthy man in order to realize this and the stability of conditions thus shown surely has the same basis as have the stability and constancy of the simpler non vital processes which we everywhere find as components of the vital The basis of this stability is simply the exactitude with which natural processes repeat themselves under identical conditions2 If this were not the case how could a physicochemical system of the vast complexity of e g the human organism ever exhibit stable existence or constant action It is impossible to doubt that the constancy with which complex physiological processes operate is conditional on the con stancy of the simpler component processes those which form the subjectmatter of physico chemical science Constancy in the char acter mode of action and interconnection of the component substances and processes is evi dently indispensable to the constancy or stabil ity of the product of their integration the living organism We find in fact that mys terious and unintelligible physiological proc esses e g the regeneration of the lens in the eye of a salamander recur under appropriate conditions with the same constancy as the simplest and most intelligible say the forma tion of a retinal image by that same lens It is clear that if we admit the adequacy of physicochemical methods in the one case we must be prepared to do so in the other Second it is to be noted that the organic 2 Just why there is such repetition is rather a philosophical than a scientific question but it seems probable that it is at bottom an expression of the homogeneity of the conditions of natural existence space and time processes show evidence by their very limita tions that the underlying mechanisms are strictly physicochemical in character Thus vitalists call especial attention to the instances of development and formregulation which have so far baffled all attempts at physico chemical analysis Does not this mean Johnstone asks that in biology we observe the working of factors which are not physico chemical ones  The limits to the regulative power are less frequently cited by vitalists yet surely evidence of this kind is equally relevant Why if an entelechy can restore the amputated arm of a salamander can not it perform a similar miracle in the case of a man The fact is that nothing is proved by citing such cases But on the whole they seem clearly to imply that the properties of the organism are throughout the properties of physicochemical systems differing from in organic systems simply in their complexity The reviewer knows of no facts which viewed without prepossession necessitate or even unequivocally favor the contrary view Those vitalists who maintain that material systems are incapable without the aid of an entelechy of developing the characteristics of lifeand who even hold that fundamental physical laws like the second principle of energetics are evaded by organismsmust adduce evidence of a less doubtful kind in support of their thesis The peculiarities which organisms ex hibit appear to the reviewer to lead to precisely the contrary conclusions and to indicate that stable and constantly acting physicochemical systems may exhibit a degree of complication both of composition and of behavior to which literally no limits can be assigned Another mode of reasoning popular among vitalists and equally fallacious from the phys icochemical standpoint is that an entelechy can without the performance of work guide or coordinate toward a definite end processes which themselves require the performance of work This view implies that in the organism molecular movement may be directed retarded or accelerated at the will of the entelechy But in Newtons first law of motion it is surely made clear that any deviation In the move SCIENCE 843N S VOL XL No 1041 ment of a particle from a straight line or any retardation or acceleration of its motion in volves work in precisely the same sense as does the initiation of the movement Now it is evident that guidance or regulation of the sequence of events in any material system must involve one or other of these kinds of processes In other words it is physically impossible for any agency to modify the proc esses in any material system without modify ing the energytransfers in that system and this can be done only by the introduction of compensating or reinforcing factors of some kindi e by altering the energycontent of the systemwhich is equivalent to the per formance of work One is forced to conclude that all such attempts at the solution of biological problems are based on fundamental misunderstandings Dogmatism must be avoided in scientific criticism nevertheless it seems to the reviewer that the following gen eral considerations are incontrovertible and that they are quite inconsistent with the type of vitalism represented by Driesch and John stone First the organism is a system whose development and continued existence are de pendent on the rigid constancy of physico chemical modes of operation here if anywhere in nature stability of the internal or vital con ditions is indispensable otherwise it is incon ceivable that the complex living system could persist and maintain its characteristic activ ities and often delicate adjustment to the sur roundings Clearly the numerous and diverse processes whose integration constitutes life could not deviate far from a definite norm without fatal derangement of the whole mechanism Second the basis for this reg ularity is the regularity of physicochemical processes in general These the more closely they are subjected to scientific scrutiny ap pear the more definite and constant in their character this conclusion is notas many phil osophical critics of scientific method maintain an illusion resulting from the inherently classificatory nature of intellectual operations it is simply a matter of observation and experi mental verification Repeat the conditions of a phenomenon and the phenomenon recurs We find this to be equally the case in living organ isms and in nonliving systems and it appears to be as true of psychical as of physical phe nomena The difficulty in dealing with organ isms is to secure exact repetition of condi tions because organisms are in their nature complex and complexity means a large num ber of factors which may vary Regularity in fact may be said to be of the very essence of vital processes special devices for securing regularity e g constancy of bodytempera ture of the osmotic pressure and reaction of the tissuemedia etc are highly character istic of organisms It would seem that an entelechy disturbing this regularity however intelligently would be not only superfluous but detrimental Moreover we must always re member that unequivocal evidence for the existence of such an agency is quite lacking Thus there seems to be no valid reason to believe that organisms differ essentially from nonliving systems as regards the conditions under which the processes underlying vitality take place The conditions of natural exist ence and happening appear everywhere and at all times to be homogeneous whatever existence itself may be This conclusion seems unavoidable to the impartial observer of natural processes the repetition so characteristic of nature is apparently an expression of this central fact The flux like character of natural existence so in sisted upon by Bergson and the other Hera cleiteans is to be admitted only in a highly qualified sense Repetition and the existence of discontinuities and abrupt transitions are equally characteristic and all of the evidence of physical science goes to show that a repe titious or atomistic construction lies at the very basis of things So far from the intel lect arbitrarily imposing a diagrammatic uni formity and repetition upon a nature which in reality is a progressive flux and never repeats itselfto the student of natural science it ap pears rather true that the conceptualizing characteristic of the reasoning process is itself one expression of this fundamental mode of natural occurrencethat it is in fact the derivative of a peculiarity which pervades na 844 SCIENCEDECEMBER 11 1914 ture throughout Such a view if well estab lished would refute the contention that scien tific methods being intellectual in their char acter necessarily involve a falsification and would dispose of attempts to discredit physio logical analysis on the ground that life trans cends intellect and hence is properly to be in vestigated by other than scientific methods The attempt to find in organisms evidence of special agencies not operative in the rest of nature seems to the reviewer to show less and less promise of success as physicochemical and physiological science advances Thus the au thors attempt to limit the applicability of the second law of energetics to the nonliving part of nature is quite unjustified by the evi dence which he presents The interception and accumulation of a portion of the radiant energy received by the green plant in the form of chemical compounds of high potential is in no sense an infringement of the second law as well might one hold that the partial transformation of radiant energy into poten tial energy of position as seen e g in the accumulation of glaciers is an instance of this kind The partial transformation of energy at low potential into energy at high potential is in fact a frequent occurrence thus the tem perature of an electric arc far exceeds that of the furnace which generates the current sim ilarly the animal organism utilizes energy de rived from oxidation of carbohydrates and proteins to build up compounds of much higher chemical potential viz the fats If living organismssystems which are specially characterized by utilizing chemical energy as the main source of their activityexhibit such tendencies there is in this fact nothing anom alous from the point of view of physical sci ence To say on the basis of this kind of evi dence that life appears as a tendency which is opposed to that which we see to be charac teristic of inorganic processes page 314 is surely unwarranted from any point of view This review is not necessarily an attack on vitalism but only on certain current forms of vitalism It can scarcely be denied that there is something distinctive about life but at the present advanced stage of physical science it seems futile to argue that the vital process is the expression of an agency which is absent from nonliving material systems Viewed temporarily or historically the vital is seen to develop out of the nonvital many of the steps in this process are still obscure but with the progress of science it becomes more and more evident that the development is continu ous in character Hence if we are to account for life we must equally account for nonliv ing nature Now since nature exhibits itself as coherent throughout we must conclude that in its inception3 it held latent or potential within itself the possibility of life This is not entirely an unbased speculation even in the character of the chemical elements life is fore shadowed in a sense as shown in Hendersons recent interesting book4 In a recent discus sion5 in some respects related to the present the reviewer has called attention to one impli cation of the scientific view of nature and the cosmic process If we assume constancy of the elementary natural processes and con stancy in the modes of connection between themas exact observation forces us to do there seems no avoiding the conclusion that given an undifferentiated universe at the outsetonly one course of evolution can ever have been possible Laplace long ago per ceived this consequence of the mechanistic view of nature and the inevitability of his conclusion has never been seriously disputed by scientific men Nevertheless this is a very strange result and to many has seemed a re ductio ad absurdum of the scientific view as applied to the whole of nature The di lemma can be avoided only if we recognize that the question of ultimate origins is not strictly speaking a scientific question at all and in saying this there is implied no dis paragement of scientific method As an ob ject of scientific investigation nature has to 3 I do not use this term necessarily in a histor ical sense but rather in the sense of ultimate origin of whatever kindwhich it may well be necessary to conceive as extratemporal 4 The Fitness of the Environment Mae millans

evolve in a certain way is a question which really lies beyond the sphere of natural science Such considerations if they do not exactly remove the vitalistic dilemma yet separate sharply the scientific problems which organisms pre sent from the metaphysical questions to which the phenomena of lifemore than any others give rise If we consider the organism simply as a system forming a part of external nature we find no evidence that it possesses properties that may not eventually be satis factorily analyzed by the methods of physico chemical science but we admit also that those peculiarities of ultimate constitution which have in the course of evolution led to the ap pearance of living beings in nature are such that we can not well deny the possibility or even legitimacy of applying a vitalistic or biocentric conception to the cosmic process considered as a whole Although disagreeing with the authors main contentions the reviewer wishes to recog nize the merits of the book as an interesting enthusiastic and ingenious contribution to the literature of its subject We have noted some errors in matters of biological detail but these are not such as to affect the main argument The brief account of certain physiological processes seems somewhat out of date the ac count of the nerve impulse is unsatisfactory and certainly few physiologists now hold that a muscle is a thermodynamic machine in the sense conceived by Engelmann there is some evidence of unfamiliarity with biochemistry the term  animoacid instead of aminoacid recurs a number of times a misspelling per

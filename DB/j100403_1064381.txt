contri bution It would seem that this has been due to a great extent to the development of the law of torts and the very considerable en largement of its scope The word tort at first of rather restricted application has come of late to include many wrongs involving but a slight tincture of moral delinquency that were previously remedi less17 JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF JOINT TORTFASORS FOR NEG LIGENT INJURIESWhile it is true as stated by an eminent writer on the subject of torts1 that no comprehensive general rule can be formulated which will harmonize all the authorities as to what con stitutes a joint liability among tortfeasors for negligent injuries a review and classification of the cases on the subject reveals the fact that the seeming conflict of opinion is far more apparent than real This question can be considered most conveniently under four sep arate heads 1 Persons who act separately and independently each causing a separate and distinct injury cannot be sued jointly even though the injuries may have been precisely similar in character and inflicted at the same time2 A joint tort is essential to the maintenance of a joint action3 For entirely separate and distinct wrongs in no wise connected actually or impliedly it is undenied that wrongdoers are liable only in separate actions4 2 When two or more persons owe to another a common duty which each wongfully neglects to perform then although the negli gence of each was without concert if such several neglects concurred in causing the injury there is a joint tort with a joint and several liability5 Likewise where the negligent acts of several persons en gaged in a common undertaking results in injury to some third party they are jointly and severally liable and this although the specific injury was done by one of the parties alone6 Here the liability is founded upon the concert of action A fortiori where there is unitv 17 Palmer v Wick  Pulteneytown Steam Shipping Co 1894 A C

negligently causing the injury are subject to a joint and several liability therefor7 3 Where several persons acting without concert of action inde pendently and without any common duty by their several acts con tribute to produce a single injury each being sufficient to have produced the whole and it is impossible to distinguish the portions of the injury caused by each they are joint tortfeasors8 Thus where two contiguous buildings fell upon and crushed a third in tervening building by reason of the coexistent and concurrent neg ligence of the respective owners thereof in failing to keep their sep arate walls in repair the owners were liable jointly and severally for the injury9 4 Although there is considerable conflict of opinion on this point the following statement may yet be taken as the rule supported by the decided weight of authority Where the negligence of two or more persons produces a single indivisible injury although such per sons acted independently of one another without a common duty common design or concert of action they are jointly and severally liable and this although without fault on the part of one a part or the whole of the same damage would have resulted from the neglect of the other10 This view is maintained in the recent case of John son v Thomas Irvine Lumber Co Wash 135 Pac 217 It has been stated that to make tortfeasors jointly liable there must be some sort of community in the wrongdoing and the injury must be due in some way to their joint work but it is not necessary that they be acting together or in concert if their concurring negligence occa sions the injuryl Each wrongdoer is liable because of the neglect of his own duty and all are jointly liable because the acts of all con tributed to the injury12 Apparently in conflict with the view above set forth there are numerous cases holding that such tortfeasors are liable only for the  Klauder v McGrath 35 Pa St 128 78 Am Dec 329 Consolidated IceMachine Co v

really cases of nuisances in which class of torts a different rule14 is universally admitted as prevailing Though the dissent from the doctrine here maintained is not as great as it would at first appear there are quite a number of very able courts which take the view that tortfeasors not acting in coln cert or by unity of design are not liable jointly and severally for damages although the consequences of the several torts have iunited to produce an injury to the plaintiff15 But this view is lecidedlv in the minority and the one first advanced seems much the better on both reason and authority16 NEGLIGENCE or PARENT IMPUTED TO INFANTSThe doctrine im puting to an infant the negligence of the parents originated in Eng land The principle was first recognized in this country in a New York case where an infant of tender years was denied recovery for injuries by reason of the negligence of its parents in allowing it to be in danger2 It cannot have any application to infants old enough to be guilty of contributory negligence3 Other cases arise where the parent is present and actively negligent No distinction exists which warrants the application of different rules to the two classes of cases Of the first class was the case first es tablishing the rule in this country It is submitted that the reasoning in the case was unsound and it has since been much criticized4 It denies to the infant the protection of the law The parent is in truth the guardian of the infant when the latter is not sui juris but it can not be justly said that the acts of the parent are the acts of the infant and thus allow in effect a waiver by the parent of a tort upon the infant In Vermont the doctrine was first directly repudiated There a rule was adopted which has received sanction in a majority of the 13 Chipman v Palmer 77 N Y 51 33 Am Rep 566 Watson  Co lusaParrot etc Co 31 Mont 513 79 Pac 14 Ames v Dorset Mar ble Co 64 Vt 10 23 Atl 857 Sloggy v Dilworth 38 Minn 179 36 N W 451 8

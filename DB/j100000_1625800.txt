ordi nary  safety be dipped in the paste which is put upon the sides of the match box and which contains red phosphorus and sulphide of anti mony the match will be found capable of igni ting upon any surface Meanwhile it is said that in France the State engineers have succeeded in giving a formula for making lucifer matches which does not include either white phosphorus or any substance injurious to the health of the hands or that of the public Machinery has also been ivented which will contribute to the health and safety of the hands The machin ery has been tested after a few improvements have been made in it it will be generally adopted in the government lucifer match fac tories THE Governor of Madagascar the native government of which has recently been sup planted by that of civilized France has issued an order forbidding any except Frenchmen to col lect fossils in the island Natural Science which takes this information from the Geographical Journal which finds it in the Politique Coloniale for May 25th properly asks whether the natural ists of France official and otherwise have been consulted on this subject or whether it is merely the order of a politician ignorant of the methods of scientific men DR GEORG WALTEMATH of Hamburg is in satiable of moons He has sent us under the date of July 20th an announcement of a third moon for the earth This moon is said to be 427250 kg distant and is 746 km in diam eter It is nearer than Dr Waltemaths other moon and is a wahrhafter Wetterund Mag netMond Perhaps it is also the moon pre siding over lunacy UNDER the editorship of Professor Joseph S Ames of Johns Hopkins University the Har pers announce a series of scientific reprints similar in plan to Oswalds Klassiker der exacten Wissenschaften The first volume of the series will include the papers by Guy Lussac and Julien Thomson on the free expan sion of gases and the second Fraunhofers papers on prismatic and diffraction spectra 185 THE Berlin correspondent of the London Times telegraphs that an appeal has just been made to patriots thinkers writers and to the world of thought and culture in Germany at large to unite together in the foundation of a Kaiser Wilhelm Library for Posen similar to that subscribed for and presented to the city of Strassburg after the war of 187071 The library is to be presented to Posen for the pur pose of furthering German culture and influence among the Slavonic population and for com bating the everincreasing antagonism of the Poles The importance of Germanizing the Poles has been recognized as a growing neces sity and for that purpose a provincial library in Thorn and a technical high school in Danzig are to be established The ultimate founda tion of a German university in the province of Posen is considered as a future possibility In the meantime donations and offerings of books are earnestly solicited and by spreading Ger man knowledge it is hoped to diffuse a strong feeling for German ideas among the peasantry of East Prussia UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS PROFESSOR SIMON NEWCOMB will next year resume the active superintendency of the work in mathematics and astronomy in Johns Hop kins University He expects to give a course of lectures on the Encyclopaedia of the Mathe matical Sciences and will especially direct students pursuing advanced work in celestial mechanics

the Technical Institute at Charlottenberg and Dr Kopsch in anatomy in the University of Berlin DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE STABILITY IN GENERIC NOMENCLATURE IN the June number of the Botanical Gazette Dr B L Robinson has called attention to the fact that the Rochester Rules do not provide criteria for determining the application of ge neric names It is also pointed outtthat a strict interpretation of the principle of priority would demand that the first species placed under a genus should serve as its nomenclatorial  type to which the name should remain attached The execution which such a rule would work among the older names is it appears the reason why the makers of the Rochester Code have hesitated to enact or put it in practice This omission is criticised as gravely inconsistent in a system of absolute and decisive character Much nomenclatorial discussion has failed of any definite purpose for lack of agreement as to the nature of the taxonomic problem Con sciously or unconsciously systematists belong to two schools representing for the purposes of illustration the idealists and realists Accord ing to the former systems of classification and their categories are mental concepts merely pigeonholes so to speak into which the indi vidual units of biologic phenomena can be as sorted If the arrangement of the pigeonholes prove too inconvenient changes may be neces sary but these are made with reluctance and it is fondly hoped that each readjustment may be the last The idealistic systematist views nature from the standpoint of the system and while he may not be a philosophic idealist as well and deny the material existence of the objects of his study he not infrequently declares and uniformly acts on the opinion that species genera and families do not exist in nature but are made by the naturalist In accordance with this view the various categories mentioned con sist primarily of definitions to which names are attached The usage of the earlier systema tists corresponded somewhat to our present cus tom of patenting new inventions If the defi nition or specification proved faulty it was set aside name and all and a supposedly improved combination of characters was arranged for the consideration of posterity This was entirely just and logical for if the genus definition did not correspond to anything in nature it was of no use to the naturalist and should properly give way to the clearer concept of the later student with his presumably wider knowledge of forms No uniformity nor stability could come however from such a method biologic progress would mean an endless succession of names an infinite mass of competing generic concepts to be sifted and arranged constituting an almost insurmountable barrier between nature and formal knowledge To avoid this threatened chaos it became customary to retain older names emend the descriptions and credit 186 SCIENCE

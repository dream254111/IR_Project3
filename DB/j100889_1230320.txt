MADISON WiS In attempting to answer the question Who owns the agricultural land of the United States the census classification of owner operated tenantoperated and manageroperated farms is of assist ance In the first division the ownership is in the hands of the tiller of the soil In 1920 there were 636508324 acres in this class of which 46II12031 acres were under the control of owners operating an entire farm and 175396293 acres in the hands of farmers operat ing rented acres in addition to the land actually their property From another standpoint part of this area ought to be classed with the tenantoperated acreage of which there are 265193415 acres In the third class are 53974806 acres operated by hired managers Expressed in percentages the land operated by both classes of owners composed 666 per cent of the farm land of the United States the tenant area 277 per cent and the manageroperated area 56 per cent OwnerOperated Farm LandOf the land operated by owners only a small fraction is the property of the colored races Figures for the acreage owned by various classes are not yet available for 1920 but in 191o the colored farmers owned only 3 per cent of the entire owneroperated land area of the United States and the propor tion probably has not changed much since then2 The acreage owned by foreignborn white farmers is not separated from that owned by white farmers in general However in 1910 814 per cent of the foreignborn white farmers were owners In order to get an estimate of the acreage owned we may disregard the differences in acreage in owner tenant and managercontrolled farms and take 80 per cent of the 111176522 acres operated by all foreignborn farmers in I9203 This gives us about 89oooooo acres or 13Y2 per cent of the owneroperated area under the control of foreignborn white farmers 1 Census Release Aug 19 192I 2 U S Census 1910 Vol V p 182 3 Census Release July II 1921 Foreignborn farmers operated II6 per cent of the total farm acreage in I920 or about 8 of all the land operated by white farmers This does not separate owner operation from the other forms of tenure however 34WEHRWEIN WHO OWNS THE AGRICULTURAL LAND 35 Foreignborn White FarmersThe foreignborn white farmer merits some special attention because of his capacity for becoming a home owner Compared to the 663 per cent of the white farmers who owned their farms according to the census of 1910 814 per cent of the foreignborn white farmers owned their farms4 Calculations based on State census bulletins of 1920 show this proportion has not become less It is about the same for the Pacific States the Middle West and over 88 per cent in New England a section where the proportion of foreignborn farmers to all farmers is greater now than it was in 1910 This capacity for ownership has been explained by saying that the foreignborn farmer is an older man than the native farmer but this is only one factor in a complete explanation The foreigner brings with him a faculty for hard work persistence thrift and endurance which makes him a powerful competitor of the Amer ican farmer But it is rather difficult to say just where these praise worthy attributes leave off and a mere low standard of living begins In closely knit foreign communities it is not only the foreignborn who have these qualities but also their children even to the second and third generation In pioneer days these qualities helped to con quer the wilderness today they make it possible for the lowstandard farmer to overbid the highstandard farmer either in renting or buy ing land The displacement of one foreign stock by another is not uncommon nor the displacement of one race by another In South ern Travis County Texas the white tenant was replaced by the negro tenant who in turn gave way before the still lowerstandard Mexican This problem finds its climax in the Japanese situation on the Pacific Coast Professor Pitkin claims that the Oriental question is not one of race prejudice but a battle of standards of living because in cer tain sections of California the Armenian is hated as much as the Japanese even though he belongs to the white race5 Pitkin claims that  if we wish to maintain or regain the American as a farmer we must not force him to meet competition by lowering his standard of living Those who advocate the placing of immigrants on farms and especially on submarginal lands have not considered the best interests of the American farmer This problem is intimately associated with land ownership We need to distinguish between those races which readily assimilate American ideals and adopt our standards of living and those who do not To the extent that a lowstandard race is able to acquire a foot 4 U S Census I9Io Vol V p 170 5 Pitkin  Must We Fight Japan  p 250 Chap 2636 JOURNAL OF FARM ECONOMICS hold by acquiring property rights in the soil to that extent will it control the social and political destiny of the community and the larger the foreign community the harder will it be to break down old beliefs customs and standards by Americanization The Mexican is not much of a problem because he does not be come a landowner Could the negro combine with his power to endure a low standard of life the passion for the soil which the Oriental has one wonders whether he would not present another Japatiese problem Ownership of Land Area Operated by TenantsIn discussing the ownership of the land operated by renters the classification used so far nativeborn white foreignborn white and colored may be dropped It is probably true that far less than 3 per cent of this area is owned by colored farmers and more than 13Y2 per cent is owned by foreignborn whites The proportion of the total farm area of the United States operated by tenants is growing steadily It is believed by some that this means the gradual concentration of the ownership of this land into the hands of fewer and fewer individuals6 The census of 19oo shows that up to that time at least the ownership of rented land was widely dif fused Over 80 per cent of the landlords owned only one farm each Another 17 per cent owned more than one but less than 5 farms and about 3 per cent owned 5 farms or more Most of those who owned more than two farms were proprietors of southern plantations Evi dences of concentration were so few in 1910o that it was not considered necessary to make a similar investigation at that time7 The ownership of rented land would not present a problem were it not for the influence the landlord has over the farm itself over the tenant and over the community in which the farm is located We have at the one extreme the landlord who looks upon his farm as a permanent investment so conducted as to increase its productiveness as time goes on yielding longrun profits and who regards his tenant as a partner On the other extreme is the  absentee landlord whose influence is held to be next to war and pestilence in its pernicious ness8 Between these two extremes are hundreds of landlords of varying degrees of absenteeism  so naturally the landlords atti tude can not be made the basis for accurate classification However we may say that in general the greater the distance between the land 6 See Report of Industrial Relations Com Vol IX pp 89513 7 I900 Census Vol V pp lxxxviii and lxxxix IgIo Census Vol V p 102 8 Carver  Rural Economics

resi dence The census of 1900oo shows that 752 per cent of the owners of rented farms lived in the same county in which their farms were located 152 per cent lived in the same State but outside of the county and 51 per cent lived out of the State leaving 45 per cent of the farms with no report on the residence of the owner The various social and economic and farm management surveys also fur nish some data although such data are not always strictly comparable The accompanying table shows that for three scattered areas the owners of rented land living out of the county in which the farm was

county and only 16 had moved to town Under the plantation system of the South where a plantation is a group of rented farms grouped around a resident owner or man ager it was found that in 325 counties only 48 per cent of the tenants lived on farms not under the plantation system operating only 24 per cent of the farm area of these counties Certainly many of these farms belong to landlords living nearby or at least in the country The amount of absenteeism here is small While these data are meager they indicate that as a rule the resi dence of landlords is near enough to the farms to allow ample super vision or at least the proper interest in the farm and the community Closely connected with absentee ownership is alien ownership fea tured every now and then by popular magazine writers One such writer states that about the year 1899 fortysix foreign individuals and corporations owned land in the United States aggregating twenty six million acres equal in area to the State of Indiana a large part of this belonging to the nobility of Great Britain0 As far as agricultural land is concerned there is little evidence of such foreign ownership The census of 1900oo revealed only 244505 acres of rented land held by a total of 789 alien owners Of these 324 lived in Canada and 55 in Mexico Neither was the ownership concentrated 699 out of the 789 owned only one farm each How ever some alien owners were not enumerated because like the Scullys they had taken up a legal residence in the United States and others operated their farms through managers and were not enumer ated here An important factor that modifies absenteeism is the personal relation of the landlord to his tenant The data from the surveys show that in many cases laridlords are related to their tenants by blood or marriage The son or soninlaw obtains the farm on easy terms gradually acquiring full possession as the owner  retreats  to retirement The table shows that percentage of tenants so related varies from 13 to 50 per cent while in Rock and Green Counties Wisconsin it is 40 per cent and in Woodford County Illinois it is 50 per cent12 There are four types of owners of the rented land area

panies or corporations It is impossible to estimate the number of farmers who besides working their own farms own a second or third farm which they lease The entire plantation system of the South consists of farms partly owned and the rest leased to tenants However the various surveys show that farmer landlords are not uncommon in the North It will be noted that in three areas about 22 per cent of the landlords were active farmers and in two Iowa townships almost 48 per cent Sometimes the process is reversed and the renter is the one who buys land not for the purpose of working it himself but to lease it Some of the Black Land tenants of Texas own farms in east Texas In southern Travis County six tenants were reported who owned farms ranging in size from 55 to 440 acres Perhaps the largest part of the rented farm area of the North is owned by retired farmers In Travis County 12 per cent of the tenants had retired farmers as landlords while in the North the pro portion ranges from 20 to 40 per cent As noted before a great many of these farmers are related to their tenants but this is not always the case Few landlords own more than one farm as the census of 19oo revealed It is evident that most retired farmers have an income from but one farm and therefore are not in a position to be as liberal with their tenants as the business men and the large companies can be in times of financial distress Governor Ferguson testifying before the Industrial Relations Commission in Dallas Texas 1915 traced the growth of the  bonus system  of a cash rent in addition to the customary share rent to the retired farmer landlord The retired farmer can not keep pace with the people he associates with in town and pretty soon that 350 acres of land wont support him said the governor and consequentlyhe goes back and raises the rent on the poor fellow in the country 1 It is impossible to say what proportion of the retired farmers are so situated but it is certain that they must be classed with  absentee  landlords in certain cases14 It has also been noted in Texas Iowa and Illinois that the aim of many a tenant is to accumulate money as fast as possible in order to purchase a farm not to operate but to lease to another tenant and then live off the rent and the better farmer he is the sooner he is able to retire There can be no quarrel about the right of any man to retire from active life if he so chooses but such a process elimi a3 Report Vol IX p 8958 4 Prairie Farmer Feb 25 1920 Elpaso Hearing of Illinois Land Com40 JOURNAL OF FARM ECONOMICS nates the most productive farmers paves the way for a permanent tenant system and produces a group of small income  feltboot ave nue farmers in the nearby towns15 The third group of landlords are the bankers business men and others who said Prof Hibbard in 1912  have bought farms in the vicinity of every hamlet in Iowa for the past ten years 16 Dur ing the  boom thirtyone per cent of the buyers of Iowa land were real estate men bankers merchants and others not engaged in agri culture Most of these buyers are speculators interested in the in crement that constantly rising values bring and may therefore en courage their renters to exploit the land as fast as possible7 The table shows that the percentage of nonagricultural landlords may vary from 882 to 42 per cent Two surveys also list the rented farms owned by women In both cases nearly one fifth of the farms were so owned The last type of owner of rented land is the large land holder or the corporation The Scully estates and the Wadsworth estate of New York are typical examples Just what part of the area of agri cultural land is under the control of landlords of this type it is im possible to say These large holdings have been criticized and it is not at all clear whether their methods are detrimental or otherwises This leads us to the subject of large land holdings in general California is the classic example The study of the large land hold ings of the eight southern counties of California made in 1919 shows that outside of railroad and public land one half of the land area was owned by 250 individuals and corporations but this statement loses its significance when one notes that in some counties the percentage tillable is only 12 per cent and generally it does not rise above 40 per cent The results obtained by a seminar working a whole year on the subject of large land holdings at the University of Wisconsin showed that outside of the West and Southwest the large land hold ings are practically a negligible factor Ozwnership of ManagerOperated FarmsLarge land holdings are usually operated by managers California has the largest num ber of this class of farms with New England second followed by Pennsylvania New York and Illinois They tend to cluster around the big cities where they are the play farms of wealthy business 15 Iowa No 193 p 228 16 Am Stat Ass Vol 12 pp 469471 17  Survey of Red

where they are located However there are many others that are paying concerns and are capable of great usefulness especially in the purebred stock business The application of large capital and man agerial ability to agriculture is not to be discouraged ConclusionIn trying to answer the question stated in its am bitious title this paper has done little more than to point out the problems that have developed in the United States in connection with the ownership of agricultural land The dearth of statistical data and accurate information suggests the need for extended research in this field It is quite apparent however that the problems of con centration of ownership absentee and alien ownership the ownership of land by lowstandard nationalities and tenancy are highly local in character and take on different aspects as types of agriculture and races vary Solutions must therefore be sought in State and com munity action rather than in national legislation

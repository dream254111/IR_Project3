ADDED REASON FOR REGARDING THE STOCKHOLDERS AS SURETIES THE DE CISION REACHED BY THE COURT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONE CONSISTENT WITH REASON AND THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY ALLEGATIONS AS TO BENEFICIARIES IN ACTIONS FOR DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACTIT IS A WELLSETTLED RULE OF THE COMMON LAW THAT AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES FOR THE WRONGFUL DEATH OF A PERSON CANNOT BE MAINTAINED BY HIS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OR HIS HEIR SINCE SUCH A RIGHT IS ONE PERSONAL TO THE DECEDENT AND AS SUCH ABATES WITH HIS DEATH1 THE RULE IS EXPRESSED IN THE MAXIM ACTIO PERSONALIS MORITUR CUM PERSONA IT IS SUPPORTED ALSO BY THE PROPOSITION LAID DOWN BY LORD ELLENBOROUGH IN THE CASE OF BAKER V BOLTON 2 THAT IN A CIVIL COURT THE DEATH OF A HUMAN BEING CANNOT BE COMPLAINED OF AS AN INJURY THIS RIGHT OF ACTION HOWEVER MUST BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE RIGHT TO RECOVER DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF SERVICE SUFFERED BETWEEN THE INJURY AND THE DEATH WHERE DEATH IS NOT INSTANTANEOUS SUCH LATTER ACTION CAN BE MAINTAINED BY THE MASTER HUSBAND PARENT ETC FOR LOSS OF SERVICES OR CONSORTIUM BY REASON OF INJURY TO THE SERVANT WIFE CHILD ETC AS IT IS NOT A RIGHT PERSONAL TO THE DECEASED BUT EXISTS IN FAVOR OF THE PERSON ENTITLED TO THE SERVICES3 TO REMEDY PARTIALLY THIS DEFECT THE NOW FAMOUS LORD CAMPBELLS ACT WAS PASSED BY PARLIAMENT IN 18464 IT GAVE A RIGHT OF ACTION TO DECEASEDS WIFE HUSBAND PARENT AND CHILD WHERE THE INJURIES CAUSING THE DEATH WERE SUCH THAT THE DECEASED IF DEATH HAD NOT RESULTED THEREFROM MIGHT HIMSELF HAVE MAINTAINED AN ACTION FOR DAMAGES THE ENGLISH RULE SEEMS TO BE THAT SINCE THIS RIGHT EX ISTED ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE STATUTE IT COULD BE ENFORCED IN FAVOR OF THOSE PERSONS ALONE WHO WERE NAMED IN THE STATUTE AND HENCE WHERE THERE WERE NO SUCH PERSONS IN EXISTENCE NO CAUSE OF ACTION COULD ARISE5 IT WOULD SEEM NATURALLY TO FOLLOW THAT THE DECLARA TION IN AN ACTION UNDER THE ACT MUST ALLEGE THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OR MORE PERSONS ENTITLED TO RECOVER FOR OTHERWISE NO CAUSE OF ACTION WOULD BE

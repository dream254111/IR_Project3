added reason for regarding the stockholders as sureties The de cision reached by the court would seem to be the only one consistent with reason and the principles of equity ALLEGATIONS AS TO BENEFICIARIES IN ACTIONS FOR DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACTIt is a wellsettled rule of the common law that an action for damages for the wrongful death of a person cannot be maintained by his personal representative or his heir since such a right is one personal to the decedent and as such abates with his death1 The rule is expressed in the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona It is supported also by the proposition laid down by Lord Ellenborough in the case of Baker v Bolton 2 that in a civil court the death of a human being cannot be complained of as an injury This right of action however must be distinguished from the right to recover damages for loss of service suffered between the injury and the death where death is not instantaneous Such latter action can be maintained by the master husband parent etc for loss of services or consortium by reason of injury to the servant wife child etc as it is not a right personal to the deceased but exists in favor of the person entitled to the services3 To remedy partially this defect the now famous Lord Campbells Act was passed by Parliament in 18464 It gave a right of action to deceaseds wife husband parent and child where the injuries causing the death were such that the deceased if death had not resulted therefrom might himself have maintained an action for damages The English rule seems to be that since this right ex isted only by virtue of the statute it could be enforced in favor of those persons alone who were named in the statute and hence where there were no such persons in existence no cause of action could arise5 It would seem naturally to follow that the declara tion in an action under the act must allege the existence of one or more persons entitled to recover for otherwise no cause of action would be stated  Worthen v State Ala 60 South 686 Dixon v Caledonian Ry L R 5 App Cas 820 43 L T 513 29 W R 249 45 J P 105 1 Osborn v Gillett L R 8 Ex 88 Baker v Bolton 1 Camp 493 Bligh v Biddeford  S R Co 94

31 L T N S 847 TIFFANY ON DEATH BY WRONGFUL ACT 2 ed  23 376In this country most of the states have passed statutes similar to Lord Campbells Act These statutes for convenience of dis cussion may be divided into two general classes The first class embraces those which like Lord Campbells Act give a right of action to or in behalf of certain designated and limited classes of persons And the second class of statutes are those which are so broad in their designation of persons entitled to recover that a failure of beneficiaries is impossible In construing the statutes of the first classthose that give a right of recovery to certain limited classes of personsthe Ameri can courts have usually followed the English rule as to the al legation of beneficiaries They have generally but not universally reasoned that such statutes are in derogation of the common law and are therefore to be strictly construed Hence only those per sons named in the particular statute are entitled to damages for the wrongful death And finally therefore such persons must be alleged in the declaration to exist for otherwise no cause of action can be shown and no right of recovery set out6 Such was the holding in the recent case of Troll v Laclede Gaslight Co Mo 169 S W 337 And the same has been held under the Federal Employers Liability Act7 It would be absurd in such a case to 6 Johnson v Dixie Mining etc Co

his decedent the complaint is sufficient if it names the widow and children but does not allege that the action is brought for their benefit Archibald v Lincoln County 50 Wash 55 96 Pac 831 Where the statute provides that the damages must inure exclusively to the benefit of the widow and children if any or next of kin a widower suing for damages for the death of his wife must allege that there are no children for if there are surviving children they may recover damages to the exclusion of the widower Bartlett v Chicago R I  P Ry Co 21 Okla 415 96 Pac 468 So where the statute gives the parents a right of action for the wrongful death of their son only in case he has left no widow and children the parents in bringing their action must allege the nonexistence of the widow or children or both Register v Harrell 131 La 983 60 South 638 And where the statute allows the administrator to bring the action only in case the deceased leave no surviving child the petition must allege that no child survives and an allegation that deceased was single and unmar ried is insufficient as there may be adopted children Hegberg v St Louis  S F R Co 164 Mo App 514 147 S W 192 But a wife suing for the death of her husband need not negative the existence of minor children the issue of the marriage where her right of action is not conditioned on the nonexistence of such children Davis v Ark South R Co 117 La 320 41 South 587 And an allegation that deceased left surviving him a father and mother and two sisters naming them negatives the idea that he left other persons entitled to take under the statute Pries v Ashland Home Tel Co 143 Wis 606 128 N W 281  Farley v N Y N H  H R Co 87 Conn 328 87 Atl 990 Melz ner v Northern Pac Ry Co 46 Mont 277 127 Pac 1002 NOTES 377VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW allow a personal representative to recover damages and then have it later develop that there is no one to whom under the statute he could lawfully pay the money recovered Alabama and Con necticut however have held that such a collateral fact as the exist ence of heirs at law need not be alleged but will be presumed8 But on principle and authority the majority holding is based on the sounder reasoning Likewise it is generally necessary under such statutes to allege dependence of the beneficiaries upon the deceased or pecuniary loss to them because of his death for the object of the statutes is usually to compensate relatives or dependents for pecuniary loss9 Such loss however will sometimes be presumed from a showing of certain relationships between the beneficiaries and the deceased the relationship in question involving generally a legal obligation on the part of the deceased to support the beneficiaries or contrib ute to their support10 The statutes do not as a general rule contemplate the giving of damages because of mental suffering on the part of the beneficiaries1 The second class of statutesthose providing inexhaustible classes of beneficiariesexist in some States of the Union Under 8 Columbus  W Ry Co v Bradford 86 Ala 574 6 South 90 Budd v Meriden Electric R Co 69 Conn 272 37 Atl 683 These cases can possibly be distinguished from the majority view in that a man may be presumed to leave general heirs but not particular classes of heirs or heirs dependent upon him for support Hence where the statute provides expressly or in effect for the distribution of the dam ages among a mans heirs the above presumption will supply the necessary allegation of existing beneficiaries in the declaration But where recovery is allowed for the benefit of only a wife husband child or other particular class of heir or relative or for the benefit of next of kin dependent upon the deceased there is no such general presumption of law and omitted allegations in the declaration render it defective See Farley v N Y N H  H R Co supra Melzner v Northern Pac Ry Co supra Contra Ruiz v Santa Barbara etc Co supra Webster v Norwegian Min Co supra 9 West Chicago etc R Co

378NOTES 379 these statutes provision is usually made for recovery of damages for the wrongful death by certain persons if there be any such sur viving the deceased and then in default of such surviving bene ficiaries provision is further made in various ways for some final disposition of the damages recovered in the action no matter what circumstances may exist It is manifest therefore that under these statutes there is no possibility of an entire failure of persons en titled to receive what damages are recovered Although there may be no survivors of a certain class there is bound to be from the wording of the statute some existing person or agency capable of taking the money recovered The courts in construing these stat utes have accordingly held that it is not essential in order for a cause of action to exist under their provisions for there to be sur vivors of any particular class or classes of beneficiaries And therefore it is not necessary to allege the existence of such sur vivors in order for the plaintiffs declaration to state a cause of action12 THE DUTY OF A CARRIER TO AWAKEN SLEEPING PASSENGER AT PLACE OF DESTINATIONAs incident to the proper care for the safety and comfort of passengers in alighting from trains a duty is imposed upon common carriers to announce stations a reason able time before arrivall But attempts to stretch this obligation 12 Distributees need not be named where a statute provides that the damages recovered shall be distributed among certain named relatives if such survive and if there are none such then to be disposed of in the manner authorized by law for the distribution of personal prop erty of deceased persons The statute then provides that in default of all above named distributees the property of the decedent shall escheat to the territory Whitmer v El Paso  S W Co C C A 201 Fed 193 The same is true where the constitution provides that the general assembly may provide how the recovery shall go and to whom belong and until such provision is made the same shall form a part of the personal estate of the deceased and no such legislative provision has yet been made East Tenn Tel Co v Simms 99 Ky 404 36 S W

persons dying intestate and that the recovery shall not be subject to any debts or liabilities of the deceased Searle v Kanawha  O Ry Co 32 W Va 370 9 S E 248 Although not directly so decided the rule in Virginia is probably the same under a statute providing that in default of designated classes of beneficiaries the amount so re ceived shall be assets in the hands of the personal representative to be disposed of according to law Va Code 1904  2904 p 110 See Bal timore  0 R R Co v Sherman 71 Va 602 Baltimore  O R R Co v Wightman 70 Va 431 26 Am Rep 384 1 Texas  N O Ry Co v Richardson Tex Civ App

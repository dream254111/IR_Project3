general papers were presented before the whole society 1 H J Wheeler Some problems and methods in agricultural research 2 W V Bovie Some physiological effects pro duced by radiating definite regions within a single cell 3 Earle B Phelps Stream pollution and its relation to the chemical inrdustries 4 W D Harkins The building of atoms and the periodic systems 5 Robert P Fischelis The chemical laboratory as a publicity factor On Wednesday night the largest smoker ever held by the American Chemical Society at which some 1300 were present was enjoyed by all The pro gram consisted of popular songs a series of in teresting films from the various studios among others introducing for the first time films showing the growth characteristic of snow crystals descrip tions by Mr Edward James Cattell of Philadel phia interspersed with songs by Henri Scott of the Metropolitan Company A special feature of the program was an original play representing early chemists meeting in Philadelphia being based on the historical fact that the American Philosophical Society gave a dinner to Dr Joseph Priestly in 1803 at which time Hare s oxhydrogen blowpipe was demonstrated to him opening up a new field of chemical investigation There were also other interesting features The address of President William H Nichols on Research and application given in the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday September 4 drew a large audience The address was printed in the issue of SCIENCE for last week The banquet held at the BellevueStratford Hotel Friday night was one of the largest held by

having been sent to all members of the council on August 1 was passed unanimously after extended discussion No person shall become a member of any Division who is not a member of the American Chemical Society but Divisions may have associate mem bers not members of the American Chemical So ciety who shall be entitled to all the privileges of the Division save that of voting for officers pro vided that such associate members shall not be entitled to any of the other privileges of the American Chemical Society and shall pay such dues of not less than two dollars per annum as the Division may require A report of the American delegates to the Inter allied Chemical Conference held in London July 14 to 17 and Brussels July 22 was presented to the council by E W Washburn The substance of this report will be found in the Journal of Indus trial and Engineering Chemistry and in SCIENCE President Nichols announced that the Army and Navy Departments had responded enthusiastically to the idea that the American Ohemical Society furnish certain lectures on chemical subjects to be given at the West Point and Annapolis academies and that he had reeeived a list of the subjects and the individuals which the officials of the academies desired Editor E J Crane spoke on the plans of the committee on nomenclature spelling and pronuncia tion and stated that the committee hoped to take this matter up also with other chemical societies using the English language in the hope that some coordination between them might be obtained Re ferring to this matter the following motion was passed That the president of the American Chemical Society invite on behalf of the council of the so ciety the governing bodies of the Chemical Soeiety London and the Society of Chemical Industry to appoint a committee or committees on nomen clature spelling and pronunciation to cooperate with the corresponding committee of the American SEPTEMBER 19 1919N S VoL  N o 1290 Society in order to secure as large a measure of agreement in these fields as is practical A communication was presented to the council from Munn and Company New York in regard to their plans for a development of the Scientific American Supplement asking the support and aid of the American Chemical Society in regard to chemical material appearing therein After ex tended discussion the following motion was pre sented to the council was laid on the table and was made a special order for the spring meeting That as a general policy the society do not lend its name to any private undertaking for profit This will not preclude contracts with private con cerns to carry out undertakings of the society It was also voted That a committee of three be appointed to study the question of possible relations between the Amer ican Society and certain scientific publications and report to the next meeting of the council The American Chemical Society of a membership of over 13500 American chemists today by its authorized representatives unanimously adopted the following WHIEREAS the recent war has clearly demon strated that the advancement of science through competently directed research in military prob lems is indispensable to the security of the nation and WWHEREAS the bill recently introduced into Con gress Senate 2715 66 Congressby the General Staff of the Army providing for universal military service and the reorganization of the Army is of such scope and effect as to inevitably impede the development of all technical and scientific work of the Army by placing it under the absolute control and direction of purely miltary officers who do not have the requisite scientific knowledge and WHEREAS an organization so constituted could not function efficiently and in time of stress would prove to be an element of fatal weakness and could never hope to ttract to itself those scientific and technical experts without whose aid modern warfare can not be successfully conducted Now therefore be it resolved that the American Chemical Society emphatically protests against this or any other bill which does not provide for commissioning staff officers in the corps and de partments in which they are to serve and which does not accord to the technical man the same rec ognition and opportunity throughout every grade and department of the Army as are accorded to the man trained for a military career only The secretary presented to the council a summary of some important matters contained in the bill introduced by the general staff of the Army in the 66th Congress known as Senate Bill 2715 pointing out that technically trained men were not given the same privileges an the plans for the organiza tion of the War Department which were given to line officers After discussion the following resolu tions prepared by a committee consisting of B C Hesse M T Bogert and Charles L Reese were unanimously passed The following resolutions were presented and adopted by the council WHEREAS the American Chemical Society is con vinced that the compensation of the chemist in the national and states service like that of the uni versity investigator in chemistry is far below that received in the chemical industries and WHEREAS the government can not maintain an efficient chemical service unless it offers adequate compensation to its chemists and WHEREAS various agencies are now at work toward remedying this situation and WHEREAS the Congressional Commission on Re classification of Federal Employees is one of these agencies Be it therefore resolved that the American Chemical Society hereby pledges its cooperation with Congress and with the Commission of Re classification of Federal Employees with all other agencies with like endeavor and urges upon them the vital necessity to the welfare of this country of remedying the present situation and Be it further resolved that copies of this reso lution be sent to the Commission of Reclassification of Employees the press and be published in the Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry As a result of these resolutions it was voted That the President appoint a committee of three with power directing them to cooperate with the Oommission of Reclassification of Federal Em ployees and to furnish them with any available data and to take such action with the commission and other agencies as shall be thought wise in further ing the ends set forth in the resolution The president appointed W D Bancroft W D Bigelow and Chas L Parsons It was voted that the secretary send the mem bers of the council copies of resolutions regarding Senate Bill 2715 with a request that they take up same with their senators and congressmen and that they bring the matter also to the attention of other members of their local sections CHARLES L PARSONS Secretary

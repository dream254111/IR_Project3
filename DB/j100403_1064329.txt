un der the statute supra the notice takes the place of both the writ and the declaration and is viewed with great indulgence by the courts this does not relieve the plaintiff of the re quirement that he set out in his notice to the defendant matter sufficient to maintain the action In Colley v Summers Parrott Co3 the same rules as to the substantial sufficiency of the notice were reiterated and in this case an allegation of debt on a promissory note was held suffi cient to import the idea of negotiability It is manifest from the trend of the decisions and the recent holding of the present Supreme Court that the interest of the defendant may not be jeopardized by any indefiniteness in the plaintiffs allegation which the latter might seek to excuse under the plea of a liberal construction of  6040 I G C EVIDENCEHEARSAYSPONTANZOUS DECLARATIONS NOT NEC ESSARILY PART OF THE RES GESTAEIn the recent Virginia case of WashingtonVirginia R Co v Deahl1 which was an action by a passenger on an electric car for injuries received when the car on which she was riding collided with a motor truck the Supreme Court of Appeals admitted the testimony of other pas sengers that immediately after the collision the motorman stated to the driver of the truck that this was the third time the driver had tried to pass in front of the car and that he had gotten him Under the circumstances the decision was undoubtedly correct but the court stated that the declaration was admissible as part of the res geste and the advisability of the use of this term in the connection is at least doubtful As is well known great confusion exists among the authorities as to the proper employment of the term res gestce The rule is frequently laid down that a declaration to be admissible under this principle must have been contemporaneous with the occur rence2made by the actor while acting But on the other hand we have numerous cases in which statements have been admitted when made by the actor or an outsider immediately after the act but while his mind was still controlled by the excitement occasioned by the occurrence3 This apparent contradiction seems to be due to the failure of some of the courts including that of Virginia to recognize ex pressly at least that in the latter class of cases we have to do with a distinct exception to the Hearsay Rule under which what 3 119 Va

SECTION are commonly called Spontaneous Declarations are admissible This exception has no necessary logical connection whatever with the res gestce principle in its truer and more limited sense the statements being admitted because their spontaneity and auto matic character insure their trustworthiness The Virginia case above mentioned is a typical illustration of this exception though the court has not called it by that name Another well known instance was Bedingfields Case4 where a woman rushed from a house bledding at the throat and exclaimed Bedingfield cut me dying soon afterwards Here the court failed to rec ognize the exception and excluded the exclamation as being no part of the res gestce This case has however been much criti icised and is generally thought to be erroneous5 so that similar statements are now generally admitted provided they were made under the influence of some startling shock rendering the utter ance spontaneous and before there has been time for reflection to enable the declarant to contrive and misrepresent6 In several earlier Virginia cases declarations which might at first glance appear to be admissible under this principle have been excluded the court invariably stating that they were no part of the res gestca7 A more careful examination of these cases however would seem to indicate that in all of them the exclu sion of the statements was probably proper8 either because too great a time had elapsed since the occurrence of the act to which the statement related or because for other reasons there was a lack of that excitement which is the cause of spontaneity and the guarantee of trustworthiness of this kind of evidence But in the Deahl Case and a few others9 statements which should clearly be within the generally recognized exception for Spon taneous Declarations have been admitted as part of the res geste The topic is still further complicated by a confusion with the rule of agency that the declarations of an agent made within the scope of his employment dum fervet opus are a part of the res gestcw and bind the principal In cases involving a statement  Reg v Bedingfield 14 Cox Cr C 341 6

engineer as to the cause of an accident when the statement is made shortly after the accident the argument frequently turns on the admissibility of the statement as an ad mission by an agent it being inadmissible unless made dum fervet opus10 But the real inquiry in such cases should be whether the circumstances were such as to make the statement a Spon taneous Declaration and thus admissible under that exception to the Hearsay Rule The two inquiries are indeed quite similar but as an agents admission the remark is admissible only when made while the act was in progress while as a Spontaneous Dec laration it is admissible even though made shortly afterwards provided the excitement occasioned by the occurrence still pre vailed over the mind of the speaker The leading case of Vicksburg etc R Co v OBrien 11 il lustrates this confusion Here a statement by a locomotive en gineer was made from ten to thirty minutes after an accident A majority of the court excluded it on the ground that not hav ing been made by the actor while acting it was not a part of the res gestc and hence inadmissible as an admission by an agent Four judges dissenting held that the statement should be received as a part of the res gestce So far as this argument is concerned the majority clearly have the better of it but it is possible that under the circumstances the statement might have been admissi ble as a Spontaneous Declaration In view of the general confusion as to the correct scope of the res gestce principle it is to be hoped that the Virginia Court will henceforth limit the use of the words to those cases where it is clearly applicable if any such there be12 and when occasion next arises will adopt the more modern and more accurate term Spontaneous Declaration T J M JR MASTER

S 99 u Supra U The phrase res gestae is in the present state of the law not only entirely useless but even positively harmful It is useless because every rule of evidence to which it has ever been applied exists as a part of some other wellestablished principle and can be explained in the terms of that principle It is harmful because by its ambiguity it invites the confusion of one rule with another and thus creates uncertainty as to the limitations of both It ought therefore wholly to be repudiated as a vicious element in our legal phraseology It should never be men tioned No rule of evidence can be created or applied by the mere muttering of a shibboleth There are words enough to describe the rules of evidence Even if there were no accepted name for one or an other doctrine any name would be preferable to an empty phrase so en couraging to looseness of thinking and uncertainty of decision 3 WIc MORE EVIDENCE  1795 668

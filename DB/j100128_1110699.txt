CORPORATION TAX Congress at its last session passed an Act which is commonly known as the Corporation Tax Law This Act imposes what is spoken of as a special excise tax of one per cent upon the entire net income over and above 5ooo received from all sources during the year exclusive of amounts received as dividends upon stock of other corporations joint stock companies etc subject to the tax imposed on every corporation joint stock company or asso ciation organized for profit and having capital stock represented by shares and every insurance company organized under the laws of the United States or any State or territory of the United States or under the Acts of Congress applicable to Alaska or the District of Columbia or organized under the laws of any foreign country and engaged in business in any State or territory of the United States or in Alaska or in the District of Columbia All corporations having a net income of less than 5ooo received by them from business transacted and capital invested within the dis tricts affected by the law exclusive of amounts received as divi dends upon stock of other corporations and a series of benevolent philanthropic and charitable corporations enumerated in the Act are exempted in the Act from the payment of this tax Elaborate provisions are made for the determination of what is net income and reports and returns in great detail as to the amount of capital stock bonded indebtedness gross income and all ordinary and necessary expenses and losses are to be made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the purpose of enabling the government to determine the taxable net income of the corpo rations subjected to the payment of the tax As this is the first time in the history of the country that ConCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW gress has attempted to impose a tax on corporations as such the question naturally arises Is this tax constitutional The powers of taxation which have been vested in Congress by the Constitution of the United States are subject to two kinds of limitations these are first those contained in express provi sions of the Constitution and second those which are implied from the general theory of Federal government at the foundation of the Constitution which have as much restrictive force on the powers of Congress as are possessed by the limitations to be found in express constitutional provisions Let us therefore take up one by one the limitations both ex press and implied and endeavor to ascertain whether they apply to the new corporation tax First Express limitations on the taxing power of Congress to be found in the Constitution The only express limitations contained in the Constitution which can be conceived of as applying to this tax law are i The provision in Article I section 2 paragraph 3 that direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union according to their respective numbers etc and that in Article I section 9 paragraph 4 that no capi tation or other direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the census enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken Is a tax on the net income of corporations derived from all sources a direct tax We have at least three decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States bearing on this question These are Pacific Insurance Company v Soulel which holds that a tax on the premiums of insurance companies and individuals engaged in insurance is not a direct tax and Springer v United States2 as limited by Pollock v Farmers Loan and Trust Com pany8 which hold that a tax on income not derived from property but merely from labor or business is not a direct tax The Pollock cases however decided as well that a tax on the rents and income of property both real and personal is a direct tax and therefore not constitutional if it is not apportioned among the States In the decision on the rehearing of the Pollock case4 the Court said 1i868 7 Wall 433 2I88o 102 U S 586 8i895 157 U S 429 158 U S 6oi I895 I58 U S 6oi 618 637 650UNITED STATES CORPORATION TAX We are now permitted to broaden the field of inquiry and to determine to which of the two great classes a tax upon a persons entire income whether derived from rents or products or other wise of real estate or from bonds stocks or other forms of per sonal property belongs and we are unable to conclude that the enforced subtraction from the yield of all the owners real or per sonal property in the manner prescribed is so different from a tax upon the property itself that it is not a direct but an indirect tax in the meaning of the Constitution In summing up its conclusions it reiterated its opinion in the following words Our conclusions may therefore be summed up as follows First Ve adhere to the opinion already announced that taxes on real estate being indisputably direct taxes taxes on the rents or income of real estate are equally direct taxes Second We are of opinion that taxes on personal property or on the income of personal property are likewise direct taxes Third The tax imposed by sections twentyseven to thirty seven inclusive of the act of 1894 so far as it falls on the income of real estate and of personal property being a direct tax within the meaning of the Constitution and therefore unconstitutional and void because not apportioned according to representation all those sections constituting one entire scheme of taxation are necessarily invalid This is the last word of the Supreme Court on this particular point and it is difficult to see how that body without reversing the Pollock cases can well hold that a tax on the net income of cor porations from all sources is constitutional as to that part of the in come which is derived from either real or personal property The contention was made before the court in the Pollock cases that the selection of the entire income as the basis of the tax in some way causes that portion of it derived from property to lose its distinctive character by being merged in an indistinguishable mass somewhat after Chief Justice Marshalls idea expressed in Brown v Maryland5 that imported articles lose their distinctive character as imports and become merged in the general property in the State by passing out of the hands of the original importer or by being taken from the original package in which they were imported This contention would not however appear to be ap proved by the Supreme Court It is true that the Court had at one time in the case of other taxes given its adherence to this doctrine and upheld a State tax on railway gross receipts where I827 12 Wheat 419 651COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW a portion of such receipts had been derived from commerce be tween the States The first and indeed the principal ground of the decision of this case was that as the tax was not levied until the expiration of each half year and until the money received for freights and from other sources of income had actually come into the companys hands that portion of the receipts derived from commerce between the several States had lost its distinctive char acter as freight earned by having become incorporated into the general mass of the companys property6 This doctrine was however distinctly repudiated by the Supreme Court fifteen years later when it said A review of the question convinces us that the first ground on which the decision in State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts was placed is not tenable that it is not supported by anything de cided in Brown v Maryland but on the contrary that the reason ing in that case is decidedly against it7 This is the view which the Supreme Court takes in one of the last if not the last of these railway receipts cases which it has decided8 where it is held that a State gross receipts tax on a railway a large portion of whose receipts come from commerce between the States is unconstitutional The only point in which the present corporation tax differs from these gross receipts taxes is that it is imposed on net income rather than upon gross receipts but this difference cannot be expected to influence the decision as to the point in issue since the income tax law which was declared improper as to income from property in the Pollock cases specially provided that in comput ing incomes the necessary expenses actually incurred in carrying on any business occupation or profession shall be deducted and also all interest due or paid within the year by such person on existing indebtedness The Pollock cases therefore decided that a tax on net income was improper in so far as the income was de rived from property It is to be remembered however that the Pollock cases while deciding that a tax on the income from property was improper where such tax was not apportioned among the States must when read in connection with the Springer case2 and the Pacific Insur ance Company casel be regarded as deciding that a tax on the State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts 1872 I5 Wall 284 295 TPhiladelphia etc Steamship Co v Pennsylvania 1887 122 U S 326 SGalveston Harrisburg  San Antonio Ry Co v Texas I9o8 2Io U S 2I7 652UNITED STATES CORPORATION TAX income from business and labor is not a direct tax and therefore need not be apportioned among the States In the second Pollock case the Court decided that the whole income tax law was void because as a result of its decision that incomes from property were not taxable what was intended as a tax on capital would remain in substance a tax on occupations and labor The Court did not believe that such was the inten tion of Congress But a belief on the part of the Court that the present corporation tax law is unconstitutional in so far as it im poses a tax on the income from property would not necessarily in volve the decision that the whole law is invalid For under the former law the tax was imposed on individuals as well as upon corporations under the present law the tax is imposed on corpora tions organized for profit and on insurance companies As few corporations subject to the tax are organized for any other purpose than to carry on a business it may well be argued that the inten tion of Congress in passing the law was to tax business rather than capital and that therefore the inclusion of income from property is not in the words of the Court a vital part of the scheme for taxation embodied in the law If this is the case the Court may properly hold that from the viewpoint of the direct tax clauses of the Constitution the tax is constitutional in so far as it is levied on net income not derived from property Indeed the actual decision in the first Pollock case is that the decree of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter a decree in favor of the com plainant in respect only of the voluntary payment of the tax on the rents and income of the real estate of the defendant company and of that which it holds in trust and on the income from the municipal bonds owned or so held by it This decision was reached because the Court was equally divided on the proposition whether the void provisions as to rents and income from real estate invalidated the whole act The corporation tax law is therefore not unconstitutional as imposing an unapportioned direct tax except in so far as it im poses a tax on income derived from property and the unconstitu tionality of this portion of the law will not have the result of causing the whole law to be unconstitutional 2 The Constitution in Article I section 8 paragraph I pro vides that Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises    but all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States 653COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW Is now the tax on corporations uniform throughout the United States Several objections may be made to the corporation tax on the ground of its nonuniformity Thus the Act exempts from taxation certain specified kinds of corporations and all corporate incomes less than 5oo0 and permits the deduction of 50oo from all incomes above that amount in the ascertainment of the net income subjected to the tax It was claimed that the income tax law under consideration in the Pollock cases violated the uniformity principle in making exemptions similar to those made in the corporation tax law In the first Pollock case the Court was equally divided on the ques tion whether the income tax law violated the requirements for uniformity and in the second Pollock case it did not consider the question since it was able to base its decision on other grounds Since the decision of the Pollock cases however the Court has reached a decision as to the meaning of the uniformity pro vision In the case of Knowlton v MlooreO the contention was made that because a statute imposing an inheritance tax exempted legacies and distributed shares in personal property below ten thousand dollars because it classifies the rate of tax according to the relationship of the taker to the deceased and provides a rate progressing by the amount of the legacy or share therefore the tax is repugnant to that portion of the first clause of section 8 of Article I of the Constitution which provides that duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States Mr Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court in this case This opinion which is an exhaustive one naturally considered among other things this contention and the decision is reached that the uniformity required by the Constitution is a geographical and not an intrinsic uniformity The Court says By the result then of an analysis of the history of the adoption of the Constitution it becomes plain that the words uniform throughout the United States do not signify intrinsic but geo graphical uniformity According to this decision a tax is constitutional from the viewpoint of the uniformity clause even if it selects a specific class of objects persons processes or operations provided its effect on those objects persons processes or operations is the same in all parts of the United States where those objects and persons are found and those operations and processes take place I9oo 178 U S 41 654UNITED STATES CORPORATION TAX It may therefore safely be said that the corporation tax is not unconstitutional because violative of the uniformity clause and that on that account and because not a direct tax in so far as it imposes a tax on the income derived from business it is not forbidden by the express provisions of the Constitution limiting the taxing powers of Congress Second Is the corporation tax however forbidden by the limitations of the Constitution derived from the general theory of Federal governtment Early in the history of the Constitution Chief Justice Marshall laid down a fundamental principle derived from the federal char acter of our government whose application has limited the taxing power of the States on the one hand and of the Congress of the United States on the other hand The first case in which this was done was as is well known the great case of McCullough v Marylandl0 In this case Marshall assumed that a federal gov ernment is necessarily based on the existence of two governmental organizations on the one hand a national government on the other the State governments that each of these governments has powers recognized by the Constitution as belonging to it the exercise of which cannot be hindered or hampered by the other and that as the power to tax is the power to destroy neither government can use its taxing powers so as to interfere with the exercise of its recognized powers by the other government He says If we apply the principle for which the State of Maryland contends to the Constitution generally we shall find it capable of changing totally the character of that instrument We shall find it capable of arresting all the measures of the government and of prostrating it at the foot of the States The American people have declared their Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof to be supreme but this principle would transfer the supremacy in fact to the States If the States may tax one instrument employed by the govern ment in the execution of its powers they may tax any and every other instrument They may tax the mail they may tax the mint they may tax patent rights they may tax the papers of the custom house they may tax judicial process they may tax all the means employed by the government to an excess which would defeat all the ends of government This was not intended by the American people They did not design to make their government dependent on the States The conception of Federal government however involves as has been said the existence not merely of the national but as well 1I819 4 Wheat 316 432 655COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW of the State governments The Supreme Court has therefore held in a series of cases beginning with The Collector v Day1 that the United States may not tax a necessary instrumentality of State government or hamper or interfere with the exercise by the States of a power recognized as theirs by the United States Constitution In The Collector v Day holding that the United States might not tax the salary of a judicial officer of a State Mr Justice Nelson says The general government and the States although both exist within the same territorial limits are separate and distinct sov ereignties acting separately and independently of each other within their respective spheres The former in its appropriate sphere is supreme but the States within the limits of their powers not granted or in the language of the tenth amendment reserved are as independent of the general government as that government within its sphere is independent of the States    Such being the separate and independent condition of the States in our complex system as recognized by the Constitution and the exist ence of which is so indispensable that without them the general government itself would disappear from the family of nations it would seem to follow as a reasonable if not a necessary conse quence that the means and instrumentalities employed for carry ing on the operations of their governments for preserving their existence and fulfilling the high and responsible duties assigned to them in the Constitution should be left free and unimpaired should not be liable to be crippled much less defeated by the tax ing power of another government which power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax Applying this principle it has been held or said in later cases that the United States may not tax the obligations of indebted ness of Statesl2 or of the municipal corporations within the States13 the property of municipal corporations 4 or the bonds required from applicants for licenses to sell liquor under the licensing laws of a Statel6 There are thus many well considered cases decided by the Supreme Court which would seem to lay down the rule that the United States Congress may not use its taxing power so as to destroy or impair a power recognized as belonging to the States There is however a rather recent case which it must be I870 ii Wall 113 124 I25 Mercantile Nat Bk v New York 1887 I2I U S 138 162 ap proved in the first Pollock case supra The first Pollock case supra 1U S v Railroad Co I872 17 Wall 322 Ambrosini v U S I902 187 U S I 656UNITED STATES CORPORATION TAX confessed seriously limits the application of this principle This case is South Carolina v United States6 In this case the ques tion was raised as to the power of the United States to tax the State dispensaries of South Carolina The court decided that the tax was proper and based its decision on two grounds The first is that a recognition of the immunity of the State dispensaries from taxation might easily lead to the destruction of the taxing powers of the United States For as Mr Justice Brewer says The profits from the business in the year I90I as appears from the findings of fact were over half a million of dollars Mingling the thought of profit with the necessity of regulation may induce the State to take possession in like manner of tobacco oleomargarine and all other objects of internal revenue tax If one State finds it thus profitable other States may follow and the whole body of internal revenue tax be thus stricken down More than this There is a large and growing movement in the country in favor of the acquisition and management by the public of what are termed public utilities including not merely therein the supply of gas and water but also the entire railroad system Would the State by taking into possession these public utilities lose its republican form of government We may go even a step further There are some insisting that the State shall become the owner of all property and the manager of all business Of course this is an extreme view but its advocates are earnestly contending that thereby the best in terests of all citizens will be subserved If this change should be made in any State how much would that State contribute to the revenue of the Nation If this extreme action is not to be counted among the probabilities consider the result of one much less so Suppose a State assumes under its police power the con trol of all those matters subject to the internal revenue tax and also engages in the business of importing all foreign goods The same argument which would exempt the sale by a State of liquor tobacco etc from a license tax would exempt the importation of merchandise by a State from import duty While the State might not prohibit importations as it can the sale of liquor by private individuals yet paying no import duty it could undersell all indi viduals and so monopolize the importation and sale of foreign goods Obviously if the power of the State is carried to the extent suggested and with it is relief from all Federal taxation the National Government would be largely crippled in its revenues Indeed if all the States should concur in exercising their powers to the full extent it would be almost impossible for the Nation to collect any revenues In other words in this indirect way it would be within the competency of the States to practically destroy the efficiency of the National Government io05 I99 U S 437 454 455 457 458 65YCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW In the second place the court regards the matter from a his torical point of view Looking therefore at the Constitution in the light of the conditions surrounding at the time of its adoption it is obvious that the framers in granting full power over license taxes to the National Government meant that that power should be complete and never thought that all the States by extending their functions could practically destroy it If we look upon the Constitution in the light of the common law we are led to the same conclusion All the avenues of trade were open to the individual The Government did not attempt to exclude him from any Whatever restraints were put upon him were mere police regulations to control his conduct in the business and not to exclude him therefrom The Government was no competitor nor did it assume to carry on any business which ordinarily is carried on by individuals Indeed every at tempt at monopoly was odious in the eyes of the common law and it mattered not how that monopoly arose whether from grant of the sovereign or otherwise The framers of the Constitution were not anticipating that a State would attempt to monopolize any business heretofore carried on by individuals Can South Carolina v United States fairly be said so to modify the rule as to the power of the United States to tax the agencies or powers of the State government as to cause us to conclude that the United States may tax a State corporation if it is con ceded that such a tax will be in its essence a tax on a constitutional power of a State It is believed that this effect can hardly be attributed to this case and for the following reasons In the first place the denial of the right to tax such corpora tions may not be said to imperil the revenue powers of the national government For the government has been recognized as having the right to tax the income from business of all persons both individuals and corporations engaged in a taxable business1 In the second place the State power which under such con ditions would be taxed by the new corporation tax law is not a power like the power to establish a monopoly of the sale of liquor which has only recently been exercised by a State but is one which on the contrary was exercised by the States before the adoption of the Constitution and has been exercised continuously and with out interruption by them ever since with the approval expressed times without number of the Supreme Court It would not seem conceivable therefore that the Supreme Court could regard South Carolina v United States as justifying it in recognizing the cor 658UNITED STATES CORPORATION TAX poration tax law as constitutional if it believed that the law taxes one of the powers of the State Congress has evidently feared that its action in imposing a tax on corporations would be considered improper as imposing a tax on a power of the States For it has gone out of its way to declare that the tax is a special excise tax undoubtedly appre hending that in default of such expression the tax might be regarded as a corporation tax and therefore as interfering with a power of State government But it cannot be assumed that the Supreme Court will permit its judgment of the character of the tax to be controlled by such a statement on the part of Congress it will be governed in its determination by the true nature of the tax Indeed the Court said in Knowlton v Moore In the course of the opinion in the Pollock case it was said that if a tax was direct within the constitutional sense the mere erroneous qualification of it as an excise or duty would not take it out of the constitutional requirement as to apportionment    This language was    a statement that a tax which was in itself direct because imposed upon property solely by reason of its ownership could not be changed by affixing to it the qualification of excise or duty17 In coming to its conclusion as to the nature of the corporation tax the Supreme Court will not find many if any precedents upon the exact point at issue The most important case to be considered will unquestionably be Pacific Insurance Company v Soule which upheld as constitutional as has been said a tax levied on insurance premiums The law in this case however differed from the present law in that it imposed the tax on every insurance company and every association or individual engaged in the business of in surance 18 while the law we are considering is confined to cor porations The law at issue in the Pacific Insurance Company case might because of its application to all persons individuals as well as corporations engaged in the insurance business well be regarded as an excise or business tax and not a corporation tax although this point is not even referred to by the Court which confines its attention altogether to the determination of the ques tion whether the tax was direct or not The present corporation tax law affects corporations only and may therefore well be re garded as a corporation tax by a court which has in a number of Knowlton v Moore I9oo 178 U S 41 8I 13 U S Statutes at Large 276 659COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW cases upheld a State tax on the dividends or amount of business of domestic corporations as a corporate franchise tax19 If the tax under consideration were regarded as a corporate franchise tax there would be a danger that it might be regarded as a tax on a power of the States There has however been a marked tendency on the part of the Supreme Court in its tax cases to distinguish between the exercise of a power by a State which it recognizes may not be taxed by Congress and the con crete effects of the exercise of the power through the cooperation voluntary or involuntary on the part of individuals which effects it considers taxable by Congress One of the first of the cases in which such a distinction is hinted at is the License Tar Cases20 In this case the Supreme Court held that Congress could impose a tax on persons who actually were engaged in an occupation prohibited by the law of a State The only question before the Court was whether the law of Congress imposing the tax could be regarded as legalizing an occupation which by the State law was illegal The Court in reach ing its determination distinguished between the police power which was possessed and in the particular case exercised by the State and the taxing power which was possessed by the United States and whose exercise in the case before the Court was held not to have interfered with the States police power The question did not arise and therefore was not decided as to the power of the United States to tax an occupation licensed by the State but as a matter of fact Congress has for many years and without objec tion on the part of the States been doing this very thing It is however to be noticed that in two cases the Supreme Court has denied the right of the State to tax an occupation which has been licensed by the United States21 In both these cases a city ordi nance imposing a license tax on steam vessels engaged in the tow ing business was declared to be unconstitutional since the vessels concerned had been in accordance with a law of Congress already licensed by the United States The most important if not the first case in which the dis tinction referred to was made is however Knowlton v Moore Society for Savings v Coite 1867 6 Wall 594 Provident Institution v Mass I867 Ibid 611 Hamilton Company v Mass I867 Ibid 632 Home Ins Co v N Y ISg9 I34 U S 594 2I866 5 Wall 462 Moran v New Orleans 1884 r12 U S 69 Harman v Chicago I893 I47 U S 396 660UNITED STATES CORPORATION TAX to which reference has been already made in another connection This case it will be remembered upheld the constitutionality of a tax imposed by the United States on inheritances Among the objections made to the tax was the contention that the United States was taxing rights created solely by state law depending for their continued existence on the consent of the several states a volition which Congress has no power to control and as to which it could not therefore exercise its taxing authority The court considers this contention as unsound for three reasons First it denies to Congress the right to tax a subjectmatter which was conceded to be within the scope of its power very early in the history of the government    It is moreover worthy of remark that similar taxes have at other periods and for a con siderable time been enforced and although their constitutionality was assailed on other grounds held unsound by this Court the question of want of authority of Congress to levy a tax on in heritances and legacies was never urged against the acts in ques tion Second All courts and all governments however    conceive that the transmission of property occasioned by death al though differing from the tax on property as such is nevertheless a usual subject of taxation Of course in considering the power of Congress to impose death duties we eliminate all thought of a greater privilege to do so than exists as to any other form of taxation as the right to regulate successions is vested in the States and not in Congress Thi d the contention itself rests on the fallacy that the tax on the transmission or receipt of property oc casioned by death is imposed on the exclusive power of the State to regulate the devolution of property upon death The thing form ing the universal subject of taxation upon which inheritance and legacy taxes rest is the transmission or receipt and not the right existing to regulate In legal effect then the proposition upon which the argument rests is that wherever a right is subject to exclusive regulation by either the government of the United States on the one hand or the several States on the other the exercise of such rights as regulated can alone be taxed by the government having the mission to regulate But when it is ac curately stated the proposition denies the authority of the States to tax objects which are confessedly within the reach of their taxing power and also excludes the national government from almost every subject of direct and many acknowledged objects of indirect taxation Thus imports are exclusively within the taxing power of Congress Can it be said that the property when im ported and commingled with the goods of the State cannot be 661COLUMIBIA LAW REVIEW taxed because it had been at some prior time the subject of ex clusive regulation by Congress Again interstate commerce is often within the exclusive regulating power of Congress Can it be asserted that the property of all persons or corporations engaged in such commerce is not the subject of taxation by the several States because Congress may regulate interstate commerce Con veyances mortgages leases pledges and indeed all property and the contracts which arise from its ownership are subject more or less to state regulation exclusive in its nature If the propo sition here contended for be sound such property or dealings in relation thereto cannot be taxed by Congress even in the form of a stamp duty It cannot be doubted that the argument when reduced to its essence demonstrates its own unsoundness since it leads to the necessary conclusion that both the National and State governments are divested of those powers of taxation which from the foundation of the government admittedly have belonged to them Certainly a tax placed upon an inheritance or legacy diminishes to the extent of the tax the value of the right to inherit or receive but this is a burden cast upon the recipient and not upon the power of the State to regulate22 Assuming that the arguments are sound how do they affect the new corporation tax The first viz that a tax is constitu tional because it has been imposed since the beginning of the gov ernment does not apply because this is the first time Congress has imposed a tax on corporations as corporations and not as individ uals engaged in a taxable business Nor does the second apply since corporations as such have not been nearly as generally sub jects of taxation as inheritances But what shall be said as to the third argument Do the same reasons which justify the taxation by the United States of inheritances permitted by a State law justify the taxation by that government of corporations organized under State law To answer this question we must first determine what the law attempts to tax in other words what from the legal point of view is the incidence of the tax As the tax is not imposed as was the tax considered in Pacific Insurance Company v Soile on corporations and individuals engaged in a business which has been selected for taxation it must be admitted as has been inti mated that the tax is not a tax on business On the contrary it is imposed on all corporations organized for profit and insurance companies As it is not imposed on corporations and individuals nor on corporations engaged in a particular line of business except in the case of insurance companies but on corporations organized Knowlton v Moore I9oo x78 U S 4I 5660 662UNITED STATES CORPORATION TAX for profit we can hardly escape the conclusion that the reason for imposing the tax is that the person taxed is a corporation and that the legal incidence of the tax is upon corporations as such and therefore upon corporate franchises Such must be our con clusion after reading cases like Home Insurance Company v New York Society for Savings v Coite Provident Institution v Massa chusetts and Hamilton Manufacturing Company v Massa chusettsl0 where the Supreme Court reaches the conclusion that what is taxed by a law imposing a tax on corporations measured in amount by the dividends declared by the average amount of deposits or the market value of its stock is the corporate fran chise Now the corporate franchise is defined as the right or privilege given by the State to two or more persons of being a corporation that is of doing business in a corporate capacity 23 It may perhaps be said that because the corporation tax especially exempts certain corporations organized by the States and taxes corporations organized by the United States and by foreign countries it may not be regarded as directed specially against franchises granted by the State The mere exemption of certain specified corporations cannot be taken as in any way sig nificant since the exempt class embraces merely philanthropic charitable and benevolent corporations which are not usually liable in any system of taxation The nondiscriminating character of a tax has also been held in most instances to have no significance in determining its constitutionality provided the legal incidence of the tax is actually upon the prohibited object24 It may also be said that the new corporation tax is measured by the amount of the net earnings This cannot affect the case since in one of the cases referred to coming up from New York viz The Home Itnsurance Co caseTl the Court held that measur ing the tax by the dividends which are in essence equivalent to net earnings paid did not make the tax a tax on the capital stock or property of the corporation and that therefore it was not neces sary to deduct in reaching the amount of the tax the interest re ceived on the bonds of the United States owned by the corporation Can it now be said that the corporation tax as a tax on the corporate franchises of corporations organized by State laws taxes one of the powers of the State governments Home Ins Co v N Y supra Bank of Commerce v New York City I862 2 Black 620 Low v Austin r871 13 Wall 29 Robbins v Shelby County Taxing Dist 1887 I20 U S 489 663COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW One of the powers which have been recognized from the be ginning of our history as peculiarly a power of the State govern ments is the power to create corporations It is a power further which has been recognized by the Supreme Court which has said time and again and in no uncertain way that the creation and existence of a domestic corporation is a matter entirely within the discretion of a State so far as the latters action does not violate the constitutional provision forbidding a State to pass any law impairing the obligation of a contract25 It has also been held that a State may not tax a corporation legally chartered by the United States This principle was at the basis of McCullough v Maryland in which it was held that a State could not impose a tax on the United States Bank and has been reaffirmed in a series of cases with regard to the power of the States to tax the national banks one of the latest and most important of which is Owensboro National Bank v Owensboro2 In this case the Court considered the constitutionality of a State law providing that every incor porated bank    shall in addition to the other taxes im posed on it by law annually pay a tax on its franchise to the state The Court held that assuming that the tax actually im posed on the bank was a tax on its franchise it was void as repugnant to the Act of Congress providing under the Constitu tion of the United States that national banks should not be taxed by the States but that the shares of national bank stock might be taxed in the hands of the holders But does it follow from these decisions that State taxes on banks incorporated by the United States are improper that United States taxes on corporations organized under State laws are improper It would seem not For a State tax on banks incorporated by the United States was improper not so much because it was upon a corporate franchise granted by the United States but because the particular corpora tion upon which it was levied was in addition to being a corpora tion chartered by the United States an instrument or agent of the United States formed not merely to do business for its incor porators but to aid the United States government in the perform ance of one of its constitutional duties This it must be con fessed cannot be said of the corporations organized for profit under a State law These corporations may have been formed through the exercise of a power which is recognized as belonging 2See e g Horn Silver Mining Co v N Y I892 143 U S 305 i809 I73 U S 664 664UNITED STATES CORPORATION TAX to the States but have not been formed for the purpose of aiding the States in the discharge of their governmental functions Therefore the United States Bank and the National Bank tax cases may not be said to be applicable even if we admit that the United States and the States are governed by the same rules in the exercise of the right to tax the results of the exercise of each others powers The only reason for holding that the United States may not tax a corporate franchise granted by a State is then to be found in the fact that because the power to tax is the power to destroy the United States may in this way destroy one of the States powers In their determination as to the powers of the States to tax the effects or results of the exercise by the United States of its powers the State courts have been governed by this idea They have therefore held that the States may not tax letters patent or copyrights issued by the United States27 But the Supreme Court of the United States has not up to the present time been equally regardful of the powers of the States It has in Knowlton v Moore recognized the right of the United States to impose a tax on inheritances which it has regarded as the effects of the exer cise of the power of the State to regulate inheritances while Con gress has without opposition and for a long time probably be cause of the decision in the Licentse Tax Cases imposed a special excise tax on the holders of State licenses to sell liquor notwith standing the Supreme Court has denied the right of the States to tax steamboats licensed by the United States to use the navi gable waters of the United States Indeed the only cases where the Supreme Court has interfered to protect the States against the exercise of the taxing power of Congress have been in the cases of the salaries of State officers the evidences of indebted ness of the States and their local corporations and the property of the States and their local corporations where in its opinion that property is used for a necessary purpose of State govern ment and liquor license bonds required under a State liquor license law The Supreme Court may not thus be said to have been active in the defense of the powers of the States against congressional action It is therefore very doubtful if it will regard the corpora People v Assessors I898 156 N Y 417 People v Roberts I899 r59 N Y 70

of Federal government are recognized as belonging to the States The answer to the question as to the constitutionality of the United States corporation tax would seem then to be that it is constitutional except in so far as it imposes a tax on income de rived from property Except as to that portion of it it is not a direct tax and therefore need not be apportioned among the States It is uniform throughout the United States and it would appear not to violate the obligation of Congress arising out of the theory of Federal government not to interfere with the powers of the States FRANK

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009337,THE TERMS AND TENOR OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY,I242530,ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE THE TERMS AND TENOR OF THE CLAYTON BULWER TREATY THE APPROACHING POLITICAL CRISIS IN THE FAR EAST AND THE RECENT SPANISHAMERICAN WAR HAVE JOINTLY CONTRIBUTED SHARPLY TO DEFINE CERTAIN HERETOFORE UNFORMULATED PRINCIPLES OF ANGLOSAXON POLICY IT IS NOW RECOGNIZED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS COMPLETED HER DOMESTIC NOVITIATE AND IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HER APPOINTED CAREER IN THE FOREIGN POLITICS OF THE PACIFIC IN ACKNOWLEDG ING THUS INFORMALLY THE NEWLY ATTAINED MAJORITY OF THE JUNIOR NATION BOTH BRANCHES OF THE ANGLOSAXON RACE HAVE FURTHERMORE COME TO REALIZE THAT THE DAYS OF BROTHERLY BICKERING ARE PAST AND THAT HENCEFORTH THE MORE DIGNIFIED RELATIONS OF DIPLOMATIC EQUALITY MUST PREVAIL TO EACH OF THESE GENERAL PROPOSITIONS A PARTICULAR COROLLARY PERTAINS IN VIEW OF THE SUDDEN EXTENSION OF THE AMERICAN FRONTIER SO FAR ACROSS THE PACIFIC THE STRATEGIC NECESSITY IS PERFECTLY APPARENT OF PROVIDING MORE ADEQUATE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION THAN AT PRESENT EXIST BETWEEN THE OUTLYING ISLAND POSSESSIONS OF THE UNITED STATES AND HER MAINLAND POLITICAL BASE IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PROBABILITY THAT GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES WILL PURSUE IN THE 285 NO V I8992 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FUTURE A PARALLEL POLITICAL COURSE THE EXPEDIENCY IS EQUALLY OBVIOUS OF THE TWO POWERS AGREEING AT THE OUTSET UPON THE DIPLOMATIC RULES OF THE ROAD THUS BY A NATURAL CONCAT ENATION OF EVENTS AND THROUGH A LOGICAL CONNECTION OF IDEAS TWO IMPORTANT SUBJECTS HAVE RECENTLY COME UP FOR DISCUSSION IN ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES INTEROCEANIC COMMUNICATION AND INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE SOME FIFTY YEARS AGO A DIFFERENT SEQUENCE OF FACTS SET A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TRAIN OF IDEAS IN THE SAME GENERAL DIREC TION AND RESULTED EVENTUALLY IN THE FORMULATION OF A DEFINITE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS UPON BOTH THESE POINTS WHICH THOUGH PROVING OF NO PRACTICAL AVAIL IS STILL THEO RETICALLY IN FORCE THERE ARE THEREFORE LOGICAL GROUNDS IF THE PRINCIPLES OF HISTORICAL CONSISTENCY ARE TO PREVAIL FOR DEMANDING A STAY IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MOMENT UNTIL THE PLEAS OF THE PRESENT BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH THE DECISIONS OF THE PAST PERTINENT IN OTHER WORDS TO THE PRESENT PROPOSALS FOR AN ISTHMUS CANAL AND AN ANGLO AMERICAN UNDERSTANDING ARE THE TERMS AND TENOR OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY THE SUPERFICIAL CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO THE RATIFICATION OF THIS ANTIQUATED CONVENTION WERE UNLIKE THOSE NOW MAKING TOWARD A SIMILAR EXPRESSION OF IDEAS BUT UPON A DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SUBJECT THE VARIATION DIMINISHES AND BOTH GROUPS OF FACTS ARE SEEN TO PROCEED PRIMARILY FROM THE SAME GENERAL PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT COGNIZANCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THIS PROGRESSION PROMISES CONSEQUENTLY TO RECONCILE THE PRESENT DIVERGENCE OF IDEAS ON THE QUESTIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LEAD THE AP PROACHING DISCUSSION ALONG A MORE PROFITABLE PATH LOOKING BACK ALONG THE TREND OF HISTORICAL EVENTS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT WITH EUROPE AS ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE THE COURSE OF COMMERCIAL CIVILIZATION HAS PROCEEDED IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE GLOBE THROUGH ASIA AND AROUND AFRICA TOWARD THE EAST AND OVER THE ATLANTIC TO AMERICA ON THE WEST 286THE CLAYTONBULWER TRBATY MARITIME PROGRESS IN EITHER DIRECTION WAS ORIGINALLY OPPOSED BY CONTINENTAL MASSES CONTRACTING AT TWO POINTS TO ISTHMUS CONNECTIONS ON THE EAST THE LANDS OF PROMISE EXTENDED FAR BEYOND THE BARRIER BUT TO THE WEST AN UNDE VELOPED CONTINENT LAY OPEN TO ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION DIRECTLY FROM THE ATLANTIC ACCESS TO THE PACIFIC WAS CONSEQUENTLY THE CONDITION PRECEDENT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE EASTERN MOVE MENT WHEREAS ON THE WEST THERE WAS NO SUCH IMMEDIATE NECESSITY FOR INTEROCEANIC COMMUNICATION THE EASTERLY CURRENT OF COMMERCE WAS FURTHERMORE CONFRONTED BY COM PACT NATIVE POPULATIONS WHICH DIVERTED THE MAIN STREAM AND COMPELLED THE EUROPEANS TO APPROACH THE SOUTH SEA BY SKIRTING THE SHORES OF THE CONTINENTS FOR THIS REASON INTER EUROPEAN CONTEST HAS BEEN LONGER MAINTAINED ON THIS SIDE OF THE GLOBE NO COLONY HAS AS YET ESTABLISHED ITS INDEPEN DENCE ALONG THE EASTERLY ROUTE AND THE COMPLETE PARTITION OF THE CONTINENTS HAS YET TO BE EFFECTED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION THE ABORIGINES OF AMERICA OFFERED BUT SLIGHT RESIST ANCE TO THE ADVANCE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND OLD WORLD COMPETITION WAS CONSEQUENTLY AFFORDED A FAIR FIELD TO RUN ITS FULL COURSE TOWARD THE PACIFIC AS A RESULT EUROPEAN CON TROVERSY WAS REDUCED TO AN EARLIER ISSUE ALONG THIS LINE OF ADVANCE LEAVING INDEPENDENT REPUBLICS IN PRACTICAL POSSES SION OF THE FIELD THUS WHILE THE EASTERN MOVEMENT IS CHARACTERIZED HISTORICALLY BY EUROPEAN CONTEST AND NATIVE OPPOSITION THE ADVANCE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION IS TYPIFIED BY INDEPENDENT PROGRESS ALONG AN UNIMPEDED COURSE THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS ENCOUNTERED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE HAVE NATURALLY GIVEN TO EACH OF THESE CURRENTS OF PROGRESS AN HISTORICAL BENT OF ITS OWN WITH THE RESULT THAT MODERN CIVILIZATION IS TRADITIONALLY DIVIDED TO THE PREJUDICE OF GEOGRAPHIC PREVISION BUT THE DIVERSITY IS AFTER ALL TRANSITORY FOR OWING TO THE SPHERICITY OF THE EARTH THE TWO COURSES OF COMMERCE ARE ULTIMATELY DESTINED TO BE MERGED INTO ONE PROCEEDING FROM THE PREMISES OF GEOGRAPHY IT IS THEREFORE OBVIOUSLY ILLOGICAL TO CONSIDER EITHER COMMERCIAL 287J 34 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MOVEMENT AS AN ISOLATED PHENOMENON INDEED THE TRADI TIONAL SEPARATION OF THE FACTORS ACCOUNTS IN GREAT MEASURE FOR THE CONFUSION STILL SURROUNDING THE SUBJECT UNDER DISCUS SION IN ORDER TO PRESENT THE PROBLEM OF INTEROCEANIC COM MUNICATION IN ITS LOGICAL LIGHT IT WILL BE BETTER TO POSTULATE THE COMMON ORIGIN AND END OF COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MAKE PROPER HISTORICAL ALLOWANCE BY THE WAY FOR THE DIFFERENT TRADITIONAL STANDPOINTS OF THE PAST REPRESENTING THE EARLIER COLUMBIAN HYPOTHESIS SPAIN REGARDED AMERICA ORIGINALLY AS A BARRIERLAND BEFORE ASIA AND HER PRIMARY EFFORTS WERE ACCORDINGLY DIRECTED TOWARD THE DISCOVERY OF THE WESTERLY STRAIT TO THE INDIES BUT GEOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS PRECLUDED SO PREMATURE AN APPLICATION OF THE GEOMETRIC THEORY AND THE SUFFICIENCY OF HER NEW WORLD POSSESSIONS GRADUALLY RESTRICTED SPAINS ATTENTION TO THE WEST FROM THE LATER SPANISH POINT OF VIEW ISTHMUS TRANSIT CAME ACCORDINGLY TO BE REGARDED AS A PURELY LOCAL EXPEDIENT FOR THE BETTER DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN RESOURCES ENGLAND MEANWHILE WAS MAKING EQUAL PROGRESS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AND FROM HER INSULAR VANTAGEGROUND WAS ABLE DISTANTLY TO FORESEE THE ULTIMATE UNION OF HER EASTERLY AND WESTERLY TRADE ROUTES WITH THIS FAROFF END IN VIEW POSSES SION OF THE AMERICAN ISTHMUS EARLY BECAME A SETTLED PRINCI PLE OF BRITISH POLITICS IN THE WORDS OF WILLIAM PATERSON AN ENTHUSIAST OF THE TIME THIS DOOR OF THE SEAS THIS KEY OF THE UNIVERSE WITH ANYTHING OF A REASONABLE MANAGE MENT WILL ENABLE ITS PROPRIETORS TO GIVE LAWS TO BOTH OCEANS AND BECOME ARBITRATORS OF THE COMMERCIAL WORLD  THUS WHEN IN THE COURSE OF COLONIAL CONTROVERSY THE SPHERES OF BRITISH AND SPANISH INFLUENCE CAME TOGETHER IN THE CARIBBEAN A STRUGGLE WAS NATURALLY ENGENDERED BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS FOR PREDOMINANCE AMONG THE WEST INDIAN ISLANDS AND AFTER COMPARATIVE INSULAR EQUALITY HAD BEEN SECURED THE CONTEST WAS CONTINUED FOR ASCENDANCY ALONG THE SPANISH MAIN PRIOR DISCOVERY AND FORMAL OCCUPATION GAVE SPAIN A LEGAL TITLE TO THE CENTRAL AMERICAN MAINLAND 288THE CLAYTONBUIWER TREATY BUT HER SETTLEMENTS WERE PRACTICALLY CONFINED TO THE WEST AND EXCEPT FOR ONE OR TWO SPANISH EXPORT STATIONS ALONG THE CARIBBEAN SHORE THE EASTERN SEABOARD LAY INVITINGLY OPEN TO FOREIGN ENCROACHMENT ENGLISH BUCCANEERS NATU RALLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS UNEXPECTED WEAKNESS IN THEIR ADVERSARIES DEFENSIVE POSITION AND SHORTLY SUCCEEDED IN SECURING SEVERAL FOOTHOLDS ALONG THE COASTS OF YUCATAN AND NICARAGUA AND IN THE BAY ISLANDS OFF HONDURAS WHEN FREEBOOTING BECAME NO LONGER PROFITABLE THESE BUCCANEERING ESTABLISHMENTS WERE TRANSFORMED INTO LOGGERS CAMPS AND IN DEFENCE OF SUCH PEACEFUL OCCUPATIONS GREAT BRITAIN COULD CLAIM CERTAIN RESERVED RIGHTS FOR HER SUBJECTS ALONG THE CARIBBEAN SHORE SPAIN CONTENTED HERSELF WITH FORMAL PROTESTS AGAINST THESE OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS AND DURING THE BRIEF INTERMITTENT PERIODS OF PEACE THE MATTER WAS TWICE THEORETICALLY ADJUSTED BY THE TREATY OF AIXLACHAPELLE 1748 AND BY THE TREATY OF PARIS 1763 BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THE ENGLISH SETTLERS CONTINUED TO EXTEND THEIR HOLDINGS UNTIL THE OUTBREAK OF THE REVOLUTIONARY CONTEST UPON THE REVOLT OF HER NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES GREAT BRITAIN FORESAW THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING CUT OFF ENTIRELY FROM FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARD THE WEST TO AVOID SO SERIOUS A CONTINGENCY A NAVAL FORCE WAS GATHERED IN THE WEST INDIES AND NELSON WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE SETTLERS OF THE SHORE MADE A BOLD DASH FOR THE PACIFIC THROUGH NICARAGUA AN UNTOWARD SERIES OF ACCIDENTSIN WHICH TROPICAL FEVER COUNTED FOR CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN SPANISH VALORTHWARTED THE SUCCESS OF THIS EXPEDITION AND TO ACCENTUATE THE DIFFICULTY ENGLAND WAS AT THE SAME TIME OBLIGED TO ADMIT DEFEAT IN THE NORTH DESPITE THE FAILURE OF HER IMMEDIATE PLANS IN THE FINAL ADJUSTMENT OF AMERICAN AFFAIRS IN 1783 GREAT BRITAIN NEVER THELESS RETAINED IMPORTANT TERRITORIAL PREROGATIVES IN THE NEW WORLD THROUGH CANADA FURTHER PROGRESS WAS STILL POS SIBLE TOWARD THE PACIFIC AND HER STRATEGIC POSITION BEFORE 289 56 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE ISTHMUS WAS NOT SERIOUSLY DISTURBED OWING TO THE RELATIVE REDUCTION OF HER EUROPEAN ADVERSARIES THE BALANCE OF WEST INDIAN POWER WAS ACTUALLY IN HER FAVOR AND AS HER SETTLERS WERE GRANTED VESTED RIGHTS IN YUCATAN BELIZE AND GUIANA NOW AFFORDED TWO IMPORTANT POINTS DAPPUI ALONG THE SPANISH MAIN TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE FUTURE ROUTE OF INTEROCEANIC COMMUNICATION THROUGH THEIR SUCCESSFUL STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE AND BY THEIR SUBSEQUENT DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES THE NORTH AMERICAN COLONISTS ON THEIR SIDE FELL HEIRS TO A DOUBLE INHERITANCE FROM THE MOTHER COUNTRY THEY OBTAINED BY RIGHT OF REDEMPTION THE BETTER PART OF THE NORTHERN CONTINENT AND AS THE SELFAPPOINTED GUARDIANS OF THE MINOR REPUBLICS OF THE SOUTH THEY ALSO BECAME THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FORMER PRIVILEGES OF SPAIN THINKING OF THE OLD WORLD FROM WHICH THEY HAD WITH SUCH DIFFICULTY DETACHED THEM SELVES AS BELONGING ENTIRELY TO THE PAST AND BELIEVING WITH BERKELEY THAT THE COURSE OF EMPIRE WAS EXCLUSIVELY TOWARD THE WEST AMERICANS CAME HENCEFORTH TO REGARD THE NEW WORLD AS THE ULTIMA THULE OF PROGRESS AND GAVE BUT PASS ING THOUGHT IN THESE EARLY DAYS OF THEIR INDEPENDENCE TO THE CORRESPONDING CURRENT OF CIVILIZATION SETTING IN TOWARD THE EAST WITH WHICH THEY WERE MANIFESTLY DESTINED EVENTUALLY TO COME INTO CONTACT IT WAS NATURAL THEREFORE WITH THIS RESTRICTED HORIZON THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CONTINUE THE SPANISH TRADITION OF THE TRANSIT QUESTION AND FROM THE OUTSET REGARD THE PROJECT OF INTEROCEANIC COMMUNI CATION AS A PURELY LOCAL EXPEDIENT FOR THE AMELIORATION OF THEIR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FROM HER EXTENDED EXPERIENCE ENGLAND ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ABLE TO TAKE AN EVEN MORE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THE SITUATION THAN BEFORE BY PERSISTENT STRUGGLE SHE HAD MANAGED TO MAINTAIN HER POSI TION IN THE FOREFRONT OF EITHER ADVANCE AND HER PROBLEMS WERE NOW SIMILAR ON BOTH SIDES OF THE GLOBE TO DEVELOP HER COLONIES ALONG EACH LINE OF PROGRESS AND CONNECT THE TWO CURRENTS OF COMMERCE BY OPENING THE EASTERN AND 290THI CLAYTONBULWER TREATY WESTERN GATEWAYS TO THE PACIFIC SUCH WAS HER IMPERIAL POLICY THUS AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD GREAT BRITAIN CAME TO REGARD AMERICA MORE AND MORE IN THE LIGHT OF A DURCHGANGSLAND WHILE THE UNITED STATES CONTINUED TO LOOK UPON THE NEW WORLD AS AN ISOLATED OIKOUMENE THE SUSPICION OF AN INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE CON TINENTAL COUNTRIES TO INTERFERE AGAIN IN THE UNSETTLED AFFAIRS OF SPANISH AMERICA WAS ENOUGH TO BRING THE WHOLE QUES TION UP FOR DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE POWERS PRIMARILY CON CERNED IN SPITE OF THE DIVERGENCE OF THEIR VIEWS THE TWO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WESTERN MOVEMENT HAD AT LEAST PRO CEEDED FROM A COMMON POINT OF DEPARTURE AND WERE ACCORD INGLY CONGRUENT IN THE CONVICTION THAT THE PROGRESSIVE ELIMINATION OF EUROPEAN POLITICS FROM AMERICA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FINAL AS FAR AS IT HAD GONE ON THE BASIS OF THIS EVIDENT AGREEMENT CANNING HOPED TO DRAW THE GOVERN MENTS TOGETHER IN A JOINT DECLARATION TO THIS EFFECT TO THE HOLY ALLIANCE BUT ADAMS WAS TOO FARSIGHTED TO ALLOW ANY SUCH PRELIMINARY ESTOPPEL TO BE PLACED UPON THE INDE PENDENT AMERICAN CLAIM JOINT ACTION TAKEN BY THE ANGLO SAXON POWERS AGAINST THE CONTINENT INVOLVED THE ADMISSION OF AT LEAST ONE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT INTO THE FUTURE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE NEW WORLD AND THIS WAS UTTERLY INADMISSIBLE TO THE AMERICAN MIND WHICH PERSISTED IN REGARDING THE OLD WORLD AS A UNIT OF POLITICAL POLICY CHOOSING THEREFORE TO BE THEORETICALLY CONSISTENT RATHER THAN PRACTICALLY REASONABLE THE UNITED STATES RESOLVED TO DECLARE ALONE AGAINST OLD WORLD INTERFERENCE AND ENGLAND FOUND HERSELF INCLUDED ACCORDINGLY WITHIN THE TERMS OF THE BAN BUT IN SPITE OF EUROPEAN FILIATIONS AND EASTERN CON NECTIONS GREAT BRITAIN WAS STILL A POWERFUL FACTOR IN THE POLITICS OF THE WEST AND BY THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES THE UNITED STATES WAS FURTHERMORE BOUND TO RECOGNIZE THESE RESERVED RIGHTS IN AMERICA IN THE HOPES OF AVOIDING THIS AWKWARD CONTRADICTION THE AMERICANS TOOK PAINS TO ADD A 29I 78 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CLAUSE TO THEIR DOCTRINE PROMISING NOT TO INTERFERE WITH EXISTING EUROPEAN DEPENDENCIES IN THE NEW WORLD BUT INASMUCH AS THEY STILL CLAIMED THE FUTURE ENTIRELY FOR THEM SELVES ENGLAND WAS APPARENTLY TO BE REDUCED TO A POSITION OF STATIC DESUETUDE ALONG THE LINE OF WESTERN PROGRESS AN ANOMALOUS SITUATION INDEED AND ONE BIG WITH THE POSSIBIL ITIES OF CONTROVERSY THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE LIKELIHOOD HOWEVER OF SERIOUS DIFFERENCES ARISING FROM THIS UNDERLYING CONTRADICTION OF THEORY AND FACT BECAUSE IT WAS FOR SOME TIME PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE FOR BOTH POWERS TO PURSUE THEIR WAY TOWARD THE WEST WITHOUT EITHER BEING IN A POSITION TO INTERFERE WITH THE ADVANCE OF THE OTHER THUS THE TWO NATIONS CONTINUED TO PARALLEL EACH OTHERS COURSE ACROSS THE CONTINENTGREAT BRITAIN WITH THE DEFINITE IDEA IN MIND OF JOINING HER WESTERLY OUTPOSTS WITH HER COLONIAL CONNECTIONS IN THE FAR EAST THE UNITED STATES MERELY MAKING TERRITORIAL PRO VISION FOR HER RAPIDLY INCREASING POPULATION SOME FRICTION WAS NATURALLY GENERATED ALONG THE LINE OF CONTACT BUT NEVER ENOUGH TO FIRE THE MAIN TRAIN OF CONTROVERSY AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE TWO POWERS CONTEMPORANEOUSLY REACHED THE PACIFIC THAT THE INHERENT DIVERSITY OF THEIR AIMS THREATENED TO RAISE THE REAL ISSUE IN PLANNING TO EFFECT A WESTERLY JUNCTION WITH HER ORIENTAL OUTPOSTS ENGLAND HAD NOT CONFINED HERSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO THE NORTH TRUE BY THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES 1783 AND AGAIN BY THE TREATY OF MADRID 1814 SHE HAD AGREED TO ABANDON HER PROMISING INTERESTS ALONG THE NICARAGUAN COAST AND CONFINE HER CENTRAL AMERICAN COLONISTS HENCEFORTH TO BELIZE BUT EVEN AT THE TIME THE DECISION HAD BEEN UNPOPULAR THE OPPONENTS OF THE WHIG MINISTRY MAINTAINING THAT IN THUS DESERTING HER MOSQUITO ALLIES GREAT BRITAIN WAS HANGING UP HER DEGRADATION IN EVERY COURT OF EUROPE  AND NOW THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN INHERITANCE OF SPANISH RIGHTS WAS LEGALLY IN DOUBT OPPORTUNITY WAS OFFERED TO RETRIEVE THIS ERROR OF THE PAST AND REVIVE THE BRITISH CLAIM 292THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY TO THE SHORE THE ENGLISH SETTLERS WERE AS EAGER AS EVER TO EXTEND THEIR DOMAIN AND AS THE INDIANS WERE STILL FRIENDLY DISPOSED THEY EXPERIENCED NO DIFFICULTY IN INCLUDING THE ENTIRE EASTERN COAST OF NICARAGUA NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE SAN JUAN WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE NEWLY CONSTITUTED KINGDOM OF MOSQUITIA WHICH WITH THE BAY ISLANDS WAS TO BE PLACED UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE SUPERINTENDENCY OF BELIZE BUT AS THE NICARAGUANS CONTINUED TO CONTROL THE OUTLET OF THE SAN JUAN THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF THE KING DOM WAS INCOMPLETE A PRELIMINARY ATTEMPT TO SEIZE THE PORT IN THE NAME OF THE MOSQUITO KING NATURALLY AROUSED RESISTANCE FROM THE INTERIOR AND AT THIS JUNCTURE IT WAS DEEMED ADVISABLE FOR THE HOME GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE TO PROVIDE A BASE OF OPERATIONS LORD PALMERSTON FIRST TOOK OCCASION TO ESTABLISH A REGULAR GOVERNMENT IN BELIZE FOL LOWING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF HIS CENTRAL AMERICAN AGENTS HE OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED THE SEIZURE OF THE BAY ISLANDS AND FINALLY INFORMED NICARAGUA THAT THE RIGHT OF THE MOSQUITO KING SHOULD BE MAINTAINED AS EXTENDING FROM CAPE HONDURAS DOWN TO THE MOUTH OF THE SAN JUAN AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO ANY RIGHTS OF THE MOSQUITO KING SOUTH OF THE SAN JUAN AS WAS EXPECTED THE CENTRAL AMERI CANS PROTESTED AGAINST THE THREATENED ENCROACHMENT WHERE UPON THE MOSQUITO MONARCH WAS PUT IN POSSESSION OF HIS RIGHTS WITH THE AID OF BRITISH MARINES NICARAGUA WAS THEN FORCED AT THE POINT OF THE BAYONET TO SIGN A TREATY ABANDON ING FOREVER ALL CLAIM TO THE MOUTH OF THE STREAM AND TO MAKE A POINT OF POSSESSION THE ENGLISH RECHRISTENED THE SETTLEMENT GREYTOWN THUS BY A PRUDENT EXERCISE OF DIPLOMACY AND FORCE GREAT BRITAIN SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN SECURING POSSESSION OF THE KEY TO THE WESTERN GATEWAY TO THE PACIFIC THIS WAS IN 1848 SHORTLY AFTER THE RIVAL AMERICAN CLAIMANTS HAD COME TO A DEFINITE AGREEMENT AS TO THE LINE OF TRANSCON TINENTAL DEMARCATION SEPARATING THEIR RESPECTIVE DOMINIONS IN THE NORTH DURING THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE DISCOVERY OF 293 91O ANNALS OF THB AMERICAN ACADEMY GOLD IN THE NEWLY ACQUIRED TERRITORY OF CALIFORNIA INDUCED A VERITABLE INRUSH OF POPULATION FROM THE EAST AND CLEARLY INDICATED THE IMPERATIVENESS OF PROVIDING BETTER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE SEPARATED SEACOASTS OF THE COUNTRY THAN THE TOILSOME JOURNEY ACROSS THE PLAINS OR THE PERILOUS VOYAGE AROUND THE HORN BY THE PRICK OF ECONOMIC NECESSITY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE ACCORDINGLY AROUSED TO THE PRESSING IMPORTANCE OF ISTHMUS TRANSIT BEING AS IT WERE THE GUARDIANS OF THE SOUTHERN REPUBLICS THE UNITED STATES FOUND EQUALLY READY SUPPORTERS ON THE ISTHMUS AND WITH THE CONTRIVANCE OF THE CENTRAL AMERI CANS SOON DEVELOPED A COUNTER SITUATION ALONG THE WESTERN SECTION OF THE TRANSIT ROUTE THAT PREJUDICED BRITISH PLANS AN AMERICAN COMPANY EASILY SECURED A CONCESSION TO CON STRUCT THE CANAL AND IN RETURN FOR A PROMISE TO GUARANTEE THE INTEGRITY OF NICARAGUAN TERRITORY FROM SEA TO SEA THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WAS ALSO GIVEN PERMISSION BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO FORTIFY AND CONTROL THE ROUTE ON OB JECTIONS BEING RAISED BY ENGLISH AGENTS TO THESE EXCLUSIVE PROVISIONS THE AMERICAN COMMISSIONER TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION STRAIGHTWAY OPENED NEGOTIATIONS WITH HONDURAS AND SUCCEEDED IN SECURING TEMPORARY POSSESSION FOR HIS GOVERNMENT OF TIGRE ISLAND WHICH GUARDED THE PACIFIC OUTLET OF THE PROPOSED CANAL MATTERS REACHED THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN I850 WITH ENGLAND IN POSSESSION OF THE ATLANTIC TERMINUS AND THE UNITED STATES IN CONTROL OF THE PACIFIC END OF THE LINE THE LEAST ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE LOCALLY CONSTITUTED CANAL COMPANY TO EXPLOIT ITS CONCESSION MUST NECESSARILY HAVE PRECIPITATED A CRISIS SINCE THE ENUNCIATION OF THE MONROE DOCTRINE NO CON TROVERSY HAD ARISEN BETWEEN THE AMERICAN RIVALS NOT AMENABLE TO COMPROMISE AND TICKLISH AS WERE THE TIMES IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE TO TURN THIS FRESH CRISIS WITHOUT RAISING THE REAL ISSUE PROVIDED PRESENT CONSIDERATIONS WERE ALONE ALLOWED TO PREVAIL BOTH POWERS WERE ANXIOUS TO AVOID AN 294THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY OPEN RUPTURE AT THIS PARTICULAR PERIOD ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THREATENED DISTURBANCES IN THE EAST AND THE UNITED STATES FOR REASONS OF DOMESTIC CONCERN AND EACH WAS WILLING TO COOPERATE WITH THE OTHER WITHIN THE LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE AMERICAN POLICIES OWING TO THEIR ANTI THETICAL ATTITUDE TOWARD THE GENERAL QUESTION THE CANAL PROBLEM PRESENTED A DIFFERENT ASPECT MOREOVER TO THE TWO PARTIES CONCERNED BEING PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED WITH THE ECONOMIC NECESSITY OF THE UNDERTAKING THE UNITED STATES FAILED AS YET TO APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL CON TROL TO GREAT BRITAIN ON THE OTLER HAND IT WAS A MATTER OF MUCH MORE MOMENT TO DOMINATE THE ROUTE THAN TO FURTHER THE FINANCES OF THE ENTERPRISE WHAT TO THE UNITED STATES APPEARED TO BE A PRESENT PROBLEM OF TRANSPORTATION INVOLVING INDUSTRIAL ADVANTAGE WAS TO ENGLAND A FACTOR OF FUTURE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE THAT TOUCHED THE TENETS OF HER FOREIGN POLICY BETWEEN THE IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC NEEDS OF ONE PARTY AND THE ULTIMATE POLITICAL DEMANDS OF THE OTHER A NARROW WAY WAS THEREFORE OPEN TO NEGOTIATION WITH CHARACTERISTIC ACUTENESS SIR HENRY BULWER POINTED OUT THE PATH AND IN RESPONDING TO THE CUE MR CLAYTON PROCEEDED SO PRECIPITATELY THAT HE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE REAL DIRECTION OF THE ROAD BEFORE REACHING THE REALM OF COMPROMISE AND COOPERATION CERTAIN DIPLOMATIC OBSTRUCTIONS HAD FIRST TO BE CLEARED AWAY THOUGH WILLING TO WAIVE ALL QUESTION OF EXCLUSIVE POLITICAL CONTROL FOLLOWING THE DICTATES OF THE MONROE DOCTRINE THE UNITED STATES WAS NEVERTHELESS OBLIGED TO INSIST UPON THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE BRITISH CLAIM TO THE CARIBBEAN COAST AS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO FURTHER NEGOTIA TION FORTUNATELY FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE DIPLOMATIC PRE LIMINARIES ENGLAND APPARENTLY SET NO FURTHER STORE BY THIS FEVERBREEDING STRIP OF SHORE LINE WHICH SHE HAD EVIDENTLY ACQUIRED MORE WITH A VIEW TO CONTROLLING THE WESTERN GATE WAY TO THE PACIFIC THAN FOR ITS OWN INTRINSIC WORTH AND IF THE END WERE OTHERWISE TO BE OBTAINED SHE WAS QUITE WILLING 295 II12 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TO ABANDON THE PROVISIONAL MEANS BEING A NAVAL POWER IT WAS NOT INDEED INCUMBENT UPON GREAT BRITAIN TO OCCUPY AND FORTIFY THE LAND PROVIDED OF COURSE HER RIVAL WOULD LIKEWISE CONSENT TO RETIRE FROM HER POSITION AND RENOUNCE ALL CLAIM TO THE CANAL ROUTE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEREFORE THE IMMEDIATE DEMANDS OF ONE PARTY AND THE ULTIMATE EXACTIONS OF THE OTHER MIGHT PERFECTLY WELL BE MET BY A RELINQUISHMENT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TERRITORIAL ACQUISITIONS SIR HENRY BULWERS COUNTER PROPOSITION TO THIS EFFECT PROVED ENTIRELY ACCEPTABLE TO MR CLAYTON AND ARTICLE I OF THE TREATY WAS ACCORDINGLY CAST IN THE FORM OF A SELFDENYING ACT WHEREBY THE TWO GOVERNMENTS PROMISED JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY NOT TO MAINTAIN EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER THE CANAL ROUTE AND NEVER IN THE FUTURE TO DISTURB THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES  HAVING SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED THE INITIAL DIFFICULTY THE PLENIPOTENTIARIES WERE FREE TO PROCEED TO THE FORMULATION OF THEIR PLANS FOR THE COOPERATIVE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CANAL AMERICAN CONCESSIONAIRES STILL HELD THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT OF WAY THROUGH NICARAGUA BUT FULLY REALIZING THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF RAISING THE CAPITAL REQUISITE FOR SO LARGE AN UNDERTAKING IN THE UNITED STATES THE PROMOTERS WERE WILLING ENOUGH TO  ARTICLE ITHE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN HEREBY DECLARE THAT NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER WILL EVER OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN FOR ITSELF ANY EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER THE SAID SHIPCANAL AGREEING THAT NEITHER WILL EVER ERECT OR MAINTAIN ANY FORTIFICATIONS COMMANDING THE SAME OR IN THE VICINITY THEREOF OR OCCUPY OR FORTIFY OR COLONIZE OR ASSUME OR EXERCISE ANY DOMINION OVER NICARAGUA COSTA RICA THE MOSQUITO COAST OR ANY PART OF CENTRAL AMERICA NOR WILL EITHER MAKE USE OF ANY PROTECTION WHICH EITHER AFFORDS OR MAY AFFORD OR ANY ALLIANCE WHICH EITHER HAS OR MAY HAVE TO OR WITH ANY STATE OR PEOPLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ERECTING OR MAINTAINING ANY SUCH FORTIFICATIONS OR OF OCCUPYING FORTI FYING OR COLONIZING NICARAGUA COSTA RICA THE MOSQUITO COAST OR ANY PART OF CENTRAL AMERICA OR OF ASSUMING OR EXERCISING DOMINION OVER THE SAME NOR WILL THE UNITED STATES OR GREAT BRITAIN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY INTIMACY OR USE ANY ALLIANCE CONNECTION OR INFLUENCE THAT EITHER MAY POSSESS WITH ANY STATE OR GOV ERNMENT THROUGH WHOSE TERRITORY THE SAID CANAL MAY PASS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING OR HOLDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FOR THE CITIZENS OR SUBJECTS OF THE ONE ANY RIGHTS OR ADVANTAGES IN REGARD TO COMMERCE OR NAVIGATION THROUGH THE SAID CANAL WHICH SHALL NOT BE OFFERED ON THE SAME TERMS TO THE CITIZENS OR SUBJECTS OF THE OTHER 296THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY ALLOW BRITISH INVESTORS TO SHARE IN THE PROFITS OF THE ENTER PRISE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE CITIZENS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES FORESHADOWED THE NECESSITY OF DUAL CONTROL AND BY THIS CLUE THE NEGOTIATORS WERE BROUGHT FROM THE NEGATIVE PROMISES OF THEIR SELFDENYING ACT TO THE POSITIVE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE VIII WHEREIN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS AGREED TO EXTEND THEIR JOINT PROTECTION TO THE INTEROCEANIC CANAL OF THE FUTURE NOTHING WAS SAID OF THE METHOD OF EXTENDING SUCH PROTECTION BUT AS NEITHER POWER WAS ALLOWED TO OCCUPY OR FORTIFY THE ROUTE THE PRESUMPTION WAS IN FAVOR OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF NAVAL FORCE FOR THE PURPOSE AND CON SIDERING THE RELATIVE SEAPOWER OF THE CONTRACTING PARTIES THE BRUNT OF THE BURDEN NOT TO SPEAK OF THE RESULTING ADVANTAGES WAS EVIDENTLY TO DEVOLVE UPON GREAT BRITAIN THE MUTUAL SACRIFICES REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO RECIPROCAL ADVANTAGE BUT IN REASONING THUS NO ALLOWANCE WAS MADE FOR THE RELATIVE STRATEGIC POSITION OF THE PARTNERS TO THE CON TRACT BY RENOUNCING HER CLAIM TO THE SHORE ENGLAND GAINED A CLEAR RIGHT OF WAY THROUGH AN UNDEFENDED COUNTRY WHICH SHE COULD EASILY DOMINATE WITH HER FLEET THE UNITED STATES ON THE OTHER HAND IN RETREATING FROM HER POSITION ALONG THE CANAL ROUTE PRACTICALLY LEFT HER SOUTHERN FRONTIER UNGUARDED AND THEREFORE AT THE MERCY OF HER MARITIME  ARTICLE VIIITHE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN HAVING NOT ONLY DESIRED IN ENTERING INTO THIS CONVENTION TO ACCOMPLISH A PARTICULAR OBJECT BUT ALSO TO ESTABLISH A GENERAL PRINCIPLE THEY HEREBY AGREE TO EXTEND THEIR PROTECTION BY TREATY STIPULATIONS TO ANLY OTHER PRACTICABLE COMMUNICATIONS WHETHER BY CANAL OR RAILWAY ACROSS THE ISTHMUS WHICH CONNECTS NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND ESPECIALLY TO THE INTEROCEANIC COMMUNICATIONS SHOULD THE SAME PROVE TO BE PRACTICABLE WHETHER BY CANAL OR RAILWAY WHICH ARE NOW PROPOSED TO BE ESTABLISHED BY THE WAY OF TEHUANTEPEC OR PANAMA IN GRANTING HOWEVER THEIR JOINT PROTECTION TO ANY SUCH CANALS OR RAILWAYS AS ARE BY THIS ARTICLE SPECIFIED IT IS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD BY THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN THAT THE PARTIES CONSTRUCTING OR OWNING THE SAME SHALL IMPOSE NO OTHER CHARGES OR CONDITIONS OF TRAFFIC THEREUPON THAN THE AFORESAID GOVERNMENTS SHALL APPROVE OF AS JUST AND EQUITABLE AND THAT THE SAME CANALS OR RAILWAYS BEING OPEN TO THE CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN ON EQUAL TERMS SHALL ALSO BE OPEN ON LIKE TERMS TO THE CITIZENS AND SUBJECTS OF EVERY OTHER STATE WHICH IS WILLING TO GRANT THERETO SUCH PROTECTION AS THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN ENGAGE TO AFFORD 297 I314 ANNALS OF THE AMBRICAN ACADEIY RIVAL IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOWEVER THAT BY REASON OF HER ISOLATED POSITION THE UNITED STATES HAD NOT AS YET EXPERIENCED THE NECESSITY OF SEABOARD DEFENCE AND IT IS DOUBTFUL THEREFORE WHETHER THE LOGIC OF GEOGRAPHY EVEN IF APPREHENDED WOULD HAVE CARRIED MUCH WEIGHT WITH THE AMERICAN MIND OF THE DAY AS IT WAS THE UNITED STATES FELT SATISFIED TO HAVE FREED CENTRAL AMERICA FROM FURTHER BRITISH ENCROACHMENT WITHOUT RELINQUISHING RIGHTS ALREADY ACQUIRED OR PRIVILEGES THUS FAR CLAIMED WITH THE AID OF ENGLISH CAPITAL SHE WAS FURTHERMORE TO HAVE HER SEABOARDS JOINED AND THE PURELY DOMESTIC PROBLEM OF ISTHMUS TRANSIT SATISFACTORILY SOLVEDAND ALL IN RETURN FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT EXCLUSIVE FAVORS OF DOUBTFUL VALUE ALONG THE ROUTE NOR HAD ENGLAND ANY CAUSE TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH THE ARRANGE MENT FOR SHE HAD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED IN TURNING HER ISTHMIAN ASSETS TO REMARKABLY GOOD ACCOUNT INSTEAD OF MERELY HOLDING THE KEY TO THE SITUATION SHE WAS NOW ASSURED OF FUTURE CONTROL OF THE WESTERLY ROUTE TO THE INDIES THUS JUDGED FROM THE RESTRICTED STANDPOINT OF THE DAY THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY MAY BE REGARDED AS A TRUE EXPRESSION OF THE THEN PREVAILING TENOR OF ANGLOAMERICAN OPINION ON THE TRANSIT QUESTION SO RESTRICTED HOWEVER WERE THE LINES OF JOINT ACTION BY THE LIMITATIONS OF TIME AND PLACE THAT THE ORIGINAL CON CURRENCE OF OPINION WAS NONE TOO FIRMLY FIXED BY THE TERMS OF THE CONVENTION TO FURTHER WEAKEN THE STRUCTURE SIR HENRY BULWER DELIBERATELY REMOVED THE KINGPOST FROM UNDER THE AMERICAN SIDE OF THE AGREEMENT BY DECLARING IN A PRIVATE NOTE TO MR CLAYTON DELIVERED JUST BEFORE THE RATIFICATION OF THE INSTRUMENT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ENGAGEMENTS OF THAT CONVENTION TO APPLY TO HER MAJESTYS SETTLEMENT AT HONDURAS OR ITS DEPENDENCIES  PUT MORE BLUNTLY THIS SIMPLY MEANT THAT THE WHOLE QUESTION OF BRITISH TERRITORIAL RIGHTS ON THE ISTHMUS ONE OF THE TWO ESSENTIALS OF THE CONTRACT TO THE 298THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY UNITED STATES WAS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE TREATY AND MADE TO DEPEND HENCEFORTH UPON AN EX PARTE INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD DEPENDENCY BUT MR CLAYTON WAS BY THIS TIME TOO BADLY BEWILDERED TO SEE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SITUATION BLUNDERING BLINDLY ALONG HE ACCEPTED THE DECLARATION AS A MATTER OF NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE AND FILED IT AWAY AMONG THE ARCHIVES OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT THE SENATE WAS THUS KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF THIS ALLIMPORTANT BRITISH RESERVATION AND RATIFIED THE TREATY UNDER THE NAIVE CONVICTION THAT CENTRAL AMERICA WAS FINALLY FREED FROM FOREIGN CONTROL IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT MOREOVER THAT THE SECOND ESSENTIAL OF THE CONTRACT THE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE CAPITALISTS OF THE TWO COUNTRIES WAS LIKEWISE TO FAIL FOR IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS THE AMERICAN PROMOTERS WERE UNABLE TO INTEREST BRITISH INVESTORS IN THE CANAL PROJECT ALL HOPE OF BEGINNING OPERATIONS UPON THE CANAL ITSELF HAD THEREWITH TO BE ABANDONED BUT IN ORDER TO REAP SOME PROFIT FROM THE INCREASING TIDE OF TRAFFIC TOWARD THE GOLDFIELDS AN OFFSHOOT OF THE ORIGINAL COMPANY DETERMINED AT ALL EVENTS TO OPEN A PROVISIONAL ROUTE OF TRANSIT BY STEAMER AND STAGE THROUGH NICARAGUA THE CROWD OF AMERICANS THUS ATTRACTED TO THE SCENE STRAIGHTWAY DEMONSTRATED THEIR INHERITED CAPACITY FOR SELFGOVERNMENT BY ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT TOWN AT THE PORT OF THE SAN JUAN LEST THE FREE CITY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED FROM WASHINGTON GREAT BRITAIN THEREUPON PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED HER RESERVED RIGHTS ALONG THE SHORE TO LEND PRACTICAL SUPPORT TO THE DECISION MARINES WERE THEN LANDED IN GREYTOWN AND THE MOSQUITO PROTECTORATE FORMALLY REVIVED SHORTLY AFTER THIS THE BAY ISLANDS WERE ALSO INCLUDED UNDER THE CLAIM AND CONSTITUTED A BRITISH COLONY SUCH WAS THE ENGLISH INTERPRETATION OF THE DEPENDENCIES OF BELIZE IN SPITE OF THE UNEXPECTED TURN OF EVENTS THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT STILL HOPED TO ADJUST THE MATTER AMICABLY ALONG THE LINES LAID DOWN IN THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY BUT AMERICAN CITIZENS WERE NO LONGER TO BE BOUND BY DIPLOMACY R2991 I5I6 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BY MIXING IN THE INTERNAL POLITICS OF NICARAGUA A BAND OF ADVENTURERS UNDER THE FAMOUS FILIBUSTER WALKER STRAIGHT WAY SUCCEEDED IN GAINING POSSESSION OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THEREBY SECURED CONTROL OF THE CANAL ROUTE WITH SOUTHERN FILIBUSTERS NOW PITTED AGAINST NORTHERN CONCESSIONAIRES AND DIPLOMATIC PROTESTS POURING IN FROM ABROAD THE WASHINGTON AUTHORITIES WERE COMPLETELY NONPLUSSED AND AFTER CON SIDERABLE VACILLATION ONLY INTERVENED IN THE END TO RESTORE THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT TO THE UNCERTAIN HANDS OF THE NATIVE NICARAGUANS THUS NEITHER THE POLITICAL NOR THE ECONOMIC PURPOSE WAS ACCOMPLISHED FOR WHICH THE UNITED STATES HAD ENTERED INTO NEGOTIATION BEING DENIED THEIR POTTAGE IT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH THEREFORE THAT AMERICANS SHOULD SEEK TO RECOVER THEIR BIRTHRIGHT AT THAT TIME INDEED THE GOVERNMENT HAD GROUNDS ENOUGH TO INSIST UPON THE IMMEDIATE ABROGA TION OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY TRUE BOTH PARTIES HAD VIOLATED ARTICLE I OF THE CONVENTION BY SUBSEQUENTLY INTER FERING IN CENTRAL AMERICAN AFFAIRS BUT WHILE THE UNITED STATES HAD FORMALLY DISAVOWED THE ACTS OF HER IRRESPONSIBLE FILIBUSTERS GREAT BRITAIN ON THE OTHER HAND HAD OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED THE AUTHORITY OF HER GOVERNMENTAL AGENTS THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE PARTNERS WAS THUS ALTERED CON SIDERABLY GREAT BRITAIN HAD FOR HER PART SUCCEEDED IN RE ESTABLISHING THE STATUS QUO ANTE CONVENTUM BUT THE UNITED STATES BY HER ACTION SIMPLY REVERTED TO THE STATUS QUO POST CONVENTUM EVEN ACCEPTING SIR HENRY BULWERS COVERT DECLARATION ONLY AT THIS JUNCTURE BROUGHT TO LIGHT AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE TREATY IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES TO DENY THE ENGLISH INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD DEPENDENCY AND REGARD THE RETENTION OF THE MOSQUITO PROTECTORATE AND THE OCCUPATION OF THE BAY ISLANDS AS VIOLATIONS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT FROM THE DEBATES IN CONGRESS IT SOON BECAME APPARENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS DISPOSED TO TAKE THIS VIEW OF THE MATTER THE BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE HAD ACCORD 300THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY INGLY TO PASS ONCE MORE UPON THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PRESENT POSSESSION OR FUTURE CONTROL AND THE DECISION WAS AGAIN IN FAVOR OF THE LATTER ALTERNATIVE AS A MATTER OF CHOICE THE PARTNERSHIP PROVISIONS OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY WERECERTAINLY TO BE PREFERRED TO THE DOUBTFUL PRO TECTORATE OF THE SHORE THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE HOWEVER BETWEEN BEING FORCED TO RETREAT AND IN VOLUNTARILY ABANDONING THE CLAIM IT WAS TO GREAT BRITAINS ADVANTAGE THEREFORE TO STAVE OFF AMERICAN ACTION UPON ABROGATION UNTIL SHE HERSELF COULD ESTABLISH THE STATUS QUO POST CONVENTUM BY DEALING DIRECTLY WITH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES SEPARATE TREATIES WERE ACCORDINGLY CONCLUDED WITH HONDURAS GUATEMALA AND NICARAGUA UNDER WHOSE TERMS GREAT BRITAIN ABANDONED THE BAY ISLANDS ACQUIRED DEFINITE RIGHTS IN BELIZE AND ONLY RETAINED SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY OVER THE FUTURE AFFAIRS OF MOSQUITOLAND BUT IN ORDER TO GRANT ONE MUST LEGALLY HOLD IN ALLOW ING THESE NEGOTIATIONS TO PROCEED WITHOUT PROTEST ON THEIR PART THE AMERICANS THEREFORE TACITLY ADMITTED THE VALIDITY OF THE VERY BRITISH CLAIMS THEY HAD UP TO THIS SO STRENUOUSLY DENIED HAVING PASSED THUS BY IMPLICATION UPON THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED ENGLISH TITLES TO THE SHORE THE UNITED STATES HAD NO FURTHER GROUNDS TO INSIST UPON THE ABROGATION OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATYPROVIDED OF COURSE THE QUITCLAIM DEEDS WERE FOUND TO BE IN PROPER FORM EVEN ON THIS MINOR POINT OBJECTIONS MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN RAISED TO THE INCOMPLETE TRANSFER OF THE MOSQUITO PROTECTORATE BUT HAVING ADMITTED THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE THE AMERICANS WERE NOT DISPOSED TO BE CAPTIOUS REGARDING DETAILS SO AFTER LOOKING OVER THE TREATIES PRESIDENT BUCHANAN ARTLESSLY PLACED A SECOND ESTOPPEL UPON THE AMERICAN SIDE OF THE CASE BY DECLARING IN HIS MESSAGE THAT THE DISCORDANT CONSTRUC TIONS OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERN MENTS    HAVE RESULTED IN A FINAL SETTLEMENT ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY TO THIS GOVERNMENT THUS THE CONVENTION CONTINUED TO PREVAIL AND BOTH PARTIES 30I I7IS ANNALS OF THZ AMERICAN ACADEMY WERE APPARENTLY CONTENT THERE WAS NO DISPOSITION ON EITHER SIDE HOWEVER TO DEVELOP THE SITUATION ANY FURTHER ALONG THE LINES LAID DOWN FROM A PRESENT POSSIBILITY THE CANAL PROJECT HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME A TRADITION OF THE PAST ASSURED OF FUTURE ASCENDANCY ALONG THE ROUTE GREAT BRITAIN TOOK NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE TRANSIT PROBLEM BEYOND PRESERVING HER RESERVED RIGHTS ON THE ISTHMUS AND UPON THE OUTBREAK OF THE CIVIL WAR THE ATTENTION OF THE UNITED STATES WAS LIKEWISE DIVERTED FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN AFFAIRS THE WHOLE QUESTION OF INTEROCEANIC COMMUNICATION WAS ACCORDINGLY PIGEONHOLED BY THE ANGLOSAXON POWERS FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION OPENED NEW ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PROSPECTS TO THE UNITED STATES AND ALTERED HER ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY BEFORE THE WAR EASTERN CAPITALISTS WERE THE ONLY PERSONS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE CANAL PROJECT BUT UNDER THE NEW ORDER OF THINGS A DEMAND FOR INTEROCEANIC COMMUNICATION AROSE AMONG THE GRAIN AND FRUITGROWERS OF THE NEW WEST AND THE PLANTERS AND MINERS OF THE RECONSTRUCTED SOUTH CUT OFF AS THEY WERE BY THE ISTHMUS FROM THEIR NATURAL MARKETS POLITICAL CONTINGENCIES HAD LIKEWISE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR THOUGH THE UNION HAD BEEN PRESERVED DISJOINTED COASTLINES AND THE LACK OF TRANSCONTINENTAL COMMUNICATION WERE EXTREMELY LIKELY TO LEAD TO A NEW SECTIONALISM ALONG LONGITUDINAL LINES THE FRENCH OCCUPATION OF MEXICO HAD ALSO TAUGHT THE UNITED STATES A SALUTARY LESSON IN THE MAT TER OF SEABOARD DEFENCE AND SUGGESTED THE ADVISABILITY OF IMPROVING THE SOUTHERN FRONTIER OF THE COUNTRY IN BEHALF OF NATIONAL PROSPERITY AND IN THE INTERESTS OF TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY THE GOVERNMENT THEREFORE FELT CALLED UPON AFTER PROVIDING FOR PACIFIC RAILWAYS TO TAKE DEFINITE INITIATIVE LIKEWISE IN THE MATTER OF ISTHMUS TRANSIT REPEATED OFFICIAL SURVEYS HAVING DEMONSTRATED BEYOND PERADVENTURE THE SUPERIORITY OF THE NICARAGUAN ROUTE IT 302THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY AGAIN BECAME INCUMBENT UPON THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE DIPLOMATIC PROVISION WITH THIS REPUBLIC FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CANAL AND THIS BROUGHT THE AUTHORITIES TO A FRESH QUANDARY TRUE NOTHING HAD AS YET OCCURRED TO DISTURB THE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF THE TRANSIT QUESTION WHICH THE AMERICANS HAD INHERITED FROM SPAIN AND THE UNITED STATES STILL CONTINUED TO REGARD THE CANAL PROJECT ACCORDINGLY IN THE LIGHT OF A LOCAL EXPEDIENT BUT THE PROGRESS OF EVENTS HAD AT LEAST DISCLOSED THE GEOGRAPHIC PREMISES OF THE ARGUMENT AND THE LOGIC OF THE SITUATION NOW LED TO NATIONAL CONTROL THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY STILL STOOD IN THE WAY OF ANY SUCH CONCLUSION HOWEVER AND IN DEALING DIPLOMAT ICALLY WITH NICARAGUA THE UNITED STATES HAD CONSEQUENTLY TO CONTENT HERSELF WITH SIMPLY GUARANTEEING THE NEUTRALITY OF THE ROUTE IN RETURN FOR THE DESIRED RIGHT OF TRANSIT IN THE MERE EXPRESSION OF OPINION MORE LATITUDE WAS HOWEVER ALLOWED AND TWO REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS GRANT AND HAYES FELT FREE TO DECLARE THE FUTURE POLICY OF THE COUNTRY TO BE A CANAL UNDER AMERICAN CONTROL THESE STATEMENTS WERE OF COURSE EX PARLE FOR WITHOUT ENGLANDS CONSENT THE UNITED STATES COULD ASSUME NO SUCH MONOPOLY PRIVILEGES IN THE HOPES OF MAKING THE CONVEN TION CONFORM WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE NEWLY ADOPTED POLICY SUCCESSIVE SECRETARIES OF STATE THEN ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE GREAT BRITAIN TO RECONSIDER THE AMERICAN CLAIM MR BLAINE OPENED THE THEORETICAL ARGUMENT BY A BELATED APPEAL TO THE JUDGMENT OF GEOGRAPHY TO THIS LORD GRANVILLE VERY PROPERLY REPLIED THAT IF PRESIDENT MONROE HAD BEEN ABLE IN 1823 TO FORECAST THE FUTURE RELATION OF HIS COUNTRY TO THE WESTERN CONTINENT THE NEGOTIATORS OF THE TREATY OF 1850 MUST SURELY HAVE POSSESSED SUFFICIENT PREVI SION TO PROVIDE FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED TO ALTER THE SITUATION MATERIALLY UPON THIS REFUSAL ON THE PART OF THE ENGLISH SECRETARY TO ADMIT THAT NEW CONDITIONS HAD RENDERED THE OLD CONVENTION NUGATORY MR BLAINE PROCEEDED TO RAISE 303 I920 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY CERTAIN HISTORICAL OBJECTIONS TO THE TREATY INSTANCING A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS UPON WHICH IN HIS OPINION GREAT BRITAIN HAD VIOLATED ITS TERMS HE CLOSED HIS RECITAL HOWEVER WITH THE YEAR I859 SO IN REPLY LORD GRANVILLE HAD ONLY TO RECALL PRESIDENT BUCHANANS EXPRESSION OF SATIS FACTION WITH THE SITUATION IN I860 TO PUT AN END TO THIS LINE OF ARGUMENT AS WELL UNDAUNTED BY HIS PREDECESSORS DE FEAT MR FRELINGHUYSEN CONTINUED THE HISTORICAL ATTACK BY CLAIMING THAT IN RAISING THE BELIZE SETTLEMENT TO THE RANK OF A CROWN COLONY ENGLAND HAD VIOLATED THE TREATY AFTER PRESIDENT BUCHANANS TERM IN ANSWER LORD GRANVILLE WAS ABLE TO SHOW THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD HERSELF ADMIT TED THE LEGAL EXISTENCE OF THE COLONY OF BRITISH HONDURAS IN THE POSTAL CONVENTION OF I869 AND WAS THEREFORE ESTOPPED FROM FURTHER OBJECTIONS ON THIS SCORE MR FRELINGHUYSEN THEN SHIFTED THE ARGUMENT SUDDENLY FROM HISTORY TO INTER PRETATION AND ENDEAVORED TO PROVE THAT THE COOPERATIVE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE VIII ONLY APPLIED TO THE CANAL PROJECTS PROPOSED IN THE PAST AND NOT TO FUTURE PLANS BUT AS NO PERIOD HAD BEEN SET IN THE CONTRACT LORD GRANVILLE JUSTLY DENIED THE APPLICABILITY OF ANY SUCH STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND CURTLY REFUSED TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION ANY FURTHER MR BLAINES ARGUMENTS WERE MERELY DIRECTED TO THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF AMERICAN CONTROL BUT MR FRELING HUYSEN HAD A PARTICULAR END IN VIEW ANTICIPATING SUCCESS IN THE DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN PRESIDENT ARTHUR HAD IN FACT ALREADY CONCLUDED AN ARRANGEMENT WITH NICARAGUA WHEREBY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WAS TO CONSTRUCT OWN AND CONTROL THE PROPOSED CANAL THE PLAN WAS HOWEVER CON TINGENT UPON THE MODIFICATION OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY AND AS THERE WAS SO LITTLE PROBABILITY OF ENGLANDS CONSENT ING TO THE CHANGE PRESIDENT CLEVELAND DID NOT FEEL INCLINED TO CONTINUE HIS PREDECESSORS POLICY IN WITHDRAWING THE CANAL CONVENTION FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION OSTENSIBLY UPON THESE GROUNDS THE EXECUTIVE GRANTED BY IMPLICATION THE CONTINUED VALIDITY OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY A 304THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY THIRD ESTOPPEL WAS THUS ADDED TO THOSE PREVIOUSLY PLACED UPON THE AMERICAN CASE BY CLAYTON AND BUCHANAN AND THE ATTACK UPON THE TERMS OF THE TREATY MUST ACCORDINGLY BE CONSIDERED AS RESULTING IN AMERICAN CAPITULATION PLEDGED TO PROCEED ALONG IMPOSSIBLE LINES CONTRADICTION CONTINUED FOR THE TIME TO CHARACTERIZE ANGLOAMERICAN RELATIONS AND THE COOPERATIVE TENOR OF THE CANAL CONVENTION ONLY ADDED IRONY TO THE IRRITATING CIRCUMSTANCES FORTU NATELY NO CONTROVERSY OVER THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF CONSTRUC TION AND CONTROL HAS UP TO THE PRESENT OCCURRED TO INCREASE THE ACERBITY OF THE SITUATION IN THE MEANTIME INTERNA TIONAL EVENTS ARE MAKING FOR A READJUSTMENT OF THE RELATIVE ATTITUDE OF THE PARTIES TOWARD THE GENERAL QUESTION OF INTER OCEANIC COMMUNICATION WHICH PROMISES A BETTER BASIS OF AGREEMENT SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY COM MERCIAL CIVILIZATION HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN EITHER DIRECTION ABOUT THE GLOBE EASTERN COMMERCE BEING FROM THE OUTSET CONDITIONAL UPON INTEROCEANIC COMMUNICATION IT WAS NATURAL THAT ADEQUATE MARITIME CONNECTIONS WITH THE PACIFIC SHOULD FIRST BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE SUEZ CANAL THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THIS ONESIDED AMELIORATION HAS BEEN TO ALLOW THE EASTERLY CURRENT OF COMMERCE TO SPREAD SOMEWHAT FURTHER OUT ACROSS THE PACIFIC THAN SHOULD NORMALLY BE THE CASE AND TO THROW BACK THE TIDE OF AMERICAN PROGRESS UPON ITS EUROPEAN SOURCES MODERN TRADE ROUTES STILL RADIATE ACCORDINGLY FROM THE INDUSTRIAL CENTRES OF EUROPE TO A PERIPHERY NOW BOUNDED ON THE EAST BY THE LITTORAL ISLANDS OF ASIA AND ON THE WEST BY THE PACIFIC SHORES OF AMERICA THIS ARRANGEMENT OF ROUTES ALLOWS EUROPEAN MANU FACTURERS TO DRAW THEIR SUPPLIES FROM ALL QUARTERS OF THE EARTH AND DISPOSE OF THEIR SURPLUS FINISHED PRODUCTS ON THE MARKETS OF ASIA AFRICA AND AMERICA UP TO THE PRESENT THEREFORE AMERICA LIKE THE OTHER NEW CONTINENTS HAS 305 2122 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY STOOD IN THE POSITION OF A PURVEYOR OF RAW PRODUCE TO THE MARKETS OF THE OLD WORLD SO LONG AS THE UNITED STATES REMAINED THE LEADING AGRICULTURAL COUNTRY THE SITUATION WAS SATISFACTORY ENOUGH BUT THE OPENING UP OF FRESH SOURCES OF COLONIAL SUPPLY HAS LOWERED THE PRICE OF RAW PRODUCE AND MADE IT MORE PROFITABLE FOR AMERICANS TO BECOME EXPORTERS OF FINISHED GOODS THE NATURAL MARKET FOR AMERICAN MANUFACTURES LIES ON THE PACIFIC SIDE OF THE GLOBE AND THE INDUSTRIALISTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE ALREADY EAGER TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THEIR EUROPEAN RIVALS FOR A SHARE IN THIS SOUTH SEA TRADE THE DIFFICULTY LIES IN THE LACK OF A WESTERLY SEA ROUTE TO THE PACIFIC THE ISTHMUS NOW STANDS SQUARELY IN THE WAY OF AMERICAS FURTHER COMMERCIAL EXPAN SION AND HINDERS THE NATURAL OUTFLOW OF HER EXPORT COM MODITIES UNWILLING TO BE THUS HANDICAPPED BY POOR MEANS OF COMMUNICATION THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE EAST HAVE RECENTLY JOINED THEIR PLEAS TO THE LONGSTANDING DEMANDS OF THE WEST AND SOUTH FOR A WATERWAY BETWEEN THE SEAS AND THE NATION IS AT LAST CONVINCED OF THE ECONOMIC NECESSITY OF THE CANAL BY ACCORDING THE COUNTRY ISLAND COLONIES ALL ACROSS THE PACIFIC THE WAR WITH SPAIN HAS ALSO ADDED COGENT POLITICAL ARGUMENTS FOR THE IMMEDIATE CONSTRUCTION OF AN INTEROCEANIC CANAL OVER AND ABOVE THE ACKNOWLEDGED EXPEDIENCY OF JOINING THE DISCONNECTED COAST LINES OF THE COUNTRY AND CON TROLLING THE SOUTHERN FRONTIER THUS ESTABLISHED THE FURTHER STRATEGIC NECESSITY HAS ARISEN BEFORE THE UNITED STATES OF EXERCISING ASCENDANCY ALONG THE SEA ROUTE LEADING TO HER WIDELY SEPARATED INSULAR POSSESSIONS ON THE WEST INTER OCEANIC COMMUNICATION IS IN SHORT NO LONGER A MERE QUESTION OF LOCAL AMELIORATION BUT A MATTER OF IMPERIAL IMPORTANCE UPON WHICH THE WHOLE POLICY OF EXPANSION DEPENDS THUS WITH THE ABANDONMENT OF THE OLDER ATTITUDE OF ISOLATION THE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF THE TRANSIT QUESTION IS FINALLY BEING CORRECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC FACTS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE COMING TO REALIZE AT LAST 306THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY THAT IT IS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF COMMERCIAL CIVILIZATION FOR THE DOMINANT POWER OF THE OCCIDENT TO CONTROL THE WESTERN GATEWAY TO THE PACIFIC UNTIL RECENTLY THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN UNABLE EXCEPT IN THE PHRASING OF THE MONROE DOCTRINE TO CLAIM ANY SUCH EXCLUSIVE PREROGATIVES IN THE NEW WORLD BUT THERE CAN SCARCELY BE ANY FURTHER QUESTION BETWEEN THE ANGLOAMERI CAN PARTNERS AS TO THE RIGHT OF PRECEDENCE ALONG THE WESTERLY COURSE OF PROGRESS BECAUSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE ALREADY CONFERRED THE LEADERSHIP UPON THE JUNIOR NATION THE COMMERCIAL ELEMENT IS HENCEFORTH BOUND TO PREVAIL IN AMERICA AND THE BRITISH PORTION OF THE NEW WORLD IS STILL PRIMARILY AGRICULTURAL NOR WILL IT BE POSSIBLE AFTER THE CANAL IS CONSTRUCTED FOR ENGLAND TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THE UNITED STATES ALONG THE WESTERLY COURSE OF COMMERCE FOR THE HANDICAP OF DISTANCETO SAY NOTHING OF RELATIVE RESOURCESMUST INEVITABLY TURN THE TABLES AGAINST THE MOTHER COUNTRY THOUGH EVIDENTLY COGNIZANT OF THE SITUATION THE BRITISH DO NOT APPEAR TO BE PARTICULARLY CHAGRINED AT THE ECONOMIC PROSPECT THEIR GRACEFUL ADMISSION OF THE VENEZUELAN CLAIM THEIR GENEROUS APPROVAL OF THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR WITH SPAIN AND THEIR CORDIAL WELCOME TO THE AMERICAN FLEET IN THE PHILIPPINES MAY PERHAPS WITHOUT IMPROPRIETY BE TAKEN AS EXPRESSIONS OF THEIR APPRECIATION OF THE ATTITUDE ASSUMED BY THE UNITED STATES TOWARD THE FURTHER PROGRESS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION IF THIS BE TRUE THE UNDERLYING CONTRADICTION OF NEWWORLD CLAIMS MAY AT LAST BE SAID TO HAVE DISAPPEARED AND OPPOR TUNITY IS CONSEQUENTLY AFFORDED OF REESTABLISHING ANGLO AMERICAN RELATIONS ALONG COOPERATIVE LINES ON THE OTHER HAND WHILE DISCLAIMING ALL INTENTION TO TAKE SIDES IN EURO PEAN CONTROVERSIES THE AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS EVINCED A LIVELY SENSE OF SATISFACTION AT THE SUCCESS OF ENGLISH ENTER PRISE IN THE EAST THEY ADMIRE THE BRITISH COLONIAL SYSTEM THEY APPROVE OF THE POLICY OF THE OPENDOOR AND THEY WATCH WITH SYMPATHETIC INTEREST ENGLANDS ADVANCE FROM 307 2324 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EGYPT THROUGH THE SOUDAN BRITISH ASCENDANCY ALONG THE EASTERLY LINE OF PROGRESS MEETS IN SHORT WITH THE HEARTY APPROBATION OF THE REPUBLICANS OF THE WEST DESTINY APPEARS ACCORDINGLY TO BE DRAWING A NEW LINE OF DEMARCATION ABOUT THE GLOBETHIS TIME BETWEEN THE ANGLOSAXON PEOPLES NOT SANCTIONED IT IS TRUE BY A PAPAL BULL AS WAS THE EARLIER DIVISION BETWEEN THE IBERIAN POWERS OF OLD BUT NONE THE LESS TO BE RESPECTED WITHAL THERE IS CONSEQUENTLY OCCASION FOR ANOTHER TREATY OF TORDESILLAS TO DEFINE THE SITUATION MORE PRECISELY AND PARADOXICAL THOUGH IT APPEAR BY SEPARATING THEIR RESPECTIVE SPHERES THE ANGLOAMERICAN POWERS WILL BE BROUGHT INTO STILL CLOSER ACCORD ENGLAND HAS A WELLCONSIDERED POLICY TO PURSUE ALONG THE EASTERLY LINE OF ADVANCE AND IN THE FACE OF EURO PEAN RIVALS SHE WILL PROBABLY BE GLAD OF AMERICAN SUPPORT THE UNITED STATES ON THE OTHER HAND IS JUST ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HER COLONIAL CAREER AND READY TO PROFIT BY THE EXAMPLE OF HER MORE EXPERIENCED PARTNER WITH THE LIMITS OF INFLUENCE PROPERLY DEFINED BY THE NEW LINE OF DEMARCATION COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ANGLOSAXON PEOPLES IS ACCORD INGLY POSSIBLE WITHOUT IN ANY WAY PREJUDICING THEIR FUTURE IMPERIAL PLANS THE DIPLOMATIC ANTECEDENTS ARE IN SHORT VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT PREVIOUSLY LED TO THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY MAY IT NOT BE POSSIBLE THEREFORE TO PRESERVE THE SPIRIT OF THE EXISTING ENGAGEMENT BY ADAPTING ITS FORM TO THE NEW CONDITIONS THE NEGOTIATORS OF THIS WELLINTENDING CON VENTION COULD SCARCELY BE EXPECTED TO HAVE POSSESSED SUFFI CIENT PREVISION TO PROVIDE FOR THE WORLDWIDE CIRCUMSTANCES OF TODAY THE TERMS OF THE TREATY ARE CONSEQUENTLY TOO NARROW AS THEY ONLY APPLY TO THE WEST BUT BY EXTENDING THE COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE TO INCLUDE BOTH COURSES OF COM MERCE THE TENOR OF THE INSTRUMENT MAY STILL BE RETAINED WITH THE ASSURANCE OF AMERICAN SUPPORT ENGLAND WOULD IN THIS CASE CONTINUE TO CONTROL THE SUEZ CANAL AND DOM INATE THE EASTERLY WATERROUTE TO THE INDIES WHILE THE 308THE CLAYTONBULWER TREATY 25 UNITED STATES ON THE OTHER HAND IN OBEDIENCE TO THE BEHESTS OF HER MONROE DOCTRINE WOULD REASSUME THE LEADERSHIP OF NEW WORLD CIVILIZATION AND GUARD THE NEU

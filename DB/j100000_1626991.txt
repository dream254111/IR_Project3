intervals from Octo ber to May the program being readily disposed of in a single afternoon session A summer meeting occupying two days was also held usually in connection with that of the American Association At the Buf falo meeting in 1896 and the Boston meet ing in 1898 a colloquium or course of lectures on recent developments in mathe matics was also provided With the growth of the Society in maturity and productive ness it was found advisable about two years ago to modify this plan so far as con cerned the winter meetings In order to make the individual meetings more promi nent and to secure them a concentration of interest it was decided that they should be held at intervals of two months viz on the last Saturday of October February and April and on a variable day in the last week of December In compensation for the reduction in the number of meetings provision was made for two sessions at each meeting to be held in the morning and af ternoon About the same time the Chicago Section was organized and its April and December meetings have proved valuable additions to the Societys activities The results have fully justified the wisdom of the new departure The attendance has greatly increased the number of papers presented at eacb meeting has quadrupled and the meetings have become more substantial and active centers of mathematical intercourse This remarkable advance is in one way oc casioning the Society a delectable embar rassment The number of papers offered for presentation is becoming so great that the two sessions of the meetings no longer fur nish anything like adequate time for their reading and discussion It will apparently soon be necessary to provide longer or more frequent meetings against both of which suggestions valid objections can be urged Another consequence of this profusion of mathematical riches is the growing inade quacy of the present facilities for publica tion of original mathematical articles in the country The Bulletin of the Society was established as a journal of critical and his torical investigation and although by the publication of a great number of shorter original articles it has widely departed from its original purpose it is no longer able to keep pace with the steadily in creasing output without sacrificing its proper functions a course which cannot be permitted The Council of the Society has therefore had for some time under con sideration the question of providing better facilities for publication and is at present seriously contemplating the periodical pub lication of Transactions of the Society This is a project very near to the hearts of many influential and productive mem bers of the Society and the enthusiasm which it has aroused has again contributed to stimulate the energies of the Society and affords gratifying evidence that the un dertaking will be successfully carried through A regular meeting of the Society was held at Columbia University on Saturday Febru ary 25th The total attendance at the two sessions was fortyseven including thirty nine members of the Society President R S Woodward who has succeeded Presi dent Simon Newcomb occupied the chair The Council announced the election of the following persons to membership in the So ciety Mr John B Faught Bloomington Ind Professor Edward B Fishburne Waynesboro Va Professor William P Graham Syracuse N Y Dr Waldemar

University of Chicago on Saturday April 1st F N COLE Secretary THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE HYOID IN BIRDS THE hyoid apparatus of birds is so sim ple a structure one so long known and so well studied that it would naturally be sup posed anatomists might agree upon the names of its component parts Those who have occasion to refer to anatomical textbooks however are well aware that there is a surprising not to say bewilder ing variation in the nomenclature used by different authors as a glance at the accom panying figure and table of names will make apparent It is quite evident that all of these names cannot be correct and a little reflection will show some of the changes that are certainly needed and others that probably should be made Taking the last first let us con sider that part B termed urohyal by Mivart and Gadow The urohyal of fishes is a membrane bone developed beneath the anterior portion of the branchial arches hence it is quite evident that the name cannot be consistently applied to a carti lage bone at the posterior end of the branchial apparatus and that Parkers term second basibranchial should stand Equally simple is the case of the paired bones D called basibranchials by Gadow and hypobranchials by Beddard Basi branchials are unpaired bones developed in the median line and the term is inapplica ble to paired bones lying on either side of an unpaired basal bone As for hypo branchials these are among the first seg MARCH 3 1899

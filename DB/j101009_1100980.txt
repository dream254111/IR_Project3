J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1100980,THE POWERS OF THE APPROACHING CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN VIRGINIA,I245884,100 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JUNE THE POWERS OF THE APPROACHING CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN VIRGINIA IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUEST OF THE EDITOR OF THE REGISTER THAT I SUPPLEMENT MY ARTICLE ON THE POWERS OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS IN GENERAL BY A FURTHER PAPER ON THE POWERS OF OUR APPROACHING CON STITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN PARTICULAR AS REGARDS THE ENACTMENT OF A NEW CONSTITUTION WITHOUT FIRST SUBMITTING IT TO THE PEOPLE FOR RATIFICATION I BEG TO SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING ASSUMING IT TO BE TRUE THAT THE CONVENTION IS NOT SOVEREIGN AND CAN NOT ENACT A CONSTITUTION UNLESS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED SO TO DO BY THE PEOPLE THE QUESTION NATURALLY ARISES WHERE SHALL WE LOOK FOR THAT AUTHORITY THE LEGISLATURE HAS ACTED ONLY TWICE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONVENTION VIZ FIRST BY THE ACT OF MARCH 5 1900 SUBMIT TING TO THE PEOPLE THE QUESTION OF CALLING THE CONVENTION AND SECOND BY THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 16 1901 PROVIDING FOR THE ELECTION OF DELE GATES TO THE CONVENTION AND FOR THE TIME AND PLACE OF ITS SITTING ETC TO WHICH OF THESE TWO ACTS MUST WE LOOK TO ASCERTAIN THE LIMITS OF THE CONVENTIONS POWERS THERE IS MUCH RESPECTABLE AUTHORITY TO SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 1901 IS THE ONE WHICH FIXES AND LIMITS THE POWERS OF THE CONVENTION BUT THIS THE WRITER SUBMITS IS A PALPABLE AND DEMONSTRABLE ERROR ALMOST AS DANGEROUS IN ITS POTENTIALITIES AS THE HERESY OF CONVENTION SOVEREIGNTY IF WE EXCEPT THE FIRST AMERICAN STATE LEGISLATURES WHICH RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO  REVOLUTIONARY CONVENITIONS  IT HAS NEVER BEEN CON TENDED IN THIS COUNTRY BY ANY ONE THAT A LEGISLATURE EXCEPT IN A PARTICULAR MANNER EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY THE CONSTITUTIONS OF SOME STATES HAS ANY POWER TO CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW NO ONE CLAIMS THIS POWER EXCEPT FOR THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES OR FOR THE CON VENTION AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE NOW IF THE COINVENTION BE SOVEREIGN AS SOME INSIST SO THAT EVEN THE PEOPLE CANNOT LIMIT ITS POWERS THEY BEING REDUCED TO THE ALTERNATIVE OF EITHER HAVING NO CONVENTION AT ALL OR ELSE HAVING ONE VESTED WITH UNCONTROLLABLE SOVEREIGNTY THEN SURELY IS THE LEGISLATURE POWERLESS TO PRESCRIBE OR LIMIT THE POWERS OR FUNCTIONS OF THIS SOVEREIGN BODY ON THE OTHER HAND IF IT BE TRUE AS THE WRITER ENDEAVORED TO SHOW IN HIS FIRST ARTICLE ABOVE REFERRED TO THAT1901 POWERS OF APPROACHING CONVENTION 101 THE PEOPLE ALONE HAVE THE POWER OF ENACTING OR CHANGING THE FUNDA MENTAL LAW THAT FROM THEM ALONE DOES THE CONVENTION DERIVE ITS POWERS IN THAT REGARD AND THAT THEY CAN CONFER JUST SO MUCH OR SO LITTLE OF THOSE POWERS UPON THE CONVENTION AS THEY PLEASETHEN IT NECESSARILY FOLLOWS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS NOT  THE PEOPLE CANNOT PRESCRIBE THE CONVENTIONS POWERS IT SEEMS ABSURD TO CONCEIVE OF POWERS BEING CONFERRED BY ONE BODY AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THOSE POWERS BEING FIXED BY ANOTHER BODY SURELY THE RIGHT TO CONFER POWER NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH IT THE RIGHT TO LIMIT THE POWER CONFERRED IF IT MAY BE LIMITED AT ALL AND A FORTIORI THE RIGHT TO PRESCRIBE THE LIMITATIONS OF POWERS IMPLIES THE RIGHT TO GRANT THEM IF WE CONCEDE TO THE LEGISLATURE THE RIGHT TO PRESCRIBE LIMITS FOR THE POWERS OF THE CONVENTION WE MUST ALSO CONCEDE TO IT THE RIGHT TO GRANT THESE POWERS WHICH NO ONE CLAIMS FOR HOW COULD THE LEGISLATURE GRANT POWERS THAT IT DID NOT POSSESS  IF THE POWERS MAY BE LIMITED AT ALL IT MUST BE BY THE AUTHORITY FROM WHENCE THE POWERS SPRUNG IT SEEMS CLEAR THEREFORE THAT IF ANY BODY CAN LIMIT THE POWERS OF THE CONVENTION THAT BODY MUST BE THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES FROM WHOM ALONE THE POWERS OF THE CONVENTION EMANATED NOW OF WHAT USE WOULD BE THIS POWER OF THE PEOPLE TO LIMIT THE AUTHORITY OF ITS AGENT THE CONVENTION IF ANOTHER AGENT THE LEGISLATURE COULD WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE PEOPLE ALTER SUCH LIMITATIONS IF THE LEGISLATURE MAY RESTRICT IT MAY ALSO ENLARGE THE POWERS OF THE CONVENTION IT IS MOST REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THE EXTENT OF THE POWERS OF A PROPOSED CONVENTION IS A CONTROLLING ELEMENT IN FIXING THE DECISION OF THE PEOPLE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO CALL SUCH A CONVEN TION INTO BEING MANY A MAN MIGHT VOTE TO CALL A CONVENTION TO PRPOWS WHO WOU1D NOT VOTE FOR ONE TO ENCWT A NEW CONSTIRXTION BUT IF THE LEGISLTTTURE MAY AFTERWVARDS PRE3WRILE OR ALTER THE POWERS OF SUCH CONVENTION A GROSS FRAUD COULD BE THUS PERPETRATED UPON THE PEOPLE BY FIRST INDUCING THEM TO CALL A CONVENTION TO PROPOSE AND AFTER IT HAS BEEN SO CALLED THEN AUTHORIZING IT TO ENACT A CONSTITUTION THIS WAS IN EFFECT DONE IN 1829 IN THIS STATE AGAINST THE PROTESTS AND UNANSWERABLE ARGUMENTS OF SOME OF ITS LEADING STATESMEN ON THAT OCCASION THE REAL WILL OF THE PEOPLE WAS DOUBTLESS CARRIED OUT SUBSTANTIALLY BUT THE METHOD ADOPTED WAS A MOST DANGEROUS PRECE DENT AND ONE WHICH IF RECOGNIZED MAY BE REPEATED TO THWART RATHER THAN TO CARRY OUT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLEIT WAS BUT ANOTHER IN STANCE OF  HARD CASES MAKING BAD LAW SUPPOSE THE QUESTION SHOULD BE SUBMITTED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO THE102 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JUNE PEOPLE  SHALL A CONVENTION BE CALLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROPOSING A NEW CONSTITUTION TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE PEOPLE FOR RATIFICATION OR RE JECTION   SUPPOSE THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE FAVORABLY UPON THE PROPOSITION AND SUCH CONVENTION BE ACCORDINGLY ORDERED AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD THEN ENACT THAT SUCH CONVENTION BE AUTHORIZED TO ADOPT A CONSTITUTION WITHOUT SUBMITTING IT TO THE PEOPLE WHAT IN SUCH A CASE WOULD BE SAID BY THE ADVOCATES OF THE RIGHT OF THE LEGIS LATURE TO PRESCRIBE THE POWERS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION  IT SEEMS CLEAR THEREFORE THAT UNLESS WE CONCEDE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE LEGISLATURE IN REFERENCE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW WE MUST DENY TO IT THE RIGHT TO PRESCRIBE THE POWERS OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS IF THIS CONCLUSION BE SOUND IT FOLLOWS THAT IN ASCERTAINING THE POWERS OF THE CONVENTION WE CANNOT LOOK TO THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 1901 PASSED AFTER THE CONVENTION HAD BEEN ORDERED BY THE PEOPLE AND THAT THE LIMITATIONS UPON THE CONVENTION SOUGHT TO BE IMPOSED BY THAT ACT WHICH WAS NEVER SUBMITTED TO NOR RATIFIED BY THE PEOPLE ARE OF NO BINDING FORCE THIS CRITICISM MUST OF COURSE BE UNDERSTOOD AS APPLICABLE ONLY TO SUCH PARTS OF THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 1901 AS UNDERTAKE TO PRESCRIBE OR LIMIT THE POWERS OF THE CONVENTION IN THE MATTER OF CHANGING THE CONSTITUTIONIN THE MERE MATTER OF PRESCRIBING THE SIZE OF THE CON VENTION THE ELECTION OF ITS MEMBERS THE TIME AND PLACE OF ITS ASSEM BLING AND THE DETAILS INCIDENT TO ITS PROCEEDINGS ETC THE LEGISLATURE DOUBTLESS HAS FULL AUTHORITV WHERE THEN IT MAY BE ASKED MUST WE LOOK FOR THE REAL LIMITATIONS OF THE CONVENTIONS POWERS IF NOT TO THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 1901  THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS TO THE ACT OF MARCH 5 1900 UNDER WHICH THE CONVENTION WAS ORDERED TO BE CALLED BUT IT WILL BE OBJECTED THIS IS ALSO AN ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND CAN THEREFORE HAVE NO MORE FORCE THAN THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 1901 WHICH BEING SUBSEQUENT IS REALLY CONTROLLING IT WILL BE SEEN HOWEVER THAT THE ACT OF MARCH 1900 SO FAR AS THE LEGISLATURE WAS CONCERNED SETTLED NOTHING IT WAS A MERE PROPOSITION WHICH ACQUIRED BINDING FORCE ONLY BY ITS ACCEPT ANCE BY THE PEOPLE WVHO ALONE MAY BE SAID TO HAVE ENACTED IT THE MERE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE HOWEVER GREAT HAVE NO RIGHT TO ENFORCE THEIR WILL UPON THE MINORITY SAVE WHEN THAT WILL IS EXPRESSED 1 THIS QUESTION WAS ELABORATELY DISCUSSED AND THE SAME CONCLUSION REACHED BY THE GREAT MASSACHUSETTS CONVENTION OF 1853 SEE DEBATES MASS CON 1853 VOL I PP 73 ET SEQ TO THE SAME EFFECT SEE THE OPINION OF THE JUSTICES OF N Y SUP CT CITED AND QUOTED IN DEBATES MASS CON VOL I P 1381901 POWERS OF APPROACHING CONVENTION 103 IN A LAWFUL MANNERA PROPOSITION NOW GENERALLY CONCEDED THE ONLY WAY IN THIS STATE BY WHICH SUCH WILL CAN BE EXPRESSED IN REGARD TO A PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE CONSTITUTION IS BY VOTING IN THE MANNER PRE SCRIBED BY LAW UPON A PROPOSITION WHICH HAS BEEN FIRST SUBMITTED TO THE PEOPLE BY THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THIS EXTENT BY POSSESSING THE SOLE POWER OF INITIATIVE THE LEGISLATURE MAY BE SAID TO BE ABLE TO PRE SCRIBE AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION AND THE POWERS OF CONSTITU TIONAL CONVENTIONS BUT TO NO GREATER EXTENT IS IT TRUE THE PEOPLE BY THE VERY UNWIELDINESS OF THEIR NUMBERS ARE INCAPA BLE AS A PHYSICAL FACT OF DOING MORE THAN MERELY VOTING  YES OR I NO  ON A PROPOSITION THAT HAS BEEN FIRST SUBMITTED TO THEM BY SOME ONE IT MANIFESTLY WOULD NOT DO TO PERMIT ANY PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL OR BODY OF PERSONS NOT AUTHORIZED BY THE LAW TO SUBMIT SUCH PROPOSITIONS TO THE PEOPLE AT THEIR PLEASURE AND FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THE LEGISLA TURE HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED BY LAW AS THE ONLY LAWFUL BODY AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT QUESTIONS TO THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION 2 SUCH POWERS SO FAR AS THEY RELATE TO FUNDAMENTAL LAW BEING IN THE FORM OF EITHER A SPECIFIC AMENDMENT OR A PROPOSITION FOR CALLING A CONVEN TION TO ADOPT OR PROPOSE A NEW CONSTITUTION THE FUNCTION OF THE LEGISLATURE IN EITHER CASE IS THE SAME VIZ THAT OF THE PRESIDING OFFICER OF A VAST ASSEMBLY COMPOSED OF THE PEOPLE WHO MERELY PUTS THE QUESTION TO THEM FOR THEIR VOTE AND DECISION EXCEPT ONLY THAT IT MAY BE SAID PURSUING THE COMPARISON THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ORIGI NATES AND DRAFTS THE MOTION AS WELL AS PUTS THE QUESTION AND TAKES THE VOTE DECLARING THE RESULT JUST AS NEITHER THE AUTHOR OF A MOTION NOR THE PRESIDING OFFICER WHO PUTS IT TO THE HOUSE AND DECLARES THE RE SULT NOR BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER ARE THE SOURCE FROM WHICH IT RECEIVES ITS FORCE AND EFFECT SO THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT BE REGARDED AS THE SOURCE OR AUTHORITY FOR THE CALLING OF THIS CONVENTION WHICH CALL THE LEGIS LATURE MERELY SUBMITTED TO THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN NO MORE BE SAID TO HAVE ENACTED ANY OF THE TERMS OR PROVISIONS OF THAT CALL THAN IT MAY BE SAID TO HAVE ENACTED A CONSTITUTIONAL AINENDMENT WHICH IT HAS MERELY PREPARED AND SUBMITTED TO THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR ADOPTION IT IS THE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE ALONE WHO ENACTED THE CALL FOR THIS CONVENTION BY ADOPTING THE PROPOSITION SUBMITTED TO THEM BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1900 JUST AS IT IS THE VOTING ASSEMBLY WHICH ADOPTS A MOTION AND NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE MOTION OR THE PRESIDING OFFICER WHO WELLS V BAIN 75 PA ST REP 75 2 SEE ACCOUNT OF  DORRS REBELLION  IN LUTHER V BORDEN 7 HOW U S REP

MOTION AS STATED BY THE PRESIDING OFFICER IN PUTTING THE QUESTION TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THE REAL ACTION OF THE ASSEMBLY WAS AND IN THE OTHER CASE WE HAVE IN LIKE MANNER TO LOOK TO THE CALL AS FRAMED AND SUBMITTED TO THE PEOPLE BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1900 IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT CALL THE PEOPLE REALLY MADE WHEN THE MOTION IS ADOPTED IN THE FIRST CASE IT BECOMES THE RESOLUTION OF THE ASSEMBLY FROM WHICH ALONE IT DERIVES ITS VALIDITY AND WHEN THE CALL FOR THE CONVENTION WAS ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLE IN 1900 IT BECAME THE ACT OF THE PEOPLE AND NOT OF THE LEGISLATURE WHICH MERELY FRAMED AND PRO POSED IT IT IS ONLY BY THIS CALL THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE EVER SPOKEN AS TO THE POWERS OF THE CONVENTION AND AS THOSE POWERS CAN BE PRESCRIBED BY THE PEOPLE ONLY IT FOLLOWS THAT IT IS THE ACT OF MARCH 5 1900 AS THE ACT OF THE PEOPLE AND NOT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO WHICH ALONE WE MUST LOOK FOR THE LIMITATION OF THOSE POWERS1 THAT ACT SPECIFIES THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE CONVENTION WAS CALLED TO BE  TO REVISE THE CONSTITUTION AND AMEND THE SAME THUS FOLLOW ING THE FORM PRESCRIBED IN THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION EXACTLY WHAT MEANING SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THIS LANGUAGE IS A QUESTION OF NO LITTLE DIFFI CULTY ON THE ONE HAND IT MAY BE CONTENDED THAT THE LANGUAGE SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS MERELY INDICATIVE OF THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE QONVENTION IS CALLED AND NOT AS DEFINING ITS POWERSJUST AS WE MIGHT SPEAK OF A COMMISSION  TO REVISE AND AMEND THE CODE  WITHOUT IM PLYING AN AUTHORITY TO ENACT THE AMENDMENTS AND THE FACT THAT OUR PRESENT CONATITUTION SEEMS TO PERMIT THE USE OF NO OTHER LANGUAGE WOULD SEEM TO LEND ADDITIONAL WEIGHT TO THIS CONTENTION ON THE OTHER HAND IT MAY BE INSISTED THAT NO LOOSE USE OF LANGUAGE SHOULDI BE IINPUUED TO THE DRAUGHTSMAN OF SO IMPORTANT AN INSTRUMENT THAT THE VERB AMEND EX VI TERMINI IMPORTS THE IDEA OF ENACTING AND NOT MERELY SUGGESTING THE AMENDMENT AND THAT THE PEOPLE COULD NOT HAVE AUTHORIZED THE CONVENTION IN MORE EXPRESS TERMS TO ENACT THE AMEND MENTS THAN BY GIVING THEM THE POWER TO  AMEND  THE CONSTITUTION MANY AND STRONG ARGUMENTS AND SOME AUTHORITIES MAY BE ADDUCED IN SUPPORT OF EACH OF THESE TWO VIEWS WHICH SPACE WILL NOT PERMIT TO BE SET OUT HERE IT IS A MNOST IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH WILL DOUBTLESS BE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH AND WITH THOROUGHNESS IN THE CONVENTION TO WHICH THEREFORE IT IS REFERRED I OPINION OF THE JUSTICES 6 CUSH MASS 5721901 POWERS OF APPROACHING CONVENTION 105 IN CASE IT SHOULD BE CONCLUDED THAT THE TERMS OF THE ACT OF MARCH 5 1900 DO NOT PERMIT THE ENACTING OF A CONSTITUTION BY THE CONVENTION A QUESTION MAY ARISE AS TO WHETHER IT SHOULD BE SUBMITTED FOR ADOPTION TO THE VOTERS QUALIFIED UNDER THE OLD OR UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION IF WE ONCE CONCEDE THAT THE CONVENTION IS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT THE AMEND MENTS TO THE PEOPLE IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW ANY REAL DOUBT COULD EXIST AS TO WHO THE PEOPLE ARE TO WHOM THE SUBMISSION MUST BE MADE THE AUTHORITIES AND WE SUBMIT REASON LIKEWISE HOLD THAT THE VOTERS QUALIFIED UNDER THE OLD AND THEREFORE EXISTING CONSTITUTION ARE THE VOTERS TO WHOM ALONE THE SUBMISSION MUST BE MADE IF WE ATTEMPT TO AP PLY THE SUFFRAGE QUALIFICATION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION BEFORE IT IS ADOPTED WILL IT NOT MANIFESTLY BE AN ADOPTION OF THAT INSTRUMENT PRO TANTO BY THE CONVENTION WITHOUT SUBMITTING IT TO THE PEOPLE AND IF THE CONVENTION MAY WITHOUT SUBMITTING IT ADOPT THE NEW CONSTITUTION IN PART WHY NOT IN TOTO EVEN THE CONVENTION OF 1829 WHICH WENT TO THE EXTREME LENGTH IN THIS RESPECT ADMITTED THE VALIDITY OF THIS ARGU MENT BUT SOUGHT TO JUSTIFY ITS ACTION IN ALLOWING THOSE NEWLY QUALI FIED BY THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION TO VOTE ON ITS ADOPTION BY RELYING UPON THE ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE UNDER WHICH THE DELEGATES TO THE CON VENTION WERE ELECTED AND WHICH EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED THE NEW CONSTI TUTION TO BE VOTED UPON BY THOSE QUALIFIED UNDER ITS TERMSTHUS IN EFFECT AUTHORIZING THE CONVENTION TO ENACT WITHOUT SUBMITTING IT THAT PORTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION EMBODYING THE FRANCHISE CLAUSE THEREOF BUT HOWEVER SOUND OR UNSOUND THAT CONTENTION MNAY HAVE BEEN IN THE CONVENTION OF 1829 THERE CAN BE NO GROUND WHATEVER TO SUPPORT IT IN THE CONVENTION OF 1901 AS ABOVE POINTED OUT THE ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE UNDER WHICH THE DELEGATES WERE ELECTED HAVING BEEN PASSED SUBSEQUENT TO THE CALL FOR THE CONVENTION AND NEVER HAVING BEEN PASSED UPON BY THE PEOPLE CANNOT PRESCRIBE THE POWERS OF THE CONVENTION IN THE MATTER OF ADOPTING A NEW CONSTITUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART AND AS WAS FORCIBLY POINTED OUT BY MR RANDOLPH AND OTHERS IN THE CONVENTION OF 1829 THE MERE ELECTION OF DELEGATES UNDER SUCH AN ACT CANNOT BE REGARDED AS A RATIFICATION OF THE ACT BY THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE PRESENTED TO THEM BUT EVEN IF WE ADMIT SUCH POWER IN THE LEGISLATURE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN THIS CASE THE ACT UNDER WHICH THE DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION OF 1901 WERE ELECTED SO FAR FROM AUTHORIZING THEM TO ENACT ANY PART OF 1 COOLEY ON CONST LIM P 30 1 STORY ONL CONST SEC 581 DEBATES VA

THEREFORE THAT THE CONVENTION OF 1901 HAS NOT EVEN THE EXCUSE THAT THE CONVENTION OF 1829 HAD FOR SUBMITTING THE NEW CONSTITUTION ONLY TO THE VOTERS QUALIFIED UNDER ITS PROVISIONSASSUMING OF COURSE THAT THE ACT OF MARCH 5 1900 WHICH ALONE AS ABOVE POINTED OUT MUST BE LOOKED TO FOR THE EXTENT AND LIMITATION OF THE CONVENTIONS POWERS SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS REQUIRING THE CONVENTION TO SUBMIT ITS WORK TO THE PEOPLE AT ALL THE CONVENTION OF 1901 HAS NO POWER OF ENACTING THE SUFFRAGE CLAUSE OF THE PROPOSED NEW CONSTITUTION UNLESS IT IS AUTHORIZED TO ENACT THE ENTIRE CONSTITUTION AND IF THE ACT OF MARCH 1900 DOES NOT AUTHOR IZE THE CONVENTION TO ENACT THE NEW CONSTITUTION IN TOTO THAT INSTRU MENT AND EVERY CLAUSE OF IT THE SUFFRAGE CLAUSE AS WELL AS THE REST MUST BE SUBMITTED FOR ADOPTION OR REJECTION TO THE VOTERS QUALIFIED UNDER THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY REMAINS IN FULL FORCE UNTIL THE NEW CONSTITUTION IS LEGALLY ADOPTED BUT SUPPOSE IT SHOULD BE DECIDED THAT THE ACT OF 1900 PERMITS THE NEW CONSTITUTION TO BE ADOPTED AND ENACTED BY THE CONVENTION WITH OUT SUBMITTING IT TO THE PEOPLE STILL IT IS THE RIGHT OF THE CONVENTION TO FIRST TAKE THE SENSE OF THE PEOPLE UPON ITS WORK BEFORE FINALLY ADOPT ING IT AND SUCH MIGHT BE REGARDED AS A WISE AND PRUDENT USE OF THE VAST POWERS WITH WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE ENTRUSTED IT AND IN KEEPING WITH THE GENERAL SPIRIT OF OUR

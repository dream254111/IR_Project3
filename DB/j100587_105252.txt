AUSTIN PHYSICIAN IN EDINBURGH DEAR SIR ACCORDING TO YOUR DESIRE I SEND YOU THE HISTORY OF MY CASE WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS READ APRIL 28 1757 I WAS OF AN HEALTHY CONSTITUTION TILL THE YEAR 1730 WHEN I WAS SEIZED WITH A FREQUENT INCLINATION TO MAKE WATER WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS PAIN IN THE KID NEYS OR URETERS THIS SYMPTOM CONTINUED TILL THE YEAR 1733 WITHOUT GIVING ME MUCH UNEASINESS IN JUNE 1733 AS I WAS RIDING FROM EDINBURGH TO MY OWN HOUSE AT PENCAITLAND I WAS SEIZED WITH A GREAT DIFFICULTY AND PAIN IN MAKING WATER WHICH WENT OFF WHEN I GOT HOME IN THE MONTH OF JULY HAVING AGAIN GOT ON HORSE BACK I WAS SEIZED WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT BUT MORE VIOLENT FOR THEN SOME DROPS OF BLOOD CAME AWAY FROM THIS TIME IF I RODE EIGHT OR TEN MILES I PASSED SOME BLOOD BUT WITHOUT PAIN IN SEPTEMBER I MADE A JOURNEY OF 60 MILES ON HORSEBACK BUT EVERY TWO MILES WAS OBLIGED TO DIS MOUNT AND MADE SOME BLOODY WATER I CONTINUED MUCH IN THE SAME WAY ALL THE YEAR 1734 AS THE PRECEDING ONLY HAD ONE ADDITIONAL COMPLAINT OF A PAIN IN THE GLANS AFTER MAKING WATER AND LIKEWISE IN THE NECK OF THE BLADDER THE ONLY THING I DID FOR IT WAS TO DRINK PLENTIFULLY OF WARM MILK AND WATER AND GAVE OVER RIDING ON AC COUNT OF THE BLOODY URINE IN223 IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST I WAS SOUNDED BY MY NEPHEW DR SIMSON PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF ST ANDREWS BUT HE FOUND NO STONE WHICH HE ATTRIBUTED TO A WRONG POSTURE I WAS IN WHEN HE SOUNDED ME DURING THE WINTER IF I WALKED MORE THAN USUAL I WAS SURE TO HAVE A RETURN OF THE BLOODY URINE AND STRANGURY IN NOVEMBER 1735 I WAS SOUNDED BY MR BAL DERSTONE SURGEON IN EDINBURGH A GENTLEMAN VERY EXPERT IN THAT OPERATION AND LIKEWISE BY DR DRUM MOND OF PERTHSHIRE THEY BOTH DISTINCTLY FELT A STONE AND I MYSELF TOOK HOLD OF THE CATHETER WHEN IT WAS IN MY BLADDER AND FELT THE STONE AS DISTINCTLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN IN MY HAND  ABOUT CHRISTMAS I WAS SEIZED WITH A PAIN ALONG THE LEFT URETER AND VIOLENT VOMITINGS BUT UPON USING A TURPENTINE CLYSTER AND OPIATES IT WENT OFF DURING THE YEAR 1736 I CONTINUED MUCH THE SAME AS THE PRECEDING YEAR ALWAYS DRINKING GREAT PLENTY OF MILK AND WATER WHICH GAVE ME GREAT RELIEF AS TO THE BLOODY URINE I WAS ADVISED BY MY NEPHEW DR SIMSON TO GO TO LONDON AND BE CUT BY MR CHESELDEN THE REST OF MY FRIENDS ADVISING ME TO BE CUT BY MR SMITH A LITHOTOMIST AT PERTH HOWEVER I DEFERRED THE OPERA TION AND CONTINUED MUCH THE SAME ALL THE YEAR 1737 HAVING SEVERE FITS NOW AND THEN IN THE YEAR 1738 SIR ALEXANDER GIBSON OF AD DISTON INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD BEEN IN MY CON DITION HAD PASSED SEVERAL SMALL STONES AND HAD FOUND INCREDIBLE SERVICE FROM THE USE OF SOAP PILLS FOR FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE SPACE OF224 OF TWO MONTHS AFTER USING THE SOAP HE WAS ABLE TO GO A HUNTING HOWEVER FOR SOME TIME I WAS AFRAID TO TRY THE SOAP NOT KNOWING WHAT EFFECTS IT MIGHT HAVE ON A CONFIRMED STONE SIR ALEXANDER GIBSONS CASE BEING ONLY THAT OF SMALL STONES BUT THE REV MR LUNDIE OF SALTON BY EXPERIMENTS CONVINCED ME OF THE EFFICACY OF SOAP IN DISSOLVING A CONFIRMED STONE OUT OF THE BLADDER FOR THE STONE GRADUALLY GREW SMOOTHER AND SMOOTHER AND AT LAST WAS QUITE DIS SOLVED ON THE 12TH OF FEBRUARY 1739 I FIRST BEGAN THE USE OF THE SOAP AND IN THE BEGINNING TOOK ONLY A DRACHM IN THE 24 HOURS THE FIRST WEEK IT MADE ME A LITTLE QUALMISH HOWEVER I GRADUALLY INCREASED THE DOSE SO THAT IN SIX WEEKS I TOOK SIX DRACHMS A DAY WITHOUT ITS DISAGREEING IN THE LEAST WITH ME I MADE IT UP INTO PILLS AND WASHED THEM DOWN WITH A DRAUGHT OF WARM MILK AND WATER FROM THE TIME I BEGAN TO USE THE SOAP MY GRA VELISH SYMPTOMS GRADUALLY ABATED BUT UPON WALK ING TWO OR THREE MILES I MADE BLOODY URINE HOW EVER THAT SYMPTOM GRADUALLY ABATED AND IN THE YEAR 1743 ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF A STONE QUITE VANISHED INSOMUCH THAT I COULD WALK RIDE OR GO IN A MA CHINE AS WELL AS EVER FROM FEBRUARY 1739 TO JULY 1743 I TOOK EVERY DAY FIVE OR SIX DRACHMS OF SOAP BUT AFTER THAT TIME I DIMINISHED THE DOSE TO HALF AN OUNCE AND NEVER AFTER HAD ANY RETURN OF A GRAVELISH SYMPTOM THO I STILL IMAGINE THE STONE IS NOT INTIRELY DISSOLVED FOR AFTER SITTING SOME TIME I FIND AS IT WERE SOMETHING COME TO THE NECK OF THE BLADDER BUT WHICH GIVES ME NO UNEASINESS THIS225 THIS SIR ACCORDING TO THE BEST OF MY MEMORY IS MY CASE AND IF IT CAN BE OF ANY BENEFIT TO YOU IN THE CURE OF THIS PAINFUL DISEASE IT WILL GIVE GREAT PLEASURE TO NOV 20TH 1749 DEAR SIR YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT MATTHEW SIMSON THE EXTRACT FROM DR AUSTINS LETTER TO DR PRINGLE T H E REV MR SIMSONS LETTER TO ME WAS WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1749 ABOUT WHICH TIME HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD RIDDEN 40 MILES IN A DAY WITHOUT ANY BAD SYMPTOM ENSUING READ APRIL 28 1757 IN THE YEAR 1752 HE BROKE HIS THIGHBONE AT THE NECK BY A FALL FROM HIS HORSE AND CONTINUED FOR SIX WEEKS IN GREAT PAIN BUT AFTER THAT TIME HE GREW EASIER AND WAS ABLE TO PUT HIS FOOT TO THE GROUND ONE DAY AS HIS SERVANT WAS HELPING HIM TO WALK ACROSS THE ROOM HE LET HIM FALL UPON WHICH MR SIMSON FELT A SEVERE PAIN THE BROKEN LEG BECAME THEN EVI DENTLY SHORTER THAN THE OTHER AND BY THAT MISFOR TUNE HE WAS CONFINED TO HIS BED FOR NEAR TWO YEARS HOWEVER ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE HE DIED HE WAS SO WELL RECOVERED AS TO BE ABLE TO GO TO CHURCH AND TO PERFORM DIVINE SERVICE ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF MAY 1756 MR SIMSON WAS SEIZED WITH A DIARRHAEA WHICH RESISTED ALL MEDI CINE AND CARRIED HIM OFF IN THE 83D YEAR OF HIS AGE FROM THE DATE OF HIS LETTER TO HIS DEATH HE HAD NEVER DISCONTINUED THE USE OF THE SOAP EXCEPT DURING THE TIME V O L 50 G G OF226 OF HIS LAST ILLNESS THO HE HAD NOT BEEN TROUBLED WITH ANY PAINFUL SYMPTOM OF A STONE SINCE THE YEAR 1743 I OBTAINED LEAVE OF HIS FRIENDS TO OPEN THE BODY BUT FOUND NO STONE OR GRAVEL IN THE BLADDER THAT PART APPEARING TO BE IN EVERY RESPECT IN A NATURAL STATE EXCEPT AT THE NECK WHERE THE COATS SEEMED TO BE SCHIRROUS AND WERE ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH THICK IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE STONE HAD BEEN OF A SOFTER TEXTURE AND MORE EASILY DISSOLVED THAN ORDINARY OTHERWISE FIVE OR SIX DRACHMS OF SOAP TAKEN DAILY EVEN FOR SO LONG A TIME COULD NOT HAVE DISSOLVED IT INTIRELY FOR MANY HAVE USED THAT MEDICINE IN MUCH LARGER DOSES AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE DRANK LIMEWATER PLENTIFULLY WITHOUT OBTAINING SUCH EFFECTS THO ALL THEIR PAINFUL SYMPTOMS WERE REMOVED BY THAT COURSE AS DR WHYTT HAS SHEWN IN HIS TREATISE ON THIS SUBJECT I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT MR SIMSONS SON WHO IS NOW MINISTER AT FALA WAS PRESENT AT THE OPENING OF THE BODY AND CAN ATTEST THAT THERE WAS NO STONE FOUND IN THE BLADDER EDINBURGH 15 APRIL 1757 ADAM AUSTIN A LETTER FROM DR ADAM DRUMMOND TO DR ADAM AUSTIN RELATING TO THE REV MR MATTHEW SIMSONS CASE COMMUNICATED BY J PRINGLE MD FRS I HAVE YOURS AND WAS PRESENT WHEN MR BALDERSTONE FOUNDED MR SIMSON AND BOTH OF US PERCEIVED VERY DISTINCTIY A LARGE STONE AND MR SIMSON HIMSELF FELT IT WHICH WE WERE READ JUNE 23 1757227 WERE THE MORE SOLLICITOUS HE SHOULD DO AS HE WAS SOUNDED BEFORE BY DR SIMSON WHO HAD DECLARED THERE WAS NO STONE BUT THE PARTICULAR MAGNITUDE OF IT WE COULD NOT WELL DETERMINE AT THE END OF A LONG CATHETER THO I REMEMBER MR BALDERSTONE WHO WAS WELL VERSED IN THAT BUSINESS CONJECTURED IT TO BE PRETTY LARGE HE WAS SOUNDED ONLY ONCE BY US AS THE URETHRA WAS A LITTLE HURT BY TURNING THE CATHETER THERE IS ONLY ONE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE CASE WHICH MR SIMSON SEEMS TO HAVE OMITTED THAT FROM THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF THE STONE HE PASSED A GREAT DEAL OF MUCUS MIXED WITH PUS AS WELL AS BLOOD AND GREAT QUANTITIES OF GRITTY RED SAND ALL IN SINGLE GRAINS NE VER ANY CONCRETED INTO SMALL STONES I TAKE THE MORE NOTICE OF THIS AS I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT AFTER HE USED THE SOAP HE EVER PASSED ANY SAND BUT A GOOD DEAL OF MUCUS IN WHICH THE SOAP WAS DIS COVERABLE BY ITS FROTHING COULD THE GRITTY PARTICLES OF SAND BE AGAIN SUSPENDED IN THE URINE SO AS TO BE COME INVISIBLE OR WERE THEY WRAPT UP IN THE SOAPY LIQUID SO AS TO ESCAPE OBSERVATION I HAVE SEEN SE VERAL STONES OF A SOFT CONSISTENCE DISSOLVED INTO MU CILAGE BY SOAP BUT THE SAND PASSED BY MR SIMSON BEFORE HE USED THE SOAP SEEMS TO INDICATE HIS STONE OF A HARDER NATURE THO INDEED IT FELT OBTUSE AT THE END OF THE CATHETER I SHALL REJOICE IF MANY INSTANCES OF THIS KIND ARE FOUND AFTERWARDS BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY ONE YET OF A STONE IN THE BLADDER BEING DISSOLVED BY SOAP ALONE I AM BANDEERAN JUNE 5 1757 DEAR DOCTOR YOUR MOST HUMBLE SERVANT ADAM DRUMMOND G G 2

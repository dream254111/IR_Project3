discuss from the standpoint of a teacher the problem of case construction in Caesar It was shown how comparatively small is the number of really different case uses and suggestions were given for making clear to the pupil the fundamental distinctions and the relations existing between these uses There was presented in illustration a chart of case uses for a single book of Caesar If such a method of presenting case constructions has been found helpful it may be said that some such plan for dealing with the uses of the subjunctive in Caesar has been found all but absolutely necessary The unsystematic treatment of the subjunctive in the great majority of first books and grammars makes it next to impossible for the pupil to get anything like a comprehensive view of the subject The table shown with this paper is a compilation from five classroom charts each covering one book except that Book I is divided at the end of chap xxix the remaining chaps xxx to liv being read after the completion of Book IV and is here treated as a separate unit One important fact is at once apparent The subjunctive is not found in independent sentences in Caesar IIV but is used only in various subordinate clauses This limitation is of course due to the narrative indirectquotation form of the writing The problem of mood usage is thus greatly simplified and attention is concentrated where attention is most needed The uses of the subjunctive in wishes exhortations or conditions as such have no place in Caesar and the corollary of that proposition would certainly exclude elaborate treatment of these uses from prose composition books based on Caesar 1Published in the School Review March I909 564Uses of the Subjunctive in Caesar IIV CLASSIFICATION OF CLAUSES INTRODUCTORY Bk I

the subjunctive in Caesar there fore resolves itself into a classification of those dependent clauses which have their verbs in the subjunctive Here as in case con structions the aim is to get the pupil to group related uses The first great division made is between those subjunctives expressing the various nonfact modal ideas for which the English transla tion is a subjunctive or equivalent verb phrase or an infinitive and those subjunctives expressing fact the English equivalent of which is the indicative This fundamental division is indicated on the chart by the heavy line Within these groups as indicated clauses are classified according to form and specific use As was pointed out in the discussion of case constructions categories are set up not only to accord with welldefined distinctions within the Latin itself but whenever the English idiom differs materially from the Latin A case in point is the subjunctive in the Clause of Purpose which is clearly volitive in Latin while the English mood for such a clause is potential and such a subjunctive is commonly translated if a finite form is used at all by a verb phrase with the auxiliary may or might It is very unfortunate for the clear under standing of the subjunctive as a whole that so many first books begin their treatment of the mood with this irregularly translated Clause of Purpose with the tragic result that many pupils come to regard this use as normal and ever after say or try to say may or might every time they encounter a subjunctive even when a modicum of linguistic sense would compel the use of the proper auxiliary or still more often the plain English indicative2 A much more common and much more typical use 2The following beautiful specimen of the translators art taken from Clarks Interlinear Caesar Book IV chap xi is an illustration in point the italics are mine When Caesar might be distant from the enemy not more than twelve thousands of paces the ambassadors return to him as it had been appointed who having met him on the march did pray greatly he would not advance farther When they might have obtained not that they did request that he would send before to those horsemen who might have preceded the troop and would prohibit them from battle and that he would make power to themselves of sending am bassadors unto the Ubii if the chiefs and senate of whom might have made faith to themselves by oath they did show themselves about to use that condition which might be brought by Caesar he might give the space of three days to 565THE SCHOOL REVIEW of the subjunctive than to express purpose and one which has an exact equivalent in English is found in the substantive clause usually object or subject of a verb of volition command urging or the like for example I insist that he come English sub junctive or using the English auxiliaries shall or should I insist present that he shall come I insisted past that he should come There are 133 of these clauses in the first four books of Caesar as against 57 clauses expressing purpose as is shown in the table THE NONFACT SUBJUNCTIVES Under the general head of volitive belong 240 of the 344 nonfact subjunctives Subdivision within this group is justi fied even necessitated by the difference of idiom in the two languages that is to say by the problem of translation This is especially true of the last three uses within this group Another important nonfact use of the subjunctive and one that has not generally received the recognition due it is that in clauses of anticipation or expectancy In earlier English the sub junctive is common in this use The regular auxiliary as in most volitive uses is shall or should for example Remain until I shall return I urged that he should volitive remain until I should anticipatory return or I expected to see him when I should return Such forwardlooking clauses after a past main verb as in the last example are here classed as past future and always have their verbs in the subjunctive in Latin This use is especially common in pastfuture conditional clauses That is to say after a past main verb the distinction is lost between a future more vivid shall condition and a future less vivid should condition the verb becoming in either instance an imperfect subjunctive The English usage shows an exact parallel the auxiliaries shall or should becoming or remaining should after a past main verb This change in Latin is not therefore due to Indirect Discourse but is in the writers opinion one of the leading causes of that usage in Latin those things to be accomplished Caesar did think all these to tend to that same point that the delay of three days having been interposed the cavalry of them who might be absent might return 566SYNTAX IN CAESAR There are 70 examples of this pastfuture subjunctive in Caesar IIV all to be translated by should if one wishes to be exact By a recognition of this usage the pupils faith in the auxiliary should as a probable translation of a nonfact sub junctive is greatly increased relying on which even the most stupid will arrive much more often than not Of the other nonfact subjunctives I need not speak in detail The notes in the text are usually adequate and their very rareness renders them easy for the pupil to remember It is the common everywheremet constructions that need to be impressed in teaching THE FACT SUBJUNCTIVE Almost twothirds of the subjunctives here being discussed 628 out of 972 express fact and are with scarcely an excep tion best translated by the English indicative In other words if a Caesar pupil failed absolutely to recognize twothirds of his subjunctives the right twothirds however and proceeded to translate them as indicatives he would be quite as well off as far as his translation is concerned The troublesome question is Which twothirds To determine this a detailed subdivision of these fact clauses is necessary The Consecutive Clauses make up a welldefined group Result clauses and the closely related substantive clauses are most typical Here belong the relative descriptive clauses and the developed cumclauses At this point a glance at the statistics often the result of very arbitrary decisions it must be confessed will show what is the best guess at the translation for the con junction cum or to speak more accurately one may here see in many instances how the cumclause descriptive of a situation may take on the added idea of cause or opposition and it is only when one or the other of these ideas becomes preeminent that the translation since or although is better than when The same development is shown in the threefold classification based entirely on differences in translation of the relative descriptive characteristic clauses The use of the subjunctive in Clauses of Fact in Indirect Dis 567THE SCHOOL REVIEW course need no special mention Whatever theories may be held as to the origin of this usage it is certainly true that in classical Latin this use of the subjunctive is a mere mechanical device for showing that the clause is a part of an indirect quotation a sort of half quotation mark as it were I need not add that under this head should be classified only such clauses as would in direct form have their verbs in the indicative Here belong of course only those Indirect Questions about facts Indirect Questions of Volition or Propriety are classed as such The general scheme for the subjunctive in this department thus furnishes as a sort of byproduct a fairly complete list of those clauses which do regularly have their verbs in the indicative These need not to have been given so much in detail and the writer does not so give them in the single wall charts for each book of which as was said at the beginning this table is a compilation In the last group are given clauses having their verbs in the subjunctive by attraction a quite definite phenomenon in Latin usage the origin of which need not be here discussed The practical thing for the pupil to do here as well as in dealing with clauses in indirect discourse when he finds a verb in the sub junctive which he knows ought to be in the indicative is to apologize for it so to speak on the ground that it is in indirect discourse or attracted and then go ahead and translate it as if it were in the indicative The aim in such a presentation as has here been discussed is to secure and fix in the mind of the pupil a sound basis for classifi cation with suggestions for proper translation of the subjunctive in its varied yet quite definite uses When on taking up the reading of Caesar the pupil meets for the first time what may seem to him an endless variety of subjunctives he should be saved from complete mystification and the attendant temptation to regard the whole thing as a guessing contest first and last Even worse is the error of mechanically translating all sub junctives alike an error fostered by the stock translations of the subjunctive in the paradigms of some first books and gram mars Of the two errors I say the former is less danger ous For inasmuch as the two languages have much in common 568SYNTAX IN CAESAR 569 in their modal machinery the pupil will succeed in an adequate translation of a given subjunctive in direct proportion to his feeling for correct English especially if we count out the large number of fact subjunctives he may miss altogether The diffi culty however is that such a method leaves the pupil always a guesser and English as well as Latin grammar greatly needs intelligent systematic treatment and in no field is this need more apparent than in the use of the muchneglected English sub junctive

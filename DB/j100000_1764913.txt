BeaZ Engznes BY CECIL H PEABODY New York Wiley 8 5 THE author of this book is associate professor of steam engi neeriltg in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the book is intended mainly for the pse of students in that and similar technical institutions He presents in a clear manner and with a minimum of mathematical expression the general theory of ther modynamics and his treatment of the properties of gases and va pors and of the injector presents sexeral novel and interesting features especially in the comparisons with experiments More novel stil and more valuable to the student who intends to adopt steamengineeling as a profession is the authors treatment of the steam engine He has considered it advisable to leave untouched all approximate theories based upon the assumption of adiabatic changes of steam inthe cylinder of the engine making instead a systematic study of actual tests of engines in use for which pur pose a arge nurober of test recoTds harJe been collected arranged and compared This will enable the student to learn what is ac tually known on the subject and will point out to him the direction in uhich luture investigations wil gire the best results as well as show him how and where improvements may be made It vvill be gathered from the foregoing that this book differs in some parts either in substance or in manner of presentation from other textbooks on the subject but in general commonlyaccepted Inethods have been followed The formal presentation of thermo dynamics is the same as that employed by most authorities and presents clearly the many difficulties of the subject besides making plain the processes employed The author gixes cpecial attention to the inxestigations of theWS HEAVEN AND HELLy by EMAN UEL SWEDENBORG 4X6

the United States illustrated by a number of fine litho graphic plates painted by hand in the colors of nature The vol umes will be profusely illustrated wholly from nature the number of engravings in

work can be readily followed by any intelligent and sympathetic reader This is especially true of Volume II The publication of such a considerable work has involved a large ex pense and as the

tient an artist of talent and originality has continued his paint ing and latterly busiecl himself with the composition and illustra tion of a manuscript book of two hundred pages The six plates accompanying this article reproduce nearly fifty pictures of which three are taken for comparison from his preasylum work and two thirds of the rest are penandink drawings from the book Con iderable extracts both of prose and verse are given the latter especially showing the same mixture of facility and imperfect finish that characterizes his picture8 It is rare that an alienist has the opportunity of observing a case where the disordered mind has such varied and delicate means of expressing itself The next article is an experimental study by Dr C F Hodge of the effect of electrical stimulation upon ganglion cells The outcome of these careful experiments is a method  by which changes due to functional activity can be as easily and certainly demonstrated in a ganglion as in a gland Electrical stimulation noticeably decreases the size of the nucleus makes it jagged in outline obscures its reticulation and Inakes its stain darker In the cell protoplasm it causes vacuolation and slight shrinkage and makes its stain less readily The nuclei of the cell capsule are also shrunken These changes are figured in an accompanying plate In the third article Dr E C Sanford concludes his series on per sonal equations taking up especially the amount and cause of personal differences under the simplest conditions of observation He brings together the contributions of the astronomers and physiological psychologists and considers the theories of Bessel Wolf and others A bibliography of a hundred titles or more is appended Dr W H Burnham furnishes a very interesting paper on the illusions and hallucinations of memory or as the phenomena have been termed paramnesia An example of a single class is the not uncommon feeling of strange familiarity irl totally unfamiliar circumstances Other kinds are rarerbut by no means urlknown Important contributions have come from the alienists notably from Kraepelin whose classification Dr Burnham follows The author has been fortunate in collecting a number of illustrative cases such tricks of memory seem frequent in dreams with some people at least which parallel in normal life the grosser cases of the in sane The subject has also a practical bearing for Hughlings Jackson while admitting that the feeling of reminiscence above mentioned does occur in normal people would regard its frequent occurrence as a confirmatory symptom of a certain form of epilepsy In persons of somewhat defective memory and judgment as chil dren and old people a skilful lawyer can by proper manipulation create entirely without the consciousness of the witness a memory of events that never happened and like Professor Royce the author would account for many cases of presentiments telepathy etc reported by trustworthy people as cases of pseudomemory The number contains as usual reviews and abstracts of literature on the nervous system and experimental and abnormal psychologys besides miscellaneous notes In the abnormal section is included also a paper of practical suggestions to physicians in asylumss hospitals etc for the observation of patients suffering from mental and nervous diseases by Dr H H Donaldson The suggestions are accompanied throughout by references to the literature LETTERS TO rHE EDITOR CorresysondfenGs are rezesGed Go be as brief as fiossibSe The wriGers name zsr in aU cases reqzEred as

noticed here after sun down of July I3 On the I4th and I5th it seemed to increase in intensity After this it declined and I think could not be clearly distinguished after the 20th I noted a whitish glow around the sunoccupying a space of about fifteen degrees radius as in  Bishops ring The outer colored ring characteristic of that corona seemed to be entirely lacking I have remarked the following peculiarities in which these differ from the Krakatoa glows they are very much less bright perhaps like those after a lapse of several months A notable difference is in a beautiful tertiary glow This con sisted of a rich and delicate rosy flush occupying a tract of sky in the west say of sixty degrees horizontally and from five down to ten degrees of altitude At the edges this melted into purple upon the clear blue of our North Pacific sky A faint purple tint extended along the horizon quite to the south no color in the north There are islands a little north of west intercepting re flections This third glow failed to gather down and deepen upon the horizon like those preceding it I think its tint the most beau tiful I have ever seen in the heavens like that of some rare and perfect jewel A very marked peculiarity is the early time at which the primary and secondary glows take place The primary glow gathers soon after the sun is down and is at its height while daylight is yet strong Hence it is less conspicuous although its broad streaming radiations of glowing surface are very remarkable The secondary glow promptly follows and makes the grand dis play It is nearly finished lefore any stars are visible The Irakatoa secondary began in a somewha t darkened sky as dark as vvhen the late tertiary appearedand lingered until after full darkness slowly settling down into a low dense bloodred stratum which simulated the reflection of a remote conflagration That strange dullred glow was entirely absent from the late appearances The secondary gathered and settled away in a bright orange glow Both at its close and throughout its course this secondary substantially resembled the Krakatau primary as seen several months after the eruption Like that it presented at its close a welldefined and serrated upper edge bordered by dark sky The serrations of the latter however were small and numer

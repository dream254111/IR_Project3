AND THEIR RELATION TO MANAGERS OF EMPLOYMENT IN INDUSTRY BY HILDA MUHLHAUSER Director Girls  Womens Bureau StateCity Labor Exchange Cleveland For many years indeed since 1892 public employment bureaus have sprung into existence to provide a clearing house for the em ployer and the unemployeda labor market where the employer could make known his demands and the seekers after work could make known their abilities As time has gone on the public employ ment bureaus have come to serve almost entirely the common labor market so that the American public today looks upon these bureaus as a clearing house not for all the laboring classes but for that portion whose work is entirely of a physical nature Grad ually however the standard once set by public employment bureaus is being raised even as these bureaus are ceasing to be located in basements and are being placed on the ground floors so are they now compelling the industrial world to realize that they do stand on the ground floor in this modern cycle of industrial unrest and overwhelming unemployment Of the public employ ment bureaus in America not including private employment bureaus only one has undertaken the tremendous task of raising the entire standard of public employment bureaus so as to meet the need of the managers of employment in industry I refer to the Cleveland office which not only is a center for the laborer and the employer demanding skilled and unskilled labor but is also a magnet that draws to it the college graduate the specialized men and women who never before dreamed of using a public employ ment office A vocational guidance department a recreation and also an immigration department mark this Cleveland office as unique among the public employment bureaus in the country and the Cleveland idea is but a beginning in the vast plan that shall eventually make the public employment bureau the great tool at the command of the managers of employment in industry 170PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT BUREAUS 171 The Cleveland plan briefly stated is this First to centralize the labor market by taking over all the employment departments of separate organizations such as the Young Womens Christian Association the settlements and institutions Included in this group of independent organizations was the Vocational Guidance Bureau the forerunner of the present Girls  Womens Bureau which as a private organization maintained by private funds was consolidated with the womens department of the StateCity Labor Exchange As a result of this combination the Girls  Womens Bureau of Cleveland began to carry on in a vital and effective way its centralized work Financial support was secured from both the state of Ohio and the city of Cleveland In spite of the fact that both their budgets were reduced to comply with their platform of economy the state and city granted initial funds this year to carry on our work The Bureau therefore is financed by city state and private funds After an investigation of private employment agencies was made we found that many of these agencies were not only mis representing the positions they offered but were actually sending girls to houses of illrepute Although the private agencies fought us through the courts a city ordinance was adopted on February 15 1915 regulating private employment agencies As a result of this ordinance thirteen of the thirtyfive agencies failed to comply with the regulations and disbanded Our next step was to centralize community interest to secure the co6peration of employers labor organizations and interested individuals In order that our Bureau obtain as broad a view of conditions as possible our advisory board which met monthly was composed of representatives of labor and capital and local organizations such as social settlements and the chamber of com merce the retail merchants board and the federation of labor The vital problems involved in the placing of girls and women were discussed and many ideas of immediate practical value often had their birth at these meetings For instance at the time of the garment strike we decided that our position as a public employ ment bureau was not to side with either the manufacturers or the strikers but to avoid sending girls to those factories involved without first telling them the exact conditions prevailing Our fair attitude on this question won for us the approval of both sides172 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY It was always our policy to investigate employers calls and our survey of Cleveland industries carefully and thoroughly made enabled us to do intelligent placing We secured all information concerning hours wages sanitary conditions busy seasons and opportunities for advancement We faithfully live up to our slogan Never send a girl to an uninvestigated place Thus through personal investigation we are able to save the girl from the possibility of exploitation Not only do we investigate employers but also all applicants for work Our corps of investigators includes a group of twenty five trained workers many of whom volunteer their services We secured the industrial and home record of all girls We went even further and secured the co6peration of school teachers who sent to us those children who intended to leave school Our vocational guidance department often prevailed upon these young folks to stay in school and in many instances when financial stress prevented them from continuing their education we pro vided scholarships through a fund established by the Federation of Womens Clubs Our followup work finding out what becomes of those appli cants we place is continuously done for one year after they enter industry The result of our complete records was an understanding of each applicant which while unobtainable by employers was absolutely invaluable to them For instance if an employment manager for some economic reason or as a matter of preference wished to secure girls who were living at home there was no avenue through which he could obtain such girls other than our Bureau Thus progressive employment managers came to realize that one way of reducing the labor turnover of girls and women was by having a personal interest in them as well as by securing in return the vital active interest of the employe in her work To this end the employers found the Girls  Womens Bureau an essential factor for the efficiency of their own business and in one month 17000 calls for girls and women were received In time perhaps 1The class in Sociology of Western Reserve University also give volunteer service to the Girls  Womens Bureau under the supervision of the director They do special investigating and receive credit in their college course for this workPUBLIC EMPLOYMENT BUREAUS 173 all employment managers will come to realize the value of using public employment bureaus Think of the time wasted by em ployment managers in interviewing the applicants many altogether unqualified who flock in large numbers in response to newspaper advertisements or helpwanted bulletins Consider too from an economic standpoint the saving it would be to employers to forego the large item of expense involved in advertising by utilizing a Bureau such as ours conducted in a fair and intelligent manner Why is it necessary thus to build and create ideal public employment bureaus why is it important in this modern day of advertising with all the many avenues for reaching and securing labor why should the public employment bureaus be the central exchange where labor and capital shall meet and bargain First of all because the public employment bureau commands the confi dence of the workingman and woman which the private bureau and in most cases the employment managers themselves have failed to gain Just as a mother trustingly sends her child to public school because she has faith in the state just as men send repre sentatives to Congress having faith in the nation so does labor send her children of modern industry trustingly to the public employment bureau knowing they have but to knock and they will be admitted to the house of opportunity Secondly that great waste which every year in normal times constitutes over 3000000 ablebodied men out of work at least three months of the year that great economic waste can at least partially be stemmed by the joint efforts of all the public employ ment bureaus At the first conference on employment held in San Francisco August 2 called by Hon W B Wilson United States Secretary of Labor the nucleus of a plan was drawn whereby all city state and federal bureaus all public employment bureaus shall be linked together in one unending chain of opportunity for the unemployed A committee of twelve was appointed repre senting the city state and federal groups which shall work on plans in detail for carrying out this great nationwide idea the central thought being to bring the man and the job together not only in one state but in every state to bring the supply of labor174 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY to that place where there is a demand to transfer the oversupply of labor to those localities where it can be utilized2 With such concentrated and widespread effort as this city statefederal plan involves the managers must realize that the public employment bureaus are a force and power in the labor market of the country and knowing this cannot afford to ignore them in the vast employment departments in industry Everyone is crying out in protest against the wasteful labor turnover em ployers and managers are seeking some solution to this drag on the wheels of modern industry I firmly believe and others who have given the matter a great deal of thought agree with me that if the managers of employment in industry and the leaders of citystatefederal employment bureaus would get together the cylinder through which this waste flows unstemmed would have a bottom and a top to check the shifting labor conditions The public employment bureaus being the bottom would stop the leakage caused by the inability of the employe to find the place for which he is best fitted The employ ment managers would be the top conserving the best ability which they have thus secured so as to keep it from flowing out only to be turned over and over True it is that seasonal occupations are a factor in contributing to the cause of unemployment But if we would give the question our best thought even this great obstacle might be partially re moved If a man picks cotton in the southern cotton fields for a short season only why not send him when that work is completed to the place where he can do other work of a similar nature And 2 Committee membersChairman Ethelbert Stewart chief statistician of the United States

Virginia where there is a demand The United States Secretary of Labor hopes to have a bill put through Congress making it possible for the railroads to grant reduced rates to such men and also to women who are leaving one place to find work in another under city state or federal guidance This will be a great common denominator in the labor equation The employment managers in industry should utilize this vital force and codperate in carrying out this plan Of course there may be danger places the question of unions and other organizations will arise but only by the combined efforts of employ ment managers railroad magnates labor unions and citystate federal employment bureaus can any scheme for the distribution of labor be successful Just as a small employment bureau if it be successful invites the co6peration of all elements concerned or effected so must this larger plan of distribution when launched be manned by a crew of sturdy thinkers and workers on the wild tossing sea of industrial competition and labor unrest The managers of employment in industry cannot possibly solve the question alone the government cannot solve it alone the laborer cannot solve it alone capital cannot solve it alone even with commerce and opportunity by its side but the moulding together of all these elements in the great melting pot of cooperation stirred by the master resource shall in the end produce the well balanced figures of labor and capital hand in hand on the heights of the world with their child satisfaction peacefully following after them

GEO F ATKINSON Secretary SCIENTIFIC BOOKS PUBLICATIONS OF THE EARTHQUAKE INVESTI GATION COMMITTEEIN FOREIGN LANGUAGES NUMBERS 3 AND 4 TOKYO1900 THERE is one science which the Japanese have practically made their own Blessed or cursed according to how you look at it by the frequent occurrence of earthquakes and blessed certainly by the presence of a large number of able and enthusiastic students of physical science Japan has become within twenty years a vast seismological laboratory in which seismic phenomena are being studied as they never were before Indeed modern seismology had its birth there and there it has been and is being most carefully nurtured About twenty years ago there were in Japan a considerable number of foreigners employed as professors of engineering geology physics etc and of necessity they became interested in the one characteristic natural phenomenon the unpleas antly frequent manifestations of which none of them will ever forget In the observational study of earthquakes one of them Professor John Milne FRS now residing on the Isle of Wight then Pro fessor of Geology in the School of Engineering exhibited a zeal and enthusiasm together with untiring patience and fertility of resource be yond all others and mostly through his efforts the Seismological Society of Japan was or ganized In its organization and maintenance the foreign professors received the hearty cp operation of the Japanese officials in the Uni versity and out of it For several years the society issued annual volumes of Proceedings the great value of which has been everywhere recognized The gradual and finally almost complete withdrawal of foreigners from the educational work of the country resulted at last in the suspension of the active work of the so ciety but happily this did not occur before the Japanese had come to realize fully the impor tance of the work it had done and indeed not until a number of their own young men had been fully trained to carry that work on In 1891 official interest in seismology took definite form in the passage of a vote by the Chamber of Peers or House of Lords upon the initiative of one of its members Dr Dairoku Kikuchi now President of the Imperial Uni versity of Japan By a large majority the Cabinet was urged to appoint an Earthquake Investigation Committee and on June 25 1892 an Imperial Ordinance was promulgated estab lishing such a Commission and naming its members Its duties were defined in a general way in this Ordinance and the payment to its members of a small annual salary was author ized The Committee prepared a very elaborate and comprehensive scheme of work which it has fol lowed pretty closely up to the present The President is Dr Kikuchi and Dr Omori of the Faculty of Sciences of the Imperial University is Secretary There are nearly thirty mem bers including professors of pure and applied sciences in the University engineers archi tects etc It has been the wise practice of the Com mittee to publish its principal proceedings and most important papers in foreign languages and of the two under review No 3 is mostly in the French language and No 4 is in English One of the principal objects of the Committee is to consider the practical aspects of seismology with a view to a lessening of the loss of life 678 SCIENCENOVEMBER 2 1900 damage to buildings and other structures as far as may be found possible so that much attention has been given to studies of resistance of materials of construction and to the effect of actual earthquakes upon existing structures of various kinds No 3 consists in the main of an account of a most elaborate and in teresting experimental investigation of some of the more important physical properties of bricks and briquettes of cement mortar etc especial attention being given to those qualities which give strength and stability against seismic disturbance This report is by S Tanabe a member of the Committee and is a valuable contribution to our knowledge of the subject There is also in the same volume a short description by B Mano of a machine by which a platform or shaking table is made to oscillate as it would during the passage of a series of seismic waves the horizontal and vertical motions being produced independ ently each capable of adjustment as to ampli tude and frequency so that almost any kind of disturbance may be imitated except minute earth  tremors The motive power consists of two steam engines and as many as 270 oscilla tions per minute may be maintained There is also a brief note on the damage suffered by tall chimneys in the earthquake of June 1894 and in that of October 1893 In the case of the latter 230 chimneys in all were examined rang ing in height from 30 feet to 150 feet Of these 53 suffered serious injury the highest per centage being for those between 60 feet and 80 feet high The volume closes with a paper in English on The Scope of the Volcanological Survey in Japan by Dr B Koto member of the Committee who has undertaken to study the geological aspects of the seismic problem For the great majority of earthquakes the author rejects the volcanistic hypothesis and adopts the tectonic believing that seismic dis turbances are intimately related to the process of mountain building No 4 begins with a condensed statement on the Construction of Earthquakeproof Wooden Buildings Although very brief this paper is of great interest and as nearly all houses in Japan are built of wood it must prove to be of great practical value Rules for the making of joints the construction of frame work and especially of roof framing are given with sufficient detail and clearness aided by numerous illustrations and particular emphasis is placed on the character of the foundation Even ordinarily constructed wooden houses are damaged less by earthquake disturbances than structures of brick or stone and when built according to the rules and suggestions given in this paper they will be generally im mune except during unusually violent shocks The worst part of an ordinary Japanese house from the seismic standpoint is the heavy tile roof and the importance of making the roof as light as possible and of having the tile securely fastened is dwelt upon in this compendium The use of iron plates and straps with bolts in the formation of joints is strongly advised It may be interesting to note here that the new palace for the use of the Prince Imperial is to be a modern structural steel affair the material having been obtained in this country and in the structural plans made by American architects especial care has been exercised to provide against damage by earthquake By the use of numerous cross braces and  ties it is made to resemble some what a huge steel basket which although it may and indeed should be capable of a little elastic yielding can never be seriously injured in any imaginable seismic disturbance Anent the generally damaging effect of earthquakes upon brick buildings Dr F Omori discusses the records of a number of disturb ances as shown by two of Professor Ewings horizontal pendulum seismographs one of which was set up on a wall 6f a large brick building known as the Engineering College and the other on the ground near by Ten earthquakes were thus observed and recorded none being very strong The results appear to show that in comparatively long period oscilla tions that is to say those somewhat above 5 second there was no noticeable difference in amplitude between those of the second story of the brick building and those of the ground while with quick period motions the movement was greater on the wall of the building than on the ground the average amplitude of the former being double that of the latter Omori SCIENCE 679N S VOL XII No 305 calls attention to the fact that injury to brick buildings by earthquakes is nearly always much greater in the upper stories than in the lower and he illustrates this by photographs of the condition after the great earthquake of 1891 of the Aichi Cotton Mill and the Post and Telegraph Office both at Nagoya The Charles ton earthquake in 1886 afforded many examples of this Omori furnishes two very interesting notes on the great earthquakes of 1891 and 1894 These are the most violent disturbances that Japan has suffered in recent years and that of October 28 1891 was probably at least equal in inten sity to any other earthquake of which we have authentic record Its greatest activity was dis played in the provinces of Mino and Owari The land area disturbed was about 250000 square kilometers and as the mean radius of propagation was about 520 kilometers the total shaken area was about double the area of the whole empire The total number of people killed was 7000 and 80000 houses were en tirely destroyed The fact that only one life was lost for every 11 houses destroyed illustrates when compared with the effects of earthquakes in brick and stonebuilding countries the greater safety of wooden houses which even when destroyed afford ample warning and time to enable their inmates to escape The actual motion in this earthquake was no where satisfactorily recorded on seismographs but Omori has made up for this lack as far as possible by the observation and calculation of a large number of overturned stone lanterns and tomb stones noting as well those not over turned The horizontal acceleration necessary to overturn is calculated by Wests formula which is very simple and unquestionably very nearly correct under the conditions considered It is x y in which g is the acceleration due to gravity and x and y the horizontal and vertical coordi nates of the center of gravity of the column the origin being the edge about which overturning takes place It is assumed that the motion is entirely horizontal which introduces no sensible error except for points very near the epifocus Results are computed for about sixty points in the disturbed area and in several instances a horizontal acceleration of over 400 centime ters per second is shown The seismograph at Nagoya one of the principal points shows that the complete period of the principal vibra tions was about 13 seconds and as the maxi mum acceleration there was 260 cm it follows that the range or amplitude of vibration of the earth particle was between 23 cm and 24 cm The earthquake of June 20 1894 although the most violent experienced in the Tokyo dis trict since 1855 was much less strong than that of the MinoOwari district referred to above Twentysix persons were killed and 171 were wounded Fortunately the disturbance was very satisfactorily recorded by a strongmotion seismograph at the Seismological Observatory in Tokyo The actual amplitude of horizontal motion was 73 cm and the maximum ac celeration was about 100 cm per second In the greater shock of 1891 this was probably not less than 1000 cm per sec per secbeing a little greater than the acceleration due to gravity Dr H Nagaoka has a very interesting paper on the experimental determination of the elastic constants of rocks leading to important conclu sions relating to the velocity of seismic waves From observations made in Italy and also in Japan Omori has concluded that the velocity of the first tremor is generally as high as 13 kilo meters per second which is surprisingly great the principal shocks usually showing a speed of 3 kilometers to 4 kilometers per second Nagaoka discusses the conditions under which the very high velocities may occur and one cannot avoid being impressed with the great value of earthquake observations as a means of ascertaining the nature and conditions of the interior of the earth The greatest part of No 4 consists of an ac count by Omori of an elaborate series of Experimental Studies upon Fracturing and Overturning Columns and this is not only one of the most interesting but perhaps the most important paper in the whole series In this investigation the shaking table already re ferred to was made use of and columns of con siderable dimensions and various materials were used Many were of dimensions equal to those 680 SCIENCENOVEMBER 2 1900 of the stone lanterns and tombstones made use of in computing the intensity of the MinoOwari earthquake The accelerations necessary to overturn were also calculated by Wests for mula and it is surprising to see how closely they accord with those obtained from the graphic record of the shaking table Because the contents of these volumes are made up of carefully conducted observations of actual and very strong earthquakes for the first time recorded by means of satisfactory in struments together with elaborate experimental investigations of important related phenomena and because all these results are fully dis cussed with remarkable skill and keen scientific insight it is perhaps not too much to say that they constitute the most valuable contributions yet made to the literature of seismology Even those who know the men who are do ing this work through familiar association and often close personal relations cannot avoid a feeling of astonishment at the extraordinary performances of a people whose contact with the world at large has been only that of the present generation and with whom the so called civilized nations have been strangely and unreasonably unwilling to treat on a basis of equality until within three or four years When I reflect that seismology is only one of the many sciences in which in original research the Japanese are well in the front rank and this too without the inspiring example of an ancestral Galileo Newton La Place Hum boldt or Franklin I wish to do figuratively what I have done many times actuallyI take off my hat to an oriental nation that in peace or in war need ask no odds of Europe or America T C MENDENHALL Rapports prgsentW au Congrs International de Mecanique appliqu6e  Exposition Universelle de 1900 Tome I Ci DUNOD Editeur Paris 1900 8vo Pp 546 The various congresses of the Paris Expo sition of 1900 are now bringing out their pub lished papers and discussions and the royal octavo volumes of the Congress of Applied Me chanics are finely illustrative of the character of the work performed at these conventions and of the manner in which it is to be published Of the innumerable books printed relating to the Exposition these are the most valuable and to the serious student of that great cyclo pedia most interesting The questions dis cussed in Vol I are nine in number  Organi zation of Works   Organization of Mechanical Laboratories   Mechanical Applications of Electricity   Hoisting Apparatus   Hydraulic Motors  Sectional Boilers 7  Highspeed En gines   Heat Motors   Automobilisme The first topic is discussed by M Touissant who presents a study of the manufacturing establishment generally and Mr Dickie who gives a most interesting account of the organi zation and administration of the Union Iron Works of San Francisco the birthplace of the famous battleship Oregon and the source of innumerable steamships steamengines and pumping and winding engines and of mining and manufacturing machinery in enormous amount M Boulvin discusses the organization of mechanical laboratories and his valuable paper is introductory to that of Dwelshauvers who describes that of the University of Li6ge organized by him after years of struggle and strife with the ultraconservative administra tion of the University and the Government The evolution of the mechanical laboratory in America as an element of technical instruc tion is described by Thurston and includes papers by a number of representatives of engi neering schools in the United States giving ac counts of an equal number of the most exten sive and interesting laboratories of that class in our country The development of the labora tory of applied mechanics and its accessories as a means of instruction primarily and as an item in the equipment of the technical school and as an essential element of the curriculum was first effected satisfactorily in the United States The European schools are now com ing to the same plan in rapidly increasing numbers often modeling after our own in both equipment and methods of employment An other instructive division of this subject is dis cussed by Commandant Mengen who tells of the organization and the details of equipment of the laboratory of the ordnance department of the French army which is very extensive SCIENCE 681N S VOL XII No 305 and complete and is evidently conducted in a modern and fruitful manner The third  question  includes a paper by Dr Kennelly describing mechanical applications of electricity especially as observed in the United States Messrs Delmas and Henry discuss the use of the current in hoisting ma chinery and in the establishments of public works departments M BassOres discusses the fourth question and especially the work of the Compagnie des FivesLillie Hydraulic mo tors as constructed in Switzerland the home of that form of prime mover 18891900 are reported upon by M Prazill M Rateau writes of their theory and construction as illustrated by cpntemporary practice in general DrW F Durand takes up the sixth topic and gives an account complete and exact of the wa tertube boilers employed in the United States and M Brillie also discusses the  chaudieres a petits 61ements their classification efficiency operation with characteristic thoroughness MM Lefer and Lecornu write of highspeed engines and of regulators the former including the ancient Greek type just revived the steam turbine Thermic Motors apparently only intending to include the gasengines in the class are the subject of valuable papers by MM Diesel who reports on his own invention and construction by Mr Donkin who discusses those employing the waste gases of the blast furnace and by M Witz the well known au thority on that class of motor who tells of gasengines of large power employed in metal lurgy The final discussion in this volume is that of automobilisme by MM Rochet Cue not and Mesnager All the papers here published have special value in their several departments of applied science and some of them are extremely im portant The contributors to the volume are usually French writers and practitioners of au thority a few are American and we recognize the name of but one German in the list The German government took a leading part in the Exposition and German exhibitors abounded as did German visitors but the scientific men of Germany in this department at least seem to have held aloof The book is a fine sample of the style and finish of the French official document In paper type and finish and illustration while not what a French critic would consider illus trative of a high class of bookmaking it is for its place and purpose most excellent In many cases of condensation and of abstracting on the part of the editors as especially in the case of the descriptions of American mechan ical laboratories where the original contained very extensive and very extensively illustrated details the necessary work of merciless con densation has been in the main very well done The translations from the English into the French are so far as a first rapid survey would indicate excellently performed The collection will have great and permanent value to the engineer and to the professor of engi neering as well as to all having interest in these divisions of applied mechanics R H THURSTON The Antarctic Regions By DR KARL FRICKER Translated by A SONNENSCHEIN New York The Macmillan Company 1900 Pp xii  292 With many maps and illustrations Price 300 In view of the widely extended interest in the Antarctic region at the present time it would seem as though it would almost be unneces sary to say that this was a timely production It is however not the only requisite of a book that it is timely Its substance should be of a high character and its form of statement should be clear In this particular case the historical portion of the work is good but its character is marred by too great condensation This fact alone would make it a poor book to put in the hands of the general reader who is looking for pleasure as well as for information Even if the original work was intended for the scientific man the translator should have had tact enough to recognize the fact that it was not at all neces sary to follow the German construction of the sentences too closely A good translation should take some account of the spirit of the language into which the work is to be rendered and not make its perusal a burden by the introduction of too many parenthetical sentences Of course in such a work as this much new information is not to be expected and the major portion of 682 SCIENCENOVEMBER 2 1900 the book is given over to a historical summary of the various voyages to the South Polar re gion But that is no reason for closing this sec tion of the book with the following sentence p 131 This survey indicates what parts of the Antarctic regions have principally been visited and sums up how much or how little has been achieved by each attempt It will be the aim of the subsequent pages to gather into a whole the results of all these explorations so far as their fragmentary nature renders such a task possible This portion of the book is followed by a de scription of the conformation of the surface and geological structure which would be a very acceptable piece of work were it not for the cumbersome English sentences which defy all attempts to parse them A splendid opportunity to offer a summary of our knowledge of the climate the structure of the ice the fauna and flora is simply anni hilated by such sentences as the following p 250 The nonmelting of the snow is of necessity accompanied by a change in its trans formation  Again scientific men do not usually speak of a species of animals being extirpated as they are said to be on pages 270 and 273 The maps and charts are however the re deeming features of the book They form a very interesting collection of illustrations and are worthy of a better fate than burial in such ponderous and heavy verbiage It is also to be regretted that in giving a list of books articles and maps upon this subject no attempt was made to make the list as nearly complete as possible In these days of careful bibliographical work the preparation of such a list would have been a comparatively easy task Furthermore a labor of this char acter would have been very much appreciated by the scientific world and it is a pity that it was not done By what has been said above it is not in tended to produce the impression that the book is without merits It will be a useful com pend for a person who desires to become ac quainted with the leading facts in connection with Antarctic investigations but it will never be a book of popular interest In the scientific summaries too little has been given to satisfy the scientific man and it is therefore evident that there is still an opportunity left for a book which will satisfy these conditions WILLIAM LIBBEY Physiology for the Laboratory By BERTHA MIL LARD BROWN Boston Ginn  Co 1900 Pp viii  167 A Syllabus of Elementary Physiology with Refer ences and Laboratory Exercises By ULYSSES O Cox Mankato Minn Free Press Print ing Co Pp viii  167 If one were to judge by the number of books on  Practical Physiology  that appear yearly it would seem that the longhopedfor day had come in which Physiology had become a labora tory study in all academic grades from the grammar school to the university Even if it fulfills the ideal of its author only each book in this field if well done is to be welcomed for it means at least an attempt in the right direction Of the two books now before us Miss Browns is the more modest In less than 150 pages there are given the essential experiments in a course in Vertebrate Physiology presumably for the high school or normal school A chap ter on the cell and one on the bacteria are added The matter is in large part purely physiological but the dissection of the various organs is included Vivisection is excluded ex cept the slight amount that is involved in a study of reflex action in the brainless frog The directions simply point the way and the chosen ground is well covered A few correc tions should be made The chromosomes are said to be scattered through the protoplasm  epidermis is the outer dead skin the ex panded portion of the external ear is misnamed the  concha while the reflex character of the kneejerk is settled by requiring the student to trace the course of the nerve impulse The book by Mr Cox consists of a syllabus with references to reading and a series of lab oratory exercises The syllabus is a detailed but crudely expressed classification of the con ventional subjectmatter of Physiology of which students could make little use The references are chiefly to wellknown American and English SCIENCE 683N S VOL XII No 305 textbooks most of which are good but some of which are sadly out of date The laboratory exercises partially cover the conventional ele mentary ground but are inferior to those of Miss Brown and of other authors Unfortu nately the book is marred by slovenly English colloquial expressions and typographical errors FREDERIC S LEE Physiology illustrated by Experiment By BUEL P COLTON Boston D C Heath  Co 1900 Pp xiii  386 This book is intended as a Briefer Course of Mr Coltons Physiology Experimental and Descriptive As an elementary textbook for secondary schools it can be recommended It contains an unusually large amount of matter concisely briefly and upon the whole at tractively presented It is preeminently phys iological and hygienic as distinguished from anatomical Its language is not overburdened with technicalities Its directions for practical work are limited but this is excusable in view of the many satisfactory laboratory books now in existence Most of its figures and diagrams are excellent The treatment of the subject of alcohol while fairly moderate as compared with that of some writers of textbooks is somewhat intemperate in its use of adjectives At the beginning of the chapter devoted to this subject the bald statement is made that  alcohol is not a food At the close of the chapter it is allowed on the authority of wellknown quoted writers that technically it may be called a food FREDERIC S LEE FOLKLORE IN BORNEO DR WILLIAM HENRY FURNESS 3d had pri vately printed an attractive little volume called Folklore in Borneo A Sketch in which is given a brief report of an ethnological field that has acquired a new interest because of the re cent discoveries made in the group of islands to which Borneo belongs The influence of a tropical environment is noted by the author in the Kayan myth of creation which he narrates as a purely Bornean product and contrasts it with the Dyak account of the genesis of the race wherein he discerns Malay influence Among the interesting pages of the book are those which tell of headhunting the one ruling passion of the people The tradition of its origin is given and the author thought fully remarks It is not unfair to infer from this tradition that they have a crude germinal sense of the barbarity of their actions in so far as they think it necessary to invent an excuse to palliate that savage love of trophyhunting which seems inborn in mankind And he points out how the native beliefs concerning the five peculiar regions in the land of de parted spirits tends to conserve the practice of the headhunting rite Among the many in teresting subjects touched upon are the con nection between the Pleiades and agriculture the omen birds and the devices the people practice to avert bad luck the function of fire as a gobetween of man and the birds and the glimpses of a river cult among these na tives The illustrations really illustrate the text they are admirably selected and the pictures of old and young men and women inspire confidence as types as they are without exaggerated peculiarities The book is a wel come addition to the literature of folklore A C F DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE NEWSPAPER SCIENCE To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE I have had so much satisfaction in the review and criticism recently published in SCIENCE of Mr Teslas magazine article on  Human Energy  that I can not avoid making public acknowledgment of my appreciation of its justice and timeliness especially the latter Is it not the imperative duty of men ofscience to do what the author of this review has done more frequently than they have during the past ten years  Within this decade there has been an enor mous decrease in the cost of publication and especially in the expense of illustration and this has brought about a deluge of reading matter of such infinite variety and general worthlessness that the formation of a society for its systematic suppression is worthy of seri ous consideration With the daily newspapers it has been distinctly an era of sensationalism A reporter for a daily paper recently de 684

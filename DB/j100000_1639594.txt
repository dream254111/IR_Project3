for his work in sanitation has died at Konigsberg in his seventyfifth year THE sequence of events so often observed in the history of goldmining camps has been re peated in the Willow Creek district Alaska The earliest prospectors in 1897 were pri marily interested in the search for placer gold and having found it were too busily engaged in mining to trace the stream gold to the veins from which it originally came It was nearly ten years later that the first of the valuable quartz veins that now yield most of the gold mined in the district was discovered Since 722 SCIENCESCIENCE 1906 however quartz mining has progressed steadily and has rested upon a substantial basis In 1913 the production of the district for the first time exceeded 100000 but in 1914 it was almost treble that amount Three mills are in operation and more will soon be installed With the increase in the depth of mining the veins show no diminution in the amount or tenor of the gold A study of the geologic conditions in this general area leads to the conclusion that veins similar to those now worked may be found beyond the borders of the present mining district and prospects already being developed confirm this conclu sion The district lies near the route of the government railroad from Seward to Fair banks and the cheaper transportation should greatly stimulate its development There is thus every indication that the Willow Creek district will steadily increase in importance as a goldmining camp and that it will have a long period of productiveness Since the dis tricts establishment as a gold quartz mining camp the gold placers which originally were regarded as the only valuable gold deposits have decreased in importance until their annual output is now small yet under the more favor able conditions of transportation soon to be realized it is possible that placer mining may again be profitably carried on A report on the Willow Creek district by S R Capps published as Bulletin 607 of the United States Geological Survey includes in addition to a description of the mines and prospects a dis cussion of the history geography and geol ogy of the district The report is illustrated by a topographic and a geologic map on a scale of about 1 inch to the mile and by nu merous photographs and textfigures A PHASE of the study of the underground waters of southern Louisiana is their utiliza tion in the cultivation of rice by irrigation In 1888 lowlands near the bayous suitable for growing sugar cane corn and cotton could be purchased for 350 an acre and the prairie lands back from the bayous could be bought for 1 an acre With almost the first crop under irrigation however the values showed a marked rise and have continued to increase In the first five years the value of the best rice 723 lands rose to 10 an acre and soon after that it rose to 30 and even 50 an acre The first people to plant rice in southern Louisiana ac cording to the United States Geological Survey were the Acadians who after their expulsion from Nova Scotia by the English in 1755 settled in considerable numbers in Loui siana Their cultivation of rice almost abso lutely primitive in its methods was confined to the lowlands along the bayous the prairies affording pasturage for the Acadians herds of cattle Few of the lowland areas admitted of satisfactory drainage and they were too small for profitable cultivation The crops fre quently failed in years of deficient rainfall Attempts were made to create additional water supplies by building levees across low sags or coulees at points higher than the cultivated areas but generally either the rainfall proved deficient or the reservoirs were too small Little advance was made over the Acadian methods until very recently Experiments in unusually wet years had shown that the soils of the prairies were adapted to the growth of rice if sufficient water was at hand This led to the trial of pumps as a means of raising water from the bayous to the rice fields So successful was the test that pumps were at once installed at many points and in a few years tens of thousands of acres of previously almost useless land lying 10 to 70 feet above the bayous were put under cultivation The first large pump was installed in 1894 on the Bayou Plaquemine in Acadia Parish near Crowley Although its failure at a critical time involved the partial loss of the crop it showed that rice could be cultivated by pump ing which has been gradually adopted on larger and larger scales until now in the larger plants batteries of pumps operated by com pound Corliss engines are in common use THE archeological work carried on in Mani toba for the Geological Survey Canada by Mr W B Nickerson has been completed for the season An artificial mound was found on the most conspicuous headland overlooking the Assiniboine River about six miles north of Alexander This Mr Nickerson explored and found to be a burial mound Among the finds were one hundred and sixtytwo marine shells NOVEMBER 19 1915N S VoL XLII No 1090 and six cylindrical objectsbeads or pend antsmade of the columella of the conch They indicate trade or expedition as far as the sea Two groups each of more than one hundred gravel mounds on terraces in the Assiniboine Valley were found to be of nat ural origin although resembling artificial burial mounds in appearance No mounds were found in the valley of the Little Sas katchewan and slight evidence of habitation Near Arden Mr Nickerson explored a long mound consisting of two domeshaped ends with a connecting grade and a broad dome shaped mound in which were found parts of three human skeletons a perforated disc made of shell and two objects made of bone prob ably used as bracelets A third mound within the village of Arden had been previously dis turbed Several camp sites were found at the foot of the Assiniboine Hills at springs form ing small streams also in the vicinity of Arden along the White Mud River Mr Nickerson took seventyfive photographic films in connection with this work and secured a number of gifts for the Dominion collections UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS As was noted in SCIENCE last week Co lumbia University received by the will of Amos F Eno the residuary estate It also re ceives a revisionary interest in certain be quests In addition the GeneralSociety of Mechanics and Tradesmen receives 1800000 and bequests of 250000 each are made to New York University The American Mu seum of Natural History the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Associa tion for Improving the Condition of the Poor MR AND MRS NORMAN W HARRIS of Chi cago have increased their gift of 25000 to Mount Holyoke College made at the time of the seventyfifth anniversary to 50000 for the endowment of the chair of zoology Mrs Harris is a graduate of the college of the class of 1870 THE date for the dedication of the new buildings of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been fixed by the executive committee of the corporation for June 14 1916 Practically all the stonework of the buildings has been completed and nearly all the carving which in addition to the decora tive features of capital cornice and portico will include the names of the founders of sci ence incised about the towers In the interior the floors are in process of finishing this be ing done by means of electric polishers which are carrying on the work at the rate of 2500 square feet a day The rough plumbing is practically all in place and the installation of fixtures is under way In ten of the build ings the steam heating system is ready and later this month when the boiler house is com pleted the buildings will be dried out by steam heat AT the University of Minnesota efforts are being made to bring faculty and regents into closer personal relations At a general as sembly of the whole teaching staff held Sep tember 27 ten of the twelve regents of the uni versity were present and made brief addresses The president of the board Mr Fred B Sny der emphasized the fact that the regents re garded the faculty members not as employees but as colleagues responsible for the really im portant work of the university He made an appeal for the hearty cooperation of all con cerned for the welfare of the institution On the evening of November 3 the new members of the faculty were invited to meet the regents at the house of the president of the university For December 14 a dinner is being arranged by a faculty committee On this occasion there will be an informal discussion in which it is expected that both faculty and regents will express their views about university ideals and policies PROFESSOR T W GALLOWAY PhD who has occupied the chair of biology at James Milli kin University at Decatur

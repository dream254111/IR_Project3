58 Pa St 333 347 Assuming the legislature to have the power to make a regulation in a given case the question arises as to whether the regulation is directory or mandatory that is whether the failure to carry it out will avoid the election or not If the regulation is directory the failure to observe it will not avoid the election if it is mandatory it will Thus in a recent case in Illinois the court was called upon to construe two statutory provisions one of which made it necessary that ballots be prepared within booths provided for that purpose and the other of which required an election judge to put his initials on the back of the ballot handed to the voter Choisser v York I904 7I N E 940 All the judges agreed that the first direction was mandatory but a difference of opinion prevailed as to the second The general inclina tion is to regard directions as directory where all has been done in good faith and the irregularities do not affect the result Collins v Huff 1879 63 Ga 207 Thus lack of qualification of election officers to hold their position Swepslon v Barion t882 39 Ark 549 or failure to certify the result in proper form Trimrmier v Bomar I883 20 S C 354 or failure to file an oath Trimmier v Bomar supra have not been held fatal Whatever involves the secrecy of the ballot is however usually regarded as mandatory The great desideratum of our method of voting is secrecy Cooley Const Limitations 6th ed  760 and whatever tends to impair it will be strictly scrutinized The view of the principal case that failure to vote within the booth provided invalidated the votes so cast is entirely in accord with the principle of keeping inviolate the secrecy of the ballot As to the construction of the second regulation here in ques tion the matter seems more difficult The legislature does not appear to have overstepped its power in making the regulation though the dissenting opinion looks to that view After adopting the opinion however that the legislature did not go beyond its legiti mate sphere it is doubtful at least whether the view of the court that the regulation was intended to be mandatory rather than directory is in accord with the weight of judicial opinion The statutory requirement that the election judge write his initials on the back of the ballot does not seem to go to root of anything sufficiently vital to necessitate construing the statute as mandatory See 3 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW 51 CONTRACTS TO GIVE SATISFACTIONWhere one contracts to do a certain thing to the satisfaction of another should he be prevented from recovering because of the unreasonable although bona fide dis satisfaction of that other  There seems to be no reason in the policy of the law why the parties to a contract should not agree that the decision of one of them or of a third party shall be conclusive as to performance The courts therefore should not hesitate to enforce such a contract and say that when a man contracts for an act that shall be satisfactory to himself it was never intended to mean an act satisfactory to another or to a jury It may be a perilous contract for a man to make but having voluntarily undertaken it the instru 56ment is to be interpreted in strict accordance with the intent of the parties as gathered from their expressions This logical view is fol lowed by the Iowa court in the recent case of Inman Mfg Co v American Cereal Co I 904 100oo N W 860 The decisions of the various jurisdictions on this point are con flicting The New York courts have practically gone the length of making contracts for the parties holding in a case where the pro duction of a certificate of the water purveyor was a condition prece dent to payment that It was necessary for the plaintiff eithtr to prove upon the trial the making of such certificate or to show that it was refused unreasonably and in bad faith It was unreasonable to refuse it if in contemplation of the contract it ought to have been given In such contemplation it ought thus to have been given when in very fact and beyond all pretence of dispute the state of things existed to which the water purveyor was to certify to wit the full completion of the contract in each and every one of its stipula tions Bowery Naf Bank v The Mayor etc 1875 63 N Y 336 The tendency to thus give arbitrary construction to a contract is particularly noticeable in cases like building contracts where labor or services have been rendered or materials supplied and the situation is such that there will be absolute loss to the plaintiff if the matter be left entirely to the decision of another Here the courts have gone great lengths in their efforts to accomplsh substantial justice sometimes holding that the presence of the words  in the best work manlike manner as in Doll vN oble 1889 i 6 N Y 230 or the mention of certain specific tests as in Hawkins v Graham i 889 149 Mass 284 indicated an intention to leave the final decision to the jury rather than to the judgment of the party contracting The New York rule touching this class of cases FOLGER J has summed up as follows That which the law shall say a contracting party ought in reason to be satisfied with that the law will say he is satisfied with City of Brooklyn v Brooklyn Cily R R Co  872 47 N Y 479 also Hummelv Stern 1895 36 N Y Supp 443 But while the New York rule allows the court to controvert the express provisions of the contract in order to work out justice to the man who has agreed to polish the wood work in Bs houses  in the best workmanlike manner and to Bs satisfaction Doll v Noble supra it refuses to take such a step in aid of the maker of a litho graphic design under similar conditions Gray v Alabama ANal Bank 1891 14 N Y Supp I55 which being one of the socalled class of contracts involving personal taste or individual preference is interpreted strictly and the parties credited with meaning what they said It is quite generally held that one agreeing to perform such services to the satisfaction of another has assumed the risk of losing his compensation by reason of the bona fide dissatisfaction of that other no matter how unreasonable it may be Such instances are the making of a suit of clothes Brown v Foster I873 113 Mass 136 the moulding of a bust Zaleskiv Clarke 1876 44 Conn 218 the painting of a picture Gibson v Cranage 1878 39 Mich 49 or the

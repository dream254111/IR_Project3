return obtains a contingent right to have something of greater value if an appeal to chance by lot or otherwise under the direction of the manager of the scheme should de cide in his favor BISHOP STAT CRIMES  952 See Equitable Loan  Security Co v Waring 117 Ga 599 44 S E 320 62 L R A 93 97 Am St Rep 177 And a gift enterprize may be defined as a scheme for the division or distribution of certain articles of property to be determined by chance among those who have taken shares in the scheme Lohman vState 81 Ind 15 City of Winston v Beeson 135 N C 271 47 S E 457 65 L R A 167 The weight of authority holds that there must be some valuable con sideration given for the right to a chance but that there need be no separate consideration for the chance itself Equitable Loan  Security Co v Waring supra See People v Elliott 74 Mich 264 41 N W 916 3 L R A 403 16 Am St Rep 640 But there seems to be no reported case in which it is held that the consideration must be paid in money Other cases are not so strict in their construction of what constitutes a lottery and hold that there must be some valuable consideration paid for the chance itself Yellowstone Kit v State 88 Ala 196 7 South 338 7 L R A 599 16 Am St Rep 38 It was held not to be illegal for a dealer to issue coupons of certain values to his customers entitling them to secure certain other articles in return for the coupons State v Shu gart 138 Ala 86 35 South 28 The methods used to evade the prohibition of lotteries and gift enter prises are very numerous and ingenious and hence most of the courts have become exceedingly strict in their construction of what constitutes a lottery State v Lipkin 169 N C 265 84 S E 340 L R A 1915F 1018 The ingredient of chance is what the law denounces and in order to eradicate this evil the courts will look to the substance rather than to the form of the scheme State v Lipkin supra So it has been held that where an article is sold upon the installment plan and certain prizes are offered to the lucky person the plan is a lottery even though by paying the remainder of the installments all purchasers may obtain the original article bargained for DeFlorin v State 121 Ga 593 49 S E 699 104 Am St Rep 177 State v Moren 48 Minn 555 51 N W 618 And where a dealer operated a slot machine which entitled a purchaser to win an article of value in addition to that which he bought this was held to constitute a lottery Meyer v State 112 Ga 20 37 S E 96 51 L R A 496 The principal case is an illustration of the extreme to which some courts will go for the result in this case would seem to de pend more on the industry of the contestants than on chance MARRIAGEANNULMENTPREGNANCY BY ANOTHERThe plaintiff was induced to marry the defendant upon her representation that she was pregnant by him Upon ascertaining that her condition was the result of previous improper relations with a third party the plaintiff sought to have the marriage annulled on the ground of fraud Held that such marriage cannot be annulled Safford v Safford Mass 113 N E 181 238RECENT DECISIONS Antenuptial pregnancy by another man if concealed from the hus band is a fraud upon him justifying a decree of divorce or annulment the remedy varying with the jurisdiction Carris v Carris 24 N J Eq 516 Reynolds v Reynolds 3 Allen Mass 605 But in support of the principal case the decisions almost uniformly hold that if the husband had been guilty of illicit intercourse with the wife before marriage and is induced to marry her by her representations that she is pregnant by him he can have no relief on account of her pregnancy by another man Foss v Foss 12 Allen Mass 26 States v States 37 N J Eq 195 See Scroggins v Scroggins 14 N C 535 Amendment is refused in such cases upon the ground that the husband has ample notice of his wifes weakness and is presumed to accept the consequences resulting from the assumption of the marital status under these conditions Seilheimer v Seilheimer 40 N J Eq 412 2 Atl 376 Franke v Franke Cal 31 Pac 570 18 L R A 375 Or that the plaintiff is estopped by his own mis conduct States v States suptra It is submitted that the requirements of law and utility are not always met by the constant application of these general doctrines for the reason that the facts of each case are peculiarly within the knowledge of the deceiving spouse and the misconduct of the plaintiff is unconnected with the matter in litigation 1 POMEROY EQ JUR 3 ed  399 But a distinction seems to have been made in certain cases rhere the child was already born and known to the wife to have neglo blood Barden v Barden 14 N C 548 Scott v Schufeld 5 Paige N Y 43 On principal it would seem that the existence or nonexistence of fraud deemed sufficient to constitute ground for relief should not be dependent upon any racial characteristic of the third party responsible for the wifes pregnancy Relief has been given in several recent cases upon the ground that at the time of entering the marriage state the wife was incapable of bear ing a legitimate child to her husband Sissung v Sissung 65 Mich 168 31 N W 770 And divorces were granted in several other recent cases solely upon the ground of fraud despite indulgence on the part of the husband in illicit prenuptial intercourse Lyman v Lyman Conn 97 Atl 312 See Wallace v Wallace 137 Ia 37 114 N W 527 These cases would seem to show an increasing tendency to relieve under such cir cumstances as show a bona fide attempt on the part of the plaintiff to make reparation for a moral wrong falsely represented by the defend ant to be the direct result of his misconduct The introduction of illegitimate children into the marital status offers another tangible ob jection to the general rule and it would seem that a more extensive application of the principals embodied in these later cases would in a great many instances more effectively subserve the interests of law and expediency As to fraudulent concealment of physical defects as grounds for annulment of marriage see 2 VA LAW REV 465 As to annulment of marriage on ground of fraud where the woman had previously borne an illegitimate child see

HIGH SCHOOL THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO By Members of the Department of Mathematics ERNST R BRESLICH RALEIGH SCHORLING HORACE C WRIGHT HARRY N IRWIN INTRODUCTION In the following course of study it is aimed so to reorganize the body of secondaryschool mathematics as to fit the subject effec tively to the needs of the students and to make it more productive for mental life and growth Since 1903 the departments of mathe matics of the University High School and the School of Education have been developing a solution of the problem of mathematical reorganization along the lines of correlation By the bringing together of subjects that are closely related each is reinforced by the aid of the others and the entire work in these subjects is unified and vitalized For example algebra and geometry supplement each other Both are used to express facts about quantity The formula and the graph are only different ways of expressing the law of a group of numerical facts Each states the facts in generalized form and thus makes the deduction of any number of particular cases possible Moreover when the two forms of thought are cor related in a single course of instruction the students comprehension of quantity is at the same time deepened and simplifieddeepened because of the more enduring impression made upon the mind simplified because the double method of attack makes it easier to overcome difficulties by supplying always a strategic alternative The student will see the advantages of having various modes of treating the facts of quantity Thus he is made to realize the value of algebra by seeing the superiority of algebraic methods in 648SECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL 649 important respects as compared with arithmetic and geometric methods When the various mathematical subjects are treated separately each tends to take on the rigid form of the final science This leads inevitably to a certain formalism in the mode of presentation Such formalism is not the best method for the highschool pupil Correlation helps to avoid excessive formalism Rigor is not carried beyond the understanding of the pupil Leading mathematicians and professors of the teaching of mathematics have long recognized the relationship between the various subjects of secondary mathematics especially algebra and geometry and have advocated the desirability of teaching them together The details of a plan for this correlation are being worked out in the University High School and the content of the firstyear course is now well organized and is given in FirstYear Mathematics a textbook published by the University of Chicago Press The secondyear course is contained in SecondYear Mathematics also published by the University of Chicago Press Work on the third and fourthyear courses is progressing and it is hoped to publish them in the near future AIMS AND VALUES Among the purposes of secondary mathematics the following are emphasized I A knowledge of the fundamental facts and principles of mathematics needed by students because of the correlation of these facts and principles with other studies such as science draw ing geography and arithmetic verification of the familiar geo metric formulas used in arithmetic and because of their usefulness in science astronomy physics chemistry geology economics all use mathematics engineering designing architecture navigation railroad building The best interest in mathematics cannot be secured without a considerable number of practical problems that come within the comprehension and observation of the ordinary pupil 2 Development of spatial and pictorial imagination ie the ability to visualize objects relations and conditions This train650 THE SCHOOL REVIEW ing which cannot be secured from other highschool subjects is a real need in life especially for those who cannot go beyond the high school 3 Development of functional intuition ie of the appreciation of the dependence of one magnitude upon another The pupil learns to attack new problems with the fertile question What relations are here involved  rather than the sterile  What is the unknown here  The existence of this dependence falls within the experience of every pupil 4 The disciplinary value eg training in accurate thought and power of concentration the acquisition of orderly habits of precise oral and neatly written expression and not at all the least of honesty ie of saying exactly what one means and meaning exactly what one says training in setting out to do a specific thing and doing precisely that thing ie training in the habit of making good The disciplinary value of mathematics always has been considered one of the principal values of mathematics 5 Improving the studyhabits of the student Since super vised study is easily introduced in mathematics this subject is especially valuable as a means of teaching students how to study FIRSTYEAR MATHEMATICS GENERAL STATEMENT In his elementary mathematics the student has learned to add subtract multiply and divide numbers and to use his knowledge of these operations in the solution of problems He has become acquainted with the common geometrical forms and many relations of geometrical magnitude In many respects algebra is like arith metic It consists of the study of the operations and is an effective tool for solving problems The study of algebra enables the student to get a better understanding of the principles underlying arith metic to express laws in brief form and to abbreviate the language in the solution of problems Hence in a first course in secondary mathematics the student should continue the study of numbers and extend his knowledge of the fundamental notions of geometry In planning the work of the year the following facts have been kept in mindSECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL 651 Each of the various divisions of secondary mathematicsarith metic algebra geometry and trigonometryincludes simple prin ciples relatively easy to master and also difficult complex principles The simple principles are best suited to beginners and may there fore be brought together in an introductory course which leads up to the more complex aspects of these various branches of mathe matical science When they make the acquaintance of only one subject in mathe matics during the first year many students fail to get an insight into secondary mathematics Discouraged by failure in one sub ject these pupils do not continue the study and thus they miss the opportunity to discover that they can be successful in another sub ject However in an introductory course in which algebra and geometry are taught together success in one field will arouse an interest and enthusiasm which will encourage the student to attack the other with increased vigor The result will be a gain in mathe matical power and no less in general training In the firstyear course geometry is used throughout to illustrate algebraic processes while algebra carries on the reasoning in the compact and abstract symbols which generalize quantitative facts to an extent which is impossible in graphic expression The fundamental notions of trigonometry which are commonly kept from the student until the third or fourth year of high school appeal to him because of their usefulness as tools in problemsolving Hence these notions are introduced at an early stage and they are so presented as to create no material difficulty for the beginner AIMS Ability to solve simple equations in one or more unknowns to solve quadratic equations in one unknown to maintain algebraic expressions and formulas and to represent given data in algebraic symbols To review clarify and develop informally the fundamental notions of geometry such as point line plane surface solid angle parallel lines etc and certain fundamental facts of geometry as equality of angles of linesegments congruence similarity and symmetry of figures Review of the formulas of geometry generally taught in arithmetic652 THE SCHOOL REVIEW Ability to represent numerical facts graphically To acquire general familiarity with the instruments used in geometry To remove the great difficulties found by students when taking up logical geometry by passing gradually and almost imperceptibly to the deductive method of demonstrative geometry METHODS Algebra is introduced as a natural means of expressing facts about number gradually becoming a symbolic language especially adapted to stating conditions of a problem in a natural and helpful way The growing difficulty and complexity of problems then lead to the necessity of learning how to manipulate algebraic sym bols and expressions and how to solve Algebraic equations The symbolism of algebra thus becomes a highly clarifying instrument of problemanalysis and problemsolving Strong emphasis is placed upon intuition observation descrip tion and motor control At first students are taught to measure to construct with rules and compass to recognize the fundamental forms of geometry in the classroom and elsewhere This suggests the geometric truths Concepts and facts discussed are first expressed in terms already familiar to the student then gradually translated into the precise language of geometry The fact that measurements are at best only approximate and are very tedious and difficult if carefully done gradually leads to a desire for better methods and to a need for the logical method In short these experiences motivate the logical procedure However attempts at lengthy formal demonstration are not made The method of proof is always informal its aim being to establish geometric facts and to prepare for not to develop skill in logical demonstration The laws of algebra are carefully illustrated and thus the stu dent is enabled to avoid the danger of symboljuggling without insight into the real meaning Certain processes which belong together logically are separated in treatment because they present real difficulties for the beginner Hence wherever the processes are not needed as instruments of instruction they are taught separately eg the meaning of positive and negative numbers theSECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL 653 laws of signs and the operations with positive and negative num bers are not studied until the pupil has become thoroughly

formula in terms of the others XIX REVIEW AND SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS TEXTBOOK Breslichs FirstYear Mathematics published by the University of Chicago Press is used in the firstyear course TIME REQUIRED OF STUDENTS Five onehour class periods a week throughout the school year are given to mathematics Probably an average of fifteen minutes of the period is used for supervised study where special attention is given to the individual differences existing among students An average of about fifteen minutes a day is expected for home work This work is generally of the same type as the work done in the classroom STANDARDS OF ATTAINMENT The student who expects to take only one year of mathematics in the high school has acquired a knowledge of such geometric facts as he is most likely to make use of in later life he knows enough algebra to prefer the algebraic method of solving problems to the less effective arithmetic method and he has had a good review of the fundamental processes with arithmetic numbers The student who expects to go on with the study of mathematics has laid a good foundation upon which to build the future work TYPE LESSONS I A lesson illustrating how to take up the study of the addition axiomsLinesegments are used to establish a concrete basis for this study The teacher draws on the blackboard two pairs of equal line segments as AB and CD and EF and GH Fig I see p 657 A student is then asked to draw on the board the sums of ABEF and CDGH Another student measures these sums and com pares them He finds that they are equalSECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL 657 The problem is then repeated in a somewhat different form Letting a b c and d be the lengths of four segments such that a b and cd show by measuring that acbd By means of these problems the student is led to state the addition axiom in his own A B C D E F G H FIG I words He finds in the textbook on the other hand a statement of the axiom with which to compare his own Equals added to equals give equals The second problem makes him familiar while he is learning the statement with the form in which this axiom is usually applied At the same time he is acquiring valuable training in the ability to measureso important for all graphical work II A lesson illustrating how abstract discussions are introduced with concrete illustrationsThe use of axioms in solving equations is preceded by the solving of equations by the aid of the balance In making a study of the equation we must begin with some very simple problems in order that we may clearly understand the new laws to be developed If these laws are mastered in connection with simple cases it will be easy to apply them later to more complicated and difficult cases Let us solve the follow ing problem A bag of grain of unknown weight w ounces together with an 8oz weight just balances an i8oz weight How much does the bag of grain weigh  The problem may be stated in an equa 8 tion thus  w8 18 Find w 0 Suppose 8 oz to be taken from each pan FIG 2 Fig 2 giving W 10 The bag of grain weighs io oz Showing w8 I8 At this point it is necessary to define two mathematical terms An equation as w8 i8 may be regarded as an expression of  FirstYear Mathematics p 17658 THE SCHOOL REVIEW balance between the numbers on the two sides of the equality sign The number to the left of the equality sign is the left side or left member of the equation the number to the right is the right side or right member Thus in the equation a5 7 a5 is the left member and 7 is the right member Several equations are now written on the blackboard and pupils state in words problems expressed by these equations These equations are then solved by the aid of the balance We shall now learn how to solve an equation without the use of the balance An equation as w8 i8 may be regarded as stating the question What number added to 8 gives 18  It has been shown that the answer may be found by interpreting the equation as a problem in weighing and then taking 8 oz from both pans of the balance Just as the scales will balance if the same number of weights are taken from each pan we may subtract the same number from both sides of an equation and get another equa tion The work of finding the unknown number this way may be arranged in written form thus Let w8 18 8 8 Then w  Io For if the same number be subtracted from equal numbers the remainders are equal subtraction axiom To test the correctness of the result replace the unknown num ber in the original equation by io obtaining io8 18 Since both members of the equation reduce to the same number the result w io is correct This is followed by solving a number of equations of the same type as above using the subtraction axiom III This lesson illustrates the experimental method in geome tryWe are to show that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 18o0 At first the truth of the theorem is shown by intuition as follows Draw a triangle Cut the triangle from the paper Tear off the corners and place the angles adjacent to each other Fig 3SECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL 659 What seems to be the sum of the angles of the triangle  The stu dent states that the sum is a straight angle or 18o0 The same fact is now shown in a different way That the sum of the angles of a triangle is 1800 can be shown by rotating a stick FIG 3 or a pencil successively through the angles as follows Draw a tri angle Place a pencil or stick in position i Fig 4 and note the direction in which it is pointing Rotate the pencil through angle x Then move it along AB to position 2 Turn the pencil through angle y and move it along BC to position 3 Turn it through angle z to position 4 The pencil has now rotated through an amount equal to xyz Note the direction in which the pencil is pointing in the last position Through what part of a complete turn has it rotated Through how many B right angles  Through how many degrees  i The student is now asked to express the new fact in algebraic symbols State by an X2 A Z c equation the number of degrees in the sum A s of the angles x y and z of a triangle FIG 4 By means of this equation it is possible to find an angle of a triangle when the other two are known This is of great importance eg it enables survey ors to find all angles of a triangle although they may be able to measure directly only two angles The new principle is now used in the solution of a number of problems In solving the next problems observe the following steps Make a sketch of the triangle denoting the angles as given in the problem To obtain the equation use the theorem that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180o Solve the equation and find the values of the angles Illustrative problem The difference between two angles of a triangle is 200 and the third angle is 360 Find the unknown angles66o THE SCHOOL REVIEW Let x be one of the angles Fig 5 Then x2o is the second angle The third angle is given equal to 36 Therefore xx2036 180o since the sum of the angles of any triangle is 1800 FIG 5 Solving for x we have x 62 x20 82 36 36 Check xx2036 i8o IV The following lesson illustrates the informal method of proof used in the later part of the course when a change is made from the experimental to the logical procedureIt is proposed to prove the following theorem The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular from the point to the line No attempt is made to observe the form used in demonstrative geometry ie to state first the hypothesis then the conclusion and finally the proof Instead the student begins at once to reason as follows Let AB be perpendicular to DE Fig 6 and let AC be any other line from A to DE Angle C in triangle ABC is acute for A if one angle of a triangle is 900 the other angles are less than 96o Therefore angle C must be less than B which is a right angle 6  It follows that AB is less than AC for FIG 6 if two angles of a triangle are unequal the sides opposite are unequal the greater side being opposite the greater angle V The following lesson shows how geometry is used to establish a concrete basis for abstract discussionsThe law of signs in multipli cation is taken up after the student has had a halfyears work in highschool mathematics It is approached by means of four problems as follows i Find the product of 4 by 3SECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL 661 Solution Since 34 is the same as 34 it follows that 34 equals 444 12 Geometri cally this means that to multiply 4 by 3 is to lay off 4 three times in its own direction Fig 7 Thus 34  12 I 13 zI I 13 I FIG 7 FIG 7 2 Find the product of 4 by 3 Solution Since 34 is the same as 34 34 444 12 Make a drawing for 34 ie lay off 4 three times in its own direction Thus 3 4  2 3 Find the product of 4 by 3 Solution Assuming that the commutative law holds for positive and negative numbers the student is familiar with this law then it follows that a 4 4 a  3 2 Notice that the same result is obtained by laying off 4 three times in the direction opposite to its own direction Make a draw ing for this product 4 Find the product of 4 by 3 According to problem 3 this means that 4 is to be laid off three times in the direction opposite to that of 4 Thus 34  12 Then from a study of the results of problems 14 the law of signs is deduced SECONDYEAR MATHEMATICS ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES The combined type of material of the mathematics of the first year is to be carried forward through the second year the emphasis being on geometry The operations and laws of arithmetic should be reviewed wher ever opportunity is offered and occasion warrants as in the evolution662 THE SCHOOL REVIEW of formulas in the introduction of new algebraic topics and in problems of computation The algebraic ground gained in the first year should be held and extended at least as far as is customary with the algebra before the third year The geometry should be largely of the demonstrative type The student should receive training in both plane and solid geometry Many theorems of solid geometry closely related to corresponding theorems irr plane geometry should be proved in the second year thus training the student in both two and three dimensional thinking The study of trigonometry begun in the first year is to be con tinued Trigonometric methods should often replace algebraic and geometric methods giving the student the opportunity to see some of the advantages of trigonometry over algebra and geometry AIMS AND VALUES To complete the study of plane geometry and algebra begun in the first year By this is meant to cover the essentials of what is commonly required of students in the first two years of secondary schools in this country To include in addition the elementary notions of trigonometry the application of three trigonometric functions sine cosine and tangent to the solution of the right triangle and to a number of practical problems the development of some of the fundamental relations between these functions the use of these functions in proving geometric theorems To begin and to make a real advance in the study of solid geometry before completing plane geometry This includes the theorems on lines and planes in space diedral angles areas of sur faces and volumes of solids omitting the discussions of polyedral angles and spherical polygons No topical treatment of the theory of limits is intended Such a treatment is not believed to belong to the early years of the high school course However the question of the existence of incom mensurable lines and numbers is raised examples of these are given and the notion of the limit of a sequence is developedSECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL 663 The material as arranged in this course opens to the student a broader richer a more useful and therefore more alluring field of ideas and lays a more stable foundation for future work than does any separate treatment A great saving of the students time is effected by developing arithmetic algebra geometry and trigo nometry side by side This also makes unnecessary the long and tiresome reviews usually given at the beginning of each subject replacing them by frequent incidental reviews leading immediately to an extension of the subject Often a highschool pupil fails rightly to esteem a highschool subject because he cannot discern its bearing on what has pre ceded and on what is to follow But having seen the closeness of the relation between the subjects he does not lose view of the familiar fields while at the same time he obtains an outlook into neighboring and more remote fields There is thus the economy resulting from accomplishing more work in less time and from the performance of tasks that are intelligently motivated METHODS In the firstyear course the student has gained a thorough understanding of the fundamental notions of geometry Hence in the second year somewhat formal methods are introduced from the start Even before this the advantage of the reasoning process over the process of measuring has been recognized Mathematical fallacies and optical deceptions are now used to make the need of a logical proof still more apparent To develop in the pupil a sort of geometrical strategy ie to attack to take possession and to exploit a geometrical problem methods of proof are discussed and emphasized not once for all but throughout the course To cultivate versatility and system students are taught to choose between various methods of proof and to follow some definite plan rather than to trust the chance of stumbling upon a proof Many model proofs are therefore given while in other proofs statements or reasons that should be apparent to the student are omitted with the purpose of making him inde pendent and of developing his powers of argumentation The old method of dividing the subject of geometry into a few books has been abandoned as being of only traditional value The664 THE SCHOOL REVIEW course is divided into a number of short chapters each dealing with one or a few central topics This arrangement is far better adapted to study by highschool students since the aims and purposes of the several chapters are easily seen It is more economical of the students time and energy than the old method Since the usefulness of a study is what always appeals most strongly to a beginner this phase is emphasized throughout the course The importance and the significance of geometrical facts in the affairs of everyday life are impressed upon the pupil The plan of introducing definitions whenever needed and not before which is used in the firstyear course has been followed also in the second year By the employment of algebraic notation and by the continued application of the equation to geometrical matters a firm hold is kept on algebra New algebraic topics are developed when oppor tunity and need arise Thus elimination by comparison and by substitution so frequently needed in proofs and in the solution of exercises is taught very early The solution of the quadratic equation by means of the formula the operations with fractions and factoring are all reviews or further extensions of topics whose study was begun in the first year A number of geometric proofs have been simplified by the use of trigonometry CONTENT I METHODS OF

used for supervised study An average of about thirty minutes a day is expected for home work TEXTBOOK Breslichs SecondYear Mathematics published by the Uni versity of Chicago Press is used in the secondyear course STANDARDS OF ATTAINMENT While in the preceding course geometric facts were established mainly by the inductive and the experimental methods the student now has learned to demonstrate the proofs of geometric facts and to attack the solution of problems and exercises by various methods He has completed the work that is usually given in a course in plane geometry In algebra he has had a review and extension of his knowledge of the solution of equations by various methods of factoring of frac tions and of quadratic equations He has covered what is ordi narily given in a oneyear course of algebra and some of the work is given in intermediate algebraSECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL 667 He has made a beginning of the study of trigonometry A large part of the solid geometry has been completed TYPE LESSON The following lesson illustrates the method of presenting a theorem in geometry in the secondyear courseIt is required to prove that if the alternate interior angles formed by two parallel lines and a transversal are equal the lines are parallel Several students are asked to state the theorem This is kept up until it becomes apparent that every member of the class has memorized the statement The class is then asked to think about the figure A few mo ments later a student is called upon to draw the figure on the black board Then the hypothesis is stated definitely with reference to the figure using the best symbolic notation Similarly the conclusion is obtained Even the poorest student in the class must be able to do the work up to this point Then follows the preliminary discussion analysis Q What are we to prove A AB I CD Q When are two lines parallel A number of theorems are suggested by the class and the following is selected as the most promising for our purpose Two lines are parallel if they are per pendicular to the same line This suggests drawing a helping line perpendicular to AB to prove that it is perpendicular to CD as HG Q When are two lines perpendicular  A If they are at right angles Q How may we prove angle G equal to a right angle  A By proving Z G Z H Q How may we prove two angles equal From a number of answers the congruent triangle method is selected Q Who can prove triangles HEM and FGM congruent  The proof is given by a student We now retrace the order of the steps in this analysis and obtain the proof After the proof is given the essential steps are empha sized and the theorem is assigned for review as home work668 THE SCHOOL REVIEW THIRDYEAR MATHEMATICS GENERAL STATEMENT The work of the third year is a continuation of the study of the topics given in the preceding years the emphasis being mainly on algebra and trigonometry AIMS During the second year the study of plane geometry has been completed During the third year the study of algebra and trigonometry is to be continued The work in solid geometry begun in the first year and continued in the second is to be completed in the third CONTENT AND METHODS A Equations I LINEAR EQUATIONS IN ONE UNKNOWN This work begins with verbal problems of a type more difficult than those of the first and second

process of the alge braic solution As in factoring the student learns that he cannot solve every system of the second degree in two unknowns and proceeds to study only certain type forms These forms suggest the method of solution Some of these methods are applied even to systems of higher degree than the second In connection with the computations arising in problems the use of tables slide rule and graphs is taught V EQUATIONS OF HIGHER DEGREE THAN THE SECOND The factoring method and the method of changing the equation into the form of a quadratic are used to solve the equations in this

years the student has accomplished the work usually given in three and onehalf years This is due mainly to the corre lation of the various subjects of mathematics to the reorganization of the material usually taught during the first three years and to the training obtained through supervised study FOURTHYEAR MATHEMATICS GENERAL STATEMENT The course centers around the notion of functionality It puts the emphasis upon the simple class of cases in which the functional dependence between the quantities involved may be expressed directly or indirectly by means of the fundamental operations The course parallels a similar course in college algebra given in the Junior College of the University AIMS AND METHODS The course is conducted informally with the aim of meeting the needs of a special group of students who intend to continue the study of mathematics or to prepare for the study of the sciences in the college With their future needs in mind emphasis is placed upon the fundamental functional relations the manipulation of formulas and the graphical interpretation of the functional relations This graphical treatment forms the introduction to the major topic namely the elementary discussion of the theory of equations The minor topics of the course such as series and determinants are treated to the extent justified by the ability and the interest of the particular class The emphasis is less upon formal requirements than upon voluntary contribution Frequently this takes the form of brief reports by the students to supplement topics previously treated in class Thus reports of Forsyths discussion of the solu tion of the general equation of the nth degree School Science and Mathematics December 1915 supplements the last presentation of Horners method of finding irrational roots of an equation In contrast to the earlier courses a maturer type of scholarship is demanded Many problems related to the topics treated areSECONDARY MATHEMATICS IN UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL 673 selected from other textbooks Supervised study is used exten sively Since the student has been trained in habits of study through the supervised study of the preceding courses he is able to work independently as soon as the theory of the particular lesson has been presented CONTENT I REVIEW AND FURTHER EXTENSION OF THE TOPICS OF PREVIOUS COURSES IN ALGEBRA I The laws of algebra commutative associative of exponents 2 The operations in complex problems 3 Functions 4 Equations of first second and higher degrees in one or more unknowns Difficult types of simultaneous quadratics Determinants Relations between roots and coefficients Theory of quadratic equations II THEORY OF EQUATIONS i All theorems leading up to and used in Horners method 2 Logical proofs of these theorems III SERIES i Binomial theorem for fractional negative exponents 2 Progressions 3 Convergent and divergent series 4 Undetermined coefficients 5 Permutations and combinations TIME REQUIRED OF STUDENTS Five onehour class periods a week during onehalf of the school year are given to this course The actual teaching time is approxi mately onehalf of the hour and seldom exceeds that time The required outside work is limited to thirtyfive minutes a day TEXTBOOKS AND REFERENCES The best textbook in college algebra available is used in this course During the last years Rietz and Crathornes College Algebra was used but the development paralleled that of Wilczynskis College Algebra The work is supplemented by reports on the ele mentary discussion of topics found in the journals of secondary school mathematics674 THE SCHOOL REVIEW STANDARDS OF ATTAINMENT During this course the method of instruction has aimed to develop mathematical power and a mathematical maturity neces sary for a successful pursuit of college mathematics The gap between secondary and college mathematics is thus minimized the student having learned to appreciate theory of a more difficult type than is ordinarily attempted in the high school PREPARATION FOR COLLEGEENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS A course of two periods a week for the first semester and three periods a week for the second semester is required of all Seniors during certification for admission to colleges which require mathe matics in the first year and of all candidates for recommendation for collegeentrance examinations Onehalf unit credit is given for this course Class periods are conducted entirely as supervised study periods no home work being required The work of the first two and onehalf years is summarized reviewed and extended

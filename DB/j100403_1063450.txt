J100403,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW,1063450,THE LIEN THEORY OF A MORTGAGE OR DEED OF TRUST,I243817,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW VIRGINIA SECTION THZ LIEN THEORY OF A MORTGAGE OR DEED OF TRUSTIT IS FAMILIAR LEARNING THAT ON EXECUTION OF A MORTGAGE OR DEED OF TRUST THE LEGAL TITLE TO THE RES VESTS IN THE MORTGAGEE OR TRUSTEE THE EQUITABLE TITLE ALONE REMAINING IN THE MORTGAGOR OR DEBTORGRANTOR THIS SITUATION HOWEVER HAS BEEN LOST SIGHT OF IN MANY OF THE STATESPARTICULARLY OF THE WESTAND SAVE AS AGAINST THE MORT GAGEE HIMSELF THE LEGAL TITLE IS REGARDED AS REMAINING IN THE MORT GAGOR IN SHORT THE MORTGAGE IS TREATED AS A MERE LIEN ON THE ES TATE EVEN AT LAWTHUS BORROWING THE EQUITABLE THEORY OF A MORT GAGE1 IN VIRGINIA THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LEGAL TITLE OF THE MORT GAGEE AND THE EQUITABLE TITLE OF THE MORTGAGOROR WHAT IS THE SAME THING BETWEEN THE EQUITABLE TITLE OF THE GRANTOR AND THE LEGAL TITLE OF THE TRUSTEE IN A DEED OF TRUST TO SECURE DEBTSHAS BEEN SHARPLY MAINTAINED2 BUT IN THE MORE RECENT CASE OF GRAVATT V LANE3 THE VIRGINIA COURT HAS ADOPTED INADVERTENTLY AS IS BELIEVED THE LIEN THEORY OF THE MORTGAGE IN HOLDING THAT AN OUTSTANDING DEED OF TRUST UNSATISFIED OFFERS NO IMPEDIMENT TO THE MAINTENANCE OF EJECTMENT BY THE DEBTORGRANTOR AGAINST AN ADVERSE TENANT THE VIRGINIA CASE CITED AS AUTHORITY 4 WAS THE CASE OF A SATISFIED TRUSTA WHOLLY DIFFERENT SITUATION IT IS AN ACCEPTED THEORY THAT AN ACTION OF EJECTMENT BY THE FORMER HOLDER OF THE LEGAL TITLE MAY NOT BE DE FEATED BY PROOF OF AN OUTSTANDING SATISFIED TRUST5 BUT IN THE CASE UNDER CRITICISM THE TRUST WAS AN UNSATISFIED ONE SHOULD THE TRUSTEE OF THE UNSATISFIED TRUST NOW BRING EJECTMENT AGAINST THE PREVAILING PLAINTIFF THE COURT WOULD BE DRIVEN TO HOLD THAT THE TRUSTEE COULD NOT RECOVER IN SPITE OF HISTORICAL ANALOGIES IN VIR GINIA AND OF THE IMPLICATION OF VA CODE 1919  5472 THAT IN SUCH CASE THE TRUSTEE OF A SATISFIED TRUST SHALL NOT RECOVER IN EJECTMENT AGAINST THE MORTGAGOR OR GRANTOR THE LIEN THEORY OF A MORTGAGE OR DEED OF TRUST IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ORIGINATED IN THE SOCALLED CODE STATES WHERE THE QUESTION L MR POMEROYS TREATMENT OF THE VARYING CONCEPTIONS OF A MORTGAGE IN THE SEVERAL STATES IS

CONSEQUENCE BUT THE QUESTION IS A VITAL ONE IN THOSE STATES AS IN VIRGINIA WHERE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAW AND EQUITY AND LEGAL AND EQUITABLE TITLES HAS BEEN RIGIDLY MAINTAINED FROM EARLIEST TIMES SEE THE MORE RECENT CASE OF GRIZZLE V FLETCHER WHERE THE VIR GINIA COURT HELD THAT THE EQUITABLE OWNER AND THE MORTGAGOR OR GRANTOR IN AN UNSATISFIED MORTGAGE IS BUT EQUITABLE OWNER OF AN INSURANCE POLICY COULD NOT MAINTAIN AN ACTION AT LAW THEREON BE CAUSE OF HIS MERELY EQUITABLE TITLEA HIGHLY TECHNICAL BUT QUITE SOUND RULING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE LEGAL TITLE THEORY AND THE LIEN THEORY IN THE CASE OF OUTSTANDING UNSATISFIED MORTGAGES AND DEEDS OF TRUST IS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN ACTIONS ON THE CASE AT LAW FOR TORTIOUS INJURY TO THE MORTGAGED PROPERTY IF IN VIRGINIA FOR EXAMPLE THE MORTGAGOR OR GRANTORDEBTOR IN A DEED OF TRUST MAY MAINTAIN AN ACTION AT LAW AGAINST A RAILWAY COMPANY FOR THE BURN ING OF FENCES OR HOUSES OR FORESTS ON THE MORTGAGED ESTATE WHAT DEFENCE MAY THE RAILWAY COMPANY MAKE WHEN THE MORTGAGEE OR TRUSTEE LATER INSTITUTES HIS ACTION FOR DAMAGES FOR THE SAME INJURY STANDING ON HIS OWN LEGAL TITLE THIS QUESTION BECOMES ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT WHERE THE INJURY DONE REDUCES THE VALUE OF THE SECURITY TO A POINT BELOW THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT SECURED ON THE WHOLE THIS DEPARTURE FROM ANCIENT LANDMARKS IS TO BE DEPRECATED AS LIKELY TOOPEN THE DOOR TO INNUMERABLE DIFFICULTIES IN THE FUTURE PRACTICAL AS WELL AS THEORETICAL TO ILLUSTRATE A EXE CUTES TO T A DEED OF TRUST ON HIS HOUSE AND LOT TO SECURE B 20 000THE HOUSE WORTH 15000 AND THE LOT 10000 BY THE NEGLI GENCE OF X THE HOUSE IS DESTROYED BY AN EXPLOSION WHO UNDER THE DOCTRINE OF GRAVATT V LANE MAY SUE AT LAW FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HOUSE IF THE DEBTOR MAY SUE AND RECOVER THE FULL AMOUNT OF DAMAGES SUFFERED THE CREDITORS RIGHTS ARE SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE TRUSTEE IS THE PROPER PLAINTIFF THE RIGHTS OF ALL PARTIES ARE PROPERLY PROTECTED AND ANCIENT LANDMARKS OF THE LAW ARE PRESERVED HOW MAY WE RECONCILE THIS CONCLUSION WITH GRAVATT V LANE W M LILT ACCESSARIES WHEN AND WHERE TRIED HOW INDICTEDSEC TION 4766 CODE 1919 PROVIDES THAT AN ACCESSARY EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE FACT MAY WHETHER THE PRINCIPAL FELON BE CONVICTED OR NOT OR BE AMENABLE TO JUSTICE OR NOT BE INDICTED CONVICTED AND PUNISHED IN THE COUNTY OR CORPORATION IN WHICH HE BECAME ACCESSARY OR IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL FELON MIGHT BE INDICTED ANY SUCH ACCESSARY BEFORE THE FACT MAY BE INDICTED EITHER WITH SUCH PRINCIPAL OR SEPA RATELY ITALICS OURS 127 VA 663 1920 225

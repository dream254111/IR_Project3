Surveys  Professor Sears November 17 Gypsy and Browntail Moths Professor Bruner December 1 Germination of Forest Seed  Mr MeNeel December 15 Forest Methods in the Rockies H Stephenson and H Greenamyre January 6 Problems in Forest Ecology Mr Pool AT the recent meeting of the British Iron and Steel Institute Professor E D Campbell of the University of Michigan presented a paper on the constitution of carbon steels According to an abstract in Nature he re viewed the efforts that have been made to interpret the phenomena of the hardening and tempering of steel in the light of the phase rule The analysis of the carbides obtained from martensite and from troostite in his laboratory appears to indicate marked disso ciation ionic as well as molecular in the carbides from martensite while the analysis of the carbides obtained from troostite would seem to indicate almost complete association and polymerization of the dissolved carbides since the nitroderivatives of the troostitic carbides are as dark in color as those obtained from equal amount of carbides derived from pearline These results would indicate the probability that when martensite is heated from 0 C to 200 C there is progressive as sociation of ionically dissociated carbides and polymerization of the carbides of lower molec ular weight into those of high molecular weight This polymerization of dissolved carbides is apparently complete by the time 604 SCIENCEOCTOBER 30 1908 the metal has been converted into troostite This conception of the changes which take place in the gradual conversion of martensite into troostite offers a simple and rational ex planation of the progressive darkening of martensite with rising temperature from 0 C to 200 C and for the increase of what Heyn and Bauer term free carbon but which is probably a condensation product of olefines of high molecular weight It is suggested that there does not seem to be any inherent reason why the complete substitution of hydrogen by iron should prevent carbon atoms from as suming relations to each other similar to those which they hold in hydrocarbons The conception of the carbon compounds of iron as metallic derivatives of hydrocarbons sug gests a possible explanation of many unsolved problems in the metallurgy of steel as for instance how other elements too small in amount in themselves to affect profoundly the properties of the steel may enter into the carbon compounds and by altering their con stitution bring about effects on the steel as a whole entirely out of proportion to the amount of the element present AT a convention at the University of Illinois to consider means of combatting tuberculosis in cattle in session on October 13 and 14 the methods followed successfully by the college of agriculture of the University of Wisconsin will be discussed with a view to adopting them in the state of Illinois The prevalence of the disease in Illinois is be lieved to be as great as it was in Wisconsin several years ago when the present plan of testing all dairy herds and segregating or de stroying the tuberculous was adopted Dean H L Russell of the Wisconsin Agricultural College delivered a lecture and postmortem demonstration of the effects of the disease upon cattle WE learn from the London Times that with the view of increasing the public utility of the collection of specimens contained in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons the council of the college has arranged for a series of demonstrations to be given in the theater of the college during the present session The demonstrations will be given by the conservator Professor Keith and by the pathological curator Professor Shattock Specimens from the museum will be shown and their bearings on general and surgical pathology discussed The demonstrations be sides being of practical value to medical prac titioners and advanced students should also be of assistance to visitors of the college museum The first demonstration of the series was to be given by Professor Keith on October 16 which is the one hundred and fifteenth anniversary of the death of John Hunter the founder of the musetm THE program of the Harvey Society for its course of lectures during the winter of 19089 is as follows October 24 Intestinal Infection and Immunity in Tuberculosis Professor A Calmette di rector of the Pasteur Institute

in the Journal of the American Medical Association the second meeting of the International Association of Medical Museums was held in Washington October 1 and 2 Dr William G MacCallum Baltimore was elected president Dr Sims SCIENCE 605N S VOL XXVIII No 722 Woodhead Cambridge vicepresident and Dr Maud E Abbott Montreal secretary treasurer It was decided to publish a bul letin and an editorial committee consisting of Drs Aldred S Warthin Ann Arbor Mich Dr Aschhoff Freiburg Germany and Dr Frederick F Russell Washington with the president and secretary exofficio was ap pointed Among the subjects discussed at the meeting were The Exchange of Specimens Elevation of the Medical Museum as a Teaching Medium Index Pathologicus Classification of Specimens and IMethods of Technic The next meeting of the asso ciation will be held in Boston in April next following the meeting of the Association of American Pathologists and Bacteriologists ALONG the lines of the Erie Railroad in western New York a train will be run this fall by the New York State College of Agri culture at Cornell The train will be known as the  Educational Special On board will be about a dozen senior members of the agri cultural faculty At each station where a stop of fortyfive minutes will be made the pro fessors will talk to the farmers and answer any questions that may be asked by seekers for information about improved methods of farming Circulars and posters will be sent in advance so that the exact time of the ar rival of the train may be known Towns on the main line the Rochester division and the Hornell and Attica division and their branches will probably be visited and the party will be on the road about ten days As a result of recent cooperative work with the state board of health of Rhode Island the United States Geological Survey has accumu lated a large amount of data in regard to textile and other factory wastes the processes which produce them their effects on streams into which they may flow and methods by which their deleterious effects may be reduced to a minimum This information will soon be made available to the general public through the medium of one of the surveys watersupply papers The factory wastes studied in detail are those resulting from wool scouring cottonyarn bleaching cottonyarn dyeing and cottoncloth bleaching and from the manufacture of fertilizer glue and oleo margarine Experimental purification of the wastes was undertaken with varying results The details of the experiments with esti mates of probable cost and degree of purifica tion will be given in full in the forthcoming paper It was found that all the wastes studied can be satisfactorily purified at a reasonable expense The sewage from the manufacture of fertilizer glue and oleo margarine contains enough valuable matter to pay the costs of treatment and the recovery of wool fat and potash from woolscouring liquor will in many cases result in a sub stantial profit The pollution of streams and consequent destruction of natural water re sources by such liquid wastes therefore seems to be unwarranted UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS A BILL has been introduced in the Vermont legislature appropriating 6000 annually for the establishment of a department of pedagogy in Middlebury College PaOFEssoR LIVEING has given to Cambridge University almost the whole of the apparatus and material belonging to him in the chemical laboratory THE attendance at the University of Cin cinnati this year exclusive of the external students is as follows liberal arts 409 engi

establishment and main tenance of agricultural schools of secondary grade in each supreme court district of the state two schools have been established this year one known as the Murray State School of Agriculture located at Tishomingo in Johnston County and the other at Warner in lMuskogee County These state schools will offer no courses of instruction other than in dustrial courses Each school has an appro priation for the first year of 20000 for build ings and 12000 for maintenance One fourth of the maintenance fund for each school must 606 SCIENCE

of sulphate of copper bluestone or with one of the preparations in which it is the important ingredient known as eau celeste Bordeaux mixture etc It seems very possible too that plants may be fortified against the attacks of parasitic fungi or their susceptibility to such attacks be largely diminished by special fertilization for the purpose of introducing into the plant substances which while not interfering with its growth shall make it a less congenial soil for the growth of fungi The line of investigation here suggested has not yet been followed out although it offers an opportunity for chemicophysiological Work which may yield important results It is obvious also that a vigorously healthy plant will resist the fatal influence of parasites far better than a poorly nourished one Much may be done after a plant is too far gone to be saved to prevent further spread of the disease by removing and destroying the diseased parts It is not sufficient however to throw the por tions removed into the rubbishheap the spores must be actually 363 A NEW RECORDING PRESSUREGAUGE1 IN designing the recording pressuregauge herewith illustrated the object was to produce an instrument which would be funda mentally simple and consequently reliable and which could be placed upon the market at a moderate cost Fig I represents the instrument complete and ready for appli cation Fig 2 shows the pressuretube with the inkingpointer attached the front of the case dial and cover of clock being removed The pressuretube A is of flattened crosssection and bent into approximately a sinusoidal form A flexible strip B of the same metal as the tube is secured at the ends and along the bends as shown in Fig 2 The bent tube may be considered as a series of Bourdon springs placed end to end Pressure applied to the tube produces a tendency to straighten each bend or collectively to elongate the whole This tendency to lengthen the tube is resisted by the flexible strip B and thereby converted into a multiplied lateral motion The inkingpointer is attached directly to the end of the pressuretube as shown in Fig   FIG 2 destroyed and this can be effectually done only by burning A 2 from which it will be seen that the usual mechanism and multi considerable number of fungi produce in the plants on which they plyingdevices are dispensed with since the motion of

at Stevens Institute and have given perfectly satisfactory results In regard to making the tubes alike it will be well to state that there has been no difficulty in producing a number in which the deflections were equal for equal pressures and which have been directly applied to a standard chart without adjustment It will be readily seen that in case there should be slight differences in the deflections such differences may be allowed for by raising or lowering the tube with reference to the dial This is equivalent to shortening or lengthening the deflections along the radial arcs For an indicating instrument it is only necessary to provide a graduated arc for the end of the tube to move over It is evident that the instrument is adapted for a vacuum as well as for a pressuregauge and it naturally follows that if sufficiently sensitive it will serve as a barometer and measure changes of at mospheric pressure The model herewith exhibited for this purpose was made by electrodeposition of nickel upon a piece of solder of the proper form the solder being afterward melted out in oil The walls of this tube are WO of an inch thick When this tube is exhausted of air and sealed as shown it gives a deflection of about three inches and a half for an external change of pressure of one atmos phere Another application of the pressure tube is in the recording thermometer The tube may be filled with a very expansible liquid such as alcohol and sealed Variations in temperature produce expansion of the enclosed liquid which in turn gives de flections of the tube to correspond These deflections may be used to record directly without multiplyingdevices as shown in one of the models The tubes of the pressuregauges to be inspected have been made by the writer at Stevens Institute for the purpose of thor oughly testing the novel form The results have been perfectly satisfactory and our recent experience in manufacturing has de monstrated the possibility of duplicating the tubes in quantities for a standard chart NOTES OF TOMATOES PERHAPS the most frequent and noteworthy observation made upon the culture of the tomato during several years of experi mentation with the plant at the Cornell Agricultural Station has been the great increase in vigor and productiveness which comes from careful handling and good tillage It often appears as if this vigor is not only characteristic of the immediate generation but that it is hereditary for a time to a profitable degree Handling or transplanting of young plants when frequently and properly done is invaluable and so far as the plant is concerned three or four transplantings are better than one In the station work in order to get the greatest results from tests the plants are handled in pots preferably rosepots and are transplanted several times The handling is expeditious and is not too expensive for the use of any one who grows tomatoes for home use For market culture they find that two transplantings are usually profitable Stocky plants vigorous and growing rapidly are better than simply early plants however and frequency of transplanting must not be con founded with early sowing and consequent necessity for several shiftings Tomatoplants or any plants in fact should not be shifted for the simple purpose of preventing crowding or draw ing Transplanting serves the purpose of maintaining a steady and symmetrical growth and it should occur before the plant be comes checked from neglect A good tomatoplant at the time of setting in the field is one which is stocky enough to hold the weight of the earth and pot when a number of plants are grasped in the hand by their tops and are carried along the rows They require no staking when set A tall and weak plant with a blos som on the top is not considered worth setting It is a common mistake to set tomatoplants in the field too early Cold nights even though several degrees above frost check the plants some times seriously How early the plants should be started for profit is a question which demands attention A few writers have maintained of late that nothing is gained in earliness and productiveness by early starting under glass This is undoubtedly true if the early plants NCE VOL XIV No 356 are not well grown but the Cornell experience is quite to the con trary with stocky and vigorous plants Whether this increase is worth what it costs is a question which must be answered by every grower for himself In every instance the earlysown plants gave earlier fruits than the others and in every case but one in which the yields were practically the same the total yield is much greater The gain in earliness sometimes amounts to three or even four weeks The dis advantage of very late planting middle of May is particularly pro nounced in the results at Cornell especially in point of productive ness This productiveness however is really a measure of earli ness inasmuch as it simply records the weight of fruit which had ripened up to Oct 10 when the tomato season was closed by frost Could the season have been sufficiently extended no doubt the ultimate productiveness of the varions plantings would have been the same It is a common notion that soils containing little or no manure are preferable to wellenriched soils for tomatogrowing It is supposed that rich soils tend to make vine at the expense of fruit causing lateness of maturity and consequent lessening of yield and the supposition is prevalent that rich soils tend to make fruits rougher or more irregular in shape A careful test upon these points has been made during the past season at Cornell with the result that heavy manuring for tomatoes may give decided benefits yet it is possible that the character of the soil or season may have much to do with the behavior of the plants under these conditions The manuring of one plat was excessive but the gain due to the very heavy dressing was not sufficient to pay for the extra cost But if excessive manuring did not greatly increase yield neither did it always tend to an unprofitable production of vine at the ex pense of yield and earliness as is commonly supposed The tomato is one of the most variable and inconstant of kitchen garden plants As a rule varieties differ but slightly from their allies and a considerable plantation and a critical eye are needed to determine many of even the common sorts It is certainly true that at least half of the varieties which have been offered in the last few years are practically the same as other varieties Varieties of tomatoes are as a rule shortlived Ten years may be considered the average profitable life of a variety and many sorts break up and disappear in two or three years This incon stancy of type is largely due no doubt to the haste with which new sorts are put upon the market The demand in tomatoes now calls for fruits which are regular in shape solid large and plants which are productive The old angular sorts are rapidly disappearing in commercial practice There has been no gain in earliness for the species for many years if at all and little if any need be expected The cherry and plum sorts with a few of the angularfruited and wrinkledleaved varieties are still the earliest sorts Yet comparative earliness be tween commercial varieties is an important consideration There is also no gain in capability to resist rot the cherry plum and angular sorts are still most exempt the cherry and plum varieties entirely so An experiment was undertaken to determine if keeping qualities are correlated with solidity Representative samples of many varieties taken so far as possible in the same stage of maturity were placed together upon a forcinghouse table and the fruits were removed as soon as they began to decay It was found that some of the frailest varieties kept the longest It appears there fore that solidity must be measured by a general judgment rather than by any definite expression This conclusion is quite at vari ance with common opinion Much has been said concerning the superiority of certain varie ties for cooking purposes aside from quality of fruit There is said to be characteristic differences between varieties in time of cooking and amount of shrinkage A painstaking cooking test was made with a few varieties but the results are so variable as to appear to be merely accidental or characteristic of individual fruits The fruits were cut into thin slices and placed in boiling water The shrinkages in weight and bulk do not appear to be correlated In some instances shrinkage was slight while in other varieties equally as solid and good it was great

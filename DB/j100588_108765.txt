J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108765,ON THE ELECTRIC CONDUCTING POWER OF ALLOYS,I207015, 161  X ON THE ELECTRIC CONDUCTING POWER OF ALLOYS BY A MATTHIESSEN PHD COMMUNICATED BY PROFESSOR WHEATSTONE RECEIVED NOVEMBER 17READ DECEMBER 22 1859 THE METHOD EMPLOYED FOR THE FOLLOWING DETERMINATIONS IS DESCRIBED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE FEBRUARY 1857 THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN WERE THE FOLLOWING 1 ALMOST ALL THE WIRES WERE DETERMINED IN NAPHTHA ROCKOIL AND THE TEMPERATURE OBSERVED 2 THEY WERE ALL SOLDERED TO TWO THICK COPPER WIRES WHOSE RESISTANCES WERE KNOWN AND BROUGHT INTO THE CALCULATIONS 3 TWO SEPARATE WIRES OF EACH ALLOY OF DIFFERENT DIAMETERS WERE GENERALLY PRESSED OR DRAWN AS IT WAS THOUGHT POSSIBLE THAT IN PRESSING OUT THE WIRES THEY MIGHT CONTAIN ALLOYS OF DIFFERENT COMPOSITIONS AS FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE AMALGAMS ARE PRESSED WE FIND THAT AT FIRST ALMOST PURE MERCURY COMES OUT OF THE SMALL HOLE AND TWO DETERMINATIONS WERE MADE WITH WIRES CUT FROM THE FIRST AND A THIRD FROM THE SECOND WIRE 4 THE HIGHER BISMUTH ALLOYS WERE PRESSED IN VERY FINE WIRES ABOUT 02 MILLIM DIAMETER IN ORDER TO OBTAIN CONCORDANT RESULTS 5 THE DIAMETERS OF THE WIRES WERE MEASURED AT EACH END AND GENERALLY ALSO IN THE MIDDLE PIECES OF THE WIRE AFTER THE RESISTANCE HAD BEEN DETERMINED BEING BENT AT THE ENDS SO THAT THEY WERE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE INTERMEDIATE PORTION OF THE WIRE IN ORDER THAT THE DIAMETER MIGHT BE MEASURED IN TWO DIRECTIONS WHICH ARE ALSO AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH EACH OTHER BY LAYING THE WIRE WITH ITS TWO ENDS VERTICAL IN SUCCESSION THE BRITTLE WIRES WERE BROKEN IN SHORT LENGTHS A NUMBER OF THEM MEASURED AND THE MEAN TAKEN OF THE VALUES SO FOUND 6 A NUMBER OF NORMAL WIRES OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS WERE USED SO THAT WHEN THE RESIST ANCES WERE GREAT EQUALLY ACCURATE RESULTS COULD BE OBTAINED 7 THOSE BISMUTHALLOYS WHICH EXPAND ON COOLING SO MUCH THAT THE LIQUID METALS BREAK THROUGH THE CRUST AND FORM GLOBULES ON THE SURFACE WERE RECAST IN SMALL PIECES SO THAT ONE WHOLE PIECE WAS USED FOR PRESSING THE WIRE FOR IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE GLOBULES WHICH FORM ON THE SURFACE HAVE A DIFFERENT CONTMPOSITION FROM THE PART WHICH FIRST SOLIDIFIES ALL THE WIRES WHICH WERE NOT PRESSED WERE HARD DRAWN AND THEY WERE COMPARED WITH A HARD DRAWN PURE SILVER WIRE WHOSE CONDUCTING POWER TAKEN AT 0T 100 TO SAVE SPACE ONLY THE MEAN OF THE THREE DETERMINATIONS WILL BE GIVEN THE BISMUTHTIN SERIES HOWEVER IS GIVEN IN FULL AND SERVES AS A FAIR SPECIMEN OF THE ACCURACY OF THE EXPERIMENTS AND WHEN NO CONCORDANT RESULTS COULD BE OBTAINED A MARK  WILL BE  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1858 T ALL THE TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE CENTIGRADE SCALE MDCCCLX ZDR A MATTHIESSEN ON THE ELECTRIC PUT TO THE ALLOY AND THE VALUE FOR ITS CONDUCTING POWER IS THE MEAN OF SEVERAL DETER MINATIONS A GREATER ACCURACY THAN THAT WHICH HAS BEEN OBTAINED COULD NOT BE EXPECTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTY OF PRESSING OR DRAWING A WIRE PERFECTLY ROUND

OF BISMUTH WITH SILVER BISMUTH HOWEVER BETTER RESULTS WERE OBTAINED THE BISMUTHANTIMONY ALLOYS WERE DETER MINED BUT AS NO CONCORDANT RESULTS WERE OBTAINED THEY WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE CURVE HOWEVER APPEARED TO BE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THIS CLASS ON LOOKING AT THE GOLDSILVER ALLOYS WE FIND THAT AU AG CONDUCTS 1459 AU AG AND AG2 AU CONDUCT RESPECTIVELY 1620 AND 1630 AU4 AG AND AG4 AU CONDUCT RESPECTIVELY 2091 AND 2094 AU6 AG AND AG6 AU CONDUCT RESPECTIVELY 24 99 AND 25 29 AND FROM THESE POINTS THE DIFFERENCE BECOMES GREATER AS WE APPROACH THE PURE METALS BUT AS 1 EQUIVALENT OF GOLD 19725 10226 VOLUMES AND 1 EQUIVALENT OF SILVER 108 YO68 10317 VOLUMES WE MAY REGARD THE ALLOY AU AG AS BEING COMPOSED OF 1 VO LUME OF GOLDL VOLUME OF SILVER AND WITHIN THE ABOVE LIMITS WE MAY ADD TO THE ALLOY AU AG EQUAL AMOUNTS OF GOLD OR SILVER AND OBTAIN THE SAME CONDUCTING POWER SHOWING THAT GOLD AND SILVER WITHIN THESE LIMITS WHEN ALLOYED WITH ONE ANOTHER HAVE THE SAME CONDUCTING POWER THE SAME REMARKS HOLD GOOD FOR SOME GOLD AND COPPER ALLOYS THE CURVES OF THE ALLOYS OF THIS CLASS SHOW THAT THERE IS A RAPID DECREMENT ON BOTH SIDES OF WHICH I SHALL SPEAK SHORTLY 170CONDUCTING POWER OF ALLOYS 5 GENERAL CONCLUSIONS THE QUESTION NOW ARISES WHAT ARE ALLOYS 1 ARE THEY CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS OR A SOLU TION OF ONE METAL IN ANOTHER OR MECHANICAL MIXTURES 1 AND TO WHAT IS THE RAPID DECRE MENT IN THE CONDUCTING POWER IN MANY CASES DUE T TO THE FIRST OF THESE QUESTIONS I THINK WE MAY ANSWER THAT MOST ALLOYS ARE MERELY A SOLUTION OF THE ONE METAL IN THE OTHER THAT ONLY IN A FEW CASES WE MAY ASSUME CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME OF THE GOLDTIN AND GOLDLEAD ALLOYS AND WE MAY REGARD AS MECHANICAL MIXTURES SOME OF THE SILVERCOPPER AND BISMUTHZINC ALLOYS THE REASONS OF THE FOREGOING ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE FOLLOWING 1 THAT IF WE HAD TO DEAL WITH CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS WE SHOULD NOT FIND IN THE CON DUCTING POWER OF ALLOYS THAT REGULARITY IN THE CURVES WHICH CERTAINLY EXISTS FOR ON LOOKING AT THOSE BELONGING TO THE DIFFERENT CLASSES WE SEE AT A GLANCE THAT EACH CLASS OF ALLOYS HAS A CURVE OF A DISTINCT AND SEPARATE FORM THUS FOR THE FIRST WE HAVE NEARLY A STRAIGHT LINE FOR THE SECOND THE CONDUCTING POWER ALWAYS DECREASES RAPIDLY ON THE SIDE OF THE METAL BELONGING TO CLASS B AND THEN TURNING GOES ALMOST IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO THE SIDE OF THE METAL BELONGING TO CLASS A FOR THE THIRD GROUP WE FIND A RAPID DECREMENT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CURVE AND THE TURNINGPOINTS UNITED BY ALMOST A STRAIGHT LINE IF WE NOW EXAMINE THE PART OF THE CURVE WHERE THE RAPID DECREMENT TAKES PLACE WE FIND THAT IN THE LEAD AND TIN ALLOYS IT GENERALLY REQUIRES TWICE AS MUCH OF THE FORMER AS IT DOES OF THE LATTER TO REDUCE A METAL BELONGING TO CLASS B TO A CERTAIN CONDUCTING POWER FOR INSTANCE TO REDUCE THAT OF SILVER TO 67 IT WOULD REQUIRE 09 VOL PER CENT OF LEAD OR ABOUT 05 VOL PER CENT OF TIN TO REDUCE IT TO 476 THERE WOULD BE REQUIRED 1X4 VOL PER CENT OF LEAD OR ABOUT 07 VOL PER CENT OF TIN  AGAIN TO REDUCE BISMUTH TO 0261 THERE IS REQUIRED 14 VOL PER CENT OF LEAD OR 062 VOL PER CENT OF TIN AND TO REDUCE IT TO THE MINIMUM POINT OF THE CURVE WHICH IS WHEN ALLOYED WITH LEAD 0255 AND 0245 WHEN ALLOYED WITH TIN IT REQUIRES 176 VOL PER CENT OF LEAD AND 085 VOL PER CENT OF TIN 2 WE CANNOT EXPLAIN THE REASON OF THE DECREMENT OF THE CONDUCTING POWERS BY ASSUMING THAT THE TURNINGPOINTS OF THE CURVES ARE CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS FOR IT IS NOT AT ALL PROBABLE THAT THERE ARE SUCH AS CONTAIN ONLY 06 PER CENT OF TIN AND 994 PER CENT OF BISMUTH OR 2 PER CENT OF LEAD AND 98 PER CENT OF BISMUTH OR 2F6 PER CENT OF TIN AND 974 PER CENT OF SILVER C 3 THAT THE ALLOYS AT THESE TURNINGPOINTS HAVE THEIR CALCULATED SPECIFIC GRAVITIES T ON PLATE V WE FIND THE CURVES OF THE ALLOYS BELONGING TO THE THIRD CLASS NOW HERE WE MIGHT BE INCLINED TO THINK THAT WE HAD TO DO WITH CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS BUT IF WE CONSIDER TAKING THE GOLDSILVER CURVE AS A TYPE THAT THE CONDUCTING POWER OF SILVER IS GREATLY REDUCED BY SMALL PERCENTAGES OF ANY METAL AND THAT THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF GOLD AND IF WE SUPPOSE THAT THIS DECREMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND JOIN THE TWO TURNING POINTS TO WHICH THE METALS HAVE BEEN REDUCED WE SHALL HAVE THE GOLDSILVER CURVE TAKE X THESE VALUES WERE READ OFF FROM THE CURVES T SEE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF LEADBISMUTH AND TINBISMUTH ALLOYS IN THIS VOLUME PP 162 165 166 2 A2 171DR A MATTHIESSEN ON THE ELECTRIC FOR INSTANCE THE GOLDTIN AND THE SILVERTIN CURVES AND CONNECT THE TWO TURNINGPOINTS AND WE SHALL FIND THAT THE CURVE SO MADE IS EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE GOLDSILVER AGAIN LOOK AT THAT OF THE SILVERBISMUTH AND COMPARE IT IN THE SAME MANNER WITH THE TINSILVER AND TINBISMUTH CURVES AND WE OBTAIN SIMILAR RESULTS THE GOLDBISMUTH AND SILVERBISMUTH CURVES ARE EXACTLY SIMILAR THE ALLOYS OF GOLD AND BISMUTH CONDUCTING LESS THAN THOSE OF SILVER AND BISMUTH AS WOULD BE EXPECTED AS SILVER IS A BETTER CONDUCTOR THAN GOLD FROM THE SIMILARITY OF THE CURVES OF ALLOYS WHERE WE MAY ASSUME FROM THEIR CHEMICAL BEHAVIOUR THAT WE HAVE ONLY A SOLUTION OF ONE METAL IN ANOTHER WE MAY ALWAYS DRAW APPROXIMATIVELY THE CURVE OF THE ALLOYS OF ANY TWO METALS IF WE KNOW TO WHICH CLASS THEY BELONG THUS BEFORE A SINGLE COPPERGOLD ALLOY HAD BEEN DETERMINED THE CURVE WAS ALMOST CORRECTLY DRAWN AND AGREED WITH THAT WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS FOUND BY EXPE RIMENT THAT SOME ALLOYS ARE CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS MAY BE DEDUCED FROM THE FOLLOWING FACTS 1 AT THE TURNINGPOINTS OF THE CURVE WE GENERALLY FIND THE ALLOYS CONTRACT OR EXPAND 2 THERE IS NO REGULAR FORM OF CURVE SEE THOSE OF GOLDTIN GOLDLEAD AND SILVER COPPER SO THAT IT CANNOT BE A PRIORI EVEN APPROXIMATIVELY REPRESENTED 3 AT THE TURNINGPOINTS THE ALLOYS CONTAIN LARGE PERCENTAGES OF EACH METAL 4 AT THE TURNINGPOINTS OF THE CURVES THE ALLOYS ARE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER IN APPEARANCE CRYSTALLINE FORM C NOW LET US FOR A MOMENT EXAMINE THE GOLDTIN CURVE IT BEING THE ONLY NEARLY COM PLETE ONE OF THIS CLASS AND STARTING FROM THE TIN SIDE OF IT WE FIND A SLOW DECREMENT IN THE CONDUCTING POWER TO THE ALLOY SN5 AU THEN A SLOW INCREMENT TO SN2 AU AND FROM THIS POINT A SLOW DECREMENT TO SN AU2 FOR REASONS BEFORE GIVEN NO ALLOYS COULD BE DETER MINED BETWEEN SN AU2 AND THAT CONTAINING 27 PER CENT OF TIN FROM WHICH POINT THE CURVE GOES IN A STRAIGHT LINE TO PURE GOLD STARTING AGAIN FROM THE TIN SIDE OF THE CURVE WE MAY REGARD THE ALLOYS DOWN TO SN5 AU AS A SOLUTION OF A CHEMICAL COMBINATION IN A METAL FROM SN5 AU TO SN2 AU AND FROM SN2 AU TO SN AU2 AS A SOLUTION OF TWO CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS IN EACH OTHER AS ALL OF THESE POINTS ARE CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER BY STRAIGHT LINES AND FROM SN AU2 TO THE ALLOY CONTAINING 2 7 PER CENT OF TIN AS A SOLUTION OF A CHEMICAL COMBINATION IN AN ALLOY AND FROM THIS POINT TO PURE GOLD AS A SOLUTION OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF TIN IN GOLD NOW THESE TURNINGPOINTS CONTAIN FIRST SN5 AU 60 PER CENT SECOND SN2 AU 37 PER CENT AND THIRD SNAU2 13 PER CENT OF TIN WHICH MAY VERY WELL BE CONSIDERED TO BE CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS ON LOOKING AT THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITIES WE FIND THAT SN5 AU HAS ALMOST ITS CALCULATED ONE WHEREAS SN2 AU EXPANDS AND SN AU2 CONTRACTS MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF THE GOLDTIN ALLOYS EXPERIMENTED WITH IN THEIR GENERAL APPEARANCE WE SEE THAT SN AU2 AND SN2 AU ARE NOT AT ALL CRYSTALLINE AND HAVE A VERY GLASSY FRACTURE BUT SN5 AU IS EXCEEDINGLY CRYSTALLINE AND ALWAYS SHOWS ON BEING BROKEN THE CLEAVAGE PLANE OF A CRYSTAL FROM ONE END OF THE PIECE TO THE OTHER 172CONDUCTING POWER OF ALLOYS FOR THE ABOVE REASONS I THINK THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE IRREGULARITY OF THE GOLDTIN CURVE IS DUE TO CHEMICAL COMBINATION AND THAT THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE GOLDLEAD CURVE THAT SOME ALLOYS ARE MECHANICAL MIXTURES WE KNOW FROM FACTS DETERMINED BY OTHER EXPERIMENTERS THUS WHEN WE FUSE 1773 PARTS OF BISMUTH AND 1612 PARTS OF ZINC TOGE THER WE FIND TWO LAYERS THE UPPER ONE CONSISTING OF 1340 PARTS OF ZINC AND THE LOWER ONE 1940 PARTS OF BISMUTH ALLOYED WITH TRACES OF ZINC NOW HAD WE STIRRED THE TWO METALS WELL TOGETHER AND COOLED RAPIDLY THE ALLOY SO OBTAINED IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS A MECHANICAL MIXTURE AGAIN ACCORDING TO LEVOLT IF WE FUSE SILVER AND COPPER TOGETHER AND ALLOW THE ALLOY TO REMAIN QUIETLY IN THE FUSED STATE WE FIND ON ANALYSING THE MASS THAT DIFFERENT PARTS CONTAIN DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES OF METAL HE FOUND THIS TO BE THE CASE WITH ALL ALLOYS EXCEPTING THAT CONTAINING 28F11 PER CENT OF COPPER WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE FORMULA AG3 CU4 LEVOL REGARDS ALL ALLOYS OF SILVER AND COPPER AS MIXTURES OF AG3 CU4 AND EITHER SILVER OR COPPER IF THIS WERE THE CASE WE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND FROM THAT POINT TO PURE SILVER OR COPPER STRAIGHT LINES BUT ON EXAMINING THAT CURVE STARTING FROM THE COPPER SIDE OF IT WE FIRST SEE THAT A RAPID DECREMENT TAKES PLACE CAUSED BY THE COPPER BEING ALLOYED WITH A SMALL QUANTITY OF SILVER FROM THAT ALLOY CONTAINING 90 VOLS PER CENT TO THAT OF 35 VOLS PER CENT OF COPPER WE HAVE A STRAIGHT LINE AND WE MAY REGARD THE INTERMEDIATE ALLOYS AS MIXTURES OR SOLUTIONS OF THESE TWO ALLOYS FROM THE ALLOY CONTAINING 35 VOLS PER CENT TO THAT WITH 28 VOLS PER CENT OF COPPER WE MAY HAVE A MIXTURE OR SOLUTION OF THOSE ALLOYS NOW THIS LAST POINT IS THE MINIMUM POINT OF THE CURVE AND CORRESPONDS ALMOST TO LEVOLS AG3 CU4 BEING AN ALLOY CONTAINING 25 PER CENT BY WEIGHT OF COPPER THIS AS WELL AS THE OTHER LOWEST POINTS OF THE CURVES MUST NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ACTUALLY THE LOWEST BUT ONLY AS THE LOWEST POINT FOUND FOR IN THIS CASE WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT THE ALLOY CONTAINING 28 PER CENT OF COPPER WOULD BE LOWER AND FROM THIS POINT TO PURE SILVER THE ALLOYS MAY BE MIXTURES OR PERHAPS SOLUTIONS OF THAT ALLOY AND SILVER CONTAINING A SMALL QUANTITY OF COPPER NOW IT WOULD APPEAR AS IF AT ABOUT THE POINT WHICH REPRESENTS THE ALLOY CONTAINING 35 VOLS PER CENT OF COPPER THERE WAS ALSO ONE OF CONSTANT COMPOSITION OTHERWISE WE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE ALLOY CONTAINING 28 VOLS PER CENT TO THAT CONTAINING 90 VOLS PER CENT OF COPPER OF COURSE FROM THIS ONE CURVE WE CAN HARDLY DEDUCE ANY CONCLUSIONS AS WE HAVE IN ALL PROBABILITY TO DEAL WITH MIXTURES OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS WITH SOLUTIONS OF THE ONE METAL IN THE OTHER C IT ONLY SHOWS THAT BY THE DETERMINATION OF THE CONDUCTING POWERS OF THE ALLOYS WE ARE ABLE TO TELL WHERE THESE ARE CONSTANT OR CHEMICAL COMBINA TIONS AND WHEN THE CURVES ARE IRREGULAR WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS OR MECHANICAL MIXTURES THAT THE FIRST GROUP OF ALLOYS THEIR CURVES BEING NEARLY STRAIGHT LINES ARE NOT MIX  FOURNET ANN DE CHIM ET DE PLIYS VOL LIV P 247 T JOURN DE PHARM VOL XVII P 111 173DR A MATTHIESSEN ON THE ELECTRIC TURES BUT SOLUTIONS OF ONE METAL IN THE OTHER MAY BE DEDUCED FROM THE FACT OF THEIR FUSINGPOINTS BEING GENERALLY LOWER THAN THE MEAN OF THAT OF THE VOLUMES TAKEN SECONDLY TO WHAT IS THE RAPID DECREMENT OF THE CONDUCTING POWER DUE  THE ONLY ANSWER WHICH I CAN AT PRESENT GIVE TO THIS QUESTION IS THAT MOST OF THE OTHER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE METAL ARE ALTERED IN A LIKE MANNER FOR ON LOOKING AT THE ALLOYS MADE WITH THE METALS OF CLASS A WITH ONE ANOTHER WE SEE THAT MOST OF THEIR OTHER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES ARE NOT AT ALL ALTERED FOR AMONGST THEM FOR INSTANCE WE FIND NO BRITTLE ONES THEY APPEAR IN FACT TO TAKE AN EQUAL SHARE OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE METALS COMPOSING THEM BUT NOW LET US EXAMINE THE ALLOYS OF THE SECOND CLASS AND WE IMMEDIATELY DISCOVER GREAT DIFFERENCES ALLOY GOLD THE MOST DUCTILE OF ALL METALS WITH SMALL PERCENTAGES OF TIN LEAD OR ZINC AND IT BECOMES AS BRITTLE AS GLASS AGAIN ALLOY SILVER WITH SMALL PERCENTAGES OF THE ABOVE METALS AND ITS PROPERTIES ARE MUCH ALTERED SILVER WHICH WHEN PURE IS ONE OF THE EASIEST METALS TO DRAW WHEN ALLOYED WITH MORE THAN 3 PER CENT OF TIN AND 2 PER CENT OF LEAD BECOMES SO BRITTLE AND ITS TENACITY SO MUCH IMPAIRED THAT IT CANNOT BE DRAWN I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY IT IS IMPOS SIBLE TO DO SO BUT IT WAS TRIED SEVERAL TIMES WITHOUT SUCCESS ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO NOT FIND ANY MARKED DIFFERENCES IN THE DUCTILITY HARDNESS C OF TIN OR LEAD WHEN ALLOYED WITH SILVER WE MAY ADD 10 NAY EVEN 20 PER CENT OF SILVER TO THEM AND THEY REMAIN DUCTILE AND MAY BE PRESSED INTO WIRE WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE OF COURSE WITH LEAD AND TIN ALLOYED WITH SMALL QUANTITIES OF GOLD THE CASE IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT AS WE HAVE HERE CHEMICAL COMBINATIONS COMING INTO PLAY NEVERTHELESS WE MAY ADD TO THEM 5 PER CENT OF GOLD WITHOUT ALTERING THEIR DUCTILITY C TO ANY GREAT EXTENT BISMUTH ALLOYED WITH LEAD OR TIN BECOMES MORE BRITTLE AND IN WIRE ITS TENACITY IS IMPAIRED BUT TIN AND LEAD ALLOYED WITH LARGE PERCENTAGES OF BISMUTH ALWAYS RETAIN A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DUCTILITY C AGAIN TAKE THE ALLOYS OF THE THIRD CLASS ALTHOUGH AMONGST THE GOLDSILVER AND THE GOLDCOPPER ALLOYS WE FIND NO BRITTLE ONES YET WE KNOW HOW HARD GOLD SILVER AND COPPER BECOME WHEN WE ALLOY THEM WITH SMALL QUANTITIES OF OTHER METALS AND THAT THEY LOSE MORE IN PROPORTION OF THEIR DUCTILITY C BY THE ADDITION OF SMALL THAN OF LARGE QUAN TITIES OF STRANGE METAL FROM THESE FACTS WE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED AT THE RAPID DECREMENT OF THE CONDUCTING POWERS OF THE METALS BELONGING TO CLASS B WHEN ALLOYED WITH ANY OTHER METAL FOR WHEN WE FIND MOST OF THEIR OTHER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES MORE OR LESS GREATLY ALTERED BY TRACES OF FOREIGN METALS MIGHT WE NOT ALSO HAVE EXPECTED THIS RESULT FOR WHERE WE SEE NO MARKED CHANGE IN MOST OF THE OTHER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ALLOYS AS IN THE FIRST CLASS AND IN THE SECOND ON THE ONE SIDE OF THE CURVE THERE WE HAVE NEARLY THEIR CALCU LATED CONDUCTING POWERS IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO DETERMINE QUANTITATIVELY SOME OF THE OTHER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ALLOYS TO SEE WHETHER IN THEM THE TSE PROPERTIES WILL DECREASE IN THE SAME MARKED MANNER AS THE CONDUCTING POWERS WHEN A METAL BELONGING TO CLASS B IS ALLOYED WITH ANY OTHER METAL I INTEND THEREFORE TO COMMENCE ESPECIALLY WITH THIS 174CONDUCTING POWER OF ALLOYS VIEW WITH THE CONDUCTING POWER FOR HEAT IN ORDER TO SEE IF THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE METALS AND ALLOYS GIVEN IN THIS PAPER WILL HOLD GOOD FOR ANY OF THE OTHER PHYSICAL PRO PERTIES AS WELL AS IN THE HOPE OF FINDING OUT THE CAUSE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE METALS OF CLASS B WHEN ALLOYED WITH TRACES OF ANY OTHER ON LOOKING AT THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF ALLOYS WE FIND THAT THEY CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS ABOVE BUT IN ALL PROBABILITY THE ABOVE CLASSIFICATION WILL HOLD GOOD FOR THEIR TENACITY HARDNESS CONDUCTING POWER FOR HEAT C APPENDIX ON THE ELECTRIC CONDUCTING POWER OF PURE GOLD THE VALUES GIVEN FOR THE CONDUCTING POWER OF PURE GOLD IN MY PAPER  ON THE ELEC TRIC CONDUCTING POWER OF THE METALS T IS NOT QUITE CORRECT AS THE GOLD FROM SOME CAUSE CANNOT HAVE BEEN CHEMICALLY PURE ALTHOUGH PREPARED WITH THE GREATEST CARE BY DR MEYBOOM YET THE WIREDRAWER IN ALL PROBABILITY FUSED IT IN A CRUCIBLE WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY USED AND AS ONLY 3 TO 4 GRMS WERE PURIFIED A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF IMPURITY WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE WHICH I HAVE LATELY FOUND AT THE TIME THE VALUES APPEARED VERY LOW COMPARED WITH THOSE OF OTHER EXPERIMENTERS BUT IT WAS THEN THOUGHT THAT THE HIGHER ONES WERE DUE TO TRACES OF SILVER EXPERIMENTS HOWEVER HAVE PROVED ON THE CONTRARY THAT MOST OF THE GOLDSILVER GOLDCOPPER C ALLOYS CONDUCT ELECTRICITY WORSE THAN PURE GOLD AND THAT IN FACT ONLY THOSE WHICH CONTAIN LESS

four sections a section on metallurgy a section on mechanical engineer ing a section on electrical engineering and a section on prime movers The work of each section was under a chairman who was directly responsible to the chairman of the division The section on metallurgy had for its prin cipal work the solving of metallurgical prob lems arising in connection with the conduct of the war more particularly those brought to it by the military Thbis work was accomplished through the medium of committees whose personnel included leading authorities upon metallurgy The section of mechanical engineering es tablished a drafting room in charge of a chief draftsman at research council headquarters and through the generosity of the Carnegie Institute of Teehnology a machine shop at Pittsburgh under the direction of a foreman These were used for the development of in ventions referred to the section by the physics and engineering divisions The section on electrical engineering con centrated its efforts upon the problem of elec tric welding more particularly electric weld ing as applied to ship building This section worked in very close cooperation with the Emergency Fleet Corporation who financed its investigative work The section on prime movers devoted its at tention chiefly to the design and development of power plants for aircraft A ddrss givei at jaint sessio f the National

division is now performing all its functions and beginsits career a oTwng concet A lan of close affiliation of the division with the engineeriing oundation has recently been approved s1by the members of the IfOaudation and the executive board of ithe fatirnal Research Council By the terrmsof this agreement the engineering foundation will provide the engineering division an office in te Engineerig

committees hut difficult to get them to func tion properly  iry teareful comsideration has been given the problem of organizing the re search committees of the engineering division We have found thatgiven an energetic chair man who is master of his subject and who in spires confidence an active gronp within the comittee to perform the necessary iresearches a still wider grou4p who may not have time to devote to research but who throughbreadth of experience are particularly well qualified to act in an advisory opacity and last but not leaast the necessary funds and important re suits are sure to follow Time will not permit of goirg into the work of thecommittees in detail The work so far undertaken covers the fields of metallurgy lectrical engineering mechanical engineering and to a less extent eivl ergineering The engineering division now has some fourteen committees at work upon various problems At present fourteen staes extend ing from the Atlantic to the Paoific are repre sented and the number is rpidly inoreasing Men connected with educational institutions the military and civilian bureaus of the gov ernment and large manufaaturing conerns are willing andteveneager

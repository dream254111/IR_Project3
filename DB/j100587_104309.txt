N S IN THE 3D HE GIVES A METEORO LOGICAL DIARY FROM JAN 1 TO 18 AND IN THE 4TH THE REVD MR NEVES OBSERVATION ON DEC 31  JAN 11 OF TWO PARHELIA NEAR PETERBOROUGH BUT THESE DESCRIPTIONS HAVE BEEN ALREADY COMMUNICATED TO THE ROYAL SO N N N 2 CIETY460 CIETY  IN THE 5TH HE COMPARES THE TWO OBSERVA TIONS IN THE 6TH AND 7TH HE MENTIONS SEVERAL PAR HELII TAKEN NOTICE OF BY THE ANTIENTS AND MODERNS AND IN THE 8TH ENUMERATES THE DIFFERENT OBSERVABLES OF THIS PHAENOMENON FOR THE BETTER INVESTIGATING ITS CAUSES THE 9TH GIVES THE OPINIONS OF SEVERAL OF THE AN TIENTS CONCERNING THE PRESAGES TAKEN FROM MOCK SUNS FROM THE 10TH TO THE 13TH INCLUSIVE HE RELATES DIVERS MANNERS OF ACCOUNTING FOR THEM BY THE CHIEF OF THE ANTIENTS AND MODERNS IN THE 14TH PREPARATORY TO HIS OWN OPINION HE LAYS DOWN THE DOCTRINE OF THE RISE OF VAPOURS IN SMALL GLOBULAR BUBBLES OF AIR WITH A WATERY COAT TO EACH IN THE 15TH HE REFUTES BY SEVERAL REASONS AND EXPERIMENTS HUYGENSS MANNER OF ACCOUNTING FOR HALOES WHICH IS BY A VAST NUMBER OF VERY SMALL VAPOURS EACH WITH A SNOWY NUCLEUS COATED ROUND WITH A TRANSPARENT COVERING AND SAYS THAT WHEN THE SUN DEPICTS ITS IMAGE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND BY THE FORCE OF ITS RAYS PUTS THE VAPOURS IN MOTION AND DRIVES THEM TOWARDS THE SURFACE TILL THEY ARE COLLECTED IN SUCH A QUANTITY AND AT SUCH A DISTANCE FROM THE SUN ON EACH SIDE THAT ITS RAYS ARE TWICE REFRACTED AND TWICE REFLECTED BY THE TIME THEY REACH THE EYE THEY EXHIBIT THE APPEARANCE OF A HALO ADORNED WITH THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW WHICH MAY HAPPEN IN GLOBULAR PELLUCID VAPOURS WITHOUT SNOWY NUCLEI AS APPEARS BY THE EXPERIMENT OF HOL LOW GLASS SPHERES FILLED WITH WATER THEREFORE WHENEVER THOSE SPHERICAL VAPOURS ARE SITUATED AS BE FORE  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS NO 445461 FORE THE REFRACTIONS AND REFLEXIONS WILL HAPPEN EVERYWHERE ALIKE AND THE FIGURE OF A CIRCULAR CROWN WITH THE USUAL ORDER OF COLOURS WILL BE THE CONSEQUENCE AS TO THE HALO THAT ATTENDS PARHELIA BEING 44 OR 45 DEGREES IN DIAMETER HE ADOPTS GASSENDIS OPINION AS PROBABLE WHO APPLIES TO IT THE GEOME TRICAL THEOREM DE ANGULO AD CENTRUM DUPLO AN GULI AD PERIPHERIAM FOR WHEN A HALO SURROUNDS THE SUN THE SUN IS IN THE CENTRE AND THE EYE OUT OF IT AS IT WERE ON THE SURFACE OF THE PHAENOMENON WHEREAS WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARS THE EYE IS PLACED IN A LINE DRAWN FROM THE SUN TO THE CENTRE OF THE RAINBOW AND THUS THE EYE SERVES FOR A CENTRE FROM WHICH THE DIAMETER OF THE IRIS IS  THE SUN BEING PLACED ON THE CIRCUMFERENCE YET HE SAYS IT STILL REMAINS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHY WHEN TWO HALBES APPEAR AT ONCE THE GREATER IS DOUBLE THE DIAMETER OF THE LESS I E ABOUT 90 DEGREES 16TH BUT AS HALOES OFTEN APPEAR ABOUT THE SUN AND MOON WITHOUT PARHELIA OR PARASELINAE THERE MUST BE A PECULIAR DISPOSITION OF VAPOURS REQUISITE FOR FORMING PARHELII PARHELII HE SAYS ARE SITUATE EITHER IN THE INTER SECTION OF A VERTICAL HALO AND THE HORIZONTAL AN NULUS WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE SUN OR IN THE SECTION OF SOME HORIZONTAL BANDS AND THE CORONA AND THE ANGULAR FIGURE OF PARHELIA LEAVES US NO ROOM TO DOUBT THAT IT IS PRODUCED BY PLANES OF THE ANNULUS OR BANDS RUNNING INTO THE CORONA NOW NEWTONS THEORY OF COLOURS AND THE EXPERIMENTS IT IS BUILT UPON SHEW THAT WHITENESS WHICH IS A HETEROGENEOUS LIGHT IS RESTORED BY BLENDING OR COL LECTING462 COLLECTING THE COLOURED LIGHTS AND THIS WILL LIKE WISE HAPPEN WHEN THE WHITE HETEROGENEOUS LIGHT OF THE BRIGHT RING OR BAND DOES PENETRATE AND CON FOUND THE RAYS OF THE HALO NOW SOMEWHAT WEAK ENED IT IS PLAIN THAT IN ORDER TO A GENUINE EXPLI CATION OF MOCKSUNS IT IS CHIEFLY REQUISITE TO HAVE A CLEAR NOTION OF THE ORIGIN OF THE HORIZONTAL RING OR BANDS AND FROM HUYGENSS EXPERIMENT WITH A CYLINDRIC GLASS FULL OF WATER EXPOSED TO THE SUN WHICH PRODUCES A WHITE HORIZONTAL RING BY REFLEXION ALONE WITHOUT AN OPAKE NUCLEUS HE ASSERTS THAT THE HORIZONTAL BANDS THAT INTERSECT THE SOLAR CORONAE ARE FORMED WHEN CYLINDRIC FROZEN VAPOURS ARE SUSPENDED ABOUT THE SUN CHIEFLY WHERE THE HALO IS DEPICTED IN A SITUATION PERPENDICULAR TO THE HORI ZON WHICH BEING RECTILINEAR EACH OF THEM EXHIBITS BY REFLEXION A LUCID LINE EQUAL TO THE SUNS DIA METER AND SEVERAL OF THESE OPTIC LINES JOINING COM POSE THE PLANE OF THE RING OR BAND HIS LAST SECTION IS SPENT IN EXPLAINING THE APPEAR ANCE OF PART OF AN INVERTED IRIS WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIS MOCKSUNS IN ORDER TO WHICH HE THUS ACCOUNTS FOR A COMMON OR PRIMARY RAINBOW A PRIMARY IRIS IS FORMED WHEN THE SUNS RAYS FALLING ON DROPS OF RAIN AFTER SUFFERING TWO RE FRACTIONS AND ONE REFLEXION TEND TO THE EYE IN SUCH A DIRECTION THAT THE AXIS OF THE IRIS COMING DI RECTLY FROM ITS CENTRE AND PASSING BY THE EYE TO THE SUN MAKES WITH THESE RAYS RETURNING FROM THE DROPS AN ANGLE OF 40 DEGREES BELOW AND OF 42 DEGREES ABOVE WHEREBY THE WIDTH OF THE IRIS IS 20 15 AND ITS DIAMETER 420 17 BUT AS THIS INVERTED IRIS WAS BUT ONE DEGREE BROAD AND THE DIAMETER OF THE ARCH PROBABLY BUT HALF THAT 2 OF463 OF THE PRIMARY IRIS HE IS OF OPINION THAT THE SUNS RAYS REFRACTED AND REFLECTED AS ABOVE ENTERED THE EYE AT HALF THE AFORESAID ANGLE BY THE EYES BEING PLACED BEYOND THE POINT WHERE THE RAYS MET WITH THE AXIS FOR THUS THE ORDER OF THE COLOURS IS PRE SERVED AND THIS IRIS IS BUT HALF THE SIZE OF THE COMMON ONE AS AN APPENDIX TO THIS TRACT PROFESSOR WEIDLER ADDS THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF THE REMARKABLE RED LIGHTS ON THE 165 DECEMBER 1737 SEEN NOT ONLY BY HIM AT WITTEMBERG BUT HERE AT LONDON AND IN MOST PARTS OF EUROPE DECEMBER 9 1737 THE BAROMETER WAS REMARKABLY LOW VIZ 28 INCHES 8 LINES ENGLISH MEASURE IT RAINED ALL THAT DAY VERY PLENTIFULLY AND FROM THENCE TO THE END OF THE MONTH THE SKY WAS MUCH LOADED WITH THICK VAPOURS BUT ON THE 16TH THE LITTLE WIND THERE WAS BEING AT NORTHWEST AND THE BARO METER AT 30 INCHES 2 LINES 34 LONDON MEASURE SOON AFTER SUNSET THE MOON IN ITS LAST QUARTER THE SKY BEGAN TO APPEAR VERY RED AND FROM SEVEN TO NINE GAVE A LIGHT AS STRONG AS THAT OF THE FULL MOON BE HIND A THIN CLOUD THE WHOLE SKY WAS OF THAT COLOUR WHICH IS OCCASIONED BY A FIRE SEEN AT A DISTANCE IN THE NIGHT SUCH AN UNCOMMON SIGHT PUT THE INHABITANTS OF THIS TOWN IN GREAT TERROR THE GREATEST BRIGHTNESS HERE WAS ABOUT 8 H 45 FROM WHICH TIME IT GRADUALLY DECREASED AND AT A QUARTER AFTER NINE IT SEEMED ALMOST DISSIPATED BUT IT RE TURNED NOWANDTHEN AND CONTINUED BY INTERVALS ALL NIGHT NOW THOUGH THE WHOLE FACE OF THE HEA VENS WAS REMARKABLY RED YET THE GREATEST BRIGHTNESS WAS464 WAS IN THE NORTH AND A LITTLE TO THE WEST THERE WERE NEITHER PYRAMIDS NOR LUMINOUS STREAMINGS SO COMMON IN AURORAE BOREALES NOR EVEN THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF THE HORIZONTAL BLACK CLOUD AT NORTH THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS EQUALLY DARK WITH THE PRE CEDING YET WITHOUT THE LEAST REMAINS OF THE REDNESS SUCH WAS THE FACE OF THE HEAVENS AT WITTEMBERG AND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND SOON AFTER THE PUBLIC NEWS GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIKE PHAENO MENON BEING SEEN AT VIENNA VENICE MANTUA FLO RENCE ROME AND SOME OTHER PLACES AT VIENNA THE GREATEST BRIGHTNESS WAS OBSERVED AT 9 H 15 THE MOST ENLIGHTENED PARTS WERE THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHSOUTHEAST AND THERE WERE SOME RETURNS OF THE BRIGHTNESS ON THE 17TH AND 18TH BUT IN ITALY AT MANTUA FLORENCE AND ROME THE REDNESS WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH LUCID COLUMNS AND PYRAMIDS AND FROM ROME IN PARTICULAR THEY WRITE THAT THIS AURORA BOREALIS EXCEEDED IN BRIGHTNESS ALL THOSE THAT HAD BEEN HITHERTO OBSERVED FROM THESE OBSERVA TIONS IT IS NO DIFFICULT MATTER TO DEDUCE THE CAUSES OF THESE RED LIGHTS THAT THIS AURORA BOREALIS ON THE 16TH WAS A VERY CONSIDERABLE ONE APPEARS BOTH BY THE GREAT EXPAN SION OF THE LUMINOUS MATTER FROM ITS RISE IN THE NORTH TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND BY THE RETURN OF THE BRIGHTNESS SEEN AT VIENNA ON THE SUBSEQUENT DAYS AT MANTUA THE NORTHERN LIGHT REACHED THE ZENITH AND IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE IT DID SO IN OUR MORE NORTHERN HORIZON WHEREFORE AS THE MATTER WAS COLLECTED AT THE ZENITH THE LIGHT WAS REFLECTED THENCE TO ALL PARTS OF THE SKY BUT AS THE LOWER REGION OF OUR ATMOSPHERE WAS AT THE SAME TIME OVERSPREAD WITH465 WITH VAPOURS OF A CERTAIN UNIFORM DENSITY AND IN TIRELY PROPER FOR SEPARATING AN HOMOGENEOUS LIGHT THOSE RAYS OF THE HETEROGENEOUS LIGHT WHICH ARE THE LEAST REFRANGIBLE OR WHICH PRODUCE THE RED CO LOUR WERE ACCORDINGLY SEPARATED BY REFLEXION AND REFRACTION IN GREAT QUANTITIES AND COLOURED THE WHOLE SKY WITH A FIRY REDNESS AND WHERE THE LIGHT WAS BRIGHTEST VIZ BETWEEN THE NORTH AND WEST WHICH IS GENERALLY THE FOCUS OF AURORAE BO REALES THERE LIKEWISE THE REDNESS WAS STRONGEST III

in particular of the H Y P N U M terrestre trichoides luteovirenus vulgare majus capitulis erectis R A I I Synops Ed 3 pag 84 S I R T H E many late Discoveries of the Seeds of Vegetables for merly supposed to produce none have opened a Way Read Feb 13 17456 with Alterations61 Way to an extensive Scene of Knowledge and led to a Series of Observations in which there will be found an almost inexhaustible Store of Delight and Admiration The Mosses in particular one of the most beautiful Parts of the vegetable Creation will afford the curious Observer more Matter of Enter tainment than perhaps any other Class of it A Specimen of which I do myself the Honour of com municating to you in this Letter The particular Observations it contains though new and surprising you will allow unquestionable in Fact and Certainty when I add that they are what I have not only often repeated myself but have also shewn to Mr Baker Dr Parsons and Mr Needham Gentlemen of too nice Eyes and too conversant in Observations of this kind not to have discovered Mistakes if there had been any and who all agree that no Discovery by the Microscope was ever clearer The Manner of seeding of the Mosses in general is a Thing perhaps as little understood as any Part of the vegetable System What I have to offer here is the explaining and describing it clearly in one Species at least from a Number of Observations made on it in its different States and at different Seasons of the Year The thorough Knowledge of the Operations of Nature in the Seeding of one of these little Plants may I hope be a fair Step to the discovering it in them all And the almost infinite Variety of not only Species but Genuss in this Class of Vegetables seems to promise the Inquirer a vast Variety of new Discoveries I shall62 I shall not trouble you to whom I very well know there is no need of repeating any Part of the Labours of the antient or later Naturalists with an Account of the erroneous Opinions of others on this Subject you will find by this Account that those who have been used to judge well in other Parts of Botany have been altogether mistaken here And even the ac curate Mr Hook who of all others has come nearest a Discovery of the Truth and who actually saw some Part of the Organization of these little Bodies was so far from making the least Guess at the Nature and Uses of what he saw that he even mistook the Structure of it The particular Species of Moss whose Head I here send you a Description of is the Hypnum terrestre trichoides luteovirens vulgare majus capitulis erectis Raii Synops ed 3 p 84 Hypnum vul gare sericeum recurvum capsulis erectis cuspidatis Dill Hist Musc 323 It is frequent on old Walls and there is a Specimen of it in the third Volume of the Hortus siccus of English Plants of my collecting which you honour with a Place in your Library The Head of this Moss appears to the naked Eye as at Fig 3 T A B I of a palebrown Colour and smooth Surface and is in Part coverd with a membranaceous Calyptra relembling in Shape an Extinguisher or a Funnel inverted When this Calyptra is taken off and the Head placed before the Microscope the Sur face of it is seen to be ridgd with longitudinal Striae the Basis of the Head is of a dark Orangecolour and more opaque than the rest and the Top is bounded by an orangecolourd Ring swelling out something beyond63 beyond the Surface of the contiguous Parts of the Head A close Observation and good Glasses have informd me that in this little Head there are not wanting the Parts essential to the Fructification of what are com monly called the more perfect Plants This Ring is truly a monophyllous undulated Calyx and within it arise sixteen pyramidal fimbriated Stami na These are of a palegreenish Colour and are loaded with a white oval FarinaThe Stamina all bend toward each other from their Bases and almost meet in a Point at their Tops This is their Appearance when the Head is nearly ripe and is what is expressd at Fig 4 TABI And immediately under the Arch formed by these Stamina is placd a slender cylindric hollow Pistillum thro which the Farina makes its Way and is dispersed among the Seeds in the Head The external Membrane of the Head is a Continu ation of the outer Covering of the Stalk and is strengthend at its Basis by four or five Ribs which soon lose themselves in the Striae A longitudinal Section of the Head shews that the Membrane beforementioned incloses a Seedvessel so large as to fill it every Way In most Places they touch but whereever they do not a Number of very slender white and transparent Fibres shew themselves which join them together This Seed vessel is filld with perfect and very beautiful Seeds they are round transparent while unripe but af terwards opaque and of a very beautiful Green which Colour they retain even when dried The Number of Seeds in one of these Heads is astonishingly great I have many times attempted to count64 count them in such as were full and out of which few or none had been dislodgd by the Cutting and as the Accountsat different Times and various in Heads have not much differd I shall venture to insert a Guess from them It will easily be conceived that in Seeds so minute as well as numerous this must be a very difficult Task and indeed to count every separate Seed I believe would be not much less than impossible The Method therefore by which I make the Calculation is this I count in an eighth Part of the Circumference of one Half of the Head nine Seeds 9  8  72 there are therefore 72 Seeds in a Line which reaches round the Circumference of one Half of the Head I judge the Length of this Half to be to its Circum ference as 3 to 2 or thereabout Therefore in one longitudinal Line in it there must be 96 Seeds the whole Quantity in the Half of the Head therefore is 72  96  6912 and doubling that for the equal Number of Seeds of the other Half there appear to be in one Head 2  6912  13824 Seeds Fig 5 TAB I shews a longitudinal Section of the Head with the Seeds the Stamina and the joining of the Capsule with the external Membrane of the Head The Stamina examined alone afford a most pleasing Sight they are composed of a white trans parent Substance of a pyramidal Figure everywhere coverd with a palegreenish Crust which is the Re ceptacle of a vast Quantity of an oval Farina so ex tremely minute as to be visible only with the most powerful Magnifiers in the double Microscope The outer Membrane of the Head becomes separa ble from the Capsule when perfectly ripe and dry and65 and then viewd in the double Microscope shews a reticular Texture not visible in it before When this Head is first produced from the Plant the Stamina are very slender and stand erect the Head is scarce any thicker than the Stalk and the Calyptra covers the Whole to shield the tender Sub stance of the Farina from external Injuries As the Farina afterwards swells in the Stamina the Seeds also in the Head increase in Bulk and become visible and are then transparent but when it is perfectly ripe the Calyptra falls off and the Wind dislodging the Farina at times as it ripens some sooner some later it makes its Way through the Pistillum into the Head and the Seeds then become much larger and opaque to favour the Falling of the Farina into the Pistillum the Stamina as they ripen are by the Increase of Thickness in the Head thrown far ther and farther from each other at their Bases but bend inward at the Points so as to form a kind of Arch over the Opening of it The annual Product of these most minute Seeds is astonishing An ingenious Gentlemen has given in No 468 of these Transactions p 320 an Account of the wonderful Increase of the Mallow one of which he found to yield in one Year 200000 But this is much inferior to those of the little Plant be fore us for allowing to a Root of this 8 Branches and to each Branch six Heads which any one who will observe it in a thriving Situation will find a very moderate Computation the Produce of this is 6  13824  82944 and 8  82944  663552 Seeds the annual Produce of one Seed 13824 of which are containd in a Head whose Length is I but66 but 19 of an Inch and its Diameter but 123 of an Inch and whose Weight is but the thirteenth Part of a Grain I am S I R With the greatest Respect Your very obedient Humble Servant John Hill Broadway Westminster Feb 6

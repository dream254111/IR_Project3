CONNECTED WITH THE SURVEY OF THE COAST OF THE UNITED STATES BY F R HASSLERCOMMW NICATED 3D MARCH 1820 CIRCULAR LETTER TREASURY DEPARTMENT 25TH MARCH 1807 SIR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BEING AUTHORISED BY AN ACT OF THE LAST SESSION TO CAUSE THE WHOLE OF THE COAST OF THE SAID STATES TOGETHER WITH THE ADJACENT SHOALS AND SOUNDINGS TO BE SURVEYED IT IS HIS INTENTION THAT THE WORK SHOULD BE EXECUTED WITH AS MUCH CORRECTNESS AS CAN BE OB TAINED WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME AND HE HAS DIRECTED ME TO APPLY TO YOU REQUESTING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SUGGEST THE OUTLINES OF SUCH A PLAN AS MAY IN YOUR OPINION UNITE CORRECTNESS AND PRACTICABILITY AS EACH NAUTICAL SURVEY OF THE SHOALS AND SOUNDINGS PRE SUPPOSES A KNOWLEDGE OF THE POSITION OF CERTAIN POINTS OF THE COAST IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE WORK SHOULD CONSIST OF THREE DISTINCT PARTS VIZ T THE ASCERTAINMENT BY A SERIES OF ASTRONOMICAL OBSER VATIONS OF THE TRUE POSITION OF A FEW REMARKABLE POINTS ONSURVEY OF THE COAST OP THE UNITED STATES 233 THE COAST  AND SOME OF THE LIGHT HOUSES PLACED ON THE PRINCI PAL CAPES OR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRINCIPAL HARBOURS AP PEAR TO BE THE MOST ELIGIBLE PLACES FOR THAT PURPOSE AS BEING OBJECTS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING TO NAVIGATORS VISIBLE AT A GREAT DISTANCE AND GENERALLY ERECTED ON SPOTS ON WHICH SIMI LAR BUILDINGS WILL BE CONTINUED SO LONG AS NAVIGATION EXISTS 2 A TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY OF THE COAST BETWEEN THOSE POINTS OF WHICH THE POSITION SHALL HAVE BEEN ASTRONOMICALLY ASCERTAINED IN THE EXECUTION OF WHICH SURVEY THE LOSITION OF EVERY DISTINGUISHABLE PERMANLENT OBJECT SHOULD BE CARE FULLY DESIGNATED AND TEMPORARY BEACONS BE ERECTED AT PRO PER DISTANCES ON THOSE PARTS OF THE COAST ON WHICHI SUCH OB JECTS ARE RARELY FOUIND 3 A NAUTICAL SURVEY OF THE SLHOALS AND SOUNDINGS OF THE COAST OF WLHICH THE TRIGONOMETRICAL SURVEY OF THE COAST ITSELF AND THE ASCERTAINED POSITION OF THE LIGHT HOUSES AND OTHER DIS TINGUISHABLE OBJECTS WOULD BE THE BASES ANID WHICH WOULD THIEREFORE DEPEND BUT LITTLE ON ANY ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS MADE ON BOARD THE VESSELS EMPLOYED ON THAT PART OF THE WORK BUT THIS IS SUBMITTED TO YOUR CONSIDERATION NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF POINTING OUT ANY PLAN IN PREFERENCE TO ANOTHER BUT ONLY IN ORDER TO SHEW THE VIEW WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN OF THE SUBJECT AND THE DEGREE OF ACCURACY WHICH WE ARE DESI ROUS OF OBTAINING I WILL ONLV ADD THAT THE GREATEST PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH HAVE HERETOFORE OCCURRED RELATE TO WHAT I CALL THE NAUTICAL SURVEY AND ON THAT PART OF THE SUBJECT THE FOLLOWING INQUI RIES HAVE ARISENCAN A CORRECT SURVEY BE TAKEN WITH ONE VESSEL ALONE CAN ANGLES BE TAKEN WITH SUFFICIENT CORRECT NESS FROM ON BOARD A VESSEL SO AS TO ASCERTAIN ITS POSITION IN RELATION TO THREE VISIBLE OBJECTS ON SHORE OR IS IT NECES SARY THAT THE VESSELS POSITIONT AT THE TIME OF TAKING ANY PAR TICULAR SOUNDING SHOULD BE ASCERTAINED BV OBSERVERS ON SHORE AND MANY OTHERS WHICH AN EXAMINATION OF THE SUB JECT WILL NATURALLY SUGGEST TO YOU234 SURVEY OP THE COAST PERMIT ME ALSO TO ASK WHETHER YOU KNOW ANY PERSON WHOM YOU MIGHT RECOMMEND AS CAPABLE OF ACTING IN THE DIF FERENT PARTS OF THE WORK I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE RESPECTFULLY YOUR

PLAN FOR PUCTTING INLTO OPERATION THE SUTRVEY OF THE COAST OJ THE UNITED STATES IN MY GENERAL PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE SURVEY I MEN TIONED THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TWO OBSERVATORIES WOULD BE NECESSARY AND I THIOUGLHT IT PROPER TO PROCURE THE INSTRU MLENTS DESTINED FOR THEM OF SUCHI A QUALITY AND SIZE AS TO BE SUITABLE FOR A PERMANENT NATIONAL ITISTITUTION FOR THIS PURPOSE IT WOULD NOW BE NECESSARY TO ADD ONLY A MURAL CIRCLE AND A ZENITH SECTOR WHICH HOWEVER DESIRABLE I DID NOT VENTURE TO ORDER AS THEIR ABSOLUTE NECESSITY IN CON NEXION WITH THE SURVEY OF THE COAST WAS INOT SO OBVIOUS AS THAT OF THE INSTRUMENTS PROCURED THESE OBSERVATORIES FORM THE FIXED POINTS TO WHICH THE SURVEY AND PARTICULARLY THE NAVAL PART OF IT IS REFERRED THE SELECTION OF PROPER PLACES THE ERECTION OF THIE BUILDINGS AND THE SETTING UP OF THE INSTRUMENTS WILL REQUIRE SOME TIMNE IT WOULD THEREFORE BE DESIRABLE TO BEGIN WITH THIS PART OF THE WENERAL OBSERVATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS THEY WILL BE PER MANENT SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENTS IT WILL BE PROPER TO DECIDE WHETHER THE EXPENSE OF THEIR ERECTION SHALL BE CONMPREHENDED UNDER THOSE OF THIE SURVEY OR BE CONSIDERED AS SEPARATE IT WILL ALSO BE NECESSARY TO DECIDE WHERE THEY SHALL BE ERECTED TO PROCURE THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE FOR THE SURVEY THEIR POSITIONS SHIOULD BE AS FAR NORTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST AS THE VERY FAVOURABLE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES ADMITS THE SAME LOCATION AFFORDS ALSO THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC ADVAN TAGES SUIPPOSING ONE IN THE DISTRICT OF MAINE AND THE OTHER IT LOWER LOUISIANA NEARLY EVERY CELESTIAL PHENOMENON OB SERVALBLE FROM THE TROPIC TO THE ARCTIC CIRCLE AND WITHIN ALBOUT TWO LIUNDRED DEGREES OF DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE COULD BE OBSERVED AT ONE OR OTHIER OF THEM TRHE COMPARISON OF THEIR DISTANCE AND POSITION AS DETERMINIED ASTRONOMICALLY AND GEODESICALLY WOULD OFFER THE MOST RIGOROUS PROOF OF THE SUR242 SURVEY OF THE COAST VEY TLSHE OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THEM COULD BE CORMPARED WITH EACH OTHER SO AS TO RENDER THEMII INDEPENDENT OF FO REIGN OBSERVATORIES STILL VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS MIGHT OC CASION AND FAVOUR THE DESIRE OF PLACING ONE OF THESE OBSER VATORIES IN THE CITY OF WASHINGTON AS OBSERVATORIES ARE PLACED IN THE PRINCIPAL CAPITALS OF EUROPE AS A NATIONAL OBJECT A SCIENTIFIC ORNAMENT AND A MEAUIS OF NOURISHING AN INTEREST FOR SCIENCE IN GENERAL THIS OBSERVATORY WOULD THEN BE THE MOST PROPER PLACE OF DEPOSIT FOR THE STANDARDS OF WEIGHTS AND MLEASURES WHICH MAKE PART OF THE COLLECTION OF INSTRUMNENTS THE OBSERVATORY WILL REQUIRE A CONSTANT OBSERVER THE DUTIES OF WHOM ARE EVIDENT FROM TLHE NATURE OF THE INSTRU MENTS AND THE OBJECT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT VIZ TO MAKE OB SERVATIONS OF EVERY PLHENOMENON LEADING TO THE DETERININA TION OF TIMNE AND LONGITUDE WHEN THE POSITION OF SUCHI AN OBSERVATORY SHALL BE DETERMINED I WILL HAVE THE HONOUR OF SUBMITTING A PLAN OF CONSTRUCTION ADAPTED TO THE OBJECT AND THE LOCALITY THE WOODEN STANDS FOR THE INSTRUMENTS THE BOXES FOR THE BARS TO MEASURE THE BASE LINES AND THE TIN CASES TO MAKE THE PYROMETRICAL EXPERIMENTS WITH BEING OBJECTS OF BULK AND INCONVENIENT TRANSPORTATION I PREFERRED HAVING THEMN MADE IN THIS COUNTRY RHEIR CONSTRUCTION IS NECESSARY TO FIT THE INSTRUMENTS FOR ACTUAL USE AS SOON AS THIS IS DONE I SHOULD PROCEED TO STANDARD THE BARS FOR MEASIURING THE BASES AND TO MAKE THE PYROMETRIC EXPERIMENTS UPON THEM IT WOULD BE VERY DESIRABLE THAT I SHOULD BE AUTHORISED TO MAKE AN EXPENDITURE OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THESE OBJECTS AS WELL AS FOR SIGNAL SPHERES AND LAMPS FOR NIGHT SIGNALS WHICLH I FOUND IT ALSO BETTER TO HLAVE MADE IN THIS COUNTRY ALL THESE PRELIMINARY OBJECTS COULD BE ATTENDED TO THIS WINTER SO AS TO ENABLE ME TO BEGIN NEXT SPRING THE FIRST PART OF THE SURVEY ITSELF VIZ THE RECONNOITERING OF A PART OF THE COAST IN ORDER TO PROJECT A PART OF THE TRIANGLES BEST SUITOF THE UNITED STATES 243 ED FOR ACCURACY AS WELL AS APPROACHING NEAREST TO THE FIGURE OF THE COAST AND TO FIND A PROPER PLACE FOR A BASE LINE TO GROUND THENM UPON IN THIS OPERATION I SHOULD WISH TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A MAN ACQUAINTED WITH THE PART OF THE COUNTRY I SHALL HLAVE TO GO THROUGH AND TO BE ALLOWED AN EXPENDITURE FOR THE TRANS PORTATION OF THE SNMALL INSTRUMENTS THE ERECTION OF TEMPORARY SIGNALS C THIUS PREPARED IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE ACTUJAL INEASUREMENT OF ONE BASE LINE IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SUM MNER OR IN THE FALL OF THE PRESENT YEAR DURING THIS TIMSE THE BUILDING OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE OBSERVATORIES SHOULD BE COM PLETED RHE INSTRUMENTS DESTINED FOR IT COULD THEN BE PUT UP DURING THE WINTER AND THE ADJUSTMENT OF THOSE INTENDED FOR THE SURVEY ITSELF COULD BE MNADE WITH THE NECESSARY AT TENTION ANID MINUTENESS THE WORK OF THE PRINCIPAL SURVEY WILL BE TO FORM A CHAIN OF TRIANGLES WITH SIDES OF ABOUT THIRTV MILES IN LENGTH ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE COAST SO AS TO JOIN THE DISTANT PARTS BY THE SHORTEST AND MOST ACCURATE LINES POSSIBLE AND TO DE TERMINE THE AZIMUTHS OF THE SIDES OF THE TRIANGLES AND THE LATITUIDES AND LONGITUDES OF THEIR ANGULAR POINTS WITHIN THESE A SERIES OF TRIANGLES WITH SIDES OF ABOUT TEN MILES WILL BE FORMED TO JOIN THEM PART OF WHICH IT WILL SOME TIMES BE POSSIBLE TO CARRY ON SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE LARGE ONES THE OBJECT OF THESE WILL BE TO FURNISH AN AMPLE NUM BEIR OF DETERMINED POINTS TO WHICH THE SURVEY MAY BE RE FERRED IN ALL ITS DETAILS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO FURNISH THE CHIEF OPERATOR WITH THE FOLLOWING ASSISTANCE 1 TWO OFFICERS OF THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS WELL INFORTNED IN MATHEMATICS AND WITH SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRACTI CAL OPERATIONS AS WILL ENABLE THEM TO MAKE THE SECONDARY OBSERVATIONS AND TO KEEP THE JOURNAL OF THEM CORRECTLY 2 TWELVE MEN OF THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS MOST OF THENI ARTIFICERS WITH A SERGEANT AND CORPORAL244 SURVEY OF THE COAST 3 ONE BAGGAGE WAGON WITH THE NECESSARY HORSES AND A DRIVER 4 TRENTS AND OTHER FIELD UTENSILS SUIFFICIENT TO ACCOMMO DATE THE PERSONS EMPLOYED AND TO SHELTER THE INSTRUMENTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT THE TENTS FOR THE INSTRUMENTS PARTICULARLY FOR THE PURPOSE 5 IT WOULD BE CONVENIENT AND IN MANY CASES IMPORTANIT THAT A FEW CADETS SHOULD BE ADDED WHO BY FOLLOWING THE WORK WOULD PREPARE THEMSELVES TO TAKE THE STATION OF THE OFFICERS WHEN THEY WOULD BE EMPLOVED IN OPERATING BY THEM SELVES AS WILL BE MENTIONED HEREAFTER THE DUTY OF ONE OF THE OFFICERS WILL BETO ACT AS ASSIS TANT OBSERVER CAPTAIN OF THE MNEN EMPLOYED AND PURSER FOR ALL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO THE TRANSPORTATION OF INSTRU MENTS THE CONSTRUCTION AND ERECTIONI OF SIGNALS AND OTHER SIMILAR OBJECTS FOR THIS PURPOSE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO MAKE A YEARLY APPROPRIATION OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND LOLLARS OF WHICH HE WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN ACCOUNT I SUPPOSE THAT THE SUPPORT OF MEN AND HORSES WILL BE COMLPREHENDED UNDER THE MILITARY EXPENDITURES THE DUTY OF THE SECOND OFFICER WILL BETHAT OF A LIEUTE NANT OF THE SOLDIERS AND OF SECRETARY TO THE OBSERVERS THIS LAST OFFICE IS NECESSARY FOR THE OBSERVATIONS WITHOUT IT IT WOULD BE OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO EXECUTE THEMN WITHIN THE ABSO LUTELY NECESSARY LIMIT OF TIME THE WAGON WILL SERVE TO TRANSPORT THE BAGGAGE PROVI SIONS TENTS SIGNALS TOOLS AND SUCH OF THE INSTRUMENTS AS WILL BEAR THIS MODE OF TRANSPORTATION THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE MEN WILL BETO CARRY THE PRIN CIPAL INSTRUMNENTS FROM STATION TO STATION TO ERECT SIGNALS TO PREPARE THE STATIONS FOR OBSERVATION CLEARING THE WAYS AND VARIOUS SIMILAR WORKS WHICH WILL OCCUR CONSTANITLY IN THE COURSE OF THE SURVEY THIS MODE OF PROCEEDINIG WILL MAKE THE ACTUAL EXPENSES OF THE SURVEY THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE AS THE REQUISITE AID MAY EASILY BE OBTAINED FROM THE ARNMY WITHOUT INTERRUPTINEG ITSOF THE UNITED STATES 245 SERVICE IT WILL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF PREPARING OFFICERS IN AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THEIR EMPLOVMENT AND OF GIVING THEM A KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITIES OF THE COUNTRY BY WHICH THEY NAY BECOME PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN FUTURE THE SURVEY CANNOT BE CARRIED INTO ITS DETAILS UNTIL SUCH A PORTION OF THE ABOVE WORK SHALL BE EXECUTED AND ACTUALLY CALCULATED AS WILL SERVE TO OCCUPY TWO OR THREE DETAIL SUR VEYORS IN A CERTAIN DISTRICT THE SAME IS TO BE OBSERVED WITH RESPECT TO THE NAUTICAL SURVEY WHICH IS TO EXTEND FROMN THE COAST AS FAR AS ANY OB JECT IMPORTANT TO NAVIGATION MAY OCCUR IT WILL BE MOST PRO PER TO USE IN THESE PARTS OF THE WORK WELL INFORMED OFFICERS LBROUGHT UP AT THE MILITARY ACADEMY AND NAVAL OFFICERS IT WAS THIE INITENTION OF MR GALLATIN TO DIVIDE THE WHOLE WORK INTO TWO PARTS IF THAT SHOULD BE THE WISH NOW TWO CORPS OF SURVEYORS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD BE REQUIRED AS THE GENERAL CHAIN OF GREAT TRIANGLES NMUST HOWEVER FORNM ONE SINGLE SYSTEM IT MLAY BE FOUND PROPER NOT TO MAKE THIS DIVISION UNTIL A PART OF THESE ARE DONE AND WHEN THE SECONDARV TRIANGLES BEING MORE NUMEROUS WILL REQUIRE AN INCREASE OF THE NUMBER OF OBSERVERS SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE WORK MAY BE ADVANTAGEOUSLY MADE AS THE PRINCIPAL WORK IS PROCEEDING WHEN IT NMIGLHT BE DIVIDED INTO SUCH A NUMNBER AS THE LOCALITIES WOULD INDI CATE THUS FOR INSTANCE THE COAST OF LOUISIANA BEING BY ITS GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COAST OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD OF ITSELF FORM SUCH A SUBDIVISION ROBERT PATTERSON ESQ DIRECTOR OF THE MINT IN PHILADEL PHIA HAS FROM THE HEGINNING BEEN APPOINTED GENERAL SU PERINTENDANT OF THIS WORK IN HIM TLLE CORRESPONDENCE ANID GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS RELATIVE TO IT HAVE BEEN MIADE TO CENTRE THIS PART OF THE ARRANGETNENT IS THEREFORE CONSIDLERED AS FIXED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE PRESENT PLAN WHICH IS INTENLED MERELY TO COMPREHEND THIE WAYS AND MEANS FOR PUTTING THE SURVEY ITSELF INTO OPERATION VOL IIK 2246 SURVEY OF THE COAST ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS OF MR GALLATIN THE COLLECTION OF INSTRUMENTS IS MIIADE SUFFICIENT TO FURNISH TEMPORARILY THE NECESSARY INSTRUMENTS FOR A LETERINIIATION OF BOUNDARY LINES IF THEREFORE ANY SUCH WORK IS NOW IN CONTEMPLATION THE INSTRUMNENTS FOR IT MUAY BE SUIPPLIED FROM THE COLLECTION F

STANDARDING THE DOUBLE METRE BARS REQUIRED ANOTHER APPARATUS WHICH I HAD CONSTRUCTED FOR THIE PURPOSE IT MAY BE SAID TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CULT A BAR PERPENDICU LARLY TO ITS LENGTH BY LHAND WITH THE ACCURACY REQUIRED TRHJE TOOL IN QUESTION IS INTENDED FOR THIS PURPOSE TRHE FOLLOWING ARE ITS PRINCIPAL PARTS A PLATE OF CAST IRON ABOUT EIGHT INCLHES BROAD AND TWO FEET AND A HALF LONG EXACTLY EVEN AND SMOOTH IS ADJUSTED BY SCREWS FROM BELOW UPON A STRONG IRON FRAME AT ONE END OF WHICH TWO PIECES DIRECT IN A PERPENDICULAR SLIDE THE SOCKET PIECE WHICH RECEIVES THE AXIS OF A CIRCULAR FILE OF ABOUT THREE INCHES IN DIAMETER TO WHICLH THE ABOVE PLATE IS ADJUSTED SO AS TO MAKE THE BAR LAID UPON THIS PLATE AND PRESENTED TO THE FILE EXACTLY PERPENDICULAR TO IT A STRONG IRON BAR IS MADE TO SLIDE OVER THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE PLATE BY MEANS OF TWO HORIZONTAL SCREWS THE BAR TO BE FILED BEING LAID UPON THE PLATE AND AGAINST THIS BAR A TRIAL OF FILING IN TWO INVERTED POSITIONS WILL SHOW ANY DEFECT OF ADJUSTMENT DOUI BLE THE ADJUSTMENT MUST BE MADE ACCORDINGLY AND THE SURFACE OF THE CUT WILL BE PERFECTLY EVEN THERE IS A CHANGE OF FILES OF DIFFERENT FINENESS AND FOR THE LAST A TURKEY STONE WHICHI WILL TAKE OFF ALL THE MARKS OF THE FILE AND GRIND THE SURFACE SMOOTH WHEN ONLY ONE BAR IS TO BE STANDARDED THIS TOOL NMUST BE USED THROUGHOUT WITH ITS DIFFERENT FILES AND THE TURKEY STONE LAST BUT AS I HAD FOUX EQUAL BARS TO STANDARD AT ONCE AND COULD MAKE THE PLANES OF THEIR ENDS MORE PERFECT IN CONSEO4 THE UNITED STATES 257 QUENCE OF THE GREAT SURFACE THEY PRESENTED WHEN JOINED TO GETHER I PROCEEDED SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY FOR THE LAST FINISHIING RTHE BARS WERE GUAGED AS NEARLY AS THE WORKMAN IN LON DON COULD DO IT TO THE BREADTH AND THICKNESS OF THE METRES OF THE COMMITTEE AND MADE SEVEN FEET FOUR INCHES LONG THE DDUBLE METRE BEING ONLY ABOUT SIX FEET SEVEN INCHES THERE WERE NINE INCTHES TO BE CUT OFF WHICH ALLOWED ME TO MAKE CHOICE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE BARS FOR THE CUTS AND TO AVOID THE PARTS NEAR THE ENDS WHICH ARE NEVER EQUALLY WELL GUAGED BECAUSE THE TOOLS WHICH THEY ARE WORKED WITH LOSE THERE THIEIR STEADY SUPPORT AND FALL OFF THE PIECES SO CUT OFT WERE BESIDES WANTED FOR MAKING THE BUTTING PIECES FOR THESE BARS AND THE METRES IN THE CONMPARISONS AND FOR THE FINAL ADJUSTMETNT OF THESE BARS AS WILL BE SHOWN HERE AFTER THE BARS WERE LETTERED A B C D FOR THE CONVE NIENCE OF REGISTERING THEM AFTER THEIR FIRST CUTTING THERE WAS ENOUGH LEFT IN LENIGTH FOR THE PERPENDICULAR FILING TO BRINGR TLHENI AS NEARLY AS POSKSIBLE TO AN EQUAL BREADTH AND THICKNESS

COURSE PER PENDICULAR IN THIS POSITION THEY WERE AGAIN FASTENED AS BEFORE AND RUBBED AGAIN WITLH THE SEVEN INCH BUTTING PIECE CHANGING THEIR RELATIVE POSITION UNTIL THEV PRESENTED AT THESE ENDS ALSO ONE UNIFORM REGULAR SURFACE AND SHARP TOP LINE THE TWO IRON METRES OF THE COMMITTEE AND LENOIR WERE THEN LAID UPON THEM AND APPEARED TO COINCIDE WITH THEM IN LENGTH THIS WAS OF COURSE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES WISHIING HOWEVER TO SUFFER THEM TO BE SOTMEWHAT LONGER BECAUSE THE COOLING DOWN OF THE METAL WHICH IS ALWAVS MORE OR LESS HEATED BY THE WORKING WILL ALWAYS SHORTEN THEM SOMEWHAT INDEED I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE COPIES OF MEASURES MADE IN THIS WAY ARE GENERALLY SHORTER THAN THEIR ORIGINALS FIOTN THIS CIRCUMNSTANCE THEIR CONMPARISON BEING PROBABLY MADE TOO SOON AFTER THE WORK AND BEFORE THE METAL IS ACTUALLY COOLED DOWN TO THIE TEMPERATURE OF THE ORIGINAL WITH WHICH THEY ARE COMPAREDOF THE UNITED STATES 259 FOR THE ACTUAL COMPARISON OF THE METRES AND THESE BARS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PLACE THEM ON THE WORK BENCH ON WHICH THE ABOVE LESCRIBED COMPARATOR AND ENGLISH BRASS SCALE WERE AT THE EXACT HEIGHT WLICH WOULD BRING THEIR UPPER SURFACE WITHOUT PARALLAXTO THE FOCI OF THE MICROSCOPES WHICH WERE OF COURSE ADJUSTED FOR THE DIVISIONS OF THE SCALE THE INFLU CNCE OF UNEQUALLY SUPPORTING THE STANDARD BARS BY MERELY LAYING SOMNETLLING UNDLER THEM AT DIFFERENT PLACES BEING GREAT I CAUSED PINE RULES TO BE MADE OF SUFFICIENT BREADTH AND LENGTH AND OF TTHE EXACT THICKNESS REQUIRED FOR EACH STAND ARD UPON THESE EACH STANDARD WAS LAID TOGETHER WITH ITS PIOPER BUTTING PIECES WHEN UNDER COMPARISON AS IT IS WHOLLY INADMISSIBLE TO TAKE THE EDGE OF A BAR AS AN OBJECT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPA RISON BECAUSE IT NEVER GIVES A GOOD IMAGE THE SHORTER PIECES CUT FROM THE BARS FROM TWO TO FOUR INCHES IN LENGTH WERE FILED ON THE TOOL IN THE MANNER OF THE BUTTING PIECES ABOVE DESCRIBED BROUGHT TO THE EXACT TLHICKNESS OF THE STANDARD WITH WHICH THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE USED AND THEN THE BUTT ING FACES OF THEM RUBBED AGAINST EACH OTHER WITH EMERY AND OIL UPON THE IRONI PLATE OF THE FILING TOOL CONSTANTLY INVERTING THEIR POSITIONS UNTIL SUCH A PERFECT CONTACT WAS OBTAINED THAT THE LINE FORMED BY IT WAS NOT SO THICK AS ONE OF THE DI VISIONS OF THE SCALE TRHESE PIECES WERE ALWAYS LAID AGAINST THE ENDS OF THE STANDARD UNDER COMPARISON SO THAT THE JUNCTION APPEARED LIKE A LINE DRAWN UPOIL THE STANDARD WITH WHICH THE CROSS WIRES OF THE NMICROMETER WERE MADE TO INTERSECT THE MI CROSCOPES WERE FURNISHED WITH REFLECTORS FORMED OF WHITE PAPER PLACED IN A POSITION INCLINING FORWARDS BETWEEN THE MICROSCOPES AND THEIR SUPPORTS BY THESE THE LIGHT WAS REFLECTED UPON THE SCALE OR THE STANDARDS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DIVISION LINIES AS REQUIRED FOR ACCURATE READING TO PREVENT THE HEAT OF MY BODY FROM HAVING ANY INFLUENCE ON THE SCALE AND APPARATUS A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER WAS NAILED TO THE WORK BENCH NEAR THE MICROSCOPES AND I WORKED WITH GLOVES ON260 SURVEY OF THE COAST FROM SEVEN TO TWELVE THERMOMETERS WERE LAID CONSTANTLY OVER THE SCALE AND THE STANDARDS AND WERE READ AT PROPER INTERVALS OF TIME TRHE WORK BENCH ITSELF WAS ABOUT DOUBLE THE LENGTH OF THE SCALE IT WAS ACCURATELY ADJUSTED BEFORE THE WORK AND THE SCALE WAS SO PLACED WITH RESPECT TO THE WINDOWS OF THE ROOM THAT THE MICROSCOPES RECEIVED THEIR LIGHT FROM SEPARATE WIN DOWS THE BENCH WAS MADE OF TWO PLANKS TLHREE INCLHES TLICK PLACED AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER SO THAT A TRANSVERSE SECTION WAS IN THE FORM OF THE LETTER T THE TOP PLANK WAS ABOUT TWELVE INCHES BROAD AND THE WLHOLE RESTED ONI SIX LEGS NO FIRE WAS KEPT IN THE ROOM WLILE THE COMPAR ISONS WERE NMAKING AND FOR SOME TINME BEFORE THE WINDOWS WERE LEFT OPEN DAY AND NIGHT TO KEEP THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM IN AN EQUAL TEMPERATURE BEING THAT OF THE SURROUNDING AT MOSPHERE FOR THE COMPARISONS INTENDED TO BE MADE IN ONE DAY EVERY THING WAS PREPARED THE DAV BEFORE AND LEFT IN SUCLH A STATE AS TO REQUIRE AS LITTLE HANDLING AS POSSIBLE THIS WAS DONE IN ORDER THAT THE PARTS OF THE APPARATUS MIGLHT ACQUIRE THROUGHOUT AN EQUAL TENIPERATURE ALL THESE PRECAUTIONS WERE NECESSARY TO OBTAIN SATISFAC TORY RESULTS AS IS WELL KNOWN TO MEN IN THE PRACTICE OF SUCH OPERATIONS THE PROBABLE ERROR IN THE MICROSCOPIC READINGS MAY HE CONSIDERED AS INCREASING WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE READINGS HAVING FOUR MNETRES AND THE SCALE BEING SUFFICIENT TO TAKE IN TWO I HAD THE MEANS OF DIMINISHING THIS ERROR ONE HALF BY CONMPARINIG TWO AT A TIME INSTEAD OF ONIE AN EQUATION BE TWEEN THE RESULTS THLEN ENABLED ME TO OBTAIN THE VALUE OF EACH METRE THIS METHOD HIAD THE ADVANTAGE OF REMOVING EVERY PREJUDICE FROM THE MIND OF THE OBSERVER IN REGARD TO THE READINGS IN AS MUCH AS THE COMBINATION OF THE DIFFE RENT MEASURES AND THE DIFFERENT INFLUIENCE OF TEMPERATURE OCCASIONED A VARIATION WHICH COMPLETELY PRECLUDED PREVIOUS ESTIMNATESOF THE UNITED STATES 26 T TO PREPARE FOR READIING THE MICROSCOPES WERE PLACED OVER THE DECIMALS WHICH ON THE SCALE CORRESPONDED TO THE LENGTH OF TWO METRES VIZ 787 OR 788 AND THIS DISTANCE WAS TAKEN FROM  T TO 798 WHICLH BROUGHT IT EQUIDISTANT FROIN BOTH ENDS OF THIE SCALE THE MICROSCOPES WERE FIXED TO THIS DISTANCE UPON THE SCALE WITH THE GREATEST CARE WERE THEN LEFT FOR SOME TIME AND WETRE AGAIN VERIFIED TLHE SCALE WAS REMOVED AND THE TWO METRES WITH THEIR SUPPORTS PRO PERLV LAID IN ITS PLACE SO AS TO BRING THE MIDDLE OF THEIR BREADTH UNDER THE FACES OF THE MICROSCOPES THE MIDDLE CONTACT WAS EXACTLV MADE THE BUTTING PIECES LAID TO BOTH ENDS THE COINCIDENCE OF THE END UNDER THE MICROSCOPE WITH FIXED WIRES EFFECTED THE MIDDLE CONTACT AGAIN VERIFIED WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS THE MOVEABLE WIRES OF THE MICROMETER MLIICROSCOPE MOVED BY THE MICROMETER SCREW UPON THE IMNAGE OF THE CONTACT UNDER ITS FOCUS AND THE VALUE OF THE CORRE SPONLDING SUBDIVISIONS READ ON THE MICROMETER BY ITS REVO LUTIONS AND SUBDIVISIONS THE LONGITUDINAL MOTION REQUIRED TO EFFECT THE CONTACT CAN NOT BE CONMMUNICATED BY THE HAND ALONE THE BEST MODE OF COMMNUNICATING THIS MNOTION IS BY A FEW LIGHT STROKES OF A SUITABLE PIECE OF WOOD APPLIED CAREFULLY AND IN SUCH A MATN NER AS NOT TO SEPARATE THE DIFFERENT PIECES BY THE COUNTER STROKE RPHE VALUE OF THIE MICROMETER PARTS WAS ASCERTAINED BY RE PEATED MEASUREMENTS OF A DECIMAL IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SCALE FROM A MEAN OF MANY SUCH MEASUREMENTS WITH THE ADJUSTMENT

INTO SUCH DETAILVS OF DESCRIPTION AS MUST BE CONSIDERED GENEITALLY KNOWN THE ABOVE IS I BELIEVE SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAINI ALL THE PECULIATITIES OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND TO DETAIL THEIR PRINCIPLES AND USE METHODS OF OBSERVTING WITH THE TWOFEET THEODOLITE THE LIMITS ASSIGNED TO THE PRESENT PAPERS RENDERED IT NE CESSARY IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS INSTRUMENT TO SUPPOSE THAT A GENERAL IDEA OF IT MIGHT BE OBTAINED FROM THE FIGURES THERE GIVEN THE SAME REASON NOW COMPELS ME TO CONSIDER THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND METHOD OF LEVELLING IT TOGETHER WITH THE ADJUSTMENT OF ITS LINE OF COLLIMATION AND AXIS AS WELL KNOWN AND TO CONFINE MYSELF TO THE EXPLANATION OF ITS PE CULIAR PROPERTIES AND OF SOME THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRAC TICAL ADVANTAGES NOT HITHERTO TREATED OF AT LEAST TO MY KNOW LEDGE AN OBSERVER FURNISHED WITH AN INSTRUIMENT WITH WHICLH HE HAS NEVER OBSERVED SHOULD FIRST ASCERTAIN ITS PROPERTIES AND DEFECTS FROM THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES ON WHICH IT IS CONSTRUCTED TRHIS WILL BE MORE INDISPENSABLE WHEN THE IN STRUMENT HAS HAD TO UNDERGO TRANSPORTATION IN THIS INQUIRV HE WILL BE MUCH ASSISTEDIF BESIDES HISOF THE UNITED STATES 295 GENERAL SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE HLE IS ACQUAINTED

THE EXECUTION OF THE INSTRUMENT HE WILL BE ABLE TO DIRECT HIS INQUIRY SOONER TO A SATISFACTORY RESULT IN AN INSTRUMENT WHICH IS AS PERFECT AS POSSIBLE THE AD JUSTINENTS ARE OF COURSE ONLY ACCURATE WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS AND HE HAS TO GUARD AGAINST THE ERRORS WHICH HIE NMAY BE LIA BLE TO IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEM AS VELL AS AGAINST TLHOSE OF THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF IT BECOMES TLHEREFORE THE DUTY OF AN ACCURATE OBSERVER IN NO CASE TO RELY MERELY UPON THE ACCURACY OF HIS INSTRUMENIT AND HIS OWN SKILL BUT TO ADOPT SUCH A METHOD OF OBSERVING AS WILL COUINTERACT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TLE ERRORS OF THE INSTRU NIENT ANDW THOSE TO WHICH HE HINMSELF IS LIABLE IN MAKING HIS OBSERVATIONS WITHOUT SUCLL A METHOD AND A REGULAR SYSTEM IN HIS OBSER VATIONS HIS MEAN RESULTS WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HA ZARD AND MAY EVEN BE RELIDERED USELESS BY ADDING AN O1 SERVATION WHICLH WOULD REPEAT AN ERROR ALREADY INCLUDED IN ANOTHER OBSERVATION IT IS POSSIBLE TO CORRECT ANGLES MEASURED BY AN INCORRECT OR ILL ADJUSTED INSTRUMENT BY INATHEMATICAL FORMULH WHEN THE DATA FOR THE REDUICTION ARE EXACTLY KNOWN BUT SUCLH DATA ARE ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN WITH SUFFICIENT ACCURACY THE REDUCTIONS REQUIRE LONGER CALCULATIONS THAN THE OBSER VATIONS THEMNSELVES OR AT LEAST ARE MORE TEDIOUS THAN A RE PETITION OF THIE OBSER VATIONS IN A WORK OF GREAT EXTENT THESE REDUCTIONS OCCUR SO FREQUENTLV AND THE CALCULATIONS OF THE OBSERVATIONS ARE AT THE SAME TIME SO NUMEROUS AS TO RENDER ANY METLHOD IN WHICH IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO RETAIN THEM EXTRENMELV LABORIOUS ON THE OTTHER HAND THE OBSERVATIONS MAV ALWAYS BE REPEATED IN A WAY IN WHICH THESE CORRECTIONS WILL COMPENSATE EACH OTHER AS TO THE INSTRUMENT INTENDED FOR THE SURVEY WHICH IS THE296 SURVEY OF THE COAST SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT PAPERS I BAD REASON TO ENTERTAIN THE HIGHEST EXPECTATIONS IT WAS EXECUTED UNDER MY OWN IN SPECTION BY THAT DISTINGUISHED ARTIST MR EDWARD TROUGHTON OF LONDON AGREEABLY TO OUR UNITED VIEWS AND WITH THAT IN TEREST FOR ITS SUCCESS WHICH THE GREAT FRIENDSHIP WITH WHICH HE WAS PLEASED TO FAVOUR MIE COULD ALONE INSPIRE THE ACTUAL OPERATIONS MADE AT A STATION OF A SURVEY ON SOLID GROUND IN A PROPER PLACE WITH GOOD SIGNALS 5C ARE IN EVERY RESPECT BEST ADAPTED FOR THE TRIAL OF THE INSTRUMENTS AND FOR DEVISING A PROPER METHOD OF OBSERVING WITH THEM FROM THE REMARKS WHICH WILL BE FOUND IN THEIR PROPER PLACE ON THE NMETHOD OF DIVIDING USED IN ENGLAND IT MAY BE OBSERVED AND HAS BEEN OBSERVED ALREADY BY RAMSDEN IN DE SCRIBING HIS DIVIDING ENGINE THAT THE EXACT PLACING OF THE AXIS IN THE CENTRE OF THE DIVISION IS

THE PLANE OF THE CIRCLE WILL BE PLACED IN THE SAME SYMMETRICAL POSITIONS WITH RESPECT TO ANY ANGLE MEASURED UPON IT AS WAS THE CASE IN THE READINGS OF THE ANGLE AND THE ANGLES WILL REQUIRE SUCCESSIVE

IN ARITLINE TICAL PROGRESSION LITNITED BY THE SUMN OF THE OS BEING EQUAL TO THIE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE WHICH MAKES THEIR SUM 0 AND PROVES THE INDISCRIMINATE MEAN OF THE ANGLES OB SERVED IN THE SYMMETRIC POSITIONS OF THE INSTRUMENT TO BE THE ACCURATE HORIZONTAL ANGLE IN AN ECCENITRIC INSTRUMENT IT IS OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE NMICROSCOPES MEASURE EXACTLY IN ALL PARTS OF TTHE DIVISION BUT THE ABOVE SHOWS THAT IF THEY ARE ADJUSTED IN ANY ONE POSITION THEIR MEASURE WILL BE CORRECTED BY THIE CLHANGES OF POSITION OF THE INSTRUMENT WITHOUT HAVING RE COURSE TO ANY OTHER NMEANS ERRORS NAY ALSO ARISE FROM A WANT OF HORIZONTALITY IN THE AXIS OF TLHE INSTRUMENT IT IS PROPER TLHEREFORE TO ADAPT THE MTETHOD OF OBSERVING SO AS TO CORRECT THESE ERRORS BUT SUCH ERRORS ARE EASILY CORRECTED IN THIS INSTRUMENT BY OBSERVING WITH THE TELESCOPE IN TWO POSITIONS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE TO EACLH OTHLER IN PLATE VI FIG 2 LET AB BE THE HORIZONTAL LINE IN WHICH THE AXIS SHOULD BE AND TP THE SECTION OF THE TRUE VERTICAL PLANE WHICH THE TELESCOPE SHOULD DESCRIBE INSTEAD OF THIS LET THE AXIS BE INCLINED IN ONE POSITION OF THE INSTRUNMENT SO THAT THE TELESCOPE MOVES ROUND THE LINE AB AND DESCRIBES A CIRCLE MAKING WITH THE VERTICAL AN ANGLE TOTACABCB ALL THE RESULTS OF OBSERVATIONS ON OBJECTS TAKEN IN THIS PLANE WILL REQUIRE A REDUCTION CORRESPONDING TO THIS ANGLE TURNING THE TELESCOPE SO AS TO REVOLVE THROUGH A SEMICIRCUMFERENCE HO RIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY AND OBSERVING THE SAME OBJECTS ACGAIN WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF THLE ADJUSTMENTS OF THE TRANSIT THE AXIS WILL COME IN THE DIRECTION AB AND THE PLANE OF REVOLUTION OF THE TELESCOPE WILL MAKE WITH THE VERTICAL THE ANGLE TCT TCT BUT ON THE SIDE EXACTLY OPPOSITE ALL RESULTS OF OB SERVATIONS WILL REQUIRE EXACTLY THE SAME CORRECTION AS BEFORE IN RESPECT TO QUIANTITY BUT THEY WILL BE NEGATIVE IN RESPECT TO THE FORMER AND THE INDISCRIMINATE MEAN OF THE TWO WILL BE VOL IIR 2302 SURVEY OF THE COAST AS BEFORE THE TRUE ANGLE BETWEEN THE VERTICALS OF THE OBSERVED OBJECTS THIS OPERATION WILL BESIDES BRING THE LHORIZONTAL ANGLE EX ACTLY TO THE POINTS OF THE CIRCLE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE TO THE FORMNER AND WILL AGAIN ACT AS A CORRECTION IN THE SAME SENSE AS THE TWO MLENTIONED BEFORE AN ERROR IN THE LINE OF COLLIMATION WILL OF COURSE COMBINE WITH THAT OF THE VERTICALITY OF THE CIRCLE DESCRIBED BY THE TELES COPE ANID BE CORRECTED LARTIALLY BY THE DOUBLE OPERATION BUT THIS ADJUSTMENT IS EASILY VERIFIED IN THIS INSTRUMENT AN IRIEGULARITY IN THE AXES OF MOTION OF THE INSTRUMENT WOULD OF COURSE HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE OBSERVATIONS BUT IN THE HORIZONTAL ANGLES IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS INFLUENCE WOULD BE DESTROYED BY TLHE EXACTLY INVERTED POSITIORS OF THE INSTRUMENT IN WHICH THE OBSERVATIONS ARE MADE THIS ERROIO THEREFORE FALLS IN WITH ALL THE OTHERS WHICH APPEAR OF COURSE ALWAYS COMBINED AND ARE FINALLY COMPENSATED BY A CERTAIN DETERMINED NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS SYSTETNATICALLY AR RANIGED THE ONLY CAUSE OF ERROR STILL REMAINING IS THIE ACCIDENTAL ERROR OF ANY PARTICULAR DIVISION WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED IN THE SERIES OF ANGLES RHIS CHANCE CAN OCCUR ONLY BY SOME PARTICULAR ACCIDENT IN THE WORK AS THE DIVIDING ENGINE OF MR TROUGHTON IS SO REGULAR AND HIS ATTENTION AND CARE SO GREAT THAT THE ERROR OF THE DIVISION MAY BE SUPPOSED A MINIMUM THE DISPLACEMENT OF MY MICROSCOPES FROM THEIR EXACT DISTANCE OF 1200 WAS TOO SMALL TO PRODUCE ANY INFLUENCE ON THE ACCURACY OF THE COMPENSATIONS TTPON THE PRINCIPLES HERE DEMONSTRATED I GROUNDED THE FOLLOWING METHOD OF OBSERVING ALL HORIZONTAL ANGLES WITH THE TWOFEET THEODOLITE 1 HAVING CAREFUILLY ADJUSTED THE INSTRUMENT INMALL RESPECTS THE TELESCOPE IS PLACED IN SUCH A POSITION AS TO BRING ITS EVE END PERPENDICULARLY OVER THE MICROSCOPE A IN THIS PNSI TION WHICH I CALL DIRECT I OBSERVE ALL THE OBJECTS BETWEEN WHICH I INTEND TO DETERMINE THE ANGLES AT THE TIMRE 2 THEN I TURN THE TELESCOPE ROUND VERTICALLY SO AS TOOF THE UNITED STATES 303 BRING THE OBJECT END OF IT PERPENDICULARLY OVER THE MICROS COPE A WHICH POSITION 1 CALL REVERSED AND OBSERVE THE SAME OBJECTS WHICH I HAD OBSERVED BEFORE WITHOUT ANY AL TERATION1 IN THE ADJUSTMENTS OF THE INSTRUMENT NOT EVEN ITS GENERAL LEVELLING IF THERE LHAS BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL DERANGE MENT BUT IN EVERY CASE WITHOUT ANY ALTERATION WHATEVER IN THE ADJUSTMENTS OF THE TRANSIT TELESCOPE 3 THENI THE THEODOLITE ITSELF IS TURNED ROUND HORIZONTALLY FOR ONE CHANGE OF LEGS OR ABOUT 1200 SO THAT ALL ANGLES WILL NOW BE READ BY EACH MICROSCOPE AT I2O0 FROM THE FOR MER SITUATION IN THIS POSITION THE INSTRUMENT IS AGAIN CARE FLLLY LEVELLED AND ADJUSTED IN ALL RESPECTS 4 IN THIS SECOND POSITION THE TWO OPERATIONS BEFORE DE SCRIBED ARE REPEATED  THAT IS THE SAME OBJECTS ARE AGAIN OB SERVED IN BOTH THE DIRECT AND THE REVERSED POSITION OF THE TRANSIT 5 AFTER THIS THE THEODOLITE IS AGAIN NMOVED HORIZONTALLY FOR ONE CHANGE OF LEGS IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS BEFORE SO AS TO COME INTO THE THIRD POSSIBLE SITUATION AND EACH MICROS COPE TO READ AGAIN ON THE LIMB AT 1200 FROM ITS FORMER SITU ATION 6 IN THIS THIRD POSITION THE SAME OBJECTS ARE AGAIN OB SERVED BOTH IN THE DIRECT AND IN THE REVERSED POSITION OF THE TRANSIT AFTER THE INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN ADJUSTED IN ALL RESPECTS AS IN ANY ONE OF THE TWO FORMER POSITIONS BY THIS METHOD EACH ANGLE IS OBSERVED SIX TIMES IN THE SYSTENATIC ORDER REQUIRED FOR THLE COMPENSATION OF ALL ERRORS ARISING FROM THE CAUSES LHERETOFORE TREATED AND WITH MUCLH LESS TROUBLE THAN IF AN EQUAL NUMNBER OF OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE BY THE MERELY ACCIDENTAL POSITIONS OF THE INSTRUMENT AND AS MANY OBSERVATIONS WOULD MOST PROBABLY BE TAKEN AT ALL EVENTS OF SUCH POINTS AS WOULD BE CONSIDERED AS REQUIRING GREAT ACCURACY THLLE FINIAL ANGLES ARE THUS DETERMINED BY THE INFLUENCE OF EIGHTEEN ANGLES ON PARTS OF THE DIVISION SYM METRICALLY SITUATED EXPERIENCE HAS COMPLETELY SANCTIONED THIS METHOD OF OB 2804 SURVEY OF THE COAST SERVING BY AN ACCURACY IN THE FINAL RESULTS NEVER OBTAINED WITHOUT IT I MUST HIERE OBSERVE IN RELATION TO THE ACTUAL APPLICATION OF TBIS NMETHOD OF OBSERVING IN NMY TRIANIGULATION FOR THE SUR VEY OF THE COAST THAT IT WILL NOT BE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN RI GOROUSLY FOLLOWED BECAUSE IT WAS THE RESULT RATHER THAN THE ELEMNENT OF THAT PART OF TLE WORK WHICH I COULD EXECUTE THE NECESSITY OF ADVANCING IN THE WORK AT THE SAMNE TIME THAT I WAS BRINGING MY METHOD OF OBSERVING TO PERFECTION BOTH BY THEORETICAL RESEARCHES AND BY PRACTICE CAUSED MIIE TO NMAKE USE OF ALL THE OBSERVATIONS OBTAINED FOR BOTH PURPOSES IN THE EXAMPLES OF THE DAYBOOK AND THE JOURNAL OF RE SULTS INSERTED AT THE END OF THE PAPER WILL BE SEEN SOME FULLY REGISTERED IN PROPER ORDER THESE ARE TAKEN FROM THE WORK ON THE BOUNDARY LINE WITH CANADA AS I HAD NOT THE OPPOR TUNITY OF REFERRING TO ANV OF MY JOURNALS FROM THE SURVEY HAVING DELIVERED THEM TO THE WAR DEPARTMENT THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE AZIMUTHS OF CELESTIAL BODIES PAR TICULARLY OF THE SUN ARE VERY ACCURATE AND EASY WITH THIS IN STRUMENT THEY SHOULDL UNITE IN ONE FINAL RESULT A COMNPLETE SYSTEM OF THE ABOVE COMPENSATING METHOD OF OBSERVING BE SIDES AN EQUAL NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS MADE SIX HOURS BEFORE AND AFTER THE TRANSIT OF THE LHEAVENLY BODY USED RHIS COM BINATION IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO RENDER THLE ELEMENTS FOR THE CALCULATIONS OF THE AZIMUTHS COMPENSATING TO EACH OTHER AND THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR ERROR THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE AS WELL AS TO MAKE THE OBSERVATIONS THE MOST FAVOURABLE AND ACCU RATE A FULL RESULT OF AZIMUTHS MUST THEREFORE CONSIST OF TWELVE OBSERVATIONS WHICH IS NOT MORE THAN THE NUMBER WHICH WOULD OF CHOICE BE GIVEN TO THIS ELEMENT OF THE TRIANGULATION WITH RESPECT TO THE INSTRUMENT IT WILL BE THE MEAN OF THIRTYSIX ANGLES SYMMETRICALLY SITUATED UPON THE CIRCLE SO THAT THE ACCURACY THUS OBTAINED MUST PROVE VERY SATISFACTORY IN CASE THAT THIS COMPLETE SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS CANNOT BE OH TAINED ON A STATION THE ONLY CORRECTION WHICH MAY BE OMIT TED IS THAT OF THE CHANGE OF THE THEODOLITE UPON ITS LEGS ALLOP THE UNITED STATES 305 THE OTHERS ARE COMPLETELY INDISPENSABLE FOR OBTAINING A SA TISFACTORY RESULT IN OBSERVING THE CELESTIAL BODY ITS TRANSIT IS OBSERVED ON ALL THE THREE VERTICAL WIRES OF THE TELESCOPE AND WHEN THE SUN IS OBSERVED WHICH IS THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS OF ALL FOR AZINMUTH DETERNMINATIONS THE CONTACTS OF BOTH LIMBS ARE TAKEN BY THIS MODE OF OBSERVING WHICH IS VERY EASY AND EVEN VERY PLEASANT WITH THIS INSTRUMENT THE MOST ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE AZIMUTHS THE TIME IS OBSERVED SIX TIMES WITH THE SUN FOR EACH OBSERVATION WHICH IS OF COURSE A GREAT ADVANTAGE AS TO ACCURACY I SHOULD EVEN HAVE WISHED THAT THE TELESCOPE HAD FIVE VERTICAL WIRES INSTEAD OF THREE THE FOLLOWING IS THE ORDER WHICH I FOLLOWED IN SUCH AN OBSER VATION HAVING CAREFULLY VERIFIED ALL THE ADJUSTMENTS OF THE INSTRU MENT AND THE TELESCOPE BEING IN THE POSITION WHICH I HAVE CALLED DIRECT I OBSERVEDFIRST THE TERRESTRIAL OBJECT WITH WHICH THIE AZIMUTH WAS TO BE TAKEN CHOOSINGFOR IT THE SIGNAL WHICH BY ITS ILLUMINATION AT THE TIME APPEARED THE MOST DISTINCT AND IN CASE OF EQUALITY IN THIS RESPECT THAT NEAREST TO THE SUN AND READ OFFT THE THREE MICROSCOPES THEN I TURNED THE TELESCOPE HORIZONTALLY SO AS TO RECEIVE THE TRANSIT OF BOTH LIMBS OF THE SUN AT ALL THE THREE VERTICAL WIRES AND HAVING CLAMPED THE TELESCOPE IN THIS POSITION I OBSERVED THESE TRAN SITS THE TINE OF EACH BEING CATEFUILLY OBSERVED BV A CHRONO METER OR CLOCK TO SECONDS AND DECIMAHG AND WRITTEN IN THE DAYBOOK BY THIE SECRETARY AFTER THIS I READ THE THREE NMI CROSCOPES ON THE CIRCLE THEN I PLACED THE TELESCOPE IMMEDIATELY IN THE REVERSED POSITION AND OLBSERVED THE TRANSIT OF THE SUN AGAIN AS BEFORE AND AFTER IT THE SAME TERRESTRIAL OBJECT AGAIN BY THIS METHIOD THE TWO AZIMUTHS ARE OBSERVED THE NEAR EST POSSIBLE TO EACLH OTHER AND THE TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS OBSERV ED CORRESPOND TO EACH POSITION OF THE TRANSIT IF THE CIRCUNMSTANCES ALLOW ONE MORE AZIMUTH TO HE TAKEN WITHOUT HOWEVER ADMITTINOG THE CHLANGE OF THE INISTRUMENT UPON ITS LEGS AND AN ASSISTANT BE AT HAND TO DETERNIIUIE THE306 SURVEY OP THE COAST TIME BY THE CHRONOMETER OR CLOCK WITHOUT TAKING THE OB SERVER AWAY FROM THE AZIMUTH THEN THE ABOVE SECOND OB SERVATION OF THE TERRESTRIAL OBJECT IN THE REVERSED POSITION OF THE TRANSIT CAN BE FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY ONE OF THE SUN IN THE SAME POSITION OF THE TRANSIT AND RETURNING THE TELES COPE TO THE DIRECT POSITION ONE CAN AGAIN BE MADE IN THIS POSITION AND THE TERRESTRIAL OBJECT OBSERVED AGAIN FOR VERIFICA TIONS SAKE THE TERRESTRIAL OBSERVATION IN THE REVERSED SITU ATION SERVING FOR BOTH AZIMUTHS IN THAT POSITION THUS FOUR AZIMUTHS EACH FROM SIX TRANSITS OF TLLE SUNS LINMB AT THE VER TICAL WIRES CAN BE OBSERVED IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME IT IS EVIDENIT THAT THESE AZIMUTH OBSERVATIONS WOULD WHEN EVER FOUND NECESSARY BE VERY WELL SUITED FOR THE REDUCTION TO THE MEAN TIME ACCORDING TO THE METHOD INVETNTED BY MR SOLDNER IT IS PROPER TO MAKE THE AZIMUTHS AS INDEPENDENT OF THE RATE OF THE TIMEPIECE AS POSSIBLE AND THEREFORE TO MAKE OB SERVATIONS OF TIME AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE BEFORE AND AFTER THOSE OF THE AZIMUTHS AND IF SEVERAL OBSERVERS SHOULD BE TOGETHER A PROPER COMBINATION WHICH WOULD ADMIT BOTH OBSERVATIONS TO BE MADE AT THE SAME TIME WOULD BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUS THE CALCULATION OF THE RESULT CAN OF COURSE BE VARIED BE ING MADE EITHER FOR EACLH LIMBS TRANSIT OR AS I DID FOR EACH TRANSIT OF THE CENTRE BUT IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE DIRECT AND REVERSED OBSERVATIONS TOGETHER IN THE SANME CALCULATION THE FORMII OF SUCH AN OBSERVATION AND THE MANNER OF RE GISTERING THE RESULTS WILL BE SEEN IN THE CORRESPONDING EX AMNPLES OF THE DAYBOOK AND JOURNAL OF RESULTS I WILL HERE DESCRIBE ANOTHER NMETHOD OF OBSERVING AZINMUTHLS WHICH MAY BE OF USE IN CIRCUMSTANCES WLHICH ADMIT ONLY A PORTABLE TRANSIT AND THE MEANS OF DETERMINING THE TIMIE I APPLIED IT IN 1793 IN SWITZERLAND AND IT MAY SOMETIMES BE PREFERABLE TO A MEASURETNENT ON A LESS ACCURATE INSTRUMENT I ADJUST THE TRANSIT TELESCOPE EXACTLY IN THE VERTICAL OF THE OBJECT BEFORE THE TIME WHEN THE SUN WILL PASS THIS VERTICAL AND OBSERVINGTHE TRANSIT OF BOTH LIMBS ON ALL THE WIRES THE TIME OF THE TRANSIT OF THE CENTRE IS THUS OBTAINED AND IT ISOF THE UNITED STATES 307 EVIDENT THAT THE RESULT OF THE CALCULATION OF THE AZIMUTH OF THIE SUN WILL GIVE AT TTHE SAMLE TIME THE AZIMNUTH OF THE OBJECT THE TIME BEING DETERMIINED BY PROPER MEANS AS NEAR TO THIS OBSERVATION AS POSSIBLE IN THIS MANNER THE AZIMUTHS OF ALL OBJECTS IN THE VERTICAL OF WHICH THE SUN PASSES IN THE DAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ZENITH MAY BE DETERMINED AND THE TERRESTRIAL ANGLES BETWEEN THEM BE TOLERABLY WELL ASCER TAINED BY THE SAME METLHOD ALSO AN ASTRONOMICAL CIRCLE WELL AD JUSTED IN THE VERTICAL NMAY SERVE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF AZINMUTHS AND WHEN IT IS REQUIRED TO LAY OFF CERTAIN DIREC TIONS ON THIE EARTH SIGNALS MAY BE PLACED PURPOSELY TO OB SERVE AZIMUTHS UPON THEMN BY THIS MNETHOD AND IF THE SUN SHOULD NOT AT THE TIME PASS SUCH A VERTICAL A STAR PROPERLY SITULATED SHOULD BE CHOSEN FOR THE PURPOSE IT IS PROPER IN THIS PLACE TO INTRODUCE SOME PRACTICAL RE MNARKS RELATIVE TO THE ILLUMINATION OF THE DIVISION WHICH HAS A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON THE ACCURACY AND FACILITY OF THE READING RHE LIGHT UPON THE DIVISIONS NMUST BE REFLECTED FROM A WHITE UNPOLISHED PLANE IT MNUST FALL UPON THE DIVI SIONS IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR LENGTH AND NOT FR ONM THE SIDE  AND IF THE REFLECTION FROM THE LIMB ENTER THE MICROSCOPE THE GREATEST LIGHT WILL BE OBTAINED ALL GLARING LIGHT WILL BE IM PROPER I FOUNID WHITE PAPER THE MOST PROPER SURFACE AND FOR THIS PURPOSE I FOLDED A QUARTO SHEET INTO AN OCTAVO FORM AND TO GIVE IT MORE SOLIDITY FOLDED RIMS TO THE OPEN SIDES THEN GIVING TO THIS AGAIN A FOLD IN THE MIDDLE SO AS TO MAKE THE TWO PARTS STAND AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH EACH OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE HALF I CUT A CIRCULAR HOLE EXACTLY FITTING THE MICROSCOPE TULE BELOW ITS HOLDER AND ADAPTED TO IT BY ITS CLOSE FITTING THE SCREW GOING OVER THE WLHOLE LENGTH OF THE TUBE IT KEPT ITS POSITION AND THE OTHER HALF HUNG DOWN TO WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE LITMIB OF THE CIRCLE OUTSIDE TLHE REFLECTING SURFACE BEING TLHUS A TANGENT TO IT AND NEARLY PERPENDICULAR TO THE LIMB WIIEN THE OBSERVER STANDS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RADIUS OF THE MICROSCOPE THE LIGHT COMES AS FROM THE CENTRE OF THE INSTRUMENT REFLECTED IN THE SATNE308 SURVEY OF THE COAST DIRECTION AND PRESENTS THE DIVISIONS WITHOUT ANY FALSE SHADE AND VERY DISTINCT IN ANY OTHER POSITION OF THIE LIGHT OR OF THE REFLECTION THE STROKES WHICH ALWAYS PRESENT CAVITIES THOUGH THEY APPEAR FILLED WILL BE VIEWED ON THBE SIDE AS ONE SIDE OF THIS CAVITY WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE LIGHT AND THE OTHER IN THE SHADE AND THE INIFLUENCE OF THIS UPON THE ACCURACY OF THE READING IS MUCH GREATER THAN MIGHT BE IMAGINED EXCEED ING THE LIMITS WITHIN WHICLH IT IS POSSIBLE TO READ WITH THESE NMICROSCOPES FOR THIS SAME REASON NIGHT OBSERVATIONS HAVE NOT THE SAME DEGREE OF ACCURACY ON THE HORIZONTAL LIMB OF A THEODOLITE AS THOSE MADE DURING THE DAY  BECAUSE IN THIS CASE IT IS IMPOS SIBLE TO MAKE THE LIGHT FALL IN THE PROPER DIRECTION AS NO LIGHT CAN BE PLACED IN THE CENTRE AND OUTSIDE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RADIUS IT WOULD OCCUPY THE PLACE BELONGING TO THE OB SERVER NIGHT AZIMUTHS LOSE MIUCH ON THAT ACCOUNT AND SEL DOM GIVE THE SATISFACTION EXPECTED  ON THE SIGNALS AND THE SYSTENZ OF WIRES IN THE TELESCOPE AN OBJECT CLOSELV CONNECTED WITH THE ACCURACY OF THE OB SERVATION OF TERRESTRIAL ANGLES IS THE CHOICE OF PROPER AND DIS TINCT SIGNALS IND THE ADAPTATION OF THE SYSTEM OF WIRES TO THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE I MUST OBSERVE THAT OBJECTS SEEN FIROM A GREAT DISTANCE ARE VISIBLE RATHIER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR DIFFER ENCE IN LIGHT AND COLOUR FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS OR THE BACK GR OUND ON WHICH THEY ATE PROJECTED THAN IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SIZE WHICH ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES VERY LITTLE TOWARDS THE EFFECTING OF THE VISION AND IS ALWAYS DETRIMENTAL TO ITS DISTINCTNESS A SMALL OBJECT SEEN BY THE SHADED SIDE IF PRO JECTED UPONI A CLEAR SKY WILL BE VISIBLE AT A GREAT DISTANCE AND WILL BE MUCH MORE DISTINCT IF IT REFTECT THE RAYS OF THEOF THE UNITED STATES 309 SUN TO THE OBSERVER THESE REMARKS MUST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OFTEN MADE AND YET I HIAVE NOT SEEN THAT ADVANTAGE HAS EVER BEEN TAKEN OF THEM FOR THE PURPOSE HERE IN VIEW A STAFF IS ALWAYS A BAD SIGNAL AS IT WILL ALWAYS BE SEEN DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO THE STATE OF THE ILLUMINATION AND IF IT IS FURNISHED WITH A FLAG FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCOVERING AND DISCERNING IT FROM OTHER SIMILAR OBJECTS THIS WILL EASILY MNIS LEAD THE OBSERVER AS TO ITS ACTUAL POSITION AND CERTAINLY MAKE IT APPEAR TO STAND OUT OF THE PERPENDICULAR IF AT ANY CONSIDE RABLE DISTANCE TRUNCATED PYRAMIDS ARE INCONVENIENTLY LARGE AND REQUIRE PECULIAR REDUCTIONS ACCORDING TO THE SIDE OF THEM WHICH IS OBSERVABLE AND WHICH NMAY EVEN CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF THE SHORT TIME OF OBSERVATION BY THE CHANGE OF THE ILLUMINATION FOR THE VERTICAL ANGLES THE STAFF CANNOT SERVE AT ALL RHE POINT AT WHICH IT IS FASTENED INTO THE EARTH CAN NEVER BE AS CERTAINED WITH CERTAINTY AS IT MAY BE HIDDEN BY UNEVEN GROUND BEFORE OR THE GROUND FROTM BEHIND UPON WHICH IT IS PROJECTED MAY BE MISTAKEN FOR IT TRUNCATED PYRANMIDS MAY BE SEEN OF DIFFERENT HEIGHTS IN DIFFERENT STATES OF THE ATMIOS PHERE A SIGNAL SHOWING ITSELF DETACHED FROM THE GROUND ON WHICL IT STANDS WILL ALSO BE DISTINGUISHED FAR BETTER THAN A MUCH LARGER ONE CONNECTED WITH THE GROUND ALL THESE REMARKS I MIGHT SUPPORT WITH DAILY EXPERIENCE OF WHICH IT WILL SUFFICE TO MENTION THAT IN A WARM SUMMER DAY THE GILT BALL OF A STEEPLE MAY BE SEEN AT A GREAT DISTANCE WHEN THE STEEPLE ITSELF IS ONLY SUPPOSED AND NOT ACTUALLY DIS TINGUISHED MAKING IN 1798 A TRIANGULATION IN SWITZERLAND WITH A RE PEATING CIRCLE WITH TWO TELESCOPES WHERE THE ANGLES ARE MEASURED IN THE PLANE OF THE OBJECTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE ELEVATION OF THE TRIANGLE POINTS BEING AN OBJECT OF IN TEREST I WAS DESIROUS OF A DISTINCT SIGNAL WHICH SHOULD HE SEEN EQUALLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS THIS LEAD ME TO THE IDEA OF FORMING SPHERES ELEVATED ON POLES THEY WERE FORMED OF BARREL VOL IIS 2310 SURVEY OF THE COAST HOOPS MAKING THE RIBS OF THE SPHERE AND COVERED WITHI WHITE LINEN THEIR DIAMETERS WERE FROMI SIXTEEN TO TWENTY INCHES THEY WERE VERY DISTINCTLY VISIBLE WITHI THE TELESCOPE ON MY INSTRUMNENT THIOUGH ONLV THIRTEEN INCHES IN LENIGTL AT A DISTANCE OF FIFTY MILES AND AS FAR AS TEN TNILES WITH THE NA KED EYE BUT THEY DID NOT ANSWER EQUALLY WELL IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE OF THIS COUNTRY NEAR THIE SEA SHIORE AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED I WAS THEREFORE INDUCED TO USE A KITND OF SIG NALS PRESENTING A LUMINOUS POINT BY THE REFLECTION OF THE SUN AND ADAPTED TO THE SITUATION OF THAT BODY AT SUCH TIMES OF THE DAY AS FROMN THE GENERAL STATE OF ILLUMINATION APPEARED TO BE MOST FAVOURABLE TO OBSERVATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THE ILLUNMINATION WILL NOT SERVE AT ALL FOR DISTINCT VISION AND EVEN THE LARGEST OBJECTS BECOME INDISTINCT ON ACCOUNT OF THE VAPOUR AS THIS IS COMNMONLY CALLED OR RATHER BECAUSE THE REFLIDCTION OF THE

OBSERVER FEELS ALWAYS SOMEWHAT ANXIOUS ON THAT ACCOUNT IT IS LHOWEVER EVIDENT THAT THE SUCCESSIVE STEPS OF THE LEVEL OR BACK TELESCOPE MEASURE THE ANGLE IN THE SAME MLANNER AS THOSE OF THE FRONT

THE SCREW AT M CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS OF UNEQUAL THREADS OR PATHS EACH GOING IN THE NUT OF ITS RESPECTIVE ARM AND THERE BY CAUSING THE MOTION OF THE CIRCLE ITSELF TO ARISE ONLY FROM THE DIFFERENCE OF

SCREWS WORKING IN EACTH OTHER EXACTLY EQUAL IN ALL RESPECTS TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE TWOFEET THEODOLITE ON SOME ADJUSTNMENTS OF THE REPEATING CIRCLE IT WILL NOT BE EXPECTED THAT I SHOULD GIVE HERE A FULL DE SCRIPTION OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF THIS INSTRUMENT IT IS TOO EASY AND TOO WELL KNOWN BUT I HAVE NO WHERE SEEN MENTIONED THE MOST PROPER MODE OF PLACING THE CIRCLE ACCURATELY IN THIE PLANE OF THE VERTICAL AND OF VERIFYING THE PARALLELISM OF THE TWO MOTIONS OF THE CIRCLE AND THE TELESCOPE THIS CONSISTS IN OBSERVING THE POLE STAR BEST IN ITS GREAT EST DIGRESSION BOTH DIRECTLY AND BY REFLECTION

FIROM VACILLATION IF NECESSARY FROM THE WIND BY A GLASS CAP IF THE MOTION OF THE TELESCOPE IS EXACTLY VERTICAL THE RE FLECTED STAR IN THE MERCURY WILL COINCIDE WITH THE SANME VER TICAL WIRE WLICH WAS IOINTED UIPON THE STAR VIEWED DIRECTLY IF NOT IT MUST BE CORRECTED HALF BY MOVING THE PLANE OF THE CIRCLE ROUND UPON THE AXIS Q AFTER UNCLAMPING THE SCREWS 1 1 AND HALF BY THE TANGENT SCREW ON THE HORIZONTAL CIRCLE IF THE CIRCLE IS MOVED IN THE VERTICAL WITH THE TELESCOPE CLAMPED AND EVERY THING ARRANGED AS IN THE ABOVE OBSERVA TION THE VERTICALITY OF ITS MOTION WILL BE ASCERTAINED IF THERE FORE THERE IS ANY DOUBT RESPECTING THE PARALLELISM OF THE CIRCLE AND THE TELESCOPE IT WILL BE BEST TO BEGIN FIRST BY MAKING THE OBSERVATION WITH THE CIRCLE THE TELESCOPE BEING CLAMPED AND WHLEN THIS IS ADJUSTED TO ADLJULST THE WIRES ACCORDINGLY WHEN THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MLADE AND BEFORE ANY CLHATNGE IN THE LEVEL OF THE INSTRUMENT TAKES PLACE THE LEVEL S ON THE AXIS MUST HE ADJTUSTED AND IT WILL TTHEN SERVE TO VERIFY THE VER TICALITY OF THE CIRCLE AS LONG AS THIS CIRCLE IS KEPT IN ITS PLACE I THEREFORE HAD THE PACKINIG BOXES SO CONSTRUCTED THAT THE INSTRUNMENT MIGHT BE REMOVED WITHOUT TAKINGR IT APART AS I OBSERVED TLHAT THE SEPARATE PACKING OF THE CIRCLE WITH THE GREAT COUNTERPOISE SUBJECTED THE INSTRUMENT TO INJURY I THINK THAT SOME MECHANICAL ARRANGEMENT MIGHT BE EASILY AND ADVANTAOEOUJSLY ADOPTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING TO THIS ADJUSTMENT A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF ACCURACY THE ILLUMINATION OF THE READINGS MUST BE CAREFULLY ATTEND ETD TO AS AT NIGHT THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT AND TLHEREBY BECOME UNICERTAIN I APPLIED HERE ALSO WITH THE BEST SUCCESS PAPER REFLECTORS FOLDING A QUARTO SHEET EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED FOR THE TWOFEET THEODOLITE BUT INSTEAD OF GIVING IT A FOLD TO BEND IT AT RIGHT ANGLES I CUT FROM ABOUT THREEQUARTERS OF AN INCH BEHIND THE CIRCULAR HOLE WHICH IS HERE MADE SO AS TO FIT THE TUBE OF THE MAGNIFIER A SLIT TO ADMIT THE ARM OF THIS MAGNIFIER ABOUT TWO INCHES AND A HALF LONG AND ABOTIT822 SURVEY OF THE COAST HALF AN INCH FARTHER ANOTHER SHORT SLIT AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE FORMER BY THESE THE PAPER WAS SLIDED AND HELD UPON THE ARM OF THE MAGNIFIER AND SCREWED TO IT ALONG WITH ITS TUBE HOLDING A LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CIRCLE PROPERLY THE LIGHT WILL BE REFLECTED VERY WELL ON THE DIVISIONS AND GIVE A VERY GOOD READING DURING THE DAY THE FREE LIGHT WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT IT IS USEFUL TO KNOW EXACTLY THE ANGULAR DISTANCES OF THE WIRES IN THE TELESCOPE AND THE VALUES OF THE DIVISIONS OF THE LEVEL THE FIRST ARE VERY EASILY DETERMINED BY POINTING UPON A WELL DEFINED OBJECT WITH THE DIFFERENT WIRES AND READ ING THE VERNIERS THE LAST ARE EQUALLY EASY TO DETERMINE IN THESE INSTRUMENTS HAVING READINGS TO THE LEVEL MOTION BY PLACING THE LEVEL ON ALL DIVISIONS SUCCESSIVELY AND READING ALL FOUR VERNIERS IT IS PROPER TO REPEAT THESE OBSERVATIONS WHEN MADE AS THE DETERMINATION HAS REGARD TO A VERY SMALL QUANTITY METHODS FOR

DURING WHICH THE CIRCLE MAY MOVE CON SIDERABLY IN THE VERTICAL BY POINTING REQUIRES GREAT DEXTERITY IN THE ASSISTANT ANID SINCE THE LEVEL ITSELF OSCILLATES IN PASSING TO EQUILIBRIUM IT IS OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO BE SURE OF ITS PO SITION FROM ONE COMPLETE OBSERVATION WITH THE CIRCLE IN ITS TWO POSITIONS AND THE INDISCRIMINATE MEAN OF THE FOUR READINGS ALL THE MAIN CORRECTIONS OF THE OBSERVATION ARE OBTAINED SUIC CEEDING OBSERVATIONS SERVE ONLY TO AUGMENIT THE PROBABILITY OF ACCURACY ANID TO CORRECT ACCIDENTAL ERRORS OF DIVISION WHICH AS ALREADY STATED MAY BE CONSIDERED A MINIMUM IN THE INSTRUMENTS OF MR TROUGHTON A METHOD SATISFYING THE TWO FIRST MENTIONED DESIDERATA WILL THEREFORE SECURE MORE ACCURACY IN THIS KIND OF OBSERVA TIOFL THAN THE USUAL MODE OF REPEATING MY PECULIAR SITUA TION WITH ASSISTANTS ENTIRELY UNACQUAINTED WITH OBSERVATIONS JOINED TO THESE CONSIDERATIONS LED ME TO DEVISE THE FOLLOW ING METHOD OF OBSERVING TIME WHICH I HAVE EVER SINCE PRAC TISED AND WHICH DR TIARKS THE BRITISH ASTRONOMER FOR THE BOUNDARY LINE AT CANADA ADOPTED ALSO IN OUR COMMON WORKS THERE TRHE INSTRUMENT BEING WELL LEVELLED AND THE POSITION OF THE FRONT TELESCOPE READ OFT AS USUAL THE CIRCLE IS PLACED SO ASOF THE UNITED STATES 327 TO RECEIVE THE TRANSIT OF THE STAR OR BOTH LIMBS OF THE SUN AT ALL THE HORIZONTAL WIRES IN THIS SITUATION THE LEVEL IS ADJUST ED WITH EASE SUFFICIENT TIME BEING GIVEN BY THE PLACING OF THE CIRCLE AND THE TRANSIT OF THE STAR OR BOTH LIMNBS OF THE SUN AT EACHI OF THE THREE WIRES IS OBSERVED THIS CAN BE DONE WITH THE GREATEST NICETY THE INSTRUMENT BEING AT REST AND ALL THE OBSERVERS ATTENTION BEING DIRECTED TO THE TIMNE OF CONTACT WHICH IS RAPID THE OBSERVER CALLING OUT JVULL AT EACH TRANSIT THE SECRETARY BEING ATTENTIVE TO THE CHRONOMETER OR CLOCK CAN NOTE THE TIME WITH THE GREATEST ACCURACY AND THE TRANSIT OF THE SUNS CENTRE IS DETERMINED BY SIX OBSERVA TIONS THE CIRCLE BEING NOW BROUGHT PNTO ITS SECOND POSITIONL BY A SEMIREVOLUTION ON ITS VERTICAL AXIS THE LEVEL WILL REMAIN ADJUSTED IF THE INSTRUMENT IS WELL LEVELLED IF IT REQUIRE ANY CORRECTION THIS NMUST BE MADE BY THE CIRCLE SCREW MI AS THE POSITIONI OF THE LEVEL UPON THE CIRCLE MUST BE PRESERVED TIHE TELESCOPE IS THEN UNCLAMPED AT D AND AGAIN PLACED SO AS TO RECEIVE THE TRANSITS AS BEFORE THLESE ARE OBSERVED AND THE TIME NOTED AS LHAS BEEN DONE IN THE FIRST POSITIONI TRLHIS OBSERVATION BEING MADE THE VERNIERS OF THE FIRONT TE LESCOPE ARE AGAIN READ AND GIVE THLE DOUBLE ZENITH DISTANCE OR RATHER THE SUM OF THIE TWO ZENITH DISTANCES AT THE TIMES OF THE OBSERVED TRANSITS THE HALF OF THIS SUM IS TO BE CONSI DERED AS CORRESPONDING TO THE MEAN TIME BETWEEN THE TWO TRANSITS SUCH AN OBSERVATION WHEN TAKEN NEAR THE PRIME VERTICAL WILL NOT EXCEED THE TIRNE ALLOWED FOR TAKING AN ARITHMETICAL MEAN AND WILL BE THE RESULT OF SIX OR TWELVE OBSERVATIONS OF TIME IF THE TRANSIT OF THE SUN IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO OBSERVE BOTLH LIMBS ON EACH SIDE THE ANTECEDENT MAY BE TAKEN IN THE FIRST POSITION AND THE CONSEQUENT IN THIE SECOND THERE BEING THEN BUT HALF THE NUMBER OF TIMES OBTAINED THE OBSERVATION MAY BE REPEATED AFTER THE READINIG AND A MEAN OF TWO SUCH OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AS IN ANY OTHER CASE CALCU LATING EACH SEPARATE 2328 SURVEY OP THE COAST IN ALL CASES THE APPLICATION OF MR SOIDNERS METHOD OF REDUCING ALL OBSERVATIONS TO THE MEAN TIME BY CORRECTING THE RESULT FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE DISTANCES FROM THIE SAME APPLIES HERE WITH GREAT EASE AND ACCURACY SINCE FOR EACH TRANSIT THE DISTANCES OF THE WIRES ARE EQUAL ON EACLH SIDE AS NEARLY AS THE DISTANCES OF THE WIRES ARE AND THEREFORE THIE CALECULATION OF THIS CORRECTION MAY BE MADE FOR HALF THEIR NUMBER ONLY IT WILL THEREFORE ALWAYS BE FOUND ADVANTAGEOUS TO APPLY THIS METHOD IN THE CALCULATION OF THE RESULTS TRHIS METHOD OF OBSERVING WILL BE FOUND VERY SATISFACTORY IN PRACTICE IN REGARD TO ACCURACY AND A SAVING OF TIMIIE TOGE THER WITH THE FACILITY OF CHOOSING IT SO AS TO COME NEAREST THE PRIME VERTICAL THIS METHOD WILL ADMIT AN OBSERVATION OF TIME TO BE TAKEN AMONG FLYING CLOUDS WHEN THE METHOD BY REPETITION WOULD BE INAPPLICABLE AND WHEN NO COMPLETE OBSERVATION CAN BE OBTAINED THE OBSERVATION OF ANY PAIR OF CORRESPONDING WIRES IN BOTH POSITIONS OF THE CIRCLE WILL AT LEAST GIVE AN APPROXI MATE RESULT WHICH WILL OFTEN BE USEFUL IT WOULD BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUS IN USING THIS METHOD TO HAVE FIVE HORIZONTAL WIRES IN THE TELESCOPE WITHIN A SPACE NEAR THAT OCCUPIED BY THE THREE AS THE TRANSITS COULD EASILY BE OBSERVED AND THE GAIN FOR EACH WIRE WOULD BE DOUBLE IN THIE RESULT I HAVE THEREFORE SOMETIMES APPLIED THEM THE REGISTERING OF SUCH AN OBSERVATION AND THE MANNER OF TAKING THE RESULT WILL BE FOUND IN THEIR PROPER PLACES IN THE DAYBOOK AND THE JOURNAL OF RESULTS DESCRIPTION OF THE REPEATING THEODOLITE OF ONE FOOT DIAMETER BESIDES THE GREAT THEODOLITE IT WAS VERY DESIRABLE AS WELL FOR THE INTENLED SURVEY OF TTE COAST AS FOR OTHER USES IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVE SONME INSTRUMENTS OF THE THEODOLITE KIND OFOF THE UNITED STATES 329 A SNMALLER DIAMETER AND YET CAPABLE OF GIVING THE SAME AC CURACY AS THE LARGE INSTRUMENTS THOUGH AT THE EXPENSE OF NMORE SKILL LABOUR AND TIME OF THE OBSERVER IT WAS ALSO DESIRABLE THAT THIE SAMNE INSTRUMENT SHOULD EQUALLY SERVE FOR VERTICAL ANGLES IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE OBSERVER TO DETERMINE ACCURATELY LATITUDES TIMES AND THE ANIGLES OF ELEVATION OF THE SIGNALS TTHE NMULTIPLICATION OF THE TERRESTRIAL ANGLES IN THE PLANE OF THE HORIZON WAS FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT IN THE PLANE OF THIE OB JECTS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT INFLUENCE OF REFIRACTION NEAR THE SEA SHORE PARTICULARLY UPON SANDY BEACHES AND ISLANDS WHERE IT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS VARYING CONSTANTLY AND EVEN A SAV ING OF TIME IN THE CALCULATIONS WAS AN OBJECT WORTH CONSIDE RATION IT WAS NECESSARY ON THIS ACCOUNT THAT THE INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE OF THE REPEATING KIND AND A THEODOLITE IN PLANNING AN INSTRUMNENT TO ANSWER THESE VIEWS THE PRIN CIPLES MENTIONED WHEN TREATING OF THE TWOFEET THEODOLITE AND THE REPEATING CIRCLE WITH TWO TELESCOPES LEAD ME TO UNITE THE PROPERTIES OF BOTH THESE INSTRUMENTS OMITTING ONLY THE NMEANS OF MEASURING ANGLES IN INCLINED PLANES IN REPEATING INSTRUMENTS THE MAIN POINTS TO ENSURE ACCU RACY ARETHE EXACT AND STEADY LEVELLING OF THE INSTRUMENT AND THE CONSTANT PARALLELISM OF THE MOTIONS WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER IN THE COURSE OF THE REPEATED MEASUREMENT OF AN ANGLE THESE BEINIG SECURED THE PLANE OF THE DIVIDED CIRCLE ITSELF WITH ITS DIVISION SERVES AS A MERE INDICATOI OF THE OPE RATIONS WHICH HAS NO INFLUENCE UNTIL IN THE FINAL READING OF THE STOPPING POINT BY THE AMOUNT OF THE REDUCTION OF THIE DIS TANCE OF IT FROM ITS INTERSECTION WITH THE REAL HORIZON AND BY THE ACCIDENTAL ERROR OF THE DIVISION USED WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE TWO SMALLEST ERRORS RHE INFLUENCE OF EC CENTRICITY BEING CORRECTED BV THE INDISCRIMINATE MEAN OF THE THREE READINGS AND THE INSTRUMENT ADMITTING ALL THE SYSTEMA TIC COMBINATION OF THE SERIES OF ANGLES WHICH THE TWOFEET THEODOLITE ADMITS FOR THE SINGLE ANGLES THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS FAR AS RELATES TO THE MODE OF MUL330 SURVEY OF THE COAST TIPLYING AND THE MOTIONS OF THE AXIS COULD EVIDENTLY BE EXE CUTED IN THE VERTICAL AS WELL AS IN THE HORIZONTAL CIRCLE BY MAKING THE LATTER REVOLVE IN THE MANNER OF A TRANSIT NOT ONLY ALL COUNTERPOISING WEIGHT MIGHT BE AVOIDED AND THERE FORE THE WEIGHT OF THE INSTRUMENT VERY MUCH DIMINISHED BUT ALSO ITS STABILITY IN THE OBSERVATION MIGHT BE SECURED UPON THESE CONSIDERATIONS I FOUNDED THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN INSTRUMENT OF WHICH I PRESENTED A PLAN IN FULL SIZE TO MR TROUGHTON WHO APPROVING THE PRINCIPLES THOUGHT HIOWEVER AT FIRST THAT WITLH EIGHTEEN INCLES DIAMETER AS I WISHED IT IT WOULD PRESENT SOME DIFFICULTIES AND

SURVEY OF THE COAST MENTIONED A LITTLE INWARDS IT NMAY BE DISENGAGED FROM THE PINI IN THE PIECE Q WHICH HOLDS IT IN ITS POSITION THEN THE AXIS OF THE TELESCOPE CAN BE LIFTED OUT OF ITS SUPPORTS AND THE WHOLE UPPER PART WHICH SERVES TO MEASURE VERTICAL ANGLES CAN BE TAKEN OFF AND PLACED IN AN INVERTED POSITION FOR THE VERIFICATION OF THE LINE OF COLLIMATION OF THE TELESCOPE THLOUGH IT CAN NOT SERVE IN THIS INVERTED POSITION FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF VERTICAL ANGLES THE VERIFICATION TELESCOPE BELOW THE INSTRUMENT IS EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THE UPPER ANID CAN IF DESIRED BE USED IN ITS PLACE IT HANGS

OIJECT END TO EASE THE FIRST APPROXIMATE LEVELLING OF THE INSTRUMENT THERE ARE TWO SMALL LEVELS K K ABOUT TWO INCHES AND A HALF LONG AND HALF AN INCH IN DIAMETER PLACED AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER AT THE SIDE OF THE SOCKET OF THE AXIS BETWEEN THE TWO COLUMNS ON THE SIDE OPPOSITE TO THE VERNIER MARKED A WHICH IN THE FIGURE SHOW ONLY A LITTLE BETWEEN THE AXIS AND THE COLUMNS THE ELEVATION OF THE UPPER TELESCOPE ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL CIRCLE INCREASES THE FACILITY OF OBSERVING VERY HIGH ALTITUDES THE EYE END PASSES THROUGH THE NADIR ABOVE THE PIECE J CROSSING THE TOP OF THE VERTICAL AXIS THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT IS ABOUT THIRTYTWO INCHES HIGH AND THE BASE OF IT THROUGHLL THE TRUNCATED CONES IS A CIRCLE OF ABOUT NINETEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER IT IS THEREFORE WELL PROPORTIONED FOR STABILITY PAR TICULARLY AS THE UPPER PARTS ARE NOT HEAVY IN MY ORIGINAL PLAN SEVERAL OF THE ARRANGEMENTS WERE DIF FERENT RHEY WERE EXECUTED WITH GREAT SUCCESS IN ANOTHER INSTRUMENT AND EVERY ARTIST OR PRACTICAL EXPERIENCED O SERVER WILL OF COURSE VARY THE DISPOSITION OF MANY OF THE PARTSOF THE UNITED STATES 33 ACCORDING TO HIS OWN CONVENIIENCE AND EXPERIENCE AND ALSO ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR SKILL OR MEANS OF THE ARTIST WHO CONSTRUCTS THE INSTRUMENT THE HIGH OPINION WHICH I HAD REASON TO ENTERTAIN OF SO DISTINGUISHED ANI ARTIST AS MR TROUGHTON INDUCED ME TO LEAVE MUCH TO HIS JUDGMENT AND IDEAS I HAD THE HORIZOTNTAL CIRCLE CONSTRUCTED SO AS TO HAVE THE AXES OF BOTH MOTIONS THE CENTRE PART HAD CONES BOTH DOWNWARDTS AND UPWARDS THE AXIS DOWNWARDS REVOLVED IN THE CENTRE OF THE STAND PART THE LEGS OF THIS WERE IN CLINIED FROM THE CENTRE TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE WHERE THE PER PENDICULAR SCREWS COME AND UPON WHICH THE INSTRUMENT STANIDS THE OTHER AXIS RECEIVES THE UPPER PART OF THE IN STRUMENT BY MEANS OF A SOCKET SIMILAR TO THAT IN THE OTHER INSTRUNMENT BUT MUCH SHORTER TRHESE TWO AXES WERE OF BELL METAL WITH STEEL RINGS AT THEIR INNER AND OUTER ENDS THEY WERE DIFFERENTLY PROPORTIONED TO EACH OTHER THE LOWER WAS ABOUT TWICE AS LONG AS THE UPPER AND OF A MORE ACUTE CONICAL SHAPE IN ORDER TO GIVE IT A GREATER WEDGING POWER WHICH WITH THE GREATER SUPERIN CUMBENT WEIGHT ON IT WHEN THE CIRCLE IS MOVED WITH THE UP PER PART INCREASED ITS FRICTION THE UPPER AXIS WAS ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG ITS LOWER DIAMETER WAS ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH ITS UPPER LESS THAN ONE INCH THE SOCKET OF THE AXIS LAY CLOSE TO IT AND MOVED WITLH EASE AS THE WEIGHT OF THE UPPER PART WAS LIGHT ACCORDINGLY IN MOVING THIS PART THE GREAT WEIGHT OF THE HORIZONTAL CIRCLE AND ITS GREAT FRICTION PREVENTED ALL DRAGGING OF IT AFTER THIS MOTION THIS IN THE INSTRUMENTS MADE BY MR TRROUGHTON AND IN WHICTH THE HO RIZONTAL CIRCLE IS LIGHT IS PREVENTED BY COMPLETELY DETACHING THE CIRCLE FROM THIE UPPER PART WHEN THE CLAMP A IS LOOSE MR TROUGHTONS OBJECTION TO THIS SHAPE OF THE AXES WAS THAT THEY COULD NOT BE RUBBED SO WELL WITH EMERY IN A KIND OF SCREWING MOTION WHICH TAKES OFF ALL THE RINGS OF TURNING AND RENDERS THEM SMOOTH BUT AS THESE RINGS ALWAYS FORM THEMSELVES IN THE INSTRUMENT BY USE I SHOULD THINK THAT IN336 SURVEY OF THE COAST VERTICAL AXES THERE IS NO BAD INFLUENCE TO BE APPREHENDED FROM THEM THE VERTICAL CIRCLE BEING SUPPORTED IN THIS KIND OF INSTRU MENTS BETWEEN TWO COLUMIINS IT IS SUBJECT TO LESS SPRING AND HAS MUCH MORE STABILITY THAN IN THE CIRCLE WITH TWO TELE SCOPES WHERE THE DOUBLE WEIGHT OF THE CIRCLE HANGS UPON A SHORT AXIS UPON WHICHI EQULLIBRIUM IS MNAIJNTAINED BETWEEN THE CIRCLE AND ITS COUNTERPOISE THE VERIFICATION OF THE VERTICALITY BY THE POLE STAR CAN BE MADE WITH TLHE GREATEST NICETY AND THE LARGE DETACHED LEVEL ITSELF CAN BE ADJUSTED UPON IT METHOD OF OBSERVING HORIZONTAL ANGLES WITH THE REPEATIZLG THEODOLITE THE ADJUSTMENTS OF THIS INSTRUMENT ARE EVIDENTLY THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE TWOFEET THEODOLITE AND GROUNDED UPON SITN PLE AND WELL KNOWN PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE SELF EVIDENT FROM A VIEW OF THE INSTRUMENT AND NEED THEREFORE NOT TO BE EX PLAINED HERE THE USE OF COMMON THEODOLITES WITLH DOUBLE AXES FOR THE REPETITION OF ANGLES IS ALSO SO WELL KNOWN THAT THE MERE DE SCRIPTION AND VIEW OF THE INSTRURNEINT WOULD LEAD TO THE USE OF THESE DOUBLE REPEATING THEODOLITES YET IT MAY BE PROPER TO DESCRIBE HERE THE MODE OF TAKING A REGULAR SERIES IN OR DER TO RENDER MAORE INTELLIGIBLE THE OTHER PECULARITIES WLICL ARE TO BE MNENTIONED AS MEANS LEADING TO THE GREATEST ACCU RACY WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS CAREFULLY LEVELLED THE RIDING LEVEL IS PLACED UPON THE ARM T PARALLEL TO THE VERTICAL CIRCLE AND THERE ADJUSTED THEN THE VERNIER A BEING PLACED UPON 00 OR ANY OTHER DI VISION WHICH MAY ALSO BE THE LAST READING OF A FOREGOING SEOF THE UNITED STATES 337 RIES THE STANDS OF THE VERINIERS A B C ARE INSERTED IN THE JOURNIAL THE CLANMP D BEING LOOSE THIE TELESCOPE PART TO GETLHERT WITH THE CIRCLE WILL BE TURNED SO AS TO POINT THE TELE SCOPE UPON THE OBJECT TO THE LEFT OF THE OBSERVER AND THE POINTING MADE BY THE TANGENT SCREW AT D AFTER WHICL THE THREE VERNIERS D E F ARE R EAD OFF AND INSERTED IN TTHE JOUR NAL IT IS BEST TO WRITE TLHETN CONSECUTIVELV IN THE SIX FIRST COLUMNS OF THE JOURNAL HEADING EACHI WITH ITS PROPER LETTER THE SUPERSCRIPTION OF THE ANGLE TO BE MEASURED BEING GENE RAL AND ABOVE ALL THE LETTERS WITH ANY REQUISITE REMARK OR DESIGNATION OF THE SIGNAL 5C TRHEN THE CLAMP AT A BEING OPENED THIE UPPER PART OF THE INSTRUMENT WITHOUT THE CIRCLE IS TURNED TOWARDS THE OBJECT TO THE RIGLHT OF THE OBSERVER AND BEING POINTED BY THE TANGTENT SCREW OF THE SAME THE FIRST ANGLE OF THE SERIES OF THE THREE VERNIERS A B C MAY BE READ AFTER THIS THE CLAMP AT D BEING OPENED AND THE TELESCOPE PART TOGETHER WITLH THE CIRCLE BEING TURNED BACK UPON THE OBJECT TO THE LEFT AND POINTED BY THE TANGENT SCREW AT D THE FIRST ANGLE OF THE SERIES OF D E F WILL BE OBTAINED IN THIS MANNER WILL THE OBSERVATIONS BE CONTINUED THROUGH AS MNANY REPETITIONS AS MNAY BE DESIRED PAVING ATTENTION TO CONCLUDE WITH THE SAME KIND OF MOVEMENT WITLH WHICH THE OBSERVATION HAS COMMENCED IN ORDER TO GIVE TO BOTH SERIES THE SANME NUMBER OF ANGLES IN ORDER TO KEEP SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PROGRESSION OF THE ANGLES IT IS ALSO PROPER TO READ ONE VERUIIER FOR INSTANCE A AND D AT EACH OBSER VATION AND INSERT THE READINGS IN THEIR PROPER PLACE IN THE DAYVBOOK FROM THE ORDER OF PROGRESSING HERE INDICATED THE ANGLES WILL SUCCESSIVELY FOLLOW THE ORDER OF THLE DIVISIONS IF NMORE SERIES ARE OBSERVED IT MAY BE PROPER TO TAKE THE SECONID SE RIES IN AN INVERSE ORDER OR BACKWARDS ON THE DIVISIONS AS THE INFLUENCE OF PRESSURES OF SCREWS OR FRICTION EC WOULD ACT INVERSELY AND THE INDISCRIMINATE MEAN CORRECT THEM AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT IF THE GREATEST ACCURACY BE AIMED AT338 SURVEY OF TILE COAST IT IS ADVISABLE TO TAKE TWO SERIES LIKE THE SIMPLE ANGLES IN THE TWOFEET THEODOLITE WITH THE TELESCOPE IN A DIRECT AND IN A REVERSED POSITION IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE THE INFLUENCE OF THE VERTICALITY OF THE TELESCOPE THOUGH NEAR THE HORIZON THIS INFLUENCE IS VERY SMALL IN LIKE MANNER ALSO THE INSTRLUMENT MAY BE PLACED IN THE THREE POSSIBLE POSITIONS OF THJE LEGS UPON THEIR CONIES AND SUCLH SERIES MAY BE TAKEN AT EACH PO SITION ALL THESE CHANGES WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTE TO ACCU RACY BY THE COMNPENSATION WHICH THEY WOULD GIVE TO THE IN DISCRIMINATE MEAN OF THE PROPER NUMBER OF SERIES IT MIGLHT BE ASSERTED THAT THESE CHANGES WITH SERIES OF ONLY A SMALLER NUMBER OF ANGLES WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO LONG SERIES IN ONE POSITION WHAT HAS BEEN SAID UPON THIS SUBJECT RELATIVE TO THE TWO FEET THEODOLITE REFERS EVIDENTLY TO THIS INSTRURMENT AS IT IS GROUNDED UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE ANGLES EXCEPTED WHICH IN USINIG IT ACCORDING TO SUCH A SYS TEM WOULD BE CONSIDERED MERELY AS A COMPENSATION FOR THE GREATER DIAMETER OF THE INSTRUMENT I SHALL NOT ENTER LHERE INTO FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS SUBJECT AS I NEVER LHAD TIME OR OP PORTUNITY TO TEST THESE INISTRUMENTS COMPLETELY I MEASURED ONLY SOME ANGLES BY WAY OF TRIAL THE COINCIDENCE OF WHICH WITH THOSE OF THE TWOFEET THEODOLITE WAS VERY SATISFACTORY METHOD OF OBSERVING VERTICAL ANGLES WITH THE REPEATING THEODOLITE WHEN THE INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN CAREFULLY ADJUSTED AND LEVEL LED IN ALL RESPECTS THE OBSERVATION OF A SERIES OF ZENITH DIS TANCES WITH IT IS TAKEN NEARLY IN THE SAME MANNER AS WITH THE REPEATING CIRCLE BUT IN RESPECT TO ITS ORDER IN THE USE OF THEOF THE UNITED STATES 339 CLAMPS IT ADMITS TWO DIFFERENT STUCCESSIONS DIFFERING ONLY ILL THE EASE WITH WHICH THE SCREWS COME TO THE HAND IN EACH NOTION THE OBSERVATION CAN EVIDENTLY BE MADE BY ONE PERSON ALONE AS THE LEVEL REQUIIRES NO PARTICULAR ATTENDANCE IT MAY LHOWEVER BE OBSERVED FIROM TIME TO TIME TO BE SURE THAT THE INSTRUMENT HAS NOT BEEN DISTURBED THE FOLLOWING ORDER WILL BRING THE SCREWS SO AS TO BE AL WAYS CONVENIENT TO THE HAND OF THE OBSERVER I PLACE THE VERNIER Z ON O OR ANY DIVISION AND READ Z AND Y THESE READINGS ARE WRITTEN IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH COLUMNS OF THE DAYBOOK 2 IHE CLAMP AT X BEING LOOSE MAKE THE FIRST OBSERVATION BY THE MOTION OF THE TELESCOPE ALONE AND POINT BV MEANS OF THE TANGENT SCREW OF THE SAME VERNIER Z WHEN THE OBJECT OBSERVED IS A CELESTIAL BODY THE TIME OF THIS OBSERVATION IS OBSERVED AND WRITTEN BEFORE THE READINGS OF Z AND Y IN THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE DAVBOOK 3 THEN W AND X ARE READ OFF AND WRITTEN IN THIE FIFTL AND SIXTLH COLUMNS OF THE DAYBOOK ONE LINE FARTHER DOWN THAN THE Z AND Y LHAVE BEEN WRITTEN 4 UNCLAMP THE CIRCLE AT Z TURN THE UPPER PART OF THE IN STRUMENT ONE HALF A CIRCUMFERENCE ROUND HORIZONTALLY AND THE TELESCOPE

TIMNE OBSERVED IS WRITTEN IN THE FIRST COLUMN OPPOSITE TO THE FOREGOING READINGS BY THIS THE FIRST ANGLE OF THE SERIES BY Z WILL BE OBTAINED A TURNING THE INSTRUMENT A SEMICIRCUMFERENCE HORIZON TALLY AND AFTER UNCLAMPING THE VERNIER X ALSO THE TELESCOPE ALONE WITHOUT THE CIRCLE THROUGH THE ZENITH TO THE OBJECT TO BE OBSERVED THE POINTING IS AGAIN PERFORMED BY THE TANGENT SCREW OF THE SANME VERNIER X WHEREBY THE FIRST ANGLE OF THE SECOND SERIES OR BY W X IS OBTAINED ANDTHE TIME OBSERVED IS WRITTEN AGAIN IN THE FIRST COLUMLN 6 THE OBSERVER MAY PROCEED IN THIS ORDER AND IN THE340 SURVEY OF THE COAST SAME MANNER AS WITH THE REPEATING CIRCLE BY A SUCCESSION OF THE ABOVE ALTERNATING MOTIONS UNTIL THE DESIRED SERIES IS OB TAINED ENDLING AT LAST WITH THE SAME MOTION WITH WHICH THE SERIES WAS BEGUN AS HERE BY A POINTING WITH THE TANGENT SCREW AT X 7 ALL THE TIMES OF SUCH A SERIES EXCEPT THE LAST WILL BE LONG TO THE SERIES OF Z AND Y AND ALL TIMES EXCEPTING THIE FIRST TO THE SERIES OF THE READING W X IF SEVERAL SERIES OF THE SAME ZENITH DISTANCE OF A TERRESTRIAL OBJECT SHOULD BE DESIRED FOR THE SAKE OF GREAT ACCURACY IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE TO TAKE THESE SERIES IN THE TWO DIFFERENT MANNERS WHICLH THE INSTRUMENT ADMITS ANID TO USE THE INDIS CRIMINATE NMEAN IN PREFERENCE TO EITHER THE MANNER OF TAKING OUT THE RESULTS OF SUCH A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS AND OF CALCULATING THEM IS OF COURSE EXACTLY THE SAME AS IN THE REPEATING CIRCLE WITH TWO TELESCOPES AND THE MODE OF REGISTERING THE OBSERVATIONS AND THE RESULTS IN THIE DAYBOOKS AND JOURNALS MAY THEREFORE BE OMITTED LHERE AS SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE METHOD OF OBSERVING TIME DESCRIBED IN THE REPEATING CIRCLE APPLIES ALSO TO THIS INISTRURMENT WITL EQUAL ADVANTAGE AND EASE BESIDES THIS THE EASE WITH WHICH THE LIGHT VERTICAL CIRCLE OR THE TELESCOPE ALONE MOVES UPON THE TTANSIT AXIS AFFORDS IN THE PRESENT CASE ANOTHER METHODVIZ TO MEASURE DOU BLE ALTITUDES BY REFLECTION ON A MERCURY HORIZON THE LEVEL SHOWING THE STABILITY OF THE INSTRUMENT WHICH FOR THIS KIND OF OBSERVATION NEEDS NO INVERSION OR MOVEMENT IN AZIMUTH EXCEPT FOR THE SMALL PROGRESS OF THE CELESTIAL BODY DURING THE OBSERVATION BY ALTERNATING THE MOTIONS OF THE TRANSIT WITH AND WITHOUT THE CIRCLE BETWEEN THE DIRECT OBJECT AND ITS IMAGE IN THE MERCURY HORIZON A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS OF DOUBLE ALTITUDES MAY BE OBTAINED WITH GREAT CELERITY AND IF THE SUN SHOULD BE THE OBJECT THE LIMBS MAY BE ALTERNATED AS IN ANOTHER OB SERVATION THE TITNES OF THE TWO SERIES WILL FOLLOW EXACTLY AS IN THE SERIES FOR THE ZENITH DISTANCES AND ALL OTHER DIRECOF THE UNITED STATES 34 T TIONS GIVEN FOR THESE APPLY EQUALLY TO THE SERIES OF DOUBLE ALTITUDES AN OBSERVER WITH A LITTLE EXPERIENCE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE SUCHI AN OBSERVATION WITHOUT FURTHER DIRECTION ALL THAT IS DESIRABLE FOR IT IS A LARGE MERCURY HORIZON IN ORDER TO HAVE NO NEED OF MOVING IT DURING THE OBSERVATION IT IS EASY TO  ADAPT TO THIS INSTRUMENT A STOPPING ARRANGE MENT FOR FINDING STARS BY NIGHT THESE MAY BE VERY LIGHT AND REMOVEABLE WHEN NOT NEEDED ON THIS OCCASION I MAY REMARK THAT IT IS PROPER TO MAKE THE TOUCHES OF THESE STOPS LIGHT SPRINGS AND NOT SOLID PARTS THAT IN CASE THEY SHOULD COME TO TOUCH THE TELESCOPE OR OTHER PART OF THE IN STRUMENT STOPPED MAY NOT BE AFFECTED BY IT DESCRIPTION OF THE REPEATING CIRCLE OF REFLECTION THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF REFLECTION FROM PLANE MNIRRORS HAS PRODUCED THE INSTRUMENT WHICHL HAS MOST CON TRIBUTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF NAUTICAL ASTRONOMY AND GEO GRAPHLY WHEN THE MIRRORS ARE PERFECT THE ACCURACY WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF VERTICAL ANGLES OBSERVED BY MNEANS OF THE MERCURIAL HORIZON IS CERTAINLY FAR SUPERIOR TO THAT FROM ANY OTHER INSTRUNMENIT OF EQUAL SIZE IN WHICH THE LEVEL OR PLUMB LINE IS USED THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS BEING THE SAME THE USE OF A CIRCLE INSTEAD OF A SEXTANT OR OCTANT INTRO DUCED BY TOBIAS MEYER HAS IN THIS AS IN ALL OTHER INSTRU INENTS FREED THE RESULTS FROM THE INFLUENCE OF ECCENTRICITY AND THE IMPROVEMENTS OF IT BY BORDA HAVE FURNISHED THE MEANS OF CORRECTING THE ERRORS OF THE GLASSES AND ADDING THE PROPERTY OF REPETITION IN MIIULTIPLYING INSTRUMENTS THE CONSTANT PARALLELISM OF THE TOL II Y 2342 SURVEY OP THE COAST MOTIONS IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES REQUIRED AS STATED BEFORE TLHIS IS EVIDEINTLY TO BE APPLIED IN THIS INSTRUMENT TO THE PLANE OF REFLECTION WHICH IS ITSELF DETERMINED BY THE POSI TION OF THE LARGE MIRROR IN BORDAS CONSTRUCTION THE AXIS UPON WHICH THE MIRROR REVOLVES BEING SHORT THE PLANE OF REFLECTION IS TOO MUCH GUIDED BY THE PLANE OF THE LIMB WHICH ARTISTS WELL KNOW CAN NOT BE EXECUTED WITH THE SAME ACCURACY AND EASE AS THE AXIS FROM THIS CAUSE THE ENGLISH ARTISTS ABANDONED THE PRINCIPLE OF REPETITION AND MR TROUGLHTON GAVE TO THE CIRCLE A CONSTRUCTION IN WHICH THE MOTION OF THE MIRROR IS DETERMINED BY A LONGER AXIS AND THE ECCENTRICITY CORRECTED BY THREE READINGS WITHOUT REPEATING WHICH FROM THE EXCEL LENCE OF HIS WORK AND HIS GREAT CARE IN THE CHOICE OF THE MIR RORS HAS GIVEN MOST EXCELLENIT RESULTS REFLECTING INSTRUMENTS BEING INDISPENSABLE IN THE SURVEY OF THE COAST FOR THE OBSERVATIONS TO DETERMINE SOUNDINGS AND OTHERS TO BE MADE ON BOARD OF VESSELS 5C I CONSIDER ED IT PROPER AGAIN TO TURN MY THOUGHTS TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THIS INSTRUMENT AS I HAD DONE LONIG BEFORE SO AS TO PRE SERVE BOTH THE MULTIPLYING PRINCIPLE AND THE STABILITY OF THE PLANIE OF REFLECTION I CONSIDERED THE CIRCLE ITSELF AS OF MI NOR INFLUENCE AND THEREFORE ALLOWED IT TO BE MOVEABLE AND ALTERNATELY CLAMPED TO THE SOLID PART OF THE INSTRUMENT WHICH BEARS THE SMALL MIRROR AND THE TELESCOPE OR TO THE ALHIDADE OF THE LARGE MIRROR AND MOVING WITH IT HAVING MADE A DESCRIPTION OF SUCH AN INSTRUMENT WITH A DRAWING OF FULL SIZE BEFORE I LEFT THE COUNTRY I PRESENTED IT TO MR TROUGHTON WHO SAID IMMEDIATELY THAT HE WOULD NMAKE ME ONE UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THOUGH DIFFERENT IN SHAPE AS HE WISHED THE INSTRUMENT TO BE LIGHTER HE SHOWED MNE AT THE SAME TIME THE IDEAS OF MR MENDOZA WHICH HAD COM PLETELY FAILED IN A SIMILAR ATTERMPT AND OF WHICH I THEN OB TAINED THE FIRST INFORMATION MR TROUGHTON GAVE TO THE INSTRUMENT A SHAPE SIMILAR TO THAT OF HIS REFLECTING CIRCLE FROM WHICH MY DRAWING DIFFEREDOF THE UNITED STATES 343 IN MANY RESPECTS BUT HERE I HAD THE REASON AS IN THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS TO LEAVE HIM AT FULL LIBERTY IN THIS RESPECT I MAY THEREFORE BE ALLOWED HTERE AGAIN TO SUPPOSE THE CON STRUCTION OF MR TROUGHTONS REFLECTING CIRCLE FULLY KNOWN AND DESCRIBE ONLY THE ALTERATIONS MADE TO IT TO GIVE IT THE REPEATING PROPERTY PLATE IX FIG 1 IS A PERSPECTIVE VIEW AND FIG 10 A SECTIONI OF THE CENTRE PART OF THE INSTRUMENT THE PARTS A B C D E FORM THE FRAME OF THE INSTRUMENT WHICH CONTAINIS IN THE CENI TRE PIECE E THE AXIS BOTH OF THE MIRROR AND THE CIRCLE IN A THE SUPPORT OF THIE TELESCOPE WHICH MAY BE LOWERED OR ELE VATED FOR THE EQUALISATION OF THE

THE UPPER PART WHIERE THE MIRROR IS FASTENED TO IT THE ALHIDADE AB OF THE GREAT MIRROR IS AT THE END OF THE AXIS OPPOSITE TO IT AND REVOLVES UPON THE CIRCLE SO AS TO READ UPON THE DIVISIONS THE ALHIDADE DC IS FIXED TO THE FRAME OF THE INSTRUMENT BETWEEN IT AND THE CIRCLE AND FORMS TWO DIAMETRICALLV OP POSITE READINGS UPON THE CIRCLE FOR THE MOTION OF THE MIRROR AND THE CIRCLE TOGETHER THE TWO AXES HAVE THEREFORE ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT REVOLU TIONS THE MIRROR WITHIN AND THE CIRCLE WITHOUT THE PIECE U U THE CLAMPS OF THE TWO MOTIONS ARE HERE BOTH OUTSIDE OF THE CIRCLE AS IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT THEY CROSS EACH OTHER IN THE OBSERVATION BOTH ALHIDADES WILL GIVE A SEPARATE SERIES OF ANGLES CORRECTED FOR ECCENTRICITY BY THE TWO OPPOSITE READ INGS344 SURVEY OP THE COAST WHENI THE MIRRORS ARE PARALLEL THE ALHIDADE AB STANDS UN DER THE TELESCOPE AND THE ALHIDADE DC IS AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH IT SO THAT IN THE OBSERVATIONS THE VERNIER A COMES ALTERNATE LY ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE TELESCOPE THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE COLLIMATION LINE OF THE TELESCOPE AND THAT FRONM THE CEN TRE TO THE SMALL MIRROR FORM AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 170 AT THE SMALL MIRROR ITHE DIRECTION OF THE HANDLES FF IS PERPENDI CULAR TO THE COLLIMATION LINE OF THE TELESCOPE AS ALL ANGLES ARE MEASURED AT LEAST DOUBLE NAMELY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PARALLELISMS THE CIRCLE IS DIVIDED LIKE EVERY OTHER INTO 3600 TO GIVE TO THE GREAT MIRROR THE FULL FIELD OF REFLECTIOTN ON THE SIDE OF THE TELESCOPE WHEN LARGE ANGLES ARE MEASURED THE TELESCOPE IS NOT SCREWED FAST IN THE SUPPORT AT N BUT TLE PART CONMMONLY MADE TO ADJUST THE COLLIMATION LINE PARALLEL TO THE PLANE OF REFLECTION IS HERE EXTENDED INTO A TUBE M ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG IN WHICH THE TELESCOPE IS SLIDED IN AND OUT ACCORDING TO WHAT THE ANGLE MAY ADMIT AND TO KEEP THE CIR CLE NOT FARTHER FROM THE EYE THAN NECESSARY ON ACCOUNT OF THE EASE OF HOLDING IT THE SCREW I IN THE TE LESCOPE TUBE SLIDES IN THE SLIT OF THIS TUBE TO PREVENT IT FROM TURNING AND THEREBY ALTERING THE DIRECTION OF THE COLLIMATION LINE TOWARDS THE PLANE OF REFLECTION THE DIFFERENT EYE PIECES ARE FITTED IN A SEPARATE TUBE WHICH UNSCREWS AT P FOR THE EASE OF PACKING TO GIVE TO THIS INSTRUMENT THE SAME ADVANTAGE IN FINDING STARS BY NIGHT AS THE CIRCLES OF EIGHTEEN INCHES HAVE THERE IS A LIGHT DIVIDED SEMICIRCLE O O ADAPTED TO THE ALHIDADE DC SUPPORTED IN THE MIDDLE BY A SMALL

ALHIDADE AT A WILL BE ARRESTED BY THEM WHETHER THIS ALHIDADE MOVES ALONE OR WITH THE CIRCLE LTHE OTHER PARTS OF THE INSTRUMENT BEING EXACTLY SIMILAR TO MR TROUGHTONS CIRCLE NEED NOT HERE BE MENTIONED IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT THE CONSTRUCTION AND SHAPE OF THIS INSTRUOF THE UNITED STATES 345 MENT MAY BE VARIED IN DIFFERENT MANNERS WITHOUT ALTERING ITS PRINCIPAL QUALITIES I MADE VARIOUS PLANS BUT IT WOULD BE NEEDLESS TO STATE HERE THEIR VARIETIES METHOD OF OBSERVING WITH THE REPEATING REFLECTING CIRCLE THE ADJUSTMENTS OF THIS INSTRUMENT BEING OF COURSE IN EVE RY RESPECT THE SAME AS THE WELL KNOWN ADJUSTMENTS OF ANY REFLECTING INSTRUMENT MUST NOT BE REPEATED HERE IN ALL RE PEATING INSTRUMENTS ATTENTION IS REQUIRED TO AVOID MISTAK ING IN THE REGULAR COURSE OF ALTERNATING OBSERVATIONS AND USE OF CLAMPS AND SCREWS IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO PROCEED AT FIRST WITH MEASURED AND CAUTIOUS STEPS AND TO FORM A RE GULAR HABIT OF AN ORDER EASY IN THE MANIPULATION WHICH WHEN IT BECOMNES HABITUAL WILL ALWAYS PROCEED MORE SURELY AND RAPIDLY THE EXAMPLES OF OBSERVATIONS GIVEN IN THE EXEM PLAR OF THE DAYBOOK AND JOURNAL WILL PROVE THAT TWO SERIES OF TEN ALTITUDES MAY BE TAKEN IN THE SPACE OF FIVE OR SIX MI NUTES THE CORRESPONDENCE OF OBSERVATIONS WITH THIS INSTRUMENT AND OTHERS WITHI THE EIGLHTEEN INCH REPEATING CIRCLE WHICH I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING AT THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY LINE PROVED THAT THE FORMER WAS CAPABLE OF GIVING AN ACCURACY NEARLY AS GREAT AS THE LATTER THE MOST CONVENIENT ORDER OF PROCEEDING IN A REPEATED DOUBLE SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS IS THE FOLLOWING I PLACE THE VERNIER A UPON O0 OR ANY DESIRED OR ROUND NUMBER AND READ OFF B 2 WRITE THESE READINGS IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH COLUMNS OF THE DAYBOOK VIDE EXETNPLAR 3 THE ALHIDADE DC BEINIG UNCLAMPED MAKE AN OBSERVA TION BY

SAME NUNMBER OF DEGREES 4E 6 INVERT THE INSTRUNMENT EITHER FRONM RIGHT TO LEFT WHEN IN A VERTICAL OBSERVATION OR UPSIDE DOWN IN OTHERPOSITIONS AND UNCLAMPING THE ALHIDADE OF A 6 B NMOVE IT UP TO THE OPPOSITE STOP ON THE SMALL CIRCLE OR IN GENERAL NEAR THE PLACE WHICHI WILL BE INDICATED BY THE READING ON THE SNMALL CIRCLE AND AFTER CLAMPING TLHERE MAKE AGAIN AN OBSERVATION BRING ING THE OBJECTS IN

STAND OF THE ALHIDADE OF A E B IS NOW READ OFF A RESULT IS OBTAINED OF THE FIRST ANGLE OF THIS SERIES TO WLHICH THE TWO TINMES OBSERVED WOULD CORRESPOND AND IN A VERTICAL OBSERVATION ON TTHE MERCURY HORIZON THE ANGLE INDICATED WOULD BE THE DOUBLE ALTITUDE CORRESPONDING TO THE MEAN OF THE TWO TIRNES 9 INVERT THE INSTRUMENT AGAIN TO BRING IT IN THE SAME PO SITION AS FOR THE FIRST OBSERVATION UNCLAMP THE ALHIDADE C D AND NMOVE THE CIRCLE WITH THE LARGE RNIRROR THE ALHIDADE OF WTICHL REMAINS CLAMPED TO IT NEAR TO THE FIRST POSITION OR PLACE OF THE STOP WHERE C IS AGAIN CLAMPED 10 IN THIS

STATES 347 SERIES WOULD BE OBTAINED GIVING AGAIN DIRECTLY THE DOUBLE ALTITUDE CORRESPONDING TO THE NMEAN OF TWO LAST TIMES IF THE OBSERVATION IS A VERTICAL ONE ON A MERCURY HORIZON 12 TO CONTINUE THE SERIES FARTHER THE NEXT OPERATION WILL BE THE MOVING OF THE ALBIDADE A OR THE MIRROR ALONE AS IN NO 6 AND THE ALTERNATION MAY BE CONTINUED AS FAR AS DE SIRED THE LAST OBSERVATION BEING ALWAYS ONE OF THE SAMIE KIND AS THAT FIRST NMADE IN ORDER TO GIVE TO BOTH SERIES THE SAME NUMBER OF ANGLES 13 THE TIMES BELONGING TO THE FIRST SERIES A 4 B WILL BE ALL THIE TIMES OBSERVED EXCEPT THE LAST AND THE TIMES OF THE SERIES C 8 D ALL THE TIMES EXCEPT THE FIRST AS IN THE REPEATING CIRCLE WITH TWO TELESCOPES AND THE CALCULATION OF EACH SERIES WILL BE SEPARATE IF THE ANGLE OBSERVED SHOULD INCREASE DURING THE OBSERVA TION AS IN OBSERVING TIME FOR INSTANCE IT WILL BE PROPER TO ATTEND OCCASIONALLY TO THE STOPS THAT THEY MAY NOT BE TOO NEAR SO AS TO OCCASION THEMII TO BE TOUCHED BY THE ALHIDADE AND DISTURB THE READINGS IN OBSERVING THE SUN THESE STOPS ARE BEST REMOVED TO THE END OF THE CIRCLE IN KEEPING FAST THE CLAMP OF THE ALHIDADE C WHICH HOLDS THE CIRCLE AND MOVING ONLY THE MIRROR THE INSTRUMENT WILL PERFORM EXACTLY THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS MR TROUGHTONS CIR CLE BY THE SINGLE CROSS OBSERVATION AND IN DETERMINING THE POINT OF PARALLELISM OF THE MIRRORS THE SAME OBSERVATIONS MAY BE MADE AS WITLH A SEXTANT BUT IN THESE THE INSTRUMENT LOSES NOT ONLY ITS PECULIAR ADVANTAGES BUT EVEN WOULD NOT SERVE SO WELL AS A SEXTANT WHICBH IS LIGHTER AND ITS PARTS PUR POSELY CALCULATED FOR SOLIDITY IN THIS KIND OF OBSERVATIONS LF IN TERRESTRIAL ANGLES THE TWO OBJECTS OBSERVED SHOULD BE EQUALLY WELL ILLUMINATED SO THAT THE EQUALISATION OF LIGLHT COULD BE MADE CONSTANT THE ALTERNATION OF THE ANGLES CAN BE EFFECTED WITHOUT INVERTING THE INSTRUMENT BY CHANGING AL TERNATELY TTHE OBJECT TO BE VIEWED DIRECTLY BY WHICH THE OTHER WILL BE BROUGHT TO ALTERNATE EQUALLY WITH THE POSITION OF THE MIRROR TO RECEIVE THE REFLECTION AND THE INICONVENIENT POSI TION OF THE HAND OR THE CHANGE OF HANDLES IS AVOIDED348 SURVEY OF THE COAST DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANE TABLE AND THE ALHIDADE TO THE SAME THE BEST METHOD OF SURVEYING THE MINUTE DETAILS WHICLH ARE TO FILL UP A TRIANGULATION IS UNDOUBTEDLY BY THE PLANIE TA BLE AND ITS ALBIDADE WITLH A TELESCOPE REVOLVING IN THE VERTI CAL THIS METHOD WILL GIVE TO THE DETAIL SURVEYOR THE FULL RESULT OF THE TRIANGULATION WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIVE POSI TION AND DISTANCES OF THE POINTS TO BE DETERMINED IN A ME CHANICAL FORM APPROPRIATED TO THE NATURE OF HIIS WORK AND WHICH WILL NOT ONLY BE A GUIDE AND REFERENCE BUT ALSO A MEANS OF ENABLING HIM TO DETERMINE HIS DISTANCES AND TO VE RIFY HIS WORK CONSTANTLY AS HE PROCEEDS AND BY REVIEWING THE FUNDAMENTAL POINTS TO DISCOVER AN ERROR IMNMEDIATELY BEFORE IT MAY MISLEAD HIM THE DETAIL SURVEYOR CAN THERE FORE PROCEED WITLH CONFIDENCE AND CELERITY AND HIS WORK WILL BE GREATLY DIMNINISHED BY THIS METHOD AS WELL AS BY SAVING ALL THE WORK COMMONLY CALLED PLOTTING NECESSARY IN ALL OTHER METHODS WHICH BESIDES INTRODUCES NEW ERRORS WHILE THOSE MADE IN THE FIELD REMAIN CONCEALED UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE TO CORRECT THEM PROPERLY THE PLAN OF THE TRIANGULATION BEING PROPERLY ADAPTED WILL BESIDES BE MADE AT ONCE SUFFICIENTLY BY THE MERE PROJECTION OF THE TRIANGULATION AS WILL BE OBSERVED IN ITS PROPER PLACE THE DETAILS BEING INTRODUCED IN THE FIELD IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE EYE WILL BE MUCH MORE NIUMEROUS MIORE ACCURATE AND NATURAL SO THAT TO A MAN ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUBJECT IT WILL BE EASY TO DISTINGUISH DETAILS AND PLANS SURVEYED BY THIS ME THOD FIOM THOSE TAKEN BY THE THEODOLITE OR THE NEEDLE THE LAST OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS THE WORST THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED FOR THE PURPOSE AND HAS PROBABLY BEEN TRANSFERRED TO LAND ONLY FROM ITS USE AT SEA AS A HIISTORICAL PR OOF OF THESE ASSER TIONS I SHALL ONLY MENTION THAT THE PLANE TABLE HAS BEEN USED IN THE SURVEYS MADEIN EAST INDIA BY THE EAST INDIA COMPANVOF THE UNITED STATES 349 UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A GERMAN AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE AD VANTAGES FOR WHICH I GAVE IT THE PREFERENCE IN THIS WORK THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ALHIDADE ARE SIMPLE IT MAY

CONTRIVANCE IT IS ABOUT FIFTEEN INCHES LONG AND OF ABOUT AN INCH AND A QUARTER APERTURE IT SLIDES FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS IN A TUBE 1 1 OF FOUR INCHES IN LENGTH FIXED TO THE SQUARE CENTRE PIECE AND MAY BY THAT MEANS BE PLACED IN EQUILIBRIUM SO AS TO REMAIN IN ALL PO SITIONS BY THE MERE FRICTION OF THE AXIS IN ITS SUPPORTS AND THIE LEVEL HOOKS LN ONE OF THE SUPPORTS IS THE ADJUSTMENT FOR LEVELLING THE AXIS OF THE TELESCOPE BY A CAPSTAN HEAD SCREW I I THERE IS EXPRESSLY NO HORIZONTAL ADJUSTMNENT FOR THIS AXIS TO EFFECT THE PARALLELISM OF THE VERTICAL PLANE OF THE TELESCOPE WITH THE SIDES OF THE RULE BECAUSE THIS IS INTENDED TO BE FIXED AND ADJUSTEDL BY THE PROPER FILING OF THE YS IN THE SUPPORTS OR THE PLACING OF THE FRAME D D ON THE COLUMNS C C VOL IIZ2350 SURVEY OF THE COAST BEFORE THE OBJECT END OF THE TELESCOPE THERE IS A LIGHT LENGTHENING TUBE OF THREE INCHES IN LENGTH TO KEEP THE SIDE LIGHT AND GLARE FOROM THE OBJECT GLASS WHICH IS VERY NECESSARV IN THIS INSTRUMNENT THE EYE PART OF THE TELESCOPE IS IN A LONG TUBE SLIDING IN THE NAIN TUBE BY SLIDING IT IN AND OUT THE WIRES ARE PLACED IN THE FOCUS OF THE OBJECT GLASS AND BY TURNING IT IN THE TUBE THEY ARE PLACED PERPENDICULAR TRHERE ARE THREE VERTICAL AND ONE HORIZONTAL WIRES THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE VERTICAL WIRES IS FOR THE OBSERVATIONS OF TRANSITS OF CELESTIAL BODIES IN OBSERVING TRANSITS BY WHICH A SURVEY MAY BE PROPERLY ORIENTED OR A TRUE MERIDIAN DRAWN IN IT TRHE EYE PIECES MNAY BE CHOSEN AT THE PLEASURE OF THE OBSERVER AND IN RESPECT TO THEIR NMAGNIFYING POWER THEY MUST BE ADAPTED TO THE MIDDLE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECTS WLHICH MAY COME UNDER OBSERVATION IT IS THEREFORE PROPER TO HAVE SE VERAL CHANGES AND IT WILL BE VERY CONVENIENT TO HAVE ONE PRISMATIC WHICHI BEING PLACED SO AS TO LOOK UPWARDS WILL SERVE FOR OBJECTS AT SUICH AN ELEVATION AS WILL NOT EASILY ALLOW ROOM FOR THE HEAD BETWEEN THE PLANE OF THE TABLE AND THE EYE PIECE AND IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER TO GIVE TO THE INSTRU MENT TOO GREAT AN ELEVATION IN ITS CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE IT WOULD AFFECT THE STABILITY OF THE VERTICAL PLANE OF THE TELE SCOPE THE SPIRIT LEVEL K LHANGS TO THE AXIS BY HOOKS AND HAS PROPER ADJUSTMENTS IT SERVES FOR THE LEVELLING OF THE AXIS OF THE TELESCOPE AND THE PLANE TABLE ITSELF THE METHIOD OF USING IT IS TOO EVIDENT AND SIMPLE TO BE DETAILED HIERE AS THIS INSTRUMENT WILL IN ITS USE BE PLACED ON DIFFERENIT PARTS OF THE PLANE TABLE IT BECOMES A DESIRABLE OBJECT THAT IT SHLOULD BE AS LIGHT AS MAY BE CONSISTENT WVITH ITS NECESSARY SOLIDITY IN ORDER THAT IT MAY NOT AFFECT THE LEVEL OF THE PLANE TABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE THE LARGE RULE IS CUT OUT AS SEEN IN FIG 2 SO AS TO FOIM ONLY A SKELETON TO THE OUTER STRAIGHTT LINE AND THIE SUPPORTS OF THE TELESCOPE IN LIKE MANNER THE FRAME D D AND THE SUPPORTS E E ARE CUT OUT SO THAT THE INOF THE UNITED STATES 35T STRUMNENT IS RENDERED VERY LIGHT AND AT THE SAME TIME VERY SOLID BY THE ILATURE OF ITS FRAMING IT MAY BE USEFUL TO GIVE HIERE THE DESCRIPTION OF AN ADDI TION WHICH THIS INSTRUMENT ADMITS AND BY WHICH IT ANSWERS THE PURPOSE OF A VERY GOOD GONIOMETER IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE PILLARS C C IS A SOCKET WHICH RECEIVES AN AXIS OF AT LEAST ONE INCH IN LENGTH AND ABOUT ONE TLHIRD OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AT BOTH ENDS OF THE RULE A 6 B THERE ARE TWO VERY THIN PIECES EITHER ADDED TO THE END EDGES OR WORKED OUT IN IT IN WLHICH TWO POINTS ARE MADE AT EQUAL DISTANCES FROMN THE CENTRE AND DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE TO EACH OTLHER ANOTHER RULE SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE AND OF EQUAL BREADTH AND LENGTH IS KEPT FROM BEINDING BELOW BY AN EDGE BAR TAPER ING FROM THE CENTRE TOWARDS THE TWO ENDS THIS HAS IN ITS MIDDLE THE STEEL AXIS TO THE SOCKET OF THE OTHER RULE WHICH IS PUT UPON IT AND HELD BY A SCREW FROM ABOVE WHEN THE IN STRUNIENT IS TO BE USEDL AS A GONIOMETER IN THE MIDDLE BELOW TLE RULE IS A CENTRE PIECE EITHER SQUARE OR ROUND WITHI A SCREW SUFFICIENTLY SOLID TO HOLD WELL AND ADAPTABLE TO ANY STAND WHICH WILL OF COURSE BE CONVE NIENTLY CONTRIVED SO AS TO SUIT THE MOTION WORK OF THE PLANE TABLE THIS TABLE WILL BE DESCRIBED HEREAFTER A LECIMAL SCALE WILL THEN BE CONSTRUCTED ON THE RADIUS OF THE INSTRUMENT CONSIDERED AS A UNIT WLHICH THEREFORE MAY BE CHOSEN SO AS TO SERVE AT THE SAME TIME AS A SCALE FOR THE PLANE TABLE OPERATIONS THE CORDS MUST BE MEASURED BY A BEAM COMPASS OF PROPER LENGTH LC THE NUMBERS ON THE SCALE MAY BE MNARKED AT ONE HALF THEIR VALUE SO THAT WHEN THE CORD MEASURED BY THE BEAM COMPASS IS APPLIED TO IT THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY INDICATE THE SIZE OF HALF THE ANGLE WHICH BEING TAKEN FROM A TALBLE OF NATURAL SINES WILL GIVE THE AN GLES WITH GREAT EASE AND IF PROPER CARE IS TAKEN WITH CORISI DERABLE ACCURACY THE LEVELLING AND ALL ADJUSTMENTS OF THIS INSTRUMENT ARE OF COURSE EXACTLY THE SANME AS VHEN USED ON THE PLANE TABLE352 SURVEY OF THE COAST THE MEASURING OF THE ANGLES CAN OF COURSE BE VARIED AND THE CORDS OF THE TWO VERTICAL ANGLES CAN ALWAYS BE MEASURED AND IN MANY CASES THE SUPPLEMENTS IT WILL LE MORE PROPER TO LET EVERY ANGLE BE COMPOSED OF TWO GIVEN BY THE CORDS OF TWO ANGLES GOING OFF FROM A FIXED POSITION OF THE LOWER RULE THAN TO PLACE THE LOWER RULE TOGETHER WITH THE UPPER UPON A POINT WITH THEIR POIRNTS PLACED UPON EACH OTHER INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS I HAVE NOW DESCRIBED AT LENGTH I LHAD EXECUTED IN 1792 BY THE EXACT ARTIST DEVELEY IN LAUSANNE IN SWITZERLAND FOR THE SURVEYORS OF

THE PLANE TABLE ITSELF OUGHT TO BE ABOUT THIRTY INCHES BY TWENTYFOUR IN SIZE AS LIGHT AS IT CAN BE NMADE CONSISTENTLY WITH SOLIDITY IT INAY ON THAT ACCOUNT BE PROPER TO HAVE IT PANNELLED I LHAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT OLD PINE BOARD WHICH HAD SERVED LONG AS DOORS OR HOUSE FURNITURE 6C WAS THE BEST MATERIAL FOR IT THE SIZE ABOVE MENTIONED ALLOWS PA PERS OF SUCH DIMENSION AS WILL BE FOUND ADVANTAGEOUS WHILE A SMIALL TABLE WILL INTRODUCE INACCURACY BY THE NECESSITY OF CHANGING OFTEN AND ADJUSTING MANY PAPERS FOR THE SAME REASONS PLANE TABLES WITH FRAMES TO STRETCH THE PAPER UPON ARE TO BE REJECTED TLHE PAPER MUST BE ALLOWED TO BE OF GREAT LENGTHI  ANID A BREADTH OF THREE FEET AND A HALF MAY WELL BE PLACED ON THE TABLE OF THIRTY INCHES IN ONE DIRECTION IT IS GOOD TO LHAVE THE EDGES

THIS PENDULUM IS WELL KNOWN BY THE NAME OF THE MERCU RY COMPENSATION PENDULUTN  AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT WAS THE ONLY ONE ADAPTED TO MY PURPOSE AS I WAS UNICERTAIN IN WHAT LATITUDE TLLE OBSERVATORIES

THE ROD ITSELF IT MNUST THEREFORE BE DETERMINED BY EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION AS A ROD COMPENSATING ITSELF EXACTLY IN A PYRO METER WOULD NOT FOR THAT COMPENSATE EVERY CLOCK AND THESE CLOCKS WOULD NOT BE COMPENSATED BY IT ON ACCOUNT OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE TEMPERATUIRE UPON THE SCAPEMENT SPRINGS THE JEWELLING OF THE LARGER PINION HOLES OF A CLOCK DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE OF ANY ADVANTAGE THE

INTENTION TO MAKE THE WEIGLHT ALWAYS MOVE AT SOME DISTANCE EVEN BELOW THE LENIS OF THIE PENDULUM TO AVOID THE TOO GREAT INFLUENCE OF IT UPOIN THE PENDULUN PARTICULALYLL IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE LENS AS IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT THE CLOCK WILL ALWAYS CHANGE ITS RATE OF GOING IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE MUTUAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE LENS AND THE WEIGHT IN CLOCKS WHICH GO ONLY TWENTYFOUR HOURS AS THOSE DE SCRIBED ABOVE WHICH ARE ALWAYS WOUND UP AT REGUILAR TIMES THIS INFLUENCE OCCURRING EVERY DAY EQUALLY WILL ON THE WLHOLE COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE INTERMEDIATE DEVIATIONS OCCASION ED BY IT WILL REMAIN CONCEALED AS THE CLOCK WILL ALWAVS BE REGULATED ACCORDING TO ITS MEAN DAILY RATE IT APPEARS THERE FORE THE MOST EVIDENT IN THOSE CLOCKS WHICH GO A LONG TIME WITH ONE WINDING ON A FRANKLIN CLOCK WHICH I PUT UP AT WEST POINT IN 1808 AND WHICH SHOWS ONLY FOUR HOURS AND WENT FORTY DAYS WITH ONE WINDING THE PENDULUM WAS COM PLETELY STOPPED WHEN THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF THE WEIGHT WAS ABOUT TEN INCHES BELOW THAT OF THE LENS THEIR HORIZONTAL DIS TANCE BEING THREE INCHES AND A QUARTER THE WEIGHT AND LENS BOTH WERE CONSIDERABLY HEAVY TRO COUNTERACT THIS MUTUAL INFLUENCE I HUNG A MUSKET BALL BY A THIN WIRE FROM THE BOARD ON WHICH THE CLOCK RESTED TO THE POINT WHERE THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF THE WEIGHT WAS WHEN THE CLOCK STOPPED AND IN A FEW SECONDS IT BEGAN TO OS CILLATE ISOCHRONOUS WITLH THE PENDULUN THESE TWO EXPERITNENTS I REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES WITH EX ACTLY EQUAL RESULTS AND THOUGH I ATTRIBUTED THE STOPPING OF THE CLOCK TO A SMIALL DEFECT IN ITS POSITION I MADE THE WEIGHTOF THE UNITED STATES 365 TO GO IN FUTURE BELOW THIS STOPPING POINT AND I TNEVER WOUND IT UP AS FAR AS THAT POINT THIS REDUCED ITS TIME OF GOING TILL THE WEIGHT RESTED ON THE FLOOR TO FOURTEEN DAYS AND ALSO DESTROYED THE EFFECT OF THE ATTRACTION OF THE LENSAND WEIGHT THE PLACEMENT OF THE CLOCKS HERE DESCRIBED REQUIRES GREAT CARE ATTENTION TO SOLIDITY AND VARIOUS PECULIAR ARRANIGEMENTS WHICLH CANNOT BE DESCRIBED HERE WITHOUT SUCH ARRANGE MNENTS THEY WOULD BE SPOILED IMMEDIATELY AND DISAPPOINT THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH ARE WITH REASON ENTERTAINED OF THEM PLAN OF AN OBSERVATORY PROPOSED TO BE BUILT IN WASKIINGTON IN MY PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE SURVEY I PROPOSED THE ERECTION OF TWO OBSERVATORIES IN SUCH PLACES AS MIGHT BE FOUND MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IT SEEMED EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE USE OF THESE ESTABLISHMENTS MIGHT BE EXTENDED TO OBJECTS OF GENERAL SCIENTIFIC IMPROVEMENT INDEPENDENT OF THE SURVEY WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERABLE INCREASE OF EXPENSE  AND MY VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT WERE SUPPORTED BY THE APPROBATION OF MANY EMINENT MEN IN PUBLIC LIFE WHEN I RENDERED IN THE ACCOUTNTS OF MY NMISSION FOR THE INSTRUMENTS IN JUNE 1816 THE PRESIDENT MR MADISON AS WELL AS THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY MR DALLAS WERE AS DESIROUIS AS I WAS THAT THIS PART OF MY PLAN MIGHT RECEIVE ITS IMMEDIATE EXECUTION I THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT ONE OF THESE OBSERVATORIES SLHOULD BE LOCATED AT THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT AND MNANY CONSIDERATIONS LED MIE TO SELECT FOR THIS PURPOSE A PART OF THE HILL NORTH OF THE CAPITOL AND IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH IT WOUILD BE USELESS TO RELATE HERE PREVENTED THE EXECUTION OF THIS PROJECT BUT STILL IT MAY BE PROPER TO GIVE THE PLAN AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED OBSERVATORY AS THEY ARE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE SUBJECT VOLE 13 B366 SURVEY OF THE COASR OF

UNITED STATES 369 ACROSS WITHIOUT TAKING SO MUCH LIGHT FROM THE TELESCOPE AS TO PRODUCE ANY IMPEDIMENT THE EASY MOTION OF THESE SHUTTERS AND THEIR CLOSE SHUT TING AGAINST DRIFTING SNOW PARTICULARLY IS AN OBJECT TO BE AT TENDED TO CAREFULLY WHICH CANNOT BE DESCRIBED HERE THE SECOND INSTRUMENT FOR WHICH A SEPARATE STAND WAS TO BE PREPARED IN THE OBSERVATORY WAS THE ZENITH SECTOR THIS WAS INTENDED TO BE PLACED UPON THE CONIC PILLAR D AND TO LHAVE A LARGE AND SUITABLE APERTURE IN THE ROOF LIKE THAT FOR THE TRANSIT BTUT AS THE ZENITH SECTOR IS NOT YET OBTAINED ALL AR RANGEMENTS COULD BE MERELY PREPARATORY AND THEY COULD ONLY BE WELL ADAPTED WHEN THE INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE AT LHANID WHEN AT ANY FUTURE TIME A MURAL CIRCLE SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE OBSERVATORY THIS WAS INTENDED TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE SECTOR AND TTHE ROOF BETWEEN THE CORRESPONDING WINDOWS TO BE OPENED AS FOR THE TRANSIT THE SECTOR WOULD THEN BE REMOVED TO THE CORRESPONDING SITUATION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRANSIT WHERE NOW THE OBSERVERS AND GUARD ROOMS WERE PLACED THE PARTITION BEING TAKEN AWAY AND AN ADDITION OF ONE OR TWO WINDOWS BREADTH BEING MADE TO THE EAST OF THE BUILD ING TO PROVIDE THESE NECESSARY ROOMS TRHE

THE END OF THE LAST CENTURY SURPASSED THOSE OF THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE THEY HAVE FREQUENTLY SUPPLIED THE LATTER WITHI IN STRUMENTS OF VARIOUS DESCRIPTIONS BUT THE INIPROVEMENTS TO WHICH SCIENCE HAS GIVEN RISE ON THE CONTINENT THE DELAYS OC CASIONED BY THE DISTANCE AND THE SEPARATION OCCASIONED BY THE EVENTS OF THE LAST TWENTYEIGHT YEARS HAVE ESTABLISHED THIS BRANCH OF THE ARTS AGAIN ON THE

MANUAL LABOUR TRHEIR DIAMETERS ARE THREE FEET TO AVOID THE SPRING OF THE METAL MR REICHENBACH IN MUNICH REFUSES TO MAKE ANY IN STRUMNENTS OF GREATER DIANMETER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE BEND OR SPRING TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT THE ENGLISH PREFER SUCH CONSTRUCTIONS AS ADMIT OF TURNING TRHEY AVOID THE MANUAL LABOUR OF FILINIG AND THEREFORE COM POSE ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF LARGE DIARNETERS OF PIECES THAT

IN ANY GIVEN CASE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE NATURE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE PARTICULAR BRANCHES IN WHICH EACH ARTIST IS MOST DISTINGUISHED THAT A PREFERENCE MAY BE GIVEN TO SUCH AS WILL BE LIKELY TO

CONSTRUCTION OF CHRONO METERS ASTRONOMICAL CLOCKS ARE NOTKEPT FOR SALE AS CHRONOME TERS ARE THERE ARE BUT A FEW CONSTRUCTED AND THOSE AGREE ABLY TO ORDER ONLY AS TO CHRONOMETERS IT IS HARDLY TO BE EXPECTED THAT AMONG THIE GREAT NUMBERS KEPT ON HAND BY DIFFERENT ARTISTS THERE SHOULD NOT BE SOME OF THEM PREFERABLE TO OTHERS IF THERE FORE SEVERAL CHRONOMETERS BE REQUIRED AS WAS MY CASE IT WILL BE PROPER TO TAKE THEM FROM DIFFERENT ARTISTS IN ORDER TO HAVE A GREATER CHANCE OF SUCCESS WHICH NO ARTIST CAN INVA RIABLY ATTACH TO HIS WORK IT NMUST BE OBSERVED FROM THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH CHRO NOMETERS ARE CONSTRUCTED THAT THEY WILL GO DIFFERENTLY AT SEA FROM WHAT THEY DO ON LAND IHIS I HAVE PROVED BY SE VEN CHRONOMETERS WHICH I KEPT GOING ON MY PASSAGE FROM LONDON TO PHILADELPHIA AND WHICH I COMPARED TOGETHER DAI LY IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE CONSTANT INOTION OF THE SHIP MUST AFFECT THE HEAVY BALANCE WHICH IS NEVER AFLECTED WHEN THE CHRONOMETER IS COMPLETELV AT REST THE QUANTITY OF THIS EF FECT IS OF COURSE BOTH UNCERTAIN AND PECULIAR TO EACH CHRO NOMETER BOTH IN RESPECT TO QUANTITY AND DIRECTION VOL I13 C374 SURVEY OF THE COAST THE DELICACY OF THE SCAPEMENT MAY BE THE CAUSE WHY

GENERALLY SPEAKING AS SUCCESSFUL AS THE ENGLISH THE PRINCIPLES UPON WLHICH THEY WORK ARE ALSO DIFFERENIT BUT THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO ENTER INTO DETAILS ON THIS SUBJECT IT IS ONLY PROPER TO MENTION THAT IN CASE REPAIRS OR EVEN CLEANING SHOULD BE NECESSARY IN A CHRONOMETER IT CAN SELDOM BE EXPECTED THAT ANLY OTHER CHRONOMETER MAKER WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT SO WELL AS HE WHO HAS MADE THE INSTRUMENT

DAY ALL THAT GO FOR A LONGER PERIOD HAVE BY NO MEANS THE SAME DEGREE OF ACCURACY IT IS PROBABLE THAT ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THIS ARISES FROM THE TOO GREAT INFLUENCE OF THE INEQUALITIES OF THE SPRINGS WHICH MUST OF COURSE EXTENDOVER A LONGER SPACE OF TIME AS IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTY IN THE DI VISION OF MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENTS CONSISTS NOW IN THE PRO PER CENTRING OF THE DIVISION WITH THE AXIS OF MOTION IT MNAY BE PROPER TO MENTION THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS IS EFFECTED AND TO GIVE AN IDEA OF A DIVIDING ENGINE BY WHICH THIS ERROR MAY BE AVOIDED AND WHICH 1 COMUMUNICATED TO MR TROUGH TON HE APPROVED OF IT SO FULLY THAT HE ADVISED MR THOOF THE UNITED STATES 375 NRAS JONES WLHO MADE SEVERAL OF THE INSTRMTIENTS HERE DE SCRIBED TO MAKE HIIS DIVIDING ENGINIE UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH I INDICATED WHEN THE INSTRUMENT COMES FROM THE HANIDS OF THE FIRST WORKMAN IT IS TECHNICALLY SAID TO BE TIGHT OR FITTED SO AS TO ADMNIT LITTLE OR NO MOTION OF ITS AXIS VFLHEI THE CIRCLE INTEND ED TO BE DIVIDED WITH ITS AXIS SCREWED TO IT IS PUT IN A LATHE TO RECEIVE THLE LAST ADJUSTING TURNING BOTH WITLH RESPECT TO THTE AXIS AND THIE PLANE OF THE CIRCLE FOR THIS PURPOSE IT MUST TURN UPON TWO POINTS MAKING PART OF THE PROTRACTED AXIS AS IT WOULD NOT TURN SUFFICIENTLY CONCENTRIC IN ANY COTMMNON LATLHE ARRANGEMENT WITH CLHUCKS A TEMPORAARY PULLEY IS FIXED TO SOME CONVENIENT PART FOR THE CORDS OF THE WHEEL TO RUN IN THE MOTION SHOULD BE SLOW AND STEADY TO AVOID ALL VACIL LATION AND SWINGING THEREFORE THIE WHEEL IS SMALL CORN MNOILDY ONE OF THOSE USED WITH THE HAND LATHE AND IT IS TURNED REGULARLY BY A SEPARATE PERSONI BY HAND WLHEN THE AXIS AND THE PLANE OF THE CIRCLE ARE THUS FINALLY TURNED TRUE AND BEFORE ANY THING IS CHANIGED IN THE ARRANGE MENTS THOSE CIRCLES BETWEEN WHICH THE DIVISIONS ARE TO BE DRAWNI ARE IMMEDIATELY TURNED UPON THE PLANE OF THE INSTRU MENT BY THE PRESSUIRE OF A FINE POINT HELD IN A POSITION IN CLINED TO ITS MOTION AT ABOUT AN ANGLE OF TEN DEGREES SO THAT NO ACTUAL CUTTING TAKES PLACE THESE CIRCLES ARE PERFECTLY CONCENITRIC WITH THE AXIS AND ARE DESCRIBED BETTER ON A SILVER ARCH THAN ONE OF BRASS ON ACCOUNIT OF ITS MORE UNIFORM TEX TURE ANID THE EASE WITH WHICLH IT RECEIVES SUCH AN IMPRESSION THE INSTRUMENT BEING NOW TAKEN FROM THE LATHE THE SOCKET OF THE AXIS FINISHED IN THE SAME MANNER IS RUBBED UPON IT WITH EMERY AND OIL BY A KIND OF SCREWING MOTION UNTIL AN EASY AND EVEN MIIOTION IS OBTAINED THIS 4TURNING FOLLOWING ALWAYS THE CONICAL SURFACES BY CLOSE CONTACT HAS NO SENSIBLE TENDENCY TO CHANGE THE CENTRE THE PRESENT CONSTRUCTION OF THE FNIGLISH DIVIDING ENGINES REQUIRES AN OPERATION WHICHL MNAKES THE CENTRE OF THE DIVISION DEPEND ON THE MOTION OF THE AXIS IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE 2376 SURVEY OF THE COAST THE AXIS OUT OF THE CIRCLE TO ADAPT THIS LATTER TO THE ENGINE AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THE AXIS BE SCREWED AGAIN EXACTLY IN ITS POSITION 5C THE DIVIDING ENGINES HAVE ALL A CETNTRE PIN TO WHICH THE INSTRUMENT IS CENTRED THESE PINS ARE EITHER FIXED OR CHANGEABLE FOR DIFFERENT DIAMETERS OF AXES SUITED TO THE USUAL AND COMNMON INSTRUMENTS TRO ADAPT ANY INSTRUMENT HIAVING A CENTRAL APERTURE FOR AN AXIS DIFFERENT FROM THESE A COLLAR IS TURNED HAVING ITS OUTER DIAMETER TO FIT THIS APERTURE AND ITS CENTRAL HOLE THE CENTRE PIN OF THE ENGINE BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE CONCENTRICITY OF THESE TWO CIRCLES IS NOT ALWAYS CER TAIN AND THAT IN THE LAST TURNING ABOVE MNENTIONED THE CENTRE MAY HAVE BEEN DISPLACED FROMN THE CENTRE OF THE APERTURE WHICH RECEIVES THE AXIS AND WHICH WAS OF COURSE NOT TURNED WITH IT THE DIVISION BEING COMPLETED THE AXIS IS AGAIN SCREWED IN ITS PLACE AND THE ADJUSTMENT OF IT IS TO BE MADE BOTHI WITH RESPECT TO ITS CONCENTRICITY AND ITS PERPENIDICULARITY TO THE CIRCLE THE READING OF OPPOSITE VERNIERS OR MICROSCOPES MUST INDICATE THE CORRECTIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO GIVE THE AXIS ITS PROPER POSITION IT IS NECESSARY TO RAISE THIREE BURRS WITH A PUNCHING TOOL AT SUCH PLACES AS APPEAR TO RE QUIRE IT BY REPEATED TRIALS OF THIS KIND THE AXIS IS AGAIN CENTRED AND THIS OPERATION IS TO BE DISCONTINUED WHEN A SUF FICIENT APPROXIMATION IS OBTAINED WHEN AN INSTRUMENT HAS TO BE REMOVED TO A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THESE BURRS MAY WEAR OUT BY THE GREATER PRESSURE THEY SUSTAIN AND THE IN STRUMENT MNAY BECOME ECCENTRIC BY IT ALL THIS TROUBLESOME OPERATION AND THE DISADVANTAGES AT TENDING IT MNAY EASILY BE AVOIDED IF INSTEAD OF THE PIN OR AXIS THE DIVIDING MACHINE HAD IN THE CENTRE A CIRCULAR HOLE OF ABOUT FIVE INCHES DIAMETER AND OF SUFFICIENT DEPTH TO AD MIT THE LOWER PARTS OF THE AXIS OF ANY INSTRUMENT SO THAT THE INSTRUMENT COULD BE PLACED UPON THE ENGINE TOGETHER WITH THE AXIS IN THE SAME SITUATION AS IT CAME FROM THE LAST TURNING AND RUBBING WITHOUT ANY DISMOUNTING WHATEVER TO EASE THE APPROXIMATE PLACING OF THE CIRCLE ON THE ENGINE A NUMOF THE UNITED STATES 377 BER OF CONCENTRIC CIRCLES OF PROPER DIAMETERS COULD BE DRAWN UPON THE PLATE THE AXIS OF THE ENGINES BEING GENERALLY VERY STRONG WOULD EASILY ADMIT THE NECESSARY APERTURE IN THE CENTRE AND IT MIGHT FOR THAT PURPOSE HAVE AN OUTER DIAMETER OF SEVEN INCHES WITHOUT IMPEDING ITS EASY MOTION IN THE MANNER IN WHIICH THE ENGINE IS OTHERWISE MADE AND USED ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE ENGINE WOULD BE EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF MR TRROUGHTON AS DESCRIBED IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BREWSTER ART GRADUATION THE CIRCLE INTENDED FOR DIVIDING BEING LAID UPON THE EN GINE WITH ITS AXIS FAST TO IT AND CENTRED APPROXIMATELY BY ANY ONE OF THE CIRCLES A COMPOUND NMICRONMETER MICROSCOPE IS PLACED BETWEENI THE TWO BARS AT THE PLACE OF THE CUTTING TOOL HAVING ITS WIRES SO PLACED AS TO FORM ONE OR MORE TANGENTS TO THE CIRCLE DRAWN ON THE INSTRUMENT FOR THE LIMITS OF THE DIVISIONS THE INSTRUMENT WILL EVIDENTLY BE CENTRED WHEN THE WIRE OF THE MICROSCOPE TOUCHES THIS CIRCLE ALWAYS IN THE REVOLUTION OF THE ENGINE UPON ITS AXIS AS LONG THEREFORE AS THIS DOES NOT TAKE PLACE THE POSITION IS TO BE CORRECTED HALF BY MOVING THE INSTRUMENT PROPERLY UPON THE ENGINE AND HALF BY BRINGING THE MICROSCOPE OR ITS WIRES NEARER TO OR FARTHER FROM THE CENTRE AND THE DIFFERENT CIRCLES UPON THE INSTRU MENT MAY SERVE TO VERIFY EACH OTHER WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS THUS ADJUSTED UPON THE ENGINE IT MAY BE FASTENED BY VARIOUS MEANS IF MELTED WAX BE CAST ABOUT THE PARTS BY WHICH THE INSTRUMENT IS SUPPORTED IT WILL BE SUFLICIENT TO KEEP IT STEADY DURING THE TIME REQUIRED FOR DIVIDING AND WILL NIOT DERANGE IT BY ANY UNEQUAL PRESSURE IN THE PRESENLT IMPROVED STATE OF THE DIVIDING ENGINE OF MR TROUGHTON ACCIDENTAL ERRORS OF THE DIVISIONS ARE SCARCELY POSSIBLE IF DUE ATTENTION BE PAID TO THE PROPER STABILITY OF ALL THE MOVEABLE PARTS AND THE REGULARITY OF TREADING SO THAT NO TOOTH OF THE RACKING WHVEEL MAY BE PASSED OVER AND THAT THE TRACER NAY NOT ADMIT ANY VACILLATION IN ITS ADJUSTMENTS THE TRACER OF MR TROUGHTON IS BETTER THAN THE ROUND POINT COMNMONLY USED IT IS GROUIND BELOW TO AN ELLIPTIC SECTION OF378 SURVEY ORF THE COAST WHICH THE LONGER DIAMETER IS IN THE DIRECTIOIN OF THE LINES AND THE SHORTER PERPENDICULAR TO THE SAME RHE INTERSEC TION OF THESE TWO LINES FORMS BELOW A SHORT AND SHARP EDGE WHICLH CUTS WITLH SUCH EASE AND KEENNESS THAT ON SILVER THE TOOL CANNOT EVEN BE LEFT TO PRESS WITH ITS FULL WEIGHT AND ON BRASS ITS WEIGLHT ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE A DEEP AND SHARP LY DEFINED LINE IN ONIE STROKE IHE VERNIERS MAY BE EASILY DIVIDED BY PLACING THEM ON THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF AT SUCH A PROPORTIONAL DISTANCE WITHIN THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE AS THE PART SHALL BE INTO WHICI THEY ARE TO DIVIDE A SUBDIVISION OF THE INSTRUMENT AND THEN DIVIDING AS USUAL THIS PRODUCES EVIDENTLY WHEN THEY ARE REMOVED TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE THE LOSS OF ONE DIVISION UPON THIEIR FULL LENIGTH IN THEIR COMXPARISON WITH THE DIVISIONS OF THE CIRCLE ON THE DIVIDING ENGINE WITH A TANGENT SCREW THIS DIVISION CAN BE MADE BY THE MERE ADJUSTMIIENT OF ITS RE VOLUTIONS ON SORNE OF MY INSTRUMENTS THE PIN HOLES WHICH SERVED FOR THIS OPERATION ANDL WVIICH ARE USUALLY FILLED UP AGAIN ARE LEFT OPEN THAT A VERNIER MAY BE IESTORED AGAIN FIOM THE DI VISION OF THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF IF NEED SHOULD BE IT MAY NOT BE IMPROPER HERE TO MENTION SOME OF THE DE TAILS WHICH ARE TO BE OBSERVED IN THE CHOICE OF INSTRUMENTS OR IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR CONSTRUCTION  AS THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE PRACTICAL USE OF THE INSTRUMNENTS IS GREATER THAN MIGHT BE SUPPOSED AND AS THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS ATTENDED TO BY EVERY ARTIST THE QUALITY OF THE MIIETAL OF WHICH THE FRAMING PART OF THE INSTRUMENT IS MADE IS NOT INDIFFERENT AS THE STABILITY OF THE INSTRUMENT DEPENDS IN SOME MEASURE UPON IT IF BRASS IS USED THIS IS SUBJECT TO VERY GREAT VARIATION WITHOUT BEING OB SERVED BY A PERSON NOT WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUBJECT THE MIXTURES OF COPPER AND TIN PROPERLY CANNON METAL THOUGLH USUALLY CALLED BELL MNETAL ARE MUCLH MNORE EASILY DIS TINGUISLHED IN QUALITY ANID TLHEREFORE PREFERABLE IN MIIANY IN STANICES THE USE OF THIS METAL FOR THE AXES WHLEN THE SOCK ETS ARE BRASS OR FOR THIE SOCKETS WHEN THE AXES ARE STEELOF THE UNITED STATES 379 MIUST BE CONSIDERED AS INDISPENSABLE FORMERLY THE ARTISTS IN ENGLAND HAD FOR THIS PURPOSE A STILL HETTER METALTHE TUTENAGUE IMPORTED FROM CHINIA BUT NOW PROHIBITED THE GREATER HARDNIESS OF THIS METAL WAS PARTICULARLY FAVOURABLE FOR THE AXES OF TRANSITS 5C WHICH BY THEIR FREQUENT REVOLUTION UPON THE SAME PARTS WITHOUT GOING COMPLETELY ROUND ARE VERY APT TO BECOMNE PARTIALLY WORN AND WHICH CANNIOT BE MADE OF STEEL ON ACCOUNT OF ITS RUSTING ALL THE NOBS AND SOCKETS IN WHICH THE TANGENT SCREWS MNOVE SHOULD BE OF GOOD CANNIONI METAL FOR THESE SCREWS BEING FREQUENTLY USED WILL SOONI LOSE THEIR EASY MOTION IF THEY TURN IN BRASS IN CONSE QUENCE OF THIEIR CLOSE CONTACT AND EQUALITY OF TEXTURE AND AFTER THIS THEY ACQUIRE AN INEFFICIENT OR LOST MOTION TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE OBSERVER TO AVOID THIS IN ALL CASES T THINK IT WOULD BE EASY TO ADAPT A SPIRAL SPRING OF STEEL WIRE AROUND THE SCREW BETWEEN THE TWO NOBS IN WHICH THE SCREW WORKS PRESSING IT ALWAVS TO THE SAME SIDE OF THE PATH IN THE GENERAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE INSTRURMENT ATTENTIONI MUST BE PAID TO GIVE TO THE LOWER PARTS SUCH STRENGTH AND WEIGLHT WITH RESPECT TO THE UPPER AS MNAY NOT ALLOW OF ANY SPRING THIS IS THE GREAT DIFFICULTY WHICH REQUIRES THE OBSER VERS PARTICULAR CARE IN THE REPEATING CIRCLE WITH TWO TELE SCOPES WHERE THE MAIN WEIGHT OF THE INSTRUMENT IS SUPPORT ED IN EQUILIBRIO UPON A SMALL AXIS SO THAT THE VERTICAL OBSER VATION MUST IN SOME MEASURE HE TNADE WITHOUT TOUCHING THE INSTRUMENT THE VERNIERS WHICH PRESENT INCLINED PLANES TO THE DIVISIONS MUIST TOUCH THEM IN ORDER TO SHOW ACCURATELY THIE COINCIDENCE AND AVOID PARALLAX THIS RENDERS IT NECESSARY TO GIVE SOME SPRING TO THE ARMS WHICH BEAR THENI AND CARE MTUST THEREFORE BE TAKEN THAT THEY DO NOT RUB THE DIVISIONS AND OF COURSE DO NOT DRAG MR REICHENBACH IN MUNICH AVOIDLS THIS BY DIVID ING THE VERNIERS UIPON A COMPLETE CIRCLE WHICLH PRESENTS IT SELF INSIDE TO THE LIVISIONS IN THE SAME PLANE BUT THIS RE QUIRES VERY NICE WORK AND AS THIE CIRCLE IS LIGT SOME CARE TO PREVENT ITS WVARPIRIG WHICH MAY BE OCCASIONED BY A RETURN OF SOME HAMMERED PARTS OF IT TO THEIR FOR MER IRREGULAR SHAPE380 SURVEY OF THE COAST THESE LIGHT PARTS ARE VERY LIABLE TO SPRING BACK ON BEING EXPOSED TO A CONSIDERABLE VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE BY THIS CONSTRUCTION MR REICHENBACH HAS APPLIED VERNIERS IN HIS CIRCLE OF THE PARIS OBSERVATORY OF WHICH THE DIAMETER IS ONE METRE AND WHICH IS THE LARGEST SIZE HE FINDS ADVISABLE TO GIVE TO ANY INSTRUMENT THE ENGLISH ARTISTS ON THE CONTRARY USE COMPOUND NMI CROSCOPES FOR THE READINGS WHERE THE DIAMETERS ARE ABOVE EIGHTEEN INCLHES ARID FIND THEM TO BE VERYCONVENIENT TRHESE NMICROSCOPES AND PROBABLY THE READINGS WITH THEM ARE MORE ACCUR ATE  BUT THEY REQUIRE MORE LABOUR AND VERY ACCURATE WORK I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THAT FOR A DIVISION BY POLNTS THE NMICROMETER MUST HAVE ONE SINGLE WIRE IN THE DIRECTIONI OF THE RADIUS AND FOR A DIVISION BY LINES TWO WIRES INTERSECT ING EACH OTHER AND INCLINED EQUALLY TO THE RADIUS MAKING ANGLES OF ABOUT FIFTEEN DEGREES ON EACLH SIDE OT THE DIVISION STROKE THE EQUALITY OF WHIICH IS VERY EASILY JUDGED WITH GREAT ACCURACY THLIE DIVIDED CIRCLE AS WELL AS THE RADII ARMS OR PLATES BEARING VERNIERS OR MICROSCOPES OUGHT NEVER TO BE ATTACHED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE INSTRUMENT EXCEPT THE CENTRAL PIECE IN ORDER TO BE IN ALL CASES EQUALLY FREE AND LEFT TO THEIR OWN SPRING AND SHAPE IN LIKE MANNER THE CENTRE PIECE IS TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE STAND PART ALONE THE CLAMPING AND TANGENT SCREW ARRANGEMENT OUGHT AL WAYS TO BE STRONG AND NEVER TO BE FIXED TO AN ARM BEARING A VERNIER OR A MICROSCOPE IT IS VERY APT TO AFFECT IT DIFFER ENTLY FROM THE OTHER VERNIERS AS IT HAS TO ACT ON ALL LARTS AS LEADER AND TO OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE OF THE CENTRAL FRICTION ON THIS ACCOUNT IT IS COMMONLY MADE SOMNEWLAT STRONGER THAN THE OTHERS IF THE VERNIERS ARE NOT ATTACHED TO A FULL PLATE IT WILL BE BEST TO GIVE THE INSTRUIMENT A SEPARATE STRONG ARM EXPRESSLY FOR THE PURPOSE AND TO MNAKE ALL ARMS OF VER NIERS OR MICROSCOPES EXACTLY EQUAL THIE QUALITY AND POWER OF THE TELESCOPES ON AN INSTRUMENT MUST ALWAYS EXCEED THE DETGREE OF ACCURACY WHICH IS OBTAINOP THE UNITED STATES 381 ABLE BY THE OTHER PARTS OF THE INSTRUMENT AS IT SERVES TO VE RIFY THIESE AND ALSO GIVES CERTAINTY TO THE OBSERVER BY THE ACCURACY OF THE POINTING I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND IN TERRESTRIAL AS WELL AS CELESTIAL OBSERVATIONS THE LARGEST POWER WHICH THE TELESCOPE COULD BEAR THE MIOST ADVANTAGEOUS FOR USE GREAT LIGHT IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL REQUISITE ITHE DISTINCTNESS OF THE IMAGE AND ITS SIZE ARE FAR PREFERABLE AS IN TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS THLEY HELP IN POINTING MIINUTELY AND IN CELESTIAL OBSERVATION THEY INCREASE THE QUANTITY OF VISIBLE OR APPARENT MOTIOIN THLIE SAME CONSIDERATIONS SHOW THAT THERE IS NO GAIN IN A DIS PROPORTIONATE APERTURE ACCURACY OF THE IMAGE IS LOST BY IT AS MNAY BE EASILY TRIED BY DIMINISHING THE APERTURES OF LARGE TELESCOPES BY COVERS OF DIFFERENT OPENINGS IN THE COURSE OF TNY GEODESICAL OPERATIONS I WAS OBLIGED ONILY TOWARDS WINTER TO LAY ASIDE THE GREATEST MAGNIFIER OF THE TWO FEET THEODOLITE OF SEVENTYSEVEN TIMES AND TAKE THE INEXT OF ABOUT FIFTY TIMES BUT SOON AFTER OBSERVATIONS AT SONME DISTANCE BECAMIIE ENTIRELY IMPR ACTICABLE SO AS TO GIVE TLHE DESIRED DEGREE OF ACCURACY TLHESE CIRCUMSTANCES RENDER IT PROPER TO CHOOSE THE DIA MNETERS OF INSTRUTNENTS SUCH AS TO ALLOW WITH PROPRIETY AND EASE THE APPLICATION OF SOME OT THE TELESCOPES WHICH ARE OB TAINED IN GREATER PERFECTION  AND IN THIS RESPECT IT IS PROPER TO MENTION LHERE SOME FACTS RELATING TO THIS SUBJECT THE TELESCOPE WHICH IS OBTAINED THE MOST PERFECT IN ITS KIND IS THAT OF THREE FEET AND A LALF FOCAL LENGTH AND ABOUT THREE INLCHES APERTURE FOR INSTRUMENTS THE APERTUIRE OF ABOUT TWO INCHIES AND A HALF IS PREFERRED BELOW THAT SIZE TLHE TELESCOPE OF THIRTY TO THIRTVTWO INCHES WITH THE SAME APERTURES IS OBTAINED IN GREAT PERFECTION THESE TWO REGU LATE THEREFORE THIE SIZE OF THE LARGEST MOVEABLE INSTRUMENTS AFTER THIS THE TELESCOPE OF TWENTYTWO INCHES WITLH ABOUT AN INCLH AND THREEQUARTERS APERTURE WHICH IS WELL SUITED FOR THE EIGHTEEN INCH CIRCLES IS VERY GOOD FOR ITS SIZE RHE SMALLER SIZES ARE NMADE IN GREAT NUMBERS ANDL OF VARIOUS QUALITIES WHERE ALMFOST NO DISTINCTION CAN BE MADE IN RESPECT TO SIZE EXCEPT VOL IT3 D382 SURVEY OF THE COAST WHAT CLHANCE INTRODUCES  LHOSE HOWEVER ABOUT THIRTEEN INCHFES LONG FOR SOME OF THE BETTER GEODESICAL INSTRUMNENTS AND SIX INCHES LONG FOR EFLECTING INSTRUMENTS ARE THE MOST CAREFULLY ATTENDED TO ABOVE THE THREE FEET AIND A HALF TELE SCOPE THOSE OF FIVE FEET FOCAL LENGTH AND THREE TO FOUR INCHES APER TURE ARE FREQUENTLY OBTAINED VERY GOOD  AND MR RULLY OPTICIAN IN ISLINGTON HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THEM THOSE OF SIX FEET FOCAL LENGTH ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IN GR EAT PERFECTION THEY HAVE THE SANME APERTURE AS THE FIVE FEET ONES AND MR DOLLOND HAS MADE SOME VERY GOOD TELESCOPES OF THIS SIZE THOUGH OF COURSE AFTER MANY TRIALS AND THE RE JECTION OF MANY GLASSES A GOOD TELESCOPE OF SEVEN FEET FOCAL LENGTLH AND GREATER WITH FOUR TO FIVE INCHES APERTURE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THIE RESULT OF A HAPPY CHANCE AND PROPORTIONALLY TO WLHAT IS EX PECTED OF SUCH TELESCOPES I LHEARD ONLY OF ABOUT THREE OR FOUR THAT HAD ACQTUIRED A WELL DESERVED FAME OF THESE THE LARGEST AND BEST IS THE TEN FEET TELESCOPE WITH SIX INCHES APERTURE MADE BY OLD MR DOLLOND FOR THE GREENWICH OB SERVATORY TO PROVE THE POSSIBILITY OF MNAKING AN ACLHROMATIC TELESCOPE EQUALLY AS GOOD AS THE TEN FEET REFLECTING TELESCOPE OF DR HERSCHEL IN THIS HE ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED BUIT ONLY IN ONE GLASS OUT OF A NUMBER MADE WITH THAT VIEW RTHIS TELE SCOPE HAS LATELY BEEN ADAPTED BY MR TROUGLITON TO A TRANSIT INSTRUMENT FOR THE OBSERVATORY THE SIZES INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN FIVE FEET AND TWENTYTWO INCHES ARE CONSIDERED AS GENERALLY SPEAKING NOT GOOD FOR INSTANCE THE FOUIR FEET FOCAL LENGTH IS NOT SUITABLE FOR SCIEN TIFIC PURPOSES THEY ARE THEREFORE GENERALLY MOUNTED FOR POCKET TELESCOPES OR SPYGLASSES IN THE LARGER TELESCOPES THE OPTICIAN IS NOT QUITE CERTAIN OF THE FOCAL LENGTH IN THE FORMATION OF HIS OBJECT GLASSES THIS MAY VARY WITHIN TWO INCHES THOUGH THE GLASSES COMIE OUT OF THE SAME FORNMS BUT SUCH A DIFFERENCE IS OF NO IMNPOR TANCE A HIGH POLISH TO THE OBJECT GLASSES IS NOT DESIRABLE IN IN STRUMENTS THE GLARING LIGHT WHICH IT OCCASIONS IS NOT AGREEOF THE UNITED STATES 3883 ABLE IN OBSERVING A WELL DEFINED IMAGE IN A MUILKISH WHITE LIGLT WILL BE FOUND MORE AGREEABLE THOTGH THE ARTISTS SAY THAT THEY CAN POLISH AN OBJECT GLASS AS MUCH AS THEV CHOOSE WITHOUT DETRIMENT TO THE SHAPE OF THE GLASS AND THEREFORE ACCURACY OF THE IMAGE I SHOULD PRETER FROM EXPERIENLCE THE GREATER CERTAINTY OF ACCURACY WITH LESS POLISH TRHE OBJECT GLASSES FREQUENTLY CONTAIN CRYSTALLISATIONS WLHICH INJURE THE BRIGHTNESS AND ACCURACY OF THE IMAGE THESE CRYSTALLISATIONIS BECOME VERY APPARENT IN THE FOLLOWING MODE OF TRIAL WHICHI I FOUND TO BE THE BEST FOR JUDGING OF THE ACCURACY OF THE IMAGE WHEN THE TELESCOPE IS ADJUSTED AND DIRECTED UPON A FIXED STAR THIE EYE PART IS DRAWN OUT WHICH WILL CAUSE THE MICROSCOPE WHICH THE EYE GLASSES FORM TO VIEV IN ITS FOCUS SUCCESSIVELY OTHER SECTIONS OF THE CONE OF LIGLHT OF THE OBJECT GLASS AND IN PROPORTION AS THE LIGHT WILL BE EQUALLY DIFFUSED UPON THE CIRCLE SO SEENI AND AS IT WILL BEAR TO BE NMORE DRAWN OUT WITHOUT BECOMING DIFFUSED THE TELESCOPE WILL BE MORE PERFECT AND MORE ACCURATELY ADJUSTED FEW TELESCOPES WILL STAND A VERY SCRUPULOUS TRIAL OF THIS KIND MOST GENERALLY THE LIGHT WILL BE MUCH STRONGER TO WARDCS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE THAN IN THE INTERIOR ANID IN THIS WVILL ALMOST ALWAYS BE FOUND SOME DARK SPOTS OF ANGULAR SHAPE PRESENTING THEMSELVES EXACTLY LIKE CRYSTALS UNDER A MICROSCOPE WLICH SHOW THE EFFECT OF THE CRYSTALS IN THE GLASS THROWING THE LIGHT FROM ITS REGULAR COURSE ANY STRAY LIGHT AS THE OPTICIANS CALL THE RAYS WHICH APPEAR AS IF DARTING OUT OF THE CIRCLE IS VERY APPARENT IN THIS TRIAL THE BEST TELESCOPES THEREFORE ARE THOSE WHICH DIRECTED UPON A SMNALL ANID NOT TWINKLING STAR AND PUT A LITTLE OUT OF FOCUS WILL PRESENT A SHLARPLY DEFINED IMAGE WITLH A DISK LIKE A PLA NET TRHE LARGER THIS IMAGE CAN BE MADE THE BETTER THE TE LESCOPE THLLE OPTICIANS MNEET WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY INFINDING GOOD GLASSES AND IN MAKINL LARGE OBJECT GLASSES MUCH MORE GLASS IS WVASTED THAN IS USED VARIOUS OTHER CIRCUIMSTANCES ALSO INCREASE THE PRICE OF THE LARGER GLASSES SO THAT A GOOD OBJECT384 SURVEY OF THE COAST GLASS OF A LONIG FOCUS ANID LARGE APERTURE LHAS CONMPLETELY A FANCY PRICE BUT IT WOULD BE TOO TEDIOUS FOR ME TO ENTER LERE INLTO DETAILS ON THIS SUBJECT IT NMAY BE PROPER FOR ME TO MENITION A SOURCE OF ERROR WLHICH MAY AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE SPIRIT LEVELS THESE MAY GENERALLY BE SUPPOSED TO BE ADJUSTED AT A MEAN TEMPE RATURE OF COURSE A MEAN LENGTH OF THE BUBBLE AT THE HIGHER AND LOWER TEMPERATURES IN WHICH IT IS OFTEN NECESSARY TO OB SERVE THE LONGER OR SHORTER BUBBLE MAY MEASURE DIFFERENTLY IN THE COURSE OF THE LEVEL IF THIS IS NOT VERY REGULAR BESIDES THAT ITS OSCILLATION WILL AT ALL TIMES BECOME SLUGGISLH AND MORE IRREGULAR TLHE MANNER OF PACKING THE INSTRUMENTS IS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THEIR ACCURACY THE BOXES OUGHT ALWAYS TO BE OF LIGHT AND STRAIGHT GRAINED WOOD NO PIECE MUST EVER BE FIXED IN A DIRECTION DIAGONAL TO THE GRAIN AS IT WILL BE PRESSED OUT OF SHAPE BY THE DRYING OF THE WOOD ANY PIECE FASTENED SEPARATELY MUST ALWAYS BE PLACED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LENGTH OF THE FIBRES IN TRAVELLING THE INSTRUMEENT SHOULD ALWAYS BE PLACED AS MNUCLH AS POSSIBLE IN THE SAME POSITION IN WHICH IT IS USED THOSE PARTS ONLY WHICH ARE NOT FIXED TO IT BEING TAKEN OFF AND PACKED SEPA RATELY THE CENTRE BEING

THEREFORE BE USEFUL TO GIVE LHERE SONLE PRACTICAL PRIN CIPLES ON THIS SUBJECT IN ORDER TO GUIDE THE OPERATOR IN TAKING PROPER ADVANTAGE OF THE TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCES ANID TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES WLICLL ARE ALWAYS TO BE MET WITH IN PRACTICAL WORKS THE APPLICATION OF THESE TO THE SURVEY OF THE COAST MAY SERVE AS ANL EXAMPLE WHICH AT THE SAME TIME WILL GIVE SUCH INFORMATION WITLH RESPECT TO THAT

PLACE FOR A LINE OF SUFFICIENT LENGTHL TO FORMI THE BASE OF THE TRIANGULATION IN SUCTH A SITUATION AS WILL ENABLE THE SURVEYOR TO ARRIVE BY SIMPLE OPERATIONS AND WVITH ACCURACY TO THE DETERMINATION OF A DISTANICE BETWEEN TWO ELEVATED POINTS IN A FAVOURABLE POSITION RELATIVE TO THIE SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS AND THE COUN TRY AT LARGE IF THESE POINTS BE AT THE SAME TIMTE THE HLIGHEST AND FREEST IN THE NEIGHBOUTRHOOD THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE386 SURVEY OF THE COAST CHANCES OF FORMING THE SUBSEQUENT TRIANGLES WILL NOT ONLY ACCELERATE THE WORK BY THE GREATER NUMBER OF POINTS WHICLH MAY BE DETERMINED FROM THEM BUT ALSO ENABLE THE OPERATOR TO CHOOSE THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS COMBINATION OF TRIANGLES AND IF THE SURVEY SHALL EXTEND OVER A WHOLE COUNTRY IT IS PROPER TO BEGIN IN SUCH PART OF IT AS WILL SOON LEAD TO THE LARGEST TRIANGLES POSSIBLE THIS WAS THE PRINCIPLE WHICH INDUCED ME TO BEGIN IN THE NEIGHBOURLHOOD OF NEW YORK AFTER I HAD RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MR DALLAS SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY AUTHORISING ME TO BEGIN WHEREVER I SHOULD THINK IT MOST ADVANTAGEOUS THE CONFIGURATION OF THE COUNTRY PARTICULARLY THE DIRECTION OF SOME PRINCIPAL CHAINS OF MOUNTAINS MAY GUIDE US IN THE RESEARCH FOR A BASE LINE BECAUSE IT IS GENERALLY PARALLEL WITL STRAIGHT RANGES OF MOUNTAINS THAT THE MORE LEVEL AND EXTEN SIVE PLAINS ARE FOUND AND THE FIRST TRIANGLE POINT WILL FALL UPON SOME ELEVATION IN AN OPPOSITE RANGE OF MOUNTAINS IF THESE BE NOT VERY ELEVATED IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO MAKE FIRST A PRELIMINARY RECON NOITRING SURVEY OF SUCH A TRACT OF THE COUNTRY AT LEAST AS IRAY BE LIKELY TO FURNIISH THE BASE AND A COMPLETE SYSTEMS OF TRI ANGLES ADMNITTING OF VERIFICATION THE MORE NMINUTELY THIS CAN BE DONE THE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS ON EVERY ACCOUNT WILL IT PROVE FOR THE ACTUAL SURVEY IN AN UNIFORM SIMNPLE TRIANGULATION IT IS MOST PROPER TO PLACE THE TWO BASE LINES WHICH ARE NECESSARY AT LEAST IN ALL SUCH WORKS NEAR THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF THE TRIANGUFLATION AND THEREFORE TO IMAKE ALSO AT THE BEGINNING THE NECESSARY RECONNOITRING FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT IN MY CASE IN THIS WORK IT WAS DESIRABLE TO OBTAIN IN AN EARLY STAGE OF THE WORK A VE RIFICATION OF THE LINEAR UNIT UPON WHIICLH THE TRIANGLE WAS FOUTNDED TO ALLOWV ME TO MAKE TISE OF IT FOR THE DETAIL STIR VEYS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BESIDES IN ALL CASES WHERE THE TRIANGUILATION IS TO SERVE FOR GEOGRAPHICAL PURPOSES IT MAY MOST GENERALLY BE EXLECTED THAT SEVERAL BASE LINES WILL BE NIEASUURED IN THE COURSE OF THE WORK RHIS FIRST RECONNOITRINIG REQUIRING THE MOST EXTENSIVE ANDOF THE UNITED STATES 387 FREE VIEW OF THE COUNTRY

THE ACTUAL TRIANGULATION SUCH WAS FOR INSTANCE MY CASE WITH THE BASE LINE ITSELF AND SEVERAL IMPORTANIT TRIANGLE POINTS THIS GEOMETRICAL VIEW OF A COUNTRY IS BY NO MEANS WITH OUT DIFFICULTIES AND REQUIRES GREAT ATTENTION AND A KIND OF GEOMETRIC EYE AS THE ACCURACY OF THE WORK DEPENDS FMUCH ONI THE FAVOURABLE SYSTEM OF TRIANGLES WHICH IS PROJECTED ON THESE DATA THE RMOST FAVOURABLE SEASON FOR THE ACTUAL TRIANGULATION IS DURING SPRING AND SUMMER WHEN THE IENGTH OF THIE MORNINGS AND EVENINGS WILL AFFORD THE LONGEST TIME OF FAVOURABLE ILLU MINATION FOR OBSERVING WHICH AT THE NOON ELEVATION OF THE SUN IS INADMISSIBLE IN THIS CLIMATE THIS TITNE IS OFTEN INTER RUPTED BY THE FREQUENT RAINS IN AUGUST IN THE FALL THE ATMOSPHERE OF LOW COTNTRIES PARTICULARLY THE SEA SLHORE BECOMES VERY UNTRANSPARENT AND THE TIME OF THE DAY FAVOURABLE FOR ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS SO LIMITED THAT IT CAN HARDLY EVER BE EXPECTED TO TAKE A FULL SERIES OF ANGLES CONISECUTIVELY FOR INSTANCE FROM MY STATION AT THE EAST END OF THE VERIFICATION BASE NEAR GRAVESEND IN DECEMBER 1817 THE LARGE LIGHTHOUSE OFF SANDY HOOK ONLY ABOUT NINE MILES DISTANT WAS NEVER VISIBLE A WHOLE HOUR IN THE MORN ING OR EVENING AND AS

EMPLOYED IN THE FINAL CALCULATIONS PROJECTING THE TRIANGLES UPON PAPER AND OTHER LABOURS RELV TIVE TO THE LAST SUMMERS OPERATIONS AND PREPARATORY TO THOSE FOR THE NEXT SUMMER THIS WILL OCCUPY MORE PERSONS THAN THE ACTUAL OBSERVATIONS LHAVE OCCUPIED IN SUNMMER AS IT IS PROPER THAT ALL ACTUAL CALCULATIONS BE MADE AT LEAST DOUBLE AND BY DIFFERENT PERSONS THE VERIFICATION COMPARISON AND COMLBINATION OF THIE RESULTS WILL TAKE UP MUCH TIME388 SURVEY OF THE COAST IN CHOOSING A STATION AND IN RECONNOITRING DUE ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO SELECT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS POINT OF THE NMOUNTAIN

DISTINCTLY VISIBLE BESIDES THIS THE GROUND UPON WHICH THE INSTRUMENT IS TO STAND MUST BE VERY SOLID UNLESS UPON ROCKS OR VERY DRY HILLS THE SOLIDITY WILL HARDLY EVER BE FOUND SUCH AS NOT TO AFFECT TLHE LEVEL OF THE INSTRUMENT BY WALKING NEAR IT OR BY THE DIFFERENT POSITION IN WHICH THE OBSERVER STANDS WITH RESPECT TO IT IN A SIMPLE TRIANGULATION WHERE ONLY FEW ANGLES ARE OB SERVED UPON THE SAME POINT IT MAY BE ALLOWED WITLHOUT MUCH INCONVENIENCE TO PLACE TTHE INSTRUMENT AT ANY POINT NEAR THLE ACTUAL SIGNAL WHICH MAY BE FAVOURABLE FOR THE OBSERVATIONS ANID TO REDUCE THE ANGLES TO THE SIGNAL OR STATION POINT BY THE ANGLE OF POSITION AND DISTANCE REQUIRED THUS WE MAY USE STEEPLES PARTS OF BUILDINGS OR SUCHL FIXED POINTS BUT NEVER TREES AS STATION POINTS THLIIS HIOWEVER MUST BE AVOIDED WHEN A GREAT NUMBER OF ANGLES REST UPON A POINT AND IT IS TO SERVE FOR DETAIL SURVEYS BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENT CALCULA TION OF THE REDUCTIONS IS ACTUALLY MORE TEDIOUS THAN THE CAL CULATIONS THEMSELVES AND BECAUSE IT WOULD BE VERY INCONVE NIENT TO KEEP ACCOUNT OF TWO SUCH NEAR POINTS ON THE PAPERS INTENDED FOR THE DETAIL SURVEYS IT MUST HOWEVER BE OBSERVED THAT IN GENERAL STEEPLES AND BUILDINGS ARE ALWAYS TO BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE ONI ACCOUNT OF THEIR NOT GIVIN ACCURATE SIGNALS RHEY SHOULD THEREFORE ONLY BE USED FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THEIR OWN POSITION AND NOT TO FORM POINTS IN A SERIES OF TRIANGLES IN ANY CASE OF SUCH A REDUCTION OCCURRING I USED TO CALCU LATE SEPARATELY ALL THE ANGLES SUBTENDED BY THE ECCENTRIC DIS TANCE AT EACHI OF THE SIGNALS UPON WHICLH ANGLES WERE OBSERV ED AND TO

WILL CERTAINLY BE THE CASE WITLH ALL MOVEABLE INSTRUMENTS PARTICULARLV IF THEY HIAVE UNDERGONE ANY LONG TRANSPORTATION OF ANY KIND HE MUST ADJUST THEM AND OBSERVE WITH THEM SOTNE TITNE NOT WITH THE

MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY EXISTS ONLY IN THE MNIND OF MAN ALL PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS ARE MNERE APPROXIMATIONS MORE OR LESS SUCCESSFUL AND WHEN ALL HAS BEEN DONE THAT SCIENICE AND ART CAN UNITE IN PRACTICE THE SUPPOSITION OF SOME DEFECTS IN THE INSTRUMNENTS WILL ALWAYS BE PRUDENT IT BE COMES THEREFORE THE DUTY OF AN OBSERVER TO COMBINE AND IN VENT UPON THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES METHODS OF SYSTENMATICAL OB

METHODS OF PROJECTING AND THE LIKE BESIDES THE GENERAL RESULTS WHICH WILL ALWAYS REMAIN EXAMPLES OF IT MAY BE SEEN IN THE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF MEASUREMENTS OF DEGREES T5C FOR THE ASSISTANTS IN THE CALCULATION IT WAS MY INTENTION IF THE WORK HAD PROCEEDED TO A GREATER EXTENIT TO HAVE HAD FOR MULAE OF BLANK CALCULATIONS LRINTED PURPOSELY WHICH IS A GREAT MEANS OF SECURITY AGAINST OMISSIONIS IN THE CALCULATIONS TO PROCEED IN SUCLI A WORK WITH THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE AND CELERITY IT IS PROPER THAT VARIOUS ASSISTANTS AND AN ADE QUATE NUTNBER OF LABOURING MEN BE WITH THE CHIEF OPERATOR THE NECESSARY DISCIPLINE AND REGULARITY WHICH THE NATURE OF THE WORK REQUIRES WOULD WHEN POSSIBLE GIVE FOR BOTH THE PREFERENCE TO MILITARY NMEN GOOD OLD SOLDIERS WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST FOR THE LABOURS THE WHOLE WORK MUST GO ON WITH THE GREATEST REGULARITY TO GIVE PROPER CONFIDENCE IN THE PRECISION OF IT AND THE DESIRED ACCURACY IN THE RESULTS THE BETTER THE ASSISTANTS ARE INFORNMED IN MATHLEMRATICS AND THE MORE THEY TAKE A PROPER CARE AND ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK THE MIIORE ADVANTAGEOUS WILL IT BE THEY MUST BE FUR NISHED WITH WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS UPON THEIR RESPECTIVE DUTIES AND IT WILL BE PROPER THAT THEY CHANGE DUTY IN REGULAR ROTA TION EITHER WEEKLY OR BY STATION THE SEPARATE JOURNALS WHICH THEY WILL HAVE TO KEEP ARE TO BE SIGNED BY THLEM AT THE END OF EVERY DAY TO FACILITATE A REFERENCE TO THEIR RECOLLEC TION IN CASE OF MISTAKE I FOUND THE FOLLOWING DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR WORK ADVANTA GEOUS ONE TO ACT AS SECRETARY TO THE OBSERVER HE IS TO WRITE THE NAMNES READINIGS ON THE INSTRUMENTS TC UNDER HIS DICTATION394T SURVEY OF THE COAST AND ALWAYS TO REPEAT THEM ALOUD WHEN HE LHAS WRITTEN THEMI TO PREVENT NISTAKES AND IF HE IS ATTENTIVE AND ACQUAINTED BY PRACTICE WITH THE PROPER SUCCESSION OF THE READINGS LHE CAN IN CASE OF MISTAKEN OR INMPROBABLE READINGS BY WARNING THE OBSERVER CAUSE THE CORRECTION OF ANY MISTAKE BY A RE PETITION OF THE READING BEFORE THE INSTRUMENT IS MOVED IN OBSER VATIONS REQUIRING THE NOTATION OF THE TIME HE WILL COUINT WITLH THE CHRONOMETER AND MARK THE MUOMENT WHEN THE WORD IS GIVEN TO HIM BY THE OBSERVER A SECOND WILL ACT AS AN ASSISTANT OBSERVER IN SUCH OBSER VATIONS AS REQUIRE IT OBSERVE REGULARLY AT STATED HOURS AND AT THE TIME OF EVERY OBSERVATION REQUIRING IT THE BAROMETER AND THERMOMETER OF WHICLH HE WILL KEEP A REGULAR JOURNAL RNAKE THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE MAGINETIC NEEDLE IN CASES WHERE IT IS OF INTEREST AS IN THE SURVEY OF A SEA COAST A THIRD ASSISTANT WILL FIND SUFFICIENT EMPLOYMENT IN PRELI IMIINIRY CALCULATIONS THE NMAKING OF A SECOND COPY OF THE DAY BOOK OCCASIONAL ATTENTION TO THE SIGNALS DIRECTING THE MEN IN CLEAR ING VIEWS AND VARIOUS SIMILAR OCCUPATIONS ONE OF THE ASSISTANTS SHOULD BE A DRAUGHTSMAN FOR VIEWS WHO SLHOULD DRAW ON EACLH STATION THE VIEW OF THE WHOLE HO RIZON MARKING THE POSITIONS OF ALL THE SIGNALS SO AS TO INDI CATE THEIR PLACE IF THEY SHOULD BE NIEEDED AT ANY FUTURE TIME THE FOREGROUND OF HIS DRAWING WILL ALSO AID IN FINDING THE STATION POINT ITSELF HE WILL ALSO MAKE DETAILED DRAWINGS OF THE SIGNALS AS THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES IN THE MAGNIFIED SCALE THROUGH THE LARGEST TELESCOPE WITH ALL THE OTHER OB JECTS ACCOMPANYING IT IN THE FIELD OF THE TELESCOPE THIS WILL DIRECT THE OBSERVER IN DISTINGUISLHING THE SIGNALS IN THE SMALLER TELESCOPES OF THE INSTRUMENTS FROML OTHER OLBJECTS WHICH IT MIGHT BE EASY TO MISTAKE FOR THEN THESE DRAWINGS WHICH WILL FORNM A PRETTY LARGE COLLECTION MAY ASSIST IN THE PROPER SHADITG OF THE ELEVATIONS IN THE DRAWING OF THE MAPS  AND THEY MAY SERVE IF CIRCUTNSTANCES SBOULD RNAKE IT DESIRABLE TO MNADE A MODEL IN RELIEF OF A PART OF THIE COUNTRY FOR WHICL MANY OF THE TNATHENMATICAL DATA ARE GIVEN IN THE SURVEY AS THE ELEVATION OF ALL THE SIGNALS OVEROF THE UNITED STATES 395 THE SEA WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE VERTICAL ANGLES OBSERVED AT THE STATIONS THESE ADDITIONS TO THE MNERE HORIZONTAL SURVEY WILL ADD MORE INTEREST AND USEFULNESS TO THE WORK THAN MIGHT BE EX PECTED NOT ONLY IN A SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW BUT ALSO FOR PUBLIC UTILITY JOINED TO AN ACCURATE AND MINUTE DETAIL SUR VEY EXECUTED UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH WILL BE EXPOSED HEREAFTER ALL THIE DATA SHOULD BE COLLECTED TO ENABLE THE GO VERNMENT TO JUDGE WITLH PROPRIETY OF THE PLAN OF ANY PUBLIC UNDERTAKING OR SERVICE SUCH AS ROADS CANALS INEANS OF DE FENCE OF THE COUNTRY EC THAT THE SURVEY OF THE COAST WAS TO CONTAIN ALL THESE DATA BESIDES THE MERE OUTLINES OF THE COAST AND THAT THEY WERE AS NECESSARY AS THE SOUNDINGS OUT SIDE OF THE LINE OF THE COAST APPEARED TO MNE TOO EVIDENT TO ADMIT OF ANY DOUBT AND I WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THE FULL AIM OF THE WORK MIISSED WITHOUT THEM ANOTHER ADDITION PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO NAVIGATION WAS TO OBTAIN A COMPLETE SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS OF THE VARIATION OF THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE OVER THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE COAST I INTENDED THAT THE MAGNETIC BEARINGS SHOULD BE OBSERVED AT ALL THE STATIONS EVERY DAY BY AN ASSISTANT THE NEEDLE BEING STATIONARY IN ONE POINT FOR THAT PURPOSE  BUT DURING THE SHORT TIME THAT I WORKED THE MULTIPLICITY OF MY OTHER OCCUPATIONS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HINDERED ME FIONM DOING MORE THAN JUST TO OBSERVE IT ONCE MYSELF AT THE CLOSE OF EACH STATION AN OSCILLATION NEEDLE WHICH I HAVE AND WLHICH HAS HEEN OBSERVED IN PARIS IN LONDON AND IN WASHINGTON WAS IN TENDED TO BE OBSERVED ALSO REGULARLY AT EACLH STATION THE UNION OF THESE TWO KINDS OF OBSERVATION WOULD HAVE GIVEN AN INTERESTING RESULT RELATIVE TO THIS SUBJECT IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY TO ENTER INTO THE REASONS WHICH DICTATED THE ESTABLISHNMENT OF ONE OR NMORE OBSERVATORIES CON NECTED WITH THE CHAIN OF TRIANGLES THEREBY TO BIND THE WORK TO ONE OR MORE PERMANENT POINTS ASTRONOMICALLY DETERMINED THE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT IS PERFECTLV EVIDEUIT THE FOLLOWING IS THIE MNOST PROPER ORDER OF THE OPERATIONS ON A FAVOURABLE DAY AT ANY STATION EVERY DAYS WORK MUST396 SIURVEI OF TILE COAST BE BROUGHT TO APPROACLH AS NEAR TO IT AS POSSIBLE IT WILL SLHOW THAT NO IDLENESS IS ADNMITTED AS THE OMISSION OR LOSS OF THE POINTS HERE MNENTIONED WOULD OCCASION ANI ENCROACHMLENT UPON THE NEXT DAY OR PERHAPS ITS RECOVERING BE LONG INMPED ED BY CIRCUMISTANCES I SUPPOSE THE OBSERVER TO BE FURNISH ED WITH AT LEAST ONE INSTRUMENIT FOR VERTICAL ANGLES AND ONE FOR HORIZONTAL ANGLES TIME PIECES A BAROMETER THERMOMETER SEXTANT AND ARTIFICIAL HORIZON THE OBSERVER MUST BE AT HIS INSTRUMENITS ONE HOUR BEFORE SUNRISE TO TEST THEIR SOLID STATNDING CLEAN THEM WITH A FEATHER FROM SANDY DUST WHICHI IS SO OFTEN INTRODUCED BY THE WINID INTO THE OPEN AXES AND UPON THE LIMBS 5C IF THEY NEED ATNY OIL IN THE OPENI AXES MNERELY PASSING OVER THE FINGER IS SUFFICIENT HE MNUST LEVEL THE INSTRUMENTS AND VERIFY ALL AD JUSTIMIENTS ADJUST THE COLLIMATION LINE AND THE FOCUS OF THE TELESCOPES AND THE READING MICROSCOPES TO CLEAR VISION AND COMPLETE FIEEDOTN FIOM PARALLAXES AND VERITF THE VALUE OF THEIR READIING FOR ALL THIS THE QUIET STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE COOLNESS OF THE MNORNING WITH THE FULL LICGHT WHICH PRECEDES THE RISINLG OF THE SUN FURNISH THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES HIS INSTRUMENT MNUST NECESSARILY BE IN GOOD ORDER AND NEED VERY LITTLE OF ALL THESE ADJUSTMENTS EC IT HE SHALL BE READY ABOUIT SUNRISE AS HE SHOULD AND THIS WILL BE THE CASE IF HE HAS DEVOTED THE PROPER ATTENTIONS AT THE BEGINI NING OF THE STATION TLHEN HE WILL LEVEL HIS INSTRUMENT FINALLY AND THE RISING OF THE SUN WILL THE PROPER NMOMENT TO OBSERVE THE ANGLES UPON THE SIGNALS WITHIN ABOTIT 40 ONI EACH SIDE OF THE SOUTHERN MERIDIAN UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE SUN IS ABOUT ITS DOUBLE DIA METER ABOVE THE HIORIZON IN CASE OF A SOUTHERN DECLINATION OR ONI THE SIX OCLOCK MERIDIAN WLEN IN A NORTHERN DECLINA TION  AT WHICH TIME IT IS PROPER TO TAKE ONE OR TWO AZIMUTHS OF THE SUN IN THE MAINER INDICATED AT THE PROPER PLACE ILHESE AZITMUTHS NMUST BE FOLLOWED IMMLEDIATELY BY OBSER VATIONS OF ZENITH DISTANCES OR ALTITUDES OF THE SUN FOR THE DE TERMNINATION OF THE TIMNE WHICB IT IS NECESSARY TO HIAVE AS FIEE FROM THE RATE OF THIE CHRONOMETER AS POSSIBLE AND WHICIHOF THE UNITED STATES 397 SHOULTD THEREFORE BE MADE DURING THE AZIMUTH OBSERVATION IT SELF IF ASSISTANTS FOR THAT PURPOSE ARE AT HAND AFTER THESE OBSERVATIONIS THE INSTRUMENT HAVING BEEN VERI FIED AGAIN THIE OBSERVATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL ANGLES WILL BE CON TINUEL UPON THE SIGNALS FROM THIE FORE MENTIONED SITTUATION TO ABOUT DUE NORTH UNITIL NEAR TEN OCLOCK IF THE ILLURNINATION OF THE DAY IS TAVOURABLE ABOUT TEN OCLOCK CORRESPONDINIG AL TITUDES MAY HE TAKEN WITH THE SUN FOR WHICTH THE EASIEST AND PROBABLY MOST ACCURATE METHOD WILL BE TO TAKE WITH A RE FLECTING INSTRUMENT THE CONTACT OF BOTH LIMBS OF THE STUN NO TING THE TIME AND LAYING THE INSTRUMLENT UNIDISTURBED AND CARE FULLY ASIDE TO OBSERVE THE SAME AGAIN AFTER NOON THIS WILL AVOID EVERV INFLUENCE OF ANY ERROR OF THE INSTRUMNENT DUR ING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPLHERE AND THE ILLUMINATION ARE SO UNFAVOURABLE TO THE OBSERVATION OF TERRESTRIAL ANGLES THAT NONE MUST BE OBSERVED THE OBJECTS BEING ALL SEEN IN THE SHADE AND THE REFLECTION FROM THE SIG NALS AND ANY OBJECT IN GENERAL PASSINIG HIGH OVER THE OBSER VER IN A HOT SUMMER DAY THE ILLUMINATION WILL EVEN CEASE TO BE FAVOURABLE AFTER 9 OCLOCK BUT WLHEN THE SUN HAS A LOW SOUTHERN DECLINATION IT MAY SOMETINMES BE POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE SOMEWHAT LONGER UPON SIGNALS NEARLY NORTH THIS IS THEREFORE THE TIME TO TRANSCRIBE THE OBSERVATIONS INTO THE DAY BOOK TO TAKE OUT THE RESULTS OF THE TERRESTRIAL ANGLES TO EXARNINE THEM MAKE SUCH PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS AS MAY BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE TIME AND RATE OF THE CHRONOMETER AND ARRANGE THE WORK OF THE AFTERNOON 4C ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE NOON IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ADJUST THE VERTICAL CIRCLE AND PREPARE FOR THE CIRCUMMNERIDIAN OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN FOR THOUGH IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY NE CESSARY IN A TRIANGULATION TO DETERMINE THE LATITUDE OF EVERY STATION BY ACTUAL OBSEIVATION STILL IT IS NOT PROPER TO LET THE SUN PASS THE MERIDIAN WITHOUT OBSERVING IT AS EVERY OBSERVA TION IS ALL ADDITION TO THE MASS OF THIS KIND OF OBSERVATIONS WHICHI IT IS NECESSARY TO LHAVE AS LARGE AS POSSIBLE AND THEY ARE ALL REDUCED TO ONE POINT BY THE GEODESICAL CALCULATIONS VOL TT 3 F398 SURVEY OF THE COAST WITHIN SUCH LINMITS AS WILL NOT ADMIT TOO GREAT AN INFLUENCE OF THE FIGURE OF THE EARTH UPON THE REDUCTION AFTER THIS OBSERVATION TIRNE TNAY BE ALLOWED FOR DINING ATTENITION BEING PAID HOWEVER NOT TO MNISS THE CORRESPONDING ALTITUDES OF THE AFTERNOON THE TIME OF WHICH MUST BE CALCU LATED APPROXIMATELY BEFORE HAND BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR OCLOCK THE FAVOURABLE TIME FOR THE OBSERVATION OF TERRESTRIAL ANGLES MAY BEGIN AGAIN SOMETIMES A LITTLE LATER SELDOM EARLIER THERE WILL BE LITTLE TIME TO LOSE AFTER THE CORRESPONDING ALTITUDES AND THE CALCULATION OF THEIR RESULT BEFORE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO COMMENCE THE LEVELLING OF THE THEODOLITE AND THE REVISION OF ALL ITS ADJUST MENTS THE ILLUMINATION WILL NOW BECOME FAVOURABLE FOR THE SIGM NALS IN SUCCESSION FROM DUE NORTH PAST THLE EAST TO ABOUT SOUTH OR SOMEWHAT FARTHER ACCORDING TO THE DECLINATION OF THE SUN AS THIS FORMS THE ELEMENT OF THE ANGLE OF REFLECTION FROM THE SIGNALS TO THE OBSERVER BY THIS IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT THE TIME FOR ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS UPON TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS BE COMES ALWAYS MORE LIMITED ON BOTH SIDES OF NOON AS THE DE CLINATION OF THE SUN BECOMES LOWER AND AN ATTENTION TO THIS SUBJECT WILL HAVE A GREAT INFLUENCE ON THE ACCURACY OF THE RE SULTS THE ORDER OF THE OBSERVATIONS IN TERRESTRIAL ANGLES AZI MUTHS SC IN THE AFTERNOON WILL BE EXACTLY THE REVERSE OF THAT OF THE MORNING EXCEPT THAT THOUGH IT WAS POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE WITH AND READ ON THE INSTRUTNENT IN THE NIORNING BEFORE SUNRISE THIS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE AFTER THE SUN IS SET THE TASK OF THE DAY IS STILL NOT OVER FOR IT IS NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE ALL THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE DAY BOOK TO TAKE OUT ALL THE RESULTS AND INTRODUCE THEM INTO THEIR PROPER PLACE IN THE JOURNAL OF RESULTS OR AT LEAST INTO A REGISTER OF THE RESULTS OF THE STATION TO EXAMINE AND COMNPARE THEM IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT DEGREE OF ACCURACY HAS BEEN OBTAINED HITHERTO AND WHAT IS YET NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE WORK OF THE STATION AND TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY FOR FUTURE OBSERVATIONS IT IS INECESSARY TOOF THE UNITED STATES 399 DO ALL THIS BEFORE ANY DERANGEMENT OF THE INSTRUMNIENT HAS TAKEN PLACE THAT ANY DISCREPANCY IN THE RESULTS MAY BE TESTED AND CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY THIS WILL MOST LIKELY NOT ALLOW AN EARLY REST TO THE OBSER VER THEREFORE IT WILL LHARDLY EVER BE POSSIBLE TO DO WHAT WOULD NOW BE ADVANTAGEOUS VIZ TO OBSERVE CIRCURNMERIDIAN ZENITTH DISTANCES OF STARS IN THE NIGHT PARTICULARLY TO THE NORTH TO COMPENSATE THE INFLUENCE OF THE INSTRUNMENT UPON THE OB SERVATIONS TAKEN TO THE SOUTH WITH THE SUN AND CORRECT THE RESULT BY THEIR MEANS THE OBSERVER WILL BE OBLIGED TO RE SERVE HIIS STRENGTH FOR THE WORK OF THE NEXT DAY AS HIS OB SERVATIONS WOULD LOSE MUCH OF THEIR ACCURACY IF LHE SHOULD BE OVERFATIGUED STICH NIGHT OBSERVATIONS ARE THEREFORE ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN HE HAS ASSISTANTS ABLE TO TAKE A PART OF THE TASK OF THE DAY FROM HIM NIGLHT OBSERVATIONS REQUIRE BESIDES A TEMPORARY OBSERVA TORY BUILT FOR THE PURPOSE AND APPROPRIATED TO THE INSTRUMENT USED LIKE ONE WLHICH I HIAD CONSTRUCTED FOR THE WORK OF THIE BOUUDARY LINE WITH CANADA IT IS PROPER TLHEREFORE THAT A PECULIAR AND SUITABLE STATION BE SELECTED TO MAKE A REGULAR AND WELL CONMBINED SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE LATITUDES WITH ALL THE NECESSARY MEANS AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR ACCURACY AS IT WILL THEN BE POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN MANY MORE OBSERVATIONS OF STARS THAN OF THE SUN THEIR NUMBER AND KIND MAY BE SO COMBINED AS TO SERVE AS A FULL COMPENSATION FOR ALL THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE SUN MNADE AT THE OTLHER STATIONS AND WHICH ARE TO BE REDUCED TO THIS BY CALCULATION IT WILL NATURALLY OCCUR THAT AT SUCH A STATION A COMPLETE SERIES OF AZIMUTHS MAY ALSO BE OBSERVED BY A VARIETY OF ME THODS AND WITH EVERY MEANS OF ACCURACY AND THAT AFTER SUCH A STATION HAS BEEN MNADE IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY TO OB SERVE THEM ON THE NEIGHBOURING STATIONS THE INDISPENSABLE OBSERVATIONS OF LONGITUDE ARE OF COURSE TO BE REFERRED TO THE PERMANENT OBSERVATORY OF THE COUNTRY IF SUCH A ONE EXISTS IF NOT THEY ALSO BECOME NECESSARY AT 2400 SURVEY OP TILE COAST SUCH STATIONLS MORE PARTICULARLY AS ARE MADE FOR THE SERIES OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF LATITUDE WITHOUT HOWEVER EXCLUDING THE OBSERVATIONS OF OCCULTATIONS OR ECLIPSES WHICLH MAY OCCUR ON ANY STATION AND WHICH IT WOULD NEVER BE PROPER TO OMIIT THOSE OBSERVATIONS ONLY DESERVE COTMPLETE RELIANCE IN ANY KIIID AND CASE WHATEVER WHIICH ARE MADE UNDER PROPER ARRANGEMENTS AND WITH EASE TO THE OBSERVER A STRONG GLARE OF LIGHT WHICH DAZZLES THE EYE AND AN INCONVENIENT POSITION OF THE BODY MUST ALWAYS PREVENT THE ACCURATE POINTING OF THE INSTRUMENIT AND READING OF THE ARCS THE EASE AND CON VENIENCE OF THE OBSERVER ARE THEREFORE NOT LUXURIES BUT ARE NECESSARY TO THE ACCURACY OF THE OBSERVATIONS THOUGH A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE WORK OF THE SURVEY OF THE COAST EXECUTED DURING THE YEAR 1817 IN WHICHI I WORKED AT IT WOULD NOT BE OF ANY GENERAL INTEREST AND COULD NOT IN FACT BE GIVEN AS MY PAPERS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO THE GO VERNMENT YELT I WILL PRESENT HERE BY WAY OF RECORD A SKETCH OF THE PRINCIPAL TRIANGLES EXECUTED EITHER FULLY OR PARTIALLY AND ADD A FEW NOTICES WHICH MAY GIVE AN IDEA OF THE AR RANGEMENT AND PLAN OF THE WORK AND OF THE ACCURACY OB TAINED IT IS EVIDENT THAT OF THE ACCURACY WHICH I AINMED AT NOTHING COULD BE ABATED IF THE WORK WERE TO BE SUCH AS OUGHT TO BE EXPECTED IN THE PRESENT IMPROVED STATE OF SCIENCE THE CHANCE OF AN ACCUMULATION OF ERRORS UPON SUCH A LONG EXTENT OF SEACOAST AS THAT OF THE UNITED STATES PARTICULARLY IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT LIES WVOULD HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF A WANT OF SYSTEM AND CARE WOULD HAVE BE COME TOO GLARING NOT TO BRING DISCREDIT AND SHAME UPON A LESS ACCURATE OPERATION THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORK WOULD HAVE GIVEN OCCASION TO MAKE A NUMBER OF DETERMINATIONS OF THE LENGTLH OF DEGREES OF LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE FROMN ITS EXTENT AND POSITION IT WOULD HAVE HAD PARTICULAR INTEREST AND NMIGHT HAVE SERVED AS THE FOUNDATION OF A SYSTEM OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES FOR THIS COUNTRY THE PRINCIPAL BASE LINE WAS OF SOMEWHAT MORE THAN NINEOF THE UNITED STATES 401 THOUSAND METRES AND BETWEEN CL AND VR PLATE IX THE FIRST TRIANGLES LIE UPON THE POINTS W AND CR IN THE FIRST ALL THREE ANGLES WERE MEASURED AND W FORMED OF COURSE THE MAIN POINT IN THE SECOND THE ANGLE AT CH COULD NOT BE MEASURED ON ACCOUNT OF A NEAR WOOD WHICH HID THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN UPON WHICIH CR WAS  WHILE A HIGHI SIGNAL IN CH WAS DISTINCTLY OBSERVABLE FROM CR FROM THE NEXT POINT BN ALL THE FOREGOING WERE OBSERVABLE AND VICE VERSA THIS GAVE OCCASION TO BRING UPON THE LINIE F AND BN THE RESULTS OF BOTH INTO COMPARISON WHERE FROM THREE TRIANGLES OF WHICH ALL THREE ANGLES WERE MEASURED AND THREE IN WHICH TWO HAD ONLV TWO ANGLES MEASURED THE TWO RESULTS WERETHROUGH W15508S8 METRES AND THROUGH CR1550886 METRES IN THE TRIANGLES THE SUM OF THIREE ANGLES WHICH I AM UN ABLE TO STATE FROM RECOLLECTION WAS SATISFACTORY I HAD NOT YET ALL THE ANGLES MEASURED IN THE COMPLETE SYSTEMATICAL ORDER WHICLH I EXPLAINED IN TREATING OF THE TWO FEET THEODOLITE BECAUSE THE GREAT DELAYS OF ALL KINDS WHICH I EXPERIENCED ON THE FIRST STATION ON WHICH I COMBINED TLHE METHOD FIRST HAD OCCASIONED INE TO LEAVE IT AND BE SATISFIED FOR THE TIME WITH THE NUMNBER OF ANGLES I HAD IN GENERAL TFHE TRIANGULATION BEING NOW CONTINUED THROUGH SP RN LS WE AND EE OF WHICH THE STATIONS RN AND LS COULD NOT BE OBSERVED FOR WANT OF TIME THE VERIFICATION BASE BE TWEEN WE AND FE WAS MEASURED AND COMPARED WITH THE RESULT BROUGHT FROMN THE FIRST BASE BY NINE TRIANGLES AND THE COINCIDENCE PROVED AS FOLLOWS FROM ALL THE POINTS NAMED THE DISTANCE FROM WE TO EE WAS 775281 MET WITHOUT USING THE TRIANGLE EE LS WE 83 EETNWE 96 BY ACTUAL MEASUREMENT 7753 THIS LAST NUMBER IN THE MEASUREMENT WAS MADE A ROUND NUMBER ON ACCOUNT OF A CHAIN MEASUREMNENT MADE PRELIMNI NARILY ONLY THOUGLH TWICE AND WITHIN LESS THAN HALF A METRE IN THE RESULTS BEING ALL THE ACCURACY THAT CAN BE EXPECTED BY THIS METHOD4Q2 SURVEY OF THE COAST THE BASE BETWEEN CH AND VR HAD ALSO BEEN MEASURED TWICE WITH THE CHAIN CAREFULLY AND IF I RECOLLECT RIGHT THERE WAS HARDLY THREETENTHS OF A MNETRE DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULTS AS THIS BASE WAS INTENDED FOR A STANDING ONE FOR THE WORK IN GENERAL THIE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF IT WAS SURAVEYED IN DETAIL PRE VIOUSLY IN ORDER TO LAY IT OUT IN THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS POSI TION FOR THE FUTURE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT WITH THE APPARATUS DESCRIBED IN ITS PLACE THE BASE BETWEEN WE AND EE BEING INTENDED AS HAS BEEN STATED ABOVE ONLY FOR AN EARLY VERIFICATION OF THE LINEAR UNIT OF THE WORK ILL ORDER TO BE ENABLED TO BEGIN THE DETAIL SURVEYS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT HAVE BEEN REMEASURED BUT ANOTHER ONE AT A GREATER DISTANCE FROM THE FIRST SUBSTITUTED FOR IT IN THE CONTINUATION OF THE TRIANTU LATION THE CHAIN WITH WHICH THEY WERE MEASURED WAS MADE PUR POSELY OF LINKS OF A METRE IN LENGTH WHICH AS THEY DO NOT BEND INTO ALL THE SMALL INEQUALITIES OF THE GROUND ARE FAR PRE FERABLE TO SMALL LINKS THE COINCIDENCE OF THE TWO BASES WAS UNDER THESE CIRCUM STANCES OF COURSE ABOVE EXPECTATION AND AS IT GAVE SUCH A PROOF OF THE ACCURACY OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE HAS BROUGHT IT FAR WITHIN THE LIMITS OF WHAT IT WOULD IN ANY SUITABLE SCALE BE POSSIBLE TO SHOW UPON PAPER IT WAS OF COURSE CONSIDERED SUF FICIENT TO SERVE TO GROUND THE DETAIL SURVEYS OF THE NEIGHBOUR HOOD ON THE TRIANGLES EXECUTED FROM THESE WHICH ARE SEEN IN THE SKETCH THE POINT H WAS INTENDED FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF THE SUR VEY TO THE EAST CONNECTED WITH W THE POINTS SP AND B WERE INTENDED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE TOWARDS THE SOUTH THE DISTANCE HF HAVING BEEN DETERMINED BOTH THROUGH W AND THROUGH CR HAD GIVEN A COINCIDENCE SUFFICIENTLY SA TISFACTORY FOR THE FEW ANGLES WHICH IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO MEASURE UPON H FROM CR AND W WHICH WOULD OF COURSE HAVE BEEN REPEATED IN THE FURTHER OPERATIONS AND CORRECTED BY THE OBSERVATIONS ON H ITSELFOF THE UNITED STATES 40O THROUGH W THE RESULT WAS4239203 METRES THROUGH CR THE RESULT WAS4239 164 THE OTHER COINCIDENCES BEINCG EQUAL TO THESE IN GENERAL IT APPEARED TO ME EVIDENT THAT IN APPLYING THE METHOD DE SCRIBED WHEN TREATING OF THE TWO FEET THEODOLITE IN THE ANGLES OF THE MAIN TRIANGLES I COULD REACH THE ACCURACY OF LESS THAN ONE SECOND IN THE SUM OF THE THREE ANGLES WITH FULL CERTAINTY ALWAYS AND THAT ONLY ONE PAIR OF DIRECT AND REVERSED OBSER VATIONS WAS FULLY SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE ANY NEAR DETAIL POINT THAT IT WAS THCREFORE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS TO OBSERVE THEM IN THIS IMANNER FROMN ANY STATION WHERE THEY WOULD BE VISIBLE AS THIS GAVE A VERIFICATION FROM DIFFERENT BASES THE AZIMUTHS OBSERVED GAVE RESULTS EQUALLY SATISFACTORY SO FAR AS THEY WERE CALCULATED BUT AS THEIR CALCULATION WAS NOT COMPLETED WHEN THE WORK WAS INTERRUPTED WHAT HAD BEEN DONE WAS AGAIN CAST AWAY AS IT DID NOT PRESENT A FINAL RESULT AND MIGHT BY BEING CONSIDERED AS SUCH RATHER MISLEAD THAN SERVE FOR ANY USEFUL PURPOSE THIS WAS SO MUCH THE MORE PROPER AS THEY WERE ALL TO BE CONSIDERED AS MERELY PRELIMINARY I HAD BUILT IN NEWARK IN MY GARDEN A SMALL OBSERVATORY WHICH COULD BE DETERMINED FRONM BN AND IN WHICH I INTEND ED TO MAKE A REGULAR SERIES OF LATITUDE LONGITUDE AND AZIMUTH OBSERVATIONS AS STATED ABOVE IT WILL EASILY BE OBSERVED IN THE SKETCH OF THE TRIANGLES WHICH ARE THE STATIONS ON WHICHI I OBSERVED ANY ANGLE THE LINES OF THE TRIANGLES BEING THERE DRAWN FULL WHILE TO THE POINTS ON WHICH I HAD NOT OBSERVED THEY ARE NMERELY DOTTED THE ANGLES OF ELEVATION OF THE PRINCIPAL POINTS WERE TAKEN ON ALL STATIONS SO THAT THEIR RELATIVE HEIGHT CAN BE CALCULATED TO REDUCE IT TO THE LEVEL OF THE SEA I LEVELLED ACTUALLY FROM THE POINT N DOWN TO THE WATER THIS POINT BEING CLOSE TO THE SHORE IN THE NARROWS UPON THE HIGH EASTER N BANK THE RESULTS OF ALL THAT RELATES TO THIS LHAVE NOT BEEN CALCU LATED AS THIS COULD ONLY TAKE PLACE AFTER THE CALCUTLATION OF THE DISTANCES THE GEODESICAL PARTS WERE OF MORE IMPORTANCE TO OBTAIN FIRST AS THEY LAY NEARER TO IMMEDIATE USE404 SURVEY OF THE COAST LATITUDES WERE OBSERVED ON VARIOUS STATIONS FOR TEMPORARY USE IN THE DETERNMINATION OF TIME 5C THE LONGITUDE WAS TAKEN FRORN THE GENIERAL ACCEPTATION OF THE LONGITUDE OF NEW YORK  BUIT ALL THIS TO DETERMINE ACCURATELY WAS OF COURSE RE

DIVIDERS AND IN THIS MANNER EVERY POINT WAS LAID OFF BY RECTATIGULAR ORDINATES FROM THE NEAREST SIDES OF THE TRAPEZIUMN OF THE PRO JECTION THE ACCURACY OF THE PROJECTION IS THEREFORE THE BASIS UPON WHICH THE ACCURACY OF THIE WHIOLE WORK DEPENDS ATID TO THIS GREAT ATTENTION IS TO BE PAID IT WILL ON EVERY STHEET BEGIN BY A RIGHT ANMRIE IN THE NMIDDLE EXTENDING OVER THE WHIOLE PA PER BOTH IN LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND TO OBTAIN THIS WITH ACCURACY AS WELL AS IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION IT IS NECESSARY TO ASSIST THE EVE WITH A MAGNIFVING GLASS TO AUG MENT THE SHARP VISION OF THE SMALL POINTS WHICH IT IS ONLY AL LOWED TO MAKE IF THE SINKING OF THE BEAM COMPASS SHALL NOT INTRODUCE ERRORS IN THE WORK IT IS NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY COMPASSES BUIT THOSE WITH REC TANGULAR POINTS FOR THE SMALLER PARTS THE PROPORTIONAL BEANM COMPASSES NO 46 OF THE CATALOGUE OF INSTRUMENTS WERE INTENDED RLHEY ARE VERY CONVENIENT IN THE HAND AND EASY TO SUPPORT AGAINST MAKING TOO DEEP POINTS TRO PREVENT THE BEAM COMPASSES FROM MAKING DEEP IMPRESSIONS AND TO EASE THEIR GUIDANCE I USED TO SUSPEND THEM OVER THE TABLE BY A ROLLER WITH A COUNTERPOISE IT IS EVIDENT THAT IN NO CASE WHATEVER A METHOD OF LAYING OFF A POINT BY MEANS OF AN ANGLE ANY HOW CONSTRUCTED CAN BE APPLIED IN THESE WORKS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THESE ARE ADNMISSIBLE IS IN THE PLANE TABLE OPERATIONS AND IN LAVING OM POINTS OF SOUNDINGS WITH THE STATION POINTER OBSERVED BY THE PROLLEM OF THREE POINTS TRHE PROJECTION WHICH 1 INTENDED TO USE WAS THE DEVELOP MENT OF A PART OF THE EARTHS SURFACE UPON A CONE EITHER A TANGENIT TO A CERTAIN LATITUDE OR CUTTING TWO GIVEN PARALLELS AND TWO VT ERIDIANS EQUIDISTANT FROM THE MNIDLDLE MERIDIAN AND EXTENDED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MERIDIAN AND IN LATITUDE ONLY SO FAR AS TO ADMIT NO DEVIATION FROM THE REAL NMAGNITUDES SENSIBLE IN THE DETAIL SURVEYS I HAD JUST COMNMENCED SOME CALCULATIONIS RELATIVE TO THE QUESTIONWHICH RADIUS OF THE EARTH WAS MOST ADVANITAGEOUS TO ADMIT THE GREATEST EXTENT TOOF THE UNITED STATBS 407 THE PROJECTION UNDER THE ABOVE CONDITION WHETHER THE GEO CENTRIC RADIUS OF THE LATITUDE THE RADIUS OF CURVATURE OF THE MERIDIAN AT THE TANGENT POIRIT OR THE RADIUS OF THE SPHERE TAN GENT TO THE SPHEROID AT THE POINT FURTHER THAN THIS I HAD NOT PROCEEDED WHEN I ABANDONED THE SUBJECT BY THE INTER RUPTION OF MY WORK IT IS AT ALL EVENTS NECESSARY THAT THESE PROJECTIONS GO OFF FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF LATITUDE AND BE ALL OF EQUAL EXTENT FROM THE CENTRAL MERIDIAN AND PARALLEL IN ORDER THAT THE DE VIATIONS FROM THE REAL NMAGNITUDE NMAY NEVER BECORME SO GREAT AS TO REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF CORRECTION FOR THE PLANE TABLE OPERATIONS WHICH DETERMINE OF COURSE THE DETAILS IN THE NEIGLHBOURHOOD OF ANY POINT OF A TRIANGLE FROM THE POSI TION OF THESE POINTS AS LAID DOWN BY THE PROJECTIONAND THAT IN BRINGING THE DIFFERENT PARTS TOGETHER THEIR POINTS ON THE EDGES MAY MEET AGAIN COMPLETELY BEING EQUALLY AFFECTED BY THE PROJECTION IN EACHI OF THESE SHEETS IT WAS INTENDED TO BRING THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL PARALLELS SO THAT TLLE CENTRAL MERIDIAN ALONE SHOULD BECOME A STRAIGHT LINE AND ALL THE OTHER MERIDIANS AND PA RALLELS BROKEN LINES NIEAREST THE CURVE TO WHICH THEY BELONG THE ANGULAR POINTS OF THE TRAPEZIUM BEING TRANSFERRED TO PA PER BY THEIR RECTANGULAR ORDINATES FROM THE MIDDLE RIGHT ANGLE CALCULATED FROM THE ANGLE AT THE CENTRE OF THE PROJEC TION IN THE PROTRACTED AXIS OF THE EARTH THE PAPERS TO BE GIVEN TO THE DETAIL SURVEYORS SHOULD BE DIVIDED DIFFERENTLY VIZ THEY MUST ALWAYS CONTAIN THOSE POINTS AND EXTEND OVER SUCH PARTS AS NMAY BY THE NATTURE AND CONFIGURATION OF THE COUNTRY BE BEST ADAPTED TO BE SURVEYED TOGETHER BUT THE POINTS RNUST BE LAID DOWN UPON THEM AC CORDING TO THE PLACE WHICH THEV WOULD OCCUPY IN THE ABOVE REGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROJECTIONS THIS DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROJECTION IN AN ASSEMBLAGE OF SECTIONS OF SURFACES OF SUCCESSIVE CONES TANGENTS TO OR CUTT ING A REGULAR SUCCESSION OF LARALLELS AND

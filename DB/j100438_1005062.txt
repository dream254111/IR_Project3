connected with the Survey of the Coast of the United States By F R HasslerCommw nicated 3d March 1820 CIRCULAR LETTER Treasury Department 25th March 1807 SIR The President of the United States being authorised by an Act of the last Session to cause the whole of the coast of the said States together with the adjacent shoals and soundings to be surveyed it is his intention that the work should be executed with as much correctness as can be ob tained within a reasonable time and he has directed me to apply to you requesting that you would have the goodness to suggest the outlines of such a plan as may in your opinion unite correctness and practicability As each nautical survey of the shoals and soundings pre supposes a knowledge of the position of certain points of the coast it seems to me that the work should consist of three distinct parts viz t The ascertainment by a series of astronomical obser vations of the true position of a few remarkable points onSURVEY OF THE COAST OP THE UNITED STATES 233 the coast  and some of the light houses placed on the princi pal capes or at the entrance of the principal harbours ap pear to be the most eligible places for that purpose as being objects particularly interesting to navigators visible at a great distance and generally erected on spots on which simi lar buildings will be continued so long as navigation exists 2 A trigonometrical survey of the coast between those points of which the position shall have been astronomically ascertained in the execution of which survey the losition of every distinguishable permanlent object should be care fully designated and temporary beacons be erected at pro per distances on those parts of the coast on whichi such ob jects are rarely fouind 3 A nautical survey of the slhoals and soundings of the coast of wlhich the trigonometrical survey of the coast itself and the ascertained position of the light houses and other dis tinguishable objects would be the bases anid which would thierefore depend but little on any astronomical observations made on board the vessels employed on that part of the work But this is submitted to your consideration not for the purpose of pointing out any plan in preference to another but only in order to shew the view which we have taken of the subject and the degree of accuracy which we are desi rous of obtaining I will onlv add that the greatest practical difficulties which have heretofore occurred relate to what I call the nautical survey and on that part of the subject the following inqui ries have arisenCan a correct survey be taken with one vessel alone Can angles be taken with sufficient correct ness from on board a vessel so as to ascertain its position in relation to three visible objects on shore Or is it neces sary that the vessels positiont at the time of taking any par ticular sounding should be ascertained bv observers on shore And many others which an examination of the sub ject will naturally suggest to you234 SURVEY OP THE COAST Permit me also to ask whether you know any person whom you might recommend as capable of acting in the dif ferent parts of the work I have the honour to be Respectfully Your obedient servant Signed ALBERT GALLATIN Mr Hassler Philadelphia Phliladelphie 2 JIvril 1807 MONSIEUR Honore de votre lettre du 25 Mars passe je prends la liberte de repondre a la confiance que vous

Plan for puctting inlto operation the Sutrvey of the Coast oJ the United States In my general plan of operation for the survey I men tioned that the establishment of two observatories would be necessary and I thiouglht it proper to procure the instru mlents destined for them of suchi a quality and size as to be suitable for a permanent national itistitution For this purpose it would now be necessary to add only a mural circle and a zenith sector which however desirable I did not venture to order as their absolute necessity in con nexion with the survey of the coast was Inot so obvious as that of the instruments procured These observatories form the fixed points to which the survey and particularly the naval part of it is referred The selection of proper places the erection of thie buildings and the setting up of the instruments will require some timne It would therefore be desirable to begin with this part of the weneral observation as soon as possible As they will be per manent scientific establishments it will be proper to decide whether the expense of their erection shall be conmprehended under those of thie survey or be considered as separate It will also be necessary to decide where they shall be erected To procure the greatest advantage for the survey their positions shiould be as far northeast and southwest as the very favourable position of the United States admits The same location affords also the greatest scientific advan tages Suipposing one in the District of Maine and the other it Lower Louisiana nearly every celestial phenomenon ob servalble from the tropic to the arctic circle and within albout two liundred degrees of difference of longitude could be observed at one or othier of them Trhe comparison of their distance and position as determinied astronomically and geodesically would offer the most rigorous proof of the sur242 SURVEY OF THE COAST vey Tlshe observations made in them could be cormpared with each other so as to render themii independent of fo reign observatories Still various considerations might oc casion and favour the desire of placing one of these obser vatories in the city of Washington as observatories are placed in the principal capitals of Europe as a national object a scientific ornament and a meauis of nourishing an interest for science in general This observatory would then be the most proper place of deposit for the standards of weights and mleasures which make part of the collection of instrumnents The observatory will require a constant observer the duties of whom are evident from tlhe nature of the instru ments and the object of the establishment viz to make ob servations of every plhenomenon leading to the deterinina tion of timne and longitude When the position of suchi an observatory shall be determined I will have the honour of submitting a plan of construction adapted to the object and the locality The wooden stands for the instruments the boxes for the bars to measure the base lines and the tin cases to make the pyrometrical experiments with being objects of bulk and inconvenient transportation I preferred having themn made in this country rheir construction is necessary to fit the instruments for actual use As soon as this is done I should proceed to standard the bars for measiuring the bases and to make the pyrometric experiments upon them It would be very desirable that I should be authorised to make an expenditure of about eight hundred dollars for these objects as well as for signal spheres and lamps for night signals whiclh I found it also better to hlave made in this country All these preliminary objects could be attended to this winter so as to enable me to begin next spring the first part of the survey itself viz the reconnoitering of a part of the coast in order to project a part of the triangles best suitOF THE UNITED STATES 243 ed for accuracy as well as approaching nearest to the figure of the coast and to find a proper place for a base line to ground thenm upon In this operation I should wish to be accompanied by a man acquainted with the part of the country I shall hlave to go through and to be allowed an expenditure for the trans portation of the snmall instruments the erection of temporary signals c Thius prepared it would be possible to make the actujal ineasurement of one base line in the latter part of the sum mner or in the fall of the present year During this timse the building of at least one of the observatories should be com pleted rhe instruments destined for it could then be put up during the winter and the adjustment of those intended for the survey itself could be mnade with the necessary at tention anid minuteness The work of the principal survey will be to form a chain of triangles with sides of about thirtv miles in length along the whole extent of the coast so as to join the distant parts by the shortest and most accurate lines possible and to de termine the azimuths of the sides of the triangles and the latituides and longitudes of their angular points Within these a series of triangles with sides of about ten miles will be formed to join them part of which it will some times be possible to carry on simultaneously with the large ones The object of these will be to furnish an ample num beir of determined points to which the survey may be re ferred in all its details It will be necessary to furnish the chief operator with the following assistance 1 Two officers of the corps of engineers well infortned in mathematics and with so much knowledge of the practi cal operations as will enable them to make the secondary observations and to keep the journal of them correctly 2 Twelve men of the corps of engineers most of theni artificers with a sergeant and corporal244 SURVEY OF THE COAST 3 One baggage wagon with the necessary horses and a driver 4 Trents and other field utensils suifficient to accommo date the persons employed and to shelter the instruments It will be necessary to construct the tents for the instruments particularly for the purpose 5 It would be convenient and in many cases importanit that a few cadets should be added who by following the work would prepare themselves to take the station of the officers when they would be emploved in operating by them selves as will be mentioned hereafter The duty of one of the officers will beto act as assis tant observer captain of the mnen employed and purser for all expenditures relating to the transportation of instru ments the construction and erectioni of signals and other similar objects For this purpose it will be necessary to make a yearly appropriation of about two thousand lollars of which he will have to keep an account I suppose that the support of men and horses will be comlprehended under the military expenditures The duty of the second officer will bethat of a lieute nant of the soldiers and of secretary to the observers This last office is necessary for the observations Without it it would be often impossible to execute themn within the abso lutely necessary limit of time The wagon will serve to transport the baggage provi sions tents signals tools and such of the instruments as will bear this mode of transportation The employment of the men will beto carry the prin cipal instrumnents from station to station to erect signals to prepare the stations for observation clearing the ways and various similar works which will occur constanitly in the course of the survey This mode of proceedinig will make the actual expenses of the survey the smallest possible as the requisite aid may easily be obtained from the arnmy without interruptinEg itsOF THE UNITED STATES 245 service It will have the advantage of preparing officers in an essential part of their emplovment and of giving them a knowledge of the localities of the country by which they nay become particularly useful in future The survey cannot be carried into its details until such a portion of the above work shall be executed and actually calculated as will serve to occupy two or three detail sur veyors in a certain district The same is to be observed with respect to the nautical survey which is to extend fromn the coast as far as any ob ject important to navigation may occur It will be most pro per to use in these parts of the work well informed officers lbrought up at the military academy and naval officers It was thie initention of Mr Gallatin to divide the whole work into two parts If that should be the wish now two corps of surveyors as described above would be required As the general chain of great triangles nmust however fornm one single system it mlay be found proper not to make this division until a part of these are done and when the secondarv triangles being more numerous will require an increase of the number of observers Such distributions of the work may be advantageously made as the principal work is proceeding when it nmiglht be divided into such a numnber as the localities would indi cate Thus for instance the coast of Louisiana being by its geographical position separated from the other parts of the coast of the United States would of itself form such a subdivision Robert Patterson Esq Director of the Mint in Philadel phia has from the heginning been appointed general su perintendant of this work In him tlle correspondence anid general communications relative to it have been miade to centre This part of the arrangetnent is therefore considlered as fixed independently of the present plan which is intenled merely to comprehend thie ways and means for putting the survey itself into operation vOL IIK 2246 SURVEY OF THE COAST According to the directions of Mr Gallatin the collection of instruments is miiade sufficient to furnish temporarily the necessary instruments for a leteriniiation of boundary lines If therefore any such work is now in contemplation the instrumnents for it muay be suipplied from the collection F R HASSLER Washington 5th January 1816 On the 15th of May 1816 a communication was made to the government on the measures necessary to be then taken in order to put into immediate operation such por tions of the work as could be undtertaken during that sea son As this comnmunication did not differ in any essential particular fionm the above it has not been thought neces sary to insert it here A

which duplicates were provided Comparison of the French and Enlglish Standard Measuires of Length and Regulation of the Bars for the Base Line Apparatus The necessity of having a standard measure of length as accurate and as authenitic as possible for the measurement of the base lines is sufficiently evident to slhew the propri ety of all the care which was taken to attain thiis object The two nmeasures of length whichi have been the most scientifically ascertained and compared are the French and English They are essentially different in their principle and ofOF THE UNITED STATES 251 different metals wlhiclh circumstance has always presented difficulties in their comparison The English standard is a brass scale divided into inches and tenths of inclhes Upon this the mean of all the possi ble measurements of any distance is considered as the pro per standard value of that distance the yard and the foot measured in this nmanner beitng equially legal standards though probably the yard was origitnally intended as such The different scales are of different ages and accuracY hiav ing been successively inmproved by various artists by mak ing scales fiom the mean lengths of various distances taken according to convenience upon the scale from wlhich the new standard was copied Upon this subject Sir George Slhuckburgh Evelins Account of the Cotparison of Mea sures may be consultedPhilosophical Trranisactions of Lon don 1798 The Freinch standard consists in a certain determined unit of length in iron giveni by a bar cut off to the given length either a toise as formerly or as at present a nmetre the iron toises of Peru being the only authetitic original to which all toises are referred and the metres of the Conmnmit tee of Weighlts and Measures the authentic originals of the nmetres Of their ratio and the mutual comparison of their measures the  Base du Syst8Ame Metrique gives a suffl cient account Trhe standlard temperature of the English scale is 620 of Falhrenheits thermometer that of the Frenich moetre 320 of the samse scale and the metre lhaving been compared witlh the toise at this temperature it haas also been adopted for the toise wlhich was formserly referred to 160 of Reau niurs scale He wlho has ever attempted to copy any absolute mea sured length with the accuracv necessary to form a standard mnust have soon liscovered whiat great minuteness anid care in the choice of means are requir ed for this purpose Beam compasses and simiiilar nmeans will soon he foutnd in admissible The successive transfer of a mneasure from a252 SURVEY OF THE COAST scale is far less satisfactory than the suiecessive mechanical addition of a number of copies nmade fiom a standard unit and compared to the same or any other by proper means This conviction derived from experience and a careful com parison of the modes of proceeding used in the late works of this nature in Europe decided mne to adopt for the unit neasure of the bars intenided for the base the comnbination of four iron bars each of two metres in length I lhad one nmore decisive reason for this choice viz that I had at my disposition one of the metres standarded by the Comimittee of Weights and Measures in Paris in t799 which being of the same authenticity in all respects with any of these measures in the possession of the respective govern ments and withi the platina metre of Paris places the ac curacy of my unit measure beyond all possible doubt The comparison made between the different standards this being anong the number reduces any multiple length of my de terminations to any standard desired by an easy numerical calculation This comparison of the different standards and the stand arding of the bars for the base line I executed in the months of February and March 18 t7 but I intended to repeat all the comparisons again before the measurementof the first base line with the bars I had likewise intended to compare the standard nmetrical and troy weiglhts of whiclh I had a full and authenitic collection by the fine balances placed in the col lection for that purpose and by another founded on hvdro static priinciples invented by my friend and teaclher M Tralles All these it was not possible for me to effect I will however here record what I have been able to do in this respect I will first give an account of the particular standards which I have compared and of their origin so that a judg ment may be formed of their authenticity I shall also state the means employed in their comparison and for the stand ardinig of my barsto shew the degree of reliance which may be placed in my resultsOF THE UNITED STATES Trhe standards were the following 1 An iron metre standarded at Paris in 1799 by the Committee of Weights and Measures conmposed of members of the National Institute and of deputies from other coun tries Its breadtlh is 113 inclhes its thickness 036 inches English measure My friend Mr J G Tralles now memn ber of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin was at that tinme thle deputy of the Helvetic Republic for this purpose and as nmay be seen in the account of the operations of this Com mnittee he was the foreigni memlber directing the construction and comparison of the measures of length He had one metre constructed for himself and one for me at the samne time with all the others and subjected in all respects to the same processes and comparisons In the ultinmate distribuition it is known that they were taken indiscriminately and consi dered equally autlhentic tflis metre being one takeni by M rTIalles He was so kind as to give nme at the same time a standard kilogramme constructed in the same maniner under the direction of Mr Van Swinden These original stanidards both of lenigthi measure and weighit

authentic of the kind in private hands About the tinme stated for the standarding of this toise the Academy of Sci ences of Paris discussed the prolriety of establishing as a natural standard the double lengtlh of the pendulumt under the equator M Du S6jour being then a member of that Aca denmy and interested in the subject from his situation this toise probably had reference to their views

two cormpound microscopes sliding on a rule and placed pa rallel to the scale of the same breadth and thiickness One of the microscopes has two fixed wires crossinig under 300 the other a micrometer with similar wires pointing out dis tinctly the ten thousandth part of an inch This apparatus lhas been described in Niclholsons Joturnal and other works A proper apparatus with a Hindleys tracing tool was add ed to which the mici onmeter microscope is adapted for the purpose of constructingf otlher scales from tlhis The scale was divided with that extreme care and accuracy for whch Mr rroughton is so justly praised It contains the double length of the principal part of his scale of which an accouint has been given in Sir George Shltickburgh Evelyns paper referred to above Mr Troughton first compared the02d 5 6 SURVEY OF lHE CONST different portions with one another for wlhichi comiparisoni and the subsequLent division he haEd constructed a proper appa ratus He thus fornmed a table of errors for his scale in the mnanner described in his method of dividing Phil Trans of 1809 and then laid off the new scale correcting each point according to the indication of the table The French standards were all compared Nwith this scale of Mr Trouglhton by means of the apparatus described and by methiods which will be mentiorned hereafter My particular nmethod of standarding the double metre bars required another apparatus which I had constructed for thie purpose It may be said to be impossible to cult a bar perpendicu larly to its length by lhand with the accuracy required Trhje tool in question is intended for this purpose Trhe following are its principal parts A plate of cast iron about eight inclhes broad and two feet and a half long exactly even and smooth is adjusted by screws from below upon a strong iron frame at one end of which two pieces direct in a perpendicular slide the socket piece which receives the axis of a circular file of about three inches in diameter to whiclh the above plate is adjusted so as to make the bar laid upon this plate and presented to the file exactly perpendicular to it A strong iron bar is made to slide over the whole length of the plate by means of two horizontal screws The bar to be filed being laid upon the plate and against this bar a trial of filing in two inverted positions will show any defect of adjustment doui ble The adjustment must be made accordingly and the surface of the cut will be perfectly even There is a change of files of different fineness and for the last a turkey stone whichi will take off all the marks of the file and grind the surface smooth When only one bar is to be standarded this tool nmust be used throughout with its different files and the turkey stone last But as I had foux equal bars to standard at once and could make the planes of their ends more perfect in conseO4 THE UNITED STATES 257 quence of the great surface they presented when joined to gether I proceeded somewhat differently for the last finishiing rThe bars were guaged as nearly as the workman in Lon don could do it to the breadth and thickness of the metres of the Committee and made seven feet four inches long The dduble metre being only about six feet seven inches there were nine incthes to be cut off which allowed me to make choice of the best parts of the bars for the cuts and to avoid the parts near the ends which are never equally well guaged because the tools which they are worked with lose there thieir steady support and fall off The pieces so cut oft were besides wanted for making the butting pieces for these bars and the metres in the conmparisons and for the final adjustmetnt of these bars as will be shown here after The bars were lettered A B C D for the conve nience of registering them After their first cutting there was enough left in lenigth for the perpendicular filing To bringr tlheni as nearly as posksible to an equal breadth and thickness thirouglhout so as to present for the final adjustment one entir e connected mass they were all four laid close to eachi otlher upon a strong work bench and pressed together by wedges In this position they presented by the sumll of their breadths a surface four inches and a half broad and by that of their thicknesses onie inch and a lhalf They were then filed togetlher witlh one of the circular three inch files of the above tool varying their situation successively on both sides and in all positions By this process they were brought to present in all the combinations an equal breadth and thickness througlhout and to lie together like one mass Havingthus fitted the bars for lying accurately against the filing tool they were filed down nearly to tlheir proper length A proper arrangement was made to extend the horizontal plane of thie iron plate so as to support the whole of the bar rwo of the pieces cut from the ends one five the other seven inches long were adjusted by the filing tool258 SURVEY OF THE COAST like the bars themselves and rubbed witlh emery and oil to serve as butt ends for the final adtjustmenit of the bars To execute this the iron plate of the filing tool was fitted tiglht in the end of a plank so as to conitinue its plane over the wlhole of it to a greater length thian thle bars and the plank was then planed so as to form ani exact continuation of the plane of the iron plate Upon this plaile tlle four bars were laid along side of each otlher pressed togrether be tween brass pins and wvooden wedges and held down by wooden clamps T he ends upon thie plank were butted by a straight liece of wood The ends on the iron plate were rubbed with the seven inch long buttinig piece wvith emery and oil changing their relative position occasionally until their ends presented in all positions one even plane and stmootlh surface uipon whicth tile rubbing piece toucthed equally in all places so as to presenit with them all one even sharp and straight line at tlheir upper surface They were then all turned end for end and made to fit against the five inch iron buttiug piece so as to present again one even and sharp line to whlichi they were of course per pendicular In this position they were again fastened as before and rubbed again witlh the seven inch butting piece changing their relative position until thev presented at these ends also one uniform regular surface and sharp top line The two iron metres of the Committee and Lenoir were then laid upon them and appeared to coincide with them in length This was of course tried several times wishiing however to suffer them to be sotmewhat longer because the cooling down of the metal which is alwavs more or less heated by the working will always shorten them somewhat Indeed I have observed that the copies of measures made in this way are generally shorter than their originals fiotn this circumnstance their conmparison being probably made too soon after the work and before the metal is actually cooled down to thie temperature of the original with which they are comparedOF THE UNITED STATES 259 For the actual comparison of the metres and these bars it was necessary to place them on the work bench on which the above lescribed comparator and English brass scale were at the exact height wlich would bring their upper surface without parallaxto the foci of the microscopes which were of course adjusted for the divisions of the scale The influ cnce of unequally supporting the standard bars by merely laying somnetlling undler them at different places being great I caused pine rules to be made of sufficient breadth and length and of tthe exact thickness required for each stand ard Upon these each standard was laid together with its pioper butting pieces when under comparison As it is wholly inadmissible to take the edge of a bar as an object under the microscope for the purpose of compa rison because it never gives a good image the shorter pieces cut from the bars from two to four inches in length were filed on the tool in the manner of the butting pieces above described brought to the exact tlhickness of the standard with which they were intended to be used and then the butt ing faces of them rubbed against each other with emery and oil upon the ironi plate of the filing tool constantly inverting their positions until such a perfect contact was obtained that the line formed by it was not so thick as one of the di visions of the scale Trhese pieces were always laid against the ends of the standard under comparison so that the junction appeared like a line drawn upoIl the standard with which the cross wires of the nmicrometer were made to intersect The mi croscopes were furnished with reflectors formed of white paper placed in a position inclining forwards between the microscopes and their supports By these the light was reflected upon the scale or the standards in the direction of the division linies as required for accurate reading To prevent the heat of my body from having any influence on the scale and apparatus a large sheet of paper was nailed to the work bench near the microscopes and I worked with gloves on260 SURVEY OF THE COAST From seven to twelve thermometers were laid constantly over the scale and the standards and were read at proper intervals of time Trhe work bench itself was about double the length of the scale It was accurately adjusted before the work and the scale was so placed with respect to the windows of the room that the microscopes received their light from separate win dows The bench was made of two planks tlhree inclhes tlick placed at right angles to each other so that a transverse section was in the form of the letter T The top plank was about twelve inches broad and the wlhole rested oni six legs No fire was kept in the room wlile the compar isons were nmaking and for some tinme before the windows were left open day and night to keep the different parts of the room in an equal temperature being that of the surrounding at mosphere For the comparisons intended to be made in one day every thing was prepared the dav before and left in suclh a state as to require as little handling as possible This was done in order that the parts of the apparatus miglht acquire throughout an equal teniperature All these precautions were necessary to obtain satisfac tory results as is well known to men in the practice of such operations The probable error in the microscopic readings may he considered as increasing with the number of these readings Having four mnetres and the scale being sufficient to take in two I had the means of diminishing this error one half by conmparinig two at a time instead of onie An equation be tween the results thlen enabled me to obtain the value of each metre This method hiad the advantage of removing every prejudice from the mind of the observer in regard to the readings in as much as the combination of the diffe rent measures and the different influience of temperature occasioned a variation which completely precluded previous estimnatesOF THE UNITED STATES 26 t To prepare for readiing the microscopes were placed over the decimals which on the scale corresponded to the length of two metres viz 787 or 788 and this distance was taken from  t to 798 whiclh brought it equidistant froin both ends of thie scale The microscopes were fixed to this distance upon the scale with the greatest care were then left for some time and wetre again verified Tlhe scale was removed and the two metres with their supports pro perlv laid in its place so as to bring the middle of their breadth under the faces of the microscopes The middle contact was exactlv made the butting pieces laid to both ends the coincidence of the end under the microscope with fixed wires effected the middle contact again verified with a magnifying glass the moveable wires of the micrometer mliicroscope moved by the micrometer screw upon the imnage of the contact under its focus and the value of the corre sponlding subdivisions read on the micrometer by its revo lutions and subdivisions The longitudinal motion required to effect the contact can not be conmmunicated by the hand alone the best mode of commnunicating this mnotion is by a few light strokes of a suitable piece of wood applied carefully and in such a matn ner as not to separate the different pieces by the counter stroke rphe value of thie micrometer parts was ascertained by re peated measurements of a decimal in different parts of the scale From a mean of many such measurements with the adjustment of the mlicroscopes used for the metres I found onie decimual on the scale to be measured by one decimlal and four units of the micrometer or 0i of the scale equal to ot004 of the micrometer Lastlv was to be determined the individtual value of the distance on the scale used in the comnparison in relation to the mean valuie of the same distance resultinig from its mea surement taken on as many

are here stated it will be easy to apply any other expansion in the further cal culation of the result if desired The temperature hlaving increased during the comparison with considerable regularity and my work having been un interrupted and uniform from the beginning of each series of comparisons to the end of it the temperature correspond ing to each of the results may be considered equal to the mean temperature between the two observed Trhe tempe ratures adopted in the table of results were therefore deter mined upon this principle I fouind it best to ieduice all comparisons to the tempe rature of 3PO Fahrenhieit or o0 Centesimal and Reaumur for both the brass and iron as we may easily obtain this temperature in nature and it can therefore be presented by experimeht  which would hot be possible if the value of the Frenclh measures at 320 were given in a length of the English brass scale at 620 since this would always introduce a result of mere calculation I shall reduce from iron to brass so that the lengtlh of the metres will be given in En glish inches in brass at the temperature of 320 Fahrenheit The brass metre is therefore in this case considered as need ing no

proves that all co pies of inetres tenid to be shorter than the original fronOF THE UNITED STATES 260 which they are taken from the circuimstance that whenever they are worked either by filing or rubbincr to bring them to the proper length they acquire unavoidably a certain de gree of heat occasioning an expansion wllich does riot sub side fully before the comparisons which direct thie standard ing are finished rhe metre being tlherefore rendered equal to the original under these circumstances will be found too short when it is completely cooled down Thus the me tres made by Lenoir are both shorter than the original metre of the Commnittee of Weights and Measures It is from this consideration that I did not bring the bar fully to the measure but it still remained considerably above the proper length Being however engaged in the comnparison I dis liked changinig it and thereby overthrew a part of nmy work wishing to delay it for a future time On the 21st of Marclh I took the different standards of the toise under comparison The toise of Canivet being half an inich French in thick ness and the English brass scale half an inich Eniglish mea sure the microscopes were adjusted to fit this toise without parallax and then the difference was compensated by laying four thicknesses of white paper strips under the whole length of the scale The other toises had strips of proper thickniesses laid under them to bring them to the same fo cus Trhe distance of 768 whiichi is nearest to the length of the toise was taken between the microscopes fromn 2 to 788 on the scale placing them nearly at equal distances from botlh ends rIhe value of the micrometer was determined by repeated measurements of the decimgl on the scale between 787 and 78s whichl decimal was found to measure of10053 by the micrometer I intended as before to determine their value by other intervals also  but this beinog deferred uintil the end of the operation as well as the determination of the value of the distance used in tnean distance of the scale neither of VOL IIN 227o SURVEY OF THE COAST these measurements has yet been made on account of the interruption niecessary in order to make the pyrometric ex periments before the breaking up of the winter The mi crometer values indicated in the results are however cor rected for the above value and represent therefore actual decimals of the individual subdivision mentioned From this circumstance the comparison remains confined to the distance used on the scale but it may easily be extended by measuring this distance as indicated on as many other parts of the scale as admissible and the difference will probably not be much When the microscopes were screwed fast in their places the oo point of the micromneter did not exactly agree with the division of the scale from which it was intended to read In stead of adjusting it by the screw which guides the slider of the micrometer and the divided head of the screw I pre ferred ascertaining carefully the point of coincidence on the division and on the micrometer and to adopt this last as the 00 point of the micrometer from which the divisions were to be subtracted since the micrometer was read from 7818 backwards or by subtraction The point so determined was 7818001375 or the actual distance from which the readings were subtracted was 768001375 The repetition of the comparisons with the microscopic readings direct which I had also the intention of making was prevented by the circumstances stated above and I never afterwards could bestow any time upon this subject

comparison I know no details This comparison of 1765 reduced to 320 by the results of mny experiments on expansion would give the mean of the two toises of M Lalanle equal to 76742162 What expan sion was used then or whether any correction was applied for it I do not know I have no knowledge of other comn parisons of the toise except that which might be drawn from the deternination of the distance over the British Chan nel by both French and English measures in the operations made by General Roy and by Cassini de Thury for the junction of the Observatories of Paris and Greenwich It is proper that I slhould observe here that the toise of Canivet served to imake the four toises for the base measur ing apparatus which was used in the measurement of the base line of about 42000 feet on the Marsh of Morat in Swltzerland made by Mr J G rralles and myself upon which the triangulation of Switzerland begun by us has been founded Though it is evident that the above comparisons of toisesOF THE UNITED STATES 27g give only individual results yet it may be proper to men tion approximately the ratio they give between the length of the toise and of the metre omitting the toises of Lalande Thlie

of the line wlich forms the base of the whole trian gulation is of the greatest importance This line forms the absolute unit on which all future units depend It is expressed in terms of the unit of length em ployed in its admeasureinent  and the extreme distances of the whole survey referred to it must correspond to the places which astronomical observations assign to them on the earth The measurenment of a line may appear simple anid easy in common life where no minute degree of accuracy is re quired and where commonly the line itself is of no conside rable length In the application to large surveys this fornms the most te dious part of the work and presents in its mechanical exe cution difficulties which have always called forth the inven tive genius of the operators This is not the place to expect a history of the different means employed in determining this line nor to comsment on their comparative advantages or difficulties It may be easily conceived that the most minute care is required to determine the fundamental unit length of a bar or chain to be used in the measurement of a base from the274 SURVEY OF THE COAST standard unit of lengtlh measure and that the standard unit employed in it mlust be well authenticated Ihe means which I used and the authenticity of nmy standards are de tailed in another place to which I must refer for informa tion on this subject I shall only observe that I had pecu liarly authentic and well adapted means to obtain a multi ple of the metre lately determined from the measurements of twelve degrees of the meridian in Europe and to deter mline the length so formed in English measure I was there fore lead to give this multiple the preference and accord ingly I formed bars of eight metres in length which I con sidered as the longest that would be well manageable in the actual measurement of a base line Considering the principles on which the measurement of a base line must depend it is evident that the problenm rew quires t ro determine absolutely in space the extreme points of the unit employed in the measurement 2 To make this line begin at any given point 3 Tro give it a certain determined direction 4 To ascertain its position with respect to the horizon To satisfy the first condition the theory of mathematics applies most generally three rectangular ordinates and it is easily conceived that in this case sometlhingr similar must be mechanically executed by some means or other In all the methods hitherto used the mechanical contact of the bars or chain with the point fromn whiclh either a pre vious bar or a line perpendicular to the direction of the base is measured has been aimed at and as the moving of the bars in their perpendicular direction presents much difficul ty on account of their weight and friction this has been ob viated by small sliders measuring the intervals between the bars laid near each other in the direction occasioning of course a vernier reading whichrequired inuch care and at tention to small quantities I consilered an optical contact of the ends of the bar with the determined point preferable to any otlher both for acvOF THE UNITED STATES 275 curacy and easy manipulation and I obtained it in as perfect a manner as possible ly nmeanis of the following arrange ment This part of the apparatus is a microscopic arrangement of which Plate 1II fig 1 pireseints a vertical section of about the fourth part of their real size showing all the screw mio tions in the direction of the three rectangular ordinates A conmpound microscope aa about seven inches long is kept in a vertical position by passing through two ho rizontal plates bb projecting frorn two columns ee It can be raised or lowered to bring it to the proper focal dis tance and then held fast by the screws dd which press the spring of the circular part of the plates bb togethier The object glass of this microscope is formed of two halves of lenses of different foci The one half will bring tthe image of a cobweb thread stretched over the end of the bar at e about three inches from the lens to the focus of the eye lenses the other half lens will bring to the same focus the image of the rectangular crossing of two lines traced on a small plate of ivory h which is screwed to the middle of the thick brass plate ii at about six inches from the object lens and adjusted in the collimation line of the microscope The ends of the bar lhave tlhrough the middle of tlheir breadth a semicircular opening to admit the cobweb to be stretched across it and to admit more light from the point h to come to the microscope as seen in its natural size in the hiorizon tal section at g In usig the apparatus the images above nmentioned alre to be brouglht in contact as in a reflecting instrument either by the screw of the microscope or that of the bar as the case may require As the cobweb thread at the end of the bar is perpendicular to the direction of the base it is best to place the rectangular crossing lines on the ivory plate so as to make angles of 45 with the direction of the base The contact will then be effected by making the image of the cob web bisect the right angle thus formed The microscopes themselves are to be placed so that the line dividing the two276 SURVEY OF THE COAST half lenses may be in the direction of the base or bars in order that the light from both objects mtiay be as equal as possible whiich would not always be the case in any other pvsition lThe microscope must of course be placed at the p oper distanice fronm the point h so as to present a distinct inmage of this point It is evident that by this arrangement the optical contact obtained is sinmilar to that of the nmicroscope reading on a cir cular instrument and can be niade with great ease and ac curacy The deternmination of the point of contact in the vertical direction is equally accurate for the limit of only tolerable vision in the compound microscope which for the cobweb has about three inches focal distance is already very narrow and withini less than onetwentieth of ani inch This would lhardly affect the level of the bars and still less the difference betweeni hypothenuse and base Butwhen the vision is carried to distinictness it will be totally destroyed The two horizontal imotions required to place the point h and the microscope are made in the direction perpendi cular to the bars by the screw kk revolving in the end pieces ot the llate ii and working in tthe socket whichi projects above the middle of the lower plate jj In the direction of

the bar i to the focus of the microscope by a pin and handle fitted to the holes of the capstan head t TIhe legs rr whlich support this apparatus are of wood and a number of them of different lengths should be pre pred to suit the inequalities of the ground within the limits of the niotion of the triangular bar pp by which the nearer adjustment to the focus is made They screw in brass fer rules which serve to connect them to the solid piece qq In the actual use of the apparatus it is necessary to have at least three such microscopic arrangements that while two of thlem are used before the third may be left behind for re ference in case of accident This arrangement will be taken forward when the bar is laid off the second time TIhe point h so determined in space becomes that from which when the bar is moved forwards the further mea surenient is to begini By means of this apparatus it remains steady in its place and the bar when laid down in the next position is adjusted by making the cobweb at the other end couincide with the focus of the half lens corresponding to it as at g all motions are then made by the screw work on the bar apparatus of which a description shall immediately be given IThe second and third requisites make it necessary thiat the bar which is to measure the distance should be adjusta ble in all directions It will immediately be seen that the longitudlinal motion is attended with the most friction and must on that account be impeded as little as possible This precaution however seems to have been overlooked in the VOL I1O 2278 SURVEY OF

thickness as the meties constructed and standarded by the Conintii tee of Weights and Measules in Paris in 1799  They are joined together end to end by means of two iron clamping pieces AA a section of which perpendicular to the bars is seen in onefourth of its real size in Plate I fig 2 Each of thiese pieces being clamped to its bar by the screw B the two corresponding pieces of the adjoining bars are screwed in order to make the contact of the bars by the longitudinal screws CC above and below the bars The bars can be ea sily brought in contact as any gal would be immnediately observed and there is no fear of compression because the instant of contact is easily ascertained and before any com pressioni of the metal could take place the friction of the screws B would give way and restore equilibrium and con tact This assemblage of bars stands edgeways upon rollers F of onethlird of an inch in diameter placed at short distanlces so that each double metre bar mav have four in

the breadth of the box or distance of the directing telescope from its nmiddle must be consi dered in viewing the signals used in the alignments of the base This condition will be satisfied by mnaking the breadtl of the signals equal to that of the box and by directing the telescope to the proper side of each signal in the fore and back observations In relation to thle fourth requisite of the apparatus for measuring base lines viz the ascertaining of the position of eacl part towards the horizon the sinmplest and easiest mode might seem to be to measure the line actually horizontal and in case a difference of level should occur in which it would be too inconvenient to follow the same level to fall or rise to a different level by means of a plumb linle But this mode should not be adopted when great accuracy is re quired as experience would soon prove to an attenitive ope rator The deviations from the level to be obtained will increase so as to be unsatisfactory and the placing of the apparatus will be found too tedious and at the sanme time liable to inaccuracy Thie measurements were generally taken as near as pos sible to the soil This supposes of course that the lines mea sured in the intervals were all straight lines which probably was not the case I considered that the shortest as well as most accurate mode of proceeding was to ascertain the true position of each bar when it was actually employed in the operation Horizontal measurements however should be taken when ever the ground is favourable to them and when this is not the case the tripods should be fixed to the proper inclina tion by means of the level above mentionedOF THE UNITED STATES 28 Tlhe focal point of the cobweb oni the bar being determined withi great accuracy in respect to its elevation as is evident from tiie absenice of parallax between thie two objects we may mseasure firom it in any inclination that occurs without fear of error in thie distance Trhe following is the arrangement added to the bar appa ratus to measure this inclination It is seen in botlh figures of Plate IV but more particularly in Plate 111 fig 4 5 e fi Upon the strongr brass frame K formning the leadinig part of the wooden bar H a sector of ten inches radius is screweed by its strong edge bar mm fig 4 and presents itself verti tically its centre being at h and the divided arc g at the side of the lhead I of the screw Q It containis an arc of uipwards of thirty degrees Upon the alliidade of this sector thlere is a spirit level of about seven inclhes long adjustable to the 0 of the sector by the screw i wlhich makes it rievolve about the poinlt k The alhidade being mioved bIy the tangent screw racking in the circumference of the are g until the level be obtained with the allbidade corresponding to any in clination of the apparatus the reading of the vernier on the arc will indicate the inclination of the apparatus or the bars to which the sector has been adjusted For the reduction of the inclined distances to the horizon tals it is evident that a table of differences between the hy potenuse and base of a right angled triangle can be con structed to any degree of accuracy desired the quantities of wlich referring always to the same unit viz the length of one full svstem of bars will be taken out without any calcu lation and their sum can be subtracted from the sum total at once Respecting the thermometers it will not be niecessary to say any thing here as it is easily conceived that they must all be read at each laving Of a box I might now lescribe the manilulation of this apparatus in the actual measurement of a base line but I consider the use of each part of it so obvious to a person sufficiently ac284 SURVEY OF TIM COAS1 quainted withi these subjects as to render such description unnecessary Platc IV presents 1oth a horizonital atid ver tical view of the whole apparatus as when actually employed in the measurement IThe safe transportation of the boxes between their placing and removal from under thie microscopes will require con siderable care and also an arrangement to prevent the box from being put out of slhape in carrying it upon uneveni ground and by whiich in an extreme case even the bars might lose their contact It will therefore be proper to ad just these bars in case of any suspicion of this kind Thiere being two complete sets of instrutments in the col lection intended for the survey and a case seldom occurring in whiich bothi sets shall be employed at the samne time it may be convenient to use mnore than one full set in an operation For instance take more than three microscope stands For greater security take the directing telescope of the set not in use to make the back verifications of the line by placing it at the other side and end of the box Take additional rol lers thermomneters clhanges of legs tripods 4c 1c The manner in which the journal of the measurement of a base line should be kept requires minute care on account of the great number of observations and remarks to be in serted I would here give a sketch or extract of such a jour nal had I completed the measurement of a line witlh this appa ratus  but the survey of the coast was interrupted before this could be effected I shall however insert a few remarks which occurred to me in Switzerland when measuring with Mr Tralles now Member of the Academy of Berlin in 1791 and 1797 a base line of about 42000 feet in length and upon which the triangulation was founded This base was mea suired twice first with a chain similar to that made by Ramsden for the English surveyand secondly with an ap paratus of four toise bars somewhiat similar to that above de scribed I shall place these remarks under the following headsOF THE UNITED STATES 285 1 It is necessarvto miiark in the preliminary measure merit and the alignmsent of the base a numxber of poitits at equal and moderate distances ftonm each other so that at least one of these points may be found in eachi days work of the accurate measuremnent for the purpose of showing whie tlher the length of a bar had been omitted or written twice 2 The journal must have regular columntis for thle olser vations made at thie laying off of each box and a column should be left for inicidental remarks the first coluimn slhow ing tlle numtiber of eachi bar fromn tlhe beginning to the end 3 The time at which the adjustment of each bar is effect ed by the microscopic apparatus should be noted to the near est mninute This may be entered in thie second columnn It is evident that this will serve to check the registering of the bars by showing whether any mistake had been tmiale that was not accounted for in the remarks inserted in the left co lumn 4 The stand of the sector indicating the position of the bar towards the horizon together with the stands of the se veral thermiiiometers mlarked and placed after each other in the order in whichi they have been read should occupy the third or next column 5 The points of coincidence of each of the marks stated in Art 1 with the bar or any fraction of it must be carefully marked in thie next column Likewise the passage of any ditch fence or other permanent object that may be of use in finding any particular point in the line after having pass ed it 6 At every fifty or hundred bars a nmark shouild be left behind so accurately determined that in case of accident the measuremetnt mioht be again made from it without the necessity of returning to the beginning These marks should be numbered and thie time of placing them should be writ ten in the journal 7 In the evening or at anv other tinme when the work is suspeplled thle place of the last mnicroscope apparatus taken off should he marked and registered in the jouirnal VOL IIP 2286 SURVEY OF

covered with a tent and well secured A tent made for this purpose with others made for the microscope stands was deliveredwith the apparatus 9 Notwithstanding all these precautions it will be proper

divisions are read off rE hese microscopes are six inches long and with a mag nifving power of ahout fourteen times They are marked A B C in the direction of the numbers of the gradation The degrees

visible by the microscope wlhen laid out so as to point close to the divi sion without however touching the arch in order not to scratch it The field of the microscopes embraces about 45 minutes of the division so that there is never aily diffi culty in reading the smaller parts The thirty nminute marks being extended entirely across like those of degrees and the degrees distinguished by a strong dot in the protracted part of the line always one or the other appearing in the field The micrometer heads nn read in the inverted direction on account of the inversion of the image by thie

make the final adjust ment to thedivision point or the distance between the mi croscopes desired After some experience I have however found it best not to adjust the microscopes to 1200 distance as it appears to me that the influence of a little deviation in this respect may be wholly neglected in comparison with the advantages of having the microscopes fixed simply in the middle of their holding pieces qq which makes them more firm and places the 00 point of the micrometer in the mniddle of the field of vision I used themn therefore always in thiis position in which they remained perfectly steady and which gave be sides a kind of moral advantage from the circunmstance that as the readings became thus different in minutes and seconds for each microscope the observer remains entitely unpreju diced as to what he should read at each microscope and eachi reading becomes thereby equally indepenident and im partial Upon the drutn i are two spirit levels four inches long at righlt angles to each other to serve for the first approximate levelling of the instruments which I found under tolerablyOF THE UNITED STATES 29i favourable circumstances of temperature always exceeding ly correct and rivalling the latge upper level when that nicety of adjustment was observed which their smaller scale naturally required The transit telescope which forms the upper part of this instrument and by which the angles are observed is sup ported by two columns fifteen inches high screwed upon the drum at right angles to the microscope A ln travelling thlese columns are unscrewed at oo to prevent the box in which they are carried from being top heavy and more ef fectually to secure them fronm injury though I lhad the box also fitted to receive them with the instrument in some cases in order not to disturb the upper adjustments of the instrument At the lower part of the drum in the direction of the two columns towards thie light from the microscope A is the arm k made broad but thin so as to have sufficient strength in the horizontal direction anid yet very little friction on the limb This lhas the clamping and tangent screws and pre sents itself always conveniiently to the hand in all positions of the instrument towards the observer The tops of the two vertical columns bear two pieces yy projecting outwards to admit the axis twelve inches in length of the transit telescope which is supported between them in rectangular Ys as usual In one of these pieces at r is a screw with a capstan head showing through a cut in the side which bears by the head upwards against the

differences of level can be measured as a very fine large spirit level can be bung lengthways to the telescope by two aUjustable steel pins on the side of the tube not seen in the figure The vertical wires are of course adjustable like those of any transit instrument by two opposite screws on the sides as d The miiddle piece of the transit is a zone of a sphere of five inches in diameter to which the two parts of thle teles cope are screwed in diametrically opposite directions and at right angles to these the two trtuncated cones forming the axis Their base is a circle drawn on the cord of about tj2oo of the central sphere It diminishes to threefourths of an inch at thie other end to receive the hell metal axis piece of half an inch in diameter This shape presents a great strength of

vernier arms clamp thiese and the level by the fingerscrew The level being adjusted by hand when so clamped the te lescope will in revolving read vertical angles with sufficient approximation to serve for finding a star or determining any other elevation within a certain degree of accuracy The adjustment of the axis of the telescope and the final levelling of the instrument are effected by nmeans of a large spirit level w suspended by hooks from botlh ends of tthe axis outside of the supports y y As the space immediately under the axis is not free it lhangs on each side close to the colunmns It is purposely without adjusting screws and is therefore brought to adjuistment by the filing of its hooks  and as thie level is ground to a regular curve inside the nice adjustment is made by two small ivory scales sliding upon the level by two sections of tube holding to it by their spring This is the arrangement of all the larger levels of the instru ments excepting those of the repeating circles Below the horizontal circle is a verification telescope sus pended in hooks from two opposite conical radii b b exactly similar in size and construction to the upper telescope but of course without a vertical circle The eye end has a miclometer arrangement similar to the upper telescope with one fixed wire in the direction of the length of the micrometer and three wires perpendicular to it moveable by the micrometer screw The whole micro meter arrangement stands at an inclination of about 15 with the horizon so as to increase the chances of intersection with any distinct object within the field of the telescope VOL IIQ 2204 SURVEY OF THIE COAST The object end has a lengthening tube giving to this part some preponderance by which the eye end is pressed up wards against an arrangement of three small sliding tubes x which reach downwards fromn the limb of the circle and present the rounded end of the finger screw z to the upper part of the telescope By the sliding of ttese tubes and the finial adjustment by the screw z and the micrometer arrange ment the accurate pointing upon an object for the sake of verification is obtained As it cannot be my object here to go into such detailvs of description as must be considered geneitally known the above is I believe sufficient to explaini all the peculiatities of the instruments and to detail their principles and use Methods of Observting with the Twofeet Theodolite The limits assigned to the present papers rendered it ne cessary in the description of this instrument to suppose that a general idea of it might be obtained from the figures there given The same reason now compels me to consider the general principles and method of levelling it together with the adjustment of its line of collimation and axis as well known and to confine myself to the explanation of its pe culiar properties and of some theoretical principles and prac tical advantages not hitherto treated of at least to my know ledge An observer furnished with an instruiment with whiclh he has never observed should first ascertain its properties and defects from the mathematical principles on which it is constructed Trhis will be more indispensable when the in strument has had to undergo transportation In this inquirv he will be much assistedif besides hisOF THE UNITED STATES 295 general scientific knowledge hle is acquainted with the man ner in which the instrument has beeni constructed and the peculiar abilities of the artist who constructed it Judging from these circumstances the possible and proportional ac curacy of the execution of the instrument he will be able to direct his inquiry sooner to a satisfactory result In an instrument which is as perfect as possible the ad justinents are of course only accurate within certain limits and he has to guard against the errors which hie nmay be lia ble to in consequence of them as vell as against tlhose of the instrument itself It becomes tlherefore the duty of an accurate observer in no case to rely merely upon the accuracy of his instrumenit and his own skill but to adopt such a method of observing as will couinteract as far as possible tle errors of the instru nient andw those to which he hinmself is liable in making his observations Without sucll a method and a regular system in his obser vations his mean results will be under the influence of ha zard and may even be relidered useless by adding an o1 servation whiclh would repeat an error already included in another observation It is possible to correct angles measured by an incorrect or ill adjusted instrument by inathematical formulh when the data for the reduiction are exactly known but suclh data are always difficult to ascertain with sufficient accuracy The reductions require longer calculations than the obser vations themnselves or at least are more tedious than a re petition of thie obser vations In a work of great extent these reductions occur so frequentlv and the calculations of the observations are at the same time so numerous as to render any metlhod in which it would be necessary to retain them extrenmelv laborious On the otther hand the observations mav always be repeated in a way in which these corrections will compensate each other As to the instrument intended for the survey which is the296 SURVEY OF THE COAST subject of the present papers I bad reason to entertain the highest expectations It was executed under my own in spection by that distinguished artist Mr Edward Troughton of London agreeably to our united views and with that in terest for its success which the great friendship with which he was pleased to favour mie could alone inspire The actual operations made at a station of a survey on solid ground in a proper place with good signals 5c are in every respect best adapted for the trial of the instruments and for devising a proper method of observing with them From the remarks which will be found in their proper place on the nmethod of dividing used in England it may be observed and has been observed already by Ramsden in de scribing his dividing engine that the exact placing of the axis in the centre of the division is still effected by trials and indirect means and that when obtained exact it may even lose this position by transportation or accident It will there fore he proper to inquire whether the instrument be well centred or not and at all eveents to use the indiscriminate mean of the two or more equidistant readings which are now made on every instrument as one sinigle reading would be affected by the whole error of the eccentricity The half sum of any two vertical arcs in a circle is equal to the arc at the centre Therefore the indiscriminate mean of any even number of opposite readings on an instrument will be equal to the angle at the centre Also the third of of three angles at the same point out of the centre of the circle is equal to the angle at the centre of the circle And in general it will be seen that the indiscriminate mean of any number of equidistant readings will be equal to the angle at the centre of the circle This property is new as far as I know and nmay be demonstrated as follows Plate V fig iLet C be the centre of the division C the centre of motion d the poinit on the limb marking the read ing of the alhidade Cdthe radius of the division Then CCM is the line

cause the axis of motion not to be perpendicular to the divided plane of the circle The axis be ing placed vertical ly the adjustment of the instrument the plane of motion thus horizontal will not coincide with that of the divided circle upon which the readings are made and will require a reduction to the imaginary horizontal plane which will be exactly analogous to the reduction of the ec liptic to the equator and may be determined by the formula given for that lurpose It is evident that in changing the position of the instrument so as to make the legs successively change their places the plane of the circle will be placed in the same symmetrical positions with respect to any angle measured upon it as was the case in the readings of the angle and the angles will require successive reductions corresponding to the same number of symmetrical arcs The indiscriminate mean of these angles observed in all these positions will again be the true horizontal angle cor rected for the want

in aritline tical progression litnited by the sumn of the os being equal to thie circumference of the circle which makes their sum 0 and proves the indiscriminate mean of the angles ob served in the symmetric positions of the instrument to be the accurate horizontal angle In an eccenitric instrument it is of course impossible to make the nmicroscopes measure exactly in all parts of tthe division but the above shows that if they are adjusted in any one position their measure will be corrected by thie clhanges of position of the instrument without having re course to any other nmeans Errors nay also arise from a want of horizontality in the axis of tlhe instrument It is proper tlherefore to adapt the mtethod of observing so as to correct these errors But such errors are easily corrected in this instrument by observing with the telescope in two positions diametrically opposite to eaclh othler In Plate VI fig 2 let ab be the horizontal line in which the axis should be and tp the section of the true vertical plane which the telescope should describe Instead of this let the axis be inclined in one position of the instrunment so that the telescope moves round the line ab and describes a circle making with the vertical an angle totacabcb All the results of observations on objects taken in this plane will require a reduction corresponding to this angle Turning the telescope so as to revolve through a semicircumference ho rizontally and vertically and observing the same objects acgain without any change of thle adjustments of the transit the axis will come in the direction ab and the plane of revolution of the telescope will make with the vertical the angle tct tct but on the side exactly opposite All results of ob servations will require exactly the same correction as before in respect to quiantity but they will be negative in respect to the former and the indiscriminate mean of the two will be VOL IIR 2302 SURVEY OF THE COAST as before the true angle between the verticals of the observed objects this operation will besides bring the lhorizontal angle ex actly to the points of the circle diametrically opposite to the formner and will again act as a correction in the same sense as the two mlentioned before An error in the line of collimation will of course combine with that of the verticality of the circle described by the teles cope anid be corrected lartially by the double operation but this adjustment is easily verified in this instrument An iriegularity in the axes of motion of the instrument would of course have an influence on the observations but in the horizontal angles it is evident that this influence would be destroyed by tlhe exactly inverted positiors of the instrument in which the observations are made This erroio therefore falls in with all the others which appear of course always combined and are finally compensated by a certain determined number of observations systetnatically ar raniged The only cause of error still remaining is thie accidental error of any particular division which might have been used in the series of angles rhis chance can occur only by some particular accident in the work as the dividing engine of Mr Troughton is so regular and his attention and care so great that the error of the division may be supposed a minimum The displacement of my microscopes from their exact distance of 1200 was too small to produce any influence on the accuracy of the compensations tTpon the principles here demonstrated I grounded the following method of observing all horizontal angles with the twofeet theodolite 1 Having carefuilly adjusted the instrument inmall respects the telescope is placed in such a position as to bring its eve end perpendicularly over the microscope A In this pnsi tion which I call direct I observe all the objects between which I intend to determine the angles at the timre 2 Then I turn the telescope round vertically so as toOF THE UNITED STATES 303 bring the object end of it perpendicularly over the micros cope A which position 1 call reversed and observe the same objects which I had observed before without any al teration1 in the adjustments of the instrument not even its general levelling if there lhas been no accidental derange ment but in every case without any alteration whatever in the adjustments of the transit telescope 3 Theni the theodolite itself is turned round horizontally for one change of legs or about 1200 So that all angles will now be read by each microscope at i2o0 from the for mer situation In this position the instrument is again care fLlly levelled and adjusted in all respects 4 In this second position the two operations before de scribed are repeated  that is the same objects are again ob served in both the direct and the reversed position of the transit 5 After this the theodolite is again nmoved horizontally for one change of legs in the same direction as before so as to come into the third possible situation and each micros cope to read again on the limb at 1200 from its former situ ation 6 In this third position the same objects are again ob served both in the direct and in the reversed position of the transit after the instrument has been adjusted in all respects as in any one of the two former positions By this method each angle is observed six times in the systenatic order required for thle compensation of all errors arising from the causes lheretofore treated and with muclh less trouble than if an equal numnber of observations were made by the merely accidental positions of the instrument and as many observations would most probably be taken at all events of such points as would be considered as requiring great accuracy Thlle finial angles are thus determined by the influence of eighteen angles on parts of the division sym metrically situated Experience has completely sanctioned this method of ob 2804 SURVEY OF THE COAST serving by an accuracy in the final results never obtained without it I must hiere observe in relation to the actual application of tbis nmethod of observing in nmy trianigulation for the sur vey of the coast that it will not be found to have been ri gorously followed because it was the result rather than the elemnent of that part of tle work which I could execute The necessity of advancing in the work at the samne time that I was bringing my method of observing to perfection both by theoretical researches and by practice caused miie to nmake use of all the observations obtained for both purposes In the examples of the DayBook and the Journal of Re sults inserted at the end of the paper will be seen some fully registered in proper order These are taken from the work on the Boundary Line with Canada as I had not the oppor tunity of referring to anv of my journals from the survey having delivered them to the War Department The observations of the azimuths of celestial bodies par ticularly of the sun are very accurate and easy with this in strument They shouldl unite in one final result a comnplete system of the above compensating method of observing be sides an equal number of observations made six hours before and after the transit of the lheavenly body used rhis com bination is necessary in order to render thle elements for the calculations of the azimuths compensating to each other and the influence of their error the smallest possible as well as to make the observations the most favourable and accu rate A full result of azimuths must therefore consist of twelve observations which is not more than the number which would of choice be given to this element of the triangulation With respect to the instrument it will be the mean of thirtysix angles symmetrically situated upon the circle so that the accuracy thus obtained must prove very satisfactory In case that this complete series of observations cannot be oh tained on a station the only correction which may be omit ted is that of the change of the theodolite upon its legs AllOP THE UNITED STATES 305 the others are completely indispensable for obtaining a sa tisfactory result In observing the celestial body its transit is observed on all the three vertical wires of the telescope and when the sun is observed which is the most advantageous of all for azinmuth deternminations the contacts of both limbs are taken By this mode of observing which is very easy and even very pleasant with this instrument the most essential element of the azimuths the time is observed six times with the sun for each observation which is of course a great advantage as to accuracy I should even have wished that the telescope had five vertical wires instead of three The following is the order which I followed in such an obser vation Having carefully verified all the adjustments of the instru ment and the telescope being in the position which I have called direct I observedfirst the terrestrial object with which thie azimuth was to be taken choosingfor it the signal which by its illumination at the time appeared the most distinct and in case of equality in this respect that nearest to the sun and read offt the three microscopes Then I turned the telescope horizontally so as to receive the transit of both limbs of the sun at all the three vertical wires and having clamped the telescope in this position I observed these tran sits the tine of each being catefuilly observed bv a chrono meter or clock to seconds and decimahg and written in the daybook by thie secretary After this I read the three nmi croscopes on the circle Then I placed the telescope immediately in the reversed position and olbserved the transit of the sun again as before and after it the same terrestrial object again By this methiod the two azimuths are observed the near est possible to eaclh other and the terrestrial objects observ ed correspond to each position of the transit If the circunmstances allow one more azimuth to he taken without however admittinog the chlange of the inistrument upon its legs and an assistant be at hand to deterniiuie the306 SURVEY OP THE COAST time by the chronometer or clock without taking the ob server away from the azimuth then the above second ob servation of the terrestrial object in the reversed position of the transit can be followed immediately by one of the sun in the same position of the transit and returning the teles cope to the direct position one can again be made in this position and the terrestrial object observed again for verifica tions sake the terrestrial observation in the reversed situ ation serving for both azimuths in that position Thus four azimuths each from six transits of tlle suns linmb at the ver tical wires can be observed in a very short space of time It is evidenit that these azimuth observations would when ever found necessary be very well suited for the reduction to the mean time according to the method invetnted by Mr Soldner It is proper to make the azimuths as independent of the rate of the timepiece as possible and therefore to make ob servations of time as nearly as possible before and after those of the azimuths and if several observers should be together a proper combination which would admit both observations to be made at the same time would be very advantageous The calculation of the result can of course be varied be ing made either for eaclh limbs transit or as I did for each transit of the centre but it is not allowed to take direct and reversed observations together in the sanme calculation The formii of such an observation and the manner of re gistering the results will be seen in the corresponding ex amnples of the DayBook and Journal of Results I will here describe another nmethod of observing azinmuthls which may be of use in circumstances wlhich admit only a portable transit and the means of determining the timie I applied it in 1793 in Switzerland and it may sometimes be preferable to a measuretnent on a less accurate instrument I adjust the transit telescope exactly in the vertical of the object before the time when the sun will pass this vertical and observingthe transit of both limbs on all the wires the time of the transit of the centre is thus obtained and it isOF THE UNITED STATES 307 evident that the result of the calculation of the azimuth of thie sun will give at tthe samle time the azimnuth of the object the time being determiined by proper means as near to this observation as possible In this manner the azimuths of all objects in the vertical of which the sun passes in the day on both sides of the zenith may be determined and the terrestrial angles between them be tolerably well ascer tained By the same metlhod also an astronomical circle well ad justed in the vertical nmay serve for the determination of azinmuths and when it is required to lay off certain direc tions on thie earth signals may be placed purposely to ob serve azimuths upon themn by this mnethod and if the sun should not at the time pass such a vertical a star properly situLated should be chosen for the purpose It is proper in this place to introduce some practical re mnarks relative to the illumination of the division which has a considerable influence on the accuracy and facility of the reading rhe light upon the divisions nmust be reflected from a white unpolished plane it mnust fall upon the divi sions in the direction of their length and not fr onm the side  and if the reflection from the limb enter the microscope the greatest light will be obtained All glaring light will be im proper I founid white paper the most proper surface and for this purpose I folded a quarto sheet into an octavo form and to give it more solidity folded rims to the open sides then giving to this again a fold in the middle so as to make the two parts stand at right angles with each other in the middle of one half I cut a circular hole exactly fitting the microscope tule below its holder and adapted to it by its close fitting The screw going over the wlhole length of the tube it kept its position and the other half hung down to within a short distance of the litmib of the circle outside tlhe reflecting surface being tlhus a tangent to it and nearly perpendicular to the limb WIien the observer stands in the direction of the radius of the microscope the light comes as from the centre of the instrument reflected in the satne308 SURVEY OF THE COAST direction and presents the divisions without any false shade and very distinct In any other position of thie light or of the reflection the strokes which always present cavities though they appear filled will be viewed on thbe side as one side of this cavity will always be in the light and the other in the shade and the inifluence of this upon the accuracy of the reading is much greater than might be imagined exceed ing the limits within whiclh it is possible to read with these nmicroscopes For this same reason night observations have not the same degree of accuracy on the horizontal limb of a theodolite as those made during the day  because in this case it is impos sible to make the light fall in the proper direction as no light can be placed in the centre and outside in the direction of the radius it would occupy the place belonging to the ob server Night azimuths lose miuch on that account and sel dom give the satisfaction expected  On the Signals and the Systenz of Wires in the Telescope An object closelv connected with the accuracy of the ob servation of terrestrial angles is the choice of proper and dis tinct signals ind the adaptation of the system of wires to them In the first place I must observe that objects seen firom a great distance are visible rathier in proportion to their differ ence in light and colour from the surrounding objects or the back gr ound on which they ate projected than in proportion to their size which actually contributes very little towards the effecting of the vision and is always detrimental to its distinctness A small object seen by the shaded side if pro jected uponi a clear sky will be visible at a great distance and will be much more distinct if it reftect the rays of theOF THE UNITED STATES 309 sun to the observer These remarks must certainly have been often made and yet I hiave not seen that advantage has ever been taken of them for the purpose here in view A staff is always a bad signal as it will always be seen differently according to the state of the illumination and if it is furnished with a flag for the purpose of discovering and discerning it from other similar objects this will easily mnis lead the observer as to its actual position and certainly make it appear to stand out of the perpendicular if at any conside rable distance Truncated pyramids are inconveniently large and require peculiar reductions according to the side of them which is observable and which nmay even change in the course of the short time of observation by the change of the illumination For the vertical angles the staff cannot serve at all rhe point at which it is fastened into the earth can never be as certained with certainty as it may be hidden by uneven ground before or the ground frotm behind upon which it is projected may be mistaken for it Truncated pyranmids may be seen of different heights in different states of the atmios phere A signal showing itself detached from the ground on whicl it stands will also be distinguished far better than a much larger one connected with the ground All these remarks I might support with daily experience of which it will suffice to mention that in a warm summer day the gilt ball of a steeple may be seen at a great distance when the steeple itself is only supposed and not actually dis tinguished Making in 1798 a triangulation in Switzerland with a re peating circle with two telescopes where the angles are measured in the plane of the objects and the determination of the elevation of the triangle points being an object of in terest I was desirous of a distinct signal which should he seen equally in all directions this lead me to the idea of forming spheres elevated on poles They were formed of barrel VOL IIS 2310 SURVEY OF THE COAST hoops making the ribs of the sphere and covered withi white linen Their diameters were fromi sixteen to twenty inches They were very distinctly visible withi the telescope on my instrumnent thiough onlv thirteen inches in lenigtl at a distance of fifty miles and as far as ten tniles with the na ked eye but they did not answer equally well in the lower atmosphere of this country near thie sea shiore as was to be expected I was therefore induced to use a kitnd of sig nals presenting a luminous point by the reflection of the sun and adapted to the situation of that body at such times of the day as fromn the general state of illumination appeared to be most favourable to observation In the middle of the day the illunmination will not serve at all for distinct vision and even the largest objects become indistinct on account of the vapour as this is comnmonly called or rather because the reflidction of the light from all objects goes upwards and loes not meet the eye of the observer on the surface of the earth As the cheapest reflecting surface which I could choose was sheet tin andthie construction of spheres became more difficult and expensive and the spheres themselves always presented a small point I chose the form of a truncated cone unler such an angle as would be the most favourable for the nmorning anid evening illuminiation The next poirnt whiich appeared desirable with respect to the signals was to find their places in case thev should be removed The means which I considered as best adapted for the purpose were the following Plate VI fig 4aabb is a truncated cone of tin the height ab equal to nineteen inches the lower diameter aa equal to seventeen inches the upper diatneter bb equal to fourteen inches the top e is a horizontal tin plate of three inches diameter elevated five inches above the diamneter bb which serves to nail the signal to the top of the pole ef and from which to thie diameter bb it forms a truncated cone of a greater vertical angle rThe pole ef uipon wlhich the signal is fastened is about three or four inchles in diameter and ofOF THRE UNITED STATES 311 such length as to bring the top e of the signal about eight or nine feet above the ground at g rhe tin cone is held stea dy in its vertical position by two iron wires fastened at the lower rim aa of the cone in diametrically opposite places and wound round the pole and making right angles with each other To place a signal a hole was dug in the ground to the depthi of about three or four feet and of proportional width and a permanent mark was then placed properly centred in the station These marks consisted of trunicated hollow cones of hiard baked stoneware open at top and bottom their height ed equal to sixteen inches the inner diameter at the top cc equal to six inches the lower dianmeter dd equal to twelve inclhes They were at such a distance below the surface of the ground as to be perfectly secured from acci dents arisingfrom ploughing t5c The signals can be pulled out of these cones perpendicu larly and the holes filled with carth so as to leave no appa rent mark while at any future time the cones can be easily uncovered and being enmptied of earth without being dis placed they will be prepared to receive other signials These signals answered in every respect perfectly well and though constructed of apparently costlier materials than rough signals the expense attending thern with the perma nent mark in the ground tc amounted only to about three dollars and a half eacha suim for which no pyramid or any thing similar couild be constructed In favourable circumstances these signals appeared like a strong lIiuninous point often requiring when the signals were near thie use of a dark glass before the eye Their form then became as distinctly visible as the limbs of a pla net In distances of thirty to forty miles they presented a dis tinct luminous point when the sun was in such a situation as to reflect its rays directly to the observer which time is of sufficient duration c2312 SURVEY OF THE COAST It is evident that the luminous point which was observed on the tin cone depended on the angle which the sun sub tended witlh the line fiom the observer to tle signal and requiired of course a small reductiotn to the cenitre of the sig nal ro obtain this elementof reduction easily I observed always at intervals the sun to the niearest degree only as no great accuracy is required by placing the telescope of the instrument in the slhade formed by itself and reading the stand of thie microscope A on the limb Calculating the ap parent angle subtended by the mean radius of the signial cone for each distance I formed a snmall table and placed it at the head of eachI station in the Journal of Results TFhe re duction was very easy and was quiickly made by a construc tion and a short multiplication of decimals of whichi it is proper to give here the explanation as well in principle as in practice In Plate VI fig 5 let a be the station point of the obser ver c the cenitre of a signal observed from this station lbd the mean circumference of the tin cone and as the direction in which the sun is seen from the station at the time of the observation For the purpose here intended it is perfectly allowable to omit the correction of the azimuth of the sun between the station point and that of the signal which would be propor tionate to the convergency of the mneridians and also to suppose the lines drawn from the different parts of the sig nal to the observer as parallel wlhich would vary always less than the apparent radius of the signal This permits us to suppose dascasccsfds By the principles of reflection the point on the circuimfe rence of the cone which will be reflected to the point a will lie at d the middle of the angle sca supplement to the angle observed between the sun and the signal The correction will therefore be proportional to de the sine of acdsca or to the cosine of the complement of it that is to cosine cas or half the angle between the sun and the signalOF THE UNITED STATES 313 Expressing tlherefore the radius cd by the seconds and de cimals which it subtends at the station a the multiplication of this by the cosine of half the angle observed gave the ap propriate correction or corr cdcos 1 cas To construct this correction with great ease I divided a quadrant on pasteboard of onie foot radius numbered with the double angles as in a reflecting instrument beginning to count as if from the point of thie circle perpendicular to ca wlhicth represents of course the position of the sun in the pro traction of ac behind the signal rhis radius was divided into ten parts and lines drawn perpendicular to it cutting the circumference in the corresponding points indicatinlg the angles to which they correspond Upon a smaller piece cut at right angles one of these decimals was divided into teIn parts again this piece being slided along the line near est to the angle observed between the sun and the signal tlle subdivisions of it beinig perpendicular to the same until these intersected the circumference at the actual observed angle the tenths and lhundredths of the radius correspond ing to this angle were indicated these being multiplied in the seconds tenths and hundredthis subtended by the radius of the signal gave the correction corresponding to the ob served angle This operation was of course of sufficient accuracy and much shorter than the calculation either by natural cosines of the half angles or their logarithms Operating in the same manner for both signals between which the angle is to be corrected the total correction of the angle is obtained according to the following easy principles which will be evident without demonstration fromn a mere inspection of the figure 1 When the sun is seen between the two signals the sum of the two corrections is added to the angle 2 When the stun is behind the station a in the vertical angle of the signals as in hak the sum of the two correc tions is to be subtracted from the angle314 SURVEY OF THE COAST 3 In all other positions of the sun with respect to the two signals the difference of the two corrections must be subtracted from the angle The angle between the sun and the signal determining the angle at the centre of the signal between the station anid the reflecting point and being bisected it is evident thiat the ac curacy obtained by thle method described is fully adequate Whlen the sun does not shine and the state of the atmnos phere is such as to affect no reflecting point whiclh will lhap pen in dull and cloudy weather the whole signals will ap pear like a white surface and in full size and accordingly if its centre be observed no reduction will be requisite The state in which the signals are seen is therefore one of the necessary remarks to be inserted in the journaal Trlhe system of wires in the telescope is to be adapted to the form of the signals in the same manner in wlich thie wire arrangement in the microscope is adapted to the kind of division of the limasb In this instrument the division be ing by lines the wire arranigement in the microscope is that of wires crossing each otlher under an angle of about thirty degrees which in placing it by the micrometer upon the di vision will present this angle bisected and enable us to judge accurately of the coincidence With a similar view I suppose Mr Ramsden applied this arrangement to the telescope of General Roys theodolite in the English survey where staffs were used as signals while the division of the instrurment being with points the micro meter wires were simple perpendicular wires  For my signals therefore the perpendicular wires were best adapted and as they were fine and exceedingly well defined cobwebs they showed the liglht of the reflected point of the signal on both sides by the irradiation whiiclh of course afforded a very nice pointino far preferable to the contact on the side of the wire which has sometimes been substi tuted for the bisection by the middle I shall add one remark moreOF THE UNITED STATES 315 A n attentive observer will find the object pointed at al ways disappearing when very near the wire and as if it were broken off In like manner in pointing with the crossing wires upon a signal presenting a point it will be impossible to place it actually in the vertex of the angle of intersection and it will become visible only at a certain distance stand ing free between the wires without admitting actual contact with the wires themselves Jidditions made to the Repeating Circle with two Telescopes The general principles and construction of this instrument are well known from the descriptions given by French wri ters on the subject rhe peculiar construction adlopted by Mr Trouahton is described in the English Encyclopedias I slhall therefore suppose such construction known and de scribe only the peculiarities of the two circles which Mr Troughton nmade for nme In the usuial construction of this instrunment when an ob servation is to be renewed for the sake of repetition the front telescope learing the verniers is to be moved no trace of the foregoing observations is left their value in some mea sure is concealed by the position of the back telescope or level In celestial observations clouds or intervening cir cumstances in general which occur so frequently in ohser vations may at this moment render all previous attention and care useless and the observer feels always somewhat anxious on that account It is lhowever evident that the successive steps of the level or back telescope measure the angle in the same mlanner as those of the front telescope Upon this consideration I founded a construction by which the instruument gives two separate scries of angles upon the same division from the316 SURVEY OF THE COAST same observations by adding only one observation more at the end and if accident should occasion the loss of one se ries the other may be preserved Plate VIJ fig 1 is a general view of the instrument from behinid where the additions made to it are all visible Fig 2 represents a section of the limb and two readings in the di rection of a radius The limb of the circle consists of two circular rings fixed to each other as seen in the second figure A section of this limb or of the witngs which form it resembles letter 1T To the lower ring the radii r of the frame of the circles are fastened the upper one being the divided limb itself which is sufficiently elevated above the radii to give passage to the clamping piece D of the front telescope The verniers of the front telescope which are four as usual reach to the division of the limb from the inside To the back telescope and level a frame exactly sinmilar to that of the front telescope is adapted with four verniers W X Y R which are fastened to the part of this frame extending beyond the circle by two pillars bringing them round the linmb outside to reachl to the division of thie limb so that there remains a sufficient space of the division free between two verniers to read them accurately when two such verniers stand opposite each other This space is about lhalf the length of the strokes The verniers then pass by each other freely and are read upon the same divi sion The two magnifiers which revolve upon the centre on arms in the front of the circle as seen in b fig i serve equally for botlh series of readings As to the divisions the strokes denoting degrees and half degrees are drawn out on both sides equally so that they show equally for botlh the inner and the outer verniers The degrees have points in the middle of the strokes which will show when two ver niers are opposite and will serve to couint thenm fromi the number seen on the left beyond the alhidade Every ten degrees being engraved outside and every five inside of the division there is always a clear and equal reading for both positions of the verniers0F THE UNITED STATES 317 Th5e verniers aire all of double length lhaving on each side of the usual vernier one half lengtlh of vernier ovei by which mneans two readings are obtained A mean of these read ings can be taken in case of any difference rUhe whole framing of the instrumnents is in general strong er in every respect than they were nmade before and parti cular attention is paid to the stability of all the adjustmnents as may be observed from a mere comparison of this figure withl those in the Encyclopedia rFhe breadth of thle ring to which the radii of the instru miieiit are fastened being about one inch the distanice at wlhichi the verniers W X 4c of the back alhidade mnust be sup plorted by it would twist this alliidade by tlheir weiglht which would occasion therm to read differently in different positions of the circle as they would in all cases sink This is avoid ed bv adding on the side opposite to the vernier the nobs a a formning a counterpoise to the verniers and effecting tlhereby their verticalitv in all positions To give more stability to the vertical or any inclined po sition of the circle there are two semicircles k k fastened to the lhorizontal axis q round which the circle is moved close to the uprights supporting this axis at bothi ends to which they are clamped by two screws 1 1 instead of only one as in the former construction There is also a small ball s upon the socket of the axis of the circle between the coun terpoise and the clamping arrangement u of the circle ad justable by a sliding piece in the small upright t which re ceives one of the axes of this level The level swings on an axis to serve in both opposite positions in which the cir cle may be placed by revolving upon the semicircles It appears to me that in all instruments the alhidades should be clamped on a separate arm not bearincg any read ing when these are not upon a full circle because the clamp is very apt to affect the reading to which it is adapt ed For this reasoni thie clamp and tangent screw of the back alhiidade is put to the separate arm n perpendicular to VOL ITT 2318 SURVEY OF THE COAST the telescope and level and the reading arms are all left to their niatural spring By this arrangement also the assis tant wlho sets the level during the observation acting in a more convenient position is less liable to affect the position of the instrument by the weiglht of his hands and there be ing nmilled heads at both ends of the tangent screw as in all otlhers of the sanme kind he can act with great steadiness by applving botlh hands The good quality and power of the telescopes is a desir able r equisite in the observations  for it will be found that a great magnifying power facilitates all the observations Tlhere fore though the circles are eighteen inches the telescopes are twentytwo inches which the inistrument bears very well and I found that a power of about sixtysix tinmes was the most advantareous for use The object ends have light lengthiening tubes of about three inches adapted instead of the covers and equilibrating the telescopes The front telescope has three horizontal and three vertical cobweb threads in the focus Trhe back telescope has only two crossing each other at right angles The four readings of the front telescope are marked in the order of the divisions by the letters D E F G which serve to register them properly in the journals of observations in the same mnanner as those of the back telescope are repre sented by W X Y Z As a very great convenience for night observations Mr Troughton usually adds to his circles a smaller divided cir cle fixed to the part bearing the level and to the telescope he adds ani arm reaching over the frame of the instrument to this circle Sliding pieces are adapted to this circle and being adjusted to the proper zenith distance of the star on both sides of the zenith will arrest the telescope itn such a situation as to bring the star in the field of the telescope by the horizontal revolution of the instrument This arrange ment underwent a slightmodification on account of the in terruption which a long arm from the front telescope would have met with from the back alhidadeOF THE UNITED STATES 3 1 9 An arm f similar to that for the clamp rises perpendicu lar to the level from the centre piece of the back alhidade to the circumference There it bends over to d and lhas a circular ring fastened to it going round the circumference and forming a complete semnicircle ddd which is again fas tened near both ends to two knees v extending from the level franme lThsis semicircle is divided upon the flat outer part like the moveable quadrant of a globe Upon this ring snmall pieces e e slide by means of springs on their inner part and present their projecting part to a small armn g adapt ed to the front telescope by which this is stopped upon the proper zenith distance to which the stops e e have been placed This piece g should be a very light piece of brass made to spring or give way when it comes in contact with the stops  so that it could not affect the position of the tele scope in coming accidentally in contact The motion of the horizontal axis of the circle is stopped by the screw u which presses to this axis an arrangement similar to the stop of a windmill and the smnall motions are miade by the screw at m at the end of two arms one of which is fast to this arrangement and the other to the cenitre piece of the horizontal axis q To make this motion easy the screw at m consists of two parts of unequal threads or paths each going in the nut of its respective arm and there by causing the motion of the circle itself to arise only from the difference of the two screws This motion is therefore as small as that arising from any other tangent screw on the instrunment and the use of thie screws in the legs of the in strunment can be fully dispensed witlh in this respect The horizontal circle of the instrument is fixed to the co nical radii which formii at the same time the legs of it Trhe clamping and three readings A B C are adapted to the co lumn forming the socket of the vertical axis of the instru ment A mllagnifier revolving rounid the lowermost part of the column serves equally for all three readings To stop the lhorizontal motion of the upper circle in the proper situation in respect to the azimuth when stars are E6320 SURVEY OF THE COAST observed at night two small stops n n are placed on the limnb of the horizontal circle and are fastened to it by a spring beneatlh it and presenting their projectinig parts on the limib to the sides of tlhe alhidade A in the two positions of thie circle in which the star is met by a vertical plane pass ing through it Instead of the arrangement formerly used to produce a small vertical motion in the legs of the instrumrent the screws are here again constructed on the same principles of two screws working in eacth other exactly equal in all respects to those described in the twofeet theodolite On some Adjustnments of the Repeating Circle It will not be expected that I should give here a full de scription of the adjustment of this instrument it is too easy and too well known But I have no where seen mentioned the most proper mode of placing the circle accurately in thie plane of the vertical and of verifying the parallelism of the two motions of the circle and the telescope This consists in observing the pole star best in its great est digression both directly and by reflection from a mercu rial horizon I do it in the following manner whenever any more nicety is desired than can be expected from the mere placing of the two semicircles kk to the coincidence of certain strokes made upon them at so withi the sides of the supports of the horizontal axis q Having carefully levelled the horizontal motion of the in strument by the large level on the circle so that the verti cality should take place by the above adjustinent the tele scope is pointed to the pole star and the horizontal motion clamped Then reading the approximiate altitude or zeniith distance the telescope is lowered so much below the horizonOF THE UNITED STATES 321 as to receive its reflection from the artificial lhorizon whiclh is now placed in the situation indicated by the telescope and slielterel firom vacillation if necessary from the wind by a glass cap If the motion of the telescope is exactly vertical the re flected star in the mercury will coincide with the sanme ver tical wire wlich was Iointed uipon the star viewed directly if not it must be corrected half by moving the plane of the circle round upon the axis q after unclamping the screws 1 1 and half by the tangent screw on the horizontal circle If the circle is moved in the vertical with the telescope clamped and every thing arranged as in the above observa tion the verticality of its motion will be ascertained If there fore there is any doubt respecting the parallelism of the circle and the telescope it will be best to begin first by making the observation with the circle the telescope being clamped and whlen this is adjusted to adljulst the wires accordingly When these adjustments are mlade and before any clhatnge in the level of the instrument takes place the level s on the axis must he adjtusted and it will tthen serve to verify the ver ticality of the circle as long as this circle is kept in its place I therefore had the packinig boxes so constructed that the instrunment might be removed without takingr it apart as I observed tlhat the separate packing of the circle with the great counterpoise subjected the instrument to injury I think that some mechanical arrangement might be easily and advantaoeoujsly adopted for the purpose of giving to this adjustment a still greater degree of accuracy The illumination of the readings must be carefully attend etd to as at night they are very difficult and tlhereby become unicertain I applied here also with the best success paper reflectors folding a quarto sheet exactly as described for the twofeet theodolite but instead of giving it a fold to bend it at right angles I cut from about threequarters of an inch behind the circular hole which is here made so as to fit the tube of the magnifier a slit to admit the arm of this magnifier about two inches and a half long and abotit822 SURVEY OF THE COAST half an inch farther another short slit at right angles to the former By these the paper was slided and held upon the arm of the magnifier and screwed to it along with its tube Holding a light on the opposite side of the circle properly the light will be reflected very well on the divisions and give a very good reading During the day the free light will have the same effect It is useful to know exactly the angular distances of the wires in the telescope and the values of the divisions of the level The first are very easily determined by pointing upon a well defined object with the different wires and read ing the verniers The last are equally easy to determine in these instruments having readings to the level motion by placing the level on all divisions successively and reading all four verniers It is proper to repeat these observations when made as the determination has regard to a very small quantity Methods for this purpose will easily suggest them selves to a skilful observer and a very good use mnay be mnade of the results when accidents have disturbed the usual regularity of an observation Still I do not approve of a method suggested sometimes viz reading the level though not fully adjusted and keeping account of its standing at each observation In one of these circles the intervals of the wires were 8 053 in the arc and ten snmall divisions of the level sub 2775 Methods of observing a Series of Vertical Aingles uith the Re peating Circle The instrument being well adjusted and levelled by ineans of the large level of the circle I place the froint telescope before the observation upon any convenient point of the cirOF THE UNITED STATES 323 cle and read its four verniers D E F G taking a meani be tween the readings within and without their nominial when any difference appears or I read thenm in their accidental position which may be that of the last preceding obser vation Thlese readings are written in the third fourth fifth arid sixth columns ot the DayBook In the second colunmn the first letter of the series of readings is written and the first column is left for the times In a night observation the stops e e are placed to their proper zenith distance allowing some free space for the quar ter zenith distance of the star out of the meridian and to avoid touching in pointing the telescope The alhidade with the levels is moved so as to bring them near the projecting g of the front telescope taking care to avoid actual contact rhe circle is now turned so as to bring the level into an hio rizontal position By the horizontal revolution of the circle the star will now appear in the field of the telescope and when found the horizontal stop r fitting to the side on which the circle is is placed in contact with the alhilade A Then the observer will make thte accurate pointing upon the star or object by the motion of the screw m wlichl guides the whiole circle while the assistant observer will adjust the level by its proper screw at the artn h When both these are right together the time is marked in seconds and deci mals from a time piece by a second assistant acting as a se cretary The timne is written in the first column of the Day Book before the readings of the front telescope and forms the first time for the series of angles of the front telescope By the placing of the level the verniers WV X Y Z come into their first position for the series of the level or back te lescope These fotir verniers are therefore now read off and their readings written below the others in the same or der being marked in the second colunn by the letter W The circle leing now biought on the olher side of the co lumn by a half revolution on the vertical axis the observer324 SURVEY OF THE COAST will nmove the front telescope near the other stol e and make the second observation pointing by the tangent screw of this telescope on the artn D while the assistant will adjust the level if it should be necessary by the circle screw at mr though this adjustment will be very slighlt if any wlhen the circle is well adjusted Trhe time of the simultaneous coincidence of the pointing and adjustment of the levels is again noted by tlhe secretary and writtein in the first columin before the readingcs W 5c constituting tle first time of the series of angles with thie back alhidade Before turning the circle off the observer will take care to place the other lhorizontal stop n to the conitact with the alhidade A from thiis second position From this the circle will be placed again in the first posi tion and the observations conitinued regularly and in the same order exactly to the last of the series which must be like the first an observation in wlhich the level is placed by its own screw at h so that the whole series consists of an odd number of observations The series being tlhus closed all verniers of both sets are read off those of the front telescope are written opposite to the time before the last and those of the back alhidade to the last time prefixing again in the second columni the first letters of the set of readings All these will be observed in their regular order in the corresponding examples of the DayBook By one observation more than is usual in the other circles these give therefore two complete equal and so far as re fers to readings independent series of observations To that of the front telescope belong all the tinmes thie last ex cepted and to that of the back allhidade all the times except the first They form a check upon eachi other against nmis takes or errors arnd may in somie nmeasure serve as a test of the proportional accuracy of different series of observations besides that all results are evidently doubled The convenience obtained by the use of the screw m forOF THE UNITED STATES 325 the circle is such as to make the use of the screws at the legs for tihis purpose actually objectionable as it brings the instrument out of its vertical and occasions always a tedious adjustment of the level besides thiat wlhen a number of ob servations are to be made consecutively it would be neces sary to level the whole instrument again after every one wlhile otherwise the circle once well adjusted wvill remain so for as mnany observations as may be niade in a whole night if proper care has been taken as to the solidity of the stand whiclh in the field must always be placed on three plugs reaching deep into the ground It is evident that the measurement of a series of anigles in the plane of two objects may be conducted in respect to the successive motions of the fronit and back telescope exactly as has been described above and the results taken in the same manner As two opposite readings correct the eccentricity if any it is evident that the indiscritninate mean of any two opposite readings should always be equal but the different sinkings of the readings and the different influence of the weight of the telescope and otler moveable parts of thie instrument may introduce differences as is well known and sufficienitly discussed therefore the indiscriminate mean of all four read ings is also here to be preferred and will ultimately be found to give a better result than a discrimination would give rhe DayBook examples will show in their places how I pro ceeded in this Xrespect to scrtutinise the results of rmjy obser vations It is well known that this instrument is calculated to cor rect all its own errors by the effect of its repeating property and construction particularly in the vertical angles Still it is well known that for instance in determinations of lati tude it is proper to take thle indiscriminate mean of an equal number of results of observations from the north and the south side of the zenitlh For the same reason if ever any doubt should exist as to the want of stability in the parts of the instrument which VOL I1U 2326 SURVEY OF THE COAST is very possible the circle should be used in the two invert ed positions which the semicircles admit Peculiar Method of Observinig Time with the Repeating Circle In the observations for the determination of time this ele ment itself is the principal object of research and mnay be considered as the most difficult to obtain accurate The pro per adjustmnent of the level in an observation of such a tranr sitory nature and during which the circle may move con siderably in the vertical by pointing requires great dexterity in the assistant anid since the level itself oscillates in passing to equilibrium it is often very difficult to be sure of its po sition From one complete observation with the circle in its two positions and the indiscriminate mean of the four readings all the main corrections of the observation are obtained Suic ceeding observations serve only to augmenit the probability of accuracy anid to correct accidental errors of division which as already stated may be considered a minimum in the instruments of Mr Troughton A method satisfying the two first mentioned desiderata will therefore secure more accuracy in this kind of observa tiofl than the usual mode of repeating My peculiar situa tion with assistants entirely unacquainted with observations joined to these considerations led me to devise the follow ing method of observing time which I have ever since prac tised and which Dr Tiarks the British astronomer for the boundary line at Canada adopted also in our common works there Trhe instrument being well levelled and the position of the front telescope read oft as usual the circle is placed so asOF THE UNITED STATES 327 to receive the transit of the star or both limbs of the sun at all the horizontal wires In this situation the level is adjust ed with ease sufficient time being given by the placing of the circle and the transit of the star or both limnbs of the sun at eachi of the three wires is observed This can be done with the greatest nicety the instrument being at rest and all the observers attention being directed to the timne of contact which is rapid the observer calling out JVull at each transit the secretary being attentive to the chronometer or clock can note the time with the greatest accuracy and the transit of the suns centre is determined by six observa tions The circle being now brought Pnto its second positionl by a semirevolution on its vertical axis the level will remain adjusted if the instrument is well levelled If it require any correction this nmust be made by the circle screw mi as the positioni of the level upon the circle must be preserved TIhe telescope is then unclamped at D and again placed so as to receive the transits as before Thlese are observed and the time noted as lhas been done in the first positioni Trlhis observation being made the verniers of the firont te lescope are again read and give thle double zenith distance or rather the sum of thie two zenith distances at the times of the observed transits The half of this sum is to be consi dered as corresponding to the mean time between the two transits Such an observation when taken near the prime vertical will not exceed the tirne allowed for taking an arithmetical mean and will be the result of six or twelve observations of time If the transit of the sun is supposed to take too much time to observe botlh limbs on each side the antecedent may be taken in the first position and the consequent in thie second There being then but half the number of times obtained the observation may be repeated after the readinig and a mean of two such observations taken as in any other case calcu lating each separate 2328 SURVEY OP THE COAST In all cases the application of Mr SoIdners method of reducing all observations to the mean time by correcting the result for their respective distances from thie same applies here with great ease and accuracy since for each transit the distances of the wires are equal on eaclh side as nearly as the distances of the wires are and therefore thie caleculation of this correction may be made for half their number only It will therefore always be found advantageous to apply this method in the calculation of the results Trhis method of observing will be found very satisfactory in practice in regard to accuracy and a saving of timiie toge ther with the facility of choosing it so as to come nearest the prime vertical This method will admit an observation of time to be taken among flying clouds when the method by repetition would be inapplicable and when no complete observation can be obtained the observation of any pair of corresponding wires in both positions of the circle will at least give an approxi mate result which will often be useful It would be very advantageous in using this method to have five horizontal wires in the telescope within a space near that occupied by the three as the transits could easily be observed and the gain for each wire would be double in thie result I have therefore sometimes applied them The registering of such an observation and the manner of taking the result will be found in their proper places in the DayBook and the Journal of Results Description of the Repeating Theodolite of One Foot Diameter Besides the great theodolite it was very desirable as well for the intenled survey of tte coast as for other uses in the country to have sonme instruments of the theodolite kind ofOF THE UNITED STATES 329 a snmaller diameter and yet capable of giving the same ac curacy as the large instruments though at the expense of nmore skill labour and time of the observer It was also desirable that thie samne instrument should equally serve for vertical angles in order to enable the observer to determine accurately latitudes times and the anigles of elevation of the signals Tthe nmultiplication of the terrestrial angles in the plane of the horizon was far preferable to that in the plane of thie ob jects on account of the great influence of refiraction near the sea shore particularly upon sandy beaches and islands where it may be considered as varying constantly and even a sav ing of time in the calculations was an object worth conside ration It was necessary on this account that the instrument should be of the repeating kind and a theodolite In planning an instrumnent to answer these views the prin ciples mentioned when treating of the twofeet theodolite and the repeating circle with two telescopes lead me to unite the properties of both these instruments omitting only the nmeans of measuring angles in inclined planes In repeating instruments the main points to ensure accu racy arethe exact and steady levelling of the instrument and the constant parallelism of the motions with respect to each other in the course of the repeated measurement of an angle These beinig secured the plane of the divided circle itself with its division serves as a mere indicatoi of the ope rations which has no influence until in the final reading of the stopping point by the amount of the reduction of thie dis tance of it from its intersection with the real horizon and by the accidental error of the division used which have been shown to be the two smallest errors rhe influence of ec centricity being corrected bv the indiscriminate mean of the three readings and the instrument admitting all the systema tic combination of the series of angles which the twofeet theodolite admits for the single angles The same principles as far as relates to the mode of mul330 SURVEY OF THE COAST tiplying and the motions of the axis could evidently be exe cuted in the vertical as well as in the horizontal circle By making the latter revolve in the manner of a transit not only all counterpoising weight might be avoided and there fore the weight of the instrument very much diminished but also its stability in the observation might be secured Upon these considerations I founded the construction of an instrument of which I presented a plan in full size to Mr Troughton who approving the principles thought hiowever at first that witlh eighteen incles diameter as I wished it it would present some difficulties and therefore executed two of them of twelve inches in diameter availing himself of the liberty left to him as a skilful and experienced artist to alter in various respects their external appearance Plate VIII fig 1 is a full perspective view of the instru ment and fig 2 is a vertical section of the horizontal circle through tthe centre The centre piece aaaa of the stand part is twothirds of a strong sphere perforated to receive the axis of the horizontal circle The tlhree hollow conical arms formingo the legs of the instrument are fastened to this piece by large strong screws which are stopped

and forms the axis of the horizontal circle whichi revolves upon it by means of the socket dd The upper part seven inches long has its diameter diminished so as to leave a collar ee of about onetenth of an inch to rest the upper part of the instrument upon lThis socket is in theOP THE UNITED STATES 331 tniddle between the two columnns g g wvIich support the axis of the upper telescope and circle

three radii in the direction of the three legs of the instrument which bear at ttheir ends the three verniers D E F with a clamp and tangent screw at D This lholds the circle dd bv its lower plane which is also that of the radii of the circle The divided limb of the circle ii is elevated above the other plane so as to leave both oni the inside and outside a recess sufficient for the clamping parts of the innier and the outer verniers Thie inner clamp and tangent sclew at A clarmpinig and leading the upper part of the instrument has the three verniers A B C reaching upon the same division of the limb ii and affording readings for both the forward and the backward nmotion of the telescope These motions are required in measuring an angle by multiplication For alternating between the two clamps at A and at D the circle will in one motion move with the upper part of the instru ment and in the other remain clamped to the stand part The reading glass is on a detached part consisting of a piece m about an inch and a half long twothirds of an inch broad and onetlhird of an inch thick bearing at one enid a small pillar upon which the projecting artn revolves This brinigs the nagnifying glass with its reflector over any vernier required At the other end a solid nob forms at the same tinme a handle and counterpoise to the magnifier The reflector is a circular plate of brass lined below witlh plaister of Paris The two columns gg rise from the strong plate 11 on botl sides of the centre so that their bases touch the base of the central cone which forms the socket of the axis They are about two inches and a half in diatneter at the base and fif teen inches ligh Each carries upon its top a solid piece yy332 SURVEY OP THE COAST which projects a little more than an inch beyond the column to bear the supports of the transit axis of the telescope The axis of the transit is nine inches long Its two parts as well as the two larts of the telescope itself are screwed in a spheric centre piece of about two inches and a half in diameter and are in all respects similar in construction to the telescope of the twofeet theodolite rhe telescope it self is nineteen inches long and of two inches and a half aper ture It has a letigthening or rather sheltering tube before the olject glass and in the focus three vertical and three hlo rizontal threads of cobweb rhe eye glasses are exactly the same as those of the twofeet theodolite and repeating cir cles so that they will serve for any of these instruments in case of loss The largest magniifying power is about for tyfive times On the side of the telescope tube opposite to the circle there are two small pins or axes which are adjustable and by receiving a level constructed for the purpose make this telescope serve as a very fine levelling instrument Througlh one side of the axis the wires in the focus are illuminated by the lantern which is placed upon a light pro jecting piece opposite to the axis and fastened to the piece y by a screw The otlher part of the axis of the telescope torms the axis of the vertical circle which revolves upon it in a manner exactly similar to that of the horizontal circle upon its axis An alhidade bearing two diametrically opposite verniers W X is fastened to the axis of the telescope by its middle circuilar part and fornms the outer reading uplon the divisions exactly as in tlle horizontal circle and clamps in like manner to the outer part of the limb A triangular piece of which one side is horizontal bears the two diamietrically opposite readings Y Z reaching upon the division from the inside and clamping to the limb of the circle by means of the inner recess between its plane and the plane of the radiiOF THE UNITED STATES 333 To the angle of this piece which is turned downwards is attaclhed a piece q which bears a steel pin fitting in a vertical slit in the bar of the triangle which prevents all angular mo tion of this piece around thie colum n In the mniddle between the two verniers of the bar of the lhorizontal triangle is the centre socket p within which the axis of the telescope revolves This socket and that of the telescope are held to the axis by the ring u which is screwed to the shoulder of thie bell metal part of the axis of the te lescope forming the axis to these two motions Thie two magnifiers which serve for all readings revolve with their airns round the socket of the triangle Thev are fixed to a ring that turns round this socket and which is held in its place by the projection of the same piece u In observing vertical angles the circle is clamped al ternately to the alhidade of the telescope or to the triangular piece by the alternate use of the clamps at X or at Z and the two series of motions give two separate series of angles each with two diametrically opposite readings All the verniers of both circles are double in this instru ment as in the repeating circle having one half vernier or eachi side The adjustment of the axis of the telescope is made by two strong screws under the pieces y y showing a capstan head at r in the uppermost plate of the column and pressing these pieces upwards by their spring around the screws s by which they are held fast to the colurnns A detached level is placed upon the ends of the axis pass ing between the radii of the circle for the final accurate levelling of the instrument When the instrument is adjusted this level is removed aand placed upon an arm t at the top of the column opposite the circle in a position parallel to the same and there adjusted by a screw below one end of the arm to serve as a constant test of the stability of tthe level of the instrument during the observation By bending the lower angular part of the triangle above VOL II X 2334 SURVEY OF THE COAST mentioned a little inwards it nmay be disengaged from the pini in the piece q which holds it in its position Then the axis of the telescope can be lifted out of its supports and the whole upper part which serves to measure vertical angles can be taken off and placed in an inverted position for the verification of the line of collimation of the telescope thlough it can not serve in this inverted position for the measurement of vertical angles The verification telescope below the instrument is exactly similar to the upper anid can if desired be used in its place It hangs in hooks x x one of which hangs fronm one of the legs and the other from an artm of the stand part of the in strument purposely intended for it It is pointed in the same manner as that of the twofeet theodolite by an ar rangement w of three sliding tubes and a screw presenting its head to the upper part of the telescope tube at the eye end which is pressed upwards to it by the overpoise of thie oIject end To ease the first approximate levelling of the instrument there are two small levels k k about two inches and a half long and half an inch in diameter placed at right angles to each other at the side of the socket of the axis between the two columns on the side opposite to the vernier marked A which in the figure show only a little between the axis and the columns The elevation of the upper telescope above the horizontal circle increases the facility of observing very high altitudes The eye end passes through the nadir above the piece J crossing the top of the vertical axis The whole instrument is about thirtytwo inches high and the base of it throughll the truncated cones is a circle of about nineteen inches in diameter It is therefore well proportioned for stability par ticularly as the upper parts are not heavy In my original plan several of the arrangements were dif ferent rhey were executed with great success in another instrument and every artist or practical experienced o server will of course vary the disposition of many of the partsOF THE UNITED STATES 33 according to his own conveniience and experience and also according to the particular skill or means of the artist who constructs the instrument The high opinion which I had reason to entertain of so distinguished ani artist as Mr Troughton induced me to leave much to his judgment and ideas I had the horizotntal circle constructed so as to have the axes of both motions The centre part had cones both downwardts and upwards The axis downwards revolved in the centre of the stand part The legs of this were in clinied from the centre to the circumference where the per pendicular screws come and upon which the instrument stanids The other axis receives the upper part of the in strument by means of a socket similar to that in the other instrunment but much shorter Trhese two axes were of bell metal with steel rings at their inner and outer ends They were differently proportioned to each other The lower was about twice as long as the upper and of a more acute conical shape in order to give it a greater wedging power which with the greater superin cumbent weight on it when the circle is moved with the up per part increased its friction The upper axis was about two inches long its lower diameter was about the same length its upper less than one inch The socket of the axis lay close to it and moved witlh ease as the weight of the upper part was light Accordingly in moving this part the great weight of the horizontal circle and its great friction prevented all dragging of it after this motion This in the instruments made by Mr TRroughton and in whicth the ho rizontal circle is light is prevented by completely detaching the circle from thie upper part when the clamp A is loose Mr Troughtons objection to this shape of the axes was that they could not be rubbed so well with emery in a kind of screwing motion which takes off all the rings of turning and renders them smooth But as these rings always form themselves in the instrument by use I should think that in336 SURVEY OF THE COAST vertical axes there is no bad influence to be apprehended from them The vertical circle being supported in this kind of instru ments between two columiins it is subject to less spring and has much more stability than in the circle with two tele scopes where the double weight of the circle hangs upon a short axis upon whichi equllibrium is mnaijntained between the circle and its counterpoise The verification of the verticality by the pole star can be made with tlhe greatest nicety and the large detached level itself can be adjusted upon it Method of Observing Horizontal Angles with the Repeatizlg Theodolite The adjustments of this instrument are evidently the same as those of the twofeet theodolite and grounded upon sitn ple and well known principles which are self evident from a view of the instrument and need therefore not to be ex plained here The use of common theodolites witlh double axes for the repetition of angles is also so well known that the mere de scription and view of the instrurneint would lead to the use of these double repeating theodolites yet it may be proper to describe here the mode of taking a regular series in or der to render maore intelligible the other pecularities wlicl are to be mnentioned as means leading to the greatest accu racy When the instrument is carefully levelled the riding level is placed upon the arm t parallel to the vertical circle and there adjusted Then the vernier A being placed upon 00 or any other di vision which may also be the last reading of a foregoing seOF THE UNITED STATES 337 ries the stands of the veriniers A B C are inserted in the Journial The clanmp D being loose thie telescope part to getlhert with the circle will be turned so as to point the tele scope upon the object to the left of the observer and the pointing made by the tangent screw at D After whicl the three verniers D E F are r ead off and inserted in tthe Jour nal It is best to write tlhetn consecutivelv in the six first columns of the journal heading eachi with its proper letter the superscription of the angle to be measured being gene ral and above all the letters with any requisite remark or designation of the signal 5c Trhen the clamp at A being opened thie upper part of the instrument without the circle is turned towards the object to the riglht of the observer and being pointed by the tangtent screw of the same the first angle of the series of the three verniers A B C may be read After this the clamp at D being opened and the telescope part together witlh the circle being turned back upon the object to the left and pointed by the tangent screw at D the first angle of the series of D E F will be obtained In this manner will the observations be continued through as mnany repetitions as mnay be desired paving attention to conclude with the same kind of movement witlh which the observation has commenced in order to give to both series the sanme number of angles In order to keep some account of the progression of the angles it is also proper to read one veruiier for instance A and D at each obser vation and insert the readings in their proper place in the DayvBook From the order of progressing here indicated the angles will successively follow the order of thle divisions If nmore series are observed it may be proper to take the seconid se ries in an inverse order or backwards on the divisions as the influence of pressures of screws or friction ec would act inversely and the indiscriminate mean correct them as far as possible It is also evident that if the greatest accuracy be aimed at338 SURVEY OF TIlE COAST it is advisable to take two series like the simple angles in the twofeet theodolite with the telescope in a direct and in a reversed position in order to compensate the influence of the verticality of the telescope though near the horizon this influence is very small In like manner also the instrlument may be placed in the three possible positions of thje legs upon their conies and suclh series may be taken at each po sition All these changes would undoubtedly contribute to accu racy by the comnpensation which they would give to the in discriminate mean of the proper number of series It miglht be asserted that these changes with series of only a smaller number of angles would be preferable to long series in one position What has been said upon this subject relative to the two feet theodolite refers evidently to this instrurment as it is grounded upon the same principles the multiplication of the angles excepted which in usinig it according to such a sys tem would be considered merely as a compensation for the greater diameter of the instrument I shall not enter lhere into further details on this subject as I never lhad time or op portunity to test these inistruments completely I measured only some angles by way of trial the coincidence of which with those of the twofeet theodolite was very satisfactory Method of Observing Vertical Angles with the Repeating Theodolite When the instrument has been carefully adjusted and level led in all respects the observation of a series of zenith dis tances with it is taken nearly in the same manner as with the repeating circle but in respect to its order in the use of theOF THE UNITED STATES 339 clamps it admits two different stuccessions differing only ill the ease with which the screws come to the hand in each notion The observation can evidently be made by one person alone as the level requiires no particular attendance It may lhowever be observed firom time to time to be sure that the instrument has not been disturbed The following order will bring the screws so as to be al ways convenient to the hand of the observer i Place the vernier Z on o or any division and read Z and Y These readings are written in the third and fourth columns of the DayBook 2 Ihe clamp at X being loose make the first observation by the motion of the telescope alone and point bv means of the tangent screw of the same vernier Z When the object observed is a celestial body the time of this observation is observed and written before the readings of Z and Y in the first column of the DavBook 3 Then W and X are read off and written in thie fiftl and sixtlh columns of the DayBook one line farther down than the Z and Y lhave been written 4 Unclamp the circle at Z turn the upper part of the in strument one half a circumference round horizontally and the telescope together with the circle through the zenithi again to the object to be observed upon which the clamp at Z being again fastened the pointing is effected by the tan gent screw of the same Z and the timne observed is written in the first column opposite to the foregoing readings By this the first angle of the series by Z will be obtained a Turning the instrument a semicircumference horizon tally and after unclamping the vernier X also the telescope alone without the circle through the zenith to the object to be observed the pointing is again performed by the tangent screw of the sanme vernier X whereby the first angle of the second series or by W X is obtained andthe time observed is written again in the first columln 6 The observer may proceed in this order and in the340 SURVEY Of THE COAST same manner as with the repeating circle by a succession of the above alternating motions until the desired series is ob tained endling at last with the same motion with which the series was begun as here by a pointing with the tangent screw at X 7 All the times of such a series except the last will be long to the series of Z and Y and all times excepting thie first to the series of the reading W X If several series of the same zenith distance of a terrestrial object should be desired for the sake of great accuracy it would be advisable to take these series in the two different manners whiclh the instrument admits anid to use the indis criminate nmean in preference to either The manner of taking out the results of such a series of observations and of calculating them is of course exactly the same as in the repeating circle with two telescopes and the mode of registering the observations and the results in thie daybooks and journals may therefore be omitted lhere as sufficiently obvious It is evident that the method of observing time described in the repeating circle applies also to this inistrurment witl equal advantage and ease Besides this the ease with which the light vertical circle or the telescope alone moves upon the ttansit axis affords in the present case another methodviz to measure dou ble altitudes by reflection on a mercury horizon the level showing the stability of the instrument which for this kind of observation needs no inversion or movement in azimuth except for the small progress of the celestial body during the observation By alternating the motions of the transit with and without the circle between the direct object and its image in the mercury horizon a series of observations of double altitudes may be obtained with great celerity and if the sun should be the object the limbs may be alternated as in another ob servation The titnes of the two series will follow exactly as in the series for the zenith distances and all other direcOF THE UNITED STATES 34 t tions given for these apply equally to the series of double altitudes An observer with a little experience will be able to make suchi an observation without further direction All that is desirable for it is a large mercury horizon in order to have no need of moving it during the observation It is easy to  adapt to this instrument a stopping arrange ment for finding stars by night These may be very light and removeable when not needed On this occasion I may remark that it is proper to make the touches of these stops light springs and not solid parts that in case they should come to touch the telescope or other part of the in strument stopped may not be affected by it Description of the Repeating Circle of Reflection The application of the principle of reflection from plane mnirrors has produced the instrument whichl has most con tributed to the advancement of nautical astronomy and geo graphly When the mirrors are perfect the accuracy which may be obtained in the measurement of vertical angles observed by mneans of the mercurial horizon is certainly far superior to that from any other instrunmenit of equal size in which the level or plumb line is used the circumstances in all other respects being the same The use of a circle instead of a sextant or octant intro duced by Tobias Meyer has in this as in all other instru inents freed the results from the influence of eccentricity and the improvements of it by Borda have furnished the means of correcting the errors of the glasses and adding the property of repetition In miiultiplying instruments the constant parallelism of the TOL II Y 2342 SURVEY OP THE COAST motions is one of the principal properties required as stated before Tlhis is evideintly to be applied in this instrument to the plane of reflection which is itself determined by the posi tion of the large mirror In Bordas construction the axis upon which the mirror revolves being short the plane of reflection is too much guided by the plane of the limb which artists well know can not be executed with the same accuracy and ease as the axis From this cause the English artists abandoned the principle of repetition and Mr Trouglhton gave to the circle a construction in which the motion of the mirror is determined by a longer axis and the eccentricity corrected by three readings without repeating which from the excel lence of his work and his great care in the choice of the mir rors has given most excellenit results Reflecting instruments being indispensable in the survey of the coast for the observations to determine soundings and others to be made on board of vessels 5c I consider ed it proper again to turn my thoughts to the improvement of this instrument as I had done lonig before so as to pre serve both the multiplying principle and the stability of the planie of reflection I considered the circle itself as of mi nor influence and therefore allowed it to be moveable and alternately clamped to the solid part of the instrument which bears the small mirror and the telescope or to the alhidade of the large mirror and moving with it Having made a description of such an instrument with a drawing of full size before I left the country I presented it to Mr Troughton who said immediately that he would nmake me one upon the same principles though different in shape as he wished the instrument to be lighter He showed mne at the same time the ideas of Mr Mendoza which had com pletely failed in a similar attermpt and of which I then ob tained the first information Mr Troughton gave to the instrument a shape similar to that of his reflecting circle from which my drawing differedOF THE UNITED STATES 343 in many respects but here I had the reason as in the other instruments to leave him at full liberty in this respect I may therefore be allowed htere again to suppose the con struction of Mr Troughtons reflecting circle fully known and describe only the alterations made to it to give it the repeating property Plate IX fig 1 is a perspective view and fig 10 a sectioni of the centre part of the instrument The parts a b c d e form the frame of the instrument which containis in the ceni tre piece e the axis both of the mirror and the circle in a the support of thie telescope which may be lowered or ele vated for the equalisation of the illumination of the two ob jects in the same nmanner as in Mr Troughtons circle in c the small nmirror is fixed exactly in the same manner as are also the handlesff and the rectangular piece g reaching over the large mirror to receive the straight handle but the framre reaches only so far as to unite all the above parts The circle itself revolves on the side of the frame oppo site to the mirror by a bell metal socket t t of hialf an inch in length upon an axis turned to the brass centre piece e of the frame through the middle of wlhich the axis of the great mirror s s passes as far as the upper part whiere the mirror is fastened to it The alhidade AB of the great mirror is at the end of the axis opposite to it and revolves upon the circle so as to read upon the divisions The alhidade DC is fixed to the frame of the instrument between it and the circle and forms two diametricallv op posite readings upon the circle for the motion of the mirror and the circle together The two axes have therefore entirely independent revolu tions the mirror within and the circle without the piece u u The clamps of the two motions are here both outside of the circle as it is not necessary that they cross each other in the observation Both alhidades will give a separate series of angles corrected for eccentricity by the two opposite read ings344 SURVEY OP THE COAST Wheni the mirrors are parallel the alhidade AB stands un der the telescope and the alhidade DC is at right angles with it so that in the observations the vernier A comes alternate ly on the two sides of the telescope The angle between the collimation line of the telescope and that fronm the cen tre to the small mirror form an angle of about 170 at the small mirror IThe direction of the handles ff is perpendi cular to the collimation line of the telescope As all angles are measured at least double namely on both sides of the parallelisms the circle is divided like every other into 3600 To give to the great mirror the full field of reflectiotn on the side of the telescope when large angles are measured the telescope is not screwed fast in the support at n but tle part conmmonly made to adjust the collimation line parallel to the plane of reflection is here extended into a tube m about four inches long in which the telescope is slided in and out according to what the angle may admit and to keep the cir cle not farther from the eye than necessary On account of the ease of holding it the screw I in the te lescope tube slides in the slit of this tube to prevent it from turning and thereby altering the direction of the collimation line towards the plane of reflection The different eye pieces are fitted in a separate tube which unscrews at p for the ease of packing To give to this instrument the same advantage in finding stars by night as the circles of eighteen inches have there is a light divided semicircle o o adapted to the alhidade DC supported in the middle by a small piece reaclhing to the telescope a Upon this two sliding pieces q q are placed on both sides of the middle to the proper double altitude of the star and the light pieces r r fastened to the other alhidade at A will be arrested by them whether this alhidade moves alone or with the circle lThe other parts of the instrument being exactly similar to Mr Troughtons circle need not here be mentioned It is also evident that the construction and shape of this instruOF THE UNITED STATES 345 ment may be varied in different manners without altering its principal qualities I made various plans but it would be needless to state here their varieties Method of Observing with the Repeating Reflecting Circle The adjustments of this instrument being of course in eve ry respect the same as the well known adjustments of any reflecting instrument must not be repeated here In all re peating instruments attention is required to avoid mistak ing in the regular course of alternating observations and use of clamps and screws It is therefore necessary to proceed at first with measured and cautious steps and to form a re gular habit of an order easy in the manipulation which when it becomnes habitual will always proceed more surely and rapidly The examples of observations given in the exem plar of the DayBook and Journal will prove that two series of ten altitudes may be taken in the space of five or six mi nutes The correspondence of observations with this instrument and others withi the eiglhteen inch repeating circle which I had an opportunity of making at the northern boundary line proved that the former was capable of giving an accuracy nearly as great as the latter The most convenient order of proceeding in a repeated double series of observations is the following i Place the vernier A upon o0 or any desired or round number and read off B 2 Write these readings in the third and fourth columns of the DayBook Vide Exetnplar 3 The alhidade DC beinig unclamped make an observa tion by the motion of the mirror and circle together the con346 SURVEY OF THE COAST tact being made by the tangent screw at C when this has been clamped The time of this observation is written in the first column before the readings of A and B 4 Read the verniers C D and write the resuilt in the fifth and sixth colunlls of the DayBook one line lower down than the foregoing 5 If a night observation place the stop q on the light cir cle near the outside of the projecting piece r of the alhidade A leaving it sonme freedom of motion and the other piece q upon the opposite side of the parallelism upon the same nunmber of degrees 4e 6 Invert the instrunment either fronm right to left when in a vertical observation or upside down in otherpositions and unclamping the alhidade of A 6 B nmove it up to the opposite stop on the small circle or in general near the place whichi will be indicated by the reading on the snmall circle and after clamping tlhere make again an observation bring ing the objects in contact by the tangent screw at A 7 The tinie corresponding to this observationi being ob served it is written in the first column below the former timie and opposite to the second reading 8 If the stand of the alhidade of A e B is now read off a result is obtained of the first angle of this series to wlhich the two tinmes observed would correspond and in a vertical observation on tthe mercury horizon the angle indicated would be the double altitude corresponding to the mean of the two tirnes 9 Invert the instrument again to bring it in the same po sition as for the first observation unclamp the alhidade C D and nmove the circle with the large rnirror the alhidade of wtichl remains clamped to it near to the first position or place of the stop where C is again clamped 10 In this position make again an ohservation effecting the contact by the tangent screw at C and writing the timne under the second tinme i  In reading the verniers C 4 D the first anigle of theOF THE UNITED STATES 347 series would be obtained giving again directly the double altitude corresponding to the nmean of two last times if the observation is a vertical one on a mercury horizon 12 To continue the series farther the next operation will be the moving of the albidade A or the mirror alone as in No 6 and the alternation may be continued as far as de sired the last observation being always one of the samie kind as that first nmade in order to give to both series the same number of angles 13 The times belonging to the first series A 4 B will be all thie times observed except the last and the times of the series C 8 D all the times except the first as in the repeating circle with two telescopes and the calculation of each series will be separate If the angle observed should increase during the observa tion as in observing time for instance it will be proper to attend occasionally to the stops that they may not be too near so as to occasion themii to be touched by the alhidade and disturb the readings In observing the sun these stops are best removed to the end of the circle In keeping fast the clamp of the alhidade C which holds the circle and moving only the mirror the instrument will perform exactly the same functions as Mr Troughtons cir cle by the single cross observation and in determining the point of parallelism of the mirrors the same observations may be made as witlh a sextant but in these the instrument loses not only its peculiar advantages but even would not serve so well as a sextant whicbh is lighter and its parts pur posely calculated for solidity in this kind of observations lf in terrestrial angles the two objects observed should be equally well illuminated so that the equalisation of liglht could be made constant the alternation of the angles can be effected without inverting the instrument by changing al ternately tthe object to be viewed directly by which the other will be brought to alternate equally with the position of the mirror to receive the reflection and the iniconvenient posi tion of the hand or the change of handles is avoided348 SURVEY OF THE COAST Description of the Plane Table and the Alhidade to the same The best method of surveying the minute details whiclh are to fill up a triangulation is undoubtedly by the planie ta ble and its albidade witlh a telescope revolving in the verti cal This method will give to the detail surveyor the full result of the triangulation with respect to the relative posi tion and distances of the points to be determined in a me chanical form appropriated to the nature of hiis work and which will not only be a guide and reference but also a means of enabling him to determine his distances and to ve rify his work constantly as he proceeds and by reviewing the fundamental points to discover an error imnmediately before it may mislead him The detail surveyor can there fore proceed witlh confidence and celerity and his work will be greatly dimninished by this method as well as by saving all the work commonly called plotting necessary in all other methods which besides introduces new errors while those made in the field remain concealed until it is too late to correct them properly The plan of the triangulation being properly adapted will besides be made at once sufficiently by the mere projection of the triangulation as will be observed in its proper place The details being introduced in the field immediately under the eye will be much more niumerous miore accurate and natural so that to a man acquainted with the subject it will be easy to distinguish details and plans surveyed by this me thod fiom those taken by the theodolite or the needle The last of these instruments is the worst that can be employed for the purpose and has probably been transferred to land only from its use at sea As a hiistorical pr oof of these asser tions I shall only mention that the plane table has been used in the surveys madein East India by the East India CompanvOF THE UNITED STATES 349 under the direction of a German and on account of the ad vantages for which I gave it the preference in this work The principles of the alhidade are simple It may be ac curatelv constructed and easily verified Its properties should Ie 1 Tolevel a plane 2 To describe an exact vertical upon this plane 3 To iraw or rather indicate uponi this horizontal plane a line parallel to the vertical plane of an olbject All furtlher complications are not only useless but always prejudicial to the accuracy of some of its main properties particularly in applications similar to those intended in this work In Plate IX fig 2 3 4 4 a b is a rule of about sixteen inches long three inches broad and onetenth of an inch thick Four pillars c c near its middle rise about three inches high T7hey suipport a frame d d perpendicularly across the rule about six inches long Upon the two ends of this arise perpendicularly two uprights e e of four and a half inches in height forming the supports of the axis of the telescope The telescopefg is a regular small transit describing an exact vertical upon the horizontal axis h h without clamping stop circle or any similar contrivance It is about fifteen inches long and of about an inch and a quarter aperture It slides forwards and backwards in a tube 1 1 of four inches in length fixed to the square centre piece and may by that means be placed in equilibrium so as to remain in all po sitions by the mere friction of the axis in its supports and thie level hooks ln one of the supports is the adjustment for levelling the axis of the telescope by a capstan head screw i i There is expressly no horizontal adjustmnent for this axis to effect the parallelism of the vertical plane of the telescope with the sides of the rule because this is intended to be fixed and adjustedl by the proper filing of the Ys in the supports or the placing of the frame d d on the columns c c VOL IIZ2350 SURVEY OF THE COAST Before the object end of the telescope there is a light lengthening tube of three inches in length to keep the side light and glare forom the object glass which is very necessarv in this instrumnent The eye part of the telescope is in a long tube sliding in the nain tube By sliding it in and out the wires are placed in the focus of the object glass and by turning it in the tube they are placed perpendicular Trhere are three vertical and one horizontal wires The multiplication of the vertical wires is for the observations of transits of celestial bodies in observing transits by which a survey may be properly oriented or a true meridian drawn in it Trhe eye pieces mnay be chosen at the pleasure of the observer and in respect to their nmagnifying power they must be adapted to the middle distance of the objects wlhich may come under observation It is therefore proper to have se veral changes and it will be very convenient to have one prismatic whichi being placed so as to look upwards will serve for objects at suich an elevation as will not easily allow room for the head between the plane of the table and the eye piece and it would not be proper to give to the instru ment too great an elevation in its construction because it would affect the stability of the vertical plane of the tele scope The spirit level k lhangs to the axis by hooks and has proper adjustments It serves for the levelling of the axis of the telescope and the plane table itself The methiod of using it is too evident and simple to be detailed hiere As this instrument will in its use be placed on differenit parts of the plane table it becomes a desirable object that it shlould be as light as may be consistent wvith its necessary solidity in order that it may not affect the level of the plane table For this purpose the large rule is cut out as seen in fig 2 so as to foim only a skeleton to the outer straightt line and thie supports of the telescope In like manner the frame d d and the supports e e are cut out so that the inOF THE UNITED STATES 35t strumnent is rendered very light and at the same time very solid by the ilature of its framing It may be useful to give hiere the description of an addi tion which this instrument admits and by which it answers the purpose of a very good goniometer In the middle between the pillars c c is a socket which receives an axis of at least one inch in length and about one tlhird of an inch in diameter At both ends of the rule a 6 b there are two very thin pieces either added to the end edges or worked out in it in wlhich two points are made at equal distances fromn the centre and diametrically opposite to each otlher Another rule similar to the above and of equal breadth and length is kept from beinding below by an edge bar taper ing from the centre towards the two ends This has in its middle the steel axis to the socket of the other rule which is put upon it and held by a screw from above when the in strunient is to be usedl as a goniometer In the middle below tle rule is a centre piece either square or round withi a screw sufficiently solid to hold well and adaptable to any stand which will of course be conve niently contrived so as to suit the motion work of the plane table This table will be described hereafter A lecimal scale will then be constructed on the radius of the instrument considered as a unit wlhich therefore may be chosen so as to serve at the same time as a scale for the plane table operations The cords must be measured by a beam compass of proper length lc The numbers on the scale may be mnarked at one half their value so that when the cord measured by the beam compass is applied to it they will immediately indicate the size of half the angle which being taken from a talble of natural sines will give the an gles with great ease and if proper care is taken with corisi derable accuracy The levelling and all adjustments of this instrument are of course exactly the sanme as vhen used on the plane table352 SURVEY OF THE COAST The measuring of the angles can of course be varied and the cords of the two vertical angles can always be measured and in many cases the supplements It will le more proper to let every angle be composed of two given by the cords of two angles going off from a fixed position of the lower rule than to place the lower rule together with the upper upon a point with their poirnts placed upon each other Instruments such as I have now described at length I lhad executed in 1792 by the exact artist Develey in Lausanne in Switzerland for the Surveyors of the Comissariat Genieral of Bernie as we were Inot satisfied with the usual allhidades with lights These instrunments have in all respects an swered very well and lhave not deteriorated by long use The plane table itself ought to be about thirty inches by twentyfour in size as light as it can be nmade consistently with solidity It inay on that account be proper to have it pannelled I lhave always found that old pine board which had served long as doors or house furniture 6c was the best material for it The size above mentioned allows pa pers of such dimension as will be found advantageous while a smiall table will introduce inaccuracy by the necessity of changing often and adjusting many papers For the same reasons plane tables with frames to stretch the paper upon are to be rejected Tlhe paper must be allowed to be of great lengthi  anid a breadth of three feet and a half may well be placed on the table of thirty inches in one direction It is good to lhave the edges rounded off so that when the pa per is wound round it the part not used nmay be rolled up under the table and kept from folds or bends Thlie paper is stretched and lheld upon this table by brass or which is still better steel springs of sufficient strengyth and of the slhape and about the size seen in Plate IX fig 6 4 7 rhese sprintrs sliding over the edges of the table and holding in front admsit freedomi to thie paper around the ta ble by the greater width of the round spring part behiind The motion work of the plane table is exactly sinilar to that of the large nieedles and may be seen in Plate IX fig 5OF THE UNITED STATES 353 Instead of the pillars d d which carry the needle there alre three screws by which the uppermyost circular piece n n is screwed fast to the middle of the plane table which has for that purpose a circular part giving an additional thickness to the table in this place The piece n n is a strong circular rim eiglht inches in dia meter with six stronig radii The outer part has a bell mtie tal ring upon which it revolves upon the lower plate 1 1 to give a smoother motion than brass on brass In the centre m is a bell imietal axis about three inches and a hialf loing passing through the centre of the piece 1 1 The piece 1 1 is sitmilar to the above in shape only stronger and projecting somlewhat over it so as to admit the clamping part p which goes in a small rim cut in it all round and by which the plane table is placed in the proper direction by a tangent screw after being approximately placed by hand In ttle centr e piece 1 1 is a strong piece o o through which the axis of the upper plate passes and in which its revolu tioti inay be fully stopped by the nilled head mother screw t This centre piece has a smnall neck at o o below whlich it is fornmed ill a part of a splhere of about ani inch and a half in diameter which is held down to the lower piece r r by the sections of a hollow spherical piece q q covering the above part of a sphere In the plate r r which is again formned like the others but made the strongest of the three the rim being about an inch and a half broad and onethird of an inclh thick there are three perpendicular screws e at one hundred and twenty de grees distance from eaclh other supporting the piece 1 I upon round nobs and being tturned by their milled heads below the plate which fall exactly in the middle between the three sockets s rlhese sockets receive the joints of the brass fer rules a which nmove rouind the pin passing through them and have a strong wood screw inside in whicth wooden legs five feet long are screwed fast and extenid far enouglh out in all situations of ttle ground in order to give sufficient solidity to the table These legs have iron ferrules and points below354 SURVEY OF THE COAST At about twothirds of their length from below tlhey are near two inclhes thick tapering gradually and equally out on both sides so that the lowest end becomes the smallest and is reduced to about one inch This form of the legs adds con siderably to their strength and prevents thenm from bend ing Of these alhidades and the motion works for the plane ta bles I had only two constiucted in England though in the farther progress of the work a greater number of them wQuld be required These however might be made in this coun try using those constructed in England as models Description of the Magnetic Needles In the survey of a sea coast to which ships come under the guidance of the magnet it was of course of interest to ob serve the variation of the needle to obtain data for this inte resting element For this purpose and not with any view to its use in the actual survey two needles were constructed and I intended to join to the observations of the variation those of the os cillation and for which I had a needle of my own They are constructed exactly on the same principle as the one I had constructed in 1801 by M Esser Matlhematical Instru ment Maker at Arau in Switzerland Plate IX fig 5 is a vertical section of this instrumnent which miay suffice to explain its construction The needle z z one foot in length is in a circular box about an inclh higlh having an horizontal circle x x silvered and divided to eve ry twenty minutes A small silver vernier on the needle assists in reading the subdivisions which might however have been carried farther on the circle itself The circle is divided as usual into 3600 beginning from a radius parallelOF THE UNITED STATES 355 to the telescope The glass cover rests on three points and is held to them by the spring of a br ass ring above The needle xxhangs edgeways has a jewelled cap mount ed in brass which can be screwed in the centre from both sides to verify and compensate the parallelism of the mag netic line of the needle with the middle line of its figure which serves for the readings Four pieces are adapted outside of the needle box pro jectinig a little above it to receive a large spirit level across thle box in two situations at right angles to each other one parallel to the telescope the other parallel to the axisby whiclh the instrument is levelled The needle box has below two strong pieces b b diame trically opposite to each other These form the sockets of the horizonltal axis y c of the telescope bearing at its tlhicker side c the piece hi in which a tube of four inclhes long is fas tenied Ihrough this tube passes a telescope in all respects exactly equal to that of the plane table alhidade so that they might be interchanged in case of accident This telescope describes a complete vertical circle to which it is of course adjustable by the mnotion of the wires and it was not found proper to give it any other adjustment Its verticality is best verified by the reflection in a mercury horizon of the pole star or any other object seen under a large vertical angle when the instrument is adjusted by the level The correction is of course to be made if necessary half by the wires and half by the supports of the level The needle itself is then equilibrated for this adjustment by the brass counterpoise f he adjustments are so simple easy and apparent as to need no description TIhe needle is prevented from moving by a stop when not in use The needle case with all the above rests upon six pillars d d by whiclh it is made fast to the plate n n which is the first of the stand part of tle instrumnenit All the lower larts being exactly equal to those of the plane table I shall refer to the description of that instrumrent for further details3416 SURVEY OF THE COAST In making an observation the needle box revolves by thie rims at n upon the plate 1 1 and is clamped and the telescope pointed by the clamping and tangent screw at p If the sun or a star is observed the transits of the three wires are ob served as in any other azimuthi and the time accurately noted and detertnined by other observations When a magnetic azimuth has been observed and read off at both ends of the needle with the telescope on one side of the box suppose to the right lhand then the needle must be turned a semicircle in the azimuth and the telescope as much in the vertical and the observation repeated again exactly as in the observations with the two feet theodolite The indiscriminate mean of these two observations witlh their four readings must be taken for the result as it will be corrected for the eccentricity of the needle and the eccen tric position of the telescope A more minute description of the operations will not be necessary The inversion just mentioned ought never to be neglected in any use of the magnetic needle wlhatever as no reliance can be placed in the results without it It rnay be proper to observe that it is necessary to pay great attention to obtain what is called free brass for the con struction of all instruments in which the magnetic needle is used All castings from brass filings or borings contain more or less iron which will act upon the needle With a view to have the needle as little affected as possible I requested that the body of the azinmuth  compasses under consideration should be made of pure copper But such was not to be obtained as in England the copper in commerce is made by a precipitation from a copper solution by means of iron By this process it is always mixed with iron and therefore rendered unfit for the use intended I was there fore lead to the use of free brass as just statedOF THE UNITED STATES 357 Peculiarities of the Fire Feet Transit Instruments destined for the Observatories T he axes of the transits are generally made of considera ble length but there is probably more lost by this in solidity than can be gained by the nicety of the adjustments In eaclh of the transit instruments made by Mr Troughton for thie two observatories which were intended to be built the axis is thirtythree inches long between the supports Trhe two truncated cones which form it ineet in the middle upon a spherical piece about nine inches in diameter which receives also the two parts of the telescope exactly in the sanme manner in all respects as the transit telescope of the twofeet theodolite The bell metal ends of the axis which are abouit three quarters of an inchi in diamneter and one inch and a quarter in lengtlh rest on supports which are screwed to the flat top of the stone pillars the transit not being hung to the inner side of the pillars as was formerly the custom They are of thie following form In Plate IX fig 8 4 9 a a a a is a plate of brass about lhalf an inch thick and six inches and a half square Four strong screws b b b b fastened in the top of the stone by gypsum receive it and it is secured by four mother screws pressing it close to the stone In the middle of this plate is elevated at right angles a strong piece c c about three inches high and one inch thick in the shape of a bridge which slides in a runner cut in the plate parallel to the telescope This piece being moved by nmeans of the screw e e will adjust the telescope to the me ridian In the uppermost part of this liece is the rectangular incision forming the Ys upon which the axis revolves Be low it this piece is cut out in the form of a segment of a cir cle which is subtended by a perpendicular screw in the mid VOL II3 A358 SURVEY OF THE COAST dle d which can be moved by its milled head and presses with its lower part against the cord part of the same piece below the upperscrews in the bridge thus forcing its middle up or relaxinig it by the mere spring of the metal This is all the adjustment wlhich is allowed to the supports as it is supposed that the stone pillars and therefore the plates may be brought within these limits by previous levelling and thereby greater stability be obtained  About five inches from both ends of the axis are two strong rings of about four inches diameter turned exactly on their edges Fhese turn upoll perpendicular rollers of the same diameter which are pressed against them fromn be low instead of counterpoises by means of springs enclosed in circular boxes about eight inches long which press up wards the square slide bearing the rollers The springs are moderated from below by a screw at the lower end of the cy linder Trhese counterpoising arrangements are fastened to the inner sides of tthe pillars in thie same manner that the pans of the transits rising between the pillars usually are There is neither semicircle nor alhidade nor clamp of any kind to keep the transit in a certain position  as all arrange ments of that kind are very apt to disturb the verticality or accuracy of the circle described by the transit whiclh induc ed Dr Maskeline to remove them from the transit of the Greenwich Observatory and to substitute in their place an optical arrangement In these transits the pointing in altitude is performed by two semicircles one on each side of the eye piece on which levels move by friction around their centre with verniers and all proper adjustments These circles are numbered so as to show altitudes as they could not be adjusted to decli nations or polar distances on account of the unknown lati tudes of the fuiture observatories The verniers being there fore placed upon the proper altitude the telescope is turned upon its axis until the level is horizontal when the star in tended to be pointed at will appear in the telescopeoneOF THE UNITED STATES 359 semicircle serving north of the zenitlh and the other south of it the level for the axis of the transit is a free level hanging between the pillars and has a tube of upwards of an inch in diameter The illumination is through the axis by a lantern placed on one of the stone pillars Tro see the meridian nmark distinctly and without parallax in case of its being somewhat near as the nice adjustment will not permit us to alter the focus from the infinite distance it has been usual to adapt before the object glass another glass of the focal distance equal to the distance of the mark I considered this method liable to some objections and be sides could niot know the distances of the future meridian marks I suggested therefore the following simple arrangemenit the correctness of which  had long ago tried and which ob tained the approbation of Mr Troughton A brass plate is screwed to the enid of the additional tube placed before the object glass lhaving in its centre a hole of not rmore than half an inch in diamneter through which only the nmiddle rays of light are admitted Thus all parallax is avoided the image is exceedingly well defined and the great loss of light which naturally takes place is of no importance As these transits are not within my reach it would be in proper to enter into a inore minute description of them This task is left for the astronomer to whose care they shall be committed Ont the Astrononical Clocks intended for the Observatories About a year before I came to London a new clock had been put up in the Royal Observatory of Greenwich to serve360 SURVEY OF THlE COAST with the mural circle which Mr Troughton was then making Dr Pond gave nme the mnost favourable accounit of this clock He told me it never deviated from true timne more than haif a second anld accordingly I contsidered it proper to lhave thie clocks for the intended observatories miade by thie samie ar tist and upon the same principles as it is difficult to get a very good clock and the prices asked are proportionally far above those of chronomnieters A greater number of the lat ter are constructed on account of their constant use in the navy and naval cornmerce which formns in England the prin cipal support ol this branch of the arts as well as of the nma the tatical instrument mnaking Trhe clocks were ther efore constructed by the same artist Mr Williamn Hardv from Scotland residing in London and who is eminent for various valuable invenitions in the line of clock anid chronometer making and foI the very superior execution of all his works The scapement as well as thie arrangement of the wheelwork is of his invention anid exact ly sinmilar to the clock of thie Greenwich Observatory witlh only some small differences which I suggested in order to augmnent the stability and facilitate the reading upon the dial As I have not access to these clocks at present I caninot give as full a description as nmight be desirable I mnust therefore confine mnyself to observing that eachi of them con sists of four wlheels and has the hour wheel of ahout four inches in diameter in the backwar d miotion of the drurn car rying a plate whichi slhows the hiour througlh the dial plate It may however be useful to describe the scapement fron the drawing which I made of it in London as I kniow of no description either of it or of the other peculiarities of Mr Hardys clocks In Plate VI fig 8 91 11 t1 a a a is the scapenienit wheel with thirty teeth rhe piniouis go on jewels It stands beyond the

Thiese are held fast to the piece e by the lower screws g ag and by means of the upper screws f f they can he adjusted to more or less pressure in their lower parts These form the sloping and impelling part of the scapemnent whichi is thier e fore regulated by them All the four springs have circular hloles at exactly equal lheight immediately below the triangular piece e and between the two strengthening rims h h where they are weaketned so much as to presetnt only a very light spring in their ac tion upon the scapemient wheel At that place also the springs are bent so as to make tlheni tangents to the scapement wheel Each of the springs n n bears at i a ruby mounted in brass and adjustable by the small screws k k projectinig from the spring towards the clock over the scapement wheel wlhicih is stopped by their fallinig alterniately withini the circumfe rence of the wheel upon a tootlh when they are not support ed by the pendulum in its mnotion These rubies stand

in or out as the adjustnment of the fall of this spring nmay require At the end of the springs are light brass pins o o projecting outwards over the pendu lum s to mneet the inclined lplanes p p at the two ends of the cross bar of the pendultun By thiis the springs are al ternately lifted to disengage the scapement wheel The two springs in m bear at the distance of one tooth farther on each side

unstopped so that oi362 SURVEY OF THE COAST the side at whiclh the wheel is stopped the tootlh is at the top of the inclined plane and on the side wher e the top falls be tween two teetlh a tooth stands below the inclined plane These two springs have also at their end each a light brass pin r r reaching to the same inclined planes p p which ter minate the cross bar of the penduluml This inclined plane or pallet meets these pins exactly wlhen the stop i is disen gaged anid the oscillation of the pendulum is completed anl the pirs press upon it by the strength of thie returning spring to give to the pendulum the necessary impulse after eachi oscillation This impulse is moderated by the screws ff and the iniclined plane returns by the same power of the spring into such a position between two teeth as brings the screw whichi is more distant exactly at its lower end Tflie succession of these motions alternating between thle two sides forms the scapement Their equality and coin cidence with the motion of the pendulum is adjustable by a small horizontal movement of the bar p p upon the pen dulum which is directed by a short arm or tooth z tur ninig upon the pendulum by means of a key and fitting in an in denture of this bar The motion is stopped by the pressing screw y in the middle of the cross bar the hole being sonme what elongated to admit a small horizontal motion The pendulum s s is suspended from a strong brass bar u u passing over the upper ends of both plates of the clock and supported agreeably to my suggestion outside of the pendulum by a strong square pillar t which stands under it and is screwed below to the same strong brass plate upon which the clock itself is screwed fast The spring v which forms the suspension of the pendu lum is mounted in a brass piece w sliding in a slit of the bar u and there kept in its proper place by a steel pin crossing over the piece u u The pendulum rod is adapted to the spring by a steel pin x crossing both To determine thie centre of oscillation in the suspending spring v this is again perforated the horizontal diamneter of the round hole being exactly in the same horizontal planeOF THE UNITED STATES 3 63 with the horizontal diameter of the four hioles of the springs in order that the motion of the pendulum and the spring nmay o off as from one axis to avoid all friction in the touching of the pins r and o upon the inclined plane p Thlie pendulum rod itself is a parallelopipedon of steel one tlird of an inch broad and onetenth of an inch thick The cormnpensation for temperature is made by a mercury column about seven inches high and 19 inches in diameter includedl in a glass cylinder which serves as the lens of the pendulum It is therefore adjustable by experiment and completely at the disposal of the observer and for any latitude rhere is also a screw at the end of the bar by wlich this arrange ment is suspended to it and by wlhich the length of the pen duluim itself is adjustable This pendulum is well known by the name of the Mercu ry Compensation Pendulutn  and it is evident that it was the only one adapted to my purpose as I was unicertain in what latitude tlle observatories would be built On general prin ciples any competnsation of a pendulum must compensate for the sunm total of the effect of temperature upoll the going of the clock and not merely for the expansion of the rod itself It mnust therefore be determined by experience and observation as a rod compensating itself exactly in a pyro meter would not for that compensate every clock and these clocks would not be compensated by it on account of the influence of the temperatuire upon the scapement springs The jewelling of the larger pinion holes of a clock does not appear to me to be of any advantage The pressure upon them appears too great and on that account occasions a grinding of the pinions rherefore only the scapements are jewelled in these clocks The other pinion holes are boxed with lbrass taken from a piece brought to England from Bengal as a sample which was given by the Board of Longitude to Mr Harrison the first inventor of chronome ters At his death Mr Hardy bought it and uses it with the greatest economy for such purposes The ends pp of the cross bar on the pendulum are also lined with this brass364 SURVEY OF T1HE COAST The dial plate is thickly plated with silveir in order to pre serve well the whiteness whichl facilitates the reading while the mere silvering commonly used soon beconmes so dull as to render the reading by night or fronm a distance inconve nient With the same viewsto facilitate the reading the circle of the second hand is larger tlhan usual and all useless num bers are excluded in order to give to the divisions a mnore striking appearance It was my intention to make the weiglht always move at some distance even below the lenis of thie pendulum to avoid the too great influence of it upoIn the pendulun particulalyll in the proximity of the lens as it is a well known fact that the clock will always change its rate of going in consequence of the mutual attraction between the lens and the weight In clocks which go only twentyfour hours as those de scribed above which are always wound up at reguilar times this influence occurring every day equally will on the wlhole compensate itself and the intermediate deviations occasion ed by it will remain concealed as the clock will alwavs be regulated according to its mean daily rate It appears there fore the most evident in those clocks which go a long time with one winding On a Franklin clock which I put up at West Point in 1808 and which shows only four hours and went forty days with one winding the pendulum was com pletely stopped when the centre of gravity of the weight was about ten inches below that of the lens their horizontal dis tance being three inches and a quarter the weight and lens both were considerably heavy Tro counteract this mutual influence I hung a musket ball by a thin wire from the board on which the clock rested to the point where the centre of gravity of the weight was when the clock stopped and in a few seconds it began to os cillate isochronous witlh the pendulun These two experitnents I repeated several times with ex actly equal results and though I attributed the stopping of the clock to a smiall defect in its position I made the weightOF THE UNITED STATES 365 to go in future below this stopping point and I tnever wound it up as far as that point This reduced its time of going till the weight rested on the floor to fourteen days and also destroyed the effect of the attraction of the lensand weight The placement of the clocks here described requires great care attention to solidity and various peculiar arranigements whiclh cannot be described here Without such arrange mnents they would be spoiled immediately and disappoint the expectations which are with reason entertained of them Plan of an Observatory proposed to be built in Waskiington In my plan of operation for the survey I proposed the erection of two observatories in such places as might be found most advantageous It seemed evident to me that the use of these establishments might be extended to objects of general scientific improvement independent of the survey without any considerable increase of expense  and my views on this subject were supported by the approbation of many eminent men in public life When I rendered in the accoutnts of my nmission for the instruments in June 1816 the President Mr Madison as well as the Secretary of the Treasury Mr Dallas were as desirouis as I was that this part of my plan might receive its immediate execution I thought it important that one of these observatories slhould be located at the seat of government and mnany considerations led mie to select for this purpose a part of the hill north of the Capitol and in the centre of the city Circumstances which it wouild be useless to relate here prevented the execution of this project but still it may be proper to give the plan and description of the proposed observatory as they are necessary to complete the subject VOLe 13 B366 SURVEY OF THE COASr of these papers and may at somaie future time become use ful The present state of astronomy is averse to those vast and splendid buildings formerly erected for observatories which inow stand near the snmaller buildings forminig the actual ob servatories and obstruct their view I tlherefore thought it my duty to propose a cotmnparatively small building adapted to the instrumnents initended to be used in it but still so fortned as readily to admit of enlargement if this should become necessary The principal aim in an observatory building besides pro pel shelter for the instruments and convenienice for their use is the stability of the instruments themselves so that they may be independent of the influence of any miiotion in the ob servatory itself or in its neighbourlhood rhis object is ob tained by fotunding the parts intended to support atnv instru ment at some deptlh in the earth insulating the building fromn the surrounding ground by a ditch and supporting the floor of the observatory itself upon pillars separate fronm all other parts of the building and particularly fromn the pillars that support the instrunments The instruments for which mny plan was adapted were a transit instrument of five feet ani astronomlical clock thle eighteen inch repeating circles and the large telescopes and a zenith sector of six feet ordered and yet expected of Mr Troughton It was also intended to make this observatory the place of deposit of the standards of weights and mea sures the chronometers or any other instruments of the col lection when not in use and of an appropriate library Plate VIII fig t is the plan of the observatory at the le vel of the floor fig 2 the vertical section in the direction of the rmieridian through the transit fig 3 the northern front and fig 4

west fiont each otne and the north fronit two Trhe door is in the place of the north eastern window In the middle of each of the windows the wall projects inward in formn of a semicircular pillar two feet in diamneter a a a the top of wlhichi togetther with the wiindow slhelf is covered with one flat hewn stotne fastened in the wall and three feet above the level of the floor rhis admits any moveable instru ment to be placed under the window for observationi even in thle meridian of the transit and the windows and shutters can be closed outside of it without disturbing it Thlie witndows are all five feet broad and nine feet high in the clear which will admit observations as near to the zenith as is otlherwise practicable with moveable instruments and give sufficient freedom in the azimutl not only for all cir cumnimeridian observations but also for corresponding alti tudes 1The windows and the slhutters slide by counterpoises en tirely below the window seat in the recesses b b nmade for thie purpose in the outside of the wall and covered bv a wooden firame projecting sufficiently to shelter them all Trhe covers c c of this frame form the outer part of the win dow seat and move on hinges by which means they open or shut the recess with its frame and support the windows and shiutters when these are closed The middle of the observatory is occupied by the transit which rests upon two solid stone pillars p p elevating it near ly seven feet above the floor Theirinner sides are perpen dicular and thirty inches from each other the three outer sides are tapered towards the top Their bases are about two feet square and the tops about ten inches Upon their flat tops the supports of the tranisit are fastened and on the inner sides the counterpoising spring rollers as has been de scribed in the proper place and may be seen in fig 4 2368 SURVEY OF THE COAST These pillars go tlhrough the floor without touching it and lest below upon a solid block of masonrv about six feet highi firmly founded below the excavation of the cellar on a base the breadth of which nmust be proportional to the soli dity of the material employed of which the best would be one solid block of stone Upon a similar pillar q somewhat on the side to the south east of the transit the clock is to be placed in such a direc tion as to present the face about perpendicular to the desk The centre of the second hand must be made to come about five feet eight inches above the floor for thie ease of reading and to show below the transit It can be easily illuminated by a lantern placed on the side of the pillar near it so as not to throw any light to the eye of the observer Ihe top of the pillar is regulated by the size of the clock and the base by the necessary solidity It must be indepen dent of the floor and have a particular shape adapted to the clock To admit the case to go round it without enclosing the pendulum in the stone it may rest upon the same base nment as the transit or upoIn a similar one equally solid  but there must be room made in it to admit the weight of the clock intended always to go below the floor The complaint against the snmall cuts in the roofs of ob servatories is well known and their influence in a warm climate particularly in producing a local refraction near the observer would be too great This was the reasoni for plac ing the transit in the direction of the winlows which will be opened entirely for observation The part above the window up to the roof presenting itself outside like a continuation of the wall fig 3 e e must also open completely like an inside shutter The roof over the transit between the two windows must slide out to both sides upon the other roof for the whole breadth of the windows It is composed of five double shut ters of strong sheet tin moving on round iron bars g g lying on the roof and reaching far enough in the cut to give a solid support to the shutters and if small they might go entirelyOF THE UNITED STATES 369 across withiout taking so much light from the telescope as to produce any impediment The easy motion of these shutters and their close shut ting against drifting snow particularly is an object to be at tended to carefully which cannot be described here The second instrument for which a separate stand was to be prepared in the observatory was the zenith sector This was intended to be placed upon the conic pillar d and to lhave a large and suitable aperture in the roof like that for the transit Btut as the zenith sector is not yet obtained all ar rangements could be merely preparatory and they could only be well adapted when the instrument should be at lhanid When at any future time a mural circle should be added to the observatory this was intended to take the place of the sector and tthe roof between the corresponding windows to be opened as for the transit The sector would then be removed to the corresponding situation on the other side of the transit where now the observers and guard rooms were placed the partition being taken away and an addition of one or two windows breadth being made to the east of the build ing to provide these necessary rooms Trhe entry would still renmain the same and it must be ob served that all direct communication between the actual observatory and any other room which nay be heated in winter must be avoided These roomns tnust be placed in the east side of the build ing and the fire place as much as possible towards the southi east because the northeast wind is in this country the rainy wind and therefore the smoke of the clhimney which would obstruct the observations can only be brought by the wind over the observatory when the weathier would otherwise not allow the observation to be made  and with all other winds which accompany fair weather it will be driven from the observatory so as never to be inconmmoding The floor of the observatory is supported uipon separate pillars of masonry h h built in the cellar and touches neither370 8URVEY OF THE COAST the wall no any of the pillars the joints being covered with cloth nailed to the floor to prevent the draft of the air from the cellar The under part of the floor is plaistered like a ceiling in order to prevent more effectually tthe dampness and make it a more compact body or mass Trhe cellar inust be about five feet deep as well to pre vent dampness under the floor and about the pillars as to admit easy access to these and beneath the floor in any case of need For the same reason also the bulls eye windows are given to it in the southern and northern fiont The ac cess to it may be under the step which leads to the upper room and under the main door and the bridge before it a door may be made to come into the ditch The ditch around the building must be at least four feet deep and about three feet in breadth to intercept all oscil lations of the surface of the earth which may be occasioned by wagons ec particularly in cities or near inhabited places roads tc This of course renders necessary a light bridge passinig to the door The roof is arched and elevated about twenty feet above the floor to avoid all close air under any circurnstances what ever Instruments which would reach into the upper heated air of a room would never make a good observation particular ly in such a variable climate as this My plan for the framning of a roof may be seen in the figure In the arrangement of the rafters it was necessary to pay attention to the opening in the roof that might be re quired for the additional instruments mentioned aboveOF THE UNITED STATES 371 Promiscuous Renmarks upon the Principles of Constr uction the Choice and Trial of Instruments After hiavincg described various instruments it may not be improper to add somie general observations upon the subject which my experience has enabled me to make The navy and slhips employed in commerce constitute in England the principal support of the mathematical instrument naking and lhave established this branch of the arts on a large scale and contributed to its perfection in the last cen tiry after the invention of the reflecting instruments The niext encouragement arises from gentlemen who take a pleasure and rationally amuse tlhemselves in astronomical observations Tlhese amateurs occupy the artists on instru ments of larger dimensions of greater accuracy and more complicated and varied construction The use of instruments for scientific establishments conme after these two in the line of influence rhe instruments constructed for such purposes are comparatively speaking limited as to their number and last too long to be of much consideration to those who construct them From tllis results the following state of things in relation to the instrurnent making in Etngland Thle inistruments suitable for naval purposes and for com imon surveying and levelling fuirnislh the principal support of the artist From the profits arising from these lhe pays his worknmen and brings up hiis apprentices The extent of these two branches is proved by the nunmbers which are put upon the instrumenits in regular succession Amateurs requiring from the artist a greater variety and instruments of a larger size lhe is enabled to extend his esta blishment and to employ his workmen at a greater variety of work This prevents their passing into the class of com mon mechanics to which those are really reduced who are372 SURVEY OF THE COAST confined to the making of the usual naval or surveying in struments The scientific instruments which the best artists alonie will or can make are improved by the establishment of the works for amnateurs and the artist obtains by them his credit and fame But the profit on thenm is of little consideration as the time and care which the artist must bestow upon them himself to the detriment of his profitable work renders them very expensive to hinm On this account none but artists who are in easy circumstances can execute then On the continent of Europe the case is somewlhatdifferenit The navy does not of course employ as many of these esta blishmnents as in England They are more limited in their extent divided into a greater number of branches and di rectedmore to such instruments and philosophical apparatus as are used on land The English establishments of this nature having towards the end of the last century surpassed those of the continent of Europe they have frequently supplied the latter withi in struments of various descriptions But the iniprovements to which science has given rise on the continent the delays oc casioned by the distance and the separation occasioned by the events of the last twentyeight years have established this branch of the arts again on the European continent in the hands of various artists and on a new and well principled fotundation The frames of instruments made on the continenit are ge nerally cast in one single piece and filed by manual labour Trheir diameters are three feet to avoid the spring of the metal Mr Reichenbach in Munich refuses to make any in strumnents of greater dianmeter in consequence of the bend or spring to which they are subject The English prefer such constructions as admit of turning Trhey avoid the manual labour of filinig and therefore com pose all the instruments of large diarneters of pieces that can be turned By this means the instruments are constructed lighter and at less expense than by the former mode MrOF THE UNITED STATES 373 rroughton makes use of thie spring of the metal itself for tlhe adjustment of his instruments as has been seen The comparison might be madie to a greater extent but such would not be consistent witlh the object of the present papers It will be proper however in any given case to pay attention to the nature of the establishment and the particular branches in which each artist is most distinguished that a preference may be given to such as will be likely to give nmost satisfaction Similar considerations apply to the different kinds of time pieces Chronometers are of such importance to the navy that every attention has been directed to their improvement since their invention by Mr Harrison On the contrary the itnprovements in clock making have been comparatively limited and the artists employed in this branch are not so able as those employed in the construction of chrono meters Astronomical clocks are notkept for sale as chronome ters are There are but a few constructed and those agree ably to order only As to chronometers it is hardly to be expected that among thie great numbers kept on hand by different artists there should not be some of them preferable to others If there fore several chronometers be required as was my case it will be proper to take them from different artists in order to have a greater chance of success which no artist can inva riably attach to his work It nmust be observed from the principles upon which chro nometers are constructed that they will go differently at sea from what they do on land Ihis I have proved by se ven chronometers which I kept going on my passage from London to Philadelphia and which I compared together dai ly It is evident that the constant inotion of the ship must affect the heavy balance which is never aflected when the chronometer is completelv at rest The quantity of this ef fect is of course both uncertain and peculiar to each chro nometer both in respect to quantity and direction VOL i13 c374 SURVEY OF THE COAST The delicacy of the scapement may be the cause why Englislh chronometers are very liable to momentaneous gains or losses which amount to a considerable number of seconds though in other respects they may be verv good and may again return to their usual rate It is probable that these mnay be owing to somne very slight motion which occurs just at the moment when the scapenient passes the stopping spring which then may either let the wheelwork and of course the hands pass a number of seconds or stol it for some time before it recovers its free and regular play and rate of going Trhis cannot be prevented in any voyage or journey On the continent of Europe a much smaller number of chronometers is made for the sanme reasons as stated in respect to mathematical instruments Only the most emi nent watchmnakers engage in them and they are generally speaking as successful as the English The principles upon wlhich they work are also differenit but this is not the place to enter into details on this subject It is only proper to mention that in case repairs or even cleaning should be necessary in a chronometer it can seldom be expected that anly other chronometer maker will be able to do it so well as he who has made the instrument on accountt of his pecui liar mode of working A like remnark will applywitlh greater force to English and French chronomneter makers 1 should advise the use of no chronometers but such as go only one day All that go for a longer period have by no means the same degree of accuracy It is probable that one of the causes of this arises from the too great influence of the inequalities of the springs which must of course extendover a longer space of time As it is well known that the principal difficulty in the di vision of mathematical instruments consists now in the pro per centring of the division with the axis of motion it mnay be proper to mention the manner in which this is effected and to give an idea of a dividing engine by which this error may be avoided and which 1 comumunicated to Mr Trough ton He approved of it so fully that he advised Mr ThoOF THE UNITED STATES 375 nras Jones wlho made several of the instrmtients here de scribed to make hiis dividing enginie upon the principles which I indicated When the instrument comes from the hanids of the first workman it is technically said to be tight or fitted so as to admnit little or no motion of its axis vFlhei the circle intend ed to be divided with its axis screwed to it is put in a lathe to receive thle last adjusting turning both witlh respect to thte axis and thie plane of the circle For this purpose it must turn upon two points making part of the protracted axis As it would not turn sufficiently concentric in any cotmmnon latlhe arrangement with clhucks a temporaary pulley is fixed to some convenient part for the cords of the wheel to run in The motion should be slow and steady to avoid all vacil lation and swinging Therefore thie wheel is small corn mnoildy one of those used with the hand lathe and it is turned regularly by a separate personi by hand Wlhen the axis and the plane of the circle are thus finally turned true and before any thing is chaniged in the arrange ments those circles between which the divisions are to be drawni are immediately turned upon the plane of the instru ment by the pressuire of a fine point held in a position in clined to its motion at about an angle of ten degrees so that no actual cutting takes place These circles are perfectly concenitric with the axis and are described better on a silver arch than one of brass on accounit of its more uniform tex ture anid the ease with whiclh it receives such an impression The instrument being now taken from the lathe the socket of the axis finished in the same manner is rubbed upon it with emery and oil by a kind of screwing motion until an easy and even miiotion is obtained This 4turning following always the conical surfaces by close contact has no sensible tendency to change the centre The present construction of the Fniglish dividing engines requires an operation whichl mnakes the centre of the division depend on the motion of the axis It is necessary to take 2376 SURVEY OF THE COAST the axis out of the circle to adapt this latter to the engine and consequently it is not absolutely certain that the axis be screwed again exactly in its position 5c The dividing engines have all a cetntre pin to which the instrument is centred These pins are either fixed or changeable for different diameters of axes suited to the usual and comnmon instruments Tro adapt any instrument hiaving a central aperture for an axis different from these a collar is turned having its outer diameter to fit this aperture and its central hole the centre pin of the engine But it is evident that the concentricity of these two circles is not always cer tain and that in the last turning above mnentioned the centre may have been displaced fromn the centre of the aperture which receives the axis and which was of course not turned with it The division being completed the axis is again screwed in its place and the adjustment of it is to be made bothi with respect to its concentricity and its perpenidicularity to the circle The reading of opposite verniers or microscopes must indicate the corrections which are necessary To give the axis its proper position it is necessary to raise thiree burrs with a punching tool at such places as appear to re quire it By repeated trials of this kind the axis is again centred and this operation is to be discontinued when a suf ficient approximation is obtained When an instrument has to be removed to a considerable distance these burrs may wear out by the greater pressure they sustain and the in strument mnay become eccentric by it All this troublesome operation and the disadvantages at tending it mnay easily be avoided if instead of the pin or axis the dividing machine had in the centre a circular hole of about five inches diameter and of sufficient depth to ad mit the lower parts of the axis of any instrument so that the instrument could be placed upon the engine together with the axis in the same situation as it came from the last turning and rubbing without any dismounting whatever To ease the approximate placing of the circle on the engine a numOF THE UNITED STATES 377 ber of concentric circles of proper diameters could be drawn upon the plate The axis of the engines being generally very strong would easily admit the necessary aperture in the centre and it might for that purpose have an outer diameter of seven inches without impeding its easy motion in the manner in whiich the engine is otherwise made and used All other parts of the engine would be exactly similar to that of Mr Trroughton as described in the Encyclopedia of Brewster Art Graduation The circle intended for dividing being laid upon the en gine with its axis fast to it and centred approximately by any one of the circles a compound nmicronmeter microscope is placed betweeni the two bars at the place of the cutting tool having its wires so placed as to form one or more tangents to the circle drawn on the instrument for the limits of the divisions The instrument will evidently be centred when the wire of the microscope touches this circle always in the revolution of the engine upon its axis As long therefore as this does not take place the position is to be corrected half by moving the instrument properly upon the engine and half by bringing the microscope or its wires nearer to or farther from the centre and the different circles upon the instru ment may serve to verify each other When the instrument is thus adjusted upon the engine it may be fastened by various means If melted wax be cast about the parts by which the instrument is supported it will be suflicient to keep it steady during the time required for dividing and will niot derange it by any unequal pressure In the presenlt improved state of the dividing engine of Mr Troughton accidental errors of the divisions are scarcely possible if due attention be paid to the proper stability of all the moveable parts and the regularity of treading so that no tooth of the racking whveel may be passed over and that the tracer nay not admit any vacillation in its adjustments The tracer of Mr Troughton is better than the round point comnmonly used It is grouind below to an elliptic section of378 SURVEY OrF THE COAST which the longer diameter is in the directioin of the lines and the shorter perpendicular to the same rhe intersec tion of these two lines forms below a short and sharp edge whiclh cuts witlh such ease and keenness that on silver the tool cannot even be left to press with its full weight and on brass its weiglht alone is sufficient to make a deep and sharp ly defined line in onie stroke Ihe verniers may be easily divided by placing them on the instrument itself at such a proportional distance within the circumference of the circle as the part shall be into whici they are to divide a subdivision of the instrument and then dividing as usual This produces evidently when they are removed to the circumference the loss of one division upon thieir full lenigth in their comxparison with the divisions of the circle On the dividing engine with a tangent screw this division can be made by the mere adjustmiient of its re volutions On sorne of my instruments the pin holes which served for this operation andl wviich are usually filled up again are left open that a vernier may be iestored again fiom the di vision of the instrument itself if need should be It may not be improper here to mention some of the de tails which are to be observed in the choice of instruments or in the direction of their construction  as their influence on the practical use of the instrumnents is greater than might be supposed and as they are not always attended to by every artist The quality of the miietal of which the framing part of the instrument is made is not indifferent as the stability of the instrument depends in some measure upon it If brass is used this is subject to very great variation without being ob served by a person not well acquainted with the subject The mixtures of copper and tin properly cannon metal thouglh usually called bell mnetal are muclh mnore easily dis tinguislhed in quality anid tlherefore preferable in miiany in stanices The use of this metal for the axes whlen the sock ets are brass or for thie sockets when the axes are steelOF THE UNITED STATES 379 miust be considered as indispensable Formerly the artists in England had for this purpose a still hetter metalthe tutenague imported from Chinia but now prohibited The greater hardniess of this metal was particularly favourable for the axes of transits 5c which by their frequent revolution upon the same parts without going completely round are very apt to becomne partially worn and which canniot be made of steel on account of its rusting All the nobs and sockets in which the tangent screws mnove should be of good cannioni metal for these screws being frequently used will sooni lose their easy motion if they turn in brass in conse quence of thieir close contact and equality of texture and after this they acquire an inefficient or lost motion to the great annoyance of the observer To avoid this in all cases T think it would be easy to adapt a spiral spring of steel wire around the screw between the two nobs in which the screw works pressing it alwavs to the same side of the path In the general construction of the instrurment attentioni must be paid to give to the lower parts such strength and weiglht with respect to the upper as mnay not allow of any spring This is the great difficulty which requires the obser vers particular care in the repeating circle with two tele scopes where the main weight of the instrument is support ed in equilibrio upon a small axis so that the vertical obser vation must in some measure he tnade without touching the instrument The verniers which present inclined planes to the divisions muist touch them in order to show accurately thie coincidence and avoid parallax This renders it necessary to give some spring to the arms which bear theni and care mtust therefore be taken that they do not rub the divisions and of course do not drag Mr Reichenbach in Munich avoidls this by divid ing the verniers uipon a complete circle whiclh presents it self inside to the livisions in the same plane But this re quires very nice work and as thie circle is ligt some care to prevent its wvarpirig which may be occasioned by a return of some hammered parts of it to their for mer irregular shape380 SURVEY OF THE COAST These light parts are very liable to spring back on being exposed to a considerable variation of temperature By this construction Mr Reichenbach has applied verniers in his circle of the Paris Observatory of which the diameter is one metre and which is the largest size he finds advisable to give to any instrument The English artists on the contrary use compound nmi croscopes for the readings where the diameters are above eighteen inclhes arid find them to be veryconvenient TRhese nmicroscopes and probably the readings with them are more accur ate  but they require more labour and very accurate work I have already observed that for a division by polnts the nmicrometer must have one single wire in the directioni of the radius and for a division by lines two wires intersect ing each other and inclined equally to the radius making angles of about fifteen degrees on eaclh side ot the division stroke the equality of whiich is very easily judged with great accuracy Thlie divided circle as well as the radii arms or plates bearing verniers or microscopes ought never to be attached to other parts of the instrument except the central piece in order to be in all cases equally free and left to their own spring and shape In like manner the centre piece is to be connected with the stand part alone The clamping and tangent screw arrangement ought al ways to be strong and never to be fixed to an arm bearing a vernier or a microscope It is very apt to affect it differ ently from the other verniers as it has to act on all larts as leader and to overcome the resistance of the central friction On this account it is commonly made somnewlat stronger than the others If the verniers are not attached to a full plate it will be best to give the instruiment a separate strong arm expressly for the purpose and to mnake all arms of ver niers or microscopes exactly equal Thie quality and power of the telescopes on an instrument must always exceed the detgree of accuracy which is obtainOP THE UNITED STATES 381 able by the other parts of the instrument as it serves to ve rify thiese and also gives certainty to the observer by the accuracy of the pointing I have always found in terrestrial as well as celestial observations the largest power which the telescope could bear the miost advantageous for use Great light is not an essential requisite IThe distinctness of the image and its size are far preferable as in terrestrial objects thley help in pointing miinutely and in celestial observation they increase the quantity of visible or apparent motioIn Thlie same considerations show that there is no gain in a dis proportionate aperture Accuracy of the image is lost by it as mnay be easily tried by diminishing the apertures of large telescopes by covers of different openings In the course of tny geodesical operations I was obliged onily towards winter to lay aside the greatest magnifier of the two feet theodolite of seventyseven times and take the inext of about fifty times But soon after observations at sonme distance becamiie entirely impr acticable so as to give tlhe desired degree of accuracy Tlhese circumstances render it proper to choose the dia mneters of instrutnents such as to allow with propriety and ease the application of some ot the telescopes which are ob tained in greater perfection  and in this respect it is proper to mention lhere some facts relating to this subject The telescope which is obtained the most perfect in its kind is that of three feet and a lalf focal length and about three inlches aperture For instruments the apertuire of about two inchies and a half is preferred Below that size tlhe telescope of thirty to thirtvtwo inches with the same apertures is obtained in great perfection These two regu late therefore thie size of the largest moveable instruments After this the telescope of twentytwo inches witlh about an inclh and threequarters aperture which is well suited for the eighteen inch circles is very good for its size rhe smaller sizes are nmade in great numbers andl of various qualities where almfost no distinction can be made in respect to size except VOL It3 D382 SURVEY OF THE COAST what clhance introduces  lhose however about thirteen inchfes long for some of the better geodesical instrumnents and six inches long for eflecting instruments are the most carefully attended to Above the three feet aind a half tele scope those of five feet focal length and three to four inches aper ture are frequently obtained very good  and Mr rully Optician in Islington has been very successful in them Those of six feet focal length are difficult to obtain in gr eat perfection They have the sanme aperture as the five feet ones and Mr Dollond has made some very good telescopes of this size though of course after many trials and the re jection of many glasses A good telescope of seven feet focal lengtlh and greater with four to five inches aperture may be considered as thie result of a happy chance and proportionally to wlhat is ex pected of such telescopes I lheard only of about three or four that had acqtuired a well deserved fame Of these the largest and best is the ten feet telescope with six inches aperture made by old Mr Dollond for the Greenwich Ob servatory to prove the possibility of mnaking an aclhromatic telescope equally as good as the ten feet reflecting telescope of Dr Herschel In this he actually succeeded buit only in one glass out of a number made with that view rThis tele scope has lately been adapted by Mr Trougliton to a transit instrument for the Observatory The sizes intermediate between five feet and twentytwo inches are considered as generally speaking not good For instance the fouir feet focal length is not suitable for scien tific purposes They are therefore generally mounted for pocket telescopes or spyglasses In the larger telescopes the optician is not quite certain of the focal length in the formation of his object glasses This may vary within two inches though the glasses comie out of the same fornms but such a difference is of no imnpor tance A high polish to the object glasses is not desirable in in struments The glaring light which it occasions is not agreeOF THE UNITED STATES 3883 able in observing A well defined image in a muilkish white liglt will be found more agreeable Thotgh the artists say that they can polish an object glass as much as thev choose without detriment to the shape of the glass and therefore accuracy of the image I should preter from experienlce the greater certainty of accuracy with less polish Trhe object glasses frequently contain crystallisations wlhich injure the brightness and accuracy of the image These crystallisationis become very apparent in the following mode of trial whichi I found to be the best for judging of the accuracy of the image When the telescope is adjusted and directed upon a fixed star thie eye part is drawn out Which will cause the microscope which the eye glasses form to viev in its focus successively other sections of the cone of liglht of the object glass and in proportion as the light will be equally diffused upon the circle so seeni and as it will bear to be nmore drawn out without becoming diffused the telescope will be more perfect and more accurately adjusted Few telescopes will stand a Very scrupulous trial of this kind Most generally the light will be much stronger to wardcs the circumference of the circle than in the interior anid in this wvill almost always be found some dark spots of angular shape presenting themselves exactly like crystals under a microscope wlich show the effect of the crystals in the glass throwing the light from its regular course Any stray light as the opticians call the rays which appear as if darting out of the circle is very apparent in this trial The best telescopes therefore are those which directed upon a smnall anid not twinkling star and put a little out of focus will present a shlarply defined image witlh a disk like a pla net Trhe larger this image can be made the better the te lescope Thlle opticians mneet with great difficulty infinding good glasses and in makinl large object glasses much more glass is wvasted than is used Various other circuimstances also increase the price of the larger glasses so that a good object384 SURVEY OF THE COAST glass of a lonig focus anid large aperture lhas conmpletely a fancy price But it would be too tedious for me to enter lere inlto details on this subject It nmay be proper for me to menition a source of error wlhich may affect the accuracy of the spirit levels These may generally be supposed to be adjusted at a mean tempe rature of course a mean length of the bubble At the higher and lower temperatures in which it is often necessary to ob serve the longer or shorter bubble may measure differently in the course of the level if this is not very regular besides that its oscillation will at all times become sluggislh and more irregular Tlhe manner of packing the instruments is of considerable importance for the preservation of their accuracy The boxes ought always to be of light and straight grained wood No piece must ever be fixed in a direction diagonal to the grain as it will be pressed out of shape by the drying of the wood Any piece fastened separately must always be placed in the direction of the length of the fibres In travelling the instrumeent should always be placed as mnuclh as possible in the same position in which it is used those parts only which are not fixed to it being taken off and packed sepa rately The centre being the part which hears thegreatest weight must be the inost firmly supported Any stay used to steady the instrument in the box mnust be placed against one of its solid parts No circle nor telescope should ever be suffered to touch the box nor have any bearing to sup port or steady the instrument They must be suspended freely in the box by the parts destined to hold tlhem It is even advisable in all cases in whiclh the weight of the in strunient allows this precaution to nmake the boxes as light as possible that in case of accident they may break before an effectual reaction upon the instrument can take place The larger instrum ents of the collection for the suirvey of the coast all travel in their boxes in the position used in ob servation and are supported according to the above princi ples and Mr Troughton agreed with me in preferring thisOF THE UNITED STATES 385 mode of packing to the usual one which requires the instru mnents to be dismnounted On the Mechanical Organisation of a Large Suirvey and the Particular pplication to the Survey of te Coast Thlough the mathiemnatical tlheory of suchi works is fully treated and wcll known their practical application is left com pletely to the lpractical man and the success and accuracy depend in a great measure on the organisation and the dif ferent details of arrangetment wlhich such a work requires It msay therefore be useful to give lhere sonle practical prin ciples on this subject in order to guide the operator in taking proper advantage of the time and circumstances anid to overcome the difficulties wlicll are always to be met with in practical works The application of these to the survey of the coast may serve as anl example which at the same time will give such information witlh respect to that part of the work which I lhave executed as may enable the operator to take advantage of it or to continue it in future The leadingr features of the general organisation are ex posed in the plans of operation which I presented to govern mnent anid nlow inserted in these papers and of whiclh the presenit will slhow the more detailed application The first operation is of course to find a proper place for a line of sufficient lengthl to formi the base of the triangulation in sucth a situation as will enable the surveyor to arrive by simple operations and wvith accuracy to the determination of a distanice between two elevated points in a favourable position relative to thie surrounding mountains and the coun try at large If these points be at the same timte the hlighest and freest in the neighboutrhood the multiplication of the386 SURVEY OF THE COAST chances of forming the subsequent triangles will not only accelerate the work by the greater number of points whiclh may be determined from them but also enable the operator to choose the most advantageous combination of triangles and if the survey shall extend over a whole country it is proper to begin in such part of it as will soon lead to the largest triangles possible This was the principle which induced me to begin in the neighbourlhood of New York after I had received a letter from Mr Dallas Secretary of the Treasury authorising me to begin wherever I should think it most advantageous The configuration of the country particularly the direction of some principal chains of mountains may guide us in the research for a base line because it is generally parallel witl straight ranges of mountains that the more level and exten sive plains are found and the first triangle point will fall upon some elevation in an opposite range of mountains if these be not very elevated It is therefore necessary to make first a preliminary recon noitring survey of such a tract of the country at least as iray be likely to furniish the base and a complete systems of tri angles admnitting of verification The more nminutely this can be done the more advantageous on every account will it prove for the actual survey In an uniform simnple triangulation it is most proper to place the two base lines which are necessary at least in all such works near the two extremities of the trianguflation and therefore to imake also at the beginning the necessary reconnoitring for that purpose But in my case in this work it was desirable to obtain in an early stage of the work a ve rification of the linear unit upon whiiclh the triangle was foutnded to allowv me to make tise of it for the detail stir veys as soon as possible Besides in all cases where the trianguilation is to serve for geographical purposes it may most generally be exlected that several base lines will be nieasuured in the course of the work rhis first reconnoitrinig requiring the most extensive andOF THE UNITED STATES 387 free view of the country must be made earlv in the spring or late in the fall for the naked woods will admit many views hiddeni in the summier by the branches and leaves wlhich may be afterwards cleared away for the work of the actual triangulation Such was for instance my case with the base line itself and several importanit triangle points This geometrical view of a country is by no means with out difficulties and requires great attention and a kind of geometric eye as the accuracy of the work depends fmuch oni the favourable system of triangles which is projected on these data The rmost favourable season for the actual triangulation is during spring and summer when the Iength of thie mornings and evenings will afford the longest time of favourable illu mination for observing which at the noon elevation of the sun is inadmissible In this climate this titne is often inter rupted by the frequent rains in August In the fall the atmosphere of low cotntries particularly the sea slhore becomes very untransparent and the time of the day favourable for accurate observations so limited that it can hardly ever be expected to take a full series of angles conisecutively For instance from my station at the east end of the verification base near Gravesend in December 1817 the large lighthouse off Sandy Hook only about nine miles distant was never visible a whole hour in the morn ing or evening and as soon as the ground was warm in the morning thie signal at the west end of the verification base near five miles off moved about irregularly in a circle of about one minute The winter will be fully employed in the final calculations projecting the triangles upon paper and other labours relv tive to the last summers operations and preparatory to those for the next summer This will occupy more persons than the actual observations lhave occupied in sunmmer as it is proper that all actual calculations be made at least double and by different persons The verification comparison and comlbination of thie results will take up much time388 SURVEY OF THE COAST In choosing a station and in reconnoitring due attention must be paid to select the most advantageous point of the nmountain or place for the view of all the signals required and the most conspicuous anid easily discovered fromn other places We must clear in case of need the neiglhbourhood so as to make the signal distinctly visible Besides this the ground upon which the instrument is to stand must be very solid Unless upon rocks or very dry hills the solidity will hardly ever be found such as not to affect tlhe level of the instrument by walking near it or by the different position in which the observer stands with respect to it In a simple triangulation where only few angles are ob served upon the same point it may be allowed witlhout much inconvenience to place tthe instrument at any point near thle actual signal which may be favourable for the observations anid to reduce the angles to the signal or station point by the angle of position and distance required Thus we may use steeples parts of buildings or suchl fixed points but never trees as station points ThlIis hiowever must be avoided when a great number of angles rest upon a point and it is to serve for detail surveys because the consequent calcula tion of the reductions is actually more tedious than the cal culations themselves and because it would be very inconve nient to keep account of two such near points on the papers intended for the detail surveys It must however be observed that in general steeples and buildings are always to be avoided if possible oni account of their not givin accurate signals rhey should therefore only be used for the determination of their own position and not to form points in a series of triangles In any case of such a reduction occurring I used to calcu late separately all the angles subtended by the eccentric dis tance at eachi of the signals upon whiclh angles were observ ed and to combine them according to tlhe case of each of ttle angles which I had to correct as the following equation takes place in all casesOF THE UNITED STATES 389 In Plate V fig 12 let SStation point

tound this nmetliod the simplest sliortest and least liable to mistakes When the ground at the station point is not perfectly solid it is necessary to place in the ground strong plugs or slhort posts sawed off horizontally and nearly level with each other Trhe sand hills on the low sea shores and the looming which takes place upon tlhem would have rendered necessary for these places the constr uction of a stand of abiout tventy four feet elevation solid and firmly attached to the ground upon which the instrument with its stand might be placed I intended to have had one constructed in the form of a tri anwiular pyramid but it is evident that the use of such means is to be limited as mucti as possible on account of the many inconveniences attending them The instrumients mnust be well sheltered from all weather and the sun must not shine even upon the stand or tlhe grounid near its legs It is therefore necessary to have a separate and suitable tent constructedl for each instrument with cur tains all around but separate so as open the side necessary for okbervingo without depriving the instrument of its shelter Trhe instruments are to be taken out of their boxes plac ed levelled and adjusted in all respects as soon as possible after arriving at the station  in order that they may recover fromn any unequal pressure to which they may have been subject in the boxes and in travelling so that the parts may come to rest in their proper position some time before the instrument is used TOL II3 E390 SURVEY OP THE COAST Trhe chief observer as well as all thle assistants and the la bouring men must be encamped at the station the latter not so close as to occasion any impediment or interruption to the observations by the noise of any othel necessary occu pation The living in neighibouring houses is comiipletely incompatille with the advancemtrent of tle work The safest and at the same timie most expeditious and least expensive mode of transporting the instruments is in a spring carriage constructed purposely the body of which will closely fit thie whole of the boxes of the instruments so that they stand in it packed without being permitted to shake On the first station of such a work the task of the obser ver is of considerable extent besides the nmere observation of the stations He must begin by supposing his instruments cornpletely out of adjustment which will certainly be the case witlh all moveable instruments particularlv if they hiave undergone any long transportation of any kind He must adjust them and observe with them sotne titne not with the view of the actual use of the observations in the work but in order to get acquainited with his instruments to find an easy mode of using them and to discover all their qualities and defects Absolute mathematical accuracy exists only in the mnind of man All practical applications are mnere approximations more or less successful And when all has been done that scienice and art can unite in practice the supposition of some defects in the instrumnents will always be prudent It be comes therefore the duty of an observer to combine and in vent upon theoretical principles methods of systenmatical ob servations by which the influenice of any error of his instru nments nmay be neutralised either by direct means or more generally and inuch more easily by compensation He must not leave his first station before he is so far clear upon this sub ject as to need nothing m ore than the proof always anxious ly looked for of the sumn of the tlhree angles of his first tri angles Itis not here the place to present a theorv on this subject nor to enter into practical details I will merely reOF THE UNITED STATES  391 fer to my operations witlh the two feet theodolite as an ex atnple Ihe methods thus decided upon will determine the num ber as well as the form and combination of thie observations which are required to give the greatest probability in the re sults and these mnetlhods nmust be the constanit rule for all the observations If observations which are limited by their nature to a cer tain time are made with repeating instruments the number of observations mnust be determnined by a proper combination of the theoretical formula or Irinciple used in the case the number of observations required to compensate the possible errors of the inistrument anid the accuracy aimed at in the observation This is the case for instance in circummeri dian observations ec The quantity of work which is made in one summers catmpaign thle mnlutiplicity antd variety of cases occurring ob literating naturally the accurate remembrance of the pecu liar circumnstances of an observation which however deter mine the degree of relative confidence which it deserves it is necessarv to be very accurate and rninute in the notation of every thing in the day books anid journals kept of all ob servations and other operations A certain systematic and constant formn must be observed in theem thiey must be writ ten with such regularity and perspicuity that any man witl the proper theoretical knowledge could execute the calcu lations tlhough he might have beeni unconnected with the work itself It is best to keep them in folio form to bring as much as possible under view at once in order to facilitate the taking out of the results for use in calculation to admit room for all accessory notices and bring every thing readily under the eye If assistance enougl could be had it would be proper al ways to mnake two fair copies from the first jouirnal kept un der the direction of the observer These tirst journals should 239 SURVEY OP THE COAST rather be written in ink than in pencil for greater distinct ness atid better preservation as it is proper to preserve them at least till after all calculations are made in order to be able to verity the fair copies by them in case of any doubt Thle mnethod which I adopted in this respect is evident by the exemplar given of it in these papers I distinguished the day book and jourrnal evidently only to facilitate the or der of the work by separate denominiations Every page is divided into six columns whichi suit very well for all kinds of observations and results and the headings of which go uniformly through the whole book Not having my journals of the actual work of the coast survev at my dispositioin the exenmplars are taken from the similar operations nmade for the determination of the boundary line between this coun try and Canada The day book is kept by mlintute order of time The re verse page of each leaf is destined for all the details of the observations and the direct page facing it for the itimmediate results of themn in all their details T8he further particulars may be seen in the exemplars themselves The journals of results are two fold One series of themn is destined for the vertical angles with the heading  Of the repeating circle though it contained vertical angles in general Thfe other series contained the results of all ho rizontal arngles and was superscribed  Of the great theodo lite this being the instrument used In these journals the order of the suibject is the leading principle and they subdi vide naturally as seen in the exemplars at A and B TFhe date in the first columns refers each result to its observation in the day book lThe next columns containi the resulting lines and angles 5c forming the elenment of the calculation of whiclh all the particulars are introduced in separate co lumns for the ease of the verifications Tle final result witlh the mninuite details may be seen in the exemplars I have not the opportunity of giving an exemplar for the ele vation of the terrestrial objects signals Ic over the seaOF THE UNITED STATES 393 which was of course apart froml the operation But it mnay easily be imagined how suchi a journal should be kept The tiltimate results of the vork are to be collected withi great order into a separate book The mode of doing this I cannot exemplify further than will appear from No 3 of the Journal Exemplars Trhe titles of the other columns depend in some mneasure on the forminula of calculation used the methods of projecting and the like besides the general results which will always remain Examples of it may be seen in the different accounts of measurements of degrees t5c For the assistants in the calculation it was my intention if the work had proceeded to a greater extenit to have had for mulae of blank calculations lrinted purposely which is a great means of security against omissionis in the calculations To proceed in sucli a work with the greatest advantage and celerity it is proper that various assistants and an ade quate nutnber of labouring men be with the chief operator The necessary discipline and regularity which the nature of the work requires would when possible give for both the preference to military nmen Good old soldiers will always be the best for the labours The whole work must go on with the greatest regularity to give proper confidence in the precision of it and the desired accuracy in the results The better the assistants are infornmed in mathlemratics and the more they take a proper care and active interest in the work the miiore advantageous will it be They must be fur nished with written instructions upon their respective duties and it will be proper that they change duty in regular rota tion either weekly or by station The separate journals which they will have to keep are to be signed by thlem at the end of every day to facilitate a reference to their recollec tion in case of mistake I found the following distribution of their work advanta geous One to act as secretary to the observer He is to write the namnes readinigs on the instruments tc under his dictation394t SURVEY OF THE COAST and always to repeat them aloud when he lhas written themi to prevent nistakes and if he is attentive and acquainted by practice with the proper succession of the readings lhe can in case of mistaken or inmprobable readings by warning the observer cause the correction of any mistake by a re petition of the reading before the instrument is moved In obser vations requiring the notation of the time he will couint witlh the chronometer and mark the muoment when the word is given to him by the observer A second will act as an assistant observer in such obser vations as require it observe regularly at stated hours and at the time of every observation requiring it the barometer and thermometer of whiclh he will keep a regular journal rnake the observations of the maginetic needle in cases where it is of interest as in the survey of a sea coast A third assistant will find sufficient employment in preli imiiniry calculations the nmaking of a second copy of the day book occasional attention to the signals directing the men in clear ing views and various similar occupations One of the assistants should be a draughtsman for views who slhould draw on eaclh station the view of the whole ho rizon marking the positions of all the signals so as to indi cate their place if they should be nieeded at any future time The foreground of his drawing will also aid in finding the station point itself He will also make detailed drawings of the signals as they present themselves in the magnified scale through the largest telescope with all the other ob jects accompanying it in the field of the telescope This will direct the observer in distinguislhing the signals in the smaller telescopes of the instruments froml other olbjects which it might be easy to mistake for then These drawings which will fornm a pretty large collection may assist in the proper shaditg of the elevations in the drawing of the maps  and they may serve if circutnstances sbould rnake it desirable to mnade a model in relief of a part of thie country for whicl many of the tnathenmatical data are given in the survey as the elevation of all the signals overOF THE UNITED STATES 395 the sea will be determined by the vertical angles observed at the stations These additions to the mnere horizontal survey will add more interest and usefulness to the work than might be ex pected not only in a scientific point of view but also for public utility Joined to an accurate and minute detail sur vey executed upon the principles which will be exposed hereafter all thie data should be collected to enable the go vernment to judge witlh propriety of the plan of any public undertaking or service such as roads canals ineans of de fence of the country ec That the survey of the coast was to contain all these data besides the mere outlines of the coast and that they were as necessary as the soundings out side of the line of the coast appeared to mne too evident to admit of any doubt and I would have considered the full aim of the work miissed without them Another addition particularly useful to navigation was to obtain a complete series of observations of the variation of the magnetic needle over the whole extent of the coast I intended that the magnetic bearings should be observed at all the stations every day by an assistant the needle being stationary in one point for that purpose  but during the short time that I worked the multiplicity of my other occupations and other circumstances hindered me fionm doing more than just to observe it once myself at the close of each station An oscillation needle which I have and wlhich has heen observed in Paris in London and in Washington was in tended to be observed also regularly at eaclh station The union of these two kinds of observation would have given an interesting result relative to this subject It will not be necessary to enter into the reasons which dictated the establishnment of one or nmore observatories con nected with the chain of triangles thereby to bind the work to one or more permanent points astronomically determined The advantage of such an arrangement is perfectlv evideuit The following is thie mnost proper order of the operations on a favourable day at any station Every days work must396 SIURVEI Of TIlE COAST be brought to approaclh as near to it as possible It will slhow that no idleness is adnmitted as the omission or loss of the points here mnentioned would occasion ani encroachmlent upon the next day or perhaps its recovering be long inmped ed by circumistances I suppose the observer to be furnish ed with at least one instrumenit for vertical angles and one for horizontal angles time pieces a barometer thermometer sextant and artificial horizon The observer must be at his instrumenits one hour before sunrise to test their solid statnding clean them with a feather from sandy dust whichi is so often introduced by the winid into the open axes and upon the limbs 5c If they need atny oil in the openi axes mnerely passing over the finger is sufficient He mnust level the instruments and verify all ad justimients adjust the collimation line and the focus of the telescopes and the reading microscopes to clear vision and complete fieedotn fiom parallaxes and veritf the value of their readiing For all this the quiet state of the atmosphere and the coolness of the mnorning with the full licght which precedes the risinlg of the sun furnish the most favourable circumstances His instrument mnust necessarily be in good order and need very little of all these adjustments ec it he shall be ready abouit sunrise as he should and this will be the case if he has devoted the proper attentions at the begini ning of the station Tlhen he will level his instrument finally and the rising of the sun will the proper nmoment to observe the angles upon the signals within abotit 40 oni each side of the southern meridian until such time as the sun is about its double dia meter above the hiorizon in case of a southern declination or oni the six oclock meridian wlen in a northern declina tion  at which time it is proper to take one or two azimuths of the sun in the mainer indicated at the proper place Ilhese azitmuths nmust be followed immlediately by obser vations of zenith distances or altitudes of the sun for the de termnination of the timne whicb it is necessary to hiave as fIee from the rate of thie chronometer as possible and whicihOF THE UNITED STATES 397 shoultd therefore be made during the azimuth observation it self if assistants for that purpose are at hand After these observationis the instrument having been veri fied again thie observations of terrestrial angles will be con tinuel upon the signals from thie fore mentioned sittuation to about due north unitil near ten oclock if the illurnination of the day is tavourable About ten oclock correspondinig al titudes may he taken with the sun for whicth the easiest and probably most accurate method will be to take with a re flecting instrument the contact of both limbs of the stun no ting the time and laying the instrumlent unidisturbed and care fully aside to observe the same again after noon This will avoid everv influence of any error of the instrumnent Dur ing the middle of the day the state of the atmosplhere and the illumination are so unfavourable to the observation of terrestrial angles that none must be observed the objects being all seen in the shade and the reflection from the sig nals and any object in general passinig high over the obser ver In a hot summer day the illumination will even cease to be favourable after 9 oclock But wlhen the sun has a low southern declination it may sometinmes be possible to observe somewhat longer upon signals nearly north This is therefore the time to transcribe the observations into the day book to take out the results of the terrestrial angles to exarnine them make such preliminary calculations as may be required to determine the time and rate of the chronometer and arrange the work of the afternoon 4c About thirty minutes before noon it will be necessary to adjust the vertical circle and prepare for the circummneridian observations of the sun For though it is not absolutely ne cessary in a triangulation to determine the latitude of every station by actual obseivation still it is not proper to let the sun pass the meridian without observing it as every observa tion is all addition to the mass of this kind of observations whichi it is necessary to lhave as large as possible and they are all reduced to one point by the geodesical calculations VOL TT 3 F398 SURVEY OF THE COAST within such linmits as will not admit too great an influence of the figure of the earth upon the reduction After this observation tirne tnay be allowed for dining attenition being paid however not to mniss the corresponding altitudes of the afternoon the time of which must be calcu lated approximately before hand Between three and four oclock the favourable time for the observation of terrestrial angles may begin again sometimes a little later seldom earlier There will be little time to lose after the corresponding altitudes and the calculation of their result before it will be necessary to commence the levelling of the theodolite and the revision of all its adjust ments The illumination will now become favourable for the sigm nals in succession from due north past thle east to about south or somewhat farther according to the declination of the sun as this forms the element of the angle of reflection from the signals to the observer By this it is also evident that the time for accurate observations upon terrestrial objects be comes always more limited on both sides of noon as the de clination of the sun becomes lower and an attention to this subject will have a great influence on the accuracy of the re sults The order of the observations in terrestrial angles azi muths Sc in the afternoon will be exactly the reverse of that of the morning except that though it was possible to observe with and read on the instrutnent in the niorning before sunrise this will not be possible after the sun is set The task of the day is still not over For it is necessary to introduce all the observations of the day book to take out all the results and introduce them into their proper place in the journal of results or at least into a register of the results of the station to examine and comnpare them in order to see what degree of accuracy has been obtained hitherto and what is yet needed to complete the work of the station and to plan accordingly for future observations It is inecessary toOF THE UNITED STATES 399 do all this before any derangement of the instrumnient has taken place that any discrepancy in the results may be tested and corrected immediately This will most likely not allow an early rest to the obser ver Therefore it will lhardly ever be possible to do what would now be advantageous viz to observe circurnmeridian zenitth distances of stars in the night particularly to the north to compensate the influence of the instrunment upon the ob servations taken to the south with the sun and correct the result by their means The observer will be obliged to re serve hiis strength for the work of the next day as his ob servations would lose much of their accuracy if lhe should be overfatigued Stich night observations are therefore only possible when he has assistants able to take a part of the task of the day from him Niglht observations require besides a temporary observa tory built for the purpose and appropriated to the instrument used like one wlhich I hiad constructed for the work of thie bouudary line with Canada It is proper tlherefore that a peculiar and suitable station be selected to make a regular and well conmbined series of observations on the latitudes with all the necessary means and arrangements for accuracy As it will then be possible to obtain many more observations of stars than of the sun their number and kind may be so combined as to serve as a full compensation for all the observations of the sun mnade at the otlher stations and which are to be reduced to this by calculation It will naturally occur that at such a station a complete series of azimuths may also be observed by a variety of me thods and with every means of accuracy and that after such a station has been mnade it will not be necessary to ob serve them on the neighbouring stations The indispensable observations of longitude are of course to be referred to the permanent observatory of the country if such a one exists if not they also become necessary at 2400 SURVEY OP TIlE COAST such stationls more particularly as are made for the series of the observations of latitude without however excluding the observations of occultations or eclipses whiclh may occur on any station and which it would never be proper to omiit Those observations only deserve cotmplete reliance in any kiiid and case whatever whiich are made under proper arrangements and with ease to the observer A strong glare of light which dazzles the eye and an inconvenient position of the body must always prevent the accurate pointing of the instrumenit and reading of the arcs The ease and con venience of the observer are therefore not luxuries but are necessary to the accuracy of the observations Though a detailed account of the work of the survey of the coast executed during the year 1817 in whichi I worked at it would not be of any general interest and could not in fact be given as my papers have been delivered to the go vernment yelt I will present here by way of record a sketch of the principal triangles executed either fully or partially and add a few notices which may give an idea of the ar rangement and plan of the work and of the accuracy ob tained It is evident that of the accuracy which I ainmed at nothing could be abated if the work were to be such as ought to be expected in the present improved state of science The chance of an accumulation of errors upon such a long extent of seacoast as that of the United States particularly in the direction in which it lies wvould have been too great the consequences of a want of system and care would have be come too glaring not to bring discredit and shame upon a less accurate operation The different parts of the work would have given occasion to make a number of determinations of the lengtlh of degrees of longitude and latitude Fromn its extent and position it would have had particular interest and nmight have served as the foundation of a system of weights and measures for this country The principal base line was of somewhat more than nineOF THE UNITED STATES 401 thousand metres and between Cl and Vr Plate IX The first triangles lie upon the points W and Cr In the first all three angles were measured and W formed of course the main point In the second the angle at Ch could not be measured on account of a near wood which hid the whole mountain upon whicIh Cr was  while a highi signal in Ch was distinctly observable from Cr From the next point BN all the foregoing were observable and vice versa This gave occasion to bring upon the linie F and BN the results of both into comparison where from three triangles of which all three angles were measured and three in which two had onlv two angles measured the two results werethrough W15508s8 metres and through Cr1550886 metres In the triangles the sum of thiree angles which I am un able to state from recollection was satisfactory I had not yet all the angles measured in the complete systematical order whiclh I explained in treating of the two feet

numnber of angles I had in general Tfhe triangulation being now continued through Sp rN LS WE and EE of which the stations rN and LS could not be observed for want of time the verification base be

measured twice with the chain carefully and if I recollect right there was hardly threetenths of a mnetre difference in the results As this base was intended for a standing one for the work in general thie neighbourhood of it was suraveyed in detail pre viously in order to lay it out in the most advantageous posi tion for the future accurate measurement with the apparatus described in its place The base between WE and EE being intended as has been stated above only for an early verification of the linear unit of the work ill order to be enabled to begin the detail surveys as soon as possible would most likely not have been remeasured but another one at a greater distance from the first substituted for it in the continuation of the triantu lation The chain with which they were measured was made pur posely of links of a metre in length which as they do not bend into all the small inequalities of the ground are far pre ferable to small links The coincidence of the two bases was under these circum stances of course above expectation and as it gave such a proof of the accuracy of what had been done has brought it far within the limits of what it would in any suitable scale be possible to show upon paper it was of course considered suf ficient to serve to ground the detail surveys of the neighbour hood on the triangles executed from these which are seen in the sketch The point H was intended for the continuance of the sur vey to the east connected with W the points Sp and B were intended for the same purpose towards the south The distance HF having been determined both through W and through Cr had given a coincidence sufficiently sa tisfactory for the few angles which it had been possible to measure upon H from Cr and W which would of course have been repeated in the further operations and corrected by the observations on H itselfOF THE UNITED STATES 40O Through W the result was4239203 metres Through Cr the result was4239 164 The other coincidences beincg equal to these in general it appeared to me evident that in applying the method de scribed when treating of the two feet theodolite in the angles of the main triangles I could reach the accuracy of less than one second in the sum of the three angles with full certainty always and that only one pair of direct and reversed obser vations was fully sufficient to determine any near detail point that it was thcrefore most advantageous to observe them in this imanner fromn any station where they would be visible as this gave a verification from different bases The azimuths observed gave results equally satisfactory so far as they were calculated but as their calculation was not completed when the work was interrupted what had been done was again cast away as it did not present a final result and might by being considered as such rather mislead than serve for any useful purpose This was so much the more proper as they were all to be considered as merely preliminary I had built in Newark in my garden a small observatory which could be determined fronm BN and in which I intend ed to make a regular series of latitude longitude and azimuth observations as stated above It will easily be observed in the sketch of the triangles which are the stations on whichi I observed any angle the lines of the triangles being there drawn full while to the points on which I had not observed they are nmerely dotted The angles of elevation of the principal points were taken on all stations so that their relative height can be calculated To reduce it to the level of the sea I levelled actually from the point N down to the water this point being close to the shore in the narrows upon the high easter n bank The results of all that relates to this lhave not been calcu lated as this could only take place after the calcutlation of the distances The geodesical parts were of more importance to obtain first as they lay nearer to immediate use404 SURVEY OF THE COAST Latitudes were observed on various stations for temporary use in the deternmination of time 5c The longitude was taken frorn the genieral acceptation of the longitude of New York  buit all this to determine accurately was of course re ferred to regular observationis in the tenmporary observatory built for the puripose lThe organlisation of the detail surveys always depends upon the adrninistrative views according to which the work is to be executed Its details nmust therefore be omitted in the present papers Reguilar and lull instructions must be given to the detail surveyors in writing both on the principles which they shall rnake use of in their works and on the objects to be attended to Ilhe nature of the first is indicated to them by the instruments wlichl they are to enmploy and by the papers containing the triangulations which are given themn to fill up with the detail notices wlhich shall accomnpany themn The mere elementary mathematical part is sufficiently treated of in a number of wor ks Tlhe latter must be reduced into regu lar tables forning the questions which they shall answer by filling thenm up and in an extensive work thiey should be in printed formule Their nature in the survey of the coast is evident fromn what has been said before upon this subject I intended to plan such instructions after my summers work was finished The plane table is the most appropriated practical means that can be used for actual surveying in this case It is also the rmost accurate anid expeditious Every othler means will be found to require more labour anid to multiply the chances of disadvantage and error This part of the work is much more expensive and te dious than the triangulation The surveys must be laid down on a large scale 1 at least The ports and harbouirs ought to be at fw And all may be brought to an assemi blage with convenience and propriety in the scale of f at least If the governments of those States through which the sur vey of the coast was to go could be induced to take an inteOF THE UNITED STATES 405 rest in this part of the work I considered the utility of tlhe work would he muchi extended bothl for thie general govern inenit and those States the proportionial expenditure muci ditiuinishedl by their distribution anfd the final execution more accelerated that could be possible by any other meanis In the execution of the triangulation it was easy to suit some peculiar want or interest of any State This would have added double value to the work for this State withlout in creasing the expenditures and the work by any amount worth consideration Some remarks upon the best niethods of transferring the result of the trianigulation to paper may be inserted here as fiequently much of the accuracy of the wvork is lost by in sufficient imethods and these are left to the knowledge and practical skill and experience of the operator thoughl the an alytical formulwe of calculation and the principles of projec tion hiave been treated repeatedly and extensively In former works I have always found the calculation of the points in degrees minutes seconds and decimals niore convenient for this use than those in linear measures and as thie approxitmation can be carried by thie decimnals of se conds farther than it is possible to subdivide actually upon paper there is no accuracy lost particularly as all the deci mals are always preserved in summing ul any numbher of results that concur in thie determination of a point just as the logarithms obtained in the calculation are always used in any place where the results are required and not again a logarithm of the number found anew any loss in tthe frac tions in transferring to paper having tlhereby no farthiet influ ence than upon the point itself I made a table of the values of the mninutes seconds and decitmals of latitude and longitude for all those parts of the projection which had been calctilated for the subdivisions of the different trapezii which were traced by the projection and which I comnmonly male only of five mninutes at tnost botlh ini latitude and longitude in order to bring the distances VOL i3 G406 SURVEY OP THE COAST to be laid off from them within the limits of usual dividers and in this manner every point was laid off by rectatigular ordinates from the nearest sides of the trapeziumn of the pro jection The accuracy of the projection is therefore the basis upon which the accuracy of thie whiole work depends atid to this great attention is to be paid It will on every stheet begin by a right anmrie in the nmiddle extending over the whiole pa per both in latitude and longitude and to obtain this with accuracy as well as in all other parts of the construction it is necessary to assist the eve with a magnifving glass to aug ment the sharp vision of the small points which it is only al lowed to make if the sinking of the beam compass shall not introduce errors in the work It is not allowed to use any compasses buit those with rec tangular points For the smaller parts the proportional beanm compasses No 46 of the Catalogue of Instruments were intended rlhey are very convenient in the hand and easy to support against making too deep points Tro prevent the beam compasses from making deep impressions and to ease their guidance I used to suspend them over the table by a roller with a counterpoise It is evident that in no case whatever a method of laying off a point by means of an angle any how constructed can be applied in these works The only place where these are adnmissible is in the plane table operations and in laving oM points of soundings with the station pointer observed by the prollem of three points Trhe projection which 1 intended to use was the develop ment of a part of the earths surface upon a cone either a tangenit to a certain latitude or cutting two given parallels and two vt eridians equidistant from the mnidldle meridian and extended on both sides of the meridian and in latitude only so far as to admit no deviation from the real nmagnitudes sensible in the detail surveys I had just comnmenced some calculationis relative to the questionwhich radius of the earth was most advanitageous to admit the greatest extent toOF THE UNITED STATBS 407 the projection under the above condition whether the geo centric radius of the latitude the radius of curvature of the meridian at the tangent poirit or the radius of the sphere tan gent to the spheroid at the point Further than this I had not proceeded when I abandoned the subject by the inter ruption of my work It is at all events necessary that these projections go off from different points of latitude and be all of equal extent from the central meridian and parallel in order that the de viations from the real nmagnitude nmay never becorme so great as to require the application of correction for the plane table operations which determine of course the details in the neiglhbourhood of any point of a triangle from the posi tion of these points as laid down by the projectionand that in bringing the different parts together their points on the edges may meet again completely being equally affected by the projection In eachi of these sheets it was intended to bring the results of several parallels so that tlle central meridian alone should become a straight line and all the other meridians and pa rallels broken lines niearest the curve to which they belong the angular points of the trapezium being transferred to pa per by their rectangular ordinates from the middle right angle calculated from the angle at the centre of the projec tion in the protracted axis of the earth The papers to be given to the detail surveyors should be divided differently viz they must always contain those points and extend over such parts as nmay by the natture and configuration of the country be best adapted to be surveyed together But the points rnust be laid down upon them ac cording to the place which thev would occupy in the above regular distribution of the projections This distribution of the projection in an assemblage of sections of surfaces of successive cones tangents to or cutt ing a regular succession of larallels and upon reaularly changing central meridians appeared to nme the onlv one408 SURVEY OF THE COAST applicable to the coast of the United States Its direction nearly diagonal through imeridian and parallel would not ad nmit any other mode founded upon a single meridian and pa rallel without great deviations from the actual magnitudes and shape which would have considerable disadvantages in use Their uniotn in one general map on a small scale would be exceedingly easy and in mnaking a nminute projection could almost be done without the aid of instrumentsOF THE UNIT2ED STATES 409 iammisauazI OP THE

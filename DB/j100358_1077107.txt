ON THE VALUE OF HUMANISTIC PARTICULARLY CLASSICAL STUDIES THE CLASSICS AND THE NEW EDUCATION III THE CASE FOR THE CLASSICS PAUL SHOREY The University of Chicago No subject is too stale for a rattling speech and the mere praise of the classics and the exposure of the adversary still supply good matter of rhetoric1 But this paper is to be printed and I hope with the aid of footnotes to make it a sufficient though of course not exhaustive historical resume and a repertory of temperate arguments adapted to present conditions2 To this end I am prepared to sacrifice not only its temporary effect on an audience but any ambition I might feel to attain the symmetry and classicism of form which befit a classicist speaking in his own cause and which are so admirably illustrated in the apologies for classical studies of Mill and Jebb and Arnold3 1Cf Professor Formans Humble Apology for Greek Cornell University I904 printed privately 2Cf infra pp 6o00 Even in i868 Professor Gildersleeve had to

REVIEW The situation has improved since I had the honor of speaking here fifteen or sixteen years ago and many topics which I dwelt on then may be lightly enumerated today The wearisome controversy has educated the participants on both sides4 Both are more careful in their dialectic and more cautious in the abuse of exaggeration and irrelevancy5 Our opponents have grown very shy of the kind of logic which delivered them into our hands though they still grotesquely misconceive the nature and aims of our teaching6 But only a few incorrigibles still harp on the false antithesis of words and

thoughtful there is a reaction in our favor They may not accept our estimates of the transcendental worth of the classic literatures or the unique discipline of classical studies But they have lost

limits of translations are no longer likely to be misunderstood Few will now be misled either by Laboucheres statement that Bohns translations had shown up the classics or Emersons saying that he would as soon swim when there was a bridge as resort to the original in place of a translation or Professor Moultons argument that trans lations are as good as the originals for the teacher of general literature And though we sometimes meet the fallacy that posed Gibbons aunt the argument that the students own version is inferior to the printed translations of great scholars which he might use instead it is merely as Gibbon says a silly sophism which could not easily be confuted by a person ignorant of any language but her own There is no oppo sition between the use of translations and the study of the original On the contrary even a little aquaintance with the original adds immensely to their usefulness They are tools which are best employed by those who have some insight into the method of their construction22 For some purposes they may be almost as good as the originals But among the pur poses for which they are not so good are classroom disci pline the development of the critical intelligence and the habit of exactness and the maintenance of high standards of national taste and culture in the educated classes23 Hypothetical Language the elaboration of the same old

controversial and negative work we may take for granted the conventional positive and construc tive arguments for classical studies elaborated by a long line of able apologists except so far as we have occasion to sum marize or refer to them in the course of this review24 These arguments are not exclusive but cumulative The case of the classics does not rest on any one of them and is not impaired by the exaggerated importance that mistaken zeal may attribute to any one Those who still harp on the superiority of the classics as discipline 25 do not therefore tacitly acknowl edge themselves beaten on the point of their intrinsic value 26 and those who prefer to emphasize the necessity of the ancient classics for the understanding of modern life and letters 27 may still believe that highschool Latin is the best instrument of discipline available in secondary education28 The March number of the Classical Journal tabulates the aims of classical study as stated by teachers in

acquaintance with Greek and Latin literature Obviously there is nothing incompatible in these aims It is a question of emphasis the needs of the class the ability training and tastes of the teacher A faddist may ride his hobby to death whether it be optatives or lantern slides or parallel passages from the poets But in return the good teacher will almost in the same breath translate a great poetic

the difference between the classical and the modern or romantic spirit so that you shall not know whether he is teaching science or art language or literature grammar rhetoric psychology or sociology because he is really teaching the elements and indispensable prerequisites of all Similarly of the diverse considerations urged by former apologists and the contributors to these symposia The case of the classics rests on no one taken singly but on their conjoint force and it is not really weakened by the disproportionate stress sometimes laid on the weaker arguments The illumina tion of scientific terminology for example is a minor and secondary utility of a little knowledge of Greek and Latin on which the biologist or physician is especially apt perhaps over much to insist That is his contribution He does not mean to rest the case on that He is not answered by the argument that ten or twelve years of study is too big a price to pay for this result and that terminology can be learned from glossaries For a very slight knowledge of the languages makes an immense difference in the intelligence with which the dictionary or the glossary of scientific terms is consulted and the vividness with which its statements are realized One or two years will yield a good deal of that particular utility and the question for the teacher of science or medicine is whether any other non 592THE CASE FOR THE CLASSICS professional college study is likely to be more useful to his students29 So in arguing that the classics give the engineer a power of expression which he requires for use as well as for ornament Professor Sadler30 is not committing himself or us to the proposition that none but classicists write well and all classicists do He simply means what all experience proves that the study of the classics is on the whole an excellent train ing in expression31 perhaps a better one than the unpremeditated effusions of daily themes 32 and that discipline in the power of exact and lucid expression is a utility for the engineer33 Again Mr Kelsey would be the last to rest the case for the classics on the fact that the wider secondary study of Greek would leave the door of choice for the profession of the ministry open to a large number of desirable candidates who now find too late that they lack the indispensable preparation34 But it is a real if minor consideration to be counted in the sum All of these contributions from the professions take for granted the general discipline and cultural values of the classics and presuppose the fact pointed out by Mr Loeb and others that the direct business and technical utilitarian value of the so called practical college courses is very slight On this assump tion they supplement the ideal values of the classics by showing that in the jargon of modern pedagogy they also possess adjustment values for other professions than theology and literature One consideration however which constantly recurs in these discussions is fundamental It is the training which the classics 29 See Dr Vaughan in School Rev 1906 392 30School Rev I906 4025 31 A writer in Educ Rev XXXVIII 8890 argues that the difference of pronunciation makes Latin useless to the English of the highschool student 32 Cf Mr Barrett Wendells sad surmise The Mystery of Education I75 that perhaps the reason why the uptodate Harvard student doesnt write like Addison is that Addison had never studied English composition as a thing apart But Addison had studied Latin composition and had a very pretty knack of turning Latin verses 33Cf Outlook XCIII I907 87 34 School Rev I908 56779 593THE SCHOOL REVIEW give in the art of interpretation Classicists sometimes claim for and scientific men concede too much to the study of the classics as a means of developing the powers of expression35 They underestimate its value as a discipline of the intelligence86 They appreciate its stimulus to emotion They fail to apprehend its subtler effect in blending and harmonizing the twosuffus ing thought with feeling informing feeling with thought In controversy Huxley and Tyndall were fond of pointing out that the leaders of science expressed themselves with rather more vigor point and precision than the ordinary classicist And their own vivid and fluent eloquence drove the argument home In general however men of science are only too ready to concede with the irony which apes humility that their training has not supplied the graces and literary refinements that are supposed to qualify a man to shine after dinner or to make a good appear ance on the platform But the gifts of eloquence and fluency are sparks of natural endowment which science perhaps quite as often as philology fans into flame37 Scientific men may make haste to forget their Latin as Latin But the mere classicist observes with admiring despair their mastery of the polysyllabic Latin ized vocabulary of English Where he says if so they say in the contemplated eventuality We must abate our claim that only the classics make men eloquent and emphatic in the expression of their own thoughts But it is impossible to claim too much for them as a disci pline in the allimportant art of interpreting the expressed 35 Huxley op cit I30 36 Bentleys Dissertation on Phalaris the type and model of philological method has been aptly styled a relentless syllogism No one can compare the discourses of Renan and Pasteur at the French Academy or the Romanes lectures of Jebb I899 and Professor Lankester I904 without feeling that the superi ority of the trained classical philologian is not solely or mainly in the graces It is in the intellectual qualities of subtlety wit sanity breadth coherence and closeness of cogent dialectic that his advantage is most conspicuous As we are speaking of disciplinary values it would be beside the mark to allege what Renan and Jebb would be the first to admit that Pasteurs work was of greater service to mankind than theirs 37 On the bad style of classicists cf Pop Sci Mo I 707 Gildersleeve op cit 49 Spencer Study of Sociology 267 594THE CASE FOR THE CLASSICS thought of others There is no other exercise available for educational purposes that can compare in this respect with the daily graduated critical classroom translation and interpretation of classical texts38 The instinctively sane judgment of intended meanings the analytic power of rational interpretationthese natural gifts being equal are the distinctive marks of the student of classics in varying degrees from the secondaryschool Latin ist who at least has some inkling of the general implicit logic and structure of language to the collegian who has been exercised in the equivocations of idiom and synonym and the finished master who can weigh all the nice considerations that determine the precise shade of meaning or tone of feeling in a speech in Thucydides a lyric of Aeschylus a halfjesting halfserious argument in Plato Information knowledge culture origi nality eloquence genius may exist without a classical training the critical sense and a sound feeling for the relativity of mean ing rarely if ever I have never met in private life or encount ered in literature a thinker wholly disdainful of the discipline of the classics who did not betray his deficiency in this respect I say in all seriousness that what chiefly surprises a well trained classicist in the controversial and popular writings of scientific men especially in the case of the pseudo or demi sciences39 is not any awkwardness of style or defect in culture but the quality of the dialectic and logic the irrelevancies the elaborations of metaphors from illustrations into arguments40 the disproportionate emphasis upon trifles and truisms41 the 38 The argument of Webster Forum XXVIII 459 ff that the study of a language makes almost no demands upon the reasoning powers refutes itself cf Jebb op cit 558 Laurie Lectures on Languages and Linguistic Method 910

historical and philological interpretation of the context The way in which the classics provide us with this training can be fully appreciated only through experience47 I have attempted a description elsewhere in this journal48 and it has often been set forth by others and most admirably by the representatives of the law in these symposia49 The law itself is the only discipline comparable to the classics in this regard50 But while more severe perhaps and strictly intellectual it is narrower in its range 51 and does not include the union of feeling and intelligence which makes the study of the classics an incomparable method of general education For this reason though the law would be the best available substitute for the discipline of the classics thoughtful lawyers would be the last to advocate the substitution But it is time to turn from these special considerations to a broader view of the whole subject Classical education is not an academic superstition an irrational survival of the Renais sance52 It is a universal phenomenon of civilization Higher nonvocational education has always been largely literary and linguistic and it has always been based on a literature distin guished from the ephemeral productivity of the hour as classic It was so at Rome in China in Hindustan and among the Arabs The Greeks whose supreme originality makes them an exception to every rule are only an apparent exception to Middle Ages for Renaissance ibid 14950 and his consequent contradiction of his own admission on p 209 that the study of classical literature familiarized men with

own older classics to form not inform their minds54 This universal tendency is only in part explained by the religious or superstitious rever ence for sacred texts It is in the main due to an instinctive perception of the principles on which the case for the classics still rests The education of those who can afford time for nonvocational study is not in the narrower or more immediate sense of the words a preparation for life 55 but from the point of view of the individual a development of the faculties from the point of view of society the transmission of a cultural social moral tradition56 It must be a broad discipline of the intellectual powers that shall at the same time attune the aesthetic and the moral feelings to a certain key57 No study but that of language and literature can do this and it is best done through an older and more synthetic form of language and a literature that is in relation to the student and his environ ment classic58 This is the meaning of the late W T Harriss somewhat cryptic Hegelism that selfalienation is necessary to selfknowledge69 Or to put it more concretely the critical interpretation or translation of such a language

literature elevated above the trivialities disengaged from the complexities disinterested in the conflicts of contemporary life 60 awakens the aesthetic and literary sense61 ennobles and refines feeling62 And the very definition of classic implies that it is the source and chief depository of the national tradition either of religion or culture or both For modern Europe these conditions were fulfilled by the study of the classics of Greece and Rome which the Renais sance established in the face of a scholasticism that called itself science63 and which adapted to altered conditions we have still to defend against the exclusive pretensions of sciences that uninformed by the temper of humanism threaten to renew the spiritual aridity if not the intellectual futility of scho lasticism The debate which began in the reaction from the Renais sance and found its first notable expression in the famous quarrel of the ancients and moderns is now more than two hundred years old64 New arguments

discretion adapt them to the present conditions and throughout to insist on a vital distinction which defines the issue today I refer to the distinction between past adjustments or reductions of

did for the men of the Re naissance is not even a presumption that they count for little or nothing66 Apart from all technical considerations of curricula degrees and educational machinery it is broadly desirable that classical studies should continue to hold a place in higher education fairly proportionate to their significance for our total culture They will not hold that place if the representa tives of the scientific and modern subjects enter into an unholy alliance with the legions of Philistia to swell the un thinking clamor against dead languages and useless studies Whatever the talking delegates of science may say in their haste thoughtful scientific men 67 require no professor of Greek to tell them that the languages and literatures of the 1300 years of continuous civilization from Homer to Julian subtend a far larger arc of the great circle of knowledge than Sanskrit or Zend or the other specialties to which they are so often compared Whether they hold this

protests of French liberals against the former official require ment of a classical education for access to all professions and public offices are transferred to American conditions to which they are wholly inapplicable74 The arguments of Sydney Smith denouncing compulsory Latin verse writing and of Macaulay holding a brief for the University of London against the obstruc tionist prejudices of Oxford or elaborating a false antithesis between the Baconian and the Platonic philosophy are taken from the context 75 and used in support of policies which Sydney Smith and Macaulay would have been the first to deplore It is time to recognize that the work of Huxley Tyndall Spencer Youmans and President Eliot has been done once for all The mere man of letters who affects to ignore and despise science may have existed in Huxleys England Today he is as extinct as the dodo The enemies of science of whom Professor Lankester complains are speech automatisms surviv ing in the rhetoric of science The victory of our scientific colleagues is overwhelming and the Cinderella 76 pose is an anachronism77 Huxley was fighting to reform schools in which all boys whatever their tastes were compelled to compose Latin verses and in which as he said with gross but then pardonable exaggeration twelve years hard study of Greek left the victim unable to construe a page of easy prose And so today professors of science who are not quite Huxleys step out of their palatial laboratories and splendidly equipped offices to thunder against the obstruction of modern progress by classics in schools where not 2 per cent of the students learn the Greek alphabet where no one is required to study Latin and few do study it more than two or three years They forget that if Huxley were with us today he

One point only concerns us here Sociology and the new psy chology have staked out the entire coast of the unknown conti nent of knowledge and claim all the hinterland Abstractly and a priori this is

American student will if the universities encourage the spirit of philistinism to create an atmosphere in which the study of Homer and Sophocles cannot live104 You may perhaps reduce classical studies

school onefourth of the students time for four or five years is enough for the acquisition together with the power to read Cicero and Virgil with pleasure 6I5THE SCHOOL REVIEW of more English than classmates who omit Latin will probably learn It is not a formidable undertaking except for students whose attention is too dissipated and whose minds are too flabby to master anything that must be remembered beyond the close of the current term There is and always will be ample room for a reasonable amount of Latin in any rational scheme of studies that extends four or more years beyond the graded schools Latin is a necessity in anything but an elementary or purely technical education Greek is not in this sense a necessity17 Neither is it a scholastic specialty It is the first of luxuries a luxury which no one proposes to prescribe for all collegians but which ought to be enjoyed by an increasing proportion of those who are now frightened away from it by exaggeration of its difficulty or by utilitarian objections that apply with equal force to the inferior substitutes which partisan advisers recommend in its place The value and the charm of even a little knowledge of Greek has often been explained8 and has been repeatedly demon strated in the courses in beginning Greek offered by American colleges in the past decade Students of good but not extraordi nary ability have while keeping up their other work read six books of the Anabasis in the first year of study have completed in three years the AB requirements of the University of Chicago including eight books of the Odyssey two Greek trage dies and Platos Apology and Crito and have in the fourth year of study read the entire Republic of Plato with intelligence and delight These facts and similar results obtained in other uni versities are verifiable by any unprejudiced inquirer and they make it difficult to characterize in parliamentary language the 7 I cannot pause to discuss the misconception of those representatives of science who argue not quite seriously perhaps that if only one ancient language is to be studied it should be Greek This might be true for Mars or China It is plainly not true for that Europe which was evolved from the Roman empire and which until the second or German Renaissance received the inspiration of Greece mainly through Latin literature 11 See Jebb op cit 57580 A Popular Study of Greek President Mackenzie in School Rev I908 376 adds the weighty suggestion that those who do not possess these weapons of a full Christian culture will tend to read only what is easy and avoid scholarly works that contain even a few Greek words or Latin quotations 616THE CASE FOR THE CLASSICS 617 persistent misrepresentation that eight or ten or twelve years exclusive study of the classics yields no results comparable to those achieved by the normal student in other studies In the light of this experience no fairminded dean or judicious adviser of students already biased by unthinking popular prejudice can refuse in Lowells words to give the horse a chance at the ancient springs before concluding that he will not drink119  Latest Lit Essays I 53

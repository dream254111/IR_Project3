BECAUSE HE IS REALLY TEACHING THE ELEMENTS AND INDISPENSABLE PREREQUISITES OF ALL SIMILARLY OF THE DIVERSE CONSIDERATIONS URGED BY FORMER APOLOGISTS AND THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THESE SYMPOSIA THE CASE OF THE CLASSICS RESTS ON NO ONE TAKEN SINGLY BUT ON THEIR CONJOINT FORCE AND IT IS NOT REALLY WEAKENED BY THE DISPROPORTIONATE STRESS SOMETIMES LAID ON THE WEAKER ARGUMENTS THE ILLUMINA TION OF SCIENTIFIC TERMINOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE IS A MINOR AND SECONDARY UTILITY OF A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF GREEK AND LATIN ON WHICH THE BIOLOGIST OR PHYSICIAN IS ESPECIALLY APT PERHAPS OVER MUCH TO INSIST THAT IS HIS CONTRIBUTION HE DOES NOT MEAN TO REST THE CASE ON THAT HE IS NOT ANSWERED BY THE ARGUMENT THAT TEN OR TWELVE YEARS OF STUDY IS TOO BIG A PRICE TO PAY FOR THIS RESULT AND THAT TERMINOLOGY CAN BE LEARNED FROM GLOSSARIES FOR A VERY SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANGUAGES MAKES AN IMMENSE DIFFERENCE IN THE INTELLIGENCE WITH WHICH THE DICTIONARY OR THE GLOSSARY OF SCIENTIFIC TERMS IS CONSULTED AND THE VIVIDNESS WITH WHICH ITS STATEMENTS ARE REALIZED ONE OR TWO YEARS WILL YIELD A GOOD DEAL OF THAT PARTICULAR UTILITY AND THE QUESTION FOR THE TEACHER OF SCIENCE OR MEDICINE IS WHETHER ANY OTHER NON 592THE CASE FOR THE CLASSICS PROFESSIONAL COLLEGE STUDY IS LIKELY TO BE MORE USEFUL TO HIS STUDENTS29 SO IN ARGUING THAT THE CLASSICS GIVE THE ENGINEER A POWER OF EXPRESSION WHICH HE REQUIRES FOR USE AS WELL AS FOR ORNAMENT PROFESSOR SADLER30 IS NOT COMMITTING HIMSELF OR US TO THE PROPOSITION THAT NONE BUT CLASSICISTS WRITE WELL AND ALL CLASSICISTS DO HE SIMPLY MEANS WHAT ALL EXPERIENCE PROVES THAT THE STUDY OF THE CLASSICS IS ON THE WHOLE AN EXCELLENT TRAIN ING IN EXPRESSION31 PERHAPS A BETTER ONE THAN THE UNPREMEDITATED EFFUSIONS OF DAILY THEMES 32 AND THAT DISCIPLINE IN THE POWER OF EXACT AND LUCID EXPRESSION IS A UTILITY FOR THE ENGINEER33 AGAIN MR KELSEY WOULD BE THE LAST TO REST THE CASE FOR THE CLASSICS ON THE FACT THAT THE WIDER SECONDARY STUDY OF GREEK WOULD LEAVE THE DOOR OF CHOICE FOR THE PROFESSION OF THE MINISTRY OPEN TO A LARGE NUMBER OF DESIRABLE CANDIDATES WHO NOW FIND TOO LATE THAT THEY LACK THE INDISPENSABLE PREPARATION34 BUT IT IS A REAL IF MINOR CONSIDERATION TO BE COUNTED IN THE SUM ALL OF THESE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PROFESSIONS TAKE FOR GRANTED THE GENERAL DISCIPLINE AND CULTURAL VALUES OF THE CLASSICS AND PRESUPPOSE THE FACT POINTED OUT BY MR LOEB AND OTHERS THAT THE DIRECT BUSINESS AND TECHNICAL UTILITARIAN VALUE OF THE SO CALLED PRACTICAL COLLEGE COURSES IS VERY SLIGHT ON THIS ASSUMP TION THEY SUPPLEMENT THE IDEAL VALUES OF THE CLASSICS BY SHOWING THAT IN THE JARGON OF MODERN PEDAGOGY THEY ALSO POSSESS ADJUSTMENT VALUES FOR OTHER PROFESSIONS THAN THEOLOGY AND LITERATURE ONE CONSIDERATION HOWEVER WHICH CONSTANTLY RECURS IN THESE DISCUSSIONS IS FUNDAMENTAL IT IS THE TRAINING WHICH THE CLASSICS 29 SEE DR VAUGHAN IN SCHOOL REV 1906 392 30SCHOOL REV I906 4025 31 A WRITER IN EDUC REV XXXVIII 8890 ARGUES THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF

THEMSELVES WITH RATHER MORE VIGOR POINT AND PRECISION THAN THE ORDINARY CLASSICIST AND THEIR OWN VIVID AND FLUENT ELOQUENCE DROVE THE ARGUMENT HOME IN GENERAL HOWEVER MEN OF SCIENCE ARE ONLY TOO READY TO CONCEDE WITH THE IRONY WHICH APES HUMILITY THAT THEIR TRAINING HAS NOT SUPPLIED THE GRACES AND LITERARY REFINEMENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO QUALIFY A MAN TO SHINE AFTER DINNER OR TO MAKE A GOOD APPEAR ANCE ON THE PLATFORM BUT THE GIFTS OF ELOQUENCE AND FLUENCY ARE SPARKS OF NATURAL ENDOWMENT WHICH SCIENCE PERHAPS QUITE AS OFTEN AS PHILOLOGY FANS INTO FLAME37 SCIENTIFIC MEN MAY MAKE HASTE TO FORGET THEIR LATIN AS LATIN BUT THE MERE CLASSICIST OBSERVES WITH ADMIRING DESPAIR THEIR MASTERY OF THE POLYSYLLABIC LATIN IZED VOCABULARY OF ENGLISH WHERE HE SAYS IF SO THEY SAY IN THE CONTEMPLATED EVENTUALITY WE MUST ABATE OUR CLAIM THAT ONLY THE CLASSICS MAKE MEN ELOQUENT AND EMPHATIC IN THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR OWN THOUGHTS BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CLAIM TOO MUCH FOR THEM AS A DISCI PLINE IN

SHAKESPEARE AND HIS MILTON NEITHER IN MY BELIEF WILL THE PROFOUNDEST STUDY OF HOMER AND SOPHOCLES VIRGIL AND HORACE GIVE IT TO HIM THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER AN ENGLISHMAN CAN BUT WHETHER THE AMERICAN STUDENT WILL IF THE UNIVERSITIES ENCOURAGE THE SPIRIT OF PHILISTINISM TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH THE STUDY OF HOMER AND SOPHOCLES CANNOT LIVE104 YOU MAY PERHAPS REDUCE CLASSICAL STUDIES

TEACH THE HISTORY PHILOLOGY AND HIGHER CRITICISM OF ENG LISH LITERATURE IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU HAVE HELPED TO CREATE105 IN SHORT AS WE SAID TO OUR SCIENTIFIC COLLEAGUES THAT THE CASE OF THE CLASSICS IS THE CASE OF SERIOUS DISCIPLINE IN EDUCATION SO WE WARN THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MODERN HUMANITIES THAT THE CAUSE OF ALL HUMANE CULTURE AND HISTORIC CRITICISM IS BOUND UP WITH THE STUDIES THAT WERE THE FIRST AND REMAIN THE HIGHEST HUMANITIES THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THE VIEW THAT TENNYSON MILTON GOETHE DANTE AND RACINE ARE AS OBSOLETE AS VIRGIL AND SOPHOCLES AND THAT THE MODERN MANS SOLE REQUIREMENTS ARE TECHNICAL EXPERTS CHEAPLY HIRED INDEXES TO HOLD THE EEL OF SCIENCE BY THE TAIL THE COMMAND OF A NERVOUS COLLOQUIAL ENGLISH STYLE A TYPEWRITER GIRL TO CORRECT HIS

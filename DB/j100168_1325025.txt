Co v McCarter 209 U S 349 The right of the state to preserve its natural resources to itself would seem to be as great in the principal case The interference with interstate commerce seems no more direct But the nature of the states property right in wild animals and in streams as compared with the complete private property right of the owner of natural gas reduced to possession differentiates the cases See 25 HARV L REV 76 The principal case seems clearly right State ex rel Corwin v Indiana  Ohio Oil etc Co 120 Ind 575 JUDGMENTS  OPERATION AS BAR TO OTHER ACTIONSDAMAGE TO PERSON AND

the plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendant Shapiro v Wendover Hall Co 45 N Y L J 2082 N Y Sup Ct Aug I9II In the absence of an agreement to repair a landlord is not liable for personal injuries to a tenant or a member of the tenants family guest or servant who stands in the same position as the tenant due to the defective condition of the demised premises where the defects are not hidden defects existing at the time of letting known to him and unknown to the tenant Akerley v White 58 Hun N Y 362 Galvin v Beals I87 Mass 250 And even if he has agreed to repair it has been held that he is not so liable  either in tort because the failure so to repair is a mere nonfeasance or for substantial damages in con tract because damages for personal injuries are not recoverable for such a breach Cavalier v Pope I906 A C 428 Schick v Fleischhauer 26 N Y App Div 20o He is however liable for the condition of the part of the premises under his control both to the tenant and to third parties lawfully on the premises except bare licensees Lang v Hill 138 S W 698 Mo Miller v Hancock I893 2 Q B I77 For personal injuries to third parties more over where he makes a covenant to repair
